<p>社評</p>
<h3>精神總動員</h3>
<p>「成於一，敗於二三」，中日勝敗之哲學基礎，此其一也。在中國：抗戰則存，不戰則亡；而萬般苦難，皆由日本侵略；士氣之盛無論矣，試察之戰區，或慘遭轟炸之城市，雖骨肉死傷，家室盡毀，備受磨折，命在須臾者，亦决不怨及抗戰；此種人同此心，心同此理之現象，可謂遍中國而俯拾皆得鐵證。在日本：國會議員，猶以對華用兵之意義與目的爲質問；民間徬徨而懷疑，反戰思想漸表面化；其陣亡士兵之書信日記，尤充溢厭戰情緒。雙方逈殊，中國必成於一。</p>
<p>雖然，更從而充實之，鍛鍊之，則抗戰之成就必更宏偉；日前重慶電稱，中央頒發國民精神總動員綱領及其實施辦法，蓋就旣備之同心同理，加以充實鍛鍊，由抽象而演爲具體之軌範也。其關於綱領者，列舉國民精神之共同目標三；曰國家至上，民族至上；曰軍事第一，勝利第一；曰意志集中，力量集中。備舉忠孝仁愛信義和平爲國民精神總動員之八德，而標舉忠孝爲本。以三民主義爲建國之唯一信仰，亦即以完成三民主義之目的，爲國民精神總動員之歸宿。對於精神之改造，尤重五端，曰醉生夢死之生活，必須改正；曰奮發蓬勃之朝氣，必須養成；曰苟且偸生之習慣，必須革除；曰自私自利之企圖，必須打破；曰紛歧錯雜之思想，必須糾正。至於領導動員，則責之於黨員與公務人員，全體軍人，全國各界領袖，以及全國靑年。更各就其組織之領導人員，爲實施動員之主體。於其實施，則先之以擬定具體計畫，務求貫澈所屬分子；更利用固有團體，注意聯絡進行，以底於「總」之完成。</p>
<p>其間最爲我人所欲介紹於社會者，厥爲實施之事項。誠以精神總動員云云，易知其必要，易知其必行；然亦似甚廣泛而難定界說，似甚渺茫而難切實際；抑且有錯覺焉，似乎發動抗戰以來，羣情鬱勃，出錢者曾出錢，出力者曾出力，雖謂已經精神總動員可矣。然而不然。有待實施之事項無多，固未可謂廣泛；皆屬日常生活所接觸，固未可謂渺茫；以此事項，揆諸現實，有待人人努力，始得事事兌現，而目前情况固與精神總動員之完成甚有距離也。是何事項？</p>
<p>（一）關於改正醉生夢死之生活者：甲，整飭國民之日常生活，取締一切不當娛樂：乙，禁絕奢侈虛靡及一切無謂浪費，丙，限制消費，减少奢侈品之輸入：丁，勸導國民减低生活水準，實行普遍的緊縮。</p>
<p>（二）關於養成奮發蓬勃之朝氣者：甲，愛惜光陰，愛惜人力物力：乙，擴大戰時生產，增進全國工作時間及效能；丙，組織與訓練民衆，於戰時工作予以適當之分配。</p>
<p>（三）關於革除苟且偸生之習性者：甲，宣傳日本政略戰略之失敗，與華軍愈戰愈强之實情；乙，檢舉一切游閒怠惰分子，强制戰時服役；丙，肅淸對國際上之依賴心，徼倖心，及中途妥協之幻想。</p>
<p>（四）關於打破自私自利之企圖者：甲，切實肅淸貪汚；乙，鼓勵國民毀家紓難，以個人財產，捐助戰費；丙，搜集一切軍需物貲，貢獻國家政府；丁，切實推行以精神或物質，貢獻於國家之各種運動。</p>
<p>（五）關於糾正紛歧錯雜之思想者；甲，整飭民衆團體之組織及其訓練；乙，統一文化團體之組織及工作方針；丙，取締有礙抗戰之論爭及非法活動；丁，糾正各種報章刋物之言論傾向。</p>
<p>右舉事項，我人旣以爲現實情况，與此標準猶多距離，而以上海一隅爲距離最遠；然一般社會之旣能若此趨嚮，則亦不容掩也。自趨嚮而幾於標準，在乎充實趨嚮之力量，以期增進趨嚮之速率；而所以充實力量之方法，猶在乎意志與行動之鍛鍊。前不云所頒之綱領與實施方法，以領導動員，責之於黨員與公務人員，全體軍人，全國各界領袖，以及全國靑年乎；是在上海，尤期諸社會領袖與靑年，以及各界各機構中之領導者！莫謂推動非易，實效難期；盍假想精神總動員獲有三五分乃至八九分成績後之社會，竟爲何種氣象之社會，則吾知有志有爲之士，必身體力行而邁進矣。</p>

<p>（重慶）（續昨）敎育上最基本的任務、在於國民人格的陶冶、要全國國民陶冶人格、就不能不要求全國敎育界認淸自身地位和責任、集中到一個目標之上、以身作則、來造成普遍的風氣、這裹我有幾句重要的話、要提示我們敎育界的諸君、第一件、我要求我們敎育界、認淸「尊師重道」的意義、學記上說、凡學之道、嚴師爲難、師嚴然後道尊、道尊然後民知敬學、第二件、我們要陶冶國民人格、必須有一致的標準、在訓育上、共同的要目、訓育實施細則、儘管可以因地域階段而互異、訓育的標準、可能作共同的决定、現在我們各級學校、往往各自制定而不一致、我個人的意見、認爲總理仁孝博愛信義和平八字、可訂靑年及黨員守則、全國低級學校、可以禮義廉恥四字爲共同的校訓、這四個字、包含我國固有的國民仁義、包含國民必具的品格、我們以「禮」的含義、敎訓國民互助合作、以「義」的含義、來訓育國民使負責任肯犧牲、以「廉」的含義、敎訓國民刻苦耐勞、辨別公私、守職份、洗侵越、以「恥」的含義、訓國民自强自勵、知奮鬥、知進取、這樣固幾千年來深入人心的敎條、造成現代國民的品格、而然後得民族的生存與發展、第三伴事、我要求我們敎育界、齊趨向集中目標、爲實現三民主義而努力、我們自民國十七年四月第一次敎育會議、决議了推行三民主義敎育案以後、到今天、已過十年、就是十八年中華民國敎育宗旨的頒布、距今也已十年了、在抗戰以前、我們全國民衆和一般靑年、實際上還沒有普遍三民主義的敎化、就是在抗戰的現在、還不能眞誠一致的信奉三民主義、這固然是國家的不幸、實在也是我們敎育界共同的恥辱、</p>
<p>集中於三民主義下</p>
<p>我以爲革命建國的最高原則、如果不能普遍傳授於民衆、則革命是無法成功、國家是無法股離危險的、我們敎育界負着存亡興衰的大責任、對於立國最高原則、决不可陽奉陰違、形式上是接受、而實際上還是各逞所見、各行其是、敎育的責任、是敎民、民無信不立、如果敎育界先是心口相違、不講信義、不重實行、我們如何能導引民衆入於意志統一精神集中的地步、我們知道國家民族盛衰興亡、中外古今、何代不有、凡是轉危爲安、必定由於知識份子和敎育界從衆志紛岐、民氣衰頹的當中、集中志同道合的人爲一個目標而奮鬥、來担負責任、現在抗戰已入最重要階段、敵人所畏忌的、就是我們革命救國的三民主義、我們敎育界耍救國家危亡、就不可不以實現三民主義引爲自身的責任、中國國民黨對於全國有志救國的賢智之士、始終是殷切期待、加入本黨、共同奮鬥的、尤其在此國家存亡呼吸的抗戰時間、對於全國先知先覺各大學校校長敎授、更切風雨同舟之感、我們革命同志愈多、抗戰力量愈大、而建國事業、不僅愈易、而成功時期亦必愈速、</p>
<p>一心一德自立自重</p>
<p>我們要革命加速成功要爭取勝利、至少要担負敎育責任的同胞們、同心一德、爲三民主義而努力、以敎育的努力來講、如荀子勸學篇、「目不視而明、耳不聽而聰」、也是說明敎育的志向、必須定於一志、如果於四達路的歧點、目不正視於一端、耳不聽於一向、徘徊迷亂的結果、是敎不出勇於爲學、篤於力行、救國救民的學者來的、現在國家處於非常時期、時間不能等待、國事不容再誤、過去敎育上趨向不堅定、信守不專一、已經躭誤了十載光陰、造成了嚴重的國難、我竭誠希望我們敎育界、爲國家民族的前途、爲現代靑年和後代國民的幸福、而眞誠確實的歸於一致、我望我們敎育界各位賢達、一心一德、都集結到三民主義之下、爲中國革命而努力、我們全國敎育界本身、自抗戰以來、都是加倍的辛苦、特別顯著我們的努力、我們在戰區在淪陷區域內、在遼遠的地方、都看到敎育界辛苦奮鬥的成績、我敢說、這些耕耘的勝利、一定會培出民族復興的果實來的、我們大家所希望的、自然不在當前的酬報、而是建國大功告成以後、給予我們的安慰但是我們敎育界、必須自立自重、專心一志、以百年樹人的抱負、和舍我其誰的民氣來實行、我上面所說的話、貢獻於以終身從事敎育救國的人士、古人云、鍥而舍之、朽木不折、鍥而不舍、金石可開、這是有志竟成一定的道理、我以十分的誠意、祝本屆會議超越各界的成功、祝我們敎育界、爲抗戰建國建立無可限量的功績、（五日電）</p>

<h3>柏林反感</h3>

<h3>日軍侵海南島　南進政策發軔　法將以軍人充任越督　使防務計劃早日完成</h3>
<p>（東京）　據此間今日消息、關於日本佔領海南島之行動、早爲日本海軍有力份子所主張、蓋日本海軍部關於日本應向南發展之宣傳、已歷有數年、最近日本某政治經濟雜誌、尙載有某海軍大將主張向南發展之論文一篇、該文先論南洋各地媒油錫以及其他各項資源之豐富、繼卽提出口號稱、「爲日本帝國之國富計、日本應向南發展」、又歷來日本對內之宣傳、除謂南洋各地資源豐富外、多謂南洋土著皆赤身、裸體、跣足而行、故日本之廉價布匹與鞋襪、必能暢銷無阻、蓋南洋土著生活程度極低、僅能購買日貨故也、故日本若能向南發展、則荷屬印度與南洋其他各地及菲列賓之市塲、皆能爲日本所得、且此項市塲、在理論上固可以和平之方法獲取之、但事實上、則絕不可能、蓋自一九三三年來、荷屬印度頒佈限制輸入法後、日貨輸入荷屬東印度卽大受打擊、日貨百分四〇之輸出品、包括織物及五金在內、皆爲排擠以去、一九三四年日方與荷屬東印度方面會議之結果、日貨之輸入荷屬東印度、分量更見减少、於是可見和平方面實已碰壁、故海軍方面遂有運用武力之主張、同時、海軍方面對於煤油·錫·橡皮·極威需要、而此等物產皆以荷屬印度爲特多、再則、日本陸軍對華作戰、已獲有相當之榮譽、但日本海軍則投閒置散、英雄無用武之地、有此種種原因、遂有最近佔領海南島之行動、再則此種行動實爲日本向南發展之初步行動、海南與安南相去不過數百英哩、眞所謂近在咫尺、且佔領海南島之後、日本更可與其太平洋之代管島構成犄角之勢、對菲列賓取左右夾擊之勢也、設自日本代管島辦一航空錢以至海南島、則可横貫菲列賓、又據此間外籍外交界觀察、日本佔領海南島之原因有四（一）因法國拒絕日方以松岡洋右爲駐法大使、（二）因法國議會最近曾主張凡自日本輸入法境之貨、必須冠以「日本製造」之字樣、法國此種行動、日方多認爲抵制日貨之先聲、（三）自慕尼黑會議之後、東京方面多認民主國家並無攻擊獨裁國家之力量，（四）爲進攻民主國家東方殖民地之根據、至其他所謂「軍事必要」等等、則純屬欺人之談、（四日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>日軍佔據後　合肥商業已陷停頓　日駐軍內部發生衝突</h3>
<p>字林報云、皖中區含有皖·豫·鄂三省各一部份、屬中政府指揮下游擊軍之第五軍事區、三閱月前、孫將軍奉令平定皖中土匪、並組織游擊隊、統率第六師游擊隊之一部份、孫氏統治有方、今鄉區中幾不聞土匪騷擾、農民各返其家、鄕郊滿植小麥、華軍管理區域中、無種植雅片者、故生土價格頗昂貴、每兩約値二十六元、上月間、兩軍僅作戰三次、鐵路被游擊隊一度拆毀、</p>
<p>文通受阻　數日、兩週前、駐合肥之日軍若干名、向城外南郊二十里處出擊、生還者不足二十名、二月二十一日游擊三面襲合肥、向守城衛兵射擊、旋雖引退、但表示華方游擊隊已作更完善之準備、而逐日軍出皖中也、東自合肥北達津浦路、西及豫境、南至安慶之公路、均遭游擊隊破壞、以防日軍機械化部隊之行動、游擊隊並杜絕食物售入合肥、亦不使日貨自合肥運入鄕區、故城中居民一寓人、僅能向城東日軍控制區內之農民購買米糧蔬菜、</p>
<p>合肥城中　商業、已趨停頓、但離城二十里各村中之商業、則頗繁盛、蓋距城五里外之鄕區、均爲游擊隊所控制也、合肥日當局固切欲人民返城復業、但因深懼游擊隊、及在城門口嚴密檢查、致不能達其目的、就金融觀點而言、該城乃「祇出不進」也、合肥日當局內部亦有摩擦、蓋人民貧困、日僞方面收入殊微、擬設妓院賭窟、以爲</p>

<h3>人行峭巖上白雲起足下　漫山遍野入西康（續）　在崎嶇道中滑竿登嶺　於瀘定江上過鐵索橋</h3>
<p>登飛越嶺</p>
<p>二十三日晨，由混頭起身，沿山路西行，經過之處，童山濯濯，植物甚少，兩旁山坡間，時見有人家居住，炊烟四起，住最高處者，幾近山峯，行十五里，抵三角坪，在此打尖，再前行，抵林口，已至飛越嶺山麓，高處積雪片片，氣候漸寒，飛越嶺高度爲拔海三六〇〇公尺，土人稱為烏鴉嶺，因嶺上棲鴉甚多故耳，顧名思義，險惡可知。山之高度，雖不及大相嶺，而坡度之陡峻，崎嶇之難行，似猶過之。由林口拾級而上，漸登漸高，怪石崢嶸，極難升爬，山間溝整雖深，而流勢並不若大相嶺山水之奔放。記者乘坐滑竿直上，僅行二三里，竿夫即力不勝任，乃下而着草鞋，持木校，於亂石徑中，偃僂而上，行抵伏龍寺，巳氣喘這巳，思及蜀道難，誠難於上靑天矣。至是坐石上休息，繼往寺前遊覽，知該寺建於元時，因年久失修，廟已圮廢，中間一神像，仰臥石襄上，兩旁坐偶，亦斷肢缺耳，殘敗不堪。旣而鼓勇前進，山徑益峻，成陡坡勢，記者因體較肥，攀登不易，此時汗流如注，襯衣盡濕，氣喘心跳，血脈緊張，幾量眩作嘔，同行者見狀，以勢將軍山，急囑休息，竿夫恐有意外，復舁之而上。時山頂老鴉啞啞，悲啼不止，似憐吾人之苦行者，憶古人咏烏鴉關詩云：「朝上烏鴉關，暮下烏鴉關，老鴉啼啞啞，行人還未還，」不管爲此嶺而作，乘滑竿僅行里許，竿夫因未過烟癮，力又不支，記者再下而步行，行三里許，始抵山巔，已精疲力竭，寸步難移，稍憇，縱目四望，雪霧雲天，彌漫無際，對面山峯，俱在白茫茫濃烟中，已無由識其眞面目，蓋此身已在白雲中矣。山頂有巡哨亭，武裝士兵四五人，正在亭內烤火，見記者至，注視不已，然並未究詰何來，亭旁有一小石龕，內有新成石像，不知何神，由此順下坡道下山，石徑濕滑頗不易行，記者甫上滑竿，行不半里，前面之一竿夫，忽滑跌倒地，記者再下而步行，行十五里，抵化林坪，時正下午三時，該鎭在山坡中，市面極蕭索，原擬在此住宿，同行衆人，僉主繼續趕路，於是復前行，人在應崖峭壁上，緣山徑而行，兩旁山勢連綿，中夾深堅，水流如雷鳴，行時時虞墜下，沿途人烟漸稀少，蓋已入瀘定縣境。下午五時半，抵興隆堡，乃止宿焉。</p>
<p>深入荒地</p>
<p>興隆堡屬瀘定縣管轄，爲山谷間一小集鎭，市面冷落，僅有飯舖及小客棧、鎭內有小學一所，學生不多，設備簡陋。在此住一宵，二十四日晨，離堡向西北行，是日陽光融和，溫暖如春，兩旁童山，逶迤荒烟衰草中，路上積沙甚厚，隨風飛揚，如在沙漠中旅行，蓋已深入蠻荒矣。進行問，迎面遇見苗家數人，趕載貨牲畜而來，隨後一人，口中喃喃不已，蓋康人信佛，行走坐臥，時誦經文。記者所僱之滑竿夫，曾數度出關，略諳康語，連聲謂「哈莫果」，並向之嬉笑，「哈莫果」者，漢語不懂之意也。再前行，連爬過幾段陡坡山道，瞥見山間，溝堅漸闊，而水流湍急，似成河形，詢之竿夫，知係大渡河下游，轉過山坳，見雙峰間有瀑布倒瀉，始悟水急之故，行十里，抵冷磧，市面整潔，街道係石灰和桐油敷築，頗似柏油路，市內有小學，貼抗戰標語甚多，在此打尖。聞去年秋，該鎮被一塲火災房舍焚燬十之三，現正積極建造，不久可恢復原狀。由此前進，山路高高下下，曲曲折折，並崎嶇難行，遙望高峯，揷入雲端，氣勢甚險峻，山F阡陌相接，青綠成片，與山上之荒草相襯，頗有霄壤之別，路旁仙人掌甚多，枝粗葉厚，與內地園圃者所植者逈異。行至危岩下，見巨石刻有神像，負貨土人，正焚香膜拜。十二時，抵瀘定縣，遙望山麓，有洋房一座，似爲教堂建築物，人東門，上有「無殊天府」四大字。入城內，一片荒凉，石礫滿路，至橋東街休息，並進午餐，餐畢，往參觀鐵索橋。</p>
<p>過鐵索橋</p>
<p>瀘定位於康定東南，踞大渡河上為入康要道，淸康熙四十年，番人叛變，淸軍南片，討平打箭鑪後，就河上建瀘定橋，兩端鐵索，植於巨岩上，攔柱均以鐵爲之，長凡州丈廣九尺，索計九條，覆板其上以濟行入，橋側有康熙時所立碑記，文爲清聖祖作。敘平番建橋之事甚詳。每三年由西康政府派員培修，此碑至今猶存，橋東有新立之碑記、上刻劉文輝主席題古瀘定橋四大字，瀘定關即設此，置有柵欄，專人司啟閉。記者往參觀時，見此橋横跨河上彷彿長虹一條，上聳危崖，下臨深澗，水流湍急，怒翻雪浪。記者鑒於前日過榮經之鐵索橋，幾爲暈倒，渡時囑由滑竿夫扶之而行，而索軟曳盪，依然搖擺，俯視狂瀾，心頗懷然。步至西端，同行者向余逆目而笑，向例此橋三年一小修，五年一大修，聞數年前某軍入康，因士兵爭渡，索被壓斷，溺斃多人，近年當局對於渡橋特加限制，凡牛馬及笨重貨物，一律禁止通過，祇准人行。記者等渡渦鐵索橋後，見橋北河中，有木船一，正在載渡牲畜，時傍山坡西行，坡度忽陡忽慢，行時忽緩忽疾，瞥見山坳中，濃烟冒曳，延燃枯草，蓋人放野火也。經過咱里時斜陽一抹，餘暉照疏林，旣而亂山暝合，益覺荒凉，舉目西望，凉月一鈎，仰掛山巔，憶及蘇子瞻之山高月小水落石出兩名句，覺此情此景，依稀似之，行抵烹塌，已至黄昏時候矣，晚即宿此。</p>
<h3>値得重視之　浙省造紙工業（三）　當局亟應投資獎進　革除陳法切實改良　浙東旅行通訊</h3>
<p>記者所經各地農村，均見有造紙之槽戶，每縣有數十戶或百餘戶不等，但設備皆極簡陋，這種紙槽，大都設於山溪之旁，藉着水力推動木製的轉輪，來推移木樁以槌碎竹肉，而從事製造，沿途所見皆爲婦女及兒童在司此資。</p>
<p>原紙原料</p>
<p>造紙為浙東主要的手工業，故記者對之詳細考察，浙東所產紙張名目繁多，如南屛·花箋·元書·鹿鳴·方高·海放·京放·等數十種，但大別可爲四類，（一）黄白紙類，（二）黄燒紙類，（三）草紙類，（四）皮紙類。黄白紙大都供書寫之用，燒紙爲供迷信之用，皮紙類爲供傘包札及雜用。各種紙張，其製法亦各不同，但一般的程序是先由糟戶僱工，將纖維細柔之新竹砍下，曳之下山，鋸斷爲二尺至五寸之短竿，將竹青（卽表皮）與內肉分開，丟竹肉纖維細長，宜掣白紙，竹靑則質料粗脆，留爲作黄紙之用。竹經分段及削靑，就把它搥碎。道工作，故由婦孺爲之，竹料搥碎後，就在日中晒乾，復浸入水槽，時間的久長，視竹料的老嫩而决定。經六七天後，將石灰漿混和竹料漿醃，這種漿醃的方式，是把石灰與竹料二者堆積在一起，大約一月後可醃熟。於是蒸着，平常五天可熟，蒸後便置入溪中洗去灰質，放置在爛料塘內，再經十天，始能軟爛而成爲熟料。原料成後，復藉水力春成細料，貯之料桶內，以供製造。製紙時便將細料注入紙槽，和以植物膠及少許水份，以竹桿打攪，俟其勻純後，即以紙簾置入，運用手工以抄成一頁頁的紙片，平放於底版上，榨去水份，入室烘煏便成。</p>
<p>應求改良</p>
<p>中國今日處於戰時狀態，加强全國人民之經濟總生產量，實爲常前要務，業，以獲大量之生產，固屬重要，但提倡手工業生產，以其能率言之，相等於大企業。故吾人對今日浙東重要手工業生產之造紙，實亦足注意也。蓋浙東各地每年產紙，爲數殊巨，且大部對外省輸出，但由於下列的幾點原因，不能充分的發展：（一）產紙大部爲供迷信之用。（二）槽戶均爲農餘假婦孺之手爲之，故墨守舊法，不知改良。（三）丟各槽戶之取料不一，製法各異，致出品不能標準而精良。（四）無充份的資金，故工具簡陋，不能大量生產。依記者之觀察，設今日之浙東造紙，能加以整理而改善，則對吾國實有莫大利益。欲圖其改善，最佳的方法，首當嚴厲禁止迷信紙之製造，地方政府當負責指導各槽戶改善工具設備及統一並改良製造方法，以使出品能標準精良。並當局應積極籌集資金，貸款與各槽戶，以擴大及改善其一切設施，而使充份的利用此天然的原料，及農餘的勞動力，而求質量之加增，以適應當今的需要。</p>
<p>今日在西安·及四川等地，有採用土紙以替代新聞紙印刷報紙，以减國家資金之外溢，這確實是個可喜現象。若士紙在今日能够改良出品，使其能適用於印刷，那麽每年可减少巨額的資金外溢，這一個帮助，對之戰事中的經濟，實有莫大的裨益。</p>

<p>上海敎育界</p>
<h3>改革敎育意見　關於國語科改革的諸問題（三）</h3>
<p>— 揚晋豪</p>
<p>（三）對於教村中的文法·修辭．章句結構、表現方法等、要詳於研討盡可能以古文和今文相比較、以文章和口語相比皎、以中題相同而文體不同的文章相比較、以同類性質而寫法不同的文章相比較、同時、要教導學習對於名言嘉句、旁加密圈密點以養成其審別鑑賞的能力、教導學者在每段的書眉和文末（或另用扎記簿）、以極少的短句、簡括要義抒寫感想、以養成其思考能力、此外、對於典型的人物和事件、要隨時分解、譬如楚辭中的「漁父」、是寫着三種人物、一是又醉又濁的舉世衆人、一是不肯同流合污的屈原，一是隨時投機取巧的漁父、這和魯迅的「聰明人和傻子和奴才」以及他在「半夏小集」第四節中所論明亡後的漢奸、逸民和烈士，雖然寫法不同、但其寫三種典型人物的形象或性格是一樣的、在教讀時不但要把這三篇文字的表現技術、加以比較研究、並且要把那三種典型人物、加以分析批判、其後又可教讀廚川白村的「獃子」、那是和一烈士」「傻子」「屈原」同一類型的正義的人物、從而來鼓動學者的憑藉眞理、認眞勇敢、爲民族國家、社會民衆謀福利的精神、現在冉來談一下關於學者的寫作練習等方面的問題、</p>
<p>（四）作文、普通是初中每週一次或三週二次、高中二週一次、我以爲與其多作、不如多讀、因爲學者文筆拙劣、多作之後、一經成爲習慣、反而有害無益、所以初中作文、亦可規定二週一次、別一週的作文時間可用討論、改句·背誦·默書等來代替、作文題目、應在學者的經騐和認識以內、作文批改、應多加記號和眉批、總評必須切實、不着邊際的老奪評語、是不必要的、在每學期中、可以提出數次作文、只批不改、發還學者自行改正、於謄淸後再繳敎師詳加批改、自更容易進步、發卷時的個別指點、也很重要、這可使學者更注意和瞭解其寫作缺點和修改的方法、在後次作文時格外仔細、至於同學們所常犯的錯誤、則應在發卷後公開提出討論和指正、有些國語教師、把作文請他人批改、這是不合敎學原則的、</p>
<p>（五）讀書扎記、可規定每月繳卷一次、對於課內教材和課外閱讀並重、那目的不但在使學者多識些生字多懂些難句、多讀些好書、並且也在訓練學者思想組織、論理推演、和慣於寫作所、以在扎記中、除掉註釋生字難句、記錄名言佳句等外、還須摘出那文章或書籍的綱領大意和讀後感想等才好、</p>
<p>（六）週記、大都是用那印就項目格式的本子的、這實在是太呆板了、有時學者要記述的事件很多、但因篇幅有限以致寫得很侷促、或則就草率從事、有時學者無話可說、但因項目印就、不能不點綴一下、以致成了虛僞敷衍、所以、週記簿以不印就項目格式的好、不過在書前可以印上些週記耍項和作法等、以提醒學者、共實週記一項、不如改爲生活日記、每月底寫一次總檢查後、繳給教師批閱、似乎更要合理些、切實些、</p>
<p>（七）以上各項成績、凡是擾良的、擇時公佈、以供公衆的模仿參考、和引起同學間的學業競進心、其他的課外作業——如出版壁報·印刷品、和作文競賽等、自當多多予以鼓勵、指導和舉行、此外、我認爲每級應有一小時週會時問、由國語教師指導學者開會討論演說、辯論等事宜、以融洽同學間的相互感情、訓練同學們以公民知能、增進同學們的學術思想、尤其是發展同學們的講話口才、是與語文有密切關係的、</p>
<p>（八）最後、國語考試（作文除外）不可儘出些機械式的題目—如默書·解釋·翻譯·塡字·正誤等、這是很容易賽成學者死讀書的習慣的、應該特別着重那靈活一點的題目—如述某課大意及感想、從一整個單元中提出問題等、以迫使學者對於所讀的教材不能不去刻苦解索、以求融會貫通、我在懷久高中教了「圓圓傳」……後、於考試時出了這樣一個題目、「讀……後、簡述明來形勢並試與吾國今日之抗戰、比較其異同、」像這題目、死讀書者是决做不出的、我的目的、便在要學者活讀書、同時要密切注意現實、</p>
<p>（九）至於書法、本由國語教師負責指導的、不過、到了今日、普通書寫只要字跡明白淸楚就行、若要眞眞考究書法的秀勁風格、那是成了一種藝術了、在一般新進的國語教師、恐怕未必熟知各體法書、尤其未必能因學者的筆跡而認識其個性、以指點他們臨摹某一種的碑帖、所以、我認爲今後的書法、應另聘專家、總司指導之責爲妙、</p>
<p>四·教師的任務進修和待遇　　（一）因爲國語科對於學者的影響最繁複、又因爲國語教師對於學者的認識最深切、所以國語教師不但應該、並且也最便於兼顧語文技術和思想理知品性、行爲等諸方面、來訓練學者、因而所負的任務也最重大、</p>
<p>（二）國語教師除須精究語文·文學史·文藝思想和寫作技術等外、還當熟悉歷史背景和現實形勢、至於共他的常識、亦須博大、所以他們必須天天看報、遍閱重要的文藝期刋和名著、對於一般性的雜誌和書籍、也當擇擾翻閱、自己的品性行爲、更得注意修養、使成爲學者的表率、每月至少應該召開一次全校國語教師會議、以交換教授經騐、討論改進方法等等、</p>
<p>（三）國語教師所起的訓育影響、事實上是比訓育主任還要大而深、所以應明令規定他們須兼級任導師、同時、國語教師比其他各科教師所費的預備功夫和改卷時問爲多、所以除正薪以外、應該另加作文改卷費、使他們更樂於盡職、近年來物價高漲、即一般學校對於教師的待遇反而减小、教師們爲了迫於生活、一定會分心他事、這結果是减低了教學效率、實不能不立即改正、教書原是清苦的事業、但也要顧到教師的生活能够維持才行、尤其是兼職不能太多的國語教師（我認爲每個國語教師以教兩班國語爲準、才能克盡其職）、待遇應當提高、</p>
<p>有些人因為把國語科的範圍看得太狹、甚至把國語科的地位看得太輕、以致使國語科對於學者不能盡量收到多方面的應有效果、這是非常可憾的、我們今後、應當把國語科看做訓練學者成爲新中國公民的最基本的教程、而加以特別的注意和改革才是、（完）</p>

<h3>抗戰中的上海金融</h3>
<p>— 錢致平</p>
<p>（一）前言</p>
<p>從民國二十五年底到『七七』抗戰發生爲止，可說是中國經濟最盛期，由法幣政策的實施，及國內一般經濟的向榮，這時期金融業的發展，可說是前所未有。新企業紛紛設立，內外債市一致漲到八扣九扣。蘆溝橋的砲火，就在這時爆發。這次抗戰，性質空前。上海一向握全國金融樞紐，所受影響，也可說是空前。說也希怪，中國的金融機構，本來說不上健全，但每逢一次事變，輒能應付裕如，化險爲夷。就已往所發生過的來說，如「九一八」，「一二八」，「閩變」，「白銀出口問題」等當然，拿這次抗戰來和以前比較，性質上不知要嚴羣到多少倍。「七七」發生在華北，一時尙未感十分嚴重。「八一三」發生，適逢星期五，接後兩天是上海銀錢業休業。八月十六日復業，同時政府頒布安定金融條例，限制提存不得超過百分之五，一方面防止資金逃避，一方面用以維持金融業。此外還有最重要的是上海四行貼放委員會的辦理貼放和銀行準備委員會的辦理拆放。二者性質差不多，不同的，是貼放條件較嚴，拆放條件較寬，有r貼放和拆放，正當的工商業活動，就不至於因缺少資金而停滯。這都是政府當局苦心孤詣和金融業方面縝密策劃的結果。當然，不楚說有了以上的應付辦法，金融業就可以完全沒有恐慌和損失，不過是把恐慌和損失，减少到不使金融業發生任何動搖的程度罷了！。</p>
<p>（二）抗戰中上海金融恐慌及其損失</p>
<p>這可分做三方面來講。金融業操百業命脈，抗戰發生，一般市塲均吿恐慌，余融業日難逃此範圍，固不待言。同時尙有關係到金融業的二件特別事：</p>
<p>A應付提存　戰初，一般存戶，基於心理作用，就安定金融辦法的可能範圍內，紛紛提存。銀行方面，當然不得不努力應付。戰前的半年間，本是中國經濟最繁榮的一個時期，各銀行存款額，據估計，較二十五年底，大都增加一〇％至二〇％以至三〇％不等。經此普遍提存，數目就大形减少。如拿各行已有報吿的二十五年底存款額和二十六年底的存款額比較，可見當時各行存款數目的减少。據上海商業銀行營業報吿，二十五年底，存款一萬五千三百七十九萬，二十六年底，存款减爲一萬二千九百二十一萬。又浙江興業銀行營業報吿，二十六年六月底，存款七千二百七十三萬，同年十二月底，减至五千六百三千五萬，就是明證。</p>
<p>B放款和投資損失　各銀行很多投資房地產的，處在淪陷區域，揖失尙無法統計。此外各銀行都執有公債，現在公債暗盤跌到法定價格以下，但這是非法的。銀行拿公債向四行抵押，仍照法定價格計算，所以談不到損失。至於放款一項，有信用放款與抵押放款之分，信用放款，一部份債務人他遷或死亡，無法收回。抵押放款，因抵押品在淪陷區損燬，損失更大。因此會發生一種奇特心理，認爲信用放款比抵押放款更爲可靠，因爲有債務人在，終可追討。抵押品的安全性反而不如。事實上抵押品雖已損燬，債務人仍不能解除清償資任，但這是法律問題，此處不去深討。我們祗就各銀行的放款與投資而言，因戰事而受到的損失，是不可否認的。</p>
<p>（三）畸形發展下之上海金融業</p>
<p>以上是二十六年底的情形。到了二十七年度，情形就發生了極大變化；這種變化，無寗說是基於政治的原因比較確切。國軍西撤後，上海由抗戰最前綫變爲比較安全的後方。及南京淪陷，戰局西移，一般富有階級，把上海認爲安樂窩，紛至沓來。跟他們同來的，是一批流動資金。抗戰初起時，大家惟恐法幣靠不住和銀行要動搖，紛紛購買外滙和窖藏現鈔；及後看到法幣，並未如何變化與動搖，法幣的對外對內購買力都能維持，因此一部份逃出的資金，又紛紛由外滙變爲法幣：窖藏在保險箱裹的現鈔，又一齊改存入銀行。這一個大變化，使上海金融業的存款，由退减而成爲急劇的增加。數目雖不易估計，但决非少數。</p>
<p>現在大家都嚷着「資金到內地」，上海這批游資，如果流到內地去，可以帮助開發西南，有益非淺。反過來說，如果停滯在上海，用之不得其當，直接間接上都將爲他人造機會，至爲有害。我們試對有害方面觀察一下。</p>
<p>（四）消費事業繁榮與投機勃興</p>
<p>自從上海變成孤島，人口迅速集中之後，消費事業，也跟着繁榮起來。無論是上中下各類消費事業，都是生意興隆，大發其「國難財」。這許多消費事業，可分爲三類：（一）原在租界區的，（二）由戰區遷移來的，（三）新創立的。但是他們都有同一的目標。加緊消耗中國恃爲命脈的外滙，維持上海在全國對外貿易上的原有地位。這種現象，實在言之痛心。普通說來，一地方的工商業繁榮與該地方的資金運用方針，大有關係。孤島裹的繁榮，雖然由其特殊的政治地位造成，但是充斥在上海的游資，未能加以正當的運用，却是莫可掩飾的眞相。</p>
<p>更不堪的是利用游資從事各種投機，助長許多金融風波：</p>
<p>當上海發生外滙暗市之初，是遠期責，近期賤；因此有大部份資金被利用去做套利交易。不久前，英美兩筆借款成立，外滙行市站穩，經營套利者無利可圖，於是轉過來做公債投機，最能具體表現投機勃興的，是目前上海小錢莊和銀公司的粉紛創立。這批小錢莊和銀公司的業務是滙劃貼現，外幣買賣，債券買賣等等。最近匯劃貼水的不住下降，很給小錢莊活動上一種打擊，至於他們當中，又可分做兩種。範圍較小的一種，資本有限，代客買賣，實際上等於便利資本逃避。範圍較大的一種，自身直接經營投機，所需活動資金極巨，業中人若與金融業有相當的關係，或可通融到巨額的放款。</p>
<p>再加房地產的投資，使租界區內「大興土木」。一部份租界區內戰後新興的小型工廠，他們原料的來路或出品的去路都有問題。這種投資，顯然都不合理。總括一句，集中在上海的游資，一部份已經發生了惡劣作用，這是當前的一個嚴重問題。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>「有錢的出錢，有力的出力」，在這個民族國家生死存亡的關頭，每一個國民都應拿出他最大的力量貢獻給國家。現在的西南，站在抗戰最前綫。西南的天然資源是非常豐富，最感缺少的就是開發的資金。但上海的金融業，竟讓充斥的游資，發生惡劣作用？當前的投機，終有一天會變成摧毀上海金融業的颶風。若不趕快調整目前運用游資的辦法，到將來誰都要追悔莫及，希望金融業當局迅速聯絡起來，共爲一個辦法。</p>

<p>四　戰時銀行業務的擴張</p>
<p>跟抗戰一年的經過，中國的銀行業業務動態，是有顯著的表現。這裏關於中央及特許銀行的，如三月十四日財政部公佈外匯請核辦法三條，購買外匯規則六條，四月四日有出口外匯的統制，先後公佈的有七種。同時，推行法幣入邊陲各省，例如雲南省所流通用的是滇票，可是在這一年來，因政府及特許銀行在滇省添設分支行，推進了法幣的普遍流通。</p>
<p>省市立銀行的戰事業務動態，（一）雲南省的外匯由富樓新銀行負責辦理，其統制辦法：（一）出口貨應照富行買進牌價結售外款；（二）出口貨物，可向富行抵押借款和辦理跟押或預備款項；（三）講辦合於軍事民生之該省的外貨必需品，具申請書經富行核准後，照賣出牌價供給外款。（二）輔幣的發行，江西省因輔幣的缺乏，由該省財政廳會同江西裕民·江西建設·和南昌市銀行，組織五分輔幣券發行保管委員會，發行五分輔幣券八十萬張，計値法幣四百萬元·其發行辦法，頗爲審愼，就是已往裕民建設，南昌市三行所已發的銅元票，限期按每吊二角八分（每吊値係財政部核准）收回作廢，而領用五分輔幣券的，要有確賞担保品，並須先經過省府之核准，規定用途，祗限收回銅兀票，平民公典，平民工廠，墾荒，農貨。而湖南省銀行也有五百萬輔幣的發行。（三）農村貸款的擴大，有福建省銀行與各縣政府合作，每縣款額，自萬餘元至數萬元，湖南省銀行廣東省銀行等，都有巨大款項的貸放。（見後）</p>

<h3>美國的原料貿易</h3>
<p>— E．Janeway作　朱基俊譯</p>
<p>在國際上有至深且鉅，足以支配未來的經濟是對美國原料供給的壟斷。一九三八年九月的歐洲危機已促使亞洲開始减她的全世界原料主要供給者的地位。因爲這危機的惡果已叻長了諸種勢力迫使世界原料貿易一變其昔日的面目。</p>
<p>遠東與亞洲東南部主要原料——絲，鎢，銻，橡膠，錫，鎂，錳等——的大主顧是美國，她所需要的佔總輸出的一半以上。因此，將來亞洲對世界市塲的輸出貿易將全賴美國的支持。此等原料運往西半球所必經的海道咽喉的能力。間接就是全賴於世界各國消弭戰禍的能力，對於亞洲的壟斷原料輸出，戰爭直是一個致命的打擊。</p>
<p>地中海的新危機使亞洲原料的主顧們深切感到這條交通路錢已不復是可靠的了。</p>
<p>日本奪佔廣州的目的是在使中國不能取得歐美的供給。這是日本制裁中國的一個方式；牠截斷了廣州後方與海外的交通。封鎖廣州的第二個作用當然是封鎖香港，同時更使日本得在地中海危機尖銳化而杜絕了另一條通路時切斷亞洲東南部與美國之間的貿易航路。一旦日本控制了新加坡與海外通商的孔道，則她簡直就切斷了南洋橡膠的出路。</p>
<p>這個情勢對於美國工業的重要性，美國當局早已覺察，所以她已準備了好多步驟以冀防止此種封鎖。各種錫工業——鋼，製罐，汽車和農具工業——已準備了一個應付緊急事變的方案。因爲錫的貿易是這樣的，礦錫都不是直接地運至美國而經過地中海在英國和荷蘭，鎔好了之後，再運到美國的。這樣，在英荷兩專鎔礦石的國家付出了一筆手續費之後，經大西洋運往美國的錫都不復是礦錫而已成爲鐵錫（猶如鐵鍚）了，以此鐵錫加以鍜鍊即可成爲錫版。</p>
<p>但美國錫的主顧門，對於地中海的朝不保暮的狀態也非常憂慮（因爲廣錫須經地中海而運往歐洲鎔錫廠，）不亞於對大戰之斷絕亞洲來源所懷抱的恐懼。所以他們爭先向產錫國家訂立購買合同，并與賣方約定於和平尙能維持和合同有效期間，儘速多多交貨。他們最困惱的是恐怕有一天供給者方面，會擔負不起巨量的定貨或楚生產量减低到百分之二十。</p>
<p>因此，他們又在計劃別一種長期保障和平的政策。第一個而且最迫切的計劃是限制錫屑輸出制度的確立，牠的成功已使本年度錫屑的輸出大爲减少。</p>
<p>第二個計劃是建設鎔錫廠（美國過去是沒有此種工廠的）。他們認爲依賴亞洲的危險很大，這使他們不得不排除依賴歐洲鎔錫的另1危險。尤有進者，他們談爲舊式而生產力薄弱的歐洲諸鎔錫廠，無論如何必需以現代的鎔錫廠去替代牠。</p>
<p>第三個計劃是在現行的美國外交政策中，增進一些新的旨趣。美國必須和玻利維亞訂立商約，約定玻國可由美國獲得她所必需的原料而以盡量供給美國以礦錫爲交換條件。最後，我們要來提一提美國用錫工業的現狀。他們在汽車工業中所進行的以其他金屬代替錫的計劃巳獲得巨大的成功；造成每輛汽車，現需錫二磅左右，過去所需的數量則爲七磅。汽車的生產一如製罐H業的生產，向爲美國的一大問題。但自積貯了巨量的定貨，並以玻利維亞爲其唯一的鍚之出品地之後，這個由亞洲的政治的和海軍的新情勢造成的問題巳獲得了解决。</p>
<p>至於其他原料，供給上也都有被截斷的危險，牠們可分爲兩類。一類是錳和銻，這兩種原料現在還都沒有相當的代替品並且必須由亞洲輸入（僅有一小部分可由古巴和巴西輸入）。以此，美國政府正在盡全力從事建設一個能够不靠國外的輸入而供給美國H業兩年之用的。『礦藏堆棧』。在這件工作上所費的經費約有一萬四千萬美元之鉅。</p>
<p>第二類則是各種代替品的原料。例如鋇可以代替鎢，而鉏的原料美國是很多的。此外，假如鎢的稅率或價格一旦提高了，美國還可以利用中國的鎢。至於絲，據說以杜帮廠新出的第六十六人造絲代替是最令人滿意的。牠的質地不僅適於民用同時亦能適於軍用，製造此種人造絲所必需條件祇是生產技術的熟練。橡膠方面的情形亦然如此，同時墨西哥和巴西也都是橡膠的生產國。總之，解决此等原料供給問題的方法，一方面是依賴於巨量的貯藏，一方面是力求綜合的生產技術之猛進。</p>

<h3>性衛生　德國對於腎虧症　用靑春腺素治療的成功</h3>
<p>由於科學家與生理學家的努力研究，始知人禮最重要腺器之青春腺，實爲改良人種與促進健康所必需，此青春腺若發生病熊，則生殖無力，故有遺精滑精，腎虧等症，以後對於生殖一端，陷於病態，民族健康，大受影響！</p>
<p>所以我可十足地說；青春腺的權威，不僅主宰個人的健康，實影饗及於整個民族，男子的青春腺，是包括睪丸全部，爲產生精液的重要機關，每一個男性無不需要由睪丸中分泌出來一種特殊物質，流到各部以促進身心的健康，與振作性機能，女性的靑春腺爲排卵的重要機構，如若失健，則月經不調，貧血不妊矣。</p>
<p>關於靑春腺不振後之悲慘遭遇，最近德國醫學家里滋曼博士與著名生理學家休爾補氏會發表兩件由於青春腺失健的驚人影響，他的記載是這樣：</p>
<p>一個廿歲的靑年，十六歲即犯自凟，旋罹神經衰弱症，並有遺精滑精，而性機能完全喪失，故屢次延宕婚約，其全身的一切，完全與童稚無異，體重祗八十八磅，腦弱不堪。</p>
<p>又一例是一個卅五歲的猶太人，因多妻斵傷，致患賢虧陰萎，夫婦間感情破裂，經醫師檢查後，證明其發揮性能的靑春腺喪失了作用所致。</p>
<p>這兩個病人，旋經德名醫orge　Foleg　M．D．博士投以德國靑春腺內分泌製劑男用「補體康」一星期後，即顯驚人效驗，蓋此時病者卽感覺頭腦爽適，所有失眠健忘等症象，完全消失，服之七星期後；體重各增四磅，發育漸良，與前判若兩人，三個月後，均先後恢復其性慾機能，一個乃如期舉行婚禮，一個亦不復再因喪失性力爲憂矣。</p>
<p>因此之故，德國「補體康』一藥，遂爲舉世學者所推崇，其女用者，有調經種子，補血駐顏之功，爲婦科聖藥。</p>
<h3>遺精上的上乘治法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭</p>
<p>處在都市的靑年，因風氣較鄕問爲開通，事事競向浮華，聲色玩好，應有盡有，青年爲惡環境所引誘，易於奪魄銷魂，潛志減性，犯上自凟，久而久之，腎部虧損，精關斵傷，遺精由是而生，所以都市靑年易患遺精的原因，即在於斯</p>
<p>講到遺精的通常治法，都側重於精神的，就是令患者嚴守攝生，清心寡慾，减少色情的刺戟，愼重飲食，力避過癆但此對於生理之遺精，頗有卓效，惟對自凟斵傷的遺精，除上述各種攝生法之外，則應積極服以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，以培補性力，然而再兼服性病專家耐而斯博士所發明的「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精，在睡前吞服三粒，當夜即可避免遺精，以余在臨床實騐上，屢具驚人治績，實爲一切遺精療法中的最上乘者，如體虧過甚，則兩藥同服，愈顯驚人功效。</p>
<h3>患白濁者應顧到婚後幸福</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　仲昌</p>
<p>凡是患淋病而久治不愈者，如其本人已經結婚的話，應該顧慮到此病極易傳染愛妻，而遭夫妻的反目，故患淋病而幸未結婚者，宜及時根治，以免他日在花燭之夜，即被良人發見自己之隱疾。遂致愛情方茁的根芽，枯落而死。惹起人生之悲劇，豈非自己不預爲之防之故乎？此外，淋病息者如在婚後依然未愈，則結婚之後，身體的抵抗力日薄，淋菌必肆無忌憚，故淋病患者，往往於婚後症狀轉趨劇烈，即是此因也。</p>
<p>因此吾人爲將來夫妻之幸福起見，不可不從速將此頑固之淋病，加以徹底治愈。惟在治療淋病時，切勿迷惑一般巨篇大幅之廣吿的成藥，蓋淋病療法之內服藥中，取其有實效而已，若迷惑此種意向與目的，吾恐終生必難遇到可以根治之內服藥也。余自美利堅攻習醫學返國以還，於淋病之治療，尤所研究。而德國淋病學博士所發明之「克淋儂」，更爲余歷年來所經騐，確證明較一般粗製濫造之成藥，效力超出萬倍。其特點有二：（一）服「克淋儂」後，能使體內各細胞發生抗淋噬菌作用，此種作用可以將藏匿深部如關節，血液之部分的淋菌，加以殲滅，故男女一切新舊白濁，均可治愈。因其具有此等效力，凡淋菌所在之處，「克淋儂」殺菌力亦即跟蹤發生，此等特殊功效，爲時下一般市上成藥所無。（二）「克淋儂」一藥，完全用科學方法提煉製成，故毫無副作用，與市上一般檀杳油及華澄茄所製而傷害胃腸消化力，及刺戟腎臟者，大相懸殊。故息淋病而祈求婚後幸福之保持者，非服用「克淋儂」决難保持之。</p>
<p>淋病講座</p>
<h3>白濁不愈原因安在？</h3>
<p>姚菊巖醫師述　診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>胸無主見易入岐途</p>
<p>諱疾忌醫，固然爲一般病息失治之主因，而胸無成見，不能判明何種療法，可以對本病有益無害，而貿然被一般誇大的巨型廣告所誘惑，不明事理，私行購服，以祈一逞，結果，往往適得其反。此蓋療法是否有效，是依淋病的症狀而定，不對症之淋病成藥，及其他療法，每見變症百出，淋毒內攻，更爲可怕，其實淋病患者，其初固非難治者，祗因患者，胸無成竹，誤被誇大之宣傳，濫服市上成藥，遂成慢性，且因此而妻子亦被傳染，使白帶增多。故一方雖獲治騐，然未幾又因房事之接觸而重發者。故尤爲難治耳。</p>
<p>務須恪守除淋務盡</p>
<p>然以余歷多年來之經騐，關於已結婚之男子，必須令其夫婦同時治療，始可根治，蓋非此不足以除淋務盡也。在療法方面，宜仔細推敲，如以電療方面，則德國最新發明之靜電療法，及X線療法，於肅淸淋菌之功效上，有想不到之偉效。若更內服淋病特效藥「克淋濃」，服之使其發生無遠勿屆，無微不至之殺菌力。所以任何難愈之淋病，只要應用此等療法，從無失敗之例。至於婦女淋毒性白帶，亦可服用「克淋濃」一方外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥。以淸除　道內之淋菌，無不指日吿痊。永杜輾轉再發之弊。</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起，每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角</p>
<h3>防癆與治癆</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺癆的成因，十分之九，都是起於慢性氣管支炎的。慢性氣管炎就是氣管由外來之刺激（如風寒等），引起咳嗽氣管內分泌增多，如果咳嗽持久不愈，必連帶肺部痛感。肺部本來是一具無知覺臟器，所以作痛者，乃因久咳傷及肋膜，致起炎症而來痛感。這種痛覺與其他不同。是像針刺一樣的。時有時無，或痛或隱，爲肺病第一期象微。宜趕快治療，否則就要發熱吐血了。最有效的治療方法，爲內服肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，此藥不特具有防止肺癆之功，且具充實全身細胞之偉力，初起咳嗽，服後即收鎭咳化痰治癆之功。</p>

<h3>各國收買華輪　全力擴充航權　日商企圖壟断中國航運對第三國船舶予以阻撓</h3>
<p>自日艦封鎖我沿海及長江下游後、國營及民營之輪船、被迫停航、華輪除充封鎖綫沉沒外、或為日軍奪刦、或為日機炸毀、所餘者悉數售與外商、蘇·美·葡·爺·挪·等國、均乘機擴充在華航業、侵我航權、日商亦企圖壟斷航運、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>華商各輪停航出售</p>

<p>外商擴充侵華航權</p>
<p>英·美·德·葡·希·巴·等輪商人、收買華商各輪船後、竭力擴充我國沿海及長江下游航綫、乘機侵奪我國航權、戰後新組織之外商倫船公司、如意商之中意·美商之衛利韓·華美·葡商之正德·美利·德商之遠東、此外德商禮和·魯麟·挪商華綸·等、均經營航業、今浙之寗波·台州·溫州、間之興化·泉州·福州、以及長江下游之滬崇海啟綫、滬通揚綫、曁南北洋各綫、均巳由外商各輪船公司派輪行駛、</p>
<p>日商企圖壟斷航運</p>
<p>日商日淸公司戰後經日本政府之津貼、統制江浙內河小輪、刦奪華商</p>
<p>新鴻興·崇明·天賜·等輪、改名獨霸滬崇滬通航綫、阻止開放長江、壟斷航運、經各國抗議無效、今欲壟斷我國航運、除新闢上海·厦門·航綫外、又計劃開航南洋班航綫、即上海厦門香港綫、關於北洋航綫滬靑連烟津綫、由大連汽船會社及日淸公司獨航、對於第三國船舶、予以種種阻撓、如無理扣留及檢查等、不勝枚舉、雖經第三國當局一再交涉、而日方依然如故、</p>
<p>扣留外輪妨害航業</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向航業界探悉、日方諉稱調查國籍、扣留第三國船舶、為希商亞生·葡商萬利·匈商愛大·英商永貞·巴商永達·葡商哈發·葡商海達·希商利物多·等輪、今除永貞·永達·哈發·海達·萬利、巳先後經各國領事抗議釋放外、亞生·愛大·利物多·三輪、迄未放行、此外並對鎖浙江海門之椒江、不准外商行駛滬阜航綫、一再妨害第三國在中國之航業、</p>

<p>大陸報云、昨（四日）悉、工部局警務處日捕部不久將臻充足之實力、警務處日籍人員、派定為二九六人、目前日捕人數則為二六七人、據宣稱、警務處某日籍助理警務長已奉令日內赴日本代募日捕三十名、星期五日晚工部局與日當局商得妥恊、結果警務處方面乃有此舉、按若干時日來、日捕實力、較派定者為低、因軍與後、江部局經濟拮据、故該部迄未臻足數也、</p>
<h3>中央恊助　各廠內遷　去年止計一三八家　遷川黔湘等省開工</h3>
<p>自中日戰事發生以後、日欲摧毀我民旅工業基礎、其所進攻地區、事前則儘量轟炸、俟淪陷後、則肆意奪取、我國當局、幸事先籌劃、凡有遷移可能者、皆分別設法早遷至安全地帶、並設立遷廠管理委員會、恊助各廠辦理遷移、至二十七年底截止、已遷移之重要工礦廠家及機器數量、分誌如下、　機器五金、六十四家、計四·四九四·八噸、　電器電料、十八家、計三·〇七一·一噸、　化學工業、二十二家、計三·一二四·三噸、　陶瓷玻璃、五家、計穴三二·〇噸、　文化印刷、十二家、計一·六七八·五噸、　紡織工業七家、計七·七八八·八噸、　造船業、四家、計一七二·八噸、　煤鑛業、二家、計三·六〇〇·〇噸、　其他工業、四家、計三五七·四噸、總計一百三十八家、二四·九一八·七噸、以上各廠、大多移至川黔及湘省西部、</p>
<h3>浙棉運滬　財部重予禁止　已備具證件者　仍准裝運出口</h3>
<p>財經兩部、前為防止國產物品資敵、故經規定土產五十四種、禁止運往淪陷區域、而上海亦被認為日方暴力控制區、故亦併予查禁、曾令浙海關遵照、旋經滬甬兩地商會曁各業紛電請求、當蒙核准棉·紙·蛋·竹·木·茶·等六種、允予通融裝滬、惟須由各該商會及同業公會負責證明、方准騐放、各業自接該項命令後、紛紛備具證明、將存甬綿花等、先後由謀福·德平·棠賽·美達·等各倫裝運來滬、茲據甬方消息、財部方面認為棉花係軍用原料、若無限制出口、難免流弊、故决重予禁止、至已備具證明文件而尚未運出者、仍予起運外、以後卽不得援例請求、已令由浙海關遵照辦理、</p>

<h3>中日戰爭中　遠東金融之前瞻（下篇）　匯豐銀行年會主席之演詞</h3>
<p>上海刦後漸轉繁榮</p>
<p>上海因環境關係、不能不對新局勢有所遷就、然自表面觀之、是年甚少改變、雖其唯一命脈之長江、經已截斷、但出入口貨物、在過去數月以來、較一九三八年初數月間、已有顯明之轉機、上海方面、在所謂安全區域內、居民數月、雖未必多於以前、居於公共租界法租界及華界者、但亦必不相上下、而上海工部局轄下之西區、工業之發展、極爲蓬勃、紡紗廠·絲織廠·造紙廠·均相繼在該區出現、此種發展狀况、使工部局及電燈煤汽等公司、有窮於應付之勢、蘇州河北日人統治之區域、則無足爲諸君告者、僅增加少數工廠、華人之重返其地者、不過數千、但就大體而言、此區域內之情形、實與年前無異、焚燒炸燬之戰區、仍未見有從新建設之象徵、上海公共租界當局、與日本駐滬海陸軍當局之談判、不幸尙無何種進展可言、余惟有複述去歲主席所言、即列强現在應協助工部局、以待種種問題之解决、</p>
<p>中國組織綫索堅强</p>
<p>凡自中國至日本之游客、對日本外表、似絕未受戰事影響必甚爲詫異、實則該國受戰事影響、日甚一日、日元價値、有一時稍高於中國法幣、有時僅與中國法幣相同、日本固係一有組織之國家、其政府之結構、極爲完善、在目下該國處境而言、吾人若認爲其持久力不足、則屬錯誤矣、該國之環境、將來是否有所改變、則須視其政治之進展情形而定、中國之渙散組織、與日本之有組織者、實絕對相遠、惟中國之組織綫素、甚爲堅强、此種優點、實出於意表之外者、中國人士、具有彈性特質、故不易斷之、兩國之經濟情形、吾等觀察、不宜過於側重此一方面、在現社會狀態之下、即歐洲對亞洲問題雖因預算表·國債貨幣流通·準備金統計·所顯現之反當狀態、亦無問之之權、雖最莊嚴之當局、亦每每對此種種問題、忖測錯誤、「滿洲」與日本之關係、則「年較一年密切、故對其他問題、余不欲更有所言、僅欲諸君注意其與德國成立之商約、此商約勢將奪取其他各國之買易、惟最引人注意者、即該國自美國購來貨物、價値較前此爲多、蓋大量講進軍用工業之原料也、</p>
<p>香港不受戰事威脅</p>
<p>香港爲一無稅口岸、外貨多經香港、轉運至中國內地、是年亦與往昔相同、貿易情形、閃縮不定、廣州之淪陷、與華南其他口岸之封鎖、其影饗於商業者固多、但尙未足以威脅一般商人、吾人其拭目以觀今年內之轉變爲如何可也、所幸香港之貨幣及金融情形、尙十分穩定、故吾等皆具有充份之自信心、以應付未來局勢、若菲島之貿易及金融狀况、一九三八年度、略遜於從前、惟對年來則極抱樂觀、蓋產金量及五金屬物品、皆呈起色、此對該島之經濟展望、甚有裨益、關於該島獨立之事、主張於一九四六年以前、脫離美國而獨立者、現因中日戰事關係、已改變其策略、至馬來亞羣島、則自一九三七年九月開始、其景况已現不景、一九三八年仍無進展、貿易數字、已證明是年之貿易狀况非佳、非各銀行之流資過剩、蓋馬來亞之繁榮、原賴樹膠與錫、自一九三八年間、此兩項出產皆吿低落、其平均價値亦低降、股份價格復陸續趨低、將來之命運、當與往昔無殊、此則視乎美國之需求如何以爲定也、</p>
<p>戰事延岩世界關切</p>
<p>若印度商業、則大呈退落、輸出業則更形慘跌、去年四月間、印度準備銀行降低其購入外匯率、外滙市塲、頓起顯著之轉變、其影響所及、使外匯市塲轉弱、自印政府表示强調之公佈、聲明維持羅比（印幣各）外匯價値後、始能阻止投機者對市塲之打擊、最後余謹對遠東情勢、再有所伸述、近數年來、中日間關係、由破裂以趨於戰事、不幸現在戰事、尙未有結束之象、其事態現正動蕩於危險之中、除非迅予試行調停、否則裂痕將愈不可縫合、在各國商人言、固甚願其戰事早日結束、但無慮千萬之力量掙扎之民衆、實認爲乃其存亡之問題也、此刻對現行整百整千方哩之被蹂躪情形、與乎於戰事未停止前、仍受苦難之戰地難衆、所受慘酷情形、未便加以詳述、吾祗望兩國之執政者、能將此種情形、牢記在心頭、對任何調停之機會、勿輕予放過、非徒解决一般遭難民衆、抑亦中日兩國間能由和平之道、而使兩國之商務、復趨於自然擴展、爲全世界所利賴也云云、</p>

<h3>毒斃養母審結　化驗藥罐解剖尸體並無罪證　女孩玉貞供認乃母下藥經過　莊氏供認被誣定十一日宣判</h3>

<h3>談談難民生產敎育</h3>
<p>— 零</p>
<p>有人說：「上海的難民眞享福，飽食終日，無所事事」！</p>
<p>這是「似是而非」的話，上海的難民，已有一部份參加生產工作。據最近的統計，上海難民參加各種小工藝工作的有六十一種，共一萬三千七百餘人。可見上海難民，並非坐食而不勞動。就是無工可做的人，請看，終日侷促收容所裏；所食僅能果腹，也談不到「享福」！</p>
<p>不過，目前難民生產工作，確有丙要提出討論的：</p>
<p>為沒有參加的機會，有的因爲缺乏工作的技能，所以全市十萬難民中，祇有一萬多人能生產能生活，這太不普遍了。</p>
<p>二·少系統的精密的計劃　照最近的統計六十一種小工藝，工作地點，有的在所外，有的在所內；工資數目，有的每天一元，有的每天祇三分。在生活管理，訓練各方面，均嫌缺少系統的精密的計劃。</p>
<p>我們在救濟機關服務的人，早有上面的感覺，想在最近期間，開辦難民工作訓練班，作整個的有計劃的推進難民生產教育。訓練班種類如下:</p>
<p>肥皂工業訓練班</p>
<p>化學工業訓練班</p>
<p>無綫電收發訓練班</p>
<p>搖襪工訓練班</p>
<p>籐編工訓練班</p>
<p>木工訓練班</p>
<p>外國刺繡訓練班</p>
<p>印刷工訓練班</p>
<p>汽車駕駛修理班</p>
<p>理髮業訓練班</p>
<p>鞋匠修理訓練班</p>
<p>無綫電裝置修理訓練班</p>
<p>編織工藝訓練班</p>
<p>水泥工訓練班</p>
<p>侍應訓練班</p>
<p>女傭訓練班</p>
<p>以上共十六種，所需經費，約計不過四千餘元，我們有了十萬元的經費，其他種種工作，均可逐漸計劃實施，使難胞人人有得到工作技能的機會。希望社會人士，竭力帮助救濟機關，使生產教育計劃全部實現。這樣，或可解决難民生產敎育問題，並可增進社會的福利。</p>
<h3>上海敎育界對於難民的責任</h3>
<p>— 孫曉樓</p>
<p>我國謨書人的傳統思想，每以閉戶讀書，養心修學，爲惟一的天職。所以辦理教育者，最忌是管閒事，鎮日與學生埋首案桌，讀死書，死讀書。一若書本以外無教育，學校以外無教育，以致養成許多四體不勤，五穀不分，祗有自己，沒有社會的消費分子。</p>
<p>自敎育革新以來，雖有七十餘年歷史，然而這種病態，依然還沒有完全消除。所謂普及教育民衆教育的呼聲，雖是鬧得甚　塵上，然而百分之八十的文盲，依然佔着世界各國的首位，這是誰的資任，這是我們辦理教育事業者大家的責任。</p>
<p>上海現有十萬餘難民，這十萬餘的難民中，可以說百分之九十是沒有生產技能的，百分之七十是沒有受過教育的，他們的家產毀盡了，他們的骨肉分散了，衣不足以禦寒，食不足以充饑，目不識之無，手無一技之長，他可以說是上海社會中最可憐的人羣。我們辦理敎育的，豈可再如從前的「閉戶敎書」渡着那優游自在的清閒生活，置這般苦痛愚昧的難胞於不顧。</p>
<p>或有人說：過去我於難民的給養上，曾應某慈善機關之請，巳盡了相當的責任。很好，捐款給養難民不能說是不重耍，然而消極的養，究不如積極的教。最近上海難民救濟協會教育組發起，難民生產教育的募捐運動，計籌十萬元的經費，教育十萬餘的難民，使其識字，使其習技，予難民以敎育的機會，敎難民有生產的技能，如此則以三四月的事功，必可達難民自食其力的目的，用以减輕社會的負担，增加國家的生產，實在是極有意義的一件事．我們站在敎育界的地位，應如何積極提倡，努力推進，期十萬經費的目標，早日達到，以完成難民生產敎育的大計劃。</p>
<h3>為勸募難民生產敎育經費吿各界書</h3>
<p>— 杜作舟</p>
<p>自前年「八一三」揭起戰事序幕後，各處靴民聚集於上海一處者，前後約有近百萬人之多。全賴上海各界人士，熱心救濟，踴躍輸將，分別組織難民收容所，盡量收容與安揷，這百餘萬的難民，始得衣食住間題之解决，而不至流離失所。至今巳十有九月，難民雖巳遺散了大部份，回籍的回藉，就業的就業；但目下尙留有十餘萬人左右。這十餘萬人，一方面固賴各界人士繼續慷慨捐募，另方面尤賴主持救濟工作諸先生熱忱將事，始得全部給養不成問題。不過這僅可說是治標的。長此以往，不特難以爲繼，且亦非根本解决難民間題的辦法。</p>
<p>現難民在各收容所中，飽暖終日，無所事事。倘不另想積極辦法，使彼等在這受人救濟期內，得能兼受一種教育，培養一種技能，以謀自己獨立生產，則將來必不免成爲遊惰之民。如是，愛之適足害之。不特他們自己將貽誤終身即國家社會亦將共受其弊。現在戰事何時可以了結，誰也不能知道。我們只知救濟，而不急謀使其能够獨立，則這種救濟工作，亦將永無止境。故爲難民計，爲社會國家計，以及爲各界人士自身的責任計，慷慨捐募經費，來實施難民生產教育，實是目前一種最迫切需要的工作。</p>
<p>因爲這個緣故，上海教育界及文化界的同志，最近在難民救濟協會教育組勸募委員會組織下，這來行推難民生產敎育經費的勸募運動。現在上海大中小學的教職員及舉生幾乎全體動員；至今才閱五日，業已募得經費十餘萬元，如此成續，實非常可以樂觀的。從這次勸募運動中，我們可見我國的民衆，均能明瞭他們的責任與義務，且均有實踐他們的責仟與義務的精神。有了這種精神，我們可以預卜我們的救國建國的工作亦必能如期完成的。惟這次勸慕的目標，原定二十萬元；現去目標尙遠，還望教育界與文化界同志繼續努力，各界人士繼續慷慨解囊，俾能於最近勸募期內，來完成這次具有重大意義的募捐運動。倘爲父母者，能勉勵其子女；爲師長者，能勉勵其學生；同時，各界互相宣傳，互相勸勉，則我想這二十萬元目標的達到。必定不難的。作者謹當爲十餘萬難民請願於各界之前也</p>
<p>總話說來，難飽同樣是中華民族的組成部份，他們和我門沒有罹難的同胞的生活是息得以延續，思想和技能有所進益，也就是我們民族的復興，更有把握，民族復興的目的可以達到，我們每一個黃帝子孫才能有獲得幸福生活的希望。因此，可以說救助難胞，也就是救助自己。</p>
<p>在這救助難胞就是救自己的認識之下，我們號稱為全國最富裕的上海同胞，首先應該本着有錢出錢的原則，慷慨解囊，來救濟本市十餘萬難胞，使他們獲得溫飽之外，並有受敎育與學習生產技能的機會。</p>
<h3>「沒有了家，沒有了爸。」</h3>
<p>— 黃鼎作</p>
<h3>救濟難胞就是救自己</h3>
<p>— 一鳴</p>
<p>目前上海所有的十餘萬難民，和普遍全國的千百萬難民，和我們非難民的中國人民一樣，同是黄帝的子孫，換句話，今日的難民，仍然是中華民族的同胞，對於自己同胞的困難處境，難道我們不應該開懷，不應該援助嗎？</p>
<p>固然，有許多同胞們，是時刻在關懷着難胞是正在盡力援助難胞。但是，有一部份同胞，却旣不關懷，更不予以援助。爲什麼會如此呢！因爲一部份同胞，對於難胞和自身的密切關係，並不十分的明瞭。因此，反映在行動上，才對救濟難胞的工作，漢不關心。</p>
<p>首先，我們應該了解，我們的國家，今日是處在最危險的關頭祗有四萬五千萬的黄帝子孫，不分男女老幼，不管貧富派別，如能一心一德，互相帮助，才能渡過這絕大的危機。根據這一個前提，我們來救助難胞，使他們能够溫飽，有受教育學技能的機會，也就是增加我們整個民族的力量。反之，許多難胞，因爲得不到濟助，或者飢寒而死，或者仍舊無知無識，不事生產，也就是斵傷了民挨的兀氣，减少了自己在應付國難時的許多帮手</p>
<p>其次，站在沒有淪爲難民的同胞們的私人利益上設想，和難胞也是有密切的關係。</p>
<p>因爲一國國民的富裕，必須整個的國民經濟發達，而國民經濟的發達，主要的是靠生產力的興盛，與消費量的衆多。現在全國的難民數達千萬，如果這樣廣大的難胞，由於得不到濟助，以致於死亡或墮落，那末對於民族的生產力必然削弱，消費量必然减少。在這整個國民經濟的凋敝狀况之下，無論什麼生產部門，與營業機關，都祗有日趨衰落的一途了。因此，爲着沒有淪爲難民的同胞的經濟生活的日見富裕和安適，也必須對自已的難胞，予以必需的援助。</p>

<h3>救救難民</h3>
<p>— 馮一先</p>
<p>孤島辦理救難工作，於焉已有一個多年頭，時至今日，我們當前的急事，還是離不了前項的任務！</p>
<p>一個社會集體的安全，基於份子生活的穩定與否，一般人生計有着，直接可以减少犯罪的行爲，間接奠定了社會安寗的基礎。現下孤島，有如許的難胞，如果沒有整個的救濟辦法，試問社會秩序能否安全，我們是否能够樂業？</p>
<p>「人之初，性本善。」所以凡是人類，必然具有偉大的同情性，我們眼見顚沛流離的難胞，無衣無食，痛苦萬狀，像這樣的遭遇，我們還忍心去袖手旁觀，不去發揮天賦性善的本能。</p>
<p>熱忱救國的，也熱心於救難，從事救難者，間接等於從事救國工作，所以不能救難者，就不配談救國。國事如是，我們就該磨厲以須，環境如是，我們該該救難民，以做救國的工作。</p>
<p>平心而論，孤島的人士。至少比一般無家無室的難胞好得多，一念之間，一手之舉，難胞就可得救。救難如救火，快些救救難民吧！</p>
<h3>為難胞永奠基礎</h3>
<p>— 孫育才</p>
<p>上海現在還有將近十萬個難民，這十萬個難民的給養，這十萬個難民的生活，完全是由難民救濟協會供給和維持的，難民救濟協會是由本市商界領袖虞洽卿先生所發起組織，現由他親任理事長，虞洽老熱心慈善，素爲國人所欽仰，所以辦理以來，成績卓著，爲難胞造福，功德不淺，他老先生年已古稀，還肯這樣的輸財輸力，眞使我們振奮和佩服，「惻隱之心人皆有之」，這是我們大家的事，誰都應該起來努力呀！</p>
<p>僅僅是維持難胞們的生活，這不是個積極的辦法，亦不是個治本的辦法，因爲俗話說得好：「坐吃山空」，人是不能坐吃的，一定要勞動和生產的，生產是人們應盡的義務，難胞們亦應各盡其力，共同生產，自無疑義的了，但如何來生產？，如何使生產效率大？種種問題，就需研究了。過去有許多收容所裏面，亦會辦過生產工作的事，可是成效不大，而且是零碎的部份的。協會方面，有見於此，所以便成立了教育組勸募委員會，公推教界領袖奚玉書陳鶴琴陳濟成等諸先生爲主任委員，並由本市大中小學校長，文化界巨子等爲常委，預備推動教育文化兩界的力量，完成一筆十萬元的難民生產教育基金，來解决難民生產問題，爲難胞們永奠基礎。</p>
<p>爲難民生產教育基金而勸募捐錢，這實在是我們教育界同人爲難胞們服務的機會到了，我們全上海的大中小學學生有幾十萬，教職員有近萬，十萬元的標的，是最低限度，我們一致希望超出五萬，成爲十五萬，將來款項的用途，已由會中徵求各界意見並擬縝密組織設計委員會，精密設計，務祈款不虛靡，成效大著。我們希望全市大中小補各級學校全市文化界同人一致起來，要做到沒有一個人不參加這次的總動員，這才是我們精神的表顯。同時還希望教界以外的人，亦多多隨願樂助，共成義舉，因爲這是自「八一三」以來，最有價値最富意義的一次募捐運動。</p>
<p>十日的預期快到，這是爲難胞們永奠基礎的唯一善舉，大衆一致起來努力與完成！</p>
<h3>敎育難民</h3>
<p>— 華志城</p>
<p>敎育之意義，乃爲助人類之發達，以適於世界進化之一作用也。使就當山之路謂之敎；使之自然長養謂之育。無貧賤富貴之疆域，更不容有難易之感念也。惟其教難，則更須敎；惟其育難，則更須育。若祇行敎於易者近者，固非吾人敎育之本旨也。</p>
<p>「國家興亡，匹夫有責」：其意義不僅在匹夫已矣？要視其負教育匹夫之資者之何以教之育之者也。教之當，則匹夫者，何嘗不能爲國家之柱石；敎之不當，雖非匹夫？亦難保其不爲竊爲盜，甚或爲國賊！</p>
<p>過去中國之敎育，姑不論其如何；所昭示於我人者，其間究有何種長處，可以歸功於旣往之敎育？其間究有何種弱點，乃爲旣往敎育所不得不任其咎？際茲抗戰時期，我人負敎育之責者，在自我良心上當如何去幹？惟一之急務，厥爲推行難民生產敎育。顧推行難民生產教育？良非易事；然我人責志所在，不許徬徨；所謂惟其敎難，則更須教；惟其育難，則更須育：所望一般人士，對於推行難民生產敎育，盡力資助；一方面使國家得以增高人力與物力；一方面使難民不致沾染惡劣，危害民族，此不僅我人良心上事耳。</p>

<h3>遵行政府法令</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>我們的所作所爲，自然以抗戰爲第一·除了直接的軍事行動以外，我們，尤其在遊擊區中，有助於抗戰的，勵行與敵人不合作，可以算得消極的工作，而遵行我們中央政府的法令，則可以算得積極的工作。</p>
<p>我們的中央政府，在領導着全國同胞，作着艱苦的鬥爭，以求國家與民族的獨立與自由，凡爲國民的，應該擁護之惟恐不及，而事事遂行着牠的法令，自然是不消說得的了。然而根據我們的耳目所接觸到的，却覺得還有些人，在這一點上，未曾有所努力，甚至辯髦法令，視若無覩</p>
<p>法院院長抗不交卸，騰笑中外，幸而補過於後，得以事成過去。省立學校校長的雙包案，屢見不一見，現在有否完全解决，恐怕尙在醖釀中。政府要我們將現金現銀獻出，而窖藏的也許正所謂比比皆是；政府統制外滙，而私買外匯的不知若干。……</p>
<p>這些事情，假使發生在與中央隔閡的遊擊區中，政府法令一時不能達到，情猶可原，而現在却就發生在法令依然到達，各種機關依然存在的「孤島」，這些人如果不屑做漢奸，不甘做亡國奴，那未，也就不能不說他們是在向漢奸與亡國奴的道上走！</p>
<p>在外侮這樣的壓迫之下，我們還有着我們自己所喜歡，所信任的政府，究竟不是容易的。我們假使願意牠安若泰山，却不肯遵行牠的法令，使牠有穩固的基礎，堅强的力量，豈不是南轅而北轍，自己和自己搗蛋！</p>
<p>至於在遊擊區中的，政府的法令固然有時不能直達，但一朝得悉之後，我以爲只有立即遵行牠們，才能解除在敵人鐵蹄下所受的痛苦。</p>
<p>我們在遊擊區中的同胞，在「孤島」上的同胞也在內，要與敵人不合作，我覺得並不困難；耍遵行我們中央政府的法令，更其不困難！我們爲什麼還要徘徊觀望，或者自尋煩惱不起來積極幹這與抗戰大有功效的盛事呢！</p>
<h3>客</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>經過了劇烈的大變動，一大半的城區都燒成平地，我的家徼倖還存在，大家瑟縮地住着。連天大雨，外面路上全是泥，有一個鬚髯如戟的男子，嘴裹念念有詞，在大雨裏來往走動，雨珠從長髮上滴下來，就像在河裹爬起來似的；形容憔悴，痴呆而奇突。我在門裏看了他很久，覺得可憐，向他招手。他眨着白眼向這邊望望，還自顧的來回地踱着，並不理睬。我們全家都把他當做話題，可亦猜不出一個所以然來。</p>
<p>到將夜，再向那邊望去，却不見了那個長長的影子。明天一早，東兒慌慌的跑來說：</p>
<p>「後門外池塘裏，一個人淹死了！」</p>
<p>神經麻木了的大人們，對於一個人的死，掀不起情感來；慢慢地跑到池旁，果見有個人躺在裏面，兩隻泥足還擱在灘上。我們設法把他弄了起來，分明是那個門口蹀　的怪客！我突然觸電似的一震。</p>
<p>報吿了區長，辦了手續，沒有人能認識這一位死者。大家的結論是：不是本地人。</p>
<p>這一個小小的波瀾，就也不了了之，隨着時光的過去，漸漸忘懷了。過了幾天，在區長那裏辦事的老張，跑來談天，拿給我一疊文件，說是那個淹死的怪人所寫，從衣袋裏檢出來。字寫得很勁，句子在可解不可解之間，老張說：「你看完了再說。」我一張一張往下看：—</p>
<p>你們說我是客，難道你們倒是主？</p>
<p>我雖然並非在這裏生長的，但這房子是我親手打樣，這花園是我親手佈置，這些花木，是我親手用池塘裏一勺一担的水來灌漑的。那裏是我的書齋，這牆上掛着我親手寫的對聯，上聯是：「但有玉人常照眼」，下聯是：「了無塵務纔經心J。這是王次回的句子，說給你們聽不懂，我就喜歡王次回的這二句。你們得想：玉人照眼，已是多麼大的福分，而况是常?我就有這福分。可惜，給你們道班混蛋們强兇霸道的打了進來，把我的玉人給趕到那裏去了；一家子東奔西散，連我也給攆走了。我在街上存不得身，跑回來，反給你們打出去，咳。臨着花園的一帶長廊，那柱上繫了不少馬，你們又不把料給牠們吃，餓得牠們拿我的廊柱儘啃，啃得不成個樣子。還有，我那屏風，上面有仇十洲的畫，給你們拆下來生火，只剩幾根光框子拋在園裏。我跑回來，你們又要打，又要殺；我說的話，你們不懂，你們的鬼話，我也莫明其妙。但是總得想：誰是主呀！</p>
<p>我在外面，餓得要命。熟人全死光了，遇見的全是些豺狼，睜大了眼要想吃我。天氣也可惡，連日大雨，淋得我滿身是水。咳，我不回來，難道呌我死在街上？可是你們父改了，那些猙獰可怕的强盜不見了，馬也沒有了，你們都套上了文縐縐的面具，長袍短褂的，在我門上掛起一塊什麼什麼辦事處的牌子。我跑進來，你們呌人把我攔到門房裹；當我是客，問我要見誰。我要見誰？我是主呀！你們硬呌我做客！</p>
<p>我說我是這裏的主人，你們都哈哈大笑起來，不讓我進去。從門房望進去，好像衣冠楚楚的人很多，還在揖讓雍容的談着笑着，眞是鬼影幢幢，眞是鬼影幢幢！</p>
<p>天下有這理？我自己蓋的房子，却不能自己住！由你們鬧得烏烟瘴氣，却把我當做客，攔在門房裹！不許我住，我只有死，我找不到親人；我沒有吃，我沒有衣服穿，我肚皮裏幾千卷書，不能拿出來換飯吃。</p>
<p>我就死在街上？我不甘心，我得死到家裹來！我要在我自己經營的花園裏死，我要沉在我自己的池塘裹。我就算吃了你們的虧，我强不過你們，我死了也不能饒你們。你們得想：到底誰是主，誰是客?</p>
<p>從前有豪家的子弟，把祖宗遺下來的屋子，一塲賭，輸光了。自己流落在外，有家歸不得。咳，我從不愛賭，我在什麽時候把這屋子輸與你們？</p>
<p>我滿腹疑問，你們不肯給我解答。我死了，你們看我的眼睛也睜得大大的……</p>
<p>我讀完了，說不出什麽，頭低了好一會；老張也不響。我偷偷地向他望望，見他正睜大了眼在望我。</p>
<h3>春色惱人</h3>
<p>— 吳澐作</p>
<h3>奔</h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>像鳥兒飛出了樊籠一樣，我毫沒有留戀的離開了家。</p>
<p>那幽沈的小院裏曾消磨了我整整二十年的生命，像一隻被拘制的鳥兒！不，像一個被判徒刑的罪犯，我享不到自由的樂趣。</p>
<p>我幾番要想衝出那道灰色的圍牆。</p>
<p>可是，我還未長成能高飛的翅膀啊！慈母的限淚又把我　留在狹箱中。</p>
<p>一年又是一年，整整的二十個年頭了呀！我的高度已經超過那道灰色的圍牆；我雙手的氣力也可以推坍了這所朽舊的屋子。</p>
<p>在這時候起，我的胸腔內更添了一顆躍動不息的心！</p>
<p>終於，有一夜，我偷偷地爬過那道圍牆，沒有憐惜的離開了那相處二十年的舊居。慈母的眼淚已經繫不牢兒子那顆長成了的心！我不願冉將以後的生命虛費在這狹小的籠子裏，我要創造自由的新天地！</p>
<p>此刻，我正在路上奔着：像一隻脫出樊籠的鳥，决不戀念那道灰色圍牆環繞着的家！</p>
<h3>再談「不看書」</h3>
<p>— 岉</p>
<p>五年以前的一天，我偶然遇着同鄉王××君，那時他剛巧辭去故鄕縣政府某職，預備委身於社會事業。他說：「我現在計劃半天辦公，半天看書。幾年以來，我所積貯的一切知識，在服務期中的繼續耗費，差不多已經用罄，而且陳舊了。我若再不看書，我還能避免落伍的厄運麽？所以，無論如何，我現在總該多看幾本書來充實我這個空虛的頭腦」於是他接着要求我介紹幾本書給他看。</p>
<p>他已經五十歲以上的人了，其實，他不但有廣博的學識，而且有着豐富的經騐；他的好學不倦的精神，眞是値得靑年人的欽佩與摹倣的！他時常說：服務社會的人最懼怕知識的飢荒，因爲飢荒的結果，往往會引起不能容忍的獨斷的盲目的自誇；古人常言道：「仕而優則學，學而優則仕。」我們該準確地明白它的指示。</p>
<p>歐美人的動學和重視他人的意見，是我們熟聞的！因爲他們覺得除了學習以外，再沒有另外的促使進步的方法。他們在政府中服務，或者在退隱期中，對於公衆的工作，和學習都是一樣熱心。不說別的，就是六十歲以上卸任的部長在大學裏聽演講，或者詢問難題也是常有的事。假使以王××君和他們來比擬，那末，王君還可以說是年輕力壯呢！這個也許就是王君時常看書以帮助他發展事業的理由吧！</p>
<p>現今有一班青年實在成功得太快，而且太容易滿足了。會幾何時他們榮任要職，而且負起重責來。我想他們似乎太幸運了。恕我說得直率，他們貧瘠的學識和不充足的不訓練，面着困難臨前，可就束手無策了。不但如此，他們大都自信自己的學識，足够勝任一切，以爲他們何用再看書呢？這個觀念就是限制他們將來進步的致命傷！</p>
<p>我屢次以「落伍」來警吿自己！無論怎樣忙碌，我每天祇少也得安排一小時或者兩小時看書的時間。無疑的即使是十五分鐘或者三十分鐘的看書也是很有利益的！我們可以採用胡適博士利用每一短時間來繼續地閱竟一部書的方法。假使每天能看三千字，那麽一個月就能看九萬字了。這個工作是非常輕鬆的，即使是年逾古稀的人也能辦得到！我們可以在不知不覺中養成每天看書的習慣。青年人，就在今天開始吧，讓我們個個人都有這個看書的嗜好。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>兩邊都鈎心鬬角的佈置好了。不過獨眠李那邊的佈置，葉團長却不得而知的，他甚至還以為獨眼李接了請帖，不見得敢來赴宴。誰知第二天居然接到了獨眼李的回覆，說是「謹如尊命」，這倒很出葉團長意外，他覺得獨眼李的膽子委實不小。恰好步哨當天又獲住了兩個形跡可疑的人，葉團長親自鞫問之下，情知他們都是獨眼李派來的細作。但不便說破，假意斥責了兩句，便把他們放了，進來對梁團附說：</p>
<p>『我看這事情很有些棘手。獨眼李這傢伙不是好對付的，他人還沒有到，已經派奸細混到這里來打聽消息了。我本來不難殺一儆百的重辦他們一下，不過打草驚蛇，反爲不美，所以把他們放了。現在我們必須重新精密佈置一下，以免萬一有失，縱虎歸山，反貽後患。』</p>
<p>梁團附把手扶着頭，沉思了一會說：</p>
<p>『團長把他們派來的奸細放了很好。不過我有一件事擔心，現在他們已經道樣，到了約定的那天，一定更要多派人來，說不定還要帶傢伙。那時如若置之不理，倒給他多添了羽翼，要剪除他的羽翼，叉恐他不來上鈞，那可怎麽辦？』</p>
<p>『所以我們要精密佈置一下，第一不讓他逃出這座門，第二不讓他逃出合浦鎭。』</p>
<p>說到這里，葉團長便放低了聲音，把他臨時想到的計劃，向梁團附附耳說了了一遍，梁團附不住點頭道好。</p>
<p>約定的宴會日期到了，因爲葉團長事前嚴禁洩漏消息，所以這天鎭上的空氣仍和平時一樣，只有鄕公所的內部特別緊張。葉團長在鄕公所裏面精密佈置了三道埋伏：第一道在大廳的屏門背後，第二道在大廳的左右廂房裹，第三道則在儀門口的左右耳房裏，每一道埋伏都配置十名左右勇敢的親兵。至於外面的佈置，更是嚴密，對那些形跡可疑的人，雖呌部隊小要干涉他們，但却必須嚴厲監視他們的行動。（二五）</p>

<h3>大阪火藥庫的爆炸</h3>
<p>— （戈兒）</p>
<p>大阪枚田地方的日本陸軍火藥庫爆炸了！這並不是如東京所傳的電訊，說是什麽「頭係搬運火藥不愼所致。」這是日本有正義感的人們，就是被日本京都的警視廳認作所謂「日奸」的人們，對自國法西軍閥的一種堅確頑强的答覆！</p>
<p>在日本法西軍閥侵華的二十個月中，我們看到不知多少發生在日本軍隊中的悲劇，厭戰思想的普遍增高，是眞所謂與日俱增，如日前報載：「華北日軍總司令部，最近會將駐防北平，天津等地，及派赴山西，河北，察哈爾，綏遠，山東各處與游擊隊作戰之日軍，作全部之思想測騐，一觀其對於中日戰爭之態度，結果，日軍表示厭戰者，佔百分之三十八，其中多數士兵，皆覺長此作戰下去，必將毫無所獲，故多希望早回日本，從事和平時代之生活，」就是一個很好的例子。其他有朝鮮台灣等殖民地的普遍反戰，和東京帝國大學因自由派經濟學教授河合榮治郎的被捕，引起大批教授的「自動辭職，」以及曾在華指揮作戰的日本大將忽然「削髮爲僧」了，還有上月十七日日本關東南部町與大坪，因徵兵發生的激烈暴動，這些一切，眞是舉不勝舉！而這些一切，也正是蘊蓄在他們心窩中的「火藥庫」的爆炸！這種蘊蓄在他們心窩中的「火藥庫」的爆炸，今日已引起了大阪枚田地方陸軍火藥庫的爆炸，而明日是一定會引起所有日本的火藥庫的爆炸是無疑的！</p>
<p>然而最最主要的，而也絕不能忽略的，我們一定要明白；大阪枚田地方的陸軍火藥庫的爆炸，可說是我們中國持久抗戰所發射過去的一顆偉大的無聲的炸彈！就是說：只有我們依照偉大的領袖蔣委員長所昭示我們的「不中途妥協」而持久抗戰下去，日本法西軍閥是會在我們的堅强抗戰下，以及由我們堅强的持久抗戰所引起的日本所有火藥庫的爆炸之下而崩潰的！</p>
<p>我們要持久抗戰下去，不中途妥協，我們將會看到日本更大的軍用火藥庫的爆炸！</p>
<h3>影師救駕</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“ShalpsLo　ters”</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯出品大上海戲院映</p>
<p>「影師救駕」是叙述一位新聞攝影師怎樣勇敢的去拯救瑪達凡尼亞國的幼主，及擒獲了陰謀篡國的叛臣。更以汽車疾馳，飛機救險，及羣衆塲面的穿挿，自然還有一段不可或缺的羅曼史，在演出上成了一部所謂「緊張滑稽片」。</p>
<p>但是導演者却是側重在「緊張滑稽」部份的，如攝影師史迪夫在飛機上攝取親王的飛行術；史迪夫趕赴飛機時的機器脚踏車的横衝直撞；史迪夫被誤認刺客時的脫險；親王駕飛機掃射；黛安妮被禁；儲君脫逃；及最後民衆的狂呼，史迪夫的救護親王；這些連續的刺激，驚險塲面，在看的的時候是頗爲「奮興」的；但這正患了一切滑稽片的同病，這些塲面是以「巧合」來聯貫起來的。不過最後沒有大團圓，那是最聰明的地方了。</p>
<p>但「影師救駕」却無意的給了我們一個啟示，陰謀篡國的不祇是奧爾洛夫子爵，史迪夫和黛安妮信任的馬帝姆侯爵反是「正兇」。所以，一切陰謀在沒有敗露以前，是不會看出那些「陰謀者」的面目的，而在陰謀敗露以後，一定要肅清殘餘，以免留着禍種而有再次的陰謀出現。同時它更指出民衆的力量才是最大的力量。</p>
<h3>吃金飯碗的人　銀行職員的生活</h3>
<p>— 銀行員</p>
<p>（三）日常生活和工作</p>
<p>日常的工作是刻板的。從上午九時起到下午四五時止，終天離不了鋼筆和算盤，「製傳票」「對印鑑」「登帳」以及「編造各種表報」是每天的經常工作；看起來像很容易，事實上也得「細心應付」尤其是在營業科工作的，更是要「小心翼翼」，因爲營業科是銀行的最前錢，站在最前綫工作者，代表銀行直接與顧客發生關係，一有錯誤或發生衝突，最容易使顧客產生「惡劣的印象」，連帶的便影響到銀行的業務和前途，因爲銀行是需要顧客的，更多的顧客的，沒有顧客，事實上銀行就不能存在，假使營業科的辦事人員，種種方面，對顧客有不到的地方或是不能諒解合作的話，銀行的前途便要在動搖之中，這是經理主任們最不放心的，最不願意的。所以，他們是週旋於銀行經理跟顧客夕間的，應付上需要「面面俱到」，旣不能亢，又不能卑，隨時要使每個顧客都能滿意，同時史須得到經理的愛悅，所以銀行的經理主任對於營業科的辦事人員，不論是「品性的謙和」「技術的敏捷」都是特別加以留意的。再有一點；就是常忙起來的時候，他們是連吃中飯的時間也沒有的，過下午一點鐘是常有的事。個中苦况的確不是局外人所想像得到的。</p>
<p>在會計科工作者，比較上閒一些；他們是擔任着覆核工作的，大都是今天覆核昨天營業科所做的工作。還有稽核部則是考核全行的各種表報，統計全行的帳務，其職司在會計科之上。此外屬於內部總務方面的有交書人事庶務等科，當這一種工作的人不一定是出身金融界的，他們的工作看起來也比較清閒，不渦「派頭」是耍比在其他各部辦事的大一些，　認都具有相當的「身價」，尤其是人事科的主　　他是管理全行人事的，全行行員的獎懲升訽都操在他一個人手裏。</p>
<p>每天辦公一過便是他們活躍的時候。這時候收入豐的，那末行則摩托卡，食則西餐，跳舞廳等娛樂塲所是常有他們的足跡的；眞是「揮金如土」，充分地表演出「金飯碗」的「派頭」。收入少的，每月僅有幾十元或十幾元的，如果家庭經濟也並不富裕的話，所謂銀行員的「塲面」又不得不擺一些的，那末「寅吃卯糧」「日處窮境」，而負債纍纍的也不是罕有的事。還有一種，收入也是很少的人，對於吃着兩士面不很講究的，表面上一點也看不出他們是吃「金飯碗」的，辦公時間過後就在宿舍裏或是俱樂部裏消遺的，或則是埋頭於圖書室的，這一種人大都是練習生或是初級助員。跟着各人的「生活動向」有不同，銀行便產生T各種不同的人。風流雋逸的固然是銀行員，悲觀頺喪以至於改行換業的也是銀行員，希望最大出路最廣最容易成功的也是銀行員。</p>
<p>同樣是銀行員：有的失敗，有的成功，「失敗和成功都是由自己的力决定的」；銀行員對於這一點更有特殊的認識—尤其是「靑年行員」，雖然「親」的關係是左右了銀行員的地位在今日。（完）</p>
<h3>記第五十團童子軍</h3>
<p>— 阿荷</p>
<p>『童子軍』這名稱，是在一九〇八年爲英國陸軍中尉貝登堡Sir　RobeertBaden　powell所始創，自始創至今，已有上三十餘年的歷史了。它的目的，專在使童子練習傳發信號，探訪，野外旅行，觀察事物等等的技能，以養成忠信，仁慈，獨立，果敢，沈毅的美德。其立意，眞是値得吾們提倡的；因此，在目前的世界的每一角落里，差不多都有了這種聯合了童子而成軍事性質的團體組織。</p>
<p>論到中國的有童子軍，歷史也不算短了，目前社會上的一般人士，不知道童子軍三個字的大概很少很少。而在童子軍本身方面，的確，會經幹過不少偉大的，轟轟烈烈的工作，其給予吾們的深刻的印象，的是不能磨滅的；童子軍今日在社會上所以會得到無數的讚美與稱許，不消說得，也是由每個童子軍自己所造成。</p>
<p>本市的童子軍，在過去或者在現在，都是挺有榮譽的，一切都給人以上好的滿意。小者，每逢有什麽集會，典禮舉行，而需要他們出來維持秩序的時候，他們總是怎樣的熱心的，誠懇的；大者，如一二八，八一三戰事爆發之後，他們也是很與敢地參加各項救護，輸送的工作。在南京城外的檢渡，徐州的突圍，武漢的破壞，廣州市的失陷，湘桓的大火等諸役中，本市的童子軍都會留下了許多的豐功偉業。</p>
<p>在本市的各團童子軍中，尤以第五十團爲最有功續，最値得吾們的敬仰了。一二八戰役的時候，該團有毛徵祥等四位寒子軍，冒死出入於槍林彈雨下，終於殉雞；後來就在市商會的空地上，樹了一塊紀念石碑，上面刻了四烈士的名字，略歷，算是紀念他們的。八一三戰事開啟之後，他們的工作就比以前，更顯得緊張而動人，可貴了。在下面，且就吾所知道的該團該况，報　給諸位讀者吧。（已見昨日本報本埠新聞者從略）</p>
<p>戰事正在上海臨近的四周圍劇烈地進行着的時候，他們就在各傷兵醫院中服務，直至國軍西撤，才吿停頓。但仍組織所謂『探路急救隊』冒險前往各火綫上去搶救傷兵與難民。</p>
<p>再後，他們又隨軍自上海經蘇州，南京長沙至漢口搬運各項醫藥用品。同時，更從上海向浙束輸送傷兵。長沙旣大火，他們的總部，就遷往祁陽，籌備在後方服務的大綱。在目前，他們的工作人員均分佈在蘇，浙，皖，贛，豫，鄂，陝，川，湘，桂，粵，黔，滇等十三省中。又據他們最近的服務報吿上聲稱，他們自二十六年八月十三日起至二十七年年底止，共歷程六十三萬公里，護送兵民七萬餘人。</p>
<p>按第五十團童子軍，爲本市市商會所組織，參加服務的，均係二十歲左右的職業靑年；為了祖國的命運，他們都情願拋棄了甜密的家庭，分赴內地去奮鬥，去幹那艱巨的工作。最近有一位名蒼成全者（前曾供職於本市龍門書店，與春生運動器具公司），因押送藥品，途經貴陽，自身瘴氣，而逝於貴陽中央醫院——此種爲國捐軀的偉大精神，眞是値得吾們欽倆，摹仿的！</p>
<p>身處孤島上的靑年友人們呀！你們看了第五十團童子軍所做的事業，又怎樣的感想呢？覺得慚愧嗎?請你們迅速起來，用堅苦與不斷的工作，來代替昇平的歌舞吧！</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖</p>
<p>何雙玉道：『那末石湖裏也通潮嗎？』君素道：『這裏距海較遠，不覺潮生的了。可是據故老傳言，說是舊曆八月十八那一天，潮長最盛的那夜裏，可以到石湖裹。蘇人的看串月，就是水湖經了夜潮的影響，蕩漾在橋洞的緣故，但這種話，我想也還待攷。不過石湖這個地方，濱臨太湖，鄉村環繞，不能似西湖的寗靜，也不能似西湖的專爲一個游覽區域呢。你們瞧！我們在這裏還坐不到半個鐘頭，那邊駛過的小汽艇，小輪船，就有十幾條，都是開往別個市鎭去的，可見得這裹是往來孔道呀！』何儷玉道：『這裏游人倒不多呢。你瞧許多游艇，也都本閑着呀！昨天我們在上海，金澹雲姊姊陪了我們到大塲先烈墓去，那邊的游人倒很多。到底上海是個商埠，蘇州是個內地的緣故吧？』吳君素喝了一口茶，點點頭道：『上海那個地方，人口也實在太繁密了，現在統計有七百萬人口，比戰前加了一倍。但昨天先烈墓那裏的游人多，因爲昨天是個星期日呀。不是我昨天也在上海嗎？眞個上海這樣的繁盛，應該疏散疏散纔是。從前上上海的人口，比日本東京還少。近來上海的人口率，不但超過了東京人口率，而且超過了德國柏林的人口率咧。自然蘇州遠不及上海那樣的繁盛，然而因爲今天是個星期一。現在蘇州不比像從前那樣的寫意朋友太多了，也大家要有事可作。作工者作工，務農者務農，上學者上學，沒有以前那樣的閑散。不是休息日子，不許游玩。就是靑年們，要像戰前那樣的充大少爺，大小姐，那是不可能的了。』何雙玉過：『怎麽的充大少爺，大小姐呢?愛人姊她也是蘇州人，從來也沒有講起過呢。』吳君案道：『愛人姊是住居在鄕下，她從小就刻苦勞動，她是不會知道的。不比我是住在城內，不瞞兩位姊姊說，我家是一個大族，我們是世代簪纓，我們有田，有地，有房產，有營業，雖然不能算是個鉅富，也可以算得數一數二的人家了。我那時年紀小，不曾享得什麽大少爺，大小姐的福，可是我也見過他們的舒服寫意了。』（五三）</p>

<h3>舊劇前途的展望（六）</h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>我爲什麼這樣譬喻呢，因爲我總覺得舊劇好像劉阿斗，他雖然捧不起，但，他畢竟是個寶座上的王，另外宣稱改良舊劇的，不能成爲正統。一切妄想改良舊劇的，我還是勸他們放棄這個野心，儘可創立一種新的名目出來；如繃繃戲南方歌劇等，倒較聰明些，不必定要假借舊劇的名義，弄得不倫不類。我不是說過麽，舊劇已好比一件新出土的　鼎或商彝，可是新時代却不需要它；用來摩挲玩賞則可，假如施以斧鑿，想把它改成一件日用器皿，拿來應用，那就變爲笨伯的行徑了。</p>
<p>前年曾有一個機會，和張彭春教授就戲劇問題作十日談。談到舊劇的前途，他完全同意我的見解，茲後拿他所補充的意見作爲本篇結論：</p>
<p>舊劇是我國藝術上一種劃時代的光榮收穫，它本身在歷史上自有不可磨滅的價値。可是時代的飚輪進展得太快，舊劇已因追趕不上而失去了它所有的觀業，以致日趨式微，前途黯淡。雖然有人想用「改良」來挽救，可是愈改愈糟，怕速舊劇固有的一點精華，都有失傳的危險。抗戰以來，話劇電影都在爲國宣勞，獨有舊劇躱在最後方，專供有閒階級消遺，一無建樹；將來抗戰勝利之後，論功行賞，舊劇不但沒份，勢將被一般新青年所遺忘鄙視。但話雖如此，舊劇還是不會輕易湮沒的，爲了有它藝術上的地位。我希望不久大局奠定，復興建設之際，中央可仿國術館的辦法，特設一所國劇館，延攬和集中一切舊劇人才，使做收集，保存，整理，研究種種工作。並附設學校，造就人才，凡有發見，刊書公布；間或公演，以供眞正舊劇愛好者的觀摩。一方面盡量利用留聲機電影，把現在僅存的那些伶工耆宿的演技，一一收入蠟片攝入鏡頭，藏之博物館，使一代國竇，不致湮沒無存。這樣，率性把舊劇關進象牙之塔去，倒免了它露在外面，受風吹雨蝕，慚歸淘汰；我想這總比「改良」「前進還好些。有人一定會罵我迂腐吧，迂腐在那裏呢？「古」的東西，原來沒有不好「玩」的。（完）</p>
<h3>影業動態</h3>
<p>— 黛兒</p>
<p>夢想美金發週薪</p>
<p>新華公司是中國目前製片界一個規模最大的組織，這次全部由美商中國聯合影業公司接辦，事出倉卒，頗引起社會之注意。據說美商資本雄厚，準備擴大製片規模。三月一日該公司同人數百人集會，一致議决加入美商新公司，次日便刋登啟事於各報。這不能不說是年來影壇的第一件大事了。</p>
<p>那天開會之後，新華男女職演員都在丁香花園製片塲內散步閒談，他們越說越起勁，甲說：「從今天起所發的薪水也許會變成美國金元也說不定。」乙說：「不光發美金，也許照好萊塢的定例改月薪爲週薪也說不定。」丙說：「美國大班看我們勞苦功高時，也許每人送住宅一幢，汽車一部也說不定。」眞是痴人說夢，想入非非。如果夢想能够實現，這班從業員就够闊了。例如小時月薪一百元的，現在變成了一星期美金一百元。合現在滙價計算，美金一元可兌法幣六元餘。卽以六元計算，每月可得法幣二千四百元。多麽可觀的數目啊。</p>
<p>提高片價算港幣</p>
<p>自戰事發生以來，國產影片的銷售市塲縮小了許多。內地各省都不能去，最大的市塲還是南洋羣島。年來外匯暴漲，新嘉坡小呂宋的外幣一元可兌法幣三元以上，可是購片價却仍照舊價計算，這自然是片商佔了便宜，製片者吃了虧。爲了彌補這個缺憾起見，最近新華藝華國華等製片家却議决一致改售港幣，概不貶價求現。例如從前每拷貝售法幤二千元的，現在改售港幣二千元。同樣二千元，滙率却平添了一千六七百元之多。實行以來，片商都無條件答應了。製片業得此補助，獲益不少。</p>
<p>可是工作人員却埋怨地說：「片子買出去好算　幣，可是發薪爲什麽不也照港幣來得痛快。」</p>
<p>可是製片家也有共苦衷，夥計們且埋頭工作別多打便宜算盤。</p>
<p>國產巨片映期長</p>
<p>夏歷新年已過了半月了，三部除夕開映的國產古裝巨片却從容不迫地做下去，一時似無換映新片的動靜。國人歡迎國片愛用國貨的熱度可見一斑。返覜幾家映第一輪西片的大戲院已經換映了好幾次新片了。每部新片上映不過映三四天工夫，而且觀衆並不踴躍，要像滬光「木蘭從軍」之一日四五塲，塲塲客滿，非早一天買不到票的盛况，相差有天淵之別。無怪外國片商都感到不安呢</p>
<p>有人說：西洋影片只能短跑，國產影片才算長距離的賽跑能手呢。</p>
<p>美人問鼎購「木蘭」</p>
<p>「木蘭從軍」預料可做過弟二個月，截至現在未滿半月，獲利已達十六萬元以上。同時香港也在開映呢。片價拆賬自然是算港幣囉。日前已有美國片商要購木蘭的全美映權，可是華成當局却不願於此時開價，必須等到滬光做完之後才能够估價。本片將來獲利必定超過「貂蟬」以上無疑。</p>
<h3>仙霓社覓得新地盤　在仙樂大戲院演唱日場　已簽訂合同今日起登台</h3>
<p>— 玉繩</p>
<p>碩果僅存的崑戲集團—仙霓社，本來附庸於東方飯店內的東方劇塲，每日演唱下午五時半至七時半一塲，去歲農曆年底台同期滿，東方原欲仙霓社續訂合同，因爲關於「所有演員祗准增加不能减少」一條，仙霓社要求刪除，東方主人不允，雙方爭持不决，於是已卯新年就未曾繼續。</p>
<p>仙霓社自退出東方劇塲後，即開始尋覓新地盤，一度曾與馬浪路大華舞廳接洽，擬假舞廳專演日塲，結果因照會打不通，而且多數團員，認爲老大華塲址也不適宜演崑戲，因而作爲罷論。</p>
<p>現在，經仙霓社張傳芳奔走的結果，已與王君達王美玉夫婦主持的仙樂大戲院談判成功，仙樂的話劇，日塲演至五點半爲止，夜塲是八點鐘開始，其間空着的五點三刻至七點三刻兩小時，决定讓與仙霓社演一塲戲，售票所得，仙霓社與仙樂各半分拆，廣吿費電費都歸仙樂負担，合同已於三日晚上簽字，仙霓社方面由朱傳茗張傳芳二人爲全權代表：即於今日元宵節起開始，登臺演唱，三天的劇目排定如下：</p>

<h3>記上海銀行京劇社小綵排</h3>
<p>— 票外</p>
<p>上海銀行爲提倡同人的正當娛樂，早先就有京劇社的設立，牠的歷史已很悠久。滬戰爆發，曾一度停頓過。在去年的冬季又復活了。本月一日他們第一次作小規模的綵排。筆者就在晚上七時跑往仁記路的上海銀行京劇社去，那裏是一間普通的寫字間所改造的，牠的一半作爲戲台，一半排列着看座，壁間懸掛着學戲的規則和本日演出的節目等等，戲台雖是很小，但是台前也裝着兩盞反光燈，台邊也有欄干和電燈。可說是具體而微，設備完全。</p>
<p>當天觀戲的，大多是他們本行同人和演員的家屬，看大家的臉上，都掛着喜悅，另有一位座客，還握着鏡箱，不時吵着眼睛在拍劇照哩。綵排的戲目共計四齣，是：「黄金台—「投軍別窰」「張義得實」，壓軸是「玉堂春」，從起解起到會審止。筆者因爲去時很遲，這時黄金台已將下塲，只見伊立扮相魁偉，田單做工飄逸，未窺金豹，很覺得可惜。投軍別窰在薛平貴登塲時，很有一段做工，和王寶川惜別表情也不錯。陳實德君演來頗用工夫，絲毫不苟；再配上陶瓊芝女士的寶川，唱做勻靜，頗覺貼合。據說他們還是初次上台，有此成續，眞匪容易。第三齣張義得實，由石秉庸君飾康氏，唱工老到，音調宏亮，博得台下彩聲不少；而小丑張義，嬉皮笑臉，一副滑稽相，更使全劇生動有致。最後一齣爲玉堂春，沈維寗君的前蘇三和濮思犖君的崇公道，唱做都非常認眞，規行矩步，自始至終，儀態都很穩定，眞是初學的表率。後蘇三由楊碩民君飾，扮相漂亮，惟身材稍畏；做工亦好，出塲時風頭頗健，所惜戲台太小，而三堂會審人馬父多，以致雖有台步，亦無表演之餘地，全節唱工穩重老練，一曲旣終，每有餘音，頗有梅派氣概，而咬字清楚，尤爲可貴。其餘角色，唱做也非常稱職，無愧壓軸。</p>
<p>從來票房綵排，票友僅任主角配角，其餘總由班底充任，這次上海銀行的綵排，却不然，上自主角，下至龍套，都由票友自己擔任的；甚至擊鈸，拉琴，仇都由行員凑數，這在歷來綵排是並未見過，此種自拉自唱的共同娛樂精神，實在是値得稱道的。</p>
<p>聽說，每月不定期他們有一次實習的綵排，等到純熟以後，還預備公開演劇，售券賑難，這樣，眞是一舉兩得：旣是行員們的業餘遺興，又爲難胞們請命救濟，雖是娛樂，也未失古人「民胞物與」的初衷。</p>

<p>海上各式游藝，都畸形的發達，惟獨歌舞劇却依然很深寂，沒有人注意，或者因為過去那些少女歌舞團所予一般人的印象不佳，所以大家便冷淡起來了。近來無意間聽得朋友說起一對小姊妹花，年齡極小，而能歌善舞，爲了好奇心的驅使，前天晚上特地踏進了仙樂舞宮，約莫十時光景，在一道粉紅色的電炬下，那兩位小舞星出塲了，全塲來賓都站起來，眞是刮目相看。她倆第一個節目，是「娃娃舞」，珠喉圓潤，而舞姿輕快，好像很純熟的樣子。最有趣的還是那較小的一位，走起路來搖搖擺擺，要是形容其幼小，正是母親懷抱中的嬰兒，然而唱的歌，蹈的舞，倒是怪老練的。在十分鐘的動作中，看不出什麽破綻來，雖說這是天才，却還不能忽視教練奢的苦功。接着她又站在椅上，正對擴音機唱一支歌兒，也非常動聽，博得滿堂彩聲。</p>
<p>後來承謝葆生氏介紹她倆的教師楊銘新君，和我談了五分鐘，纔知道那姊姊名呌呂家鳳，藝名洋囡囡，妹妹呂家凰；藝名洋娃娃；呂家的鳳凰，而題以「囡囡」與「娃娃」，可算妙不可言。論起小明星來，上海有陳娟娟吳蓉蓉，好萊塢有秀蘭鄧波兒和金蕙漱，她們登台的年齡，却在十歲以上，而她倆姊是五周歲，妹只三十二個月，居然就能登台歌舞，你說稀奇不稀奇？</p>
<p>楊君說在「八一三」的戰事發生前一個月，他開始敎練起，想當時她一邊吃奶，一邊教她歌唱，這種啟蒙的工作，眞不是好玩的，要是沒有耐性和深知兒童心理的人，却是不敢嘗試的。這二十個月來，她倆已經學會十幾齣歌舞，而且都能上台表演。大凡小孩的惡習，喜歡吃糖果，吃閑食，不聽話，不知禮貌，他所教的呂家洋囡囡，已經革除這些惡習，所以很能保持健康美的條件。</p>
<p>楊君向以教練兒童歌舞爲業，有好多個歌舞團及游藝塲的歌舞班，他都任過教練，陳娟娟便是他訓練成功的第一個。現在他打算籌備一個歌舞團，招收三歲至十歲以內的小孩做團員，以嶄新的姿熊出現於社會。他早年曾做過七年幼稚園教師，所以有敎練幼童的興趣和經騐。我也希望他拿出看家本領來，爲一般天才兒童或是苦難兒童打開一條光明的生路。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二一）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>精忠廟被香火道人侵佔的秘聞</p>
<p>久居故都的人，朝氣全無，暮氣極深，大家都抱着各掃鬥前雪的主義，走在樹底下猶恐樹葉子砸了頭；要講到愛國思想，團體組織，那根本不是他們所願聞的。梨園行人雖在平市佔到很多的數字，爲全國各埠之冠，但是他們的團結力，更是溥弱的可憐；因此若干萬的廟產，和具有百餘年歷史的精忠廟，竟不費吹灰之力的被人侵奪了去。不佞因性嗜考古，故乘旅平之便，托友入介紹，始得暢覽該廟的遺蹟，並由某老伶工詳吿以建造及被人侵佔的始末，所以特意把它敘述出來。這也足見伶界人的自己放任權利，不知保存他們前輩艱難締造以剏成的廟中各種事業，實屬一件很可痛惜的事呢。</p>
<p>大老板程長庚，因爲人格道德技藝等樣樣都駕乎儕輩之上，因此遂以三慶班主的地位，兼管四喜·春台·和春·三大徽班的事務。那時故都的伶界人才，凡稍有聲望的全隸屬在四大徽班裏，長庚旣已總領四班，所以精忠廟廟首一席，無疑的竟非他莫屬了。彼寺伶界收入甚豐，名角如林，除宮廷外，王公府邸復不時傳差，所得額外收人，當亦可觀。因遂集資建造精忠廟於前門外西珠市口迤南之空地上，廟門坐西向東，進門有一大戲台，亦係東向者，西南北三面全爲樓房，演劇時，女客皆坐樓上，二門左右兩旁，各開小門，通南北兩偏院，南院約較北院大四倍有寄，二門內有南北耳房各兩間，大殿三間，兩廊各三間，現均改建爲串樓，巍峨宏壯，滿　古玩書畫，爲看廟之香火道人養靜之所。大殿後尙有一廣大花園，樹木花草，栽種甚多。除此廟外，還購　義塚地若干畝，附屬於該廟的，有市房數處，及附郭的良田若干頃，每年除會昌繳納的會費不算外，就單　房租同糧食的收入，也很够廟內一切開支而有餘了。</p>

The battle is fierce, unprecedented since the second phase of the war. The Chinese army is fully engaged in battle east of the Xiang River. The Japanese army is using a combination of artillery, poison gas, and fierce attacks on Sunqiao. The Chinese army is also fighting to the death with all its strength. Up to the fifth day, after nine days and nights of bloody battle, the total number of casualties on both sides has reached five to six thousand. The Chinese army has achieved a one-to-one casualty ratio, which is a new record since the start of the war. The Japanese army has suffered repeated heavy blows but continues to reinforce. The situation on the highway east of the Xiang River remains stable for now. The Japanese army is now suddenly increasing its forces to the north. The fighting near Dongqiao and Shekou is fierce. A certain famous Chinese general is personally commanding at the front and strictly prohibits any units from crossing the river to the west. (Special telegram, 8:00 PM on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Jingmen Telegram, 4th: The Japanese army invading central Hubei along the Hanyi Road has increased by 7,000 troops, more than ten artillery pieces, and more than ten tanks. After being ambushed by a certain Chinese brigade on the north side of the highway, they changed their attack to a certain army position at Yangjiahe. They also dispatched a unit to Xia Yanggang, Hejiaji, and Jianfu Family Terrace to launch a fierce flanking attack on the Chinese army. An unprecedented battle for control has unfolded over the past two days. The Chinese army's positions have been repeatedly in danger, but thanks to the loyal and brave officers and soldiers of the Chinese army fighting to the death, the situation has been turned from danger to safety. The fighting is still ongoing on the 4th. Currently, the Chinese army has concentrated its main forces to attack the Japanese army from both sides. The local authorities have decided to allocate huge sums of money to improve the connection of various highways. A plan has been drafted and will be submitted to the ministry for handling. (Special telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Zhongxiang: The focus of the battle in central Hubei is on the Jingzhong Road. Two Japanese regiments have been fiercely attacking this line for days. Yesterday, one route of the Japanese army attacked the northwest of Dongqiao Town, 30 miles from here, and another route attacked Mumazhen, south of Cheqiao Town. After the Chinese army fought bravely to resist, the Japanese were defeated on both fronts. The Japanese army fled northwest from Sanyangdian. This morning, because the key points of Houjiaji and Zhangjiaji were occupied by the Chinese army, the Japanese army immediately retreated south. A certain Chinese commando unit intercepted them, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. About 2,000 Japanese troops in Zhengjiaji, east of Jiukou, were counterattacked by the Chinese army yesterday, and most retreated to Sanyikou and Yejiaji. The Chinese army is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in these two places. On the Yonglong River, the Chinese have effective troops confronting the Japanese army. There is no change in the Yuekou area. (Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, since the Japanese army invaded Hainan Island, casualties have reached 5,000. The battle situation on Hainan Island is now stabilizing. The Chinese guerrilla forces on the island are all based in the mountainous areas of the interior. They are constantly attacking the Japanese communication lines in the five coastal districts. At the same time, due to the extremely hot climate on Hainan Island and the lack of acclimatization, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers have fallen ill. The Japanese are now seeking to send 30 Japanese doctors from Taiwan to provide medical care. As for the southwest coast of Guangdong, the situation remains very tense, as the Japanese are still planning to land on the Leizhou Peninsula. (Associated Press Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>Xia County, Southern Shanxi: Japanese Army's Western Offensive Repelled, Many Wounded Soldiers Transported to Yuci, Japanese Increase Fortifications in Taiyuan Suburbs</h3>
<p>Yuanqu: At 5:00 PM on the 3rd, a Japanese force of about 100 men, taking advantage of the dense fog, advanced from Guanmiao Qian "south of Xia County" towards the Chinese army's Wenjiazhuang alert line. They were severely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered more than a dozen casualties and collapsed. The Chinese army only suffered one soldier wounded. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Hequ: More than 1,000 Japanese troops have been added to Ningwu. The Japanese have launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army positions on the watershed southwest of the county and in Dongzhai, using four airplanes to assist in the battle.

<p>(Xi'an) In recent days, it has been common to see wounded soldiers and corpses transported by the Japanese army from southern Shanxi to Yuci and Shijiazhuang. Electric-controlled landmines have been installed in the suburbs of Taiyuan to prevent the Chinese army from attacking, indicating that the Chinese army's guerrilla warfare in southern Shanxi has been successful. The Yamaga Regiment, numbering about 2,000 men, is now stationed in Taiyuan, strictly prohibiting the export of goods. Merchants engaged in transit trade have been unable to operate. (Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to what Chinese military sources told the Associated Press reporter, the recent activity of the Japanese army in Shanxi indicates that the Japanese army has been or is currently launching a two-pronged attack in southern and southeastern Shanxi. At present, there are three Japanese divisions, mostly concentrated in Houma and Anyang. The purpose of this move by the Japanese army is to eliminate the centers of activity of the Eighth Route Army guerrillas, including Zhu De's headquarters in a certain place. The Japanese army's targets of attack include Yuanqu, Puxian, Liaoxian, Xinshui, and Yangcheng. The Japanese army has changed its strategy this time, conducting a broader offensive in a larger area. After the B army captures a city, it no longer immediately attacks another city, but first carries out a search of the countryside, intending to concentrate its attacks on the key activity centers of the Chinese army. The purpose of this method of attack is to destroy the guerrilla's retreat strategy and form a "spider web," hoping to use this to surround the Chinese army's guerrillas. The Japanese army is building cement houses throughout the area, creating a "ring of iron" to surround the guerrillas. According to recent American military observers from Beiping, Japanese officers have also personally admitted that after occupying Yuanqu and Puxian, the Japanese army failed to hold them firmly, because the surrounding mountains were all bases of guerrilla activity, cutting off the Japanese army's supply lines. In many cities in Shanxi, after being occupied by the Japanese army many times, they were eventually recovered by the Chinese army's guerrillas. (Associated Press Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>All Sectors of Chongqing Expand Anti-Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) From the "July 7th Incident" to the fall of Yuezhou was the first phase of the war, the period after that is the second phase. In the first phase, the Japanese army's conspiracy to quickly defeat China without fighting has been exposed by the Chinese army. Now, in the second phase, the military has turned to the mountainous areas far from the transportation lines. The Japanese have lost their geographical advantage, and coupled with the various chaotic situations in Japan, the Japanese are in a dilemma. In an attempt to save their declining situation, the Japanese have put forward the preposterous slogan of establishing a new order in East Asia, attempting to quickly negotiate a peace and trap China in their trap, making it their slave for all time. In order to expose the Japanese plot, we will hold the first propaganda week of the second phase of the war from March 6th to 12th to support President Chiang's rebuttal of Konoe's absurd statement, the speech, and the main points of the opening speech of the Fifth Plenary Session. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Propaganda rallies will be held uniformly in all places during the week. (2) Special radio broadcasts and lectures will be held. (3) Newspapers and publications will issue special issues. (4) Local authorities will organize propaganda teams to distribute propaganda in rural areas. (5) Lectures will be held in various schools. (6) Special propaganda will be held in various cinemas, theaters, and other entertainment venues. In addition, a large number of propaganda leaflets will be prepared and distributed to the war zones. It is also heard that the Central Broadcasting Station has invited ministers and heads of various ministries and departments to give radio lectures during the propaganda week. Those who have been scheduled include President Kong of the Executive Yuan, President Dai of the Examination Yuan, Minister Wang of the Foreign Ministry, Minister Ye of the Central Propaganda Department, Minister Chen of the Political Department, and Minister He of the Military Administration Department.

<h3>Chongqing's Fundraising Competition: Women Donate 700,000, Led by Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Breaking the Record Held by the Banking Sector</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today is the women's day of the two-week patriotic fundraising competition in Chongqing. Two thousand women gathered here. The patriotic donations from Chongqing women totaled 700,000 yuan, breaking the record held by bankers. President Chiang stated during his speech, "I have always believed that the strength of women is stronger than that of men. Today, this has been proven. Their strength is more than double." President Chiang also shouted, "Long live the women comrades!" Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling said, "Our success is due to our consistent organization and cooperation, and because we are constantly encouraged by our compatriots." This patriotic fundraising movement by women was led by Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling. Therefore, today's donations were made by Madame Chiang on behalf of the women. When the Secretary-General of the New Life Movement announced the amount of donations, the band played music for those who donated more than 10,000 yuan. Madame Chiang announced that her brothers Soong Ziwen, Soong Ziliang, Soong Zi'an, and her two sisters Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Qingling and Madame Kung Hsiang-hsi Soong Ailing, each donated 10,000 yuan from their estates. Kung Hsiang-hsi had previously donated 10,000 yuan from his personal funds. Today, he donated another 70,000 yuan. Foreign journalists who were invited to attend also automatically donated 140 yuan and one US dollar and one British pound. Huang Wei (transliteration), a war correspondent for a Chinese newspaper in Singapore, auctioned off a Japanese army coat he obtained from the front lines in North China. Mrs. Zhao also auctioned off her gold watch. (Associated Press Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The frugal donation competition in Chongqing on the 5th was the eighth day, also known as Women's Donation Day, presided over by Madame Chiang. After the donations began, the competition was very intense. The largest donation was 150,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance and 40,000 yuan from the Military Affairs Commission. Then the six Soong siblings (i.e., the three Kung, Sun, and Chiang sisters, as well as Ziwen, Zian, and Ziliang) jointly donated 100,000 yuan. President Kung alone donated 50,000 yuan. Various agencies also contributed to continued fundraising, raising a total of 632,359.32 yuan, an unprecedented record for donation competitions in various places. President Chiang also personally visited and, amidst cheers from the crowd, stood up to give instructions, saying that today's glorious patriotic movement has not only caused a sensation throughout the country, but has also attracted the attention of the world. I now thank you on behalf of the soldiers who are fighting hard at the front. In view of the people's emotions and spirit, not only will this guarantee that our country's current war of resistance will win the final victory, but also during the future nation-building period, it will generate even greater strength to engage in the great cause of nation-building. Finally, I want to shout, "Long live the women compatriots of the whole country!" Madame Chiang also gave a speech, encouraging the women compatriots to unite as one and strive to create a strong and glorious Republic of China. (Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>General Mobilization of the Spirit</h3>
<p>"Success is achieved with one heart, failure comes with divided minds," this is one of the philosophical foundations of the success or failure of China and Japan. In China: resistance means survival, non-resistance means destruction; and all kinds of suffering are caused by Japanese aggression; the morale is high. Examine the war zones or cities that have been bombed. Even if loved ones are killed or injured, families are destroyed, and they suffer all kinds of hardships, those whose lives are hanging by a thread will never blame the resistance. This kind of phenomenon where people share the same heart and the same reasoning can be said to be ironclad evidence that can be found everywhere in China. In Japan: members of parliament are still questioning the meaning and purpose of using troops against China; the people are hesitant and suspicious, and anti-war sentiment is gradually surfacing; and the letters and diaries of their fallen soldiers are especially filled with war-weariness. The two sides are very different, and China will surely succeed with one heart.</p>
<p>However, if we further enrich and temper it, the achievements of the war of resistance will be even more magnificent. According to a recent telegram from Chongqing, the central government has issued the "Outline for the General Mobilization of the National Spirit" and its implementation measures, which is to enrich and temper the existing shared heart and reasoning, and evolve from an abstract concept into a concrete norm. Regarding the outline, it lists three common goals of the national spirit: national supremacy, national supremacy; military first, victory first; concentration of will, concentration of strength. It lists loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace as the eight virtues of the general mobilization of the national spirit, and highlights loyalty and filial piety as the foundation. It takes the Three Principles of the People as the only faith in nation-building, that is, it takes the completion of the purpose of the Three Principles of the People as the destination of the general mobilization of the national spirit. For the transformation of the spirit, it especially emphasizes five points: the life of drunken dreams must be corrected; the vigorous spirit of vitality must be cultivated; the habit of living in a makeshift way must be eliminated; the attempt to be selfish and self-seeking must be broken; and the divergent and miscellaneous thoughts must be corrected. As for leading the mobilization, it is the responsibility of party members and civil servants, all military personnel, national leaders from all walks of life, and the youth of the whole country. The leading personnel of each organization are the main body for implementing the mobilization. For its implementation, first, formulate a concrete plan to ensure that it penetrates the subordinate elements; further, use existing organizations, pay attention to liaison and progress, to achieve the completion of the "total".</p>
<p>Among them, what we want to introduce to society most is the matter of implementation. Indeed, the general mobilization of the spirit is easy to know its necessity, easy to know its necessity; but it also seems very broad and difficult to define, it seems very vague and difficult to be practical; and it also has a wrong impression, it seems that since the launch of the war of resistance, the public sentiment has been exuberant, those who have given money have given money, those who have contributed their strength have contributed their strength, and it can be said that the general mobilization of the spirit has already been carried out. However, this is not the case. There are not many matters to be implemented, so it cannot be said to be broad; they all belong to the daily life, so it cannot be said to be vague; with these matters, considering the reality, it is necessary for everyone to work hard to realize everything, and the current situation is still very far from the completion of the general mobilization of the spirit. What are these matters?</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the correction of the life of drunken dreams: A, rectify the daily life of the people and ban all improper entertainment: B, ban luxury and extravagance and all unnecessary waste, C, limit consumption and reduce the import of luxury goods: D, persuade the people to reduce their living standards and implement universal austerity.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the cultivation of vigorous vitality: A, cherish time, cherish manpower and materials: B, expand wartime production, increase national working hours and efficiency; C, organize and train the people, and give appropriate distribution to wartime work.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the elimination of the habit of living in a makeshift way: A, publicize the failure of Japan's political and military strategies, and the reality that the Chinese army is getting stronger and stronger; B, report all idle and lazy elements, and force wartime service; C, eliminate dependence on the international community, the mentality of relying on luck, and the illusion of compromise halfway.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding breaking the attempt of selfishness and self-interest: A, earnestly eliminate corruption; B, encourage the people to destroy their families and alleviate the difficulties of the country, and donate personal property to war expenses; C, collect all military supplies and contribute to the national government; D, earnestly promote various movements to contribute to the country in spirit or material.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding correcting divergent and miscellaneous thoughts; A, rectify the organization and training of people's groups; B, unify the organization and work guidelines of cultural groups; C, ban disputes and illegal activities that hinder the war of resistance; D, correct the tendency of opinions in various newspapers and publications.</p>
<p>We have already said that the above-mentioned matters are still far from this standard in the current situation, and Shanghai is the furthest distance; however, the general society's ability to move in this direction cannot be concealed. From moving in the direction to approaching the standard, it lies in enriching the strength of moving in the direction, in order to increase the speed of moving in the direction; and the method of enriching the strength still lies in the tempering of will and action. Didn't we say earlier that the issued outline and implementation methods assign the responsibility for leading the mobilization to party members and civil servants, all military personnel, national leaders from all walks of life, and the youth of the whole country? In Shanghai, we especially look forward to the social leaders and youth, as well as the leaders in various circles and institutions! Don't say that it is not easy to promote and that it is difficult to achieve practical results; why not imagine what kind of society it would be after the general mobilization of the spirit has achieved 30-50% or even 80-90% results, then we know that people with lofty ideals and aspirations will surely act in person and move forward.</p>
<h3>The Entire National Education Sector Works Together to Promote the Three Principles of the People Education, Taking Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and a Sense of Shame as Common School Mottoes, Realizing the Principles to Strive for Final Victory, Chairman Chiang's Admonition to the Education Conference</h3>
<p>Recognizing Responsibility in Three Major Matters</p>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) The most basic task of education lies in the cultivation of national character. If we want to cultivate the national character of the entire population, we must ask the entire education sector to recognize its own position and responsibilities, concentrate on one goal, set an example, and create a universal atmosphere. Here, I have a few important words to remind all of you in the education sector. First, I ask our education sector to recognize the meaning of "respecting teachers and valuing the Way." The Book of Learning says, "In the way of learning, strict teachers are difficult. Only when the teacher is strict can the Way be respected. Only when the Way is respected will the people know to respect learning." Second, if we want to cultivate national character, we must have a consistent standard. In moral education, there must be common key points. While the detailed rules for the implementation of moral education may vary due to different regions and stages, the standards for moral education can be determined collectively. Currently, schools at all levels often formulate their own standards, which are inconsistent. My personal opinion is that the late Premier's eight virtues of benevolence, filial piety, fraternity, love, faithfulness, righteousness, harmony and peace can be set as codes of conduct for young people and party members. The four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame can be used as common school mottoes for lower-level schools throughout the country. These four virtues contain our country's inherent national benevolence and righteousness, and contain the qualities that citizens must possess. We use the meaning of "propriety" to teach the people to help and cooperate with each other. We use the meaning of "justice" to train the people to be responsible and willing to sacrifice. We use the meaning of "integrity" to teach the people to be hardworking and enduring, to distinguish between public and private matters, to abide by their duties, and to prevent encroachment. We use the meaning of "a sense of shame" to train the people to be self-reliant and self-improving, to know how to struggle, and to know how to be enterprising. In this way, these precepts, which have been deeply rooted in people's hearts for thousands of years, can shape the character of modern citizens, and then ensure the survival and development of the nation. Third, I ask our education sector to move towards a concentrated goal and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People. Since the first National Education Conference in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, when we resolved to promote the Three Principles of the People Education, it has been ten years to this day. Even the promulgation of the educational purpose of the 18th year of the Republic of China is now ten years ago. Before the War of Resistance, our people and the general youth had not actually received the widespread education of the Three Principles of the People. Even in the present War of Resistance, we cannot sincerely and consistently believe in the Three Principles of the People. This is certainly the misfortune of the country, and it is indeed a common disgrace to our education sector.</p>
<p>Concentrating Under the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>I believe that if the highest principles of revolution and nation-building cannot be universally imparted to the people, then the revolution cannot succeed and the country cannot escape danger. Our education sector bears the great responsibility for survival, prosperity, and decline. We must not outwardly comply but inwardly oppose the highest principles of the country. We must not accept them in form but still do things our own way in practice. The responsibility of education is to teach the people. A people without trust cannot stand. If the education sector first disagrees in heart and mouth, does not value trustworthiness, and does not emphasize implementation, how can we guide the people to the point of unified will and concentrated spirit? We know that the rise and fall of countries and nations, throughout ancient and modern times, at home and abroad, have always occurred. Whenever danger is turned into safety, it is always because intellectuals and the education sector, amidst divergent opinions and declining public morale, concentrate like-minded people into one goal and strive to shoulder responsibility. Now that the War of Resistance has entered its most important stage, what the enemy fears most is our Three Principles of the People, which are used for revolution and national salvation. If our education sector wants to save the country from danger, we must take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as our own responsibility. The Chinese Kuomintang has always earnestly expected and welcomed talented and wise people with the ambition to save the country to join our party and fight together. Especially during this time of the War of Resistance, when the country's survival hangs by a thread, we feel a deeper sense of camaraderie with the presidents and professors of all universities who are knowledgeable and prescient. The more revolutionary comrades we have, the greater our strength in the War of Resistance, and the easier our nation-building cause will be, and the sooner we will succeed.</p>
<p>With One Heart and One Mind, Self-Reliance and Self-Respect</p>
<p>If we want the revolution to succeed more quickly and strive for victory, at least the compatriots who bear the responsibility of education must work together with one heart and one mind and strive for the Three Principles of the People. Speaking of the efforts of education, as in Xunzi's "Exhortation to Learning," "The eyes do not see but are clear, the ears do not listen but are sharp," it also explains that the ambition of education must be fixed on one goal. If, at the crossroads of four directions, the eyes do not look straight at one end, and the ears do not listen in one direction, the result of wandering and confusion is that we cannot teach scholars who are brave in learning, earnest in practice, and save the country and the people. Now that the country is in an extraordinary period, time cannot wait, and national affairs cannot tolerate further mistakes. The lack of firmness and dedication in the past in education has already delayed ten years and caused serious national disasters. I sincerely hope that our education sector, for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, for the happiness of modern youth and future generations, will truly and surely converge on one goal. I hope that all of you virtuous people in the education sector, with one heart and one mind, will gather under the Three Principles of the People and strive for the Chinese revolution. Our national education sector itself has been working doubly hard since the War of Resistance, especially showing our efforts. We have seen the results of the hard work and struggle of the education sector in the war zones, in the occupied areas, and in remote places. I dare say that the victory of this cultivation will surely nurture the fruits of national rejuvenation. What we all hope for is naturally not the rewards of the present, but the comfort given to us after the great achievement of nation-building. However, our education sector must be self-reliant and self-respecting, wholeheartedly and single-mindedly, and implement it with the ambition of cultivating people for a hundred years and the public spirit of "if not me, then who?" What I have said above is contributed to those who are engaged in education and saving the country for life. The ancients said, "If you carve and give up, rotten wood will not break. If you carve without giving up, gold and stone can be opened." This is a certain principle of achieving one's ambition. I sincerely wish this conference success beyond all expectations, and wish our education sector to establish immeasurable merits for the War of Resistance and nation-building. (5th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Since the War of Resistance, Changes in the Chinese Newspaper Industry, 209 Newspapers Have Ceased Publication, There Are Currently 117 Kinds of Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the Hua Fang report, since the Sino-Japanese war began, a total of 209 Chinese newspapers have ceased publication, including 58 in Peiping, 15 in Qingdao, 18 in Nanjing, 27 in Tianjin, and 21 in Guangzhou. At present, there are 117 newspapers in the rear, including 19 in Chongqing, 1 in Xinjiang, and 1 in Qinghai. (Translator's note: The reason why the telegrapher specifically pointed out one in Xinjiang and one in Qinghai is that the above two provinces each have only one newspaper.) Of the 117 in the rear, only one is published in English, namely the former "Hankou English Chu Pao" in Hankou. The newspaper resumed publication in Chongqing four days ago (i.e., March 1). Also, several newspapers formerly published in Shanghai have now moved to Hong Kong for publication, such as Ta Kung Pao, Lih Pao, and Shen Pao. There are currently 20 Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong. Also, Chinese intellectuals publish "paper bullets" in the rear of the Japanese army for Chinese people in the Japanese-occupied areas to read. This kind of Chinese "paper bullets" is most abundant in Shanxi Province, with a total of 45. Currently, guerrilla teams in Shandong Province issue two kinds of newspapers, three in Jiangsu Province, two in Anhui Province, and one in Hebei Province. Among these "paper bullets," the North China edition of the New China Daily and the Former Front edition are the most famous. The North China edition is published in Shanxi, and the Former Front edition is published in Dongxu (transliteration) in Anhui. The printing of the above two newspapers is very good. Also, various periodical magazines are published in the Japanese-occupied areas, one of which is even published in the foreign concessions of Tianjin. Also, a patriotic movement has been launched in the rear of the Chinese front, namely publishing newspapers for soldiers at the front to read, providing them with spiritual food.

<h3>President Roosevelt's Speech, The American Democratic Spirit, The People Enjoy God-Given Freedom, Totalitarianism Is a Disguised Form of Despotism</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech at a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives, recounting the founding of the United States of America, saying, "The United States was founded after a struggle between a majority of national heroes and a majority of traitors." This statement is already well-known. The American people have resisted various enemies with courage for a long time, and finally established a national representative system based on free choice. I would like to specifically state the word "free choice," because this foundation is the ideal of a democratic system, which was already popular all over the world several years ago, before the emergence of totalitarianism. The principles established by the American Constitution have also been adopted by other countries. The so-called democratic system is based on two main concepts: one is that the national electorate should elect a new Congress and a new President every few years, and the other is that this choice should be made freely. This is where the democratic system differs greatly from other political systems. These so-called other political systems, which seem novel on the surface, are actually old things. In essence, they are merely the restoration of a despotic regime. Some may say that we are now exhausted, and therefore we have expressed a fondness for this kind of regime that has returned, which has been proven by the facts of two thousand years to be tyrannical and unstable. This is absolutely not true. The United States and other democratic countries should be cautious so as not to encourage this kind of argument. (All members applauded warmly upon hearing this.) Thereupon, the President discussed the various freedoms listed in the Declaration of Human Rights one by one, and said that the freedoms enjoyed by the American people are actually the weapons to deal with the illegal means left over from the "Dark Ages." "Speaking of freedom of belief, this is one of the main rights of mankind, and the establishment of a representative government is also rooted in this right. On the contrary, in any place where the democratic system has been destroyed, the individual's right to worship God according to his belief is either restricted or completely deprived. If we let it go and remain silent, we are probably encouraging religious discrimination. What the American nation has won by peaceful means is not only freedom of belief, but also various other freedoms that we firmly believe in. These freedoms come with the freedom of choice enjoyed by men and women, and the democratic system clarified in our Constitution is based on this as a guide." (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Congress Celebrates 150th Anniversary, Senate and House Hold Joint Meeting to Celebrate, Various Dignitaries Give Speeches Praising Democratic System</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today is the 150th anniversary of the founding of the US Congress. The Senate and House of Representatives held a special joint meeting to celebrate. President Roosevelt, Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and many other dignitaries gave speeches praising the democratic system. The situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>The joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives was held in the House of Representatives at noon today. All the members of the House of Representatives and the majority of the audience first took their seats. Then, all the senators, led by Vice President and President of the Senate, Garner, and Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, entered the venue in droves. The members of the diplomatic corps and the judges of the Supreme Court followed, and the applause throughout the venue was thunderous and extremely enthusiastic. Afterwards, the senior officers of the Navy and Marine Corps, and all the cabinet members, led by Secretary of State Hull, entered the venue one after another and took their seats next to the platform. At this point, Vice President Garner ascended the podium and announced the arrival of President Roosevelt, and the whole audience cheered wildly for a long time. Under the illumination of the electric lights, the President took his seat. Behind him hung a huge American flag. After the applause subsided, Ms. Swarthout, a famous opera singer, sang the "America" song. After the song, Speaker of the House of Representatives Bankhead, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Barkley, Leader of the Senate Democratic Caucus, gave speeches one after another, praising the American democratic system. After the speeches of the dignitaries, Mr. Thomas, a famous singer from the opera house, sang the "America" song again to entertain the guests. Then, Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court spoke, saying, "Legislative power is the foundation of the democratic system. The authority enjoyed by our country's legislative body, and the responsibilities it bears, have not been destroyed by despotic labor, nor have they been hindered by it. This is something to be thankful for. (Thunderous applause) The greatest aspiration of the American people is that the current administrative system must be preserved. There is no doubt about this." In addition, Hughes defended the rights enjoyed by minorities, which was particularly approved by the whole venue. Finally, President Roosevelt gave a speech, strongly advocating that the government, Congress, and the Supreme Court must cooperate with each other, and the American people firmly adhere to the various freedoms listed in the Declaration of Human Rights. (For the full text of the speech, see another telegram.) The President did not touch on foreign affairs in his speech, which was unexpected by most people. However, he said, "What we call a democratic system refers to men and women who enjoy freedom to freely choose what they like. In other words, this democratic system should be implemented by representatives elected by the people, not directly by the masses." After the President finished speaking, Ms. Swarthout and Mr. Thomas, two singers, sang the "America" song together, and the joint meeting was then declared closed. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Berlin Feels Displeasure</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The speech delivered by US President Roosevelt today on the 150th anniversary of the founding of the US Congress has been fiercely attacked by the semi-official German News Agency, commenting, "President Roosevelt's statement that there is no freedom of belief in totalitarian countries is a slander. The American government relies on a weak majority faction and must issue calls to the masses at any time and place. On the contrary, the German government is supported by 99% of the people in the country, and all its measures are not influenced by political ideas or any interest groups. The two are as far apart as heaven and earth. We do not want to persuade President Roosevelt to embrace the political ideas of the five countries, but we do not allow him to interfere in our country's affairs." What this gentleman calls freedom of speech is nothing more than abuse and incitement. The media in totalitarian countries cannot tolerate it. German newspapers do not use lies and incitement as tools of struggle. Certain politicians and warmongers who constantly provoke are exposed by German newspapers. President Roosevelt admits that he wants to find progress for culture and should take the attitude of German newspapers as an example. As for the freedom enjoyed by public officials, there are many abuses, and there have been many bribery cases recently to prove it. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>US President Submits to Congress an Additional Budget for the Army, Totaling 120 Million Yuan, to be Used to Purchase Military Equipment and Strengthen Coastal Defenses</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Bankhead, requesting the immediate passage of an additional budget for the Army of $123,812,923.7 (Note: The House of Representatives yesterday passed the National Defense Expansion Plan, of which $499,857,936 is required for the Army.) The purpose is as follows: (1) Purchase various necessary military equipment, such as anti-aircraft guns, tank defense guns, cannons, gas masks, etc. (2) Train 20,000 civilian aviation pilots. (3) Strengthen the defense of the Panama Canal, requiring a total of $1,416,373. (4) Strengthen coastal defenses, requiring a total of $3,295,631. At the same time, President Roosevelt also stated that he would request Congress to approve the allocation of funds to build highways in the Panama Canal area in the future. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Invades Hainan Island: Beginning of Southern Expansion Policy; French General to Fill Post of Vietnamese Governor, Expediting Defense Plans</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from here today, the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island was advocated long ago by powerful figures in the Japanese Navy. The Navy has been promoting Japan's southward expansion for several years. Recently, a Japanese political and economic magazine published an article by a naval admiral advocating southward expansion. The article first discussed the abundance of oil, tin, and other resources in Southeast Asia, and then put forward the slogan: "For the sake of the wealth of the Japanese Empire, Japan should expand southward." Furthermore, domestic propaganda in Japan has always emphasized not only the abundance of resources in Southeast Asia, but also that the indigenous people of Southeast Asia are all naked and barefoot. Therefore, cheap Japanese cloth, shoes, and socks will undoubtedly sell well. This is because the living standards of the indigenous people of Southeast Asia are extremely low, and they can only afford to buy Japanese goods. Therefore, if Japan can expand southward, the markets of the Dutch East Indies, other parts of Southeast Asia, and the Philippines will all be acquired by Japan. In theory, this market can be acquired peacefully, but in reality, it is absolutely impossible. Since 1933, after the Dutch East Indies enacted restrictions on imports, Japanese goods imported into the Dutch East Indies have been severely impacted. Forty percent of Japanese exports, including textiles and hardware, have been squeezed out. The result of the Japanese-Dutch East Indies meeting in 1934 was that the import volume of Japanese goods into the Dutch East Indies was further reduced. Thus, it can be seen that the path of peace has truly been blocked. Therefore, the Navy has come to advocate the use of force. At the same time, the Navy has an urgent need for oil, tin, and rubber, and these products are particularly abundant in the Dutch East Indies. Furthermore, the Japanese Army has already gained considerable honor in its war against China, but the Japanese Navy has been left idle, with no place to use its heroism. For these various reasons, the recent occupation of Hainan Island has occurred. Furthermore, this action is actually the initial step in Japan's southward expansion. Hainan and Annam are only a few hundred miles apart, truly within reach. Moreover, after occupying Hainan Island, Japan can form a pincer movement with its mandated islands in the Pacific, taking a flanking position against the Philippines. If an air route is established from the Japanese mandated islands to Hainan Island, it can traverse the Philippines. According to observations from foreign diplomatic circles here, there are four reasons for Japan's occupation of Hainan Island: (1) Because France refused Japan's request to appoint Yosuke Matsuoka as ambassador to France; (2) Because the French Parliament recently advocated that all goods imported into France from Japan must be labeled with the words "Made in Japan." Japan views this action by France as a prelude to boycotting Japanese goods; (3) Since the Munich Conference, Tokyo has largely believed that democratic countries do not have the power to attack dictatorial countries; (4) As a base for attacking the eastern colonies of democratic countries. As for other so-called "military necessities," etc., they are purely deceptive talk. (Reuter, 4th)</p>
<p>Saigon According to reliable sources, the position of Governor-General of French Indochina will henceforth be held by a military officer. The most promising candidate is General Boucher, the former commander-in-chief of the Vietnamese Army. According to opinions here, using a military officer instead of a civilian official for the Governor-General position will allow the currently emphasized defense plan to be completed sooner. The defense plan proposed by the Vietnamese government includes: (1) Training 20,000 new Annamese troops; (2) Improving defenses along the Chinese border; (3) Seeking closer cooperation between naval, land, and air forces. In recent weeks, several new bombers have arrived from France to strengthen the air force here. It is expected that the number of warships in southern Guangdong will increase greatly, as France is currently undertaking an active shipbuilding program. Japan's occupation of Hainan has awakened the attention of French Vietnam to the fact that it is now closer to the Far Eastern theater of war. However, people here remain very calm, as there is no need to worry for the time being. The various indications that the Vietnamese government and Singapore are maintaining extremely close contact are very welcome. Furthermore, the recent visit of Sir Thomas, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, to this country is also considered a very significant event. Admiral Noble, the commander of the British China Fleet, also recently visited Saigon by ship and was warmly welcomed. Noble inspected Cam Ranh Bay, located 200 miles north of Saigon. This bay is a frequent anchorage for French warships. If fortifications are built, it will become a Singapore-like base for French Vietnam. (Reuter, 5th)</p>

<h3>American Dockworkers Block Steel Shipments to Japan; Picketing Movement Extends to Pacific Coast</h3>
<p>The movement to block steel shipments to Japan in Astoria, Oregon, has been remarkably effective in the United States. Recently, twenty-one cars of steel were to be shipped to Japan from this port on the Japanese freighter "Norway Maru." Dockworkers in this port refused to load and unload them, and the strike has lasted for eight days, preventing the shipment. At the same time, 7,000 tons of steel in Portland, 160 kilometers from here, were to be loaded onto the Greek freighter "Staturos" for shipment to Japan. This was discovered by the picketing team organized by Chinese women and children in this port, who plan to stop it. In view of this situation, the local authorities, fearing unexpected disturbances, decided to prohibit the shipment of steel to Japan from tomorrow. In addition, the Greek freighter "Kostis" in Marshfield (300 kilometers south of here) was also prevented by a picketing team from loading steel for export. Similar problems are arising in various ports one after another. Mr. Bridges, president of the Pacific Coast Division of the Industrial Organizations Association, is already considering whether to extend this picketing movement to various ports along the Pacific coast.

<h3>Major Developments Imminent in Indian Situation; Gandhi's Blood Pressure Rises and Sleeps Poorly on Second Day of Fast</h3>
<p>New Delhi The Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, has decided today to shorten his trip to Rajkot and will arrive here tomorrow morning. This news has aroused great attention among political figures here, who believe that major developments may occur tomorrow. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>Rajkot According to a report released today by soldiers attending Gandhi, Gandhi's blood pressure has risen from 168 to 180, his weight has decreased by two pounds, he has slept slightly poorly, and his physical condition has weakened. Mrs. Gandhi, who has been detained in a camp near Rajkot since February 3, was finally brought by the authorities in a car to Gandhi's bedside today. Because Gandhi did not know if his wife had been released, he ordered her to return to the detention camp tonight. According to reports, his wife came to Rajkot specifically to participate in the passive resistance movement, which led to her detention by the authorities. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>Bombay Gandhi is currently fasting because the Raja of Rajkot refuses to implement new policies in his kingdom. The Secretary of the All-India Congress Socialist Party recently published an article on this matter, advocating that an ultimatum with a 24-hour deadline be sent to the British government, which has supreme ruling power, urging it to protect Gandhi's life. If the request is not granted, all cabinet members of the All-India Congress should resign en masse. According to reports, most of the All-India Congress cabinet members have telegraphed the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, requesting him to intervene immediately. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>Bombay It is heard that the Bombay cabinet has now decided that if Gandhi is still fasting on Monday the 12th, the entire cabinet will resign. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>Letter Requests New Pope to Convene World Religious Leaders Conference; Discuss Elimination of War Based on Reason and Common Sense; Key Figure in British Labour Party</h3>
<p>(London) A key figure in the opposition Labour Party, Lansbury, recently sent a letter to the new Pope Pius XII, asking him to convene a conference of Christian and Jewish leaders in Jerusalem during Easter this year. His letter stated, "If responsible politicians from various countries could gather together and conduct discussions based on reason and common sense, then all land, economic, and financial issues that isolate governments and lead to war could find peaceful solutions. It is regrettable that no politician has yet boldly shouted to the world, 'Why don't we prioritize reason?' Therefore, I am now requesting Your Holiness to immediately convene a conference of religious leaders from all over the world, including Jewish leaders, to discuss what methods should be used to pressure politicians from various countries to prevent them from continuing on the path to destruction, and to unite to preserve Christianity, so that it will not perish. If His Holiness can issue such a call, I believe the whole world will be happy to respond." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Pius XII Falls on Stairs; Arm Slightly Injured</h3>

At the same time, it is heard that the Pope intends to restore the tradition of the Vatican and will perform the coronation in the central hall of St. Peter's. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>US President Does Not Plan to Travel Abroad During Term</h3>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials have decided that after the King and Queen of England visit the United States this June, Roosevelt need not reciprocate the visit. The reasons are as follows: (1) The King and Queen's trip is primarily to Canada, not a direct visit to the United States. (2) The King can make official visits in any year of his reign, while the President has a limited term. (3) The US President has the dual roles of head of state and prime minister, and his duties do not allow him to leave his post lightly. However, if Roosevelt visits Europe in a private capacity after leaving office, he will of course be free to do so. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>United States Creates New Type of Reconnaissance Aircraft</h3>

Today, another incendiary bomb was found in a package sent to a senior official of Scotland Yard (i.e., police headquarters). According to experts' examination, this bomb was equipped with special components and was designed to explode when it reached the recipient. After receiving the report, the police immediately sent two detectives to the post office to check all mail sent to Buckingham Palace, the Prime Minister's residence, the Home Secretary's residence, and other departments.

<h3>Warsaw as the Center of Behind-the-Scenes European Diplomacy; Italy Attempts to Enlist Poland's Support for Colonial Demands; Talks Between Romania and Poland Attract Attention</h3>
<p>(London) According to Reuters, even in this seemingly quiet period, diplomatic activities are unavoidable, and they are not being overlooked simply because some of them are behind the scenes. In the view of various diplomatic correspondents, the international situation must wait until the Spanish war has been fully resolved and Mussolini has been able to express the extent of his demands on France before clear developments can occur. No one dares to make definitive predictions about the nature of these demands. However, some people believe that there are currently reasons to believe that the demands put forward by Mussolini will be primarily political, with land being secondary. Currently, the diplomatic activities that are attracting attention are concentrated in Warsaw. According to news from Rome, Gaeda, who is generally regarded as Mussolini's mouthpiece, recently accompanied Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to Poland and has now returned to Rome. According to his words, Poland will soon unite with Italy and Germany to form a tripartite front, making concrete demands for colonies. Gaeda suggested that major colonial powers should distribute their colonies to races that have the capacity for production, replacing the previous complete occupation with free trade guaranteed by products. At the same time, he also argued that countries with population growth should have colonies, because farmland in the vast world needs people to cultivate it. He also claimed that Italy, Germany, and Poland could supply what England and France could not supply in terms of agriculture and industry. After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano left Warsaw, Polish Foreign Minister Beck immediately shifted his attention to Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who recently led a delegation to Warsaw. According to a Warsaw correspondent for the Sunday Times, the main issues discussed by the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will be, on the one hand, the attitudes of the two countries towards the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, the possible expansion of Germany to the east. Other issues will be involved in considering the existing Polish-Romanian military alliance. This alliance has gradually cooled since the Munich Agreement, after King Carol of Romania refused to assist Poland's attempt to establish a common Polish border. It is now believed that King Carol of Romania has expressed regret for this attitude, having recognized that if Germany expands from Ruthenia, the seriousness of its threat will far outweigh the possible annexation of land by Hungary. It is heard that Gafencu's intention is to ascertain the Romanian side's views on this matter and to investigate the possibility of Poland and Romania jointly resisting German and Soviet attempts to invade the two countries by idealistic means. According to the correspondent, the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will further attempt to strengthen relations with the Soviet Union. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from Rome, the talks currently taking place in Warsaw between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu have aroused great attention in Romania. It is said that the results of these talks may completely change the attitudes of the countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe and adopt a broader policy of distancing themselves from German influence. It is said that the economic demands currently being made by Germany on the Danube region have been indirectly obstructed by Italy. This is why the Polish Foreign Minister warmly received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, while anti-German demonstrations were occurring simultaneously throughout Poland. It is confirmed that the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will discuss the Danube River issue. It is heard that in addition to providing special transportation convenience for Polish goods transported to the Black Sea and Danube ports, Romania will also grant Poland the free zone of Galati to compensate for the loss of Danzig-Gdynia benefits in the event of difficulties in the Polish Corridor. Furthermore, Beck may also try to make relations between Hungary and Romania more friendly. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Romania and Poland is a Factor for Peace; Colonel Beck Hosts a Banquet to Welcome the Romanian Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Warsaw After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here this morning, Foreign Minister Beck gave a speech in the evening, saying briefly, "We firmly believe that Poland and Romania have the power to survive. Although there are various changes in the international situation, our attitude is extremely calm and not at all pessimistic." Foreign Minister Gafencu replied that the two countries' determination to cooperate is an important factor. All other countries, regardless of size or distance, should take this factor into account and use it as support, as long as they strive for European peace and culture. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Czech and Slovak Peoples Grow More Hostile; Slovak People Want to Leave Czech and Become Independent</h3>
<p>Prague The mutual relations between the Czech and Slovak peoples within the Czech Federal Government have once again become an important issue. Some leaders of the Slovak people believe that the Slovak people can leave the Czech Republic and become independent. Their hostility to the Czech people is growing stronger. Recently, the German Vienna radio station has been broadcasting messages unfavorable to the Czech people in the Slovak language every day, which is said to be done by Slovak people. However, the economic situation of the Slovak Autonomous Province is not good. The provincial finances are insufficient to cover expenses, and there is a huge deficit. Although the central government has agreed to provide financial assistance, it requires Premier Tiso of the Slovak provincial government to publicly guarantee that he is willing to coexist in unity with the Czech people within the federal framework as a condition of exchange. The provincial government convened a meeting today to discuss this matter, but failed to make a decision and will continue to discuss it at a meeting tomorrow. Regarding this matter, those in charge believe that although Premier Tiso's attitude is moderate, the attitude of Cabinet Associate Seedor is difficult to grasp. Another faction, led by the director of propaganda, Mr. Maschu, clearly supports independence. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how this problem will be resolved. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Italian and French Military Officials Inspect North Africa</h3>
<p>(Rome) Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio recently inspected defenses in the North African colony of Libya, paying particular attention to fortifications at the border between Libya and French Tunisia. He has now returned to the capital and immediately met with Prime Minister Mussolini to submit a report. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) General Noguès, Governor-General of French Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of the garrison forces in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in North Africa, returned home to report on his duties a few days ago. He left for the port of Tunis in French Tunisia, North Africa, this evening, and will then proceed to the fortress areas in southern Tunisia to inspect defenses, before returning to Paris via Morocco to present a report to the Mediterranean Affairs Committee on the 21st of this month. (Military and political affairs in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia are under the jurisdiction of the various departments of the cabinet. The Mediterranean Affairs Committee is responsible for coordination among these departments.) It is noted that when Premier Daladier inspected the various territories of North Africa in early January, the North African Defense Committee met in Algiers. At that time, General Noguès, Commander of the Garrison in Tunisia, and General Bubignière, Commander of the Garrison in Algeria, attended the meeting. General Noguès' visit to Tunisia is being carried out in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison in North Africa. Those in informed circles say that this trip has no special significance.

<h3>Britain's Military Expansion Not Directed at Germany; Henderson Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson delivered a speech at the banquet of the newly established German-British Association last night, saying that someone in Berlin had expressed anxiety to him, wanting to know the guarantee that Britain's military equipment would not be used to attack Germany in the future. He was willing to reply with the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the Lower House and Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House that British military equipment was only used for defense. The British Foreign Secretary's statement in the Upper House that the British parties would never make an aggressive war and could not embrace the hope that the people could support a policy of aggressive war was particularly noteworthy. The British parties, politicians, and individuals only had to resist any threat that endangered their independence or the interests of their survival with force in self-defense. German leader Hitler stated on January 30 that cooperation between Britain and Germany was the world's fortune, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain also spoke on February 22 in agreement with this view of the German leader. He believed that nothing could enable the establishment of world peace more than this. Therefore, he hoped that the audience would work together to seek the realization of British-German cooperation. (Reuter, 4th)</p>
<p>Then, the President of the Association, Schroder, gave a reply, saying, "For the sake of improving relations between Britain and Germany, the two countries should recognize each other's rights." Tielks, a London banker among the guests, also expressed his views. His main point was that the upcoming British-German industrial talks could promote the improvement of international trade relations in Europe. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<h3>Britain Recruits Air Force Personnel; Young People Enlist Enthusiastically; 400,000 People Currently Registered for National Volunteer Service</h3>
<p>(London)</p>
<p>Sir Kingsley Wood, the Secretary of State for Air, announced in June of last year that the Air Force needed to recruit 31,000 officers and soldiers. The Ministry of Aviation has recently announced that the number of young people who have applied to enlist nationwide has exceeded the quota. However, because the British Air Force still needs to be expanded, recruitment will continue. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Home Secretary Anderson delivered a speech at a banquet of the Glasgow City Journalists Association last night, saying that the implementation of the National Volunteer Service plan was making great progress, which was gratifying. As of February 18, 400,000 people had registered with the authorities for voluntary service. However, it was regrettable that participation in fire brigades and ambulance teams was not very enthusiastic. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Franco Reaffirms Determination to Maintain Spanish Independence; Policies Not Manipulated by Germany and Italy; Former Enemies Willing to Become Friends Today</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Chronicle recently published an interview with General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, reaffirming his determination to maintain independence and not be manipulated by Germany and Italy. He said, "One thing that needs to be explained is that Germany and Italy have neither requested Spain to cede territory nor requested the establishment of military bases in the country. I have conducted negotiations with the authorities of these countries in order to sign agreements to ensure that Spain should be ruled by the Spanish themselves, and not allow an inch of land to be controlled by foreign countries. What the world should understand is that after victory, if one is isolated internationally without friendly countries, then this victory will still be empty. Based on this concept, we sincerely wish to obtain the sympathy and understanding of all countries in the world, especially Britain. As far as Spain itself is concerned, we are also willing to reconcile with those in the country who used to be our enemies. I would like to state to them that although we used to be like fire and water, the ideals we embraced were the same sincere patriotism, and there were many common points between them. In short, if the enemy of the past can become a friend of today, and cooperate with each other, then Spain will be able to regenerate itself and occupy an appropriate position in the international arena."

<h3>The Western Government Prepares to Continue the War of Resistance; the Army Begins Reorganization; the Premier Appoints Himself Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Madrid. Premier Negrín of the Republican government recently decided to reorganize the Central and Southern Army Groups, merging them into one. He appointed himself Supreme Commander, directly overseeing military operations above the current Commander-in-Chief, General Miaja, while authorizing the General Staff to issue orders. Premier Negrín has consistently insisted on resisting the war. He recently declared at a State Council meeting that the army must be strengthened, and a plan has been decided upon. He will stay in Alicante Province to personally implement it. His appointment as Supreme Commander further demonstrates his determination to resist the war. In addition, government soldiers aged 44 and 45 will be discharged to return to farming. All officers who have made meritorious contributions on the former front lines in Catalonia Province will be promoted to reward their achievements. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>After the Japanese Army Occupied Hefei, Commerce Has Come to a Standstill; Conflicts Occurred Within the Japanese Garrison</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the central Anhui region, containing parts of Anhui, Henan, and Hubei provinces, belongs to the Fifth Military District of the guerrilla forces under the command of the Chinese government. Three months ago, General Sun was ordered to pacify bandits in central Anhui and organize guerrilla units, commanding a portion of the Sixth Division guerrilla forces. General Sun's governance was effective, and now there is hardly any banditry in the rural areas. Farmers have returned to their homes, and the countryside is full of wheat. There is no opium planting in the areas managed by the Chinese army, so raw opium prices are quite high, about 26 yuan per tael. Last month, the two armies only fought three times. The railway was once demolished by guerrillas,</p>
<p>Blocking Transportation for several days. Two weeks ago, some Japanese soldiers stationed in Hefei launched an attack 20 li outside the city's southern suburbs. Fewer than 20 returned alive. On February 21, guerrillas attacked Hefei from three sides, firing at the city's guards. Although they retreated shortly after, it indicates that the Chinese guerrillas have made better preparations to drive the Japanese army out of central Anhui. Highways east from Hefei to the Jinpu Railway, west to Henan Province, and south to Anqing have all been destroyed by guerrillas to prevent the movement of the Japanese army's mechanized units. The guerrillas also cut off food supplies to Hefei, and prevent Japanese goods from being transported from Hefei to the countryside. Therefore, residents and sojourners in the city can only buy rice and vegetables from farmers in the area east of the city controlled by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Commerce in the city of Hefei has come to a standstill, but commerce is quite prosperous in the villages 20 li away from the city because the areas within 5 li of the city are controlled by guerrillas. The Japanese authorities in Hefei are eager for people to return to the city and resume business, but they are unable to achieve their goal because they are deeply afraid of the guerrillas and because of strict inspections at the city gates. From a financial point of view, the city is "only going out and not coming in." There is also friction within the Japanese authorities in Hefei because the people are poor and the revenue of the Japanese puppet regime is very small. They plan to set up brothels and gambling dens as</p>
<p>Methods of Raising Money, but they gave up due to the poverty of the people. However, there is some income from the sale of morphine and opium. Some people who fled to the countryside due to the war have not yet returned to the city. The objects and goods in their residences and shops have been plundered and sold by the puppet regime. The internal conflict between the local Japanese special affairs department and the military police arose from the money earned from the stolen goods. The military police, jealous of the special affairs department's profits, arrested the head of the special affairs department and imprisoned him. It has been a month now, and the military police are the only ones respected in the city. Even the military police guarding the city consider the passes previously issued by the special affairs department to be invalid, and passes must be obtained from the military police. At least in terms of national dignity, this kind of internal conflict should be kept secret, but it is said that they are talking about it to the Chinese at will. Therefore, the local people know the details of the conflict. The personnel of the various ruling groups of the Japanese army in the city have been repeatedly changed, and the mutual jealousy makes it very difficult for the local Chinese puppet organizations because they have to flatter a certain major Japanese official, but they cannot determine which Japanese official can stay in office the longest. If they choose the wrong person, they will perish on their own. Therefore, the puppet organizations are quite uneasy. The actions of the various puppets are only to listen to the Japanese and search for wealth from the poor civilians.</p>
<h3>White Clouds Rise Above the Steep Cliffs, Mountains and Plains Enter Western Sichuan (Continued); Carrying Sedan Chairs to Climb the Ridges on Rugged Roads; Crossing the Iron Chain Bridge on the Luding River</h3>
<p>Climbing Over Mountains</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, we set off from Huntou and headed west along the mountain road. The places we passed were bare and barren, with very little vegetation. Occasionally, we saw people living on the slopes on both sides, with cooking smoke rising. Those living at the highest points were almost on the peaks. After traveling 15 li, we arrived at Sanjiao Ping, where we had a simple meal. Continuing forward, we reached Linkou, at the foot of the Feiyueling Mountain. Patches of snow accumulated at the higher elevations, and the climate gradually became colder. The height of Feiyueling is 3,600 meters above sea level. The locals call it Crow Ridge because many crows live on the ridge. As the name suggests, its treacherousness is evident. Although the height of the mountain is not as high as Daxueling, its steep slopes and difficult terrain seem to surpass it. Starting from Linkou, we climbed up the steps, gradually ascending higher and higher. The strange rocks were jagged and extremely difficult to climb. Although the ravines in the mountains were deep, the flow was not as unrestrained as the mountain streams of Daxueling. The reporter rode in a sedan chair straight up, but after only two or three li, the bearers were unable to cope. So I got down and put on straw sandals, holding a wooden stick, and climbed up the chaotic stone path, stooping over. By the time we reached Fulong Temple, we were already panting. Thinking of the difficulty of the Shu Road, it is truly harder than climbing to the blue sky. So we sat on a stone to rest and then went to visit the temple. We learned that the temple was built in the Yuan Dynasty, but due to years of disrepair, the temple has collapsed. A statue of a god in the middle was lying on a stone base, and the idols on both sides were also missing limbs and ears, dilapidated and unbearable. Then, mustering courage, we moved forward. The mountain path became steeper, forming a steep slope. Because the reporter was relatively fat, climbing was not easy. At this time, sweat was pouring down, my shirt was completely wet, my breath was short, my heart was pounding, my blood vessels were tense, and I almost felt dizzy and nauseous. Seeing this, my companions urged me to rest, fearing that something unexpected would happen. The bearers were afraid of an accident, so they carried me up again. At this time, the crows on the top of the mountain were croaking sadly, as if pitying our hard work. I remembered the ancient poem about Crow Pass: "Going up Crow Pass in the morning, going down Crow Pass in the evening, crows croaking hoarsely, the travelers have not yet returned." Whether it was written for this ridge, riding in a sedan chair only traveled a little more than a li, and the bearers could not support it because they had not had their opium fix. The reporter got down and walked again. After walking about three li, we finally reached the summit. I was exhausted and could hardly move. After resting for a while, I looked around. The snow, fog, and clouds were boundless. The peaks opposite were all in a hazy fog, and there was no way to recognize their true appearance. It seemed that I was already in the white clouds. There was a patrol post at the top of the mountain, with four or five armed soldiers roasting a fire inside. They stared at the reporter when I arrived, but did not ask where I came from. There was a small stone niche next to the post, with a newly made stone statue inside, but I did not know which god it was. From here, we went down the slope, but the stone path was wet and slippery, making it difficult to walk. The reporter had just boarded the sedan chair when, after less than half a li, one of the bearers in front suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. The reporter got down and walked again. After walking 15 li, we arrived at Hualinping. It was 3:00 PM. The town was in the middle of the mountain slopes, and the market was extremely desolate. We originally planned to stay here, but everyone suggested continuing on. So we moved forward again, walking on the cliffs, along the mountain path. The mountains on both sides were continuous, with deep ravines in between. The water flowed like thunder. We were always worried about falling. The human habitation gradually became sparse along the way, as we had already entered Luding County. At 5:30 PM, we arrived at Xinglongbao and stopped to stay overnight.</p>
<p>Deep into the Wilderness</p>
<p>Xinglongbao is under the jurisdiction of Luding County, a small market town in the valley. The market is deserted, with only a few restaurants and small inns. There is a small elementary school in the town, with few students and simple equipment. We stayed here overnight. On the morning of the 24th, we left the fort and headed northwest. The sun was warm and gentle, as warm as spring. On both sides were bare mountains, meandering through the desolate smoke and withered grass. The sand on the road was thick, flying in the wind, as if traveling in a desert. We had already gone deep into the wilderness. As we moved forward, we met several Miao people coming from the opposite direction, driving pack animals loaded with goods. One person was chanting non-stop, as the Kang people believe in Buddhism and recite scriptures while walking, sitting, and lying down. The sedan chair bearers hired by the reporter had been out of the pass several times and knew a little of the Kang language. They repeatedly said "Hamo Guo" and laughed at them. "Hamo Guo" means "I don't understand" in Chinese. Continuing forward, we climbed several steep mountain roads. In the mountains, we glimpsed the ravines gradually widening, and the water flowing rapidly, seemingly forming a river. Asking the bearers, we learned that it was the lower reaches of the Dadu River. Turning around a mountain pass, we saw a waterfall cascading down between two peaks, and we realized why the water was so rapid. After traveling 10 li, we arrived at Lengqi. The market was clean, and the streets were paved with lime and tung oil, quite like asphalt roads. There was an elementary school in the city, with many anti-war slogans posted. We had a simple meal here. We heard that last autumn, the town was destroyed by a fire, with 30% of the houses burned down. They are now actively rebuilding, and will soon restore its original appearance. From here, the mountain road goes up and down, winding and rugged. Looking at the high peaks in the distance, inserted into the clouds, the momentum is very dangerous. The fields below the mountain are connected, green in patches, contrasting with the wild grass on the mountain, quite different. There are many cacti along the road, with thick branches and leaves, very different from those planted in gardens in the interior. Walking to a dangerous rock, we saw a huge stone carved with a god statue. The local people carrying goods were burning incense and worshipping. At 12:00, we arrived at Luding County. Looking at the foot of the mountain in the distance, there was a foreign-style house, seemingly a church building. We entered the east gate, which had the four large characters "No Different from the Heavenly Palace." Entering the city, it was desolate, with gravel on the road. We rested in the Qiaodong Street and had lunch. After lunch, we went to visit the iron chain bridge.</p>
<p>Crossing the Iron Chain Bridge</p>
<p>Luding is located southeast of Kangding, occupying the Dadu River as the main route into Kang. In the fortieth year of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, the Tibetans rebelled. The Qing army went south and, after pacifying Dajianlu, built the Luding Bridge on the river. The iron chains at both ends were planted on huge rocks, and the railing pillars were made of iron. It was 13 zhang long and 9 chi wide, with a total of nine chains, covered with boards for people to walk on. There is a stele on the side of the bridge erected during the Kangxi period, with an inscription written by the Qing Emperor Shengzu, describing in detail the events of pacifying the rebellion and building the bridge. The Western Sichuan government sends people every three years to repair it. This stele still exists today. There is a newly erected stele east of the bridge, inscribed with the four large characters "Ancient Luding Bridge" by Chairman Liu Wenhui. The Luding Pass is located here, with a barrier set up, and dedicated personnel to manage the opening and closing. When the reporter went to visit, he saw this bridge spanning the river like a long rainbow, towering over dangerous cliffs and overlooking deep ravines. The water flowed rapidly, angrily churning up snow waves. Based on the experience of crossing the iron chain bridge in Rongjing the other day, when I almost fainted, I instructed the sedan chair bearers to support me while crossing, but the chains were still swaying softly. Looking down at the raging waves, I was quite apprehensive. Walking to the west end, my companions looked at me and smiled. Usually, this bridge is given a small repair every three years and a major repair every five years. It is said that a certain army entered Kang several years ago, and many soldiers drowned because they were rushing to cross, and the chains were broken. In recent years, the authorities have added special restrictions on crossing the bridge. All cattle, horses, and heavy goods are prohibited from passing, and only people are allowed to walk. After the reporter crossed the iron chain bridge, he saw a wooden boat in the river north of the bridge, carrying livestock. At this time, we walked westward along the mountain slope, the slope suddenly steep and slow. As we walked, we were suddenly fast and slow. We glimpsed smoke rising in the mountain pass, burning dry grass, probably people setting wildfires. When we passed Zali, the setting sun cast a touch of afterglow on the sparse forest. Soon, the chaotic mountains closed in, making us feel even more desolate. Looking west, a crescent moon was hanging on the top of the mountain. Remembering Su Zizhan's famous lines "The mountains are high, the moon is small, the water recedes, and the rocks appear," I felt that this scene was vaguely similar. When we arrived at Pengta, it was already dusk. We stayed here that night.</p>
<h3>Worthy of Attention: The Paper Industry in Zhejiang Province (3); the Authorities Should Urgently Invest and Encourage Development; Eliminate Old Methods and Genuinely Reform; Travel Correspondence from Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>In the villages I passed through, I saw paper-making households everywhere, with dozens or more than a hundred households in each county. However, the equipment was extremely simple. These paper mills are mostly located beside mountain streams, using water power to drive wooden wheels to move wooden stakes to crush bamboo pulp for manufacturing. I saw women and children doing this work along the way.</p>
<p>Raw Materials for Paper</p>
<p>Paper making is a major handicraft industry in eastern Zhejiang, so I carefully investigated it. There are many varieties of paper produced in eastern Zhejiang, such as Nanping, Huajian, Yuanshu, Luming, Fanggao, Haifang, Jingfang, and dozens of others. But they can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) Yellow-white paper, (2) Yellow burnt paper, (3) Straw paper, (4) Bark paper. Yellow-white paper is mostly used for writing, burnt paper is used for superstitious purposes, and bark paper is used for umbrellas, packaging, and miscellaneous purposes. The manufacturing methods of various papers are also different, but the general procedure is that the paper mill hires workers to cut down the new bamboo with fine and soft fibers, drag it down the mountain, and saw it into short poles of two chi to five cun. The bamboo green (ie, the epidermis) is separated from the inner flesh. The bamboo flesh has fine and long fibers, which are suitable for making white paper, while the bamboo green is coarse and brittle and is retained for making yellow paper. After the bamboo is cut into sections and the green is scraped off, it is crushed. This work is laborious, so it is done by women and children. After the bamboo material is crushed, it is dried in the sun and then immersed in a water tank. The length of time depends on the age of the bamboo material. After six or seven days, lime slurry is mixed with the bamboo pulp. This method of pickling the slurry involves piling the lime and bamboo material together. It can be pickled in about a month. Then it is steamed, usually for five days. After steaming, it is placed in the stream to wash away the lime and placed in a rotten material pond. After another ten days, it can be softened and rotten into a ripe material. After the raw material is made, it is again crushed into fine material by water power and stored in a material bucket for manufacturing. When making paper, the fine material is injected into the paper trough, mixed with vegetable glue and a little water. It is stirred with a bamboo pole. After it is uniform and pure, the paper curtain is placed in it, and it is copied into pages of paper by hand, placed flat on the bottom plate, squeezed out the water, and baked in the room to make it.</p>
<p>Should Seek Improvement</p>
<p>China is in a state of war today. Strengthening the total economic output of the people across the country is an important priority at the moment. To obtain large-scale production, industry is certainly important, but promoting handicraft production, in terms of its efficiency, is equivalent to large enterprises. Therefore, we should also pay attention to the paper-making industry in eastern Zhejiang, which is an important handicraft industry today. Because the annual paper production in eastern Zhejiang is very large, and most of it is exported to other provinces, but due to the following reasons, it cannot be fully developed: (1) Most of the paper produced is used for superstitious purposes. (2) The paper mills are all run by farmers in their spare time and by women and children, so they stick to old methods and do not know how to improve. (3) The materials taken by the mills are inconsistent, and the manufacturing methods are different, resulting in substandard and poor-quality products. (4) There is no sufficient capital, so the tools are simple and cannot be mass-produced. According to my observation, if the paper industry in eastern Zhejiang today can be reorganized and improved, it will be of great benefit to our country. To improve it, the best method is to strictly prohibit the manufacture of superstitious paper. The local government should be responsible for guiding the mills to improve tools and equipment and to unify and improve manufacturing methods so that the products can be standardized and of good quality. And the authorities should actively raise funds, loan them to the mills, to expand and improve all their facilities, and to make full use of this natural raw material and the surplus labor of the farmers, and to seek an increase in quality and quantity to meet the current needs.</p>
<p>Today, in Xi'an and Sichuan and other places, earthen paper is used to replace newsprint to print newspapers, to reduce the outflow of state funds. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. If the earthen paper can be improved in today, so that it can be used for printing, then a huge amount of capital outflow can be reduced every year. This assistance will be of great benefit to the wartime economy.</p>
<h3>The Rugao Self-Defense Force Recaptures Dongchen Town; the Japanese Army in Yangzhou Is Panicked</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Rugao Chinese Army Self-Defense Force attacked the Japanese army in Dongchen Town on the 22nd. The two sides came into contact. By 9:00 AM, the Japanese army was unable to resist and retreated to Rugao. Later, at 12:00, more than 100 Japanese reinforcements came from Rugao and engaged the Self-Defense Force again. The fighting stopped at 3:00 PM. As a result, because the Self-Defense Force fought valiantly, Dongchen Town was recaptured. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Only one or two members of the Self-Defense Force were injured.</p>
<p>Gui Ban, the commander of the Japanese army in Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, went to Xishan on the 23rd to command military affairs, strictly preventing the Chinese army from counterattacking. At the same time, he attempted to attack Yong'an Town. On the 24th, he forcibly dragged dozens of people to build a fort in front of the Japanese army headquarters in Xiannvmiao. Now, the Japanese army has also set up the Jiangbei Garrison Headquarters in Wang Boling's residence in Xiama Mountain, Yangzhou. The military police have moved to the Zhong residence on Xinma Road. The puppet opium prohibition bureau is located in the Zuowei Street Central Bank. Five hundred Japanese and puppet troops are stationed at the two departments of the provincial Yangzhong Middle School.</p>
<h3>Public Prostitution Is Implemented in Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: Since the Lunar New Year, the scene inside the city has been bleak, and mobile teams are also everywhere. He Peixuan, the puppet magistrate, and Bian Shang, the puppet police chief, have both received warning letters with drawings of human heads, urging them to wake up. Bian Shang, the puppet police chief, recently registered prostitutes in order to increase his income. Public prostitution has been implemented since then.</p>

<h3>Sports News: Charitable Football Brings Thunderous Cheers; Lido Defeats the Army United 2-3; Leading Two to Zero in the First Half; Aquin Performs Excellently; Pu Zaiyuan Matches Gao Jun; the Game Ball Is Purchased for 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>The second charitable football tournament organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, Lido vs. the Army United, was held at Yiyuan yesterday morning at 10:30. It was expected to rain heavily. Although it cleared up yesterday morning, it reduced the number of spectators, leaving a third of the seats empty in the five-cornered stand. In total, there were less than 10,000 people. As a result of the fierce battle, Lido's strength was abundant. Although Sun Jinshun was unable to play due to illness, they still scored two goals in the first half. In the end, they won three to two. Both goals scored by the Army United were penalty kicks. The Army United is based on West Foss, which has maintained an undefeated record in the A League, supplemented by Jiele and Hailiesun from East Celai. Lido defeated them in one fell swoop, earning a lot of glory for the Chinese team. Mr. Yu Qiaqing was six minutes late yesterday morning and did not have time to preside over the opening ceremony. However, during the halftime break, he personally presented the football from the previous match between the Chinese League and the Western League, which was purchased by Mr. Gao Huaide for 400 yuan. The ball used in yesterday's game was auctioned off by Mr. Pu Zaiyuan for 500 yuan.</p>

<p>The 30-piece orchestra led by Tang Qiaosi played the national anthem, and the charity match began. Mr. Yu was one step late and did not have time to kick off. Lido attacked first. The field was muddy like a swamp, making it difficult to run. Li Yichen advanced sharply and passed to Cao Qiuting. Qiuting sent it to the center, Li and Xu made a double feint, and Zhang Mingsheng rushed up and kicked it diagonally out of the field, which was a pity. The Army United counterattacked. Dengken took a corner kick, and Tangmusen headed it too high. The offensive was still controlled by Lido. After a stalemate for 23 minutes, Xu Wenkui finally broke through alone, using Yichen's smoke screen, and pulled his foot from 20 yards away to shoot fiercely. Although Aigensun caught it with both hands, it still slipped into the net due to the strong momentum. Lido opened the scoring. The Army United launched a fierce counterattack. Tangmusen shot, but was shoveled diagonally out by Meng Yiliang. Soon, Maikelong passed two players in a row, and Tangmusen shot into an empty goal. Lu Yituo turned it into a corner kick. Then, Zhang Mingsheng dribbled the ball deep and crossed it. Yichen ferried it, and Wang Kehou kicked it into the goal. Two to zero. Only four minutes had passed since the first goal, and the crowd cheered wildly. The Army United tried desperately. There were two dangerous situations in front of Lido's goal. The Army United's five forwards advanced in a single line. Folaise shot low, Chang Lu caught it and slipped, holding it on the ground. Maitangna pushed the ball into the goal from his arms, but it was not counted as a foul. In the first half, Lido won by two goals.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Presides Over the Ball Presentation Ceremony</p>
<p>During lemon time, Li Guiyong reported the total ticket revenue from the previous match between the Chinese League and the Western League through a loudspeaker and invited Mr. Yu to preside over the ball presentation ceremony. Mr. Yu personally presented the ball used in the previous match to Mr. Gao Huaide, a director of the Lido Sports Association, for safekeeping. The audience applauded thunderously. The ball was specially equipped with a chrome-plated base, and the surface of the ball was stamped with gold letters, which read "January 8, Republic of China, Shanghai International Relief Committee, Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, invited the Chinese League team and the Western League team to hold a charitable football match at Yiyuan. Mr. Gao Huaide generously spent a large sum of money to buy the ball to help the needy. This inscription is to commemorate his kindness and righteousness." Below was Yu Qiaqing's autograph. After the ceremony, Tang Qiaosi's band began to play, and Tang sang a section of the Lido Sports Club song, with extremely heroic tones.</p>
<p>Penalty Kicks Occur Again and Again</p>
<p>The game resumed, and the situation gradually stabilized. The Army United's offensive gradually became fierce. Dengken rushed in, and Lu shoveled it out. Tangmusen shot, Chang Lu caught it head-on. Li Yichen spotted a loophole, avoided Jiele, and handed it to Qiuting, who was just about to shoot, but he and Kehou let each other, and the opportunity was lost, which was a pity. The Army United shot three times, but all were blocked. Shi Meili took a free kick in the middle of the field, Folaise shot diagonally, Chang Lu chased, and Luosi rushed up diagonally and kicked it. Fortunately, it was saved by Lu. At 23 minutes, Maitangna rushed in, Xin Fuzhen accidentally bumped into him, and a penalty kick was awarded. Tangmusen kicked it, but there was no way to turn the tide, making it two to one. Lido counterattacked, Qiuting cut into the center, and Wenkui drew his bow, but it was caught by Aigensun. Unexpectedly, the defense was in trouble again. Tangmusen shot, and Lingen hooked it, hitting the crossbar and bouncing back. Lu turned it into a corner kick. After Tang kicked it out, Wang Kehou was heading it for rescue when he was penalized for a penalty kick again. Tangmusen tied the score at two each. It was 27 minutes.</p>
<p>Xu Wenkui Establishes the Victory</p>
<p>At 29 minutes, Xu Wenkui broke through Shi Meili and Hai Daoxun in a row, and then flicked over Aigensun, scoring in one fell swoop. Lido regained the lead with three to two, and the overall situation was also established. Order booklets and hats flew from the north and south stands, and the audience cheered wildly. In the last 15 minutes, the Army United's attack became even fiercer, and the situation became more and more tense. Luosi shot, and Dengken followed with a fierce shot, hitting the post and bouncing back, extremely dangerous. Jiele took a free kick, Chang Lu knelt down and slipped, Folaisai and Maitangna rushed forward side by side. Fortunately, Chang Lu quickly blocked it. The Army United's five forwards shot in succession, but Lu saved them all. Soon, the final whistle sounded, and Lido defeated the Army United by three to two.</p>
<p>Pu Zaiyuan Generously Contributes</p>
<p>After the game, the game ball was auctioned off by Li Guiyong and Xi Yushu. Starting at 200 yuan, Mr. Gao Huaide increased it to 450 yuan. Finally, Mr. Pu Zaiyuan, general manager of the Putian Road Pu Zaiji Cleaning Bureau, won it for the highest price of 500 yuan. Amid the thunderous applause of all eyes focused, he stepped down the steps at the invitation of the International Relief Committee and took a group photo with Mr. Yu and others to commemorate the event. It is said that the ticket revenue yesterday totaled more than 2,200 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Shanghai Student Tennis Team's Expedition to Hong Kong and Macau (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Fourth Match Against Macau</p>
<p>The team traveled to Macau on the 8th for their fourth expedition match against the Macau representative team. Li Guofan played the first singles match and decisively defeated Miro with a score of 6-4, 6-0. In the second singles match, Tang Jiaze underperformed and lost to Liao Yifang with a score of 4-6, 5-7. Cai Guoji won the third singles match against Fei with a score of 7-5, 7-5. The Shanghai team won both doubles matches, resulting in an overall victory of four to one. After the match, Li Guofan and Liao Yifang played an exhibition match, which Li won easily in straight sets. According to reports, Liao is a good player in Macau, but his skills are not superior to Tang. Tang's defeat resulted in Shanghai losing the opportunity for a clean sweep. The Shanghai team received a grand reception in Macau, and they returned to Hong Kong that evening.</p>
<p>Fifth Match Against Kowloon</p>
<p>The fifth match was against the Kowloon Cricket Club, held on the 9th at the club's court. In the first singles match, Li Guofan faced the club champion, Gassett. Li's powerful serves and diagonal long shots made it difficult for Gassett to defend. However, Gassett's performance that day was far below his usual standard. In the second singles match, Tang Baojia played more calmly than in previous matches and was able to defeat his opponent. Cai Guoji lost to Fincham in the third singles match. In the first doubles match, Li and Tang faced Fincham and Crawford. Li and Tang won the first set 7-5, but the second set was stopped due to darkness at 8-8. In the second doubles match, Wei and Xu initially won the first set against Kelly and Diener, but then lost the next two sets. However, Kelly's serve had exhausted his energy.</p>
<p>Sixth Match Against the Chinese Athletic Association</p>
<p>The sixth match was against the Chinese Athletic Association on the afternoon of the 11th at the association's court in Causeway Bay. The Chinese Athletic Association boasts Xu Wei Pei, Run Pei Kun brothers, and veterans Jiang Daozhang and Li Huitang, making them a strong team that dominates Hong Kong. Da Xu was even selected as our country's representative for the Taiwan Cup. Tang, of course, was outmatched. Since Li Guofan had no hope of winning against Da Xu either, he played the second singles match against Li Huitang. Guofan played cautiously and won both sets. Cai Guoji lost to Li Rurong in the third singles match.</p>
<p>The first doubles match between Li and Tang against Xiao Xu and Jiang Daozhang was one of the most exciting scenes of the entire match. In the first set, Li and Tang initially fell behind 1-5 but rallied to win 9-7. Xu and Jiang won the second set 6-4. In the third set, Li and Tang led all the way, but Baojia missed five "match points" in a row, resulting in a 9-11 loss. The Shanghai team also lost the second doubles match.</p>
<p>Seventh Match Against the Indians</p>
<p>The final match was on the afternoon of the 12th against the Sukanpoh Indian Recreation Club. The Shanghai team was tired and fatigued after several days of competition. In addition, their opponents, the Lun brothers, are considered top players in Hong Kong, resulting in a two-to-three defeat. Li Guofan played against Da Lun, but his spirit was low and he lost 0-2. Tang Baojia also lost to Xiao Lun. Wei Zhenxing easily defeated Omarling with a score of 6-1, 6-0. In the mixed doubles, Li and Tang cooperated well and defeated Xiao Lun and Mata with a score of 6-3, 6-3. Wei and Cai fought fiercely against Da Lun and Omarling, but Wei and Cai lacked endurance, allowing their opponents to prevail.</p>
<p>Li Guofan's Reflections</p>
<p>The team stayed in Hong Kong for a total of eighteen days, resting for only two days. They played seven matches, winning four and losing three, for a total of thirty-two games, winning eighteen and losing fourteen. Li Guofan was the most impressive performer in the exhibition matches. In the singles matches, he won all five except for the loss to Da Lun. Tang and Chen Zhiqiang Liao Yifang were also defeated by him in the exhibition games by 2-1 and 2-0 respectively. Tang always played doubles with Xiao Tang, and they only lost one of the seven matches to the Yu Run Jiang Daozhang team. Tang Maijia was not as fierce as usual, lacking confidence and appearing flustered, resulting in four losses. His performance in the mixed doubles was also not as good as in Shanghai. According to Li Guofan, the tennis level in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai. There are numerous clubs there, and the courts are provided free of charge by the government. Rackets and tennis balls are also cheaper, so the burden on players is lighter. The mild climate is suitable for training year-round, leading to greater improvements in skills. Both Chinese and Western players in Hong Kong excel in doubles over singles. This competition against famous players in Hong Kong and Macau was very beneficial. They gained a lot of experience and received enthusiastic hospitality and encouragement from all sides. They are especially grateful to He Jiaqiu for arranging the competition schedule. (The End)</p>

<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the Refugee Production Education Fund Raising Association Resolves to Amend School Award Measures and Organize a Production Education Design Committee</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recognizing the importance of refugee production education, has vigorously promoted the "Le Shan Zhang" (Charity Badge) fundraising campaign. Schools have been enthusiastically registering with the Shanghai Bank to claim the Le Shan Zhang. Although the campaign has only been implemented for a short time, it has already reached the expected number, demonstrating the attention of all sectors of society to refugee production education. In order to promote the realization of refugee production education and to ensure the complete success of the fundraising work, the Association held a Standing Committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at its office on the third floor of 93 Guangdong Road. Dozens of people attended, including Zhang Zhonghuan, Du Zuozhou, Liu Chongben, Li Hongshou, Xu Zexiang, Sun Yucai, Lin Buqi, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Rongzhen, Zhong Yiming, Xie Xiangzhi, Yao Huiquan, Liang Zhongyuan, Sun Xiaolou, Zhou Zefu, Mao Derun, Chen Qingshi, Huang Zhongsu, Shen Xibin, and Tang Guoxun. Chairman Xi Wangshu presided over the meeting, and several proposals were discussed. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Award Measures Regarding Article 2 of the Group's Award Measures, which stipulates that a school whose students donate Le Shan Zhang exceeding half of the total number of students will be awarded a "Le Shan" certificate by the Association. This was previously advocated by the majority at the meeting of principals at all levels. This time, the Education Group's fundraising participation includes schools at all levels, including universities, specialized schools, middle schools, vocational schools, supplementary schools, and elementary schools. When awarding certificates, it should be calculated separately. For example, if a school has a university department, a middle school department, and a supplementary school, it should be treated as three units. For another example, if a supplementary school has seven branches, each branch should be treated as one unit. Furthermore, the ranking awards in Articles 2 and 4 of the Award Measures should also be calculated according to each unit of each school to ensure fairness and encourage participation. How should this be decided? It is specially proposed for a public decision. Resolved: (1) For schools with departments at all levels, or with multiple branches, the fundraising results should be calculated separately for each unit according to the proposed method. (2) The form of the certificate should include a drawing of a Le Shan Zhang in the center, with the word "Certificate" written beside it. The certificate should also specify whether it is graded as A, B, or C. As for the style of the frame and the silver quality, as well as the inscriptions, the Association's president and vice president are requested to prepare them in advance and pass them at the next meeting. (3) If someone donates a whole number of funds to the Association, Le Shan Zhang should also be issued. However, they must be issued at the end of the Group's fundraising work.</p>
<p>Production Plan The production education plan needs study in the process of escape in the fundraising work. This Association should formulate a detailed and complete plan to publish to the society, so that people of the society sympathize with the profound production education, and the purpose of this Association has a good effect. This plan is said to be under research by the Association's post-disaster relief department. This Association should organize a design committee to specialize in planning work, on the one hand, collect the existing production education work, and on the other hand, publish in newspapers to broadly seek opinions and plans from all walks of life, so as to gather opinions and expect results. It was resolved that the design committee would be established and research the plan at the next Standing Committee meeting, as proposed.</p>
<p>Recognition Situation Since the recognition of the Le Shan Zhang, the fundraising of the schools has been effective. A statistic has been added, as of today, there are a total of 198 elementary schools, with more than 23,700 registrations, 109 secondary schools, with more than 36,050 registrations, 27 colleges and specialized schools, with more than 11,300 registrations, 22 church schools, with more than 11,300 registrations, 12 Bureau of Public Works schools, with more than 10,000 registrations, 14 supplementary schools, with more than 9,700 registrations, for a total of more than 102,000 registrations. In addition, there are more than 5,000 yuan for those who automatically or directly add badges with cash to the bank, such as more than 20 schools such as Chongshi Elementary School, which are not included. (According to this statistical table, in the university department, Shanghai University is the most, secondary schools are the most by McTyeire School, Bureau of Public Works Girls' High School, Shanghai Girls' High School, and Kunfan Girls' High School, supplementary schools are the most by the Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School and Lixin Accounting Supplementary School, and elementary schools are the most by Juemin, Cunde, Tonghui, and Ningbo Shanghai Elementary School.) In this situation, the work has only been carried out for four days, and the results are already satisfactory. There are still six days, and it is hoped that the school authorities will make persistent efforts and work hard to raise funds, and the results should be more considerable. However, after detailed inspection of the statistical table, there are still many schools that have not registered, and there are even many schools that have registered, but the number is very small. From this point of view, the tomb work of this group cannot be considered satisfactory, it is appropriate to raise funds, it was resolved to step up fundraising, and each of the schools that have not received and received less are selected one by one, and each group of standing committee members will persuade them with sincerity, and on the one hand, this association will send a special letter to urge them.</p>
<p>Other Matters (1) This Association has published two special issues in the Shen Bao on February 23 and March 1, and it has now been decided to borrow the position of the Popular Weekly this month (Monday) to publish a special issue on the Education Group's fundraising. Please send the manuscripts directly to Mr. Ma Suogan of the Shen Bao for processing. (2) The painting advertisement in the Shen Bao has been sponsored by someone to donate to Deng Deng for three days, and now I want to publish three days in the News, and the advertising fee will be borne by the directors of this group to reduce the expenses of this group. (3) Director Xi reported that Mr. Yang Meinan transferred 1,000 yuan from the souvenir funds of Taikoo 洋行 to assist the Association, and a thank you has been issued. Yu Qiaqing, chairman of this group, praised the Association's work for being exceptionally hardworking and effective, and specially donated 1,000 yuan to encourage it. (4) The fundraising situation of this Association has been contacted with the Amusement Broadcasting Group, and each radio station will publicize it every day on its behalf. (5) The next Standing Committee of this Association will be held at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month (Tuesday), and will be convened again at the original location, and then the meeting will be adjourned.</p>
<p>Guoguang Middle School Organizes a Le Shan Zhang Competition Private Guoguang Middle School not only strictly manages and educates students, but also pays great attention to social relief undertakings. The school recently assisted the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association in donating and selling Le Shan Zhang. The extracurricular activities guidance committee of the school initiated the organization of a competition method for donation and sale. Those students who donate and sell the most of this Le Shan Zhang will be awarded a small Le Shan silver cup as a reward. After three days of competition among all teachers and students, the total number of donations and sales reached more than 1,000 pieces. The best personal results were achieved by Hong Zhixin and Xu Dingkang in the second year of junior high school, and they each won a Le Shan cup. These students are able to do their best for the pleasure of doing good and benefit the refugees.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Education Reform: Some Problems Concerning the Reform of the National Language Subject (3)</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>(3) Regarding grammar, rhetoric, sentence structure, and expression methods in textbooks, detailed discussions should be carried out, and ancient and modern texts should be compared as much as possible. Compare articles with spoken language, compare articles with the same subject matter but different styles, and compare articles of the same nature but with different writing methods. At the same time, students should be taught to add circles and dots to famous quotes and excellent sentences to cultivate their ability to discern and appreciate. Students should be taught to write short sentences, summarize the main points, and express their feelings in the margins of each paragraph and at the end of the article (or in a separate notebook) to cultivate their thinking ability. In addition, typical characters and events should be analyzed at any time. For example, the "Fisherman" in the Songs of Chu is written about three kinds of people: one is the drunk and turbid crowd in the world, one is Qu Yuan who refuses to go with the flow, and one is the fisherman who seizes the opportunity to make profits at any time. This is the same as Lu Xun's "The Clever Man, the Fool, and the Slave" and his discussion in the fourth section of "Half Summer Collection" about the traitors, hermits, and martyrs after the fall of the Ming Dynasty. Although the writing methods are different, the image or character of the three typical characters they write is the same. When teaching, not only should the expression techniques of these three texts be compared and studied, but also the three typical characters should be analyzed and criticized. Later, Chu Chuan Baicun's "Idiot" can be taught, which is the same type of righteous person as a "martyr", "fool" and "Qu Yuan", so as to encourage scholars to rely on the truth, be serious and brave, and seek welfare for the nation, the country, society and the people. Now let's talk about the writing exercises of scholars.</p>
<p>(4) Composition is usually once a week or twice every three weeks in junior high school, and once every two weeks in high school. I think it is better to read more than to write more, because scholars' writing is clumsy. After writing more, it will become a habit, which will be harmful and unhelpful. Therefore, composition in junior high school can also be prescribed once every two weeks, and the composition time of another week can be replaced by discussion, sentence correction, recitation, dictation, etc. The composition topics should be within the scholars' experience and knowledge. Composition revision should add more marks and marginal notes, and the overall evaluation must be practical. Unnecessary old-fashioned comments are unnecessary. In each semester, you can submit several compositions, only review but not revise, and return them to the scholars for self-correction. After re-transcription, submit them to the teacher for detailed revision, which is easier to improve. Individual guidance when issuing papers is also very important, which can make scholars pay more attention to and understand their writing shortcomings and correction methods, and be more careful in the next composition. As for the common mistakes made by the students, they should be publicly discussed and corrected after the papers are issued. Some national language teachers ask others to revise the composition, which is not in line with the teaching principles.</p>
<p>(5) Reading notes can be prescribed to be submitted once a month, with equal emphasis on internal teaching materials and extracurricular reading. The purpose is not only to make scholars know more new words, understand more difficult sentences, and read more good books, but also to train scholars in thinking organization, logical deduction, and writing habits. Therefore, in addition to annotating new words and difficult sentences and recording famous quotes, it is also necessary to extract the outline and main idea of the article or book and thoughts after reading.</p>
<p>(6) Weekly diaries are mostly used with the printed item format. This is really too rigid. Sometimes scholars have many events to record, but because the space is limited, the writing is very cramped, or it is done hastily. Sometimes scholars have nothing to say, but because the items are printed, they have to embellish it, so it becomes hypocritical and perfunctory. Therefore, it is better not to print the item format on the weekly diary book. However, some weekly diary items and practices can be printed on the book to remind scholars. In fact, it seems more reasonable and practical to change the weekly diary item to a life diary and submit it to the teacher for review after writing a general check at the end of each month.</p>
<p>(7) The achievements of the above items, all of which are good, are announced from time to time for public imitation and reference, and to arouse the academic competition among students. Other extracurricular assignments—such as publishing wall newspapers, printed materials, and composition competitions—should be encouraged, guided, and held as much as possible. In addition, I think that each grade should have one hour of weekly meeting time, during which the national language teacher guides scholars to hold meetings to discuss speeches, debates, and other matters, so as to harmonize the mutual feelings among students, train students in civic knowledge, enhance students' academic thoughts, especially develop students' speaking ability, which is closely related to language and literature.</p>
<p>(8) Finally, national language exams (excluding composition) should not only give mechanical questions—such as dictation, explanation, translation, filling in words, correcting errors, etc. This makes it easy to cultivate scholars' habit of studying books by rote. Special emphasis should be placed on more flexible questions—such as describing the main idea and feelings of a certain lesson, and asking questions from an entire unit—so as to force scholars to painstakingly solve the teaching materials they read and seek thorough understanding. After teaching "Biography of Yuan Yuan" in Huaijiu High School..., I gave such a question in the exam: "After reading..., briefly describe the situation of the Ming Dynasty and try to compare the similarities and differences with the current war of resistance in our country." Students who study books by rote can never do this question. My purpose is to make scholars read books in a lively way and pay close attention to reality at the same time.</p>
<p>(9) As for calligraphy, it is originally the responsibility of the national language teacher to guide. However, today, as long as the writing is clear, it is enough. If you really want to study the style of calligraphy, it has become an art. Most of the new national language teachers may not be familiar with various styles of calligraphy, especially may not be able to recognize the personality of the scholars through their handwriting, so as to guide them to copy a certain kind of stele. Therefore, I think that in the future, calligraphy should be hired by experts to be in charge of the guidance.</p>
<p>4. The tasks, training, and treatment of teachers (1) Because the national language subject has the most complex influence on scholars, and because the national language teacher has the deepest understanding of scholars, the national language teacher should, and also is most convenient to, take into account various aspects such as language skills and ideological knowledge, character, and behavior to train scholars. Therefore, the task is also the most important.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to studying language, literary history, literary and artistic thoughts, and writing skills, national language teachers should also be familiar with historical background and realistic situation. As for other common sense, they must also be broad. Therefore, they must read newspapers every day, read important literary and artistic journals and masterpieces, and should also choose and read general magazines and books. Their own character and behavior must be more carefully cultivated to become a model for scholars. At least one meeting of all national language teachers in the school should be held every month to exchange teaching experience and discuss improvement methods.</p>
<p>(3) The training and education influence of national language teachers is actually greater and deeper than that of the training and education director. Therefore, it should be clearly stipulated that they must also be class tutors. At the same time, national language teachers spend more preparation time and paper revision time than teachers of other subjects. Therefore, in addition to the regular salary, composition revision fees should be added to make them more willing to do their jobs. In recent years, prices have soared, and the treatment of teachers in general schools has decreased instead. In order to be forced to live, teachers will inevitably be distracted by other things. As a result, teaching efficiency is reduced, which must be corrected immediately. Teaching is originally a hard career, but it must also be taken into account that teachers' lives can be maintained. Especially national language teachers who cannot have too many part-time jobs (I think each national language teacher should teach two classes of national language to do their job well), the treatment should be increased.</p>
<p>Some people think that the scope of the national language subject is too narrow, and even the status of the national language subject is too low, so that the national language subject cannot achieve as many effects as it should on scholars. This is very regrettable. In the future, we should regard the national language subject as the most basic course for training scholars to become new Chinese citizens, and give it special attention and reform. (End)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Finance in the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Qian Zhiping</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>From the end of 1936 to the outbreak of the 'July 7th' Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), it can be said that China's economy was at its peak. Due to the implementation of the legal tender policy and the general prosperity of the domestic economy, the development of the financial industry during this period was unprecedented. New enterprises were established one after another, and both domestic and foreign bond markets rose to 80-90%. The artillery fire at Lugou Bridge (Marco Polo Bridge) erupted at this time. This war of resistance was unprecedented in nature. Shanghai, which has always held the financial hub of the country, has also been affected as never before. Strangely enough, China's financial institutions were not considered sound in the first place, but whenever an incident occurred, they were always able to cope with ease and turn danger into safety. As for what has happened in the past, such as the "September 18th Incident," the "January 28th Incident," the "Minbian Incident," and the "Silver Export Problem," of course, comparing this war of resistance with the past, the nature is unknown how many times more severe. The "July 7th" Incident occurred in North China, and it was not immediately felt to be very serious. The "August 13th" Incident (Battle of Shanghai) happened on a Friday, followed by two days of closure for Shanghai's banking and money industries. On August 16th, business resumed, and at the same time, the government promulgated regulations to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals to no more than 5%, on the one hand to prevent capital flight, and on the other hand to maintain the financial industry. In addition, the most important thing was the handling of rediscounting by the Shanghai Four Banks Rediscount Committee and the handling of interbank lending by the Bank Reserves Committee. The two are similar in nature; the difference is that the rediscount conditions are stricter, and the interbank lending conditions are looser. With rediscounting and interbank lending, legitimate industrial and commercial activities would not be stagnant due to lack of funds. These are the results of the government's painstaking efforts and the financial industry's meticulous planning. Of course, it is not to say that with the above coping methods, the financial industry can be completely free of panic and losses, but rather to reduce panic and losses to a level that does not cause any shakeup in the financial industry!</p>
<p>(II) Financial Panic and Losses in Shanghai during the War of Resistance</p>
<p>This can be discussed from three aspects. The financial industry controls the lifeline of all industries. When the war of resistance broke out, the general market was panicked, and the financial industry could not escape this scope. At the same time, there are two special things related to the financial industry:</p>
<p>A. Responding to Withdrawals　At the beginning of the war, based on psychological factors, general depositors withdrew funds one after another within the possible scope of the financial stabilization measures. Banks, of course, had to work hard to cope. In the six months before the war, it was the most prosperous period in China's economy, and the deposit amounts of various banks were estimated to have increased by 10% to 20% and even 30% compared to the end of 1936. After this widespread withdrawal, the numbers decreased significantly. If we compare the reported deposit amounts of various banks at the end of 1936 with those at the end of 1937, we can see the decrease in the deposit amounts of various banks at that time. According to the Shanghai Commercial Bank's business report, at the end of 1936, deposits were 15,379,000, and at the end of 1937, deposits decreased to 12,921,000. Another example is the business report of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, which showed that at the end of June 1937, deposits were 72,730,000, and at the end of December of the same year, they decreased to 56,350,000, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>B. Losses on Loans and Investments　Many banks invested in real estate, and the losses in the occupied areas are still impossible to estimate. In addition, all banks hold public bonds, and now the unofficial market price of public bonds has fallen below the statutory price, but this is illegal. Banks still calculate the statutory price when using public bonds as collateral to the Four Banks, so there is no loss to speak of. As for loans, there are credit loans and mortgage loans. Some credit loans cannot be recovered because debtors have moved or died. Mortgage loans suffer even greater losses due to the destruction of collateral in the occupied areas. Therefore, a peculiar psychology has emerged, believing that credit loans are more reliable than mortgage loans because as long as the debtor exists, recovery is possible. The safety of the collateral is instead not as good. In fact, even if the collateral has been destroyed, the debtor cannot be relieved of the responsibility of repayment, but this is a legal issue, which will not be discussed in depth here. We only look at the losses suffered by the loans and investments of various banks due to the war, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>(III) Shanghai's Financial Industry under Abnormal Development</p>
<p>The above is the situation at the end of 1937. By 1938, the situation had changed drastically; this change is undoubtedly more accurately based on political reasons. After the National Army withdrew to the west, Shanghai changed from the front line of the war of resistance to a relatively safe rear area. As Nanjing fell and the war moved west, the general wealthy class regarded Shanghai as a comfortable nest and came one after another. With them came a batch of mobile funds. At the beginning of the war of resistance, everyone was afraid that the legal tender would be unreliable and that the banks would be shaken, so they bought foreign exchange and hoarded cash; later, seeing that the legal tender had not changed or shaken much, and that the purchasing power of the legal tender both domestically and externally could be maintained, some of the escaped funds turned from foreign exchange to legal tender one after another: the cash hoarded in safe deposit boxes was also deposited into banks together. This major change caused the deposits of Shanghai's financial industry to change from decline to a sharp increase. Although the numbers are difficult to estimate, they are definitely not small.</p>
<p>Now everyone is clamoring "funds to the interior." If this batch of hot money in Shanghai flows to the interior, it can help develop the southwest and be of great benefit. Conversely, if it stagnates in Shanghai and is not used properly, it will directly and indirectly create opportunities for others, which is extremely harmful. Let's take a look at the harmful aspects.</p>
<p>(IV) Prosperity of Consumption Industries and the Rise of Speculation</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island and the population concentrated rapidly, the consumption industry has also prospered. Whether it is the upper, middle, or lower class of consumption industries, business is booming, making a fortune from the "national crisis." These many consumption industries can be divided into three categories: (1) those originally in the concession area, (2) those relocated from the war zone, and (3) those newly established. But they all have the same goal: to intensify the consumption of China's lifeblood of foreign exchange and maintain Shanghai's original position in the country's foreign trade. This phenomenon is really heartbreaking to speak of. Generally speaking, the prosperity of a place's industry and commerce is closely related to the place's capital utilization policy. Although the prosperity in the isolated island is caused by its special political status, the truth that the hot money filling Shanghai has not been put to proper use cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>What is even more unbearable is the use of hot money for various speculations, fueling many financial storms:</p>
<p>When the unofficial foreign exchange market first appeared in Shanghai, the forward rate was high, and the spot rate was low; therefore, a large portion of the funds was used for arbitrage transactions. Not long ago, two loans from the United Kingdom and the United States were established, and the foreign exchange market stabilized. Those engaged in arbitrage could not profit, so they turned to public bond speculation. The most concrete manifestation of the rise of speculation is the proliferation of small money shops and silver companies in Shanghai. The business of these small money shops and silver companies includes remittance, discounting, foreign currency trading, and bond trading. Recently, the remittance discount has been decreasing, which has dealt a blow to the activities of small money shops. As for them, they can be divided into two types. One type, with a smaller scope and limited capital, buys and sells on behalf of customers, which is actually equivalent to facilitating capital flight. The other type, with a larger scope, directly engages in speculation, requiring huge amounts of working capital. If people in the industry have considerable relationships with the financial industry, they may be able to obtain huge loans.</p>
<p>In addition, real estate investment has led to "large-scale construction" in the concession area. Some of the newly emerging small factories in the concession area after the war have problems with the source of their raw materials or the destination of their products. These investments are obviously unreasonable. In short, some of the hot money concentrated in Shanghai has already had a negative impact, which is a serious problem at present.</p>
<p>(V) Conclusion</p>
<p>"Those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." At this critical juncture of the nation's survival, every citizen should contribute his greatest strength to the country. The southwest is now standing on the front line of the war of resistance. The southwest has very abundant natural resources, and what it lacks most is development funds. But Shanghai's financial industry is allowing rampant hot money to have a negative impact? The current speculation will one day turn into a hurricane that destroys Shanghai's financial industry. If we do not quickly adjust the current method of using hot money, everyone will regret it too late in the future. I hope that the financial authorities will quickly unite and work together to find a solution.</p>

The Guangzhou Savings Main Yu Xiguan branch and the Zhongshan Savings branch were moved to Chater Road, Hong Kong.</p>
<p>4. Expansion of Banking Business during the War</p>
<p>Following the first year of the war of resistance, the dynamics of Chinese banking business have shown significant performance. Regarding the central and chartered banks, there are three articles of the Measures for Reviewing Foreign Exchange Applications promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on March 14, six articles of the Rules for Purchasing Foreign Exchange, and the control of export foreign exchange promulgated on April 4, with a total of seven types promulgated successively. At the same time, legal tender was promoted to the border provinces. For example, Yunnan Province used Yunnan banknotes, but in the past year, due to the government and chartered banks adding branches in Yunnan Province, the widespread circulation of legal tender was promoted.</p>
<p>The war business dynamics of provincial and municipal banks: (1) The foreign exchange of Yunnan Province is handled by Fumin New Bank, and its control methods are: (1) Export goods should settle and sell foreign exchange according to the buying price of Fumin Bank; (2) Export goods can be mortgaged and borrowed from Fumin Bank and handle follow-up mortgages or reserve funds; (3) For the necessary foreign goods in the province that are suitable for military and people's livelihood, after the application is approved by Fumin Bank, foreign exchange will be supplied according to the selling price. (2) The issuance of subsidiary currency: Due to the lack of subsidiary currency in Jiangxi Province, the Provincial Department of Finance, together with Jiangxi Yumin, Jiangxi Construction, and Nanchang City Bank, organized a five-cent subsidiary currency note issuance and custody committee to issue 800,000 five-cent subsidiary currency notes, valued at 4 million legal tender. The issuance method is quite cautious, that is, the copper yuan notes already issued by the three banks of Yumin Construction and Nanchang City are limited to be recovered and invalidated at 280 cash per string (the value of each string is approved by the Ministry of Finance), and to receive five-cent subsidiary currency notes, there must be reliable collateral, and it must first be approved by the provincial government, and the prescribed use is limited to recovering copper yuan notes, civilian pawnshops, civilian factories, wasteland reclamation, and agricultural products. The Hunan Provincial Bank also issued 5 million subsidiary currency. (3) The expansion of rural loans: The Fujian Provincial Bank cooperated with the governments of various counties, with each county receiving amounts ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Hunan Provincial Bank, the Guangdong Provincial Bank, etc. have all provided large amounts of loans. (See below)</p>
<p>As for the expansion of banking business, there have been a total of eight in the past year. Two of them increased capital, three added savings business, two expanded branch offices (one of which belongs to the increase in capital), and two expanded organizations. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sze Ming Bank: The Xiafei Road office in Shanghai was expanded into a branch office on January 1.</p>
<p>(2) Sichuan Provincial Bank: The Neijiang office under its jurisdiction was expanded into a branch office in March; the Huijiang, Taihezhen, Longchang, Santai, Fushun, and Wu exchange offices were expanded into offices from August 1. The bank also increased its capital to 10 million yuan on August 20.</p>
<p>(3) Guangxi Bank: A savings department was added from July 1, and in order to encourage savings by civilians and employees, a small savings account was specially established. The initial deposit is more than one yuan, and after that, no matter one corner or five points, it can be deposited at any time. The interest rate is 4% per annum, and there are additional interest methods.</p>
<p>(4) Guangdong Provincial Bank: In order to expand rural loans, a rural loan department was added in April.</p>
<p>(5) Shaanxi Provincial Bank: An additional 3 million yuan of official funds were allocated.</p>
<p>(6) Chongqing Bank: A women's savings department was added on May 18.</p>
<p>(7) China General Chamber of Commerce Bank: Its savings department added a savings plan, where an account can be opened with a deposit of one yuan or more in national currency. After that, deposits can be made whenever there are funds, and suspended when there are no funds, regardless of the amount and regardless of how many days apart. Interest is calculated every six months and added to the principal to generate interest. If the deposit is renewed upon maturity, even more preferential treatment can be enjoyed. If there is an urgent need in the middle, a cash loan can be obtained from the bank, with the interest rate increased by 1% on top of the deposit interest rate.</p>
<p>(8) Fujian Provincial Bank: An agricultural affairs section was added in August.</p>
<p>5. A Glimpse of Important Bank Loans</p>

<h3>The Raw Material Trade of the United States</h3>
<p>— Written by E. Janeway, Translated by Zhu Jijun</p>
<p>The economic power that has the deepest and most significant influence on the future internationally is the United States' monopoly on the supply of raw materials. The European crisis in September 1938 has prompted Asia to begin reducing its position as the world's main supplier of raw materials. Because the dire consequences of this crisis have amplified various forces that are forcing the world's raw material trade to transform its former face.</p>
<p>The main customers for the main raw materials of the Far East and Southeast Asia—silk, tungsten, antimony, rubber, tin, magnesium, manganese, etc.—are the United States, which needs more than half of the total exports. Therefore, Asia's future export trade to the world market will depend entirely on the support of the United States. The capacity of the sea lanes through which these raw materials must pass to the Western Hemisphere depends indirectly on the ability of all countries in the world to eliminate the scourge of war. For Asia's monopoly on raw material exports, war is a fatal blow.</p>
<p>The new crisis in the Mediterranean has made the customers of Asian raw materials deeply aware that this transportation route is no longer reliable.</p>
<p>Japan's seizure of Guangzhou aims to prevent China from obtaining supplies from Europe and the United States. This is a way for Japan to sanction China; it cut off Guangzhou's rear and overseas transportation. The second role of blockading Guangzhou is, of course, to blockade Hong Kong. At the same time, it makes it possible for Japan to cut off trade routes between Southeast Asia and the United States when the Mediterranean crisis intensifies and blocks another route. Once Japan controls Singapore and the passage for overseas trade, it will simply cut off the export of rubber from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The US authorities have long been aware of the importance of this situation for US industry, so they have prepared many steps in the hope of preventing this blockade. Various tin industries—steel, canning, automobile, and agricultural equipment industries—have prepared a plan to deal with emergencies. Because the tin trade is such that tin ore is not directly transported to the United States but passes through the Mediterranean in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. After it is smelted, it is transported to the United States. In this way, after paying a handling fee to the two countries that specialize in smelting ore, the tin shipped across the Atlantic to the United States is no longer tin ore but has become iron tin (like iron tin). This iron tin can be forged into tinplate.</p>
<p>But the US tin customers are also very worried about the precarious state of the Mediterranean (because broad tin must pass through the Mediterranean to reach European tin smelting plants), no less than the fear of the war severing Asian sources. So they raced to sign purchase contracts with tin-producing countries and agreed with the sellers to deliver as much as possible as soon as possible while peace could be maintained and the contracts were valid. What bothers them most is the fear that one day the suppliers will not be able to afford the huge orders or that production will be reduced to 20%.</p>
<p>Therefore, they are also planning another long-term policy to ensure peace. The first and most urgent plan is the establishment of a system to limit the export of tin scraps, which has been successful in greatly reducing the export of tin scraps this year.</p>
<p>The second plan is to build tin smelting plants (the United States did not have such plants in the past). They believe that the danger of relying on Asia is very great, which makes them have to eliminate another danger of relying on European tin smelting. What's more, they believe that the old-fashioned and unproductive European tin smelting plants must be replaced by modern tin smelting plants anyway.</p>
<p>The third plan is to add some new interests to the current US foreign policy. The United States must sign a trade agreement with Bolivia, stipulating that Bolivia can obtain the raw materials it needs from the United States in exchange for supplying the United States with tin ore as much as possible. Finally, let's mention the current situation of the US tin industry. They have achieved great success in their plan to replace tin with other metals in the automobile industry; each car now needs about two pounds of tin, while the amount required in the past was seven pounds. Automobile production, like the production of canning H industry, has always been a major problem in the United States. But since accumulating huge amounts of orders and making Bolivia its sole producer of tin, this problem caused by the new political and naval situation in Asia has been solved.</p>
<p>As for other raw materials, there is also a risk that the supply will be cut off. They can be divided into two categories. One category is manganese and antimony. These two raw materials do not yet have adequate substitutes and must be imported from Asia (only a small portion can be imported from Cuba and Brazil). Therefore, the US government is doing its best to build a "mineral stock" that can supply US H industry for two years without relying on foreign imports. The cost of this work is about 140 million US dollars.</p>
<p>The second category is various alternative raw materials. For example, barium can replace tungsten, and the United States has a lot of molybdenum raw materials. In addition, if the tariff or price of tungsten is raised, the United States can also use Chinese tungsten. As for silk, it is said that the sixth-sixth rayon newly released by Dupont is the most satisfactory substitute. Its texture is not only suitable for civilian use but also suitable for military use. The only condition necessary for manufacturing this rayon is proficiency in production technology. The situation is the same for rubber, and Mexico and Brazil are also rubber producers. In short, the method of solving the supply problem of these raw materials is to rely on huge amounts of storage on the one hand and to strive for comprehensive advances in production technology on the other.</p>

<h3>Finance London Gold Unchanged, Cash Trading Stagnant</h3>
<p>The cash market situation was dull, and due to the Sunday holiday, only a few members were present. It is said that some foreign exchange dealers still wanted to sell at the previous closing price of 2,190 yuan, but Northern banks were not very interested, so no transactions took place. It was also reported that the trading department of a certain foreign exchange dealer quoted a selling price of 2,190 yuan, but a buying price reduced by 10 yuan, due to extreme and sudden fluctuations since the previous day.</p>
<p>The price of gold for jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged as the market for immediate transactions was stagnant. The price at the main shops remained at 222 yuan per tael, new shops at 220 yuan per tael, and the buying price at 214 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 4th: The price of British pure gold per ounce remains unchanged at £7 8s 4d.</p>

<h3>Grain Rice Prices High, Market Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday's supply of domestic rice still came from the fourth district of the lower reaches of the river, with over 3,000 packages transported by carts. Due to sufficient supplies in the market in recent days, hoarders and local sales outlets became hesitant and adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a weak market. Most goods failed to trade, the market softened, and as a result, high-quality thick japonica rice remained steady, medium-grade rice decreased by 0.05 yuan, and thin indica rice was particularly sluggish, falling back by 0.1 yuan. Du sheep, pointed rice, and "bian yuan" rice also tended to remain flat as a result.</p>
<h3>Seafood Wenzhou Continues to Open</h3>
<p>Wenzhou dried shrimp is continuously supplied and sells actively. Yesterday, another 66 pieces were opened, with high-end at 70 yuan, and medium-grade at 65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Red Jade Ginseng Stockpile is Low</h3>
<p>The inventory of red jade ginseng is sparse, and the trend is stable. Small sizes are even more scarce, so the market price has risen by more than 10 yuan recently. For example, dragon tooth picked strips are 175 yuan to 170 yuan, number one is 152 yuan, large number two is 148 yuan, small number two is 139 yuan, number three is 131 yuan, number four is 122 yuan, small number four is 116 yuan, number five is 109 yuan, small jade is 97 yuan, frozen jade picked strips are 151.5 yuan, output is 116.6 yuan per 100 pieces, number one is 141 yuan, number two is 136 yuan, large number three is 128 yuan, small number three is 121 yuan, number four is 114 yuan, number five is 105 yuan, frozen red ginseng number one is 129 yuan, number two is 120 yuan, number three is 105 yuan, auspicious red ginseng number one is 119 yuan, number two is 107 yuan, number three is 94 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Refined Green Sugar Maintains Original Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. Transactions in the exchange were not numerous. Spot goods: Number 24 Dutch coarse white sugar was 24.4 yuan, no transactions were made. Goods in this shop were 24.6 yuan, some transactions were made. Re-export goods were quoted at 16.3 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B Mark goods from Western warehouses were 24.4 yuan, Dutch red sugar was 16.55 yuan, unchanged. Newly arrived domestic green sugar was mostly still at 14.5 to 14.6 yuan, then a certain shop forcefully raised it to 14.8 yuan, and sold in small quantities, totaling one hundred and several tens of bags. Random foreign sugar was over one hundred bags at 16.5 yuan. Chaozhou sugar was slightly replenished, and the price lacked upward or downward movement.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Sichuan Ginger Extremely High</h3>
<p>Sichuan ginger, due to difficulties in supply and extreme scarcity in the market, the market price has gradually increased. It was over 50 yuan last winter, and yesterday it was reported to have risen another 5 yuan, with transactions at 55 yuan, which is more than half the increase from the lower price at the beginning. Furthermore, Jian ginger has not been shipped for a long time, so it feels even tighter.</p>
<h3>Fuel Firewood Supply Scarce, Local Sales Active</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of firewood has reportedly been hindered by winds, and few sailing ships have arrived in port. Only seven ships arrived in the lower reaches of the river yesterday, so people are expecting higher prices, and the local market has also become more active. The prices are: large size firewood is 4.5 bundles per yuan, medium size is 13 bundles per yuan, small size is 16 bundles per yuan, Bazhou long firewood is 18 bundles per yuan, small size pine firewood is 20 bundles per yuan. Transferring through the Yangjingbang canal adds to the cartage fee. It is reported that the demand for starting fires in stoves has been very high recently, and a large number of transactions have taken place.</p>
<h3>Sexual Hygiene German Success in Treating Kidney Deficiency with Youth Gland Extracts</h3>
<p>Thanks to the diligent research of scientists and physiologists, it has become known that the youth gland, the most important gland in the human body, is essential for improving the human race and promoting health. If this youth gland becomes diseased, reproductive weakness occurs, leading to symptoms such as spermatorrhea and kidney deficiency. Subsequently, the reproductive system falls into a pathological state, and the health of the nation is greatly affected!</p>
<p>Therefore, I can confidently say that the authority of the youth gland not only dominates individual health but also affects the entire nation. The male youth gland, including the entire testicle, is an important organ for producing semen. Every male needs a special substance secreted from the testicles to flow to various parts of the body to promote physical and mental health and invigorate sexual function. The female youth gland is an important organ for ovulation. If it becomes unhealthy, it can lead to irregular menstruation, anemia, and infertility.</p>
<p>Regarding the tragic consequences of youth gland weakness, German medical doctor Dr. Ritzmann and renowned physiologist Mr. Hürb presented two cases of the shocking impact of youth gland dysfunction. Their records are as follows:</p>
<p>A 20-year-old youth, who had been masturbating since the age of 16, subsequently suffered from neurasthenia and had spermatorrhea and complete loss of sexual function. As a result, he repeatedly postponed his marriage. His entire body was completely like a child's, weighing only 88 pounds, and his brain was weak.</p>
<p>Another case was a 35-year-old Jew who suffered from kidney deficiency and impotence due to multiple wives, leading to a breakdown in the relationship between husband and wife. After a doctor's examination, it was confirmed that his youth gland, which was responsible for performing its function, had lost its function.</p>
<p>These two patients, after being treated by renowned German physician Dr. Orge Foleg M.D. with the German youth gland endocrine preparation for men, "Nutri-Com," for one week, showed amazing results. At this time, the patients immediately felt refreshed, and all symptoms of insomnia and forgetfulness completely disappeared. After taking it for seven weeks, they each gained four pounds, and their development gradually improved, completely different from before. Three months later, they both successively recovered their libido. One held his wedding as scheduled, and the other no longer had to worry about the loss of sexual power.</p>
<p>Therefore, the German "Nutri-Com" has been praised by scholars around the world. The female version has the effect of regulating menstruation, nourishing seeds, replenishing blood, and preserving beauty, making it a sacred medicine for gynecology.</p>
<h3>The Best Treatment for Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng, Medical Doctor of Germany</p>
<p>Young people living in cities are more open-minded than those in the countryside, and they tend to pursue extravagance in everything. There is everything to enjoy in terms of entertainment. Young people are easily seduced by evil environments, which can lead to loss of vitality, reduced willpower, and masturbation. Over time, the kidney area becomes deficient, and the essence gate is damaged, leading to spermatorrhea. Therefore, the reason why urban youth are prone to spermatorrhea lies in this.</p>
<p>The usual treatments for spermatorrhea focus on the mental aspects, which is to require patients to strictly observe hygiene, cultivate a pure mind and few desires, reduce erotic stimulation, be careful with their diet, and avoid overwork. However, while this is effective for physiological spermatorrhea, for spermatorrhea caused by masturbation, in addition to the above-mentioned hygienic methods, one should actively take the testicular essence preparation for men, "Nutri-Com," to cultivate sexual power. Furthermore, one should also take "Naires Spermatorrhea Pills," invented by venereal disease expert Dr. Naires, to stop spermatorrhea. Taking three pills before bedtime can prevent spermatorrhea that night. In my clinical experiments, it has repeatedly shown amazing results, making it the best treatment for all types of spermatorrhea. If the body is too deficient, taking both medications together will show even more amazing effects.</p>
<h3>Those Suffering from Leukorrhea Should Consider Post-Marital Happiness</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhong Chang, Medical Doctor of the United States</p>
<p>Anyone who has gonorrhea that has not been cured for a long time, if they are already married, should consider that this disease is extremely easy to transmit to their beloved wife, leading to discord between husband and wife. Therefore, those suffering from gonorrhea who are fortunate enough to be unmarried should cure it in time to avoid having their secret disease discovered by their partner on their wedding night. This would cause the budding roots of love to wither and die, causing a tragedy in life. Is this not because they did not take precautions? In addition, if the symptoms of gonorrhea persist after marriage, the body's resistance will weaken day by day, and gonococci will become rampant. Therefore, gonorrhea patients often experience a worsening of symptoms after marriage, which is due to this reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of future marital happiness, we must quickly and thoroughly cure this stubborn gonorrhea. However, when treating gonorrhea, do not be misled by the heavily advertised remedies in general. Only those oral medications for gonorrhea treatment that are truly effective should be chosen. If one is misled by these intentions and purposes, I fear that one will never encounter an oral medication that can cure the disease for life. Since returning to the country after studying medicine in the United States, I have focused on the treatment of gonorrhea. The "Klinon," invented by a German doctor of gonorrhea, has been proven to be tens of thousands of times more effective than general, poorly made remedies over the years. It has two special features: (1) After taking "Klinon," the cells in the body produce an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. This effect can annihilate gonococci hidden in deep parts of the body such as joints and blood. Therefore, all new and old leukorrhea in men and women can be cured. Because it has this effect, wherever gonococci are present, the bactericidal power of "Klinon" follows. This special effect is not available in general over-the-counter remedies on the market today. (2) "Klinon" is made entirely using scientific extraction methods, so there are no side effects. It is completely different from the general sandalwood oil and cubeb-based remedies on the market that harm the digestive power of the stomach and intestines and stimulate the kidneys. Therefore, those who suffer from gonorrhea and seek to maintain marital happiness can only do so by taking "Klinon."</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>Why Does Leukorrhea Persist?</h3>
<p>Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Lacking Independent Judgement Leads to Misguidance</p>
<p>Hiding one's illness and avoiding medical treatment is certainly the main reason why general patients lose treatment, but lacking independent judgment and not being able to determine what kind of treatment can benefit and not harm the disease, and rashly being tempted by generally exaggerated giant advertisements, not understanding the truth, privately purchasing and taking medications in the hope of success, often leads to the opposite result. Whether a treatment is effective depends on the symptoms of gonorrhea. Gonorrhea remedies and other treatments that do not address the symptoms often cause complications, and the internal attack of gonococcal toxins is even more terrifying. In fact, gonorrhea patients are not difficult to treat in the beginning. It is only because patients lack independent judgment and are misled by exaggerated advertising, recklessly taking over-the-counter remedies, that it becomes chronic, and as a result, their wives are also infected, causing leukorrhea to increase. Therefore, even if one side is treated, it soon recurs due to sexual contact, making it even more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Must Strictly Adhere to Complete Elimination of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>However, based on my many years of experience, with regard to married men, it is necessary to have both husband and wife treated at the same time in order to cure the disease, because this is not enough to completely eliminate gonorrhea. In terms of treatment methods, careful consideration should be given. For example, in terms of electrotherapy, the latest German invention of static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy has an unexpected effect on eliminating gonococci. If one also takes the gonorrhea-specific drug "Klinon" internally, it will exert a bactericidal power that is far-reaching and meticulous. Therefore, any difficult-to-cure gonorrhea can be successfully treated using these methods. As for women's gonococcal leukorrhea, one can also take "Klinon" internally and use "Car-Snow vaginal tablets" externally as a suppository to clear the gonococci in the vagina, and complete recovery will be achieved within days, permanently eliminating the recurrence.</p>
<p>Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 appointment tickets will be given out each day, with each ticket costing only 50 cents.</p>
<h3>Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Nine out of ten cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are caused by chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is when the trachea is stimulated by external factors (such as wind and cold), causing coughs and increased secretions in the trachea. If the cough persists and does not heal, it will inevitably lead to pain in the lungs. The lungs are originally an insensitive organ, so the pain is caused by prolonged coughing damaging the pleura, leading to inflammation and pain. This kind of pain is different from others. It is like a needle prick. It is sometimes present and sometimes absent, or painful or hidden, and is the first sign of lung disease. One should seek treatment quickly, otherwise one will develop fever and hemoptysis. The most effective treatment is to take the lung disease-specific drug "Pulmonal." This drug not only has the effect of preventing pulmonary tuberculosis but also has the great power to replenish cells throughout the body. In the early stages of coughing, taking it will have the effect of suppressing coughs, dissolving phlegm, and treating tuberculosis.</p>

<h3>Various Countries Buying Chinese Ships To Expand Navigation Rights, Japanese Businesses Attempting to Monopolize Chinese Shipping and Obstructing Ships From Third Countries</h3>
<p>Since Japanese warships blockaded our coast and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, state-owned and private-owned ships were forced to suspend navigation. Chinese ships were either sunk to serve as blockades, seized by the Japanese army, or destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The remaining ships were sold to foreign merchants. Countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, Portugal, Greece, and Norway took the opportunity to expand their shipping businesses in China and infringe upon our navigation rights. Japanese businesses also attempted to monopolize shipping. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Merchant Ships Suspend Navigation and are Sold</p>
<p>State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, except for the newly built Yuanheng Lizhen series, have been sold to Jardine Matheson. Haixiang and Hairui, as well as various Yangtze River ships, are all in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Xinming, Taishun, Xinjiangtian, Tonghua, and Xinfeng have all been sunk to serve as blockades. Private Sanbei ships have been sold to Italian Zhongyi Company. Dada and Datong ships are all docked in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Huxing, Zhoushan, Taizhou, and Pingan ships have been sold to Portuguese merchants. Hefeng and other ships have been sold to Greek merchants. Huashang and other ships have been sold to Brazilian merchants. Ningshao and other ships have been sold to German merchants. Those sunk for use as blockades include Huaping and Taiping.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Expand and Infringe Upon Chinese Navigation Rights</p>
<p>British, American, German, Portuguese, Greek, and Brazilian merchants, after buying Chinese merchant ships, are making every effort to expand our coastal and lower Yangtze River routes, taking the opportunity to seize our navigation rights. Newly organized foreign shipping companies after the war, such as Italian Zhongyi, American Weili Han and Huamei, Portuguese Zhengde and Meili, and German Far East, in addition to German Lihe and Lulin, and Norwegian Hualun, are all engaged in shipping. Today, the routes of Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and occasionally Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou in Zhejiang, as well as the Shanghai-Chongming-Haiqi, Shanghai-Tongyang, and North-South Ocean routes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, have all been operated by foreign shipping companies.</p>
<p>Japanese Businesses Attempt to Monopolize Shipping</p>
<p>After the war, the Japanese company Nissin Company, subsidized by the Japanese government, controlled small inland river ships in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, seizing Chinese merchants' ships Xinhongxing, Chongming, and Tianci, renaming them to dominate the Shanghai-Chongming and Shanghai-Tong routes, preventing the opening of the Yangtze River, and monopolizing shipping. After protests from various countries were ineffective, it is now attempting to monopolize our shipping. In addition to opening the new Shanghai-Xiamen route, it is also planning to open a Nanyang line, namely the Shanghai-Xiamen-Hong Kong route. Regarding the North Ocean route Shanghai-Qingdao-Lianyungang-Yantai-Tianjin line, it is exclusively operated by Dalian Kisen Kaisha and Nissin Company. It is creating various obstacles for ships from third countries, such as unreasonable detention and inspection, which are too numerous to mention. Despite repeated negotiations by the authorities of third countries, the Japanese side remains the same.</p>
<p>Detaining Foreign Ships Hinders Shipping</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese side is claiming to be investigating nationality and detaining ships from third countries. The ships involved include Greek Yasheng, Portuguese Wanli, Hungarian Aida, British Yongzhen, Brazilian Yongda, Portuguese Hafa, Portuguese Haida, and Greek Liwuduo. As of today, apart from Yongzhen, Yongda, Hafa, Haida, and Wanli, which have been released after protests from the consuls of various countries, Yasheng, Aida, and Liwuduo have not yet been released. In addition, the Japanese are also blocking the Jiaojiang River at Haimen in Zhejiang, not allowing foreign merchants to operate the Shanghai-Fuzhou route, repeatedly hindering the shipping industry of third countries in China.</p>
<h3>Again, Japanese Soldiers are Anti-War and World-Weary Three Japanese Soldiers in Xinlonghua Simultaneously Commit Suicide with Pistols</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 4th), three soldiers, Otani, Kikutada Saburo, and Furuta Seishiro, of the Ikeda Unit of the Japanese army in Xinlonghua in the Nanshi district, simultaneously committed suicide with pistols. The bodies have been transported to Hongkou for cremation, which is a clear indication of the strong anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Police Recruit Japanese Police Officers Quota is Thirty People</h3>
<p>The Dalu News reported yesterday (the 4th) that the Japanese police force of the Public Security Bureau will soon reach its full strength. The number of Japanese personnel in the Public Security Bureau is set at 296, and the current number of Japanese police officers is 267. It is claimed that a certain Japanese Assistant Commissioner of Police in the Public Security Bureau has been ordered to go to Japan soon to recruit 30 Japanese police officers. The Public Security Bureau and the Japanese authorities reached an agreement on the evening of Friday, resulting in this move. For some time, the strength of the Japanese police force has been lower than the assigned number due to the financial difficulties of the Public Security Bureau after the war, so the force has not yet reached its full strength.</p>
<h3>Central Government Assists the Relocation of Factories By the End of Last Year, 138 Factories Had Started Operations in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Other Provinces</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has sought to destroy the industrial foundation of our nation. In the areas they invaded, they tried their best to bomb them beforehand, and then wantonly seize them after they were occupied. Fortunately, our authorities planned in advance, and all those that could be relocated were relocated to safe areas as early as possible, and a Factory Relocation Management Committee was established to assist the factories in handling the relocation. By the end of 1938, the number of important industrial and mining factories and machinery that had been relocated is recorded as follows: Machinery and hardware: 64 factories, totaling 4,494.8 tons; Electrical appliances and materials: 18 factories, totaling 3,071.1 tons; Chemical industry: 22 factories, totaling 3,124.3 tons; Ceramics and glass: 5 factories, totaling 32.0 tons; Culture and printing: 12 factories, totaling 1,678.5 tons; Textile industry: 7 factories, totaling 7,788.8 tons; Shipbuilding industry: 4 factories, totaling 172.8 tons; Coal mining industry: 2 factories, totaling 3,600.0 tons; Other industries: 4 factories, totaling 357.4 tons. A total of 138 factories, 24,918.7 tons. Most of the above factories have been moved to the western parts of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan provinces.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Cotton Shipped to Shanghai Ministry of Finance Re-Prohibits Shipments with Existing Documents Still Allowed for Export</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, in order to prevent national products from aiding the enemy, had previously stipulated 54 types of local products to be prohibited from being transported to occupied areas, and Shanghai was also considered an area controlled by Japanese forces, so it was also banned. The Zhejiang Customs was ordered to comply. Subsequently, the chambers of commerce and various industries in Shanghai and Ningbo sent telegrams requesting approval, and the authorities approved cotton, paper, eggs, bamboo, wood, tea, and other six types to be allowed to be transported to Shanghai, provided that the relevant chambers of commerce and trade associations were responsible for providing proof before they could be released. After receiving this order, various industries prepared the necessary documents and transported cotton and other goods stored in Ningbo to Shanghai by ships such as Moufu, Deping, Tangsai, and Meida. According to news from Ningbo, the Ministry of Finance believes that cotton is a military raw material, and if there are no restrictions on exports, abuses are inevitable, so it has decided to re-prohibit it. Those who have prepared the necessary documents and have not yet shipped the goods are still allowed to ship them, but no further requests will be accepted, and the Zhejiang Customs has been ordered to comply.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Rice Prices Rise to the Limit Bean and Rice Industry to Convene Meeting Today to Discuss the Issue of Rice Price Control</h3>
<p>The supply of rice in Shanghai has been affected by the direct procurement by the Japanese puppet regime from the production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, resulting in a gradual depletion of stocks in the interior and rising prices. For example, the price of rice in Wuxi has risen to 12.6 yuan. If it is to be transported to Shanghai, a transportation fee of 1.5 yuan must be added, so the cost per picul has reached 14.1 yuan. As a result, the price of the number one rice in the soybean and rice market yesterday morning has risen to 14 yuan, and the black market price has exceeded the limit price. The Market Management Committee has made every effort to stabilize the market, but various vendors have been forced to stop selling due to the soaring prices in the production areas. The daily arrival of rice in Shanghai has been about 2,000 to 3,000 bags, while the daily requirement of the two concessions is at least 7,000 bags (about 9,000 piculs based on 1.25 dou per picul). Fortunately, the concessions have 650,000 bags of rice in stock, so there is no shortage panic in Shanghai for the time being, but stabilizing prices is not easy. Moreover, glutinous rice has risen to 17 yuan per picul, and the retail price of number one rice in various rice shops has exceeded 14 yuan. Therefore, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association will convene a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 3:00 PM today to discuss everything. It is rumored that at this meeting, some rice merchants will propose raising the limit price of 14 yuan, but this move concerns the food supply of the entire city, and the Soybean and Rice Industry, which is responsible for regulating the food supply, should handle it properly. At the same time, the Rice and Grain Joint Management Committee organized by the concession authorities will also be reluctant to allow the increase.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Taiwan Line to Resume Soon; Registration of the "Hana Hai Fu" Completed; Jiaojiang Estuary Still Blockaded and on Alert</h3>
<p>The port of Haimen, Zhejiang, has been blockaded since the bombardment by Japanese warships, causing the Shanghai-Taiwan shipping line to be suspended for half a month. The shipping industry association requested permission from the authorities to resume operations, which has been granted. Vessel registration has been implemented, and ships such as the "Hana Hai Fu," which originally sailed the Shanghai-Taiwan route, have complied with the registration procedures. Once approved by the authorities, the route can be resumed. Currently, Jiaojiang remains under blockade with strict security measures.</p>
<h3>Yuan Order Continues Ban on Export of Millet and Wheat; Orders Issued to Provincial Governments to Instruct Subordinates to Comply</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan, in order to continue the ban on wheat exports, has sent telegrams to various provincial governments, ordering them to instruct their subordinates to comply. According to a joint telegram from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the proposal to continue banning the export of wheat and wheat-containing millet has been approved and orders have been issued to comply.</p>
<h3>French Electric Company Increases Electricity Prices; Electricity Up 15%, Power Up 25%</h3>
<p>Following repeated price increases by the Shanghai Waterworks Company and the Shanghai Power Company in the Public Concession, the Shanghai French Electric Company, also due to exchange rate issues, has decided to raise prices starting today. The announcement is as follows: "Regarding the electricity price increase for the company's customers, the French Concession Municipal Council approved the price list at a meeting on February 28th. Effective March 6, 1939 (Western calendar), electricity prices for lighting users will temporarily increase by 15%, and prices for power and electric heating users will increase by 25%. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Municipal Council's Police Authority Remains Intact; Police Cooperate with Japanese Military Police; Large-Scale Searches Continue</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that, regarding the Japanese announcement on the recent talks between the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities, it should be clarified that the Council retains its full police powers. According to the Land Regulations, no party other than the Municipal Council's Police Department may conduct independent police actions within the Public Concession. Any cooperation must be approved and arranged by the Chief of Police.</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that as a result of the agreement reached between the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities two days ago, the Police Department retains its police power within the Public Concession. The Police Department yesterday (the 4th) discussed with personnel from the Japanese Military Police the standard methods for preventing terrorist incidents. Although no announcement was issued after the meeting, it is understood that the steps already taken to prevent terrorist incidents will not undergo major changes.</p>
<p>It is also heard that incidents involving the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities caused by terrorist activities are now mostly handled by non-diplomatic personnel. Now that the Council and the Japanese side have signed an agreement, diplomatic work has at least temporarily ceased. Everything is now handled by the Police Department and the Japanese Military Police. However, it is reported that all steps taken by the Council will be notified to the Consular Body at any time. Municipal Council administrative personnel, the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, and embassy personnel, as well as all the lane streets in the Public Concession,</p>
<p>The work of setting up barbed wire fences continued yesterday. This work has now reached the Western District. Some lane streets beside roads outside the boundary are currently being blockaded. Police patrols continue in all areas of the city. Search teams in the Central District, the Old Zha District, and the Western District will continue to conduct large-scale searches for some time. According to the Public Concession Police Authority, although no</p>
<p>Terrorist crimes have occurred in over a week, they have no intention of easing security. The British West Yorkshire Regiment continued to patrol Nanjing Road yesterday, and other British troops were seen patrolling in the Western District. The number of British patrols in the French-controlled town of Fahua, where armed bandits are hiding, has been increased.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to China, Lady Kerr, Goes to America; Expected to Return to Shanghai in Early Autumn</h3>
<p>Lady Kerr, wife of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has been in Shanghai for several months and is deeply concerned about refugee children. Last year, she helped raise funds for the "Orphan Hospital" at the Great Guangming Theater. Lady Kerr personally collected over 10,000 yuan. Her kindness is admirable. It is now known that Lady Kerr returned to her hometown of Los Angeles, USA, by ship at 4:00 PM on the 4th. After a short stay there, she will travel to Chile en route. Lady Kerr is expected to return to Shanghai this summer or early autumn.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Holds Shareholders' Meeting in America; Share Transfers Suspended from March 1st</h3>
<p>According to the French newspaper "Journal de Shanghai," the Shanghai Telephone Company will hold its annual shareholders' meeting at 3:00 PM on April 10, 1939, at its American headquarters, located at 67 Broad Street, Borough of Manhattan, New York. The company will suspend stock transfers from March 1st.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Trade Commission Stipulates Export Standards for Tea Chests</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Trade Commission, in order to regulate tea chests exported to Hong Kong, has stipulated four standards and issued a notice to the tea inspection offices in Ningbo and Wenzhou, instructing them to forward the information to all tea merchants for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) The four corners of the chest must be joined in a sawtooth pattern; (2) Twelve dried wooden strips should be nailed inside the chest. However, for maple boxes with a thickness of 0.3 inches (Chinese measurement) or more, or fir boxes with a thickness of 0.4 inches or more, two wooden strips each may be reduced from the top and bottom of the box; (3) The inner wall of lead-lined boxes should still be lined with strong, clean paper to completely isolate the tea from the lead; (4) The outside of the box should indicate the type of tea, trademark, number of pieces, gross weight, net weight (new standard), tea farm number and location, and harvest/production period.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Postal Workers Transferred Out; Post Office's Situation Increasingly Difficult; Oppression from a Certain Quarter Intensifies Daily</h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai Postal Administration, although Shanghai's postal administration still maintains its integrity, oppression from a certain quarter is intensifying daily. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, significant changes in the Post Office include the addition of a Japanese postal director assistant, the addition of a Japanese chief inspector, the implementation of mail inspection, the cessation of the sale of the National Government Ministry of Finance stamps, the restoration of the Beijing-Shanghai airmail service, and the collection of Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Beijing, Shanghai-Guangdong, and Shanghai-Hangzhou telegram fees, etc. Recently, due to the increasingly deteriorating environment, a large number of postal workers will be transferred out of Shanghai, and the future of the Shanghai Post Office is of particular concern.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Suddenly Invade Haiyan; Garrison Fights Bravely; Guerrilla Forces Have Reached the Outskirts of Jiaxing; Ding Xishan's Troops Defend Zhuangjiahang; Fierce Battle at Ye Xie; Zhang Yan Recovered</h3>
<p>Haiyan, Zhejiang Province, which was recovered by guerrilla forces, has been invaded by Japanese troops several times, all without success. On the 5th, they concentrated their forces from Jiaxing and other places and launched a surprise attack on Haiyan. The local garrison also fought bravely, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The situation there is still chaotic. Guerrilla forces in Jiashan, Jiaxing, and other places have also risen up in response, attacking the Japanese rear. The Japanese troops in Jiaxing and other places have been largely transferred away, leaving them weak, relying only on the city walls for defense. The guerrilla forces have reached the outskirts of the city, established strongholds, and are about to launch an attack.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Retreat from Ye Xie: According to people from Minhang, six warships of the Japanese navy from Minhang, carrying more than 500 soldiers, together with the Japanese troops from Mishi Ferry, sailed to Ye Xie to attack the guerrilla force led by Li Zhiming. A fierce battle broke out, lasting from morning to night. The Japanese suffered over a hundred casualties, and the remaining enemy retreated in panic. Over a hundred Japanese bodies were transported the next day to near Beiqiao in Shanghai County for cremation. Li's troops suffered some losses.</p>
<p>Intense Fighting at Nanqiao</p>
<p>Nanqiao, Fengxian County, has been occupied for half a month. Guerrilla forces under Ding Xishan and Li Zhiming have been reinforced and surrounded the area for days. On the night of the 3rd, another fierce battle occurred, with gunfire and artillery fire throughout the night. The Chinese army is currently employing a strategy of containment and attrition. When the mission is completed, they retreat at dawn. The Japanese troops use daylight to divide into teams and travel by motorboat in the Hengli Jing and Nanqiao Port rivers that run through the Pu River, rushing east and west, hoping to break through to the Japanese troops besieged in Tinglin via Zhuangjiahang Shengzimiao along Nanqiao Port. However, they were unable to pass through Zhuangjiahang, which was defended by Ding's troops.</p>
<p>Zhang Yan Rural Areas Affected by Disaster</p>
<p>According to people from Zhujing, Zhangyan Town on the Songjiang-Jinshan border was invaded on the 1st of this month by 150 Japanese troops, traveling by more than ten motorboats and carrying guns and artillery. They charged directly into Gaoni Jing Denmu from the waterways of Punan Ye Xie Tang and Zhangze Estuary, and attacked Zhang Town. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese, fearing their rear would be cut off, retreated to the Songyin area behind Houtang. Zhangyan Town has been recovered by Ding Xishan's troops. As the Japanese retreated, they burned down more than ten villages, leaving hundreds of farmers homeless.</p>
<h3>Commanders of Various Countries' Defense Forces Agree to Cooperate with the Japanese Side; Continue to Provide Assistance at the Request of the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities have recently reached an understanding to cooperate in curbing terrorist activities in the Public Concession and areas outside the boundary. Subsequently, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai also notified the Japanese authorities yesterday (the 4th) that they would continue to provide assistance. This information was revealed by the Japanese navy spokesman when the Japanese side received reporters yesterday, regarding the visit of Japanese military police officers to the military commanders of Britain, the United States, and Italy, and the authorities of the police department.</p>
<p>In the announcement, the spokesman claimed that when the Japanese officers visited the commanders, they informed them that the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council had reached an understanding, and stated the Japanese side's views on this matter, and requested the understanding and cooperation of the garrison forces in fighting the recent terrorist incidents. The commanders of the garrison forces then congratulated the Japanese officers on the successful conclusion of the recent negotiations, and said that they would fully cooperate to maintain peace and order in Shanghai. This expression of goodwill, in the form of a willingness to cooperate with the Japanese army and the Council, was deeply</p>
<p>Appreciated by the Japanese side. Under these circumstances, the Japanese authorities expect to effectively maintain peace and order in Shanghai, so that the situation in the city is clearer, and hope that this spirit of cooperation between the Japanese side and third countries will continue to expand and overcome other difficulties. This is the view of the Japanese army and navy. A reporter asked whether the Japanese authorities felt that the Council had not cooperated in the past. The spokesman replied that he had not said so, but that the cooperation of the transformed party should be expanded. All previous meetings were held with the utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>The spokesman replied that the cooperation between the two parties was extended only to the Public Concession, or also to the area outside the boundary controlled by the Japanese side. In the past, the Japanese army would conduct methods of maintaining peace in the boundary area outside the Public Concession. However, the issue of improving the control of shipping to and from the Huangpu River was also discussed. The spokesman claimed that the news in the local newspapers that the Public Concession police would be able to enter the Japanese-controlled area to arrest armed criminals was inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Residents of Huaiyin Begin to Evacuate; War in Northern Jiangsu Breaks Out; Six Japanese Planes Circle Over Funing; Japanese Warships Spy on Haimen, Fierce Fighting Occurs</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry in this city, fierce fighting is currently underway in northern Jiangsu. The Chinese army has sent large numbers of reinforcements and is actively launching a counterattack, making considerable progress. Han Deqin, acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, is leading his troops to resist efforts and is also launching mobile warfare to attack the Japanese rear. Residents of Huaiyin have begun to evacuate because fighting has occurred near the city. It is also reported that yesterday morning, two teams of Japanese planes, a total of six aircraft, circled over Funing and then flew towards Huaiyin. In addition, since Nantong Tianshenggang in northern Jiangsu was occupied by the Japanese, the northern Jiangsu region has used that location as a hub for passengers and goods. The Japanese have long coveted that area and have attacked it repeatedly, all without success. On the 3rd of this month, more than 100 Japanese troops were sent from Nantong to attack. Upon hearing the news, the guerrilla forces there sent troops to intercept them, and a fierce battle broke out. After the guerrilla forces resisted bravely, advancing wave upon wave, the Japanese made no progress. On the morning of the 4th, two Japanese warships sailed to the port of Haimen, and small motorboats patrolled and spied, seemingly with intentions. All ports have now stepped up their defenses, and shipping is still normal, but the inspection of passenger and goods traffic is quite strict.</p>
<h3>Sending Domestic and Foreign Parcels Must Follow Prescribed Procedures; Do Not Place Them Here and There at Random; To Avoid Disorder</h3>
<p>Due to traffic congestion in various places and inconvenience of transportation, small parcels to be sent to domestic and foreign locations are piled up like mountains. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the transportation of goods to other places, the Shanghai Post Office is still trying its best to find ways to transport them. However, because many senders are not familiar with the parcel sending procedures, they often place the parcels to be sent here and there, wandering around the post office without a clue. According to the person in charge of the bureau, in the future, all sectors of society must follow the procedures stipulated by the post office when sending domestic and foreign parcels, and must not place them here and there at random to avoid disorder. The foreign parcel sending procedures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Overseas: (1) Fill out the required forms; (2) Go to the Customs Inspection Office and hand the parcel to the customs officer for inspection; (3) Go to the Customs Declaration Registration Office to retrieve the forms; (4) Please refer to the attached diagram to identify which counter the parcel to be sent should be handed to, and then hand it to the weighing officer at that counter for weighing; (5) Go to the stamp window to purchase the required stamps and stick them firmly on the parcel package; (6) Hand the parcel together with the tax bill, etc., to the receiving officer at the original weighing place for sending; (7) If the parcel is subject to customs duties, you must first pay the tax at the customs duty payment office and obtain a tax payment receipt; (8) Go to the receipt collection office to collect the parcel receipt; (9) The sender must not leave the counter before paying the tax and obtaining the parcel receipt; (10) If there is anything else that is unclear, please inquire at the information desk.</p>

<h3>Prices in Japan Soar; Anti-War Sentiment Increases Daily; People's Resentment Reaches a Boiling Point; University Students Find It Difficult to Make Ends Meet</h3>
<p>Dissenting Elements Are Often Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "China Press" published a London dispatch from February, one section of which stated that, according to a Hong Kong reporter for the "Daily People's Voice," travelers arriving in Hong Kong from Japan are deeply moved by the increasing anti-war sentiment in Japan. They claim that in recent weeks, Japanese police stations have arrested a large number of people who have complained about the war due to war-weariness. These people complain about the heavy taxes and the exorbitant cost of living, but of course the newspapers do not carry a word about these situations. Regarding the failure of the Japanese authorities' movement to influence Wu Peifu (Wu's declaration is full of high-sounding rhetoric, which can be regarded as a current humorous talk), the reporters all said that the Japanese would not hesitate to pay any huge reward to any Chinese leader who could launch a mass movement to make Japan end the war as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Students Can't Maintain Their Lives</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" states that under the pressure of the current situation in Tokyo, all kinds of prices have soared, and students are affected by this, writing to their parents, all complaining bitterly and asking for more remittances. The average standard of living for students has increased by 20%. According to a 1934 survey, the average monthly expenses for 5,000 students at Tokyo Imperial University were 9.65 yen for rent, 16.57 yen for food, 8.92 yen for research expenses, 4.80 yen for entertainment expenses, and 8.67 yen for miscellaneous expenses. As a result of this war, taking the price of leather shoes as an example, it has almost doubled. A set of uniforms has risen from around 22 yen to 28 yen, and an overcoat has risen from 32 yen to 44 yen. The average monthly food expenses have increased by about 2.5 yen compared to before the war. Only rent is similar to the summer of 1923, but everyone believes that rent will inevitably rise sooner or later like other price increases. According to a survey conducted by Tokyo Imperial University last November, the monthly living expenses for its students are about 60 yen.</p>

<h3>Supporting National Products; Money Shops Provide Credit Loans; Market Resumes Afternoon Session Today; Exchange Extended to 4 PM</h3>
<p>After various money shops and currency exchange shops resumed trading after closing accounts, the Money Industry Association extended the time for negotiable instruments, resumed the afternoon market session, held an annual meeting on the 9th, publicly worshiped former directors, provided as much credit lending as possible, and supported the development of national products. The following is a record of public sentiment:</p>
<p>Money Market Resumes Afternoon Session</p>
<p>The money industry association's market originally had a morning session (9:00 AM) and an afternoon session (12:00 PM). After the war, due to a sharp decline in the clearance of negotiable instruments, the afternoon session was canceled, and there was only a morning session at 9:00 AM every day, announcing the daily discount rates. Now, because order in the concession has been restored and the clearance of negotiable instruments is gradually recovering, the Market Committee has decided to resume the afternoon session starting today. The following is a record of the market announcement: "The afternoon session will resume on March 6th."</p>
<p>Negotiable Instrument Exchange Ends at 4 PM</p>
<p>After the money industry established the negotiable instrument exchange, it handled the exchange of negotiable instruments between peers in the Ningbo Road market from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM every day. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The total amount of exchange has gradually increased, and the exchanged negotiable instruments are divided into remittances and clearings. Now, after a committee resolution, the negotiable instrument exchange between peers will be extended to 4:00 PM starting from March 1st. As for the bank negotiable instrument clearing house, it will continue to collect money industry negotiable instruments as usual.</p>
<p>Money Shops Provide Credit Loans</p>
<p>Various national products factories and businesses in the concession, in view of the tightening of credit loans by various banks after the war, which prevented the national products industry from developing as much as possible, have requested the money industry to restore credit loans and support the development of the national products industry. It is heard that the money industry has granted the request. After resuming trading, various banks will provide as much credit lending as possible. However, for the sake of caution, a collateral system will be adopted. Therefore, various banks will provide credit loans to national products industry factories</p>
<p>The Money Industry Holds a Meeting to Publicly Worship Former Directors</p>
<p>After closing accounts, a total of forty-one money shops (remittance banks) resumed trading. The newly opened money shop is Sen Tai Zhuang, with a capital of 12,000 yuan, joining as a Zhen-character-numbered shop. Also, Zhen-character-numbered shop Hong Kang Xing Ji Zhuang has been changed to a Heng-character-numbered shop after resuming trading. In addition, the Money Industry Association has scheduled the annual meeting of the Northern Shanghai Money Industry at 9:00 AM on March 9th at the Northern Shanghai Money Industry Association Hall, publicly worshiping former directors. Managers of various banks are required to attend.</p>
<p>Hongxiang Dunyu Completes Liquidation</p>
<p>The remittance banks that voluntarily closed down and completed liquidation are: (1) Dunyu Tai Ji; (2) Hongxiang Yu Ji. The managers of these two banks have respectively handled the liquidation. Depositors have been notified to go to collect their deposits within a limited time, with interest calculated up to February 18th, and paid in full in one lump sum. As for loans, personnel have been dispatched separately to collect them. All employees, except for a few who remain to handle the liquidation, have been given severance pay and dismissed.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Flights Resume; Conditions Along the Way Are Still Not Peaceful; Pinghu Flights Scheduled to Resume in June</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Huzhou inland river flights, which were suspended due to the chaotic situation there, have been suspended for more than a month. They resumed their first flight yesterday. However, the conditions along the way are still not peaceful, so only cargo is carried for the time being, and passengers are not yet being carried. Pinghu flights are also scheduled to resume on the 6th, stopping at Chuanlai Miao and Songjiang along the way.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Property Adjustment Office Reduced and Merged; Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office Established; Cooperation Work Team and Wholesale Department Established; Central and Local Cooperation in Business Operations</h3>
<p>In order to adjust the wartime property adjustment agencies in Zhejiang Province, simplify their system, concentrate their powers, and increase administrative efficiency, the Provincial Government specifically proposed and resolved at its 1048th meeting to abolish the Wartime Property Adjustment Committee and merge the Wartime Property Adjustment Office into the Construction Department. The functions and powers of the office are stipulated as the supervision and promotion of cooperation, the guidance and management of agricultural finance, and the adjustment of the production and sales of special products, etc. All district branches and county offices are abolished. All administrative matters are handled by the commissioner's offices of various districts and county governments. The import and export goods inspection office is directly under the Construction Department. The Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office is established to manage the purchase, transportation, sales, and processing of vegetable oil, tea, cotton, silk, and cocoons, etc., in order to promote exports. A wartime cooperation work team is established to universally develop the province's cooperative undertakings. A cooperative wholesale department is established to operate wholesale businesses for cooperative societies at all levels in order to promote the development of cooperative societies and mutual assistance. The expenses of the above-mentioned agencies will not exceed the budget approved by the Wartime Property Adjustment Office. The Adjustment Office is divided into three groups, and the Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office is divided into four departments: Tung Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk. The director of the Adjustment Office will also serve as the director of the Management Office. It is heard that the candidates have been internally determined and will be submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval and appointment. The various businesses under the jurisdiction of the Management Office are planned to be operated in cooperation with the central government. Administrative management, etc., will be under the province, while the central government will be responsible for allocating funds for expenses.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese War: Prospects for Far Eastern Finance (Part 2) - Speech by the Chairman of HSBC at the Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Shanghai Gradually Turns to Prosperity After the Calamity</p>
<p>Due to its circumstances, Shanghai cannot but yield somewhat to the new situation. However, from the surface, there is little change this year. Although the Yangtze River, its only lifeline, has been cut off, imports and exports have shown a marked turnaround in recent months compared to the first few months of 1938. The number of residents in the so-called safety zone in Shanghai, although perhaps not more than before, is certainly comparable to those residing in the public concessions, French concessions, and Chinese areas. Moreover, industry is booming in the Western District under the Shanghai Municipal Council, with spinning mills, silk weaving factories, and paper mills emerging one after another. This development has overwhelmed the Municipal Council and companies providing electricity and gas. As for the Japanese-controlled area north of the Suzhou Creek, there is little to report to you, gentlemen, except for a small number of factories. Only a few thousand Chinese have returned there. But on the whole, the situation in this area is no different from last year. There is still no sign of reconstruction in the burned and bombed war zones. Unfortunately, negotiations between the Shanghai Public Concession authorities and the Japanese Navy and Army authorities stationed in Shanghai have made no progress. I can only reiterate what the Chairman said last year: the powers should now assist the Municipal Council pending resolution of various issues.</p>
<p>China's Organizational Threads are Strong</p>
<p>Any tourist traveling from China to Japan will be surprised that Japan seems to be completely unaffected by the war. In fact, the country is increasingly affected by the war day by day. The value of the Japanese yen is sometimes slightly higher than the Chinese legal tender, and sometimes only the same as the Chinese legal tender. Japan is indeed a well-organized country, and its government structure is extremely sound. Given the country's current situation, it would be a mistake to think that its endurance is insufficient. Whether the country's environment will change in the future depends on the progress of its politics. China's disorganized structure is absolutely different from Japan's organized one. However, China's organizational threads are very strong. This advantage is truly unexpected. Chinese people have elastic qualities, so it is not easy to break them. In our observation of the economic situation of the two countries, we should not overemphasize this aspect. Under the current social conditions, even Europe has no right to question Asian problems, even though budget tables, national debt currency circulation, and reserve statistics show the opposite state. Even the most solemn authorities often misjudge these issues. The relationship between "Manchuria" and Japan is "closer year by year, so I do not want to say anything more about other issues, except to draw your attention to the trade agreement it has established with Germany. This trade agreement will inevitably seize the trade of other countries. However, what is most noteworthy is that the value of goods purchased from the United States is higher than before, as it is a large amount of raw materials for the military industry.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is Not Threatened by War</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a tax-free port, and many foreign goods are transshipped to mainland China via Hong Kong. This year is the same as in the past, and the trade situation is erratic. The fall of Guangzhou and the blockade of other ports in South China have certainly affected merchants, but not enough to threaten ordinary merchants. Let us wait and see how the changes will be this year. Fortunately, Hong Kong's currency and financial situation is still very stable, so we all have full confidence to deal with the future situation. As for the trade and financial situation in the Philippines, 1938 was slightly worse than before, but it is extremely optimistic for the coming year, as gold production and non-ferrous metal goods are showing signs of recovery. This is very beneficial to the island's economic outlook. Regarding the island's independence, those who advocated independence from the United States before 1946 have now changed their strategy due to the Sino-Japanese War. As for the Malay Archipelago, its situation has been bleak since September 1937. There was no progress in 1938. Trade figures have proven that the trade situation this year is not good, not that the liquidity of the banks is excessive. The prosperity of Malaya originally depended on rubber and tin. Since 1938, the output of these two items has declined, and their average value has also decreased. Stock prices have continued to fall. Its future destiny will be no different from the past, which depends on the demand in the United States.</p>
<p>The Prolonged War Concerns the World</p>
<p>If Indian commerce is in decline, then the export industry is even more tragic. In April of last year, the Reserve Bank of India lowered its purchase rate of foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market underwent a significant change. The impact of this weakened the foreign exchange market. Only after the Indian government issued a strong statement declaring the maintenance of the exchange value of the rupee (Indian currency) was it able to prevent speculators from attacking the market. Finally, I would like to make some further comments on the situation in the Far East. In recent years, the relationship between China and Japan has gone from rupture to war. Unfortunately, the war has not yet ended, and the situation is now turbulent and dangerous. Unless mediation is tried quickly, the rift will become irreparable. For merchants of all countries, they certainly hope that the war will end soon, but for the millions of people struggling with power, it is a matter of survival. At this moment, it is not appropriate to describe in detail the current situation of hundreds and thousands of square miles being ravaged, as well as the cruel situation suffered by the war-stricken people who are still suffering before the war stops. I only hope that the rulers of the two countries can keep this situation in mind and not lightly let go of any opportunity for mediation, not only to solve the general problem of the suffering people, but also to enable the commerce between China and Japan to return to natural expansion through peaceful means, which is beneficial to the whole world.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman Was Raped by Robbers on Her Way Home to Get Married - Her Wedding Ornaments Were Also Robbed - She Committed Suicide by Jumping into the River Out of Shame and Anger</h3>
<p>Dan Guiying, a woman from Taicang, is eighteen years old and has a beautiful appearance. She has already been betrothed to someone. She came to Shanghai to escape the war. She has been in close contact with her fiancé. Recently, after an agreement between the parents of both parties, she will return to her hometown this month to get married. A few days ago, Guiying purchased all the ornaments and clothes used in the wedding in Shanghai. She carried them herself and walked back to her hometown to prepare for the wedding. Unexpectedly, when she walked to a remote place at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions at the end of Dachun Road in western Shanghai, she suddenly encountered robbers.</p>
<p>They Robbed Her on the Road - All the money, clothes, ornaments, and packages she was carrying were robbed. After being robbed, Guiying did not delay because the wedding was approaching, so she still returned to her hometown alone. Unexpectedly, misfortune did not come singly. When she walked to a place about fifteen miles away from her home in the countryside, she encountered four or five foreigners who stopped her and forcibly took her to the fields.</p>
<p>They Gang-Raped Her - After the incident, the foreigners left. Dan Guiying suffered this great humiliation and had no face to go home, so she turned back to Shanghai. She planned to visit her fiancé on the upper floor of the Jiufeng Rice Store at 77 Baike Road to tell him about the humiliation she had suffered on the road and planned to postpone the wedding. However, her fiancé had already returned to his hometown to proceed with the wedding, so the two could not meet. Dan Guiying felt all kinds of stimuli and</p>
<p>Committed Suicide - At 0:30 pm yesterday, she went to the Bund outside the French Concession's 16th pier alone and committed suicide by jumping into the river to wash away her shame. Fortunately, she was spotted by a boatman who quickly rescued her and handed her over to a patrolling policeman who took her to the Xiaodongmen Police Station. After the police chief inquired about the situation, he sent her to the International First Reception Center on Masnan Road for temporary placement because she had no relatives in Shanghai, and waited for her family to come to Shanghai to take her back.</p>
<h3>Five Cases of Women Committing Suicide</h3>
<p>Gu Chen, a local woman, is 25 years old and lives at 49 Ruihua Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession. At about 10:00 am yesterday, she had a quarrel with her husband, Gu Jinquan, over trivial family matters. Afterwards, she secretly swallowed a large amount of opium smoke and committed suicide. She was discovered by her family and immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. She was deeply poisoned and her life was in danger.</p>
<p>Qin Wang, a local woman (23 years old), a guest at Room 23 of the Xinxinxiangji Hotel at 114 Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Street, suddenly secretly swallowed a three-dollar gold ring at about 8:00 am yesterday in an attempt to commit suicide. She was later discovered by a waiter who immediately reported it to the police station, and an ambulance was dispatched to take her to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the reason for the suicide was a quarrel between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaomei, a woman from Luodian, is 21 years old and has been working as a servant at Yu's residence at 194 Lane 5, Meibaige Road, Public Concession. The woman suddenly had thoughts of death for some reason at 8:00 am yesterday and secretly swallowed poisonous potion to commit suicide. After she was discovered, the police station was informed and an investigation was dispatched. The poisoner was taken to the hospital for treatment. Because she took too much poison, her life may be in danger.</p>
<p>Niu Hong, a woman living at 24 Yangzi Village, Yidingpan Road, had a quarrel with her family and secretly swallowed poisonous potion to commit suicide at about 1:30 pm yesterday. She was discovered by her family who quickly called an ambulance to take her to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>He Wang, a woman living upstairs at a certain number in Cian Lane, Ningbo Road, is 26 years old. Several years ago, she met a man named He who falsely claimed that he had not yet married, so she rented a house to live with him. The woman repeatedly urged He to hold a wedding ceremony, but he kept delaying it. Until recently, she learned that He was already married and had recently disappeared. He Wang had thoughts of ending her life due to her bad experience and difficult life. At 4:50 pm yesterday, she secretly swallowed raw opium smoke in an attempt to commit suicide. She was discovered by her neighbors who quickly called an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, she did not take it for long and her life was not in danger.</p>
<h3>A Drug Trafficking Organization Was Cracked Down on Maixi Ai Road</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department received a confidential report the day before yesterday that Koreans had set up an organization to sell drugs such as morphine and heroin at 4 Lane 271, Maixi Ai Road. They immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the address to search. They seized 232 grams of morphine and arrested the owner of the organization, a Korean, on the spot. After questioning and registering him, they sent the Korean and the drugs to the competent Japanese consulate for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Young Man Was Cut and Injured</h3>
<p>At 0:45 am yesterday, a man named Zhou Zhixin (living in Xiangfu Lane, Kader Road) was suddenly stabbed in the head and arms with a knife by his enemy Wang Qi at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession. He bled profusely and fainted on the ground. The murderer fled wildly. The patrolling police heard the alarm and rushed to the scene and quickly took the injured person to the hospital.

<h3>The Trial of the Case of Poisoning the Foster Mother to Death Has Concluded - The Chemical Analysis of the Medicine Jar and Autopsy Found No Evidence of Guilt - The Girl Yu Zhen Confessed the Process of Her Mother Administering the Medicine - The Zhuang Family Claimed to Be Falsely Accused and Will Be Sentenced on the 11th</h3>
<p>Zhuang, the wife of Qian Wenbiao, an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, was sued for secretly putting Athilin tablets into the medicine jar at 146 Dexing Lane, Peng Road, and poisoning her 60-year-old foster mother, Zhuang Xu. When the First Special District Court continued to open the court at the end of last month, Gu Cai, the aunt and daughter of the deceased who was listening in the court, suddenly became abnormal and spoke nonsense. At that time, some people even said that it was the soul of the wronged who was possessed and prayed to her to transfer to the defendant during the next hearing to show her divine power. However, the case was reopened by Judge Huang at the Criminal Court No. 3 the morning before yesterday.</p>
<p>A Trial Was Held - Gu Cai was also listening in the court and showed no signs of abnormality. When someone asked Gu Cai about the situation on that day, she could not answer. The result of the chemical analysis report from the lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Department and the doctor of the Chemical Testing Office of the Public Works Department stated that no residual poison was found in the medicine jar, and the forensic autopsy of the body also did not find any poisonous substances. It is a pity that the deceased</p>
<p>The Bladder Has Rotted - Otherwise, the examination could still be carried out, etc. In court, the defendant Qian Zhuang was questioned. According to her confession, the cough medicine her mother took was decocted by her. At that time, Yu Zhen was not by her side. She was actually framed by Gu Cai. When the coffin was being prepared at the Central Funeral Home, Gu Cai forced her to sign a statement stating that the 2,400 yuan left by the deceased and other properties were all taken care of by the Gu family. She was accused because she did not agree. As for her daughter Yu Zhen, she was also hated by her because she was usually very strict. She</p>
<p>Initially Admitted Out of Anger - that she secretly put medicine tablets, etc. When asked the woman's daughter Yu Zhen, she confessed that when her mother was decocting the medicine, she saw her take out something from her pocket and put it into the medicine jar. After her grandmother took it, she slept until midnight. I got up to urinate and saw that her face had changed. At that time, my mother urged me to sleep quickly and turned off the lights. I knew that my grandmother had died at about 4 o'clock, etc. Gu Cai, as a witness, filed a case to prove the defendant's usual romantic behavior and repeated private taking of the deceased's property. Regarding</p>
<p>The Point of Murder - The woman claimed that she was informed by the defendant's daughter Yu Zhen, and the defendant also admitted it at the funeral home and was willing to use all the 2,400 yuan of inheritance for funeral expenses, sign the document, and kneel to beg not to report it to the police station, etc. However, the defendant finally confessed that she was actually framed by Gu Cai and hired a lawyer to appear in court to debate with the lawyer of the police department. Judge Huang ordered the defendant to be returned to prison and scheduled to be sentenced on the morning of the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>56 Bales of Cotton Yarn in the Xinhua Warehouse - The Police Department Implemented the Seizure - The Cotton Yarn Was Stolen from the Guerrilla Area - One Person Involved Was Arrested and Sent to the Court for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Warehouse on Gansu Road on the north bank of Suzhou Creek has 56 bales of cotton yarn worth more than 10,000 yuan. The Chinese Deputy Detective Yao Yuanlong and Western Detective Tanler of the Huisi Police Department under its jurisdiction investigated and found that the cotton yarn was stolen from a certain yarn factory in the guerrilla area and recently transported to Shanghai. However, the person who received the stolen goods has disappeared. It is urgent to first put forward and preserve the stolen yarn to avoid accidents. Therefore, the situation was reported by the police chief, and the First Special District Court was asked to issue a warrant to allow the yarn to be removed from the Xinhua Warehouse and seized for future disposal. After review by the court, the request was approved and the seizure was implemented. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge then arrested the person involved, Zhang Zaixing. Yesterday, he was also sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Meng conducted an interrogation. According to the request of the police department lawyer Qian Xunjiu for an extension to facilitate the investigation, Zhang was ordered to be detained and the interrogation was rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fugen - Fighting for the Nations</h3>
<p>The guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai have been very active recently. Since Miao Sen was appointed as the direct captain of the action team in the western part of Shanghai, the guerrilla work has become even more intense. He has repeatedly annihilated the Japanese army and achieved remarkable results. It is reported that Captain Zhou Fugen, who was dispatched by Miao to patrol the Xinjing Yejiadun area in northwestern Shanghai, encountered more than 30 Japanese soldiers. He killed more than 10 Japanese soldiers on the spot. Zhou was also shot in the arm and suffered serious injuries. It is now reported that Zhou has died of his injuries. Director Miao of the branch team mourned Zhou's death in the line of duty. In addition to submitting a request to the superiors for preferential treatment, he also held a meeting to mourn. Zhou was 28 years old and a native of Jintan, Jiangsu. He served as a company commander in the 3rd Division of the Army. He bravely fought against the enemy in the "August 13th" battle and made great achievements.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was the Lantern Festival in the Lunar Calendar - Women in Skirts and Wooden Clogs Danced at the Rainbow Temple - It Was Impossible to Walk in the City God Temple in the South City</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Lantern Festival in the Lunar Calendar. Women in Shanghai all like to burn incense on this day. In previous years, the City God Temple in Nanshi and the Bao'an Situ Temple (i.e. the Rainbow Temple) on Nanjing Road were crowded with women burning incense. The scene of skirts and wooden clogs dancing and the fragrance of clothes and hairpins was extremely grand. The City God of the City God Temple would also patrol the streets on this day, with all kinds of performances, which was especially grand. However, since the start of the all-out war of resistance, the suburbs of Shanghai have been besieged on all sides, and the City God Temple has fallen into the guerrilla area. Therefore, the act of patrolling has become a thing of the past. However, the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road had more women burning incense this year than in previous years due to the dense population in the concession. From morning to night, the temple was overcrowded. Ren Changtai Candle Shop on the left of the temple was even more crowded. Therefore, the police specially dispatched many Chinese police officers to suppress the crowds outside the temple and outside the candle shop. This scene of smoke and jewels reflecting each other did not disappear until after 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Fu Xiao'an Instigated His Henchmen to Investigate "Terrorists"</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Pseudo "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiao'an, in view of the constant staging of recent assassination incidents, could not sleep peacefully. In addition to deciding to build 40 small fortresses around the pseudo-municipal government for defense, he secretly appointed Wang Yunkui (transliteration), a Tianjin native who survived an assassination attempt on Hed Road a month ago, as a special commissioner for the pseudo-municipal government to investigate "terrorists" in the British and French concessions. After Wang received the pseudo-order, he quickly formed three teams of twelve people each, and has now begun operations.</p>
<h3>A Hearse Overturned at the Intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin Road - Twelve Passengers Were Injured</h3>
<p>Fan, the boss of the Quanxingkang Hotel on Zhejiang Road, died of a stroke. Yesterday, his funeral was held at the Dahua Funeral Home at the intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin Road. At that time, a hearse hired from the Taiping Ban Chang Automobile Company also followed the procession. All 12 people were employees of the wine shop. Unexpectedly, the car overturned at Dunxin Road at about 11:00 am, not far from its destination. All the passengers were slightly or seriously injured and were taken to Baolong Hospital by another car. 11 people were bandaged and discharged from the hospital because their injuries were not serious. Only Zheng Heqing, a native of Shaoxing, 36 years old, had a broken right arm and shoulder bone, with internal injuries. He needed an X-ray examination, so he was still in the hospital for treatment. The other 11 people with minor injuries included Lu Ashou, a native of Shaoxing, 33 years old, with injuries to both hands, Ruan Fude, a native of Ningbo, 14 years old, with a head injury, Wan Shengrong, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, with a hand injury, Zhu Akang, a native of Ningbo, 65 years old, with a head injury, Zhu Fashun, a native of Hangzhou, 41 years old, with a hand injury, Tong Xiangsheng, a native of Ningbo, 22 years old, with a hand injury, Xu Wenwei, a native of Shaoxing, 34 years old, with a head injury, Zhang Dengqing, a native of Shaoxing, 32 years old, with a head injury, Shen Jinsheng, a local, 45 years old, with a face injury, Ruan Xingyuan, a native of Ningbo, 58 years old, with an ear injury, and Huang Kunfu, a native of Ningbo, 37 years old, with a chest injury.</p>
<h3>A Fire Broke Out in the Ewo Packing Factory - More Than a Dozen Bales of Cotton Yarn Were Destroyed</h3>
<p>At around 2:30 pm yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the Ewo Packing Factory at 912 North Suzhou Road. The Central Fire Brigade received the report and immediately drove to put out the fire. It was immediately extinguished. It is estimated that more than a dozen pieces of cotton yarn were destroyed by fire, but a lot of cotton yarn was soaked in water, resulting in huge losses. The cause of the fire is unknown.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Public Celebration for Wen Lanting's Birthday, With Over a Thousand Well-wishers; Du Yuesheng and Others Sent Telegrams Offering Remote Congratulations</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 70th birthday of Mr. Wen Lanting, a leader in the yarn industry and philanthropic circles. Coinciding with the Lantern Festival according to the abolished lunar calendar, a public celebration was held by various sectors at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. The previous evening, Mr. Wen's disciples and others hosted a banquet to offer advance congratulations. Starting from 8:00 AM yesterday, friends from all walks of life continuously arrived at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association to offer their congratulations. Over a thousand people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiying, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Yan Junren, and Tang Zhiliang. Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Mao Heyuan, and others also sent telegrams from Hong Kong, remotely wishing Mr. Wen longevity and a prosperous life. The Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association's conference hall was set up as a ceremonial hall. As it was the Lantern Festival, the Shanghai Hongshou Calligraphy and Painting Association designed and hung up a "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" lantern display, illuminated by electric lights, which was extremely unique. In addition, there were numerous congratulatory couplets and poems presented by various sectors, a dazzling array. Guests were presented with Mr. Wen's photograph and a commemorative album. The Shanghai Yarn Exchange's national music ensemble performed on-site, and the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts and Music sang congratulatory birthday songs. The ceremony was simple yet solemn. The organizing committee, following Mr. Wen's instructions, kept everything frugal. Guests' birthday gifts were divided into three types: one, two, and three yuan. The banquet was purely vegetarian, and smoking, drinking, and theatrical performances were eliminated, aligning with the principle of thrift.</p>
<h3>Public Slaughterhouse in the French Concession Confiscates Pork, Valuing It at Six Cents Per Pound; Slaughtering Businesses Hold a Meeting and Disclaim Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession's slaughterhouse for paddy-fed livestock has a long-standing practice that after live pigs are slaughtered, they must be inspected by a doctor and stamped before they can be sold on the market. If the inspection fails, the pigs are not stamped and are returned to the owner for rendering into oil, the proceeds of which are still worth fifty to sixty percent. Last month, the French Concession slaughterhouse suddenly revised its regulations, stipulating that unstamped pigs would all be sent to the Public Concession's oil rendering factory for rendering, valued at six cents per pound. This differs greatly from the proceeds of rendering the oil themselves. Because the owners are in the meat industry, and the slaughtering businesses are only responsible for slaughtering on their behalf, charging a few jiao per head, the Fresh Pork Slaughtering Business Association, in order to avoid liability, convened a discussion meeting for members of the Second Special District at No. 12 Yu Qiaqing Road yesterday afternoon. Over forty people attended, including Sun Hanming, Liu Jinpei, Jin Cailang, Zhang Guorong, and Pang Minggen. Cao Wenquan was delegated to attend on behalf of the meat industry. The following resolutions were passed: 1. This association slaughters pigs on behalf of the meat industry and assumes no responsibility for any confiscations after slaughter. 2. The slaughterhouse's confiscation receipts will be returned to the meat shops. 3. In addition to having already sent a letter to the Meat Industry Association's Second Special District office, this association is willing to follow and assist to the best of its ability if that association initiates negotiations with the French authorities. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Husband Lures Wife Out, Then Savagely Chops Her With a Hatchet; Husband Claims His Wife Lied; Court Orders Postponement for Further Examination of Witnesses</h3>
<p>Xu Zhao, a woman from Pudong, is 27 years old and currently resides at No. 152 Caishi Street. Over half a year ago, she married Xu Azhong (33 years old this year), a fellow villager, through a failed matchmaker. Xu works as a carpenter. Since their marriage, they have had two children. However, on December 17th of the previous year, at around 7:00 PM, Xu tricked his wife Zhao into going out together, claiming they were looking for a house. When they reached Ping'anfang in Jiaxiyi Road, near Dapu Bridge, Xu suddenly produced a sharp hatchet and savagely chopped at Zhao. Fortunately, she quickly dodged, and only her clothes were slightly damaged. But Xu's malice was not yet satisfied, and he tried to gouge out her left eyeball but failed, causing her face to be covered in blood. After she cried out for help, Xu finally fled the scene. She then reported to the French police, and detectives arrested Xu. He was transferred to the Criminal Eighth Court of the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday. The French Concession's administrative authorities initiated a public prosecution for the crime of harming a spouse. The plaintiff stated the details of the attack. Xu Azhong testified that his wife Zhao had fled to her sister's house last year and had used up all of the savings of the household. That day, his wife forcibly snatched the hatchet from his hand on the road, and the injury to her face was caused by the struggle. He claimed that she lied to the police about him committing the violence and requested an investigation. Judge Qiu reviewed the testimony and ordered a postponement for further examination of witnesses. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Academic Circles Rise to Support the Cloth Clothing Movement; Girls' School Swears to Join; All Sectors Unanimously Support</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Cloth Clothing Association initiated and advocated the wearing of cloth clothing to promote the cloth clothing movement, and designated this year as the Cloth Clothing Year, all sectors of the city have unanimously supported it. They all believe that this movement not only conforms to the principle of thrift but also benefits the national economy and people's livelihood. Under the current circumstances, it should be vigorously promoted. The establishment of the association is indeed timely and appropriate. Encouraged by this, the association's work has become even more intense in recent days. It is also learned that the association received a letter from a well-known girls' school in western Shanghai, stating that all 1,214 teachers and students of the school, in agreement with the association's proposal, have sworn to wear cloth clothing and are willing to join as members. The association immediately sent a reply welcoming them. It is reported that the number of middle school teachers and students in the city who have joined the association has reached as many as five schools, but the girls' school is undoubtedly the most enthusiastic this time.</p>

<h3>The Lower Reaches of the Huangpu River Suddenly Became Tense Yesterday; Many Rumors in Hongkou, the Area is Unstable; All Ships, Large and Small, on the Huangpu River Were Thoroughly Searched</h3>
<p>The Hongkou area has been rife with rumors in recent days, and the Japanese are on high alert. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the situation suddenly became tense in the Huangpu River, from the Japanese Consulate in the Suzhou Creek eastward to the Songkou area for a distance of thirty to forty li. Several Japanese naval infantrymen, traveling by motorboats or small steamers, searched ships up and down the river. Except for large vessels, all small steamers, barges, wharf boats, sampans, and other civilian vessels operating on that section of the Huangpu River were ordered to stop at any time, and armed searches were conducted. Special attention was paid to hidden compartments. It is reported that this measure by the Japanese side is to prevent weapons from being smuggled into the Hongkou area by waterway, so as to prevent the area that the Japanese consider safe from being threatened. However, after being busy all day, they apparently did not find any weapons or dangerous goods. It is also learned that the three ferry crossings of Pudong Gaoqiao, Donggou, and Gaomiao along the north Huangpu River are defended by the Japanese army. Recently, it has been reported that the guerrillas on the Chuansha border have repeatedly used these three places to send brave team members, carrying weapons, to find small boats to cross to the Jiangwan Wusong area to engage in dangerous work. The Japanese have therefore paid close attention and must strictly search all those entering and leaving the ferry crossings. In addition, disguised as hawkers in plain clothes, they sent "troops" to secretly scout the whereabouts of the guerrillas. It is heard that the Japanese Army and Navy Special Service Department has jointly organized a wharf reconnaissance team to cut off the transportation of Chinese activists and guerrillas.</p>

<h3>Talking About Refugee Production Education</h3>
<p>— Zero</p>
<p>Some people say: "The refugees in Shanghai are really enjoying themselves, eating their fill all day and doing nothing!"</p>
<p>This is a "specious" statement. Some of the refugees in Shanghai have already participated in productive work. According to recent statistics, there are sixty-one types of small craft work that refugees in Shanghai are involved in, totaling more than 13,700 people. It can be seen that the refugees in Shanghai are not just sitting around and not working. Even for those who have no work to do, look, they are cramped in the reception centers all day long; they only eat enough to survive, and it is impossible to talk about "enjoying themselves"!</p>
<p>However, there are indeed two points that need to be discussed about the current refugee production work:</p>
<p>1. Lack of Opportunity: Some people lack the skills for the work, so only more than 10,000 out of the 100,000 refugees in the city can produce and live. This is not universal enough.</p>
<p>2. Lack of Systematic and Precise Planning: According to recent statistics, there are sixty-one types of small crafts. The work locations are either outside or inside the centers; the wages are either one yuan per day or only three cents per day. In terms of living management and training, there is a lack of systematic and precise planning.</p>
<p>Those of us who work in relief organizations have long had the above feelings and want to open refugee work training classes in the near future to promote refugee production education in a planned way. The types of training classes are as follows:</p>
<p>Soap Industry Training Class</p>
<p>Chemical Industry Training Class</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Transceiver Training Class</p>
<p>Sock Knitting Training Class</p>
<p>Rattan Weaving Training Class</p>
<p>Carpentry Training Class</p>
<p>Foreign Embroidery Training Class</p>
<p>Printing Training Class</p>
<p>Car Driving and Repairing Class</p>
<p>Barber Training Class</p>
<p>Shoemaker Repairing Training Class</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Installation and Repairing Training Class</p>
<p>Weaving Craft Training Class</p>
<p>Cement Worker Training Class</p>
<p>Waiter Training Class</p>
<p>Maid Training Class</p>
<p>The above are a total of sixteen types, and the required expenses are estimated to be no more than 4,000 yuan. We have 100,000 yuan in funding, and other kinds of work can be gradually planned and implemented so that all refugees have the opportunity to acquire work skills. We hope that people from all walks of life will do their best to help the relief organizations so that the production education plan can be fully realized. In this way, the problem of refugee production education can be solved, and social welfare can be improved.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of the Shanghai Education Community for Refugees</h3>
<p>— Sun Xiaolou</p>
<p>The traditional thinking of our country's scholars is that the only duty is to study behind closed doors, cultivate the mind, and pursue learning. Therefore, those who run education are most afraid of meddling in other people's affairs, burying themselves with students in their desks all day long, reading dead books, and reading books to death. It is as if there is no education outside of books, and no education outside of schools, resulting in the cultivation of many consumers who do not work with their limbs, do not know the five grains, and only have themselves and no society.</p>
<p>Although there have been more than 70 years of history since the reform of education, this kind of morbidity has still not been completely eliminated. Although the calls for popular education and mass education are very loud, 80% of the illiterate still occupy the first place among the countries in the world. This is whose responsibility, this is the responsibility of all of us who run education.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 100,000 refugees in Shanghai. It can be said that 90% of these more than 100,000 refugees have no productive skills, and 70% have not received education. Their family property has been destroyed, their flesh and blood have been scattered, they do not have enough clothes to keep warm, they do not have enough food to fill their stomachs, they do not know a word, and they do not have any skills. They can be said to be the most pitiful group of people in Shanghai society. How can those of us who run education still "teach behind closed doors" as before, leading a leisurely and carefree life, and ignoring these suffering and ignorant refugees?</p>
<p>Some people may say: In the past, I have already fulfilled a considerable responsibility at the request of a certain charitable organization in providing food and clothing for the refugees. Very good, donating money to provide for the refugees cannot be said to be unimportant, but passive support is not as good as active education. Recently, the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association launched a fundraising campaign for refugee production education, planning to raise 100,000 yuan in funding to educate more than 100,000 refugees, so that they can become literate and learn skills, giving the refugees the opportunity to be educated, and teaching the refugees to have productive skills. In this way, the goal of refugees being able to support themselves can be achieved in three or four months, in order to reduce the burden on society and increase the country's production. This is really a very meaningful thing. Standing in the position of the education community, we should actively promote and work hard to advance this plan, so that the goal of 100,000 yuan in funding can be achieved as soon as possible in order to complete the major plan of refugee production education. If you are parents, you can encourage your children; if you are teachers, you can encourage your students; at the same time, all sectors should publicize and encourage each other, then I think that the achievement of the goal of 200,000 yuan will definitely not be difficult. The author hereby petitions on behalf of more than 100,000 refugees before all sectors.</p>
<h3>An Announcement to All Sectors for Raising Funds for Refugee Production Education</h3>
<p>— Du Zuozhou</p>
<p>Since the "August 13th" Incident kicked off the war, refugees from all over the country have gathered in Shanghai, numbering nearly one million in total. Thanks to the enthusiastic relief efforts and generous donations from all sectors of Shanghai, refugee reception centers have been organized to accommodate and settle these millions of refugees as much as possible, so that they can solve the problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and not be displaced. It has been nine months since then. Although most of the refugees have been scattered, returning to their hometowns or finding employment, there are still more than 100,000 people left. These more than 100,000 people, on the one hand, rely on the continued generous donations from all sectors, and on the other hand, they rely on the enthusiastic work of the gentlemen who are in charge of relief work to ensure that the entire supply is not a problem. However, this can only be said to be a palliative measure. In the long run, it will not only be difficult to sustain, but it is also not a fundamental solution to the refugee problem.</p>
<p>Currently, the refugees in various reception centers are full and warm all day long and have nothing to do. If we do not think of other active ways to enable them to receive an education and cultivate a skill during this period of being rescued so that they can seek their own independent production, then they will inevitably become idle people in the future. If so, loving them is enough to harm them. Not only will they themselves be harmed for life, but the country and society will also suffer from their disadvantages. No one knows when the war will end. We only know relief, but we do not hurry to make them independent, then this kind of relief work will never end. Therefore, for the sake of the refugees, for the sake of society and the country, and for the responsibility of all sectors, generously donating funds to implement refugee production education is currently the most urgent work.</p>
<p>For this reason, comrades in the Shanghai education and cultural circles have recently launched a fundraising campaign for refugee production education under the organization of the Education Group Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association. Now, almost all of the teachers and students of large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai have been mobilized. Only five days have passed, and more than 100,000 yuan has been raised. This achievement is very optimistic. From this fundraising campaign, we can see that the people of our country can understand their responsibilities and obligations, and they all have the spirit to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations. With this spirit, we can predict that our work of saving the country and building the country will be completed as scheduled. However, the original target of this fundraising campaign was 200,000 yuan; now it is still far from the target, and we still hope that comrades in the education and cultural circles will continue to work hard, and people from all sectors will continue to generously donate, so that this fundraising campaign with great significance can be completed in the near fundraising period. If you are parents, you can encourage your children; if you are teachers, you can encourage your students; at the same time, all sectors should promote and encourage each other, then I think that the achievement of the goal of 200,000 yuan must not be difficult. The author hereby petitions on behalf of more than 100,000 refugees before all sectors.</p>
<p>In short, refugees are also a part of the Chinese nation. Their lives, like those of our compatriots who have not suffered, can be extended, and their thoughts and skills can be improved. This means that the revitalization of our nation is more assured, and the goal of national revitalization can be achieved. Every descendant of the Yellow Emperor can have the hope of obtaining a happy life. Therefore, it can be said that helping refugees is also helping ourselves.</p>
<p>Under this understanding that helping refugees is helping ourselves, we, the compatriots of Shanghai, who are known as the richest in the country, should first follow the principle of contributing money if we have money, and generously donate to help the more than 100,000 refugees in this city, so that they can receive education and learn productive skills in addition to getting food and clothing.</p>
<h3>"No Home, No Dad."</h3>
<p>— Huang Dingzuo</p>
<h3>Helping Refugees Is Helping Ourselves</h3>
<p>— Yiming</p>
<p>The more than 100,000 refugees currently in Shanghai, and the millions of refugees throughout the country, like the Chinese people who are not refugees, are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. In other words, today's refugees are still compatriots of the Chinese nation. Shouldn't we be happy and shouldn't we help our compatriots in difficult situations?</p>
<p>Of course, many compatriots are always concerned about the refugees and are doing their best to help the refugees. However, some compatriots neither care nor provide assistance. Why is this so? Because some compatriots do not fully understand the close relationship between refugees and themselves. Therefore, reflected in their actions, they are not concerned about the work of helping refugees.</p>
<p>First of all, we should understand that our country is currently at the most dangerous juncture. Only if the 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor, regardless of men, women, old, young, rich, or poor, can unite as one and help each other can we overcome this great crisis. Based on this premise, we help the refugees so that they can have food and clothing and have the opportunity to receive education and learn skills, which is to increase the strength of our entire nation. Conversely, many refugees die or become degenerate due to lack of assistance, or they remain ignorant and do not engage in production, which is to weaken the nation's vitality and reduce the number of helpers we have when dealing with national crises.</p>
<p>Secondly, considering the private interests of those compatriots who have not become refugees, there is also a close relationship with the refugees.</p>
<p>Because the prosperity of a country's people must rely on the development of the entire national economy, and the development of the national economy mainly depends on the prosperity of productivity and the large number of consumers. Now, the number of refugees in the country reaches tens of millions. If such a large number of refugees die or become depraved due to lack of assistance, then the nation's productivity will inevitably be weakened, and the amount of consumption will inevitably be reduced. Under this state of economic depression, all production sectors and business organizations will only tend to decline. Therefore, for the sake of the increasingly prosperous and comfortable economic lives of those compatriots who have not become refugees, it is also necessary to provide the necessary assistance to their own refugees.</p>

<h3>Save the Refugees</h3>
<p>— Feng Yixian</p>
<p>It has been many years since the work of saving refugees has been carried out on the isolated island. Even today, our urgent task is still inseparable from the previous task!</p>
<p>The safety of a social collective is based on the stability of the lives of its members. If the people have a livelihood, it can directly reduce criminal behavior and indirectly lay the foundation for social tranquility. There are many refugees on the isolated island now. If there is no overall rescue plan, can the social order be safe, and can we live in peace?</p>
<p>"At the beginning of humanity, people are inherently good." Therefore, all human beings must have great compassion. When we see the displaced refugees, without clothes and food, suffering, can we still bear to stand by and do nothing, and not exert the innate ability of kindness?</p>
<p>Those who are enthusiastic about saving the country are also enthusiastic about saving refugees. Those who are engaged in saving refugees are indirectly equal to engaging in the work of saving the country. Therefore, those who cannot save refugees are not worthy of talking about saving the country. If the national affairs are like this, we should sharpen our swords and prepare. If the environment is like this, we should save the refugees to do the work of saving the country.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the people on the isolated island are at least much better than the homeless refugees. In a moment of thought, with a hand's move, the refugees can be saved. Saving refugees is like saving a fire. Hurry up and save the refugees!</p>
<h3>Establishing a Permanent Foundation for Refugees</h3>
<p>— Sun Yucai</p>
<p>There are nearly one hundred thousand refugees in Shanghai right now. The sustenance and livelihood of these one hundred thousand refugees are entirely provided and maintained by the Refugee Relief Association. This association was initiated and organized by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in Shanghai's business community, who currently serves as its chairman. Mr. Yu is known for his enthusiasm for charity and is widely respected by the nation. Therefore, since its establishment, the association has achieved remarkable results and benefited the refugees immensely, a contribution of no small merit. Despite being in his twilight years, he is still willing to contribute his wealth and energy, which truly inspires and impresses us. "The heart of compassion is in all men," this is everyone's business, and we should all stand up and work hard!</p>
<p>Simply maintaining the refugees' lives is not an active solution, nor is it a fundamental one. As the saying goes, "Sitting and eating, the mountain will be empty." People cannot just sit and eat; they must work and produce. Production is the obligation people should fulfill, and it is undoubtedly necessary for refugees to do their best and produce together. However, how to produce? How to maximize production efficiency? These issues need to be studied. In the past, many shelters have also engaged in production work, but with little success, and in a fragmented way. Recognizing this, the association established an education committee to solicit donations and publicly elected leaders in the education field, such as Mr. Xi Yushu, Mr. Chen Heqin, and Mr. Chen Jicheng, as chairmen, along with principals of major and minor schools in the city and prominent figures in the cultural world as standing committee members, preparing to leverage the power of the education and cultural sectors to complete a refugee production education fund of one hundred thousand yuan to solve the refugees' production problems and lay a permanent foundation for them.</p>
<p>Soliciting donations for the refugee production education fund is indeed an opportunity for our education community to serve the refugees. We have hundreds of thousands of students in major and minor schools throughout Shanghai, and nearly ten thousand faculty and staff members. A target of one hundred thousand yuan is the bare minimum, and we sincerely hope to exceed it by fifty thousand, reaching one hundred and fifty thousand. The use of the funds will be determined by soliciting opinions from all sectors and establishing a meticulous organizational design committee to ensure that the funds are not wasted and that significant results are achieved. We hope that all schools at all levels and all members of the cultural community in the city will unite and ensure that everyone participates in this general mobilization, as this is a manifestation of our spirit. At the same time, we also hope that people outside the education community will generously donate as they wish and contribute to this righteous cause because this is the most valuable and meaningful fundraising campaign since August 13th.</p>
<p>The anticipated date of the tenth is fast approaching. This is the only benevolent act to establish a permanent foundation for the refugees. Let the masses unite, work hard, and complete it!</p>
<h3>Educating Refugees</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhicheng</p>
<p>The significance of education lies in assisting the development of mankind to adapt to the evolution of the world. To guide someone on the right path is called teaching; to allow them to grow naturally is called nurturing. There should be no boundaries of poverty or wealth, and no feelings of difficulty or ease. Only when teaching is difficult is there a greater need to teach; only when nurturing is difficult is there a greater need to nurture. If one only educates those who are easy or near, it is certainly not the fundamental purpose of our education.</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every individual": its significance is not limited to the individual alone? It also depends on how those responsible for educating the individual teach and nurture them. If taught properly, the individual can become a pillar of the nation; if taught improperly, even if not an individual of low status, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not become thieves, or even traitors!</p>
<p>Regardless of the past state of Chinese education, what strengths does it reveal to us that can be attributed to past education? What weaknesses are the inevitable responsibility of past education? At this time of the War of Resistance, how should those of us responsible for education act according to our conscience? The only urgent task is to promote refugee production education. However, promoting refugee production education is no easy task. Yet, where our responsibilities and ambitions lie, we must not hesitate. As the saying goes, only when teaching is difficult is there a greater need to teach; only when nurturing is difficult is there a greater need to nurture. It is hoped that the general public will do their best to support the promotion of refugee production education, so that the country can increase its human and material resources, and that refugees will not be tainted by bad habits and endanger the nation. This is not only a matter of our conscience.</p>
<p>Saving one yuan can teach a refugee a skill.</p>

<h3>Following Government Laws</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Our actions naturally prioritize the War of Resistance. Besides direct military actions, those of us, especially in guerrilla areas, can help the war effort by not cooperating with the enemy, which can be considered passive work. Following the laws of our central government, on the other hand, can be considered active work.</p>
<p>Our central government is leading the compatriots of the entire nation in a difficult struggle to achieve the independence and freedom of the country and the nation. All citizens should support it as much as possible, and naturally, they should carry out its laws in everything. However, based on what our eyes and ears have encountered, it seems that some people have not made any effort in this regard, even treating laws with disdain.</p>
<p>The president of a court refused to step down, causing laughter at home and abroad. Fortunately, he made amends afterward, allowing the matter to pass. The double-appointment of principals of provincial schools has been seen repeatedly, and whether it has been completely resolved is probably still brewing. The government wants us to contribute cash and silver, but hoarding is probably rampant. The government controls foreign exchange, but the amount of private foreign exchange purchases is unknown…</p>
<p>If these things happened in guerrilla areas isolated from the central government, where government laws cannot be reached for the time being, it would be understandable. But now they are happening in "isolated islands" where laws still reach and various agencies still exist. If these people are unwilling to be traitors and unwilling to be slaves to a fallen nation, then it cannot be said that they are not walking down the path of traitors and slaves!</p>
<p>Under such oppression from foreign enemies, it is not easy that we still have a government that we like and trust. If we want it to be as stable as Mount Tai, but are unwilling to follow its laws to give it a solid foundation and strong power, isn't that like traveling south by heading north, sabotaging ourselves!</p>
<p>As for those in guerrilla areas, government laws may not always reach directly, but once they are known, I believe that we can only follow them immediately to alleviate the suffering under the enemy's iron hooves.</p>
<p>We compatriots in guerrilla areas, including those on "isolated islands," find it not difficult not to cooperate with the enemy; it is even less difficult to follow the laws of our central government! Why do we still hesitate and wait, or make trouble for ourselves by not actively engaging in this great event that is so effective for the War of Resistance!</p>
<h3>Guest</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>After a drastic change, a large part of the city was burned to the ground. My home was spared, and we lived huddled together. It rained continuously, and the roads outside were full of mud. A man with a beard like spears, muttering to himself, walked back and forth in the rain. Raindrops dripped from his long hair, as if he had climbed out of the river; his appearance was haggard, foolish, and strange. I watched him for a long time from the door, felt sorry for him, and beckoned to him. He blinked his white eyes at me and continued to pace back and forth, ignoring me. My whole family talked about him, but we couldn't figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>As night approached, I looked over there again, but the long shadow was gone. Early the next morning, Dong'er ran in anxiously and said:</p>
<p>"Someone drowned in the pond outside the back door!"</p>
<p>The adults, numbed by the nerves, couldn't muster any emotion for the death of a person; they slowly ran to the pond, where they saw a person lying inside, with two muddy feet still resting on the shore. We tried to lift him up, and it was clearly the strange guest who had been pacing at the door! I suddenly felt a jolt, as if struck by lightning.</p>
<p>I reported it to the district chief, went through the formalities, and no one could identify the deceased. The general conclusion was: not a local.</p>
<p>This small ripple eventually subsided and was gradually forgotten as time passed. A few days later, Lao Zhang, who worked at the district chief's office, came to chat and gave me a stack of documents, saying that they were written by the drowned stranger and found in his pocket. The handwriting was strong, and the sentences were between understandable and incomprehensible. Lao Zhang said, "Read it and then tell me what you think." I looked through them one by one:</p>
<p>You say I am a guest, but are you the hosts?</p>
<p>Although I was not born here, I personally designed this house, I personally arranged this garden, and I personally irrigated these flowers and trees with scoops and buckets of water from the pond. That is my study, and this wall is hung with a couplet I wrote myself. The first line is, "But there is a jade beauty who often catches my eye," and the second line is, "There are no worldly affairs to trouble my heart." These are Wang Cihui's lines, which you wouldn't understand, but I just like these two lines of Wang Cihui. You must think: it is already such a great blessing to have a jade beauty catch your eye, let alone often? I have this blessing. Unfortunately, you thugs forced your way in and drove my jade beauty away; the whole family scattered, and even I was driven away. I couldn't find a place to live on the street, so I ran back, only to be driven out again. Alas. Along the long corridor facing the garden, many horses were tied to the pillars, and you didn't feed them, so they were so hungry that they gnawed on my corridor pillars, gnawing them beyond recognition. Also, my screen, with Qiu Shizhou's paintings on it, was torn down and used for firewood, leaving only a few bare frames thrown in the garden. When I ran back, you wanted to beat me and kill me; you didn't understand what I said, and I didn't understand your nonsense. But you must think: who is the host?</p>
<p>Outside, I was starving. All my acquaintances were dead, and all I met were jackals, widening their eyes to eat me. The weather was also terrible, with heavy rain for days, soaking me to the bone. Alas, if I didn't come back, would you have me die in the street? But you changed your fathers; those fierce and terrifying robbers were gone, and there were no more horses. You all put on pretentious masks, wearing long robes and short jackets, and hung a plaque on my door saying something like "Office of Such-and-Such." I ran in, and you ordered people to stop me at the gatehouse; treating me like a guest, asking me who I wanted to see. Who do I want to see? I am the host! You insisted on treating me like a guest!</p>
<p>I said I was the owner here, and you all laughed and didn't let me in. Looking in from the gatehouse, it seemed there were many well-dressed people, bowing and yielding, talking and laughing in a harmonious manner. It was truly a ghostly scene, truly a ghostly scene!</p>
<p>Is there such a thing in the world? I built the house myself, but I can't live in it myself! You made a mess of everything, but you treated me like a guest, stopping me at the gatehouse! Not allowing me to live here, I can only die. I can't find my relatives; I have nothing to eat; I have no clothes to wear; the thousands of books in my belly cannot be exchanged for food.</p>
<p>Am I to die in the street? I am not reconciled; I must die at home! I want to die in the garden I cultivated myself, I want to sink in my own pond. I will consider it a loss, I can't beat you, and even in death, I will not spare you. You must think: who is the host, and who is the guest?</p>
<p>In the past, there were sons of wealthy families who gambled away the houses left by their ancestors in one game. They drifted away, unable to return home. Alas, I never liked gambling; when did I gamble away this house to you?</p>
<p>I have a belly full of questions, but you refuse to answer them. When I die, you will see that my eyes are wide open...</p>
<p>After I finished reading, I couldn't say anything, and I lowered my head for a long time; Lao Zhang didn't say anything either. I secretly looked at him and saw that he was staring at me with wide eyes.</p>
<h3>Spring Colors Annoy People</h3>
<p>— Wu Yunzuo</p>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>Like a bird flying out of its cage, I left home without any reluctance.</p>
<p>That quiet and gloomy courtyard had consumed my entire twenty years of life, like a caged bird! No, like a convicted criminal, I could not enjoy the joy of freedom.</p>
<p>I wanted to rush out of that gray wall several times.</p>
<p>But I had not yet grown wings that could fly high! My kind mother's tears kept me trapped in the narrow box.</p>
<p>Year after year, a full twenty years! My height has already exceeded that gray wall; the strength of my hands can also push down this old house.</p>
<p>From this time on, my chest has a more restless heart!</p>
<p>Finally, one night, I secretly climbed over that wall and left the old residence where I had lived for twenty years without any pity. My kind mother's tears could no longer hold back the heart of her grown-up son! I am unwilling to waste my future life in this small cage, I want to create a new world of freedom!</p>
<p>At this moment, I am running on the road: like a bird out of its cage, I will never miss the home surrounded by that gray wall!</p>
<h3>Talking About "Not Reading" Again</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>One day five years ago, I happened to meet my fellow villager Mr. Wang XX. At that time, he had just resigned from a certain position in the county government of his hometown and was preparing to devote himself to social work. He said: "I now plan to spend half a day working and half a day reading. Over the years, all the knowledge I have accumulated has been continuously depleted during my service, and it is almost exhausted and outdated. If I don't read anymore, how can I avoid the misfortune of falling behind? So, no matter what, I should now read a few more books to fill my empty mind." Then he asked me to recommend a few books for him to read.</p>
<p>He was already over fifty years old. In fact, he not only had broad knowledge but also rich experience. His spirit of being eager to learn is truly worthy of admiration and imitation by young people! He often said: Those who serve society are most afraid of the famine of knowledge, because the result of famine often leads to intolerable, dogmatic, and blind self-aggrandizement. The ancients often said: "If you excel in officialdom, then study; if you excel in study, then become an official." We should accurately understand its instructions.</p>
<p>We are familiar with the dynamism of Europeans and Americans and their emphasis on the opinions of others! Because they feel that there is no other way to promote progress than learning. Whether they serve in the government or are in retirement, they are equally enthusiastic about public work and learning. Not to mention anything else, it is common for retired ministers over the age of sixty to attend lectures at universities or ask difficult questions. If Mr. Wang XX is compared with them, then Mr. Wang can still be said to be young and strong! This may be the reason why Mr. Wang often reads books to help him develop his career!</p>
<p>Nowadays, a group of young people are succeeding too quickly and are too easily satisfied. Before long, they are appointed to important positions and take on heavy responsibilities. I think they seem too lucky. Forgive me for speaking frankly, their meager knowledge and insufficient training leave them helpless when facing difficulties. Not only that, but most of them are confident that their knowledge is sufficient to handle everything, thinking that there is no need for them to read anymore? This concept is the fatal wound that limits their future progress!</p>
<p>I repeatedly use "falling behind" to warn myself! No matter how busy I am, I have to arrange at least one hour or two hours of reading time every day. Undoubtedly, even fifteen minutes or thirty minutes of reading is very beneficial! We can adopt Dr. Hu Shi's method of using every short period of time to continue reading a book to the end. If you can read three thousand words every day, then you can read ninety thousand words in a month. This work is very easy, and even people over seventy years old can do it! We can unknowingly develop the habit of reading every day. Young people, let's start today, let us all have this habit of reading books.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Both sides had meticulously arranged their plans, though Commander Ye was unaware of the details of One-Eyed Li's arrangements. He even doubted whether One-Eyed Li would dare to attend the banquet after receiving the invitation. To his surprise, the next day he received a reply from One-Eyed Li, saying "I will follow your esteemed command." This greatly surprised Commander Ye, who felt that One-Eyed Li was indeed quite daring. Coincidentally, the sentry captured two suspicious individuals that same day. After personally interrogating them, Commander Ye learned that they were spies sent by One-Eyed Li. However, he decided not to reveal his knowledge, and after feigning a scolding, he released them. He then entered and said to Deputy Commander Liang:</p>
<p>"I think this matter is quite tricky. One-Eyed Li is not easy to deal with. Before he even arrives, he has already sent spies to sneak in and gather information. I could easily kill one to warn a hundred, but that would be counterproductive and alarm him, so I released them. Now we must re-arrange our plans carefully to prevent any slip-ups, lest we let a tiger escape back to the mountains and cause future troubles."</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Liang put his hand on his head and pondered for a while, saying:</p>
<p>"Commander, it was good that you released the spies he sent. However, I have one concern. Now that they have done this, they will surely send more people on the appointed day, and may even bring weapons. If we ignore them at that time, we will only add to his strength. But if we try to cut off his wings, I fear he will not come to the banquet. What should we do?"</p>
<p>"Therefore, we must carefully arrange our plans, first to prevent him from escaping this gate, and second to prevent him from escaping Hepu Town."</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Commander Ye lowered his voice and whispered the plan he had just thought of to Deputy Commander Liang, who nodded in approval.</p>
<p>The appointed date of the banquet arrived. Because Commander Ye had strictly prohibited the leakage of information beforehand, the atmosphere in the town was still the same as usual. Only the inside of the Township Office was particularly tense. Commander Ye had meticulously arranged three ambushes inside the Township Office: the first was behind the screen in the main hall, the second was in the left and right wing rooms of the main hall, and the third was in the left and right side rooms at the gate. Each ambush was equipped with about ten brave personal soldiers. As for the outside arrangements, they were even more strict. Although the troops were told not to interfere with those who were suspicious, they had to closely monitor their actions. (25)</p>

<h3>The Explosion of the Osaka Arsenal</h3>
<p>— (Ge'er)</p>
<p>The Japanese army arsenal in the Maida area of Osaka exploded! This is not, as the Tokyo telegram said, something like "Careless handling of gunpowder during transport." This is a firm and unwavering response from the Japanese people with a sense of justice, those whom the Kyoto Metropolitan Police Department recognizes as so-called "traitors to Japan," to their own country's fascist militarists!</p>
<p>In the twenty months of the Japanese fascist militarists' invasion of China, we have seen countless tragedies occur in the Japanese army. The widespread increase in war-weariness is truly growing with each passing day. As reported the other day: "The Northern China Japanese Army Headquarters recently conducted an ideological test on the Japanese troops stationed in Peiping, Tianjin, and sent to Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shandong to fight against the guerrillas, to observe their attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War. The results showed that 38% of the Japanese soldiers expressed war-weariness, most of whom felt that continuing to fight would be fruitless, so they hoped to return to Japan as soon as possible to engage in peaceful life." This is a good example. Other examples include the widespread anti-war sentiment in colonies such as Korea and Taiwan, the "voluntary resignation" of a large number of professors at Tokyo Imperial University due to the arrest of the liberal economist Professor Eijiro Kawai, and the sudden "shaving of his head to become a monk" by a Japanese general who had commanded operations in China. There were also violent riots in Kanto South Bu-machi and Ohtsubo, Japan, on the 17th of last month due to conscription. All of these are simply too numerous to list! And all of these are precisely the explosions of "arsenals" that are accumulating in their hearts! This explosion of the "arsenals" that are accumulating in their hearts has today caused the explosion of the army arsenal in the Maida area of Osaka, and tomorrow it will undoubtedly cause the explosion of all of Japan's arsenals!</p>
<p>However, what is most important and absolutely cannot be ignored is that we must understand: the explosion of the army arsenal in the Maida area of Osaka can be said to be a great, silent bomb launched by our Chinese protracted war of resistance! That is to say: only by continuing our protracted war of resistance in accordance with what our great leader Chairman Chiang has shown us, "not compromising halfway," will the Japanese fascist militarists collapse under our strong resistance and the explosions of all the arsenals in Japan caused by our strong protracted war of resistance!</p>
<p>We must continue our protracted war of resistance and not compromise halfway, and we will see the explosion of even greater military arsenals in Japan!</p>
<h3>The Photographer Saves the Day</h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>"Sharpshooters"</p>
<p>Produced by 20th Century Fox, screening at the Great Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>"The Photographer Saves the Day" tells the story of how a news photographer bravely saves the young ruler of the Kingdom of Madavenia and captures the rebellious ministers who plotted to usurp the throne. With car chases, airplane rescues, and crowd scenes interspersed, and naturally, an indispensable romance, the film becomes a so-called "thrilling comedy."</p>
<p>However, the director focuses on the "thrilling comedy" part, such as the photographer Steve taking pictures of the prince's flying skills on the plane; Steve's machine-powered bicycle crashing wildly as he rushes to the plane; Steve's escape when he is mistaken for an assassin; the prince strafing with the plane; Diane being imprisoned; the crown prince escaping; and finally the crowd's frenzy, Steve rescuing the prince; these continuous stimuli and thrilling scenes are quite "exciting" to watch; but this is the common disease of all comedies, these scenes are connected by "coincidence." However, the fact that it doesn't have a happy ending is the smartest thing.</p>
<p>But "The Photographer Saves the Day" unintentionally gave us a hint: the conspirators who usurp the throne are not only Count Orloff, but Marquis Matim, whom Steve and Diane trust, is the "real culprit." Therefore, before all conspiracies are exposed, it is impossible to see the faces of those "conspirators," and after the conspiracies are exposed, the remnants must be eliminated to avoid leaving seeds of disaster and the recurrence of conspiracies. At the same time, it also points out that the power of the people is the greatest power.</p>
<h3>Those Who Eat from a Golden Bowl: The Life of a Bank Clerk</h3>
<p>— A Bank Employee</p>
<p>(3) Daily Life and Work</p>
<p>The daily work is monotonous. From nine in the morning to four or five in the afternoon, one cannot be without a pen and abacus all day long. "Preparing vouchers," "matching seals," "entering accounts," and "compiling various reports" are the daily routine. It looks easy, but in fact, one must "handle it carefully," especially those working in the business department, who must be "cautious," because the business department is the forefront of the bank, and those working on the front line represent the bank directly in its relationship with customers. Any mistake or conflict can easily give customers a "bad impression," which in turn affects the bank's business and future. Because banks need customers, and more customers, without customers, the bank cannot exist. If the staff in the business department are deficient in any way towards customers, or unable to understand and cooperate, the bank's future will be in jeopardy. This is what managers and directors worry about the most and are most unwilling to see. Therefore, they mediate between the bank managers and the customers, needing to be "thorough in all aspects," neither arrogant nor humble, always striving to satisfy every customer, while also pleasing the manager. Therefore, bank managers and directors pay special attention to the business department staff, especially regarding "modesty of character" and "agility of skills." Furthermore, when they get busy, they often don't even have time for lunch, and it's common for them to eat after one o'clock in the afternoon. The suffering involved is indeed beyond what outsiders can imagine.</p>
<p>Those who work in the accounting department are relatively more relaxed; they are responsible for reviewing the work done by the business department yesterday. And the auditing department is responsible for assessing various reports from the entire bank and compiling the bank's accounts, with its duties above those of the accounting department. In addition, the internal general affairs department includes sections such as correspondence, personnel, and general services. Those who do this kind of work are not necessarily from the financial world, and their work seems relatively leisurely, but their "airs" are a bit grander than those in other departments. They all have considerable "status," especially the head of the personnel department, who manages the personnel of the entire bank, and the rewards, punishments, promotions, and dismissals of all bank employees are in his hands.</p>
<p>Once the daily work is over, it's their time to be active. At this time, those with high incomes ride motorcycles, eat Western food, and frequent dance halls and other entertainment venues; they truly "spend money like water," fully displaying the "airs" of those who "eat from a golden bowl." Those with low incomes, only a few dozen or a few tens of yuan per month, if their family finances are not wealthy, and they still feel compelled to put on the "appearance" of a bank employee, then "living beyond their means" and being "in dire straits" with mounting debts is not uncommon. There is also another type of person, with very low income, who is not particular about food and clothing, and you can't tell from their appearance that they are "eating from a golden bowl." After office hours, they relax in the dormitory or club, or bury themselves in the library. These people are mostly trainees or junior assistants. As each person's "lifestyle" differs, the bank produces all sorts of different people. The romantic and elegant are certainly bank employees, but the pessimistic and dejected, and even those who change careers, are also bank employees. Those with the greatest hope, the widest opportunities, and the easiest success are also bank employees.</p>
<p>All are bank employees: some fail, some succeed, "failure and success are determined by one's own efforts"; bank employees have a special awareness of this - especially "young bank employees," although "connections" still influence the status of bank employees today. (The End)</p>
<h3>A Record of the 50th Troop of Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>— A He</p>
<p>The name "Boy Scout" was created in 1908 by British Army Lieutenant General Robert Baden-Powell, and has a history of more than thirty years. Its purpose is to train boys in skills such as transmitting signals, scouting, field trips, and observing things, in order to cultivate the virtues of loyalty, kindness, independence, courage, and perseverance. Its intention is truly worthy of our promotion; therefore, in almost every corner of the world today, there are such military-style group organizations that unite boys.</p>
<p>Speaking of China's Boy Scouts, the history is not short. Most people in society today know about the term "Boy Scout." And in terms of the Boy Scouts themselves, they have indeed done a lot of great and earth-shattering work, and the profound impression they have given us cannot be erased. The reason why Boy Scouts today receive countless praises and approvals in society is, without saying, created by each Boy Scout himself.</p>
<p>The Boy Scouts in this city, in the past or in the present, have been quite honorable, and everything has given people good satisfaction. For minor matters, whenever there are gatherings or ceremonies that need them to come out to maintain order, they are always so enthusiastic and sincere; for major matters, such as after the outbreak of the January 28th and August 13th incidents, they also bravely participated in various rescue and transportation works. In the battles outside Nanjing, the breakthrough in Xuzhou, the destruction in Wuhan, the fall of Guangzhou, and the fire in Changsha, the Boy Scouts of this city have left many great achievements.</p>
<p>Among the Boy Scout troops in this city, the 50th Troop is the most meritorious and worthy of our admiration. During the January 28th incident, four Boy Scouts from the troop, including Mao Zhengxiang, risked their lives in and out of the hail of bullets and died in service; later, a memorial stone tablet was erected on the open space of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with the names and brief biographies of the four martyrs engraved on it, as a memorial to them. After the August 13th incident began, their work became even more tense, touching, and valuable than before. Below, let me report to you, the readers, what I know about the situation of this troop. (Those already seen in yesterday's local news section of this newspaper are omitted.)</p>
<p>When the war was raging in the surrounding areas near Shanghai, they served in various military hospitals until the national army retreated westward, and then it stopped. But they still organized the so-called "Pathfinder First Aid Team" to risk going to the front lines to rescue the wounded soldiers and refugees.</p>
<p>Later, they also followed the army from Shanghai through Suzhou, Nanjing, Changsha to Hankou to transport various medical supplies. At the same time, they transported wounded soldiers from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang. After the great fire in Changsha, their headquarters moved to Qiyang to prepare an outline for serving in the rear. At present, their staff are distributed in thirteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Yunnan. According to their latest service report, from August 13, 1937, to the end of 1938, they traveled a total of 630,000 kilometers and escorted more than 70,000 soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>The 50th Troop of Boy Scouts was organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and those who participated in the service were all professional young people around the age of twenty; for the sake of the motherland's fate, they were all willing to abandon their sweet families and go to the inland to fight and do difficult work. Recently, a person named Cang Chengquan (formerly employed by the Longmen Bookstore and Chunsheng Sporting Goods Company in this city) died of malaria in the Central Hospital in Guiyang while escorting medicines through Guiyang—this great spirit of sacrificing one's life for the country is truly worthy of our admiration and emulation!</p>
<p>Young friends on the isolated island! After reading about the deeds of the 50th Troop of Boy Scouts, what are your thoughts? Do you feel ashamed? Please rise up quickly and replace peaceful singing and dancing with hard and continuous work!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Spring Arrives in Biluo Fragrance Floating over a Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly on Tiger Hill, the Moon Fills Li Lake</p>
<p>He Shuangyu said, "Then does Stone Lake also have tides?" Junsu said, "This place is farther from the sea, so you don't feel the tides. But according to old legends, on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, the night when the tide is at its highest, you can go to Stone Lake. The Suzhou people's viewing of the 'string of moons' is because the water in the lake is rippling in the bridge holes due to the influence of the night tide, but I think this statement still needs to be studied. However, Stone Lake borders Tai Lake and is surrounded by villages, so it can't be as quiet as West Lake, nor can it be exclusively a tourist area like West Lake. Look! We haven't been sitting here for half an hour, and there have been more than a dozen small motorboats and steamers passing by, all heading to other towns, which shows that this place is a thoroughfare." He Liyu said, "There aren't many tourists here. Look, many yachts are also idle. Yesterday we were in Shanghai, and Sister Jin Danyun accompanied us to the Martyrs' Cemetery in Dachang, and there were many tourists there. After all, Shanghai is a commercial port, and Suzhou is inland, right?" Wu Junsu took a sip of tea and nodded, saying, "Shanghai's population is indeed too dense. Statistics now show that there are seven million people, double the number before the war. But there were many tourists at the Martyrs' Cemetery yesterday because yesterday was Sunday. Wasn't I in Shanghai yesterday too? It's true that Shanghai is so prosperous that it should be decentralized. In the past, Shanghai's population was smaller than Tokyo, Japan. Recently, Shanghai's population rate has not only exceeded Tokyo's population rate, but also exceeded Berlin's population rate in Germany. Naturally, Suzhou is far less prosperous than Shanghai, but because today is Monday. Suzhou is not like it used to be, with too many leisurely friends. Everyone has something to do. Workers work, farmers farm, students study, and there is no more idleness like before. It's not a day of rest, so you're not allowed to play. Even young people can't be like the young masters and young ladies before the war, that's impossible." He Shuangyu said, "How were they like young masters and young ladies? Sister Airen is also from Suzhou, and she has never mentioned it." Wu Junsu said, "Sister Airen lives in the countryside, and she has worked hard since she was a child, so she wouldn't know. I live in the city, so let me tell you two sisters, my family is a large clan, and we have been officials for generations. We have fields, land, real estate, and businesses. Although we can't be considered extremely wealthy, we can be counted among the top families. I was young at that time, so I didn't enjoy the life of a young master or young lady, but I have seen how comfortable and leisurely they were." (53)</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Old Operas (6)</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>Why do I use this analogy? Because I always feel that the old opera is like Liu Adou. Although he can't be supported, he is still a king on the throne. Others who claim to reform the old opera cannot become the orthodox. To all those who fantasize about reforming the old opera, I still advise them to give up this ambition and create a new category. For example, "bengbeng opera" and "Southern opera" are smarter. There is no need to borrow the name of the old opera, which makes it neither fish nor fowl. Didn't I say that the old opera is like a newly unearthed bronze tripod or Shang sacrificial vessel, but the new era does not need it? It can be used for caressing and admiring. If you use an axe to try to turn it into a daily utensil and use it, then you become a fool.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I had an opportunity to have a ten-day talk with Professor Zhang Pengchun on the issue of drama. When it came to the future of the old opera, he completely agreed with my views. Now, I will take the opinions he supplemented as the conclusion of this article:</p>
<p>The old opera is a groundbreaking and glorious achievement in Chinese art. It has its own indelible value in history. However, the wheels of time are progressing too fast, and the old opera has lost all its audience because it cannot keep up, so it is becoming increasingly weak and its future is bleak. Although some people want to use "reform" to save it, it is getting worse and worse. I am afraid that the little essence inherent in the old opera is in danger of being lost. Since the War of Resistance, spoken drama and film have been working hard for the country, but the old opera has been hiding in the rear, only providing entertainment for the idle class, without making any contribution. After the victory of the War of Resistance, when it comes to rewarding merits, the old opera will not only have no share, but will also be forgotten and despised by the general new youth. But even so, the old opera will not easily disappear, because of its artistic status. I hope that soon the overall situation will be settled, and when it comes to reconstruction and construction, the central government can imitate the method of the National Art Museum and set up a National Opera Museum, recruit and concentrate all the old opera talents, and make collections, preservation, organization, and research. A school should also be attached to cultivate talents, and any discoveries should be published in books; occasionally, public performances should be held for the observation and study of true old opera lovers. At the same time, the gramophone and film should be used as much as possible to record the acting skills of those surviving veteran actors and artists and store them in the museum so that a generation of national treasures will not be lost without a trace. In this way, it is better to close the old opera in an ivory tower, so as to avoid it being exposed outside, being eroded by wind and rain, and being eliminated in shame; I think this is better than "reform" and "progress." Some people will definitely scold me for being pedantic, but where is the pedantry? "Ancient" things are originally not bad to "play" with. (The End)</p>
<h3>Film Industry Trends</h3>
<p>— Dai Er</p>
<p>Dreaming of U.S. Dollars and Weekly Salaries</p>
<p>Xinhua Company is currently the largest organization in the Chinese film industry. Its recent takeover by the American China United Film Company came suddenly and has attracted much attention from society. It is said that the American company has strong capital and is preparing to expand the scale of film production. On March 1, hundreds of people from the company gathered and unanimously resolved to join the new American company. The next day, they published a notice in various newspapers. This cannot be said to be the biggest event in the film industry in recent years.</p>
<p>After the meeting that day, the male and female actors of Xinhua were strolling and chatting in the Lilac Garden film studio. The more they talked, the more excited they became. Person A said, "From today onwards, the salary we receive may become American dollars." Person B said, "Not only will we be paid in U.S. dollars, but we may also change from monthly salaries to weekly salaries according to Hollywood's practice." Person C said, "When the American bosses see that we have worked hard, they may give each of us a house and a car." It's really wishful thinking and daydreaming. If dreams can come true, these employees will be wealthy enough. For example, those who used to have a monthly salary of one hundred yuan will now have one hundred U.S. dollars a week. According to the current exchange rate, one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for more than six legal tender yuan. Even calculated at six yuan, they can get 2,400 legal tender yuan per month. What a considerable amount.</p>
<p>Raising Film Prices Calculated in Hong Kong Dollars</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the sales market for domestic films has shrunk a lot. The inland provinces cannot be reached, and the largest market is still the Nanyang Islands. In recent years, foreign exchange rates have soared, and one foreign currency yuan in Singapore and Luzon can be exchanged for more than three legal tender yuan, but the purchase price of films is still calculated at the old price. This is naturally the film merchants taking advantage and the film producers suffering losses. In order to make up for this deficiency, recently, film producers such as Xinhua, Yihua, and Guohua have decided to unanimously switch to selling in Hong Kong dollars, and will not depreciate prices to seek cash. For example, a copy that used to sell for 2,000 legal tender yuan will now sell for 2,000 Hong Kong dollars. With the same 2,000 yuan, the exchange rate adds an additional 1,600 or 1,700 yuan. Since the implementation, film merchants have unconditionally agreed. The film industry has benefited a lot from this subsidy.</p>
<p>However, the staff complained and said, "It's good to calculate the price of the films in Hong Kong dollars, but why don't you pay us in Hong Kong dollars too?"</p>
<p>But the film producers also have their own difficulties, and the staff should just focus on working and not think too much about cheap calculations.</p>
<p>Domestic Blockbusters Have Long Runs</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year has been over for half a month, but the three domestic costume blockbusters that premiered on New Year's Eve are still going on calmly, and there seems to be no movement to replace them with new films for the time being. The enthusiasm of Chinese people for welcoming domestic films and loving domestic goods can be seen. On the other hand, several theaters that show first-run Western films have already changed to new films several times. Each new film is only shown for three or four days, and the audience is not enthusiastic. It is a world of difference from the grand occasion of Shanghai Guang's "Mulan Joins the Army," which has four or five shows a day, with every show fully booked, and tickets must be bought a day in advance. No wonder foreign film merchants feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Some people say: Western films can only sprint, while domestic films are long-distance running experts.</p>
<p>Americans Inquire about Purchasing "Mulan"</p>
<p>"Mulan Joins the Army" is expected to run for more than two months. As of now, it has been less than half a month, and the profit has reached more than 160,000 yuan. At the same time, it is also premiering in Hong Kong. The film price is naturally calculated in Hong Kong dollars. Recently, American film merchants have wanted to buy the U.S. screening rights of Mulan, but the Huacheng authorities are unwilling to quote a price at this time and must wait until Shanghai Guang is finished before they can estimate the price. There is no doubt that the future profits of this film will exceed "Diao Chan."</p>
<h3>Xiantan Society Finds a New Venue - Performing Matinee Shows at the Xianle Grand Theater - Contract Signed and Starting Today</h3>
<p>— Yu Sheng</p>
<p>The only surviving Kun opera troupe—Xianni Society—originally affiliated with the Oriental Theater inside the Oriental Hotel, performing one show daily from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm. The contract expired at the end of last lunar year. The Oriental originally wanted Xianni Society to renew the contract, but Xianni Society requested the deletion of the clause "all actors can only be increased, not decreased." The Oriental owner refused, and the two sides argued without resolution, so it was not continued in the Xinmao New Year.</p>
<p>Since leaving the Oriental Theater, Xianni Society has begun looking for a new venue. It once contacted the Dahua Ballroom on Marlborough Road, intending to perform matinee shows in the ballroom, but the permit could not be obtained, and most members believed that the location of the Dahua Ballroom was not suitable for performing Kun opera, so it was abandoned.</p>
<p>Now, as a result of Zhang Chuanfang's efforts, Xianni Society has successfully negotiated with the Xianle Grand Theater, run by Wang Junda and Wang Meiyu. Xianle's spoken drama performs matinee shows until 5:30 pm, and the evening show starts at 8:00 pm. The two hours from 5:45 pm to 7:45 pm in between are decided to be given to Xianni Society to perform one show. The ticket sales will be split equally between Xianni Society and Xianle, and the advertising fees and electricity fees will be borne by Xianle. The contract was signed on the evening of the 3rd, with Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang as the authorized representatives of Xianni Society. Starting today, the Lantern Festival, they will begin performing on stage. The programs for the three days are arranged as follows:</p>
<p>(5th) Adding Officials, Looking in the Mirror, Qin Tiao Zui Fei, Wu Song</p>
<p>(6th) Night Flight, Dog Hole, Peony Pavilion (Touring the Garden, Piling Flowers, Eulogizing Flowers, Startling Dream)</p>
<p>(7th) Full Version of Qianyuan Mountain, Full Version of Selling Horses</p>

<p>Game 26: One Man Guards the Pass</p>
<p>Proposed by Yan Wangshu, a 14-year-old</p>
<p>Red Moves First to Win</p>
<p>Summary of the Red Winning Strategy for Game 15:</p>
<p>Elephant 5 advances 7, Chariot 8 advances 2, Elephant 3 advances 5, Chariot 8 moves to 9, Elephant 5 retreats 7</p>
<p>Chariot 9 moves to 8, General 5 advances 1, Chariot 8 moves to 9, General 5 moves to 4, Chariot 9 retreats 2</p>
<p>Chariot 5 retreats 1, Chariot 9 moves to 8, Chariot 4 retreats 1, Chariot 8 moves to 9, General 4 moves to 5</p>
<p>Chariot 9 advances 3, Chariot 4 moves to 8, Chariot 9 moves to 4, Chariot 8 advances 2, Chariot 4 retreats 2</p>
<p>Elephant 7 advances 9, Horse 6 advances 8, Chariot 5 moves to 3, Horse 8 retreats 6, Chariot 3 advances 3</p>
<p>East 4 moves to 1, Chariot 3 moves to 4, Chariot 1 moves to 4, General 5 advances 1, Chariot 4 moves to 1</p>
<p>Chariot 8 retreats 2, Chariot 1 moves to 4, Chariot 8 moves to 4</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ji Xin, there are still many variations on Xin Yi's move, but it is no more than Red wins, which is the key to the game. After the twenty-seventh move, Chariot 3 moves to 4, Chariot 1 moves to 4, General 5 advances 1, is the most urgent move to force Chariot 4 to move to 1, and then 8 retreats 2, so that the Chariot cannot move, and if it moves, it will be killed in the heart, and then 8 moves to 4 to win.</p>
<h3>Recording the Small Rehearsal of the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society</h3>
<p>— Piao Wai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank has long established a Peking Opera Society to promote the proper entertainment of its colleagues, and its history is very long. It was once suspended after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. It was revived in the winter of last year. On the first day of this month, they held their first small-scale rehearsal. The writer ran to the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society on Renji Road at 7 pm that evening. It was an ordinary office that had been transformed, half of it used as a stage and half arranged with seats. On the walls hung the rules for learning opera and the program for today's performance, etc. Although the stage was very small, there were also two spotlights in front of the stage, and there were railings and electric lights on the side of the stage. It can be said to be specific and subtle, with complete equipment.</p>
<p>Most of those who watched the play that day were colleagues from their own bank and family members of the actors. Looking at everyone's faces, they were all smiling with joy. There was also a guest who was holding a camera box and constantly squinting his eyes to take stage photos. There were a total of four plays rehearsed that day: "Golden Platform—"Joining the Army and Bidding Farewell to the Kiln," "Zhang Yi Obtains Reality," and the finale was "Yutang Spring," from the start of the escort to the final trial. Because the writer arrived very late, "Golden Platform" was about to end at this time. Only seeing Yi Li's majestic appearance and Tian Dan's elegant acting, it was a pity not to see Jin Bao. When Xue Pinggui appeared on stage in "Joining the Army and Bidding Farewell to the Kiln," there was a lot of acting, and the expression of parting with Wang Baochuan was also good. Mr. Chen Shide put a lot of effort into his performance, without being sloppy at all; paired with Ms. Tao Qiongzhi's Baochuan, her singing and acting were even and quiet, which was quite fitting. It is said that this was their first time on stage, so this result is truly not easy. In the third play, "Zhang Yi Obtains Reality," Mr. Shi Bingyong played Kang Shi, with his singing skills being experienced and his tone loud, which won a lot of applause from the audience; and the clown Zhang Yi, with his smiling face and comical appearance, made the whole play more lively and interesting. The last play was "Yutang Spring." Mr. Shen Weining's former Su San and Mr. Pu Siluo's Chong Gongdao were both very serious in their singing and acting, following the rules and regulations, and their demeanor was very stable from beginning to end, truly a model for beginners. The latter Su San was played by Mr. Yang Shuomin, who had a beautiful appearance, but his figure was a little timid; his acting was also good. When he appeared on stage, he was quite imposing, but it was a pity that the stage was too small, and there were too many people in the three-hall trial, so although there were stage steps, there was no room for performance. The singing throughout the whole scene was steady and experienced, and there was still a lingering sound after each song, with quite a bit of Mei School style, and the clear pronunciation was especially commendable. The other roles were also very competent in their singing and acting, worthy of being the finale.</p>
<p>Usually, in theater rehearsals, amateur actors only play the main roles and supporting roles, and the rest are filled by the company's actors. However, this time, in the Shanghai Bank's rehearsal, it was not the case. From the main roles to the extras, they were all played by the amateur actors themselves; even the cymbal playing, the violin playing, and the hatred were all made up by the bank employees. This has never been seen in past rehearsals. This spirit of common entertainment, singing and acting by oneself, is really commendable.</p>
<p>It is said that they have a practice rehearsal once a month, and when they are proficient, they are also prepared to perform publicly, sell tickets to help the disaster, so this is really killing two birds with one stone: it is both an extracurricular interest for the employees, and it is also pleading for the victims and providing relief. Although it is entertainment, it has not lost the ancient people's original intention of "treating people as brothers and cherishing all things."</p>
<h3>The Sino-French Drama School Holds Regular Public Performances</h3>
<p>The Sino-French Drama School is scheduled to hold its first practical public performance from March 11th to 13th. The programs include "Poppy Flower," directed by Wu Xiaobang and composed by Chen Gexin. The play participated in the Spring Festival performance of the Shanghai Drama Society and received good reviews from the audience. "Pretentiousness," originally by the French Molière, translated and compiled by Feng Zhizhong, is a satirical comedy directed by Xu Xingzhi. "Little Hero," written by Xu Xingzhi and directed by Wu Xiaobang, is a fairy tale drama with correct consciousness and exciting plot. The location is the Grand Auditorium of the French Engineering Bureau, No. 11 Huanlong Road, French Concession.</p>
<h3>"Doll Dance" Viewing Notes</h3>
<p>— Le Tian</p>
<p>A Three-Year-Old Girl Actually Performs on Stage, Singing and Dancing with Utmost Charm</p>
<p>Among the various performing arts in Shanghai, they have developed in a distorted manner, but musical theatre remains deeply silent, with no one paying attention. Perhaps it is because the impression given by the former girl singing and dancing troupes was unfavorable to the general public, so everyone has become indifferent. Recently, I inadvertently heard a friend mention a pair of little sister flowers, who were very young but could sing and dance well. Driven by curiosity, I specially stepped into the Senlo Dance Palace the night before last. At about ten o'clock, under a pink electric torch, the two little dance stars appeared on the stage, and all the guests stood up, truly looking at them with new eyes. Their first program was "Doll Dance," their voices were round and smooth, and their dance moves were light and lively, as if they were very skilled. The most interesting thing was the younger one, who walked with a swaying gait. To describe her smallness, she was like a baby in her mother's arms, but the songs she sang and the dances she danced were strangely sophisticated. In the ten minutes of the performance, no flaws could be seen. Although this is said to be talent, one cannot ignore the hard work of the coach. Then she stood on a chair and sang a song directly into the microphone, which was also very moving, winning a full house of applause.</p>
<p>Later, thanks to Mr. Xie Baosheng's introduction, I talked with their teacher, Mr. Yang Mingxin, for five minutes before I learned that the older sister's name was Lu Jiafeng, with the stage name Yang Nannan (Foreign Girl), and the younger sister was Lu Jiahuan, with the stage name Yang Wawa (Foreign Doll). "Feng" and "Huang" (Phoenix) of the Lu family, named "Nannan" and "Wawa," can be considered wonderfully appropriate. Speaking of child stars, Shanghai has Chen Juanjuan and Wu Rongrong, and Hollywood has Shirley Temple and Kim Hye-soo, but they debuted at the age of ten or older, while these two sisters are five years old and thirty-two months old, respectively, and can actually perform singing and dancing on stage. Don't you think it's amazing?</p>
<p>Mr. Yang said that he started coaching them a month before the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident. He imagined teaching her to sing while she was breastfeeding. This kind of enlightenment work is really not easy. If you don't have patience and a deep understanding of children's psychology, you wouldn't dare to try it. In the past twenty months, they have learned more than a dozen singing and dancing programs and can perform on stage. Generally, children have bad habits, such as liking to eat sweets, eating snacks, not listening to instructions, and not knowing etiquette. The Lu family's Yang Nannan, whom he taught, has already eliminated these bad habits, so she can maintain the conditions for healthy beauty.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang has been engaged in coaching children's singing and dancing as a profession. He has served as a coach for many singing and dancing troupes and amusement park singing and dancing classes. Chen Juanjuan was the first one he successfully trained. Now he plans to prepare a singing and dancing troupe, recruiting children between the ages of three and ten as members, and appear in society with a brand-new posture. In his early years, he worked as a kindergarten teacher for seven years, so he has the interest and experience in coaching young children. I also hope that he will show his housekeeping skills and open up a bright path for general talented children or suffering children.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (121)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Secret Story of the Temple of Yue Fei Being Occupied by Taoist Priests</p>
<p>People who have lived in the old capital for a long time have no vitality and are extremely lifeless. Everyone embraces the principle of sweeping the snow in front of their own door, fearing that leaves will hit their heads when walking under trees. When it comes to patriotic thought and group organization, that is simply not what they want to hear. Although the number of people in the Pear Garden industry accounts for a large number in Ping City, ranking first among all cities in the country, their solidarity is even more weak and pitiful. Therefore, tens of thousands of temple properties and the Yue Fei Temple, which has a history of more than a hundred years, were actually seized without any effort. Because of my love for archaeology, I took the opportunity of traveling to Ping and asked a friend to introduce me, so I was able to freely view the relics of the temple and learned the beginning and end of the construction and occupation from an old actor, so I specially narrated it. This also shows that people in the acting world themselves are letting go of their rights and do not know how to preserve the various undertakings in the temple created by their predecessors with great difficulty, which is really a very regrettable thing.</p>
<p>The great boss Cheng Changgeng, because his personality, morality, and skills were all above his peers, he took the position of the head of the Sanqing Troupe and concurrently managed the affairs of the Sixi, Chuntai, and Hechun, the four major Anhui troupes. At that time, all the talented people in the acting world in the old capital who had a slight reputation belonged to the four major Anhui troupes. Since Changgeng had already taken the lead of the four troupes, the position of the head of the Yue Fei Temple undoubtedly belonged to him. The acting world of that temple had very rich income, and there was a forest of famous actors. In addition to the imperial court, the mansions of princes and nobles often sent errands, and the extra income was also considerable. Therefore, funds were raised to build the Yue Fei Temple on an open space south of Xizhushikou outside Qianmen. The temple gate faces west to east, and there is a large stage inside the gate, which also faces east. The west, north, and south sides are all multi-story buildings. When performing, female guests all sit upstairs. Small doors are opened on both sides of the second gate, leading to the north and south side courtyards. The south courtyard is about four times larger than the north courtyard. Inside the second gate, there are two north and south side rooms each, three main halls, and three rooms each in the two corridors. They have now been rebuilt into multi-story buildings, magnificent and majestic, filled with antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, as a place for the Taoist priests who look after the temple to cultivate tranquility. Behind the main hall is a vast garden with many trees, flowers, and plants. In addition to this temple, several acres of public burial land were also purchased, attached to the temple, with several city houses and several hectares of good land attached to the outer city. Every year, in addition to the membership fees paid by Huichang, the income from rent and food alone was enough for all the expenses of the temple and more.</p>
