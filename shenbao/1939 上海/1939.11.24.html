<h3 id="c10">美國蘇聯與遠東 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>遠東秩序之恢復，和平之奠定，事在中國與日本；而最能助成之者，莫若美國與蘇聯。蓋遠東之秩序與和平，本無問題，問題在日本之侵略；抵抗侵略者中國，而美蘇則具有鼓勵侵略或遏止侵略之力量。</p>
<p>美國態度至鮮明，祇以行動不能果斷，雖憎惡侵略，而兩年來對日供給大量物資，事實上遂爲鼓勵侵略者；及至最近半載，輿情漸成熟，態度由鮮明而趨於堅決。他不具論，一週以來，彼副國務卿威爾斯氏剴切表示者三度：（一）本月十七日，向報界發表談話，指斥日方所謂美國政府準備承認中國新局勢說之妄。（二）二十一日，根據天津現象，闡明美國政府宣布廢止美日商的後之一貫政策。（三）二十二日，復因日本散佈美日開始談判新商的之空氣，辭以闢之；不但謂華盛頓與東京兩地，俱未進行談判，且聲明商的至明年一月二十六日失效，不再重訂。此外，美國於明年一月後，種種對日行動之準備，亦美國朝野所聚精會神以赴之。美國之態度，足使國際對於是非善惡之觀念爲之澄淸，足使侵略者欺妄世界之意念有所憬悟；是必有裨於遏止侵略，有裨於遠東之恢復秩序，奠定和平者也。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯，兩年半以來，援華甚厚；祇以國際其他問題所映射，雖在　人，猶於議論國際，涉及蘇聯之時，輒謂國際惟蘇聯之意念行動爲最小可捉摸；此在侵略國家，允不絕其妄念，希冀蘇聯竟受脅誘而對於侵略能予容忍，或且濟其惡。</p>
<p>夫請蘇聯最不可捉摸，誠吾人論斷之識見不足歟？抑蘇聯政策之高深莫測歟？檢討三閱月來，蘇聯所表見於國際者，誰曾逆覩之事前？估量自今而後，蘇聯將發動於國際者，誰得預言其動嚮？然則謂爲不可捉摸，洵屬不誣。原國家之國際政策，應磊落光明，與人共見共聞，如美國，允如半年以來之美國乎？抑應機杼玄默，令人不可捉摸，如蘇聯，允如三閱月以來之蘇聯乎？其是非短長，各有契分，宜未可一槪論。如蘇聯有志於波蘭，而得志於德國鋒鏑之餘，此實意念行動不可捉摸之收穫也。倘若不然蘇聯「務使白俄羅斯人與烏克蘭人解脫波蘭豪紳梏桎一之宣言，使白族烏族赤化之圖謀，公開標揭之於若干歲月之前，則波蘭是否不爲德義軸心之附庸？是否不爲反共公約而吶喊？德國攻勢取何方向？歐洲局勢成何形態？凡此數端，雖屬永無答案之疑問，類是之疑問允不知其凡幾；然絕無疑問者，蘇聯未能以死傷赤軍二千六百人爲代價而擴土二十萬公方里，是可斷言也。故蘇聯政策之不可捉摸，是爲蘇聯對付歐洲計之，雖謂因時因事而制宜可也。遠東逈殊於歐洲，問題之性質殊，內容之繁簡殊，所影響於前途者亦殊；况以蘇聯援華之厚，宜不復以蘇聯對遠柬爲不可捉摸；則有數因焉，可爲視聽之障，可爲心理之魔，遂成爲遠東問題中視聽與心理上之黑影。一因蘇聯有取於波蘭，乃予人以領土野心之契合；二因蘇聯袒德國而不滿於吳法，乃啟人以操縱其間之企圖；三因蘇聯於攻訐資本主義國家之際，語侵美國，乃示人以蘇美問亦有可蹈之間隙；四因滿蒙間停戰協定之簽訂，蘇日擬訂商的之提示，乃使人疑爲凡百皆有妥協之可能；五因蘇聯三閱月以來之作爲，使人信爲行將大舉於歐洲，爰謀刦持於遠東。凡此種種，蘇聯援華雖厚，而所予遠東以視聽與心理上之黑影，則及近頃而愈强烈，愈活躍。黑影所在，侵略者之妄念隨之；以爲不能取容於美國者，或可有得於蘇聯；非信蘇聯，或可挾蘇聯以更謀取容於美國。</p>
<p>吾人誠不知蘇聯心目之中，舉世列國、孰較中國更坦白誠摯，更願與蘇聯友好者？孰較中國史能相安相和以與蘇聯相處者？蘇聯援華之事實誠不可沒，然以近頃形成之黑影而論，客觀上亦有鼓勵侵略之後果者也；安得蘇聯當局秉數年來之對華同情，別以言行，使侵略者有所憬悟，庶幾遠東局勢及早澄淸乎？</p>

<p>滬東楊樹浦英商瑞鎔造船廠、規模頗鉅、戰後所僱工人、計長短工及臨時工包工等仍有四千餘名、最近廠方解僱服役多年之長工三十餘名、照勞資條例、工作滿五年以上者每一年給解僱金一月、而廠方祗允給每名原有工資四十天、致引起全體工友不滿、雖經要求至再、仍屬無效、不得已遂由該廠長工部份工友一千七百餘名、於前日起實行罷工、當推出代表四人、向廠方要求、（一）恢復解儸工友復工、（二）履行勞資條例解僱、不達目的、誓不復工、蓋廠方事實上營業網佳、且不斷添僱新工、僞「中華工人福益會」見有機可乘、派人向工人游說、願負責保障、誓必達到罷工目的、在未解決前、可發給各工人原有工資、誘使罷工工人登記、每名收取登記費一元、無知工人、迫於環境、前往登記者、截至二十三日止、已有八百餘名、昨晨該廠尙有短包工部份上工者、由罷工工人勸說時、與該處値差印捕誤會、發生衝突、結果印捕二名工人五六名各受輕傷、而工人代表被拘、經各罷工工人要求「福益會」設法、迄晚未得釋出、罷工風潮愈形僵持擴大、其動向頗堪注目、</p>
<p>工人說明　罷工情形</p>
<p>據該廠一部份工友我們瑞鎔造船廠近來因爲廠方通吿開除老工人三十二名、以致引起工人不滿、近因一小部份工人加入僞「中華工人福益會」、以致於日昨（二十二）上午六時左右上工時候、有身掛僞工會微章類似工人模樣之十餘人、把守工廠大門、不准工人入內工作、要求大家罷工、而引起衝突、廠方通知楡林路捕房派來巡捕多名、該十餘人即刻開始與西捕互毆、結果雙方各有受傷、不過我是該廠工人之一部、對此次廠方的措置、不大滿意、因爲將一生勞力完全出賣、替老板賺錢、結果所得的代價尙不足養活家庭、年老了、少許作得慢一些、你們老板就預備開除我們、不要我們了、</p>
<p>希望自力　爭取生存</p>
<p>當然我們應該爭取生存、不過求生存是要靠自己力量的、依靠僞工會是沒有用的、事實上能巷我們謀利益嗎、我們單看近來其他各廠罷工結果、工人給僞工會出賣了、希望我們瑞鎔的工友們、大家守住本位、眞正團結起來、爭取我們自己的生存、由我們自己的力量、來改善我們自己的生活、</p>

<p>— 遠</p>
<p>在一個明朗的早晨，衣袋中藏着隔晚拿來的去閘北的通行證。我由四川路橋堍的十七路無軌電車終點下來，心中忐一忑不寗地思索着，離別了二年餘的老家，它究竟到怎樣田地了！抱了懷舊的情緒，終於昂着頭踏上了征途。</p>
<p>跨過了橫臥蘇州河兩岸的橋，到了四川路的北端：在那裏，可以表現出黃道樂土的風氣，街上黃色制服荷着槍佩指揮刀的友邦軍人，占了行人的三份之一。我也不願意看那「親善」的面孔，垂着頭趕我的路。什麼株式會社，洋行料理所，……都在我眼角中迅速消逝。</p>
<p>虬江路映入我底眼簾時，僅一片片的荒土；不，頹牆瓦礫，還是雜亂地堆在地上。有許多工人，伏着背，在那裏幹淸掃的工作。旁邊還停着幾輛卡車，身上顯明地漆着「中華興業戰區淸掃班」字樣，車上滿載着剛由工人們採掘出來的鋼鐵磚瓦木料……等。</p>
<p>虬江路中段，有一個新建的長方石碑，碑上每邊都用斗大的字寫着不同的標語。電綫木桿和纔修好的房屋的壁上，也有同樣的標語。</p>
<p>由虬江路折入寳通路，這裏的空氣，倒比虬江路來得和平——看不見軍人的影子。××××租御用等字樣，在幾家修好沒有多久的屋簷下出現。二三十家窮苦同胞，過着那「樂土」的生活，門前養着五六隻羽毛長齊的鴨子，牠們倒優游自在地走來跑去。</p>
<p>老家漸漸地近了，心房的跳動，也隨着緊張起來。不一會，我兩年來日夜夢縈着的老家，巍然呈現在眼前。我迅速地用手帕揉着眼睛，但終沒有把目前的景像揉去。脚步不由地輕鬆起來，加速着向老家走去。</p>
<p>受過砲火洗禮的老家，和二年前的樣子大大地不同了：砲槍彈孔佈滿了整個牆壁，屋前的草地上有兩個很大的地窪，許是炸彈造成的吧。</p>
<p>我由那滿佈碎磚牆灰狼藉的樓下，走上樓去，那往昔供我們讀書寫字的檯椅書籍………，一切的一切，都不復呈現在我眼前了，祗在粉碎腐爛的破紙堆中，拾到幾張汚泥蓋面的照片，我呆呆地站着，憧憬着以往室內佈置的情景，而今滿目凄凉，成了廢墟。白雲蒼狗，安能無動乎中！</p>
<p>突然一隻羽毛不豐的白鴿，由窗前掠過，啊！這是我二年前豢養的白鴿，我欣喜異常地趕向窗前，翹首凝望，凝望着我心愛底白鴿。哦！一二三！……僅僅五隻。於是二年前的印象，又復一幕幕地映在我眼前。百多隻活潑玲瓏的雛雞。小鴨。和任看門的那只狼狗。淸雅可愛的熱帶魚·那小白兎·白燕等，現在已不復爲我所有了！我興奮的由樓下跑到園子裏，進行搜索工作，可是這些，終成了泡影而已。</p>
<p>園中被有刺的野草，喧賓奪主地將整個園田都佔去了。柳，桑，櫻花，杏樹，死的死，凋的凋，但父親手植的枇杷樹，却依然很茂盛地從荆棘中掙扎出來，而且，已有了未成熟的結晶品——蓓蕾了，我祝福它，希望它在惡劣的環境下——嚴寒的秋冬——開花結果。</p>
<p>草叢中，蟲聲唧唧，似訴似泣，好像報告什麼似的，我底心房跳動得益發利害。</p>
<p>太陽下的影子，漸瀨地縮短，無形中吿訴我時已近午了。我慢慢地拖着沉重的脚步，踏上了歸途，由寳通路走過寳源路，那裏發現了一塊被砲火轟斷了半壁的路碑，尙勉强豎立在路旁。行行復行行，走近校門，啊！校舍是經過砲火底洗禮，留存一半的殘壳，却還雄偉地挺起他那受創傷的身軀。俯視他的周圍，「他好像身經百戰的兵士，驕視着同儕，他是國家的柱石。」我低低地這樣想着。燦爛的校徽，還完整地留在校門的上面，校舍前的橫額上：「廣東初級中學」字樣，依稀尙隱的可見。一二八時，校舍與被燬後的情形又迴旋在我的腦際，砲火是只能毀壞學校的軀壳，它决不能毀滅他的精神，我期望着終有一天，他仍舊能繼續本來的神聖職責——孕育中國的公民。</p>
<p>嗚，嗚，鳴，火車隆隆隆地在校舍旁的鐵軌上走過，於是，我離開了母校底懷抱，懷着滿腔辛酸的情緒，催速着脚步走過了四川路橋，才舒出了一口氣。</p>

<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初仍因利物浦及孟買來電飛漲而上昇、後因南方帮在市套賣、及多頭獲利了結、市况因而轉疲、結果收盤價格、較之上日降落五六磅音、印度棉市繼續高漲不已、昨日連同預測又漲匕八羅比、埃及則亦漲五六十磅音、利物浦漲二十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來毫無進展、華廠停辦已有多日，同業亦殊爲靜寂、惟日方廠商近日仍有小額之零星交易、俱爲下級美棉、皆十二月份裝船者、茲將昨日棉市以美滙八元半折合送廠連稅價如下、</p>

<p>昨各帮來源、共到蘇嘉崑太楓靑等貨三十六七車、數近五千包、天雨連綿、在途次遭受水漬之貨、爲數頗夥、此種水漬貨、最易變化、不能擱置、故一般客販、爲免虧耗、急急求售、到源擁擠、市面已疲、囤戶在獲利後、均紛紛脫出、環境如此、賣買雙方心思均餒、早市開手、形勢即呈軟態、一般水漬貨甩低一元、及後本鄉店胃又復懈淡、各貨價在相互競售之下、節節步落、結果無論粳尖及陰變元等行情、悉再較前貶短一二元不一、計開常尖特粳三十五元、蘇崑白粳三十二三元、中次三十元二十九元、靑角薄稻特三十一元、普通者三十元左右、　嘉薄稻二十九元五角二十九元、蘆羊尖三十一二元、京尖三十一元二十九半、陳新變元三十三四元、陰元三十一二元、成交全市僅四五千包、回顧米市自連朝回跌後、目下特別貨行情與前高價相較已落五元左右、中關貨及客尖價已較跌七元左右矣、總之此次漲風、全係投機家操縱所激成、其脚地本浮、茲類局旣成、一時似難轉機、因內地各區自聞滬市暴漲後、兩地市面相合、已可獲利、搬運出境、絡繹於途、且訂購巨額洋米、亦將於最短期間絡續抵滬、屆時棧積旣豐、民食無優、此般投機家豈能再出魔手作祟、庶幾米價步步回低、納入正軌、而可額手稱慶也、</p>
<p>客秈昨日零星到頭、尙見蟬聯、而行囤與獲利大戶莫不急於求脫、綠連日國米到旺、洋米續定、人心已經虛軟、而昨日既有大批潮米貶脫外、又有洋米抵埠、形勢愈形軟弱、開市即見下趨、比之前市又小元外、高客秈祗三十一元半中次小至三十元左右，而進戶觀望、全日成交祇千餘包、</p>
<p>洋米定貨昨被粳秈續跌影響、新交易寂無所聞、惟糧商原擬在港搬運三萬包、巳由和生明生裝到、昨日已開第一批二千餘包、係一號圓長粒及二號米、一說係安南粳、洋米新到頗爲鋪作歡迎、前晚曾有原包一百九十八斤價四十元之議、昨巳降至三十八元、又一百六十斤組售開長粒三十三元、圓粒三十二元、二號三十一元云、</p>

<p>— 陸靑</p>
<p>昨天中西蒔花會在跑馬廳舉行秋季花會，冒雨趕去觀光，走到了第二重門內，就看見兩旁排列着好多盆很肥大的菊花，成了一條花的甬道，先到右首第一間大廳中，早就有一大幅美麗的圖畫，展開在我的面前。在右面靠壁的一帶，全是工部局所屬各公園中的菊花，佈置成爲一座菊花山。</p>
<p>在中央占地最廣的，是許多大大小小的大餐檀，都是西方女太太們所佈置的。上面有瓶花，有刀又，有盆碟……，有一桌用了種種燦爛的銀器，最是富麗堂皇，却僅僅得了第三獎；另外有很樸素的一桌，舖着淡綠色的桌衣，揷着淡綠色的蠟燭，中間放着一大堆的菜蔬，色彩很調和，佈置很簡單而自然，却得了第一獎。又在正中發見了一個紅木圓桌，上面是一檯中國筵席，瞧了那張彩色的獎憑上的西名，才知出品者是文化人周瘦鵑先生，中央放着一隻樹根雕成松鶴的高大花揷，上面刻有一首朱三友的詩，還有一首是乾隆時代松石山人的詩，這花揷中揷着許多倒垂的紅色鳳尾菊，斜側裏還有一隻靈芝高高的矗着，在那面還有一付銅鶴燭台，揷有兩枝紅燭，頗見莊嚴，四周陳列方形圓形小漆盤，用螺甸細嵌人物，自是精品，所有刻花的牙筷和磁胎的錫碗，綠地的五彩酒杯，全是乾嘉舊物。每一副杯筷左面，立着葉譽虎吳待秋樊少雲趙子雲等等名簽，每張都繪有梅花一株。這一桌古色古香，足爲國人張目。</p>
<p>在這中國式餐桌的前面，有三張大桌子，中間的一張，共有五件，有水石兩盆，都像畫中的山水，十分自然。後面一隻高花几上，供着一隻三脚大銅香爐，一塊大石筍旁種着一株鈎形大黃菊，作半懸崖形，也富有畫意。左旁桌子上，放着一架十景櫉，裏面放着小品盆栽和北風靈璧達摩像等的二十件，玲瓏小巧，光怪陸離，頂上放着半垂松一盆，松下坐着一尊達摩像，活像一幅古畫。櫥旁又有一株獅毛黃菊，配以英石靈芝，花朶位置得當，插有籬竹數枝，分明是東籬殘菊。右旁一桌上，又有短几一張，上置弔根小冬靑一盆，中供釋迦小銅像一尊。其前有一個漢磚的淺盆，佈置着一個虎刺的林子，紅千纍纍，鮮艷欲滴。在這三隻桌子旁邊，放着一隻碩大無朋的銀杯，大約是獎品吧。那時有幾位西方士女擠在桌前，正向着一位中裝大衣的中國人問長問短，在稱他Ｍr.　Chow，我於是從恍然中鑽出一個大悟來，原來這一位就是出品者周瘦鵑先生了我本來很想認識認識他，於是等那些西方士女們走開之後，靦顏地走上去自我介紹，又向他請敎一切，周先生很客氣的一一作答，並且說他春秋兩季參加比會，一則是爲了他十年來對於盆栽富有興趣之故，二則因爲西方人向來瞧不起中國人的園藝，所以想趁此掙回一些面子。這次居然拿到了全會的最高獎品—英國彼得葛雷爵士的大銀杯，像國際網球賽的台杯一樣，可以保持半年，到明年春季花會時交還會中，由會中將他的名字刻在上面，另給他一隻較小的銀杯，那就可以永久的保持下去了。記得周先生談話中，有一句警語，說：「但願全世界的人都成了花迷，那麽大家熙熙然如登春台，也許不致再有戰爭發生。」這句話很可玩味。我在這裏足足流連了一小時之久，才道謝而去。在外邊，又看到了孔志淸先生陳列的一桌，古氣盎然，和周先生的有異曲同工之妙</p>
<p>回來，這一夜我做了一個夢—花一般的夢。</p>
<h3 id="c95">小學生的訓導問題 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 落葉</p>
<p>自己當過幾年的小學敎員，然而對於自己八歲的小孩子的「上學問題」，却發生了猶疑。我因爲太熟悉這個大都會的小學校的「內情」了，因此，當今年這個秋季開學的時候，我又猶疑了：「是不是再送她進學校去讀書呢？」我很想自己來敎育她。然而，總因爲「家庭敎育」太單調，無論我對這個大都會的小學敎育抱着疑懼，但對學校敎育」因集體生活化適宜於小孩子的天性這一點，我總於又把我的女孩子送進一個略具規模的小學校裏去了。</p>
<p>在這不到兩個月中，這八歲的女孩子留給我有二個很深刻的印象，我覺得「小學生的訓導問題一是値得向全上海的小學校提出來一討論的。</p>
<p>第一個給我的印象是：記得有一天，我的孩子回家來吃午飯的時候，她不比往常有說有笑，快快樂樂了。她只是呆呆地，心頭上若干重大的心事。我很奇怪，就問她有什麼不快樂。她遲鈍地回答我道：「爸爸！今天我們一班裏，有一個同學被先生打手心，打了十幾下，哭得像放爆竹一樣響！爸爸，我真害怕，這個先生心裏不快樂的時候，常常打人的！」使這孩子到現在還呆呆地若有所憂的，原來那被打的小學生的哭得像「爆竹」一樣響的哭聲震懾著她的全心靈了。我萬分瞭解現在小學教員的痛苦情形，「心裏常常不快樂」，這是小學教員的苦悶，但是，往往以一己的喜怒哀樂而影響到小學生的本身是很大的，我在這裏希望「心裏常常不快樂」的小學教員們，請萬勿把「牢騷」發洩在無辜的天真的孩子們身上才好</p>
<p>第一人給我的印象是：有一天，當我的孩子回家來吃午飯吃好了後，她要求她的媽媽給她在小臉邊擦一些粉，最好還塗點胭脂。我聽了那話，真是吃驚不小。雖然，愛美之心，人皆有之。但是，我這小女孩子，還只八歲，有時候稍受一點凉，鼻涕還要掛出來，又何况，她的求美卻是這末「庸俗」要擦粉塗脂起來了？這真是使我百索而不解。問一問她，她說：「我們學校裏的先生，總是歡喜抹粉擦胭脂的女學生的，所以我也要這樣。」聽了這話，真使我又驚又憤，我真想把我的小女孩不送去讀書了，或者，寫一封信到該校云痛罵一頓。但是轉念一想：這樣的事情，或者很普遍，何不寫一篇文章，投諸報章，引起全上海的小學校來注意這種小學教員對自己行為的不檢點，因而影響了一靚小學生的純潔的心理，在這非常時期，小學校對「小學生的訓導問題」，應該來加以澈底的思考和怖置一下才對，這不但對我們的下一代，也對我們未來新國家的建立，都有莫大的幫助，我之寫這一篇文章，其用意亦就在這裏。</p>

<p>第十八回　談經濟繁榮與舊市　述婚姻掠奪溯遺風</p>
<p>這時吳君紫帮助了朱愛人，去安排好了她的汽車，因爲她從上海回來時，經過蘇州，仍舊開了她的車子回去。她們果然雇了一輛大型汽車，好在她們都沒有什麽行李，至多各帶有小皮篋一隻而已。所以她們這五個人，坐在汽車裏，還非常寬舒。邵慧華也和她們一同出了宿舍，看她們都上了汽車，她便也跨上了機器脚踏車，回眸向吳君素等一笑，說道：『火車站上等你們呀！」見她皮鞋尖略一用力，那機器脚踏車似輕烟一團，飛向前面去了。起初汽車追在後面，還瞧得見，後來一刻兒便不見了。因爲邵慧華這輛機器脚踏車，是美國最新型的，行時沒有什麼聲息。不比從前種機器脚踏車，那聲息是響得最厲害可怕的。及至她們的汽車到了火車站時，那邵慧華已經來了，而且把她的機器脚踏車，已經交給了管理行李車的人了。不過火車還沒有來，因爲這趟火車，却一是稱之爲遼滬通車。怎麽喚做遼滬通車呢？便是從遼寗一直開到上每來的火車，這可算中國自北至南的一條幹路。遼寗在從前，稱之爲奉天，因爲從前中國首都在北京，也有一趟車，開到北京，那條路便稱之爲北寗鐵路。到了後來，北京改稱爲北平，雖然平津之間的火車，依然往來頻繁。可是也有一次車，每日從關外開進到天津，從津浦路接着京滬路，直開到上海來的，就是這趟車了。吳君素看了看她自己的手錶，便道：「快了！還差五分鐘，我們到月台上去等吧。』原來現在中國火車開行的時間，很爲準確。說是幾點幾十幾分鐘到車站的，一定幾點幾十幾分鐘準時要到。因爲火車時間表，是好像一種制定的法律。遲到果然不許，早到也有所未便。有人說：遲到誠然是不好，旅客守定了時間，到車站上來。而車子呢？左等也不來，右等也不來，誤了鐘點，使旅客們守着時間要做的事，因此不能做了，豈非誤事？若是早到，豈不更好，我預先到車站，火車却已停在車站上了，那不是更好嗎？但是現在中國的鐵路，未必全是雙軌。有許多地方，有交車讓車等等，都有規定。不然，可不就要亂了。（二〇六）</p>

<p>— 新良</p>
<p>據美聯社十一日倫敦電傳，幽默大師蕭伯納最近會投函泰晤士報（Ｔimes）籲請速即開放倫敦各戲院云云，</p>
<p>目前，全英國三分之二的四千家影戲院雖然是重新開放了，但倫敦市中的大部上演舞台劇的戲院郤至今都尙未復業。英國勞工部長勃朗氏與伶人協會，音樂師聯會，藝術從業員聯會，國家劇院從業員社等各團體中所選出的代表，也曾聯合具文呈請過當局，請可能地儘速開放倫敦各戲院。</p>
<p>該文中切實地舉出了：除非倫敦及其他各大都市中的戲院統統都復業之後，成千成萬的依戲院爲生的人，會即刻遭到悲慘的失業的。</p>
<p>蕭氏在他的公開函中，也坦白地吿訴了我們：當上次歐戰時，在倫敦每一晚我們可有八千名士兵往戲院中去欣賞銀幕上的演出，當時的一般情况，眞是挺够熱烈的。但如今呢，我們的「士兵戲院』郤連一家都沒看見了。</p>
<p>『因此，當局者應當立刻在目前開放各戲館並且特地爲士兵們建造新的了。每個伶人及從事影業的人員，除非當他們有了更重大的職務時，是不應該讓他們停止工作的！』蕭氏在他的信里就如此地，懇切地希望着。</p>
<p>（筆者按：鑒於中國的士兵，在事實上的確不大有娛樂的享受，我想這種專爲士兵們設立的戲院，在目前的中國，也是迫切需要的。</p>

<p>Chongqing – General Bai Chongxi, who commands the front-line battles in Guangxi Province, issued a statement today from the battlefield headquarters, expressing confidence in the strength of the Chinese army to repel the Japanese military's offensive to invade Guangxi Province and urging the people to cooperate with the troops. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to Chinese sources here, the Japanese army on the Guangxi border has continued to advance towards Nanning, hoping to cut off the highway traffic between China and Vietnam. Since the Japanese cavalry arrived at Datang, south of Nanning, on November 19, the main force of the Japanese army has moved north along the highway. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, they have reached southern Guangxi. According to the latest Chinese military reports, fierce fighting is now taking place north of Datang. The vanguard of the Japanese army has reached Xiaodong. The Japanese army in the Xijiang area and the southern section of the Yuehan Railway is now launching an offensive against the Chinese positions to support the attack on Nanning. The Chinese army is currently attacking Fangcheng, and there is also fighting northeast of Qinzhou. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to sources here today, Japanese planes have been constantly bombing Nanning for the past three days, causing two major fires in the city, and hundreds of people have died as a result of the bombing. In these three days, the Japanese planes bombed the suburbs of Nanning from morning to night, without ceasing. Sometimes, as many as a dozen or so planes were used, and there were no fewer than eight or nine bombing raids each day. At the same time, because the air raid alarms have not stopped, it has been impossible to investigate the actual number of casualties. It is reported that the Chinese side has ordered all highways southeast of Nanning (including those from Nanning to the Annam border) to be destroyed as soon as possible. However, according to the British and American embassies here, although Japanese planes are bombing Nanning intensely, no news of foreign casualties there has reached here. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e10">The United States, the Soviet Union, and the Far East <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The restoration of order and the establishment of peace in the Far East depend on China and Japan; and the most helpful parties are the United States and the Soviet Union. The order and peace of the Far East were not in question, the problem lies in Japan's aggression; China resists the aggression, while the US and the Soviet Union have the power to encourage or curb the aggression.</p>
<p>The attitude of the United States is very clear, but its actions have been indecisive. Although it hates aggression, it has supplied Japan with a large amount of materials in the past two years, which in fact has encouraged the aggressor. In the most recent half-year, public opinion has gradually matured, and its attitude has changed from clear to firm. Without discussing other points, Deputy Secretary of State Welles has clearly expressed his views three times in the past week: (1) On the 17th of this month, he gave a speech to the press, denouncing the Japanese side's claim that the US government was preparing to recognize the new situation in China. (2) On the 21st, based on the Tianjin phenomenon, he clarified the US government's consistent policy of announcing the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. (3) On the 22nd, he refuted the Japanese dissemination of the atmosphere that the US and Japan had begun negotiations on a new treaty, stating that not only had negotiations not taken place in Washington and Tokyo, but also that the treaty would expire on January 26 next year and would not be renewed. In addition, the US preparations for various actions against Japan after January next year are also something that the US government and people are focusing on. The attitude of the United States is enough to clarify the international concept of right and wrong and make the aggressor realize the idea of deceiving the world. It will definitely help curb aggression and help the Far East restore order and establish peace.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, it has provided substantial assistance to China for two and a half years; however, due to the reflection of other international issues, even when people discuss international affairs and involve the Soviet Union, they often say that the Soviet Union's ideas and actions are the least predictable. This allows aggressive countries to continue their delusions, hoping that the Soviet Union will be threatened and induced to tolerate aggression, or even help them do evil.</p>
<p>Is it really because our judgment and knowledge are insufficient to say that the Soviet Union is the most unpredictable? Or is it because the Soviet Union's policy is too profound to be measured? Reviewing the past three months, who has ever foreseen what the Soviet Union has shown internationally? Who can predict the direction of what the Soviet Union will launch internationally from now on? Therefore, it is not wrong to say that it is unpredictable. Should a country's international policy be open and transparent, shared with the world, like the United States, or should it be mysterious and unpredictable, like the Soviet Union? Each has its own merits and demerits, and it is not appropriate to generalize. If the Soviet Union has ambitions for Poland and succeeds after the German offensive, this is indeed a harvest of unpredictable ideas and actions. If the Soviet Union had not issued a declaration of "striving to liberate the Belarusians and Ukrainians from the shackles of the Polish gentry," exposing the plot to communize the Belarusians and Ukrainians several years ago, would Poland not be a vassal of the German-Italian axis? Would it not be shouting for the Anti-Comintern Pact? In which direction would the German offensive have taken? What form would the European situation have taken? Although these are questions that will never be answered, there are countless similar questions; however, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union would not have been able to expand its territory by 200,000 square kilometers at the cost of 2.6 million Red Army casualties. Therefore, the unpredictability of Soviet policy is for the Soviet Union's plan to deal with Europe, and it can be said that it is adapting to the times and circumstances. The Far East is very different from Europe. The nature of the problem is different, the complexity of the content is different, and the impact on the future is also different. Moreover, given the Soviet Union's substantial assistance to China, it is not appropriate to regard the Soviet Union's policy towards the Far East as unpredictable. There are several reasons for this, which can be obstacles to seeing and hearing, and can be psychological demons, thus becoming a black shadow on the vision and psychology of the Far East problem. One reason is that the Soviet Union has taken from Poland, which gives people the impression of a fit of territorial ambition; the second is that the Soviet Union favors Germany and is dissatisfied with the United States, which inspires people to manipulate them; the third is that when the Soviet Union attacks capitalist countries, its language infringes on the United States, which shows people that there are gaps between the United States and the Soviet Union that can be followed; the fourth is that the signing of the truce agreement between Manchuria and Mongolia and the Soviet-Japanese proposal for a treaty make people suspect that all compromises are possible; the fifth is that the Soviet Union's actions in the past three months have made people believe that it is about to launch a major offensive in Europe, so it is plotting to blackmail the Far East. All of these things, although the Soviet Union's assistance to China is substantial, the black shadow it has given to the Far East in terms of vision and psychology has become stronger and more active recently. Where the black shadow lies, the aggressor's delusions follow; believing that those who cannot be tolerated by the United States may gain something from the Soviet Union; not believing in the Soviet Union, or using the Soviet Union to seek tolerance from the United States.</p>
<p>We really do not know in the Soviet Union's eyes, which country in the world is more frank and sincere to China, and more willing to be friendly with the Soviet Union? Which country is more historically able to live in peace and harmony with the Soviet Union? The fact that the Soviet Union has assisted China cannot be denied, but in terms of the black shadow formed recently, it also has the consequence of objectively encouraging aggression; how can the Soviet authorities, upholding their sympathy for China over the past few years, use words and deeds to make the aggressor realize something, so that the situation in the Far East can be clarified as soon as possible?</p>
<h3 id="e11">US Authorities Reiterate No Negotiations with Japan on Commerce Treaty, Focus of US-Japan Relations is Situation in Far East, British Newspaper Does Not Believe US Ambassador is Mediating the War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Washington – US Deputy Secretary of State Welles today warned Japan that the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which the US government has announced it will abolish, will expire on January 26 next year and will not be renewed, denying that new treaty negotiations are being held in Tokyo or Washington, and stating that US relations with Japan depend on the development of the situation in the Far East and its impact on US interests. Welles said, "The US Ambassador to Japan has often discussed relations between the US and Japan and various issues of mutual concern with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years, but new treaty negotiations have not been held in Tokyo or Washington recently, and the US government has not issued any special instructions to Ambassador Grew. The US government has repeatedly and clearly stated that these events are all related to the development of the situation, and the government will pay attention to every development and every fact that affects relations between the two countries, and carefully study all aspects of various issues." It is reported that Welles' statement is the second important declaration on US-Japan relations in a week and seems to have two meanings because its publication time is within 24 hours after Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horiuchi Kensuke announced Japan's "readiness" to negotiate a new treaty with the United States. Observers here are very interested in the propaganda of Japanese newspapers. Japanese newspapers recently reported that Japanese special envoy to China Kato will hold talks with the US Consul General in Shanghai, which are of the same nature as those held by Grew and Nomura in Tokyo, but in fact, not only have the Shanghai talks not been held, but even the date of the Grew-Nomura talks has not been determined. Officials here also commented on the Japanese claim that Kato met with US Ambassador to China Johnson in Shanghai for an hour and a half. Officials here claimed that Kato's visit to Johnson lasted only 20 minutes. In addition, Welles' statement is also an implicit indication of intensifying the movement to pass the Pittman bill on banning the export of military supplies to Japan when the US Congress convenes a regular meeting in China in January next year. Commerce experts here said that even if the US Congress does not pass the bill on banning the export of military supplies, the State Department can actually achieve the effect of a ban. After the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the government will have the freedom to adjust import and export taxes on Japan, which will greatly reduce or eliminate Japanese trade. The government had a precedent for Germany in the past two years, and the sharp increase in tariffs on German trade had brought US-German relations to a standstill before the outbreak of the European war. The US can implement the same policy towards Japan. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – At a time when the issue of a new treaty between the US and Japan is being discussed, the Department of Commerce recently released a report pointing out the impact of the European war on Japan's economic situation and proving that Japan's reliance on the United States for various raw materials and machines needed to continue the war against China or to maintain export volume is increasing. A concise excerpt from the report reads, "Since the outbreak of the European war, Japan's supply of various major raw materials needed for industry has been severely hampered, and those from the British Empire are particularly affected. 20% of the raw materials needed by Japan come from the British Empire. The tin needed for canned food comes from the Malay Archipelago. The raw materials needed for the rubber industry come from the Straits Settlements. Other raw materials such as wool produced in the Commonwealth of Australia and nickel and lead produced in Canada are banned from being shipped to Japan because they are exclusively for use by the UK. As for machinery and chemicals, which used to be supplied by Germany, the source has now been cut off. All of these factors have made it impossible for Japan's industry to develop, so it is impossible to expand sales to Latin America. In addition, Japan's financial situation is not good, and US industries require cash on delivery, which is the difficulty Japan faces when purchasing goods from the US." (Havas News Agency, 22nd) The Times of London diplomatic correspondent claimed today that people in general with good news sources were very skeptical about the news spread by the Japanese side that US Ambassador to China Johnson planned to propose that the US mediate the Sino-Japanese war. The US government is now dealing with treaty rights threatened by Japanese military action in a tough way, and it seems that it will never help the Japanese army out of its predicament in China. As for the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, both sides may temporarily stop the dispute due to their respective difficulties, but this truce agreement does not include a general compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan, but sacrifices the political interests of China and the Soviet Union in China. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi met with a Reuters reporter today and expressed doubt about the Japanese claim that US Ambassador to China Johnson planned to propose that the US mediate the Sino-Japanese war. It is said that the purpose of such news is only to confuse world public opinion. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Japanese Shionomi Seisaku Issues Statement in Guilin, Expressing Gratitude for Chinese Generosity <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Guilin – The campaign headquarters spokesman introduced Japanese Shionomi Seisaku when he received reporters this morning. Japanese anti-war writer Kashiji Wataru was also invited to attend. The spokesman said that Shionomi was from Nara Prefecture, Japan, and is 26 years old. He graduated from the French Department of Osaka Foreign Language School. He first served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was transferred to the position of secretary at the Consulate General in Hanoi in 1936. He was arrested at Zhennanguan on December 29 last year. At that time, Japanese newspapers fabricated all kinds of rumors, either saying that Shionomi was arrested in Annam by dozens of our troops, or saying that he was subjected to various abuses after being arrested, or even saying that he was executed by us for espionage. Now, however, Shionomi is still alive and well, and all the true circumstances can be explained by himself. The spokesman continued that Shionomi has now become our friend and an enemy of the Japanese warlords. He is moving towards the path of anti-war struggle for the Japanese people. Based on this fact, it is believed that there are two points that need to be explained: first, the target of our country's war of resistance is the Japanese warlords. The constant friendship between our people and the Japanese people is maintained, and there is no hatred at all. Second, the Japanese warlords harbor the dream of omnipotence with force, and do not hesitate to fight us with huge manpower and financial resources, which is contrary to the will of the general people in the country. We believe that most of the Japanese people have the same aspirations as Shionomi. At present, anti-war organizations among the Japanese people in the Communist country are growing day by day. Once the opportunity comes, they will surely rise up and overthrow the warlords and realize the true peace of East Asia and truly join hands with the Chinese people, and the time is not far away. Therefore, the introduction of Shionomi today is of great significance. Shionomi then stood up and, with a cheerful expression and excited tone, recited a statement as long as a thousand words, expressing sincere gratitude for the Chinese generosity. The statement described the reasons for his change of heart and his resolute participation in the revolutionary work of the Japanese people, pointing out the crisis of the current Japanese government and the contradictions of all the measures of the warlords. One section refuted the false propaganda of the Japanese side, admitting that his arrest was caused by mistakenly entering Chinese territory from the Liangshan area of ​​Annam. Another section announced his future aspirations to build a "peaceful Japan for the Japanese people." The statement also included a report on the Japanese warlords' ambition to advance south, saying, "To the best of my knowledge, the Japanese warlords are even preparing and exerting their strength to invade areas such as Annam, the Philippines, Siam, and the Dutch East Indies." After reading his statement, Shionomi made a concluding remark, saying, "As a prisoner of war under international law, I am treated as an international friend. I am sincerely grateful, and words cannot describe it." Then he showed a draft of his resignation, the translation of which is as follows: Respectfully submitted, since the end of last year, I have received the protection of the Chinese government in China. As stated in the statement I have issued, in order to build a genuine new order in East Asia, I have decided to sever relations with the Japanese government, which is a puppet of the military aggressors. I hereby submit my resignation. Please investigate. This presentation is made to Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo and Shionomi Seisaku, an official at the Japanese Consulate General in Hanoi, Annam. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Remnants of the Battle Around Sui and Zao <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Da Hong Shan – A reporter recently traveled along the route of the Japanese army's retreat during the Battle of Sui and Zao to reach this area. What was seen along the way was that most houses had been reduced to ruins. Even though several months had passed, the devastation was still evident. The organization of the populace is steadily improving, with the strengthening of the Baojia system, training of young men, and thorough implementation of fortified villages and clearing the fields. The production in the mountains is very rich. In addition to storing rice, the local authorities also export cotton, with a substantial yield. Recently, many residents have been spinning and weaving on their own. Along the route between Zao (Yang) and Huan (Tan), vendors transporting local cloth and yarn are constantly seen. Education in the mountains has not been interrupted either, and there is even a middle school. At sunrise and sunset, the sound of gunfire practice is mixed with magnificent anti-Japanese war songs, echoing through the valleys. Life here is safe, and prices are low. Being here makes one feel that the future of the war of resistance has unlimited brightness. Today, the reporter visited a certain army commander who has been steadfastly defending Da Hong Shan and repeatedly thwarting the Japanese offensives. He spoke freely about the operational process of his unit during the Battle of Sui and Zao and the current war situation. According to him, after the Japanese Ito and Etsuji divisions went north, his unit suddenly cut off the Japanese supply line in the Zhangjiaji area for as long as five days, causing the deeply entrenched Japanese army to run out of supplies and suffer a defeat. At that time, although the Japanese tried hard to break through, our officers and soldiers were determined to fight to the death for victory, firmly defending the key points, and never wavering in the face of Japanese threats. Someone at Tongzichong killed hundreds of Japanese soldiers, frightening the Japanese. Later, they pointed their division north and ambushed the southward-moving Japanese army in the northern part of Da Hong Shan. After five days and nights of hard fighting, they also inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army, seizing a large number of spoils of war. The corpses of the defeated Japanese were scattered everywhere, and they fled south in a panic, building fortifications to defend themselves. For several months, they have not dared to cross the Lei Pond even one step. This month, the Chinese army launched an offensive, and the Japanese army launched a counterattack for a time, engaging in fierce battles in the area of Daxiao Duoshan west of Maping and southeast of Suixian. After repeated assaults by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was still wounded and retreated. Now they are facing off with the Chinese army at Dushan west of Maping. Finally, the army commander told the reporter with a firm attitude that the officers and soldiers in the mountains are all determined to sacrifice themselves, their morale is extremely high, and they have close cooperation with the people. The Japanese army's combat effectiveness is weakening day by day, and their desire to be home sick is growing stronger day by day. Comparing the two, it is believed that the final victory must not be far away. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Weekly War Situation: 15th to 21st <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Commission stated that from November 15th to 21st, the Japanese army on various fronts had repeatedly engaged in provocative actions, with the most intense fighting taking place on the southern route in Guangdong Province. Since the Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the northern part of Hunan and Jiangxi last month, in order to cover up their military failures, they launched a landing offensive in the Qinzhou-Lianzhou area. Fierce battles are currently underway. The more important aspects of the fighting are described below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Province: Dozens of Japanese warships gathered in the sea off the Qinzhou-Lianzhou area on the southern route.

<h3 id="e17">Intense Air Battles on the Western Front; Many German Planes Shot Down; Two French Planes Also Lost; German Planes Attack British Military Port Again <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>

The range of air combat extended to a hundred miles. Observers witnessed all kinds of amazing and fierce battles. The French also lost two planes, while the British suffered no losses. According to reports from headquarters, a German Heinkel reconnaissance bomber in the northern region was shot down by a British Hurricane fighter and crashed on the Belgian border. Another German plane, the model of which is unknown, was also shot down by a British plane to the south.

Another enemy plane of the same type was also shot down by French anti-aircraft guns, and the plane was destroyed and the people were killed. The seventh German plane was also shot down by a French fighter in the Strasbourg area. The eighth German plane was a Dornier reconnaissance plane that crashed near Nancy.

<p>Brussels – A German plane crashed in western Flanders, Belgium, yesterday. The pilot parachuted out and landed unharmed, but the other three crew members were killed, and the plane was completely destroyed.

The plane then crashed, and the bodies of four German pilots were found inside, having apparently been killed by British and French pilots before the plane crashed. (22nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris – Shortly after midnight, air raid sirens sounded throughout northwestern France. People in Paris were also awakened by the sirens. Residents in the northern suburbs of Paris and in the city center heard artillery fire for ten minutes. The all-clear was given half an hour later. The number of enemy planes is unknown, but many people heard the buzzing of planes. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, six German bombers suddenly attacked warships in the harbor of Sheerness Island, dropping many bombs. At the time, a British plane was parked on the water and caught fire after being hit. The German planes were driven away by anti-aircraft guns. The British suffered no casualties. The German planes were first spotted in the sky over the site bombed nine days ago. Anti-aircraft guns immediately fired at them. It was noon, and hundreds of schoolchildren were leaving school to go home for lunch. After hearing the siren, some ran home, while others entered air raid shelters. Many of the bolder residents calmly looked up and watched. The seven crew members of the seaplane that was hit had jumped into the water when the bombs were dropped and were later rescued. The German planes also dropped bombs on a small inland ferry, but missed. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">British Secretary of War Reports Frontline Military Situation in the House of Commons; Long-Term Strategy Already Decided; Final Victory Within Reach <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>London – Secretary of War Hore-Belisha spoke in the House of Commons today, recounting the Polish war, which allowed the Allied forces on the Western Front to make arrangements in an unhurried manner. He said that Britain's cause was just, which enabled British nationals around the world to return to their country to join the army. Every week, thousands of British soldiers are sent to France, and the number will be even greater in the spring. Without the help of the British Home Guard, it would not be possible to complete the organization of the troops in France. The Home Guard's departure for France was earlier and more numerous than in 1914. Currently, one million people are receiving rigorous training in Britain. Although France was in financial straits, it still spent money and resources to create the Maginot Line. This kind of preparation is something that all free countries should be grateful for. Germany must defend a 200-mile border, while France must anticipate the possibility of Germany invading France along an 800-mile border from the North Sea to the Alps. The defensive positions currently held by the British army have been established in advance, so the British army's task is to strengthen and improve these defensive positions. All the areas where fighting is taking place are muddy. An unimaginably large-scale organization has now been established. In the early stages of the war, the British Expeditionary Force consumed 500 tons of gasoline per day. Vehicles must continue to be transported, and roads must be built. There is still a vehicle problem today, and even more will be needed in the future. The Secretary of War went on to say that the British army on the Western Front receives 270,000 letters and 17,000 parcels every day, twice as many as in 1918, and the British army has personnel to manage them with ease, which shows how large and complete the British army's various organizations are. He had just returned from observing the front, so he was able to report that the British army's discipline was good, its actions were lively, and it was exciting to see. The British army's sanitation is excellent, and the disease rate is lower than usual in the country. The British army now has all kinds of facilities for health. In addition to conscripting soldiers of all ranks, Britain has also recruited more than 85,000 volunteers. Soldiers in domestic divisions who can go to the front will be transferred out one after another when the Home Guard is established. This is a long-term war. The British people have always been known for their patience, so they can become stronger day by day. The prolongation of time does not affect Britain, but the enemy's economy cannot withstand it. If the enemy wants to win, they must break through the Allied line of defense. However, the Allies are now waiting for the enemy's fierce attack with confidence of victory, and the Allies can take advantage of the opportunity to move. The Allies have no divergent opinions and no inconsistent demands. Their strategy has been decided long ago, and the outcome is certain. The Secretary of War spoke about the success of Britain's management of contraband, saying that 14,000 tons of goods suspected of being transported to Germany have been intercepted. In the eleven weeks since the start of the war, a total of 441,000 tons of contraband have been seized. (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London – Parliament reconvened yesterday afternoon, and King George VI issued an edict, stating: "There is another war in Europe. Although My government has tried its best to maintain peace, Germany has finally violated its solemn commitments and invaded Poland for no reason. This is another act of aggression by that country and another act of bad faith. If My country does not want to lose its reputation and allow the freedom and progress of mankind to be endangered, it must respond to this provocative act. This is not to seek material gain, but to carry on the tradition of protecting freedom, rights, and free institutions. Now, Members of the House of Commons, all of you can accept the heavy financial burden and raise the necessary military expenditure. I am very grateful that the people are willing to make any sacrifice in order to achieve the final victory. This has also aroused deep impressions around the world. I am particularly excited that My subjects at home and abroad have been able to work together and participate in the war after the outbreak of war, and that the autonomous territories have also automatically joined the war and made extremely valuable contributions. I am also deeply convinced that the two allied countries, France and Poland, can cooperate faithfully with Us, and that the goals of the war can be achieved without doubt. May God bless your work."

He said that events in the Far East have a very important reaction in the West. He firmly believes that a new China will emerge from the destruction of the war, and the rebirth of the new China will be one of the greatest events in history. Europe seems to be facing political bankruptcy. Today's international society seems to be based on absurd theories.

<p>London – At a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Liberal MP Mander asked about the Shanghai issue. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Butler replied that the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement itself has not changed. The Hongkou area has not been returned to the management of the Municipal Council. As for the area outside the Shanghai Western District Settlement, the Shanghai Municipal Government, supported by the Japanese side, has disagreed with the Municipal Council on the issue of police powers on roads built beyond the settlement, causing considerable unease. The two sides are still negotiating in the hope of reaching a temporary solution. Mander then asked, "Under what circumstances does Japan allow British ships to anchor and unload cargo in various ports along the Chinese coast, especially in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai? The British shipping industry has previously complained about various delays and obstacles. Will this situation improve?" Undersecretary Butler then replied, "The facilities granted to third-country ships at Qingdao Wharf are still insufficient. In Yantai, pressure has been exerted on Chinese merchants not to ship their goods on British ships. However, according to reliable private sources, this situation has improved slightly. In Tianjin, British ships have been delayed due to the impact of the Japanese military's blockade and inspection. As for the ports in South China, Fuzhou has been blockaded by the Japanese military with underwater mines. As for Guangzhou and Shantou, which are occupied by the Japanese military, temporary measures have been established with the Japanese military authorities to allow British ships to operate on schedule."

<p>London: The mines that destroyed the Dutch liner *Simon Bolivar* and the Japanese liner *Terukuni Maru*, among over a dozen other merchant ships off the east coast of England, yesterday endangered British warships. The British 1,335-ton destroyer *Ipswich* became the first warship to strike a mine in that area. Fortunately, the captain was alert and quickly ran the ship aground, preventing it from being completely destroyed. Twenty-one crew members were injured, and forty are missing. Last night, over a hundred crew members disembarked at a port on the east coast on various vessels. One sailor told people that he was in the engine room when the explosion occurred and found himself in the water, not knowing how he got there. He had a minor forehead injury and was rescued by swimming. Nearby ships immediately rushed to rescue after hearing the explosion. Hundreds of onlookers on the shore watched the rescue operation under searchlights. The rescued were in high spirits and not discouraged, singing loudly as they came ashore, appearing quite excited. Because it was night, the rescued were dressed in various attire, some wearing bathrobes and others wearing sleeping clothes. It is said that the ship's hull was broken in two. It is noted that this ship rescued three pilots floating on the water in a rubber dinghy this morning and rescued ten shipwrecked crew members in the North Sea a few days ago. This ship joined the fleet in Devonport in 1936 and was equipped with four 4.7-inch guns. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The British cargo ship *Gerardus* sank in the eastern sea after leaving Hull. All twenty-six crew members have been rescued. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The Greek ship *Irina* (4,576 tons), carrying a batch of grain from La Palada, Argentina, to Antwerp, Belgium, sank in the southern British waters yesterday evening, possibly after hitting a mine. All twenty-three crew members escaped, with only three suffering minor injuries and being sent to the hospital for treatment. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>Helsinki: The Finnish cargo ship *Minerva*, carrying a batch of timber to The Hague, Netherlands, was recently intercepted by a German warship in the Baltic Sea and ordered to sail to a port in that country, where it was detained. There are as many as ten Finnish cargo ships detained by Germany, most of which were detained while sailing to neutral countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The *Social Democratic Newspaper* here recently reported that the mines laid by Germany on the east coast of England are apparently magnetic mines originally invented by the Swedish man Bestron in 1908. The manufacturing rights have been sold to many countries, including Germany and Sweden. Bestron told reporters yesterday, "The mines used by Germany are mostly made according to the principles I invented. They sink into the deep sea, and when a ship passes, they are attracted to the surface by magnetism and explode." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>London: Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigemitsu Aoi, summoned Naval Attaché Colonel Kondo, Lieutenant Commander Minamoto, and *Terukuni Maru* Captain Matsukura Bunjiro to the embassy on the morning of the 22nd to hear about the circumstances and causes of the sinking of the *Terukuni Maru* and to discuss the Japanese response. Colonel Kondo then visited the British Admiralty with Captain Matsukura for discussions. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: Matsukura, captain of the Japanese regular liner *Terukuni Maru*, weighing 11,930 tons, said about the disaster two days ago that the *Terukuni Maru* was definitely not sunk by a drifting mine. The ship was traveling at 15 knots on the southwest course of a sunken lightship when it struck the mine. The draft was 27 feet. It was daytime and the visibility was good. There were five lookouts on duty. The explosion was not on the side of the ship but under the bottom, causing the ship to jump up and everyone on board to be thrown into the air. The nearest British minefield was 35 miles away, and British mines, if they broke free and drifted, would automatically lose their effectiveness and would not harm shipping. Because it was daytime and the sea was calm, no one on the *Terukuni Maru* lost their lives. The ship did not list, and the lifeboats were lowered in time. Most of the passengers and crew were rescued by nearby ships. Before the *Terukuni Maru* encountered the accident, it was in the British contraband control port for less than five hours before it received its departure permit. Furthermore, according to British shipping industry sources, Germany is deliberately laying mines on the shipping lanes, with the obvious intention of causing losses and threats to commercial shipping, regardless of neutrality or humanity. Japanese and other neutral shipping companies are extremely indignant about this German action. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After the Japanese liner *Terukuni Maru* struck a mine and sank, the newspapers here are paying close attention and are requesting the government to issue notes to the belligerent countries, asking them to take measures to protect neutrality, while also acknowledging that this is an unavoidable fact.

<p>Bucharest: After the resignation of Romanian Minister of Economy Bujoiu, his vacancy has been concurrently filled by Prime Minister Armand Călinescu himself. Bujoiu's resignation came after the end of negotiations with the German trade delegation. It is said that Bujoiu deeply felt that some German trade methods and demands could not be integrated with Romania's current overseas trade system. He requested the government to adopt a new export and import system, but the government did not adopt it, so Bujoiu requested resignation. The German delegation, except for its leader, has now returned home. It is said that this visit yielded very little.

<p>Amsterdam: The Dutch official office issued a statement to Reuters today, explaining the Dutch government's attitude towards the British contraband control measures, stating that if the Netherlands can no longer supply Germany with the same amount of food and raw materials as before, then according to its neutral policy, it will have to restrict the supply of the same goods to Britain. It is unacceptable for belligerent countries to force neutral countries to declare that goods transported on their own ships cannot be transferred to other places in any form. Regardless of whether this is in line with the Dutch neutral policy, the consequences of acquiescing to this pressure must be considered. As a result of this pressure, the Netherlands will only be able to import goods for Dutch consumption and will not be able to trade with belligerent countries, especially Germany, which is the Netherlands' largest customer. British policy not only destroys the Dutch concept of neutrality but also destroys the basic concept of international law, and it will have the most unfavorable repercussions for Britain's own trade. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The Belgian Minister of Economy arrived in The Hague yesterday and held a long discussion with Dutch Minister of Economy Dr. Steiber to discuss the situation of the Central Kingdom tightening its blockade policy and implementing retaliatory measures against Germany. Officials expect that the Netherlands will recall the Dutch economic delegation currently in London and suspend economic negotiations to protest Britain's plan to obstruct neutral countries' commerce. Dutch newspapers report that the Netherlands will not recognize Britain's new plan because this plan violates international law. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: A Haitong reporter inquired with German officials last night about the British claim that Germany's strategy in naval warfare violated international law. It was said that since the beginning of the war, Britain has repeatedly abandoned international conventions and has also used international law for various propaganda purposes. Britain wants to give the world a bad impression of Germany, believing that Germany's war strategy is illegal. In fact, the purpose of German naval warfare is only to destroy enemy warships and ships used for combat, while the methods adopted by Britain have become even more extreme, such as "mine warfare." The Hague Convention of 1907 stipulated that after laying mines, a notice should be issued. Germany has notified the world of the areas where mines are densely laid. Britain should not cite the Hague Convention to prohibit the placement of mines outside enemy ports and along the coast to criticize. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to the Ministry of Economy, German-controlled commercial firms in neutral countries are now attempting to smuggle American goods into Germany by using neutral transportation companies. In September, American exports to Germany decreased by $12 million compared to September of last year, while American exports to Sweden, the Netherlands, and Norway increased by $11 million. The difference between the two numbers is almost negligible, and it is not a coincidence. The details of how Britain controls German exports are still confidential when it is established, but this control will not amount to a blockade but will only tighten contraband controls, aimed at preventing Germany from obtaining foreign exchange. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Regarding Britain's decision to blockade German trade, well-informed sources here recently said that Dutch Minister to the UK Stirum has issued a note to the Foreign Office, declaring the reservation of all rights. This note is not a formal protest document but only explains that the Dutch government, in view of the losses suffered in the future, has to raise some objections. On the other hand, the Belgian government usually waits until the British government announces the implementation of the blockade before initiating negotiations. Diplomatic circles here recently commented on the note submitted by the Dutch government, saying that this was expected. It would not be surprising even if the government formally protested. The British government will do everything possible to reduce the inconvenience to various countries, but it cannot change the original plan because only by blockading German export trade can it respond to the piracy methods adopted by that country.

<p>Berlin: The details of the German secret police's maintaining wireless communication with the British intelligence department were released here last night. It is reported that British intelligence personnel, claiming to be the German opposition, handed a wireless radio to the leader of the Stormtroopers. The German secret police then used Captain Stevens' code to maintain contact with the British government and the British intelligence department for as long as 21 days. This wireless message was exchanged with the British side in the name of the so-called German Revolutionary Party. Its future publication will prove the tragic psychology of the current British ruling class. The German secret police ended this contact at 10 PM on the 22nd of this month, sending a telegram stating, "Talking to arrogant and stupid people will inevitably make you feel tired. We will no longer talk. Greetings from the German opposition, German secret police sincerely." (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers yesterday published photos of the wireless radio handed over to the German secret police by British intelligence personnel. This wireless transmitter is installed in a small black wooden box, similar to an ordinary transmitter. After connecting the power and antenna, it can transmit messages. Because it is small in size and weighs only 12 kilograms, it is very convenient to carry. Judging from the structure of the machine, it can be manufactured in large quantities, and there must be many other places that use this transmitter. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>

I then contacted No. 2 and was received by his private secretary, and then discussed with Nos. 3 and 4. The results of the meeting were that France strictly abides by the treaty and does not want to conduct a 'trial' in the Saar region: (1) France is unwilling to take responsibility; (2) There will be major changes in Germany before the vote; (3) If there is a larger minority, the League of Nations will make a decision unfavorable to Germany. For the above reasons, a larger minority must be obtained through propaganda. I also discussed with No. 5 and No. 6. No. 6 and No. 2 and No. 4 all advocated using propaganda."

<p>Berlin: After two British intelligence personnel were arrested, officials here have not released any information, but it is generally believed that a report on the German secret police's maintaining contact with the British intelligence department will be released recently. The *People's Observer* reported that after the German secret police managed to maintain contact with the British intelligence department and interrogated the captured British intelligence personnel, they have now obtained important information. They found out that Best and Stevens were both responsible for important missions of the British intelligence department. The British government attempted to use The Hague as the wartime headquarters of the intelligence department and as a base for assassinations and other crimes. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The *Essen City National Daily* recently published details of the arrest of Georg Elser, the perpetrator of the Munich bombing. It is reported that "Since the Munich bombing, German border guards have paid close attention to the people coming and going. The search at the border between Germany and Switzerland is particularly strict. On the night of the 8th, customs officer Li Gan and his assistant Zippler were walking through the *Weissenburg Garden* near Constance when they caught a glimpse of a figure climbing over the bamboo fence of the garden, attempting to escape from German territory. Li Gan immediately chased after and apprehended him. The person claimed that he was planning to visit a friend named Focher-Herber and produced a border crossing passport, but the passport had expired in 1932. Li Gan lured the person to his friend's place, saying that he could definitely find out the whereabouts of Focher-Herber. The person refused, so Li Gan forcibly led him into the customs office and found various documents on his person. He was then taken to the police station. Under interrogation, it was learned that his name was Georg Elser. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: Otto Strasser, leader of the anti-National Socialist Black Front, who was pointed out by the German secret police as the mastermind behind the Munich bombing, recently told a reporter from *Paris Evening News* that he did not know Elser and that he was not a member of the Black Front. He had never heard of Best or Captain Stephens. It is noted that Elser is a worker. According to the German secret police, Elser has confessed to the attempted murder of Hitler. Best is the director of the British intelligence agency in Western Europe, and Stevens is an accomplice. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the circumstances of the arrest of the perpetrators of the bombing in Munich, Germany, the head of the National Political Police, Himmler, has submitted a report after arresting the so-called perpetrator Elser and the British spies Best and Stevens, strongly stating that the case was planned by the British spy agency. The general public here views this as a "detective novel" and is treating it with equanimity, but believes it is worthy of discussion. Military figures say that after studying this report, it will be known that it is completely inaccurate. According to Himmler, the National Political Police discovered and thwarted this conspiracy after arresting two British spies in Venlo, a town on the border of the Netherlands (near Germany). According to this, the German National Political Police already knew about the British spy agency's plot to harm Hitler in the capital of the Netherlands beforehand, but allowed the perpetrator Elser to lay bombs. Would they rather this conspiracy become a fait accompli? Or do they know that the situation is simpler? Best and Stevens have nothing to do with the British spy agency. Their place of arrest was not in Germany but in the Netherlands, or at least they must have been framed. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Rugao: The Japanese troops have been harassing Yancheng, Funing, and Gaobao recently and have suffered serious blows and casualties from the Chinese troops. Many of the Japanese troops stationed in the towns of Rugao have also been transferred to the front line, so the defense seems very weak. On the 6th of this month, the Chinese troops attacked Shizhuang, Xinsheng, Zhanghuang and other ports, and the fighting was quite fierce. In this battle, both sides suffered casualties. On the 15th, the Chinese troops planned to attack Xinsheng Port again. The Japanese troops in the port found out and released a motorboat carrying more than 20 Japanese and puppet troops to search the countryside near Liuwei Port (about 10 miles from Xinsheng Port). They found nothing and planned to return to the boat to return, but the tide fell, and the boat ran aground on the beach. The Japanese and puppet troops were unable to board the boat, so they ran back to report and sent a boat to tow it. The Chinese troops found out about this and immediately set fire to the boat and burned it. Later, another motorboat came, saw the situation, and was shocked. They set fire to more than 20 households in the areas of Liuwei Port and Doutianwei and killed more than 10 farmers, men, women, and children to vent their anger.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Senior Second Branch Court Criminal Division Chief Yu Hua Assassinated Yesterday Morning: Met Assailants Upon Leaving Residence, Shot Three Times and Died on the Spot <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:05, an assassination occurred within Lane 150, Route Tenant de la Tour, in the French Concession. The assassinated person was the current Chief of the Criminal Division of the Senior Second Branch Court, Yu Hua. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Intending to Board a Chartered Car, Suddenly Encountered Assailants</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:05, in Lane 150, across from the Pudong Bank office on Route Tenant de la Tour, a man in his fifties, wearing a gray silk-padded robe, was stepping into a chartered car outside the door of No. 202 to go out. Suddenly, three men lying in wait there drew guns and fired at him, firing a total of five shots. The man was hit by three bullets and fell to the ground. This injured man was none other than Yu Hua, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Senior Second Branch Court.</p>
<p>Hit by Three Bullets, Died from Severe Wounds</p>
<p>Seeing Yu fall to the ground, the three thugs fled towards the road. Yu's driver was stunned like a wooden chicken. When the nearby patrolmen arrived and saw the situation, they immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol cars to conduct a search. Yu was sent to Guangci Hospital, but the bullets had hit vital organs, so he died without being able to be saved. The bullets had struck him in the waist, chest, and heart, penetrating through to his back.</p>
<p>Lamented by the French Concession Legal Community, Grand Funeral Tomorrow</p>
<p>After Yu's death, the police transported the body to the autopsy room on Route Tenant de la Tour. At 3:00 PM, a prosecutor from the Special Second Court went to examine the body. Because it was confirmed that he had died from gunshot wounds sustained while alive, a coroner's report was completed, and the body was handed over to the family for the funeral. The bad news spread, and everyone in the legal community lamented his death. The body has now been moved to the Central Funeral Home on Route Mabileau, and a grand funeral is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Younger Brother Dafu, Renowned in the Literary World</p>
<p>Yu, courtesy name Manto, was from Fuyang, Zhejiang. He was 56 years old and had been in his current position in Shanghai for nearly ten years. He originally lived at No. 1 Rue Jules Pasteau but had just moved to No. 202 Route Tenant de la Tour at the end of last month. Yu deeply studied criminal law, and everyone praised him as a criminal law expert. Yu is survived by his wife, Biqin, two sons, and two daughters. The eldest son is already an adult, graduated from Tsinghua University, and recently went to the United States to study this spring. The second son is still a minor and is still studying. The eldest daughter is currently working in the mainland, and the youngest daughter is also studying. Yu formerly studied at Tokyo Hōdai University in Japan and served as a judge of the Supreme Court, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the third section chief of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. It is said that Yu Dafu, the current editor-in-chief of the Sin Chew Daily in Singapore, is Yu's younger brother. It is also known that Yu had recently taken a leave of absence at home and was going to court yesterday because his vacation was over when he was suddenly assassinated.</p>
<p>Served as an Official with Integrity, Always Upright and Impartial</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was known for his fairness in handling matters, not fearing the powerful, and not being tempted by bribes, so he was praised as a "clear sky." He was always upright and impartial in handling cases during his lifetime and had no personal enemies. It has not been heard that he had received any threatening letters. It is still difficult to predict whether this assassination was politically motivated. The police are currently doing their best to investigate the truth of the case and will bring the murderers to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Ruirong Shipyard Strike: The Turmoil Expands, There Appears to be Instigation Behind the Scenes, Hoping for Labor-Management Cooperation, Not to be Manipulated <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, owned by a British merchant, is quite large in scale. After the war, it still employed more than 4,000 workers, including long-term workers, short-term workers, and temporary contract workers. Recently, the factory dismissed more than 30 long-term workers who had served for many years. According to labor-management regulations, those who have worked for more than five years are to be given one month's dismissal pay for each year of service, but the factory only agreed to give each person 40 days of their original salary, which aroused dissatisfaction among all the workers. Although requests were made again and again, they were still ineffective. Therefore, more than 1,700 long-term workers in the factory went on strike the day before yesterday, and four representatives were elected to make demands to the factory: (1) Reinstate the dismissed workers; (2) Implement the labor-management regulations for dismissal; and vowed not to return to work until their goals were achieved. The factory's actual business is good, and it is constantly hiring new workers. The pseudo "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" saw an opportunity and sent people to lobby the workers, willing to be responsible for guaranteeing that the strike goals would be achieved. Before the issue is resolved, they will issue each worker their original salary, inducing the striking workers to register, charging each person a registration fee of one yuan. Uninformed workers, forced by circumstances, went to register, and as of the 23rd, there were already more than 800 people. Yesterday morning, when some short-term contract workers were working at the factory, the striking workers tried to persuade them not to work, which led to a misunderstanding with the Indian patrolmen on duty there, resulting in a conflict. As a result, two Indian patrolmen and five or six workers were slightly injured, and the workers' representatives were detained. The striking workers asked the "Welfare Association" to find a way to get them released, but they had not been released by the evening. The strike turmoil is becoming increasingly deadlocked and expanding, and its trends are quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Workers Explain the Strike Situation</p>
<p>According to some workers in the factory: "Our Ruirong Shipyard has recently announced the dismissal of 32 old workers, which has caused dissatisfaction among the workers. Recently, a small number of workers joined the pseudo 'Chinese Workers' Welfare Association,' so yesterday (the 22nd) at around 6:00 AM, when we were going to work, there were more than ten people wearing pseudo-union badges and looking like workers guarding the factory gate, not allowing workers to enter the factory to work, and demanding that everyone go on strike, which led to a conflict. The factory notified the Yulin Road police station to send many patrolmen, and the ten or so people immediately began to fight with the Western patrolmen, resulting in injuries on both sides. However, I am a worker at the factory, and I am not very satisfied with the factory's measures this time, because I have completely sold my life's labor to earn money for the boss, but the price I get is not enough to support my family. When I get old and work a little slower, your boss prepares to fire us and doesn't want us anymore."</p>
<p>Hoping to Rely on One's Own Strength to Fight for Survival</p>
<p>"Of course, we should fight for survival, but survival depends on our own strength. Relying on the pseudo-union is useless. Can they really seek benefits for us? We can see from the recent strike results in other factories that the workers were sold out by the pseudo-union. I hope our Ruirong workers will all stick to our posts, truly unite, fight for our own survival, and use our own strength to improve our own lives."</p>

<p>After the death of centenarian Ma Xiangbo, today is the day of the third seventh. For the sake of remembrance, Ma's relatives and friends in Shanghai and Catholic parishioners have scheduled a memorial mass for the third seventh day at 7:30 AM today at the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Held This Morning: Third Seventh Day Memorial Service</p>
<p>This memorial mass for Ma's third seventh day was initiated by Father Zhang Deluo, the principal of Xuhui High School, together with Ma's relatives and friends and Catholic parishioners. In order to invite people from all walks of life to participate in the memorial service, special invitation letters were distributed. The invitation letter was printed with Ma's portrait, with the inscription in seal script "May the Holy Lord Grant Him Eternal Peace and Illuminate Him with Eternal Light," and attached a notice saying, "Centenarian Ma Xiangbo returned to the Lord on November 4th, the 28th year of the Republic of China. November 24th, 1939, 7:30 AM, Third Seventh Day Memorial Mass and Ceremony at St. Joseph's Church, Yangjingbang."</p>
<p>Principal Celebrant and Acolytes Respectively Appointed</p>
<p>Today's memorial mass ceremony will be held in St. Joseph's Church, located inside the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession. Father Zhang Deluo, the principal of Xuhui High School, will serve as the principal celebrant, and Father Song and Father Jia of the Catholic Church will serve as acolytes. At that time, in addition to the Catholic parishioners in this city who will all go to participate, people from all walks of life can also freely join in, and one of Ma's nephews, Zhu Zhiyao's son, will be invited to play the piano. The ceremony will be solemn, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Rice Prices: May Plunge Sharply, Spot Supply Exceeds Demand, Fell Another Yuan Yesterday <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The rice market turned weak after rising. After the rice merchants' tea party market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, the spot market was flooded, and prices fell. Both the previous and subsequent market conditions fell by about one yuan and three or four cents. Yesterday, it was learned from the rice industry that the rice market can be considered stable in the future. In addition to trying to lower rice prices, rice industry groups are also doing their best to urge transportation. According to the previous demand for 10,000 bags of rice per day in Shanghai, the current demand is only 7,000 to 8,000 bags due to the obvious reduction in residents, and the residents have sufficient rice reserves, so the actual amount will definitely not reach this number. Therefore, the rice market in Shanghai is balanced between sales and supply, and the spot supply exceeds demand. The rice and grain inventory will increase day by day within half a month, and rice prices may plunge sharply at that time.</p>
<p>Executive Yuan's Circular</p>
<p>In order to regulate the people's food supply during wartime, the National Food Administration Committee, in addition to ordering the provinces to strictly control food transportation, has recently, due to the abundant rice production in various provinces this year, presented a request to the Executive Yuan for a circular to all provinces and cities to prevent unscrupulous merchants from manipulating and smuggling exports, stipulating that anyone who raises rice prices without permission or smuggles exports will be severely punished in accordance with military law.</p>
<p>Limiting Rice Prices</p>
<p>It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has ordered the provincial and municipal governments to set the highest rice price in rice-producing provinces and counties at no more than 20 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and the highest rice price in non-rice-producing areas at no more than 30 yuan per shi. Those who illegally smuggle exports will be punished by military law.</p>

<p>No. 93 Lutsze House, Bailinan Road, the over-the-border road in West Shanghai, was originally the site of the former Caonan Elementary School. On the morning of October 1st, it was occupied by the so-called "Shanghai Special Municipality West Shanghai Caogadu Self-Defense Corps." These people were supported by the Japanese and puppets and had full armaments. The pseudo leader's name was Hu Deshan, and the pseudo corps members numbered about a hundred people. After the pseudo-organization was established, it</p>
<p>Began Activities</p>
<p>Openly posted announcements saying that because the concession was unable to protect the residents of Caogadu, they were implementing "self-defense." Under the pretext of expanding the troops and purchasing "self-defense military equipment," they sent people every day to forcibly collect cash from nearby residents to provide funds for these people to squander. Those who violated this</p>
<p>Would Inevitably Be Arrested</p>
<p>And subjected to cruel torture. As a result, the general well-to-do residents were terrified, and many moved away to avoid trouble. When these people's schemes failed, they became even more intense, and under the pretext of searching for guerrillas, they broke into people's homes in the middle of the night, rummaging through boxes and cabinets. If no property was found, they would falsely accuse them of</p>
<p>Hiding Weapons</p>
<p>And tie up the original owner in the corps, torturing them to extract a confession, and only allow them to be redeemed after paying a considerable price. Residents who suffered from their poisoning numbered several a day. The various terrorist actions caused everyone who heard about them to turn pale. On the 10th of this month, 16 of these pseudo "corps members" were</p>
<p>Extorting Money</p>
<p>On Bailinan Road, when they were arrested by the British defense forces, although they were able to have all their weapons confiscated and released with the support of the Japanese and puppets, after ten days of detention, their arrogance was greatly reduced. Until the day before yesterday, this pseudo-organization surprisingly announced its dissolution.</p>

<p>After the Hankou Japanese airfield was bombed twice by the Chinese Air Force, the damaged planes were continuously transported to Shanghai. After more than a dozen planes were transported last time, at 9:00 AM yesterday, another Japanese transport ship, the Xindong Maru, transported a damaged plane from the Yangtze River. The head, propeller blades, and tail rudder were all bombed away, and the wings were also damaged. The ship was docked at the China Merchants Northern Wharf for unloading. In addition, there were four other damaged planes piled up at the wharf yesterday, which were also transported from Hankou. It is estimated that more than 20 damaged planes have been transported from Hankou to Shanghai, both before and after.</p>

<p>The Dalu Newspaper reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy told reporters yesterday (the 22nd) that the Shanghai management office of the Panama ship Polivar said on Tuesday that the ship had been released after being detained by the Japanese.

According to the phenomenon, the ship may belong to Nova Merchants, but the Chinese deputy who was detained a few weeks ago was released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Master Yuanying, the chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was arrested by the Japanese on the 19th of last month and was not officially out of danger until yesterday. At noon yesterday, he hosted a banquet at Yuanying Lecture Hall on Daxilu to thank the friends who rescued him. A reporter from Datong News Agency recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Arrested and Escorted to Nanjing</p>
<p>After Master Yuanying was taken away by the Japanese on the 19th of last month, he was immediately detained in the Japanese military unit in Hongkou on the same day. The next day, he was escorted to Nanjing and detained in the Nanjing Japanese Military Police Headquarters. He was interrogated once on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Interrogated Once</p>
<p>Only then did he learn that his arrest was caused by someone in Nanjing falsely accusing him of being an "anti-Japanese" element. As a result of the interrogation that day, the Japanese realized that the accusation was not true. Although he was still detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters from the 24th, he was treated more favorably.</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai on the 14th</p>
<p>Since then, the Japanese have used the excuse of investigation, and he has been detained for 27 days. He was finally escorted back to Shanghai by the Japanese on the 14th of this month. Although he left Hongkou immediately after arriving in Shanghai, because he had to go through the release procedures, he did not officially regain his freedom until yesterday (the 22nd). He spent one month and five days from his arrest to his escape. Except for the night of his arrest when he was detained in Hongkou, the rest of the time was spent in Nanjing, and he was not involved in Jiangwan at all.</p>
<p>Future Conduct</p>
<p>After Master Yuanying officially escaped danger yesterday, he revisited Yuanying Lecture Hall on Daxilu at 10:00 AM. For a time, monks and laity and devotees gathered to inquire. Then, at 12:00 noon, he set up a vegetarian banquet to thank the friends who had been running around to rescue him. During the banquet, he said that he would soon leave Shanghai for the South Seas to continue to preach Buddhism.</p>

<p>The fifty-cent stamps issued by the Shanghai Postal Administration were once interrupted, resulting in the postal office replacing them with two twenty-five-cent stamps for postage to foreign countries, which was very inconvenient for senders. Recently, the postal office has doubled the postage to foreign countries, and the need for fifty-cent stamps is even more urgent. In view of this, the postal office has re-printed a large number from the United Kingdom and has decided to start selling them simultaneously at the main office on North Sichuan Road and various postal branches from today.</p>

The dredging work will be carried out with Japanese assistance. When the dredging is completed, it will slightly prevent the flooding of roads in the city.</p>

<p>US Ambassador to China Johnson, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for the north today on the Kailuan Coal Mine Company's Kaiping ship, temporarily changed his plan and purchased a ticket for the Aoc Shipping Company's Serpentine Hutchinson on the 22nd. However, because American merchants in this city pleaded for him to leave Shanghai after participating in Thanksgiving, he changed his plan again and still took the Kaiping ship north. A reporter from Dachung News Agency learned last night that the Kaiping ship left the Kaiping Bureau Wharf in Pudong at 4:00 AM this morning and is expected to arrive in Qinhuangdao on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>It is Rumored That Kato Will Also Go to Beiping</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the rumor this morning (the 23rd) that US Ambassador to China Johnson left Shanghai last night (the 22nd) is not accurate. In fact, Ambassador Johnson will travel north on the Kailuan Coal Mine Company's Kaiping (transliteration) ship tonight. It is reported that Ambassador Johnson met with Japanese special envoy Kato yesterday morning to discuss various issues related to China. Ambassador Johnson is going to Beiping this time to reunite with his family, and Kato will also go to Beiping, where they may continue to talk.</p>

<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that Mitsui &amp; Co. has successively seized more than 5,000 baskets of eggs from two American companies and five British companies since October 10. Because the newspapers revealed this, the public was indignant, and the Japanese authorities reacted. Mitsui &amp; Co. began to gradually return the seized eggs to their original owners. In the past two or three days, hundreds of baskets of eggs have been returned, but Mitsui &amp; Co. is still extorting money for the new eggs purchased by these foreign companies and transported to this city. In addition to charging a purchase permit fee of 2 yuan per basket of fresh eggs, it also charges a handling fee of 50 cents. Although third-country companies object, they have to pay this extortionate fee, otherwise they cannot obtain fresh eggs. Foreign companies are trying to eliminate this illegal extortion, as it contradicts the open-door policy that the Japanese claim to abide by. Egg merchants must be satisfied until all the seized eggs are compensated and the illegal extortion is abolished.</p>

<p>The Dalu Newspaper reported that an official of the British-owned Luen Shing Company said yesterday (the 22nd) that the workers' strike in the company's Pudong factory had lasted for nearly half a year, and that only a part of those who stopped the strike on Friday of last week had returned to work in the factory, but it is unlikely that all work will resume at present, as the necessary repairs to the machines are still in progress. The factory and the striking workers reached a resolution last week, but the details are not yet known for sure. However, according to unofficial sources, the end of the dispute did not bring significant benefits to the workers.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Returning from Zhabei <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>In a bright morning, I had the pass to Zhabei that I had obtained the night before in my pocket. I got off at the terminus of the No. 17 trolleybus at the Sichuan Road Bridge, and I wondered uneasily in my heart what my old home, which I had left for more than two years, had become! With a nostalgic mood, I finally raised my head and embarked on the journey.</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge that lies across both sides of the Suzhou River, I arrived at the northern end of Sichuan Road: there, the atmosphere of a yellow utopia could be seen. Soldiers of the Allied forces in yellow uniforms, carrying guns and wearing command knives, accounted for one-third of the pedestrians. I didn't want to look at that "friendly" face either, and I hurried on my way with my head down. What joint-stock companies, foreign firms, restaurants... all disappeared quickly in the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>When Qiujiang Road came into my sight, it was just patches of barren land; no, dilapidated walls and rubble were still piled messily on the ground. There were many workers, with their backs bent, doing cleaning work there. There were also several trucks parked next to them, clearly painted with the words "China Reconstruction War Zone Cleaning Team" on them. The trucks were full of steel, bricks, tiles, wood, etc., that had just been excavated by the workers.</p>
<p>In the middle section of Qiujiang Road, there was a newly built rectangular stone tablet, with slogans written in large characters on each side of the tablet. The same slogans were also found on the electric wire poles and on the walls of the newly repaired houses.</p>
<p>Turning from Qiujiang Road into Baotong Road, the air here was more peaceful than on Qiujiang Road - no soldiers could be seen. The words ×××× rented for imperial use appeared under the eaves of several houses that had been repaired not long ago. Twenty or thirty poor compatriots were living that "utopian" life, raising five or six fully feathered ducks in front of their doors, which walked around leisurely.</p>
<p>My old home was getting closer and closer, and my heart was beating faster and faster. After a while, my old home, which I had dreamed of day and night for two years, stood巍然 before my eyes. I quickly rubbed my eyes with my handkerchief, but I still couldn't rub away the current scene. My footsteps couldn't help but lighten up, and I accelerated towards my old home.</p>
<p>My old home, which had been baptized by artillery fire, was very different from what it had been two years ago: bullet holes covered the entire wall, and there were two large depressions in the lawn in front of the house, perhaps caused by bombs.</p>
<p>I walked up the stairs from the bottom floor, which was full of broken bricks, wall ashes, and mess. The tables, chairs, books, etc., that we used to read and write on... everything was no longer present in front of me. I only picked up a few photos covered with mud from the shattered and rotten piles of broken paper. I stood there blankly, looking back at the scene of the previous interior decoration. Now, it was a desolate scene, a ruin. White clouds and grey dogs, how can one not be moved by it!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a white pigeon with undeveloped feathers flew past the window. Ah! This was the white pigeon I had raised two years ago. I rushed to the window in great joy, looking up and staring, staring at my beloved white pigeon. Oh! One two three!... Only five. Then, the impressions of two years ago were reflected in my eyes one scene after another. More than a hundred lively and exquisite chicks. Ducklings. And the wolf dog that guarded the door. Clear and lovely tropical fish. That little white rabbit. White swallows, etc., were no longer mine! I excitedly ran downstairs to the garden to search, but these eventually became a dream.</p>
<p>In the garden, thorny weeds had usurped the place and occupied the entire garden. Willows, mulberries, cherry blossoms, and apricot trees, the dead were dead, and the withered were withered, but the loquat tree planted by my father still struggled out of the thorns very luxuriantly, and it already had immature crystal products—buds. I blessed it, hoping that it would bloom and bear fruit in the harsh environment—the cold autumn and winter.</p>
<p>In the grass, the sound of insects chirped, like a complaint, as if reporting something. My heart was beating even more violently.</p>
<p>The shadow under the sun gradually shortened, silently telling me that it was almost noon. I slowly dragged my heavy footsteps and embarked on the return journey. Walking along Baotong Road through Baoyuan Road, I found a road sign that had been bombed in half, still standing barely on the side of the road. Walking, walking, and walking again, I approached the school gate. Ah! The school building had been baptized by artillery fire, leaving half of its shell, but it still stood雄偉 with its wounded body. Looking down at its surroundings, "It is like a soldier who has gone through hundreds of battles, looking down on his peers. It is the pillar of the country." I thought quietly. The bright school badge was still completely left on the top of the school gate. The words "Guangdong Junior High School" on the horizontal plaque in front of the school building were still faintly visible. The situation of the school building after being destroyed during the January 28th Incident swirled in my mind again. Artillery fire can only destroy the shell of the school, it can never destroy its spirit. I hope that one day, it will still be able to continue its original sacred duty—nurturing Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>Woo, woo, woo, the train rumbled past on the tracks next to the school building. Then, I left the embrace of my alma mater, and with a full of sadness, I speeded up my footsteps and walked over the Sichuan Road Bridge before I could breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Since Sichuan Province became the wartime capital after the establishment of the National Government's wartime headquarters, it has become the central point for military and political resistance. Japanese aircraft frequently scout and seize opportunities to launch air raids, making relief efforts crucial. Through gradual improvements, these efforts have become well-established. According to a letter from Chongqing, several dozen doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Joint First and Second Teams have already arrived in Chongqing. A volunteer treatment team from Jiangsu Medical College is also in Chongqing assisting with relief work. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Various Counties in Sichuan</p>
<p>Faced with the constant threat of air raids, local authorities place great importance on local relief efforts. Mr. Tang Chengzong, director of the Chongqing office of the Chinese Red Cross Society, recognizing this, has now</p>
<p>Drafted a Plan</p>
<p>and submitted it to the headquarters for approval. The plan aims to strengthen the relief capabilities of the existing Red Cross Society branch offices in various counties of Sichuan Province. Mr. Tang will soon, along with senior medical personnel dispatched by the relief headquarters of the society, depart for an inspection. They will first</p>
<p>Improve Organization</p>
<p>and then, based on actual needs, provide appropriate subsidies of medicine or funds. In addition, they are actively preparing to establish branch offices in the counties along the rivers and highways of Sichuan Province that do not yet have them and have already telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to order the counties to begin preparations. Furthermore, several dozen doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Joint First and Second Teams</p>
<p>Have Already Arrived in Chongqing</p>
<p>The First Team is responsible for medical work at the Red Cross Chongqing Hospital, while the Second Team is responsible for mobile treatment, providing services in the evacuation zones of Chongqing City during peacetime. When an outside county is affected by disaster, they will immediately travel to the disaster area in ambulances to provide relief. In addition, at the request of the Red Cross, Jiangsu Medical College has organized, with professors and students, a</p>

<h3 id="e57">Rickshaw Company Owners Exploit Rickshaw Pullers with Fines and Violate Regulations by Increasing Rickshaw Rental Fees: Twelve Companies Fined <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>In order to protect rickshaw pullers, the Public Concession’s Municipal Council issued an order in January 1937 to all rickshaw owners stating that the full-day (24-hour) rental fee should not exceed 77 cents in legal tender; otherwise, they would be subject to severe penalties. However, most rickshaw owners,</p>
<p>Exploiting Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>cared only about lining their own pockets and generally disobeyed the Municipal Council's orders. They usually increased the rental fee to 94 cents, an increase of 17 cents over the Municipal Council's regulation. If a rickshaw owner owned 200 rickshaws, they could increase their income by an additional $1,020 per month. This situation was discovered by the Municipal Council's Transportation Office, which began an investigation and found that</p>
<p>Violators of the Regulations Currently Include: Lu Zhenhuang, No. 366 Shanhai Pass Road; Sanmin Company, No. 345 Changping Road; Rixin Company, No. 527 Haifang Road; China Anbu Company; Wang Yuant'i, No. 194 North Xizang Road; Lu Huangshi, No. 588 Maigen Road; and Yin Youlan, No. 5, Lane 324, No. 324 Haifang Road and twelve others. Accordingly, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council's Legal Department, filed a lawsuit against these twelve companies with the Special First Court's Prohibition Tribunal in accordance with Article 34 of the Municipal Council's Transportation Regulations, which states that "those who violate the regulations by</p>
<p>Overcharging Rickshaw Rental Fees</p>
<p>shall be fined 100 yuan for the first offense, and 25 yuan for every 24 hours thereafter." Yesterday morning, Judge Sheng opened the court to summon the defendants. The police lawyer Zhang argued that the rickshaw owners relied on the income from rickshaw rentals for their livelihood and were already able to live comfortably, yet they still ruthlessly exploited the impoverished rickshaw pullers. Therefore, they should be severely punished; otherwise, it would not be enough</p>
<p>To Serve as a Warning.</p>
<p>However, due to the limitations of the regulations, he requested that the court impose the maximum fine allowed by the regulations so that the rickshaw pullers could be protected. After questioning by Judge Sheng, the twelve defendant rickshaw owners were each fined 100 yuan as a warning. It is reported that this is the first time such an incident has occurred.</p>

<p>Wei Feigen (age 26), a native of Pudong, was an employee at the No. 7 Refugee Camp on Peng Road. In March of last year, Song Yunnan (age 20), a woman from Yinxiang Township who lived in the Shenxin No. 7 Factory workers' quarters on Binlang Road, often visited her aunt at the refugee camp. She was seduced by Wei, who later took her to a hotel room and raped her, and they met secretly from time to time. Recently, Wei Feigen became addicted to gambling and the salary he earned at the camp was not enough for his extravagance. Therefore, he had malicious intentions and earlier this month, sold Song to Wang A'gen, a fellow villager living at No. 10 Kaifeng Road, as his wife for the price of 40 yuan. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, Wang A'gen held a wedding feast at the Hongyunlou Restaurant at No. 236 Arlabasdr Road. Song, being a simple village woman, had no choice but to obey Wei's arrangements, not daring to oppose him for fear of his brutality. Unexpectedly, Song's father, Song Xiansheng, arrived in Shanghai from the countryside the day before yesterday, learned of the situation, and reported it to the French police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Wei and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was brought before the Special First Court, where Judge Liu Yugui interrogated him, and based on his clear confession, ordered him to be returned to custody to await sentencing at a later date.</p>

<p>Wang Yilin, a young man from Ningbo, age 22, living at No. 12, Lane 142, Zhao Zhujiao Road, currently works as a clerk at the Xiangxing Foreign Firm with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. He has been living with Zhang Jianying, a woman from Shaoxing, age 25, for four years and they have a daughter, age three. However, Wang, hindered by his grandmother's disapproval of his cohabitation with Zhang, married Zhang Meiqing, a woman from his hometown, age 22, through a matchmaker last year. Unexpectedly, Wang and Zhang did not get along. Since their marriage, they have never shared a bed and are as incompatible as ice and charcoal. Wang left Zhang alone at No. 149 Chongqing Road, neglecting her. Wang's parents also did not approve of Wang's cohabitation with Zhang and tried to persuade Wang to separate from Zhang, but Wang stubbornly refused. His father deeply resented Wang's unfilial conduct and published a notice severing their father-son relationship. Wang continued to live with Zhang as before. Recently, Zhang learned of Wang's residence and reported it to the French police station the day before yesterday. The police dispatched detectives to catch them in the act and arrested both Wang and Zhang. That afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, where the police lawyer prosecuted them for adultery and disrupting the family. After questioning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, it was decided to postpone the hearing until the 29th to summon Wang Yilin's parents to appear in court for further questioning.</p>

<p>At 7:00 PM on the 21st, the Yuhe Restaurant opened by Chu Shougen at No. 291 Shanxi Road was suddenly stormed by dozens of people wielding knives and sticks, who not only smashed all the objects inside but also stabbed and killed Lu Tinghe (age 37), a Wuxi native who worked at the restaurant, and injured Wei Renbao, Wang Yuquan, and Qian Qiaolin before fleeing. Subsequently, Chief Detective Wang Xingsheng and Detective Jin Deshun of the General Patrol Bureau discovered that the perpetrators were Xu Shujin, a Siyang native who owns a flatbread shop at No. 288 Shanxi Road, and his associates Sun Changbiao, Zhang Maotong, and Dong Changyou. The incident stemmed from a dispute on the 19th when Xu and others had dinner at the Yuhe Restaurant and consumed food and drinks worth about $1.56 but only paid one dollar. The restaurant asked for the remainder, leading to the feud and this unfortunate incident. The detectives arrested Xu and the other three men and brought them before the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances, stating that the case still required investigation and requested permission to detain the suspects for one week pending further investigation and prosecution. After questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzi, Xu Shujin and the other three men were ordered to be remanded in custody and the hearing was postponed.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Ms. Xu Liangzhen, who states that she read a news item in the local news section of the Shenbao on the 22nd of this month entitled "Disagreement Between Unmarried Couple on Wedding". After investigating, we found that the news item was inconsistent with the facts. The engagement between Ms. Xu and Mr. Pu was arranged by their parents when they were young. Ms. Xu believes that marriage is a lifelong commitment to happiness and has long expressed her opposition to this illegal marriage. At that time, it was still before the war, and she had not yet come of age, so she did not actively advocate for it. The report stated that the wedding was wavering due to the destruction of Mr. Pu's property, which wrongly implies that Ms. Xu's motivation for denying the wedding was based on money, which is inaccurate. The reported amount of engagement gifts and jewelry is even more untrue. We especially ask your esteemed newspaper to instruct your lawyer to send a letter on our behalf to correct the report. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, Sun Zuji, Lawyer, Local News Section, Shenbao, November 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Was Quite Tense in the Early Morning; Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger and Japanese Banks Frequently Absorbed Forward Contracts; Market Situation Was Relatively Stable in the Afternoon <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: HSBC's listed rates did not fluctuate. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates continued to tighten. The pre-day's storm had already revealed clues, finally erupting at the opening in the morning. Although the momentum did not seem to over-expand, and general merchants took advantage of the high prices to sell, the exchange market had broken away from the state of fluctuation and entered a competitive arena. The subsequent market reversed and became stagnant, so the result was still relatively stable. At the opening, British and American exchange rates sharply contracted by a huge 5.25 points, leading to a sharp tightening of both the British and American exchange rates in the early morning, calculated as 5 pence and 25 points and 8 and a half yuan respectively. Subsequently, Huajian and Sassoon and other companies also started to compete, and the strong benefit of recent strong ingestion was still not satisfied, and they continued to absorb strongly. For a time, the market situation was chaotic. At that time, most operators did not know what to do with buying and selling. The trend of softness has been difficult to reverse. At one point, the British currency tightened to 5 pence and 18.75 points, and the American exchange rate also reported 8 yuan and 375 points. Subsequently, the cotton yarn gang decided to take advantage of the high prices to sell forward contracts, and the banks that absorbed them also hovered without moving forward, and then saw it return to stability, to 5 pence and 25 points and 8 and a half yuan. The price was exactly the same as the morning opening. By noon, the transaction suddenly thinned, and the situation stabilized. Until the afternoon, it was still stagnant and unchanged. Only the Japanese banks and North China frequently absorbed forward contracts, but the speculators vomited them, which was enough to offset each other, and the trend was slightly softer. By the close, the British gold was 5 pence and 12875 points, and the American exchange rate was 8 yuan and 4375 points, which was British tighter by .03125 and American softer by .15625 compared to the previous day. As for the futures market situation, it was originally the same as the spot market, and there were also transactions.</p>
<p>Yarn and Flower Gang Took Advantage of the High Prices to Sell</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was almost flat at .0625, the New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold was stagnant, the exchange rate between Britain and the United States and France was flat, the exchange rate to Shanghai contracted by .0625, the exchange rate from the United States to Britain fell sharply by 5.25 points, the exchange rate to Shanghai decreased by 5 points, and the exchange rate to France decreased by 1.875 points. The Central Bank's listed rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 5 pence and 25 points for British gold and 8 and a half yuan for American exchange, which was flat for British and tighter by .09375 for American compared to the previous closing. Because of the sharp drop in exchange rates, the banks that absorbed were quite nervous. Chinese merchants first settled into a bank's December American exchange rate of 10,000 yuan, which was 8 yuan and 4375 points. Then, Sassoon and other foreign banks also competed to absorb a certain bank's spot British gold at 5 pence and 25 and 21875 points and spot American exchange at 8 yuan and 4375 and 375 points. Therefore, the process was quite soft. When HSBC's listed rates were announced to be unchanged and the balance tax on silver was announced to be neither increased nor decreased, the tightest British gold once called over 5 pence and 1875 points. Subsequently, the cotton yarn gang suddenly took advantage of the high prices to sell forward contracts, and at the same time, Hong Kong also sent a telegram to sell out, so the potential stopped tightening and turned hard. It is estimated that the cotton yarn gang sold to a certain bank's December American exchange rate of 8 yuan and 375 and 4375 points. Later, the Hong Kong telegram sold the spot British gold at 5 pence and 234375 and 25 points to Huabi Datong. At the same time, the spot American exchange also returned to hard to 8 and a half yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon. By noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 5 pence and 234375 points for British gold and 8 yuan and 46875 points for American exchange, which was 15625 points tighter for British and continued to be .03125 softer for American compared to the morning opening. It was heard that it was slightly softer after closing, with British gold estimated at 5 pence and 21875 points and American exchange at 8 yuan and 4375 points.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Were Both Tightened</p>
<p>The state of the after-market suddenly turned quiet. There were few spot British and American exchange transactions, so the price was also very stagnant. It was only heard that Japanese banks and Huabi absorbed Chinese and foreign banks' December American exchange rate of 8 yuan and 34375 and 375 points.

<h3 id="e70">Though Securities Dealers Tried Hard to Sell, the Gold Market Still Soared; Exchange Rates Tightened Again... Operators All Looked Towards Prosperity, Trading Brisk in the Morning, Quiet in the Afternoon... Peak at 3755 Yuan <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was bullish, continuing its prosperous trend. With the exchange market trending towards tightening, operators were all talking about rising gold prices. A certain money exchange firm continued to buy aggressively after its purchases the day before, accumulating a considerable amount. However, in keeping with the usual practices of securities dealers, they also sold heavily. Furthermore, many general retail bulls continued to emerge, making it difficult for the gold price to rise significantly. As a result, it only increased by a little over twenty yuan. Early in the morning, there were reports of the exchange market softening, further strengthening the psychology of prosperity, and so the market opened at 3730 yuan, up twenty-six yuan. Subsequently, buyers surged in like a tide, with a certain money exchange firm buying fervently, pushing the price up to a peak of 3755 yuan. Afterwards, although the buying intention of the money exchange firm remained strong, the securities dealers were selling aggressively, so the position was relatively balanced for a time, fluctuating around 3735 yuan. Later, the exchange rate stopped tightening and returned to normal, and the securities dealers increased their sales efforts. At the same time, retail investors also showed a strong desire to sell. As a result, those looking to buy paused to observe, causing a sharp drop to a low of 3710 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange firm resumed buying, lifting the price by fifteen yuan. By closing, the price was 3722 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange rate softened slightly after the noon close, causing the opening price to rise by thirteen yuan. Afterwards, the exchange market turned sluggish, and the gold price showed little fluctuation, only rising or falling by about ten yuan. The securities dealers continued to sell, while a certain gold firm and money exchange firm absorbed, without any reaction. By the late close, the price was still 3733 yuan, a further increase of twenty-nine yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was quite brisk in the morning, but somewhat quiet in the afternoon, with a total of 2350 taels traded. Jewelry gold was listed at a premium of five yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Continues to Rise, Up 29 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the momentum of the previous day. With the exchange market tightening, general speculators were excited. Brokers shouted loudly, and a certain money exchange firm showed particularly strong buying interest. The market opened with a jump of twenty-six yuan, with the securities dealers taking in twenty taels of gold at 3730 yuan. Afterwards, more buyers surged in, sending the price soaring another twenty-five yuan, with the money exchange firm acquiring thirty taels of gold at 3755 yuan. Subsequently, because the securities dealers leaned towards selling, and the money exchange firm's appetite turned sluggish, the price suddenly dropped, soon falling back twenty-five yuan. The securities dealers sold fifty taels to jewelry dealers at 3730 yuan. Then, with the jewelry dealers continuing to absorb, and the exchange market still tight, the price rose another fifteen yuan, with the money exchange firms trading seventy taels among themselves at 3745 yuan. At that time, the exchange rate suddenly turned firm, and selling resumed. The jewelry dealers also stopped buying, and the securities dealers' selling pressure was strong, immediately falling back twenty yuan. The jewelry dealers sold thirty taels to the money exchange firms at 3725 yuan. Later, the buying sound of a certain money exchange firm was very loud, forcibly taking in over five hundred taels. For a time, many bulls took the opportunity to raise prices, although quite a few retail investors came out to sell, but the price was eventually raised fifteen yuan. A certain money exchange firm took in twenty taels from a fellow firm at 3740 yuan. Afterwards, the money exchange firm stopped absorbing, and the price immediately fell back. The securities dealers and a certain Yu &amp; Co., along with retail investors, rushed to sell. With the exchange market continuing to firm, most of those looking to buy observed, and the market lacked support. Before long, it collapsed thirty yuan, with the money exchange firms selling twenty taels to a certain silver firm at 3710 yuan. Near noon, there were reports that the exchange rate had stopped loosening and was slightly tightening, and sellers gradually decreased. In addition, a certain money exchange firm resumed buying, and the underlying trend became firm again, soon rising fifteen yuan. A certain money exchange firm took in twenty taels from the jewelry dealers at 3725 yuan. Later, the securities dealers sold thirty yuan to the money exchange firms, a small discount of three yuan, for a noon closing price of 3722 yuan. It was heard that after the close, the exchange rate softened slightly, pulling the price up to around 3730 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, a certain gold firm was the first to pull in, raising the price by several yuan, acquiring thirty taels from the money exchange firms, one at 3735 yuan. Then, floating shorts covered their positions, and the price rose another five yuan, with the jewelry dealers taking in twenty taels from the money exchange firms at 3740 yuan. Afterwards, the securities dealers came back to release their pressure, and the rising momentum faltered, falling back eleven yuan. The securities dealers released ten taels to the gold firm at 3729 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange firm searched for and bought over one hundred taels, and the securities dealers stopped releasing and observed, again raising the price six yuan. A certain money exchange firm took in thirty taels from the gold firm at 3735 yuan. Later, the securities dealers sold twenty taels to the gold firm at 3733 yuan, the closing price for the evening. As a result, the price continued to rise twenty-nine yuan compared to the previous day, fluctuating forty-five yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold firm's own brand of gold was ten yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by a little over twenty yuan. The current standard gold was listed five or six tens of yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e71">British and American Gold Bills in High Demand <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market situation, because of the economic mission of Mr. Kodama's visit to China, people were nervous. Clients absorbed British and American gold pounds very hard, and the market price was strong and rising. British and American gold bills were also in high demand, and the market price was outstanding. The British gold bill rose to 40 yuan and 8 cents, and the American gold bill rose to 12 yuan and 1 cent. The market situation was stable in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e72">Securities: Domestic Bonds Show Strong Buying Interest; Foreign Stock Market is Exceptionally Strong <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market situation: the environment was still unfavorable to the bulls. Since both sides were silent on the issue of peace negotiations, and the previously rumored mediator was overwhelmed, one side sent Kodama to China, with a very large conspiracy. The bulls were on guard against drastic changes, and were struggling to fiercely pull up the prices after they had fallen. After the noon close, they used the space to buy a small number of shares, and the market price rose again. Class C shares rose again above the 7-yuan mark, but the bulls' barriers were also built higher as a result, and many floating shorts were liquidated. Yesterday morning, Chang Kee and Tung Hong bought in at the low, and No. 41 increased its holdings again, so after Sheng Da sold out and continued to fall, it immediately rose. Wing Hong, Yik Da, and other firms also supplied, but many retail investors filled their positions along with the market. The noon close reversed from a decline to a rise. In the afternoon, Da Hong, Cheng Yuan, and Da Song Mao bought in again, while Xie Da, San Kai, and others sold, and the bulls and bears fought fiercely. However, market rumors did not stop, and the market prices mostly recovered by 1 to 4 cents. 96 shares were traded at 5 cents, totaling about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 20 shares of Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 67 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce stock market saw a small number of floating longs emerge in the morning, and the price support was good. Steel stocks alone were outstanding, continuing the upward trend of the previous day. The closing price in the morning was 16 yuan and 40 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, all stocks again showed a strong upward trend. Although many people took profits, buyers still occupied an absolute advantage, and the closing market situation was extremely firm.</p>
<p>London, 22nd dispatch: Today, the listing prices of Country A's foreign bonds returned to stability, and all public bonds in the upper and lower ranges remained unchanged.

<h3 id="e73">Yarn and Cotton: Increased Costs, Optimism for Cotton Yarn, Many Speculators Buying, Prices Rise by Around 10 Yuan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The bullish trend in the yarn market has revived. This is because although overseas American cotton is stable, the Indian cotton market is advancing single-mindedly, and the upward trend is fierce, causing excitement. Currently, because inventories are still plentiful, there is no major obstacle for the time being. Everyone is optimistic about the future, because going forward, factory costs will increase daily. Therefore, those who have no goods in hand are coming back to buy a few bales to speculate, and although Hong Kong merchants have not developed in large quantities, they are also buying with confidence in view of the expensive raw materials, so it is not as sluggish as in the past.</p>
<p>When the current yarn market opened in the morning, fellow merchants gathered, and Indian cotton prices advanced steadily, jumping another ten rupees, stirring up sentiment and raising prices. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened with a rise of ten yuan, to 653 yuan. Then, as the exchange rate tightened, sentiment became even tighter. However, those who made profits closed their positions, falling back four or five yuan, but there were still many people buying in. It is estimated that 1490 bales were traded in half a day. The prices of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 9 yuan, Tian Nu yarn by 8 yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu yarn by 6 yuan. The amounts purchased by each merchant are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Merchants 660 Hong Kong 530</p>
<p>Xiamen 60 Ningbo 90 Mainland 120</p>
<p>Total 1495</p>
<h3 id="e74">Indian Cotton Prices Rise More Sharply; Brazilian Cotton Traded Yesterday <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Cotton trading continued to progress, but factory transactions decreased due to price issues. However, fellow merchants are mostly bullish in view of the advancing Indian cotton, so trading is extremely prosperous. Fortunately, the situation in American cotton is still peaceful, and the market price is hampered by it, otherwise the upward trend would be very strong. And the price of American cotton is cheaper than that of Indian cotton, and the color is also beautiful, so the purchase orders of fellow merchants and factories are increasing daily. There are some purchases in Qingdao, all of which are Brazilian cotton, 1 inch 1/16 fine velvet, the raw material for spinning fine 32-count yarn, but the amount is not large, so the cotton market's upward force is still gentle. However, in addition to the rise of 2 yuan for regular cotton, the source of Su Bei is relatively scarce, because the rain is continuous, and transportation in the countryside is inconvenient, so the arrival of goods is slightly less. 892 bales of regular cotton arrived, 489 bales of Chang Yin Sha cotton, and 720 pieces of Bei Sha Lai cotton. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, continued to rise in the morning due to telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reporting soaring prices. Later, because Southern merchants sold short in the market, and longs took profits, the market situation turned weak, and as a result, the closing price fell by five or six British pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market continued to soar, rising another eight rupees yesterday along with forecasts. Egyptian cotton also rose by five or sixty British pounds. Liverpool rose by over twenty pence.</p>
<p>There has been no progress in the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai in recent days. Chinese factories have stopped operating for many days, and the industry is very quiet. However, Japanese manufacturers have recently had small-scale spot transactions, all of which are lower-grade American cotton, all of which are shipped in December. The factory price including tax converted from the American exchange rate of 8.5 yuan is as follows:</p>
<p>20-count Good Middling American 166.40</p>
<p>And Same grade lower 160.20</p>
<p>32-count Same 172.55</p>
<p>And Same grade lower 164.85</p>
<p>42-count Same 175.65</p>
<p>And Same grade lower 166.40</p>
<h3 id="e75">Grains: Foreign Rice Already Being Sold; Japonica and Indica Rice Damp and Being Sold Off <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, each merchant's source arrived with a total of thirty-six or seven cars of goods from Su Jia Kun Tai Feng Qing, etc., with a number of nearly five thousand packages. The continuous rain has caused a large number of goods to be waterlogged on the way. This kind of waterlogged goods is most prone to change and cannot be left unattended, so general merchants are eager to sell in order to avoid losses, and the source is crowded. The market has been exhausted, and hoarding households are selling out one after another after making profits. In such an environment, the minds of both buyers and sellers are discouraged. Early in the morning, the situation was soft, and the general waterlogged goods were sold off at a low price of one yuan. Afterwards, the stores in this town became even more indifferent, and the prices of each cargo fell step by step under mutual competition. As a result, whether it was Japonica rice or Yin Bian Yuan, the market price was shortened by one or two yuan compared to the previous price. Chang Jian Te Japonica was 35 yuan, Su Kun white Japonica was 32 to 33 yuan, middle and second grade was 30 to 29 yuan, Qing Jiao Bo Dao Te was 31 yuan, ordinary ones were about 30 yuan, Jia Bo Dao was 29 yuan and 50 cents to 29 yuan, Lu Yang Jian was 31 to 32 yuan, Jing Jian was 31 yuan to 29 and a half yuan, Chen Xin Bian Yuan was 33 to 34 yuan, Yin Yuan was 31 to 32 yuan, and the total sales were only four or five thousand packages. Looking back at the rice market, since the continuous decline in prices, the current market price of special goods has fallen by about five yuan compared with the previous high price, and the price of Zhong Guan goods and customer tip has fallen by about seven yuan. In short, this wave of price increases was entirely caused by the manipulation of speculators, and its foundation was originally floating. Now that this situation has been formed, it seems difficult to change in a short period of time, because since each inland area heard about the Shanghai market's skyrocketing prices, the markets in the two places have merged, and profits can be made by transporting goods out of the country. Large amounts of foreign rice will also arrive in Shanghai in the shortest possible period of time. At that time, the stacks will be full and the people will have no need to hoard food. How can these speculators continue to use their magic to cause trouble? It is hoped that rice prices will gradually fall back to normal, and we can rejoice!</p>
<p>Yesterday, scattered heads of customer Indica rice arrived and continued to be sold, and the sellers and large profit-making households were eager to sell. Since the arrival of green rice from the country has been booming for days, and foreign rice has continued to be ordered, people's minds have been weak. Yesterday, in addition to a large number of damp rice being sold off at a discount, foreign rice arrived, and the situation became even weaker. The market opened with a downward trend, and was smaller than the previous market by one yuan. Gao Ke Indica was only 31 and a half yuan, and the middle and second grade was as low as about 30 yuan. The buyers were watching, and the total sales were only over a thousand packages.</p>
<p>Affected by the continued decline in Japonica and Indica rice, the new transactions of foreign rice were silent. However, the grain merchants originally planned to transport 30,000 packages from Hong Kong, which have been loaded and transported by Wo Sang and Ming Sang. Yesterday, the first batch of more than 2,000 packages was opened, which was No. 1 round long grain and No. 2 rice. It is said to be An Nam Japonica rice. The new arrival of foreign rice is quite popular in the shop. The price of the original package of 198 catties was discussed at 40 yuan the night before, but yesterday it has dropped to 38 yuan, and 160 catties are sold at 33 yuan for long grain and 32 yuan for round grain. The No. 2 is 31 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Oil Market: New Prices for Soybean Oil Reach Peak After Peak <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market was still extremely hot. The bull companies still had no intention of selling, and the source was intermittent. The market price rose by another two or three yuan. At the moment, the overall situation is completely controlled by the manipulators, so new high prices are emerging one after another. The general traders are still blindly dragging in. Yesterday, it was estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 58 yuan and 50 cents, 50 pieces of Yan Qi oil at a price of 62 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao oil at a price of 82 yuan, and 10 barrels of Tianjin oil at a price of 81 yuan. Peanut oil was constrained by soybean oil. The Hong Kong merchants had already inspected it yesterday, and only the merchants had a way out. The market price rose by another one or two yuan. It is estimated that 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 62 yuan and 50 cents, 30 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil at a price of 78 yuan and 50 cents, and 500 cans of canned oil, with prices rising from 79 yuan and 70 cents to 80 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was more firm due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The Shanghai Sugar Exchange quoted spot prices of 24 rough white sugar at 51.5 yuan for the local warehouse and 52 to 52.5 yuan for the foreign warehouse. The price for transit goods was 41.5 yuan. The Tai Gu Che brand white B mark East Machine was 55 yuan, the West Warehouse was 55.5 yuan, the brand W was 55 yuan, CX was 54 yuan, DY was 53 yuan, HX mark was 52.5 yuan, and HC was 39 yuan.

The domestic sugar was quite firm due to the lack of spot goods. Huanggang Qing was slightly tighter, with over 300 bags traded at 36.2 to 36 yuan. Ordinary Huizhou white sugar was 51 yuan, and high Hainan red sugar was 32.5 yuan, with a total of hundreds of bags traded. Today, 750 bags of rice and sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's silk market: Yokohama was closed for holidays, New York spot prices were unchanged, near-term prices rose by 1.5 cents, and far-term prices rose by 2 cents. The general market situation is gradually developing in a stable manner. The local silk market, white factory 78 points market price was 4150 yuan. Yesterday, the original market was still open. Ha He Ren Ji, Da Chang and other foreign firms jointly purchased 210 piculs. If the exchange rate is favorable to export trade, then the local silk market will be active again. However, in the current situation, it only shortens the distance between domestic and foreign silk prices. Observing yesterday's local silk market, people's minds were quite stable, and the general elites had no harsh demands on silk prices. Therefore, the silk market can be expected to be more active than last week.</p>

Therefore, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram to inform the college to open, and the college has complied with the order and officially started classes yesterday.</p>

<p>Four youth basketball games were played last night, half in the A group and half in the B group. The game between Qianghua and Lingyou in the B group was very intense. At halftime, Qianghua was behind by one point, 8-9. In the second half, Lingyou committed numerous fouls. Qianghua made every free throw, and finally won 26-24, coming from behind. In the two A group games, Pengbi's strength was weaker than Xufang's. After Xufang led 15-0, Pengbi's main players Li Feiyun, Zhang Wenyuan, and Wang Shoufang entered the game successively, and their coordination gradually improved. However, due to the excessive losses at the beginning, they suffered a crushing defeat of 30-53. In the first half, Xufang also led 11-29. The results of each game are as follows:</p>

<p>The Peicheng Girls' Middle School table tennis team, led by physical education director Zhu Zhiying, played a friendly match against the Girls' Youth table tennis team at the Girls' Christian Association auditorium yesterday. The Girls' Youth's main players Huang Tongyin, Hu Jiahe, and Fang Xiuwen were all absent, which greatly affected their strength. Although Peicheng Girls' continuously defeated the Girls' Youth in three matches, the players were in excellent spirits. In the fourth group, Feng Mingyin's steady shots defeated the Girls' Youth's Zhu Min, which was commendable. The fifth group also won, and the situation became tense. Wang Guangmei, a rising star of the Girls' Youth, played against Zhang Lizhu, the main player of Peicheng, which was quite dangerous. Fortunately, under the guidance of Chen Linsheng, she used short blocks throughout the match. Zhang eventually became exhausted from the smashes and was defeated by Wang. Wang's short blocks were highly skilled, earning constant applause. In the end, the Girls' Youth defeated Peicheng Girls' Middle School 4-3. The results of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e94">Returning from the Sino-Western Flower Show <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Qing</p>
<p>Yesterday, I braved the rain to visit the autumn flower show held by the Sino-Western Flower Society at the Racecourse. Upon entering the second gate, I saw rows of large, lush chrysanthemums lining the walkway, creating a path of flowers. In the first hall on the right, a beautiful scene unfolded before me. Along the wall on the right side, the Shanghai Municipal Council's parks displayed chrysanthemums arranged as a chrysanthemum mountain.</p>
<p>In the center, occupying the largest area, were many large and small dining tables, all decorated by Western ladies. There were flower arrangements, knives, plates... One table used all kinds of splendid silverware and was the most luxurious, but it only won third prize. Another table was very simple, covered with a light green tablecloth, with light green candles, and a large pile of vegetables in the middle. The colors were very harmonious, and the arrangement was simple and natural, winning first prize. In the very center, I found a mahogany round table with a Chinese banquet on it. Looking at the Western name on the colorful prize certificate, I realized that the exhibitor was the cultured Mr. Zhou Shoujuan. In the center was a tall flower arrangement made of a tree root carved into pine and cranes, with a poem by Zhu Sanyou and another poem by Songshishanren of the Qianlong era inscribed on it. Many drooping red Phoenix Tail chrysanthemums were inserted into this flower arrangement, and a lingzhi mushroom stood tall on the side. On that side was also a pair of bronze crane candlesticks with two red candles, creating a solemn atmosphere. Around the table were small square and round lacquer trays with mother-of-pearl inlay of figures, which were certainly exquisite. All the carved ivory chopsticks and porcelain bowls with tin rims, and the green-ground five-color wine cups were old Qianlong-Jiaqing items. To the left of each set of cups and chopsticks stood name cards of Ye Yuhu, Wu Daiqiu, Fan Shaoyun, Zhao Ziyun, etc., each painted with a plum blossom. This table was antique and elegant, a credit to the Chinese.</p>
<p>In front of this Chinese-style dining table were three large tables. The middle one had five pieces, including two pots of rocks and water, which resembled landscapes in paintings, very natural. Behind it, on a high flower stand, was a large tripod bronze incense burner. Next to a large stone bamboo shoot was a large hooked yellow chrysanthemum, arranged in a semi-cliff shape, also full of artistic sense. On the left side table was a ten-scene cabinet, containing twenty pieces of small potted plants and statues of Bodhidharma from Beifeng Lingbi, exquisite and small, bizarre and colorful. On top was a half-drooping pine in a pot, with a Bodhidharma statue sitting under the pine, like an ancient painting. Next to the cabinet was a lion-mane yellow chrysanthemum, paired with Ying stone and lingzhi, with the flower positions well-arranged and several bamboo fences inserted, clearly representing the remnants of chrysanthemums by the eastern fence. On the right side table was a short table with a pot of wintergreen with hanging roots and a small bronze statue of Sakyamuni in the center. In front of it was a shallow pot made of Han Dynasty bricks, arranged with a forest of tiger thorn, with red berries in clusters, bright and vibrant. Next to these three tables was a large silver cup, probably the prize. Several Western men and women were crowded around the table, asking a Chinese man in a Zhongshan suit questions. They were calling him Mr. Chow. Then I suddenly realized that this was the exhibitor, Mr. Zhou Shoujuan. I originally wanted to get to know him, so I waited for the Western men and women to leave, then shyly went up to introduce myself and asked him about everything. Mr. Zhou answered very politely, saying that he participated in the competition in both spring and autumn, firstly because he had been interested in potted plants for ten years, and secondly because Westerners have always looked down on Chinese gardening, so he wanted to win back some face. This time, he actually won the highest prize of the entire show - the large silver cup of Sir Peter Greay, like the Davis Cup of the international tennis tournament, which can be kept for half a year, and returned to the show in the spring flower show next year, when the show will engrave his name on it and give him a smaller silver cup, which can be kept permanently. I remember that Mr. Zhou said a thought-provoking sentence in the conversation: "I hope that everyone in the world becomes a flower lover, so that everyone is happy and peaceful, and perhaps there will be no more wars." This sentence is worth pondering. I lingered here for a full hour before thanking him and leaving. Outside, I also saw a table displayed by Mr. Kong Zhiqing, which was also full of antiquity, and had the same effect as Mr. Zhou's.</p>
<p>Back home, I had a dream that night - a flower-like dream.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Problem of Discipline for Elementary School Students <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Fallen Leaf</p>
<p>I have been an elementary school teacher for several years, but I have doubts about my own eight-year-old child's "schooling problem." Because I am too familiar with the "inside story" of elementary schools in this metropolis, when school started this autumn, I hesitated again: "Should I send her to school again?" I really wanted to educate her myself. However, because "family education" is too monotonous, no matter how dubious I am about elementary school education in this metropolis, I still believe that "school education" with its collective life is suitable for children's nature. So I sent my daughter to a relatively large elementary school again.</p>
<p>In less than two months, this eight-year-old girl has left me with two very profound impressions. I feel that "the problem of discipline for elementary school students" is worth discussing with all elementary schools in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first impression I got was: I remember one day, when my child came home for lunch, she was not as talkative and happy as usual. She was just listless, with some heavy thoughts on her mind. I was very strange, so I asked her what was making her unhappy. She replied slowly: "Dad! Today, in our class, a classmate was hit on the palm of her hand by the teacher more than a dozen times, crying as loud as firecrackers! Dad, I'm really scared. This teacher often hits people when he's unhappy!" What made this child still look dazed and worried was the sound of the elementary school student being hit crying as loud as "firecrackers" which shocked her whole mind. I fully understand the painful situation of elementary school teachers now. "Often being unhappy" is the distress of elementary school teachers. However, it is very big to affect the elementary school students themselves with one's own joys, sorrows, and happiness. Here, I hope that elementary school teachers who are "often unhappy" will please not vent their "complaints" on innocent and innocent children.</p>
<p>The first impression I got was: One day, after my child came home for lunch and finished eating, she asked her mother to put some powder on her little face, preferably some rouge. I was very surprised to hear that. Although everyone has a love of beauty, my little girl is only eight years old. Sometimes, if she gets a little cold, her snot will still hang out. What's more, her pursuit of beauty is so "vulgar" that she wants to apply powder and rouge? This really puzzled me. I asked her, and she said: "The teachers in our school always like female students who wear powder and rouge, so I want to be like that too." Hearing this, I was both surprised and angry. I really wanted to not send my little girl to school anymore, or write a letter to the school to scold them severely. But then I thought: such things may be very common, why not write an article and submit it to the newspaper, to arouse the attention of all elementary schools in Shanghai to this kind of indiscretion of elementary school teachers in their behavior, thus affecting the pure psychology of elementary school students. In this extraordinary period, elementary schools should thoroughly think about and arrange "the problem of discipline for elementary school students". This will not only greatly help our next generation, but also the establishment of our future new country. The purpose of writing this article is also here.</p>
<h3 id="e96">After the Rain, a Clear Sky <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tian</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Old City; Describing Marriage Plunder and Tracing Back the Legacy</p>
<p>At this time, Wu Junzi helped Zhu Airen arrange her car, because she had driven her car back to Suzhou after returning from Shanghai. They indeed hired a large car, fortunately they didn't have much luggage, at most each carried a small suitcase. So the five of them sat in the car, still very comfortable. Shao Huihua also came out of the dormitory with them, watched them all get into the car, and then straddled her motorcycle, smiled back at Wu Junsu and others, and said: "I'll wait for you at the train station!" Seeing her leather shoes lightly exerting force, the motorcycle seemed like a wisp of light smoke, flying forward. At first, the car chased behind, still visible, but after a while it disappeared. Because Shao Huihua's motorcycle was the latest American model, it made no noise when it was running. Unlike the previous motorcycles, the noise was the loudest and most terrifying. When their car arrived at the train station, Shao Huihua was already there, and had already handed her motorcycle over to the luggage car manager. But the train hadn't arrived yet, because this train was called the Liaohu Through Train. Why is it called the Liaohu Through Train? It's the train that runs all the way from Liaoning to Shanghai. This can be considered a main road from north to south in China. Liaoning used to be called Fengtian, because in the past, when the Chinese capital was in Beijing, there was also a train that ran to Beijing, and that road was called the Beining Railway. Later, Beijing was renamed Beiping, although the trains between Pingjin still traveled frequently. But there was also a train that came in from outside the pass to Tianjin every day, and then connected to the Jinghu Road from the Jinpu Road, and ran straight to Shanghai, which was this train. Wu Junsu looked at her own watch and said, "It's almost here! Five minutes to go, let's go to the platform to wait." It turns out that the time of Chinese trains is now very accurate. It says it will arrive at the station at a certain point, a certain ten minutes and a certain minutes, it will definitely arrive on time. Because the train timetable is like a formulated law. Lateness is indeed not allowed, and early arrival is also inconvenient. Some people say: lateness is indeed not good, passengers keep the time and come to the station. But what about the car? Left waiting does not come, right waiting does not come, missing the time, making the things that passengers have to do by keeping the time unable to be done, isn't that a waste of time? Wouldn't it be better to arrive early? I arrive at the station in advance, and the train is already parked at the station, isn't that better? But now China's railways are not all double-tracked. In many places, there are regulations for crossing cars and letting cars, etc. Otherwise, wouldn't it be chaotic. (206)</p>

<h3 id="e97">George Bernard Shaw Urges Establishment of Soldiers' Theaters <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>According to a Reuter's report from London on the 11th, the humorous master George Bernard Shaw recently sent a letter to the Times urging the speedy opening of London theaters, etc.</p>
<p>Currently, although two-thirds of the 4,000 cinemas in the UK have reopened, most of the theaters in London that stage stage plays have not yet resumed business. British Labor Minister Brown, along with representatives selected from the Actors' Association, the Musicians' Union, the Artists' Union, the National Theater Employees' Society, and other groups, also jointly submitted a document to the authorities, requesting the opening of London theaters as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The document pointed out that unless all the theaters in London and other major cities are reopened, thousands upon thousands of people who depend on theaters for a living will immediately suffer tragic unemployment.</p>
<p>In his open letter, Shaw also frankly told us: During the last European war, we had 8,000 soldiers going to the theater every night in London to enjoy the performances on the screen. The general situation at that time was really quite enthusiastic. But now, we haven't even seen one "soldiers' theater."</p>
<p>"Therefore, the authorities should immediately open the current theaters and build new ones specifically for the soldiers. Every actor and film industry personnel, unless they have more important duties, should not be allowed to stop working!" Shaw earnestly hoped in his letter.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: In view of the fact that Chinese soldiers indeed do not have much entertainment enjoyment, I think that this kind of theater specifically established for soldiers is also urgently needed in China at present.</p>

<p>Jiang Juncao's lofty aspirations: Jiang Juncao and his wife Bai Lu live next door to a guest who is an aircraft repair engineer at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport. Every time there is a new aircraft or after an aircraft is repaired, they are invited to ride. They have been airborne many times. On the 14th of this month, they again test-flew a newly arrived large aircraft, which can carry more than 20 people and is intended to operate on the Hong Kong-Chongqing route. The Jiangs learned of this news and, with the engineer's consent, specially invited Wang Naidong, Peng Fei, and others to ride together. Wang and others had never been on an airplane before, and were all very interested to be able to ride. Jiang Juncao has a great interest in engaging in aviation, and his physique already meets the standards.</p>
<p>Ancient costume films are popular in Hong Kong: Mandarin ancient costume films are box office hits in Hong Kong, mostly booming. Cantonese film merchants are envious and are also shooting "Yue Fei," "Yang Guifei," and "Empress Dowager Cixi." However, Cantonese films mostly cut corners, and the talent is declining, making it difficult to compete with Mandarin ancient costume films. Even in the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines, Mandarin films are valued more than Cantonese films. If Mandarin films can do well, then there is no fear that Cantonese films will not be defeated.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng hired by Nanyang: The Dadi Film Company moved to Kunming to work. Some of the original staff were willing to go, while others did not. Cai Chusheng, the director of "Island Paradise," had originally decided to go, but is now staying in Hong Kong. When Cai directed "Island Paradise," in addition to a monthly living expense of 50 yuan, he also had a director's fee of 1,000 yuan, a generous treatment. In principle, he should still work for Dadi, but the Nanyang Company here (that is, the Hong Kong factory of Tianyi Company) recently has a plan to also shoot Mandarin films and is willing to pay 1,000 Hong Kong dollars to ask Cai to write and direct a film, so Cai is in a dilemma.</p>

<p>Zhou Weijun, a rising star of Xiaosheng who was hired by Genxin for the first time in Shanghai, has been praised by the people of Shanghai since his performance. The actor is handsome and unrestrained, especially good at singing, and has a good foundation in martial arts. Weijun is proficient in both civil and military roles, and can be called a versatile talent. According to Weijun's unique talent, he is known as the Iron Throat. In the old capital, he and Ye ShengLan Yu Zhenfei were known as the two outstanding Xiaosheng. This time, he made a stunning appearance in Shanghai. Unfortunately, the performance period is very short, and he will soon return north with glory.</p>

<p>The Luye Theater Troupe is scheduled to perform three plays at the Luye Theater this Sunday: (1) The Problem of Love, (2) People Who Enjoy Themselves, and a one-act play, The Executioner.

In People Who Enjoy Themselves, Zhou Houzhang will play the father, Qiu Quan will play the son, Liu Jing will play the daughter-in-law, and Zhen Jing will play the daughter. As for the role of Little Wang, it will again be played by Wu Xinru. These are all very promising rising stars. They gave us a good impression when they performed for the first time. It can be said that they will have better results in future performances after more than half a month of hard rehearsals.</p>

<p>"Legend of the White Snake" was adapted by Chen Dabei and Yang Xiaozhong, removing its mythology and retaining its essence. It describes the darkness of feudal society incisively. Chen Yanyan plays the White Lady, Tong Yuejuan plays Xiaoqing, and Sun Min plays Xu Xian. It has now been completed and will be released in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Modern Woman Warrior "Wang Baochuan" <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Fen</p>
<p>Among the many popular unofficial historical romances, "Wang Baochuan" is the most worthy of attention. It not only occupies every corner of cities, villages, and even remote borderlands, but also, through the introduction of playwright Xiong Shi-i, it has brought to overseas audiences the image of the first brave woman in traditional feudal society who raised an iron spear to break through the barriers of old ethical teachings. In the past, it was rare, or even non-existent, for Chinese drama to gain international acclaim, but "Wang Baochuan" planted the first seed.</p>
<p>The "Wang Baochuan" in the movie is even more idealized. She becomes a successful woman resisting the war. When the enemy's iron hooves cross the border of her motherland, she does not hesitate to shout the slogan of defending the motherland. She is a hero, a warrior, standing at the forefront of national thought. The belief in certain victory for eighteen years is established in her consciousness like an iron pillar. Finally, the warriors return with smiles, and the era of final victory is finally realized.</p>

<p>— Xu Mu</p>
<p>Both North and South Have a Figure of Worship</p>
<p>(1) When he was serving in the inner court, a certain actor, due to illness and lack of strength, looked unsightly. While he was performing a certain play on stage, the Empress Dowager suddenly said to those around her, "Why does today's De Bao look like a jinx?" Later, Rui Ling heard about this and was greatly worried. He often said to people, "The Old Buddha's words are golden and jade. The last time she rewarded me with cherries, she saw me so scared that I swallowed the pits, and she said I was a silly boy. This time she said I was a jinx, so from now on I am doomed." Strangely enough, since Old Rui left Beijing, he has performed in Jinan, Xuzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places, but he has never been very successful in the past twenty years. Someone asked him why he was so down and out, and he replied very cleverly, "She said I was an imperial jinx, so don't even think about becoming popular again in this lifetime." (2) His wife passed away very early, and he lost his wife in middle age, leaving behind two sons and a daughter. He had to sing opera and take care of his children. He wrote all his grievances on yellow paper, burned it with fire, and prayed to heaven. Someone asked him what he meant, and he said, "I have a belly full of grievances that are difficult to tell in the human world, so I specially wrote this to present my grievances to the Jade Emperor." More than ten years ago, he came to Shanghai and rented a room in a small alley east of the Empire. The house was very small and the stairs were narrow. Coincidentally, his eldest son, Feng Qi, suffered from severe lung disease, already in the third stage. The landlord was so frightened that he urged him to move out every day. At that time, he had no money to move, and he hired a small doctor to see him. At that time, I was saddened and, regardless of the danger of lung disease transmission, I gave up a pavilion room for his dying son to recover. Who would have thought that Feng Qi would die in seven days! (148)</p>
