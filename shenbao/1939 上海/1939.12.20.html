<h3 id="c10">南大西洋海軍戰與美洲安全 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>英巡洋艦阿傑克斯號會同另兩巡洋艦埃基勒斯與愛克斯脫，在南大西洋，將德國袖珍戰鬥艦格拉夫斯比上將號擊敗·逃人南美烏拉圭國境內的蒙特維台澳港內修理，終於自鑿沉沒。這雖是一次小規模的海軍的遭遇戰，就戰事本身講，算不上什麼重要，不能和一九一六年英德在北海希德蘭的海軍大會戰比擬，並且這次英德海戰對於歐陸上的戰爭，也沒有什麼重大影響。至多不過暴露德國袖珍戰鬥艦並不如德國人所誇示的那般精銳而已。原來袖珍艦的艦身，是鎔合而成，並非用鉸釘合成。其「狄塞爾」發動引擎可使其速度每小時達二十六海里，其汽缸也足夠維持在每小時十海里的進程中，巡行萬里。其武裝有十一英寸口徑之大砲六門。照理英國戰鬥艦以下的軍艦，都不是其敵手，因爲英國巡洋艦上的砲，沒有超過八英寸口徑的。據德國人估計，擊敗一個德國袖珍艦，至少須六隻巡洋艦，現在英國三艘巡洋艦，就將斯比上將號擊敗，致死亡甚衆。德國海軍的力量，就這件事講，已顯然不能和英國較一日的短長。所以南大西洋英德海軍遭遇戰，就戰爭的意義上講，僅僅只有這一點。而就其他方面講，則其關係，頗爲複雜。我們知道，英德這次海軍遭遇戰，　地點是在靠近美洲的南大西洋，而遭遇戰的結果，德國軍艦，又逃往中立國的烏拉圭海港內。無論戰爭的規模大小如何，戰爭的波動，已侵入世外桃源的美洲。不但此也，交戰國的軍艦，照國際公法的規定，只有七十二小時可逗留。否則須受拘留，以待戰事終了以後，才能退出。所以德國袖珍艦斯比上將號如欲不被扣留，只有冒險脫逃。不過英國方面，早有一萬噸巡洋艦坎伯蘭號與七千噸巡洋艦埃基勒斯號，主力艦雷囊號巴拉哈姆號，、航空工母艦亞克號，及法國方面主力艦鄧扣號，在鄰近海面遊弋，以等待斯比上將號的衝出而將之捕獲。爲此斯比上將號只有自沉的一途。二次海戰，是不會發生了。美國國務卿赫爾聲明，即使發生第二次海戰。也僅能視爲第一次海戰的繼續，因之不能構成第二次違反中立區行動，可是上次巴拿瑪會議中所提議的在美洲沿海劃出三百里地帶爲安全區的計劃，早爲這次英德的海戰所打消。英政府外交發言人所謂：美洲各國欲爲美洲大陸保持和平，此項願意，自為英國所瞭解，而願予以尊重，特在戰爭進行之中，仍以軍略與作虞夥前提，而外交觀點次之，美洲各國艦隊，倘能維持此項安全區域的中立，而使各交戰國咸能予以尊重，英國實無間言，否則徒足以便利德國潛艇與軍艦進行海盜式戰爭，自非英國所能坐視。要之，　　英國對於安全區域，迄未加以承認，且曾聲明保留一切權利。其所承認者，亦惟三英里的領海而已」這乾脆地說明英國所注意的問題，惟其戰略上的便利是視，而其他一切問題，都是决要的。這意義就是顯示即在南美海洋上，也沒有所謂安全區，這也就是說即使在美洲大陸上。根本不能超然於戰爭之外。那些美國的孤立主義派如上議員客拉克等人，認爲美國某部分人對於某一國家進犯美國的領土的恐懼，是最最可笑的幻想，美國需要三比一的龐大海軍始能進襲某一國家。、而某一國家要進襲美國，也需要有三比一的海軍，這純粹根據了上次大戰中的經騐，而忘記了由於航空交通及運輸近來發展的結果，使空間的限制，變爲一個極不重要的障碍，我們希望他從這次南大西洋的海軍交戰中，得了一個事實的敎訓，從而知道美國並不是可以關起門來從戰中嫌取血錢而永遠不會受到別國威脅的。</p>

<p>倫敦邱吉爾海相頃在下議院報告近日海戰情形、尤注重德國袖珍戰鬬艦、「斯比上將」號鑿况情形、其言有曰、該艦在南人西洋襲擊各國商船、已數星期於茲、今旣自行毀滅、各國商船至少可暫時享有海上自由、該艦前於本月十三日與英國巡洋艦三艘作戰時、雖其裝甲較厚、其大砲射程亦復較遠、但終於避往中立國港口、爲該艦計、當時不外兩種出路、一即聽由烏拉圭國政府扣留、一即開出蒙德維台奧港、與英艦決戰、一如吾國輔助巡洋艦拉華爾賓第號前此所爲、以吾人所見、第二途實最爲光榮、詎知該艦不此之圖、其駛離中立國港口、並非準備作戰、乃欲自行鑿沉、此其用意、殊屬不解、又况該艦當時明知英國主力艦雷囊號·航空母艦亞克號、正在巴西國京城內添裝燃料、相去上下一千英里、艦之在烏拉圭海岸以外、環伺該艦駛出者、有配置六吋口徑砲之巡洋艦阿傑克斯號與埃基勒斯號兩艘、亦即日前相與一度作戰之兩艘、此外、尚有配置八吋口徑砲之巡洋艦坎白蘭號、則係替代受創之愛克斯脫號、可見吾方並未運用更大之力量、加以壓迫、至以本月十三日海戰情形而論、吾方損失亦殊不小、此際不妨坦率言之、巡洋艦阿傑克斯號、共有砲樓四座、其中兩座業被敵砲轟去、敵艦並向吾方巡洋艦愛克斯脫號開砲四五十發、其中多數砲彈之重量、均遠在我艦所放射者以上、我國此艦共有八吋口徑砲六門、其中三門、已被擊毀、艦上官兵死傷總數、當在一百員名之譜，其中殉職者允較傷者爲多、然於受創之後、仍駛至蒙德維台奥港外、監視德艦斯比上將號之駛出並準備再與敵艦一決雌雄、直至坎白蘭號駛至、始乃退出戰綫、吾國海軍官之驍勇善戰、此可見一斑矣、</p>
<p>更以吾國潛水艇之戰績向論、其在上星期中、實已獲有極大之成功、吾方潛艇從不襲擊中立國船舶、亦不戚脅弱小之漁船、其活動範圍、乃以德國海軍根據地黑里哥蘭島海面之水雷區與其堅强之防禦錢爲主、因此停泊該港之德國軍艦、鮮有敢越雷池一步者、吾國潛艇薩爾門號、曾在上星期中、與德國郵船白萊門號相值、當時原可予以擊沉、但因遵守國際法規之故、並未向之放射魚雷、該潛艇嗣用魚雷一枚、擊中敵方六千噸巡洋艦一艘、厭後又用魚雷二枚、擊中敵方另一巡洋艦、此二敵艦雖或仍能駛回該國根據地、但無論如何、其在今後數月之內、決難照常服務、此外、吾國潛艇烏爾蘇拉號曾於本月十四日在德國埃爾勃河口、擊沉敵方高恩號級之巡洋艦一艘、於以見在過去一星期中、敵方巡洋艦隊之實力、業已喪失甚多、</p>
<p>至於德國海軍飛機、近日又加緊襲擊漁船及各國未備武裝之商船、甚至義國輪船一艘、亦在英國沿岸被炸、所幸敵機力不從心、其所轟炸之各國輪船、雖有二十四艘之多，但命中者亦僅六艘而已、總之、英國整個航運、絕未因敵方之瘋在舉動而稍有間斷、加拿大聯邦所派出之遠征軍一師、在吾國軍艦護送之下、業已越過重洋、於昨日安抵吾國某港、即其明證、至該師官兵常先在國內加緊訓練、然後調往法國前綫協助作戰、特在此際附帶報明云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>洋米到頭連接、前到正在卸棧外、今明尚有兩船可到、故原包路貨晨市一度小至四十二元半、旋以進活回好二角、午後因滙長又轉平勢、現西貢開三十六元東京秈三十二元二角、統市期現併計成交的有三千包、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、仍無變更、英美匯暗市、承上二日鬆懈之姿態下、繼續告硬、乃以港電力售及浮多斬結故也、惟匯豐乘機吃進不少、致結果鬆勢尚緩、當日經過、晨開與隔昨相仿、嗣因港電本其一貫作風、首來猛塞、加以華行及華商浮戶等亦紛紛競賣、且匯豐吃胃終厭薄弱、趨勢遂形不支、美匯幾破出八元大關、到七元九三七五、英金亦長至四辦士八四三七五、但不久賣風稍殺、而匯豐等外行吃胃漸强、進口商見景紛紛結進遠月美匯、毫不遲疑、同時某華行亦轉賣爲買、迄至午收、英已回至四辦士七五、及美亦回達七元八一二五、惟午後初又轉鬆、此因港電與華商重賣、繼乃匯豐吃胃、依然甚强、且一部份華商見匯豐納胃之宏、重復做多、稍扒遠月美金、故晚收美匯仍告七元八一二五、英金爲四辦士七六五六二五、結果比上日、英鬆〇七八一二五、美硬一二五、聞期貨交易趨勢、緊隨現貨、未有軒輊、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、一般人相信日政府經數月之極度彷徨後、今已決定試向美國獻媚、以傅其歡心、而不與蘇聯相勾結、日本開始此種新政策、將重行開放南京以下之長江、以資試探、而日本未宣佈開放長江、供第三國航行之確切日期、與必須遵守的軍事限制之條件兩點、明示開放長江一舉、乃試騐性質、視美國之反響而定、東京於宣佈開放長江之決定後、立即傳出外務省刻正審愼注視蘇聯態度之消息、衆認此乃「蝴蝶夫人」以目向「山姆叔叔」示意、</p>
<p>日發言人報吿經過</p>
<p>字林報云、關於日方宣布將開放南京以下之長江事、日海軍發言人昨日招待新　聞記者時聲稱、南京以下長江之重行開放、將受因軍事需要曁維持和平與秩序的方法而施之限制、故日當局此項決定、並非長江將完全開放、以供航行之謂、長江兩岸與上游之軍事行動、長此繼續不已、則不得不實施若干限制、此决重行開放、附有條件、而對一般航行之准許、將以不防礙軍事行動爲限、</p>
<p>不得援助華軍作戰</p>
<p>發言人答覆問話稱、長江將在若干種限制下開放、以供航行與貿易、而准外國船隻以及日船載貨、惟不許第三國在長江航行而援助游擊隊或華軍作戰、又若妨礙日方軍事行動、則亦不許航行、</p>
<p>開放日期似甚遙遠</p>
<p>或間口岸數目將吾限制、發言人答稱、刻正進行凖備中、對於此事、尚未完全決定、或有限制口岸數且之必要、渠對於開放之決定、將於何時實行、或尚有多久、始將開放兩點、均不能言定、目今着手之準備、需時當頗久、日方將儘可能從速實行此決定、尚有種種問題須待解決、渠不能預料長江之開放、爲若何迅速、</p>
<p>蕪湖並不包括在內</p>
<p>或問外船將吾准載一般貨物、抑以南京外僑所需之物爲、限發言人答稱、所施限制、並非此種形式、而係不准能用以援助華軍之物料在長江運輸、日方軍事行動所需要之若干物品、亦將加以限制、發言人答覆另一問話稱、所撤銷之限制、不能包括蕪湖在內、日方對此已加研究、發覺因種種軍事需要、不宜將寬她擴張至蕪湖、</p>
<p>日方自詡尊重權益</p>
<p>或問是吾因第三國之要求而開放長江、發言人答稱、禁止長江交通、旣係軍事需要之故、則此種限制之任何寬弛、乃日軍事當局自行決定者、某記者問、長江之重行開放、是否綏和性質、發言人答稱、如一再宣布者、日政府意在尊重第三國之在華貿易權利、若對軍事行動無妨碍、日方已迭决努力開放長江、以供一般航行、在滬所商得之決定、乃日政府此等情緒之具體化、渠信第三國對此、當感滿意、並明瞭日當局對此事刻正盡力進行</p>
<p>外人旅行限制鬆緩</p>
<p>某記者問、質言之、發言人對緩和問題之答覆爲「吾」、然乎、發言人答稱、渠認此非政治事件而係軍事事件、關於外人在長江旅行一點、發言人稱、此乃原則上事件、日當局感覺任何交通、均須受限制、對於航行之限制、今旣撤銷、則長江下游口岸外僑所受限制、亦將鬆緩、開放通航之前、有數事須加注意者、即江陰水柵之移除、與重置江中標記以助航行是已、</p>

<p>本市豆米行業、米號業、經售業、碾米業等七米業團體、爲遵行兩租界當局指示、除已飭各米業行號遵照新訂限價及照常開始營業外、爲澈底調查滬市各米棧米號所存米糧起見、擬督促全體同業將所有米糧向上海民食調節協會辦理登記、該項手續甫由七米業團體往返接洽中、聞日內將召開米業團體聯席會議、屆時除討論上項事件外、並將商决聯合發表宣言、申述目前米市狀况、</p>

<p>自公共租界工部局法租界公董局切實侏護正當米商以維民食之後、豆米行業公會之茶會市塲、昨晨九時開市後、一切交易漸復舊態、各米號因搶米之風已戢、且當局已派探捕保護、故已進米供給鬥市之用、至於各米號難己完全復業、惟入晚即提早收市、各租界邊區各米號營業、僅開小窗交易、蓋預防發生搶米、</p>

<p>常受華方破壞、日軍爲「掃蕩」此項神出鬼沒之「癢蟲」起見、乃在距奔牛北二十八華里鎭澄公路旁之石橋鎭興築一支路、直達迄東三十二華里之常州北鄉</p>
<p>巨鎭魏村</p>
<p>因日軍在魏村築有堅固之碉堡據點、如此路築成、日軍在常州西北鄉之軍事可獲得聯絡、十四日晨九時、日軍築路工程隊正在石橋東三華里處進行工作之際、突遭新四軍挺進縱隊×團×營一部之</p>

<p>本地人張四福、綽號戇大四福、自置大號碼頭船一艘、於本月十二日午後四時、於外灘碼頭裝運洋紗九十八件、白糖一十八件、雜貨五件、總值五六萬金之鉅、搖至浦東其昌棧碼頭、擬缷南通丸輪船、至是晚十一時、該船泊於南通丸旁、尚永開卸之際、不知山何處潛出暴漢三四名、各執盒槍、將船老大小五子以下大小七人、一併細綁後、由暴徒四八、將貨船自動解纜、向下游搖駛而去、</p>
<p>六人被害一人脫逃</p>
<p>約歷二小時後、搖抵浦東東溝港口　暫泊、再候一小時許浦江漲潮、該貨船即被搖進東溝港內、相距港口十里之錢郎中橋後、大小七人、被拖至岸上、關入一暗屋之中、不見天日、約一十餘小時時久、至十四日上午一時許、有人將彼等大小七人喚出、雙手均用繩綁、謂「隊長」喚去問話、黑暗中在墳叢小道押解而行、其中老大小五子一各、乘黑夜機會、用力將綁手之繩掙斷、拔足斜刺而逃、躱入一較遠之破棺中、追者無法尋獲、仍押其餘六人而行、小五子靜伏棺中、俄聞槍聲十餘響、諒六人已同遭殺害、</p>
<p>水巡捕房着手偵緝</p>
<p>小五子在棺中與尸骸同眠三小時之久、直至聞見路旁有賣菜鄕人踵接而過、始敢爬出、乃覓路步行至東溝港口、企圖乘舟返滬、至十四日上午九時、渠立於馬勒船廠浦邊、適遇海關水巡捕房巡船沿浦邊駛過、小五子大呼救命、該巡船乃將小五子帶至捕房、訊得案關刦盜命案、並傳到船主張四福質訊一過、聽候偵緝、</p>
<p>日軍搜查亦無綫索</p>
<p>事被日海軍港務部（在楊樹浦蘭路碼頭）所悉、連日查明案悄、以錢郎中橋係僞「軍」盤踞地、當於前日派兵三十餘名、前往搜查、小五子亦被帶去指證、至目的地後、則見空船一艘、仍泊東溝港中、值價五六萬元之貨物、完全不知去向、被幽禁之屋、因被押時係在黑夜、故此時亦糢糊不能辨、所謂暴漢「隊長」等、一切均無綫索可尋、故仍廢然而返、空船一艘、則未敢派人前往搖回云、</p>

<p>槍殺原因</p>
<p>據華聞社記者調查所得、死者於昨日上午九時二十分、帶領一女孩、自徐家滙乘七路公共汽車至曹家渡忻康里大生賭窟賭博、迨賭至十一時半、輸去一百餘元、乃領其女而去、但身無車資、於是步行歸家、不料行至極司非而路一零三號胡公館附近、突竄出匪徒叫人、將其直貢呢大衣剝下、復欲剝其鼻烟色貓皮袍，、時該男子在命奔跑、四匪徒亦隨後追趕、奔至該里、匪徒遂下毒手云、</p>

<p>轟動一時之第三屆申報杯中美慈善籃球錦標賽、昨晚七時在西靑作第一次會戰、上屆申報盃爲中華隊所保持、本屆美隊實力殊見囂張、大有問鼎之意、中華隊亦俱一時之選、惜乎昨晚竟因李震中陳舉崇沈聿恭三人、拒絕與中華隊合作、無故逃陣、卒致遭美隊毒手、結果六十三比二十七、上半時華隊十七比三十四落後、李等置國際榮譽與慈善事業於不顧、不知是何居心、深堪婉惜、在此非常時期、運動員精神與道德、更應表顯、中華隊昨晚堅苦作戰到底之精神、殊爲觀處所擁護與同情、現選拔委員會爲謀獲取勝利補充實力起見、決另邀若干著名健將加入、藉謀反攻擬於第二場中與美隊作殊死戰、人選明日公佈、至另邀之若干健將、原爲中華隊之柱石、惟爲獎掖後進起見、自願退隱、現中華隊旣遭逢阻碍、爲謀取最後勝利、東山再起、義不容辭也、</p>
<p>興緻彌佳</p>
<p>此决座券、爲維持秩序起見、較上屆　减少　昨日上午、早巳預售一空、足見對中華隊愛護之深、與期望之殷、昨晚西靑球房、麥令軍樂悠揚、更增興緻、中華隊黃裳紅褲、美隊黑裳白褲、軍容甚壯、華隊所穿之球鞋、係正泰信記橡膠廠所特製慨然惠贈中華健兒者、該項回力球鞋、堅固耐穿、質美價廉、七時一刻、勃朗君致簡短演詞後、隊長陳祥龍與柯萊司握手、銀笛隨之吹出、大戰亦於是爆發、</p>
<p>三罰不中</p>
<p>美軍之登塲人物、爲派司哥·鮑杜雪·柯萊司·高許及薩勤脫、淸一色之麥令白隊人物、中華隊因華隊員不合作、衹得以詳龍阿奎大貓任鋒、邦珍國榮充衛、當祥龍與柯萊司騰起後、球即入薩勤脫掌握、未幾、鮑獨雪與高許先後犯規、邦珍祥龍竟三罰未中、球運之逆、似巳顯示中華隊之將遭逢不幸、相持達三分鐘、雙方防守、均異常嚴密、中華隊旣失先開紀錄之機、美隊亦未能如願鵠中、迨卓國榮犯規、派司哥始一罰中的、從此順流而下、一刹那間、美隊已高掛五分、中華呌停、藉商軍略、戰端再揭、薩勤脫又見罰中、六比〇、中華隊仍一無所有、再越一分鐘、中華隊因薩勤脫之犯規、許文奎罰中一分、記分牌七、始見點綴、</p>
<p>球運欠通</p>
<p>神手許文奎、宵來手氣極見不順、極有把握之投射、均差毫釐而失落、幸運之神、似與華隊大開玩笑、直至八比一後、阿奎始再見罰中、但得不償失、大貓偶疏漏、薩勤脫又乘隙兩中、十二比　、中華隊巳落後十二分之多、時間已過十二分鐘、王南羣得脫離薩勤脫之覊絆、述中三元、士士氣爲之一振、惜美軍隨失隨得、適足相抵、此後中華雖曾徼調生力、亦未能應付美軍餓虎般之猛撲、僅祥龍文奎、偶爾命中、迨前半結束、中華十七、美軍卅四、恰差一半、</p>
<p>中興氣象</p>
<p>休息時間、西靑健身隊曾作單槓表演、頗能引人入勝、再戰以後、美軍僅留派司哥一人、餘則盡調新將、中華隊因李等之故意不合作、竟致替補乏員、仍以原來人馬應戰、王南羣少年英俊、作風極似乃兄南珍、卡遜雖具孟賁之勇、竟被此初生之犢、玩弄於股掌之間、一分鐘間、南羣聯珠妙射、百步穿楊、頗使中華隊呈中興氣象、惜乎曇花一現、從此又一蹶不振、美軍於全綫反攻聲中、亭惠爾·派司哥·亨沙惠茲後先建功、比分扶搖直上、四二比廿一、相差愈遠、</p>
<p>終於不救</p>
<p>中華隊雖急以張嘉夔調出大貓、不久又令國雄大貓重入、不但無補戰局、雖阿奎一擲中的、但門戶洞開、休士·卡遜·亨沙惠茲、如臨無人之境、中華隊從此不可爲矣、此後中華隊曾一度活躍、南羣籃下托入、大貓兩罰兩中、已屬迥光反照、無補於事、李祖德會調出阿奎、反予美軍以三次罰球機會、最後亨沙惠茲之一射、甫落籃圈、鐘聲亦隨之鏜然大鳴、中華隊遂不幸以二十七對六十三首遭挫折、幸此後尚有兩戰、亡羊補牢、猶爲未晚也、</p>

<p>劇情：這是一幕活劇，在現在生活的高壓下演出了，夠悲慘的，因爲受不了經濟的壓迫，食糧的在漲，一家五口服生鴉片自殺。　（見十四日本報）</p>
<p>地點：上海楊樹浦路長安里　三十九號亭子間內。</p>
<p>時間：民國二十八年十二月十三日下午。</p>
<p>人物：主角業紅帮成衣匠之李阿新，其妻，及其二子一女，自四歲至十四歲不等。</p>
<p>佈景：破亭子間一角，桌上置茶杯數隻，內盛生鴉片水，破椅數柄。</p>
<p>（幕啟時，一家五口共圍桌旁，妻抱幼子於懷。）</p>
<p>李：（面色鐵靑）米珠薪桂，以後生活如何過聯下去！（手持茶杯。顫抖。）孩子…們</p>
<p>大家…來…渴咖啡茶…。</p>
<p>妻：（淚下）是的，孩子們，可憐三天沒…吃了。來渴些咖啡吧！</p>
<p>幼子：（自其母懷中探出小手）媽！給我喝些嗎！</p>
<p>女：（自椅中跳起）我要先喝！（向其母）先給我喝吧！媽！弟弟吃過奶呢，我連奶都沒有吃呢！</p>
<p>李：全有得喝，今天反正同往常兩樣，少不了誰，而且誰愛喝，我就愛誰…</p>
<p>（幼子與女以生鴉片爲咖啡互相爭食，長子分得一杯，李與其妻，分配呑服，已只存少許服之，恐毒力不足，以手蘸桌上餘汁作入口狀。）</p>
<p>長子：（持杯停喝）爸！什麼咖啡是苦的呢！</p>
<p>李：）怒，繼又作極悲慘貌。）你們沒有喝過咖啡呢！快喝！喝下去就永遠不會餓了！</p>
<p>妻：是的，乖兒子，快喝！喝了就不冷不餓了！乖兒子，快喝吧！</p>
<p>（長子一口氣作喝盡狀）</p>
<p>（台上靜默少許）</p>
<p>長子：（覺腹痛）媽！爲什麼喝了咖啡，會肚痛呢？</p>
<p>李：（自椅中躍起，大聲）你多嘴，一會兒就不痛的！</p>
<p>長子：（退後，低聲向其妹）妹妹，你也覺得痛嗎？</p>
<p>（妹點頭示意）</p>
<p>（幕後突加緊張音響，羣孩覺腹痛如絞，捧腹亂跳，地上打滾。慘呌。）</p>
<p>李：（面色泛白，淚下如雨）太傷心了，太傷心了，我們毒死親生的兒子了！</p>
<p>妻：（放聲大哭）</p>

<p>第十九回　看花賞月活動成家　種玉孕珠娠有術</p>
<p>且說近年來因爲世界漸已大同，一切禮俗，中國也和歐美兩洲的差不多起來了。不過歐美各國，不是一成不變的，也時時在改革。總之這全繫於科學的發明，凡是科學上有一個大發明，一切事物，便隨之而有一個大變革。單說婚禮，從前代到如今，也變革了許多了。西洋人的結婚，向來都在敎堂裏，由牧師證婚。現在有許多國家，並不必要牧師證婚，只到婚姻局去註了册，便算數了。惟有幾個信敎的信徒，仍舊由牧師證婚。至於中國，在從前信奉基督敎的，也是少數。不過人民有信敎自由，國家並不予以制裁，偶也有在敎堂結婚的，大多數却是借一個禮堂，請一個證婚人，自由結婚。在戰前也有盛行一種集團結婚的，這方法很好。因爲東方人喜歡禮式，而中國一向是個禮敎之邦，單講婚禮，便可以成一部專書，不是研究古禮的人，還記得有「士昏禮　章嗎？集團結婚，是取一種簡省制度，也是敎民以儉的法測。民間結婚往往請客的請客，送禮者送禮，徒多糜費。有錢的不必說，他們自然儘管可以排塲。沒有錢的也要擺這個空塲而，甚而至於借了債，爲兒女輩完婚，到了後來，這個債永遠還不淸的也有。集團結婚不過花幾十塊錢就完了，也舉行了結婚儀式，不用請客，不用送禮，自然簡便得多。所以直到如今，這集團結婚，中國有許多地方還通行着，大概是那種工業繁盛的區域，要算最多了。此外，他們的婚姻，要佈告給人知道的，就在本地報紙的婚姻布告欄，登一小行告白，說是某人已與某人結婚就是了。再要講到簡便，就在婚姻局登記了，也未始不算正式夫婦。現在要說林建成與金澹雲結婚，不免有些鋪張揚厲，他們　樣要請客，還在上海借了最大的萬國大旅館。吃喜酒的不獨是有林建成的朋友，金澹雲的姊妹，却還有蘇理雅太太所認識有關係的人。不獨是有中國的親戚朋友，而且還有許多外國先生們，太太們，小姐們。不但是蘇理雅太太所認識有關係的人，便是金澹雲自己，所認得的外國朋友，也不在少數呀。（二一七）</p>

<p>魚從熱帶山遙路遠地運到上海來，加上現在正是外貨飛漲的時候，賣什麼兩三百元一對，講起來本不能算貴，可是牠到我們溫帶來，曾舊要過牠的舊生活，必定要借重什麼電視馬達之類來輸暖，養魚先生們的電費賬上又加許多，因爲不如此，牠們就要客死異鄉，「魚且如此，人何以堪！」</p>
<p>難胞究竟不是北極的白熊，加上前幾天，老天不做美，朔風凛冽，最慘的就是每天報上都要看到難胞三十四十的死耗！唉！人命難道不及魚命嗎？</p>

<p>— 權</p>
<p>近日市上米價的飛漲，形成了中下階級極大的恐慌，以及整個社會的動蕩。試觀數日以內，怠工者接踵而起，而全市四五百萬居民亦無不極感焦慮也。雖幸經工部局多方設法，然此僅爲治標之法，米價之抑低，實有賴乎來源之疏通，與乎脫離奸商之覊絆。例如現在蕪湖之米，每石僅售十五元；常熟之米，每石僅售廿二元；而松江等地，亦僅售廿五元而已。凡此諸地，皆近在咫尺，雖加運輸之費，每石卅元亦已儘够，但現工部局之限價，亦達四十五元。由此觀之，米價之高，實由於奸商之囤，故即來日來源疏通，米市亦時有壟斷之虞。因此要使上海整個米市安定，必須有賴羣策羣力，努力消費合作社的完成。這非但爲全市市民謀米糧，並且可以給奸商一個嚴重的打擊。敝人謹揣擬簡章並進行辦法數則，惟尚望全市各界一致遵行，則市民當沾恩不淺也。</p>
<p>（一）資本　本合作社資本，皆由會員分股任之。開辦資本預定爲六萬元（的二千石米之費）。</p>
<p>（二）會員　本合作社分基本會員與普通會員二種。基本會員須繳股費一千元，普通會員須繳股費廿元。本會共有基本股廿股，普通股二千股。並得臨時增加之。</p>
<p>（三）米源　本合作社米糧，一部分係洋米，一部分係國米，由本社派員採購並混合後發售之。</p>
<p>（四）會員權利　基本股員得出席本社各項行政會議，並有選舉權與被選舉權。普通股得享受購米上之便利。</p>
<p>（五）本社米糧之售價　本社初創時米價應較市價低五分之一至十分之一，一方面使米市不致降落遽速。一方面亦可募集更大之基金，至相當時期後，本社售價得按市價出售。</p>
<p>（六）社員購米之步驟　社員入社時須另繳調查表一紙，書明家庭人口實數與需食糧數。並須由服務機關證明之，或由本社調查之。惟購米之數量不依股數作比例，而依家庭所需爲凖。</p>
<p>（七）本社之經濟　本社經濟，請本市會計師公會派員負責審查之，經濟絕對公開，如有贏餘按年依股數分派之。如於創辦時有周轉不靈之時，則請全市各公司廠家義務協助之。</p>
<p>（八）本社行政組織本社由基本社員及普通社員代表若干人，組織執行會議，議決本社一切進行事項，惟主席須由基本社員任之。</p>
<p>本社社章數則，已如上述。其中最困難者，厥爲開辦時之採貨，與本社發展後之管理也。凡此皆需大批之人才，故非全市各界一致動員不可。惟本人所擬之章，因陋就簡，希各界熱心人士一面有以指正，一面竭力推行。先就食米問題解決，再從衣食住行各方面着手，庶幾全市居民，共沾福利，奸滑之徒，絕跡於市。記得世界大戰時英國合作事業之普遍發展，奠定了協的國戰勝的基礎，我們試翻開合作社的歷史來，就知道我們是必有大裨益於民衆社會的。　一二·一五·</p>

<p>電影藝術，正和文學美術一樣，有它種種不同的作風。下面是美國論壇報的特稿，今摘譯於后：</p>
<p>美國　在金圓主義的環境下，資本主義極度的澎漲，國民的習性傾向於肉的享樂。電影是偏於有趣的，輕快的，有如爵士音樂的特質，資本，技術人材都較他國充足。</p>
<p>英國　這第八藝術中，很能表現出他們的國民性。裏面充滿了嚴肅的紳士態度。在技巧方面遠不及美國，每每令人看了感覺沈悶乏趣。但却很台一般不列顚人民的胃口。</p>
<p>德國　全世界上能够跟美國比比的只有德國，充份地運用了他們科學上的技巧和藝術的特長。不過太注重技巧，露出了不自然的樣子，並且多帶沈重的特質，缺少美國人的輕妙。</p>
<p>俄國　電影是宣傳的工具，蘇俄當局便利用牠去作宣傳的利器。色彩太濃，似少趣味。</p>

<h3 id="c109">開口跳人才論 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>「開口跳」俗稱武丑。武丑一行在北方，早年以張黑王捨子（即王長林）爲此中冠，張黑善演「盜銀壺」「三岔口」一類戲，愚未嘗見。長林則以演「九龍盃」「連環套」等戲負譽歌壇。十五年前，愚在故都，會屢觀長林劇，時長林與楊小樓余叔岩合作，出演於香廠新明大戲院，雖年齡已高，但老當益壯，精神健旺，是故照樣能演開口跳戲；小樓演「速環套」戲中之朱光祖，「惡虎村」戲中之王棟，仍由長林扮演，惟長林以年紀關係，摔打翻跌已談不到，在台上所見，不過神情功架和乾腌俐落之白口而已。如小樓演「連環套」，長林之朱光祖，在前幾塲多係文塲，無關緊要，後段盜鈎，新明台上雖仍擺兩張桌子，但王老頭兒那裏還能拿個大頂，翻個斛斗，不過是「賣羊三千」，等到要上桌子的時候，由兩個檢塲人把他攙了上去，做完身段之後，再把他攙了下來，雖狀滑稽，但北方人看戲愛看老古董，只要王長林漏這齣戲，依然賣座。其實，一半也是「物以稀爲貴」的緣故，當時開口跳的人才，比現在還少，除了這位王老先生以外，只有一個傅小山，鋒芒畢露。</p>
<p>傅小山是票友出身，拜王長林爲師，雖然嗓子，沒有他師傅那樣宏亮，可是功架神情，都不錯，而且武工有獨到之處，摔打翻跌，無一不精。從民國十三年到二十三年，這十年中，北方開口跳人才，只有小山一個人最紅，差不多的武生，都邀他爲配，小山的好戲，是「戰宛城」的胡車，「霸王莊」的朱光祖，「惡虎村」的黃一刀，「連環套」的朱光祖，可惜此人愛好杯中物，竟於二十三年秋間，病死故都。</p>
<p>與傳小山同一時期工武丑的，還有富速成出身的陸喜才，斌慶社出身的范斌祿劉斌升，（久隨李萬春在北方有觔斗大王之號）不過這些人，都未能走紅。小山故後，繼起者有葉盛章王福山，盛章的武工，比當年的王長林傳小山都好，至於唸白做表，實遜於王傳。王福山是長林的哲嗣，曾得長林親授，藝頗不弱，但武工不及盛章，復不能饗堂，致不如盛章之走紅，惟福山極獲楊小樓之賞識，小樓晚年，不肯邀盛章配戲，始終與福山合作，實別具雙眼也。</p>
<p>最近兩年，北方產生兩個開口跳人才，即將出演黃金之艾世菊，與現方在更新登台之殷金振是也，世菊文武兼工，但演開口跳戲並不遜於演文丑戲，前决觀其演「時遷偷鷄」「黃一刀」等戲，頗多可取。殷金振爲戲曲學校高材生，專工武丑，頗具根基，翻跌工夫，在艾世菊之上，唸白做表則不及世菊，經騐稍差，但亦可造之才也。</p>

By noon, the Japanese forces were unable to withstand the assault and collapsed, retreating. Dagao Fengao was immediately recaptured. The vanguard of the Chinese army on the Yongbin Road completely annihilated the Japanese forces at Qitang this afternoon. The remaining Japanese forces at Batang are currently being encircled and annihilated. Forty-plus vehicles and several hundred Japanese troops at Wutang and Liutang are in a state of extreme panic, as all roads to Nanning have been destroyed by the Chinese army, preventing their escape.

<p>Guilin: After recovering Jiutang, the Southern Route Chinese Army completed the encirclement of Batangxu at 2:00 PM today. They began to annihilate the main force of the Japanese Imamura Division entrenched within the market town.

The fierce battle continued into the evening, with the Japanese suffering nearly a thousand casualties and their situation becoming untenable. It is now rumored here that the market town has been captured. The munitions and supplies captured by the Chinese army at Kunlun Pass and Jiutang are piled up like mountains. The Japanese abandoned corpses are scattered all over the mountains and fields. Since the outbreak of the war on the Southern Route, this victory is the most significant achieved by the Chinese army. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Southern Guangxi: At noon on the 18th, the Chinese army cleared the Japanese forces south of Kunlun Pass and, after capturing Jiutang, searched for remaining Japanese soldiers in the vicinity that afternoon, clearing the battlefield and taking inventory of the spoils of war.

<p>Chongqing: Local authorities announced today that on Sunday, the Chinese army had launched an offensive in the Nanning area and, after capturing several strategically important high grounds near Kunlun Pass at night, continued to advance along the road to Nanning yesterday morning. The Chinese army's advance began with a fierce bombardment by artillery, followed by a vigorous assault on the Japanese positions by infantry. Both flanks also engaged in flanking maneuvers. Although Japanese aircraft were extremely active, using bombs and machine guns to halt the Chinese army's advance, the Chinese army did not retreat in the slightest and ultimately recaptured the strategic Kunlun Pass. Batang Village, south of the pass, was also recovered. A certain high-ranking commander personally directed the operation from the front lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army and capturing a large number of weapons and ammunition.

<p>Yichang: The Japanese have suffered heavy losses in Central Hubei in recent days. Although they have repeatedly sent reinforcements, they are still unable to reverse their decline. As a result, the Japanese have resorted to using tear gas and sneeze gas, and in the Xiangjiawan area, they used aircraft and tanks to cover a fierce counterattack by over 2,000 Japanese soldiers. After the Chinese forces bravely fought back, they completely repelled the Japanese army after half a day of fierce fighting. In the Gongyi Chang area, over 3,000 Japanese soldiers relied on fortifications and engaged in fierce combat with the Chinese for two days and nights.

<h3 id="e10">Naval Battle in the South Atlantic and the Security of the Americas <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The British cruiser Ajax, together with two other cruisers, Achilles and Exeter, defeated the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the South Atlantic. The German ship escaped into the port of Montevideo, Uruguay, a South American country, for repairs, and eventually scuttled itself. Although this was a small-scale naval engagement, it cannot be considered important in terms of the war itself, and cannot be compared with the Battle of Jutland, a major naval battle between Britain and Germany in the North Sea in 1916. Moreover, this Anglo-German naval battle did not have a major impact on the war in Europe. At most, it only exposed that German pocket battleships were not as elite as the Germans boasted. Originally, the hull of the pocket battleship was welded together, not riveted. Its "Diesel" engine allows it to reach a speed of 26 knots per hour, and its cylinders are sufficient to maintain a range of 10,000 miles at a speed of 10 knots per hour. Its armament includes six 11-inch guns. In theory, warships below the level of British battleships are not its opponents, because the guns on British cruisers do not exceed 8 inches in caliber. According to German estimates, it would take at least six cruisers to defeat a German pocket battleship. Now, three British cruisers have defeated the Admiral Spee, causing many deaths. In terms of this incident, the strength of the German Navy is clearly unable to compare with that of Britain. Therefore, the Anglo-German naval battle in the South Atlantic only has this one point in terms of its significance in the war. In other respects, however, the relationship is quite complex. We know that the location of this Anglo-German naval battle was in the South Atlantic, close to the Americas, and as a result of the battle, the German warship fled to the port of Uruguay, a neutral country. Regardless of the size of the war, the fluctuations of the war have invaded the paradise of the Americas. Not only that, but according to the provisions of international law, warships of belligerent countries can only stay for 72 hours. Otherwise, they must be detained until the end of the war before they can withdraw. Therefore, if the German pocket battleship Admiral Spee wanted to avoid being detained, it could only risk escape. However, the British side already had the 10,000-ton cruiser Cumberland and the 7,000-ton cruiser Achilles, the battleships Renown and Barham, the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the French battleship Dunkerque patrolling nearby waters, waiting for the Admiral Spee to break out and capture it. For this reason, Admiral Spee had no choice but to scuttle itself. A second naval battle will not happen. U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated that even if a second naval battle occurred, it could only be regarded as a continuation of the first naval battle, and therefore could not constitute a second violation of the neutral zone. However, the plan proposed at the last Panama Conference to delineate a 300-mile zone off the coast of the Americas as a security zone has long been dispelled by this Anglo-German naval battle. A British government foreign affairs spokesperson said: The willingness of the American countries to maintain peace on the American continent is understood and respected by Britain. Britain is willing to respect this willingness, but it still prioritizes military strategy and operations and takes diplomatic considerations as secondary. If the fleets of the American countries can maintain the neutrality of this security zone and make it respected by all belligerent countries, Britain has no objections. Otherwise, it will only facilitate German submarines and warships to conduct pirate-style warfare, which Britain cannot sit idly by. In short, Britain has not yet recognized the security zone and has stated that it reserves all rights. What it recognizes is only the three-mile territorial sea. This frankly explains that the only issue Britain is paying attention to is its strategic convenience, and all other issues are decisive. This means that there is no so-called security zone even in the South American ocean, which also means that even on the American continent, it is fundamentally impossible to stay out of the war. Those American isolationists, such as Senator Clark, believe that the fear of some people in the United States about a country invading U.S. territory is the most ridiculous fantasy. The United States needs a huge navy of three to one to attack a country, and a country needs a navy of three to one to invade the United States. This is purely based on the experience of the last war, and forgets that as a result of the recent development of aviation and transportation, the spatial limitations have become a very unimportant obstacle. We hope that he will learn a factual lesson from this naval engagement in the South Atlantic and realize that the United States cannot close its doors and make money from war and never be threatened by other countries.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Churchill's Report: Heavy Losses for the German Navy; Spee's Failure to Fight is Not Honorable; British Ship's Officers and Men Were Consistently Brave and Good at Fighting <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>London: British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill recently reported to the House of Commons on the recent naval battle, paying particular attention to the situation of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Spee." He said that the ship had been attacking merchant ships of various countries in the South Atlantic for several weeks. Now that it has destroyed itself, merchant ships of various countries can at least temporarily enjoy maritime freedom. When the ship fought three British cruisers on the 13th of this month, although its armor was thicker and its guns had a longer range, it eventually retreated to a neutral port. As far as the ship was concerned, there were only two options at the time: one was to be detained by the Uruguayan government, and the other was to leave the port of Montevideo and fight the British ship, as our country's auxiliary cruiser Rawalpindi had done before. In our opinion, the second option was the most honorable. However, the ship did not do this. Its departure from the neutral port was not in preparation for battle, but to scuttle itself. The purpose of this is particularly incomprehensible. Moreover, the ship knew at the time that the British battleship Renown and the aircraft carrier Ark Royal were refueling in the capital of Brazil, about 1,000 miles away. The ships surrounding it outside the coast of Uruguay were the cruisers Ajax and Achilles, equipped with 6-inch guns, which were the two ships that had fought it once before. In addition, there was the cruiser Cumberland, equipped with 8-inch guns, which replaced the damaged Exeter. It can be seen that our side did not use greater force to put pressure on it. As for the situation of the naval battle on the 13th of this month, our losses were also not small. At this time, it is okay to speak frankly. The cruiser Ajax had four gun turrets, two of which had been destroyed by enemy fire. The enemy ship also fired 40 to 50 shots at our cruiser Exeter, most of which weighed far more than those fired by our ship. This ship of our country had six 8-inch guns, three of which had been destroyed. The total number of officers and men killed and injured on the ship was about 100, of which the number of martyrs was greater than the number of injured. However, after being damaged, it still sailed to outside the port of Montevideo to monitor the German ship Admiral Spee's departure and prepared to fight the enemy ship again until the Cumberland arrived before withdrawing from the battle line. The bravery and skill of the officers and men of our navy can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of the record of our country's submarines, it has achieved great success in the past week. Our submarines never attack neutral ships, nor do they threaten small fishing boats. Their sphere of activity is mainly the mine area and its strong defense money in the German naval base of Heligoland Island. Therefore, few German warships moored in the port dare to cross the thunder pond. Our country's submarine Salmon encountered the German mail ship Bremen last week. It could have been sunk at the time, but it did not fire torpedoes at it because it complied with international regulations. The submarine then used one torpedo to hit an enemy 6,000-ton cruiser, and then used two torpedoes to hit another enemy cruiser. Although these two enemy ships may still be able to sail back to their country's base, in any case, it will be difficult for them to operate normally in the next few months. In addition, our country's submarine Ursula sank an enemy cruiser of the Koln class at the mouth of the Elbe River in Germany on the 14th of this month. It can be seen that in the past week, the strength of the enemy cruiser fleet has lost a lot.</p>
<p>As for the German naval aircraft, they have recently stepped up their attacks on fishing boats and unarmed merchant ships of various countries. Even an Italian ship was bombed off the coast of Britain. Fortunately, the enemy aircraft were unable to do what they wanted. Although there were as many as 24 ships of various countries bombed by them, only six of them were hit. In short, Britain's entire shipping industry has not been interrupted in the slightest due to the enemy's crazy actions. The First Division of the Canadian Federation's Expeditionary Force has crossed the ocean under the escort of our country's warships and arrived safely at a certain port in our country yesterday, which is clear proof of this. It is specially reported here that the officers and men of the division had stepped up their training in the country before being transferred to the French front to assist in the battle.

<h3 id="e12">British Submarine Commander Reports Heavy Damage to Two German Warships; One Certainly Sunk to the Bottom of the Sea; Respected Public Law, Did Not Bomb the "Bremen" <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty recently issued a communique stating that the British submarine "Salmon" did not capture the German large passenger ship "Bremen" on the 12th of this month due to adherence to international public law. However, the following day, it used torpedoes to hit two German warships. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>London: The British Admiralty announced today that a British submarine had independently attacked one German pocket battleship, two battlecruisers, and three cruisers. It stated that when the submarine surfaced for reconnaissance, it saw the German ship "Bremen," which had previously been hiding in Murmansk, Soviet Union, speeding towards a certain German port. It was within the submarine's torpedo range. If the submarine wanted to attack, it would certainly not let it escape. However, the commander had orders from the Admiralty that maritime warfare must comply with international public law. Despite knowing that German aircraft were nearby, the submarine still surfaced and, in broad daylight, sent a signal to "stop immediately." The "Bremen" ignored it. The British commander then ordered the loading of ammunition to fire a shot across the "Bremen's" bow as a warning, as an attack without such a warning would be illegal. Even at this point, the submarine was still trying to ensure the safety of the German crew, even though ensuring their safety was impossible under the circumstances. Before the warning shot could be fired, German aircraft appeared in the sky, forcing the British submarine to submerge to avoid them. Although it was still possible to launch torpedoes to destroy the "Bremen," international public law could not be ignored, and the British submarine allowed the "Bremen" to sail away safely. This is the accurate account of the British submarine's encounter with the "Bremen." The news released by German radio is completely inconsistent with the facts. Less than 24 hours after the "Bremen" sailed away, the submarine spotted the German battlecruisers "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau," one pocket battleship, and three cruisers in the same area. Of these three cruisers, one was the new ship "Hipper," and another was the new ship "Blücher," both equipped with eight-inch guns. The third was the "Leipzig." Because they were far away, the British submarine initially thought it could do nothing but report to its country. However, the German cruisers suddenly changed direction and sailed into the submarine's torpedo range, giving the British submarine a chance to attack. The British commander then fired six torpedoes in various directions within a few minutes. The submarine could easily have fired all its torpedoes at one ship to sink it, but firing them in different directions was because the commander hoped to destroy more than one enemy ship. The first torpedo hit the "Leipzig" (6,000 tons). A minute later, two loud explosions were heard, indicating that two more torpedoes had hit. The other three torpedoes passed between the enemy ships without hitting them. The fleet battle that the British Navy had hoped for did not occur, which was due to poor visibility, not the submarine's fault. After being searched for by enemy ships for two hours, the submarine finally returned to the location where the German cruisers had been torpedoed in the dark. There, it found a large oil slick covering four square miles, indicating that in addition to the "Leipzig," another German heavy cruiser had been severely damaged. At least one of these two ships must have failed to return to a German port. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Naval officials here declared that the news, transmitted by the British news agency, that a German "Köln"-class cruiser was sunk by the British submarine "Ursula" on the 14th of this month at the mouth of the Elbe River, has no basis. Or, the torpedo fired by the British submarine exploded underwater near the German cruiser, but the damage from this explosion was minimal. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>London: Regarding the scuttling of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," it is pointed out here today that this is a shameful act that violates the traditional spirit of the navy. Examples of this traditional spirit include the famous battle in 1591 where Sir Richard Grenville, commander of the English ship "Revenge," fought alone against 53 Spanish warships off Flores Island in the Azores, and the Battle of Coronel in 1914, where Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the British Navy risked fighting against a superior German fleet. More recently, there was the heroic act of the Spanish Republican destroyer "José Luis Díez," which, after undergoing repairs in Gibraltar during the Spanish Civil War, sailed out to confront the powerful Nationalist fleet, but never destroyed itself. The scuttling of the "Graf Spee" indicates that Germany not only lacks fighting spirit but also lacks confidence in ultimate victory. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>London: The British Air Force issued a communique last night stating that a squadron of British Air Force bombers flew to the Heligoland Bight area of the North Sea (a German naval base) for reconnaissance, intending to attack any enemy ships found at sea. However, the British bombers did not encounter any enemy ships but instead encountered a strong German fighter squadron, resulting in a fierce battle. Twelve "Messerschmitt" German planes were shot down, but seven British bombers did not return to base.</p>
<p>Responsible sources stated that, considering the strong resistance encountered by the British planes, it is clear that the German High Command now prioritizes preserving its dwindling fleet. The enemy has retreated its navy during wartime, leaving its fighter planes to fight against the British planes. In the fierce air battle, the skillful tactics and determination of the British squadron leaders and aircrew, as well as the efficiency of the British planes' armament, are clearly demonstrated by the significant losses suffered by the Germans. The public generally regards the German version of the battle as an absurd attempt aimed only at reducing the prestige they have lost at sea and in the air in the past few days. A communique issued by the Air Ministry also stated that German losses accounted for half of the planes involved in the battle. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

After the German planes arrived, they immediately attacked the British planes, shooting down several. The other British planes still attempted to invade the German coast, but without success. The fierce battle lasted two hours. A total of thirty-four British planes were shot down. After the German victory, the planes safely returned to their airfields. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>

According to reports from various sources, twenty-four British planes were shot down, and the extreme losses expected by the British planes during their return journey have not yet been accounted for. Several wrecks of British planes have already drifted to German islands. The pilots of two British planes have been captured. The British bombers rarely penetrated Wilhelmshaven and were subjected to intense fire from anti-aircraft guns, failing to drop their bombs. Two German planes crashed, but the pilots safely escaped by parachute. The German fighter planes belong to the "Schumacher Squadron" of "Messerschmitt 109s," the famous unit that fought against twenty British planes on the 14th of this month and shot down ten British planes."

<h3 id="e23">German Air Fleets Attack the British East Coast; Several Ships Sunk <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty recently issued a message stating that German air fleets have repeatedly flown to the North Sea skies of our country yesterday, attacking merchant ships and fishing boats of our country and neutral countries. The first incident occurred yesterday morning. Several German planes attacked the gasoline ship "Trinity," the fishing boat "Neogus," the "Ben Clarie," and the "Craig Lee." The "Trinity" and "Neogus" were hit and sunk. The German planes also used machine guns to strafe the "Craig Lee," and two crew members were seriously injured. When our country's planes arrived, the German planes did not engage and fled without a trace. Afterwards, our country's coastal patrol planes spotted a lifeboat at sea, carrying ten crew members from the "Neogus," and immediately instructed a fishing boat to sail to the rescue. The second German air raid occurred yesterday afternoon, and their bombing targets were our country's gasoline ship "Tuscan Star," the fishing boat "Tavistock," the "Shielden," the "Benate," the "Taormina," and the Italian steamer "Corda." The radio operator's assistant on the "Tuscan Star" was killed by shrapnel. The German planes also used machine guns to strafe the ship afterwards, but fortunately, there were no other casualties. As night fell, our planes arrived, and the German planes fled into the clouds. According to private sources, the British fishing boats "Ivelina" and "Seagiefram" have been missing for some time and are likely to have been sunk by German planes. In addition, three other fishing boats, namely, the "Elinor White," the "Companion Angus," and the "Pearl," were also attacked by German planes. The "Pearl" has already sunk, but all crew members have been rescued. The "Elinor White" was damaged and has been towed to a certain British port. One crew member of the "Companion Angus" was killed and another injured by machine-gun fire from German planes. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Officials here stated that the rumors that German military aircraft bombed neutral ships should be clarified. In reality, German planes did not bomb neutral ships, except for those escorted by British warships. Recently, the German Air Force bombed ships off the British coast, including one British escort ship and one ship patrolling the coast, as well as ships hired for combat. Two warships were bombed and sunk, and three other warships were severely damaged. Many crew members abandoned ship and fled. When German bombers appeared in British airspace, the British ships showed signs of panic. After the German planes dropped the first bomb, the British ships scattered in all directions. German pilots, looking down from high altitude, saw British warships and coastal batteries firing, but because the German planes were circling at high altitude, they were beyond the range of the artillery shells and escaped safely.

<p>Tokyo - Regarding Nomura's actions to open the Yangtze River to adjust U.S.-Japan relations, Japanese newspapers have criticized it. "Kokumin Shimbun" argued that if this proposal still cannot adjust U.S.-Japan relations, Nomura should resign to apologize to the nation. It also stated that if Japan's actions still cannot ease U.S.-Japan relations, an anti-American sentiment in Japan will surge, and the U.S. must bear full responsibility for the occurrence of this anti-American movement. "Hochi Shimbun" claimed that if the U.S. does not move closer to Japan in response to this gesture, it will undermine international trust and damage Japan.

<p>Chongqing - Correspondents stationed in Chongqing from Havas, Associated Press, German News Agency, The New York Times, Reuters, TASS, Haitong News Agency, Associated Press, etc., held a public banquet for Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department at the auditorium of the Executive Yuan at 7:00 PM on the 18th, and invited Vice Ministers Pan Gongzhan and Dong Xianguang, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhu Shiming, President of the Central News Agency Xiao Tongzi, Chargé d'affaires Peck of the U.S. Embassy, Chargé d'affaires De San of the Belgian Embassy, Counselor Bitted of the German Embassy, Secretary Denisov of the Soviet Embassy, and Balisniekov to accompany them. More than eighty guests and hosts attended. During the banquet, Stuart, Special Correspondent of the Associated Press, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the hosts, followed by Minister Wang delivering a speech in reply. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed at 9:00 PM. The main points of Minister Wang's reply are as follows: In the past, I have lacked experience in journalism and propaganda work. I am deeply grateful for the invitation from you all today. I feel that in China's persistent struggle today, foreign reporters in China have a very important mission. Since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan last year, China and its friendly European and American countries have almost lost direct contact. It is difficult to directly convey China's resistance and construction efforts to the people of those friendly countries. Coupled with the vigorous propaganda of the Japanese and the outbreak of the European War, news of China's resistance has not been able to get full attention or understanding from friendly countries. In this situation, the unfavorable position in which China finds itself is very obvious. I hope that foreign reporters stationed in China will transmit news of China's resistance and national construction to their home countries as much as possible, so that people of all countries can have a full understanding of the overall situation in the Far East and maintain full attention, so as not to be swayed by the Japanese side's false propaganda. However, this proposal of mine does not mean that you should embellish the news you transmit on my behalf. What I expect from you is to accurately and regularly report on the situation of China's resistance, because the threat that China is currently facing not only endangers China's national lifeline, but also shakes the foundation of world peace. Only in this way must we constantly report its true situation and detailed information to people all over the world. I have a basic belief in propaganda work, that a propaganda agency should not be a tool for creating rumors or instigating trouble, but should be a tool that facilitates the transmission of all truths, and at the same time, it should be a strong barrier to defend against all false propaganda. In this sense, your work is also propaganda work. I would like to share the above-mentioned reasons with you. China's current stage of struggle is indeed an important page in modern world history. Everyone here tonight is an eyewitness to this important historical fact, and each of you bears a major responsibility for recording, disseminating, and elucidating it. Therefore, I have very high expectations for you. (Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese refugees who fled from Bangkok yesterday, overseas Chinese residing in Thailand (Siam) are living in terror, similar to what Jews in Germany are experiencing. Most Chinese merchants and intellectuals have fled Thailand, and the Chinese government is trying to accommodate them. Refugees claimed that Chinese banks, yarn factories, shops, schools, and newspapers in Thailand have been closed by the Thai government. It is said that Thailand harbors territorial ambitions towards British, French, and Chinese territories in southern Asia. Refugees believe that Thailand's anti-China policy is instigated by Japan and due to Thailand's implementation of military dictatorship. In fact, all government agencies in Bangkok have Japanese advisors, and it is rumored that Japan and Thailand plan to divide Southeast Asia equally. The anti-China movement reached its peak in July, when more than 2,000 overseas Chinese were detained by the Thai government. The arrest of overseas Chinese was due to the overseas Chinese remitting one million yuan in legal tender to the government to replenish the war treasury. The Thai government made systematic arrests based on the list of donors. Some of the arrested overseas Chinese were sent back to China, some were released and fled, and others are still in detention. According to refugees, the Thai government opposes remittances abroad, as the military has adopted the slogan "Everything belongs to Thailand." The Thai military feels that all military donations in Thailand should be used to expand the Thai military and should not be remitted to the National Revolutionary Army. Of the seven Chinese newspapers in Bangkok, six were closed by Thailand, and the editor of the seventh was assassinated in the summer. The only Chinese newspaper published in Bangkok, "Thailand Jingbao," is edited by the Japanese. Refugees claimed that Thailand harbors territorial ambitions and plans to seize Shan State, Cambodia, and a portion of British Burma, as well as the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan in China, where Thai people residing in these areas total 14 million, equal to the number of people in Thailand itself.

The soldiers and civilians of other counties have intensified their preparations for resistance and defense. Therefore, everything has entered a state of war. The situation in various aspects is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese Troops Repeatedly Attempted to Land in Beihai. After the Japanese troops attacked Yining, they feared that their sea route would be cut off, leading to the danger of annihilation. Therefore, they tried their best to consolidate their strongholds in Qinzhou and Fangcheng, while trying to prevent the Chinese army from flanking them from Lianjiang, and divided their forces to invade the territory of Lingshan and Hepu counties. Therefore, the situation in Beihai became increasingly tense, rumors were rampant, and it was repeatedly reported that the Japanese troops had landed here. After investigation, it was found to be untrue. According to a dispatch from Beihai, it is said that on the evening of the 27th of last month, Japanese troops did attempt to land. The incident occurred at about 7 o'clock that evening, when two Japanese warships on the Beihai South Ring Sea suddenly moved to anchor off Guantouling, and then three more arrived. At about 8 o'clock, six speedboats were launched, patrolling the area around Guantouling, Dijiao, and Longwangyan, and opening fire with machine guns. Then, forty or fifty Japanese soldiers attempted to land on Longshan Rock by boat. The Chinese garrison had been prepared for a long time. When they approached, they were met with a fierce attack. The Japanese soldiers, fearing annihilation, quickly fled by boat. Afterwards, the Chinese army captured five suspicious men on the shore, who were interrogated by the headquarters. Unexpectedly, at about 1 o'clock that night, sporadic gunshots were suddenly heard in the Jiufentian area near Qianting. Residents, unaware of the situation, thought that the Japanese troops had landed again, and fled in droves, in a state of extreme panic. Later, when they saw that there was no other reason, and learned that it was caused by bandits plotting a robbery, the people's hearts began to stabilize, but they had already suffered a great scare. The next day, the Beihai radio station experienced a blockage in communication due to damage to the generator, which caused much speculation in the outside world. After the repair and report, the public was relieved. As of the 1st of this month, Beihai was still peaceful, and there was no major movement of Japanese warships on the sea. Japanese aircraft often came and went to invade. However, the residents and merchants of Beihai had long been ordered to evacuate, and the population was sparse, making it difficult for Japanese aircraft to wreak havoc. The city has now become a deserted city, and all commercial activities have been suspended. Although Taikoo ships occasionally load and unload passengers and goods, they leave immediately after a brief stop.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bombarded Qinzhou and Lianjiang Counties. Since the 15th of last month, the Japanese troops have repeatedly sent aircraft to bomb nearby counties and cities in order to prevent the Chinese army from setting out, resulting in a wide range of affected areas. In addition to the cities of Guangxi Province and Qinzhou and Fangcheng counties being repeatedly destroyed by artillery shells and becoming scorched earth, Wujia, Nali in Qinzhou, Dijiao, Dunhai, Zhakou, Duojiao, Jun'an Township, Guantouling in Hepu, Jiuzhou, Tanxu, Wuli, and Luwu in Lingshan were also bombed. The number of civilian houses destroyed is impossible to calculate, and civilian casualties are still minor. Currently, all counties are actively carrying out air defense measures and forcibly evacuating women and children to avoid poisoning. According to air defense agency reports, as of recently, nine Japanese aircraft flew to Lingshan County at about 10 a.m. one day and dropped more than 40 bombs, destroying more than 100 houses and killing or injuring four or five people. As for the Leizhou Peninsula, it has been very peaceful recently. Only on the 24th and 26th of last month did a Japanese aircraft fly to Haikang and Xuwen to survey the weather. Most of these aircraft flew out of Haikou, and seem to be newly trained Japanese air force units stationed in Haikou. Therefore, their bombing techniques are very immature, and bombs often fall in ponds in barren areas, wasting a lot of ammunition.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of the Japanese Troops on Weizhou Island. Weizhou Island is not far from Beihai. After the Japanese troops occupied it, they built an airfield as an air force base to threaten Guangxi and southern Guangdong. Since the Japanese troops invaded Qinzhou and Fangcheng, the situation on the island has been unknown due to the isolation of news. However, a fisherman named Chen took the risk to escape to seek a living. According to what he said, there are currently 24 Japanese aircraft parked on the island's airfield, and an aircraft carrier is still anchored at sea, carrying more than 20 seaplanes. Since the 15th of last month, Japanese aircraft have flown out several times a day, presumably to rush to Qinzhou and Fangcheng and Guangxi Province to cover the Japanese troops' operations. In the evening, Japanese airmen gather at the airfield to listen to the Japanese military officers' instructions on bombing and ravaging plans. The next day, they fly out again. There are currently more than 100 Japanese soldiers on the island, with more than 90 machine guns. Most of these more than 90 people are aviation pilots and junior naval officers and soldiers. There are very few infantry, so the land defense is very empty. As for the residents on the island, quite a few have been lured by the Japanese troops to return to the island to work for them. However, most of these people are usually hooligans and ruffians, who have long been despised for harming their villages. They are determined to be accomplices of the tiger. Who knows if they will not be sacrificed by the Japanese troops one day? It is now heard that the Japanese troops are still actively developing military roads on the island in order to make long-term plans to occupy it.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Sends a Telegram to Encourage the Soldiers and Civilians. Since the Japanese invaded Yin and Fang, Hepu is extremely important as it is interdependent. Deng Shizeng, the Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District and Commander of the Gao Lei Special Garrison District, has mobilized the people to intensify the war of resistance, strictly implement a scorched earth policy, and put everything into a state of war. In order to adapt to the needs of wartime, Huang Weiyu, the head of the county's National Guard Regiment, and Wang Manru, the deputy head of the regiment, recently ordered more than a dozen subordinate self-defense assembly teams to concentrate and be assigned to the coastal areas and the dangerous areas in the northwest to assist the defense forces in guarding. The strength is extremely strong. The various defense forces have also established considerable contact. If the Japanese troops invade from the east, they will be severely attacked. Chen Jitang, a member of the National Defense Committee, and Zhang Fakui, the acting commander of the □th War Zone, also sent a telegram to Commander Deng yesterday to encourage him to develop extensive guerrilla warfare and defend the villages. The telegram said, "Commissioner Deng Yineng, and transfer to the county party headquarters, district and township offices of Hepu, Qinzhou, Lingshan, and Fangcheng, as well as brothers Huang Tongcai, Zhang Meixin, Wang Dinghua, Huang Zhisheng, Ye Shouyao, and Liao Daoming: Since the Japanese have invaded our homeland, there will be no intact eggs under an overturned nest. I hope you will work together with the elders and encourage the younger generation to rise up and resist, develop extensive guerrilla warfare, and assist the national army in defending our villages. This is what I hope and pray for. Your younger brother Chen Jitang, Qujiang Zhang Fakui has forwarded the seal.</p>
<p>The Gaoqin Division Promotes Military Service. Deng Hui, the commander of the Gaoqin Division Garrison Area, believes that with the Japanese troops invading the southern route, and at this critical stage of the second phase of the war of resistance, the people's military service should be intensified. He especially set out from Maoming on the 23rd of last month with several staff officers to inspect Huaxian, Lianjiang, and Suixi counties. Whenever he arrived in a county, he would summon the heads of the National Guard Regiment, Zhuangchang, Jiji, reserve, and preparatory squads, as well as the heads of the districts, townships, and baojia, and give them instructions, encouraging all levels of autonomous workers to earnestly mobilize the people to enthusiastically respond to military service and strengthen the war of resistance. At the same time, he also explained the military service regulations. In order to encourage the people to enthusiastically respond to military service and prepare for the lottery recruitment of eligible men to be implemented from January 1st of next year, the Suixi County Government especially convened a military service meeting yesterday, deciding to set a deadline for the heads of each town and baojia to clear up the outstanding soldiers, and earnestly investigate and report the roster of eligible men under their jurisdiction, and punish the heads of townships and baojia who are ineffective in recruiting soldiers. At the same time, in order to make the people understand the meaning of conscription, the county party headquarters, county middle schools, and various drama troupes were appointed to form a military service propaganda team to use oral and drama performances to conduct propaganda in the countryside. The Guangzhou Bay Disaster Relief Association recently received a letter from the Gaoqin Division Garrison Headquarters, requesting donations of medicines for use by soldiers. It was considered that the officers and soldiers of the division were dedicating themselves to defending the country and serving as a barrier to the southern border, which was deeply admired. It was specially resolved to allocate 1,000 national currency to purchase and donate medicine boxes, which were sent to the division for distribution to the soldiers for use.</p>
<p>Rescuing War Orphans and Comforting Soldiers. With the outbreak of the war on the southern route, many war orphans in various war zones were displaced. Ms. Zheng Kunlian, the director of the Provincial Xinyi Children's Education Group, quickly prepared to establish a children's education group for the sake of rescue and protection. A preparatory office has now been established in a certain place in Gaozhou to start recruiting war orphans into the group. Such as the descendants of anti-Japanese soldiers, children of disabled soldiers, and children who have escaped from the war zone without parents or guardians, may be sent to the group by the various relief areas, county governments, county and city relief associations, and various army divisions and brigade headquarters. All expenses such as food, lodging, clothing, books, and pocket money for those who join the group will be provided by the group. The Suixi Youth Anti-Japanese Comrades Association believes that with the outbreak of the war on the southern route, the Chinese army is fighting bloody battles on the border, which is extremely hard work. For the sake of comfort, it has organized a comfort group to solicit comfort money and comfort items from all parties, and is preparing to bring them to the front line of Qinzhou and Lianjiang in mid-month to comfort the soldiers who are defending the territory and fighting against the enemy, in order to express their love and respect.</p>
<p>Various Counties Actively Destroy Roads and Dismantle City Walls. Since the outbreak of the Qinzhou and Fangcheng war, the coastal counties and cities on the southern route have intensified their preparations and first implemented a scorched earth policy. They are very serious about destroying highways and dismantling city walls. It has been found that the Maoming County Government, in order to thoroughly destroy the highways and consolidate the rear, has specially formulated measures to re-process and destroy them, and has set a deadline for the chiefs of the subordinate districts and townships to implement them in accordance with the law. The road demolition workers should requisition the able-bodied men in each township and mobilize all of them. It is stipulated that each Chinese mile must be demolished within two days. The Wuchuan County Office was ordered to dismantle the city walls, and has dismantled seven-tenths of them in less than half a month. It is still continuing to dismantle them at an accelerated pace, and it can be completed during the day. At the same time, County Chief Liu believes that in the second phase of the war of resistance, the people are more important than the soldiers. Organizing and training the people is the urgent task at hand. Recently, he has organized the able-bodied men who dismantled the city walls into teams and implemented military training, with excellent results. The Yangjiang County's city wall dismantling work is also about to be completed. In addition, various counties are also stepping up their work, such as relocating materials, and the work is progressing extremely actively.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Grain: Western Rice Arrives in a Steady Stream, While Dujing Rice is Slow to Arrive. Transactions in the Market are Mostly with Tribute Rice, and the Arrival of Dujing Rice is Still Difficult and Limited. <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The rice market is gradually returning to its original state. Yesterday, there were more transactions in the market, with unrestricted Saigon rice being the most popular because the price is cheaper and the rice expands well. Since japonica rice has become expensive, it is welcomed by most wage earners. In order to cope with retail sales, the shops are all focusing on this. As a result, inquiries were made in the early morning market. Western rice is gradually becoming tight. Saigon rice was once offered at thirty-six yuan for retail. As for the remaining goods, only the thick japonica rice from Zhongguan was slightly more actively traded. The price of Tongli white japonica rice was forty yuan, Lilian japonica rice was thirty-nine and a half yuan, Shengze japonica rice was thirty-nine yuan, Qingsi thin rice was forty yuan, and Nangang early and late rice was thirty-nine yuan. The number of Kejian rice on the market is scarce, and the price is very high, offered at a limited price of thirty-three yuan, but only two or three hundred bags. As for the high-grade thick japonica rice, no samples have been seen, so the actual limited price has not been fully implemented. Since Luyangjian rice is not subject to limited prices, it is restrained by Western rice and lacks inquiries, resulting in no transactions. The situation of Yinyuanyuan is similar. Since the sales market is gradually becoming active, people still dare not stock up too much, and only add to their stocks, resulting in a sudden slump. The evening market was suddenly stagnant, and the prices softened. At the close of the market, Saigonjian was thirty-five and a half yuan, broken rice was initially opened at thirty-one and a half yuan, then at thirty-one yuan, and thirty yuan and six jiao, Tokyo broken rice was thirty-two yuan, and thirty-one and a half yuan. According to statistics, the market was tight first and then tired, with fluctuations of nearly one yuan. As a result, according to the previous market, it was still flat. The source from the mainland is still cut off. It is heard that a certain party is arbitrarily detaining rice coming to Shanghai due to food shortages. They are either extorting or robbing, or levying taxes and extorting violently. The search is very strong, and there is no organization within it. Party A has released it, but Party B is still greedy. There are still treacherous merchants acting as accomplices of the tiger. As a result, rice has become a means for all parties to make money. After a portion of it is extorted as desired, it may be released, resulting in very little arrival in this city recently.</p>
<p>The source of Kejian rice yesterday was not strong. The market originally had a tendency to rebound. Fortunately, there was a lot of Western rice in stock and arriving in large quantities, and the price was still sold at the limited price of thirty-three yuan. However, there were few samples of special high-grade rice, and transactions were also weak. The total volume of transactions for the whole day did not exceed a thousand bags.</p>
<p>Western rice is arriving continuously. The Western rice that arrived earlier is being unloaded from the warehouse, and two more ships are expected to arrive today and tomorrow. Therefore, the price of the original packaged goods once fell to forty-two and a half yuan in the morning market, and then rebounded by two jiao due to the activation of the market. In the afternoon, because the exchange rate turned flat again, Saigon is now opened at thirty-six yuan and Tokyo Xian at thirty-two yuan and two jiao. According to statistics, the total volume of spot and futures transactions was three thousand bags.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Wheat Flour: Supply and Demand are Balanced —Wheat Refuses to Compromise— <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is flat and tired. The price of No. 2 flour factory is still at eight yuan and seven jiao per original bag. The price of returned goods from customers has become loose and flooded, because the offloading of Northern Ocean goods has recently turned lax. It is heard that the market price in Tianjin Changdi has fallen, and it would be loss-making to transport it from Qingdao. The only way is to exchange flour for oil, but the price of oil transported to Japan has also fallen, so customer sales are flat. Only the Nanyang gang is slightly adding to their stocks, and there is only the daily need of this street. In order to maintain the people's livelihood, the factory has been able to supply as much as possible. According to statistics, the total volume of transactions for the market and customers was over ten thousand bags. It is heard that the return price of Honglan car customer goods is eight yuan, eight jiao and eight fen, and the original price is six jiao and eight fen. The price of Japanese flour is also weak, with the December Phoenix spleen at eight yuan and one jiao, and the post-market goods that have entered the market at only eight yuan, five jiao and six fen.</p>
<p>The price of wheat still stands at the highest peak of fifteen yuan. Because the cost of production is high and the stock is low, the sellers are unwilling to compromise too much. The factory market is slightly active. It is estimated that Fuxin sold three thousand bags, and Fufeng sold two thousand bags. Changxi Sudan wheat is opened at fifteen yuan, and the warehouse goods were sold at a price of fourteen yuan, eight jiao to seven jiao and eight fen for ten cars of Changzhou wheat, which were purchased by this street and the warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Miscellaneous Grains: High-Priced Soybeans are Still Firm <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The source of soybeans is intermittent, causing the market situation to fluctuate with many twists and turns. Although the arrivals have not been heavy recently, the stock is quite thick, so the high-priced goods have fallen by five or six jiao from the highest peak, and the middle grade has fallen by one yuan. However, the export market does not purchase good beans, and the middle and inferior grades have shown a trend of increasing prices due to the previous excessive purchases. At the moment, this street and others cannot avoid being restricted. Yesterday, only 500 bags of Wuhu beans were sold, at a price of seventeen yuan, seven jiao to eight jiao, one car of Nanjing beans at sixteen yuan and nine jiao, 200 bags of Qingdao beans at twenty-one yuan and five jiao, and one car of Dingjiazhou beans at eighteen yuan.</p>

<p>Because this year's production of small fish is relatively small and transportation is more obstructed, the source is intermittent and the bottom stock is empty. However, the needs of various gangs are still strong, and the market is gradually tightening. At the moment, Ningbo small fish on the market must be sold for seventy yuan, which is ten yuan higher than before, and Zhoushan small fish is one hundred and thirty yuan, which is thirty yuan higher.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Financial: Floating Multiples Settle, Hong Kong Sells, and the US Exchange Rate Almost Breaks the Eight Yuan Mark <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed price, remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to harden under the easing posture of the previous two days, which was due to the sale of Hong Kong Electric Power and the closure of floating multiples. However, HSBC took the opportunity to buy a lot, so the easing trend was still slow. During the day, the opening price was similar to the previous day. Subsequently, due to Hong Kong Electric Power's consistent style, it first came to aggressively block the market, and the Chinese banks and merchants also competed to sell. Moreover, HSBC's absorption stomach was ultimately weak, and the trend was unsustainable. The US exchange rate almost broke the eight yuan mark, reaching seven yuan, nine jiao, three fen and seven li. The British gold also rose to four bands, eight four, three seven and five li. However, the selling trend soon slowed down, and the absorption stomach of foreign exchange companies such as HSBC gradually strengthened. Importers saw the situation and quickly settled on the forward-month US exchange rate without hesitation. At the same time, a certain Chinese bank also turned from selling to buying. By the time of the noon closing, the British exchange rate had returned to four bands and seven jiao and five li, and the US exchange rate had also returned to seven yuan, eight jiao and one li and two jiao and five li. However, it initially turned loose again in the afternoon, which was due to the heavy selling by Hong Kong Electric Power and Chinese merchants. Subsequently, HSBC's absorption stomach was still very strong, and some Chinese merchants saw HSBC's grand absorption stomach and repeated to do more, slightly picking up the forward-month US exchange rate. Therefore, the US exchange rate still closed at seven yuan, eight jiao and one li and two jiao and five li in the evening, and the British gold was four bands and seven jiao, six li and five li. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British exchange rate eased by zero yuan, zero fen, seven li and eight mils and one cent and two jiao and five li, and the US exchange rate hardened by one jiao and two fen and five li. It is heard that the trend of futures trading closely followed the spot market without any difference.</p>
<p>HSBC's Settlement Has Turned Slightly Stable</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London strip was about zero fen and six mils and two cent higher, while the far-term was flat. The price of silver in New York was still flat, and the price of raw gold in London was stable. The exchange rate between the British and American dollars and the French franc was flat, while the exchange rate against Shanghai was higher by zero fen and six mils and two cent. The US dollar rose by one point against the British pound, rose by one jiao and five fen and five li against Shanghai, and rose by two cent and five li against the French franc. The central listed price of each exchange rate remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot goods in the morning was four bands and six jiao and eight fen and seven li for British gold, and seven yuan and six jiao and eight fen and seven li for the US exchange rate, which was neither glorious nor disgraced compared to the previous day. After opening, Hong Kong Electric Power first blocked the market, and Chinese banks and merchants all had the intention to sell, and the market situation immediately became step hard. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric Power sold spot British gold at four bands and seven jiao and one fen and eight li and seven mils and five cent and spot US exchange rate at seven yuan and seven jiao and five li to foreign banks. When HSBC's listed price was announced without any movement, the white silver balance tax was announced to rise by half a point. After that, Chinese banks and merchants also sold spot British gold at four bands and seven jiao and eight fen and one li and two jiao and five li and spot US exchange rate at seven yuan and eight jiao and seven fen and five li to foreign banks, and the situation continued to harden. After 10:30, the public's floating multiples also came out of the cage, and Hong Kong Electric Power blocked the market, so the process became more and more loose, and the British gold stood up to four bands and eight jiao and four fen and three li and seven mils and five cent, and the US exchange rate also hardened to seven yuan and nine jiao and three fen and seven li and five cent. During this period, HSBC Datong and a certain bank absorbed the most. After 11:00, HSBC continued to come and absorb favorable banks for spot British gold at four bands and eight jiao and two fen and eight li and one jiao and two li and five cent and eight fen and one li and two jiao and five li. At the same time, foreign companies also saw the scene and picked up the foreign banks' January US exchange rate at seven yuan and seven jiao and five li and February US exchange rate at seven yuan and six jiao and two li and five li. Later, a certain Chinese bank also re-entered the foreign bank's spot British gold at four bands and seven jiao and five li, so the situation turned slightly flat. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was four bands and seven jiao and five li for British gold, and seven yuan and eight jiao and one li and two jiao and five li for the US exchange rate, which was looser than the morning opening by zero fen and six mils and two cent for British gold, and harder for the US exchange rate by one jiao and two fen and five li.</p>
<p>Speculators Slightly Pick Up the Far-Month Period</p>
<p>In the post-market, due to Hong Kong Electric Power's continued unloading, at the same time, speculators also came to sell slightly, and the potential re-shaped step was hard. It is estimated that Chinese merchants spit out to HSBC spot British gold at four bands and eight jiao and one li and two jiao and five li, and then sold to HSBC and other foreign banks spot US exchange rate at seven yuan and nine jiao and six li and two jiao and five li and eight jiao and seven li and five cent with Hong Kong Electric Power. After entering, a small number of speculators saw HSBC's absorption and then came to pick up the far-month US exchange rate, so the release stopped turning flat. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was four bands and seven jiao and six fen and five li and six mils and two cent and five li for British gold, and seven yuan and eight jiao and one li and two jiao and five li for the US exchange rate. The current month's British gold was four bands and seven jiao and five li, and the US exchange rate was seven yuan and seven jiao and eight fen and one li and two jiao and five li. The Zhi month's British gold was four bands and seven jiao and three fen and four li and three mils and seven cent and five li, and the US exchange rate was seven yuan and six jiao and eight fen and seven li and five li. As a result, compared to the previous day, the current period's British exchange rate eased by zero yuan, zero fen, seven li and eight mils and one cent and two jiao and five li, and the US exchange rate hardened by one jiao and two fen and five li.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Relentless Efforts by Hong Kong Speculators to Buy, Halting Further Cash Price Declines <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market was volatile and unpredictable. Although foreign exchange rates continued to ease, the final result was only a slight decrease of nine yuan. However, there were significant underlying reasons for this. It was mainly due to Hong Kong speculators constantly buying aggressively at low prices, which led general investors to hold back from selling, and many who sold subsequently repurchased. Although a certain money exchange firm that had been heavily selling the previous day continued to release gold, the quantity was offset by the buying. The day's trading began with a sharp drop of sixty-seven yuan, opening at a low price of four thousand and fifty yuan. This was due to easing exchange rates. Subsequently, securities firms and Hong Kong speculators entered the market to buy, causing an immediate rebound of forty yuan. However, as foreign exchange rates continued to ease, the price dropped again slightly to four thousand and fifty-eight yuan. Later, with a softening of exchange rates, confidence was somewhat restored, and with continued strong buying by Hong Kong speculators, the price was twice driven up to four thousand one hundred and twenty yuan. However, the price at noon was still only four thousand and ninety-two yuan, due to weak support from buyers and heavy selling by a certain money exchange firm. In the afternoon, the market initially stabilized, but later, due to further easing of foreign exchange rates, there was little buying interest, and traders remained on the sidelines. A certain money exchange firm seized the opportunity to increase selling pressure, driving the price down further to four thousand and seventy yuan. Afterwards, major buyers from Hong Kong once again exerted their influence, and with the help of a slight recovery in foreign exchange rates, the market closed at four thousand one hundred and eight yuan. The total trading volume for the day exceeded four thousand taels. The final price of gold ornaments remained unchanged, and the price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>The Decline Was Limited to a Slight Nine Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, as the exchange rate gradually strengthened, market sentiment became increasingly uncertain, with widespread calls to sell. The market opened with a sharp drop of sixty-seven yuan. Initially, a gold dealer sold thirty taels to a money exchange firm for four thousand and fifty yuan. Shortly after, due to the low price, securities firms and others bought at bargain prices. At the same time, Hong Kong speculators and a certain money exchange firm also aggressively bought. Although exchange rates continued to ease, sellers paused their selling activity due to the influx of buyers, resulting in a rebound of forty yuan. The money exchange firm bought thirty taels from a silver shop for four thousand and ninety yuan. After this, customer buying stopped, and as exchange rates continued to strengthen, securities firms reappeared, and silver shops also supplied aggressively, resulting in a further drop of thirty-two yuan. Securities firms sold twenty taels to a money exchange firm for four thousand and fifty-eight yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold dealer bought, resulting in a slight stabilization, fluctuating between four thousand and seventy and eighty yuan for a considerable time. Unexpectedly, around eleven o'clock, foreign exchange rates suddenly tightened slightly, and with renewed aggressive buying by Hong Kong speculators and securities firms, the price soon returned to above the four thousand one hundred yuan mark. Securities firms bought fifty taels from a gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and twenty yuan. Later, silver shops sold, causing the price to fall back to the four thousand one hundred yuan level. However, a certain money exchange firm revived buying interest, pushing the price back up to four thousand one hundred and twenty yuan. At noon, buying appetite weakened, unable to sustain the rise. Gold dealers and money exchange firms competed to sell, and the price fell back below the four thousand one hundred yuan mark. A money exchange firm sold fifty taels to a securities firm for four thousand and ninety yuan. Subsequently, the securities firm bought twenty taels from a certain silver shop for four thousand and ninety-two yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session.

Later, securities firms continued to buy over a hundred taels, pushing the price up another ten yuan to four thousand one hundred and five yuan. Subsequently, as exchange rates strengthened, selling pressure returned, and a certain money exchange firm supplied heavily, resulting in a drop of thirty-five yuan. A cash gold dealer sold twenty taels to a money exchange firm for four thousand and seventy yuan. Afterwards, Hong Kong speculators once again bought aggressively at low prices, and with foreign exchange rates slightly easing, general retail investors resumed buying, resulting in a surge of forty-eight yuan. A gold dealer bought ten taels from a silver shop for four thousand one hundred and eighteen yuan. Later, retail investors sold, and with buying interest subsiding, the price immediately fell back sixteen yuan. A money exchange firm sold twenty taels to a securities firm for four thousand one hundred and two yuan. Near the close, a certain silver shop bought dozens of taels on behalf of a client, pushing the price up six yuan, buying twenty taels from a gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and eight yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session.

The market was weak in the morning and stable in the afternoon, with a significant drop compared to the previous day. The price of American gold notes fell to twelve yuan and eighty-seven cents. The supply of Hong Kong notes increased significantly. The demand for French franc notes was scarce, and the demand for Singapore notes was also weak. The market was generally weak. The supply of Japanese gold notes tended to be smooth, and the market price eased, closing at one yuan, three cents, and three mills. The demand for Korean notes was relatively strong, showing a unique strength, closing at one yuan, one cent, and one and a half mills. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds and gold notes both fell by seven cents, American gold pounds fell by six cents, American gold notes fell by one cent and two points, Hong Kong notes fell by two points, French franc notes fell by one mill, Singapore notes fell by five points, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>

<p>The securities grey market saw a surge at the start of trading, followed by a decline, as the previous gains were considered too rapid and unsustainable. Yesterday morning, there was demand for Datong, Defu, Lianhe, and other stocks, with E-type shares reaching eight yuan and A-type shares reaching nine yuan, the highest prices seen recently. However, No. 4 and No. 20 shares were subsequently sold, and Yichang and Dingkang also saw selling pressure, leading to a decline of about half a yuan, though still slightly higher than the previous day by one or two cents. In the afternoon, the trend eased slightly, and as there were fewer sellers on the market, buyers engaged in adding to their positions. No. 20 shares were repurchased, and Lianyi and Tongkang also saw significant demand. However, Dakang, Chenghongda, and others continued to be sold, leading to a hovering state again. The final result was a slight easing, amounting to only about one cent. However, D-type shares were particularly strong, rising by five cents, as they had not opened for trading the previous afternoon. The total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Thirty-five shares of Xinxin Company were traded, with a price of six yuan and one cent.</p>
<p>The Public Association reported that while news favored industrial stocks and rubber prices also rose slightly, the bond market remained sluggish. The main reason was that the end of the year was approaching, and investors and speculators were unwilling to engage in new buying and selling activities.</p>
<p>A London dispatch dated the 18th stated that the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds in London had returned to stability, with no changes in any of the government bonds at any levels.</p>
<p>A London dispatch dated the 18th stated that the listed prices of British-owned Far East company stocks had risen slightly.

<p>The yarn market continued to decline, with strong downward pressure. This was because overseas cotton markets, which had been rising for days, had gradually subsided and showed signs of weakening. In addition, the easing of foreign exchange rates relaxed market sentiment, leading prices to decline. The fundamental problem was still the low actual demand. Most buyers were speculative in nature. Due to the unfavorable environment, everyone stopped buying and even began selling, causing the market to become flooded with inventory, and the market retreated again.</p>
<p>The trading of raw yarn had already become scattered, and actual deliveries became increasingly deserted. Most participants in the market were speculators, engaging in quick trades to profit from small price fluctuations. The opening price was seven hundred and twenty-eight yuan, down six yuan. This market opening saw few buyers and many sellers, and the market continued to fall. In addition, the decline in gold prices and the weakening of exchange rates caused prices to gradually decline, closing at seven hundred and twenty yuan. It was reported that after the closing, the price broke the twenty yuan level again. The total trading volume for half a day was 1,140 bales. Prices for 20s yarn fell, with Shuangma down thirteen yuan, Shuangqiu down eleven yuan, and Tiannv down twelve yuan. Today, 350 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 210 bales were shipped to Tianjin, and 305 bales were shipped to Haiphong. The amount bought by each dealer is listed below:</p>
<p>Trading Houses 880, Hong Kong 230, Total 1,140</p>

<p>Cotton trading in the local market was practically at a standstill. The poor yarn market and the slight decline in overseas cotton markets further dampened market sentiment. Traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude, reducing their trading activity. As a result, selling prices gradually weakened. However, factories had some slight demand, but the amount was minimal. 817 bales of Subei cotton arrived from Tongzhou, and 675 bales of Beisha cotton arrived. The asking price for Tongzhou cotton delivered at the docks was around 165.6 yuan. The details of spot cotton transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou 171.25, Shenxin Factory bought 550 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou 173.50, Rongfeng Factory bought 375 bales</p>
<p>American Cotton 195.00, Xinyu Factory bought 72 bales</p>
<p>In other news, the price of imported cotton in the overseas market: The fine cotton market initially rose by 3-5 points due to purchases by overseas cotton merchants. Later, due to large-scale profit-taking and some short-selling in the South, cotton prices weakened. As a result, near-term prices fell by 7-8 points compared to the previous day, while far-term prices still rose by 2-3 points. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by over one rupee, Egyptian cotton rose by 150 points, and Liverpool cotton rose by over 20 pence.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for imported cotton in Shanghai weakened again yesterday, but factory transactions did not ease. Japanese factories also intended to discuss transactions after the Lunar New Year. Transactions between traders were also very quiet. However, the arrival of American cotton had gradually increased in recent days. The delivered price to factories, converted at an exchange rate of 7.75 yuan for American dollars, is as follows:</p>

<p>The sugar market was stable yesterday. The association's pricing only saw an increase of 0.5 yuan for lower-grade white sugar from railway wagons, while re-exported coarse white sugar saw a slight decline. The spot price for first-grade coarse white sugar was 59.5 yuan at local warehouses and 59.7-59.8 yuan at foreign warehouses. 300 bags of re-exported goods were traded at 48 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar B brand was 59.5 yuan at eastern warehouses and 60-60.5 yuan at western warehouses.

The price of local rock sugar remained unchanged. National Sugar's Huanggang green sugar was offered at 45.5 yuan, and three-pointed white sugar was offered at 59 yuan. Brokers' bids were far from the mark, and there were no transactions. Green and red sugar dealers wanted to raise prices, but brokers were unwilling to buy aggressively, creating a deadlock.</p>

<p>The price of firewood has soared recently because the cargo ships are intercepted by a certain party. There are no goods supplied from the river, so the price of firewood has risen sharply. Small pine firewood is sold for only two and a half bundles per yuan, which is as expensive as cassia. Only Wenzhou charcoal has arrived. Yesterday, a certain ship brought over 500 loads of charcoal, which was sold by a manager of a certain company. Grade A charcoal was 11 yuan per load.

<h3 id="e59">Japan Opens Lower Reaches of Yangtze River, Aiming to Please the United States, Testing the Waters for US Reaction, No Concrete Measures Decided Yet <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that it is generally believed that the Japanese government, after months of extreme hesitation, has now decided to try to ingratiate itself with the United States in order to win its favor and avoid aligning itself with the Soviet Union. Japan is beginning this new policy by reopening the Yangtze River below Nanjing as a test. Since Japan has not announced the exact date for the opening of the Yangtze River for navigation by third countries, nor the conditions of military restrictions that must be observed, it is clear that the opening of the Yangtze River is a test, depending on the US reaction. After announcing the decision to open the Yangtze River, Tokyo immediately transmitted the news that the Foreign Ministry was carefully watching the attitude of the Soviet Union, which is generally regarded as "Madame Butterfly" signaling "Uncle Sam."</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Reports Developments</p>
<p>"The North China Daily News" reported that regarding the Japanese announcement to open the Yangtze River below Nanjing, a Japanese naval spokesman stated to journalists yesterday that the reopening of the Yangtze River below Nanjing will be subject to restrictions imposed due to military needs and methods to maintain peace and order. Therefore, the Japanese authorities' decision does not mean that the Yangtze River will be completely open for navigation. As long as military operations continue on both sides of the Yangtze River and upstream, some restrictions will have to be implemented. This decision to reopen is conditional, and the permission for general navigation will be limited to not hindering military operations.</p>
<p>No Assistance to Chinese Military Operations</p>
<p>The spokesman replied to questions that the Yangtze River will be opened for navigation and trade under certain restrictions, and foreign ships as well as Japanese ships will be allowed to carry cargo, but third countries will not be allowed to navigate the Yangtze River and assist guerrillas or Chinese military operations. Furthermore, navigation will not be allowed if it hinders Japanese military operations.</p>
<p>Opening Date Seems Distant</p>
<p>When asked if the number of ports would be restricted, the spokesman replied that preparations are currently underway. A final decision has not yet been made on this matter, and there may be a need to limit the number of ports. He could not specify when the decision to open would be implemented, or how long it would take to open the river. The preparations currently underway will take considerable time. The Japanese side will implement this decision as quickly as possible. There are still various issues to be resolved, and he could not predict how quickly the Yangtze River will be opened.</p>
<p>Wuhu Not Included</p>
<p>When asked if foreign ships would be allowed to carry general cargo or limited to items needed by foreigners in Nanjing, the spokesman replied that the restrictions imposed would not be of this form, but materials that could be used to assist the Chinese military would not be allowed to be transported on the Yangtze River. Some items needed for Japanese military operations would also be restricted. In response to another question, the spokesman said that the restrictions being removed could not include Wuhu. The Japanese side has studied this and found that it is not advisable to extend the expansion to Wuhu due to various military needs.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Hails Respect for Rights</p>
<p>When asked if the reopening of the Yangtze River was due to the demands of third countries, the spokesman replied that since the prohibition of Yangtze River traffic was due to military needs, any relaxation of these restrictions would be decided independently by the Japanese military authorities. A reporter asked whether the reopening of the Yangtze River was of a pacification nature. The spokesman replied that, as repeatedly announced, the Japanese government intends to respect the trading rights of third countries in China. If there is no impediment to military operations, the Japanese side has repeatedly decided to make efforts to open the Yangtze River for general navigation. The decision reached in Shanghai is a concrete manifestation of these sentiments of the Japanese government. He believed that third countries would be satisfied with this and understand that the Japanese authorities are making every effort to proceed with this matter.</p>
<p>Relaxation of Travel Restrictions for Foreigners</p>
<p>A reporter asked whether the spokesman's answer to the question of relaxation was "yes". The spokesman replied that he considered this a military matter rather than a political matter. Regarding the travel of foreigners on the Yangtze River, the spokesman said that this was a matter of principle. The Japanese authorities felt that any traffic must be restricted. Now that the restrictions on navigation have been removed, the restrictions on foreigners in the ports of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will also be relaxed. Before the opening of navigation, several matters must be noted, namely the removal of the Jiangyin barrier and the replacement of river markers to aid navigation.</p>

This group of six who were called up were all members of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, aged between 22 and 27, led by Major Pell Mao. They will first go to Hong Kong and then await orders, and it is yet to be determined whether they will be assigned to service in the Far East waters.</p>

<p>American missionary Duke was arrested by the Kyoto Japanese police on October 12 while traveling from Kobe to Kyoto. It is reported that the reason for the arrest was that Duke propagated news unfavorable to Japan, violating peace and security. After Duke's arrest, his wife and young children had already sailed to Shanghai from Kobe on October 30. It is now known that Duke himself was released the day before yesterday, and the Japanese court ruled last Saturday that he could not return to Japan without applying. After regaining his freedom, Duke took the Taiyi Maru (transliteration) wheel from Kobe on the 18th to Shanghai to meet his wife.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Rice Market Transactions Gradually Return to Normal Yesterday, Rice Industry Proposes Registering All Rice in the City, Joint Declaration Will Be Issued Stating Market Conditions <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>In order to comply with the instructions of the authorities of the two concessions, seven rice industry groups in Shanghai, including the bean and rice industry, the rice shop industry, the retail industry, and the rice milling industry, have not only ordered all rice merchants to comply with the newly established price limits and start business as usual, but also plan to urge all colleagues to register all rice with the Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association in order to thoroughly investigate the rice stored in rice godowns and rice shops in Shanghai. These procedures are currently being negotiated back and forth by the seven rice industry groups. It is heard that a joint meeting of rice industry groups will be convened within the day. In addition to discussing the above events, a joint declaration will also be discussed and decided to state the current rice market situation.</p>
<p>Various Industries Confirm Rice Fund</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association will hold its first board meeting at the bank club at 12:00 noon today. In addition to passing the association's organizational charter and ordering foreign rice registration methods, it will also elect five executive directors and hire office staff. Regarding the methods of registering orders for foreign rice, companies, firms, factories, and groups who want to order foreign rice can register with the association and pay a deposit of 20 yuan per bag. The remaining amount will be provided by silver shops, and the remainder of the rice order will be paid off after the foreign rice arrives in Shanghai. It is heard that registration of rice orders will begin after the board of directors passes the registration methods. The rice fund confirmed by various industries is already 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Transactions Gradually Return to Normal</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession Work Bureau and the French Concession Board of Directors effectively protect legitimate rice merchants to maintain people's food, the tea market of the Bean Rice Industry Association opened at 9:00 AM yesterday, and all transactions gradually returned to normal. Because the wind of rice rush has subsided and the authorities have sent detectives to protect them, rice shops have entered rice to supply the market. As for the fact that rice shops can hardly fully resume business, they will close the market early in the evening, and the rice shops in the border areas of the concessions will only open small windows for transactions to prevent rice rush from occurring.</p>
<p>Piles of Machines Congested and Difficult to Unload Rice</p>
<p>In the past, various rice firms and organizations entrusted Dafu Heyi Fujia Jianyuan and other foreign firms to order foreign rice from Saigon and other places in order to adjust people's food. They have now arrived in Shanghai one after another. On the 17th, the British Taikoo Company's Suzhou Wheel of 24,000 bags and the Qiongzhou Wheel of 14,000 bags have been temporarily unloaded at the Shuntai Wharf Warehouse in Hongkou. The British Lykes Lines' Zhongni Marre wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 35,000 bags of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. Because the Taikoo Warehouse and the China Merchants Warehouse on the French Bund were full of goods, they were transferred to Pudong and Hongkou Warehouses.</p>
<p>Rice Prices in Wusong Area Are Lower</p>
<p>Wusong suffered more serious losses than other places during this war. Nine out of ten city houses were lost, and even the village houses in the suburbs were only about 40% of what remained. As a result, residents who have taken refuge in other places have great difficulties in returning. Although the Japanese have posted slogans in an attempt to encourage residents to return home and restore the market, less than half have returned so far. Business is bleak, so food prices are cheaper. The first-class white japonica rice is only sold for 26.7 yuan, which is more than ten yuan different from the Shanghai market. For this reason, Gaoqiao Yiyitai and other rice shops have sent people to Song to purchase goods to meet the door market (selling price of 32 yuan). In one turn, each twist can obtain a thick profit of 5-6 yuan. However, poor people who earn hard-earned wages every day still have difficulty getting a full stomach, so they have to use auxiliary foods to lighten the twist burden. The so-called auxiliary products are nothing more than noodles, sweet potatoes, bran, and thin rice porridge. In particular, sweet potatoes are cheap, and each foreign dollar can buy 3.5-4 catties, so the sales of sweet potatoes in Gaoqiao have been quite large recently, and poor residents mostly use sweet potatoes as the main food.</p>

<p>Location: Xinzhazha Station between Changzhou and Benniu</p>
<p>Damage: Locomotive and four freight cars overturned</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese army has launched a large-scale counter-offensive on various lines. Regular troops and local troops hidden behind the Japanese army have also stepped up their activities to coordinate military operations on the front lines. Guerrillas in the Jiangnan area have been destroying railways and highways and attacking small teams of Japanese troops almost every day. According to a person from Benniu,</p>
<p>On the 17th at 6:00 AM, the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army buried several landmines with powerful explosive power near the Xinzhazha Station between Changzhou and Benniu. A train of goods cars from Nanjing arrived there at 6:50 AM and immediately exploded after hitting the mine. With a bang,</p>
<p>Thick Smoke Rose Straight Up</p>
<p>Villages within a dozen miles around also heard the loud noise of this vibration. When the person passed through the area by car yesterday, he witnessed a locomotive and four freight cars lying crookedly and overturned on the side of the road, with heavy damage. According to the person, the</p>
<p>Zhencheng Highway</p>
<p>North of Benniu is often destroyed by the Chinese. In order to "mop up" these elusive "itch bugs," the Japanese army built a branch road next to the Shiqiao Town on the Zhencheng Highway, 28 miles north of Benniu, directly to the Wei Village, a huge town in the north of Changzhou, 32 miles to the east.</p>
<p>Huge Town of Wei Village</p>
<p>Because the Japanese army built strong bunkers and strongholds in Wei Village, this road was built so that the Japanese military in the northwest of Changzhou could get in touch. On the morning of the 14th, at 9:00 AM, when the Japanese army road construction team was working 3 miles east of Shiqiao, they were suddenly attacked by a part of the X Regiment X Battalion of the New Fourth Army's Advanced Column.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Attack</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of machine guns and rifles rang out loudly. The Japanese army was surrounded on three sides and abandoned their weapons and fled in confusion. The Chinese did not pursue them and won a large number of trophies and triumph.</p>

<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that the French Concession Board of Directors decided that from January 1 next year, the license fee for "slot machines" in the concession will be increased by one-half. The French Concession authorities only increased the semi-annual license fee for such machines from 120 yuan to 220 yuan a year ago, but from next year, the semi-annual license fee will be 330 yuan. The daily profit of "slot machines" placed in large venues can reach as high as 500 yuan, so they will not be greatly affected by the fee increase, but those placed in smaller venues with low daily profits will be hit hard. However, it is believed that the increase in license fees will not force most of these machines to disappear, because the increase in license fees will only make their profits smaller, but there is no possibility of loss.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that cafe and tobacco shop owners north of the Suzhou Creek, who hold licenses from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), which allow them to operate until 2:00 AM, have recently received a notice from the Japanese Consulate’s Police Department stating that they must close at midnight. The reason is unclear. One theory is that this action by the Japanese side is to make the area follow wartime economic and sacrifice measures similar to those taken in Japan. Another theory is that this order is part of the vigilance currently maintained by the Japanese Consulate’s Police Department and is only temporary in nature, with Japanese-owned bars and restaurants also required to adhere to this order. However, it is widely believed that this order does not apply to any bars established by those with extraterritorial rights. Foreign nationals of third countries in the Hongkou area and within the Public Concession north of the Suzhou Creek are all troubled by this order. Many of the cafes along Wayside Road are established by German-Jewish immigrants. They were not only surprised to learn that the Japanese side had unilaterally shortened the hours stipulated by the SMC license by two hours, but also quite distressed.</p>

<p>After the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, various enterprises were immediately exploited. The so-called "Autonomous Committee," with its attached "Control Bureau," illegally "controls" the Dinghai turkeys sold in Shanghai for Christmas. All turkeys shipped from the countryside to Shanghai must be registered and taxed at the "Bureau," which is located at the old site of the local bank near Nanzen Bridge in Dinghai. With Christmas fast approaching, many people are taking risks and sailing from Dongxiang, trying to transport turkeys to Shanghai by detouring. This year, due to foreign exchange issues, merchants selling turkeys are making double the profits.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the French ship "Yong An" (1,422 tons), carrying the majority of the French garrison in Hankou, escorted by the French inland gunboat "Traige Gri," arrived in Shanghai and moored at the Swire No. 1 and No. 2 pontoons. French soldiers and their luggage were unloaded from the pier opposite the French Consulate and loaded onto twelve trucks, which drove to the French barracks. According to sources at the French Consulate, the French garrison in Hankou may not be reinforced recently. The future actions of the French troops arriving in Shanghai are currently unknown. They may be dispatched to Annam and then transferred to the European front. However, this move cannot be regarded as a withdrawal of French troops in China, nor can it be interpreted as being influenced by the Japanese government's request in early September of this year for Britain and France to withdraw their troops from the occupied areas in China. Last night, a British naval officer stationed in Shanghai told a Central News Agency reporter that the withdrawal of French troops and ships was a completely independent action and had no connection with the recent withdrawal of three British gunboats stationed in Hankou.</p>

<p>The Ou River estuary on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was previously harassed by Japanese warships, and the Chinese authorities strictly guarded against it, restricting the entry and exit of ships. The British ship "Manly Maller," managed by the Shanghai Shipping Company in this city, previously entrusted the Wenzhou Zhenxing Shipping Company to act as its agent. On the first day of last month, it loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Wenzhou. Unexpectedly, it was detained after entering the Ou River, and it has been a month since. It is now heard that after mediation from various parties, it has been released and safely arrived at the port with cargo loaded in Wenzhou the day before yesterday (the 17th). It is planned to load cargo and conduct a trial voyage to Wenzhou in the next few days. It is also learned that several ships, including the "Anxing," which were anchored outside the Ou River estuary, have also entered the port. Therefore, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Shenfu" ship loaded cargo and sailed to Wenzhou yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>The passenger and freight transport of ships of various countries sailing in the Far East has decreased significantly in recent months.

As for British and French mail ships, they still do not announce the sailing dates. It is also learned that when ships from various countries come to Shanghai, before casting off, those who load goods or purchase tickets are only given vouchers first. Passengers can board the ship with the vouchers, and the official tickets are exchanged on the day of sailing. Therefore, purchasers must prepare everything in advance.</p>

When they were cutting off the head and then sawing off the legs, they were discovered by their sister, Qin Zhu, who fled at night and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene, arrested the two murderers, together with the deceased's wife, Zhou Jing, the biological mother of Qinji and Qinxiang, and the murder weapons, and brought them to the First Special District Court. After the prosecutor examined the body, he ordered the family to collect it for burial, and after questioning and confirming the</p>
<p>circumstances of patricide and desecration of the body,</p>

The trial was originally scheduled to open at 2:00 PM yesterday, but due to the fact that the examination procedure has not yet been carried out, the trial could not be opened as scheduled. The Zhou brothers and their mother, who had already been taken to the High Court to await interrogation, were ordered by the head of the criminal court, Zhou Han, to be returned to the women's prison and the two murderers were returned to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for detention, pending a clear examination before a new date for the retrial is set.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Chinese Cargo Ship Robbed in Huangpu River: Six Boatmen Murdered: Cargo Worth Fifty to Sixty Thousand Yuan Completely Robbed: Empty Ship Discovered, No Clues to Be Found <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>At midnight on the 12th of this month, a case of a cargo ship being robbed and six boatmen being shot to death occurred in the Huangpu River. Only one person escaped and was rescued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Robbed by Bandits in the Dark Night</p>
<p>A local man named Zhang Sifu, nicknamed "Silly Big Sifu," owned a large-numbered barge. At 4:00 PM on the 12th of this month, he loaded 98 pieces of foreign yarn, 18 pieces of white sugar, and 5 pieces of miscellaneous goods, worth a total of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, at the Bund Wharf. He sailed to the Qichang Stack Wharf in Pudong, intending to unload them onto the Nantong Maru. At 11:00 PM that night, the ship was moored next to the Nantong Maru and was about to start unloading when three or four thugs suddenly emerged from who knows where. Each of them held a box gun and tied up all seven people on the ship, including the captain, Xiao Wuzi, and the others. The thugs automatically untied the cables and sailed downstream.</p>
<p>Six People Murdered, One Escapes</p>
<p>About two hours later, the ship sailed to the Donggou Port in Pudong and temporarily berthed. After waiting for another hour or so for the tide to rise in the Huangpu River, the cargo ship was sailed into Donggou Port. After passing the Qianlangzhong Bridge, which is ten miles away from the port, the seven people were dragged ashore and locked in a dark room, unseen from daylight. After about ten hours, at about 1:00 AM on the 14th, someone called out the seven people, their hands bound with ropes, saying that the "squad leader" had summoned them for questioning. They were escorted along a small path in the cemetery in the darkness. Among them, the captain, Xiao Wuzi, took the opportunity of the darkness to forcefully break the rope binding his hands, fled diagonally, and hid in a relatively distant broken coffin. The pursuers were unable to find him and escorted the remaining six people away. Xiao Wuzi lay quietly in the coffin, and soon heard more than a dozen gunshots. It is presumed that the six people had all been killed.</p>
<p>Water Police Station Begins Investigation</p>
<p>Xiao Wuzi slept in the coffin with the corpses for three hours. It was not until he heard vegetable vendors passing by on the road that he dared to climb out. He found his way to Donggou Port, attempting to take a boat back to Shanghai. At 9:00 AM on the 14th, he stood by the river at the Mailler Shipyard when a patrol boat from the Maritime Customs Water Police Station happened to pass by along the river. Xiao Wuzi shouted for help, and the patrol boat took Xiao Wuzi to the police station. After learning that the case involved robbery and murder, the boat owner Zhang Sifu was summoned for questioning. The investigation is pending.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Search Yields No Clues</p>
<p>The matter was learned by the Japanese Naval Port Department (at the Yangshupu Lan Road Wharf). For several days, they investigated the case quietly. Because the Qianlangzhong Bridge area was occupied by the pseudo-"army," they dispatched more than 30 soldiers to search the area the day before yesterday. Xiao Wuzi was also taken to identify the location. Upon arriving at the destination, they only saw an empty ship still berthed in Donggou Port. The cargo worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan was completely missing. The house where they were imprisoned could not be identified clearly because it was dark when they were escorted there. There were no clues to be found regarding the so-called bandit "squad leader" and others. Therefore, they returned empty-handed. They did not dare to send anyone to sail the empty ship back.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that last night (December 18th) at nearly 9:00 PM, an armored car belonging to the French Concession Police Department, parked at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Avenue du Roi-Albert, suddenly caught fire. A fire truck rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire and rescued a White Russian police officer who was severely burned. He was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. The cause of the accident could not be confirmed last night, but it was heard that the Russian officer was smoking in the car and fell asleep.

<p>In front of the Xiangfengchang Weaving Factory at No. 130 Rongqing Lane on Great Western Road in Western Shanghai, a shooting occurred at around 11:45 AM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Falling After Being Hit</p>
<p>At approximately 11:45 AM yesterday, a man, estimated to be around 30 years old, was seen running in the lane. Four men in blue short shirts and pants were chasing him closely. About ten steps behind the fleeing man, one of the men in blue drew a pistol and fired four shots. One bullet struck the man's temple, and another hit his right arm. The man fell in front of the Xiangfengchang Weaving Factory at No. 130. He died instantly due to the critical injury. The four assailants fled from the lane. The deceased wore a cat-fur long robe, a black velvet hat, cotton padded pants, and black velvet shoes.</p>
<p>Japanese Investigation</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Avenue Edward VII immediately dispatched two puppet police officers to guard the body. At 2:20 PM, puppet detectives arrived to investigate. At the scene, a girl of about seven or eight years old was kneeling on the ground, crying incessantly. After questioning by the Japanese military police, the girl only said that she and her father had come from Xujiahui. When asked about her name, she could not answer. The Japanese then searched the body and found two pawn tickets and a pack of British-American Tobacco cigarettes. The Japanese then took the girl and the pawn tickets to the puppet "police station." Around 4 PM, the body was removed.</p>
<p>Cause of the Shooting</p>
<p>According to an investigation by a Chinese news agency reporter, the deceased had taken a girl to the Dasheng gambling den in Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu, via the No. 7 bus from Xujiahui at 9:20 AM yesterday to gamble. After losing over 100 yuan by 11:30 AM, he left with his daughter. However, lacking bus fare, they walked home. Unexpectedly, near the Hu Mansion at No. 103 Great Western Road, bandits suddenly appeared and stripped him of his broadcloth overcoat. They then tried to take off his snuff-colored cat-fur robe. The man began to run for his life, and the four bandits chased after him. Reaching the lane, the bandits finally committed the heinous act.</p>

<p>Wang Yushi (32 years old), a native of Yancheng residing at No. 123, Lane 160, Changniu Road, had a cousin, Wang Youshan, who was addicted to opium. Due to the high price of opium paste, he switched to white powder (heroin) and had been unemployed for many years, leading a vagrant life, becoming impoverished and homeless. Recently, he fell ill. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, at 4:45 PM, he went to Wang Yushi's residence on Changping Road to borrow money. After a while, he collapsed and could not stand up, his condition worsening. The second landlord of the house, Guo Dechang, also from Yancheng, intervened, urging Wang Yushi not to take in Wang Youshan, as his death in the small house would be very inconvenient. Wang Yushi then advocated that he, along with Guo Dechang and tenants Guo Hailong and Sun Guangfu, carry his cousin Wang Youshan to the entrance of the lane, leaving him to die without care. He died at 4 AM the next morning. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station learned of the situation and took Wang Yushi and others into custody, handing them over to the court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them for abandoning a sick person under criminal law, arguing that Wang Yushi was extremely unrighteous, and the others, including Guo Dechang, were inhuman. The defendants hired lawyer Yu Enliang to request a lenient sentence. The judge ordered them to be remanded in custody to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial and sentenced Wang Yushi and others to one month of imprisonment, with Guo Dechang, Guo Hailong, and Sun Guangfu receiving a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Yu Jinfu, a local resident of No. 3, Meihua Lane, 820 Macgregor Road in Western Shanghai, specialized in manufacturing rosin material colored lampshades for sale. With the Winter Solstice and New Year's Day approaching, orders were particularly high, and he worked day and night to rush production. At approximately 10:30 PM last night, Yu and others were working upstairs when sparks from a gasoline spray gun ignited the rosin lampshades, causing a sudden fire. Thick smoke filled the air and quickly broke through the roof. A strong wind fanned the flames, immediately spreading to the adjacent building at No. 5. Neighbors nearby were awakened from their sleep, frantically moving boxes and belongings, causing great chaos. Upon receiving the news, the Putuo Road Police Station quickly dispatched many Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to maintain order and security. The Fire Brigade sent several pump trucks to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out at midnight. Two three-story buildings, Nos. 3 and 5, were destroyed, along with goods and equipment. A Shanghainese old woman, Zhang Du, 50, from the third floor of No. 3, suffered burns all over her body. Zhao Yang, a 22-year-old Shaoxing woman, suffered head burns.

<p>Ma Caizhen, a young woman from Xiang, was a maid at the residence of Lu Qinsheng, a wealthy man from the same village, since she was young. In 1936, when Caizhen was only 19, Lu, exploiting his position as master of the house, seduced and coerced Ma into a sexual relationship. From then on, although nominally a maid, she was in reality his concubine. When the war broke out, Lu took his family and Ma to Shanghai to seek refuge, residing at No. 1, Pingyu Lane, Route Lafayette. At the end of the year before last, Ma became pregnant. Lu's wife, Mrs. Xie, colluded with her daughter, Zhu Lu, and her son-in-law, Zhu Zizhao (the fifth son of the late Zhu BaoSan), to send the girl to Dr. Yang Zhenfu at the Pingmin Hospital on Weihaiwei Road, where they performed an abortion, causing the girl to suffer physical damage. Ma then hired lawyer Yu Zhaolin to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Lu Qinsheng and his wife, Zhu Zizhao and his wife, and Dr. Yang Zhenfu of seduction, incitement, and assisting in abortion. The defendants hired lawyers Xu Wufang and Sun Zuji to defend them. The initial trial resulted in Mrs. Zhu Xie being sentenced to six months of imprisonment. A warrant for Lu Qinsheng's arrest was issued. All details were reported in the newspapers. However, both sides were dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the High Court's Third Branch, causing the case to drag on for over a year without resolution. Yesterday, the court continued the hearing. The plaintiff's attorney stated the reasons for the appeal, requesting severe punishment. The defendants all denied having committed abortion. The court reviewed the evidence, declared the case clear, and announced that the verdict would be issued on the 22nd of this month.</p>

Recently, she became pregnant for five months, and due to shock to the fetus, she felt unwell, experiencing headaches and abdominal distension. Due to poverty,</p>
<p>Unable to Seek Medical Care</p>
<p>From the 8th to the 13th of this month, for six consecutive days, she went to the outpatient clinic of the Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital at No. 50 Route Tenant de la Tour every morning to seek treatment. Chinese medicine practitioner Song Yong diagnosed her, prescribed a prescription for preventing miscarriage, and gave her medicine to take home and decoct. However, her pregnancy symptoms did not improve. On the night of the 14th, Ni suddenly experienced profuse bleeding from her lower body. She immediately called a doctor from the Kemei Obstetrics Hospital to her home, but</p>
<p>Medical Fees Were Too High</p>
<p>Unable to afford it, on the morning of the 15th at 10:40 AM, Xia accompanied Ni to the Zhongde Obstetrics Hospital on Avenue Foch for treatment. Dr. Ding Junda of the hospital diagnosed her with a miscarriage and the fetus had died. He performed surgery to remove the dead fetus. However, Ni suffered complications and died at 1:30 PM that afternoon. Xia Yuanxin then filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division against the Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital for</p>
<p>Professional Negligence</p>
<p>Causing death. The court</p>
<p>Notified the Police and Law Enforcement Office to transport the bodies of Xia and Ni to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Coroner's Office. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court appointed a prosecutor and a forensic doctor to go to the office to examine the bodies. It was determined that Xia Ni died due to a miscarriage. The investigating officers reported on the investigation of the case and questioned the deceased's husband, Xia Shunxin, who only stated that he had gone to the Hualong Chinese Medicine Hospital for treatment six times, but his body felt worse and he saw blood, so he went to the Zhongde Hospital for treatment, but died. The official ordered Xia Shunxin to take the body for burial.</p>

<p>All the clerks of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Prison, because at this time of soaring prices of all things, each person's monthly salary is very low, and they cannot maintain their lives. Seeing that various institutions and organizations in Shanghai have already added subsidies, the entire staff requested the prison authorities to add 15 yuan per month to each person's subsidy to maintain the status quo. Subsequently, the late former Warden Sun Xiong reported the previous situation to the High Court's Third Branch for instructions. The High Court telegraphed the Judicial Administration Department to handle it, but after two months, they have not yet received a reply from the Ministry of Law. Currently, the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing every day, without end. As a result, the prison staff and others, unable to wait any longer, petitioned the authorities again yesterday afternoon. Acting Warden Shao Zhenqi reported the method to Yang Peng, the President of the High Court's Third Branch. Yang agreed to telegraph the Ministry of Law again, and if there is still no reply by the end of this month, Yang will be responsible for finding a way to subsidize them.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Charity Basketball First Game: China Suffers Defeat, American Team Wins Big, 63 to 27, Li Zhenzhong and Three Other Players Refuse to Cooperate <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The highly anticipated 3rd Shen Bao Cup China-America Charity Basketball Championship had its first match last night at 7 PM in the Western Gymnasium. The Shen Bao Cup was held by the Chinese team in the previous year, and this year the American team's strength seems very arrogant, and has the intention of winning the title. The Chinese team is also composed of the best players of the time. Unfortunately, last night Li Zhenzhong, Chen Juchong, Shen Yugong, and three others refused to cooperate with the Chinese team, escaped from the lineup for no reason, and eventually suffered at the hands of the American team. The result was 63 to 27. In the first half, the Chinese team was behind 17 to 34. Li and others disregarded international honor and charitable causes, and it is unknown what they had in mind. It is deeply regrettable. In this extraordinary period, the spirit and morality of athletes should be expressed even more. The spirit of the Chinese team to fight hard to the end last night was strongly supported and sympathized by the audience. In order to win and supplement strength, the selection committee decided to invite several famous players to join, in order to launch a counterattack in the second game and fight to the death with the American team. The list of candidates will be announced tomorrow. The several players who will be invited were originally the pillars of the Chinese team, but they voluntarily retired in order to encourage younger players. Now that the Chinese team has encountered obstacles, in order to achieve the final victory and make a comeback, it is their inescapable duty.</p>
<p>Excellent Enthusiasm</p>
<p>In order to maintain order, the number of tickets for this game was reduced compared to the previous year. Yesterday morning, they were all sold out early, which shows the depth of love and expectations for the Chinese team. Last night, the Western Gymnasium was filled with cheerful military music, which added to the excitement. The Chinese team wore yellow shirts and red pants, and the American team wore black shirts and white pants. The military appearance was very grand. The shoes worn by the Chinese team were specially made by the Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory, which generously donated them to the Chinese athletes. These Warrior shoes are strong and durable, of good quality and low price. At 7:15, after Mr. Brown gave a brief speech, Captain Chen Xianglong shook hands with Kerres, and the silver flute was blown, and the war broke out.</p>
<p>Three Missed Free Throws</p>
<p>The players on the American team were Passcoe, Baudewitz, Kerres, Goos, and Sartin. They were all the members of the McCrimmon White Team. Because the Chinese team members did not cooperate, the Chinese team had to use Xianglong, A-kui, Big Cat, Ren Feng, Bangzhen and Guorong as guards. After Xianglong and Kerres jumped up, the ball fell into Sartin's hands. Before long, Baudewitz and Goos were both fouled. Bangzhen and Xianglong missed all three free throws. The reversal of the ball seemed to show that the Chinese team was about to encounter misfortune. For three minutes, both sides defended very tightly. The Chinese team lost the chance to open the scoring, and the American team was unable to hit the target as hoped. When Zhuo Guorong fouled, Passcoe made a free throw. From then on, he went with the flow. In a moment, the American team had already scored five points. The Chinese team called a timeout to discuss military strategy. When the war resumed, Sartin was fouled again and scored a goal. Six to zero. The Chinese team still had nothing. After another minute, Xu Wen-kui of the Chinese team scored a point from Sartin's foul. The score was 7, and it was only then that the board was decorated.</p>
<p>Poor Ball Luck</p>
<p>The magical Xu Wen-kui's hand was extremely unlucky tonight. His shots that he was very sure of missed by a hair. It seems that the goddess of luck was playing a big joke on the Chinese team. It wasn't until after eight to one that A-kui made another free throw, but the loss outweighed the gain. The big cat occasionally made omissions, and Sartin took the opportunity to score twice, 12 to 1. The Chinese team was already 12 points behind. Twelve minutes have passed. Wang Nanqun managed to get rid of Sartin's shackles and scored three points, which boosted morale. Unfortunately, the American team lost as soon as they lost it, which was enough to offset it. Although the Chinese team has deployed fresh troops since then, it has not been able to cope with the American army's tiger-like onslaught. Only Xianglong and Wenkui occasionally hit the target. By the end of the first half, the Chinese team had 17 points and the American team had 34 points, exactly half the difference.</p>
<p>The Atmosphere of Revival</p>
<p>During the break, the Western Gymnastics Team performed on the horizontal bar, which was very attractive. After the restart, the American army only left Passcoe, and the rest were transferred to new generals. Because Li and others deliberately did not cooperate, the Chinese team lacked substitutes and had to use the original team to fight. Wang Nanqun was young and handsome, and his style was very similar to that of his brother Nanzhen. Carson, though brave, was played by this newborn calf in the palm of his hand. In one minute, Nanqun's linked bead magic shot pierced Yang with a hundred steps, which made the Chinese team present an atmosphere of revival. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan, and from then on, it collapsed. In the midst of the American army's full-line counterattack, Ting-hieu Er, Passcoe, and Henshawitz made successive contributions, and the score soared to 42 to 21, the gap getting wider and wider.</p>
<p>Finally Irredeemable</p>
<p>Although the Chinese team quickly transferred Zhang Jiakui out of the big cat, and soon ordered Guoxiong big cat to re-enter, not only did it not help the war situation, although A-kui hit a shot, the door was wide open, and Hughes, Carson, Henshawitz were like entering an uninhabited state. The Chinese team could no longer do it. After that, the Chinese team was once active. Nanqun was sent under the basket, and the big cat made two free throws, which was a counterlight, but it was useless. Li Zude will transfer A-kui, giving the American army three free throws. Finally, one of Henshawitz's shots fell into the basket, and the bell rang loudly. The Chinese team was unfortunately defeated by 27 to 63. Fortunately, there are still two games after this. It is not too late to mend the fold.</p>

<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Plot: This is a live drama, played out under the pressure of current life. It is tragic enough because, unable to withstand economic oppression and the rising price of food, a family of five commits suicide by ingesting raw opium. (See this newspaper on the 14th)</p>
<p>Location: Lane Changan, 39 Yangshupu Road, Shanghai - In a small room in a lane house.</p>
<p>Time: Afternoon, December 13th, 1939.</p>
<p>Characters: The protagonist, Li Axin, a tailor of Shanghai style clothes; his wife; and their two sons and one daughter, ranging from four to fourteen years old.</p>
<p>Setting: A corner of a dilapidated room in a lane house. Several teacups containing raw opium water are placed on a table, along with several broken chairs.</p>
<p>(As the curtain rises, the family of five is gathered around the table. The wife holds her youngest child in her arms.)</p>
<p>Li: (With a pale face) Rice and firewood are as expensive as pearls and cinnamon! How are we going to live! (Holding a teacup, trembling.) Children… everyone… come… drink coffee tea…</p>
<p>Wife: (Tearfully) Yes, children, poor things, we haven't… eaten for three days. Come, drink some coffee!</p>
<p>Youngest Child: (Reaching out from his mother's arms) Mom! Can I have some?</p>
<p>Daughter: (Jumping up from the chair) I want to drink first! (To her mother) Let me drink first, Mom! My brother has had milk; I haven't even had milk!</p>
<p>Li: Everyone will get some. Today is the same as always; no one will be left out, and I'll love whoever wants to drink…</p>
<p>(The youngest child and daughter fight over the raw opium as if it were coffee. The eldest son gets a cup. Li and his wife share and swallow the rest, leaving only a small amount. Fearing the poison is not strong enough, they dip their fingers into the remaining liquid on the table and pretend to put it in their mouths.)</p>
<p>Eldest Son: (Holding the cup, hesitates to drink) Dad! Why is this coffee bitter?</p>
<p>Li: (Angrily, then with a very tragic look) You haven't had coffee before! Drink it quickly! If you drink it, you'll never be hungry again!</p>
<p>Wife: Yes, good son, drink quickly! Drink it, and you won't be cold or hungry! Good son, drink it!</p>
<p>(The eldest son pretends to drink it all in one gulp.)</p>
<p>(A short silence on stage.)</p>
<p>Eldest Son: (Feeling abdominal pain) Mom! Why does my stomach hurt after drinking the coffee?</p>
<p>Li: (Jumping up from the chair, loudly) You talk too much! It won't hurt in a moment!</p>
<p>Eldest Son: (Retreating, whispering to his sister) Sister, does it hurt for you too?</p>
<p>(The sister nods.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, intense sounds are added from behind the curtain. The children feel excruciating abdominal pain, clutching their bellies and jumping around, rolling on the ground, screaming.)</p>
<p>Li: (Face paling, tears streaming down) Too sad, too sad! We poisoned our own children!</p>
<p>Wife: (Crying loudly)</p>
<p>(The couple watches their children fall one by one, jumping around in extreme distress, banging their heads against the wall until they lose consciousness.) (The curtain falls quickly.)</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Enjoying the Moon, Establishing a Family; Planting Jade and Nurturing Pearls, Skillful Pregnancy</p>
<p>It is said that in recent years, as the world has gradually become more unified, Chinese customs and etiquette have become similar to those of Europe and America. However, even in Europe and America, things are not static; they are constantly reforming. In general, this is all due to scientific inventions. Whenever there is a major invention in science, everything else undergoes a major change as well. Take weddings, for example. They have changed a lot from ancient times to the present. Westerners have always held weddings in churches, with a pastor officiating. Now, in many countries, it is not necessary for a pastor to officiate; registering with the marriage bureau is enough. Only a few religious believers still have pastors officiate. As for China, in the past, only a small number of people were Christians. However, people have freedom of religion, and the state does not punish them. Occasionally, weddings are held in churches, but most of them are held in a rented hall with a celebrant. Before the war, there was also a trend of group weddings, which was a good method. Because Easterners like formalities, and China has always been a land of etiquette, weddings alone could fill a whole book. Does anyone who does not study ancient rituals still remember the "Scholar's Wedding Ritual"? Group weddings are a simplified system and teach people thrift. Ordinary weddings often involve inviting guests and giving gifts, which is a waste of money. Wealthy people can naturally put on a show, but even those without money want to put on a show, even borrowing money to get their children married, and some never manage to pay off the debt. A group wedding costs only a few tens of dollars, and the wedding ceremony is performed without inviting guests or giving gifts, which is naturally much simpler. Therefore, even today, group weddings are still common in many parts of China, especially in industrial areas. In addition, their marriages are announced to the public in the marriage announcement section of the local newspaper, with a short notice saying that so-and-so has married so-and-so. To be even simpler, registering at the marriage bureau is considered a formal marriage. Now, let's talk about the wedding of Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyun, which is somewhat extravagant. They invited guests and rented the largest International Hotel in Shanghai. The guests included not only Lin Jiancheng's friends but also Jin Danyun's sisters and those related to Mrs. Su Liya. There were not only Chinese relatives and friends but also many foreign gentlemen, ladies, and misses. Besides those related to Mrs. Su Liya, Jin Danyun herself knew a considerable number of foreign friends. (217)</p>

<p>— He Yan</p>
<p>Fish are transported from tropical mountains to Shanghai from afar. Plus, now that foreign goods are soaring in price, selling them for two or three hundred yuan a pair isn't expensive per se, but to continue its original lifestyle in our tepid climate, it is certain to require things like TV motor to transmit heat. The fish farmers’ electricity bill is also increased, for without that, they will surely die in a foreign land, "Even the fish is so, how can human endure!"</p>
<p>Refugees are not polar bears from the Arctic, coupled with the fact that in the past few days, God was not on our side. The northern wind was harsh, the most tragic thing is that every day the newspaper would report the deaths of thirty to forty refugees! Alas! Is human life less valuable than fish life?</p>
<p>I hope those who raise tropical fish will buy a few less fish and save a few more people. What do you think? (Move money to save the needy)</p>
<h3 id="e107">A Humble Suggestion for a Rice Cooperative <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>The recent surge in rice prices on the market has caused great panic among the lower and middle classes, as well as social unrest throughout society. In just a few days, strikes have broken out one after another, and all four or five million residents of the city are feeling extremely anxious. Fortunately, the Municipal Council has taken various measures, but these are only stopgap measures. Lowering rice prices depends on smoothing the source and breaking free from the shackles of unscrupulous merchants. For example, rice from Wuhu is only selling for fifteen yuan per picul; rice from Changshu is only selling for twenty-two yuan per picul; and rice from Songjiang and other places is only selling for only twenty-five yuan. All these places are nearby, and even with transportation costs, thirty yuan per picul should be enough, but the Municipal Council's price limit is as high as forty-five yuan. From this, it can be seen that the high price of rice is due to the hoarding of unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, even if the source is smoothed in the future, there is still a risk of monopoly in the rice market. Therefore, to stabilize the entire rice market in Shanghai, it is necessary to rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses to complete the consumer cooperative. This will not only provide rice for all the citizens of the city but also give a serious blow to unscrupulous merchants. I have drafted several articles of association and implementation methods, hoping that all sectors of the city will abide by them, so that the citizens will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>(1) Capital: The capital of this cooperative is all borne by the members through shares. The starting capital is tentatively set at 60,000 yuan (the cost of two thousand piculs of rice).</p>
<p>(2) Members: This cooperative is divided into two types of members: basic members and ordinary members. Basic members must pay a share fee of one thousand yuan, and ordinary members must pay a share fee of twenty yuan. This cooperative has a total of twenty basic shares and two thousand ordinary shares, and may temporarily increase them.</p>
<p>(3) Rice Source: The rice of this cooperative is partly foreign rice and partly domestic rice, which is purchased and mixed by the cooperative and then sold.</p>
<p>(4) Member Rights: Basic shareholders may attend all administrative meetings of the cooperative and have the right to elect and be elected. Ordinary shareholders enjoy the convenience of purchasing rice.</p>
<p>(5) The selling price of the cooperative's rice: The rice price of the cooperative should be one-fifth to one-tenth lower than the market price when it is first established, so that the rice market will not fall too quickly. On the one hand, it can also raise a larger fund. After a considerable period of time, the cooperative's selling price may be sold at the market price.</p>
<p>(6) The steps for shareholders to purchase rice: Shareholders must submit a survey form when joining the cooperative, stating the actual number of family members and the amount of food needed. It must be certified by the service unit or investigated by the cooperative. However, the amount of rice purchased is not proportional to the number of shares but is based on the family's needs.</p>
<p>(7) The economy of the cooperative: Please ask the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association to send personnel to be responsible for auditing the economy of the cooperative. The economy is absolutely open, and if there is a surplus, it will be distributed annually according to the number of shares. If there is insufficient turnover at the time of establishment, please ask all companies and factories in the city to provide voluntary assistance.</p>
<p>(8) The administrative organization of the cooperative: The cooperative is composed of basic shareholders and several representatives of ordinary shareholders to form an executive meeting to discuss and decide on all matters related to the operation of the cooperative. However, the chairman must be appointed by a basic shareholder.</p>
<p>The articles of association of the cooperative are as mentioned above. The most difficult aspects are the procurement of goods when it is first established and the management after the cooperative develops. All of this requires a large number of talents, so it is necessary to mobilize all sectors of the city. However, the articles drafted by me are simple and crude. I hope that people from all walks of life will not only point out errors but also make every effort to promote them. First solve the problem of rice, and then start from all aspects of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, so that all residents of the city can enjoy welfare and the unscrupulous people will disappear from the market. I remember that the widespread development of the British cooperative business during the World War laid the foundation for the victory of the Allied countries. If we try to open the history of cooperatives, we will know that we must have great benefits for the public society. 12.15</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Characteristics of Films from Various Countries <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>The art of film, just like literature and art, has its own different styles. The following is a special article from the American Forum, which I have translated below:</p>
<p>America: In the environment of the gold standard, capitalism has expanded to the extreme, and the national habits tend to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh. Movies tend to be interesting and lighthearted, with the characteristics of jazz music. Capital and technical talent are more abundant than in other countries.</p>
<p>England: This eighth art can very well express their national character. It is full of a serious gentleman's attitude. Technically, it is far inferior to the United States, and it often makes people feel dull and uninteresting. But it is very much to the taste of the general British people.</p>
<p>Germany: The only country in the world that can compare with the United States is Germany, which fully utilizes its scientific techniques and artistic strengths. However, it pays too much attention to technique, revealing an unnatural appearance, and it is often heavy in nature, lacking the lightness of the Americans.</p>
<p>Russia: Film is a tool of propaganda, and the Soviet authorities use it as a weapon of propaganda. The colors are too strong, and it seems to lack interest.</p>
<p>France: There are often one or two smart directors and actors who create some of the lighthearted national characteristics of France. But there is always a lack of talent.</p>
<h3 id="e109">On Talents of the “Opening Leap” <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>"Opening Leap" is commonly known as Wu Chou (martial clown). In the north, the Wu Chou profession was led by Zhang Hei Wang Shezi (i.e., Wang Changlin) in his early years. Zhang Hei was good at performing plays like "Stealing the Silver Teapot" and "San Cha Kou". I have never seen them. Changlin was famous in the opera world for performing plays like "Nine Dragon Cups" and "Lianhuan Tao" (Connected Rings). Fifteen years ago, when I was in the old capital, I repeatedly watched Changlin's plays. At that time, Changlin cooperated with Yang Xiaolou and Yu Shuyan, performing at the Xinming Grand Theater in Xiangchang. Although he was old, he was still vigorous and energetic. Therefore, he could still perform "Opening Leap" plays. Xiaolou played Zhu Guangzu in "Su Lianhuan Tao" (Quick Connected Rings) and Wang Dong in "Ehu Village", still played by Changlin. However, due to Changlin's age, he could no longer perform somersaults and falls. What I saw on the stage was only his expressions, posture, and crisp, clean lines. For example, when Xiaolou performed "Lianhuan Tao" and Changlin played Zhu Guangzu, the first few scenes were mostly literary scenes, which were not important. In the later section of stealing the hook, although there were still two tables on the Xinming stage, the old man Wang could no longer do a headstand or a somersault. He was only "selling three thousand sheep." When he was about to go up the table, two stagehands helped him up, and after he finished his movements, they helped him down again. Although it was funny, the northerners loved to watch old antiques. As long as Wang Changlin performed this play, the theater would still be sold out. In fact, it was also because "things are valued when they are rare." At that time, there were fewer talents in "Opening Leap" than now. Besides this old Mr. Wang, there was only Fu Xiaoshan, who was in the limelight.</p>
<p>Fu Xiaoshan came from a non-professional background and was apprenticed to Wang Changlin. Although his voice was not as loud as his teacher's, his posture and expression were good, and his martial arts skills were unique. He was proficient in somersaults and falls. From 1924 to 1934, Fu Xiaoshan was the most popular "Opening Leap" talent in the north. Almost all martial artists invited him to be their supporting actor. Xiaoshan's best plays were Hu Che in "Battle of Wancheng", Zhu Guangzu in "Bawang Village", Huang Yidao in "Ehu Village", and Zhu Guangzu in "Lianhuan Tao". Unfortunately, he was fond of alcohol and died of illness in the old capital in the autumn of 1934.</p>
<p>At the same time as Fu Xiaoshan, there were also Lu Xicai from the Fusuicheng troupe, Fan Binlu and Liu Binsheng from the Binqing Society (who had been following Li Wanchun in the north for a long time and was known as the King of Somersaults), but none of these people became popular. After Xiaoshan's death, Ye Shengzhang and Wang Fushan rose to prominence. Shengzhang's martial arts skills were better than Wang Changlin and Fu Xiaoshan in those years. As for his lines and acting, he was inferior to Wang and Fu. Wang Fushan was Changlin's son and had been personally taught by Changlin. His skills were quite good, but his martial arts skills were not as good as Shengzhang's, and he could not perform at large gatherings, so he was not as popular as Shengzhang. However, Fushan was highly appreciated by Yang Xiaolou. In his later years, Xiaolou refused to invite Shengzhang to be his supporting actor and always cooperated with Fushan, which was a discerning eye.</p>
<p>In the past two years, two "Opening Leap" talents have emerged in the north, namely Ai Shiju, who is about to perform in Golden Drama, and Yin Jinzhen, who is currently performing on stage in Gengxin. Ai Shiju is proficient in both literary and martial arts, but his performance in "Opening Leap" plays is no less than his performance in Wen Chou plays. I have seen him perform plays such as "Shi Qian Stealing the Chicken" and "Huang Yidao", which are quite commendable. Yin Jinzhen is a high-achieving student of the opera school, specializing in Wu Chou. He has a solid foundation, and his tumbling skills are above Ai Shiju's. His lines and acting are not as good as Shiju's, and he is less experienced, but he is also a promising talent.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Talking about Zheng Bingru's Illness <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Yi</p>
<p>Zheng Bingru is indeed sick. For two days, the 14th and 15th, she didn't eat a single bite of food. It was really hard for her to cope with two major plays - "Embroidery Robe" and "Li Yanfei". From the 16th, her illness had improved, and she could sleep peacefully at night. Otherwise, how could she have supported the two heavy plays of "The Mad Woman" during the day on the 17th and "Double Wife Mirror" in the evening? Everyone says that actors are lucky and that they envy the prestige of red actors. I say that's not always the case. Just look at Zheng Bingru's performance on stage despite her illness, and you can know the suffering of forced performers. As far as I know, Bingru's fever was as high as 103 degrees on the night she performed the entire Li Yanfei. In private, she didn't even have the strength to speak. It was impossible to ask for leave. When the time came, she had to force herself out of bed, got into the car with the urging people, and swayed into the backstage. When she was putting on makeup, she had a burst of breathlessness and dizziness. After a five-minute rest, she was helped out of the curtain by her attendant, and she used all her strength to deliver the three important plays of "Da Baoguo", "Sighing at the Emperor's Mausoleum", and "Entering the Palace Twice" one scene after another. When she entered the backstage, she couldn't hold on any longer, and suddenly her eyes went dark, she felt dizzy, and she passed out. But the audience watching the play had no idea that she was a miserable person who was putting on a show despite her illness and forcing a smile.</p>
<p>Correction: The explanation for the Teochew opera illustration published yesterday was mistakenly "Suan Guen." It is specially corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Anna May Wong Signs New Contract with Paramount <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Huicun</p>
<p>Anna May Wong signed a contract with Paramount last year for four new films, which have been completed one after another this year. Recently, when she finished her last film, Paramount offered her a new contract for 1940, including six new films to be filmed within a year, two more than last year. The remuneration per film was increased by US$2,000. It is said that Anna May Wong was very satisfied with this new contract and accepted it immediately, and will begin work on the first new film at the beginning of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Anecdotes from the Opera World <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Several Bankers Who Enjoy Opera</p>
<p>In other words, if he's not in a good mood today, no matter how free you are tomorrow, or if it's a holiday, and you want to chat with him more tonight (chatting means small talk), he can immediately show an unhappy expression, ignore you, and lie on the kang to smoke. After smoking for a while, he gets up and tells the old woman, "I have to go to bed early today, hurry up and make the bed." These words are clearly an eviction order, and all the guests can't sit still and have to leave quickly. Therefore, if a certain banker arrives at the bank very late on a certain day, or sits in the manager's office and dozes off, then he must have been detained by Little Yu last night; but he is very happy in his heart. If he arrives at the bank very early and has an uncomfortable look on his face, then it goes without saying that he ran into a rubber nail at Yu's house last night and was sent home by the host with an eviction order. Someone doubts: "Since Uncle Yan is very rich and is regarded as the number one celebrity today, and the people he usually associates with are rich and powerful people, what is there for him to be afraid of, or to be looked down upon?" Who knows, things in the world often turn out unexpectedly. There are two ordinary people, one who can make Uncle Yan most afraid of him, and he has to compliment him. The other scolds him for being worthless, not only looking down on him as a successor to the Tan school, but also looking down on Uncle Yan's teacher, Boss Tan. Who are these two people? Let me describe them separately below. (164)</p>
