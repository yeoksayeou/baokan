<h3>英大使堅持兩項要求　東京談判陷於停頓　日派武藤少將訪英代表作會外疏通　倫敦消息日軍對禁運軍火趨勢沮喪</h3>
<p>（東京）關於英日會談、日方尚未接英方任何通知、故三日仍不得不繼續其停頓狀態、午前九時四十五分、武藤少將宮本少佐在外務省與加藤公使會談的二小時、協議日方萬全對策後、同赴偕行社訪問別各脫少將、述英國如誠意表示一般原則之具體的適用辦法、則日本亦可鄭重考慮英國之立塲、務請促進認識此項提議云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於天津事件之英日談判、刻已擱淺、警務小組委員會會議未能舉行、經濟小組委員會昨亦無進展、英大使克萊琪爵士與圓桌會議日本領袖代表加藤昨在東京意會作私人會議、歷一小有半、據日方消息、該會議志在準備下次全體會議之基礎、全體會議自七月二十八日後未曾舉行云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）英日現地會談中成爲難題之經濟問題、因英方尚未接得本國回訓、以致迄今不能繼續談判、二日午後、英大使克萊琪至東京俱樂部訪聞加藤公使、由加藤公使指摘關於經濟問題之種種、日本所提要求極爲妥當、在英國方面應鄭重考慮、並期望英國以眞正誠意態度、進行談判、（三日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據朝日新聞消息、英大使克萊琪爵士昨晚與日方首席代表加藤會晤時、曾提議各經濟問題不應列入議程、又提議圓桌會議、對於和平與秩序問題、應以雙方商得妥協後、卽停止天津封鎖爲基礎而處理之、聞加藤對於以上兩項提議、均已拒絕、該報又載稱、加藤與有田外相會商後、卽於昨晚在東京總會與英大使晤談、加藤常卽重行聲明日政府不能接受此項提議、並表示日方意見、以爲此决會議、非俟英代表團完全接受日方要求、恐不能順利完成云、今日小組委員會或圓桌會議均未開會、惟英火使或將再與加藤晤談云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日方半官通訊社今日發表負責文告、表示日本對於華北與日本國內反英運動及英日談判之態度、謂東京報紙雖載悲觀消息、以爲英日會議已臻僵局、其實目前地位並不若是絕望、日代表對於英日會議現所採行之手續、主張經濟與警務兩問題不可分析、不能專就警務一方面謀取妥洽、凡欲拆開此兩問題之企圖、實與有田克萊琪協定相背馳、至於日本國內之反英運動、乃國民情緒之自動的表示、華北民衆運動、乃英國親蔣政策所致云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國副國務卿威爾斯昨日向新聞記者聲稱、國務院曾致特別訓令於美國駐日大使館代辦杜曼、囑向日本政府抗議日軍佔領區內反對外人運動之危險、威爾斯說明、杜曼曾於星期二日、以私人談話方式、向日本提出該項抗議、指出目前在日軍佔領區內之反英運動、已變成普遍的反外運動、美國政府對此、極爲關懷、是以美國欲日本負目前反外運動之責、關於日報非正式載稱、日本政府擬召回日本駐美大使之說、威爾斯稱、渠不見日本政府或將出此、關於美國駐華各地領事編繕中日戰事爆發以來美日兩國間糾紛統計、威爾斯聲稱、美國駐華各地領事或曾根據固定訓令、編造該項統計、渠雖不悉事變確數若干、然根據所得報告、此種糾紛已逾六百餘起、關於反英運動已擴大爲反美運動、威爾斯稱、國務院密切注意侵犯美國人民利益、美國政府習慣上僅注意本國人民之利益、並擬續採獨立政策、（三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府某發言人昨向記者聲稱、日本在佔領區內所推行反英運動、實已破壞有田克萊琪恊定、至於日方是否故意破壞此項英日方案、抑爲無力履行諒解條件、則一時尚難明悉、日本外務省當局或願履行協定上之義務、但日軍駐華當局或仍依其獨立之政策、而加緊反英工作、亦未可必云、英美法三國當局現仍爲遠東問題交換意見、英國對於天津白銀問題、態度更趨於強硬、並堅拒日方之法幣要求、據稱、英國內閣會議時、曾考慮目前東京談判失敗時、英國是否廢止一九一一年英日商約、英國現擬將東京談判時期、盡力展延云、又聞英國內閣對加拿大贊助廢止英日商的、頗受鼓勵、但澳洲及印度、因大量棉毛織品輸日關係、對於廢的並不熱烈贊助、同時英國政府接得可靠消息、謂日本軍事領袖對於中國情勢之不定、及英美聯合禁止軍火輸日之可能、沮喪之氣、已大加增、（三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）上院反對黨領袖史尼爾勳爵、今日在開始外交辯論時、要求外相哈立法克斯勳爵解釋柬京方案、並保證政府不變更對華政策、繼續支持中國法幣、史氏宣稱、首相張伯倫對於各議員探詢消息、似有激怒及暴躁之表示、諸議員多少在朦朧之中工作、除自政府方面獲得近於厭惡之些微消息外、須讀報始能詳知一切、（三日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>論自然節約</h3>
<p>居今而猶侈談享用，是其識見，誠與「何不食肉糜」相等倫矣。蓋即就七月分物價以論，各業登報聲明漲價者已有一百五十有二起之多，其隨大市轉移而不登報公告者正不知尚有幾何；八月一日之各業漲價廣告，又何止十數起，而繼之以起者尚方興未艾。職是之故，上海居民之懼旨甘不繼，困於「開門七件事」者，除絕少數席豐履厚及投機起家之富翁外，莫不同感痛苦，深慮來日方長，物價有漲無已，將不勝仰事俯畜之任。然默察其生活狀况，則仍習於侈泰，爭尚奢靡，藐不知儉素之可貴，而徒憂物價昂騰，謀生維艱，抑亦矛盾甚已！</p>
<p>國難至此，嚴重極矣，生活至此，困難極矣，遘國難而生活艱苦，固理所應然，分所當爾，蓋國事重於生活者倍蓰。况今日所謂困難者，尚不至食不果腹，衣不蔽體。歐戰之中，德國接濟斷絕，計口發給麵包，錙銖必較，食量大者，幾無以果腹；又以棉花匱乏，凡棉製臥具衣着，悉由政府徵用用製彈藥，而代以紙製者；他如日用必需品，悉無從購置，而國民處之泰然。此猶因戰爭而致然，而在承平時代，蘇聯實行第一五年計畫期中，亦嘗計口給食，舍生活所必需者外，其他享用物品，悉供輸出，以易現金，國民雖出重價而不可得，合辛茹苦，卒以興邦。上海居民苟一念及此，則對於目前之困難，亦良足寬慰矣。且夫兵爲凶事，古有明訓，故國家苟非萬不得已，不輕用兵，而此决中國之抗戰，實被迫而出此，勝則雪多年之國恥，樹復興之基礎，國民之前途幸福，將不可限量，敗則子子孫孫將淪於萬刧不復之境，遑論個人之財產，今最後勝利，可操左券，則區區暫時之困難，亦何足恤！</p>
<p>即以常理而論，多難可以興邦，逸豫足以亡身，故富裕實不足恃；寇萊公功業彪炳，冠絕一時，徒以豪侈自奉，而其子孫遂多窮困，可爲殷鑒。是以世之由富而貧，由貧而富，循環往復，有似自然界爲之均貧富，劑盈虛，而不知此乃驕奢勤儉必然之因果也。今物價已再漲三漲矣；滬上大多數之人士，亦將被迫而趨於節的之一途。此被迫節的亦可謂自然節的之結果，非有所覺悟於驕奢淫佚之不當也；蓋富厚者揮霍如常，則其消耗也愈甚；中產者不改生活，則其拮据也更深；爲延續其生命起見，固有不得不如是者也。惟其如是，故其節的也難久，事過境遷，故態復萌。吾人非望人人能厲行節的也，要當守其本分，不爲已甚，已難能可貴矣。蓋今之世，而望其志於道不恥惡衣惡食者，行將以迂腐目之，故有爲生活而不屑卑躬屈節，自命爲識時之俊傑者矣。由是可知奢侈之罪惡，習非成是，積汚成垢，理智汩滅，私慾橫蔽，吾躬不閱，遑恤吾後，豈尚有所愛於家國也哉！</p>
<p>雖然，孔子有言：「富與貴，是人之所欲也，不以其道得之，不處也：貧與賤，是人之所惡也，不以其道得之，不去也。」可見古人於貧富貴賤取去之間，尚有一分寸在，此分寸之自然裁度，即在此方寸之間耳！吾人固不幸，而逢此陽九百六之世：吾人亦何幸，而得飽嘗憂患，多歷世故，志彌堅而行彌卓，是天予吾人以淬厲之機會，豈可自忘其職責，耽於淫樂，沉湎酒色，而以爲人生行樂耳，個人之享用固應如是。邇者上海外滙暴縮，物價飛漲，推原其故，未始不由滬上人士過事享用所致然，與法幣焉何尤。苟滬上人士能知國步艱難，摒棄奢侈，厲行節的，則今日之生活，恐未必遽臻如是之艱難也。</p>
<p>自助者天助，所望以得人助者，亦應盡其自助之力，吾則人將以偸惰耽逸樂無堅苦卓絕之民族目我，其能倖存於天地之間哉！是則淡泊足以明志，甯靜所以致遠，果能由自然節的而實行節的，恢復中華民族固有之儉德，不禁跂予望之矣！</p>
<h3>法幣穩定問題　英主張修正辦法　各銀行均願補充基金　惟以平衡進出口為限</h3>
<p>（倫敦）前與組織一千萬鎊中國貨幣平準基金事有關之英人銀行、雖尚未經政府接洽繼續供給款項事、然聞各銀行甚願爲之、祇須財政部仍予以擔保耳、原有平準金之現有地位極難估計、惟聞已用去甚多矣、據倫敦人士之意見、如平準基金予以補充、則其辦法必須加以若干修改、聞近有藉平準基金之媒介、而便利中國資金之逃亡者、此事必須制止、此後基金祇可用以維持出入口之適當平均爲限、此事或在進行中、關於補充平準基金之任何談判並非爲銀行範圍內事（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間各報現仍密切注意遠東局勢、在中國日軍佔領區內反英運動之激烈、東京會議因以僵擱之幣制問題、各報皆視爲極關重要、下院中國事務委員會昨夜集議、聞對於中國幣制問題與華北局勢曾加以詳細討論、聞下院議員近曾以私人資格往見首相張伯倫、陳說以堅强態度應付日本要求之絕對必要、每日電報今日載一論文、題爲「日本誘令中國法幣自殺之策略」、謂日本未能以自己方法殺害中國法幣、現惟有僱用他人爲之耳云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）金融新聞報頃評論中國法幣問題云、張伯倫首相曾保證、英國對華政策決不變更、此層可以令人獲有鼓勵、但為政府計、仍宜療續切實有所作為、以維護中國法幣、蓋法幣之穩定、匪特適合正文、且有關英國威信、而於吾國經濟利益、又極關重要、此乃無可吾認之事、茲若聽住日本陷中國幣制於崩潰而强在中國樹立貨幣堡壘、吸引該國加入日圓集團、則吾國對華貿易、必且一蹶不振、職是之故、吾國維護中國法幣、實有充分理由、特其代價未可過高耳、以目下情形觀之、此項代價未必甚昻、所當決定者端爲維護時所用方式、究以何種最爲有利、此項問題頗爲複雜、爲政府計、祗須以巨額信用放款畀予中國、即可减輕中國法幣所受壓力、此外、日本要求天津存銀移交日方、宜堅決予以拒絕、務勿援助日本將法幣逐出華北之外、則以協助日本樹立傀儡幣制、即無異於自殺故也」云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本國內　民不聊生　又須增所得稅</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府爲每年增加所得稅五萬萬元起見、已向捐稅改革行政會提出所得稅新辦法、主張按照下列四類徵收所得稅、（一）地產與股息、（二）商業與職業、（三）賺得之收入、薪水與恩給金、（四）團體收入、依家庭人口之多寡、給予固定之核减、惟收入在五百元以下者、始可免繳所得稅、新稅之標準率、爲第一類百分之十、第二類百分之八·五、第三類百分之六、第四類百分之八、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日木報紙今日繼續攻擊美國政府廢止一九一一年美日商的、東京日日新聞聲稱、「不僅老奸巨猾之英國、須受敎訓、即損害及莽撞之國家、亦須同樣受訓」、都新聞稱、「目前日美關係、美國須負其咎、美國廢止一九一一年商的、使日美友誼關係中止、羅斯福總統已將二十八年來日美友誼破壞無遺、倘美國堅持拒絕認識亞洲新秩序、我儕當視美國爲我國之仇敵、」日本報紙堅稱、日本能抵抗美國禁止戰事原料輸往日本、並暗示日本不願在此方面試騐日本能力、同時日本報紙繼續激烈反英運動、將兩年來中國之不靖、多歸咎於英、謂去年企圖行刺北平「臨時政府」高級官吏、亦起源於天津英租界、（三日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>美英同時對日抗議　英報謂為又一警吿　各議員又在下議院質問　虹口租界江通航問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日郵報今日發表社論、題日「又一警告」、內稱、英美兩國現已有更密切之聯合、以對抗日本在華傲慢之策略、如望東京會議繼續進行獲有成效、則非彼等停止此項策略不可、硬强之文字或可使日本之政治家得有印象、惟欲使日本在華軍事領袖有所認識、則或須有更進一步之表示、須知吾人及美國均握有强大之經濟武器、在一九三九年最初三個月內、英國購買日貨、價値近二百五十萬鎊、而售於日本者則僅値三十萬鎊、吾人極有平反此種差額、而予日本以絕大不利之可能云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士昨就華北反英示威運動向日本政府提出抗議、美國駐日代辦杜曼亦就中國淪陷區內近頃所發生之反美事件提出交涉、此事頃由每日快報加以評論云、「英美兩國同時向日本政府提出抗議、於以見英國政府正與美國政府亦步亦趨、可爲欣幸、誠以吾國旣在遠東方面與美國保有同樣利益、彼此兩國主張亦復從同、自應與該國遵循同一途徑、幷以其所採方式、所抱目標爲楷模」云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、保守黨議員諾克斯少將、會提出詢問云、政府前於六月六日訓令駐日大使克萊琪爵士、着其就日本在中國長江一帶限制英國商業一事、提出交涉、未知有吾接獲答案、外務部决官勃特勒當即答曰、「吾」諾克斯乃謂、「自提出交涉之時起、以迄目下、已歷八星期之久、縱使日本政府遲遲作答、已成習慣、要亦應在此期間、提出答案」、勃特勒次官乃又答稱、「八星期時問、在理已極充分、且本問題性質、頗爲緊急、此政府所由飭令克萊琪大使賡續催促日一本政府即予答覆是也、」至是、自由黨議員曼德亦提出詢問云、「美國向日本提出抗議、以至接獲答案、未知需時幾何、「勃特勒次官置之不答、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）保守黨議員格拉漢今日在下院問殖民大臣麥店納、日本常局自大陸各小口岸截斷往香港之食物給養一舉、已吾引起渠之注意、麥氏答稱、香港政府刻正縝密注視當地食物之局勢、迄今爲止、無需採取特殊步驟以獲得給養云、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>英波關係與澤問題</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>倫敦航訉</p>
<p>英國張伯倫首相的外交路錢，以及執行這一路綫的方法，看起來，在一個純粹客觀的人士眼裹，是覺得厭惡的，如果再輕鬆一點，他也許會發出一聲冷笑。但當我們一想到這是關涉到全世界未來命運，而我們却又是處身其中時，那末，大抵的情形，是會覺得難受的吧，因而覺得是不得不再從自己崗位上進一步的努力了。共實，縱使從純粹英國帝國主義利益的立塲去看，張伯倫的路錢及方法，也還是非常危險的。他算是一步一步地，把英帝國的前途，向一個峭壁的邊緣推去，似乎不達目的，絕不甘心。這一點，目前連英國保守黨裏所謂「死硬派」的人士，比較頭腦淸楚一點的份子們，也都覺出來，而且提出了反對：並且反對無效，已經斷念於張伯倫政策的改良了。我曾經做過不十分精密然而大體可說無誤的統計和分析，那結果表示着：目前英國剩下來極少數極少數的，仍然贊成張伯倫政策的人裏面，平常不留心國際政治，頭腦不淸的人，佔着一個百分之八十以上的成數；其餘的百分之二上中，年紀老大（七十歲是起馬的歲數）的人們，佔一半，再有一半就是別有用心的人們。</p>
<p>誰都同意英國目前爲了保持她未來帝國的生存，僅僅有三條路可走；一條，是英，美，法，三國聯合起來，站在一條綫上，締結一個同盟關係；如果這不可能，那未，其次一條，是把蘇聯和一切弱小而安全又受威脅的國家，拉在一處，組成一個聯合戰綫；如也不願走這一條，那末，還有一個唯一剩下來的第二條路，那是：加强英，法，與那些和蘇聯接壤國家之間的聯繫。那樣，萬一與德，意，發生衝突，使那時蘇聯的袖手不問，爲完全不可能。</p>
<p>英波，英土，兩公的的成立，所以先後令德，意，吃了一大驚的緣故，就在此。所以當英波公的談判的時候，波蘭外長伯克上校到倫敦來的那幾天，他的氣燄之高，眞可說是「不可一世」。而英國這一面，對於他來訪的重視，照我看，縱使說是超過於去年法國大總統的「國家訪問」，也並不爲過的。柏克一再地公然向人說，英波公的的成立與吾，波蘭對之，是無所謂的；牠的最大利益，還是對於英國。後來，當哈立法克斯把英國片面担保波蘭安全變成相互之間的互助公約時，在他，眞可說是費了九牛二虎之力。所出的代價，連借款等等全納在裏面算，雖然已經高得可觀，但總結下來，在英國還算是外交上一個重大的收穫。這一點，任何觀察家，都是同意的吧。</p>
<p>那末，英波目前和今後的關係，應該可以完全圓融地進行下去了吧。。但事實上，是並不然的。</p>
<p>現在英波之間，爲着進一步鞏固同盟關係，而舉行着的一談判，一共有兩個：一個是華沙進行着的英波參謀部之間的談判；另一，則是在倫敦舉行着的借款談判。而作爲英波兩國間爭執的焦點，使上述兩個會議難以收到圓滿進行效果的，却是那個所謂但澤問題。</p>
<p>但澤也的確是當前的一個大大的問題。但牠僅僅是一個國際問題，決不是德波兩國間爲了爭執但澤本身的問題。換句話說，如果由德波兩國間去直接談判這一問題，那末，解決之道，也許立即就發現了出來。但一放在國際的範圍內，牠的複雜性，却立刻增加了無數倍。</p>
<p>大家都知道，現在仍然滯留在莫斯科，担當英，法，蘇，三角折銜中，英國要角的史德蘭，一個多月前，他是留在華沙正和波蘭當局間，談判着但澤問題的。那時，他所負的任務，是代表英國政府，勸吿波蘭當局，「和平」地放棄但澤，經過英國的「調停」。這一建議，馬上就被柏克加以拒絕，到後來，他甚至拒絕和這位史德蘭再談到但澤問題。這樣的殭局裏，史德蘭就被忽忽召回了本國，叉忽忽地踏上了另一個担當重大任務的途程，飛到了莫斯科去。於是英波間爲但澤而接洽着的談判，就暫時中斷了。</p>
<p>這一談判終止了不久，德國的納粹黨徒，忽然大批向但澤自由市公然地開了進去，而且帶着大砲機關槍。同時，德屬東普魯士的邊境上德國大軍雲集起來了。誠然，據當時種種可靠的消息和象徵推斷，德國這一舉，目的祗是在試探國際上的反應而已，他的奪取但澤的陰謀，最早應是八月，當時的準備，是並沒有成熟的。於是接着波蘭的大軍，也雲集了起來，牠的當局宣稱着萬一德國奪取但澤時，無論用「從內奪取」方式或「從外侵略」的方式，波蘭準備立刻把軍隊開進但澤去。同時，波蘭把這態度通知了英國。</p>
<p>於是，張伯倫首相着實慌張了一下；在一個短時期內，歐洲的戰雲，似乎已瀰漫了整個空間。張伯倫非常怕波蘭眞會和德國打了起來，把英，法，也帶了進去。於是趕緊徵求波蘭的意見，看是不是還有和解的途徑。波蘭的回答，却是一個斬釘截鐵的「沒有！」她的當局吿訴英國當局，萬一德國佔取但澤，波蘭就認爲道已經是到了絕無妥協讓步的境地，已經妨害了「波蘭的重大利益」，影響了「波蘭的獨立與生存」，她認爲有値得一戰的意義了。</p>
<p>我們要記住；希特勒對於但澤這一賭注，是壓的一個英國不管，壓的一個英國不願爲但澤而戰。那末，他計算着，這樣虛張聲勢地一來接下去，不是波蘭受英國壓力而屈服；就是英國因提防牽及自己，而疏遠波蘭，這樣子，英波互助公的，就會起了一個大大的裂痕。</p>
<p>當時英國內部的人們，是完全懂得希特勒道照例的外交戰術的。於是，大家就異口同聲地壓迫張伯倫首相，趕緊表示英國的態度。而其實，張伯倫首相早就不止一决地表示過了，英國不獨不願爲但澤問題而戰，而且，如果希特勒在別的問題上可以妥協的話，英國甚至可以有把握壓迫波蘭放棄但澤。那來，還有什麼可以表示的呢？不過當時英國民衆的壓力，實在太大了，速張伯倫首相這樣固執的人，也不能不屈服。然而，在他發表聲明的前夜，他還最後一决地勸吿波蘭考慮：把要發表的聲明原稿，先送給波蘭看。這時波蘭的態度，是倔强極了，她向英國說；發表聲明與否，是英國自己的事，發也好，不發也好，波蘭留給英國自己去考慮；不過波蘭要堅決地吿訴英國一句，萬一德國佔取但澤，波蘭一定開始軍事行動，縱使英·法·袖手不問，波蘭也在所不顧。</p>
<p>這裏所說，就是張伯倫首相後來終於發表出來的，對於但澤問題，英國竭力支持波蘭立塲的著名宜言。這個宜言一發，於是籠罩在但澤上空的戰雲立刻紛散了。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們應當注意到一個最聚要的一點，那是；張伯倫所最怕的，固然是德波眞會打了起來，把英法捲入漩渦；而比對這更怕得厲害的，却是德波的完全沆瀣一氣，狼狽爲奸起來，把蘇聯隔開去，然後德意波合起來，向英法要求平分殖民地。</p>
<p>今年春天，希特勒向伯克當面說過的；波蘭今天，已經是「一等强國」了，然而也和德·意·一樣，缺乏殖民地，所以她也應當列在「沒有殖民地的强國」一類之內，有權向英法要求殖民地和「生活空間」，不過有一個大前提，那是：先讓但澤併進德國去。</p>
<p>當時的談判，雖然沒有收到具體效果，但德波爲但澤而求得妥協的可能，是始終存在着的。甚至一直到英波公的成立之後，在波蘭的對於但澤問題的外交上，始終仍然是存在着兩面性，向英國·波蘭·說她絕對不放棄但澤，必要時準備一戰，絲亳無討論的餘地；但在德波間，對於但澤問題覓取妥協解決的交涉，事實上，一天也沒有停止過。這些，說明了些什麼呢？說明了縱使放棄但澤波蘭也要由自己自動，藉以取得代價，不願讓英法去做人情，轉獻德國：波蘭是鑒於慕尼黑會議的前車，不願蹈捷克的覆轍的。</p>
<p>這個所謂但澤問題，這樣醞釀下去，當然又會鬧出「危機」來的。而且德國的計劃，無論如何，要在九月紐倫堡國社黨大會的席上，作爲今年勝利的收穫之一，提出來報吿。所以這其間可以伸縮騰挪的期間，實在是非常短促了。於是英波間就趕緊及早開始了參謀部之間的談判，和英波借款談判。這兩個談判，本是履行英波公的裏規定。</p>
<p>對於前一個談判，英國軍事當局們，竭力主張及早得一結果；但波蘭的態度，却非常冷淡，她堅持要先行完成借款的談判。可是，英國張伯倫首相，却以完成借款談判爲工具，逼波蘭先同意英國對但澤問題解決的辦法。當然，張伯倫還想最近和德國再開談判的；那末，但澤問題，正又是一個大好的交換條件。不過直到目前爲止，波蘭仍然堅持絕拒英國過問但澤問題。所以這同時進行着兩個談判，就一齊陷入了半死半活的狀態。</p>
<p>英國今天大多數人士，都反對張伯倫這種做法。大前提，他們認爲對德妥協，愈弄愈糟，這麼弄下去，將來一定要引起戰爭，其决，他們認爲波蘭寗願借款不成，也不願英國過問但澤。所以萬一英波談判不成，德波轉而接近成功時，則那時英國的大患，將不堪設想了。法國的態度，也是這模樣，所以她不獨勸英國趕緊先完成借款談判，而且她目願完全履行對波諾言，先借六萬萬法郎給波蘭。</p>
<p>這些天來，張伯倫首相一事無成，受着國內外的責備，呈現了一種非常惱怒的狀態。他把失敗的責任，一齊放到國會和與論機關上去。他表示要不是英國國會裏的紛紛責問，以及報紙雜誌上的盡量揭載的話，他的秘密外交，特殊路綫，是可以成功的。所以他已經一面在打算着有什麼辦法，可以箝制輿論，並且打算命令閣員們，在國會答覆責問時，儘量不談國際事件了。但像英國這種民治空氣深濃的國家，這一切當然結果是徒勞而反會成爲笑柄。</p>
<p>不久後，國會的例定休會的期間又到了。聽說在這期間內，張伯倫抱着莫大希望打算再趁機會試一試他國際路綫的大手筆，我們目等着瞧吧。（七月二十一日）</p>

<p>從香港同輪到海防的旅客、經過兩天的萍水生活、大都很能談得來、相互之間、雖不能怎樣帮忙、但照料是辦得到的、所以我們在輸未到埠以前、大家便的定遇到檢查時、結成一個小團體、互相照顧、那些被打散的行李、籠岸以後、大件行李交旅行社、（因海防旅館生意太好、根本沒有接客上船兜攬）、一來旅行社接客時、對於海關的檢騐手續、較爲熟悉、而且是廣東人居多、言語上勉强能通、二來多一個人照應、檢驗時也可帮同整理、從輪埠到關棧（即待騐之處）一段、據說扒手最多、所以行李交給旅行社之後、本人仍須隨行、照以前的規則、行李和旅客入關棧以後、門窗全部關閉、靜候關員來查檢、有時確須等一二小時以上、遇到熱天、被關在伸手不見五指的房子裏、其苦况眞是够受的、現在已經變通辦法、上午到埠輪船的行李、下午二時後檢驗、下午的便到明天、其候檢的期間、行李鎖在關棧、旅客可在外面自由行動、檢騐時、人多手雜、情形極爲混亂、假使是一二人帶多件行李、的確不易照料、因爲每件行李必須放在檢騐台上打開、打開後、略爲翻動、（除有意和你過不去以外大多不會兜底倒翻）便須離檢騐台而搬出大門、决無從容整理的餘暇、同時連聲呼喝催促使旅客情緒、極度紊亂、宵小乃乘機活動、此時最好將團體內所有行李上的鎖完全打開、由一部份人留守待騐、此外的人、分做兩批、一部份人負責傳送、將拆散的行李送至關棧門外、一部份人在大門外擇一空地、專司保管送出的拆散行李、迨各人行李全部檢騐完畢、再着手整理、大致新貨而數量不多的、（二三件）都不會被扣上稅、火柴在越南由法政府專賣、以不帶爲是、帶了至多不過沒收、一根罰一塊錢、也祇在以前偶有發生、現在大多丟入他們特備的小抽屜便完事了、設遇新貨而數紫較多的、關員便提出放在一旁、此時留守待騐的人、應特別注意件數及擱置地點、以爲事後交涉發還的餘地、發還的成份很多、不過須善爲說辭、</p>
<p>最後附帶講上一點上稅的情形如帶有成打或大批的新貨仍以提出報關上稅爲妥、照越海關規定、國貨抽過境稅百分之一、西品百分之四、但非直接由中國領土運來一律照百分之四抽稅同時旅客隨身帶的現在也通融、一律祇抽百分之一、以前海防中國領事館設有旅客指導所、兼代鉀報關事務、現在已經停辦、所以如有大批貨物携帶過境、最好先在香港簽證處接洽、以免到了海防後多躭擱日子、（未完）</p>

<h3>敎部高敎司科長陳東原談如何選擇院系及學校（續四）經騐環境爲選擇標準爲不可少條件依照個人興趣而升學就業很有道理</h3>
<p>（二）個人的興趣、因爲個性的差異、各人對於世間事物的興趣、學問的或非學問的、往往不能相同、根據興趣來作選擇大學院系以及終生職業的標準、當然很有道理、這所謂興趣、並非純以學習興趣爲準、在中學時代對於某一學科有與趣、不能斷定即可爲終生的職業、本文第一節論到擅長學科的原則、對此已有解說、故在學科以外對於其他事悄之之興趣、亦足爲重要的參考例如學生在幼年時代或中學期間、喜歡做學生會長、喜歡演說、喜歡欣賞自然、喜歡報章雜誌上投稿、喜歡在實騐室做試騐、喜歡到圖書館看書、以及其他一切細瑣事情的興趣等等、每都與升學選系及終生事業有關、切不可等閒漠視、達爾文幼年時候喜歡玩昆虫、愛迪生幼年時候喜歡搜集舊機件、總理幼年時候喜歡打不平、這都是興趣的流露、、也就是性之所近的表現、成功的人物如此、普通的人也是如此、我個人的經騐、幼年時候、就喜歡邀集鄰兒、來家裏開學堂、回想起來、到現在還感覺與趣、你只要回想一下、你在幼年時代一定也有你的感覺興趣的玩藝兒、萬一你想不出來、多半是由於你的不留心、當然也有那沒有機會使你表現、因而未曾發現的、傳說王羲之家有一個婢女、做事笨到萬分、頗不爲家人所喜、有一天、王羲之到外面會客去了、書房裏有一張字沒有寫完、那婢女忽然觸動性靈、接上寫了幾個字、羲之回房一看、很是耍得、從此敎她練習寫字、不再輕視她了、所以後人說、王羲之家、沒有不會寫字的、人世間事業無窮、總有與你性情相近的事、大舉科系、亦是如此、如果你已發現對於某一種事有興趣、有時還不能單純的斷定就性近某科例如你在學校時、愛做學生會長、表面看去、很容易認爲宜於學政治、其實喜歡在小團體負責的人、雖宜於政治、也宜於學人事管理、宜於經營工商業、宜於做學校或機關的主持者、所以有許多與趣的表現、必須加以分析、並參考其他條件、纔能斷定你的性近何科的、</p>
<p>（三）經騐與環境、智慧與才能、須待啟發、方能發現、所以經騐與環境、是選擇院系不可少的條件、所謂經騐、就是個人已往的所學所行或所接觸的事情、對於文學經騐多的、宜於學文、對於科學經騐多的宜於學理、梁任公先生在二十歲前、就在萬木草堂讀了很多中國書籍、而允喜史書、所以後來他在史學上的貢獻特大、胡適之先生靑年時候特別愛看小說、所以後來倡導白話文學運動、一個人在年輕時候、因爲某種機會、接觸於某方面的學問較多、無形之中、情意受了他的影嚮、後來便會走到那一路上去、所以志願升學的靑年、務要體騐個人過去的經騐、某一學科的材料得的多些、便很可作爲他選擇院系一種重要參考、以言環境、家庭的背景、與所在的社區、都有很大關係、中國從前有所謂一書香門第、」「耕讀人家」、在從前「學優則仕」的社會、讀書與做官是聯帶的、讀書是做官的預備、做官是讀書的成果、父親做官、兒子讀書、兒子讀了書叉想做官、這「書香門第」一句話、一點都沒有錯、那時所讀的書簡單、不必耍有很多設備與實騐、所以讀與耕也極容易聯在一起、現在社會雖然已有了改變、但家庭的職業背影、與子弟升學前途、仍然是極有關係、求學固然人人有份、讀書不再是書香門第的專業、但是一個商業家庭的子弟、最好不要選擇文史哲敎或政治的學系、因爲學習文史哲敎與政治這些學科、其所需要的心胸氣魄、不是經商的家庭所可陶融出來的、勉强學了、也不能有好的造就、經商人家的靑年、儘可舉商業、學法律、學經濟、學醫、家庭背景與所習學科、總耍有相當配合、就同顏色鮮艷的衣服、並非每個女子都宜穿的一樣、宜於膚色白的人的顏色、每不宜於膚色黑的、勉强去穿、返不免於「東施效顰」了、家庭背景、與習學科之關係、不僅內在習性一點而已、將來出路也有關係、在某一種家庭、便學習某一種相近的院系、將來工作的機會、自然也容易些、我這種意見、並非說「士之子恒爲士」、工之子恒爲工」、管子弟子職一篇中、曾有過這樣的主張、在現今的時代、我並不以爲然、但個人的學科、不應與家庭職業相去太遠、我認爲是相當正確的、再則說到個人所在的社會環境、這一點也非常重要、一個生長在都市社會的人去學農業、他的成就、很難比在農村社會的人習學農業來的好、生長的社會中、所見所聞、已較豐富、而將來學畢之後、所遇的問題、所應做的事、自然還應在其所處的社會之中、所以選擇院系、也不能離開自己的社會太遠、</p>

<h3>游擊隊沿交通綫活躍　毀公路橋樑七座　橫林火車殘駭倒臥路旁　失蹤之日哨兵二斃一傷　返滬旅客所目擊</h3>
<p>大陸報云、據行經江蘇大部份游擊區之旅客返滬談、日軍當局在通此間租界之鐵路綫一帶、已取特殊戒備、以對抗游撃隊之活躍、日軍雖已戒備、然游擊隊於上星期仍極活動、毀壞橋樑、阻碍交通錢、炸毀火車及車輛、自蘇省東部來此之某外僑聲稱、京滬路與蘇嘉路區域內游擊隊</p>
<p>不時襲擊沿兩路一帶之日武裝衛兵數已大增、渠自常熟乘公共汽車至蘇州、沿路見橋樑七座、被游撃隊全毁或毀一部份、修理未畢時、架有臨時木橋、此事可使人知游擊隊</p>
<p>如何活躍因蘇州去常熟僅三十哩、其間諒有日僞軍愼防之、然游擊隊發能隨心所欲、焚燬或炸斷橋樑、而使交通大受阻碍也、另一外僑爲述上星期六日上海駛蘇州火車遭游擊隊轟炸之情形、據稱、渠原欲乘星期六日侵晨由滬駛出之火車、抵站尙早、惟購票遲緩、不得不搭翌晨之車、但此改期或已</p>
<p>救其一命渠次晨搭車抵蘇州附近之橫林、見隔昨駛出火車之殘骸、倒臥路旁、沿路各車站僅二三星期前猶不見日軍者、今已滿駐衛兵、火車抵蘇州時、許多旅客、均遭盤詰、並有若干人被搜査云、又一旅客自上海以西各鎮來者、談日兵在該地</p>
<p>近郊焚燒許多農舍事、據稱、七月廿九日日哨兵三名失蹤後、日兵卽行縱火、旋發現三哨兵中二名已斃、另一名身受槍傷甚重、倒臥道旁、日兵一隊奉令往該區搜索、據稱乃搜査狙擊日哨兵之游擊隊、但除身軀健壯、而他人認明爲普通農民之三人外、餘無所獲、上海郊外與滬西各鎮、近來迭有槍聲發作、</p>
<h3>本館修理電綫　誤觸警鈴</h3>

<h3>西婦法幣被抄　日方飾詞　謂限帶現鈔五百　適用於一切旅客</h3>
<p>字林報云、日方昨日（二日）招待新聞記者、有詢某西婦離天津時曾吾遭搜查、而被沒收其法幣、大使館發言人稱、搜查出入靑島或其他任何華北口岸之外籍旅客、可認爲正當之手續、而由負責軍官定取捨、旅客准携現鈔日金五百元入華北口岸、逾限須領匯票、此項規則自五月間起實行、適用於一切旅客、並不特別施諸英僑、</p>

<h3>四行奉令組委員會　管理國內匯兌　旨在防止內地資金外流　同時鼓勵滬市資金內移　上海是否設分會未確定</h3>
<p>肘政部爲統制國內匯兌業務、防止內地法幣外流、鼓勵資金流入內地、飭中中交農四行、組織國內匯兌管理委員會、防止內地資余外流、並鼓勵滬市資金內移、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>順滙逆匯　性質各異</p>
<p>匯兌者、即兩地間債權債務之消償、不以現金運送、而以一方之債權、償還他方債務、國內匯兌分「順匯」與「逆匯」、順匯由債務人交款於匯款行、托匯款行轉委其外埠之代理行、交款於債人以淸償其債務、故其匯款之主動、出於債務人、逆匯由債權人對債務人出一匯票、命令債務人付款於匯款行之外埠代理行、一面先將該匯票售於匯款行、取得現金、以收回其債權、其匯款之主動、出於債權人、</p>
<p>全國行莊　辦理通匯</p>
<p>銀行錢莊承做此種匯兌之先決條件、必於國內有外埠分支行之設立、尋常通匯地點、以設有分支行之所在地爲限、惟銀行亦可與外埠同業訂立通匯合同、如浙江地方銀行·江蘇農民銀行·江西裕民銀行等、均已彼此互相訂立合同通匯、惟各行莊之國內匯兌、均採用「順匯」、並分「信匯」·「條匯」·「電匯」·「票匯」·「活支匯款」·「旅行支票」、至於「逆匯」、大都於押匯時採用之、關於押匯、亦爲行莊業務之一、</p>
<p>設委員會　管理匯兌</p>
<p>中中交農四行、已奉財政部命令、組織國內匯兌管理委員會、實施管理國內匯兌業務、委員會設在重慶四行總行所在地、全國設立分會、附設在中中交農四行內、對由內地匯款至沿海淪陷區域、如上海等處、以購買日用必需品爲限、並應先向匯兌管委會申請、說明用途·數目·匯往地點、及買貨商號之證明文件、旨在防止內地資金之外流、</p>
<p>鼓勵資金　流入內地</p>
<p>此外並鼓勵資金之流入內地、中中交農四行、對由上海匯款至內地者、予以種種便利、規定匯款人內地者、無論何地、一律免收匯費、祇收手續費每千元國幣一元、並得以上海通用之匯劃票據付給之、而內地得領用十足之現鈔、如以津魯漢地名之鈔票、委託中交匯到內地者、除免費外、並不收手續費、自實行以來、由上海匯款至內地者激增、</p>
<p>嚴格限制　內地匯滬</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、上海係淪陷區域之一、故毋須設立國內匯兌管委會、至於由內地匯滬之款、依目前情形而言、如昆明·重慶·等地、現鈔約一千四百元、合申地一千元、且內地匯款爲現鈔、上海領款者爲匯劃、自國內匯兌管理委員會成立後、由內地匯滬之款、非經國內匯兌管理委員會之審查核准、不得委託行莊或郵局承匯、對於匯滬之款、特別嚴格、</p>
<p>上海分行　僅備查詢</p>
<p>據銀行界消息管理會總會、的在週內即可開始工作、至於上海方面、據咋晚本報記者向銀行界負責人探詢、據悉上海四行方面、對此尙未奉到總行正式命令、故上海是吾將設立分會、現尙未能確定、該負責人觀察此舉性質、其主旨爲防止內地資金外流、故對於由重慶等處滙款來滬、施以嚴格之管理、換言之、凡經重慶等內地之國內滙兌管理會總分會之核准、許其滙款來滬者、則上海分行自當照付、故其審核准滙與否、純在內地各總分會、上海方面、則僅備總分會之查詢、現上海四行分行、正靜候總行命令、再行遵照辦理、該負責人並稱政府對於上海資金轉滙內地、發展內地生產、手續上仍極便利云、</p>
<h3>牛隻軍滬被阻</h3>
<p>四郊牛隻運入租界、現爲僞方所阻、前日浦東東昌路有宰牛十餘頭、正擬渡浦運進孤島、但被攔阻回去、昨日上午、南碼頭又有宰牛八頭、正擬過浦、叉爲僞「水警隊」扣留、並將人牛押送僞「司法分科」、至晚未釋、</p>
<h3>滬西恐怖份子　被意防軍繳械　昨晨形勢緊張險起衝窘態　但經意軍懾服拘廿六人</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、白利南路五角塲今（三日）晨形勢緊張、因持械恐怖份子、聞係擁護汪精衛之「特務團」團員、在極斯非而路一〇八一號屋字外幾與意陸戰隊起衝突也、該屋前爲萬國商團華人隊司令部、今有曹義小學設其中、據非正式消息稱、恐怖份子計四五十人、若輩公然在該屋憑牆反抗意防軍、但終屈服、而被</p>
<p>解除武裝</p>
<p>押入意軍軍用卡車一輛、載往意軍司令部、官方消息謂共拘押二十六人、抄獲軍用盒子砲及大批武器、叉據目擊者稱、並有大批手溜彈裝人力車一輛、在護送下載往意軍司令部、聞恐怖份子係自極斯非而路七十六號總部、前陳調元宅中派出者、而該總部不久前設億定盤路某屋、近始遷極斯非而路七十六號、且衆信此輩</p>
<p>恐怖份子</p>
<p>即近在中美日報及大晚報行暴之暴徒、今展九時甫過、突在極斯非而路一〇八一號外出現、計四五十人、或御長袍、或衣西服、均持利刃·軍用盒子砲·及手溜彈、其中一人入曹義小學、謂若輩將改是屋爲總部、勒令該校於九日之內遷出、據目擊者稱、「大道」警察對此輩恐怖份子甚恭、見之無不</p>
<p>意軍當局</p>
<p>得訊、乃派意陸戰隊急馳到場、或謂意兵有二百名之多、而官方則謂五十名、將該屋包圍、而令恐怖份子屈服、恐怖份子不從、憑墻出軍用盒子砲示威、雙方僵持至十一時三十七分、恐怖份子卒屈服、當時</p>
<p>形勢緊張</p>
<p>附近店舖均亟閉門、路中除少數好奇之旁觀者外、幾無行人、</p>
<p>又訊、意兵所拘獲者、共十六人、嗣查明爲「大道」市政府職員、已於昨日午後四時左右悉予開釋矣、</p>
<h3>全滬胃氣痛之保障　首推陳家胃痛膏　無論新久胃痛貼之立癒　一經貼癒永無復發之患</h3>

<h3>市塲籌碼活潑　行莊存款激增　滙劃票據制度已收宏效　四行辦理貼放餘額尙鉅</h3>
<p>滬市金融穩定逾恒</p>
<p>銀行聯合準備委員會、辦理同業領用匯劃後、各行莊均提供財產、準備向該會領用、該會視各行莊實際需要、評定担保品價格、並按照評價額百分之七十、準各行莊領用匯劃、钱業公會會員錢莊、共認定領用一千萬元、已經公會審査完竣、將各莊認領數目送交銀行準備會、各商業銀行之認領數目、亦已假定、中中交三銀行、因統一公債到期本息改付匯劃、於是匯劃票据流通數量激增、是項匯劃付款機關、均已集中於銀行凖備委會、</p>
<p>市塲增加　現鈔籌碼</p>
<p>銀錢兩業公會爲調劑同業之資金、藉以支付五百元以下之法幣存款起見、商請中中交三行之同意、將各行莊於六月底止存於銀錢業凖備會庫之匯劃款二千二百萬元、分十二偭星期掉成法幣、以資週轉、自七月四日起實行後、每星期的一百八十萬元、至八月一日爲止、已掉出五期、計法幣九百萬元、即市塲上已增加法幣籌碼九百萬元、各行莊均遵照前商定之辦法、向凖備會庫支取法幣、聞第六期已定八月八日支付、</p>
<p>四行繼續　辦理貼放</p>
<p>中中交農四銀行爲謀內地金融農礦工商各業資本之流通起見、遵照財政部命令、設立四行聯合貼放委員會後、貼放範圍、分（一）抵押、（二）轉抵押、（三）貼現、（四）放款、自實行之後、頗收成效、關於上海之貼放委員會、仍繼續辦理貼放工作、至上月底截止、聞放款餘額、的有一千四百萬元、惟此後之貼放、均由銀錢兩業公會轉手、該會公佈之（一）貼現率七厘半、（二）放款息二角半、始終並無變動、則足證上海令融市塲之穩定、</p>
<p>金融市塲　已趨穩定</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、上海金融市塲已趨穩定、例如黑市外匯轉鬆、黃金價格低落、證券暗市猛漲、匯劃貼水回降、錢業拆息以及銀行凖備會各種利率、鮮有變動、關於各行莊之提存風潮、完全平息、自本星期起、行莊存款、反見增加、雖馬電規定提存辦法、而存戶提取者大减、各行莊對過剩資金之運用、經考慮之後、均已决定方法、　近匯款入內地者激增、而投機交易、亦較前減少、此實爲滬市之好現象、</p>
<p>管理外滙　良好建議</p>
<p>昨據金融某鉅子談、外匯影響、原因有二、（一）外商銀行當匯價縮短、不應再行給予、質言之、即俗稱有行無市、（二）黑市人心浮躁、故作玄虛、企圖投機、反予日方扒進機會但據本人意見、中樞旣定有完善計劃、於施行以前、應儘量採納民意、作爲補充辦法、最妥善方式、滬市方面不必再給予各業外匯逕改由重慶方面中中交三行總行愼重給予、重慶爲統理機關、香港三行分行對外接洽處所、凡有核准給予數額、香港應聽命於重慶總行之指示、倘如此辦法實行、不論奸人任何奸計、亦絕無施展之機會、</p>
<h3>傳浙當局已準　開放鰲江</h3>
<p>惟江水頗淺狹　大輪不能進口</p>
<p>浙東溫州方面航綫、原有甌江、鰲江·楚門·平陽·等江、戰前均由國輪行駛、自八一三後、當局為加強防務、故將鰲江口等亦仍絕對禁航外、聞已允變通將離甌江口百餘里之鰲江口開放、准許外輪通航、由該處可轉達平陽楚門及溫州、惟該江口水道淺狹、僅一千五百噸以下之船隻、如寶利海福等方可行駛、聞航商方面、刻正辦理登記手續、以便行駛、</p>
<p>滬輪滯鎭</p>
<p>遠東哈納輪、於二日早晨自滬開鎭海、中意德平輪、於昨晨開鎭海、現留鎭海者、有寶利輪（義華洋行）度過主輪（禮和船務部）等四艘、</p>
<p>鎭海駁運</p>
<p>現在寗波防守部、對婦孺出口、已不限制、壯丁能具二千元舖保、限期二星期返甬者、亦准出口、至自滬赴甬者、更無任何限制、以故進出旅客、驟然增加、如上班謀福輪來滬、載有旅客二千餘人、以故駁運船隻、大為不敷、航輪泊鎭、時間頗有躭擱、</p>
<h3>繼史沫特萊而後　美女作家赴前綫</h3>
<p>讚譽晉陜五萬學生之工作　從事政治組織與游擊戰術</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國女作家賀摩女士、去年十一月來滬、轉赴中國內地、歷時九閱月、女作家來華赴前綫者、史沫特萊而後，以賀女士爲第一人、頃已返抵上海、昨（六日）向記者談稱、渠隨蕪湖敎會之白朗醫師取道溫州入內地、經南昌至桂林、遇大轟炸、旋抵重慶、隨金陵大學洛埃博士乘卡車經西安而至延安、聞鄭州難民情况不佳、乃自西安循黃河畔之隴海路而行、日軍向洛陽與鄭州間龜轟、惟途中人民頗衆、</p>

<p>對於呼嘯而過爆裂於一二哩外之砲彈、甚至不予一顧、賀女士熱烈長談渠赴晋省黃河東岸附近閻錫山將軍秘密司令部之經過、據稱、如謂中國學生並無所爲、純屬戲言、晋陝兩省中今有五萬學生、攻習政治組織與游擊戰術、其訓練程仿延安之紅軍學校、而無延安學生之激烈思相、惟</p>
<p>更重實際</p>
<p>從事優良之工作、此輩學生、係歷盡干辛萬苦、自全中國前往、到達時甚形困頓、但不久即恢復矯健之生活、晉陜人民頗多穴居者、鄕野廣博、山岡起伏村落罕見、惟人口衆多、農作稀少、而食物並不短缺、閻氏部下食糧豐足、從事山岳戰、旅者在途、必需品無慮匱乏、惟該區亟需救濟款項·醫藥人員·與藥物、農民組織擔架隊、</p>
<p>載送傷兵醫院設山穴中、惟缺少外科設備、晋省西南部已絕無一路可通、日軍重配備之運輸便利、已盡加破壞無遺、臨汾某醫校、已在黃河西岸設總部、學生二百人、盡其所能而工作、附近軍用醫院、均受其益、賀女士在晋省所見最可驚異之地、爲吉縣二度失陷·焚燬·克復、而後重建、渠</p>
<p>至吉縣時日軍雖在二十哩外、而該縣已在第三决重建中、六月間、賀女士抵延安、原擬赴北平、旋作罷、八路軍撥卡車一輛送渠至西安、赴渝途中、經過新生活運動會爲無家可歸者所建之模範村甚多、村中人均係自立者、留渝時、見美國救濟團體將在美募得之款項、救濟孤兒與難民、抵渝一二日後、電慶遭夜襲，賀女十並見劇烈空戰、旋乘飛機抵香港、轉道來滬、</p>

<h3>受原料漲價影響　工業復蘇又遭挫折</h3>
<p>原料來自國外者產量均減縮　漲價影響銷路不如脫售存料工部局工業科七月份報吿云、本市工業復蘇之高峯、似已過去、蓋一方面因時令關係、若干種工業之出品、不無減少、一方面復以限制提存、外滙緊縮、原料缺乏、以及海口封鎖等等、在在足以影響工廠產額、蘇州河以北各工廠、其出品推銷於揚子江下游各地、故所受影響較輕、惟就工業之全體而言、其所遭受之最大困難、則為原料之漲價也、製造日用品之工廠、其原料來自國外者、如橡皮鞋廠（原料四分之三購自國外、）琺瑯廠（原料十分之七購自外埠）、捲煙廠、熱水瓶廠、及玻璃廠等、產額　見減縮、自外滙首决緊縮以後、各工廠曾一度提高貨品售價百分之十至百分之十五不等、但其後因鑒於再度漲價勢必影響銷路、不得不實行減工或停工耳若千廠家在外匯暴縮以前、購有原料者、不願製造貨品、寗將原料脫售侔利、結果勢將平添失業工人也、</p>
<p>鋸木工廠</p>
<p>因溫州及浙東各埠木材無法採辦、重以進口木料、成本高漲、其營業前途之淸淡、不難想見、麵粉廠因目前小麥存底充足、當可維持出品、調味粉廠因出貨行銷外洋、故營業良好本埠現有繅絲廠四十六家、於繭汛前曾一度開工、但將來無意復業者、爲數頗多、鮮繭到稀價昂、彼打繅組絲以供本埠需求者、吃虧較重、但裝有新式繅絲設備、其生絲行銷國外市塲者、營業稍有把握、上月間經工業科派員作初步視察之工廠、計共五十八家、大半設於東區、</p>

<p>汽壓機器</p>
<p>中請登記編號之鍋爐、共四十八具、經發出之裝置檢騐證書計二十九張、上月間、由專家證明監督之汽壓機器、共有一〇七具有檢騐員一人、曾於已往兩月間、將工業科編定之正式號碼、蓋於鍋爐一二五具之上、此種手續、可使各該鍋爐所有人、明瞭維持其鍋爐之重要、某工廠所裝鍋爐一具、因工程師二人證明爲易生危險、經工部局禁止使用、以致該廠不得不暫行停工、上月製造鍋爐廠實行申請登記者計兩家、允申請登記者計六家、</p>
<p>意外事件</p>
<p>上月間經報吿之職業上與工業上之意外事件、共計一七〇起、內有致命者十二起、婦女死亡者一名、受傷者十二名、出事原因之經確實知悉者一四六起、經詳細調查者五十一起、六依照原因分類、因電力機器發生之事件最多、凡四十二起、致命者四起、因電氣而受傷之工人九名、不治身死者四名、因镕化、高熱或有腐蝕性之物體而受傷之工人八名、不治身死者四名、依照工業分類、以發生於紡織業者為最多、工廠內之火警計十八起、幸無人死傷、</p>
<p>勞資糾紛</p>
<p>經工業科注意之勞資糾紛、計有六起、發生於印刷業及電池業者各一起、未經工業科調停、即吿解決、橡皮廠一家宣告停工、其工人二七〇名、會函請工部局予以救濟、旋由廠方允以款項付與難民救濟協會、爲該會收容若輩工人及其家屬給養之用、另一起發生於某捲烟廠、該廠解雇女工一〇〇名、因此發生糾紛、結果由廠方發給退職金、工業科擬將若輩在受初步訓練之後、送入紗廠作工、裝釘作與麵粉廠搬運工人、各因要求增加工資、罷工一次、</p>
<p>工人待遇</p>
<p>有紗廠若干家、鑒於工一人生活困難、已提高其待遇、設於西區者數家、視米價之上落而定增加工資之數額、發給固定數額之津貼之工廠、亦有數家、</p>
<p>生活指數</p>
<p>七月份之生活費指數、又見增高、與一九三六年相比、增加幾達一倍、換言之、一九三角有奇、六七兩月份之各類指數比較、食物類漲百分之九·五六、房租類漲百分之四·六七、燃料類漲百分之五·五八、雜項類漲百分之〇·四六、惟衣着類略見減低、</p>

<p>自經兩租界當局嚴厲執行限價、並懲　抬價米商後、一時市塲情形、頗爲安穩、詛料一般投機囤戶及奸商、仍不顧民食、竟大做暗盤、因市塲上捕房探員、監視森嚴、恐密秘洩出、僅接洽交易數量、而其價格則山買賣雙方直接論定、不經市塲、據大光社記者探悉、連日以暗盤做成之市價、最高者已達二十三兀以上、昨日又復暗漲四五角、其他如各路客秞、原定最高價爲十六元、現已超越十八元以上十九元以下之間、此種情形、顯然操縱無疑、亟盼當局斷然處置、以維滬市五百餘萬人口之民食、</p>

<h3>日方陰謀以　偽幣付稅　但法幣無法摧毀　獲外匯亦不可能</h3>
<p>大陸報云、本埠某金融專家昨（二日）晤記者時聲稱、日方擬定在上海區中完全消除法幣之流通、而逐漸以　華興」幣取代之計劃、乃日本爲博取此間金融覇權而奮鬥之着手點、星期一日宣佈此間重要日方銀行六所以官定六便士滙兌「華興」幣乃日方排擠法幣出市塲的計劃之最近步驟、前傳此間日本商行今後以此偽幣發給僱員、近又宣佈本市日方</p>
<p>控制區內</p>
<p>之租費賦稅與官僚、將以「華興幣付給、益信日方已開始其陰傷法幣之深謀計劃、再「華興」幣之流通額於七月十六日將近百萬元、而於七月三十一日該行宣佈已達一百四十萬元、就日政府而言、日軍目前之政策、似屬片面獨行者、七月十四日法幣跌價後不久、聞統制「華興銀行」之日本興亞院與日太藏省因僞銀行之前途事而起衝突、大藏省欲僅用「虹口幣」爲</p>
<p>獲得外滙</p>
<p>之方法、謂法幣滙價雖跌、仍作爲「內幣」、而普遍使用、興亞院則反對之、主張强迫流通「華興」幣、而與法幣立即斷絕一切關係、但雙方均同意定「華興」幣價於六便士、使僞幣率在此間操覇權之另一步驟、爲某數方面日人主張强迫用「華興」幣繳納一切關稅、但東京對此已加吾認、關於日軍將吾至無法可施時仿傚天津而封鎖上海一節、咋日</p>
<p>衆意分歧</p>
<p>或指稱、日軍在華北之苛酷手段、不足逐法幣出外人租界、惟此决英日妥洽內包括承認「日人在侵佔區由特殊情况而起之需要」者、其勢力或將被施諸本埠局勢云、橫濱正金銀行昨日答覆本埠某外國銀行是否照規定價格購買華興」幣之問　稱稱、不知其事、</p>
<h3>長江下游航運　經營不易　外輪繼續航行　犧牲在所不惜</h3>
<p>揚子江自中日軍興後、江陰江面封鎖、航路斷絕、航運停頓、華商輟業、洋商改駛下游、即靖江縣屬之新港·新生港·張黃港·東界港、南通縣之天生港·姚港、及海門·啟東·崇明·等各口岸、在</p>
<p>過去半年</p>
<p>以上、該路航運異繁盛、蘇北亦賴以疏通、故在最盛時期中、行駛上述各口之輪船、共有二三十艘之多、但該項公司之組織、大半均係門外漢、當時因內地貨物、均集中於以上各口岸、客家祇求貨物之裝出、對運費均不論、因此生意非常容易、獲利甚多、自本年</p>
<p>六月一日</p>
<p>起、日軍藉口軍事時期、限制航行、阻撓外輪、航業逐漸下落、行駛新港·新生港·張黃港·東界港之各輪、相繼停航、日商遂加輪航行、雖英商怡和·太古·兩公司、爲維持航權計、仍派同和·武林·兩輪行駛、但往來之貨物全無、乘客亦祇由滬開往、略有數十或百餘不等、自新港等處回滬者</p>
<p>竟無一人</p>
<p>兩公司不惜犧牲、繼續航行、惟班期有時略爲延長，同和輪於咋日下午返滬、原定今晨出口、因修理鍋爐、現改於下星期二（八日）晨、開往新港太古武林輪、今日下午可到、明晨六時續開新港、德商亦祇凱司登·海康·潞安·等數艘、貨運甚爲慘淡、乘客略較英輪爲多、聞</p>
<p>日輪營業</p>
<p>亦殊平平、其最大這原因、爲內地游擊隊不准貨物輸出、日方亦無可奈何、崇明航路、完全由日商覇佔、祇日淸公司派浙江·慶寗·兩輪獨航、該兩輪係前市輪渡之渡輪所改、海門啟東一綫、日輪行駛較少、貨運略較起色、因船隻較多、如欲　利、</p>
<p>恐亦甚難</p>

<h3>大都會遷讓之訟　恒業公司敗訴　旣經加租忽又要求遷讓　違反地上權上訴遭駁回</h3>
<p>戈登路五十六號大都會花園舞廳之土地、原仍向普益地產公司所租賃、月租七百金、並不訂定期限、乃租賃之後、大都會即投資十餘萬元、在該土地上建築舞廳、佈置花園、及租賃後的三年、至去年四月、該土地由普益公司轉讓與英商恒業地產公司經租自恆業</p>
<p>經租之後</p>
<p>即於本月一日通知大都會、自本年一月一日起租金增加爲每月八百五十元、大都會方面爲恐免受遭加租危險、故與恒業商訂三年之定期契的、談判將成之際、恒業方面突吿中止談判、一面更通知大都會方面、於本年四月五日起大都會須將租地上之建築物拆除、回復原狀、終止租賃契的、大都會除遵照加租之規定</p>
<p>照付租金</p>
<p>外、對於終止租約一點、表示異議、恒業方面乃向特一法院對大都會舞廳提起終止租約之訴、而大都會經理江耀章即委任陳霆銳律師抗辯、謂原吿方面旣通知加租於先、經被吿照辦之後、忽又要求拆屋遷讓、回復原狀、如此出爾反爾、顯見另有作用、照原被兩造名義上所訂者、似爲租賃契的、但實際被吿所租者爲一空地、而由大都會投資於該土</p>
<p>地上建築</p>
<p>房屋、故實係民法上之地上權關係、查地上權之規定、須欠租達二年以上、方得解的、今大都會根本不欠租分文、焉得解約、故請駁回原吿之訴、經審判結果、判決將原告之訴駁回、而恒業方面奉判不服、向高二分院提起上訴、乃在上訴進行中、大都會方面即獲得一重要之證據、該證據係恒業公司致前大都會股東戴祖文（已拆股）者</p>
<p>催繳地租</p>
<p>一千六百元、而該租即大都會現在之土地也、該信上註明此項地租、乃根據本年一月二十四日所訂之契的、由此可見此决恒業之興訟、其背景即在於此、因恒業圖多得每月數百金之月租、不惜犧牲他人之利益、故於上訴開庭時、陳霆銳律師即將此證據提出、以證明上訴人訴訟之目的、實有背交易上誠實信用、以恒業公司如此舉動</p>
<p>顯屬不當</p>
<p>故應請駁回上訴人之上訴、並另負担二審之訴訟費用此案業經高二分院審訊終結、已於一時宣吿判決、將恒業公司之上訴駁回、訴訟費用由上訴人負祖、</p>

<h3>金融外匯平靜</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、俱無榮辱、英美匯暗市、因日銀行績來吐塞、加以英行有利（代津幫）暨華行等亦來斬多、致潛勢初時頗鬆、一度英金會硬達四辦士半、美匯亦會鬆至八元七五、嗣因匯豐銀行對於英金四辦士半仍有無限吃胃、致被阻撓、入後又加日行正金突來復進、故市勢遂逐步回軟、結果軋無幾、聞三時許英美匯均回至上日收價、而本月期貨初時緣外行吃胃呆淡、是以情勢更鬆、英金一度會硬至四辦士三七五、美匯銀行亦會還過八元四三七五、後因西商沙遜與化商趁賤扒吸、故為狀稍回、終則英尚軋硬〇六二五、美亦軋長一二五、於是掉期更形軋攏、照晚收英金相差一七一八七五、美匯距離三七五、約合月息除佣四分五厘強、而實際上套利者衹多貼進美金二五、約合月息除佣僅三分光景、故套利交易隱滅、其他交易尚旺、</p>
<p>晨市賣風甚熾</p>
<p>晨初倫敦大條近遠期均縮一二五、紐約銀價呆定、倫敦生金仍無上落、匯兌英對美勿動、對滬大〇六二五、對法長一生丁、美對英未更、對滬升一角、對法仍平、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士〇六二五、美匯八無五九三七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後因日銀行界及英行有利等賣與殊濃、兼華行亦未脫售、至市勢步硬、計日行與有利及華行等相繼塞予外行荷蘭某行現化英金四辦士四三七五及四六八七五、繼而華行又與日行賣予安達運通荷蘭現貨美匯八元六二五及六八七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉均無變化、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免徵、此後有利又來賣予匯豐現貨英金四辦士半、同時美匯亦硬至八元七五、時華行又塞予外行本月份英金由四辦士三一二五、鬆至三七五、同時本月份美匯外行亦會還過八元四三七五、將近午刻、英商沙遜突來趁賤扒吸、計結進外行本月份美匯為八元三七五、是以為狀稍回、時外行現貨匯賣價約三十元〇五角、似稍帶硬、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯八元六八七五、本月份英金四辦士二五、美匯八元二八一二五、</p>
<p>結果軋長無幾</p>
<p>後市因日行突來復進、致山勢回軟、計正金結時外行現貨英金四辦士四三七五、並現貨美匯八元六五六二五、入後華商扒結外行本月份美匯八元二五、延至晚收銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四二一八七五、美匯八元六二五、（聞三時後英金又軟至四辦士〇六二五、美匯亦緊至八元五九三七五、）本月份英金四辦士二五、美匯八元二五、結果比上日現貨英微硬〇一五六二五、美略鬆〇三一二五、本月份英績賤〇六二五、美又硬二五</p>
<p>香港匯市平穩</p>
<p>香港三日電、今日匯市開盤半隱　英美各匯不動、中匯降三元、為三百十十七元、至後收均無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津申匯不動</p>
<p>天津三日電、今日匯市、開盤疲軟、對美鬆三七五、為三便士八七五、對美長半元、為七元五六二五、申匯不動、仍為一百十十元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤一元五角、為一百〇三元、</p>
<h3>現金欲跌又止</h3>
<p>昨日現金暗盤趨勢飄忽、大致先狂跌、後則暴漲、結果無榮辱、全視外匯緊鬆及買賣勢為轉移、初開因外匯報硬、兼證券幫賣意頗切、加以進者躊躇不前、致一時缺乏維持、一度撳小至三千五百三十元低盤、嗣以外匯止鬆稍回、引起買風、一般搶帽子者均來爭前吸收、價乃回上至三千五百八十五元、午刻因有當日獲利者趁高了結、重復下挫、逗留於三千五百五十元關邊、入後因外匯已見回平、買風重起、某金號代華南幫吸收頗力、加之投機商脫手者重來復進、市勢頓堅、迨至晚收竟回高至三千六百元、全天交易、零多　少、共約七八百兩、銀樓飾金亦隨之先跌而後回平、海關金與中英純金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤一無上落</p>
<p>自晨第條（十兩）初開、因外匯報硬、人心更疲、進者觀望、開市即猛撳四十元、某金號賣予銀樓幫十兩、三千五百六十元、開後證劵幫力塞數十兩、因買戶頗缺、績向下疲、一雯時竟傾跌三十元、證劵幫賣予銀樓幫三十兩、三千五百三十元為當日最低價、時某現金號與某金號（代投機商）趁低吸收、卻回高三十元、某現金號進錢兌業三十兩、三千五百六十元、此後聯外匯已止鬆稍回、目證劵幫亦來吸納、又漲二十五、某金號進錢兌業十兩、三千五百八十五元、其時某金號（代投機商）忽止進、獲利出範、兼錢兌業績來拋塞、市象重疲、回小三十五元、證劵幫售予錢兌業二十兩、價三千五百五十元、午刻證劵幫又吐予某銀號二十兩、為三千五百五十二元作午收價、午後初開尚平、首由現金號塞予錢兌業十兩、三千五百五十元、繼而證劵幫售予某銀號十兩、三千五百五十元、此後突起劇烈漲風、蓋外匯為狀轉軟、且某金號代華南幫猛吸不休、加以加一金號代投機商與證劵幫亦復起買風、飛漲五十五元、銀樓幫賣予金號五十兩、三千六百元作晚收價、聞收後三千六百〇五元有進者而無賣戶之說、結果較上日一無上落、全天七十元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮聞做開、</p>
<p>飾金先小後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百六十五元、迨至九時三十七分掛小五元、下午二時四十五分回高五元、結果無軒輊、大同行仍懸三百六十五元、新同行為三百六十三元、收售的成低上餘元至念元不等、</p>
<h3>英美金票堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、英美金鎊、供給稀少、市況穩定、金票需要甚殷、亦見上升、香港票供給稀、市價微升、坎拿大斐律潛票、需要殷煩、存貨稀少、且美金票堅俏、追隨挻秀、日金票復呈頹勢、晚市為一元零五分、朝鮮票晚市為八角七分八釐、公會交易甚暢、仁泰出祥康進香港票一千五百元、又出勤泰進美金票二百元、又出長泰進美金票二百元、永豐出晉大進美金票二百元、又出勤泰進美金票三百元、茂豐出長泰進美金票三百元、昨日市價、英金票升三角、美金票升一角五分、香港票升一分、坎拿大升四角、斐律濱票升三角、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>匯劃貼現有升降</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、復見回跌、每千元初即破入二百元內、盤於一百九十元左右、繼更不支、步低至一百七十五元、午刻復又上升至一百九十元、下午趨平、最後略退至一百八十五元、較之前日最後價、回落二十五元、錢業公會拆息仍未更、早午兩市均掛二角云、</p>
<h3>證劵內債漲風稍息</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況高而復低、連漲五日、至此乃覺稍斂、買賣陣綫、初則多方繼績吸收、以大豐買進甲種為多、益中松茂進胃亦不弱、丙種會抬至四十四元、大豐乃轉出丙種、二十號卅五及六十四號供出極湧、丙乙種一瀉幾及一元、當時進戶極稀、散戶稍有抵補、而富春仍有售出、收盤時毫無精彩、趨勢當有轉變、市價結果、除乙種微小一角五分外、餘尚略好二角至四角、成交總數約計三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後（倫敦外債行市無變動）</p>
<p>股票南洋烟草股成交四十股、價八元三角五分、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票行市本月二日（週三）掛牌行市、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌半鎊、價為七十四鎊、又香港註冊股升半鎊、價為七十七鎊、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　日紗下跌　投機買風消釋</h3>
<p>紗市漲風巳戰、良以外匯基礎日堅、市場投機買風、漸漸消釋、惟囤戶心思仍濃、如遇低落時、仍來吸收積藏、至於實需、華面採辦、繼績不懈、就目下狀況如無意外變化、紗市恐有一度徘徊也、不過日紗市況、亦轉下挫矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開平平、客方亦無亟亟辦貨、兼之空氣綏和、一般進進出出者較為減色、故開盤與上日無甚變遷、二十支雙馬外棧貨為五百八十七元、棧單為五百七十一元、少頃香港幫稍有採辦舉動、且二十支特金城價仍為六百九十元、市況緊俏雙馬外棧貨五百九十元、棧單五百七十四元、收盤稍回一二元、永安廠開出二十支特金城八十包為六百九十元、十支特金城十包、六百四十元、查半日成交統計　千三百二十五包、上日成交二百包、行情二十支雙馬跌二元、牧羊跌一元、其他勿動、各幫買去額量列左、香港　五五五　同行　六〇〇　內地　一七〇　統計一三二五</p>
<p>日紗市面轉入平疲之途、因連朝猛騰、稍現反動之象、此亦意中事也、二十支月琴下月價為四百六十元、下跌亦速、</p>
<h3>印棉同業廉價出售交易異常繁旺</h3>
<p>本棉交易之稀貴、猶如鳳毛麟角、僅元一號進一百二十件、但印棉生意、益覺發展、華商永安廠紛紛採辦、共計一千六百件、均係同業現鈔售出、新生紗廠亦有納胃、其他同行中互相買賣、依然活躍、轉輾抵解日廠為多數、棉價異常堅定、且見前進之勢、查市上行情、較洋行直接向海外之訂價、要廉宜十餘元、號家亦銀根頭寸關係、賤價求售也、蘇北來源僅通花六十五包、茲將現棉情形錄左</p>
<p>大批印棉今日到滬、大英公司Jeypore號由孟買裝來棉花三千二百十一噸、約一萬餘件、定今晨七時到埠、預定靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易日來雖略轉機、惟是項原棉、衹限於各同業之手貨、因彼等之價、較之洋行定價尚廉二十餘元、日來主要買戶、仍為日廠商、付款條件、因銀根關係、均屬出貨二週後也、彼等存底稀薄、聞存棉尚不足供三四週之用也、如此交易若能維持一週、則各同業之手貨將均被吸收一空、則同業又將以高價向洋行方面訂購矣、故按照此種局面、外棉交易、尚有向榮之日矣、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日價較形疲之、開盤尚稱堅定、後棉區報告忽傳良好、及市上缺乏主要買戶、華盛街在市套賣亦頗猛烈、南方現貨交易靜寂、同業多頭獲利了結、直至最後竟以最低價收盤、結果較之上日跌十至八磅音、印度亦呈疲乏之情、昨日連同預測跌一羅比又半、埃及漲三五磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭華廠趕交定貨工作復忙</h3>

<p>東疋　昨白貨市面實岑寂、售盤回疲、獨龍頭細布投機活躍、乍升乍降、本月份最高盤做開每疋十六元八九角、低盤降至十六元五元、後市又升至十六元七角半、下月份期貨為十七元二角、其他陽鶴·五福·喇叭童等細布、則一致下挫一角至一角半、而細斜較為平穩、天津幫前進細布略有轉出、本街染廠進額不多、僅恃同業中之心思生意、成交六七百件、但行方開價仍較市盤為昂、伊數訂出九月份龍頭細布一百數十件、價十七元五角、</p>
<h3>糧食　米糧場外買賣異常猖獗　成交約達平底鍋倍餘厚粳廿三元出零</h3>
<p>杜米、因店積久虛、暢辦不懈、然以避免限價制裁、市場反無交易、聞場外則頗有成交、厚粳價已有二十三元出零及高尖十九元之說、昨下無到頭、楓涇來車輪包子一千三四百包、人心高昂、市面一再上漲、果將伊於胡底耶、至場內交易、計開客尖次熱十六元、及砶米十六元、變元二十二元半、香港糯、一十三元、總共二千餘包、而場外成交、較場上約有三倍之餘、</p>
<p>客秈　昨市更混亂、高客秈售價須逾限二三元、中次提高三五七八角不等、高砶米亦須逾限四五角、開十六元以內者、衹次砶與糙米而已、但本街納胃仍貪、十七元之次秈均見繞辦一空、關二三元之大市機米尤形活潑、貨方尚不肯儘單售出云、</p>
<p>麪粉　零交活躍、客幫屢要求廠盤以劃論價、而廠方除一度允開六元匯劃之特價外、仍以貼現升降條忽、拒開匯劃統市成交約有三萬餘包、二號紛廠盤仍須五元現鈔、開回範貨與廠盤相差低五分至一角、</p>
<p>小麥　京滬津浦兩路、新麥日有二三十車、華日廠均思進取、惟吃盤甚苛、昨市福新阜豐兩廠及囤戶均有購辦、市面又緊數分至角許、統市由廠辦舊湖六合浦鎮暨無錫等麥共六七車、價為六元六七角、又囤戶收辦南京昆山蘇州無錫用管店等麥共計十一車、價七元〇八分至六元六角三分、</p>
<h3>糖市車白小三四角</h3>

<h3>不可能的「一個通貨計書」</h3>
<p>— 謝菊會</p>
<p>因為外匯暗市的一再低落，匯市波動的愈見劇烈，於是七月二十二日的字林西報上面，便來了一篇「一個通貨計書」的社論。據說許多方面意見，認為目下正是工部局着手調查發行它自已貨幣的方法的時候。其中最有注意價值的一個提議，主張工部局發行貨幣，應訂住了英鎊或美元，以小數量的流通，獲最完備的管理，像香港、新加坡，便是一個好榜樣。雖明究應訂住於何項水準，尚待集思廣益；但大多數主張，應訂住於比現在匯價較高的水準，以為當規定於八辦士至八辦士半之間。由工部局組織貨幣委員會，由委員會對工部局負責主持紙幣發行事宜。每元紙幣，均須以十足的英金或美英圓為準備。比方說，按八辦士半發行，假定一家銀行向委員會領用五十萬元紙幣，就當繳存英金一七，七〇八鎊六先令八辦士。以後倘市上覺着此項紙幣供過於求，委便當按八辦士即用英金一六，六六六鎊十三先令四辦士，收回這五十萬的紙幣。照引辦法，此項紙幣，都有它自已的準備，而其中大部份的凖備，可以騰出從事投資，只須保留通常的準備額，以資應付便來得。它的結論，認為此舉如能走上軌道，在種種理由上，都能使各方面蒙着利益云云。</p>
<p>這篇文章發表之後，頓時引起旅滬外僑響應。本市英法文報紙，每日均有論列。到了前幾天，字林西報更在顯明地位，詳述各方面人士對於此舉的渴望與歡迎。有的認為以工部局的地位，對此或有未便，不妨由銀行家起而代之，並稱如中國政府等不加反對，本市某大外商銀行準備考慮發行云云。於是這一個提議，駸駸然有見諸實行的趨勢。</p>
<p>因此，我們以上海市民的立場，自然也不便對之沈默，敢把我們的意見，寫在下面。</p>
<p>第一，我们敢說這個建議的動機，僅僅為工部局及外商　維持收支平衡見，似乎不值得這般小題大做。因為同樣地增加納稅人或市民負擔，何發直截痛快，仿照輪船公司用港幣或其他牙幣來計算捐稅及水電費用，來得簡捷。倘真的為全上海市民的幸福打算，則此舉結果，恐怕正與預期相反。要知道現下上海外匯暗市的狂縮與混亂，市面的停滯，社會生活的不安定，完全是為了平準基金停止供給外匯之後，各種謠諑乘隙而入，民衆對法幣發生懷疑所致。那末，要謀市發生活的安定，市面的活潑，市政當局正當竭全力維持法幣信用且不睱，安可投井下石，另外創造一種新貨幣，來攪亂市面呢？自戰事發生至今，已逾二年，中國法幣，始終沒有惡性膨脹的跡象，這是中外一致承認的鐵一般的事實。雖則前天重慶方面發表中中央農四行最近發行總額，共為二十六萬萬元，較戰前約增加十二萬萬元，但它的生金銀及外匯準備，仍佔百分之四十四，還是比其他各國為高。而且這些增發的法幣，大都流通於西南西北諸省，以代昔日的省鈔與惡性膨脹不同。至如上海等處的法幣流通額，更是有限；而匯劃制度的推行，更有助於法幣的緊縮。同時外匯暗市的跌落，若照現在市價計算，則法幣名下的生金銀及外匯進備金價值，當然決不止百分之四十四。凡此種種事實，可知決不能拿歐戰時代的馬克和羅布，來此擬中國的法幣。而法幣的所以形成目下地步，完全為了供求失勻，及因戰事所造成的局勢所致。不單只為了巨大的入超，此外還有各種原因，如「聯準劵」及「華與劵」的相繼發行，以及淪陷區內出口貿易的被統制，海關稅收的被截留，在在使法幣蒙受重大打擊。如果大家能認清了這點，就不會對法幣發生懷疑了！</p>
<p>丟開工部局在地皮章程上，是否享有發行權，以及此舉是否達反英美等邦的對華政策，破壞中國的國法不說，單就工部局發行紙幣的效果上推論，恐怕也僅等於零。縱使此項紙幣，有十成的外匯做準備，但是如果不能使持票人自由兌取外匯，則與「聯銀劵」的表面上站住一先令二辦士，和「華興劵」的六辦士，有何區別？當此市面浮動之際，工部局忽然發行新貨幣，不當暗示市民以法幣前途之不可預測，勢必加速市民的資金逃避，同進新貨算則此舉結果旣不能自由易取外匯，當然不會得市民的信任。結果法幣固然因此多蒙一重打擊，而新貨幣的價值，也不見得比法幣加強，惟有使市面愈趨混亂，經濟更遭摧殘罷了！反之，如果此項新貨幣確定按八辦士五的價格，自由兌取外匯，則在目前謠諑百出的局面下，人民的歡迎外匯，自必更較以外匯為擔保的新貨幣為甚。試觀過去幾個月中平準基金的工作，以一千萬鎊的資金，尚不夠填一般投機者和資金逃避者的慾壑，而以工部局的區區外匯基金，又安能長此保持不變，這話又有誰相信呢？</p>
<p>退一步講，假定此項新貨幣，準備十足，價值穩固，備受本市各界歡迎，那末揆之Greshan的定律，立刻會給各方面吸收窖藏起來，累易不肯使用。如是上海市面上流通的，依然盡是此被目為「價值起伏不定」的法幣，然則工部局豈非多此一舉，白忙了一場？</p>
<p>或以香港發行紙幣，穩定於一先令三辦士，迄今屹立不動，工部局為何不能為言，要知道香港地位與上海不同，第一，她的幣制是在中國幣制安定的時候建立；第二，香港可以劃分為一個經濟單位，與中國隔離，而上海乃中國的一個主要口岸，與內地脈絡扣連，雖在目下，也決無單獨組成一個經濟單位的可能。何況工部局僅僅不過一個市政機關，對於海關，司法，行政，金融，都無權力支配或控制，又安能使其分行的紙幣推行無阻呢！</p>
<p>所以我們的結論，這是不可能的「一個通貨計劃」！</p>

<h3>四十萬元的郵票</h3>
<p>— （新夢）</p>
<p>分幣發行後如何處置</p>
<p>市上已有過剩現象　小販商人聽吃虧勿少</p>
<p>自銅元分幣絕跡上海市塲而後，在無辦法中用郵票代幣。最初一分，二分，五分等各種郵票，在市上流通，還嫌缺少，使一般的商人，感到不便。但不久郵票在市塲上流通的數目，日見加多，經過了短短的兩個月，非但不覺缺少，反而到處是郵票，已見過剩的樣子了。</p>
<p>據郵局方面所發表的談話，說是目前在上海市上流通的郵票，已有四十萬元。我們知道分幣券在趕印之中，不久就要在市上流通，等到分幣一流通，郵票的停用，在所必然，但這四十萬元郵票，將如何處置，倒成了一個極大的問題。</p>
<p>筆者最近曾到附近的幾家商店中去訪問，不拘大小，都說積有好多郵票，少的幾元，多的幾十元。爲了郵票的進多出少，於是多數的商店，就另訂方法，凡是購物在五分以下者，可用郵票，而滿了六分，就非拿角票去買不可，這是補救郵票流入過多的權宜辦法。</p>
<p>同時，有幾家商店，爲了積有許多郵票，沒有出路，而每天還是在進來，於是想出了另一辦法，門口掛塊「本號出售郵票，每元一百零五分」的牌子。一元可便宜五分，雖然可誘致若干會打算的主人，主婦去兌郵票，但效果並不大，還是不能使郵票出淸。因而甚至有人願意再把郵票折價，一元可買一百十分，聽說可買一百二十分的也有。</p>
<p>小菜塲上的小販，賣報的孩子，那一個不是手裏藏有一把零星郵票。這種小販子，小商人，拿郵票去糴米，買柴，批貨是不收的。所以你去買報，買東西，時常會有人苦苦的同你哀求，可吾給角票他們找，不要給郵票他們。</p>
<p>推而至於弄堂小販，手工業者，也沒有一個不是積有一火柴盒的郵票。弄髒了叉不用，撕破了又不値錢，每個都對郵票感到一種苦痛和不便，然而你不收郵票，就會沒有生意，也是莫可奈何。</p>
<p>就上面所說的，郵票在布上的過剩，已是件鐵一般的事實。四十萬元郵票在市塲上，將來分幣劵通行後，將如何處置，郵局是吾通融收回，確是個問題。郵票本來好寄信，然而作寄信用嗎，一時也用不完；而且有些污損，就要拒用。規模大些的商店，擱幾塊錢郵票還不致生大問題，但小商人，小販之類，一天賺錢一天用的，經不得一元或幾角錢的郵票，擱在手裏，也許是會連資本都沒有，生意不能再做了，這問題就嚴重了！</p>
<h3>小敎同人消費合作社</h3>
<p>— 乙</p>
<p>大家來培植這個小生命罷！</p>
<p>我想在流浪先生介紹過銀錢業同人消費合作社之後，來報吿一點本市小學敎育同人消費合作社的大槪。</p>
<p>小敎同人消費合作社在七個月以前已成立了。社員五百餘人，有着相當嚴密的組織。社章裏面規定，每股國幣一元，每社員認股，以二十股爲限。並且，不論股數的多少，每一社員，選舉的時候，都是只有一權的資格。這可以避免大股東的操縱，倒是很合理的。</p>
<p>因爲社員和營業範圍限於小學校，所以該社除設立一個總辦事處外，在若干中心地點的學校，都設一個分站。各站有一個負責收發貨單貨品的站長，各區叉設有總站，收發各分站的貨單貨品。總辦事處，有一個職員和幾個工友，專司購買及分送的職務。這樣，雖然因爲職員人手的缺少，傳遞不能過於敏捷，但是貨品單交出以後，至遲廿四小時，總辦事處的工友，是會騎着自由車把貨品送到你那裏的。</p>
<p>到現在爲止，小敎消費合作社已經接洽妥了五十多個廠家或商號，能够得到特別的優待。像公盛米號，國華煤球公司，中國化學工藝社，家庭工業社，五洲大藥房，中法藥房，中國國貨公司及振豐，五和，國華等汗衫廠，都竭表同情，予以特別的折扣。可是因爲社員數量的不够，資力的不足，各方面當然還未能達到理想的目標。從今以後，一方面將靠着原有社員的努力，一方面更將依賴各界人士的同情援助，來好好的培植這個小生命呢</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　烟火知家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>是從中國的重慶，與阿拉默都之間，直接飛航，載客運郵。後來中國的新疆地方，日漸繁榮，甘肅，成都，陝西等處，飛航日繁，都與蘇聯相接。至於中亞細亞一帶，那都是高山沙原，中國一時無暇及此，只好讓蘇聯去開闢航空綫了。而且那些遠航飛機，在前十年的時候，載重一百噸，載客一百人，用六座發動機，大家已經覺得很爲納罕了。誰知這幾年工夫下來，載重五百噸，載客　百人的飛機，已經視爲尋常的事了。我今目不談世界航空的事，且說何儷玉以爲開辦這個織綢廠必須到美國去一趟。考察國外絲織物的時尙，是最要緊的，購買機器，也得要內行的人去最好。而且她此去乘了汎美公司的太平洋飛機去，在美國考察完了，可以由美國乘了大西洋飛機，到歐洲去。在英國，德國，意國，以及各國暢游一番後，回頭到法國巴黎，乘了中法航空公司的飛機，回到上海來，多則一月，少則兩星期，也可以都舒齊了。不過這件事，常然也要請命於父親的。第三件事，便是關於開辦這個織綢廠的開辦經費了。有了錢，然後可以辦事，造房子，買機器，租地皮，招工人，一切的一切，都要用錢。這筆錢，還是從北方劃下來呢？還是就近向銀行裏去支取？就何先生個人而言，他的金融方面，很爲活動。上海有好幾家銀行，與何先生都有往來，允其幾家私家銀行，如廣東銀行，華僑銀行之類，何先生還兼了董事之職。銀行裏認得何先生的，也都認得他兩位雙胞胎的小姐。而且何先生臨行時，把自己的支票簿簽好了字，交與他兩位小姐，耍用錢時，儘管開了數目，向銀行裏去支取便了。但這兩位小姐，倘然用幾千塊錢的話，可以不先稟明父親，開了支票去取，上了萬的款子，却必先請父親的示。况且這個織綢廠，是股份公司，還有幾位父執的股東，他們的股款，如何交付？或者由那一家銀行劃來？股款赴否一决交足？或先付若干？這都要請命於父親的。在籌備期間，最好是請好一位會計先生。（一六七）</p>

<h3>一張生活預算表</h3>
<p>— TC</p>
<p>上海的物價在天天的高漲，眞使一般小職員們呌苦連天，非但要維持一家幾口的生活，並且還要負擔子女的敎育費，禮金的往來，衣服的添置……，眞是苦得不能應付，所以最近有許多人爲了不能應付生活，壯者就挺而走險，弱者雖然硬着頭皮用了生平所有的力氣掙扎着，來勉强的維持下去，也是山窮水盡，巧婦難爲無米之炊了。</p>
<p>我有一位親戚，一家有四口：夫婦二人和二個孩子。他是在南京路某大公司任職員，月薪五十元；他的夫人是在某小學任小學敎員，月薪十五元，他們總共的收人是每月六十五元。但是在這物價飛漲的上海，要靠它來維持一家四口，並負擔一切雜用，也是一件不容易的事，以致他們時常感到新陳不接之苦。在最近幾月來，他們定了一張生活預算表，每月的支出都依照道張预算表上付出，一點也不敢疏忽，現他們一家的生活非但安定了，並且還能有一點剩餘。可見预算表對於生活拮摒的小職員們是有很大的幫忙，現在我把它抄在下面，介紹給各位感到生活困難的小職員們，希望你們也從今天起定一張預算表，依照它支付，也得到美滿的生活。</p>
<p>收入：</p>
<p>六十五元</p>
<p>支出：</p>
<p>房金（亭子間）十五元</p>
<p>伙食（包飯二客）十七元（編者按：如果是中晚兩餐，决沒有這樣便宜；如果是一餐，還有一餐如何解决？）</p>
<p>另用：約四元。</p>
<p>預備禮金：四元（有餘積藏，以備遇特殊情形之不足。）</p>
<p>中央儲蓄會（四分之一會）三元（若遇中小獎或末字充作添置衣服用具等）</p>
<p>添置衣服（按月積下）七元</p>
<p>敎育費（按月積下）三元</p>
<p>電影（每星期一次，座價在一角半至三角三之間）</p>
<p>車資：約四元。</p>
<p>總計　支出共六十元收入共六十五元</p>
<p>每月尙餘五元，以補特殊情形之不足。</p>
<h3>芳草美人</h3>
<p>白華</p>
<p>“The　Lady's　From　Kentucky”</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>最近看到不少以賽馬爲題材的電影。道類電影的懾製動機，猜測起來，有下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）在廣闊的養馬塲中，馳騁着壯健的馬匹，由於優越的攝影條件，可以攝製很優美的外景。如能攝製五彩片，如「香姝寳馬」，自然更見美麗。</p>
<p>（二）以男女間的戀愛爲最後賽馬的勝負關鍵，在緊張的氛圍中給觀衆以刺激。</p>
<p>但是這部「芳草美人」的編製技巧實在太平庸了。旣沒有明顯的主題，也沒有曲折離奇的故事，即是貫穿這故事的羅曼斯，也勉强得很。</p>
<p>導演手腕，也見貧弱。介紹馬緹白拉克出塲，費去那末多的膠片，是不値得的。全片的進展，平淡而沉悶。如白拉克暗中命他的朋友毛斯携「雷門遜」（馬名）去參加比賽，「雷門遜」雖然奪得冠軍，但以年輕，疲憊之至，潘妮因之憎恨白拉克。這是本片最主要的關鍵，如寫文章的承上轉下，但是導演者，也是輕輕地放過了。許甫赫勃脫和柴蘇薛茨這兩滑稽角色的穿挿，也是生硬得很。總之，導演者祗是盡了介紹故事之職而已。</p>
<p>喬治賴甫德的馬緹白拉克和愛儂屈露都平平，原因是無戲可做。</p>

<h3>從影往事及觀感（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>——談瑛女士的談話</p>
<p>編者介紹：談瑛從影年久，早具深長歷史，其作派以浪漫見長，因有東方嘉竇之譽；近年潛心藝事，益多優良成就。今就歷述從影往事觀之，足見每一成名藝人，各有因由，而所宣「藝術是永生的」之電影觀感，亦復甚見切實，極可讚佩。</p>
<p>我也是一位標凖影述，八年前的事想起來是多可笑呢。</p>
<p>在求學時期校中每天功課完畢之後，一心又想去看電影；這樣，看片子每禮拜至少兩次，我是生就有些神經質的，感覺力似亦異常敏銳。每片看完以後，自己老是默默地想着與照樣做起麗琳甘許，嘉寳等人的種種表情，有時也是那麼來一下仰天悲鳴，眞的就會簌簌地淚下如粳。第二天上學去後，每决更得在許多同學面前，速說帶做，有哭有笑地盡情演述昨天看過的片子。同學們大家看得津津有味，常說：「阿談的表情眞不錯啊，將來準會做電影明星」。到後來誰知道眞會吃起電影飯來，自己實在覺得可笑極了！</p>
<p>最先，在十七歲那年，偶然跑到但杜宇先生的上海影戲公司裏去，參觀阮玲玉女士拍演的「玉堂春」影片；但先生看到我穿上一套靑布童裝，跳跳繃繃的樣子，便說：「Wonderful　這大孩子多好玩啊」！於是問我：「你喜觀拍電影嗎」？我說：「我最喜歡的事便是拍電影」。第二天的定去拍照試演各種姿勢和表情；結果，但先生認爲非常滿意；不久便復就派我主演了一部「失足恨」。雖則我是初獻身手，而一無師自通」的各種表情却似熟極而流，一些不覺得繁難。據他們誇讚都說我極富演劇天才。實在那不過是污積。儲了很久的一腔熱情，趁這機會大膽妄爲的一洩爲快而已，說起來眞是那麼很滑稽的。</p>

<h3>孫毓堃努力振作</h3>
<p>— 燕雁</p>
<p>的確，孫毓坤的墮落，在武生界中是一大損失。他有極好的根柢，倘使能够努力於藝術，前途是不可限量的。可惜的是不知自愛，漸趨沒落，怎不令人爲他可惜。他是兪振庭的外甥，老伶工孫棣香的兒子，名敎師范福泰的門生，梨園世家，幼年宗法舅父俞振庭，故而取名爲小振庭。以後力學楊小樓，爲後起中學小樓最得神似者，有人會以「繼小樓藝術者孫毓堃」一語贊賞他，照理他應該如何的力求上進，可是他的懶病比誰都深，於是漸漸的爲人厭惡了。一直到現在，因爲經過了許多困難，他才覺悟以前的錯誤，於是解除一切不良嗜好，每日努力用工，我下把到私寓練武，預備努力振作一下，到秋天以後，自己挑大樑組班出台。我希望他能够自我覺悟，回頭是岸，要回復到當年的盛譽，尙還不遲；吾則他的一生果然完了，而平劇界同時也失去了一個有用的人材，豈不可惜？</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>今昔邀角之不同</p>
<p>還有一層，從前的規矩，凡因私行勾角而被人痛毆以致身帶重傷的，就是鬧到官府，打了官司，也是佔個下風，並且弄得不好。還許要判上個什麼罪名，被常地官府打遞解還鄉呢。按理說：人家滿好的營業，正唱得好好的戲，忽然被你偷偷的把台柱子勾走，馬上就得關門大吉，彼時交通不便，現邀新角常然來不及，但是後台幾十口人每日的飯食開銷都得照常供給，這樣園主豈不賠累甚鉅；所以鬧到官府，至少要判勾角者一個刁惡不法破壞他人營業的罪名。再者說本地面的縣太爺莫不偏向自己所轄境內的子民，旣然抓住他道個錯，那還有不重辦的麼？所以我上面曾說過，凡來勾的人要不是一位硬漢，那簡直是絲毫無濟於事的。</p>
<p>照上面所說勾角旣是如此艱難，那怎麼還會常常發生好角私奔的事呢，原來各行人有各行人的神通手段，縱令園主防範的再嚴。只要他們安心要來勾人，那就終有達到目的的一天，所謂防不勝防也。當勾角人初來的時候，照樣也扮作商人模樣，倘若自己認爲能力稍差，有時也携帶一兩個帮手，旣達目的地後，如有當地熟人家裏可以借住，則比較更爲妥善，吾則只好投宿在客店裏，上半天無事，也將隨身帶來不甚値錢的土產，向街上尋些買主，藉此遮掩店中人耳目，等到午後或晚問沒事時，即到戲園中走走。</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Insists on Two Demands, Tokyo Negotiations Stalled, Japan Sends Major General Mutō to Visit Britain as an Unofficial Envoy, London News: Japanese Army Discouraged by the Trend of Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Anglo-Japanese talks, the Japanese side has not yet received any notification from the British side, so the stalemate had to continue on the 3rd. At 9:45 a.m., Major General Mutō and Major Miyamoto held a two-hour meeting with Minister Katō at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After discussing comprehensive countermeasures on the Japanese side, they visited Major General Beckett at the Kai Kōsha and stated that if the United Kingdom sincerely expressed concrete application methods for general principles, Japan could also seriously consider the United Kingdom's position, and urged that understanding of this proposal be promoted. (3rd Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations regarding the Tianjin Incident have stalled. The police subcommittee meeting could not be held, and the economic subcommittee also made no progress yesterday. British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Katō, the leader of the Japanese delegation at the Round Table Conference, held a private meeting yesterday in Tokyo for a little over an hour. According to Japanese sources, the meeting aimed to prepare the ground for the next plenary session. The plenary session has not been held since July 28. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The economic issues that have become problematic in the Anglo-Japanese local negotiations have not been able to continue to this day because the British side has not yet received instructions from its own country. In the afternoon of the 2nd, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited Minister Katō at the Tokyo Club, where Minister Katō pointed out that Japan's demands regarding economic issues were extremely appropriate, that the British side should seriously consider them, and that he hoped the United Kingdom would conduct negotiations with a truly sincere attitude. (3rd Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, when British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Katō, the chief Japanese representative, last night, he proposed that economic issues should not be included on the agenda. He also proposed that the Round Table Conference should handle issues of peace and order on the basis of stopping the Tianjin blockade after both sides reached a compromise. It is reported that Katō rejected both of the above proposals. The newspaper also stated that after Katō consulted with Foreign Minister Arita, he immediately met with the British Ambassador at the Tokyo General Meeting last night. Katō immediately reiterated that the Japanese government could not accept these proposals, and expressed the Japanese view that this conference would not be completed smoothly unless the British delegation fully accepted the Japanese demands. Neither the subcommittee nor the Round Table Conference met today, but the British ambassador may meet with Katō again. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A semi-official Japanese news agency today published an authoritative statement expressing Japan's attitude toward the anti-British movement in North China and Japan, as well as the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. It said that although Tokyo newspapers carry pessimistic news, believing that the Anglo-Japanese conference has reached a stalemate, the current situation is not so hopeless. The Japanese representative insists on the current procedures adopted for the Anglo-Japanese conference, arguing that economic and police issues cannot be analyzed separately and that agreement cannot be sought solely on the police aspect. Any attempt to separate these two issues contradicts the Arita-Craigie Agreement. As for the anti-British movement in Japan, it is an automatic expression of national sentiment. The popular movement in North China is caused by Britain's pro-Chiang policy. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the State Department had sent special instructions to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Dooman, instructing him to protest to the Japanese government about the dangers of the anti-foreign movement in the Japanese occupied areas. Welles explained that Dooman had made the protest to Japan on Tuesday in a private conversation, pointing out that the current anti-British movement in the Japanese occupied areas had become a widespread anti-foreign movement. The U.S. government is extremely concerned about this and holds Japan responsible for the current anti-foreign movement. Regarding unofficial reports in the Japanese press that the Japanese government intends to recall the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Welles said that he did not see that the Japanese government would do so. Regarding the compilation of statistics by U.S. consuls in China on disputes between the United States and Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Welles said that U.S. consuls in China may have compiled these statistics based on standing instructions. Although he does not know the exact number of incidents, according to reports received, there have been more than 600 such disputes. Regarding the anti-British movement expanding into an anti-American movement, Welles said that the State Department is closely monitoring infringements on the interests of the American people. The U.S. government habitually pays attention only to the interests of its own people and intends to continue to adopt an independent policy. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A British government spokesman told reporters yesterday that the anti-British movement promoted by Japan in the occupied areas has undermined the Arita-Craigie Agreement. As for whether the Japanese side deliberately undermined this Anglo-Japanese plan or was unable to fulfill the conditions of understanding, it is still difficult to know for the time being. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials may be willing to fulfill their obligations under the agreement, but it is also possible that the Japanese military authorities in China will still pursue their independent policy and intensify anti-British activities. The authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are still exchanging views on the Far East issue. Britain's attitude towards the Tianjin silver issue is becoming more rigid, and it firmly rejects Japan's demands for legal tender. It is said that the British cabinet considered whether Britain should abolish the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation if the current Tokyo negotiations fail. Britain is now planning to extend the period of the Tokyo negotiations as much as possible. It is also heard that the British cabinet was quite encouraged by Canada's support for abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, but Australia and India are not enthusiastic about abolishing it due to the large amount of cotton and woolen textiles they export to Japan. At the same time, the British government received reliable information that Japanese military leaders were greatly discouraged by the instability of the situation in China and the possibility of a joint Anglo-American ban on the export of arms to Japan. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Snell, leader of the opposition in the House of Lords, today, at the beginning of the foreign policy debate, asked Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax to explain the Tokyo plan and to guarantee that the government would not change its policy toward China and would continue to support Chinese legal tender. Lord Snell declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain seemed to be irritated and impatient with members who were seeking information. Members of Parliament were working somewhat in the dark, and had to read the newspapers to know everything, except for the meager news they received from the government, which was close to being obnoxious.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Natural Thrift</h3>
<p>To still lavishly discuss enjoyment today is, in terms of insight, truly on par with "Why not eat meat porridge?". If we consider the July price increases alone, the number of businesses that have published notices of price increases has already reached 152, and the number that have followed the general market trend without public announcement is unknown. The number of advertisements for price increases on August 1 alone exceeded ten, and the upward trend is still in full swing. As a result, Shanghai residents fear that food will not be available, and are burdened by the "seven necessities of life". With the exception of a very small number of wealthy people who are well-off and those who have become rich through speculation, most feel pain and are deeply concerned that the future is long, prices will rise endlessly, and they will not be able to bear the burden of supporting their elders and raising their young. However, observing their living conditions, they are still accustomed to extravagance and compete in luxury, disregarding the value of thrift and simplicity, and only worrying about high prices and the difficulty of making a living. This is quite contradictory!</p>
<p>The national crisis has reached this point, it is extremely serious. Life has reached this point, it is extremely difficult. Encountering national crisis and hardship in life is certainly reasonable and what we should expect, because national affairs are much more important than life. Moreover, the so-called difficulties today do not yet mean going hungry and not having clothes to cover the body. During the European War, Germany's supplies were cut off, and bread was distributed based on head count, calculated to the last gram. Those with large appetites had barely enough to eat. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of cotton, all cotton bedding and clothing were requisitioned by the government to make ammunition, and paper products were used as substitutes. Other daily necessities were impossible to purchase, yet the people remained calm. This was due to the war, but in peacetime, during the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan, food was also distributed based on head count. Apart from what was necessary for life, all other items for enjoyment were used for export to obtain cash. The people suffered hardships but ultimately built up the country. If Shanghai residents think of this, they will find comfort in their current difficulties. Moreover, war is a calamitous event, as the ancients clearly taught. Therefore, a country does not lightly resort to arms unless absolutely necessary. China's resistance war was forced upon it. Victory would wipe out years of national humiliation and establish the foundation for rejuvenation, and the future happiness of the people would be boundless. Defeat would plunge future generations into an irrecoverable abyss, let alone personal property. Now that final victory is assured, what is there to worry about with temporary difficulties?</p>
<p>Even in terms of common sense, hardship can build a nation, while ease and comfort can destroy it. Wealth is not to be relied upon. Kou Zhun's achievements were brilliant and surpassed his contemporaries, but his descendants were impoverished because he lived lavishly. This serves as a warning. Therefore, the world's cycles of wealth and poverty, with the rich becoming poor and the poor becoming rich, are like nature evening out wealth and poverty, and adjusting fullness and emptiness. Yet, people do not understand that this is the inevitable consequence of arrogance and extravagance versus diligence and thrift. Now prices have risen again and again. Most people in Shanghai will be forced to move towards thrift. This forced thrift can also be said to be the result of natural thrift, not because they have realized the impropriety of arrogance, extravagance, and licentiousness. Those who are rich continue to spend as usual, so their consumption is even greater. Those in the middle class do not change their lifestyle, so their financial difficulties are even deeper. In order to continue their lives, they have no choice but to do so. Because of this, their thrift is difficult to sustain, and old habits return once the situation passes. We do not expect everyone to practice thrift strictly. It is commendable to keep to one's place and not go too far. In today's world, those who aspire to the Way and are not ashamed of wearing coarse clothes and eating simple meals will be seen as pedantic. Therefore, there are those who are unwilling to humble themselves for the sake of life and claim to be wise men of the times. From this, we can see the evils of luxury. Becoming accustomed to wrong and turning it into right, accumulating dirt and filth, destroying reason, obscuring it with private desires, not caring about ourselves, let alone our descendants, how can we still love our family and country?</p>
<p>However, Confucius said, "Wealth and rank are what men desire, but if they cannot be obtained in the right way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike, but if they cannot be avoided in the right way, they should not be abandoned." It can be seen that the ancients still had a sense of proportion in their choices between poverty, wealth, rank, and lowliness. This natural measure of proportion lies within the mind! We are unfortunate to live in this time of great tribulation, but we are also fortunate to have tasted suffering and experienced the world, so that our will is strengthened and our actions are more outstanding. This is an opportunity given to us by Heaven to temper ourselves. How can we forget our responsibilities, indulge in pleasure, and wallow in wine and women, thinking that life is for enjoyment? The individual's enjoyment should indeed be like this. Recently, Shanghai's foreign exchange has plummeted and prices have soared. Tracing the cause, it may not be unrelated to the extravagance of Shanghai people. What is the blame of legal tender? If Shanghai people can understand the difficulties of the country, abandon extravagance, and practice thrift, then today's life may not necessarily be so difficult.</p>
<p>Heaven helps those who help themselves. Those who hope to get help from others should also do their best to help themselves. Otherwise, people will see us as a nation of laziness, indolence, and pleasure-seeking, without perseverance and determination. How can we survive in the world? Therefore, simplicity can clarify one's ambition, and tranquility can lead to distance. If we can practice thrift and restore the inherent virtue of thrift of the Chinese nation, I cannot help but look forward to it!</p>
<h3>The Issue of Legal Tender Stability: Britain Proposes Revised Measures, All Banks Are Willing to Replenish Funds, But Only to the Extent of Balancing Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>(London) British banks previously involved in the organization of the £10 million Chinese currency equalization fund have not yet been contacted by the government regarding the continued supply of funds, but it is heard that the banks are very willing to do so, provided that the Treasury continues to provide guarantees. The current status of the original equalization fund is extremely difficult to estimate, but it is said that a great deal has already been used. According to London sources, if the equalization fund is replenished, its methods must be modified somewhat. It is heard that some have used the equalization fund as a means of facilitating the escape of Chinese funds, and this must be stopped. Hereafter, the fund should only be used to maintain an appropriate average of imports and exports. This matter may be in progress, and any negotiations regarding replenishing the equalization fund are not within the scope of the banks. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The newspapers here are still paying close attention to the situation in the Far East. The intensity of the anti-British movement in the Japanese-occupied areas of China and the currency issue that has caused the Tokyo conference to stall are all regarded as extremely important by the newspapers. The House of Commons China Affairs Committee met last night and is said to have discussed the Chinese currency issue and the situation in North China in detail. It is heard that members of the House of Commons recently met with Prime Minister Chamberlain in a private capacity to state the absolute necessity of dealing with Japanese demands with a firm attitude. The Daily Telegraph today carried an article entitled "Japan's Strategy of Inducing Chinese Legal Tender to Commit Suicide," saying that Japan has failed to kill Chinese legal tender by its own methods and now has no choice but to hire others to do it. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News recently commented on the issue of Chinese legal tender, saying that Prime Minister Chamberlain's assurance that Britain's policy toward China will not change is encouraging, but it is still appropriate for the government to continue to take concrete actions to maintain Chinese legal tender. The stability of legal tender is not only appropriate for justice, but also related to British prestige, and is extremely important to our country's economic interests, which is undeniable. If we allow Japan to plunge China's currency system into collapse and forcibly establish a monetary fortress in China, attracting the country to join the Japanese yen group, then our country's trade with China will inevitably suffer a setback. Therefore, our country has sufficient reasons to maintain Chinese legal tender, but the price should not be too high. Judging from the current situation, the price may not be very high. What needs to be decided is what is the most advantageous way to protect it. This issue is quite complex. For the government, it only needs to grant China a huge amount of credit to alleviate the pressure on Chinese legal tender. In addition, Japan's demand for the transfer of silver deposits in Tianjin should be firmly rejected, and Japan should not be assisted in driving legal tender out of North China, because helping Japan establish a puppet currency system is tantamount to suicide.

<h3>Inside Japan, People's Livelihoods Are Hard, and Income Tax Must Be Increased</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to increase income tax by 500 million yen annually, the Japanese government has submitted a new income tax plan to the Tax Reform Administration Council, proposing to levy income tax according to the following four categories: (1) real estate and dividends, (2) commerce and profession, (3) earned income, salary and pension, (4) group income. Fixed deductions will be given according to the number of family members, but only those with income below 500 yen will be exempt from income tax. The standard rate of the new tax is 10% for the first category, 8.5% for the second category, 6% for the third category, and 8% for the fourth category. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today continued to attack the U.S. government for abolishing the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun claimed that "not only must the cunning British be taught a lesson, but also countries that cause damage and are reckless must be taught the same lesson." The Miyako Shimbun said that "the U.S. must bear the responsibility for the current U.S.-Japan relations. The U.S. abolition of the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has terminated the friendly relations between the U.S. and Japan. President Roosevelt has completely destroyed 28 years of U.S.-Japan friendship. If the U.S. insists on refusing to recognize the new order in Asia, we should regard the U.S. as our enemy." Japanese newspapers insisted that Japan could resist the U.S. ban on exporting war materials to Japan, and hinted that Japan was unwilling to test Japan's capabilities in this regard. At the same time, Japanese newspapers continued their fierce anti-British movement, blaming the unrest in China over the past two years mostly on Britain, saying that last year's attempt to assassinate senior officials of the "Provisional Government" in Peiping also originated in the British Concession in Tianjin.

<h3>U.S. and Britain Protest to Japan Simultaneously, British Newspapers Say It Is Another Warning, Members of Parliament Question Again in the House of Commons, Navigation Issue in the Hongkou Concession</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail today published an editorial entitled "Another Warning," which stated that the U.S. and Britain now have a closer alliance to counter Japan's arrogant strategy in China. If it is hoped that the Tokyo Conference will continue to be effective, they must stop this strategy. Harsh words may impress Japanese politicians, but if Japanese military leaders in China are to understand, there may need to be further indications. It should be known that we and the U.S. both hold powerful economic weapons. In the first three months of 1939, Britain purchased nearly £2.5 million worth of Japanese goods, while selling only £300,000 worth to Japan. We have a great possibility of reversing this difference and putting Japan at a great disadvantage. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie protested to the Japanese government yesterday regarding the anti-British demonstrations in North China, and U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Japan Dooman also made representations regarding the anti-American incidents that have occurred recently in the Japanese occupied areas of China. This matter was recently commented on by the Daily Express, saying, "It is gratifying to see that the British government is following in the footsteps of the U.S. government by protesting to the Japanese government at the same time. Since our country has the same interests as the U.S. in the Far East, and our views are also the same, we should follow the same path as that country and use its methods and goals as a model." (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative Member of Parliament Morley asked in the House of Commons today about the outcome of discussions between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the local Japanese authorities regarding the recovery of the administrative rights over the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas. Prime Minister Hastings has prepared to contact the Japanese government on this matter. Undersecretary Butler replied that the discussions between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the authorities are still in progress and are said to have reached a compromise on certain measures. It seems that there is no need for the British government to take any action at this time. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Conservative Member of Parliament Major General Knox raised a question, saying that the government had instructed Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie on June 6 to make representations regarding Japan's restrictions on British commerce along the Yangtze River in China. It is not known whether any answer has been received. Foreign Office official Butler replied immediately. Knox then said, "Eight weeks have passed since the representations were made. Even if the Japanese government is habitually slow to respond, an answer should have been given within this period." Undersecretary Butler then replied again, "Eight weeks is ample time, and the nature of the issue is quite urgent. This is why the government has ordered Ambassador Craigie to continue to urge the Japanese government to give a reply immediately." At this point, Liberal Member of Parliament Mander also asked, "How much time did it take for the U.S. to protest to Japan and receive an answer?" Undersecretary Butler did not answer. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative Member of Parliament Graham asked Colonial Secretary MacDonald in the House of Commons today whether the Japanese authorities' cutting off food supplies from various small ports on the mainland to Hong Kong had come to his attention. MacDonald replied that the Hong Kong government is closely monitoring the local food situation, and so far there is no need to take special steps to obtain supplies. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Suffers Repeated Setbacks, Considers New Alliance with Germany and Italy, Army Authorities Met Yesterday to Discuss European Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of the Army and the General Staff held a joint meeting to discuss the intensification of anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, the conflict on the Manchurian border, and the current situation of the Anglo-Japanese Round Table Conference. The Ministry of the Army's organ newspaper, Chishin Shimbun, claimed that the above events are all inseparably linked to Japan's European policy. It is now hoped that the Japanese government will quickly implement the previously established foundation. It is heard that yesterday afternoon's meeting decided that the Ministry of the Army should advocate further resolutions regarding Japan's European policy. This afternoon, the three giants of the Army, namely Chief of General Staff Prince Kan'in, Minister of the Army Itagaki, and Inspector General of Military Education Nishio, held a meeting. Chief of Staff Nakajima and Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau Machijiri also attended. The purpose of this meeting was to decide on the Army's attitude towards the new situation in Europe. If necessary, the Supreme Military Council will be convened. It is heard that today's afternoon meeting intends to allow the Army to state the wishes of the Army when the five cabinet members meet tomorrow to discuss Japan's European policy. Judging from the news that Ambassador to Italy Shiratori and Ambassador to Germany Oshima are currently meeting in Italy regarding this matter, the issue of Japan concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy seems to be urged forward again. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's meeting of the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, the Ambassador to Germany, and their military attachés is considered to be of great significance by political circles. According to Italian sources familiar with the matter, the issue discussed by the two ambassadors is whether Japan should join the German-Italian military alliance, or how to use the results of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations to ask Italy and Germany to mediate the Sino-Japanese War.

<h3>Japanese Authorities in Tanggu Declare Protection of Foreign Lives and Property</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Several examples have been found of direct intimidation of Chinese employees of British people in this city after a group believed to be an anti-British corps organised by the Japanese issued letters to said Chinese employees. Most of the Chinese people remain harmonious as usual, or are not concerned, this dispute is started by a small group of people who have the full support of Japanese newspapers, and most Chinese believe that the instigators are supported by the Japanese military authorities, so it is easy to form a serious situation, the British authorities are negotiating with the Japanese embassy because of the new anti-British demonstration actions, and urging the Japanese authorities not to forget their responsibility to maintain law and order in the joint control area, today Tianjin News said that the Japanese military commander in Tanggu announced that although the army will not interfere with the march and demonstration movement, it will protect the lives and property of foreigners, and the anti-British movement in the area has been slightly quelled. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to news here today, the Japanese-controlled Chinese newspapers have unanimously intensified their anti-British activities, and British residents in Shanxi are also being forced to leave the country. However, due to the disruption of railway traffic, some British missionaries are now gathering in Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan, waiting for trains to Peiping. At the same time, many Chinese servants employed in British homes here have also left. (3rd Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Important Figure in Canada Advocates Severing Economic Ties with Japan; U.S. Senator Requests Hull to Advise Munitions Merchants Not to Support Japan</h3>
<p>Ottawa, Canada - The leader of the New Democratic Party, and former envoy to the U.S., Mr. He Li-zhi, recently issued a declaration, urging the government to immediately sever economic ties with Japan, stating roughly: "No democratic nation has any reason to maintain friendly relations with fascist Japan in any way. The United States has already acknowledged this by abolishing the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. For Canada's sake, and for the sake of our duty to the British Empire and neighboring United States, we should also sever economic ties with Japan. Since Canada and the United States share a common border, we should adopt a common policy towards Japan with the United States." (2nd Reuters dispatch from Ottawa)</p>
<p>(Washington) - Senator Schwellenbach, a Democrat from Washington State, recently stated in a speech to the Senate, "I have requested Secretary of State Hull to advise our nation's munitions exporters to no longer support Japan. Japan's needs for copper, steel, iron, and machinery are almost entirely supplied by the United States. Secretary of State Hull made a similar request to aircraft manufacturers last June, which proved effective. If this request is adopted, the shipment of U.S. munitions to Japan could be reduced by half or even two-thirds. When the Sino-Japanese war first began, I introduced a bill advocating for the prohibition of scrap iron shipments to Japan. Unexpectedly, parties involved in the scrap iron export industry protested vehemently. Now, these same parties no longer oppose the same bill." (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Celebrated Author H.G. Wells Predicts Japanese Crisis Similar to Russia in 1918; Defeated Troops Returning Home Will Disadvantage Aristocrats and Wealthy Gentry</h3>
<p>(London) - The celebrated author H.G. Wells published an article in the Daily Herald, predicting the future of the Far East, stating that Japan currently possesses the same factors as Russia in 1918, namely the factor of brutal rebellion. Nothing poses a greater threat to the government than the return of defeated troops. Aristocrats, wealthy gentry, and monks will all be disadvantaged. Japan will reshape its social and economic life, though its starting point may be lower than Russia's. The main forces in China today are communism and the New Life Movement. These two can resist external humiliation, but may not truly merge. Once China is liberated, it will become a battleground for the world's idealists. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Kunming Begins Controlling Prices</h3>
<p>Kunming - Kunming began implementing a price control system this week in an effort to curb illegal profiteering. The provincial government has ordered shopkeepers to prepare price lists for inspection by police officers, who must be satisfied that the prices are reasonable. The provincial government's implementation of this measure has already led to a slight drop in the value of major commodities in recent days. For example, the current price of rice is 30 yuan per stone, compared to 33 yuan a few days ago. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) - According to Chinese military experts today, the Japanese army's five-pronged attack on the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi last month is destined to fail. At present, the strength of the attacking Japanese troops has been almost completely exhausted. Although the outer strongholds of Nationalist Chinese forces in the Taihang Mountains were temporarily abandoned under the fierce attack of the Japanese army, once the Japanese army penetrated slightly deeper, the Nationalist Chinese forces immediately used extremely swift actions to attack their weak flanks. In the recent counter-offensive by the Nationalist Chinese forces in the area, ten important locations that had been lost previously have been recaptured, such as Yushe, Heshun, Yangcheng, Dongfeng, and Qinshui. At the same time, the Japanese troops in the Taihang Mountains area have become isolated units, lacking contact with each other. They have been feeling great difficulty in terms of military replenishment and the supply of food and military fire, because their communication lines to the north and west have now been cut off by the Nationalist Chinese forces. At the same time, the sudden rise of Qinshui and the floods in other parts of North China have also greatly hindered the Japanese military operations and reinforcement supplements.

<h3>Rumors of Japanese Intention to Open the Pearl River</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - Rear Admiral Kanazawa, Director of the Information Bureau of the Japanese Navy, stated today that the Japanese government is planning to abandon the blockade of the Pearl River and allow foreign vessels to navigate the Pearl River again. According to Kanazawa, the Japanese army's declaration of the blockade of the Pearl River was originally for military operations. This operation has now been implemented according to plan, so it is possible to open it. There are two conditions that must be attached. First, foreign vessels can only transport necessities for foreigners for the use of foreigners living in Guangdong. Second, if there are new military operations, the military will be able to redeclare the blockade at any time. (3rd Haidong News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Attacked Again at Night; Nationalist Chinese Planes Take to the Air to Respond</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) - Multiple Japanese planes invaded in several batches. Bombs mostly fell in desolate suburbs with little damage. Two batches of Japanese planes, totaling eighteen, attacked Chongqing again on the night of the 2nd. The first batch of nine planes infiltrated the city's airspace, but under close surveillance by Nationalist Chinese air defense forces, the Japanese planes were unable to aim accurately and blindly dropped bombs from high altitude before escaping eastward. The second batch of nine planes infiltrated the eastern suburbs of the city and escaped after dropping bombs. According to post-incident investigations, the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes in various places mostly fell in the desolate suburbs, and there was little loss on the Chinese side.

<p>(Chongqing) - Japanese bombers bombed Chongqing again last night. Because the moonlight was clear, the Japanese planes, in batches of nine, concentrated on bombing the western suburbs, but according to the investigation, the damage was extremely minor. (3rd Haidong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) - When twenty-seven Japanese planes came to bomb last night, they were unable to wreak havoc due to the proper use of searchlights and the fierce firepower of the anti-aircraft guns. When the Japanese planes came, although they were divided into three teams, with nine planes in each team, they were unable to drop bombs in any of the teams and escaped immediately. Only the Chengdu Highway was slightly damaged. In addition to the fierce bombardment of the anti-aircraft guns, six Nationalist Chinese planes took to the air to intercept the Japanese planes. The moon was bright and clear when the Japanese planes attacked, and the targets of the anti-aircraft guns were extremely clear, so they could exert great power. The Japanese planes could only fly in the air. The first batch of nine Japanese planes appeared at 11:10 p.m., but they did not reach the air above the city and hurriedly dropped several bombs in the northern suburbs before escaping. The second team of nine planes appeared at 11:25 p.m. After dropping several bombs in the western suburbs, they circled the city and flew north. At that time, they were chased by Chinese fighter planes. The third team of nine planes appeared at 11:50 p.m. and dropped more than 30 bombs in the Jialing River and Yangtze River areas in the northern suburbs, but did not hit any important targets, so the Chinese side suffered almost no losses in the three air raids. Also, the Japanese air raid was first infiltrated by reconnaissance planes, the purpose of which was to attract Chinese fighter planes away, so that their bombing would not be hindered by Chinese fighter planes, and they could calmly engage in bombing. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) - During the Japanese air raid on Chongqing last night, more than 100 villagers on the mountainside north of the Yangtze River and in the western suburbs were killed or injured. The Japanese planes came in two waves. The first wave totaled 18 or more planes and appeared over Chongqing at 11:30 p.m. The anti-aircraft artillery did not open fire to allow Nationalist Chinese planes to intercept freely. An hour later, a second batch of nine Japanese planes attacked, but did not fly over Chongqing, heavily bombing the commercial airfield 25 miles downstream of Chongqing on the south bank of the Yangtze River before flying back downstream. The sound of the explosions was faintly audible here. The airfield is currently used by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Eurasia Aviation Corporation. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) - A team of Japanese bombers, estimated by Chinese officials to number 18 or more, attacked last night, appearing in the sky at 11:30 p.m. and dropping bombs on the western suburbs. According to Chinese reports, there was no damage or fire. It was reported that Japanese planes dropped bombs along the Chongqing-Chengdu Highway, but most of them fell to the side. A part of the Japanese planes bombed a point 25 miles downstream of Chongqing. The sound of the explosions was slightly audible here. Nationalist Chinese fighter planes repeatedly attacked Japanese planes. Anti-aircraft guns did not open fire to allow Nationalist Chinese fighter planes to intercept freely. The all-clear was sounded at 12:30 a.m. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) - According to reports from Chongqing, Japanese air force bombed Chongqing again on the night of the 2nd. In total, this air raid was the eleventh.

<h3>Residents of Tianjin Concessions Suffer Greatly</h3>
<p>Tightened Blockade Makes Finding Food Difficult; Continuous Heavy Rain Causes Flood Worries</p>
<p>(Tianjin) - Restrictions on passage in the Tianjin concessions have been tightened since yesterday afternoon, especially regarding various foods. Milk shops have been notified that the amount of milk they can bring into the concession each day must not exceed 100 bottles. Since the blockade of the concessions, some foreigners have braved the long journey to purchase goods in the Special District 1 due to the lower prices there, but now each person is only allowed to bring a very small amount of food back into the concession. The restrictions are so strict that they are often insufficient for the daily needs of a family of several people, and all packages must be thoroughly inspected, which takes a long time. The stalls in the British concession's vegetable market are suddenly empty, and the few remaining vegetables are rotten. The stallholders are all pessimistic about the future. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) - Tianjin residents have already suffered greatly due to the hot weather and the blockade of the concessions, and now there is the threat of flooding. This is because there have been continuous heavy rains in the suburbs of Tianjin, and there are several breaches in the Yongding River, causing the flow of the Hai River to become a torrent. Currently, the water level of the Hai River downstream of the British concession is three feet from the shore, and the situation in the Special District 3 is similar. It is hoped that the heavy rains will stop so that Tianjin can avoid another flood. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) - The supply of vegetables to the British and French concessions here is almost zero today. One reason is the restrictions on import by the Japanese, and the other is that the rising waters of the Hai River have flooded many farmlands. Therefore, very few vegetables can be transported to Tianjin. Also, several White Russians carrying a large amount of food attempted to bring it into the British concession today, but were blocked by the Japanese and were unable to enter the concession.

Twelve planes reconnoitered in the area of Yingde and Wengyuan, and six planes broke into Shaoguan, dropping over a hundred bombs in a certain village in the suburbs. Because a Japanese plane had circled and reconnoitered over the village on the 2nd, the villagers had all moved away the previous morning, so only a dozen houses were burned down. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Again Claim Chinese Soldiers Borrow Foreign Flags</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - A Navy spokesman declared today that Japanese pilots have now discovered another case of Chinese soldiers misusing foreign flags. On July 30, Japanese aircraft saw many Chinese trucks carrying military fire traveling between Nanning and Binyang. The Japanese aircraft did not attack because they saw British flags on the trucks. According to the pilot's report, the Chinese soldiers apparently used British flags to avoid Japanese aircraft attacks. If this is the case, the Japanese Navy aircraft will not be responsible for any unfortunate incidents that may occur in the future. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Large Increase in Japanese Troops in Inner Mongolia; Military Vehicles on PingSui Line Continuously Heading West; Also Moving Towards Dolonnur</h3>
<p>(Beiping) - According to the Associated Press, reliable sources have learned that the Japanese army in Inner Mongolia is now greatly increasing. Before the PingSui line was blocked by floods, military vehicles carrying troops and weapons would head west every day. The garrison in Baotou has also seen a large increase. At the same time, the Japanese army on this line and the Inner Mongolian army driven by the Japanese army also appear to be moving towards Dolonnur, which is located in the border area between Inner and Outer Mongolia. This action by the Japanese is a preventive measure to prevent the escalation of conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border. At the same time, the Japanese are also building a railway north of Dolonnur. However, it is not known for sure whether the Japanese troops transferred there are fresh troops dispatched by Japan or exhausted troops transferred from China. Also, according to a Japanese army spokesman, near Baoding, the Japanese army attacked 100 Chinese guerrillas, forcing them to retreat. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>

(3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) - Representatives from the local Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Advisory Committee, Trade Union, Women's Association, and Youth Association have all telegraphed British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The telegram expresses disappointment with the initial UK-Japan agreement, and then requests that the UK end the UK-Japan Tokyo negotiations, because further negotiations will only further damage Britain's international prestige and have no benefit. Moreover, China's current war of resistance is not only for itself, but also for the dignity of international treaties, such as the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. Since the UK is a signatory to these two treaties, it should do its best to assist China. In addition, Japan has never been sincere in negotiations. What will be the result of many negotiations? Therefore, the UK should not be deceived by Japan and should quickly stop the negotiations. The telegram concludes by stating that the Chinese people firmly believe that the UK will maintain its traditional policy of friendship with China, and China will also be grateful for the UK's friendly assistance. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) - The Chongqing United Daily News editorial today expressed confidence that the British government would not change its policy in China, and expressed appreciation for the general British public opinion expressed in newspaper commentaries and House of Commons questions which expressed support for assisting China and adopting a strong Far East policy. It stated that what we hope for is that the British government can find a way to stop Japan's aggression and assist China. As for what action the British government will take, or whether the UK will take the same action with other countries, it is not something we want to interfere with. We only want to see the UK act in accordance with its words. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Optimistic Outlook on British, French, and Soviet Negotiations; Substantial Progress Made on the Definition of "Indirect Aggression"</h3>
<p>Soviet Union Insists on Simultaneous Establishment of Two Agreements</p>
<p>(London) - Regarding the progress of the British, French, and Soviet negotiations, sources close to the government here recently stated that after today's talks between the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and the British and French ambassadors, substantial progress has been made on the definition of "indirect aggression." Regarding this, the British plan, while avoiding interference in the internal affairs of the Baltic states, has made appropriate arrangements to deal with the crisis posed by the formation of National Socialist governments in those countries. This plan is under discussion and the outlook is very optimistic. It is hoped that Prime Minister Chamberlain will report on the progress of the Moscow negotiations before the adjournment of Parliament on the 4th of this month. However, Soviet sources here are very reserved, still insisting that the military agreement and the political agreement should be established simultaneously. If the talks between the British, French, and Soviet staff officers have been delayed for four or five weeks, then the tripartite political agreement may be delayed for several weeks before it can be established.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Meets with Polish Ambassador to Discuss Polish-German Relations; German Suggestion of Eastern European Pact Denied Firmly by British Officials</h3>
<p>(London) - Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Polish Ambassador Raczyński this afternoon to discuss relations between Poland and Germany, as well as the general situation in Europe. Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, it was rumored here yesterday afternoon that Germany had issued a note advocating that Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland hold a meeting to decide to merge the city into Germany, and then conclude an Eastern European Locarno Pact to stabilize the situation in Eastern Europe. People in the Congress heard about it and discussed it. The official side firmly denied it, saying that this was Germany's strategy, intending to test the reactions of Britain and Poland. However, Britain has an obligation to guarantee Poland, and once Poland believes that its vital interests are threatened, it should come out to assist without hesitation. On the Polish side, it was said that the rumor that the Polish government intended to give up the city of Danzig and use the division of Slovakia with Germany as an exchange condition was all unfounded. What Germany covets is named the city of Danzig, but in reality, it is the Polish Corridor and Silesia Province, which is also well known to Poland. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Navy Holds Demonstration in Danzig</h3>

He continued that the president of the German Naval Association, namely the former Chief of Staff of the German High Seas Fleet, has no political significance. Subsequently, Mr. Te delivered a speech, saying, "Anyone who discusses the strength of the German Navy must mention Danzig, because Danzig is the birthplace of the Prussian and German Navies."

<h3>Poland Closely Monitoring the Situation in Danzig</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Polish authorities are currently closely monitoring the movement in Danzig to use economic methods to incorporate the Free City into Germany. It is generally believed that the uproar caused by Poland's withdrawal of customs inspectors from the butter factory and restrictions on fish imports into Danzig are of great significance. Polish sources pointed out that any attempt to open the customs border adjacent to East Prussia, which some parties in Danzig have already threatened, is a unilateral change in the status of the Free City and is unacceptable to Poland. Local newspapers declared that retaliation is unnecessary, as Poland took action because of Danzig's treatment of Polish customs officials. The newspapers also emphasized that repeated protests have been in vain. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Italy Hopes Danzig Problem Will Be Resolved Peacefully</h3>
<p>(Rome) The relevant authorities here expect the European situation to become serious in early September, at which time the Danzig Free City problem will have reached maturity. The German National Socialist Party will inevitably discuss it at the annual conference in Nuremberg. In this way, the European situation will be similar to the tension surrounding the Czech problem in September last year, but it will not lead to war. It is also possible to establish a compromise solution to the Danzig problem, so that Germany's self-esteem is satisfied and the status quo is maintained for a certain period of time. Although this is a temporary measure, it allows Germany and Italy to wait for a better opportunity to satisfy all their wishes and should not be immediately taken as consolation. The Italian side is able to consider the recent developments in the international situation, and obviously does not want to act rashly, such as Germany's resurgence of national power, the close cooperation between Britain and France to resist aggression, the active expansion of armaments by Britain and France, Poland's determination to safeguard its vital rights, the close relationship between Turkey, Greece, Romania, and various democracies, and the Egyptian government's decision to add air force bases to prevent attacks by Italian Libyan troops, and the dispatch of military delegations by Britain and France to Moscow. In view of this situation, the Italian government has agreed to establish a compromise solution for the Danzig issue, while waiting for a good opportunity for Germany and Italy to carry out the entire plan together.

<h3>British House of Commons Passes Motion to Adjourn After Heated Debate</h3>
<p>—Adjourned from August 4th to September 3rd—</p>
<p>Opposition Labour Party Proposes Amendment; British Prime Minister Considers it Disguised No-Confidence</p>
<p>(London) The government today moved that the House of Commons should adjourn from August 4th to September 3rd. Opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood immediately proposed an amendment, arguing that Parliament should reconvene on August 21st. Liberal Party leader Sinclair and Conservative Party leader Churchill both spoke in support of the amendment, but the amendment was ultimately defeated by 250 votes to 132, while the government motion proposed by Prime Minister Chamberlain was passed by 245 votes to 129. The Prime Minister pointed out that the opposition party's amendment was a disguised no-confidence vote, but the Prime Minister promised to convene Parliament if there was a sudden change in the European situation.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Explains Reasons for Motion</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister put forward the motion to adjourn, he declared that the date of this adjournment was shorter than usual, because the normal business of this session was delayed by urgent legislation. He meant that Parliament had dealt with all the necessary legislation for the time being, so the House of Commons could ensure that the country was now prepared to deal with sudden changes. Now there are at least two reasons why the government can reconvene Parliament during the adjournment if it feels necessary: ​​one is that if the government feels it is necessary, it must ask the House of Commons to pass the legislation currently being discussed; the other is that if the government wants to ask the House of Commons to pass the plans it has taken or will take to deal with unexpected situations. The adjournment motion also contains a clause stipulating that if the Speaker considers it in the public interest to reconvene early, it can be done.</p>
<p>Opposition Party Worries About Second Munich</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Labour Party leader Greenwood put forward an amendment, arguing that the House of Commons should reconvene on August 21st, because of the dangerous international situation. Greenwood also said that in addition to this feeling of fear, he also suspected that once the House of Commons adjourns, the government may make a wrong turn. If the people know that the National Assembly will reconvene in three weeks, their spirits will be greatly boosted and their confidence will be strengthened. Now, if a German is shot in Danzig, the world will enter a great war within 24 hours. In addition, the issue of the alliance between France, the Soviet Union, and Britain has not yet been resolved. After the adjournment of the National Assembly, how can we know that the government will not slack off on this matter? Here, he did not mean that the government had this intention, but that the government might inevitably take this path. As for the situation in the Far East, how can the opposition party know that it will not create a second Munich? Greenwood said urgently that the House of Commons should convene until the Moscow agreement is in hand. Greenwood also asked, if Hitler focuses on Yugoslavia, how will we deal with it? According to the information he has obtained, the situation in Yugoslavia may easily become another crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>Sinclair Supports Greenwood's Motion</p>
<p>Sir Sinclair spoke in support of Greenwood's motion, adjusting the Prime Minister's recent guarantee that the government will not make a major departure from its announced policies. However, his words have not been implemented in one place. May I ask if the meeting in Berchtesgaden has ever deviated from the announced policy? The decision there led Hitler to Prague. Now what I want to know is whether the House of Commons will have the opportunity to discuss publicly before the government makes major decisions such as Berchtesgaden?</p>
<p>Churchill Points Out Seriousness of Situation</p>
<p>Churchill then spoke to discuss the government's motion, saying that the government is safer when the House of Commons is in session. It would be regrettable if the situation became more serious and the House of Commons could not do anything. Churchill asked if anyone doubted that the highest test of determination will be made from now on, even if the highest test of force is not made. The House of Commons is currently an effective factor. It is harmful, pathetic, and shameful to act casually now. He firmly believes in the Prime Minister's loyalty, but his decisions may be different from others. Reconvening Parliament will indicate the extreme urgency of the situation, because the entire fleet has now been mobilized. This can also show that something important is happening and make Britain make a serious resolution to resist. He believes that the situation in Europe at this time is more critical than at this time last year, which can be seen from the fact that Germany now has a large number of soldiers waiting with their weapons. The German army has gathered heavily along the Polish border and has made various preparations for a rapid advance. All of this should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Chamberlain Refutes the Opposition's Arguments</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister spoke to refute this amendment, he mentioned that the Labour Party spokesperson suggested that Parliament should continue to convene for three weeks, at which time Britain could reach a compromise with the Soviet Union, saying that there were several warning phrases in the communique issued by Moscow. In the opinion of the government, it is best not to be too optimistic about ending these negotiations in a very short period of time. As for the arguments put forward by Churchill, they are all based on the serious nature of the situation. These arguments must inevitably lead people to the conclusion that the House of Commons should never adjourn. The Prime Minister then answered the argument that the danger of war could be reduced when the House of Commons was in session, recalling that the House of Commons was in session when the Austrian atrocity occurred, but it was still unable to find a way to stop it. On March 15th, when the German army began to advance towards Prague, the House of Commons held a debate in the afternoon, but there was no way to stop it. The Prime Minister said that the opposition party's amendment was self-contradictory, lacked a logical basis, and was a disguised no-confidence vote. He hoped that the House of Commons would reject it. Several members asked the Prime Minister to make some concessions for the sake of national unity. The Prime Minister then indicated in response to a certain question that Parliament would be reconvened if there was a sudden change in the European situation. As a result, the Labour Party's amendment was put to a vote and rejected by the public. The government's motion to adjourn was passed by a majority. The Prime Minister once considered this a vote of confidence in the government.</p>
<p>Many Conservative Party Members Abstain</p>
<p>(London) When the motion to adjourn Parliament was put to a vote in the House of Commons yesterday, more than 40 Conservative Party members of the government faction actually abstained. The political circles were shocked after hearing the news. Before the vote, Prime Minister Chamberlain had asked the government faction to support each member, saying, "If the House of Commons opposes the government's motion, it is a vote of no confidence in the government." The implication was, "Any member who does not vote in favor will be considered an opposition." However, in addition to the 25 far-rightists led by Churchill, more than a dozen Conservative Party members still abstained. Among them, Sir Roger Conant and Mr. Emery were the most well-known. Emery once served as Minister of the Colonies and was quite powerful in the party. Sir Roger Conant previously served as Prime Minister Chamberlain's private secretary from 1931 to 1936, and the Prime Minister was very dissatisfied with this. He has entrusted the leader of the government party to conduct an investigation to find out the reasons for these people's violation of party discipline and abstention. Regarding this level, political circles all said, "The government intends to re-elect the House of Commons in mid-November this year. It is worth noting that 40 Conservative Party members have expressed their opposition to the government at this time." (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Inspects by Plane</h3>
<p>Milan: Mussolini today flew his own plane to observe the start of the 150,000-strong Italian army participating in the exercise from the air. Mussolini then met with King Emmanuel near the exercise headquarters in Novara, Camarino Province. Then Mussolini flew back to Rimini, and the King inspected the line for a week. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, wrote an article in the Italian daily criticizing the exercise, saying that it boasted of defense and gap security across the Alps. Italy, like Germany, does not have such illusions and will find a way for its troops to break through them and restore freedom of military action. The exercises in the Po River basin are based on this possibility. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Declaration Issued Praising German Strength</h3>
<p>Today is the 25th anniversary of the outbreak of the European War. Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Erich Raeder, and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force General Hermann Göring have all issued declarations praising that today's Germany has extremely powerful military strength, which is more than that of 1914. General von Brauchitsch said, "If other countries order our country to resort to war, our country's army will deal with it with determination and courage, just like in 1914. To this day, Germany's strength has doubled compared to 1914. Based on the experience gained after the Great War, we deeply know that the enemy's resentment is very deep. We must strengthen ourselves to avoid being bullied. Führer Hitler has determined the political goals for which we must fight. Our country's political and military command has been unified. As a result, the military strength of our country's 80 million people will fight together in wartime, and we will obtain a guarantee for this." General Göring said, "The strength of the German Air Force is the best in the world and is prepared to carry out Führer Hitler's orders with lightning speed and unexpected power."

<h3>Chinese Firecrackers Continue to Be Exported to the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington Aviation Communication) The Bureau of Domestic and Foreign Trade recently issued statistics stating that last year, the United States imported firecrackers worth US$645,000, of which US$532,000 were imported from China. In 1937, the total import value was US$824,000, of which US$596,000 were imported from China. The comparison between the two shows that China's exports of firecrackers to the United States have not been seriously affected by the war. In 1937, there were 50 firecracker manufacturing factories in the United States, and their total output was worth US$3,160,000. It can be seen that imports from abroad only account for a very small part. These firecrackers are mostly set off on July 4th, the American Independence Day. (Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Polish Relations and the Danzig Question</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>London Dispatch</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain's diplomatic path and the methods of implementing it, to a purely objective person, seem disgusting, and if one were more relaxed, he might let out a cold laugh. But when we think that this concerns the future destiny of the whole world, and we are in it, then, for the most part, it will feel uncomfortable, and therefore feel that we must further endeavor from our own positions. In fact, even from the standpoint of pure British imperialist interests, Chamberlain's path and methods are still very dangerous. He is pushing the future of the British Empire step by step towards the edge of a cliff, seemingly unwilling to give up until he reaches his goal. This point is now felt by even those so-called "die-hard" figures in the British Conservative Party who are a little more clear-headed, and they have raised objections; and since opposition has been ineffective, they have given up on improving Chamberlain's policies. I have done a statistical analysis that, while not very precise, is generally accurate, and the results show that among the very few people in Britain who still support Chamberlain's policies, those who usually don't pay attention to international politics and are unclear-headed account for more than 80 percent; of the remaining two percent or so, the elderly (seventy years old is the minimum) account for half, and the other half are those with ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that Britain currently has only three paths to take in order to maintain the survival of her future empire; one is that Britain, the United States, and France unite and stand on one line to form an alliance; if this is not possible, then the second is to bring the Soviet Union and all the small, safe, and threatened countries together to form a united front; if they are unwilling to take this path either, then there is only one second path left, which is to strengthen the ties between Britain, France, and those countries bordering the Soviet Union. That way, in the event of a conflict with Germany and Italy, it would make it completely impossible for the Soviet Union to stand idly by.</p>
<p>The reason why the establishment of the Anglo-Polish and Anglo-Turkish pacts successively caused Germany and Italy to be greatly surprised lies in this. Therefore, when Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck came to London during the Anglo-Polish pact negotiations, his arrogance can truly be described as "unparalleled." And in my opinion, the importance that the British side attached to his visit was not even exceeded by the "state visit" of the French President last year. Beck repeatedly and publicly said that the establishment of the Anglo-Polish pact was insignificant to Poland; its greatest benefit was to Britain. Later, when Halifax turned the British unilateral guarantee of Poland's security into a mutual assistance pact, it can truly be said that he expended great effort. The price paid, including loans, etc., although already considerably high, in the final analysis, is still considered a major diplomatic gain for Britain. Any observer would agree with this, right?</p>
<p>Then, should the current and future relationship between Britain and Poland be able to proceed completely smoothly? But in fact, it is not so.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two negotiations being held between Britain and Poland in order to further consolidate the alliance: one is the negotiation between the British and Polish General Staffs in Warsaw; the other is the loan negotiation being held in London. And the focus of the dispute between Britain and Poland, which makes it difficult for the above two meetings to achieve satisfactory results, is the so-called Danzig question.</p>
<p>Danzig is indeed a big problem at the moment. But it is only an international problem, not a problem between Germany and Poland over the dispute over Danzig itself. In other words, if Germany and Poland were to negotiate this issue directly, then a solution might be found immediately. But once it is placed in the international arena, its complexity immediately increases countless times.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Strang, who is still stranded in Moscow, playing a key role for Britain in the Anglo-French-Soviet triangular negotiations, was in Warsaw more than a month ago, negotiating the Danzig issue with the Polish authorities. At that time, his task was to represent the British government and advise the Polish authorities to "peacefully" give up Danzig through British "mediation." This proposal was immediately rejected by Beck, and later, he even refused to discuss the Danzig issue with Strang again. In such a stalemate, Strang was suddenly recalled to his country, and then suddenly embarked on another journey to undertake a major task, flying to Moscow. Thus, the negotiations between Britain and Poland over Danzig were temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Not long after this negotiation ended, a large number of German Nazis openly entered the Free City of Danzig, carrying artillery and machine guns. At the same time, a large number of German troops gathered on the border of German East Prussia. Indeed, according to various reliable news and symbolic inferences at the time, the purpose of this move by Germany was only to test the international reaction; its conspiracy to seize Danzig should have been no earlier than August, and the preparations at the time were not yet mature. Then, the Polish army also gathered, and its authorities declared that in the event that Germany seized Danzig, whether by "internal seizure" or "external aggression," Poland was prepared to immediately send troops into Danzig. At the same time, Poland notified Britain of this attitude.</p>
<p>As a result, Prime Minister Chamberlain really panicked for a moment; in a short period of time, the clouds of war in Europe seemed to have filled the entire space. Chamberlain was very afraid that Poland would really fight with Germany, dragging Britain and France into it. So he quickly sought Poland's opinion to see if there was still a way to reconcile. Poland's answer was a categorical "no!" Her authorities told the British authorities that if Germany occupied Danzig, Poland would consider that the situation had reached a point where there was absolutely no compromise or concession, that it had harmed "Poland's major interests" and affected "Poland's independence and survival," and that she believed that it was worth fighting for.</p>
<p>We must remember; Hitler's gamble on Danzig was based on the assumption that Britain would not care, that Britain would not be willing to fight for Danzig. Therefore, he calculated that by making such a show of force, either Poland would succumb under British pressure; or Britain, out of fear of being implicated, would alienate Poland, in this way, a big crack would appear in the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance pact.</p>
<p>At that time, people inside Britain fully understood Hitler's customary diplomatic tactics. So everyone unanimously pressured Prime Minister Chamberlain to quickly express Britain's attitude. But in fact, Prime Minister Chamberlain had already expressed his attitude more than once, that Britain was not only unwilling to fight for the Danzig issue, but also that if Hitler could compromise on other issues, Britain could even be confident of pressuring Poland to give up Danzig. Then, what else could be expressed? However, the pressure from the British public at the time was really too great, and even a stubborn person like Prime Minister Chamberlain could not but give in. However, on the eve of issuing the statement, he still finally advised Poland to consider: sending the original draft of the statement to Poland first to see. At this time, Poland's attitude was extremely stubborn, and she said to Britain; whether to issue a statement or not is Britain's own business, issue it or not, Poland leaves it to Britain to consider; but Poland wants to firmly tell Britain that if Germany occupies Danzig, Poland will definitely start military action, even if Britain and France stand idly by, Poland will not care.</p>
<p>What is said here is the famous declaration that Prime Minister Chamberlain finally issued, that Britain would do its utmost to support Poland's position on the Danzig issue. As soon as this declaration was issued, the clouds of war over Danzig immediately dispersed.</p>
<p>Here, we should note a very important point, which is; what Chamberlain feared most was, of course, that Germany and Poland would really fight, drawing Britain and France into the vortex; but what he feared even more severely was that Germany and Poland would completely collude with each other, keeping the Soviet Union out, and then Germany, Italy, and Poland would join together to demand that Britain and France divide the colonies equally.</p>
<p>This spring, Hitler said to Beck in person; Poland today is already a "first-class power," but like Germany and Italy, it lacks colonies, so it should also be listed among the "powers without colonies" and has the right to demand colonies and "living space" from Britain and France, but there is one big prerequisite, which is: first let Danzig merge into Germany.</p>
<p>Although the negotiations at that time did not achieve concrete results, the possibility of Germany and Poland reaching a compromise over Danzig always existed. Even after the establishment of the Anglo-Polish pact, Poland's diplomacy on the Danzig issue always had a dual nature. To Britain, Poland said that she would never give up Danzig, and was prepared to fight if necessary, with no room for discussion; but between Germany and Poland, negotiations to find a compromise solution to the Danzig issue never stopped for a day. What do these facts show? It shows that even if Poland were to give up Danzig, she would do so voluntarily in order to obtain a price, and would not allow Britain and France to do a favor and offer it to Germany; Poland, in view of the precedent of the Munich Conference, did not want to repeat the mistakes of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>This so-called Danzig issue, if it continues to ferment like this, will of course cause a "crisis" again. And Germany plans, in any case, to present it as one of this year's victorious gains at the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in September. Therefore, the period during which it can be stretched and maneuvered is really very short. Therefore, Britain and Poland quickly began negotiations between the General Staffs as soon as possible, and Anglo-Polish loan negotiations. These two negotiations were originally stipulated in the Anglo-Polish pact.</p>
<p>Regarding the former negotiation, the British military authorities strongly advocated an early result; but Poland's attitude was very cold, and she insisted on completing the loan negotiation first. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain used the completion of the loan negotiation as a tool to force Poland to first agree to Britain's solution to the Danzig issue. Of course, Chamberlain still wanted to start negotiations with Germany again recently; then, the Danzig issue is again a great bargaining chip. However, so far, Poland still insists on absolutely rejecting Britain's intervention in the Danzig issue. Therefore, these two negotiations, which are being conducted at the same time, have both fallen into a semi-dead state.</p>
<p>Most people in Britain today oppose Chamberlain's approach. The major premise is that they believe that appeasement with Germany is getting worse and worse, and that if things continue like this, it will inevitably lead to war. The second is that they believe that Poland would rather fail to secure a loan than have Britain interfere in Danzig. Therefore, if the Anglo-Polish negotiations fail and Germany and Poland turn to approach each other successfully, then Britain's great disaster at that time will be unimaginable. France's attitude is also the same, so she not only urges Britain to complete the loan negotiations as soon as possible, but she is willing to fully fulfill her promise to Poland and lend 600 million francs to Poland first.</p>
<p>These days, Prime Minister Chamberlain has accomplished nothing and has been blamed by domestic and foreign sources, presenting a very annoyed state. He placed all the responsibility for the failure on the parliament and public opinion institutions. He said that if it were not for the constant questioning in the British Parliament and the extensive publication in newspapers and magazines, his secret diplomacy and special path could have been successful. Therefore, he is already planning what methods he can use to clamp down on public opinion, and he also plans to order cabinet members to avoid discussing international events as much as possible when answering questions in Parliament. But in a country like Britain with such a strong democratic atmosphere, all of this will of course be in vain and will instead become a laughing stock.</p>
<p>Soon, the period of the parliament's regular recess will arrive again. It is said that during this period, Chamberlain, holding great hope, plans to take the opportunity to try his great diplomatic strokes again. Let's wait and see. (July 21)</p>
<h3>A True Record of a Trip to the Southwest (Continued)</h3>
<p>The passengers who traveled by ship from Hong Kong to Haiphong could get along well after two days of ephemeral life. Although they could not help each other much, they could still take care of each other. Therefore, before the ship arrived, everyone decided to form a small group to take care of each other when they encountered an inspection. After the scattered luggage was unloaded, the large luggage was handed over to the travel agency (because the Haiphong hotels were doing too well and there were no people soliciting customers on the ship). Firstly, the travel agency was more familiar with customs inspection procedures when picking up passengers, and most of them were Cantonese, so they could barely communicate in language. Secondly, having more people to take care of things would also help with sorting during the inspection. It is said that pickpockets are most numerous in the section from the ship to the customs warehouse (i.e., the place waiting for inspection). Therefore, after handing the luggage to the travel agency, the individual must still follow it. According to the previous rules, after the luggage and passengers entered the customs warehouse, the doors and windows were all closed, waiting quietly for the customs officers to inspect. Sometimes it did take more than one or two hours. If it was a hot day and you were locked in a house where you couldn't see your fingers, the suffering was really unbearable. Now the method has been changed so that the luggage of ships arriving in the morning is inspected after 2 p.m., and those arriving in the afternoon are inspected the next day. During the waiting period, the luggage is locked in the customs warehouse, and the passengers can move freely outside. During the inspection, there are many people and hands, and the situation is extremely chaotic. If one or two people are carrying many pieces of luggage, it is indeed not easy to take care of them, because each piece of luggage must be placed on the inspection table and opened. After opening, it is slightly turned over (most of them will not turn it over completely unless they intentionally want to make things difficult for you), and then you must leave the inspection table and move it out of the door. There is absolutely no time to sort it out calmly. At the same time, the shouts and urging make the passengers' emotions extremely chaotic, and the crooks take the opportunity to act. At this time, it is best to completely open the locks on all the luggage in the group, leave a part of the people to guard and wait for the inspection, and the rest of the people are divided into two groups, one group is responsible for transporting the scattered luggage to the outside of the customs warehouse, and the other group selects an open space outside the gate to be responsible for keeping the scattered luggage that is sent out. After everyone's luggage has been completely inspected, then start sorting it out. Generally, new goods that are not large in quantity (two or three pieces) will not be taxed. Matches are monopolized by the French government in Vietnam, so it is best not to bring them. If you bring them, they will at most be confiscated. Previously, there were occasional occurrences of fining one dollar for each match, but now they mostly just throw them into their specially prepared small drawers and that's it. If you encounter new goods that are large in quantity, the customs officer will put them aside. At this time, the people guarding and waiting for the inspection should pay special attention to the number of items and the location where they are placed, so that there is room for negotiation and return later. The chances of getting them back are high, but you must be good at explaining.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to mention the situation of taxation. If you bring a dozen or a large quantity of new goods, it is still best to submit a declaration and pay taxes. According to the regulations of the Vietnamese Customs, national goods are subject to a transit tax of 1%, and Western goods are subject to 4%. However, if they are not directly transported from Chinese territory, they are all subject to a tax of 4%. At the same time, the items that passengers carry with them are now also allowed to be taxed at a uniform rate of only 1%. Previously, the Haiphong Chinese Consulate had a passenger guidance center that also acted as an agent for reporting customs affairs, but it has now been closed. Therefore, if you are carrying a large quantity of goods in transit, it is best to contact the visa office in Hong Kong first to avoid delaying your days in Haiphong. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Talks About How to Choose Departments and Schools (Continued 4) Experience and Environment as Selection Criteria Are Indispensable Conditions, It Is Very Reasonable to Go to School and Find a Job According to Personal Interests</h3>
<p>(2) Personal interests, because of individual differences, each person's interests in worldly things, whether academic or non-academic, are often not the same. It is certainly very reasonable to use interest as a standard for choosing university departments and lifelong careers. This so-called interest is not purely based on learning interest. If you are interested in a certain subject in middle school, you cannot determine that it can be a lifelong career. The first section of this article discusses the principle of being good at subjects, and this has already been explained, so interests in other things besides subjects are also important references. For example, students like to be the president of the student union, like to give speeches, like to appreciate nature, like to contribute to newspapers and magazines, like to do experiments in the laboratory, like to read books in the library, and other trivial interests, etc., are all related to going to school and choosing departments and lifelong careers, and must not be ignored. Darwin liked to play with insects when he was young, Edison liked to collect old machine parts when he was young, and the Prime Minister liked to fight injustice when he was young. These are all manifestations of interest, that is, expressions of what is close to nature. Successful people are like this, and ordinary people are also like this. In my personal experience, when I was young, I liked to invite neighborhood children to my home to open a school. Looking back, I still feel interested now. You just need to think back to when you were young, you must have had your own interesting things to play with. If you can't think of anything, it's mostly because you didn't pay attention, of course, there are also those who didn't have the opportunity to express themselves, and therefore haven't been discovered. Legend has it that Wang Xizhi's family had a maid who was extremely clumsy in doing things and was not liked by the family. One day, Wang Xizhi went out to meet guests, and there was a piece of calligraphy in the study that had not been finished. The maid suddenly touched her spirit and continued writing a few words. When Xizhi returned to the room and saw it, he was very pleased, so he taught her to practice writing and no longer looked down on her. Therefore, later generations said that in Wang Xizhi's family, there was no one who couldn't write. There are endless careers in the world, and there are always things that are close to your temperament. The same is true for major departments. If you have found that you are interested in a certain thing, you sometimes cannot simply determine which subject is close to your nature. For example, when you are in school, you like to be the president of the student union. On the surface, it is easy to think that you are suitable for studying politics. In fact, people who like to be responsible in small groups are suitable for politics, but also suitable for studying personnel management, suitable for operating industry and commerce, and suitable for being the head of a school or institution. Therefore, there are many manifestations of interest that must be analyzed and referenced with other conditions before you can determine which subject is close to your nature.</p>
<p>(3) Experience and environment, wisdom and talent, must be enlightened before they can be discovered. Therefore, experience and environment are indispensable conditions for choosing a department. The so-called experience refers to the things that an individual has learned, done, or been exposed to in the past. Those with more experience in literature are suitable for studying literature, and those with more experience in science are suitable for studying science. Mr. Liang Rengong had read many Chinese books in Wanmu Caotang before he was twenty years old, and he was very fond of history books, so later his contribution to historiography was particularly great. Mr. Hu Shi especially liked to read novels when he was young, so later he advocated the vernacular literature movement. A person, when young, has more contact with a certain aspect of knowledge due to a certain opportunity, and unconsciously, his emotions are affected by it, and later he will go that way. Therefore, young people who aspire to go to school must experience their personal past experience. If they have more materials in a certain subject, it can be used as an important reference for choosing a department. In terms of environment, the family background and the community where they are located are of great importance. In the past, China had so-called "scholarly families" and "farming and reading families." In the former society where "those who excel in learning become officials," reading and becoming an official were linked. Reading was a preparation for becoming an official, and becoming an official was the result of reading. The father became an official, the son read books, and the son wanted to become an official after reading books. This sentence "scholarly family" is not wrong at all. The books that were read at that time were simple and did not require many facilities and experiments, so reading and farming were also very easy to link together. Although society has changed now, the family's occupational background is still very related to the future of the children going to school. Although everyone has a share in studying, and reading is no longer the specialty of scholarly families, it is best for the children of a commercial family not to choose the departments of literature, history, philosophy, education, or politics, because the mind and spirit required to study these subjects cannot be cultivated by a business family. If you force yourself to learn, you will not be able to achieve good results. Young people from business families can study commerce, law, economics, and medicine. The family background and the subjects they study should always have a considerable match, just like brightly colored clothes that are not suitable for every woman to wear. The colors that are suitable for people with fair skin are not suitable for people with dark skin. If you force yourself to wear them, you will inevitably "follow suit." The relationship between family background and subjects is not only about inherent habits. The future way out is also related. In a certain family, you can learn certain similar departments, and the opportunity to work in the future will naturally be easier. My opinion is not to say that "the son of a scholar will always be a scholar" and "the son of a worker will always be a worker." Guanzi's disciple Zhi had such a proposition in one article. In today's era, I don't think so. However, I think it is quite correct that an individual's subject should not be too far from the family's occupation. Furthermore, the social environment in which an individual is located is also very important. It is difficult for a person who grows up in an urban society to study agriculture to achieve better results than a person who studies agriculture in a rural society. What they have seen and heard in the society where they grew up is richer, and after graduation, the problems they encounter and the things they should do will naturally still be in the society where they are located. Therefore, choosing a department cannot be too far away from your own society.</p>

<h3>Kunming Ball News: Southwest Basketball Team Defeats Aviation Team; Tang Yin and Yin Both Serve Southwest</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) The Southwest Basketball Team and the Aviation School's 13th Class Basketball Team played a basketball game last month at the Yunda Stadium outside the North Gate. The Southwest lineup, in addition to national team players Tang and Yin, also included Yang Shaobo of the Guard Brigade, who had emerged victorious in previous matches and had not encountered opponents. The Aviation School's 13th Class was a rising star. After the start of the game, the Aviation School's 13th Class launched a fierce attack. Southwest relied on Yin Hongxian to sit firmly in the rear, allowing them to turn danger into safety. In the first half, Southwest led by one point, 13 to 12. After the break, the Aviation School took advantage of Southwest's personnel changes and launched a strong counterattack. Tang Baokun saw the situation was not good, and Yang Shaobo reappeared on the field, and the situation improved as expected. Yin Hongxiang's shooting was like a god. As a result, Southwest won 36 to 30.</p>

<h3>Guerrillas Active Along Transportation Lines; Destroyed Seven Highway Bridges; Wreckage of Henglin Train Lies on the Roadside; Missing Japanese Sentries: Two Killed, One Injured; Witnessed by Returning Shanghai Passengers</h3>
<p>Dalu Bao reports that, according to travelers returning to Shanghai after passing through large portions of Jiangsu guerrilla areas, Japanese authorities have implemented special precautions along the railway line connecting to the concessions here to counter the guerrillas' activity. Despite the Japanese precautions, guerrillas remained very active last week, destroying bridges, disrupting traffic, and blowing up trains and vehicles. A certain foreigner arriving from eastern Jiangsu Province claimed that the number of Japanese armed guards along the Jinghu Road and Sujia Road areas, which are frequently attacked by guerrillas, has greatly increased. He traveled by bus from Changshu to Suzhou and saw seven bridges along the road that had been completely or partially destroyed by guerrillas. Temporary wooden bridges had been erected where repairs were incomplete. This shows how active the guerrillas are, because Suzhou is only 30 miles from Changshu, and the Japanese and puppet troops must have been carefully defending it. However, the guerrillas were able to burn or blow up bridges at will, causing major traffic disruptions. Another foreigner described the circumstances of the train from Shanghai to Suzhou being bombed by guerrillas last Saturday. He said that he originally wanted to take the train that departed from Shanghai early on Saturday morning, but he arrived at the station too early and the ticket purchase was delayed. He had to take the train the next morning, but this rescheduling may have saved his life. He took the train the next morning and arrived at Henglin near Suzhou, where he saw the wreckage of the train that had departed the previous day lying on the roadside. The stations along the way, where Japanese troops were not seen even two or three weeks ago, are now fully guarded. When the train arrived in Suzhou, many passengers were questioned and some were searched. Another traveler arriving from towns west of Shanghai spoke of Japanese soldiers burning many farmhouses in the outskirts. Reportedly, after three Japanese sentries went missing on July 29, Japanese soldiers immediately set fire to the houses. They later found that two of the three sentries had been killed, and the other was lying on the roadside with severe gunshot wounds. A team of Japanese soldiers was ordered to search the area, allegedly to search for the guerrillas who had ambushed the Japanese sentries, but they found nothing except three people who were strong and healthy and recognized by others as ordinary farmers. Gunfire has erupted frequently in the suburbs of Shanghai and the towns west of Shanghai recently.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper's Repair of Electrical Wiring Accidental Triggering of Alarm</h3>
<p>At around 2:30 PM yesterday, the electrical equipment of this newspaper experienced a minor breakdown. Workers were promptly instructed to repair it. Unexpectedly, the workers mistakenly identified the circuit and triggered the alarm bell. As a result, the police department, thinking that an accident had occurred, immediately dispatched patrol cars and armed detectives to investigate. At the same time, this newspaper also automatically discovered the situation and sent an apology to the police department.</p>
<h3>Western Woman's Legal Tender Confiscated; Japanese Side Fabricates Pretext; Claims Limit of 500 in Cash Applies to All Travelers</h3>
<p>Zi Lin Bao reports that the Japanese side received news reporters yesterday (the 2nd), asking about a Western woman who had been searched when she left Tianjin and whose legal tender had been confiscated. The embassy spokesperson said that searching foreign travelers entering and exiting Qingdao or any other North China port can be considered a legitimate procedure, and the responsible military officer determines the outcome. Travelers are allowed to bring 500 Japanese yen in cash into North China ports. If the limit is exceeded, a draft must be obtained. This rule has been in effect since May and applies to all travelers, not just British expatriates.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side, Together with Police, Arrests Two Chinese</h3>
<p>She Wen She reports that at around 2:00 PM one day, plainclothes Japanese personnel again went to the Public Concession and, together with personnel from the police department, rushed to a certain number in Fuxin Lane, Lane 920, Xinzha Road (i.e., Fukang Lane), and arrested two residents. It is reported that the arrested were postal workers. The reason for the arrest is unknown.</p>

<h3>Four Banks Ordered to Form Committee to Manage Domestic Remittances; Aimed at Preventing Outflow of Funds from the Interior; At the Same Time Encouraging the Transfer of Funds from Shanghai to the Interior; Whether a Branch Will Be Established in Shanghai Is Undecided</h3>
<p>In order to control domestic remittance business, prevent the outflow of legal tender from the interior, and encourage the inflow of funds to the interior, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China to organize a domestic remittance management committee to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior and encourage the transfer of funds from Shanghai to the interior. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forward and Reverse Remittances Have Different Characteristics</p>
<p>Remittance is the clearing of debts between two places, without the transfer of cash, but using one party's claim to repay the other party's debt. Domestic remittance is divided into "forward remittance" and "reverse remittance." In forward remittance, the debtor pays the money to the remitting bank and entrusts the remitting bank to transfer it to its agent bank in another location to pay the money to the creditor to clear the debt. Therefore, the initiative of the remittance comes from the debtor. In reverse remittance, the creditor issues a draft to the debtor, ordering the debtor to pay the money to the remitting bank's agent bank in another location. The creditor first sells the draft to the remitting bank to obtain cash and recover his claim. The initiative of the remittance comes from the creditor.</p>
<p>National Banks and Money Shops Handle Remittances</p>
<p>The prerequisite for banks and money shops to undertake this kind of remittance is that they must have branch offices established in domestic locations. Ordinary remittance locations are limited to the location where branch offices are located. However, banks can also enter into remittance contracts with peer banks in other locations, such as Zhejiang Local Bank, Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Jiangxi Yumin Bank, etc., which have all entered into contracts with each other to handle remittances. However, domestic remittances of various banks and money shops all use "forward remittance" and are divided into "mail transfer," "telegraphic transfer," "electronic transfer," "bill of exchange," "current account remittance," and "traveler's checks." As for "reverse remittance," it is mostly used when drawing bills. Drawing bills is also one of the businesses of banks and money shops.</p>
<p>Establish Committee to Manage Remittances</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to organize a domestic remittance management committee to implement the management of domestic remittance business. The committee is located in the headquarters of the four banks in Chongqing. Branches are established throughout the country, attached to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China. Remittances from the interior to the occupied areas of the coast, such as Shanghai, are limited to the purchase of daily necessities and should first apply to the remittance management committee, stating the purpose, amount, location of remittance, and supporting documents from the merchant, in order to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior.</p>
<p>Encourage Funds to Flow into the Interior</p>
<p>In addition, the inflow of funds to the interior is encouraged. The Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China provide various conveniences for remittances from Shanghai to the interior. It is stipulated that remittances to the interior, regardless of location, are exempt from remittance fees and only charged a handling fee of one yuan per thousand national currency, and can be paid with Shanghai-general remittance instruments. The interior can receive the full amount of cash. If entrust the Bank of Communications to remit the banknotes of Tianjin, Shandong, Hubei to the interior, in addition to being free of charge, no handling fee will be charged. Since the implementation, remittances from Shanghai to the interior have surged.</p>
<p>Strictly Restrict Remittances from the Interior to Shanghai</p>
<p>A reporter from New Sound News learned from banking circles yesterday that Shanghai is one of the occupied areas, so there is no need to set up a domestic remittance management committee. As for remittances from the interior to Shanghai, in the current situation, about 1,400 yuan in cash in Kunming, Chongqing, and other places is equivalent to 1,000 yuan in Shanghai. Remittances from the interior are cash, and the recipients in Shanghai are remittances. After the establishment of the domestic remittance management committee, remittances from the interior to Shanghai cannot be entrusted to banks, money shops, or post offices for remittance without the review and approval of the domestic remittance management committee. Remittances to Shanghai are particularly strict.</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch Only Provides Inquiries</p>
<p>According to banking circles, the headquarters of the management committee will begin work within the week. As for the Shanghai side, according to inquiries from the reporter of this newspaper to the person in charge of banking circles last night, it is learned that the Shanghai four banks have not yet received a formal order from the headquarters, so it is not yet certain whether a branch will be established in Shanghai. According to the person in charge's observation of the nature of this measure, its main purpose is to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior. Therefore, strict management is imposed on remittances from Chongqing and other places to Shanghai. In other words, all those who have been approved by the general and branch committees of domestic remittances in Chongqing and other interior areas to remit funds to Shanghai, the Shanghai branch will naturally pay accordingly. Therefore, the examination and approval of whether to remit or not is purely in the hands of the general and branch committees in the interior. The Shanghai side only provides inquiries for the general and branch committees. The Shanghai four banks are waiting for orders from the headquarters before complying. The person in charge also said that the government is still very convenient in terms of procedures for transferring funds from Shanghai to the interior and developing production in the interior.</p>
<h3>Cattle Barred from Entering Shanghai</h3>
<p>Cattle from the suburbs being transported into the concessions are now being blocked by the puppet regime. The day before yesterday, more than ten head of cattle were being slaughtered on Dongchang Road in Pudong, intending to cross the river and be transported into the isolated island, but they were blocked and sent back. Yesterday morning, eight head of cattle were being slaughtered at South Wharf, intending to cross the river, but they were detained by the puppet "water police team" and the people and cattle were escorted to the puppet "judicial branch." They were not released until late.</p>
<h3>Terrorists in Western Shanghai Disarmed by Italian Defense Forces; Tense Situation Yesterday Morning; Almost a Conflict; But Subdued by Italian Troops; 26 People Detained</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the situation was tense at the Wujiaochang on Bailinan Road this morning (the 3rd) because armed terrorists, reportedly members of the "Special Task Force" supporting Wang Jingwei, almost clashed with the Italian Marines outside the house at 1081 Jisfeier Road. The house was formerly the headquarters of the Chinese contingent of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and Cao Yi Primary School is now located there. According to unofficial sources, there were 40 or 50 terrorists. These people openly resisted the Italian defense forces against the wall of the house, but eventually succumbed and were disarmed and loaded into an Italian military truck and taken to the Italian military headquarters. Official sources said that a total of 26 people were detained and military Mauser pistols and a large number of weapons were seized. Eyewitnesses also said that there was a rickshaw loaded with a large number of hand grenades, which was being escorted to the Italian military headquarters. It is reported that the terrorists were dispatched from the headquarters at 76 Jisfeier Road, the former residence of Chen Diaoyuan, and the headquarters was recently located in a house on Yidingpan Road and recently moved to 76 Jisfeier Road. It is generally believed that these terrorists are the thugs who recently committed violence in the China-America Daily and the Da Evening News. Just after 9:00 this morning, 40 or 50 people suddenly appeared outside 1081 Jisfeier Road, some wearing long robes and others wearing Western suits, all holding sharp knives, military Mauser pistols, and hand grenades. One of them entered Cao Yi Primary School and said that they would change this house into a headquarters and ordered the school to move out within nine days. According to eyewitnesses, the "Avenue" police were very respectful to these terrorists. Everyone saw them.</p>
<p>The Italian military authorities received the news and dispatched Italian Marines to rush to the scene. Some said that there were as many as 200 Italian soldiers, while officials said that there were 50, surrounding the house and ordering the terrorists to surrender. The terrorists refused and demonstrated with military Mauser pistols against the wall. The two sides were deadlocked until 11:37, when the terrorists finally succumbed. At that time, the situation was tense and nearby shops were closed in a hurry. There were few pedestrians on the road except for a few curious onlookers.</p>
<p>It was also learned that a total of 16 people were detained by the Italian soldiers. After investigation, it was found that they were officials of the "Avenue" municipal government and were all released at around 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>

<h3>Vigorous Market Chips, Bank Deposits Surge, Promising Results from the Remittance System, and Substantial Outstanding Discounts Handled by the Four Banks</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Financial Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>After the Joint Bank Reserve Committee handled interbank remittances, all banks and firms provided assets to apply for withdrawals from the committee. The committee assessed the value of the collateral based on the actual needs of each bank and firm, allowing them to withdraw remittances up to 70% of the assessed value. Member Qian Zhuang of the Money Trade Association collectively recognized withdrawals of 10 million yuan, which has been reviewed and completed by the association and submitted the recognized amounts for each firm to the Bank Reserve Committee. The recognized amounts for each commercial bank have also been assumed. Due to the conversion of principal and interest payments of unified public bonds into remittances by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, the circulation of remittance instruments has surged. The payment institutions for these remittances have all been centralized in the Bank Reserve Committee.</p>
<p>Market Increase in Cash Chips</p>
<p>In order to regulate the funds of the same industry and facilitate the payment of legal tender deposits below 500 yuan, the Silver and Money Trade Associations consulted with the Central, China, and Communications Banks to convert the 22 million yuan of remittance funds deposited by each bank and firm in the Silver and Money Trade Association's reserve at the end of June into legal tender in twelve weekly installments for turnover. Since the implementation on July 4th, five installments have been released every week until August 1st, totaling 9 million yuan of legal tender, meaning that the legal tender chips in the market have increased by 9 million yuan. All banks and firms are following the previously agreed-upon method to withdraw legal tender from the reserve. It is reported that the sixth installment is scheduled for payment on August 8th.</p>
<p>The Four Banks Continue to Handle Discounts</p>
<p>In order to promote the circulation of capital for domestic financial, agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial sectors, the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks established a Joint Discount Committee in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order. The scope of discounts is divided into (1) mortgage, (2) re-mortgage, (3) discount, and (4) loan. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The Shanghai Discount Committee continues to handle discount work. As of the end of last month, the outstanding loan balance was reported to be 14 million yuan. However, future discounts will be handled by the Silver and Money Trade Associations. The association's announced (1) discount rate of 7.5% and (2) loan interest of 2.5% have remained unchanged, which is sufficient proof of the stability of Shanghai's financial market.</p>
<p>Financial Markets Have Stabilized</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday that Shanghai's financial market has stabilized. For example, the black market exchange rate has eased, gold prices have fallen, the securities black market has surged, remittance spreads have narrowed, and the interbank lending rates and various interest rates of the Bank Reserve Committee have remained largely unchanged. The deposit and withdrawal frenzy at various banks and firms has completely subsided. Since this week, bank and firm deposits have increased. Although Ma Dian stipulated deposit and withdrawal methods, withdrawals by depositors have greatly decreased. After consideration, various banks and firms have decided on methods for using excess funds. Recently, remittances to the interior have surged, and speculative transactions have decreased compared to before. This is truly a good phenomenon for the Shanghai market.</p>
<p>Good Suggestions for Managing Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>According to a financial magnate yesterday, there are two reasons for the impact of foreign exchange: (1) Foreign banks should no longer provide foreign exchange when the exchange rate is shortened, which is commonly known as "having a price but no market." (2) The black market is restless and deliberately creates mystery in an attempt to speculate, giving the Japanese an opportunity to take advantage. However, in my opinion, the central government has established a sound plan. Before implementation, it should adopt public opinion as much as possible as a supplementary measure. The best approach is that Shanghai no longer provides foreign exchange to various industries and instead, the head offices of the Central, China, and Communications Banks in Chongqing should carefully provide it. Chongqing is the governing body, and the Hong Kong branches of the three banks are the external liaison offices. All approved quotas should be subject to the instructions of the Chongqing head office. If this method is implemented, no matter what conspiracies villains may devise, they will have no chance to succeed.</p>
<h3>It is Reported That the Zhejiang Authorities Have Approved the Opening of Aojiang</h3>
<p>However, the River is Shallow and Narrow, and Large Vessels Cannot Enter</p>
<p>The original shipping routes to Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, in eastern Zhejiang, included the Oujiang, Aojiang, Chumen, and Pingyang Rivers. Before the war, they were all operated by domestic ships. Since August 13th, the authorities have strengthened defense, so Aojiang Estuary and others are still absolutely prohibited. It is reported that a flexible approach has been approved to open Aojiang Estuary, which is more than a hundred miles away from Oujiang Estuary, allowing foreign ships to navigate. From there, it can reach Pingyang, Chumen, and Wenzhou. However, the waterway at the estuary is shallow and narrow, and only ships under 1,500 tons, such as Baoli and Haifu, can navigate. It is reported that shipping companies are currently completing registration procedures to operate.</p>
<p>Shanghai Ships Stalled in Zhenhai</p>
<p>The Far East Hana ship left Shanghai for Zhenhai on the morning of the 2nd. The Sino-Italian De Ping ship left for Zhenhai yesterday morning. Currently, ships remaining in Zhenhai include Baoli (Yi Hua Foreign Company), Du Guo Zhu (Li He Shipping Department), and four others.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Lighterage</p>
<p>Currently, the Ningbo Defense Department no longer restricts the exit of women and children. Able-bodied men who can provide a 2,000 yuan shop guarantee and return to Ningbo within two weeks are also allowed to exit. There are no restrictions on those traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo. As a result, the number of passengers entering and leaving has suddenly increased. For example, the Shang Ban Mou Fu ship came to Shanghai with more than 2,000 passengers. As a result, lighterage vessels are in short supply, and ships are delayed in Zhenhai.</p>
<h3>Following Smedley, a Beautiful Woman Writer Goes to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Praising the Work of 50,000 Students in Jin and Shaanxi Provinces, Engaged in Political Organization and Guerrilla Tactics</p>
<p>According to the Mainland News, the American female writer Ms. He Mo came to Shanghai last November and transferred to the Chinese mainland. After a period of nine months, Ms. He is the first female writer to go to the front lines in China after Smedley. She has recently returned to Shanghai. Yesterday (the 6th), she told reporters that she followed Dr. Bai Lang of the Wuhu Church and entered the mainland via Wenzhou, passed through Nanchang to Guilin, encountered a major bombing, and then arrived in Chongqing. She traveled with Dr. Luo Ai of Jinling University by truck via Xi'an to Yan'an. She heard that the situation of refugees in Zhengzhou was not good, so she traveled along the Longhai Road on the banks of the Yellow River from Xi'an. Japanese planes bombed between Luoyang and Zhengzhou, but there were many people along the way.</p>
<p>Traveling East</p>
<p>She did not even glance at the shells whistling past and exploding one or two miles away. Ms. He enthusiastically talked about her trip to the secret headquarters of General Yan Xishan near the east bank of the Yellow River in Jin Province. According to her, it is a joke to say that Chinese students are doing nothing. There are now 50,000 students in Jin and Shaanxi provinces who are studying political organization and guerrilla tactics. Their training program is similar to the Red Army School in Yan'an, but without the radical thinking of the students in Yan'an.</p>
<p>More Practical</p>
<p>Engaged in excellent work, these students have endured all kinds of hardships from all over China. They are very distressed when they arrive, but soon resume a vigorous life. Many people in Jin and Shaanxi provinces live in caves. The countryside is vast, the hills undulate, and villages are rare, but the population is large, agricultural production is scarce, and food is not in short supply. Yan's subordinates have ample food for mountain warfare. Travelers on the road need not worry about shortages of necessities, but the area urgently needs relief funds, medical personnel, and medicine. Farmers organize stretcher teams to carry the wounded. Hospitals are set up in mountain caves, but lack surgical equipment. There is no road to southwestern Jin Province. The Japanese army's well-equipped transportation facilities have been completely destroyed. A certain medical school in Linfen has established its headquarters on the west bank of the Yellow River, with 200 students working to the best of their ability. Nearby military hospitals benefit from this. The most amazing place Ms. He saw in Jin Province was Jixian, which had been lost, burned, recovered, and then rebuilt twice.</p>
<p>When she arrived in Jixian, the Japanese army was twenty miles away, and the county was already in its third reconstruction. In June, Ms. He arrived in Yan'an, originally planning to go to Beiping, but then gave up. The Eighth Route Army provided a truck to send her to Xi'an. On the way to Chongqing, she passed many model villages built by the New Life Movement for the homeless. The villagers are all self-reliant. While staying in Chongqing, she saw American relief organizations using funds raised in the United States to provide relief to orphans and refugees. A day or two after arriving in Chongqing, she received news of a night raid and witnessed intense air combat. She then flew to Hong Kong and transferred to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Remittances for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Solicitation Committee received a letter yesterday from Mr. Geng Jiatuo, an overseas Chinese in France: "Dear Sirs, I have received your letter of April 6th, along with the receipt and five refugee adoption certificates, which have been duly received. I am now enclosing a check for 300 francs for the second half of this year, July, August, September, October, November, and December, for my personal relief of four refugees, as well as funds raised from friends, including 300 francs from Mrs. Liu Qiaosheng of the Spanish Embassy, and 144 francs each from Mr. Wang Zhennan and his wife, totaling 1,176 francs. Please check and acknowledge receipt, and please send the receipts directly to each donor. If there are any subsequent donations, they will be sent at any time. Furthermore, donors here pay the donations in full at the time of adoption, so refugee adoption certificates do not seem necessary. I have cut off the last page with the solicitation of refugee adoption methods and sent it to friends to encourage donations. I am now returning the original five certificates in a separate envelope. Please check accordingly."</p>
<h3>Affected by Rising Raw Material Prices, Industrial Recovery Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>Production Decreases in Industries Relying on Imported Raw Materials, Rising Prices Affect Sales, It is Better to Sell Existing Materials. The Industry Department of the Public Works Department reported in July that the peak of industrial recovery in the city seems to have passed. On the one hand, due to seasonal factors, the output of certain industries has decreased. On the other hand, restrictions on withdrawals, foreign exchange shortages, lack of raw materials, and the blockade of seaports all affect factory production. Factories north of the Suzhou River are less affected because their products are sold to various parts of the lower Yangtze River. However, the biggest difficulty faced by the industry as a whole is the rising price of raw materials. Factories manufacturing daily necessities whose raw materials come from abroad, such as rubber shoe factories (three-quarters of raw materials purchased from abroad), enamel factories (seven-tenths of raw materials purchased from other ports), cigarette factories, thermos factories, and glass factories, have seen their production decrease. Since the initial tightening of foreign exchange, factories once raised the prices of their goods by 10% to 15%, but later, realizing that a further price increase would inevitably affect sales, they had to implement reduced working hours or shutdowns. Some manufacturers who purchased raw materials before the foreign exchange shrinkage are unwilling to manufacture goods and would rather sell the raw materials for profit, which will inevitably add to the unemployed workers.</p>
<p>Sawmills</p>
<p>Due to the inability to purchase timber in Wenzhou and other ports in eastern Zhejiang, coupled with the high cost of imported timber, the bleak prospects for their business are not difficult to imagine. Flour mills can maintain production because of the current sufficient wheat reserves. Seasoning powder factories are doing well because their products are sold overseas. There are currently 46 silk reeling factories in the city. They started work once before the cocoon season, but many have no intention of resuming operations. Fresh cocoons are scarce and expensive. Those who beat reeling silk to supply local demand suffer more losses, but those who are equipped with new silk reeling equipment and whose raw silk is sold on foreign markets have a better grasp of their business. Last month, the Industry Department sent personnel to conduct preliminary inspections of a total of 58 factories, most of which are located in the eastern district.</p>
<p>Collective Training</p>
<p>The seventh boiler operator training class for factories in the northern district ended on July 14th. Sixty-four students passed the examination and were given certificates. On the 12th of last month, the Shanghai Water and Electricity Company demonstrated the proper use of the "Bunsen" lamp to ten owners of small light bulb factories. On the 14th of the same month, the owners of thermos factories also held a meeting, during which the Industry Department taught them the use of spray paint. On the 26th of the same month, the Industry Department convened 14 boiler factory owners and informed them of the registration procedures that should be handled.</p>
<p>Steam Machines</p>
<p>A total of 48 boilers were registered for registration and numbering. A total of 29 installation verification certificates were issued. Last month, experts certified and supervised a total of 107 steam machines. One inspector had stamped the official numbers compiled by the Industry Department on 125 boilers in the past two months. This procedure allows all owners of the boilers to understand the importance of maintaining their boilers. One boiler installed in a certain factory was certified by two engineers as dangerous, and the Public Works Department prohibited its use, causing the factory to temporarily shut down. Last month, two boiler manufacturing factories applied for registration, and six factories were approved for registration.</p>
<p>Accidents</p>
<p>A total of 170 occupational and industrial accidents were reported last month, including 12 fatal accidents, one female death, and 12 injuries. The causes of 146 accidents have been confirmed, and 51 accidents have been investigated in detail. According to the classification of causes, accidents caused by electrical machinery were the most common, with 42 cases, including 4 fatalities. Nine workers were injured and four died from electricity. Eight workers were injured and four died from molten, hot, or corrosive substances. According to the classification of industries, the most accidents occurred in the textile industry. There were 18 fires in factories, fortunately with no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>Labor Disputes</p>
<p>The Industry Department paid attention to six labor disputes, one each in the printing and battery industries. They were resolved without the mediation of the Industry Department. A rubber factory announced its closure, and its 270 workers wrote to the Public Works Department for relief. The factory then agreed to pay funds to the Refugee Relief Association for the association to house and provide for the workers and their families. Another dispute occurred in a cigarette factory, where the factory dismissed 100 female workers, causing a dispute. As a result, the factory paid severance pay. The Industry Department plans to send these workers to work in yarn factories after receiving preliminary training. Bookbinding workers and flour mill porters went on strike once each, demanding increased wages.</p>
<p>Worker Treatment</p>
<p>Several yarn factories, seeing the difficulties in the lives of workers, have increased their wages. Several factories located in the western district determine the amount of wage increase based on the rise and fall of rice prices. Several factories also issue fixed amounts of subsidies.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index</p>
<p>The cost of living index for July increased again, nearly doubling compared to 1936, or 193 points. Comparing the various indices for June and July, the food category increased by 9.56%, the rent category increased by 4.67%, the fuel category increased by 5.58%, and the miscellaneous category increased by 0.46%. However, the clothing category decreased slightly.</p>

<h3>Compulsory Sale of Rice Imminent, Sufficient Flour Reserves, Rice Merchants Request Measures to Transport Anhui Rice, Authorities Increase Secret Agents to Investigate the Rice Market</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's investigation results, the city has sufficient flour reserves, totaling more than 3,910,000 bags. The current daily sales volume is 8,000 bags. Based on this calculation, the total reserves are sufficient for more than 16 months. This shows that the city's food supply is not at risk of shortage.</p>
<p>Black Market Transactions</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions strictly enforced price limits and punished rice merchants who raised prices, the market situation was stable for a time. It is feared that general speculative hoarders and unscrupulous merchants, disregarding the people's food, are actually doing a lot of black market transactions. Because the market is closely monitored by police detectives, fearing that secrets will be leaked, they only negotiate the quantity of transactions, and the price is directly agreed upon by the buyer and seller, without going through the market. According to reports from Daguan News Agency, the market price made in the black market in recent days has reached more than 23 yuan at the highest. Yesterday, it rose again by four or five cents. Other guest husks, such as those on various roads, were originally priced at a maximum of 16 yuan, but now they have exceeded between 18 yuan and 19 yuan. This situation is clearly manipulated, and it is hoped that the authorities will decisively deal with it to maintain the food supply for the five million people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Increase Secret Agents to Investigate Openly and Secretly</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Gong Department of the French Concession have recently increased the number of detectives disguised as merchants to infiltrate the market, and patrol around the trading platforms of more than 100 rice shops to investigate openly and secretly. If transactions exceeding the limit are discovered, they will be investigated. It is heard that once a price-gouging rice merchant is arrested, in addition to revoking the business license, the masterminds of both the buyer and seller will be severely punished according to the law, without leniency.</p>
<p>Compulsory Sale at Fair Prices, Rewards for Reporting</p>
<p>The Daguan News Agency learned that, in order to thoroughly understand the total amount of rice stored in various warehouses in Shanghai and the names of the owners, the authorities issued a notice last week, ordering the warehouses to fill in the quantity of rice stored in detail for verification. The procedure for investigating rice storage has been completed, and will be actively implemented in accordance with the methods decided upon in the consultation. When necessary, the owners will be notified to sell at a compulsory fair price. On the one hand, citizens will be encouraged to report private hoarding of rice and transactions exceeding the limit. On the other hand, another announcement will be issued in the next day or two, advising rice merchants not to raise rice prices in order to maintain the food supply. According to reports, rice industry groups have requested the Public Works Department to find ways to transport Anhui rice to Shanghai for relief, due to the scarcity of rice arriving in Shanghai and the thinning of reserves.</p>
<h3>Japanese Conspiracy to Pay Taxes with Counterfeit Money, But Legal Tender Cannot Be Destroyed, It is also Impossible to Obtain Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, a financial expert in this city stated yesterday (2nd) when meeting with a reporter that the Japanese plan to completely eliminate the circulation of legal tender in the Shanghai area and gradually replace it with "Hua Xing" currency is the starting point for Japan's struggle to win financial hegemony here. The announcement on Sunday that six major Japanese banks in this city would exchange "Hua Xing" currency at an official rate of six pence is the latest step in the Japanese plan to squeeze legal tender out of the market. It was previously rumored that Japanese commercial firms here would issue this counterfeit currency to employees in the future, and it was recently announced that rents, taxes, and officials in the Japanese-controlled areas of the city would be paid in "Hua Xing" currency, which further confirms that the Japanese have begun their deep-seated plan to undermine legal tender. Furthermore, the amount of "Hua Xing" currency in circulation was close to one million yuan on July 16th, and on July 31st, the bank announced that it had reached 1.4 million yuan. As far as the Japanese government is concerned, the current policy of the Japanese army seems to be unilateral. Shortly after the devaluation of legal tender on July 14th, it was heard that the Japanese Asia Development Board, which controls "Hua Xing Bank," and the Japanese Ministry of Finance had a conflict over the future of the counterfeit bank. The Ministry of Finance wanted to use "Hong Kou currency" only as a</p>
<p>Way to Obtain Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Stating that although the exchange rate of legal tender has fallen, it is still used as "internal currency" and is widely used. The Asia Development Board opposes this, advocating the forced circulation of "Hua Xing" currency and immediately severing all relations with legal tender. However, both sides agreed to fix the price of "Hua Xing" currency at six pence, making the counterfeit currency another step in dominating power here. In some aspects, Japanese people advocate the forced use of "Hua Xing" currency to pay all customs duties, but Tokyo has already added its recognition to this. Regarding the possibility that the Japanese army will imitate Tianjin and block Shanghai when it is no longer possible, yesterday</p>
<p>Opinions Diverged</p>
<p>Some pointed out that the harsh methods of the Japanese army in North China are not enough to drive legal tender out of the foreign concessions, but this decision includes the recognition of "the needs of the Japanese in occupied areas arising from special circumstances" in the Anglo-Japanese compromise, and its power may be applied to the situation in this city. The Yokohama Specie Bank replied to an inquiry from a foreign bank in this city yesterday as to whether it would purchase "Hua Xing" currency at the prescribed price, stating that it was unaware of the matter.</p>
<h3>The Lower Yangtze River Shipping Business is Not Easy, Foreign Ships Continue to Navigate, Sacrifices are Inevitable</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War, the Yangtze River has been blockaded at Jiangyin, the navigation route has been cut off, shipping has been suspended, Chinese merchants have stopped operating, and foreign merchants have switched to the lower reaches, namely Xin Port, Xinsheng Port, Zhang Huang Port, and Dongjie Port in Jingjiang County, Tiansheng Port and Yao Port in Nantong County, and the ports of Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, etc. In</p>
<p>The Past Six Months</p>
<p>Shipping on this route has been unusually prosperous, and northern Jiangsu has relied on it to open up. Therefore, at the peak of this period, there were as many as twenty or thirty ships sailing to the above-mentioned ports. However, the organizations of these companies were mostly outsiders. At that time, because inland goods were concentrated in the above-mentioned ports, customers only sought to ship the goods out and did not care about the freight, so business was very easy and profitable. From this year</p>
<p>June 1st</p>
<p>The Japanese army, citing military times, restricted navigation and obstructed foreign ships, and the shipping industry gradually declined. The ships sailing to Xin Port, Xinsheng Port, Zhang Huang Port, and Dongjie Port have successively suspended navigation, and Japanese merchants have added ships to navigate. Although British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire sent Tong He and Wu Lin ships to maintain navigation rights, there were no goods to and from, and passengers were only departing from Shanghai, slightly more than dozens or hundreds. Those returning to Shanghai from Xin Port, etc.</p>
<p>There Was Not A Single Person</p>
<p>The two companies continued to navigate at the cost of sacrifices, but the schedule was sometimes slightly extended. Tong He ship returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It was originally scheduled to export this morning, but due to boiler repairs, it has now been changed to next Tuesday (8th) morning to New Port. Butterfield &amp; Swire Wu Lin ship can arrive this afternoon, and will continue to New Port at 6 am tomorrow. German merchants also have only a few ships such as Ke Si Deng, Hai Kang, and Lu An, etc. The cargo transportation is very bleak, and there are slightly more passengers than British ships. It is heard that</p>
<p>The Japanese Ship Business</p>
<p>Is Also Very Average. The biggest reason for this is that the inland guerrillas do not allow the export of goods, and the Japanese cannot do anything about it. The Chongming route is completely occupied by Japanese merchants, and only the Nissin Company dispatches Zhejiang and Qing Ning ships to sail alone. These two ships were converted from the ferries of the former city ferry. The Haimen-Qidong line has fewer Japanese ships sailing, and the cargo transportation is slightly better. Because there are more ships, if you want to make a profit,</p>
<p>It May Be Very Difficult</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Yi He ship has been sailing on the Qi Hai route for a long time. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday, but it is heard that there are still goods waiting to be loaded in the northern sand area, so it has been changed to return to Shanghai today, and will continue to Qinglong and Sanhe Port tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sealing Off of the North Jiangxi Road Seems to Be Temporary, The Epidemic Prevention Office Removed and Stopped Issuing Passes, But the Future Situation is Still Quite Speculative</h3>
<p>The stores, residents, and alleyways on the North Jiangxi Road, which runs from the north end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south to the east end of the Old Bazhi Road in the north, have been suddenly blocked by the Japanese army with wooden poles and barbed wire since the 29th of last month. Although the Japanese soldiers' sentry post at the blocked gap has been removed, the relocation situation has not ended. The open-air epidemic prevention office set up by the Japanese on the eastern section of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road has been removed since yesterday and no longer injects residents living in the newly blocked area with epidemic prevention injections. The passes exchanged for epidemic prevention certificates have also been suspended. It is heard that the passes issued by the Japanese to the residents of the area a few days ago are only valid for two months, which is clearly temporary and different from the long-term passes issued to the residents of Hongkou. Therefore, whether the sealing off of the area is temporary or of the same nature as the Hongkou area is quite speculative.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Management of Ship Traffic at Zhenhai Estuary; Adapting to the Zhenhai Blockade; Reporting Customs Required for Entry and Exit Between Ningbo and Zhenhai</h3>
<p>Special Announcement from the Zhejiang Customs Tax Office: This Customs Office is now implementing temporary regulations to adapt to the special circumstances of the Zhenhai Estuary blockade and to strengthen customs management of steamships, tugboats, and gasoline-powered vessels. The regulations are as follows: (1) Passenger steamships and other vessels traveling in the Fenghua River and Yuyao River area shall continue to report entry at the Jiangdong Tax Collection Office of this Customs Office, as per usual practice, and complete customs clearance procedures upon departure. (2) Steamships and other vessels traveling between Ningbo and Zhenhai shall, until further notice, complete import and export customs declaration procedures at the Jiangdong Tax Collection Office if traveling between 5:00 PM and 7:00 AM the next morning. If traveling between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM, they shall complete import and export customs declaration procedures at the customs wharf. (3) When passing the customs wharf between Ningbo and Zhenhai, all steamships and other vessels must stop, regardless of whether they are entering or leaving, and proceed only after completing customs declaration procedures. (4) Steamships and other vessels towing vessels to transport goods from ships outside the Zhenhai Estuary need not complete import and export procedures at the Zhenhai Branch Station. However, these procedures must be completed with the customs officer stationed on the ship. The above measures shall be implemented from today. This announcement is hereby issued for all shipping merchants to take note of.</p>
<h3>In Addition to Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, Banknotes from All Other Regions are Valid; Holders Can Exchange for Shanghai Currency at Banks; All Businesses Should Accept Them Without Doubt</h3>
<p>To prevent speculators from taking advantage and to encourage the flow of funds into the interior, the China &amp;amp; Communications Banks have stipulated regulations for the exchange of banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, which have been well-received and supported by banknote holders. However, some people in the market, unaware of the true situation, have refused to accept banknotes from regions other than Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, as well as subsidiary currency notes from Jiangsu Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with banking circles again yesterday and learned that banknotes from all banks (including commercial banks) other than those in Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou are fully valid and should no longer be refused. All banknote holders can exchange them for Shanghai-denominated banknotes at designated banks. Subsidiary currency notes issued by Jiangsu Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank are also fully valid, as these subsidiary currency notes were issued with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, the subsidiary currency notes of the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Money Bureau are circulated in the same way as those of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank. However, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has been trying to recall these subsidiary currency notes, and the number circulating in the market is small. All banknote holders can exchange them at the Jiangsu Farmers Bank.</p>
<h3>A Raging Fire in Datuan Town, Pudong; Burning for Sixteen Hours; Traitorous Police in Tuolin Revolt</h3>
<p>Previous reports have detailed the demolition and subsequent burning of houses in Datuan Town by the Japanese army. According to sources who arrived in Shanghai from Pudong yesterday, the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army has been besieging the Japanese army in Datuan, Xinchang, Huicheng, Zhoupu, and other places for three days and nights. The Japanese army is unable to move except to defend their fortifications. When the Loyal Righteous Army first decided to besiege the area, the merchants and residents of Datuan competed to donate food and other items. Enraged, the Japanese army set a large fire on the morning of the 29th. The entire town of Datuan burned from 3:00 AM to around 7:00 AM, with flames soaring high. The people evacuated, leaving the famous and wealthy town of Pudong in ruins. While the Loyal Righteous Army was attacking the Japanese army in various places, a unit under Gu Shouxin secretly attacked Tuolin. The traitorous police chief Liu and his men, numbering over forty, seized the opportunity to revolt, taking with them one machine gun, twenty-eight rifles, and three Mauser pistols. A Japanese instructor named Ogawa and a traitorous police inspector were killed, and two pistols were captured. Liu's unit has now been incorporated into Gu's unit to serve the country.</p>
<h3>White Russian Anti-Communist Association Takes Action; Active in the Hongkou Area; Actions Highly Secretive</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports: "The 'Shanghai White Russian Anti-Communist Association,' following the actions of similar groups established after the Japanese army's occupation of Shandong and North China, officially declared its existence yesterday (the 2nd). Members were sent to the homes of White Russian immigrants residing in the Hongkou, Huishan, and Yangshupu areas to distribute what the group calls a 'Questionnaire.'" All White Russian immigrants over the age of eighteen must answer fifteen questions and attach a photograph. The questionnaire bears the name "Shanghai White Russian Anti-Communist Association" but does not state the address of the group's headquarters or other branches. Those who visited White Russian immigrants only told them that they needed to fill out the form and that it would be collected later. In addition to the usual questions found on general application forms, such as name, age, and place of birth, the anti-communist questionnaire also asks for details of the person's stay in China, past and present political affiliations, and a complete military service record. The name of the head of the new organization, the Shanghai White Russian Anti-Communist Association, is not mentioned on the form.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit over Eviction from the Metropolitan; Hengye Company Loses; Having Increased the Rent, They Suddenly Demanded Eviction; Appeal Against Land Rights Dismissed</h3>
<p>The land where the Metropolitan Garden Ballroom at 56 Gordon Road is located was originally leased from Puyi Real Estate Company for 700 yuan per month, with no fixed term. After the lease, the Metropolitan invested more than 100,000 yuan to build the ballroom and arrange the garden. Three years after the lease, in April of last year, the land was transferred from Puyi Company to the British-owned Hengye Real Estate Company for management.</p>
<p>After Hengye took over the management,</p>
<p>they notified the Metropolitan on the first of this month that the rent would be increased to 850 yuan per month from January 1 of this year. The Metropolitan, fearing the risk of being subjected to rent increases, negotiated with Hengye for a fixed-term contract of three years. Just as the negotiations were about to conclude, Hengye suddenly announced the termination of negotiations and further notified the Metropolitan that it must demolish the buildings on the leased land, restore it to its original state, and terminate the lease from April 5 of this year. In addition to complying with the rent increase</p>
<p>and paying the rent,</p>
<p>the Metropolitan expressed disagreement with the termination of the lease. Hengye then filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against the Metropolitan Ballroom for the termination of the lease. Jiang Yaozhang, the manager of the Metropolitan, appointed lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend, arguing that since the plaintiff had notified the rent increase first and the defendant had complied, the plaintiff now suddenly demanding the demolition of the buildings and restoration to the original state showed that there was another purpose. Although the contract signed by the nominal parties appeared to be a lease, what the defendant actually leased was an empty piece of land, and the Metropolitan invested in building the</p>
<p>building on the land.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was actually a land rights relationship under civil law. According to the regulations on land rights, the contract can only be terminated if the rent is in arrears for more than two years. The Metropolitan does not owe any rent at all, so how can the contract be terminated? Therefore, the court was requested to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. After the trial, the court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. Hengye, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. However, during the appeal process, the Metropolitan obtained an important piece of evidence: a letter from Hengye Company to Dai Zuwen, a former shareholder of the Metropolitan (who had withdrawn his shares),</p>
<p>demanding payment of land rent</p>
<p>of 1,600 yuan, which was for the land where the Metropolitan is now located. The letter stated that the land rent was based on the contract signed on January 24 of this year. This shows that Hengye's lawsuit was based on</p>
<p>Hengye's plan to gain several hundred yuan per month in rent</p>
<p>and sacrificing the interests of others. Therefore, at the hearing of the appeal, lawyer Chen Tingrui presented this evidence to prove that the appellant's purpose in the litigation was contrary to the principles of good faith and credit in transactions. Hengye Company's actions</p>
<p>were obviously inappropriate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed, and the appellant should bear the costs of the second-instance litigation. The case has been heard by the Second Branch of the High Court and a judgment has been announced, dismissing Hengye Company's appeal and ordering the appellant to bear the costs of the litigation.</p>
<h3>A Three-Year-Old Child Scalded to Death by Boiling Water</h3>
<p>Yuan Huichuan, a 32-year-old Shaoxing native residing at 671 Rue Massenet in the French Concession, is a merchant dealing in foreign goods. He has a three-year-old son named Shunfa. One day at 3:00 PM, Yuan's wife, feeling hot and stuffy, took a kettle out to fetch hot water and poured it into a bathtub, intending to give the child a bath. Unexpectedly, her son Shunfa, being young and unaware, approached the water and tripped, falling into the hot water. He was scalded on his abdomen and other areas. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but due to the toxins attacking his heart, treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd.</p>

<h3>The Owner of the Yilun Factory in Wuxi Was Abducted and Murdered; Two Robbers Arrested in Shanghai; The Deceased's Wife Ran into Them in Shanghai and They Were Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>Xue Ashun, a 36-year-old man from Wuxi, operated a small silk factory called Yilun in his hometown of Butterfly Village and had accumulated some savings. On May 4 of last year, his home was invaded by more than ten robbers, who stole 780 yuan in cash. Then, on March 25 of this year, the local tyrant Hou Genxiang and his gang kidnapped Xue Ashun and demanded a ransom of 1,900 yuan. Xue's wife, Dai, went to negotiate with Hou, but when they could not agree on a price, Hou detained her and shot her in the head twice, causing injuries. He then shot Xue Ashun, killing him. The ruthlessness of the act was unprecedented. After being detained, Dai was guarded by an old bandit. The bandit, seeing her dire situation, secretly released her. Dai, terrified, fled to Shanghai to work and make a living. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, while walking past the Liangxi Hotel at 144 Hubei Road, she suddenly saw Hou Genxiang enter.</p>
<p>Upon seeing her enemy, her eyes turned red. She followed him in and learned that Hou was staying in room 20 of the hotel. She asked the hotel staff for assistance, and the hotel reported the matter to the Lao Zha Police Station by telephone. Chief Detective You Agen led detectives Wang Jiaju and Qin Boliang to the scene. By then, Hou had gone to the Aiyou Barber Shop next door at 118 for a haircut. He was taken back to the police station.</p>
<p>According to Hou's defense during interrogation, he was a member of the Self-Defense Corps supported by the Japanese in Wuxi. He reported Xue to the Japanese army as a bandit, and the Japanese army arrested and executed him. As for Xue's wife, Dai, he admitted to punching her in the head, but he denied shooting her. However, the detectives observed that the scars on Dai's head were clearly from a gunshot wound, not from punches. Hou and his accomplice, Pan, were then detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao presented the case and requested temporary detention for investigation. The crime took place in Wuxi, but after the prosecution, he would request the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate jurisdiction. Judge Pan Shide approved the request and ordered Hou and Pan to be strictly detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Apprentices Squandered Funds; Chen Guanlun's Bad Behavior; Chen Chunzhi Was Greatly Deceived</h3>
<p>Chen Chunzhi, an apprentice at the Hesheng Pawnshop at 235 North Henan Road, was a Chaozhou native and had familial ties to the owner, Chen Songyan. He was well-trusted. Although only nineteen years old, he was responsible for managing money. Chen Guanlun, a Jiangyin native and employee of a cigarette paper shop at 247 next door, became acquainted with Chunzhi, and they became very close over time. Recently, Guanlun was dismissed by his employer. He then used deceptive words to</p>
<p>induce Chunzhi to embezzle 500 yuan to go to the interior to do business together. Once they made a great profit, they would no longer have to depend on others. Chunzhi, deceived by his words, stole 550 yuan in banknotes from the pawnshop on the first of last month, abandoned his job, and fled with Guanlun to Caojiadu Town in western Shanghai. They squandered the money at an inn. After about a week, Guanlun took advantage of Chunzhi's absence and stole 200 yuan and a gold ring and silk pants from his suitcase and fled. Since then, Chunzhi lived alone in that place. By the 18th of last month, the money had been spent, and the innkeeper ordered him to leave. With nowhere to go, he returned to the pawnshop</p>
<p>and confessed his previous mistakes to his master, Chen Songyan. Chen then tolerated his behavior without exposing it and continued to employ him while secretly investigating Chen Guanlun's whereabouts. The day before yesterday morning, he saw Guanlun return to the cigarette paper shop and immediately reported it to the Public Concession Police Station. The police chief sent detective Cao Jinbiao to the scene, who arrested Guanlun and brought him and Chunzhi to the police station for interrogation. Both Chen confessed without reservation, but the stolen money had been spent and nothing remained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First District Local Court for investigation. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, and Chen Songyan recounted the events. Judge Zhan then interrogated the two defendants. According to Chen Chunzhi's confession, it was Chen Guanlun who started the idea, so Guanlun used or stole all the stolen money, a total of 320 yuan. The remaining money was spent on food and lodging. Chen Guanlun only confessed that the 200 yuan in the suitcase was taken by him privately, that the remaining money was spent together, and denied starting the idea. After the court hearing, both defendants were ordered to be detained for sentencing next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Schemes Emerge One After Another; Itinerant Magicians Are Rampant; A Foolish Salesman Is Deceived and Fired; An Abominable Magician Cannot Escape the Law</h3>
<p>Xu Yushu, the manager of the Yishenghang Wool Shop at 64 Rue Vouille in the French Concession, sent Wei Kuisheng, a salesman from the shop (21 years old, from Shaoxing, promoted from apprentice to salesman), to Taiping Bridge, Ximen Road on the morning of the 14th of last month to collect debts. Unexpectedly, Wei collected 1,000 yuan and met an itinerant magician while walking past Nanyang Bridge. The magician told Wei that he had good fortune and that he could help him with magic, turning ten yuan into much more money in an instant. Wei was young and inexperienced, and greed blinded him. He went with the itinerant magician to a nearby hotel in Nanyang and opened a room. The magician ordered Wei to hand over the 1,000 yuan and put it into a small blue cloth bag, telling Wei to pinch the cloth bag, close his eyes tightly, and wait for the god of wealth to descend. After three hours, he could turn it into 10,000 yuan. Wei believed it was true and pinched the cloth bag tightly with both hands, closing his eyes tightly. The magician stood by his side chanting scriptures. From 12:00 noon to 3:00 PM, Wei heard the magician stop chanting. He opened his eyes and looked at the cloth bag, and the 1,000 yuan in banknotes had turned into waste paper. He tried to find the magician, but he was nowhere to be found. Wei became anxious and reported to the police station, saying that he had encountered a thief between Baxianqiao and Songshan Road who stole 1,000 yuan in banknotes. After investigation by the detectives, the whole story became clear. Wei was detained and sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution. After the trial, Wei was sentenced to 15 days of detention for falsely reporting theft, with a two-year suspended sentence. Xu Yushu, the manager of Yishenghang, had already reconciled with Wei and did not pursue the matter further, only suspending Wei to show a warning. After his job was broken, Wei ran around looking for work for days. The day before yesterday, while walking past the Dadong Tea Room on Nanjing Road, he ran into Yang Dongsheng (28 years old, from Suzhou), the itinerant magician who had previously swindled him out of banknotes. He then shouted for the police and dragged Yang to the Lao Zha Police Station. After questioning, it was learned that the incident occurred in the French Concession, so it was transferred to the French Police Station for investigation. According to Yang's confession, he also had accomplices Zhou Rongfei (24 years old, from Ningbo) and a Yuan, who lived at 5 Ziyang Lane, Lalingde Road. The police chief sent detective Kang Hui to the address and arrested only Zhou Rongfei. Yuan had escaped, and a suitcase containing tools used for magic and conjuring was found under the bed. They were taken back to the police station together. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer requested detention for investigation and to arrest the accomplices at large. After Judge Huang Yan interrogated the defendants, he approved the request to detain the defendants for further investigation on another date.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Chen Chang Arrested for Fraud</h3>
<p>Chen Hailun (also known as Chen Chang), an overseas Chinese residing in Hong Kong, came to Shanghai from Hong Kong in June and purchased typewriters, radios, and other items from Huang Weirao, an employee of the American-owned Shenchang Foreign Firm. Huang was deceived, and the total price of the goods, 2,030 yuan in legal currency, was never paid. Chen Chang then disappeared. It was not until the day before yesterday that he was arrested by detective Guan Huchen of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. He was sent to the First District Local Court yesterday, where he was brought before Judge Zhan for interrogation. After police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, the court questioned the plaintiff and defendant separately and ordered the defendant to be detained for further hearing next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Residents of Renjili, Ximen Road Oppose a 30% Rent Increase; Representatives Negotiate</h3>
<p>Amidst the rising prices of all goods, the landlord of Renjili, Ximen Road, China Construction Real Estate Company, recently notified tenants that rents would be increased by 30% across the board from September 1 (i.e., next month). There are about 70 shops and residences in the lane. After the "August 13th" incident, rents had already been increased by 10%, and tenants were also responsible for water bills. The tenants felt that the landlord's latest notice of a 30% rent increase was too much of a burden. They have now elected a Mr. Zhang as their representative and decided to negotiate with the landlord to withdraw the rent increase.</p>
<h3>High Tide and Rapid Current Yesterday Morning; Water Level Rose Again and Receded Only at Dawn</h3>
<p>The high tide of the Huangpu River continued to rise yesterday morning. The Bund shoreline was getting closer to the water level. The tide occurred at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning and receded only at dawn. The current reached a speed of 1.8 nautical miles per hour during high tide, which was very rapid. There will be another high tide tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Concubine Accuses First Wife of Theft</h3>
<p>Dai Shoufan, a 62-year-old Fujian native and traditional Chinese doctor, has a small fortune and owns one wife and two concubines. His wife, Qiu (61 years old, Fujian native), lives at 21 Lane 280, Rue Sapey. His concubine, Zhou (46 years old, Fujian native), lives at 5 Leshi Lane, Leshi Road. His second concubine, Li (43 years old, Beijing native), lives at 12 Tingyun Lane, Avenue Lafayette. On the 12th of last month, Dai died of illness at Li's residence. A sutra was recited for Dai at Li's residence the day before yesterday. Li suddenly reported to the French Concession Police Station, accusing Dai's first wife, Qiu, and his concubine, Zhou, of taking the opportunity to steal suitcases and other items. The French Police Station ordered detectives to arrest Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou and sent them to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special District Court yesterday, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Huang interrogated them briefly. The defendant Dai Qiu and others appointed lawyer Ge Zhitan to appear in court, stating that the case concerned family affairs and that there was no theft. After reviewing the statement, the court approved Dai Qiu's release on a 300-yuan shop guarantee and temporarily detained Dai Zhou for further hearing on August 10.</p>
<h3>Traitorous Police Pursue Refugees, Causing a Serious Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 PM, several refugees left the refugee camp on Hongqiao Road. The traitorous police of Jiaotong University found out and rushed to chase them back to the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Haig Road. The French police at the intersection stopped them and did not allow them to cross the border. Dozens of traitorous police officers chased after them, and misunderstandings arose, leading to arguments. After the French police learned of the situation, they sent a large number of Chinese, Western, and Russian officers to maintain order, and the traffic was temporarily blocked. The situation was serious, but fortunately, no incident occurred. The police then withdrew.</p>
<h3>Residents of Haigeri Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<p>The tenants of Haigeri Road, Xujiahui, have recently received a letter from the property management office of Ma Dunhou Tang, the landlord of Haigeri, stating that the municipal council is increasing the land tax year by year and repair costs have also increased due to high prices. Therefore, the rent must be increased slightly to compensate. From August 1, each building will increase by four yuan. All tenants oppose the increase and demand that the decision be withdrawn and the increase postponed.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Bao Ruichen, manager of Tianyuanxiang Firm, who informed me that he read a news item in the "Local News" section of Shenbao Newspaper yesterday titled "Thugs Smashed Showcase," which stated, "Last month, the firm was reorganized, and the bookkeeper, Mr. Lu, was publicly elected as manager. Bao was very dissatisfied and lingered, refusing to hand over the job, leading to disputes between the old and new factions." After investigation, Ruichen has been the manager of the firm since its establishment, and there has never been a reorganization or a public election of a bookkeeper named Lu as manager. Furthermore, there is no one named Lu in the firm. This is clearly inconsistent with the facts, affects Ruichen's reputation, and may cause confusion. Please correct the matter on behalf of my client to protect my client's reputation. I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Shuxun</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Wang Shaochang, who stated that he read a news item in the news section of Shenbao Newspaper on the 3rd of this month titled "The Anti-Smoking Bureau Abuses the Issuance of Stamps," which stated that the client was implied by Mr. Zhu to help facilitate the matter. I am very surprised. I have never heard of or been involved in the soil business in Shanghai, and I do not know Mr. Zhu at all. How can I facilitate the matter? This is clearly a false rumor. The matter concerns my reputation. I would like to ask your lawyer to send a letter to Shenbao to quickly correct the matter to avoid confusion and mishearing. Accordingly, I am sending this letter to you to check and make corrections. I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyers Xue Du, Chen Tingrui, August 3</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao Newspaper,</p>
<p>The "Local News" in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month published an article titled "The Ministry of Finance Holds Domestic Exchange Control," which stated that the Chamber of Commerce used to handle the application for foreign exchange purchases for various industries, which would continue to work as usual. After investigation, this association has never handled the application for foreign exchange purchases, and this association is the Shanghai Commercial French Association. The so-called Shanghai Business Association Shanghai Office is a non-existent title. I hope you will correct it immediately.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce</p>

<h3>The Most Difficult to Treat Ringworm, the Most Famous Sweet Dew, Millions of People's Faith is an Iron Guarantee</h3>
<p>A customer asked: I use "Sweet Dew" and never feel any pain. Moreover, once applied, it can stop itching for twenty-four hours, providing coolness, comfort, moisture, and smoothness, which is incomparable to other medicines that cause stinging pain. And the speed at which the affected area recovers often exceeds expectations. What is the reason for this? I said: Ah! This is why Sweet Dew is Sweet Dew. It is the unique aspect of "Sweet Dew." The perfection of the "Sweet Dew" prescription is unmatched at the moment. The main functions of "Sweet Dew" are to kill bacteria, stop itching, remove dampness, and reduce inflammation, and it can also moisturize the skin and prevent pain. Ringworm medicine often loses its moisturizing properties, causing redness, swelling, stinging pain, cracking, and bleeding when applied to the skin. Moreover, the condition remains the same after several peels. This is because the prescription is incomplete. As for "Sweet Dew," it has absolutely no such drawbacks because it contains rich skin moisturizers and sufficient painkillers. Therefore, the value of the raw materials used is extremely high. May I ask, can cheap ringworm medicines imitate this? Sweet Dew has been the most famous remedy for ringworm, eczema, scabies, itching, rashes, and other conditions for more than ten years. It holds the Central Health Administration Drug Permit No. 363 and is one of the famous medicines produced by Shanghai Tongren Western Medicine Company. All major pharmacies and Western medicine departments of major companies nationwide sell it.</p>

<h3>Calm in Financial and Foreign Exchange Markets</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listing showed no gains or losses. The unofficial British and American exchange market was somewhat loose due to the Bank of Japan's performance and profit-taking. In addition, advantageous actions by the Bank of England (acting on behalf of Tianjin banks) and the Bank of China also contributed to short selling, resulting in a relatively loose initial underlying trend. The British pound once rose to 4 shillings and 5 pence, and the US dollar also fell to 8.75 yuan. Later, because HSBC Bank had unlimited appetite for buying British pounds at 4 shillings and 5 pence, it was hindered. Afterwards, the Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly increased its buying activity, so the market gradually softened. As a result, the price barely changed. It was heard that around 3 o'clock, both the British and American exchange rates returned to the previous day's closing price. At first, the futures for this month were dull due to foreign banks' appetite for buying, so the situation was even looser. The British pound once rose to 4 shillings and 3.75 pence, and the US dollar also briefly recovered to 8.4375 yuan. Later, because Western merchant Sassoon and China merchant seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, the situation recovered slightly. In the end, the British pound barely rose by 0.0625, and the US dollar also barely rose by 0.125. As a result, the swap spread became even narrower. According to the evening closing, the British pound difference was 0.171875, and the US dollar difference was 0.375, which roughly equals a monthly interest rate of slightly over 4.5% after deducting commissions. In reality, arbitrageurs mostly only paid an additional 0.25 US dollars, which roughly equals a monthly interest rate of only about 3% after deducting commissions. Therefore, arbitrage transactions were subdued, while other transactions were still active.</p>
<p>Heavy Selling in the Morning Market</p>
<p>In the early morning, the near and far-term rates of the London big bar (silver bullion) both decreased by 0.125. The New York silver price was stable. The London raw gold price remained unchanged. The British-to-US exchange rate was stable. The British-to-Shanghai rate increased by 0.0625. The British-to-French rate increased by 0.01 franc. The US-to-British rate did not change. The US-to-Shanghai rate increased by 0.1 yuan. The US-to-French rate remained flat. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' morning opening spot selling prices were: British pound at 4 shillings and 0.0625 pence, US dollar at 8.59375 yuan, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After the opening, selling pressure from the Japanese banking sector and advantageous British banks was heavy, and the Bank of China also did not stop selling, so the market trend gradually strengthened. It is estimated that the Japanese banks, advantageous banks, and the Bank of China successively sold spot British pounds at 4 shillings 4.375 pence and 4.6875 pence to foreign bank X (Dutch). Then, the Bank of China and the Japanese bank sold spot US dollars at 8.625 yuan and 8.6875 yuan to Andatsu Transport and Communications Dutch. Until the HSBC listing was announced, there were no changes, and the balance tax on silver was still exempted. After this, advantageous actions again sold spot British pounds at 4 shillings and 5 pence to HSBC. At the same time, the US dollar also rose to 8.75 yuan. At that time, the Bank of China also sold off this month's British pounds, from 4 shillings and 3.125 pence to 3.75 pence. At the same time, foreign banks also briefly recovered this month's US dollar to 8.4375 yuan. Near noon, the British merchant Sassoon suddenly seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, settling this month's US dollar for 8.375 yuan with a foreign bank, so the situation recovered slightly. At that time, the selling price of spot exchange by foreign banks was about 30.05 yuan, which seemed slightly firm. Extending to the noon closing, the banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence, US dollar at 8.6875 yuan, this month's British pound at 4 shillings and 2.5 pence, US dollar at 8.28125 yuan.</p>
<p>Barely Changed</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market softened again due to the sudden increase in buying activity by the Japanese bank. It is estimated that the Yokohama Specie Bank settled spot British pounds at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence and spot US dollars at 8.65625 yuan with a foreign bank. Afterwards, a Chinese merchant bought this month's US dollars at 8.25 yuan with a foreign bank. Extending to the evening closing, the banks' spot selling prices were: British pound at 4 shillings and 4.21875 pence, US dollar at 8.625 yuan (it was heard that after 3 o'clock, the British pound softened again to 4 shillings and 0.0625 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 8.59375 yuan), this month's British pound at 4 shillings and 2.5 pence, US dollar at 8.25 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound was slightly firmer by 0.015625 and the US dollar was slightly looser by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. This month's British pound was cheaper by 0.0625, and the US dollar was firmer by 0.25.</p>
<p>Stable Hong Kong Exchange Market</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 3rd. Today's exchange market opened mixed. The British and American exchange rates were unchanged. The Chinese exchange rate decreased by 3 yuan to 317 yuan. Until the later closing, there were no gains or losses.</p>
<p>Stable Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Tianjin, 3rd. Today's exchange market opened weak. The rate against the US dollar loosened by 0.375 to 3 pence and 0.875 yuan. The rate against the US dollar increased by 0.5 yuan to 7.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate was stable, remaining at 110 yuan. The unofficial price of "Joint Currency" was cheaper by 1.5 yuan, at 103 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Prices Fluctuated Before Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial cash market trend was erratic, generally falling sharply first and then rising sharply, ultimately showing no gains or losses, entirely dependent on the tightness or looseness of foreign exchange and shifts in buying and selling pressure. At the initial opening, due to the firmness of foreign exchange and the eagerness of securities firms to sell, coupled with hesitant buyers, there was a lack of support, and the price briefly fell to a low of 3,530 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange stopped loosening and recovered slightly, buying interest arose, and general scalpers rushed to absorb, so the price recovered to 3,585 yuan. At noon, as those who had profited that day cashed out at high prices, the price fell again, hovering around the 3,550 yuan mark. Afterwards, as foreign exchange returned to stability, buying interest revived, and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of a South China group, absorbed quite a bit. In addition, speculators who had sold off returned to buy, and the market strengthened suddenly. By the evening closing, the price had recovered to as high as 3,600 yuan. The total volume of transactions throughout the day was small, about 700 to 800 taels. The price of jewelry gold in silver shops also initially fell and then recovered to flat. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable as before.</p>
<p>No Change in Raw Gold</p>
<p>Since the early morning opening of the first bar (10 taels), due to the firmness of foreign exchange and increased anxiety, buyers were cautious. At the opening, the price was sharply lowered by 40 yuan. A certain gold shop sold 10 taels to silver shop firms at 3,560 yuan. After the opening, securities firms vigorously sold off dozens of taels. Due to a lack of buyers, the price continued to weaken. At one point, the price even plummeted by 30 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to silver shop firms at 3,530 yuan, the lowest price of the day. At that time, a certain cash shop and a certain gold shop (acting on behalf of speculators) seized the opportunity to absorb at low prices, recovering the price by 30 yuan. A certain cash shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange business at 3,560 yuan. After this, as foreign exchange stopped loosening and recovered slightly, and securities firms also came to absorb, the price rose again by 25 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 10 taels from a money exchange business at 3,585 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop (acting on behalf of speculators) suddenly stopped buying, cashed out profits, and the money exchange business also came to sell off, so the market picture weakened again, falling by 35 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to a money exchange business, priced at 3,550 yuan. At noon, securities firms again sold 20 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,552 yuan as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, the market was still flat. First, a cash shop sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at 3,550 yuan. Then, securities firms sold 10 taels to a certain silver shop at 3,550 yuan. After this, a dramatic rising trend suddenly occurred, because the foreign exchange situation softened, and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of a South China group, vigorously absorbed non-stop. In addition, the Jia Yi Gold Shop, acting on behalf of speculators, and securities firms also resumed buying interest, soaring by 55 yuan. Silver shop firms sold 50 taels to gold shops at 3,600 yuan as the evening closing price. It was heard that after the closing, there were buyers but no sellers at 3,605 yuan. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous day. The price difference throughout the day was 70 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' standard gold was 10 yuan higher based on raw gold prices. The current bidding gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were few open transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Initially Fell Slightly Before Recovering</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops: Initially, the Da Tong Hang still quoted 365 yuan. At 9:37, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. At 2:45 PM, the price recovered by 5 yuan. As a result, there was no change. The Da Tong Hang still quoted 365 yuan. The Xin Tong Hang quoted 363 yuan. The buying and selling prices were generally higher or lower by several yuan to ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for British and American Gold Tickets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, were in short supply, and the market was stable. Demand for gold tickets was very strong, and prices also rose. Hong Kong tickets were in short supply, and market prices rose slightly. Canadian and Philippine silver tickets were in strong demand, and inventories were scarce. Moreover, US dollar tickets were strong, following the uptrend. Japanese gold tickets resumed their downward trend, with the evening price at 1.05 yuan. Korean tickets were priced at 0.878 yuan in the evening market. Public Association transactions were very active. Rentai sold 1,500 yuan of Hong Kong tickets to Xiang Kang, and also sold 200 yuan of US dollar tickets to Qin Tai. Changtai also sold 200 yuan of US dollar tickets to Jin Tai. Yongfeng sold 200 yuan of US dollar tickets to Jin Da, and also sold 300 yuan of US dollar tickets to Qin Tai. Mao Feng sold 300 yuan of US dollar tickets to Chang Tai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold tickets rose by 0.3 yuan, US dollar tickets rose by 0.15 yuan, Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.01 yuan, Canadian tickets rose by 0.4 yuan, Philippine tickets rose by 0.3 yuan. The prices of other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Exchange and Discount Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange and discount rates for bills of exchange recovered and fell again. The rate initially broke through 200 yuan per thousand, hovering around 190 yuan. It then became unsustainable, falling to 175 yuan. At noon, it recovered again to 190 yuan. The afternoon trend was flat, eventually retreating slightly to 185 yuan, falling by 25 yuan compared to the previous day's final price. The interest rates of the Money Exchange Association remained unchanged, quoted at 0.2 yuan for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Temporary Respite in the Rising Trend of Securities and Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market situation was high and then low. After rising for five consecutive days, the trend finally seemed to ease slightly. In terms of buying and selling, buyers initially continued to absorb, with Da Feng buying the most of Class A shares. Yi Zhong and Song Mao also had strong appetites. Class C shares were raised to 44 yuan, and Da Feng then sold off Class C shares. Issues No. 20, 35, and 64 were supplied extremely heavily. The prices of Class B and C shares plummeted by almost 1 yuan. At that time, there were very few buyers. Retail investors made slight compensations, while Fu Chun continued to sell off. There was no excitement at the closing, and the trend was likely to change. The market prices ultimately showed slight improvements of 0.2 to 0.4 yuan, except for Class B shares, which improved slightly by 0.015 yuan. The total volume of transactions was estimated to be about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below (London foreign debt market prices unchanged).</p>
<p>40 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded, priced at 8.35 yuan.</p>
<p>London British Far East Company Stock Market Prices on the 2nd of this month (Wednesday): HSBC Bank, London-registered shares fell by 0.5 pound, priced at 74 pounds; Hong Kong-registered shares rose by 0.5 pound, priced at 77 pounds; the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Yarn Falls, Speculative Buying Subsides</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the yarn market has subsided. Because the foundation of foreign exchange has become increasingly stable, speculative buying in the market has gradually subsided. However, the mindset of hoarders is still strong. If prices fall, they will still come to absorb and accumulate. As for actual demand, Chinese fabric buyers continue to purchase relentlessly. Given the current situation, unless there are unexpected changes, the yarn market may linger for a while. However, the Japanese yarn market has also turned downwards.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened flat this morning. Customers were also not urgently buying goods. In addition, the atmosphere was calm, and general trading activity decreased. Therefore, the opening prices were not much different from the previous day. 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse goods were priced at 587 yuan, and warehouse receipts were priced at 571 yuan. Soon, Hong Kong firms took some purchasing action, and the price of 20-count Special Golden City was still 690 yuan. The market was tight. Double Horse foreign warehouse goods were priced at 590 yuan, and warehouse receipts were priced at 574 yuan. Prices recovered slightly by 1 to 2 yuan at the closing. Yong'an Factory opened 80 bales of 20-count Special Golden City for 690 yuan and 10 bales of 10-count Special Golden City for 640 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,325 bales were traded, compared to 200 bales traded the previous day. Prices: 20-count Double Horse fell by 2 yuan, Shepherd fell by 1 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. The amounts bought by various firms are listed on the left: Hong Kong 555, Fellow Traders 600, Mainland 170, Total 1325.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has entered a flat and weak trend. Because of the consecutive days of rapid increases, there is a slight sign of reaction. This is also to be expected. The price of 20-count Yueqin for next month is 460 yuan, also falling quickly.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Firms Sell at Low Prices, Trading is Exceptionally Active</h3>
<p>Transactions of native cotton are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Only Yuan Yihao bought 120 pieces. However, the Indian cotton business is developing more and more. Chinese merchants at Yong'an Factory are actively purchasing, totaling 1,600 pieces, all sold in cash by fellow traders. Xinsheng Yarn Factory also has an appetite. Mutual buying and selling among other fellow traders is still active, with most of the cotton being delivered to Japanese factories. Cotton prices are unusually firm and showing an upward trend. Market prices are more than 10 yuan cheaper than the prices directly ordered overseas from foreign firms. The firms are also seeking to sell at low prices due to cash flow and position reasons. There are only 65 bales of Tonghua cotton from northern Jiangsu. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai today. The British Company's "Jeypore" ship, loaded with 3,211 tons of cotton from Mumbai, about 10,000+ bales, is scheduled to arrive at the port at 7:00 AM today, scheduled to moor at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>Another message: Although the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has slightly improved recently, this raw cotton is limited to the goods in the hands of fellow traders, because their prices are still more than 20 yuan cheaper than the prices quoted by foreign firms. The main buyers recently are still Japanese manufacturers. Due to cash flow issues, the payment terms are all two weeks after delivery. Their inventory is low. It is said that the existing cotton is not enough for three or four weeks. If such transactions can be maintained for one week, all the goods in the hands of fellow traders will be absorbed. Then, the fellow traders will order from foreign firms at high prices. Therefore, according to this situation, there is still a day of prosperity for foreign cotton trading.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market prices were more fatigued yesterday. The opening was still firm, but the reports from the cotton-growing regions suddenly reported well, and there was a lack of major buyers in the market. Washington Street selling was also very strong. Spot transactions in the South were quiet. Many long positions were cashed out by the traders, and it finally closed at the lowest price. As a result, it fell 8 to 10 points compared to the previous day. India also showed fatigue. Yesterday, including forecasts, it fell 1.5 rupees. Egypt rose 3 to 5 points.</p>
<h3>Cloth: Chinese Factories Busy Rushing to Deliver Orders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation was slightly more peaceful. Factories are gradually selling spot and this month's white cloth, totaling nearly 1,000 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. Shenxin Factory's Fugui fine cloth opened at a price of 18.5 yuan. Thread tweed, serge, flannel, and grey cloth previously scheduled to be shipped are now being listed with higher prices. Shipping activities, factories are busy rushing to deliver orders. Dyeing factories have also resumed work one after another. Sales are most prosperous in Southeast Asia, Siam, Singapore and other places, purchasing over 10,000 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, floral cloth, and hemp yarn. Guangdong firms purchased over 4,000 bolts of colored serge and thread tweed. Many inexpensive orders are still being placed in this street. New goods are being sold at high prices, and buying interest has turned weak. However, dyeing factories purchased over 200 bales of colored cloth, colored twill, and cotton poplin grey cloth.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Yesterday, the white cloth market was really quiet, and selling prices returned to fatigue. The Longtou fine cloth was actively speculated, rising and falling suddenly. The highest price for this month was 16.89 yuan per bolt, and the low price fell to 16.5 yuan. The after-market rose again to 16.75 yuan. The futures price for next month is 17.2 yuan. Other fine cloths such as Yanghe, Wufu, and Laba Tong all fell uniformly by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. The fine twill was relatively stable. Tianjin firms slightly sold some forward fine cloth. Dyeing factories in this street did not buy much, relying only on the minds of fellow traders to make a business. 600-700 pieces were traded, but the firm's opening price was still more expensive than the market price. Yi Shu ordered one hundred and several dozens of Longtou fine cloth for September, priced at 17.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Illicit Buying and Selling of Rice is Exceptionally Rampant, Transactions Reach More Than Double the Quantity of Rice in the Pot; Thick Rice, 23 Yuan</h3>
<p>Du Rice: Because the store has been empty for a long time, purchases continue. However, to avoid price controls, there is no trading in the market. It is heard that there are many transactions outside the market, with thick rice priced at over 23 yuan and high-quality rice priced at 19 yuan. There have been no arrivals from below yesterday. 1,300-1,400 bags of wheeled buns came from Fengjing. People's hearts are high, and the market continues to rise. Where will it end? As for the transactions within the market, it is estimated that 16 yuan was charged for special quality rice, 16 yuan for rice, 22.5 yuan for variable rice, and 13 yuan for Hong Kong glutinous rice, totaling over 2,000 bags. The transactions outside the market are more than three times that of the market.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice: Yesterday's market was even more chaotic. The selling price of high-quality Ke Xian rice must exceed the limit by 2-3 yuan, and the price of medium and second-class rice increased by 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, or 0.8 yuan. High-quality rice must also exceed the limit by 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. Only second-class rice and brown rice are priced within 16 yuan. However, buying interest in this street is still greedy. The 17 yuan second-class Xian rice has been bought up in one go. The large market rice at 23 yuan is particularly active. The suppliers are unwilling to sell all the orders.</p>
<p>Flour: Retail transactions are active. Customer firms repeatedly requested factory prices based on exchange rates, but the factory refused to open exchange rate unified prices except for once offering a special price of 6 yuan for exchange rate, and the exchange rate increased or decreased, resulting in approximately 30,000+ bags being traded. The second plant's disk still required 5 yuan in cash, the difference between the goods and the factory's board was low by five cents to one cent.</p>
<p>Wheat: New wheat is arriving from the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways at a rate of 20-30 carts per day. Both China and Japan factories are thinking of taking it, but the purchasing power is very harsh. Yesterday, both Fuxin and Fufeng factories and hoarders were purchasing. The market tightened by a few cents to a few jiao. The factory purchased old Hunan, Luhe, Puzhen, and Wuxi wheat totaling 6-7 carts, priced at 6.6-6.7 yuan. In addition, hoarders purchased Nanjing, Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Yongguan Dian, and other wheat totaling 11 carts, priced at 6.63-7.08 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Cart White is Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London electricity, the sugar market fell again, with December at 6 shillings, March next year at 6 shillings 1 pence, and June at 6 shillings 1 pence 25. The city's association plan also saw a continued soft price, and the spot 24 crude white was slightly lower at 1 to 2 cent, the local warehouse was at 32.3 yuan, the foreign warehouse was at 32.1 yuan, the transit cargo was 500 bags, 24 yuan, and the old cargo was 23.7 yuan, 100 bags. The Taikoo cart white was slightly lower at 3 to 4 cent, the Western warehouse B mark was 37.8 yuan, the CW mark was 37.4 yuan, the OX mark was 37 yuan, the DY mark was 36.8 yuan, and the HX mark was 36.6 yuan. The Dutch red had no much fluctuations, the spot was at 28.6 yuan, and the transit was at 21.8 yuan. The local cotton white was slightly lower by half, the Zhenji No. 1 was at 32.5 yuan, and the No. 2, 3, and 4 were retired. The national sugar was still lacking continuous opening.</p>
<h3>Market News Roundup</h3>
<p>Oil Market: Actual sales are stagnant, and the market has slightly reduced by 3-4 cents. 120 barrels of Dalian oil were opened throughout the day, and 160 barrels of Dalian oil and 10 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil arrived from Kobe. As for peanut oil, only a transit cargo of 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil was made.</p>
<p>Dried Lily Flower: Due to the inconvenience of transportation, Huaibei vegetables have been lacking in Shanghai for a long time. A customer tried dozens of bags that have arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Ziji Dingzhuang vegetables were sold, priced at 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Hardware: Yesterday, Tianjin Yan and Qingdao Gang jointly searched for 500-600 bundles of plain white iron, so the standard market price returned high 0.4-0.5 yuan, such as the current sale price of 2.7 yuan per 36-foot sheet, and 3.25 yuan for 37-foot sheets.</p>
<p>Coal: Indian coal is again beneficial to Shanghai. The "Harlingen" managed by Jardine Matheson has transported 8,085 tons of coal from Calcutta, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, moored at floats 33 and 34, waiting for unloading and transshipment. As for the Wen coal market, the price has risen to 5 yuan per load due to the lack of continued arrivals, and the firm will handle it themselves.</p>
<p>Camel Wool: Weilun Tiger picture is sold at 3.9 yuan per yard, Weiyi Shuanglu plain color is sold at 2.4 yuan for No. 1, 2.1 yuan for No. 2, striped No. 1 is 2.4 yuan, No. 2 is 1.85 yuan, and Fine Arts is 3.25 yuan, and all groups are making purchase.</p>
<h3>The Impossible "One Currency Plan"</h3>
<p>— Xie Juhui</p>
<p>Because of the repeated decline in the foreign exchange black market and the increasingly severe fluctuations in the exchange market, the "One Currency Plan" editorial appeared in the North-China Daily News on July 22nd. It is said that many parties believe that now is the time for the Shanghai Municipal Council to start investigating ways to issue its own currency. The most noteworthy proposal is that the Shanghai Municipal Council should peg its currency to the British pound or the US dollar, using a small amount of circulation with the most complete management, as Hong Kong and Singapore are good examples. Although the exact level to which it should be pegged is still to be determined through broad consultation, the majority advocates that it should be pegged at a level higher than the current exchange rate, believing it should be set between eight pence and eight and a half pence. A currency committee should be organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the committee would be responsible to the Shanghai Municipal Council for managing the issuance of banknotes. Each yuan of banknotes must be backed by a 100% reserve of British gold or US dollars. For example, if issued at eight and a half pence, if a bank applies to the committee for 500,000 yuan in banknotes, it must deposit 17,708 pounds, 6 shillings, and 8 pence in British gold. If the market later feels that the supply of this banknote exceeds demand, the committee should redeem these 500,000 banknotes at eight pence, using 16,666 pounds, 13 shillings, and 4 pence in British gold. According to this method, this banknote has its own reserves, and most of the reserves can be freed up for investment, only needing to retain the usual reserve amount to cope with withdrawals. The conclusion is that if this move can get on track, it will benefit all parties for various reasons.</p>
<p>After this article was published, it immediately aroused the response of foreigners in Shanghai. English and French newspapers in the city have commented on it every day. A few days ago, the North-China Daily News further detailed the desire and welcome of all parties for this move in a prominent position. Some believe that it may be inconvenient for the Shanghai Municipal Council to do this, and it may be better for bankers to step in instead, and claim that if the Chinese government and others do not object, a major foreign bank in the city is prepared to consider issuing it. Therefore, this proposal is gradually tending towards implementation.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the standpoint of the citizens of Shanghai, we naturally cannot remain silent about this, and dare to write our opinions below.</p>
<p>First, we dare to say that the motivation for this proposal is only for the Shanghai Municipal Council and foreign firms to maintain a balance of payments, which does not seem to be worth making such a fuss about. Because in the same way that the burden on taxpayers or citizens is increased, why not be straightforward and quick, and imitate shipping companies in using Hong Kong dollars or other subsidiary coins to calculate taxes and utility costs, which is simpler. If it is really for the happiness of all Shanghai citizens, then the result of this move is probably the opposite of what is expected. It should be known that the current sharp contraction and chaos in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the stagnation of the market, and the instability of social life are entirely due to the cessation of the supply of foreign exchange by the equalization fund, and various rumors have taken advantage of the opportunity, causing the public to doubt the legal tender. In that case, in order to seek the stability of the people's lives and the vitality of the market, the municipal authorities should be doing their best to maintain the credit of the legal tender, how can they add insult to injury and create a new currency to disrupt the market? More than two years have passed since the outbreak of the war, and the Chinese legal tender has not shown any signs of malicious expansion, which is an ironclad fact recognized by both Chinese and foreigners. Although the Chongqing side announced the other day that the recent issuance of the Central Agricultural Bank of China totaled 260 billion yuan, an increase of about 120 billion yuan compared with before the war, its gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves still accounted for 44%, which is still higher than other countries. Moreover, these newly issued legal tender are mostly circulating in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, replacing the provincial banknotes of the past, which is different from malicious expansion. As for the amount of legal tender circulating in Shanghai and other places, it is even more limited; and the implementation of the remittance system has further helped to tighten the legal tender. At the same time, if the decline in the foreign exchange black market is calculated according to the current market price, then the value of the gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves under the name of the legal tender is of course far more than 44%. All these facts show that the German mark and ruble during the European War cannot be used to compare with the Chinese legal tender. And the reason why the legal tender has reached the current state is entirely due to the imbalance of supply and demand, and the situation caused by the war. Not only because of the huge import surplus, but also for various other reasons, such as the successive issuance of "Joint Reserve Notes" and "Huaxing Notes", and the control of export trade in the occupied areas, and the interception of customs revenue, all of which have caused significant blows to the legal tender. If everyone can recognize this point, they will not doubt the legal tender!</p>
<p>Putting aside whether the Shanghai Municipal Council enjoys the right to issue currency under the land regulations, and whether this move violates the China policy of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries and undermines Chinese national law, judging from the effect of the Shanghai Municipal Council issuing banknotes alone, it is probably only equal to zero. Even if this banknote is backed by 100% foreign exchange reserves, if the holder cannot freely exchange it for foreign exchange, then what is the difference between the "Joint Reserve Notes", which nominally stand at one shilling and two pence, and the "Huaxing Notes" at six pence? At this time of market volatility, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly issuing a new currency should not imply to the citizens that the future of the legal tender is unpredictable, which will inevitably accelerate the flight of citizens' funds, and at the same time, the new currency will be calculated. The result of this move is that since it cannot be freely exchanged for foreign exchange, it will certainly not gain the trust of the citizens. As a result, the legal tender will suffer another blow, and the value of the new currency will not necessarily be stronger than the legal tender, only making the market more chaotic and the economy more devastated! Conversely, if this new currency is determined to be freely convertible to foreign exchange at a price of eight and a half pence, then in the current situation of rumors, the people's welcome of foreign exchange will certainly be greater than that of the new currency guaranteed by foreign exchange. Looking at the work of the equalization fund in the past few months, a capital of 10 million pounds is not enough to fill the insatiable desires of speculators and capital flighters, and how can the Shanghai Municipal Council's meager foreign exchange fund maintain this unchanged for a long time, who would believe this?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, assuming that this new currency is fully prepared, has a stable value, and is welcomed by all sectors of the city, then according to Gresham's law, it will immediately be absorbed and hoarded by all parties, and they will not be willing to use it. If the only currency circulating in the Shanghai market is still the legal tender, which is regarded as having "unstable value", then wouldn't the Shanghai Municipal Council be doing something unnecessary and wasting their time?</p>
<p>Some may say that the Hong Kong banknotes are stable at one shilling and three pence, and have stood firm until now, why can't the Shanghai Municipal Council do it? It should be known that the position of Hong Kong is different from that of Shanghai. First, its monetary system was established when the Chinese monetary system was stable; second, Hong Kong can be divided into an economic unit and isolated from China, while Shanghai is a major port of China, connected with the mainland, and even now, it is impossible to form an economic unit alone. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council is only a municipal institution, and has no power to control or control customs, judiciary, administration, and finance, so how can it make its branch banknotes circulate unimpeded?</p>
<p>Therefore, our conclusion is that this is an impossible "one currency plan"!</p>

<h3>400,000 Yuan of Stamps</h3>
<p>— (Xin Meng)</p>
<p>How to Dispose of Fen Coins After Issuance</p>
<p>There is Already a Surplus in the Market, Small Vendors and Merchants Suffer Losses</p>
<p>Since copper fen coins disappeared from the Shanghai market, stamps have been used as a substitute in the absence of other options. Initially, various stamps such as one-fen, two-fen, and five-fen stamps were circulating in the market, and there was still a shortage, which made general merchants feel inconvenienced. However, soon the number of stamps circulating in the market increased day by day. After a short two months, not only was there no shortage, but stamps were everywhere, and there was already a surplus.</p>
<p>According to the statement released by the post office, there are currently 400,000 yuan of stamps circulating in the Shanghai market. We know that fen coins are being rushed into printing and will soon be circulating in the market. When fen coins are circulated, the discontinuation of stamps is inevitable, but how to dispose of these 400,000 yuan of stamps has become a major problem.</p>
<p>The author recently visited several stores in the neighborhood, both large and small, and they all said that they had accumulated a lot of stamps, a few yuan for small stores and dozens of yuan for large stores. Because of the increasing amount of stamps coming in and the small amount going out, most stores have adopted another method: stamps can be used for purchases under five fen, but for purchases over six fen, you must use jiao (ten-fen) notes, which is an expedient measure to remedy the excessive inflow of stamps.</p>
<p>At the same time, several stores, because they have accumulated a lot of stamps and have no way to get rid of them, and they are still coming in every day, have come up with another method: hanging a sign at the door saying "This store sells stamps at 105 fen per yuan". One yuan is 5 fen cheaper, although it can attract some owners and housewives who know how to calculate to exchange stamps, but the effect is not great, and it still cannot clear out the stamps. Therefore, some people are even willing to discount the stamps further, selling one yuan for 110 fen, and I heard that some even sell for 120 fen.</p>
<p>The small vendors in the vegetable market and the children selling newspapers, which one doesn't have a handful of loose stamps in their hands? These small vendors and small merchants do not accept stamps when buying rice, firewood, or wholesale goods. So when you go to buy newspapers or things, you will often be begged by people to give them jiao notes to change, and not to give them stamps.</p>
<p>Extending this to the small vendors in the alleyways and the handicraft workers, there is not one who does not have a matchbox full of stamps. They don't want to use them when they are dirty, and they are worthless when they are torn. Everyone feels a kind of pain and inconvenience with stamps, but if you don't accept stamps, you won't have any business, which is also inevitable.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the surplus of stamps in the cloth is an ironclad fact. How to dispose of 400,000 yuan of stamps in the market after the fen coins are circulated in the future, whether the post office will be accommodating and take them back, is indeed a question. Stamps are originally good for sending letters, but if they are used for sending letters, they cannot be used up in a short time; and some are dirty and will be rejected. Larger stores can still handle a few yuan of stamps without causing major problems, but small merchants and vendors, who earn money one day and spend it the next, cannot afford to have one yuan or a few jiao of stamps stuck in their hands, and maybe they won't even have capital left and can't do business anymore, so this problem is serious!</p>
<h3>Small Teacher's Cooperative</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Let's Cultivate This Little Life Together!</p>
<p>I would like to report on the general situation of the Small Teacher's Cooperative in this city after Mr. Langlang introduced the Silver and Money Industry Cooperative.</p>
<p>The Small Teacher's Cooperative was established seven months ago. It has more than 500 members and has a fairly tight organization. The articles of association stipulate that each share is one yuan of national currency, and each member can subscribe to a maximum of 20 shares. Moreover, regardless of the number of shares, each member has only one vote when electing. This can avoid the manipulation of large shareholders, which is very reasonable.</p>
<p>Because the members and business scope are limited to elementary schools, the society has set up a branch station in several central locations of the school in addition to setting up a general office. Each station has a station manager responsible for receiving and sending delivery orders and goods, and each district also has a main station for receiving and sending delivery orders and goods from each branch station. The general office has one staff member and several workers who are responsible for purchasing and distributing. In this way, although the delivery cannot be too quick due to the lack of staff, the workers of the general office will ride a bicycle to deliver the goods to you no later than 24 hours after the goods order is submitted.</p>
<p>So far, the Small Teacher's Cooperative has contacted more than 50 manufacturers or merchants and can get special treatment. Companies such as Gong Sheng Rice Shop, Guohua Coal Ball Company, China Chemical Industry Society, Family Industry Society, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Sino-French Pharmacy, China National Goods Company, and sweat shirt factories such as Zhenfeng, Wuhe, and Guohua have all expressed their sympathy and given special discounts. However, because the number of members is not enough and the financial resources are insufficient, all aspects have certainly not yet reached the ideal goal. From now on, on the one hand, we will rely on the efforts of the original members, and on the other hand, we will rely on the sympathy and assistance of people from all walks of life to cultivate this little life well.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Fireworks Show Hometown Village Cooperation, Billowing Waves and Myriad Miles of Yinghai Aviation</p>
<p>It flies directly between Chongqing, China, and Alameda, carrying passengers and mail. Later, the Xinjiang region of China gradually prospered, and flights to Gansu, Chengdu, Shaanxi and other places became more frequent and connected with the Soviet Union. As for Central Asia, it is all high mountains and sandy plains, and China has no time to reach it for a while, so it has to let the Soviet Union develop air routes. Moreover, those long-range aircraft, in the first ten years, with a load of 100 tons and carrying 100 passengers, using six engines, everyone already felt very surprised. Who knew that in the past few years, aircraft with a load of 500 tons and carrying hundreds of passengers have been regarded as commonplace. Today, I will not talk about world aviation, but let’s talk about why He Liyu thought that starting this silk weaving factory must go to the United States. It is most important to investigate the fashion of foreign silk fabrics, and it is best to buy machines with someone who is knowledgeable. Moreover, she took the Pan American Pacific aircraft to go there. After the investigation in the United States, she can take the Atlantic aircraft from the United States to Europe. After traveling freely in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and other countries, she turned back to Paris, France, and took the China-France Airlines aircraft to return to Shanghai. It can take one month at most, or two weeks at least, and everything can be done comfortably. However, this matter, of course, must also be reported to her father. The third thing is about the start-up expenses for starting this silk weaving factory. With money, then you can do things, build houses, buy machines, rent land, recruit workers, everything needs money. Is this money still transferred from the north? Or is it drawn from the bank nearby? As far as Mr. He is concerned, his financial aspects are very active. There are several banks in Shanghai that have dealings with Mr. He. He also serves as a director of several private banks, such as Guangdong Bank and Overseas Chinese Bank. The people in the bank who know Mr. He also know his twin daughters. Moreover, when Mr. He left, he signed his checkbook and handed it to his two daughters. When they needed money, they just wrote the amount and went to the bank to withdraw it. But if these two daughters used a few thousand yuan, they could withdraw it without first informing their father. If they used tens of thousands of yuan, they must first ask for their father's instructions. Moreover, this silk weaving factory is a joint-stock company, and there are several shareholder uncles. How are their shares to be delivered? Or which bank will transfer them from? Will the shares be paid in full at once? Or will they be paid a certain amount first? All of this must be reported to their father. During the preparation period, it is best to hire an accountant. (167)</p>
<h3>A Public Letter to All Newspaper Readers</h3>
<p>Dear Readers:</p>
<p>Our Association has been publishing articles in Shen Bao and other newspapers for a long time, and you must have seen them. Many people have written to ask questions, which shows that you are all paying attention! However, because of the limited space in the newspapers, the articles are always brief and not detailed enough. I am afraid that you do not understand them very well. Now there is a better opportunity, that is, starting from August 3rd in the Gregorian calendar, a sermon meeting will be held simultaneously in all large and small Christian churches in this city, starting at 7:30 every night. Anyone can go to listen. Please bring your relatives and friends to the nearest church to listen to the gospel of Jesus saving the world. If you have any questions to ask? You can ask the preachers face to face so that they can answer them at that time. This is a rare opportunity, so don't miss it. Text Evangelism Association, Postal Box 1227</p>
<h3>A Living Budget Table</h3>
<p>— TC</p>
<p>The prices in Shanghai are soaring every day, which makes ordinary office workers cry out in pain. Not only do they have to maintain the lives of their families, but they also have to bear the education expenses of their children, the exchange of gifts, the addition of clothes..., it is really too hard to cope with. Therefore, recently, many people have taken risks because they cannot cope with life, and the weak, although gritting their teeth and using all their strength to struggle to barely maintain, are also at the end of their rope, a clever woman cannot cook without rice.</p>
<p>I have a relative who has a family of four: a husband and wife and two children. He is an office worker in a large company on Nanjing Road, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan; his wife is an elementary school teacher in a small school, with a monthly salary of 15 yuan. Their total income is 65 yuan per month. However, in Shanghai, where prices are soaring, it is not easy to support a family of four and bear all miscellaneous expenses with this, so they often feel the pain of not being able to make ends meet. In recent months, they have made a living budget table, and every month's expenses are paid according to the budget table, and they dare not neglect it at all. Now their family's life is not only stable, but also has a little surplus. It can be seen that the budget table is of great help to small office workers who are struggling to make ends meet. Now I will copy it below and introduce it to all the small office workers who feel that life is difficult. I hope that you will also make a budget table from today and pay according to it, and also get a happy life.</p>
<p>Income:</p>
<p>65 yuan</p>
<p>Expenditure:</p>
<p>Rent (room in a lane): 15 yuan</p>
<p>Food (two meals): 17 yuan (Editor's note: If it is two meals, lunch and dinner, it is definitely not so cheap; if it is one meal, how to solve the other meal?)</p>
<p>Other expenses: about 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Prepare for gifts: 4 yuan (surplus is accumulated to prepare for special circumstances).</p>
<p>Central Savings Society (quarterly subscription): 3 yuan (if you win a small or medium prize or the last number, it will be used to buy clothes and utensils, etc.)</p>
<p>Buy clothes (accumulated monthly): 7 yuan</p>
<p>Education expenses (accumulated monthly): 3 yuan</p>
<p>Movies (once a week, ticket price is between 15 and 33 fen)</p>
<p>Transportation expenses: about 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Total expenditure is 60 yuan, total income is 65 yuan</p>
<p>There is still 5 yuan left each month to make up for special circumstances.</p>
<h3>Beautiful Grasses and Ladies</h3>
<p>Bai Hua</p>
<p>"The Lady's From Kentucky"</p>
<p>Produced by Paramount Pictures, Showing at Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen many movies with horse racing as the theme. The motivation for making these types of movies, I guess, has the following points:</p>
<p>(1) In the vast horse farm, there are strong horses galloping. Due to the excellent photography conditions, very beautiful exterior scenes can be filmed. If color films such as "Fragrant Colt and Precious Horse" can be filmed, they will naturally be even more beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) The romance between men and women is the key to the victory or defeat of the final horse race, giving the audience stimulation in a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>But the production skills of this "Beautiful Grasses and Ladies" are really too mediocre. There is neither a clear theme nor a tortuous and bizarre story. Even the romance that runs through this story is very forced.</p>
<p>The director's skills are also poor. It is not worth spending so much film to introduce Marty Black's appearance. The progress of the whole film is plain and dull. For example, Black secretly ordered his friend Moss to take "Reminson" (horse name) to participate in the competition. Although "Reminson" won the championship, he was young and extremely tired, and Penny hated Black for this. This is the most important key to this film, like a transition in writing an article, but the director also lightly let it go. The insertion of these two comical roles of Hub Herbert and Chai Su Xuci is also very stiff. In short, the director has only done his job of introducing the story.</p>
<p>George Rafford's Marty Black and Alan Qulu are average, because there is no acting to do.</p>

<h3>Poverty</h3>
<p>— Xue Xin</p>
<p>Most "poor boys" are proud and arrogant, but those who talk about sorrow and bitterness are singing a high tune, a disgrace to poverty.</p>
<p>"Poor but not poor in ambition" is backbone, "poor in virtue and also poor in ambition" is boneless. "Poor to the extreme" and not writing "boring articles" of major and special works is ambitious and has personality.</p>
<p>If "exhausted and exposed ugliness", it is better to "pretend to be poor and protect oneself".</p>
<p>"Poor and fierce" and "poor and think hard" are "poor and indiscriminate".</p>
<p>"Poor though poor, there are still three loads of copper", not poor but making a fuss about poverty is "the stupidity of today".</p>
<p>"Poor but should be stronger" is "poor in people" not "poor in virtue", "old but should be stronger" is "encouraging old age" not "relying on old age".</p>
<p>"Poverty desires solidity", can you not consider its virtue. "Old horses turn back into young colts", can you not consider their future.</p>
<p>Compatriots, the plan of "do not pursue the poor enemy", except for those who abandon virtue, all can be pursued.</p>

<h3>The Products of Shanghai Film Companies in the Past Six Months</h3>
<p>— Dehui</p>
<p>In the past six months, Shanghai film companies have released a total of 21 films that have been publicly screened.

<p>Random Notes on Artists</p>
<h3>Anecdotes and Reflections on My Film Career (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>——A Conversation with Ms. Tan Ying</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Tan Ying has been in the film industry for many years and has a profound history. Her style is known for its romanticism, earning her the reputation of the "Oriental Garbo." In recent years, she has devoted herself to the arts, achieving even greater success. By reviewing her past experiences in the film industry, we can see that every successful actor has their own reasons for success. Her cinematic perspective, "Art is eternal," is also very practical and highly admirable.</p>
<p>I am also a standard film narrator; thinking about things from eight years ago is quite amusing.</p>
<p>During my school days, after finishing my homework every day, I was eager to go to the movies. I watched films at least twice a week. I was born somewhat neurotic, and my sensitivity seemed unusually keen. After watching each film, I would always quietly think and imitate the various expressions of Lillian Gish, Greta Garbo, and others. Sometimes, I would even wail to the sky, and tears would stream down my face. The next day at school, I would eagerly recount and act out the film I had seen the day before in front of many classmates, crying and laughing to my heart's content. Everyone watched with great interest and often said, "Ah Tan's expressions are really good; she will definitely be a movie star in the future." Who knew that I would actually end up making a living in the film industry? I find it extremely amusing!</p>
<p>Initially, at the age of seventeen, I happened to visit Mr. Dan Duyu's Shanghai Film Company to watch Ms. Ruan Lingyu filming "Yu Tang Chun." Mr. Dan saw me wearing a set of blue cloth children's clothes, jumping around, and said, "Wonderful! This big kid is so much fun!" Then he asked me, "Do you like making movies?" I said, "Making movies is what I like to do the most." The next day, I went to have photos taken and audition various poses and expressions. As a result, Mr. Dan was very satisfied. Soon after, he assigned me to star in a film called "A Lost Footing." Although it was my first time, the various expressions that seemed to come naturally, as if "without a teacher, self-taught," did not feel difficult at all. They praised me, saying that I had a great talent for acting. In reality, it was nothing more than a long-accumulated passion that I took the opportunity to unleash boldly. Looking back, it was really quite comical.</p>

<h3>Sun Yukun Strives to Improve</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Indeed, Sun Yukun's decline is a great loss to the Wusheng (martial male) actors. He has an excellent foundation, and if he could strive for artistic achievement, his future would be limitless. It is a pity that he does not cherish himself and has gradually declined, which is why people feel sorry for him. He is the nephew of Yu Zhenting, the son of veteran actor Sun Dixiang, and a student of renowned teacher Fan Futai. Born into a Peking Opera family, he initially followed his uncle Yu Zhenting, hence the name "Little Zhenting." Later, he diligently studied Yang Xiaolou and became the most lifelike imitator of Yang Xiaolou among the rising stars. Some even praised him with the words "Sun Yukun is the successor to Yang Xiaolou's art." Logically, he should strive to improve, but his laziness is deeper than anyone else's, and he has gradually become disliked. Up until now, after experiencing many difficulties, he has realized his past mistakes. Therefore, he has given up all bad habits and is working hard every day. I heard that he is practicing martial arts in his private residence, preparing to strive to improve and form his own troupe after autumn. I hope he can realize his mistakes and turn back, as it is not too late to restore his former reputation. Otherwise, his life will indeed be over, and the Peking Opera world will lose a useful talent, which would be a pity.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden (Opera World)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Differences Between Inviting Actors Then and Now</p>
<p>There is another point: according to the rules of the past, anyone who was severely beaten for secretly luring away actors, resulting in serious injuries, would be at a disadvantage even if they went to court. And if things went badly, they might even be convicted of a crime and deported back to their hometown by the local government. Logically speaking, if someone secretly lures away the pillar of the troupe while the business is doing well and the opera is being performed successfully, the troupe would have to close down immediately. At that time, transportation was inconvenient, and it was usually too late to invite a new actor. However, the food and expenses for dozens of people backstage had to be provided as usual every day. Wouldn't the owner suffer a great loss? Therefore, at least the person who lured away the actor would be convicted of disrupting other people's business in an unruly and illegal manner. Moreover, the local magistrate would undoubtedly favor the people within his jurisdiction. Once he caught someone doing something wrong, he would definitely punish them severely. That is why I said earlier that anyone who came to lure away an actor had to be a tough guy, or it would be completely useless.</p>
<p>Given that luring away actors was so difficult as described above, how could it often happen that good actors eloped? It turns out that each industry has its own special means. Even if the owner takes strict precautions, as long as they are determined to lure someone away, they will eventually achieve their goal. It is impossible to guard against everything. When the person luring the actor first arrives, they still pretend to be a merchant. If they feel that their abilities are slightly lacking, they sometimes bring one or two helpers. After arriving at the destination, it is better to stay at the home of a local acquaintance if possible. Otherwise, they have to stay in a hotel. During the day, when there is nothing to do, they will find some buyers on the street for the inexpensive local products they brought with them, in order to conceal their intentions from the people in the hotel. In the afternoon or evening, when there is nothing to do, they will go to the theater to take a walk.</p>
