<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本最近之作為</h3>
<p>平心而論，日本人自有日本人之長處，未可輕加菲薄而謂爲一無足稱；然以日本而企圖兼併統一告成後之中國，則爲利令智昏；遂致所如輒左，一無是處。最近彼在軍事外交政治方面所作所爲，俱出中智之下；此豈愚昧，徒以自蔽於貪耳。</p>
<p>茲於指陳近事之前，請略一追遡往事：日本乘中國之天災人禍而有九一八之役；誠使度德量力，自此保泰持盈，竭其全能，孜孜矻矻以經營關外，則閱八載而至今日，不但在關外得立較今堅實之基礎，即在今日國際壇玷之上，亦以舉足重輕而得顧盼稱雄；藉曰未然，歐戰至少爲彼造就經濟上之又一黃金時代，此可斷言也。顧乃得寸進尺，窺伺平津，好大喜功，瘋在不知自制。至中國西安事變，證明中國民族以精誠感格而趨融和；日本至是應憬然覺悟，改弦易轍矣，然而未然。至蘆溝橋事變，證明中國朝野軍民爲最後關頭而完全統一；日本至是應勒馬懸崖，幡然改圖矣，然而未然。忽視統一告成後之中國之不可侮，猶以速戰速決爲快意之圖，遂一誤再誤而自誤至於今日。</p>
<p>今日如何？就軍事言之，爲所佔領之點綫而疲於奔命，在湘北採取大規模攻勢而終於失敗，此皆不可掩諱，姑不具論；試問分兵進攻廣西，究竟有何意義，有何價值？就外交言之，對德，對蘇，對英法，盡其搬弄之技，窮其妍醜之態，無所成就；此猶得諉其原因於德蘇英法諸國之徬徨遊移；致使日本之法術不騐，亦姑置小論；試問趨奉美國而以揚言開放長江下游爲策略，究竟有何功用，有何希望？就政治言之，所作所爲於北平與南京者，不必論；所謂協同體，所謂新秩序，不必論；和平詎非戰爭之當然結束，顧乃東京相率陳說「大乘」法，依然不脫小家氣；徒見其不能忘情於擒縱，但擒縱不得耳；此物此志，南轅北轍，試問有何蹊徑，有何前途？凡是者，豈我人故意菲蒲之哉，實屬、一無是處！</p>
<p>日本人有其孜孜矻矻，鍥而不舍之長，以此研討學術，經營企業，輒能深入而成功；獨以此精神，企圖兼併所不能兼併之中國，則自誤之甚。最近彼所悉力以赴者，在軍事上之進攻廣西，在外交上之趨奉美國，在政治上之號召和平，皆因思慮爲一念之貪而麻木；斯隔靴搔癢而不自覺，蓋軍事方面或則釜底抽薪，或則出奇制勝；此在戰爭最初階段，容有一舉成功之希望，及久戰兩年半，則絕無僥倖奏效之可能。日本各路進攻，不獲一逞而驟襲廣西；知者斷言於戰略上絕無理由，不知者或覺莫測高深；及其將領致電廣西軍民長官李宗仁白崇禧黃旭初諸氏，誘以妥協，始暴露日方之痴願；於是而知大吹大擂之北海登陸，乃爲軍事上毫無辦法之嘗試。此類售試，在中智者所知其必不效而必不爲，而日人爲之。外交方面，推動他國之方法不一，或責以條的義務，或誘以利害關係，或動以正義與感情；若美國對遠東問題，則條的與利害以及正義感情，允完全合一者也；則日本之所以推動美國者，惟有尊重美國有關之條的，尊重美國利益，務合正義，務修感情，此外作爲，豈有功用，豈有希望。日本乃於久加侵蝕，屢决失信之後，僅僅揚言所謂準備開放長江下游，便望博得美人心迴意轉；此在具有常識者可以知其無效，而日人竟作此痴願。政治方面，中國有其絕對標準，即主權領土行政之完整是也；日本能尊重此標準，則中國人無不願息戰言和；不能副此標準，即使有人與日本簽署何種條的，戰爭依然不得結束，和平依然不得實現，日本依然不能自拔於泥淖；此中關鍵，簡單明瞭。顧乃日本旣不能眞誠尊重中國所持之絕對標準，却想自拔於泥淖而宰制和平之佳境。總而言之，日人自非愚昧，但今日確猶未能恢復其正常之理智；較之一年前之瘋在，則漸决恢復其矇昧之意識。故知軍事方面狠鬬無效，惟有妥協；外交方面不容一意孤行，務須取得他國諒解；政治方面須向中國求和平；徒以矇昧，遂如盲人瞎馬。自矇昧以迄淸明通透，始猶待時日歟。</p>
<h3>胡大使謁美總統　報告抗戰現勢　謂各前綫已採取攻勢　羅斯福總統頗為興奮</h3>
<p>華盛頓　中國駐美大使胡適博士、本日晋謁羅斯福總統、告以中國軍隊已在各處前綫採取攻勢、並於事後向報界發表談話云、「吾國處境、初不如一般人所想像之困難、余所告知羅斯福總統者、即爲此意、以運輸而論、廣西省被侵之後、某處交通綫雖已梗斷、但無關重要、吾人現正添築新路、以資替代、吾國軍隊正在各處前綫採取攻勢、不久必更有捷報傳來、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　中國駐美大使胡適、昨日晋謁羅斯福總統、報告中國抵抗日軍侵略之樂觀情形、上星期總統在白宮舉行外交宴會時、曾邀請胡適往白宮一晤、故胡適昨日前往赴約、胡氏聲稱、「余告總統、中國情勢並非如一般人所理想者之沮喪、總統對此甚感興奮、余並告總統謂、日軍侵犯華南截斷中國交通錢、對中國抗戰、並無若何重大關係、吾人現正建築新公路、以便獲致新接濟、」胡適續稱、華軍正回各綫日軍施行攻擊、並表示「吾人即將聆聽更多之勝利消息「胡氏對羅斯福總統備加稱道、指為「世界上最熟悉國際情勢者之一」、（二十一日合衆電）</p>
<h3>美對日德蘇三國　加嚴封鎖航空資源　防止洩漏提煉汽油技術</h3>
<p>華盛頓　國務院頃發表公報稱、「本院為國家利益計、曾與海陸軍兩部交換意見、當經決定勸告本國廠商、勿以關於提煉上等汽油之圖樣工具、以及其他技術的知識、供給某某國」、此間外交界人士頃談稱、此項措置、適用於日本·德國•蘇聯三國、國務院即當以之通告本國各主要汽油廠、查政府前此原已勸告本國商民、勿以煤油運往各該國、但各該國無小各儲大批煤油、今後倘亦備具提煉上等汽油之知能、則美國商民即使遵照政府勸告、不復以煤油供給各該國、亦殊難發生實效、於以見國務院採取上項決定之用意、端在防微杜漸、務使阻止煤油運往某某國一項辦法、毫無罅隙、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務院昨日將「道義的禁運一飛機輸往轟炸平民之各範圍擴大、包括不出售飛機廠製造權以及出賣高質飛機燃料之技術消息、國務院宣稱、美國各油公司通知政府、彼等不予製造飛機燃料之便利、但對出售飛機上所用汽油並未禁止、（二十一日合衆電）</p>
<h3>美國對華　信用放款　收支賬目公布</h3>

<h3>英泰晤士報論　開放長江</h3>
<p>倫教　此間消息靈通人士、對於日本允開放長江、供各國航行事均表示歡迎、認爲此乃東京政府有一種更建設的政策之明徽、泰晤士報外交訪員聲稱、日人此舉之目的、顯係欲謀日美關係之改善、希望美國務院與之續訂商約、其第二目的、或係欲增進英日之關係、總之、日政府此次發起一種不爲其軍部「前進份子所讚許之政策、實已表現不少之勇氣也、今日泰晤士報並載有社論、謂日本重行開放至南京一段之長江、供各國通航之消息、當然爲一般人所歡迎、此爲上海恢復其貨物集散地貿易之第一直接步驟、惟此舉之眞正效果、恐在實際上未必甚大耳、邇來長江上游之貨物、已多繞道運滬、另加日本商船由長江一帶運下之貨物、上海口岸已漸恢復其活動力、惟南京位於距長江口之百餘哩、該處以下之一段、僅爲長江轉入中國內地之小部分而已、如欲使抵滬之長江航運業有任何重要力量、則實有開放該江至漢口之必要、然此最近之發展、足爲一種有希望之徵象、中國法幣匯率有更堅定之趨勢、可爲一種反映云（二十一路透電）</p>

<p>約塞夫，維塞里翁諾夫維支，斯達林（原姓朱加希維里），於一八七九年十二月二十一日生於蒂弗里省之戈里鎮。其父維薩里翁，朱加希維里，係喬其亞人，原為同省狄地維洛村之農戶，後遷居戈里鎮，改業鞋匠。其母愛卡特林娜，係其農奴之女。</p>
<p>斯達林於一八八八年入戈里之教會學校，一八九四年畢業，考入蒂弗里神學院。十五歲已與俄國秘密革命團體發生關係。一八九七年即為神學院內秘密馬克斯主義團體之領袖。一八九八年八月正式加入俄國社會民主工黨之蒂弗里支部。</p>
<p>列寗之『火花報』於一九〇〇年開始出版時，斯達林即完全接受其立場。一九〇〇年及一九〇一年蒂弗里時時發生罷工風潮，一九〇一年在蒂弗里市中心舉行之非法五一示威運動，即由斯達林組織及領導。其時帝俄政府對於革命運動之發展已深感恐慌，乃加緊從事鎮壓。一九〇一年三月二十二日，芡實曾往斯達林住處搜查。斯氏從此乃被迫避入地下，直至一九一七年二月革命發生時為止。</p>
<p>帝俄政府發覺斯氏為傑出之革命家後，曾盡力加以妨害。一九〇二年至一九一三年間，斯達林曾被捕八次，流徙七次，並從流徙地點潛逃六次，一九〇一年九月，斯氏被舉為社會民主工黨（簡稱社民黨）蒂弗里支部委員。十一月往巴坦市組成當地社民黨支部，領導罷工，並於次年三月組織大規模政治示威運動，本人親自領導游行。一九〇二年四月初次被捕，但在獄內仍與革命運動保持關係，因而得悉布爾雪維克派與孟雪維克派間嚴重分歧，而斯氏則斷然擁護列寗及布爾雪維克派之立場。一九〇三年十一月底，斯氏被判流徙西比利亞東部伊爾庫茨克省之諾伐烏亞達村。一九〇四年一月五日由該村逃出，返抵高加索一帶從事革命工作。一九〇五年十二月充任外高加索區域布爾雪維克派代表，出席在芬蘭坦麥福士舉行之首屆全俄布爾雪維克派會議，即於此會中初次與列寗見面。一九〇六年斯多克荷姆舉行之社民黨四屆代表大會中，斯氏亦甚活動，並與列寗共同為革命發展之中布爾雪維克路綫奮圖。一九〇七年復出倫敦舉行之五屆代表大會，</p>
<p>一九〇七年斯達林開始在巴庫從事革命活動，巴庫為外高加索最大工業城，亦為俄國工人運動重要中心之一。斯氏在該市努力工作一年，使工人大衆均擁護布爾雪維克主義。一九〇八年三月廿五日斯氏二次被捕，囚獄八個月後，判決流徙伏洛達省之蘇維柴戈斯克二年。但一九〇九年六月二十四日即二次逃走，復返巴庫從事非法活動。一九一〇年三月二十三日在巴庫三次被捕，於監禁六個月後，被送回蘇維柴戈斯克。一九一一年夏末秋初三次逃出，改往聖彼得堡，同年九月九日在該市四次被捕，三度流徙伏洛達省，次年一月，社民黨發生重大事變，黨之普拉哈會議開除孟雪維克派，組織布爾雪維克。斯氏缺席當選為黨中央委員，並由列寗推薦被派中央委員會俄國局長。其時斯氏在流徙中，不得不設法其逃走，因此奧卓尼基茲曾奉列寗之名住伏洛達見斯氏授以機宜。斯氏即於一九一二年二月二十九日四次逃走。</p>
<p>是年由斯氏創議，布爾雪維克黨之第一次大衆報紙『真理報』開始於聖彼得堡出版。其第一號係斯氏親自指導編輯，內容曾明白宣佈其政治傾向。</p>
<p>一九二二年四月二十二日，斯氏又在列寗格拉街上被捕。監禁數月，被判流徙納尼孟區城三年。但是年九月一日斯氏即又逃返列寗格拉，在該市編輯『星報』及『真理報』，並指導四屆國會選舉時布爾雪維克派之活動。斯氏曾冒極大危險出席各工廠之緊急會議發表演說，此期內渠與列寗之關係更臻密切。列寗曾親函表示完全贊同斯氏之活動，演說及文字。斯氏曾兩次往克拉哥親訪列寗，並出席會議，而於寄居國外時寫成其史的傑作『馬克斯主義與民族問題』。（未完）</p>

<h3>慈善籃球錦標易主　美得申報杯　中華隊昨晚表演進步可觀　結果三四比六二再度受挫　今晚八時第三次比賽</h3>
<p>第三屆申報盃中美慈善籃球賽、錦標已落美人之手、中華隊自第一戰敗挫後、重整陣容、補充健將、惜乎本屆美國隊之實力、堅强異常、昨晚第二戰、中華隊以以三十四比六十二敗挫、上半時則形勢緊張、堅壁防守、十三比廿五、僅差八分耳、美國隊旣連勝二决、申報杯遂被其奪去、暫時易主原無問題、來年再較量高下、今晚第三戰、雖已無關錦標得失、仍照常舉行、八時起開賽、較昨前改遲一小時、屆時中華隊或將改變戰略、出奇兵以取勝也、</p>
<p>相持不下達兩分鐘</p>
<p>昨美隊最初登塲、仍爲淸一色麥令白隊五將、中華隊之第一陣綫爲祥龍·文奎·南羣··鐘恩·邦珍·中圈跳球、球爲長鹿所獲、迅傳祥龍、立達籃下、不意薩勤脫斜裏穿來、祥龍無功而返、旋王南羣罰球、叉吿失的、中華隊輕輕失去先開紀錄之機會、相持不下者達兩分鐘之久、雙方防守、殊見嚴密、但仍被鮑杜雪擊開紀錄、薩勤脫·柯理司接連命中、六比零佔先、華隊雖先後以大貓少卿調上、替出鐘恩阿奎、陣脚仍見鬆動、致美隊比分、繼續增高、剎那間竟成十三比〇之懸殊局面、直至派司哥犯規、孫惠培罰中一分、始打破沉悶空氣、</p>
<p>空氣緊張黃金時代</p>
<p>中華隊旣見得手、士氣頓時旺盛、少卿一射、王孫兩罰、水到渠成、阿奎冷飯偷得、邦珍南羣更錦上添花、先後增上十三分之多、十四比十九、中華隊急起直追僅差五分、全塲空氣、大爲緊張、此爲昨晚中華隊之最全盛時期、惜乎中華隊不能乘機靑雲直上、許文奎神射不神、失籃達七次之多、少卿南羣、亦疊失必中之機、雖美隊之派司哥已因四犯罰出、神射手亨沙惠茲入巷、但命運與中華正同、失的亦不下十次、致戰局沉滯六七分鐘之久、當前半結束時、美隊廿三、中華十五、比數極近、相差八分耳、</p>
<p>易籃再戰形勢漸非</p>
<p>休息時間、西靑健身會、仍有輕捷美觀之雙槓表演、頗博得熱烈掌聲、易籃再戰、美隊大調生力軍臨陣、卡遜亦在被徵之列、惟因祥龍之嚴密監視、初無建樹、中華隊射籃機會雖多、終因球運未通、以致號稱神射之許文奎、均以毫厘之差而偏失、而美隊之神射手亨沙惠茲、則八面玲瓏、五箭五中、益以勞勃晚旭之兩罰、分數扶搖直上、華隊方面、僅由祥龍阿奎奪得四分、至此成卅八對十九、分數相差一半、</p>
<p>祥龍罰出大勢遂去</p>
<p>中華隊調動頻繁、亦授人以隙、大貓一擲一罰以後、亭惠爾與卡遜兩建大功、柯理司更利用其偉岸之軀幹、一再侵入、四十比二十一、祥龍四次犯規、被罰出塲、中華隊益成頹勢、許文奎曾一度回復其穿楊絕技、於五十四比廿五以後、奇射成功、大貓亦疊增三分、不圖易得易失、美隊一連射入四球、挽救遂成絕望、許文奎輕舒猿臂、連中兩鵠、鐘聲已鳴、中華隊卒以卅叫對六十二、再遭第二度之敗北、</p>

<p>右表分發人數、上海區是除外的、因爲上海報名單迄未寄到、考生志願無從知悉、所以上海區錄取生不能加入分發、同時上海情形特殊、只好另定分發辦法、以右表各項數字來說、依第一志願分發的人數佔二分之一以上、依第二第三志願分發的人數、的各佔八分之一、指派的佔四分之一、指派的原因、就是由於志願太集中、以學校來說、大多數集中於中大及西南聯大等數校、以科別來說、幾全部集中於工科、（詳見後節）志願過於集中、指派人數因之增多、但指派的範圍、我可以鄭重的報吿、都是照前面的標準辦理、而且經過統委會所特組之小組委員會通過的、一〇四八人中有八九五人仍照志願學系分發、不過學校不同罷了、改系分發的懂有一五三人、而且都是性質極相近的學系、於不得已中、仍求適應學生的志願、至於分發生的總數、較各校容量總人數尚差二十餘人、除少數學校外、均尚未足額、這就是因爲科別的關係、文理農商等科志願者太少、而工科各系與政治經濟鐵道管理等系的志願墨生又過多、因此、各校分發的總人數不能足額、茲將錄取分發學生的科別列表如左、（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食　擾讓多時之米市　如今可望漸入正軌　來源被阻聞已在交涉中　囤戶心虛積貨拋售漸多　只要滬市平定產價立跌　卅元一石米價尙有利沾</h3>
<p>米市自經整頓後、茲已漸入正軌、惟尚覺不足者、內地來源仍爲某方所壟斷、轉輸出口、救濟彼國內之米荒、聞向內地採辦之數、首批定爲三百萬石、致半月來滬埠米源、竟至缺乏、所恃巨額洋米、不斷來滬、本埠民食、得告無慮、聞疏通內地來源一帶、已向某方交涉中、諒不日可得要領、又聞調節會尚擬訂購巨額洋米、抑平米價、米市前途、當在最短期間有雲開見日、重覩光明之望也、</p>
<p>無錫等處年歲並不荒歉、半年內决無缺米之虞、上海米商藉口來源稀少、或來源受阻、一似惟有放任漲價、始可有米吃、殊不知產地本無意禁阻、因上海米價漲得太利害、產地米商看得眼紅、紛紛囤購搬運、想大發其財、閙得產地亦上漲不已、乃引起注意加以禁阻、若上海米價能跌至三十元以內、則產地勢必隨而下跌、至相當售價、自可不致禁阻出運、譬如無錫米價十六元、加運輸公司包裝捐運四元、再加雜費四元、到上海成本不過二十四元、賣出三十元、已是極好利息、何必定要一囤再囤、橫漲豎漲、閙成恐慌耶、（人）</p>
<p>昨日本埠米市塲營業已如往日狀態、早市本鄉店胃週前無形停頓數天、亟須添備、客販前者剩貨頗多、亦謀急脫、相互平價售出、囤戶更求卸其肩負、三方同時進出、成交頗夥、結果各貨行情、除西貢米去路最巨稍有上落外、餘若厚薄粳價悉依限價開出、而尤以嚴記等蘇白粳拋出爲多、</p>
<p>客秈到銷兩淡、市面乃被洋米湧到而至落令、江北蕪湖大市貨仍開三十三元限盤、中决別降三五角、惟南京及特高各機釉均少出售、全日交易仍祗數百包而已、</p>
<p>洋米國外定價雖已略爲報低、然一號西貢洋商兜售價仍須四十七元半及四十八元、目下尚難通劃、惟路貨原包略見起色、價自四十二元七角到四十三元、現貨市石三十六元三角至三十五元不等、亦比前日較漲半元左右、因舖銷漸活、作鄉續辦、市乃轉站、全日零整交易亦有三四千包、</p>
<p>無錫通訊、本邑爲產米之區、亦爲米糊集散之所、舉凡江陰·常州•宜興·溧陽等縣外運之米、均在本邑停留、其重要正不亞於蕪湖上海、往年米價、一値出新、常能目動低落、最近數年新米價格、最高不過十元、高低僅五六元、今年則因情形特殊、在此出新之秋、米價不跌反漲、九十月間、新米每石售十八九元、至十十一月間、跌至十六元左右、嗣後即爲湧登之時、方慶可逐步低落、詎意完全相反、竟爲逐步上漲、而達現在二十元之高價、推原其故、要不外米商囤積操縱、居奇抬價所致、而地方不靖、農民感於存儲白米之易招覬覦、故多數尚未甩稻、而採逐漸軋碾糶售之法、如此可减少危險、乃適爲米商利用、造成此决上漲之主要因素、查今年本邑收成、因雨水稍多、低田受損較重、是以參差不一、豐者（高田居多）每畝可收二石八九、歉者（低田居多）僅一石五六、平均約有七成收獲、所謂七成、即係如十足年成、每畝可收白米三石、即俗語「一畝三担」、若七成則爲二石光景耳、向例農民於收稻後、即從事碾糶、冬至前大帮已可完畢、故俗語有「冬至糰子嚐嚐看」之謂、而米價在此時下跌亦最厲、今年因時局關係、不能遵循常軌、致城廂各堆棧存積米穀數量、往年常達一二百萬担者、今則僅有二十餘萬担、存底旣薄、米商自可乘機操縱、關於運輸困難、捐稅繁重等情、雖係事實、但並不若米商口中之嚴重、依吾人所知、除大批米糧或不免發生意外阻碍、對於民船運輸、及較小數目、若手續完備、即亦無甚問題、而此項手續、在業中人、固皆已熟悉、所納捐稅、並無一定規律、大都視情形而定、據販運商云、米每石實際納捐約二角至四角、穀减半、惟征捐處所則頗多、往往有連納數處而始得達者、此次米價上漲最烈時、每石會售二十一元許、若與昔年相較、幾高達三倍、曾禁止輸出、並頒訂限價、始稍平定、（惠）</p>
<h3>小麥廠胃轉懈　粉價已難過好</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨現粉廠盤、二號正牌悉爲八元七角原盤、而本街零批交易、頗見活躍、蓋以米價高貴、需粉較殷、而各廠爲維持本街民食、亦可儘量供給、惟客銷允感平常、據靑島客談、該地去粉每包須虧二元七八角、且油市不振、需要更淡、津帮亦以販運不劃、進胃寥寥、統市成交的叫萬包、除本鄉去化外、南洋帮稍辦而已、日廠粉先疲後緊、十二月份鳳凰牌八元一角四分、一月份八元四角六分至八分、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市先緊後疲、來源略有點綴、而成本高昂、均思善價而沽、惟廠方進胃轉懈、因目下客銷難旺、僅維持本街、粉價又難過好、是以殺價而取、售方則猶在掙扎、結果廠辦祇二千包、最高價仍爲十五元、中决檔已別小、聞各地搬運之貨、不久即可絡繹抵滬、更兼國歷年關將屆、故市面已覺鬆象耳、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油正市果大跌　最多時每担跌二十元</h3>
<p>日久擯持不開之豆油市面、因大跌之情形已行宣露、不振之局、難以挽回、昨日一般囤貨者昆勢難檳持、祇得公開出售、結果除東北桶油無市外、其餘一致做開、正式大盤行情、比較最高紀錄（七日市）暴挫二十元左右、但至午後買氣轉盛、在收盤時已回砌三元、統計成交膠州油一百件、價爲七十一元、靑歧油一百件、價爲七十二元、烟歧油一百五十件、價爲七十三元至七十五元、江北桶油七十六桶、價爲九十六元至一百元、本廠油一千餘担、價爲七十七元、又常州來廠桶油三十九桶、價爲九十七元、</p>
<h3>金融　匯市復入　盤旋狀態</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、已告盤旋狀態、變動不大、先緊而後回、晨開均平、嗣因華商紗花帮等首來買入、且同時華行亦有吃進、再以外行供意淡薄、潛勢即告步緊、迨九時五十分、已縮至四辦士六〇九三七五、及七元五六二五、旋以扒風漸息、爲狀頓形轉定、如是者直至午刻、香港突來電塞、故情况遂稍回平、迄至午收、爲四辦士六五六二五及七元六五六二五、午後狀態平靜、毫無生色、結果晚收仍與午收相仿、較上日各緊〇三一二五、期貨趨勢、與現貨無別、惟本月份因交割將屆、已見軋平、</p>
<p>紗花帮尙有結進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均縮〇六二五、紐約銀價長一分、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美對法均平、對滬小〇六二五、美對英滬法等各滙俱平、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士六八七五、美滙七元六八七五、較前收均無榮辱、開後華商紗花帮等首來扒結、同時華行亦稍吃進、但因外銀行供意不濃、致潛勢即見步緊、迨至九時三刻、英金已縮至叫辦士六〇九三七五、美滙亦軟達七元五六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小〇•二五、此後扒者漸少、情况轉平、將至午刻、港電突來供塞、故遂稍回平、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士六五六二五、美滙七元六五六二五、比晨開各微緊〇三一二五、</p>
<p>午後市况頗岑寂</p>
<p>後市狀態沉悶之至、情勢初時靜中略現鬆態、英金四辦士六五六二五及美滙七元六八七五、一度可結、後投機商稍扒遠期、曾轉微緊、入後華行略來售出、遂告回平、迄至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士六五六二五、美滙七元六五六二五、本月份與現貨相同、正月份英金四辦士六二五、美滙七元五三一二五、結果比上日、現貨英美滙各緊〇三一二五、本月份央緊〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、正月份結果與現貨相埒、</p>
<p>香港匯市無上落</p>
<p>香港二十一日電、今晨滙市開盤穩定、各滙與昨日午收比較均無上落、十時五十分申滙現貨升二元、爲三百二十元、十一時三十分無榮辱、下午二時三十分開盤、亦無上落、</p>
<p>天津英美仍見緊</p>
<p>天津二十一日電、今晨滙市開盤告平、英滙現貨縮〇六二五、爲四便士四三七五、美滙現貨緊一二五、爲七元二五、申滙降半元、爲一百〇五元、「聯鈔」暗盤昂七角半、爲九十三元、</p>
<h3>金號套賣　雖漲仍微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、以匯市穩中略告軟化、故大買戶港帮逢賤搜購、但於優良之環境中、受某余號極力套賣、（乃結進外滙遠期套出烚赤）高價始終難久、而結果尚能軋漲十六元、至當日過程、初開告漲二十六元、爲四千一百七十元、原因外匯報緊、某錢兌業首買、惟匯市仍報緊軟、加以港帮委某錢兌業在拖、遂被拉高達四千一百八十五元頂價、旋以匯市轉平、買風不繼、金號銀樓帮互相塞出、又回挫、及至午刻、再以匯市報硬、且某銀號代客力售、遂於收盤前現四千一百四十九元低價、幸港帮見低又撈、故午收尚有四千一百五十八元、午後首開續高、不久金號拋出、而某錢兌業再進、故結果晚收爲四千一百六十元、全天交易約一千六百兩光景、銀樓飾金無變、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤依然上漲</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開匯市報軟、金號錢兌業等競買、開市即抬起二十六元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百七十元、開後雖證劵帮亦來跟進、但因銀樓帮現金號等　套賣頗力、不久回落十五元、錢兌業吐予證券帮二十兩、爲四千一百五十五元、此後終因外滙仍走緊勢、加以某錢兌業力代港帮收買、且賣方供意轉淡、復漲三十元、某錢兌業進同業三十兩、爲四千一百八十五元、嗣因外匯轉平、港帮停扒、證券帮等遂獲利復出、又回撳二十七元、金號出錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百五十八元、其時港帮忽限價重進、未幾又拉起十二元、錢兌業進證券帮十兩、爲四千一百七十元、旋以買風漸息、且銀樓帮頻來塞出、市勢又緩緩向下、不久再以外滙突報回硬、某銀號代客力售百餘兩、遂撳小至四千一百四十九元、將近收盤時、某錢兌業又趁低在拖、遂提高九元、進金號一十兩、爲四千一百五十八元作午收價、午後首先開做七元、某錢兌業進金號十兩、爲四千一百六十五元、後某金號繼續塞出、一時進者觀望、步小十五元、金號吐予錢兌業二兩、爲四千一百五十元、入後某錢兌業見低又扒、且證券帮亦稍跟買、高達四千一百六十五元、後進者止扒、遂降落五元、金號售予銀樓帮十兩、爲四千一百六十元作晚收價、結果照上日續漲十六元、全天三十六元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照赤烚較高數元、收進减小二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未更、大同行仍懸四百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　市塲仍少興奮</h3>
<p>證券惜槃、趨勢繼續趨疲、市塲謠言政府擬發行外滙劵八萬萬元、人心因此又見恍惚、漲風初起遭此挫折、自屬又難振作、前波未平後波又起、昨初開先堅後疲、未出舊軌、益昌賣出絞湧買進多屬零星散戶、甲種因賣戶獨多、午後跌落亦較鉅、午後二十號收進中種竟又回好三角、餘則平平、結果仍一致續小五分一角左右、成交總數的五十五元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交至中銀行股二十股、價爲每股）百元、正與票面値相等、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、潛勢復告回堅、成交數額仍少、興趣亦無專注之點、實業股岑寂穩定、橡皮股雖生橡皮價格跌落、走勢毫不覺軟、蓋有不少穩健投資者、參與買方活動也、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、海關稅祖保債券上升一二鎊、計善後借款（英發）升二鎊、價爲三十五鎊、、英德續借款（英發）升一鎊、價爲五十六鎊、其餘平平、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、祗保安保險股上升半鎊、價爲二十三鎊半、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>紗花　逢低不管乏拖進　紗市回升　雙馬漲十元</h3>
<p>連疲兩日之紗市、昨則又復趨升回蘇、雖海外棉市依然在下風中、而本埠同業目光一致不看小、逢低落時拖進心思、殊爲濃密、因傳天津有交易所成立、於是對於二十支紗收進者又不乏人、又有一部份云、謂匯票改縮、望漲收進、但實際消化、除三二支•四二支外、其他沉寂如恒、目前大致情况、還係價格連跌幾天、有人進則上、行盤高漲後獲利者一吐、即回挫下墜矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因美棉連跌、遠期打破一角關口、人氣尚平、二十支雙馬價爲七百二十元、與上日不相上下、惟大戶多頭復來加碼、少頃外匯又見微縮、買風頓起、檯面允覺乾枯、市價乃步步上升、做至七百三十一元半收盤、查半日成交統計一千九百六十五元、行情二十支雙馬漲十元、雙地球漲八元、天女漲八元、中紡廠開出十支金寳星三百包、價爲五百四十五元、二十支金寳星二百包、價爲六百七十五元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、同行一、五〇〇香港　四一五內地　五〇統計一、九六五</p>
<h3>廠方停辦　棉價再降</h3>
<p>本棉交易依然靜寂、同行冒賣寥若晨星、廠方亦停頓不辦、所以棉花市面益覺晴澹而無生色、市價續趨下風、加以海外印美棉市一致下降、人心又受打擊、蘇北來源、計通花一千二百三十五包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>火機　一五五·〇〇　同行進二〇〇包</p>
<p>草包　一五三·〇〇　又　六〇〇包</p>
<p>又　一五五·〇〇　又　一一〇包</p>
<p>又　一五四·〇〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>巴西棉二四〇·〇〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來頗呈疲乏之狀、蓋因聖誕節轉瞬即屆、各交易者巳無意營業、况前做之交易早已獲厚利、故紛紛作獲利了結之舉、乘機拿取利潤、消度歲尾、棉價因是項賣出者衆多、故咋日收盤價格較之上日又跌、近期降落六•七磅音、遠期跌二十磅音、印度連同預測跌十羅比、埃及跌六七十磅音、利物浦跌二十便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉、同業前做之紐約交易所期貨交易、日來亦仿歐美作風、紛紛獲利了結、前昨二日、了結者已有近萬包之多矣、現貨交易、因陽歷年關將屆、各方靜寂異常、俱無進出聞、茲將昨日棉市以美匯七元六八七五折合送廠價如下、二十支　美米特林　二三四·四〇</p>
<p>又　下級　二二九·一〇</p>
<p>三十二支　二四〇·三五</p>
<p>又　下級　二三四·三〇</p>
<p>四十二支　二四三·八〇</p>
<p>又　下級　二三八·〇〇</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口粉回跌</h3>

<h3>糖市　交易轉靜</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢較靜、無甚變更、公會劃盤二四粗白、本棧五十九元四角、外棧五十九元七角、至五角、轉口貨呌四十八元、太古車白B嘜六十元至五十九元半、DY嘜五十八元半、HX嘜五十八元、H嘜車赤四十五兀、荷赤MP嘜四十六元半、WA嘜四十六元、本綿白等無上落、國糖僅開出興化京赤數十包、四十一元四角、</p>
<h3>海味　麒菜欣欣向榮</h3>
<p>麒菜近以底存單薄、市勢乃日見向榮、刻市獅毛菜售五十一元、冲貨四十六元、西蘭菜四十四元、龍牙菜四十二元、武敦菜四十二元、銷路不寂頗形挺秀、</p>
<h3>安南尾有續到</h3>
<p>安南蝦尾、前昨續有運到、計田蝦三十四箱、田扁尾十箱、冲東尾十箱、成本與前彷彿、小日即將開售、但據一般人推測、以底碼過昂、苟杳港來源一湧、後市須稍防低落、</p>
<h3>魚皮魚肚　到稀價穩</h3>
<p>魚皮魚肚到源稀少、邇來各帮採辦殊殷、市勢堪稱堅穩、如白魚皮已售二百三十元、公魚皮高檔爲一百五十元、共决一百二十元、單片肚爲二百五十元、搭片二百三十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　摒棄不必要消耗　火爐煤銷路清</h3>
<p>鴻基火爐白煤、連日頻漲以來、終因時處非常、米珠薪桂、生計大難、對此不必要之消耗、多數節的、摒棄不用、因是銷路平淡、漸入呆滯之途、但市盤以成本攸關、一意堅持、同業折價、鴻基白煤每噸一百二十元門莊發客、篩塊一百二十八元、提塊一百三十二元、小子一百二十四元、送到客戶、不取車力、</p>

<h3>越界築路交涉　尙未臻接近階段　局方意旨堅決拒絕對策　偽府或於下週提出答覆</h3>
<p>關於越界築路交涉、工部局於十九日對僞市府提出之復文、內容係拒絕偽方之要求、昨日續從各方面探訪所知、局方除拒絕僞市府十一月十一日「對案一所提各項要求外、仍留有讓步餘地、俾此項談判、得以繼績進行、</p>
<p>本案發動形勢甚緊</p>
<p>按、越界築路之糾紛、於本年秋間達於極端、僞市府得日方支持、堅持所謂「全面的」接收越界築路、旋於十月下旬、經領袖領事納羅尼中校居間斡旋、雙方進行談判、由工部局先行起草建議方案、以作討論根據、局方建議方案、於十一月二日送達偽市長、方案內容、雙方均拒不發表、</p>
<p>局方最初建議內容</p>
<p>茲從各方面探詢、始悉關於捐稅一項、工部局之建議、爲另設一特別機關、征收越界築路之捐稅、並另列特別會計、至該捐稅機關職員、由租界當局與僞市府兩方面派員担任、至該區之警權、亦採相同辦法、由雙方派警、共同駐防及巡邏、</p>
<p>偽府對案已予拒絕</p>
<p>上項建議方案、由傳筱庵於十一月十一日提覆「對案」、內容除對工部局之建議附加意見外、並有其他僞方單獨提出之條伴、此項要求、經工部局審愼考慮後、決予拒絕、遂草成覆文、而於本月十九日由工部局總董樊克令賣帶、於訪傳筱庵時面交、此項拒絕覆文、尙留有廣大之討論餘地、據信僞市長或當於下週內再作答覆、</p>
<p>今後局勢尙待發展</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、某晨報傳工部局已拒絕「市長」傅筱庵所提越界築路之對案、工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥今（二十一日）晨加以否認、據稱、「此說完全不確、但費氏拒不披露星期二日夜交出的工部局覆文之性質、而局方覆文、是否含有對傳氏對案、作任何修改、或以新建議作補充、費氏亦不說明、記者問渠是否以爲工部局與「市府」間之越界築路談判、不久當可獲解決、費氏聲稱、渠希望如此、如其他許多人然、</p>
<h3>煤球又漲價</h3>
<p>上海市煤球業同業公會於前日下午召開各廠代表聯席會議、主席陳萃芳、議決結果、僉以煤屑來價趨漲、成本增加、自本月二十一日起、（一）每噸批發七十五元、外加車費二元、（二）門售每担（一百市斤）四元二角、聞義泰興每担仍開價四元、</p>
<h3>中農新輔幣券　將運滬五十萬　中行角票運滬確數十萬　三批分券將到核發從嚴　法幣携滬每人限二百元</h3>
<p>財政部爲救消滬市分鞘券輔鞘券一元券缺乏恐慌、已核准中央銀行印製分幣券、及已印之輔幣券酌量發行、並請四行聯合辦事總處、轉飭各行速向滬市酌運一元券以資調劑、個人携帶法幣來滬、仍嚴格限制、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>角票</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向中央銀行探悉、（一）分幣券二批五十萬元行將發竣、三批五分券五十萬元、決與二批銜接發行、惟爲防止流入淪陷區域及儲藏牟利起見、採用逐漸發行制度、對請求者從嚴核發、（二）一元券匯豐中央等行已有大批運到、經中央銀行發兌、每人暫限二十元、今市上已普及流通、（三）輔幣券前日確有十萬元、（係中央銀行之一角二角券）、由英商滙豐銀行運至上海、外傳由昌興公司俄羅斯皇后號運滬二百萬元之說、據查該輪係本月十七日抵滬、並未裝有輔幣券來滬、所以報載中行今日發兌之說絕對不確、但中國農民銀行確有五十萬元新輔幣券、將由港裝外輪運滬、惟起運日期尙未得電報、</p>
<p>分券</p>
<p>上海市商會以先後據綢緞　酒菜館業等公會函請轉函中央銀行上海分行、准由各業公會代領分幣券、懇酌予撥發等情去後、茲接中央銀行復函云、查本行此决續發分券、並未在各日報登載任何公吿、惟在發行以前、曾由各業公會來函、申請登記、當以發行數目有限、而所請登記之數則殊鉅、分配爲難、經覆容屆時酌量撥兌、所謂酌量撥兌、固未指定由各公會代領兌換、矧自發兌以來、各商號自來申請兌換者幾戶限爲穿、業由本行依决分別核覆、並由各該商號依照規定日期、兌換數目、遂漸來行兌訖、如再由各業公會代領整數、兌給同業會員、則不但事屬重複、即本行亦無鉅量分券、可以應付、尙請貴會轉覆各該會轉知各會員商店、仍分別來函申請兌換、並塡明數目、再由本行核定函復、總之、本行有券可兌、無不酌量照兌也、</p>
<p>法幣</p>
<p>財政剖爲防止法幣流入淪陷區域、特規定「凡由浙江之溫州·寗波·福建之福州·以及上列各埠附近設有海關分卡之地方、每人携帶法幣出口前往上海者、槪以二百元爲限、逾限將超過限額部份沒收充公、以資制止、其必需携帶限額以上款項者、應向就近銀行滙兌」、業已電令浙閩海關遵照辦理、又錄浙海關監督暨稅務司之會銜佈吿如下、「查限制旅客由各口岸携帶鈔票出口、每人不得超過五百元、逾限即予沒收一案、疊經本關第八九號及第九二號佈吿週知各在案、茲續奉財政部電令節開（見前從略）等因、奉此、自應遵照辦理、至旅客由浙閩口岸携帶外國鈔票前住上海、仍照以前規定、每人不得超過英金三十鎊、美金一百五十元、或具同等價値之他國貨幣、但如旅客所携雜有中外鈔票、則所帶中國鈔票部份、應不得超過國幣二百元之數、除分行外、合亟佈吿、仰各商人等一體知悉、此佈、</p>
<h3>各界將熱烈紀念　民族復興節　雲南肇和紀念同時舉行　節省糜費印售紀念書籤</h3>
<p>十二月二十五日爲雲南起義紀念、又爲民族復興節、滬市各界是日將有熱烈紀念、惟不尙形式、各界並以二期抗戰、日臻有利階段、決恪盡本位責任、期速完成民族復興大業、十二月五日肇和起義紀念、合併於是日舉行、銀錢業循例休假、是日又爲耶穌聖誕、各界推行節的節禮、移助難胞、惟各界爲節省糜費、革除舊習、擬於民族復興節、印售復興節紀念書籤、以替代賀年片、該項書籤聞有五種、印有總裁肖像、並錄有總裁箴言、設計甚爲精緻、定價每種一角、並擬於集有成數後、將該款舉辦公衆慈善事業、</p>
<h3>荳腐店復業　今晨實行漲價</h3>
<p>兩租界荳腐店、自十九日起、突全體停業、整頓市價後、該業除已將新訂市價單、分發各同業及攤担商販外、並已通告自昨晚起、先行恢復製造工作、今（二十二）日晨起、全體復業、至新市價對荳腐之售價、已悉改爲分幣計算、並至少以五分起碼、致平民之普通佐膳食品、顯然開支增加矣、</p>
<h3>兩租界各米店　昨已照常營業　少數米店尙未全部開市　洋米籌碼大增市况穩定</h3>
<p>滬西舉辦平糶</p>
<p>滬米市自經兩租界當局與米業團體採取緊急措置、嚴禁投機操縱後、米價已趨穩定、各米商因國米來源欠暢旺、而洋米又見鬆動、故紛紛訂購洋米、以致洋米籌碼大增、米店昨恢復營業、滬西辦平糶、</p>
<p>各米店昨恢復營業</p>
<p>全市千餘家米店號家、前因搶米風熾、閉門營業後、現因米價逐漸下降、搶米風潮巳戢止、兩租界當命米號公會通知各米店恢復營業、故昨日各米號大部已照常開門應市、其店址在邊區如海格路等處、易滋事端者、由巡捕隨時注意、常川駐守、以防不虞、</p>
<p>滬西昨已舉辦平糶</p>
<p>滬西方面平民較多、米價雖已再度抑低限價、而大衆經濟狀况、仍難應付、際此嚴冬、誠恐爲生活所逼、走入歧路、雖搶米風潮已加壓止、但未能根本解除恐慌、殊於地安寗有碍、聞愚園路憶定盤路轉角、昨有平糶米出售、因人數擁擠、捕房特派鐵甲車駐守、並派捕二十餘人防護、僞警方面、亦崗一二十名、在該處守望、</p>
<p>訂購洋米籌碼大增</p>

<h3>關於增加學費</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>為了百物的高貴，開支增加，上海的私立學校，自本年度下學期起有的曾增加過一次學費。但近幾月來，物價的上漲，依然漫無限制，使各學校的開支，又超過預算。在這種情形之下，據說有很多私立學校，一待寒假結束，明正開學，又要把學費增加了。學校在這物價猛漲聲中，為了開支浩大，要增加學費，我們自未可厚非。不過我們另一面，却不能不顧到家長方面，是否能再加重子弟讀書的負擔。</p>
<p>平心而論，上海有很多私立學校，所收的學費已不好算低，就是不加，在今日的情形之下，一般做家長者，也將不勝負擔了，何况加了再加，這是迫使在學的兒童也要中途輟學哩！都市中的薪給階級，每月收入超過百元的，試問有多少？百元以下的在今日情形之下，試問又是否能留出一部作子女的學費？明知子女到了學齡時節，應使他們讀書，但沒有錢可不能進學校，衹有坐看子女的失學了。爲學費增加，而使失學兒童的數字增高，這不是辦敎育者的本旨吧？</p>
<p>在這裏，我們並不說不同情學費增加而使校長負債，我們所希望的，就在全市辦敎育的都能爲敎育而辦敎育，對於增加學費一問題，各校都要按照自己的經濟情形，加以考慮。能不加最好，就是加，也應照最低限度，任何人都知道「八一三」之後，上海有許多私立學校，的確是多了些錢，辦學校不比做賣買一定要天天賺錢，年年上袋，而把學費拼命的漲上去。</p>
<p>至於有的學校，就是不加，也能維持得下，那再要想增加學費，更是不近情理。要知發財不在這時候，尤其辦學校而想發財，更是不當。總之，權衡輕重，一方面節省無謂的開支，眞是萬不得已而要加費，也應適可而止，這原是苦難的時代！吾則，無非使上海的敎育，蹈上滅亡的路徑而已！</p>
<h3>對話</h3>
<p>— 張鳳儀</p>
<p>小學生：「先生。米蛀蟲是屬於那一類的動物。」</p>
<p>敎師：「米蛀蟲屬於爬蟲類。是冷血的動物。也是害蟲的一種。」</p>
<p>小學生：「那麼爲甚麼我家隔壁一家米店裏的老闆。人家也都呌他米蛀蟲呢。」</p>
<p>敎師：「哦…………」</p>
<h3>怪烏歟？黑蟲歟—原來是野鴨？</h3>
<p>— 生</p>
<p>據十四日本埠報載十一日淸晨六時許，本市會有似鴻似雁之鳥類數千萬頭飛過，惟據昨日來自虹口者談，謂是晨虹口曾見有黑色飛蟲數百萬頭，結合成羣，似黑雲一團，面積的二十餘丈，飛過虹口，不知去向，但亦無人能知此項黑蟲究爲何物云云。余昨據金山來客談，則足以辨證所謂似黑雲一團者，是驚而非黑蟲，而其爲害田禾，可爲數百年來駭人聽聞之事，爰記之如左：</p>
<p>昨據金山來客談云：十日晚間，某處鄉人方擁被而臥，驟聞大聲來自西北，如風雨之暴至，崩騰澎湃，有排山倒海之勢。鄉人以大風猝至，是天將驟冷之徵，不以爲異。决晨啟門視察，則大爲驚駭，蓋數十畝稻穀，完全盡失，時禾稻雖已刈下，尚在田中，不知被人竊去，抑爲何種動物所食，均不可知。惟被人竊去，則決無若是之凈盡也。於是失稻者莫不痛哭流涕，而未被損失者，則方慶幸其獲免。</p>
<p>不料是夜，大風又起，鄉人大驚，方方數十里內之鄉人，莫不持竿携挺而起，則見田畝中盡是野鴨，不下數千萬頭，蠢蠢而動。鄉人以挺擊之，亦不飛去，僅作唔唔之聲，稍避鄉人之棒擊而已。久之有一騖起飛，於是羣飛而去，似有領導者然。事後鄉人逋獲是鶩，有已被擊傷者，有未被擊傷者，不下數百頭。而次夜所被損害之區，比前夜所食者較爲廣大，蓋不下百餘畝也。市人見者，購其一頭，烹而食之，則與市上所購之野鴨，完全無異。第三夜鄉人持挺以待，則絕跡不至矣。</p>
<p>野鴨傷書田稻，爲數千年來罕聞之事。惟據人云：此種野鴨，大的來自太湖，因太湖中恒有獵人前往獵鶩，冬令尤多，以資生活。自戰事發生後，獵人不敢前往，而此種野鴨，生育頗繁，近因生產過剩，大肆其殖民政策，於是而爲害禾稼矣。</p>
<p>惟余有疑點數處：（一）太湖野鴨，由來已久，從未聞妨及田禾，即西湖等處，亦有此物，亦未聞有損及田禾之事，何以此决損害田禾如此之甚，其可疑者一也。（二）野鴨傷稻，旣所罕聞，即使有之，何以並不傷及就近田畝之稻，乃高飛數百里外，而塲及金山之禾，其可疑者二也。（三）野鴨是否團體動物，假定一騖未飛，即被捧擊，寗死不去，其可疑者三也。此决野鴨傷稻，實爲未有之奇聞，今　書此，以供科學家之研究焉。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十九回　看花賞月活動成家　種玉孕珠娠姙有術</p>
<p>如今且講到這蜜月旅行，余澹雲的意思，最好休息幾天，不作任何旅行。或有機會，索性到明年春間，告一個假，夫婦作國外旅行，倘能環行全球一周，看看世界的新進步，那是最好。但這一筆費用較大，不如兩人從現在先儲蓄起來，倘有不足時，再和蘇理雅太太相商。她就打了這個主意，好在林建成對於金澹雲惟命是從。她高興旅行，他自然陪伴着她一同去。她不高興旅行，他也不逼迫着她，一定要去。不過蘇理雅太太所辦的製造汽車公司裏，已製造了幾種供家庭旅行之用的汽車，在余澹雲的新婚旅行裏，預備試用。以前蘇理雅太太，原想特製一輛家這庭汽車，贈送給他們新夫婦的，也是金澹雲謝絕不要。她說：『他們夫婦，各有職業，而且各事其事，那有功夫，作旅行之舉。若說新婚旅行，也不過在蜜月中，作一度旅行罷了。此後那輛汽車，擱置不用，未免可惜。』爲着感謝蘇瑯雅太太盛意起見，願意在新婚以後，借着道種新製的家庭旅行車，到各處去游覽一次。這種家庭旅行車，新製成的有三種式樣。前幾天，蘇理雅太太敎人開來，聽憑金澹雲選擇。金滬雲說：「旣然是試車，我們把三種車子都試試好了。』那種家庭旅行車，設備倒也完備。汽車中一樣有精緻的電燈，也裝着無綫電收音機，可以收聽各處的新聞昔樂。它裏面有折疊的鴛鴦牀，這牀是可分可合，最合新婚夫婦之用。機括一紐，摺疊起來，便立刻變成一間起居室，而鴛鴦牀也便成爲沙發椅干了。車子的後面，有一個小廚房，裝有電氣爐，只要備好了魚肉蔬果，自己也可以烹調。小廚房裏還配置有電氣冰箱等，雖在暑天，要吃些冰風雪梨，喝些冰汽水，也很爲便當。雖然是個小廚房，可以備乘客三四人的飲食。除了小廚房之外，還有一間盥洗室，也有水管，通到車頂上，車頂上却裝了一具水箱。因爲現在中國，各處都設有自來水管，而各公路上，也到處都設有水塔，水的取用，也很爲便利。因此這盥洗室內，也裝置了個浴盆，這浴盆是用皮製的，不用時，也可以摺疊起來，甚爲巧妙無比。</p>

<h3>聖誕之什（街頭偶拾）</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>夜落下來了，而燈火明亮如畫。拖着沉重的步子，我蹀　於街頭，遲緩似困於籠中的野獸。</p>
<p>熱閙，擁擠的櫥窗爭着朝我有所訴說，像是賣弄各自的匠心。但，倘用薛術的眼光來評價，是多麼的粗俗，拙劣啊！濃裝艷抹的肥胖的村婦。其實，還不仍是那一點花樣景：「聖誕禮品」。</p>
<p>罩在這同一塊藍色天空下的居民們，却一天天地奔向兩個極端：荒淫奢侈是一個世界，貧困凍飢又是一個世界。瞧着店中來往如　的顧客；你眞不會相信就在同一個日子，在不同的角落裏發生了三十多起搶米案。</p>
<p>酒店的門口高貴的紳士，雍容的淑女跨了出來；憔悴，襤褸的流浪人仲出狗爪般的黑手。輕蔑回答了哀求。消失在夜風中的是飽呃和飢號。</p>
<p>有和藹笑容的，白髮蒼蒼的老人和披戴着雪花的樹木，是聖誕節所不可缺少的點綴。這大約是和平，愉快的象徵吧？一入眼簾就使你不自禁的有一種喜悅的感覺。本來嗎，誰不愛好那一份美麗與潔淨的畫面呢？</p>
<p>可是，在這連和平女神都哭了的年頭，我頗懷疑聖誕老人還能强顏歡笑。看見這慕人類的大悲劇，老人能不哀痛的一哭嗎？况且，什麼地方還有那樣恬靜的園林呢？是血腥的年代呵！</p>
<p>另一種應時的玩意兒也在我面前路幌起來了；賀卡不同的顏色，不同的畫樣，不同的形式，一櫉窗。是用來恭祝友朋得到幸福的。這存心自然很好，可惜太不公允。那一紙代價可以維持另一夥人幾日的生活呢！而且，幸福大都從拿着賀卡的人手指上溜走了。</p>
<p>櫉窗仍在賣弄風姿，然而，我却沒有了閒步的興緻。</p>
<h3>耶穌降生與社會</h3>
<p>（三）使憂傷者得安慰？耶穌聖誕，是永遠快樂的表現，天使的歌聲，是何等的歡騰，所傳報的喜信，是何等的高興，這都是象徵世界昇平，所謂堯天舜日之期將要來到，即所謂「天國近了」，那一般在貧中，病中，獄中的民眾，聽見此音，莫不欣喜若狂，引頸熱望，預備歡迎這大禧年之來臨，耶穌說：「不要懼怕」「不要憂愁」我賜以平安，乃我自己的平安，使你們的喜樂可以滿足，以迄永遠」，因此每年聖誕節，一般基督徒，總是踴躍奔騰，且極力設法使憂愁的人得着普天同慶的快樂。（四）使黑暗者得光明？凡居住幽暗死地之民，必見眞光之照臨，引他們在光天化日之下，耶穌說我來世，是世界之光，跟從我者，不居於暗，必要得着生命的光，耶穌開了瞎子的眼，徵騐祂卽生命之光。眞理是光，天良是眼，天良昏昧，眞理不明，是莫大的黑暗，心地人格，必定墮落，造成黑暗的世界，浮亂暗殺，奸惡欺騙，掠搶勒索，壓制，貪汚，侵略，迷信，等等都是由人心的黑暗所產生的惡果，試看戰爭的結果如何？戰神所給與人們的禮物是什麼？豈筆墨所能形容，難得耶穌的眞光，强烈地普照，破除黑暗的勢力，重見天國的眞光。（待續）如欲詳細詢問請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>歌塲摭舊錄</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>清末公責人，嗜戲成癖，而那拉后更有戲迷之稱，內庭絃歌無虛日，復令巧匠創作種種脗合劇情之佈景，以調劑舞台背景之單調，自後佈景戲始盛行於各戲院。考佈景戲明時已有之，如張岱「陶廣庵憶」劉暉吉女戲篇云：「劉暉吉，奇情幻想，欲補梨園之缺陷，如唐明皇遊月宮，葉法善作法時，塲上一時黑戲地暗，手起劍落，霹靂一聲，黑幔忽收，露出一月，其圓如規，四下以羊角染五色雲氣，中坐嫦娥，桂樹吳剛，白兎搗藥，輕紗之內，燃月明數株，光燄靑藜，色如初曙，攝布成梁，遂躡月窟，境界神奇，忘其爲戲也。」是可見明時佈景戲，已頗能匠心獨運，今日海派本戲，類以佈景新奇爲能事，當以此爲濫觴。</p>
<p>坤伶中武材難得，此爲天賦所限，自亦無可如何事，然當淸末坤伶初發皇時，生旦凈丑，固無不有嬰嬰宛宛者流，與鬚眉爭一席地也•武生如陳家班之陳長庚，演長板坡、界牌關、四杰村、落馬湖等，無論長靠短打，俱極身手靈敏，津滬漢粵，所至有聲。又有雲金紅者，能劇亦多，跌打顚撲，無不窮其所妙，且嗓音嘹亮可聽，不惟南班中所僅見，即北派中武生，亦堪稱矯矯者也。光緒末年，京師劇塲中有周福保者，以演孫行者戲著稱，能在鐵桿上連翻觔斗數十餘，能於舞台中作旋子六七十，面不紅，氣不促，初不知其爲巾幗女兒也。至如鬚生，則有恩曉峰，陳蕙峰，調高響逸，字正腔圓，無論唱做，俱有典則。凈則有金處，以黑頭鳴於世，歌喉洪亮，幾欲奪秀山之席，一聲雷唱探陰山二進宮，亦均有獨到處。丑則有謝少蘭，雖非丑角正宗，而語言拙直，面目可憎，一種形態，輙令人發噱，亦頗能號召一時。至於今日，則舍旦行而外，幾無不有材難之歎，遑論武工。即如孟小冬以鬚生馳名伶苑，人亦媲美叔岩，幾如鳳毛麟角矣！</p>
<p>幼時觀木人頭戲，（即提綫傀儡戲）殊覺賣藝者之巧思爲不可及，演時，賣藝者於幕中牽綫說唱，而台上傀儡，則動作姿態，若合符節，亦居然歌喉宛轉，笙簧並奏，恍如置身於歌舞塲中，近年來已漸不多覯，業此者多半爲落魄伶人，故所演諸戲，無不情景這眞，此輩當其置身於紅氍毺上，粉墨登塲時，何嘗不能號召一時，迨至人老珠黃，不免藉傀儡以餬口，亦云慘矣！明末周亮工與何决德書云：「幼時曾見傀儡戲，二尺許長，綫索累累，任人提弄，近則變爲數寸許，以木板推之，全似自用聰明者，嗟夫！傀儡亦且漸小，亦不由人綫索，而欲自運聰明，可畏亦可悲矣！」撫今思昔，不禁感慨系之！</p>
<h3>閑話耶誕與游藝界</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>耶誕節叉將來到。在歐美各國，每逢此節，差不多無論男女老小，都得熱鬧」番，什麼影戲館咧，跳舞塲咧，夜總會咧，莫不客滿，嚷著，呌着，吃着，玩着，他們幾乎將一年來所遭遇到的種種煩惱與不樂意……，統統都丟在腦後了。</p>
<p>的確，耶誕是離不了游藝的。你瞧，事實上，正有無數的藝人，他們爲了「耶誕」而發了狂，他們都高興着將這個狂歡節，點綴得轟轟烈烈地與新年一樣。</p>
<p>電影院在耶誕節上開映的影片，大部份是最好的，不是塲而偉大或情節曲折，就是屬於輕鬆愉快的。爲了要容納過多的觀衆的緣故，它們都凖備在早上或晚上十一時加映一塲，有的，還特地選了幾張名貴的，五彩的短片，加在正片前放映。在好萊塢影城中，當然啦，情况是更加熱鬧了，送禮，寄耶誕賀片，聚飱設宴……等等，眞是所謂「城開不夜」，熱鬧得無以復加。</p>
<p>其次，挺熱鬧的就要算是跳舞塲了。幾乎每一家都是通宵營業，它們還特地預備了各種新奇的游藝節目，在耶誕節上演之外，更有什麼「耶誕人菜」咧，「耶誕白帽蛋糕咧……每一種東西，都因爲「耶誕」的緣故，而有了一種新的氣象。舞廳內部，都佈置得花花綠綠，舞女們也都準備好了新行頭，燙好了髮，預備在「耶誕」到來的時候，出一次風頭。因此，「耶誕」在跳舞塲中，眞不知有多少錢耗費呢。</p>
<p>上海游藝界自然也不會例外，在「耶誕」它們會更活躍起來，大事準備，趕生意賺錢，無論是戲館，舞塲，播音界……莫不是爭先恐後地在凖備着「耶誕」的特別節目，這秤節目務須是最好的，最能够引起人們的注意力的。</p>
<p>「耶誕」是一個狂歡節，我們如果能够細心計算計算那天所消耗的金錢的話，那未，我們定會發現：這個數目是如何地驚人啊！</p>
<p>「救國不忘娛樂，娛樂不忘救國！」這兩句話雖然是有些陳舊了，但在目前，我想大家有切實奉行的必要，娛樂，在某方面說來，固然也是非常重要的，但是無論如何，在此時此地的上海的市民，每一個人總不該浪費太多的錢在所謂「在歡」上面。我們在娛樂的時候，正該想一想在前綫抗戰的英勇的將士與流浪在街頭的無衣無食的難胞們，因而省下些錢來充作寒衣代金，做些好事，那末，這樣地來過「耶誕」，就更覺得有意義了。</p>
<h3>微速度顯微鏡影片　—為敎育電影的利器—</h3>
<p>— 嚴成熙</p>
<p>美國紐約大學實騐室最近利用微速度顯微鏡攝影，將開麥拉置於顯微鏡前攝取影片。其裝置殊爲精巧，能使十分緩慢之動作，急速地表示出來，於癌及其他恐佈疾病之研究，有極大的助力。例如花開的過程，植物生長狀態，病原菌的活動等都能攝取。該大學羅伯特張伯斯博士等曾應用其技術於短時間內表示微生物及人體組織之緩慢展開，攝成影片。使肉眼所不能見的微生物活動，通常須數日或數周間所起的變化，在數分鐘內即能表現，對於敎宥上的貢獻很大。我國政府年來有敎育電影的攝製，如能研究精進，利用此法，裨益敎育，當非淺鮮。</p>

<h3>小孤雁</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>描寫土人的愚蠢，卑汚，殘酷，蠻橫的電影，我們實在看過太多了；而白種人的軍隊，又怎樣英勇地擊敗了他們，也是千篇一律，得到的結論是：這種愚蠢，殘酷的民族是應該減亡的！「小孤雁」呢。是比較和緩了，它使土人酋長願意和白種人和解，不再互相殘殺，但是在畫面背後也附帶着一個條件，是：土人默認自己是白種人的附庸。</p>
<p>因為「小孤雁」秀蘭鄧波兒主演的，所以劇作者更從秀蘭和小酋長的交好，而以童稚之心事激發土人的「勇於改過」，其實，這又與「貢格廷」有什麼分別的地方？</p>
<p>導演呢，全片的展開，平舖直叙，除了充份描寫土人的愚蠢，殘酷之外，並沒有什麼成就可言。即是土人向馬巡隊攻擊的所謂「戰鬥」塲面，也因爲織接的不够明爽，不能顯示緊張狀態。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒的戲，我感到「小夏蒂」是最使人滿意的一部，因爲這戲能使她有儘量發揮演技的機會。「小孤雁」，沒有什麼特殊的成績，不過沒有使人討厭，像過去的幾個戲那樣。秀蘭更有一個缺點，就是她的眉毛和眼睛的地位過於接近，作憂慮的表情時，眉毛與眼睛更擠在一起，這樣，她的憂慮顯得非常「做作」，而導演偏偏在這里用了兩個「特寫」鏡頭。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Unfolds on Yongbin Road; Chinese Troops Reclaim Kunlun Pass; Heavy Casualties for Japanese Troops; Main Force Decimated; Entire Front Wavering; Chinese Air Force Bombs Japanese Positions Near Nanning; Nanning Now Under Four-Sided Encirclement</h3>
<p>Guilin - According to a phone call from a certain front-line commander, the Chinese troops recaptured Kunlun Pass late on the 20th, with morale extremely high. The main force is currently pursuing the defeated Japanese troops. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin - Since the Japanese occupation of Nanning in South China, the roads behind them have been gradually destroyed by the Chinese, creating a "kangaroo" situation. To secure a retreat route, the Japanese must maintain control of Nanning. To hold Nanning, they must occupy Kunlun Pass. Therefore, the main force of the Japanese army has been placed on the Yongbin Road, attempting to defend Kunlun Pass at all costs. Chinese troops ambushed from both sides of the road towards Qitang, Liutang, and other locations. Knowing that retreating to Nanning was not as good as a fierce assault on Kunlun Pass, a fierce guerrilla war on the Yongbin Road and a battle for Kunlun Pass unfolded. Kunlun Pass was once recaptured by the Chinese troops but was retaken by the Japanese on the 19th through a desperate attack. Chinese troops, realizing that the supply lines of the Japanese troops at Qitang, Batang, and Jiutang were about to be cut, intercepted and killed them, putting the Japanese in a dilemma. Therefore, on the 20th, they launched a brave and fierce attack, recapturing Kunlun Pass that evening. The intensity of this decisive battle was rare in recent times. The Japanese relied on their superior firepower to suppress the Chinese, with planes flying in circles in swarms, fiercely bombing the Chinese positions. The Chinese troops paid no heed and finally drove back the stubbornly resisting Japanese troops. The heavy casualties suffered by the Japanese are enough to chill their hearts, while the Chinese casualties were also significant. This time, the Chinese troops' recapture of Kunlun Pass not only caused the entire Japanese front to waver, but the time for the complete annihilation of the Japanese is not far off. Kunlun Pass is the most dangerous place on the Yongbin Road, stretching for ten Chinese miles. The pass is particularly steep, like the throat of Nanning. Apart from Kunlun Pass, Jiutang, Batang, and Qitang on the Yongbin Road have some strategic value, but Liutang gradually becomes flat. The mountainous terrain near Ertang is slightly undulating but not considered dangerous. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to news this morning, the Chinese air force participated in the counter-offensive against Nanning yesterday. Chinese planes bombed Japanese positions near Nanning, causing significant losses to the Japanese. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese planes bombed various locations in Guangxi, attempting to stop the Chinese counter-offensive. (21st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou - The Chinese troops have been attacking the Qin-Dong area for days, capturing many prisoners. They stormed Xiaodong twice, inflicting particularly heavy damage on the Japanese. The Japanese immediately dispatched the Kishi Regiment and the Sasebo Naval Landing Force, advancing in three routes from Yuping, Qinggang, and Naxiang towards Shangjing. After the Chinese bravely resisted and launched a fierce flanking attack near Nalong, fierce fighting ensued for two days and nights. The Japanese abandoned hundreds of corpses and fled in disarray towards Qin-Dong. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to recapture strongholds such as Taiping, Shangjing, Xinping, and Dabao. Another unit of the Chinese troops recaptured Niugang on the 19th, killing many Japanese. The Japanese troops fled towards Qingtang from Qinzhou, and the Chinese are currently in pursuit. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese military spokesperson stated today while receiving newspaper reporters that the recovery of Nanning is imminent. The vanguard of the Chinese troops has reached the suburbs of the city. One column of Chinese troops advancing from Wuming has advanced to a location only ten miles from Nanning. Another column advancing from Binyang has advanced to a location fifteen miles northeast of the city. The spokesperson detailed the Chinese army's determination to recover Nanning, as the city controls the highway traffic to French Indochina, which observers see as China's lifeline. It was also stated that last week, the left wing of the Chinese army advanced west in two groups, cutting off the highway at two points south of Nanning to prevent the Japanese from transporting reinforcements and supplies from the coast via Qinzhou to Nanning. At the same time, the Chinese troops from Wuming and Binyang began their offensive, encircling the city. The main force of the Japanese army is currently concentrated on the highway northeast of Nanning. On Sunday night, the Chinese troops on the Binyang Road captured Kunlun Pass, the gateway to Nanning. Another group of Chinese troops fought behind the main force of the Japanese army, recovering Wutang, fifteen miles northeast of Nanning, cutting off the retreat route of the Japanese troops at Kunlun Pass. This afternoon, it was announced here that the Chinese troops had recovered Batang, a key point northeast of Nanning. According to Chinese sources, now that Batang is in the hands of the Chinese army, the encirclement of Nanning is complete. According to the latest Chinese military reports, the Japanese troops in Qinzhou are attempting to restore traffic with Nanning, launching a fierce attack on Lingshan to threaten the rear of the Chinese troops defending the highway south of Nanning, but they have been repelled by the Chinese troops. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to the Chinese military spokesperson to foreign reporters today, the Japanese troops in Nanning are under four-sided encirclement. The recovery of Nanning is imminent. There is one Japanese division currently in Nanning, and they are now rushing to build defensive fortifications in Nanning, such as in the northeast and northwest suburbs of Nanning and along the Yu River, all of which are being reinforced. (21st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Director of Kunming Headquarters Concurrently Held by Long Yun</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government issued an order on the 21st, specially appointing Long Yun as the Director of the Kunming Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on the Hanyi Road Repeatedly Defeated by Chinese Troops; Most of the Japanese Troops at Liujia Temple Annihilated; Scattered Japanese Troops in Various Villages Gradually Cleared Out</h3>
<p>Yichang - The Japanese troops who previously advanced westward on the main Hanyi Road have penetrated deep into the Chinese positions but have been repeatedly defeated by the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops scattered in various villages have also been gradually cleared out by the Chinese.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Recent Actions</h3>
<p>To be fair, the Japanese have their own strengths, and it is not appropriate to belittle them lightly as being completely worthless. However, Japan's attempt to annex and unify a fully unified China is a case of being blinded by greed, resulting in every action being wrong and utterly futile. The recent actions they have taken in the military, diplomatic, and political spheres are all of a lower intelligence, which is not due to ignorance but solely to being blinded by their own greed.</p>
<p>Before pointing out recent events, let's briefly review the past: Japan took advantage of China's natural and man-made disasters during the September 18th Incident. If they had assessed their capabilities and maintained a state of security and prosperity, dedicating all their efforts to diligently managing the Northeast, then by today, not only would they have established a more solid foundation in the Northeast, but they would also have been able to command respect and dominance on the international stage. Even if this had not been the case, the European war would have created yet another golden era for them economically. This can be stated with certainty. However, they became greedy and coveted Tianjin and Beijing, indulging in grandiose ambitions and failing to exercise self-control. The Xi'an Incident in China proved that the Chinese nation was moving towards reconciliation through sincerity and dedication. At this point, Japan should have awakened and changed course, but it did not. The Lugouqiao Incident proved that the Chinese government, military, and civilians were completely united for the final stand. At this point, Japan should have pulled back from the brink and changed its plans, but it did not. Ignoring the fact that a fully unified China could not be insulted, they still pursued a quick and decisive victory, repeatedly making mistakes and leading themselves to their current predicament.</p>
<p>What is the situation today? Militarily, they are exhausted from defending the points and lines they have occupied. The large-scale offensive they launched in northern Hunan ended in failure. These are all undeniable facts, so we will not discuss them in detail. Let's ask, what is the meaning or value of dividing their forces to attack Guangxi? Diplomatically, they have exhausted all their tricks and resorted to all sorts of ugly tactics towards Germany, the Soviet Union, and Britain and France, achieving nothing. While they can attribute the reason for this to the hesitation and vacillation of Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, leading to the failure of Japan's tactics, we will set aside that minor argument. Let's ask, what is the use or hope of currying favor with the United States by proclaiming the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River as a strategy? Politically, we will not discuss what they have done in Peiping and Nanjing. We will not discuss the so-called "cooperative body" or the "new order." Peace is naturally the end of war, but Tokyo is collectively preaching "Mahayana" Dharma, still unable to shed its narrow-mindedness. It is evident that they cannot forget their desire for control, but they are unable to achieve it. This thing, this ambition, is completely contradictory. What path or future do they have? Are we intentionally disparaging them? In reality, they are utterly futile!</p>
<p>The Japanese have the strength of being diligent and persistent, and with this, they are able to delve deeply and succeed in academic research and business ventures. However, using this same spirit to attempt to annex a China that cannot be annexed is a grave mistake. Recently, their all-out efforts in the military, attacking Guangxi; in diplomacy, currying favor with the United States; and in politics, calling for peace, are all due to their thinking being numbed by a single thought of greed. They are scratching an itch from afar without realizing it. In military terms, either removing the firewood from under the pot or achieving victory through surprise may have had some hope of success in the early stages of the war. However, after two and a half years of prolonged warfare, there is absolutely no possibility of achieving any luck. Unable to achieve success in any of their advances, Japan suddenly attacked Guangxi. Those who know the situation assert that there is absolutely no strategic reason for this, while those who do not understand may feel that it is unfathomable. When their generals sent telegrams to the military and civilian leaders of Guangxi, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu, enticing them with compromise, the Japanese's delusional wishes were exposed. It was then realized that the heavily hyped landing in Beihai was a military attempt with no chance of success. Such attempts are known by those of average intelligence to be ineffective and will not be made, but the Japanese do it. In diplomacy, there are various methods for influencing other countries, such as imposing treaty obligations, enticing with interests, or appealing to justice and emotion. In the case of the United States and the Far East issue, treaty obligations, interests, and justice and emotion are all fully aligned. Therefore, the only way for Japan to influence the United States is to respect the relevant treaties of the United States, respect American interests, strive for justice, and cultivate friendship. What other actions would be effective or hopeful? After a long period of erosion and repeated breaches of trust, Japan merely proclaims the so-called willingness to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, hoping to win back the heart of the United States. Those with common sense can know that this is ineffective, but the Japanese are indulging in this delusional wish. In politics, China has its absolute standards, which are the completeness of sovereignty, territory, and administration. If Japan can respect these standards, then all Chinese people will be willing to cease hostilities and seek peace. If they cannot meet these standards, even if someone signs any treaty with Japan, the war will still not end, peace will still not be achieved, and Japan will still not be able to extricate itself from the quagmire. The key to this is simple and clear. However, Japan is unable to sincerely respect the absolute standards held by China, yet it wants to extricate itself from the quagmire and dominate a peaceful utopia. In short, the Japanese are not stupid, but they have not yet been able to recover their normal rationality. Compared to the madness of a year ago, they are gradually recovering their obscured consciousness. Therefore, they know that fierce fighting is ineffective and that compromise is the only way; that unilateralism is unacceptable in diplomacy and that the understanding of other countries must be obtained; and that peace must be sought from China in politics. Being obscured, they are like a blind man riding a blind horse. It remains to be seen how long it will take for them to transition from being obscured to being clear and perceptive.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Hu Meets with US President, Reports on the Current State of the War of Resistance, States That Offensives Have Been Launched on All Fronts; President Roosevelt Is Quite Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Washington - The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, paid a visit to President Roosevelt today, informing him that Chinese troops have launched offensives on all fronts. He told reporters afterwards that "Our situation is not as difficult as some people imagine. This is what I told President Roosevelt. In terms of transportation, although some transportation lines in Guangxi Province have been cut off after the invasion, they are not of major importance. We are now building new roads to replace them. Our troops are launching offensives on all fronts, and more good news will be reported soon." (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Hu Shih, met with President Roosevelt yesterday, reporting on the optimistic situation of China's resistance against the Japanese invasion. Last week, the President invited Hu Shih to the White House for a meeting during a diplomatic banquet. Hu Shih stated, "I told the President that the situation in China is not as dire as some people imagine, and the President was very enthusiastic about this. I also told the President that the Japanese invasion of southern China and the cutting off of Chinese transportation routes did not have a significant impact on China's war of resistance. We are currently building new highways to obtain new supplies." Hu Shih continued that the Chinese army is attacking the Japanese army on all fronts and expressed, "We will soon hear more news of victories." Hu Shih spoke highly of President Roosevelt, calling him "one of the most knowledgeable people in the world regarding international affairs." (21st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>United States Tightens Blockade of Aviation Resources to Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union, Prevents Leakage of Gasoline Refining Technology</h3>
<p>Washington - The State Department recently issued a press release stating, "For the sake of national interests, this Department has exchanged opinions with the Departments of the Army and Navy and has decided to advise domestic manufacturers not to supply certain countries with drawings, tools, and other technical knowledge related to the refining of high-grade gasoline." Diplomatic sources here recently stated that this measure applies to Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. The State Department will notify the major gasoline plants in the country accordingly. The government had previously advised domestic merchants not to ship kerosene to these countries, but these countries had already stored large quantities of kerosene. If they also acquire the knowledge and ability to refine high-grade gasoline, even if American merchants comply with the government's advice and no longer supply kerosene to these countries, it would be difficult to achieve practical results. This shows the State Department's intention in adopting the above decision, which is to prevent problems before they arise and to ensure that the measure of preventing kerosene from being shipped to certain countries is foolproof. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - The State Department yesterday expanded the "moral embargo" on the export of aircraft to various areas that bombard civilians, including not selling aircraft manufacturing rights and selling technical information on high-quality aircraft fuel.

<h3>United States Extends Credit to China; Account of Receipts and Disbursements Released</h3>

<h3>British Times Discusses Opening the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>London - Well-informed sources here have expressed their welcome for Japan's agreement to open the Yangtze River to navigation for all countries, considering it a clear sign of a more constructive policy by the Tokyo government. The Times' diplomatic correspondent stated that the purpose of this move by the Japanese is clearly to improve relations between Japan and the United States, hoping that the US State Department will renew its commercial treaty with Japan. A second purpose may be to improve relations between Britain and Japan. In short, the Japanese government's initiation of a policy that is not approved by its military "advancement elements" demonstrates considerable courage. Today, The Times also published an editorial stating that the news that Japan is reopening the Yangtze River to navigation for all countries as far as Nanjing is naturally welcomed by the general public. This is the first direct step towards restoring Shanghai as a trading center for the distribution of goods. However, the actual effect of this move may not be very great in practice. In recent years, many goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have been transported to Shanghai via detours. In addition, the goods transported down the Yangtze River by Japanese merchant ships have gradually restored the vitality of the Shanghai port. However, Nanjing is located more than a hundred miles from the mouth of the Yangtze River, and the section below that is only a small part of the Yangtze River entering the interior of China. If Yangtze River shipping to Shanghai is to have any significant impact, it is necessary to open the river as far as Hankou. However, this recent development is a promising sign. The exchange rate of Chinese legal tender has shown a more stable trend, which can be considered a reflection. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>

When asked about the Ambassador's thoughts on strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries, he replied, "The friendly relations between China and Turkey are becoming increasingly close, so the government's appointment of me to be the Ambassador to China is not only something that I personally feel honored and excited about, but the people of my country are also extremely pleased about, because China is the largest Eastern country with the highest culture and the longest history. I sincerely hope to do my best to enhance the friendly relations between the two countries." (21st dispatch)</p>

The meeting closed in a warm and intense atmosphere.

Langsdorff's bravery and decisiveness have added another hero to the glorious history of the German Navy, and he is the glory of the nation. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: After the captain of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," Captain Hans Langsdorff, committed suicide, the newspapers here expressed their respect for him, believing that this was a way to preserve the reputation of the German Navy and oppose Hitler's order to sink the ship. The Daily Telegraph reported that this act proves that Captain Langsdorff feared nothing more than losing his own honor. He was a true naval hero, who could not tolerate the humiliation inflicted upon him by Hitler and therefore committed suicide to cleanse it. His plight is extremely tragic, and all those who fought against him should pay their respects. The Times reported that "Captain Langsdorff felt extremely distressed and therefore resorted to suicide. Naval comrades from all countries, even in wartime, should sympathize with him. The famous German naval commander Graf Spee and many officers who have contributed to the development of the great traditional spirit of the German Navy will understand Langsdorff's predicament. These officers, although despised by the German authorities, have no other opportunity to serve their country other than being at their disposal, which is a pity." The News Chronicle reported that "After the German authorities ordered the sinking of the "Admiral Graf Spee," the German Navy was once again despised by the world. Langsdorff's suicide not only represented a protest on his own behalf, but also on behalf of the entire German Navy." (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Crew Members of the Columbus to Temporarily Remain in US Territory; Treated as Ordinary Merchant Seamen; Residence Limited to Sixty Days</h3>
<p>New York: The 589 crew members of the German liner "Columbus" (vulgar name), after their ordeal, were brought to the port by the American cruiser "Tuscaloosa" at 4:30 PM yesterday and landed on Ellis Island. The US Immigration Inspection Bureau (located on the island) treated them as ordinary merchant seamen and allowed them to reside in the United States for sixty days, after which they must leave the country on non-American ships. This liner sailed from Veracruz, Mexico, on the 13th of this month, carrying 591 crew members, including one woman. When it was scuttled, one man and one woman were injured and rescued by the British destroyer "Hyperion." The remaining 589 people were rescued by the American ship "Tuscaloosa." According to a crew member, no one except the captain knew where they were headed when they left Veracruz. However, they all believed that the voyage was intended to break through the blockade of British and French warships and escape back to their home country, as another German liner, the "Bremen," had done. They thought that the British warships were gathered outside Montevideo, Uruguay, waiting for the "Admiral Graf Spee" to sail out, and they might be able to escape, but they did not know that they would meet the British destroyer "Hyperion" before noon on the 19th of this month. At that time, they intended to enter American territorial waters, but the British ship was much faster than the "Columbus" and was quickly overtaken. The captain then ordered the crew to spread kerosene over the deck and in various compartments. All the crew members boarded lifeboats, leaving only nine people to be responsible for setting the fire. When the task was completed, they jumped into the sea. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: President Secretary O'Leary stated tonight that the US government has now received a more detailed report and believes that the German liner Columbus was scuttled to avoid encountering the Allied Navy outside the neutral zone or being captured by them. Since there was no naval battle, the issue of violating the neutral zone does not arise. The American ship Tuscaloosa, which rescued the crew members of the Columbus, arrived at Staten Island tonight and immediately transferred the rescued crew members to a riverboat to Ellis Island to be inspected by the US immigration authorities. The Columbus, weighing 32,565 tons, was the third largest merchant ship in Germany and was scuttled yesterday outside Cape Henry, Virginia. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses Franco-Soviet Relations; Majority of Committee Members Advocate Severing Ties; Two Communist Party Deputies Expelled</h3>
<p>Paris: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting this afternoon and decided to remove Vice-Chairman Billoux and Secretary Bond from their positions because they were members of the Communist Party. They then discussed the issue of relations between France and the Soviet Union. The majority of the committee members, including the leader of the centrist Democratic Republican Union and former Prime Minister Flandin, advocated severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, saying that if the government did so, it would have a positive impact on neutral countries such as Spain and Italy.

It was not until today that former French Ambassador to Japan, Billa, and Counselor Miyazaki of the Japanese Embassy in France reached a new agreement and finalized various implementation measures. Billa then made a statement to the press, saying that the misunderstanding caused by this dispute between France and Japan had lasted for more than a decade. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Stalin's Sixtieth Birthday; Pravda Publishes Stalin's Brief History: Father Was a Shoemaker, Mother Was a Serf's Daughter; Presiding Over the Soviet Political Situation for Seventeen Years</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued an order today stating: "Comrade Stalin organized the Bolshevik Party, created the Soviet state, built a socialist society within the Soviet Union, and consolidated the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, achieving world-shaking feats. On the occasion of his sixtieth birthday, he should be awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and the Order of Lenin, the highest Soviet honor, as a reward." The Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, in commemoration of Stalin's sixtieth birthday, has decided to establish the following prizes: (1) Sixteen Stalin Prizes for Science and Literature, each with an annual prize of 100,000 rubles, awarded to scientists and artists with outstanding achievements in physics, mathematics, engineering, chemistry, biology, agronomy, medicine, philosophy, economics, history, linguistics, law, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and stage and film arts.

(3) Stalin Military Science Prizes, with three first prizes each year, each worth 100,000 rubles, five second prizes, each worth 50,000 rubles, and ten third prizes, each worth 25,000 rubles. (4) Four thousand Stalin Prizes for Higher Education Students, each worth 500 to 1,000 rubles. (5) One hundred and fifty Stalin Scholarships for Scientific Preparatory Personnel, each worth 1,000 to 1,500 rubles. Pravda also published Stalin's brief history as follows:</p>
<p>Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (original surname Dzhugashvili) was born on December 21, 1879, in the town of Gori, Tiflis Province. His father, Vissarion Dzhugashvili, was a Georgian, originally a farmer in the village of Didivelo in the same province, later moved to the town of Gori and became a shoemaker. His mother, Ekaterina, was the daughter of a serf.</p>
<p>Stalin entered the Gori Church School in 1888 and graduated in 1894, entering the Tiflis Theological Seminary. At the age of fifteen, he became involved with secret Russian revolutionary groups. In 1897, he became the leader of a secret Marxist group within the seminary. In August 1898, he formally joined the Tiflis branch of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.</p>
<p>When Lenin's "Iskra" newspaper began publication in 1900, Stalin fully accepted its position. In 1900 and 1901, strikes occurred frequently in Tiflis. In 1901, the illegal May Day demonstration held in the center of Tiflis was organized and led by Stalin. At that time, the Tsarist Russian government was deeply alarmed by the development of the revolutionary movement and intensified its suppression. On March 22, 1901, the police searched Stalin's residence. Stalin was then forced to go underground until the February Revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>The Tsarist Russian government, realizing that Stalin was an outstanding revolutionary, did its best to obstruct him. Between 1902 and 1913, Stalin was arrested eight times, exiled seven times, and escaped from exile six times. In September 1901, Stalin was elected as a member of the Tiflis branch committee of the Social Democratic Labor Party (abbreviated as SDLP). In November, he went to Batum to form a local SDLP branch, led strikes, and organized a large-scale political demonstration in March of the following year, personally leading the march. In early April 1902, he was arrested for the first time, but he maintained contact with the revolutionary movement in prison, thus learning about the serious differences between the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, and Stalin resolutely supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks' position. At the end of November 1903, Stalin was sentenced to exile in the village of Novaya Uda, Irkutsk Province, in eastern Siberia. On January 5, 1904, he escaped from the village and returned to the Caucasus to engage in revolutionary work. In December 1905, he served as the representative of the Bolsheviks in the Transcaucasian region and attended the first All-Russian Bolshevik Conference held in Tampere, Finland, where he first met Lenin. Stalin was also very active at the Fourth Congress of the SDLP held in Stockholm in 1906, and together with Lenin, he strived for the Bolshevik line in the development of the revolution. In 1907, he attended the Fifth Congress held in London.</p>
<p>In 1907, Stalin began to engage in revolutionary activities in Baku, the largest industrial city in Transcaucasia and one of the important centers of the Russian workers' movement. Stalin worked hard in the city for a year, making the workers support Bolshevism. On March 25, 1908, Stalin was arrested for the second time. After being imprisoned for eight months, he was sentenced to exile in Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province, for two years. But on June 24, 1909, he escaped for the second time and returned to Baku to engage in illegal activities. On March 23, 1910, he was arrested for the third time in Baku and, after being imprisoned for six months, was sent back to Solvychegodsk. In the late summer and early autumn of 1911, he escaped for the third time and went to St. Petersburg. On September 9 of the same year, he was arrested for the fourth time in the city and exiled to Vologda Province for the third time. In January of the following year, a major event occurred in the SDLP, the Prague Conference of the Party expelled the Mensheviks and organized the Bolsheviks. Stalin was elected as a member of the Party Central Committee in absentia and, on Lenin's recommendation, was appointed as the director of the Russian Bureau of the Central Committee. At that time, Stalin was in exile and had to find a way to escape, so Ordzhonikidze, on Lenin's orders, went to Vologda to see Stalin and give him instructions. Stalin then escaped for the fourth time on February 29, 1912.</p>
<p>In that year, on Stalin's initiative, the first mass newspaper of the Bolshevik Party, "Pravda," began publication in St. Petersburg. Its first issue was personally directed and edited by Stalin, and its content clearly declared its political orientation.</p>
<p>On April 22, 1922, Stalin was arrested again on a street in Petrograd. After being imprisoned for several months, he was sentenced to exile in the Narym region for three years. But on September 1 of that year, Stalin escaped back to Petrograd, where he edited the "Zvezda" and "Pravda" newspapers, and directed the Bolsheviks' activities during the Fourth Congress elections. Stalin took great risks to attend emergency meetings in various factories and deliver speeches. During this period, his relationship with Lenin became even closer. Lenin personally wrote to express his complete approval of Stalin's activities, speeches, and writings. Stalin visited Lenin in Gorki twice and attended meetings, and while living abroad, he wrote his historical masterpiece "Marxism and the National Question." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>US Secretary of War Expresses Thoughts on the European War: The Security of the Americas Depends on the Efforts of the People</h3>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of War Woodring delivered a radio address tonight on the security of the Americas, stating that the current expansion of the European war is a major hidden danger to the peace and security of the Americas. War is like a wildfire; a single spark can lead to a conflagration. Security does not depend solely on the size of a nation's military, its economic wealth, its location, or its moral strength, but all of these are necessary. My primary responsibility is to ensure that the US Army is prepared to deal with any threat of aggression. However, I am also extremely concerned about the nation's economic structure and the moral qualities of its people. Why have countries failed to resolve disputes through roundtable talks? Even wars with righteous causes cannot end war, only weaken and consume civilization. Ordinary diplomatic contacts in Europe are decreasing, while the need for a common gathering place for all countries is increasing. In recent months, a powerful public opinion group has emerged around the world, supporting the idea that only on a foundation of honesty can the future of civilization be guaranteed. What they consider glorious is not only fulfilling current promises but also acknowledging and correcting past mistakes. The peace and security of the Americas depend on the ability of the people to make the Americas strong militarily, economically, morally, and spiritually. Only the struggle to rebuild moral armament can give people hope for a war that can truly end all wars. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Taiwan Chinese Association, Chen Fa-li, Dies a Martyr in Taiwan; Detained by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office for Two Years; Poisoned to Death for Refusing to Submit to Japan</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there were more than 80,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan, four-fifths of whom were from Fujian, mostly engaged in tailoring, hairdressing, goldsmithing, and restaurant businesses. After the August 13th Shanghai Battle, more than 50,000 people returned to China. However, there were still about 20,000 people who could not return to China due to environmental pressures (such as having industries in Taiwan or marrying Taiwanese wives). Chen Fa-li, chairman of the Taiwan Chinese General Association, was arrested and imprisoned by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office in mid-September of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) for leading overseas Chinese to return to China. He was repeatedly ordered to initiate the organization of a pro-Japanese overseas Chinese group, but Chen refused. For more than two years, he did not change his original intention. On October 6 of this year, a prison guard gave Chen a potion and released him from prison. The next day, he died suddenly. Fellow villagers collected his body and buried it in the Taipei Sanshan Cemetery. More than 300 people attended the funeral, and although under the surveillance of Japanese police, all shed tears for him. Taiwanese people watching by the roadside also sighed for him, showing how deeply he moved people. Chen's family in Fujian did not receive the bad news until mid-November and held a funeral. Currently, party, government, military, business, and academic organizations and groups, considering Chen's strong integrity and admirable character, and lamenting the death of a loyal and righteous man, will hold a grand memorial service in Fuzhou on December 17 to express their condolences. Chen was a native of Minhou County, currently 48 years old. He became an orphan at the age of 15 and went to Taipei to learn goldsmithing, from apprentice to partner to shop owner. Most of the money he earned in his life was used to handle charitable and public welfare undertakings. In 1922, he first founded the Sanshan Charity Society and the Chinese School in Taipei, with remarkable achievements. In 1926, seeing that overseas Chinese in Taiwan were scattered in various places, with no organizational society and no consulate, like loose sand and subject to bullying, he gathered comrades to organize the Chinese General Association in Taipei, and guided overseas Chinese to set up more than 30 association halls, raising a fund of more than 200,000 yuan, specifically for handling relief and litigation. In 1926, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Chen immediately notified all overseas Chinese organizations and shops in Taiwan to uniformly hang the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, and held entertainment events. This immediately provoked resentment from the Japanese. Then he represented overseas Chinese in returning to China to petition the National Government to establish a Taiwan General Consulate, which was eventually achieved. He then went to Hainan Island to inspect, recognized the necessity of development, and raised capital of 500,000 yuan in Taiwan to organize the Qiongdong Plantation Company, planning to plant rubber and mine minerals. Later, the plan was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. When the Shanghai Battle broke out, Chen first sent his family back to Fujian, and then temporarily stayed in Taiwan to assist the consulate in handling the affairs of overseas Chinese returning to China, intending to withdraw with the General Consulate in the end, but unexpectedly he was arrested and martyred, which is also lamentable.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Attacks Japanese Army Along the Xiaolonghai Railway Line; Fierce Battles on the 7th, 8th, and 9th</h3>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Communication: Since the Chinese army recaptured Xinba Wangzhuang near Donghai last month, the Chinese army has been unusually active recently. The Zhang Yi troops of the Chinese army, which are responsible for guerrilla warfare along the Xiaolonghai Railway, have recently cooperated with local guerrillas to repeatedly attack the Japanese army in Baitabu Niushan. The battles have been particularly fierce. The battle situation of the past few days is recorded as follows: After dusk on the 7th, Zhang Yi sent a part of his strong troops, led by Regiment Commander Li, to rush to a certain place overnight to make arrangements. Then, they attacked the Japanese army in Baitabu. At the same time, another part was sent to feign an attack on the Japanese army in Donghai to exert a restraining influence. The Japanese army in Luofeng was attacked by a local guerrilla team. Zhang Yi also accompanied a certain regimental commander to personally command on the front line. At 10:00 pm that night, the arrangements were completed, and the attack on the Japanese army began. At that time, the Japanese army had already fallen asleep. In a hurry, they relied on the terrain to resist. The Chinese army, ambushing in a certain place, simultaneously bombarded fiercely with small mortars. The morale of the Chinese army was particularly high, and they threw hand grenades fiercely at the Japanese, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army charged and killed near Luofeng, attacking from both sides, capturing a lot. When dawn was approaching, the Chinese army safely withdrew after the mission was completed. In this battle, more than 70 Japanese soldiers were killed, and more than 100 to 200 were lightly and seriously injured. On the 8th, the Chinese army continued to attack the Japanese army in Caopu and Niushan. In view of the loss last night, the Japanese army immediately reinforced with more than 500 troops from Donghai to defend the two towns and build fortifications, holding firmly without coming out. At the same time, sent sentries to strictly guard and cut off transportation. The Chinese army, seeing that they were stubbornly defending, changed their plans to consume the Japanese army. They selected strong soldiers, carrying a large number of hand grenades, sneaked into the Japanese army's positions, and threw them fiercely. The villagers in the Pingmingzhuang, Baitabu, and Niushan areas were greatly excited by the Chinese army's repeated victories in attacking the Japanese army in the past month. They specifically held a military-civilian joint celebration meeting in a certain place on a certain day to connect feelings and ensure that the military and the people were integrated. The villagers even made an embroidered banner and presented it to Zhang Yi to express their love and support.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Northern Guangdong Fiercely Attacks Yuantan in Three Routes; Bloody Battle at Wangzishan; Japanese Planes Bombard Wildly and Cruelly</h3>
<p>Shaoguan Communication: Fierce battles have recently occurred in the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. The Japanese army of more than 1,000 in Yinzhan'ao Longtang, after days of rest, planned to advance north again. On the 7th, 2,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery were reinforced from Juntian with 11 light and heavy artillery pieces. At 2:00 am on the 8th, they attacked Yuantan in three routes. The left wing attacked Dalian from the Rams Snake Mountain northeast of Longtang, the central route attacked Yingzui head-on from the front of the railway, and the right wing attacked Jianfengling from Shangxiashixia. Each advanced with a highly mechanized unit as cover. The Chinese army lined up to meet the attack separately, launching fierce battles. At dawn, six Japanese planes took turns bombing Dalian, Yingzui, Changgang, and Da Mao Shan. Chinese army officers personally commanded, morale was high, and by noon the Japanese army had reinforced again. In order to avoid excessive sacrifices, the Chinese army temporarily withdrew from Yingzui and changed to defend the mountains south of Yuantan. After the Japanese infantry and cavalry invaded Yingzui and other places, they continued to advance north, attempting to break through the Chinese army's Yuantan defense line. However, the Chinese army advanced wave after wave, standing firm. In the area north of Dalian to Wangzishan Jianfengling, there were fierce clashes with the Japanese army. More than 500 Japanese infantry and cavalry repeatedly tried to break into the Chinese positions on Wangzishan (south of Yuantan). The Chinese army, occupying high ground, fired fiercely and engaged in melee combat three or four times. The Japanese army could not succeed, leaving two or three hundred bodies. In the evening, the Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a brave counterattack, once defeating the Japanese army. However, after a short while, the Japanese army reinforced again and attacked again. At night, the Wangzishan area was still in a mixed battle. On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army continued to reinforce, still attacking Yuantan in three routes. The Chinese army had severely defeated the Japanese army in the Jin Gou Zhen and Da Mao Ling areas, causing hundreds of casualties to the Japanese and puppet troops. The heaviest loss was the Japanese army's San Cai detachment. After the Da Mao Ling battle, only three or four hundred soldiers of the unit remained, and they were defeated and fled towards Changgang, attempting to reorganize the remnants and then decide on reinforcements. Currently, in addition to the three or four hundred troops of the San Cai unit in Changgang, the rest are all puppet troops, numbering thousands. There is also a Japanese army food station, storing a large amount of food. The source of the miscellaneous grains and rice is from looting in various villages. Judging from the recent battles on the front of the Yuehan Railway, the Japanese army's harassment is quite rapid. The Japanese army first attacked Yinzhan'ao from Juntian, and now they are attacking Wangzishan and attempting to break into Yuantan. Currently, the two sides are fighting in the outskirts of Yuantan. The Japanese army has only obtained a straight-line traffic point. Also, on the afternoon of the 9th, there was still a fierce battle between Wangzishan and Jishitian. Another unit engaged in mixed combat in Mengtian, and the battle was extremely fierce. The Japanese army used air and ground forces to attack until the unit at Mengtian was destroyed by the Japanese aircraft and once transferred, until the Japanese air forces were ineffective in the evening the Chinese forces then staged a counterattack at Mengtian, and simultaneously bombed Jishitian, and subsequently captured Mengtian. In response to this victorious momentum the Chinese forces proceeded to then attacked Jishitian, On the 8th the Japanese continued to heavily and repeatedly bomb the Yuehan Railway south sector the areas including the Yuebei Qingyuan, Yingde, Fogang areas in a scheme to restrain the Chinese army reinforcements, from the date of commencement a total of nineteen Japanese machines were launched, among which a large proportion of the areas surrounding Yingzui, Yuanpiao, Pajiang, Feilaixia, and the Qingyin highway routes were the worst hit, with a statistical amount of over a hundred missiles launched, and the destruction of innumerable civil buildings, and severe losses incurred. The Japanese forces pursued and attacked the civil water craft along the Bei River and consequently the civilians on the front lines are actively evacuating, the Chinese various road reinforcements are actively coming to aid.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Jiaxing Once Captured the County Seat</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Communication: The Chinese army stationed in the XX area north of Jiaxing was ordered to attack the county town a few days ago. They boarded farmer boats and sailed to the outskirts of the city, then attacked the pseudo-police station in Zayen. The pseudo-police, seeing this, abandoned their weapons and fled. The Chinese army did not pursue them and continued to advance towards the Yuehe River in the city. The Japanese and puppet troops and police there heard the news and relied on fortifications to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army fought bravely and finally repelled the Japanese and puppet troops. The Chinese army then recovered the Beidou area of the county town. Later, because the mission had been completed, they withdrew to their original positions. It is heard that seven Japanese and puppet troops and police were killed in this battle, and the pseudo-police patrol chief Jin Sheng was also captured.</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Championship Changes Hands; Americans Win the Shenbao Cup; Chinese Team's Performance Last Night Showed Considerable Improvement; Result: Defeated Again 34 to 62; Third Game Tonight at 8 PM</h3>
<p>The championship of the Third Shenbao Cup Sino-US Charity Basketball Tournament has fallen into the hands of the Americans. After the Chinese team was defeated in the first game, they reorganized their lineup and supplemented their best players. Unfortunately, the strength of this year's American team is exceptionally strong. In the second game last night, the Chinese team was defeated 34 to 62. In the first half, the situation was tense, with a strong defense, 13 to 25, only a difference of eight points. Since the American team has won two games in a row, the Shenbao Cup has been taken by them. It is not a problem to change hands temporarily. We will compete again next year. The third game tonight, although it is no longer related to the championship, will still be held as usual. The game will start at 8 PM, an hour later than the previous two games. At that time, the Chinese team may change its strategy and use surprise tactics to win.</p>
<p>Stalemate Lasted for Two Minutes</p>
<p>Last night, the American team initially took the court, still with the same five players of the McLain White team. The Chinese team's first line was Xianglong, Wen Kui, Nan Qun, Zhong En, and Bang Zhen. In the center jump ball, the ball was won by Changlu, who quickly passed it to Xianglong, who immediately reached the basket. Unexpectedly, Saqin Tuo Xie Li wore through, and Xianglong returned without success. Then Wang Nan Qun took a free throw, but missed the target. The Chinese team lightly lost the opportunity to open the record first. The stalemate lasted for as long as two minutes. Both sides' defenses were particularly tight, but Baodu Xue still opened the record. Saqin Tuo and Ke Lisi consecutively scored, taking a 6-0 lead. Although the Chinese team successively sent Da Mao and Shao Qing to replace Zhong En and A Kui, the formation was still loose, causing the American team's score to continue to increase. In an instant, it became a 13-0 disparity. It was not until Passko fouled and Sun Hui Pei made a free throw that the dull atmosphere was broken.</p>
<p>Tense Atmosphere, Golden Age</p>
<p>Seeing success, the Chinese team's morale suddenly became strong. Shao Qing shot, Wang and Sun made two free throws, and it was a natural success. A Kui stole a cold meal, and Bang Zhen and Nan Qun added more icing on the cake, successively adding more than 13 points, 14 to 19. The Chinese team quickly caught up, only five points behind. The atmosphere of the whole venue was greatly tense. This was the most prosperous period of the Chinese team last night. It is a pity that the Chinese team could not take the opportunity to rise to the top. Xu Wen Kui's godlike shooting was not godlike, missing the basket as many as seven times. Shao Qing and Nan Qun also repeatedly missed sure-shot opportunities. Although Passko of the American team had been ejected due to four fouls, and sharpshooter Henry Schweitz had entered the lane, but fate was the same for the Chinese. The misses were no less than ten times, causing the battle situation to stagnate for six or seven minutes. When the first half ended, the American team had 23 and the Chinese team had 15, the score was very close, with a difference of only eight points.</p>
<p>Changing Baskets and Fighting Again, the Situation Gradually Became Unfavorable</p>
<p>During the break, the West Qing Health Club still had a light and beautiful parallel bar performance, which won warm applause. Changing baskets and fighting again, the American team made a large adjustment, sending in new troops to the front line. Carson was also among those drafted, but because of Xianglong's close surveillance, there was no achievement at first. Although the Chinese team had many shooting opportunities, in the end, the ball luck was not good, so that even the so-called godlike shooter Xu Wen Kui missed with only a millimeter difference. However, the American team's sharpshooter Henry Schweitz was resourceful, making five out of five shots. With Robert Wanxu's two free throws, the score rose sharply. On the Chinese team's side, only Xianglong and A Kui scored four points. At this point, it became 38 to 19, the score differing by half.</p>
<p>Xianglong Fouled Out, the Overall Situation Was Lost</p>
<p>The Chinese team's frequent movements also gave people an opportunity. After Da Mao made a throw and a free throw, Ting Huel and Carson both made great contributions. Ke Lisi even used his tall body to invade again and again, 40 to 21. Xianglong committed four fouls and was fouled out of the court. The Chinese team became even more decadent. Xu Wen Kui once regained his penetrating skills. After 54 to 25, he shot successfully. Da Mao also added three points. Unexpected success is easily lost. The American team scored four goals in a row, and the recovery became hopeless. Xu Wen Kui lightly stretched his ape arm and hit two targets in a row. The bell had rung, and the Chinese team finally suffered a second defeat with 34 against 62.</p>

<h3>New New Handicap Dartball</h3>
<p>Zhu Qiliang wins over Bao Qiyun (800) 800-691. 5,460 people designated; 1,048 people assigned; 4,556 admitted students distributed; 235 students admitted without examination distributed.</p>
<p>The number of assigned students in the table above excludes the Shanghai region, as the Shanghai registration forms have not yet been sent, and the candidates' preferences are unknown. Therefore, the admitted students from the Shanghai region cannot be included in the distribution. Also, the situation in Shanghai is unique, so a separate distribution method will have to be determined. According to the figures in the table above, more than one-half of the students were assigned according to their first choice, and one-eighth each were assigned according to their second and third choices. The assigned students accounted for one-quarter of the total. The reason for the assignment is that the preferences were too concentrated. In terms of schools, the majority concentrated on Central University and Southwest Associated University, and in terms of departments, almost all concentrated on engineering. (See details in the following section.) Due to the over-concentration of preferences, the number of assigned students increased. However, I can solemnly report that the scope of the assignment was handled in accordance with the aforementioned standards and was approved by the subcommittee specially formed by the Unified Commission. Among the 1,048 people, 895 people were still assigned to the departments they preferred, but to different schools. The remaining 153 people were assigned to departments with very similar characteristics, seeking to accommodate the students' preferences as much as possible in this difficult situation. As for the total number of distributed students, it is still about twenty people short of the total capacity of the various schools. With the exception of a few schools, most have not yet reached their quota. This is because there are too few applicants for the departments of literature, science, agriculture, and commerce, while there are too many applicants for the various engineering departments and the departments of political science, economics, railway management, etc. Therefore, the total number of students assigned to each school cannot reach its quota. A table listing the departments to which the admitted students have been assigned is provided below. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Rectifies: Provincial Nantong Middle School Replaces Principal and Issues Notice to Students</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department's Shanghai Office recently removed Feng Yue, the acting principal of Provincial Nantong Middle School, from his post due to his improper attitude and inappropriate measures. Although a notice was published to clarify everything, criticisms from society were still frequent, and the school's excellent teachers left the school one after another, resulting in many absences. Disputes among students also occurred from time to time, and the order was unstable. In order to rectify the school, he was dismissed and Xia Shichang, a teacher at the school, was appointed to act as the principal. However, Feng has not yet complied with the order to hand over the school, so on the 19th of this month, he issued a notice to the students of the school, declaring that any certificates issued by Feng Jiji in the future will be invalid, and ordering them to await the new acting principal to carry out the school's reorganization.</p>

<h3>Grain: The Long-Troubled Rice Market Now Expected to Gradually Return to Normal; Reports Indicate Blocked Sources Under Negotiation; Speculators Nervous, Gradually Selling Off Stockpiles; As Long as Shanghai Market Stabilizes, Production Prices Will Immediately Fall; Rice Price of 30 Yuan Per Stone Still Offers Profit</h3>
<p>The rice market, after rectification, is now gradually returning to normal. However, what still feels insufficient is that the inland sources are still monopolized by a certain party, exporting and transporting rice to relieve the rice shortage in their country. It is reported that the number of rice to be purchased from the inland is initially set at 3 million stones, resulting in a shortage of rice sources in Shanghai in the past half-month. The reliance on huge amounts of foreign rice continuously arriving in Shanghai has alleviated concerns about the food supply for the local people. It is reported that efforts to unblock the inland sources are being negotiated with a certain party, and it is expected that a breakthrough will be achieved soon. It is also heard that the Adjustment Committee is planning to order huge amounts of foreign rice to suppress the rice price. The future of the rice market should have the hope of seeing the clouds clear and the sun shine, and restoring brightness in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The harvests in Wuxi and other places are not bad this year, and there is no risk of rice shortage within half a year. Shanghai rice merchants make excuses for scarce sources, or blocked sources, as if only allowing prices to rise freely can ensure rice to eat. However, it is not known that the production areas have no intention of blocking the rice. Because the rice price in Shanghai has risen too sharply, the rice merchants in the production areas are green with envy and are hoarding and transporting rice, hoping to make a fortune. This has caused prices in the production areas to rise constantly, leading to attention and restrictions. If the rice price in Shanghai can fall to within 30 yuan, then the production areas will inevitably fall accordingly. At a reasonable selling price, there will naturally be no restrictions on transportation. For example, if the rice price in Wuxi is 16 yuan, plus 4 yuan for packaging and transportation by the transportation company, and another 4 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, the cost to Shanghai is only 24 yuan. Selling it for 30 yuan is already a very good profit. Why must it be hoarded again and again, rising horizontally and vertically, causing panic? (Person)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the operation of the local rice market returned to its previous state. In the morning, the local shops, which had been virtually suspended for several days, urgently needed to replenish their stock. The merchants had a lot of remaining goods from the previous period and also sought to quickly sell them off, selling at a mutually agreeable price. Speculators were even more eager to unload their burdens. All three parties were entering and exiting at the same time, resulting in a large number of transactions. As a result, the market prices for all goods, except for Saigon rice, which had the largest sales volume and experienced slight fluctuations, were quoted according to the limited price. In particular, the Jiangsu white rice from Yanji and others was dumped in large quantities.</p>
<p>Customer’s indica rice’s arrivals and sales were sluggish. The market was flooded with foreign rice, leading to a price drop. The Jiangbei Wuhu market goods were still open at a limited price of 33 yuan, with the possibility of lowering it by three to five cents. However, Nanjing and special high-quality enamel were rarely sold. The total transaction for the day was only several hundred bags.</p>
<p>Although the foreign price of foreign rice has slightly decreased, the asking price of Saigon foreign merchants is still 47 and a half yuan to 48 yuan, making it difficult to sell. However, the original packaged goods on the road have slightly improved, with prices ranging from 42 yuan 70 cents to 43 yuan. The spot market is 36 yuan 30 cents to 35 yuan, which is also about half a yuan higher than the previous day. As the sales channels are gradually becoming active, the city is gradually switching back to rural continuation, the market is turning around, and the zero and wholesale transactions for the day amount to three to four thousand bags.</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: This county is a rice-producing area and a rice hub. All rice transported from Jiangyin, Changzhou, Yixing, Liyang, and other counties stays in this county. Its importance is no less than Wuhu and Shanghai. In previous years, rice prices, once new rice appeared, often fell sharply. In recent years, the highest price of new rice was no more than 10 yuan, with highs and lows of only five or six yuan. This year, due to special circumstances, in this autumn of new rice, rice prices did not fall but instead rose. In September and October, new rice sold for 18 or 19 yuan per stone, and in October and November, it fell to about 16 yuan. Afterwards, it began to surge. It was expected to gradually fall, but the opposite was true, and it gradually rose, reaching the current high price of 20 yuan. The reason for this is nothing more than rice merchants hoarding and manipulating the market, taking advantage of the scarcity to raise prices. Due to the unrest in the area, farmers are afraid of storing white rice, which can easily attract attention, so most have not yet sold their rice, but have adopted the method of gradually milling and selling it. This can reduce the risk, which is exploited by rice merchants, creating the main factor for this price increase. This year's harvest in this county was slightly damaged due to excessive rainfall, so the situation is uneven. The abundant harvests (mostly in high-lying fields) can yield two stones eight or nine per acre, while the poor harvests (mostly in low-lying fields) yield only one stone five or six. The average is about 70% of a good harvest. The so-called 70% means that in a full harvest year, each acre can yield three stones of white rice, which is commonly known as "one acre three burdens." If it is 70%, it is about two stones. Traditionally, farmers engage in milling and selling rice after harvesting, and the vast majority can complete it before the winter solstice. Hence the saying, "Taste the winter solstice dumplings." Rice prices fall the most at this time. This year, due to the current situation, normal practices cannot be followed, resulting in the quantity of rice stored in the warehouses in the urban and rural areas, which used to be 1 or 2 million loads, now being only 200,000 loads. With such a thin base, rice merchants can take the opportunity to manipulate the market. Although the difficulties in transportation and heavy taxes are facts, they are not as serious as the rice merchants claim. As far as we know, except for large quantities of rice that may inevitably encounter unexpected obstacles, for civilian ship transportation and smaller amounts, if the procedures are complete, there is no major problem. The people in the industry are already familiar with these procedures. There are no fixed rules for the taxes paid, and they are mostly determined according to the circumstances. According to transport merchants, the actual tax paid per stone of rice is about two to four jiao, and half for grain. However, there are many places to collect taxes, often requiring multiple payments before reaching the destination. When rice prices rose most sharply this time, it would sell for 21 yuan per stone, which is almost three times higher than in the past. Export was prohibited, and a limited price was set, which slightly stabilized it. (Hui)</p>
<h3>Wheat Mill Turnaround Sluggish; Flour Prices Already Difficult to Get Good</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour mill price was 8 yuan and 70 cents for the No. 2 authentic brand. The retail trade in this street was quite active, because the price of rice is expensive, the demand for flour is higher, and the factories can supply as much as possible to maintain the local people's food supply. However, customer sales are considered ordinary. According to Qingdao customers, each bag of flour sold in that area loses two yuan and seventy or eighty cents. Moreover, the oil market is sluggish, and the demand is even lower. Tianjin gangs also consider transportation unprofitable, and the number of people entering is very small. The total market transaction is called 10,000 bags. Except for local sales, the Nanyang gang only handles a little. The Japanese mill flour first weakened and then tightened. December Phoenix brand 8 yuan 1 jiao 4 cents, January 8 yuan 4 jiao 6 cents to 8 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday the market first tightened and then weakened. The sources are slightly decorated, and the costs are high. Everyone is thinking of selling at a good price, but the factory turnaround is sluggish, because the customer sales are currently difficult to be prosperous, only maintaining the local street. Flour prices are also difficult to get good, so prices are cut to get. The sellers are still struggling. As a result, the factory handles only 2,000 bags, the highest price is still 15 yuan. The middle class has decreased slightly. It is said that the goods transported from various places will soon arrive in Shanghai one after another, coupled with the imminent arrival of the lunar new year, so the market already feels loose.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Fall Sharply; The Most It Fell Was Twenty Yuan Per Load</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market, which had been stagnant for a long time, has revealed a sharp decline, and the downturn is difficult to reverse. Yesterday, the general hoarders were difficult to support and had to sell openly. As a result, except for Northeast barrel oil, which had no market, the rest all opened. The formal market price was about 20 yuan lower than the highest record (7th market). However, buying momentum turned strong in the afternoon, and the closing price had recovered three yuan. The statistics show that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 71 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at a price of 72 yuan, 150 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at a price of 73 yuan to 75 yuan, 76 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil were traded at a price of 96 yuan to 100 yuan, more than 1,000 loads of local factory oil were traded at a price of 77 yuan, and 39 barrels of Changzhou barrel oil were traded at a price of 97 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Exchange Market Re-Enters a Hovering State</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday did not fluctuate in HSBC listings. The black market for British and American exchange rates has entered a hovering state, and the changes are not significant. It was tight first and then recovered. The opening price in the morning was average. Afterwards, the Hua Shang yarn and flower gangs first came to buy, and the Chinese banks also ate in at the same time. In addition, the foreign banks' supply was weak, and the latent trend became tighter. By 9:50, it had shrunk to 4 pence 609375 and 7 yuan 5625. Then, as the speculation gradually subsided, the situation suddenly turned stable. This continued until noon. Suddenly, a telegram came from Hong Kong, so the situation recovered slightly. Until the noon close, it was 4 pence 65625 and 7 yuan 65625, which was slightly tighter by 03125 compared with the previous day. The trend of futures is no different from that of spot goods. However, this month, because the delivery is approaching, it has been flattened.</p>
<p>Yarn and Flower Gangs Still Selling In</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's big articles, both near and far, shrank by 0625. New York silver prices rose by one point, London's raw gold remained fixed, and the exchange rate of British versus American versus French was the same. The exchange rate against Shanghai was slightly 0625. The exchange rates of American versus British, Shanghai, and French were all the same. The bank opened the selling price of spot goods in the morning. The British gold was 4 pence 6875, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 6875, which was neither good nor bad compared with the previous close. After opening, the Hua Shang yarn and flower gangs first came to pull out and settle. At the same time, the Chinese banks also slightly ate in. However, due to the lack of interest in supply from foreign banks, the latent trend immediately tightened. By 9:45, the British gold had shrunk to 4 pence 609375, and the American exchange rate had also softened to 7 yuan 5625. The HSBC listing was announced without any movement, and the white silver balance tax was announced slightly 0.25. After that, there were fewer people pulling out, and the situation turned stable. As noon was approaching, a telegram suddenly came from Hong Kong, so it recovered slightly. Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 65625 for British gold and 7 yuan 65625 for the American exchange rate, which was slightly tighter by 03125 than the morning opening.</p>
<p>The Market Situation in the Afternoon Was Quite Quiet</p>
<p>The market situation in the afternoon was extremely dull. At first, the situation was slightly loose in the calm. British gold was 4 pence 65625 and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 6875, which could be settled once. Later, speculators slightly pulled out long-term, and it turned slightly tighter. After entering, the Chinese banks slightly sold out, and it returned to average. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 65625 for British gold and 7 yuan 65625 for the American exchange rate. The price of this month was the same as that of spot goods. The British gold was 4 pence 625 in January, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 53125. As a result, compared with the previous day, the spot British and American exchange rates were each tighter by 03125. The central government was 015625 tighter this month, and the American exchange rate was neither good nor bad. The result in January was comparable to that of spot goods.</p>
<p>No Rise or Fall in the Hong Kong Exchange Market</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The exchange rates were the same compared with the noon close yesterday. At 10:50, the Shanghai exchange rate rose by two yuan to 320 yuan. At 11:30, there was no rise or fall. The market opened at 2:30 pm, and there was also no rise or fall.</p>
<p>Tianjin's British and American Currencies Are Still Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, 21st: The exchange market opened averagely this morning. The British exchange rate shrunk by 0625 to 4 pence 4375, and the American exchange rate tightened by 125 to 7 yuan 25. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by half a yuan to 105 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" was 7 jiao and a half higher at 93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Speculation: Though Rising, Still Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash cooked red (gold) dark market conditions, with the exchange rate stable but slightly softening, large buyers from Hong Kong took the opportunity to buy low. However, amidst these favorable conditions, a certain Yu firm was aggressively speculating (settling forward foreign exchange and selling cooked red). High prices were difficult to sustain, but ultimately, the price still managed to rise by sixteen yuan. As for the day's process, it initially opened up twenty-six yuan at 4,170 yuan, due to tight foreign exchange rates. A certain money exchange firm was the first to buy. However, as the exchange rate remained tight and soft, coupled with Hong Kong interests entrusting a certain money exchange to manipulate the market, the price was pushed up to a peak of 4,185 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange rate stabilized and buying momentum waned, gold firms and silversmiths mutually dumped their holdings, causing the price to fall back. Around noon, the exchange rate hardened again, and a certain bank aggressively sold on behalf of its clients, driving the price down to a low of 4,149 yuan before the close. Fortunately, Hong Kong interests saw the low price and bought again, so the noon close was still 4,158 yuan. The afternoon opened higher, but soon gold firms dumped their holdings, and a certain money exchange firm re-entered the market, resulting in an evening close of 4,160 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Market Still Lacking Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>Securities trading continues to weaken. Market rumors that the government plans to issue 80 million yuan of foreign exchange bonds have caused renewed anxiety. The initial upward trend has suffered a setback, making it difficult to recover. One wave has not subsided, and another rises. Yesterday's opening was strong, but then weakened, failing to break the old pattern. Yichang sold, while Jiaoyong bought, mostly small retail investors. Type A shares fell more significantly in the afternoon due to a large number of sellers.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Buying on Dips Despite Lack of Forward Buying; Yarn Market Rebounds; Shuangma Rises by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>After two days of decline, the yarn market rebounded yesterday. Although the overseas cotton market remained weak, local industry players unanimously held a positive outlook and were eager to buy on dips. News that a stock exchange would be established in Tianjin spurred buying interest in 20-count yarn. Some speculated that the exchange rate would be adjusted, leading to increased buying. However, actual demand remained weak for most counts except for 32-count and 42-count yarn. Generally, prices rose when buyers entered the market after several days of decline, and then retreated when those who profited from the earlier rise dumped their holdings.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened flat this morning due to falling U.S. cotton prices, with forward prices breaking the one-jiao barrier. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 720 yuan, roughly the same as the previous day. However, large bullish players re-entered the market, and the market quickly became tight, causing prices to rise steadily to a closing price of 731.5 yuan. Statistics show that the trading volume for the half-day was 1,965 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 10 yuan, Shuang Earth rose by 8 yuan, Tiannv rose by 8 yuan. The China Textile Factory opened with 300 bales of 10-count Jinbao Star at 545 yuan and 200 bales of 20-count Jinbao Star at 675 yuan.

<h3>Factories Suspend Operations; Cotton Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>The cotton trade remained quiet, with few transactions among traders. Factories also suspended operations, further dulling the cotton market. Prices continued to decline, and the overseas Indian and American cotton markets also fell, further depressing sentiment. The supply from Northern Jiangsu was 1,235 bales of Tonghua cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Huoji: 155.00; traders bought 200 bales</p>
<p>Caobao: 153.00; traders bought 600 bales</p>

Indian contracts fell 10 rupees, Egyptian contracts fell 60-70 points, and Liverpool contracts fell 20 pence.</p>

<h3>Extraterritorial Road Construction Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached a Stage of Approximation; The Bureau's Intention Is to Firmly Reject the Countermeasures; The Puppet Government May Submit a Reply Next Week</h3>
<p>Regarding the negotiations on extraterritorial road construction, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) submitted a reply to the puppet municipal government on the 19th, the content of which was to reject the puppet's demands. Yesterday, continuing inquiries from various sources revealed that, in addition to rejecting the puppet municipal government's "counter-proposal" of November 11, the Bureau still left room for concessions, so that the negotiations could continue.</p>
<p>The Situation of this Case Is Very Tense</p>
<p>The extraterritorial road dispute reached an extreme point in the autumn of this year. With the support of the Japanese, the puppet municipal government insisted on a so-called "comprehensive" takeover of the extraterritorial roads. In late October, through the mediation of Consul-General Colonel Narońi, the two sides entered into negotiations. The SMC first drafted a proposed plan as a basis for discussion. Both parties refused to disclose the contents of the SMC's proposed plan, which was delivered to the puppet mayor on November 2.</p>
<p>The Initial Proposal of the Bureau</p>
<p>Inquiries from various sources finally revealed that, regarding the issue of donations and taxes, the SMC's proposal was to establish a separate special agency to collect donations and taxes on the extraterritorial roads, and to create a separate special account. The staff of the donation and tax agency would be appointed by both the concession authorities and the puppet municipal government. The same approach would be taken for the police power in the area, with police officers from both sides jointly stationed and patrolling.</p>
<p>The Puppet Government's Counter-Proposal Has Been Rejected</p>
<p>The above-mentioned proposed plan was submitted by Chuan Xiaonai on November 11 as a "counter-proposal," the content of which, in addition to adding opinions to the SMC's proposal, also included other terms and conditions proposed unilaterally by the puppet side. After careful consideration, the SMC decided to reject these demands and drafted a reply, which was personally delivered to Chuan Xiaonai by SMC Chairman Fessenden during a visit on the 19th of this month. This rejection reply still leaves a wide margin for discussion. It is believed that the puppet mayor may make another reply next week.</p>
<p>The Future Situation Remains to Be Developed</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that a certain morning newspaper reported that the SMC had rejected the "mayor" Fu Xiaoan's counter-proposal on extraterritorial road construction. SMC Director-General and President Fessenden denied this this morning (the 21st). He stated, "This statement is completely inaccurate." However, Fessenden refused to disclose the nature of the SMC's reply handed over on Tuesday evening. Fessenden also did not explain whether the SMC's reply contained any modifications to Chuan's counter-proposal or any new suggestions as a supplement. When asked by reporters whether he believed that the negotiations between the SMC and the "municipal government" on extraterritorial road construction would be resolved soon, Fessenden stated that he hoped so, as did many others.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Rise in Price Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association held a joint meeting of representatives from various factories on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Chairman Chen Cuifang. As a result of the discussion, it was generally agreed that the price of coal dust was trending upwards, increasing costs. Starting from the 21st of this month, (1) the wholesale price will be 75 yuan per ton, plus 2 yuan for transportation; (2) the door-to-door sales price will be 4.2 yuan per dan (100 jin). It is reported that Yi Taixing still quotes 4 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Central Farmers' New Auxiliary Coin Vouchers Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in the Amount of 500,000; The Exact Number of Central Bank's Jiao Notes Shipped to Shanghai Is Hundreds of Thousands; Three Batches of Fractional Currency Will Arrive and Be Issued Strictly; The Limit for Each Person Carrying Legal Tender to Shanghai Is 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the panic of the lack of fractional currency, auxiliary currency, and one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the Ministry of Finance has approved the Central Bank's printing of fractional currency vouchers and the issuance of already printed auxiliary currency vouchers in moderation, and has requested the Joint Office of the Four Banks to instruct the banks to quickly ship one-yuan notes to the Shanghai market in moderation to aid adjustment. The restriction on individuals carrying legal tender to Shanghai remains strict. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiao Notes</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency inquired with the Central Bank and learned that: (1) Two batches of fractional currency vouchers worth 500,000 yuan will be issued soon, and the third batch of five-fen vouchers worth 500,000 yuan will be issued in conjunction with the second batch. However, in order to prevent the inflow into occupied areas and storage for profit, a gradual issuance system is adopted, and applications will be strictly reviewed; (2) A large batch of one-yuan notes from HSBC, the Central Bank, and other banks has arrived and is being exchanged by the Central Bank, with a temporary limit of 20 yuan per person. They are now widely circulating in the market; (3) It is confirmed that 100,000 yuan of auxiliary currency vouchers (one-jiao and two-jiao notes issued by the Central Bank) were transported to Shanghai by the British firm HSBC the day before yesterday. The rumor that 2 million yuan was transported to Shanghai by the Changxing Company's Russian Empress is unfounded. According to investigations, the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 17th of this month and did not carry any auxiliary currency vouchers to Shanghai. Therefore, the report that the Central Bank will exchange them today is absolutely inaccurate. However, the Chinese Farmers Bank does have 500,000 yuan of new auxiliary currency vouchers that will be shipped to Shanghai from Hong Kong on a foreign ship, but the date of shipment has not yet been telegraphed.</p>
<p>Fractional Currency</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had previously received letters from the silk and satin and restaurant associations requesting that the Central Bank of China, Shanghai Branch, be allowed to distribute fractional currency vouchers on behalf of the associations. After requesting a discretionary allocation, they received a reply from the Central Bank stating that: "After investigating, this bank's decision to continue issuing fractional currency was not published in any newspaper announcement. However, prior to the issuance, various trade associations sent letters requesting registration. As the number of notes issued is limited, and the number requested for registration is very large, distribution is difficult. It was replied that a discretionary allocation would be made when the time came. The so-called discretionary allocation does not specify that the exchange will be carried out by various trade associations on behalf of the members. Since the issuance began, almost all merchants have applied for exchange themselves. This bank has reviewed and replied to each application separately, and the merchants have gradually exchanged the specified amounts according to the prescribed dates. If the exchange is carried out by the trade associations on behalf of the members, it would not only be redundant, but this bank would also not have a large amount of fractional currency to meet the demand. It is requested that your association forward the reply to the members and instruct them to apply for exchange separately, filling in the amount, and this bank will review and reply. In short, this bank has vouchers available for exchange and will exchange them in moderation."</p>
<p>Legal Tender</p>
<p>In order to prevent the outflow of legal tender into occupied areas, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that "anyone carrying legal tender from Wenzhou, Ningbo, Fuzhou in Zhejiang and Fujian, and places near the above-mentioned ports where customs sub-stations are located, to Shanghai, will be limited to 200 yuan per person. The excess amount will be confiscated and used for public purposes to stop the outflow. Those who need to carry more than the limit should remit the funds to a nearby bank." It has been telegraphed to the Zhejiang and Fujian Customs to comply with this regulation. Also recorded below is the joint announcement of the Zhejiang Customs Supervisor and Commissioner of Customs: "After investigating the case of restricting passengers from carrying banknotes out of various ports, each person must not carry more than 500 yuan, and the excess will be confiscated, which has been announced to all in cases No. 89 and No. 92 of this Customs. Now, we continue to receive the telegraphed order from the Ministry of Finance (see above for details). Therefore, we should comply with and handle this matter. As for passengers carrying foreign banknotes from the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian to Shanghai, the previous regulations still apply, and each person must not exceed 30 pounds of English gold, 150 U.S. dollars, or other foreign currencies of equal value. However, if passengers carry a mixture of Chinese and foreign banknotes, the Chinese banknote portion must not exceed 200 yuan. Except for branch banks, we hereby announce this to all merchants for their information."</p>
<h3>All Sectors Will Enthusiastically Commemorate the National Renaissance Day; Yunnan Zhaowei Memorial Will Be Held Simultaneously; Save Expenses by Printing and Selling Commemorative Bookmarks</h3>
<p>December 25th is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and the National Renaissance Day. All sectors in Shanghai will enthusiastically commemorate the day, but without emphasizing formalities. All sectors also believe that the Second Sino-Japanese War is progressing to a favorable stage and are determined to fulfill their responsibilities and quickly complete the great cause of national rejuvenation. The December 5th Zhaowei Uprising Memorial will be combined and held on this day. Silver and money businesses will be closed as usual. This day is also Christmas, and all sectors are promoting economical gifts and donating to refugees. In order to save expenses and eliminate old customs, all sectors plan to print and sell Renaissance Day commemorative bookmarks to replace New Year cards. It is said that there are five types of bookmarks, printed with the President's portrait and the President's aphorisms. The designs are very exquisite, and the price is set at one jiao per type. It is also planned to use the proceeds to fund public charitable undertakings after a certain amount has been collected.</p>
<h3>Tofu Shops Reopen; Price Increase Implemented This Morning</h3>
<p>Tofu shops in the two concessions, which had suddenly closed on the 19th to rectify market prices, have distributed the newly set price lists to various businesses and stall vendors. They have also announced that manufacturing work will be resumed from last night, and all businesses will reopen this morning (the 22nd). The new market price for tofu will be calculated in fen, with a minimum price of five fen, which will obviously increase the expenses for ordinary people's staple food.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops in the Two Concessions Resumed Normal Operations Yesterday; A Few Rice Shops Have Not Yet Fully Opened; The Number of Foreign Rice Shipments Has Increased Greatly, and the Market Situation Is Stable</h3>
<p>Shanghai West Side Holds Price-Controlled Rice Sales</p>
<p>After the authorities of the two concessions and the rice industry groups took emergency measures to strictly prohibit speculation and manipulation, rice prices in Shanghai have stabilized. Because the source of domestic rice is not smooth, while foreign rice has become more relaxed, rice merchants have ordered foreign rice, resulting in a large increase in the number of foreign rice shipments. Rice shops resumed business yesterday, and price-controlled rice sales were held in Shanghai West Side.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Resumed Business Yesterday</p>
<p>Of the more than 1,000 rice shops in the city, most of them had closed due to the rice rush. Now that rice prices have gradually fallen and the rice rush has subsided, the two concessions ordered the rice shops association to notify all rice shops to resume business. Therefore, most rice shops reopened yesterday as usual. Those shops located in border areas such as Haig Road, which are prone to incidents, are being monitored by patrolmen at all times, and are constantly guarded to prevent unforeseen events.</p>
<p>Price-Controlled Rice Sales Held in Shanghai West Side Yesterday</p>
<p>There are more ordinary people in the western part of Shanghai. Although rice prices have been reduced again to the price limit, the economic situation of the masses is still difficult to cope with. In this severe winter, there is a real concern that people will be forced to go astray due to the pressures of life. Although the rice rush has been suppressed, the panic has not been fundamentally resolved, which is detrimental to local security and peace. It is reported that price-controlled rice was sold at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road yesterday. Due to the large number of people, the police specially dispatched armored vehicles to guard the area, and dispatched more than 20 patrolmen to protect it. On the puppet police side, there were also 10-20 guards watching the area.</p>
<p>Number of Foreign Rice Orders Increases Greatly</p>
<p>Because the source of domestic rice is not smooth, Shanghai rice merchants have ordered foreign rice. Therefore, foreign rice shipments have been continuously arriving in Shanghai in recent days. Every day, rice merchants order from Daufu Foreign Firm and others, with numbers ranging from 7,000 to 8,000 bags. The number of foreign rice orders is often between 200,000 and 300,000 bags. Moreover, with the recent stabilization of China's financial situation and the easing of foreign exchange, orders for foreign rice will become more enthusiastic. Because foreign rice accounts for 70-80%, rice prices can be stabilized.</p>
<p>Adjustment Association Prepares to Order Rice</p>
<p>At the first board meeting held on the 21st, the Shanghai Citizens' Food Adjustment Association elected Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiqing, Guo Shunpei, Pei Yunqing, Wu Yunzhai, and Wang Yuqing as executive directors, and Yu Qiaqing was elected as chairman. It is also planned to add several influential Chinese and Western figures as directors and committee members, which will be announced after discussion by the executive committee. The association's articles of association, substitute foreign rice ordering methods, and fund-raising methods have all been approved and will be printed immediately. It also pushed members to contact the Trust Department of the Jin Cheng Bank to discuss collection matters. Once all procedures are prepared, a public announcement will be made to start registration and all regulations will be announced. It is also reported that the association will convene representatives of various commercial organizations today for the first consultation in order to promote work and obtain practical benefits.</p>
<p>Foreign Media Emphasizes Free Rice Transportation</p>
<p>Foreign media reported that responsible parties claimed yesterday (the 20th) that if illegal profiteers continue their activities and rice cannot be freely transported to the city from rice-producing areas, Shanghai will face a constant "rice crisis." These sources have been cut off, and illegal profiteers, speculators, and hoarders will be rampant again. The joint announcement issued by the authorities of the two concessions has had an impact on the city. The main problem at present is to open up the channels for rice to be transported to Shanghai, and the most important thing is the channels for rice to be transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas. A reporter asked a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council whether the concession authorities had discussed the free transportation of rice through the occupied areas with the Japanese authorities. He stated that the authorities are currently in contact with those involved in this matter or those who can assist.</p>
<h3>British Consul-General to Retire, French Consul Holds Farewell Banquet, Praising Joint British-French Efforts and Wishing the British Consul-General a Safe Journey Home</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that Sir Philip, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, will soon retire and depart for England. The French Consul-General, Mr. Baurdrez, hosted a farewell banquet at his residence on Saturday evening in honor of Sir Philip. This reiterated the harmony and friendship between the British and French Consuls-General in Shanghai. The arrangement of this farewell banquet differed from usual practice, with Mr. Baurdrez being assisted by the daughter of the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme.</p>
<p>Welcoming Guests</p>
<p>Guests were received and seated, but instead of one large table, there were five tables, each decorated with fresh flowers. Sir Philip and Mr. Baurdrez were seated at the main table, with other British and French guests at the remaining four tables. After the meal, Mr. Baurdrez rose to speak, expressing his regret at Sir Philip's departure from Shanghai and wishing him a safe journey home.</p>
<p>Happy Retirement</p>
<p>Mr. Baurdrez briefly mentioned the circumstances of the banquet and how Britain and France were once again fighting side-by-side for the same cause. Sir Philip responded by thanking the French Consul-General for his hospitality, praising the competence and benevolence of the French Concession authorities, and stating that he would cherish his time in Shanghai and would never forget it, adding that this joint British-French banquet was also a most memorable occasion. Over thirty British and French guests attended.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Post Office Handles Mail: Sending, Delivery, and Transit Status; Mail Delivery Throughout the Country: Now Smooth and Without Backlog</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the areas of Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou have successively become war zones. Local post offices have been forced to retreat due to the situation. Mail sent from Shanghai to areas along the Yangtze River and the Beiyang and Nanhua lines has been interrupted. Although the Shanghai postal authorities have tried their best to clear the routes, some stagnation is unavoidable. Often, mail from Shanghai to Zhejiang takes months, causing complaints from the outside world and even accusations against postal workers. However, since the Director-General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications telegraphed the Shanghai office to find ways to improve the situation, except for some places where the situation is special, mail sent from Shanghai to various inland offices, and mail delivered or transited by the bureaus along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, are still sent directly according to the usual routes without any backlog. The reporter inquired at the post office and recorded the details of the dispatch as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Mail along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, whether light or heavy items, or small parcels, is accepted as usual, with one train running up and down each day, and postal cars attached. Large parcels are limited to parcels that can be accepted by bureaus that have resumed business. Areas north and west of Rugao in northern Jiangsu, Haian, and areas north of it are sent by train from Nanjing to Zhenjiang for transit. Areas south and east of Rugao are transported by ship. Areas east of Xuzhou on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway are transported by trains from Nanjing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and other railways. All of the above-mentioned areas accept light and heavy mail as usual.

<h3>Overseas Chinese and British and American People Support China's Gung Ho Movement; Donations from Overseas Chinese Reach 560,000 Yuan, British and American Groups and Individuals Exert Themselves to Promote It</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese are enthusiastically donating to support the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives (Gung Ho) movement, with donations already reaching 560,000 yuan. The "Ta Kung Pao" received a communication from the Gung Ho Association yesterday, stating that donations from overseas Chinese in the Philippines totaled 215,000 yuan. Mr. Lin, an overseas Chinese in Java, donated 100,000 yuan on his own. Overseas Chinese in the Straits Settlements have donated</p>
<p>Two Trucks</p>
<p>Currently used in the southwest Gung Ho movement area. Patriotic overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Singapore are striving to promote the donation of funds for the Gung Ho movement in their homeland, with a target of 500,000 yuan. At the same time, groups and individuals in friendly countries are also enthusiastically supporting the Chinese Gung Ho movement, especially in</p>
<p>Britain and America</p>
<p>Mr. Alfred Barnes, a member of the British Parliament, and Mr. Xia Jinlin, a well-known Chinese writer now in London, jointly organized the Sino-British Cooperation Promotion Association. It is said that if the European war had not broken out, the association's plan to raise 100,000 pounds of British funds to lend to the Chinese Gung Ho Association would have</p>
<p>Been successful</p>
<p>The loan sought by the association was intended to purchase production machinery and transport it throughout China, with the Gung Ho Association using the products exported to Britain to repay the loan. As for the American people, they also feel</p>
<p>Great interest</p>
<p>In the progress of the Chinese Gung Ho movement. Because Chinese visitors to the United States and American missionaries returning home on leave are automatically giving speeches in the United States describing the current situation of the progress of Chinese Gung Ho, especially Ms. Ida Pruitt of the Department of Social Work at Peking Union Medical College, who left China before April and traveled through</p>
<p>Major Cities</p>
<p>In the United States to give speeches for the Chinese Gung Ho Association. The communication also stated that the Chinese industrial cooperative movement is now divided into five regions: (1) Sichuan-Xikang region, (2) Northwest region, (3) Southwest region, (4) Yunnan region, and (5) Southeast region. 1,300 teams have already been established.</p>
<h3>Domestic Remittances: Reduce Exchange Rates; Exchange Rates Should Be Uniform Among All Commercial Banks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that domestic remittances are one of the important businesses of banks, and exchange fees should be reduced as much as possible to facilitate smooth flow, so as to invigorate finance and promote economic development. Since the outbreak of the war, the exchange rates for domestic remittances among commercial banks have been inconsistent. Although this is due to various factors such as transportation, the number of fees charged by each bank has affected the convenience of merchants and the purpose of invigorating finance. In order to correct this, the ministry has now approved temporary measures to facilitate domestic remittances and sent a letter to the Joint Office of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) to instruct their branches across the country to comply. It has also issued a circular to all commercial banks in the country, stating that in the future, the exchange rates for domestic remittances should be determined jointly by local banks based on the distance and cost of the journey, and a list of the exchange rates for remittances to various important cities in the country should be displayed in front of the remittance office in the bank so that remitters can know the rates at any time. At the same time, the remittance rate table and any changes should be reported to the ministry each month for verification.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Commander Haultain Promoted: From Rear Admiral to Vice Admiral</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Haultain, Commander of the British Yangtze Fleet, recently received instructions from the Admiralty, stating that during his tenure, which coincided with the Sino-Japanese War, he made many contributions to river defense and spared no effort to protect overseas Chinese. He was specially ordered to be promoted to the rank of Vice Admiral. Mr. Haultain was ordered to officially take office on the 15th of this month and be promoted to the position of Vice Admiral.</p>
<h3>Pastor DeKruyter, Arrested by the Japanese, Returns to Shanghai: He Did Not Know the Seriousness of the Current Situation in Japan; Dispute Arose from Distributing Printed Materials</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that Pastor DeKruyter, secretary of the Far East branch of the World Student Christian Federation, distributed Christian printed materials in Japan. The Japanese authorities believed that these printed materials could promote "dangerous ideas" and detained Mr. DeKruyter. He was subsequently given a suspended sentence and left Japan on the "Taiyo Maru" and arrived in Shanghai today (the 21st). Mrs. DeKruyter and her children greeted him at the customs dock. Mr. DeKruyter told reporters,</p>
<p>"I am returning to Shanghai."</p>
<p>"I am of course much relieved. Apparently, the Japanese police had the right to arrest me for committing an illegal act. I was detained for distributing printed materials, not for speaking. And the printed materials are solid evidence. As for the nature of the printed materials, it is not convenient to discuss, but they are obviously defensive for the maintenance of law and order in Japan. At that time, I did not know that it was illegal and did it unintentionally. But in fact, I had violated two laws, one being the provision in the Army and Navy Law that prohibits the dissemination of</p>
<p>False News</p>
<p>And rumors, and the other being one of the emergency laws, namely, not to distribute "disruptive printed materials." I know that I have committed a crime, and of course I regret it very much. My difficulty lies in not knowing the seriousness of the current situation in Japan. In this critical moment, the government must do its best to maintain unity and support the government's policies. They have repeatedly</p>
<p>Explained</p>
<p>This to me, so it is necessary to prohibit various disruptive printed materials. I was arrested on October 12 and sentenced to four months imprisonment with a one-year suspended sentence on the 16th of this month before being released and gaining complete freedom. If I do not commit a crime again by the end of the year, the judgment will be automatically revoked. During</p>
<p>The Period of Detention</p>
<p>I did not encounter any difficulties or oppression except once. Usually, criminals are escorted out of the police station and into prison, but I was detained at the police station for 51 days, then handed over to the custody of the American Consul General and allowed to choose a hotel to stay in at will. The treatment I received during my detention was quite good." According to Mr. DeKruyter, he has not yet decided on his future plans but intends to stay in Shanghai for a few months.</p>

<h3>British Ship Illegally Detained by Japanese, Then Released</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that at about 10:30 a.m. yesterday (the 20th), a cargo ship carrying scrap iron was sailing up the Huangpu River when a Japanese soldier arrived in a naval speedboat, boarded the ship, and ordered it to berth at the Waterfront Hotel on the Bund. The Shanghai Municipal Police were informed and immediately negotiated with the Japanese authorities for the release of the ship, as the scrap iron was British property. After the Japanese learned that the scrap iron belonged to Messrs. Mahler &amp; Co. and checked the official customs permit, they immediately released the ship.</p>

<h3>Tang Xiuying Sued for Fraud: Trial Continued Yesterday, Further Investigation Required</h3>
<p>Tang Xiuying, wife of Wei Xinglin, resident of No. 2, Gengyuli, Bubbling Well Road, French Concession, and her elder brother, Tang Jian, allegedly used the false sale of official positions to deceive their fellow villagers Wu Zhenhua, Fang Youcheng, Lou Zhengmin, Yang Zhishan, etc., claiming that the Jianghai Customs planned to set up six posts in the occupied areas to recruit inspectors with a monthly salary of 120 yuan, but they had to pay a 300 yuan activity fee in advance. Wu Zhenhua and others believed it to be true and paid the activity fee. It was not until the 17th of last month that Wu and others realized they had been deceived and reported it to the police, who arrested Tang Xiuying and sent her to the Second Special Court for prosecution on charges of fraud.

<h3>Public Concessions All Public Toilets Yesterday Appealed to All Sectors and Requested the Bureau of Works to Directly Contract</h3>
<p>There are currently more than one hundred public toilets in the Public Concession. These public toilets have been contracted by large contractors, and then by small contractors. Each toilet pit employs workers for management, which has been the case for more than ten years. In the past, the contracting fee was only a few hundred yuan per month, but it has gradually increased. Currently, it has increased to a huge amount of seven thousand yuan. The daily income of small contractors relies entirely on toilet paper fees. Recently, due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, everything has become expensive. Each toilet pit feels it is difficult to maintain. Moreover, since the cost of living has increased, the population has greatly dispersed, and the number of people using public toilets has also decreased, resulting in a decrease in income. Small contractors are already very panicked. Unexpectedly, recently the Bureau of Works opened bids for public toilets, and the bidder was the Oriental Cleaning Company, which won the bid with the highest price of 15,180 yuan, exceeding the past contracting fee of 7,000 yuan by more than double. Therefore, all the small contractors were shocked. Because the large contractor has contracted at a high price, it will inevitably increase the contracting fee for small contractors. On the one hand, the current fee for toilet paper is only one cent, and it cannot be increased to two cents to increase income. Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, all the small contractors have jointly petitioned the Bureau of Works to find a way to maintain the situation, or allow them to directly contract, so as to avoid separation. Currently, they have already filed a petition once. It is learned that yesterday all the small contractors again appealed to organizations such as the Chinese Ratepayers Association and all sectors for relief.</p>
<h3>Kang Yi Lane Rent Increase Dispute Resolved Tenants to Appropriately Increase Water Fees</h3>
<p>The houses in Kang Yi Lane, Kang Ti Road, in the French Concession, are the property of the Zhu family, and are managed by the Ji Yi Real Estate Company. Recently, the landlord notified all tenants that due to the increase in water and electricity, the rent would be increased by 30% starting from October of this year. If they did not agree, they would have to move out of the house within one month. All the tenants believed that during this extraordinary period, a huge rent increase was difficult to bear, so they specifically requested the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to uphold justice and find a way to stop it. It is learned that the case has been forwarded by the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association to the landlord, requesting consideration of the current difficulties and exemption from the increase. Yesterday, the association also convened representatives from both parties to discuss the matter. As a result, the water surcharge was appropriately increased, and the matter has been peacefully resolved.</p>
<h3>Xinmin Village Deadline for Rent Increase Tenants Extremely Angry Advocate for Serious Negotiations</h3>
<p>The landlord of the houses in Xinmin Village, Ma Lang Road, is Qian Yiru, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou who is currently the assistant manager of the Trust Department of the Continental Bank. Recently, he wanted to increase the rent, but before discussing and deciding with the tenants, he suddenly ordered the rental accountant to notify the tenants on the day before yesterday (the 20th) that the water fee would be increased by eight yuan per building per month, and that they had to agree by the 27th of this month, otherwise the water supply would be stopped. Most of the tenants in the village have lived there for about ten years, and the rent has been paid on a monthly basis. Now, during this time of national crisis, Mr. Qian disregards the difficulties of the tenants and threatens to cut off the water supply. All the tenants are extremely angry, and unanimously advocate for refusal and serious negotiations.</p>
<h3>Fire This Morning</h3>
<p>At about 0:21 this morning, a fire broke out at No. 7, Lane 58, at the intersection of Bali Bridge Street and Avenue Edward VII in the French and Boundary area. The flames soared into the sky. Later, the French Concession Fire Brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire. Because the fire was very fierce, it was not easy to extinguish for a while. As of the time this newspaper went to press, it had not yet been extinguished. Details will be reported later.</p>

At the same time, two more bandits were captured after a chase. The escaped bandits were immediately detained in the police station. The injured bandit was sent to Guangci Hospital. According to the confession of one of the captured bandits, they had committed a robbery at the same tin foil shop in April of this year, and this was the second time.</p>

<h3>On Increasing Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Due to the high cost of everything and increased expenses, some private schools in Shanghai had already increased their tuition fees once in the second semester of this year. However, in recent months, the rise in prices has continued without limit, causing the expenses of various schools to exceed their budgets again. Under these circumstances, it is said that many private schools will increase tuition fees again after the winter vacation ends and school starts in the new year. Schools are increasing tuition fees amidst the soaring prices to cover their huge expenses, and we certainly cannot criticize them for this. However, on the other hand, we cannot ignore whether parents can bear the increased burden of their children's education.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, many private schools in Shanghai already charge tuition fees that are not considered low. Even without an increase, under today's circumstances, most parents will find it difficult to bear the burden. How much more so with repeated increases, which will force children in school to drop out midway! Among the salaried class in the city, how many have a monthly income of more than one hundred yuan? Under today's circumstances, can those with incomes below one hundred yuan spare a portion for their children's tuition fees? They know that when their children reach school age, they should send them to school, but without money, they cannot enter school and can only watch their children be deprived of an education. Isn't it contrary to the purpose of education to increase the number of children who drop out of school due to increased tuition fees?</p>
<p>Here, we are not saying that we do not sympathize with school principals incurring debts due to increased tuition fees. What we hope is that all those who run education in the city can do so for the sake of education. Each school should consider the issue of increasing tuition fees according to its own economic situation. It would be best not to increase tuition fees at all, and if an increase is necessary, it should be kept to the lowest possible extent. Everyone knows that after "August 13th," many private schools in Shanghai indeed had more money. Running a school is not like running a business where one must make money every day and accumulate wealth every year, and tuition fees should not be raised recklessly.</p>
<p>As for some schools that can maintain operations even without an increase, it is even more unreasonable to want to increase tuition fees. One must know that this is not the time to get rich, and it is especially inappropriate to want to get rich by running a school. In short, weigh the pros and cons, save on unnecessary expenses, and if an increase in fees is truly unavoidable, it should be kept within reasonable limits. This is, after all, an era of hardship! Otherwise, we will only lead Shanghai's education down the path of destruction!</p>

<h3>Strange Crow? Black Insect? - Originally Wild Ducks?</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>According to the local newspaper on the 14th, it was reported that at dawn on the 11th, tens of millions of birds resembling swans or geese flew over the city. However, according to someone who came from Hongkou yesterday, he said that on the morning of the 11th, he saw millions of black flying insects in Hongkou, forming a group like a black cloud, covering an area of more than twenty feet, flying over Hongkou, and their whereabouts are unknown. However, no one can know what these black insects are. According to a guest from Jinshan yesterday, it is enough to prove that what is called a black cloud is not a black insect, but a flock of wild ducks, and its damage to crops can be said to be shocking news for hundreds of years. I record it as follows:</p>
<p>According to a guest from Jinshan yesterday, he said: On the evening of the 10th, the villagers in a certain place were lying in bed when they suddenly heard a loud noise from the northwest, like a storm, surging and roaring, with the勢of overturning mountains and seas. The villagers thought that a strong wind had suddenly arrived, which was a sign that the weather was about to turn cold, so they did not think it was strange. When they opened the door to inspect in the morning, they were greatly shocked, because dozens of acres of rice had been completely lost. At that time, although the rice had been harvested, it was still in the field, and it was not known whether it had been stolen by someone or eaten by some kind of animal. However, if it had been stolen by someone, it would never have been so completely gone. Therefore, those who lost their rice all cried bitterly, while those who had not suffered losses were thankful that they had escaped.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, that night, a strong wind rose again, and the villagers were greatly shocked. The villagers in the tens of miles around all got up holding poles and sticks, and saw that the fields were full of wild ducks, no less than tens of millions, creeping and moving. The villagers hit them with sticks, but they did not fly away, only making a grunting sound, slightly avoiding the villagers' blows. After a long time, one flew up, and then the group flew away, as if there was a leader. Afterwards, the villagers captured the ducks, some of whom had been injured, and some who had not been injured, no less than several hundred. The area damaged the next night was larger than what was eaten the night before, covering no less than a hundred acres. People in the city who saw them bought one and cooked it, and it was no different from the wild ducks bought on the market. The third night, the villagers waited with sticks, but they never came again.</p>
<p>Wild ducks harming rice fields is a rare event in thousands of years. However, according to people, these wild ducks mainly come from Taihu Lake, because there are always hunters who go to Taihu Lake to hunt ducks, especially in winter, to make a living. Since the outbreak of the war, hunters have not dared to go, and these wild ducks have been breeding very rapidly. Recently, due to overproduction, they have vigorously carried out their colonization policy, and thus harmed the crops.</p>
<p>However, I have several doubts: (1) Wild ducks in Taihu Lake have existed for a long time, and I have never heard of them affecting rice fields. Even in places like West Lake, there are also these things, and I have never heard of them damaging rice fields. Why is it that they cause such severe damage to rice fields? This is the first thing that is doubtful. (2) Wild ducks damaging rice is rarely heard of. Even if it happens, why don't they damage the rice in the nearby fields, but fly hundreds of miles away to harm the rice in Jinshan? This is the second thing that is doubtful. (3) Are wild ducks collective animals? Assuming one duck does not fly and is hit, would it rather die than leave? This is the third thing that is doubtful. This wild duck damaging rice is really an unprecedented strange event. I write this now to provide it to scientists for research.</p>
<h3>After the Rain Comes Sunshine</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19 Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon Activities Lead to a Family, Planting Jade and Nurturing Pearls Conveys the Art of Pregnancy</p>
<p>Now let's talk about this honeymoon trip. Yu Danyun meant that it would be best to rest for a few days without taking any trips. Or, if there was an opportunity, she would simply take a leave next spring and travel abroad with her husband. It would be best if they could travel around the world in a week and see the new progress in the world. However, this expense would be relatively large, so it would be better for the two of them to start saving now, and if there was not enough, they could discuss it with Mrs. Su Liya. She had this idea, and fortunately, Lin Jiancheng obeyed Yu Danyun's every command. If she was happy to travel, he would naturally accompany her. If she was not happy to travel, he would not force her to go. However, the car manufacturing company run by Mrs. Su Liya had already manufactured several types of cars for family travel, which were to be tested during Yu Danyun's honeymoon trip. Previously, Mrs. Su Liya had originally wanted to specially make a family car and give it to the new couple as a gift, but Yu Danyun declined. She said, "They both have careers and each is busy with their own affairs. How could they have the time to travel? If it's just a honeymoon trip, it's just a one-time trip during the honeymoon. It would be a pity if that car was left unused after that." In order to thank Mrs. Su Langya for her kindness, she was willing to borrow one of the newly made family travel cars after the wedding to travel around and visit various places. There were three new styles of family travel cars. A few days ago, Mrs. Su Liya asked someone to drive them over and let Jin Danyun choose. Jin Huyun said, "Since we are testing the cars, let's test all three cars." These family travel cars were well-equipped. The cars had exquisite electric lights and were also equipped with wireless radios, so they could listen to news and music from various places. Inside, there was a folding mandarin duck bed, which could be separated or combined, making it perfect for newlyweds. With a twist of a switch, it could be folded up and immediately turned into a living room, and the mandarin duck bed would become a sofa chair. At the back of the car, there was a small kitchen equipped with an electric stove, so you could cook your own food as long as you had fish, meat, vegetables, and fruits ready. The small kitchen also had an electric refrigerator, so even in the summer, it was very convenient to eat some iced snow pears and drink some iced soda. Although it was a small kitchen, it could prepare food and drink for three or four passengers. In addition to the small kitchen, there was also a bathroom with water pipes that led to the roof of the car, where a water tank was installed. Because now there are tap water pipes everywhere in China, and there are water towers everywhere on the highways, it is very convenient to get water. Therefore, the bathroom was also equipped with a bathtub, which was made of leather and could be folded up when not in use, which was very ingenious.</p>

<h3>Odds and Ends of Christmas (Street Gleanings)</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Night has fallen, and the lights are as bright as a painting. Dragging heavy steps, I shuffle through the streets, as slow as a wild beast trapped in a cage.</p>
<p>The bustling, crowded shop windows compete to tell me something, as if showing off their respective craftsmanship. But, if judged with a discerning eye, how vulgar and clumsy they are! Fat village women in heavy makeup. In fact, it's still that same old trick: "Christmas gifts."</p>
<p>The residents under this same blue sky are moving toward two extremes day by day: extravagant decadence is one world, and poverty, freezing, and starvation are another. Looking at the customers coming and going in the stores like a shuttle, you would never believe that on the same day, in different corners, more than thirty cases of rice robbery occurred.</p>
<p>Noble gentlemen and elegant ladies emerge from the doors of hotels; haggard, ragged vagrants stretch out dog-claw-like black hands. Contempt answers the plea. Disappearing into the night wind are satisfied belches and cries of hunger.</p>
<p>Kind-faced, white-haired old men and trees adorned with snowflakes are indispensable embellishments of Christmas. These are probably symbols of peace and happiness? At first glance, they make you feel a kind of joy involuntarily. Who doesn't love that beautiful and clean picture?</p>
<p>But, in this year when even the goddess of peace is crying, I rather doubt whether Santa Claus can still force a smile. Seeing this vast human tragedy, can the old man not cry in sorrow? Moreover, where is there such a tranquil garden? It is a bloody age!</p>
<p>Another seasonal gadget parades before me: greeting cards of different colors, different patterns, different forms, filling a window. They are used to wish friends happiness. The intention is naturally good, but unfortunately, it is too unfair. The cost of one card could sustain another group of people for several days! Moreover, happiness mostly slips away from the fingers of those holding the cards.</p>
<p>The shop windows continue to show off their charm, but I no longer have the mood to stroll.</p>
<h3>The Birth of Jesus and Society</h3>
<p>(III) To Comfort the Sorrowful? Christmas is the expression of eternal joy. The songs of the angels are so jubilant, and the good news they convey is so joyful. These all symbolize world peace, the so-called era of Yao and Shun is about to arrive, that is, the so-called "Kingdom of Heaven is near." The people who are in poverty, sickness, and prison, hear this sound, and are all overjoyed, eagerly anticipating the coming of this great Jubilee year. Jesus said: "Do not be afraid," "Do not be sad," I give you peace, my own peace, so that your joy may be fulfilled, even forever." Therefore, every Christmas, Christians always rush about, and try their best to make the sorrowful get the joy of universal celebration. (IV) To Bring Light to the Darkness? All the people who dwell in the dark and dead land, will see the true light shining, leading them under the broad daylight. Jesus said, I come to the world, is the light of the world, those who follow me, will not dwell in darkness, and will surely obtain the light of life. Jesus opened the eyes of the blind, verifying that He is the light of life. Truth is light, conscience is the eye. When conscience is dim, truth is unclear, is the greatest darkness, the mind and personality, will certainly fall, creating a dark world, floating and murderous, treacherous deception, looting extortion, suppression, corruption, aggression, superstition, etc. are all the evil results produced by the darkness of the human heart. Just look at the results of the war? What gifts do the gods of war give to people? How can pen and ink describe it? It is rare for Jesus's true light to shine strongly, breaking the power of darkness, and seeing the true light of the Kingdom of Heaven again.

<h3>Gleanings from the Opera Stage</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the people in the Public Concession were addicted to opera, and Empress Dowager Cixi was even known as an opera fan. The inner court was filled with music and singing every day, and she also ordered skilled craftsmen to create various stage sets that matched the plot to adjust the monotony of the stage background. From then on, scene operas became popular in various theaters. According to research, scene operas already existed in the Ming Dynasty. For example, Zhang Dai's "Tao Guang'an Reminiscence" mentions the women's opera of Liu Huiji: "Liu Huiji had strange fantasies and wanted to make up for the shortcomings of the opera world. For example, when Emperor Ming of Tang traveled to the Moon Palace and Ye Fashan performed magic, the stage was suddenly dark and the ground was dark. When the hand rose and the sword fell, with a thunderous sound, the black curtain suddenly closed, revealing a moon, which was as round as a compass. The four sides were dyed with five-color clouds made of sheep horns, and in the middle sat Chang'e, with a cassia tree and Wu Gang pounding medicine, Inside the light gauze, several moonlights were lit, and the light was as green as a dawn, shooting out to form beams, thus stepping into the moon's cave, the scene was magical, forgetting that it was a play." It can be seen that the scene operas in the Ming Dynasty were already quite ingenious. Today's Shanghai-style local operas take novelty in scenery as their ability, and this should be regarded as the origin.</p>
<p>It is rare to find female performers with martial arts skills among Kun operas. This is limited by natural talent, and there is nothing that can be done about it. However, when Kun operas first flourished at the end of the Qing Dynasty, there were countless Yingying Wanyan performers among the male and female roles, competing for a seat with the men. Martial male roles such as Chen Changgeng of the Chen Family Troupe, who performed "Changban Slope," "Jiepai Pass," "Four Heroes Village," and "Luoma Lake," were extremely agile in their skills, whether they were wearing long armor or short clothing. They were famous wherever they went in Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangdong. There was also Yun Jinhong, who was able to perform many operas, and was skilled in tumbling and falling. Her voice was loud and pleasant to listen to. Not only was she rare in the Southern Troupe, but she could also be called outstanding among the martial male roles in the Northern Troupe. At the end of the Guangxu period, there was Zhou Fubao in the theaters of the capital, who was famous for performing the role of Sun Wukong. She could perform dozens of somersaults on a steel pole and could perform sixty or seventy spins in the middle of the stage without blushing or panting. At first, no one knew that she was a female. As for male roles, there were En Xiaofeng and Chen Huifeng, whose voices were high and melodious, and whose words were accurate and round. Whether singing or acting, they were both exemplary. Among the painted-face roles, there was Jin Chu, who was famous in the world for his black head. His voice was loud and clear, almost surpassing the seat of Xiu Shan. His thunderous singing in "Exploring the Yin Mountain" and "Entering the Palace Twice" also had unique merits. As for the clown roles, there was Xie Shaolan. Although he was not a true clown, his language was clumsy and straightforward, his appearance was hateful, and his posture often made people laugh. He was also able to attract attention for a while. As for today, apart from the female roles, there are few roles that do not have the sigh of lack of talent, let alone martial arts. Even Meng Xiaodong, who is famous in the opera world for her male role, is comparable to Shu Yan, and is as rare as a phoenix feather or unicorn horn!</p>
<p>When I was young, I watched puppet shows (that is, marionette shows) and felt that the ingenuity of the performers was beyond reach. When performing, the performers pulled the strings and sang behind the curtain, and the puppets on the stage moved and posed in harmony with the music. It was like being in a dance hall, with melodious singing and the sound of Sheng and reed instruments. In recent years, they have gradually become rare. Most of those who do this profession are down-and-out actors, so the operas they perform are all very realistic. When these people were on the red carpet, performing in makeup, how could they not attract attention for a while? When they become old and their beauty fades, they cannot avoid making a living by using puppets. It is also sad! At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zhou Liangong wrote to He Juede: "When I was young, I saw puppet shows, which were about two feet long, with many threads, and were manipulated by people. Recently, they have been reduced to a few inches in size and pushed with wooden boards. They look like people who are using their own intelligence. Alas! The puppets are also getting smaller and smaller, and they are not controlled by human threads, but want to use their own intelligence. How terrible and sad!" Thinking about the past, I can't help but sigh!</p>
<h3>Random Chat About Christmas and the Performing Arts</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Christmas is almost here again. In European and American countries, almost everyone, young and old, celebrates this holiday with great enthusiasm. Movie theaters, dance halls, nightclubs – all are packed. People shout, cheer, eat, and play, almost forgetting all the troubles and unhappiness they’ve encountered throughout the year.</p>
<p>Indeed, Christmas is inseparable from entertainment. Look, in fact, countless entertainers are going crazy for Christmas. They are all happy to decorate this carnival as grandly as the New Year.</p>
<p>The movies released in theaters for Christmas are mostly the best, either grand and magnificent or with intricate plots, or light and joyful. To accommodate the excessive number of viewers, they are prepared to add extra screenings at 11:00 AM or 11:00 PM. Some even specially select several precious, colorful short films to be shown before the main feature. In Hollywood, of course, the situation is even more lively. Gift-giving, sending Christmas cards, gathering for banquets…it truly is a case of "the city never sleeps," so lively that nothing can compare.</p>
<p>Next, the dance halls are quite lively. Almost every one is open all night, and they have specially prepared a variety of novel entertainment programs to be performed during Christmas. In addition, there are things like "Christmas menus," "Christmas white hat cakes"... everything takes on a new look because of Christmas. The interiors of the dance halls are decorated with colorful decorations, and the dancers have also prepared new outfits, permed their hair, and are ready to show off when Christmas arrives. Therefore, for Christmas in the dance halls, it is truly unknown how much money is spent.</p>
<p>The Shanghai performing arts scene will naturally be no exception. During Christmas, they will become even more active, making big preparations to rush business and make money. Whether it's theaters, dance halls, or broadcasting... everyone is scrambling to prepare special Christmas programs. These programs must be the best and most able to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>Christmas is a carnival. If we could carefully calculate the money spent that day, we would definitely find that the amount is astonishing!</p>
<p>"Save the nation without forgetting entertainment, entertain without forgetting saving the nation!" Although these two sentences are somewhat outdated, I think everyone needs to practice them earnestly at present. Entertainment, in some ways, is certainly very important, but in any case, at this time and place in Shanghai, every citizen should not waste too much money on so-called "celebration." When we are entertained, we should think of the brave soldiers fighting on the front lines and the displaced people wandering the streets without clothes or food, and therefore save some money to use as winter clothing allowances and do some good deeds. Then, celebrating Christmas in this way will feel even more meaningful.</p>
<h3>Microscopic Time-Lapse Photography – A Powerful Tool for Educational Films</h3>
<p>— Yan Chengxi</p>
<p>Recently, the laboratory at New York University in the United States used microscopic time-lapse photography, placing a camera in front of a microscope to capture footage. The setup is very sophisticated, capable of rapidly displaying extremely slow movements, greatly assisting in the research of cancer and other terrifying diseases. For example, the process of a flower blooming, the state of plant growth, and the activity of pathogens can all be captured. Dr. Robert Chambers of the university and others have applied this technology to express the slow unfolding of microorganisms and human tissues in a short period of time, creating films. It enables the performance of microbial activity that is invisible to the naked eye and changes that usually take several days or weeks, in just a few minutes, making a great contribution to education. In recent years, our government has produced educational films. If we can research and improve and use this method, the benefit to education will be significant.</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Little Miss Broadway</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>We have seen too many movies depicting the stupidity, baseness, cruelty, and tyranny of indigenous people; and how white soldiers bravely defeated them is also always the same. The conclusion reached is: such stupid, cruel nations should perish! "Little Miss Broadway," however, is relatively moderate. It makes an indigenous chief willing to reconcile with white people and stop killing each other, but behind the screen, there is also a condition attached: the indigenous people tacitly acknowledge that they are vassals of the white people.</p>
<p>Because "Little Miss Broadway" stars Shirley Temple, the screenwriter even uses the friendship between Shirley and the young chief to inspire the indigenous people to "be brave enough to change" with childlike innocence. In fact, what is the difference between this and "Gunga Din"?</p>
<p>As for the director, the entire film unfolds in a straightforward manner. Besides fully depicting the stupidity and cruelty of the indigenous people, there is no achievement worth mentioning. Even the so-called "battle" scene where the indigenous people attack the mounted police lacks clarity in its weaving and cannot show a state of tension.</p>
<p>Of Shirley Temple's films, I feel that "Heidi" is the most satisfying, because this play allows her to fully display her acting skills. "Little Miss Broadway" doesn't have any special achievements, but it doesn't make people dislike it, like some of her past films. Shirley also has a shortcoming, which is that the position of her eyebrows and eyes is too close. When making a worried expression, her eyebrows and eyes squeeze together even more. In this way, her worry seems very "contrived," and the director happened to use two "close-up" shots here.</p>
<h3>Storm Over the Border</h3>
<p>Performed in Yunnan</p>
<p>The Central Film Studio Troupe performed the four-act play "Storm Over the Border" in Yunnan on the seventh of this month. The actors included Bai Yang, Gu Er’yi, Wei Heling, and the director was Shen Xiling.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei also came to Kunming with the Central Film Studio’s location shooting crew, but did not participate in this performance. (Note: "Storm Over the Border" was written by Yang Hansheng, depicting the Mongolian and Han people eliminating private grievances and working together to resist foreign aggression under the banner of national liberation. It was serialized in the anti-Japanese drama published in Hankou and was widely circulated.)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Several Amateur Opera Enthusiasts in the Banking Industry</p>
<p>(1) The person who could make Shu Yan afraid of him was originally a petty patrol officer in the Public Security Bureau. As the saying goes, "Not afraid of officials, only afraid of those in charge." This petty patrol officer, although only a small head among several policemen, just happened to be in charge of the Chunshu Hutong area. Since Shu Yan had an addiction, this patrol officer could use this to coerce him, sending Shu Yan a card today (for matters such as weddings, funerals, celebrations, and a child's first month), asking him to write a list of donors tomorrow, and even asking him for benefits during the New Year and festivals. He simply gave Shu Yan a headache, but fearing to offend him, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and endure it. The most ridiculous thing was that some wealthy merchants in Beiping held private performances at home and asked some respectable people to invite Shu Yan to join in the performance, but he could decline on the grounds of illness. Later, some mischievous people simply asked a certain patrol officer to speak to Shu Yan. Although Shu Yan could still decline in the same way, he always had to say a lot of nice things to this patrol officer, or else he had to send him a few coins in private to settle the matter. Therefore, this patrol officer had enjoyed quite a bit of benefit from Shu Yan for many years (the patrol officers and patrol officials in Beiping were usually not transferred for more than ten years). (2) The person who looked down on Shu Yan the most was not an outsider, but his younger brother, Yu Shengsun. This person has the nickname "Yu the Madman." The two brothers never visited each other (i.e., did not associate). He looked down on his older brother for a reason. Here, let me first describe Shengsun's history, and we can know that he also had his reasons for looking down on his older brother. Twenty years ago, Shengsun studied the Cheng style (Cheng Changgeng style) from Mr. Zhou Ziheng, a broker at the Tongrentang pharmacy. The owner of the pharmacy, Mr. Le, owned a large fortune and was a connoisseur of Peking opera. He often hosted famous actors from the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods and general dignitaries at his home, and the sounds of singing and dancing never ceased all night. (165) Miss Murong Wan'er, the female lead of "Master," is a talented student from a certain university who is known for performing the dance-drama "Regret of the Ming Dynasty" and is now a newcomer at Minhua Company.</p>
