<h3>滙市劇變中之上海</h3>
<p>上海滙市自七日上午發生劇變之後，昨日自朝至暮，復繼續下降之不已，逐步皆成新低價。雖重慶與香港乃至於倫敦，各有確鑿電訊，足資證明法幣基礎之絕無問題；同時，各方輿情，亦類能體認此項劇變，並非不可抗之意外，而爲計畫的措施，且別有其必要之意義；然人心在盲目浮動之際，自難期以接受理智而遽歸寗靜：金融繫於實力，顧每一片段之波紋，則輒受人心重大影響，此中外一例而不必駭異者也。若怵於目前逐步下降之空氣，疑爲一往不復，無所底止之朕兆，是誠短視；若更隨波逐流，爭先恐後，而以取得若干外匯爲得計，則黑市投機操縱之徒，最所倒屣相迎，此固自投羅綱，彼則趁火打刼；法幣基礎無虞乎因此動搖，然滙市劇變則將因此而增加其嚴重；夫以短視盲目而自耗其資力，事屬可憐不足恤，詎不寃乎？</p>
<p>平心而論：中國以生產落後之國家，掙扎於資本主義所支配之國際；生活所需旣無以自給，自衛所需必購求域外，乃作戰迄今歷二十四月，而債券猶能維持其水準，物價猶未過度之高昂，幣値僅低减如今茲；凡此現象，可謂難能而可貴；此則內而朝野同心協力，外而友邦同情協助所致，決非偶然也。今則戰局已由「下風」轉變入於相持不下之膠着狀態，補充軍實以反攻制勝之條件亦漸决周備，淪陷區域人民所受慘痛，尤證明抗戰圖存之必要，國際復以利權所在，休戚攸共，而對於侵略者捐棄其姑息妥協之念，强化其反侵略之一致行動；大局之優勢，灼然可覩。法幣與國家，運命相通而不可分離者也；謂大局之優勢灼然，而法幣竟遭致命之打擊，此乃事實所必無；是以滙市劇變，不成爲悲觀之理由。抑如此滙市，雖以中國經濟之未能自給而使整個中國蒙其相當影響；然以戰綫之轉移，　由事實限制一般中國人民與國際市塲之關係；是以所蒙之滙市影響，亦由此限制而降至最低度。影響最大者，莫如上海。申言之：上海以滙市劇變而感受心理上之不安，事實上之損耗，未可象徵中國全國；亦即上海所視為嚴重者，全國不若此嚴重也。</p>
<p>上海由戰爭而形成孤島。而幻為國際特區，以戶口稠密而日常消耗奇鉅，以工業區之破壞與農產區之隔離而生機阻遏，以法幣為通貨而外滙黑市復無法管理；於是法幣滙價之漲跌，影響及於一切物價；故二三日來之現象，確已使生活於上海之任何人，不問貧富，不問國籍，直接蒙其不利。誠使一般人放任此現象之自然發展，而無改於一二年來生活之道，將使整個上海之經濟機能，向枯竭萎頓之方嚮而邁進，而其直接間接之惡果，亦必有不勝言，不堪想者。抑如之何不放任？以上海一隅之力，提高滙價，事屬萬不可能；以上海一隅之故，籲請國民政府放棄或緩弛外滙政策，則別有流弊，事屬萬不可行。是以應付此現象者，不在對外滙價而在日常生活。以生活適現象，初無獨得之秘，出奇制勝之方，惟在平凡中求之，惟在平凡中致之。按之經濟原則，目前現象原有其自然發展之趨向：由供需與利潤之關係而刺激生產一也，由物價與資力之關係而節的消耗二也。二者平凡，所貴乎在自然趨向之外，更益之以有意識之動力。在從事生產事業者，應不僅由刺激而自然發展，必認識局勢而迎頭趕上，竭智力財力以赴之。在不事生產者，必以智力財力，及時謀生產。就消費言之，以物價資力而自然不得不節的，是無待勸；然目前之事，應不僅爲物價昂貴資力不勝而節的，允必爲愛惜一己資力，顧全法幣滙價而節的。彼過度奢靡生活者，最多節的餘地，務必自此節的，允必節的有關外滙之消耗，是無待言；即在中下之家，平時似乎旣極刻苦之能事。然謂每一家，每一人，竟然更無節衣縮食餘地，猶不盡然。充極其量而言之：二盂之飯亦可不饑，何必三盂以求飽？日出而作，日入而息，何必一燈如豆？非常時期之人民生活，應母愧對戰壕中之勇士；彼爲國家，有時尙不能得漿以解渴，而生活上海者或酒或茶，乃謂節衣縮食太苦耶？</p>
<h3>津租界局勢嚴重　日向英當局重申要求　限期引渡刺程案犯　否則將截斷英租界與外界交通　日商業機關奉令準備遷出租界</h3>
<p>（天津）路透社今日從可恃方面探悉、日方因程錫庚被刺事、已以哀的美敦書送致英租界當局、重申刺程案中四犯引渡之要求、聞限兩天內照辦、吾則將完全截斷英租界與外界之交通、大的日方將以障礙物封鎖英租界各出入要道而阻任何人出入、至於食物等是吾亦在阻止之列、則言者不一其詞、綜之局勢可認爲嚴重、日僑今日在此舉行民衆大會、通過一議案、要求對於英租界施行懲戒行為、據可恃方面之消息？設於英租界之正金銀行、已奉令於六月十四日將其辦事處移至日方所估領之區域、詢諸正金銀行、未能獲得證實消息、又聞在英租界營業之日人商行數家、亦奉有同時遷出之命令、此間英當局以為現所有之證據、尙不足為引渡日方所指索的四人之理由、而日方則謂此四人犯罪有充分證據、日方近曾得英當局之同意、加以盤詰、彼等已自認與刺程案有關、且亦與聞殺死日兵三人之案件、（八日路透電）</p>

<h3>限制黑市外匯供給　係防杜日方套購　昨晨外滙率仍繼續緊縮　中央銀行法定行市未動　混亂狀態即將穩定</h3>
<p>本報八日香港專電、港各銀行八日休假、外匯無市、各銀號中購法幣者踴躍、晨市爲四七五、下午略升、金融貿易塲主席鍾達淸談、外匯管理局停售外匯、在打擊日方陰謀擾亂、無足影響華方金融基礎、港大洋價略跌、乃買家梢减之故、（八日專電）（美聯社紐的七日電）據今日此間匯兌市塲之掛脾、上海幣價下跌甚烈、其收盤價爲汁四·七五、較諸六月六日之收盤價、共低落一·四〇、聞此决華幣步降之原因、實由於香港中英平準基金管理處停止供給外匯之故、又訊、港法幣八日午收盤續跌至四六五、</p>
<p>（路透社七日倫敦電）泰晤士報評論中國貨幣穩定基金中止援助法幣八便士二五之滙率事、謂外間所傳基金大半業已喪失之謠言、殊屬荒謬、惟現已明白發現者、照最近八便士二五價格、以法幣購外匯之需求、實屬過多、不能長此應付、基金委員會乃決定與其抑低滙價、不如暫不援助滙市、而聽令自定其價格、俟相當時、基金委員會定將規定一種較低新價格、而作必要之維持、以免發生過分劇烈之波動、就中國而論、切實規定的滙率之價値、當然頗大、故新價格當可僅速實現、</p>
<p>（哈瓦斯社八日倫敦電）中國法幣因滙兌平準基金中止供給外滙之故、對英幣滙價、已自八便士二五、跌至六便士六二五、此間一般人所獲印象、咸以爲中國當局將聽任法幣達到一種水準、俾與經濟狀况相適應、必俟遇有劇烈變動時、始乃出而干涉、法幣滙價跌落之後、中國對外貿易、當可獲有良好影饗、即對外貿易之總結、亦可在某種程度內予以改善、</p>
<p>（路透社八日香港電）負責方面今日對路透社發表說明中英平準基金暫不援助法幣之理由、謂在過去數屋期內、平準基金未遭壓力、此爲衆所共知者、一般人對於法幣之信任、依然毫未動搖、惟基金於星期三日暫不予以援助、俾使法幣滙價得與更好的經濟價格相適合、而促成貿易之平衡、吾人當記得一九三八年六月間會有此同樣步驟、迨旣得八便士之價格後、滙率圓滿維持歷十二個月之久、現信新價格業已獲得、而可予以堅强的維持從前輸入之許多外貨、現正在國內自製、而農產現有豐收之望、輸入亦可减少矣、今已商妥辦法、庶政府所需之外滙、用以購置軍火與其他接濟品者、得以取用、而不入外匯市塲、平準基金旣已加强、而擴大此基金基礎之努力、亦復成功、故當局維持外滙之能力、可不發生疑問、猶有言者、法幣雖遇日前滙率之調整、然仍將享有人民之信任、以其確可隨時自由兌換也、</p>
<p>（美聯社重慶八日電）據此間金融家言、香港方面之政府官員與代表、現正利用銀行休假日、對法幣價格之下跌、作縝密之研究、新自昆明抵此之中國銀行顧問美人林丘、與中央銀行顧問楊格氏、亦皆被邀參預會議、據各方觀察、中國之貨幣機構、根本上並無錯誤之處、故今决法幣之跌價、大抵由於日方套取外滙所致、若干方面、承諷中國目前對外貿易之不利、或亦爲原因之一、但皆認中國之平準基金決不至於用罄、</p>
<p>（美聯社東京八日電）今日此間之證券市價、因聞中國法幣價格低落、莫不大漲特漲、各項證券平均漲二十三磅音、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）本市前昨兩日、因匯豐銀行限制供給黑市塲外匯、致外匯緊縮、金價突呈劇變、記者昨據金融界消息、謂此項現象、預料即可打開新局面、就國富觀點言、滬上近來外匯消耗、月有增加、即以海關貿易論亦形成入超、逐月增加、但此點尙非外匯緊縮之主要原因、此决措施之着眼點、殆以日方近來亟謀吸收法幣、以之套取外匯後、不予重新部署、自足爲中國經濟上之損失、此决限制黑市塲外匯、實爲杜絕套取外匯之有效辦法、至於中央銀行法定行市、屹然未動、一般傳中政府將有新辦法公布、昨據本埠中央銀行消息、現尙未奉到命令、據金融界人士稱、中央銀行之法定行市、當不致變動、如中政府準備公布新辦法之說果屬不虛、則其重心、當在香港平準外匯基金會矣、</p>
<p>平準委會穩定外滙</p>
<p>中國政府向英商滙豐·麥加利·及中國·交通·等四銀行、成立一千萬英鎊借款、設立平準外滙基金委員會、擇定香港爲外滙基金平準運用地點、該委員會之使命爲隨時設法平穩英鎊法幣比率之差度、自實施之後、中國外滙、愈趨穩定、並為社絕投機者之操縱、當投機家拋出時、政府買進、投機家收進時、政府賣出、使投機家失其操縱力量、此項任務、非政府所能擔任、必須委任之於銀行、於是上海黑市塲之外匯、亦趨穩定、</p>
<p>防止日方套取外滙</p>
<p>自實施統制外匯之後、指定中央銀行辦理各業及私人申請法定外滙事宜、中國交通辦理土貨出口結售外滙事宜、今鑒於上海黑市塲之外滙、並非爲中國獨有、世界各國都有、不過中國之黑市塲情形特殊、比較難以取締、自「華興」鈔票發行之後、竟鉅量收買中國法幣、企圖套取外滙、同時上海口岸之入超數字增加、以致鉅額外滙漏巵、政府因權力不及、無法消除入超、故不得不另籌應付、防止日方之套取外滙、</p>
<p>黑市外滙限制供給英商滙豐·麥加利。等銀行、於七日晨起得香港電、突限制供給黑市塲之外滙、以致一般投機者紛紛扒進、造成黑市塲外匯之空前緊縮、洋貨市塲、一切交易混亂、紗市等國貨價格、隨之飛漲、允其現金市塲飛漲、漫無止境、同時金融市塲謠言蠭起、並牽涉幣制問題、但是項謠言、均不可靠、蓋政府維持幣制、早有最大決心、况施行以來、頗收成效、外商銀行之限制供給外滙、與整個幣制政策、毫不相關、</p>
<p>正當需用仍予供給</p>
<p>滙豐等銀行限制供給黑市塲外滙之後、聞規定以後凡正當商人、因無法向中央銀行申請法定外滙、轉向外商銀行購買外滙、仍予無限制之供給、惟須提出定貨單、以證明確係正當用途、同時聞英商銀行祇允供給本國定貨之外滙、使投機外滙家、無法冉經營此外滙交易、並聞美商花旗銀行等、亦取與英商銀行同樣行動、故嗣後之日方欲套取外滙、已無法施其技矣、關於日貨鉅量向中國傾銷、勢必受極大之打擊、</p>
<p>法定申請照舊辦理</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向中央銀行上海分行探悉、中央銀行對於正當商人之申請法定外滙、仍依照部定辦法、繼續辦理、並未停止接受及變更辦法、申請仍爲每星期一、核准仍爲每星期五、法定價格仍爲一先令二便士半、凡自本年一月一日以後裝運之進口貨、需用外滙之申請、非經政府特別准許、則不予供給法定外滙、凡進口貨之申請、必須附有貨物買際裝運之證明文件、關於私人申請外匯、每月爲一决、亦仍照舊辦理、香港之平準外滙基金管委會亦照常辦理、</p>
<p>上海市場將趨穩定</p>
<p>上海外匯黑市塲匯價七日起空前緊縮、八日英商匯豐銀行外匯掛牌第一决英匯七便士美匯十三元六二五、第二决英滙六便士七五、美滙十三元一二五、第三次英滙六便士半美滙十二元六二五、據新聲社記者向金融界及各業市塲探悉、關於外滙之緊縮、及外貨價格之飛漲、均係暫時之性質、預料行將轉趨穩定、此種混亂狀態、實為一般　者故意放謠所造成、金價之飛漲亦爲投機份子操縱所致、</p>
<p>黑滙暴縮委會研究</p>
<p>平準外滙基金管理委員會對於上海黑市塲外滙之暴縮、會於七日午後在港集議、除委員羅傑士等出席外、中央銀行業務局局長席德懋、亦抵港列席研究、對外傳平準基金一千萬鎊已用罄之說、已予吾認、並謂中國平準基金極爲豐富、足能維持目前之外滙能力、望勿自相驚擾及憂慮之、上海黑市塲外滙之緊縮、係暫時性質、又據銀行界某領袖之觀察、黑市外滙之緊縮、與國貨各業有益無害、能减少入超、促進輸出、</p>
<p>中行掛牌並無變動</p>
<p>中央銀行上海分行昨日公佈之外滙掛牌行市、英滙一先令二便士半、美滙三十美元、日滙一百零三元、法匯一千零八十法郎、德匯七十五馬克、港滙九十五港元、白銀平衡稅爲百分之四·五〇、海關金二元三角九分四、標金標準一千二百零六元二角、以上價格、與前相同並無變動、則足證中國政府對於維持法定外滙、始終如一、並無更動、市場上所傳之謠言、殊不足信、</p>
<p>西報所載滙行市</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、中英平準基金委員會今（八日）晨復拒不在上海出售任何外滙、致法幣復不得支持、其外滙率乃繼續降落、午刻左右、英匯縮至穴便士五、等於法幣的三十五元五角易英金一鎊、美元漲至十二元一二五、等於法幣八元有奇易美金一元、商人投機者與一般公衆今晨購買之外滙較小、因出售外滙者大减也、但市塲上欲購外匯者、較昨日（七日）大增、十盎斯金條今晨在暗市達新高度、其行市爲二千四百四十元、開盤爲二千二百四十五元、創此破紀錄之高價後、以二千三百三十五元收盤、又今晨開盤日元頗强、計一元〇四分、較法幣高四分、多週來尙屬第一决、惟午刻復跌至九角八分、今午、四川路兌換店以九角九分出售日元、較今晨之匯率跌落六分、</p>
<h3>先令暴縮　五金漲價　成本提高二三成　各貨擬一律上漲</h3>
<p>上海市五金業同業公會、頃因先令速日暴縮、該業各會員同業向歐美各廠商所定五金物品、結算成本、均提高在百分之二三十之間、茲悉該　公會為籌商妥善辦法起見、特經決定於本月十日（星期六）下午四時、在會所召開臨時會員大會、聞將討論劃一市價、各項花色一律上漲、以維血本、現已發出通告、望各會員準時出席與議、</p>
<h3>黑市外匯限制供給　入超可望激减　本年入超額創戰後最高紀錄　限制外匯最有利於國貨事業</h3>
<p>上海爲遠東唯一通商大埠、執全國海關之牛耳、進出口貨物為各關之冠、當戰事初起之際、因貿易重心內移、以致海關貿易、突告衰落、自去年夏季起、逐漸恢復、今年四月份進出口貿易、總値八千八百七十七萬零七百六十四萬元、創戰後之最高新紀錄、惟入超數字</p>
<p>有增無減</p>
<p>如去年全年入超僅五千一百八十五萬七千元、而今年一月爲九百三十五萬六千四百十三元、二月爲五百十二萬九千三百零四元、三月爲三千三百零九萬二千七百四十八元、四月爲二千四百七十三萬七千二百五十八元、一月至四月共爲七千二百三十一萬六千元、較</p>
<p>去年同期</p>
<p>二千二百八十萬零五千元、竟增加五千四百五十一萬一千元、國府爲减少外匯漏巵起見、曾一再設法消除滬關之入超、奈因滬關地處淪陷區域、權力不及、聞今匯豐銀行</p>
<p>限制供給</p>
<p>黑市塲外匯、亦爲消除滬關入超之一策、故此後之滬關入超數字、或能逐漸銳减、並能使國貨事業發展、與整個抗戰前途、受益匪淺、</p>
<h3>外滙變動　影響米價　各米一律漲四五角　洋米進口恐難銷售</h3>
<p>自外匯行市突然發生劇烈變動後、各項物價、齊告飛漲、滬米市塲價格、昨晨市均上漲、計最高白粳原已回至十七元關、詎叉復漲至十七元五角、其中决號客秈。杜粳。等、亦相繼報漲四五角、海外洋米、因外匯關係、與滬價相差頗遠、運來後當不易銷售、目下國內沿江各產地之來源、頗稱暢旺、市塲現貨充足、現雖驟遭外滙影響、突然回漲、係屬時聞性問題、不久當可降落、</p>
<h3>范根才　奉令擢升　所部編爲第一總隊　訓練組織益加周密</h3>
<p>忠義救國軍第八支隊第三大隊范根才所屬各部、因組織嚴密、訓練有方、故在浦南一帶、頗形活躍、時予日軍重創、無戰不捷、因而當地民衆、稱以游　鐵軍、復以內部特多得力之青年前進幹部、使地方民生各設施、如敎育之發達農工業等之發展、無不積極配合戰時需要、日前國府乘改編游擊隊伍之便、以范部確爲抗建過程中之有力部隊、擢升爲忠義救國軍淞滬指揮部第一縱隊第八支隊第一總隊、任命范根才爲總隊長、周明發爲總隊附、如是、范部實力益見雄厚、范氏自奉任命以來、對所屬各部訓練益加嚴密、組織益加强勁、對民衆方面、益加積極實行軍民合作、</p>

<h3>丁格勒慘死案　英已提書面抗議　丁氏腹部兩側戳傷甚深　日方謂丁撲擊觸及槍剌　綸昌又一英人受刺激身亡</h3>
<p>大陸報云、丁格勒被日水兵戳傷殞命事、英總領事斐利溥已於昨日向此間日當局提出口頭抗議、英常局並將於今日（八日）　日方提出書面抗議、此說昨夜由英領事署某員予以證實，</p>
<p>又一職員猝然殞命</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、浦東陸家嘴綸昌紡織廠英籍職員丁格勒被檢刺戳傷殞命後一日內、該廠英籍職員麥克阿立斯透亦於昨（七日）夜殞命、麥氏無戳傷或創傷之徵象、渠之殞生、目前仍爲疑團、今日（八日）午後、由安徒遜醫生施行解剖、然後英法庭騐屍官將決定應吾開庭鞠訊、麥氏於昨晚在綸昌紡織廠中被其他英籍職員發現坐桌旁、突倒地木然不動、乃舁之乘汽艇急速渡江來滬、午後十一時三十分甫過、送抵宏恩醫院、經醫生檢騐、謂已氣絕、據信麥氏抵院時已殞命半小時以上矣、今雖不能據現象而察覺麥氏何以致死、惟一般人以爲渠因丁格勒於衝突時受致命重傷而受刺激、兼以天氣濕熱、致心臟衰竭而亡、按麥氏年三十五、入綸昌已六載、</p>
<p>丁氏腹部戳傷甚深</p>
<p>字林報云、浦東陸家嘴綸昌紡織廠監工英人丁格勒、年四十一、星期六日晨在廠中與日水兵衝突、被槍刺所戳致受重傷、而於昨（七日）晨五時三十分在公濟醫院因傷重殞生、屍體置萬國殯儀館、昨日午後、施行解剖、發現丁氏腹部兩側受戳傷甚深、遍體傷痕纍纍、</p>
<p>舁滬醫治為時過晚</p>
<p>據英領事署某員咋日午後聲稱、三浦之抗議、刻正在研究中、據初步調查所悉、日兵稍受激怒、但似會施用不必要之殘暴行爲、丁氏被槍刺所戳、受傷甚重、直至午後七時、接治療丁氏之日海軍外科醫生來訊、猶稱丁氏傷勢、無須焦慮、而大有起色、至十時、接丁氏傷勢轉劇之訊、急往浦東舁送丁氏來滬、入公濟醫院、施行手術、然已晚矣、</p>
<p>整個事件正在研究</p>
<p>丁氏當在廠中衝突時、被戳傷、頭部無受傷之象、故日方所稱、以槍托擊其頭部云云、似不確實、但丁氏右臂有傷痕、似被擊倒於地、然後被槍刺所戳、星期二日午後、英副領事欲晤傷者、並請任傷者由外國醫生治療、均遭日方拒絕、丁氏或誤解日水兵入廠之意、但日方會施用不必要之暴行、整個事件、今方在英當局研究中、</p>
<p>日方諉稱丁氏撲槍</p>
<p>據目擊其事者言、丁氏曾開槍一響、但非向日軍官放射、而係向地下開放者、雖然曾威脅日軍官、但或因神緒不寗之故云、日方昨在招待記者席上、由日海軍發言人宜稱、丁氏出槍威脅日軍官、而其手槍被擊落後、復撲擊一水兵、時數水兵均持槍刺環彼而立、「或係丁氏撲擊時、觸及槍刺」、或詢丁氏觸及槍刺若干决、發言人答、渠受傷五六處、包括被槍托擊傷在內、</p>
<p>身受創傷能否步行</p>
<p>或詢英領事當局於午後四時請求移交丁氏、日方何以不允、日大使館發言人答、日方必須進行調查、迨丁氏受傷後步行至日軍司令部、丁氏曾堅拒日醫生爲之治療、有詢、身受此種創傷五六處、能吾步行、發言人答、以渠之地位、不能討論此問題、</p>
<p>靈判權之限制問題</p>
<p>有詢任何外人抗拒日軍、其領判權將被尊重乎、發言人答在原則上將尊重領判權、但若在侵佔區內採取危害日軍安全之行動、則其人之領判權有限制矣、此非應用法律之問題、而係維持日軍安全所必需之直接行動問題云、按丁氏於一九一九年首决來滬、是年八月入警務處服務、至一九三〇年卸職赴美、同年返滬、和綸昌公司、獨身居浦東、於運動界頗著聲明、</p>
<p>老廠被迫又告停工</p>
<p>綸昌紡織公司原有新老兩廠、分設浦東陸家嘴及白蓮涇、自新廠發生工潮後、老廠工人仍照常工作、未遭波及、旋因僞方之威嚇煽惑、致被迫加入罷工、但各工人等深明大義、不願供人利用、作無謂之犧牲、故於前晨即行復工、詎僞「工人同盟會」又復出而破壞、並由僞警數十名赴廠前開槍示威、迫令工人離廠、結果有男工一名被彈擊中、傷勢危殆、鐵蹄壓迫下之工人、將無噍類云、</p>
<h3>日方詭詞聳聽</h3>
<p>（路透社八日東京電）海軍省發言人金澤少將、今日招待新聞記者時聲稱、浦東綸昌事件、形成上海英人各界反日氣氛之表現、此事本身係一小事、依渠意見、英人應維持鎭靜態度、因此種小事之累積的影響、可導成時局中之重大發展也、丁格勒受致命傷、渠對之固覺悼惜、惟日本陸戰隊係在與英當道成立完全諒解後維持綸昌廠區域內之和平與秩序者、乃丁氏竟對陸戰隊之司令、與其他高級軍官、舉起實彈手槍、且曾對之發出一彈、此種不可理解的强橫態度、殊堪歎息、蓋日本水兵未有一人、不視此熊度爲對於日本海軍之污辱也云、</p>
<p>（路透社八日倫敦電）今日此間各報、皆以顯著地位登載關於編昌聯員丁格勒受傷不治之新聞、但向未發表評論、官塲認此爲特殊的不良案件、惟須俟上海領事報告後、方有行動、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、浦東日海軍陸戰隊長野地少佐召請浦東各外國工廠代表、於午後一時赴其司令部會議、所談何事、未經說明、惟衆料將澈底討論勞工局勢、</p>
<p>偽同盟會排英舉動</p>
<p>浦東綸昌廠罷工事件、偽方所組之「工人同盟會一爲使事態擴大起見、現正製造種種新動作、層出不窮、昨日午後、又舉行第三决有組織之反英大遊行、事先分派活動份子、挨戶誘致工人、謂去領一救濟費」、當昨日上午八時、男女工人陸續赴東昌路僞「區公署」門首集中、迫令工人重行登記、每人發給麵包票紙一角、作爲午膳金、又給所謂救濟金領取證一紙、恐工人走散、不願參加遊行、故救濟金延置不發、至午後二時、即令工人再行集中「區公署」門首、每人發排英紙旗一面、繼有所謂「中國工人同盟會」及一新上海勞動反英同盟會」等活動份子百餘人前導、向東出發、兜遊浦東大道楊家宅爛波渡楊家渡等處、的歷兩小時之久、再回至「區公署」門首齊集、乃憑證發款、每人僅領一元、各工人初知係發五元、乃結果大失所望、且因人數較多、秩序粉亂不堪、在塲彈壓之僞「警」僞「探」、復以鞭棍亂擊、視工人無異如牛馬、挨打工人、莫不呼怨不已、又悉六日上午、　家嘴新廠內發生「同盟會」中　　、以木棍毆打上工工友事、除英人一名被刺外、尙有工人三十餘名、被日軍野地部隊拘去、收押兩日夜、已就昨日釋放、惟附有條件、迫彼等互相連保、每二人保一人、在工潮未解決前、須担保任何一工人、不得再行進廠工作、</p>
<h3>美艦隊司令　昨離滬赴華北　此為最後一次視察華北　美江防艦今日出發巡弋</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾海軍大將、乘旗艦奧古斯泰號於今日（八日）午後一時、自滬啟程赴秦皇島青島與烟台、此爲雅大將最後一次赴華北視察、其私人快艦依沙佩爾號載雅夫人、亞洲艦隊參謀長麥克唐納爾上校之夫人、與其他海軍官佐之夫人、亦於今晨八時起椗駛華北、兩艦將在</p>
<p>海中相遇</p>
<p>同駛秦皇島、按照目前預定程序、奧古斯泰號將至秋季返滬、但新司令赫德海軍大將、於八月一日左右、任亞洲艦隊司令職時、奧古斯泰號或將更　其預定程序、又江防美艦沃湖號、定明日（九日）午後三時許，由滬起椗、循揚子江上駛至南京與蕪湖、美掃雷艦鷺驚號自馬尼刺駛來、明午</p>
<p>可抵上海</p>
<p>自馬尼刺經華南各港駛來之美驅逐艦黑鷹號、定下星期日抵此、美艦畢柯斯號定星期六日離滬駛華北、包括驅</p>
<h3>行駛啓海外輪　更改地名結關　其他口岸各輪多已停駛　海關當局應付環境困難</h3>
<p>江海關日籍稅務司通告、於六月一日起、有江海口岸九處、航行之船隻、須事前微得日海陸軍准許、發給許可證、並須額外稅務司之核准、方准結關、上星期六（三日）、英商太古公司之萬通輪、未備上項手續、結關時致遭拒絕、停班一决、於本星期一（即五日）、乃將海門啟東改爲青龍港·二和港、始得結關行駛等情、已誌前報、</p>
<p>情形特殊難於應付</p>
<p>但昨日報載內港航輪照常結關、日籍稅務司阻止航輪結關事、海關當局決遵照海關條例、維護行政等語、茲探悉海關當局、確有維護之意、惟在此特殊情形之下、亦難以應付、即以萬通輸上星期六結關受阻之事、已可見海關當局之困難矣、</p>
<p>更改地名避免糾紛</p>
<p>又報載日籍挽司通告、雖稱對於行駛海門·啟東·阜寗·泉州·興化·等九口岸、航輪須經日海軍當局發給許可證、結關時將該項許可證及報關單、經日籍稅務司簽字、始能結關開行、各外輪公司截至昨日、並未照辦、記者亦知各輪公司確未照辦、但所以未辦者、因未派船行駛禁止之口岸、故不須照辦耳、</p>
<p>牛莊改航事實證明</p>
<p>至太古公司之牛莊輪、原定六日由滬開往廈門、兼灣興化，泉州、後改駛北洋、已於昨午裝儎麵粉一萬餘包、棉紗疋頭二百餘件、及雜貨等赴青島·天津、雖更改航綫、各輪船公司常有之事、不足爲異、但牛莊輪派駛在禁止之興泉兩地、適在萬通輪結關被阻之後、故牛莊之更改航綫、與尋常不同、恐略有關係、又稱關於行駛北沙各航輪、雖已不用海門啟東名稱、然結關並未經日籍稅務司之簽字云云、可知其禁止之目的、即在名稱、旣各輪不用海門啟東字樣、當然不受阻撓、</p>
<p>出口艙單臨時改繕</p>
<p>記者昨午適在某英商輪船公司、該公司行駛北沙之船、亦適到滬、該輪買辦至公司向該行高級職員云、出口之艙單、勿繕海門啟東（英文）、免生糾葛、該高級職員卽取閱出口艙單、仍書海門啟東、當用鋼筆劃去、改繕三和港之英文字樣、記者曾在旁目覩、對於日籍稅務司之通告、海關及航商、是吾實行、外界恐難明瞭、有關係之航商、當必瞭然也、逐艦四艘之亞洲艦隊驅逐艦第十五分艦隊、自馬尼刺直駛華北、將不留泊上海、</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>全滬人士注意之下　外匯及商品市場之變動　安定人心為第一　趁火打刦宜審慎</h3>
<p>昨日市塲情形，更與前日不同，蓋前日金融市塲之劇變，猶爲一般人所不及知，不及知，雖危險甚大，不覺其爲危險。自經昨日報紙披露後，虛慌遂及於滬市全埠，有所談，談外匯，有所憂，憂物價，其實各人能如前日之不知不覺，亦是坦然自若，何况變化之來，決不置大衆利益於不顧，正不必徒作杞人之憂天。至於外匯基金如何如何，此中情况，本爲一般人所不及知，其所傳亦未必可信。减少容或爲事實，亦無庸多說。惟其减少，故覺外滙市塲有改弦易轍之必要，「失之東隅，收之桑榆」，尙不失「亡羊補牢」之一法也。</p>
<p>英匯至昨日又小去一辦士，為六辦士五，祇及法定　價百分之四十五而弱，美匯十二元六二五，祇及法定匯價百分之四十二有奇，其所反映者當然為供給之缺乏，而所買賣自爲市上所存之籌碼，故在新接繼未達到前，滙市決無轉機之望。默察市塲人心，有兩種趨勢，一種是靜觀，暫不欲有所表示，如大宗出口之生絲等是也。一種是急於漲價，希冀得意外之收穫，而彌或有之損失。至股富之存心亦分兩種，一部分尙在求作資金之逃避，一部分則在居奇以厚其貨殖。觀於黃金市價續漲一百六十四元，英美金鎊各漲三元，英鈔漲兩元五角，美鈔漲六角八分，以及衆業公所外股成交之鉅大，均是此種心理之表現。然如平心靜氣一想，法幣如果到其理想中之境界，尙復成何景象，則今日之惶急，適見其爲庸人自擾而巳。</p>
<p>惟上海市面，已紊亂達於約點，皆欲一明中國政府對於此次事變所應公開的態度如何，記者至屬稿時止，尚未獲有此項電訉，但不久當有所表示也。我人所望者除政府對於此後外滙方針亟應有所表示以安人心，而免多作無謂之損失外，並望上海人士，允其是工商界及一般投機分子，弗趁火打劫，弗使市塲更陷於紊亂而竟至於不可收拾之境。要知匯市終有穩定之一日，市價之為漲為跌，亦自有其應循之路錢，預事張惶，設不幸反弓而踣，禍由自招，原不足惜，其如整個市場之安危何！</p>
<h3>金融匯豐掛牌三次改縮　外匯情勢愈緊張　洋行爭購再創低價　港匯亦縮七元之巨</h3>
<p>外滙市况、前日匯豐掛牌價、竟在週三午後例假期中、破例作第三决之改縮、計英滙較同日上午十時五十分縮二五、美滙亦縮半元、而昨日掛牌復見三次　動、火點三十分時即見改縮、英匯計半辦士美匯爲一元、旋於十點、英匯又縮二五、美滙續縮五角、後於十時二十分、英滙再縮二五、美滙再縮五角、而其他各匯、亦一致慘落、計最後英匯懸六辦士半、美滙十二元六二五。故創有掛脾以來之空前新低價、暗市英美兩滙等、亦仍陷於極端混亂狀態中、各大進口洋行爭先力扒不已、加以又値香港因逢英皇誕辰紀念慶祝無市、故外商銀行賣意頗淡、大非貴價不肯脫手、致潛勢頗緊、計英金一度曾喊緊至六辦士二五、美滙亦會喊軟至十二元二五、後因滙豐麥加利等起而維持、致人心頓形安定、洋行扒風稍戢、遂見回硬、結果英金六辦士七五、及美匯十三元一二五爲收盤價、較上日英續緊七五美亦縮一元五角、至港匯較最後價亦猛軟七元、</p>
<p>惟吾人於此、有二點、應有所考慮　焉、　經此次匯市變動後、人心浮動、自所難免、益以投機之流、利用機會、推波助瀾、更有促進市塲騷動之可能、然此爲變動過程中、應有之狀態、過時即富仍歸平復、故吾人應以冷靜之頭腦、期待事實之發展萬不可因一時之風潮、作庸人之自擾、蓋即所謂一靜制百動者也、　自匯市限制供給後、囤藏居奇、已肇其端、凡直接間接與洋貨有關者、無一不在積極昂騰中、其影響於一般民生者綦巨、允其如日用所必需而以外滙計算其利益者、叉將作加重一般負擔之想、故希望政府、當有明顯之表示、闡明此决之作用而於進口必需品、並應從速規定條例、准其依照法定匯價、自由申請、如是則無論黑市塲縮至如何程度、何有於必需品之價格哉、若是則人心安、人心安、則市面定矣、</p>
<p>匯市場極度紊亂</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均縮零六二五、紐的銀價呆定、倫敦生金未更、滙兌英對美小六毫、對滬仍平、對法降四生丁、美對英勿動、對滬猛跌一元四角七分、對法縮零六二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、時聞匯豐銀行前日雖値午後週三例假、但因外滙奇緊、故破例在下午二時三决揭曉、英滙縮二五、美亦掛小半元、其他亦一致下落、昨日晨開現貨賣價、英滙計七辦士二五、美滙爲十四元一二五、較之前收、英緊二五、美亦軟半元、開後市勢頗形紊亂、各大洋行界爭先力扒、加之香港因慶祝英皇誕辰休業、因之本市銀行界不肯廉售、致市象猛緊、計洋行結進荷蘭華比現貨美匯僅十三元七五及六二五、迨九時三十分滙豐掛牌揭曉、英金又縮半辦士、美亦又軟一元、其他亦再下落、白銀平衡稅揭曉小半分、計徵百分之四。五〇、時錢兌業扒進華義現貨美滙祗十三元七五、繼而洋行叉結進某行現貨美滙爲十三元六二五、廷至十時、滙豐掛牌二次揭曉、又一致掛縮、故人心愈慌、加之洋行界亦力扒不休、再度吸進匯豐。麥加利現貨英金由七辦士做緊至六辦士半、十時二十分後滙豐掛牌三决揭曉、又再度在降、故人心更形不安、時英金最軟竟喊過六辦士二五、美匯最緊亦呌過十二元二五、故潛勢益緊、後聞滙豐賣意稍濃、其他外行亦聯袂稍來吐售、加之洋行結款轉稀、致潛　稍見回鬆、計大通賣予同行現貨美滙爲十三元七五、延至午收銀行賣價、英滙計六辦士九三七五、美匯爲十三元六二五、</p>
<p>後市供給稍暢旺</p>
<p>後市外行賣意尙濃、市勢續鬆、首由有利吸進同行現貨英金爲七辦士、時西商沙遜突來猛扒爲狀重復趨緊、計沙遜力進外行現貨美滙計十三元二五、並叉現貨英金爲六辦士八一二五、繼而洋行競相吸進、華比現貨美滙由十三元、步緊至十二元八七五、入後外行麥加利塞予洋行現貨英金六辦士七五、　某行亦吐予洋行現貨美滙爲十三元一二五、時港匯亦猛緊至四十五元左右、聞洋行亦稍有結進、延至晚收銀行現貨賣價、英滙計六辦士七五、美滙爲子三元一二五、結果　之隔昨午收、英猛縮七五、美亦劇軟一元五角、港滙照四十五元軋過、亦大縮七元、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>
<p>天津匯市亦猛縮</p>
<p>天津八日電、今晨滙市開盤、比上日英滙猛縮七五、美滙亦縮一元五角、申滙　小二元、「聯鈔、又上升一元五角、惟香港因値英王謊辰休假、昨日無市、</p>
<p>基金將竭御無稽</p>
<p>路透社七日倫敦電、金融新聞今日載文論中國之法幣、　穩定中國法幣在八便士或八便士半之價格企圖、業已作罷、穩定基金處昨日決議任滙價作自然之趨勢、非至已有良好理由、相信其價格已臻可易維護之水準時、不欲再作穩定其滙價之企圖、至所以作此決議者、蓋鑒於邇來中國商業入超高增、及巨數資金向外流出之故、此使五百萬鎊穩定基金甚受侵擾、外間有謂此項基金行將告竭者、此　毫無根據云、</p>
<h3>外幣掀騰　金鎊再漲三元　英美鈔票同升</h3>
<p>昨日英純金與英美滙兌俱未更動、本埠外滙變動益烈、洋行客戶等結款旺盛、外銀行供給甚弱、滙豐銀行掛牌迭决改縮、市况紊亂、結果英匯爲六辦士七五、美滙爲十三元一二五、烚赤開盤甚堅、外滙未有確定方針、人心驚慌、金號錢兌業客戶等連袂而進、售者稀少、供給困難、市價迭現新紀錄、最高峯達二千四百四十元、波濤之烈、駭人聽聞、午後稍回、下午變動仍烈、升降倐忽、動輒數十元、高峯復達二千四百元、收盤爲二千三百八十元、暗盤進者仍湧、結果　上日再漲一百六十四元、外幣因外匯迭縮、烚赤在漲影響、俱追隨在升、英美金鎊需要甚殷、供給未暢、英美金票交易旺盛、市况堅强無比、香港票等需要俱暢、市價紊亂、隨意高抬、僅義大利德金票乏人注意、猶太人被逐來滬者頗多供給、徜徉四川路各錢莊前、將餘剩外幣、兌換法幣、頗形熱鬧、日金票亦隨勢激漲、下午爲九角九分三　、朝鮮票頗穩定、仍爲八角四分、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英美金鎊各升三元、英金票升二元五角、美金票升六角八分、香港升一角六分、法郎要升一分二釐、新加坡票荷蘭票各升三角、安南票升八分、羅比票升一角四分、坎拿大票升五角五分、斐律濱票升三角、澳金票升一元五角、暹邏票升三角、僅義大利票德金票未更、</p>

<h3>同姓</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>在中國的宗法社會裏，同姓的力量是很大的。捧出一個著名的祖宗來，自稱是他的「遙遙華胄，」固然可以嚇倒人，就是在械鬥時，大喊一聲「姓×的一齊上呀！」也可以先聲奪人，博取勝利。</p>
<p>幾乎殺盡四川人的張獻忠，要和文昌帝君聯宗，遇見了張桓侯的廟，也不敢燬；殺人八百萬的黃巢，不殺姓黃的人，甚至黃岡黃梅等縣，為了頭上頂着一個黃字，也得免於屠戮：同姓之力，化及盜賊，難怪數千年來，同姓的力量不衰，而現在更有變本加厲之勢了。</p>
<p>所謂變本加厲，不是我瞎說的。有些人，除了要獲得同姓的力量，而一時又無法可想，就不得不追踪桃園，媲美三雅園，拜把通譜，以厚勢力之外，就一眼看上了許多外國大亨。據說，有名「高爾礎」的，「爾」字排行，「基礎」平等，除了和那位俄國大文豪聯宗以外，還可以作為他的同胞手足。於是，又有姓蕭的人，按古人「伯達伯適」之例，自名「叔歸」，以與英國的「蕭君伯納」稱兄道弟。……</p>
<p>我想，將來這也不見得不會見之於事實吧：姓「馬」的名「克是」或「服斯」；姓「姓」的名「仲常」；姓「羅」的名「斯祿」；姓「史」的名「丹峯」或「青林」……。可惜中國除了古時有一個被人疑為印度黑炭的「墨翟」以外，現在似乎沒有姓「墨」的，除了古時有一個高臥華山的「希夷先生」以外，沒有姓「希」的，否則現代怪傑的「尊姓」，豈不是又可以藉着這些姓「墨」姓「姓」的妙人，拉到我們的「百家姓」上來，蔚為盛族？</p>
<p>有人說，中國人如果真正這樣，也沒有什麽不對，因為外國人也未嘗不如此。外國儘有許多富豪，費了大量的錢，請人製造譜牒，來證明他們是什麽名人的後代；也儘有許多軍閥或聞人，在他們的姓名中加上Von，de，Don這類的字眼，來表示他們是什麽貴爵的子孫。他們還盛行「內婚制」，比了中國的「同姓不婚」還不如。可是這話雖然有理，却誤解了我的意思，因為我對於這樣善於聯宗通譜的人，除了竭誠稱讚以外，並不是看不起他們。這話還是證實了同姓力量的偉大，連外國也就古已有之。</p>
<p>不過外國的事情究竟飄渺得很，還是回轉頭來仍舊說說我們自己吧。</p>
<p>有些機關裏，為某姓所把持，上至領袖，下至僕廝，大都是某姓，於是有人稱這機關為「某姓家祠」，認為這是不應該的。然而我却認為這事無妨；古時不是有「岳家軍」，「楊家將」，「薛家將」之類麽？而且古來的天下就是由一姓所把持的。所謂某姓者，以今之人而行古之道，豈非古之人歟！古之人歟！死了的人都是好的，古之人尤其好，不是「先王」，至少是個「先民」，我們實在不應該肆無忌憚，妄加譏評。</p>
<p>因此，對於這種竭力培植同姓勢力者，我除了贊同以外，還想貢獻一些意見，給他們參考參考，不知他們以為何如：</p>
<p>假使是姓「孔」的，可以拉「孔明」和「孔雀」等為族人，因為姓「諸」的和姓「葛」的既然都可以仰攀臥龍先生，咱姓「孔」的自然成例可援，不落人後。至於「孔雀」，漢朝的楊修早就稱牠為「孔」夫子的家禽了。同樣，姓「楊」的就可以如孔羣所說，以「楊梅」為家果；姓「韓」的不妨請「韓盧」入族；姓「宋」的不妨招「宋鵲」上譜；……這樣一來，貴姓的勢力便益發雄厚，人人側目而視，不敢輕侮了。</p>
<p>有一位姓「梁」的文人，不肯以「伯鸞」和「太素」為先祖，却願以「綠珠」「紅玉」為先姑；又有一位姓「蔣」的幕友，不肯隨便聯宗，而自認是「蔣竹山」的後裔：這些人實在其愚不可及也，理應一世沒出息，凡有志於功名富貴者，慎毋學之！</p>
<h3>坑（上）</h3>
<p>— 電長</p>
<p>兀自搖呀擺地踱下了橋，我眼珠直望在前面，只不理睬右邊那個傢伙。</p>
<p>我兩隻腿彳彳亍亍，蠻自在，却又甩眼角睨着他：像燒剩了半段的黃蠟燭，直楞楞地揷在那裏。我禁不住好笑起來……</p>
<p>忽然，聽見皮鞋和槍柄響，我趕緊側過身子：那傢伙正好把槍眼對準我底肚皮眼。我慢吞吞地舉起了手，褪去了臉上的笑容。然而，他却又放下了給揹在肩上，只從腰邊掏出根短桿子，踏着正步過來。</p>
<p>從我袋裏抄出三張法幣和八張秦檜票。他慌忙把三張的揷入袴袋裏，却把秦檜票都撕碎了。他陰險地笑了一下，用手指指那邊橋脚下，我才瞧見那邊正掘着一個坑兒；他像一個啞吧，右手掌舉過頭頂，左手掌齊腿兒的做了一直手勢。我於是吞了口唾沫走過去：那坑祇有三四尺深，一人多寬，坑旁泥堆前揷上一把小鏟子。</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>他照前做了做手勢，又陰險地笑了一下。要我掘嗎？下而有軍火？還是有他老子的墳在下面？他接着向着我揮揮手槍，我　才對他倔强地挺挺頭頸，也這末笑呀笑的陰險一下，過去提着這把小的鬼鏟子，試試，輕輕的——要是長些，正好劈過去，送他媽的半段黃蠟燭歸西天；於是我把它舞弄着，他這會可怒了：緊縮着眉毛咬咬牙，把兩隻腿縮後一些，蹬了蹬，這表情活像燒着尾巴的老馬猴在乾呌。</p>
<p>我裝着滿不在乎的望望前面，却空曠曠地連個鬼都沒有。媽的，我祇好「敬遵台命」的掘了，掘呀掘的，我偷眼望望那個傢伙，他拍弄着手槍，我就呃的大聲地乾嗆一下，他驀然一跳，兩隻腿却又縮後一些，把槍眼對準了我，這樣我又掘，掘……燥得很，就在掌中吐了些沫，搓搓，掘着，剷着。等一會，又睨了他一下：他又除惡地笑呀笑的笑了，繼而悠閑地從袋裏挖出一枝香烟，燃了噴吸起來。</p>
<p>掘着，挖着，挑着泥，比剛才深了兩尺，我才歇手，又大大地乾嗆了一聲。他踱了過來，拍拍我底肩，又做做手勢；還要這末深？你老子今天才　氣！</p>
<p>我懶洋洋地舞着鏟想：下面的軍火可有多少，誰留在這兒？真納悶！掘，掘，掘，呔，呔，我就在掘他底祖墳呢，掘呀掘的，掘，掘，掘，坑旁泥也堆得高高的……怪！我肩上突然給刺得痛痛地，側過頭望去：他正把手槍柄敲了我一下；我嚷：「什麽？你老子……」槍眼便對着我底咽喉，烏油油地，我才悶着聲又俛下去，掘，掘，真他媽媽的！我恨恨地吐了口涎沫，搓搓手：下面真個掘出槍來，我就用了開掉他這個，乾脆！一對一，怕還幹不了？真正羞煞人；好，掘，掘，掘。</p>
<p>我又望了過去，他正匍着拾起碎票子來，半段黃蠟燭似的身體却更短了。突然，我底心腔子幾乎跳了出來，忍不住要舉起鏟，一個劍步跳出坑來，沒頭沒臉的給他……我正準備幹他媽的，他却站起來了，整整揹着的長槍，　呀　　地。</p>
<p>我打了個寒噤，於是又裝着掘，掘，偷眼瞧見他把碎鈔票授了過來，又扮上一個惡鬼臉，我給他一個不理睬。他却蹬蹬脚嘰咕着踱了過去。我忍不住暗罵着，順手把鏟揚一揚：唿啦，泥污灑了過去，那傢伙的綁腿上也濺了好些，他猛可地回過頭，忙又退下幾步，蹬蹬脚，把手槍緊緊地揑着，扳了……却又於了下來，祇恨恨地咕嚕着，我不禁忍着笑，俛下掘，掘；又想把鏟揚過去，再濺他一頭一臉，但這會却不曾做。</p>
<p>他在上面嗚嗚地像唱歌起來了，多難聽，悽悽慘慘的。</p>
<p>這時，我底肩祗露出地面一些些，望望前面樹叢中正掛着一個血紅的太陽，空曠曠地，冷淸淸地……我才着了忙，揮了揮額上的汗，又掘，掘，掘。</p>
<p>現在，我底身子完全給埋在坑裏了，整整一個頭還在地面上，掘，掘，手兒已有些酸痛，真他媽媽的！</p>

<h3>如何精神自新——改變的生活（七）</h3>
<p>— 湯</p>
<p>常常聽見人說：「不要來勉强我做這，做那，等到我自己感到需要的時候，我自然會做的。」</p>
<p>最圓滿，最完備的人生是一個人格統一的，一舉一動自然而然的從內心發洩出來的人生。精神動員並不是一件人人可穿的外套，並不是裝飾品，而是一個內心革新的大運動。它向每人要求着最高的代價。肯付不肯付這代價由你作主。</p>
<p>有一位大學生覺得做人乏味，非常不愉快，內心充滿着恨毒的情緒——恨他在中學裏的校長和敎務長。他在中學求學時，因為品行惡劣，被那學校當局開除的。一天他遇見一位擁有基督精神的朋友，經過談話，就把自己無條件的投誠了基督，並且還做了一件他千萬不肯做的事。他去向校長和敎務長道歉。從此他的生活和從前大改變了。積極，前進，和愉快的精神替代了頹廢，停頓，和憂鬱的生涯。像他這樣的人纔能算是精神動員了。他已經脫離私生活的束縛，能專心在同學中推進精神或道德革命了。　上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>海底的田舍</h3>
<p>— 驥</p>
<p>數年前，荷蘭政府因為國內地寡民眾，曾和大海搏鬥，費去巨額金錢，在距陸若干哩外，築成一道巨壩，然後將水抽乾，再用土填平，現已成為一片　土良田。這全由於荷蘭的水利工程，獨步世界，才能成功，而其魄力的偉大，也足以令人欽佩了。荷蘭費了偌大人力物力，才得到彈丸之地，這可以反映歐洲土地的寶貴。那末，擁有廣博土地，不知利用，任它荒廢，無益民眾，豈不是暴殄天物？本期Magazing　Digest轉載倫敦「聽者」報一文，記這新地的情形，很有興趣，現在把它譯錄如下：</p>
<p>荷蘭有一處地方，八年前還是海底，現在已成了繁榮的農村。數日前和我住在那裏的一位荷蘭農婦茗談。境內的農舍，都由政府建造，每舍有穀倉牛欄，佈置得很清潔。農婦請我看看他們黑白相間的母牛，共約三十頭，分排拴在一間燈光明亮的欄內，每頭旁邊，放着一個銅罐，牠們會用鼻子把罐蓋掀開，然後觸動機關，於是清水便滔滔流出。這不是信口胡　，我曾親見牠們這種動作。農舍四周，土地平坦，阡陌縱橫，一望無際，我所到過的農村，從未見過如此整齊的田野。更有白色和鮮紅色的農舍，如疏星一般，點綴其間，相映成趣，磚砌的幽靜的路上，常有汽車風馳電掣而過。凡此情形，令人斷想不到幾年之前，這裏還是海底哩。</p>
<p>在這海底的田莊，現在已有自來水和電燈，明年電話也可造成。這一切的舒適安全，全靠造在荷蘭西海濱間長二十六哩的一道巨壩，它擋在北海之水，而把Zuyder　Zee化成一個清水湖，這湖的部分，至少還未開墾。</p>
<p>荷蘭政府在完成大工之前，曾在海中造成一島，然後把堤壩逐漸展廣，直到成了一個狹口而止。北海的急流從這狹口湧入，其勢很猛。封閉這狹口，功極艱鉅，每次把砂石傾下，都被海水衝去。但一次復一次，到底把這狹口封閉成功，現在北海之水已封它屈服。農夫安詳地在田中耕種，農婦靜坐在家中，聽那無綫電播音，安享快樂田舍的幸福。她們告訴我，第一灣中之水，費了六個月的光陰，才能抽乾，然後以兩年之久，將士中所含的鹽，搜括凈盡。起初因為泥土鬆濕，不能用馬耕種，就用機器代馬，自此以後，小麥大麥雀麥等田，逐步出現。因為這地是由海成陸，所以發生許多奇異問題，其中之一，便是魚問題，例如Zuyder　Zee的魚，原是　水魚，現在却變成鮮水魚了。</p>
<h3>故鄕的雨</h3>
<p>— 未明</p>
<p>經過了長長的狼狽的奔走以後，又終於喘息着在這兒停下來。</p>
<p>×，你要笑我吧，是的，我自己也不懂得自己為什末？我是變了，常常會無端獨自悵惘半天，不說也不動，呆望着白雲或是星星出神。處在這樣的「籠子」裏，周圍陰森森地，從窗子望到外面，一切全像給塗了一層暗灰色，於是人也如塗了重暗灰色，時感陣陣寒冷之來襲。</p>
<p>你是知道我深愛着故鄉的雨的，近來我更懷念着了。人在寂寞的當兒，前塵影事自然會兜上心來，即使　雜得可笑的細微的事情，都能使我　戀，而現在正是故鄉的雨的季節喲！</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>陽光畏怯地收去抹在楊柳梢頭的黃金，旋風若胡哨一陣緊一陣的時候，就如潤澤心靈的雨——我稱牠為潤澤心靈的雨不是無因的，而我正需要着牠喲——向我遞了個拜帖，於是捧了本心愛的書躺在屋後竹園中的榻上，靜靜地傾聽如心弦彈奏出來的微妙的雨聲，玩味着哀怨而美麗的詩句，注意力是被牠們各分了一半去。</p>
<p>嗒——嗒，滴在鮮艷得快要溶下來的尖尖的葉片上，似乎在講一個古代的甜美的故事。然後再墜下去，每次都迸出渾圓的清脆的音響。睜開眼，便有一道閃亮的白光跳過來，那是環繞竹園的小溪，晶瑩一如漂亮的銀帶，雨點碰到牠底面龐，立刻躍動着微笑似的波紋，讓微雨撫摩我底頭髪，我是真的悟出「智者樂水」的意義了。</p>
<p>我也喜歡雨霽後爽朗舒適的氣息，洗凈過的葉片底耀眼的青翠，顯得更嬌嫩並且發怒地茁長着的小草。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>我沒有勇氣回憶，寫給你，是用了痛苦的調子伸訴着的，還揚起淡淡的哀愁如輕雲呢。</p>
<p>×，你該懂得我。</p>

<p>本月四日，余談『蒙「滿」事件』一文，此文在善讀者觀之，明明可以看出日方之輕事重報，過事宣傳，卽不善讀者觀之，亦不過是刺激蘇俄之無能，而使其改變强硬態度，此文意義，盡於此矣。</p>
<p>不料有陳郭兩君，來書詰責，陳君並加我以破壞中蘇邦交之罪，未免言之過重，有失分寸，假定因余之一言而卽足以破壞中蘇邦交也者，亦必能因余之一言而足以改善中蘇邦交；夫中蘇邦交之破壞與改善，卽我國外交部長與駐蘇大使同時尚不可能，豈有因余之一言而卽足以破壞邦交耶？余言之權威如此，亦洵足自豪矣。</p>
<p>至於郭君所言，不免過於幼稚，其結語謂「余之歪曲論調，企圖混淆視聽」云云，不過余之歪曲論調，僅足以混淆足下之視聽，而並不能混淆他人之視聽也；而足下之視聽亦足下自混淆之，又非余之所得混淆也，茍足下不自混淆者則無人能混淆之矣。</p>
<h3>婦女界義賣運動</h3>
<p>— 南燕</p>
<p>「職婦」下月一日起舉行義賣　前晚播音徵集婦女界義賣品</p>
<p>讓我們擴大義賣運動吧，一切商店，文化機關，飲食店，都參加這個非常的總動員吧。</p>
<p>美術界義賣運動，已經舉行過了，並且收穫到極好的成績；戲劇界將舉行集體大規模的義賣演出，這更使我們異常興奮的。</p>
<p>而一般商店，戲院，飲食店的「按兵不動」，在義賣運動的呼聲當中，這似乎有點使人憤慨的，難道這些工作人員，連一點點正義感都沒有麽？</p>
<p>比如說上海婦女界，對於這義賣運動，就冷靜得可以，除掉一家刺繡學校舉行過一次小組的義賣之外，全上海婦女界，除了參與戲劇界義賣公演之外，一切婦女團體，各女子大學中學，及一切商店女職員等，為什麽不起來執行一次大規模的義賣運動呢？</p>
<p>在穿着「不同皮鞋」，燙着各式鬈髪，挽着男胳膊的太太小姐，你們似乎已經忘了你們的責任了，現在在「義賣」這一總的口號之下，為了全國的難胞，為了救救寄生於收容所中你們的姊妹，你們也就忍心不過問麽？</p>
<p>婦女們，請站出來，為「義賣」做點工作吧！</p>
<p>我所知道的，七月一·二·三·三天當中，上海有一個婦女團體，將舉行一次大規模的義賣展覽會，義賣的陳列品，以刺繡居多。地點是在寗波同鄉會。</p>
<p>這婦女團體，就是職業婦女俱樂部。</p>
<p>前天晚上，她們假大陸廣播電台舉行義賣播音，用意是推銷她們的義賣券，券價共分五角，一元，五元，十元數種·參加這播音節目的，除了「職婦」的歌唱以外，還有「益友社」及「華聯同樂會」的國樂及歌唱等。</p>
<p>節目是相當精彩的，如「職婦」的趙瑞娥小姐一個人唱了中英文四支歌，錢琪小姐也唱了兩去英文歌，黎陽小姐也唱了四支最新的歌曲；此外還有毛修頴小姐的提琴獨奏，「上海之歌」四部合奏等；「華聯」更有異常別緻的「暹邏詩」等，都是少見的精彩節目。</p>
<p>播音室裏是那麽熱，小姐們個個抹着臉上的汗珠，對着麥克風唱出最可愛的歌曲；電話中，更有不少聽眾，捐助刺綉用品參加義賣，也有很多人認購義賣券。</p>
<p>在外面一間，許多唱歌的小姐們，自己對着歌譜練習着，桌上的無綫電機，放送出播音室中演唱的節目。</p>
<p>職婦的主持人茅小姐到十點半鐘還沒有功夫吃飯，主持播音的吳湄小姐，出出進進的，更忙得可以，一忽兒在播音室對麥克風報告播音節目，希望聽眾多多捐助，一忽兒又出來關照誰輪到演唱。</p>
<p>由下午五點鐘起，直到晚上十一點鐘止，許多人都沒有休息過。吳湄小姐手裏，寫滿着參加義賣刺綉用品的單子，一晚上，她們是够辛苦了。</p>
<p>但是，我對於「職婦」這次「義賣」却不得不貢獻幾點意見：</p>
<p>能不能多約幾個婦女團體，同時合作舉行，這樣可以使陳列的用品格外廣泛，在義賣日子當中，所起的作用也可更大。</p>
<p>假如別個婦女團體不能參加這次義賣的，可請她們代為徵求婦女界「義賣品，」使這次義賣展覽會廣泛地建立起來。</p>
<p>但，「職婦」的這次發起「義賣」究竟各方面都是應該給予多少助力的。</p>
<p>我們希望別個婦女團體，也能够在短期內集合起來，舉行一次大規模的義賣運動！</p>

<p>— 渭</p>
<p>昨報載前大總統徐菊人氏在津寓逝世，享年八十一歲。徐氏文學優長，在位時以文治號召天下，柯著新元史之列為正史，即在徐氏任內所公布者。猶憶當民國十年九月間，徐氏曾鑄造紀念幣一種，一面係徐氏肖像，一面繪宮室樹木，題有「仁壽同登」四字。制作極為精美，而外間流行極鮮。頃讀蘇州蔣仲川先生所著中國金銀鎳幣圖說，載有此幣圖形，亟為轉錄於此，俾讀者對於徐氏當時文治之業，猶可於此幣之形制中得其彷彿焉。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十一回　認鄉親杵臼舊生涯　附權勢簪纓新貴族</p>
<p>可是趙樂天接到了這封信，不禁大怒起來。他想：有其父必有其女，真是不差的。我是出於滿懷好意，敎他的女兒，去勸勸她的父親，使之納於正軌，不要走入歧途。不想却碰了一鼻子的灰，可算得是「狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人心。」要是出於她父親的手筆，倒也罷了，那本是陷溺已深，再也無從援手，我本來也覺得多此一舉。現在這封信，却是佩英的親筆，她的筆跡，我已看得很熟透了。她的字裏行間，對於我是何等冷淡，好像我的寫信給她，徒使她增了厭惡之心。而且說以後不願再接受我的信，即使再接到我的信，也不答復的了，這是什麽話！從前我們一向是兄妹　呼，當然為了表示親熱起見，也因為我們兩家是關點遠親之故。此刻我寫信給她，還是稱她為佩英妹妹，而她的回信，竟稱呼為樂天先生了。這些關於稱呼上的小節，倒也不去管它，最豈有此理的，回信上說什麽「各人喜趣不同，以後各行其是」，那末她也跟了她的父親　志　節了嗎？可歎！可恨！趙樂天這時心中說不出的忿　，想世界上的女人，簡直是靠不住。像潘佩英那樣，我們總算是氣誼相投，以前在學生後　會的時候，她也是慷慨激昂，一個很熱心的女孩子。誰知那是像煞有介事的，不過遮人眼目罷了。不過為什麽一變就變得　般快，一個女子心腸，真敎人測不出。趙樂天心中又是恨，又是氣，但他還不肯死心。夜天睡不着，又寫了長長的一封信給潘佩英。信中又是　備，又是勸導。盼望她　有一封回信。但此信去後，如石沉大海。趙樂天那時茶飯無心，坐臥不定，方寸間　亂無主，自己覺得真是熱戀着潘佩英。因為潘佩英的拒絕他，而十分苦悶。最後　寫了一封信給潘佩英，表示決絕之意，大意是一寗可失戀，決不失志，不久你就可以聽到趙樂天為國捐軀的消息，我的魂靈總比較你乾凈　吧？</p>
<p>這封信，被趙樂天一位密友見了，他說：「樂天，你真太痴了，這種女子，　　她　甚？」其實，趙樂天以後所寫的信，潘佩英一封也沒有收到，都被她的父親沒收了。（一三一）</p>
<h3>「壽頭丘八」觀感</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Block-Heads”</p>
<p>米高美出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>「壽頭丘八」是勞萊哈台最後一部合作的電影了，之後，他們將勞燕分飛。哈台已與米高美繼續簽訂合同，公司當局並且已在覓尋代替勞萊的脚色；而勞萊呢，也因之控訴公司因解僱而所受的損失。勞萊哈台所主演的電影，給我們的印象如何，這裏暫且不談，但是這兩位始終以儍頭儍腦的動作，來博取觀眾的譁笑的丑角，這次的分手，或許也將感到一點悲哀吧</p>
<p>從他們所主演的長篇作品中，確有幾部可取的，但終究敵不過一味胡鬧的損失；但從看過了「護花大使」之後，覺得他們放棄了「主角」的地位，而祇是做一部作品中的重要「穿揷」，這在劇作者也容易給予他們一點噱頭，而整個戲也可以因他們的幫助，收綠葉之效。如果從這方面發展下去，（李滋三兄弟也有一部滑稽「三劍客」了）勞萊哈台似乎更有合作的必要，但是他們終究分手了。據傳來的消息，兩人中都有點自傲，彷彿他們的「成名」，並不是由於對方合作的關係：自傲之後，當然輕視對手；輕視之後，自然想獨擋一面來試試看了。</p>
<p>其實，我前面已說過，他們的作品還是以胡鬧為主體的，所以我贊成他們走「護花大使」這一條路；而現在，他們竟是想獨擋一面來試試看了。</p>
<p>那末，我們也等着試試看吧。</p>
<p>「壽頭丘八」近乎是「怕老婆」的續集。不過在劇本的編製上，還相當緊湊的。他們一貫的儍頭儍腦，雖也一如其舊，但如大戰告終後，勞萊在戰壕中獨守二十年；哈台去接勞萊的時候，以為他受了傷，已截去一腿；在十三層樓上的種種岔子，……這些噱頭也相當新鮮。</p>
<p>不過，「壽頭丘八」祇是短片，而在臥室中的一段劇已經覺得討厭了，他們想獨擋一面來主演長片，我們覺得更應該等着試試看了。</p>
<h3>「鴛夢初圓」</h3>
<p>“East　Side　of　Heaven”</p>
<p>新環球出口　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>「低音歌王」平克勞斯貝，在好萊塢的地位怎樣，我不知道；在中國（或者說上海）他已失去了觀眾了。為什麽呢？一言以蔽之，是歌唱明星的人才輩出！</p>
<p>我們知道嗓音一半是苦練而來的，一半還是有賴乎天賦。平克勞斯貝或許並不是不求上進，而確是無法發展他的歌喉了。不過，他終究是「低音歌王」，如果能有一個適合的劇本，也不難掩飾他的短處，而顯示他的長處的。</p>
<p>可是你看「鴛夢初圓」吧：平克勞斯貝雖然從開塲做到底，也從開塲唱到底，但在這樣一個「好萊塢型的喜劇」之中，他簡直是全部失敗了。</p>
<p>導演也是並不高明，所以瓊白朗黛兒也僅做了一個出塲的活動背景而已。</p>

<h3>關於白宅堂戲之確訊</h3>
<p>— 龍鳳精舍舊主</p>
<p>訪問張嘯林先生之一席談</p>
<p>自從本報刋佈了梅花館主的「驚人的劇訊」以後，凡是愛好戲劇的人，都非常的興奮，區區為了此事，亦曾經費了不少脚頭，向關係方面探聽消息，經梅花館主的指示，始知提調這個堂會的主幹人物，就是上次在大滬花園舉行盛大堂會的主人翁張嘯林先生。</p>
<p>我得到了這個消息，興趣陡然增厚起來，於昨天（七日）下午四時，特地到華格臬路張公館去拜望籌備這個大堂會的張總提調。到了那裏，張先生正在廊沿上坐着，和幾位朋友談天，經我向前說明來意，張先生很露出和藹慈祥的笑容，以下是區區和張先生所作的谈話：</p>
<p>（問）申報發表白太太五十大壽將舉辦盛大堂會的劇訊，是否有這回事？</p>
<p>（答）真有這回事，不過昨天起了變化了。</p>
<p>（問）怎麽會變化的？</p>
<p>（答）白太太的親長，看到申報所登的新聞，很表示不滿，他們的意思，認為在這種情勢之下，萬萬不應該有這樣盛大局面的堂會的舉辦，同時白太太的老世交吳子玉将軍，亦有電報到來，婉言勸阻，他電文中還提到希望將這個堂會，等到将來國家安定以後，再來補行舉辦。不過這事籌備已將就緒，要取銷亦感到非常困難，究竟此事能否終止，此刻尚未正式解決，大概須到明後天方有決定的辦法咧。</p>
<p>（問）此事籌備已有多少日子？</p>
<p>（答）籌備已有不少日子了。在上海雖然申報「游藝界」首先發表，大家在這兩天方始知道，但是北平方面，差不多已經轟動得九城皆知，不是這樣，吳子玉將軍怎麽會曉得呢？</p>
<p>（問）如果堂戲一定舉辦的話，報上所列的名角，是否都能南來參加？</p>
<p>（答）怎麽不能？可以說，到了日子，個個都是趕到。</p>
<p>（問）余叔岩亦能來嗎？</p>
<p>（答）余叔岩怎麽不能來？不要說在北平，就是他在外國，亦能請他來的。今天（指七日）申報上有一位先生說他如果來了，對不起以前辦堂會的幾位聞人，這是笑話！以前叔岩之不能來，因為身體有病，嗓子不出，現在身體好了，嗓子亦恢復了，請他唱戲，焉有不來之理？况且叔岩日前已有電报到此，不但他自己本人准來，並且還要帶他的高足李少春同來祝壽呢。</p>
<p>說到這裏，時間已經不早了，遂約期後會而別。</p>
<p>（最後消息）昨日外間盛傳名伶荀慧生孟小冬業已抵滬及梅蘭芳三日内自港啟程之說，經本報記者證明不確，蓋白宅堂會之是否依照原定計劃舉行，須於今明日作最後之決定；即使照辦，各處應邀名伶，預算亦須於三四日後到滬，總之此事將如何發展，本刋當盡忠實之報道，請讀者拭目俟之。</p>
<h3>記劉寶全一夕譚（下）</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>—梅邊雜憶之二</p>
<p>鼓書源流彌足珍貴</p>
<p>寶全於音調之外，對板眼尤所注重。嘗請大鼓書講究七言八句，切須简單清楚，不宜多帶助辭，亦不宜不帶助辭，須於有板時若無板，而無板之中却有板云。此寥寥數語，可謂深得個中三眛者矣。寶全技藝日精，聲譽日隆，然猶不自滿，虛懷謙冲，實亦致名之由。當其　歌宜南時，有李三爺者，營蒙古貿業，家貲豐厚，而最嗜鼓書，宴席間偶歌一曲，聲驚四座寶全得其指導之力尤多。寶全每登塲，李必在座。聽時閉目凝神，默默不作一語。手托水烟袋，狀如入睡。寶全見其在座，益自奮勉，不敢稍懈！李微頷其首，劉則心喜！蓋其頷首，即所以報好也。搖首則等於倒采，唱畢，必親往請益，得其頷首報可而止。兢兢自勵，有如此者！與寶全齊名者，尚有張從德，小呌天深癖之，幾無日不在座也。寶全五十幾時，初至上海，自謂由滬北返後，益求精進，始稍覺藝漸有成。民十九，應聘漢皋頗博佳譽。惟遺一恨事於該地，蓋為渠操絃者，竟溺死漢上也。先一夕登塲時，其人面如死灰，望者駭畏！翌日，渠獨自出遊浴於淺池，而竟以溺死聞。操絃者在寶全唱書時。要如臀膊。蓋須熟習唱法，襯托得宜也。數十年來，唯一白鳳言最可人意。次則余伯清，頃所隨者，亦已十餘年。初來之時，茫然俱不知，寶全親加指授，始克有成。寶全足跡遍豫魯諸省，所至蜚聲。軍旅武人，尤喜昵之。嘗遊曲阜，衍聖公款若上賓下榻府第，流連數月之久。寶全所能之曲百數十闋，習唱者纔二十餘節耳。不喜灌留聲音片，憎其束縛，不能肆揮如意也。當台上歌唱時，並非千篇一律，臨時亦偶有變化云。生平不受門人，雖有稱劉某學生者，大都虛借其名，並非香火薪傳也。有一子肄業於北平商科大學，今為其父料理瑣事。每日歌唱前，食不敢飽。事畢，始進食少許。屛葷腥烟酒，以護其喉。自垂髫以迄古稀，別無嗜好，有之，唯絃索而已！當渠初次來海上時，有人　其僅能歌唱而不解音律者，劉憤然！導其人至新世界後台，則列有胡琴，琵琶，三絃，簫，笛，之屬，劉一一取而吹彈，靈活勝於老手。其人始大嘆服！渠於琵琶，尤有嗜痂之癖，且自信第一云。</p>
<p>翁又述及雙黃之創始者：姓黄名福臣，約咸同間人。其人跛一足，面目奇醜！初亦說書之流。以一人能學做各種人物動態，故名雙黄。當時俗語，有「你學一個黄福臣我看看」，其後始分為兩人學作一人也。其人好蓄　，尤嗜鼻烟。黃以後，當推徐狗子獨步。又增加蓮花落一門，更以男女為之矣。至於蓮花落，在昔歌以勸人為善者，其唱詞多採自勸善金科，並非如現時歌以博錢者也。他如八角鼓者，則係征金川時之凱歌也。此中絕無有從師學藝之說，蓋皆純為人家子弟，人如有事，則請往歌唱，不受報酬。有四句口頭禪云：義勇勝强，萬壽無疆，茶水不擾，酒食自備。不圖其後清票竟一變而為葷票。洎至晚近，更有藉此為業者矣。在昔更有唱快書之名手名魁松齋者，在北京東北城一帶，頗享盛譽，今則無從再聽此佳音矣。其人原係票友，習二黄老生，有聲於時。某年寶全，在慶豐堂祭神時，曾與同班。渠飾羣英會之魯肅，維妙維肖！一時有活魯肅之譽。如今世熊日非。回想當年歌塲勝蹟，真有不可再得之感矣！</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>余叔岩不願出演的最大原因</p>
<p>連日本刋對於叔岩行將來滬出演白宅堂會的消息，繼續刋載，頗引起社會人士之注意；甚至有許多戲迷，預備逕向白宅硬送壽禮，冀能屆時獲得一席之地，可以大飽眼耳之福。於此足證滬人對於余氏歡迎之熱烈，可謂達於極點了。不過他果否南來的確尚成一問題，記得前三年不佞寓居故鄉的時候曾有北平富商楊某為其太夫人作壽，並在前門外珠市口織雲公所預備盛大堂會，以娛佳賓；楊在平津設有參號錢莊數處，家資數百萬，當時情願拿出幾萬塊錢，邀請叔岩，小樓，硯秋，小雲等各演其傑作好戲，託人先去徵求叔岩同意，業已蒙他首肯，並且戲碼都說定准演「打棍出箱」啦。戲單印了出來，消息宣傳出去，霎時轟動九城：不知有多少戲迷朋友全都餓着肚子，老早就跑去佔着座位，台上的戲還沒開演，已經把織雲公所擠得水洩不通了，不佞偕同袁良的夫人小姐，還有市府傅秘書長老夫妻俩，事先呌前外的分局長預留幾個座位，等到公事完畢，火家連飯也沒吃好就匆匆忙忙的趕到織雲公所。我们的座位本是留在樓上的，可是樓梯上都站满了人，想登樓的人固然全上不去，同時樓上的堂客們（平市仍多男女分座，女客均在樓上，）想下樓小解的也是照樣走不下來。可憐她們困在人層裏，真有許多內急得要命的，我們既然弄到望洋興歎的地步，祇好白便宜兩名看座的巡警，很掃興的走出來了。此事在我個人原是無所謂的，因為小余的戲實在瞧得太多啦，祇拿「打棍出箱」來說，共計已聽過五次，况且配角都是金福長林這般人，不過那位傅老先生戲癮很大，看他那副神情，總還戀戀不捨，因而我們又從門東首的小巷子裏繞到後台，他們一齊擠在下塲門口，站在塲面後邊，這時才算達到目的啦。（三二）</p>

<h3>National Government Issues Official Warrant for Wang Jingwei; Frontline Generals and Public Organizations Wire Requests for Wang's Arrest; Passed After Discussion at Yesterday's Supreme National Defense Council Meeting</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Supreme National Defense Council convened today. Due to the successive wires from frontline generals, temporary provincial councils, and public organizations in various regions requesting the arrest of Wang Jingwei, totaling over a thousand, the warrant for Wang's arrest was approved after discussion and issued today by official decree. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) An order issued by the National Government on the 8th states: Wang Zhaoming violated national policy, disregarded righteousness, and at a time when the entire nation was united in resistance, he secretly abandoned his post and presumptuously advocated for peace talks. He also echoed the enemy's fallacies, hoping to incite and confuse the people, and obstruct the grand strategy. Despite being disciplined by the Central Government, he did not reflect, but acted perversely. He secretly went to Shanghai last month, willing to align himself with traitors, communicating with the enemy, and plotting subversive activities. Such actions of colluding with the enemy and harming the country clearly violate Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Recently, the people at home and abroad have been deeply indignant and have successively petitioned for his arrest and severe punishment in over a thousand cases. If the government continues to show undue leniency, how can it uphold national law and appease our military and civilians? All military and political organs throughout the country should strictly arrest him and ensure he is punished according to law to maintain discipline. This order. (Eighth Day Telegram)</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting in Southern Shanxi; Japanese Army Invades from Three Directions; All Repelled by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Yuanqu: Since the 6th, the war situation in southern Shanxi has been intense after the Japanese army invaded from three directions, unprecedented in its intensity. After the southward-fleeing Japanese army captured Lingjiao Village and Xiawu Village (south of Zhangdian), they further divided their forces to attack Shengshangjian (southeast of Lingjiao Village), Dachen Village, and Shuntou Village (south of Lingjiao). Each of the three groups of Japanese soldiers numbered over five hundred. Another group of over five hundred soldiers infiltrated Hanyao Village (west of Shengshang Village). Chinese troops advanced to meet them head-on. Another unit also attacked the flanks and rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, fled in disarray towards Dachen Village. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them and recaptured Dongdachen on the morning of the 8th. Currently, over four hundred remaining Japanese soldiers are still in Dachen, and the Chinese army is thoroughly sweeping through the area. The Japanese army that fled to Shuntou was once repelled by a Chinese unit, but the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked. Chinese and Japanese forces are currently engaged in battle southwest of Shuntou. Since the Chinese army launched a courageous counterattack and successively recaptured Shengshangjian, Hanyao Village, Dachen, and other places, morale has been greatly boosted. It will not be difficult to annihilate the Japanese army fleeing southward. As for the three thousand or so Japanese soldiers in Jiexian, they also invaded southward in two routes. One route, with over one thousand two hundred or three hundred soldiers, harassed Huanglongcen "southeast of Jiexian", and a force of five or six hundred infiltrated Longquan Village, reaching Xingdian "northwest of Pinglu". Another route, with over a thousand soldiers, fled east from Monan Town. Their vanguard of five or six hundred had already passed Xiaogounan East on the 7th. At approximately 3 a.m. on the 8th, the Japanese army invaded Pinglu from Dongpingtou "directly north of Pinglu", Xingdian "northwest of Pinglu", and Checun in three routes. Chinese units are currently intercepting them separately. (Eighth Day Telegram)</p>
<p>Tongguan: On the afternoon of the 4th, over three hundred Japanese soldiers from Feijie Town, northeast of Anyi, attacked Zhangguo and Guanzhuangbo. Chinese forces nearby laid an ambush and waited. When they approached the position, they launched a fierce pincer attack and crushed the Japanese army in one fell swoop, who fled in panic. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the Chinese army captured many spoils of war. (Seventh Day Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to frontline reports received here, fierce fighting has recently broken out between Chinese and Japanese forces in the Maojin Pinglu area on the Yellow River border in southern Shanxi. (Eighth Day Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Liulin Transfer to Chen Area</p>
<p>Since the concentred Japanese army launched a major westward offensive, with a main force of 20,000 troops, they launched a fierce attack on Qikou and Liulin from several routes. Except for the Qikou area, where they were crushed by the Chinese, the Japanese army then shifted their forces and attempted to encircle the Chinese forces in Liulin. A Chinese division engaged in intense warfare with the Japanese army on the 2nd and 3rd along Liangjiashan on both sides of the front line for hundreds of miles. On the 4th and 5th, Chinese troops continued to fight fiercely with six to seven thousand Japanese soldiers on the north and south mountain tops. The Japanese army sealed off various mountain passes with intense firepower and continuously bombed with over ten aircraft in rotation. The Chinese troops all charged and fought to the death, repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat. By the 6th, both Chinese and Japanese armies had suffered heavy casualties. It is estimated that six to seven hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Chinese side also suffered considerable losses. Chinese officers, including the regimental commander, bandaged their wounds and fought again, breaking into the Japanese army's position. The enemy aircraft could not clearly identify targets, and the artillery also had difficulty exerting its power. The Chinese army took the opportunity to repel the Japanese army. To avoid being surrounded, the Chinese forces shifted to an outer line, adopting an encircling posture. Liulin has fallen to the Japanese, but the Japanese army's flanks are all under Chinese control. Even after the Japanese army occupied Liulin, they fear they cannot gain a foothold.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Shanghai Amidst the Dramatic Exchange Rate Changes</h3>
<p>Since the dramatic changes in the Shanghai exchange market on the morning of the 7th, the market continued to decline from morning till night yesterday, gradually reaching new lows. Although reliable news from Chongqing, Hong Kong, and even London proved that there was absolutely no problem with the basis of the legal tender (fabi), and at the same time, public opinion from all sides could generally understand that this dramatic change was not an irresistible accident, but a planned measure with its own necessary significance, it is difficult to expect people in a state of blind flux to accept reason and quickly return to tranquility: finance is tied to strength, but every ripple is often greatly affected by people's hearts. This is a common example both domestically and internationally and should not be surprising. To be frightened by the current gradually declining atmosphere, suspecting that it is an irreversible and endless sign is short-sighted. If they follow the trend, compete with each other, and consider obtaining some foreign exchange as a good plan, then black market speculators and manipulators will welcome them most warmly. This is undoubtedly throwing themselves into the net, while they take advantage of the fire to rob. The foundation of the legal tender will not be threatened by this, but the dramatic changes in the exchange market will be made more severe as a result. It is a pity and not worth sympathy to waste one's resources with shortsightedness and blindness, is it not unjust?</p>
<p>In all fairness: China, as a country with backward production, is struggling in the international arena dominated by capitalism. Since its daily necessities are not self-sufficient and its self-defense needs must be purchased from abroad, it has been fighting for twenty-four months, yet its bonds can still maintain their levels, prices are still not excessively high, and its currency value has only decreased as it is now. All of these phenomena can be described as rare and valuable. This is due to the internal unity and cooperation of the government and the people, and the sympathy and assistance of friendly nations from abroad. It is by no means accidental. Now the war situation has changed from "downwind" to a stalemate, and the conditions for supplementing military strength to counterattack and win are gradually being prepared. The suffering of the people in the occupied areas proves the necessity of resisting the war for survival. The international community, with its interests and fortunes intertwined, has abandoned its thoughts of appeasement and compromise towards the aggressor and strengthened its united action against aggression. The advantages of the overall situation are clearly visible. The fate of the legal tender and the country are intertwined and inseparable. To say that the advantages of the overall situation are clear, but the legal tender is suffering a fatal blow, is something that must not happen in reality. Therefore, dramatic changes in the exchange market are not a reason for pessimism. Moreover, although this exchange market has a considerable impact on the entire China because of China's inability to provide for itself economically, the shift in the battle line in fact restricts the relationship between the general Chinese people and the international market, so the impact of the exchange market is also reduced to a minimum by this restriction. The greatest impact is on Shanghai. To put it another way: the psychological unease and the actual consumption of Shanghai due to the dramatic changes in the exchange market cannot symbolize the whole country of China. That is, what Shanghai considers serious is not as serious for the country.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been formed into an isolated island by the war. Shanghai is a pseudo international settlement and its population is dense and its daily consumption is extremely high. The destruction of industrial areas and the isolation of agricultural areas have stifled its vitality. The legal tender (fabi) is its currency while the black market of foreign exchange cannot be managed. Therefore, the rise and fall of the exchange rate of the legal tender affects all prices. Therefore, the phenomenon in the past few days has indeed made anyone living in Shanghai, regardless of wealth or nationality, directly suffer its disadvantages. If the general public lets this phenomenon develop naturally, and does not change their way of life in the past year or two, it will make the entire economic function of Shanghai move in the direction of exhaustion and despondency, and its direct and indirect bad consequences will be unspeakable and unimaginable. How can one not let it go? With the strength of Shanghai alone, raising the exchange rate is absolutely impossible. For the sake of Shanghai alone, appealing to the National Government to abandon or slow down its foreign exchange policy would have other drawbacks and is absolutely impossible. Therefore, the way to deal with this phenomenon is not in the exchange rate of foreign exchange but in daily life. Adapting life to the phenomenon is by no means a unique secret or a trick to win, but to seek it in the ordinary, and to achieve it in the ordinary. According to economic principles, the current phenomenon has its own natural development trend: one is that the relationship between supply and demand and profit will stimulate production, and the second is that the relationship between prices and capital will regulate consumption. Both of them are ordinary, and the value lies in adding a conscious driving force to the natural trend. Those engaged in production should not only develop naturally through stimulation, but must recognize the situation and catch up, and devote their intelligence and financial resources to it. Those who are not engaged in production must use their intelligence and financial resources to seek production in a timely manner. As far as consumption is concerned, it is not necessary to persuade people to spend less due to prices and unaffordable capital. However, the current situation should not only be about economizing because of high prices and the inability to afford it, but must be about economizing for the sake of cherishing one's own capital and protecting the exchange rate of the legal tender. Those who lead an excessively extravagant life have the most room for economizing, and must economize from now on. It goes without saying that they must economize on consumption related to foreign exchange. Even in middle and lower-class families, they usually seem to have done their best to economize. However, it is still not entirely true to say that every family and every person has no room for saving on food and clothing. To the extreme extent: two bowls of rice can also prevent hunger, why eat three bowls to be full? Working at sunrise and resting at sunset, why need a lamp burning low? The people's life in extraordinary times should not be ashamed of the warriors in the trenches. For the country, they sometimes cannot even get a drink to quench their thirst, while those living in Shanghai have wine or tea, and then say that saving on food and clothing is too hard?</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in the Tianjin Concession; Japan Reiterates Demands to British Authorities; Deadline to Extradite Perpetrators of Assassination of Cheng; Otherwise, Traffic Between the British Concession and the Outside World Will Be Cut Off; Japanese Commercial Institutions Ordered to Prepare to Move Out of the Concession</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Reuters has learned from reliable sources today that the Japanese side, due to the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, has sent a note verbale to the British Concession authorities, reiterating the demand for the extradition of the four perpetrators in the Cheng assassination case. It is said that a deadline of two days has been set, otherwise traffic between the British Concession and the outside world will be completely cut off. It is said that the Japanese side will block all entrances and exits of the British Concession with obstacles, preventing anyone from entering or leaving. As for food, it is said that the Japanese side will also prevent its entry. In short, the situation can be considered serious. Japanese residents held a mass meeting here today and passed a resolution demanding that punitive measures be taken against the British Concession. According to reliable sources, the Yokohama Specie Bank, located in the British Concession, has been ordered to move its office to the area occupied by the Japanese on June 14. When inquired, the Yokohama Specie Bank was unable to confirm this news. It is also said that several Japanese commercial firms operating in the British Concession have also been ordered to move out at the same time. The British authorities here believe that the evidence currently available is insufficient to justify the extradition of the four people demanded by the Japanese side, while the Japanese side claims that there is sufficient evidence that these four people committed the crime. The Japanese side recently obtained the consent of the British authorities to interrogate them, and they have confessed that they were involved in the Cheng assassination case, and were also involved in the case of killing three Japanese soldiers. (Eighth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Tianjin news received by the Japanese newspaper, since the British side refused to extradite the murderers who assassinated Cheng Xigeng in the British Concession in Tianjin on April 9, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin decided to adopt free means to suppress the gangsters there. The Japanese authorities are apparently forced by the situation and had no choice but to decide to cut off traffic between the British Concession and the outside world. The Japanese residents in Tianjin unanimously support the daily authorities' decision. Japanese merchants who used the wharves and warehouses of the British and French Concessions have now begun to move out the 50,000 tons of goods from the British and French Concessions. It is said that the harbor facilities currently concentrated in the British and French Concessions will be transferred to a certain special area downstream. At the same time, Japanese commercial institutions such as the Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsubishi Corporation, and branches of the United Reserve Bank have also decided to move out of the British and French Concessions if necessary. (Eighth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to outside reports, the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, China, have submitted a note verbale to the British Concession authorities, setting a deadline of 24 hours to extradite four Chinese suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, "Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs". Responsible persons here have no knowledge of this, and only stated that "the British Concession authorities there have decided to expel these Chinese from the Concession and have already implemented the expulsion because the evidence presented by the Japanese side is insufficient." (Eighth Day Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the Tianjin British Concession authorities' plan to hand over terrorists to the Japanese side, Chinese circles familiar with current affairs here all believe that the British side's policy of appeasement and far-reaching restraint is dangerous, and stated that this policy, which de facto recognizes the aggressor as the de facto government, is fundamentally incompatible with Britain's Far East policy. The appeasement policy has suffered tragic failures elsewhere in the world and is unlikely to be effective in the Far East. Recently, the British adopted a tough stance on the Gulangyu incident, and as a result, the arrogance of the Japanese side began to subside slightly. Today, the weak policy adopted by the British authorities in Tianjin will restart the conflict between Japan and third countries, because Japan's actions often shift according to the strength or weakness of others' attitudes. Therefore, the British side must treat the matter of handing over terrorists with extreme caution. (Eighth Day Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Claims Plane Attacked by Foreign Warship Artillery</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the incident of a certain warship southeast of Hong Kong firing on a Japanese passenger plane on Wednesday morning, Tokyo has not yet received official information. Some say that the warship was perhaps engaged in drills, resulting in this misunderstanding.

<h3>British Foreign Office Central European Director Flies to Moscow with New Proposal; Baltic States Security Issue to Use Separate Declaration; Soviet Union Releases Reply to Britain and France</h3>
<p>(London) According to information obtained by a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, Sterling, Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, will be dispatched to Moscow. According to Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday, the special envoy to the Soviet Union will accelerate British-Soviet talks. Sterling recently traveled to Warsaw in a private capacity and met with British Minister to Poland, Sir Conrad. He has now begun his return. He has been involved in all developments and negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, he is being sent to the Soviet Union to explain government instructions to British Ambassador Sir Seeds.</p>
<p>According to diplomatic sources, a mutually satisfactory plan for the British, French, and Soviet governments has now been established. The content includes mutual guarantees when the vital interests of any party are threatened by aggression. A separate declaration will specify matters that each country considers vital. Thus, if the Soviet Union declares the territorial integrity and political independence of the Baltic States as vital, the guarantee of these countries will be reviewed, and efforts will be made to eliminate the objections of these countries to being guaranteed. Officials believe that there are no major difficulties in seeking a solution that reconciles all conflicting opinions. The Soviet Union's fully reciprocal proposals have already been agreed to by Britain and France. Sterling is scheduled to leave here by plane on Friday and arrive in Moscow on Saturday or Sunday. It is expected that the British-Soviet talks will be fully settled within the next week. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Sterling, Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, was ordered by his government to go to the Soviet Union to assist Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, in negotiations with the Soviet Union. He took a plane at 9 PM tonight to return to London for instructions and to report on the results of his talks with the Polish authorities. During his stay in Poland, Sterling visited the Free City of Danzig and met with Dr. Burckhardt, the High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in the city. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) "Pravda" recently published an article titled "Questions of Foreign Policy," which stated, "Recently, foreign newspapers have been competing to discuss the Soviet Union's foreign policy, and have paid attention to the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Britain and France. It is well known that after Molotov's speech at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on May 31, the Soviet government sent its own proposal, namely an amendment to the British and French proposals, to the British and French governments. This proposal is fully consistent with the position elucidated by Molotov in his speech to the Supreme Soviet, which explained the minimum conditions for the Soviet side regarding the organization of a front to guarantee peace in Europe and prevent further aggression. The main points are as follows: First, the British, French, and Soviet Union should conclude a strong pact of mutual assistance against aggression. Second, the Soviet Union is willing to provide assistance to the five countries that Britain and France have already guaranteed assistance to in the event of aggression. Third, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should provide assistance if the neutrality of the three Baltic countries is violated by aggressors. Fourth, concrete agreements should be signed regarding the methods, forms, and scope of assistance. The characteristic of the current stage of British, French, and Soviet negotiations is that the Soviet proposal not only reflects the position of the Soviet government, but also expresses the will of the Supreme Soviet. Foreign newspapers have paid special attention to the latest Soviet proposal, presumably because of this." (7th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Explains Attitude Towards Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons today regarding the British-Soviet negotiations, saying that the government could not report the daily progress of the British-Soviet negotiations to the House. However, the current stage reached can supplement the statement of May 24. Judging from the recent exchange of views with the Soviet Union, various main objectives seem to be able to reach a general compromise. The British government has been able to satisfy the Soviet Union. Britain is prepared to conclude a pact based on full reciprocity and has stated that if the Soviet Union encounters any aggression that causes it to engage in war with European powers, Britain is prepared to immediately unite with France and provide the Soviet Union with full military assistance without any reservations. The full military assistance agreed upon by the three countries is not limited to actual aggression against their own territory. Therefore, there are various situations that may cause any of the three governments to feel that their security is indirectly threatened by the actions of other European powers. The British government has carefully studied this situation. He hopes to recommend a plan that can be accepted by all three governments. Because this plan concerns the interests of other countries, it will naturally obtain the cooperation of countries resisting aggression. There are still one or two difficult points that need to be resolved, namely, certain countries that are unwilling to accept guarantees, saying that such guarantees will endanger their neutrality that they want to maintain. We obviously cannot force countries that are unwilling to accept guarantees. However, he hopes to find a way to prevent this difficulty and any resistance it may cause from hindering the principle of mutual assistance to resist aggression from exerting its maximum effect. In order to accelerate the negotiations with the Soviet Union, the British government has decided to send a representative from the Foreign Office to Moscow to convey the British government's attitude towards the outstanding issues in detail to Sir Seeds, the ambassador to the Soviet Union. He hopes that by doing so, the discussion of adjusting the opinions of the three countries can be completed quickly and reach a final compromise. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Labor Party member Greenwood, saying that the government has not yet decided who will be sent to Moscow. However, the purpose of this move is to facilitate and accelerate the progress of negotiations, and not to delay them. (7th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Hitler Secretly Conspires; Japan Sends Long Telegrams to Germany</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although Hitler will leave Berlin for Berchtesgaden for a vacation in the coming days, judging from the situation, he will still closely monitor the international situation. The fact that a large number of personnel from the Prime Minister's Office are accompanying him proves that those who expect German political activities to be temporarily quiet will be disappointed. Furthermore, the fact that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will remain in Berlin is also noteworthy. According to sources, the exchange of views between Germany, Italy, and Spain has reached a certain stage. If the Soviet Union and Britain and France compromise, the three countries can take immediate countermeasures. A large number of Spanish generals have now arrived in Berlin and are frequently in contact with German military and political leaders. Also, there are clearly important consultations between Berlin and Tokyo, and Rome and Tokyo also seem to be taking the same actions. Japanese sources said that two long telegrams arrived from Tokyo last night, containing new Japanese proposals to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a closer political tool. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Japanese Embassy in Germany received two long coded telegrams from Tokyo last night. Ambassador Oshima immediately convened a secret discussion with the naval and military attachés of the embassy today. According to well-informed sources, Germany and Italy advocate strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact to cope with the mutual assistance agreement negotiated by Britain and the Soviet Union. The Japanese government has therefore put forward new proposals. Ambassador Oshima will meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in the coming days to discuss the matter. The Japanese here are tight-lipped about the contents of the telegrams, only asking Ambassador Oshima to be determined to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact and willing to further change it into a military alliance. This Japanese proposal is mostly based on the ambassador's views. It is rumored that Ambassador Oshima may be recalled to his country, which is completely untrue. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>(New York) The "New York People's Forum" correspondent in Tokyo cabled yesterday that the Japanese five-minister conference has decided that Japan is preparing to negotiate with Germany and Italy to sign a limited military alliance to represent Japan's greatest contribution to consolidating the Rome-Berlin Axis. The details of the military alliance that Japan is preparing to sign have not been announced. However, it is rumored that it stipulates that if the Soviet Union joins the war, Japan will take military action. However, it is undecided whether the Japanese navy will participate in the war if Germany and Italy engage in war with democratic countries in the Mediterranean. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Britain Strengthens Military Liaison with Guaranteed Countries; Plans to Extend Credit Loans; Representatives from Romania and Turkey Arrive in London</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain made a general statement on the progress of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. He said that the governments of Finland, Latvia, and Estonia recently informed the British government that they "wish to strictly adhere to neutrality and therefore do not wish to accept the guarantees currently negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union." A Member of Parliament then asked the Prime Minister whether the British General Staff had conducted talks with the General Staff of the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, or whether there were any plans to do so. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that maintaining contact between the General Staff of the countries concerned is a regular practice for military attachés of embassies to liaise with the military authorities of the host country. In recent months, this method has been supplemented for the sake of certain countries, and efforts should be made to supplement it uniformly in the future. However, for the benefit of the public, details should not be disclosed. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Financial circles here have recently stated that Britain will provide credit loans to guaranteed countries to expand their military equipment and resist aggression. Therefore, the maximum limit of export credit loans may be increased from the current £35 million to £60 million or even £70 million. As of now, a total of £23 million has been released. The distribution is as follows: Greece £2 million, Turkey £16 million, Romania £5 million, and it has been decided to lend £5 million to Poland. However, it is heard that Poland needs a total of £6 million. In any case, it will inevitably exceed £5 million. As a result, the loan amount for Romania will also be increased. Based on this, the original amount of £35 million is felt to be insufficient, and it is necessary to increase it. The British government will establish a special agency to handle this matter, and it is also possible that representatives from the countries concerned will participate. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, representatives from Britain and Romania are negotiating various technical issues regarding the £5 million credit loan that Britain is providing to Romania. This loan is purely commercial in nature, with an annual interest rate of 5.5%. In addition, the British side believes that the exchange rate of the Romanian currency against the mark has increased due to the German-Romanian trade agreement, reducing the price when Romania purchases German goods, and also making it easier for German goods to develop in the Romanian market. For the sake of commercial competition, Britain should revise the exchange rate between Britain and Romania. This matter is under discussion. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Regarding the Situation in Spain, Britain Has No Intention of Negotiating with Italy; Chamberlain Reports in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a lengthy statement on the Spanish situation in the House of Commons today, stating that after considering all circumstances, the government does not wish to raise any negotiations with the Italian government unless the overall situation has undergone significant changes due to new developments. The Prime Minister continued to answer supplementary questions, saying that there has been no violation of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. 20,000 Italian soldiers and 6,000 German soldiers have left Spain. This number accounts for most of the foreign troops stationed in Spain. The Italian air force on the island of Majorca is currently being reduced. Some Italians have left the island, and the rest will leave soon. Regarding the Germans at the air force base on the island, only two remain. The main purpose of the exchange of notes before the establishment of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was to prevent Italy from inducing the Spanish government to provide bases, allowing war supplies to remain there and be guarded by Italians. According to current information, the Italian army has now withdrawn, so the main purpose can be said to have been achieved. (7th Reuters)</p>

<h3>American Medical Bureau for Aid to China Plans to Purchase Quinine, Initiates Chinese Food Luncheons</h3>
<p>(New York) The American Medical Bureau for Aid to China, which previously launched a fundraising campaign to purchase quinine and ship it to China to treat refugees, stated in its fundraising appeal, "Malaria and other epidemics spread by mosquitoes are rampant throughout China. If they are not quickly eradicated, they will weaken China's resistance even more than Japanese bombs." The bureau then established a subsidiary committee, chaired by Mrs. Hume, former president of Yale-in-China University in Changsha, to initiate Chinese food luncheons for American adults. These luncheons are held twice a month and are also promoted among American children, with a Mrs. Zhu serving as the chair of the children's luncheon committee. The method involves having the children of prominent overseas Chinese youth take turns hosting, inviting American children to enjoy Chinese food together, using chopsticks exclusively. Those unfamiliar with chopsticks are given temporary instruction by the Chinese children. Each guest pays seventy-five cents, with twenty-five cents donated to purchase quinine and the remainder used for meal expenses. Guests can also visit Chinatown and Chinese temples, with guides providing explanations of Chinese stories. The most recent luncheon was held on the twenty-seventh of this month at the Lvshun Restaurant in Chinatown. The hosts were the three daughters of the famous Chinese writer Lin Yutang, assisted by several children of Mr. Wang Zhengxu, manager of the Bank of China branch in New York. According to Mrs. Zhu, the chair of the luncheon, "Chinese food is very popular among American children." (Havas Air Communication)</p>

<h3>Exhibition of Chinese Antiques Held in New York</h3>
<p>(New York) Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., daughter-in-law of the former president, recently joined with the Chinese Women's Relief Committee here to launch an exhibition of Chinese antiques, which will run from May 16th to October 28th. All proceeds will be used as relief funds for the orphans of Chinese war dead. The venue displays a dazzling array of ancient and precious items, including an eight-foot-high jade pagoda and a gilded throne from the Forbidden City, as well as six models of wooden palaces, all of which are rarely seen outside China. The gilded throne alone is valued at two million US dollars. When it was shipped here, there were rumors that it had been lost. After searching for several hours, it was finally found in a wooden box in a warehouse in Oakland, California. It turns out that the gilded throne was secretly shipped through the Soviet Union to the capital of the Netherlands, and then transported to this place by the Dutch American Line steamship "Charm Dan". When the ship arrived in this port and began unloading, the wooden boxes containing the throne and precious plates were all checked and found to be complete, but the throne was nowhere to be found. Officials, police, and even personnel from the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched for several hours without any results. It was not until a reply telegram was received from the capital of the Netherlands that it was learned that the shipping company's manager had mistakenly thought that Oakland was near New York and had shipped the throne to that port, thus it was found after tracing it. The mystery was then solved. (Havas Air News, 8th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Declares that Far East Policy Remains Unchanged, House of Commons Discusses Various Incidents in Shanghai, British Ambassador to Japan Protests Repeatedly</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a written reply to Conservative MP Milner in the House of Commons today that the British government's policy on the Far Eastern situation has been detailed in the note to the Japanese government on January 24th. He regrets that he is too busy to have a special debate on the issues raised by this question, but he fully recognizes the importance of the situation and will certainly raise it for discussion when holding a general debate on foreign affairs. If Mr. Milner wishes to know more details on any point, he will do his best to provide a detailed reply. Mr. Milner's question to the Prime Minister was regarding when the government will publish a general statement on its policy to deal with Japan's plans for foreign concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xiamen, Japan's seizure or detention of British merchant ships, and the blockade of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, prohibiting foreign ships from navigating, and provide an opportunity for debate. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, several members raised questions on the Far Eastern issue. Conservative MP Sir Milner asked Prime Minister Chamberlain that the Japanese customs officer in Shanghai once issued a notice stating that all ships sailing to certain ports in the interior must obtain permission from the Japanese naval authorities before being allowed to clear customs and set sail. He asked whether the Prime Minister had reviewed this notice and what measures had been taken to deal with it. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately gave a written reply on behalf of the Prime Minister, stating, "The Shanghai Customs seems to have issued a notice at the request of the so-called 'Nanjing Reformed Government,' stating that all ships sailing to nine ports after June 1st must obtain a certificate from the Japanese authorities in advance before being allowed to clear customs. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has been instructed to negotiate with the Japanese government, informing them that the British government sees no reason to require ships to obtain a permit from military authorities before clearing customs, and requesting that the authorities in China be instructed not to insist on this proposal." Labour MP Mr. Bellenger then raised a question, stating that Japanese marines had forcibly entered the Hongkou Public Hospital on April 24th of this year. The British Consul in Shanghai had submitted a report on this matter. He asked whether the Prime Minister would issue a statement on this matter. Mr. Butler immediately replied on behalf of the government, stating briefly, "This hospital is located in Hongkou, and the Hongkou area is under the control of the Japanese Marines. There was no forced entry on that day. In fact, a Japanese marine was injured and died in a car accident, so a team of marines went to the hospital to request to meet with those injured but not dead in the car accident, leading to a dispute with a British police officer, Mr. Samson, of the Public Concession Police Force, and a Japanese officer punched him. The British Consul and the Shanghai Municipal Council have protested to the Japanese Consul." Bellenger then asked, "Is this a British hospital, and can we take various measures to protect British staff who need to be admitted for various reasons?" Butler then replied, "The purpose of the protest is to prevent similar incidents from happening again." Bellenger continued, "Will the government take effective measures to protect the lives of the people in the hospital?" Butler replied, "We will certainly do our best to protect the lives of the British people." Conservative MP Mr. Sanderman asked whether the Prime Minister knew that Britons going to Hankou had been required by the Japanese side to obtain a pass. He asked whether the British authorities agreed to this measure and whether the Prime Minister could order diplomatic and naval authorities in China to fight for the right of British subjects to freely enter Hankou. Butler replied, "Anyone going to Hankou and ports upstream of Shanghai is required to obtain a pass issued by the Japanese military authorities. The British authorities have prevented this, so that British subjects can go to various ports along the Yangtze River. In principle, we do not recognize the right of the Japanese side to restrict or monitor the actions of British subjects. This matter has been clearly stated to the Japanese government by the British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, reserving our rights." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Advocates Thrift, Abolishes Extravagant Wedding Banquets, Prohibits Students from Growing Hair</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Vice-Minister of Health and Welfare Okada recently urged the abolition of extravagant wedding banquets and the prohibition of students growing hair, which is related to the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. The purpose of this movement is to reform the public and private lives of Japanese people to cope with wartime conditions. Okada also suggested limiting formal attire for weddings, formal dress for morning meetings, and formal attire for official worship at shrines, abolishing neon lights in entertainment venues, setting the closing time for geisha houses, hotels, bars, and cafes at 10:00 p.m., and abolishing the exchange of gifts during New Year's and other seasons. Okada also believes that not only wedding banquets but also other seasonal banquets should be banned. Japanese students should shave their hair and wear unified uniforms. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry Restructuring Plan Approved by the Privy Council</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council has approved the restructuring plan of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The government plans to implement it on June 15th. It is expected that after the restructuring, the ministry will have the posture of a munitions ministry and will focus on expanding the productivity of various industries, national mobilization of goods, promoting export trade, and controlling goods and prices. In addition, a councilor's office will be established in the ministry's General Affairs Bureau, Mining Bureau, Iron and Steel Bureau, Chemical Bureau, Machinery Bureau, Control Bureau, Textile Bureau, and Industrial Development Bureau, with army and navy officers serving as councilors to discuss all matters related to national mobilization with ministry officials at any time and serve as liaisons between the ministry and the fighting armies.

<h3>New Gas Mask Factory Established in Java Can Produce 3,000 Masks Daily</h3>
<p>Bandung, Java A gas mask factory capable of manufacturing 3,000 masks per day has been completed in Bandung and will be fully operational within the next few weeks, fulfilling a recent contract with the Dutch East Indies military to supply a large number of masks. The new factory occupies several acres and will employ 250 workers. All raw materials for manufacturing gas masks, except for necessary chemicals, will be supplied locally. In addition to military gas masks, special masks for civilians have also been designed. Large-scale production will begin after government final approval on the safety and durability of these masks. It is reported that Europeans will pay for their own gas masks if they are necessary, but their price is far beyond the reach of ordinary Javanese. In times of emergency, they may need to be distributed free of charge to natives in vulnerable areas. The new factory in Bandung is related to the gas mask factory in Singapore, which has been supplying gas masks to British troops stationed in Malaya for some time and has a significant business in Siam and other neighboring countries. It is reported that after the completion of the Bandung factory, exports can be expanded. The factory is a Dutch enterprise working with its own patented methods, but a large amount of British equipment has been installed in the factory. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Measures for Yi Affairs in Ning Province, Xikang Province Authorities Decide to Use Political Influence to Win Them Over</h3>
<p>Kangding Correspondence The nationalities of Kang and Ning Provinces are very complex. The people of Kang Province are relatively pure because they worship Buddhism, and government decrees can still be implemented. However, the uncivilized Yi people of Ning Province are extremely fierce, making them difficult to govern. It is said that the Yi people were originally from the Pu tribe, also known as the Luoluo. After research by Chinese historians and overseas scholars such as Stephenson and Buckton, there is still no definitive answer as to their origin. However, it is considered that the theory that they are an inherent Chinese ethnic group is correct. The Luoyi, centered on the Greater Liang Mountains, are distributed in more than a dozen counties along the Jinsha River, Dadu River, Lema Ping'e, and Ning Province, all of which have strong forces. It is generally estimated that there are no less than one million raw, cooked, white, and black Yi people. Because of their fierce customs and unruly nature, the rulers of the past have generally regarded them as people outside the realm of civilization. Examining historical records, since the Shu Kingdom expelled the Fen people, the Yi people have been regarded as a major national problem in all dynasties. They were either conquered by force, pacified by education, divided land and guarded each other, or granted titles and held in check. In short, policies of suppression and pacification were implemented, but the Yi people were cunning and treacherous, and their rebellions were unpredictable, and they were ultimately unable to make them submit and happily return. Moreover, their forces grew and spread, and the incidents of attacking cities and looting towns, robbing and killing merchants, and driving out Han Chinese to occupy land increased with the times. In the past, even with the wealth of resources and the strength of the military in Sichuan Province, it was still difficult to achieve the effect of suppression and pacification. The severity of the problem can be imagined. In the past, although garrison troops were set up to prevent them from leaving their nests, hoping for temporary peace, there was never an active assimilation plan to achieve a permanent solution. As a result, the country had more than one million honest and brave Yi people who could not be utilized. On the contrary, because of their looting, not only were the Han Chinese unable to sleep peacefully, but also the local resources could not be developed. It is truly regrettable. After the Xikang Provincial Government took over Ning Province, it realized the mistakes of the past passive policies and urgently needed to correct them. During the current period of full-scale resistance against Japan, in order to meet the needs of rear defense construction, it has adopted an active policy, deciding to thoroughly assimilate the Yi people and completely establish governance in the Yi areas. The steps to be taken are to first send capable troops to conquer the stubborn and bloodthirsty uncivilized Yi people, in order to establish prestige, and then use political power to persuade and influence them. Since Jingbian Commander Deng Xiuting led his troops to suppress the uncivilized Yi people in Ning Province, the fierce Yi bandits in the Xichang to Ningnan area have gradually been wiped out. The remaining Yi remnants have surrendered one after another and are willing to sit as hostages as a sign of trust. According to recent intelligence from Ning Province, the Xining Avenue has been completely cleared. It is reported that Provincial Chairman Liu Wenhui plans to inspect Ning Province from Kangding in the near future to guide the assimilation of the Yi people in the area and promote the establishment of governance in the Yi areas. The reporter recently visited the provincial government and interviewed Liu Wenhui, asking about the implementation policies and methods for Yi affairs. Liu said that there are more than one million Yi people in Ning Province. They have no religion, no written language, and their actions are no different from savages. They have been a problem on the border for a long time. Since suppression and pacification have been implemented, the Xining Avenue has recently been completely cleared. We are now advancing towards Huili. Once the Xi-Hui Road is open, we will plan to open the road to Yuejun. In the future, we plan to gradually change the Yi areas of Huili, Yanyuan, and Yanbian from indigenous rule to civilian rule. Because the area is very vast, it can be divided into a dozen counties. In handling Yi affairs, we will focus on politics. The newly organized Xikang Provincial Ning Province Reclamation Committee is now an important political institution. As for Liu Min's tour of Ning Province, he plans to first go to Hanyuanchang to preside over the training of the Bao-Xun-He-Yi cadre training class, which is scheduled to last for one month, and then go directly to Xichang to inspect the counties of Ning Province and supervise Yi affairs and reclamation matters.</p>
<h3>Suspected Japanese Troops in Guangdong Planning to Advance Southeast from Jiangmen and Xinhui; Chinese Troops Have Already Taken Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing Dispatch: The war situation in Guangdong Province, particularly in the Dongjiang, Beijiang, and Xijiang areas, has remained in a stalemate recently. However, in the Jiangmen and Xinhui area in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, there have been frequent skirmishes in the past ten days. These have mainly been encounters between forward scouts or attacks by Chinese guerrillas on Japanese troops. The Japanese troops in Xinhui are still holding onto the county seat, setting up artillery positions on the mountains outside the city to protect its periphery. Frontline troops are stationed near Shatiqiao, Xilongqiao, and the Fen Shui River. Chinese troops have advanced to the opposite bank of the Fen Shui River, closely encircling the Japanese forces. The Japanese troops in Jiangmen, due to insufficient manpower, have shrunk their defensive line to the areas of Mulang Village and Duruan, concentrating their main force at Fozi'ao and Jiushe. Chinese troops, occupying the strategically important Jingkou and Jinggen, inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese at Jingkou. To this day, the Japanese dare not directly advance, only sending tank convoys and cavalry to sneak into the vicinity of Jingkou to probe the strength of the Chinese forces. The Jiang-Fo Highway could originally directly connect to Heshan Shaping, but after the Japanese troops failed in Shaping, some fled back to Jiangmen, leaving no trace of the Japanese army on the Jiang-Fo Highway. After the Chinese troops recovered the road, they immediately destroyed the roadbed section by section, preventing the Japanese tank convoys from advancing again. In recent days, they have only dispatched sentries to guard Shuanglongxu and Baitudi. The above-mentioned locations are no more than ten miles away from Jiangmen, and Jiangmen has no natural defenses. Japanese steel cannons have been moved to Beijie, ready to be transported to Japanese warships for escape in an emergency. It is rumored that the Japanese have built an airfield near Jiangmen, with several aircraft assisting the army in defense.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese troops in Xinhui and Jiangmen seem to have abandoned plans to advance into Heshan, and are instead embarking on a large-scale roundabout strategy. Their plan is to invade from the southeast of Xinhui, attempting to seize Danshui Estuary in Kaiping and directly approach Sanbu (Xinchang, Dihai, Changsha), then enter Enping and break through Liangyang (Yangjiang, Yangchun). On April 30th, they once sent several motorboats to launch a surprise attack along the outer sea of Xinhui, but were met with a head-on counterattack by the Chinese troops in the Niuwan and Yinzhou Lake area. Mechanized units unleashed their power. After an hour of artillery bombardment, the Japanese motorboats were unable to withstand the attack and retreated one after another. As the Japanese Marines suffered casualties, they dispatched twelve aircraft for cover. Japanese troops from Xinhui City bypassed Guifeng Mountain and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese troops' positions on Luhu Mountain. Chinese troops, relying on the strategic importance of the mountain, deployed artillery units to intercept the Japanese forces everywhere. The two sides held each other until the morning of the 30th, but the Japanese troops ultimately failed. However, the Tuyacun area near the mountain has been bombed by Japanese aircraft and reduced to scorched earth.</p>
<p>To prevent the Japanese from invading the southern part of Xinhui City, the military authorities are now reinforcing the defensive fortifications in Kaiping. In addition to thoroughly destroying the highways, they have recently blockaded the waterways in Shuangshui, Qibao, Niuwan, and other places. The ferries that normally travel between Kaiping Sanbu and Macau-Qianshan have been severely hindered. Following a request from shipping merchants, a river surface of only ten to a dozen feet wide was left unblocked for passage. However, only a few boats can travel to Shizui. The pontoon bridges built on the river surface in peacetime have now been completely dismantled. The foundations along both banks of the river have long been leveled into deep holes, each hole being seven to eight feet deep, making it difficult for Japanese tanks to cross. Mines have been pre-laid in the strategic areas of the river. Gongyibu, which is adjacent to Danshui Estuary, also has considerable defenses. The militia from Taishan, Kaiping, and Chixi counties have been ordered by their superiors to intensify training and concentrate at various strongholds, ready to be dispatched when necessary.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Kunshan Forcing the Use of Fake Currency; Many Shops Have Closed Down as a Result</h3>
<p>Kunshan Dispatch: Since the establishment of the puppet Huaxing Bank, Masuda, the Japanese pacification squad leader in Kunshan, has been ordered by the Japanese intelligence agency in Suzhou to promote the use of the bank's fake currency. The puppet county government is also cooperating in this effort. Those who disobey the order will be severely punished, even facing the risk of death. Under these harsh circumstances, ordinary merchants have no choice but to passively accept their fate. However, they dare not accept this unreliable fake currency, and many have closed their doors as a result. Even those who remain in business mostly comply in appearance but resist in secret. Therefore, Kunshan's commerce has been extremely chaotic recently. Moreover, the market is flooded with Japanese military scrip, which has become a source of great distress for ordinary merchants.</p>
<h3>Thriving Fishing Season in Yuhuan Leads to Salt Shortage; Salt Scarcity Imminent</h3>
<p>Wenling Dispatch: Due to an exceptionally thriving fishing season this spring, fishermen in various districts of Yuhuan County need salt urgently, both for fresh sales and for curing fish for later sale. They have repeatedly attempted to purchase salt from the fishery salt collection and transportation stations in the various fishing areas under the jurisdiction of Wenling, but have been informed that supplies have been exhausted. This is creating a situation of salt scarcity. Furthermore, fishermen in Kanmen Town of Yuhuan County have been without salt from the local fishery station for over ten days, making it impossible to cure their fish. This coincides with the plum rain season, making the fish prone to spoilage. The fishermen feel resentment because it is a matter of vital importance to their livelihoods. The collection and transportation station, the fishermen's association, the chamber of commerce, the town office, and various organizations have jointly sent a telegram to the provincial government on May 23rd, requesting that the Third District Fishery Salt Management Office and the Kanmen Fishery Salt Branch be instructed to consider the plight of the fishermen and release fishery salt in order to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jiangyin Demolish the Three Dukes Shrine Because It Represents National History</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Dispatch: Inside the East Gate of Jiangyin, there is a Qixia Lane, where the Three Dukes Shrine is located (on the original site of the ancient Qixia Temple). Facing the Lin Kang Pond, the Three Dukes Shrine commemorates Yan Yingyuan, Chen Mingyu, and Xu Yong, local officials and scholars who defended the isolated city for more than eighty days against the Qing army at the end of the Ming Dynasty, and ultimately died at the Gu Lou Qixia Temple. Later generations, in recognition of their loyalty and valor, established the shrine to commemorate them. The shrine housed wooden tablets of Yan, Chen, and Xu, and their descendants would hold public祭 ceremonies every spring and autumn. A pair of couplets, written by Yan before his death, hung in the shrine: "For eighty days, we showed loyalty with our hair uncut, representing the seventeen reigns of Emperor Taizu; One hundred thousand people died righteously, leaving three hundred miles of rivers and mountains to Great Ming." The words "died righteously" were originally changed due to the Qing court's relations after the killing of the traitors. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the late Qing Dynasty, the Three Dukes Shrine was converted into the private Fuyan Elementary School, and it has remained so for nearly thirty years. When Jiangyin City fell two years ago, the Three Dukes Shrine was occupied by Japanese troops, but the buildings were fortunately preserved. Recently, the Japanese troops, deeming the shrine to represent national heroes from history, which conflicted with their aggressive ambitions, specifically destroyed the wooden tablets and couplets. The three halls of the shrine have also been demolished.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Prices Soar in Wuxi, Exceeding 100 Yuan Per Load; Puppet Authorities Establish Bureau to Collect Taxes</h3>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: Since the 4th of this month, the silk cocoon market in Wuxi has reached a peak, and prices have also soared. Because the cost of mulberry leaves for silkworm farmers is very high, they are unwilling to sell at low prices. Therefore, even if the cocoon merchants do not want to raise prices, it is impossible. Prices in the southern districts of Wuxi have exceeded 100 yuan, while prices in the northeastern districts have also reached 90 yuan. Silkworm farmers are all overjoyed. The puppet Finance Department relies heavily on taxes from the transportation of dried cocoons. However, since most cocoon merchants are located in rural areas, which are mostly controlled by guerrillas, collection is difficult. Therefore, they came up with another solution, appointing Hu Zengyan, the puppet director of the Dried Cocoon Business Bureau, and establishing a bureau at No. 1 Suo Alley in the city, designating Wuxi as the collection point for dried cocoons. Puppet tax collection stations were also set up at Huangbudun, the railway station, Qingming Bridge, and Huinong Bridge, stipulating that every dried cocoon boat passing through would be charged three yuan per unit, with a 95% deduction and calculation. Cocoon merchants are also required to truthfully declare and re-weigh their goods, otherwise they will be penalized with a triple levy. In Suzhou, another puppet tax collection office has been established, with Wang Wengang serving as the puppet director. They specialize in inspecting all strategic locations on land and water where Japanese and puppet forces can reach, in order to satisfy their desire for plunder.</p>

<h3>Overview of Vocational Education in China: Continued Revision and Expansion of Curriculum Standards; Additional Funding for Supplementary Schools</h3>
<p>Curriculum and Equipment: In October of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Ministry of Education formulated a general outline of teaching subjects and class hours for various vocational school departments. At the elementary level, there were six departments related to agriculture, twenty-one related to industry, three related to commerce, and five related to domestic affairs. At the advanced level, there were six departments related to agronomy, eleven related to industry, seven related to commerce, and five related to domestic affairs, for a total of sixty-one departments. In addition, subjects could be added and promulgated successively as needed based on actual circumstances.</p>
<p>After the publication of the aforementioned subject and class hour schedule, the Ministry of Education commissioned experts in various fields and vocational schools with outstanding achievements to compile curriculum tables, teaching material outlines, and equipment summaries for each department based on the aforementioned principles. However, due to the difficulty in determining curriculum standards for each department, and the fact that new tools and equipment were being invented continuously, making it impossible to prescribe them rigidly, the Ministry first issued four volumes of "Compilation of Curriculum Tables, Teaching Material Outlines, and Equipment Summaries for Various Vocational School Departments" in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic (1934 and 1935) for reference by the provinces and cities in their implementation.</p>
<p>In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), in view of the difficulties encountered by vocational schools across the country in implementation, the Ministry of Education designated vocational schools with outstanding achievements to conduct curriculum research. It first formulated curriculum and equipment standards for civil engineering, machinery, electrical engineering, and telecommunications, which were promulgated and implemented in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). The revised teaching subject and class hour schedule for elementary and advanced agricultural vocational schools was also promulgated at the same time. In addition, curriculum and equipment standards for other departments are still being revised.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), in view of the increasing expansion of ordinary middle schools and the increasing neglect of productive education, and according to the statistics for the 21st year of the Republic (1932), which showed that there were only 262 vocational schools nationwide, accounting for only one-tenth of the total number of secondary schools, the Ministry of Education formulated standards for the establishment and funding of secondary schools in the provinces and cities. Middle schools were allocated 40% of the total secondary education funds, normal schools were allocated 25%, and vocational schools were allocated no less than 35%. This standard was to be gradually reached within four years (by the 26th year of the Republic (1937)). Any new funds for secondary education in the provinces and cities in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) should be used primarily for vocational school funding. Those that could not increase their funding should gradually reduce the corresponding amount of middle school funding from the existing funds to expand vocational education.</p>
<p>In the same year, because the provinces and cities were striving to expand vocational schools but lacked clear implementation steps, the Ministry of Education formulated twelve articles on the procedures for promoting vocational education in the provinces and cities. These articles stipulated that the types of departments established in vocational schools should focus on improving local traditional handicrafts and utilizing local existing enterprises or raw materials to develop new industries. It also ordered the formation of a Vocational Education Design Committee to discuss and formulate implementation plans, and to consult with the construction departments and bureaus to discuss cooperative measures to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the Ministry of Education formulated a general outline of measures for promoting vocational supplementary education in the provinces and cities, and ordered all middle schools and above to establish vocational supplementary schools attached to their respective departments, based on their departments' nature, equipment, and personnel. All vocational organizations should also run various industry supplementary classes in cooperation with schools.</p>

<h3>Restricting the Supply of Black Market Foreign Exchange to Prevent Japanese Speculation; Exchange Rates Continued to Tighten Yesterday Morning; The Central Bank's Official Exchange Rate Remained Unchanged; Chaotic Situation Expected to Stabilize Soon</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's Hong Kong dispatch, dated the 8th: Hong Kong banks were closed on the 8th, and there was no foreign exchange market. Many banks eagerly purchased legal tender. The morning rate was 475, rising slightly in the afternoon. Zhong Daqing, chairman of the Financial and Trade Field, stated that the Foreign Exchange Administration's suspension of foreign exchange sales was to combat Japanese conspiracies and would not affect China's financial foundation. The price of Hong Kong dollars fell slightly due to a slight reduction in buyers. (8th Dispatch) (Associated Press, New York, 7th) According to the exchange market listing here today, the price of Shanghai currency has fallen sharply, with a closing price of 4.75, which is 1.40 lower than the closing price on June 6th. It is reported that the reason for the decline in Chinese currency is actually due to the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Administration's suspension of foreign exchange supply. Another report states that the Hong Kong legal tender continued to fall to 465 at the noon closing on the 8th.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 7th) The Times commented on the Chinese Currency Stabilization Fund's suspension of assistance to the legal tender's exchange rate of 8 1/4 pence, saying that rumors that most of the fund had been lost were absurd. However, it has now become clear that the demand for foreign exchange purchased with legal tender at the recent price of 8 1/4 pence is excessive and cannot be met in the long term. The Fund Committee has decided that rather than lowering the exchange rate, it is better to temporarily not assist the exchange market and allow it to set its own price. When the time is right, the Fund Committee will set a lower new price and take necessary measures to avoid excessive fluctuations. From China's point of view, a precisely defined exchange rate is of course very important, so the new price should be realized quickly.</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, London, 8th) Due to the Exchange Equalization Fund's suspension of foreign exchange supply, the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender against the British pound has fallen from 8 1/4 pence to 6 5/8 pence. The general impression here is that the Chinese authorities will allow the legal tender to reach a level that suits its economic situation, and will only intervene when there are drastic changes. After the fall in the exchange rate of the legal tender, China's foreign trade should be positively affected, and the overall result of foreign trade can also be improved to some extent.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Hong Kong, 8th) Responsible parties today issued a statement to Reuters explaining the reason why the Sino-British Equalization Fund is temporarily not assisting legal tender, saying that it is well known that the Equalization Fund has not been under pressure in the past few weeks. The general public's trust in legal tender remains unshaken. However, the Fund temporarily stopped providing assistance on Wednesday to allow the legal tender exchange rate to be better aligned with economic prices and promote trade balance. We should remember that the same steps were taken in June 1938, and the exchange rate was successfully maintained at 8 1/4 pence for 12 months. It is now believed that a new price has been obtained and can be strongly maintained. Many foreign goods that were previously imported are now being manufactured domestically, and there is hope for a good harvest of agricultural products, so imports can also be reduced. A method has now been agreed upon so that the government's foreign exchange needs for purchasing arms and other supplies can be met without entering the foreign exchange market. The Equalization Fund has been strengthened, and efforts to expand the foundation of this fund have also been successful, so there is no doubt about the authorities' ability to maintain foreign exchange. Furthermore, although the legal tender has undergone the recent exchange rate adjustment, it will still enjoy the trust of the people because it can be freely exchanged at any time.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Chongqing, 8th) According to financiers here, government officials and representatives from Hong Kong are currently taking advantage of the bank holiday to conduct in-depth research on the decline in the price of legal tender. Lin Qiu, an American advisor to the Bank of China who has just arrived here from Kunming, and Yang Ge, an advisor to the Central Bank, have also been invited to participate in the meeting. According to various observations, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with China's monetary institutions, so the current devaluation of legal tender is mostly due to the Japanese arbitrage of foreign exchange. Some suggest that China's current unfavorable foreign trade may also be one of the reasons, but all believe that China's Equalization Fund will definitely not be exhausted.</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th) Today, the stock market prices here rose sharply due to the news of the decline in the price of Chinese legal tender. The average increase in various stocks was 23 pounds.</p>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) In the past two days, the foreign exchange market in this city has tightened due to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange to the black market, causing gold prices to suddenly change dramatically. According to financial sources yesterday, the reporter learned that this phenomenon is expected to open up a new situation. From the perspective of national wealth, Shanghai's foreign exchange consumption has been increasing monthly recently, and even based on customs trade, an import surplus has been formed, increasing month by month. However, this point is not the main reason for the foreign exchange tightening. The focus of this decision is probably that the Japanese have recently been eagerly seeking to absorb legal tender in order to arbitrage foreign exchange, without redeploying it, which would be a loss to China's economy. This decision to restrict foreign exchange in the black market is an effective way to prevent arbitrage. As for the Central Bank's official exchange rate, it remains unchanged. According to general rumors, the government will announce new measures. According to news from the local Central Bank yesterday, no orders have been received yet. Financial figures believe that the Central Bank's official exchange rate should not change. If the rumor that the Chinese government is preparing to announce new measures is true, then its focus will be on the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Fund Committee.</p>
<p>Equalization Committee Stabilizes Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The Chinese government established a £10 million loan with four banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, to establish the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. Hong Kong was selected as the location for the Fund's equalization operations. The Committee's mission is to find ways to stabilize the difference between the British pound and the legal tender exchange rate at any time. Since its implementation, China's foreign exchange has become more stable, and it has also prevented speculators from manipulating it. When speculators sell, the government buys; when speculators buy, the government sells, so that speculators lose their power to manipulate. This task cannot be undertaken by the government and must be entrusted to the banks. As a result, the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market has also become more stable.</p>
<p>Preventing Japanese Speculation</p>
<p>Since the implementation of foreign exchange controls, the Central Bank has been designated to handle legal foreign exchange applications for various industries and individuals, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have been designated to handle foreign exchange settlements for the export of local goods. Now, in view of the fact that the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market is not unique to China; all countries in the world have it. However, the situation in China's black market is special and relatively difficult to crack down on. Since the issuance of "Huaxing" banknotes, they have massively purchased Chinese legal tender in an attempt to arbitrage foreign exchange. At the same time, the import surplus at the port of Shanghai has increased, resulting in a huge leakage of foreign exchange. The government is unable to eliminate the import surplus because its authority does not extend that far, so it has to find other ways to deal with it and prevent the Japanese from arbitrage.</p>
<p>Restricting Black Market Foreign Exchange Supply: HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and other banks received a telegram from Hong Kong on the morning of the 7th, suddenly restricting the supply of foreign exchange to the black market, causing general speculators to scramble to buy, creating an unprecedented tightening of foreign exchange in the black market. The foreign goods market and all transactions were chaotic, and the prices of domestic goods such as yarn rose sharply. Allowing the cash market to skyrocket without end. At the same time, rumors were rife in the financial market and involved the currency system, but these rumors are all unreliable. The government has the greatest determination to maintain the currency system, and it has been quite effective since its implementation. The foreign banks' restriction on the supply of foreign exchange is completely unrelated to the overall currency system policy.</p>
<p>Legitimate Needs Still Supplied</p>
<p>After HSBC and other banks restricted the supply of foreign exchange to the black market, it is said that new regulations will be introduced to ensure that legitimate merchants who cannot apply to the Central Bank for legal foreign exchange and turn to foreign banks to purchase foreign exchange will still be supplied without restrictions, provided that they submit order forms to prove that the foreign exchange is used for legitimate purposes. At the same time, it is said that British banks will only supply foreign exchange for British orders, making it impossible for foreign exchange speculators to engage in foreign exchange transactions again. It is also said that American banks such as Citibank are taking the same actions as British banks, so the Japanese will no longer be able to use their tricks to arbitrage foreign exchange in the future. The large-scale dumping of Japanese goods into China will inevitably be greatly hit.</p>
<p>Legal Applications Processed as Usual</p>
<p>The reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired at the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday and learned that the Central Bank continues to process legal foreign exchange applications for legitimate merchants in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry, and has not stopped accepting them or changed the regulations. Applications are still made on Mondays, approvals are still made on Fridays, and the legal price is still one shilling and two and a half pence. Applications for foreign exchange for imported goods shipped after January 1st of this year will not be supplied with legal foreign exchange unless specifically approved by the government. Applications for imported goods must be accompanied by proof of actual shipment of the goods. Private applications for foreign exchange are still processed monthly as before, and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee in Hong Kong also continues to process them as usual.</p>
<p>Shanghai Market to Stabilize</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange black market exchange rate tightened unprecedentedly from the 7th. On the 8th, the British HSBC posted the first exchange rate at 7 pence for the British pound and 13 yuan 625 for the US dollar. The second exchange rate was 6 pence 75 for the British pound and 13 yuan 125 for the US dollar. The third exchange rate was 6 and a half pence for the British pound and 12 yuan 625 for the US dollar. According to the reporter from the New Voice News Agency, after inquiring from the financial community and various industries, the tightening of foreign exchange and the soaring prices of foreign goods are temporary in nature and are expected to stabilize soon. This chaotic situation is actually caused by general rumormongers deliberately spreading rumors. The skyrocketing gold prices are also caused by speculation.</p>
<p>Black Market Tightening: Committee Investigates</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee held a meeting in Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 7th to discuss the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market. In addition to the attendance of committee members such as Rogers, Xi Demao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, also arrived in Hong Kong to attend the meeting and conduct research. The rumor that the Equalization Fund's £10 million has been exhausted has been denied, and it has been said that China's Equalization Fund is extremely abundant and can maintain the current foreign exchange capacity. It is hoped that there will be no self-alarm or worry. The tightening of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market is temporary in nature. According to the observation of a certain leader in the banking community, the tightening of black market foreign exchange is beneficial to domestic industries and has no harm; it can reduce import surpluses and promote exports.</p>
<p>Central Bank's Listing Unchanged</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Shanghai branch announced yesterday that the foreign exchange listing prices are: British pound, one shilling and two and a half pence; US dollar, thirty US dollars; Japanese yen, one hundred and three yuan; French franc, one thousand and eighty French francs; German mark, seventy-five marks; Hong Kong dollar, ninety-five Hong Kong dollars; silver balance tax, 4.50%; customs gold, two yuan, three corners, nine and four cents; bullion standard, one thousand two hundred and six yuan, two corners. The above prices are the same as before and have not changed, which proves that the Chinese government's commitment to maintaining legal foreign exchange remains the same and has not changed. The rumors circulating in the market are not credible.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Reports Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reported that the Sino-British Equalization Fund Committee again refused to sell any foreign exchange in Shanghai this morning (8th), causing the legal tender to lose support again. Its foreign exchange rate continued to fall. Around noon, the British pound shrank to 6.5 pence, equal to 35.5 yuan of legal tender per pound of British gold. The US dollar rose to 12.125 yuan, equal to a little over 8 yuan of legal tender per US dollar. Merchants, speculators, and the general public purchased less foreign exchange this morning, because there was a large decrease in those selling foreign exchange. However, the number of those wanting to purchase foreign exchange on the market increased greatly compared to yesterday (7th). A ten-ounce gold bar reached a new high on the grey market this morning, with a rate of 2,440 yuan, opening at 2,245 yuan. After reaching this record high, it closed at 2,335 yuan. Also, the Japanese yen opened quite strong this morning, calculated at 1 yuan and 4 fen, which is 4 fen higher than the legal tender, the first decision in many weeks. However, it fell back to 9 jiao 8 fen at noon. This afternoon, exchange shops on Sichuan Road sold Japanese yen at 9 jiao 9 fen, which is 6 fen lower than this morning's exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Pound Drops Sharply; Metal Prices Rise; Costs Increase by 20-30%; All Goods Expected to Increase in Price Uniformly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Metal Industry Association recently learned that due to the sharp drop in the pound, the settlement costs for various metal goods ordered by its members from European and American manufacturers have increased by 20-30%. It is learned that the association has decided to hold a special members' meeting at its headquarters at 4:00 PM on the 10th of this month (Saturday) to discuss appropriate measures. It is said that the meeting will discuss unifying market prices and uniformly increasing prices for all items to maintain capital. A notice has been issued, hoping that all members will attend the meeting on time to discuss.</p>
<h3>Restricting Black Market Foreign Exchange Supply; Import Surplus Expected to Decrease Sharply; This Year's Import Surplus Amount Sets Post-War Record; Restricting Foreign Exchange Most Beneficial to Domestic Goods Industry</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the only major commercial port in the Far East and holds the leading position in the national customs. Its import and export goods are the most of all customs areas. At the beginning of the war, the center of trade shifted inland, resulting in a sudden decline in customs trade. Since the summer of last year, it has gradually recovered. In April of this year, the total value of import and export trade was 88,770,764 yuan, setting a new post-war record. However, the import surplus figures</p>
<p>Have Increased Unabated</p>
<p>For example, the total import surplus for the whole of last year was only 51,857,000 yuan, while in January of this year it was 9,356,413 yuan, in February it was 5,129,304 yuan, in March it was 33,092,748 yuan, and in April it was 24,737,258 yuan. From January to April, it totaled 72,316,000 yuan, which is</p>
<p>More than the Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>Of 22,800,5,000 yuan, an increase of 54,511,000 yuan. In order to reduce foreign exchange leakage, the National Government has repeatedly tried to eliminate the import surplus at the Shanghai customs, but because the Shanghai customs is located in the occupied area, its authority does not extend that far. It is said that HSBC's</p>
<p>Restriction on Supply</p>
<p>Of foreign exchange in the black market is also a strategy to eliminate the import surplus at the Shanghai customs. Therefore, the import surplus figures for the Shanghai customs in the future may gradually decrease sharply, and it can also promote the development of domestic goods industry and benefit the entire future of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Affect Rice Prices; All Types of Rice Increase by Four or Five Jiao; Imported Rice May Be Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>Since the sudden and drastic changes in foreign exchange rates, the prices of various commodities have soared. Shanghai rice market prices rose across the board yesterday morning. The highest quality white rice had already returned to the 17 yuan level, but unexpectedly rose again to 17 yuan and 5 jiao. The number one grade Ke Xian and Du Jing rice also successively rose by four or five jiao. Overseas imported rice is priced far from the price in Shanghai due to foreign exchange issues, so it will not be easy to sell after it arrives. Currently, the supply of rice from various producing areas along the Yangtze River in the country is quite smooth, and the market has sufficient stock. Although it has suddenly been affected by foreign exchange and suddenly rebounded, it is a temporary issue and should fall soon.</p>
<h3>Fan Gencai Promoted by Order; His Unit Reorganized into the First Detachment; Training and Organization Further Refined</h3>
<p>The various units under Fan Gencai, the Third Battalion of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army, have been quite active in the Punan area due to their strict organization and effective training. They have inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army many times and have been victorious in every battle. Therefore, the local people call them the You Ji Iron Army. Furthermore, there are many capable young and progressive cadres within the unit, which enables local people's livelihood facilities, such as the development of education, agriculture, and industry, to actively cooperate with wartime needs. Recently, the National Government took the opportunity to reorganize the guerrilla forces and promoted Fan's unit, recognizing it as a powerful force in the anti-Japanese construction process, to the First Detachment of the Eighth Detachment of the First Column of the Loyal National Salvation Army of the Songhu Headquarters, appointing Fan Gencai as the commander of the detachment and Zhou Mingfa as the deputy commander of the detachment. As such, Fan's unit has become even more powerful. Since receiving the appointment, Fan has further refined the training of the units under his command, strengthened the organization, and actively implemented military-civilian cooperation in the civilian sphere.</p>

<h3>Dingle's Tragic Death; Britain Has Lodged Written Protest; Dingle's Abdomen Stabbed Deeply on Both Sides; Japanese Side Says Dingle Attacked, Contacting Bayonet; Lundin, Another Englishman, Dies From Shock</h3>
<p>*Continental News* reports that British Consul-General Phillips lodged an oral protest with the Japanese authorities here yesterday regarding Dingle's stabbing death by a Japanese sailor. The British Standing Authority will submit a written protest to the Japanese side today (8th). This statement was confirmed last night by an official from the British Consulate.</p>
<p>Another Employee Dies Suddenly</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that Lundin, a British employee of the Lundin Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, died last night (7th), one day after Dingle, another British employee of the mill, was stabbed to death. Lundin showed no signs of stabbing or injury, and the cause of his death remains a mystery. An autopsy will be performed by Dr. Anderson this afternoon (8th), and then the British Coroner will decide whether to hold an inquest. Lundin was found sitting at a table in the Lundin Cotton Mill last night by other British employees, suddenly collapsing and remaining motionless. He was carried by speedboat across the river to Shanghai in haste, arriving at the Hong-en Hospital shortly after 11:30 PM. Doctors examined him and said that he had died. It is believed that Lundin had been dead for more than half an hour when he arrived at the hospital. Although it is not possible to determine how Lundin died based on the symptoms, it is generally believed that he was shocked by Dingle's fatal injuries during the conflict, coupled with the humid and hot weather, which led to heart failure. Lundin, aged 35, had been with Lundin Cotton Mill for six years.</p>
<p>Dingle's Abdomen Stabbed Deeply</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that Dingle, 41, a British foreman at the Lundin Cotton Mill in Lujiazui, Pudong, was stabbed and seriously injured by a bayonet in a conflict with Japanese sailors in the mill on Saturday morning, and died of his injuries at the Gongji Hospital at 5:30 AM yesterday (7th). The body was placed in the Universal Funeral Home. An autopsy was performed yesterday afternoon and found that Dingle's abdomen had been stabbed deeply on both sides, and his body was covered with scars.</p>
<p>Too Late to Transport Him to Shanghai for Treatment</p>
<p>An official from the British Consulate claimed yesterday afternoon that Miura's protest was currently under investigation. According to preliminary investigations, the Japanese soldiers were slightly provoked, but appeared to have used unnecessary brutality. Dingle was stabbed and seriously injured, but the Japanese naval surgeon treating Dingle said as late as 7:00 PM that Dingle's condition did not cause concern and was improving. At 10:00 PM, news was received that Dingle's condition had worsened, and he was rushed from Pudong to Shanghai and admitted to the Gongji Hospital for surgery, but it was too late.</p>
<p>The Entire Incident is Being Investigated</p>
<p>Dingle was stabbed during the conflict in the mill and showed no signs of head injury, so the Japanese claim that he was hit on the head with a rifle butt seems untrue. However, Dingle had a wound on his right arm, as if he had been knocked to the ground and then stabbed with a bayonet. On Tuesday afternoon, the British Vice-Consul wanted to meet the injured person and asked to have the injured person treated by a foreign doctor, but was refused by the Japanese side. Dingle may have misunderstood the Japanese soldiers' intention to enter the mill, but the Japanese side used unnecessary violence. The entire incident is currently being investigated by the British authorities.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Claimed Dingle Lunged at the Rifle</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, Dingle fired one shot, but not at the Japanese officer, but into the ground. Although he threatened the Japanese officer, it may have been due to nervousness. The Japanese side declared at a press conference yesterday that Dingle threatened the Japanese officer with a gun, and after his pistol was knocked down, he lunged at a sailor. Several sailors were standing around him with bayonets. "It may be that Dingle touched the bayonet when he lunged." When asked how many times Dingle had touched the bayonet, the spokesperson replied that he was injured in five or six places, including being hit by a rifle butt.</p>
<p>Could He Walk With His Injuries?</p>
<p>When asked why the Japanese side did not allow the British Consulate to transfer Dingle at 4:00 PM, the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy replied that the Japanese side had to conduct an investigation. Dingle walked to the Japanese military headquarters after being injured. Dingle firmly refused treatment from a Japanese doctor. When asked if he could walk with five or six such injuries, the spokesperson replied that he could not discuss this issue in his position.</p>
<p>The Issue of Limiting Legal Jurisdiction</p>
<p>When asked if the jurisdictional rights of any foreigner resisting the Japanese army would be respected, the spokesperson replied that the jurisdictional rights would be respected in principle, but if they took actions in the occupied area that endangered the safety of the Japanese army, their jurisdictional rights would be limited. This is not a question of applying the law, but a question of direct action necessary to maintain the safety of the Japanese army, he said. Dingle first came to Shanghai in 1919. In August of that year, he joined the police force and resigned in 1930 to go to the United States. He returned to Shanghai in the same year, joined the Lundin Company, lived alone in Pudong, and was quite well-known in the sports community.</p>
<p>The Old Factory Forced to Suspend Work Again</p>
<p>The Lundin Cotton Mill originally had two factories, a new one and an old one, located in Lujiazui, Pudong, and Bailianjing, respectively. After a labor strike occurred in the new factory, the workers in the old factory continued to work as usual without being affected. Later, due to the threats and instigation of the puppet regime, they were forced to join the strike. However, the workers understood the righteousness and were unwilling to be exploited for meaningless sacrifices, so they resumed work the morning before. Unexpectedly, the pseudo "Workers' Alliance" came out again to sabotage, and dozens of pseudo-police officers went to the front of the factory and fired guns to demonstrate, forcing the workers to leave the factory. As a result, one male worker was shot and critically injured. The workers under the oppression of iron heels will be left with nothing.</p>
<h3>Preposterous Japanese Rhetoric</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, 8th) Navy Spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa, during a press conference today, stated that the Lun Chang incident in Pudong represented an expression of anti-Japanese sentiment among the British community in Shanghai. The incident itself was minor, and in his opinion, the British should maintain a calm attitude, as the cumulative effect of such minor incidents could lead to significant developments in the current situation. He expressed regret over Ting-ge-le's fatal injury. However, the Japanese Marines were maintaining peace and order within the Lun Chang factory area after establishing a complete understanding with the British authorities. Yet, Mr. Ting brandished a loaded pistol at the commander of the Marines and other senior officers, and even fired a shot at them. This incomprehensible and aggressive behavior was deeply regrettable. No Japanese sailor, he said, could fail to view this behavior as an insult to the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 8th) Today, all the newspapers here prominently featured the news of the death of Ting-ge-le, a member of the Lun Chang company, due to injuries. However, no commentary has been published yet. Government circles consider this a particularly unfortunate case, but will take action only after receiving a report from the Shanghai Consul.</p>
<p>Japanese Convene Meeting of Factory Representatives</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that Major Noji, commander of the Japanese Marines in Pudong, summoned representatives of foreign factories in Pudong to a meeting at his headquarters at 1:00 PM. The subject of the discussion was not disclosed, but it is generally believed that the labor situation will be thoroughly discussed.</p>
<p>Puppet Allied Association Instigates Anti-British Actions</p>
<p>Regarding the strike at the Lun Chang factory in Pudong, the "Workers' Allied Association" formed by the puppet regime is now creating various new actions one after another to escalate the situation. Yesterday afternoon, they held a third organized anti-British mass parade. Activists were dispatched in advance to entice workers from house to house, claiming they would receive a relief payment. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, male and female workers gradually gathered in front of the puppet "District Office" on Dongchang Road, forcing workers to re-register. Each person was given a bread ticket worth one dime as lunch money, as well as a so-called relief payment voucher. Fearing that workers would scatter and not participate in the parade, the relief payment was delayed until 2:00 PM, when the workers were ordered to gather again in front of the "District Office." Each person was given an anti-British paper flag. Then, more than a hundred activists from the so-called "Chinese Workers' Allied Association" and a "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Alliance," etc., led the way, heading east and parading along Pudong Avenue, Yangjiazhai, Lanbo Ferry, Yangjiadu, and other places for two hours. They then returned to the front of the "District Office" and gathered to collect the payment upon presentation of the voucher. Each person received only one yuan, although the workers initially thought they would receive five yuan. As a result, they were greatly disappointed. Moreover, due to the large number of people, the order was chaotic. The puppet "police" and puppet "detectives" who were suppressing the scene indiscriminately beat people with whips and clubs, treating the workers no differently than cattle and horses. The beaten workers complained incessantly. Furthermore, it was learned that on the morning of the 6th, at the Xinjiazui factory, a member of the "Allied Association" used a wooden stick to beat workers who were going to work. In addition to one Englishman being stabbed, more than thirty workers were arrested by the Noji unit of the Japanese army, detained for two days and nights, and released yesterday with conditions attached. They were forced to mutually guarantee each other, with two people guaranteeing one person, ensuring that no worker would return to work at the factory before the labor unrest was resolved.</p>
<h3>U.S. Fleet Commander Departs Shanghai for North China – This is the Final Inspection of North China – U.S. River Gunboat to Depart Today for Patrol</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, departed from Shanghai at 1:00 PM today (the 8th) aboard the flagship USS *Augusta* for Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and Yantai. This is Admiral Yarnell's final inspection trip to North China. His personal yacht, the USS *Isabel*, carrying Mrs. Yarnell, Mrs. MacDonald, wife of the Asiatic Fleet Chief of Staff Colonel MacDonald, and other naval officers' wives, also set sail for North China this morning at 8:00 AM. The two ships will</p>
<p>meet at sea</p>
<p>and sail together to Qinhuangdao. According to the current schedule, the *Augusta* will return to Shanghai in the fall. However, when the new commander, Rear Admiral Heard, assumes command of the Asiatic Fleet around August 1st, the *Augusta* may</p>
<p>alter its schedule. In addition, the U.S. river gunboat USS *Wake*, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at around 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 9th), sailing up the Yangtze River to Nanjing and Wuhu. The U.S. minesweeper USS *Lark*, coming from Manila, will</p>
<p>arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>The U.S. destroyer USS *Black Hawk*, which came from Manila via various ports in South China, is scheduled to arrive here next Sunday. The USS *Pittsburg* is scheduled to leave Shanghai for North China on Saturday, including the four ships of</p>
<h3>Coastal Vessels Sailing from Qidong Change Place Names for Customs Clearance – Most Vessels at Other Ports Have Ceased Operations – Customs Authorities Face Difficult Circumstances</h3>
<p>A notice from the Japanese Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs stated that from June 1st, vessels sailing to nine ports within the Jianghai region must first obtain permission from the Japanese Navy and Army, be issued a permit, and be approved by an additional Customs Commissioner before customs clearance is permitted. Last Saturday (the 3rd), the British Taikoo Company's *Wantung* was refused customs clearance because it did not have the above procedures, resulting in the decision to suspend operations. On Monday of this week (the 5th), Haimen and Qidong were changed to Qinglonggang and Erhegang, respectively, before customs clearance and navigation were permitted. This information has been recorded in previous reports.</p>
<p>Difficult Situation to Cope With</p>
<p>However, yesterday's newspaper reported that vessels sailing to inland ports were cleared as usual, and that the Customs authorities were determined to abide by customs regulations and maintain administration, despite the Japanese Customs Commissioner's obstruction of vessel clearance. It is now learned that the Customs authorities do indeed intend to maintain this position, but it is difficult to cope in this special situation. The incident of the *Wantung*'s obstructed clearance last Saturday already demonstrates the Customs authorities' difficulties.</p>
<p>Change Place Names to Avoid Disputes</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the notice from the Japanese commissioner stated that vessels sailing to the nine ports of Haimen, Qidong, Funing, Quanzhou, Xinghua, etc., must obtain a permit from the Japanese Navy authorities and have the permit and customs declaration form signed by the Japanese Customs Commissioner before customs clearance and departure, foreign shipping companies had not complied with this as of yesterday. This reporter also knows that the shipping companies have indeed not complied. However, the reason they have not complied is that they have not dispatched ships to the prohibited ports, so there is no need to comply.</p>
<p>Proof of Niuzhuang's Route Change</p>
<p>As for the Taikoo Company's *Niuzhuang*, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Xiamen on the 6th, also calling at Xinghua and Quanzhou, it was later changed to sail to Beiyang. Yesterday afternoon, it loaded more than 10,000 bags of flour, 200 pieces of cotton yarn, and other goods to Qingdao and Tianjin. Although changing shipping routes is common for shipping companies and not unusual, the *Niuzhuang*'s dispatch to the prohibited Xinghua and Quanzhou areas occurred after the *Wantung*'s clearance was blocked, so the *Niuzhuang*'s change of route is different from usual and may be somewhat related. Furthermore, it is said that although coastal vessels sailing to the north no longer use the names Haimen and Qidong, customs clearance has not been signed by the Japanese Customs Commissioner. It can be seen that the purpose of the prohibition is in the names. Since each vessel does not use the names Haimen and Qidong, they are naturally not obstructed.</p>
<p>Export Manifest Temporarily Altered</p>
<p>This reporter happened to be at a British shipping company yesterday afternoon. The company's ship sailing to the north also happened to be in Shanghai. The ship's compradore went to the company to tell a senior employee, "Do not write Haimen and Qidong (in English) on the export manifest to avoid disputes." The senior employee immediately took the export manifest, still written with Haimen and Qidong, and crossed it out with a pen, changing it to the English name of Sanhe Port. This reporter witnessed it firsthand. The Customs and shipping merchants are indeed implementing the notice of the Japanese Customs Commissioner. Outsiders may find it difficult to understand, but related shipping merchants must be aware of it. The Asiatic Fleet Destroyer Division 15, consisting of four destroyers, sailed directly from Manila to North China, without stopping in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wu Nianzhong Accepts Puppet Position, Fills the Puppet "Mayor of Hangzhou" – Shang Rongzhou Fills Puppet Police Chief</h3>
<p>After the assassination of He Zan, the puppet mayor of Hangzhou, his vacant puppet position was temporarily filled by the puppet Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs. It is now learned that the puppet regime has appointed Wu Nianzhong to fill the puppet mayor of Hangzhou. In addition, Shang Rongzhou has been appointed to fill the puppet chief of police of the puppet Zhejiang Provincial Capital Police Bureau.</p>
<h3>British Community Celebrates the King's Birthday Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the British community and their international friends celebrated the birthday of King George VI of England today (the 8th). The East Surrey Regiment of the British Army performed at the Great Western Road Barracks. Major General Simmons, the new commander of the British forces stationed in Shanghai, led the crowd in three cheers. Another British army unit then drilled at the racetrack. The British Consul-General hosted a luncheon at the Zero Club in conjunction with the Royal Air Force to entertain the British community. The British Ambassador and others will also host a banquet tonight to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Organize Traffic Safety Campaigns Separately – Public Concession Produces Film – French Concession Creates Posters for Propaganda</h3>
<p>The *Continental Daily* reported that the Public Concession Police Department is preparing to launch "Accident-Free Week" starting June 18th. The French Concession Police Department also announced yesterday (the 7th) the start of the French Concession's Safety First campaign. The Shanghai Municipal Council's film crew filmed at six traffic-congested locations in the Public Concession yesterday. For example, at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, they filmed</p>
<p>traffic signals</p>
<p>and the correct and incorrect actions of pedestrians and vehicles. It will be accompanied by an audio explanation. When "Accident-Free Week" begins on June 18th, it will be screened in cinemas throughout the Public Concession to explain to the dense population the dangers of violating traffic rules. The authorities hope that no major accidents will occur during that week.

<h3>Covetous Concubine's Insatiable Desires – Accuses Husband of Seduction and Abandonment – Xu Qizhong's Troubles Multiply – The Napping of Concubines Should Be an Object Lesson</h3>
<p>Xu Guannan, a wealthy merchant from Huzhou residing in Shanghai, although having many wives and concubines, has only one son. The son, named Qizhong, is now twenty-seven years old. Spoiled by his parents since childhood, he grew up to be unproductive, only knowing how to pursue women and squander money. When the Xu family was at the northern end of Old Garbage Bridge (i.e., North Zhejiang Road), it was Qizhong's golden age. At that time, he was just past his coming-of-age ceremony and already possessed one wife and one concubine. Later, his small star increased from one to three. Alas, such happiness did not last long. Chen Hailun, his beloved concubine, suddenly left of her own accord. Not long after, he was forced to declare bankruptcy to the court to avoid debts. His creditors were all song and dance houses, brothels, cosmetic shops, clothing stores, and restaurants. His only assets were radios, phonographs, and other toys. Such a bankruptcy case was unprecedented and was touted as an innovation at the time. After the bankruptcy, his tracks temporarily disappeared from the places in Shanghai where money was spent. Qizhong had taken his entire family, including his wife Liu, and concubines Ke Zhizhen and Sheng Meiying, to Suzhou to live. It was not until the outbreak of the August 13th Incident two years ago that the family once again sought refuge in Shanghai. He rented a place for his wife and concubine Ke at No. 176, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road, and rented an apartment for the concubine Sheng. This concubine, one year younger than Qizhong, met him in the winter of 1931 and began living with him the following year, becoming his first small star. However, there were two special provisions in the cohabitation contract: 1. Both parties may terminate the cohabitation at any time. 2. The active party terminating the cohabitation shall compensate the other party for a loss of 10,000 national currency. But since living together, the two have been very fond of each other. Qizhong would fulfill any wish of Meiying's. Over the years, he has provided her with countless clothes and ornaments, including hundreds of revetments and wallets. He even had a tooth specially set with diamonds, costing as much as 600 or 700 gold. All these decorations were unique to her, and their love could be seen. It was unexpected that they could not be together forever. On April 6th, she quietly left. Although Qizhong still longed for her, he specially wrote five seven-character poems, "Swallow's Lament," to her. Meiying also followed suit and composed two poems in harmony. Then, she hired Cheng Zhengping as her lawyer and sued Qizhong in the First Special District Court for breach of contract. The court hearing has already been opened for mediation, but it was not established. Therefore, in addition to formally reporting, the concubine, represented by Lawyer Cheng, filed a criminal private prosecution, alleging that she was seduced by Qizhong into adultery at the age of eighteen. She then cohabited with him and signed a contract stating that she would receive a monthly allowance of 200 yuan. Recently, she discovered that the defendant already had a wife and was also cohabiting with two women, Ke and Chen, spending lavishly, secretly pledging the plaintiff's ornaments and property, and maliciously abandoning her. She also filed a civil lawsuit to recover a loss of 10,000 yuan, as well as 30,000 yuan in alimony, and 200 yuan per month for living expenses during the separation period from June 1, 1936, until the date of the final judgment. The court costs would be borne by the defendant. Yesterday afternoon, she was summoned by Judge Shen Tuina. The plaintiff was ill and did not appear. Lawyer Cheng requested a postponement. The defendant, Xu Qizhong, surrendered himself and denied abandoning the plaintiff. After discussion, the court adjourned the hearing for a retrial.</p>
<h3>Slandering Reputation – Dancer Fined</h3>
<p>Lin Aina, a dancer at the Dahua Dance Hall, lived at No. 12, Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road. Her mother, Gu Zhao, previously sent a letter to Chuan Fanrong, the owner of the Ronghua Hall Bookstore on Jixiang Street, French Concession, claiming that her daughter Lin Aina's chastity had been rumored to be ruined and demanding compensation for a loss of more than 10,000 gold. Chuan ignored it because he thought Zhao's mother was making false accusations and extorting money. Later, the Zhao mother and daughter spread defamatory words, intending to damage Chuan's reputation. Therefore, Chuan hired lawyer Wu Chuliang to file a complaint with the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing the Zhao mother and daughter of jointly maliciously defaming him. The case has been investigated by Judge Fang Qinghuan. Yesterday, in the Eighth Criminal Court, the following judgment was announced: Gu Zhao and Lin Aina jointly spread defamatory words and were each fined 100 yuan. If they were to be replaced by hard labor, they could be offset by two yuan per day. In the attached civil lawsuit, the defendants Lin Aina, etc., should publish the full text of the judgment in the *Shen Bao* and on the opposite advertisement for three days.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide After Lover is Taken Away</h3>
<p>Su Zuyu, a young man from Ningbo, nineteen years old, lived with his parents and siblings at No. 627, Malang Road, French Concession. He worked in the machine room of the Rongjin Grand Theater on Kangti Road, managing the movie projector. He had been in love with a Miss Shi, a female worker in a nearby sock factory, for a long time. Unexpectedly, the girl recently became engaged to another man on the orders of her parents and through the words of a matchmaker on the fifth of this month. Although Su knew about it, he was unable to salvage the situation. Only on the evening of the fifth did Su arrange for the girl to meet him at the Dasing Company amusement park. The two parted on bad terms. After Su returned home, he felt his lover had been taken away and committed suicide by drinking poison. After taking the poison, he was immediately discovered by his family and sent to Guangci Hospital. However, the poison had penetrated too deeply, and treatment was ineffective. He died at 11:00 PM that night. The hospital reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday, Prosecutor Ren from the Second Special Court visited the mortuary and confirmed the cause of death. His father, Su Tang, signed for the body and took it for burial.</p>
<h3>Catholic Couple Cannot Divorce – Shen Xiangmeixiang Accuses Husband of Having a Hidden Illness – Sues for Divorce and Support – Defendant's Lawyer Asks for the Suit to be Dismissed</h3>
<p>Shen Xiangmeixiang, a young woman from Ningbo, now residing at No. 23, Ningbo Road, British Concession, is twenty-five years old and has received a considerable education. On April 27, 1935, she married Shen Jiaju (twenty-eight years old this year), a local from No. 45, Taoyuan Village, Route Louchun, French Concession, with Yue Fengxiang and Zhu Luyi as matchmakers. Since they have been married and living together for four years, Shen has suffered from a hidden illness and has never consummated the marriage. Shen Xiangmeixiang, feeling unfortunate to have married such a husband and with no hope of happiness, hired lawyers Wu Linkun, Wu Shaolin, and Su Baichuan to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against her husband, Shen Jiaju, for malicious abandonment and intolerable cohabitation. She requested a divorce, the return of a dowry fee of 12,000 yuan, the recovery of 30,000 yuan in alimony, and 200 yuan per month for living expenses during the separation period from June 1, 1936, until the final judgment. The litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned both parties for a hearing in the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. First, the plaintiff, Shen Xiangmeixiang, stated that she had been subjected to unwarranted abuse by her husband and mother-in-law, treating her no differently than a maid. Therefore, the plaintiff had no choice but to return to her mother's home and has been there for two years. The defendant has not taken any care of her daily expenses. She requested that a divorce be granted and that dowry fees, etc., be recovered. The defendant, represented by lawyer Tang Hao, requested that the plaintiff's suit be dismissed, and that the litigation costs be borne by the plaintiff. He claimed that the defendant's family were Catholics and that according to Catholic regulations, couples could not divorce. If a divorce were to occur, the husband would never be allowed to remarry. Moreover, the defendant is the only son and spent more than 10,000 yuan to marry the plaintiff, hoping to continue the family line. How could they divorce without cause? In the defendant's family, besides the plaintiff, there are only three people: the defendant, his elderly mother, and a younger sister. The family situation is very happy. It is actually the plaintiff who is seeking a divorce without cause, and the suit should be dismissed. After reviewing the words, the court ordered a change of date to the 23rd to summon the defendant and his mother to court for a retrial.</p>
<h3>50,000 Yuan Marriage Agreement Case Reaches Settlement – Dancer Awarded 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zheng Zuoyi, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 22, Rue de Bel Air, French Concession (whose father is quite famous in the pawnshop business), is very wealthy. Having just reached adulthood, he frequents dance halls, acting lavishly and posing as a wealthy young master. Three years ago, he met Zhang Xiuying, a dancer (whose stage name is Chen Jijun), and their relationship deepened over time. They began cohabiting. Miss Zhang also felt fortunate to have met the son of a wealthy family, a rare opportunity that she did not want to miss, so she diligently flattered him. In the heat of love, she coerced Zheng into signing a marriage agreement, setting the deadline for marriage as September 12 of the previous year. If Zheng failed to fulfill the agreement by the deadline, he would have to compensate the woman with 50,000 yuan for living expenses and sign a note as proof. However, Zheng was later obstructed by his parents, and the marriage ceremony was not held. The woman hired lawyer Ma Zhenzong to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court against Zheng for breach of contract. The initial trial ruled in favor of the woman. Zheng was dissatisfied and hired lawyer Sun Zuji to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. Several hearings have already been held. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was held. However, both parties did not appear. It is now learned that the case has been mediated by someone named Xie, and Zheng gave the woman 10,000 yuan as compensation for living expenses, bringing the matter to a close. A half-year-long scandal lawsuit has come to an end.</p>

<p>Rong Xihua, a meat vendor living at No. 36, Duyifang, Chengdu Road, has a meat stall at the Fuzhou Road vegetable market. Recently, due to drastic changes in the meat market, there was a time when there was no meat to sell. Rong bought pigs from Hongkou and supplied the market as usual, making considerable profits. This aroused the envy of some gangsters, who constantly demanded petty rules from Rong. When Rong refused, the gangsters thought of ways to retaliate. Rong had a long-term room at No. 22, Xinshanghai Hotel, Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, Rong's wife, Chen, borrowed her brother, Chen Xingwang, to go to Xinshanghai. Unexpectedly, the gangsters surrounded and beat him. Chen Xingwang's left leg was injured. At that time, the gangsters arranged for Rong to negotiate at the Yiyanlou teahouse, No. 591, Guangdong Road, at 7:00 PM on the seventh. Rong went as agreed. Unexpectedly, there were forty or fifty gangsters gathered in the teahouse, most of them holding iron rods and wooden sticks. At that time, the leader of the gang, named Xin Sai, demanded that Rong give him thirty yuan to settle the matter. Rong thought that if he agreed to their demands, he would be bothered endlessly in the future. So, on the pretext of going out to get money, he telephoned the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese detective Wang Yingjie, detectives Qiu Enjiu, and Zhang Bingchun, along with a Western detective, rushed to the scene. The gangsters surrounded the detectives with iron rods, etc., and swung their clubs, trying to beat them. Seeing the situation was not good, detective Wang drew his gun and fired a shot at the leg of Yu Changqing, a man from Beiping, who was rushing towards him. He fell to the ground. The gangsters scattered. Qiu detective arrested Cao Xingen, a man from Nanjing, and Yao Shangen, a man from Suzhou, at the scene, and seized three iron rods and one wooden stick.

After questioning by Judge Xiao Xifen, he ordered the two defendants Cao and Yao to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for one week.</p>

<h3>Brothers Are Both Intellectuals: Why the Impulsive Actions? Quarrel Leads to Violence; Two File Cases, Accusing Each Other of Assault</h3>
<p>Shen Wenbin, a local resident and former member of the Shanghai Nanshi Merchant Corps, sacrificed his life while defending the area during the war in the summer of the second year of the Republic [1913], killed by Liu Fubiao's troops. He left behind two sons: the elder, Shen Xiongqing, is forty years old this year. He was admitted to Tsinghua University on a government scholarship to study in the United States. After returning to China, he served as a professor at various universities. He is currently an instructor at the Shanghai Medical College of the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. The younger son, Shen Yuqing, is twenty-seven years old this year. He was born posthumously and currently works at He Feng Foreign Firm in Guangdong, also serving as a night school teacher.</p>
<p>Brothers Living Together</p>
<p>The mother, who is sixty-one years old this year, lives with her two sons at No. 2 Ya New Village, Avenue Albert, in the French Concession. Xiongqing is married, while Yuqing is still single. On the 2nd of this month at 1:00 PM, Shen Xiongqing and Shen Yuqing had a quarrel over inheritance, which escalated into physical violence. They both went to the French police station to report the incident, accusing each other of assault. The police chief ordered them to wait for further investigation. Shen Xiongqing requested a medical examination from Guangci Hospital, while Shen Yuqing submitted a statement to the Procuratorate of the Special District Second Court requesting a medical examination. The police station has concluded its investigation.</p>
<p>The Brothers Shen Summoned</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shen brothers were summoned to the Criminal Division Eight of the Special District Second Court, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, presented the case, accusing the Shen brothers of assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Code. According to Shen Xiongqing's testimony, after his father died, the family was very poor and he worked hard to pass the government-funded examination to study abroad. After returning to China and becoming a professor, he supported the family. His younger brother, Yuqing, was nurtured by him, from primary school to middle school to the first year of university. However, he did not seek to improve himself and often asked him and his mother for money to squander. On the 2nd at noon, when he</p>
<p>returned home for lunch,</p>
<p>he did not see his wife and said she was not doing her duties during the meal. His younger brother misunderstood him and came upstairs to hit him, causing his left eye to swell. Therefore, he reported the matter to the police station for investigation. He has also retained lawyer Shen Weihan for his defense and filed a civil suit to recover 12 yuan in medical expenses. Shen Yuqing testified that his father died for the public in the second year of the Republic [1913] and received compensation. His brother used this</p>
<p>to study and succeed. Now he secretly hides the family's antiques and often complains about me coming home for meals. On the 2nd at noon, when I came home for lunch, my brother rushed me out. I replied to him, the family has not been divided, and the mother is still here, how can you</p>
<p>chase me out?</p>
<p>This led to him hitting me first. I blocked him, which led to him injuring his left eye. I was also injured. I will ask the court to examine my injuries. My brother dragged me to the police station, so I am also accusing him of injury. Since then, he has locked my room and does not allow me to return home. I work at He Feng Foreign Firm and also teach at a night school. I do not loaf around, which can be</p>
<p>investigated. What my brother said is completely untrue. I ask for a fair trial and have retained lawyers Wang Heng and Gu for my defense. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered a postponement to the 15th to review the medical examination reports and ordered Shen Xiongqing to go to the French Concession for a medical examination before the next hearing. The court also urged both parties to reconcile and avoid hurting fraternal feelings. The defendants listened attentively.</p>

<h3>Encounter in French Park, Cohabitation with Widow; Dispute Between Wife and Concubine of Kang Sheng Photo Studio Owner; Concubine Beaten, Wife Fined</h3>
<p>Gu Yingquan, also known as Gu Fuhong, a local resident and owner of Kang Sheng Photo Studio at 595 Avenue Joffre, had a wife, Wang Qiuzhen, 31 years old, living at 1852 Haig Road, Xujiahui. Last year, Gu had an affair with Fang Juanjuan, a woman from Songjiang (the concubine of the late Cai Diaotu), 27 years old and a widow. They cohabited at No. 4, Rixin Lane, Dapu Bridge, Jin Shenfu Road. Gu's wife, Wang, found out and on the morning of the 29th of last month at 9:00 AM, gathered nearly 20 women and went to Fang Juanjuan's place, where they interrogated her and</p>
<p>grabbed and beat</p>
<p>Fang Juanjuan, causing her injuries. They then dispersed. Fang reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Gu's wife, Wang Qiuzhen, and sent her to the Special District Second Court. The hearing was postponed for further investigation. All of this was reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, Fang was examined by a forensic doctor and confirmed to be injured. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhu Chuzhe continued the hearing in Criminal Division Eight. The French authorities prosecuted Wang under the charge of assault. According to the plaintiff, Fang Juanjuan, she came to Shanghai to seek refuge after her husband passed away. Last year, she was playing in the French Park when she was encountered by the defendant's husband, who</p>
<p>seduced her into cohabitation.</p>
<p>On that day, the defendant brought many people and beat her, causing injuries. She requests an investigation and reserves the right to file a civil suit. The defendant, Wang Qiuzhen, testified that the plaintiff had an affair with her husband. In mid-December of last year, she went to catch them in the act and went to the police station. The plaintiff asked her to drop the charges and promised to end the affair, but they continued to live together. On that day, she went to her husband to ask for living expenses, which led to a quarrel with the plaintiff. She stumbled during her testimony. The court reviewed the testimony and sentenced Wang Qiuzhen to a fine of ten yuan for jointly causing bodily harm, with the option of serving a day of labor for each yuan. She must post bail during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: According to Mr. Cheng Tieyin of Jiji Company, the news item in your newspaper's news column on the 7th of this month regarding the Vienna Dance Hall case contains inaccuracies. The company is jointly organized by us and is completely unrelated to Mr. Shan Sheng, so he should not be involved in the case. Furthermore, the amount defrauded from our company totaled over 6,900 yuan, not 4,600 yuan. Although the defendants have been acquitted, the facts will eventually come to light. In addition to appealing for legal recourse, the report seems to be based on inaccurate rumors. We kindly request that you instruct your lawyer to issue a correction to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Lawyer Tang Ying, June 8th.</p>

<h3>Under the Attention of All Shanghai Residents: Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange and Commodity Markets - Stability of Mind is Paramount - Exercise Caution Against Profiteering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation was even more different from the previous day. The drastic changes in the financial market the day before were still unknown to the general public. Although the danger was great, they were unaware of it. After yesterday's newspaper disclosure, panic spread throughout Shanghai. There was talk of foreign exchange and worries about prices. In fact, if everyone could remain as unaware as the day before, they would be calm and composed. Moreover, the changes will certainly not disregard the interests of the public, so there is no need to worry unnecessarily. As for the foreign exchange fund, its situation is generally unknown to the public, and what is rumored may not be credible. A reduction may be a fact, but there is no need to say much about it. However, because of the reduction, it is felt that there is a need to change course in the foreign exchange market. "Lose in the east, gain in the west," it is still not losing the opportunity "to mend the fold after the sheep are lost."</p>
<p>The British exchange rate fell another point to 6.5 yesterday, only reaching 45% of the legal price. The US exchange rate was 12.625 yuan, only reaching a little over 42% of the legal exchange rate. What this reflects is, of course, a lack of supply, and what is being traded is the chips stored in the market. Therefore, before new inflows arrive, there is no hope for a turnaround in the exchange market. Observing the market sentiment, there are two trends. One is to wait and see and not want to express anything for the time being, such as large-scale exports of raw silk, etc. The other is to rush to raise prices, hoping to gain unexpected profits and make up for possible losses. The intentions of the stockholders are also divided into two types: some are still seeking to escape capital, while others are hoarding to enrich their wealth. The continued rise in the market price of gold by 164 yuan, the rise in British and American gold pounds by 3 yuan each, the rise in British banknotes by 2.5 yuan, the rise in American banknotes by 6.8 points, and the large volume of transactions in foreign shares of the Public Industries Association are all manifestations of this kind of psychology. However, if you think about it calmly, what would be the situation if the legal tender reached its ideal state? Then today's anxiety is simply self-inflicted trouble.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai market has been disrupted to the point of chaos, and everyone wants to know what the Chinese government's public attitude towards this incident should be. As of the time this reporter submitted the manuscript, this information had not yet been obtained, but it will be expressed soon. What we hope for is that, in addition to the government expressing its foreign exchange policy as soon as possible to reassure the people and avoid unnecessary losses, we also hope that the people of Shanghai, including those in the industrial and commercial sectors and general speculators, will not take advantage of the fire to loot and not allow the market to fall into chaos and even become irreparable. It is important to know that the exchange market will eventually stabilize, and the rise and fall of market prices will have their own paths to follow. Acting rashly, if unfortunately, it backfires, the disaster is self-inflicted and not worth pitying, but what about the safety of the entire market?</p>
<h3>HSBC's Foreign Exchange Quotation in Shanghai Changed Three Times, Further Tightening Foreign Exchange Situation - Foreign Firms Scramble to Purchase, Creating New Low Prices - Hong Kong Exchange Rate also Drops by a Huge 7 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's quoted price the day before unexpectedly made a third reduction during the Wednesday afternoon holiday. It is estimated that the British exchange rate was reduced by .25 compared to 10:50 am on the same day, and the US exchange rate was also reduced by half a yuan. Yesterday's quotation saw three more changes: a reduction was seen at 8:30 am, with the British exchange rate reduced by .5 and the US exchange rate by 1 yuan. Then at 10:00 am, the British exchange rate was reduced again by .25, and the US exchange rate was reduced by another 5 points. Later, at 10:20 am, the British exchange rate was reduced again by .25, and the US exchange rate was reduced by another 5 points. Other exchange rates also fell uniformly. It is estimated that the final British exchange rate was suspended at 6.5, and the US exchange rate was 12.625 yuan. Therefore, it created an unprecedented new low price since the introduction of quotations. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still in a state of extreme chaos. Major import firms were scrambling to buy without end. In addition, Hong Kong was celebrating the King's birthday, so there was no market. Therefore, foreign banks' willingness to sell was quite weak, and they were unwilling to let go unless the price was high, resulting in a very tight situation. It is estimated that the British gold once called tight to 6.25, and the US exchange rate also called soft to 12.25. Later, because HSBC, McCarly, and others rose up to maintain it, the people's hearts suddenly stabilized, and the foreign firms' buying spree slightly subsided, and then rebounded. As a result, the closing price of British gold was 6.75 and the US exchange rate was 13.125 yuan, a continued tightening of .75 for the British and a reduction of 1.5 yuan for the US compared to the previous British exchange rate. The Hong Kong exchange rate also dropped sharply by 7 yuan compared to the last price.</p>
<p>However, we have two points to consider here. After this change in the exchange market, it is inevitable that people's hearts will be turbulent. In addition, speculators are taking advantage of the opportunity to fuel the flames, and there is even the possibility of promoting market unrest. However, this is the state that should exist in the process of change, and after a period of time, wealth will still return to normal. Therefore, we should use a calm mind to look forward to the development of facts, and must not make unnecessary disturbances due to the temporary trend. That is what is called using one static action to control a hundred movements. After the exchange market restricted supply, hoarding and speculation have already begun. All those directly and indirectly related to foreign goods are actively raising prices. The impact on the general people's livelihood is huge. Those who use foreign exchange to calculate their profits for daily necessities will also have the idea of increasing the burden on the general public. Therefore, we hope that the government will have a clear expression to clarify the effect of this decision, and for essential imports, it should also promptly stipulate regulations to allow them to apply freely according to the legal exchange rate. If so, no matter how much the black market shrinks, what is the price of necessities? If so, the people's hearts will be at ease, and if the people's hearts are at ease, the market will be stable.</p>
<p>Extreme Disorder in the Exchange Market</p>
<p>In the early morning, the large and small contracts in London all dropped by .0625, the price of New York silver was stagnant, the price of London raw gold did not change, the exchange rate of British against American was slightly lower, and against Shanghai was still flat. Against France, it fell by 4 cents. The US against British did not move, against Shanghai it fell sharply by 1.47 yuan, and against France it dropped by .0625. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. It was heard that although HSBC Bank was on a Wednesday holiday the day before, due to the extreme tightness of foreign exchange, it broke the precedent and announced three decisions at 2:00 pm. The British exchange rate was reduced by .25, and the US was also listed half a yuan lower. Other exchange rates also fell uniformly. The opening spot selling price in the morning was 7.25 for the British exchange rate and 14.125 yuan for the US exchange rate, a tightening of .25 for the British and a softening of .5 yuan for the US compared to the previous close. After the opening, the market situation was quite chaotic. Major foreign firms were scrambling to buy. In addition, Hong Kong was closed due to the celebration of the King's birthday. Therefore, the banking sector in Shanghai was unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in a tight market situation. It is estimated that foreign firms' settlement of the Hollandsche Bank Unie spot US exchange rate was only 13.75 and .625. At 9:30, HSBC's quoted price was announced, and British gold dropped again by .5, and the US also softened by 1 yuan. Other exchange rates also fell again. The white silver equalization tax was announced to be slightly lower, estimated to be 4.50%. At that time, Qian Dui Ye bought in the Hua Yi spot US exchange rate for only 13.75. Then the foreign firm again settled with a certain bank for the spot US exchange rate at 13.625. Extending to 10:00, HSBC's quoted price was announced for the second time, and they were uniformly reduced again, so people's hearts were even more panicked. In addition, foreign firms were also buying relentlessly, and again absorbed HSBC. The McCarly spot British gold was tightened from 7 to 6.5. After 10:20, HSBC's quoted price was announced for the third decision, and it was reduced again, so people's hearts were even more uneasy. At that time, the softest British gold even called over 6.25, and the tightest US exchange rate also called over 12.25, so the potential was even tighter. Later, it was heard that HSBC's willingness to sell was slightly stronger, and other foreign firms also joined forces to sell slightly. In addition, foreign firms' settlement of accounts became scarcer, resulting in a slight easing of the situation. It is estimated that Datong sold spot US exchange rate to a peer for 13.75. Extending to the noon closing bank selling price, the British exchange rate was 6.9375, and the US exchange rate was 13.625.</p>
<p>The Supply of the Afternoon Market is Slightly Smoother</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms' willingness to sell was still strong, and the market situation continued to ease. First, Youtai absorbed spot British gold from a peer for 7. At that time, Western merchant Sassoon suddenly came to buy fiercely, and the situation became tight again. It is estimated that Sassoon strongly bought in the foreign firm's spot US exchange rate for 13.25, and also bought in the spot British gold for 6.8125. Then foreign firms competed to buy in. The Hollandsche Bank Unie spot US exchange rate tightened from 13 to 12.875. After entering, the foreign firm McCarly stuffed the foreign firm with spot British gold for 6.75. A certain bank also sold the foreign firm's spot US exchange rate for 13.125. At that time, the Hong Kong exchange rate also tightened sharply to around 45 yuan. It was heard that foreign firms also slightly settled in. Extending to the evening closing bank spot selling price, the British exchange rate was 6.75, and the US exchange rate was 13.125. As a result, compared to yesterday's noon closing, the British exchange rate was reduced sharply by .75, and the US exchange rate was also reduced drastically by 1.5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also greatly reduced by 7 yuan after being rolled over at 45 yuan. Now, the opening transaction records for the whole day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Exchange Market also Dropped Sharply</p>
<p>Tianjin, 8th telegram: The exchange market opened this morning, with the British exchange rate dropping sharply by .75 and the US exchange rate also dropping by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous British exchange rate. The Shen Exchange Rate was slightly lower by 2 yuan. The "United Banknote" also rose again by 1.5 yuan. However, Hong Kong was closed yesterday due to the holiday for the British King's birthday, so there was no market.</p>
<p>The Fund is Exhausted and the Rumors are Baseless</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th telegram: The Financial News today published an article discussing China's legal tender. The attempt to stabilize the price of the Chinese legal tender at 8 pence or 8.5 pence has been abandoned. The stabilization fund decided yesterday to let the exchange rate follow its natural trend. It does not want to stabilize its exchange rate again until it has good reason to believe that its price has reached a level that is easy to maintain. The reason for making this decision is that China's commercial trade deficit has increased sharply recently, and a large number of funds have flowed out. This has greatly affected the 5 million pound stabilization fund. It is rumored that this fund is about to be exhausted, but this is completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Surge - Gold Pounds Rise Again by Three Yuan - British and American Banknotes Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold and British and American exchange rates did not change. The fluctuations in foreign exchange in Shanghai became more intense. Foreign firms' clients were settling accounts vigorously, and foreign banks' supply was very weak. HSBC Bank's listed prices changed repeatedly, and the market situation was chaotic. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6.75 and the US exchange rate was 13.125 yuan. The opening was very firm. There was no definite policy on foreign exchange, and people's hearts were panicked. Gold shops and Qian Dui Ye's clients entered together, and sellers were scarce. Supply was difficult, and market prices repeatedly hit new records. The highest peak reached 2,440 yuan. The intensity of the waves was shocking. It recovered slightly in the afternoon, and the changes in the afternoon were still intense. The rise and fall were sudden, often dozens of yuan. The high peak reached 2,400 yuan again, and the closing price was 2,380 yuan. Those who entered the black market were still surging. As a result, it rose another 164 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies rose in pursuit of the repeated contraction of foreign exchange and the rise in price. The demand for British and American gold pounds was very strong, and the supply was not smooth. The trading of British and American gold tickets was brisk, and the market situation was incomparably strong. The demand for Hong Kong tickets was also smooth, and the market price was chaotic and raised arbitrarily. Only Italian and German gold tickets lacked attention. There were many Jews who were expelled and came to Shanghai to supply them. They strolled in front of the Qian Zhuang on Sichuan Road and exchanged their remaining foreign currencies for legal tender, which was quite lively. The price of Japanese gold tickets also rose sharply with the trend, to 9.93 cents in the afternoon. Korean tickets were quite stable, still at 8.4 cents. No trading was done by the association. Yesterday's market price: British and American gold pounds rose by 3 yuan each, British gold tickets rose by 2.5 yuan, American gold tickets rose by .68 cents, Hong Kong rose by .16 cents, the French franc rose by .012 cents, Singapore and Dutch tickets rose by .3 yuan each, Annam tickets rose by .08 cents, Robbie tickets rose by .14 cents, Canadian tickets rose by .55 cents, Philippine tickets rose by .3 yuan, Siamese tickets rose by .3 yuan. Only Italian and German gold tickets did not change.</p>
<h3>The Gold Rush Expands - Creating Another Unprecedented High Price - 2,440 Yuan - Achievement of About 4,000 Taels - The Black Market Cannot Operate...Turning to the Gold Market...Up and Down Between 100 Yuan...Dozens of Yuan Are Not Surprising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was still in a storm of turmoil, and the unprecedented giant wave was fiercer than before. Large rises and falls were rare. It was not surprising to see dozens of yuan of circulation in the middle, and there were often fluctuations of more than 100 yuan. This was really because people's hearts were uncertain. There was a buy in the market, but it was difficult to find an incoming seller. The magnitude of the rise was unseen since there was a gold market. The unprecedented high peak of 2,440 yuan today was really because the foreign exchange exchange rate contracted wildly again. In addition, since foreign firms have stopped supplying non-legitimate foreign exchange positions, general speculators have been unable to move in the foreign exchange black market. They have only been able to turn to the gold market to manipulate it, wildly dragging and entering, and intensifying it, resulting in the tightness of the market, which is truly unprecedented. In the end, because the magnitude of the rise was too sharp, and the foreign exchange black market suddenly had exchange rates and became firmer, it caused a swarm of profit-taking bulls to exit, causing a violent reaction, and it actually fell back to 105 yuan. Finally, the wealthy came to collect, and it rose sharply again, resulting in a sharp increase of 164 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was brisk, reaching about 4,000 taels for the whole day. Silverware gold changed five times, creating a high peak of 245 yuan. Although it recovered slightly later, it finally rose by 16 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold were all flat.</p>
<p>Under the Cover of Spot Gold Buying - Up 164 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, various parties became more determined because it was heard that the exchange rate contracted sharply in both the official and black markets, and the market situation was still chaotic and unbearable, under the cover of buying. It immediately raised 29 yuan. The opening gold shops mutually did 50 taels, priced at 2,245 yuan. Later, it was heard that HSBC's quoted price for the second decision was announced, and it still contracted sharply uniformly, people's hearts became firmer, and the sellers' quotations became more severe, and the rise became more sharp, jumping 36 yuan. Qian Dui Ye entered 50 taels of gold shop, priced at 281 yuan. Later, Qian Dui Ye also released the pan and dragged in more than 300 taels, and it soared by 68 yuan again, reaching 349 yuan. At that time, the gold shops and others made a profit and closed at a high level, and it once fell back to 290 yuan. At that time, it was suddenly heard that the black market for foreign exchange continued to tighten sharply, so the buying spree was rekindled, and the price jumped again by 20 yuan. Qian Dui Ye mutually did 50 taels, priced at 310 yuan. Later, it soared again by 30 yuan, and the gold shops mutually did 50 taels, priced at 340 yuan. At that time, there was still a limited price sale at 340 yuan, so it fell back to 315 yuan. At about 10:30, it was again heard that HSBC's quoted price was announced three times, and it was uniformly lowered again. At the same time, the tight situation in the black market was still severe, and the buying spree was rekindled. Gold shops and Qian Dui Ye scrambled to absorb, and various parties took the opportunity to raise it sharply, soaring by 85 yuan, reaching 2,400 yuan. It was heard that sellers took the opportunity to sell at a high level afterwards, and a slight rebound occurred, falling back to 385 yuan. At that time, it was heard that British gold was approaching the 6 mark, and the US exchange rate was also softening to 12 yuan, so the buyers became more excited, and all scrambled to drag and enter the abuse, and the rising wind was very strong, soaring by 55 yuan. At about 11:00, the gold shop entered Qian Dui Ye 50 taels, and the price soared to 2,440 yuan, an unprecedented new high peak. Later, because it was heard that HSBC's willingness to sell turned stronger, the exchange market eased slightly, and the market situation suddenly became virtual, and the price fell back. A certain gold shop and Qian Dui Ye released hundreds of taels together, and a certain silver shop also scrambled to sell, and the price plunged by 100 yuan, retreating to 340 yuan. Later, many parties came to pull and lift it again, and it rose again to 390 yuan. In the end, because there were too many floating profits and sellers came one after another, it was extended to the noon closing Qian Dui Ye mutually did 50 taels, and the price fell back to 335 yuan. The market opened at 1:45 in the afternoon, and the silver shop helped sell 50 taels to the spot gold shop, priced at 375 yuan, estimated to be 40 yuan higher. Qian Dui Ye came to sell again, falling back to 365 yuan. At that time, it was suddenly heard that the exchange rate was tight again, causing a certain silver shop and a certain gold shop to revive their willingness to sell, and the price was raised again to the 400 yuan mark. After this, it was suddenly heard that the exchange rate was slightly firmer, so the buying momentum turned weak in an instant, and the silver shop helped retail investors compete to sell sharply, and the price fell to 355 yuan. After this, it rose again to 2,380 yuan at the close, and as a result, it rose sharply by 164 yuan compared to the previous day's evening close. It has risen for three consecutive days, totaling the record. The gold shop's own brand of gold is about 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price. According to inquiries, there are markets but no trades, one.</p>
<p>Silver Ornaments Changed Five Times - Hang Up a Huge 16 Yuan</p>
<p>The silver ornaments in each tael were initially priced at 226 yuan at the start of trading. At 9:40, the price suddenly increased by 10 yuan. At 10:20, the price increased again by 9 yuan, totalling an increase of 19 yuan, reaching a high of 245 yuan. At 11:20, it fell back by 5 yuan. At 12:00, it fell back by 2 yuan again. In the afternoon, at 3:00, it leaped up by 4 yuan again. It is estimated that the big peers changed to suspend at 242 yuan. The new peers rose from 224 yuan to 242 yuan. The last one was 240 yuan for closing and 234 yuan for entering.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold and Customs Gold - There Was Actually No Movement Yesterday</p>
<p>London, 7th telegram: British pure gold did not change. Each ounce was still 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 4 points, so the central bank's China spot purchase price was still 1,210 yuan and 9 cents.

The Sino-French US dollar 5% public bonds with Indian debt tickets and the Crisp public bonds each fell by 1 pound. The former fell to 60 pounds, and the latter fell to 32 pounds. The Fix Aircraft debt tickets fell by .5 pounds, priced at 16 pounds. Railway public bonds, except for the Hukwang Railway German-issued debt tickets, the Longhai Railway public bonds with Indian debt tickets, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bonds, which each fell by .5 pounds, the rest each fell by 1 pound. It is estimated that the Daoqing and Hukwang German-issued were each 19 pounds, the Hukwang non-German-issued was 20 pounds, the Longhai with Indian was 17.5 pounds, the Beijing-Shanghai was 23.5 pounds, the Tianjin-Pukou original continued issue English-German each were 16 pounds, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon was 19 pounds. The buying and selling prices were heard that the selling price of the rehabilitation loan English-issued was 45 pounds, but the London telegram had 5,000 pounds for sale, and the asking price actually reached a huge 47.5 pounds. Also, 5,000 pounds of French-issued with Indian tickets, and the selling price also reached 45 pounds and 5 shillings.</p>
<p>The black market for securities, yesterday's market situation, was stable again. Cash was difficult and rose wildly by one hundred and several tens of yuan again. Foreign exchange changed several times a day, but the general big players were indifferent. Their observation point focused on the transfer of political aspects, but it was inevitable that it was too early. As always, they advocated engaging in lifting, and retail short-sellers covered at a low price. The market price rebounded, and they re-covered the short position, so the price rose step by step, similar to the market price on Monday, and even better for Class A. The Bingxu class broke through the 3 yuan mark again. Judging from the prospects, the rising surface must already be limited. Yesterday, after the initial opening, it was weak and then firm, and it was a few corners higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, it rose again, and the Bingxu class broke through the 3 yuan mark again. Both buyers and sellers, only Runli Company, always absorbed, and Tiensheng advanced first and then exited. In the morning, Lianhe and No. 41 also had a strong intake. In the afternoon, Defu and Tonghe etc. always surged. Retail investors always covered, which was extremely enthusiastic. The total number of transactions for the whole day was estimated to be around 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: The performance of 50 shares of China Electric Power, priced at 5.625 yuan.</p>
<p>The London British Far East Company's stock quoted prices on the 7th of this month (Wednesday) were stable, with only the McCarly Bank shares rising slightly by 2 shillings and 6 points, priced at 8 pounds. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Public Industries Association reported that yesterday's stock market situation was even more enthusiastic than Wednesday. The large number of transactions meant that cash settlement was required as soon as next week. Since the abolition of futures, it has never been seen as numerous as it is now. It is now difficult to choose which stock is particularly prominent, because most of the stocks, although the bulls came out at the last time, their profits were only the tip of the iceberg compared to the highest time, but they could probably have a surplus of 5% to 10%. It seems that what can be paid attention to is that today people take buying stocks as the best policy to protect their assets, and are less concerned about settling in foreign exchange. They also firmly believe that exchanging 35 yuan for one pound or 8 yuan for one US dollar is not the best and most cost-effective way to protect their assets. However, buying rubber and industrial stocks will not only be profitable, but also stable interest. However, on the surface, several stocks seem to have risen too fast. However, after careful study, each well-known rubber company (i.e., those with larger output and lower costs). The high stock value cannot be said to have increased in price with the depreciation of the monetary system, but there is still room for development later. Yesterday, the most fluctuating were Jardine Matheson, Sihai, Tram, and Kaiping. In terms of rubber stocks, they were English-Hua, Kelohua, Tanah Merah, and Rubber Trust.</p>
<p>The large transactions this week will all be settled next Monday. Now, the board of directors has decided that Monday morning will be dedicated to clearing the settlement matters, and the market will open and continue trading as usual at 2:30 pm.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers - Speculation Still Uses Drafts as a Tool - The Rising Wind of Cotton Yarn Intensifies - New High Peaks Emerge Endlessly - The Order of the Market is Extremely Chaotic</h3>
<p>The situation of the current yarn: The opening price in the morning was more than 450 yuan for the spot price of a certain foreign warehouse inherited from the previous day. The opening price was increased by 5 yuan to 215 yuan. The warehouse order price was 449 yuan. After a while, it fell back by 5 yuan. Because the spot sales could not afford it, it was not long before it was heard that the draft was opened and the listed price was reduced by one level. The buying interest followed, and the market was as chaotic as hemp. Large quantities came to snatch again. In a flash, it jumped horizontally by more than 10 yuan. The spot price of Double Horse was 460 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 452 yuan. The buying and selling in the market surged greatly, and the market price opened and rose step by step. By the closing, the highest price for Double Horse was 466 yuan, and the warehouse order was also made to 460 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors were still rampant, and everyone used the draft market price as a tool, suddenly entering and suddenly exiting, and it was very lively. The gold industry also came to enter the yarn. The opening price for 20 strands of Double Horse current yarn was 468 yuan. As soon as the high price was seen, a certain party suddenly came to sell it, and it fell by six or seven yuan in an instant, making it to 461 yuan. It was said that the draft had turned long, and there were no major changes afterwards. By the time of closing, it was written at 462 yuan, and the warehouse order price was 454.5 yuan. It is estimated that various gangs bought a total of 2,890 packages throughout the day. The market price for 20 strands of Double Horse rose by 12 yuan, the price of the Shepherd rose by 6 yuan, the price of Wufu rose by 5 yuan, the price of Double Earth rose by 6 yuan, and the price of 10 strands of coarse yarn rose by 3.5 yuan, etc. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The daily yarn market continued to rise. The actual transaction was not developed. The buying and selling were all speculative. The current month price for 20 strands of Yueqin yarn: The morning closing price was 392 yuan, and the noon pan was 395 yuan, which was another 7 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Fire Engine T'ung-Hua Cotton Follows the Rise Directly Upwards; Most Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Observing; Firms Settle Prices on Profitable Orders</h3>
<p>The cotton business has picked up slightly, but sales prices are affected by the shrinkage of the foreign exchange rate, which has led to the soaring of the yarn market. As raw materials are closely related to the yarn market, they naturally followed suit and rose. Fire Engine and T'ung-chou cotton both rose by two or three yuan, but the printed cotton ordered by the Xinsheng Factory rose by about five or six yuan, with 1,000 bales transacted, all of which were delivered to the factory on the spot. Other yarn factories have not taken any action. From northern Jiangsu, only 161 bales of T'ung-chou cotton arrived, and 72 bales from Beisha. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was particularly active yesterday. It rose first due to good news from Bombay, and then due to purchases by firms and short covering. The government's climate report stated that there was excessive rainfall in various cotton-producing areas last week, which affected the harvest, and all parties were very excited. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace is scheduled to dine with President Roosevelt today to discuss proposals and plans for the World Cotton Conference to be held in early September. It is said that the conference supports each member's own development, and the main point is the issue of U.S. cotton exports. Yesterday, New York rose by more than ten points, and India, along with forecasts, rose sharply by more than three rupees. Egypt also rose by more than ten points.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp contraction of the unofficial foreign exchange market in Shanghai, foreign exchange rates varied. When converted to legal tender, it rose nearly ten yuan. There were no transactions all day long. However, those who had previously ordered goods from firms settled their prices with foreign firms one after another, and each bale could obtain an average profit of more than ten yuan. The factories, observing the chaotic foreign exchange market, although they had a strong intention to purchase cotton, all temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The factory price converted from yesterday's cotton market is listed below:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Hoarding, High Spirits; Ewo Coarse Cloth Rises by 7.5 Jiao; Morning Market in East Goods Is Very Chaotic</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market for domestic cloth still changed dramatically. Piece goods and cotton materials are mainly based on foreign cotton, so the impact on yarn and cloth is extremely sharp. However, after the previous day's extensive hoarding of plain white cloth by firms, the source of cheap goods has been cleared. Yesterday morning, all parties in the market were calm and watching for changes. Sales to customers were sluggish, and there was no intention to purchase greedily. The market was calm. Before long, the foreign exchange rate rose again, and speculative thoughts were stirred up. The factories began to push up prices, and firms and outside groups immediately released prices to search for goods, and the market rose sharply. Ewo coarse cloth rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt, and Chinese-made coarse cloth and coarse twill also rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by 1 to 2.5 jiao per bolt. A total of 300 bolts of coarse cloth and more than 200 bolts of fine cloth and fine twill were transacted. The asking prices for colored cloth, colored twill, flannel, and dark-colored autumn goods all rose by 1.5 to 5 jiao per bolt, but the current advance price can still be loosened. Plain printed cloth is still supplied at the original price, but local customers are not paying attention due to sluggish sales. With the implementation of Shanghai-Ningbo joint shipping, the Ningbo group slightly loaded more than 100 pieces of Ewo coarse cloth and other goods yesterday. Local street dyeing factories handled 200 bales of fine cloth and fine twill, and the Zhejiang and Guangdong groups were heavily involved in handling colored cloth and colored twill.</p>
<p>East Goods Piece</p>
<p>The rising trend of white goods is suddenly strong. Due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the thoughts of both insiders and outsiders are becoming more and more optimistic, and the intention to hoard is strong. They are rushing to search for goods. The highest bid for Longtou fine cloth has been over 14.6 yuan, and futures were once sold at 14.75 yuan. The market situation is very chaotic. Until the latter market, some speculators who grabbed hats made profits and released them, and the spot price fell back to 14.3 yuan. The final result was 14.4 yuan, and 14.5 yuan for the next month. Hoarders and firms buy and sell from each other, totaling about 3,000 bolts of fine cloth and fine twill transacted, and the price rose by 3 to 5 jiao per bolt. The actual sales business on this street and in the northern district also reached 1,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Food: Flour Mills Hoard and Restrict; Customer Orders Are Rejected; No. 2 Flour Increased by 5 Fen Yesterday; Not Many New Wheat Arrivals; Prices Are Good</p>
<p>Flour continued to rise firmly yesterday. Since the continuous contraction of foreign exchange in recent days, financial problems have become more complex, and the prices of all kinds of goods have risen. Foreign flour and wheat are closely related to foreign exchange, and people are optimistic about the price increase. Various factories are stubbornly unwilling to supply large quantities and are implementing sales restrictions, so customers are rejected. Only small-scale retail transactions on this street are slightly supplied. Yesterday, the price of No. 2 flour from the factory was raised by 5 fen to 4.45 yuan. It is said that foreign flour has also risen from 4.35 yuan to 4.23 yuan. According to grain merchants, the current exchange rate is extremely tight, and the cost of foreign flour arriving in Shanghai in the future will be even higher, so those who hold goods are waiting for a good price. However, in the current extraordinary period, market changes are unpredictable.</p>
<p>In terms of wheat sources yesterday, in addition to a small number of old wheat continuing to be shipped, new wheat arrivals have been temporarily lacking. However, Australian foreign wheat is arriving one after another, with a total of three ships arriving, totaling more than 23,000 tons. In the midst of this foreign exchange contraction, the exchange rate has been further affected. Also, at the beginning of the new wheat season, the environment is unfavorable. The factories and customers are all quiet. Although those who hold goods are optimistic about the price increase, they all intend to wait for a good price, but it is difficult to achieve it for the time being, so the entire day's transactions have become quiet again, and the market is still stagnant.</p>
<p>Imported foreign wheat is coming in steadily, and foreign flour is also being imported. The Nanjing, a ship of the Yaga Shipping Company represented by the Great Britain Company, arrived in Shanghai at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 7th), from Australia.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, 80% of Rice Was Moldy; Prevention of Variation and Steaming; Market Suddenly Became Tense Due to Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Since the invisible lifting of price restrictions on domestic polished rice in the market about half a month ago, the market has appeared to be small. Taking the usual high-quality 18 yuan rice as an example, it has fallen by nearly one yuan, and the price of intermediate goods has fallen by about 1.5 to 2 yuan. The reason is nothing more than the congestion of goods in warehouses and the ordering of foreign rice. Yesterday, due to foreign exchange, it was said that the ordering of foreign rice had been suspended, and the source of river rice was scarce. Only 21 No. 1 arrived. The wheel package was only 3400-3500 bags. Also, 2880 bags arrived from Hong Kong. People's hearts suddenly became excited again. Hoarders' appetites were extraordinarily lively, and brokers' minds were not in harmony. The market opened tightly in the morning, and the price rose all the way. The outlook for each item was unclear. The usual high-quality rice was once quoted at 18 yuan, but until noon, the market turned flat again due to the lack of real appetite on this street. As a result, the usual high-quality rice was actually opened at 17.6 yuan, and Wuxi's special high-quality rice was opened at 17.5 yuan. The prices of other rice were all raised by 4 or 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Due to its structure, thin rice was slightly inferior to rice in price, with an increase of 2 or 3 jiao.</p>

<h3>Same Surname</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>In China's patriarchal society, the power of the same surname is very great. To bring out a famous ancestor and claim to be his "distant descendant" can certainly intimidate people. Even in a gang fight, shouting "All those with the surname ×, come on!" can preemptively seize the advantage and win victory.</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzhong, who almost slaughtered all the people of Sichuan, wanted to form a clan with Emperor Wenchang. When he encountered the temple of Zhang Huanhou, he did not dare to destroy it. Huang Chao, who killed eight million people, did not kill people with the surname Huang. Even Huanggang and Huangmei counties were spared from the massacre because they had the character "Huang" on their heads. The power of the same surname extended to bandits. No wonder the power of the same surname has not declined for thousands of years, and now it is even more intensified.</p>
<p>What is called intensification is not my nonsense. Some people, in addition to wanting to obtain the power of the same surname, and being unable to think of a way for a while, have to trace back to Taoyuan, compare themselves to the Three Elegances Garden, make a pact and compile a family tree to increase their influence. They also set their sights on many foreign tycoons. It is said that there is a person named "Gao Erchu," with the character "Er" as his generation name and "foundation" equality. In addition to forming a clan with the great Russian writer, he can also be regarded as his compatriot and brother. Therefore, there are also people with the surname Xiao who, according to the ancient example of "Boda Boshi," named themselves "Shugui" to call themselves brothers with the British "George Bernard Shaw." …</p>
<p>I think this may not necessarily be seen in reality in the future: people with the surname "Ma" named "Ckeshi" or "Fusi"; people with the surname "Xing" named "Zhongchang"; people with the surname "Luo" named "Silu"; people with the surname "Shi" named "Danfeng" or "Qinglin"…. It is a pity that China, apart from a "Mo Di" in ancient times who was suspected of being an Indian black charcoal, does not seem to have anyone with the surname "Mo" now. Apart from a "Mr. Xiyi" who reclined in Huashan Mountain in ancient times, there is no one with the surname "Xi." Otherwise, wouldn't the "honorable surnames" of modern eccentrics be able to be brought into our "Hundred Family Surnames" by means of these wonderful people with the surnames "Mo" and "Xi," to form a prosperous clan?</p>
<p>Some people say that if Chinese people really do this, there is nothing wrong with it, because foreigners also do the same. There are many wealthy people abroad who spend a lot of money to have genealogies made to prove that they are descendants of some famous person. There are also many warlords or celebrities who add words such as Von, de, Don to their names to indicate that they are descendants of some noble. They also have a prevailing "endogamy system," which is even worse than China's "no marriage between people with the same surname." But although this is reasonable, it misunderstands my meaning, because I do not look down on people who are so good at forming clans and compiling family trees, but sincerely praise them. This statement still confirms the greatness of the power of the same surname, which has existed in foreign countries since ancient times.</p>
<p>However, foreign affairs are too vague after all, so let's turn back and talk about ourselves.</p>
<p>In some organizations, they are controlled by people with a certain surname. From the leader to the servants, most of them have the same surname. Therefore, some people call this organization a "family temple of a certain surname," believing that this should not be the case. However, I think this is okay. Wasn't there the "Yue Family Army," "Yang Family Generals," and "Xue Family Generals" in ancient times? Moreover, the world has been controlled by one surname since ancient times. Those with a certain surname are following the ancient ways, are they not ancient people! Ancient people! The dead are all good, and ancient people are especially good. If not "former kings," at least "former people." We really should not wantonly criticize them.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to agreeing with those who strive to cultivate the power of the same surname, I would also like to contribute some opinions for their reference. I don't know what they think:</p>
<p>If the surname is "Kong," you can bring in "Kong Ming" and "Peacock" as clan members, because since those with the surname "Zhu" and the surname "Ge" can look up to Mr. Wolong, those with the surname "Kong" can naturally follow the example and not fall behind. As for the "Peacock," Yang Xiu of the Han Dynasty had already called it Confucius's domestic fowl. Similarly, those with the surname "Yang" can, as Kong Qun said, take "Yangmei" as their family fruit; those with the surname "Han" may wish to invite "Hanlu" to join the clan; those with the surname "Song" may wish to invite "Songque" to join the family tree… In this way, the power of your surname will become even more powerful, and everyone will look at you with awe and dare not despise you.</p>
<p>A scholar with the surname "Liang" is unwilling to take "Boluan" and "Taisu" as his ancestors, but is willing to take "Lüzhu" and "Hongyu" as his female ancestors. Another staff member with the surname "Jiang" is unwilling to randomly form a clan, but recognizes himself as a descendant of "Jiang Zhushan." These people are really extremely stupid and should never have any success in their lives. Those who aspire to fame and fortune should never learn from them!</p>
<h3>Pit (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Dian Chang</p>
<p>I walked down the bridge, swaying and dawdling. My eyes stared straight ahead, ignoring the guy on the right.</p>
<p>My legs staggered along, feeling quite relaxed, but I also glanced at him from the corner of my eye: he stood there like a half-burnt yellow candle, straight and stiff. I couldn't help but laugh…</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard the sound of leather shoes and a gun butt. I quickly turned to the side: the guy was pointing the muzzle of his gun right at my belly button. I slowly raised my hands, wiping the smile off my face. However, he put the gun back on his shoulder and took out a short rod from his waist, marching towards me with measured steps.</p>
<p>He fished out three legal tender notes and eight Qin Hui notes from my pocket. He hurriedly stuffed the three notes into his pants pocket but tore all the Qin Hui notes to pieces. He smiled sinisterly, pointing to the foot of the bridge over there. I saw that a pit was being dug over there. He looked like a mute, raising his right palm over his head and making a straight gesture with his left palm at leg level. So I swallowed and walked over. The pit was only three or four feet deep and a little wider than a person. A small shovel was stuck in the dirt pile beside the pit.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He made the gesture again and smiled sinisterly. Did he want me to dig? Were there weapons buried below? Or was his father's grave underneath? Then he waved his gun at me. Only then did I stubbornly stick out my neck at him and smile back just as sinisterly. I picked up the small ghost shovel and tried it out, lightly — if it were longer, I could chop it right at him, sending his damn half-burnt yellow candle to the west. So I brandished it a bit, and he got angry. He scrunched up his eyebrows, gritted his teeth, and moved his legs back a little, stomping his feet. His expression was like an old monkey whose tail was on fire, screeching in vain.</p>
<p>I pretended to look ahead nonchalantly, but it was empty, without even a ghost in sight. Damn it, I had no choice but to "respectfully obey the order" and dig. As I dug, I stole a glance at the guy. He was fiddling with his gun, so I retched loudly. He jumped back suddenly, but moved his legs back again, pointing the muzzle at me. So I dug again, dug… It was very dry, so I spat some saliva into my palm, rubbed it around, and dug, shoveling. After a while, I glanced at him again: he was smiling again with that evil grin, then leisurely pulled out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and started puffing away.</p>
<p>Digging, digging, carrying the mud, I went two feet deeper than before. I stopped to rest and retched loudly again. He sauntered over, patted me on the shoulder, and made the gesture again: did he want me to go that deep? You're pissing me off today!</p>
<p>I wielded the shovel lazily, wondering: how many weapons were buried below, and who left them here? I was really puzzled! Digging, digging, digging, hey, hey, I was digging up his ancestral grave, digging, digging, digging, the pile of mud beside the pit got higher and higher… Strange! I felt a sudden sharp pain on my shoulder and turned my head: he had just hit me with the butt of his gun. I yelled: "What? You bastard…" The muzzle was pointed at my throat, black and oily. I muffled a groan and bent down again to dig, digging, damn it! I spat hatefully, rubbed my hands: if I really dug up a gun down there, I'd use it to get rid of this guy, just like that! One on one, couldn't I do it? Really shameful; okay, dig, dig, dig.</p>
<p>I looked over again. He was bent over picking up the torn pieces of the notes. His half-burnt yellow candle-like body looked even shorter. Suddenly, my heart almost jumped out of my chest, and I couldn't help but raise the shovel, leap out of the pit in one swift movement, and give him a faceless blow… I was just about to do him in, but he stood up, straightened his long gun slung over his back, and yelled.</p>
<p>I shivered and pretended to dig again. I stole a glance at him and saw him hand over the torn banknotes, wearing a ferocious face. I ignored him. He stomped his feet and muttered as he walked away. I couldn't help but curse inwardly, and I raised the shovel, hey: splattering the mud over there, a lot of it got on the guy's leggings. He suddenly turned around, quickly stepped back a few paces, stomped his feet, and gripped his pistol tightly, cocking it… but then lowered it again, only grumbling hatefully. I couldn't help but suppress a laugh and stoop to dig, dig. I wanted to lift the shovel and splash him again all over his head and face, but I didn't do it this time.</p>
<p>He was humming up there like he was singing, very unpleasant, bleak and miserable.</p>
<p>By this time, only a little bit of my shoulder was showing above the ground. Looking at the front, I saw a blood-red sun hanging in the grove, empty and cold… Only then did I get worried. I wiped the sweat on my forehead and dug again, dug, dug.</p>
<p>Now, my body was completely buried in the pit. Only my head was still above the ground. Dig, dig. My hands were getting sore. Damn it!</p>

<h3>How to Renew the Spirit—A Changed Life (7)</h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>I often hear people say, "Don't force me to do this or that. When I feel the need, I will naturally do it."</p>
<p>The most perfect and complete life is a life of unified personality, a life in which every move naturally expresses itself from the heart. Spiritual mobilization is not an outerwear that everyone can wear, nor is it an ornament, but a great movement of inner reform. It demands the highest price from everyone. Whether you are willing to pay this price is up to you.</p>
<p>There was a college student who found life boring and very unhappy, and his heart was full of hatred—he hated the principal and dean of studies at his middle school. When he was studying in middle school, he was expelled by the school authorities because of his bad behavior. One day, he met a friend with a Christian spirit. After talking, he unconditionally surrendered himself to Christ and also did something he would never do. He went to apologize to the principal and dean of studies. From then on, his life changed greatly. An active, progressive, and happy spirit replaced a decadent, stagnant, and melancholy life. Only people like him can be considered spiritually mobilized. He has broken free from the shackles of private life and can concentrate on promoting spiritual or moral revolution among his classmates. Shanghai Christian Literature Society P.O. Box 1227</p>
<h3>Undersea Village</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>A few years ago, because of the scarcity of land and the large population, the Dutch government fought the sea, spending huge sums of money to build a giant dam several miles off the coast, then draining the water and filling it with soil, which has now become a fertile field. This was all due to the Dutch water conservancy engineering, which is unparalleled in the world, and its greatness is admirable. The Netherlands spent so much manpower and material resources to obtain a small piece of land, which can reflect the value of land in Europe. Then, isn't it a waste of natural resources to have vast land and not know how to use it, letting it lie fallow and useless to the people? This issue of "Magazine Digest" reprinted an article from the London "Listener" about the situation in this new land, which is very interesting. Now I will translate it as follows:</p>
<p>There is a place in the Netherlands that was seabed eight years ago, but has now become a thriving rural area. I had a cup of tea with a Dutch farmer's wife living there a few days ago. The farmhouses in the area were all built by the government. Each house has a barn and cattle pen, which are arranged very cleanly. The farmer's wife invited me to see their black and white cows, about thirty in total, which were tied in rows in a brightly lit pen. Next to each cow was a copper can, and they would use their noses to open the lid of the can, and then trigger the mechanism, so the water would flow out. This is not an exaggeration. I have personally seen them do this. The land around the farmhouse is flat, crisscrossed by paths, and endless. I have never seen such neat fields in the countryside I have visited. There are also white and bright red farmhouses, like sparse stars, dotted among them, reflecting each other interestingly. Cars often sped by on the quiet brick roads. All of this makes it hard to imagine that this was still the seabed a few years ago.</p>
<p>In this underwater village, there is now running water and electric lights, and telephones will also be available next year. All this comfort and safety depends on the giant dam, 26 miles long, built on the coast of the West Sea of the Netherlands, which blocks the water of the North Sea and turns the Zuyder Zee into a clear water lake, part of which has not yet been reclaimed.</p>
<p>Before completing the great project, the Dutch government built an island in the sea, and then gradually expanded the dam until it became a narrow opening. The rapid currents of the North Sea poured in from this narrow opening, and their momentum was very fierce. Closing this narrow opening was extremely difficult. Every time sand and gravel were poured down, they were washed away by the seawater. But time after time, the narrow opening was finally successfully closed, and now the water of the North Sea has been subdued. Farmers are farming peacefully in the fields, and farmers' wives are sitting quietly at home, listening to the radio broadcasts, enjoying the happiness of a comfortable rural life. They told me that it took six months to drain the water in the first bay, and then it took two years to remove all the salt contained in the soil. At first, because the soil was loose and wet, it was impossible to cultivate with horses, so machines were used instead of horses. Since then, fields of wheat, barley, and rye have gradually appeared. Because this land was formed from the sea, many strange problems have arisen, one of which is the fish problem. For example, the fish in the Zuyder Zee were originally brackish water fish, but now they have become fresh water fish.</p>
<h3>Hometown Rain</h3>
<p>— Wei Ming</p>
<p>After a long and embarrassing run, I finally stopped here, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>×, you must be laughing at me. Yes, I myself don't understand why. I've changed, I often feel inexplicably lost for a long time, not speaking or moving, staring blankly at the white clouds or stars in a daze. Being in such a "cage," surrounded by gloom, looking out the window, everything seems to be covered with a layer of dark gray, so people also seem to be painted with heavy dark gray, feeling waves of coldness coming over me.</p>
<p>You know that I deeply love the rain in my hometown, and lately I miss it even more. When people are lonely, past events naturally come to mind. Even trivial things that are so ridiculous can make me nostalgic, and now is the rainy season in my hometown!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When the sunlight timidly withdraws the gold smeared on the tips of the willows, and the whirlwind is like a whistle, getting tighter and tighter, then the rain that nourishes the soul—I call it the rain that nourishes the soul for a reason, and I need it—sends me a visiting card. So I hold my favorite book and lie on the mat in the bamboo garden behind the house, quietly listening to the subtle sound of the rain, which is played like a heartstring, savoring the sad and beautiful verses, my attention is divided equally between them.</p>
<p>Drip—drip, dripping on the sharp leaves, which are so bright that they are about to melt, seems to be telling an ancient and sweet story. Then it falls again, each time bursting out with a round and crisp sound. Opening my eyes, I see a flash of bright white light, which is the stream surrounding the bamboo garden, crystal clear like a beautiful silver ribbon. Raindrops touch its face, immediately creating a ripple of smiles, letting the drizzle caress my hair, I really understand the meaning of "the wise delight in water."</p>
<p>I also like the refreshing and comfortable atmosphere after the rain, the dazzling verdant green of the washed leaves, and the tender and angry growth of the grass.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I don't have the courage to recall it. Writing to you, I am complaining in a painful tone, and also raising a faint sorrow like light clouds.</p>
<p>×, you should understand me.</p>

<h3>Planting Opium Poppies in Shan-Tung</h3>
<p>Two Westerners went to visit the Kong Lin [Confucius Forest/Cemetery], and it is said that all the fields on the road in Qi-Lu [Shandong province] were planted with opium poppies, endless at a glance, with lush flowers and leaves. Surprised by this, they questioned the farmers, saying: "The local government has already issued a notice prohibiting it, how dare you deliberately violate the prohibition?" One of them replied: "That is certainly true, but the local officials sometimes supervise the people to pull them up, but only a few acres on the sides of the official road. The so-called 'obeying orders' today is only to deceive the eyes and ears of the superiors, how can they see the affairs of the western fields and southern acres under the yellow silk quilt?" Hearing this, the Westerners could not help but sigh deeply.</p>
<h3>British Erecting a Plaque on Jinshan Island</h3>
<p>The British steamer "Garth Castle," sailing down from Hankou, headed straight for the ocean. The sun had already set in the west, and fog permeated the air. The ship continued onward through the fog, and around 12:30 AM, a mountain suddenly became vaguely visible, looming directly in front of the ship. This mountain was Jinshan Island. Immediate orders were given to turn the rudder to avoid it, but the swift currents made it difficult to maneuver, and the ship ran aground. The ship's captain and crew were rescued by the islanders, who provided them with food and clothing, showing the hospitality of the locals. Now, the British Consul in Shanghai, Mr. MacMurray, together with Mr. Sandow of the naval vessel, commissioned craftsmen to create a plaque reading "Saving All Living Beings," to be hung in the island's sea god temple. The plaque is lacquered and gilded, measuring seven feet in length. The inscription reads: "The British ship "Garth Castle" met with disaster here, losing both people, ship, and cargo. The stranded Westerners descended into small boats, and twenty-four people were rescued and landed ashore. Fortunately, the residents of this village provided meals and lodging, treating them with great kindness. All those in distress are deeply grateful," and so on.</p>
<h3>Setting up an Altar to Pray for Rain</h3>
<p>Due to the prolonged drought, civil and military officials of Shanghai, together with the people of the city, have gone to the Temple of Guanshiyin in the Chenxiang Pavilion, and to the Dragon King's shrine, to set up altars and pray for rain. Furthermore, from yesterday onwards, slaughtering has been prohibited, and all markets and gatherings among the populace are observing a fast, hoping to receive the response of sweet rain.</p>

<h3>Reply to Gentlemen Chen and Guo</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>On the fourth of this month, I wrote an article entitled "The 'Mongol' Affair." A discerning reader could clearly see that the Japanese side was exaggerating the incident and over-reporting it. Even an unperceptive reader would see that the purpose of the article was merely to stimulate the Soviet Union to change its rigid stance by exposing its incompetence. This was the sole purpose of the article.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Gentlemen Chen and Guo sent letters questioning and criticizing me. Mr. Chen even accused me of undermining Sino-Soviet relations, which is an excessive and inappropriate statement. If my single word could truly undermine Sino-Soviet relations, then it must also be able to improve them. The destruction or improvement of Sino-Soviet relations is something that even our Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador to the Soviet Union cannot simultaneously accomplish. How could my single word be enough to undermine those relations? The authority of my words is such that I should be proud.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Guo's comments, they are somewhat immature. His conclusion that "my distorted views attempt to confuse the public" is merely an attempt to confuse your own views, but it cannot confuse the views of others. Moreover, your views are confused by yourself, not by me. If you do not confuse yourself, then no one can confuse you.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Bazaar Movement in the Women's World</h3>
<p>— Nan Yan</p>
<p>"Professional Women" to Hold a Bazaar Starting Next Month. Airing a Broadcast the Evening Before to Collect Items for the Women's Fundraising Bazaar</p>
<p>Let us expand the fundraising bazaar movement. All stores, cultural organizations, and restaurants should participate in this extraordinary mobilization.</p>
<p>The art world's fundraising bazaar movement has already been held and has achieved excellent results. The theatrical world will hold collective, large-scale fundraising performances, which is even more exciting for us.</p>
<p>However, the "inaction" of general stores, theaters, and restaurants amid the calls for a fundraising bazaar movement seems somewhat infuriating. Do these workers not have even a little sense of justice?</p>
<p>For example, the women's world in Shanghai is remarkably calm about this fundraising movement. Apart from one embroidery school that held a small fundraising bazaar, why are all the women's organizations in Shanghai, all the women's universities and middle schools, and all the female employees of the stores, not rising up to carry out a large-scale fundraising bazaar movement?</p>
<p>Ladies and misses who wear "different shoes," perm your hair in various styles, and hold men's arms, you seem to have forgotten your responsibilities. Now, under the general slogan of "fundraising," for the sake of the refugees across the country, and to save your sisters who are living in refugee camps, are you willing to ignore them?</p>
<p>Women, please stand up and do some work for "fundraising"!</p>
<p>What I know is that on July 1, 2, and 3, a women's organization in Shanghai will hold a large-scale fundraising exhibition. The items for sale will mostly consist of embroidery. The location is the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association.</p>
<p>This women's organization is the Professional Women's Club.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, they held a fundraising broadcast at the Continental Radio Station to promote their fundraising tickets, which are priced at five jiao, one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. In addition to the "Professional Women's" singing, the broadcast program included Chinese music and singing by the "Friends Society" and the "China United Entertainment Association."</p>
<p>The program was quite wonderful. For example, Miss Zhao Rui'e of the "Professional Women" sang four songs in Chinese and English by herself, Miss Qian Qi also sang two English songs, and Miss Li Yang also sang four of the latest songs. In addition, there was a violin solo by Miss Mao Xiu-ying, and a four-part ensemble of "Song of Shanghai." The "China United" also had a particularly unique "Siamese Poem," all of which were rarely seen wonderful programs.</p>
<p>The broadcast studio was so hot that the ladies were all wiping the sweat from their faces, singing the most delightful songs into the microphone. On the telephone, many listeners donated embroidery items to participate in the fundraising, and many people also bought fundraising tickets.</p>
<p>Outside, in another room, many of the singing ladies were practicing their songs to the sheet music, and a wireless radio on the table broadcast the programs being performed in the broadcast studio.</p>
<p>Miss Mao, the host of the Professional Women, did not even have time to eat at 10:30 PM. Miss Wu Mei, who hosted the broadcast, was busy coming and going, reporting on the broadcast program to the microphone in the broadcast studio, hoping that the listeners would donate more, and then coming out to tell whoever was next to perform.</p>
<p>From 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM, many people did not rest. Miss Wu Mei's hand was full of lists of people who had donated embroidery items for the fundraising. They worked hard all night.</p>
<p>However, I must offer a few suggestions regarding this "fundraising" by the "Professional Women":</p>
<p>Could you invite more women's organizations to cooperate in holding the event together? This would make the items on display more extensive, and the effect during the fundraising days would be even greater.</p>
<p>If other women's organizations cannot participate in this fundraising, could you ask them to solicit "fundraising items" from the women's world to make this fundraising exhibition more extensive?</p>
<p>However, this "fundraising" initiated by the "Professional Women" deserves much assistance from all aspects.</p>
<p>We hope that other women's organizations can also gather together in the short term to hold a large-scale fundraising movement!</p>
<h3>Mr. Feng Chaoran's Work (Imitation of Shigu)</h3>
<h3>Xu Shichang Commemorative Coin</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that former President Xu Juren passed away in his residence in Tianjin at the age of eighty-one. Xu was highly accomplished in literature and advocated governance through culture during his tenure. The inclusion of Ke Shaomin's "New History of Yuan" as an official history was announced during Xu's term. I still remember that in September of the tenth year of the Republic of China, Xu cast a commemorative coin. One side featured Xu's portrait, and the other side depicted palace buildings and trees, with the inscription "Longevity and Happiness Together." The craftsmanship was extremely exquisite, but it was rarely seen in circulation. Recently, I read Mr. Jiang Zhongchuan of Suzhou's "Illustrated Explanation of Chinese Gold, Silver, and Nickel Coins," which contains a picture of this coin. I am eager to transcribe it here, so that readers can still get a glimpse of Xu's cultural achievements at the time from the shape of this coin.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Recognizing Hometown Relatives, the Old Mortar and Pestle Life; Attaching to Power, the Newly Rich Aristocracy</p>
<p>However, Zhao Letian was furious when he received this letter. He thought: Like father, like daughter, it's really not wrong. I acted out of good intentions, teaching his daughter to persuade her father to get back on the right path and not go astray. Unexpectedly, I was rebuffed, which can be described as "biting Lü Dongbin, not knowing a good heart." If it were her father's handwriting, that would be fine, as he is already deeply mired and there is no way to help him. I originally felt that it was redundant. But now this letter is in Peiying's own handwriting. I am very familiar with her handwriting. Her words are so cold towards me, as if my writing to her only increased her aversion. Moreover, she said that she did not want to receive my letters in the future, and would not reply even if she received them. What is this supposed to mean! In the past, we had always addressed each other as brother and sister, of course, to show affection, and also because our two families were distant relatives. Now I write to her, still calling her Little Sister Peiying, but her reply addresses me as Mr. Letian. I won't even care about these minor details regarding the address, but the most unreasonable thing is that the reply says something like "Everyone has different interests, and we should each go our own way." Then she also followed her father's ambition? Pitiful! Hateful! Zhao Letian felt indescribable indignation at this time, thinking that women in the world are simply unreliable. Like Pan Peiying, we were considered to have compatible temperament, and she used to be passionate and a very enthusiastic girl when she was a student. Who knew that it was just a pretense to deceive people? But why did she change so quickly? A woman's heart is really unfathomable. Zhao Letian was filled with hatred and anger, but he was not willing to give up. Unable to sleep at night, he wrote another long letter to Pan Peiying. In the letter, he both blamed and persuaded her, hoping that she would have a reply. But after this letter went out, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. At that time, Zhao Letian had no appetite for tea or food, and could not sit or lie still. He was completely disoriented, feeling that he was truly in love with Pan Peiying. He felt very distressed because Pan Peiying rejected him. Finally, he wrote another letter to Pan Peiying, expressing his determination to break off the relationship, the general idea being that he would rather lose love than lose his ambition. Soon you will hear the news of Zhao Letian sacrificing himself for the country. My soul will always be cleaner than yours, right?</p>
<p>This letter was seen by a close friend of Zhao Letian, who said: "Letian, you are too infatuated. Why bother with this kind of woman?" In fact, Pan Peiying did not receive any of the letters Zhao Letian wrote later, as they were all confiscated by her father. (131)</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Blockheads"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“Block-Heads”</p>
<p>A MGM Production, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>"Blockheads" is the last film in which Laurel and Hardy collaborated. After this, they will separate. Hardy has continued to sign a contract with MGM, and the company is already looking for a replacement for Laurel. Laurel, on the other hand, has sued the company for the losses he suffered due to the dismissal. What impression Laurel and Hardy's films leave on us is not discussed here for the time being, but these two clowns who have always used silly movements to elicit laughter from the audience will probably feel a little sadness about this separation.</p>
<p>Among the feature-length works they have starred in, there are indeed some that are commendable, but they ultimately cannot withstand the loss of simply making a fool of themselves. However, after seeing "The Flying Deuces," I felt that they had given up their "leading role" and were only playing an important "insertion" in a work. In this way, it is easier for the playwright to give them some gimmicks, and the entire play can also benefit from their help and achieve the effect of supporting roles. If they continue to develop in this direction (the Li Zisan brothers also have a slapstick "Three Musketeers"), Laurel and Hardy seem to have a greater need to cooperate, but they ultimately separated. According to the news, both of them are a bit proud, as if their "fame" was not due to the cooperation of the other party. After being proud, they naturally despise their opponents; after despising them, they naturally want to try to handle things alone.</p>
<p>In fact, as I said before, their works are still based on making a fool of themselves, so I agree with them taking the path of "The Flying Deuces." But now, they actually want to try to handle things alone.</p>
<p>In that case, we will wait and see.</p>
<p>"Blockheads" is almost a sequel to "The Perfect Marriage." However, the script is quite compact. Their consistent silliness is still the same as before, but after the war ends, Laurel guards alone in the trenches for twenty years; when Hardy goes to pick up Laurel, he thinks he has been injured and has had one leg amputated; the various accidents on the thirteenth floor... these gimmicks are also quite fresh.</p>
<p>However, "Blockheads" is only a short film, and the scene in the bedroom is already annoying. They want to star in a feature film alone. We feel that we should wait and see even more.</p>
<h3>"East Side of Heaven"</h3>
<p>“East　Side　of　Heaven”</p>
<p>New Universal Export, Shown at the Grand Theatre</p>
<p>I don't know what Bing Crosby's status is in Hollywood, but in China (or rather, Shanghai), he has lost his audience. Why? In a word, it's because of the emergence of singing stars!</p>
<p>We know that half of the voice comes from hard practice, and half depends on talent. Bing Crosby may not be unwilling to improve, but he is indeed unable to develop his singing voice. However, he is ultimately the "King of the Crooners." If he has a suitable script, it is not difficult to conceal his shortcomings and show his strengths.</p>
<p>But look at "East Side of Heaven": Although Bing Crosby does it from start to finish, and sings from start to finish, he is simply a complete failure in such a "Hollywood-style comedy."</p>
<p>The director is also not very good, so Joan Blondell only serves as an active background when she appears.</p>

<h3>Definite News about the Bai Family's House Performance</h3>
<p>— Former Owner of the Dragon and Phoenix Fine Arts Studio</p>
<p>A Conversation with Mr. Zhang Xiaolin</p>
<p>Since this newspaper published the "Amazing Theatrical News" by the Master of Plum Blossom Hall, all those who love drama have been very excited. I have also spent a lot of time and effort inquiring about the news from relevant parties. After the Master of Plum Blossom Hall's instructions, I learned that the main figure in charge of this house performance is Mr. Zhang Xiaolin, the host of the grand house performance held at the Dahua Garden last time.</p>
<p>I became even more interested in this news, so yesterday (the seventh) afternoon at four o'clock, I made a special trip to Mr. Zhang's residence on Rue Wagner to visit Mr. Zhang, the chief director of the preparations for this grand house performance. When I arrived there, Mr. Zhang was sitting on the porch, talking to some friends. After I explained my intention, Mr. Zhang showed a kind and amiable smile. The following is the conversation I had with Mr. Zhang:</p>
<p>(Question) The Shen Bao published a news report about Mrs. Bai's 50th birthday, saying that a grand house performance will be held. Is this true?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is true, but things changed yesterday.</p>
<p>(Question) How did they change?</p>
<p>(Answer) Mrs. Bai's relatives saw the news in the Shen Bao and expressed great dissatisfaction. They believe that under the current circumstances, it is absolutely inappropriate to hold such a grand house performance. At the same time, General Wu Ziyu, an old friend of Mrs. Bai, also sent a telegram, politely dissuading her. In his telegram, he also mentioned his hope that this house performance could be postponed until the country is stable in the future. However, the preparations for this matter are almost complete, and it is very difficult to cancel it. It is still not officially decided whether this matter can be terminated. It will probably be decided tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Question) How long have you been preparing for this matter?</p>
<p>(Answer) We have been preparing for this matter for a long time. Although the Shen Bao's "Entertainment World" was the first to publish it in Shanghai, everyone only found out about it in the last two days. But in Beijing, it has almost caused a sensation throughout the nine cities. Otherwise, how would General Wu Ziyu know about it?</p>
<p>(Question) If the house performance is definitely held, will all the famous actors listed in the newspaper come south to participate?</p>
<p>(Answer) Why not? It can be said that when the day comes, everyone will rush to get here.</p>
<p>(Question) Can Yu Shuyan come too?</p>
<p>(Answer) Why can't Yu Shuyan come? Don't say in Beijing, even if he is abroad, we can invite him to come. Today (referring to the seventh), a gentleman in the Shen Bao said that if he comes, he will be sorry to the previous celebrities who organized house performances. This is a joke! The reason why Shuyan couldn't come before was because he was sick and his voice was not good. Now his health is good and his voice has recovered. There is no reason why he wouldn't come to sing. Moreover, Shuyan sent a telegram here a few days ago, saying that not only will he come himself, but he will also bring his top student Li Shaochun to wish Mrs. Bai a happy birthday.</p>
<p>At this point, it was already late, so I agreed to meet again later and left.</p>
<p>(Latest News) Yesterday, there were rumors outside that the famous actors Xun Huisheng and Meng Xiaodong had already arrived in Shanghai, and that Mei Lanfang would set off from Hong Kong within three days. After verification by this newspaper's reporters, this is not true. Whether the Bai family's house performance will be held according to the original plan will be decided tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Even if it is held, the invited famous actors from all over the country are expected to arrive in Shanghai in three or four days. In short, this journal will report on how this matter develops as faithfully as possible. Please stay tuned.</p>
<h3>Remembering Liu Baoquan's One Evening Conversation (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>— Miscellaneous Memories of Mei Bian</p>
<p>The Origin of Drum Books is Very Valuable</p>
<p>In addition to the melody, Baoquan also paid special attention to the rhythm. He once requested that drum books focus on seven-character, eight-line verses, which must be simple and clear, not with too many auxiliary words or none at all. It is necessary to have rhythm when there is no rhythm, and rhythm within the rhythm. These few words can be said to be a deep understanding of the essence of drumming. Baoquan's skills became more refined, and his reputation grew, but he was still not complacent. His open-mindedness and humility were also the reasons for his fame. When he first sang in Yinanying, there was a man named Li Sanye who was engaged in Mongolian trade and had a lot of wealth. He was also most fond of drum books. He would occasionally sing a song during banquets, and his voice would amaze the audience. Baoquan gained much guidance from him. Every time Baoquan took the stage, Li would be present. He would close his eyes and concentrate while listening, silently without saying a word. He would hold his water pipe, looking like he was asleep. When Baoquan saw him in the audience, he would work even harder and not dare to slack off. If Li nodded slightly, Liu would be happy! His nodding was his way of praising the performance. If he shook his head, it was equivalent to disapproval. After the performance, he would definitely go to ask for advice, stopping only after receiving his nodding approval. He was so self-motivated! Zhang Congde was also as famous as Baoquan. Xiao Jiao Tian was deeply fascinated by him and was almost always present in the audience. When Baoquan was in his fifties, he first came to Shanghai and said that after returning from northern Shanghai, he sought further improvement and gradually felt that his skills were improving. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he was hired in Hankou and gained a good reputation. However, he left one regret in that place because the person who played the strings for him drowned in the Han River. The night before he took the stage, his face was ashen, causing fear among the onlookers! The next day, he went out to swim in a shallow pool alone and drowned. The string player is important when Baoquan sings, like the buttocks. Because he needs to be familiar with the singing method and provide appropriate accompaniment. Over the decades, only Bai Fengyan has been the most pleasing. The next best is Yu Boqing. The person who has been following him recently has also been with him for more than ten years. When he first came, he knew nothing. Baoquan personally gave him instructions, and he was able to achieve success. Baoquan has traveled throughout the provinces of Henan and Shandong, and his fame has spread everywhere. Military officers and soldiers were especially fond of him. He once visited Qufu, and the Duke Yansheng treated him as a distinguished guest, staying at the mansion for several months. Baoquan can perform hundreds of songs, but students have only learned more than twenty. He does not like to record sound clips because he hates being bound and unable to improvise as he pleases. When singing on stage, he does not follow the same pattern and occasionally makes changes. He has never accepted any disciples. Although there are people who claim to be students of Liu, most of them are just borrowing his name and are not true heirs. He has a son studying at the Beijing Business College, who now handles trivial matters for his father. Before singing every day, he does not dare to eat too much. After the performance, he will eat a little. He avoids meat, fish, and alcohol to protect his throat. From childhood to old age, he has no other hobbies except for strings! When he first came to Shanghai, someone criticized him for only being able to sing and not understanding music. Liu was angry! He led the person to the backstage of the New World, where there were huqin, pipa, sanxian, xiao, and dizi. Liu picked them up one by one and played them, more skillfully than an expert. The person then admired him greatly! He has a special fondness for the pipa and believes that he is the best.</p>
<p>The old man also mentioned the founder of the Double Huang performance: His name was Huang Fuchen, and he lived around the time of Emperor Xianfeng and Emperor Tongzhi (1850-1875). He had a limp and was very ugly! He was also a storyteller. Because one person could imitate the movements of various characters, it was called Double Huang. At that time, there was a common saying, "Let me see you imitate Huang Fuchen." Later, it was divided into two people imitating one person. He liked to keep a beard and especially liked snuff. After Huang, Xu Gouzi was the best. He also added the Lotus Fall section and made it for both men and women. As for the Lotus Fall, in the past, it was sung to persuade people to do good, and the lyrics were mostly taken from the Persuasion to Goodness Canon, not like the current songs that are sung to earn money. As for the Eight-Cornered Drum, it was a victory song from the conquest of Jinchuan. There is no such thing as learning the art from a teacher. They are all children of wealthy families. If someone needs them, they are invited to sing and do not receive any compensation. There is a four-line mantra: Righteousness is stronger than strength, Longevity is boundless, No need to bother with tea and water, Food and drink are prepared. Unexpectedly, the amateur performance later turned into a professional performance. In recent times, there are even people who make a living from this. In the past, there was also a famous singer of fast stories named Kui Songzhai who enjoyed a good reputation in the northeastern part of Beijing. But now there is no way to hear this good news again. He was originally an amateur actor who practiced the old male role in the Erhuang opera and was famous at the time. One year, Baoquan was in the same class at the Qingfeng Hall sacrifice. He played Lu Su in the Gathering of Heroes, and he was lifelike! At that time, he was praised as a living Lu Su. Like the current Shi Xiongri, reminiscing about the past successes in the opera world, I truly feel that it cannot be obtained again!</p>

<h3>New Drama Preview</h3>
<p>The Green Field Troupe, located at No. 1, 2nd Floor, Coal Industry Building, Tianjin Road, has been established for a month. With the invitation of famous playwrights Yang Xiaozhong and Tang Jie to serve as instructors, they have achieved remarkable results. It is said that the troupe plans to present wonderful masterpieces such as "Night Run", "Father Returns", and "Oppression" to the public. They are scheduled to perform at the Xianle Grand Theater on June 18 to satisfy the public's expectations.</p>
<p>Cao Yu's original work "Sunrise" can be said to be the most exciting in the third act. The Shanghai Amateur Drama Association, in view of this, decided to perform the third act of "Sunrise" separately. It is said that rehearsals have begun, with Mr. Chen Xihe serving as director. It is scheduled to be performed on the morning of June 18 at the Xin Guang Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Drawing of the Entertainment World</h3>

<p>(3) Suzhou Ballad Singing</p>
<p>"Storytelling" is divided into major and minor categories. Major storytelling is called "Pinghua," while minor storytelling is the "Suzhou Ballad Singing" mentioned here.</p>
<p>The musician on the left plays the sanxian, while the musician on the right plays the pipa. Single-person performances use only the sanxian.</p>
<p>Liu Jingting is said to be the first Suzhou ballad singer in history. After Jingting, this art gradually became extinct. Ma Rufei's "literature revives the decline of the Eight Dynasties" established the position of today's Suzhou ballad singing in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>"Secretly arranging a marriage in the back garden, the fallen young master wins the imperial examination" is the consistent theme of Suzhou ballad scripts.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Forbids the Saying of "Conquest of the East"</h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>Only by Sleeping on Brushwood and Tasting Gall Can One Wash Away Extraordinary Humiliation</p>
<p>There was originally a storytelling book called "Conquest of the East," which tells the story of Emperor Taizong of Tang's conquest of Goguryeo. There is a popular saying, "Xue Rengui crosses the sea to conquer the East," which has been circulating for a long time. However, according to a recent account from someone in Suzhou, the City and Township Book Market Tea House Industry Association received a notice from the police department of the puppet provincial capital, stating roughly that the book "Conquest of the East" involves "inconveniences" and should be banned immediately, and its title should not be displayed. As a result, the employees who usually tell this story are greatly alarmed, and they have requested to change the title to "Generals of the Xue Family" and tell the story of "Ding Shan's Conquest of the West," which has been approved. For the time being, there will be no place for Xue Rengui in the Suzhou book market, and his son Ding Shan will have a monopoly, it is said.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Biggest Reason Why Yu Shuyan is Unwilling to Perform</p>
<p>Even Japanese publications continue to publish news about Shuyan's upcoming performance at the Bai residence, which has attracted much attention from the public. Some theater fans are even preparing to send birthday gifts directly to the Bai residence, hoping to get a seat at that time and enjoy the feast for the eyes and ears. This shows that the enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai for welcoming Yu is at its extreme. However, whether he will actually come to the south is still a question. I remember three years ago when I was living in my hometown, a wealthy businessman from Beiping, surnamed Yang, celebrated his mother's birthday and prepared a grand performance at the Zhiyun Guild Hall outside Zhushikou in Qianmen to entertain the guests. Yang had several ginseng shops and banks in Beijing and Tianjin, with assets of several million. At that time, he was willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars to invite Shuyan, Xiaolou, Yanqiu, Xiaoyun and others to perform their masterpieces. He asked someone to seek Shuyan's consent first, and he had already agreed, and the opera was set to be "Beating the Stick and Leaving the Box." The playbill was printed, and the news spread, causing a sensation in the nine cities: I don't know how many theater fans were all hungry and ran early to occupy seats. The opera on the stage had not yet started, and the Zhiyun Guild Hall was already crowded. I, together with Madam and Miss Yuan Liang, and Secretary General Fu of the municipal government and his wife, asked the Qianmen branch director to reserve a few seats in advance. After finishing official business, the whole family hurriedly rushed to the Zhiyun Guild Hall without even having a good meal. Our seats were originally reserved upstairs, but the stairs were full of people. Those who wanted to go upstairs could not go up, and at the same time, the ladies upstairs (in Ping City, men and women still sit separately, and female guests are all upstairs) who wanted to go downstairs to relieve themselves could not go down either. It was pitiful for them to be trapped in the crowd, and many of them were desperate to relieve themselves. Since we had reached the point of sighing in vain, we had to give a tip to two policemen who were in charge of seating and walked out disappointedly. This matter was nothing to me personally, because I had seen too many of Xiaoyu's operas. Taking "Beating the Stick and Leaving the Box" as an example, I had heard it five times, and the supporting roles were all people like Jin Fuchanglin. However, Mr. Fu had a great addiction to opera, and seeing his expression, he was still reluctant to leave. Therefore, we went around from the small alley on the east side of the door to the backstage, and they all squeezed at the exit door, standing behind the stage. Only then did we achieve our goal.
