<h3>德陸空軍增援薩爾　西線反攻並無進展　法軍物採取穩紥穩打戰略　出奇制勝佔領重要陣地</h3>
<p>比京　據萊因區傳來消息稱、德軍司令刻正掌備應付英佚軍之全力進攻、途中軍隊雲集、聞德空軍多隊、已從波蘭前綫調赴西綫、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國增派大軍增援薩爾、以冀阻止法軍接近齊格飛防綫、故今日西綫戰事更形激烈、據今晨一時三十分（上海時問上午九時三十分）傳來消息，穗軍現正以全力實施抵抗、薩爾白魯根附近之山地、戰事更為劇烈、按該處位於蘊爾谷之上、高出地面的一千英尺、森林地勢極為險要、穗軍決以全力阻止怯軍在薩爾河建立液橋、怯軍於午夜將發出公告、謂進攻形勢極佳、注軍已然蘸爾森林中廿二處村莊中之德軍掃除一淸、由坦克車掩護下進攻，已超越數處德軍地雷氈，此數地雷區為齊格飛防錢之前衛、僅距十二英哩、據法軍方面消息、穗空軍於撾去二十四小時中、在西錢極為活躍，怯室軍之飛往齊格爾防綫援偵察雄軍動靜者曾與之相通，（十日美聯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　絲司令部今晚發表第十二號戰報稱、「敵軍正在全修抵抗、並在某某地方反攻、我軍某師山奇制滕、業已攻佔重要陣地一處、敵軍砲險現頗沃動、我方寧軍首於本日賡續作值察飛行、未因敵軍縣逐機之出動、而受影響、」（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　總司令部今晨發表第十三號戰報云、一敵軍曾於昨日、在前綫多處地方反攻、戰事形勢並不因而發生變化、吾國飛機仍照常飛往敵境偵察」、（十日哈瓦斯電）。</p>
<p>巴黎　總司令部頃發表之第十號戰報、詞意簡略、半官方面又依照昨日辦法加以解釋云、敵軍雖於昨日反攻、但我軍仍能堅守前此所已佔領之陣地、連夜予以鞏固、同時並將通至後方之交通綫加以壇強、至以戰事形勢而論、東西蘸綫完全不同、東錢德軍以其強有力之摩托化郁隊尚波蘭各主要交通權進拽、波蘭國則以騎兵自側面襲擊、以言西錢，則法穗兩國均以步兵為主力，而以砲兵工兵暨其他專鬥部隊輔之、質言之、吾軍在前係採用穩紮撇打步步為營辦佚、戰綫亦不甚長、我軍每决攻佔一地即加以鞏固、使之成為後方陣地、亦即將來進攻之根據地、此與穗軍在東綫之長馴直入截然相反云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　半官方面調査西錢一帶情况稱、西境戰事仍不過在」接近局面、與砲壘戰中、尚無軍隊猛攻之問題，私軍先顯部隊與工兵團專門員，刻右祐方由年設餡算之區從事肅淸工作、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間所發戰報言簡意賅、苟細繹之、則可見西陣綫之眞相逐漸顯明、萊茵河旁鋼骨水泥之碉堡、隔岸對峙、做容砲戰，此段陣禎始於勞時堡、止於盧森堡乃最塔注意之處、德方齊格飛陣錢一帶情形、向為人所不明瞭者、但自戰事爆發以還、法方飛機顯往偵眾、攝取德方防錢各點之照片、今巳將此照片集合而繪成群細地圍義此陣禎前、有所謂「無人地」者、深三哩至六哩不等，注軍所當首先注意者即在此地、法軍先頭隊現已向此推進、肅淸機關槍埋伏處與哨位、俾澀達齊格飛陣綫本身、注軍此種戰略、使鷓奇諾陣綫有從容呼吸之時間、而以堅如做幕之天空防禦、保持其秘密、不為德文所窺見、同時馬奇諾陣綫後之偉大的動員、無時不在進行、法軍刻正砲轟齊格飛陣綫、以試騅強力而覓取其弱點、昨夜此間所發表之戰報、言及地雷雀域及摧毀其防禦工事者甚為明瞭、按地雷區域乃德方破壞坦克車之防禦佈置、而防禦工事則包括橋梁興地道如薩爾河橋等在內、據中立方面之報者、薩爾白魯根本境居民業已撇退、德國因受此租壓力、故調往波蘭前敵之德軍行動現已稍緩、可見英法參謀部碩迫西境以解東境危急之目的、現已漸著效果矣、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>八月杪，本報根據倫敦電訊，英國外相哈立法克斯氏對中國駐英大使郭泰祺氏提供保證，略稱歐局縱使劇變，英國遠東政策決不改變云云，有所評述。今者，德國對波蘭開火，英法對德國宣戰；惡濁卑怯噯昧陰森之和平空氣，夙昔籠罩歐洲，迷惑人類者，至是而如姻消雲散；砲火連天，蔚為黎明之曙光，血腥遍野，灌溉人文之園地；苟安酣夢，瞿然醒覺，歐局既劇變矣。乃於此際，復悉郭大使與英外相復於本月八日交換意見，兩氏同意於中英兩國有利共享，而對抗侵略允證同心；英外相更聲明英國遠東政策仍未改變，又確認中國之獨立與興盛，實於英國利益與世界和平、均屬重耍云。中國於數年來備嘗慘痛，飽經世故，凡百言辭，聞之已熟，當不以哈氏一言而有受寵若驚之感；雖然，中國亦既於甘苦之中。得來經騐。蓋英國今年「九三」，恰似中國前年一七七」；英國於今年九月三日對德宣戰之前，含垢忍辱，委屈求全，其首相張伯倫氏外相哈立怯克斯氏以决，為各方輿論所嘲諷唾駡，以視七七中國實行全面抗戰之前，曾何以異耶？及至忍無可忍，勃然赴戰，於是無雜念，無歧途，大道昌明，性靈皎潔，一往無前，義不返顧。此種心安理得之神聖境界，非「九三」後之英國，不能體會「七七」後之中國；亦非經甘苦，不能體會；非相體會，不能契合；吾人於是乎想像英外相此决所語於郭大使者，誠推心置腹披肝瀝胆之談；非可與中素泛迂之外交辭令等量齊覜者也。</p>
<p>侵略，人類野蠻習性之暴露也。戰爭，人類超越理智之作為也。文明人類之舉動，必勤求理智以為依歸，輒視戰爭為罪惡；殘酷非理智，戰爭影響必殘酷；詎知侵略罪惡浮於戰爭。世界第一决大戰結束迄今廿一年，瘡痍猶未盡復，殘酷之印象猶深深鏤刻於理智者之眼底心頭。故張伯倫氏之倫，雖目擊一部分人類之發揮野蠻習性，而其不戢自焚之理智，竟為殘酷印象所錮蔽，且又一念僥倖於禍不及已；彼於半載之前，非慨然晤告其國人乎，余不願及身而復見戰爭之殘酷也！詛知野蠻習性有其暗示，傳染，蔓延之機能，不旋踵而自遠東及於歐陸，卒使張伯倫氏喚起更深之理智而不得不躬我宣戰。夫擯絕史汀生氏之建議，捐棄國際聯盟之制裁，犧牲捷克以饜饞吻之嘗試，當時為英國計之，慷他人之慨，遠是非之門，自不失為謀國之正常理智；誰知野蠻習性絕非正常理智所得而抬療；必也，解放理智所錮蔽之戰爭，始足以謀遏止。蓋罪惡惟侵略，戰爭非罪惡，而對抗侵略，不辭一戰，允至仁至義，大勇大智也。</p>
<p>抑人類習性，實向多方面發展，相率為善則向善，獎勵為惡則向懸；而一般理智實已共臻相當之水準，初非文野之殊，有如霄壤；則彼暴露其野蠻習性者，半由一己意願使然，半由環境放縱所致。非必始終其習性也。此屬老生常談，顧於今茲之英國對德宣戰，竟發現常識以下之現象。不聞宣戰後，傳自丹麥荷蘭諸中立國之德國消息乎？英國決心履行援助波蘭之義務，乃至宣戰，竟非德國朝野所始料也。不聞德國戈林上將於開戰經六日，昨向工人所發表之演說乎？抨擊英國矣，猶望英國首相張伯倫氏抉擇於和戰之間；可知英國之決心對抗侵略，猶非今日德國之當局所深信也鰍嗚呼，此豈德國朝野之愚之痴？察三五年來之事蹟，國際固放縱侵略也，獎勵侵略也，未嘗懲惡勸善，宜乎其國其人之習性向野蠻方面發展矣。國際宜不容侵略，然近年之放縱獎勵，亦近乎陷人於不義矣。時至今日，英國既揭對抗侵略之幟，始知中國之興之志同而道合，此實數年來不經見也；德國得此當頭棒喝，終必無幸，則凡在發揮野蠻習性者，其亦恢復其理智，幡然改圖，廢然知返乎！謂必不至末日不汛者，竊未信人類智愚之竟如霄壤；謂必懲一不足以做百者，竊未信人類之浩刧無窮也</p>
<h3>英政府訓令各機關　準備三年戰爭計劃　非至打倒希特勒主義不止　決心絕不為和平宣傳動搖</h3>
<p>倫敦　情報部宣佈、戰時內閣、定今晨開會、俾假定戰爭延長三年或三年以上為基礎、決定政策、刻正發出訓令、分我各行政機關、務須依此假定、立卽著手掌備未來計畫、其業已籌備之各種計畫、刻須積極付諸實施、擴充國防計畫、刻已在進行中、軍需部將立卽採行必要步驟、務使各種製造軍火能力、有大規模之增加、俾應付各種形勢、海軍部與空軍部刻正作相當佈置、為國家利益計、內政上需要及輸出貿易之維持、亦在兼籌並顧之中、戰時內閣確信此項重耍決議、定可得國人之一致贊助與同盟國及友邦之歡迎云、路透社外交訪員稱、最堪重視者、不為政府以三年或不止三年戰爭為共政策之基礙、但為英國打破希特勒主義之決心、堅持到底云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間外交界人士頃宜稱、德國一俟在波蘭國境內佔有充分優勢之後、貽將提出「和平建議、」屆時自必屬意於義國首相縱索里尼，請其出任居問人、惟英國負責人士均謂、此種建議、並不値得考慮、英國政府決定聯合各同盟國、賡續作戰、直至國社主義傾視而後已、此際、波蘭國軍隊仍能作長時期抵抗、加之英法兩國在西綫進攻之後、必能收牽制之效、而大有裨於波國抗戰云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>東京　軍事參議會前委員中村海軍大將今日聲稱、希特勒為「陸地人物、」忽略英法海軍之決勝力、而未予以充分考憲、今一般悄况、對於穗國、較一九一四年更為不利、縱華沙為德軍所佔、義國出而調停、然欲英法給予德國以其所需、殆不可能云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　強毅報批評德國速戰速決與英法拖延戰爭、俾獲全勝、兩種不同之戰略、謂據各事察之、希特勒似自曰、「余將迅速盤敗波蘭、然後議和、」但希特勒誤矣、此乃觀於英相張伯倫在下院所發宣言而可蹬。明者云、（九</p>

<h3>戈林演說　離間英法脅誘和平　謂波蘭軍事四星期可解決　此後和戰要求張伯倫答復</h3>
<p>柏林　航空部長兼許魯士總現戈林上將今日正午在柏穌附近德馴最大軍火廠台吉爾兵工廠向全髒工人發表演說、首述靦洲各國引起戰爭之各秋事件、繼稱德國有兩道防綫、第一綫係兵士、第二綫係工人、允其軍火工人、提及現時戰事、戈氏對於英釀大事抨擊、力言＼波蘭所以敢悍然拒絕元首之寬大提議者、完全因有英帝國之保護、吾等在五大洲上對於英懸利益、均加以承認、從未過間英國政務、但每當吾國探取保護正當利益之措施時、英國必出而干涉、橫加阻撓、英國倘欲避免大規模之衝突、只須對於波蘭施予有効之墜力、使其接受溫和的德國提議、顧於事援揚言、欲以談判解決嚴重問題、寗非欺人之談、數日以來、英甌政治家聲稱、彼等非係對德作戰，而係對希特勒汝纖社蒸政府作戰、顧賽開槍之時、則係對德國人民而發，英國又標榜道德、自謝此决參戰、係為保護小國而戰、實則按之歷史、英帝國為全世界吞併弱小民族最多之國家、其所以成殼大國家者、完全係此種方法所造成、然則道德云者、是又欺人之談也」、</p>
<p>戈氏繼稱、「英國向德國挑戰、的有三種方法、（一）軍事的、（二）經濟的、（三）內政的、軍事方面、德國一國敵英法波三國、但德則西面工事、固若　湯、海岸防務、亦復無隙可乘、波蘭戰事、可望終縝星期內摧毀主力、再兩星期肅淸殘部、共計一月當可結束、然後東錢七十師兵力抽調赴西、則德軍地位、絕非較劣、重以德蘇巳締協定、德國決不致旗背受敵、而能專一對付西綫、此在英瞬當亦瞭然、今英國飛機惟來德散發傳單、倘其以炸彈易傳單、則德國亦當作同樣行動、故英國軍事上之對德挑戰、決難達到成功、</p>
<p>其次、經濟方面、余敢公開宜稱、穗國乃全世界機構最健全之國家、即以軍火生產制度而論、德國可謂曠世無匹、今日吾等當前惟工作一事、不問其他、別國雖有較多之金銅鍚鋅、但德國有最能幹血最願工作之工人、過去成就確佳、今後更須加緊努力、德國原料雖稱缺乏、但其中最重要之兩種煤與鐵、則尙有餘裕、而况若干原料、德國除加某種限制外、更發明有若干代替物、較之英國原料、必須強迫由遼遠屬地運往島嶼者、尚覺爲疾而用舒、故無論此次載爭、延長多久、穗國經濟組織、決無影響、」</p>
<p>戈氏繼論及封鎖問題、指陳德國今日之遭受封鎖、與第一次世界大戰完全不同、當時英國封鎖西面、俄醱封鑽東面、若千小國、封鎖東南、今日則因各中小國之中立、德國所被封鎖者、不過丹麥至巴斯里而已、德蘇兩國、旣決心聯合、決不為英珊犧牲、自相殘殺、蘇波兩國、均有充分之原料、供給德靨、與英作戰、東南甌各小國、對於參加英熙之包圍計劃、必加三思爺行、若有不穩、則德國當以迅電疾省之行動、以奠定之、第一次大戰時、德國戰錢長至三千八百公里、此决西續戰錢、則不過二百五十公里云、</p>
<p>戈氏至此申明德國對法、並無所求、倘美顯加入封鎖德國並不憂慮、因年來兩國貿易、極為不振、美貨斷絕、並無若何重大影響也、</p>
<p>提及波蘭各種暴行、戈氏質問英首相張怕倫曰、「倘張伯倫先生仍以波蘭民族為有價值民族、是亦道德之羞也、德飛行員三十一人被迫降落、槪巡波人暗殺、閣下以為如何、余甚願於下决谿會演說中、「聆閣卜之答覆也」、</p>
<p>戈氏最後宜稱、「此次宣戰、係張伯倫、而非希特勒元首、德國對法幷無要求、隨時願與不壓迫穗國、不迫設日耳曼之國家、謀求和平、但同時亦作一切準備、遇必要時、苦戰到底、德國之願望和平、決非示弱、和戰謝鍵操之對方、德方惟盡力與之周旋而已、所須鄭重申明者、德國人民與元首間、有不可分性、元首印德國、德國即希特勒云、（九日海通社電）</p>

<p>日軍封港完成封鎖</p>
<p>據官方消息、邊境日軍不特未撒退、且擴大行動、惟南頭方面之日軍、確較三四日前减少、但不知是吾退回運輸艦上，相信南頭日軍之調動、仍在寶安境內、又據官方消息、日軍軍事行動、已伸展蘋馬士灣前岸區域、故現已完成香港之封鎖、又悉連日傳南頭日軍開始撤退、其撇退原因、顯係抽調軍隊、乘運輸艦赴大亞灣、企圖在該處登陸、其目的為完成封鎖香港邊境之計劃、聞日軍一旅團（一萬二千餘人）沿馬士灣及大亞灣分界之半島尖端駐紮、直至南頭、日軍封歟結果、本港除澳門一路外、已與內地完全隔絕矣、</p>

<h3>投資西南問題</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>上月中句，本市銀錢業聯誼會舉行過討論投資西南的座談會，到銀錢工商各業人士二上餘位，編者以業外之身參與其盛，獲益匪鮮。該會原擬將紀錄嵇交本刋披露，嗣以分量太多，改山吳胡史關叫位先生各任一題，完成這集體作。四位先生均係經濟專家，對上海經濟前途，都很悲觀。同時都把投資西南作爲調整上海游資和產業困難最合理的出路。吳先生把過去投資西南失敗的癥結指出了不少，認爲主要的在上海有厚利可圖。史先生消算了國家現行政策之後，認爲有來一個反繁榮政策的必要。但胡關兩先生指出上海和香港的繁榮業已吿終，優厚的利潤正在西南，待着各地的資金流去，但必須配合着生產工具。如移轉貨幣資金，與先生認爲以外匯最適宜。這些見解可說是今决再檢討中最大的收穫。但編者認爲尙有一個重大的問題還沒有解决。就是一般人把投資西南和放棄上海混爲一談，依編者個人所見，覺得這是一個危險思想，應該鄭重周密的考慮才行！本期地位突縮，關先生之文臨時抽出，謹致歉意。</p>
<h3>過去的癥結何在</h3>
<p>— 吳鴻安</p>
<p>遠在一年以前，投資西南的口號早就很熱烈的喊過了；但過去的執行還不够努力，在實踐的過程中還存在着許多急待解決的困難，成效有限得很。原因雖然很多，上海生意容易做而且能賺大錢，不能不說是一個基本障礙。</p>
<p>戰後上海因人口與資金集中，進出口貿易放仟與外匯黑市買賣方便，工商業都非常活躍，利潤亦極優原；金融業正常出路雖較前狹小，但外滙的黑交易與套利，却有利可　。資金往利潤最高的她方流，而且從最熟習的地方走，乃是必然的道理，內地確是一個寳藏，處處正待開發，但究竟還是一塊處女地，要發財還得用點心血而且還得冒相常危險；上海旣安全，亦有利，除掉極少數民族意識較强，識見特廣的資本家而外，誰願撇開現錢不賺而捨進就遠呢？</p>
<p>第二：上海的工業環境也此內地良好。八九十年來的發展已使上海變成一個最重耍的近代化的經濟中心，有各種各樣大大小小的工業聚集着，工廠間的連繫與需要做得非常配合；此外，原料的購取，製品的推稍，倉庫堆棧保險等等的設備，動力的供給，工有的熟練，金融業的繁盛，……沒有一樣不比內地方便，返觀西南，工廠則東一個西一個的分散，原料，工人，動力，金融機關等等的條件比上海都差得遠了。</p>
<p>第三：交通不便，運輸費用的負祖過重也是過去廠家所以沒有能夠了順利內遷的一個主要原因。上海與西南的交通，現在只好繞道海防由滇越鐵路以達滇川各省。滇越鐵路的運輸量是極小，每天一百噸的容量怎能應付東南各處湧進去的貨品呢？因此大都堆積起來，聽說有許多廠家把機件運到海防之後，半年沒有消息，連東西在什麼地方也找不到了。西南各處間的運輸如昆明至重慶肌都靠公路，公路運費的奇昂也是人所共知的。在汽油可以用八便士一五購買時，由滬經海防而昆明而重慶的運貨據說每噸就要二千五六百元，現在當然更貴了。</p>
<p>第四：內地與上海款項調撥的困難，即申滙太貴，也是投資西南的一個很大的障礙。政府限制內地滙款來滬，目的在防止資金逃避到匕海來買外滙，原則當然無可非議。但內地滙到上海來的款項，種類很多，性質各異，有為工商界在內地貨物售出取回之代價，有為內地工作人員向滬滙寄之家用，有為殷富資金之逃避，有爲金融界內地資金之移滬運用；假如將後兩種和前兩種同樣看待，則工商界貨款一入內地，即有被封銷危險；誰還敢和內地發生關係並進而遷入內地去生產呢？假如一個上海技術工人到了內地後所得的工資要打一個對折才能滙出，那他又何必到內地去辛苦呢？所以申滙限制過嚴，使正當與不正當的款項一律難於流動，實在是一個亟待修正的政集。</p>
<p>此外內地封建勢力的阻撓，日機的到處在炸，也是使人對投資西南引不起興緻的原因，惟轟炸一層自信託局辦理轟炸區後已不成大問題。</p>
<p>因爲上述種種原故，所以除戰事初期由政府協助內遷的　百多家工廠以及戰後由幾個大銀行住西南少數重要城市中新設的幾種大工業而外，一年半來上海對於西南投資的成續實在是微乎其微的。</p>
<p>至於金融業的活動，本以產業的繁盛爲基礎。在投資對象尙屬稀少的西南，金融界不能在那兄大有作爲。有許多人以爲只要把上海的游資大量運去內地便可以達到投資西南的目的；他們却沒有認識：單是幾張法幣决不能算是資本，而把一部份法幣運去內地也决不能呌做對內地的投資。資本是必須能够生產的物資如機械，原料等等，也只有把法幣變成這樣的物資並使其在內地活動之後，才能算是對內地的投資。單有法幣內移而不輔以生產力的擴展，只能使內地陷入通貨膨脹的深淵而不會有其他好處的。但是一般余融界及殷富所持有的外匯，如能以適當的方式獻給內地，那是一個有力的貢獻，因爲，外匯是現在中國對外的一種最有效的購買力，也是一種最珍責的資本。</p>
<p>至於政府，過去在促進投資西南這一工作中雖已盡了不少力量，但努力仍嫌不够。牠在內地旣沒有儘量爲工商界及金融界排除各種障礙，實行各種保險，保息，津貼，調查，報尊等等提携領導的工作，也不够有力；在上海，非但對各種投機取巧未曾及時調整與取締，反長時間維持，上海外匯黑市，使上海工商業得以畸形繁榮，這更不能不說是政府過去的一大錯誤。</p>
<p>現在，黑匯是不維持了，工商業的繁榮也一天天的趨向沒落了，政府應當趁此客觀環境轉變時，施用適當的政策：一方面對上海經濟活動加以的束，一方面更在後方廣闢大道使孤島的資力物力能與後方的建設打成一片；則過去投資西南的種種病症，遲早當可漸漸的消滅掉了。有許多人只知道苛責資本家們的酖於逸樂，置國難於腦後；他們却沒有明瞭，這是各種客觀勢力所凑集的結果，只有把客觀條件糾正過來之後，問題才有解决的可能。</p>
<h3>環境的變遷</h3>
<p>— 胡承武</p>
<p>過去二年間，中國政府努力獎勵投資西南，資本家也頗多親往內地，凖備開發；但是政府所提倡的是一種希望或一種理想；資本家所追求的却是巨額的利潤或資本的增殖，兩方目標不一致，幷且無法使之一致，因此過去的開發西南，只成爲口號，不能說有什麼效果。</p>
<p>雖然，中國現在的政治經濟機構依然不允許國家本身作爲各種產業的主人，也不能管理或命令資本家的一切財產或生產工具，但是國家却有統制的權力，同時也可以在各方面佈置環境，使其適合資本家的生產條件；最近政府顯然努力於這種工作，幷且已經表現相當的成績。</p>
<p>我們知道，開發西南幷不是單純的資金內流問題，這裹包括着許多生產手段遷移的問題。因爲單純資金的內流，而在內地不能任意購得生產手段，依然是無法從事於開發的；况且內地如其單是缺乏資金，政府銀行頗可製造信用，予以通融，大可不必仰給上海或香港等地的資金：所以從開發西南的立塲所提出的資金內移問題，實在需要註釋，就是資金必須以生產手段的形態內移。</p>
<p>這種內移問題，過去會經發生許多困難，遭受極大波折，但是最近環境轉變，許多困難已經克服，此後資金與生產手段的內移當然可以較前順利。</p>
<p>所謂環境的轉變是二方面的：一方面是上海香港等地景氣的衰落，另一方面是內地產業環境的改良。</p>
<p>先從第一方面說：上海市塲自從法幣匯價下落以後，百物飛漲，依普通的景氣原理說，工業必將受刺激而發逮；但是上海已爲孤島，與淪陷區經濟的交流幷不密切，在中國的許多產業家立塲而言，他們的民族意識不許其與淪陷區溝通經濟關係；而在日本產業家的立塲說，也雅不願中國資本分其禁臠，所以上海的繁榮，就只靠上海本身的消費費；匯價下落以後，一般購買力减低，上海的生產力失去其大批的支持力量，所以就被迫减工或停歇；其中允以外國產品爲原料的紡織廠或麵粉廠，遭受的打擊更大；許多資本旣不能在產業上獲得利潤，自然成爲遊資，浮浪市上，於是投機之風極爲盛旺，居奇囤積層出不窮。然而投機猶如賭博，一方如博得厚利，他方必致大受損失，個人的財產容或大有變動，但全體資小決不增加，所以道幷不是正當的營利途徑，不能持久的；幸而現在尙有一種途徑，是為這些遊資的出路，幷且前途是極有希望的，這就是開發西南；所以自從匯價下落以後，投資西南又成爲上海產業家的主要話題。</p>
<p>至於香港方面的環境，也和上海是異曲同工的。自從去年廣州失陷，香港與中國內地的連絡動脈，被日本所切斷，因之香港的終濟情形也和淪陷後的上海類似，主要的是靠着避難人民的消費來維持其生產與貿易，同時牠又利用其與西南各地接近的地位，供給內地日用工業產品，然而自從法幣滙價下落以後，中國避難人民漸覺生活的困難，紛紛遷往內地；而香港工業也因所產商品，折合法幣以後，價格高昂，無法推銷內地，不得不停止工作。加之，最近歐局緊張，大戰時有爆發的可能性，如其戰事果眞發生，則英國鞭長莫及，恐不能顧及香港的安全；而日軍適在此進佔領深圳，威脅九龍，且揚言對鎖香港，因之香港工業在經濟上及軍事上均有遷地爲良的必要，而他們唯一的出路就是內地。所以最近香港的資金與生產手段移往內地頗爲盛旺，據云香港匯豐銀行在八月二十日至二十六日一週間，被提的存款共　二千萬元之多，因而不得不限制提存，以資維持；這種事實就是資金內流的明證，無疑的對於西南的開發有極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>再就內地的產　環境而言，前年政府初遷內地，雖以開發西南為主要政綱，但是因為政務多端，無暇立刻樹立祥細的計劃，因之未見效果；但是經過這兩年的慘澹經營，各地的資源物產，已獲精細的調查，開發的計劃及方針，也得具體的定案，經濟部長翁文灝曾發表論文，規定國有產業與民間產業的分野，凡是充實內地人民生活及加强國家抗戰力量的一切產業，政府決不與民爭利；並擬竭力扶掖獎勵，藉以克服內地的各種不利條件。同時因爲發展運輸是生產手段內移的先決條件，所以交通部開發交通路綫，不遺餘力。滇緬公路的完成，滇緬鐵路的興築，滇越鐵路的充實及湘桂。桂越二鐵路的銜接等都是短時期內的最高成績，最近西南運輸公司已有戰軍汽車兩千輛，且招聘拔師六百人，大規模的訓練運輸方面的技術人員，所以此後運輸能力一定大有可能觀，雖然欲幾此解決一切運輸問題，尙覺言之過早，但在建設西南工業的過程中，已可克服前此的許多困難。此外財政部獎勵資金內移限制淪陷區匯兌，及訓令中央信託局辦理全部兵險等，都足以保證內地產業的資金與安全，對於產業內移也是一種極好的促進劑。所以從政府的各方面設施看來，現在內地的產業環境已經大見改良，與從前的確有天壤之別。</p>
<p>兩方面環境的改變，巴經造成一種新的形勢，就是資金或產業的內移，成爲上海香港等地民挨資本的唯一出路，他們非但直接的可以藉此獲得巨額的利潤，幷且間接的還可以貢獻於國家經濟基礎的建設，所以除了毫無國家意識或眼光淺短的人以外，沒有產業家或資本家會發生躊路的。</p>
<h3>國家應如何努力</h3>
<p>— 史亦聞</p>
<p>就過去西現建設實情來看，有頗足稱道的地方。雖然離開實際需要和理想的目標尙遠，但在短促時期中，已有不少的戰時工業建立起來，尤其是交通建設一項，有驚人的成績。不過，我們認爲遺憾的，居着中國中心地位的上海，對於這一偉大事業，却參加得非常少。我們並不吾認，國軍西撤之後，上海的工業絡續遷往內地的也不少，但就其比數（內遷的與遺留在上海的）來看，却是微乎其微的。</p>
<p>何以上海的工業遷移到內地去的這樣少，當然不是上海的工業家愛國後人，面且有其　觀原因的。</p>
<p>第一·因爲內地交通不便，要將笨重機件運入，事賽上有很多困難。</p>
<p>第二·對內地情形不熟悉，生活亦不慣。</p>
<p>第三·遷移費用浩大，非普通工業資力所能負擔，政府父無具體補助鑄法。</p>
<p>第四·工業有彼此連帶關係，如甲工業不能遷移，乙工業也祇得採取隨從主義。</p>
<p>第五·許多工業原料，在內地不易獲得：某種工業品，在內地無法銷售。</p>
<p>第六·內地有轟炸危險，不如上海安全。</p>
<p>以上諸因，確是上海工業內遷困難所在。不過，我們要在這裹指出的：這還非最基本的原因，最基本的原因是：「在上海有厚利可圖」惟其在上海有厚利可圖，因此一般工業家即使明白自己的事業應該內遷，結果終被「厚利」誘住，而留戀不去了。資本向有利方面流動，是資本主義經濟的鐵則，民族意識是敵不過牠的</p>
<p>上海工業留戀在上海，要是僅僅影響到西南經濟建設，並無害於國族前途的話，則還不是怎樣值得注意的事。但事實不然。因為：</p>
<p>第一·上海工業的發達，就有不少的資金及大批工業技術人員被吸住，明顯的是對西南經濟建設一種阻碍。</p>
<p>第二·因為上海對內地交通不便，所以上海對內地物資的供應，事實已很有少有貢獻的可能。相反的，由於：</p>
<p>第三·對淪陷區地域上的接近，和淪陷區發生了較內地更爲密切的經濟交流關係：因此益使上海對內地經濟日趨疏隔，而成某方政策的支持者。</p>
<p>第四·由於上海工業的發達，致有大量外貨的輸入，造成對外貿易的巨額入超，使法幣擔負重大的搔失，削弱中國的經濟力，並危害中國整個的金融機搆。</p>
<p>因此，我們認為上海的工業發展，不僅間接上阻止西南經濟建設的發展，直接上更危害着中國的整僩戰時經濟組織，給中國以絕大的威脅。</p>
<p>但如何使上海的工業內遷呢？單　文字上的鼓吹，或設定補助，保險等獎勵法來勸誘，不會收得切實效果的：因爲工業家旣「在上海有厚利可圖一所以不會，自動到內地去的。</p>
<p>然則造成先前上海工業家有厚利可圖的基本事實，無疑的是政府不惜重大犧牲，維持外滙暗市，與上海市面的結果。對於這極政策，亟應重行考慮！</p>
<p>雖然，在六月七日以來，政府的政策，已有多少改變，但還不夠澈底，雖然目前上海，已不若往日繁榮，但還有血吸，還有機投；當然：對於上海市塲實施反繁榮的政策，也許受到外交方面和政治方面的許多牽制，但如果見毒而怕開刀，是會貽害全身的。置之死地而後生，這是處置麻木不仁者唯一有效的辦法吧？</p>

<p>現金赤烚暗盤，昨日因値星期一例假、致無正式行市據聞前日（九日）午後、因投機多頭、鑒於金價連跌二天、趁週六下午外匯例假機會、至傍晚竟無中生有、濫放空氣、謂週一外匯又將發生變動、且傳中政府對於外匯將聽其自止伸縮等說、同時將價猛烈抬高、至四千元關口、大同行飾金掛至四百元、新同行三百九十八元、但因同一般經營者、對於上項消息、均不置信、故趁高紛來吐塞、價遂下疲、午刻錢兌業門市收進價爲三千八百八十元、賣似則討三千九百二十元、較上日非正式價回落百元光景矣、</p>

<h3>糖市　食糖騰漲</h3>
<p>糖市自歐戰發動以來、因來源發生問題、連日激漲不已、不特業內人咸爲注目、即業外人亦有兼營、於是食糖買賣、頗有投機化之感、昨日公會劃盤、騰漲愈烈、升度竟達六七元之多二四粗白本棧初爲六十一元、後升至六十三元三角、外棧六十元二角至六十三元、轉口五十元、太古車白B嘜由六十五元直達七十元、餘嘜照退H嘜軍赤五十二元半、荷赤現貨五十二元至五十四元、轉口四十四元、本綿白振記一號六十三元、本號冰七十元、晶明冰七十一元半、國糖刁靑亦暴騰五元許、開至四十元、（現鈔）成交四百包、</p>

<h3>日偽警在越界築路　昨續佔房屋兩處　極司非而路偽警設分所　租界巡捕繼續執行職務</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路區域、如極司非而路愚園路等處、近日來日軍僞警時有往來、惟該處租界崗捕仍照常執行公務、故租界警權如常、自前日僞警擅自駐入慈聯三十一收容所後、昨日續有數處、如靜安寺路地豐路附近某銀行職員宿舍亦有僞警前往、意圖借駐、租界當局對於滬西最近情勢、頗加注視、茲將各情、分誌如次、</p>
<p>租界當局相機戒備</p>
<p>連日滬西情勢、因日僞軍行動頻繁、居民未明原因、不免多所臆測、以致頓現不安情狀、日僞軍方面、又多未得各該屋主同意、逕行入駐、昨悉兩租界方面、以「九一八」轉瞬即屆、爲保障界內之秩序與安寗計、即於昨日起開始特別戒備、各要道口、均增派警探駐守、而於毗連滬西華界處所、尤予密切防衛、兩租界內此項戒備、將俟「九一八」後、始行撤銷、至對於滬西越界區域之戒備、聞將視情勢上之需耍程度、隨時作適應之措置、</p>
<p>另據大中社記者於昨日下午往滬西一帶實地視察、詳情如下、</p>
<p>日人參觀難童中學</p>
<p>前日下午四時、日偽軍侵入越界築路極司非而路上一號慈聯分會第三十一難民收容所後、將極司非而路各里弄司閣捕、盡行驅逐、英防軍司令部聞報、即派軍一隊、在收容所對面、施行警戒、英軍旎奉命撤退、形勢遂吿和緩、入晚、日僞軍即撤退其大部、僅留守十餘人、於十時後、突有日軍官兩人、入收容所內之難童中學、名爲參覜、當由學校方面職員陪同其巡視校內一週、該兩日軍官曾詢該校由何人主辦、學生來源、職員即說明係各慈善機關主辦、學生係各收容所保送之難童、又詢學生旣係難童、服裝何致如此整齊、職員吿以係各慈善機關贈送、兩日軍官始無辭而退、</p>
<p>昨晨改築堅固工事</p>
<p>迨至昨晨、日偽軍又增三十餘人、並在門前原有堆築之臨時防禦工事、拆卸改裝、本係築於當門者、現移築於門之兩旁、想爲便於汽車出入、改建時、由日軍官在塲監工、似較前者爲堅固、可見其似無撤退之意、</p>
<p>兩處房屋續被侵入</p>
<p>昨晨復繼續被日僞軍侵佔者、有（一）極司非而路十五號秋園及茂生康記木行（在收容所西隔壁）在該處設僞警派出所、（二）靜安寺路一千七百六十號（地豐路附近）某銀行職員宿舍、該處有職員四十餘人居住、昨晨八時許、突有僞警四五人、至該屋門首貼一佈吿、大意命該行職員迅速離去、俾供作辦事處、至八時三刻、僞警及日憲兵十餘名、又至該處、並要接收宿舍全部、宿舍門口、並派武裝日憲兵四名、荷槍實彈、在門口駐守、一部僞警及日憲兵即入內搜查、當時門口並停有該行接送職員客車二輛、幸得僞警示意、司機者會意、即避向靜安寺方面駛去、致未被扣留、該處職員見狀、即向僞警等交涉良久、毫無效果、職員等遂準備遷出、現門口雖有日軍駐守、職員出入、尙屬自由、</p>
<p>要點多處日偽駐守</p>
<p>此外記者見愚園路四明別墅及中實新村兩處弄口、均已有僞警七八人荷槍駐守、聞於每日下午八時起、即禁止居民出入、又四明別墅西首越界築路開納路口、亦駐有日僞軍十餘名、聞愚園路各里弄司閣捕、昨日起亦已被逐、極司非而路康家橋附近、亦已有僞警佈崗、至此、可謂滬西越界築路之要點、截至昨日、已盡爲日軍控制、極司非而路滬西日憲兵司令部門首及僞警署門首、昨日起、均已建築防禦工事矣、</p>
<p>滬西崗捕照常供職</p>
<p>極司非而路至曹家渡、在以往本由靜安寺路捕房時派警備車載探捕時往巡邏、每日在五角塲一帶、本可見彼等院跡、自昨日起、已悄然無綜、當記者經過靜安寺路捕房時、則見專司該處巡邏任務之警備車三輛、停於愚園路郵政局附近、惟滬西一帶、原有崗位巡捕</p>
<p>昨日仍照常駐在、執行職務、對來往行人車輛、亦未見日僞警干涉、他如哥倫比亞路·安和寺路·一帶、記者雖未見有大隊日僞軍駐在、但據居民言、日僞軍每日不分晝夜、開往巡邏、人數七八人·十餘人不等、尙無其他動靜、</p>
<p>又英文大美晚報云、當本埠人士集中注意力於波蘭發展之戰報時、日人謀</p>
<p>控制上海</p>
<p>今（十日）晨更進一步、卡車若干輛、載武裝大道警察與日憲兵、增援昨日（九日）進據極司非而區各派出所之大道警察、若輩均備步槍、到達新派出所後、持槍上槍刺待令、極司非而路兩派出所中、</p>
<p>戎裝持槍之大道警察雲集、另一派出所則滿駐日憲兵、大道驚察並駐凱納路與康腦晚路各派出所、但尙無接收其他久爭的界外馬路、如愚園路·白利南路·大西路·及凱旋路之行動、查該區爲英軍防區之一部份、公共租界巡捕繼續在該區巡邏、</p>
<p>昨晨英兵曾往察勘</p>
<p>又訊、侵人滬西越界築路地帶之「大道」僞警、迄尙未有撤離之意、是故當地所由造成之緊張局勢、依然存在、地豐路附近之英兵房、曾於昨日淸晨七時三十分左右、派出載有英兵之卡車二輛、駛往被僞警部份佔據之極司非而路慈聯第卅一收容所前實地察勘、但在英軍抵達該處以後、駐在附近之日本憲兵隊、亦即派遺日兵一隊、趕往卅一收容所、以爲僞警奧援、故英兵勾留不久、即又原車駛回、</p>
<h3>交戰國在滬僑民　保持冷靜頭腦　羣謀調整情感應付危局　兩年前滬戰曾患難相共</h3>
<p>上海泰唔士報云、上海爲一國際性都市、各國人民俱有、外僑之需要抑制情感及冷靜思想者、從未有如已往七日之甚者、蓋一週前英法相繼宣佈對德國有戰爭狀態之存在、而二十五年前世界大戰爆發時之情緒、自然隨之復發也、惟數日以來、交戰各國之僑民、已得論斷、即互相敵對行動、實無裨益是、本市各國僑民、自上星期日起、已一再表示縱於最危急時亦具有保持冷靜頭腦之能力、英法波三國對德作戰、至今日（十日）已屆一週、更有若干國家卒將捲入戰爭漩渦、未可逆料、惟僑居本市之四大交戰國國民甚衆、彼等迫不得已而留居此間、其中許多人切欲投入本國軍隊、服志願軍役但已能離滬服現役者、寥寥無幾也、回憶已往一週中、交戰國在滬僑民間僅發生一次不幸事端、實堪驚奇、據久居上海之某外僑稱、上海對於粉擾、已成習慣、而其市民亦已經歷許多政治激變與危險、故較世上其他都市之市民更能調整彼等之情感、以應付危局云、今在交戰各國之僑民、會於兩年前滬戰時駢肩防衛在滬之相互利益、縱歐洲諸國政府交惡、而此種具有特性之維繫與情感、不易忘也、已往一週中、滬上英·法·波·德·四國僑民、不得不重行調整</p>
<p>彼等之關係、服軍役年齡之英僑、自願爲國服役、英當局則囑彼然留滬繼續商務、至需要時、加以召集、法僑後備兵、已經召集、將隨時啟程返國、德當局已訓示德僑將來從事何種職務、波僑亦已接得訓令、更有其他國籍之壯丁多人願爲英法政府效勞、但當局亦勸彼等靜待發展、就大體言、上海於以往一週內、除商業益受限制、及有潛伏之焦慮外、對於歐洲之悲慘發展、頗少顯著之反響、下週與日後情况如何、乃上海一般外僑將鎭靜堅定以待者也、</p>
<h3>貨主操縱居奇　外貨狂漲　五金顏料存底充實　紙價飛騰影響文化</h3>
<p>中日戰爭後、歐美各國進口貨物、因外匯變動、本已上漲甚多、自德波開戰後、給予滬上物價之刺激允深、於是滬上各項舶來品、旬日間更呈不規則之在漲、實則歐戰並未擴張、地中海與遠東間之航運、並未中斷、其最大原因、實由擁有貨物者之囤積居奇故意操縱、致市價瞬息萬變、在漲不已、按之實際、滬上如五金·顏料·呢絨等貨物存底、頗爲充實、因貨主之不肯脫手、以待善價、致形成目前之現象、據五金業消息、五金中若干貨品、一星期內又繼續上漲倍許、如百磅洋釘、每桶目前已漲至六十元外、甚至高喊七十八十元、在德波未戰前、固僅每桶三十元左右、此外顏料亦然、而日來紙價昂漲、亦殊勁人、據昨日市價報紙每令巳漲至二十六元、道林紙每磅漲至六角、且有繼續看漲趨勢、紙價漲風之猛、對於文化敎育界之影饗、實甚重大、</p>
<h3>意郵求利起柴　定期駛歐</h3>
<p>意國郵船公司歐亞航綫、上月二十八日應來上海之康鐵凡特號班、改由行駛北菲綫之求利起柴號來滬、該輪抵埠後、適因歐洲發生戰事、遂在滬停留待命、日前該國政府表明態度後、該輪即奉總行電令返歐、滬行即辦理裝貨發售客票等手續、因由滬赴歐船隻缺乏、以致客貨擁塞、該輪爲歐局惡化後之第一艘船赴歐、故貨物異常擁擠、一切手續不易辦妥、乃再延期、現悉決定於十四日晨、起椗出口、旅客須十三日晚登輪、該公司預備之接客小輪、末决爲十三日晚八時、自新關碼頭開往、</p>
<h3>財部鞏固法幣　滬市金融大定　外滙趨穩定債價格上升　各界移貨資內地開發實業</h3>

<h3>江南流動部隊　活躍京滬沿綫　蘇常交界偽軍納降　公路涵洞徹夜挖開</h3>
<p>江南流動隊最高當局、自决定第×路軍東進後、爲時已歷數月、屢歷艱險、其先頭部隊頃始由日軍防地內進展至靑浦。瀏河·羅店·吳淞江·一帶、在上列諸地、均與日軍有遭遇戰、允以羅店·吳淞江·二役爲最、第×支隊先鋒隊迫近於維店時、已爲日諜所探悉、乃奔吿日軍部、日軍乃派軍二百餘、將該先頭部隊包圍、雙方即行開火、幸華方後隊趕到、日軍被迫、四散竄逃、是役共擊斃日軍八十餘、獲長槍五十餘枝、激戰達三小時、據參加當時戰鬥之某連長談、羅店一役、爲東進以來最激烈之戰鬥、當時形勢危急、已達極點、非步槍威力所能及、即素負衝鋒陷陣之利器機關槍、亦棄之不用、乃均運用手溜彈、可見當時戰鬥之烈、聞上月二十八日、日軍雇有汽船一艘、拖帶民船七艘、在吳淞江虞姬墩附近、鼓浪上駛、當行抵某處時、被岸上流動部隊、打沉民船兩艘、日軍亦死五十餘人、而日軍始終未曾還擊、倉皇遁去、近來遊擊戰事、滬郊極爲普遍、祇以日方傷亡人數、秘而不宣、消息遲滯、故外間鮮有知其詳者、</p>
<p>無錫西郊偽軍解決</p>
<p>據蘇州來人談、在蘇錫常三縣之江南流動部隊、於本月叫日淸晨、由第×路軍第×支隊一部二百餘人、進襲無錫西門外七里之某處偽軍顧福興部據點、在二十分鐘內、即全被解决、計僞軍死二十餘名、大隊長樊某亦當塲被擊斃、生擒三十餘名、繳得短槍二十餘枝、步槍三十餘校、因該處離城頗近、城中日軍聞警、急派大隊前往應援、待馳抵目的地、流動部隊早已引去、</p>
<p>蘇常交界華軍大捷</p>
<p>日僞軍爲報復計、乃不惜調動大軍、計出動日軍二百隊、僞軍五百餘、而以偽軍爲前鋒、並携有重兵器小鋼砲等、雇用汽艇拖帶民船五艘、向前推進、迫抵達蘇常交界處之葦涇塘、捨舟登陸時、爲×路軍步哨所見、急返隊報吿、乃派素有戰鬥經騐之×支隊三百餘人、前往堵截、乘共尙未完全登陸、將其包圍、並高呼「放下槍械是自己人」、日僞猝不及防、難於應付、結果巳登陸之偽軍三百餘人、全部納降、日軍見形勢不佳、即開足馬力、開放小鋼砲、邊逃邊放、是役未傷一兵、未死一卒、竟獲絕大之勝利、並獲得重機關槍二挺、輕機關槍五挺、步槍二百十六枝、手槍十餘支、子彈七箱、投降之偽軍三百餘人、自願從軍者、均調赴後方、從事訓練、不願從軍者、登記姓名、每名發給川資五元、</p>
<p>涵洞被塞激怒農民</p>
<p>日軍因葦涇塘一役、損失鉅大、無法消恨、乃改變方針、作斧底抽薪之法、因水路多橋樑、流動部隊易於伏藏、乃將蘇常公路一百餘里之所有橋洞、完全塞沒、但農民灌溉、全賴橋洞引水、今一且被日僞軍完全塞沒、則無異斷絕農民之生計、憤怒之下、遂相率走吿於江南流動隊指揮部、要求從速救濟、以蘇民困、指揮部最高當局、召集政訓人員、於晚間全體出動、號召及自動參加之農民計一千餘人、徹夜工作、將被日軍塞斷之橋洞、全數挖開、並將橋樑路而完全破壞、交通因之斷絕、聞至最近、方始修復</p>
<p>福山白渡均有接觸</p>
<p>流動部隊自此役完成後、爲一勞永逸計、乃沿蘇常公路、實行搜索、詎行至徐墅時、又與調回常熟之日軍遭遇、雙方乃立即開火、激戰一時許、生擒日軍四十餘人、獲輕機關槍一挺、長槍五十餘枝、常屬之福山、蘇屬之白渡、邇來均有接觸、日軍大有應接不暇之勢、蓋淪陷區日兵單薄、無法調遣、業已計窮力竭、</p>

<p>罷工理由</p>
<p>該廠在「一二八」後、曾以原料飛漲爲詞、將男工房飯金、每人减去三元、幷將女工論件工資、亦减去二成半、最近工人方面、以際此米珠薪桂、要求廠方體恤工人生活艱難、仍請恢復原有制度、同時要求發給所有民二十六二十七兩年花紅、及戰前購之大批廉價白米（廠方凖備在非常時期以作救濟工人之用）茲米價一再飛漲、在外購　不易、因此亦請求廠方早日作價平　、售與工人、爰於木月五日、由全體工人推出胡雲生·薛繼忠·沈子鈞·陳子仁·黃玉森·唐紀全·薛金德等七人爲代表、向經理吳哲生廠長黃伯勤請願、因延而未決、至八日工人方面乃決議全體怠工數小時</p>

<p>交通與運輸</p>
<h3>昌興公司概况（下）</h3>
<p>— 鄧炳銓譯　波蒙氏（H.Ｂ.Beaumont）原著</p>
<p>許多年來，歐陸各國（英法德意荷蘭和葡萄牙），在東方重要城市所設商行，經營貿易，獲有相當的基礎。因爲貿易的關係，道經蘇彝士運河的歐亞交通，有蓬勃繁榮的趨勢；而英國和紐西倫，澳大利，亞洲間取道彝士運河的航運，也非常發展。本公司在當時發售太平洋大西洋和加拿大的舟車聯票，遇有旅客不欲於回程循原道經加拿大者，我們便以環遊世界旅行的途徑，售給取道蘇彝士運河和加拿大的船票。</p>
<p>到夏威夷東方和澳洲各地去觀光的游侶，人數異常擁擠，這給予本公司一個絕好的發展機會。在一九三八年中，加拿大，夏威夷和澳洲間的客運，有增加的表現。以言東方，因爲情勢逈異，客運未免遜色。但在承平時代，東方保有沉靜的氛圍，優越的環境，和在匯兌上的便宜，給予每個游侶在其他任何地方不易　得的優遇。</p>
<p>游侶的動向，有單獨旅行的，亦有集團游行的。集團游行的組織，每隊有領隊一人，掌管其事。本公司在業務需要上，和其他各輪船公司訂有廣泛的聯絡，故能給予顧客在路程上自由的伸縮，——旅行途中在任何地方可以隨意作長久或暫時的停留。本公司訂有三種不同的票價，適應各個游客的經濟能力。</p>
<p>其次要的，是商業交通，因爲貨運和商業交通互相連繫；所以這是很具價値的。在外國服務的傳敎士，每隔若干時日，便須返國，新傳敎士奉派往外國，或是替代舊傳敎士，或則加派到外國去，這種客運，本公司佔其大部份，所以其他輪船公司競爭得很利害。</p>
<p>本公司在亞洲的客運業務，很多在火奴魯魯與東方間的中國人日本人和菲列濱人搭客，例如中日人得合法准許而永久居住在加拿大與美國；或回中國日本一行而復返。中國學生，也得暫時的許可，赴加拿大和美國，入專校肄業，叉來往東方哈佛那西印度羣島和南美洲各地間的中國人，這種客運，爲數殊衆，本公司除載他們橫渡太平洋外，橫貫大陸的鐵路業務，也因此增加。</p>
<p>本公司在太平洋業務收人的另一個來源，便是我們所調的轉口交通。太平洋航行旅客的目的地，沿本公司輪船航行所經各口岸的路綫，由第一埠至第二埠的旅客，較遠行的旅客爲多，這種客運由本公司辦理的，有很大的數字。</p>
<p>本公司在太平洋的航綫，遠至孟尼刺爲止，但訂有聯運辦法，因此可以直接發售至星加坡，樓榔嶼，哥倫布，孟買，仰光，加爾客答等地的船票。至於加拿大，澳洲輪船公司，亦有同樣的聯運辦法，發售至南菲洲實萍（Durbin）和角城（Caqe　Town等地的船票。</p>
<p>在太平洋上的循環旅行，（Circuit　Torus）本公司訂有各種特別的票價，旅客可以由加拿大乘本公司著名的皇后號輪出發至東方，再由東方擇乘任何公司輪船至澳洲；然後乘加拿大澳洲輪船公司的船隻，遄返加拿大。</p>
<p>爲謀便利往來舊金山落山磯兩埠和東方間的行旅起見，本公司與美國總統輪船公司和麥遜輪船公司（Matson　Line）訂有合作的辦法，例如在上述兩埠和火奴魯魯間可以選乘總統公司或麥遜公司的輪船，自火奴魯魯間的旅行，則由本公司輪船承載。如是，旅客方面可以省却舊金山和落山磯與加拿大溫哥華間的車費和時間，且感到無限的便利。</p>
<p>再說本公司輪船票價釐訂的問題，因爲各種輪船的形式，噸位，和航行的路綫等等，有很大的差別，所以最初必須依照獨自的基礎而訂價格。經過許多年來的經騐，按照各公司競爭和輪船本身造價爲根據，而調整其定價，以至現時所定的水準價格。凡是現行的票價有須更改者，都須經過太平洋客務聯合會辦理，仟何輪船公司擬添置新輪，或有輪船未曾在太平洋上行駛過而加入的，規定價格的條件，須先將該輪的容量形式，票價等等，詳細報吿聯合會的會員，然後由該會的票價委員會舉行會議，研究所定價格，並向聯合會報吿，貢獻意見。總之，每家會員輪船公司的定價，都是按照輪船的年齡，噸位，和速率的等級而規定的。假如和本公司競爭的輪船公司定價較低，實在是因爲聯合會規定的等級較低的原故，反之，本公司的定價，如較其他公司爲低時，其原因也是一樣的。</p>
<p>把這個太平洋客運事業的概况總括起來說，就可以想像到我們大公司裏的輪船，猶之海外的使節一般，反映出世界上最大旅行機構在外國的效率；促進加拿大在七大洋間的貿易，用各種不同的語言，在各種族間，宣揚本公司和加拿大的名字及聲譽及於全球。</p>
<p>本公司的榮譽，原係出自全體同人，對此重要的航海工具，認識愈深，那末這光榮的累積亦愈甚。這些航海巨舶不斷的經濟上的成功，也都出自各個人的興趣和責任。我希望每一個職員，不問他的地位或職責如何，大家出以合作的行動，來增進我們航海企業的成功。</p>
<p>譯者按—昌興公司（TheCanadian　Pacific）爲世界最大之旅行機關，其業務之繁，交通工具之廣，舉世殆無其匹，營業範圍，達於太平洋，大西洋，各大湖與英屬哥侖比亞沿岸（British　Clonmbia　Coast）以及其他湖沼及各大河問，有鉅輪七十五艘，其總噸位的達五十萬。</p>
<p>當一八八一年，有遠見之士數人，以司蒂芬先生（George　Stephen）爲其領袖，此人即爲加拿大太平洋鐵路公司之首任總經理，獲有特權，於十年內完成至太平洋沿岸之鐵路。及至一八八六年，加拿大太平洋公司之首次火車，遂橫過大陸，直達太平洋之濱。以上所述，爲加拿大太平洋鐵路公司之濫觴。</p>
<p>同年該公司獲得允許，行駛快船“W．B．Flint”號，因業務需要，經請求結果，更添船三艘，專載客貨運輸，自溫古華直航遠東。四年以後，更開定期班，辦理聯太平洋之業務，以著名之皇后船行駛，即「中國皇后」，「日本皇后」，及「印度皇后」諸船是也。</p>
<p>最顯著者，爲現在之遠東航務，有日本皇后號，加拿大皇后號，亞細亞皇后號以及俄羅斯皇后號等船，每兩星期間開行一决，行駛於小呂宋，香港，上海，日本，檀香山，維多利亞以及溫哥華各大口岸。</p>
<p>上述諸輪，均特別建造，供此需要航行於各處。故著名之白色皇后輪船，爲遠東與北美合衆國最迅捷之航程。</p>
<p>日本皇后號，爲太平洋諸輪之冠，乃聯太平業務中之最快最鉅者。</p>
<p>對於中國交通，允特別注意，每船雇用華員，在五百人以上，非特舫行上海香港間旅客感受便利，即自遠東以至北美間之中國旅客亦然。</p>
<p>該公司在加拿大尙擁有長二萬一千哩之鐵道，聯絡遊歷，工，商，農業要區。火車設備，均屬最新式者，且有流綫式，及冷氣配置之車輛。</p>
<p>車中飯食，烹煮得宜，素爲該公司所重視。</p>
<p>在加拿大各大城市及消夏處，該公司設有旅館十七處，在落磯山中及安達利奧（Ontario），有木屋營九處，服務週到，無與比擬。</p>
<p>在大西洋上，該公司有最鉅最速之郵船，在加拿大與央國間行駛，中有鉅大皇后號一艘，公爵夫人號四艘，「蒙脫」號三艘，及「皮佛」號五艘。</p>
<p>其最大者爲不列巔號，噸位爲四二三五〇，設備超衆，地位寬暢，爲世界任何客船之冠。速率爲每小時二十四海里，橫渡大西洋祇須五日，船身長七六〇呎，寬九七·五呎。有戶外及戶內游泳池各一，亦爲特具之優點，且有正式網球塲，裝置完備之健身房。空氣之全部調換，每小時可有十五次。</p>
<p>行駛太平洋之皇后號輪與樅越加拿大之富麗火車聯絡，再與行駛大西洋之郵船相接。自遠東至西歐之旅客，乘該公司之輪船火車，沿路均予以無上之招待。</p>
<p>該公司尙有廣大之電報網，電報綫長二五〇，〇〇〇哩，及海底電錢三二五哩，通逮加拿大及世界各地；其無錢電台，亦與加拿大其他電台網密切聯絡。</p>
<p>英屬哥侖比亞與西雅圖，Seattle維多利亞，Victoria溫古華，Vancouver阿拉斯加，Alaska及其他西北岸要城，有公主號輪十叫艘往來其間大湖及Port　Mcuicoll　Sault　St　Marie　Port　Arlbur及Fort　wiliaum間，亦有三輪載客運貨</p>
<p>昌興公司海，陸，空，交通綫，長達三寓二千哩。國內外總分公司，多至八千處。發售旅行支票，隨地兌現，便利莫比。（全文完）</p>
<h3>旅美嚮導</h3>
<p>— 詢</p>
<p>（三）住　在美國找房子不是很容易的事。有些人未見過中國人，受電影畫報的影響，不放租給，但是租過第一次以後見中國學生不胡鬧，不欠租，以後便想多找中國人住。在另一方面，有些地方中國學生多，人品不齊，有人作出些醜事，以後旁人也難得找房子，可見個人的舉止，是非常重要的</p>
<p>在美平常的宿舍，民房，靑年會，萬國公寓，旅館等久住的地方，多半祇一單間房。每間普通住一人兩人至三人，一人單間比較貴些，多半的房子除傢具舖蓋以外，供給被單，床單，枕套，毛巾，浴巾，每星期換一兩次，有些地方不供給毛巾。房子平常每天淸理一次，房租平常以星期計算，有時須簽定合同最少住一學期</p>
<p>找尋房子當然看各人的選擇，但有幾點須要注意，冬日的煖汽或熱空氣設備與熱水當然最要緊。靠近鐵路公路太吵鬧，最高一層如無屋頂空屋夏天恐太熱。其餘如窗戶方向，以及房間大小，也有考慮的必要。至於宿舍等類地方，其設備較佳，所應考慮的問題，便少得多。我國同學常好大聲談話，有時惹起他人的反響，如果有幾位朋友來，除自己小心以外，最好把房門關起，以免妨礙別人。</p>
<p>（四）行　此間所述者，僅係美國普通城市交通方法，茲將其情形，簡單的紀述一二。</p>
<p>街頭待雇的汽車Taxi，在小城裏多半無論遠近，祇有一樣價錢，在大城便照距離與時間計算。除有指定的停車站外，在街上行駛的空車，亦可以作手勢招來。各大車行都有一定的花紋及顏色，不難一見而知。</p>
<p>電車在美國現已不若公共汽車來得興旺，但是價格便宜，五分或一角就可以從城的一面到另一端，且電車站距離甚短，交又地亦可換車無須另外買票。多數街心電車路旁圈出一塊地方呌作「安全區」，是爲等候電車的人躱避汽車的地方。</p>
<p>公共汽車與電車差不多，但因不受路軌與電綫的限制，所以近年以來，頗有取電車而代之的形勢。有些大城市的公共汽車有露天的上層，坐上去可以瀏覽風景，是別樣車所沒有的。</p>
<p>在紐約波士頓等城多半有地下車，芝加哥有高架車，因爲不在路面上開行，不與汽車，電車，行人等衝突，所以車的速度很大。此種車價也極便宜，較長的路途，允爲合算。大的化五分錢，就可以乘車二十幾英里。</p>
<h3>旅行通問</h3>
<p>答陸水君：（一）由滬出發至贛省上饒縣，以取道寗波爲最便利，乘坐輪船赴甬，最低票價爲五元二角半，由甬經橫漲而至金華，汽車費的十二元餘。抵金華後，即可循浙贛鐵路逕赴上饒，三等火車價目的五元餘。手續方面，則以備有身份證明書，較爲妥便。</p>

<p>我在雲南四川的時候，覺得食物店的生意，側做兩批，實在是個好機會，我們外江人跑去凑他們的空檔，恰恰正好。我想有些地方，大可仿行他們的制度，他們是上午九點吃一頓，九點半開始工作，直到下午四點半以後再吃一頓，中間並不夾着一頓飯的工夫，各人隨意帶些乾點心吃，那是絕對自由，不受强制停工的；所以七小時的工作，實在要比八小時的成績多呢。我們雖是九時上工，實際須在半小時以後，方才能得心應手，上了正軌，正和火車一樣，很調勻的走着；但不過兩個鐘頭，將到十一點半，就要預備停工了。所以午鐘一響，會得和僧徒的手磬一樣，立刻一齊站起身來，大家走散，回去吃飯，免不了有分心的事情，等到下午一點重來上工，亦如野馬受親，硬生生的絆到五點，在那前後半小時中，比到上午還不如呢。所以名呌八小時工作，實際上只不過五小時，最不便的就是中間夾着一頓吃飯工夫，並不是個寫意的休息，而是個强迫的勞動，所以患胃病的多了。遇到盛暑嚴寒，要在烈日之下雨雪之中，硬逼着去奔走，也是冤枉得很。學校中的上課時間，銀行中的辦公時問，如果改了七小時制，實在是很有益的。在此七小時中，每隔兩小時各人隨便休息五分鐘，隨便吃些茶點，就不致於枵腹從公。我們小時候去進考塲，帶着四個嵌胡桃的棗肉，每吃一個，足耐兩小時飢，並不需飲茶水，考據起來，很有益處。足見古老人的經騐，也是合於科學的呢。如在一個辦公處裏，能有半數人，自動商請常局，特許他們試行食時分班制度，移兩半小時到中間來繼續工作，我想七小時的工作，成績一定可觀。若是學校如此，我想這一班的學生成績，定比普通好得多。凡是在外吃飯的朋友，大可特的聚餐，吃食店也好和川滇一樣，多做一批趁空兒的生意，定能特別優待，因爲房金工食是不加分文的呀。</p>
<h3>居住的光明問題</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>居住與光明，是不可分離的，蓋居住的先决條件，光綫問題，也是其中之一。如果你的寓所是間湫溢，幽暗—光綫漆黑的住房，（因爲光錢暗，空氣當然無淸潔之可言），這樣的地方，你願意全眷搬進去嗎？無論碩大無朋的大房子，或是玲瓏可愛的小房子，光綫一暗，住進去，終有些不甚樂意。所以建築住房，第一要求是光綫充足，空氣流通，纔有裨於居住者的健康。健康而後，節省醫藥等費，裨益於家庭經濟，必有可觀，古諺所謂：「窮健過於富貴」，是一些也不婿的。天地自然間的白畫光明，吾人可取之無盡，用之不竭，「一寸光陰一寸金，寸金難買寸光陰，」吾人對於白畫的天然光明，應知如何愛惜，如何寳貴。</p>
<p>至於夜間呢，在有錢的人家，固然明炬耀眼，浪用電費，以求光明的恣意享受。然而有錢的富戶，究極少數，佔大衆圈的許多平民之家，衣食，尙虞不給，遑論欲求夜間光明的恣意享受，而負担鉅數電費的支出呢。本市形成爲孤島之後，百物奇漲，而一夕不可無此君的電燈，那裏省得掉，除非等候回返原始時代，日出而作，日入而息（睡眠也）那樣，才可無需電燈，當此電費再度加增聲中（九月份起公共租界連前須漲百分之一百二十。法租界將漲百分之六十，殊足驚人！）惟有打經濟算盤。筆者是平民階級，不得不用盡腦筋思索省電之法，於是向電器行買來兩隻「錢公偉經濟電燈」，一點之後，非但省電，併且很光明，（該燈是專利品有大小兩電泡。小的是五支燭光，能點一千小時。一隻有小方棚的燈頭，可以用數年之久）我家原來須耗四元錢電費的，上月却减了一半，只付兩元錢的電費了。要謀居室晚上光明而叉要求經濟者，「經濟電燈」是最好的省電利器呢。</p>
<h3>談談番薯</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>上期本刊是「麫食運動專頁」，對於麵食的烹製方法，及有益等等，詳述靡遺，在食米高漲的現在，掉換吃吃，節省經濟不少。筆者再來談談番薯，雖不能和米麵相提並論，但售價較麵粉允廉，在荒歉的地方，儘有充作食糧的，而且煮食甘美香糯，對於老人，小孩都很適宜，我們的早餐和午後點心，正可拿它來服食，也是减低生活費之一法。</p>
<p>按辭源載：「番薯本名甘藷，俗又稱山芋，蔬類植物，莖細長，葉心臟形，皆紫褐色，花似牽牛稍小，塊根橢圓，兩端尖，皮紫肉紅，味甘，北方謂之紅薯以充糧糗。叉一種皮灰色肉白者，味淡，爲番薯之變種。」又按本草載：「陳祈暢異物志云，甘藷出交廣南方民家，以二月種十月收之，其根似芋，剝去紫皮，肌肉正白如肌，南人用當米穀，果食，蒸灸皆香美，（氣味）甘平無毒，（主治）補虛乏，益氣力，健脾胃，强腎陰，功同薯蕷」云云，那末吃番薯不但果腹，還有道許多益處，我對它更發生了好感！</p>
<p>番薯的吃法，也有好幾種；普通的洗凈剝皮煮熟，就好吃了。或者先切成小方塊，煮熟後，和以芡扮，另加桂花糖，那便是番薯　，香甜可口。還有烘番薯是把它洗净後，在炭爐上用一鐵架，這近炭火烘之，待皮色半焦，用指試搯，如已溫軟，便取出剝皮而食，別有風味，惜乎火氣太重，不宜常吃！更可加入素饌中，或用油醬淸炒，佐飯下酒都可以，又將番薯懸於屋簷間，勿受日晒，使它風乾後，剝皮生食，甜美爽口。</p>
<p>不過購買須買大批的可以便宜，最好有同嗜的人，合夥向地貨行批來一担或數担，大家分派自然便宜多了，若各街頭的攤販去買燒熟的番薯那是非但價大，而且恐不十分淸潔，今以符合經濟和衛生的原則起見，特爲說明於此。</p>
<h3>口福與口孽</h3>
<h3>一星期經濟菜菜</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>近來百物飛漲，米已漲到三十多元一擔，所有葷素各菜的價格，也漲到一倍或　倍以上，我這經濟菜單的招脾，已被一拳打破，先前葷素叫樣菜，六七角錢已够，現在却非一元或一元二角不可了。猪肉本來一元可買二多，目前只有一斤，比較的還是牛肉便宜一些，而且維他命也較爲豐富，所以每星期中，不妨間日一吃。可是炒煮牛肉，往往易老不嫩，這裹有一個秘訣，公諸讀者：牛肉切好之後，先用醬油和菱粉拌和，把牛肉浸在裏頭，浸過一小時左右，那磨無論燜啊，燒啊，炒啊都柔嫩而不會老了。牛肉的煮法，種種不同，簡直與猪肉一般複雜，最普通的如咖哩牛肉，芹菜炒牛肉絲，洋葱炒牛肉絲等，較爲別緻些的，那麼黃豆莽紅燒牛肉，乳腐紅燜牛肉，番茄捲心菜馬鈴薯牛肉湯（即俄羅斯式餐館中的羅宋湯）馬鈴薯泥牛肉餅，都是很可口的，要是要節省些米的話，那麼用它們來做麵吃，也無往而不宜，請讀者們自已斟酌吧。</p>

<h3>戰爭狂的希特勒的住</h3>
<p>— 翰</p>
<p>提著希特勒這個名宇，人人腦中會浮現出额上一撮「桃」髮，區區六年中重振德國，現在正在威脅着歐洲的一個怪物吧。照常識的判斷，這樣一個建國動傑，總該住在柏林最精緻的一所洋樓裏。但是，事實恰巧相反，他却住在荒山絕壁之上呢</p>
<p>希氏性喜孤獨，憎棄城市生活。當國社黨初興的時候，他以巴威略（德國南部一邦）的慕尼克爲根據，他目己却躲在亞爾卑斯山麓上的一間小村舍裏，這地方比伯區加藤的市區要高一千五百呎，就在這粗陋的房子裹，他計劃着對德國的民主政治，作種種的攻擊，等他做總裁時，大本營移到柏林，他就把這地方擴展爲伯高市，一變而爲德國有名的「山居村舍」。像回敎的麥加一樣，國社黨員成羣結隊的站在他的木房子外面喊「我們要見非勒「即希氏」！於是道一座「村舍」依舊不能帶淸靜及孤獨給他了。所以在去年上半年，他決定再向亞爾卑斯山的頂上爬。</p>
<p>他看中一塊地方，在亞爾卑斯山格爾斯敦峯峯頂的險坡上。他決定穿入峯底，鑽出峯頂在那人跡不到的地方建造他的「樂園」。工程師和機械師受了他的計劃，工作了好幾僩月，替他造好了一座用鋼鐵玻璃做的「住宅」，不，簡直是鷹窠。只有一條電梯可以相通。接到進口處去的造在山中的，一條路，防範得比英倫銀行的金窖還嚴密。他不希望再有那些「勇敢的山居者」在他別墅叫週的巉巖峭壁上，大喊着「我們要見非勒！」</p>
<p>這些建築在去年九月危機的時候就已造好。但是希氏不希望有很多人知道。他禁止國內報紙刊登這個新聞以及詳細情形，更禁止他最親近的攝影者拍攝照片。</p>
<p>他只要一有機會，他就要到那拔海五千五百呎的別墅裏，從小小的玻璃亭子裹欣賞足底下那些滿蓋着雪的山谷和峯巒。柏林這地方，實在要使他發痴的；因爲他的孤獨的個性極其强固</p>
<p>夏天他趁飛機到慕尼克，冬地則趁他私人的火車，從慕尼克，他的强力的滿賽馳汽車，把他風馳電掣的送到薩爾斯堡，然後再從那條環繞德屬亞爾卑斯山，鑿石爲路的山道上馳到伯區加藤。經過了伯高市村舍，再盤旋五哩就到了。</p>
<p>假如你和他一同去的話，你立刻可看見兩扇極大的古銅大門，常希氏車行近時，它就饅饅的旋開了。車子一直開進格爾斯敦山脚下那大山洞裏去，一直到電梯前面。那山洞是穹廬形的，四週嵌着未磨大理石，長一百三十碼闊的二十呎，並有極大的置汽車的地方，可放許多汽車。至於電梯呢，也是富麗堂皇，鑲着銅綫設着有帷毯的座位，你可和希特勒很舒適的坐着，上升四百呎，達到峯頂。</p>
<p>這個別墅，可容十八個人起居，完全漆成白色，有簡潔的巴威略農夫式的家具，準備羞茶點及希氏愛好的菜食，你如跑近那大窗戶，你一定會暈眩，因爲那小的玻璃事造在絕壁邊上，在這裏可看見四方景物，多山的伯區加藤及四週積雪的亞爾卑斯。</p>
<p>就在這積雪的孤寂的環境裏，希氏決定了一切國家大事及應付方針，掀起了兩三個驚人的巨浪。</p>
<p>有一决某一個英國人，承他陪同參觀，回來之後那個英國人很幽默的，問希特勒說：</p>
<p>「要是那電梯偶或在四百呎中任何地點停滯起來，那怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>「那，我想，」希氏含笑的說，「世界的歷史，只可暫停兩小時了！」</p>

<h3>貧民生活報吿牛糞球</h3>
<p>— （慕徐）</p>
<p>在滬西惇信路潘家庫附近，有一塊廣的二畝的空塲，塲中積潦未涸雜草叢生，這是上海牛奶公司專堆牛糞用的。</p>
<p>上海牛奶公司養有近百頭的荷蘭牛，每天排出的糞量，積如小阜，然而倒在那空塲上不久，就空無所有了。起初我還疑是人家運去充當肥料，繼而叉想，在上海，肥料豈但不値錢，反而要倒貼錢的，倒馬桶就是顯明的例證。</p>
<p>有一回，朝噋初上，玉露未晞，我趁新秋早凉，從那裏經過，只見幾個衣衫襤褸的男婦，和赤膊短褲的兒童，爭先恐後的在牛糞堆裏捧著金黃的牛糞，放進麻籮或煤油箱去，汗珠掛在臉上，也無意去揩拭。過了些時，其中看似父子的兩人，歡喜的滿載而歸。</p>
<p>我要打破這個謎，遠遠的尾隨而行。走到惇信路第一收容所附近的空地上，他們停下牛糞擔來。息了回力，彎下了腰，珍貴似的提著小麻籮裏的牛糞，一個個的做成球形，星羅棋佈的舖在地上。</p>
<p>「這有什麽用途？」我問。</p>
<p>「牛糞球，連同薪草燒火用的。不比煤球差呢！」</p>
<p>「這可以燒火嗎？牠的奧氣，不是熏得連飯菜也不能吃了嗎？」</p>
<p>「把牠晒乾鬆了，便不覺臭，火力很旺呢！」</p>
<p>「你們還製了牠出賣嗎？」我叉問他。</p>
<p>「正是賣的。每　換三米袋的牛糞球，薪炭價格飛漲後，還不够賣呢。眼前某基督堂耍買十元，但是貨色不够，正在趕緊出貨呢！「他得意似的笑著。</p>
<p>「你每天可製牛糞球多少」</p>
<p>「晴天可出貨一元左右，陰天便不能動手了。」</p>
<p>最後，他憑著經騐報吿，燒牛糞球的消耗，還不及燒薪炭的半價呢。據說，滬西這一角落的貧民，靠此爲生的，的有三西十家。牛糞本是廢物，一般在飢餓綫下掙扎的貧民，竟利用了牠，一面代替價値昂貴的薪炭，一面維持最低限度的生活；他們的工作，儘管穢濁與卑微，對於社會與家庭，却有相當的裨補。</p>
<h3>陳柱尊先生法書</h3>
<h3>弄堂小學執教一日記</h3>
<p>— 冷眼</p>
<p>日前接到友人王君的電話，彼因事不能到校，囑往××路××小學代課一日。一則碍於情面，一則橫豎開着無事，答應了下來。於是早一日先由王君介紹該校「經濟校董」——現任三數個弄堂小學校長——相見，决晨興冲冲的偕往學校該校爲三幢三下，校舍全部漆得似廟非廟，黃藍相間，大門外更是大書特書一報名從速」「學費低廉」。入門處有一類似傳達室而實際上爲一學校商店，中坐一十七八歲的孩子，我還以爲是校役，誰知這位校董竟詢以「父親在家嗎？」豈敢！原來是位校長公子呢！</p>
<p>入內逕入樓上廂房，後一半爲敎室，前一小半大的算是校長室；再入內一間就是校長臥室了。時間已快八時半了，校長尙未來辦公，學生倒差不多到齊了。據說上課要到九點鐘呢。我到懊悔來得太時了。這位校董又因事忙先走了，只好坐在校長室中呆待。到九時一刻光景，這位大校長方由臥室中出來接見，接談之下，云待上課時再行通知。</p>
<p>可是奇怪得很，據說是八月二十日就開學的，到現在差不多要到九月中了，連學生的座位還未排定，其未正式上課可知。該校爲一完全小學，敎師也還多，但校長事必躬親，今天竟一級一級的由自已點名自己排班，排班又必須在天井中，於是一級走了再換一級，慢是慢得相當的可以，亂也亂得着實可觀。如此自九時半到十二時方才完竣。早知他要排到十二點鐘我早就走了，承他到這時才來關照下午一時一准上課，不得已只好下午再來。</p>
<p>天曉得！課程表也未排定呢！下午走來第一課又沒我的課，只好坐在樓下應接室而又毘連，敎空的地方坐着參觀敎學。有幾個孩子哭着鬧着不肯來上課，於是由四五位敎師各執寸半厚的戒尺，聲勢凶湧的拖拉入室，鄰室中也是辟辟拍拍的打手心之聲不時傳來，在這個時代猶用體刑，如此敎育，實在呌人寒心，難道這幾位「敎師」連簡易師範敎育的書籍都不曾翻過一翻嗎？</p>
<p>第二課輪到我上課的敎室，恰在校長室之外，於是人來人往，老媽子，小孩子，校長太太，泥水木匠，一槪往來無阻，一小時課上下來，喉頭發癢而且痛，幸而下一課算是放晚學了，這才如大赦般的逃了出來，到外面不覺深深的呼了一口氣。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豓聞忽桃葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>何儷玉道：『如此說來，將來的自由村，要變爲工業區嗎？我以爲在此地吳風淸嘉，最適宜於住居，因此父親要我們在這裹擇地建造住屋。你說住宅區與工業區相近，有什麼妨礙嗎？」朱愛人笑道：「我不過隨便說說，你要考我是不行的呀！所以自由村中人，也常常說限於輕工業，也怕是有種工業，妨害人民的居住呢。現在我們中國新興的有些大工業，動輒占地幾千畝，往往本來是一片荒凉之地，人烟絕跡，自從開闢了這個地方以後，便繁盛了起來。他們的市集，以及地方行政，都靠了這個大工業而成立的，這叉當別論。自由村將來所興的工業，都是些輕工業，小工業，或屬於半手工的工業，或近於美術文化的工業。因此與住居不相妨礙，或者因此相得益彰。還有一事，我看現在上海的居民，也實在太多了，就是那些工廠，也都是麕集在上海，非疏散一下不可。從上海疏散開來，就是到上海附近的各市鎭，各鄉村。那末像自由村那種整潔的鄉村，自然也要受到它的波動了。」何家姊妹聽得朱愛人如此說，也覺得她的話，不是沒有理由。因想愛人平日間，只是關心於某一個產婦，某一個嬰兒的事情，對於地方七的事，允其是自由村的事，她不甚措意。此刻聽她說來，倒也頭頭是道。可見近來女子們的常織，也比以前提高了。這回何家兩位小姐到上海去，還有一件事，也是乘便要商量好的事，却是建築廠屋，請定工程師，一切繪圖設計，也是要預備起來了。那不是有一位現成工程師，就是此番去吃喜酒的新郞，林建成先生嗎？在吃喜酒的時候，附帶給他談談這一筆生意經，也沒有什麼不可以的。就只他們正在忙的時期，結婚以後，不知道他們還要舉行蜜月旅行與吾？聽說金澹雲是上級機關，給了她一個月的假。林建成在此燕爾新婚的時候，他自然也要吿一個月假的，他們在此蜜月之中，正可以到各處去度他們甜蜜的歲月，誰還能忙忙地爲我們繪圖打樣呢？好在我們預備起來，也有好多日子，趁此機會，預先給他說一說，也無不可咧。正是</p>

<h3>Germany Augments Air and Ground Forces to Reinforce the Saar; No Progress on the Western Front; French Forces Adopt a Steady, Deliberate Strategy; Seizing Important Positions by Surprise</h3>
<p>Beijing: Reports from the Rhineland state that the German commander is currently preparing to deal with the full-scale offensive of the British and French forces. Troops are massing en route. It is reported that multiple squadrons of the German Air Force have been transferred from the Polish front to the Western Front. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: Germany is dispatching large reinforcements to the Saar region, hoping to prevent French forces from approaching the Siegfried Line. As a result, the fighting on the Western Front is intensifying today. According to reports received at 1:30 AM this morning (9:30 AM Shanghai time), French forces are now putting up a full-scale resistance. The fighting is particularly fierce in the mountainous terrain near Saarbrucken. This area is located above the Ur Valley, a thousand feet above the ground, with a dense forest and very dangerous terrain. French forces are determined to prevent the German forces from establishing a pontoon bridge on the Saar River. The French army will issue a statement at midnight, saying that the offensive situation is excellent. French forces have cleared German troops from 22 villages in the Warndt Forest and, under the cover of tanks, have advanced beyond several German minefields. These minefields are the vanguard of the Siegfried Line, only twelve miles away. According to French sources, the French Air Force has been extremely active on the Western Front in the past 24 hours. French reconnaissance planes, flying to the Siegfried Line to scout the movements of German troops, have been in communication with them. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Supreme Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 12 tonight, stating, "The enemy is putting up full-scale resistance and counterattacking in certain areas. One of our divisions, demonstrating ingenuity, has captured an important position. Enemy artillery fire is quite active. Our air force continued reconnaissance flights today, unaffected by the sorties of enemy fighter planes." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 13 this morning, stating, "The enemy launched counterattacks in many areas on the front line yesterday. The overall situation has not changed as a result. Our aircraft continue to fly into enemy territory for reconnaissance." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 10, which was brief. Semi-official sources explained it in accordance with yesterday's practice, saying that although the enemy launched a counterattack yesterday, our troops were able to firmly hold the positions they had already occupied and consolidate them overnight. At the same time, the communication lines to the rear were strengthened. As far as the war situation is concerned, the eastern and western fronts are completely different. On the Eastern Front, German forces are using their powerful motorized units to advance along the main transportation arteries of Poland, while the Polish army is launching flank attacks with cavalry. On the Western Front, both the French and British armies are mainly composed of infantry, supplemented by artillery, engineers, and other specialized units. In other words, our army is adopting a steady, deliberate, step-by-step approach. The battle lines are not very long. Whenever our army decides to occupy a position, it consolidates it, making it a rear base, which will also be the base for future offensives. This is in stark contrast to the German army's long-range, direct penetration on the Eastern Front. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris: Semi-official investigations into the situation on the Western Front indicate that the fighting in the western region is still in the "approaching" phase and in a state of siege warfare. There is no question of a full military assault. Specialist units of the advance troops and engineering corps are currently engaged in clearing operations in the areas previously designated for the offensive. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: The war bulletins issued here are concise, but a careful examination reveals the true situation on the Western Front, which is gradually becoming clear. Concrete bunkers along the Rhine River face each other across the bank, facilitating artillery battles. This section of the line, starting from Lauterbourg and ending in Luxembourg, is of utmost importance. The situation around the German Siegfried Line was previously unclear, but since the outbreak of the war, French aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance missions and taking photographs of various points on the German defense line. These photos have now been collected and compiled into detailed maps. In front of this line is a so-called "no man's land," ranging from three to six miles deep. The main focus of the French army is in this area. The French vanguard is now advancing into this area, clearing machine gun nests and outposts, in order to reach the Siegfried Line itself. This strategy allows the Maginot Line to "breathe" and maintains its secrecy with a sky defense as solid as an iron curtain, preventing it from being spied on by the Germans. At the same time, the great mobilization behind the Maginot Line is constantly underway. French forces are currently shelling the Siegfried Line to test its strength and find its weaknesses. Last night's war bulletin mentioned minefields and the destruction of their defensive structures, which is very clear. The minefields are a German defensive arrangement to destroy tanks, and the defensive structures include bridges and tunnels, such as the Saar River Bridge. According to reports from neutral sources, the residents of the Saarbrucken region have been evacuated. Due to this pressure, the movement of German troops to the Polish front has now slowed slightly. It can be seen that the Allied Staff's objective of pressuring the western front to alleviate the crisis on the eastern front is now gradually taking effect. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Polish Army Resists Formidable Enemy; Intense Street Fighting in Warsaw; 32 German Tanks Destroyed; Lodz Occupied by German Forces Yesterday</h3>
<p>Budapest: According to a broadcast from the Warsaw wireless station heard here at 11:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Polish defense forces in Warsaw have repelled repeated German attacks and prevented German troops from entering the city. Although the Germans have repeatedly claimed that the Warsaw city walls are actually in German hands, the Warsaw radio station claims that the Polish defense forces have prevented German troops from entering the city. Polish forces destroyed 32 German tanks. The German army temporarily ceased its attack at noon but continued the offensive in the afternoon. Polish civilians are bravely resisting the German offensive. Warsaw is still in Polish hands. The reporter claims that even the women and children in Warsaw are helping the defense forces dig trenches to resist the German army. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to a wireless broadcast from Warsaw at 5:00 PM yesterday, Warsaw was still under Polish control at that time. The broadcast was providing guidance on air defense methods. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish semi-official news agency PAT recently issued a message stating that German radio stations are using the same wavelength as the Warsaw radio station to broadcast false messages, falsely claiming that Warsaw has fallen. In reality, the Warsaw defense commander is continuing to strengthen the defenses. Although enemy planes are indiscriminately bombing, resulting in continuous deaths and injuries to innocent civilians, the residents of the entire city are very calm and are helping the authorities to build various fortifications. On the western outskirts, many trenches, kilometers in length, have been dug, preparing for a last-ditch defense. In addition, there have been no major changes in the fighting on various fronts today. The withdrawal of our troops from the front lines is in accordance with the planned procedure. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to fragmented reports received here, the fighting in Warsaw was still in the midst of street battles last night. Yesterday morning, a Polish radio announcer admitted that German troops had entered Warsaw. After a number of Polish troops in Warsaw surrendered to the Germans, direct communication between Poland and this area suddenly stopped at 3:15 AM. Sources in Budapest claim that the Warsaw radio station previously declared, "The Polish army intends to defend Warsaw to the last drop of blood." Military experts here claim that the vanguard of the German East Prussian army has reached the confluence of the Vistula and Bug rivers. One expert claims that "the Polish troops remaining on the right bank of the Vistula River face severe danger if they offer stubborn resistance." This is extremely obvious. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German military headquarters issued a statement this morning, saying that the German army has exceeded its original plan and entered the last defense line of the Polish army. German troops have crossed the Bug River behind the San River, occupying Włodawa and Brześć. If this news is true, then the central Polish army will undoubtedly be completely forced to retreat. German troops entering Warsaw are clearing out the remaining Polish troops. German troops occupying Krośniewice and Kutno have advanced towards the Bzura River. There was fierce fighting near Łęczyca, with German troops attempting to cut off the Polish army's retreat route from the Vistula River. National Socialist Party sources said that the Polish army has suffered a major blow and that the final decisive battle in central Poland will take place on the banks of the Narew River northeast of Warsaw. A German spokesman said that the Polish troops in that area have long been subdued by German forces. The Polish troops east of the Narew River, San River, and Vistula River are completely devoid of strength. Regarding rumors that Hitler's goal is to restore the borders of the German Reich as they were in 1914, the spokesman said that this is a misunderstanding. The current area of activity of the German army has exceeded the old borders of 1914. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Late last night, German radio broadcasts announced that, according to the German General Headquarters, German troops had entered Warsaw from the southwest. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Today, according to the official German news agency, German troops have occupied Łódź, located 82 miles southwest of Warsaw. However, Polish sources in London have not yet confirmed this news. Łódź is an important industrial city in Poland, with a normal population of 600,000. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome: Although Poland has lost one-third of its territory, and two to six divisions of the Polish army have been captured by German forces in the Poznań Province, Poland has just begun to fight. In neutral countries, I (this newspaper's special correspondent, Piatti, writing in the first person) have learned that the majority of the Polish army has not yet participated in the war. The Polish government has moved from Warsaw to the Nielisz summer resort near Lublin. Because their movements were discovered by German spies, they had to divide into six groups on the east bank of the Vistula River. After contacting the German army, they made a remarkably successful retreat through difficult terrain. They suffered heavy enemy bombing during their escape. The morale of the Polish soldiers is excellent. Polish civilians, however, have been misled by exaggerated news spread by the pro-Allied camp, such as believing that French troops have crossed the Rhine River, that the people of Mainz, Frankfurt, and Trier have all evacuated, and that they even imagined fifty French aircraft attacking Berlin and that "Berlin had long been bombed into a flat plain." German espionage in Poland has been very effective. Chancellor Hitler is using a large armored force and heavy artillery to attack Warsaw. This large army is only now making its first appearance on the Eastern European battlefield. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently issued the following war report on the Eastern Front: (1) In the south, our army occupied the city of Łódź yesterday. The enemy is retreating eastward, and our army is pursuing the enemy in the mountains and the Vistula River valley. Our mechanized units have also been very successful between the cities of Tomaszów and Kutno. Several enemy divisions have been surrounded by our army. Although they are putting up a last-ditch resistance, their fate will be decided within a few days. (2) In the north, our army is advancing along both banks of the Vistula River and has reached the area west of the city of Płock and northeast of the city of Płock. Our army northeast of Warsaw has also advanced to the south bank of the Bug River. Both sides are engaged in fierce fighting near the city of Łomża. The highways and railways from Warsaw to the city of Vilnius and to the southeast have been destroyed by our air force. Our planes flew to Lublin, the city in eastern Poland (where the Polish government is rumored to have moved), to launch an attack. They engaged in aerial combat with enemy planes, immediately shooting down seven enemy planes and destroying eight enemy planes. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Moscow: In order to protect merchant ships from being attacked by warships of belligerent nations, the government has recently issued an order requiring all merchant ships to paint a national flag on both sides of the hull, with the words "Soviet Federation" attached below. At the same time, three lights should be added to the masthead to distinguish them, the top and bottom lights being green and the middle one red. In addition, all merchant ships that encounter warships or aircraft of belligerent nations at night should send a Morse code signal with lights on the deck, declaring their nationality. Any merchant ship that does not fully comply with these measures will not be allowed to sail abroad. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>British and French Navies Continue Operations; German Merchant Ships Vanish from the High Seas; Overseas Military Supply Sources Cut Off; German Navy Claims to Abide by International Law</h3>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information reports on the continued activities of the British and French navies, stating that German merchant ships have now vanished from the high seas, while British Empire maritime communications continue to be maintained and have not been seriously disrupted. Several German merchant ships have been captured by British warships. Some German merchant ship crews have first scuttled their ships and then abandoned them. Such cases have occurred more than once. At the outbreak of the war, most of the German ships at sea or in neutral ports are now sheltering in neutral ports. Some are sheltering in Vigo, Spain, and various Japanese ports, while others are sheltering in North and South America, Iceland, and other ports. The use of merchant ships as auxiliary armed vessels to launch attacks is also forbidden, as are other tasks during wartime. Except through the Baltic Sea, Germany's overseas military supplies have now been completely cut off. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the official British Ministry of Information statement that the German government has instructed submarines to indiscriminately bomb merchant ships, the German Naval Headquarters yesterday issued the following statement: (1) When the "Athenia" incident occurred, the German Navy had notified all fleets to strictly abide by the provisions of the international conventions on maritime warfare. (2) This order remains in effect. The interview with the captain of the American transport ship "Washington" demonstrates the German Navy's compliance with the order. (3) Germany believes that the purpose of the British Ministry of Information in publishing the above report is solely to incite neutral countries to hate Germany. (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Details of the attempt by a British warship and a bomber to detain the German ship "Flangern" have been released. It is reported that the "Flangern" was warned by a British warship and a British plane at 8:30 AM on September 6 to stop advancing. At the time, the ship was less than 800 meters off the coast of Batu Harbor on the west coast of Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. The ship ignored the warning and continued to advance. The British plane dropped four bombs. The dropping of bombs by the British plane in Dutch territorial waters has violated Dutch neutrality. (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the British cargo ship "Manar" was torpedoed by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean on September 7, without receiving any warning. Most of the crew members were rescued after great difficulty. According to the "Manar" crew members who landed in Lisbon, the ship was equipped with several 4-inch cannons. When the ship was intercepted by the German submarine, the ship immediately opened fire. (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Siegfried Line in the West</h3>
<p>New York: The famous American commentator, Foster, recently published an article in the "New York World-Telegram" commenting on the Allied claims of breaking through the German Siegfried Line, adopting a rather satirical tone. The article stated, "The Siegfried Line built by Germany is unprecedented in its scale of construction. The line has not been breached by French forces, and the construction of the line is layered, with fortresses, machine gun nets, artillery batteries, tanks, and traps, all of which are equipped, and cannot be broken in one fell swoop." (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Battlefield Losses; German Casualties</h3>
<p>Beijing: Polish sources indicate that, to date, German casualties must already be in the tens of thousands. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A bulletin was released here last night detailing German losses in Poland, stating that although German forces have been engaged in intense fighting in various places in Poland, the losses are not significant. According to senior commanders, from September 4 to 6, the German army suffered four deaths and seventeen injuries per ten thousand men. If the six days since the outbreak of the war are added to the calculation, then the number is five deaths and forty injuries per ten thousand men. It is claimed that this figure is the average number for all units participating in the Eastern Front. The units participating in intense battles have suffered greater losses than other units.

<h3>Soviet Union Mobilizes Reserves; Moscow Displays Wartime Atmosphere; Rumors of Secret German-Soviet Pact to Partition Poland</h3>
<p>Paris: According to reports from London yesterday, it is said that the Soviet Union and Germany have signed a secret pact to divide Poland according to the borders of 1914. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Due to the increasing expansion and tension of the German-Polish war, the Soviet government has recently ordered the partial conscription of reserves from certain age groups in order to strengthen national defense. The military districts that have already begun conscription include Ukraine, Belarus, Leningrad, Moscow, Kalinin, and Orel. (TASS, 10th)</p>
<p>London: A Soviet spokesman told the Associated Press here last night that the Russian mobilization is purely a precautionary measure and is not directed at Poland. However, the Polish government is still extremely suspicious of this, believing that a Soviet-German military agreement has been finalized recently. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Yesterday, many officers at the Kursk Military School were officially promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Many officers at the Kiev Military School were also promoted. (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to reports received here from various sources, the Soviet Union has been mobilizing reserves from multiple age groups since yesterday, including those who completed their military service five or even ten years ago. All those called up are to report immediately to designated assembly points. The destination of their organized departure has not been announced. It is believed that it is definitely not simply for exercises and autumn drills and must be related to strengthening the defense of the western border. (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The conscription of reserves in various places is continuing smoothly and in an orderly manner. The situation in Moscow is unprecedented in recent years. Young men are going to designated locations in the early morning. The number of people receiving conscription notices is very large. Barracks and other military institutions are full, and troops have also been stationed in various schools. In addition to their passports, reserves who are required to enlist must bring several days' worth of food, underwear, and other items. Employers are prepaying reservists two weeks' worth of salary and wages. There is a lively atmosphere at the various stations. Reservists are arriving in Moscow from various places and have begun to be dispatched to the western front. Ticket sales to Minsk, Smolensk, and other places have been suspended. Purchasers must present military identification. Most of the reservists are between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-two. Military technical personnel and other experts are older. The public mood is very calm. (Haito News Agency, 10th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain Begins "Resisting Aggression"</h3>
<p>At the end of August, this newspaper, based on a Reuters dispatch from London, reported that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had assured Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, that even if the European situation underwent drastic changes, Britain's Far Eastern policy would not change. Now, Germany has opened fire on Poland, and Britain and France have declared war on Germany. The foul, cowardly, ambiguous, and sinister atmosphere of peace that once enveloped Europe and misled humanity has now dissipated like smoke. The continuous artillery fire has become the dawn of day, and the bloodshed has irrigated the gardens of civilization. The complacent dreams have been shattered, and Europe has undergone dramatic changes. At this juncture, it is also known that Ambassador Guo and the British Foreign Secretary exchanged views again on the 8th of this month, agreeing that it would be beneficial for China and Britain to share interests and jointly resist aggression. The British Foreign Secretary further stated that Britain's Far Eastern policy remains unchanged and reaffirmed that China's independence and prosperity are of great importance to British interests and world peace. China has endured immense suffering and gained worldly wisdom over the past few years. It is accustomed to hearing all sorts of words and will not feel flattered by Halifax's statement. However, China has also gained experience through hardship. This year's "September 3rd" for Britain is akin to China's "July 7th" incident two years ago. Before Britain declared war on Germany on September 3rd of this year, it endured humiliation and sought complete accommodation. Its Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax were ridiculed and scorned by public opinion. How is this different from China before the full-scale war of resistance after the July 7th incident? When it became unbearable and they resolutely went to war, there were no distractions, no diversions, the path was clear, and the spirit was pure, moving forward without hesitation and without looking back. This state of spiritual ease and righteousness cannot be understood by Britain after "September 3rd" unless it has experienced China after "July 7th." Nor can it be understood without experiencing hardship. Without mutual understanding, there can be no agreement. Therefore, we can imagine that what the British Foreign Secretary said to Ambassador Guo was a sincere and candid exchange of views, not comparable to the usual superficial diplomatic rhetoric.</p>
<p>Aggression is the exposure of humanity's barbaric instincts. War is an act that transcends human reason. The actions of civilized humanity must diligently seek reason as a guide, and always regard war as evil. Cruel and irrational, the impact of war is bound to be cruel. However, the evil of aggression is greater than that of war. Twenty-one years have passed since the end of World War I, and the scars have not yet fully healed. The impression of cruelty is still deeply engraved in the eyes and hearts of those who value reason. Therefore, Chamberlain and his ilk, although witnessing the barbaric instincts displayed by some humans, had their reason, which should have prevented self-immolation, obscured by the cruel impression, and they harbored a侥幸hope that disaster would not befall them. Did he not say to his countrymen half a year ago, "I do not wish to see the cruelty of war again in my lifetime!" Who knew that barbaric instincts have the function of suggestion, contagion, and spread, and soon spread from the Far East to the European continent, eventually prompting Chamberlain to awaken a deeper reason and be forced to declare war. Rejecting Stimson's proposal, abandoning the sanctions of the League of Nations, and sacrificing Czechoslovakia to satisfy the appetites of the greedy were, at the time, considered normal and rational ways to benefit Britain, avoid other people's problems, and stay away from right and wrong. Who knew that barbaric instincts could never be healed by normal reason? It is only by liberating the war obscured by reason that one can hope to contain it. For evil lies only in aggression, war is not evil, and resisting aggression, without fearing war, is the ultimate in benevolence, righteousness, courage, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Moreover, human habits develop in many directions, tending toward good if they encourage goodness and toward evil if they reward evil. Generally, reason has reached a considerable level, and the difference between civilization and barbarity is not as vast as heaven and earth. Those who expose their barbaric instincts do so partly out of their own will and partly because of the indulgence of the environment, and they do not necessarily maintain those instincts forever. This is an old adage, but the British declaration of war on Germany today has revealed a phenomenon below common sense. Have you not heard the news from neutral countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands after the declaration of war? The German authorities did not expect that Britain would be determined to fulfill its obligations to help Poland, even to the point of declaring war. Have you not heard General Goering's speech to the workers yesterday, six days after the start of the war? He attacked Britain, still hoping that British Prime Minister Chamberlain would choose between peace and war. It is evident that the German authorities still do not deeply believe in Britain's determination to resist aggression. Alas, are the German authorities so foolish and ignorant? Observing the events of the past five years, the international community has indulged aggression and rewarded aggression, never punishing evil and encouraging good. It is no wonder that the habits of its people have developed in the direction of barbarity. The international community should not tolerate aggression, but in recent years, its indulgence and reward have been close to trapping people in injustice. Now that Britain has raised the banner of resisting aggression, it realizes that China's rise is of like mind and shared path, which has not been seen in recent years. Germany, having received this head-on blow, will ultimately have no chance of survival. Will those who are displaying their barbaric instincts also restore their reason, change their ways, and realize their mistakes? To say that it will not be too late to change before the end is to underestimate the difference between human wisdom and foolishness. To say that punishing one is not enough to deter a hundred is to underestimate the boundlessness of human catastrophe.</p>
<h3>The British Government Instructs All Departments to Prepare for a Three-Year War Plan, Determined Not to Stop Until Hitlerism is Overthrown, Determined Not to Be Swayed by Peace Propaganda</h3>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information announced that the wartime cabinet will meet this morning to decide on policies based on the assumption that the war will last three years or more. Instructions are being issued to various administrative departments to immediately begin preparing future plans based on this assumption. Various plans that have already been prepared must now be actively implemented. The expansion of national defense plans is already underway. The Ministry of Munitions will immediately take necessary steps to massively increase the capacity to manufacture various munitions to meet various situations. The Navy and Air Force are making appropriate arrangements. The maintenance of domestic needs and export trade is also being considered for the sake of national interests. The wartime cabinet believes that this important decision will receive the unanimous support of the people and the welcome of allied and friendly nations. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the most important thing is not the government's policy of basing itself on a three-year war, but Britain's determination to break Hitlerism and persevere to the end. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London - Diplomatic circles here recently said that once Germany has a sufficient advantage within Poland's borders, it will propose "peace proposals." At that time, it will definitely seek the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to serve as an intermediary. However, British officials said that these proposals are not worth considering. The British government has decided to unite with its allies and continue the war until National Socialism is overthrown. At this time, the Polish army is still able to resist for a long time. In addition, the Anglo-French offensive on the Western Front will definitely have a restraining effect and greatly benefit Poland's war of resistance. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Outbreak of the European War Was a Miscalculation by Hitler, According to Japanese Prime Minister Abe; Parisian Newspapers Agree</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Abe told reporters today that the outbreak of the European war was due to Hitler's miscalculation and solemnly declared that Japan would not be drawn into the vortex. Japan's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain may need to be readjusted in the future. However, some people think that the European war will give Japan an opportunity to easily resolve the China issue, which is a serious mistake. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Former member of the Military Council, Admiral Nakamura, said today that Hitler is a "landlubber" who ignored the decisive power of the British and French navies and did not give them full consideration. The current situation is more unfavorable to Germany than in 1914. Even if Warsaw is occupied by German troops and Italy mediates, it is impossible for Britain and France to give Germany what it needs. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris - The "Strong Will" newspaper criticized Germany's blitzkrieg strategy and the Anglo-French strategy of delaying the war to win a complete victory, saying that according to various observations, Hitler seems to say to himself, "I will quickly defeat Poland and then negotiate peace." But Hitler is wrong, as can be seen from British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons. (9th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Newspapers Comment on the War Situation; The Deeper the German Army Advances, the More Difficult It Will Be</h3>
<p>The Hague - Newspapers here recently commented on the European war. The "People's Daily" stated that once Poland's front line is greatly shortened, the German army will come into contact with the main force of the Polish army, and will no longer be able to drive straight in. Moreover, Romania is still continuing to supply Poland, which will facilitate future resistance. Not only that, the eastern part of Poland is rugged and has no good roads. The deeper the German army advances, the more difficult it will be. It will be even worse once the autumn rains begin. The "Xiong Bao" newspaper stated that Germany now hopes to defeat Poland and then conduct peace talks with Britain and France. "If Britain and France refuse, Germany will have no worries in the east and can concentrate its troops on the western border. If the Allied forces are still defeated, plus Hitler's goal in attacking Poland is not something the Soviet Union seems interested in, it can be seen that there is no secret agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union on the Polish issue. According to this, Germany still needs a large number of troops on the eastern front to maintain its position. Even if the German army controls the entire territory of Poland, it will be of great military significance, but the current general situation may not change much." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>American Red Cross Donates $50,000 to Help the Polish Red Cross</h3>
<p>Washington - The American Red Cross has decided to allocate $50,000 to purchase medicines and tents to donate to the Polish Red Cross. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - The Shipping Association of New York announced that all freight charges for goods shipped from New York and other ports on the Atlantic Ocean to ports in the Far East will be increased by 20%. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Lloyd George's Speech: Britain Fights for Justice</h3>
<p>London - Former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George recently wrote an article entitled "Britain Fights for Justice," stating, "Once again we are fighting for international justice. Our goal is to have others recognize that all nations, regardless of strength or weakness, have equal rights. If all nations can refrain from interfering in the affairs of their neighbors, then they can all live independently in peace. The major powers of Western Europe gave an aggressor a lesson in 1914. Today, they must give this country the same lesson again. It is hoped that this will be the last time. We are fighting for the interests of humanity and the future of civilization. However, the burden may be greater than in 1914. If we fail, the harm may be more severe than in 1918. This must be understood." As for Poland's war of resistance, the country's defensive power depends on three factors: (1) the ability of the country's commander; (2) whether the country's army has built solid positions as strongholds for resistance; and (3) the morale of the country's army. With regard to the first item, the battle of Westerplatte has proved the resistance of the Polish people and cannot be taken lightly. With regard to the third item, the country's army has shown no signs of weakness so far, which is commendable. If the Polish army can use strong fortifications to stop the German advance in the future, then the war situation may be changed. In addition, with the activities of the French army, it will not be difficult to succeed in one fell swoop, because the French army is so well-trained that no country can match it. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London - Former Labor government Foreign Secretary Dalton said in a speech in Warkland today that this battle is to defend civilization against Hitlerism. From the perspective of historical victory, Britain and its allies may have been defeated many times in the war, but they always won in the end. We are still in the early stages, and Britain's air force has already achieved great results in preemptive strikes, hitting German battleships with several heavy bombs and sending hundreds of copies of real leaflets to the German people. We are still in the early stages, but the people should undergo a heroic test, and its victorious conclusion will belong to us. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Canada Declares War on Germany</h3>
<p>Ottawa - The Federal Government held a meeting late yesterday to draft a declaration of war against Germany. Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir is expected to sign it at 8:00 AM local time today. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Ottawa - Canadian Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir read King George VI's edict to a joint session of the Senate and House of Commons yesterday, urging the Canadian Federation to cooperate in the fight against aggression. Prime Minister Mackenzie King then gave a speech, emphasizing that the Canadian Federation should cooperate closely with Britain. The Senate and House of Commons also passed memorials today, expressing their approval. In other words, it is recognized that the Canadian Federation and Germany are already at war. In this way, Canada's declaration of war against Germany will soon become a reality. Moreover, during the discussion of war matters in the Senate and House of Commons, the vast majority of members supported the government. Minister of Justice Lapointe gave a speech in the House of Commons late in the evening, stating that Canada maintains a constitutional connection with Britain and has no possibility of remaining neutral. "If our freedom and democracy are threatened, the Canadian Federation has no other option but to participate in the war." A senator declared in the Senate that if we do not stop the progress of National Socialism on the Vistula River in time, we may have to stop it on the St. Lawrence River in the future. The opportunity is urgent and cannot be delayed. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - According to news here today, Associated Press correspondent Belden (also known as White) and Continental Daily News reporter Farmer are currently being detained in Ji'an by the Chinese military authorities. It is said that the reason for their detention is that the two did not obtain military passports and inspected various places without authorization. Moreover, Belden did not have an American passport with him when he was arrested. According to reports, this is the second time Belden has been detained. The first time was in Lanzhou, when he was photographing Soviet aircraft and was arrested. After examining the photos taken, it was discovered that there were no military secrets, and he was released. It is said that Belden and Farmer departed from Shanghai three weeks ago, with the aim of reaching Chongqing through the war zone and writing articles for foreign magazines about what they saw along the way. Farmer was a reporter for the Shanghai China Press two years ago, and later worked at the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing. He returned to Shanghai two months ago and joined the Continental Daily News. Belden happily resigned from his reporting duties to travel to the interior. (Associated Press, 10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Changes to China Policy; Government Authorities Meet Continuously to Promote Sino-Soviet Relations; Hope for Further Assistance from the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Great attention is being paid here to the international situation and its impact on China. Chinese government authorities have been meeting continuously. Song Ziwen, who flew here from Hong Kong a few days ago, also attended the meeting. According to government officials, there is no change in China's policy. General attention is focused on Britain's attitude towards Japan. In addition to striving to promote diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China believes that the importance of the United States in the Far East has suddenly increased after the outbreak of the European war, and therefore also hopes to obtain further assistance from the United States. (Haitong News Agency, 10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese newspapers here all printed British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's assurance that Britain's China policy would not be affected by the European war in large type. Chinese sources here who were worried that Britain might, due to the war, increase its pressure on China's resistance to Japan, expressed great satisfaction after receiving the news. The independent Xinmin Daily published a commentary on this matter this morning, stating that the British Foreign Secretary's guarantee has shattered Japan's hope of forcing Britain to cooperate with its aggression in China. Britain's "seemingly weak attitude" in the Far East is entirely due to pressure from Europe and is not Britain's willingness to compromise with Japan. (Reuters, 10th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Initial Fishing Season in the Chaoshan Area Under Japanese Military Invasion. Yellow Croaker Schools Have Arrived with the East Wind and White Waves. Fishermen Have Some Gains but Difficulty Transporting and Selling.</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence – Since the Japanese military invasion of China, fishermen along the Chaoshan coast have suffered heavy losses. More than eight thousand fishing boats and salt boats in Nan'ao, Raoping, Zhao'an, Tongshan, Chenghai, Chaoyang, Huilai, Lufeng, Haifeng, and other counties have been sunk or burned by Japanese warships. More than thirty thousand fishermen have died or lost their entire families at sea. At least one million people who rely on fishing for a living are suffering from hunger and disease. Even after the fall of Shantou, the Japanese army, with a small number of troops, penetrated deep into Chao'an and fought fiercely with the Chinese army along the Chaoshan Railway. Although they no longer have the strength to take care of the coastal area, there are still one or two warships anchored in Shantou port, dispatching speedboats to operate on the sea, causing most fishermen to still not dare to go out to sea to make a living. However, the climate in Chaoshan is such that every year after the seventh month of the lunar calendar marks the beginning of the fishing season. The east wind and white waves come from afar, bit by bit, towards the coast, bringing with them marine products such as yellow croaker, pomfret, and thin-shelled clams. According to old seafarers, the seafood brought by the east wind to eastern Guangdong in recent days indicates that this autumn's fishing season will definitely be bountiful. He pointed to the moving clouds and said that the first wave of yellow croaker schools has arrived within ten miles of the coast. Pomfret, cuttlefish, and squid are also continuing to move towards Nan'ao and Chaoyang in large numbers. Unfortunately, the large trawlers have been almost completely destroyed by enemy warship artillery fire, making it impossible to trawl for these fish. Fortunately, from mid-August, most of the Japanese warships on the Fujian-Guangdong sea area were transferred elsewhere, so fishermen quietly sailed out to sea to fish. They used three-zhang-long shrimp boats instead of trawlers, tentatively setting out from Haimen and Dahao to cast their nets. They fished mostly within three miles of the shore and, as expected, it was particularly abundant. Because large-scale encirclement and netting had been impossible for the past two years, the fish considered this bay to be their only haven, so every time the fishermen went out to sea, they returned fully loaded. Unfortunately, transportation to various places was cut off at this time, making it impossible to transport and sell the fish. In the Dahao area, one yuan could buy only four catties of rice, and each person could only buy one catty per day. Fresh fish could be bought for ten to fifteen catties per yuan. Therefore, everyone was willing to eat fish instead of rice. The fishermen dried fish like flounder, yellow croaker, squid, black fish, and prawns, using small sailboats to transport them to Hong Kong in exchange for matches, kerosene, and daily necessities. Since Dahao had become an occupied area, with no Japanese troops stationed in the town and no customs officials from the Chinese government, it became the freest trading port, specializing in the transport of seafood to Hong Kong. There were fifty or sixty small sailboats, as small as bamboo leaves, less than two zhang long, drifting back and forth in the big waves, dedicated to transporting and selling this seafood. According to sailors, when Japanese warships encountered fishing boats, they only asked for some fresh fish, sometimes giving some rice or sugar in exchange. Another day, they gave out propaganda from the Peace and National Salvation Army, ordering the fishermen to take it to the people on the shore to read. Tongshan Island in Zhao'an, Fujian, was occupied by four Japanese warships firing artillery on August 22nd. The island's self-defense forces bravely fought back, but were eventually outnumbered and hid in the rocky caves on the top of the mountain. The island is a salt-producing area, and all the stored salt, estimated at more than five thousand tons, was looted. Furthermore, two hundred carrying boats were seized, and the entire island's people were required to provide joint guarantees of five households, and to hand over the self-defense forces on the mountain, before they would be allowed to freely dry salt and fish. Nan'ao's coastal area also suffered the same blockade. The fishing season has arrived, but not a single fishing boat has been seen sailing out from Nan'ao. The remaining people in the county have been unable to communicate with Raoping and Chenghai. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army in Nan'ao dispatched eight speedboats to intercept ships at the ports of Haishan Island, Jingzhou, Zhuizao, Waisha, Nanbei Harbor in Raoping. In addition, two warships fired artillery to provide cover. Many coastal village houses and fishing boats preparing to go to sea were destroyed and sunk. Furthermore, sixteen Japanese boats from Haishan Island invaded the vicinity of Tuolin, Huanggang, and Jingjin. At noon, the tide receded and the water dried up, making it impossible to sail out. The Chinese soldiers used skateboards to slide through the mud and attack, sinking several Japanese speedboats and killing fifty to sixty Japanese soldiers. Everything on board was seized by the Chinese. At 5 p.m., the tide rose again, and the Japanese warships approached Tuolin again, firing more than thirty shells at Huanggang, reducing nearby fishing villages to rubble, but dared not charge ashore.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this year's fishing season, fishermen along the Guangdong coast can only sigh at the sea. Dongshan and Nan'ao, which have been occupied, have been blockaded. In other places, they are wantonly ravaged by Japanese troops when they are defeated. Chaoyang Dahao, because the Chinese army abandoned it, and the Japanese troops have no strength to defend it, use gentle means to only appease the fishermen, not because the Japanese side has any love for Dahao.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Rugao Capture Three Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Rugao Correspondence – Xinsheng Port is the end point of the Rugao-Xinpu Highway and an important port in Rugao County. The Japanese side has stationed heavy troops there, and nearby villages are often plundered. At the end of last month, the Chinese army learned that He Gaoshan of Xinsheng Township (about ten miles from Xinsheng Port) was being used by the Japanese army, so they went to arrest him. After completing the mission and returning to their original defenses, they encountered three Japanese soldiers on the way. The Chinese army immediately used box cannons to shoot, and the three Japanese immediately surrendered and were bound. They were escorted to the higher authorities for disposition.</p>

<h3>Goering's Speech Alienates Britain and France, Coerces Peace, Says Polish Military Can Be Resolved in Four Weeks, Then Asks Chamberlain to Reply to Demands for War and Peace</h3>
<p>Berlin – Air Minister and Prussian Governor-General Hermann Goering delivered a speech at noon today to workers at the Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (German Weapons and Munitions Factories), the largest armaments factory in Germany, near Berlin. He first described the events that caused the war among the European countries, and then said that Germany had two lines of defense: the first line was soldiers, and the second line was workers. He praised the munitions workers, and when he mentioned the current war, Goering strongly criticized Britain, saying: "The reason why Poland dares to blatantly reject the Führer's generous proposals is entirely due to the protection of the British Empire. We acknowledge British interests on five continents and have never interfered in British politics, but whenever our country takes measures to protect its legitimate interests, Britain must come out to interfere and obstruct it. If Britain wants to avoid a large-scale conflict, it only needs to exert effective pressure on Poland to make it accept Germany's moderate proposals. It is nothing but deception to claim that it wants to resolve serious issues through negotiations. In recent days, British and European politicians have claimed that they are not at war with Germany, but with Hitler's Nazi government. However, when they fire their guns, they are firing at the German people. Britain also flaunts morality, claiming that its decision to participate in the war is to protect small countries, but in fact, according to history, the British Empire is the country that has annexed the most small and weak nations in the world. The reason why it has become such a great power is entirely due to this method. Therefore, morality is also a deception."</p>
<p>Goering continued: "Britain is challenging Germany in three ways: (1) Military, (2) Economic, (3) Domestic. In the military aspect, Germany is facing Britain, France, and Poland alone, but Germany's western fortifications are as solid as soup, and its coastal defenses are impenetrable. The Polish war is expected to destroy the main force within a week, and clear the remnants in another two weeks, for a total of one month. Then, seventy divisions of troops will be withdrawn from the east and sent to the west, so the position of the German army will definitely not be inferior. Moreover, with the German-Soviet pact, Germany will never be attacked from the rear and can concentrate on dealing with the western front. Britain should also be aware of this. Today, British planes only come to Germany to distribute leaflets. If they replace leaflets with bombs, Germany will take the same action. Therefore, Britain's military challenge to Germany will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the economic aspect, I dare to declare publicly that our country is the country with the most soundly organized institutions in the world. Even in terms of the armaments production system, Germany can be said to be unparalleled in the world. Today, the only thing we care about is work, nothing else. Although other countries have more gold, copper, tin, and zinc, Germany has the most capable and willing workers. The achievements in the past have been excellent, and we must work even harder in the future. Although Germany is said to lack raw materials, it still has a surplus of the two most important materials, coal and iron. Moreover, in addition to imposing certain restrictions on some raw materials, Germany has invented some substitutes that are more convenient and easier to use than British raw materials, which must be forcibly transported from distant colonies to the islands. Therefore, no matter how long this war lasts, the German economic organization will definitely not be affected."</p>
<p>Goering then discussed the issue of blockade, pointing out that Germany's blockade today is completely different from that during World War I. At that time, Britain blockaded the west, Russia blockaded the east, and some small countries blockaded the southeast. Today, because of the neutrality of the various small and medium-sized countries, the only area that is blockaded is from Denmark to Basel. Since Germany and the Soviet Union have decided to unite, they will never sacrifice themselves for Britain and kill each other. Both the Soviet Union and Poland have sufficient raw materials to supply Germany. The small countries in Southeastern Europe must carefully consider whether to participate in Britain's encirclement plan. If there is instability, Germany will take swift and decisive action to stabilize it. During World War I, the German front was as long as 3,800 kilometers, but this western continuous front is only 250 kilometers.</p>
<p>Goering then clarified that Germany has no demands on France. He is not worried even if the United States joins the blockade of Germany, because trade between the two countries has been very sluggish in recent years. The cessation of American goods will not have a major impact.</p>
<p>Referring to the various atrocities in Poland, Goering asked British Prime Minister Chamberlain: "If Mr. Chamberlain still regards the Polish nation as a valuable nation, then it is also a shame on morality. Thirty-one German pilots were forced to land, and they were all assassinated by Polish people. What do you think, Your Excellency? I would very much like to hear your reply in a future parliamentary speech."</p>
<p>Goering finally declared: "This declaration of war was made by Chamberlain, not by Führer Hitler. Germany has no demands on France and is willing to seek peace at any time with countries that do not oppress Germany and do not persecute Germans. But at the same time, it is also making all preparations to fight to the end if necessary. Germany's desire for peace is definitely not a sign of weakness. The key to war and peace lies in the hands of the other party. The German side can only do its best to negotiate. What must be solemnly declared is that there is an inseparable bond between the German people and the Führer. The Führer is Germany, and Germany is Hitler." (October 9th, Hai Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland – German Air Minister Hermann Goering delivered a speech today to workers at a munitions factory in Berlin, saying in brief: "The British side extravagantly claims that its planes bombed our naval base on the 4th of this month, and that a warship was hit by a bomb. In fact, what landed on the deck of the ship was not a British bomb, but a British pilot, because the plane he was flying had been shot down. In addition, British planes have scattered leaflets over Germany. If these leaflets were replaced with bombs, Germany would immediately retaliate. Looking at the war record in the eight days since the war began, our army has captured vast territories in Poland on the eastern front, and the Polish capital has been surrounded. The remnants of the Polish army have been surrounded and have no way to escape. The mopping-up work is about to end. As for France, we have nothing to ask of the French. Poland has guaranteed the French border, but if the French still want to fight with the British, that is their business, and we cannot dissuade them. However, we have no need on the French side, nor do we have any reason to attack that country. This fact cannot be denied. Our country has enough food, but to be prepared, you should still reduce your food intake and develop habits, and you can also lose some weight. We really need this. The frequent air raid alerts are too frequent. The reason is that those responsible for sounding the alarm are too flustered. But our country has not yet been threatened by enemy planes, which I can tell you." The government authorities have prohibited the people from listening to foreign radio broadcasts, not to hide the facts and prevent the people from knowing them, but because listening to foreign lies is contrary to honor. "If we are not united, we cannot win. Foreign propaganda is trying to seduce the German people, but as long as Führer Hitler lives, this propaganda will not be effective." Goering then touched on France, saying, "We Germans do not want to slaughter the French people, nor do we want to conquer land in France and Britain, but Britain is the only country that desires war, and wants France to fight to the last man. If Prime Minister Chamberlain forces us to fight, the intensity of the struggle will be unprecedented. The crossroads of war and peace are before you, and only Mr. Chamberlain can choose it."

<h3>British Air Force Violates Neutrality, Belgian Planes Take Off to Intercept, One British Plane Forced to Land, Britain Apologizes to the Belgian Government to Settle the Matter</h3>
<p>London – According to officials here today, after the British Air Force flew over German airspace last night for reconnaissance, they mistakenly passed over Belgian territory, resulting in a conflict with Belgian fighter planes. British aircraft pilots had strict instructions to take refuge in the airspace of neutral countries. This border crossing was due to a temporary oversight, so the British government has instructed its ambassador to Belgium to apologize to the Belgian government. (October 9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Brussels – Three foreign planes flew over Belgian airspace last night. Two of them were identified as British heavy bombers. Belgian interceptors took off to pursue them. One of the bombers immediately landed, and the five pilots were arrested. The plane was carrying propaganda to be distributed over Germany. The second plane continued to move forward, and three Belgian interceptors pursued it to within six kilometers of French airspace before closing in. They then fired flares at the British plane, forcing it to land. Unexpectedly, the British plane failed to recognize them, mistakenly believing it was under attack, and immediately retaliated, immediately shooting down a Belgian plane. Two Belgian pilots jumped out with parachutes and were slightly injured. At that time, the British plane had already flown into French airspace. Public opinion in Belgium was extremely shaken after this incident, but because the Belgian Air Force was able to deal with it forcefully, it was indeed fulfilling its duties. (October 9th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels – The Belgian Ministry of Defense issued a special communiqué last night, saying, "Three British heavy bombers were pursued by our air force. One of them was forced to land.

<h3>Sino-British Border Situation: Japanese Army Extends Blockade Line, Hong Kong Can Only Communicate with Macau, Completely Isolated from Guangdong Province Interior</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army is rapidly and frequently moving on the Sino-British border. Outsiders mistakenly believe that a large-scale withdrawal is underway, leading to rumors that the border situation has eased. There were also false reports of British troops returning home. The Hong Kong military authorities have repeatedly denied this. Simultaneously, the Japanese army has further extended the Hong Kong border blockade, starting from Daya Bay and extending west to the Tin Hau Temple in Chiwan, stationing troops along the Sino-British land and water border, isolating Kowloon completely. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Army Completes Blockade of Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to official sources, the Japanese army on the border has not only not withdrawn but is expanding its operations. However, the Japanese army in Nantou has indeed decreased compared to three or four days ago. It is unknown whether they have returned to transport ships. It is believed that the movements of the Japanese army in Nantou are still within Bao'an territory. Official sources also indicate that the Japanese military operations have extended to the coastal area in front of蘋馬士灣, thus completing the blockade of Hong Kong. It is also understood that rumors have been circulating for days that the Japanese army in Nantou has begun to withdraw. The reason for their withdrawal is evidently to transfer troops to transport ships to Daya Bay, intending to land there to complete the plan to blockade the Hong Kong border. It is reported that a Japanese brigade (over 12,000 people) is stationed along the tip of the peninsula that divides蘋馬士灣 and Daya Bay, all the way to Nantou. As a result of the Japanese blockade, Hong Kong, apart from the route to Macau, is completely isolated from the mainland.</p>
<p>Mainland Food Cannot Be Transported to Hong Kong</p>
<p>When the Japanese army occupied Nantou to Shatoujiao, a large amount of food was transported by boat through Chinese waters into the British waters of蘋馬士灣, because the waters of蘋馬士灣 are British territory, and the shore is Chinese territory, so Japanese boats could not enter. The Japanese army has now expanded the blockade line to Daya Bay to prevent cargo boats from entering British territorial waters via this route. Maritime traffic between Hong Kong and Bao'an has resumed in the past two days, but because the Japanese have announced a ban on the transport of food to Hong Kong, the Bao'an transport boats operating on this route have suspended service again since August 30. It is said that the Japanese army not only prohibits goods from being transported out but also prohibits Nantou people from coming to Hong Kong, so even if the transport boats resume service, there will be no cargo or passengers.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong army is scheduled to hold exercises in the southeast area of Hong Kong for two consecutive days, starting on the 31st, covering the area from Shau Kei Wan to Pok Fu Lam Road. The procedures for the exercises have not been announced by the army authorities, but it is understood that British, Middlesex, Scottish, Indian, and Lanford Tanner rifle teams and a volunteer army will participate, and machine gun units and armored vehicles will appear on various roads within the area. In addition to testing defense capabilities, great emphasis will also be placed on the speed of troop movements and flexibility of command. When the Sino-British border was tense, the Hong Kong government advised foreigners outside the border to move back to Kowloon or Hong Kong to avoid danger.</p>
<p>Governor of Hong Kong Implements Emergency Regulations</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government began calling up volunteer troops for service on ships on the 30th. In the afternoon, a gazette was issued stating that the Governor of Hong Kong, under the Emergency Powers Ordinance, summoned naval volunteers for service. The first group of fifty people was called up, including over twenty Chinese.</p>
<p>Air Defense Drills Simulate Air Raid Alerts</p>
<p>The Hong Kong military authorities, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, have been conducting air defense drills every night. At 9:30 pm on the 29th, the Hong Kong air defense department, assuming that it had received a report from a lookout post that enemy aircraft were planning to attack Hong Kong, immediately ordered all air defense units in Hong Kong to prepare. Soon after, a squadron of enemy aircraft, of unknown number, infiltrated Hong Kong airspace. All air search teams immediately gave a shout, and all lights were turned on, searching the sky. At that time, the enemy aircraft were extremely cunning and quickly evaded, making it difficult for the searchlights to find them. After several minutes, they were finally found. Only one aircraft had entered the city airspace. The searchlights then focused on one point, chasing and shooting at it, so that the anti-aircraft artillery could find the target. At that time, the enemy aircraft was completely illuminated in the flames, clear and distinct. Although it tumbled high and low, it could not escape the light net of the searchlights, and hastily fled out of the encirclement, while the searchlights continued to chase relentlessly until it disappeared. The airspace around Hong Kong was then searched again, and when no other aircraft were found, the drill was declared over. The Hong Kong Air Defense Department also reported that air raid sirens were tested at the Kowloon Dockyard and were also held at the Kowloon warehouse.</p>
<h3>Plague Rampant in Songjiang and Jiaxing; Japanese Troops Suffering Many Deaths; Rice Robbery Occurs in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: In Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Jiashan, cholera and dysentery are prevalent. Many people are dying one after another. People in the countryside are suffering from a lack of medicine and are resigned to their fate. The number of Japanese soldiers dying from the epidemic has already exceeded ten. Therefore, the Japanese troops in the three places have completely blockaded land and water traffic, prohibiting residents of the three places from going out. Women and children outside the city who want to enter the city must undergo strict inspection and disinfection before being allowed to enter. The pseudo-pacification unit under徐樸誠 arrived in 40 石 yesterday and were stationed inside and outside the city. The顧 family 洋房 in 顧家埭 was dismantled by the Japanese army, and it is rumored that the famous historical site東園 will be converted into a Japanese club. Many shops have been opened by Japanese in the city, such as 東都药堂, etc. New rice from the four villages is about to be marketed, but it is under the control of the Japanese, who are not allowed to transport it out of the territory. The price of rice is 22 yuan per 石. Several cases of rice robbery have occurred in the northwest villages.</p>
<h3>Wu County Puppet Government Levies Various Arbitrary Taxes; Recently Launches Household Donation</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Wu County's government expenses were abundant. Before the occupation, the income from land tax alone was sufficient to cover the county's expenses. The pseudo-county government was established last April. Although it still relies on land tax revenue, the situation is different now. Also, the four villages are controlled by the Chinese army, resulting in a total levy far less than in previous years. Although the pseudo-county government has scraped in various ways, it has been in debt for over 250,000 yuan for a year. Therefore, pseudo- Magistrate郭曾基 is planning to collect taxes from hotels, restaurants, soda, chimney sweeping, and daily necessities. Recently, a special household donation has been launched. All measures have been approved by the pseudo-county government advisory council and will be implemented soon. It is reported that the starting amount is 15%, but the people of Suzhou have already been unable to bear the heavy taxes levied by the pseudo-county government, and their livelihood will be even more difficult in the future.</p>

<h3>Nation's Elite Responsible for Training Middle School Teachers; Provisional Regulations Promulgated by the Ministry to be Abolished</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) In the past, the Ministry of Education considered that there was no professional training place for middle school teachers. On June 9th of the 26th year, Instruction No. 11000 was issued to promulgate the Provisional Regulations for University Training of Middle School Teachers, and the whole country was ordered to comply with it. Now, the Normal Colleges and the Normal Colleges of various universities will also begin enrollment from the 17th year. From then on, there will be professional training places for middle school teachers. University graduates who volunteer to become middle school teachers should take the entrance examination to the corresponding department of the Second Department of the Normal College. Therefore, the previously issued Provisional Regulations for University Training of Middle School Teachers should be abolished immediately, and the Ministry has already ordered compliance.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education and Culture Association Collects Literature from the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>(Jinhua News) The Education and Culture Affairs Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee recently held a committee meeting and resolved to suggest to the Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee that a Zhejiang Provincial Collection Committee for Lost Literature from the Occupied Areas be established to be responsible for collecting lost literature. The original proposal stated that with the fall of western Zhejiang, there have been many losses of books both public and private within the province. Among them, there must be quite a few drawings and books that are important to the nation's cultural academics and inventions. Zhejiang Province is particularly the main cultural center of the southeast, and we are also moving forward to the great first step of the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction. We must fulfill our anti-Japanese defense responsibilities for the extension and development of national literature. It is proposed to advise the Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Collection Committee for Lost Literature from the Occupied Areas, with the standing committee member of the Provincial Anti-Japanese War Committee, the director of the Education Department, and the director of the Provincial Museum as ex officio members. The collection of lost literature should focus on important books and atlases related to national history and academic inventions. The scope of collection and storage methods will be properly discussed and formulated after the establishment of the committee.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Issue of Investing in the Southwest</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In the middle of last month, the Shanghai Banking and Financial Industry Friendship Association held a symposium to discuss investing in the Southwest. More than 20 people from the banking, financial, industrial, and commercial sectors attended. The editor, as an outsider, participated in the event and benefited greatly. The association originally intended to submit the minutes to this publication for disclosure, but due to the large amount of material, it was decided to have Mr. Wu, Mr. Hu, Mr. Shi, and Mr. Guan each take on a topic and complete this collective work. The four gentlemen are all economic experts and are very pessimistic about the future of Shanghai's economy. At the same time, they all see investing in the Southwest as the most reasonable way to adjust Shanghai's floating capital and industrial difficulties. Mr. Wu pointed out many of the reasons for past failures in investing in the Southwest, believing that the main reason was the availability of high profits in Shanghai. After calculating the current national policy, Mr. Shi believes that it is necessary to have a counter-prosperity policy. However, Mr. Hu and Mr. Guan pointed out that the prosperity of Shanghai and Hong Kong has come to an end, and high profits are waiting for capital to flow to the Southwest, but it must be combined with the means of production. As for the transfer of monetary funds, Mr. Wu believes that foreign exchange is the most suitable. These views can be said to be the biggest gains from the meeting's discussions. However, the editor believes that there is still a major issue that has not been resolved. That is, some people confuse investing in the Southwest with abandoning Shanghai. In the editor's personal opinion, this is a dangerous idea and should be considered carefully and thoroughly! Due to the sudden reduction in space in this issue, Mr. Guan's article has been temporarily withdrawn. We apologize for this.</p>
<h3>What Were the Root Causes in the Past?</h3>
<p>— Wu Hong'an</p>
<p>As early as a year ago, the slogan of investing in the Southwest was already being shouted enthusiastically; however, the execution in the past was not vigorous enough, and there were still many difficulties that needed to be resolved urgently in the process of implementation, and the results were very limited. Although there are many reasons, the ease of doing business and making big money in Shanghai cannot be said to be a fundamental obstacle.</p>
<p>After the war, Shanghai's import and export trade was very active, and the black market for foreign exchange was convenient due to the concentration of population and capital. Industry and commerce were very active, and profits were very generous. Although the normal outlets for the financial industry were narrower than before, the black market transactions and arbitrage of foreign exchange were profitable. Capital inevitably flows to the most profitable places and goes from the most familiar places. The inland is indeed a treasure trove, waiting to be developed everywhere, but it is still a virgin land after all. To get rich, you have to use your mind and take considerable risks. Shanghai is safe and profitable. Except for a very small number of capitalists with a strong sense of national consciousness and broad vision, who would be willing to give up making money in front of them and choose the distant one?</p>
<p>Second: Shanghai's industrial environment is also better than the inland. Eighty or ninety years of development have made Shanghai the most important modern economic center, with all kinds of large and small industries gathered together, and the connections and needs between factories are very well coordinated. In addition, the purchase of raw materials, the promotion of products, the facilities for warehousing, insurance, etc., the supply of power, the skills of workers, the prosperity of the financial industry, ... none of them are more convenient than in the inland. Looking back at the Southwest, the factories are scattered here and there, and the conditions of raw materials, workers, power, financial institutions, etc. are far worse than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Third: Inconvenient transportation and excessive transportation costs are also a major reason why manufacturers have not been able to relocate smoothly to the inland in the past. Shanghai's transportation to the Southwest now has to detour through Haiphong via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to reach the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. The transportation capacity of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is extremely small. How can a capacity of 100 tons per day cope with the goods pouring in from all over the southeast? Therefore, most of them are piled up. It is said that many manufacturers have transported their machinery to Haiphong, but there has been no news for half a year, and they cannot even find where the goods are. Transportation between various places in the Southwest, such as from Kunming to Chongqing, relies on highways, and the exorbitant highway freight is well known. When gasoline could be purchased for eight pennies a gallon, it was said that the freight from Shanghai via Haiphong to Kunming and then to Chongqing was 2,500 to 600 yuan per ton. Now, of course, it is even more expensive.</p>
<p>Fourth: The difficulty of transferring funds between the inland and Shanghai, that is, the exorbitant Shen exchange rate, is also a major obstacle to investing in the Southwest. The government restricts remittances from the inland to Shanghai, with the aim of preventing funds from escaping to Shanghai to buy foreign exchange. The principle is of course not objectionable. However, the funds remitted from the inland to Shanghai are of many types and different in nature. Some are the proceeds from the sale of goods in the inland by the industrial and commercial sectors, some are remittances from inland workers to their families in Shanghai, some are funds fleeing from the wealthy, and some are funds transferred from the inland to Shanghai for use by the financial sector. If the latter two types are treated the same as the former two, then once the proceeds from the goods of the industrial and commercial sectors enter the inland, they are in danger of being sealed off. Who would dare to have relations with the inland and then move to the inland to produce? If a Shanghai technician has to discount his wages by half before he can remit them out after arriving in the inland, then why should he bother to go to the inland to work hard? Therefore, the excessively strict restrictions on Shen exchange make it difficult for legitimate and illegitimate funds to flow, which is indeed a policy that urgently needs to be revised.</p>
<p>In addition, the obstruction of feudal forces in the inland and the bombing by Japanese planes everywhere are also reasons why people are not interested in investing in the Southwest. However, the bombing is no longer a major problem since the Trust Bureau has taken over the handling of the bombed areas.</p>
<p>Because of the above reasons, except for the hundreds of factories that were relocated with the assistance of the government in the early stages of the war and the few large industries newly established by several major banks in a few important cities in the Southwest after the war, Shanghai's achievements in investing in the Southwest in the past year and a half have been minimal.</p>
<p>As for the activities of the financial industry, they are based on the prosperity of the industry. In the Southwest, where there are few investment targets, the financial sector cannot achieve much. Many people believe that simply transporting a large amount of Shanghai's floating capital to the inland can achieve the goal of investing in the Southwest; however, they do not realize that a few legal tender notes cannot be considered capital, and simply transporting a part of the legal tender notes to the inland cannot be called an investment in the inland. Capital must be productive materials such as machinery, raw materials, etc., and only after turning the legal tender notes into such materials and making them active in the inland can it be considered an investment in the inland. Simply transferring legal tender notes to the inland without expanding productive forces will only plunge the inland into the abyss of inflation and will not have any other benefits. However, if the foreign exchange held by the general financial sector and the wealthy can be offered to the inland in an appropriate manner, it would be a powerful contribution, because foreign exchange is now China's most effective purchasing power for foreign countries and also a most valuable capital.</p>
<p>As for the government, although it has done a lot of work in promoting investment in the Southwest in the past, its efforts are still insufficient. It has not done its best to eliminate various obstacles for the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors in the inland, and it has not been vigorous enough in implementing various insurance, interest guarantees, subsidies, investigations, reporting, and other support and guidance work; in Shanghai, not only has it not adjusted and cracked down on various speculation and opportunism in a timely manner, but it has maintained the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai for a long time, allowing Shanghai's industry and commerce to prosper abnormally, which cannot but be said to be a major mistake of the government in the past.</p>
<p>Now, the black market for foreign exchange is no longer maintained, and the prosperity of industry and commerce is declining day by day. The government should take advantage of this change in the objective environment and implement appropriate policies: on the one hand, restrict Shanghai's economic activities, and on the other hand, open up broad avenues in the rear to integrate the resources and materials of the isolated island with the construction of the rear; then the various problems of investing in the Southwest in the past will sooner or later be gradually eliminated. Many people only know how to criticize capitalists for indulging in pleasure and putting the national crisis behind them; however, they do not understand that this is the result of the gathering of various objective forces, and the problem can only be solved after correcting the objective conditions.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Environment</h3>
<p>— Hu Chengwu</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Chinese government has worked hard to encourage investment in the Southwest, and many capitalists have also gone to the inland to prepare for development; however, what the government advocates is a hope or an ideal; what the capitalists pursue is huge profits or the appreciation of capital. The goals of the two sides are inconsistent and cannot be made consistent, so the development of the Southwest in the past has only become a slogan and cannot be said to have any effect.</p>
<p>Although China's current political and economic institutions still do not allow the state itself to be the owner of various industries, nor can it manage or order all the property or means of production of capitalists, the state has the power to control and can also arrange the environment in various aspects to make it suitable for the production conditions of capitalists; recently, the government has apparently worked hard on this and has already shown considerable results.</p>
<p>We know that the development of the Southwest is not a simple issue of capital inflow, but includes the transfer of many means of production. Because simply the inflow of capital, and the inability to arbitrarily purchase the means of production in the inland, is still impossible to engage in development; moreover, if the inland is only short of capital, government banks can create credit and provide accommodation, and there is no need to rely on capital from Shanghai or Hong Kong and other places: therefore, the issue of capital transfer raised from the standpoint of developing the Southwest really needs to be annotated, that is, capital must be transferred to the inland in the form of means of production.</p>
<p>This kind of transfer has encountered many difficulties and suffered great twists and turns in the past, but recently the environment has changed, many difficulties have been overcome, and the transfer of capital and means of production to the inland can of course be smoother than before.</p>
<p>The so-called change in the environment is twofold: on the one hand, the decline in prosperity in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places, and on the other hand, the improvement of the industrial environment in the inland.</p>
<p>First, from the first aspect: since the fall in the exchange rate of legal tender, prices in the Shanghai market have soared. According to the ordinary principle of prosperity, industry must be stimulated and developed; however, Shanghai has become an isolated island, and the economic exchange with the occupied areas is not close. From the standpoint of many industrialists in China, their national consciousness does not allow them to communicate economic relations with the occupied areas; and from the standpoint of Japanese industrialists, they are also unwilling to have Chinese capital share their forbidden fruits, so the prosperity of Shanghai relies only on the consumption expenses of Shanghai itself; after the exchange rate falls, the general purchasing power decreases, and Shanghai's productivity loses its large support force, so it is forced to reduce work or stop. Among them, textile factories or flour factories that use foreign products as raw materials suffer even greater blows; many capitals cannot obtain profits in industry, and naturally become floating capitals, floating on the market, so the wind of speculation is very prosperous, and hoarding is endless. However, speculation is like gambling. If one side wins huge profits, the other side will suffer great losses. Individual property may change greatly, but the total capital will never increase, so the road is not a legitimate way to make a profit and cannot be sustained; fortunately, there is still a way now, which is the way out for these floating capitals, and the future is very promising, that is, the development of the Southwest; therefore, since the fall in the exchange rate, investing in the Southwest has once again become the main topic of Shanghai industrialists.</p>
<p>As for the environment in Hong Kong, it is also similar to that in Shanghai. Since the fall of Guangzhou last year, the contact artery between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland has been cut off by Japan, so the economic situation in Hong Kong is similar to that in Shanghai after the occupation. The main thing is to rely on the consumption of refuge people to maintain its production and trade. At the same time, it uses its proximity to the Southwest to supply the inland with daily industrial products. However, since the fall in the exchange rate of legal tender, the Chinese refuge people have gradually felt the difficulty of life and have moved to the inland one after another; and the industrial products produced by Hong Kong's industry have also become expensive after being converted into legal tender and cannot be sold in the inland, so they have to stop working. In addition, the European situation is tense recently, and there is a possibility of the outbreak of war. If the war really happens, the UK may not be able to take care of the safety of Hong Kong because its reach is too long; and the Japanese army has taken the opportunity to occupy Shenzhen, threatening Kowloon, and claiming to lock up Hong Kong, so Hong Kong's industry has the need to move to a better place both economically and militarily, and their only way out is the mainland. Therefore, the transfer of capital and means of production from Hong Kong to the inland has been very prosperous recently. It is said that the deposits withdrawn from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Hong Kong totaled more than 20 million yuan in the week from August 20 to 26, so it had to restrict deposits and withdrawals to maintain itself; this fact is clear evidence of the inflow of capital and undoubtedly makes a great contribution to the development of the Southwest.</p>
<p>Looking at the industrial environment in the inland, although the government initially moved to the inland two years ago, it took the development of the Southwest as its main policy agenda, but because of the many political affairs, it did not have time to immediately establish a detailed plan, so it did not see any effect; however, after two years of hard work, the resources and products of various places have been finely investigated, and the development plan and direction have been specifically finalized. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economy, has published a paper stipulating the division between state-owned industries and private industries. The government will never compete with the people for profits in all industries that enrich the lives of the people in the inland and strengthen the country's anti-war forces; and it plans to do its best to support and encourage them in order to overcome various unfavorable conditions in the inland. At the same time, because the development of transportation is a prerequisite for the transfer of means of production, the Ministry of Communications has spared no effort in developing transportation routes. The completion of the Burma Road, the construction of the Burma Railway, the enrichment of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the connection of the Xiang-Gui and Gui-Yue railways are all the highest achievements in a short period of time. Recently, the Southwest Transportation Company has 2,000 military vehicles and has recruited 600 teachers to train technical personnel in transportation on a large scale, so the transportation capacity will definitely be greatly improved in the future. Although it is too early to say that this will solve all transportation problems, many difficulties that existed before can be overcome in the process of building the Southwest industry. In addition, the Ministry of Finance's encouragement of capital transfer to the inland, the restriction of remittances from the occupied areas, and the instruction of the Central Trust Bureau to handle all war risk insurance are all sufficient to guarantee the capital and safety of inland industries, and are also a very good catalyst for industrial transfer. Therefore, judging from the government's various facilities, the industrial environment in the inland has greatly improved, and it is indeed very different from before.</p>
<p>The changes in the environment on both sides have created a new situation, that is, the transfer of capital or industry has become the only way out for the people and private capital in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places. Not only can they directly obtain huge profits from this, but they can also indirectly contribute to the construction of the country's economic foundation, so except for those who have no national consciousness or are short-sighted, no industrialist or capitalist will hesitate.</p>
<h3>How Should the State Strive?</h3>
<p>— Shi Yiwen</p>
<p>Looking at the actual situation of the Southwest construction in the past, there are quite a few commendable places. Although it is still far from the actual needs and ideal goals, many wartime industries have been established in a short period of time, especially the transportation construction, which has achieved amazing results. However, we believe that what is regrettable is that Shanghai, which occupies the central position in China, has participated very little in this great cause. We do not deny that after the national army withdrew to the west, many of Shanghai's industries continued to move to the inland, but judging from the ratio (the number of relocations and the number of remaining in Shanghai), it is very small.</p>
<p>Why did so few of Shanghai's industries move to the inland? Of course, it is not because the industrialists in Shanghai do not love the country, but there are objective reasons.</p>
<p>First, because transportation in the inland is inconvenient, it is factually difficult to transport heavy machinery.</p>
<p>Second, they are not familiar with the situation in the inland, and they are not accustomed to the life there.</p>
<p>Third, the relocation costs are huge, which ordinary industrial capital cannot afford, and the government has no specific assistance methods.</p>
<p>Fourth, industries have mutual links. If industry A cannot move, industry B has to adopt the policy of following suit.</p>
<p>Fifth, many industrial raw materials are not easy to obtain in the inland; certain industrial products cannot be sold in the inland.</p>
<p>Sixth, there is a risk of bombing in the inland, which is not as safe as Shanghai.</p>
<p>The above reasons are indeed the difficulties in the internal relocation of Shanghai's industry. However, what we want to point out here is that this is not the most fundamental reason. The most fundamental reason is: "There are high profits to be made in Shanghai." Because there are high profits to be made in Shanghai, even if the industrialists generally understand that their business should be relocated internally, they are ultimately lured by the "high profits" and are reluctant to leave. Capital flows to profitable areas, which is an iron rule of capitalist economics, and national consciousness cannot defeat it.</p>
<p>If the reluctance of Shanghai's industry to stay in Shanghai only affects the economic construction of the Southwest and does not harm the future of the nation, then it is not something that is worthy of attention. But the fact is not the case. Because:</p>
<p>First, the development of Shanghai's industry absorbs a lot of capital and a large number of industrial technicians, which is obviously an obstacle to the economic construction of the Southwest.</p>
<p>Second, because transportation between Shanghai and the inland is inconvenient, Shanghai's supply of materials to the inland is in fact very little possible. On the contrary, due to:</p>
<p>Third, its geographical proximity to the occupied areas, it has a closer economic exchange relationship with the occupied areas than with the inland: therefore, it makes Shanghai's economic relationship with the inland increasingly estranged and becomes a supporter of a certain policy.</p>
<p>Fourth, due to the development of Shanghai's industry, a large number of foreign goods are imported, resulting in a huge trade deficit, which puts a heavy burden on the legal tender, weakens China's economic power, and endangers China's entire financial structure.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the industrial development of Shanghai not only indirectly prevents the development of the economic construction of the Southwest, but also directly endangers China's entire wartime economic organization, posing a huge threat to China.</p>
<p>But how to make Shanghai's industry move to the inland? Simply promoting it in words, or setting up subsidy and insurance and other incentive methods to persuade, will not have a practical effect: because industrialists "have high profits to be made in Shanghai", so they will not go to the inland automatically.</p>
<p>Then, the basic fact that caused Shanghai industrialists to have high profits in the past was undoubtedly the government's willingness to maintain the black market for foreign exchange and the Shanghai market at the cost of great sacrifice. This policy should be reconsidered immediately!</p>
<p>Although, since June 7, the government's policy has changed somewhat, it is not thorough enough. Although Shanghai is not as prosperous as it used to be, there is still blood-sucking and speculative opportunities; of course: implementing a counter-prosperity policy in the Shanghai market may be subject to many diplomatic and political constraints, but if you see the poison and are afraid to have surgery, it will harm the whole body. Put it to death and then live, this is the only effective way to deal with the numb!</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Cash Black Market Plummets, Falling Nearly 100 Yuan Compared to the Previous Day's Unofficial Price</h3>
<p>The cash black market plummeted yesterday due to the Monday holiday, so there was no official market price. It is said that the day before yesterday (9th) afternoon, because of speculative bulls, in view of the two-day consecutive decline in gold prices, took advantage of the foreign exchange holiday on Saturday afternoon, they fabricated something out of nothing, and spread rumors that foreign exchange would change again on Monday, and that the central government would allow foreign exchange to fluctuate freely, etc. At the same time, they raised the price sharply to the 4,000 yuan mark. Large gold shops quoted 400 yuan per gram, and new shops quoted 398 yuan, but because most operators did not believe the above news, they took the opportunity to sell high, and the price fell. At noon, the purchase price at the money exchange shops was 3,880 yuan, and the selling price was 3,920 yuan, a drop of nearly 100 yuan compared to the previous day's unofficial price.</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was 400 yuan by the large shops. Until 9:45, it was reduced by five yuan. The large shops then changed to 395 yuan, and the new shops to 393 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 9th: The price of British pure gold remains fixed at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Declines</h3>
<p>Bombay, 9th: The spot price of Indian silver suddenly declined by ten annas, to 56 rupees and 08 annas. Futures for September and October also declined by sixteen annas, to 56 rupees. A total of 100 contracts were traded. The market was flat. No reports have been received from the British and American silver markets.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, sugar prices have soared in recent days due to problems with the source of supply. Not only are people in the industry paying attention, but people outside the industry are also兼营, so the trading of sugar has a speculative feeling. Yesterday, the guild's settlement price rose even more sharply, with the increase reaching as much as six or seven yuan. The initial price of 24 crude white in the main warehouse was 61 yuan, and then rose to 63 yuan and 30 cents. The price in the outer warehouse was 60 yuan and 20 cents to 63 yuan, and the price of re-export was 50 yuan. The price of Taikoo granulated white B mark rose from 65 yuan directly to 70 yuan. The remaining marks followed suit. The current price of H mark and red mark was 52 yuan and 50 cents. The price of Dutch red spot was 52 yuan to 54 yuan, and the price of re-export was 44 yuan. The price of the number 1 native soft white was 63 yuan, the price of native rock sugar was 70 yuan, the price of Jingming rock sugar was 71 yuan and 50 cents, and the price of national sugar coarse blue also soared by about five yuan, opening at 40 yuan (cash), and 400 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Billets Reach the 100 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The long-silent black iron billets have soared along with other goods since the outbreak of the European war. However, the rate of increase is only half that of other goods. Only in the last two days have toy factories, thermos bottle factories, printing factories, and printing plants in this street all made purchases, and the largest sales volume is still among general囤戶, with hundreds of担 going in and out every day. The holders' psychology has become昂, and the standard has also been喊高不已, from 75 yuan, to 80 yuan, to 90 yuan, until yesterday, the last selling plate has been喊 to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Hainan New Longan Meat - Up Another Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Hainan new longan meat, when the price was reduced before, the customer held on to the goods that had not been兑 due to cost considerations. Yesterday, some continued to open, and the price rose another five yuan compared to before, and it has been scarce recently, so the trend is extremely firm.</p>

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Police Build Roads Beyond the Border; Continue to Seize Two Houses Yesterday; Puppet Police Establish Branch Office on Avenue Joffre; Concession Police Continue to Perform Duties</h3>
<p>In the areas beyond the Shanghai West Concession where roads are being built, such as Avenue Joffre and Yu Yuan Road, Japanese troops and puppet police have been frequently moving about recently. However, the concession police officers in those areas are still performing their duties as usual, so the concession's police authority remains normal. Since the puppet police arbitrarily moved into the Tzu Lien No. 31 Refugee Shelter the day before yesterday, several other locations were targeted yesterday. For example, puppet police went to the staff dormitory of a certain bank near the Jing'an Temple Road and Di Feng Road, intending to take up residence there. The concession authorities are paying close attention to the recent situation in Shanghai West. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Prepare Cautiously as Situation Develops</p>
<p>For days, the situation in Shanghai West has been tense due to the frequent movements of Japanese and puppet troops. Residents, not understanding the reason, inevitably made many speculations, leading to a sudden state of unease. The Japanese and puppet troops often moved in without the consent of the homeowners. Yesterday, it was learned that both concessions, with the imminent approach of the "September 18th Incident" anniversary, decided to implement special precautions starting yesterday to ensure order and peace within the concessions. Additional detectives have been stationed at all key intersections, and close defense has been established especially in areas bordering the Chinese-controlled areas of Shanghai West. These precautions within the two concessions will be lifted after the "September 18th Incident." As for the precautions in the areas beyond the Shanghai West Concession, it is said that measures will be adapted at any time depending on the needs of the situation.</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency who conducted an on-site inspection in the Shanghai West area yesterday afternoon, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Inspect Orphanage Middle School</p>
<p>The afternoon before yesterday, at 4 p.m., Japanese and puppet troops invaded the Tzu Lien Branch No. 31 Refugee Shelter on Avenue Joffre, which is beyond the concession's road construction area, and expelled all the "Si Ge" (private watchmen) from the lanes on Avenue Joffre. Upon receiving the report, the British Defense Force Headquarters immediately dispatched a troop of soldiers to conduct a security watch across from the shelter. The British army was ordered to retreat, and the situation eased. In the evening, the Japanese and puppet troops withdrew the majority of their forces, leaving only a dozen or so people behind. After 10 p.m., two Japanese officers suddenly entered the orphanage middle school inside the shelter, supposedly for inspection. Staff members of the school accompanied them on a tour of the school grounds. The two Japanese officers asked who was sponsoring the school and the source of the students. The staff explained that it was sponsored by various charitable organizations and that the students were refugee children recommended by various shelters. They also asked why the students' clothing was so neat even though they were refugee children. The staff informed them that they were gifts from various charitable organizations. The two Japanese officers then left without further comment.</p>
<p>Solid Fortifications Rebuilt Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Japanese and puppet troops increased their numbers by more than thirty people, and they dismantled and rebuilt the temporary fortifications that had been piled up in front of the gate. What was originally built in front of the gate was now moved to both sides of the gate, presumably to facilitate the entry and exit of vehicles. A Japanese officer supervised the construction on-site, which seemed more solid than before, indicating that they had no intention of withdrawing.</p>
<p>Two Houses Continue to be Invaded</p>
<p>The houses that continued to be occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops yesterday morning included: (1) Qiuyuan at No. 15 Avenue Joffre and the Maosheng Kang Ji Lumber Company (next door to the west of the shelter), where a puppet police station was set up. (2) A staff dormitory of a certain bank at No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road (near Di Feng Road). More than 40 staff members lived there. Yesterday morning around 8 a.m., four or five puppet police officers suddenly arrived at the door of the building and posted a notice, stating that the bank staff should leave quickly so that the building could be used as an office. At 8:45 a.m., more than a dozen puppet police and Japanese military police arrived and demanded to take over the entire dormitory. Four armed Japanese military police, armed with rifles and live ammunition, were stationed at the dormitory entrance. A group of puppet police and Japanese military police entered and searched the building. At that time, two passenger cars belonging to the bank for transporting staff were parked at the entrance. Fortunately, the puppet police signaled and the drivers understood, so they drove towards Jing'an Temple Road to avoid being detained. The staff members negotiated with the puppet police for a long time, but to no avail. The staff then prepared to move out. Although there are Japanese troops stationed at the entrance, staff members are still free to enter and exit.</p>
<p>Key Points Occupied by Japanese and Puppet Troops</p>
<p>In addition, reporters saw that at the entrances of Siming Villa on Yu Yuan Road and Zhongshi New Village, there were seven or eight puppet police officers armed with guns stationed. It was heard that starting at 8 p.m. every day, residents were prohibited from entering or leaving. At the intersection of Kena Road, which is beyond the concession's road construction area on the west end of Siming Villa, there were also more than a dozen Japanese and puppet troops stationed. It was heard that the "Si Ge" (private watchmen) from the lanes on Yu Yuan Road were also expelled yesterday. Near the Kangjia Bridge on Avenue Joffre, puppet police have also been deployed at posts. By this point, it can be said that the key points of the Shanghai West road construction area beyond the concession have been completely controlled by the Japanese army as of yesterday. In front of the headquarters of the Japanese military police and the puppet police station on Avenue Joffre, defensive fortifications have been built since yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai West Police Officers Performing Their Duties as Usual</p>
<p>The section from Avenue Joffre to Caojiadu was previously patrolled by police vehicles dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, and their presence could be seen in the Wujiaochang area. Since yesterday, they have disappeared without a trace. When reporters passed by the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, they saw three police vehicles that were responsible for patrolling the area parked near the Yu Yuan Road Post Office. However, the patrol officers who originally held positions in the Shanghai West area were still stationed and performing their duties as usual yesterday. There was no interference from the Japanese and puppet police in the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. In areas such as Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road, reporters did not see large numbers of Japanese and puppet troops stationed, but according to residents, Japanese and puppet troops patrolled day and night, in groups of seven or eight or more than ten people, but there were no other movements.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, while the attention of local people is focused on the war reports of Poland's development, the Japanese are plotting to</p>
<p>Control Shanghai</p>
<p>This morning (the 10th) they went a step further. Several trucks carrying armed Da Dao (Great Way) police and Japanese military police reinforced the Da Dao police who had taken over the police stations in the Avenue Joffre area yesterday (the 9th). All of these people were equipped with rifles and bayonets, waiting for orders. In the two police stations on Avenue Joffre,</p>
<p>Da Dao police in military uniform and armed with guns gathered, and another police station was full of Japanese military police. The Da Dao police are also stationed at the police stations on Kena Road and Kang Nao Wan Road, but there is no action to take over other long-disputed extraterritorial roads, such as Yu Yuan Road, Bailinan Road, Daxilu, and Kaixuan Road. It is verified that the area is part of the British military defense zone, and the Public Concession police continue to patrol the area.</p>
<p>British Soldiers Inspected Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the "Da Dao" puppet police who invaded the Shanghai West road construction area beyond the concession have not shown any intention of withdrawing. Therefore, the tension caused by the local area still exists. At around 7:30 a.m. yesterday morning, the British army garrison near Di Feng Road sent two trucks loaded with British soldiers to conduct an on-site inspection in front of the Tzu Lien No. 31 shelter on Avenue Joffre, which was partially occupied by the puppet police. However, after the British army arrived at the scene, the Japanese military police unit stationed nearby also dispatched a squad of Japanese soldiers to the 31st shelter to assist the puppet police. Therefore, the British soldiers stayed for a short time and then returned in their vehicles.</p>
<h3>Nationals of Warring Countries in Shanghai Maintain Calm Minds; Collectively Seek to Adjust Emotions to Cope with the Crisis; Shared Hardship During the Shanghai War Two Years Ago</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times states that Shanghai is an international city with people from all over the world. There has never been a greater need for foreigners to restrain their emotions and think calmly than in the past seven days. A week ago, Britain and France successively declared the existence of a state of war with Germany, and the emotions of the World War that broke out 25 years ago naturally resurfaced. However, in recent days, nationals of the warring countries have concluded that mutual hostile actions are of no benefit. Since the beginning of last week, nationals of various countries in this city have repeatedly expressed their ability to maintain a calm mind even in the most critical times. Today (the 10th) marks one week since Britain, France, and Poland declared war on Germany. It is unpredictable whether more countries will eventually be drawn into the vortex of war. However, there are many nationals of the four major warring countries residing in this city. They are forced to stay here, and many of them are eager to join their country's army and serve as volunteers, but only a few have been able to leave Shanghai for active duty. It is surprising that only one unfortunate incident has occurred among the nationals of the warring countries in Shanghai in the past week. According to a foreigner who has lived in Shanghai for a long time, Shanghai has become accustomed to disturbances, and its citizens have experienced many political upheavals and dangers, so they are better able to adjust their emotions to cope with crises than citizens of other cities in the world. Now, the nationals of the warring countries remember defending their mutual interests in Shanghai shoulder to shoulder during the Shanghai War two years ago. Even if the governments of European countries are at odds, this unique bond and emotion is not easily forgotten. In the past week, the nationals of the four countries in Shanghai—Britain, France, Poland, and Germany—have had to readjust</p>
<p>Their relationships. British nationals of military service age volunteer to serve their country, but the British authorities have instructed them to stay in Shanghai to continue business and to be summoned when needed. French reservists have been called up and will depart for their country at any time. The German authorities have instructed German nationals on what duties they will perform in the future. Polish nationals have also received instructions. There are also many young men of other nationalities who are willing to serve the British and French governments, but the authorities have advised them to wait and see how things develop. In general, in the past week, Shanghai, apart from being more restricted in commerce and having underlying anxieties, has had little noticeable reaction to the tragic developments in Europe. What the situation will be next week and in the future is what the general foreign community in Shanghai will calmly and firmly await.</p>
<h3>Speculation by Cargo Owners Leads to Sharp Rise in Prices of Imported Goods; Abundant Stocks of Hardware and Dyes; Soaring Paper Prices Affect Culture</h3>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War, the prices of imported goods from Europe and the United States had already risen significantly due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Since the outbreak of the German-Polish War, the stimulus to prices in Shanghai has been profound. As a result, the prices of various imported goods in Shanghai have risen irregularly in the past ten days. In reality, the European war has not expanded, and shipping between the Mediterranean and the Far East has not been interrupted. The biggest reason is that those who own the goods are hoarding and speculating, deliberately manipulating the market, causing prices to change rapidly and continue to rise. In practice, stocks of goods in Shanghai such as hardware, dyes, and wool fabrics are quite substantial. However, the owners are unwilling to sell, waiting for a better price, which has led to the current situation. According to news from the hardware industry, the prices of some hardware products have continued to rise several times over in the past week. For example, a 100-pound barrel of foreign nails has now risen to 60 yuan, and some are even asking for 70 or 80 yuan. Before the German-Polish War, it was only about 30 yuan per barrel. The same is true for dyes. The soaring price of paper these days is also particularly alarming. According to yesterday's market prices, each ream of newspaper has risen to 26 yuan, and each pound of Daolin paper has risen to 6 jiao, with a continued upward trend. The sharp rise in paper prices has had a significant impact on the cultural and educational sectors.</p>
<h3>Italian Mail Ship Seeks Profit, Sets Sail for Europe on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Eurasia route of the Italian Mail Ship Company's, the Conte Verde line, which was supposed to come to Shanghai on the 28th of last month, was changed to the Giulio Cesare, which sails on the North African line. After the ship arrived in port, it stayed in Shanghai awaiting orders because war had broken out in Europe. After the Italian government stated its position a few days ago, the ship received a telegram from the head office ordering it to return to Europe. The Shanghai office immediately handled the procedures for loading cargo and selling passenger tickets. Due to the lack of ships traveling from Shanghai to Europe, passengers and cargo were jammed. The ship was the first to go to Europe after the worsening of the situation in Europe, so cargo was unusually congested and all procedures were not easy to handle, so it was postponed again. It is now known that it has been decided to set sail for export on the morning of the 14th, and passengers must board the ship on the evening of the 13th. The small shuttle boat prepared by the company for picking up passengers has not decided whether to depart from the Custom House pier at 8 p.m. on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Consolidates Legal Tender, Shanghai Financial Market Stabilizes, Foreign Exchange Trends Stabilize, Bond Prices Rise, All Sectors Transfer Assets to the Interior to Develop Industries</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced the outlines of measures to consolidate finance and the outlines of measures to improve central financial institutions in wartime, the four banks—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—formed a joint office, consolidated the basis for legal tender reserves, implemented open inspection, tried their best to stabilize foreign exchange, supplied legitimate needs as much as possible, absorbed social idle funds, completed the southwestern and northwestern financial networks, and strived to handle production enterprise loans. Therefore, China's finance will become healthier, and the Shanghai financial market has improved as a result. The black market for foreign exchange has stabilized and has gradually loosened compared to before, while the legal foreign exchange price of the Central Bank has remained unchanged. The black market for gold has fallen in price due to speculation by sellers, and the rise and fall of foreign currencies of various countries are not as drastic as in the past. Buyers in the black market for securities are quite active and prices have risen. The forward premium for remittances has not fluctuated much. Rumors in the market about finance and currency have ceased, and people's hearts have gradually become stable. All those who have capital are transferring assets to the southwest and northwest to assist the government in completing inland construction and developing various inland industries. The government is fully supporting the development of various production enterprises, so China's production enterprises will make rapid progress in the future. Recently, remittances from Shanghai to the interior have increased sharply, and banks are providing various conveniences and waiving remittance fees. All Shanghai payments for remittances or banknotes with place names such as Central, Communications, Tianjin, Shandong, Han, can be exchanged for full legal tender in the interior.</p>
<h3>Southwest Postal Transportation Develops, Continues to Recruit Postal Workers, Registration is Open Immediately and Ends at the End of the Month, Those Enrolled will be Sent to Serve in the Southwest</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation, in order to adapt to needs and develop postal services with the completion of the air and highway networks in the southwestern provinces and cities, ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to recruit more than 200 new postal workers in the spring of this year, to give them six months of training, and to rotate them through various bureaus for internships. The first and second batches were dispatched to various highway post offices in the provinces and cities of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Hunan at the beginning of this month, and more than 100 people will depart in the near future. It is learned that the Ministry believes that there is a great need for postal talent in these provinces and cities, and the personnel recruited in the previous decision are still insufficient to be deployed. The Ministry has ordered the Director of the Bureau, Mr. Zha Pei Lin, to continue to recruit more than 200 junior postal workers. The Bureau, in compliance with the Ministry's instructions, issued a public notice yesterday, stating that due to the continued need for junior postal workers in inland postal districts, the Bureau has been ordered to hold a junior postal worker examination.

<h3>Restaurant Industry Finds Solution for Small Change Shortage, Association Issues Substitute Vouchers, Fish Industry Recalls Substitute Vouchers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, because Juxing Restaurant was forced to close due to a lack of small change and other members have asked for a remedy for this difficulty, has printed two types of substitute vouchers, one fen and five fen, in order to relieve the current problem of change shortage. It notified its members yesterday, stating that due to the lack of copper coins in the market, it is difficult to find small change, and asked to issue substitute vouchers to seek relief. Once the national government issues small denomination subsidiary coins, the association will collect them back at their face value. Therefore, it plans to print one fen and five fen vouchers, and hopes that each industry will prepare funds to collect and use them to facilitate the small change for refugee donations. If the industry believes it is necessary, they must first send a letter applying for a certain amount of fractional vouchers in order to proceed. This is to notify you. Also, Da Tong Company issued a notice yesterday, stating that "Due to the lack of copper coins in the market, it is very difficult to find small change for buying and selling. In order to facilitate the industry and fishmongers, a one-fen temporary substitute voucher has been printed for use. Unexpectedly, some lawless people dared to counterfeit them, harming users and committing serious crimes. In addition to sending staff to conduct a thorough investigation, the temporary substitute voucher will be recalled uniformly, limited to September 30th. Anyone holding a one-fen temporary substitute voucher from Da Tong Fish Industry Company, please exchange it for legal currency at the company as soon as possible. This is a notice."</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Mobile Unit: Active Along the Jinghu Line; Surrender of Puppet Troops at the Junction of Suzhou and Changzhou; Thorough Excavation of Highway Culverts Overnight</h3>
<p>The highest authorities of the Jiangnan Mobile Unit, since deciding to advance the × Route Army eastward, several months have passed, encountering numerous hardships. Its vanguard troops recently progressed from the Japanese defense zone to Qingpu. Around Liuhe, Luodian, and the Wusong River, there were engagements with Japanese troops. The battles of Luodian and the Wusong River were the fiercest. When the vanguard of the × Detachment approached Weidian, it was discovered by Japanese spies, who reported it to the Japanese military. The Japanese then dispatched over two hundred soldiers to encircle the vanguard troops. The two sides immediately opened fire. Fortunately, the Chinese rear guard arrived in time, and the Japanese were forced to flee in all directions. In this battle, over eighty Japanese soldiers were killed, and over fifty rifles were seized. The fierce fighting lasted for three hours. According to a certain company commander who participated in the battle, the Luodian battle was the most intense since the eastward advance. The situation at the time was extremely critical, beyond the reach of rifle power. Even machine guns, normally advantageous in storming positions, were abandoned. Hand grenades were used instead, demonstrating the intensity of the fighting. It was reported that on the 28th of last month, a Japanese-hired steamer towing seven civilian boats was sailing upstream near Yujidun on the Wusong River. When it reached a certain point, two civilian boats were sunk by the mobile unit on the shore. Over fifty Japanese soldiers also died. The Japanese never retaliated, fleeing in panic. Recently, guerrilla warfare has become extremely common in the suburbs of Shanghai. However, the number of Japanese casualties is kept secret, and news is delayed, so outsiders rarely know the details.</p>
<p>Resolution of Puppet Troops in the Western Suburbs of Wuxi</p>
<p>According to someone from Suzhou, the Jiangnan Mobile Unit in the three counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, on this month's [illegible] day, early in the morning, dispatched a unit of over two hundred soldiers from the × Detachment of the × Route Army to attack the stronghold of the puppet army led by Gu Fuxing outside the West Gate of Wuxi, seven li away. Within twenty minutes, the stronghold was completely resolved. It is estimated that over twenty puppet soldiers died, and battalion commander Fan was also killed on the spot. Over thirty were captured alive, and over twenty short guns and over thirty rifles were seized. Because the location was quite close to the city, the Japanese army in the city, upon hearing the alarm, urgently dispatched a battalion to reinforce. By the time they reached the destination, the mobile unit had already withdrawn.</p>
<p>Major Victory for Chinese Army at the Junction of Suzhou and Changzhou</p>
<p>In retaliation, the Japanese and puppet troops did not hesitate to mobilize a large army, dispatching two hundred Japanese soldiers and over five hundred puppet soldiers, with the puppet soldiers as the vanguard. They also carried heavy weapons such as small mortars, hired a motorboat towing five civilian boats, and advanced. When they approached Weijingtang at the junction of Suzhou and Changzhou and disembarked, they were spotted by the × Route Army sentries, who rushed back to report. More than three hundred soldiers of the × Detachment, who had combat experience, were sent to intercept them. Taking advantage of the fact that they had not completely landed, they surrounded them and shouted, "Drop your weapons, we are our own people!" The Japanese and puppet troops were caught off guard and unable to respond. As a result, over three hundred puppet soldiers who had landed surrendered completely. Seeing the situation was not good, the Japanese opened full throttle and fired small mortars, fleeing while firing. In this battle, not a single soldier was injured or killed, achieving a great victory. They also seized two heavy machine guns, five light machine guns, two hundred and sixteen rifles, over ten pistols, and seven boxes of ammunition. Over three hundred surrendered puppet soldiers who volunteered to join the army were transferred to the rear for training. Those who did not wish to join the army had their names registered and were given five yuan each for travel expenses.</p>
<p>Blockaded Culverts Enrage Farmers</p>
<p>The Japanese army, suffering a great loss in the Weijingtang battle, could not suppress its hatred. Therefore, it changed its strategy, adopting a method of cutting off the water supply at the source. Because there were many bridges and culverts on the waterways, making it easy for the mobile unit to ambush, they completely blocked all the culverts along the hundred-plus li of the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway. However, farmers relied entirely on the culverts for irrigation. Now that they were completely blocked by the Japanese and puppet troops, it was no different from cutting off the farmers' livelihoods. In anger, they rushed to report to the Jiangnan Mobile Unit headquarters, demanding prompt relief to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou. The highest authorities of the headquarters summoned political and training personnel and, at night, dispatched the entire team, calling on and automatically participating in the labor of over a thousand farmers, working through the night to excavate all the culverts that had been blocked by the Japanese army, and completely destroying the bridges and roads, disrupting transportation. It is reported that they had only recently been repaired.</p>
<p>Contacts in Fushan and Baidu</p>
<p>After completing this task, for the sake of a permanent solution, the mobile unit searched along the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway. Unexpectedly, when they reached Xushu, they encountered Japanese troops being transferred back to Changshu. The two sides immediately opened fire, engaging in a fierce battle for about an hour. Over forty Japanese soldiers were captured alive, and one light machine gun and over fifty rifles were seized. There have been recent contacts in Fushan, which belongs to Changshu, and Baidu, which belongs to Suzhou. The Japanese army is overwhelmed, because the Japanese troops in the occupied areas are sparse and cannot be dispatched, and they are already exhausted.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Occurs in the West of Qibao</p>
<p>At lunchtime on the second of this month, gunshots suddenly erupted in the west of Qibao for about ten minutes and stopped. The nearby villagers mistakenly believed that the Japanese army had come to the village to search, and everyone was panicked, fleeing without anywhere to go. According to a visitor from west Shanghai, it was learned that the gunfire was caused by a misunderstanding between the guerrilla unit led by Xu Xingzhou and the friendly unit led by Yao Youlian due to incorrect information. A certain informant used by Xu's unit had a long-standing feud with Yao. That day, he fabricated information based on his personal grudge. Commander Gu of the × Battalion believed it to be true, leading to this unfortunate conflict. Xu Xingzhou was a mid-level military officer in the former 45th Brigade. Last year, when the 45th Brigade was ordered to move west, Xu's unit did not follow, remaining in the west of Shanghai, and changed the banner to the × Detachment of the National Salvation Army. Now, after the 45th Brigade completed its training this spring and was reorganized into the New 30th Division, there is talk of them being ordered to reorganize the guerrillas in the Shangsongqing area. Xu also intends to join the New 30th Division. However, the units under Xu's command are quite complex and have not undergone rigorous training, so they will be extensively reorganized to become an elite force.</p>
<h3>Zhou Hua Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhou Hua, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, was recently arrested by the Japanese.

According to the Japanese-language "Continental New Report," Zhou came to Shanghai to join the Huadong News Agency, attempting to use his position to get close to Japanese reporters. However, the news agency denied yesterday that there was anyone named Zhou among its staff. It is still kept secret how the Japanese will deal with Zhou after his arrest.</p>

<h3>Case of Father An Murdered; Perpetrator Surrenders; Named Ju Bailu; Has Been Suspended by the Church; Also Claims Main Culprit, A Mu Lin, Has Fled</h3>
<p>Father An, a French national and director of the orphanage of the Tushanwan Catholic Church in Xujiahui, French Concession, was suddenly murdered in his bedroom upstairs in the orphanage at around 5:00 PM on the 30th of last month. Many days have passed, and after a thorough investigation by the French police, Ju Bailang, a key suspect in the case, knowing that it was unavoidable, surrendered to the French police at 9:10 PM the night before (the 9th), admitting to being an accessory to the murder of Father An. He claimed that the main culprit, A Mulin, was on the run, and that there were five people who carried out the murder, etc. The police are currently conducting a strict investigation of the suspect. According to the "News Agency Reporter," the criminal Ju Bailang is 25 years old and currently lives at No. 7, Ciyou Street, Refugee Zone, Xujiahui. It is heard that the criminal Ju's parents were originally Catholics and have both passed away. When Ju was young, he was raised by the church and, when he became an adult, was introduced to work in the printing room of the Tushanwan Church. Usually, according to church regulations, Catholics can receive a subsidy of 20 yuan when they get married. This spring, when Ju got married, he repeatedly requested this from Father An, but because Ju's conduct was improper, he had been suspended and therefore was not entitled to this marriage subsidy. Afterwards, Ju was extremely dissatisfied with Father An and often made threatening remarks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that Father An, a French national and director of the orphanage craft factory established by the Tushanwan Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Shanghai, was suddenly murdered in his bedroom on the 30th of last month. The murderer escaped from the scene, and the French police dispatched investigators and offered a reward for his capture. Suddenly, at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, Ju Bolu, a 25-year-old native of Pudong, residing at No. 7, Ziyou Street, Refugee Zone, Xujiahui, went to the French police station and declared that he was an accessory to the murder of Father An, a French national and director of the orphanage craft factory of the Tushanwan Catholic Church. He also confessed that the main culprit was nicknamed A Mulin, and that there were a total of five accomplices at the time of the murder. He admitted that he helped to hold down Father An's feet at the time. Based on his confession, the police chief immediately detained him and transferred him to the Criminal Section of the General Police Station for investigation by Chinese and Western detectives. A strict investigation is currently underway to arrest the fugitive accomplices.</p>
<h3>Beating to Death; Three Arrested by Japanese Troops; Immediately Handed Over to Huishan Police Station</h3>
<p>The "Zi Lin News" reports that Morrison, a 36-year-old Englishman from the Zhoushan Road branch of the Engineering Department of the Municipal Council, accompanied by interpreter Li Yanmin (transliteration) and a Jewish interpreter, went to the residence of Chinese Ding Xiuchun (transliteration) in Yangshupu for a matter at 2:30 AM yesterday (the 9th). Suddenly, they had an argument with Ding and fought each other. Ding was beaten to death by Li Yanmin, resulting in all three being arrested and detained by the Japanese military authorities in Yangshupu. Upon hearing the news, the Police Department demanded their transfer and finally handed them over to the Huishan Police Station together late last night.</p>
<p>The French "Shanghai Daily" reported on the 10th that a certain foreign employee of the Health Department of the Public Concession and a Jewish refugee, along with a Chinese man, were arrested by Japanese soldiers in Hongkou last night. It is also reported that these three Chinese and foreign individuals were staying at the home of a certain Chinese man residing on Baker Road and had a dispute. The Chinese man was then assassinated, at 2:30 PM. The servant of the Chinese man reported this to the nearby Japanese military station, so the Japanese soldiers detained the three. It is now heard that the Public Concession police will request the extradition of these three people, but the Japanese side has refused the request because the case occurred within the Japanese military defense zone.</p>
<h3>Frequent Fires in Hongkou; Japanese Troops on High Alert</h3>
<p>The "News Agency" reports that, according to a Japanese announcement, certain individuals have infiltrated the Japanese military and police defense zone in Hongkou, attempting to set fire to the wharves, warehouses, and ships, disrupting order. Therefore, starting at 2:00 PM yesterday, Japanese troops were dispatched to take emergency precautions, deploying defenses on Yangshupu Broadway Road, Hongkou Small Vegetable Market, North Sichuan Road, and Wenjianshi Road. They implemented strict inspections of passing vehicles and pedestrians, and conducted thorough interrogations. They also searched the households near the Osaka and Huangpu wharves, but it is reported that they found nothing.</p>
<h3>Public Organizations Concerned About People's Livelihood; Hoping Landlords Will Not Take the Opportunity to Raise Rents; Will Jointly Send Letters to All Levels of Courts; To Pay Attention to Landlord Rent Increase Cases</h3>
<p>Several public organizations in this city, considering that the prices of everything have skyrocketed recently, and life is generally difficult for the public, some landlords, without understanding the greater good, are taking the opportunity to coerce rent increases, even threatening to cut off water and electricity, resulting in lawsuits. They believe that these incidents are of great importance to the livelihood of citizens and the order and stability of the area. Based on the responsibility of social organizations to maintain local stability and people's morale, they will jointly send letters to the courts of the two special districts and the Jiangsu Higher Second and Third Branch Courts, requesting them to pay attention to lawsuits concerning housing issues and not allow landlords to achieve their rent increase goals through coercive means. It is heard that the official document will be sent out within days.</p>
<h3>Fufeng Flour Factory Experiences Labor Unrest; Nine Workers Arrested; Sent to Court on Charges of Intimidation; Arising from Workers' Demand for Wage Increase</h3>
<p>The Fufeng Flour Factory on Moganshan Road, West Shanghai, currently has over eight hundred workers, working day and night in shifts. Recently, due to the soaring price of rice and the high cost of living, they believed that their original wages were difficult to maintain. Therefore, on the evening of the 7th, they planned to take action with the management. When Shi Zhuojiang, the factory's worker manager, heard about this, he immediately gathered the workers for a conversation, hoping to quell the brewing labor unrest. However, the conversation ended in a breakdown.</p>
<p>That evening, the factory dismissed nineteen workers and notified the other workers to continue working as usual. The next morning, the dismissed workers gathered outside the factory gate and prevented those going to work from entering. In a short time, laborers gathered like bees outside the factory gate, and the noise and commotion rose up. The factory executives were unable to mediate and reported it to the Putuo Road police station by telephone. West Police Chief Huasheng led Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Zhu Jiahong, Ding Yulin, Sun Benchang, Gui Ziyuan, Zhang Fenglin, Tong Yongxiao, Yang Zezhi, Wang Yunsheng, Cao Tinghong, and other nine workers from northern Anhui. The rest scattered and fled. However, since the 8th, the factory's work has been at a standstill due to the labor unrest. The nine arrested were sent to the First Special District Local Court on Saturday morning (the 9th), where police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public lawsuit based on Article 304 of the Criminal Code for intimidation. Lawyer Qian explained the situation at the time and said that the workers' request for a wage increase was not a legitimate request. They immediately gathered a crowd, attempting to incite a strike. A detailed investigation is still required, and there are still five ringleaders at large. Therefore, he requested a postponement. Then Shi Zhuojiang arrived in court and explained the details of his negotiations with the workers. After Judge Meng questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>

<h3>Case of Deceased Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Dai Shoufan's Wife and Concubines in Litigation; Both First Wife and Second Concubine Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>After the death of Dai Shoufan, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from Fujian, who was over sixty years old, at his residence at No. 12, Tingyun Li, Lafayette Road, on July 12th of this year, the disagreement between his wife and concubines deepened. On the 2nd of last month, his third concubine, Dai Li, and his second concubine, Dai Zhou, stole a leather suitcase. The French police subsequently filed a lawsuit against Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou for theft based on Dai Li's accusation. Qiu and Zhou hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to defend them, insisting that Dai Li had fabricated the accusation. After Judge Huang Yan clarified the case, he ruled yesterday that Dai Qiu and Dai Zhou were both not guilty.</p>
<h3>Headmaster of Juxun Elementary School; Case of Double Appointment; Involved in Public Court Litigation; Adjourned for Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Juxun Elementary School, located at No. 32, Cihou South Li, Hartung Road, was founded in the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic of China by Cao Zhinian, also known as Cao Ziying (31 years old this year), who served as headmaster. He was able to fulfill his responsibilities in educating children and was highly praised by the Municipal Education Bureau. In recent years, the internal equipment has become increasingly complete, and there are hundreds of students. Recently, a man named Chen Binzhang filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Cao of embezzling the school. Cao hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to defend him. The case has been ruled by Judge Huang Risheng to suspend the trial. Chen then filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court, requesting confirmation that he was the headmaster of Juxun Elementary School. Yesterday, Judge Gui Yu opened the court to summon and question Cao Zhinian, who was represented by lawyer Ma Junshuo, who said that the plaintiff had no connection with Juxun Elementary School. There is a lot of written evidence that can be used as a reference in court. When the court questioned the plaintiff, Chen Binzhang, he had no evidence. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered that the case be postponed until the plaintiff paid the litigation fees.</p>
<h3>Woman Intends to Renounce Marriage; Man Requests Fulfillment of Marriage Contract</h3>
<p>Yu Cheng, a 28-year-old from Wuyuan, Anhui, currently residing at No. 5, Lane 277, Chengdu Road, hired lawyer Zhu Jiaozhuo to represent him in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against his fiancée, Zhan Qiaohong (19 years old, currently residing at Yida Rice Store, Mai Gao Baolu Road, Eight Immortals Bridge), also from his hometown, and her legal representative, her mother, Zhan Zai, requesting fulfillment of the marriage contract and claiming damages, including the loss of betrothal gifts and travel expenses, totaling 2,792 yuan. According to the complaint, both parties were engaged in the countryside on October 26th of the 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>During the winter of that year, the defendant was kidnapped by bandits. The plaintiff did his best to run around and seek help, and she was rescued. Later, the woman came to Shanghai to open the Deyu Cloth Shop, and she had the plaintiff accompany her to Shanghai to escape. The plaintiff sacrificed his position as the headmaster of the Shichun Elementary School in Wuyuan County for a semester and accompanied the defendant to Shanghai. Later, the plaintiff returned to his hometown and took up a position as a political instructor in the Yubei Section this spring. He received a letter from his mother-in-law, Zhan Wang, urging the plaintiff to come to Shanghai to hold the wedding. The plaintiff came to Shanghai on March 16th and stayed at the Deyu Cloth Shop. Months passed, but there was no news of the wedding. On June 15th, two members of the defendant's clan, Zhan Ruzhang and Zha Jingcheng, claimed to the plaintiff that the defendant did not want to get married and wanted to dissolve the engagement, and they drove the plaintiff out of the Deyu Cloth Shop, not allowing him to stay. Later, they published a newspaper notice saying that the engagement between the plaintiff and the defendant was terminated because "Yu's character is not right, and it is difficult to expect to grow old together." The plaintiff, since his engagement to the defendant, has gone through various difficulties, and it is now so heartless to renounce the marriage, which is unbearable. He sued, requesting that the court order the fulfillment of the marriage contract in accordance with the law and compensate for the losses. Based on the complaint, the court opened the hearing on the morning of the previous day, summoned both parties to examine the case, and both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the case and the object of the request for judgment. The defendant's lawyer argued that the second defendant in this case originally agreed to the marriage, but the first defendant herself extremely opposed it, and the reasons for the opposition were entirely caused by the plaintiff himself. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected and explained in detail the reasons for the defendant's opposition to the marriage. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered the lawyers of both parties to notify the parties to attempt a reconciliation and adjourned the case to the morning of the 16th for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Great China Rubber Factory; Workers Demand Improved Treatment; Factory Has Made Considerable Representations; Workers Still Consider Unsatisfactory</h3>
<p>The products of the Great China Rubber Factory at No. 1102 Xujiahui Road, mainly overshoes, have been in operation for a considerable history. The business can be said to be thriving. There are a total of more than one thousand eight hundred male and female workers in the factory. Unexpectedly, all the workers suddenly went on strike the day before yesterday (the 8th). The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike</p>
<p>After the "January 28th Incident," the factory used the soaring price of raw materials as an excuse to reduce the meal allowance for male workers by three yuan per person and also reduce the piecework wages for female workers by 25%. Recently, the workers, considering the soaring price of rice and the high cost of living, asked the factory to consider the workers' difficult living conditions and requested to restore the original system. At the same time, they requested the payment of bonuses for the years 26 and 27 of the Republic of China and the early purchase of a large amount of cheap white rice (which the factory prepared to use as relief for workers in times of emergency). Because the price of rice has repeatedly soared and it is not easy to purchase it outside, they also requested the factory to sell it to the workers at a fair price as soon as possible. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, all the workers elected Hu Yunsheng, Xue Jizhong, Shen Zijun, Chen Ziren, Huang Yusen, Tang Jiquan, Xue Jinde, and other seven people as representatives to petition Manager Wu Zhesheng and Factory Director Huang Boqin. Because the matter was delayed and unresolved, the workers decided to go on strike for several hours on the 8th.</p>
<p>Factory's Representation</p>
<p>The factory believes that the workers are using the strike as a means of coercion and that their attitude is very strong. After repeated negotiations with the workers' representatives, they finally agreed to: (1) Increase the rice subsidy for male workers by two yuan per person per month, and also subsidize female workers with wages within 14 yuan by two yuan; (2) Regarding the surplus bonus, each person can borrow one month's wages before the accountant arrives in Shanghai; (3) Each worker can purchase 50 pounds of the rice stored in the factory, limited to once per person; (4) Regarding the workers' representatives Hu Yunsheng and the other seven, they must be transferred to the distribution office to serve and be relieved of their duties in the factory.</p>
<p>Continued Petition</p>
<p>The workers believe that the various terms approved by the factory are not satisfactory. However, in order to maintain order, the representatives instructed a part of the workers to resume work first the day before yesterday (the 9th). At the same time, the representatives continued to petition the factory.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

<p>Transportation and Shipping</p>
<h3>General Overview of Chang Hing Company (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Deng Bingquan, Original by H.B. Beaumont</p>
<p>For many years, European countries (England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Portugal) have established a considerable foundation in major Eastern cities through trading companies. Due to trade, transportation between Europe and Asia via the Suez Canal has flourished. Shipping between England, New Zealand, Australia, and Asia via the Suez Canal has also greatly developed. At that time, our company sold joint train and ship tickets for the Pacific, Atlantic, and Canada. If passengers did not want to return via Canada, we sold them tickets for round-the-world trips via the Suez Canal and Canada.</p>
<p>The number of tourists visiting Hawaii, the Orient, and Australia was exceptionally high, which provided our company with an excellent opportunity for development. In 1938, passenger transport between Canada, Hawaii, and Australia increased. As for the Orient, due to the different situation, passenger transport was somewhat inferior. However, in peaceful times, the Orient's tranquil atmosphere, superior environment, and favorable exchange rates gave every tourist advantages that were difficult to obtain elsewhere.</p>
<p>Tourist travel was both individual and in groups, with each group having a leader in charge. Our company, for business needs, had extensive connections with other shipping companies, enabling us to give customers flexibility in their itineraries—allowing them to make long or short stays at any place along the way. Our company offered three different ticket prices to suit the economic capabilities of various tourists.</p>
<p>Secondly, commercial traffic is important because freight and commercial traffic are interconnected, making it very valuable. Missionaries serving abroad had to return home periodically, and new missionaries were sent abroad, either to replace old ones or to be added to foreign stations. Our company handled a large part of this passenger traffic, resulting in intense competition from other shipping companies.</p>
<p>Our company's passenger business in Asia included many Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos traveling between Honolulu and the Orient. For example, Chinese and Japanese people were legally permitted to reside permanently in Canada and the United States or to return to China and Japan for a visit and then come back. Chinese students were also granted temporary permits to study at specialized schools in Canada and the United States. Furthermore, there was a large number of Chinese traveling between the Orient, Havana, the West Indies, and South America. In addition to transporting them across the Pacific, our company also increased its railway business across the continent.</p>
<p>Another source of revenue for our company's Pacific business was what we call transshipment traffic. Among Pacific travelers, those whose destinations were along the ports of call of our company's ships, from the first port to the second, were more numerous than long-distance travelers. The number of these passengers handled by our company was substantial.</p>
<p>Our company's Pacific routes extended as far as Manila, but we had joint transport agreements, so we could directly sell tickets to Singapore, Penang, Colombo, Mumbai, Yangon, Calcutta, and other places. Canadian and Australian shipping companies also had similar joint transport agreements, selling tickets to Durban in South Africa and Cape Town, among other places.</p>
<p>For round trips in the Pacific (Circuit Tours), our company offered various special fares. Passengers could depart from Canada on our company's famous Queen liners to the Orient, then choose any company's ship from the Orient to Australia, and then return to Canada on Canadian-Australian Line ships.</p>
<p>To facilitate travel between San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the Orient, our company had cooperative arrangements with American President Lines and Matson Line. For example, passengers could choose to travel on President Lines or Matson Line ships between the aforementioned cities and Honolulu, while travel from Honolulu was handled by our company's ships. In this way, passengers could save on train fares and time between San Francisco and Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada, and find it extremely convenient.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of our company's ship ticket pricing, because of the great differences in the types, tonnage, and routes of various ships, prices had to be set initially on an independent basis. After many years of experience, pricing was adjusted based on competition from other companies and the cost of the ships themselves, reaching the current level. Any proposed changes to current fares had to be handled through the Pacific Passenger Conference. Any shipping company planning to add a new ship, or adding a ship that had not previously sailed on the Pacific, had to report the ship's capacity, type, fare, etc., in detail to the members of the Conference. The Conference's Fare Committee would then hold a meeting to study and set the price, and report to the Conference, contributing their opinions. In short, the pricing of each member shipping company was determined according to the ship's age, tonnage, and speed rating. If the prices of shipping companies competing with our company were lower, it was because the Conference stipulated a lower rating. Conversely, if our company's prices were lower than those of other companies, the reason was the same.</p>
<p>Summarizing this overview of the Pacific passenger transport business, one can imagine our large company's ships as overseas envoys, reflecting the efficiency of the world's largest travel organization abroad. They promote Canada's trade across the seven seas, using various languages among various races to proclaim the company's and Canada's name and reputation throughout the world.</p>
<p>Our company's honor originally came from all colleagues. The deeper the understanding of this important navigational tool, the greater the accumulation of this glory. The continuous economic success of these maritime giants comes from the interest and responsibility of each individual. I hope that every employee, regardless of their position or responsibility, will act cooperatively to increase the success of our maritime enterprise.</p>
<p>Translator's note—The Canadian Pacific (Chang Hing Company) is the world's largest travel organization. Its business is vast, and its transportation tools are unparalleled in the world. Its business scope extends to the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Great Lakes, and the British Columbia Coast, as well as other lakes and rivers. It has 75 giant ships, with a total tonnage of 500,000.</p>
<p>In 1881, several far-sighted people, led by Mr. George Stephen, who was the first general manager of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, were granted the privilege of completing the railway to the Pacific coast within ten years. By 1886, the first train of the Canadian Pacific Company crossed the continent and reached the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The above is the beginning of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.</p>
<p>In the same year, the company was granted permission to operate the clipper "W.B. Flint." Due to business needs, three more ships were added as a result of a request, specializing in passenger and cargo transport, directly from Vancouver to the Far East. Four years later, regular services were opened to handle trans-Pacific business, using the famous Queen ships, namely the "Empress of China," the "Empress of Japan," and the "Empress of India."</p>
<p>The most notable is the current Far East shipping service, with ships such as the Empress of Japan, Empress of Canada, Empress of Asia, and Empress of Russia sailing every two weeks between Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Japan, Honolulu, Victoria, and Vancouver.</p>
<p>The above ships were specially built to meet this need for navigation in various places. Therefore, the famous white Queen liners are the fastest voyages between the Far East and North America.</p>
<p>The Empress of Japan is the crown of the Pacific ships, and is the fastest and largest in the trans-Pacific business.</p>
<p>Special attention is paid to Chinese transportation. Each ship employs more than 500 Chinese staff, not only making it convenient for passengers traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong, but also for Chinese passengers traveling from the Far East to North America.</p>
<p>The company also owns 21,000 miles of railway in Canada, connecting tourist, industrial, commercial, and agricultural areas. The train equipment is all the latest, and there are streamlined and air-conditioned vehicles.</p>
<p>The company attaches great importance to the proper cooking of meals on the train.</p>
<p>The company has 17 hotels in major Canadian cities and summer resorts, and 9 log cabin camps in the Rocky Mountains and Ontario, providing unparalleled service.</p>
<p>On the Atlantic Ocean, the company has the largest and fastest mail ships, sailing between Canada and England, including one giant Queen ship, four Duchess ships, three "Mont" ships, and five "Beaver" ships.</p>
<p>The largest is the Britannic, with a tonnage of 42,350, with outstanding facilities and spacious accommodations, the crown of any passenger ship in the world. The speed is 24 nautical miles per hour, crossing the Atlantic in just five days. The ship is 760 feet long and 97.5 feet wide. It has an outdoor and an indoor swimming pool, which is also a special advantage, and there is a formal tennis court and a fully equipped gym. The entire air exchange can be done 15 times per hour.</p>
<p>The Queen liners sailing the Pacific Ocean are connected to the magnificent trains traversing Canada, and then connected to the mail ships sailing the Atlantic Ocean. Passengers traveling from the Far East to Western Europe are given the utmost hospitality on the company's ships and trains along the way.</p>
<p>The company also has a vast telegraph network, with telegraph lines 250,000 miles long and 325 miles of submarine cables, communicating with Canada and the world; its wireless radio station is also closely connected with other radio networks in Canada.</p>
<p>There are ten Princess liners traveling between British Columbia and Seattle, Victoria, Vancouver, Alaska, and other major cities on the Northwest coast. There are also three ships carrying passengers and goods between the Great Lakes and Port Mcuicoll, Sault St. Marie, Port Arlbur, and Fort William.</p>
<p>Chang Hing Company's sea, land, and air transportation lines extend to 32,000 miles. There are as many as 8,000 domestic and foreign branches. Travel checks are issued and cashed everywhere, which is very convenient. (End of full text)</p>
<h3>Travel Guide to America</h3>
<p>— Inquiry</p>
<p>(3) Accommodation: Finding a house in the United States is not an easy task. Some people have never seen Chinese people and, influenced by movies and magazines, do not rent to them. However, after renting for the first time and seeing that Chinese students do not make trouble or owe rent, they want to find more Chinese people to live there in the future. On the other hand, in some places where there are many Chinese students, the character is uneven, and some people do some disgraceful things, making it difficult for others to find houses in the future. It can be seen that personal behavior is very important.</p>
<p>Ordinary dormitories, private houses, YMCAs, international apartments, hotels, and other long-term residences in the United States mostly have only single rooms. Each room usually houses one, two, or three people, and single rooms are more expensive. Most houses provide bed sheets, pillowcases, towels, and bath towels in addition to furniture and bedding, which are changed once or twice a week. Some places do not provide towels. The house is usually cleaned once a day. Rent is usually calculated on a weekly basis, and sometimes a contract must be signed for at least one semester.</p>
<p>Finding a house depends on each person's choice, but there are a few points to note. Heating or hot air equipment and hot water in winter are, of course, the most important. Being too close to railways and highways is too noisy. The top floor may be too hot in summer if there is no attic. Other factors, such as the direction of the windows and the size of the room, also need to be considered. As for places like dormitories, the equipment is better, and there are fewer problems to consider. Our compatriots often like to talk loudly, which sometimes provokes reactions from others. If several friends come, in addition to being careful yourself, it is best to close the door to avoid disturbing others.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation: What is described here is only the common method of transportation in American cities. The situation is simply described.</p>
<p>Taxis waiting to be hired on the street, in small cities, mostly have the same price regardless of distance. In big cities, it is calculated by distance and time. In addition to designated stops, empty cars running on the street can also be waved down. Major car companies have certain patterns and colors, which are not difficult to recognize at a glance.</p>
<p>Streetcars in the United States are not as popular as buses now, but the price is cheap. Five cents or a dime can take you from one side of the city to the other. Also, the distance between streetcar stops is very short, and you can transfer at intersections without having to buy another ticket. Most streetcar lines in the middle of the street circle out a place called a "safety zone," which is a place for people waiting for the streetcar to dodge cars.</p>
<p>Buses are similar to streetcars, but because they are not restricted by tracks and wires, they have gradually replaced streetcars in recent years. Some big cities have open-air upper levels on buses, where you can sit and browse the scenery, which is not available on other cars.</p>
<p>Most cities such as New York and Boston have underground cars, and Chicago has elevated cars. Because they do not run on the road surface, they do not conflict with cars, streetcars, pedestrians, etc., so the speed of the cars is very high. The price of this type of car is also very cheap, and it is worth it for longer distances. Spending a nickel can take you more than 20 miles.</p>
<h3>Travel Correspondence</h3>
<p>Answer to Mr. Lu Shui: (1) To go from Shanghai to Shangrao County in Jiangxi Province, it is most convenient to go via Ningbo. The lowest fare for a ship to Ningbo is 5 yuan and 25 cents. The car fare from Ningbo via Hengzhang to Jinhua is more than 12 yuan. After arriving in Jinhua, you can go directly to Shangrao along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The third-class train fare is more than 5 yuan. In terms of procedures, it is more appropriate to have an identity certificate.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Staggered Meal System</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>When I was in Yunnan and Sichuan, I felt that the business of food shops, which served two batches, was a really good opportunity. We outsiders went to fill their gaps, which was just right. I think some places can imitate their system. They eat at nine in the morning and start work at nine thirty, and then eat again after four thirty in the afternoon. There is no meal time in between. Everyone brings some dry snacks to eat at will, which is absolutely free and not forced to stop work; so seven hours of work is actually more productive than eight hours. Although we go to work at nine o'clock, it actually takes half an hour before we can get started and get on the right track, just like a train, running very smoothly; but in just two hours, at half past eleven, we have to prepare to stop work. So when the noon bell rings, it is like the hand chime of a monk, and everyone immediately stands up, disperses, and goes back to eat, and there are inevitably distractions. When we come back to work at one o'clock in the afternoon, it is like a wild horse being domesticated, forced to work until five o'clock. In the half hour before and after that, it is not as good as in the morning. So the so-called eight hours of work is actually only five hours. The most inconvenient thing is that there is a meal time in between, which is not a comfortable rest, but a forced labor, so there are more people suffering from stomach problems. When it is hot summer or cold winter, it is also very wrong to be forced to run around in the scorching sun and rain and snow. If the class time in schools and the office time in banks are changed to a seven-hour system, it would be very beneficial. During these seven hours, everyone can take a five-minute break every two hours and eat some tea and snacks at will, so that they will not be hungry while working. When we went to the examination hall when we were young, we brought four dates with walnut meat, and eating one could last for two hours of hunger, without needing to drink tea. After research, it is very beneficial. It can be seen that the experience of the ancients is also in line with science. If half of the people in an office can voluntarily ask the authorities to allow them to try the staggered meal system, moving two half-hours to the middle to continue working, I think the results of seven hours of work will be impressive. If a school does this, I think the academic performance of this class of students will definitely be much better than average. Friends who eat out can have special gatherings, and food shops can also do a batch of business in their spare time, just like in Sichuan and Yunnan, and they will definitely give special treatment, because the rent and food are not divided.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Light in Residences</h3>
<p>— Longju Sheng</p>
<p>Residence and light are inseparable, because the prerequisite for residence, the light issue, is also one of them. If your residence is a narrow, dark room—a house with dark light (because the light is dark, the air is certainly not clean), would you be willing to move your whole family in? Whether it is a large, unparalleled house or a small, lovely house, if the light is dark, it is not very pleasant to move in. Therefore, the first requirement for building a house is sufficient light and air circulation, which is beneficial to the health of the residents. Health and then, saving on medical expenses, benefits to the family economy must be considerable. As the ancient saying goes: "Poor health is better than wealth and honor," it is not an understatement at all. The daylight in the natural world is endless and inexhaustible for us to take and use. "An inch of time is an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time." We should know how to cherish and value the natural light of day.</p>
<p>As for the night, in the homes of wealthy people, it is certainly bright and dazzling, wasting electricity to seek the willful enjoyment of light. However, wealthy households are extremely few, and many ordinary people who occupy the masses are still worried about food and clothing, let alone the willful enjoyment of nighttime light and the burden of huge electricity expenses. After this city was formed into an isolated island, everything soared in price, and the electric lights, which cannot be without for one night, cannot be saved, unless waiting to return to the primitive era, working at sunrise and resting (sleeping) at sunset, in that way, electric lights are not needed. In the midst of this sound of rising electricity prices again (from September, the Public Concession will have to rise by 120% compared to before. The French Concession will rise by 60%, which is quite alarming!), we can only play an economic calculus. I am from the civilian class, so I have to use my brains to think about ways to save electricity. So I went to the electrical store and bought two "Qian Gongwei Economic Electric Lights". After lighting them, not only do they save electricity, but they are also very bright (this light is a patented product with two sizes of light bulbs. The small one is five candle power and can burn for one thousand hours. A light head with a small square shelf can be used for many years). My house originally had to spend four yuan on electricity, but last month it was reduced by half, and I only paid two yuan for electricity. For those who want bright rooms at night and also want to be economical, "economic electric lights" are the best electricity-saving tool.</p>
<h3>Talking about Sweet Potatoes</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The last issue of this magazine was a "Noodle Food Movement Special Page", which detailed the cooking methods and benefits of noodles, etc. Now that rice is soaring, changing to eating noodles saves a lot of money. I will talk about sweet potatoes again. Although they cannot be compared with rice and noodles, the selling price is cheaper than flour. In barren places, there are plenty of them to be used as food, and they are sweet, delicious, and glutinous when cooked, which is very suitable for the elderly and children. We can use them for breakfast and afternoon snacks, which is also a way to reduce living expenses.</p>
<p>According to Ciyuan: "Sweet potato is originally named sweet potato, and is commonly called yam. It is a vegetable plant with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves, all of which are purplish-brown. The flowers are similar to morning glories but smaller. The tubers are oval, with sharp ends, purple skin, and red flesh. They taste sweet. In the north, they are called red sweet potatoes and are used as food. Another kind has gray skin and white flesh, and tastes bland. It is a variant of sweet potato." According to Bencao: "Chen Qichang's Records of Strange Objects says that sweet potatoes are produced in the homes of the people in Jiaoguang South. They are planted in February and harvested in October. The roots are like taro. Peeling off the purple skin, the flesh is as white as skin. The southerners use them as rice grains, fruits, steamed and moxibustion are fragrant and beautiful, (taste) sweet, flat, non-toxic, (indications) tonifying deficiency, benefiting qi, strengthening the spleen and stomach, strengthening kidney yin, and the effect is the same as yam", then eating sweet potatoes is not only filling, but also has many benefits, and I have developed a better impression of it!</p>
<p>There are also several ways to eat sweet potatoes; ordinary washing, peeling, and cooking makes them delicious. Or cut them into small squares first, cook them, and mix them with starch, and add osmanthus sugar, which is sweet potato , fragrant and delicious. There are also baked sweet potatoes, which are washed and then baked near the charcoal fire on a iron rack on a charcoal stove. When the skin is half charred, try to pinch it with your finger. If it is warm and soft, take it out, peel it and eat it. It has a special flavor, but it is a pity that the fire is too strong and it is not suitable to eat often! It can also be added to vegetarian dishes, or stir-fried with oil and sauce, which can be used with rice or wine. You can also hang sweet potatoes on the eaves, without being exposed to the sun, so that they are dried by the wind. After peeling and eating raw, they are sweet and refreshing.</p>
<p>However, it is cheaper to buy in large quantities. It is best to have people with the same hobby, jointly wholesale a load or several loads from the local goods store, and everyone will distribute them, which will naturally be much cheaper. If you buy cooked sweet potatoes from street vendors, it is not only expensive, but also may not be very clean. In order to comply with the principles of economy and hygiene, it is specially explained here.</p>
<h3>Oral Fortune and Oral Sin</h3>
<h3>Economic Menu for One Week</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Recently, everything has soared in price. Rice has risen to more than 30 yuan per load, and the prices of all kinds of meat and vegetable dishes have also risen by one or more times. My economic menu signboard has been broken with one punch. It used to be enough to have a sample of meat and vegetable dishes for six or seven cents, but now it costs one yuan or one yuan and twenty cents. Pork used to be able to buy more than two pounds for one yuan, but now it is only one pound. Comparatively speaking, beef is still cheaper, and it is also richer in vitamins, so it is okay to eat it every other day during the week. However, stir-fried beef is often easy to become old and not tender. Here is a secret that I will share with readers: After cutting the beef, first mix it with soy sauce and arrowhead powder, and soak the beef in it. After soaking for about an hour, it will be tender and will not become old whether it is stewed, braised, or stir-fried. There are many different ways to cook beef, which are as complicated as pork. The most common ones are curry beef, celery stir-fried beef shreds, and onion stir-fried beef shreds. Some more unique ones are yellow soybeans braised in soy sauce with beef, fermented bean curd braised beef, tomato cabbage potato beef soup (i.e. borscht in Russian restaurants), and mashed potato beef patties, which are all very delicious. If you want to save some rice, then using them to make noodles is also suitable, please readers consider it yourself.</p>

<h3>The Residence of Hitler, the War Maniac</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Mentioning Hitler's name, everyone's mind will conjure up a "peach"-shaped lock of hair on his forehead, and the image of a monster who has revitalized Germany in just six years and is now threatening Europe. According to common sense, such a nation-building figure should live in the most exquisite Western-style house in Berlin. However, the reality is quite the opposite; he actually lives on a desolate mountain cliff.</p>
<p>Hitler is fond of solitude and detests city life. When the National Socialist Party was just starting, he based himself in Munich, Bavaria (a state in southern Germany), but he himself hid in a small village house at the foot of the Alps. This place is 1,500 feet higher than the urban area of Berchtesgaden. In this crude house, he planned various attacks on German democracy. When he became Chancellor, he moved his headquarters to Berlin, but he expanded this place into Berchtesgaden, transforming it into Germany's famous "mountain chalet." Like Mecca for Muslims, National Socialist Party members stood in droves outside his wooden house shouting, "We want to see the Führer!" (meaning Hitler). Thus, this "chalet" still could not bring him peace and solitude. Therefore, in the first half of last year, he decided to climb further up the Alps.</p>
<p>He took a fancy to a piece of land on the treacherous slopes of the summit of the Kehlstein mountain in the Alps. He decided to penetrate the bottom of the peak and drill out the top to build his "paradise" in that inaccessible place. Engineers and mechanics accepted his plan and worked for several months to build him a "residence" made of steel and glass—no, it's simply an eagle's nest. Only an elevator provides access. The road leading to the entrance, built into the mountain, is guarded more strictly than the vaults of the Bank of England. He did not want any more of those "brave mountaineers" shouting, "We want to see the Führer!" on the jagged cliffs around his villa.</p>
<p>These constructions were completed during the September crisis last year. But Hitler did not want many people to know about it. He forbade domestic newspapers from publishing this news and details, and even forbade his closest photographers from taking pictures.</p>
<p>Whenever he has the opportunity, he goes to that villa, 5,500 feet above sea level, to admire the snow-covered valleys and peaks beneath his feet from the small glass pavilion. Berlin is really driving him crazy, because his solitary personality is extremely strong.</p>
<p>In the summer, he takes a plane to Munich, and in the winter, he takes his private train. From Munich, his powerful Mercedes-Benz car speeds him to Salzburg, and then from there, he drives along the mountain road carved out of rock that circles the German Alps to Berchtesgaden. After passing the Berchtesgaden chalet, it's another five miles of winding roads to reach it.</p>
<p>If you go with him, you will immediately see two very large bronze gates, which slowly open as Hitler's car approaches. The car drives straight into the large cave at the foot of the Kehlstein mountain, all the way to the elevator. The cave is dome-shaped, inlaid with unpolished marble, 130 yards long and 20 feet wide, and has a very large space for parking many cars. As for the elevator, it is also magnificent, inlaid with copper wires and equipped with carpeted seats. You can sit comfortably with Hitler and ascend 400 feet to reach the summit.</p>
<p>This villa can accommodate eighteen people, is completely painted white, and has simple Bavarian farmer-style furniture, ready for tea and Hitler's favorite dishes. If you run close to the large window, you will definitely feel dizzy, because the small glass room is built on the edge of a cliff. From here, you can see the scenery in all directions, the mountainous Berchtesgaden, and the snow-covered Alps all around.</p>
<p>It is in this snowy, solitary environment that Hitler has decided on all major national affairs and countermeasures, and has stirred up two or three astonishing waves.</p>
<p>Once, a certain Englishman, who was accompanied by him on a visit, jokingly asked Hitler after returning:</p>
<p>"What if the elevator happens to stop at any point in the 400 feet?"</p>
<p>"Then, I think," Hitler said with a smile, "the history of the world will only be suspended for two hours!"</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Report on the Lives of the Poor: Cow Dung Balls</h3>
<p>— (Mu Xu)</p>
<p>Near Panjiaku on Dunxin Road in West Shanghai, there is an open space of two mu (approximately 1/3 of an acre), where stagnant water has not dried up and weeds grow wildly. This is where the Shanghai Milk Company exclusively piles cow dung.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Milk Company raises nearly a hundred Dutch cows, and the amount of manure they produce every day piles up like small mounds. However, after being dumped on that open space for a short time, it is all gone. At first, I suspected that people were transporting it away to use as fertilizer. Then I thought, in Shanghai, fertilizer is not only worthless but you have to pay to get rid of it. The example of disposing of night soil is a clear example.</p>
<p>One time, when the morning sun was just rising and the dew had not yet dried, I took advantage of the cool early autumn and passed by there. I saw several poorly dressed men and women, and bare-chested children in shorts, competing to scoop up golden-yellow cow dung from the pile and put it into bamboo baskets or kerosene cans. Sweat hung on their faces, but they had no intention of wiping it away. After a while, two of them, who looked like father and son, happily returned home fully loaded.</p>
<p>I wanted to solve this mystery, so I followed them from a distance. When they reached the open space near the First Shelter on Dunxin Road, they stopped to unload the cow dung. After resting for a moment, they bent down and carefully picked up the cow dung from the small bamboo baskets, making them into spherical shapes one by one, scattered across the ground like stars.</p>
<p>"What is this for?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Cow dung balls are used for burning fires, along with straw. They are no worse than coal balls!"</p>
<p>"Can this be burned? Wouldn't its odor make it impossible to even eat the food?"</p>
<p>"If you dry it in the sun and loosen it up, it won't smell, and the heat is very strong!"</p>
<p>"Do you also make it to sell?" I asked him again.</p>
<p>"That's right, we sell it. Three rice bags of cow dung balls can be exchanged for one yuan. After the price of firewood and charcoal soared, it's still not enough to sell. A certain church wants to buy ten yuan's worth right now, but we don't have enough to deliver, so we're rushing to produce more!" He smiled proudly.</p>
<p>"How many cow dung balls can you make every day?"</p>
<p>"On a sunny day, we can produce about one yuan's worth. On a cloudy day, we can't do anything."</p>
<p>Finally, based on his experience, he reported that burning cow dung balls consumes less than half the price of burning firewood and charcoal. It is said that in this corner of West Shanghai, there are thirty to forty families who make a living from this. Cow dung is originally waste, but the poor who are struggling below the starvation line are actually utilizing it, on the one hand, to replace expensive firewood and charcoal, and on the other hand, to maintain a minimum standard of living. Their work, despite being dirty and humble, makes a considerable contribution to society and the family.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Zhuzun's Calligraphy</h3>
<h3>A Day of Teaching in a Lane Primary School</h3>
<p>— Leng Yan (Cold Eyes)</p>
<p>The other day, I received a phone call from my friend Mr. Wang, who, due to some business, could not go to school and asked me to substitute for a day at ×× Road ×× Primary School. Partly out of consideration for his friendship and partly because I was idle anyway, I agreed. So, the day before, Mr. Wang introduced me to the school's "Economic Trustee"—the current principal of several lane primary schools—to meet. The next morning, I went to the school with high spirits. The school consisted of three two-story buildings, all painted in a temple-like, non-temple style, in yellow and blue. Outside the gate, it was prominently written, "Register Quickly," "Low Tuition Fees." At the entrance was a room similar to a reception room, but actually a school store. Sitting inside was a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy, whom I thought was a school employee. Who knew that this trustee actually asked him, "Is your father home?" How dare I! It turned out to be the principal's son!</p>
<p>Inside, we went straight to the side room upstairs. The back half was the classroom, and the front small half was the principal's office. Further inside was the principal's bedroom. It was almost 8:30, but the principal had not yet come to the office. The students had almost all arrived, but classes were said to start at nine o'clock. I regretted coming so early. The trustee was busy and left first, so I had to sit in the principal's office and wait blankly. Around 9:15, the great principal finally came out from the bedroom to meet me, saying that he would inform me when classes were about to start.</p>
<p>But strangely, it was said that school had started on August 20th, but now it was almost mid-September, and even the students' seats had not been arranged yet, let alone the official start of classes. The school was a complete primary school, and there were many teachers, but the principal had to do everything himself. Today, he actually called the roll and arranged the classes himself, grade by grade. The class arrangement had to be done in the courtyard, so one grade left and then another grade came, making it slow and quite disorderly. It took from 9:30 to 12:00 to complete this. Had I known that he would be arranging until 12:00, I would have left earlier. He didn't inform me until then that classes would start promptly at 1:00 in the afternoon, so I had no choice but to come again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Heaven knows! Even the timetable had not been arranged! When I came in the afternoon, the first class was not my class, so I had to sit in the reception room downstairs, which was connected to the classroom, and observe the teaching. Several children were crying and refusing to come to class, so four or five teachers each grabbed a half-inch-thick ruler and dragged them into the room with a menacing attitude. The sound of slapping hands was constantly coming from the next room. Using corporal punishment in this era, such education is really chilling. Have these "teachers" not even flipped through a book on simple normal school education?</p>
<p>The second class was in my assigned classroom, which happened to be outside the principal's office. So, people came and went, old women, children, the principal's wife, plasterers, carpenters, all passed through without hindrance. After teaching for an hour, my throat was itchy and sore. Fortunately, the next class was the end of the day, so I escaped as if granted amnesty, and took a deep breath outside.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Qingzhong Cooperative Society</h3>
<p>— (Zhang)</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that a group of students from the Qingnianhui Middle School, in order to practice thrift, established a cooperative society and an attached used book exchange (which ended many days ago). We have not solicited or canvassed from the outside world. Today, I read the article "Qingnianhui Establishes Used Book Discount Store" in your column, and after reading it, I was shocked and confused. Our society did not "hope that other students (regardless of school) would provide a lot of help and guidance." Since this article was published, quite a few students from other schools have come to our school and cooperative society to inquire, causing a lot of misunderstandings. The author of this article has not yet confirmed whether he or she is a student of our school. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future and to apologize to the students of other schools, I am writing to correct this as above. I wish you well. Qingzhong Cooperative Society</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>

<p>Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Emerges Like Peach Leaves, Miraculous Scene in the Fire Is Actually a Lotus Flower</p>
<p>He Liyu said, "If that's the case, will the future Free Village become an industrial zone? I thought that the Wu culture was refreshing and pleasant here, making it most suitable for living, so my father wanted us to choose a place here to build houses. You say that the residential area and the industrial area are close, is there any problem?" Zhu Airen laughed and said, "I'm just talking casually, you can't test me! So people in the Free Village often say that they are limited to light industry, also because they are afraid that some industries will harm the people's living. Now some of the newly emerging large industries in China often occupy thousands of mu of land, often in originally barren and desolate places with no human habitation. Since the opening up of these places, they have become prosperous. Their markets and local administration are all established based on this large industry, which is another matter. The industries that will be developed in the Free Village in the future will all be light industries, small industries, or semi-manual industries, or industries close to art and culture. Therefore, they do not interfere with living, or even complement each other. There is also one thing, I think there are really too many residents in Shanghai now, and the factories are all crowded in Shanghai, so they must be dispersed. Dispersing from Shanghai means going to the cities and towns and villages near Shanghai. Then, villages like the Free Village will naturally be affected by it." The He sisters felt that what Zhu Airen said was not without reason. They thought that Airen usually only cared about the affairs of a certain pregnant woman and a certain baby, and did not pay much attention to local affairs, especially the affairs of the Free Village. Now hearing her say it, it was all very logical. It can be seen that the common knowledge of women has also improved compared to before. This time, the two Miss He went to Shanghai, and there was another thing that they wanted to discuss on the way, which was to build a factory building, hire an engineer, and prepare all the drawings and designs. Isn't there a ready-made engineer, Mr. Lin Jiancheng, the groom who is going to the wedding banquet this time? It wouldn't hurt to talk to him about this business deal at the wedding banquet. It's just that they are busy, and after the wedding, I don't know if they will have a honeymoon trip. I heard that Jin Danyun was given a month's leave by the superior organization. Lin Jiancheng will naturally also take a month's leave during this newlywed period. During their honeymoon, they can go to various places to spend their sweet years, who can be busy drawing and designing for us? Fortunately, we have plenty of time to prepare, so it wouldn't hurt to talk to him in advance. It is said that</p>
