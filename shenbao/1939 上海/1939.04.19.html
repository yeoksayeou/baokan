<p>蔣委員長答記者問</p>
<h3 id="c1">中國決奮鬥到底　爭取生存獨立自由　主張投降是精神上自己宣告死刑　給日本致命打擊後纔有和平希望　抗戰策略五年前已決定約不變更 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（重慶）十七日紀念週後、有中外新聞記者多人、詢問蔣委員長以下列問題、茲記其問答如下、</p>
<p>記者問、現在還有人說近衛「建立東亞新秩序」的聲明、可以作爲中日和平的根據、而不認其爲亡國條件的、委員長對此、以爲應作如何處置、一</p>
<p>委員長答、「建立東亞新秩序」、就是日本併吞中國的新名詞、我在去年十二月二十六日演講中、將敵國的侵略野心、已經詳加分析、無待煩言、若以近衛的聲明可認爲是可和條件的和字來解釋、那字典中就不必再要投降的「降」字了、這是無恥之極的笑話、不但今日不會有此事、且亦永久不會有此事、中國抗戰的目的、是求保衛整個民族的生存獨立與自由、這個目的一天不能達到、我們的奮鬥一天不能停止、現在戰局愈延長、日本的弱點愈暴露、而他的野心亦更顯著、這就是所謂「圖窮七現」的道理、看了日本軍閥的行動、誰也可以知道他們是要奪取我們整個民族的生命、使我們永久做他們的奴隸、近衛所謂「建立東亞新秩序」、就是日本要獨霸東亞、不僅要消滅中國、而且是要消滅各國在太平洋一切實力的毒計、日本的侵略慾與時俱進、而中國對於日本野心的進展、亦認識得愈加淸楚、所以我們抗戰的意志也愈加堅强、在這種情形之下、絕對無和平的餘地、絕對不是什麼巧佞虛僞的投降理論所能動搖、我們全國旣萬衆一心、對於這種無恥之極的主張者、我以爲照我們中國的道理道德和良心制裁的效力、要大過法紀制裁的效力、這種人在精神上已經自己宜告了死刑、實在値不得一提、至於國家的處分、耍看他以後的行動如何再定、記者問、請問中日戰事、究竟怎麽樣纔可以解決呢、</p>
<p>委員長答、這個問題要看以後事實的演進怎麽樣、現在我們抗戰只有二十二個月、還不滿兩年、而日本第一等國的國際地位、已經被我們抗戰壓低到第二等國的地位上去了、如果我們再加緊的抗戰下去、就照過去的事實來說、我相信不久的時期內、必會使他現在二等國的地位、亦站不住了、這樣一方面他的國力更竭蹶、地位更低落、一方面也耍由我們充實自身的力量、達到有利的時期、有利的地形、給他一個制命的打擊、使他眞正認識中國抗戰的力量、纔有產生和平的希望、我相信、這不但是可能的、而且只要我們努力、這個時期的到來、一定是很快的、除此以外、如果要想中日間恢復和平、那就除非日本軍閥有澈底的覺悟、自動的放棄侵略、將他們傳統政策根本改變不可、若是他們根本不放棄侵略政策、不能根絕他們所謂「東亞新秩序」的夢想、那麽不特中日戰爭絕對沒有結束的可能、而且東亞也永久沒有和平的時侯、今天是中華民族稍有心肝的黃帝子孫、無論他的知識程度如何低下、也決不肯說近衛的「東亞新秩序」不是吞併中國的亡國條件、敵人的野心和中國人民的認識、已經明白到這樣地步、如果還有人辯解近衛聲明不是滅亡中國的條件、而以爲還是可和、這不是求降賣國是什麽、乾脆說、這種人不但不惜以漢奸自居、簡直是甘心作日本的奴隸了、</p>
<p>記者問、今後戰局將如何演變、中國是吾仍照原定的長期抗戰的戰略貫澈到底、委員長答、我在五年前曾有一篇「抵禦外侮和復興民族」的演講、討論到中日發生戰爭時、我們抗戰的策略、諾位祇要看我那一篇演講、就可以知道、我們今天所用的戰略是五年以前早已決定了的、我們決不改變以空間換時間、積小勝爲大勝」的整個的戰略、與一貫的政策、我們當時就決定不戰則已、旣戰就必須貫澈到底、卽使全國各地完全失陷、我們也有把他恢復轉來的把握和自信、那時我們從最不利的情况着想、曾經下定最後的決心、當時的預計、以爲敵人要費十六個月的時間、纔能進犯到我們十八個省分、現在我們抗戰已經二十二個月、我們依然能保持着許多完整的省分、卽使已經被佔的省分亦不過淪陷了幾個省城據點、在那些省分內、所有的土地和人民、仍舊在我們軍隊勢力範圍掌握之下、敵軍不僅毫無所得、而且他正在照着我們預定的計劃、陷入泥淖、踏入崩潰的道路、以後就要隨時隨地受我們最後制命傷的打擊、所以我們今天在抗戰整個的局勢來說、決不能以幾個省城據點的得失、來觀測抗戰最後的成敗、大家明白了我們一貫的政策、及整個的戰略以後、就再不會被那些爲敵張目的無恥漢奸理論所欺騙、（十八日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c4">觀察國際現象 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>有關國際之一切現象，日趨錯綜複雜；若使偶爾諦視，殆不免於目迷五色，不可究詰之感；顧乃問題當前，利害切膚·亟願理解之者，不知凡幾何人焉。常人對此，誠非習有基本常識，將無自而知問題之所由來；誠非加以繼續不斷之注意，將無自而知問題最近之起伏演變。若自現象更進而求方來之趨歸，允所未易言。彼英國外交，夙爲舉世所稱道，蓋英人於國際智能，近乎具有先天之特長；當國閥閱，淵源有自，更無論矣。然含垢忍辱·委曲求全於慕尼黑，而仍無補於綏靖政策之失敗；保守黨紳士對於共產之蘇俄，不惟岸然敬而遠之，實僧惡之如毒蛇猛獸，今乃趨蹌於莫斯科惟恐不及；對東歐，因利乘便則操縱之，操縱所不及則遺棄之，今乃不辭莫大之負荷而慨然予波蘭諸國以保障；凡此數者，皆英國最近之傑作，夫豈英國外交之翻雲覆雨爲不可及哉？若在數月之前，舉之以問富有國際智能之英國人，謂綏靖政策將爲德義所侮弄而德義寗受箝制，英國將納交於蘇俄而在東歐較蘇俄負更重之責任，彼且嗤之以鼻，而視所問者爲匪夷所思，蓋此皆違反國際常識之問題也。曾無多日，現象皆出當初常識之外；於是可知有關國際者，事屬難言。雖然，國際事復非絕無準則而絕不可言，一切悲歡離合，終無所逃於利害之準則者也。此固老生常談，然或爲一時之現象所欺而忽略準則，或因忽略準則而心勞日拙。試證以遠東近事。</p>
<p>前日上海英法人間，發見英文傳單，以中國共產黨具名而攻訐英法，謂英法乃爲中國之敵人。又於中國之淪陷區域，發見中文之反英標語。此二事，無論中國境內有不同之主義之存在，無論表現之工具爲何國文字，要之，不能寃中國人。何也，違反利害準則也。中國爲求國族之自由與生存而抗日，中國自發之，非他國所得鼓動，亦非他國所得阻止。英法蘇俄爲正義而同情於中國，此種動機，自屬不容一筆抹煞；然所以資助中國者，其理由猶在正義之上。蓋日本滅亡中國，則英法蘇俄俱遭其殃；中國擊退日本，則英法蘇俄俱享其成；英法蘇俄坐視中國孤苦却敵而不予資助，則戰禍愈久愈酷，而英法蘇俄并受愈劣之影響；英法蘇俄資助中國却敵，則中國與英法蘇俄之共通福利愈見光大。侵中國者，中國之敵；助中國者，中國之友。利害分明，友敵分明，豈任何言辭所得顚倒之，更張之。分明之甚，有目共覩，豈任何手術所得而掩飾之，混淆之。故反英標語雖作中文，而中國當局不受詰責；攻訐英法傳單雖以中國共產黨名義，而英國路透社樂爲中國共產黨電傳吾認之辭。惟彼忽略利害準則而出此，故不惟絕無功用，徒以自暴其心勞日拙而已。抑不僅此類事已也，日本報紙雜誌論壇，數數對於中國國共之精誠團結，表示疑訝；日本當局且以其侵略之不能成功，歸因於各國之助華，且視助華爲意外。其意若曰：侵略之計畫，無國共團結之假定也，無各國助華之假定也，事實出乎假定之外，於是困苦與失敗出乎計畫之外。其實中國之內臻統一，外得衆助，絕非感情使然，宣傳使然，乃爲適合利害準則之必然現象；彼徒以利令智昏而忽略之耳。循是而推論一般國際現象，無論錯綜複雜至於如何程度，無論方來演變之將如何趨歸，藉日種種翻雲覆雨將層見疊出而至於無窮無盡，萬難預料·萬難斷言；然以準則所在，在反侵略者以禍福所共而必聲應氣求，愈形密切；在侵略者旣或因利害衝突而有反目之日·復必因聲勢日孤而底於敗亡。據此定識，必能對於紛擾之國際，把握定見而無所惶惑！</p>

<p>（重慶）自華軍日前放棄南昌、關於今後抗戰形勢、國內外均極度注意、尤以對於日軍或將進犯長沙之企圖、各方莫不加以甚大之關心、或且以爲倘使日軍一日侵據長沙、將能達到其控制中國西部各省、從而覓取資源、以减輕其本國軍事負擔之目的、本社記者、頃特爲此訪謁軍委會發言人、叩詢一切、承發表談話如决、</p>
<p>就表面觀之、敵軍侵據南昌、我浙贛鐵路旣被切斷、交通運輸比較困難、對今後抗戰形勢、自不無相當影響、然細察內容、卽知我軍此决毅然放棄南昌、對於今後抗戰形勢、不獨無絲毫影響、母寗謂於我</p>
<p>反爲有利</p>
<p>第一就軍事上言、此决贛北之役，血戰經旬、我軍因運用得宜、且官兵視死如歸、已澈底完成消耗戰之任務、敵華中派遣軍主力傷亡三萬人以上、死聯隊長四、大隊長多名、曁其他重要軍官甚夥、其作戰實力已大形减弱、而我軍作戰主要目的、本在利用山地、誘敵深入、俟吸引敵軍多數主力於適當地區時、敵軍各種機械化武器、將失其效用、然後乃可以發揮我軍優點、予敵以</p>
<p>致命打擊</p>
<p>使喪失戰鬥能力、原不在乎一城一地、之得失、敵此决進犯贛北、犧牲如此重大、正亦此故、而我軍放棄南昌、將主力轉移於有利陣地、亦屬必要之措置、今後敵泥足所至、將愈陷愈深、如更出以進犯長沙之冒險行動、則共犧牲程度、必更爲鉅大、決無疑義、此共一、第二就政治上言、敵自侵據武漢以後、不啻墮入我方預設之陷阱、蓋敵方人力財力物力、均已至其國策所不許之境界、故武漢四圍會戰吿一段落、敵軍事行動卽陷於</p>
<p>不能再進</p>
<p>一面發表所謂近衛聲明、藉和平幌子、冀誘我入彀、然在我持久抗戰國策之下、此項陰謀、未能實現、其政略完全失敗、近來敵方反戰怒潮、更如荼如火、國內民心之渙散、與前錢士氣之頹喪、均達極度、今回贛北戰事之發動、不過欲藉以轉移視錢、而緩和軍民反戰心理、初不料所付代價、如此之大也、是以民心士氣、更感不安、且此後作戰、</p>
<p>益形困難</p>
<p>如西侵長沙、其所付代價、自益非數字可能估計、此其二、第三、就經濟上言、敵在此决侵華戰爭中所消耗之戰費一百萬萬以上、公債總額達百六十萬萬、大部份爲赤字、現估計平均每日需一千四百萬元左右、雖羅掘盡凈、亦無能爲力、在中國掠取資源之企圖、自甚積極、然淪陷區內旣有我游擊大軍、配合民衆武力、不斷予　强烈打擊、使</p>
<p>寢不安枕</p>
<p>至侵據南昌以後、轉鋒西犯長沙、縱令我浙贛乃至湘贛交通全被切斷、然我方對外運輸重心、並不在東南沿海、由東南沿海輸入者、不過一部份消耗金錢之奢侈品而已、今後此項奢侈品輸入路錢、如果中斷、除無形中可節省我不少民力國力外、更可集中全力於其他運輸路綫、各種重要物資進出入之調劑、對我實</p>
<p>和利無害</p>
<p>敵掠取我資源之企圖、尙且無法實現、更何從控制我西部各省上、因知無論就軍事政治經濟、任何一點觀察、敵軍侵據南昌、乃至西犯長沙、不過證明其回光返照、其總崩潰之期必不在遠、而我爲擁護國家民族之獨立生存、與夫人類公理正義而戰、人財物力均無窮碟、用能越打越强、愈戰愈勇、最後勝利必屬於我、而南昌放棄後之我敵雙方形勢、由此實已洞若觀火也、（十八日電）</p>

<h3 id="c20">夫婦之道的基本原則 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>夫婦有大道，唯在體健康　男強女健美，愛情與天長！</p>
<p>女大當嫁，男大當娶，已婚的男女，夫婦之道，果然有切身關係，就是未婚的男女，因爲夫婦是他們將來所必經的過程，也沒有一個不在熱心地憧憬着。夫婦之道關於人身幸福實在太大了！照理，這些智識，旣有人人共同的需要，就應當在家庭裏，社會間普遍地予以正大光明的敎育，可是大家都諱莫如深，因此，一般好奇和求智慾强烈的靑年每每地徬徨在歧途之上，被黑暗和悲慘吞沒着，這不是殘忍而醜惡的封建遺毒嗎？</p>
<p>夫婦之道，應該是眞的善的美的，換句話說也是科學的哲學的藝術的，因爲少不了靈肉一致的條件。靈果然是屬於精神的美化的，肉就是科學的生理的了。一對成年男女，他們因爲生理的成熟，就發生一種本能的要求。這種本能的要求是根據身體健康的。誠然，一個精力充沛的强壯男子一旦娶了一個健美多姿的女郎，在本能上因爲得到相互的歡慰，就發生着濃蜜的愛情。因此，在愛的協調中，靈肉一致裏，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，這是何等的幸福！在此種情景下，夫婦間必然相互地陶融，形同一體，雖或在志氣，習慣上稍有些歧異，但必早已潛移默化了。或正以歧異而收截長補短之功，引爲可貴。反之如果有一方本能衰弱或竟喪失，如男子於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾與憂勞斵傷之故，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，那他的婚姻無論是如何志同道合的結合，因爲夫婦生活的不能圓滿，愛悄必然淡薄，或竟形同冰炭，演出家庭間之種種悲劇！所以無愛情的夫婦，實是人世間的罪惡與地獄！聰明丈夫，欲謀補救，必須根本治愈其疾病。治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症，完全治愈，並可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精對，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3 id="c21">乳峯是女性的健美領隊 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>醜由衰弱起。美從健康來！</p>
<p>丯乳與肥臀：怎不令人愛？</p>
<p>醜陋兩個字，誰都不願意加到自己身上。而於女性爲允甚，蓋女性的愛美和好勝心，都比男子强烈，她們不但當面有人說她醜陋，要氣得杏眼圓睜，蛾眉倒堅，把你恨入骨髓，就是無意中說着她的短處，她也會背人流淚，自慚自恨！若竟然有人當面和她比較妍媸—尤其在情塲爭逐時給她一個『蓋照』，那麼她眞會氣得發在或自殺的呢！所以法國美容專家兼婦科名醫威泥基博士說健美是女性的第二生命，此話信然。但怎樣才合健美的標準？此據博士說：女性的乳峯，須有二英寸半高聳出，柔靱而必須有彈性，以狀態不下垂爲合格，乳頭要充分突出，色帶紫紅爲最佳，此外更須具有丯腴的臀部，婀娜的腰身，若能具備這樣條件，則不但在交際塲中，可以似雞羣之鶴，被異性們視同壤實，熱烈追求，就是在自身的健康上，因爲卵巢機能的强盛，雖年齡漸增，亦不會衰老，依然嬌艷動人。</p>
<p>然而因疾病侵害，以致身體　弱，乳祟萎痬的女子，將怎樣以謀補救呢？此據博士和其他著名醫師論斷，咸推服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，最爲對症而特效，蓋此劑不僅可以滋補卵巢機能，助長乳峯發育，且能調整月經，消滅子宮一切障碍，增加妊娠能力，美顏强身，因藥力驚人，備受中外人士讚許，譽爲『婦女恩物』。性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<h3 id="c22">遺精所引起的一般疾病 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精是靑年人的通病，正因其通病，大家都不把它當疾病看待，所以山遺精失治所引起的嚴重後果，眞是多不勝計，同時病根蔓延，千變萬化，也是危險之至！因爲生理成熟後的男子體內精液，實是主宰健康和壽命的主要內分泌腺，功能助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，滋養各部神經。如果精液充沛，必然思想豐富，精力雄偉，前途的光明和幸福無量！要是因自凟，思淫或憂勞斵傷等原因，患有遺精，更因遺精頻繁致精枯血竭，那發育機能就受其阻止，新代謝作用，亦因以减退，腦，脊髓，性三大神經更受其摧殘·則凡發育不全，面黃肌瘦，身材低矮，性器短小，腦衰健忘，失眠多夢，耳鳴眼花，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎等病必相繼而來，更因精液的流失過多，致精液稀薄，缺乏精蟲，造成不育症，誠如這樣靑年，不特奄奄一息，無力爲學就業，潦倒終身，即人生最低限度的夫婦生活上，亦必愛情淡薄，形同冰炭，子女無出，貽終生大憾！</p>
<p>欲謀補救，在此時只有服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，鎭靜神經，遺精自可痊愈。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根本治愈上述各症，並可收延年益壽之效。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等多種對症療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>慢性白濁之特徵甚多，而痛苦减少亦其一也、他如變症日多，毒氣　蔓，病勢日深，挽治亦愈不晚。非有聰明特識的醫家，運用最科學之方法爲之治療，鮮能奏其全功。而慢性淋之患者日衆，因而淋病患者如醫家吿之已轉入慢性，猶如囚徒之聞判無期徒刑。實則誤矣。大概白濁之由急入慢，必由於在急性淋時，失於徹底之根治，往往於染病後二三星期中，失治或誤治，痛苦漸漸减少，膿液漸减，尿液亦山溷濁而澄淸，一切急性淋時之症象，均漸歸消失，在痛苦减輕方面，固然是淋病患者一時肉體上得到暫時的快樂，而實際上之內部隱患却甚爲深刻。</p>
<p>根治之新方針</p>
<p>由痛苦不堪而實際上晚於根治之急性淋，一變而爲老頑固之淋病，則不可不採用對症之新療法，而首要之條件有三。一爲殺菌，二爲濾毒，三爲矯正病態，能合此等方針之理想的療法，惟有採用德國濾淋平流電療法，及注射德國希氏血淸，與捷敏手術，始可迅速根本治愈之。凡慢性淋之攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，關節炎，睪丸炎，精囊炎，及尿道狹窄等，皆可限期根本治愈，並因濾淋平流電療法之能濾淸淋毒，對於由淋毒而發生之神經痛，更著特效也。</p>

<p>香港通信、關於珠江通航之英日協定，規定每兩週出港派金山輪開赴廣州一次、日前港方依照該協定派佛山輪瓜代金山輪赴省、抵省後，仍泊太古倉橋、停留兩日返港、共達一千一百餘人、西人佔絕少數、無論十二元、八元·五元·等客位、均告客滿、情形至為擁擠、茲探其中乘客報告最近廣州情形如下、</p>
<p>華空軍迭毀日機場</p>
<p>中國新空軍某某兩隊、近奉令協助第四戰區反攻部隊殲敵後、屢次出現廣州市上空、當其來時、輒在晨光喜微之際、市民每在夢中為炸彈與高射炮聲所驚醒、炸毀日軍在市郊所經營之軍事建設頗多、尤以上月廿四·廿五·兩日收效最為偉大、查二十四日天　放亮、中國空軍十架、突然飛至、日軍在倉皇中、未及發出警報、即開高射炮亂射、極形狼狽、但中國空軍、翱翔自如、並擇定目標、以最敏捷方法、從萬尺高空急降、分向白雲·天河·兩　場連續投擲重彈二十餘枚、爆炸之聲、全市震動、日軍裝在瘦狗嶺·白雲山·牛蘭崗·各處之高射炮、雖發出密如連珠、亦不能威脅中國空軍、隨後日機由虎門方面飛至、圖截中國空軍、但中國空軍、已完成任務、衝出重圍而退、是役、炸毀白雲·天河·兩機場之日機六七架、又二十五日、中國空軍一隊到虎門、轟炸石角炮臺、旋到白沙上空、向該處日軍經營之小型機場投下重量炸彈六枚、該機場業已被炸毀無遺、中國空軍、在聶炸日軍軍事建設外、並散發傳單、聲言各路大軍、行將大舉反攻、著市內居民、早日離市、以免玉石俱焚、此種傳單、日方嚴禁市民拾取、違者即加歐擊、然亦不少已為居民傳閱、相告化裝離市、故情形較前混亂、人心皇皇、寢食不安</p>
<p>日傷兵源源返廣州</p>
<p>日軍進犯容桂　門後、各地均發生劇戰、廣州日軍軍連、異常忙碌、珠江河內電船、往來頻繁、運輸軍實、而日軍傷亡官兵、自戰區運返廣州者、源源不絕、傷亡之數、想亦不少、且日軍每日下令戒嚴、其戒嚴範圍、係由南堤天字碼頭起、以迄漢民路一帶、均有日軍站崗、不准行人通過、情形極為嚴重、蓋係自戰區運輸傷兵返省也、每次運省傷兵、輒在千人以上、其中如上月三十日、由西江用民船數十艘運送返省之傷兵有數千人、中有高級軍官二人、亦負重傷、可見其傷亡之重大矣、</p>
<p>匪徒凶惡白晝橫行</p>
<p>廣州市而狀況、視前更為混亂、目前商人在日軍威脅之下、忍痛恢復營業、然市內匪風披猖、商店多被掠劫、其始多在夜間為之、近則愈弄愈凶、白晝橫行、視日軍警如無物、市西某街、曾為匪徒數十人、把握街頭街尾、大舉洗劫、適有一日軍巡至、為匪徒擒獲斬首、將首級高懸電杆之上、始從容而去、商人因血本關係、不勝掠刦、故大多停業、綜計最近市內商店、較前月減少達十份之五、其未歇業者、多兼營數業、長生店兼營柴米者有之、肉店兼營蔬菜者亦有之、秩序異常淩亂、大有類於窮鄉僻壤之小市集、且匪徒之猖獗、不僅對於商店住戶如是、即對日人亦時施搶刦、沙面外人之人市者、亦時遭光顧、其行刦目的、不論多少、即襄有二三角赴茶摟品銘者、亦被掠去、故居民從在日間、亦不敢出門、以避匪刦、因此市面除三數大馬路除有三二行入外、橫街小巷、絕無行人、雖在白晝、亦如鬼墟邇來中國遊擊隊散布市區內外、日人無法應付、據可靠消息、自市區以迄四郊、遊擊隊之潛伏者、確有驚人數目、約計不下五萬餘眾、其中成分、除市郊及南番兩縣各鄉壯丁外、遠至中山·順德·東莞·增城·從化·等縣、亦多奉派或自動投入廣州內部、秘密工作、相機襲擊日軍、上月攻入正金銀行之役、即為各屬遊擊隊在廣州配合協同動作之表現、且槍械新式、子彈充足、每一發動、令散處而秒數之日軍、無法搞拒、實行以日人後方為前方、平時不輕於發動、每一次發動、必有大目的、不達不休、真天上民眾武力、已在日人勢力下滋長、組織日就龐大、為不可磨滅之事實、</p>
<p>少數商店被逼復業</p>
<p>現在廣州酒家之復業者、有大三元·金龍·七妙齋·（即前名園）金輪·等靈敏家、均因被日軍強逼而復業、否則被日軍沒收、自行營業、但有一部不肖商人、竟開設大「支那料理」、並狂言妄語、宣揚歡迎「皇軍」、其內則雇用一部日本女子為招待員、遊擊隊最近予該酒家資方以警告、該酒家乃請日軍司令部保護、日軍著偽警隊派便衣探員前往、該酒樓恐慌益甚、蓋深知此等密探、均為匪類、保護不足、而騷攪有餘也、</p>
<p>擬查戶口不敢進行</p>
<p>日軍感於遊擊隊之潛伏滋長、極為焦慮、曾與偽組織會商清查戶口、第感於日軍及偽組織人數不多、不能同時大舉清查、東來西散、甚且慮遊擊隊先發制人、日方又極力吸誘各地人民返市、以「安居樂業」四字為號召、又對於清查戶口、恐引起市區內騷動、則民眾更裹足不前、凡此種種、均為日軍所顧慮而無法解決者、故廣州日軍、乃常有不能安枕之痛也、</p>
<p>離市民眾備受虐待</p>
<p>此次乘輪來港之市民、離市時、備受日方苛虐、除向日軍司令部繳納钜金領取出口證外、並須經過種種盤查、稍有支吾、即拒絕發證、登輪時、碼頭上並派有大隊日軍搜查、稍有不留意者、即橫遭歐辱、即西人亦不免、此次同輪之某西人、由吊橋登輪、為日軍制止、該西人略為質詢、日軍竟制止、該西人略為質詢、日軍竟置諸不理、拳足交加、該西人亦無如之何、總之、現在之廣州、已為匪徒及日人所盤據、留居市民、不啻如俎上魚肉、任由宰割、有勝其苦也、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、變動範圍依然狹隘、全天五元差度、情勢則由疲轉緊、初開雖某銀樓代港幫吸購、奈現金號頻來拋塞、故潛勢略帶疲軟、嗣後津廈兩幫突來跟蹤港幫搜購、因之市勢遂轉緊穩、昂達當日之高峯二千〇八十元收盤、結果軋漲三元、交易因本地幫觀望、故而奇清、僅四百五十兩、銀樓飾金屹然不動、海關金亦平、中英純金等略向上升、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲三元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因現金號賣意頗濃、首喊二千〇七十七元賣出、但進者多懷觀望、後價雖喊低至七十五元、然其時仍難獲對手、迨至十時光景、某銀樓忽代港幫趁低吸購、故方見成交、首由現金號賣予某銀樓五十兩、二千〇七十五元為開盤價、較之隔昨午收做低二元、開後某銀樓相同價又吸進現金號共七十兩、此後現金號止售觀望、且某金號與證券幫相繼搜購、故潛勢轉堅、某金號進同業五十兩、價七十六元、斷之證券幫進錢兌業卅兩、價則相同、後錢兌業進銀樓幫五十兩、價七十七元、證券幫又進銀樓幫五十兩、七十八元、不久錢兌業進銀樓幫五十兩、價八十元、時已十一點半、但買戶八十元仍想收購、而售者需八十一元元方肯供給、延至午時未見做開、故午收仍為八十元、午復供求愈稀、致市況益形呆滯、僅見金號互做五十兩、價八十元、致晚收價仍作二千〇八十元、結果收隔昨午收軋漲三元、全天五元差度、現金號之本牌金、售出價二千〇八十五元、收進二千〇七十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出因烚赤穩定、鮮少變幻、故屹然不動、大同行仍為二百十一元、新同行為二百〇九元、收進二百〇三元、</p>
<p>中英純金微漲</p>
<p>十七日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊趨勢疲軟、故每盎司遂漲半辦士、計七鎊八先令六辦士半、至中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦昂達一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準金價亦隨升三角、計一千二百〇七元九角、</p>

<p>後市油洋行亞細亞首來扒結麥加利英匯八辦士二五、繼之孟買銀公司突來吐售美金、但外行有利代天津幫趁賤扒進、故未蒙影響、孟買銀公司賣予有利美匯十六元〇九三七五、入後外行荷蘭吐予洋行港匯五十六元、為狀仍平、迨晚收銀行賣價英匯八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、結果較之上日晚收、英美兩匯、均無榮辱、港匯亦無上落、</p>

<p>昨日英純金漲半便士、英美匯兌未更、本埠外匯、洋行結款甚殷、銀行供給頗暢、嗣金號天津幫來進、散戶供給未暢、趨勢堅硬、下午錢兌業等仍多吸納、人心堅定、惟交易未旺、結果較前晚微升、外幣英美金鎊、需要未旺、殷富拋塞較盛、英美金票客戶吸納甚健、港幣穩定、變動甚微、澳金票復升達前價、朝鮮票供給旺而需要稀、市價每況愈下、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、英金鎊降五分、英金票升一分、美金票升二厘、香港票降一厘、澳金票升三角五分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>

<p>今次絲市再度上漲以來、本埠絲市、因鑒於過雲經營手法之錯誤、故鹹抱穩健態度、致上海絲價上升甚緩、乃得和洋行接近、四五日來、外銷逐日開展、絲價日升十元、有此正常之發展、乃有昨市盛大之交易、昨日怡和·達昌·連納·等各有進胃、白廠七八分二〇-二二條紋、價一千七百元、計做開三百擔之譜、堪稱盛極一時、絲價則僅較前日再漲十元、目前內外絲市、無疑尚有上挺可能、但有一點、似須值得注意、即一般人心、現又過份樂觀、以為目前日美絲價、早已超越前次高昂紀錄、僅上海絲市、現在雖絲交旺盛、而與前次一九五〇元紀錄、則相差仍屬遙遠、有此心理、乃可能造成重陷前次覆轍、然一考前次騰漲事實、即可知此種言論之不合事理、蓋前月中旬、上海用戶絲市售開一九五〇元之時、正為白廠B字七八分對外發電價一七一五元、毫無回音之日、故前次本埠高價紀錄、未能與今日外銷絲價比較、可無疑議、總之、觀察目前絲價之發展、認為暫時還有上挺餘勁則可、如再期待一九五〇元之重臨、則頗非易事、此點、邇來用戶絲市之寂然無聞、及吃價較洋行低五〇元許等事實、亦可藉以窺得今後絲價趨向之一般、又昨有湖絲五十件運歐洲、</p>

<p>上日狂騰之紗市、昨則略現平定之象、同時客方帶路不及昨日之夥、人氣不若過去之熱烈、實則比春假封關前之低降價已漲三十六七元至四十元、就棉紗本身問題著想、暫時可告一段落、不過據一部份現商之議論、前途仍在昂漲中、謂一則此番見過低盤上來、受華南諸實際需要來扶植而轉機、二則內地輸送線、浙贛路晚中斷、業已改由汕頭內地轉運、紗銷益覺起色、且存貨抽空不少、所以吸收之額、始終不肯輕易放棄也、故昨日之趨勢、殆呈大漲小回頭之局面、根本關鍵、仍在實際地位上著想也、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、承上日之余氣續升、開價加一元、二十支雙馬價為四百〇四元、棧單做到三百九十八元半、但客幫銷胃因上日漲勢太狂、胃口稍滯而勿動、至於一般浮戶、鑒於現紗轉呆、脫售之意愈懈、市盤忽見下弱、步步回落、雙馬做到四百元、棧單價為三百九十六元、迨至收盤時多方某某等又來塌便宜貨、復見回升一元、為四百〇一元半、但同行成交為多、結果全日各幫買雲統計一千八百五十二包、行情二十支雙馬大女兩牌比上日均跌一元半至二元、其餘三二支及四二支仍漲二三元不等、振華廠開出四十元、利泰廠開出二十支醒獅一百四十五包、價為三百七十七元、昨有紗七百五十件運天津、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、連跌已有多日、同業所密切注意之華盛頓方面對於貸款棉尚無公佈消息、殊使各方深慮棉之放出及出口津貼之　不執行、皆因政府困難重重故也、昨又疑乃政府之棉業計劃、略有更改、紐約五月份交割期迫、及利物浦棉市異常挺堅、因之各老花空戶抵補甚烈、五月份漲上四磅音、印度連同預測漲羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、折合法幣棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西每擔漲八角、印棉漲七角、埃及漲六角餘、</p>

<p>首尾相接、自棧房駛往江海關、由海　檢查人員檢騐包裹、然後載輪運往海防、總局人口處週圍積有包裹數千件、途爲之塞、且四川路橋與江西路橋間之北蘇州路兩旁、所積郵件、綿連不斷、郵寄物件之多、由此可以想見、據昨向包裹間探悉、此等包裹中、含有敎育用品·中國藥材·棉織物·化妝品與供內地大學</p>
<p>學生應用</p>
<p>之外國敎科書等、包裹間某員聲稱、內地各城市需要文具與其他敎育用品甚殷、在上海出洋一角可購之學校練習簿、在重慶購之、須五角之多、墨水在重慶·昆明·與貴陽等地、價亦甚昂、每小瓶普通國貨墨水、零售須洋五角左右、中政府雖禁運化妝品等奢侈物、但亦有大批化妝品、待運往昆明、而分銷於內地其他城市、但大部份包裹中均爲毛巾·牀毯等棉織物、包裹</p>
<p>運往海防</p>
<p>停頓四十日、昨日始行恢復、截至昨日傍晚爲止、經海關人員檢騐之包裹、的八千件左右、鑒於大批包裹猶積存郵局棧房中、聞包裹間與運輸部職員或將每晚工作至十二時、歷一星期有奇、始能將此等包裹運出、但本埠商人、每日仍有更多包裹、交郵局寄往內地目前、僅有多數輪船由滬直駛海防、每輪限載包裹一千件、惟</p>
<p>較大輪船</p>
<p>或每次可載二千件左右、海防之郵局、範圍頗小、劉於廣州陷落後、取道越南之大量貨運無力應付、且海防至河內至昆明之鐵道、係屬單軌、每日僅能運貨數百噸、故益增困難、聞因此之故、海防郵政當局請本埠郵局當局致電預吿每日運往該地之包裹數量、以免鐵路交通</p>
<p>擁擠不堪</p>
<p>據包裹問人員的略估計、郵局機房中所積包裹、當在五萬至十萬件之間、目預料本埠商人將以更多之包裹、交郵局寄發、寄往川·黔·滇三省之包裹、昨日旣已運出、而國內外寄來之大批包裹、亦已運入郵局而存諸棧房矣、</p>

<p>與中國自己所管區之成績、適如晝夜之相反、台氏於的五年前、將返紐的時、曾遊中國西部、見川滇兩省中所梳罌粟觸目皆是、在街道上可嗅得雅片之味、蓋此種麻醉物到處公開售吸、版賣毒物者、無不營業興盛惟至今日、出售雅片之店、均已停業、亦不復嗅得其味矣、田野中罌粟盡經剷除、代之者乃生活所需之新穀類、華西之另一種改變、博得台氏之讚揚者、厥爲今在內地進行中之巨大建築計畫、而允以農業之發展爲善、台氏又稱、</p>

<p>饒神父的生活起居，是單純化的，除祈禱工作而外，似乎一無所事·他著一件神父們所穿的黑長袍，頭上戴著法國人喜歡戴的小帽子Buney，前面訂着一個小型的船錨，左襟上懸一萬國紅十字會的徽章，手裹拿一本金緣革面的日課經本，除此以外，了無他物。自從巴黎政府授以光榮勳章後，他就在鈕扣上扣上一條紅白藍三色的絲綵，表示他獲着武士（Chevalier的榮譽。他有一副大眼睛，一對大耳朶，一抹濃鬚，掛在嘴上，滿面現出微笑仁慈的樣子。他的鼻子突出而下钩，中國人說是龍隼，外國人說他像猶太人，他的身軀頎長血雄偉，酷似英美人，而非拉丁種族；從性情方面說，他是一位宅心忠厚，和易近人，長於籌劃，勇於執行，極有決心的人。他的閒時極少，珍惜分陰，除難民公務外，且時常演講開會和講道。當他做主席宣布開會，或討論難民問題時，他的左臂緊壓在案上，滔滔不絕地發表一己的主張，條理不紊，步驟井然，態度似乎有點獨栽，其實他所主張的，正是衆人所欲說而尙未形成的方案，所以無不「實獲我心地「一致贊成，請其施諸實行。每星期日，他常在天主堂內講道，勸聽衆推愛天主之心以愛人，犧牲小我，用以成就大我，字字眞切，語語動人，往往以慈善事業難民問題爲結穴。隨后他就在接見室內；笑容可掬，愷悌慈祥地招待來賓，不論中外貴賤，老少男女，總可得着他的三數語，使人聽到心裹，覺着一種安慰。他那樣優遊自在，談笑風生，毫無倦容，超然物表地和人接談，忘却自己一週來的勞頓和困倦，使得你下决還想見他。這位神父，不但是吸引朋友的磁石，並且明瞭各個人的心理和需要。我曾經看見他用一隻手緊握住一對新婚夫婦說：「你待她好麼？你待他好麽？我希望你們時常來。「言罷藹然，好像慈母般的在關心兒輩的幸福。再有一位逃住租界的人，要知道他虹口產業的狀况，請饒神父便探究竟，明天饒氏歸來，從衣袋取出一片　盆碎磁，證明此君所有，皆成砲灰與瓦礫矣。總而言之，饒神父是憂苦者之安慰，貧窮者之救星，人類形神方面的困難問題，有了他就解決得不少。</p>
<p>饒氏失蹤抵滬後，曾發表談話：謂渠旅華甚久，以巾國爲第二故鄉，其愛中國之熱誠，不亞於華人之愛中國。此次在美捐款，已達七十萬元美金，一切費用，均由經募者墊助，決不在捐款中動用分毫，此種「涓滴歸公」之精神，眞足發人深省與效法。他不但是「中國之友，」「難民之父，」並且還是一位愛國的「中國人！」</p>

<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>吾國以科學落後，事業受制於人，當此國難嚴重，所受痛苦允不可言喻，愛國入士多痛心疾首於國家提倡科學之不早，致有噬臍不及之患。然就事實而言，吾國政府已於七八十年以前知科學爲國防之切需，加以提倡。特倡導不得其方，竟致毫釐千里，一敗塗地耳。如江南製造局，馬江船廠及各省之兵工廠，乃爲擴充海陸軍而設也，漢陽鐵廠爲軍備亦爲實業也，招商局爲振興航業收回航權也，甘肅之織呢廠爲大興工業利用天產也。乃爲時未久，卽衰萎不振，或倒閉停滯，毫無利國裕民之效者。蓋吾國人徒知實用科學之爲貴，一間以求成效，欲速見小之極，摹仿抄襲，學步傚顰，而於根本研究創造日新之純粹科學，毫不消音，結果所　辦之事業，徒耗國家之鉅資，竟致得不償失也。純粹科學爲實用科學之基礎，欲享科學之利益。絕不能離純粹科學而徒談實用，如數，理，化，動，植，地等學之研究，爲一切工程農醫等業所必需，稍有常識者，類能言之。愛迪生氏在電學上了明最富，然其實騐室中聘用多數之理化專家爲之助，美國奇異電機製造廠中雇用純粹科學尤衆，皆時時與電機工程師合作，以圖解決一切問題。其餘歐美各國之工廠醫院農業實騐塲以及所有國防實業等機關，無不有多數之純粹科學專家從事其間。純粹科學可以奠定實用之根基，解決實用之困難，實用科學遂得日新月異，造福邦家。今日吾國當抗戰時期，需要科學允殷，國人旣不能使純粹科學早日發達爲實用造其基，而今日所急需之實用科學仍不能不恃純粹科學爲之助，國人其有相當之認識，勿再蹈昔之覆轍乎！</p>
<h3 id="c92">多胞胎的話（一） <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 劉漢士</p>
<p>自從加拿大狄盎尼夫人（MIS.Dionne）於三年前產生了一胎五嬰之後，便創造了醫學史上的新紀錄，也可以說是奇蹟，爲的是有史以來，一胎五個的雖然生產過，但養活的却祇有狄家的五胞胎（Dionue　Quintuplets）。物以稀爲貴，這五位小千金的確轟動了全世界，據說這五位姊妹落地的時候，是小得像貓那麼大，後來由醫師加意撫養，就日見長大，現在巳是四歲了，長得十分健康，活潑，和別的小孩一樣，所不同的就是五位姊妹個個相像，爲免錯誤起見，除給她們呌上五個名字以外，衣服上，帽子上，鞋子上，還須縫上各人的名宇，這的確是很有趣的一件事。（上圖就是狄家五胞胎的五姊妹。）</p>
<p>原來狄家並非富有，這樣的人口興旺，實在有些尷尬，然而「有人斯有財」，狄家不但沒有受累，因此竟得世界聞名，大出風頭，家道小康，事實是這樣，自從狄夫人生產了「五千金」的消息傳出之後，遠遠近近的好奇人士，都想一飽眼福。加拿大人，美國人，不在話下；甚至有不遠千里從歐洲渡洋來參觀的也不少，於是乎狄家生涯鼎盛，戶限爲穿，門票收入，著實可觀，不但五個囡囡可以交由醫院撫育，有一看護服侍，醫師指導，狄氏夫婦也變成相當有了，誰說生女兒沒出息呢！</p>
<p>不但如此，這五位小千金，雖然還是嬰孩，可是已經上過幾次鏡頭，拍過幾張片子，成爲電影明星了，要是大家還記得的話，在不久以前，在上海大光明戲院映過的「五福臨門」，就是她們五姊妹傑作之一，不用說，這一筆酬金是一定很大的。狄家眞可說是人財兩旺了。還有一件可注意的事，就是本年六月間英王喬治和王后伊麗莎伯到加拿大巡幸時，在他們的行程節目中，據說有一項是預備接見這五位小寳寳的，這也是一件稀有的榮幸事。無怪白樂天要說「不重生男重生女」。</p>
<p>近來多胞胎的新聞，時有所聞，雙胞胎，三胞胎，不稀奇，四胞胎在美國最近就有兩起，一在潘西文尼亞州的比資堡（Pitteburgh,PennsyIvania）地方有秉娜蒂天人（MIis.Marie　Pennettiel）生三女一男，另一爲德克沙斯州加爾維斯墩（GalvestonTexa)的柏吉地夫人（MrsW.E．Badgett）產一胎四女，都取了J字起頭的名字，呌做Jeraldine　Jeanette,　Joyce，Joan，比狄夫人僅少生一個，也可說是異數，最近在耶穌復活節期內，意大利羅維哥（Rowgo）城某婦人，產一胎四男，爲相莫索里尼特贈童衣爲賀。</p>
<p>照生物學或遺傳學講，多胞胎有兩種；一種是「同性胎」（Lcenticals）是「異性胎」（Non-Identicals)。何謂同性胎？就是說所生的全是男，或全是女。異性胎則所生的或爲男或爲女，不必盡是同性。要明白道個緣由，我們得更作進一步的解釋。大家都知道受孕是怎樣一回事。簡單的說，就是由於男性的精蟲闖入女性的卵子，舉行受精作用之故。因爲男性的性染色體，有XY兩個不同的因子，就斷定這所受孕的是男或是女。通常女子每次只有一個卵子受精，所以生下的只是一個男或者一個女，那就是我們所常見的一胎一個生產。但是有時碰巧有二個，三個，或者四個卵子同時出現，同時各別的受精，那麽這胞內同時就有幾個小生命孕育着，生下來就是幾個不同性的嬰兒，這呌做「異性胎」。牠們胚胎情形，和一胎一子的相同，不過大家趕熱鬧，在一胎之內誕生罷了。至於同性胎就不然，牠的現象是一個卵子受了精後，在胎內自己分裂，成幾個集團，同時在胎內發育，因此所分得的遺傳性質完全相同，生下來就是同性，是男都是男，是女都是女，一直到長大成人，以至於死，除非受後天的環境影響，略的有些差異外，一切的一切，都彼此相同。上面所舉的例子，狄家五姊妹民，柏家四姊妹，意大利的四兄弟，都是同性胎，秉家四兄妹是異性胎，就遺傳研究講同性胎最有趣，最有研究的價値。</p>

<h3 id="c94">李白騎鯨 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 禾山</p>
<p>相傳李太白於醉中月夜泛舟，騎於鯨魚之背，以致沉沒。其地在今之采石磯。所謂鯨者即江豬也（一名江豚）此鯨最大者不過五六尺長，色黑，背圓而無鰭，脣部圓鈍，分佈於中國沿海及長江下游，時溯江而上，直達宜昌或入洞庭湖中，南京下關，大勝關江中，時見其出現，蕪湖左近江中亦時見之，往往有三四頭相聚游戲，出沒水面。太白確曾騎之與吾，未可知，然采石磯江中宜爲其出沒之地也。中國沿海尙有他種鯨魚。據今所知者：一，鬚鯨，色黑，體長二丈以上，口有鯨鬚，背上有鰭。二，羣鯨，色黑，體長一丈左右，背上有鰭，最喜結羣而行。三，白鯨，色白，體長不及一丈，脣部銳出，有背鰭。鯨之外部形體與魚相似，然皆係哺乳類，生長於水中者也。</p>

<p>食物中需要砒與其它毒質</p>
<p>食物中需要含砒霜。它的分量當然極小，甚至非普通化學分析法所能檢查。但若僅僅像霜花樣重的幾千分之一的質量而無之，必不足以保持人的健康。</p>
<p>其它毒原素，如鉛與錳亦是如此。據瓊斯（G.D.Jones）在美國農學工程報上說，這種原素在大多數的土中均有，不過數量極微，易被普通的耕種法所耗盡。要使植物根較易吸取它們，需把土壤掘至比普通的略深。瓊斯因此正在研究耕田的農具。他已造成一個，足以掘至三呎深云。</p>

<p>蟻也能像蜂刺人</p>
<p>據美國韋伯（N．A．Weber）敎授說有一種蟻也能像蜂刺人。他曾遇見過二次。有一决他在不列顚奇亞那，一個工蟻竟能將它的刺穿過厚呢的褲而刺傷他的膝。另有一次他在運河區，一個雌蟻爬進他的袖內，刺傷他的手臂。這種刺的毒性與一種毒蜂的刺相似，可以歷五小時之久云。</p>

<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>假使說張伯倫的對德義宜霄不再讓步，可以作爲獅子吼，那末羅斯福的向希特勒與墨索里尼要求提供保證，在十年之內不侵略他國領土，就可以作爲晴天霹靂。在這轟然一聲之下，當然有人在手忙脚亂着，故意裝作若無其事的，無非還不甘示弱罷了。</p>
<p>這一巨聲在歐洲究竟有什麽反響，不久我們就可以聽到，現在姑且存而不論，而接着這巨聲而來的，却便是和雲陣一般的艦隊，由大西洋開入了太平洋·太平洋這一邊的遠東國家，受到了什麼影響，我想總是我們目前所最應該注意的吧。</p>
<p>按道兩天的報紙看來，美國外交委員會主席畢德曼，已一再主張制裁日本，這一次艦隊的調動，頗足以作爲這個主張的後盾。參議員威廉金的言論，更爲露骨，以爲美國海軍調調動，旨在阻止日本對於菲列濱或荷屬東印度的窺伺。而其他「權威方面」，則認日本第二攻擊目標爲香港，美國艦隊調回太平洋之後，可使日本稍戢其野心。因此，東京路透電，謂此間海軍界大爲驚訝」，可見不是隨便的表現了。</p>
<p>據我的猜想，民治國的聯合，已經完成，所對付的，決不僅是歐洲的德義，而遠東的日本也一定在內·而對付的方法呢，則似乎已經分任其職：歐洲方面，如果德義發動，則由英法蘇聯等國，包圍痛擊，而美國則在軍火及經濟上作後盾；遠東方面，如果日本再進一步，則由美國就近制裁，而英法各國的殖民地，則在種種方面予以便利。換言之，大西洋東岸，英法蘇聯爲主，美國爲副；太平洋西岸，美國爲主，英法蘇聯爲副，這樣分頭解決各法西斯國。</p>
<p>如果世界大戰終不幸而發生，我的猜想總不致離事實太遠吧。因爲歐洲國家對於遠東，鞭長莫及，只好將太平洋西岸的事情，託之於地位及一切力量都優越的美國，是情勢所必然的。</p>
<p>當然，對於遠東方面，蘇聯也不會置身事外的。不過她的專責似乎在大陸，不像美國專責在太平洋，所以太平洋上的演出，我們還要期待着美國。</p>

<p>天，像寡婦般扳着臉，怪悶氣。</p>
<p>——「報吿！敵軍通過西面朱家莊有向這裹進撲模樣。」</p>
<p>一個年靑小販，喘着氣說</p>
<p>——「多少人？」</p>
<p>——「二百多！」</p>
<p>——「哼！」</p>
<p>小販走了，遺留下一個暫時的靜默；過後，馮營長下命令：召集部隊，抵抗！</p>
<p>張小三和趙明是機關槍手</p>
<p>張小三望着烏黑的槍洞，洞裏似乎有着異樣的神秘：</p>
<p>「媽媽的，老弟今天帮忙呵！」</p>
<p>趙明望着張小三在笑。小三看見不好意思，搭訕着說：</p>
<p>「不是嗎？全靠它把鬼子打回老家去！」</p>
<p>「不許響，小三！」</p>
<p>「達達達——」</p>
<p>敵人又在晦氣子彈一，一溜輕烟在空中飄游。</p>
<p>一簇敵人向這裏衝過來。</p>
<p>上而下命令：「開火射擊！」</p>
<p>張小三的機槍口噴出火花。</p>
<p>「媽媽的，這些死鬼！」</p>
<p>敵人有幾個倒下去，然而仍向這裏奔，隱的發着一片喊聲。</p>
<p>「——兄弟，——我們是一家……」</p>
<p>「我們不打自己人——呀！」</p>
<p>「——兄弟，停止開火呀</p>
<p>「——我們來歸附——的……』</p>
<p>張小三聽見了，趙明也聽見了，一般兄弟都聽見了，心裹想：「怪哪！」</p>
<p>「達達達……」</p>
<p>敵人不絕的倒下去，在敵人的背後，也閃着密集的火花</p>
<p>上邊命令來了：「停止射擊！」</p>
<p>敵人愈走愈近了，這邊喊</p>
<p>「放下槍下不然開火！」</p>
<p>一枝枝槍掉在地上，敵人背後跟着火星。</p>
<p>「同胞！歡迎！」</p>
<p>「兄弟，我們又到了母親的懷抱裏來了。」</p>
<p>敵人—不，現在是一條戰錢上的兄弟了！那個隊長握着我們馮營長的手，報國的熱血在掌心裹交流。……</p>
<p>張小三驚奇地張着嘴巴，望着黑臉膛的隊長，心裏像一僩油鍋，煎着一個興奮的奇想</p>
<p>「大哥！張小三突然一喊</p>
<p>墨臉膛的隊長掉過頭，目光盯住張小三，闊的嘴脣在顫抖：</p>
<p>「小三，你在這兒！」</p>
<p>他們擁抱了，興奮地流出眼淚，血管裏流着忠義的血球</p>
<p>張小三心裹數着：七年，七年的離別呵，今天方在戰塲相見！</p>

<p>盧先生又在那兒發表他的高見了！頭，來回的搖着，額角上的靑筋突了起來：</p>
<p>「唉！現在的中國人眞糟：唔：所以我說：從十歲以上的都該死掉：是的：都該死掉：」他特意把最後一句重說一遍。頭又得意的擺了兩下。</p>
<p>那你呢？你也死掉？那多可惜呀！一有人在開玩笑的難他了。</p>

<p>「哈：可是你那兩位令嬡：問人要糖的時候，那種本領不亞於以前那些善刮地皮的官僚呢！」</p>
<p>「唔：那：那：」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈：」惹得哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>盧先生才不過三十多歲的年靑人，却老愛發表這種迂腐的無稽空談。有時要是同事們問他：</p>
<p>「那我們的老校長呢？也死掉？」</p>
<p>他就會輕蔑的說：「哦！那當然１老實說：這些五六十的老頭子，都不行：你看那兩個僞政府裹的漢奸，不儘是五六十歲的？：」</p>
<p>「可是：盧先生：你令尊大人高壽？」</p>

<p>盧先生的令尊都六十多了，可是還不辭艱苦的離了家跟着政府往西去，爲國家効勞；倒是盧先生自己，在政府剛遷到漢口就說：</p>
<p>「唔…我該辭職了！……上海還有家眷在那兒呢…」於是他跑回來了！讓他老父親一個人留在那兒。</p>
<p>當人家說他該到內地去爲國効勞，和照料他老父的時候，他又要漲紅了臉囁嚅的說：</p>

<p>在時間底過程中，由於外界事物底千變萬化，不斷地刺激和反應，生命自然也隨着更換它底內容；本質上局部的起着量底增减，到某一階段，形成整個質上的死亡和新生。</p>
<p>生命底眞意義是在於創造。但創造祇是一種必需的手段，用來完成享受「創造價値」的享受的。所以要不停地享受，得先不停地創造。這樣，才不致把生命無謂地虛擲。</p>
<p>吝嗇生命的，是懦夫。浪費生命的，是瘋人。不知生命爲何物的，是白癡、認生命爲幻象的，是幽靈。</p>
<p>如果作爲一個時代前哨的戰士的話，那當對生命珍惜，緊握着，不能片刻兒放鬆；沉醉在信仰，理想上面。有時也應把生命孤注一擲，殉而後已！</p>

<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>從前倪雲林雅士，因爲不肯替張士信作畫，有一天在太湖裏被張士信捉了起來，鞭打幾死。可是他在被鞭打時，不發一言。有人問他原故，他說：一開口就俗了。</p>
<p>不得了，這樣的雅士，連性命都不顧，眞正少見。然而這樣的做作，不也有一些太雅之嫌吾？因爲在我看來，不開口只能算作强硬不屈，是個好漢，與雅無關，如果存心要以此爲雅，就未免太雅而成俗了。</p>
<p>太雅成俗，正如儒林外史中所說的「雅得太俗」一樣。常時一般斗方名士，動不動就飲酒看花，吟詩作賦，自命風雅，於是給吳敬梓大大地嘲笑了一陣，至今當爲話柄。</p>
<p>話說這種雅習，到了今天，似乎流風餘韻，依然未絕，或者竟是變本加厲，有行必雅，無事肯俗。別的不必說，即以幾個人的台甫雅篆，別號筆名而言，早已竭盡雅之奇觀，不能不使人嘆爲雅之極致。有一個時期，名字總用花鳥蟲魚來代表，而以哀怨愁苦的形容詞來陪襯。這可以說是軟派的雅。現在呢，總算變了，都用□□□□，□口口口這些字眼來取名了。這也許可以說是硬派吧。</p>
<p>我不是說，這些名字根本不雅。適得其反，我是承認牠們的雅的。可是一人始倡，多人從夙，仟何雅事，都成了俗不可耐，正如宋之蘇東坡是雅人，多雅事，明之唐伯虎張孟晋之流，邯鄲學步，扭揑作態，就使人要發嘔了。</p>
<p>要一定專爲雅與俗下定義，當然不是容易的·不過我說，這裏面似乎也有一些範圍，除了始倡者雅，從風者俗以外，還有：有意者俗，無心者雅。倪雲林之俗，我就爲了他的有意，他本來是元末明初人，正合了肉蒲團上所說，元人是每一個人都有一個別號的，所以他號爲雲林子，也就是他俗的表徵之一。至於他的故意嗜潔，無非學學米元章，也徒見其俗氣熏人耳。黨紀先生的在北京作詩，在河內作詩，正可以作如是觀：附庸風雅，俗俗俗！</p>
<p>莫君利哀——仿高君爾基的雅情——所寫的「裝腔作勢」，就是爲這些雅人寫照的，我想要收集這項材料，恐怕古今中外，不知多少，正可以車載「之」斗量，汗牛「之」充楝吧——用兩個「之」字，文氣便雅。</p>
<p>不過雅事只於文人有份，不識字的渾人是無份的；因此旣有文人的太雅血成俗，也就有了渾人的太俗而成雅。黨太尉的銷金帳裏，羊羔美酒，就是這個明證，而梁山黑旋風開口老子，閉口鐵牛，實在嫵媚可愛，端的不俗，就是魯迅筆底下的阿Q，幾聲我要…………，我也認爲是近代第一雅人。爲什麼呢？也不過爲了他們一片天眞，無心於雅，而所言所行，前不見古人，後不見來者，却自然地妙絕千古，俗得太雅耳。</p>
<p>文人中畢竟黃山谷是有點道理的：他到了宣州，有人請他寫字，他來者不拒，有求心應；有人因爲他給了俗人，爲他可惜，他京笑着說，有不俗的人，引一個來看看看。這話眞正痛快極了！反過來說，誰是雅人呢？誰不是俗人呢？於比，我們也可以看出一些雅與俗的究竟來。</p>
<p>我時常聽見人們說，文章要做得一雅俗共賞」，方爲妙文。這話，我有些不相信，因爲雅能賞，俗未必能賞，俗能賞的，不一定雅能賞。因此，我想，也許「雅俗不共賞」妙文吧。至於我這掃不妙文，旣難逍雅，又難諧俗，也就只好說「雅俗共不賞」了。</p>

<p>一九三九年之紐約世界展覽會，將於四月三十日開幕，至十月三十日閉幕。在此半年期內＼預計參觀人眾，將不下五千萬人，祇就海外各地來此之遊客而言，為數亦將在三百萬以上。會場位於長島沿福魯星海灣一帶新填就之湖沼澤地，長約三哩半，廣約一千二百余英畝，建築工程，歷時二載，費用計一萬六千五百萬元。參加展覽者計一千五百單位，其中包括</p>
<p>六十有二國，為前此歷次展覽會所示有之盛況。據會中當局宣稱：此會對於國際新親善之促進，有極可寶貴之貢獻雲。此次展覽會與歷來之會有一顯著不同之點，即以前大半注重於過雲出品之　陳，而此會則企圖為未來之預示也。故其正式名稱，即為</p>
<p>明日之世界。該支之各種建築，及其中所陳列者，對於此點，在在均求合此點，蓋會中各項建築，即為其最顯明之特色。其中設計大部採用「功用式」，對於各項建築之用途，皆用粗壯之線條表示。色調方面，皆採用鮮明奪目之藍紅黃三色，較大建築之外部，多建有著色之壁垣。會中有一中心點，可俯瞰全場各地，該處有二種</p>
<p>特異建築物：一為直徑二百尺之發光圓球，如為球下池中射出之水柱所支；另一為高達七百尺之尖塔，全場十七哩之街道，三十四喱之行人便道，及八大區域，皆以該處為中心，而向四面展佈焉。各大區域各有不同之色調，且其色澤，去會中心愈遠，則愈濃厚，故參觀者得依四周建築之顏色，而決定其所在之地位。參觀者更可乘轉動之梯，入發光大圓球之內部，而登其中緩緩轉動之兩座月臺，府　該處所佈置之</p>
<p>明日之城市，對於將來工業都市之情況，可略具概念，並可覩其黎明，黃昏及晚間不同之景象。其上部則刻有美麗之圖畫，顯示人類及文明之進步，並可聆取千余人合唱之歌聲。會中最大之建築，當為　道大廈，曾在美國行駛之「蘇格蘭加冕」號機車，將陣列該處。波蘭，蘇聯，法國，瑞士，及義大利諸國，亦均運來最新式之火車，在會展覽。該大廈中有</p>
<p>圓形戲院一所，能容四千人，將表演美國自昔馬車時代至今日流線型機車之運輪歷史。各汽車製造公司，皆不惜巨資，搜集最驚奇之展覽品，聞其中某公司對於建築一項，已用去一千萬元之钜，所佔地位，共僅三十萬方尺而已。惟此項房屋，自無身疑為全場巨擘之一。並由著名戲院建築師治迪斯設計，建造極為生動之雛型，名稱為「明日之大路與地平線」，計長一哩之三分之一。參觀者可坐於活動之椅上，即可窺見未來公路制度之情形。另一</p>
<p>大汽車公司則建築長逾半哩之架空公路，環繞該大廈之四周。參觀者將在該路之上，全場景象得一覽無遺焉。運輸區域中央共有汽車鐵路航空及海軍四座大廈，海軍大夏之入口兩傍，建有像真之船首，其余各區之名稱，為「政府」「生產」「分配」「交通」「商業制度」「食物」「衣飾化裝」及「公眾利益」，皆由會場中心分佈四面。此外更有會場中主要大道，名為「憲政蔭道」，由會場中心起，直達聯邦大廈門前之國際湖止，計長半哩，下星期日羅斯福總統將在該大廈之石階上發表其開幕演說焉。聯邦大廈之兩翼，為</p>
<p>為際堂兩所，包括許多小型之房屋，即六十二國之展覽會所也。惟有六國，均之展覽會所也。惟有六國，均自建專館。其中以英國者最為偉大，有銅製壯麗之門戶，通「光榮」及「成績」兩堂。此外更有金屬堂，陳列關於工程之展覽品，民治堂及戲院一處。加拿大亦有自建房屋，陳列其礦產及農林產物，愛爾蘭之建築，則大部份採用玻璃及金屬為材料。澳洲紐絲綸及南羅特西亞島，亦均於國際堂內佔一席地。各外國政府之投資總額，約計</p>
<p>二千五百萬元。外國區域內有二十四國之餐館，可容食客四萬三千人，會中最有價值之建築，依其內容而論，則應屬藝術館所展覽之名畫五百幀，共值三千萬元；又珍品陳列館所展覽之寶石，亦值五百萬元。聞會場中許多壯麗偉大之建築，將祇有兩處垂諸永久：其一為紐約大廈，因該市長意欲留作本年夏季市政廳之用，此後或將改為第二</p>
<p>梅迪蓀公園；另一處為噴泉湖中可容萬人之水上圓形戲場，在開會期內，將由前世界運動會游泳冠軍霍爾姆女士等每日表演水上驚奇技術，晚間則在該處燃放各種美麗之煙火。會中之娛樂區佔地二百八十英畝，會場中其余各處增多於每埸十時閉幕，而此區則將延至深夜二時，內有各種引人入勝之創見遊藝，並另劃一處為</p>
<p>兒童嬉遊處。據目下估計，紐約以外各地人民之來參觀者，以每人平均費用百元計算，約須用去十五萬萬元。其用途之分配如下：娛樂三萬二千五百萬元，飲食三萬二千五百萬元，住宿三萬萬元，購物二萬萬元，本市車費一萬五千萬元，人事七千五百萬元，交通一千五百萬元；惟當局方面對於參觀者亦給予各種優待，例如有欲參觀紐約及舊金山兩處之展覽會者，旅費特別減少，鐵路公司亦宣佈一種參觀兩會者之回來特別票價，並規定環遊美國一週，車費只收九十元，而公共汽車，則更減為七十元雲（路透社十六紐約電）</p>
<h3 id="c104">「公事」與「私交」 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>對『公事』與『私交』這兩個名詞，恐怕不必需要筆者詳細地來解釋，讀者們就可以了然吧。所謂『公事』，就是專指一般國家官署的公共機關，與洋行，銀行，商家，店鋪等等的公共團體所執行的職務而言；所以，在事實上，我們也可以把『公事』稱作『公務』。所謂『私交』者，自然是指一般人在個人方面的事情，或者指私下情面了。直接從這兩個名詞的字眼上看來，我們當可知道：『公事』與『私交』，乃是截然不同地兩樣東西，我們既不能夠以『公事』來論『私交』，也不能夠以『私交』來論『公事』。</p>
<p>我們在『辦公事』的時候，必須要具有小心，謹慎，熱烈，勤勞，與忠誠等幾種氣質。尤其是一般所謂『公務員』的人們，他們身為了國家的精神，鼓舞起他們所有的氣魄，最起碼應該履行他們的責任，和應該做的一切事情。所以，也可說，我們對於『公事』必須要有一種『為公服務』『為公犧牲』的觀念。</p>
<p>在這裏，請諸位不要誤會了，我們對『私交』就不需要忠誠，不需要熱烈。不過，實際上如果我們對『私交』稍為馬虎上些，真的也無有大礙，因為從『私交』所生的影響，只限制於私下個人的範圍的緣故。反之，假使我們在『公事』上隨隨便便，那末，它不但會對私人，並且，還很容易對一大嬌群的『公眾』發生影響。因此，我們寧願以『辦公事』的手段心思，來應付『私交』，卻萬萬不可以把『私交』的情面來應付『公事』。然而，在事實上，忽略了這幾句的真義，而常常在把『公事』與『私交』合併在一起的人，正不知道有多少。他們會說：『我與你連這些面子都會沒有嗎？管他媽的『公事』不『公事』，你就應該幫過我這一個忙呀！』而所謂『公務員』的，也真的會回答起：「那有什麼呀！」之類的答語。於是，就在這種情況下，大者如誤國誤民的舉動成功了，小者如偷竊，盜取，捲逃……等等惡劣的情事也發生了；總之，一般人因太重視了『私交』，而將『公事』的尊嚴，打得粉碎。</p>
<p>現在，我就要指出這一種種『私交』　『公事』的習氣的要不得：尤其是在當今祖國正在艱苦的事業的時候，試問，我們為了些微的面子關係，應該將『公事』疏忽，而予一般的公眾以極大的損害嗎？所以，在這裏，我謹以十二分的至誠，希望每一個中國國民都能夠廣大地將『為公犧牲』的精神發揚開來。我們要知道：今日這個時期，已不是重『情面』，重『私交』的時期了。我們應該注重『公事』，為『公』，為『國』，切實地幹一些抗戰的工作！</p>

<p>— 揚眉</p>
<p>抗戰迄今，已閱二十一月，日本雖憑恃它自己軍械的精良，在形式上得到了勝利。但所獲得的衹是幾道交通線和幾個城市而已。廣大的地面，仍在華軍之手，而戰線又是異常的延長和散漫，犯兵深入之忌，如果一旦全線反攻，各地都遭受截擊，聯絡中斷，首尾不能相顧，必成土崩瓦解之果。然而，當初的日本掀起荒蘆溝橋事變時，原想佔些小便宜的，萬萬料不到會給它一個「長期抵抗」的最致命的報復。戰事推演到現在，泥足愈陷愈深，窘態畢露。而自己的常備軍，後備軍，鮮臺日軍，都抽調上了前線去作戰，還覺得不夠分配，而在自己的「王道樂土」中，又碰來碰去是中國軍隊，得了這塊失了那塊，弄得頭暈目眩，疲於奔命，可見日軍崩潰之期已不在遠，我們看下列電訊，更可得到有力的證明。</p>
<p>據日前東京朝日新聞截稱，華中日司令官櫻吉少將宣言：「請中國政府以勁旅來中原一決雌雄，勿再東奔西竄，自失國格」雲雲。</p>
<p>櫻吉少將的宣言，和去年十二月十九日華南日司令安籐所雲「原蔣委員長以軍人資格，來粵作殊死戰」一語，暗相吻合，先後一轍，可知已達日暮途窮之境，離崩潰期不遠了！</p>
<p>法文上海日報前會　以歐戰時霞飛將軍在比境戰敗後，悉數後退，卒獲得瑪納河的空前勝利，的是確切不移之論。這幾天華中各地反攻之捷，勢如破竹。就是抗戰第二階段由敗為勝的前奏曲！</p>
<p>由此，我們知道櫻吉的宣言，無異是崩潰前的哀鳴。</p>

<p>朱愛人接到了吳君素的電話，她便與何家兩位小姐商量，我們到底去不去呢？在蘇州鑒別的當兒，吳君不素早已約過，她們答應她說『一定來！一定來』怎麼現在可以說不去呢？而且何儷玉等，也很喜歡看學校的演劇，在美國的時候，她們在學校中，也曾演過。朱愛人實在是忙於醫務，無暇及此，也並非是不好娛樂。她們本來的計算，是星期日的上午，到自由村去的。此刻吳君素的電話，是星期六的夜裏演劇。星期六的夜裏，本來可以休憩娛樂，不致於妨礙工作的。但是看完了戲，深夜還回到安樂鎮嗎？吳君素一定留他們在那裏，不放她們回來了。一問吳君素，果然在電話裏說：『一切都給你們預備好了，不嫌怠慢，就住在我的寓所裏。況且我已約好了　雲姊了，她也住在我這裏，我們正好作長夜之談。希望你們早一些來，在我那裏吃夜飯，吃了夜飯以後，我們再去看戲。』她在電話裏如此的約定了，似乎不容她們不雲。她們一計算，只好星期六下午到了蘇州，住在吳君素那裏，到明天星期日，再由蘇州到自由村去，也不至於有所妨礙。當時便答應了吳君素，星期六下午一准來。吳君素當然高興，又叮囑他們來吃夜飯，不要太遲。到了明天，已是星期六，朱愛人把醫院裏一天的工作，料理清楚了，在下午四點鐘光景，仍舊坐了朱愛人的汽車，來到蘇州東吳大學。到蘇州時，辰光還早，但已是夕陽一抹，斜掛林稍，她們便尋到吳君素的寓所來。原來吳君素的家中，都住在上海，而她個人住在學校旁邊。因為在東吳大學校的周圍，建築了不少小洋房，這些小洋房，都帶了園林式的。那是學校中建設了這些房屋，以供教職員們所居住，房子是三層樓，並不寬大。但是供一個小家庭居住，也很覺舒適的了。他們服務於東吳大學的人，有兩個合借一屋的，有一人獨佔一屋的。雖然也收他們一些兒租金，卻是非常低廉，差不多只收半價。一切設備，也很完全，如電燈，電話，水管，水汀等等，應有盡有，這是學校中優待這班教員們的。（九〇）</p>

<p>— 晏然</p>
<p>在「王先生吃飯難」中，除了暗示觀衆，社會環境的勢利，和謀生的不易之外，它的噱頭，也是很能使一般觀衆，笑痛肚皮的。</p>
<p>例如：王先生在一所女子中學上踝的時候，居然大讀其「女孝經」，大唸其「女子應三從四德，在家從父，出嫁從夫，夫死從子………的爛調，竟把全課堂的女生，一個個都睡了下去，及至校長走來，他才如夢初醒的，發覺學生們都已睡去了。在這裹可知敎育要抓住時代的需要，而後才能引起學生們的興趣。</p>
<p>在王先生謀生困難，欲尋短見的一幕中，他把一根繩子，掛在樑上，而後再套在嘴吧下面，踢去了脚底下的櫈子，身子便在空中搖來搖去的做出了各種的姿勢，在這幕鏡頭里，眞引得觀衆大笑了一陣。</p>
<p>在山窮水盡之際，王先生忽然接到好友小陳的信，介紹他做綏靖公署的秘書，這一來，眞把他喜極了。甚至在房間裏笑得大跳起來，連跳了幾個圈子，口裹更不住的唱着小調，表情的逼眞，的確形容出失業者一旦得業的在歡。</p>
<p>當他走進綏靖公署的時候，傳達員的始而勢利，繼而恭敬，終而因他遺失了介紹信，拿不出眞憑實據而重新放出了一副勢利的面孔，耍把他趕出，這中間翻覆的演出，澈底的揭穿了人心的勢利，世態的炎凉，我們在禁不住的失笑之餘，更應該把它當作社會哲學看</p>
<p>全劇演來，湯傑飾王先生，可謂最是賣力，尤光照飾傳達員，也能恰到好處，滑稽百出；其他各演員的表情，都可說是相當的成功。</p>
<p>總之，這片我們不但應該把它當做滑稽影片看，有時更得把它當作一部社會影片看。因爲這其中的確包含着不少的人生哲學，和處世經驗呢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">China Determined to Fight to the End, Striving for Survival, Independence, and Freedom; Advocating Surrender is a Spiritual Death Sentence; Only by Dealing a Fatal Blow to Japan Can There Be Hope for Peace; The Strategy of Resistance Has Been Decided Five Years Ago and Will Generally Not Be Changed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) After the memorial week on the 17th, many Chinese and foreign journalists asked Chairman Chiang the following questions. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reporter: Some people now say that Konoe's statement on "establishing a new order in East Asia" can be used as the basis for peace between China and Japan, and do not consider it to be a condition for national subjugation. How does the Chairman think this should be dealt with?</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang: "Establishing a new order in East Asia" is just a new term for Japan's annexation of China. In my speech on December 26 last year, I have already analyzed the enemy's aggressive ambitions in detail, so there is no need to say more. If Konoe's statement is interpreted as a "peace" condition, then there is no need for the word "surrender" in the dictionary. This is an extremely shameless joke, not only will it not happen today, but it will never happen. The purpose of China's resistance is to protect the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. If this goal cannot be achieved in one day, our struggle will not stop for a day. Now, the longer the war continues, the more Japan's weaknesses are exposed, and its ambitions become more obvious. This is the so-called "the dagger is revealed when the map is unrolled to the end" principle. Looking at the actions of the Japanese warlords, anyone can know that they want to take the life of our entire nation and make us their slaves forever. Konoe's so-called "establishing a new order in East Asia" is Japan's vicious plan to dominate East Asia, not only to eliminate China, but also to eliminate all forces of all countries in the Pacific. Japan's aggressive desires are advancing with the times, and China's understanding of the progress of Japan's ambitions is also becoming clearer, so our will to resist is becoming stronger. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no room for peace, and it will never be shaken by any clever, hypocritical theory of surrender. Our entire nation is united, and for those who advocate such an extremely shameless argument, I believe that the effectiveness of our Chinese principles, morality, and conscience will be greater than the effectiveness of legal sanctions. Such people have already declared their death sentence in spirit and are really not worth mentioning. As for the state's punishment, it depends on their future actions. Reporter: May I ask how the Sino-Japanese war can be resolved?</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang: This question depends on how the facts evolve in the future. We have only been resisting for twenty-two months, which is less than two years, and Japan's international status as a first-class country has already been lowered to the status of a second-class country by our resistance. If we intensify our resistance, according to the facts of the past, I believe that in the near future, it will inevitably make his current status as a second-class country unstable. In this way, on the one hand, his national strength will be more exhausted and his status will be lower, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our own strength to reach a favorable time and a favorable terrain, and give him a fatal blow, so that he can truly recognize the power of China's resistance, and then there will be hope for peace. I believe that this is not only possible, but as long as we work hard, the arrival of this time will be very soon. Apart from this, if we want to restore peace between China and Japan, then unless the Japanese warlords have a thorough awakening and voluntarily give up their aggression and fundamentally change their traditional policies. If they do not fundamentally abandon their aggressive policies and cannot eradicate their so-called "new order in East Asia" dream, then not only will the Sino-Japanese war absolutely not end, but East Asia will never have peace. Today, any descendant of the Yellow Emperor with a conscience in the Chinese nation, no matter how low their level of knowledge is, will never say that Konoe's "new order in East Asia" is not a condition for national subjugation to annex China. The enemy's ambitions and the Chinese people's understanding have become clear to this point. If there are still people who argue that Konoe's statement is not a condition for the demise of China, and think that it is still possible to make peace, then what is this if not seeking to surrender and betray the country? To put it bluntly, such people not only do not hesitate to be traitors, but are simply willing to be slaves of Japan.</p>
<p>Reporter: How will the war situation evolve in the future? Will China still adhere to the original strategy of protracted war to the end? Chairman Chiang: Five years ago, I had a speech on "Resisting Foreign Insults and Revitalizing the Nation," discussing our strategy of resistance when a war breaks out between China and Japan. If you just read my speech, you can know that the strategy we are using today was decided five years ago. We will never change the entire strategy and consistent policy of "trading space for time, accumulating small victories into big victories." At that time, we decided that if we did not fight, we would not fight, and if we fought, we must persevere to the end. Even if the entire country is completely lost, we have the confidence and confidence to recover it. At that time, we thought from the most unfavorable situation and made the final decision. At that time, it was estimated that it would take the enemy sixteen months to invade our eighteen provinces. Now that we have been resisting for twenty-two months, we can still maintain many complete provinces. Even the provinces that have been occupied have only lost a few cities and strongholds. In those provinces, all the land and people are still under the control of our army. The enemy not only has nothing to gain, but is also following our planned plans, falling into the quagmire and stepping into the road of collapse. In the future, they will be subject to our final fatal blow anytime and anywhere. Therefore, today, in terms of the overall situation of the war of resistance, we must not observe the final success or failure of the war of resistance with the gains and losses of a few cities and strongholds. After everyone understands our consistent policy and the entire strategy, they will no longer be deceived by those shameless traitorous theories that speak for the enemy. (18th dispatch)</p>

<p>Everything related to international phenomena is becoming increasingly complex; if one only looks at it occasionally, one will inevitably feel dazzled and unable to understand it; but because the problem is at hand and the interests are closely related, I wonder how many people are eager to understand it. For ordinary people, without basic common sense, they will not know where the problem comes from; without continuous attention, they will not know the recent ups and downs and evolution of the problem. If one goes further from the phenomena to seek the future trends, it is certainly not easy to say. British diplomacy has always been praised by the world, because the British have an almost innate talent for international intelligence; the national government has a long history, not to mention. However, enduring humiliation and seeking perfection at Munich still did not help the failure of the appeasement policy; the Conservative Party gentlemen not only respectfully kept their distance from Communist Russia, but also hated it like poisonous snakes and beasts, but now they are rushing to Moscow, fearing that they will be too late; for Eastern Europe, they manipulate it when it is convenient, and abandon it when they cannot manipulate it, but now they are generously giving Poland and other countries guarantees without shirking great burdens; all these are recent masterpieces of Britain, how can British diplomacy be unpredictable? If, a few months ago, one asked a British person with international intelligence whether the appeasement policy would be humiliated by Germany and Italy, and Germany and Italy would be subjected to restraint, Britain would pay tribute to Soviet Russia, and bear a heavier responsibility in Eastern Europe than Soviet Russia, they would scoff and regard the questioner as unbelievable, because these are all questions that violate international common sense. In just a few days, all the phenomena are outside the original common sense; thus it can be seen that matters related to international affairs are difficult to say. However, international affairs are not without principles and cannot be said at all. All joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, ultimately cannot escape the principles of interests. This is certainly an old saying, but one may be deceived by temporary phenomena and ignore the principles, or one may work hard but achieve little because of ignoring the principles. Let's prove it with recent events in the Far East.</p>
<p>The other day, English leaflets were found among the English and French in Shanghai, attacking England and France in the name of the Chinese Communist Party, saying that England and France are enemies of China. Anti-British slogans in Chinese were also found in the occupied areas of China. These two things, regardless of the existence of different ideologies in China, regardless of the language used for expression, in short, cannot be wrongly attributed to the Chinese. Why? Because it violates the principles of interests. China is resisting Japan in order to seek the freedom and survival of the nation. China initiates it, and no other country can instigate it, nor can any other country prevent it. England, France, and Soviet Russia sympathize with China for justice. This kind of motivation should not be ignored; however, the reason for assisting China is still above justice. If Japan destroys China, England, France, and Soviet Russia will all suffer; if China defeats Japan, England, France, and Soviet Russia will all enjoy the fruits; if England, France, and Soviet Russia sit back and watch China fighting the enemy alone without providing assistance, the war will last longer and become more cruel, and England, France, and Soviet Russia will suffer a worse impact; if England, France, and Soviet Russia assist China in fighting the enemy, the common interests of China, England, France, and Soviet Russia will become more and more brilliant. Those who invade China are China's enemies; those who help China are China's friends. Interests are clear, and friends and enemies are clear. How can any words be used to reverse or change them? Clarity is seen by all, how can any surgery be used to cover up or confuse it? Therefore, although anti-British slogans are written in Chinese, the Chinese authorities are not blamed; although the leaflets attacking England and France are in the name of the Chinese Communist Party, the British Reuters is happy to transmit the Chinese Communist Party's words of denial. Only those who ignore the principles of interests and do this, not only have no effect, but only expose their hard work and achieve little. Not only these kinds of things have happened, but Japanese newspapers and magazines often express doubts about the sincere unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China; the Japanese authorities even attribute their failure in aggression to the assistance of various countries to China, and regard the assistance to China as unexpected. Their intention seems to be: the plan of aggression does not assume the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, nor does it assume the assistance of various countries to China. The facts are beyond the assumptions, so the difficulties and failures are beyond the plan. In fact, the internal unity of China and the external support are by no means due to emotions or propaganda, but a necessary phenomenon that conforms to the principles of interests; they are only blinded by profit and ignore it. Following this to infer general international phenomena, no matter how complex they are, no matter how the future evolution will tend to go, no matter how many changes will emerge endlessly and be impossible to predict or assert; however, according to where the principles lie, those who oppose aggression will inevitably respond to each other and become closer because of shared fortunes and misfortunes; the aggressors will inevitably suffer defeat because they may turn against each other due to conflicting interests and must become more and more isolated. According to this fixed understanding, one will be able to grasp a fixed view of the chaotic international situation without being confused!</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Cross Border to Attack Mengzi</p>
<h3 id="e5">External Affairs Has Aroused Attention From French Authorities; Air Force Headquarters Lists Important Evidence; Attack on Eurasia Aircraft is Further Proof <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese Air Force Headquarters issued a statement today stating that the Japanese aircraft participating in the air raid on Mengzi on the Dian-Vietnam Railway on April 13 flew through French airspace to reach their destination. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has aroused the attention of the French and Vietnamese authorities to this cross-border incident. According to the statement issued by the headquarters, the Japanese aircraft participating in the air raid on Mengzi on April 13 took off from Weizhou Island in Tokyo Bay, flew through French Vietnam and Laojie on the Dian-Vietnam border, flew directly to Gejiu west of Mengzi, and then turned east to bomb Mengzi. The following locations can prove what we said: (1) The air defense watchtowers in Wenshan (Kaihua) and Xisha (both transliterated above), near the southwest corner of Yunnan Province, did not see enemy aircraft flying back and forth on that day. According to the above two places, they are on the direct route from the Japanese air base on Weizhou Island to Diannan, where Mengzi is located. (2) Zhennanguan on the Guizhou-Vietnam border first saw the Japanese aircraft that bombed Mengzi, and then saw it in Laojie on the Dian-Vietnam border, but Wenshan and Xisha clearly did not see it fly over, which proves that the Japanese aircraft must have taken the nearby route through Vietnam to reach Mengzi. Another proof is that Eurasia Company's mail aircraft No. 19 was attacked near Laojie at that time. If the Japanese aircraft did not fly through Vietnam, this would never have happened. Gejiu is 20 miles west of Mengzi, so the Japanese aircraft could never have reached Gejiu via Mengzi without being seen. The only explanation is that the Japanese aircraft flew through Vietnam to Gejiu, and then turned east. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the German pilot injured in the Eurasia aircraft shot down by Japanese aircraft in Laojie on April 13 will arrive in Kunming within days. The aircraft only carried one Chinese passenger, who was safe and sound. A rescue aircraft discovered the downed aircraft 80 kilometers from Laojie within Chinese territory, but there was no temporary airfield near the location, so the rescue aircraft could not land and flew to Kunming to report. As for the details of the damage and attack on the aircraft, it will only be known after the German pilot arrives in Kunming. According to Chinese sources, the Eurasia aircraft damaged by Japanese aircraft during the air raid on Kunming on April 8 has been transported to Hong Kong for repairs. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry authorities here announced today that the Japanese authorities in Kyushu had received news that the Chinese government was planning to bomb Japanese territory, and therefore held a large-scale air defense exercise last week. It was also claimed that Japanese aircraft were bombing Chinese air bases everywhere in order to thwart the Chinese plan. It was said that all the aircraft that the Chinese authorities intended to send to attack Japan had been destroyed by Japanese aircraft. As a result, the Kyushu area has cancelled its special alert.

<p>Resistance with a Victorious Spirit</p>
<p>Analyzing China in Growth</p>
<p>Los Angeles Xiao Jishan, deputy head of the overseas branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, came to the United States on official business and is about to go to Washington. He recently made a statement to the local press, saying that a new China is growing in the interior. "The national manpower and material resources have all been moved to the interior. In the past, our country relied on the coastal areas as its economic lifeline, and the infinite resources of the interior, whether mining or agricultural, could not be fully developed. Now we will rely on these resources to deal with Japan. Once China defeats Japan, Germany and Italy's attempt to control the world will also be shattered." After Xiao finishes his official business in Washington, he still needs to travel in the United States for two months before returning to China. (18th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Moscow dispatch, Moscow newspapers recently discussed the situation in China, stating that China possesses all possibilities for achieving final victory. China's manpower is limitless, and its natural resources are sufficient for China to engage in military and economic development in the southwestern provinces. Soviet figures pay close attention to the construction plans in inland provinces such as Sichuan, generally believing that China has received spiritual and financial assistance from abroad during the stage of resisting the aggressors. All peace-loving countries have expressed sympathy toward China, and foreign assistance is sufficient to help China launch its long-term war of resistance against Japan until victory is achieved. Conversely, Japan's burden in the war against China has made the country feel the crisis of ultimate collapse. Until last year, Japan's wartime economy was supported by its reserves, but now those reserves have been depleted. In 1938 alone, Japan's war expenses in China amounted to at least 700 million yen, and military losses were at least 700,000 men. Japan's industry originally relied on foreign exports, so Japan cannot be allowed to engage in a long-term war of aggression on the Asian continent. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Will the Japanese Army Invade Changsha? The Further Their Muddy Feet Reach, the Deeper They Will Sink; A Reckless Western Invasion Will Inevitably Suffer Unprecedented Defeat <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since the Chinese army recently abandoned Nanchang, both domestic and foreign observers have paid close attention to the future war situation, especially regarding the Japanese army's possible attempt to invade Changsha. All parties are greatly concerned about this, and some even believe that if the Japanese army occupies Changsha for even one day, it will be able to control the western provinces of China, thereby seeking resources to reduce its own military burden. Our correspondent recently visited the spokesman of the Military Affairs Commission to inquire about everything. I was honored to have him make the following statement:</p>
<p>On the surface, the enemy's occupation of Nanchang and the cutting off of our Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will make transportation more difficult and will undoubtedly have a considerable impact on the future war situation. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that our army's resolute decision to abandon Nanchang not only has no impact on the future war situation, but may even be</p>
<p>Advantageous to Us</p>
<p>First, from a military perspective, this decision in the Ganbei campaign, after weeks of bloody fighting, was made because our army used its advantages properly, and the officers and soldiers regarded death as home. We have thoroughly completed the task of attrition warfare. The main force of the enemy's Central China Expeditionary Army suffered more than 30,000 casualties, with four dead regimental commanders, many battalion commanders, and many other important officers. Their combat strength has been greatly weakened. The main purpose of our army's combat is to use the mountains to lure the enemy deep. When the majority of the enemy's main force is attracted to a suitable area, the enemy's various mechanized weapons will lose their effectiveness. Then, we can exert our army's advantages and inflict a</p>
<p>Fatal Blow</p>
<p>To make them lose their combat capability. The gain or loss of a city or a place is not important. The enemy made this decision to invade Ganbei, and the sacrifice was so great, which is precisely why. Our army's abandonment of Nanchang and the transfer of its main force to advantageous positions are also necessary measures. In the future, the further the enemy's muddy feet reach, the deeper they will sink. If they further launch a reckless invasion of Changsha, then the degree of their sacrifice will inevitably be even greater, without a doubt. This is one. Second, from a political perspective, since the enemy occupied Wuhan, they have fallen into a trap that we had set in advance. The enemy's manpower, financial resources, and material resources have all reached a point that is not permitted by their national policy. Therefore, after the Wuhan encirclement battle came to an end, the enemy's military actions fell into a state of</p>
<p>Inability to Advance Further</p>
<p>On the one hand, they issued the so-called Konoe Statement, using the guise of peace to lure us into their trap. However, under our national policy of protracted war of resistance, this conspiracy failed to materialize, and their political strategy completely failed. Recently, the enemy's anti-war anger has been raging like wildfire, and the disintegration of domestic morale and the decline of morale at the front have both reached an extreme level. The launch of the Ganbei campaign this time was only intended to divert attention and ease the anti-war psychology of the military and civilians, but unexpectedly, the price paid was so great. Therefore, the morale of the people and soldiers feels even more uneasy, and future battles will be</p>
<p>Increasingly Difficult</p>
<p>If they invade Changsha to the west, the price they pay will naturally be even greater than any number can estimate. This is the second point. Third, from an economic perspective, the enemy has spent more than 100 million yuan in war expenses in this invasion of China, and the total amount of public debt has reached 160 million yuan, most of which is a deficit. It is now estimated that an average of about 14 million yuan is needed per day, and even if they scrape everything clean, they will not be able to do it. Their attempt to plunder resources in China is very active, but in the occupied areas, there are our guerrilla armies, cooperating with the people's armed forces, constantly giving them</p>
<p>Restless Nights</p>
<p>After occupying Nanchang, they turned west to invade Changsha, and even if our Zhejiang-Jiangxi and even Hunan-Jiangxi communications were completely cut off, our center of gravity for foreign transportation is not in the southeast coast. What is imported from the southeast coast is only a part of luxury goods that consume money. In the future, if the road for importing these luxury goods is cut off, in addition to invisibly saving us a lot of people's power and national power, we can concentrate all our efforts on other transportation routes, and the adjustment of the entry and exit of various important materials will actually be</p>
<p>Harmless to Us</p>
<p>The enemy's attempt to plunder our resources is still impossible to achieve, so how can they control our western provinces? Therefore, we know that no matter from a military, political, or economic point of view, the enemy's occupation of Nanchang, and even the invasion of Changsha to the west, only proves their dying struggle. The time of their total collapse must not be far away, and we are fighting to uphold the independence and survival of the country and the nation, and for the universal principles of justice and righteousness. Our manpower, financial resources, and material resources are inexhaustible, so we can fight stronger and stronger, more and more bravely. Final victory must belong to us, and the situation of our enemy after the abandonment of Nanchang is already clear to us. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>(London) The British-Soviet negotiations on an anti-aggression military alliance have taken a sharp turn for the better due to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, returning to the Soviet Union to report. It is said that this extraordinary development is closely related to President Roosevelt's call for peace. This move greatly helped to boost the momentum and courage of the anti-aggression front in Europe, and at the same time, it placed the responsibility for future wars on Hitler and Mussolini. It is generally believed that even if the United States does not help Britain and France with military force, it will definitely sympathize with Britain and France spiritually. Some quarters believe that if a war breaks out, at a certain stage, the United States is very likely to provide military assistance to Britain and France. (United Press dispatch of the 18th)</p>

Well-informed sources here recently announced that it will be difficult for Britain and Turkey to reach an agreement within a few days. Prime Minister Chamberlain will not mention this in his report to the House of Commons today on the international situation, because Turkey is in close contact with the Soviet Union and is afraid that it will have to wait until the British and Soviet negotiations are completed before it is willing to sign an agreement with Britain. What Britain and Turkey are currently discussing is how to amend the Montreux Convention (the convention on the re-fortification of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits) so that the British fleet can freely pass through the two straits to aid Romania when necessary.

<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the British government has not reached any special agreement with the Netherlands, Switzerland, or Denmark in the event that any of these countries is invaded. As for maintaining the independence of various countries, it is beneficial to the British government, which is no need to say much of. Opposition leader Attlee rose to ask the Prime Minister if he could make any remarks on the international situation. The Prime Minister replied that the government has continued to consult closely with other relevant governments, including the Soviet Union. Therefore, in addition to the remarks he made on behalf of the government on April 13 guaranteeing assistance to Greece and Romania to resist aggression, he has not been able to continue to make statements. He wished to take this opportunity to inform the House that the British government expressed great satisfaction with President Roosevelt's recent initiative. When the Prime Minister mentioned the United States, the entire field cheered, and it took a while to stop. A member of parliament asked the Prime Minister if he could announce any new plans aimed at increasing Britain's ability to fulfill its recently expanded responsibilities. The Prime Minister replied that the government is currently engaged in accelerating and expanding the basis of production in order to cope with the increased war potential. In view of recent developments, the government has taken precautions to address the increased needs. The Prime Minister also replied to a question about the supply department, saying that he would express his views on this matter in the near future. Army Minister Bellesha replied to a question about the white rifle, stating that he is currently expanding production and building sufficient manufacturing capacity in Canada. Australia, South Africa, and India have all discussed the establishment of factories to build this gun.

The public believes that Germany is negotiating with Poland for the return of Danzig, the solution of the minority issue, and the issue of granting Germany a passage through the Polish border.

<p>(London) Reuters has learned that almost the entire British Mediterranean Fleet is now concentrated on and near Malta, the British military base in the Mediterranean. Only a few British warships, mostly destroyers, are stationed in Gibraltar, with Rhodes as their base. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British and French governments have taken the necessary measures to prepare for the unexpected, in case Germany and Italy take any action against British Gibraltar or the international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa. This is also to offset the pressure exerted by Germany and Italy on General Franco. This can be seen from the fact that 16 French warships have sailed to Gibraltar to join the British warships in defense. Regarding this matter, well-informed sources here recently declared that if the current status of the Port of Gibraltar is undermined, no matter by which country, Britain and France will consider their vital interests to be threatened. Fortunately, this situation may not materialize, but there is a great concern that Germany and Italy are trying to persuade Spain to sign a military alliance with them to enrich the Anti-Comintern Pact. In addition, France and Spain are conducting negotiations through diplomatic channels.

<p>(Budapest) According to the "Ujság" newspaper's Rome correspondent, Italian political figures attach great importance to the visit of Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Csáky to Rome. It is pointed out that the late Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös's visit to Rome occurred during the Abyssinian War. This time, the Hungarian Prime Minister's visit to Rome is also taking place during a historically significant period for Italy, demonstrating Hungary's firm friendship with Italy. According to the newspaper, the main topics of discussion during the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Rome are the following three: (1) The most important is the Central European issue, including the plan to promote friendship between Italy and Yugoslavia, and seeking a final resolution of relations between Southern Hungary and Hungary; (2) Secondly, the relationship between Hungary and Romania will also be one of the issues discussed, as Italy strongly hopes for an improvement in Hungarian-Romanian relations; (3) Finally, the Hungarian-Italian talks will definitely discuss various issues to promote economic and cultural relations between the two countries.

Foreign Minister Gafencu is only expected to answer that any country is welcome to provide guarantees to Romania. At the same time, he is expected to declare that any proposal that seeks to change the territorial status quo to Romania's disadvantage will be rejected without consideration.

<p>(Washington) The Navy Department's decision to return the fleet to the Pacific this week has led to speculation here that the United States may soon take concrete steps to improve its naval facilities in the Pacific, with particular emphasis on the defense of the southern west coast of the United States. American military strategists have long believed that if the United States wants to fully protect the Panama Canal and resist attacks on the southern west coast of the United States, it must establish a new base south of San Diego. The US Navy's strategy is to repel enemy forces before they reach Hawaii's defenses. However, enemy aircraft may still break through the US border defense line south of Hawaii, making the Panama Canal and the southern west coast of the United States vulnerable to attack. Regarding future developments in this regard, naval officials here declined to comment, but privately expressed the view that the United States is considering purchasing the Galapagos Islands as an air force and submarine base. The "Washington Post" stated that the recall of US ships to the West Coast is a natural result of the development of the European situation and Japan's recent occupation of the New Hebrides Islands. If a European war breaks out, Japan will continue to expand southward. The "Washington Star" stated that the movement of the US fleet "shows the United States' attention to the Pacific and, to some extent, prepares to reduce British and French fears in the Far East." (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, today advocated expanding the navy and air force to defend the United States and prevent unforeseen circumstances. He stated that the country has coastlines on two sides and cannot be adequately defended by a one-ocean navy. At the same time, Walsh called for amending the Neutrality Act to prohibit trade with belligerent countries after the outbreak of war, and proposed that the government should not favor one side or express support or opposition to foreign disputes. Walsh compared the current situation with the situation before the United States entered World War I and warned the Senate, "Today, some people are making shameless and delusional propaganda in a similar form, trying to drag us into the current European dispute, which has nothing to do with us and threatens to cause a second world war." Walsh discussed the United States' defense needs, saying that, for example, the destruction of the Panama Canal would throw the current one-ocean fleet defense system into chaos. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

Pittman had previously expressed the opinion that this clause might be extended and amended. It is now heard from responsible sources that Pittman has slightly delayed his plan to ask Congress to restrict US trade with Japan because Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty.

<p>(Washington) Professor Fenwick of Political Science at Bryn Mawr College today asked participants in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to quickly pass the Thomson resolution, which prohibits continued trade with belligerent countries or countries that violate treaties. According to the professor, "If the United States implements this ban on trade, Japan's war machine could be in trouble within two weeks." Republican Senator White then stated that the "cash transaction" clause of the Thomson resolution "will be detrimental to China because China itself does not have ships to transport goods." But Professor Fenwick replied that China's ability to obtain ships is no different from Norway and Denmark, and that "the impact of current US assistance to Japan on international law and international order is no different from the tyranny of dictators." Fenwick also said that Thomson's resolution "will prevent Germany from invading Poland" and save the outbreak of a European war. Socialist leader Thomson had opposed Pittman's amendment to the Neutrality Act and also argued that the President should not be given greater power when implementing the Neutrality Act. He also said that the United States has been misled by the theory that implementing the Neutrality Act would harm China and has never implemented it. He did not know that this action by the United States has made the United States a collaborator with Japan, since most of the munitions and materials for Japan's war against China are supplied by the United States. But Thomson also does not advocate economic sanctions, because if economic sanctions are implemented, a direct conflict between the United States and Japan will be more likely to occur than a war with Germany, because the Philippines is most vulnerable to attack.

<p>Havas News Agency, New York, March 28 - The "Don't Encourage Japanese Aggression Committee," composed of people from all walks of life in the United States and chaired by former Secretary of State Stimson as honorary chairman, has recently been actively leading public opinion and hoping that the government will stop the people from selling military supplies to Japan, sparing no effort. It even explicitly pointed out that the bombs used by Japanese aircraft when the US gunboat "Panay" was sunk in the upper reaches of Nanjing on December 12, 1937, were made in the United States. The committee's secretary, Price, recently stated that 175,000 members of Christian groups in New York State had submitted a petition to Congressman Fish, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, requesting that Congress pass a law to restrict the shipment of US military supplies to Japan during the Sino-Japanese War.</p>

<p>(Washington) Following President Roosevelt's telegrams to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, newspapers in those countries are filled with opposing views. People here are quite pessimistic as a result. It is learned that the President received detailed reports from Europe on the 8th of this month, advocating urgent action to prevent serious incidents. This was one reason for the President's resolute telegrams. However, some individuals believe that the President's action is clearly a warning to the dictatorial nations and also serves two other purposes: first, to strengthen the allied relationships of countries opposing aggression; and second, to guide domestic public opinion, which has been quite uncertain since the Congressional debates on neutrality laws. After the telegrams were sent, the vast majority of public opinion expressed approval, recognizing this as a powerful move calling for peace, fully in line with the traditional spirit of American presidents intervening to safeguard peace during times of tension. President Roosevelt also pointed out in the telegrams that the world's anxiety should be the responsibility of German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, a point also praised by public opinion. However, although the President said that this action would not cause the United States to assume any responsibility in international politics, some people believe that the President's telegram has already placed the United States in the British and French camp. Therefore, they are extremely concerned about the consequences of this action. In essence, if war does break out, the President must make a firm decision between providing spiritual and material assistance to Britain and France and directly participating in the war. Responsible individuals in the United States say that German leader Hitler has decided to postpone his response until the 28th of this month, clearly intending to use some time to conduct a vigorous propaganda campaign, aiming to diminish the President's prestige in various countries, even in the Americas. The focus of his attacks will be that genuine American public opinion is truly "isolationist," and that the President's actions are aimed at consolidating his personal position in order to be re-elected for a third term in next year's election. However, well-informed sources believe that the President has already seen through his scheme and is prepared to deal with it, and will even disrupt it if necessary. In addition, the State Department announced that the main result of the President's telegrams is that all countries directly or indirectly threatened by the dictatorial nations' desire for control have strengthened their determination to resist. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the State Department last night, the entire Western Hemisphere is now unanimously supporting U.S. President Roosevelt's European peace plan. The State Department has received supportive telegrams from various American countries. Secretary of State Hull is extremely pleased with this, recognizing that American countries share the same feelings about maintaining world peace. Hull stated, "My colleagues and I are extremely delighted by the positive response from the Western Hemisphere and Europe. This clearly shows that all countries recognize the President's action as a practical and necessary contribution to world peace." However, no responses have been received from Germany and Italy so far. It is said that the first to respond to the American President's call for peace were Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Later responses came from Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, and the Prime Minister of Canada also sent a telegram to the U.S. President in response, containing "giving the world another chance to save itself from disaster." The Brazilian President's reply stated, "Your call has gained the support of the people of major countries, making you the sole leader of this continent, and the entire Brazilian nation wholeheartedly supports you."

<p>(London) Hitler must wait until after convening the Reichstag to respond to President Roosevelt's suggestion, but has not yet announced his reasons. According to the German constitution, the Reichstag can be convened in a relatively short period of time. However, British and French newspapers all believe that this delay during a tense period can ensure a few days of calm. Regarding the nature of Hitler's reply, there is currently only extremely vague speculation. The Times stated that to imagine that the Axis powers can lose less in a war than others, or that they face less danger of defeat and collapse, seems to be another fallacy. The British government, like the American government, welcomes negotiations to rebuild genuine peace more sincerely than anything else. If Hitler presents a concrete answer, the British people will wait and test it with this spirit. Now, without waiting for concrete evidence of new security from all sides, which everyone can trust, the determination and preparations for the overall situation cannot be relaxed in the slightest. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding Hitler's decision to postpone his response to Roosevelt's call for two weeks, newspapers here believe that this proves that Hitler recognizes the importance of Roosevelt's declaration. London newspapers speculate that Hitler will propose a counter-proposal in his reply, the content of which requires Southeast Europe and Northeast Europe to be Germany's exclusive sphere of interest, and other countries agree that democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have no right to intervene. The newspapers call this kind of counter-proposal a "non-constructive proposal." (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to general speculation here, the Axis countries' reply to the U.S. President will reject the two major proposals in the telegram: (1) guaranteeing not to attack any country for ten years; and (2) participating in a world conference. Italy's reply will state that Italy seeks nothing but peace, and that Italy's actions in Abyssinia and Albania were caused by situations that endanger world peace. As for the world conference, Italy will make its participation conditional on its demands on France being satisfied. Greater Italy will regard President Roosevelt's telegram calling for peace as a formality and will not offer any response. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) After U.S. President Roosevelt telegraphed German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, leader Hitler is scheduled to convene the Reichstag on the 28th of this month to deliver a speech in response. Diplomatic figures here have recently declared that the success or failure of the negotiations between Britain and France regarding the organization of a collective security system will definitely have a significant impact on the content of leader Hitler's speech. Political figures say that Germany and Italy's reactions to President Roosevelt's telegram were originally different. Italian newspapers initially expressed themselves euphemistically, even expressing approval, but German newspapers firmly expressed opposition. After German Aviation Minister General Göring held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Italian newspapers also leaned towards opposition. However, today's German newspapers' tone has become more moderate, which shows that the German and Italian governments did feel uneasy after receiving the telegram. Hitler must also consider Italy's hesitating attitude. In short, Germany and Italy must decide on a common attitude before the 28th of this month, that is, before leader Hitler delivers his speech. Cabinet members of each country may even hold a meeting to determine the requirements of various policies as preconditions for accepting President Roosevelt's suggestions in the future. In other words, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must clearly explain his wishes for France, and leader Hitler must explain his intentions regarding the problem of the Free City of Danzig and the problem of colonies. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Senator Explains Foreign Policy</p>
<p>(Rome) During today's Senate session, Senator Bevignani delivered a lengthy speech discussing Italy's foreign policy, strongly stating, "Italy will not participate in any international disarmament agreement until all of Italy's legitimate demands are satisfied." The Rome-Berlin Axis is extremely strong, and "no new alliance can encircle Germany and Italy." This axis is aimed at resisting hostile democracies and Bolshevism, and in addition to Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Anti-Comintern Pact has also been signed by "Manchukuo," Hungary, and Spain, and its power is already extremely large. Regarding British-Italian relations, since Britain has recognized the Italian Empire, bilateral relations should be normalized. As for Franco-Italian relations, the agreement previously signed by both sides in 1935 was declared abolished by our government on November 17 of last year. The colonial problems previously explained by Prime Minister Mussolini also concern the problems of Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, which must be resolved quickly. However, the initial response proposed by France was rejected. If this attitude remains stubborn, then the gap between the two sides will definitely not be filled. In conclusion, Italy is determined to have peace, but is also determined to strengthen its national power, so that it is loved by friends and feared by enemies. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Germany Now Has Five Generals</p>

<p>(1) Recognizing the Banate of 4.5 million Croats as an autonomous region of the Croat community, still within the scope of the Yugoslav Constitution. (2) The government party and the Croat Peasant Party jointly form a coalition government.</p>

<p>Knowledge for Couples</p>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<h3 id="e20">Basic Principles of the Way of Couples <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The way of couples is great, only in healthy bodies; when man is strong and woman is beautiful, love will last forever!</p>
<p>When a woman is old enough, she should marry; when a man is old enough, he should marry. For married men and women, the way of couples is indeed closely related to their personal happiness. Even for unmarried men and women, because being a couple is a process they will inevitably go through in the future, there is no one who is not enthusiastically looking forward to it. The way of couples is really too important for personal happiness! In theory, this knowledge, since it is a common need for everyone, should be universally and openly taught in families and in society. However, everyone avoids talking about it deeply. Therefore, young people with strong curiosity and thirst for knowledge often wander on detours and are swallowed up by darkness and misery. Isn't this a cruel and ugly feudal legacy?</p>
<p>The way of couples should be true, good, and beautiful. In other words, it is also scientific, philosophical, and artistic, because it requires the condition of unity of spirit and flesh. The spirit is indeed about the beautification of the spiritual, and the flesh is about scientific physiology. A pair of adult men and women, because of their physiological maturity, develop a kind of instinctive demand. This instinctive demand is based on physical health. Indeed, when an energetic and strong man marries a healthy and beautiful woman, he develops a deep love instinctively because of the mutual comfort he receives. Therefore, in the coordination of love, in the unity of spirit and flesh, they organize a happy family and give birth to clever children. What happiness this is! Under such circumstances, couples will inevitably influence each other and become one. Even if there are slight differences in ambition and habits, they must have already been subtly changed. Or, differences can be used to compensate for each other's shortcomings and be considered valuable. On the other hand, if one party is inherently weak or even loses their ability, such as a man suffering from masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or from reckless indulgence and overwork after marriage, bursting out with spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, thin sperm and infertility, neurasthenia, etc., then no matter how congenial their marriage is, because the couple's life cannot be fulfilled, their love will inevitably fade, or even become like ice and coal, and various tragedies will be staged in the family! Therefore, couples without love are truly evil and hell in this world! A smart husband, if he wants to remedy this, must fundamentally cure his illness. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhis" is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. This agent can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, you will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating. However, if there are nocturnal emissions, you must also take "Himituo's sperm-consolidating tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and stop leakage, which will be more effective.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3 id="e21">Breasts are the Beauty Leaders of Women <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Ugliness starts with weakness. Beauty comes from health!</p>
<p>Busty breasts and big hips: how can they not be loved?</p>
<p>No one wants the word ugly to be attached to themselves. This is especially true for women, because women's love of beauty and competitiveness are stronger than men's. They will not only be angry and hate you to the bone if someone says they are ugly to their face, but even if someone unintentionally says their shortcomings, they will cry behind their backs and feel ashamed and resentful! If someone actually compares them to others in person - especially during a courtship contest and gives them a "cover photo," then they will really be angry and either get angry or commit suicide! Therefore, Dr. Weneiki, a French beauty expert and gynecologist, said that beauty is a woman's second life, which is true. But how to meet the standard of beauty? According to the doctor, a woman's breasts must be two and a half inches high, soft and elastic, and the state must not sag. The nipples must be fully protruding, and the color band should be purplish red for the best. In addition, they must have plump hips and a graceful waist. If they can meet these conditions, they will not only be like a crane in a flock of chickens in social situations, regarded as fertile soil by the opposite sex and enthusiastically pursued, but also be healthy themselves, because of the strong function of the ovaries. Even if they age, they will not age and will still be charming.</p>
<p>However, what should women do who are weakened by disease and have atrophied breasts? According to the doctor and other famous doctors, taking the ovarian preparation female "Shengzhis" is the most effective treatment, because this agent can not only nourish the ovarian function, promote breast development, but also regulate menstruation, eliminate all uterine obstacles, increase pregnancy ability, beautify and strengthen the body. Because of its amazing medicinal power, it is highly praised by people at home and abroad and is praised as the "woman's treasure." Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<h3 id="e22">Common Diseases Caused by Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a common disease among young people. Because it is a common disease, everyone does not regard it as a disease. Therefore, the serious consequences caused by the loss of treatment for nocturnal emission are really countless, and the spread of the root of the disease, which is ever-changing, is also extremely dangerous! Because the semen in the male body after physiological maturity is actually the main endocrine gland that dominates health and longevity. Its function is to promote developmental function, promote vigorous metabolism, and nourish various nerves. If the semen is abundant, the thinking must be rich, the energy must be majestic, and the future will be bright and happy! If you suffer from nocturnal emission due to masturbation, lust, or overwork, and the frequent nocturnal emission causes sperm to dry up and blood to run out, then the developmental function will be prevented, the new metabolism will also be reduced, and the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves will be destroyed. Then all kinds of diseases such as incomplete development, yellow face and thin skin, short stature, small sexual organs, brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, dreams, tinnitus, dizziness, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. Moreover, because of the excessive loss of semen, the semen is thin and lacks sperm, causing infertility. If the youth is like this, not only will he be dying and unable to study and work, but also in the minimum couple life in life, love will be weak and like ice and coal, and there will be no children, causing lifelong regrets!</p>
<p>If you want to remedy this, at this time, you can only take "Himituo's sperm-consolidating tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and calm the nerves, and nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhis" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you can continue to take it, you will definitely be able to fundamentally cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also achieve the effect of prolonging life. If the patient can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and then use electrotherapy, injection, surgery and other targeted therapies, cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Radical Treatment Method for Turning into Chronic Gonorrhea <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Symptoms of Chronic Leukorrhea</p>
<p>There are many characteristics of chronic leukorrhea, and the reduction of pain is also one of them. Other changes increase daily, the poison gas spreads, the disease becomes deeper, and the later the treatment, the more difficult it is. Without a smart and insightful doctor, using the most scientific methods for treatment, it is rare to achieve full success. The number of patients with chronic gonorrhea is increasing, so if a doctor tells a gonorrhea patient that it has turned into chronic, it is like a prisoner hearing a life sentence. This is actually a misunderstanding. Probably the leukorrhea from acute to chronic must be due to the failure to thoroughly cure the acute gonorrhea. Often in the two or three weeks after infection, the treatment is lost or mistreated, the pain gradually decreases, the pus gradually decreases, the urine also changes from turbid to clear, and all the symptoms of acute gonorrhea gradually disappear. In terms of pain relief, it is certainly a temporary physical pleasure for gonorrhea patients, but the internal hidden dangers are very deep.</p>
<p>New Guidelines for Radical Cure</p>
<p>Changing from unbearable pain and practically late to cure acute gonorrhea to stubborn gonorrhea, one must adopt a new method of targeted treatment, and the primary conditions are three. One is to kill bacteria, the second is to filter poison, and the third is to correct the pathological state. The only ideal therapy that meets these guidelines is to use German Lymph-Filtering Galvanic Therapy and inject German Xi's Serum and Quick Sensitivity Surgery to quickly and radically cure it. All chronic gonorrhea prostatitis, cystitis, arthritis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, and urethral stricture can be completely cured within a limited time, and because Lymph-Filtering Galvanic Therapy can filter out gonorrhea toxins, it is especially effective for neuralgia caused by gonorrhea toxins.</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Disordered Scene in Guangzhou Under Japanese Military Control: Chinese Air Force Advises Citizens to Evacuate; Bandits Assemble to Kill Japanese Patrol Soldiers; Guerrilla Forces, Numerous and Well-Equipped, Infiltrate the City <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Regarding the Anglo-Japanese agreement on navigation on the Pearl River, stipulating that a ship should leave the port every two weeks, the "Jinshan" was to sail to Guangzhou once. Recently, the Hong Kong side, in accordance with the agreement, dispatched the "Foshan" to replace the "Jinshan" to the province. After arriving in the province, it still docked at the Taikoo Dockyard bridge, stayed for two days, and returned to Hong Kong. A total of over 1,100 people arrived. Westerners accounted for very few. Whether it was 12-yuan, 8-yuan, or 5-yuan seats, all were fully booked, and the situation was extremely crowded. Here is what passengers reported regarding the recent situation in Guangzhou:</p>
<p>Chinese Air Force Repeatedly Destroys Japanese Airfields</p>
<p>The XX squadrons of the new Chinese Air Force recently received orders to assist the Fourth War Zone's counter-offensive forces in annihilating the enemy. They have repeatedly appeared over the city of Guangzhou. When they arrive, it is often at the crack of dawn. Citizens are often awakened from their dreams by the sound of bombs and anti-aircraft guns. They have destroyed quite a number of military installations operated by the Japanese army in the suburbs of the city. The most effective were the 24th and 25th of last month. It was found that on the morning of the 24th, ten Chinese Air Force planes suddenly flew in. The Japanese army, in a panic, had no time to issue an alarm and immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, extremely flustered. However, the Chinese Air Force soared freely and selected targets, using the most agile methods to descend rapidly from a height of 10,000 feet, continuously dropping more than 20 heavy bombs on the Baiyun and Tianhe airfields. The sound of the explosions shook the entire city. Although the Japanese anti-aircraft guns installed at Shougou Ridge, Baiyun Mountain, and Niulan Hill fired as densely as a string of pearls, they could not threaten the Chinese Air Force. Subsequently, Japanese planes flew in from the Humen direction, attempting to intercept the Chinese Air Force, but the Chinese Air Force had already completed its mission and broke through the encirclement to retreat. In this battle, six or seven Japanese planes at the Baiyun and Tianhe airfields were destroyed. On the 25th, a Chinese Air Force squadron arrived at Humen, bombed the Shijiao Fort, and then flew to the Bai Sha area, dropping six heavy bombs on the small airfield operated by the Japanese army there. The airfield has already been completely destroyed. In addition to bombing Japanese military installations, the Chinese Air Force also distributed leaflets, stating that the various armies were about to launch a major counter-offensive, urging residents in the city to leave the city as soon as possible to avoid complete destruction. The Japanese strictly forbade citizens from picking up these leaflets, and those who violated the order were beaten. However, many leaflets have been read by residents, who inform each other to disguise themselves and leave the city, so the situation is more chaotic than before, and people are panic-stricken, unable to sleep or eat.</p>
<p>Japanese Wounded Soldiers Are Continuously Returned to Guangzhou</p>
<p>After the Japanese army invaded Ronggui and Shunde, fierce battles took place everywhere. The Guangzhou Japanese army hospital corps is exceptionally busy. Electric boats on the Pearl River are frequently moving to transport military supplies, and wounded Japanese officers and soldiers are continuously transported back to Guangzhou from the war zone. The number of casualties is likely not small. Moreover, the Japanese army orders a curfew every day. The curfew area extends from the Tianzi Wharf on the South Bank to the Hanmin Road area, where Japanese soldiers are stationed, prohibiting pedestrians from passing through. The situation is extremely serious, as it is transporting wounded soldiers back to the province from the war zone. Each time the wounded are transported to the province, there are more than a thousand people. Among them, on the 30th of last month, several thousand wounded soldiers were transported back to the province from the West River in dozens of civilian boats, including two senior officers who were also seriously injured, which shows the seriousness of the casualties.</p>
<p>Bandits Are Ferocious and Run Rampant in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>The situation in Guangzhou is even more chaotic than before. Currently, merchants are enduring the pain of resuming business under the threat of the Japanese army, but banditry is rampant in the city, and many shops are being looted. Initially, this was mostly done at night, but recently it has become increasingly violent, running rampant in broad daylight, treating Japanese military police as if they were nothing. In a certain street in western Guangzhou, dozens of bandits seized the ends of the street and carried out a large-scale looting. A Japanese soldier happened to be patrolling and was captured and beheaded by the bandits, who hung his head high on a utility pole before calmly leaving. Merchants are unable to withstand the looting due to the loss of capital, so most have closed down. According to statistics, the number of shops in the city recently has decreased by as much as five-tenths compared to the previous month. Those that have not closed are mostly engaged in multiple businesses. Some funeral shops also sell firewood and rice, and some butcher shops also sell vegetables. The order is extremely chaotic, much like a small market in a remote rural area. Moreover, the rampant bandits are not only targeting shops and residents, but also Japanese people. Foreigners on Shamian are also often patronized. The purpose of the robbery is regardless of the amount. Even those who have two or three cents to enjoy tea in a tea house are robbed. Therefore, residents dare not go out even during the day to avoid being robbed. As a result, the streets, except for two or three main roads, have almost no pedestrians. Even during the day, it is like a ghost market. Recently, Chinese guerrillas have spread inside and outside the city, and the Japanese cannot cope. According to reliable sources, the number of guerrillas lurking from the city to the suburbs is truly astonishing, estimated to be no less than 50,000. The components, in addition to the strong men from the suburbs and the villages of Nanhai and Panyu, also include many who were dispatched or voluntarily joined from Zhongshan, Shunde, Dongguan, Zengcheng, Conghua, and other counties to Guangzhou, engaging in secret work and attacking the Japanese army when the opportunity arises. The attack on the Zhengjin Bank last month was a manifestation of the coordinated actions of the guerrillas from various counties in Guangzhou. Moreover, the guns are new and the ammunition is sufficient. Each launch makes it impossible for the scattered Japanese troops to resist. They are implementing the rear of the Japanese as the front. They do not launch lightly in peacetime. Each launch must have a major purpose and will not stop until it is achieved. The people's armed forces are growing under Japanese forces. The organization is becoming larger day by day and is an indelible fact.</p>
<p>A Small Number of Shops Are Forced to Resume Business</p>
<p>Currently, the Guangzhou restaurants that have resumed business include Dasanyuan, Jinlong, Qimiaozhai (formerly known as Yuanyuan), Jinlun, and other agile shops. They have all resumed business because they were forced by the Japanese army, otherwise, they would be confiscated by the Japanese army and operated on their own. However, there are some unscrupulous merchants who have opened a "Greater China Cuisine" and made wild remarks, promoting welcome to the "Imperial Army." Inside, they hire Japanese women as hostesses. The guerrillas recently warned the investors of the restaurant, and the restaurant asked the Japanese headquarters for protection. The Japanese instructed the puppet police to send plainclothes detectives to investigate. The restaurant is even more panicked, knowing that these secret agents are all bandits, providing insufficient protection and more disturbance.</p>
<p>Planned Household Registration Check Is Too Risky to Proceed</p>
<p>The Japanese army is extremely anxious about the lurking growth of the guerrillas. They have consulted with the puppet organization to check household registration, but they feel that the number of Japanese troops and puppet organizations is not large enough to conduct a large-scale check at the same time. Furthermore, they are worried that the guerrillas will preemptively strike. The Japanese are also making great efforts to attract people from all over to return to the city, using "living and working in peace" as a slogan. They are also afraid that checking household registration will cause unrest in the city, which will make the people even more reluctant to return. All of these are concerns that the Japanese army cannot solve, so the Guangzhou Japanese army often has difficulty sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>Citizens Leaving the City Are Severely Abused</p>
<p>Citizens who took the ship to Hong Kong this time were subjected to harsh abuse by the Japanese when leaving the city. In addition to paying a large sum to the Japanese army headquarters to obtain an exit permit, they also had to go through various inspections. Any slight hesitation would result in the refusal to issue a permit. When boarding the ship, a large team of Japanese soldiers was stationed on the pier to search. Anyone who was not careful would be humiliated. Even Westerners were not spared. A Westerner on the same ship was stopped by the Japanese army when boarding the ship from the suspension bridge. The Westerner questioned them slightly, but the Japanese army ignored him and beat him with fists and feet. The Westerner could do nothing. In short, present-day Guangzhou has been occupied by bandits and Japanese people. Residents who remain are like fish on a chopping board, at the mercy of others. There is nothing more painful than this.</p>
<h3 id="e25">The 9th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous Army Is Changed to a Self-Defense Corps; The Troops Desert Twice; The Commander's Will Is Passive <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>According to someone from Qingpu County, Chen, the commander of the 9th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, was forced by the 45th Brigade last fall to withdraw from Dianfeng Town and was ordered by the Central Government to be transferred to the Taihu Lake area of Wujiang. At that time, he led his troops across the Sujia Road to Taiping Bridge, where he had a fierce battle with the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese army suffered 50 or 60 casualties, and three cars were destroyed. After crossing the Sujia Road to Hengshan Town in Wujiang, the town was defended by the 7th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. Because the two sides had the same position, they established close contact and distributed the major detachments to garrison in the Taihu Lake area. About two months later, Cheng Wanjun, the commander of the 7th Detachment, had secretly been bought by the Japanese and actually surrounded the 9th Detachment, forcing them to surrender to the Japanese army. The officers and soldiers of the detachment all resisted and, in order to preserve their strength, still rushed back to the Sujia Road and ordered Zhou's troops, the most powerful in the detachment, to send Staff Officer Yang to lead the radio station and lead Commander Zhou's troops back to the original defense. Chen, the detachment commander, also took the opportunity to lead the entire team of 700 or 800 people to follow. However, Staff Officer Yang and radio station Guo, and Commander Zhou, had a new intention to rebel, intending to change the designation to the New 9th Detachment, forming an irreconcilable conflict with Chen. However, most of the lower-level officers and soldiers sneaked back with their guns to listen to Chen's orders. When Yang knew that the situation was not good, he fled with his family. Zhou Guo and others had no choice but to return to the team. At that time, Chen was lenient with them and did not hold it against them. However, Zhou secretly contacted the 735th Regiment, a stranded unit of the 45th Brigade, and sent the entire second squadron of his troops to the regiment. Subsequently, he led all of his troops and the radio station to leave. After Chen learned of this, he led all of his troops to pursue them, advancing to the mouth of the Miaohu River. The two sides came into contact. Zhou, with few against the many, was intercepted by Chen's radio station, and about 30 or 40 of Zhou's troops were shot. Guo, the radio station operator, was also killed. However, at this moment, three Japanese warships suddenly arrived and attacked fiercely from the middle. Zhou then led 70 or 80 people and took the opportunity to escape. Chen's troops also retreated to their original defenses with a passive attitude, intending to disband their troops. After repeated persuasion from the gentry of Dianfeng Town, who pointed out that if Chen's troops were disbanded, the locality would suffer, it was agreed to change Chen's troops to a self-defense corps to protect the area and reassure the people. All supplies and salaries would be the responsibility of the District Chief Hu. Chen's troops participated in the anti-war effort, and this matter came to an end.</p>

<p>Pi County, Northern Jiangsu, fell on February 12 after being heavily pressed by the Japanese army. On the 23rd, the county police and the regular army climbed into the city by ladders, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers, capturing five alive, seizing 11 long and short guns, one machine gun, and three warhorses. The Japanese army then broke through the gate and fled. On the 26th, the Japanese army again assembled mechanized troops to counterattack Pi City. In order to avoid large-scale casualties, the Chinese army safely withdrew from the county seat. Then, County Magistrate Wang Huayun joined forces with the self-defense forces of various districts to counterattack Pi County again. The fierce battle was quite intense. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it and abandoned the city and fled. Thus, the county seat was recovered by the Chinese army for the second time. However, when the Japanese army retreated, they set fire to the county government and the houses of various agencies. After the Chinese army entered the city, they extinguished the fires separately. The Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Guanhuzhen and firmly defended the railway line. County Magistrate Wang led his troops to continuously attack, and there were fierce battles from time to time. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in recognition of the county seat's recovery twice, sent a telegram to County Magistrate Wang on the 8th of this month, commending him and rewarding the troops with 1,000 yuan to show encouragement.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education Actively Promotes Compulsory Education, Increasing One Million Yuan in the 28th Year <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has spared no effort in wartime educational facilities in recent years, especially focusing on the promotion of compulsory education. It is aware of the difficulty of providing education to those who have dropped out of school due to the war. Although it has tried to arrange for them, it has still failed to provide universal relief. It plans to add many council schools in various counties throughout the province this year to accommodate them. It is now known that the provincial education budget for the 28th year has already begun to be compiled. It is heard that the decision has been made to increase the funds for compulsory education by another 500,000 yuan, and the funds for social education are also planned to be increased by 500,000 yuan, for a total increase of 1 million yuan. Once the budget is compiled and sent to the provincial government for review and approval by the Ministry of Education, it can be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Full Text of the Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (XI): Proposal for the Improvement of Elementary Education (Special Correspondent Yi Sheng from Chongqing) <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The elementary education improvement proposal passed by the Third National Education Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting compulsory education and improving elementary school education are fundamental plans for war construction and national construction. This proposal advocates, on the one hand, extending the length of short-term elementary schools and improving their teaching methods to improve their level, and at the same time completing the basic institutions for promoting compulsory education in various localities, so as to expand in terms of quantity. On the other hand, establishing an elementary school guidance and research system and formulating various facility standards will improve in terms of quality. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Regarding the Division of Compulsory Education</p>
<p>1. Extend the length of short-term elementary school studies and "find ways to improve their level": (1) The one-year short-term elementary schools established by various localities for the promotion of compulsory education should gradually extend their length of study to two-year short-term elementary schools or junior elementary schools according to local needs and capabilities. (2) Two-year short-term elementary schools should try to use effective educational methods to improve their level and find ways to connect their curriculum with the curriculum of elementary schools at all levels.</p>
<p>2. Complete the grassroots institutions for establishing elementary schools in various localities: Each province, city, and county should complete the establishment of the grassroots institutions for elementary schools in the 28th year in accordance with the "Measures for the Division of Elementary School Districts in Cities and Counties" promulgated by the Ministry of Education. However, if a province, city, or county has special circumstances, it may formulate another method applicable to the locality and submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. (1) Each county and city should, in a short period of time, delineate elementary school districts, with one bao to several bao, or one street or one village, with a population of about 1,000 people, as an elementary school district, as the most grassroots institution for establishing a two-year short-term elementary school. (2) Each county and city should also delineate one lianbao to several lianbao, or one township (town) to several townships, with ten to twenty elementary school districts, as a joint elementary school district, and establish a four-year junior elementary school in each district, as the central elementary school for the short-term elementary schools in each elementary school district. (3) Each county and city should also delineate ten joint elementary school districts (i.e., autonomous regions) as a county school district. Establish a six-year elementary school in each county school district, as the central elementary school for the four-year elementary schools in the joint elementary school districts. (4) If each province has grounds to create a grassroots institution for establishing elementary schools that is suitable for the local province based on the above principles and the actual situation of the province, the Ministry of Education may approve a flexible approach, but it must first be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval before implementation. (5) Except for the war zone provinces, which may postpone the delineation and establishment of grassroots institutions such as elementary school districts, the rear provinces must all complete them in the 28th year.</p>
<p>3. Improve the organization of compulsory education committees at all levels: (1) Compulsory education committees at all levels should strengthen their organization so that they can effectively assume the technical aspects of supervision, editing, research, experimentation, investigation, and publicity. (2) Compulsory education committees at all levels should fully strengthen the organization of the supervision and management of funds, so as to effectively exercise their powers and attach importance to compulsory education funds.</p>
<p>4. Train compulsory education teachers and compulsory education administrative personnel: (1) The training of compulsory education teachers in each province and city in the future should be based on the training of normal schools and simplified normal school departments. (2) When there is a shortage of compulsory education teachers in each province and city, graduates of junior high schools or above and those with equivalent academic qualifications may be recruited and trained as substitute teachers. (3) Each province, county, and city should stipulate further education measures for short-term elementary school teachers and supervise their implementation. (4) The treatment of short-term elementary school teachers should be properly standardized according to local living conditions so that they can serve with peace of mind. (5) Short-term elementary school substitute teachers with excellent results may be changed to formal teachers with the approval of the competent education administrative agency. (6) Each province should convene training courses or discussion meetings for administrative personnel in charge of compulsory education in various counties and cities from time to time.</p>
<p>5. Raise compulsory education funds: (1) The central compulsory education subsidy should still be expanded year by year according to the original plan and fully disbursed on schedule, and should not be used for other purposes. (2) The amount of compulsory education funds allocated by each province and city should be increased year by year at least in proportion to the central subsidy amount and included in the budget, fully disbursed on schedule, and not be used for other purposes. (3) Each province, city, and county may consider the following methods of raising funds according to local conditions: A. After the financial revenue and expenditure system is implemented, each province, city, and county should prescribe a percentage of the local tax revenue to be allocated to compulsory education funds according to the needs of compulsory education. B. Each county and city should use effective methods to reorganize the educational property and other public property to increase revenue and allocate it to compulsory education funds. C. Each county and city should designate tax revenue to ensure compulsory education funds. D. Short-term elementary school expenses may be shared by the local people according to their wealth. (4) Elementary school buildings should be used as much as possible from the original local public property and built with donations from the local people. (5) Elementary school equipment may be encouraged to be donated by local people.</p>
<p>(II) Regarding Kindergartens and Elementary Education</p>
<p>1. Stipulate the principles of establishment; 2. Improve the administrative institutions in charge of elementary education at all levels and determine the work of research and guidance; 3. Formulate various standards for kindergartens and elementary schools, such as teaching buildings, moral education, hygiene, and equipment. (1) Revise the curriculum standards for kindergartens and elementary schools and compile an outline of teaching materials; (2) Formulate standards for elementary school vocabulary and grammar, and various teaching materials for the card literacy teaching method; (3) Review and select a catalog of various reading materials suitable for children and issue them to elementary schools at all levels for adoption; (4) Compile standard tests and methods for examining the results of various subjects; (5) Revise the standards for elementary school civic training and the standards for elementary school hygiene facilities and equipment; (6) Formulate standards for kindergarten and elementary school buildings and other equipment; (7) Formulate measures for social facilities to assist children's education; (8) Compile and review wartime teaching materials and supplementary reading materials for elementary schools.</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot market for gold bars showed a narrow range of fluctuation, with a difference of only five yuan throughout the day. The situation shifted from weak to tight. Although a certain silver shop initially purchased on behalf of Hong Kong banks, the cash firms frequently sold, so the underlying trend was slightly weak. Later, Tianjin and Xiamen banks suddenly followed the Hong Kong banks in purchasing, which led to a tighter and steadier market. The price rose to a high of 2,080 yuan at the close of the day, resulting in a gain of three yuan. Due to local banks' wait-and-see attitude, trading was unusually light, with only 450 taels traded. Silver jewelry remained unchanged, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rose slightly.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market situation for securities was that the market suddenly rebounded in the morning due to rumors, but the sellers were all floating profits, and the big players were mostly absorbing at low prices. However, the short sellers, due to the severe pressure, were thinking of selling again, intending to create a terror situation, such as Runli's brave selling, but the long side was extremely stable, because the rumors were absolutely inaccurate. Therefore, the rebound suddenly rose in the afternoon. This trend is favorable to the long side, because once setbacks, and then returned to high, the trend is more firm. Yesterday's experience was that the market was initially firm, and then Runli and No. 5 sold the most, and Hongda, Lianhe, Yuankang and other numbers successively sold, thinking that the rumors could be speculated. Who knows that the big players absorbed at low prices, and the stomach was extremely healthy. Dafeng bought the most, and Tongsheng, Tongkang, Zhenkang, and Hengfu all bought. The morning result was still pressured by Runli by a small number of corners to a yuan. After a thousand, the seller was scarce, only No. 2, No. 5 and No. 70 slightly supplied. Yongkang, Yongfeng, Defu, and Fuchun all bought. The rumors stopped suddenly, and the retail short sellers were still stubbornly resisting. The afternoon result has returned to three or four corners.

Ninety-six is still very firm, and the total number of transactions is estimated to be around 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>

<p>Public business office, the stock market is unusually heavy, and more changes are also quite falling.

<p>Yesterday's international silk market fluctuated slightly. In Lyon, white silk prices rose 5.5 francs, Shanghai silk A-grade rose 4.5 francs, and B-grade rose 3 francs, making it the firmest market. Yokohama silk spot prices rose 8 yuan, and forward prices fell 11 yuan, indicating a discrepancy between near and far terms. New York's Chinese and Japanese raw silk were sold at the original prices, and the Reuters wire for near futures was 2.26 yuan, down 9 cents from the previous day. This may be a telegraphic error, as the current silk market does not seem to be in danger of a sharp drop. Let's see what happens today. New York's distant futures are down only half a point, so they are still stable. According to the recent situation in the international silk market, it can be described as steady and progressive, so it is predicted that silk prices still have the potential to rise further. This point can be confirmed by the prosperous sales of silk by foreign firms in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Since the recent rise in silk prices, the Shanghai silk market has adopted a prudent attitude due to the past operational errors, resulting in a slow rise in Shanghai silk prices. Therefore, it is close to the foreign firms, and foreign sales have been developing day by day for the past four or five days. Silk prices have been rising by 10 yuan per day, and this normal development has led to the grand transactions yesterday. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Dachan, Liana, and others all made progress. White factory 7-8 points 20-22 striped, the price of 1,700 yuan, a total of 300 loads, can be described as extremely prosperous. Silk prices rose only 10 yuan compared to the previous day. At present, both domestic and foreign silk markets undoubtedly have the potential to rise further, but one point seems to be worth noting, that is, the general public is now overly optimistic, thinking that the current Japanese and American silk prices have already exceeded the previous high records, and only the Shanghai silk market, although silk transactions are now booming, is still far from the previous record of 1,950 yuan. This mentality may cause a recurrence of the previous mistakes, but a review of the previous soaring facts can reveal the unreasonableness of this argument. In the middle of the previous month, when Shanghai user silk prices were sold at 1,950 yuan, it was the day when the white factory B-grade 7-8 points issued an external telegraph price of 1,715 yuan, with no response. Therefore, the previous high price record in Shanghai cannot be compared with today's export silk prices, which is undoubtedly questionable. In short, observing the current development of silk prices, it is considered that there is still a potential for temporary rise, but it is not easy to expect the recurrence of 1,950 yuan. This point, the recent silence of the user silk market, and the fact that the eating price is about 50 yuan lower than that of the foreign firms, can also be used to get a glimpse of the general trend of silk prices in the future. Also, yesterday 50 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Yarn and Cotton: The Rapid Rise in Price Led to a Halt in Export Sales - 20-Count Double Horse Yarn Fell Back by 2 Yuan - Sales in Japanese Yarn Guerrilla Areas Also Decreased <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The wildly soaring yarn market of the previous day showed a slight leveling off yesterday. At the same time, the number of customers bringing their own paths was not as large as yesterday, and the popularity was not as hot as in the past. In fact, it has risen from the low price before the Spring Festival closure by 36, 7 yuan to 40 yuan. Thinking about the problem of cotton yarn itself, it can be temporarily concluded. However, according to the discussion of a part of the current merchants, the future is still rising, saying that one is that this time they have seen the low price rise, supported by the actual needs of South China, and the second is that the inland transport line, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi road was interrupted late, and it has been changed to be transported from Shantou inland. Yarn sales are becoming more and more prosperous, and the inventory has been emptied a lot, so the amount of absorption is still not willing to give up easily. Therefore, yesterday's trend mostly presented a situation of big rise and small return, and the fundamental key is still thinking about the actual position.</p>
<p>The situation of the current yarn, the morning opening, continued to rise on the surplus of the previous day, the opening price increased by one yuan, the price of 20-count Double Horse was 404 yuan, and the stack price was 398 yuan and a half. However, the customer's sales stomach was stagnant and unmoved due to the crazy rise in the previous day. As for the general floating households, in view of the current yarn turning stagnant, the intention of selling off is more and more sluggish, and the market suddenly saw a weak, step by step falling back, Double Horse was done to 400 yuan, and the stack price was 396 yuan. By the time of closing, the long-term players and others came to cheapen the goods, and then recovered by one yuan, to 401 yuan and a half, but most of the transactions were between the same firms. As a result, the total amount of clouds bought by the various firms throughout the day was 1,852 packages, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse brand and the big daughter brand fell by one and a half to two yuan compared with the previous day. The remaining 32-count and 42-count still rose by 23 yuan and so on. Zhenhua Factory opened 40 yuan, and Li Tai Factory opened 145 packages of 20-count Xing Lion, the price was 377 yuan. Yesterday, 750 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount of cloud bought by each firm is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market situation turned weak, because the quality needs were more sluggish, because the consumption in the guerrilla area was reduced, but the hearts of the local people were still stalwart, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month was 359 yuan, and there was not much up and down with the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e54">National Cotton Supply Cut Off; Flower Firms to Change to Bulk Buying, Purchasing Large Quantities of "Ping Nie Er" to Fill Demand for "Huoji" Cotton <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Foreign cotton prices, especially in the New York cotton market, have been falling for several days. Industry insiders are closely watching for news from Washington regarding cotton loans, but no announcement has been made, causing deep concern about the release of cotton and the non-execution of export subsidies, all due to the government's many difficulties. Yesterday, there were suspicions that the government's cotton industry plan might have been slightly altered. With the May delivery period in New York approaching and the Liverpool cotton market being unusually firm, many old short positions were heavily covered. May delivery rose by four British pounds, Indian cotton (including predictions) rose by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by over ten British pounds, all reflecting an increase in legal tender cotton prices. American and Brazilian cotton each rose by 80 cents per picul, Indian cotton by 70 cents, and Egyptian cotton by over 60 cents.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, foreign cotton trading firms are shifting to bulk buying due to the cutoff of national cotton supplies. They have been placing large orders for Indian "Xiao Guo Er" cotton, which has fibers similar to "Huoji," but with a lower color grade. These firms plan to use this cotton as a substitute for "Huoji" cotton after it arrives. Yesterday, foreign cotton trading at various factories was particularly quiet. The converted factory prices for foreign cotton yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>The local cotton business, which had been picking up, faced a deadlock as prices rose and supplies were cut off. Chinese and foreign factories have mostly switched to Indian and British cotton as replacements. No goods are arriving from Northern Jiangsu because several ports are affected by guerrilla warfare, and ships have temporarily suspended operations, leading to no supply. Only one transaction of 200 bales of spot cotton was completed among industry peers yesterday, with "Huoji" cotton priced at 70.05 yuan, cash on delivery. No other transactions were reported.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Dried Goods: "Yuan Zhi" Lacking, Sudden Rise of 3 Yuan <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>"Jinshan Zhi" is experiencing a sudden tightening of the market due to scarce arrivals. Yesterday, stores in the Southern District opened with over sixty cases of "Yuan Zhi," with demand exceeding supply, causing a price increase of two to three yuan. High-grade rose to 64 yuan, while secondary grades ranged from 63.30 yuan to 60.40 yuan, with wholesale prices also increasing accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Grains: Local Flour Still Mostly Sold to the North, Foreign Flour Prices Soar Amidst European Tensions <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Local flour mills reported stable conditions for their current flour inventories. After raising factory prices by five cents the previous day, trade with local customers was not sluggish due to the higher prices. Mill officials indicated a continued intention to raise prices due to recent dangerous international developments and firm foreign market prices. However, foreign flour prices have stabilized after the increase, and some goods are being returned to the market, making it difficult for the market to improve significantly in the short term. As a result, wholesale prices remained firm at 4.45 yuan. Retail sales of 40,000 to 50,000 bags were reported, including batches of No. 4 flour and No. 5 white bag flour, priced at 4.20 yuan and 3.80 yuan, respectively. Sales remained primarily to Northern merchants, followed by Southern merchants and local vendors. Exports of flour totaled 52,000 bags to Tianjin and 4,500 bags to Yantai yesterday.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour</p>
<p>Foreign flour trading continued to be quiet yesterday. Arrivals of American and Australian flour have been limited in recent days. Amidst the dangerous situation in Europe, the prospects for foreign flour and wheat are promising. Therefore, those holding foreign flour in the market are reluctant to sell it easily, while buyers are not urgently in need, leading to a stalemate. As a result, transactions are sporadic, with the general price remaining at 4.20 yuan in cash. High-end brands increased by 5 to 10 cents. Transactions of over 10,000 bags were reported.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Foreign and Local "Xian" Rice Prices Decline <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Although whole batches of "Ke Xian" rice have been arriving recently, sporadic supplies have not been cut off. Over 2,000 bags of various "Xian" rice from Anhui arrived in the market yesterday, but sales remained limited to local vendors. Yesterday's transactions totaled over 1,000 bags. High-quality rice maintained its original price, while medium and lower-quality rice fell by 5 to 10 cents. Nanjing high-grade "Xian" rice was priced at 13 yuan, while ordinary rice was only 12.30 to 12.40 yuan. High-grade "Wu Xian" rice was 12.80 to 12.90 yuan, "Guan Guan" rice was around 12 yuan, and "Yi Xian" rice was only 11.60 to 11.70 yuan. Saigon rice also fell slightly by 5 cents, with ordinary rice selling for only 17.20 yuan. High-quality old rice was still selling for 17.40 to 17.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Local Rice Prices Remain Stable Despite Sufficient Inventory <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>After the ban on transporting rice from Changshu and Wuxi areas from January 15th onward, these areas have been completely cut off, except for Changzhou, which sees one or two trucks arriving per day. Rice prices have remained unchanged during this period, with only small amounts of early and late rice from Southern Jiangsu and areas around Nantong arriving in Shanghai. This situation has a significant impact on the food supply in Shanghai and should be addressed. However, the market in Shanghai has seen fluctuations of only 10 to 20 cents in recent months, thanks to the ample inventory. According to reports from the Price Stabilization Association, there are still over 600,000 bags in stock. Moreover, consumers, except for wholesalers, are mostly small-scale buyers, followed by retailers, so demand is not high. At the same time, speculators are less active due to the lack of price changes. Therefore, although only twelve trucks of river-bottom rice and a little over 2,000 bags of "Sutong" rice arrived yesterday, the market remains stable. Prices for thick and thin "Jing" rice, as well as "Du Yang Jian," "Bu Jian," and "Bian Yuan" rice, have seen little change.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Soar to Unprecedented Levels in Sixty Years; Raw Oil at 1.2 Yuan per Jin, Also an All-Time High <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The upward trend in soybean oil prices shows no sign of stopping. The highest recorded price for soybean oil in Dalian reached 45 yuan per barrel, while bleached soybean oil reached 47.5 yuan. "Lianqi" small barrel oil rose by 1.9 yuan, a shocking increase unseen in the last sixty years. Yesterday, over 300 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at prices ranging from 44.30 yuan to 45 yuan. 30 barrels of bleached soybean oil were traded at 47.5 yuan. 100 pieces of "Lianqi" small barrel oil traded at 43.4 yuan, 150 pieces of large barrel oil traded at 42.3 yuan, and 200 pieces of "Yantaiqi" oil traded at 34 yuan. 100 "dan" of "Dayou" factory oil traded at prices ranging from 34.80 to 35 yuan. Peanut oil prices were slightly stable, with 20 pieces of "Jiaozhou" oil trading at the original price of 39 yuan, 30 pieces of land-transported oil trading at 38.5 yuan, and 10 pieces of "Yantai" oil trading at 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Retail prices for raw oil are 1.2 yuan for 2.6 "jin", and soybean oil is 1.2 yuan for 2.12 "jin", but prices may increase further today. This is due to manipulation by Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Miscellaneous Grains: April Soybean Futures Temporarily Exempted by 30% <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Dalian soybeans, April futures are temporarily exempted by 30% according to Japanese merchants, but the relaxation is limited to the period of control, and the original contract must still be fulfilled after the ban is lifted.  Also, the buyer will bear the increased export fees from Dalian, resulting in endless disputes. Currently, most of the market is empty buying and selling, and they are constantly making up for each other, so there have been few major changes in the market recently.  There were quite a few transactions yesterday, with about twelve or three trucks traded, priced at 8.70 to 8.80 yuan. However, as spot soybeans are still subject to contract deliveries after the ban is lifted (there is hope for lifting the ban), floating profits are quickly appearing, and prices have fallen from 9 yuan to 8.80 yuan, a further drop of 35 cents from the previous day. More than a dozen trucks were traded, and other beans were unaffected. More than 300 bags of Chongming "Sha Huang" were priced at 9 to 9.2 yuan, and 50 bags of Pudong "Du Dou" were priced at 9.95 yuan.</p>

<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>White fine cloth, fine twill, with various cloth factories already accepting huge orders for printed, dyed, and flannelette grey cloth, the future production volume will inevitably be greatly reduced, so the selling price is becoming increasingly tight. Over one hundred bags of fine cloth and fine twill were purchased by dye factories, and over two hundred bags of stock were absorbed by inside and outside stockholders. Yih Wah coarse cloth still offers a lower price, and the industry is still keen on stockpiling. The morning market sold over one hundred bags of loose-end goods at a discount of 5 to 10 cents compared to the market price, then purchased four hundred more pieces of various heavy and light weights as the appetite was not satisfied. Wenzhou merchants also bought more than one hundred pieces, and Hua factories also sold nearly one hundred pieces. The market for bleached and dyed fabrics was stable yesterday, with fall goods rising faster. The factory has already started selling inventory of woolen cloth and serge to customers on this street, and the market has continued to rise due to continued demand. Currently, Hongzhang Three Sheep serge has increased from 42.25 cents to the current market price of 46.5 cents, with very active sales. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants are busy packing and sending parcels day and night, and new sources are being purchased one after another. Transactions of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and other goods reached a total of 400 pieces. Guangdong merchants added more than 4,000 pieces of colored twill and 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of standard blue cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The rise of fine cloth and fine twill was too violent, and the reaction was also strong. Yesterday, due to the short sales in the market, the selling prices were chaotic. Fine cloth dropped by 20 cents per bolt, and fine twill dropped by 5 cents. However, dyeing and sales on this street are still lively, and transactions continue to reach a thousand pieces. Foreign firms did not open up, and the general consensus in the industry is still bullish.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 18th, 220 pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin, and 85 pieces were transported to Yantai.</p>

<p>The sugar market trend remained firm yesterday. The association set the price for No. 24 coarse white, with goods in local warehouses rising another 10 cents, trading at 26.3 yuan. Transshipment goods rose by the same amount, at 18.15 yuan, with 200 bags sold. Taitoo "Che Bai B" mark, goods in the western warehouses became slightly tighter. Chao merchants opened the price for Huanggang Qing at 14.85 yuan, and the next grade at 14.65 yuan, and high-grade "Bannan" Qing at 14.2 yuan, with a total of two to three hundred bags traded.</p>

<p>Sichuan "Banxia," with traffic blocked in Sichuan and supplies relying only on postal deliveries, arrivals are extremely rare. The only substitute is Qingjiang goods, but the selling price must be 40 to 50 yuan lower. However, due to the long-term lack of arrivals, the market has gradually risen. Currently, Qingjiang selected grade is 130 yuan, and mixed grade is 115 to 120 yuan. Used "Banxia" is already priced as high as 180 yuan.</p>
<p>23 tons of gallnut were transported to France and Germany yesterday.</p>

<p>Wire trading has been very smooth recently due to purchases from foreign nail factories and construction gangs. Unfortunately, new goods have not yet been loaded, resulting in concerns about shortages in the market. Therefore, the standard is firm, and small-flower-patterned wire is selling for 15.4 yuan per "dan," which is 20 to 50 cents higher than the previous market price. It was found yesterday that iron shops such as North Suzhou Road opened up more than 200 tons. As for a type of head-end goods, it has also been very firm recently due to the thinness of the market goods, and the market atmosphere is also very strong. The market price is quoted at 12 to 13 yuan per "dan." It was found yesterday that as many as six to seven hundred "dan" were traded, purchased by construction gangs, and retail transactions at stores are still good.</p>

In addition, Japanese warships have also been spotted in the waters of Damao Mountain off Chuanshan in Dinghai County and have now left. The Longshan Wharf in the northwest of Zhenhai County has been thoroughly destroyed by an engineering team dispatched by the Ningbo Defense Department, and coastal defenses have also been re-equipped. The headquarters of the 10th Group Army recently sent a military inspection team, which expressed great satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company, previously commissioned by the German Taifeng Flour Mill in Ningbo, was transporting American wheat to Ningbo to help the people's food supply. The first batch of wheat, totaling 2,000 tons, had been loaded and was about to set sail when the port of Zhenhai was blocked, making it impossible to ship. The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and others requested the Ningbo Defense Command to facilitate imports. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram came from Ningbo, stating that the wheat transportation case had been approved by the General Headquarters. The original telegram is as follows: (omitted above) "Approved the Chamber of Commerce to notify Taifeng Factory that the Commander-in-Chief has ordered the opening of the Taifeng Factory to import purchased wheat. In addition to sending telegrams to Chairman Huang and Commander-in-Chief Liu, this special telegram is for notification. Gu Zhutong," At the same time, the Shanghai office of Taifeng Factory also received a telegram, so it went through the customs clearance procedures. The Ende set sail directly to Ningbo at 4:00 PM yesterday, but only once.</p>
<p>The Hanna Released Directly to Dinghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The German Far East Company's Hanna ship, with the request of the Portuguese Zhengde Company, and the special approval of the Ningbo Defense Command upon receipt of telegrams from the Dinghai Fellow Countrymen Association, etc., was transporting passengers who had been forced to come to Shanghai from the Liberpool back to their homeland. The ship departed from Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday and set sail directly for Dinghai, but only once. In addition to the stranded passengers, the company also sold additional tickets, so the passengers were extremely crowded. It is reported that a part of them were planning to go to Ningbo via Chuanshan, and the ship will return to Shanghai after arriving in Dinghai and will be changed to the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>
<p>Tang Xue San Ships Continue to Unload Goods</p>
<p>The three Portuguese ships Tangbei, Tangqiao, and Tanglu, represented by the American-China American Company, were allowed to unload their goods after being detained. In addition to more than 600 pieces of fresh eggs that had been completely unloaded the day before, foreign miscellaneous goods, north-south goods, etc., were also unloaded yesterday, but due to the lack of large barges, they could not be unloaded all at once. As for the other detained merchant ships, there has been no progress in negotiations, and the goods are still not allowed to be unloaded. It is reported that all Portuguese merchants have expressed extreme indignation at this.</p>
<p>No News of Detained Portuguese Ships</p>
<p>According to the mainland newspaper, yesterday (the 17th), it was learned from officials that the Portuguese Consul General Alfaro had formally protested to the Japanese Consulate regarding the detention of no less than fourteen ships registered under the names of old people. Although it was previously reported that two ships had been taken by Japanese merchants and had their names changed, this rumor could not be confirmed by officials yesterday. The number of crew members and passengers on each ship is unknown, and their fate remains a mystery. The Japanese naval authorities have not issued any further news since admitting that the crew members and passengers were running out of food.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Rent Increase Dispute</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Petition for Rent Increase, Authorities Have Not Yet Officially Accepted</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Report states that a dispute has arisen between rickshaw owners in Shanghai. The rickshaw owners have petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council for a 20% increase in fares. The rickshaw pullers are not willing to be left behind and have also listed several reasons to demand a 30% fare reduction. Both parties are closely watching the official reaction to this movement. The rickshaw owners have recently held several meetings to discuss the issue of rent increases and have petitioned the Municipal Council, but the Municipal Council has not yet officially accepted this petition. Many rickshaw pullers have formed a group and petitioned the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association to help them get a fare reduction. According to a printed document issued to the newspapers by the rickshaw pullers, the Mutual Aid Association refused to send the petition prepared by the rickshaw pullers to the Municipal Council but promised to help them.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Cattle, Sheep and Fresh Pork Industries Sternly Refuse to Participate in the Puppet "Market" – Those Who Participate Privately Have Been Warned – A City-Wide Strike Will Occur if the Environment Worsens <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Apart from the temporary location of the puppet "Livestock Market" at 52 Yuezhou Road in the Public Concession, the General Office is also renting 40 Suzhou Road North. Since the "Market" opened on the 15th of this month, the cattle and sheep, fresh pork, chicken and duck, and other industries have firmly opposed and refused to participate. Therefore, transactions are impossible. Although the Japanese puppets are using a few shameless merchants to prop up the market, it remains deserted from morning till night and business is difficult. According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the general manager of the puppet "Market" is a puppet official, and the deputy manager is a Chinese named Wang Zhiqiang. When asked, various trade associations claimed that there was no such person among their members.</p>
<p>Attempting to Compile Exorbitant Commissions</p>
<p>It is also learned that the purpose of the Japanese puppets in organizing the puppet "Market" this time is entirely to attempt to control transportation and sales. They forcibly require inland merchants to transport all purchased livestock to Shanghai on Russian or Japanese ships. Goods must be sold through the "Market" before they can be picked up, and exorbitant commissions will be charged: ten yuan per head of cattle, two yuan per pig, and one dime per chicken, duck, or goose. The viciousness of their extortion methods is no different from scraping the bone for marrow or draining the pond to catch all the fish.</p>
<p>All Resolved to Not Participate</p>
<p>All livestock industry colleagues have a very firm attitude towards the puppet "Livestock Market." In addition to the fresh pork industry in the city having issued a joint declaration expressing their vow to never yield, it is heard that the cattle and sheep industry colleagues are also unanimously and strongly opposed, and have stated that if the environment worsens, they will decide to go on a city-wide strike. They would rather sacrifice business than bow to the Japanese puppets. It is also heard that some scoundrels in the industry participated privately. They have received warnings from patriotic organizations urging them to withdraw as soon as possible. The chicken and duck industry has also expressed the same sentiment. Furthermore, the fresh pork industry has identified a small number of member firms who have participated, and are currently discussing measures to deal with them.</p>
<p>Fresh Pork Transported to Shanghai Forced to Pay Fees</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Changshun and other 50 fresh pork businesses in Shanghai, after issuing a joint declaration and taking an oath, declaring their position to never participate in any illegal organization, yesterday, hundreds of fresh pigs transported to Shanghai by train were detained by the so-called "Livestock Market" in Hongkou and extorted for subsidies. Pig merchants, because fresh pigs are perishable goods and cannot be delayed, were forced to pay one yuan and one dime per head. The market issued a certificate stating that the said number of fresh pigs had completed the correct procedures and requested that military police along the way verify and release them, etc. However, there was no mention of the amount of money received, nor the name of the responsible person. Now, after being oppressed in this way, fresh pork merchants are extremely indignant and unanimously resolutely oppose it. Some have decided not to transport fresh pigs to Shanghai anymore. If so, there is a danger that the city's meat supply will be cut off.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Commends the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>Sacrificing Their Own Time, Enthusiastically Serving the Public</p>
<p>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, F.C. Maitland, inspected the Public Concession Shanghai Volunteer Corps last Sunday, and expressed his appreciation for the spirit of the members at all levels. Maitland has sent a letter to the commander of the corps, Xiang Peiyi, stating that "All members of the Volunteer Corps sacrifice their own time for the benefit of the public and enthusiastically serve the public, for which the public should be grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e71">Trucks End-to-End, Post Office Parcels Piled Up Like Mountains – More and More Are Sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan – Post Office Staff Work Through the Night <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the number of parcels received by the Shanghai General Post Office yesterday (the 17th) for shipment to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces was unprecedented. This is because goods on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have been congested and unable to be transported for 40 days. At the same time, a large number of parcels sent from home and abroad have also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Transportation Department of the Post Office was extremely busy. Hundreds of post office staff and coolies were busy checking parcels, moving them into post office warehouses, and loading them onto trucks.</p>
<p>Parcel Trucks</p>
<p>were end-to-end, driving from the warehouse to the Jianghai Customs, where customs inspectors inspected the parcels before loading them onto ships bound for Haiphong. Thousands of parcels were piled up around the entrance to the General Office, blocking the road. The amount of mail piled up on both sides of Suzhou Road North between Sichuan Road Bridge and Jiangxi Road Bridge was continuous, showing the sheer volume of postal items. According to inquiries at the Parcel Department yesterday, these parcels contain educational supplies, Chinese medicinal materials, cotton fabrics, cosmetics, and foreign textbooks for university</p>
<p>students in the interior.</p>
<p>An employee in the Parcel Department said that the demand for stationery and other educational supplies in various inland cities is very high. A school exercise book that can be purchased for one dime in Shanghai costs five dimes in Chongqing. The price of ink in Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang is also very expensive. A small bottle of ordinary domestic ink retails for about five dimes. Although the Chinese government prohibits the transport of luxury goods such as cosmetics, a large number of cosmetics are waiting to be transported to Kunming and distributed to other cities in the interior. However, most of the parcels are cotton fabrics such as towels and bed blankets.</p>
<p>Shipment to Haiphong</p>
<p>was halted for 40 days and resumed yesterday. As of yesterday evening, customs officers had inspected approximately 8,000 parcels. Given the large number of parcels still stored in the post office warehouse, it is heard that the staff of the Parcel Department and the Transportation Department may work until midnight every night for over a week to ship these parcels out. However, local merchants still deliver more parcels to the post office for shipment to the interior every day. Currently, only a few ships sail directly from Shanghai to Haiphong, each ship limited to carrying 1,000 parcels. However,</p>
<p>larger ships</p>
<p>can carry about 2,000 parcels each time. The Haiphong post office is quite small and, after the fall of Guangzhou, is unable to cope with the large volume of freight transiting through Vietnam. Moreover, the railway from Haiphong to Hanoi to Kunming is a single track and can only transport a few hundred tons of goods per day, further increasing the difficulty. It is heard that the Haiphong postal authorities have requested the Shanghai postal authorities to telegraph in advance the number of parcels shipped to that location each day to avoid railway traffic</p>
<p>congestion.</p>
<p>According to a rough estimate by Parcel Department personnel, the number of parcels stored in the post office engine room is between 50,000 and 100,000. It is expected that local merchants will deliver even more parcels to the post office for shipment. Parcels sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have already been shipped out yesterday, and a large number of parcels sent from home and abroad have also been shipped into the post office and stored in warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Puppet Troops in Tangkou Mutiny – Guerrilla Forces Seize Eight Machine Guns – More Than 200 Puppet Troops Act as Internal Allies in Combat <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>At 6:00 AM on the 14th of this month, more than 1,000 Chinese guerrilla soldiers detoured from Punan to Lujiahui and contacted the local guerrilla forces. They attacked the puppet First Army garrison in Tangkou in four routes, passing through Zhagang and other places. The Chinese army advanced to Tangkou at 8:00 AM and liaised in advance with a mutinying unit of the puppet "army."</p>
<p>Firing Guns as a Signal</p>
<p>Internal and external attacks were coordinated. Upon reaching the destination, more than 200 puppet "soldiers" surrendered to the Chinese army and captured the three battalion commanders of the puppet "army." More than 200 puppet "soldiers" attempted to resist stubbornly and were killed. The Japanese puppets in Zhoupu Yangsi Bridge rushed to the rescue, but unexpectedly were completely surrounded by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on Both Sides</p>
<p>lasted for a day and night. By 5:00 AM on the 15th, the Japanese puppet army was about to be completely annihilated, so they requested reinforcements from all sides. Even the bandit "puppet" Xu Hongfa's troops were urgently deployed to support them with 300 men. Japanese warships in the Pujiang River indiscriminately fired artillery shells and even landed marines to assist in the battle, finally rescuing the remnants. The fighting ceased at about 7:00 AM. In this battle, the guerrilla forces captured</p>
<p>140 Rifles</p>
<p>eight light machine guns, and captured dozens of puppet "battalion commanders" and squad leaders. Because the guerrilla forces had no fortifications to defend, they moved to the area south of Luhui, near Tairibashi and Jinhuibashi, to hold their ground. At dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese army dispatched 70-80 soldiers, covered by warships, to</p>
<p>land in Zhagang,</p>
<p>Blockading Old Zhagang (leading to Luhui New Market) and Jinhui Port (leading to Jinhui Bridge) waterways. Therefore, the boats sailing to Zhagang New Market and Jinhui Bridge yesterday morning were forced to return upon arriving at the mouth of Zhagang. Transportation between Shangzhaqi, Xinshangjin, and Jinhui was completely cut off.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Claiming to Be the "Patriotic National Salvation Corps" – Intimidating Foreign Business Newspaper – Many English, American, and Chinese Newspapers Received These Letters – The Wording Was Intimidating and the Content Was Absurd <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, four English and two American Chinese-language newspapers each received threatening letters this morning (the 18th) from a group claiming to be the "Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Corps." These "patriotic elements" intend to use bombs and bullets as weapons against the newspapers and said they are willing to perish together with the newspaper staff. The six newspapers are the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the Shanghai Evening Star, the Wenhui Bao, and the Huamei Bao. The Wenhui Bao has published two editorials and</p>
<p>received two letters.</p>
<p>The Huamei Bao is the same. Miles, the publisher of the Huamei Bao, has received similar threats many times in the past two years and is no longer surprised. After receiving the letters, the newspapers immediately reported to the police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession, who are currently investigating the matter. In the past year or two, Shanghai has seen more than one act of terrorists opposing newspapers that are not ideologically pro-Japanese, so these letters will be taken seriously. The case of Chen Guodong, the head of the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury newspaper vendors, being</p>
<p>shot and killed</p>
<p>on Dagu Road at 7:30 PM yesterday, does not seem to have any political meaning because Chen has no connection to politics. However, in September 1937, Chen received letters criticizing him for "selling anti-Japanese newspapers," which may have some connection to the activities of these terrorists. The letter received by a certain English newspaper this morning is as follows: To all newspaper publishers: Since the Incident, members of the media have been unable to break free from the shackles of their thinking, leading to deeper and deeper misunderstandings. In fact, the Kuomintang, under the guise of the Three Principles of the People, has seized political power and manipulated the people, disregarding their hardships and sacrificing the interests of the country to the Western powers as a skill to exploit the people's blood and sweat. None of the promises made at the beginning of the revolution have been fulfilled. As a result, communism, socialism, and other ideologies have taken the opportunity to rise. The Soviet Union's incitement of our country's youth is nothing more than to communize East Asia and disrupt its peace. We patriotic elements, in view of this, have risen up to resist Japan and save our compatriots from the depths of misery, so that our country can complete a splendid and brilliant new nation and strive to maintain permanent independence in the world. However, the media, not understanding the truth, is calling a deer a horse and putting Zhang's hat on Li's head. If you continue to spread absurd remarks and anesthetize our compatriots, it will only be like carrying firewood to put out a fire and harming our people. If you do not change your true colors and comments, our vanguard of national salvation will definitely use force to suppress you. Bombs and bullets will come together. We national salvation elements are willing to perish together with the staff of your newspaper. Don't blame us for not warning you in advance. This is to inform you in advance and wait for your awakening. Sincerely, the Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Corps, April 17, 28th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Since the opening of the Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Through the Ages on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store, it has been an unprecedented success. However, due to the small venue, the audience is extremely crowded and perspiring heavily. Manager Cai of the Great New World, in view of this, has specially increased sponsorship, specially expanding the venue so that the association can increase displays and add seats for the audience to rest. Since yesterday, the association has replaced more than one hundred valuable works, and the number of new and old viewers has doubled. The association has specially increased the number of staff to provide hospitality, which is very busy. Among the works replaced, there are many rare treasures not listed in the catalog, such as Liang Kai's "Sleeping Ape" from the Five Dynasties, with inscriptions by Liao Ying of the Song Dynasty. Ye Gongchuo praised it as Liang Fengzi's best work, making it the most valuable. It is heard that the exhibition period is scheduled to end on the 20th, so there are only today and tomorrow for the exhibition. It is expected that the venue will be unprecedentedly lively, and those who generally love art will definitely not miss this last opportunity.</p>

<p>The Kwangtung, a mail ship on the British company Eurasia Route, left Shanghai for Europe on the 28th of last month. At about 9:00 AM on the 30th, while traveling in the waters between Shantou and Hong Kong, it collided with the French postal company Flandre, which was coming to Shanghai, due to heavy fog. Both ships were severely damaged. The Kwangtung sailed to Hong Kong for repairs, and the Flandre also returned to Hong Kong to enter the dock. This has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the goods and passengers transported to Europe by the Kwangtung have been transferred to the Stretley (transliteration) for transport to Europe. The ship has now been repaired and is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 20th and arrive at the port on the 23rd. It will replace the Stretley on the 25th to return to Europe from Shanghai. It is heard that the Flandre will also be repaired and will be able to leave the dock to come to Shanghai next month. It is now scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Marseilles on May 8. Due to the ship schedule, the trip to Japan has been cancelled.</p>

<p>According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 17th), reporters from various newspapers received a letter in the name of a fake Communist party, directly attacking Britain and France. Last night, when the Japanese side received reporters from various newspapers, it discussed the similarity between the letter and the anti-British and anti-French articles in the newspapers in the Japanese-occupied areas. It was claimed that the Japanese authorities were unaware of this matter and even requested to see the letter. A reporter mentioned a similar section and then said that this may be a joke. However, he heard paper experts claim that the paper used for the letter was manufactured in Japan. This letter is three pages long and contains several sentences stating that Britain and France do not want China to unite, that a certain British munitions factory has secretly aided Japan with the government's permission, that France has also signed a secret agreement with Japan to control parts of Yunnan and Guangxi, and that it allows Japan to act freely in Hainan Island. The letter ends with slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism!" and "Down with all imperialism!"</p>

<p>The mystery of Wang Jingwei's arrival in Shanghai has not been confirmed as of yesterday. According to a reliable source, Wang has left Hanoi, but has not come to Shanghai. However, his two residences on Route Frelupt and Anhsi Temple Road in the French Concession are indeed being actively arranged. Various fellow-countrymen associations continued to hold a dinner party at Tianle Guobing in Hankou Road last night, which was convened by the Shaoxing and Zhenjiang fellow-countrymen associations. Representatives of more than 50 people from Ningbo, Sichuan, Jiujiang, Wenzhou, Wujiang, Jiangning, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Rufou, Guangdong, Kunshan, Zhenjiang, Shaoxing, Taixian, Baoshan, Jiading, Yangshu, Chaozhou, Chening Zhenhai and other fellow-countrymen associations attended. During the meeting, they exchanged disaster relief opinions in detail and unanimously decided to promote fundraising for disaster relief. Yang Gexian, a centenarian, delivered a speech, expressing that the consumer cooperatives for the victims planned to sell calligraphy and painting to raise shares, and said that he had not drunk alcohol for more than 30 years, and was willing to drink a glass today to wish everyone a long life and to encourage them to work hard for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Dongtie Exhibition</p>
<p>Since the planning of the Ancient and Modern Dongtie Exhibition to benefit the victims was started by famous Shanghai celebrities Lin Kanghou, Jian Banghou, and Xu Jichu, it has been enthusiastically supported by all walks of life. Recently, Wang Yizhi and Li Zhaoshi, secretaries of the Dutch Embassy, mailed Zhou Bangjun, the initiator of the association, a letter with a joint war for the Dutch princess' wedding anniversary, invitations to meet with diplomatic personnel from various countries, and poetry, which can be described as exquisite. The Mayor's invitation from the British Red Cross, the Mussolini invitation from overseas Chinese in Italy, and various invitations from Chinese business associations in Nanyang, are all available for the United States and all countries. The spring festival couplets are dazzling and cannot be obtained suddenly. If there is such Dongtie, it can be sent to the Preparatory Office as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Yang Qi, the President of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, went to the court at 9:00 AM yesterday to officially take office, and Yang Peng, the President of the Gao San branch court who was temporarily acting as the President of the Second Special Court, handed over the seal and all documents and records. The former head of the clerk, Wu Shijun, had also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Justice requesting to resign, which was approved. Another telegram appointed Zhou Daren to come to Shanghai to take the position of Head Clerk. Zhou was appointed to come to Shanghai with President Yang Qi and also arrived at the court at 9:00 AM yesterday to take office. After taking office, Yang Qi is still requesting instructions from the Ministry of Justice in Chongqing regarding the date of the swearing-in ceremony, and will schedule it later. After taking office, Yang also met with his subordinates and instructed them to continue to work as usual and not to make any changes for the time being. The new Head Clerk, Zhou Daren, served as the Presiding Judge of the First Special Court in the city in 1920, and after the January 28th Incident, he was transferred to the position of President of the Hebei Xingtai District Court for four years, and then transferred to the position of Judge of the Supreme Court. After the outbreak of the August 13th War of Resistance, the National Government and the Supreme Court moved west to Chongqing, but Zhou did not go.

<p>National Trade</p>
<p>The circulation of funds should not be biased towards the current war between the two major Eastern countries, but in this situation, it would be inhumane not to express deep sympathy for the plight of the Chinese people, many of whom are friends of the Bank. Although the current situation in China presents countless scenes of tragedy and chaos, a development is underway that fills China and the world with hope. I would like to talk about the efforts to establish a new economic plan in the western provinces of China, and the immigration to this underdeveloped area with abundant natural resources. It is estimated that thousands of Chinese people, including merchants and professionals, have now moved to the western frontier. Initially, the problem of finding suitable work for these people seemed unsolvable, but thanks to the enthusiastic efforts and planning of the responsible authorities, I have no hesitation in believing that the Chinese people's adaptability and hard-working characteristics are sufficient to offset the losses caused by one of the greatest tragedies in history with a surplus. Since the beginning of this century, friends of China have repeatedly expressed their hope to the Chinese authorities to open up the wealthy western provinces, to connect Yunnan and Myanmar with trading waterways and to trade with various countries, but this has never been achieved. Now, under the threat of force, China is automatically seeking a raw material outlet across the Burmese border, and significant progress has been made in the construction of trunk roads. These roads connect the important cities of the Republic of China with Myanmar and the navigable points of the Irrawaddy River.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai has not changed significantly from what I saw a year ago and is no different from what the general public knows. Foreign trade there suffered more in 1938 than in other parts of China. Regarding the stability of Chinese currency, I commented on it a year ago. Due to the establishment of the puppet United Reserve Bank of Peiping and Tianjin and the issuance of new "puppet" currency in North China, the Chinese government's restriction on the sale of British pounds and other foreign currencies has been damaged. Although foreign exchange has a designated amount in a few months, the exchange rate from Shanghai to London has fallen rapidly, from one shilling and two pence twenty-five.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Southwest Opium Poppy Disappears; Fields are Planted with Grain; Broadcasting of Narcotics in Occupied Areas is the Opposite; Dr. Dyke, Upon Returning to Shanghai After a Pleasant Journey, Sighs and Speaks; The Entire Chinese People Unite to Support the Government <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Press reports that Dr. Dyke, secretary of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, recently traveled through the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, a journey of two thousand miles, and has now returned to Shanghai. According to what he told reporters, the Japanese authorities in the occupied areas are currently cultivating the evils of narcotics, while the "free" China, directly managed by the National Government, is rapidly freeing its people from drug addiction. Throughout his journey, in what used to be the most famous opium poppy growing areas in China, he hardly saw a single red poppy flower. Only in some mountainous areas of Yunnan Province did he find poppies still being planted, likely because the government authorities there could not reach those areas, or they were not affected by the government's anti-drug education program. This shows that the achievements in the areas occupied by the invaders, such as Nanjing and other occupied cities, are the opposite of the achievements in the areas governed by China itself, like day and night. Five years ago, when Mr. Dyke was returning to New York, he traveled through western China and saw opium poppies everywhere in Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces. The smell of opium was noticeable in the streets, and this kind of narcotic was openly sold and smoked everywhere. Vendors selling narcotics were all prospering. But today, shops selling opium have all closed, and the smell is no longer detectable. The opium poppies in the fields have all been eradicated, replaced by new grains needed for life. Another change in West China that earned Mr. Dyke's praise was the huge construction projects now underway in the interior, which promise to promote agricultural development. Mr. Dyke also said that in Sichuan, he inspected the plans of the Provincial Agricultural Improvement Bureau. This bureau is managed by three agricultural experts who studied in the United States, and their work includes distributing improved seeds to farmers, teaching them new cultivation methods, eliminating plant diseases and pests, and developing new serums to treat livestock diseases. Currently, the bureau has two large stations near Chengdu, and they are making extensive use of the discoveries made in the laboratories of Jinling University and West China Union University. They also recruit hundreds of young farmers to the two stations for three months of training on a regular basis. The development of agriculture in Sichuan Province owes much to the efforts of these people. Before Dr. Dyke arrived in Chongqing, he entered Yunnan Province from Burma via the newly built Yunnan-Burma Highway. It is said that this highway is a great achievement that overcame enormous difficulties, which is almost unbelievable. The workers used almost entirely indigenous tools and worked for twelve months to complete it. The quality of the project is quite good. There are still thousands of workers working on various parts of the highway, especially many workers working in the narrow mountain passes to improve it. At the same time, thousands of others are straightening out the curves and building bridges to make the highway more suitable. According to Dr. Dyke, the highway will be severely tested when the rainy season arrives in western Yunnan, and it seems that it should not be relied upon too much as a reliable route. However, given the insurmountable difficulties that have been overcome, and the tremendous achievements that have been made, it is not appropriate to rush to judgement before the event. While in Chongqing, Dr. Dyke and his traveling companion, Dr. Claypool, were invited to a tea party hosted by Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang. The Chairman and his wife expressed their gratitude for the assistance given by foreign friends and expressed their conviction that China would achieve final victory. Although Chairman Chiang, the leader of China, has to attend many meetings, he is still energetic and not at all tired. Dr. Dyke also praised the unity of the entire Chinese people, saying that the Chinese people have an optimistic and courageous spirit and fully support the National Government. The unity of the country shows no sign of cracking. It is reported that Dr. Dyke came to Shanghai briefly last November and then went to Madras, India to attend the International Missionary Conference. After the conferences were over, he traveled extensively in the Chinese interior for nearly half a year. He is scheduled to return to the United States next week on the Yu Shou. As for the eight foreign exchanges, from June of last year to the present, the exchange rate has remained the same. The market situation has only seen mild contractions and expansions. Maintaining the stability of Chinese currency and trade with the United Kingdom is extremely important. On March 8th, the Secretary of Finance announced the establishment of a currency stabilization fund of ten million pounds sterling. Because this bank was granted a guarantee by the British Treasury to compensate for losses, it participated in this effort. Its establishment is undoubtedly intended for this purpose, and it is welcomed. Other than indirectly, this amount is unrelated to North China. This issue will cause the British, American, and French governments to lodge serious protests with Japan. As mentioned previously, because the Shanghai foreign exchange rate has been able to maintain a relatively stable basis since June of last year, foreign assistance has only been normal and intermittent in nature. Although the situation still has some unstable signs, we have good reason to hope that this stabilization fund will be effective. I have already given you a brief report on the impact of the damage to the trade in the major areas where this bank has branches.</p>
<p>The Main Reason</p>
<p>I would like to offer a simple suggestion on a matter that I believe will have a significant impact on international trade in the future. This is the Anglo-American Trade Agreement. I would like to call this agreement the British Empire-American Trade Agreement, because its text stipulates that it is not only about trade between the United States and Great Britain. This is an effort by two major countries to improve the management of goods trade, simplify it to encourage trade development, and seek the actual benefits of all parties involved. Our government has given the Export Credits Guarantee Department more power so that it can provide extensive assistance to our country's export trade. I very much welcome this decision by the government. If the global situation can become stable, the improvement of world trade and the increase in raw material prices will also improve the living standards of the eastern countries that we are very concerned about, which will not be difficult to achieve, etc. The Chairman's report and the 1938 accounts were unanimously approved by the attendees. The directors and auditors whose terms had expired were quickly re-appointed, and a vote of thanks was passed to the Chairman, directors, managers, and staff for their good work. A special meeting was then held to present the plan to transform the bank's charter to the attendees, which was also unanimously passed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Salary Restoration Measures</p>
<p>Original salaries restored for those below 30 yuan, universal 10% increase for those above 30 yuan</p>
<p>Since the salary restoration movement at The Commercial Press last year, initial negotiations have repeatedly yielded little progress. In order to achieve their demands, the Mutual Aid Society of the Press sent three representatives to Hong Kong at the end of January this year to meet with the general manager of the Press and explain the difficult situation of the staff, requesting salary restoration. After several discussions, they finally obtained the general manager's understanding, who agreed to find ways to restore discounts during the spring sales in order to alleviate the staff's difficulties. The representatives were convinced of the general manager's sincere attitude and returned to Shanghai to await the actual results. It was recently heard that the company officially announced the salary restoration measures on the 17th, stipulating that from April, monthly salaries below 30 yuan would be restored to their original levels, and those above 30 yuan would receive a universal increase of 10%. Thus, the salary restoration movement that had lasted for several months came to an end. The Society believes that its decision to demand salary restoration was deeply supported by all sectors of society and has sent letters of gratitude to the Public Works Department, the International Labour Organization's China Branch, and various agencies.</p>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs, Lu Declares</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics Not Banned for Transport</p>
<p>Lace Also Exempt from Transport Ban</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Economic Affairs requesting permission for silk satin being blocked from transport to Shanghai. The Ministry responded with a telegram stating, "Upon investigation, silk fabrics have not been designated as prohibited goods and are therefore not subject to the transport ban. As for the two items prohibited for transport, hemp, cotton, and their products, lace and other hemp and cotton fabrics are also not included and should be exempt from the transport ban." In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance ordering the customs to comply, a telegram is hereby sent for your information. Ministry of Economic Affairs, seal.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Great Achievements of Father Jacquinot (III) by Zhao Erqian <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot's life is simple. Besides prayer and work, he seems to do nothing else. He wears the black robe worn by priests, and on his head, he wears the small hat that Frenchmen like to wear, the Buney, with a small anchor fixed to the front. On the left lapel hangs the emblem of the International Red Cross, and in his hand, he carries a gold-edged leather-bound breviary. Apart from that, he has nothing else. Since the Paris government awarded him the Legion of Honor, he has fastened a red, white, and blue silk ribbon on his button, indicating that he has received the honor of Chevalier. He has large eyes, a pair of large ears, and a thick mustache hanging on his mouth, showing a smiling and benevolent appearance. His nose is prominent and hooked downwards, which the Chinese call a dragon falcon, and foreigners say he looks like a Jew. His body is tall and majestic, much like an Anglo-American rather than a Latin. In terms of temperament, he is a kind-hearted, approachable, planning, courageous, and very determined person. He has very little free time, cherishing every moment. In addition to refugee affairs, he also gives speeches, attends meetings, and preaches. When he presides over and announces a meeting or discusses refugee issues, he presses his left arm tightly on the table and speaks eloquently, expressing his own views in an orderly and well-organized manner. His attitude seems a bit autocratic, but in fact, what he proposes is exactly the solution that everyone wants to say but has not yet formed, so everyone wholeheartedly agrees and asks him to implement it. Every Sunday, he often preaches in the Catholic Church, urging the audience to extend their love for God to love for others, sacrificing the small self to achieve the greater self. His words are sincere and his language is moving, often ending with charitable work and refugee issues. Afterwards, he is in the reception room, receiving guests with a smile, kindly and benevolently. Regardless of Chinese or foreign, noble or lowly, old or young, male or female, everyone can get a few words from him that make people feel a kind of comfort in their hearts. He is so relaxed, chatting and laughing, without any signs of fatigue, dealing with people in a way that transcends worldly concerns, forgetting his own week's fatigue and exhaustion, making you resolve to see him again. This priest is not only a magnet for attracting friends but also understands the psychology and needs of each individual. I once saw him tightly hold the hands of a newly married couple and say, "Are you good to her? Are you good to him? I hope you come often." His words were kind, like a loving mother caring about the happiness of her children. Another person who fled to the concession wanted to know the situation of his property in Hongkou. He asked Father Jacquinot to find out. The next day, Father Jacquinot returned and took out a piece of broken tile from his pocket, proving that everything this gentleman owned had become ashes and rubble. In short, Father Jacquinot is a comfort to the distressed, a savior to the poor, and with him, the difficult problems of human form and spirit are largely solved.</p>
<p>After Mr. Jacquinot disappeared and arrived in Shanghai, he made a statement saying that he had traveled in China for a long time and regarded China as his second hometown. His enthusiasm for loving China is no less than that of the Chinese people. The donations he raised in the United States have reached US$700,000, and all expenses are covered by the fundraisers, so not a penny will be used from the donations. This spirit of "all drops return to the public" is truly thought-provoking and worthy of emulation. He is not only "a friend of China" and "the father of refugees" but also a patriotic "Chinese!"</p>

<p>The youths Huang Xin, Liu Fuqiu, Huang Chuanwen, Hua Minxiang, Zhang Ronggao, Zhang Caiyi, Jiang Bofang, Fei Guishun, Jin Huiquan, etc., have all received considerable education, and most of them are former classmates of the Beigong School in Zhabei. However, Huang and others associated with the wrong people and specialized in low-level behavior, resulting in all of them being subject to legal sanctions for committing fraud and obtaining property. After their release from prison, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and Huang and others saw an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. They borrowed names such as the "Iron-Blooded Youth Eradication Corps" and the "National Salvation Youth Service Society," made badges, seals, and receipts, and went to various woolen and dye businesses within the jurisdiction of the Old Zhabei General Police Station, claiming to be</p>
<p>Investigating Enemy Loans</p>
<p>They conducted arbitrary inspections. If they believed that the goods of the business were slightly suspicious, they would take them away. Although they issued receipts after taking the goods, the general businesses, because the goods taken away were either of unclear origin or were indeed enemy goods, all endured in silence. Huang and others sold or pawned the goods they obtained, or distributed them to make new clothes. The money they obtained was used for pleasure. Huang and others knew that the businesses had hidden illnesses and</p>
<p>Dared Not Speak Out</p>
<p>Therefore, they were bold and reckless, and the number of crimes they committed was innumerable. Recently, Chief Detective Yun Agen and Detective Chen Yonggui of the Old Zhabei Police Station obtained clues and supervised detectives Wang Shusen, Gao Yong'an, Shan Zhaoxian, etc., in rooms 25 and 1204 of the Great Shanghai Hotel, arresting Huang and others and a woman, Lu Qunying (also known as Wang Xiaomei). They confiscated a pistol, four bullets, seven "Iron-Blooded Eradication Youth Corps" badges, one "National Salvation Youth Service Society" seal, and</p>
<p>Nine Receipt Books</p>
<p>It was found that Huang and others had used weapons to rob property in the following places: (1) Gongtai Woolen Shop at 263 Fuzhou Road, robbed of fabrics worth 531 yuan; (2) Chen Xinda Dye Shop at 20, Lane 237, Guangdong Road, robbed of 250 yuan in cash; (3) Qingshun Cotton Cloth Shop at 4, Lane 207, Ningbo Road, robbed of 500 yuan worth of cotton cloth; (4) Renchang Woolen Shop at 268 Tianjin Road, robbed of 100 yuan worth of fabric; (5) Huacheng Cotton Cloth Shop at 21, Lane 796, Beijing Road, robbed of 700 yuan worth of fabric; (6) Rongtai Woolen Shop at 10, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, robbed of 1,300 yuan worth of woolen fabric; (7) Cai Hongji Hardware Shop at 6, Lane 542, Ningbo Road, robbed of 1,000 yuan worth of</p>
<p>Loans and Other Cases</p>
<p>Part of the goods were recovered, as well as gold and diamond rings that Huang and others had pawned. It was also found that Liang Cuoli, the owner of Guangxinfeng Shop on Guangdong Road, and Chen Quanlin, who lived at 11, Lane 32, Qipu Road, had received stolen goods from Huang and others at low prices. Therefore, they were all prosecuted in the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, judge Feng Jude of the First Criminal Court heard the case. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Yue Junwei to defend them. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted Huang and others for robbery and Jin Huiquan, Chen Quanlin, and Liang Cuoli for</p>
<p>Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>At the same time, it was stated that the defendants took advantage of the unspeakable pain of various businesses and seized the opportunity to rob them. They also carried weapons and borrowed the name of patriotic organizations to achieve their purpose of robbing property, which was particularly abhorrent and should be severely punished according to law. Then, the case was presented, which lasted for more than an hour. After the court questioned each defendant, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to a later date. The defendants were returned to custody. It is heard that Huang and others also committed seven similar cases in the French Concession. Therefore, after the First Special Court finishes the hearing, the Second Special Court has also requested that the defendants be transferred for investigation and interrogation.</p>

<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that Mrs. Davis, a British woman, was insulted by a Japanese Consulate police officer on the Garden Bridge yesterday (the 17th). Mr. Davis has now hired a lawyer from the Senior Evening News. It is heard that he will demand 95,000 yuan in compensation for medical expenses and the mental suffering of Mrs. Davis. It is also heard that the British Consul-General is currently meeting with a lawyer from the Senior Evening News to hear the details and may lodge a strong protest because of this matter. Mrs. Davis may be admitted to a mental hospital to treat the trauma to her nervous system. Mr. Davis is currently discussing the matter further with his lawyer. According to Mrs. Davis, she was stopped by a Japanese Consulate police officer when she passed the Garden Bridge yesterday. The police officer said that she did not bow to the sentry. Mrs. Davis replied that although she was Japanese, she had married a British man, so she was also British. The Japanese police officer was very angry and dragged Mrs. Davis into a small room behind the sentry box on the bridge and mocked her, saying, "You think you are superior to the Japanese. Marrying a British man does not make you omnipotent." Mr. Davis said that his wife had always sympathized with the Japanese, but now she has suffered this blow, and her sympathy has been greatly diminished.</p>

<p>At approximately 10:30 last night, four bandits wearing short clothes and carrying guns suddenly went to the residence of the Yan family at 8 Anhe Temple Road in the Western District to rob them. The owner, Yan Xingfang, and others were not yet asleep. When they saw that the intruders were not friendly, they immediately secretly pressed the doorbell button and reported to the police departments of the Public and French Concessions. As a result, detectives quickly gathered. The bandits in the house suddenly heard a lot of voices outside and knew that things were not going well. They had no time to rob and turned around to flee, but because detectives from both concessions had surrounded the area, they opened fire first, and the detectives returned fire. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, firing a total of thirty to forty shots. Three bandits were shot down and captured, and taken back to the police station. The detectives searched around after the incident and arrested sixteen suspects in the vicinity, who were also taken to the police station for interrogation. The homeowner suffered no losses.</p>

<p>The ninth period of the French Charity Lottery to benefit refugees will be drawn on May 3. As the date of the draw approaches, the number of buyers is increasing. It is also learned that since the general sales office, the Dagong Enterprise Company branch office, sold the second prize ticket number 28931 in the seventh period and the first prize ticket number 31607 in the eighth period, the number of people buying tickets from the company's branch office has become even more enthusiastic. Therefore, to facilitate ticket purchases by ladies, the branch office will extend its business hours from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM starting today. Also, because the lottery tickets are increasingly trusted, the number of sales businesses has increased to 250, which have been set up throughout the two concessions of Shanghai.</p>

<p>Last month, on the 19th, Xie Zhiguang, a Chinese detective of the Dixiwei Road Police Station, and Zhao Lianbi, a detective, arrested six notorious robbers, Xu Yongquan, Wang Yushan, Zhu Yunlong, Shen Yougen, Chen Haibin, and Jiang Xianghong, in various places such as Haig Road and Yuyuan Road. Four pistols and thirty-two bullets were seized. It was found that they had colluded with Li Arei, who was still at large, to rob the homes of Yao Jiafei and Pan Ximan, Chinese detectives at 339 Daxilu Road, and Liang Weiming at 7, Lane 156, Yidingpan Road, taking property and two pistols. On the 11th of last month, they broke into the home of Wang Zhiyue at 39, Lane 189, Kainer Road, and kidnapped Zhang Zhisan and took him away, obtaining 7,000 yuan in ransom. The case was sent to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, judge Xiao Peishen of the Second Criminal Court announced the verdict yesterday morning. Xu Yongquan, Wang Yushan, Zhu Yunlong, Yao Yougen, and Chen Haibin were sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping for ransom and robbery, and were deprived of their civil rights for life. Jiang Xianghong was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. The pistols and bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e86">After the Fake "Section Chief" Wang Xianming Was Killed; The Corpse's Wife Signed and Received the Body for Burial; One Knife Wound to the Chest Was the Fatal Wound <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xianming, a fake "Chief of the First Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government" from Anhui (a pseudonym of Wang Huanzhang), was 52 years old this year. He lived with his wife, Mrs. Yao (43 years old from Shaoxing), at 71, Lane 190, Mett Herst Road in the western district of Shanghai. Every morning, he went to the fake "Municipal Government" in the city center to work and returned home when he finished his errands in the evening. He usually kept a low profile and had very little contact with the outside world. At 7:30 PM on the 17th, he was suddenly lured by patriotic volunteers to outside the back door of 8890 Huagenei Road, French Concession, next to a garbage can in Hongyun Lane. He was stabbed violently in the heart with a sharp knife and died on the spot. Residents in the lane discovered the body and called the police. After inspecting the scene, they reported to the French Police Station, which sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. A murder weapon (a seven-inch long sharp knife) and notes were found next to the body and taken back to the police station. The corpse was taken to the morgue for examination. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the French police station found the corpse's family that night and notified the corpse's wife, Wang Yao, to come to the station. Yesterday, the case was reported to prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, went to the morgue of the Public Works Department Hospital on Tallas Road at 11:00 AM to examine the corpse. After the examination, they sat in the courtroom. The detective reported the investigation after the incident. The corpse's wife, Wang Yao, applied to receive the corpse for burial. The official ruled that Wang Huancao, that is, Wang Xianming, was indeed stabbed to death. The corpse was handed over to Wang Yao for burial. The sharp knife was still handed over to the original detective to be taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>(Another report) Yesterday's newspaper reported that the fake "clerk of the First Section of the Municipal Government," Wang Xianming, was killed. According to news from the fake staff, the deceased's real name was Wang Huanzhang, 51 years old, from Anhui. He was the accounting director of the First Section of the fake Municipal Government, with a monthly salary of 140 yuan. Wang was originally an employee of the former Unified Taxation Bureau. Since becoming the fake "director," he had made many enemies because he was manipulating the economy. Therefore, the fake staff speculate that the murder was due to a private feud. The "Chinese Eradication Corps" note found next to the body was intended to shift the target.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that the Japanese Consulate General issued a press release at 5:30 PM yesterday (the 17th), stating that the Japanese Consulate authorities yesterday submitted a proposal to the Public Concession Public Works Department regarding the assassination of Dr. Xi Shitai, the "Secretary of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Police Bureau," requesting the implementation of more stringent measures to prevent terrorist crimes in the Public Concession. The press release stated as follows: Japanese Consul General Miura, due to the assassination of Dr. Xi Shitai on April 11, visited Public Works Department Director-General Fanning at 3:45 PM, accompanied by Terazaki, and submitted a proposal regarding the aforementioned unfortunate incident. Furthermore, Miura requested that the understanding reached between the Japanese authorities and the Public Works Department regarding preventing the activities of terrorists in the Public Concession be strictly implemented in the future.</p>
<p>Ewo Cotton Mill</p>
<p>Expands Dyeing and Bleaching Department</p>
<p>Ewo Cotton Mill, managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., has a long history and is the pioneer of foreign-owned cotton mills in China. Due to its perfect management and the right people in charge, it has had profits every year. In 1938, it even exceeded all previous records, with a net profit of over 6 million yuan. It is heard that the original stock price of five taels has risen to a peak of over 20 yuan. As the mill's business is developing rapidly, it is expanding its original dyeing and bleaching department, adding factory buildings and purchasing a large number of machines. It has also hired Mr. Zhou Jiajun as the engineer of the department and Mr. Dong Jiufeng to be in charge of business affairs. Mr. Zhou was previously an engineer at the Qingfeng Factory and has rich knowledge and experience. He is a well-known talent in the dyeing and bleaching industry. Mr. Dong also has a long-standing reputation in the cotton cloth industry and has close relationships with various customers. With the right assistants, the excellent results of the factory can be assured. The new product, "Yizhichun" bleached cloth, has already started selling, and the remaining products will be launched one after another.</p>

<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>If Chamberlain's appeasement policy toward Germany and Italy can be considered a lion's roar, then Roosevelt's demand to Hitler and Mussolini for guarantees not to invade other countries' territories for ten years can be considered a bolt from the blue. Under this thunderous sound, of course, some people are flustered, deliberately pretending to be nonchalant, unwilling to show weakness after all.</p>
<p>What kind of repercussions this giant sound will have in Europe, we will soon hear, so let's put it aside for now. However, what follows this giant sound is a fleet like a cloud formation, entering the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic. What impact this has on the Far Eastern countries on the Pacific side, I think, is what we should pay the most attention to at present.</p>
<p>According to the newspapers of the past two days, Pittman, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, has repeatedly advocated sanctions against Japan. This time, the movement of the fleet is quite sufficient as a backing for this proposal. Senator William King's remarks are even more blatant, believing that the U.S. Navy's movement aims to prevent Japan from coveting the Philippines or the Dutch East Indies. Other "authoritative sources" believe that Japan's second attack target is Hong Kong, and the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific can make Japan slightly restrain its ambitions. Therefore, the Tokyo Reuters dispatch stated that "the naval circles here are greatly surprised," which shows that it is not a casual performance.</p>
<p>According to my guess, the alliance of democratic countries has been completed, and what they are dealing with is not only Germany and Italy in Europe, but Japan in the Far East must also be included. As for the method of dealing with them, it seems that they have been assigned their respective responsibilities: in Europe, if Germany and Italy launch an attack, then Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries will surround and strike hard, while the United States will provide support in terms of arms and economy; in the Far East, if Japan takes another step forward, then the United States will impose sanctions nearby, while the colonies of Britain and France will provide convenience in various aspects. In other words, on the east coast of the Atlantic, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the main players, and the United States is the secondary player; on the west coast of the Pacific, the United States is the main player, and Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the secondary players, thus solving the various fascist countries separately.</p>
<p>If a world war ultimately and unfortunately breaks out, my guess will probably not be too far from the truth. Because European countries cannot reach the Far East, they have no choice but to entrust the affairs of the western Pacific to the United States, which has a superior position and all kinds of power, which is inevitable in the situation.</p>
<p>Of course, the Soviet Union will not stand idly by in the Far East. However, its special responsibility seems to be on the continent, unlike the United States, which is specifically responsible for the Pacific, so we still have to look forward to the United States' performance in the Pacific.</p>

<p>The sky, like a widow, wore a sullen face, strangely stuffy.</p>
<p>——"Report! The enemy army is passing through Zhujiazhuang to the west and seems to be advancing here."</p>
<p>A young peddler said breathlessly.</p>
<p>——"How many people?"</p>
<p>——"More than two hundred!"</p>
<p>——"Humph!"</p>
<p>The peddler left, leaving behind a temporary silence; afterwards, Battalion Commander Feng ordered: Gather the troops and resist!</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan and Zhao Ming were machine gunners.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan looked at the black muzzle of the gun, which seemed to have a different kind of mystery:</p>
<p>"Mom, help me today, old brother!"</p>
<p>Zhao Ming looked at Zhang Xiaosan and smiled. Xiaosan felt embarrassed and said casually:</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? It all depends on it to drive the devils back to their hometown!"</p>
<p>"Don't make a sound, Xiaosan!"</p>
<p>"Da da da—"</p>
<p>The enemy was again firing bullets, and a wisp of light smoke floated in the air.</p>
<p>A cluster of enemies rushed towards here.</p>
<p>The command from above came: "Open fire!"</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan's machine gun muzzle spat out flames.</p>
<p>"Mom, these dead ghosts!"</p>
<p>Several enemies fell, but still rushed towards here, vaguely emitting a cry.</p>

<p>"We don't fight our own people—ah!"</p>
<p>"—Brothers, stop firing!"</p>
<p>"—We are here to surrender—…"</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan heard it, Zhao Ming heard it, and the ordinary brothers all heard it, thinking in their hearts: "How strange!"</p>
<p>"Da da da…"</p>
<p>The enemies fell continuously, and behind the enemies, dense sparks also flashed.</p>
<p>The command from above came: "Stop firing!"</p>
<p>The enemies got closer and closer, and this side shouted</p>
<p>"Lay down your guns or we'll open fire!"</p>
<p>One gun after another fell to the ground, with sparks following behind the enemies.</p>
<p>"Compatriots! Welcome!"</p>
<p>"Brothers, we have returned to the embrace of our mother."</p>
<p>The enemy—no, now they are brothers on the same battle line! That captain shook our Battalion Commander Feng's hand, and the hot blood of patriotism flowed in the palm of their hands…</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan opened his mouth in surprise, looking at the dark-faced captain, his heart like a cauldron of oil, frying an exciting and fantastic idea.</p>
<p>"Big brother!" Zhang Xiaosan suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>The dark-faced captain turned his head, his eyes fixed on Zhang Xiaosan, his wide lips trembling:</p>
<p>"Xiaosan, you're here!"</p>
<p>They embraced, tears of excitement flowing, blood cells of loyalty flowing in their blood vessels.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosan counted in his heart: seven years, seven years of separation, and today we meet on the battlefield!</p>
<p>The enemy army was firing cannons to vent their anger, and finally, they were immersed in a bloody battle again…</p>
<h3 id="e90">Mr. Lu <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Xu</p>
<p>Mr. Lu is over there again expressing his profound opinions! His head, shaking back and forth, the blue veins on his forehead protruding:</p>
<p>"Alas! The Chinese people of today are really terrible: um: so I say: everyone over the age of ten should die: yes: should all die:" He deliberately repeated the last sentence. His head shook triumphantly a couple more times.</p>
<p>"Then what about you? Should you die too? That would be a pity!" Someone was teasing him in jest.</p>
<p>"Um: that: that: that: of course: let my children live: and wait for them to transform China:" His face flushed even redder.</p>
<p>"Ha: but your two daughters: when they ask people for candy, their ability is no less than those bureaucrats who were good at fleecing the people in the past!"</p>
<p>"Um: that: that:"</p>
<p>"Hahaha:" Causing a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu is only in his thirties, but he always likes to express this kind of pedantic nonsense. Sometimes, if his colleagues ask him:</p>
<p>"Then what about our old principal? Should he die too?"</p>
<p>He would say contemptuously: "Oh! Of course! To be honest: these fifty or sixty-year-old geezers are no good: Look at those traitors in the two puppet governments, aren't they all fifty or sixty years old?"</p>
<p>"But: Mr. Lu: how old is your respected father?"</p>
<p>"Ah:… that… that" Then there was another burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's respected father is already over sixty, but he still left home with great difficulty, following the government to the west to serve the country; but Mr. Lu himself said as soon as the government moved to Hankou:</p>
<p>"Um… I should resign!… My family is still in Shanghai…" So he ran back! Leaving his old father alone there.</p>
<p>When people said that he should go to the inland to serve the country and take care of his old father, his face would flush red again and he would stammer:</p>
<p>"Um: that: that: there is also a lot of work in Shanghai: Moreover: I still have a family…</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Meaning of Life <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Qiang Tou Cao</p>
<p>In the process of time, due to the ever-changing external things, constantly stimulating and reacting, life naturally changes its content; in essence, local changes in quantity increase or decrease, and at a certain stage, it forms the death and rebirth of the entire quality.</p>
<p>The true meaning of life lies in creation. But creation is just a necessary means to complete the enjoyment of "created value." Therefore, to keep enjoying, you must first keep creating. This way, life will not be wasted meaninglessly.</p>
<p>Those who are stingy with life are cowards. Those who waste life are madmen. Those who do not know what life is are idiots. Those who recognize life as an illusion are ghosts.</p>
<p>If you are a warrior at the forefront of an era, then you should cherish life, hold it tightly, and not let go for a moment; indulge in faith, and ideals. Sometimes you should also stake your life on it, and die for it!</p>

<h3 id="e94">Elegance and Vulgarity <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Xie</p>
<p>In the past, the elegant scholar Ni Yunlin was captured by Zhang Shixin in Taihu Lake one day and beaten to near death because he refused to paint for Zhang Shixin. However, he did not say a word while being beaten. Someone asked him the reason, and he said: Once I open my mouth, it becomes vulgar.</p>
<p>Unbelievable, such an elegant scholar, not even caring for his life, is truly rare. However, isn't there a hint of excessive elegance in such affectation? Because in my opinion, not opening your mouth can only be considered tough and unyielding, which is a good man, unrelated to elegance. If the intention is to take this as elegance, then it is too elegant and becomes vulgar.</p>
<p>Too elegant becomes vulgar, just like what the Scholars said, "Too elegant becomes too vulgar." Often, general calligraphers and painters, at the drop of a hat, drink wine and admire flowers, chant poems and write prose, claiming to be elegant, which made Wu Jingzi greatly ridicule them, and it is still a topic of conversation to this day.</p>
<p>Speaking of this kind of elegance, it seems that the remaining charm still exists today, or it has even intensified, with everything being elegant and nothing being vulgar. Needless to say, even the elegant seals, aliases, and pen names of a few people have exhausted the spectacle of elegance, making people sigh at the ultimate in elegance. At one time, names were always represented by flowers, birds, insects, and fish, and accompanied by mournful and sorrowful adjectives. This can be said to be a soft-style elegance. Now, it has finally changed, and all use □□□□, □口口口 and other words to name themselves. This may be said to be a hard-style.</p>
<p>I am not saying that these names are not elegant at all. On the contrary, I admit their elegance. However, once one person initiates it, many people follow suit, and any elegant thing becomes unbearably vulgar, just like Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty was an elegant person with many elegant deeds, while people like Tang Bohu and Zhang Mengjin of the Ming Dynasty, imitating Handan, acting affectedly, made people want to vomit.</p>
<p>It is certainly not easy to define elegance and vulgarity. However, I say, there seems to be some scope here, in addition to the initiator being elegant and the follower being vulgar, there is also: the intentional is vulgar, and the unintentional is elegant. The vulgarity of Ni Yunlin, I say, is because of his intention. He was originally a person from the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties, which coincided with what the Carnal Prayer Mat said, that every Yuan person had an alias, so he was named Yunlinzi, which is one of the symbols of his vulgarity. As for his deliberately liking cleanliness, he was merely learning from Mi Yuanzhang, and only made his vulgarity reek to the nose. What Party Discipline did by writing poems in Beijing and Hanoi can be seen in the same light: pretending to be elegant, vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!</p>
<p>Mo Junli's "Posing" — imitating Gao Junerji's elegance — is a portrait of these elegant people. I want to collect this material, but I am afraid that there are countless examples from ancient times to the present, which can be loaded with carts and measured with dou and peck, and fill the building with sweat-inducing bamboo slips — using two "zhi" characters, the literary air becomes elegant.</p>
<p>However, elegant affairs are only for scholars, and illiterate dullards have no share; therefore, since there is the too elegant of scholars turning into vulgarity, there is also the too vulgar of dullards turning into elegance. Party Taiwei's gold-selling account, with lamb wine, is this clear proof, and Liangshan Black Whirlwind's opening mouth "old man" and closing mouth "iron ox" are really charming and lovely, and definitely not vulgar. Even A Q under Lu Xun's pen, a few sounds of "I want…" I also consider him the number one elegant person of modern times. Why? It's just because of their pure innocence, unintentional in elegance, and what they say and do, without seeing the ancients before or the comers after, but naturally wonderfully unique throughout the ages, so vulgar that it is too elegant.</p>
<p>Among the scholars, Huang Shanguo had some reason: when he arrived in Xuanzhou, someone asked him to write calligraphy, and he never refused anyone who asked; someone felt sorry for him because he gave it to vulgar people, and he laughed and said, "Bring me a non-vulgar person to see." This statement is truly extremely happy! Conversely, who is an elegant person? Who is not a vulgar person? Compared to this, we can also see some of the truth about elegance and vulgarity.</p>
<p>I often hear people say that "an article should be done in a way that both the elegant and the vulgar can appreciate it" in order to be a wonderful article. I don't quite believe this, because the elegant can appreciate it, but the vulgar may not be able to appreciate it, and what the vulgar can appreciate, the elegant may not necessarily be able to appreciate. Therefore, I think, maybe "elegance and vulgarity cannot appreciate together" is a wonderful article. As for my non-wonderful article, which is difficult to be elegant and difficult to be harmonious with vulgarity, I can only say "elegance and vulgarity cannot appreciate together."</p>

<h3 id="e95">"The World of Tomorrow" <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The 1939 New York World's Fair will open on April 30 and close on October 30. During this six-month period, the anticipated number of visitors will be no less than 50 million, and the number of tourists coming from overseas alone will be more than 3 million. The venue is located in the newly reclaimed lake and swamp area along Flushing Bay on Long Island, about three and a half miles long and more than 1,200 acres wide. The construction project took two years and cost 165 million yuan. A total of 1,500 units participated in the exhibition, including</p>
<p>sixty-two countries, a grand occasion shown in previous exhibitions. According to the authorities in the meeting, this meeting has a very valuable contribution to the promotion of international goodwill. One significant difference between this exhibition and previous exhibitions is that the previous exhibitions mostly focused on the display of past products, while this meeting attempts to predict the future. Therefore, its official name is</p>
<p>The World of Tomorrow. The various buildings of the branch, and what is displayed in them, all strive to meet this point. The various buildings in the meeting are its most obvious feature. Most of the designs adopt the "functional style", and the use of each building is expressed in bold lines. In terms of color, the three bright and eye-catching colors of blue, red, and yellow are used. The exterior of larger buildings is mostly built with colored walls. There is a central point in the meeting where you can overlook the entire venue. There are two types of</p>
<p>unique buildings: one is a luminous sphere with a diameter of 200 feet, supported by water columns shot from the pool below; the other is a spire up to 700 feet high. All 17 miles of streets, 34 miles of pedestrian walkways, and eight major areas in the venue are centered on this point and spread out in all directions. Each major area has a different color tone, and the color becomes thicker the farther it is from the center of the venue, so visitors can determine their location based on the color of the surrounding buildings. Visitors can also take a moving ladder into the interior of the luminous sphere and climb the two slowly rotating platforms inside,</p>
<p>the city of tomorrow arranged there. You can have a rough idea of ​​the future industrial city situation and see its dawn, dusk and different scenes at night. Beautiful pictures are engraved on the top, showing the progress of mankind and civilization, and you can listen to the singing of more than a thousand people. The largest building in the meeting should be the</p>
<p>Road Building, where the "Scottish Coronation" locomotive that once ran in the United States will be lined up. Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Switzerland, and Italy have also brought the latest model trains for exhibition at the meeting. There is a</p>
<p>circular theater in the building that can accommodate 4,000 people and will perform the transportation history of the United States from the carriage era of the past to the streamline locomotive of today. The automobile manufacturing companies have spared no expense to collect the most amazing exhibits. It is said that a certain company has spent 10 million yuan on construction alone, and the area occupied is only 300,000 square feet. However, there is no doubt that this house is one of the giants in the venue. It was designed by the famous theater architect Zidis and built a very vivid prototype, named "The Great Road and Horizon of Tomorrow", which is one-third of a mile long. Visitors can sit on moving chairs and see the future of the highway system. Another</p>
<p>A large automobile company built an elevated highway more than half a mile long, surrounding the building. Visitors will be on this road and have a panoramic view of the entire venue. There are four major buildings in the center of the transportation area: automobiles, railways, aviation, and navy. On both sides of the entrance to the Navy Great Summer, there are realistic ship bows built. The names of the other districts are "Government", "Production", "Distribution", "Transportation", "Commercial System", "Food", "Clothing Decoration" and "Public Interests", all of which are distributed on all sides from the center of the venue. In addition, there is the main avenue in the venue, named "Constitutional Avenue", which starts from the center of the venue and goes straight to the International Lake in front of the Federal Building, which is half a mile long. Next Sunday, President Roosevelt will deliver his opening speech on the stone steps of the building. On both wings of the Federal Building are</p>
<p>two international halls, including many small houses, which are the exhibition halls of the sixty-two countries. Only six countries have built their own pavilions. Among them, the British one is the most magnificent, with a magnificent bronze gate leading to the two halls of "Glory" and "Achievements". In addition, there are metal halls, displaying exhibits related to engineering, civil halls, and a theater. Canada also has its own building, displaying its mineral, agricultural, and forestry products. The Irish architecture mainly uses glass and metal as materials. Australia, New Silun, and South Rhodesia Island also occupy a place in the International Hall. The total investment of foreign governments is about</p>
<p>25 million yuan. There are restaurants from twenty-four countries in the foreign area, which can accommodate 43,000 diners. The most valuable building in the meeting, in terms of its content, should be the 500 famous paintings exhibited in the art gallery, with a total value of 30 million yuan; the gems exhibited in the treasure display hall are also worth 5 million yuan. It is said that many magnificent buildings in the venue will only have two places that will last forever: one is the New York Building, because the mayor intends to keep it for the city hall this summer, and it may be changed to a second</p>
<p>Medison Park in the future; the other is a water circular theater in Fountain Lake that can accommodate 10,000 people. During the meeting, Ms. Holm, the former world sports swimming champion, and others will perform amazing water skills every day, and various beautiful fireworks will be set off there at night. The entertainment area in the meeting covers an area of ​​280 acres. The other parts of the venue are closed at 10 o'clock every night, and this area will be extended to 2 o'clock in the morning. There are various fascinating creative amusement, and another area is designated as a</p>
<p>children's playground. According to current estimates, the average cost per person for visitors from outside New York is 100 yuan, which will cost approximately 150 million yuan. The distribution of its uses is as follows: entertainment 32.5 million yuan, food and drink 32.5 million yuan, accommodation 30 million yuan, shopping 20 million yuan, city transportation 15 million yuan, personnel 7.5 million yuan, transportation 1.5 million yuan; however, the authorities also give visitors various preferential treatments. For example, those who want to visit the exhibitions in New York and San Francisco will have special fare reductions. The railway company also announced a special round-trip fare for those who visit the two meetings, and stipulated that the round-trip fare around the United States for a week will only cost 90 yuan, and the public bus will be even cheaper at 70 yuan (Reuters 16 New York electric).</p>
<h3 id="e96">"Public Affairs" and "Private Friendship" <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>There is probably no need for the author to explain in detail the two terms "public affairs" and "private friendship". Readers can understand them clearly. The so-called "public affairs" specifically refers to the duties performed by general state government public institutions and public groups such as foreign firms, banks, merchants, and shops; therefore, in fact, we can also call "public affairs" "public duties". The so-called "private friendship" naturally refers to matters related to individuals in general or private feelings. Directly from the words of these two terms, we should know that "public affairs" and "private friendship" are two completely different things. We cannot use "public affairs" to discuss "private friendship", nor can we use "private friendship" to discuss "public affairs".</p>
<p>When we are "handling public affairs," we must have several qualities such as caution, prudence, enthusiasm, diligence, and loyalty. Especially people who are generally called "civil servants," they embody the spirit of the country and inspire all their spirit. At the very least, they should fulfill their responsibilities and everything they should do. Therefore, it can also be said that we must have a concept of "serving the public" and "sacrificing for the public" for "public affairs."</p>
<p>Here, please don't misunderstand. We don't need loyalty or enthusiasm for "private friendship." However, in fact, if we are a little careless with "private friendship," it really doesn't matter much, because the influence of "private friendship" is limited to the scope of private individuals. Conversely, if we are casual about "public affairs," then it will not only affect individuals, but also easily affect a large group of "the public." Therefore, we would rather use the methods and thoughts of "handling public affairs" to deal with "private friendship," but we must never use the feelings of "private friendship" to deal with "public affairs." However, in fact, there are countless people who ignore the true meaning of these few sentences and often combine "public affairs" and "private friendship." They will say: "Don't you even give me this face? To hell with 'public affairs' or not, you should help me with this one favor!" And the so-called "civil servants" will also answer with answers like "What's the matter!" So, in this situation, the larger ones succeed in actions that mislead the country and the people, and the smaller ones have evil things such as theft, robbery, and embezzlement... In short, people in general value "private friendship" too much, and shatter the dignity of "public affairs" into pieces.</p>
<p>Now, I want to point out that these habits of "private friendship" and "public affairs" are not acceptable: especially when our motherland is in a difficult career, may I ask, should we neglect "public affairs" for the sake of some face relationship, and cause great harm to the general public? Therefore, here, I sincerely hope that every Chinese national can extensively promote the spirit of "sacrificing for the public." We must know that today is not a time to value "feelings" or "private friendship." We should focus on "public affairs", work for "the public" and for "the country", and earnestly do some work in the war of resistance!</p>
<h3 id="e97">"A Decisive Battle" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mei</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has now lasted twenty-one months. Although Japan has relied on the superiority of its military equipment to achieve victories in form, it has only gained a few lines of communication and a few cities. Vast areas of land are still in the hands of the Chinese army, and the front line is unusually long and scattered. This violates the military taboo of deep incursions. If a full-scale counter-offensive is launched, and all areas are ambushed, communication will be cut off, the head and tail cannot support each other, it will inevitably lead to the result of collapse. However, when Japan launched the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, it originally wanted to gain some small advantages, but it never expected to receive the most fatal retaliation of "long-term resistance." As the war has progressed to the present, it has sunk deeper and deeper into the mire, and its predicament is fully exposed. Its regular army, reserve army, and Korean and Taiwanese troops have all been deployed to the front lines to fight, and it still feels that it is not enough. In its own "royal paradise," it keeps running into Chinese troops, gaining this piece and losing that piece, becoming dizzy and exhausted. It can be seen that the collapse of the Japanese army is not far away. We can get stronger proof from the following telegram.</p>
<p>According to a recent report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, Major General Sakura Yoshi, commander of the Japanese army in Central China, declared: "Please let the Chinese government send elite troops to the Central Plains for a decisive battle, and stop scurrying around, losing national dignity."</p>
<p>Major General Sakura Yoshi's declaration coincides with the words of Ando, commander of the Japanese army in South China, on December 19 last year, "I wish Chairman Chiang would come to Guangdong as a soldier for a final battle." They echo each other, showing that they have reached a dead end and are not far from collapse!</p>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Japanese Daily once said that after General Joffre was defeated in Belgium during the European War, he retreated completely and eventually achieved an unprecedented victory on the Marne River. This is an accurate and irrefutable argument. The victories of the counter-offensive in various parts of Central China in the past few days are like breaking bamboo. This is the prelude to the transformation from defeat to victory in the second stage of the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>From this, we know that Sakura Yoshi's declaration is nothing more than a wail before collapse.</p>
<h3 id="e98">After the Rain, the Sky Clears <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, Playing a Part? Should We Go or Stop? Home is Everywhere</p>
<p>When Zhu Ai-ren received Wu Junsu's phone call, she discussed with the two Miss He's, should we go or not? When they were appraising things in Suzhou, Wu Junsu had already made an appointment, and they had promised her, "We will definitely come! We will definitely come!" How can they say they won't go now? Moreover, He Liyu and the others also liked to watch school plays. When they were in America, they had also acted in school. Zhu Ai-ren was really busy with medical affairs and had no time for this, but it wasn't that she didn't like entertainment. Their original plan was to go to Freedom Village on Sunday morning. Wu Junsu's call was about a play on Saturday night. Saturday night was originally for rest and entertainment, and wouldn't interfere with work. But after watching the play, would they return to Anle Town late at night? Wu Junsu would definitely keep them there and not let them return. When asked, Wu Junsu indeed said on the phone: "Everything is prepared for you. If you don't mind the neglect, just stay at my place. Moreover, I have already invited Sister Yun. She is also staying here with me. We can have a long night's talk. I hope you come earlier and have dinner at my place. After dinner, we can go to the play." She had made such an arrangement on the phone, it seemed that they couldn't refuse. They calculated that they could only arrive in Suzhou on Saturday afternoon and stay at Wu Junsu's place. Then, on Sunday, they could go from Suzhou to Freedom Village, which wouldn't be a problem. So, they agreed to Wu Junsu that they would definitely come on Saturday afternoon. Wu Junsu was of course happy and urged them to come for dinner and not be too late. The next day was Saturday. Zhu Ai-ren finished the day's work at the hospital. At about four o'clock in the afternoon, they still took Zhu Ai-ren's car and came to Soochow University in Suzhou. When they arrived in Suzhou, it was still early, but the setting sun was already hanging over the treetops. They found Wu Junsu's residence. It turned out that Wu Junsu's family all lived in Shanghai, but she lived near the school alone. Because many small Western-style houses were built around Soochow University. These small Western-style houses all had gardens. The school had built these houses for the faculty to live in. The houses were three stories high, not very large, but comfortable enough for a small family to live in. People who worked at Soochow University, some rented a house together, and some occupied a house alone. Although they also charged them some rent, it was very low, almost only half price. All the equipment was also very complete, such as electric lights, telephones, water pipes, radiators, etc., everything was available. This was the school's preferential treatment for these teachers.

<h3 id="e99">The Upside-Down Theater: A Changing Profession for Actors (Part 1) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Nanqiang Beidiaoren</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A restless horse changes professions ten times." Another saying goes, "Every profession produces a champion." The change of profession I am talking about is not about people in the Peking opera world abandoning acting and engaging in other industries, but about changing roles within the sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown) roles in the acting world. I will not talk about those who have gone far, but will pick a few who are currently in the limelight to talk about.</p>
<p>Li Guichun, formerly called Xiao Dazi, originally sang Qinqiang laosheng (old male role). Because he had been singing bangzi (clapper opera) for half his life and couldn't sing it well, he changed to erhuang (a type of opera aria). He was proficient in both civil and military roles, but because he was too rough, he was not valued by connoisseurs.</p>
<p>Bai Yukun started as a wudan (female martial role), with the stage name Xiao Jiangzhou. Later, he changed to wusheng (male martial role). His spear skills had traces of his wudan training. Later, he also sang laosheng arias.</p>
<p>Han Jinkui, currently the backstage manager of the Golden Grand Theater, is a disciple of Zhang Guotai. He started as a heitou (painted-face male role), called Xiao Jinkui. After his voice broke, he changed to xiaochou (clown role) and changed his name to the current one.</p>
<p>Wu Guifen, currently the backstage director of the Xiao Guang Sai Theater, is a disciple of Dong Dechun (i.e., Dong Zhiyang's father). He started as a xusheng (bearded male role), named Wu Yuqing, with the stage name Xiao Guifen. Later, he changed to wusheng, but was not popular. He then changed back to laosheng and now also plays laodan (old female role) and xiaochou.</p>
<p>Cai Shusen, formerly named Xiao Yifang, sang xusheng arias. After his voice broke, he went north and joined the Fu Liancheng troupe, changing to wusheng. He was known for his performance in "The Leopard of Money." Recently, he has been proficient in both civil and military roles, but he doesn't perform many wusheng plays, and is still known for his aria plays and hongsheng (red-faced male role) plays.</p>
<p>Liu Kunrong used to be a bangzi huadan (female role), called Bai Xuanfeng. Later, he changed to wusheng, then xusheng, and then xiaosheng (young male role) and hualian (painted-face role). He is currently with the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Mao Yunke originally sang laosheng, and also played xiaosheng and hualian. Later, he played huadan (female role), wusheng, and laodan. Recently, as he has gotten older, he has returned to playing male roles.</p>
<p>Zhao Junyu started as a xusheng and also played huamian (painted-face). He was called Da Da Kuiguan. After his voice broke, he changed to wusheng, then xiaosheng and qingyi (serious female role) and huadan. Although he is now playing female roles, he still plays xiaosheng roles. He recently performed in Kunming with Zhao Ruquan.</p>
<p>Li Qinxian is a famous modern teacher, also named Qin Xuan. He is a disciple of Lü Yueqiao. He sang heitou under the name "Hai'er Hong." After his voice broke, he learned qingyi from Wu Yuehua. Now, because of his age, he makes a living by teaching students.</p>
<p>Wang Heyun is currently with the Grand Theater. He originally learned wudan and later changed to wu jing (martial painted-face role).</p>
<p>Ni Jinli originally learned xiaosheng. His fan skills were quite impressive. Later, he changed to wu jing and is now with the Tianchan Theater.</p>
<p>He Runchu, a disciple of Shao Jizhou, studied with the famous amateur actor Xu Heizhen. He originally sang xusheng with his brother He Yixin (i.e., the father of He Yurong, the female xusheng actress at the Great World Qiankun Theater, who is now deceased). Later, he changed to laodan and was taught by Ren Changhai. He has been with the Grand Theater for a long time.</p>
<p>Yao Yufu originally sang xusheng and later changed to huashan (female role). People only know that he was Mei Lanfang's long-time partner, but who knows that he started as a laosheng? He is now in the old capital.</p>
<p>Xiao Yang Yuelou originally sang xusheng, known for "Li Ling's Monument" and "Wenzhao Pass." After his voice broke, he changed to huadan.</p>
<p>Liu Zhenting originally sang erhuang huadan, stage name Zijin Xian, and was the son-in-law of the famous painted-face actor Liu Yongchun. Later, he changed to xusheng, then gradually changed to xiaosheng and laodan. Zhao Ruquan recruited him for the continuous performance of "The Case of Peng Gong" at the Samsung Stage, and changed his name to the current one. He is now with the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Wang Fengqing originally sang xiaosheng and later changed to xusheng, following the Gui Fen style. He is now living in the old capital and rarely performs on stage due to his age.</p>

<p>— Yanran</p>
<p>In "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat," in addition to implying the snobbery of the social environment and the difficulty of making a living, its gags are also very capable of making the general audience laugh until their stomachs hurt.</p>
<p>For example, when Mr. Wang was teaching at a girls' middle school, he actually read aloud the "Classic of Filial Piety for Women" and recited the "Three Obediences and Four Virtues for Women: at home, obey your father; when married, obey your husband; when your husband dies, obey your son..." The rotten tune actually put all the girls in the classroom to sleep. When the principal came in, he woke up as if from a dream and realized that the students had all fallen asleep. This shows that education must grasp the needs of the times in order to arouse students' interest.</p>
<p>In the scene where Mr. Wang has difficulty making a living and wants to commit suicide, he hangs a rope from the beam, then puts it under his chin, kicks away the stool under his feet, and makes various poses while his body is swaying in the air. In this scene, the audience really burst into laughter.</p>
<p>In the face of utter despair, Mr. Wang suddenly receives a letter from his friend Xiao Chen, introducing him to be the secretary of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. This really made him extremely happy. He even jumped up and down in the room with laughter, jumping around several times, and constantly singing ditties in his mouth. The vivid expression truly described the joy of an unemployed person once he gets a job.</p>
<p>When he walked into the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the usher was initially snobbish, then respectful, and finally, because he lost his letter of introduction and could not produce any real evidence, he showed a snobbish face again and tried to drive him out. This back-and-forth performance thoroughly exposed the snobbery of people's hearts and the fickleness of the world. While we can't help but laugh, we should also regard it as social philosophy.</p>
<p>Throughout the play, Tang Jie's portrayal of Mr. Wang can be said to be the most energetic. You Guangzhao's portrayal of the usher is also just right, full of humor. The expressions of the other actors can also be said to be quite successful.</p>
<p>In short, we should not only regard this film as a humorous film, but sometimes also as a social film. Because it really contains a lot of life philosophy and worldly experience.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang (Tang Jie) said: "Screenwriter, director, and leading actor, I do it all! People say I have 'a way to make money.' Heavens! Actually, it's 'hard to eat!'"</p>

<h3 id="e101">After Hu Guang's Plea, the "Mulan Joins the Army" Negotiation is Resolved <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>

<p>Moving to the New Light Theater Starting on the 21st</p>
<p>MGM Once Sent a Letter of Ultimatum to Hu Guang</p>
<p>The Hua Cheng Film Studio and the Hu Guang Grand Theater recently had a sudden negotiation. The reason was that Hua Cheng's debut work, "Mulan Joins the Army," was still selling more than 2,200 yuan per day. The contract between Hua Cheng and Hu Guang stated that the film could only be withdrawn and stopped showing if the daily ticket sales were less than 1,000 yuan. However, Hu Guang also had a contract with MGM. Because "Mulan Joins the Army" had been showing for more than two months, MGM's films had been piling up since coming down from the Da Guangming Theater, with six or seven films in stock, resulting in no small losses. Recently, MGM even sent a letter of ultimatum to Hu Guang, stating that if MGM's films were not scheduled quickly, then in addition to tearing up the contract, Hu Guang would have to compensate for a loss of 60,000 yuan. As a result, the Hu Guang authorities felt very difficult and had to shorten the showing period of "Mulan Joins the Army," scheduled to end on the 20th, and at the same time published farewell commemorative words in the advertisement. Hua Cheng believed that Hu Guang had violated the contract because it was not yet time to withdraw the film according to the contract, so it filed a negotiation with Hu Guang and published a warning in the newspaper. Hu Guang found it difficult to resolve this, so it specially consulted with the Hua Cheng authorities. It is said that as a result of Hu Guang's sincere plea, Hua Cheng, taking into account Hu Guang's predicament, had accepted Hu Guang's request. "Mulan Joins the Army" was decided to be shown until the 20th, and starting on the 21st, it would be screened at the New Light Grand Theater, thus bringing the negotiation to a conclusion. As a result, Hu Guang also scheduled to change to Western films starting on the 20th? The first film is "Sweethearts" starring Jeanette MacDonald.</p>
<p>The New Light Grand Theater has recently been showing the humorous film "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat," directed and starring Tang Jie, which has been selling very well. However, because "Mulan Joins the Army" is coming, it has to "give way" temporarily and re-screen "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" after "Mulan Joins the Army" has finished showing. Some people say: This is "Hua Mulan eating Mr. Pang Wang." One</p>

<p>The 34th installment of "Journey to the West" at the Xin Ji Grand Theater has been started by Zhang Baiyun. The other day, backstage manager Liu Kunrong, Zhang Yipeng, Liu Zhenting, Liu Fenghai and others held a big meeting to discuss the plot.</p>
<p>◇ The famous painted-face actor Li Kechang went to the Great World with friends the other night and visited Zhang Luo, Wang Daigong and other old friends backstage at the Lianyou Society. He said that he had not returned to his hometown for three years and planned to resign from the Golden Theater and return north.</p>
<p>◇ Gu Wuwei is scheduled to return to Hong Kong today. According to him, he may go to Chongqing, otherwise he may resume film work.</p>
<p>◇ The clown Yang Yushan, due to being stimulated, became mentally disordered and left a note and ran away. Now Yang Jingren has found him on Danshui Road. He had tried to commit suicide and was saved by someone. He was fortunate to be reborn. This drastic measure was caused by worries about the times.</p>
<p>◇ Chen Dabei's "Pipa Record" has been more than half filmed by Xinhua Company. Now Chen is writing a complete "Xi Shi," with Yuan Meiyun designated to play Xi Shi and Jin Yan to play Fan Li, with extremely grand scenes.</p>
<p>◇ The Lianyou Drama Society's public performance of "Inevitably Affectionate" by He Jinglu has been very popular with the audience. Now He Jun will continue to arrange the second installment, but change the name of the play to "The Death of an Actress," the plot of which is more tense and moving than "Inevitably Affectionate."</p>
<h3 id="e103">"Mysterious Lady": A Unique Style <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In the past, Zheng Zhengqiu's "Sister Flowers" was continuously screened at the New Light Theater for dozens of days and did not decline. Filmmakers gathered to study it. At that time, many "bitter films" were successively released, but scarcity makes the heart grow fonder. When there are too many things, the audience also feels bored. This is exactly the same as the current costume films. After the war, due to the difficulty of finding material, domestic films had to lean towards historical dramas and stage plays, which gradually made the audience feel bitter. We believe that if we want to improve domestic films, we should abandon the consistent style to the extreme. If "Shadow City Record" is known for its new style and is praised by movie fans, then the new film "Mysterious Lady," according to writer-director Wen Yimin, is a unique work of recent times, and the whole play is full of emotion and the performance is quite desolate. We are tired of seeing old tricks, and we have a deeper expectation for this "Mysterious Lady." It is also said that the film will be released soon.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>A Textual Research on the Plot of "Four Jinshi"</p>
<p>Several days ago, I received a letter from a reader asking me to write a simple explanation of the story of each play so that readers can be more easily interested. He said that most of our country's plays are based on "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The States of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty," "Water Margin," "The Case of Peng Gong," "The Little Five Righteous Men," and other novels. The above books are all well known, so there is no need to explain them. If the "Four Jinshi" has too many characters on stage and the plot is very complicated, those who are familiar with this play can certainly understand the whole story, but for the sake of readers who do not often set foot in the theater, I will briefly describe the story of the play so that they can understand the meaning of this article. In the future, if I encounter similar plots, I will also describe their outlines.</p>
<p>During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, there were four jinshi (successful candidates in the highest imperial examinations) named Mao, Gu, Tian, and Liu, all of whom were on the same list. At that time, Yan Song monopolized power, and they had not been sent out to serve as officials for a long time. So they went to Shuangta Temple to swear an oath before Emperor Wenchang, vowing to be honest and upright officials. Later, they were recommended by their teacher Hai Rui, and they were successively sent out to serve as officials. Liu was appointed as the magistrate of Shangcai County, Henan Province, and Gu Du was appointed as the commissioner of Ruguang Road, Henan Province, and concurrently managed the main hall of Xinyang Prefecture. Mao Peng was specially appointed as the inspector of Henan Province, but Tian Lun, although he was also appointed as the inspector of Jiangxi Province, had not yet received his credentials to take office, so he lived alone in his hometown. At that time, there was a wealthy household named Yao Tingchun in Shangcai County, whose wife, née Tian, was unusually fierce. Tian was the elder sister of the jinshi Tian. Because she was angry that her parents-in-law favored her nephew Tingmei, she plotted to poison Tingmei and tricked his sister-in-law Yang Suzhen into selling herself as a wife to Yang Chun, a foreigner. Yang learned the whole story and acted righteously to help Suzhen avenge her grievances and became sworn siblings. At that time, Inspector Mao happened to be passing through Liulin disguised as a fortune teller, so he wrote a petition for Suzhen and told her to appeal to a higher court, because Mao knew that Magistrate Liu would be partial to Tian because of their fellow student relationship. The two siblings planned to go to the Ruguang Road court together to file a complaint, but they were separated on the way. Suzhen was fortunate enough to be rescued by Song Shijie, who adopted her as his goddaughter. Song was a famous litigator, so he went to the Road court to appeal. Gu Du was quite honest and upright at first, but later he received a secret letter from Tian Lun asking for his help. Although he wanted to refuse, the three hundred taels of silver in the letter was taken away by his secretary. Since Gu had no money to return, he suddenly changed his original intention and made a wrongful judgment, scolding Shijie in the court and throwing Suzhen into prison. Unexpectedly, Shijie had learned the truth about Tian and Gu's bribery from the secret letter brought by the scribe in his inn the day before, and had secretly recorded the words in the letter on his clothes. Now that he saw Gu suddenly overturned the previous case, he knew that he had been bribed, so he appealed again to Inspector Mao. At this point, the evidence was complete, and Mao sentenced the three jinshi Tian, Gu, and Liu, and née Tian, to death.</p>
