<h3>美總統對歐局之呼籲</h3>
<p>「挽將倒之狂瀾，爲和平之砥柱，」夫何等氣概，何等力量，何等艱鉅，何等功德？然何足以形容美國總統羅斯福氏隔昨所發電文所期待之偉大收穫。蓋有數千萬血肉之軀，理智之倫，將犧牲於無情之砲火之下；有數千萬萬資產物力，將化爲烟雲，將成爲灰燼；更緣是而間接喪其幸福喪其生活，喪其生命者，不可估計焉。實逼處此，禍在目前，舉世惶惶者非朝夕矣。或未以爲然，徒以其尙未然；非有理由，非有保障，得謂必不然。試一思之：竟有人焉、因緣時會，扶植權威，而將人類數千年來涵養造就之文明基本原則，如自由公道仁恕信義等等，不惟捐棄之如敝屣，抑且摧毀之不遺餘力；嫉視他國之保持文明原則，企圖脅迫之盲目以從已；藉口於種族觀念以擴展其勢力，同時以暴力兼併異族；以外交談判爲不中用之方式，而以武力爲解決國際問題，貫徹一己欲念之不二法門；輕作諾言，等諸廢話；憎惡條約，視爲桎梏；以要挾爲正當願望，以侵略爲正當權利；整軍經武，耀武揚威；夫如是而謂無傷於人類和平，國際秩序，終得相安而不至交戰者，誰能信之。大勢所示，開戰祗是時日問題，而近頃之事變，尤昭示時日無可多延，戰禍即在目前。彼競張軍備，山及岌唯恐不及，是固彰明較著之開戰前奏曲；而軍隊集中，艦隊游弋，常備兵倍增，後備兵入伍，邊疆趕築障礙物，軍區宣布戒嚴令；凡此動態，則盤馬彎弓，引滿待發，旣對壘於咫尺之間，去交綏一霎那而已。誠非美總統之發電呼籲，莫信猶有避免大刼之絲毫希望也。</p>
<p>羅斯福氏致德國元首希特勒·義國首相墨索里尼之電文，昨今兩日報紙旣揭布其內容；以悲天憫人之懷抱，作止戈息戰之呼籲；至今日爲止，雖視爲有史以來，有關最多數人，在最大危機中之福音可也。彼論侵略之狀態，謂歐洲方面已有三國喪失獨立，菲洲方面亦有一國喪失獨立，遠東方面且有一獨立國家之廣大土地爲其鄰邦所佔據，又據傳聞，尙有某某獨立國，有遭受侵略之虞。彼論戰爭之結果，謂不間其爲戰勝國戰敗國中立國，均將感受痛苦，影響且及於世界各國之後一代。彼論戰爭之是非，僅稱頌爲保衛國土而抗戰：此外，斷言於絕無理由，政家乃得以驅使人民作戰爲權利。彼質問德義，可吾提供不予攻擊之保證，列舉對象三十國，希望時期自十年乃至二十五年。彼所以安慰德義者，在和平空氣之下，商討限制軍備與促進貿易兩問題。其結論則以為當前禍福之機樞，實繫於各國當局；而他日釀成戰禍之責任，無逃於歷史褒貶。眞知灼見，至理名言，鞭辟入裏，氣象萬千；而聲言其動機之不以私念，不以怯弱，尤使美國無量偉大之精神與物力，不惟有足橫斷大西洋之觀，抑且充溢寰宇矣。</p>
<p>雖然，羅斯福氏乃至文明人類，所期待於此電之收穫，所希望於大刧之避免，固可得乎？至今日爲止，此電洵爲最大福音，顧其價値止於時代之文獻，抑有其客觀之功能乎？據昨日華盛頓電傳，美國政府並不十分樂觀；且爲防患未然，旣作必要措置；同時，在大西洋演習之艦隊，即將駛回太平洋。此則記者未欲以此推論美國對於發此呼籲之自信，但歐局嚴重之程度於此更可覘知。至於德義兩國，爲歐局嚴重之主角，誠使接納善言，幡然改圖，自足使嚴重之歐局急轉直下；然至記者握管時爲止，祗聞德義人士冷酷之反唇相譏，似於羅斯福氏之苦心孤詣，不稍理會，前途未可樂觀，此其一證；而德義當局則尚無正式表示，其意態究竟如何，未可逆覩；謂彼反應適如所期待所希望之反，要亦非意外也。</p>
<p>我人自任何觀點言之，俱望德義勒馬懸崖，更能善用羅斯福氏之呼籲，取爲軍事轉變至於外交之坦途。蓋局勢激盪至今日，去開戰僅一霎那，亦即改遵外交坦途之最後一霎那；舍此不圖，戰禍立至。所可憂穎者：以希特勒與墨索里尼二氏歷來應付國際之作風，及其鼓勵人民之政策，殆亦有其政治上之原因。未能容許轉變之若銳角；不轉變而一意孤行，則不惟歐陸之英法軸心漸具規模，即美國輿情亦且以其總統呼籲之無效而更同情於英法。於是言之，羅斯福氏此電，無論其動機之咬潔，無可懷疑，然其可能之結果，一面有爲歐局倒挽在瀾，砥柱和平之希望，美國誠是所自命之「居間人」；一面或因德義之固執而促使民治集團增强擴大，而美國之遽成個中人，乃極迅速而必然之趨歸也。</p>

<h3>英國朝野　評論一斑</h3>
<p>挽回戰禍闢一蹊徑英仍不能疏於防範</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日英國各　對於羅斯福總統所致希特勒及墨索里尼之有歷史性的電文、均用特大鉛字登載、於此可見英國對於羅總統干預歐洲事務之重視、然昨晚所引起之種種希望、旋因柏林方面傳來德官方對於羅總統之建議、均處以冷淡之消息、致爲之减弱、各國對於美國下令大西洋美艦隊各艦立即駛往太平洋之消息、均刋登於較羅總統致希墨兩氏電文次要之地位、星期日觀察報今日載有社論、內稱、本世紀中已兩度聆得對自由之重大挑戰、而均發源於中歐、而均於分隔美歐兩洲之三千哩外發出同樣之感化力、星期日泰晤士報社論、謂全世界今均殷切以待希特勒與墨索里尼之覆電、但有人或謂兩人與其作絕對不欲遵守之空諾、不如不覆之爲愈、星期日捷報謂、羅總統之電文可列爲歷史上個人爲其同胞効勞最大者之一、星期日快報表示意見、謂希墨兩氏如拒絕羅總統之呼籲、則料美國將修正中立法、而利於受侵略國、星期日觀察報又載加文氏所著一文、謂目前之大局、其嚴重幾與去年九月危機相垺、如吾人在後此數星期中能善自佈置、則或許呼吸和平空氣至長久時期、惟今無一人敢言後數星期中變化若何、遏止大難之最佳方法、厥爲準備應付、使之顯明、俾敢犯大不韙者皆能覩之、又謂吾人必欲特殊防彼方突然攫奪要害地點之危險、無論在東在西、或出以他種武裝暴力行動皆然云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政界耆宿勞合喬治、對於羅斯福總統向各獨裁主義者呼籲之電文、稱之爲「一種理智上莊嚴重大之呼籲、」反對黨領袖阿特里亦稱之爲「有價値之創舉、」觀於二氏之意見、即可表示英國全國人民傾心贊許之一斑、各報評論家對於羅總統電文內率直之言論、如「君等會一再申明君等及貴國人民均不願戰爭、此說果確、則自無戰爭之需要」云、皆備致讀揚、許之爲對不攻自破事實之簡潔的表示、此外更注意於羅總統電文內之一段、該段文字係力言人民均願望彼等所懐之恐懼、將可終止、惟不幸須有認識各項新事實之必要、歐洲三國及非洲一國業已喪失獨立、且吿滅亡、遠東另一獨立國亦巳有廣大領土、被其鄰邦所佔據、吾人所信爲不確之消息、皆堅持現尙計劃對於其他獨立國家、繼續作使略行爲云云、故世界現正趨向一種危險之時期、除非獨有一種更合理之途徑、爲各事之南針、則局勢必將終成災難而後巳、茲於發表此項宣言之時、鄭重聲明　國人民並非因自私或自葸而發言、實係具有人類勢力及友誼之力量、國際問題得在會議席上予以解決、惟會議塲中、與法庭無殊、如期兩造同獲實在利益、則討論必須出於至誠、羅總統又於說明美國因未牽入立時之爭執、願作友誼之調停、後發問曰、「君等願否担保貴國之軍隊、將不攻擊或侵略下列各獨立國家之領土或屬地乎」（十六路透）</p>
<h3>德國態度冷淡</h3>
<p>希特勒詳細研究電文並與義省相交換意見</p>
<p>（柏林）美總統發來之電文、已立即轉致慕尼黑、呈希特勒披閱、外長里賓特羅甫與德政府其他要員、刻皆在慕尼黑、來電正在研究中、大的希特勒將先與墨索里尼接洽而後作覆、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）希特勒與里賓特雜甫今日午後皆抵慕尼黑、聞現正會商美總統之來電、翻譯人員工作頗忙、將來電全文譯成德文、至晚方竣事、官塲對此不發任何批評、且不允作來電全文將否公布之表示、星期日晨報未載關於美總統來電之消息、但許多德人因聆英國對外廣播之新聞、已悉此事、德國將佔領但澤之謠言、究竟有無根據、現無可恃消息、目前留駐柏林之要人僅宣傳部長戈培爾一人耳、據路透社所聞、美總統之電文未曾引起過分之驚訝、因官塲稱、慕尼黑旣不召集會議、亦無特殊之活動、今夜且不擬發表關於美總統來電之公報、聞希特勒在星期二日以前未必遄返柏林、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據可靠報告、希特勒對於羅斯福總統之籲請、保證在十年之內、互不侵犯、以尊重歐洲及近東領土完整之議、已決定予以抗拒、聞此一決定、係在希特勒及德外長里賓特洛甫會商之後始行發出者、又希特勒氏、會用電話與義相墨索里尼討論一切、預料德義兩國行將對美和平計劃、採取同一態度、國社黨方面報稱希特勒或不致於正式拒絕美總統之建議、僅置之不理而已、宣傳部對於元首已拒絕此種建議之報吿、則不肯予以證實、但承認德方確有拒絕之可能、（十六日美聯電）</p>
<h3>威爾遜十四原則　德人猶未能忘懷</h3>
<p>（柏林）美國總統羅斯福電達希特勒元首之後、此間政界人士咸皆淡然處之、幷作滑稽之語云、此項電文顯已誤投、關於舉行圓桌會議一項方式、德國早巳獲有經騐、直至放樂此種方式之後、始有此日之强盛、又况美國已故總統威爾遜前所提出之十四項原別、實效如何、德國方面迄未能忘懐、此際若果舉行圓桌會議、則各國所當討論之問題旣多、覓致解決方案爲事實亦困難、加以某種理論問題（按此乃指布爾希維克主義而言）極爲尖銳、德國亦未便以同等地位、與理論懸殊之人同桌議事、但德國負責人士在希特勒元首與義相墨索里尼交換意見之前、拒不表示意見、僅謂此事需在外交上進行重要談判云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>反共立場終不變指電文顯屬誤投</h3>
<p>（柏林）美國總統羅斯福來電內容如何、德意志通訊社頃於本日晚間十時二十分摘要發稿、其詞甚短、半官機關德意志通信則加以駁斥云、「羅斯福總統乃以威爾遜故總統自居、原屬常情、渠之慣技、不外刺激其他民族使之感覺不安、然後以和平使者自命、質言之、渠欲於引起世界恐慌之後、主張恢復人類幸福、而於釀成戰爭心理之後、昌言和平、揆其用意殆欲移轉世人視錢於各全能國、俾克掩飾各民治國充滿仇恨之宣傳運動、並因某某國所推行之包圍政策業已引起反響、乃欲有以消釋之、吾人本諸已往經騐、對於美國總統此種政治行動、表示懐疑、又安足怪、至於召集圓桌會議、設法滿足某一偉大民族生存攸關之需要一層、亦足引起悲慘的局面、則以各種根本的問題、未能純就法律觀點加以討論故也、此外尙有一點、已爲羅斯福總統所忽視、即主義的鬥爭是也、茲有一種國際性的破壊力量、欲陷各民族於流血的紛擾、而以威脅加諸全世界秩序、此種力量若一日日聽其以某一國爲護符、從而穩定其地位、換言之、布爾希維克主義若一日聽其在世界政局中享有平等的權利、則國際間即一日未能樹立持久而又圓滿的局勢、所謂圓桌會議亦無能造成新的秩序、羅斯福總統今此一電文、定係誤投德國民族之力量與智慧均已進步、決不聽任美故總統威爾遜前所獲有之勝利、重見於此日羅斯福總統所提建議、將由德國予以拒絕、殆可斷言」云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅馬方面　暫守緘默　義相與戈林密談</h3>
<p>貧窮國求　足願望</p>
<p>（羅馬）關於美國總統羅斯福所發出之電報、此間官方人士在墨索里尼首相與德國元首希特勒會同決定態度之前、拒不表示意見、耶電文亦未公佈、截至目下爲止、僅有黨政兩界領袖知之、黨方人士幷謂、無論何項動議、凡以鞏固和平爲事者、均爲義國所歡迎、但「貧窮國」之願望、一日未能滿足、則公允的和平、即一日不能見諸實際、質言之、國際問各項懸案、倘不予以解決、德義兩國之正當要求、倘不予以滿足、則羅斯福總統所主張之一般協定、亦即無從實現云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）衆信義相　索里尼對於羅斯福總統之來電、定將予以極密切之硏究、今日義相正與來游羅馬之德國航空部長戈林上將、作親密之接觸、義相於議會集會後接見戈林　談二十分鐘、並同入宮中赴義王之午宴、羅馬人士刻知美總統來電者廖廖無蔑、官塲方面對於美總統來電事、諉稱不知、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）義國政界認羅斯福總統電文、爲一種甚慷慨之舉動、惟覺在接電者未及從容考慮與答覆之時、遽將電文公布、恐不免債事耳、至少和平十年之諾言誠可動人、惟政界對於世界會議一層、覺非至義國對法要求業已饜滿之後、恐不能產生良好結果云、一般義人可無疑義的、對於義總統此舉發生美滿印象、（十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>美艦一百二十艘　奉命調回太平洋　不啻對日警吿毋輕舉妄動美對菲列濱安全深切關懷</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）昨日美當局命令美艦隊立即駛回太平洋、按此項命令、係在總統羅斯福氏向歐洲全能國家呼籲和平以後二小時中所發表者、政府之所以有此舉者，係因歐洲局勢緊張之故、認為實有集中艦隊於太平洋、以防太平洋突然發生事變之必要、所有美國之艦隊除新大西洋艦隊、巡洋艦五艘·潛水艇六艘·與航空母艦一艘外、均接奉命令「駛返太平洋通常作戰區域」、此等軍艦一俟裝足燃料、即將啟椗駛赴太平洋、又據此間觀察家指稱、英國之海軍已全部集中於歐洲海面、俾一旦戰爭爆發、即可加入作戰、又此項命令之範圍所及、共包括軍艦一百二十艘之多、據海軍方面計算各艦裝加燃料約需三日、又自東岸駛至西岸（太平洋）約需十三四日、軍艦約十六艘、仍將留大西洋沿岸、參加紐約之世界博覽會、同時諾福克之特別檢閱或仍將照常舉行、但規模不致如以往所計劃者之大、按美艦係於二月經巴拿馬運河、駛人大西洋至加里比亞海、作大規模演習、羅斯福總統亦與艦隊同往觀察、（十六日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據美聯社今日所得消息美國方面現已獲得多種情報、皆謂國際時局一旦發生劇變勢將牽涉遠東局面、而使美國之權益遭受威脅、因此美國艦隊已突然謂集於太平洋方面、據官方聲稱、歐局變動後、日本將在東印度採取與　義遙相呼應之行動、且不僅將與美國以物質上的供給以嚴重威脅、同時亦將使菲律濱之安全遭受打擊、又擄海軍界稱美國之艦隊主力、暫時仍在太平洋沿岸一帶、除少數潛水艇及以夏威夷爲根據地之少數軍艦而外、暫不開往夏戚夷之西、又據外交界方面觀察、美國海軍此决調動、係與向德義之警吿同時發生、其意義即在警吿某某等國家勿作繼續之侵略、據消息靈通方面稱、日本對於美國此項行動定必懐有戒心、蓋因日本目前之淐力、正運用於中國方面、對於他國之威脅定必無力應付、尤其美國人民對於以美國之海軍對付日</p>

<h3>平衡物價問題</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>（一）這問題應如何看法</p>
<p>雖則現在誰都感覺到物價貴得利害，可是各人都以爲這是戰時應有的現象。事實確然如此，而且中外一律。大家爲了戰時應有的現象，便都咬緊牙關忍耐，這足以反映全體國民堅苦卓絕的犧牲精神；是值得向世人自豪的。</p>
<p>不過我們決不能以其爲勢所必然，便任其所之。因爲有不少人，便在利用這種理由，操縱着物價，故意抬高。爲了國家民族的整個利益，任何人固應堅定犧牲一切的精神，但事實上我們也不能否認：物質生活上的忍耐，畢竟有一定的限度。同時更應考慮的：國民生活被高價物壓迫到不能維持的時候，對於抗戰是不會有什麼幫助的。</p>
<p>而且這問題，與其說：「目前已有切實解決的必要」。母寗說：「爲了將來的安全，現在已非先籌「防微杜漸之計不可」！因爲當前物價飛漲的主要原因：即都知道與戰事有關。那末在戰爭尚無結束希望的今後，也就在刺激物價飛漲的一切原因繼續存在的今後，勢必還有無限沸騰的危險；是無可疑義的。</p>
<p>（二）物價高漲的理由分析</p>
<p>戰爭的存在，爲什麼足以刺激物價飛漲？這理由很簡單，就拿現在的事實來說吧：</p>
<p>（一）戰前，國家的經費，最多不過八九億元左右；像民二十六年度的總概算開了空前的高紀錄，也不過十億元多些，但從戰事發生以來，因爲軍費的急速增大，據說已超過二十五億元以上，這就是說：商品的需要量幾較平時超過二倍以上，需要增加，物價當然也要增加，像上海，又因人口驟增，需要也就大增，但這不是重要的因素，因爲：</p>
<p>（二）如果需要增加的同時，生產也能同比率增加；那末物價的上升，還可依着曲綫進行，不致越漲越高，可是我們的生產事業，平時已那麼落後，戰時又被破壞到不堪一覩，不特是工業設備已殘破不堪，廣大的農民，在戰區裏也都輟耕。加以日軍的到處掠奪，更增大了物資的消耗，擴大了供需不平衡的闊度。</p>
<p>（三）國內生產激減，外加日方的掠奪，我國的出口能力於是大減特減，出口減少，便影響到國際收支平衡，加以我國的軍需品以至民需品，大都仰給海外，於是幣值的本身既感受威脅，何況日方又竭力搗亂我國的外滙，自發生外匯黑市塲以來，幣值竟跌去四折左右；幣值跌落，進口物價勢必飛漲尤烈。因此政府與民間購用外貨的貨幣担尤大。國內流通的通貨量，自然也非增加不可。</p>
<p>（四）通貨流動額增大時，如果商品的流通圓滑，那末通貨刺激物價的程度，還可在交易率的增大中消減下去。可是戰區的交通綫，又皆爲日方控制，貨運就是依賴外商，也不能應付裕如，因此供需失調的形勢更見嚴重，物價上升的勢力也就更雄健。</p>
<p>（五）在商品流通過程內，除了貨運困難之外，還有許多阻碍。日僞在戰區內沿途對物敲索，今且進而推行其所謂「貿易統制」。此外運費，保險費，和內滙匯水的增漲等等，也無不都在加強供需失調和物價漲勢的程度。</p>
<p>這許多刺激物價的壓力，都是戰爭的產物。戰事存在一天，那末上昇的可能，也就存在一天。由戰爭造成的這些高物價的苦痛，我們固可以最後勝利的收獲來抵消。可是除了這些自然理由外，還有投機，操縱，壟斷，居奇等等現象：而且這些現象對於物價上的影響，來勢更兇。在各種貨物價格內要算出投機價格所佔的地位，果然不可能。但是也可隨便舉個例來證明他在現在的物價水準裏所佔何種程度？</p>
<p>（三）物價水準裏的投機價格</p>
<p>譬如去年底至今年初，上海米的存倉數，實際並未減少。以米市季節來說，這是全年內米價最軟弱的時期，但這次却反乎常例，忽開始急漲。飛漲的理由：據說爲了日軍收買，所以上海有米荒危險。大家競爭囤購。爲防荒囤購，固無不可。但可疑的何以米價漲到十四元的限界，便不再上昇？如果真有米荒危險，即使在強有力的統制下也會發生暗市，像去年春發生米荒時　暗市一樣。而且米價漲到十四元，日軍何以不再繼續收買？如說貴了收買要吃虧，但日軍收買任何東西，都不照市價給錢。貴不貴？與收不收？根本不聯繫。後來聽說：這次米價的漲風，可當上海米商的「不平之鳴」看。因爲現在除了米價一項還和戰前相等外，其他皆已大漲特漲。</p>
<p>現在高物價的因素一是外匯關係，米價固不受這種影響，因爲他們是土產品之故。但棉花也是土產品，何以他不能像米價一樣穩定？如果說爲了需要，那末花的需要不見得比米更大？如果說因爲日僞統制和苛征，米也何曾不受同等待遇？但是現在棉花的市價，已較戰前半年平均價漲起百分之五十以上，棉價的上漲除了供需等事實原因外，大半原因實在被飛漲的紗價帶起的，試看去年一至十月，紗價是不斷上漲，棉價是漲跌互見，因此去年全年紗價平均較廿六年一至八月漲起三二·三%，而棉花價反跌二·一%，今年一月紗價，較戰前八個月平均漲五二·九%，棉價亦帶漲至四四·%，（見經濟統計月誌本年一月號第六滬表）</p>
<p>何以紗價會如是激漲？當然與前述的許多理由都有關，但投機成分更有關係。雖則從生產減少上，可以提出許多關於生產設備被燬的數字來證明，但上海畢竟是棉紗的出產地，供給總比他地容易。在流通上並無使紗價大漲的理由，而且他是國產，也無通貨影響。上海紗價向有支配全國紗價的地位。如果他的價格確屬合理，那末不能利用內地的需要便任意高價待沽。但現在都因內地紗價奇昂，上海紗價也就盡量提高，所以弄成今日越漲越貴的情形。要知利用需要來高價待沽，這正就是投機操縱的伎倆之一。</p>
<p>我們不妨再從地別上來比較，上海物價的漲勢，較內地實在還要厲害。爲了材料限制，姑以民廿六年七月及民廿七年八月比較一番：</p>
<p>上海與內地之物價指數比較（一九三七年全年平均物價爲基期）</p>
<p>民廿六年七月　民廿七年八月　增加率</p>
<p>上海　九七·四　一二七·六　三○·二</p>
<p>（廣州）九六·三　一二二·二　二五·九</p>
<p>（重慶）　一○四·二　一一三·一　八·九</p>
<p>（註）上海廣州原係一九二六年爲基準，改算以一九三七年全年平均爲基期，俾與以一九三年七爲基準之重慶指數比較如上，材料參看中國國民經濟研究所出版中外經濟年報。</p>
<p>上海在廿六年已發生戰爭，其時粵川居後方，把該年全年平均物價做基準，與以後的物價比較，照理上海應比內地的增加率爲低，但竟適得其反；像已由前方變爲後方的民廿七年八月時的上海物價，反較內地漲得利害。以內地物價昂貴爲影響上海物價的理由，顯然不能成立，且反證上海投機程度遠較各地利害。</p>
<p>（四）高物價與戰時經濟</p>
<p>依一般的說來，物價和國民的購買力是互爲因果的。物價漲，國民收入增加，因之國民購買力也隨之增加。如物價漲過國民購買力水準之上，國民消費必自然縮減；因之物價勢必隨之下降，至國民購買力相等爲止。但這以生產發達，秩序安定爲條件，並且事實上還不能十足兌現。因爲工資決無與物價同比例上昇，所以高物價只有削弱國民購買力的事實，很少有增強國民購買力的可能。試看下表：上海工廠工人的平均工資，二十七年僅較二十六年增加一·八%，但此時的工人生活費皆已增加二九·四%，這便是明顯的事實：</p>
<p>上海工人生活費及工資指數比較表</p>
<p>二十六年　二十七年</p>
<p>工人生活費指數（一）　一二四·一一　一六○·六○</p>
<p>工廠工人工資指數（二）　一○○·○○　一○一·八○</p>
<p>貨幣購買力（三）　八○·五七　六二·二七</p>
<p>（註）（一）根據國際勞工局中國分局編製數字，（二）工資指數，根據經濟統計研究所出版「經濟統計月誌」本年一月號「上海工廠工人每月平均工資表」核算而得。</p>
<p>何況我國的生產，既異常落後，現在又處於戰事破壞一切生產設備的時期。所以物價高漲，一方面是反映貨幣對外價值的跌落，他方面是加強洋貨對我國民財富的剝削力最。換句話說：足以促成我國財政，金融，幣制，以及整個國民經濟於潰亡。</p>
<p>從表面上看：買辦資本（專營推銷外貨的商人之類）和準買辦資本（如以洋貨爲原料的生產者，及其製品的販賣者等等）的收益，或許也有部份的增加：從而造成銀行存款賬面上的景氣。但既不能補償他財富資本的貨幣價值之損失，更不能補償整個國民財富上的損失。那是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>從事實上看：國內物價的高漲，現已使國民全體的生活感受酷辣的威脅，這種威脅不消滅，甚至再擴大，結果便有動搖整個社會治安的危險，更危險的將使戰爭的經濟基礎直接受其搖撼，最近英國貨款中國，協同平衡外匯，如果不談政治意義，而分析其經濟意義時，則誰都曉得「在維持他對華輸出的商品市塲」。換句話說：只因中國的物價，業已超過一般購買力水準，使他們在華的商品市塲，在日方的暴力阻碍之外，復樹立下一大阻碍。平衡中國的匯率即所以防止中國的進口物價之續漲罷了</p>
<p>而且我們重視這個問題的理由，與其說是由於現在的必要，母寗說是爲了未來，不能不先籌「防微杜漸」之計。因爲當前物價飛漲的主因，既然由於戰事影響；那末在戰事尚無結束希望的今後，也就是在刺激物價飛漲的一切原因繼續存在的今後，勢必還有無限沸騰的危險</p>
<p>（五）國府平衡物價的對策</p>
<p>國府對於戰時的物價，早有統制決心；只因這種統制，在經濟組織極周密的歐美各國，尚未脫離嘗試階段；德國「適正價格制度」，雖受世人讚道，但在經濟組織像一盤散沙的中國，實無模仿餘地。惟事實上既已不容長此放任，而且若能把物價中的投機中素掃除，就可平衡不少。只要各業都能放平良心，便可迎刃而解。所以最近終於分令各省市政府，分別組織平衡物價委員會，與各省銀行及地方銀行等通力合作，實行平衡人民日常必需品的價格，並規定平價標準三種：</p>
<p>（一）凡物品之生產及運銷成本，未受戰事影響或影響甚微者，以戰前三年或一年之平均價爲準</p>
<p>（二）凡物品之生產及運銷成本，受戰事影響者，以其在戰後之成本再加相當之利潤爲標準</p>
<p>（三）凡物品之成本不易計算者，以其經營所需之資本總額，再加相當之利潤爲標準，並規定平衡物價之物品以日用必需品爲限</p>
<p>平衡物價委員會的組織，係由地方政府及省銀行或地方銀行，暨商會同業公會等共同組織。對於工廠商號或私人囤積大量日用必需品，得由會呈請地方主管官署依評定的價格強制其出售。並規定違反左列各款意圖投機操縱的人，得依照農礦工商管理條例向法院檢舉之：</p>
<p>（一）同業間互爲買賣數量，不得超過存貨現量。</p>
<p>（二）非經營日用必需品之同業，不得互爲買賣市塲上之期貨。</p>
<p>（三）買賣日用必需品，不得設立交易所市塲</p>
<p>但在全國經濟上，迄今仍占重大地位的上海，又是投機最烈，物價飛漲最快的地方，却已不幸包圍在淪陷區裏，政治力量，已不能發生積極作用。要不是由民間出而自治，簡直就無從進行。所以上海市民能否解除物價上的不當剝削和酷辣的壓迫？只在看各業領袖能否出而支持和努力這一點？</p>

<h3>德國之安定物價政策</h3>
<p>— 陳寶鎔譯</p>
<p>本文係德國經濟學家華格湼氏所作，根據日文國際經濟週報第九九一期轉譯而來，原題爲「價格之形成及其安定政策」—譯者</p>
<p>以勞働爲基礎之貨幣制度，</p>
<p>物價政策之中心問題，不外爲安定價格之問題。當經濟內部發生劇烈變化時，如何使物價市塲不起變化是也。對於此種事實，常有種種認爲無可抵抗之理由。甚至所謂「數量景氣」，即成立於「價格景氣」。蓋在過去資本及其收益，恒占經濟生活之中心。而今日吾人之欲分析一切經濟現象之關鍵，則將於勞働及其給付中求之。因此，德國之貨幣制度，最初雖樹立於金之基礎上；而今日則已改取勞働爲其基礎。最初，吾人認爲欲保障國民將來之物質生活，莫如舊積貨幣；今則對於貨幣之此種保證，已失去其信心；代之以起者，爲吾人對於勞働之權利，並需與以永久的勞働權利而後可。且不僅在於勞働進行上之權利，進而復應保證其任何時期之所得。已失去其信心；代之以起者，爲吾人對於勞働之權利，並需與以永久的勞働權利而後可。且不僅在於勞働進行上之權利，進而復應保證其任何時期之所得。</p>
<p>德國之新物價政策</p>
<p>德國國社政府之經濟理論，既根本上採取此種新的態度；於是對于物價變動之影響及其所以發生變動之種種原因，更可以景氣變動而加以說明。從而國社政府之新物價政策，不僅以排除當前之阻碍爲滿足。過去最優秀之物價委員，僅需以敏捷之方法，解決其現實問題；而今則在現實問題外，復有解決其根本原則之必要。即如何使物價之變化，與今日經濟生活完全適應？高物價政策即努力提高物價而謀恐慌之克服的政策，固未始不可以刺激一般之經濟而誘發景氣；但物價之暴騰，實具有種種重大之危險，不能不予以深切之警戒。在過渡時期，高物價雖不無起活潑經濟之作用，但同時實亦在製造殺人之毒素。故德國國家社會主義條件的採行阻止物價上昇之政策，並對於此種企圖，本質上亦與一般所行之政策完全不同，一言以蔽之：即謀樹立一適正之價格是。</p>
<p>確立適正的價格</p>
<p>當經濟上一切方面發現價格昂騰之傾向時，即一方已影響及對外的經濟關係，而起不良之作用；他方又因負担之增大而使原料經濟發生變化，此種傾向，且猶不能將支配經濟各部門恐慌，充分予以克服，在此塲合：國社政府一方設定「最高價格」，使充分而合理地完成物價政策上之活潑計劃，以謀建設可能性之維持。他方則將各經濟部份，予以個別而根本的檢討。務使各部面之物價，皆與該部面之特質相應；即個別的適用各種特殊的統制。</p>
<p>考察價格政策，既不能僅就貨幣物價方面着眼。如用此種觀點，且亦不能與其目的一致。普通，在價格跌落時，總希望其回昇。特不知價格之高低，並非主要問題。真正主要者，在於價格間之相互關係是否平衡？對於國民經濟生活以及其他要素上是否相互適應？換言之物價水準是否維持適正關係？乃係問題重心。</p>
<p>所謂「適正之關係」，概決之於國民經濟，故價格概念，須由國民經濟全體之立塲而予以批判，即一方由經營上予以批判，他方以市塲價格予以批判。</p>
<p>今日德國之物價，一方與生產相適應，他方與勞働所得相適應。德國元首對於德國經濟唯一最關心之事，今日已僅在如何調達必要之勞働力而已。</p>
<p>德國價格政策之任務</p>
<p>近年德國之價格政策，雖已執行其安定經濟生活之機能。惟猶未能即以此爲克盡其任務。因在某種時期，應設法減輕外來之價格騰貴影響（即減輕世界物價騰貴之影響）；某種時期，應設法幫助開拓販賣市場，確立適當而有力之價格。當新原料之技術的發展之後，則又應確定其如何出售於市塲之價格？乃至在解決一切社會政策上之所需，以及解決供給上之技術問題等等，在價格政策上，概可發生其新任務。</p>

<h3>呢羢買賣之內幕</h3>
<p>— 浮石生</p>
<p>（續四月十日）</p>
<p>（五）發票</p>
<p>除掮客轉手，客方明白當然有扣佣開大一些外，其直接向行號廠方進者，自然準確實開。但往往亦有多開若干，此蓋示爲一律，以免行情擾亂，國貨廠方開票多如此，因其常有暗盤待收帳時扣除之。尚有交易川流不息之雙方遇有交情者，常開一「照」字（蓋代表照市前價耳，）此皆指同業中互相買賣而言。對於門莊顧客發票，則又一變化，因客路貨運常有關津，故多除複寫紙出現票母訛外，此外聽憑顧客吩咐再開假發票一紙。</p>
<p>（六）包盤</p>
<p>不論整箱及拆疋或零剪，同業中齊有包盤之先例。包盤者（就是保險貨價不呢虧，）有口說保盤，有在發票上註明保盤。包盤規矩大概以五天爲限（最多十天，）在未過限期內，如遇同一質地花色牌子之貨，價可便宜者，即須打盤照除之。保盤生意最爲硬掙，因之非不得已時，齊不肯說出包盤二字。保盤以期貨數爲多，現貨大路華服呢絨次之，西裝套頭呢包盤殊缺耳。（完）</p>
<h3>煤炭　炭亦有大連來貨　是亦值得注意</h3>
<p>溫州木炭、市上存底雖足、但因甌江航運時遭阻梗、倘一經封鎖、木炭來源、將受影響、故同業爲防荒而備、實則天氣漸暖、銷塲落令、去路固甚稀薄也、日前某某輪有大連草包炭裝來、計五六百包、每包重四十餘斤、售價每担三元左右、託掮客四出兜售、聞此次係試辦性質、倘有銷塲、當可大批裝來云、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子　現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>黑鐵坯子交易、因天津烟台青島諸幫狂辦、而本街熱水瓶廠·印刷廠·玩具廠等、亦爭相收買、故現貨軋缺、標準行情扶搖直上、每二百磅抬高至三十一元五角、查昨日北蘇州路某某等五金號裝到現貨五十餘噸、聞開價售三十一元六角、查已拋出十餘噸、但續辦仍多、聞該號爲應酬起見、除零星開出外、不肯　批拋售、</p>
<h3>進出口　建木杉板大批到滬　新港來貨亦不少</h3>
<p>建木杉板、大批運來、昨日又有三輪到滬、自福州運來建木杉板十二萬六千八百五十件、</p>
<p>前日進出口貨、有鮮蛋四十件、由新港運來、又運到金針菜二十六件、又石粉三十二包、亦新港來滬、</p>
<p>昨日有蛋黃白三十件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　法西襯充斥於市</h3>
<p>法西襯自戰後日貨無進口、西貨因滙價關係、成本突昂、昨愛二七七公茶會上俱售九角半、致買方用戶多攙用夏布襯及國產貨、九江陷落、夏布亦斷檔、國貨法西襯實銷大旺、又爲政府指定軍用品後、原料採購困難、致出品十之七八均爲粗蠟米綫所織成、小廠紛起、致法西襯充斥於市、廠方互相競爭廉價、經銷者及西服店均欲殺價、逐步下跌、昨洪盛老牌、每碼仍批沽七角七分半、華興·永成·新華·立興等諸什牌、每碼衹售五角五分掮客轉手、每疋尚可扣佣二三角、聞其自己成本衹有四角六分之譜、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖續漲甚勁</h3>
<p>昨洋糖漲勢甚勁、公會劃盤、二四荷粗白、本棧現貨以二十五元九角成交五十包、轉口貨呌十七元八角、太古糖B嘜西棧貨二十五元八角半、東棧貨二十五元七角半、較前日升二三角不一、國糖開出三尖白二十四元三四角、足上冰二十四元一角至二十四元、共計二百餘僅零星交易而已、石門片青續有運到、仍未開出、</p>
<h3>一年來　上海各業漲價統計</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>一年以來，上海的環境，誰都知道是有待於最後勝利的到臨，因跟戰事的擴大，物價是在騰漲着，這可在　售物價指數上看出來，而且，事實上確是這樣的展開，使得居住在上海的人們，一致都感到生活的脅迫，難以維持，內心是怎樣焦急和苦悶呢！</p>
<p>本來，戰時的物價，必然是較平常爲貴的，因爲運輸的阻滯，和供求的不調；而奸商的囤積居奇，也是促成物價昂貴的重要因素，所以一年來上海物價的騰昂，原是必然的結果，不過其中却有許多物價，是呈着畸形，主因便是投機的操縱，特殊勢力的苛征，同時又因政府統制外滙後，普通商品遭受限制，廠商欲購買外貨，不得不向外滙黑市塲上購買高價外匯，這樣成本是增重了，所以上海物價的高漲，又加上了這三種畸形的原因。</p>
<p>現在，就一年來各業在報章上刊登漲價的來統計一下，共有一百六十八起，除去重行漲價十八起外，凈計爲一百五十起，也就是一百五十個漲價的業別和工商廠號的單位，在這一百五十起的漲價裏，包括十六個商品分類，就是電氣·燃料·衣着·醫藥·飲食·衛生·裝飾·交通·文化·金屬·日用·土木·皮革·原料·消耗·和公用等，</p>
<p>再就其漲價起數月份來比較，那末，要推八月份的四十一起爲最多了，次之則爲九月份二十七起，七月份二十三起，六月份二十一起，十月份十七起，十一月份十三起，十二月份九起，四月份七起，五月份五起，一月份三起，二月份二起，三月份則無，（包括重漲的起數），這裏不得不來說一下，就是漲價起數較多的六·七·八·九月份，原因是那時外滙黑市的暴縮，以致居奇囤積的商人，藉口來漲價，所以，其起數是比較各月份爲多了。再進一步，分析漲價的商品種類，首推日用品類四十一起爲第一位，飲食品類三十四起第二位，衣着品二十二起第三位，醫藥品十二起第四位，電氣品類，燃料品類，文化品類均各七起第五位，皮革品類五起第六位，裝飾品類，交通工具品類四起第七位，消耗品類，原料品類，土木品類，公用品類均各三起第八位，而以衛生品類二起殿末，</p>
<p>這裏把漲價的貨物種類和漲價成數，分說於下。</p>
<p>（一）調味粉　漲自一成至三成半。</p>
<p>（二）紹酒　京莊每斤漲售二角五分六，小花雕每斤二角八分，太雕三角二分，餘略。</p>
<p>（三）麵食　切麵每斤漲售三百文，黃麵每斤三百二十文，皮子同上，綫粉每斤二百文，餘略。（未完）</p>

<p>美商代理各輪卸貨　美商華美公司代理之葡輪棠喬·棠貝·棠魯·三艘、自被扣後、各輪貨物未卸、故由公司報吿美駐滬總領、向日方交涉卸貨、因船隻雖係葡商、而所裝貨物、係美商華美所承裝、今日方已允所請、准予先卸貨物、昨據該公司某高級華員稱、公司已定明日星期一、派拖駁前往卸貨云、至於美達等輪貨物、日方仍不允先卸、</p>

<p>第二　國民精神總動員綱領內所指示之各點、均爲身體力行的要目、故我人不獨力求其知、必須力求其行、醉生夢死之生活、必須改正、奮發蓬勃之朝氣、必須養成、茍且偷生之習性、必須革除、自私自利之企圖、必須打破、紛歧錯雜之思想、必須糾正、凡此各項、在我人平日之生活中、應一一實踐、不稍假借、上海自成孤島以後、一小部份之民眾、如失所依、思想行爲、有不免流於腐化而不自覺者、上海畸形繁榮之根源、即在於此、亦有思想言論在根本上雖已形成統一、而枝葉上之紛歧、仍所在多有、長此錯雜、勢必民志分散、貽戰事於不利之局、所以我們自今以後、思想行爲、斷不容我人流於腐化、亦斷不容我人流於惡化、必須一心一德、必忠必信、舍小異而求大同、爲抗戰建國而戮力、</p>

<h3>饒神父的偉業（一）</h3>
<p>— 趙爾謙</p>
<p>記得某記者曾這樣說過：「紅格爾圖與百靈廟兩次戰爭，只是我們民族解放戰爭的序幕，」他又說：「紅村（指紅格爾圖）的中心是天主堂，這裏所謂「中心，」有兩重意思：就全村的位置上說，天主教堂在村的中心，而此村的社會·經濟·文化·乃至政治軍事的中心，亦皆在天主堂。天主教在邊省的發展，是有驚人的成績的，以綏東而論，真正支配社會的力量，不是政府而是教會。教會的教區，比縣治的政治區域來得有效，教會之發展，不是重要的以宗教思想來說服人：而是以教會和教士的力量，站在一般無依無靠的窮苦人民前面，替他們辦理生產教育自衛·醫藥·養老·育幼等人生必須的工作。</p>
<p>的確，這次戰役，天主教是有相當貢獻，在南北東西戰塲上，天主教會的神父和教友，均有熱烈的犧牲，驚人的故事，真是可以感天地而泣鬼神，在戰地成仁者也有，在後方工作者也有，遠者不談，單拿上海來說，這位赫赫有名的饒神父，已够人們的注意。去年七月，從美洲募捐歸來，道經日本，因赴籐田家小住而形成失蹤之謎，引起多少人士的憂慮，各報紛載此項消息，一時孤島上的注意力，幾全放在饒氏身上。他之所以能博得人們的同情、握住公眾的視聽與呼吸，因爲他是位神父，是一個人道主義者，本着他「愛人如已」的精神，身體力行，大家呌他爲難民之父，中國之友，外國人更把他所創辦的南市難民區，稱爲“Yacquinot　Zone”，用他的姓，在他慘淡經營的事業上　顆印，埀諸后世，以誌不忘。</p>
<p>上海法租界上，有些路呌金神父·勞神父·杜神父路，　在饒神父三字，雖然說不上　　戶誦，然而有口皆碑，在人們的心目中，也和那些路名一樣的熟了。神父是法籍，有兩個名字，真名是Yacquin　ot　de　Besange，中國名字是饒家駒，完全中國化，和馬相伯梅蘭芳的名字，一樣的入情入理，絲毫不刺耳，這是近代天主教士的作風，一到中國來，先請位通人起個名字，隨後穿長衫，拿起筷子來吃飯，讀中國書，講中國話，跑到鄉下去，和民眾打成一片去傳教，饒神父也經過這種訓練與生活；而且是一位傑出者。他的法國姓當中，因爲有一小de字，惹起許多猜測，說他不是公爵就是伯爵，總而言之，出身名閥，是一個貴族　冑。我想這個到可以不必如此說，饒神父是超然物外，本宗教精神，做人道事業，這正是他人格上的高貴，就和拍拉圖的思想超越（The　Divine　Ploto）一樣，令人永存仰止景止之心。思想人格的完美，是個人努力的結晶，似乎和曾祖玄宗不發生任何關係，用不着費事去調查他的家譜。</p>
<p>耶蘇會（The　Societ.v　of　Jesus）是生主教最有力量具有國際性的組織，會士遍於全球，率多才藝特之士，在明末清初之際，會士已來中國，如方濟各沙勿略，利瑪寶，南懷仁，湯若望，郎世寧之流，不但忠於所事，努力傳教，幷且以坤與，天文，數學，格致，明理，超性等專門學術，介紹於中國，西學東漸，此其　矢。耶蘇會士，不能謂爲無功。現在上海方面的文化事業，慈善事業，如徐家滙的藏書樓，天文台，孤兒院，徐滙公學，廬家灣的震旦大學，佘山的天文台，概爲耶蘇會士所倡創，至今繼續罔替，裨益人羣者匪淺。</p>
<p>我們所說的饒家駒，也是耶蘇會士之一，未來中國以前，在英國居留甚久，研究文學，旋於一九一三年來華傳教，迭在徐滙公學，震旦大學擔任講座，教授英文，學生多怕上他的課，但是沒有一個不喜歡他的，因爲他以真誠待人，成爲青年之摯友。他先前住在震旦大學第二宿舍內，後來搬到呂班路天主堂，差不多有二十年光陰，消磨於教書與講道之間，舌敝脣焦，誨人不倦。當一二八（一九三二年）滬戰來臨，虹口難民，急待拯救，需要一位不偏不黨，眾望所歸，雙方（中日）推重而不致惹起國際問題的人物，來擔負此鉅艱，當然非饒神父莫屬。</p>
<p>饒神父是富於熱情，敏於活動的社會工作者，他嘗對震旦的學生們說：『做社會事業的人，應該多活動，多交際，多研究心理，多認識朋友，因爲社會是人的集團，在裏面服務的人，非澈底了解牠不可，否則就不能成功，事業無完成的希冀。』他又精通英，法，中，希臘，拉丁等語言，是大　的演說家。（未完）</p>

<h3>神經衰弱與腎虧等症　對性慾衝動應加遏制</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>據日常經騐，知在人身各器官與衝動中，絕對受神經與心思之支配者，殆莫過於性系統。普通之官能與衝動，如飢，渴，睡眠，消化，呼吸等，只一部分受心思之支配。遇驚駭，焦慮，憂傷等情時，雖能暫停某官能之作用於一時，然不可制之於長久，更不能永阻其作用，惟性衝動則不然，用精神心思，不惟可制服之於數月或數年之久，更能使其無窮期之潛服，例如一人之全副心思及精神，集中於思想或體力工作時，或能力或注意專注於其有興味之工業時，則荒唐放蕩之念，不能入其心，邪淫浪漫之見聞，不能擾其神，惟人之心思懶散，體力無用時，則妄想之念，乃入主作崇，而其人危矣，試就尋花問柳，沈迷青樓之一百少年，而分析其當時之環境，與失足之誘因，可得九十九人係環境與試誘之犧牲品，決非經審填之考慮，而故爲邪淫者，最普通之誘因，如飽餐膏糧，與有刺激之食物，可以熱其血而昏其智，沈溺酒醇，可使好色之徒狂妄，無節制之吸酒，積漸令人之聰明，節制與決斷力變弱，俚俗之戲譃，與淫猥之故事，更足以壞人觀感，肉感性之跳舞，誨淫之影片，損友之脅迫等，皆足以使好色之徒如脫攬之小舟，漂泊於狂風大浪中，終人無可奈何之鄉。</p>
<p>人若淫慾過縱，往往能減弱其精力，例如自凟過度之人，或縱慾不加節慾之人，不僅其腦力衰退，且脊髓神經，性機能亦必病變百出，故多腰酸背痛，腎虧早洩等症，此種病症既已罹患，治療之時，尤應清心寡慾，凡關於足以引起性衝動之語言文字，概須遠離。然後積極服以德國動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，能够顯出非常有效的效果，蓋「補體康」乃係採取犢牛，牡鹿，猩猩，山羊，海狗等睪丸精質製成，具有補腦，補腎，補血的三大功效，余曾採用此劑治療早洩陰痿，神經衰弱等症已有七年，從未遇失效病例，故該劑已被無數中外醫家所推崇，樂爲介紹於病家，其女用「補體康」功能調經種子。</p>
<h3>咳嗽症的嚴重</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽之症，最易使人輕忽，原因是咳嗽患者，以其一時並無若何危篤之現象可怕，所以一直就延宕下來，而咳嗽也就愈演愈凶，馴致不可挽救。</p>
<p>從真正的病理上而言，咳嗽乃肺部排除外界侵入不良份子，正是一種抵抗禦侮的表示，若是用麻醉劑反而減低抵抗力，以余二十餘年之經騐，並參考各國醫家實騐報錄，惟德國徒梅博士所發明之肺病特效樂「補肺拿爾」一藥功效最著，不論如何頑固難愈，或將成癆之咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」後能於三小時內，收鎮咳化痰之功，補肺防癆，其功遠居魚肝油之上，此爲各國醫家所證明者</p>
<h3>自凟遺精及發育不全</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>自凟成習之後，其遺精即逐漸加密，以致其精血不斷流洩，而促成神經衰弱，腦弱健忘，及腰酸背痛等症，甚至阻碍其發育，使其發育不全。故患者有自凟遺精之青年，尤宜積極治療，要治療遺精，必須戒絕自凟惡習，服以「耐而斯遺精片」即能根治，如已由遺精而引起神經衰弱等衰弱症象，發育不全及早洩陰萎等症，宜服以「補體康」無不應手而愈，以下特舉一例以證實之。</p>
<p>患者嚴正康。昆明人，年二十二歲，學界（自訴）本人身體孱弱，發育不全，腦弱健忘，學業退化。（病源）受淫書之毒，致自凟縱慾過度，而造成發育不全等衰弱症象。（治癒經過）投以「耐而斯遺精片」以治遺精，再以「補體康」補其精腦，連服數瓶，遺精早瘳，即覺精足腦榮，精神煥發，而發育恢復，面色紅潤，體重增加。不啻再造云。</p>

<h3>尋花問柳是：危險的遊戲</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病，是大多爲不經意時之快樂中得來，此種快樂，就是在一般人逢塲作戲的尋花問柳的場所中找到的。所以尋花問柳的代價，不僅需要金錢，還需要痛苦。這確是代價最高的遊戲。人人皆知此是危險的遊戲，而仍趨之若騖。此淋病之所以日益猖狂，是不得不作有效的處理。</p>
<p>關於治療淋病的方法，言人人殊，考究實際，多難使我們臨床家難以置信。就余多年來之經騐，淋病衹有採用舉世一致公認之德國彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」一藥，最堪稱賞。余用之急慢性淋各種續發症，併發症等，無不應用取應。因此「克淋儂」一藥，遂爲淋病患者第一保證根治之特效藥，此事不特爲余所親自證明，而且爲國際人士所證明也。茲特摘譯美國康乃堡花柳病院院長麥加利博士之實騐報告如下：</p>
<p>患者伽約翰君，年三十歲，本某巨商之子，患淋病屈指已六七年，先後所併發之症已有攝護腺炎，關節炎，睪丸炎等三種合併症，備受種種痛苦，凡每年新出之藥物，靡不試用，而淋毒反而只有深入，嗣入余所設之康乃堡花柳病院治療，經余採用完備之診斷方法偵察病狀，知淋病已瀰漫全身血液之內，勢難用一枝一節之化學療法及透膜殺菌療法，可以奏功，乃用「克淋儂」爲內服劑，一方外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書囑其在家自療，結果於二星期內症狀大減，關節已可活動自如，攝護腺及睪丸之腫大均已消退，續治至五星期而全愈，迄未再發。</p>
<p>淋病餘談</p>
<h3>談談慢性淋之再發</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路轉角</p>
<p>一般人因淋毒性尿道炎，一入慢性，對於自覺症往往付諸缺如，因其痛苦已去，故多不措意，而任意妄行（如房事酗酒，勞動等），結果不僅使尿道炎之症象增劇，且淋菌假此機會，更行進一步之侵略而續發副尿道炎，攝護腺炎等。</p>
<p>更有患者，其先會患慢性尿炎，因服某種霸藥，或暫守攝生法，使淋菌藏　而平服，遂以爲舊疾已痊，不復顧忌後患，濫行房事，潛伏之淋菌受此刺戟而復蟄醒，遂肆行活動，甚者當時即發，遲者一二日內亦必出現，且有忘自身之有此夙疾，而遷怒異性，以爲異性不潔而使其傳染此病，豈不冤哉？余遇此甚多，謹述一例於此。一年前有邢望雲者，來余處求治，邢本一富家子，花街柳巷，時有其遊蹤，因而感染淋病，因貪服霸藥，及不得已而暫時不作治遊，故表面上的淋菌，一時雖不見活動似已獲愈，未幾與某女士結婚，未閱三日而淋毒再發，反疑邢女士之不貞，頗致憤懣，而不知某女士實爲邢君所害也。曾邀數醫檢查未定，經余診斷，確爲舊病復發，投服淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，及德國靜電療法，手術以矯正病態，其夫人亦屬服「克淋儂」，並外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，結果邢君夫婦之淋病，皆先後於四星期內完全治癒。偕居迄今未發，夫婦愛情和好如初。診時：上午十時至下午六時。每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>注重殲滅戰</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>這幾天一片克復之聲，眞足以使人精神鼓舞·對於抗戰勝利，格外抱着樂觀。不過我們巳知道，這不是總反攻，這還是消耗戰中的另一方式。總反攻的出現，聲勢一定還要浩大得多，而克復的廣與速，一定還要遠超於現在。現在，我可以說，這是相機的反攻，作進一步的消耗，消耗敵方的人力，換言之，這是殲滅戰。</p>
<p>以前，我們只是步步爲營，節節防守，以消耗敵方的人力物力爲目的，所以敵方來攻，我們就應戰，敵方不來攻，我們就不動，其情形有似乎挨打不還手。消耗的目的固然達到，而主動的權能却操在敵方的手中。因此，他們不來，我們便無可消耗，而我們所消耗他們的，過只偏於物力，而寬縱了人力。物力是易於補償的，人力是無法補救的，我們還只達到了消耗的小部份目的。</p>
<p>現在，我們相機反攻了。相機者，就是揀敵方的弱點，適於我們攻擊的，我們就主動地與以攻擊。能够有所克復，固然最好，不能克復，或者克復了不能堅守，也不要緊，因爲我們反正巳經達到了消耗敵人的目的。不過在這相機反攻的消耗中，我却希望我們的軍事當局，要特別注重敵方人力的消耗，換言之，我們要注重殲滅戰。</p>
<p>人力畢竟是戰鬥力的根源；即使全憑血肉，也可以築成新的長城。我們有的是人力，而敵方最爲缺少的也便是人力。我們在這方面遠勝過他們，其比例爲七與一。他們全國的兵力不過六百萬，到我們中國來的已在一百五十萬以上，所消耗的，已有六七十萬，假使我們專在這方面與以不斷的打擊，我認爲這是敵方的眞正致命傷。</p>
<p>我在報端所注意的，本來就是每一次戰鬥中，敵方所死亡的人數，一地的得失，猶是决焉者也。我相信只要我們始終奮鬥下去，始終　所殲滅，不要說一地的偶有克復，即便一地的續有所失，我也是充份樂觀的。而現在的相機反攻，却更可以達到這個殲滅敵人的目的，囚爲他們假使怕了我們，不來送死，我們却可以我上他們，而一一殲滅之，不像以前只好看着他們逍遙在我們的火線之外了。</p>
<h3>春耕</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>春風拂過大地，疏解了嚴冬的僵凝；萎凋的一切，都已復蘇了。樹梢頭萌動新芽，田路上也嵌鑲着嫩綠的細點，那一陣含熱的氤氳氣息，在鄉村裹瀰漫開來。</p>
<p>耕牛挺着兩隻尖銳的角，划動笨重的步子，在田塍中奔耕；　處翻起的泥濘，好像小輪船在江河中激起的浪花。</p>
<p>四月天，農村無閑人，駐防的部隊就頒發了助耕的命令。</p>
<p>一隊弟兄，走出破廟，望到浸浴在春陽中的農夫和耕牛，心頭都壓上了一層歡悅，放開槍柄，拿起犂鋤；隊長臉上也浮起了一陣微笑。</p>
<p>稻田上，立刻變換了景象：灰布的軍服，竹箸的笠帽，揮動細長的牛鞭，扶持犂靶在助耕，原來的農人反而空閑了。</p>
<p>驚喜飛上他們的面頰，一個年靑的農人一揮手，緊握着拳頭，熱烈而謙和地說：</p>
<p>「請你歇手罷，給國家出力的弟兄，我們不應該受你們的帮助，却應該帮助你們。」</p>
<p>接着，就把一枝竹烟管邊給老勇；但他不會吸烟，一轉身，又鞭策耕牛前進。</p>
<p>軟融的春風，橫掠過田面，不斷地播送着：新鮮而微帶濕意的淸香。生命的活力熔化在大自然裹，一羣弟兄都因而增厚了興奮。然而，忠實的農夫們，還是執抝地不肯偷閑，一次，二次的謙讓，最後更堅決地說：</p>
<p>「我們應築的公路，是你們帮築；我們應掘的壕溝，是你們帮掘；我們耕的田，你們又來帮耕；歇歇龍，我們眞不願你們代勞了，——雖然軍民應該合作。」</p>
<p>「是呵，眞過意不去哩！保衛國家，保衛我們，還要……」</p>
<p>當另一個農夫插嘴說話時，老勇也打起哈哈說：「强大的動力，現在是該寄托於農村了，請你別小覷自己，你們正會由壯丁自衛的訓練，進化到打游擊哩。你們的工作，就是我們的工作；我們的工作，也就是你們的工作。哈哈……」</p>
<p>談笑靜止，耕牛也隨時間消逝而疲倦，稻田上面的泥漿也給鋪得勻均了，望過去，像一張張黑絨似的地毯。於是，牽着耕牛，走上草原，一羣人圍坐在地上，把疲困又都消失在歡愉的談笑中。</p>
<p>金黃的夕陽光，由柔和而暗弱，暮靄漸漸地濃密起來；這時候，一羣人排成一條長的行列，踏上歸途。在平靜的田路上，由老勇領導，放開了雄壯的歌喉：——</p>
<p>「自己的家鄉要努力保衛自己的田地要自己耕耘。抗戰就是爲了自由；抗戰就是爲了生存。團結，前進！民就是軍，軍就是民，揮起槍鋤打敵人，軍民　條心！」</p>
<h3>砲口上的和平</h3>
<h3>笑與淚</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>……像霜痕初乾的落葉，消失於風的螺旋中，每人臉上褪去了笑。沒有笑意，皮膚也不免痙攣，不願笑而且也不能笑了。</p>
<p>輕輕的笑，狂風吹去了；淡淡的笑，黑雲隱蔽了；薄薄的笑，暴兩打穿了。雖然每個笑裹都包含着一段故事，幸福的，趣味的，每個人有許多故事，也還有許多笑，但這些故事終於被人盜竊了。安置在密密的　絨中，愛惜，愼重，珍藏，終不免破關，奪鍵，胠篋，傾囊而去。空空的錦匣，四顧茫然，幸福的趣味的故事，不留下一點記憶。沒有歡笑的餘資，酸鹹的冰柱乃澘然下垂了。</p>
<p>懦怯的人說：「我們的笑，一去不復返。幸福的趣味的故事被盜竊乾凈，我們還有什麼歡樂可言呢？」</p>
<p>那往往是一羣灰色的人，嗒然憂傷，涕洟滿面。笑，失落了故事也已忘記，終日苦浸於眼淚中，每一滴眼淚，也往往有一段故事。每人有許多故事，悲哀的，痛苦的故事不能忘記，於是眼淚便落下了。代替了昔日的故事，昔日的笑，眼淚滴落在錦匣中。</p>
<p>不是噩夢呢，錦匣雖未改，試以手摸索一下：你將發現你的兩手已爲眼淚所浸濕。啃囓着心的那麽許多故事像毒蛇，這不是幸福的趣味的故事了，悲哀底痛苦底回憶蛻成薄薄的蟬殼，給蟬殼包圍住，人淌下眼淚。再問蟬殼以歡笑，不知而亦無從了。</p>
<p>失落往日的笑，每人臉上都褂上一幅「憂鬱」。暴客的掠奪未曾追回時，不願笑而且也不能笑了。懦怯的人習於哀傷，終日浸在眼淚的深潭中，蝕傷，柔弱，疲乏，而且畏葸。「不去追回習日的歡笑嗎？」當眼淚把懦怯者剝削成孱弱時，我不禁負負高呼了。</p>
<p>痛苦磨蜴着我們，每人有許多不幸的故事，故事催人流下眼淚。不是暴客的爪牙，靦顏無恥的白痴誰願意强顏歡笑呢？</p>
<p>懦怯者吿訴我：「歡笑已去，你此後惟有以淚洗面了。」</p>
<p>倔强的我，却投報以無情譏笑，我回答：「我不願强顏歡笑，因爲我不是暴客的爪牙，但老實吿訴你呵，我對於以淚洗面。爲什麼你不追回昔日的歡笑呢，從暴客手中？」</p>
<p>默默地躱在眼淚中生活，只有耗損戰鬥的力量。我不願意多快活，也不願意多憂愁。</p>
<p>不是沒有笑：甘心自戕的因愚魯而笑了。殘食同類的因野蠻而笑了，媚賊作父因蒙昧而笑了，沐猴而冠的因卑汚而笑了。</p>
<p>我們說：這是笑，淚呢？</p>
<p>我們憤慨他們的無恥，我們能不悲憫他們的無知嗎？</p>
<p>「不是歡笑的時候了。」於是杞憂人乃悚然警惕。終日「悼惜」於消逝的往習，他們不去「找尋」歡笑。</p>
<p>我不願作無恥者，亦不願作杞憂者。</p>
<p>我有許多不幸的故事，我不免於憂傷。像許多人一樣：失落了笑，留下的是眼淚。沒有笑意，不願笑而且也不能笑。然而我也不願意讓匣中的淚汨汨長流，取笑於暴客，亦復蝕傷自力。我壓抑了悲傷。我的淚，不願而且也不能流。</p>
<p>我尋覓歡笑。不求諸昔日，昔日往往流於「懐古」，不求諸今日，今日易成爲「靦顏」，我時常把歡笑寄託於不久的將來。這是眞正歡笑的時候，這是用眼淚熬煉成歡笑的時候。</p>
<p>須從暴客的手中奪回舊有，我乃鍛冶感情使之如鐵：不笑，也不流淚。</p>
<h3>學老成</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>好像社會上有這樣一句話：老成者，無用之別名也。原來自從社會上崇尙花言巧語，滑頭虛僞以來，老成的人，便都婦淘汰，弄得生無立足之地，死無葬身之所，於是人人視之爲「　壽頭」，爲「曲死」，爲「洋盤」，爲「寃大頭」，一言以蔽之，爲無用之人，莫不深惡而痛絕之。影響所至，誰都怕別人稱他，老成爲而常以老成譏笑人，看來老成這個名詞，將成爲不祥名詞，而老成這個性質，將成爲惡劣性質了。</p>
<p>然而事有大謬不然者，社會上却另有一部份人，在死命提倡着老成，這究竟又是什麽一會事呢？</p>
<p>有些年長的父兄或師長，會對年幼的子弟或學生說，年輕人必須老成，少年老成，將來必成大器。最要不得的，是開口戀愛，閉口戀愛，在馬路上男女同遊，在大庭廣衆之間男女雜坐：行爲輕薄，不成體統。他們說這話，當然是對的，因爲他們對於男女之事，至多在暗地裹踰東家墻「摟其處子」，是別人所看不見的，無傷其老成。他們也會說夫婦是五倫之一，何等重大，總是少年血氣未定，動不動就說離婚。這話，當然也是對的。因爲他們自有老成的辦法：「不孝有三，無後爲大」，納妾。討飯吃的齊人，尙有一妻一妾，見之於孟子；納妾，不容說，是老成的行爲。</p>
<p>有些發財的大班，買辦，或什麼長，什麽理，會對年幼的小職員訓話：少年人要老成；老成了就可以得到東家或上級職員的信任，將來便大有出息。小職員於恭之下，自然巴不得一意力行，竭盡老成的能事，死而無怨。好在這些在上的所以在上，這些小職員大都是不知道的，他們只見他們長袍馬褂，規行矩步，果然老成非常，而偷天換日，假公濟私，種種超老成的行爲，他們就無從參與密勿了。</p>
<p>此外，自己以老成自命，勸人亦應該老成的，尙有多種人，甚至黃包車夫在和你討價還價時，也會說，規規矩矩，兩角洋鈿。夫規規矩矩，調非老成而何！</p>
<p>不過這種動人學老成，功效畢竟不大會顯然，因爲言者諄諄，聰者藐藐，本來已經成爲慣例；假使言者的處心積慮，嘉言懿行，一旦爲聽者所徹底了解，如見　肺肝然那末就誤盡天下之學老成者了。只有一種自己願意學老成的少年，他們所學的，才能根深蒂固，蔚成大器。</p>
<p>我時時看見許多少年，走路時踱着方步，惟恐踏殺螞蟻；坐下來時，彎腰曲背，鞠躬如也；咳吐之聲，不絕於其喉，於其口，迎風遍灑濃淡之珠玉；香烟一枝，老不去手，然而也老不入口，於是手指焦黃，資格老矣：或四裝，必有脫落之鈕子，而褲管弔到脛上，大可用杖一叩；或中裝，必愛其原來之色，必變其原來之形，曰，名士不修邊幅也；與人談話，與人通信，對年長如其祖輩，如其父執，如其師長者，必與之稱兄道弟，因爲他知道，孔子會師項棄，甘羅十二爲丞相，蓋聞道有先後，學業有專攻，本來和年齡無關；精於門檻，自稱老門檻，熟於上海，自稱老上海；一開口或者一提筆，便是什麽事已經幾年幾年了，那時我怎樣怎樣，現在我又怎樣怎樣，撫今思昔，感慨系之；或者一開口一提筆就敎訓人，儼然有獨得的秘訣，大可以賣賣野人頭；…………</p>
<p>這些少年，眞是天才；他人學到四十五十而無聞焉的，他們可以在十五三之間，一有志於學，就會學到立得逼淸逼爽，活龍活現。於是：他們在文化界爲文豪，爲作家；在工商界爲領袖，爲巨頭；在某某界爲大亨，爲路路通，爲兜得轉；………我對於他們，最是敬重，崇拜，甚至有一次，我吃到半隻童子鷄，用盡氣力，休想嚼得動分毫，有人說，此鷄也，少年老成者也，我就恭而敬之，拘斷食指，推過一旁，不敢，尤其不忍，再吃。</p>
<p>這樣，誰說老成是無用之別名呢？我們應該學；或被動的學，或自動的學，都可以，蓋及其成功，一也·一旦嗚呼哀哉，還可以博得「老成凋謝」的輓幛，豈不光及泉壤！</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本刋向來不和別的刋物開「筆戰」，而編者個人尤其不喜歡這個調調兒。所以凡是足以引起誤會的文字，本刋總盡量謹愼在先，如果存心吹毛求疵的，本刋也恕不奉陪。打抱不平或反攻的投稿，一概只好割愛，萬請原諒。理由很簡單，這種「筆戰」只有破壊性，在平時已不應該，在這舉國一致抗戰的時光，尤其不應該。假使有空，我希望大家多寫些建設性的文章。</p>

<h3>難民的善後</h3>
<p>— 百强</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會成立之後，就設了一個善後委員會，同時在秘書處內也有一個善後處。前者是注重建議，後者是從事執行。但是什麽呌做善後呢？而善後委員會及善後慮又在做些什麽事情呢？我想道非但是各收容所的難胞們希望曉得的，就是社會各界關心難民問題的人士，或者也要知道一點的。</p>
<p>所謂難民的善後，就是帮助難民自立使其减輕社會的負担，一般不願長期受人給養，而願自求牛路的難民爲數頗多，這些難民，在收容所裹本是無家可婦且又無舉可做，因受戰事影響，他們只得在收容所內暫時受人給養，原是無可如何之事。但他們的良心，他們的志氣，決不是長此困頓的！協會善後處，也就在這一點上，予以適當的處置，帮助他們打開一條光明之路，在人生過程的前途上，找到一種適常的方針，和歸宿。這樣一來難民問題旣可得而解決而社會秩序之安定與建國大計之推行，亦可得而解決，共利弊得失之間，關係實爲重大。現在上海難民救濟協會善後委員會，及善後處所採用的方法，計有三種。第一·對於可以離滬，另投親友的難胞們，予以船票，或是二元至十二元的川資旅費·第二·對於有一技之長的難胞，就其能力及經騐，代爲向各界介紹適當的職業。將在上海市商會，及各同業公會，各工廠商號，熱烈贊助之下推展難民的出路。第三·對於旣不能離滬，因無特殊技能而無職業可爲介紹的難胞們，當計劃予以訓練，將由協會自辦，或與工商界合辦，各種生產事業，以資容納。此外，還有特種的靴胞，如殘發，老人，孤兒等，將來也要設法分別予以特別注意。現在已經在惇信路圈定一塊空地，打算作爲將來孤兒教養院的院址</p>
<p>總之，這一切的善後工作，仍是需要社會大量的帮助，才有良好的效果的，願大家努力難民的善後。</p>
<h3>談救難撲滿運動</h3>
<p>— 漢枚</p>
<p>救濟難民，非有長時間的持續性是得不到效果的。因爲戰禍一日未消弭，戰區的難民，一日不能安歸。難民救濟協會有鑒於此，成立以來，統籌收容給養以及敎育生產諸事，成績美滿，所有難胞之給養經費，亦全賴各界人士之熱心認捐，以延續其生命，又因長日漫漫，需款孔亟，不得不訂立多種勸慕方法，而壽募此筆經費。在主持者種種苦心孤詣，吾人固應表示同情而予以熱忱之贊助。又在這許多勸募方法中，我最贊成同鄕組推行的救難撲滿運動，因爲這種儲蓄救難，輕而易舉，最有意義，只要推行得法，時間不妨持久，又毫無弊端。若能每個家庭，或每個學校商店，均能領用一只，按日或按月實行節約儲蓄，用以救濟難民，則一家不多，十家許多，集納起來，也就很有可觀，而且這種方法，大可引起一般人之興趣，又能養成各個家庭婦孺備蓄救難之習慣，所謂取不傷廉，最爲實惠，人人値得倡導與奉行，如能持之有恒，則於救難運動上大有裨益也。</p>
<p>大衆知識</p>
<h3>讀報門檻（二）</h3>
<p>— 譚天</p>
<p>在報紙上差不多每天登載一篇批評時事的文字，這種文字一般人都呌牠做「社論」通篇文字必然的是代表那報籠所處的立塲，所抱的思想的，因此「社論」的眞實義意，就是對於當前問題與事實的演變等情形，給牠一個公道的批評。正確的分析，以喚起民衆指導民衆並能以監督政府爲原則，所以現在的社論，多能在一致禦敵的口號下而統一起來，其有洋商的報紙，亦能以同情的立塲作正義的呼籲，很可以做我們的參考，但是現在有許多報紙，社論的名稱多不相同，有的標「時評」，有的標評壇有的標社評，更有的標評論，所有這些都是社論的別號，此外在社論的地位上，有時不登社論，而登外來的稿子，這就呌「來論」或「代論」，是表示那篇文章該報館完全贊同的意思，總而言之，也是社評而已。</p>
<p>輿論　輿論的構成是報紙的功能之一，這就是說報紙登出來的各種新聞或意見等，若能得到多數讀者贊同的時候輿論便構成了。輿論是多數人的綜合意見，是社會意識的反映，牠是自然發生的，雖說近代國家，往往拿新聞檢査制度來壓制輿論，改造輿論。可是一遇到下面的情形之一，與論依然是要發生的，即一，政府的錯誤政策經識者指摘；二，政府壓迫過甚，被壓迫者斷然反抗；三，被壓迫者對壓迫者的團結勢力之擴大。總之，輿論的勢力，是非常强大的，常言道「千人所指，必有一死」一個人若到處遭受唾駡。一定是不能長久的。</p>
<p>廣吿　廣吿是資本主義社會裹商戰的利器。商人要賣掉自已的商品，就必須用廣吿來號召人家來購買，這一點我們正用不着來解釋，住在上海的人等於住在廣吿窩裹，路上走時看見廣吿，家裹住時聽到廣吿只要可以使人注目的地方，無處沒有廣吿，而况報紙又是廣吿唯一的媒介？所以一般人的婚禮喪葬聲明道歉，必用廣吿，而救災救難籌款演戲火車輪運時間也用廠吿，這固是理所當然，但現在專門在廣告下工夫，而使人們來入殼的也很多。像藥品，算命等廣吿。就有許多不可靠。現在廣吿越做越進步了，竟有所謂「副刋廣吿一出現了。此法是用副刋作號召，而收實際廣吿效用，因爲若輩皆用某種專門學識以自居，非素有硏究者頗不易識破也。</p>
<h3>一週戰事</h3>
<p>— 吳光</p>
<p>本週戰事，華軍趁上週餘威，對於日軍施行壓力，南北戰塲，各重要城鎭，迭吿克復者頗多，截止現在止，戰事正繼續展開，茲將各綫情况，略記於左。</p>
<p>廣東</p>
<p>增城方面日軍，連日分兩路東向屏風嶺，及葫蘆頂進犯，華軍奮勇迎擊，已將增城緊密包國，從化方面日軍，向大窩朗及鱉　圩進犯。華軍兩面側擊，日方連絡爲之中斷，損失不貲。西江兩岸，新會，江門，一帶，仍在混戰中。馬口，新圩，大崗，各據點，均經先後克復。至海南島方面，日軍亦曾向定安，屬安，進犯，華軍以逸持勞，痛擊抵禦，同時另一部華軍，乘勢克復定安城。</p>
<p>南昌</p>
<p>南昌向塘日軍，藉飛機砲火掩護，與華軍返復遭遇數决，華軍迄未搖動。日前華軍奮勇進擊，日軍乃向南昌引去，於是向塘與高安縣城遂吿克復，經華軍乘勝急追，大城又入重華軍之手，口軍心有不甘，大舉反攻，戰况至爲猛烈。其後，華軍因衆寡懸殊，高安華軍，仍移原陣地。又武寗日軍，經華軍不斷反攻，在城西發生壯烈之爭奪戰，現仍在對峙中。</p>
<p>鄂湘</p>
<p>鄂東華軍，日前克復呂王城，河口鎭，王家店，現正圍殲黃安城內之日軍。鄂北華軍，進攻應山，安陸之勁旅，於收復郝家庵以後，續向縣城進發。日軍已向孝感引退，鄂中華軍，圍攻鍾祥，極爲得手。武漢日軍因鄂東，鄂北，鄂中，華軍，連克要地，正加强工事，以圖一決。</p>
<p>山西</p>
<p>向中條山進犯之日軍，上週被擊退後，現又活動，華軍趕往痛擊，乃又退去。晋東平遙，介休，靈石，之日軍，連日向平遙南各地猛犯，激戰數次，未有進展，霍縣日軍，上週犯楊家莊不逞，本周又向東犯，面戰一週，攻勢大减。</p>
<p>此外，豫境信陽日軍三千餘，分三路，一由西雙河渡河，一向楊柳河，趨淅河附近，西犯突圍，與攻信陽之華軍，發生激戰。華軍分道奮擊，已將日軍陣地突破，現包圍圈愈縮愈小，開封附近華軍。十一日午前突以大兵迫攻城垣，將城郊各要隘及車站，完全佔領。日軍據城頑抗，終爲華軍擊退，旋華軍衝入城內，克復城垣，現仍在激戰中。</p>

<h3>難民</h3>
<p>— 難記者</p>
<p>有些人，一提到難民就頭疼。</p>
<p>他們看不起難民，以爲難民是卑賤的，齷齪的，沒有智識的，是社會的渣滓。</p>
<p>可是，我們自己想想，我們的夥伴中，也很有能力的人，也很有學問的人，我們應當努力掙扎起來，使社會尊敬我們！</p>
<p>自然，齷齪與愚蠢，在所不免，我想，我們應該互相敎育，互相督責，互相勉勵，不負社會對於我們的愛護和期望。</p>
<h3>惇信路第一收容所</h3>
<p>— 春帆</p>
<p>惇信路弟一收容所，是成立不久的新收容所，惟其是新成立的收容所。所以我們對於牠的希望有新的特色，即所謂一切收容所設備上，管理上，敎育上，凡感到不完善的地方，都能在新的收容所中完善起來。據人家傳聞，說惇信路第一所，辦理很好，我是始終未知究竟。這次我抽暇至該所訪問一次，覺得第一所，不僅在名稱的次序上，稱爲第一，即從牠的成績上講，也可以當第一而無愧，拉雜介紹於下。</p>
<p>在戰前，大家都皆知道上海有平民村之設立吧？——大門聳立，房屋櫛比，其中里巷縱橫，設備周全，有學校，有廣塲，有娛樂室，其印象至今，猶在腦際，此次當我驅車至惇信路第一所時，極目環顧，儼然一大村落，與平民村之式樣，有同樣氣概，牌樓式之大門，聳立高空，爲虞洽卿先生所題之「上海難民救濟協會第一收容所」字樣。門啟處，爲一廣塲，當中甬道，兩旁有難民應接室，糾察室，總辦公室，服務處，照相室，以及難民區房屋等分列左右。顯得整齊淸潔，莊嚴肅靜，呼吸爲之一暢。這樣的情形，說句老實話，比之在上海住擱樓灶披間的人們，每天在空氣塞悶，烏烟瘴氣中，大概好得多吧！吾竊爲難民等慶幸，直底處，爲消防室，內停有救火車一輛，以保安全，該所設備周全可想見也、</p>
<p>設備　設備情形，　　　　有　民十九區，收容難民有五千餘人之多。計分第一區爲職工區，係職工家屬所居。第二區爲婦女區係婦女難民所居住者。第三——七區（又第十一·十四·十八·）爲家屬區，係有家屬之難民居住者。第八區爲殘廢區，係殘廢難民居住者。第九區爲單身兒童區係無父無母兒童居住者。第十區爲婦孺區，係無父無夫之婦孺居住者。第十　十三區爲單身男子區，第十九區爲遊民區，係街頭遊民所居住者。分區辦法，極其合理，且管理方便，秩序井然，尤爲餘事也。我按區巡視，逢人詢問，蓋其所謂區者，爲一廣大之木板房屋，陽光空氣，兩俱適合，難民皆在木板床上，床爲疊式，與小旅館疊床相仿。此法經濟合算，不佔地位，又甚美觀。每區設區長二人，各居近門之床位。與難民共甘苦，管理事宜，悉皆以身作則。故舉凡給養，衛生等，皆能有條不紊，可貴也。</p>
<p>該所佔地頗廣，四週有竹牆，爲謹愼起見，更圍以鐵絲網。而厠所浴室設立頗多。取其方便，經我巡視區域，有服務處，發售難民日用物品，保管處，保管難民給養及物品，娛樂室，供給難民娛樂遊戲。此外如厨房，老虎灶，洗衣間等，皆爲足跡所經之地。在難民診所內我得與一位病人談話，他說診所係紅十字會所附設的，辦事認眞，所有病人，經醫師與護士小姐負責診治而全愈的很多。這位病人，呻吟床第，他吿訴我說：「唉！天地良心！此地醫生，小姐眞好呀！」</p>
<p>管理　管理的情形，在前面我已稍爲說到一些，其實第一所的管理，與上海各所的管理，初無二致，但管理之毆格與周密。以予度之，實爲第一所之特點。該所總管理處處長蔡仁抱先生，平時辦事極其認眞，對於第一所之管理，尤其嚴密，蔡先生定出規的，不營私，不舞弊，不吸烟，不飲酒，不論職員與難胞一視同仁，共同遵守。我看全所人士，非但烟酒絕對遵守，即吐痰一事，亦不能隨意亂吐，况且各處皆有吿密箱，倘有不法者，可以任人吿發也。</p>
<p>關於難民出入，每人有一出入證，規定每天有一次出外機會，其出入證有專門管理人員從事收發，其住所難胞，皆佩有證章，載明年籍區所號數，而家屬號數，亦皆載明無遺。倘有事故，一看便知，且難民等皆須拍照存根，其有被認養之難民者，更須送照相與認養者，以留紀念。據難民稱：每天早晨，蔡先生親至所中有一次精神訓話，用播音機傳至各區所，其後更有音樂彈詞等播音，分別播送，以娛聽衆，嘗見難民屏息而坐，靜聽訓詞，亦一精神上良好之敎育也。</p>
<p>難民　（一）難民生活，也曾問及，每日兩餐，一粥一飯，上午十時吃粥，下午叫時吃飯，每餐每人領蘿卜乾一條，則以佐飯，生活甚苦，有非花天酒地中人士所能想像者。在婦孺區我與一難童談話，我們的談話是這樣的，「我的爸爸八一三被炸死了，媽媽和我一道住在這里，何時媽媽洗衣裳　有小菜吃，不先就　有」</p>
<p>「每天有得洗嗎？」　　月只有七八次呀</p>
<p>「你今年幾歲了？」「十三歲·」「你應該帮助你媽媽去做活呀！」「我拾過荒的（註即垃圾）因爲打不過人家，媽媽呌我不要拾了，」「那麽你又沒有小菜吃了？」</p>
<p>「憨笑。」「喂！我問你，你飯吃幾碗？」「四碗，」「吃這麼多嗎？」「不多吃晚上要餓的。」「你這樣說你爲什麽不留一些飯晚上吃」（大家一陣笑！）「不可以，偷飯要吃官司哩，」（註吃官司即受罰之謂）</p>
<p>這孩子的話入情入理，引起我無限的同情，咳！他的境遇應該由侵略狂的野心家去負担了。</p>
<p>依我觀察，難民中以婦孺比較活躍，她們不滿於難民生活，覺得做難民，受人家撫恤，是可恥的。所以她們儘有機會，去找尋工作，有的帮人家洗衣裳，有的帮人家穿扇子，有的縫衣邊，有的織毛巾，實在沒有行麼做，也在爲兒女補綴洗晒。她們皆是貧賤家庭出身，也許由於生活的習慣，養成她們勤勞的天性。小孩子也都很茁壯，看樣子只要有事給他們做，他們是樂於從事的，只有游民區，興其他少數男子，疏懶成性。對于自立生活，他們似乎少有興致。此外男子在外做短工的，也很多，將來協會當局於最短期內，籌設難民工廠，使難民等有就業之機會，化消費爲生產，則甚爲必要也。</p>
<p>敎育　（一）敎育問題，在難民所中，是相當重要的。第一所敎育分成人與兒童二種，是由陳鶴琴先生主持其事，當我走進兒童樂園時，（即兒童學校）見許多學生正在操演，行列整齊，精神飽滿，大家都很高興。另一部份幼稚兒童，正在上課，先生在講故事，他們坐在小凳上，居然也聽得神色自若。可惜我因時局關係，對於學校方面，很少接談，尤其是成人敎育根本沒有看到，就這樣很忽忙的辭別了。</p>
<p>綜上所記，關於收容第一所，詳細情形，尤未能一一記述，尤其是該所辦事上之特徵，以及設備上之完善，未能盡予介紹，掛一漏萬，在所難免，好在以後有機會時，再可記述，現在就算停筆了。</p>

<h3>戰前之上海市建設（一）</h3>
<p>— 琳琅</p>
<p>一　前言</p>
<p>上海爲國際鉅埠，擁有人口三百餘萬，在民國十六年以前，殆無市政建設可言，往昔來游者，率侈稱道送坦蕩，車馬絡繹，此皆就兩特區「公共租界與法租界」而論，非所語於市區也。軍閥時代，南市閘北，各有工巡捐局，因循苟簡，初無建樹；而淞滬商埠督辦公署，組織未臻健全，效能自屬薄弱，重以期間短促，經費困難，亦未能有所表現。</p>
<p>論上海之市政建設者，當自民國十六年始，第一任市長黃膺白先生，遵循總理遺敎，謀實現大上海計劃，就任伊始，即有市區及各種建設之確定計劃。當時市府初告成立，各局相繼設置，地方輿論，以規模過大，經費過鉅爲慮，膺白先生力排衆議，會有下列之言論：</p>
<p>『滬市華洋雜處，中外具瞻，百凡建設，均待着手。財力固宜珍惜，人力允可寶貴，須有充分之儲備，與適當之使用，而後建設事業，方能圓滿進行。倘力求减縮，事事保守，則大上海計劃，等於具文，良非因事制宜之道。吾人立法施政，始盡智慮以決之，繼票勇氣以赴之，終持毅力以成之，義所當有，浮言奚恤，日後自有事實，爲其答案也。』</p>
<p>膺白先生去職後張市長伯璇繼之，仍循前任方針，努力以赴。及至張市長岳軍就職，更苦心擘劃，慘澹經營，大上海之規模，已具雛形，吳市長鐵城到任後，復發揚而光大之，以原有計劃，付諸實施，於是上海市之建設，燦然大備，故論上海之市政建設者，黃膺白先生　訂計劃，樹其始基，張市長伯璇，張市長岳軍，循途邁進，完成大半，吳市長繼續努力，成此大業。滬市民衆，對歷任長官，本一貫精神，爲市民造福利，實現總理計劃，念茲在茲，當永遠銘諸心版，未能去懐者也。</p>
<p>欲言大上海之市政建設，千頭萬緒，苦不知從何說起，下此所述，僅就其犖犖大者言之。吾人假定以上海市政建設為三期，則擴展南市閘北之道路，與夫整理舊有公用事業為第一期，發展市區交通，開闢道路爲第二期，而市中心區之建設，則爲第三期。吾人就此三期中之建設，詳爲研討，無論屬於地方的或中央的，均爲繁榮大上海之整個計劃，未容偏廢。茲者全市精華，毀於一旦，就上海一市而言，誠可痛惜，就整個國家言之，則又不足以言痛惜，蓋敵人之所能摧毀者，爲吾人之物質，所不能摧毀者，爲吾人之精神，不破壊無由建設，今日之大破壊，未始非他年偉大建設之先聲也。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，上海市政建設，不過十年，爲期至暫，而規換之宏偉，已臻於近代都市之境地，敵人崩潰之日，即吾人重行建設之時，再假以十年，上海市政之進步，不知至於何種程度，痛惜云乎哉？摧毀云乎哉？</p>
<p>（甲）市中心區建設</p>
<p>中國國民黨總理孫中山先生，於所擬之大上海計劃中，曾云：「上海現在雖已成爲全中國最大之商港，然苟長此不變，則無以適合於將來爲世界商港之需用與要求………。」上海市歷屆市長，爲促進孫總理大上海計劃之實現，對於改造上海商港，以適應世界潮流之方針，進行不遺餘力；而其中最重要之一端，厥爲建設大上海「核心」之市中心區是也。</p>
<p>上海市區及其各種建設計劃之確立，始於首任市長黃郛時代，而市中心區域之劃定，則係民國十八年七月，第一二三次市政會議所議决者也。當時制定以江灣區翔殷路以北，閘殷路以南，淞滬路以東，及周南十圖圖衣五圖以西，約七千餘畝地，爲市中心區域。並於同年八月設立「上海市市中心區域建設委員會」，主持設計事項，嗣後所有水陸運輸，道路系統，分區計劃，及溝渠碼頭等項，均經陸續按照計劃，次第進行。至民國二十六年七月，市府舉行十週紀念時，各項建設均已斐然可觀，十年以來之締造經營，於此吿一段落。所惜事隔一月，「八一三」之愛起，此燦爛之市中心區域，不轉瞬四淪爲瓦礫之塲，吾人緬懐已往，誠有不勝其悲憤者矣！然人能破壊，我能建設，收復而光大之期，當不遠耳。茲將市中心區域之各項重要建設，述其槪要如左：</p>
<p>水陸交通　市中心區域之發展，與水陸運輸，關係　切。故其交通上之建設計劃，水道爲吳淞開港，陸上爲市內鐵路綫改道。吳淞開港之目的，係在適應將來之上海繁榮，擬以吳淞爲碼頭區域，容納外來巨舶也。並擬於相當地點開鑿運河，使蘊草浜與吳淞江聯成一氣，以利轉運。此項計劃，以需款浩大，乃未實現。陸上交通之促進，以已成鐵道之改綫爲首要，其計劃係：假定由眞茹附近築一支綫北經大塲，胡家莊之東，折東沿蘊草浜東岸，至吳淞江一帶，與商港及虬江碼頭相啣接；更由眞茹染一支綫，經彭浦而抵江灣，爲未來之上海總車站。「一二八」之役此站被燬，鐵道部曾採納市府建議，決定以彭浦中山路附近爲兩路聯運總社，但亦以經費關係而作罷。黃浦江建橋，亦爲促進水陸交通計劃之一。建橋地點：一在五權路之東端，對岸可通至浦東高行高橋等區·一在龍華嘴附近，以備他日鐵路綫由此展伸至浦東，媾通浦東西之運輸綫。</p>
<p>道路溝渠　按照市中心區道路系統計劃，全部道路共二百餘條之多，可分爲兩點：一幹道，由市中心區四向沿長，如星光之四射，以聯絡商港，碼頭，及各市區。已築成者爲：其美路，黃興路，三民路，五權路，世界路，大同路，淞滬路，軍工路，水電路，閘殷路，及中山北路之一部份。二，次要道路，爲便利市中心區，及其附近的商業與交通而建築·以世界，大同，三民，五權四路，劃分市中心區爲東北，東南，西北，西南，及中央五小區。除中央一區，路名冠以「府」字外；東北區內之縱路，路名冠以「中」字，橫路冠以「上」字。東雨區縱路冠以「華」字，橫路冠以「海」字。西北區縱路冠以「民」字，橫路冠以「市」字。西南區縱路冠以「國」字，橫路冠以「政」字。故市中心區域以內，縱路順序冠以「中」「舉」「民」「國」四字。橫路順序冠以「上」「海」，「市」「政」四字。中部路名均冠以「府」字。第一第二兩次招領地，及市府職員招領地內各路，共長一百十九公里。其中與舊市區聯接之幹道，爲：其美路，自翔殷路，淞滬路口，接通狄思威路，全路長五·〇二五公里，寬三十五公尺·黃興路，接通市中心區淞滬路，與楊樹浦寗國路之間，全路長一一·六五公里，實度卅公尺。翔殷路，爲接通閘北區及北四川路之交通要道。市中心區溝渠係採用合流制，各溝管之佈置，因地勢關係，採用散射式。經數年來之建設，第一第二兩次招領地，及職員招領地內溝管，均已埋置完竟，共長三十六公里。</p>
<p>分劃區域　市中心區劃分爲三大區，即一，行政區，在市中心區之中央部份，凡行政機關，及重要公共建築，如市政府與各局，市參議會，黨部，圖書館，博物館，航空協會等，均建設於此。二，住宅與商業區，除已劃爲行政區及園林區外之土地，均爲住宅區與商業區。住宅區又分爲兩種：地位在園林空地之近旁者，供建築高等住宅之用；其他土地，不在上述之例者，供建築普通住宅之用。前年秋止，在第一第二兩次招領地內，已有住宅商店，菜塲等之分布。三，園林空地區，已有第一公園，市園林分塲，及市體育塲等·他如市醫院，衛生試騐所，市立實騐小學校等，及其他公共建築之需要空地者，亦在此區域內建築。</p>
<p>市府大厦　市政府大厦之建築，先由建設委員會擬定設計標準，計分三點：一，新市政府立體式樣，應採用中國式；二，新市政府平面佈置，應各局分立；新市政府建築步驟，應分兩部營造·標準定後，即由該會擬具懸賞徵求新市政府房屋圖案辦法，於十八年十月一日開始徵求。決定徵得之圖案，係取北平宮殿建築，參以現代需要，俾美觀與實用兩皆齊備。十九年七月設立健築師辦事處，造就一切圖樣說明書，經市政會議通過，招標開工。七月七日行奠基禮，受「一二八」事變影饗，停工者五個月。二十二年十月落成，即於二十二週國度紀念日，舉行落成典禮。十二月甘五日起市府聞始遷入新屋辦工，各局亦分別遷入臨時房屋。八一三戰事旣起，市中心區淪爲戰地，此巍巍巨厦，亦遭日軍砲火，稍受燬損矣。市政府房屋爲中國式建築，分爲四層，自外觀之，第一層爲平台，平台之上爲二層宮殿式之房屋，最上一層則隱於屋頂之內。其內部，第一，三兩層爲辦公地位，第二層爲大禮堂，圖書室，及會議室，第四層爲儲藏檔案，什物，及供員役居住之用。各層總面積爲八，九八二平方公尺；屋頂最高點距地面的計三十一公尺；全屋總長度約九十三公尺；寬度，中部二十五公尺，兩萬寬二十公尺。外表採用梁柱式，屋面蓋綠色琉璃瓦，屋脊用金黃色琉璃瓦，及水泥點金裝飾，備極富麗壯嚴，房屋四面均裝鋼質門窗，下層四面建石階。正面石階，自屋外地面直達大禮堂正門前，因拱成橋，俾車馬可直達正門·階旁有石獅兩座，及旗杆台兩處，每當晴和天氣，靑天白日滿地紅之中國旗，高昇旗桿，隨風飄揚，見之心怡悅目。市府房屋之內部佈置，中西參合，注重實用。就各屋面積言，以大禮堂，圖書室，食堂等爲最大，蓋以供全市政府，包括附屬各局之公用也。市政府大厦爲新的建築，其電氣設備，極稱完美。較爲新穎者，如：電話會議設備，供主席一人與其他十人通話會議用者，重要職員可不離坐位，即在電話中舉行會議，尋人設備，可用燈光及鈴聲，在三十個地點，發訊號二十七種，爲尋二十七人之用者。火警報吿設備，如有火警發生，管理人員可立刻確知發生火警之地點，爲緊急處置之用。其他電氣設備之小統計如下：大會客室內設電氣母鐘一具，附掛子鐘三十六具；全屋內装電燈四五五盞；電扇，牆風扇十八具，吊風扇三十一具；電梯二具，除電氣設備外，所有熱氣管及衛生設備，均極週到。市政府大厦之總造價的爲國幣七十八萬元，其電氣器具及設備方面，計約九萬數千元，除市府大厦外，其附屬之社會，敎育，衛生，土地，工務五局臨時房屋兩所，總造價爲二十一萬四千叫百元，於二十二年二月開工，同年七月完成。</p>
<p>其他建築　市中心區之偉大建築，除市府巨厦外，尙有運動塲，博物館，及圖書館等。茲分述其大概情形如下：（一）市運動塲。建築工程開始於二十三年八月，至廿四年九月竣工。全塲包括運動塲，游泳池，及體育館等部份，佔地約三百畝。三年前，全國運動會在滬舉行，往市運動塲觀光者多至十五萬人，誠盛事也。上述三部份工程之經費，約計一百十五萬元，以如是鉅量之金錢，建築大規模之運動塲者，在國內尙屬創舉。市運動塲之主要建築爲運動塲，當建築之始，預計全國運動會舉行時，至少塲內須容觀衆六萬人。但限於經費之故，全塲座位祇限五萬，惟尙有餘地，可供二萬座位之建築耳。運動塲之主要用途，在供田徑賽之用，中央有足球塲，網球及籃球塲在兩端。橢圓形之塲地計有五百米達，兩側之長跑道，各爲二百米達。觀衆之座位，計劃新穎，進塲出塲，來往交通極爲方便，乃其特色。售票及管理方理，設計亦均進步。供給運動員，及辦事員之休息或辦事房屋，亦頗寬暢，可容二千人之譜。看台下之餘地，盡量利用，闢爲鋪面，洗盥所，及售票之用。看台四週樹有旗桿甚多，舉行運動會之日，錦旗飄揚，爲全塲生色不少。全部建築材料，均係鋼骨水泥，惟基層則間用紅磚及人造石，，而外墻則以笠石爲材料。此則因其在經濟及耐久上，咸有可取之處也。游泳池係露天式，四週有五千座位。看台之下，築有更衣室，淋浴室，休息室，鋪面，洗盥室，鍋爐間，及濾水機室等。池長五十米達，國二十米達，乃係依據遠東運動會之標準而築者。池中最深之慮爲十一尺六寸，較淺慮爲六尺深，最淺處爲四尺，其狀乃作「匙形」。全池水量達六十萬加侖，如欲不時換水，所費殊大，而一次換水之時間，又多至十小時也。今日世界流行之新式游泳池，已廢止換水之法，而以濾水機代之。濾水機之動作循環不已，每隔六小時，全池之水即澈底濾淸，故池中之水常保潔凈。光綫佈置，又爲此池特色之一。水面以下之池壁上，裝有强光之電泡，入夜池水映光，澄明可愛。體育館爲室內運動之主要塲所，一切佈置，咸作最新式者。全塲有固定之看台座位三千五百個，臨時座位一千五百，遇必要時尙可增益。塲之面積爲一百三十一呎乘七十六呎，足供三個籃球隊之用。體育館之屋頂作拱形，最高之天花板處，離地板六十三呎，屋之全長度爲二百七十呎，全闊度爲一百五十呎。觀衆入門後，由兩梯導入梯層之座位，頭門口之地位甚爲寬暢，兩旁爲辦公室，售票房，洗盥室等所在處。全部建築材料，除地板及門，係用木料外，均係鋼料及水泥。光綫設備亦佳。</p>

<h3>黑與白</h3>
<p>— 羅昔</p>
<p>「君子愛財，取之有道」，本來是極平常極普遍的道理，但現在在孤島上要找出一個眞正「取之有道」的「愛財君子」來，的確要在千數或萬數中才可辦到！</p>
<p>誰不要財？但是，要「取之有道」呀！所謂「道」並不是包括一切可以取得到財的道路，而是不背於良心，不背於國家民衆的，才可稱之爲「道」！難道現在一般專以營私舞弊，發國難財，靦顏事敵，以及出賣罪惡（如：詐財，販毒等）而「取財」的偽君子，是不知道這道理的麼？不，反之、他們却往往都是以「爲大衆謀福利」爲口號，最近本市之慈善機關中的舞弊案就是件鐵例！他們未嘗不知道舞弊，營私，事敵，出賣罪惡，發國難財的結果都是作惡，犯法。但他們爲什麽要掛羊頭賣狗肉而明知故犯呢？總括一句，不過是因爲「自私自利」！根本他們是沒顧慮到「脣亡齒寒」。</p>
<p>全面抗戰延至今日，黑與白是淸晰地給正義的火把照明了。我們已不必再呌這些僞君子們拿出他們已經發黑的良心來，我們唯一的對付辦法，就是嚴厲的在國法上予以應得的處裁！</p>
<p>在光耀的正義的火炬遍照之下，黑與白是絕對不會糊混的！</p>
<h3>在內地的上海兒童</h3>
<p>— 卡蒙</p>
<p>「孩子劇團」的偉蹟</p>
<p>一輛沒有馬拖，別處不大有得看見的很大的卡車，開到一個村莊裹面，車上載着面孔上現出懇切的樣子，穿着灰色制服的十多個男女兒童。他們在軍隊中分送信件，在所有的農村中張貼圖書標語，把傳單散給農民。村裹的住民都在表示驚異，他們也不認識字，但他們能够看見圖畫上面，像鳥一樣的東西，把蛋投擲下來，女人，孩子都被炸死了。</p>
<p>當天的下午，這些新來的孩子，在村裹的一塊空地上開起會來，一個十二歲模樣，面孔瘦小的兒童，立在粗糙的講台上說話了：「中國是統一的，另外有一個邦國呌做日本，攻擊中國，想把中國征服而分化。」村民祇是眼瞪瞪的互相觀望着，他們正在驚奇誰是日本人，但這個年輕的演說家雖然得不到反應，却並不失却勇氣。</p>
<p>「他們來的時候比蝗蟲還快，」他說：「在能够飛的機器裹面，他們將殺死你們，他們會燒去你們的屋子，毀損你們的妻子，奪去你們的土地，把你們常做奴隸……在別個村莊裏，這些事情他們都已做過，他們也將會在你們的村莊裹這樣做法。」在大衆的裹面，這好像是一種電力，這幾句話他們是聽得懂的。土地，他們願意放棄嗎？妻子，他們願意給人侮辱嗎？房屋，他們願意給人燒掉嗎？他們正希望這些兵駐紥在村裹，保護他們的生命財產。然而那個演講的孩子，就抓住這一刹那的心理，繼績講下去：</p>
<p>「我們一定要和他們作戰，」他大聲的說，「我們一定要把他們趕出我們的國土，使他們打來的海洋中回去。」的確，目前中國有許多農村住民，還不知這些事情，這些孩子担任宜傳工作而喚起村民的，便是上海的「孩子劇團」，也就是中國的「　小鬼」的核心。</p>
<p>一九三七年十月二十七日的晚上，閘北是火燒了，整個上海在火熖之中。蘇州河的北岸，四行倉庫裹守着一支軍隊，和日本作最後的英勇抗戰，獲得「孤軍」的稱號，在中國歷史上造成了光榮的一頁。這時候，南京路上一條　堂裹，有二十一個男女兒童，聚集在一間屋子裏會議，決定此後他們將做些什麼工作。這裹面大半是九歲到十三歲的男女童子軍，在上海，他們救護傷兵，傳遞消息，工作了有三個月之久。</p>
<p>勇敢的中國軍士，（大家確信可爲中國爭得勝利的！）是離開了上海，可是他們決不願留在後面，經過一夜的會議，決定負起他們戰時的重任。第二天又經過一天的準備，運家長都不吿訴，背了人坐船到南京。可是政府把他們二十一個祇是當做難童看待，使他們非常的失望，他們是爲了帮中國戰勝而來的，不是想住在收容所一裏，但在南京極度緊張的情狀之下，他們的一片熱心，是再沒有人注意到的。</p>
<p>在南京淪陷前的兩星期，他們又決定再深入到內地去。到了徐州，那時他們共有六十個孩子，以「孩子劇團」的名義，在每一個可以走進去的鄕村中工作。鄉村中的人們，都當做他們是士兵，地方政府也全知道，他們所做的工作，是別國兒童所不能做的，造成歷史上驚人的一頁。他們需要食物，農民也很願意給他們。農民對於軍人，歷來固並無好感，但他們巳知道目前的軍人，是爲中國抵抗貪得的日本而作戰的。</p>
<p>後來他們又打除州輾轉到各地，在某一個農村之中，碰見幾個八路軍的游擊代表，敎導他們怎樣上演一幕劇，怎樣對大衆演說。這個「孩子劇團」，兩年半前在上海正式成立，而今足跡所到的地方，巳踏遍了中國地圖的全幅。一般的民衆，對他們的工作，都很熱烈的贊佩，而他們已成了「小鬼」的核心了。</p>

<h3>養成工</h3>
<p>— 玉全</p>
<p>他們做着「正式」工人同樣的工作　但沒有工資還需貼「原料損失費」</p>
<p>「養成工」這一個名詞，說來大家恐怕要感覺得很生疏的吧？初進工廠而不會做工，開始學習的工人，就呌「養成工」。這種工人是拿不到工資的，因爲他們本來不會做工，他們祇有消耗廠裹的「原料」，而不會眞的做出什麼來，所以「養成工」不但是拿不到工資，有的還須按月貼補給工廠的若干的「原料損失費」；並且這一種工人，必須在廠裹做過五六個月的「養成工」後，才能成爲「正式」工人，派給他們工資。可是，在這五六個月中，繳給工廠的「原料損失費」，爲數已很可觀了，不知要多少日後，所得到的工資，才眞正是廠裹所發出來的錢呢？</p>
<p>「養成工」所做的生活，和「正式」工人完全一樣，飯也是吃自己的。起初學習做工的幾天，自然不大熟手，必須要消耗去一點「原料」，但經過十天半月後，所做的工作，也就會漸漸熟手，和「正式」工人做成的可以完全一樣了，決不會需要五六個月才得學成的，所以，這無疑是開工廠的資本家的削剝工人手段。不過也有些工廠，一兩個月後，就可拿得到工資，但這却是極少數的，也就要看資本家的「慈善之心」了。</p>
<p>貧苦的人，到工廠裹去做工，原是想拿到幾個工錢，來解決生活問題的，可是辛辛苦苦的替工廠裹做了工，非但得不到工資，反要拿出錢，去貼補工廠裹的「原料費」，有這樣的理由嗎？然而，在資本家的心目中，除去了錢，什麼「人道」，什麼「慈善」，什麽「人類的同情」，是絕對不會存在的，他祇是在各方面想盡種種的方法，來削剝工人，榨取工人，將工人們的汗血，當着唯一的賺錢的工具而已。在資本主義的社會裹，貧困的工人至何日才能得見天日呢？</p>

<p>湘子回去以後，倒足以伴老父的寂寞。但是家中窮苦不堪，老父本來是個大學敎師，現在也失業了。哥哥向來是個實業家，從軍以後，只好棄職。雖說他們政府裹，對於出征軍人，有所補助，但到後來，却是有名無實。因此他們都市裏也不能住了，只好遷移到鄉村間去住。這時湘子還不能使人知道，她是嫁過中國人的，嫁過了中國人而被人家離異的，更要敎人瞧不起。然而越是鄉村間人，越喜歡査三問四，有時還有人故意造她的謠言。又因爲湘子姿色出衆，有美人之稱，便有一班鄉村間的登徒子，垂涎於她，弄得她時時防衛。幸而她後來分娩了，却生下了一個男該子，屋子裏有了孩子們的笑聲，也可以聊慰岑寂。他們祖孫三人，住居在鄉村之間，勉强可以度日。可是不幸的惡消息來了，她的哥哥，陣亡在中國內地湘鄂之間。屍骨也不得回鄕，只有一罐骨灰，回到國內，也不知是她哥哥的，不是她哥哥的咧。湘子和她的哥哥，感情本來很好的，此刻更哭得死去活來。她的老父，僅此一子，自然更加悲慟。因爲年紀老了，遭此顚沛，終日書空咄咄。他想：這都是國內軍閥害人，要不是野心勃勃，肆意的侵略人家，也不至於起什麽戰爭。倘然不起什麽戰爭，則我們正好安居樂業，何全於這樣的女離子殞，家破人亡。在今日我們還不是一個家人團聚的小康之家嗎？他是個老敎師，素喜弄弄筆的，在憤恚之餘，寫了一篇文章，是一篇反侵略反戰爭論。可是這篇文章却關下了大過了，經人檢舉以後，把那個老敎師拘人獄中。那個老敎師本來痛子心切，怎經得起冉受牢獄之刑，早已一命嗚呼。湘子此刻自己家中，已經沒有人了，她想在本國也沒有什麽留戀，還是到中國去吧。到了中國，無論在那個窮鄉僻壤，躱過幾年。因爲她已說得一口好中國話，也曾經穿慣了中國衣服，久已歸化中國，沒人看得出她是日本女人的了。到了中國，倘然徼天之幸，遇見了陳君，把這個小孩子送還了他，保留了他一點骨血，我的心事，經算是完的了。（八八）</p>

<h3>Aircraft Deploy Daily to Assist in Battle; Chinese Forces Fiercely Attack Shangang from Conghua; Large Chinese Force in Northern Jiangxi Closes in on Lintang; Japanese Forces Southwest of Fengxin Surrounded</h3>
<p>Recapture of Zengcheng of Great Strategic Significance</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese Air Force has been flying to the front lines of the East and North Rivers for days, assisting the Chinese Army in its counter-offensive. They frequently engage in aerial combat with Japanese planes, gaining a significant advantage and maintaining the initiative everywhere. In the battle of Taipingchang in Conghua, many Japanese and puppet troops were captured. Chinese guerrillas are active near the suburbs of Haikou, and machine gun fire is frequently heard. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Military sources say that the Chinese army attacking Zengcheng engaged in fierce fighting for three days, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers, and finally recaptured the county seat on the morning of the 14th. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, and their forces have completely collapsed. According to a certain military strategist, the recapture of Zengcheng is of great strategic significance. This area has a strategically important topography, relying on the Zeng River to the east, supporting the rear of Shilong, pointing west to the southern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway, controlling the throat of Guangzhou, and controlling the Canton-Kowloon Railway to the south, serving as a hub for transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong. It is the most important stronghold for the Japanese in the East River area. Now that it has returned to the firm control of the Chinese army, and at the same time, Huaxian, a Japanese stronghold in the North River, has also fallen into Chinese hands, providing sufficient support. The Chinese army, relying on this major favorable stronghold, overlooks the overall situation, taking advantage of the commanding position, controlling all the Japanese troops in Guangzhou, Shilong and other places. Especially the Japanese troops trapped in the isolated city of Guangzhou, after this battle, their connection with the Japanese troops on all lines has been completely threatened by the Chinese forces. Therefore, after the disastrous defeat, the Japanese may not be willing to give up and will attempt to counter-attack. However, under the strong defense of the Chinese forces, they will continue to exert their efforts to inflict painful blows. No matter how great Japan's ambitions are, they will never succeed. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, a squadron of Chinese aircraft flew to the West River yesterday to assist in the battle, dropping many heavy bombs over the Japanese troop positions in Sanshui, Jiujiang, Shaping and other places, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army. (16th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army in the North River advanced southward from Juntian, Huaxian, this month. Yesterday, the vanguard of the Chinese army had reached Xin Street and is now advancing towards Jiangcun. The fighting in the West River area is still fierce, but neither side has made significant progress. After the Chinese army in the East River recaptured Zengcheng, it immediately advanced in two directions, one attacking Shitan to the south and the other advancing westward towards Guangzhou. (16th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: At Shenshi hour on the 15th (3-5pm), more than 5,000 Japanese troops advanced from Shangang and Taipingchang towards a certain location southeast of Conghua city, attempting to cut off the connection between the Chinese forces between Conghua and Zengcheng. The Chinese army is currently engaging them. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: At 7:00 AM this morning, more than 600 Japanese infantry, over 100 cavalry, and more than 10 artillery pieces advanced from southeast of Conghua towards Dagan Yu and other places, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army for several hours, leading to hand-to-hand combat at noon. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: On the morning of the 15th, the Chinese army surrounded and fiercely attacked the Japanese troops who had fled south from Zengcheng to Shitan. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in Shitan moved north to reinforce and fled to Tingzigang, southwest of Zengcheng, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. The Chinese army was prepared and did not succeed. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: This morning, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Shangang from the west of Conghua. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in the suburbs of Nanchang City. Now, the large Chinese army is approaching Yuntang, and the Japanese army is extremely alarmed. It is heard that over a thousand Japanese troops stationed in Nanchang City are plundering civilian property and slaughtering the people. Many corpses are exposed on both sides of Zhongshan Road, Zhongzheng Road, and Guohuo Road, and no one has buried them yet. The situation is extremely tragic. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: More than a thousand Japanese troops on the north bank of the Xiu River, with four artillery pieces, engaged in fierce fighting with a certain Chinese unit in Yinkang, west of Wuning, on the morning of the 10th.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US President's Appeal to the European Situation</h3>
<p>"Reversing the impending disaster, serving as a cornerstone for peace," what kind of spirit, what kind of power, what kind of hardship, what kind of merit is this? But how can it adequately describe the great harvest expected by US President Roosevelt in the telegram he issued yesterday? Tens of millions of flesh and blood beings, endowed with reason, will be sacrificed under the relentless fire of cannons; tens of millions upon millions of assets and material resources will be reduced to smoke and clouds, will become ashes; moreover, indirectly losing their happiness, losing their livelihood, losing their lives because of this, the number cannot be estimated. Pressured by this reality, the calamity is imminent, and the world's anxiety is not a matter of a day or two. Or perhaps it is not considered so, merely because it has not yet happened; not with reason, not with guarantee, can one say that it will certainly not happen. Just consider: there are those who, taking advantage of opportune moments, support authority, and will cast aside the fundamental principles of civilization cultivated and created by humanity for thousands of years, such as freedom, justice, benevolence, forgiveness, honesty, and righteousness, not only like discarded rags, but also destroy them with all their might; they are jealous of other countries that maintain civilized principles, attempting to blindly coerce them to follow; they use racial concepts to expand their power, while forcibly annexing other ethnic groups; they regard diplomatic negotiations as useless methods, and use force as the only way to solve international problems and achieve their own desires; they make promises lightly, treating them as mere words; they hate treaties, regarding them as shackles; they consider coercion as a legitimate desire, and aggression as a legitimate right; they build up their military, brandishing their power and displaying their might; if one were to say that this does not harm human peace, international order, and that they can ultimately live in peace without going to war, who can believe it? The general trend indicates that war is only a matter of time, and recent events especially show that time cannot be delayed much longer, and war is imminent. The arms race, scrambling in fear of falling behind, is indeed a clear prelude to the outbreak of war; and the concentration of troops, the patrolling of fleets, the doubling of standing armies, the conscription of reserves, the rush to build barriers on the borders, and the declaration of martial law in military zones; all these actions are like drawing back the bow, poised and ready to fire, already facing each other at close range, with the outbreak of conflict only a moment away. Truly, if not for President Roosevelt's telegram appeal, one could not believe that there was still a shred of hope to avoid the great calamity.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's telegram to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the contents of which have already been published in yesterday's and today's newspapers, with a heart of compassion for humanity, makes an appeal to cease fighting. As of today, it can be regarded as the gospel in the greatest crisis concerning the largest number of people in history. He discusses the state of aggression, saying that in Europe, three countries have lost their independence, and in Africa, one country has lost its independence. In the Far East, a vast territory of an independent country has been occupied by its neighbor, and according to rumors, certain other independent countries are in danger of being invaded. He discusses the consequences of war, saying that regardless of whether they are victors, defeated countries, or neutral countries, all will suffer pain, and the impact will extend to future generations in all countries of the world. He discusses the right and wrong of war, only praising those who fight to defend their homeland: otherwise, he asserts that there is absolutely no reason, and politicians have no right to drive people to fight. He asks Germany and Italy if they can provide a guarantee of non-aggression, listing thirty countries as targets, hoping for a period from ten to twenty-five years. His comfort to Germany and Italy is to discuss the two issues of limiting armaments and promoting trade in an atmosphere of peace. His conclusion is that the pivot of current fortune and misfortune lies with the authorities of each country; and the responsibility for the war in the future cannot escape historical praise or blame. True insights, ultimate truths, incisive analysis, a magnificent spirit; and his statement that his motivation is not based on selfish thoughts or cowardice, especially shows that America's boundless spirit and material strength not only have the vision to span the Atlantic Ocean, but also fill the entire world.</p>
<p>However, can President Roosevelt, and indeed civilized humanity, obtain the harvest expected from this telegram, and the hope for avoiding the great calamity? As of today, this telegram is truly the greatest gospel, but is its value limited to a historical document, or does it have an objective function? According to a Washington dispatch yesterday, the US government is not very optimistic; and to prevent unforeseen events, it has already taken necessary measures; at the same time, the fleet conducting exercises in the Atlantic is about to sail back to the Pacific. The reporter does not want to infer from this the confidence of the United States in issuing this appeal, but the severity of the European situation can be glimpsed even more. As for Germany and Italy, as the main actors in the severity of the European situation, if they sincerely accept good words and change their plans, they can certainly make the serious European situation take a sharp turn for the better; but as of the time the reporter held the pen, only heard cold-blooded retorts from the German and Italian people, seeming not to pay the slightest attention to President Roosevelt's painstaking efforts. The future is not optimistic, this is one proof. And the German and Italian authorities have not yet made a formal statement. What their intentions are cannot be predicted; saying that their response is the opposite of what was expected and hoped for is not unexpected either.</p>
<p>From any point of view, we all hope that Germany and Italy will pull back from the precipice and make good use of President Roosevelt's appeal, taking it as an easy path to transition from military action to diplomacy. The situation has become so turbulent today that the outbreak of war is only a moment away, which is also the last moment to change and follow the easy path of diplomacy. Without such a plan, war will immediately follow. What is worrying is that, given the way Hitler and Mussolini have historically dealt with international affairs, and their policies of encouraging the people, they probably also have their political reasons. Failing to allow for changes with sharp angles; if they do not change and go their own way, not only will the British-French axis in Europe gradually take shape, but also American public opinion will become more sympathetic to Britain and France due to the ineffectiveness of their president's appeal. Therefore, President Roosevelt's telegram, regardless of the purity of its motives, is beyond doubt, but its possible outcome, on the one hand, has the hope of reversing the European situation and becoming a cornerstone of peace, with the United States truly being the "intermediary" it claims to be; on the other hand, it may also, due to the stubbornness of Germany and Italy, promote the strengthening and expansion of the democratic group, and the rapid transformation of the United States into an insider is an extremely rapid and inevitable trend.</p>
<h3>Chinese Air Force is Undergoing Thorough Reorganization; Patterson Going to the US to Purchase New Aircraft</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) Mr. Patterson, the Chinese representative of United Airlines, stated that all of China's air force is currently undergoing a thorough reorganization and will soon become a powerful new air force.

He declined to disclose the details and total number of the new aircraft, and even declined to specify how the aircraft would be transported to China. According to the staff member, after obtaining new loans from the UK and the US in China, a large number of aircraft have been ordered abroad, including an order manufactured by aircraft factories in the US and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Market in Huangchuan Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Huangchuan: At the beginning of the month, the reporter departed from a certain place in northern Hubei, broke through the Japanese warning line, crossed the Peiping-Hankow Railway at a certain place, and arrived in southeastern Hubei. After a seven-day journey, I safely arrived in Huangchuan County today. Huangchuan fell to the Japanese last September and was recaptured by a certain guerrilla detachment of a certain war zone of the Chinese army after seventy days. When the Japanese army retreated, they left behind many corpses and military supplies. After the Chinese army entered the city and reorganized for many days, they finally buried all the corpses, actively restored public order, comforted refugees, reorganized the Baojia system, trained strong men, and eliminated traitors. The results of all major efforts are very good. At present, half of the residents in the city have returned, and the market has recovered to the situation before the war. Today, the reporter toured the streets of the north and south cities. Although there is already a sign of revival on the rubble piles, broken tiles and dilapidated walls are everywhere. In the villages within a few miles of the suburbs, broken walls and ruins, and bullet marks are like beehives. Having experienced this catastrophe, the residents feel even more determined to fight the enemy with hatred, unite to resist foreign aggression, and cooperate closely between the military and the people, occasionally attacking the Japanese army, causing the Japanese army to be unable to attend to all fronts.

<h3>Puppet Sui Jing (Pacification) Committee in Bian (Kaifeng) Attacked; Japan Attaches Great Importance</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Kaifeng puppet Sui Jing Committee was attacked during the inauguration ceremony on the 9th.

<h3>Puppet Manchukuo Bans Soybean Oil Exports</h3>
<p>(Peiping) According to sources from the occupied Chinese territories, "Manchukuo" has banned the export of soybeans and soybean oil to China. The Central Bank of "Manchukuo" has received orders from the "Manchukuo" government not to approve applications for exporting such products. It is said that the reason is to increase the prices of these two commodities in "Manchukuo". Another reason is that soybeans and soybean oil are often transported to Tianjin and then to Shanghai for export abroad. This measure can prevent foreign merchants in Tianjin from profiting from foreign exchange. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Japan and Germany and Italy Negotiate Military Hardware Exchange Agreement: A Substitute for the Tripartite Military Alliance; Arita's Diplomacy Wavering</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to enhance the Anti-Comintern Pact in large quantities, Japan is negotiating an agreement with Germany and Italy to exchange aircraft, military hardware, and manufacturing rights as a substitute for the tripartite military alliance. Although the details of Japan's proposal are kept secret, according to the Associated Press, which learned from Japanese government sources, Japan's expectations are: (1) to obtain Italy's latest aircraft; (2) to obtain German military hardware; (3) to hope that Germany will allow Japan to establish aircraft factories in Germany so that they can manufacture aircraft exclusively for Japan, and at the same time, the Japanese can use this opportunity to learn and establish an independent foundation for Japan's aircraft industry. On the other hand, the conditions that Japan offers to Germany in exchange are its willingness to grant Germany considerable concessions and rights in China. However, there are several points that Germany and Italy find difficult to satisfy: (1) Italy is quite hesitant to supply Japan with its latest aircraft, and even if it does, it must be a cash transaction; (2) Although Germany is willing to allow Japanese to operate some aircraft factories, it is only willing to transfer old-style factories to the Japanese, not new-style factories; (3) Both sides want to obtain foreign exchange and are reluctant to part with goods easily. Therefore, the agreement is difficult to conclude for the time being. Furthermore, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Ambassador to Germany Hiroshi Oshima are trying to strengthen the relations between Germany, Italy, and Japan, but they do not receive the support of the Japanese government. Hiroshi Oshima has a preliminary agreement with Germany on military cooperation and is quite unpopular with Tokyo. If Hiroshi Oshima were not a general, he would have been recalled to Japan long ago. One of the reasons why Japan does not want to establish a military alliance with Germany and Italy is the thorny issue of fishery rights with the Soviet Union. Although this issue was later resolved, Japan's compromising attitude was clearly visible. The reason is that Japan would rather sacrifice fishing rights than go to war with the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japan is also trying to coordinate with Britain and the United States, and therefore does not want to conclude an anti-democratic military alliance with Germany.

We will work and fight together with all the Soviet people to make the Soviet Union an even stronger and victorious force in the struggle to thoroughly build communism. The miners of the Donets Basin, upon receiving the orders of the Party and the government, will immediately rise up and stand at the forefront of the soldiers defending the socialist motherland, like a steel wall."

<h3>US Ambassador to China to Return to Post Next Month</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news last night, the US Ambassador to China, Johnson, is scheduled to go to China on September 1 to resume his post. In recent days, there have been rumors that American businessmen in China have expressed opposition to Johnson, but after the announcement of this news, the above-mentioned theories have been refuted. Well-informed sources have denied that Johnson's return to China is related to the movement of the US Navy but admit that Johnson's sudden return to China must be related to the increasing tension between the US and Japan. It is understood that Johnson is currently on vacation in the US at Bainbridge Island. The State Department also said that before returning to China, Johnson will have to go to Washington to discuss everything with Hull. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Army Prepares for Autumn Maneuvers</h3>
<p>250,000 Troops to Participate; Airborne Troop Transport to be Tested</p>
<p>(London) Britain's largest military review is about to be held in the autumn. It is said that War Secretary Hore-Belisha will issue orders that all British troops should gather at Tidworth to participate in the review, so that the exercises can be completely similar to actual warfare. The new mechanized units of the British Army will also begin testing during the next exercises. Both armies will have fighter jets to assist in combat, using smoke screens instead of poison gas, and will use giant aircraft to transport troops from one line to another, allowing troops to use parachutes to practice various landings behind enemy lines. Cooperation from local units alone is expected to involve 250,000 people in the activities. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Loud Appeal; Democratic Countries Respond Unanimously; British Court Fully Agrees with the Proposal; Key to War and Peace Depends on the Attitudes of Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt sent telegrams to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the biggest impression here is that the President earnestly hopes that mankind can avoid the scourge of war. The President read the original telegram to reporters today, explaining it paragraph by paragraph. When he read the passage "After war breaks out, all countries in the world, regardless of whether they are victorious, defeated, or neutral, will suffer," he paid particular attention to the words "neutral countries," saying that his reason for sending this telegram was out of concern for the neutral countries. All the nations of the world, including those of totalitarian states, fear war, which can be said to be a common sentiment. When he read the paragraph about convening a conference, he said that the United States could only participate in economic and disarmament conferences, not political conferences. All matters of determining boundaries and other political issues should be left to the directly related countries to discuss among themselves. Speakers interpreted this by saying that the President made this statement to dispel the doubts of isolationists who insist that the United States should not be politically responsible for European countries. Later, the President said that he regarded himself as a "middleman," not a "mediator," and only wanted to serve as a messenger between the related countries. Speakers further explained that the President's words were still intended to silence the isolationists and avoid criticism. Finally, when the President read the names of the independent countries listed in the original telegram, he said that all related countries were included, so that they would all benefit when German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini provided guarantees. The President also said that he had not exchanged views with any government before sending this telegram, only informing the governments of Latin American countries separately afterward. He had originally considered this weeks ago, but because the incidents in Czechoslovakia and Albania occurred one after another, quickly becoming faits accomplis, he waited until now, when the situation had not become tense again, before taking action. As for his motivation, it can be summarized in one sentence: the United States will never miss any opportunity to avoid war. He made up his mind, so he called Secretary of State Hull for a meeting to draft the telegram, and after they were sent separately, he went to bed peacefully. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax, on behalf of the British government, warmly welcomed President Roosevelt's actions and issued a statement saying that the British government fully agrees with President Roosevelt's assessment of the international situation. They said, "We believe that President Roosevelt, driven by the impetus of a true statesman, has presented a genuine opportunity to save Europe from the war that all are concerned about. We must now await the replies from Germany and Italy. The British government wishes to express its hope here that the replies from Germany and Italy can open the door for carrying out the steps mentioned by President Roosevelt." (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After reading President Roosevelt's telegram, Premier Daladier immediately sent a note to the US Ambassador, Bullitt, asking him to convey it to his government. The contents briefly stated that the French government agrees with President Roosevelt's proposals without reservation. France is committed to all ideas of freedom, human solidarity, and maintaining peace within the independent scope of each country. He has already expressed this idea in his radio address on the 29th of last month, and the statements issued by the British and French authorities on the 13th of this month. In addition, all sectors in France warmly welcome President Roosevelt's telegram, saying that it is a practical contribution by President Roosevelt to world peace. French officials also said that the anti-aggression movement of Britain and France has been supported spiritually by the United States, as can be seen from President Roosevelt's listing of European countries requiring Germany and Italy to respect independence. It is hoped that Germany and Italy can accept with sincerity, as Britain and France have done. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Nine Latin American countries have sent telegrams to the US State Department, stating their support for President Roosevelt's telegram to Germany and Italy. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Argentina: After US President Roosevelt sent telegrams to German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night, Argentine President Ortiz replied to President Roosevelt with a long telegram, which stated, "The wishes and ideals that Your Excellency has revealed are fully supported by the people of our country. The relationship between our country and its neighboring countries has always been based on maintaining peace and respecting international law. Your Excellency has previously made assertions based on the noble moral principles embraced by the nations of North and South America, which are sincerely supported by the people of our country. Although our two countries can stay out of the European disputes, there are various close relationships between us and the Old World, so our country shares the concerns shown in the telegram. In short, Your Excellency's noble desire to promote peace is fully agreed upon by the people of our country, which is what I wish to represent in reply." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Canada: People here praise President Roosevelt's appeal to the dictators as a bold and candid act. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The American President's telegram to Germany and Italy has been uniformly reprinted and endorsed by the local newspapers. Political figures also said that President Roosevelt's benevolent words may not be heeded by the dictators of Germany and Italy. Even if they submit a reply, it must be insincere. At a time when the world is threatened, President Roosevelt's move can be said to be timely, and the organization of the European anti-aggression group will be accelerated as a result. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: People in the local government commented that Germany may not agree with the methods proposed by President Roosevelt, so it is doubtful whether they can be implemented. The newspapers said that if leader Hitler wants to maintain peace, he must agree to hold negotiations. The evening newspaper reported that President Roosevelt's move was mainly for domestic consumption, intending to inform public opinion that he had exhausted all means to avoid war. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3>British Government and Public Opinion Comment</h3>
<p>Opening a Path to Avert War; Britain Cannot Afford to Neglect Defense</p>
<p>(London) Today, all British newspapers published President Roosevelt's historic telegram to Hitler and Mussolini in extra-large type, which shows the importance Britain attaches to President Roosevelt's intervention in European affairs. However, the various hopes aroused last night were weakened by the news from Berlin that German officials were treating President Roosevelt's proposals with indifference. The news that the United States had ordered all ships of the Atlantic Fleet to immediately sail to the Pacific was published in a less prominent position than President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler and Mussolini. The "Sunday Observer" published an editorial today, stating that this century has twice heard major challenges to freedom, both originating in Central Europe, and both exerting the same influence 3,000 miles away, across the Atlantic Ocean. The "Sunday Times" editorial said that the whole world is now eagerly awaiting the replies from Hitler and Mussolini, but some people say that it is better for the two to not reply at all than to make empty promises that they have absolutely no intention of keeping. The "Sunday Dispatch" stated that President Roosevelt's telegram could be listed as one of the greatest services to his compatriots in history. The "Sunday Express" expressed the opinion that if Hitler and Mussolini reject President Roosevelt's appeal, the United States will likely amend the Neutrality Act to favor the countries under aggression. The "Sunday Observer" also published an article by Gavin, stating that the current situation is almost as serious as the crisis last September. If we can arrange ourselves well in the next few weeks, we may breathe the air of peace for a long period of time, but no one dares to say what will change in the next few weeks. The best way to prevent disaster is to prepare to deal with it and make it clear so that those who dare to commit great wrongs can see it. He also said that we must pay special attention to the danger of the other side suddenly seizing key locations, whether in the East or West, or taking other armed violent actions. It is expected that 250,000 people can participate in the activities only through the cooperation of local troops. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Lloyd George, a senior figure in British politics, called President Roosevelt's telegram to the dictators "a solemn and significant appeal in reason." Opposition leader Attlee also called it "a valuable initiative." The opinions of the two can represent a glimpse of the national approval in Britain. Newspaper commentators have greatly admired the straightforward remarks in President Roosevelt's telegram, such as "You have repeatedly stated that you and the people of your country do not want war. If this is indeed the case, then there is no need for war," praising it as a concise expression of an undeniable fact. In addition, more attention was paid to a passage in President Roosevelt's telegram, which stated that people hope that their fears can be ended, but unfortunately, it is necessary to recognize various new facts. Three countries in Europe and one in Africa have lost their independence and been destroyed. In the Far East, another independent country has also had a large territory occupied by its neighbors. The news that we believe to be inaccurate insists that there are still plans to continue to carry out aggressive actions against other independent countries. Therefore, the world is now moving towards a dangerous period, unless there is a more reasonable way to be the compass for all things, the situation will inevitably end in disaster. At the time of issuing this statement, it is solemnly declared that the people of the United States are not speaking out of selfishness or cowardice, but with the power of human strength and friendship. International problems can be resolved at the conference table, but in the conference room, like in a courtroom, discussions must be sincere if both parties are to gain real benefits. President Roosevelt also asked, after explaining that the United States was willing to mediate amicably because it was not involved in the immediate dispute, "Are you willing to guarantee that the troops of your country will not attack or invade the territory or dependencies of the following independent countries?" (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Attitude is Cold</h3>
<p>Hitler Studies the Telegram in Detail and Exchanges Views with Italy</p>
<p>(Berlin) The telegram sent by the US President was immediately forwarded to Munich and presented to Hitler for reading. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other key members of the German government are currently in Munich. The telegram is being studied. It is understood that Hitler will first contact Mussolini before replying. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler and Ribbentrop both arrived in Munich this afternoon. It is said that they are currently discussing the US President's telegram. Translators are working hard to translate the full text of the telegram into German, which was only completed in the evening. Officials did not make any criticism of it and would not allow any indication as to whether the full text of the telegram would be published. The "Sunday Morning News" did not carry any news about the US President's telegram, but many Germans have learned of the matter by listening to the British external broadcasts. Whether or not there is a basis for the rumors that Germany will occupy Danzig, there is no reliable news. Currently, the only important figure remaining in Berlin is Propaganda Minister Goebbels. According to Reuters, the US President's telegram has not caused excessive surprise, as officials say that Munich has neither convened meetings nor has special activities. It is not planned to publish a communique regarding the US President's telegram tonight. It is said that Hitler may not return to Berlin before Tuesday. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable reports, Hitler has decided to resist President Roosevelt's appeal for guarantees of non-aggression within ten years to respect the territorial integrity of Europe and the Near East. It is said that this decision was issued after consultations between Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Also, Hitler discussed everything with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini by telephone. It is expected that Germany and Italy will adopt the same attitude towards the US peace plan. National Socialist Party officials reported that Hitler may not formally reject the US President's proposal, but simply ignore it. The Propaganda Department is unwilling to confirm the reports that the leader has rejected the proposal but admits that there is indeed a possibility of German rejection. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Wilson's Fourteen Points: The Germans Still Can't Forget</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After U.S. President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Führer Hitler, political figures here generally treated it with indifference and made humorous remarks, saying that the telegram was obviously misdirected. Germany had already gained experience regarding the roundtable discussion method, and only after abandoning this method did it become as strong as it is today. Moreover, the fourteen points previously proposed by the late U.S. President Wilson, what was their actual effect? The German side has not been able to forget it. If a roundtable conference were held at this time, there would be many issues for various countries to discuss, and it would be difficult to find solutions in reality. In addition, certain theoretical issues (referring to Bolshevism) are extremely sharp. Germany is not comfortable sitting at the same table with people whose theories are so different. However, German officials refused to express their opinions before Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini exchanged views, only saying that this matter requires important diplomatic negotiations. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Unwavering Anti-Communist Stance, Claiming Telegram Was Misdirected</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the content of the telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt, the German News Agency briefly released a summary at 10:20 PM today. Its tone was very short. The semi-official German News Agency refuted it, saying, "It is common for President Roosevelt to regard himself as the late President Wilson. His usual trick is nothing more than to provoke other nations to feel uneasy, and then claim to be a messenger of peace. In short, he wants to advocate for the restoration of human happiness after causing world panic, and promote peace after creating a war mentality. His intention is probably to shift the world's attention from totalitarian countries, so as to cover up the propaganda campaigns full of hatred in democratic countries, and because the encirclement policy promoted by certain countries has already caused repercussions, he wants to dispel them. Based on past experience, we are skeptical of this kind of political action by the U.S. President, and there is no reason to be surprised. As for convening a roundtable conference to try to satisfy the vital needs of a great nation, it will also lead to a tragic situation, because various fundamental issues cannot be discussed purely from a legal point of view. In addition, there is one point that President Roosevelt has overlooked, namely the ideological struggle. There is an international destructive force that wants to plunge nations into bloody turmoil and threaten the world order. If this force is allowed to have a safe haven in a certain country and stabilize its position, in other words, if Bolshevism is allowed to enjoy equal rights in world politics, then an enduring and satisfactory situation will not be established internationally for a single day. The so-called roundtable conference will not be able to create a new order. This telegram from President Roosevelt must be misdirected. The strength and wisdom of the German nation have progressed, and it will never allow the victory that the late U.S. President Wilson once achieved to be seen again in President Roosevelt's proposals today. It can be asserted that Germany will reject it." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Rome Remains Silent for Now, Mussolini in Secret Talks with Göring</h3>
<p>Demands of Impoverished Nations</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the telegram sent by U.S. President Roosevelt, officials here refuse to express their opinions until Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler have jointly decided on a stance. The telegram has not been made public either. As of now, only leaders from both the party and government know about it. Party officials also said that any initiative that seeks to consolidate peace is welcomed by Italy, but unless the desires of "impoverished nations" are satisfied, fair peace will not materialize. In short, if various pending international issues are not resolved, and if the legitimate demands of Germany and Italy are not met, then President Roosevelt's proposed general agreement will not be realized. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will study President Roosevelt's telegram very closely. Today, the Prime Minister is in close contact with German Aviation Minister General Göring, who is visiting Rome. The Prime Minister met with Göring for twenty minutes after the parliamentary session and went to the palace together for lunch with the King of Italy. Few people in Rome are aware of the U.S. President's telegram. Government officials claim to be unaware of the U.S. President's telegram. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian political circles consider President Roosevelt's telegram to be a very generous gesture, but they feel that it may be inappropriate to publish the telegram before the recipients have had time to calmly consider and respond. At the very least, the promise of ten years of peace is indeed touching, but political circles feel that a world conference is unlikely to produce good results until Italy's demands on France have been satisfied. Ordinary Italians undoubtedly have a good impression of the U.S. President's move. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Policy Still Based on the Axis</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano stated in a speech to the Fascist Parliament today that Albania had suffered oppression, and only a few people would be surprised by its turn to Italy. Now Albania has automatically shaken off the tyranny of the Middle Ages. King Zog asked the Italian government to send troops to attack Yugoslavia, but the Italian government refused because of the good relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. Such an action would be foolish. When the Italian army landed, only a few disgruntled individuals resisted. Only a few people criticized what was in fact a remarkable military operation. Ciano denied the rumors of bombing Durazzo, Vlora, and other towns. His remarks criticizing the democratic powers were repeatedly interrupted by cheers. Ciano continued, saying that any attempt to undermine the Italian-Albanian union would be met with action by both countries. The Rome-Berlin Axis will continue to function well, and Italian foreign policy is still based on the Axis. The presence of Italian troops in Albania is by no means a threat to Yugoslavia. Ciano agreed with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks about maintaining the Anglo-Italian Agreement, saying that no facts have emerged to prove that this agreement should be changed. On our part, we believe that the Anglo-Italian Agreement established in April of last year is of great value. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Mummy Preserved for Seventy-Eight Years, Curly Hair and Rosy Cheeks as if Alive</h3>
<p>Budapest. Here, the mummy of a six-year-old child lies in a glass coffin in a museum. This year marks its eighty-fourth birthday. According to reports, this mummy is the son of Alan, a famous anatomist from the former University of Budapest. After this child died at the age of six, Alan preserved his body using a special method. After seventy-eight years, the corpse still has curly hair and rosy cheeks, as if alive. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Göring's Speech: The Solidarity of the Axis Powers Will Endure</h3>
<p>(Rome) General Göring paid a visit to Italian King Vittorio Emanuele, speaking for three quarters of an hour. Göring conveyed congratulations on behalf of Hitler, saying that the resolution of the Albanian issue was exceptionally smooth and cause for celebration. Yesterday afternoon, Göring attended a public banquet for the leaders of the Fascist Party's provinces at the invitation of Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace. In his speech, Göring explained in detail the thoroughness of the German and Italian revolutions and the significance of the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party fighting together under the leadership of great men. It is said that the friendship between Germany and Italy is not only based on political interests but also has deeply rooted special relations. The basic ideas of the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party are as mutually attractive as magnets and as harmonious as water and milk. From this perspective, the solidarity of the Axis powers will endure and the prosperity of both countries is just beginning. (Haitong, 16th)</p>

<h3>120 U.S. Warships Ordered Back to the Pacific, No Less Than a Warning to Japan Not to Act Rashly, U.S. Deeply Concerned About the Security of the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, U.S. authorities ordered the U.S. fleet to immediately return to the Pacific. This order was issued two hours after President Roosevelt called for peace from the totalitarian countries of Europe. The government took this action due to the tense situation in Europe, believing that it was necessary to concentrate the fleet in the Pacific to prevent sudden incidents in the Pacific. All U.S. fleets, except for the new Atlantic Fleet, five cruisers, six submarines, and one aircraft carrier, received orders to "return to the Pacific's usual operating area." These warships will set sail for the Pacific as soon as they are refueled. According to observers here, the British navy has been fully concentrated in the European waters, so that it can join the battle once war breaks out. The scope of this order includes as many as 120 warships. According to the Navy's calculations, it will take about three days to refuel each ship, and about thirteen or fourteen days to sail from the East Coast to the West Coast (Pacific). About sixteen warships will still remain along the Atlantic coast to participate in the New York World's Fair. At the same time, the special review in Norfolk may still be held as usual, but the scale will not be as large as previously planned. The U.S. fleet sailed through the Panama Canal into the Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea in February for large-scale exercises. President Roosevelt also went with the fleet to observe. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to information obtained by the Associated Press today, the United States has now obtained various intelligence reports, all of which indicate that once a drastic change occurs in the international situation, it will involve the Far East situation and threaten the interests of the United States. Therefore, the U.S. fleet has suddenly been concentrated in the Pacific. According to official statements, after the changes in the European situation, Japan will take actions in the East Indies that echo those of Italy, which will not only seriously threaten the United States with material supplies, but also endanger the security of the Philippines. According to naval circles, the main force of the U.S. fleet will temporarily remain in the Pacific coast area. Except for a small number of submarines and a small number of warships based in Hawaii, they will not sail west of Hawaii for the time being. According to observations from diplomatic circles, the U.S. Navy's decision to mobilize occurred at the same time as the warning to Germany and Italy. Its significance is to warn certain countries not to continue their aggression. According to well-informed sources, Japan must be wary of this action by the United States, because Japan's current strength is being used in China, and it will definitely be unable to cope with threats from other countries, especially the American people's determination to use the U.S. Navy to deal with Japan.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Seek Military Cooperation with the Soviet Union to Resist Aggression, Negotiations Make Significant Progress, Scope of Agreement Not Limited to Sky Plan</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently announced that after British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds held talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov yesterday, an agreement in principle was reached on the issue of guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Romania. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the organization of a collective security system, officials here recently announced that after Foreign Minister Bonnet held talks with Soviet Ambassador Suritz this afternoon, significant progress has been made on the issue of Soviet participation. Several issues have been effectively resolved, and solutions to the remaining issues can also be found in a short period. It is possible that France and the Soviet Union will reach an agreement by the 17th of this month. It is rumored that the proposed conventions are not limited to the "sky agreement," and a separate agreement will be drafted to stipulate that the Soviet Union should supply military equipment and raw materials when Poland and Romania are invaded. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) While most people are focusing their attention on Hitler's response to Roosevelt's peace proposal, Britain and France have moved forward today to seek a three-way military alliance with the Soviet Union. It is said that the immediate goal of the British, French, and Soviet negotiations is to reach an agreement in the air force. Once war breaks out, the air forces of these three anti-aggression countries will come out to resist the totalitarian countries. If this air force agreement is concluded, the combined air force strength of the allied countries will have 6,500 aircraft, which is sufficient to fight against the 1,500 aircraft of the Rome-Berlin Axis air force. However, the main purpose of the recent negotiations is to establish a complete military alliance. If any one country is attacked, the other allies will have related obligations, and the agreement will take effect. Moreover, the purpose of Britain and France is to expand this military alliance to include all the small countries guaranteed by Britain, France, or the Soviet Union. Therefore, this military alliance will also include Poland, Greece, Romania, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and Turkey. British Ambassador to Moscow Seeds met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov yesterday. Although today is Sunday, it is expected that they will need to meet again. The contents of the meeting between the two ambassadors have not been officially announced, but it is believed that they are nothing more than cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union. France and the Soviet Union already have an agreement, but it can only be implemented after being debated by the League of Nations Council to resist aggression. Therefore, France still hopes to establish a separate automatic defense treaty with Moscow. Paris believes that with this new plan, if France can help Romania and Poland resist Germany's attack, then the Soviet Union will obviously come out to help. This new plan can also allow various weapons and military supplies to reach Poland and Romania. The war materials of Britain and France can also be transported to these countries through Soviet territory. The Soviet Ambassador to France is said to have been authorized to begin formal negotiations with France or to foreshadow the talks between French and Soviet military personnel in order to achieve the establishment of an automatic military alliance. It is believed that the Soviet Union is willing to establish a mutual assistance agreement that includes all "peace-loving countries." If this agreement can be concluded, the Scandinavian and Baltic regions will also be included, and Germany's route to the Soviet Union can be blocked. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt's Peace Appeal Telegram (Continued and Concluded)</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt telegraphed German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night (this telegram was forwarded by Secretary of State Hull), requesting guarantees to respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of European countries within ten years. The main points have been recorded in the previous telegram. The main parts of the original telegram are supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>President Roosevelt said, "The conference room is no different from the courtroom. The countries involved must provide guarantees, participate in good faith, and have the belief that justice will be achieved. When entering the conference room, they must first leave their weapons outside the door. Today, if governments can frankly declare their current and future policies, world peace can make great progress. I firmly believe that the United States is not involved in the disputes currently occurring in Europe. I am speaking to you purely out of a sense of responsibility and friendship with other countries. These countries are uneasy about the policies that the German and Italian governments will pursue in the future.</p>
<p>I hereby ask you, "Are you prepared to provide assurances that your country's forces will never be used to attack or invade independent countries, namely Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, the Irish Republic, France, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Arab States, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Iran? This guarantee applies not only to the present but also to the more distant future, so that all countries can use peaceful means to devote themselves to more regular work. I propose that you provide a guarantee that you will not engage in aggression for at least ten years. It would be even better if it were limited to twenty-five years. If your government can provide this guarantee, I will immediately notify the above governments and ask them to provide the same guarantee, and then forward it to you. Only with such mutual guarantees can the world have a chance to breathe." After this is done, I will propose discussing the two main issues of limiting armaments and promoting world trade in a peaceful atmosphere. At that time, the United States will also be happy to participate. "What I propose is that countries exchange views with each other through the most effective and quickest ways. Recently, countries around the world have been vying to expand their armaments, and the financial burden has been increasing, and the disaster of economic bankruptcy is becoming increasingly imminent. If this method can be used to exchange views, the crisis can be gradually overcome without a doubt. Not only that, the U.S. government is prepared to participate in any negotiations aimed at finding the most practical ways to open up international trade, so that all countries can buy and sell goods in the world market on an equal footing, and at the same time purchase the necessary raw materials and finished products to maintain a peaceful life. Regarding this, all governments other than the United States that are directly related can carry out the necessary negotiations when the opportunity arises. In short, the current problem facing mankind is very complicated, as we have admitted, but we can continue to discuss and investigate it calmly in a peaceful atmosphere. On the contrary, if international talks are forced to take place under the threat of war, there is no peace to speak of. I hereby venture to speak frankly, hoping to be appreciated. The situation is so serious that the fate of all mankind in the coming years will depend on the actions of the governments. People of all countries want to avoid the scourge of war, and the authorities of all countries should not pretend to be deaf and blind. It must be known that if there is any deviation in the fate and happiness of all mankind, the responsibility will not be escaped from the criticism of history. It is hoped that the answer that you can propose will give all mankind a ray of light, dispel the fear and allow them to live and work in peace for the next few years, then it will be fortunate." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Good Impression Among U.S. Congressional Figures, Even Isolationists Praise</h3>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt telegraphed German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, it has caused a good impression in Congress. Even members who have always advocated isolationism, such as Democratic Congressman Ludlow, have praised it. Democratic Senator George, who recently asked the President to issue a declaration stating that the United States will never participate in the war, also told a Havas reporter, "Any initiative that is beneficial to business must also be beneficial to peace. The President's telegram yesterday is beneficial to both business and peace." The words of praise from government-affiliated members of Congress are even more inexhaustible. Democratic Senator Thomas, who recently introduced a bill proposing to give the President full power to distinguish between aggressor and aggressed countries, also told a Havas reporter, "The President's action can be seen in his repeated declarations. The telegram sent yesterday is particularly timely." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's appeal to Hitler and Mussolini has greatly shocked diplomatic circles, because this telegram may provoke opposition from Congress. According to reliable sources, the U.S. President and the Cabinet discussed the report of the U.S. intelligence agency, which indicated the possibility of some kind of aggressive action occurring within the next four or five days, and then took this action. Diplomatic circles doubt that the Axis powers can accept this condition without losing face. The U.S. President has now placed the responsibility for war and peace directly on the shoulders of Hitler and Mussolini. Diplomatic circles believe that even if this telegram fails to maintain peace, it can facilitate the President's foreign policy at home when war breaks out. This telegram can prove that the President has done everything possible to save the disaster of war, but the Axis powers still do not heed his call and resort to force. In this way, the American public's opposition to the Axis powers can become stronger. According to supporters of the government, President Roosevelt has placed himself in the position of world leader after sending this telegram and has become an international arbitrator. This is the highest stage that any U.S. President has reached since former President Wilson attended the peace conference. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Guarantee of Territorial Integrity, China Not Included in the List, Hu Shih Visits U.S. State Department to Inquire About Reasons</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih visited the State Department today, reportedly to inquire about why China was not included in the list of countries whose integrity the U.S. President wanted to guarantee. The State Department has given a mild reply, but the content has not been released. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Britain Defends the Mediterranean: Takes Various Precautions; Air Force Squadron Flies to Athens, Gibraltar Defenses Strengthened</h3>
<p>(London) Today, it has become clearer than before that Hitler may reject Roosevelt's peace appeal, so Britain continues to take all defensive precautions. A squadron of British aircraft, approximately twenty to thirty planes, has flown to the Tatoi airfield, located ten miles from Athens. This is another move by Britain to defend its position in the eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, British forces have buried landmines and set up obstacles on the important transportation routes from Spain to Gibraltar. At the same time, a defensive blockade line is being constructed in the port of Gibraltar. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the British War Office announced that the First Battalion of Wales would depart for Gibraltar on or after April 22nd. The British side believes that the British military's activities and measures in the Gibraltar area are routine precautions. However, the British government is indeed paying close attention to military actions in Spain. (Haitong Telegraph dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: According to reliable sources, troops stationed near here moved west this morning and are now stationed on the slopes of the Ronda Mountains in southern Spain. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Rabat, French Morocco, North Africa: A traveler from Spanish Morocco reports that military authorities there are actively constructing defensive fortifications in the area near the French Moroccan border. These fortifications are being supervised by foreign technicians and require substantial funding. Certain areas are prohibited to tourists for photography. Local natives and even military personnel of Spanish nationality have expressed unease, fearing that the area, after three years of civil war, will become a new battlefield. Furthermore, the natives there are dissatisfied with the fact that Italian troops have not withdrawn after the end of the civil war, and also because a large number of German warships are about to sail to and patrol Spanish waters. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Tunis, French North Africa: A traveler from the Italian colony of Libya reports that from the 2nd to the 8th of this month, Italian troops landed at the port of Suesara and moved to the area near the Tunisian border, numbering no less than ten thousand. The majority of them are native soldiers from Somaliland and Abyssinia in East Africa. The Libyan authorities are also conscripting natives in the Fezzan region, ordering them to build defensive fortifications in the border area, but most of the natives have fled into the mountains to avoid labor service. Furthermore, since Italy occupied Albania, the Libyan natives have boycotted stores run by Italians. There have even been frequent instances of native soldiers disobeying orders.

<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Invited to Visit Berlin: The Significance of This Trip Is Significant</h3>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Gafencu, accompanied by Secretary-General Baralifescu, departed at 1:20 PM today for a visit to Germany. He is scheduled to stay in Berlin for two days, and then travel to the four countries of England, France, Belgium and Italy. Wherever he goes, he will hold important talks with the governments of those countries. Political figures here have commented that Foreign Minister Gafencu is visiting Germany after the signing of the German-Romanian trade agreement, likely with the intention of seeking guarantees for Romania's independent sovereignty and territorial integrity. His talks with Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will certainly be extraordinarily important. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: According to news today, King Carol of Romania and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia will meet tomorrow on a ship in the Black Sea. King Boris of Bulgaria will also participate in the meeting to discuss European international issues. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Rumors Rampant in the Western Hemisphere: Germany Plans to Annex Danzig; The U.S. Authorities Are Quite Concerned About the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt convened a special meeting of foreign policy advisors this morning. Senator Pittman and other diplomatic experts were summoned to the White House. Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles arrived at the meeting first. As the White House convened this meeting, Washington was disturbed by news published in Berlin newspapers regarding the alleged maltreatment of Germans in Polish Silesia. As a result, rumors that Hitler would attempt to annex Danzig became even more rampant. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A dispatch from Berlin states that Hitler may seize Danzig in the middle of next week, and the fact that President Roosevelt's telegram to the German and Italian authorities did not include Danzig on the list of countries is considered quite significant. U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Kirk in Moscow has been ordered to go to Berlin to fill the vacancy left by Counselor Dillen of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. It is not yet known whether U.S. Ambassador Wilson to Germany will return to his post before U.S.-German relations improve. Although President Roosevelt's telegram mentioned the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Austria, Albania, and Abyssinia, it does not imply that the United States diplomatically recognizes the conquest of these countries.

<h3>The Rising Tide of Resistance to Japan by Chinese Troops in Shandong</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle South of Linqu: Great Bloody Battle at Jiangyu; Over 500 Japanese and Puppet Troops Killed</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Airmail News: A radio message from Shandong on the morning of the 9th reports that Japanese troops in Shandong continue to launch large-scale attacks against Chinese forces. On the morning of the 29th of last month, Japanese and puppet troops from Linqu set out in three routes. One route consisted of over 200 puppet soldiers, invading westward and arriving at [blank] in the evening. Another route consisted of over 200 puppet soldiers, invading southward and arriving at Qingyatou, north of [blank] River. These two forces were for [blank] control on both flanks. Another force consisted of over 400 Japanese infantry, over 100 cavalry, over 200 puppet soldiers, eight artillery pieces, twenty machine guns, and 500 carts, advancing along the Yilin Highway. While crossing the [blank] River, they were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army. At 4:00 PM, they arrived at Xinzai, 30 li north of Jiangyu. On the morning of the 30th, the Chinese army lured the Japanese and puppet troops to Heikewa Xiayu, southwest of Xinzai. After two hours of fierce fighting, over 50 Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed. At 10:00 AM, the Japanese and puppet troops arrived at Zhaolingzi, north of Jiangyu, and engaged in a fierce battle with a platoon of the Chinese army's advance troops. Subsequently, the Chinese army utilized the terrain for concealment, and the Japanese and puppet troops fired dozens of artillery shells, but the Chinese army did not move. When the Japanese and puppet troops approached, the Chinese army opened fire with machine guns, killing over 50 enemy soldiers. The Japanese and puppet troops retreated in disarray to Changzhuang for reorganization, and then launched a concentrated artillery counterattack against the Chinese army and encircled them from both flanks. [Blank] defended steadfastly without retreating and killed dozens more enemy soldiers. The platoon also made a heroic sacrifice of 25 men. On the 31st, the Japanese and puppet troops gathered at Jiangyu, planning to invade southward the next morning. Jiangyu is divided into Dongyu and Xiyu, both of which have surrounding walls. At that time, there were about 600 Japanese and puppet soldiers in Dongyu and about 200 in Xiyu. The Chinese army attacked both villages simultaneously at dawn on the 1st of this month. At 5:00 AM, both villages were simultaneously breached by the Chinese army. A certain battalion commander of the Chinese army bared his chest and directed the attack, charging back and forth in Dongyu three times. One soldier single-handedly killed seven Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, over 40 Japanese and puppet soldiers were discovered in a courtyard. Two squads of Chinese soldiers threw hand grenades, killing all the Japanese and puppet soldiers in the courtyard. Later, Japanese and puppet troops from other locations rushed to assist, and the two squads of Chinese soldiers also made a complete sacrifice. In addition, a certain squad of the Chinese army killed over 30 Japanese and puppet soldiers outside the east gate and were later surrounded and sacrificed by the Japanese and puppet troops. Platoon Leader Ma Wenyuan of the Chinese army wielded his saber and killed the enemy, continuously hacking down nine Japanese and puppet soldiers. Ma also sustained seven wounds. Furthermore, Company Commander Wang Haichao of a certain company, after his entire company was sacrificed, still held a machine gun and killed many Japanese and puppet soldiers, eventually making a heroic sacrifice as well.</p>
<p>The battle situation in Xiyu was just as fierce as in Dongyu. After his entire company was sacrificed, Company Deputy Commander Yang Dengfu of the Chinese army, with several hundred guards, continuously hacked down several Japanese machine gunners. He was seriously wounded but still killed many before sacrificing himself for the country. In addition, Geng Jiqing, the machine gun company commander, led a squad to provide cover on a high ground southwest of Xiyu. When Japanese and puppet troops detoured from the Shahe River, over 40 of them were killed. The squad continued to advance to outside the west gate, but the machine gun malfunctioned, leading to the squad being surrounded by Japanese and puppet troops, and the entire squad was sacrificed. The company commander carried his gun to a ditch to repair it and was discovered and killed by Japanese troops. In this battle, the Chinese army fought fiercely with the Japanese and puppet troops for six hours, from morning until noon. The Chinese army killed over 500 Japanese and puppet soldiers, heroically sacrificing 18 company and platoon leaders and over 300 soldiers. This action thoroughly shattered the Japanese army's plan to mop up southern Shandong. Local people welcomed them with food and drink and would weep with emotion when speaking of the heroism of the Chinese army's resistance. (10th)</p>
<h3>Jinan Assassination Squad: Assassination of Two Important Traitors; Puppet Court President and Puppet Department Head Assassinated on the Same Day</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Airmail News: A radio message from a certain location in Shandong on the 9th reports that on February 10th, the Chinese army's assassination squad assassinated Hao Shuxuan, the puppet education department head, and Zhang Chaoji, the puppet high court president, in Jinan, causing traitors to be terrified and shocked. The details of the event are as follows:</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on February 10th, a person in charge of the assassination squad, accompanied by two squad members, each riding a bicycle under the guise of delivering gifts, arrived at the private residence of Zhang Chaoji, the puppet high court president, on Zhijinshi Street in Jinan. One person first had a guard at the front of the door monitor with his gun, and the two others, carrying gifts, passed through two courtyards and went straight to Zhang's bedroom. They woke Zhang from his sleep and immediately informed him that they had come to eliminate a traitor. As Zhang was panic-stricken, someone stabbed Zhang in the heart with a sharp knife, and Zhang fell to the ground and died. Someone then closed the room door, returned to the gatehouse, and called his companion to ride away, behaving with extreme composure. At the same time, another person in charge, accompanied by two squad members, rode bicycles to the private residence of Hao Shuxuan on Houponan Street in Dongguan, falsely claiming to be delivering gifts. Hao's guard said, "The department head is about to go to the office to work, no need to deliver gifts." As he spoke, Hao came out. Someone pretended that Hao had been a teacher at Jinan Zhengyi Middle School and told Hao that they were students from Zhengyi Middle School and had come to deliver gifts. Hao invited them to sit in the living room. As they sat down, one person talked with Hao, while the other pierced Hao's back with a sharp blade. Fresh blood gushed out, splattering someone's clothes. Unfortunately, the location was slightly off, not causing death. Hao yelled and ran. Someone, in a hurry, fired a shot, hitting Hao in the waist. He fell to the ground. At that time, the other person had already fled. Hao's guards, hearing the sound, rushed over and fired at someone, hitting his hand. Someone retaliated while trying to escape out the door. Under the east wall, he encountered over ten puppet security corps soldiers and Japanese soldiers. Someone then turned west towards the Huamei Hospital alleyway, where he encountered dozens of puppet police. Someone, realizing that there was no way out, loudly said, "Are you all Chinese? If you are Chinese, you should not block my way. If anyone blocks me, he is a traitor, and I will kill him first." While speaking, he pointed his gun at them. The police, stirred by righteousness, quickly retreated into the alley. Someone then rushed through Xin Dongmen and into the city. Inside the city, he encountered puppet police four or five times, but he lectured them on righteousness and safely passed through. When he reached a secluded street, he quickly took a rickshaw and fled. After this incident occurred, the Japanese army conducted a large-scale search, arresting and killing many patriotic youths. To this day, Jinan is under very strict security.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Military Discipline Inspection Team in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondence: The First Military Discipline Inspection Team, after arriving in Zhejiang for four months, has offered much criticism on various military and political matters in this province. The team left Jinhua for Jiangxi on the 5th of this month and issued the following statement before leaving. In addition to rectifying military discipline, the Military Discipline Inspection Team has also reported cases of corruption by civil and military officials. This time, the inspection of 41 counties in Zhejiang and the inspection of troops took up most of their energy. As a result, the work of reporting corruption could not be done thoroughly. However, anything they saw or heard would not be easily let go. For example, the cases of Wei Sicheng, the former director of the Highway Bureau and deputy director of the Transportation Office, Li Lusheng, the former deputy director of the Highway Bureau, and Qiu Yuanxiong, the former magistrate of Pinghu County, have been reported according to the law. The chairman of the committee replied on March 6th, stating that he had ordered Chairman Huang to detain Wei Sicheng, Li Lusheng, and Qiu Yuanxiong and hand them over to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command for strict handling. In addition, the case of Zhong Shijie, the magistrate of Fenghua County, who took bribes and condoned false accusations, has been transferred to the Provincial Security Command for submission to the provincial government for suspension of his duties for legal handling. In addition, the case of Chen Xian, the police chief of Dinghai, for extortion and bribery, has been referred to the provincial government for detention and legal handling. In addition, a total of 837 cases of corruption, illegality, and dereliction of duty reported by the people have been handled by the relevant authorities. The team still has an office at its original address, with committee member Liang Shangdong in charge. All cases reported by the people will continue to be received.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Policies in Fujian Province Over the Past Year: Focusing on the Two Goals of Concentrating Human Resources and Material Resources</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Xu Xueyu, an advisor to the provincial government, recently gave a talk on the political facilities established in Fujian Province over the past year. A summary of his talk is as follows:</p>
<p>The political facilities established in Fujian Province over the past year have been implemented with the two major goals of concentrating human resources and concentrating material resources. Regarding the concentration of human resources, it is to train the people and organize the people. The educational institutions are responsible for training the people, and the civil affairs institutions are responsible for organizing the people. The guides for training and organizing the people are (1) civil servants, (2) young students, and (3) baojia personnel. In other words, these three types of people are the cadres who train and organize the people. First, the cadres must be trained and organized well before we can talk about the issue of training and organizing the people. The process of training cadres is described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Training of Civil Servants: The training of civil servants began in the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] and intensified after the start of the War of Resistance. It can be divided into five categories: (1) Training of County and District Administrative Personnel: A County Administrative Personnel Training Institute has been established to be specifically responsible for training. Those trained are the section chiefs, staff members, school supervisors, directors of tax collection offices, tax collectors of county governments, and the district chiefs and staff members below the county governments. (2) Training of Construction Personnel: All types of technical personnel, such as agricultural and forestry personnel, civil engineering personnel, and weights and measures inspectors, are trained in classes set up in county training institutes. Also, because the highway development in this province has been rapid, a special Vehicle Affairs Personnel Training Institute has been established to train vehicle affairs personnel. (3) Training of Land Administration Personnel: The Land Administration Bureau has established a Land Administration Personnel Training Institute to train land administration personnel in preparation for organizing land throughout the province. (4) Training of Health Personnel: Higher-level midwifery schools and medical schools (recently upgraded to medical colleges) have been established to train doctors and midwives to improve the health of the people. (5) Training of Police Personnel: A Security Department Training Institute has been established to train officers of the security teams in various counties, and a Police Officer Training Institute has been established to train police officers of all levels to be responsible for maintaining order. In addition, there are also statistics classes to train talent to handle statistics in county governments, banking training classes to train staff for the Fujian Provincial Bank, and military law trial personnel training classes to train military law trial personnel in county governments. There are about 10,000 people being trained in the above categories, and they are assigned by the government to different positions.</p>
<p>(2) Training of Young Students: There have been two rounds of training for young students so far. The first group of students concentrated on training the people, in short, civil training. The second group of students concentrated on educating the people, in short, civil education. The first student civil training work was from January to May of the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. A total of 1,844 students were mobilized, and a General Team for Cadre Training of the People was formed. There were 1,609 male students, formed into ten companies, and 235 female students, formed into two companies. These were all high school or normal school students in their second year or above, simplified normal school students in their fourth year or above, and college students of all grades. They were concentrated in Fuzhou and received three weeks of cadre training, divided into military and political training groups. The second student civil education work followed the student training of the people. It was planned to establish 10,000 wartime people's schools throughout the province, to be completed within two years. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], 1,000 independent wartime people's schools were first set up, and 4,000 wartime people's schools were also attached to various primary schools, starting classes at the same time as the various primary schools. These people's schools mainly held adult classes for women, but children's classes could be added.</p>
<p>(3) Training of Baojia Personnel: The baojia system is the grassroots organization of townships and towns, and is also the lowest-level organization closest to the people. If this organization is not sound, no good political work can be promoted. To make the baojia system sound, sound members are needed. Therefore, in addition to (1) convening baojia chiefs and giving them training to enhance their intelligence, (2) generally holding short-term training, with bao chiefs trained by the county and jia chiefs trained by the district, with a portion of them drawn and trained in batches every six months, and (3) carefully selecting the candidates for baojia chiefs and rewarding the virtuous in the countryside to take office as baojia chiefs, and (4) appropriately increasing the funds for the baojia system, there is also a large-scale "Bao Training Integrated Cadre Training Institute" to transfer the joint bao directors of the entire province to the institute in stages for concentrated training, and after graduation, they will return to their original positions. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Xinghua Bans Rice Exports to Regulate Food Supply and Prevent Aiding the Enemy</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: Rice is the main product of Xingyi. In years of abundance, the people have enough food to be self-sufficient. Last year, the dam water caused a disaster, and the autumn harvest suffered a major loss. Refugees gathered, and the consumption increased again, leading to a decrease in the amount of rice in storage. Various merchants promised to transport it to Xinghua from outside, so as to make up for the deficiency, but some unscrupulous merchants, without considering the times and only seeking profit, not only took the opportunity to manipulate and raise prices, but also exported rice in large quantities to other counties, selling it and reselling it to aid the enemy, which is extremely abominable. In view of this, the county government, in order to regulate the food supply, both at the root and at the branches, specially organized a Rice Price Evaluation Committee to evaluate and set prices, so as to prevent arbitrary price increases. At the same time, it strictly prohibits the export of rice to curb the outflow, accumulate reserves, and issue public notices so that, if there is any deliberate violation, they will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Ministry of Education's Management of Chinese Film Education in Recent Years (1) – Remarkable Achievements in the Past Two Years, Actively Implementing the Six-Year Plan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Pan Chenghou, Secretary of the Film Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, recently compiled a report on the management of film education in recent years and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for record. The original report is very long. The following is an excerpt of the part concerning electrical education facilities:</p>
<p>In recent years, China's social education has become increasingly developed, and the promotion of electrical education has gradually become popular, from Mongolia in the north to Xinjiang in the west, and Yunnan and Guizhou in the south. This endeavor began with the establishment of the China Educational Film Association in 1932. In the autumn of 1936, the Ministry of Education established the Film Education Committee to take charge of advocacy and gradually carry it out. The Ministry of Education also formulated the "Six-Year Plan for Film Education," stipulating that within six years from 1936, it would complete the goal of establishing a film education mobile teaching area in every county and city in the country. It planned to establish 80 areas in 1936, 160 areas in 1937, 400 areas in 1938, 450 areas in each of the years 1939 and 1940, and 460 areas in 1941. According to this plan, 81 film education mobile teaching areas were established in various provinces and cities in 1936, with five areas each in Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces; four areas each in Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Shandong, Hebei, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces; two areas each in Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan provinces; two areas each in Ningxia, Guizhou, and Chahar provinces; and one area each in Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Qinghai (Hai), Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Weihai provinces, cities, and districts.</p>
<p>In 1936, the Ministry of Education provided full-fee subsidies to various provinces and cities for the purchase of machinery and equipment, including 18 projectors for Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Weihai provinces and districts (four in Yunnan, three in Suiyuan, one each in Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Weihai, and two each in the rest) and 19 generators (one in Weihai, and the rest with the same number as projectors). The total subsidy amounted to 15,992 yuan (over 3,000 yuan for Yunnan, over 2,000 yuan for Suiyuan, over 1,500 yuan each for Gansu, Guizhou, Chahar, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, over 900 yuan each for Gansu and Qinghai, and over 600 yuan for Weihai).</p>
<p>In addition, half-fee subsidies were provided to 20 provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao for the purchase of machinery and equipment, totaling 62 projectors and 61 generators (five each in Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces, varying numbers of three or four in other provinces, and one each in the cities). The total subsidy amounted to 28,178 yuan (Jiangsu received the most at 3,000 yuan, followed by Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guangdong at over 2,000 yuan, mostly over 1,000 yuan, and 450 yuan for each city). The total amount of full-fee and half-fee subsidies was 44,170 yuan and 94 cents.</p>

<h3>Notes on the Exhibition of Chinese Historical Books (3)</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>18. Yuan Dynasty Wang Meng's "Winter Green Thatched Cottage Picture" - Ink and color on paper, a three-foot vertical scroll. The red maple and winter green trees in the picture form an interesting contrast. Dry strokes are used and light ink is added for rendering, creating a natural and profound effect. An old man sits precariously in the thatched cottage, looking extremely leisurely. A waterfall can be seen among the trees. The mountain recluse inscribed: "My wild and awkward nature only loves quiet, climbing to a thatched cottage among the chaotic mountains. Winter green trees are planted in front of the door, and their branches are red with berries in the twelfth lunar month." The inscription also states: "Written by Wang Meng, the man of Yellow Crane Mountain, in the second month of the Xinmao year." There is also an inscription by Shen Xuan: "The hermit lives in the green shade, and the cherries are also red in the grain rain season. He drinks spring wine by the west window every day, and what is the need of praying to the chicken old man to keep him alive?" In addition, there are inscriptions and collection seals by Gao Huan.</p>
<p>19. Yuan Dynasty Wang Meng's "Secluded Residence in the Forest Foothills Picture" - Ink and color on paper, a six-foot hall painting of figures, landscapes, and several large pine and cypress trees. An old man sits in a spacious thatched hall, playing the qin. There are two bookboys with clear and refined features, devoid of worldly air. The mountain peaks are steep, with thick and lush strokes. Moreover, mountain recluses rarely include figures in their landscapes, making this painting especially elaborate and rare.</p>
<p>20. Yuan Dynasty Ni Zan's "Green Water Garden Picture" - Ink on paper, a three-foot vertical scroll depicting ancient trees, bamboo, and rocks, with elegant and unrestrained brushwork, loose and broad. Yunlin inscribed: "Beside the stone is a green branch, the ink is dripping after the rain on the goose pond. Who knows that the guest in the Green Water Garden recites poetry alone in the empty court at sunset?" "Written for the owner of Green Water Garden and inscribed, Zan, June 5th." Cao Shu inscribed: "I imagine the high-minded person has disappeared, and I only read the clear ink in the calligraphy. Where I used to walk and chant with a staff, the bamboo and trees are delicate beside the waves of ink." I once saw Yunlin's "Picture of Rongxue Zhai," which did not include the Zhai, but only a leather pavilion. Now I see this picture inscribed as "Green Water Garden Picture," but the picture is not a garden scene, which proves that both are undoubtedly genuine works of Yunlin. Zhu Sheng inscribed: "The stone pillar for weaving remains, the ink boat is far away, the phoenix perch is cold in the tin valley. I seem to wander in the clear secret pavilion, and I endure the white hair to write poetry on the wall." "Also inscribed, lighting incense and closing the thatched hall to play with ink, high sentiments are often forgotten by the world. Now that the relics are rarely obtained, I deeply treasure and should store them carefully."</p>
<p>21. Yuan Dynasty Fang Congyi's "Secluded Interest by the Stream Bridge Picture" - Ink on paper, a two-foot vertical scroll with broken clouds and mountain peaks, and smoke locking the treetops. The height of the artistic conception is unmatched by other artists. There are inscriptions by Wen Zhengming in the picture. Zhong Zheng inscribed: "New waves ripple the wind reeds, half of the clouds and mountains are visible after the rain. This is the most secluded place by the stream bridge, who calls Fang Congyi from the book?" A realistic record. Shi Tian inscribed: "Kuh Xian has already completed the path of ascension, chickens and dogs follow him to heaven. Playing with the remaining paper and ink, he will live for a thousand years in the world." My teacher, Mr. Xiao Wuquan, loves Fang Congyi's landscapes the most. Recently, he gave me a small landscape with secluded and unrestrained brushwork, which coincides with this painting by Fang Congyi and is even more precious.</p>
<p>22. Yuan Dynasty Bu Dan's "Heavenly Victory Landscape Picture" - Blue and green on silk, a two-foot hall painting with clouds embracing peaks and mountains surrounding stream banks. It is indeed a scenic spot by the lake and sky. Tianxi inscribed: "Painted by Tianxi of Quancheng in the ninth month of the Yichou year of the Yuan Dynasty." And wrote in the postscript: "Going north out of the Wujia Valley, the dense trees are heavily layered, and the people live densely. Looking back at the valley, the secluded residence with water and stones is a different scenic spot by the lake and sky." Tianxi followed Mi Gao, and this painting's clouds, peaks, smoke, and trees deeply penetrate the essence of both schools. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Problem of Balancing Prices</h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>(1) How Should This Problem Be Viewed?</p>
<p>Although everyone feels that prices are terribly high now, everyone thinks this is a normal phenomenon during wartime. This is indeed the case, and it is the same both domestically and abroad. Everyone grits their teeth and endures this war-time phenomenon, which reflects the entire nation's spirit of enduring hardship and sacrifice; it is worthy of pride to the world.</p>
<p>However, we must not simply accept it as inevitable and let it go. Because there are many people who are taking advantage of this reason to manipulate prices and deliberately raise them. For the overall interests of the country and the nation, everyone should firmly maintain the spirit of sacrificing everything, but in fact, we cannot deny that there is a limit to enduring hardships in material life. At the same time, it should be considered that if the people's livelihood is oppressed by high prices to the point of being unsustainable, it will not help the war effort.</p>
<p>Moreover, instead of saying, "It is currently necessary to find a practical solution," it is better to say, "For the sake of future security, it is now necessary to plan ahead and nip problems in the bud!" Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is known to be related to the war. Then, in the future, when there is no hope of ending the war, and when all the reasons that stimulate rising prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited escalation; there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>(2) Analysis of the Reasons for Rising Prices</p>
<p>Why does the existence of war sufficiently stimulate soaring prices? The reason is very simple. Let's take the current situation as an example:</p>
<p>(1) Before the war, the national expenditure was at most around 800 or 900 million yuan; even the total budget for the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), which set a record high, was only slightly more than 1 billion yuan. But since the outbreak of the war, due to the rapid increase in military expenditure, it is said to have exceeded 2.5 billion yuan. This means that the demand for goods has almost doubled compared to normal times. With increased demand, prices will naturally also increase. In Shanghai, the sudden increase in population has also greatly increased demand, but this is not a major factor, because:</p>
<p>(2) If production can increase at the same rate as the increase in demand, then the rise in prices can still proceed along a curve, without rising higher and higher. However, our production industries were already so backward in peacetime, and during the war, they have been damaged beyond recognition. Not only are industrial facilities dilapidated, but a large number of farmers have also stopped farming in the war zones. In addition, the Japanese army's looting everywhere has further increased the consumption of materials and widened the gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>(3) With the sharp decline in domestic production, coupled with the Japanese side's looting, our country's export capacity has been greatly reduced. Reduced exports affect the balance of international payments. Moreover, our country's military supplies and even civilian supplies are mostly dependent on overseas sources. As a result, the value of the currency itself is threatened. Moreover, the Japanese side is doing its best to disrupt our country's foreign exchange. Since the emergence of the foreign exchange black market, the value of the currency has fallen by about 40 percent. With the fall in the value of the currency, the prices of imported goods are bound to rise even more sharply. Therefore, the monetary burden for the government and the people to purchase foreign goods is even greater. The amount of currency circulating domestically will naturally have to be increased.</p>
<p>(4) When the amount of currency in circulation increases, if the flow of goods is smooth, then the degree to which currency stimulates prices can be reduced by the increase in the transaction rate. However, the transportation lines in the war zones are all controlled by the Japanese side, and even if freight transport relies on foreign merchants, it cannot cope adequately. Therefore, the situation of imbalance between supply and demand is even more serious, and the force of price increases is even stronger.</p>
<p>(5) In the process of commodity circulation, in addition to the difficulty of freight transport, there are many other obstacles. The Japanese puppets extort goods along the way in the war zones, and now they are further promoting their so-called "trade control." In addition, increases in freight rates, insurance rates, and domestic exchange rates are all intensifying the degree of imbalance between supply and demand and the momentum of rising prices.</p>
<p>These many pressures that stimulate prices are all products of the war. As long as the war exists, the possibility of rising prices will also exist. The pain of these high prices caused by the war can certainly be offset by the gains of the final victory. However, in addition to these natural reasons, there are also phenomena such as speculation, manipulation, monopoly, and hoarding: and these phenomena have a more fierce impact on prices. It is indeed impossible to calculate the position occupied by speculative prices in the prices of various goods. But can you just give an example to prove what level it occupies in the current price level?</p>
<p>(3) Speculative Prices in the Price Level</p>
<p>For example, from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the number of rice stored in warehouses in Shanghai did not actually decrease. In terms of the rice market season, this is the weakest period for rice prices throughout the year, but this time, contrary to the usual practice, prices suddenly began to rise sharply. The reason for the soaring prices: it is said that it was because the Japanese army was buying up rice, so Shanghai was in danger of a rice shortage. Everyone competed to hoard rice. It is understandable to hoard rice to prevent shortages. But what is suspicious is why did the rice price stop rising at the limit of 14 yuan? If there is really a danger of a rice shortage, even under strong control, a black market will occur, just like the black market that occurred during the rice shortage last spring. Moreover, when the rice price rose to 14 yuan, why did the Japanese army stop buying? If it is said that buying at a high price would be a loss, the Japanese army does not pay the market price for anything it buys. Is it expensive? Is it not expensive? It is not related to whether they buy it or not. Later, it was heard that this rice price surge could be seen as the "unfair cry" of Shanghai rice merchants. Because now, except for the price of rice, which is still the same as before the war, everything else has risen sharply.</p>
<p>Now, one of the factors in high prices is the foreign exchange relationship. The price of rice is not affected by this, because it is a local product. But cotton is also a local product, so why can't it be as stable as the price of rice? If it is said because of the need, then the need for cotton is not necessarily greater than the need for rice? If it is said because of the Japanese puppet regime's control and harsh taxation, rice has also never been treated differently? However, the current market price of cotton has risen by more than 50% compared to the average price in the six months before the war. The rise in cotton prices, in addition to factual reasons such as supply and demand, is largely due to the soaring yarn prices. Looking at January to October of last year, yarn prices were constantly rising, while cotton prices fluctuated. Therefore, the average yarn price for the whole year last year rose by 32.3% compared to January to August of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), while the cotton price fell by 2.1%. In January of this year, the yarn price rose by 52.9% compared to the average of the eight months before the war, and the cotton price also rose to 44%. (See the Sixth Shanghai Table in the January issue of the Economic Statistics Monthly)</p>
<p>Why did yarn prices rise so sharply? Of course, it is related to many of the reasons mentioned above, but speculative factors are even more related. Although from the decline in production, many figures on the destruction of production facilities can be presented to prove it, Shanghai is, after all, the producing area of cotton yarn, and the supply is always easier than in other places. There is no reason in circulation to cause yarn prices to rise sharply. Moreover, it is a domestic product, and there is no currency impact. Shanghai yarn prices have always dominated national yarn prices. If its price is indeed reasonable, then it should not take advantage of the needs of the interior to arbitrarily set high prices for sale. But now, because the price of yarn in the interior is surprisingly high, the price of yarn in Shanghai is also raised as much as possible, so it has become more and more expensive today. It should be known that taking advantage of needs to set high prices for sale is precisely one of the tricks of speculative manipulation.</p>
<p>We may as well compare it from the perspective of regions. The rise in prices in Shanghai is actually more severe than in the interior. Due to material limitations, let's compare July of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) and August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938):</p>
<p>Comparison of Price Indices between Shanghai and the Interior (Using the Average Price for the Whole Year of 1937 as the Base Period)</p>
<p>| Location  | July, 26th Year of ROC (1937) | August, 27th Year of ROC (1938) | Increase Rate |</p>
<p>| --------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |</p>
<p>| Shanghai  | 97.4                       | 127.6                       | 30.2        |</p>
<p>| (Guangzhou) | 96.3                       | 122.2                       | 25.9        |</p>
<p>| (Chongqing) | 104.2                      | 113.1                      | 8.9         |</p>
<p>(Note) Shanghai and Guangzhou originally used 1926 as the base period. The calculation was changed to use the average price for the whole year of 1937 as the base period, so as to compare it with the Chongqing index, which used July of 1937 as the base period, as above. For materials, refer to the China and Foreign Economic Yearbook published by the China National Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>Shanghai had already experienced war in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), while Guangdong and Sichuan were in the rear at that time. Taking the average price for the whole year as the base, and comparing it with the prices afterwards, Shanghai should theoretically have a lower increase rate than the interior, but the opposite is true. Like the price in Shanghai in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), which had changed from the front line to the rear, it rose more sharply than in the interior. The reason that the high prices in the interior influenced the prices in Shanghai is obviously untenable, and it instead proves that the degree of speculation in Shanghai is far more serious than in other places.</p>
<p>(4) High Prices and Wartime Economy</p>
<p>Generally speaking, prices and the purchasing power of the people are mutually causal. When prices rise, the income of the people increases, and therefore the purchasing power of the people also increases accordingly. If prices rise above the level of the people's purchasing power, the people's consumption will naturally shrink; therefore, prices will inevitably fall until they are equal to the people's purchasing power. But this is conditional on developed production and stable order, and in fact, it cannot be fully realized. Because wages will never rise in the same proportion as prices, high prices only weaken the purchasing power of the people, and there is very little possibility of increasing the purchasing power of the people. Look at the table below: The average wage of factory workers in Shanghai only increased by 1.8% in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) compared to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), but the cost of living for workers at this time has increased by 29.4%. This is an obvious fact:</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Cost of Living and Wage Index for Shanghai Workers</p>
<p>| Year            | 26th Year of ROC (1937) | 27th Year of ROC (1938) |</p>
<p>| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |</p>
<p>| Cost of Living Index for Workers (1) | 124.11                 | 160.60                 |</p>
<p>| Wage Index for Factory Workers (2)     | 100.00                 | 101.80                 |</p>
<p>| Purchasing Power of Currency (3)      | 80.57                  | 62.27                  |</p>
<p>(Note) (1) According to the figures compiled by the China Branch of the International Labour Office; (2) The wage index is calculated based on the "Monthly Average Wage Table of Shanghai Factory Workers" published in the January issue of the "Economic Statistics Monthly" published by the Economic Statistics Research Institute.</p>
<p>Moreover, our country's production is extremely backward, and now it is in a period of war that is destroying all production facilities. Therefore, the high rise in prices, on the one hand, reflects the fall in the external value of the currency, and on the other hand, it strengthens the exploitation of foreign goods on our national wealth. In other words, it is enough to promote the collapse of our country's finance, currency system, and the entire national economy.</p>
<p>On the surface: the income of comprador capital (merchants who specialize in promoting foreign goods) and quasi-comprador capital (such as producers who use foreign goods as raw materials, and sellers of their products, etc.) may also have increased to some extent: thereby creating an appearance of prosperity in bank deposit accounts. But it cannot compensate for the loss of the monetary value of other wealth capital, and it cannot compensate for the loss of the entire national wealth. That is obvious.</p>
<p>From the facts: The high rise in domestic prices has now made the entire people's lives feel a severe threat. If this threat is not eliminated, or even expands, the result will be the danger of shaking the entire social order. What is even more dangerous is that it will directly shake the economic foundation of the war. Recently, the United Kingdom loaned money to China to jointly balance foreign exchange. If we do not talk about the political significance, but analyze its economic significance, then everyone knows that it is "to maintain its commodity market for exports to China." In other words: only because China's prices have already exceeded the general purchasing power level, their commodity market in China, in addition to the violent obstruction of the Japanese side, has also erected a major obstacle. Balancing China's exchange rate is to prevent the continued rise in China's import prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason why we attach importance to this issue is not so much because of the current necessity, but rather because of the future, we must first plan ahead to "nip problems in the bud." Because the main reason for the current soaring prices is due to the impact of the war; then, in the future, when there is no hope of ending the war, that is, when all the reasons that stimulate rising prices continue to exist, there will inevitably be a risk of unlimited escalation.</p>
<p>(5) The National Government's Countermeasures to Balance Prices</p>
<p>The National Government has long had the determination to control prices during wartime; only because this kind of control has not yet escaped the experimental stage in European and American countries with extremely close-knit economic organizations. Although Germany's "appropriate price system" has been praised by the world, it is impossible to imitate in China, where the economic organization is like a pile of loose sand. However, in fact, it is no longer possible to allow it to go on like this for a long time. Moreover, if the speculative elements in prices can be eliminated, it can balance a lot. As long as all industries can put their consciences at ease, it can be easily solved. Therefore, recently, the provincial and municipal governments were finally ordered to organize price balancing committees, and work together with provincial banks and local banks to implement the balancing of prices of daily necessities for the people, and stipulated three types of fair price standards:</p>
<p>(1) For items whose production and transportation costs have not been affected by the war or have been slightly affected, the average price of the three or one years before the war shall prevail.</p>
<p>(2) For items whose production and transportation costs have been affected by the war, their costs after the war plus a considerable profit shall be the standard.</p>
<p>(3) For items whose costs are not easy to calculate, the total amount of capital required for their operation plus a considerable profit shall be the standard, and it is stipulated that the items for balancing prices shall be limited to daily necessities.</p>
<p>The organization of the Price Balancing Committee is jointly organized by the local government, the provincial bank or local bank, and the chambers of commerce and trade associations. For factories, merchants, or private individuals who hoard a large number of daily necessities, the committee may request the local competent authority to force them to sell them at the assessed price. It is also stipulated that those who violate the following items with the intention of speculative manipulation may be reported to the court in accordance with the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce:</p>
<p>(1) The quantity of mutual sales among the same industry shall not exceed the current quantity of inventory.</p>
<p>(2) Those in the same industry who do not operate daily necessities shall not mutually buy or sell futures on the market.</p>
<p>(3) The buying and selling of daily necessities shall not establish exchange markets.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai, which still occupies an important position in the national economy and is also the place with the most speculation and the fastest rise in prices, has unfortunately been surrounded in the occupied area, and political power can no longer play an active role. If it is not for the people to come forward and govern themselves, there is simply no way to proceed. Therefore, whether the citizens of Shanghai can be freed from improper exploitation and severe oppression on prices depends only on whether the leaders of various industries can come forward to support and strive for this.</p>

<h3>Germany's Price Stabilization Policy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Baorong</p>
<p>This article was written by the German economist Mr. Wagner. It is translated from the Japanese International Economic Weekly, No. 991. The original title is "Price Formation and Its Stabilization Policy"—Translator</p>
<p>A Monetary System Based on Labor</p>
<p>The central issue of price policy is none other than the issue of price stability. It is about how to prevent changes in the price market when drastic changes occur within the economy. There are often various reasons for thinking that such a situation is irresistible. Even the so-called "quantity boom" is based on a "price boom." In the past, capital and its income always occupied the center of economic life. But today, the key to analyzing all economic phenomena lies in labor and its payments. Therefore, although Germany's monetary system was initially established on the basis of gold, it has now been changed to take labor as its foundation. Initially, we believed that the best way to guarantee the future material life of the people was to accumulate currency. Now, we have lost confidence in this guarantee of currency, and what has replaced it is our right to labor, and we must give it permanent labor rights. And not only the right to engage in labor, but also the guarantee of income at any time. We have lost confidence in it; what has replaced it is our right to labor, and we must give it permanent labor rights. And not only the right to engage in labor, but also the guarantee of income at any time.</p>
<p>Germany's New Price Policy</p>
<p>Since the economic theory of the German National Socialist government has fundamentally adopted this new attitude, the impact of price fluctuations and the various reasons for their occurrence can be explained by economic fluctuations. Therefore, the new price policy of the National Socialist government is not only satisfied with eliminating the current obstacles. In the past, the most outstanding price commissioners only needed to solve their practical problems with agile methods; but now, in addition to practical problems, it is also necessary to solve their fundamental principles. That is, how to make price changes fully adapt to today's economic life? The high price policy, which strives to raise prices and seek to overcome panic, may not be able to stimulate the general economy and induce a boom; but the soaring of prices has various major dangers that cannot but be deeply warned against. In the transition period, although high prices may not be without the role of revitalizing the economy, they are also creating deadly toxins at the same time. Therefore, the German National Socialism conditions' adoption of the policy of preventing price increases, and this kind of attempt, is essentially completely different from the policies generally implemented. In a word, it is to seek to establish an appropriate price.</p>
<p>Establishing an Appropriate Price</p>
<p>When an economic tendency toward high prices is found in all aspects, then on the one hand, it has affected the external economic relations and caused a bad effect; on the other hand, the raw material economy has changed due to the increase in burdens. Moreover, this tendency still cannot fully overcome the panic that dominates various economic sectors. In this situation: On the one hand, the National Socialist government sets the "highest price" so as to fully and rationally complete the vigorous plan in the price policy, in order to maintain the possibility of construction. On the other hand, it will conduct individual and fundamental reviews of various economic parts. It is necessary to make the prices of each part correspond to the characteristics of that part; that is, to individually apply various special controls.</p>
<p>In examining price policy, one cannot only focus on monetary prices. If this point of view is used, it will not be consistent with its purpose. Usually, when prices fall, one always hopes for their recovery. But the height of prices is not the main issue. The really main thing is whether the mutual relationship between prices is balanced? Whether it is mutually adapted to the national economic life and other factors? In other words, whether the price level maintains an appropriate relationship is the focus of the problem.</p>
<p>The so-called "appropriate relationship" is generally determined by the national economy. Therefore, the concept of price must be criticized from the standpoint of the entire national economy, that is, on the one hand, it must be criticized from the perspective of operation, and on the other hand, it must be criticized by the market price.</p>
<p>Today's prices in Germany are adapted to production on the one hand, and adapted to labor income on the other. The only thing that the German head of state is most concerned about for the German economy today is how to raise the necessary labor force.</p>
<p>The Task of Germany's Price Policy</p>
<p>In recent years, although Germany's price policy has implemented its function of stabilizing economic life, it is still not enough to consider this as having fulfilled its task. Because in a certain period, we should try to reduce the impact of foreign price increases (that is, reduce the impact of the rise in world prices); in a certain period, we should try to help develop sales markets and establish appropriate and effective prices. After the technological development of new raw materials, we should then determine how to sell them to the market at what price? Even in solving all the needs of social policy, as well as solving technical problems in supply, new tasks can generally occur in price policy.</p>
<h3>Finance: The Credit of Legal Tender Is as Strong as Vajra; "Counterfeit Money" Cannot Destroy It; Value Is Higher Than "Counterfeit Money"</h3>
<p>Since the puppet "Provisional Government" in North China stipulated the prohibition of the use of legal tender from March 11, and at the same time forced the people to exchange legal tender for puppet banknotes, and implemented severe penalties, in the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the legal tender of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications continued to circulate as usual without any obstacles. Moreover, foreign banks still regard legal tender as the only currency of our country. Although deposits of "United Reserve Notes" (banknotes of the United Reserve Bank of North China) are also accepted, Chinese and foreign banks all write the words "United Reserve Notes" on the deposit slips and account books to show the difference. Regarding the exchange rate between legal tender and "United Reserve Notes", although the puppet "Provisional Government" has regulations to forcibly lower the number, the price of legal tender in Tianjin is always higher than that of "United Reserve Notes". As for the transaction of exchanging legal tender for "United Reserve Notes", it is handled by general small money shops. There is a dark market price every day. The lowest price of "United Reserve Notes" was once 90% (that is, 1,000 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 1,100 yuan of "United Reserve Notes"), and the highest was once 8 yuan (that is, 1,000 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 1,008 yuan of "United Reserve Notes"). The price was between 1,024 yuan for two or three months. Recently, the market price has mostly been around 1,0890 yuan. The market prices from April 11 to 15 are listed below:</p>
<p>Market Price of 100 Yuan of Legal Tender Converted into "United Reserve Notes"</p>
<p>| Date   | Market Price |</p>
<p>| ------ | ----------- |</p>
<p>| April 11 | 108 yuan 5 jiao    |</p>
<p>| April 12 | 108 yuan 13 fen |</p>
<p>| April 13 | 108 yuan 25 fen |</p>
<p>| April 14 | 109 yuan 13 fen |</p>
<p>| April 15 | 109 yuan 4 jiao    |</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>Due to the weekly holiday, there were only one or two members present at the cash dark market situation, but there were no supply and demand positions, so the price was not called out. There were also no transactions at the money exchange retail stores. It is heard that the selling price is still 2,075 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in jewelry stores has not changed. The Da Tong Hang is still 211 yuan, the Xin Tong Hang is 209 yuan, and the purchase price is 203 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 15th: British pure gold is still unchanged, still calculated at 7 pounds 8 shillings 6 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Silver Slightly Rises, Large Bars Flat</h3>

<h3>The Inside Story of Woolen Cloth Trading</h3>
<p>— Fu Shi Sheng</p>
<p>(Continued from April 10th)</p>
<p>(5) Invoicing</p>
<p>Except for brokers reselling, the customer naturally understands that a slightly larger amount is invoiced to deduct commissions. Those who purchase directly from firms or factories will naturally receive accurate invoices. However, it is also common to add a certain amount, which is intended as a standard practice to avoid market disruptions. Domestic factories often invoice in this way because they frequently have hidden discounts that are deducted when settling accounts. Additionally, parties with frequent transactions and close relationships often issue an invoice with a "照" (zhào, meaning "as is") character (presumably representing the previous market price). This all refers to buying and selling among industry peers. Invoicing to retail customers is another matter altogether. Since customs duties are often involved in transporting goods to customers, in addition to using carbon paper to avoid errors on the original invoice, a false invoice is often issued according to the customer's instructions.</p>
<p>(6) Price Guarantee</p>
<p>Whether for whole cases, split bolts, or cut pieces, the practice of price guarantees exists among industry peers. A price guarantee (meaning guaranteeing the purchase price won't be unprofitable) can be verbally agreed upon or noted on the invoice. The standard price guarantee period is generally limited to five days (at most ten days). If, within the time limit, the same quality, pattern, and brand of goods become available at a lower price, the difference must be compensated. Price guarantee transactions are the most reliable, so the words "price guarantee" are usually avoided unless absolutely necessary. Price guarantees are more common for futures contracts, followed by common-grade Chinese clothing woolens. Price guarantees for Western-style suit woolens are quite rare. (End)</p>
<h3>Coal　Dalian Coal Also Arriving　Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>Although the market has sufficient reserves of Wenzhou charcoal, shipping from the Ou River has been disrupted. If it is blockaded, the charcoal supply will be affected. Therefore, traders are preparing for shortages. In reality, the weather is warming, sales are declining, and demand is very low. Recently, a certain ship arrived with grass-wrapped coal from Dalian, totaling five to six hundred bags, each weighing over forty catties. It is being sold for around three yuan per dan (unit of weight), with brokers actively peddling it. It is said that this is a trial run, and if there is a market, larger shipments will be sent.</p>
<h3>Metals　Black Iron Billets　Spot Shortage</h3>
<p>Transactions in black iron billets are booming due to frantic purchases by businesses from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and also by local factories producing thermos bottles, printing materials, and toys. As a result, there is a shortage of spot goods, and the standard price is skyrocketing, rising to 31.50 yuan per 200 pounds. It is reported that a certain metal shop on North Suzhou Road received over 50 tons of spot goods yesterday and is offering them at 31.60 yuan. Over ten tons have already been sold, but demand remains high. It is said that the shop, to maintain good relations, is only selling small quantities and is unwilling to sell in bulk.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports　Large Shipments of Fir Lumber Arriving in Shanghai　Many Goods Also Arriving from Xingang</h3>
<p>Large quantities of fir lumber are being shipped in. Another three ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 126,850 pieces of fir lumber from Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Yesterday's imports included 40 cases of fresh eggs from Xingang, as well as 26 cases of golden needle mushrooms and 32 bags of stone powder, also from Xingang.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 30 cases of egg yolk and white were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods　French and Western Linings Flood the Market</h3>
<p>Since the war, Japanese linings have stopped being imported, and the cost of Western goods has soared due to exchange rate issues. Yesterday, at the A-277 Public Tea House, they were selling for 9.5 jiao (cents), causing buyers to use summer cloth linings and domestic goods as substitutes. With the fall of Jiujiang, summer cloth is also in short supply. Domestic French and Western linings are experiencing a significant surge in sales. Furthermore, after being designated as military supplies by the government, the procurement of raw materials became difficult, resulting in 70-80% of the products being woven with coarse wax and thin thread. Small factories are springing up, leading to a flood of French and Western linings in the market. Factories are competing with each other to offer low prices. Dealers and Western clothing stores are seeking to push prices down. Prices are gradually declining. Yesterday, Hong Sheng, an old brand, was still selling at 7.75 jiao per yard. Hua Xing, Yong Cheng, Xin Hua, Li Xing, and other brands were selling for only 5.5 jiao per yard. Brokers reselling can still deduct a commission of 2-3 jiao per bolt. It is said that their own cost is only around 4.6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market　Imported Sugar Continues to Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of imported sugar rose sharply. The association set the price. No. 24 Dutch coarse white was traded at 25.90 yuan for 50 bags of spot goods. Re-exported goods were quoted at 17.80 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B Mark Western warehouse goods were 25.85 yuan, and Eastern warehouse goods were 25.75 yuan, an increase of 0.20 to 0.30 yuan compared to the previous day. Domestic sugar was offered at 24.30-24.40 yuan for Three-Tip White and 24.10-24.00 yuan for Top-Grade Ice, with only a few scattered transactions totaling over 200 bags. Shipments of Shimen sliced brown sugar continued to arrive, but prices have not yet been set.</p>
<h3>Price Increase Statistics for Various Industries in Shanghai Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Shanghai's environment over the past year has been awaiting the arrival of final victory. Due to the expansion of the war, prices have been soaring. This can be seen in the retail price index. In fact, this has been unfolding in a way that has made people living in Shanghai feel threatened and unable to maintain their livelihoods, and their hearts are filled with anxiety and frustration.</p>
<p>Originally, wartime prices are inevitably more expensive than usual due to transportation disruptions and supply-demand imbalances. The hoarding and profiteering of unscrupulous merchants are also important factors contributing to high prices. Therefore, the soaring prices in Shanghai over the past year are a natural result. However, many prices have become distorted, mainly due to speculative manipulation and the excessive taxation by special interests. At the same time, due to government control of foreign exchange, ordinary commodities have been restricted. Manufacturers wanting to purchase foreign goods have had to buy high-priced foreign exchange on the black market, which has increased costs. Therefore, the high prices in Shanghai have been compounded by these three distorted factors.</p>
<p>Now, let's statistically analyze the price increases published in newspapers by various industries over the past year. There have been a total of 168 cases. Excluding 18 cases of repeated price increases, the net total is 150 cases, representing 150 separate industries and business/factory units that have raised prices. These 150 cases include 16 commodity categories: electricity, fuel, clothing, medicine, food and beverage, hygiene, decoration, transportation, culture, metal, daily necessities, construction, leather, raw materials, consumables, and public utilities.</p>
<p>Comparing the number of price increases by month, August had the most with 41 cases, followed by September with 27, July with 23, June with 21, October with 17, November with 13, December with 9, April with 7, May with 5, January with 3, February with 2, and March with none (including repeated price increases). It must be mentioned that the higher number of price increases in June, July, August, and September was due to the sharp contraction of the foreign exchange black market at that time, which led merchants to use it as an excuse to raise prices. Therefore, the number of cases was higher than in other months. Further analyzing the types of commodities with price increases, daily necessities ranked first with 41 cases, food and beverages ranked second with 34 cases, clothing ranked third with 22 cases, medicine ranked fourth with 12 cases, and electricity, fuel, and cultural items each ranked fifth with 7 cases. Leather ranked sixth with 5 cases, decorative items and transportation ranked seventh with 4 cases, consumables, raw materials, construction, and public utilities each ranked eighth with 3 cases, and hygiene ranked last with 2 cases.</p>
<p>The types of goods with price increases and the percentage increases are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Seasoning powder: increased by 10% to 35%.</p>
<p>(2) Shaoxing wine: Jingzhuang brand increased by 0.256 yuan per catty, Xiaohuadiao increased by 0.28 yuan per catty, Taidiao increased by 0.32 yuan, and so on.</p>
<p>(3) Noodles: cut noodles increased by 300 cash per catty, yellow noodles increased by 320 cash per catty, skins the same, vermicelli increased by 200 cash per catty, and so on. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Good News of Counter-Offensives from All Fronts</p>
<h3>Shanghai Organizations　Send Telegram to Chairman Chiang　People in the Isolated Island Support Resistance, Pledge Unwavering Determination to Exert Utmost Efforts to Win Final Victory</h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese army on the fronts of Central Hubei, Northern Jiangxi, Northern Hunan, Eastern Henan, Southern China, and Southern Shanxi has begun counter-offensives, making smooth progress with tremendous momentum, posing a serious threat to the Japanese army. London newspapers have even published these messages in large characters, wishing China final victory. As a result, the morale of all sectors is extremely boosted. Various organizations in this city believe that although this full-scale counter-offensive is not the final overall counter-offensive to achieve final victory, it has achieved the goal of containing Japanese forces, shattering the dream of seeking peace through conspiracy, and fully demonstrating China's strong resistance capabilities, giving the international community a better impression. The bravery and dedication of all the soldiers have particularly inspired the people of the country. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission to express condolences and appreciation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing, and to all soldiers and officers on all fronts: Since the July 7th Incident, 21 months have passed. Although the enemy has mobilized troops from the entire country and wielded sharp weapons to launch fierce attacks against us, fortunately, thanks to your wise decision-making and skillful command, all soldiers and officers have fought with common hatred against the enemy, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army. Recently, you have again launched counter-offensives on all fronts, making smooth progress with tremendous momentum, posing an even more serious threat to the enemy. The news of victory has been deeply inspiring. We respectfully send this telegram to express our condolences and appreciation, hoping that you will continue to work hard, annihilate the ugly enemy, and restore our homeland. Although the people of the isolated island are in a difficult situation, they support the resistance and are unwavering in their determination. We pledge to exert our utmost efforts to win the final victory and complete the great task of national reconstruction. We respectfully offer our sincere feelings and humbly request your consideration and acceptance. Signed, Various Organizations of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops　May Be Transferred Elsewhere</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that according to eyewitnesses, Japanese troops who had entered the Shanghai area from Nanjing and various parts of Central China were moving towards Wusong yesterday morning (the 15th). Large-scale troop movements were seen along the Wusong Road area in the morning and afternoon. Yesterday morning, news came from the Hongqiao area that several large units of troops from the interior were passing along Hongqiao Road, heading towards Zhabei. This was the second day of large-scale Japanese troop movements along the road. According to reliable sources, the troops entering the Shanghai area this time arrived by train from Nanjing to Suzhou and then walked to Shanghai, accompanied by artillery units and supply vehicles. It is not yet clear where they are moving to. A Japanese military spokesman also acknowledged the possibility of troop movements but said that he had no specific information about it. According to the views of observers in this city, since these troops are now moving along the Wusong Road area, they may be transported elsewhere by ship later. However, the observers did not speculate on their next destination.</p>
<h3>Passengers Stranded from the Libao Wheel　Special Ship Returns</h3>
<p>Approved by the Ningbo Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>Negotiated by the Dinghai Association</p>
<p>The Dinghai Association is very concerned about the fellow villagers stranded from the Libao Wheel. In addition to finding ways to receive them, they also plan to hire a foreign ship to return to Dinghai to avoid displacement. Previously, the association telegraphed the Ningbo Defense Headquarters for instructions, which was reported in detail in various newspapers. Now it is learned that the association has received a reply approving the hiring of a ship to directly release them to Dinghai, but only once. Those who wish to go to Dinghai can contact the association directly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs　Permits Summer Cloth to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Advising the Ministry to Instruct Customs to Release</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated the prohibition of the transportation of 54 kinds of goods, since summer cloth is a hemp product and belongs to one of the 54 kinds, the Zhejiang and Ou customs immediately prohibited loading and export. Later, after the Shanghai and Wanzai chambers of commerce repeatedly telegraphed to request the lifting of the ban, stating that the Jiangxi summer cloth transportation was solely for the purpose of providing clothing materials to the people of the country, it is now heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the request after receiving the telegram, and has advised the Ministry of Finance to instruct customs to release it.</p>
<h3>Two Thousand Japanese Troops Rush to Aid　Fierce Fighting in Ben Niu　Two Japanese Planes Bomb Tianmashan　Japanese Troops in Liuhe Have Broken Through and Collapsed</h3>
<p>Before twelve o'clock yesterday morning, a large number of fully armed Japanese army soldiers departed from the Jiangwan and Wusong areas, traveling in fifty to sixty large trucks, each carrying more than thirty soldiers, passing through Zhabei Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, Republic New Road, Jiaotong Road and headed west to increase aid. It is heard that there has been fierce fighting in the Ben Niu section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway.</p>
<p>Japanese planes bomb Tianmashan　The Japanese troops who "swept" Tianmashan in Songjiang were almost completely annihilated by the guerrillas. The Japanese army was still unwilling to give up. Yesterday (the 15th), it mobilized two bombers and flew to bomb it wildly. The guerrillas had received prior intelligence and were all hiding in the trenches, so there was no damage. The Japanese army exhausted dozens of bombs.</p>
<p>Japanese troops in Liuhe collapsed　The Japanese troops in Liuhe, after being besieged by guerrillas day and night, were exhausted and suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday evening (the 15th), they broke through and collapsed. The guerrillas immediately tracked them down and killed Captain Isogai and more than ten soldiers. The guerrillas also suffered slight damage. The town was recovered by the guerrillas that night.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Detained Ships Yield No Results　Portuguese Ships All Suspended</h3>
<p>Portuguese Consul Has Requested the Ambassador to Japan to Negotiate　Deyao Pledged to Italian Merchants, Japan Allows Navigation　American Merchants and Huamei Ships Unload Goods Today</p>
<p>The Japanese warship's detention of Portuguese ships has not been answered after protests. Various shipping companies have decided to suspend all navigation and request the ambassador to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. American merchants and Huamei ships unload goods today. Deyao, because it is mortgaged to Italian merchants, Japan has agreed to sail as usual. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>No Reply After Protest　Since the ten Portuguese merchant ships, Mida, Tang Qiao, Tang Bei, Tang Lu, Hailong, Rude, Baode, Fulu, and Dade Libao, were detained, they are now anchored in various pontoons in Yangshupu. Japanese warships have dispatched Japanese troops to station on each ship to monitor them. Although the passengers have been released, the cargo and crew are still on board. The Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai protested to Japanese Consul General Miura. As of the night before last, the Portuguese Consul General had not received a reply from the Japanese Consul General, and the cargo on the ships was still not allowed to be unloaded first, resulting in significant losses for the ships.</p>
<p>Portuguese Merchants Decided to Suspend All Navigation　The Portuguese ship companies, in view of the Japanese warships' unreasonable detention of ships, forcibly taking down the Portuguese flag and raising the Japanese flag, although the Consul General protested to Japan, the Japanese warships continued to detain the ships, which was very indignant. They have requested the Portuguese Ambassador to China to telegraph the Japanese Ambassador to Japan to negotiate with the Japanese government. Before the detained ship incident is resolved, all Portuguese ships in China will be temporarily suspended. Today, the Portuguese ship Avé Maria, represented by the Xie Xing Firm, which sails to Changyinsha, was originally intended to sail from Changyinsha to Shanghai, but has now suspended sailing and is temporarily anchored at Changyinsha.</p>
<p>Deyao Follows Usual Route Due to Mortgage　The Deyao Wheel of the Portuguese merchant Liuzhou Company, which sails on the North Sha line, arrived in Shanghai from Haimen, Jiangsu, at 2:30 p.m. yesterday and docked at Wharf No. 13 on the Bund of Beijing Road. It is scheduled to sail as usual at 9:30 a.m. today. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Italian Yi Hua Foreign Company that the ship has been mortgaged to the Italian Yi Hua, and the Italian Consul General to Shanghai has notified the Japanese authorities, so the ship can sail as usual, which is different from the situation of other Portuguese ships. The Japanese Navy has allowed the ship to sail on its original route.</p>
<p>American Merchants' Agents Unload Goods　Since the Portuguese ships Tang Qiao, Tang Bei, and Tang Lu, represented by the American Huamei Company, were detained, the cargo on each ship has not been unloaded. Therefore, the company reported to the American Consul General to Shanghai and negotiated with the Japanese side to unload the goods, because although the ships belong to Portuguese merchants, the cargo loaded is carried by American Huamei. Today, Fang has approved the request and allowed the cargo to be unloaded first. According to a senior Chinese employee of the company yesterday, the company has decided to send tugboats to unload the goods tomorrow, Monday. As for the cargo of the Mida and other ships, the Japanese side still does not allow it to be unloaded first.</p>

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from banking circles that although the first phase of the public bonds has been scheduled for issuance on June 1st, the unified tax and tobacco and alcohol tax revenue has been designated as a fund for the repayment of principal and interest, which will be kept in custody by the Shanghai National Debt Fund Management Committee, and the Central Bank and its entrusted banks will be the payment agencies. However, the National Debt Committee and the Central Bank have not yet received orders from the Ministry of Finance. It is now decided to comply after receiving the order. It is heard that the public bonds are unregistered, and raised according to the face value. Because the public bonds are for replenishing the expenses of the War of Resistance, and the guarantee is very reliable, the people of the whole country have expressed their willingness to subscribe and give economic assistance to the government, so as to achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization: Announcement to Compatriots, Advancing Theory and Practice Simultaneously, Eradicating Traitors and Their Accomplices, Telegram to All Provinces and Cities Nationwide for Joint Effort</h3>
<p>From today until the 23rd of this month, all provinces and cities across the country will uniformly hold National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors in this city has specifically formulated propaganda methods and schedules, and notified all sectors to implement them consistently. Today is the General Propaganda Day. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of this city has specially issued an announcement to compatriots and telegraphed the whole country, stating the Three Meanings. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Propaganda Methods: (1) From April 17th to 23rd of this year is the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. (2) The propaganda schedule for this propaganda week is as follows: (1) April 17th is the General Propaganda Day; (2) April 18th is the Citizenry Propaganda Day; (3) April 19th is the Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Propaganda Day; (4) April 20th is the Education Sector Propaganda Day; (5) April 21st is the Cultural Sector Propaganda Day; (6) April 22nd is the Professional Sector Propaganda Day; (7) April 23rd is the Women's Sector Propaganda Day. (3) During this Propaganda Week, all sectors should strive to implement the following points: (1) Encourage the people within each sector to unanimously participate in the branch organizations of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of their respective sectors; (2) All citizens should hold public oaths of the National Covenant separately; (3) The National Spiritual Mobilization Associations and their branch organizations of each sector should hold the first National Day meeting; (4) Each sector should send representatives to give lectures within the organizations of their respective sectors on the content of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, and study and promote it together. Major and minor schools, as well as supplementary schools, etc., should conduct large-unit education on National Spiritual Mobilization; (5) Village chiefs of each village, factory directors of each factory, managers of each store, principals of each school, and heads of each family, etc., should urge their subordinates to consistently implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline; (4) All sectors should reprint as much as possible the single editions of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures, and widely circulate them; (5) All newspapers should publish special issues; (6) The propaganda slogans for this Propaganda Week are as follows: (1) Nation First, Ethnicity First; (2) Military Affairs First, Victory First; (3) Concentration of Will, Concentration of Strength.</p>
<p>Announcement to Compatriots: The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors of Shanghai announces to all compatriots in the city as follows: Dear compatriots of the whole city, on this day when the full line begins the general counter-offensive, we hold the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, and we truly feel infinite excitement, and its profound and great significance cannot be exhausted in a single word. On this day when the propaganda week begins, this association respectfully offers three meanings to encourage each other with all compatriots in the city:</p>
<p>First, the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline is profound, broad, and all-encompassing, not only applicable to the current period of the Anti-Japanese War and national construction, but also to be regarded as the only guideline for establishing the country for thousands of years to come. Therefore, all citizens of our city must recite and deeply understand this outline, taking nation first, ethnicity first, military affairs first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength as the absolute common goal, being conscientious and never perfunctory, uniting the hearts of 450 million compatriots into one heart, and gathering the strength of 450 million compatriots into one strength. Then, not only is the destruction of the current violent enemy foreseeable, but we can also become a strong guarantee of world peace and a firm cornerstone of world justice. Therefore, the village chiefs of each village, the factory directors of each factory, the managers of each store, the principals of each school, and the heads of each family, etc., must lead their subordinates to study carefully, fathers advise sons and brothers encourage each other, teachers instruct and friends guide each other, and take the instructions of this outline as the highest criterion. Every word and every sentence must strictly abide by the scope indicated by the outline, preventing all far-fetched and distorted interpretations. Even if there are other meanings that can be pointed out, they should only be uniformly interpreted by the highest leader who personally formulated this outline, so as to avoid the danger of divergent opinions and confusion. If we can sincerely believe and earnestly implement it, we will be worthy of being the descendants of our Yellow Emperor and the sons and daughters of China.</p>
<p>Second, the points indicated in the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline are all important items for practical action. Therefore, we must not only strive for knowledge but also strive for action. The life of drunken stupor and death must be corrected, and the vigorous spirit of striving must be cultivated. The habit of perfunctory survival must be eliminated, and the attempt of selfishness and self-interest must be broken. The divergent and complicated thoughts must be corrected. All these items should be practiced one by one in our daily life, without any pretense. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, a small number of people, as if lost, have inevitably become corrupted in thought and behavior without realizing it. The root of Shanghai's abnormal prosperity lies in this. There are also many instances where thoughts and opinions have formed a unity in principle, but there are still many divergences in the details. If this complication continues for a long time, it will inevitably lead to the dispersion of the people's will and harm the war effort. Therefore, from now on, our thoughts and actions must not be allowed to flow into corruption, nor must we allow our people to flow into deterioration. We must be of one heart and one mind, be loyal and trustworthy, abandon small differences and seek great unity, and work hard for the Anti-Japanese War and national construction.</p>
<p>Third, the enemy, due to the failure of military aggression, has turned to developing political conspiracies, using the scum of our minority nationalities in an attempt to shake our overall situation of the Anti-Japanese War. Wang Jingwei received the special knowledge of the late Premier and should have done his best to serve the country. Unexpectedly, since 1927, he has been fickle and exhausted all the ugly态of turning clouds into rain. Our central government has been generous, hoping that he would reflect deeply. Unexpectedly, this time he colluded with the enemy country and openly sought surrender. This kind of national traitor who has lost his humanity is abandoned by the people of the country. Now, Wang Jingwei not only does not know how to repent, but also secretly sends his henchmen to Shanghai to stir up trouble. All compatriots in our city should unanimously give the most severe condemnation to this national disgrace, eradicate his stirrings, and extinguish his conspiracy, so that there is no room for the existence of national traitors on Chinese soil. Combining the three meanings is the three most urgent tasks for all compatriots in our city at present. We earnestly hope that we will work together to achieve success. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Whole Country: To the National Spiritual Mobilization Associations of all provinces and cities, for the public perusal of all compatriots in all provinces and cities: Today, Shanghai is holding the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. The association now respectfully presents three meanings with the most sincere enthusiasm on behalf of the four million citizens of the city, and encourages each other with the compatriots of the whole country: The meaning of the outline is profound, broad, and all-encompassing, not only the highest principle during the current period of the Anti-Japanese War and national construction, but also the only guideline for establishing the country for thousands of years to come. All our compatriots across the country should have a copy in hand, study it morning and evening, and strive to thoroughly study its contents and thoroughly understand its essence, so that our words and deeds have a criterion, and our will and strength can be concentrated. The outline points out that all are important items for our daily practice. The thoughts of confusion and divergence, and the habits of perfunctory survival, should be completely eradicated first. Do not be corrupt, do not deteriorate, with the vigorous spirit of striving and the steadfast spirit of excellence, then the destruction of the enemy country can be expected soon, and the great cause of national construction can also be completed quickly. Wang Jingwei colluded with the enemy country and openly begged for surrender. His personality is so despicable that even ten thousand deaths are not enough to cover his guilt. Recently, he also sent his henchmen to Shanghai to stir up trouble. All our compatriots across the country have unanimously condemned him, vowing to completely eradicate him. I still hope that all compatriots across the country will severely punish the remnants of Wang Jingwei, so that there is no room for the existence of national traitors on Chinese soil. Urgent words, I hope we will work together. The General Headquarters of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of all sectors of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Methods for Handling War Losses: Explanation of "Deferred Assets," Continuing Business Enterprises with Excessive Losses to be Included in Assets and Amortized Annually for Compensation</h3>
<p>It is reported that the "Methods for Handling War Losses" drafted by Xi Yushu, Chief Accountant of the Shanghai Public Trust Accounting Firm, has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which believes that the war losses proposed in the original presentation can be approved as deferred assets to be offset by annual surplus amortization. All sectors in this city are paying close attention because it concerns the final accounts of enterprises. However, the name "deferred assets" in the approval is a specialized term and is not easy to understand. The original text previously published by Accountant Xi is also something that all sectors deeply want to know the details of. The reporter has interviewed Mr. Xi to solicit his comments and obtained his speech as follows: The so-called deferred assets, in accounting terms, refer to the expenses or losses of a continuing business enterprise that cannot be borne at one time, and must first be included in the assets and amortized annually, such as start-up expenses and the disposal costs of machines when they are no longer applicable, and business rights, etc., are all amortized annually in accounting. War losses are an unprecedented catastrophe, and can also be handled in this way, so that all industries can recuperate and gradually recover. My suggestion for the war-time commercial accounting treatment method is based on the fact that since the military uprising, various businesses in the war zones and near the war zones have suffered extremely heavy losses. If the settlement is handled in the usual way, there will be many obstacles. Therefore, I have submitted four items of methods to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that war losses be treated as deferred assets and gradually compensated, so that the remaining businesses can gradually enter a safe path and will not shake the foundation of the national economy.</p>
<h3>Last Night's Bad Weather: Communications Interrupted for a Long Time, Almost Isolating Shanghai from Other Regions, Recovering Only After Several Hours</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 15th), the Pacific commercial communications between Guam and San Francisco were interrupted, and rare weather conditions almost isolated Shanghai from the rest of the world. The communications were interrupted around noon, and the wireless companies handling commercial telegrams between Shanghai and various world centers were unable to work from 11:00 AM. After several hours, work resumed last night, but the cables between Guam and San Francisco were still unable to be used. It was not known for sure yesterday when they could be repaired. At the same time, the telegram companies are now handling telegram traffic through the Pacific coast and transferring to the United States. Telegrams sent from Shanghai first go to Manila, and then wireless from Manila to San Francisco. According to the Xujiahui Observatory last night, the hindrance affecting wireless communications yesterday was not caused by storms or air currents. According to experts, this type of hindrance is far above the center point of the storm and is not uncommon, but usually only lasts for a short period of time, rarely more than two or three hours. Within the area affected, wireless communications cannot pass. This hindrance forms a dead spot, and sound cannot pass through this point. Furthermore, according to shipping personnel, there has been dense fog in the area between Shanghai and Hong Kong in the past few days, and the coastal areas of North China have also been affected.</p>
<p>Dance Hall Group of the Refugee Relief Society: Donation Results Announced</p>
<p>The Donation Committee of the Dance Hall Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its second standing committee meeting yesterday. A total of 16 standing committee members, including Yuan Ludeng, Gao Xinbao, Xie Baosheng, Yu Kefei, and Sun Jile, attended. They discussed the progress of the association's affairs at length and passed a resolution to hold a charity tea dance competition. However, in order to seek universal consent, the plan will be immediately sent to various dance halls to solicit opinions, with a deadline of five days for a reply, so that work can begin. In addition, the results of this donation by the group have been announced, raising more than 14,000 yuan. The best performers in Class A are Daxin, Lido, and Xianle, while those in Class B are Xuan Gong, Far East, and International. It is heard that the association is drafting commendation measures to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings from Past Dynasties: Works to be Changed and Displayed Tomorrow, Only Half of the Total Shown in the First Display</h3>
<p>The exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties, collected by more than 50 famous collectors in Shanghai, has gathered more than 300 famous works from past dynasties. Due to the limitation of space, they could not be fully displayed. It is heard that starting from this week, all of them will be replaced. After the replacement, those displayed for the first time will not be seen again. Those who love art and want to see the full picture of the exhibits of the association should not miss this last opportunity.</p>
<h3>Tang Wenzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, etc.: Public Memorial for Shen Meisou, Held at Jing'an Temple Tomorrow on His 90th Birthday</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Zipei was a famous scholar of classics, history, and literature in modern times, also known as Meisou. His calligraphy was exceptionally good, and those who obtained his calligraphy treasures cherished them like jewels. Meisou served as a provincial treasurer and presided over educational administration many times in the late Qing Dynasty. He also served as the supervisor of Nanyang University (now Shanghai Jiaotong University). Famous figures such as Tang Wenzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Shi Jiushao, and Jing Qiankun were all his disciples. Tomorrow (the 18th) is Meisou's 90th birthday. Tang Wenzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, and others have specially invited his students, friends, and former colleagues to hold a memorial ceremony at Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road at 12:00 noon tomorrow to commemorate him.</p>
<h3>U.S. Fleet Commander on Way to Hankou: Short Stop in Nanjing and Jiujiang, Expected to Arrive in Hankou on the 21st, Returning to Shanghai Around the 26th</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, departed from Shanghai yesterday morning (the 15th) on his fast ship, the Isabel, to Hankou. The U.S. ship Guam also went along. It is heard that it will replace the U.S. ship Oahu and be stationed in Hankou. According to the current plan, the Isabel will stop in Nanjing, Jiujiang, or other ports on this trip and is expected to arrive in Hankou on April 21st and return to Shanghai on April 26th. The Oahu will sail down with the Isabel at the same time. In addition, the French gunboat D'Iberville also left Shanghai yesterday morning for Hong Kong. It is reported that when the newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Cosme, came to Shanghai on the General Joffre, the ship collided with the Guangzhou in Hong Kong and had to transfer to the gunboat D'Iberville to Shanghai. Furthermore, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy claimed yesterday when receiving reporters from various newspapers that the U.S. ship Isabel and Guam are now preceded by a Japanese ship. According to the Japanese authorities, the ships are expected to arrive in Nanjing on Tuesday, Jiujiang on Wednesday, and anchor downstream of Hankou on the evening of April 20, and arrive in Hankou the next morning. Admiral Yarnell may land in Anqing and Jiujiang for a visit.</p>
<h3>The Great Cause of Father Yacquinot (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Erqian</p>
<p>I remember a certain reporter once said: "The two wars of Hongge'ertu and Bailingmiao are only the prelude to our national liberation war." He also said: "The center of Hongcun (referring to Hongge'ertu) is the Catholic Church." The so-called "center" here has two meanings: in terms of the location of the whole village, the Catholic Church is in the center of the village, and the social, economic, cultural, and even political and military center of this village is also in the Catholic Church. The development of Catholicism in the border provinces has achieved amazing results. Taking Sui East as an example, the real force that dominates society is not the government but the church. The parish of the church is more effective than the political area of the county government. The development of the church is not mainly to persuade people with religious ideas: but to stand in front of the generally helpless poor people with the power of the church and the clergy, and handle the necessary work of life such as production, education, self-defense, medicine, elderly care, and childcare for them.</p>
<p>Indeed, Catholicism has made considerable contributions to this war. On the battlefields of the north, south, east, and west, the priests and parishioners of the Catholic Church have all made enthusiastic sacrifices and amazing stories that can truly move the heavens and weep the gods. Some have become martyrs on the battlefield, and some have worked in the rear. Not to mention the distant ones, just take Shanghai as an example, the famous Father Yacquinot is enough to attract people's attention. Last July, he returned from fundraising in the Americas and passed through Japan, where his short stay at the Fujita family resulted in the mystery of his disappearance, which caused much concern among people. Various newspapers carried this news, and for a time, almost all the attention on the isolated island was focused on Yacquinot. The reason why he can win people's sympathy and hold the public's attention and breath is because he is a priest, a humanitarian, and he practices his spirit of "love others as yourself." Everyone calls him the father of refugees, the friend of China, and foreigners call the Nanshi refugee area he founded "Yacquinot Zone", using his last name to print a stamp on his tragically managed career for future generations to remember.</p>
<p>On the French Concession in Shanghai, some roads are called Father Jin, Father Lao, and Father Du roads. Although Father Yacquinot's three characters cannot be said to be household names, they are well-known. In people's minds, they are as familiar as those road names. The priest is French and has two names. His real name is Yacquinot de Besange, and his Chinese name is Rao Jiaju, which is completely Chinese, just like the names of Ma Xiangbo and Mei Lanfang, which are reasonable and not jarring at all. This is the style of modern Catholic priests. When they come to China, they first ask a well-informed person to give them a name, then wear long robes, pick up chopsticks to eat, read Chinese books, speak Chinese, and run to the countryside to mingle with the people to preach. Father Yacquinot has also undergone this kind of training and life; and he is an outstanding one. In his French last name, because there is a small "de" character, it has caused many speculations that he is either a duke or a count, in short, he comes from a famous family and is a noble descendant. I think there is no need to say this, Father Yacquinot is detached from the world, and he does humanitarian work in the spirit of religion, which is precisely the nobility of his personality, just like the thoughts of Plato surpassing (The Divine Ploto), which makes people eternally admire and respect. The perfection of thought and personality is the crystallization of personal effort, and it seems that it has nothing to do with the great-great-grandfather, so there is no need to bother to investigate his family tree.</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus (The Societ.v of Jesus) is the most powerful and international organization in the Catholic Church. Its members are all over the world, and most of them are talented and skilled. At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, members had already come to China, such as Francis Xavier, Matteo Ricci, Ferdinand Verbiest, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, and Giuseppe Castiglione. Not only were they loyal to their work and strived to preach, but also introduced specialized academics such as geography, astronomy, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics to China. The eastward spread of Western learning is its origin. The members of the Society of Jesus cannot be said to have made no contribution. Now, the cultural and charitable undertakings in Shanghai, such as the library and observatory in Xujiahui, the orphanage, Xuhui College, Aurora University in Lujiawan, and the observatory on Sheshan Mountain, were all initiated by the members of the Society of Jesus, and they continue to benefit the people today.</p>
<p>The Rao Jiaju we are talking about is also one of the members of the Society of Jesus. Before coming to China, he stayed in England for a long time and studied literature. Then, in 1913, he came to China to preach and taught English at Xuhui College and Aurora University. Students were afraid to attend his class, but no one disliked him because he treated people with sincerity and became a close friend of young people. He used to live in the second dormitory of Aurora University, and later moved to the Catholic Church on Luban Road, spending almost 20 years between teaching and preaching, speaking until his tongue was dry and his lips were parched, tirelessly teaching people. When the January 28th (1932) Shanghai War came, refugees in Hongkou were in urgent need of rescue, and a person who was impartial, universally respected, and valued by both sides (China and Japan) without causing international problems was needed to take on this difficult task, and of course, it was none other than Father Yacquinot.</p>
<p>Father Yacquinot is a social worker full of enthusiasm and active. He once said to the students of Aurora University: "People who do social work should be more active, more sociable, study psychology more, and know more friends, because society is a group of people, and people who serve in it must thoroughly understand it, otherwise they will not succeed, and there is no hope of completing the cause." He is also proficient in English, French, Chinese, Greek, Latin and other languages, and is a great orator. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia and Kidney Deficiency: Sexual Impulses Should Be Suppressed</h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Faculty of Medicine of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>According to daily experience, it is known that among the various organs and impulses of the human body, those that are absolutely controlled by the nerves and mind are probably none more than the sexual system. Ordinary functions and impulses, such as hunger, thirst, sleep, digestion, and breathing, are only partially controlled by the mind. When encountering fright, anxiety, sadness, etc., although the function of a certain organ can be temporarily suspended, it cannot be controlled for a long time, let alone permanently blocked. However, the sexual impulse is not like this. With spirit and mind, it can not only be subdued for several months or years, but also be made to lie dormant indefinitely. For example, when a person's full mind and spirit are concentrated on thinking or physical work, or the ability or attention is focused on his interesting industry, the idea of ​​absurdity and debauchery cannot enter his heart, and the evil and romantic sights and sounds cannot disturb his mind. Only when a person's mind is lazy and his physical strength is useless, the idea of ​​delusion will enter and dominate, and that person is in danger. Try to analyze the environment and the inducement of falling into crime of one hundred young people who are looking for flowers and willows and are addicted to brothels, and you can get ninety-nine people who are victims of the environment and temptation. It is definitely not after careful consideration that they are deliberately evil and lewd. The most common inducements, such as eating plenty of rich food and irritating food, can heat the blood and dim the wisdom, and indulging in wine and alcohol can make the lustful people crazy. Uncontrolled drinking gradually weakens people's intelligence, restraint, and decisiveness. Vulgar jokes and obscene stories are more than enough to spoil people's perceptions. Sensual dances, obscene films, and coercion from bad friends, etc., are all enough to make lustful people like a small boat off the anchor, drifting in the storm, and finally people can only helplessly go to the countryside.</p>
<p>If a person is overly indulgent in lust, he can often weaken his energy. For example, people who masturbate excessively or those who indulge in lust without restraint not only suffer from mental decline, but also spinal nerves and sexual function must have hundreds of diseases. Therefore, they often suffer from back pain, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. Once these diseases have been contracted, when treating them, one should clear the heart and reduce desires, and all languages and texts that are enough to cause sexual impulses must be kept away. Then, actively take the German animal testicular essence preparation for men, "Body-Con," which can show very effective results. "Body-Con" is made by extracting the testicular essence of calves, stags, orangutans, goats, and sea dogs, and has the three major effects of nourishing the brain, kidneys, and blood. I have used this agent to treat premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia and other diseases for seven years, and have never encountered a failed case. Therefore, the agent has been praised by countless Chinese and foreign doctors and is happy to introduce it to patients. Its female "Body-Con" functions to regulate menstruation and seed production.</p>
<h3>The Seriousness of Coughs</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaigiang</p>
<p>Coughs are most easily overlooked. The reason is that cough sufferers do not seem to exhibit any immediately dangerous symptoms, so the condition is allowed to drag on, and the cough becomes increasingly severe, ultimately becoming incurable.</p>
<p>From a true pathological perspective, a cough is the lungs' way of expelling harmful external agents, and it is a form of resistance against intrusion. Using anesthetics would only reduce resistance. Based on my experience of over twenty years, and with reference to reports from medical experts in various countries, the most effective medicine for lung ailments is "Pulmonal," invented by German Dr. Tume. No matter how stubborn or difficult to cure, or how close the cough is to becoming consumption, taking "Pulmonal" can relieve coughing and dissolve phlegm within three hours. It is superior to cod liver oil in its ability to nourish the lungs and prevent consumption, as proven by medical experts in various countries.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission from Masturbation and Incomplete Development</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>After masturbation becomes a habit, the frequency of nocturnal emissions gradually increases, causing continuous loss of essence and blood, which leads to neurasthenia, brain weakness, memory loss, and lower back pain. It can even hinder development, leading to incomplete development. Therefore, young men who suffer from nocturnal emissions caused by masturbation should seek active treatment. To cure nocturnal emissions, the bad habit of masturbation must be stopped. Taking "Nair-Es Spermatorrhea Pills" can cure it completely. If neurasthenia and other symptoms of weakness, incomplete development, premature ejaculation, or impotence have already resulted from spermatorrhea, taking "Butiren" will invariably bring about a cure. Below is a case to prove this.</p>
<p>Patient Yan Zhengkang, from Kunming, is 22 years old and a student. (Self-reported) My body is weak, my development is incomplete, my brain is weak, my memory is poor, and my studies are declining. (Source of the illness) I was poisoned by obscene books, leading to excessive masturbation and indulgence, resulting in symptoms of weakness such as incomplete development. (Treatment process) I was given "Nair-Es Spermatorrhea Pills" to treat the spermatorrhea, and then "Butiren" to nourish my essence and brain. After taking several bottles, the spermatorrhea stopped early, and I immediately felt that my essence was sufficient and my brain was refreshed. My energy was restored, my complexion became rosy, and my weight increased. It was like being reborn.</p>

<h3>### Seeking Pleasure: A Dangerous Game</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is often contracted from casual moments of pleasure, which are usually found in places where people seek fleeting enjoyment, such as brothels. Therefore, the price of such pleasure is not only money but also suffering. This is truly the most expensive game. Everyone knows it's a dangerous game, yet they still flock to it. This is why gonorrhea is becoming increasingly rampant, and effective treatment is necessary.</p>
<p>Regarding the methods of treating gonorrhea, opinions vary. However, after careful consideration, many are difficult for us clinicians to believe. Based on my many years of experience, the only medicine that deserves praise for treating gonorrhea is "Klinon," invented by German Dr. Peter, which is recognized worldwide. I have used it for acute and chronic gonorrhea, as well as various secondary and concurrent symptoms, and it has always been effective. Therefore, "Klinon" has become the first guarantee of a radical cure for gonorrhea patients. This has not only been proven by me personally but also by people internationally. I hereby excerpt the experimental report of Dr. McGary, Director of the Cornell Venereal Disease Hospital in the United States, as follows:</p>
<p>Patient John Gay, 30 years old, is the son of a wealthy merchant. He has suffered from gonorrhea for six or seven years, and the concurrent symptoms he has suffered from include prostatitis, arthritis, and orchitis. He has endured various types of suffering and has tried every new medicine that comes out each year, but the gonorrhea has only penetrated deeper. He then entered the Cornell Venereal Disease Hospital that I established for treatment. After I used complete diagnostic methods to detect his condition, I learned that the gonorrhea had spread throughout his bloodstream. It was difficult to achieve success with partial chemical therapy and membrane-penetrating sterilization therapy. Therefore, I used "Klinon" as an oral medication, and externally, I used "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" according to the instructions and diagrams, instructing him to treat himself at home. As a result, within two weeks, his symptoms were greatly reduced. His joints were able to move freely again, and the swelling of his prostate and testicles had subsided. He continued treatment for five weeks and was completely cured, and has not relapsed since.</p>

<h3>### Discussing the Recurrence of Chronic Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Doctor Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Corner of 9 Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Once gonorrheal urethritis becomes chronic, people often ignore their own symptoms because the pain is gone, so they don't pay attention and act recklessly (such as engaging in sexual activity, drinking alcohol, or overworking). As a result, not only do the symptoms of urethritis worsen, but the gonorrhea also takes the opportunity to further invade and cause secondary urethritis and prostatitis.</p>
<p>Even more common is that patients who have had chronic urethritis take some powerful medicine or temporarily adhere to health regimens, causing the gonorrhea to become dormant and subside. They then mistakenly believe that their old illness has been cured and no longer fear the consequences, indulging in promiscuous sexual activity. The latent gonorrhea is stimulated by this and reawakens, and then runs rampant. In severe cases, it flares up immediately; in delayed cases, it will inevitably appear within a day or two. Some even forget that they have had this old illness and become angry at the other party, thinking that the other party is unclean and has transmitted the disease to them. Isn't this unfair? I have encountered this many times and will relate one example here. A year ago, a man named Xing Wangyun came to me for treatment. Xing was the son of a wealthy family and often frequented brothels, resulting in him contracting gonorrhea. Because he greedily took powerful medicine and reluctantly temporarily refrained from lewd pursuits, the gonorrhea on the surface temporarily ceased activity and seemed to have been cured. Not long after, he married a woman, and within three days, the gonorrhea recurred. He suspected his wife of infidelity and was quite resentful, not knowing that his wife was actually harmed by him. He invited several doctors to examine her, but they could not determine the cause. After my diagnosis, it was confirmed to be a recurrence of the old illness. I prescribed the gonorrhea miracle drug "Klinon," along with German electrostatic therapy and surgery to correct the condition. His wife also took "Klinon" and used "Karol-Schädlich Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories externally. As a result, the gonorrhea of both Xing and his wife was completely cured within four weeks. They have lived together ever since and have not relapsed, and their marital love is as harmonious as ever. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Twenty appointment numbers issued daily, each number costs only five cents.</p>

<h3>The Yang Zaisan Assassination Attempt: Trial Continues This Morning</h3>
<p>Rumor has it that Yang's son and father, seeking favor with a certain party, willingly became traitors and sold out Xiong Jiandong.</p>
<p>Yang Zaisan, an elderly man from Changshu, nearly sixty years old, was temporarily residing at the Dahu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. On the 5th of this month, at noon, he went out with a friend and had lunch at the nearby Juxing Restaurant. As he and his friend were walking back to the Dahu Hotel, he was suddenly assassinated by a burly man from Siyang named Xu Zichou. The</p>
<p>bullet jammed in the chamber and did not fire, so Yang was not harmed. Subsequently, detectives and police officers arrived after hearing the alert and pursued and captured Xu Zimao, who had fired the gun. He was taken back to the police station, sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation, and remanded in custody for further investigation and questioning. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, according to people from Changshu who are familiar with the matter, Yang has considerable potential influence in the western countryside of Changshu. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance War, Yang was unable to live peacefully in his hometown due to its fall to the enemy and the rise of bandits. He fled to Shanghai with his family.</p>
<p>Yang's son, Yang Xingfang, is over thirty years old. After the fall of his hometown, he gathered local patriotic youths to organize a guerrilla force. Many young men and strong laborers from the surrounding countryside came in response. Yang Xingfang appointed himself commander-in-chief and was under the command of Xiong Jiandong, commander of the guerrilla forces of six counties: Changshu, Kunshan, Jiading, Qingpu, Taicang, and Baoshan. He engaged in many attacks and skirmishes with the enemy. This spring, Yang Xingfang suddenly had a falling out with Xiong Jiandong due to some matter and immediately defected and surrendered to the enemy,</p>
<p>willingly becoming a traitor. The enemy appointed Yang Xingfang as the "剿匪 Commander" of Changshu, ordering his father, Yang Zaisan, to be in Shanghai to liaise with the enemy, luring Xiong Jiandong to Shanghai to be detained by the enemy. There was once a rumor that Xiong had been killed, causing a great uproar among Xiong's subordinates, leading to the shooting of Yang Zaisan in Shanghai. As for the previous report that Xiong Guisong, a man from Hubei who served as the third detachment commander under Yang Xingfang, was lost at the age of eight and raised by Yang Zaisan, who treated him like his own son, arranged his marriage, and had children with him.</p>
<p>He was entrusted with important responsibilities by Xingfang, hoping that Xiong would repay his kindness, but ultimately he repaid kindness with hatred. Those who came to inquire said they did not know the details and did not know who this Xiong was. The French police department, based on the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the concession, summoned the plaintiff for detailed investigation. The Second Special Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on this case at 10:00 AM today to determine whether it is an ordinary feud or involves political relations. The truth will be revealed at that time to clear up people's doubts.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Arrest Chinese Constable in Route Tenant de Bienville</h3>
<p>Constable suspected of colluding with terrorists; Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of investigation.</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 15th), the Japanese-language Continental New Report stated that Major Hayashi, the chief of the political section of the Japanese military police, issued a warning to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department of the Public Concession that its armed and uniformed police personnel were entering the area of the Kunlian Border Road without any legal reason on Thursday. This was due to the arrest of Chinese constable No. 3088, surnamed Li, by the Japanese military police in an alley next to Route Tenant de Bienville on Wednesday morning around 9:00 AM. After detaining the Chinese constable, the Japanese military police also arrested seventeen Chinese people, suspected of being terrorists who attacked the Wujiaochang area of Route Tenant de Bienville on Wednesday morning. Before the arrest of the Chinese suspects, they engaged in fierce gunfire with the Japanese search team, with both sides firing over thirty shots. One of the arrested Chinese people was injured in the thigh. Six of them have admitted to being members of the Iron-Blooded Anti-Traitor Corps. The report also stated that when the Japanese military police were paying attention to the hiding place of the terrorists, they saw the Chinese constable Li lingering nearby and suspected that he was colluding with the terrorists, so they arrested him and押押to the Western District Japanese Military Police Headquarters for questioning. After questioning, it was clarified that he was not related to the terrorists. However, the Chinese constable admitted that he was waiting for a Chinese person to give him a monthly "protection fee" of five yuan for a secret opium den in the area. Subsequently, a Japanese police officer from the police department, accompanied by a European police officer, went to retrieve the Chinese constable. Mr. Newhook, the assistant commissioner of police of the police department, is currently responsible for investigating the incident involving the Chinese constable.</p>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily on the 16th, according to Japanese sources, the Political Department of the Japanese Military Police recently notified the Public Concession Police Station, instructing it to strictly order its subordinate police officers not to "intrude" into the Chinese area. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Report, a Chinese constable of the Public Concession, with the number 3088 and 37 years old, was detained by Japanese soldiers next to Route Tenant de Bienville for accidentally entering the Chinese area. As for the reason for his detention, on the morning of Wednesday (the 12th), when the Japanese army arrested the guerrillas there, they suddenly saw a Chinese constable nearby and suspected that he was an accomplice of the Chinese army, so they arrested him. After questioning, he was released after it was clarified that he was not involved.</p>
<h3>Abduction of a Girl: Sentencing Set for the 20th</h3>
<p>Li Aihua, the thirteen-year-old daughter of Li Zuoheng, a Cantonese shareholder of the Ouyayuan Cantonese midnight snack shop at 339 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, was studying at the Dongxin Primary School in Shiyuli. On January 5th of this year, she was abducted from the school and taken to the Songjiang countryside, where she was sold to the Hong family there. Later, because guerrillas attacked the Japanese army in the area, the Hong family fled, abandoning Aihua in the house and leaving her unattended. Subsequently, neighbors of the Hong family learned that the girl had been abducted and brought there. The neighbors took the girl to Shanghai by boat. When the boat arrived at the dock, they told the girl to go ashore and go home by herself. The girl got lost and was driven by hunger and cold to cry beside the iron gate at the entrance of the Dongnanli alley on Dagu Road in the French Concession. She was taken in by a police officer surnamed Li at his home. On the 23rd of last month, the police officer's wife, Li Zhou, took the girl to visit relatives at No. 1 Annakin Apartments on Avenue Annakin. The girl was playing with a child at the entrance of Annakin Apartments when she was spotted by a friend of her father who was passing by. He notified the girl's father and reported it to the French police station, who brought the girl to the station. After questioning, it was learned that she was first abducted to the home of a fellow villager, a woman surnamed Li Wu, at No. 29 Taihuali on North Jiangxi Road. After drinking a cup of boiled water, she became dazed and confused. She was then taken to Songjiang and sold to someone. She also recounted her return to Shanghai. Since Li Wu was suspected of being involved in the abduction, she was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The other day, Judge Liao held a continued hearing. The French Concession authorities prosecuted her for the crime of disrupting the family. The victim, Li Aihua, also appeared in court to give a detailed account of the abduction. When questioned, Li Wu denied knowing anything and claimed to have been framed. She also hired lawyer Deng Jiabing to defend her. The court ordered the announcement of the conclusion of the hearing and set sentencing for the 20th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Elder Brother Sues Younger Brother for Embezzlement: Younger Brother's Wife Faints Again</h3>
<p>The police officers gave emergency treatment and she gradually woke up. The elder brother did not pursue the matter and withdrew the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Fang Qixian, a shareholder and manager of the Mei Hua Printing Factory on North Zhejiang Road, 海門人, previously imprisoned his younger brother Qichang for disregarding his wife's wishes and independently advocating for borrowing a large sum of money to marry a nineteen-year-old woman named Zhang Cailing. Under the repeated slander of his wife, he dismissed his younger brother from his job as a traveling salesman at the factory, leaving Qichang with no way to make a living. He then falsely claimed that someone from the outside had learned that the silk in the factory</p>
<p>was Japanese goods and was going to inspect the factory and should be quickly moved and hidden. He then hired two Xiang Sheng taxis and drove to the factory, taking away sixty-seven bolts of silk worth 1,500 yuan, which he was selling. Qixian reported this to the Hui Si police station, who sent detectives to arrest Fang Qichang and Zhang Cailing, took out the stolen goods, and sent them to the First Special District Local Court for investigation. Zhang fainted in court that day, and Fang Qixian did not appear in court. The court ruled that Fang Qichang should be remanded in custody, Zhang should be released on bail, and the date should be changed for summoning Fang Qixian to appear in court for questioning. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The day before yesterday was the date for the</p>
<p>continued hearing of the case. The defendant, Fang Qichang, was brought to court under police escort. His wife, Zhang Cailing, surrendered herself to the court. The plaintiff, Fang Qixian, also rushed to the court in compliance with the summons. However, Zhang Cailing, after sitting in the eighth criminal court for only a moment, suddenly repeated her previous fainting spell during the first trial. The police officers in the court then administered artificial resuscitation, with some spraying warm water on the woman's face and others massaging her chest. Until Fang Qixian declared to the court that he did not want to pursue the matter and begged for</p>
<p>withdrawal of the lawsuit, and Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the police station, declared that the police station had no objection to Fang's accusation. Then, after Magistrate Fang Qinghuan ruled that the case would not be accepted, the woman's pale face gradually disappeared and she regained consciousness. She was then helped away by a middle-aged woman. The two transformations of the beauty all started at the beginning of the trial, not before or after. This is an unprecedented image.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan: Strict Security Measures</h3>
<p>Employs three look-alikes as decoys and prepares three identical cars to confuse the vision.</p>
<p>Due to the recent resurgence of patriotic assassins carrying out their work, the puppet "Mayor" of Shanghai, Chuan Xiaoan, has long been fearful of sharing the same fate as his predecessors. In addition to tightening security around the puppet government to prevent any eventuality, reporters learned from reliable sources yesterday that Chuan's latest security measures are even stricter. All personnel in the puppet government must be recommended by extremely reliable sources before being hired. Even the bodyguards and servants employed at Chuan's residence are not easily hired without a thorough investigation. Recently, Chuan has also found three look-alikes with the same face as Chuan and prepared three identical cars to accompany him when he travels, in order to confuse outsiders' vision. Every night, Chuan waits until after 1:00 AM, when everyone is asleep, before quietly returning home, which must be a miserable life for someone.</p>
<h3>Seeking Zhang Zhu Caiwen</h3>
<p>Suffering from mental illness</p>
<p>There is a woman from Pudong named Zhang Zhu (also known as Caiwen), who is in her thirties and has two sons. Her husband, Zhang Yunchun, works in the Shandong Post Office. Zhang's mother, Liu, had a mental illness. She had an attack in the past and drowned in a river. Her brother, Ruiqi, also died of a mental illness. Doctors believe that this is due to heredity. Eight or nine years ago, Ms. Zhang had an attack after giving birth to a child. Her husband sent her back to her hometown. She was admitted to the psychiatric department of the Puyu Hall in the Nanshi area for treatment but was not cured. Later, she was treated by Dr. Sun Lifu, but she did not fully recover. In mid-March of this year, that is, after the Lantern Festival, she suddenly went out and did not return. At first, her family did not pay much attention because she often went out. Recently, her family has been deeply alarmed by her long absence and has been searching everywhere, but she has not been found yet. Her family members believe that she once wandered into the guerrilla headquarters in Hangtou Town last year, speaking incoherently. Someone recognized her as the daughter of Zhu and knew that she had a mental illness, so they released her. The Pudong area is now unstable. It is not known whether she has come to Shanghai. A reward is currently being offered to find her in the hope of reuniting with her.</p>

<h3>Japanese Yamanoto of Taikang Yarn Factory Kidnapped by Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Met guerrillas near Nanxiang and were taken along with the car to the guerrilla area.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 14th), at around 11:00 AM, a Japanese man was captured by the Chinese guerrillas near Nanxiang. His life or death is still unknown. The Japanese side is sending out a garrison to search for him. The fact is that on the morning of that day, a Japanese man named Yamanoto (43 years old), the head of the catering department of the Taikang Yarn Factory, a Japanese company on Yangshupu Lanzhou Road in Hongkou, went to Jiading to purchase rice. He went there by car, driven by a Chinese man named Zhang Fengming. Unexpectedly, when Yamanoto was returning to Shanghai after buying rice, a small team of Chinese guerrillas, about sixteen or seventeen people, who were searching in the area, caught sight of the car and stopped it from moving forward, firing a warning shot. They detained the car and ordered Zhang to drive the car to the guerrilla area. Afterwards, the Japanese side learned of this and sent a team to search for him, but there has been no news of him yet.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Yesterday I read a news report about "Someone Sending a Warning Letter to Pig Merchants." The wording involving me is obviously not true. (1) I published advertisements in the Shen Xin newspapers on March 27th and 28th, "Changshun Pig Bank Statement on Trademark Shadowing," which can be consulted. (2) I, the manager of Changshun Pig Bank, have always been law-abiding and have joined the industry oath and joint declaration, declaring my position and unwavering commitment. (3) I and my bank have always operated in Nanshi and Wusong. After August 13th, we moved into the French Concession Industry Market. The statement that we have always operated in Hongkou is even more slanderous. Moreover, the report contains many errors in my name, which further proves that what I have heard is untrue. I dare to guarantee to the public with my personality that my will is firm and I will never participate in illegal organizations. I hereby declare this and request a correction. To the Editor of Your Newspaper, Gu Baoxiang, April 28th, 16th Year</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Annihilation Warfare</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>These past few days have been filled with news of recovered territories, truly inspiring and encouraging. There is an exceptional sense of optimism about the victory of the war of resistance. However, we already know that this is not a general counter-offensive, but rather another form of attrition warfare. The advent of a general counter-offensive will undoubtedly be much more massive in scale and its pace and scope of recovery will certainly far exceed the present. Now, I would say that this is a counter-offensive based on opportunity, aimed at further attrition, depleting the enemy's manpower. In other words, this is annihilation warfare.</p>
<p>Previously, we merely advanced step by step, defending section by section, with the aim of depleting the enemy's manpower and resources. Therefore, when the enemy attacked, we fought back; when the enemy did not attack, we remained stationary. This situation seemed as if we were being beaten without retaliating. While the goal of attrition was indeed achieved, the power of initiative remained in the enemy's hands. As a result, when they did not come, we had nothing to deplete, and what we did deplete of theirs was mostly limited to resources, while overlooking manpower. Resources are easily replenished, but manpower is irreplaceable. We only achieved a small part of our attrition goal.</p>
<p>Now, we are launching counter-offensives based on opportunity. "Based on opportunity" means targeting the enemy's weaknesses, attacking where it suits us. It is best if we can recover territory, but it does not matter if we cannot recover it or cannot hold it even after recovering it, because we have already achieved our goal of depleting the enemy anyway. However, in this attrition through counter-offensives based on opportunity, I hope that our military authorities will pay special attention to the depletion of enemy manpower. In other words, we must emphasize annihilation warfare.</p>
<p>Manpower is, after all, the root of combat power; even with just flesh and blood, a new Great Wall can be built. We have plenty of manpower, while the enemy's greatest shortage is manpower. We far surpass them in this aspect, with a ratio of seven to one. Their total troop strength is only six million, and over one and a half million have already come to China, with six or seven hundred thousand already lost. If we focus on continuously striking them in this area, I believe it will be the enemy's true fatal wound.</p>
<p>What I have been paying attention to in the newspapers is the number of enemy deaths in each battle; the gain or loss of a place is still uncertain. I believe that as long as we continue to fight and continue to annihilate them, I will remain fully optimistic, even if we occasionally lose territory, let alone occasionally recover it. And the current counter-offensives based on opportunity can better achieve this goal of annihilating the enemy because if they are afraid of us and do not come to their deaths, we can attack them and annihilate them one by one, unlike before when we could only watch them leisurely outside our fire line.</p>
<h3>Spring Plowing</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The spring breeze sweeps across the earth, easing the stiffness of the harsh winter; everything withered has revived. New buds sprout at the tips of branches, and tender green specks are embedded in the field paths. That warm, humid breath spreads throughout the countryside.</p>
<p>The plowing oxen, with their two sharp horns, move their heavy steps, plowing through the fields; the mud stirred up resembles the waves stirred up by small ships in rivers.</p>
<p>In April, there is no idle person in the countryside. The garrison troops issued an order to assist with plowing.</p>
<p>A squad of brothers walked out of the dilapidated temple, looked at the farmers and plowing oxen bathed in the spring sun, and a layer of joy pressed on their hearts. They released their gun handles and picked up plows and hoes; a smile floated on the squad leader's face as well.</p>
<p>The scene on the rice paddies immediately changed: gray cloth military uniforms, bamboo hats, waving slender ox whips, and supporting plow handles to assist with plowing; the original farmers were instead left with free time.</p>
<p>Surprise flew onto their faces. A young farmer waved his hand, clenched his fist, and said warmly and humbly:</p>
<p>"Please rest. We shouldn't receive help from brothers who are contributing to the country, but rather we should help you."</p>
<p>Then, he gave a bamboo pipe to the old soldier; but he didn't know how to smoke, so he turned around and urged the plowing ox forward again.</p>
<p>The soft, melting spring breeze swept across the field, constantly broadcasting: a fresh and slightly damp fragrance. The vitality of life melted into nature, and a group of brothers were thus further excited. However, the loyal farmers stubbornly refused to be idle, and after yielding once, then twice, they finally said more firmly:</p>
<p>"You helped build the roads we should have built; you helped dig the trenches we should have dug; and now you're helping plow the fields we should plow. Rest, please. We really don't want you to do it for us—although the military and the people should cooperate."</p>
<p>"Yes, we're really sorry! Protecting the country, protecting us, and still..."</p>
<p>As another farmer interjected, the old soldier also burst into laughter and said, "The powerful driving force should now be entrusted to the countryside. Please don't underestimate yourselves. You will be evolving from sturdy men's self-defense training to guerrilla warfare. Your work is our work; our work is also your work. Haha..."</p>
<p>The laughter stopped, and the plowing oxen were also tired as time passed. The mud on the rice paddies was also spread evenly. Looking over, it looked like black velvet carpets. So, leading the plowing oxen, they walked onto the grassland, and a group of people sat around on the ground, and their fatigue disappeared into joyful laughter.</p>
<p>The golden rays of the setting sun went from soft to dim, and the twilight gradually thickened. At this time, a group of people lined up in a long row and embarked on their way home. On the peaceful field road, led by the old soldier, they unleashed a heroic song:</p>
<p>"Protect your own hometown, work your own fields. The war of resistance is for freedom; the war of resistance is for survival. Unite, advance! The people are the army, the army is the people, wave your guns and hoes to fight the enemy, the military and the people are of one heart!"</p>
<h3>Peace at the Mouth of the Cannon</h3>
<h3>Smiles and Tears</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>...Like frost-dried fallen leaves, disappearing into the spirals of the wind, the smiles faded from everyone's face. Without smiles, the skin inevitably spasms, unwilling to smile and unable to smile.</p>
<p>A light smile, blown away by the storm; a faint smile, hidden by dark clouds; a thin smile, pierced by bullets. Although every smile contains a story, happy, interesting, everyone has many stories, and there are still many smiles, but these stories are finally stolen. Placed in dense velvet, cherished, careful, treasured, it is still inevitable to break through the barrier, seize the key, break into the box, and empty the bag. The empty brocade box, looking around blankly, the happy, interesting stories, leave no memory behind. Without the surplus of laughter, sour and salty ice pillars drip down.</p>
<p>Cowardly people say: "Our smiles are gone forever. The happy, interesting stories have been stolen clean. What joy can we have?"</p>
<p>They are often a group of gray people, deeply sad, their faces covered in tears. Smiles are lost and stories are forgotten, and they are immersed in tears all day long. Every tear often has a story. Everyone has many stories, sad, painful stories that cannot be forgotten, so tears fall. Replacing the stories of the past, the smiles of the past, tears fall into the brocade box.</p>
<p>It's not a nightmare. Although the brocade box hasn't changed, try groping it with your hand: you will find that your hands have been soaked by tears. So many stories gnawing at the heart are like poisonous snakes. These are not happy, interesting stories. The memories of sorrow and pain have been shed into thin cicada shells. Surrounded by cicada shells, people shed tears. Ask the cicada shells for laughter again, and they don't know and have no way to know.</p>
<p>Losing the smiles of the past, everyone's face is draped with a "melancholy". When the plunder of the invaders has not been recovered, they are unwilling to smile and unable to smile. Cowardly people are accustomed to sorrow, immersed in the deep pool of tears all day long, corroded, weak, tired, and timid. "Aren't you going to retrieve the laughter of the past?" When tears strip the cowardly of their weakness, I can't help but call out loudly.</p>
<p>Pain grinds us, everyone has many unfortunate stories, stories that make people shed tears. It's not the claws of the invaders, what shameless idiot would be willing to force a smile?</p>
<p>The cowardly tell me: "Laughter is gone, you can only wash your face with tears from now on."</p>
<p>The stubborn me, however, retorted with merciless ridicule. I replied: "I am unwilling to force a smile because I am not the claw of an invader, but to tell you the truth, I am tired of washing my face with tears. Why don't you retrieve the laughter of the past, from the hands of the invaders?"</p>
<p>Living silently in tears only depletes the power of battle. I don't want to be too happy, and I don't want to be too sad.</p>
<p>It's not that there are no smiles: those who willingly kill themselves laugh because of stupidity. Those who eat their own kind laugh because of barbarism, those who flatter bandits and take them as fathers laugh because of ignorance, and those who are dressed like monkeys laugh because of baseness and filth.</p>
<p>We say: These are smiles, what about tears?</p>
<p>We are indignant at their shamelessness, can we not pity their ignorance?</p>
<p>"It's not a time for laughter." So the worriers are startled and vigilant. They "lament" the past that has disappeared all day long. They do not "seek" laughter.</p>
<p>I don't want to be shameless, and I don't want to be a worrier.</p>
<p>I have many unfortunate stories, and I cannot avoid sorrow. Like many people: smiles are lost, and what is left is tears. Without smiles, unwilling to smile and unable to smile. However, I am also unwilling to let the tears in the box flow forever, making me a laughingstock for the invaders, and also corroding my own strength. I suppressed my sorrow. My tears, unwilling to flow and unable to flow.</p>
<p>I seek laughter. Not from the past, the past often leads to "nostalgia", not from today, today easily becomes "shameless", I often entrust laughter to the near future. This is the time for true laughter, this is the time to refine laughter with tears.</p>
<p>It is necessary to seize what we had from the hands of the invaders. I forge my emotions to be as iron: neither laughing nor crying.</p>
<h3>Learning to Be Mature</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>It seems that there is such a saying in society: "Mature" is another name for "useless." Since society has come to admire flowery words, cunning and hypocrisy, mature people have all been eliminated, leaving them with no place to stand in life and no place to be buried in death. Therefore, everyone regards them as "idiots," "stubborn," "suckers," "dupes"—in a word, as useless people, whom everyone deeply hates and detests. As a result, everyone is afraid of being called "mature" by others and often mocks others as being mature. It seems that the term "mature" will become an ominous term, and the quality of being mature will become a bad quality.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that there is another group of people in society who are desperately advocating maturity. What exactly is going on?</p>
<p>Some elderly fathers, elder brothers, or teachers will say to younger siblings or students that young people must be mature. A young person who is mature will surely become great in the future. The most unacceptable thing is to talk about love all the time, and for men and women to go out together on the street, or sit together in public: behavior is frivolous and indecent. What they say is of course correct, because for them, matters between men and women are at most things they do secretly, climbing over the neighbor's wall to "embrace his daughter," which others cannot see and does not harm their maturity. They will also say that the relationship between husband and wife is one of the five cardinal relationships, how important it is, but young people's blood is unsettled, and they talk about divorce at the drop of a hat. What they say is of course also correct, because they have their own mature method: "Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is to have no descendants"—taking a concubine. Even a beggar from Qi had a wife and a concubine, as seen in Mencius; taking a concubine is, without a doubt, a mature behavior.</p>
<p>Some wealthy bosses, compradors, or chiefs or managers will lecture younger employees: young people must be mature; if they are mature, they can gain the trust of the boss or superiors, and will have great prospects in the future. Under the pressure of obedience, the young employees naturally want to do their best to be mature, to exhaust the capabilities of maturity, and to die without regret. Fortunately, these superiors are superior, and these young employees mostly do not know why. They only see them wearing long gowns and mandarin jackets, behaving in a proper manner, truly very mature. But they have no way of participating in the secret affairs of stealing the sky and changing the sun, and embezzling public funds for private gain, and all kinds of super-mature behaviors.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other people who claim to be mature themselves and advise others to be mature. Even rickshaw pullers will say to you when bargaining, "Regular price, two jiao (cents) of silver." Being "regular," isn't that maturity?</p>
<p>However, this kind of persuasion to learn maturity is, after all, not very effective, because the speaker is earnest, but the listener is indifferent, which has already become the norm. If the speaker's careful planning and fine words and deeds were once thoroughly understood by the listener, just like seeing the liver and lungs, then they would mislead all those who learn to be mature. Only those young people who are willing to learn maturity themselves can their learning be deeply rooted and become great talents.</p>
<p>I often see many young people walking with square steps, fearing to step on ants; when they sit down, they bend their waists and backs, bowing as if they were greeting someone; the sound of coughing and spitting is constant in their throats and from their mouths, spreading dense and light pearls everywhere in the wind; a cigarette in hand, never leaving their grasp, but never actually going into their mouths, so their fingers are yellowed, and they are qualified to be old; either wearing Western clothes, there must be a button missing, and their trouser legs hang up to their shins, so you could easily knock on them with a cane; or wearing Chinese clothes, they must love its original color, and must change its original shape, saying that famous scholars do not care about their appearance; when talking or writing to people, they address those older than them, such as their grandparents, fathers, or teachers, as brothers, because they know that Confucius studied with Xiang Tuo, and Gan Luo became Prime Minister at twelve, because it is said that there is a sequence to learning and specialization in studies, which has nothing to do with age; being skilled at thresholds, calling themselves old thresholds, being familiar with Shanghai, calling themselves old Shanghai; whenever they open their mouths or pick up a pen, it is always about something that happened several years ago, how I was then, and how I am now, reflecting on the past and feeling emotional; or whenever they open their mouths or pick up a pen, they teach people, as if they have a unique secret, which can be sold like a savage's head...</p>
<p>These young people are truly geniuses; what others learn to no avail by the age of forty or fifty, they can, between the ages of fifteen and thirty, learn as soon as they set their minds to it, and they can learn to be vivid and lifelike. Therefore, they become literary giants and writers in the cultural world; they become leaders and tycoons in the business world; in some other world, they become big shots, all-rounders, and people who can get things done... I respect and admire them the most. Once, when I was eating half a baby chicken, I used all my strength but couldn't chew it at all. Someone said that this chicken is a mature young person, so I respectfully and reverently pushed it aside, not daring, and especially not bearing, to eat it again.</p>
<p>So, who says that "mature" is another name for "useless"? We should learn it; whether passively or actively, it's all the same when it comes to success. Once they breathe their last, they can also earn the eulogy of "the withering of maturity," which would not bring glory to their resting place!</p>
<h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>This publication has never engaged in "pen wars" with other publications, and the editor personally dislikes this kind of thing, even more so. Therefore, this publication always tries to be careful with any text that could cause misunderstanding. As for those who are deliberately nitpicking, this publication will not participate. Unsolicited manuscripts that take up sides or counter attack, this publication will not include, please forgive us. The reason is very simple: this kind of "pen war" is only destructive, and it shouldn't happen normally, especially not during this time when the whole country is united in resistance against the Japanese. If there is free time, I hope everyone will write more constructive articles.</p>

<h3>The Aftermath of Refugees</h3>
<p>— Baiqiang</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, an Aftermath Committee was set up, and there was also an Aftermath Department within the Secretariat. The former focuses on suggestions, while the latter is engaged in execution. But what is called aftermath? And what are the Aftermath Committee and the Aftermath Department doing? I think this is not only what the refugees in the various shelters hope to know, but also what people from all walks of life who care about the refugee issue may also want to know.</p>
<p>The so-called refugee aftermath is to help refugees become self-reliant and reduce the burden on society. In general, there are many refugees who are unwilling to be supported for a long time and are willing to seek their own way. These refugees originally had no home to return to in the shelters and had nothing to do. Due to the impact of the war, they had no choice but to be temporarily supported in the shelters. But their conscience, their ambition, will never be trapped like this for long! The Aftermath Department of the Association will also provide appropriate arrangements on this point, helping them open a bright path and find a suitable direction and destination in the future course of their lives. In this way, the refugee problem can be solved, and the stability of social order and the promotion of national construction can also be solved. The relationship between common interests and losses is actually very important. At present, the methods adopted by the Aftermath Committee and the Aftermath Department of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association include three types: First, for refugees who can leave Shanghai and go to relatives and friends, provide boat tickets, or travel expenses of two to twelve yuan. Second, for refugees with a skill, introduce suitable occupations to all walks of life based on their abilities and experience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, and industrial and commercial firms will enthusiastically support the promotion of refugees' livelihoods. Third, for refugees who cannot leave Shanghai and have no special skills and no occupation to introduce, plans will be made to train them. Various production undertakings will be run by the Association itself or jointly with industrial and commercial circles to accommodate them. In addition, special refugees, such as the disabled, the elderly, and orphans, will also be given special attention separately in the future. A vacant lot has now been designated on Dunxin Road, which is planned as the site of the orphanage in the future.</p>
<p>In short, all this aftermath work still requires a lot of help from society to have good results. May everyone work hard on the refugee aftermath.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Rescue Piggy Bank Movement</h3>
<p>— Han Mei</p>
<p>Relief for refugees will not be effective without a long-term and sustained effort. Because the war has not ended, and the refugees in the war zone cannot return home safely. The Refugee Relief Association, in view of this, has been coordinating accommodation, support, education, and production since its establishment, and has achieved satisfactory results. All the living expenses of the refugees are also entirely dependent on the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life to continue their lives. Moreover, because the days are long and the funds are urgently needed, it is necessary to establish various fundraising methods to raise this amount of funds. We should express our sympathy for the various painstaking efforts of the organizers and give them enthusiastic support. Among these many fundraising methods, I most approve of the Rescue Piggy Bank Movement promoted by the fellow villagers' groups, because this kind of saving for rescue is easy, meaningful, and only requires the correct promotion method to sustain it for a long time, and there are no drawbacks. If each family, or each school or store, can receive one, and implement savings on a daily or monthly basis to help refugees, then one family is not much, but ten families are many. When collected together, it will be very considerable. Moreover, this method can arouse the interest of the general public and cultivate the habit of saving for disaster relief in every family. The so-called taking without hurting integrity is the most practical. Everyone deserves to advocate and practice it. If it can be persevered, it will be of great benefit to the disaster relief movement.</p>

<h3>Reading the Newspaper (2)</h3>
<p>— Tan Tian</p>
<p>Newspapers publish almost every day an article that criticizes current events. This kind of text is generally called an "editorial." The entire text inevitably represents the position and the ideology of the newspaper. Therefore, the true meaning of "editorial" is to give a fair criticism of the current problems and the evolution of facts, to provide a correct analysis, to arouse the public, to guide the public, and to supervise the government as a principle. Therefore, many editorials can now be unified under the slogan of resisting the enemy in unity. Even foreign merchants' newspapers can make righteous appeals from a sympathetic standpoint, which can be our reference. However, the names of editorials in many newspapers are now different. Some are labeled "Current Commentary," some are labeled "Commentary Forum," some are labeled "Editorial Commentary," and some are labeled "Commentary." All of these are alternative names for editorials. In addition, in the position of the editorial, sometimes an editorial is not published, but an outside contribution is published. This is called "External Commentary" or "Replacement Commentary," which means that the newspaper fully approves of that article. In short, it is also an editorial.</p>
<p>Public Opinion　One of the functions of newspapers is to form public opinion. This means that if the various news or opinions published in the newspaper can be approved by the majority of readers, then public opinion is formed. Public opinion is the combined opinion of the majority, and it is a reflection of social consciousness. It occurs naturally. Although modern countries often use the news censorship system to suppress public opinion and transform public opinion, public opinion will still occur when one of the following situations is encountered: 1. Government errors policies are pointed out by knowledgeable people; 2. Government oppression is too severe, and the oppressed resolutely resist; 3. The oppressed expand the united strength against the oppressors. In short, the power of public opinion is very powerful. As the saying goes, "If a thousand people point the finger at you, you will surely die." A person cannot last long if they are scolded everywhere.</p>
<p>Advertising　Advertising is a weapon in the commercial war in capitalist society. Merchants must use advertisements to call on people to buy their goods, and we don't need to explain this. Living in Shanghai is like living in an advertising nest. When walking on the road, you see advertisements. When living at home, you hear advertisements. Wherever there is a place that can attract attention, there are advertisements, and newspapers are the only medium for advertisements. Therefore, general people's weddings, funerals, statements, and apologies must use advertisements, and disaster relief, fundraising, acting, and train operation times also use advertisements. This is of course reasonable, but now there are many people who specialize in advertising and cause people to fall into the trap. Like drug and fortune-telling advertisements, there are many that are unreliable. Now advertising is becoming more and more advanced, and there is even something called "supplemental advertising." This method uses the supplement as a gimmick to receive the actual advertising effect, because these guys all use some kind of specialized knowledge to claim their status, and it is not easy for those who have not studied it to see through it.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Report</h3>
<p>— Wu Guang</p>
<p>This week's war situation shows that the Chinese army, taking advantage of the remaining strength from last week, has been applying pressure to the Japanese army. In both the northern and southern battlefields, many important cities and towns have been reported as recaptured. As of now, the war is continuing to unfold. A brief account of the situation on each front is provided below.</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>In the Zengcheng area, Japanese troops have been launching offensives towards Pingfeng Ridge and Huluding in two directions for several days. The Chinese army is bravely resisting and has closely surrounded Zengcheng. In the Conghua area, Japanese troops are advancing towards Dawo Lang and Bie Wei. The Chinese army is flanking them from both sides, disrupting Japanese communication and causing significant losses. On both sides of the Xijiang River, in the areas of Xinhui and Jiangmen, fierce fighting continues. The strongholds of Makou, Xinxu, and Dagang have been successively recaptured. As for Hainan Island, Japanese troops also launched offensives towards Ding'an and Shu'an, but the Chinese army, resting and waiting, fiercely resisted. Simultaneously, another unit of the Chinese army seized the opportunity to recapture the city of Ding'an.</p>
<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>In Nanchang's Xiangtang, Japanese troops, using aircraft and artillery cover, repeatedly engaged the Chinese army in decisive battles, but the Chinese army has remained steadfast. Recently, the Chinese army bravely attacked, causing the Japanese to retreat towards Nanchang. Consequently, Xiangtang and the county seat of Gao'an were recaptured. The Chinese army, pressing the attack, regained control of Dachen. The Japanese army, unwilling to accept defeat, launched a large-scale counterattack, resulting in intense fighting. Later, due to a significant disparity in numbers, the Chinese army in Gao'an withdrew to its original positions. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Wuning have been continuously counter-attacked by the Chinese army, leading to a fierce battle for control of the west side of the city. The situation is currently at a stalemate.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>The Chinese army in eastern Hubei recently recaptured Lvwang City, Hekou Town, and Wangjia Shop and is currently encircling and annihilating the Japanese troops inside Huang'an City. The Chinese army in northern Hubei, a formidable force advancing on Yingshan and Anlu, continued its advance towards the county seat after recovering Haojia'an. The Japanese army has retreated towards Xiaogan. The Chinese army in central Hubei is successfully besieging Zhongxiang. The Japanese army in Wuhan, due to the Chinese army in eastern, northern, and central Hubei successively capturing key locations, is strengthening fortifications in an attempt to fight a decisive battle.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>The Japanese troops advancing towards the Zhongtiao Mountains, after being repelled last week, are now active again. The Chinese army rushed to launch a fierce attack, causing them to retreat once more. The Japanese troops in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi in eastern Shanxi have launched fierce offensives towards various locations south of Pingyao for several days, but have made no progress. The Japanese troops in Huo County, after their unsuccessful attack on Yangjiazhuang last week, launched another eastward offensive this week. After a week of fighting, their offensive has significantly weakened.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 3,000 Japanese troops in Xinyang, Henan Province, divided into three routes, one crossing the river at Xishuang River, one heading towards Yangliu River, and another approaching Xichuan, attempting to break through the encirclement and engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army attacking Xinyang. The Chinese army launched attacks on multiple fronts, breaking through the Japanese positions. The encirclement is now shrinking. The Chinese army near Kaifeng suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the city walls before noon on the 11th, completely occupying all the key points and stations in the suburbs. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted in the city, but were ultimately repelled by the Chinese army. Subsequently, the Chinese army stormed into the city, recapturing the city walls, and intense fighting continues.</p>

<h3>Refugees</h3>
<p>— A Refugee Recorder</p>
<p>Some people get a headache at the mere mention of refugees.</p>
<p>They look down on refugees, considering them lowly, dirty, ignorant, and the dregs of society.</p>
<p>But let us think for ourselves. Among our comrades, there are also very capable people, very knowledgeable people. We should strive to rise up and earn the respect of society!</p>
<p>Naturally, dirtiness and foolishness are unavoidable. I think we should educate each other, supervise each other, and encourage each other, so as not to fail society's love, care, and expectations for us.</p>
<h3>Dunshen Road First Shelter</h3>
<p>— Chun Fan</p>
<p>The Dunshen Road First Shelter is a newly established shelter. Precisely because it is newly established, we have new expectations for it, namely, that everything lacking in the equipment, management, and education of other shelters can be perfected in this new shelter. I heard from others that the Dunshen Road First Shelter is run very well, but I had never really known for sure. This time, I took some time to visit the shelter, and I felt that the First Shelter is not only first in name but also deserving of the title of "first" in terms of its performance. I will briefly introduce it below.</p>
<p>Before the war, everyone knew about the establishment of the Shanghai Public Village, right? – A towering gate, rows of houses, with crisscrossing lanes and complete facilities, including schools, squares, and recreation rooms. The impression of it remains vivid in my mind. This time, when I drove to the Dunshen Road First Shelter and looked around, it resembled a large village, with the same spirit as the Public Village. A memorial arch-style gate stood tall in the air, with the words "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association First Shelter" inscribed by Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Inside the gate was a square, with a main road in the middle and refugee reception rooms, security rooms, general offices, service centers, photography rooms, and refugee housing areas arranged on both sides. It looked tidy, clean, solemn, and quiet, making one breathe freely. To be honest, this situation is probably much better than living in a garret or kitchen in Shanghai, where people are suffocated by stuffy air and smog! I secretly congratulate the refugees. At the end is the fire station, with a fire engine parked inside to ensure safety. One can imagine how well-equipped the shelter is.</p>
<p>Facilities: The facilities include 19 districts, accommodating more than 5,000 refugees. The districts are divided as follows: the first district is the staff area, where staff families reside; the second district is the women's area, where female refugees reside; the third to seventh districts (and the eleventh, fourteenth, and eighteenth districts) are the family areas, where refugees with families reside; the eighth district is the disabled area, where disabled refugees reside; the ninth district is the single children's area, where orphaned children reside; the tenth district is the women and children's area, where women and children without fathers or husbands reside; the tenth and thirteenth districts are the single men's areas; and the nineteenth district is the vagrant area, where street vagrants reside. The division of districts is extremely reasonable and facilitates management, and the order is excellent. I patrolled the districts and asked people questions. Each so-called district is a large wooden building with ample sunlight and air. The refugees are all on wooden beds, which are stacked like bunk beds in a small hotel. This method is economical, does not take up space, and is also very aesthetically pleasing. Each district has two district chiefs who live near the entrance. They share the joys and hardships of the refugees, and manage affairs by setting an example. Therefore, everything related to supplies and sanitation is well-organized, which is commendable.</p>
<p>The shelter occupies a large area, surrounded by bamboo walls. For safety, it is further surrounded by barbed wire. There are many toilets and bathrooms for convenience. During my inspection of the area, I saw service centers that sell daily necessities to refugees, storage areas that store refugee supplies and belongings, and recreation rooms that provide refugees with entertainment and games. In addition, I also visited the kitchen, stove room, and laundry room. In the refugee clinic, I spoke with a patient who told me that the clinic is affiliated with the Red Cross and operates very diligently. Many patients have been cured under the responsible care of doctors and nurses. The patient, groaning in bed, told me, "Oh! Heaven and earth! The doctors and nurses here are really good!"</p>
<p>Management: I have already mentioned some aspects of the management earlier. In fact, the management of the First Shelter is no different from that of other shelters in Shanghai, but the rigor and thoroughness of the management are the characteristics of the First Shelter. Mr. Cai Renbao, the director of the shelter's general management office, is usually very diligent in his work, and especially strict in the management of the First Shelter. Mr. Cai has established regulations: no corruption, no malpractice, no smoking, no drinking. Whether staff or refugees, everyone is treated equally and abides by the regulations together. I saw that everyone in the shelter not only strictly adhered to the bans on smoking and drinking, but also could not spit casually. Moreover, there were tip boxes everywhere so that anyone could report illegal activities.</p>
<p>Regarding the entry and exit of refugees, each person has an entry and exit pass, which allows them to go out once a day. Special management personnel are responsible for issuing and collecting the passes. Refugees living in the shelter all wear badges indicating their place of origin, district, and number, and family members are also clearly identified. If there is an incident, it is easy to find out. Moreover, refugees must be photographed for record-keeping. Refugees who are adopted must also have a photograph taken with their adoptive parents for remembrance. According to the refugees, Mr. Cai personally gives a pep talk every morning in the shelter, which is broadcast to all districts via loudspeaker. Afterwards, there are broadcasts of music and storytelling, which are broadcast separately to entertain the audience. I have seen refugees sitting quietly, listening to the pep talk, which is also a good form of spiritual education.</p>
<p>Refugees: (1) I also asked about the refugees' lives. They have two meals a day, one porridge and one rice. They eat porridge at 10 a.m. and rice in the afternoon. Each person receives a piece of dried radish for each meal to eat with rice. Life is very hard, beyond the imagination of those who live in luxury. In the women and children's area, I spoke with a refugee child. Our conversation went like this: "My father was bombed to death on August 13th. My mother and I live here together. When my mother does laundry, we have some vegetables to eat, not always."</p>
<p>"Do you get to wash clothes every day?" "Only seven or eight times a month."</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?" "Thirteen." "You should help your mother with work!" "I used to scavenge (Note: meaning garbage), but because I couldn't beat others, my mother told me not to scavenge anymore." "So you don't have any vegetables to eat?"</p>
<p>(The child giggles.) "Hey! I'm asking you, how many bowls of rice do you eat?" "Four bowls." "Do you eat that much?" "If I don't eat a lot, I'll be hungry at night." "If that's the case, why don't you save some rice to eat at night?" (Everyone laughs!) "I can't, stealing rice will get me punished!" (Note: "Punished" means to be penalized).</p>
<p>The child's words are reasonable and touched my infinite sympathy. Alas! His situation should be borne by the warmongering imperialists.</p>
<p>In my observation, women and children are more active among the refugees. They are dissatisfied with refugee life and feel that being a refugee and receiving assistance from others is shameful. Therefore, they take every opportunity to find work. Some help people wash clothes, some help people assemble fans, some sew edges, and some weave towels. If they can't find anything to do, they mend and wash clothes for their children. They all come from poor families, and perhaps due to the habits of life, they have developed a hardworking nature. The children are also very robust. It seems that as long as there is something for them to do, they are happy to do it. Only the vagrants and a few men are lazy by nature. They seem to have little interest in self-reliance. In addition, many men are working outside on short-term jobs. It is very necessary for the Association authorities to establish refugee factories in the very near future so that refugees have the opportunity to be employed, turning consumption into production.</p>
<p>Education: (1) Education is quite important in refugee shelters. The First Shelter's education is divided into adult and children's education, and is overseen by Mr. Chen Heqin. When I walked into the children's playground (i.e., the children's school), I saw many students drilling, with orderly rows and full of spirit. Everyone was very happy. Another group of young children were in class, and the teacher was telling a story. They sat on small stools and listened attentively. Unfortunately, due to the situation, I had little contact with the school, especially with adult education, which I didn't see at all. I said goodbye very hastily.</p>
<p>In summary, I have not been able to fully describe the detailed situation of the First Shelter, especially its characteristics in management and the perfection of its facilities. There will inevitably be omissions. Fortunately, I will have the opportunity to describe it again in the future. Now I will stop writing.</p>

<h3>Shanghai City Construction Before the War (I)</h3>
<p>— Lin Lang</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major international port, with a population of over three million. Before the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), there was virtually no municipal construction to speak of. In the past, visitors often praised the wide and open roads, with a constant flow of traffic, but this was only in reference to the two special districts, the "Public Concession and the French Concession," and not the Chinese-administered city area. During the warlord era, the Nanshi and Zhabei districts each had their own public works and police donation bureaus, operating in a perfunctory and simple manner, with no initial achievements. Furthermore, the Shanghai Commercial Port Commissioner's Office lacked a sound organizational structure, and its effectiveness was inherently weak. Coupled with its short duration and financial difficulties, it was also unable to achieve any significant results.</p>
<p>The discussion of Shanghai's municipal construction should begin from the 16th year of the Republic of China. The first mayor, Mr. Huang Yingbai, followed the teachings of the Premier and sought to realize the Greater Shanghai Plan. Upon taking office, he had a concrete plan for the urban area and various constructions. At that time, the municipal government had just been established, and various bureaus were being set up one after another. Local public opinion was concerned that the scale was too large and the expenses were too great. Mr. Yingbai strongly rejected these objections, stating the following:</p>
<p>'Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and is watched by both domestic and international communities. All construction must be undertaken. Financial resources should indeed be cherished, and human resources should be valued. There must be sufficient reserves and appropriate use, so that construction projects can proceed smoothly. If we strive for reduction and are conservative in everything, then the Greater Shanghai Plan will be nothing more than empty words, which is not the way to adapt to circumstances. We should use our wisdom to decide on legislation and policy implementation, then use courage to implement it, and finally use perseverance to achieve it. This is what we ought to do. Why worry about frivolous words? Facts will be the answer in the future.'</p>
<p>After Mr. Yingbai left office, Mayor Zhang Boxuan succeeded him, continuing to work hard following the previous administration's policies. When Mayor Zhang Yuejun took office, he put in even more painstaking planning and diligent management, and the framework of Greater Shanghai began to take shape. After Mayor Wu Tiecheng took office, he further developed and expanded it, putting the original plan into practice. As a result, Shanghai's construction was splendid and well-prepared. Therefore, when discussing Shanghai's municipal construction, Mr. Huang Yingbai formulated the plan and laid the foundation, Mayor Zhang Boxuan and Mayor Zhang Yuejun followed the path and completed most of it, and Mayor Wu continued his efforts to achieve this great undertaking. The citizens of Shanghai have a consistent spirit towards the past leaders, creating welfare for the citizens and realizing the Premier's plan, always keeping it in mind, and it should be permanently engraved in their hearts and never forgotten.</p>
<p>To speak of the municipal construction of Greater Shanghai, there are countless aspects, and it is difficult to know where to start. What is described below is only about the most important aspects. We assume that Shanghai's municipal construction can be divided into three phases: expanding the roads in Nanshi and Zhabei and reorganizing existing public utilities as the first phase; developing urban traffic and opening roads as the second phase; and constructing the city center area as the third phase. We will conduct a detailed study of the construction in these three phases. Whether it belongs to the local or central government, it is all part of the entire plan to prosper Greater Shanghai and cannot be neglected. Now, the essence of the entire city has been destroyed in one fell swoop. For Shanghai alone, it is truly regrettable. For the entire country, it is not enough to express regret, because what the enemy can destroy is our material, but what they cannot destroy is our spirit. Without destruction, there is no way to build. Today's great destruction may well be the prelude to great construction in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shanghai's municipal construction has only been around for ten years, a very short period, but the grandeur of the planning has reached the level of a modern city. The day the enemy collapses will be the time for us to rebuild. If we are given another ten years, the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration is unimaginable. Is it a pity? Is it destruction?</p>
<p>(A) Construction of the City Center Area</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, once said in his proposed Greater Shanghai Plan: "Although Shanghai has now become the largest commercial port in China, if it remains unchanged, it will not be able to meet the needs and requirements of becoming a world commercial port in the future..." The past mayors of Shanghai have spared no effort in promoting the realization of Dr. Sun's Greater Shanghai Plan, transforming Shanghai's commercial port to adapt to the global trend. One of the most important aspects is the construction of the "core" city center area of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>The establishment of Shanghai's urban area and its various construction plans began during the time of the first mayor, Huang Fu. The determination of the city center area was decided in the 112th and 113th municipal conferences in July of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929). At that time, it was stipulated that an area of approximately 7,000 mu (approximately 1,155 acres) north of Xiangyin Road in the Jiangwan District, south of Zhayin Road, east of Songhu Road, and west of Tu Yi Wu Tu in Zhou Nan Shi Tu, would be the city center area. In August of the same year, the "Shanghai City Center Area Construction Committee" was established to oversee design matters. Subsequently, all land and water transportation, road systems, zoning plans, and ditch docks were gradually carried out according to plan. By July of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), when the municipal government held its tenth-anniversary celebration, various constructions had become quite impressive, marking the end of a decade of creation and management. Unfortunately, a month later, the "August 13th" Incident broke out, and this splendid city center area was transformed into a field of rubble in an instant. When we look back on the past, we cannot help but feel grief and indignation! However, what people can destroy, we can build. The time to recover and expand it is not far away. The following is a summary of the important constructions in the city center area:</p>
<p>Water and Land Transportation The development of the city center area is closely related to water and land transportation. Therefore, the construction plan for its transportation includes the opening of the Wusong Port by waterway and the rerouting of the city's railway line by land. The purpose of opening Wusong Port is to adapt to the future prosperity of Shanghai, with the intention of using Wusong as a dock area to accommodate large foreign ships. It is also planned to dig a canal at a suitable location to connect Yunzaobang and Wusong River to facilitate transportation. This plan was not realized due to the large amount of funds required. The promotion of land transportation began with the rerouting of the existing railway, and the plan was as follows: Assume that a branch line is built near Zhenru, passing north through Dachang, east of Hujiazhuang, and turning east along the east bank of Yunzaobang to the Wusong River area, connecting to the commercial port and the Qiujiang dock; another branch line is diverted from Zhenru, passing through Pengpu to Jiangwan, to serve as the future Shanghai Central Station. During the "January 28th" Incident, this station was destroyed. The Ministry of Railways adopted the municipal government's suggestion and decided to use the area near Pengpu Zhongshan Road as the joint transportation headquarters for the two lines, but it was also abandoned due to funding issues. Building a bridge across the Huangpu River is also one of the plans to promote water and land transportation. The bridge locations are: one at the eastern end of Wuquan Road, which can connect to Gaohang and Gaoqiao districts in Pudong on the opposite bank; and one near Longhua Mouth, in preparation for the future extension of the railway line to Pudong, connecting the transportation lines in Pudong and Puxi.</p>
<p>Roads and Ditches According to the city center area road system plan, there are more than 200 roads in total, which can be divided into two points: First, trunk roads, extending in all four directions from the city center area, like rays of starlight, to connect commercial ports, docks, and various urban areas. Those that have been built are: Qimei Road, Huangxing Road, Sanmin Road, Wuquan Road, Shijie Road, Datong Road, Songhu Road, Jungong Road, Shuidian Road, Zhayin Road, and part of Zhongshan North Road. Second, secondary roads are built to facilitate commerce and transportation in the city center area and its surrounding areas. The city center area is divided into five sub-districts: northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest, and central, by Shijie Road, Datong Road, Sanmin Road, and Wuquan Road. Except for the central district, which has road names prefixed with "Fu" (府), the longitudinal roads in the northeast district have road names prefixed with "Zhong" (中), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Shang" (上). The longitudinal roads in the southeast district are prefixed with "Hua" (華), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Hai" (海). The longitudinal roads in the northwest district are prefixed with "Min" (民), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Shi" (市). The longitudinal roads in the southwest district are prefixed with "Guo" (國), and the transverse roads are prefixed with "Zheng" (政). Therefore, within the city center area, the longitudinal roads are sequentially prefixed with the characters "Zhong" (中), "Hua" (華), "Min" (民), and "Guo" (國). The transverse roads are sequentially prefixed with the characters "Shang" (上), "Hai" (海), "Shi" (市), and "Zheng" (政). The road names in the central part are all prefixed with "Fu" (府). The roads in the first and second requisition areas, and the municipal government employee requisition area, have a total length of 119 kilometers. Among them, the trunk roads connecting to the old urban area are: Qimei Road, connecting Disiwei Road from the intersection of Xiangyin Road and Songhu Road, with a total length of 5.025 kilometers and a width of 35 meters; Huangxing Road, connecting Songhu Road in the city center area and Ningguo Road in Yangshupu, with a total length of 11.65 kilometers and an actual width of 30 meters; Xiangyin Road, a major traffic artery connecting Zhabei District and North Sichuan Road. The ditches in the city center area adopt a combined system, and the layout of each ditch pipe adopts a radial pattern due to the terrain. Through several years of construction, the ditch pipes in the first and second requisition areas and the employee requisition area have been completely buried, with a total length of 36 kilometers.</p>
<p>Zoning The city center area is divided into three major areas, namely: 1. The administrative area, located in the central part of the city center area, where all administrative agencies and important public buildings, such as the municipal government and various bureaus, the municipal council, the party headquarters, the library, the museum, and the aviation association, are built. 2. Residential and commercial areas, all land except for the administrative area and park area is designated for residential and commercial use. The residential area is further divided into two types: those located near the park and open space are used for the construction of high-end residences; other land, not in the above example, is used for the construction of ordinary residences. As of the fall of the previous year, there were distributions of residences, shops, and vegetable markets in the first and second requisition areas. 3. Park and open space area, which includes the First Park, the municipal park branch, and the municipal sports field. Other areas that require open space for municipal hospitals, hygiene experimental institutes, municipal experimental elementary schools, and other public buildings are also built in this area.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Building The construction of the municipal government building was first planned by the Construction Committee to formulate design standards, which are divided into three points: 1. The three-dimensional style of the new municipal government should adopt the Chinese style; 2. The plane layout of the new municipal government should be divided into separate bureaus; 3. The construction steps of the new municipal government should be divided into two parts. After the standards were set, the committee formulated a method of soliciting designs for the new municipal government building with a reward, which began on October 1 of the 18th year (1929). The determined design was based on the architecture of the Palace in Beijing, incorporating modern needs, so that both aesthetics and practicality were combined. In July of the 19th year (1930), an architect's office was established to create all drawings and specifications, which were approved by the municipal conference, and bidding began. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 7, and construction was suspended for five months due to the impact of the "January 28th" Incident. It was completed in October of the 22nd year (1933), and the completion ceremony was held on the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the country. From December 25th, the municipal government began to move into the new building to work, and various bureaus also moved into temporary houses separately. After the outbreak of the August 13th War, the city center area became a war zone, and this towering building was also damaged by Japanese artillery fire. The municipal government building is a Chinese-style building, divided into four floors. From the outside, the first floor is a platform, and above the platform is a two-story palace-style building. The top floor is hidden inside the roof. Inside, the first and third floors are office space, the second floor is a large auditorium, library, and conference room, and the fourth floor is used for storing files, sundries, and housing staff. The total area of each floor is 8,982 square meters; the highest point of the roof is 31 meters above the ground; the total length of the entire building is about 93 meters; the width is 25 meters in the middle and 20 meters on both sides. The exterior adopts a beam-column structure, the roof is covered with green glazed tiles, and the roof ridge is decorated with golden yellow glazed tiles and cement gilded decorations, which is extremely luxurious and solemn. All four sides of the building are equipped with steel doors and windows, and stone steps are built on all four sides of the lower floor. The stone steps on the front reach directly to the front door of the auditorium from the ground outside the house, forming a bridge so that vehicles can directly reach the front door. There are two stone lions and two flagpole platforms next to the steps. Whenever the weather is clear, the Chinese flag with the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flies high on the flagpole, fluttering in the wind, which is pleasing to the eye. The interior layout of the municipal government building combines Chinese and Western styles, focusing on practicality. In terms of the area of each room, the auditorium, library, and dining hall are the largest, as they are for the public use of the entire municipal government, including affiliated bureaus. The municipal government building is a new building, and its electrical equipment is extremely perfect. More innovative features include: telephone conference equipment, for the chairman and ten other people to communicate and hold meetings, so that important staff can hold meetings by telephone without leaving their seats; a search equipment, which can use lights and bells to send 27 kinds of signals in 30 locations, for searching for 27 people; a fire alarm equipment, so that if a fire occurs, the management personnel can immediately know the location of the fire, for emergency disposal. Other small statistics of electrical equipment are as follows: the large reception room is equipped with an electric master clock, with 36 slave clocks attached; the whole house is equipped with 455 electric lights; 18 electric fans and wall fans, 31 ceiling fans; 2 elevators. In addition to electrical equipment, all heating pipes and sanitary equipment are very thoughtful. The total cost of the municipal government building was 780,000 national currency. The electrical appliances and equipment cost about 90,000 yuan. In addition to the municipal government building, the two temporary houses of the five affiliated bureaus of social affairs, education, hygiene, land, and public works cost a total of 214,400 yuan, which started construction in February of the 22nd year (1933) and was completed in July of the same year.</p>
<p>Other Buildings In addition to the municipal government building, the great buildings in the city center area also include sports fields, museums, and libraries. The general situation is described as follows: (1) Municipal Sports Field. Construction began in August of the 23rd year (1934) and was completed in September of the 24th year (1935). The entire site includes a sports field, swimming pool, and gymnasium, covering an area of approximately 300 mu (approximately 49 acres). Three years ago, when the National Games were held in Shanghai, as many as 150,000 people visited the municipal sports field, which was truly a grand event. The cost of the above three parts of the project is estimated to be about 1.15 million yuan. Building a large-scale sports field with such a large amount of money is still a pioneering undertaking in China. The main building of the municipal sports field is the sports field. At the beginning of construction, it was estimated that the field should accommodate at least 60,000 spectators when the National Games were held. However, due to funding limitations, the total number of seats in the field was limited to 50,000, but there is still room for the construction of 20,000 seats. The main purpose of the sports field is for track and field events. There is a football field in the center, and tennis and basketball courts on both ends. The oval-shaped field is 500 meters in total, and the long runways on both sides are 200 meters each. The design of the spectators' seats is novel, and the entrance and exit traffic is extremely convenient, which is its characteristic. The design of ticket sales and management is also advanced. The rest or office buildings for athletes and staff are also quite spacious, accommodating about 2,000 people. The remaining space under the stands is used as much as possible, and is used for paving, lavatories, and ticket sales. There are many flagpoles around the stands, and the colorful flags fluttering on the day of the sports meet add a lot of color to the entire venue. All building materials are steel and cement, but the base is made of red brick and artificial stone, and the outer wall is made of lid stone, because they are both economical and durable. The swimming pool is open-air, with 5,000 seats around it. Under the stands, there are changing rooms, showers, restrooms, paving, lavatories, boiler rooms, and water filter rooms. The pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, built according to the standards of the Far Eastern Games. The deepest consideration in the pool is 11 feet 6 inches, the shallower consideration is 6 feet deep, and the shallowest point is 4 feet, and its shape is "spoon-shaped". The total amount of water in the pool is 600,000 gallons. If you want to change the water from time to time, the cost is very high, and the time to change the water once takes up to 10 hours. The new type of swimming pool popular in the world today has abolished the method of changing water, and replaced it with a water filter. The water filter runs continuously, and every six hours, the water in the entire pool is completely filtered, so the water in the pool is always clean. The light arrangement is also one of the characteristics of this pool. Strong light bulbs are installed on the pool wall below the water surface, and the pool water reflects light at night, which is clear and lovely. The gymnasium is the main venue for indoor sports, and all the arrangements are made in the latest style. The whole venue has 3,500 fixed grandstand seats and 1,500 temporary seats, and can be increased if necessary. The area of the venue is 131 feet by 76 feet, which is enough for three basketball teams. The roof of the gymnasium is arched, the highest ceiling is 63 feet from the floor, the total length of the building is 270 feet, and the total width is 150 feet. After entering the hall, the audience is led to the seats in the tier through two stairs. The entrance area is very spacious, and there are offices, ticket offices, and lavatories on both sides. All building materials, except for the floor and doors, which are made of wood, are steel and cement. The lighting equipment is also good.</p>

<h3>Black and White</h3>
<p>— Luo Xi</p>
<p>"A gentleman loves money, but he earns it in a proper way" is originally a very common and universal principle. However, on the isolated island today, finding a truly "money-loving gentleman" who "earns it in a proper way" is indeed something that can only be done among thousands or tens of thousands!</p>
<p>Who doesn't want money? However, it must be "earned in a proper way"! The so-called "way" does not include all roads that can lead to wealth, but only those that do not violate one's conscience or betray the nation and the people can be called "way"! Can it be that the pseudo-gentlemen who now specialize in seeking personal gain through malpractice, making war profits, shamelessly serving the enemy, and selling evil deeds (such as fraud, drug trafficking, etc.) while "acquiring wealth" are unaware of this principle? No, on the contrary, they often use "seeking welfare for the public" as their slogan. The recent case of malpractice in the charitable organizations in this city is a clear example! They have never been unaware that malpractice, seeking personal gain, serving the enemy, selling evil deeds, and making war profits all result in doing evil and breaking the law. But why do they put up a sheep's head and sell dog meat, knowingly committing crimes? In short, it is only because of "selfishness and self-interest"! Basically, they have not considered "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold."</p>
<p>The full-scale war of resistance has continued to this day, and black and white have been clearly illuminated by the torch of justice. We no longer need to ask these pseudo-gentlemen to show their already blackened conscience. Our only way to deal with them is to severely punish them according to the national law!</p>
<p>Under the illuminating torch of radiant justice, black and white will never be confused!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Children in the Mainland</h3>
<p>— Camon</p>
<p>The Great Achievements of the "Children's Troupe"</p>
<p>A large truck without horses, which is rarely seen elsewhere, drove into a village. On the truck were more than a dozen boys and girls wearing gray uniforms, with earnest expressions on their faces. They delivered letters in the army, posted picture slogans in all the villages, and distributed leaflets to farmers. The villagers were all expressing surprise. They didn't know the words, but they could see things like birds on the pictures throwing eggs down, and women and children being bombed to death.</p>
<p>That afternoon, these newly arrived children held a meeting on an open space in the village. A small, thin-faced child who looked like he was twelve years old stood on a rough platform and said, "China is unified. There is another country called Japan that is attacking China and wants to conquer and divide China." The villagers just stared at each other in amazement. They were wondering who the Japanese were, but the young speaker did not lose courage even though he didn't get any response.</p>
<p>"They come faster than locusts," he said. "In machines that can fly, they will kill you. They will burn your houses, destroy your wives, take your land, and make you slaves... They have already done these things in other villages, and they will do the same in your village." In the crowd, it was as if there was an electric current. They understood these words. Land, were they willing to give it up? Wives, were they willing to be humiliated? Houses, were they willing to have them burned down? They were hoping that these soldiers would be stationed in the village to protect their lives and property. However, the lecturing child seized this moment of psychology and continued to speak:</p>
<p>"We must fight them," he said loudly. "We must drive them out of our country and make them go back to the sea from which they came." Indeed, many villagers in China still don't know these things. These children, who are responsible for publicizing and awakening the villagers, are the Shanghai "Children's Troupe," which is the core of China's "Little Devils."</p>
<p>On the evening of October 27, 1937, Zhabei was on fire, and the whole of Shanghai was in flames. On the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, a team of soldiers guarded the Sihang Warehouse and fought the Japanese in the last heroic resistance, earning the title of "Lone Army" and creating a glorious page in Chinese history. At this time, in a church on Nanjing Road, twenty-one boys and girls gathered in a room to discuss what work they would do in the future. Most of them were boy and girl scouts aged nine to thirteen who had been working in Shanghai for three months rescuing wounded soldiers and delivering messages.</p>
<p>The brave Chinese soldiers (who everyone was sure would win victory for China!) had left Shanghai, but they were determined not to stay behind. After a night of meetings, they decided to take on their wartime responsibilities. After another day of preparations the next day, they didn't tell their parents and took a boat to Nanjing behind their backs. However, the government only regarded the twenty-one of them as refugee children, which made them very disappointed. They had come to help China win, not to live in a reception center. But in the extremely tense situation in Nanjing, their enthusiasm was no longer noticed.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the fall of Nanjing, they decided to go deeper into the mainland again. When they arrived in Xuzhou, they had a total of sixty children and worked in every village they could enter under the name of "Children's Troupe." The people in the villages all regarded them as soldiers, and the local government also knew that the work they were doing was something that children in other countries could not do, creating an amazing page in history. They needed food, and the farmers were also willing to give it to them. Farmers have never had a good impression of soldiers, but they already know that the current soldiers are fighting for China to resist the greedy Japanese.</p>
<p>Later, they went to various places after leaving Chuzhou. In a certain village, they met several representatives of the Eighth Route Army guerrillas who taught them how to perform a play and how to speak to the public. This "Children's Troupe" was officially established in Shanghai two and a half years ago, and now its footprints have spread all over the map of China. The general public is very enthusiastic about their work, and they have become the core of the "Little Devils."</p>

<h3>Training Workers</h3>
<p>— Yu Quan</p>
<p>They do the same work as "official" workers, but receive no wages and even have to pay for "raw material losses."</p>
<p>The term "training worker," when mentioned, might sound unfamiliar to many, right? A worker who is new to the factory and doesn't know how to do the work, who is just starting to learn, is called a "training worker." These workers don't receive wages because they originally don't know how to do the work. They only consume the "raw materials" of the factory and don't actually produce anything. Therefore, "training workers" not only don't receive wages, but some even have to pay the factory a certain amount of "raw material loss fee" each month. Moreover, these workers must work in the factory as "training workers" for five or six months before they can become "official" workers and be paid wages. However, the "raw material loss fee" paid to the factory during these five or six months is already quite substantial. Who knows how many days it will take before the wages they receive are truly the money issued by the factory?</p>
<p>The life of a "training worker" is exactly the same as that of an "official" worker, and they also eat their own food. In the first few days of learning to work, they are naturally not very skilled and must consume some "raw materials." However, after ten days or half a month, the work they do will gradually become more skilled, and what they produce can be exactly the same as what "official" workers produce. It certainly won't take five or six months to learn. Therefore, this is undoubtedly a means for factory-opening capitalists to exploit workers. However, some factories may allow workers to receive wages after one or two months, but this is extremely rare and depends on the "charitable heart" of the capitalist.</p>
<p>Poor people go to work in factories originally hoping to earn some wages to solve their livelihood problems. However, after working hard for the factory, not only do they not receive wages, but they have to pay money to subsidize the factory's "raw material costs." Is there such a reason? However, in the eyes of capitalists, besides money, there is absolutely no such thing as "humanity," "charity," or "human sympathy." They only try every possible method to exploit and extract workers, treating the workers' sweat and blood as the only tool for making money. In a capitalist society, when will impoverished workers see the light of day?</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, is Life a Stage Play? When to Advance or Retreat, Making Home Wherever You Are.</p>
<p>After Xiangzi returned, she was able to accompany her lonely father. However, the family was extremely poor. Her father was originally a university professor, but now he was unemployed. Her elder brother had always been an entrepreneur, but after joining the army, he had to abandon his job. Although their government provided subsidies for soldiers going to war, it later became only nominal. Therefore, they could no longer live in the city and had to move to the countryside. At this time, Xiangzi still couldn't let people know that she had married a Chinese man, and being divorced by a Chinese man would make people look down on her even more. However, the people in the countryside were even more likely to ask questions and pry into her affairs, and sometimes even deliberately spread rumors about her. Moreover, because Xiangzi was exceptionally beautiful and known as a beauty, a group of lecherous men in the countryside coveted her, causing her to constantly defend herself. Fortunately, she later gave birth to a baby boy. The laughter of children in the house could somewhat soothe the loneliness. The three of them, grandfather, granddaughter, and great-grandson, lived in the countryside, barely making ends meet. However, unfortunate news came: her brother had died in battle in the Xiang-E area of inland China. His remains could not be returned to his hometown. Only a jar of ashes was returned to the country, and it was unknown whether it was her brother's or not. Xiangzi and her brother had a very good relationship, and she cried as if her heart would break. Her old father only had this one son, so he was naturally even more grief-stricken. Because he was old and had suffered such hardship, he spent his days writing in the air, sighing in despair. He thought: It's all the fault of the domestic warlords. If they weren't ambitious and wantonly invading other countries, there wouldn't have been any war. If there hadn't been any war, we could have lived and worked in peace and contentment. Why would we have suffered such a fate of losing our daughter and having our family broken? Today, wouldn't we still be a modestly prosperous family with all our members together? He was an old teacher who liked to write. In his anger and resentment, he wrote an article, an anti-aggression and anti-war treatise. However, this article caused a major problem. After being reported, the old teacher was imprisoned. The old teacher was already heartbroken over the loss of his son. How could he withstand the suffering of imprisonment? He soon died. At this time, Xiangzi had no one left in her family. She thought that there was nothing to keep her in her country anymore, so she might as well go to China. When she got to China, she could hide in some remote rural area for a few years. Because she already spoke fluent Chinese and had gotten used to wearing Chinese clothes, she had long since become naturalized in China, and no one could tell that she was a Japanese woman. When she got to China, if she was lucky enough to meet Mr. Chen, she could return this little child to him, preserving a bit of his bloodline. Then my wish would be fulfilled. (88)</p>
