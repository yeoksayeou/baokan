<h3 id="c9">英國維持法幣政策之檢討 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>英國輿論僉以維持中國法幣爲言，彼首相張伯倫，財相西門，外相哈里法克斯，外决勃特勒，亦輒以維持中國法幣，昭告其上下院議員；朝野同情，至足稱道。夫以英國金鎊經濟之力量，具有維持法幣之決心，宜可一掃陰霾之氣矣，顧實際影響何似乎？</p>
<p>匝月以來，上海金融市塲動盪不寗，黑匯之率頻頻短縮，黃金之值步步上騰，投機者以黃金外幣爲蹴鞠，以法幣爲博注，馴致百物飛漲，平民憔悴。此一現象，爲上海金融計，爲五百萬居民計，未可忽視；顧吾人以爲問題性質之嚴重，初非盡在於此。誠以孤島成爲國際特區，雖逈殊於淪陷區域，然與內地究屬不同；外匯無法控制，進出口無法管理，五方雜處，人事錯綜，蔚爲貨幣戰爭之前綫。法幣之於上海，旣爲中國方面之主力，亦爲國際貿易之媒介，同時又爲日本方面資爲進攻之彈藥，復爲投機者取爲基本之籌碼，因此種種深刻之矛盾，自未易調整之於至善。申言之：高抬幣值，於是正當工商活潑，中外居民皆大歡喜，而企圖破壞法幣者，亦欣欣然於套取外滙之自此得以少許勝多許；低抑幣值，於是百業維艱，一般生活困難，而企圖破壞法幣者亦事倍而功半焉。甚矣，兩難也。</p>
<p>竊以爲趨利避害，並非絕無辦法；辦法容或難期盡效盡善，然必差勝於放任。放任之大害，在於動搖法幣信用；信用之維持，要非可以口舌爭。例如英國屢作維持法幣之表示，曾無新毫影響及於上海黑市所流露之人心，此其故不可深長思之乎？或則以爲英國雖表示如彼，不但口惠而實不至，抑且有南轅北轍之嫌。例如最近英倫方面散佈消息謂中國新印鈔票十萬萬張，以每張一元計算，已有十萬萬元，何况票面尚不止於此，是其爲額大足驚人。吾人早疑其不類，及後始知爲兩年前所訂之契的，乃不先不後，忽於此市面動盪之時宣露於外，此一週中，上海市塲法幣所受之創痛至深，要之，皆此一電爲之厲階也。夫非計劃的行動乎？藉日不然，然英國於表示維持法幣之後，固別無行動，無行動何以示眞誠，無眞誠何以維信用，宜乎表示如彼而市塲若此矣。我人則以爲英國之於法幣，非無維持之意念，顧體認未極眞切，斯行動未有決心耳。吾人固知英國上下明哲之士與其健全之輿論，固無不視法幣之興廢，爲英國遠東商業存亡之關鍵，故皆力主援助中國法幣，不惜代價，是其所見者遠；蓋明知法幣一朝崩潰，代之而起者，必爲變相之日幣。者彼「華興」，若彼「聯銀」，號召於衆謂可值六辨士；夫可不限制而兌得六辨士之英金，始得視爲具有六辨士之價值，蓋名價與實價不同，羗無故實之談，雖二先令三先令云云可也。然則英國宜不爲六辨士云云而動心也。即使六辨士，然不幸而中國果隸於日元集團，日元集團之聲勢更不可輕侮，以日人統制外匯之周密，斷不容外人再有從容經營之餘地，天津靑島已露其端，尚囿於局部，不敢暢所欲爲；若一朝羽翼已成，不但英人利益不在其考慮之列，即美法德義之利益，又豈值其一顧，惟其如此，英國於法幣，固宜以行動表示維持之眞誠者也。</p>
<p>更自根本言之，各國之保持中國市塲，要在中國抗戰勝利；期望中國抗戰勝利，必先予中國經濟上以援助，此其爲道，要亦不僅僅於維持法幣。如美國爲中國唯一之友邦，方英將屈伏於東京談判也，而廢止美日商的；華北法幣或天津存銀有被破壞之虞也，而收買中國六百萬盎斯之白銀；此雖由於美國之獨立特行，不全基因於上述之事態，要亦如銅山洛鐘之相應，予中國抗戰精神上實質上以極大助力者也。英本華友，見義勇爲，豈肯後人，徒以當局審慎遲疑，迂迴却顧，幾將全英人士對華眞摯之友誼，爲之抹煞。意者，英國一切實事求是，若最近羅傑士來滬，動機即在實力援助法幣歟！</p>
<p>以吾人所知，中國法幣基礎尚屬不惡；徒以防止日方之儘量套取外匯，始對此貨幣戰爭之前綫，放任黑市之榮枯，是亦不得已而然也；顧乃因此而有影響法幣信用之觀，且仍無以杜塞套取外滙之弊。夫套取之不絕，加以海關失所控制，入超以上海爲獨多，則終必影響法幣，乃屬當然之理。於是厚望於英國切實之維持者，在乎中國獲有後盾之後，得以充分之力量，管理外滙；有效之管理，在乎事權集中；主要之事權，在乎對於國民生活所必需之外匯，能視一定之標準而分配供給。以言合法合理之分配供給，非先有充分力量不爲功；是則惟望英國以切實行動，爲國際率光倡導；庶幾中英商業先受其惠，更可信中國與他國之貿易，亦得緣是採行物物交換方法焉，取得商業信用貸款焉，以爲之輔。如是則黑滙自生自滅，可置不顧；投機之風，可以稍戢；日人亦將無自而以法幣奪取外滙。中國在國際，以對英之經濟關係爲最大最密，是以今日之期待，亦以對英爲最殷最切。</p>

<h3 id="c39">南華遠征的失敗　與李惠堂飛爪哇　香島足球界一段秘聞 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>（香港五日通訊）南華體育會的遠征足球隊、到今日爲止、已在海外作了二十二塲比賽、十五勝、五和、兩敗、這一個成績說它好、也算不錯、說它平常、也有道理、因爲南華會的昔年風頭常是百戰白勝、允其是在南洋一帶遠征、向來不大吃敗仗的、這决征戰才半途、已有兩决敗績、（都有必敗之道）五决和局、不能算是滿意的、在遠征隊一敗於南圻甲隊、又敗於星洲聯隊、</p>
<p>球員人選　發生問題</p>
<p>南華領隊莫慶在啟行前的挑選人員、的確苦衷頗多、南華隊在本港足球季未結束前、就高唱遠征之議、可是一延再延、一直到五月底才動身、那理由有二、（一）是球員人選、無從挑選、（二）是爪哇條件在磋商中、也許有人要奇怪、南華有兩個甲組隊伍、加以乙丙組健將頗多、何以人選會感困難、</p>
<p>可是有一天、莫慶對某記者談、「南華AB兩隊中、水準及於甲組球員者僅十三四人而已、張榮才·包家平·李天生·麥紹漢·劉慶才·梁榮照·楊水益·鄧廣森·馮景祥·陳德輝·黎兆榮·這十一人毫無疑問有資格遠征的羅斗文我不十分歡喜、他還缺少球的管束力、劉松生「月未碰球、張金海踢法與南華其他諸將不同、麥紹漢又傷足、眞是一件値得考慮的事、」說來也有相當道理、</p>
<p>後幾天、他用盡心計想出了一個辦法、</p>
<p>企圖恢復　華華盃賽</p>
<p>他是協會的足球部主席、想起星洲中華隊與外港中華隊向來有「華華盃的埠際賽、今年來、明年去、那一九二五年訂立的辦法、可是到現在、星洲來　港兩次、香港僅回拜一次、原因是門票要完全歸主隊收入的、客隊必須自備路費、木港的協會歷年來經濟支絀、此的始終未曾了過、莫慶於是以圓滿華華盃賽的欠債起見、擬與東方光華兩華隊商量、借用許竟成·侯澄滔·侯榕生·卓石金四人、則全隊實力充强、而旅費槪由南華會負擔、在理論方面講來、協會之向願得償、南華會的人選問題亦可解決、</p>
<p>碰了東方　會的釘子</p>
<p>於是、他就邀請東方會足球部新主任徐亨午膳、將計劃一談、結果徐亨的答語也够公道、「這件事無不贊同、但侯澄滔吿假恐成問題、東方會與光華會的球員、不能與南華會遠征隊同時動身、應直赴星洲、方不爲公論所批評、」</p>
<p>莫慶旣碰了這釘子、同時却又遭南華會本會主要人物的攻擊、理由是、「何不提携本會的球員、而向外人去借人馬呢」這一來、莫慶就只得改變方針、向侯榕生。卓石金個別接洽、更叮囑劉松生練習、終於選中了楊根保、李國威隨征、而譚振輝是臨時入伍的、</p>
<p>爪哇方面　兩個條件</p>
<p>講到爪哇條件、那就是李惠堂遲遲動身的原因、爪哇方面所提出來的條件有二、（一）遠征隊第一决比賽在爪哇、（二）遠征隊隊員中須有李惠堂。李天生·馮景祥三人在內、二者缺一不成、如能辦到、先付保證金七千盾</p>
<p>莫慶、因前决到越南（西貢、河內等處）遠征、成績頗佳、而直此决仍不能忘情於西貢、赴爪哇、旅費昂貴、墊款必多、故決計先赴海防·河內·一段一段的跑近爪哇、而李惠堂因瑞典洋行的職務關係、不能作長時期的遠征、遂對莫慶的答詞、乃借辭於「根本第一個條件旣不能答應、我也無此需要」、</p>
<p>現在呢、爪哇華僑方面與此間南華會商量、同時遠征隊也與之磋商、而惠堂頗想一去爪哇看一看僑胞的球藝、可以為明年世運隊的實力計、同時對瑞典洋行方面、因有一筆華僑生意、須在爪哇接洽、所以才決定前去、三星期返港、他之去與莫慶之敦勸、實不甚相關也、</p>

<h3 id="c44">上海黑市外匯緊縮　與貨幣政策無損　內地金融穩定日趨正軌　政府對外購買力仍照常 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>上海市民應停用奢侈品以節外滙</p>
<p>經政府之調整後貨幣政策、益臻健全、全國金融、已入正軌、黑市外匯平準委會聽其自然後、黑匯繼續猛縮、使套購者遭受阻碍、奢侈品等輸入困難、與中國戰時金融、有益無損、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>貨幣政策　益臻健全</p>
<p>中國之貨幣政策、爲世界貨幣政策中最健全之一、收集金銀、準備充足、禁止輸入、鼓勵輸出、凡此皆所以謀國際收支之平衡、復以統制外匯諸法、防止日人之襲擊、調整金融市塲、謀籌碼之靈活、設國內匯兌管委會、作地方金融流通之調節、故從戰時金融之本質觀之、政府之措施、已計周謀密、然猶不免於法幣價値暗市之跌落者、此則淪陷區域、政府權力不及所致、非政府戰時金融政策之過、而允非中國經濟於戰時暴露弱點也、</p>
<p>內地金融　已入正軌</p>
<p>戰時金融之維持、（一）爲戰時財政之用費、（二）爲普通金融市塲之調整、（三）爲對外購買力之維持、中國政府始終未乞靈於紙幣政策、而戰時通貨、固未膨脹、各地物價之增高、由於求過於供、而不由於通貨之增加、內地金融市塲、以政府銀行與地方金融當局合作之得法、亦均走入正軌、並於對外購買力、因政府統制輸出之物品交換、與友邦之貸款、再加以固有外匯頭寸、戰爭至今已兩載、而中國政府對外之購買力、仍然自若、</p>
<p>黑滙低落　無損大局</p>
<p>非淪陷區域之海關、對外貿易、均為出超、而入超最巨者、則爲淪陷區域各關、足徵政府於統制外匯下之鼓勵輸出一策、已大見功効、上海外匯之黑市、全爲奸人作祟、然此固無損於中國戰時金融、反有益於中國經濟、（一）因黑市外匯跌落、阻止非必需品之輸入、而國貨生產、可以乘機發展、（二）因外匯黑市猛落、使套取外匯之陰謀、受一阻碍、結果足以穩定淪陷區域之法幣地位、其所有之影響爲外貨原料飛漲、使一部份都市人民生活不舒適耳、</p>
<p>淪陷區域　通貨緊縮</p>
<p>淪陷區域之上海市塲通貨籌碼、力謀收縮、藉以减少民衆之購買力、使物價得以低壓、同時因市塲籌碼收縮之故、使持有外匯頭寸者、爲法幣需要之故、勢將拋出外匯、換取一部份法幣、如是外匯與物價、均有調整之功効、由是在今日環境特殊之上海市塲、如增加市塲籌碼、其結果足以鼓勵投機、導資本於不正當投資之途、社會民生、兩受其害、同時並望上海市民自動不用奢侈品、使其自動中止輸入、以節省外匯之消耗、</p>
<p>非必需品　蒙受影響</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉滙基金管理委員會英方代表羅傑士、雖已由滬返港、但此决來滬確與中國幣制及黑市外滙有關、上海黑市外滙、雖爲淪陷區域之特殊情形、價格雖低落、與中國有益無損、但經營非必需品及奢侈品之商人、則營業大受影響、所以最近是項貨物、並無訂的成交者、而已訂購而未裝運者、亦紛紛洽商取消訂購契的、惟必需品仍得輸入、但因滙價關係、成本提高、</p>
<p>外滙再縮　洋貨飛漲</p>
<p>英商滙豐銀行、昨晨外滙掛牌又縮、英滙三辨士二五、美滙六元三一二五、造成空前之最低價格、又據市塲方面消息、滙豐銀行之掛牌一再低落、或與平準委會之英代表羅傑士來滬商洽有關、並據一般之觀察、或有續縮之趨勢、至於天津之外滙黑市、竟隨上海而低落、聞英滙已破三辨士大關、叉因黑市外滙緊縮、必需品價格飛漲、例如亞細亞及美孚之汽油、昨日起又漲價、由邦浦出貨、每加倫二元二</p>
<p>黃金上騰　證劵回漲</p>
<p>黃金暗市集會處、昨晨開做後、因外滙黑市暴縮、以致價格飛漲、漫無止境、上午收盤爲四千六百十五元、下午收盤為四千六百七十元、銀樓業掛牌、大同行上午爲四百四十元、下午爲四百七十元、惟滙劃貼水、仍站在二百元至二百十元之間、證券暗市、昨已回漲、統一甲種四十九元、漲六角、乙種四十二元四角、漲九角、丙種四十元二角半、漲七角、丁種三十八元八角、漲二角半、戊種三十九元七角、漲七角、</p>

<p>法院戒備　益臻嚴密</p>
<p>二日以來、租界各處戒備嚴厲、致犯罪案件、較前特別減少、自今日起、此種警戒狀態、益予加嚴、警務處甲乙丙丁四區華籍區長劉榮貸·吳根源·姚家琳·金士英·均親自前往各該管轄區域之內巡查、各捕房之中西巡捕頭、亦一律乘坐機器脚踏車等、在各馬路巡視、而租界內之北浙江路第一特區地方法院之門禁、益予嚴厲、經守法院內外之警備力、亦隨之加增、而特一法院威海衛路智仁勇女校內附設之臨時辦公處、及同路成都路口之高等法院第二分院、除由各該捕房派捕警戒外、而管轄該區之美方軍、亦在該兩院之內各派長官）員、率領軍十數名荷槍實彈、協助防範、情勢之嚴重、於此可見一斑、</p>
<p>各報門首　裝設沙壘</p>
<p>警務當局為切實保護各外商報館安全計、特於十日起、分別在字林西報·大陸報·泰晤士報·長耕里中美日報·及漢口路申報·新聞報之鄰近、均設有沙袋堆成之堡壘一座、撥派萬國商團駐崗其間、藉以防止再度發生不幸事件、</p>

<p>兩租界當局在各路分佈探捕、嚴密搜查車輛行人外，又以旅館·茶樓、每爲奸徒匿跡之所、故連日飭派探捕、至各茶館旅館等公共塲所、進行搜查盤問、極爲嚴厲、遇有形跡可疑者一律帶回捕房、昨日下午五時、公共租界中央捕房、又派探捕至五馬路平望街口錦春茶樓搜查、五時一刻、始行完畢、結果有三人因行跡可疑而被捕、迨探等將上車時、又有一衣衫襤魯者亦被捕去、</p>

<p>上海電話公司、昨發表電話用戶須知、至有價値、茲分刊如决</p>
<p>搖動電綫　為害甚鉅</p>
<p>有一部份電話用戶、在使用電話之時、時常拉動電綫、指手劃脚時又隨而搖動、及將電話聽筒放置原處之時、又不將電綫拉直、若屢决如此、則即易與裝接於檯機上之電綫互絞、若在牆壁電話、則此電綫即有數處灣曲、更有若干人每以電綫與棹子或其他物件相擊、使其發出聲響、而中國用戶之一手持聽筒、在空中計算筆劃、因而搖動電綫者、爲數更多、諸如此類之搖動、旋轉、均足使電錢中之隔離層轉鬆、而有時損及中部之電綫、使電話與總綫之關係失常、甚且至於完全絕斷、有若干辦公室中、以鋼筆上之墨水、揩拭於此項電綫上、其實墨水浸入以後、每致電綫損壞不可收拾而有更換必要者、</p>
<p>表軌電筒　均須注意</p>
<p>此外在撥動表軌之時、不用手指而代以尖銳之鉛、於是表軌上之字樣、成爲校糊或脫落、以致非更換不可、有若干人當接得電話之時、因需要之人不在、於是即以聽筒重放於桌上或猛力掛於牆上此猶以拳擊人之耳部、聽簡中精巧之機械、即因此而受損、而足以减退具服務之效力、據上海電話公司修理部同人多年經騐所得、往往有人以鉛筆尖或火柴之類塞於電話聽簡上之小孔中、初時其動機不過爲消磨時間、然而結果往往使電話受損、因電話之製造、靴然相當堅固、但終究至爲精巧、</p>
<p>待表軌聲　最為適當</p>
<p>當君提起不聞表軌聲、因此撥動電話上之聽筒架、以爲可使時間减短、但所得之效果則適相反、因君所得者爲無必要之刺激及時間之耗費而已、因自動電話之機械、決不受能聽、視或其他情感作用之影響、反不如稍事忍耐、等待數秒鐘、以聞表軌聲之爲速也、</p>

<h3 id="c77">表現上海 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 康民</p>
<p>所謂「表現上海」，就是說我們從作品中把上海表現出來</p>
<p>有人或者會說：上海已成爲「孤島」，表現她做什麼呢？前方熱血將士，正在衝鋒陷陣，這才該把他們表現出來呢。眞的，在上海，魑魅魍魎，行屍走肉，無恥充塞着空氣，留下來的，也只是一些無知人民的悲聲歎息，難道就表現出這些來麼</p>
<p>這是不對的。第一，上海當然不止上述的一些可恥的可悲的現象，雖然一面是荒淫無恥，但是一面莊嚴的工作，也不可吾認地存在在這「孤島」的上海的。第二，如果我們站在一個正確的觀點上，就是說，不違民族利益的立塲上，來採取題材，分析題材，從而寫成作品，我想，無論是無恥的也好，壯烈的也好，或者是人民的悲聲歎息的也好，都不會妨害作品的眞實價値。我們耍寫抗戰的光明面，但是我們也要暴露出抗戰的黑暗面，不過我們的暴露不是純粹的拍照，吾則，會變成爲失敗主義或民族叛徒的文藝了；我們的暴露，必然是消極中的積極，就是說：我們的暴露文學是糾正了某一些不良的現象；同時也敎育了大衆，從作品中見到自己的悲聲歎息，是如何的可恥，從而知道了只有堅强起來，拚命下去，才能消除目己生活上的苦痛。</p>
<p>但是這樣的作品，在上海有限的報紙副刊或是文藝雜誌上，我們有讀到過麼？有是有的，不過和描寫戰爭或是內地流浪生活的作品的數量比較起來，是少到可憐極了。</p>
<p>有過「上海一日」的集體創作，這是唯一的一本表現上海的値得稱爲偉大的集子了，不過這裏面所寫的還是抗戰開始一年裏面的事實。現在的上海，已不同於抗戰以後的一年了。現在的上海，比抗戰以後的一年更爲可怕了。</p>
<p>文藝的「武器性」，在現在怕沒有人再反對了吧！那末，表現現在的上海，比表現抗戰後一年的上海，在文藝工作的任務上，更加百千倍的重要了。所謂無知的人民的歎息，我們能够隨時隨地聽到了，配合着無恥的論調，這所謂無知的人民的悲聲歎息，實在是可重視的呀！</p>
<p>我們的文藝要發揮出牠的「武器性」來，把千百種罪惡歸結到一個標的上去！但這却並不是拖一條尾巴就够了！我們必須深入現象的核心，正確地把握着牠，而把牠表現出來。</p>
<p>我們希望最近能够在報紙副刋上，或是文藝雜誌，或是一般性的刊物的文藝部鬥上，看出我們的上海的面貌來！</p>
<h3 id="c78">山城的素描 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記—</p>
<p>四百里長征，總算結束了·在明月皎潔的夜晚，渡過寬廣的沙溪，便到了立煌城下。這里，是大別山脈的心臟區域，是過去的赤色地帶，是陳紹禹的老家，也就是眼前的火藥庫；每一個山頭，都潛藏着無限的力量，似乎在說，來吧，殘忍的魔鬼，這兒正是你們的墳墓啊！</p>
<p>跟長蛇似的城牆，雉堞在嚙着飄浮的白雲，月亮從山頂上探出頭來，碉堡，村莊，樹林，以及其它一切，都　穆地溶解在月光之中「多麼美麗的山城！」你準會這樣頌讚的。但這座現代史上有名的城子，雖然經過了快近十年的歲月，還沒有脫離古老的形態；窄狹的街道，低矮的房屋，破舊的廟宇，都足以把社會的貧苦反映出來。即如老百姓的生活狀况，眞簡單得出於意想之外，包穀，山芋，南瓜，　豆，就是他們主要的食糧，除非款待上賓，魚肉是沒人過問的。衣服當然越加簡陋，不單絲織品從來未曾光臨到這裏，甚至洋布也是絕無僅有的；像這樣先天不足的貧苦社會，已經夠使我們驚歎了，然而在抗戰發動以前，還免不了政治的剝削，例如一元一斤的食廳，就是駭人聞聽的負擔。</p>
<p>現在，抗戰使山城的生命復活了，老百姓重新透過一口氣來，李宗仁將軍把治理廣西的方法來支持這大別山脈的根據地，首先免除了不合理的苛捐雜稅，並且解決了嚴重的食鹽俱給問題。他在麻埠辦了一個茶葉貸款處，以無條件的放款貸給茶農，同時動員了全體的鄉村工作團，出發到四鄉去，實地調查農業的生產狀况與技術，以謀穩定這山城的經濟基礎，使『面有菜色』的老百姓，變成精壯的隊伍，一齊起來參加這保衛皖西的神聖工作。</p>
<p>『事在人為』·建設廳長蔡公望常是這麼說。果然，山城的困難已經漸决克服了，當我們在翌晨通過民族街而出東門的時候，鋪子裏的掌櫃都露出了笑臉，在招呼着購賣物品的顧客。這倒不是戰爭所造成的景氣，因爲圍繞於店　裏面的，都是這地十足的老百姓啊。</p>
<p>總之，山城的需要的一切，都充分地準備了！</p>
<h3 id="c79">疑問 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 文庫</p>
<p>我多思索，可是疑問不斷地在心胸間蕩漾。宇宙間的事物，多半和我陌生，我却以爲牠們都是美麗的，輝煌的。我喜歡和牠們接近，相識，熟悉，誰知疑問又在作梗了。</p>
<p>使我了解的事物，似乎微渺得要以「滄海一粟」來形容。我是個人，我却沒有力量知道人生的究竟。</p>
<p>我每天聽到了上帝的忠徒的祈禱，一個個問號都在我腦海中跳躍。有人吿訴我，這也是一種人生，但我却茫然，人生是可以祈禱的嗎？</p>
<p>我也會問過，爲什麼我怕談起已死的人。但得到的答復是。。這是爲了生。一團幻呵，我仍不了解。</p>
<p>沒有答復的疑問纏繞着我，雖在不斷地探求，終沒有止盡的時候，有的竟是虛幻的，</p>
<p>苦悶渺茫的，使我惱悶。</p>
<p>在人生中，疑問如源源的流水，沒有停息。</p>
<p>這無數的啞謎，我沒有方法一一解答，（永遠解答不了的，這些極複雜的問題。）我想以自己發現的一二句眞理的零件，來啟示我的疑問吧！</p>
<p>或者這些躱藏在烟幕中的，能淋漓地顯露哩…</p>
<p>我：在人生途中，不必去注視那些瑣屑的事，祇要認淸進取的鵠的，向一切的障礙搏鬥，允其是悲哀，彷徨，退讓……</p>
<p>我現在又撫心自問，「像這樣，對於人生，還有疑問不？」</p>
<h3 id="c80">苦悶 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>

<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>畢業</p>
<p>從敎室搬到了飯店，我們三十八個。桌子上放着一盆盆淡黃的枇杷。人們懷着各自釣秘密，悲哀與欣喜。誰禁得住那陣子的心跳呢？</p>
<p>漸漸地變了。</p>
<p>嘻笑聲，在呼聲，敬酒聲，碰盃聲鼎沸了，像是要把屋頂吹上天去。笑罷，醉罷，盡情地在歡罷。在剎那間人們要忘却了一切，自己和時代。</p>
<p>不知是懷着歡喜還是憂悒，所能肯定的祇是帶着酒意，人們各自的回去了。</p>
<p>深夜的凉風也許會吹醒每個人的腦吧？可曾想到呢：畢業了那裏去？</p>

<p>— 邊塵</p>
<p>我在一次旅行裹，認識了一個日本慧兵，他要求我交換點東西，說是作爲紀念，於是我被逼着替他描了一個速寫。這使他很希罕，也報答了我一樣東西。就是這「俳句」。</p>
<p>「這是戰死的知友的遺作，作者是漂亮的人物，有才能的靑年，在一九三七年秋，被送來大陸第一綫，會參加了歷决大小戰役。這徘句是受傷後在療養中寄我的。當中的第一首寫於徐州會戰，第二首寫於山西某高地，第三首想是在什麼野戰病院寫的。</p>
<p>「總之，他是一個好人，一偭憂愁的孩子，其實當他第一步踏上大陸時，好像已預感到生還無望了……」</p>
<p>這憲兵用着追憶的感傷調子加以說明，我現在把它譯出來，祗望諸位在這徘句中也能聞到一點憂鬱的氣味，這氣味正像從「大和」帝國黯淡的本體發出來，而通過了比較坦白的詩人的感情的產物。</p>
<p>一　戰地行</p>
<p>野砲的雷鳴，</p>
<p>震碎了我人頭上不祥的黑雲。</p>
<p>夜，帶着冥暗的死滅的翼兒，</p>
<p>覆着幽靈似的行列。</p>
<p>我人沒有了理性，也沒有什麼感覺，</p>
<p>祗向着無底的黑暗爬去。</p>
<p>問一聲</p>
<p>我是找尋什麼！</p>
<p>二　山西「討伐」</p>
<p>我們在我尋敵人，</p>
<p>因爲我們祈望一决戰鬥，</p>
<p>在戰鬥，這生命的賭博中，</p>
<p>我可以擺脫記憶的擔負。</p>
<p>翻過了山，越過了深的谷，</p>
<p>沒有雲片，沒有樹陰，</p>
<p>也沒有敵人的影子。</p>
<p>他們是在什麼神秘的隙眼裏</p>
<p>笑着，偷窺着，——</p>
<p>吉珂德型武士的我人麼？</p>
<p>在寂寞的山嶴裏，</p>
<p>我又擔負了不幸的寂寞和記憶！</p>
<p>三　貓頭鷹</p>
<p>當我最不幸的時候，</p>
<p>也是這種月色昏暗的黃昏，</p>
<p>它總像披黑袈裟的給死者禱吿的牧師，</p>
<p>飛到我家的樹上。</p>
<p>貓頭鷹，我的愛人，</p>
<p>你渡過了黃海，飛越了戰陣，</p>
<p>像一雙鬼火，</p>
<p>你的陰森的眼睛</p>
<p>又燭照了這野戰病院的窗櫺。</p>
<p>貓頭鷹，幸災樂禍的朋友，</p>
<p>你在對我吹奏點啥？</p>
<p>是禱吿呢，是輓歌？</p>
<p>可是我還沒有死呀。</p>

<p>素來富於生意眼的美國影片商們，據傳近來忽然行一種「停止新片輸往中國」的衝動。中國一向是他們的好主顧，何以他們竟有如此企圖呢？據說就因爲外匯緊縮，法幣價低，在上海等地放映新片，收入不够開銷，不得不停止新出鉅片運往遠東。首創此議的，是好萊塢五大影片公司之一的二十世紀福斯公司遠東代理人台魯巴德，他上月底曾向美國各電影鉅子陳述理由，大概說中國法幣對外價値低落後，上海等地營業不振，加以海關稅制變更，人口稅加增，美國影片商實在無利可圖，不如大家中止將新片運往該處爲妙。各鉅子對此建議贊吾不一，大部以爲中國法幣價格低落是暫時現象，福斯的出品比別家成本或者貴些，環境亦有不同。可慮者歐洲各國及遠東如印度等已在自動排斥美片，如再放棄中國市場，無異自殺。但上海一般專映外片的影院，對此舉動却不無震恐之感。幸而夏季有的影院歇夏，有的把舊拷貝或二等片應市，故無鉅片出映，秋凉或有妥當辦法。關心影事的就以爲假使好萊塢眞的停止供給新片，上海一羣摩登影迷不知耍怎樣憂憤失望。但有的斷定不映外片，戲院未必就關門大吉，相反的那時國產片倒可揚眉吐氣，洋貨入口猛跌是一樣的道理。</p>

<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>踏進電影界</p>
<p>電影生活我雖早就有此企想，自已因爲年紀還輕，起先並沒怎樣積極的雄心。四年前，在民眾教育館服務，事先經人介紹相識的導演家蘇怡先生，驀地從香港到省相邀，要我去給全球公司主演一部「新靑年」影片；當時，自己毫沒自信力，覺得很躊躇，很害怕，還不敢貿然答應；後經蘇先生再三敦促，才向館方吿假一月，赴港一試，這情形就是我踏進電影界的起端。</p>
<p>簽訂合同</p>
<p>說來甚覺可笑：那時跑上攝影塲去，還是第一决見到的情景，自己看得很奇怪，什麼都不懂，正好似鄕下人上城一般。但於拍戲工作的嘗試，在異常興奮的情緖下却膽子很大，毫不畏怯。「新靑年」拍演完畢，正想回去銷假供職，又有一家大觀公司，定要和我簽訂幾部戲的長的；自己經此初嘗風味，已具相當把握而又正極感興趣；因即回省辭去本職，開始專力電影工作。三年來拍過的片子如「天下爲公」「翠亨村」等算來共有三十多部；就演技說，我是無善可言；只有一點：從沒演過太沒意義的片子，是覺得頗可自慰的事。</p>
<p>愛好的皮黃戲</p>
<p>在拍戲工作之外，勤讀英文，與學習唱歌，舞蹈，鋼琴是我日常的功課。對於皮黃戲，以前亦曾有着較深切的愛好；那時候廣州有一個「素社」，是士紳們集合研究諸般學術的大規模的組織，我在社中游藝部習練平劇甚久，如「起解」「探母」「家坡」「投軍別窖」諸劇，都曾上臺胡亂演過。到上海來演國語片幸客差足應付，亦即全在練習平劇時，聽他們常說國語，潛心揣摩而學會一些的。</p>

<h3 id="c86">星六星紀之七韓露梅 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>人家說韓露梅是石獅子，我不相信，後來我明白了，我相信了，我對人家說韓露梅是石獅子，人家也不相信，不相信的理由，同我沒有明白之前一樣，因爲露梅的身材，可算得削肩細腰，亭亭玉立，再講她的口材，又算得談笑風生，娓娘不倦，正和石獅子的條件相反，難怪人家不相信了。原來人家所比擬韓露梅的石獅子，不是普通的石獅子，乃是紅樓夢寗國府裏的石獅子，有人說，「寗國府裏，恐怕祇有一對石獅子是乾凈的，我這才明白了。但是還不相信後來同露梅談過幾决話，又聽露梅的同伴姊妹談過關於她的幾次話，我這才有些相信了」。</p>
<p>露梅說，「她今年十九歲，曾在高中肄業，的確，她的中英文字都寫得不錯，說幾句英語，也還要得」。平常舞女，大都把舞客分作三等，一等是戶頭，她們要特別奉承的，可是化費也就特別大了。一等是客人，她們對客人的態度，通常是來者不拒，去者不逍，客人隨隨便便買幾張舞票，舞女隨隨便便作舞幾塲音樂，還有一等是拖車，說來話長，請參閱我那「龍頭與拖車」罷。寫到這裏，我倒忽然想起一椿故事來了：「從前有一位敎館先生，看見東家園地裏種滿了茄子，但始終沒燒出來給他吃，他就學着古人彈鋏的故事，做了兩句諷示的詩道——滿園茄子色斑爛，不與先生供一餐——東家看見了，因爲茄子本不是什麼希罕之物，旣是先生要吃，就令廚房供辦，從此早也茄子，午也茄子，晚也茄子把那先生吃得厭膩不堪，想了又是自己要出來的，不便出爾反爾，祇得再來兩句詩道——不料一茄茄到底，請茄容易送茄難——平常的客人，大槪都想着要嘗嘗做拖車的滋味，可是你們記着，別忘了我這節「請茄容易送茄難」的故事纔好。露梅說：「她是沒有拖車的，而且對於戶頭與客人，也是一視同仁，並不有所軒輊，不過單跳是單跳，坐檯是坐檯，買票出去是買票出去，你多化了錢，她也決不讓你化寃了的。」</p>
<p>露梅的生意，夠得上說個好字，據她自己說，這是全靠她的會說會話，有噱頭，我看到未必盡然，第一是現時的舞女，大概有拖車的多，有時拖車在那裏，就難免沒有心思敷衍客人，第二，露梅究竟在高中讀過書，智識畢竟比一斑略識之無的人高一點，客人邀她坐着談談天，畢竟有趣些。再加她舞旣跳得好，容貌又長得很秀氣，人家自然樂於相就了。</p>

<p>上海更新舞台之邀角大梅花館主鄭子褒及杜麗雲之父杜菊初，由滬出發，携帶十三封信來平邀角，已於日前抵平，分頭進行，已的妥者，有坤伶趙嘯瀾，吳素秋前往揭幕，第一期爲荀慧生演唱，最近歸平之李萬春，亦在約訂中</p>
<p>老伶工閻嵐秋（九陣風）患病多日，時輕時重，迄未痊愈，日來病勢復轉劇，危險萬分，其家屬已爲其預備後事矣。其姪閻世善近自滬上載譽返平，稍事休息，即搭入各班，聞世善已與琴師張九之女訂婚，有於下月內結婚說。</p>
<p>名武生李萬春以排演新戲號召觀衆，頗收成效，最近將繼十八羅漢收大鵬之後，再排一佛化名劇，茲聞劇各已定「佛心皇帝」，係演梁武帝故事，亦由羅漢弟子等，排陳出新，較之十八羅漢收大鵬允爲絢麗，一且開演，定能呌座也。</p>
<p>前此平地曾一度盛傳，名紅凈林樹森決計北上，茲聞忽又打消原議，因林與李洪春，李萬春等皆有相當關係，不願演成鼎足形勢，故北上之計劃，已完全中止。</p>
<p>上海黃金戲院約武生孫毓堃，確有其事，惟與宋德珠分別進行，是否同往上海，同班演唱，現尙未定。同時北平有力方面，亦向黃金邀角人薦舉孫毓堃，或有成功希望。</p>

<p>長腿將軍堂會懸匾與劈忙</p>
<p>至於他在張壽中鬧的花樣，使長腿上了他的大當，幾乎把他氣死，沒奈何祇把他送的壽匾拿大刀亂劈一氣，嘴裹胡罵一陣，藉此算是聊以洩憤，這又可以見到陳氏的不顧信義，似乎於友道方面，有所虧損。陳氏於張母誕日之前，曾派專人送上很貴重的壽禮一份，同時還作了一塊極大的金字壽原，等到初八這天又親自來徐拜壽，自與蘇魯豫三省督辦僅派代表蒞徐者要顯着格外親熱了。長腿見他如是鄭重其事，當然倍極欣感，並且吩咐侍從人等特將陳氏的匾額高懸在壽堂中央，雪軒還力加制止，說我們弟兄都是自家人，決不敢這樣放肆的。論起來張陳倒的確很有舊交，民二冷禦秋以第三師師長駐徐時，張任光復軍團長，陳任七十四混成旅旅長，全歸冷氏指揮，彼此都是老同事，所以雪軒說出這話也並非完全無根，但是張效坤本是一位重義氣的血性朋友，他以爲陳氏旣能以督辦的顯要身分辱臨一個軍長的駐防區域，這當然是很瞧得起自己的，俗謂「你敬我一尺。我敬你一丈，」故而結果仍是陳匾懸掛中央，兩人叙談起來，眞是非常投機，越說越要好，當日就結爲金蘭之交，看戲吃飯的時候，他倆總是坐在一起，別提多麼親熱了。—（八〇）</p>

<p>Xingji: The fighting in southeastern Shanxi has gradually subsided, seemingly drawing to a close. The movements of the Japanese forces thereafter are worthy of attention. The Japanese troops occupying various locations in southeastern Shanxi have been continuously harassed by Chinese forces from multiple directions, showing signs of wavering. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Chongqing telegram reports that a high-level military conference was recently held here. Bai Chongxi, present at the conference, highly praised the commanding authorities in Shanxi Province for their successful tactics in repeatedly defeating the enemy. Consequently, the highest authorities decided to strengthen cooperation between the military and civilians in the war zone. Male and female political workers who have undergone rigorous training in Chongqing have been dispatched to various war zones in teams. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese attempts to disturb Zhongshan's Dieshi were unsuccessful, and they also shelled Muzhou in the 16th district of Xinhui. Chinese troops fought bravely in resistance, and the Japanese soldiers were unable to land. Currently, the Chinese army has increased defenses and is holding firm. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Chongqing telegram reports that the Japanese army in northern Hubei began to retreat on the 8th, along a front of 100 miles from Anjuzhen to Gaocheng. The Japanese initially attempted to breach the Chinese positions in the Tongbai Mountains, but not only did they fail, they were severely defeated by the Chinese forces. As a result, they shifted their attack to the foothills of the southern Henan mountains, forcibly occupying Gaocheng and Lishan southwest of Xinyang. Subsequently, they advanced towards Zaoyang, but after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese army from three directions (northwest, south), the Japanese were forced to abandon Gaocheng and Lishan, fleeing towards Suixian County. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: On the morning of the 9th, six Japanese shallow-water warships and seven motorboats, passing through the West River from Jiangmen, heavily shelled the coast of Zhongshan in an attempt to cover a Japanese landing, but were repelled by the Chinese defenders and fled to anchor off the coast of Muzhou, Xinhui. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: On the morning of the 9th, one detachment of the Japanese army consisting of two companies and a small artillery unit, under the cover of six Japanese aircraft, invaded Fengxi, Chaoan. The Chinese defenders fought bravely in resistance, and after fierce fighting until dusk, the Japanese were unable to sustain the attack. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue the retreating Japanese troops along their original route. In this battle, over eighty Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless military supplies were seized. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Following a major blow to the Japanese forces in western Shandong, the Chinese army annihilated the entire Yamaguchi-Nagata force on the 2nd. In a rage, the Japanese army dispatched over ninety armored vehicles and over three thousand infantry and artillery soldiers from Jianping and Wenshang on the 4th, under the cover of seven or eight aircraft, advancing to the vicinity of Liangshan (west of Dongping) on the 5th, attempting to retaliate against the invading Chinese forces. They made contact with the Chinese army's front lines. Due to the vast disparity in numbers, the Chinese army shifted to an area nearby. In the afternoon, the Japanese army occupied Shouzhangji in seven directions (west of Liangshan) and is continuing to advance. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) In the southeastern Shanxi battle, the Japanese army launched a nine-pronged offensive on July 6th. After being fiercely attacked by Chinese forces from multiple directions and suffering severe blows, the situation became temporarily quiet. Subsequently, the Japanese concentrated their forces to wildly advance into eastern Shanxi, attempting to sweep away the base areas of the brave soldiers of the Taihang Mountains along the Dongyangguan line. However, the Chinese anticipated their scheme and preemptively struck. On one hand, they used superior forces to pressure the Japanese army on the Hongtong-Tunliu road to move south, and on the other hand, they thoroughly swept away the Japanese forces in Changzhi and Gaoping on the Baishan road, making it impossible for the Japanese to gain a foothold, controlling them from left and right, and turning all their plans to naught. On the 4th of this month, the Chinese army recaptured Linxian, consolidating the outer perimeter of the Taihang Mountains. On the 2nd, they recovered Liangma and Liangtun, causing even greater panic among the Japanese forces, who saw the large Chinese army north of the Hongtong-Tunliu road as a thorn in their side. Therefore, starting from the 7th of this month, they launched another six-pronged offensive, attempting to "clear out" the Chinese forces in that area. The first route, based in Xindianzhen, Qin County, consisted of over 700 Japanese soldiers and two cannons, attacking the Chinese-held Guxian Bo (south of Qin County), heading west towards Qinyuan. The second and third routes, starting from Hepingzhen (west of Liangmazhen) and Donghongyi, each consisted of over 300 Japanese soldiers, attacking Tangcheng to the north and Qinyuan to the north, respectively. The fourth and fifth routes, starting from Huoxian and Anze, each consisted of two to three hundred Japanese soldiers, converging on Hepingzhen (south of Anze), heading east towards Qinyuan. The sixth route, starting from Wangpingzhen (south of Pingyao), consisted of over 200 Japanese soldiers, attacking south, heading straight for Qinyuan. The Chinese army is now flanking the Japanese forces in a mobile posture, determined to annihilate the Japanese forces one by one before stopping. The Japanese army in Shexian, eastern Shanxi, with over 2,000 soldiers, also launched a westward offensive in multiple routes on the 7th. After being intercepted midway by the Chinese army, they suffered heavy casualties. Subsequently, the Japanese army used poison gas. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese army withdrew from Dongyangguan (southwest of Shexian) on the 7th. The Japanese army, now attacking south in multiple routes near KOUKOUKOU, engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army northwest of Macun on the 8th. A certain Chinese unit west of Qinshui intercepted two routes of Japanese troops attacking east, killing two to three hundred Japanese soldiers in areas such as Donggou and Zhangma Northeast. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed to the west. On the 9th, the Chinese army had already occupied Beiling (south of Longhua) and is now encircling and annihilating the remaining Japanese forces in the Zhangshangge village area. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Chinese forces in northern and central Hubei have launched continuous attacks and are making smooth progress. The remaining Japanese forces that have not withdrawn from the area south of Qingmiaozhen and Gaocheng have been completely cleared by the Chinese army. The Chinese army has approached the outskirts of Suixian County and is currently in a standoff with the Japanese army. (11th Dispatch) The remaining Japanese forces have been completely cleared by the Chinese army. The Chinese army has approached the outskirts of Suixian County and is currently in a standoff with the Japanese army. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi: The Japanese army from Luohansi attempted to cross the Shayang River on the morning of the 7th with over twenty wooden boats under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese army waited until the Japanese army was halfway across before launching a fierce attack, sinking over ten Japanese boats. Over two hundred and forty Japanese soldiers were killed or drowned. The remaining boats hurriedly sailed back. Furthermore, the Japanese army in Yangzi fled north on the 7th, but was ambushed and defeated by Chinese troops, suffering over eighty casualties. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinhua: Two Japanese warships and a transport ship fully loaded with Japanese soldiers arrived at the sea off Shipu town, Xiangshan, on the morning of the 6th. Under the cover of three Japanese aircraft, Japanese marines forcibly landed. The Chinese army met them with a head-on attack, fighting bravely and killing many Japanese soldiers. Unable to sustain the attack, the Japanese soldiers fled back to their ships in disarray and sailed away. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Assault Incident by Thugs: Japan Responds to British Protest, Completely Rejecting British Demands, Refusing to Interfere with Demonstrations <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The British authorities here previously lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General Shigenori Tasiro because Chinese mobs openly attacked British property near Japanese sentries. However, Tasiro firmly rejected the protest last night. According to sources at the British Consulate, the Japanese side, while promising to maintain security and order in the occupied areas and protect the interests of third countries, stated through Tasiro to British Consul Jamieson that the mob riot had nothing to do with the Japanese side. It is said that Tasiro believed that the actions of the mobs, all of whom were Chinese, were merely an expression of their sentiments and could not be the responsibility of the Japanese side. Reportedly, Tasiro also told the British Consul, "You are well aware of our efforts to maintain security and order." It is reported that the British trading firm Taikoo and the Universal Export Company were attacked by mobs on the 4th of this month, resulting in the complete destruction of the doors, windows, and furniture of the businesses, and the throwing of books and documents into the Hai River. Although Japanese sentries were patrolling nearby at the time, they did not intervene. Furthermore, the British had repeatedly decided to protest to the Japanese authorities regarding the disturbance caused by the anti-British movement, but Tasiro had rejected each one. (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The British Consulate's protest to the Japanese Consulate over the attack on the International Export Company by Chinese mobs has received a response today. The response states that the demonstration movement is an automatic expression of the emotions filling the Chinese people, so the Japanese authorities cannot accept British intervention and cannot interfere with such demonstrations, but acts of violence will not be tolerated. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military has tightened its blockade of the British and French concessions here today. Indians, who have never been inspected in the past, are now being routinely searched by the Japanese when passing through the entrances and exits of the concessions. It is noted that the Japanese had not searched Indians before the Indian troops were reinforced in Singapore, so the meaning of the current search of Indians is noteworthy. (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the Japanese semi-official side has repeatedly stated that the anti-British movement is spontaneous on the part of the Chinese, that this anti-British sentiment originated with the Opium War a century ago and has only now found an outlet, the Japanese are still clearly showing their participation in the movement. A recent indication of this is the arrival here of an important figure from the Tokyo Social Masses Party, named Watanabe, who is currently discussing with other Japanese and local officials his plan to organize an international anti-British movement in China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Tonight, two thousand employees of the South Manchuria Railway and the Traffic Corporation (the Japanese agency that has taken over various transportation businesses in North China) will hold an anti-British rally. The reason for the existence of this movement is becoming clearer in a statement issued by the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters. The statement accuses Britain of deliberately delaying the Tokyo talks in order to await the signing of a public agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and states that if the "scheming" Britain does not give a "yes" or "no" answer to Japan's demands, other anti-British plans will be implemented. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At a press conference today, a Japanese military spokesman claimed that he believes that Chinese employees of the HSBC bank will soon abandon their posts. When a foreign reporter asked if the "Anti-British Association" intended to intimidate Chinese employees of the bank, the spokesman said, "I cannot know this, but I believe it may be the case." He maintained that the anti-British movement in North China is a natural occurrence and is not due to Japanese support. Another foreign reporter asked, "Then why have many Chinese hired by the British received various threatening letters?" The spokesman replied, "These people are all ignorant and foolish, so the Anti-British Committee must provide them with appropriate education. Furthermore, these people are ignorant of the world situation, ignorant of the situation in North China, and ignorant that the actions of the British are completely detrimental to China, so they must be made aware of the advantages and disadvantages. However, sending threatening letters seems excessive." (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) According to news from here today, the Asia Petroleum Company in Cuoshan, one hundred miles west of Qingdao, was attacked by anti-British rioters on the 4th of this month, and one thousand two hundred boxes of gasoline, worth twenty-five thousand dollars, were looted. It is also reported that anti-British committees in the interior have issued notices requiring that all British goods be sold off before the 10th of this month, otherwise they will be destroyed. However, local merchants mostly disagree with this. (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a person close to Wu Peifu speaking to an Associated Press reporter, Wu Peifu is determined not to join the so-called "New Central Government" organized by Wang Jingwei. Last night, an Associated Press reporter asked a Japanese military spokesman, who also said that Wu Peifu was unwilling to come out of retirement, and that Wu was old. Regarding Wu Peifu's refusal to meet with Wang Jingwei when Wang visited Beiping, and only briefly spoke with Wang on the phone, the Japanese military spokesman also admitted it without reservation. (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers this morning mostly commented on Wang Jingwei's broadcast speech given in Guangzhou on August 9th, referring to it as the transition from Wang's peace movement from theory to practice. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that Wang was born in Guangzhou, and Guangzhou is the origin of the Chinese revolution, so it is appropriate that Wang chose Guangzhou as the stage for peace propaganda. The Hochi Shimbun said that Wang's words were directed at southwestern China and overseas Chinese, but its principles can be applied to all of China. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the possibility of a truce announced by Wang is his firm belief. The Asahi Shimbun said that Guangzhou, the origin of the revolution, will enjoy the reputation of being the "origin of peace," depending entirely on whether the Guangdong army and the people of Guangdong respond to Wang's peace movement.

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources received here today, the Chinese regular army, supplemented by mobile units, is attempting to cut off the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It is reported that a large number of Chinese troops are concentrated in the Pinghu area near the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and are attacking Jiaxing. At the same time, another route of Chinese troops is attacking the highway between Shanghai and Hangzhou. After a week of fighting, Chinese troops in Pudong have occupied Zhujiaqiao in its eastern part. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The puppet self-defense corps stationed in the area near Zhangzhuang Railway Station launched a fierce attack on the remnants of the seventh and eighth Japanese armies, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers, and carrying away trucks and other military supplies stored by the Japanese army in the area. They surrendered to the Chinese army and are currently attacking the Japanese army in a certain area. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ann Arbor, Michigan: According to Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, in a speech at the Far East Issues Research Association last night, the situation of the Chinese war has never been as good as it is today since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. To this day, Japan is not only on the verge of economic collapse, but also faces the crisis of being drawn into the vortex of a world war. Hu praised the continuous assistance of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries in China's war of resistance, saying that China would not have been able to resist for so long without the continuous assistance of friendly countries. Hu praised the United States' abolition of the trade treaty with Japan, as China feels most pessimistic about Britain's submission to Japan at this time. (11th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e10">Review of Britain's Policy of Maintaining Legal Tender (FaBi) <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>British public opinion generally speaks of maintaining Chinese Legal Tender. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler have also frequently announced their determination to maintain Chinese Legal Tender to members of the House of Commons and Lords. Such sympathy between the government and the public is commendable. Given the economic strength of the British pound, with the determination to maintain Legal Tender, it should be able to sweep away the clouds of gloom. However, what seems to be the actual impact?</p>
<p>For the past month, the Shanghai financial market has been turbulent, the black market exchange rate has frequently shrunk, and the value of gold has risen step by step. Speculators are treating gold and foreign currency as footballs, and Legal Tender as a bet, leading to soaring prices and suffering for ordinary people. This phenomenon cannot be ignored for the sake of Shanghai's finances and the five million residents. However, we believe that the seriousness of the problem does not lie entirely in this. Indeed, while the isolated island has become an international special zone, it is very different from the occupied areas, but it is still different from the mainland. Foreign exchange cannot be controlled, imports and exports cannot be managed, people from all sides are mixed, and personnel are complicated, forming the front line of a currency war. For Legal Tender in Shanghai, it is not only the main force on the Chinese side and the medium of international trade, but also used by the Japanese side as ammunition for attack, and by speculators as a basic chip. Therefore, these profound contradictions are not easy to adjust to perfection. To put it another way: raising the value of the currency will invigorate legitimate industry and commerce, and both Chinese and foreign residents will be delighted, but those who attempt to undermine Legal Tender will also be happy to take advantage of this to exchange more foreign exchange with fewer assets. Lowering the value of the currency will make it difficult for all industries and difficult for general living, but those who attempt to undermine Legal Tender will also have to expend more effort for less gain. Alas, it is a dilemma.</p>
<p>We believe that there is no way to avoid harm while seeking benefit. The method may not be fully effective or perfect, but it must be better than laissez-faire. The greatest harm of laissez-faire is that it shakes the credit of Legal Tender. Maintaining credit cannot be achieved through words alone. For example, Britain has repeatedly expressed its intention to maintain Legal Tender, but it has had no impact on the feelings revealed by the Shanghai black market. Can the reason for this not be deeply considered? Or perhaps some believe that although Britain has expressed its intentions, it is not only paying lip service without actual help, but also acting in a way that is contrary to its intentions. For example, the British side recently disseminated news that China has printed 100 million Legal Tender banknotes, which, at one yuan per note, amounts to 100 million yuan, not to mention that the face value is more than that. This amount is large enough to be alarming. We had suspected that it was untrue, and later learned that it was a contract signed two years ago. However, it was revealed to the outside world at this time of market turbulence. The pain inflicted on Legal Tender in the Shanghai market this week has been profound, and this one telegram is the root cause of it. Was it not a planned action? If not, Britain has taken no other action after expressing its intention to maintain Legal Tender. Without action, how can it show sincerity? Without sincerity, how can it maintain credit? It is appropriate that the market is like this despite such expressions. We believe that Britain does not lack the intention to maintain Legal Tender, but its understanding is not genuine enough, so its actions lack determination. We know that the wise men of Britain and its sound public opinion regard the rise and fall of Legal Tender as the key to the survival of British commerce in the Far East, so they all advocate assisting Chinese Legal Tender, regardless of the cost. Their vision is far-reaching because they clearly know that if Legal Tender collapses one day, it will be replaced by a disguised Japanese currency. Those "China Prosperity" and "Joint Reserve" currencies call upon the public to say that they are worth sixpence. A value of sixpence can only be regarded as having a value of sixpence if it can be exchanged for sixpence in British gold without restriction. The nominal price is different from the actual price, so baseless talk, even about two shillings or three shillings, is acceptable. Therefore, Britain should not be swayed by talk of sixpence. Even if it is sixpence, if China unfortunately falls under the Japanese yen group, the momentum of the Japanese yen group cannot be underestimated. With the meticulous control of foreign exchange by the Japanese, they will not allow foreigners to have any room for leisurely operation. Tianjin and Qingdao have already shown signs of this, but they are still confined to the local area and dare not do as they please. If one day their wings are fully formed, not only will the interests of the British not be considered, but even the interests of the United States, France, Germany, and Italy will not be worth their attention. Therefore, Britain should show its sincerity in maintaining Legal Tender with action.</p>
<p>From a more fundamental point of view, the key to each country maintaining the Chinese market lies in China's victory in the war of resistance. To hope for China's victory in the war of resistance, it is necessary to first provide China with economic assistance. This path is not limited to maintaining Legal Tender. For example, when the United States, China's only ally, was about to submit to the Tokyo talks, it abolished the US-Japan trade treaty. When North China Legal Tender or the silver reserves in Tianjin were at risk of being destroyed, it purchased six million ounces of silver from China. Although this was due to the independent actions of the United States, not entirely based on the above-mentioned situation, it was like the resonance of a bronze mountain and a falling bell, providing great assistance to China's war of resistance both spiritually and materially. Britain is a friend of China, and it should not lag behind in acting with courage. It is only because the authorities are cautious and hesitant, and turn back in a roundabout way, that they almost erase the sincere friendship of the entire British people towards China. Perhaps Britain is realistic in everything. If Rogers's recent visit to Shanghai was motivated by strong support for Legal Tender!</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the foundation of Chinese Legal Tender is not bad. It is only to prevent the Japanese from exchanging as much foreign exchange as possible that the prosperity and decline of the black market is allowed on this front line of the currency war. This is also inevitable. However, this has led to a view that affects the credit of Legal Tender, and still cannot prevent the abuse of exchanging foreign exchange. If the exchange continues unabated, coupled with the loss of control over customs, with Shanghai having the largest import surplus, then it is only natural that Legal Tender will be affected. Therefore, there is a strong hope that Britain will provide effective maintenance, so that after China has a backing, it will be able to manage foreign exchange with sufficient strength. Effective management lies in the centralization of power. The main power lies in the ability to allocate and supply foreign exchange, which is necessary for the people's livelihood, according to a certain standard. To allocate and supply in a legal and reasonable manner, it is not effective without sufficient strength. Therefore, it is hoped that Britain will take concrete actions to lead the way internationally. This will allow Sino-British trade to benefit first, and it is even more credible that China's trade with other countries will also be able to adopt barter trade methods and obtain commercial credit loans as a supplement. In this way, the black market will live and die on its own, and can be ignored. Speculation can be slightly curbed. The Japanese will also have no way to seize foreign exchange with Legal Tender. China's economic relationship with Britain is the largest and closest in the world, so today's expectations are also the most eager and urgent towards Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Statement by Chairman Chiang: Another Address to National Gentry and Educators; Lead Local Compatriots in Practicing the National Covenant and Assist Local Governments in Establishing a Foundation for Autonomy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang recently issued "Another Address to Gentry and Educators Nationwide," stating in brief: On January 19th of this year, I telegraphed prominent gentry and educators across the country, requesting that all appreciate the arduousness of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, rise together, assist the government in promoting conscription, increasing production, replenishing manpower and resources, and achieving ultimate victory. Since the release of that address, reports from various levels of Party and government organs indicate that local figures have mostly been sincerely moved and responded enthusiastically. Regarding assistance with conscription, the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou have all seen local gentry personally send their eldest sons and direct nephews to enlist in the army, forgetting their families for the sake of saving the nation. Their sincerity and enthusiasm, loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness are enough to move heaven and earth and touch the spirits. This is truly the highest expression of national spirit and a source of infinite comfort. This determination to resist the war aligns perfectly with the ancient sage's clear teaching that "adversity builds nations." Compatriots across the country, having been tempered by this experience, have come to recognize the times, awaken to their responsibilities, and experience an outburst of patriotic spirit and a strengthening of their will to fight, surpassing the effect of ten years of education. If prominent figures everywhere can seize this opportunity and provide even better guidance, enabling the people of the whole country to rise together and work together for the revolution, then the progress of the war of resistance will be the growth of national reconstruction. The time of achieving final victory will also be the day of establishing a new nation that realizes the Three Principles of the People. Based on the above, what is expected of gentry and educators in various places, in addition to the items indicated in the previous telegram, is as follows, with continuing sincere expectations: First, it is hoped that you will lead local compatriots in solemnly practicing the National Covenant. The importance of this has been clearly explained previously. What should be especially noted is that the various detailed items listed in the "Implementation Measures," concerning correcting lifestyles, cultivating vigor, eliminating bad habits, breaking down harmful intentions, and correcting divergent and confused thoughts, are all aimed at the roots of the compatriots' ailments. The reason we have been able to grow stronger with each battle over the past two years is due to the unified awakening of the majority of soldiers and civilians across the country, who have mutually encouraged each other to uplift their spirits and save the nation from peril. However, upon closer examination, it is clear that our spiritual transformation still has many shortcomings and must be made even stricter and more rigorous before it can be perfected. If we can fully comply with each point in the Implementation Measures, earnestly put them into practice, examine them everywhere, and encourage them at all times, and if local prominent figures can personally practice them to transform and influence every compatriot, then the lives of all people will be extremely diligent, and there will be no worry about insufficient material resources. Everyone's will will be extremely firm, and there will be no worry about insufficient manpower. Actions and thoughts will be extremely strict and refined, and victory will be achieved in every battle. Secondly, the National Association is the group for promoting this initiative, and the National Covenant, which it stipulates should be recited, is the creed for encouraging compatriots to achieve victory. Its significance is extremely clear. It is hoped that prominent figures everywhere will lead the monthly diligent practice of the Covenant, being sincere and trustworthy, without slackening or relaxation, vigorously promoting it, and mutually supervising each other, setting an example to inspire common respect and trust, and persevering to encourage common perseverance. The ancient sages compared the virtue of a gentleman to the wind blowing over the grass, which is bent by it. Prominent figures everywhere have a responsibility to promote this, and it is their inescapable duty, so there is no need for further elaboration. Second, it is hoped that you will assist local governments in reorganizing local finances and laying the foundation for autonomy. Implementing local autonomy is the central tenet of the Principle of People's Rights. Sun Yat-sen personally drafted the Implementation Law for the Commencement of Local Autonomy, providing extremely detailed instructions. The central government had already formulated laws and regulations in preparation for implementation. However, since the September 18th Incident, we have recognized the urgency of self-defense in the face of foreign aggression, so we changed to implementing the Baojia system, starting with organizing and training the masses, supplemented by the necessary measures of management, education, support, and defense, which laid the initial foundation for local autonomy. Now, the Baojia system has taken shape, and the organization and training of the masses are also well-ordered, making the implementation of autonomy as easy as pushing a boat downstream, which is even more convenient. Therefore, the central government has recently been drafting organizational rules for all levels below the county level and formulating procedures for promoting autonomy, which will be promulgated soon. The self-defense of the masses in the past, due to strict organization and training, has resulted in the initial cultivation of the ability to govern themselves. In the future, autonomy should enable the masses to complete all local construction suitable for modern nations through their own initiative, further strengthening the power of our nation and people. The principles are consistent, and the meanings are mutually complementary. At the beginning of this initial promotion, we rely on prominent figures everywhere to enlighten local compatriots and inspire their spirit of self-awareness and initiative, so that each can fulfill their common duties and responsibilities for the cause of autonomy. Furthermore, it must be known that local autonomy has common necessary undertakings. In addition to the six items originally stipulated by Sun Yat-sen—clearing household registration, establishing institutions, determining land prices, repairing roads, reclaiming wasteland, and establishing schools—today, there are also organizing teams, promoting cooperation, preparing grain reserves, and providing healthcare, all of which are essential plans for providing sufficient food, having a strong army, strengthening the race, and protecting the country, and cannot be neglected. The central government has also made concrete plans to provide funding for these undertakings, and in the future, it intends to allocate a portion of national taxes and change them into local county revenue, specifically for creating autonomous undertakings. However, the situation of tax collection in our country has been deeply plagued by accumulated malpractices. The personnel involved have always excelled at seizing and encroaching upon funds, and the local people, either relying on their power to resist payment or using cunning to evade and leak funds, have also become accustomed to this. As for the local gentry, those who conduct themselves uprightly merely pay their own taxes, while those who do not know how to cherish themselves are even more likely to be in arrears. Most are indifferent to the surpluses and deficits of public revenue, treating them as if they were unrelated. Therefore, although our country has vast land and numerous people, local finances have not yet been brought onto the right track, and local undertakings have never been able to flourish, which is due to the fact that prominent figures everywhere are unwilling to intervene, unwilling to assist local governments, and also unable to guide local people to fulfill their civic duties. Now that autonomy is about to begin, we must use local people to handle local affairs, and this trend of self-imposed isolation must be changed. Prominent figures everywhere should be eager to do good and should not lag behind. They should express their enthusiasm, rise together, support the government, and reorganize taxes. Those involved in embezzlement should be supervised and reported, and those who enrich themselves at the public's expense should be supervised and impeached. Gather the strength of the many upright to restrain the schemes of the few treacherous. The government will be your backing, and there is no need to be afraid. It must be known that eliminating accumulated malpractices and investigating embezzlement is precisely to guarantee that the people can fulfill their legal obligations and also to avoid increasing the people's extra burden. For example, the slaughter tax, stamp tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, land tax, deed tax, and other taxes have been embezzled and evaded in unknown amounts on a daily basis. Recently, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces changed the slaughter tax to be collected by townships and towns, and after collection, the amount collected actually exceeded the previous amount by many times. By analogy, if prominent figures everywhere can stand up for righteousness and assist the government in areas that its eyes and ears cannot reach, then all taxes need not add a single cent to the people's burden, and the amount will definitely increase sharply. The funding for autonomous undertakings can definitely be secured. Furthermore, following the teachings of Sun Yat-sen that "two hands are all-powerful," afforestation, land reclamation, fish farming, animal husbandry, and efforts to create local products, supplemented by harvest years, will lead to the revival of all industries and an inexhaustible supply. All of this can be achieved by human effort and is not just empty talk. Especially in these difficult times, prominent figures everywhere must inspire loyalty, break through personal considerations, recognize that laying the foundation for local autonomy is a duty that must be fulfilled to repay the country and complete the great cause of resistance and reconstruction, and resolutely and sharply rise up and strive for it. This is what we rely on to achieve success. (11th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an editorial today commenting on China's current financial situation, strongly stating that at this time when China is engaged in a long-term struggle with Japan, the people of the whole country should at least do three things: (1) support the government's financial measures, (2) have faith in China's legal tender, and (3) drastically reduce unnecessary consumption of foreign goods. China is an agricultural country, and domestic production can be self-sufficient. This can be seen from the fact that while the prices of all goods have risen sharply, the market price of grain has not been very expensive. Therefore, as long as the people of the whole country have grain, they should not worry about the exchange value of the currency (Haitong Telegram, 11th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Craigie met this morning at the Japanese Vice-Minister's residence with Kato, the chief Japanese representative at the Round Table Conference. It is reported that Craigie sought Kato's understanding regarding the handover of Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case to the "Provisional Government" in Beiping and explained to Kato that the delay in the arrival of instructions from London was entirely due to the careful consultations and deliberations currently underway in London. Kato stated to Craigie that he had no objection to the British announcement of the extradition of the four suspects. Kato then consulted with Foreign Minister Arita and Vice-Minister Sawada and then went to the British Embassy in the morning to meet with Craigie and inform him that representatives of the Japanese military authorities had decided to travel from Tokyo to Tianjin at the beginning of next week. If instructions from London arrive in Tokyo only after the departure of the Japanese military representatives, then the Japanese government will have no choice but to reserve the right to decide whether the meeting should be reopened. Kato urged Craigie to convene a meeting as soon as possible to establish an agreement on economic issues and police affairs (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the British government has decided to hand over the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng assassination case in Tianjin to the local Chinese court for trial. The British government has repeatedly refused to extradite these four people without sufficient evidence of their crimes. Recently, Tokyo secretly telegraphed the British government with other evidence, and after lawyers in London expressed their opinions on this and conducted a very careful study, they finally decided that there was preliminary evidence of crimes committed by two of them, while the other two were proven to be members of illegal groups. According to Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons on August 4, this obligates the British authorities in the concession to hand over the four defendants to the local Chinese court for trial. Another Chinese man named Su Zhenwu (transliteration) has been detained by the British authorities in Tianjin to this day and will also be handed over to the de facto Chinese authorities and held in reasonable protection, so that the British Consul General can visit him from time to time to see if he is being treated fairly. British Ambassador Craigie will, in accordance with the instructions of his government, notify the Japanese government of the decision of the London judicial authorities and will send the same note to the National Government in Chongqing. This matter and the local disputes currently being discussed in Tokyo are two separate matters and are determined entirely on their own merits and are not related to the temporary suspension of the Tokyo talks, nor are they part of any bargaining event. Authorities stated that in order to try these four people, the British government has now sent detailed instructions to Craigie, and the Tokyo talks should be resumed as soon as possible. These instructions focus on police and security matters in the British concession in Tianjin but are related to all the disputes being discussed by both sides (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Embassy issued a statement this morning strongly denying the newspaper reports that Britain was deliberately delaying the Anglo-Japanese Round Table Conference, saying that the reports in Japanese newspapers that the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin case conference was temporarily suspended because the British government deliberately delayed issuing instructions to its resident envoy in Tokyo were completely untrue. The issues currently being studied are extremely complex and important. This can be seen from the fact that after the arrival of the British representative from Tianjin in Tokyo, the Japanese authorities still needed half a month for preliminary consultations and deliberations. London also needs the same consultations, and the consultations are progressing rapidly (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated here today while receiving reporters that the Japanese side had no intention of breaking off the Anglo-Japanese conference, but everything depends on the British side. The British representative said that he had not yet received instructions from his government, while the representatives of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin announced that they would not stay in Tokyo after next week if instructions from London had not arrived. He expressed sympathy for the Japanese military representatives because they all had their own duties to handle in Tianjin. When reporters inquired about the fact that the French and American chargés d'affaires in Japan had negotiated with the Japanese government regarding the Tianjin currency system issue, the spokesman replied that he was not convenient to disclose the details. If the United States and France wish to participate in the Tokyo talks, they can express their opinions on the Arita-Craigie compromise. There is no sign that the United States, France, and Britain have formed a common front. However, the United States and France are indeed paying close attention to some of the specific issues being discussed by Britain and Japan in Tokyo. This can be seen from their negotiations with the Japanese government (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Craigie met with Kato, the chief Japanese representative, at Maru at 9:00 this morning. Ambassador Craigie stated that he had received instructions from his government this morning and was prepared to extradite the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case. He asked the Japanese side to understand that the reason for the delay in the Anglo-Japanese talks was that the British side considered the importance of the issue, so London was particularly cautious in its deliberations, and these deliberations were still proceeding as quickly as possible. In response to this statement by Ambassador Craigie, Minister Kato immediately discussed a reply with Foreign Minister Arita and Director General Sawada. As a result, he went to the British Embassy again at 10:40 AM and met with Ambassador Craigie, stating that the representatives of the Japanese local military authorities had decided to return to Tianjin at the beginning of next week to resume their posts. He had already notified them yesterday. Even if instructions from the British government arrived later, it would be difficult to continue the meeting. Whether to continue the meeting at that time would depend on the Japanese government's own position and judgment. He called the British side's attention to this and also stated that the Japanese side deeply hoped that the British side would not only address the current issues with announcements regarding security issues, etc., but would return to the right path and seek to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible. In short, the Anglo-Japanese talks have now reached a major divergence point, either a comprehensive compromise or a complete breakdown (Domei News Agency Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese representatives attending the Round Table Conference may hold another meeting today. It is reported that they will discuss the issue of police affairs in the British concession in Tianjin, but economic issues may not be discussed. As for the arrangement for the Round Table Conference to continue, there is still none. The "Asahi Shimbun" claims that the Japanese Embassy in Tokyo believes that even if it has not received the British government's final opinion, the embassy can resume economic talks this week based on the information already transmitted from London. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" criticized Britain's delaying tactics, saying that if instructions from London are still not received by the end of this week, the Anglo-Japanese talks will definitely break down (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the British side's insincerity and implementation of delaying tactics, the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo have fallen into a state of indefinite postponement and breakdown. Today, the four representatives of the Japanese local military, Major General Muto, Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka, Major Ota, and Major Miyamoto, are scheduled to take a flight from Haneda Airport at 6:00 AM on the 14th to return to Tianjin to resume their duties. The return of the Japanese military local representatives this time is entirely due to the British side's insincerity towards Japan. The Japanese side expressed its resolute determination (Domei News Agency Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi Meets with British Foreign Secretary; Inquires About the Truth of Negotiations with Japan</p>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday for a forty-five-minute conversation, discussing the issue of Chinese finance and economy and the four Chinese suspects in the British concession in Tianjin. Guo inquired whether Britain intended to agree to Japan's request for extradition. News came out of Britain yesterday that British legal experts were studying the evidence presented by the Japanese side and might announce the charges against these people. Guo and Halifax also discussed the recent 3 million pound credit loan from Britain to China and several other loans that are still under negotiation. It is believed that they must have also talked about the issue of stabilizing China's legal tender. After the meeting, Halifax met with Foreign Secretary Jaddgan, Mensi, and the head of the Far East Department of the Foreign Office, Langnatt, to discuss the situation in the Far East and the instructions to be sent to British Ambassador Craigie in Japan. This new instruction will involve Japanese currency and Japan's request for the silver reserves in North China (Associated Press Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the meeting between Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, a diplomatic correspondent for the London Times recently stated, "Rumors are circulating in financial circles here that the British authorities have actually decided to hand over the Chinese silver stored in the Tianjin concession to the Japanese side. Ambassador Guo's meeting with Foreign Secretary Halifax must be related to this matter. In fact, this rumor is not true. The negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo are currently at a standstill. The latest proposal from the Japanese side is being carefully reviewed by the British authorities one by one. As for the silver reserves, this is considered a thorny issue in international law and should not be used as a bargaining chip. The world supports China's position and has ample reasons to uphold it, because this silver reserve belongs to the Chinese government, and the British side has stated that all decisions will not violate the legitimate demands of all parties involved. Regarding this matter, Sir Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, also discussed this issue with Sir Rogers, the representative of the Bank of England and member of the Chinese Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, in Shanghai a few days ago (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>The US Government Firmly Opposes Changing the Status Quo of China's Currency System</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of the 48 million Chinese currency in silver reserves in Tianjin, people close to the government here say that before the British authorities telegraph new instructions to British Ambassador Craigie in Japan, they will closely monitor the positions adopted by France and the United States, because those countries also have a vital interest in this issue. As far as France is concerned, a large amount of the aforementioned silver reserves is deposited in the French Bank in Tianjin. According to reliable sources, the French government is about to notify the British and Japanese governments that it opposes the transfer of the silver reserves to the Japanese side, but this news has not yet been confirmed. As far as the United States is concerned, the currency exchange issues raised by the silver reserve issue are also related to the US government. Generally, the views of the US government are as follows: Although the United States has no direct relationship to this immediate issue, it expresses sympathy for Britain's resistance to Japan's demands. Furthermore, if the current state of the Chinese currency system is changed, it would involve the general issue of the Open Door Policy, which is opposed by the United States. In addition, as for the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin, government legal advisors are said to be in favor of extradition, but it is not yet known whether the government agrees (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from Tokyo, the governments of the United States, France, and Britain will jointly express their concern to the Japanese government regarding China's economic situation. Deputy Secretary of State Welles did not acknowledge this when receiving reporters today, saying that the United States, France, and Britain have not taken any joint action. The US government has also not recently negotiated with the Japanese government regarding the current exchange control measures or various commercial restrictions in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. As for the Tianjin issue, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement on June 19 that can be reviewed (Hull said that although the Tianjin local incident is not related to the United States, its development and significance, as seen and heard in other parts of China, are very broad in scope and of great concern to the US government). As for the economic point of view of the current situation in the Far East, the US government sent two notes to the Japanese government in October and December of last year, urging them to pay attention to it (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The news that the United States purchased six million ounces of silver from China was officially confirmed yesterday by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. He stated that this was a "normal transaction," and the price paid by the U.S. was approximately two million U.S. dollars. As for how the Chinese government will use the U.S. dollars it receives, it is difficult to know the details at this time. It is rumored that China intends to purchase wheat and transport vehicles from the United States, but Morgenthau has not heard of this yet. He also hinted that the silver is currently being loaded for shipment to the United States, but he was unwilling to disclose the route of transport. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(New York) The price of large bars of silver in New York today, quoted by Handy &amp; Harman, decreased from 34.75 cents per ounce to 35.125 cents per ounce. According to merchants, demand for silver has been quite strong recently, with bids slightly higher than the U.S. Treasury's purchase price. Over three million ounces of silver stocks have recently been shipped from New York to London, so local reserves are somewhat depleted. This is the reason for the rise in silver prices, but many believe this is only a temporary situation. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Prestige of White People in the Far East is Exhausted: South African Minister of Defence Lamented This <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Johannesburg The South African Minister of Defence, Dr. Pirow, delivered a speech here today, discussing the international situation. He said that he did not believe that a European war was inevitable and that no event directly or indirectly harming South Africa's extremely important interests had occurred. However, he felt that the situation in the Far East could not be viewed with the same comparative tranquility. The prestige of white people in the Far East has now fallen to zero. If it is not restored in the Pacific, then its prestige in the countries of the Indian Ocean will eventually fall to the same level. Once this situation occurs, we in South Africa will inevitably encounter the possibility of repercussions. The danger is not difficult to imagine. The most lamentable thing is that European countries are now blindly seeking revenge against each other, forgetting that the prestige of white people is not the prestige of any particular country, but the prestige of the entire white race.

<p>Chicago The son of an American millionaire, known as the "Iron Lung" man, Mr. Snyter, suddenly obtained a marriage license today and married Miss Laigen, a 25-year-old family friend. The wedding took place at the Snyter family home here. Mr. Snyter did not leave his iron lung during the ceremony. The newlyweds will honeymoon in Mr. Snyter's trailer, which is equipped with special equipment to carry the iron lung and other supplies. According to reports, Mr. Snyter went to Peiping with his father, where he suddenly contracted polio. Fortunately, he obtained an iron lung, which artificially assisted his breathing, allowing him to preserve his life. He stayed in Peiping until he was able to move somewhat, and was then escorted back to the United States with medical care, never leaving the iron lung. It is said that Mr. Snyter is now gradually recovering and can "live outside the lung" for a short time. Mr. Snyter recently went to the sacred cave of Lourdes in France to bathe, as it is said that the spring water in the cave has the divine power to cure strange diseases. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Chicago The bride, Miss Laigen, is very beautiful and a classmate of Mr. Snyter's sister. During the wedding, the "lung man" said "I do" to the pastor while lying in the iron lung. His sister stood beside him. The iron lung man continued to say that they would go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon to see Niagara Falls. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Washington Senator Schwellenbach, a Democrat from Washington State, recently sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, advocating a ban on the shipment of military supplies to Japan, and proposed two methods: (1) According to the laws enacted by the United States during the previous European war, the President may prevent the export of all military supplies. It may be invoked now. (2) Urge industrialists to suspend the shipment of military supplies to Japan, saying that last year Secretary of State Hull advised aircraft factories not to sell aircraft to countries that bombed civilians. This advice had remarkable results. If the same could be done for other types of military supplies, it would surely be effective. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(London) Britain warned Germany yesterday that the days of Germany's "bloodless conquests" are over. The warning was conveyed to the German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksen, by British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. The German ambassador is scheduled to return to Berlin today to report to the German government and was instructed to convey the above warning to Chancellor Hitler. The British warning was issued after the Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczynski, returned here from Warsaw. The Polish ambassador had met with his home government for four days. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) German Ambassador Dirksen left London this afternoon for a regular annual vacation of several weeks. He had visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday to bid farewell. This was Dirksen's first contact with the Foreign Secretary since February. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is rumored that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop recently sent a letter to French Foreign Minister Bonnet explaining Germany's position on the Danzig issue and requesting that France not interfere in Eastern European affairs. This statement was firmly denied by responsible parties, who said that French Foreign Minister Bonnet had explained France's position on the issue of the Free City of Danzig when he received German Ambassador Welczeck on July 1. Several days later, Ambassador Welczeck met with Foreign Minister Bonnet again and verbally conveyed a note from Foreign Minister Ribbentrop explaining Germany's position. Apart from this, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop made no other proposals. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Polish Ambassador to Britain Raczynski visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this morning after returning to London last night to discuss the Danzig issue. Responsible parties declared that the Foreign Secretary had reiterated the guarantees offered by Britain to the ambassador and expressed confidence in the actions taken by the Polish government in the current crisis. Ambassador Raczynski also stated the Polish government's attitude, saying that if there are sudden events in Danzig, such as the authorities of the city declaring the actual incorporation into Germany, all are verbal statements and the Poland does not intend to overemphasize, but if the authorities of Danzig declare the amendment of the constitution and change the current system, then it shall be regarded as invalid. At that time, if the city council still wants to implement the amendment of the constitution, it will take appropriate steps to prevent it by force. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Danzig Following a mass meeting here last night, National Socialist Party leader Forster immediately telegraphed to the Führer, Hitler, stating, "Tens of thousands of Danzig citizens held a mass meeting tonight to protest Poland's threat to Danzig. The citizens of Danzig's faith in the Führer remains unchanged, and their loyalty to the Führer will never waver." (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It was announced here last night that the 25th anniversary of the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg will be commemorated at the Tannenberg Memorial in East Prussia on August 17. At that time, Führer Hitler will deliver a speech to 40,000 veterans. In the early morning of that day, more than 2,000 people will line up in front of the Tannenberg Memorial to lay wreaths, followed by the awarding of medals to meritorious soldiers. A large-scale parade will be held at noon, and air force will also participate in the parade. East Prussia is currently making major preparations. There is a military cemetery in Hohenstein, near Tannenberg, where the late General Hindenburg is also buried. National flags have been hung all around to express remembrance. The railway company will schedule 58 special trains on that day to welcome residents from various places to Tannenberg. The route taken by the trains will go through the Polish Corridor. It is estimated that 20,000 members of the Hitler Youth will travel by car. (Haitong, 11th)</p>

<p>Salzburg Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here at noon today and will go to the town of Fuschl in the suburbs in the afternoon to meet with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Führer Hitler is currently resting at his villa in Berchtesgaden, which is only half an hour away from this city. It is not yet known whether Foreign Minister Ciano will visit him. According to well-informed sources, the Italian and German foreign ministers will broadly review various political issues. The talks may conclude this evening, and a communique is expected to be issued. It is generally believed that Foreign Minister Ciano will remain here until the 13th of this month before returning home. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano, accompanied by the Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vitetti, and several senior officials, went to Salzburg in the Austrian province of Germany this afternoon, and is expected to arrive there at 11:20 a.m. tomorrow and meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in the afternoon. On the eve of his departure, he received British Ambassador to Italy Sir Loraine, and it is said that the talks in Salzburg were involved. Political figures here recently declared that the meeting between the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy is purely a "normal contact" between the foreign ministers of the two Axis powers, in order to "review the common policies of both countries." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano departed from here at 7:15 pm this afternoon for Salzburg to visit German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. It is generally believed that the important issues to be discussed will be the Danzig situation and Japan's entry into a military alliance. This meeting between the German and Italian diplomatic authorities is arranged according to the first and second articles of the German-Italian alliance. The Axis powers now believe that the progress of the encirclement plan by the democratic countries threatens the common interests of the two countries. Officials here also believe that the U.S. termination of the trade treaty with Japan implies indirect participation in the front line of democratic countries. Although people here do not believe that the Danzig issue could lead to war, the recent trend of the Italian government seems to recognize that a Danzig war is possible, because the tension between the two opposing groups is increasing. According to an essay published in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia today, the purpose of the meeting between Ciano and Ribbentrop is to ascertain the stage of German-Italian military and political cooperation and to discuss the global situation and various developments after the signing of the German military alliance on May 22. The domestic and foreign position of Europe is currently unclear, and the encirclement policy of the democratic countries makes the future very dark. There is a need for constant preparedness for war, so the diplomatic authorities of the two countries have to calmly consider the facts and possibilities in general issues. What they are studying is not limited to Europe, but will involve other parts of the world such as the Far East, and is not limited to the present but will take into account the future.

<h3 id="e29">Forster's Speech: Danzig Should Return to Germany: Says Poland is Actively Provoking: Hitler Awaits Opportunity to Act <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster delivered an important speech here this evening. A loudspeaker was placed every fifty meters in the city, and those who listened attentively were mostly National Socialist Party members wearing uniforms. Ordinary residents and soldiers listened in various coffee shops. The speech was divided into two parts. The first part attacked Poland, and the second part used various arguments to prove that Danzig indeed had reasons to merge with Germany, with particular emphasis on historical arguments.</p>
<p>Forster first said that those in Poland who provoke war are constantly threatening with war, and everything they do is aimed at increasing the Polish people's hatred of Germany. "We firmly believe that once the appropriate time arrives, Führer Hitler will definitely take appropriate action. The Polish newspapers are now actively conducting propaganda, but in fact, no matter how provocative the threat of war may be, we will never have any fear. During this tense period, we National Socialists must find a way to prevent the citizens of Danzig from falling into despair. All citizens can trust that the National Socialist Party leaders will take the necessary actions at the appropriate time. In recent weeks, we have done our best to defend against various attacks or acts of violence. Poland should know that Danzig is not isolated and helpless. On the contrary, Danzig's homeland, Greater Germany, and Führer Hitler, are determined to help us. If Poland dares to attack, it must be repelled. Looking at the countries of Europe, only Poland has as bad a relationship with its neighbors as the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union. The ethnic minorities in its country have also created problems, with the Ukrainian ethnic group being a particularly thorny issue. In addition, Poland has built a large-scale arsenal in Westerplatte near the port of Danzig and is destroying Danzig's economic structure. Countless such acts."</p>
<p>As for the merger of Danzig with Germany, there are various arguments that can be cited: (1) Political figures in both Britain and France have said that the separation of Danzig from Germany was a big mistake. Churchill, leader of the extreme wing of the British Conservative Party, declared in 1932 that if Britain wanted to earnestly help lay the foundation for peace, then the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues had to be resolved, which is a fair point. How could France tolerate it if another country opened a corridor between Nancy and Le Havre in France? (2) Danzig was owned by Germany when it was founded as far back as 800 years ago. (3) Polish King Batory attacked Danzig in 1576 but was eventually repulsed by the citizens. Today, the citizens are not afraid of the cannons of Polish Chief of Staff Smigly-Rydz, just as their ancestors were not afraid of King Batory. (4) Since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, the citizens of Danzig, unwilling to separate from Germany, have repeatedly protested based on the Four Principles of the late U.S. President Wilson, but have not succeeded. (5) Danzig's economy has been hit hard by the separation. (6) Polish people often bully the people of Danzig.</p>
<p>In short, the citizens of Danzig firmly believe that the day of liberation is not far away and should express their loyalty to Führer Hitler and are willing to merge with Germany. "Why don't we swear, no matter what happens, the citizens of Danzig must unite. Danzig is sacred German land, and we will use all our strength to repel anyone who tries to attack it. We will execute the orders issued by Führer Hitler. Hopefully, we can gather here again in a short period of time, not for a demonstration, but to celebrate the incorporation of this city into Greater Germany." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">British and French Military Representatives Arrive in Moscow: London Times Describes Soviet Military Strength <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The military delegations of Britain and France arrived here today. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times recently published an article from its Moscow correspondent with the title "The Soviet Army is Extremely Powerful," which said, "The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, commanded by Soviet Defense Commissar General Voroshilov, has extremely strong combat power. In terms of numbers, in peacetime it has slightly fewer than three million men, including more than 100 infantry divisions and at least 30 cavalry divisions. Because the country's railway lines and road lines have not been fully developed, and its remote areas in Asia are mostly grasslands, deserts, and mountainous areas, cavalry is very effective. In wartime, once mobilization is completed, the number of soldiers can reach four million. According to the country's conscription system, all able-bodied men must serve for two years, so the number of reservists should be around twelve million. In other words, if the country decides to fight, there will be no shortage of manpower. According to recent information from military experts, Soviet soldiers are well-trained, brave, and well-equipped with the latest weapons. The quality of the lower-ranking officers is very good due to traditional training, but they are not very full of initiative and have not been able to bravely shoulder responsibilities. Recently, this shortcoming has spread to higher-ranking officers. The reason for this is said to be the purge movement several years ago. The main goal of the purge movement was to increase the loyalty of the troops, but the impact weakened the combat power of the troops. In terms of petroleum, which is most needed in modern warfare, the Soviet Union is second only to the United States in production. The country's Baku oil fields are world-famous. There is no need to explain further. There are also important oil fields between the Volga River and the Ishim River, known as "Baku II," which can already produce 6,000 tons of oil per day. In addition, the neighboring countries of Iran and Iraq can also provide large quantities of supplies." The correspondent also discussed the issue of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries, saying, "The width of the railway tracks in the country and Poland is different, which is an obstacle, but it is not difficult to overcome if necessary. According to general speculation, if the Soviet Union is attacked by another country, the enemy will attack from the north. The country's army will hold exercises in the Leningrad Military District this year, the significance of which is very important. It is generally believed that if the independence of Estonia or Latvia is seriously threatened, Soviet troops will definitely cross the border to take action. The final difficulty in the negotiations on the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is still the question of how to define "indirect aggression." The reason for this is this." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Another Tragic Bombing in Wuzhou: 400-500 Casualties; American Church Properties Also Bombed <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence: Wuzhou is the only trading port in Guangxi. Before the West River was blockaded, over a dozen merchant ships sailing directly from Hong Kong to Wuzhou generally flew British flags. There were six single-trip vessels and four tugboats sailing directly from Guangzhou to Wuzhou. Navigation to and from Wuzhou was at its peak. Although Wuzhou's commerce was said to be developed, there were no warehouses established on the shore. All wholesale storage of import and export goods was done on large wooden rafts built on the riverbank. These rafts served both as berths for ships and as warehouses for storage. The "Renhe Raft," "Tianhe Raft," "Yixing Raft," and "Xiyu Raft" of the British merchants were the most famous. The area along the Wuzhou riverbank stretched for several miles, from the customs house downstream to the Fu River estuary upstream, filled with wooden rafts. In addition to those operated by the aforementioned British merchants, there were more than 20 others, including "Dongnan Raft," "Hongyi Raft," "Fusheng Raft," "Guangxing Raft," "Lihang Raft," and "Renxin Raft," anchored at Niushi Wharf, Tiezhu Wharf, and the Fu River estuary, respectively. Electric-powered boats and tugboats sailing to various ports upstream of Wuzhou (i.e., Guiping, Jiangkou, Guixian, Liuzhou, Nanning, Pingle, etc.) mostly docked at the Fu River estuary. Ships and tugboats sailing downstream of Wuzhou (i.e., Duchen, Zhaoqing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, etc.) mostly docked near the customs house. The area around the Wuzhou riverbank, serving as the location for wharves, warehouses, and customs houses, became a prosperous zone. Because Wuzhou was a great commercial port of Guangxi and also occupied an important military position, the Japanese army repeatedly and indiscriminately bombed Wuzhou. In the two years of the war, it was subjected to dozens of intense bombings. The most tragic was one in June of last year. In that raid, twelve Japanese planes invaded the city, dropping dozens of demolition and incendiary bombs on areas such as Dongmen, Nanmen, Zhuyi Street, Xiaolong Bridge, Huiguanxia Street, and Xiashe Street. Four or five hundred houses were destroyed, and four or five hundred people were killed or injured, creating an unprecedented tragedy. The local government had long ordered the evacuation of the population and extensively dug air raid shelters, capable of accommodating tens of thousands of people. The passive air defense setup was quite comprehensive. Since then, although Japanese planes have continuously attacked Wuzhou, none were as severe as the one mentioned above. Nowadays, as soon as an air raid alarm sounds in Wuzhou, police officers and air defense personnel direct the public to take refuge in air raid shelters. As a result, the number of people injured or killed in bombings has gradually decreased. In recent months, Japanese planes have rarely attacked Wuzhou. The general public, seeing the city's order restored, those who had previously evacuated by order have returned to live in the urban areas. Commerce in the city has gradually become bustling again. Although Sanshui, downstream on the West River, has been blockaded by the Japanese army, navigation is still possible to Zhaoqing. The upstream areas of Liuzhou, Nanning, Pingle, and Guilin are unobstructed. Furthermore, the flow of travelers is more crowded and prosperous than before. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army, discovering that Wuzhou's commerce was gradually recovering, sent eighteen planes on the twenty-sixth of last month, taking off from the Sanshui area, to attack Wuzhou. Several of them were single-wing, twin-engine heavy bombers. After entering the airspace over the city, they specifically targeted the wooden rafts and ships on the riverbank, dropping no fewer than a hundred bombs. In addition, a large number of bombs fell on Dadong Road, Dadong Shangxia Street, Wenhua Street, Xuehou Street, Beishan Foot, Dongzheng Street, Cheyi Street, Dabeijie Street, Nanhuan Road, Xuede Street, and Yuren Street, creating over twenty disaster zones. The number of deaths and injuries reached four to five hundred people. According to preliminary investigations, the devastation from this bombing in Wuzhou was more than double that of the one in June of last year. Over five hundred shops, residences, schools, hospitals, and public places were burned and collapsed. Over two hundred river ferries and civilian boats, large and small, were burned or sunk. Seven of the British merchants' "Renhe Raft," "Yixing Raft," "Xixing Raft," and "Guangxing Raft" were burned and sunk. Magnificently built hotels, such as the Datong Hotel, Jinhua Hotel, and Dongya Hotel, were all destroyed. Four of the regularly scheduled ferries between Zhaoqing and Wuzhou - the Lishang Ferry, Guangxing Ferry, Duanjiang Ferry, and Huian Ferry - were sunk. The Lishang Ferry, which was usually fully loaded with over two hundred passengers, was preparing to depart for Zhaoqing when the sudden air raid alarm went off. Unable to escape in time, all the passengers on board were sunk with the ship. Only seven people survived. Among the foreign church properties destroyed by the bombing were the American Baptist Church’s Hongdao Bible College and the Sida Hospital. One bomb fell just over ten yards from the Wuzhou customs house, with shrapnel penetrating the offices inside. That day, the city was engulfed in flames, and corpses littered the river. The work of rescuing the injured and collecting bodies has been ongoing for three days and is still not finished. The tragic situation is hard to describe in words.</p>
<p>The Wuzhou Municipal Office is currently making arrangements for the aftermath. For days, they have been supervising police officers and service personnel from various districts to clean up the disaster areas, clear away rubble, treat the injured, and bury the corpses. They are also advising citizens to evacuate again and restricting boats on the river from docking closely together to avoid becoming targets for indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes. All ships traveling to and from upstream and downstream, whether departing or docking, are required to load and unload goods and passengers and travel at night to avoid air raids and reduce casualties. However, Wuzhou's commerce has been repeatedly devastated by Japanese planes and may become even more desolate and deserted in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Major Clash Between Japanese and Puppet Troops in Suzhou City; Casualties on Both Sides Affect Innocent People <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Ever since the Japanese started using the tactic of "controlling Chinese with Chinese" by recruiting ignorant people to organize puppet troops for their own use, there have been quite a few among them who are somewhat sensible. For example, Wan Yunlong and Jiang Xiaosi in Suzhou, who originally served as puppet detectives in the "Second General Team of the Provincial Police Force," were generally righteous on normal days. A puppet "pacification detective, Fan Renming, normally curried favor with the Japanese and puppets, framing innocent civilians, hoping to gain rewards and recognition. Wan and Jiang resented him. On the night of the 26th of last month, around 10 PM, they killed Fan at Sunjia Bridge. On the morning of the eighth, the "puppet troops" suddenly arrested Yang Jinbao, who had learned the inside story, at the Letian Tea House on Daoqian Street. Later, they arrested Wan and Jiang at the Shengping Tea House outside the gate. Around 9 AM that morning, Mo Huimin, the "puppet detective chief," and Chen Jinhai, a "puppet detective," were about to escort Jiang Xiaosi to the "puppet commander" Gong Guoliang for interrogation. When they passed the gate of the "puppet provincial government," Jiang suddenly shouted patriotic slogans and ran on the road, causing a misunderstanding among the "puppet special task force," who chased after him and fired warning shots. The Japanese troops at Qimen, hearing the gunfire, suspected a change of events and rushed into the city to open fire, joined by Japanese military police. Suspecting that the "puppet troops" were rebelling, they were greatly alarmed. "At the time, the gunfire rang out, counting hundreds of rounds. People from Northeast Street to Shange Bridge fled in panic, shops closed their doors in a hurry, and Lindun Road turned into a dead street, resembling a battlefield. At the same time, the puppet troops suspected that the Japanese army was a guerrilla force that had broken into the city and fired indiscriminately. Meanwhile, the "Second General Team" of the puppet army, dissatisfied with the arrest of Wan and Jiang, gathered hundreds of people and launched a large-scale attack on the "Pacification Team." The two "puppet detectives," Mo and Chen, seeing that they were outnumbered, fled into the alleys. In the chaos, both the Japanese and the puppet troops suffered casualties, and more than ten innocent people were also affected. Currently, Wan and Jiang are being guarded by the "Second General Team" of the puppet army. After the incident, the people of Suzhou all turned pale at the mention of it, lamenting that in this thorny area of the city, disturbances arise out of nowhere.</p>

<h3 id="e40">The Failure of the South China Expedition; Li Huitang's Flight to Java; A Secret Story of the Hong Kong Football Scene <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong 5th Dispatch) As of today, the South China Athletic Association's expeditionary football team has played 22 matches overseas, with 15 wins, 5 draws, and 2 losses. This is not a bad result, but it is also reasonable to say that it is mediocre, because the South China Association used to be invincible, especially in expeditions in Southeast Asia, where it rarely suffered defeats. This expedition has only reached the halfway point, and there have already been two defeats (both with inevitable causes) and five draws, which cannot be considered satisfactory. The expeditionary team lost to the South Vietnam A team and the Singapore All-Star team.</p>
<p>Player Selection Issues</p>
<p>Mo Qing, the leader of the South China team, indeed had many difficulties in selecting personnel before the expedition. Before the end of the Hong Kong football season, the South China team was already advocating the expedition, but it was delayed again and again until the end of May. There were two reasons for this: (1) the selection of players was difficult; (2) the terms of Java were under negotiation. Some people may wonder why the selection of personnel would be difficult since South China has two A teams, plus many B and C team athletes.</p>
<p>However, one day, Mo Qing told a reporter, "Only thirteen or fourteen players from the South China A and B teams are at the A team level. Zhang Rongcai, Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Liu Qingcai, Liang Rongzhao, Yang Shuiyi, Deng Guangsen, Feng Jingxiang, Chen Dehui, and Li Zhaorong are undoubtedly qualified for the expedition. I am not very fond of Luo Douwen; he still lacks control of the ball. Liu Songsheng has not touched the ball for months, Zhang Jinhai's playing style is different from other generals in South China, and Mai Shaohan is injured again. It's really something worth considering." There is some considerable truth to what he says.</p>
<p>A few days later, he came up with a solution after racking his brains.</p>
<p>Attempt to Restore the Huahua Cup</p>
<p>As the chairman of the football department of the association, he recalled that the Singapore Chinese team and the Hong Kong Chinese team have always had the "Huahua Cup" intercity competition, going to each other’s city every other year, according to the regulations established in 1925. However, Singapore has visited Hong Kong twice, while Hong Kong has only returned the visit once. The reason is that the ticket revenue is to be fully received by the home team, and the away team must pay their own travel expenses. The association in Hong Kong has been financially strained over the years, so this has never been accomplished. Mo Qing, in order to clear the debt of fulfilling the Huahua Cup competition, planned to discuss with the Dongfang and Guanghua Chinese teams to borrow Xu Jingcheng, Hou Chenchao, Hou Rongsheng, and Zhuo Shijin, so that the strength of the entire team would be enhanced and the travel expenses would be borne by the South China Association. In theory, the association's wish would be fulfilled, and the South China Association's personnel problem would also be resolved.</p>
<p>Ran Into a Nail with the Dongfang Association</p>
<p>Therefore, he invited Xu Heng, the new director of the football department of the Dongfang Association, for lunch and discussed the plan. As a result, Xu Heng's answer was fair enough: "There is no objection to this matter, but Hou Chenchao's leave may be a problem. The players of the Dongfang and Guanghua associations cannot depart at the same time as the South China Association's expeditionary team and should go directly to Singapore, so as not to be criticized by public opinion."</p>
<p>After running into this nail, he was also attacked by the main figures of the South China Association, with the reason being, "Why not support the players of our association and borrow personnel from outsiders?" As a result, Mo Qing had to change his approach and individually contacted Hou Rongsheng and Zhuo Shijin, and instructed Liu Songsheng to practice. Finally, Yang Genbao and Li Guowei were selected to accompany the expedition, and Tan Zhenhui was drafted at the last minute.</p>
<p>Two Conditions in Java</p>
<p>Speaking of the Java conditions, that is the reason why Li Huitang was late to depart. The conditions put forward by Java were two: (1) The first match of the expeditionary team is in Java; (2) The members of the expeditionary team must include Li Huitang, Li Tiansheng, and Feng Jingxiang, with neither condition being dispensable. If it can be done, a deposit of 7,000 guilders will be paid first.</p>
<p>Mo Qing, because the previous expedition to Vietnam (Saigon, Hanoi, etc.) achieved good results, could not forget Saigon and thought that the trip to Java would be expensive and require many advances, so he decided to go to Haiphong and Hanoi first, and then get closer to Java bit by bit. Li Huitang, due to his duties at the Swedish foreign company, could not make a long-term expedition. Therefore, he replied to Mo Qing, "Since the first condition cannot be met at all, I have no need for it."</p>
<p>Now, the Chinese community in Java and the South China Association here are discussing the matter, and the expeditionary team is also consulting with them. Huitang really wants to go to Java to see the football skills of the overseas Chinese, which can be used to assess the strength of next year's World Games team. At the same time, he has a Chinese business deal with the Swedish foreign company that needs to be negotiated in Java, so he decided to go for three weeks and return to Hong Kong. His departure has little to do with Mo Qing's persuasion.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Tightening of the Black Market for Foreign Exchange in Shanghai: Not Detrimental to Monetary Policy; Domestic Financial Stability Increasingly on the Right Track; Government's Purchasing Power Abroad Remains Normal <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Citizens Should Stop Using Luxury Goods to Save Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>After the government's adjustment of monetary policy, it has become increasingly sound. The national finance has entered the right track. After the Black Market Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee let it run its course, the black market foreign exchange continued to shrink sharply, hindering speculators and making it difficult to import luxury goods, which is beneficial and not detrimental to China's wartime finance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Monetary Policy: Increasingly Sound</p>
<p>China's monetary policy is one of the soundest in the world. Collecting gold and silver, having sufficient reserves, prohibiting imports, and encouraging exports are all aimed at achieving a balance of international payments. Moreover, various foreign exchange control methods are used to prevent Japanese attacks, adjust the financial market, seek flexibility in chips, and establish a domestic exchange management committee to regulate local financial circulation. Therefore, from the perspective of the nature of wartime finance, the government's measures have been well-planned and meticulous. However, it is still inevitable that the value of legal tender will fall in the dark market. This is due to the fact that the government's power does not extend to the occupied areas, which is not the fault of the government's wartime financial policy, and it is certainly not that China's economy is exposing weaknesses in wartime.</p>
<p>Domestic Finance: Already on the Right Track</p>
<p>The maintenance of wartime finance is (1) for wartime financial expenditures, (2) for the adjustment of the general financial market, and (3) for the maintenance of foreign purchasing power. The Chinese government has never resorted to paper money policies, and wartime currency has not inflated. The increase in prices in various places is due to demand exceeding supply, not due to the increase in currency. The domestic financial market has also entered the right track due to the effective cooperation between government banks and local financial authorities. In terms of foreign purchasing power, due to the government's control of the exchange of exported goods and loans from friendly countries, coupled with the inherent foreign exchange position, the war has been going on for two years, and the Chinese government's purchasing power abroad remains as usual.</p>
<p>Black Market Exchange Rate Falls: Does Not Harm the Overall Situation</p>
<p>The customs offices in non-occupied areas all have a trade surplus, while the customs offices in occupied areas have the largest trade deficit. This shows that the government's policy of encouraging exports under foreign exchange control has been very effective. The black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai is entirely the work of traitors. However, this does not harm China's wartime finance, but benefits China's economy. (1) Because the black market exchange rate for foreign exchange has fallen, the import of non-essential goods is prevented, and domestic production can take the opportunity to develop. (2) Because the black market for foreign exchange has fallen sharply, the conspiracy to take foreign exchange is hindered, which is enough to stabilize the position of legal tender in the occupied areas. The only impact is that the prices of foreign raw materials have soared, making the lives of some urban residents uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Occupied Areas: Currency Contraction</p>
<p>The Shanghai market currency chips in the occupied areas are striving to shrink, in order to reduce the public's purchasing power, so that prices can be kept low. At the same time, due to the contraction of market chips, those who hold foreign exchange positions will have to throw out foreign exchange and exchange it for a part of legal tender for the sake of legal tender needs. In this way, both foreign exchange and prices have the effect of adjustment. Therefore, in today's special environment in the Shanghai market, if the market chips are increased, the result will be to encourage speculation and lead capital to improper investment, and both society and people's livelihood will suffer. At the same time, it is hoped that Shanghai citizens will automatically stop using luxury goods, so that they will automatically stop importing them, in order to save foreign exchange consumption.</p>
<p>Non-Essential Goods: Affected</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that Roger, the British representative of the Foreign Exchange Fund Management Committee, has returned to Hong Kong from Shanghai, but this decision to come to Shanghai is indeed related to the Chinese monetary system and the black market for foreign exchange. Although the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange is a special situation in the occupied areas, and the price is low, it is beneficial and not detrimental to China. However, merchants engaged in non-essential goods and luxury goods are greatly affected in their business. Therefore, there have been no orders for these goods recently, and those who have already ordered but have not shipped are also negotiating to cancel the orders. However, essential goods can still be imported, but due to the exchange rate relationship, the cost has increased.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Shrinks Again: Foreign Goods Soar</p>
<p>The HSBC Bank of England's foreign exchange listing shrank again yesterday morning. The British exchange rate was three pence two five, and the US exchange rate was six yuan three one two five, creating an unprecedentedly low price. According to market news, the HSBC Bank's listing has repeatedly fallen, or it is related to the British representative Roger's coming to Shanghai for consultation with the Equalization Committee. According to general observation, there may be a trend of continued shrinkage. As for the black market for foreign exchange in Tianjin, it has fallen along with Shanghai. It is heard that the British exchange rate has broken through the three-pence mark. Because the black market for foreign exchange is tight, the prices of essential goods have soared. For example, the price of gasoline from Asia and Mobil has increased again yesterday, and the ex-warehouse price is two yuan two per gallon.</p>
<p>Gold Rises: Securities Rebound</p>
<p>The gold dark market assembly point opened yesterday morning, and the price soared endlessly due to the sharp contraction of the black market for foreign exchange. The morning closing price was 4,615 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 4,670 yuan. The silver building industry's listing, Datong, was 440 yuan in the morning and 470 yuan in the afternoon. However, the exchange rate discount is still between 200 yuan and 210 yuan. The securities dark market rebounded yesterday. Unified Class A was 49 yuan, up 6 cents, Class B was 42 yuan and 4 cents, up 9 cents, Class C was 40 yuan and 2 and a half cents, up 7 cents, Class D was 38 yuan and 8 cents, up 2 and a half cents, Class E was 39 yuan and 7 cents, up 7 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Tomorrow is the Second Anniversary of the Shanghai War: Defense of the Concessions is More Stringent; Defense Forces and Business Corps are All Mobilized This Morning; Sandbags are Placed Near All Newspaper Offices <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have implemented special precautions for three days, and the situation is quite good. However, as tomorrow is the anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai War, the security will be strengthened from this morning. All the defense forces stationed in Shanghai from various countries will be mobilized. The tense situation will be unprecedented in the city's history, making it impossible for those who plot to sabotage to succeed. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Defense Forces and Business Corps Mobilized This Morning</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have been taking special precautions since the morning of the 9th. As of yesterday, it has been three days, and the situation is very peaceful and good. As tomorrow is the second anniversary of the Shanghai War, the authorities have decided to strengthen security from this morning to make the defense more stringent. In addition to all police officers being mobilized, all defense forces stationed in Shanghai from the UK, the US, and Italy will also be mobilized. The International Business Corps has been ordered to mobilize. From this morning, there will be one regiment and three battalions of troops, ten armored vehicles, and the anti-aircraft team and the US machine gun team will all be on duty, distributed at the intersections of various roads. The tense situation is more serious than the August 13th anniversary last year, and it will be unprecedented in the city's history, making it impossible for those who plot to sabotage to succeed.</p>
<p>Court Security: More Stringent</p>
<p>Since the 2nd, security has been strict in various places in the concessions, resulting in a special reduction in criminal cases compared to before. From today, this state of alert will be further strengthened. The Chinese district chiefs of the four districts A, B, C, and D of the police department, Liu Rongdai, Wu Genyuan, Yao Jialin, and Jin Shiying, will personally go to inspect the areas under their jurisdiction. The Chinese and Western patrol chiefs of each police station will also ride motorcycles and other vehicles to patrol the roads. The gate of the First Special District Local Court on North Zhejiang Road in the concession has been tightened, and the security forces guarding the inside and outside of the court have also been increased. The temporary office of the First Special Court attached to the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School on Weihaiwei Road and the Second Branch of the High Court at the intersection of Chengdu Road on the same road, in addition to the police stations sending police to guard, the US military in charge of the area also sent officers to each of the two courts, leading dozens of soldiers with live ammunition to assist in the defense. The seriousness of the situation can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Sandbag Embankments Installed at the Entrances of Various Newspapers</p>
<p>In order to effectively protect the safety of various foreign newspaper offices, the police authorities have specially set up a sandbag fortress near the Zi Lin West News, the Continental News, the Times, the Chang Geng Li Sino-US Daily, and the Hankou Road Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao from the 10th, and assigned the International Business Corps to be stationed there to prevent unfortunate incidents from happening again.</p>
<p>Tea Houses and Hotels: Stepped-Up Searches</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have distributed detective police on various roads to conduct strict searches of vehicles and pedestrians. Moreover, as hotels and tea houses are often places where criminals hide, they have ordered detective police to go to various public places such as tea houses and hotels to conduct searches and interrogations in recent days, which is extremely strict. Anyone with suspicious behavior will be taken back to the police station. At 5 pm yesterday, the Central Police Station of the Public Concession sent detective police to search the Jin Chun Tea House at the intersection of Pingwang Street on Five Roads. It was not completed until 5:15. As a result, three people were arrested for suspicious behavior. When the detectives were getting into the car, a ragged person was also arrested.</p>
<p>North Jiangxi Road: Blocked Gaps</p>
<p>North Jiangxi Road, starting from the north end of the waterworks bridge in the south and ending at a row of shops and households and alleys in the east end of Lao Bazi Road, was blocked by the Japanese with wooden poles and barbed wire on the 29th of last month. However, the blockade line still left gaps for residents to enter and exit. No pass was required before. However, from yesterday, the Japanese, except for one gap at Hai'ning Road, still allowed residents in the area to enter and exit, but Japanese soldiers have been stationed at the guard post, and they must enter and exit with a temporary pass issued two months ago. Other gaps, such as Wen Jian Shi Road, have been blocked. As for the barbed wire set up by the concession authorities at the west end of the road, everything is as usual. Only the two entrances of Hai'ning Road and Qipu Road can enter the road, and the police conduct inspections of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Various Places in Nanshi: Placed Guns and Cannons</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Nanshi began to be on alert from yesterday. Small steel cannons and heavy machine guns have been placed in fortresses at Xietu Road and Tushanwan. The traffic on the Shanghai-West and Shanghai-Min highways has been closed. Five small fortresses around the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters in Wanzhu School, a refugee area in the city, have also been set up with artillery positions, and ten mechanized tanks have been transferred. Guided by two Japanese military motorcycles, they patrol the two roads of the Republic of China's ring city in Nanshi all day long and drive to Longhua Road, Xietu Road, and Tushanwan to be on alert.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Japanese Army Arrests Civilians at Will: Shoots Innocent Farmers: Searches House to House, More Than 100 People Arrested: Rumors of War in Chuansha and Nanhui <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>At about 7 am yesterday, when more than a dozen Japanese soldiers were patrolling Chengjiaqiao on Hongqiao Road in Shanghai West, a farmer, a man in his 30s, ran towards Luo Bie Gen Road when he saw the Japanese soldiers coming. Seeing this, the Japanese soldiers chased after him and fired shots. When they chased him to Wang Manshui Bridge, the man had been shot several times and fell dead in the cotton field by the roadside. When the Japanese soldiers heard the alarm, a large team rushed to the scene and searched the houses and shops of residents in Chengjiaqiao one by one. As a result, more than 100 innocent villagers were arrested and sent to the Japanese military department on Lincoln Road for temporary detention.</p>
<p>Shooting Farmers</p>
<p>The English Greater America Evening News said that a team of 40 or 50 Japanese soldiers arrived at Chengjiaqiao, a small village at the corner of Hongqiao Road and Luo Bie Gen Road, by truck and armored car at 7 am this morning (the 11th) and immediately surrounded it. A farmer was frightened and tried to escape and was immediately shot and killed by Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Arresting More Than 100 People</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers then searched house to house for four hours. It was heard that eight pistols were found in a certain house, so they pointed out that the people in the house and their neighbors were suspected of being guerrillas and arrested them together. More than 100 people were arrested, including women and children. The Japanese soldiers did not retreat with more than 100 people until 11 am. It is expected that they have been taken to several headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Increases Defense</p>
<p>It is believed that the Japanese military authorities, in view of the rumors that the Chinese mobile forces intend to take widespread action, are engaged in a strong anti-guerrilla movement. This morning's search and large-scale arrest of farmers is part of this movement. The Japanese military authorities have now stepped up their defense and increased patrols in the suburbs around the city, and the inspection of travelers in these areas has become more stringent.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Warfare</p>
<p>The city has repeatedly heard news of small contacts in Pudong and other areas in the suburbs of Shanghai. Although it has not been possible to verify them one by one, gunshots and artillery fire have been heard in both the Public Concession and the French Concession, indicating that war is in progress. It is heard that the guerrillas in the interior of Pudong are very active, and the garrison has all retreated into the walled towns of Chuansha and Nanhui, as well as larger villages, to avoid surprise attacks.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Chinese and Foreign Relief Association: Overseas Fundraising: Fundraising in This City Concentrated on Disaster Relief: Major Disaster Areas Urgently Awaiting Relief <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road has recently received urgent requests for relief from disaster areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. In addition to deciding to allocate 10,000 yuan to the heavily affected counties in Anhui to handle emergency relief first, other major disaster areas are also planning relief. The board of directors of the association believes that fundraising in this city is now concentrated on relief for Shanghai's refugees, and the association's annual relief funds are mostly from overseas donations. Therefore, it has now decided that the Chinese and Western chairmen, Song Hanzhang and Father Rao Jiaju, will jointly appeal to European and American charitable organizations and overseas Chinese to donate to enable them to carry out the relief plan separately and benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers in Shanghai West: Strict Defense</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Shanghai West, in view of the approaching Shanghai War Anniversary, specially increased sentries at each pass from the day before yesterday to strictly defend against attacks. Eight armored vehicles patrol back and forth on Zhongshan Road and Hongqiao Road to prevent guerrilla ambushes. Passengers are strictly checked on Hongqiao Road, Da Xi Road, and Bai Li Nan Road. More than a dozen people have been arrested for suspicious behavior and are now being held in the Kaina Road Military Police Department.</p>
<p>Pujiang Ferries: All Suspended</p>
<p>Ferries in Wusong and Beixinjing have all been suspended. However, the ferry from the South Wharf to and from the Concession still operated as usual yesterday, but the search for passengers entering and leaving was stricter than before. According to passengers coming to the Concession from Shanghai City, news has been circulating on the ferry that the ferry will be suspended this morning and will not resume until after the 13th. Therefore, each passenger packed their goods and returned to Shanghai City on the last ferry at 4 pm yesterday to avoid staying in the Concession.</p>

<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Says That It Should Not Be Afraid to Seek Medical Treatment at This Time</p>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, in order to facilitate citizens' purchase of food, have agreed to allow rice shops in the two concessions to sell four kinds of food: sliced noodles, flour, bread, and steamed buns, without having to apply for a separate business license.</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Association: Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association held a temporary emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 3 pm yesterday at the Exchange on the second floor of the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange at 15 Edward Road. Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhou Zhizhen, Fu Qiangeng, Xing Zhigang, She Bingwen, Zhu Xiangsheng, Jiang Hongbin, Huang Zhihe, Yang Heqing, and Yan Xiaoquan attended. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussed the rice and grain issue. The result of the discussion was that it is undeniable that the rice and grain reserves in Shanghai have been reduced. In order to prepare for a rainy day, the association has repeatedly asked the concession authorities to find ways to dredge the source or order foreign rice to prepare for emergencies, but no action has been taken. It is now believed that this issue is not a matter for the rice industry alone, but is of great concern to the four or five million citizens in the city. It seems that we should not be afraid to seek medical treatment, which will cause future troubles. We should ask the two concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to quickly find ways to provide relief in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Letter to the Authorities: Seeking Relief</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Board of Works, the French Concession Board of Directors, and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Respectfully, it is hereby informed that the rice and grain reserves in Shanghai have been reduced and the sources are scarce, which is an undeniable fact. Looking back to the middle of April this year, there were still more than 600,000 bags of rice in stock, but the recent survey of rice stored in various warehouses is only more than 133,000 bags. Although the rice stored in rice shops and the rice pre-purchased by households is not included, the citizens' food supply may not be panic-stricken for a while. However, in terms of sources, only the southern route, Songjiang and Qingpu, has 2,000 to 3,000 stones of goods arriving every day, while the northern route, Xichang, Sukun and other places, is almost non-existent. As for Wuhu, the concentrated place of glaze rice, it has not been opened since July. According to the statistics, Shanghai consumes 10,000 bags of rice every day, while the goods arriving are less than one-third. The reduction of reserves and the high price of rice are all due to this. However, the outside world does not know that rice merchants are hoarding and manipulating market prices, which is not in line with the facts. What is worried about now is that there is no hoarding. If there is hoarding, how can the current situation be caused? This is known to the wise. As for the future trend, although a small number of early-season new grains in the interior have been launched, most of them will have to wait until around the Mid-Autumn Festival in the old calendar, which is still 40 to 50 days away. Even at this time, new rice may flood in, but in these 40 to 50 days, how to balance supply and demand and ensure that the people's food supply is worry-free is an urgent matter. In the past, in order to prepare for a rainy day, our association has repeatedly asked your bureau (concession authorities) to find ways to dredge the source or order foreign rice to prepare for emergencies, but unfortunately, no action has been taken. Our association believes that this issue is not a matter for the rice industry alone, but is of great concern to the four or five million citizens in Shanghai. Today, it seems that we should not be afraid to seek medical treatment, which will cause future troubles. (In addition to sending another letter to the two concession authorities) Another letter is hereby submitted to you for your consideration and prompt adoption of appropriate measures to provide relief to the people's food supply. (We hope that you will consider and handle the matter promptly by seeking relief, or collect the strength of various commercial groups in Shanghai to plan together, or find other appropriate measures to maintain the people's food supply.) We are eagerly awaiting your reply."</p>
<p>Market Dark Trading: Increasingly Rampant</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter visited the bean and rice market at 10 am yesterday. It was learned that the market's dark trading is becoming increasingly rampant. The price of No. 1 white rice has broken through the 27.5 yuan mark. There are also very few traders offering old and inferior goods. Market prices have risen accordingly. The customer help's appetite is slightly stronger. The rice shops on Water Street have stopped adding goods. People's hearts are tending to rise, the order is chaotic, and formal transactions have been suspended. Although the concession authorities are secretly investigating speculative profiteers who are hoarding, the rice merchants' greed has not been restrained, and all goods are traded outside the market, and the common people are suffering greatly. It was heard that a small number of rice shops closed down yesterday because they had no goods to offer.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Customs Patrol Ships Detained by the Japanese: Japan Agrees to Return Two Ships: The Lianxing Patrol Ship Has Been Returned: No News of the Remaining Eight Ships <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The patrol ships belonging to the Jianghai Customs include five ships: Fuxing, Lianxing, Huaxing, Wenxing, etc., one anti-smuggling ship Haiyan, three motor boats Fuwei, Yongning, Huguang, etc., and one small steamer Jiaoji, totaling ten ships. In addition, there are two grain transport ships Haiguang and Liuxing. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west in November 1937, the Japanese side has detained all the above-mentioned patrol ships and patrol boats in the Pujiang River. Later, the Japanese side found that the two grain transport ships Haiguang and Liuxing were specifically engaged in supplying food and oil to the caretakers of the lighthouses at sea, which could not be interrupted for a day, so they released the two ships Haiguang and Liuxing and returned them to the customs. However, the remaining ten ships were all occupied.</p>
<p>Affecting Maritime: Anti-Smuggling Work</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned patrol ships, the Fuxing is the largest, which is a cruiser mother ship. Its deck is equipped with eight new-style small speedboats, all of which are high-speed. The Fuxing ship is more than 400 feet long. When it was occupied, it had just been renovated and completed by the Jiangnan Shipyard not long ago. The years of construction of the other ships are also not long. Since the above-mentioned ships were occupied, it has greatly affected the anti-smuggling work of the Jianghai Customs, and the crew members of the ships have been largely dismissed and unemployed by the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>Lianxing and Yunxing: Returned by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The ships have been detained for 21 months. Although the Inspector General of Customs, Meierhe, and the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, Luofude, have negotiated many times, they have achieved no results. Moreover, the ships have been sailed away from the Pujiang River and their whereabouts have been unknown for a long time. Until the end of last week, the Japanese side returned one of the occupied patrol ships, the Lianxing, to the customs. There is also a Yunxing ship, which the Japanese side has also agreed to return to the customs recently. In the future, one Japanese customs officer will be sent to each ship to manage the anti-smuggling work. As for the remaining eight ships, Fuxing, Huaxing, Wenxing, Haiyan, Yongning, Huguang, and Jiaoji, there is still no news of their release.</p>

<p>The Zi Lin News reported that two Japanese newspapers in this port reported yesterday (the 10th) that thanks to the ingenious investigation work of the Japanese Consulate Police, they were able to arrest Chen Caifa, a member of the anti-Japanese arson gang active in the Yangshupu District. On July 7, he was arrested for trying to escape without being searched by the Japanese Consulate Police on Jidu Road in Yangshupu. An armband was found, proving that Chen was a member of the Shanghai Citizen Battlefield.</p>
<p>Rescue Iron Team</p>
<p>During the interrogation, Chen revealed the arson gang's activities in Yangshupu and Pudong. On July 29, another member, Zhuang Jinbao, was arrested in a tea house on Qiwupu Road. Based on Zhuang's confession, three other members, Yuan Changfa, Ye Youtang, and Xu Yucai, were arrested. Yuan Zhujun, who was arrested earlier this year for allegedly setting fire to</p>
<p>Japanese Mail Warehouse</p>
<p>was also a member of the gang. Zhuang Jinbao was an ironworker at the Japanese-managed Hengfeng Yarn Factory. He was accused of secretly carrying combustible chemicals into the cotton warehouse of the yarn factory and setting fire to it on May 9, "National Humiliation Day," causing a large fire. On the same day, the arson gang was ordered to burn nine other Japanese properties.</p>

<p>The Continental News reported that reliable news was received in this area yesterday (the 10th) that a US sailor was hit by a Japanese military truck in Yantai a few days ago. He lost several teeth and suffered several abrasions. He is now lying in the sick bay of the US destroyer tender ship Black Hawk and is being anesthetized to reduce the severe pain he is suffering. Although there is no danger to his life, it is expected that he will be under the care of doctors for some time. According to eyewitnesses, the sailor stepped into the road from a store in the afternoon and was hit by a Japanese military truck. According to the report obtained by the US authorities in Yantai, the driver of the truck denied hitting the sailor, saying that he saw the sailor climb out of the ditch by the roadside with his teeth knocked out and serious injuries, so he stopped the car to call for help.</p>

<p>Following the order of the Ministry of Finance, the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong have established a Domestic Remittance Management Committee. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with banking circles yesterday and learned that after the establishment of the committee, merchants in the inland areas who wish to purchase essential goods from occupied areas such as Shanghai and transfer them inland must apply to the committee for remittances. Remittances will only be approved after review, with the aim of preventing the escape of capital from the inland areas. Commercial banks, local banks, and post offices are restricted to a maximum of 100 yuan per person for remittances from Chongqing and other places to Shanghai. The post office has also stipulated a daily total remittance amount for each office, divided into first, second, and third classes, with a remittance fee of 30 to 40 yuan per 100 yuan. However, there are no restrictions on remittances from Shanghai to the inland areas. It is also stipulated that Shanghai can issue payment orders, and the inland areas can fully receive cash. No remittance fees are charged for banknotes bearing place names such as Tianjin, Shandong, Wuhan when remitting to the inland areas, aiming to encourage the inward transfer of capital. It is said that Shanghai, being an occupied area, has no need to establish a Domestic Remittance Management Committee. It is also reported that due to the management of remittances in Chongqing and other places, people are finding ways to remit small amounts to Shanghai, mostly through post offices. The post office is now handling this matter strictly.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Japanese Side Denies Supporting Anti-British Propaganda; Blames it on Spontaneous Expression of the People; States that Britain Can Take Any Action; Absolutely Denies Anti-American Activities <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that a Japanese spokesperson claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 10th) that the Japanese government does not support anti-British propaganda, whether it occurs in Nanjing, Kaifeng, or Tokyo. This is a spontaneous expression of the people, and the anti-British movement has not deteriorated into anti-foreignism, let alone anti-Americanism. A reporter first asked what the Japanese government's attitude would be if a third country began to take action to end the anti-British activities. The spokesperson replied that if the anti-British movement reaches the point of</p>
<p>endangering Britain's</p>
<p>position in China, Britain can take any action it deems appropriate, as decided by the British government. A reporter asked what would happen if Britain took action in Qingdao to stop the anti-British movement. The spokesperson replied that Qingdao is already occupied by the Japanese army, and there is no need for British action there. When asked about the bombing of the British consulate, the spokesperson distinguished between Japanese-occupied areas and Chinese-controlled areas, saying that Britain can</p>
<p>take any action in Chinese</p>
<p>controlled areas. If peace is disrupted in the occupied areas, the Japanese army and navy will take steps to curb such disruptions. A reporter asked why they hadn't done so. Another spokesperson said that anti-British propaganda does not necessarily disrupt peace; it is an expression of the people. When asked whether the Japanese side cares about protecting British interests in China, the spokesperson replied that it naturally holds this policy. Regarding the Russian proposal concerning the Henan coal mines, the Japanese Embassy spokesperson said that the issue of seizure is inaccurate.</p>
<p>These coal mines</p>
<p>are owned by Chinese merchants, who purchased equipment from Britain on credit to install it. If the loans are repaid, the coal mines will still belong to the Chinese. However, when the war broke out, the mine owners fled, and the British entered the mines. The "Beiping government" insists that the British operation of these mines is illegal, and China has the right to confiscate them. Some quarters believe that the anti-British movement has deteriorated into anti-foreign and anti-American movements, but no evidence has been found. An questioner said that Shanxi has</p>
<p>anti-American sentiments.</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied that they had not received any news, but it may be appropriate to close the churches due to the local situation. The Japanese army may take action to close the churches to protect the missionaries. Regarding the alleged anti-American sentiments in Kaifeng, when asked whether Japanese people in Kaifeng participated in anti-American propaganda, the spokesperson replied that Japanese people in Kaifeng, Nanjing, or Tokyo may participate in it individually, but the Japanese government is not involved.</p>

<p>The Dalian Maru, Fengtian Maru, and Qingdao Maru, three ships operated by Japanese merchants on the North China, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Dalian routes, have recently been seen with two to three hundred Chinese workers in blue cloth clothing being forced onto the ships under the suppression of the Japanese army fifteen minutes before each ship sets sail from the Hongkou Huangpu Wharf. Once the Chinese workers are all on board, the ships immediately set sail. According to those working at the wharf, no fewer than ten thousand people have been transported so far. These people come from various Japanese strongholds in the occupied areas, having been recruited due to economic pressure. The exact nature of the work they are being transported to do is unknown.</p>

<p>Chen Weiling, a native of Wuxi and an employee of the Da Zhong Firm at 830 Lane 8, Seymour Road, enjoys dancing and became acquainted with Lin Shuzhen (19 years old), a local dancer at the Shanghai Dance Hall on Fujian Road. Over time, they developed feelings for each other and agreed to marry. Lin Shuzhen changed her stage name and went to dance at the Weigong Dance Hall on Ningbo Road. On July 26th, Lin Shuzhen</p>
<p>suddenly disappeared</p>
<p>and did not return for many days. Her mother, Lin Ma, was suspected, and she reported the information to the Zhabei Police Station. Deputy Inspector Wu Xiquan and Detective Sun Dafa went and arrested Chen. Subsequently, they also arrested Dong Meimei (25 years old), a dancer from Pudong, and Li Yuanqing, a native of Ningbo, and Ma Shu, a woman from Nanjing. Lin Shuzhen was found at 42 Guofu Men Road in the French Concession. They were all taken to the police station, escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the criminal</p>
<p>session.</p>
<p>Police lawyer Jiang Xian found that Li Yuanqing was not involved and requested his immediate release. The court approved the request. Lawyer Jiang continued, "After Lin Shuzhen eloped, she went to the home of her fellow Shanghai Dance Hall dancer Dong Meimei. In the evening, they went to Dong's home at 5 Zhujia Shed, Haig Road, and stayed together. The next day, they rented a room at the Guotai Flag Hall in the French Concession. That evening, Lin Shuzhen and Chen Weiling slept together and had</p>
<p>physical relations.</p>
<p>Later, Lin was hidden at the home of Ma Shu at 1 Maqi Lane, Maqi Road, until Chen was arrested. Then Lin was moved to Guofu Men Road." The police are now prosecuting Chen, Dong, and Ma under Articles 240, 1 and 3 of the Criminal Law for obstructing family harmony, etc. According to Lin Shuzhen's confession, they decided to elope because of the poor treatment she received from her stepfather and mother, Lin Ma. Now she</p>
<p>does not want to go home</p>
<p>with her mother. The defendants' statements were evasive, and they hired lawyers Fan Gang and He Enliang to defend them. Judge Xiao reviewed the confessions and sentenced Chen Weiling to eight months in prison and Dong Meimei to four months in prison. Ma Shu was found not guilty. Lin Shuzhen is not yet an adult and was ordered to be taken back by her mother, Lin Ma.</p>

<p>Gu Guizhen (39 years old, native of Pudong), a housewife and owner of the Xiangrong Inn at 2 Xizi Laihuo Xing Street in the French Concession, was recently sued by her younger brother, Gu A'bao (owner of the Xinchun Inn at 391 Aiduya Road), who hired a lawyer to accuse his elder sister of false accusation in the Second Special Court. The statement claimed that the plaintiff is a law-abiding innkeeper with no illegal activities. However, the defendant, due to a trivial family matter, harbored resentment after an argument and fabricated facts. She sent a letter to the Molan Police Station, accusing the plaintiff of intimidation and colluding with gangsters to break the defendant's tendons. The police station sent detectives to summon the plaintiff to the police station. After an investigation, the accusations were found to be untrue, and the defendant was reprimanded on record. The defendant, with the intention of causing criminal penalties to others, used such vicious means and committed the crime of false accusation, etc. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Sun Pengham, opened a hearing to examine the case. After questioning both parties, the court ordered the closing of arguments and scheduled the verdict for the 18th of this month.</p>

<p>Sheng Yong, the manager of the Xian Le Dance Hall on Jingan Temple Road, has been working at the hall for many years. However, recently, Xie Baosheng, the manager of Xian Le, discovered that Sheng had embezzled over 300 yuan. He reported the matter to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Ye Yushan to arrest Sheng and escort him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. These details have been reported in this newspaper. The case was postponed. The police investigation found that Sheng had embezzled a total of 1,290.49 yuan. Yesterday morning, the court continued the hearing.

<p>Wang Jinmei, a local woman residing at 46 Meng Shenfu Road, Baxianqiao, previously hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against her concubine, Xue Qiaosheng (51 years old, native of Suzhou), for being lazy, addicted to gambling, and frequently abusive. She requested separation due to intolerable cohabitation. After a final hearing, the court rejected the plaintiff's claim. Because Wang took away her 18-year-old adopted daughter, Yindi, without permission when she left, Xue also hired a lawyer to sue Wang in the civil court of the same court, requesting a judgment ordering cohabitation and the return of the adopted daughter. The statement claimed that the plaintiff had married the defendant as his wife twenty years ago and had an adopted daughter and son, Yindi, 18, and Shigen, 12, respectively, whom they cared for together. Wang Jinmei's attitude changed suddenly recently, and she repeatedly left her husband. On the 27th of last month, she secretly took the adopted daughter with her. An investigation revealed that she had been sold to someone. As this is hearsay, it cannot be confirmed. Moreover, the adopted daughter is of marriageable age, and being outside for a long time is dangerous. Therefore, he requests a judgment ordering the return of the adopted daughter, etc. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Chen, held a hearing in the second court yesterday. The plaintiff arrived with his lawyer and testified as above. He also stated that the defendant is his legal wife. However, according to the defendant's lawyer, the two parties were only cohabiting and not husband and wife. The court, after reviewing the situation, stated that the plaintiff had not applied for mediation and did not comply with legal procedures. Moreover, the previous case had not yet been decided, so it could not be considered that they had already separated. He advised the plaintiff to withdraw the case first. However, the plaintiff insisted on not withdrawing the case, so the court ordered the case to be held for review and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Zhao Laohan (nickname "Little Hubei Laohan," about 30 years old), a gangster from Zhoujiaqiao, west of Shanghai, once served as an inspector in a yarn factory. Most of the workers considered him their boss, and he had some influence in western Shanghai. Since the opening of gambling dens and opium dens after the Shanghai Municipal Council extended the roads beyond the Settlement, each gambling den paid him a monthly fee, and he lived comfortably, frequenting various gambling dens. However, Zhao was obese. The day before yesterday (the 10th), at around 7:00 PM, Zhao, accompanied by his apprentice, nicknamed "Little Dongyang Alin," went to the Dasheng Gambling Den in Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu, to collect his monthly fee. While carrying the money and walking to the entrance of the lane, he suddenly collapsed from a stroke. His apprentice urgently hired a car to rush him to the Red Cross Hospital.

<p>Gu Wenqing, 19 years old, a native of Haimen, lived at 21 Xujiazhai, Da Xi Road, west of Shanghai. Last night, at around 9:00 PM, Gu was walking in front of the New Shen Milk Company on Columbia Road when a public bus with license plate number 5097 came speeding by. Gu was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked down. The wheels ran over his lower body, causing his intestines to spill out. He bled profusely and died at the scene. The nearby Chinese police sent the bus to the Red Cross Hospital. Because it was impossible to save him, the body was sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Residents of Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, Oppose Second Rent Increase; Jianye Company Announces 30% Rent Increase; All Tenants Unanimously Refuse <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Wanyi Lane on Luban Road in the French Concession is the property of the China Jianmei Real Estate Company. The company recently took advantage of the foreign exchange crunch and notified the tenants of Wanyi Lane that the rent would be increased by 30% starting September 1st. The tenants of the lane all expressed their opposition upon hearing the news. The rent in the lane had already been increased by 10% last autumn. In less than a year, it has been increased twice, reaching more than 50% of the original rent. The houses in Wanyi Lane were built as early as 1924 and have nothing to do with the current foreign exchange crunch, nor can the rent increase be justified as a realistic reason. Therefore, the tenants of the lane unanimously refused to increase the rent and jointly wrote to the China Jianye Real Estate Company, requesting that the order be rescinded. They also stated that the tenants' incomes are limited due to the recent rise in prices, and their livelihoods are already difficult. Another rent increase would be difficult to bear. The tenants of other lanes managed by the China Construction Company, such as Huayuan Lane, Renji Lane, and Bugao Lane, have also raised similar objections to the rent increase.</p>

<p>Lu Zhizhi, 28 years old, a native of Huzhou, worked for the French Municipal Council and lived at 4, Lane 1101, Zhiqingfang, Haig Road. His wife, Pan, 23 years old, felt that economic difficulties after the war and the destruction of family property in her hometown made it difficult to live. She committed suicide by swallowing poison at home on the 19th of last month. Medical treatment was ineffective, and she died. After an autopsy, Lu collected her body. Three weeks later, Lu, feeling that life was meaningless, also followed his wife, abandoning his young children. On the 10th, at 2:00 PM, he committed suicide by taking poison at home, hoping to meet his wife in the afterlife. He was discovered and sent to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late. He died an hour later. The police sent the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, Prosecutor Tang Peiyou of the Special Court and forensic doctor Zhang Yan arrived at the office and confirmed that the cause of death was poisoning. His brother, Lu Ruizhi, signed a guarantee to collect the body. His young children are also being cared for by Lu Ruizhi. It is indeed tragic.</p>

<p>Between 2:20 PM and 6:30 PM on the 10th, two assassinations occurred in the Caojiadu area of western Shanghai. The victims were Liu Dianyuan (also known as Liu San, native of Hebei, 43 years old) and Zhang Yuchun (39 years old, native of Jiangbei). Liu was killed at the Fusheng Gambling Den at 6 Dingye Lane, Bailinan Road. He was shot three times, and the fatal wound was a bullet that</p>
<p>penetrated the lung</p>
<p>on his left shoulder. After being injured, he was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He died at 5:15 PM. According to the police investigation, Liu was a *bao tai jiao* (bodyguard) for the Fusheng Gambling Den. Wang Xiumu was previously assassinated, and Wang's gang suspected that Wang was killed by Liu, so they took</p>
<p>revenge</p>
<p>and killed Liu. Zhang Yuchun was killed in Caojiadu, Caojiazai. The killer fired five shots, all hitting the target. He was shot in the head, chest, abdomen, and left hand, and died at the Red Cross Hospital at 9:25 PM. According to the police, the killer of Zhang was a</p>
<p>wealthy young man.</p>
<p>The locations of the two incidents were not within the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Police. Therefore, the police only conducted a brief investigation and sent the two bodies to the coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang Peiyou of the First Special Court and forensic doctor Zhang Yan arrived at the office and confirmed that the deaths were caused by gunshot wounds. They ordered the bodies to be collected.</p>

<p>Fan Peien, a judge of the civil court of the High Court's Third Branch, died of illness at 1:00 PM on the 10th at his residence at 170 Huianfang, Aimei Yu Xian Road. Fan, whose courtesy name was Tongyi, was from Fengjie, Sichuan. He graduated from the National Beiping University of Law and Politics in his early years. In 1930, he passed the judicial officer examination. In 1932, after receiving training at the Judicial Administration Department's Judge Training Institute, he ranked second and was assigned to serve in the court. He has been serving for eight years. He was very knowledgeable in law and handled civil and criminal cases meticulously. He was praised by lawyers and litigants alike. He was also honest and incorruptible and had no private savings. He has been ill for nearly two months. The medical expenses were all borrowed. After his death, his affairs were bleak, and he could not afford a coffin. He left behind orphaned children and a widow, a very tragic situation. The colleagues of the court could not bear to stand by and watch, so they raised funds to handle his funeral. His hard work and integrity as an official are commendable.</p>

<p>In the dilapidated sauce garden house with broken walls in Hongqiaotou, Zhaojia Road, in the city of Nanshi, there are still three houses standing. A group of rogues and poor people went to demolish the houses in order to sell the bricks and tiles at a low price to the controllers and to sell the wood as firewood. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, while they were demolishing the houses, a brick wall collapsed and crushed a man in his thirties to death. When he was pulled out, his head was broken, his brains were flowing, and his hands and feet were crushed. The sight was tragic. Also, at the construction site at the intersection of Minguo Road and Zilai Street, yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a plasterer surnamed Gu, in his thirties, fell from the roof and injured his waist and ribs. He fainted immediately and was sent to the hospital. It is reported that his life is in danger.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Common Sense for Using the Telephone <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a notice to telephone users yesterday, which is valuable. It is published as follows:</p>
<p>Shaking Telephone Wires is Very Harmful</p>
<p>Some telephone users often pull the telephone wire when using the phone, shake it while gesturing, and do not straighten the wire when placing the receiver back in place. Repeated occurrences of this type can easily cause the wires connected to the desk unit to become entangled. In the case of wall-mounted phones, the wire will have several bends. Furthermore, some people often strike the wire against tables or other objects to make a sound. Chinese users are especially prone to holding the receiver in one hand and counting strokes in the air, causing the wire to shake. All of these types of shaking and twisting can loosen the insulating layer of the wire and sometimes damage the inner wires, causing the telephone's connection to the main line to malfunction and even completely disconnect. Some offices use ink from fountain pens to wipe this wire. In fact, after the ink penetrates, it often damages the wire beyond repair, necessitating replacement.</p>
<p>Dial and Receiver Must Be Attended to</p>
<p>Furthermore, when dialing, do not use a sharp pencil instead of your finger. This will cause the markings on the dial to become blurred or fall off, making replacement necessary. When receiving a call, some people, because the person they need is not present, simply place the receiver back on the table or hang it on the wall with force. This is like punching someone in the ear. The delicate mechanics inside the receiver will be damaged as a result, reducing the effectiveness of the service. According to the years of experience of the employees of the Shanghai Telephone Company's repair department, some people often insert pencil tips or matchsticks into the small holes on the telephone receiver. Initially, their motive is only to pass the time, but the result often damages the telephone. Although the telephone is manufactured to be quite sturdy, it is ultimately very delicate.</p>
<p>Wait for the Dial Tone to Be Most Appropriate</p>
<p>When you pick up the receiver and do not hear the dial tone, you may shake the receiver hook on the telephone, thinking that you can shorten the time. However, the effect is the opposite. All you get is unnecessary stimulation and a waste of time. The mechanics of an automatic telephone are not affected by hearing, vision, or other emotional effects. It is better to be patient for a few seconds and wait to hear the dial tone, which is faster.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Sibling-in-Law Sues in Court, Maternal Uncle Testifies, Saying Both Parties Disregard Law and Conscience, Court Orders Defendant Cao Wenyu to Be Released on Original Bail <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Cao Wenyu from Pudong, who used to work at the Japanese company Huili, was asked by the Japanese company to sign contracts with customers in his personal name to facilitate the sales of goods. On March 24th, Cao Wenyu sold 20,000 bags of wheat obtained by the Japanese company in Chuzhou to Cai Xiaoti, the former manager of the Huamei Chenbao newspaper. Cai and Cao are siblings-in-law. Cai paid more than ten thousand yuan as a deposit, but because Cao failed to deliver the goods as agreed, Cai negotiated with Cao, but to no avail. Cai then hired lawyer Xu Jinyu in May of this year to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's civil division, requesting the court to order Cao to return the deposit and pay damages of more than twelve thousand yuan. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court summoned Cao, who presented a document claiming that the wheat sales contract had been terminated on July 9th of last year and that Cai should pay him six hundred yuan. Cai argued that the termination agreement presented by Cao not only lacked witness testimony but was also written by Cao himself, with the seal stolen and the signature forged.</p>
<p>Because Cao had committed forgery, Cai also commissioned the China Gramophone Company on May 25th to record Cao's confession of stealing the seal over the phone and made it into a record as evidence. Recently, Cai hired lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's criminal division, accusing Cao of forgery. The case was investigated by Judge Sun Pengxian. Cao admitted that he wrote the termination agreement himself and signed Cai's name on it without any witnesses. The court ordered Cao to pay one thousand yuan bail to be released pending trial. Yesterday, Judge Sun opened the Sixth Court to hear the case again. The defendant Cao Wenyu, accompanied by his defense lawyer Huang Huijie, and invited</p>
<p>maternal uncle Fu Yougen to court for questioning. Before formally questioning both parties and the witness, the court briefly questioned them and then ordered Cai and Cao to leave the courtroom to question the witness Fu Yougen. According to Fu's testimony, both Cai Xiaoti and Cao Wenyu are his nephews. After they became involved in the lawsuit, he invited them to his home, wrote the six characters "Law, Conscience, Respect for Elders," lit incense and candles, and asked them who was right and who was wrong. As a result, Cai Xiaoti said that Cao Wenyu stole the seal and forged the document, while Cao Wenyu said that the seal on the document was affixed by Cai Xiaoti, and they did not respect the law, conscience, or elders. The court then summoned Cai Xiaoti to the court. According to Cai, he always obeyed his maternal uncle's orders. His maternal uncle hosted a dinner at the Qianlong Hotel to mediate the matter, but unfortunately, it was unsuccessful. The court also briefly questioned witnesses Wang Shiwen and Shen Wenxin. Because the witness from the China Gramophone Company did not arrive, the court announced that the case would be adjourned to August 30th for further hearing. The defendant Cao Wenyu remained released on original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Representing Shanghai <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Min</p>
<p>The so-called "representing Shanghai" means that we express Shanghai through our works.</p>
<p>Some may say: Shanghai has become an "isolated island," what's the point of representing it? The heroic soldiers at the front are charging into battle; they are the ones who should be represented. Indeed, in Shanghai, demons and ghosts, walking corpses, and shamelessness fill the air. All that remains are the sad sighs of some ignorant people. Are we supposed to represent these things?</p>
<p>This is incorrect. First, Shanghai certainly has more than just the aforementioned shameful and tragic phenomena. Although there is depravity and shamelessness on one side, solemn work also undeniably exists on this "isolated island" of Shanghai. Second, if we adopt a correct perspective, that is, a position that does not violate national interests, to choose and analyze our subject matter and then write our works, I think that whether it is shamelessness, heroism, or the sad sighs of the people, it will not harm the true value of the work. We must write about the bright side of the war of resistance, but we must also expose the dark side. However, our exposure should not be mere photography; otherwise, it will become defeatist or treasonous literature. Our exposure must be active within the passive, which means that our literature of exposure corrects certain negative phenomena. At the same time, it educates the masses, allowing them to see in the works how shameful their own sad sighs are, thereby understanding that only by becoming strong and fighting desperately can they eliminate the suffering in their lives.</p>
<p>But have we read such works in the limited newspaper supplements or literary magazines in Shanghai? There are some, but compared to the number of works depicting the war or the wandering lives of people in the interior, they are pitifully few.</p>
<p>There was a collective creation called "Shanghai One Day," which is the only great collection worth mentioning that represents Shanghai. However, it still wrote about the realities of the first year of the war of resistance. The Shanghai of today is different from that of the first year after the war began. The Shanghai of today is even more terrifying than that of the first year after the war.</p>
<p>The "weaponry" of literature and art, I suppose no one opposes it now! Then, representing the Shanghai of today is a hundred or a thousand times more important in the task of literary and artistic work than representing the Shanghai of the first year after the war. The sighs of the so-called ignorant people, we can hear them anytime, anywhere, accompanied by shameless arguments. These sad sighs of the so-called ignorant people are indeed worth paying attention to!</p>
<p>Our literature and art must unleash its "weaponry" to attribute thousands of sins to one target! But this is not enough to simply drag a tail! We must delve into the core of the phenomenon, accurately grasp it, and express it.</p>
<p>We hope that soon, in the newspaper supplements, literary magazines, or the literary sections of general publications, we can see the face of our Shanghai!</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sketch of a Mountain City <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>—War Zone Notes—</p>
<p>The four-hundred-li Long March has finally come to an end. On a night with a bright moon, crossing the wide Shaxi River, we arrived at the foot of Lihuang City. This is the heart of the Dabie Mountains, the former Red Zone, the old home of Chen Shaoyu, and the gunpowder keg before us. Every mountain peak hides infinite power, seemingly saying, "Come on, cruel demons, this is your graveyard!"</p>
<p>Like a long snake, the city wall's battlements gnaw at the floating white clouds. The moon peeks out from the top of the mountain. Bunkers, villages, forests, and everything else are quietly dissolving in the moonlight. "What a beautiful mountain city!" you would surely praise it. But this city, famous in modern history, has not escaped its ancient form despite nearly ten years of time. Narrow streets, low houses, and dilapidated temples are all sufficient to reflect the poverty of society. The lives of the common people are simpler than one could imagine. Corn, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and beans are their main food. Unless they are entertaining guests, fish and meat are unheard of. Clothes are of course even more rudimentary. Not only has silk never graced this place, but even foreign cloth is extremely rare. Such congenital poverty is already enough to amaze us, but before the war of resistance broke out, they were also subjected to political exploitation, such as an exorbitant one yuan per catty of edible salt.</p>
<p>Now, the war of resistance has revived the life of the mountain city. The common people can breathe again. General Li Zongren is using the methods of governing Guangxi to support this base in the Dabie Mountains. First, he eliminated unreasonable taxes and solved the serious problem of edible salt supply. He established a tea loan office in Mabao, providing interest-free loans to tea farmers. At the same time, he mobilized all the village work teams to go to the villages to conduct field surveys of agricultural production and technology in order to stabilize the economic foundation of this mountain city, transforming the people with "faces as pale as vegetables" into a strong army, rising up together to participate in this sacred task of defending western Anhui.</p>
<p>"Success depends on human effort," Construction Director Cai Gongwang often says. Indeed, the difficulties of the mountain city are gradually being overcome. When we passed through Minzu Street and left the East Gate the next morning, the shopkeepers were smiling, greeting customers who were buying goods. This was not the boom caused by the war because those surrounding the shops were all the locals.</p>
<p>In short, everything the mountain city needs has been fully prepared!</p>
<h3 id="e80">Doubt <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ku</p>
<p>I think a lot, but doubts are constantly rippling in my heart. Most things in the universe are unfamiliar to me, but I think they are beautiful and magnificent. I like to get close to them, get to know them, and become familiar with them, but doubts are always hindering me.</p>
<p>The things I understand seem so insignificant that they can only be described as "a grain of sand in the ocean." I am a person, but I have no power to know the truth of life.</p>
<p>Every day I hear the prayers of God's faithful followers, and question marks jump in my mind. Someone tells me that this is also a kind of life, but I am at a loss. Can life be prayed for?</p>
<p>I also asked why I am afraid to talk about the dead. But the answer I got was... it's for the sake of life. What an illusion, I still don't understand.</p>
<p>Unanswered questions entangle me. Although I am constantly searching, there is no end in sight. Some are illusory,</p>
<p>bitter and vague, which makes me annoyed.</p>
<p>In life, doubts are like a constant stream of water, never stopping.</p>
<p>I have no way to answer these countless riddles one by one (these extremely complex problems can never be solved). I want to use the one or two pieces of truth I have discovered to illuminate my doubts!</p>
<p>Maybe these things hiding in the smoke can be revealed in detail...</p>
<p>Me: On the journey of life, there is no need to pay attention to those trivial things. Just recognize the goal of progress and fight against all obstacles, including sorrow, hesitation, and concession...</p>
<p>I am now asking myself again, "Like this, do I still have doubts about life?"</p>

<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Graduation</p>
<p>We, thirty-eight people, moved from the classroom to the restaurant. Pots of pale yellow loquats were placed on the table. People held their secrets, sadness, and joy. Who could resist that moment of heartbeat?</p>
<p>Gradually it changed.</p>
<p>Laughter, shouts, toasts, and the clinking of glasses were deafening, as if they were going to blow the roof off. After laughing, after getting drunk, enjoy it to the fullest. In that moment, people wanted to forget everything, themselves, and the times.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was with joy or sorrow, but the only thing I was sure of was that, with a bit of drunkenness, people returned home.</p>
<p>Would the cool night breeze wake everyone's minds? Have they ever thought: Where to go after graduation?</p>

<h3 id="e84">Haiku <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Chen</p>
<p>During a trip, I met a Japanese military policeman. He asked me to exchange something as a souvenir, so I was forced to draw a quick sketch for him. This made him very happy, and he reciprocated with something as well. It was this "Haiku."</p>
<p>"These are the posthumous works of a deceased friend. The author was a handsome man, a talented young man. In the autumn of 1937, he was sent to the front line on the mainland and participated in many major and minor battles. These haiku were sent to me while he was recuperating after being injured. The first one was written during the Battle of Xuzhou, the second one on a certain highland in Shanxi, and the third one I think was written in some field hospital.</p>
<p>"In short, he was a good man, a melancholic child. In fact, when he first set foot on the mainland, he seemed to have foreseen that there was no hope of returning alive..."</p>
<p>The military policeman explained in a nostalgic and sentimental tone. I am now translating it, hoping that everyone can also smell a bit of melancholy in this haiku. This smell is like the product of a relatively candid poet's emotions emanating from the dim entity of the "Yamato" Empire.</p>
<p>1.  On the Battlefield</p>
<p>The thunder of field guns,</p>
<p>Shattered the ominous black clouds above my head.</p>
<p>Night, with the wings of dark death,</p>
<p>Covers the ghostly ranks.</p>
<p>We have lost our reason and our senses,</p>
<p>Just climbing towards the bottomless darkness.</p>
<p>Ask,</p>
<p>What am I looking for!</p>
<p>2.  "Punitive Expedition" in Shanxi</p>
<p>We are looking for the enemy,</p>
<p>Because we hope for a decisive battle,</p>
<p>In battle, this gamble of life,</p>
<p>I can get rid of the burden of memory.</p>
<p>Climbing over mountains, crossing deep valleys,</p>
<p>No clouds, no shade,</p>
<p>Nor the shadow of the enemy.</p>
<p>In what mysterious crack are they</p>
<p>Laughing, peeking,——</p>
<p>At me, a Quixotic warrior?</p>
<p>In the lonely mountain recesses,</p>
<p>I bear again the unfortunate loneliness and memory!</p>
<p>3.  Owl</p>
<p>When I am most unhappy,</p>
<p>Also at this kind of dim, moonlit dusk,</p>
<p>It always flies to the tree in my house,</p>
<p>Like a priest in a black cassock praying for the dead.</p>
<p>Owl, my lover,</p>
<p>You crossed the Yellow Sea, flew over the battlefields,</p>
<p>Like a pair of will-o'-the-wisps,</p>
<p>Your eerie eyes</p>
<p>Again illuminate the window of this field hospital.</p>
<p>Owl, Schadenfreude friend,</p>
<p>What are you playing for me?</p>
<p>Is it a prayer or a dirge?</p>
<p>But I'm not dead yet.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Shanghai Does Not Show Foreign Films, Domestic Films Can Finally Show Their Worth <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— (Hua Zhi)</p>
<p>American film merchants, who are always keen on business opportunities, are rumored to have recently had a sudden impulse to "stop sending new films to China." China has always been their good customer, so why do they have such an idea? It is said that because of the tight foreign exchange and the low value of the legal currency, the income from showing new films in Shanghai and other places is not enough to cover expenses, so they have to stop shipping new blockbusters to the Far East. The first to propose this idea was Mr. Tailu Bader, the Far East agent of 20th Century Fox, one of the five major film companies in Hollywood. At the end of last month, he presented the reasons to the major American film tycoons, roughly saying that after the value of Chinese legal currency fell against foreign currencies, business in Shanghai and other places was sluggish. In addition, with changes in customs duties and increased population taxes, American film merchants really have no profit to make. It is better for everyone to stop shipping new films there. The tycoons have different opinions on this proposal. Most believe that the low price of Chinese legal currency is a temporary phenomenon, and Fox's productions may be more expensive than other companies, and the environment is also different. What is worrying is that European countries and the Far East, such as India, are already automatically rejecting American films. Abandoning the Chinese market again is tantamount to suicide. However, the general cinemas in Shanghai that specialize in showing foreign films are not without trepidation about this move. Fortunately, some cinemas take a summer break, and some show old copies or second-rate films. Therefore, there are no blockbusters being shown, and there may be a proper solution when it cools down in the autumn. Those who care about film affairs believe that if Hollywood really stops supplying new films, a group of modern movie fans in Shanghai will be disappointed and angry. However, some are determined that not showing foreign films does not necessarily mean that cinemas will close down. On the contrary, domestic films can finally show their worth, which is the same reason why the import of foreign goods has plummeted.</p>

<p>— Notes by Leng Fang</p>
<p>Entering the Film Industry</p>
<p>Although I had long imagined a film career, I didn't have any active ambitions at first because I was still young. Four years ago, while working at the Mass Education Center, director Su Yi, whom I had met through an introduction, suddenly came to the province from Hong Kong to invite me to star in a film called "New Youth" for Global Company. At that time, I had no self-confidence and felt hesitant and scared, so I didn't dare to rashly agree. Later, after Mr. Su repeatedly urged me, I asked the center for a month's leave to try it out in Hong Kong. This was the beginning of my entry into the film industry.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract</p>
<p>It's quite laughable to say: when I ran to the set at that time, it was the first time I had seen such a scene. I looked at it very strangely and didn't understand anything, just like a country person going to the city. But in trying to shoot, I was very daring under unusual excitement and not timid at all. After "New Youth" was filmed, I was about to go back to cancel my leave and work when another company, Daguan, insisted on signing a long contract with me for several films. Having tasted the flavor of this for the first time, I had a considerable grasp and was very interested. Therefore, I returned to the province to resign from my original job and began to devote myself to film work. In the past three years, I have filmed more than thirty films such as "The World Is For All" and "Cuiheng Village." In terms of acting skills, I have nothing good to say. There is only one thing: I have never acted in films that are too meaningless, which I find quite gratifying.</p>
<p>Favorite Peking Opera</p>
<p>In addition to filming, diligently studying English, learning to sing, dance, and play the piano are my daily lessons. I used to have a deeper love for Peking Opera. At that time, there was a "Su She" in Guangzhou, which was a large-scale organization where gentlemen gathered to study various subjects. I practiced Peking Opera in the entertainment department of the club for a long time. Plays such as "Qijie," "Tanmu," "Jiapo," and "Toujunbiejiao" have all been performed haphazardly on stage. Fortunately, I can cope with acting in Mandarin films in Shanghai. It is all because when I practiced Peking Opera, I heard them speak Mandarin often and learned some by studying it diligently.</p>
<p>Dance World Shadows (35)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Seventh Star: Han Lumei <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>People say Han Lumei is a stone lion, I didn't believe it. Later, I understood, and I believed it. I told people Han Lumei was a stone lion, and they didn't believe it either. The reason they didn't believe it was the same as before I understood, because Lumei's figure can be described as having slender shoulders and a slim waist, standing gracefully and elegantly. Furthermore, her eloquence can be considered witty and tireless, which is the opposite of the qualities of a stone lion. No wonder people didn't believe it. It turns out that the stone lion people were comparing Han Lumei to was not an ordinary stone lion, but the stone lions in the Ningguo Mansion in the Dream of the Red Chamber. Someone said, "In the Ningguo Mansion, probably only a pair of stone lions are clean," and that's when I understood. But I still didn't believe it completely. Later, after talking with Lumei for a few minutes and hearing Lumei's fellow sisters talk about her a few times, I began to believe it somewhat.</p>
<p>Lumei said, "She is nineteen years old this year and attended high school but didn't graduate. Indeed, her Chinese and English writing are both good, and she can speak some English reasonably well." Ordinary dance hostesses mostly divide dance patrons into three classes. The first class is the "household," whom they must especially flatter, but whose expenses are also especially large. The second class is the "guests," whose attitude toward them is usually "those who come are not refused, and those who leave are not stopped." Guests casually buy a few dance tickets, and the hostesses casually dance a few songs. There is also a third class, the "trailer," which is a long story; please refer to my "Dragon Head and Trailer." Writing this, I suddenly remembered a story: "Once upon a time, there was a schoolteacher who saw that the landlord's garden was full of eggplants, but they were never cooked for him to eat. So he learned from the story of the ancient people who plucked their swords and composed two satirical poems—'The garden is full of eggplants, colorful and bright, yet the teacher is not offered a single meal.' The landlord saw it, because eggplants were not rare, and since the teacher wanted to eat them, he ordered the kitchen to provide them. From then on, eggplants were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, making the teacher sick of them. He thought it was his own request, so he couldn't go back on his word and had to write two more poems—'I didn't expect to eat eggplants all the time; it's easy to invite eggplants, but hard to send them away.' Ordinary guests probably want to taste the feeling of being a 'trailer,' but remember my story of 'it's easy to invite eggplants, but hard to send them away.'" Lumei said, "She doesn't have a 'trailer,' and she treats 'households' and 'guests' equally, without any discrimination. However, a single dance is a single dance, sitting at the table is sitting at the table, and buying tickets to go out is buying tickets to go out. If you spend more money, she will never let you waste it."</p>
<p>Lumei's business can be said to be good. According to her, this is all due to her ability to talk, her wit, and her humor. I think that may not be the whole story. First, most of the current dance hostesses have "trailers," and sometimes when the "trailer" is there, it's inevitable that they don't focus on the guests. Second, Lumei did study at high school, and her knowledge is still a bit higher than those who are barely literate. It's more interesting for guests to invite her to sit and chat. In addition, she dances well and has a very pretty appearance, so people are naturally happy to associate with her.</p>

<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Zheng Zibao, the owner of Shanghai's Gengxin Stage and the Great Plum Blossom Hall, and Du Juchu, the father of Du Liyun, departed from Shanghai, carrying thirteen letters of invitation to Peking, and arrived in Peking a few days ago to proceed separately. Those who have been secured include female performers Zhao Xiaolan and Wu Suqiu to open the show. The first performance will feature Xun Huisheng. Li Wanchun, who recently returned to Peking, is also in the process of being booked.</p>
<p>The veteran actor Yan Lanqiu (Nine Gales) has been ill for many days, with his condition fluctuating. He has not yet recovered. Recently, his condition has worsened again, and he is in critical condition. His family has already prepared for his funeral. His nephew, Yan Shishan, recently returned to Peking from Shanghai with acclaim. After a brief rest, he will join various troupes. It is said that Shishan is engaged to the daughter of the musician Zhang Jiu, and there is talk of a wedding within the next month.</p>
<p>The famous martial artist Li Wanchun has been attracting audiences by staging new plays and has achieved considerable success. Recently, after "Eighteen Arhats subdue the Garuda," he will stage another Buddhist drama. It is said that the play has been titled "Buddha-Heart Emperor," which tells the story of Emperor Liang Wu. It will also be presented in a new way by the disciples of the Arhats. Compared to "Eighteen Arhats subdue the Garuda," it promises to be even more dazzling. Once it premieres, it will surely be a hit.</p>
<p>Previously, there were rumors in Peking that the famous red net performer Lin Shusen had decided to go north, but it is now said that he suddenly canceled his original plan. Because Lin has considerable relationships with Li Hongchun, Li Wanchun, and others, he is unwilling to create a three-way rivalry, so the plan to go north has been completely abandoned.</p>
<p>It is true that the Shanghai Golden Theatre has invited the martial artist Sun Yukun, but it is proceeding separately from Song Dezhu. It is currently undecided whether they will go to Shanghai together and perform in the same troupe. At the same time, influential figures in Peking have also recommended Sun Yukun to the Golden Theatre, and there may be hope of success.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>General Long-Legs' Hall Meeting, Hanging Plaques, and Slashing</p>
<p>As for the tricks he played on Zhang Shouzhong, they made Long-Legs look bad, almost angering him to death. Helplessly, he could only take the longevity plaque that he had given and slash it wildly with a knife, cursing and swearing to vent his anger. This shows Chen's disregard for credibility and seems to be a loss in terms of friendship. Before Zhang's mother's birthday, Chen had sent a very valuable birthday gift through a special envoy. At the same time, he also made a very large golden longevity plaque. On the eighth day of the month, he personally came to Xu to celebrate her birthday, which was remarkably warmer than when the governors of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan provinces only sent representatives to Xu. Long-Legs was naturally very grateful to see him so solemn, and he ordered his attendants to hang Chen's plaque high in the center of the birthday hall. Xuexuan also tried to stop him, saying that we brothers are all family, and we would never dare to be so presumptuous. In fact, Zhang and Chen did have a long-standing friendship. When Leng Yuqiu was stationed in Xu as the commander of the Third Division in the second year of the Republic of China, Zhang served as the commander of the Restoration Army Corps, and Chen served as the commander of the 74th Mixed Brigade, all under the command of Leng. They were all old colleagues, so what Xuexuan said was not entirely unfounded. However, Zhang Xiaokun was a righteous and passionate friend. He believed that since Chen could honor a military commander's defense zone with the prominent status of a governor, he certainly thought highly of himself. As the saying goes, "If you respect me one foot, I will respect you ten feet." Therefore, the result was that Chen's plaque was hung in the center. When the two of them started talking, they were very compatible and became even closer. On that day, they became sworn brothers, and they always sat together when watching plays and eating, and they were very intimate. —(80)</p>

<h3 id="e90">Finance: The Gold Rush Expands, Creating Unprecedented High Prices – 4,820 Yuan – Unexpectedly, the News of the Japanese Cabinet's Resignation Arrives, and the Bulls Change Their Style, Causing a Sudden Reaction <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for cash gold (Sia Sek) was extremely chaotic. First, it surged violently, then continued to reach unprecedented new highs, with successive peaks seen, soaring from 4,400 yuan to 4,800 yuan, breaking through five 100-yuan barriers, suddenly reaching a peak price of 4,820 yuan, a sharp increase of 470 yuan. This was due to the continuous and unstoppable sharp contraction of foreign exchange rates in both the official and unofficial markets, coupled with a certain bank's aggressive buying on behalf of non-professionals, as well as securities firms and Hong Kong firms competing to absorb gold. In the afternoon, rumors also circulated that treasury bills were about to be issued, causing many to be unwilling to easily sell. Later, news suddenly broke of the resignation of the Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet, which stabilized foreign exchange rates. Large buyers suddenly became hesitant, and many retail investors rushed to sell, causing the price to plummet from its daily peak to 4,670 yuan at closing. However, the result was still a huge surge of 320 yuan compared to the previous day. However, according to the closing prices of foreign exchange rates in the evening, the gap widened further, with British gold at 5,453.70 yuan and US exchange at 5,546.80 yuan, still a sharp premium of over 800 yuan. It was rumored that the gold price in the afternoon had fallen to 4,540 yuan and it was difficult to find buyers. Trading was brisk, reaching 1,000 taels. Gold jewelry prices initially rose by 45 yuan, with Da Tong Hang seeing an unprecedented peak of 485 yuan, but later fell back by 15 yuan, ultimately closing up 30 yuan. Customs gold remained flat, while Sino-British pure gold suddenly rose again.</p>
<p>Sia Sek Rises Another 320 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the opening price per bar (ten taels) was raised by 150 yuan due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange rates and increased market confidence. A certain bank, acting on behalf of a wealthy merchant, exchanged 50 taels at a price of 4,500 yuan. Securities firms emerged to cover short positions on behalf of clients, while Jin Hao and a certain bank (acting on behalf of non-professionals) jointly sold dozens of taels, briefly pushing the price down to 4,460 yuan. Later, a certain bank and money changers competed to absorb gold, causing a sharp rise of 90 yuan. The money changers acquired ten taels from a jewelry firm for 4,550 yuan. Later, a certain Jin Hao, acting on behalf of speculators, came to sell, suddenly pushing the price down by 50 yuan. A certain Jin Hao sold ten taels to the money changers at a price of 4,500 yuan. Subsequently, foreign exchange rates tightened again, and a certain bank resumed buying, while securities firms also stopped selling and started buying, causing the market to move straight towards a higher peak, surging another 120 yuan. The money changers acquired 30 taels from a jewelry firm at a price of 4,620 yuan. Later, the jewelry firm sold ten taels to a certain bank at 4,615 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. The opening price in the afternoon was 15 yuan higher. The money changers traded ten taels among themselves at a price of 4,630 yuan. Later, rumors suddenly spread that the Ministry of Finance was about to issue treasury bills, and the underlying pressure on foreign exchange rates was quite tight, so those interested in buying were even more reluctant to sell. A certain bank (acting on behalf of non-professionals) and securities firms competed to buy aggressively, and a certain jewelry firm also absorbed some gold on behalf of Hong Kong firms, making the surge even more dramatic, soaring another 190 yuan. The money changers acquired 30 taels from a certain Jin Hao at a price of 4,810 yuan, an unprecedented new high. At that moment, news broke that the Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet had collapsed, and foreign exchange rates began to stabilize, causing market confidence to falter. The money changers suddenly turned to selling, and jewelry firms and retail investors emerged to aggressively sell, causing a sharp decline of 150 yuan. The money changers sold 20 taels to a certain Jin Hao at a price of 4,670 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening. As a result, there was a sharp increase of 320 yuan compared to the previous day. The price has risen for seven consecutive days, totaling 1,070 yuan, with a daily fluctuation of 360 yuan. The current price of cash gold is 10 yuan higher than the Sia Sek gold, while the current standard gold is 65 yuan lower than the Sia Sek gold, but there are few reports of transactions.</p>
<p>New Jewelry Gold Price at 485 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial asking price for gold jewelry at Da Tong Hang was 440 yuan per tael. At 9:30, it was raised by 10 yuan, then by another 5 yuan shortly after, then by another 5 yuan at 10:15, and again by another 5 yuan at 11:30. At 2:30 in the afternoon, it was raised by 10 yuan, then by another 5 yuan ten minutes later, and again by 5 yuan at 3:00. At that time, Da Tong Hang's price of 485 yuan was the highest price since the market began. At 4:10, it fell back by 15 yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, it closed up 30 yuan, with Da Tong Hang revising its price to 470 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang to 468 yuan. There was no fixed price for buying in.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Both Rise</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 10th stated that British pure gold rose again to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce, causing the People's Bank of China's cash buying price to rise to 1,212.6 yuan. The posted Customs gold price remained flat at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 3 jiao to 1,207 yuan, 9 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Foreign Exchange Rates in Both Official and Unofficial Markets Contract Sharply Again <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's official exchange rates were announced, with the British exchange rate contracting sharply by 25 and the US exchange rate plummeting by half a yuan, creating unprecedentedly tight prices of 3 shillings and 25 and 6 yuan and 3125. The rest all fell miserably. The unofficial market for British and American exchanges still had amazing changes and an extremely chaotic state, but the pressure was increasing. The opening price for British gold was 3 shillings and 59375, and for US exchange it was 7 yuan, but because those outside the market were unwilling to offer higher prices, it was a market with prices but no trading. Around 9:15, the market tightened to 3 shillings and 375 for British gold and 6 yuan and 5625 for US exchange because the Japanese bank, Hong Kong speculators, and Sassoon all wanted to get ahead. Afterwards, the buying frenzy subsided slightly, and Chinese banks and a certain American bank were willing to sell, causing the market to briefly rebound to 3 shillings and 4375 for British gold and 6 yuan and 6875 for US exchange. After 11:30, the buying frenzy reignited, and the closing price for British gold was only 3 shillings and 34375, and for US exchange it was only 6 yuan and a half. In the afternoon, because there were rumors in the market that treasury bills would be issued, the Japanese bank, Chinese and Western speculators, and others spared no effort to buy. As those outside the market were unwilling to offer prices at the beginning, the situation was once again a market with prices but no trading. After 1:15, buyers absorbed gold regardless of price, making the situation even tighter, with British gold once shouting over 3 shillings and 1875 and US exchange also calling over 6 yuan and 875, both unprecedentedly tight prices. Later, news suddenly broke of the Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet's resignation, causing the buying frenzy to subside. In addition, Hong Kong banks sent cables to sell, so the underlying trend gradually stabilized. The result was a closing price of 3 shillings and 25 for British gold and 6 yuan and 325 for US exchange. It was heard that after closing, the British rate rebounded to 3 shillings and 18125 and the US exchange to 6 yuan and 375. The futures for this month also followed suit, ultimately tightening by 32825 for British gold and weakening by 65625 for US exchange. Trading was quite brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sassoon and Japanese Traders' Buying Continues Unabated</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate showed a rise of 125 for the near term and a rise of 025 for the far term. The price of silver in New York remained flat. The price of gold in London rebounded by half a pence. Foreign exchange rates for British gold versus American dollars and versus French francs remained flat, while the exchange rate versus Shanghai contracted by 1875. American dollars versus British gold and versus French francs were flat, while the exchange rate versus Shanghai continued to contract slightly by 3 jiao. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. At the opening of the banks in the morning, the spot price was called at 3 shillings and 59375 for British gold and 7 yuan for US exchange, but no sales were reported, resulting in a market with prices but no trading. Compared to the previous closing price, there was no increase or decrease. After the opening, the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank, Western firm Sassoon, and Hong Kong Telegraph Company came to buy, and foreign firms also made some settlements. In addition, HSBC only had an appetite to buy and was unwilling to sell. Although a certain foreign bank and many Chinese banks came out with bullish positions, a certain Chinese bank continued to buy aggressively, so the demand for funds ultimately exceeded supply, causing the market to push towards new tight prices. HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 3 shillings and a half with profit. Later, the Japanese bank, Sassoon, and Hong Kong Telegraph Company successively bought spot British gold at 3 shillings and 4375 and 40625 from a certain bank and a Chinese bank, as well as spot US exchange at 6 yuan and 625 and 5625. When HSBC's posted exchange rates were announced, British gold contracted by 25, and US exchange contracted slightly by half a yuan. Other rates also fell accordingly. When the silver balance tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, Chinese banks traded spot British gold among themselves at 3 shillings and 40625. Later, the Japanese bank settled spot British gold at 3 shillings and 375 with the Sino-Belgian Bank. Because the buying frenzy subsided slightly and Chinese banks continued to sell, the underlying trend turned stronger. Foreign banks such as HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 3 shillings and 40625 and 4375 from Chinese banks and a certain bank, as well as spot US exchange at 6 yuan and 625 and 6875. After 11:30, the buying frenzy resumed, and sellers became scarce, so the situation became tighter, but trading was sparse. Extended to the afternoon closing, the current spot selling price for British gold was only 3 shillings and 34375, and for US exchange it was only 6 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The closing price rebounded after falling again.</p>
<p>The situation was chaotic at the initial opening in the afternoon. The market suddenly heard news that gold treasury bills would be issued, so Chinese banks were unwilling to sell. In addition, the Japanese bank, Hong Kong speculators, and Western firm Sassoon all came to buy, and foreign firms were also unwilling to supply, so there were few reports of transactions. Only after 2:15 was trading heard to begin, with a certain bank and a foreign firm selling spot British gold at 3 shillings and 25 to Sassoon, as well as spot US exchange at 6 yuan and 3125. Later, the softest price for British gold shouted over 3 shillings and 1875, and the tightest price for US exchange also called over 6 yuan and 1875, so the underlying trend became tighter. Later, news broke that the Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet had collapsed, and Hong Kong banks sent cables to sell, so the underlying trend eased. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price for British gold had rebounded to 3 shillings and 25, and US exchange had also eased to 6 yuan and 3125. The British gold rate for this month was 3 shillings and 171875, and the US exchange rate was 6 yuan and 15625. (It was heard that after closing, HSBC sold spot British gold at 3 shillings and 18125 to a foreign firm. At the same time, it was also heard that US exchange had tightened to 6 yuan and 375.) As a result, spot British gold tightened again by 34375 compared to the previous day, and US exchange continued to soften by 6875. The British rate for this month tightened by 328125, and the US rate rose by 65625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange at 450 Yuan</p>

<h3 id="e92">Foreign Currencies Are Treated as Precious Items; The Market Retracts and Declines <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the weakness of foreign exchange rates and the sharp rise in Sia Sek, British and American gold pounds surged by 45 yuan. British and American notes were in high demand and extremely strong. British gold notes rose by 72 yuan, and American gold notes rose by 15 yuan and 8 jiao. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes were both in high demand, while Singapore notes and Dutch notes all tended to rise sharply. Italian notes and German gold notes, which are usually rarely considered, also rose sharply. All foreign currencies were treated as precious items. Japanese notes were strong at first and then weakened, ultimately remaining at 1 yuan and 9 fen. The demand for Korean notes increased, and the supply was scarce, making the market firm and brisk. The evening market price was 9 jiao and 4 fen. After the closing, rumors of the Japanese cabinet's collapse were rampant, and foreign currencies became weaker due to Sia Sek sellers covering their positions. Sichuan Road money changers only sold and did not buy. American notes were sold for 15 yuan and 5 jiao. No trades were made in the association market. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds rose by 5 yuan, British gold notes rose by 5 yuan and 5 jiao, American gold pounds rose by 4 yuan, American gold notes rose by 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 8 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 2 jiao and 9 fen, French franc notes rose by 2 fen, Singapore notes and Dutch notes both rose by 4 jiao, Annam notes rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen, Robi notes rose by 1 jiao, Canadian notes rose by 1 yuan and 2 jiao, Philippine notes rose by 5 jiao, Italian notes rose by 5 fen, German gold notes rose by 1 jiao, Australian gold notes rose by 5 yuan, and Siamese notes rose by 4 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Securities: Inner Spring Clouds Suddenly Unfold; Class C Reaches 40 Yuan <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for securities in the unofficial market: the market began to retract and gradually showed signs of light. Gold rose sharply, foreign exchange rates contracted again, and the stock market actually rose by about 1 or 2 yuan. Those who previously held the erroneous view that gold was expensive and bonds were cheap were now unable to justify themselves. Rumors circulated in the market that Japanese Prime Minister Arita had resigned and the cabinet had collapsed. Reports stated that there was a loan agreement between China and the United States, with a large amount involved, which was somewhat suspicious, but it led to short covering and turning long, and many people were involved. After even the Little Sixth Day, there was finally a slight turning point. Untying the bell requires the same hand that tied it. Class C stocks broke through the 40 yuan mark, and Class E stocks also broke through the 50 yuan mark after the closing, showing signs of inner spring clouds suddenly unfolding. Yesterday's progress showed no highs or lows. Although there was still pressure, it was already covered by the bullish atmosphere, and the shorts turned from selling to buying. In an instant, they broke through the 40 yuan mark. On the buying side, No. 25 and Tongkang were in high demand, and Hengfu and Lianyi also absorbed a considerable amount. Retail investors covering their shorts were particularly active. On the selling side, only No. 8, Lianhe, and Yongkang were numerous, with the rest being scattered in small quantities. As a result, market prices rebounded by 2.5 to 9 jiao, and the unofficial market rebounded by about 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 500,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of Guohua Bank were traded at a price of 39 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The Public Industries Association reported that foreign exchange rates are gradually contracting, and the actual shares and rubber shares of slightly reputable companies are very firm. Therefore, the stock market was unusually active in the afternoon, and trading was also brisk, but the time was too short and could not be completed in one go. Investors are now watching the gradual contraction of foreign exchange rates, and their intentions seem to have turned to the local stock market. A comparison of the daily highs and lows of several stock prices is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Yarn and Cotton: The Ministry Orders the Prohibition of Speculation; Cotton Yarn Stops Business; Yesterday's Market Saw an Unusually Chaotic Situation with Surges and Then Declines <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then declined, with the situation remaining as chaotic as ever, and speculators' minds were also confused. They gathered in the marketplace all day long, with as many people going in and out as there are hairs on an ox. Therefore, market prices advanced and retreated rapidly, fluctuating unpredictably. It has been found that the actual demand has only been from Hong Kong buyers, with little trading from other sources. Transactions among industry peers accounted for more than half, and buyers were all piling up goods in warehouses. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn jumped to 740 yuan, and everyone shouted that they couldn't buy it. Warehouse receipts jumped to 700 yuan. However, due to bad news, the market was closed from the 12th onwards, which was like a bolt from the blue for most operators. They had the difficulty of not being able to sell spot Double Horse yarn at 710 yuan or warehouse receipts at 670 yuan. It is said that trading in the unofficial market reached 655 yuan. However, in the afternoon, Double Horse yarn warehouse receipts rebounded to 690 yuan.</p>
<p>The market situation for current yarn at the morning opening was still peaceful. The opening price for 20-count Bianma Yang machine yarn remained unchanged at 690 yuan, and the opening prices for spot goods in outside warehouses were not maintained. After a short while, a disturbance suddenly arose, saying that the exchange rate had contracted by 25, and speculators were once again as if drunk. Brokers' shouts were revived, and buyers came like a tide. 20-count Double Horse yarn warehouse receipts jumped by 10 yuan to 700 yuan, but the price of spot goods in outside warehouses increased even more strongly, jumping by 18 yuan to 740 yuan. The price sometimes expanded and sometimes contracted until the closing. It was heard that the market would stop gathering from tomorrow onwards, and there were various rumors, and selling pressure followed. 20-count Double Horse yarn fell back by 10 yuan, and warehouse receipts plummeted by 10 yuan. It was found that the statistical total for half a day was 1,865 bales, with the market price increasing by 8 yuan for 20-count yarn and warehouse receipts falling by 10 yuan. Today, 17 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai and 200 pieces to Tianjin. A list of the amounts purchased by each source is shown on the left.</p>
<p>Industry peers: 1,030, Hong Kong: 580, Mainland: 105, Yunnan: 150, Total: 1,030</p>
<p>Yesterday, after 11:00, the yarn industry association suddenly posted on the blackboard that business would be temporarily suspended from the 12th due to the hot weather. According to the market, this was because the Ministry of Economic Affairs had issued an order to stop buying and selling, fearing that another venue would be organized.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Cotton Price Rises by Six or Seven Yuan; Trading Relatively Narrow <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The trading of both domestic and foreign cotton has become sluggish, with few transactions. This is because the price increases have been too rampant, causing onlookers to remain hesitant. Only the Xin Yu and Hong Zhang yarn factories purchased 750 bales of Indian cotton. Other manufacturers' purchases were particularly narrow. However, business among peers is still not weak. Domestic and American cotton, in bales of high quality, reached a peak price of 140 yuan in cash. The prices for various types of cotton rose another six or seven yuan. Supplies from northern Jiangsu have not yet arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has seen tightening exchange rates in recent days, causing foreign cotton prices to soar. Domestic and foreign manufacturers have become more relaxed about purchasing raw cotton. Yesterday, White Rock cotton even demanded a new high price of 150 yuan, and Houston cotton demanded 160 yuan. This selling price is increasingly approaching the market price offered by foreign firms.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton market prices, New York experienced a slight weakness yesterday. Initially, due to the slump in stock prices and selling by Liverpool interests in the market, the market price fluctuated. Later, although there was some trading among peers, no improvement was seen. As a result, closing prices fell by two to three British pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by twenty-five rupees. Egyptian cotton fell by more than ten British pounds.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Piece Goods Still Expected to Rise; It is Heard That the Eastern Piece Goods and White Goods Market Will Suspend Trading Starting Today <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Selling prices continue to rise uniformly. Yih Ho 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth has risen another fifty cents per piece. It has been verified that it has risen by a considerable three yuan in recent days. Sixteen-pound Geng Yu coarse twill has risen a total of two and a half yuan. Light-pound coarse cloth has risen by about one and a half yuan. Fine cloth and fine twill have risen by about two yuan. Yesterday, the market price rose again by twenty to fifty cents per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth is bought and sold through various middlemen, causing market confusion, with a definite rise of about fifty cents. Most people expect prices to rise, so both peers and hoarders have very active business minds. More than 400 pieces of white and colored goods were transacted. Guangdong dealers handled more than 100 boxes of plain-colored, navy blue twill, broadcloth, and serge. Hong Kong dealers handled 50-60 bales of fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan dealers handled 50-60 boxes of colored cloth and colored twill. Nanyang dealers handled more than 2,000 pieces of bleached and dyed twill, fine cloth, and summer goods.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: Yesterday, fine cloth and fine twill initially fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, with the trend remaining firm. This is because Japanese firms are not only not selling, claiming to have no stock, but are also buying. For example, Abe &amp; Co. bought 100 bales of Dragon Head fine cloth for delivery next month, at a price of 19.8 yuan per piece. Ito bought several dozen bales of Dragon Head spot goods, offering 18.8 to 18.9 yuan. Therefore, the market atmosphere was tight in the afternoon. Although there were no transactions from out-of-town dealers, 500-600 pieces were continuously transacted on the street. It is also heard that the white goods market has decided to follow the example of the yarn market and suspend trading, starting today (the 12th).</p>
<p>Exports: 115 pieces were shipped to Tianjin on the 12th, and 25 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Grains: Rice in Panic; Ke Jian Should Be Sold <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Du Geng variety from the lower reaches of the river, together with the Songjiang gang's 23rd shipment, included 1,300-1,400 packages of Che Lun Bao Zi rice. Sales of all kinds of rice have been unusually crowded in the market recently, and most have already been sold out, so purchases are urgent. Out-of-town merchants report that old stocks in various inland regions are depleted, and there is a lack of goods to transport. However, warehouses in Shanghai still have more than 20,000 packages of white japonica rice and 70,000-80,000 packages of indica rice. According to rice merchants, it will still take some time for the new Western japonica rice to come on the market, so there may be a shortage of japonica rice. However, it is heard that the new early-harvest Ke Jian variety from Wuhu is about to be harvested, and there is also a large amount of old stock, and a large batch of Ke Jian may arrive in port soon. Therefore, yesterday the japonica rice market was very active, and market prices rose by more than one yuan. Wuxi fresh japonica was priced at 27 yuan, and old stock at 26 yuan to 25.5 yuan. Changzhou fresh japonica was 27 yuan, and old stock was 26 yuan. Kunshan japonica was 26.5 yuan to 25.5 yuan. Songjiang fresh Bo Dao rice was 26 yuan per dan, Bo was 25 yuan, Gao Wu Jian opened at 23 yuan, medium at 22 yuan, Bian Yuan was at par, and Zeng opened at 25 yuan to 26 yuan. More than 5,000 packages were transacted.</p>
<p>The lifting of the ban on Ke Xian is difficult to realize, and people's hearts are even more anxious. Yesterday, shops and retailers were extremely eager to buy, and market prices secretly jumped up. Gao Jing Xian even reached a new high price of 33 yuan, and Te Wu Xian also needed 32 yuan. Medium-quality rice uniformly followed, rising by seven or eight cents or one yuan or several cents compared to the previous day. 3,000 packages were offered for sale.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Affected by foreign exchange rates, sellers are hoarding goods. There are no formal offers for both new and old Saigon rice. However, it is rumored that small quantities of new Saigon rice distributed to customers have already been sold at 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Not Much Arriving; Wheat Prices Rise Frequently; Flour Mills Prevent Outside Speculation, Reduce Production and Only Supply Local Sales <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the factory prices for spot flour remained temporarily unchanged, but the situation was very firm. This is because the raw material wheat is becoming more expensive every day, and each factory's production is also low, so they are still not opening up to large-scale bulk purchases. Even small-scale retail transactions in the local market are being restricted, in order to prevent outside speculation and manipulation. It is heard that the number of transactions yesterday was only 4,000-5,000 packages. Reclaimed warehouse receipts were higher than factory prices, but few were offered. It is heard that the selling price of each bag at various flour shops on this street is 5.625 yuan, delivered with cartage, and each shop is only limited to delivering 50 bags or less.</p>
<p>Wheat prices continued to rise yesterday. This is because not much has arrived recently, and the demand from various factories is constant. Furthermore, some hoarders are buying in the market, causing the market to rise again and again. Yesterday, the Fu and Fu factories purchased 15 carts of wheat from Danyang, Qishuyan, Wuhu, Changzhou, and Puzhen, at prices ranging from 8 yuan to 7.77 yuan. Hoarders purchased more than 10 carts of wheat from Guan Dian, Liuhe, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Anting, at prices ranging from 8.7 yuan to 7.9 yuan, continuing to rise by one or two cents compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Miscellaneous Grains: The Oilcake Market is Chaotic; Trading Suspended for Three Days <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains and oil bean cake market suddenly and uniformly established unprecedented high prices. This was mainly due to the actions of some powerful individuals, who fueled the situation, manipulated goods for profit, and speculators who joined in, causing the lives of ordinary people to become increasingly difficult. Yesterday's market situation was solely focused on upward expansion, and was exceptionally chaotic. Therefore, trading will be suspended for three days, starting today (the 12th), until the 15th when the market reopens. A total of 500 tins of peanut oil were transacted, and were continuously purchased by Hong Kong dealers. A total of 1,300 pieces, as well as 500 drums and 1,200 tins of soybean oil, and 1,700-1,800 packages of soybeans, and 2,500 packages of broad beans were transacted. In addition to one-third of each commodity being sold locally, the remainder was purchased by hoarders.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Soar <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

According to a London telegram, there was only a slight increase of half a penny to two-five. February was six shillings, two and seventy-five pennies, March next year was six shillings, two and a half pennies, and June was six shillings, two and seventy-five pennies.

Foreign warehouses were at 37.88 yuan, and later arrivals were at 38.5 yuan. Transshipment goods rose by 1.5 to 2 yuan, to 29.5 to 30 yuan.

<p>More than 40 pieces of Shuidong branches produced in Haikou have arrived. The first offer has already been made, reaching as high as 61 yuan. Yesterday, the Taishun wheel imported another two batches, more than 80 pieces of Haikou branches, and more than 20 boxes of Jinshan branches. As the current market inventory is low, the trend is still favorable. If the goods are of high quality, continued tightening of prices can be expected.</p>
