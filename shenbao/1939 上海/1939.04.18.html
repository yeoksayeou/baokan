<h3>蔣委員長廣播演講　實施國民精神總動員　精神力量的偉大超過一切物質力量抗戰即建國兩大責任幷作一起完成切實檢討缺點一致奮起求自身改造打破投降屈辱企圖以充實民族精神</h3>

<h3>精神總動員與上海市民</h3>
<p>從昨天起到本月二十三日止，全中國各省市一律舉行國民精神總動員宣傳週，而今天又適値市民界宣傳日。在中國抗戰逐漸進入新階段的目前，在日軍對華軍事日感困難，而正企圖用種種陰謀方法動搖中國抗戰的目前，這偉大的國民精神運動實有着深切而重大的意義。</p>
<p>國民精神總動員綱領是經中國國民黨五中全會和參政會第三屆大會通過，而由中央政府公布施行的。它規定了國民公約，要全國國民宣誓遵守；並規定從下月一日起，全國各團體各機關應於每月舉行國民月會，以檢討每人自已是否能夠確切遵守國民公約，是否能夠忠實履行精神動員的綱領。這一運動，決非是僅有消極的意義，而是有積極的作用；這一運動，也決非是徒具形式的「官樣文章」，而是有着充實內容的，每一個愛國國民必須執行的重大任務。我們要知道，在抗戰進入新階段的今天，距離中國勝利的前途固然日近，但中國所遭遇的艱難郤也必然日益加深和擴大。因爲日本軍閥鑒於對華軍事的無望，它一定會用盡一切最毒辣的陰謀，搖撼中國人的意志，威脅中國人的精神，分化中國人的團結，來從根本上破壊中國抗戰的。中國要取得勝利、首先就必須克服這些一切艱難，必須合力樹立强固的精神堡壘，淬礪奮鬥，以粉碎日帝國主義各色各樣的破壊中國抗戰的陰謀。蔣委員長說得好：「　最近敵人側重政治的舞弄，捏造事實，離間國人，無非先要制服我們的精神，分解我們的精神，……要打破這種陰謀，……更要特別注重精神抵抗力，不僅應該動員國內的一切物質和人力，而且要動員全國的精神和意志，不僅發動全國的精神，而且要組織起已經發動的精神，以有組織的精神，發揮有組織的人力，利用有組織的物質，然後可以掃蕩侵略的强敵，樹立戰後建國的永久基礎。」</p>
<p>上海雖然已成了「　孤島」，但是四百萬不願做奴隸的上海市民，郤沒有一個不朝夕縈念着祖國的前途，沒有一個不想替國家民族盡一份力。在舉行國民精神總動員宣傳週的今天，上海的市民一定會更形淬礪奮發，踴躍地擔負起自己崗位上的責任，現在，趁着這個機會，我們特別指出此時此地的兩個最迫切最重大的任務，希望上海市民切實地積極地做去：</p>
<p>第一個上海市民應該擔任的任務，就是徹底根絕在派賣國叛逆的活動。誠如本市精神總動員協會「　吿同胞書」中說：「　敵人因軍事侵略失敗，轉而謀政治陰謀之發展，利用我少數的民族敗類，企圖動搖我抗戰之大局。汪逆精衛…………竟勾通敵國，公然求降。……且密遣爪牙，來滬蠢動」。是的，今天的上海，確已成了日軍特務機關與在派漢奸陰謀活動的中心，無論那一方面。幾乎隨時隱現着他們的魔手。例如在派嘍囉周佛海等，已在上海敎育界的活動，在逆機關關關報「　抗議」等的傳播侮辱領袖離間團結的漢奸論調，都値得嚴密注意。每一個愛國的上海市民，必須一致努力撲滅這種漢奸的理論，根絕這批民族敗類的蠢動！</p>
<p>其次從今天起，上海市民也必須徹底努力自身生活的改進。不必諱言，自從上海淪爲孤島以後，有一部份人由於內心的煩悶，或由於外界惡勢力的誘惑，往往沉醉於聲色犬馬的角逐，以致意志日形頹唐，生活日趨腐化。這實是一個嚴重的危機。老實說，中國之所以不能被征服，就在於中國人心不能被征服。如果中國人朝夕耽於腐化生活，精神一天天頹唐，那豈非正上了人家的圈套。須知賭窟無異魔窟，烟槍等於手愴，那正是日軍漢奸害殺中國人最毒辣的武器。上海的市民，如果有沉迷於這方面的，從今天起必須徹底改正，或者廣勸別人改正過來，這是第二個最迫切的任務。</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況仍極堅挻、趨勢極為良好、買氣之旺、當為暗市以來所罕見、謠言繁與、國內形勢及國際形勢均已轉入有利階段、美國大批軍艦集中太平洋、顯有項荘舞劍之意、歐洲風雲、當可適可而止、國際貸款源源而來、可見債務人之可恃、中日戰事愈見順利、市上盛傳銀行界有在買進、素來著名之某某等大户、亦有大批收買、市氣之佳、自有由來、微聞各債可以向銀行做押款、折扣至為優惠、傳言之多、姑待事實證明、惟有一點為漲風最大之主動、今年度以來、各種投機事業均已無利可圖、紗花已漲價過高、外匯經當局之制止、絕無上落、即套利亦無利可圖、標金及外幣、亦以價格過高、危險極多、其他各種凡可以投機者、均高至頂峯、無從措手、因此現多過剩、觀於連日貼現平疲、亦可想見、咸轉移自標集中於證劵市場、且其價格猶在中盤·英使抵滇、和平空氣更見濃厚、大戶多頭不斷加碼、散戶放空、雖前仆後繼、終以勢力懸殊、無法抵抗、經此番搜購後、檯面籌碼愈見稀少、甲種已上達六十二元、市上咸估此番有六十五元之希望、九六居然亦超出七元關、聞北幫正在從事收買、故前途好面尚多、茲將一月十日之高價列後、以資參考、</p>

<p>外股行市據衆業公怕所報告、自美總統羅斯福發表和平呼顯後、市面較佳、惟人心仍未見熱烈、因鋻於過去數次之願望、未曾得好音、怡和股交易活躍、受紗價上漲之原因、成交價高至二十元零一角、公共汽車成交二十七元、瑞镕普通股成交六元七角五分、業廣股疲弱成交八元五角、電話六厘債劵巨額成交九十五元、</p>

<h3>金融　津幫仍在吸購　現金價尚乏變化</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、情勢愈形呆滯、始終少變、價則終日徘徊於二千〇七十五元及七十八元之間、蓋各方均幫替德　美總統之覆文、內容如何為目標、中途雖證劵幫（復代天津幫）、結現金號等吸購、無如某金號與錢兌業吐售尚殷、故未蒙影響、結果較上週末亦無榮辱、一天成交不多、上午均四百餘兩、下午則未有做開、銀樓飾金仍未更動、海關金暨中英純金等亦俱無升降</p>
<p>烚赤下午未做開</p>
<p>自晨每條十兩、初開證劵幫首先喊二千〇七十五元買進、但出者須八十元方肯供給、雙方直擯持至九進五十分方始成交、首見證劵幫進銀樓幫五十兩、二千〇七十八元為開盤價、較上週末做高一元、開後某金號賣意雖濃、但現金號與銀樓幫吸力尚佳、是以為狀頗平、金號賣予銀樓幫共百兩、及現金號五十兩、價均與晨開相同、繼之錢兌業吸進某銀號五十兩、價亦七十八元、現金號又進銀樓幫五十兩、價仍七十八元、此後某錢兌業突來吐售、且其時買方進意淡薄、形勢略疲、某錢兌業賣同業共百兩、價均七十五元、嗣後證劵幫復來吸收、潛勢轉穩、證劵幫進銀樓幫五十兩、價七十七元、時已十一點許、此後供求稀少、價亦呆定、延至午時未見做開、故午收仍作七十七元、午後供求更稀、市況呆滯、某錢兌業雖喊七十七元賣出、但進者還價七十六元方肯吸收、雙方直擯持至晚收時仍未聞隻條做開、據聞錢兌業門市亦頗沉寂、若照午收價二千〇七十七元、結果較上週六晚收未分榮辱、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇八十五元、收進二千〇七十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出、因烚赤勢甚穩定、故亦仍未更動、大同行為二百十一元、新同行二百〇九元、收進二百〇三元、</p>
<p>關純金亦無更改</p>
<p>中央銀行這中國現金收買價、仍屬一千二百二十元三角、掛牌海關金亦為二元三角九分六厘、上海標准金價亦無變更、計一千二百〇七元六角、乃十五日倫敦電、英純金每盎司未更、仍計七鎊八先令六辦士所致云、</p>
<h3>外匯結款仍未減少結果則平</h3>
<p>匯市昨以洋行結款、迄未減少、兼天津幫續來吸購、無如外行如匯豐等供塞頗力、且華行一度涌塞美匯、致中途美匯曾稍趨鬆、但不久即見回平、結果均無分榮辱、交易上午尚旺、而下午極清、至港匯因供求勢均、故為狀亦頗穩定、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠仍平、紐約銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金仍無升降、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英突漲四三七五、（恐誤）、對滬勿動、對法長三一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之上週末午收、未分榮辱、開後洋行雖扒、但以英行匯豐供意仍佳、故缺乏變化、洋行結進匯豐英匯八辦士二五匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無上落、仍徵百分之五〇〇、此後華行突來湧塞美匯是以為狀微鬆、華行賣予有利（代天津幫）美匯十六元〇九三七五、嗣後洋行結款漸繁、於是潛勢轉平、洋行結進荷蘭、華比某行美匯十六元〇六二一、將近午時、成交轉清、僅略有港匯買賣、但形勢亦平、洋行吸進外行安達港匯五十六元、迨午收銀行賣價、與晨開無異、</p>
<p>收市情況頗形沉寂、價亦穩定、僅聞洋行略有結進外行英匯八辦士二五、然美匯與港匯則未聞成交、迨晚收銀行賣價、英匯八辦士二五、美匯一六元〇六二五、港匯五十六元、結果較上週末午收、英美港三匯俱無上落、</p>
<h3>澳金票獨降三角半</h3>
<p>上週六英純金及英美匯兌俱未更動、昨日本埠外匯、洋行需要甚殷、外銀行供給頗暢、美匯頭寸且較寬裕、一度鬆動、嗣銀行吸胃頗旺、漸呈穩定、結果英美匯無分榮辱、烚赤開盤堅定、無如進者見市價已高、買意淡薄、賣方懾於客幫威力、套回困難、雙方堅持未下、交易驟感稀少、下午未有做開、市況穩定而呆滯、惟錢兌業烚赤交易頗形活躍、比之交易所生色多矣、外幣英美金鎊、殷富多拋塞、英美金票供求尚盛、多趨穩定、僅澳金票有供給、下跌較烈、公會交易未做開、昨日市價英金票升一分、法郎票升七毫半、澳金票降三角半、其他各幫、俱未更動、</p>

<p>新醫典新藥週刋論言勿隨地吐痰  程瀚章　　本市婦女運動會及兩租界華人敎育處等團體，近日發起淸潔衛生吐痰運動，製就標語，廣勸各界遵守，以保公衆佛康，其熱心殊堪欽佩，而我醫界同人竟未能倡導於先者，則則則又對之彌滋愧恧焉。　　夫隨地吐痰，誠爲惡習，在稍受敎育者，早多力矯其弊。惟頑固老朽鄉農苦力之流，旣未受新知識之灌輸，亦不知公衆衛生爲何事，依然在公共塲所，毫無顧忌，聲咳一聲，黏痰射地者，頗不乏人，故勸止隨地吐痰之標語，簡單易曉，正爲此輩而設，洵可謂對症下藥之舉也。但關於此事之標語，大都偏於消極的誥誡一面，而爲推行便利起見，似應重在積極的處理方法，謹抒管見如左：　　（一）標語謂　隨地吐痰就要傳染癆病一。隨地吐痰之人，或非盡由由由本心所業爲，殆一時急不暇擇，不得不如此耳，彼旣無法使之不吐，而又無適當處所可吐，故須說明吐出後，應如何處置，似較空言勸誡爲有效。（二）標語謂一多運動常洗澡身體好痰就少一。此僅爲普通感冒之預防，以期痰不發生耳，然患慢性支氣管炎（老人性）及他種呼吸器病者之痰，仍未能依此法而消滅。（三）標語謂「隨地吐痰容易傳染疾病一。凡預防傳染病之發生或蔓延，均可適用消毒方法，故如何可以消毒，亦應說明。（四）標語謂「隨地吐痰是一個不良習慣一。此條過於抽象，如何方能將不良習慣，變爲良好習慣，似應具體指出。　　根據以上理由，擬另補充數則，以冀易收實行之效。　　（一）吐痰應在手帕或軟紙內。　　（二）痰盂內常澆消毒水。　　（三）吐出之痰，應即燒却，以防傳染。　　（四）衣袋中多置手帕軟紙，以備納痰。　　（五）耍養成吐痰在軟紙內習慣。通俗醫話哺乳障礙與離乳（卽斷乳）（續第十三期）  王吉誠　　（三）結核結核菌存於母乳中致發生傳染問題者，殆未之見，不過因乳兒與母體非常接近的關係，則傳染機會自然增多。故遇開放性結核，視爲哺乳障礙發生之理由由由固不待言，但在非開放性結核時，則並無特別別別中絕哺乳之必要，唯因哺乳而致母體呈現衰弱徵候時，則則則以一時中止爲良，蓋　在性結核，每易變爲活動性結核，而使症狀增惡故也。　　（四）急性傅染病種種急性傳染病，如傷寒，丹毒，白喉等之細菌，預存於乳汁中，以致傳染之事，雖屬無之，但因密切接觸，以致傳染之危險極大，故實有一時停止哺乳之必要。　　（五）母之乳頭畸形乳頭過小陷沒，或大而扁平時，均可發生哺乳障碍，但此並非絕對的，可設法矯正，减少困雞，然後哺之，如乳頭過小時，用酒精，甘油等摩擦，使其稍大，陷沒時，常常牽引之，俾稍伸張，眞不得巳時，可以手壓乳，用匙哺育之。　　（六）乳腺炎或乳頭炎此時可行短期的哺乳中絕，至症狀輕快時，再繼續哺乳。　　（七）再妊娠若授乳期中，兒母叉現妊娠徵候時，乳汁中雖無何種障碍存在，唯因哺乳以致母體感覺衰弱或呈消瘦之觀者，此際不得不實行斷乳　　乙，由於乳兒的原因　　（一）吸啜力微弱的乳兒如早產兒，虛弱兒等吸乳力極爲微弱時，可於短期內實行榨乳，用匙給與之，或用橡皮管實施鼻腔營養，待乳兒之營養回復吸啜力增加後，再行哺乳方、法。（二）先天畸形　在高度的先天鼻腔閉塞，口蓋破裂，兎脣等時所發生之營養障碍，可依前述榨乳方法行之。　　（三）乳房嫌忌　通常乳兒概於生後二三日即嗜啜乳，然有時亦有乳兒嫌忌乳房（或係嫌忌乳汁）而怠於吸乳者，或爲神經質性乳兒，亦未可知。是時可用榨取之乳汁，以哺乳器哺之，若行飢餓方法，誘其漸决吸乳亦善。　　二，離乳　　哺乳兒廢棄母乳而改用其他營養品，乃爲遲早必經之階段，此母乳之廢棄，名曰離乳，或曰斷乳。　　何時離乳，因國別不同，而大有歧異。最速者土人（一種南非洲種族），至分娩後第四個月，便即離乳，最遲者爲Eskims人種（住於北美洲極北之蒙古種族，至十四五歲，授乳方始全停，至日本方面，授乳期間亦復甚長，每常延至三四歲時，允以對於未子爲最，竟有至七八歲時尙繼續哺乳者（據柿本博士）。　　乳兒滿一年以上，尙不給與其他營養叩時，常皮色蒼白，見之有如虛弱兒童，其原因大概由於生後一年間乳汁之營養分雖然充分，但旣滿一年後，僅靠母乳中之營養素，便感不足，於是各臟器之發育受影響，由此可知選擇適當時期實行斷乳，殊爲必耍。然何時離乳方爲適當？諸學者之意見雖未完全一致，但大抵以乳齒之發生期爲標準，即從七八個月至十一個月之間開始，徐徐行之，藉防發生離乳期消化不良症，待將近一年，乃增加米粥或用麵包，後且混入卵黃，至一年五個月時，更給與容易消化之魚肉蔬菜等，繼之以其他種種果實，再漸漸移行於小兒之普通食物。　　離乳之開始時，當然須視母乳之分泌量及乳兒之營養狀（接第十四版）中·美·英·法·德·瑞·日　藥典之比較  周夢白　張養智　　各國對於用藥，因氣候之寒熱，身體之强弱，而有區別，故各國以適合其自國人民，均各，日本藥局方等是·我國雖亦有中華藥典之出版，然醫生之用藥，均從其學自何國者爲準，如學自德者準德國藥典，學自英者準英國藥典。本國學校出身之醫生，亦從其師歸自何國者爲準，如師歸自美者，則準美國藥典，師是歸自日者，則準日本藥局方。藥師配方，亦惟從共所準者配與之·倘醫生隨意寫方，則無所準，可以亂投·因藥物貪量純凈有不同，對於治療常有失效時，故新醫不能盡取信於國人者，此亦其一因也。處此過渡時期，藥師造藥，應遵從中華藥典，醫生處方，亦應從中華藥典外，再將常用各國藥典之藥物，作一對照比較，知其不同之點何在，以便有所適從，以便有所校正，想亦爲醫藥兩界同志所樂知也。依中華藥典决序，用敢刊諸新醫與新藥週刋，失檢之處　，幸有正之。　夢白寫自中法化學製藥廠　　１.Acetanilidum醋酸基錏基困（中，美，法，德，瑞）Antifebrinum（美，法，德，瑞，日）（中）本品爲無色有光輝之葉狀結晶或白色結晶性之粉末·無臭·味微辛·在空氣中無變化·能溶於水，醇，瞇，氯仿，醒酮，困，及甘油中·熔融點爲113o-115o；中性；劇藥·　　（美）　Acetanilid　熔融點113o-115o。　　（法）　Acetanilid　熔融點114o；沸騰點295o。　　（德）　Azetanilid　熔融點113o-114o；劇藥。　　（瑞）　Antifebrina　熔融點112o-113o；劇藥。　　（日）　　　　　　　　　熔融點113o-114o；劇藥。　　（別名）　安替非布林，Antifebrinum.　　（功用）　解熱，鎮痛藥。（內服）　　（劑量）　一次時　0.1-0.25gm　　　　　　　　　　　　　一日量　0.75gm.　　（貯藏）　置玻璃瓶內，注意貯之。　　２.Acetonum醋酮（中，美，英，德，瑞，日）（中）本品爲無色透明易搖動之揮發性輕質液體。奥特異。味辛而微甘。遇火則放有光輝之火焰而燃燒。於水，醇，　，　仿及多數之揮發油均能混和。比重（25oC）約0.790；沸騰點爲56o-58o；劇藥。　　CH3oCOoCH3=58.05　　（美）　Acetonum　比重（25o）約0.790；沸騰點爲56o-58o。　　（英）　Aceton　比重（15.5o%爲0.796-0.801；蒸溜溫度56o-58o。　　（德）　Azeton　密度0.790-0.793；沸騰點55o-56o。　　（瑞）　Acetone　比重0.797-0.800；蒸溜溫度55o-56.5o劇藥。　　（日）　　　　　　比重0.795-0.798；蒸溜溫度55o-57o。　　（功用）　肺結核，痺熱症，（內服）　刺戟性外塗藥（外用）　　（劑量）　一次量　0.3-0.6gm　　（貯藏）　置密閉器中於冷暗處避火貯之。　　３.Acetphenetidinum醋酸基氱二烷　基困（中，美）Phenacetinum非那西汀（中，英，法，德，瑞，日）（中）本品可取冰醋酸及對位氱二烷錏基困，使相作用製之，爲無色有光輝之鱗片狀結晶，或白色結晶性之粉末。臭無。味微苦。露置於空氣中無變化。能溶於醇或氤仿中；難溶於水。熔融點爲134o-135oC；灰化後，遺留灰分，不得過0.05%（檢無機雜質）；加十倍量之硫酸溶解之，不得染色（檢有機雜質）；劇藥。　　（美）　Acetphenetidin　熔融點134o135o；灰化殘渣0.05%　　（英）　Phenacetin　熔融點134o-136。　　（法）　Oxethylpara-acetanilide(Phenacetine)　　　　　　　熔融點135.。　　（德）　Phenazetin　熔融點134o-135；劇藥。　　（瑞）　Fenacetina　熔融點133o-135o；劇藥。　　（日）　　　　　　　熔融點134o-135o；劇藥。　　（功用）　解熱藥，鎮痛藥（內服）　　（劑量）　一次時　0.25-1gm　　　　　　　　　　　　　一日量　3gm.　　（貯藏）　置玻璃瓶中，注意貯之。　　（製劑）　Compressi　acidi　acetylosalicylici　Compositi（瑞）</p>

<p>（接第十三版）態，適宜行之。母乳充分時，除哺乳外，首用羹湯果汁，後用稀粥等，漸决替代乳汁。母乳不足時，最初用牛乳等之人工營養品補替之，次乃試以羹湯，再徐徐移行於稀粥。又小兒之營養不足時或營養障碍後營養之回復遲延時，宜用牛乳粥（以牛乳稀釋之粥），藉防營養價之减少。　　離乳時期，係小兒生活上一大轉變，若不愼重從事，危險殊甚，蓋營養佳良小兒，因離乳方法不當，致起消化不良，更遭悲慘之結局者，非不有也。又據前述離乳的適當時期，乃以乳齒發生期爲標準，苟此離乳時期巧逢盛夏，便不適宜，當以延至氣候凉爽之秋季爲是，若逢夏初，則可稍稍提早行之。食養常識食養之科學研究（續第十一期）  周振禹　　按諸現代科學，其所發現之事實，可分爲兩部：一曰理化之構造，二曰生命之過程。生命過程之研究，近數十年來，其進展之程度甚速。綜合分爲三點：（甲）確定人類進化之原理，及其遺傳之機能。（乙）發現微生物，及其活動能力。繼定傳染病之原理，並知衛生之途徑，以及檢騐微生物之技術。（丙）食養之新發現，及其性質。此項之學識，現代歐美一人士，硏究不遺餘力，其將來之重要性，實無限量也。　　食養之硏究，多關健康，食某物則有益，食某物則有害，有害者謂之日病質（Materia　Morbi），按諸現代科學，食養之害，其範圍當可瞭解，故致病之因素，則不難得。自維牠命之發現，在食養歷史上，遂開一新紀元，於是食養之道，允堪注意矣。　　食物種類繁多，性質各有不同，選擇不當，烹調不法，多食少食，莫不與健康有關，輕則有損，重則致病，食養之重要性質，由此可見矣。　　體魄之長育，及其形態，均賴食養以維持，其功用一也。增進體魄之抵抗能力，以禦疾病之侵襲，其功用二也。抵抗能力云者，乃食養如得其法，體魄對於疾病之感染性則减低，免疫能力則自增矣。查醫學上之所謂抵抗能力，乃指身體血液中，有抗毒素，或出諸天然者，或出出出諸人爲者，作爲武器，以防疾病之侵襲，猶國防之有軍備，兩者不可並論也。然則食養與衛生，在預防醫學上，所佔之地位，亦屬重要。按現代醫學，分爲兩種，一曰治療醫學，二曰預防醫學。前者專主治療理論。後者專持預防理論，而爲現代各國所最注重者也。　　健康者，體魄健全之謂也。常人多以身體健全與不健全，爲先天性的，非後天人力所能轉移者，故體魄不健者，多長嘆短吁，歸之於命。其實不然。昔美總統羅斯福（Rooseevelt)身體不健康，惟因其食養有加，竟成强壯健全之政治家。葛蘭斯頓（WilliamEwart　GladstoneSir）者，英大政治家也。食養合度，體健智足，行事往往有過人之處，主政四次，世人莫不驚訝欽佩，每吿人曰：一口食物應咬嚼三十二决之多。故健康者。非獨無病而已，體健智足，爲有爲之事業者，乃眞正健康之謂也。　　現代食養之學識，日見發達，先天營養充足，遺傳性狀優良，固屬要素，但後天日常之衛生及食養，允爲重要，蓋此種優良之潛伏質地，能使天賦之性狀，更爲顯著之發展，以獲得眞正健康之體魄也。　健康之轉移，臆度多端，朝三暮四，莫衷一是，其所以然者，蓋無科學指導之故，實非常識之所不能及者也。最近英國劍橋大學生物化學敎授赫氏（Erederick　G·Hopkins宣稱「後犬敎養之能力，若能推廣其範圍，大可輔助先天之不足」，信乎斯言也。　　現代科學家，有鑒於斯，故多側重利用個人之常識，以作食麥之選擇，而成爲一普遍性之良好習慣。　　食養之選擇，多爲個人或一家之事，若常識充裕，加有科學之指導，其問題頗感興趣，且屬可靠，願讀者加意焉。食物之有無毒性，視其化變之狀態若何，與諸受者之體質，是吾符合，合則無毒性之可言，不合則發生身體之反響。西諺曰一人之食物或變爲他人之毒物，此言雖有相當之理由，然不若理想之多也。蓋人禀天地之氣以生，體質各異，故物質接觸之能力，各不相同，致有個別之感應性（Idosynclasies），其性有强弱之別別別，但未始不可預防也。　　身體之構造，其所用之物質，非常複雜，單純一物，不足應用，食養一節，故亦不能單調，現經科學證實，非若空言臆測之可比。如出穀之鄉，專用之爲食其害決無可免之理。食之者，必多患軟骨病及癩皮病等。梅氏（Mlelanby）會以下級動物試騐，屢試屢騐，無不證明此說，是以食物之爲害與吾，視選用之者，是吾適當，豈穀之咎乎。　　食物爲滋養之品，可供養一切生物之生命，上級生物固賴之以生，下級生物，亦何獨不然。食物之腐爛，乃下級生物侵襲寄生之表現。下級生物有人目可見者，有不可見者，不可見者，則則則稱之日微生物，蓋可以顯微鏡探視之，或稱之日細菌。細菌分爲兩類，（一）有益於人類者，曰有益細菌，簡稱之曰益菌。（二）有害者，則稱之曰害菌，或病菌。前者爲人類所歡迎。後者爲人類之大敵，乃人人所必預防者。其預防之學術曰衛生學。此兩類細菌之生活稈度，及其活動能力，均有專書，故不贅述。惟食養與衛生，與民族民生均有重要性質，柄國政者希加意焉（完）</p>

<p>自由談宣誓  茂烈　　形式主義本來是要不得的，因爲徒騖外親，不重實際，其結果不過自欺欺人，徒事鋪張而已。例如大結婚，無非示其闊綽，大出喪，無非使弔者大悅，都不足爲訓。　　然而這是指的個人方面，若是一種羣衆運動，或公共行爲，那就非有某種適當的形式，堂堂正正地昭示於世人不可。這一星期內國民精神總動員協會的宣傳辦法中，有舉行國民公約宣誓一項，我認爲就是這種應有的形式，我們應該一律遵行。　　宣誓時，假使爲了環境關係，不能有大規模的集合，也當有小範圍的叙會，而隆重的儀式，負責指導者的到塲監視，則更是必需的條件。我想，這樣的分別舉行，一定可以獲得積極的與消極的兩種效益。　　積極的：在公共集合之下，年無分老幼，地位無分上下，力量無分大小，各以國民資格，宣誓一致團結，從事抗戰建國，那時，必能使每一個參加的人，發生深刻的印象，以後更必能使他們身體而力行之，有確實的成就。　　消極的：假使他是個不爲人知的漢奸，他就一定要設法規避，不肯前來宣誓，於此，我們就可以得到他的眞相，使他無所遁形。假使他做了漢奸，還敢前來參加，那他一朝敗露，我們就可以加以嚴重的制裁，使他無所怨尤，使其他漢奸，知所戒懼。　　積極的作用是奮勉我們自己，消極的作用是防止漢奸。進一步說，防止漢奸，是使他們不會妨害我們抗戰建國的大計，讓我們早日達到目的，所以消極的也就是積極的　　我希望：每一個支部，或者說，每一個團體，舉行這種宣誓時，所屬的每一個人，都能够到塲，不論他是怎樣的忙碌，即使有病，也會扶病而至，甚至舁牀而至，不作有意規避的漢奸；宜誓時，每一個人都會出以眞誠，決心，遵行國民公的，無論在事實上或理論匕，都不會有一些漢奸的嫌疑！　　最後我希望：宣誓之後，我們都會互相監視着，督促着，對於國民公的，始終奉行不背！賽珍珠新著「愛國者」  陳東林　　賽珍珠（Pearl　S.　Buck）是今年諾貝爾文學獎金的獲得者。她是以「中國通」的作家而聞名於世的，在這中國抗戰正猛烈進行着的常兒，諾貝爾獎金恰選中了這個素以中國爲題材的作家。國際的注意力，就在這文學一方面，也正集中於這努力掙扎着的中國呢。就在這時候，賽珍珠產生了一部以抗戰中的中國爲題村的作品-「愛國者」(The　Patrlot)，這無疑地會轟動世界各國的.　　「愛國者」的題材和她以前以中國爲背景的小說有着差異的地方：它底塲面一直開展到日本，在日木的風俗人情上有極細膩的解剖。一般的讀者對於她的關於日本的認識一定會感到趣味的。特別使我們中國讀者感到興趣的是，連蔣委員長也將成爲作品中的一個人物出現於讀者之前。　　「愛國者」的主角吳億萬，是一個上海大銀行家的兒子·這叛逆的兒子憎惡自己的家庭的一切——他憎惡他父親的財富，憎惡家庭中的種種禮敎的束縛，他對於他的四周的環境抱着深痛疾惡的態度。在這種苦痛之下，他終於受着他的窮困的女同學恩蘭的領導，在學校裏加入了共產黨做着組織與領導羣衆的工作，他感到了內心的慰藉·但唯心論者的他，以爲這世界上惟有「好」和「惡」，祇須簡單地把這「惡」去除了，一個理想的世界必定會出現的。那是正當北伐的烽火燃燒着全中國的時候，他對於革命正寄着絕大的希望，以爲只要革命成功，他所理想着的世界就會出現了。可是革命尙未完成，國共突然分家，接着而來的淸黨，使我們的億萬在中國無處容身，於是在有力的銀行家的他父親的百般設法之下，他才逃出虎口，亡命到東鄰的日本。　　希望被擊得粉碎的他，對於一切都感到絕望。在日本他居住在他父親的好友村木的家裹。在這裏，他看到了日本表面上像很平靜似的，但一些人們所有的自由是被剝削殆盡的。一切都被殘暴地統制着，雖然保持着所謂極端的平靜和秩序。後來億萬漸漸地愛上木村的女兒「珠一。在愛的漩渦裹，動亂的中國的影子竟漸漸地在他底心中淡薄起來，突然發生而又迅速地結束的九一八事變也不能使他受到多大感動，而當報紙大談和平的時候，億萬却和珠結婚了。他們的結婚是很幸福的，不久億萬就變成了二個孩子的父親。甜蜜的家庭生活使他拋棄一切希望，他已融化在這另外一個環境中。可是不久，蘆溝橋的砲聲響徹華北，驚醒了全國的人民，終於也使我們的主角奮然而起，接着而來的國共合作，使億萬有了做夢也想不到的歸國的機會。他便拋棄一切，毅然單身歸國。他已經決心犧牲一切，獻身於拯救中國民族的事業。回國後，他被蔣委員長派遣到中國的西北角去，而在那裏他又重會了從前的恩蘭—現在已經是第八路軍的軍官了。他加入了他們的隊伍，在廣袤的平原上展開着對日軍的游擊戰。在工作中，億萬又恢復了他原來的革命理想。奴隸的夢  柳攸　　金黃色中帶上了春的風光，紅燈綠酒和淸婉的歌曲，這最使人依戀的情景，是奴隸的夢！　　奴隸們，躱避不了壓迫者的皮鞭，他們悲嘆着自己的命運，任入家束縛，蹂躪，所博得的，是那個甜蜜的迷夢！　　奴隸的夢，染着醉人的色彩，蕩動了入們悽愴的心情，夢中，所見的都異常的綺麗，所聽的都十分的幽爽，所得的都無比的寳貴，在夢裏，都好似羽化登仙了！　　但是，這奴隸的夢，爲了做這華美的夢，忘了做奴隸的哀怨，忘了未來可怕的命運！　　甜蜜而奢侈的夢，繫着了千萬個奴隸的心，爲了這霎時間的樂趣，忘去無限的苦痛！　　夢，奴隸的夢，這好似一把無比鋒利的快刃，將這些可憐的人們，推上斷頭台，處了斬首的死刑　　奴隸的夢，好似一縷縷的細絲，作繭似地將人囚着了！　　有一天，這使人陶醉的奴隸的夢將被擊得粉碎，祇剩下千萬個奴隸的哀鳥！　　捨去這個留戀的夢吧，不如在做奴隸的人們，拿出毅力來，自己擊破這個夢！中國的春天  羅華　　冷寂的懷抱裏，輕輕的暖風一陣；看輕快的四圍，張開我們的心眼。靜靜的大地上，綠綠的小草一片；是新生的節季，展開我們的笑臉。古老的板橋下，潺潺的河水一流；有蘊藏的活力，站起我們的身軀。艷紅的花業中，靑靑的山岡一排；這嚴肅的沉着，挺起我們的胸膛。蒼翠的枝枚梢，嫩嫩的萌芽一簇；是發展的徵象，伸展我們的臂膀。寂寂的原野裏，隆隆的新雷一陣；聽怒吼的呼聲，握緊我們的槍枝。鬱鬱的夜黑裏，隱隱的晨曦一綫；這想望的光亮，整齊我們的步伐。蔚藍的高空裏，白白的日頭一個；是祖國的山河，歡唱我們的凱歌。又多了一頁一種啓示  啟明　　天下着雨，很討厭！但是我知道雨是會住的，只要風一轉向，太陽就會出來的。　　我生着病，很痛苦！但是我知道病是會愈的，只要我講求衛生，不久我就可以恢復健康，快樂地做人　　國家受到了欺侮，很艱難！但是我知道欺侮是會過去的，只要我們一致抵抗，奮力建國，不久我們就可以有一個光明燦爛的中華民國。　　天下凡事，宇宙萬物，都有一定的條理，一定的軌道。失條理爲混亂，出軌道爲禍害。不能說絕對不會有混亂與禍害，然而這畢竟是暫時的，條理與軌道，終將萬古常存，永遠不滅。暫時與永恒比較起來，算得什麽！　　我們看，遠遠地看，在致雨的！密雲的背後，不是依然有太陽在照耀着麼？在呻吟宛轉的身體的隱處，不是依然有健全的體魄在支持着麽？在分崩離析的國家的深處，不是依然有雄渾浩瀚的國魂在振作着麽？我們的希望不是徒然的，實現之期更不是遙遠的！　　我們努力吧，旣不要失望，更不要心焦，一切的不幸，就不過如噩夢一般，不久就會消滅得無影無踪，當淸晨的光明來到的時候！領袖崇拜論  白櫻　　好像有人這樣說過，每一個靑年，在心目中應該有個崇拜的中心人物。我們平常總常聽說某人是個有思想的人物，其實凡是人都有思想的活動，所以特別指出某人係有思想的人物，實際上就是說某人的思想是有組織的，並不是一般人所共有的散漫的思想。　　一個人的思想發展到有組織化，系統化，固然得經過思想上的種種演展——經騐，學識的漸决充質，但這里必然有個不可或缺的要素：人物崇拜。不過並非是偶象式的人物崇拜，而是理智的科學的人物崇拜。　　一個人的思想如果趨向組織化，他的思想發展過程無論怎樣的曲綫形，必定有一定程度的定型。而决定這種定型的，就是領導其思想向一定方向展開去的某一人。這某一個人雖在一開始時並不存在於我們的思想之中，但思想發展至一定程度時，這樣的人物就會在我們的心目中出現，隨思想的進展而進展，我們對於這某一個人的信心逐漸深刻，終至對之發生崇拜心理。唯有思想的演展到了這樣的一個階段，我們的信心才有一定的歸宿；也唯有在思想過程上得來的人物崇拜，才配稱科學的人物崇拜。　　有些人很反對英雄崇拜觀念，這種人的觀點偏重於時勢造英雄的說法，而漠視了個人在歷史上的作用。一個人的所以成爲偉人，成爲某些羣衆的崇拜對象，固然由於此人的種種環境決定，但主要還是這人的性格能綜合他時代環境的精華於一身，而將之具體化於他的生活及思想方式中。而成偉人，英雄成大衆欽仰的中心，其原因就在這里。領袖的所以不同於一般芸芸衆生，就是他能主動地把握環境且遝用之。雖然他的這樣做還得由於羣衆的推動，但這種推動力的決定點，還得集中於他的一身，領袖和羣衆力是一種有機的構成，彼此不能分離。　　也許有人認爲一般羣衆的英雄崇拜，是偶象形的崇拜，他們並沒有經過思想上的認識進程。但我們認爲一般羣衆是從現實生活上去直覺認識他們的領袖的。他們從現實生活上認識誰是眞正爲他們謀一福利，誰是眞正指導着他們生活的領袖，因此他們的英雄崇拜的形式，雖然近乎偶象式的，但實際上却是出發自現實生活。有時一個虛僞的領袖雖也能一時受羣衆盲目擁護—如在法西斯各國的情形——但不久在現實生活上他們就能認識領袖的眞面目，而加以推翻·　　最近讀了董顯光的蔣介石論，叉讀到了一篇列寗的傳記，我的心中就不禁想起西安事變前後民衆的如痴如在的感情，同時想像起列寗墓前四季不絕前來瞻仰遺容的蘇聯民衆。蘇聯的得有今日那樣的强盛，中國的得能完成今日那樣的偉大的統一，同心協力共赴抗戰，我們是不能小視了英雄崇拜——領袖崇拜的意義的。　　爲了充實自己的思想，爲了定型自己的人格，我們在自己心目中均應存在一個崇仰的中心人物。這不獨能充實我們的正義的信心，且能時時在精神上給我們不少慰藉。</p>

<p>春秋憧憬  文宗山　　這不是虛無飄渺的幻想；我往往會由微細的事物觸起一切憧憬。造成無數　想。　　「英雄主義」夠使一般人崇拜，我不例外。我想見到許多齊步出發的征人。鼓勵那顆未經染色的內心。睛朗的街頭，擠滿了人，等候着瞧什麽會吸引的事物來臨。果然，高頭大馬，尖亮的刺刀，整齊的步伐，一隊隊萬國商團作檢閱的形列走過。「中華隊」來了，一陣鼓掌，一陣歡呼，我愛瞧到这般雄糾糾的人物，來一吐二年來混濁的氣息。可是我連想到其他情形，這掌聲，歡呼祇好訴之於內心了！　　我的憧憬由於萬衆騰歡聲中產生，柏油馬路改爲崎嶇的公路，高樓大厦成了崇山峻嶺。刺刀依舊挺耀亮，步伐也嚴肅齊，可是，這齊步出發的都是爲自由，公理而戰鬥的青年，於是，我不怕喉嚨沙啞而狂喊了！手掌拍紅也不管，結果，也許會拾起打鳥的土槍隨行。　　然而，已往在我現在站立的地方，有一天猙獰的「勝利行列」。這又一個憧憬使我把内心積鬱着的憤怒之火又燒起。某校風光校舍的絕妙利用  金戈　　清早六點鐘光景，茶房阿令手裏拿了那隻缺了一角的破鈴，到各教室中去的鈴的鈴的搖，嘴裏像背書一般地駡道：「你們這班懶蟲！什麽時候了，還不想爬起來？」那些單身漢子們給鈴聲　醒了，趕忙爬出被窩，迅速地把被頭捲成一束，掮了鋪蓋上晒台去安放。　　阿令一問又一間的搖過來，那些單身客們也一個一個地被他趕出來。假使有個把漢子想假做沒有醒，以便懶在被窩中多睡一會，哼！阿令可不是好惹的！他把你被頭拉開來，把那　破鈴在你耳朶邊狠命地搖個不停，嘴裏還「媽呀娘的」一陣，你要響個「不」字，哼！報告校長王先生，你今晚上還想再睡在這裏嗎？　　阿令看看各教室都出清了，於是放掉鈴，換了把掃帚，打掃各宅，隨手把堆在角落裏的台櫈，重新排列起来。剛才是個大衆化的地鋪間，現在可是間神聖莊嚴的教室了。　　在六時半到八時半這兩個鐘頭裏，有兩隻教室是租給一隻商業補習學校開會計特科的。此時，那班候補會計師們也陸陸續續地來了。帶着惺忪的倦眼，有的還在打呵欠。　　不滿八點半，那些一小學生是不准進校的，祗許在校外的弄堂裏玩。因爲商業補習學校校長李先生跟校長王先生有約在先，「我們不是小學校，要清靜些的。」至於孩子们在弄堂裏，儘管他們掏陰溝，摸爛泥，校長王先生全不管的。　　八時半，阿令把校門一開，一面是那些候補會計師們性急忙忙地往外跑，他們有許多是商店真的職員，此刻要趕去應卯：一面是許多嘻皮笑臉的孩子們的往裏擠，兩面一擠，終有許多孩子們被擠倒在地上，哇哇地哭起來的。　　教室裏　在暗得要命，這是校長王先生　照過：非有他的命令，誰也不准私自開電燈。有一次，四年級教算術的陳先生，不見那些座位較後的孩子們實在不能看見黑板上的字，陳先生乃命阿令開電燈，後來給校長王先生知道了的，把陳先生呌來訓斥了一頓，說他非常時期不知道節省物力，扣了二元薪金，並警告他，下次再私自開電燈，撤職！　　體操在天井裏，唱歌在灶間裏，客堂一分二，前半間在房裏在讀英文；亭子間是校長王先生王太太的住宅……這一切，也不用細寫了。　　四點鐘一放晚學，孩子們是又一刻也不許停留在校裏，務須於十分鐘內拿了書包出校，因爲從四時半到六時半這兩個鐘頭內，校長王先生早把教室借給早晨的那隻商羣補習學校開打字班，他們不是小學校，要清靜些的，我已在前而表過。　　晚上有一個英文補習夜校，是校長王先生自己創辦的，分一·二·三·四·四級，王先生自兼第四級的教員。　　九點多鐘，英文尚未下課，那些單身漢的鋪房客們早掮了鋪蓋候在門口了。木蘭從軍  陳禾製　　可汗問所欲　木蘭不用尚書郎　　願借明駝千里足　送兒還故鄉（完）生活報告我們是汽車司機  徐穎輝　　司機這二字，讀者一見到，腦際裏定會浮起一陣思想——那是一種低微的職業啊！不，絕對不，這職業是勞働神聖的，是高尚聖潔的。盈千累萬的汽車，成天地由我們——司機員駕驶着，使它們爲我們人類盡忠地服務，發揮它特有的功效。所以我們的職業，是爲整個社會，整個國家，以至整個世界增進福利。　　我們所駕驶的汽車，分爲二種：一種是載重汽車，即一般所謂卡車。另一種是客車。　　自我國政府盡力從事於公路建設後，載重汽車在運輸中，頓形重要。駕駛這種汽車，是較辛苦的。每天清晨，便駕着且笨重又陋劣的載重車，向目的地進發；富人們正做着甜蜜的好夢，而我們爲了生活的驅迫，不得不晨起勞作。車上的小工，負着貨物，向車上搬運，我們祇眼看着他們劳作。四周，都是勞働的同志；在這兒沒有奢侈，虛偽，一切是純厚的。工作了五六小時，已是進午餐的時候，腹中正覺飢餓，走入平民化的飯店，胡亂地飽食一頓，也不能注意到清潔與衛生了。黄昏時，拖着木頭似的腿回家。臉上積滿了路上沙塵，衣服上滿沾着泥污；早上出去時，是一個整潔的人，而回來時則泥塵滿身，充塞着臭穢。如此勞作了三十天，所得的工資，祇三十餘元，除去了飯綫，所剩餘的不足三十元，一家老幼，以此過活，在這生活程度高升的海上，拮据自然是意料之中。　　駕驶客車，與駕驶卡車的境遇，完全不相同。主人們，都是公子哥兒，或大商巨賈——一般資產階級。他們可以終日不務事，成天地尋樂，沒有愁苦，也沒有憂慮。黑夜光臨了大地，正是他們活躍的時候；走進了歌舞靡費的塲所，一切是喜悅的，艷麗的，使人留連忘返。我們在外，廝守着空車，孤獨地期待着主人。陶酢的爵士音樂，從內傳露出來，此處是沒有勞働的純厚，完全是紙酢金迷的世界。在這清靜無聊的晚上，祇有瞌睡來消磨寶貴的光陰。夜深了，主人帶看歡樂的心出來，我們勉强地睜着惺忪的睡眼，駕着車子回去。駕駛客車，不錯，生活是舒適多了，工錢雖然祇有二十五元，或三十元左右，然而尚有額外的賜與；飯餐時，可以不必到飯店內去，且有較可口的充飢了。的確，是比駕駛卡車的生活，較舒適了，然而，成天地侵淫在浮華，奢侈的方面，這生活是太消沉了！　　自八一三發生後，許多同業的友人，相繼到後方去，爲國家效力，駕駛着軍需車，他們常於信中，驕傲地誇耀着他們的偉大及光榮。我輩是多麼的慚愧啊！仍滯留在這充塞着暮氣的孤島上，慚愧的火光，常於内心中燃燒起來。雨過天青  包天笑　　第八回　是幻是眞逢塲作戲　宜行宜止到處爲家　　那時要探聽陳君　踪跡，好不容易。因爲陳君就服務於某一個軍事機關裏，而這個軍事機關，就是流轉不定。况臣軍事上，有許多是秘密的，訪尋一個關係重要　人，也很不容易。湘子帶了這個小孩子，從南方到北方，從東區到西區，到處訪尋，終不能得到他的踪跡。訪尋了約摸有半午之久，陳君還沒有遇到，卻遇到了從前和陳君一同到日本去留學的李君。李君見湘子容光憔悴。非復當年，也深爲歎息。一問她的身世，湘子告訴他一切，哥哥戰死了，老父獄瘐了，自己孑然一身，僅留此一個孩子，是陳君的骨血。萬里尋夫，就是要這個孩子，得有父親。至於自己，既爲敵人之女，也不承望覆水重收。李君聽了，對於湘子很爲關切，他自然是知道陳君的踪跡的。因爲那時這個軍事機關，正駐紮在湘省的那一個地方。李君是在別一個軍事機關裏，現在正爲　有一些軍事上的要務，也要到湖南去。李君就向湘子說：你可以跟我到湖南去，我可以向陳君說明一切。你雖然是日本人，你在日本，可算得是絕無可以留戀之處。到了戰事停止以後，你們仍舊可以爲夫婦。而目我確切知道，自從你歸國後，陳君並沒有續娶。可見他是心中沒有忘掉你的，這件事，也足以使你安心了。過了幾天，湘子便跟着李君到湖南去了。她的意思：第一，是把孩子交還陳君。第二，勸陳君續娶，不要因爲我，阻礙了君的前途。可是到了湖南，陳君出差去了，說是三四天就可以回來。誰知陳君在歸途中，離他所駐的地方不遠，却遇到了敵機轟炸，在車子裏受了重傷了。送别醫院裏去，已經不治，及至湘子抱了孩子，趕到醫院裏的時候，陳君早已一瞑不視，爲國犧牲了。湘子想到好容易千山萬水尋到了陳君，以爲可以謀一面，豈知依舊撲了一個空。她待陳君　斂以後，把那個孩子，寄托給陳君的好友李君，自己就向湘水中一跳而死了。這便是『湘水的淚痕』剧本中的故事，據編劇人所談，這不全是空中樓閣，確實是有這樣一件事的，而劇中的陳君，還是編劇人的舊友啊。（八九）</p>

<p>游藝界無線電的妙用  陸德綱　　無線電除了供給人娛樂外，還有其他不少的妙用：　　在英國人們對於動物都很受愛護，為了要使牛馬貓狗雞鴨等也能享受快樂起見，有一家電臺便特地聘請專家來為這些禽獸播音。所播的東西都是各種口　，這種聲音傳進動物的耳朵裏面，會使它們搖頭擺尾，現出快樂欣喜的樣子，非常靈驗。據多次產驗和研究的結果，證明牛的聽覺程度最高，竟能懂得欣賞爵士樂呢。　　挪威的漁人最近發明利用無線電作為幫助捕鯨之用，以前捕鯨的方法是當漁人發見鯨魚後，便言立刻用魚叉射到鯨魚身上雲，但是鯨魚負傷後，每會溜得不知去向。所以現在有人發明魚叉上裝一只靈巧播音機，鯨魚中叉後，不論逃到任何地方，都避不掉漁人的耳目，因為鯨身的播音機不斷地將鯨魚的聲浪播出，漁人只須跟蹤去尋，無有不獲的。　　無線電還有另一妙用，就是能吸引許多海裏的魚類，捕魚的人在漁船上裝了架播音機後，便時常會有不少的鯊魚海綿（按：海綿乃是動物）等跟在船的左右竊聽，漁人只須費一舉手之勞，便可捕得大量的魚類了。老牌明星蕭英重上銀幕  金球寶　　他祝望黑暗的大地　　早些重複光明的青天　　使愛好電影的人們　　呼吸到自由解放的空氣　　在中國電影圈裏混了十幾年的老牌明星蕭英，自從在明星公司出來，脫離了影圈，改變行業，自己在法租界福履理路上開了一個建業百貨商店以外，日子真快，轉眼已經四年了。影迷們已漸漸的把這個英俊活潑，在銀幕上慣於表演軍人，父親，和反派小生的阿蕭的影兒忘掉了。　　阿蕭當年離開電影界的原因，曾經引起了當日許多的朋友和影迷們的猜測，但是據記者所知，他完全是因為家庭的關係，他在上海，家裏一共有九個人，（兩個老婆，是同胞姊妹，都嫁給他的，六個小孩子，連他自己）他在湖南長沙原籍，還有一位髮妻和一位年青美麗的女兒呢。他從前在明星公司做基本演員，薪水是一百八十元，因為了每月欠薪，弄得他青黃不接，家庭負擔又那麼的重，因此他在民國二十四年的秋天，就向明星公司方面辭了職，自己別找生路，來維持一家的生活。　　阿蕭今年五十歲了，還像個孩子一般的活潑天真，怪討人歡喜的，他的人生觀是「快樂和奮鬥」，他的私生活，又是那樣的嚴肅，不抽煙，不吃酒，不賭錢，不上舞場，一些嗜好都沒有。　　最近筆者在充滿著異國情調的福履理路上遇到了他，他邀我到他的建業百貨商店裏去談了一個多鐘頭，他談起了中國電影界的滄桑，和在這個大時代裏中國電影圈裏各人不同的生活，他說：「自己近來已重作馮婦了，這次承藝華公司邀我參加新片「影城記」，我對演技方面，久經荒疏，成績不能完美，要請大家原諒，我是老了，是落伍了！自己希望影迷們把蕭英忘掉。不過我近來是非常的興奮，自己雖然是不行了，但我近來看到我們中國的電影事業，一天一天的進步，而且新人也一天一天的在增加，無論從導演，音樂，佈景，收音，攝影，演技，等各方面，都比從彰大大的進步，想起了我十幾年前的處女作，不覺使人失笑，十幾年前的中國電影，是那麼的幼稚啊！顯然的，我們中國的電影事來，也是和我們的國家，社會，人生一樣的跟著這時代的巨輪前進。」　　阿蕭在筆者臨走的時候說：「他在祝望有那一年，有那一天，這目前的黑暗的大地，又重復到光明的青天，使我們電影界也呼吸到自由解放的空氣，能夠把現在這時代裏的人們所受的種種痛苦，暗無天日，流離顛沛的生活都在將來的銀幕上，給我們的子孫看，這部光榮的悲壯的好電影，是一定受到人們歡迎讚美的。」三幕悲劇「最先與最後」觀後感  鐵流　　這是我第二次看「上海劇藝社」一星期劇場的演出，老實說，這兩次公演，都給了我們一個很好的印象，我們看看一切人員的努力，與演出部份的成功，我們不能不看出上海劇藝社同人站在戲劇本位上的努力，與不可否認的功續　　至於觀眾們，　也許對上海劇藝社有更進一步的要求，就是希望劇藝社能夠更躍進一步的，上演幾　比較更進步的作品，雖然這也許是一種苛求，但我們認為，能夠向前看，對於一件事實當然總會有好處的，雖然我們也並不希望「盲動」或是「衝動」。　　當我看完社戲的時候，我馬上感覺，這裏面雖然包含著憤恨，但是他卻沒有反抗，這裏面雖然有罪惡與良心的爭鬥，但卻沒有對「哥哥的世界」提出否定與鬥爭。　　老實說，我是覺得這戲是太消沉了，就讓被統治階級者呻吟，呼號底，死在慘烈，酷刑的手下麼！　　因此，在客觀效果上我們必須否定這一種逃避，接受痛苦，軟弱無能的態度。　　演出部份，我們不能不承認，本劇導演吳仞之先生在處理手法上的成功。　　因為在這三幕悲劇裏，全劇出場人物祇有三個，而導演能夠在稀少的人物間，表示出它的情感與氣氛，這的確是不容易的。尤其是導演在許多部份，是連用了電影的手法，非常戲劇性的，雖然是沉默，幽思，也表現了它一個特殊的情調。　　比如第一幕裏，燈光是打得很好的，它用壁爐底下紅色反光射到演員臉部，使它發生一種陰沉恐怖的感覺；但是，對這一幕，我以為除了寫字枱，火爐的兩個光域以外，其餘部份的光線便太暗了一點，至少，我們不要使演員臉部發黑，而在這裏，我們們便看見章傑一次走到臺邊，一次靠近火爐倒酒，他的臉部便完全在黑暗中了。這一幕因為只有兩個人，雖然導演利用地位的活動，但仍不能減輕它沉重的感覺。　　第二幕：空氣比第幕緊張，演員的地位也活潑，但我以為燈光開亮以後，似乎太強烈了點。　　第三幕：效果都很好，男婦自殺前，一種相對沉默的情調，是非常優閏的。黑暗　場以後，因燈光沒有弄好了，使章傑在強烈燈光下燒信，失去了燈光的交果，這是必須糾正的　　演員：以我私人感覺都好；第一幕裏徐立的哭音應當慢慢減少；章傑很沉著：派頭，姿勢，都能工表這一人物的高傲；張婉君轉痛苦，她是一個好演員。　　徐立寫信時，以音調急烈的音樂，代表他心頭的紛亂，這是配得很好的。章遏雲之戲裝  （焦超攝）遊藝珍聞　　張大公昨日出殯　　話劇界巨子張大公擅演滑稽，為現隸卡爾登大戲院坤旦張慧聰之尊人，自兩年前脫離皇后後，突受重大刺激，致神經錯亂，竟成不治之症，纏綿迄今，醫藥　效，延至前日寅時，　而西歸，慧聰事親素孝，喉疾力愈，遭此變故，痛不欲生，昨日未時大殮出殯，送至江寧公所暫厝，慧聰母女扶棺悲哭，聞者莫不酸鼻。伶界話劇界同志前往執紼者，有王熙春母女，金素雯，劉文魁，王蘭芳，朱小樓，徐寒梅，宋癡僧，顧劍秋，秋雨聲，萬美艷等多人，慧聰有小可憐之號，一昨袁慟欲絕，尤覺其　　可憐矣。　　文素臣今日試音　　合眾影片公司，籌備全部文素臣，聘　旦王熙春，金素雯擔任女主角，文素臣已物色兩人，將擇其中之一，兩人姓名，當局尚嚴守秘密，對外不允宣佈，該公司定今日在徐家匯試音，王熙春，金素雯均往參加，惟兩男主角均病　啞，或展期舉行，亦未可知。　　聯友演血戰春風　　大世界聯友話劇社繼「未免有情」後之新劇，為朱炎編導之名劇血濺春風，准於二十一號夜場開演，尚有朱蕾瑛主編之新舊家庭，亦已脫稿，由導演朱炎開始排練，演出會當不遠。故都宮闈梨園秘史（一四八）  徐慕雲　　四進士劇中的人名多是有所取意的　　所以後來經宋士傑告發，把他問成死罪，鍘為三截，雖說他是被師爺所害，有啞叭吃黃蓮說不出的苦，然而要不是他作事糊塗，又怎能得此惡報呢？所以給他取名顧覩，主是責他糊塗的意思。　　知縣劉提，好酒貪杯，不理民詞，致有越衙告狀情事，因他尚無大惡，後來祇以革職了之。他既與劉伶同嗜，故而也取他個劉姓。　　至於河南巡按毛朋，他的行徑，是與田倫·顧覩·劉提·三位年兄大不相同的，不但為官清正，私訪民間疾苦，而且審理全案，很為明晰，昭雪了楊素貞的沉冤，真所謂無負國家的重托，堪為民之父母，給他取名「毛朋，」就是「莫朋」兩字的諧音，言他莫與田·顧·劉·三人朋比為奸的意思。又「毛」與「沒」音亦相近，謂他沒與國等朋比為奸，亦無不可，還有一說，他因為重視了國家的法度，同雙塔寺盟誓，故而三位同年犯罪，他均一一置之於法，絕不稍稍顧到朋友的私誼，如引也可以說他是只認得法律，就「沒」有了「朋」友，「沒朋」亦即「毛朋」的諧音。　　嚴格的講來，皮黃班的「四進士」還是從漢劇蛻化而來，而漢班裏演道　戲最負時望的，就要推老伶工余洪元了，上面這張「四進士」照像，就是他十年前所攝的。余洪元之宋士傑唸狀棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　對局　第二十法局　　黑先　　萬啓有（先）　謝俠遜　　着法　　砲二平五　砲八平五　馬二進三　馬八進七　車一平二　　車九進一　車二進六　車九平四　車二平三　馬二進三　　兵七進一　車四進七　馬八進九　砲五退一　砲八平七　　砲五平七　車三平四　相三進五　車九平八　車一平二　　車八進六　士四進五　兵三進一　砲二平一　車八平七　　馬三退一　士四進五　車二進四　車七平九　砲一平二　　兵九進一　車四退三　兵九進一　車二平八　車四退二　　車四平六　馬三進四　車八平六　馬四退六　砲二進四　　馬六進八　砲二平九　象三進一　砲九平八　砲五進四　　馬七進五　車九平五　車六平一　車五平二　砲八平七　　車二平一　車一平八　車一平四　車八進五　車四退六　　車八退二　象一退三　馬一進二　象三進五　車八退三　　兵五進一　砲七平五　兵七進一　相五進三　馬八進七　　相七進五　車四進三　車八進五　車四退三　車八退五　　兵五進一　馬二進三　砲七進一　馬三退五　馬七退五　　車八平五（和）</p>

<h3>Broadcast Address by Chairman Chiang: Implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization; The Greatness of Spiritual Strength Surpasses All Material Strengths; Completing the Two Major Responsibilities of Resistance and Nation-Building Together; Sincerely Examining Shortcomings; Rising Up United to Seek Self-Transformation; Shattering Attempts at Surrender and Humiliation; In Order to Enrich the National Spirit</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang held a solemn and serious National Covenant Oath Ceremony on the morning of the 17th, and delivered a broadcast address at 7 p.m. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, we are now implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. From the first of next month, all parts of our country must fully implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures promulgated by the Central Government on March 12th. We must hold National Monthly Meetings to swear the National Covenant, and we must also encourage and supervise each other according to the various regulations stipulated in the Outline, and put them into practice. Everyone must know that this is the most important thing related to the survival of the country, the vitality of the nation, and the success or failure of the War of Resistance. I ask all our countrymen, especially leaders from all walks of life, to pay special attention to this important matter and sincerely promote it. Why should we implement spiritual mobilization? This has been made very clear in the Outline. I want to reiterate in particular that, first, we must recognize the greatness of spiritual strength, which surpasses all material strength and all military force. Second, we must reflect on the shortcomings in our spiritual aspects in the past. What is spirit? Our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen put it most succinctly, saying, "All that is non-material is spirit." However, the Founding Father did not say that spirit and matter are absolutely separated, but that the two are united and complement each other. The Founding Father also said, "If mankind loses its spirit, it will not be a completely independent person." Think about it, what a shocking lesson this is! If an individual loses their spirit, they are not a completely independent person. Then, if a nation loses its spirit, wouldn't it be a nation unworthy of independent survival? Military strategy says, "Attacking the mind is the best strategy." The so-called attacking the mind is to strike at the opponent's spirit. Therefore, the success or failure of all struggles in the world depends entirely on the strength and weakness of the spirit. Tangible material or military force cannot determine victory or defeat. The Founding Father said that the use of weapons depends entirely on the spirit of the people, once said, "Compared with the two, spiritual power accounts for nine, and material power only accounts for one." All comrades who have participated in battles can cite countless examples to prove the accuracy and irrefutability of this posthumous teaching. We only need to look at our front lines since the War of Resistance, where there are often less than a few soldiers who can resist a large number of enemies for several days, and even repel enemies more than ten times their number. There are also old and weak women who can resist violence and kill enemies in self-defense with their bare hands. Many things that are usually considered unimaginable or impossible can become facts beyond expectation in times of difficulty and crisis. Therefore, only those who have lost their spirit will only see matter and not spirit, only estimate tangible power and ignore intangible power. In fact, to win this war of resistance, to defeat the enemy, and to build a successful nation, a large part depends on the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, arduous, and dangerous our environment will inevitably become. We must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to seek final success. Therefore, at this critical juncture of life and death, our compatriots must recognize the greatness of spiritual strength. This is the first point I want to make clear. Secondly, we must ask whether we have had any effect, development, and progress in spirit since the War of Resistance, and whether there are still many shortcomings. Speaking of this, I want to remind our compatriots of an old saying from more than a year ago. It was when our War of Resistance had just begun for less than two or three months. At that time, foreign public opinion had various criticisms of our country. Among them, there was an extremely shocking comment, saying that "China is not strong enough to resist external forces, either in spirit or in material." I don't know if our compatriots still remember this sentence. I personally keep this sentence in my heart every day, warning and encouraging myself, and never forgetting it for a moment. Is this sentence an insult to us? We must wait for the future to prove it with facts. Of course, we have already shown many heroic and struggling deeds in the War of Resistance. But compatriots must remember that the war is not over, the enemy has not been defeated, and final victory has not been achieved. We must honestly and sincerely examine ourselves. Has our national spirit really made solid progress with the progress of the war? Have our past shortcomings been washed away in the War of Resistance? Have we, the people with responsibilities, fulfilled our responsibilities? Have the capable people done their best? Has everyone's life been consistently serious and tense? Have our front and rear areas truly achieved a unified response and shared weal and woe? Have our thoughts, words, and actions been completely gathered under the goal of "the nation above all, the nation above all, military first, and victory first"? Have we achieved consistency between what we say and what we do? Can we all consistently carry out our generous and enthusiastic anti-Japanese spirit from beginning to end, consistently through thick and thin? Can we absolutely not waver, not seize, not deceive, and not be false? Furthermore, can our confidence in the War of Resistance and nation-building be accepted and understood by every citizen? Can we make the enemy and the general puppet traitors recognize that our national spirit is inviolable? Has the general social way of life practically met the conditions of wartime life? I know that if compatriots think about themselves and look at the society around them, they will inevitably feel that it is necessary for us to be extra vigilant, extra invigorated, and extra mutual encouragement and supervision. If a country has material defects, there is no way to fill them in a short time, and it cannot be regarded as the shame of this country, because the production of materials requires manpower, material resources, especially time, and various conditions, which cannot be supplemented in a moment. As for spiritual defects, it is different. With spirit, one share of material can be used as ten shares of material, and it can also create a large amount of material. Without spirit, as the Founding Father said, "The human body becomes a dead thing." No matter how many weapons and materials you have, it will all be useless. Moreover, spirit is not comparable to material. Spirit is inherent in every citizen. It is not external. It can be improved and improved through methods of enlightenment and induction, in the transfer of a single thought. If a country suffers foreign aggression due to the decline of its spirit, it is already the incomparable shame of this generation of citizens. If, in times of crisis and survival, we still cannot concentrate our spirit, household by household, father exhorting brother, to defend our country and nation, overcome the current difficulties, and open up the future destiny, then it is not only the shame of this generation of citizens, but simply a sin, because this is the so-called "not that we cannot do it, but that we do not do it." There is no reason to forgive ourselves. We must know that if we win the War of Resistance and build a successful nation, the destiny of the Chinese nation for thousands of years will not be broken, and we will certainly have the confidence to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. On the contrary, if the country loses its independent survival because our generation does not have a vigorous, strong, and unyielding spirit, then later historians will not know how severely they will criticize us when recording the history of this period. The general public will of course suffer from being贬百世, and leaders and intellectuals from all walks of life with higher knowledge, ability, and status will not be able to escape the blame of historians. Now the War of Resistance has entered the second stage. This is our last chance for victory, and it is also our citizens' last chance to serve the country and redeem themselves. That is why, in the midst of extremely busy military and political affairs, I advocate the National Spiritual Mobilization, which is to give our compatriots, especially leaders from all walks of life, a final opportunity to repay the country. The items and key points included in the spiritual mobilization have been listed in several points, and there are also points that are not listed in the Outline. Everyone can draw inferences from one instance. In order to promote this movement universally, the first step is to hold monthly meetings and swear the National Covenant. When everyone holds the meeting, they must not do it in the manner of following the old rules. You must know that these simple twelve articles are our weapons for resisting and defeating the enemy. We must have the spirit of not being afraid of death, not being afraid of hardship, and not being afraid of difficulty to implement them. For example, we say that we will not do anything for the enemy and traitors. If there is any force to coerce us, we will only refuse to break our oath even if we die. Also, if we say that we will not violate the Three Principles of the People and the interests of the country and the nation, if there is any external coercion or temptation to make us violate the Three Principles of the People, or do something that violates the interests of the country and the nation, we should also grit our teeth and refuse to break our oath even if we die, and we will not break our oath even if we suffer any pain. Our situation today can be said that the entire nation has stepped onto the glorious line of turning over, and every citizen must consider themselves standing on the line of certain death, just as the ancients said, "Keep in mind that you can die at any time, and seek survival in every step you take." Every move we make, every drop of sweat, every drop of blood, must be used at any time and anywhere to seek the glorious and independent survival of the country and the nation. But what do we rely on to fight? We need the determination to die for ourselves. If everyone has the determination to die at any time, there is no doubt that the enemy will collapse in front of us, and the noble spirit of the Chinese nation can be universally developed and achieve the certain victory of the War of Resistance and the certain success of nation-building. Regarding the essence of spiritual mobilization, what I want to say is really endless for a while. The oath-taking section mentioned above is a basic starting point. I earnestly ask every one of our compatriots to stick to the common goal of "the nation above all, the nation above all, military first, and victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," and earnestly restore our nation's inherent morality, and strengthen our spiritual fortress. A person must be loyal to the country, filial to the nation, benevolent to suffering compatriots, faithful to all mankind, and do everything in his power to strive for true and lasting peace in this turbulent and dim world. I also ask our compatriots to understand that the War of Resistance is for nation-building, and the two major responsibilities must be completed together. Therefore, we must deeply repent of the past mistakes of not sincerely believing in the Three Principles of the People, and from now on, we must establish our national faith in the Three Principles of the People and sincerely seek its realization. The most basic point is that our compatriots, from old age to youth, must have ardent confidence in the bright future of the nation. We must confirm that the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People established after the victory of the War of Resistance must be a new country that comes from behind, a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed country, and the most thoroughly progressive country that can contribute to the well-being of the world and mankind. Now is the period of fierce resistance, a moment of great importance, and we cannot allow ourselves to make any more empty theories or empty thoughts, nor can we waste a single moment of time and energy. We should aim at the current strong enemy, face the country's difficulties, seriously reflect on our responsibilities, and sincerely examine all our shortcomings and weaknesses. On the one hand, we must quickly and surely transform ourselves, set an example, and at the same time inspire our compatriots across the country, help our compatriots who have not yet awakened, awaken our compatriots who generally have lower levels of knowledge, rise up together, correct the life of drunkenness and self-abandonment, develop a vigorous and enterprising spirit, eliminate the habit of苟且偷生 and陽奉陰達, break the attempts of selfishness and submission, correct the divergent and mixed thoughts that mislead the country and oneself, tighten our emotions, and unify our actions, so that the spirit of our Chinese nation can be enriched and concentrated, and truly achieve the spiritual mobilization of the whole country, and exert this (至大至剛) spiritual strength to complete our generation's mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future, our dear compatriots, I hope everyone will fight for the country and cherish the country. Goodbye. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Spiritual Mobilization and Shanghai Citizens</h3>
<p>From yesterday until the 23rd of this month, all provinces and cities in China are holding a National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, and today also happens to be Citizens' Propaganda Day. At the present time when China's War of Resistance is gradually entering a new stage, and when the Japanese army is feeling increasingly difficult in its military operations against China and is attempting to use various conspiratorial methods to shake China's War of Resistance, this great National Spiritual Movement has profound and significant meaning.</p>
<p>The National Spiritual Mobilization Outline was passed by the Fifth Plenary Session of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Third Session of the National Political Consultative Conference, and promulgated by the Central Government. It stipulates the National Covenant, which all citizens of the country must swear to abide by; and it stipulates that from the first day of next month, all organizations and institutions across the country should hold National Monthly Meetings every month to review whether everyone can strictly abide by the National Covenant, and whether they can faithfully fulfill the Outline of Spiritual Mobilization. This movement is by no means only of negative significance, but of positive effect; this movement is by no means just a "boilerplate" that is only in form, but has substantial content, and is a major task that every patriotic citizen must perform. We must know that today, as the War of Resistance enters a new stage, although the prospect of China's victory is getting closer day by day, the difficulties encountered by China will inevitably deepen and expand day by day. Because the Japanese warlords, seeing the hopelessness of their military operations against China, will certainly use all the most vicious conspiracies to shake the will of the Chinese people, threaten the spirit of the Chinese people, and divide the unity of the Chinese people, in order to fundamentally destroy China's War of Resistance. To achieve victory, China must first overcome all these difficulties, and must work together to build a strong spiritual fortress, temper its struggle, and crush all kinds of conspiracies by Japanese imperialism to destroy China's War of Resistance. Chairman Chiang said it well: "Recently, the enemy has been focusing on political maneuvers, fabricating facts, and alienating the Chinese people, all in order to first subdue our spirit and decompose our spirit... To break this conspiracy,... we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance, and not only mobilize all the materials and manpower in the country, but also mobilize the spirit and will of the whole country, and not only launch the spirit of the whole country, but also organize the spirit that has been launched, use organized spirit to exert organized manpower, and use organized materials, so that we can sweep away the invading strong enemy and establish a permanent foundation for nation-building after the war."</p>
<p>Although Shanghai has become an "isolated island," none of the four million Shanghai citizens who do not want to be slaves do not think about the future of the motherland day and night, and none do not want to do their part for the country and the nation. On this day of holding the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week, the citizens of Shanghai will certainly temper themselves and strive even harder, and enthusiastically shoulder the responsibilities in their own positions. Now, taking this opportunity, we especially point out the two most urgent and important tasks at this time and place, hoping that the citizens of Shanghai will earnestly and actively carry them out:</p>
<p>The first task that Shanghai citizens should undertake is to completely eradicate the activities of traitorous and rebellious elements. As the Shanghai Spiritual Mobilization Association said in its "Letter to Compatriots": "Because the enemy's military invasion has failed, it has turned to developing political conspiracies, using a small number of national scum to attempt to shake our overall War of Resistance. Wang Jingwei... has colluded with the enemy country and openly sought surrender... and secretly sent his henchmen to Shanghai to stir up trouble." Yes, today's Shanghai has indeed become the center of the Japanese military intelligence agencies and the conspiratorial activities of pro-Japanese traitors. In any case, their evil hands are almost always lurking. For example, the pro-Japanese lackeys Zhou Fohai and others are already active in Shanghai's educational circles, and the dissemination of insulting leaders and alienating unity by the pro-Japanese organ "Protest" and other traitorous arguments deserve close attention. Every patriotic Shanghai citizen must work together to eliminate this traitorous theory and eradicate the activities of this group of national scum!</p>
<p>Secondly, from today onwards, Shanghai citizens must also thoroughly strive to improve their own lives. It is undeniable that since Shanghai became an isolated island, some people, due to inner烦闷, or due to the temptation of external evil forces, often indulge in the pursuit of 声色犬馬, so that their will becomes increasingly decadent and their lives become increasingly corrupt. This is indeed a serious crisis. To be honest, the reason why China cannot be conquered is that the hearts of the Chinese people cannot be conquered. If the Chinese people indulge in corrupt lives day and night, and their spirit becomes increasingly decadent, wouldn't that be falling into the trap of others? It must be known that gambling dens are no different from devil's dens, and opium pipes are equivalent to handguns, which are the most vicious weapons used by the Japanese army and traitors to harm and kill the Chinese people. The citizens of Shanghai, if they are addicted to this aspect, must thoroughly correct it from today onwards, or widely persuade others to correct it, which is the second most urgent task.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Xiangdian: Xue Yue discussed the future of the Hunan-Jiangxi war situation yesterday, saying that the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi has been continuously attacked from the front and rear near Gao'an and Wuning, so they cannot advance beyond Xiushui. In recent days, the Japanese troops on all routes have stopped attacking, reduced the battlefield, and built fortifications in various strongholds to hold on. A portion of their main force is moving north. According to my observation, this temporary lull is actually a time for the Japanese army to reconsider a major invasion.

<h3>Central Government Reorganizes Xikang's Monetary System</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Xikang is now being built as a Chinese province, and its politics are gradually getting on track. However, its monetary system seems to be still chaotic and has not been affected by the 1935 Chinese legal tender reform. This is because China's land is too vast, and the implementation of new policies cannot but take some time. It is said that within Xikang Province, legal tender seems to be still a new arrival from outside, and the people are generally curious about it. At present, the currencies in general circulation in Xikang Province include legal tender, silver coins, Tibetan coins, Tibetan banknotes, nickel coins, and also copper coins. However, in open areas, the implementation of legal tender is very widespread, and the central government has also absorbed a lot of silver coins and Tibetan coins here, in accordance with the principle of state ownership of silver. The current difficulty in Xikang's monetary system lies in the large number of Tibetan banknotes, and it is difficult to find a way to absorb them in a short time. It is said that some of these Tibetan banknotes were issued by the Tibetan government, and some were issued by the Sichuan government. The forms are inconsistent and the reserves are lacking. As for Tibetan coins, they are silver coins, with a percentage of 70% silver and 30% copper. The central government is gradually absorbing them with legal tender as consideration.

<h3>US Fleet Concentrates in the Pacific, Said to Prevent Japan from Coveting Hong Kong. Pittman Reissues Powerful Remarks to Boycott Japanese Goods and Make Them Respect Treaties.</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman praised President Roosevelt's plan for world peace yesterday and predicted that "any dictator or any dictatorial government" would inevitably perish. In addition, Pittman asked the United States to take strict measures against Japan to force it to respect U.S. interests in the Far East. Pittman's remarks last night were broadcast nationwide by radio. Pittman argued that the "cash and carry" clause stipulated in the current Neutrality Act must be strictly observed so as not to be involved in the whirlpool of a second world war. "But in the current environment, authorize the president to impose restrictions on trade with Japan, in order to force Japan to stop its destruction of international treaties, or at least require Japan to provide guarantees to end its destruction of treaties in a reasonable period of time." It is noteworthy that Pittman has made remarks advocating sanctions against Japan in order to make it respect U.S. interests in the Far East twice within a week. Secondly, Pittman is often a spokesman for the U.S. government's foreign policy. Thirdly, Pittman's remarks this time were made at the same time as the U.S. Navy's recall to the Pacific. According to Pittman yesterday, "Since the beginning of history, dictators have appeared repeatedly, but they have all perished quickly." Therefore, according to Pittman's prediction, the fate of the current dictators will not be long. (Associated Press dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Democratic Senator William King today, the sudden return of the U.S. Navy to the Pacific is aimed at preventing Japan from coveting the Philippines or the Dutch East Indies when the European situation is tense. The meaning of the U.S. fleet's move is "to warn Japan that the U.S. is still a powerful country in the Pacific. If Japan takes any further action, it will inevitably clash with us." "Informed sources here cannot say whether Japan has plans to expand the war zone, but they all regard the Sino-Japanese War as a "political volcano." The majority of authorities believe that Japan's second target of attack is Hong Kong, but the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific can make Japan restrain its ambitions and dare not launch lightly. (Associated Press dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times' Washington dispatch, discussing the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific, said that the U.S. naval authorities, when planning, considered the impact of this move on the strategically important distribution in the history of the world's fleets, and the transportation of important military supplies, such as rubber and tin, to the United States. This decision has prevented the U.S. fleet from realizing its plan to participate in the official opening ceremony of the New York World's Fair. In the future, after the ships that are transferred pass through the Panama Canal, 270 of the 357 U.S. battleships will be distributed in the Pacific. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) President Roosevelt's telegram to the two dictators in Europe and U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson's order to transfer 64 warships from the Atlantic back to the Pacific have greatly surprised the naval circles here. They believe that Japan-U.S. relations have recently improved and there is no need for this move. The general public also believes that at a time when the European situation is tense, the U.S. fleet needs to be stationed entirely in the Atlantic. It is not known why it is being transferred back to the Pacific. Japanese newspapers have not criticized the recent actions of the United States. The Navy Ministry is currently unwilling to make any comments hastily. (Reuters dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>China and Germany Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, China has recently signed a barter trade agreement with the German government, stipulating that Germany can exchange industrial products for China's mineral products, up to 10 million Chinese currency per month. Economic circles here were very pleased to hear about this, saying that the trade volume between the two sides will increase significantly from now on. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<h3>Hitler to Respond to Roosevelt's Proposal on the 28th; Summons Parliament to Issue Declaration on That Day After Extensive Consideration with Mussolini</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The government has just released a bulletin stating, "Fuehrer Hitler has received a telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt, requesting a clear stance on certain matters. The Fuehrer is taking this very seriously and has decided to summon the Reichstag to convene on the 28th of this month and issue a declaration on behalf of the German nation in response to President Roosevelt." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to impressions from political circles, Hitler may offer some answers to President Roosevelt, not ending the matter with an absolute "no." Instead, he might attribute the responsibility for the current international situation to the Soviet Union and various democracies. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Diplomatic circles here recently announced that, prior to deciding to convene the Reichstag on the 28th of this month, Fuehrer Hitler had informed the Italian government. When the Reichstag convenes, the attitude expressed by Fuehrer Hitler will undoubtedly be fully endorsed by Italy. Generally speaking, the nature of the Fuehrer's declaration in response to President Roosevelt's telegram, while negative, may not be as extreme as generally anticipated. In other words, on issues such as colonies, raw material supply, and the development of German overseas trade, the door to negotiations may not be completely shut. However, Roosevelt's accusation that the totalitarian states intend to invade other countries will be denied. Hitler will declare that he has proposed arms limitations and will ultimately criticize the encirclement policy of Western European countries. He will also deny President Roosevelt's right to interfere in European affairs. The content of the declaration is complex and significant, and the speech is expected to last three hours. At that time, it will be broadcast nationwide by various radio stations. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Munich Fuehrer Hitler met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for one and a half hours this afternoon to discuss U.S. President Roosevelt's telegram and Hitler's reply. After exchanging views with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the reply will be sent. The content of the reply is said to be clear and understandable. It is not yet known whether it will be sent before the Fuehrer's 50th birthday on the 20th of this month. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler is not in a hurry to reply to President Roosevelt's appeal for peace. This afternoon, he held a discussion with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich for about two hours and maintained close contact with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini throughout the day. It is reported that Hitler also spoke with General Goering, who is currently in Rome, on the phone for a long time. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) German Aviation Minister General Goering visited Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia this afternoon for a lengthy discussion. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. It is reported that the discussion focused on President Roosevelt's telegram. Another report states that General Goering discussed important issues directly related to Italy and Germany with the Prime Minister and is scheduled to return to Berlin tomorrow afternoon. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's Washington dispatch states that President Roosevelt's appeal to the German and Italian authorities is supported by people across the United States. A small number of American writers, who have long believed that negotiations with dictators are futile, are now denouncing the President's "appeasement policy." Others accuse the President of interfering in matters unrelated to the United States. However, the general response from newspapers and Congress, as well as letters and telegrams received by the White House, all express agreement with the President. Therefore, the authorities are greatly pleased to see this expression of national support for abandoning isolationism. Senator Nye, who participated in the original draft of the U.S. Neutrality Act, recently stated, "It is refreshing to see this effort made at this time." Although news from Rome and Berlin is not very promising, the U.S. authorities are not discouraged because they know that a positive response is unlikely in the short term. However, they hope that after repeated consideration, the dictators will not completely close the door. The U.S. authorities also believe that even if this action is ineffective, it is still a necessary move so that there can be no doubt as to who is responsible if a global catastrophe occurs.

<h3>Roosevelt's Appeal for Peace Receives Endorsement from Various Countries; Will Germany and Italy Willingly Be the Leaders of War? The President's Telegram Is a Touchstone.</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt, stating, "I have read your lofty counsel to the governments of Germany and Italy with great admiration and sympathy. The people of the Soviet Socialist Federation, who faithfully and sincerely desire to safeguard peace, wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support your initiative." (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding President Roosevelt's telegram to German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the State Department has received many replies from various countries. All Latin American countries, except Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, and Paraguay, have sent replies expressing their support. The Canadian government has also sent a telegram expressing admiration. Brazilian President Vargas telegraphed President Roosevelt, stating, "Your actions are worthy of the leader of the American continent. Your words have resonated in our country. I hereby send this telegram on behalf of my government to offer congratulations." At the same time, Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha told U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Scott, "President Roosevelt's telegram completely matches the views and desires of the Brazilian government and people. Therefore, the entire nation expresses its support." Cuban President Bru sent a telegram stating, "After reading it, our government is filled with admiration. Your Excellency, the President, is indeed worthy of being a renowned statesman. I hereby represent the people of the nation to publicly express the solidarity between our two countries." Mexican Foreign Minister Hay told U.S. Ambassador Daniels, "This telegram is worthy of being written by a great man. Our President Cárdenas has unlimited sympathy for President Roosevelt's outstanding sentiments." Peruvian President Benavides telegraphed, stating, "Your Excellency's aspirations are in complete agreement with our country." Uruguayan Foreign Minister Espalter telegraphed, stating, "I have been ordered by our President Terra to send this telegram to offer congratulations. In these days of extreme international crisis, Your Excellency's call will undoubtedly win the sympathy of the world." Chilean Foreign Minister Ortega telegraphed, stating, "On behalf of President Aguirre, I respectfully extend my congratulations to Your Excellency. Your telegram has made a deep impression in our country." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin Arrive in Canada and Highly Praise Roosevelt</h3>
<p>St. John, Canada Former British Prime Minister Lord Baldwin and his wife arrived here yesterday aboard the "Duchess of York" mail ship. They immediately made a statement to the press, saying that U.S. President Roosevelt's recent telegram to German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was a courageous move by a great statesman, and I sincerely hope for its success. "It takes great courage to do something that is known to be impossible, even at the risk of failure. Because of its superior geographical and historical position, the United States is uniquely able to deal with European political affairs in an objective manner without bias. The only country that can launch a large-scale peace movement at this time is Italy alone." When a reporter asked whether Canada would participate in a world war if one were to occur in the future, Baldwin immediately replied, "There is no doubt that each part of the British Empire will fulfill its responsibilities." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Reviews Troops in Austria</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Fuehrer Hitler arrived in St. Pölten, southern Austria, from Munich this morning. After being welcomed by Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch, he accompanied him to inspect the stationed troops and observe exercises. Responsible officials here stated that Fuehrer Hitler's trip had been planned long ago and was intended to inspect the extent to which the troops stationed in Austria were prepared. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Insightful Views from British and American Newspapers on the Value of Roosevelt's Telegram</h3>
<p>(London) The majority opinion of British newspaper commentators is that President Roosevelt's gesture towards Germany and Italy, even if it does not elicit a satisfactory response from them, still has great value. Judging from the uneasy news from Munich, it is clear that Germany may not rudely reject the U.S. President's peace proposal. At the same time, negotiations to bring various countries into the European defense system are making significant progress and will become increasingly developed in the new atmosphere created by the U.S. President. The Daily Telegraph stated that the U.S. President's appeal, whether it receives a satisfactory response or not, will definitely have a significant effect on the course of events. President Roosevelt, seeing the impending catastrophe, made this appeal. Even if it fails to avert the global catastrophe, it has made an invaluable contribution to world civilization by focusing world opinion on the sordid realities of the current crisis. The News Chronicle stated that the United States has immediately changed the situation with its legitimate action of intervening in international affairs. After this telegram is sent, the situation will either improve or rapidly deteriorate; it cannot remain as it was. The Daily Herald stated that every British family, upon seeing this appeal, is filled with admiration for President Roosevelt, regarding him as one of their own leaders. What did not exist a month ago is now gradually emerging, namely, a grand alliance against aggression. If the dictators underestimate the force of the united defense that they have created, they will make a grave mistake that they will regret because this force is sufficient to extinguish the dictators. The U.S. President's telegram is tantamount to saying that if Germany and Italy insist on waging war against the world, then dozens of countries around the world, including the United States, will rise up to resist them. The Manchester Guardian stated that the U.S. President may not expect Germany and Italy to accept his appeal and added that the obstacles that Britain is currently creating, if assisted by all parties, can definitely prevent dictators from lightly starting a war. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times stated that the biggest question for the German and Italian people is whether they have the power to move their leaders with their urgent aspirations, which are no less than those of other nations. British policy has never precluded peaceful discussion, but it is determined to cultivate its strength to achieve the goal of peaceful discussion, which is gradually becoming easier and moving forward. Today, it has reached the stage where Britain and President Roosevelt have jointly declared that their advocacy of peace does not stem from fear or cowardice. In the past few weeks, Britain has undertaken arduous obligations in Europe and is aware of the heavy responsibilities it bears, but it has never complained. Today, the tension in the situation has temporarily eased as a result, giving President Roosevelt the opportunity to appeal for peace, and this statement is not entirely unreasonable. In fact, the British character often resonates with American public opinion, namely, strength and courage. Both Britain and the United States possess this character. After President Roosevelt's telegram was issued, the British government quickly welcomed it, and almost everyone here is in sympathy with the government. The Daily Mail stated that if we relax our defenses because we believe that the German and Italian responses will be satisfactory, then nothing could be more destructive to President Roosevelt's purpose. The U.S. President's appeal may cause the dictators to pause, but it may not cause them to abandon the politics of force. If this goal is to be achieved, there is no other way than through the armed forces of the democracies. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's telegram to German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is being praised by newspapers here. It is generally said that Hitler and Mussolini may not give satisfactory replies, but the resistance policies of Britain and France can thus be strengthened. The New York Times wrote, "Even if the President's actions do not achieve the desired results, they should not be regarded as a failure, because the President's intention is to point out who the aggressor is before the outbreak of war so that world public opinion will sympathize with the victim." President’s actions, kill two birds with one stone. The New York Post stated that the President's telegram has three effects: one, it points out the policies pursued by the recipients of the telegram; two, it provides diplomatic support for the alliance between Britain and France; and three, it warns the Rome-Berlin axis.

<h3>Turmoil in the Mediterranean; Thirteen French Warships Arrive at the Gibraltar Naval Base; British Troops Reinforce Egypt and Other Places; Spanish Troops Scheduled to Enter Madrid</h3>
<p>(London) The Times' diplomatic correspondent states that Britain is closely monitoring developments in the Mediterranean and Spain in conjunction with France. The transfer of British troops from Palestine to Egypt and the dispatch of the Welsh Guards to Gibraltar are all signs of Britain's preparations for contingencies. There is confirmed evidence that a large number of German weapons have recently been transported to naval bases and airfields on the northwestern coast of Spain, and reports of Italian troop movements in Spain are also being closely studied by the British authorities. It is particularly questionable when the Italian troops will hold their triumphal march into Madrid. It was initially heard that it would be held on April 20, then changed to May 2, and now postponed to May 15. The repeated postponements are clearly viewed with great dissatisfaction by the British government. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar After two French battleships arrived in the port yesterday, three more cruisers, namely the Marseillaise, the La Galissonnière, and the Jean de Vienne, and six destroyers, namely the Volta, the Mogador, the Audacieux, the Ouragan, the Le Hardi, and the Simoun, under the respective command of French Vice-Admiral Marquis and Rear-Admiral Lacroix, arrived one after another today. In total, there are thirteen ships. At the same time, the Spanish destroyer Soidelou has also arrived at the nearby port of Algeciras. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar The French battleships Lorraine and Bretagne, and the destroyers Foudroyant and L'Indomptable, arrived off this port this morning. However, due to the presence of a lock in the port, they were unable to enter and anchored near South Mole. It is not known how long they plan to stay. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar Among the two French destroyers, one called Le Terrible is the fastest destroyer in the world, having reached a speed of 45.25 knots during sea trials. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar The number of French warships, large and small, that arrived at this port yesterday and today totaled thirteen. Among them, the two battleships Lorraine and Bretagne each have a tonnage of 20,500 tons and a range of over 10,000 kilometers, equipped with ten or eight 13.5-inch guns, respectively. The three cruisers each have a tonnage of 7,600 tons. The three destroyers Foudroyant, L'Indomptable, and Audacieux each have a tonnage of 2,600 tons and a range of 4,000 kilometers. The two destroyers Volta and Mogador each have a tonnage of 2,880 tons and a range of 5,000 kilometers. All of these destroyers are very fast, especially the Foudroyant, which has an average speed of 45 knots per hour. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Dar es Salaam, Africa One company of the 6th Battalion of the African Rifles has been ordered to proceed to the Tanga estuary near the Kenya border. There has been no disturbance in that area, but there are many Germans residing nearby. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from the international neutral zone of Tangier this morning, approximately 12,000 Spanish troops are concentrated in the vicinity of the border, reportedly preparing to proceed to Spanish Morocco. Residents of Tangier are uneasy about the concentration of a large number of Spanish troops. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid Official sources here have announced that the Nationalist Army is scheduled to triumphantly enter the city on May 15. The participating units include approximately 150,000 soldiers from the domestic army and air force, as well as foreign troops. Generalissimo Franco will deliver an important speech at that time. Afterwards, the foreign troops will be evacuated through the ports of Cadiz and Almeria, while the domestic troops will be demobilized gradually starting in the second half of May. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Seville General Franco, accompanied by his staff, arrived here yesterday from Burgos. Security was very tight along the way, and the visit was not announced in advance.

Yesterday's agricultural celebrations included special religious processions and a grand bullfight. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Vatican City Today, the Pope delivered a broadcast speech in Spanish, praising the noble courage of the Spanish people and congratulating their leaders on their steadfast defense of Christian civilization and their victory over communism and atheism.

<h3>Expanded British-Soviet Negotiations; Soviet Ambassador to Return Home for Instructions; French Negotiations with Russia and Turkey Also Active</h3>
<p>(Paris) After U.S. President Roosevelt telegraphed German Fuehrer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the general public is closely watching the consequences. The efforts of the British and French governments to organize a collective security system are not being relaxed as a result, and they are still actively negotiating with the Soviet Union and Turkey today, hoping that these countries will join. It is reported that this goal can be achieved within a short period of time. Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Turkish Ambassador Menemencioglu this afternoon, and it is reported that the talks have made good progress. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also met with British Ambassador Seeds and French Chargé d'Affaires Payart this afternoon. It is reported that the negotiations have entered the decisive stage. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to hold important talks with Soviet Ambassador Suritz tomorrow. The frequency of contacts between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Turkey is evident from this. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with Foreign Office Undersecretary Sir Alexander Cadogan this morning and is scheduled to return to Moscow this afternoon or tomorrow to inform his government of the British authorities' views in detail so that British Ambassador Seeds' contacts with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will be further enhanced. According to informed sources in political circles here, the two countries originally intended to conclude a Sky Agreement, but now they will expand its scope. There are three reasons for this: (1) Britain has provided guarantees to Poland and Romania and will provide a guarantee to Turkey in the near future. All of these actions directly benefit the security of the Soviet Union's western border, so it is difficult to ask the Soviet Union to provide guarantees to Romania. It is reported that the Soviet government has verbally agreed to do so. (2) Britain and the Soviet Union have agreed on a general mutual assistance agreement, the nature of which is similar to a military alliance treaty, which may be announced this week. (3) Efforts should be made to concretize the existing Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. The two sides are currently holding technical talks, and the British government has been informed of the progress at all times. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign Minister Litvinov met with British Ambassador Seeds this afternoon for half an hour. British and Soviet officials have refused to disclose the content of the talks. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Multiple German Aircraft Invade Polish Airspace; Polish Authorities Prepare to Shoot Them Down</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, for several days, multiple German aircraft have flown into Polish airspace along the border of the country, especially the border of Pomerania Province. In addition to protesting to Germany, the Polish government has instructed the border defense authorities to open fire with anti-aircraft guns if similar incidents occur. So far, no incidents have occurred. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the proposals made by the German government to Poland, Polish Ambassador Lipski returned to his country on the 14th of this month for instructions and has since returned to his post but has not yet held talks with German diplomatic authorities. Political circles here are surprised by this. The Polish Embassy states that Poland's views were communicated to the German government more than a month ago, before Polish Foreign Minister Beck consulted with Britain, so there is no need to explain them again. German Ambassador to Poland Moltke is currently on vacation in Silesia Province and may return home on the 20th of this month, the birthday of Fuehrer Hitler, to offer congratulations and discuss relations between Germany and Poland. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Minister Meets with Romanian Foreign Minister; Talks in Car for One and a Half Hours</h3>
<p>Kraków, Poland Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who is on his way to consult with Germany, passed through here at 11:00 this morning. Foreign Minister Beck specially rushed over from Warsaw to meet him and accompanied him to the city of Katowice. The important talks took place during this one-and-a-half-hour journey. It is reported that the discussion focused on what attitude Poland and Romania should take towards the Soviet Union when Britain, France, and the Soviet Union establish a mutual assistance pact (note that France and the Soviet Union have already signed a mutual assistance agreement). Polish officials originally opposed the idea of Soviet troops passing through Polish territory, but now they are relatively flexible. That is, if a war breaks out in Europe in the future, and Poland and the Soviet Union are on the same side against Germany, and if the Soviet Union provides assistance to Western European countries, then Poland will allow Soviet aircraft to fly into its airspace. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Foreign Minister Beck held talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu on the train between Kraków and Katowice for an hour and a half. After arriving in Katowice, he said goodbye to Foreign Minister Gafencu. This matter is highly valued by political circles here, who believe that these talks must have a major relationship with Poland and Romania conducting negotiations with Hungary in the future. In addition, Foreign Minister Beck met with Governor Grażyński of Upper Silesia in Katowice to hear a report on the issues between Germans and Poles in the province. This is also valued by political circles because Germany regards Grażyński as the mortal enemy of the Third Reich. His policies towards the German population in Upper Silesia often conflict with the policies of the Polish government. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Dispute Occurs on the German-Swiss Border</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland A border dispute occurred on the border between Switzerland and Germany today. Several German customs officials pointed to a uniformed Swiss border guard and accused him of entering German territory and tried to arrest him. Many Swiss citizens, who happened to be there celebrating Civil Aviation Day, opposed it. According to reports, one German customs official fired a shot, but fortunately no one was injured. The local authorities have reported the incident to the Federal Government. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Australian Navy Conducts Large-Scale Maneuvers, First Since the European War</h3>
<p>Sydney: Today marks the beginning of the largest Australian naval maneuvers since the European war, scheduled to continue until Wednesday. The flagship HMAS Sydney, along with Air Force Squadron No. 8, are cooperating in this exercise, striving to simulate wartime conditions for all ships. Passing merchant vessels are being intercepted and interrogated. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>US Warship Returns Saito's Ashes, Japanese Overwhelmed with Gratitude</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The American warship USS Astoria, carrying the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito, arrived in Yokohama at 8:10 AM today. A squadron of Japanese destroyers escorted it into port, all ships flying flags at half-mast. The USS Astoria and a Japanese destroyer exchanged a 21-gun salute. 15,000 people welcomed the ship. A special train transported the ashes to Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to bury the ashes tomorrow according to Buddhist rites. The Emperor today sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, expressing gratitude for the American warship's gesture. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese newspapers have paid far more attention to the USS Astoria's return of Ambassador Saito's ashes than to President Roosevelt's appeal or the dispatch of 64 American warships to the Pacific. Many newspapers' editorials welcomed the American warship's arrival this morning. The Jiji Shinpo newspaper group praised the warship's carrying of the ashes as the "posthumous diplomatic achievement" of the late ambassador in promoting Japanese-American friendship. The newspapers also emphasized the special honor given to the late ambassador by President Roosevelt and expressed hope that the officers and crew of the USS Astoria would carry back with them the Japanese people's respect and memory of America. The Jiji Shinpo editorial earnestly hoped that the Pacific would live up to its name and achieve lasting peace, with the national fortunes of Japan and the United States thriving day by day, each shouldering a part of the responsibility for maintaining world peace. The Kokumin Shimbun editorial stated that President Roosevelt's appeal to Hitler and Mussolini was at best only a "telegram war" and would not greatly affect the overall world situation. The newspaper observed that President Roosevelt's involvement in the Chinese situation contradicted his own policies if he refused to recognize the already established facts in East Asia. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Ireland Desires to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Dublin: The President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic, Eamon de Valera, delivered a speech in Ennis this afternoon, expressing agreement with the telegram sent by US President Roosevelt yesterday. However, he stated that in the current situation, it seemed that only the power of God could prevent war in Europe. Under such circumstances, the Republican government should strive to maintain a neutral position to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Finally, he advocated that the issue of the unification and independence of Northern and Southern Ireland should be resolved in a friendly manner. He said, "Today, all countries are actively preparing for war, and all concepts of international law and justice have been put aside. 'The era of international agreements, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, has passed. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide do not want to kill each other and firmly believe that they should not. Is it too late to ask all the countries concerned, namely those that will inevitably participate in the war in the future, to hold a meeting before the outbreak of war in order to turn swords into ploughshares? President Roosevelt spoke out of righteousness and asked all countries to provide guarantees of non-aggression. Would the world refuse him? Once war breaks out, even neutral countries will inevitably suffer as collateral damage. The experiences of the Netherlands and Switzerland during the European War are clear evidence of this. Thinking of this, how can we not be filled with sorrow? As far as the purpose of the Irish Republic is concerned, as solemnly declared in our constitution, what we seek is that all rights be recognized by others through peaceful means, that our good intentions be understood by others, so that our country will not suffer aggression. In a nutshell." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Africa's Only Independent Black Nation Requests British and French Protection</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible figures here have announced that Liberia, West Africa, the only surviving black republic in Africa, has proposed to the British and French representatives during the past week the signing of military alliance treaties with their respective countries to guarantee its independence. This would mean that in the event of an invasion by any great power, especially Germany, Britain and France would send naval and air forces to provide assistance. British figures believe that, with such an arrangement, Liberia would in effect become a joint protectorate of Britain and France. Regarding this matter, French Ambassador Corbin reportedly met with Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, this morning to discuss a proposed response. Diplomatic circles here believe that Liberia's strategic position is extremely important, and that Britain and France should accept the country's request, but only on the condition that the United States agrees. Liberia has a population of approximately 1.5 million, all descendants of African Americans from the state of Maryland. It was formerly under American protection. Therefore, Britain and France have already notified the US government of Liberia's proposal. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Officials Deny British Ambassador Carries Peace Terms; Kong Xiangxi Says Japan is in a Difficult Position, China Has Gained a Stable and Strong Position</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese officials here are strenuously denying the possibility of British mediation in the Sino-Japanese war. It is said that the British Ambassador's trip to Chongqing is purely routine. An official spokesperson stated, "We are completely unaware of rumors that the British Ambassador is carrying Japanese peace terms." At the same time, Dr. Kong Xiangxi reiterated the failure of British, German, and Italian mediation after the fall of Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Hankou. He said, "We are currently not interested in any terms from the Japanese side. Our determination to resist to the end has put the Japanese in a difficult position. The Japanese army spent four months reorganizing four divisions for the attack on Nanchang. Currently, the Japanese army is clearly exhausted and unable to continue advancing. Because the Japanese army is bogged down, they have had to request British mediation. In fact, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has informed Sir Frederick Maze of Japan's desire for peace, asking him to convey it to the Chinese authorities to gauge China's opinion. Since we were unwilling to make peace after the fall of Nanjing and Wuhan, we are even less willing to seek peace with the Japanese now. We have gained a stable and stronger 'position', both politically and militarily." Zhang Qun declared, "China's strength to resist the war has become increasingly strong. We have now begun a counter-offensive. As of yet, we have not launched a large-scale attack, but we have recovered many important points. During this counter-offensive, we have learned the true strength of the Japanese army. Therefore, we are about to launch a full-scale counter-offensive. The Japanese army deeply understands the above points, which is why they have become panicked and ultimately asked a third party to mediate. Although we do not yet know the content of the Japanese terms, they must be more lenient than before. In any case, we are fighting for independence and liberation. We vow to resist to the end."

<h3>Chinese Female Aviator Yan Yaqing Receives Warm Welcome in the US; Boniel Presents Self-Made Airplane, Dedication Ceremony Held in Washington</h3>
<p>Washington Correspondence: Chinese young female aviators Yan Yaqing and Li Xiaqing are raising funds for war refugees in their homeland by flying around the United States. They departed from New York on March 24th and flew to the American capital on the same day, receiving a grand welcome from overseas Chinese and Americans. Ms. Li continued her flight to various locations according to the planned itinerary. Ms. Yan, with the support of the famous American aviator Boniel, was to be presented with a personally supervised new model monoplane, for her journey. Because of this, she stayed a bit longer. At 2 PM on the 3rd of this month, Mr. Boniel flew the plane from his manufacturing field to Washington to hold the dedication ceremony. The Chinese Relief Committee specially dispatched Bishop Yu Bin, Counselor of the Embassy Chen Changle, Military Attaché Guo, and many overseas Chinese, as well as approximately one hundred American congressmen, to participate in the grand ceremony. A film company filmed the event. The new plane is small and exquisite, accommodating only two people, painted bright red, eye-catching, with the national flags of China and the United States painted on it. Ms. Yan's name is painted on the plane door. That evening, more than twenty members of the US Senate and House of Representatives held a banquet for Bishop Yu Bin and Ms. Yan at the Republican Building.

<h3>Certain Party Intends to Undermine Kuomintang-Communist Cooperation, Distributes Absurd and Fallacious Leaflets</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Reuters reporter here recently inquired about a leaflet found in Shanghai, falsely issued in the name of the Communist Party, stating that Britain and France are enemies of the Chinese people, urging Chinese merchants to boycott British and French businesses, and stating that if the Kuomintang does not adopt an anti-British and French stance, the Chinese Communist Party will sever relations with the Kuomintang. According to the Chinese Communist Party in Chongqing, they have not done any such thing. The spokesperson of the party stated that the leaflets were clearly issued by a certain party with the intention of undermining the united relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

<h3>Chinese Troops Increase Offensive on Kaifeng, Japanese Garrison Extremely Panicked, Chinese Morale and Popular Sentiment are High</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that, according to a foreign observer who had just arrived from Kaifeng, the capital of Henan province, yesterday (the 16th), the Japanese troops are constantly sending reinforcements to Kaifeng by train. In the coming weeks, the Chinese army's offensive strategy against the Kaifeng area will definitely be greatly strengthened. The 20th Division of the Chinese Third Army, with light military equipment, light machine guns, and light artillery units, has attacked Kaifeng, causing extreme panic among the Japanese garrison. When the Chinese army approached closer, the Japanese army closed the gates of Kaifeng. The observer expressed doubt about the Chinese army's attempt to completely recapture Kaifeng, as they believed that the Chinese army's policy was mostly to harass the Japanese army in various areas as much as possible. The observer also stated that the Chinese morale and popular sentiment are high, and everyone is talking about continuing the war until the Japanese army is defeated. Regarding the report that six senior puppets were killed in Kaifeng on Easter Sunday, the observer could not report much. Although they were in Kaifeng at the time, they had not heard direct news about this matter. They learned of it several days later from a wireless telegram issued by London. However, there were rumors that certain people who worked with the Japanese had been assassinated. When these foreigners left the Kaifeng area last week, the Longhai Railway had not been cut off. Although the Chinese army threatened to cut off this road, the observer believed that since the Japanese army had heavily defended it, it would not be easy to dismantle the rails on a large scale in that section.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Unit Attacks Huai'an in Northern Jiangsu; Men and Women of Funing Massacred and Raped</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: A guerrilla unit of the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu ambushed the Japanese near the west gate of Huai'an on the 10th. Each member produced a handgun, killing all four Japanese guards. The Japanese army inside the city was panicked, often keeping the city gates tightly closed, preventing the Chinese army from entering. As such, they returned to their defenses. When the Japanese army first arrived in Funing, they implemented a appeasement policy, hoping to lure the civilians back to the city. However, the civilians remained watching from the villages. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army went to the villages near the outer walls of the city, conducting large-scale searches. Their beastly nature erupted, looting, raping, and burning. In Yang Zhai Kou, west of Funing, sixty to seventy women were raped, and forty to fifty strong men were shot. In the six settlements east of the city, they set fires and killed, and drove hundreds of women. Once [blank] [blank], they even used machine guns to sweep behind them, forcing women and children to jump into the sea of fire. For a time, the cries were tragic.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government commended County Magistrate Wang of Pixian for leading his troops in a continuous counter-offensive, resulting in frequent fierce battles, and having recovered Picheng twice. A special telegram was sent to County Magistrate Wang yesterday to commend and reward the troops with one thousand yuan to show encouragement.</p>

<h3>General Overview of China's Film Education Conducted by the Ministry of Education in Recent Years (Part 2)</h3>
<p>In 1936, the Ministry of Education stipulated a plan to equip educational films. In the "Types of Films to be Produced," they were divided into seven types: (1) Dramatic films related to national consciousness, revolutionary history, and the New Life Movement. (2) Teaching materials and teaching methods for primary and secondary schools. (3) Common science knowledge films. (4) Special national crisis education films. (5) Hygiene films (divided into children, adults, and public). (6) Chinese new and old industries that have special characteristics and are related to daily life. (7) Rural life. "A quantity distribution was made." In 1936, it was stipulated that 60 films be produced, allocated as follows: 10 for the first type, 15 each for the second and third types, and 5 each for the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh types.</p>
<p>In 1937, the Ministry of Education's plan to equip educational films decided to produce and purchase 200 films, and formulated production goals and classification quantities: (A) "Production Goals": (1) Promote national consciousness. (2) Promote the New Life Movement. (3) Instill national defense knowledge (including physical education, military training, and scientific knowledge). (4) Promote national economic construction. (5) Impart knowledge of life. (6) Assist school education. (B) "Film Classification": (1) Teaching films (for school use), a total of 100 films: (a) Early childhood education and early childhood students, 10 films. (b) Primary schools, 10 films. (c) Secondary schools, 40 films. (d) Teaching methods, 10 films. (2) Cultural films (for general use), a total of 100 films: (a) Language and writing education, 5 films. (b) Political and civic education, 25 films. (c) Livelihood education, 25 films. (d) Health education, 25 films. (e) Family education, 5 films. (f) Art education, 10 films. (g) Teaching implementation institutions and methods, 10 films. (3) The Ministry of Education is now more actively utilizing existing educational films to mobilize the national population and strengthen the power to resist the war. In addition to producing them independently, more than a dozen types have been purchased, totaling 140 films, which can be divided into six categories: 38 types of promoting national consciousness (films related to the war of resistance are all included in this category), 16 types of increasing knowledge of life, 11 types of instilling scientific knowledge, 34 types of imparting production skills, 16 types of assisting school education, and 25 other types related to geography, scenery, and entertainment. Recently, when formulating the 1939 film education administrative plan, the Ministry of Education stipulated that in addition to continuing to shorten and print anti-war films this year, it plans to entrust well-equipped academic institutions to produce educational films related to the geography, history, customs, and recent construction of the southwest and northwest provinces, and plans to start producing lantern slides related to history, geography, civics, and biographies of modern Chinese figures from this year.</p>
<p>As for the Ministry of Education's implementation of the Six-Year Plan to train such technical personnel, it was stipulated that a training class would be opened every year from 1936, and the number of students would increase year by year. It was stipulated that there would be 92 students in 1936, 160 students in 1937, 400 students in 1938, 450 students each in 1939 and 1940, and 460 students in 1941. It is estimated that more than 2,000 students can be trained in six years, which is sufficient for the addition of educational districts in each province every year. In September 1936, the Ministry of Education opened the first training class for electro-optical education personnel in Nanjing (divided into film education and broadcasting education groups). A total of 92 students were sent by 25 provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Beijing, Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai to receive training. Currently, most of the people in charge of electro-optical education in various provinces and cities are graduates of this program. The Ministry of Education subsequently continued to run this class in Nanjing in July 1937, with a special electro-optical group and 110 students from various provinces and cities. After the Ministry of Education moved west, it continued to run the third training class in Chongqing in July 1938, with 66 students from various provinces and cities, of which 37 belonged to the electro-optical group. Although the number of institutions sending students for this session was less than before due to the war, the number of students sent by Yunnan, Guizhou, Kang, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces was particularly high. Therefore, the development of the electro-optical education industry in these provinces in the future will not be inferior to that of the southeastern provinces. (End)</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Hankou's Recent Commodity Prices After the fall of Wuhan, commodity prices in the concessions soared. Recently, they have fallen slightly. Now, we select the highest and latest prices of several daily necessities and list them below to understand the general level of life: Commodity Name Highest Price Recent Price Coal ball per load Sixteen yuan Four yuan plus Rice Per Load Twenty-six yuan Fourteen yuan and fifty cents Oil Per catty One yuan and thirty cents Ninety-six cents Salt Per catty More than one yuan Between seventy and eighty cents Matches Per box Five cents One and a half to two cents The exchange rate between Hankou and Shanghai is eleven or twelve yuan for every hundred yuan (that is, if Shanghai receives 100 yuan in legal tender, Hankou should pay 111 or 112 yuan in legal tender). North-South Goods Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Sells Actively in the North Sichuan pickled mustard tuber has recently been in short supply, and the market is quite stable. Recently, sales have been more active in the northern market, with 100 to 200 jars of Fuling mustard tuber being sold at 85 yuan, followed by 83 to 84 yuan. High-end Leqi mustard tuber sells for 90 yuan. As the weather gradually gets hotter, demand will inevitably increase, and there may be a possibility of further tightening. Yarn Flower European Situation is Critical The Yarn Market is Booming —20 Count Double Horse Breaks Through 400 Yuan Barrier— The yarn market is trending strong, and the price increase is particularly fierce. This is because the demand for 20-count Double Horse yarn is strong in South China, and purchases are very active. At the same time, there is a rumor that the situation in Europe is tense, which is greatly beneficial to yarn prices. Once something happens, foreign cotton will be difficult to arrive in Shanghai, so a buying frenzy has been set off, and the market is trending higher and higher. Therefore, since the straight drop began from the red board, 20-count Double Horse yarn jumped 8 yuan yesterday, breaking through the 400 yuan barrier. The afternoon price was 403 yuan, the highest price since February 25th. In terms of this battle line, it is deeply feared that it will rise above the red board. The underground market has reached 407 yuan. If it rises above this price, there may be a new attitude, with the possibility of reaching beyond 410 yuan. However, the 20-count yarn in the middle rises with the market, but the speed is slower. In fact, there are fewer speculators, and the public tends to favor popular goods. Double Horse yarn goes in and out suddenly, and it is regarded as a standard because its rise and fall are sensitive. Current yarn situation: The market opened vigorously in the early morning, and the situation was tight, partly because a certain firm from Guangdong was collecting in the market, and partly because the situation in Europe was pressing. Generally wealthy people came to absorb it again, so both sides advanced side by side, and the market price became more and more expensive. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was full of vigor, and it was made to 400 yuan, mostly because business was booming. When the market opened in the afternoon, buyers gathered and suddenly jumped 3 yuan, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 403 yuan. Business from the Yunnan firm was relatively strong, and colleagues pushed and raised it particularly fiercely, so the price increase was recognized again. It was found that the total purchase of each firm throughout the day was 2,720 bales. The market price of 20-count Tiannv Double Horse yarn alone rose 7 to 8 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn rose 5 to 6 yuan. Yesterday, 620 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou. The amount purchased by each firm is listed on the left: Shantou 505 Mainland 115 Colleagues 840 Wenzhou 10 (Tianjin) 85 (Hong Kong) 580 Yunnan 520 Fuzhou 20 The Japanese yarn market was relatively calm, and the price increase had been fought. This is because business in the guerrilla areas has recently decreased slightly, and shipments in the north have decreased, so the buying price is average. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month is 361 yuan, but the spot price is still holding up. Yarn Prices Soar Foreign Cotton Trading is Particularly Strong Domestic Cotton Selling Prices are Relaxed The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was affected by the speech of US President Roosevelt, so the situation in Europe turned into a moderate stage, and people's hearts also greatly improved. The cotton market was still excited by the impact, and the result was a slight increase of one or two pounds. However, the general opinion is that the selling price of new US cotton will become the world cotton price, so the general industry expects the price to fall. Yesterday, the Indian cotton market was average, with the forecast slightly increasing by 25 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market rose by more than 40 pounds, converting to legal tender, it is estimated that US cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 2 jiao, Indian cotton rose by 1 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 3 yuan. Shanghai's foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, because the Japanese army launched a counterattack and captured key areas, people's hearts turned firm, and sales of spot yarn in various places gradually loosened. As a result, yarn prices soared, exceeding the 400 yuan barrier, and cotton trading benefited a lot. Yesterday, the total import of US cotton was 400 bales, Hongzhang imported 500 bales of Indian cotton Bai Luoqu, and Laofeng imported 500 bales of Indian cotton Guo'er. On the Japanese factory side, Shanghai imported 1,000 bales, Rihua imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, and Neiwai imported 1,000 bales of Indian cotton. Here are the converted prices of foreign cotton yesterday: Raw Material Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax 60 count Egyptian cotton Premium 104.20 Again Again Medium 101.80 80 count Again Premium 128.60 Again Again Medium 118.40 20 count US Metlin 81.70 Again Again Substandard 68.55 32 count Again 90.40 Again Again Substandard 97.50 42 count Again 91.20 Again Again Substandard 80.45 South American Brazilian cotton Premium 85.00 Again Again Medium 82.70 Again Again Substandard 76.90 10 count Indian Pingguo'er 61.45 16 count Indian Aomula 64.15 20 count Indian Bai Luoqu 79.35 Ancient 12 count US Xinte 84.45 32/42 count US Pengjiapu 88.95 The business of domestic cotton has become more active, but the factory side is still sluggish and inactive. Market trading is all done by colleagues, half of which is speculative trading and half is for supporting business. Moreover, rumors are rampant in the market, saying that Europe is uneasy and that unexpected events may occur, and foreign cotton cannot be transported to the Far East. Therefore, the outlook is optimistic. Another saying is that foreign firms have increased the insurance premium by 2 yuan per load. However, today the selling price of domestic cotton is actually loosening, 5 jiao weaker than the previous day. The source of Subei is declining. Tongzhou flower reached 222 bales. Here is a record of the current cotton situation: Tongzhou flower 77.80 Colleagues enter 64 bales Telegraphic Transfer Stock Exchange Fire Machine Flower 70.50 Again 500 bales Cash Again Again 70.50 69.20 500 bales Again Again Hede Flower 87.30 Again 300 bales Telegraphic Transfer Again Xiasha Flower 76.00 Again 200 bales Again Again Pitou Sichuan-Yunnan Parcel Post is Open Cotton Cloth Business Suddenly Becomes Strong Domestic Cloth In the morning market, British firm Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth opened with an increase of 1.5 to 2.5 jiao per piece for various weights. Coarse cloth from this factory also rose in unison. Nine-pound underwear rose by 1.5 jiao. Dasheng, Xinyu, and Zhenzhong 14 and 16 pound brands also followed with an increase of about 1 jiao. Hand goods are 5 fen to 1 jiao cheaper than the new price. More than 300 bales were collected by this street and the Wenzhou firm. Fine cloth and fine twill were affected by the sharp rise in Dongpi, and also saw an increase of 1 jiao to 3 jiao. 200 bales of dyed grey cloth were sold. Speculators purchased and stored 100 bales. The Guangdong firm purchased more than 100 pieces. The Subei firm had already started to expand, purchasing nearly 50 bales of fine cloth from Peacock and Artillery brands. There is still a strong demand for bleached and dyed cloth on this street. The southwest Guangdong firm continues to purchase, adding more than 300 boxes of colored twill, colored cloth strips, plain pongee, and other goods. Yesterday, the Sichuan-Yunnan firm restored postal delivery of large parcels through the post office, and the backlog of goods is expected to be cleared, and the speculation is even stronger, with nearly 400 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, and thread flannel being sold, and the selling price rising by 1 jiao to 3 or 4 jiao. Dongbu The dyeing and sales business on this street is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the appetite of the northern customers is also strong, so the selling price of fine cloth and fine twill rose sharply again yesterday (per piece) by 2 jiao to 3 jiao. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth has risen to 13 yuan and 3.5 jiao. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine twill are out of stock. The bidding price of Yanghe fine twill must be 12 yuan and 9 jiao, while the price opened by foreign firms is 1 jiao higher than the market price. The upper grades of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill are extremely scarce. The middle and lower grades of fine cloth are all priced at 13 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 jiao. It is said that fine cloth in Hankou costs 18 to 19 yuan per piece, and is controlled by Japanese merchants for sales, so the Shanghai market is even tighter, and speculation among colleagues is also high. Yesterday, more than 35 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were ordered from various foreign firms. Dong Mianyi's family sold more than 1,000 pieces, and in terms of actual sales, 2,000 pieces were purchased on this street, more than 700 pieces were purchased by the Tianjin firm, and 300 to 400 pieces were purchased by the Qingdao and Yantai firms. Also, it was found that 118 pieces of cloth were imported yesterday, from Tianjin to Shanghai, and 40 pieces were exported, to Shantou. Thin Plain Serge Has the Smallest Price Increase Yesterday, the transaction of woolen goods was prosperous, and the price was firm. Light-colored thin flannel summer goods, etc., which are in short supply, have slightly increased in price. In short, since the 813 incident, the market changes of woolen fabrics and wool fabrics have been more frequent than in previous years, and the market price of every kind has been rising sharply. However, the price increase of Wan Chang camel gray plain thin serge has been the smallest from beginning to end. For example, the domestic Zhanghua 918 is currently sold at a wholesale price of 3 yuan and 3 jiao per yard, while before the war, it was sold at 3 yuan and 5 fen. Ordinary Western thin serge, which was sold at 3 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 jiao before the war, is now only sold at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 jiao. The reason for this is nothing more than the influence of Dong's serge, and the fact that the Yongxing Hongkang factory, which was recently established by Japanese merchants in Hongkou, produces a large number of goods. The price increase of all kinds of thin plain serge is uniformly slight, less than one-third of other woolen fabrics. Grain The International Situation is Treacherous Local Foreign Flour Factory Flour Yesterday, the spot flour price turned upward. The market opened in the morning, and the new transactions felt lively because it was the beginning of the week. Both the North-South firms and the Mainland firms inquired about it. The international situation has been tense recently, and orders for foreign flour and wheat have often been delayed in arriving at the port. Local wheat is in short supply and prices are high, and people's hearts are gradually improving. Therefore, the price of the No. 2 Flour Factory was immediately raised by 5 fen. This has been recorded in this newspaper. It is heard that the sales volume of various firms in Fujian, Shantou, Hebei, and Shandong yesterday was about 50,000 bags, and the retail sales on this street were also nearly 10,000 bags. The price of the No. 2 Flour Factory is uniformly 4 yuan and 4.5 jiao, and the price of the second-grade No. 3 and No. 4 is 4 yuan and 2.3 jiao. Flour exports: 14,000 bags were shipped to Shantou on the 17th, 41,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin on the 18th, and 2,200 bags were shipped to Yantai. Also, 3,000 bags of skins were shipped to Shantou on the 17th. On the same day, 677 bags of wheat came from Xin'gang. Foreign Flour The trend is also upward. According to foreign telegrams, prices have been reported to have risen in the United States and Australia. The reason is that the international situation is treacherous, and various foreign firms have uniformly called for higher prices. It is temporarily difficult to approach futures, and the cheap spot foreign flour that has been floated is gradually becoming scarce. The big players who hold the goods insist on not selling, so the supply in the market is scarce. Only the Beiyang firm has traded a batch of Fox and other brands, and the retail of miscellaneous brands on this street is just a decoration. It is heard that the price of medium-grade brands has risen to 4 yuan and 4 jiao for telegraphic transfers, and 4 yuan and 4 jiao, 45 fen. However, due to different miscellaneous brands and trademarks, there are also spot transactions of 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 and 3 fen. The market environment is quite firm. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice have not changed. Yesterday, various firms came to Shanghai. Heshui had a total of 4 and 5 numbers, and the Cheshu baozi from the Jiangsu-Tong firm had more than 2,000 bags, the Kunshan firm had 500 to 600 bags, and the Changzhou firm had 250 bags, for a total of more than 3,000 bags. After the market was slightly tight the day before, yesterday, the appetite of this street showed slack after the opening. Speculators have also turned dull, but the selling side's speculation is still firm, so the prices of thick and thin japonica rice have not changed. Du Yangjian and Pujian are also similar, and it is difficult to find rare stocks, but the demand is not wide, so there is no change. Oil Cake Raw Soybean Oil Rises Endlessly Yesterday, the price of raw oil exceeded the latest record of last Saturday. However, under the high price, transactions were reduced. Yesterday, only 200 cans of Tianjin Hall bottled oil were traded, at a price of 46 yuan and 9 jiao, and 10 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, at a price of 39 yuan, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Soybean oil was affected by the delivery of Dalian soybeans. Yesterday, the clients who operated Dalian goods said that 30% of the large and small baskets of Lianqi oil that had been thrown out earlier would be delivered to clear the procedures for both parties. Therefore, people's hearts immediately turned from soft to hard. The early oil Hengshan, which was loaded from Kobe at the end of April and the beginning of May, was helpless. Only the Yinghua-style old head ticket price of 33 yuan was hawked. However, people in the industry have not dared to touch the Yinghua Company's orders, because the cost of telegraphic transfers also requires about 40 yuan, which makes the market atmosphere even more tense, and the highest prices have been repeatedly set. According to statistics, more than 300 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, with prices opening at 41 yuan and 5 jiao, and rising to 44 yuan. Other Yantai-Qiqi traded 120 pieces, Lianqi large and small baskets 130 pieces, Fengnian oil 50 barrels, bleached oil 50 barrels, Dayou Factory oil 200 loads, and Suifeng Factory canned oil 800 cans. On the 17th, 1,221 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Dalian. Soybean Cake Plummets The near term falls below the 3 yuan mark, and the forward market is slightly more stable. Recently, soybean cake trading has only involved Dalian cake. The market situation has not been encouraging because it has not yet reached the peak sales season. Market prices have been hovering for many days. Yesterday, it suddenly rebounded due to the strong arrival of sources, plummeting 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li. The decline in the forward market in June was slightly slower, because it is expected that it will be in the peak sales season at that time, so the general aircraft companies are still absorbing it. However, the market price once fell to the 3 yuan mark, and the closing price rebounded by 2 fen. Yesterday, a total of 3,000 pieces of spot Lian cake were traded, with prices ranging from 2 yuan, 5 jiao, 2 fen, to 9 jiao, 5 fen. 2,000 pieces in May, priced at 2 yuan and 9 jiao, 7 fen, and more than 10,000 pieces in June, with prices ranging from 3 yuan to 3 yuan and 2 fen. On the 17th, 4,000 pieces of soybean cake were shipped from Dalian. Sugar Market Futures Crystalline White Sugar is Traded in Large Quantities Foreign Sugar is Soaring Yesterday, the futures for Taikoo crystalline white sugar in June were replied, and it was found that the telegram requested a purchase amount of 17,000 bags. Yesterday, 15,000 bags were approved for exchange, at a price of HK$10.05. The insurance cost for Dutch coarse white sugar has also increased, rising to 75%, and the situation in Europe is uneasy, and the water feet may need to be increased at any time, so people's hearts are extremely high now, and the performance is rising endlessly. The association's quotation for 24 coarse white sugar is 26 yuan for spot goods outside the warehouse, 26 yuan and 2 jiao for the native warehouse, and 26 yuan and 3 jiao for Da Jinyuan mark. The initial quotation for Dutch coarse white sugar for transshipment was 17 yuan and 9 jiao, and then rose to 9 jiao, 5 fen, to 18 yuan and 5 fen, and 400 to 500 bags were traded. Later, the quotation was 18 yuan and 2 jiao, but it was not completed. Taikoo crystalline white B mark West Warehouse is 26 yuan, and very few were sold, so it is tight. OW mark is 25 yuan and 8 jiao, 5 fen, HX mark is 25 yuan and 4 jiao, and domestic sugar Sanshengbai rose by 2 jiao and 3 jiao, opening at 24 yuan and 6 jiao, followed by 24 yuan and 3 jiao to 24 yuan. Mian Chih rose by 2 jiao, opening at 15 yuan and 2 jiao, and a total of 100 bags were traded. Dry and elegant Tiao Qing goods were idle at 13 yuan and 4 jiao, and 150 to 160 bags were traded. Silk Tea White Factory Warp Rose by 10 Yuan Yokohama Raw Silk Near Term Up, Far Term Down Yesterday, the silk market was closed in New York, and Yokohama was firm and stable. Spot goods were 1,135 yuan, the same as the previous market, and the far term was 1,058 yuan, 1 yuan less than the previous car. At the close in the afternoon, spot goods rose by 10 yuan, and the far term fell by 12 yuan. It seems that the silk price has indeed reached its peak, and since yesterday, the far-term raw silk has declined. Only spot goods and near-term goods still have the remaining momentum of the price increase. Looking at the situation in Europe, there is a sense of imminent storm. Therefore, if this port can take advantage of this peak to launch silk sales to the United States as much as possible, it should be the most opportune move. Yesterday, foreign firms continued to trade silk, and the silk price was stable and the transaction was small. 7/8 warp was sold at 1,690 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the previous weekend. Renji, Dachang, and other firms each entered nearly 50 loads, all of which were May futures. Yifei Zhuangkou was quiet again yesterday. Although there were occasional inquiries from overseas, the price limit of foreign firms was very harsh, so it was not accepted by general crude silk customers. On the 17th, there were also 106 umbrellas and 11,000 pieces of native paper shipped from Wenzhou. Coal Bituminous Coal is Firm High-grade bituminous coal: Because local customers continue to purchase, the inventory is decreasing day by day, and there are not many sources, so the market is firm and persistent. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm also arranged for Yuepu coal to be purchased from Hokkaido, totaling 1,000 tons, which was unloaded at a warehouse in Pudong, and entrusted to a certain firm to manage the sale. The ex-factory price of the same industry was 34 yuan per ton for unified coal, 36 yuan per ton for sectional coal, and 30 yuan per ton for coal chips.

<p>Taxpaying Chinese Association Held Representatives’ General Meeting Yesterday The Chinese Directors, Including Yu Qiaqing, Were Reelected and Agreed to Request the Municipal Council to Reconsider the Increased Donation The Shanghai Public Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association held its first representatives’ general meeting for the 28th year at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. The meeting elected directors and members to attend the Municipal Council and the Executive Committee of the Association, and listened to the report of the previous directors and members on their participation in government. All five Chinese directors in this session, including Yu Qiaqing, were reelected, and all seven Chinese committee members except for Xu Guanqun were also reelected. The general meeting resolved to request the Municipal Council to reconsider the increase of 2% in the municipal general donation by the Municipal Council. The details are as follows: Chairman's Address After the ceremony, Chairman Xu Jiguang gave the opening speech, saying, "Representatives, under this special situation, all municipal affairs in the Public Concession can still proceed step by step, which is gratifying. However, due to the abnormal development of the market, it seems to present a booming atmosphere on the surface, but in reality, all prosperity belongs to the consumer side, and the prosperity of the production side is still difficult to achieve. The most reassuring thing is the maintenance of public security, the emphasis on education, and the relief of refugees. The efforts of the Standing Bureau have achieved considerable results. Moreover, in times of emergency, everything is expensive, and public and private expenditures are not what they used to be. Balancing surpluses and deficits must take into account both aspects. Cutting the long to make up for the short is a way to increase revenue, but cutting feet to fit shoes is not a way to reduce expenditure. I hope that the wise authorities will pay attention to this in terms of donations and taxes. In short, this year's achievements are not easy. The taxpayers should pay tribute to the painstaking measures of the authorities. I will not go into details. I hope that the representatives will understand." Elected Directors The election of directors and members (1) The election of two Chinese directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council for the 28th to 29th years.

Recent Photo of Newly Appointed Committee Member Xu Guanqun Mr. The Public Concession Municipal Council resolved to increase the municipal general donation by 2% from October 1st of the 28th year. This Association should send a letter to the Bureau again to reconsider the resolution. Send a letter to the Municipal Council regarding the increase of the municipal general donation by 2% from October 1st, and request a reconsideration. In case there are indeed financial difficulties and it is unavoidable to implement it, it should be reduced when the market situation is better and the exchange rate is restored to alleviate the people's difficulties. (2) The Vice Chairman of the Public Concession Municipal Council, McNotten, has made outstanding achievements in maintaining security within the Concession and assisting in the relief of refugees. Now he will ask for leave to leave Shanghai. The Association should express its gratitude in the name of the representatives' general meeting. Agreed and passed. (3) The Public Concession Municipal Council has been working hard to protect the legal rights of citizens and expand Chinese education for the past year. The Association should send a letter to the Bureau to express its gratitude and request that it adhere to its original intention and implement the spirit of the rule of law to protect legal rights and interests. Agreed and passed. Resolutions in Various Cases Special Environment Private Goods Abound Customs Encourages Secret Reports To Award 40% of the Proceeds from Private Goods, and Earnestly Hope That Outsiders Will Report According to the Information The Jianghai Customs has previously stipulated the measures for rewarding informants who report and seize tax-evading private goods, "Awarding 40% of the proceeds from the private goods (up to a maximum of 40%), but it must be reviewed by the Customs to see if the reported situation is suitable before it can be accepted. Otherwise, it can be rejected. After the Customs receives the report, it should still send personnel to investigate and prove that the report is true, and the Customs staff must seize the private goods before the reward can be given according to the regulations. No excuses should be made that the Customs has received a secret report, regardless of whether the report is true or not, and whether the private goods have been seized, to索取發獎金。」 The reporter has recently learned from relevant sources that after the implementation of this regulation, it has achieved remarkable results. However, in the current special environment, tax-evading private goods are flooding the market. In order to further combat smuggling, the Customs has not only informed all the police to work hard to combat smuggling, but also hopes that outsiders will report according to the information in order to avoid tax evasion. The reward measures are still the same as before. A Japanese Boat Sunk Near Yejidun The Japanese Naval Command sent three gasoline boats yesterday morning (16th) to patrol the inland river and sailed to the vicinity of Yejidun above Beixinjing when they were suddenly attacked by guerrillas lurking along the coast. The Japanese army was caught off guard and immediately opened fire on the boat to resist. The guerrillas often used dense machine guns to sweep. A Japanese gasoline boat was sunk and more than 20 Japanese sailors drowned. Pudong Imposed Martial Law Twice From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, special martial law was imposed twice along the Pudong River, and the Dongchang Road ferry traffic was blocked twice. The urgent reason was that the Fourth Battalion Headquarters of the Naval Landing Force received a secret order from the Hongkou Headquarters, saying that three Chinese people, wearing naval uniforms and carrying weapons, had infiltrated Pudong, hoping to attack the puppet members. The Japanese Marine Corps battalion was dispatched in a panic. After the martial law was lifted in the morning, the same emergency search was conducted again in the afternoon, but no results were found. The civilians were deeply afraid of accidents after being startled several times in one night, and some temporarily took refuge in Puxi yesterday. Chongqing Telegram Wang Jingwei Has Arrived in Shanghai It is Said That Wang is Now Living in Hongkou Reuters Chongqing, 17th: It is rumored here that Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai on April 9 and is now living in Hongkou. Wang's colleagues have set up their headquarters in a house on Seymour Road. Today's National Spiritual Mobilization Citizen World Propaganda Day Tomorrow is the Propaganda Day for the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors, and the Whole City Should Enthusiastically Hang Flags. The Citizens' World Mobilization Association Issues a Declaration. Today is the Citizen World Propaganda Day of the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' World National Spiritual Mobilization Association has issued a declaration, elaborating on the importance of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and the urgency of its promotion. The Association is now enthusiastically promoting the branch organization of the Citizen World, and it is expected that at least 200 or more branches can be established during this Propaganda Week, and the number of people who formally participate in the National Covenant Oath will be around 50,000. Tomorrow is the Propaganda Day for the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors. The persons in charge of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of the three sectors held a joint meeting and resolved to not only publish a letter to the agricultural, industrial, and commercial compatriots, pointing out the work that should be done at present, but also to mobilize all sectors of the city to enthusiastically hang flags in unison. Tomorrow morning, the national flags will fly over all shops, factories, and residences in the city, which will be a concrete manifestation of the efforts of all the citizens to mobilize spiritually. The declaration of the Citizens' World is recorded as follows: Jointly Strive for Freedom Our country's resistance against Japan has lasted for nearly two years. Thanks to the leadership and measures of the supreme leader of the National Government, Jiang, the loyal sacrifice of the frontline soldiers, and the firm unity of the people of the whole country, we have been able to thwart the arrogant flames of the enemy and amaze the world. Now the War of Resistance has reached the second stage. The importance of this stage lies in changing the defensive posture to an offensive posture, changing the passive to the active, so that the war can quickly turn into a general counter-offensive decisive battle, in order to achieve the purpose of recovering lost territories and establishing a new China with freedom and equality. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to rely solely on the army, military equipment, and strategies and tactics. We must implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, so that all the people of the country are under a unified organization, have a common belief, embrace common goals, and sacrifice and struggle for national salvation and nation-building. In the past, some people thought that China was a weak country, whether in terms of weapons or tactics, it was far inferior to the enemy. Taking a weak country to fight against a strong country, even if the war of resistance is prolonged, it is difficult to have the power to win. Therefore, they first had a psychological fear of the enemy, and some people were overjoyed when they heard of the victory in the front, and felt disappointed when they heard of the loss of a famous city, and embarked on a path of negativity and depression. There are even some people who only know the immediate safety, forget the imminent danger, and let the war of resistance take its course, and do not care how to save the country. These kinds of people, because there is no center in consciousness and lose their dominance in spirit, are confused and mixed in performance, and cannot be examined. As a result, it will inevitably directly or indirectly affect the future of the War of Resistance. Now China has reached a critical moment of survival, and every citizen should be a fighter in the War of Resistance, using the strength of 450 million people to defend the country and drive out the powerful enemy, and then there will be a definite guarantee of final victory. The War of Resistance certainly depends on the superiority of economy and weapons, but economy is to be dominated by people, and weapons are also to be used by people. Only a great spirit can control everything. Simultaneous Advancement of the War of Resistance and Nation-Building Although Shanghai is under the threat of enemy encirclement, we believe that most citizens have not forgotten the country or neglected the War of Resistance. For example, the work of献金救难锄奸文化 has shown an indomitable and positive spirit, and countless young people want to rise up to save the country, but feel that there is no way to save the country in the isolated island. In addition, we see the life of drunkenness and death, the habit of苟且偷生, the attempt of selfishness and self-interest, and even the divergent and unreasonable thoughts, everywhere. Since the ranks have been disordered and the belief is not concentrated, how can we save the country and strive for final victory if we do this? Therefore, the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization is to unify and expand the organization of the people, correct all the unreasonable and even hindering habits, life, and thoughts of the past, and take the country first, the nation first, military first, and victory first as the goal of common efforts. At the same time, do not forget that China's War of Resistance is a national revolutionary War of Resistance, in other words, the premise of implementing nationalism, democracy, and even the people's livelihood. We must not only strive to resist Japan and achieve final victory, but also build a new China with equal national status, equal political status, and equal economic status. Therefore, during the war, we must advance the revolutionary and constructive nature of the Three People's Principles in both aspects, striving to resist Japan on one hand in order to achieve final victory, and building the country on the other hand in order to establish a new country with freedom and equality. Seriously Implement the Stipulated Outline The foundation of the War of Resistance and the outline of nation-building determined by the Central Government are the fundamental plan for the integration of theory and practice. If the people of the whole country follow it unanimously, the wartime life, actions, and spiritual cause can have combat and constructive properties, and can be coordinated with the national policy of the War of Resistance and nation-building. If everyone has this belief, that is, everyone has this spirit and activity, from mutual trust to mutual trust, from unity to struggle, with the great strength of 450 million people to save China and build China, then the final victory will be like a shadow, expected to arrive. This Association has now been established following the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal</p>

<p>Free Talk on Oaths Mao Lie</p>
<p>Formalism is inherently undesirable because it merely pursues external appearances and does not emphasize practicality. The result is nothing more than deceiving oneself and others, and engaging in empty displays. For example, extravagant weddings are nothing more than showing off wealth, and lavish funerals are nothing more than pleasing the mourners. Neither is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>However, this refers to personal matters. If it is a mass movement or public behavior, it must have some appropriate form to openly declare it to the world. In the propaganda methods of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association this week, there is an item for holding oaths to the National Covenant, which I believe is the kind of form that is necessary, and we should all abide by it.</p>
<p>During the oath-taking, if a large-scale gathering is not possible due to environmental conditions, there should at least be a small-scale meeting. A solemn ceremony and the presence of responsible leaders to supervise are even more essential conditions. I think that holding the ceremony separately like this will definitely achieve both positive and negative benefits.</p>
<p>Positive: Under public gathering, regardless of age or status, or strength, everyone takes the oath as a citizen, vowing to unite and engage in the war of resistance and national reconstruction. At that time, it will surely leave a deep impression on everyone who participates, and in the future, it will surely enable them to practice it physically and achieve concrete results.</p>
<p>Negative: If he is an unknown traitor, he must find ways to avoid it and refuse to come to take the oath. In this way, we can find out his true colors and leave him nowhere to hide. If he has become a traitor and still dares to participate, then once he is exposed, we can impose severe sanctions on him, so that he has no room for complaint and other traitors know what to fear.</p>
<p>The positive effect is to encourage ourselves, and the negative effect is to prevent traitors. To go a step further, preventing traitors means preventing them from hindering our great plan of resisting the war and building the country, allowing us to achieve our goals as soon as possible. Therefore, the negative is also positive.</p>
<p>I hope that when each branch, or rather, each organization, holds this kind of oath-taking, everyone who belongs to it can be present, no matter how busy he is. Even if he is sick, he will come even if supported by illness, or even carried on a bed, not acting as a traitor who deliberately evades the oath. At the time of the oath, everyone will show sincerity and determination to abide by the National Covenant, and there will be no suspicion of being a traitor either in fact or in theory!</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that after the oath, we will all supervise and urge each other, and always abide by the National Covenant!</p>
<h3>Pearl Buck's New Book "The Patriot" Chen Donglin</h3>
<p>Pearl S. Buck is the recipient of this year's Nobel Prize in Literature. She is world-renowned as a writer who is a "China expert." At a time when China's war of resistance is proceeding fiercely, the Nobel Prize has precisely chosen this writer who has always used China as her subject. International attention is, in this literary aspect, also focusing on this struggling China. At this time, Pearl Buck produced a work with the theme of China in the War of Resistance - "The Patriot". This will undoubtedly cause a sensation in various countries around the world.</p>
<p>"The Patriot" has differences in subject matter from her previous novels with China as the background: its scene extends to Japan, with extremely detailed analyses of Japanese customs and sentiments. General readers will definitely find her understanding of Japan interesting. What is of particular interest to us Chinese readers is that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will also become a character in the work and appear before the readers.</p>
<p>The protagonist of "The Patriot," Wu Yiwan, is the son of a Shanghai banker. This rebellious son hates everything about his family - he hates his father's wealth, hates the shackles of various rituals in the family, and he holds a deeply critical attitude towards his surroundings. Under this suffering, he is finally led by his poor female classmate Enlan and joins the Communist Party at school, doing the work of organizing and leading the masses, and he feels inner comfort. But as an idealist, he believes that there are only "good" and "evil" in this world, and as long as the "evil" is simply removed, an ideal world will surely appear. It was when the flames of the Northern Expedition were burning all over China that he placed great hope in the revolution, believing that as long as the revolution succeeded, the world he idealized would appear. However, the revolution was not yet completed, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party suddenly split. The ensuing purge left our Yiwan with nowhere to stay in China. Therefore, with the help of his powerful banker father, he escaped from the tiger's mouth and fled to neighboring Japan.</p>
<p>His hopes shattered, he felt despair over everything. In Japan, he lived in the home of his father's friend, Muraki. Here, he saw that Japan seemed very peaceful on the surface, but the freedom of some people was being completely deprived. Everything was brutally controlled, while maintaining so-called extreme peace and order. Later, Yiwan gradually fell in love with Kimura's daughter, "Zhuichi." In the vortex of love, the shadow of turbulent China gradually faded in his heart. The September 18th Incident, which happened suddenly and ended quickly, did not move him much. When the newspaper talked about peace, Yiwan married Zhuichi. Their marriage was very happy, and soon Yiwan became the father of two children. A sweet family life made him give up all hope, and he had melted into this other environment. But soon, the sound of cannons at the Marco Polo Bridge resounded throughout North China, awakening the people of the whole country, and finally making our protagonist rise up. The ensuing cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party gave Yiwan an opportunity to return home that he never dreamed of. He gave up everything and resolutely returned to China alone. He had already decided to sacrifice everything and dedicate himself to the cause of saving the Chinese nation. After returning to China, he was sent by Generalissimo Chiang to the northwest corner of China, where he reunited with his former Enlan - now an officer in the Eighth Route Army. He joined their ranks and launched guerrilla warfare against the Japanese army on the vast plains. In his work, Yiwan regained his original revolutionary ideals.</p>
<p>Slave's Dream Liu You</p>
<p>The golden color is tinged with the scenery of spring, red lights, green wine, and clear songs, this scene that is most endearing is the slave's dream!</p>
<p>Slaves cannot escape the whip of the oppressor. They lament their fate, let themselves be bound and trampled upon, what they gain is that sweet, mesmerizing dream!</p>
<p>The slave's dream is dyed with intoxicating colors, stirring people's sad mood. In the dream, everything seen is exceptionally beautiful, everything heard is very pleasant, everything obtained is incomparably precious, in the dream, they all seem to have ascended to immortality!</p>
<p>But this slave's dream, in order to make this gorgeous dream, forgets the sorrow of being a slave, forgets the terrible fate of the future!</p>
<p>Sweet and extravagant dreams, tied to the hearts of thousands of slaves, for the sake of this moment's pleasure, forgetting endless pain!</p>
<p>Dreams, the dreams of slaves, are like an incomparably sharp knife, pushing these poor people onto the guillotine, executing them with the death penalty of beheading.</p>
<p>The slave's dream is like strands of thin silk, cocooning people as if in a prison!</p>
<p>One day, this intoxicating slave's dream will be shattered, leaving only the cries of thousands of slaves!</p>
<p>Give up this endearing dream, it is better for the slaves to take out their perseverance and break this dream themselves!</p>
<p>China's Spring Luo Hua</p>
<p>In the cold and lonely embrace, a gentle warm breeze blows; look around lightly and quickly, open our eyes of the heart. On the quiet land, a green patch of small grass; it is the season of new life, spread our smiling faces. Under the ancient stone bridge, the gurgling river flows; there is hidden vitality, stand up our bodies. In the bright red flower industry, a row of green hills; this solemn composure, raises our chests. On the verdant branches and twigs, a cluster of tender sprouts; it is a sign of development, extend our arms. In the silent wilderness, a rumble of new thunder; listen to the roaring cries, grip our guns tightly. In the dark and gloomy night, a faint line of dawn; this light of hope, aligns our steps. In the azure sky, a white sun shines; it is the mountains and rivers of the motherland, sing our triumphant songs.</p>

<p>It's raining, how annoying! But I know the rain will stop, as long as the wind changes direction, the sun will come out.</p>
<p>I am sick, how painful! But I know the disease will heal, as long as I pay attention to hygiene, I will soon be able to regain my health and live happily.</p>
<p>The country has been bullied, how difficult! But I know the bullying will pass, as long as we resist in unity and strive to build the country, we will soon have a bright and splendid Republic of China.</p>
<p>Everything in the world, all things in the universe, have certain principles and certain tracks. Loss of principle is chaos, and deviation from the track is disaster. It cannot be said that there will absolutely be no chaos and disaster, but this is only temporary after all. Principles and tracks will eventually exist forever, never extinguished. What does temporary count for compared to eternal!</p>
<p>We see, we look far away, behind the dense clouds that cause the rain, isn't the sun still shining? In the hidden places of the groaning and twisting body, isn't there still a healthy physique supporting it? In the depths of the disintegrating country, isn't there still a magnificent and vast national soul inspiring it? Our hope is not in vain, and the time to realize it is not far away!</p>
<p>Let us work hard, neither be disappointed nor anxious. All misfortunes will be like nightmares, and will soon disappear without a trace when the light of dawn arrives!</p>
<p>On Leadership Worship Bai Ying</p>
<p>It seems that someone once said that every young person should have a central figure of worship in their mind. We usually hear that someone is a thoughtful person. In fact, all people have thought activities, so pointing out that someone is a thoughtful person actually means that this person's thought is organized, not the scattered thought that is common to ordinary people.</p>
<p>For a person's thought to develop to be organized and systematized, it must go through various evolutions in thought - gradual filling of experience and knowledge. But there must be an indispensable element here: the worship of a figure. However, it is not the idol-like worship of a figure, but the rational, scientific worship of a figure.</p>
<p>If a person's thought tends towards organization, no matter how curvilinear the process of his thought development is, it must have a certain degree of stereotype. What determines this stereotype is someone who leads his thought to develop in a certain direction. Although this someone does not exist in our thought at the beginning, when the thought develops to a certain degree, such a figure will appear in our minds, progressing with the progress of thought. Our belief in this someone gradually deepens, and eventually we develop a worshipful psychology towards him. Only when the evolution of thought reaches such a stage does our belief have a certain destination; and only the worship of a figure that is gained in the process of thought can be called scientific worship of a figure.</p>
<p>Some people are very opposed to the concept of hero worship. This kind of person's point of view emphasizes the saying that the times create heroes, and ignores the role of individuals in history. A person's becoming a great man and a worship object of some masses is certainly determined by the person's various environments, but the main thing is that the person's character can synthesize the essence of his era's environment and embody it in his way of life and thought. That is why a great man and a hero become the center of public admiration. What distinguishes a leader from ordinary people is that he can actively grasp the environment and use it. Although he still has to do this due to the impetus of the masses, the determining point of this impetus still has to be concentrated in his person. The leader and the power of the masses are an organic structure and cannot be separated from each other.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that the hero worship of the general masses is an idol-like worship, and they have not gone through the cognitive process of thought. But we believe that the general masses directly recognize their leaders from real life. They recognize from real life who is really seeking their welfare and who is really guiding their lives. Therefore, although the form of their hero worship is close to being idol-like, it is actually based on real life. Sometimes a false leader can also be blindly supported by the masses for a time - as in the case of fascist countries - but soon they can recognize the true face of the leader in real life and overthrow him.</p>
<p>Recently, after reading Dong Xianguang's "Chiang Kai-shek" and a biography of Lenin, I couldn't help but think of the fanatical emotions of the masses before and after the Xi'an Incident, and at the same time imagine the Soviet people who constantly came to pay their respects at Lenin's tomb. The fact that the Soviet Union has today's strength and China has been able to complete today's great unification and work together to resist the war cannot be underestimated the significance of hero worship - leader worship.</p>
<p>In order to enrich our own thought and to stereotype our own personality, we should all have a central figure of admiration in our minds. This can not only enrich our righteous belief, but also give us a lot of spiritual comfort at all times.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Aspirations Wen Zongshan</p>
<p>This is not a vague and ethereal fantasy; I am often touched by subtle things to evoke all kinds of aspirations and create countless thoughts.</p>
<p>"Heroism" is enough to make the general public worship, and I am no exception. I want to see many soldiers setting off in unison, encouraging that untouched heart. The clear streets are crowded with people, waiting to see what attractive things will come. Sure enough, tall horses, sharp bayonets, and orderly steps, a column of multinational merchant regiments march past in review. "The China Team" is here, a burst of applause and cheers. I love to see such valiant figures, to exhale the turbid breath of the past two years. But when I think of other situations, the applause and cheers have to be expressed in my heart!</p>
<p>My aspirations arise from the cheers of the masses. The asphalt road is changed to a rugged highway, and tall buildings become towering mountains. The bayonets are still brightly shining, and the steps are still serious and uniform, but these young people setting off in unison are all fighting for freedom and justice. So, I am not afraid of my throat being hoarse and shout wildly! I don't care if my palms are red from clapping. In the end, I might pick up a shotgun for hunting birds and follow along.</p>
<p>However, in the place where I am standing now, there was once a hideous "victory parade." This other aspiration made me rekindle the fire of anger that was accumulated in my heart.</p>
<p>A Wonderful Use of a School Building by a Certain School Jin Ge</p>
<p>At about six o'clock in the morning, the tea boy A Ling, with a broken bell with a missing corner in his hand, went to each classroom to ring the bell. His mouth scolded like reciting a book, "You bunch of lazybones! What time is it, and you still don't want to get up?" Those single men were awakened by the ringing, hurriedly climbed out of their quilts, quickly rolled the bedding into a bundle, and shouldered the bedding to the sun deck to put it down.</p>
<p>A Ling shook the bell from room to room, and those single guests were driven out one by one. If there was a man who wanted to pretend not to be awake so that he could lazily sleep in the quilt for a while, hum! A Ling was not easy to provoke! He pulled your quilt open, and shook the broken bell hard next to your ear, and his mouth was full of "Ma ya, niang de" curses. If you wanted to say "no," hum! Report to Principal Wang, do you still want to sleep here tonight?</p>
<p>A Ling saw that all the classrooms were cleared, so he put down the bell, changed to a broom, swept each house, and casually rearranged the tables and chairs piled in the corner. Just now it was a communal floor bed room, but now it is a sacred and solemn classroom.</p>
<p>From six thirty to eight thirty, two classrooms were rented to a commercial cram school to open a special accounting course. At this time, that group of prospective accountants also came one after another. They came with sleepy eyes, and some were still yawning.</p>
<p>Before eight thirty, those elementary school students were not allowed to enter the school, and were only allowed to play in the alley outside the school. Because Principal Li of the commercial cram school had an agreement with Principal Wang in advance, "We are not a small school, we need to be quieter." As for the children in the alley, Principal Wang didn't care at all if they dug gutters or touched mud.</p>
<p>At half past eight, A Ling opened the school gate. On one side were those prospective accountants rushing out anxiously. Many of them were real staff members of the shop, and they had to rush to work at this moment; on the other side were many grinning children squeezing in. With the squeezing on both sides, many children were knocked to the ground and began to cry loudly.</p>
<p>The classrooms were extremely dark. This was decided by Principal Wang: without his order, no one was allowed to turn on the lights privately. Once, Mr. Chen, who taught arithmetic in the fourth grade, saw that the children in the back seats really couldn't see the words on the blackboard, so Mr. Chen ordered A Ling to turn on the lights. Later, when Principal Wang found out about it, he called Mr. Chen in and scolded him, saying that he didn't know how to save materials in extraordinary times, deducted two yuan from his salary, and warned him that if he turned on the lights privately again next time, he would be fired!</p>
<p>Gymnastics was in the courtyard, singing was in the kitchen, the hall was divided into two, the front half was for reading English in the room; the pavilion room was the residence of Principal Wang and Mrs. Wang... there is no need to write about all of this in detail.</p>
<p>As soon as school was dismissed at four o'clock in the afternoon, the children were not allowed to stay in the school for a moment. They had to leave the school with their schoolbags within ten minutes, because from four thirty to six thirty, Principal Wang had already lent the classroom to the typing class of the commercial cram school that I mentioned earlier. They are not a small school, they need to be quieter.</p>
<p>There is an English cram night school in the evening, which was founded by Principal Wang himself. It is divided into first, second, third, and fourth grades. Mr. Wang also concurrently serves as the teacher of the fourth grade.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, before the English class was over, those single lodging guests had already shouldered their bedding and waited at the door.</p>
<p>Mulan Joins the Army Chen He made</p>
<p>Khan asks what you desire,</p>
<p>Mulan does not need the title of Senior Secretary,</p>
<p>Willing to borrow the thousand-mile feet of a bright camel,</p>
<p>To send my son back to his hometown. (The End)</p>
<p>Life Report We are Car Drivers Xu Yinghui</p>
<p>The two words "driver," when readers see them, will definitely bring a thought to their minds - that is a humble profession! No, absolutely not. This profession is sacred labor, it is noble and holy. Thousands and thousands of cars are driven by us - the drivers - day in and day out, making them serve our humanity faithfully and exerting their unique effect. Therefore, our profession is to increase the welfare of the entire society, the entire country, and even the entire world.</p>
<p>The cars we drive are divided into two types: one is a truck, that is, what is generally called a truck. The other is a passenger car.</p>
<p>Since our government has been making efforts to engage in highway construction, trucks have become important in transportation. Driving this kind of car is more difficult. Every morning, we drive clumsy and inferior trucks to our destination. The rich are having sweet dreams, while we have to get up early and work hard because of the pressure of life. The coolies on the car are responsible for carrying the goods to the car, and we just watch them work. All around are working comrades; there is no luxury or hypocrisy here, everything is pure and honest. After working for five or six hours, it is time for lunch. We feel hungry in our stomachs, so we go into a commoner's restaurant and eat a random meal to fill our stomachs, without paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene. In the evening, we drag our wooden legs home. Our faces are covered with dust from the road, and our clothes are full of mud. When we went out in the morning, we were a neat person, but when we come back, we are covered in mud and dust, and full of foul odors. After working like this for thirty days, the wages we get are only more than thirty yuan. After deducting the cost of food, there is less than thirty yuan left. A family of young and old lives on this. In this Shanghai where the cost of living is rising, frugality is naturally to be expected.</p>
<p>Driving passenger cars is completely different from the situation of driving trucks. The owners are young masters or big merchants and wealthy businessmen - generally members of the bourgeoisie. They can do nothing all day long, look for pleasure all day long, have no sorrow and no worries. When night comes to the earth, it is their time to be active. They walk into places of extravagant singing and dancing, everything is joyful and gorgeous, making people linger. We stay outside, guarding the empty car, lonely waiting for the owner. Intoxicating jazz music leaks out from inside. There is no pure honesty of labor here, it is completely a world of paper drunkenness and gold fascination. On this quiet and boring night, only drowsiness is used to pass the precious time. Late at night, the owner comes out with a joyful heart, and we reluctantly open our sleepy eyes and drive the car back. Driving passenger cars, yes, life is much more comfortable. Although the wages are only about twenty-five or thirty yuan, there are still extra gifts. At meal times, we don't have to go to the restaurant, and there is more delicious food to fill our stomachs. Indeed, life is more comfortable than driving a truck, but being immersed in extravagance and luxury all day long, this life is too decadent!</p>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, many fellow friends have gone to the rear to serve the country, driving military vehicles. They often boast proudly in their letters of their greatness and glory. How ashamed we are! We are still stranded on this solitary island full of twilight, and the flames of shame often burn in our hearts.</p>
<p>After the Rain, a Clear Sky Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Illusion or Reality, Acting on the Stage; To Proceed or to Stop, Making Home Everywhere</p>
<p>At that time, it was not easy to find out the whereabouts of Chen Jun because Chen Jun served in a certain military agency, and this military agency was constantly changing. Moreover, in military affairs, many things are secret, and it is also not easy to find a person of important relationship. Xiangzi took this little child and searched everywhere from south to north, from the eastern district to the western district, but could not get his whereabouts. After searching for about half a day, Chen Jun had not been met, but he met Mr. Li, who had studied abroad in Japan with Chen Jun. Mr. Li saw that Xiangzi's face was haggard and no longer like it was in the past, and he also sighed deeply. When asked about her life, Xiangzi told him everything: her brother had died in battle, her old father had died in prison, and she was left alone with only this child, who was Chen Jun's flesh and blood. She was looking for her husband thousands of miles away, just to give this child a father. As for herself, since she was the daughter of the enemy, she did not expect to recover what was lost. After hearing this, Mr. Li was very concerned about Xiangzi, and he naturally knew Chen Jun's whereabouts because at that time this military agency was stationed in that place in Xiang Province. Mr. Li was in another military agency, and now he had some important military affairs to go to Hunan. Mr. Li said to Xiangzi: You can come with me to Hunan, and I can explain everything to Chen Jun. Although you are Japanese, you can be considered to have nothing to miss in Japan. After the war stops, you can still be husband and wife. And I know for sure that since you returned to China, Chen Jun has not remarried. It can be seen that he has not forgotten you in his heart, and this matter is enough to make you feel at ease. A few days later, Xiangzi followed Mr. Li to Hunan. Her intention: first, to return the child to Chen Jun; second, to persuade Chen Jun to remarry and not to hinder his future because of me. But when she arrived in Hunan, Chen Jun had gone away on a business trip, saying that he would be back in three or four days. Who knew that on the way back, Chen Jun was not far from where he was stationed, but he was bombed by enemy planes and seriously injured in the car. He was sent to the hospital, but it was already incurable. By the time Xiangzi brought the child and rushed to the hospital, Chen Jun had already closed his eyes and sacrificed for the country. Xiangzi thought that she had finally found Chen Jun after thousands of mountains and rivers, thinking that she could meet him once, but who knew that she was still empty-handed. After Xiangzi had Chen Jun taken care of, she entrusted the child to Chen Jun's good friend Mr. Li, and jumped into the Xiang River to die. This is the story in the play "Tear Stains of the Xiang River." According to the playwright, this is not entirely a castle in the air, there really was such a thing, and Chen Jun in the play was an old friend of the playwright. (Eight Nine)</p>

<p>The Wonderful Uses of Radio in the Performing Arts World Lu Degang</p>
<p>In addition to providing entertainment, radio has many other wonderful uses:</p>
<p>In England, people care for animals very much. In order to enable cows, horses, cats, dogs, chickens, ducks, etc. to enjoy happiness, a radio station specially hired experts to broadcast to these birds and animals. What is broadcast is all kinds of sounds. When these sounds are transmitted into the ears of animals, it will make them wag their tails and show happy and joyful appearances, which is very effective. According to multiple experiments and research results, it has been proven that cattle have the highest degree of hearing and can even understand and appreciate jazz music.</p>
<p>Norwegian fishermen have recently invented the use of radio to help with whaling. The previous method of whaling was that when fishermen discovered a whale, they immediately shot a harpoon into the whale's body, but after the whale was injured, it would often slip away without knowing where it went. Therefore, some people have now invented a harpoon with a clever radio, and no matter where the whale escapes after being harpooned, it cannot escape the ears and eyes of the fishermen, because the radio on the whale's body continuously broadcasts the whale's sound waves, and the fishermen only need to follow the sound to find it, without exception.</p>
<p>Radio has another wonderful use, which is that it can attract many marine fish. After people who fish install a radio on a fishing boat, there will often be many sharks and sponges (note: sponges are animals) following the boat to eavesdrop. Fishermen only need to make a little effort to catch a large number of fish.</p>
<p>Old Star Xiao Ying Returns to the Screen Jin Qiu Bao</p>
<p>He wishes for the dark earth</p>
<p>To soon repeat the bright blue sky</p>
<p>So that people who love movies</p>
<p>Can breathe the air of freedom and liberation</p>
<p>Xiao Ying, an old star who has been in the Chinese film circle for more than ten years, has been out of the film circle since leaving the Star Company and changed his profession. He opened a Jianye Department Store on Fulu Li Road in the French Concession. Time flies, and four years have passed in the blink of an eye. Movie fans have gradually forgotten Ah Xiao, who is handsome and lively, and is accustomed to playing soldiers, fathers, and villainous young men on the screen.</p>
<p>The reasons why Ah Xiao left the film industry that year once aroused speculation among many friends and movie fans at the time, but according to what this reporter knows, it was entirely due to family reasons. He has a total of nine people in his family in Shanghai (two wives, who are sisters and married him, six children, and himself). He also has a first wife and a young and beautiful daughter in his hometown of Changsha, Hunan. He used to be a basic actor in the Star Company, and his salary was one hundred and eighty yuan. Because of the monthly salary arrears, he was in a dilemma, and the family burden was so heavy. Therefore, in the autumn of the 24th year of the Republic of China, he resigned to the Star Company and looked for his own way to make a living to maintain his family's life.</p>
<p>Ah Xiao is fifty years old this year, and he is still as lively and innocent as a child, and is very pleasing. His view of life is "happiness and struggle," and his private life is so serious, he doesn't smoke, doesn't drink alcohol, doesn't gamble, doesn't go to dance halls, and doesn't have any hobbies.</p>
<p>Recently, I met him on Fulu Li Road, which is full of exotic flavors. He invited me to his Jianye Department Store to talk for more than an hour. He talked about the vicissitudes of the Chinese film industry and the different lives of everyone in the Chinese film circle in this great era. He said, "I have recently returned to my old profession. This time, I have accepted the invitation of Yihua Company to participate in the new film "Chronicle of Film City." I have long been unfamiliar with acting skills, and the results cannot be perfect. I want to ask everyone to forgive me. I am old and outdated! I hope movie fans forget Xiao Ying. However, I have been very excited recently. Although I am no longer good, I have recently seen that our Chinese film industry is progressing day by day, and new people are also increasing day by day. Whether it is from the director, music, scenery, sound recording, photography, acting, etc., all aspects have progressed greatly compared to the past. Thinking of my debut work more than ten years ago, I can't help but laugh. Chinese movies more than ten years ago were so childish! Obviously, our Chinese film industry is advancing with the giant wheel of this era, just like our country, society, and life."</p>
<p>Ah Xiao said when I was about to leave, "He is wishing for that year, that day, when the current dark earth will return to the bright blue sky, so that our film industry can also breathe the air of freedom and liberation, and be able to put all the pain, darkness, and displaced lives that people are suffering in this era on the screen for our descendants to see. This glorious, tragic, and good movie will definitely be welcomed and praised by people."</p>
<p>After Watching the Three-Act Tragedy "First and Last" Tie Liu</p>
<p>This is the second time I have watched a performance of "Shanghai Drama Art Society's" One Week Theater. To be honest, these two public performances have given us a very good impression. When we look at the efforts of all the personnel and the success of the performance, we cannot but see the efforts of the Shanghai Drama Art Society in standing on the position of drama and the undeniable merits.</p>
<p>As for the audience, perhaps they have further demands on the Shanghai Drama Art Society, that is, they hope that the Drama Art Society can take a step further and stage some more advanced works. Although this may be a kind of excessive demand, we believe that being able to look forward will always be beneficial to a fact, although we do not want "blind action" or "impulse."</p>
<p>When I finished watching the play, I immediately felt that although it contained anger, it did not contain resistance. Although there was a struggle between sin and conscience, it did not negate and fight against "brother's world."</p>
<p>To be honest, I feel that this play is too pessimistic. Should the ruled class just groan, howl, and die at the hands of brutality and torture!</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of objective effects, we must negate this kind of escape, acceptance of pain, and weak and incompetent attitude.</p>
<p>In the performance part, we must admit the success of Mr. Wu Renzhi, the director of this play, in handling the techniques.</p>
<p>Because in this three-act tragedy, there are only three characters in the whole play, and the director is able to express its emotions and atmosphere among the few characters. This is indeed not easy. In particular, the director used film techniques in many parts, which is very dramatic. Even silence and contemplation express a special mood.</p>
<p>For example, in the first act, the lighting is very good. It uses the red reflection from under the fireplace to shoot on the actor's face, making it produce a gloomy and terrifying feeling; however, for this act, I think that in addition to the two light areas of the writing desk and the fireplace, the light in the remaining parts is a bit too dim. At least, we should not make the actor's face black, and here, we see Zhang Jie walking to the edge of the stage once and approaching the fireplace to pour wine once, and his face is completely in darkness. Because there are only two people in this act, although the director uses the movement of position, it still cannot reduce its heavy feeling.</p>
<p>Second Act: The air is more tense than in the first act, and the actor's position is also lively, but I think that after the lights are turned on, they seem to be too strong.</p>
<p>Third Act: The effects are very good. Before the man and woman commit suicide, the relative silence is very excellent. After the lights go out, because the lights were not adjusted well, Zhang Jie lost the effect of the lights when he burned the letter under the strong lights. This must be corrected.</p>
<p>Actors: I feel that they are all good; Xu Li's crying should be reduced slowly in the first act; Zhang Jie is very calm: his style and posture can express the arrogance of this character; Zhang Wanjun transforms pain, she is a good actor.</p>
<p>When Xu Li writes the letter, the music with intense tones represents the confusion in his heart, which is well matched.</p>

<p>Zhang Dagong's Funeral Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Dagong, a giant in the drama world who was good at playing comic roles and was the father of Zhang Huicong, a female impersonator currently affiliated with the Carlton Grand Theater, suffered a major shock after leaving the Empress two years ago, resulting in mental disorder, which became an incurable disease. He lingered until yesterday at the hour of Yin, and died. Huicong was filial to her parents. Her throat disease had just recovered, and she was devastated by this accident. She wanted to die. The coffin was placed in the Jiangning Public Office for temporary storage at yesterday's Weishi. Huicong's mother and daughter supported the coffin and cried sadly. Those who heard it were saddened. Many comrades from the acting world and the drama world went to hold the ropes, including Wang Xichun and her daughter, Jin Suwen, Liu Wenkui, Wang Lanfang, Zhu Xiaolou, Xu Hanmei, Song Chiseng, Gu Jianqiu, Qiu Yusheng, Wan Meiyan and many others. Huicong has the nickname of Little Poor Thing. Yesterday, Yuan was so sad that he almost collapsed, and he felt even more pitiful.</p>

Although it is said that he was harmed by the master, and he had the suffering that a dumb person eats Coptis chinensis and cannot tell, how could he have received this evil reward if he hadn't been muddled in his work? So he was named Gu Du, mainly to blame him for being muddled.</p>

<h3>Securities Have No Other Outlet, Domestic Bonds Become a Focus; Prices May Gradually Approach Those of January 10th.</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market was very strong yesterday, with a very good trend. The buying interest was rare since the informal market began. Rumors are rampant that the domestic and international situation has turned in a favorable direction. The concentration of a large number of U.S. warships in the Pacific is clearly a show of force. The situation in Europe should be kept in check. International loans are coming in a steady stream, showing that the debtors are reliable. The Sino-Japanese war is becoming increasingly smooth. There are rumors in the market that banks are buying, and some well-known big players are also buying in large quantities. The good market atmosphere has its reasons. It is faintly heard that various bonds can be pledged to banks at very favorable discounts. The many rumors are to be confirmed by facts. However, one point is the biggest driver of the upward trend. Since this year, various speculative businesses have been unprofitable. Cotton yarn prices have risen too high. Foreign exchange is controlled by the authorities and there is no fluctuation. There is no profit to be made from arbitrage. Bid gold and foreign currencies are also too expensive and very risky. All other things that can be speculated are at their peak and cannot be handled. Therefore, there is now too much excess. This can be seen from the recent fatigue of discount rates. They have all shifted from the gold market to the securities market, and their prices are still in the middle. The arrival of the British ambassador in Yunnan has made the air of peace even stronger. Big long positions continue to add positions. Retail short positions, although falling one after another, are ultimately unable to resist due to the disparity in strength. After this round of purchases, the chips on the table are becoming increasingly scarce. Class A has reached 62 yuan, and the market estimates that there is a hope of 65 yuan. Nine Six has also exceeded the 7 yuan mark. It is heard that the Northern Gang is buying, so there are still many good prospects. The high prices of January 10 are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>Yesterday's process: After Xinfeng Yong took the lead in buying, Defu Dafeng Tiansheng Yongkang and No. 4 successively absorbed. The sellers were all small numbers. Numbers 20, 38, and 41 all sold. Runli Lianhe and Yongkang also had some floating cuts. However, the supply and demand still felt very different. In the morning, it rose another four or five corners. In the afternoon, there were many who switched from short to long. Numbers 4 and 5 were particularly in demand. Tongshun Lianhe and Mao Tai all bought. Runli and No. 41 sold a little. Class A rose to 62 yuan, not far from the previous high price. The Nine Six public bond also broke through 7 yuan. The price is high, but the goods are scarce, which is a sign of continued upward movement. Market prices continued to rise by four to eight corners. The total number of transactions was at least 2.5 million yuan. Here is a simple table:</p>
<p>Category Maximum Minimum Closing Change from Previous Day January 10 Market Price Amount Higher than Yesterday's Closing</p>
<p>Unified Class A 62.00 61.00 61.90 Up 0.80 63.60 Higher 1.70</p>
<p>Unified Class B 54.70 53.60 54.50 Also 0.70 56.80 Higher 2.30</p>
<p>Unified Class C 53.50 52.25 53.00 Also 0.45 55.25 Higher 2.25</p>
<p>Unified Class D 53.10 52.30 52.90 Also 0.50 54.35 Higher 2.35</p>
<p>Unified Class E 53.05 52.10 52.75 Also 0.40 54.35 Higher 1.60</p>
<p>Nine Six 7.10 6.85 7.05 Also 0.25 7.40 Higher 0.35</p>
<p>In stock trading, 650 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 7 corners, one corner better than before. Also, the China National Goods Company held a shareholders' meeting yesterday, with a net profit of more than 68,000 yuan. This time, the interest rate will be 8%, and the dividend will be 2%, so each share will receive 2 yuan. The official interest from last year will also be paid at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the Zhongye Public Guild's report, the foreign stock market was better after U.S. President Roosevelt announced his call for peace. However, people are still not enthusiastic, because they have learned from the past few times that their wishes have not been fulfilled. Jardine Matheson shares traded actively, due to rising yarn prices, and the transaction price rose to 20 yuan and 1 corner. Public transportation traded at 27 yuan. Ruirong ordinary shares traded at 6 yuan and 7 corners and 5 cents. Yeguang shares were weak and traded at 8 yuan and 5 corners. Telephone 6% bonds traded in large quantities at 95 yuan.</p>
<p>U.S. statistics show that consumer rubber consumption in March was more than 50,000 tons, exceeding the hopes of rubber bulls. Inventories decreased by 12,000 tons. Under these circumstances, rubber raw materials and stocks should have a good impact and rise in normal times. People also expected the poor performance of local rubber companies in 1938 and will ignore future business. However, the Dutch rubber export tax in 1938 was one penny per pound, but this year it has been reduced to about 0.25 pennies.</p>
<h3>Finance: Tianjin Gang is Still Buying, Cash Prices Still Lack Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) over-the-counter market remained sluggish and unchanged, with prices hovering between 2,075 yuan and 78 yuan all day. All parties are focusing on the content of the replies from the US and German presidents. Although the securities gang (代理 Tianjin gang) and cash accounts are buying, a certain gold shop and money exchange business are still selling a lot, so there is no impact. As a result, there is no honor or disgrace compared to last weekend. Not many transactions were made in one day, with only more than 400 taels in the morning and no trades in the afternoon. The silver shop's jewelry gold has not changed, and the customs gold and China-UK pure gold have not risen or fallen either.</p>
<p>烚赤" Not Traded in the Afternoon</p>
<p>In the morning, each bar of ten taels was first bid by the securities gang at 2,075 yuan, but the sellers were willing to supply only at 80 yuan. The two sides held on to each other until 9:50 before a deal was made. For the first time, the securities gang entered the silver shop gang with 50 taels, and the opening price was 2,078 yuan, one yuan higher than the last weekend. After the opening, although the selling intention of a certain gold shop was strong, the absorption power of the cash account and the silver shop gang was still good, so the situation was quite stable. The gold shop sold a total of 100 taels to the silver shop gang and 50 taels to the cash account, and the prices were the same as the morning opening. Then, a money exchange business absorbed 50 taels from a certain silver shop, and the price was also 78 yuan. The cash account then entered the silver shop gang with 50 taels, and the price was still 78 yuan. After this, a certain money exchange business suddenly sold, and at that time the buying intention was weak, so the situation was slightly weak. A certain money exchange business sold a total of 100 taels to the industry, and the prices were all 75 yuan. Later, the securities gang came back to absorb, and the potential situation stabilized. The securities gang entered the silver shop gang with 50 taels, and the price was 77 yuan. It was already past 11 o'clock, and after that the supply and demand were scarce, and the price was also fixed. It was delayed until noon and no opening was seen, so the noon closing was still 77 yuan. In the afternoon, the supply and demand were even scarcer, and the market was sluggish. Although a certain money exchange business shouted 77 yuan to sell, the buyer offered 76 yuan to absorb, and the two sides held on to each other until the late closing and no single order was heard. It is said that the business of the money exchange industry is also quite quiet. According to the noon closing price of 2,077 yuan, the result is that there is no honor or disgrace compared to the closing price on Saturday night. The selling price of the cash account's own brand gold is 2,085 yuan, and the receiving price is 2,075 yuan. The current bid gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no opening.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Stands Still</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry gold, per tael, has not changed because the "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) situation is very stable. Datong Bank is 211 yuan, Xin Tonghang is 209 yuan, and the receiving price is 203 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Pure Gold Also Unchanged</p>
<p>The central bank's purchase price for Chinese cash is still 1,220 yuan and 3 corners, and the listed customs gold is also 2 yuan, 3 corners, and 9.6%. The Shanghai standard gold price has not changed either, at 1,207 yuan and 6 corners, which is due to the fact that the price of British pure gold per ounce in London on the 15th has not changed, still at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement Has Not Decreased, Result is Flat</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no decrease in settlements by foreign firms. In addition, the Tianjin gang continued to buy. However, foreign banks such as HSBC supplied quite a bit, and Chinese banks once sold off US dollars, causing the US dollar to slightly weaken in the middle. However, it soon returned to flat. As a result, there was no honor or disgrace. Trading was still strong in the morning, but very quiet in the afternoon. The Hong Kong dollar was quite stable due to the balance of supply and demand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London large bar, near and far, was still flat. The New York silver price was still fixed. The London gold price had not risen or fallen. The exchange rates were flat for British pounds against US dollars, against Shanghai dollars, and against French francs. The US dollar suddenly rose to 4,375 (possibly a typo), not moving against Shanghai dollars, and rising 3,125 against French francs. The central listing of each exchange rate was as before. The bank's morning opening selling price was 8 cents and 25 for British pounds and 16 yuan and 0625 for US dollars, with no honor or disgrace compared to the noon closing on the weekend. After the opening, although foreign firms were buying, British Bank HSBC still supplied a good intention, so there was a lack of change. Foreign firm settlement at HSBC British pound 8 cents and 25, HSBC listing was announced without movement, and the silver balance tax announcement was also without ups and downs, still taxed at 5%. After this, the Chinese banks suddenly sold off US dollars, so the situation was slightly relaxed. The Chinese bank sold to Youli (代理 Tianjin gang) US dollars 16 yuan and 09375. Afterwards, foreign firm settlements gradually increased, so the potential situation turned flat. Foreign firms settled into Holland and a certain Hua Bi Bank US dollars 16 yuan and 0621. Near noon, the transaction turned clear, with only slight Hong Kong dollar trading, but the situation was also flat. Foreign firms absorbed Hong Kong dollars 56 yuan at Anda Bank, and by noon, the bank's selling price was no different from the morning opening.</p>
<p>The closing situation was quite quiet, and the price was also stable. It was only heard that foreign firms slightly settled foreign firms British pounds 8 cents and 25, but no transactions were heard for US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. By the late closing, the bank's selling price was British pounds 8 cents and 25, US dollars 16 yuan and 0625, and Hong Kong dollars 56 yuan. As a result, the British, US, and Hong Kong dollar exchanges had no ups and downs compared to the noon closing on the weekend.</p>
<h3>Australian Gold Notes Drop by 3.5 Corners Alone</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. Yesterday, local foreign exchange, foreign firms' needs were very strong, and foreign banks supplied smoothly. The US dollar position was also relatively ample, and it once loosened. Later, bank absorption was quite strong, and it gradually stabilized. As a result, British-American exchange rates had no honor or disgrace. The "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) opening was firm, but the buyers saw that the market price was already high, and the buying intention was weak. The sellers were afraid of the power of the guest gang, and it was difficult to recover their losses. The two sides insisted on not lowering, and the transaction suddenly felt scarce. There was no opening in the afternoon, and the market situation was stable and sluggish. However, the money exchange industry's "烚赤" (slang for gold bar) transactions were quite active, and it was more colorful than the exchange. Foreign currency British-American gold pounds, the rich mostly sold, and the supply and demand of British-American gold notes was still strong and tended to be stable. Only Australian gold notes were supplied and fell more sharply. The association's transactions did not open. Yesterday's market price, British gold notes rose 1 point, French franc notes rose 7.5 cents, and Australian gold notes fell 3.5 corners. All other gangs did not change.</p>
<h3>Tianjin "Counterfeit Money" Plummets by 3 Yuan and 2 Corners Below 90% of Legal Tender</h3>

<h3>Counterfeit Dingtu: To Know That the Virtue of Zhou Has Not Declined, How Can Jing Ask About the Ding?</h3>
<p>"Stamp duty," Since the war, the post office has stopped selling it and there has been a temporary shortage. Later, market merchants jointly set up a method to transport it and distribute it to various industry guilds for sale, so that the business community can purchase it. In this extraordinary time, the government's income cannot be reduced, and the few points of "stamp duty" are also the obligations that the people should fulfill. Recently, it was heard that the "pseudo-Finance Bureau" also issued "pseudo-stamps" to collect people's wealth, forcing merchants in the occupied areas to purchase and affix them. Otherwise, for violating the "pseudo-rules," they would be fined heavily and their business would be stopped. The merchants in the occupied area, under special circumstances, endured humiliation and reluctantly found two, a brown one corner and a yellow one cent, with the title "Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui Stamp Tax Tickets" and the words "Republic of China Jiangsu Shangmai Area" stamped on them. The pattern has a "ding" (a kind of ancient Chinese cauldron) next to the pagoda, which is meant to indicate that it is a "counterfeit ding." To know that the virtue of Zhou has not declined, how can Jing ask about the Ding! (This newspaper)</p>
