<h3>日美關係張弛的前途</h3>
<p>美國對於日本在遠東方面侵略政策的反應，近來愈見顯明而具體：在七月下旬，宣佈自明年一月二十六日起，實行廢棄現行美日商約：又逐漸加强太平洋的海空軍力，以表示其在國際間所致力之方嚮；今又盛傳待明年商約滿期後。擬即實施對日禁運軍火；美國態度如此演進，可信美日關係在今後幾個月內，勢必重新有所決定。日本政府爲調整兩國國交起見，曾任命和美國政府官吏有相當友誼的野村外長企圖利用他個人的關係，在外交上闢一新的途徑，這種末策，至現在爲止，顯然並未發生效力。上月美國駐日大使格魯，在美日協會席上，曾以坦白直率的言辭，說明美國維護在華權益的決心，並吾認日本的所謂「遠東新秩序」。日本的政界和輿論界，也都以美國對遠東的認識不足，兩國國交頗有不易改進的表示；但是日外長終於在上週末，邀請格魯大使作試探性質的談話。格魯大使不但毫未變更態度，且以其演說作爲書面節略，當面交付。日昨日本外部又派特使加藤來滬活動，據聞擬就地與美總領事等有所談判。日本政府這樣的不憚麻煩，到處設法，也就足以顯見她對美日關係深刻焦慮的一般了。</p>
<p>美日的關係，實際上並不怎樣複雜，美國所要求的，祗是保全九國公約的存在，繼續維持門戶開放政策，使她的在華權益，不受損害。日本倘能放棄獨占遠東的野心，不作創造「遠東新秩序」的幻想，則美日關係極易得到和好的調整。可是日本不此之圖：她以爲歐洲戰事的發生，將使英法減少其在遠東的力量，而估量美國並沒有什麼堅强的意識，固定的政策；因此日本不但不知尊重美國所持有的權益，從事調整兩國的國交，反欲美國去遷就她的野心。她要求美國以放棄在華權益，和撕毀九國公約，來換取日本所謂「遠東新秩序」的眞正認識；甚至於還希望美國從經濟方面，帮助她完成所謂新秩序的建設工作。</p>
<p>目下日本對美外交關係的調整工作，仍舊是採過去那套老辦法。除却宣傳親甲親乙以壓迫美國外，祗是運用一些小技巧，以期取得絕對有利的地位。例如她常以極虛偽而拙劣的辭令。再次聲明，絕對尊重美國在華權益，並願對於損失的適當要求，予以賠償；但是實際上，她決不放棄其排斥第三國在華勢力的政策。她以「旣成事實」爲法理的根據，如用武力在中國造成日本的權益，拿來作爲美國在華權益的對抗；她前此在中國東北所造成的權益，已經阻止了第三國經濟勢力的發展；她現在又想以各淪陷區域的各種經濟建設，來作爲排除歐美在華權益的新工具了。此外，她又想用哄騙無知婦孺的魔術，要求美國把中日戰爭發生以來所有美日間的懸案，不向日本交涉，而向日本所手造的傀儡交涉。日前東報主張美國對於中國海關，平榆鐵路所定材料貨價，和長江通航等問題，都　候所謂「新中央政府」成立後接洽辦理。這不僅是把日本對美國所應負的責任。完全諉卸，並且意在引誘美國無形中承認僞組織在國際上的地位。這是多麼無聊的打算呀！</p>
<p>美國的外交政策向來是很明期的；日本玩這些小技巧，其實何能遮掩美國人士的耳目！就是所謂戰爭的威脅，也未必能使美國孤立派畏懼日本，其他更不必說。很多的日本人，以爲美國的外交政策，注重實利；美國對日的貿易，在日的投資，都較對華來得巨大。其實誰不知日本兼併中國，纔是美日貿易衰落的初步；日本獨吞中國，日本纔有威脅美國的可能。即以最近將來而論：中國抗戰後的建設復興，必然是美國最大的主顧。日前美外交協會曾發表專文，主張對日施行經濟壓力，參院外交委員會主席畢德曼，亦宣稱將於明年一月，在國會中建議隨時禁止軍火原料售於日本。足見日美緊張的關係，決非日本的小技巧所得使之弛緩。繫鈴解鈴，惟有日本自已反省；而現時美國方面顯明而具體的反應，能吾促成日本的反省，這是遠東之謎！</p>

<h3>伏洛希羅夫　發表演說　蘇聯外交成功　紅軍西進經過</h3>
<p>莫斯科　伏洛希羅夫本日於紅軍大閱時發表演說、首述一年來蘇聯各方面之成就、獵稱、「過去一年爲國際局勢特別緊張非常事件時有發生之一年、吾政府推行之目光遠大的外交政策、在列寗斯達林的黨指導下、已使蘇聯超然於戰禍之外、而歐亞兩洲各大國家、則捲入其中、蘇聯與德國締結之互不侵犯條的已使吾國無與德開戰之危險、而使利用他人火中取栗之徒失望、吾國力保中立推行唯一正確的和平政策、然吾政府不能支配一切、吾國係在資本主義國家包圍之下、因而必須隨時警覺準備、在目前尤應如此、蘇聯政府當經常注視國際局勢之發展、而謀及時適當應付、」伏氏繼檢討紅軍於九月十七日奉政府命令、開入舊波蘭境內、保護西烏克蘭及西白俄羅斯人民生命財產之經過稱、「烏克蘭及白俄前綫軍隊於執行政府命令之際、表現了無窮的毅力。全動力。運動能力及英勇牲犧精神、全體戰士司令·政委及政訓人員均忠實於列寗斯達林之大業及其祖國、均摯愛偉大的斯達林、從而使紅軍堅强無比、永遠保持光榮、永遠無敵於世界、各軍開始行動前數日、曾經補充大批後備士兵及官長、其擴充時間雖極忽促、然各後備士兵及司令仍能於作戰時表現良好行動彼等奮勇作戰之精神與技能均與現役兵不相上下、値茲國慶佳節之期、余深信全國人民對吾完成任務、爲紅旗增光之烏克蘭及白俄前綫官兵政則人員、必一致由衷感謝、永矢勿忘其豐功偉業、紅軍現已恢復和平生活、但仍將努力從事軍事與政治訓練、與前此無異、每一戰士、每一司令及政訓人員均知惟有精習現代各種技術、能於複雜條件下用以作戰、惟有提高政治敎育、方能於平時爲吾紅車及吾國家保證人民的和平自由勞動、於戰時博取勝利、此不辯之事實、不但在遙遠之蒙古哈勒欣前綫、亦經測騐證實、吾軍在該方面同樣表視了爲國家及爲列寗斯達林大業矢忠盡義之模範、彼等高喊斯達林之英名、衝入敵陣、終於擊潰敵人、蘇聯政府與愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞及立陶宛分別簽定之互助公的已使吾國及各簽的國之軍略地位均有增强、按照公約駐於各該國之吾軍、僅爲諸國及吾國國門之哨兵、然吾軍將抱不干涉各該國之主權及內政、眼前之國際局勢複雜險惡已極、西方現亦爆發帝國主義戰爭而與遠東之同類戰爭相呼應、世界已被帝國主義者於兩端放火、歐亞各最大國家已自行投入戰爭漩渦、以圖解决日趨末路的資本主義之不能解决的問題、吾蘇聯人民則因政府與黨中委會外交政策正確、得免受戰爭之橫禍、此爲吾人之幸福、但吾人必須切記吾國必須更加强盛、吾紅陸海軍必須更加强大無敵、則吾政府之正確的外交政策方能更得成功、因此、吾全體勞動大衆必須更加努力增多及改進工作、使吾國更臻富庶、更臻文明、亦更臻於强盛無敵、吾人不參加戰爭、然吾人必須隨時警覺、注視世事之發展、吾紅陸海軍將隨時準備作戰、任何事物决不能攻吾國於無備、（七日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>第三國際秘書　發表言論文　揭破英法伎倆　促成德蘇修好</h3>
<p>莫斯科　第三國際秘書長第米特洛夫、在最近出版之「國際雜誌」發表一文、指現行戰爭爲帝國主義的戰爭、幷責英法兩國挑動德蘇兩國、以冀掀起戰事、其言有曰、英法蘇三國曾在戰事爆發之前、進行談話、但英法兩國同時却竭力離間德蘇兩國、直至最後一小時、尙未放棄此項企圖、此種情形業由英政府所發表之白皮書、即述及該國駐德大使漢德森前與德元首希特勒談話經過情形者予以證實、但德國終於認識蘇聯之威力而拒絕對蘇用兵、當其時也、德國原有兩途可循、或則甘爲彼帝國主義者之工具而進犯蘇聯、以自蹈危機、或則毅然決然、與蘇聯修好以樹立和平關係、德國當局熟權利害之後、終於採取第二途徑有足多者、至以現行第二次帝國主義的戰爭而論、（其意乃目上次歐戰爲第一次帝國主義的戰爭）已可分爲兩個階段、在第一階段中、乃由義德日三國為侵略者、其他如資本主義國家如英法美三國則力事退讓、藉以避免决戰、同時則希圖勸導各侵略國移轉視錢、改向社會主義國家（指蘇聯）擴展勢力、迨至第二階段、英法兩帝國主義者亦向德國採取攻勢、並用盡一切方法、欲使其他多數國家步其後塵、因此歐洲各國中凡直接以侵略爲事者、與夫鼓勵他國從事侵略者、實已毫無區別、其中自以法國帝國主義者、對於延長戰事期間與擴大戰事範圍兩層、抱有最大之决心、至其他大多數資本主義國家、此除雖未直接參加戰爭、但咸以推行虛僞的中立政策爲事、就中尤以美國最爲顯著、例如該國志在助長遠東大火、俾得削弱中日兩國、然後以默書式的條件提付交戰國雙方、從而加强其在中國所保有之地位、如是而已、總而言之、現行戰爭絕非所謂反法西斯主義的戰爭、全世界工人務當聯合一致、共同爲共產黨之目標奮鬥云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英美政界評論　莫洛托夫演說　蘇聯親德程度不深</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間政界宣稱、蘇聯外長莫洛托夫之演說與第三國際所發之宜言、並未陳說任何新方針、故不應予以過分之重視、第一耍點爲莫洛托夫在其演詞中切實聲明蘇聯在目前戰爭中之中立、而殊無蘇聯更積極的加入德方之希望、第二耍點爲宣言中加諸德國之抨擊、第三國際向國外（德國當然除外）、發表言論、從未正確反映蘇聯政府所抱之親德新態度、但繼續對於法西斯主義作一般的抨擊第三國際與蘇聯政府同在史丹林統制之下、爲人共知、今乃有此現象可見蘇聯政府所謂與德國團結者、其程度固不甚深也、納粹主義當然將設法、解釋第三國際之宣言、但終將因此而感煩惱、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、昨日發表演說、涉及美國一段有云、美國資產階級極願歐洲戰事曠日持久、果爾、則軍火商人即可獲有巨大利潤云云、此間政界人士聞悉之餘、咸以譏諷口吻鄙視態度、加以評論、並謂蘇聯當局公然表示希望全世界發生戰爭、俾克完成世界革命、由來已久、茲乃攻擊美國、未免可異云、此外蘇聯駐美大使館今日慶祝俄國革命二十二週紀念、招待來賓、美國多數人士避未參加可爲注意、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蓋達斥責　蘇聯政策</h3>
<p>羅馬　墨索里尼喉舌蓋達、今日著文猛烈反駁第三國際於布爾希維克革命第二十二週年紀念日前夕、在莫斯科所發之文吿、斥責蘇聯侵略波蘭、其言曰、蘇聯侵略波蘭、致使戰區擴大、而戰區之卒獲限制者、以義國不作任何交戰行動也、擔任保衛巴爾幹半島和平之責者乃義國而非蘇聯、全歐皆承認之、今日如有帝國主義勢力與貴族政治利益問之爭鬥、則蘇聯亦與聞焉、蘇聯刻圖利用政治壓力如資本主義所施行者以擴張並開拓經濟與天然的利益、蘇聯何嘗經營和平、反之、蘇聯在過去二十年中、無時不以戰爭爲急務、而期望以此戰爭造成共黨革命云、蓋達對於第三國際文吿譏刺義國今待有利時機加入戰勝者之列、而攫取一份戰利品等語、加以答覆謂、此種傾向、目前唯蘇聯在波蘭之行爲中見之、義國政策乃以完全公開與忠誠態度致力於挽救歐洲和平、今將竭力限制戰爭、拯救文明第三國際不配評判義國、（八日路透電）</p>

<h3>金融　利空消息湮滅　金市回頭狂跳　塲外最高達三千七百元關外　半天成交約一千五百兩之譜</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、已入佳境、蓋外匯繼續回緊甚烈、而利空消息已完全湮滅、多頭欣慰之餘、加碼者亦有、散戶扒進頗不乏人、雖津帮等乘高吐出、但市價仍抬起小少、結果較上日已狂漲一百八十元之巨、實爲近兩月來僅見之漲勢、各方人心已一致向上、其致漲之原因、（一）報載海關將禁止中國法幣進出口、業已通知各國領署、僞方不無企圖、（二）日使加藤來滬與美領商討中國時局、及英日或有妥協可能、（三）歐洲　事復有和平之空氣等、致晨開外匯報緊、金號首拉、即橫跳一百十元、爲三千六百元、嗣又高起十元、惟某錢兌業突起賣風、其時外滙亦稍形回硬、即退達三千五百五十五元低盤、但未幾匯市忽又轉緊、證券帮及某銀號（代外商）趁低撈進、且金號等多頭羣起加碼、一時做高達三千六百五十元、不久外滙復鬆、及天津帮塞出若干、致壓低至三千五百九十元、然延至結果、匯市終吿緊俏、買風愈盛、重昇至三千六百七十元高價收盤、下午逢秋季跑馬停市半天、而塲外續趨高昂、聞一度再衝出三千七百元關外、達三千七百零五元、最後價爲三千七百元光景、半天交易尙旺、約一千五百兩之譜、銀樓飾金步漲二十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲一百八十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外匯緊勢頗銳、某金號首來猛抬、開市即橫跳一百十元、銀樓帮進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百元、繼又高起十元、銀樓帮互做三十兩、爲三千六百十元、時聞外匯稍形回硬、且某錢兌業力塞二百餘兩、雖某銀號頻代外商吸進、但其時金號等亦有供意、致遂回落五十五元、錢兌業售予金號三十兩、爲三千五百五十五元、嗣因外滙忽又猛緊、某銀號買意愈濃、加之某金號及某錢兌業競相收買、立漲九十五元、某金號進同業五十兩、爲三千六百五十元、後銀樓帮等吐出百餘兩、一度回小至三千六百三十元、但不久證券帮復來購買、故又抬起二十元、證券帮進銀樓帮二十兩、爲三千六百五十元、旅以外匯冉度回硬、某掮客代津帮乘機猛售時獲利散戶多頭亦有脫手、故遂回落六十元、現金號吐予證券帮二十兩、爲三千五百九十元、將近午刻、外滙重復報緊、銀樓帮亦來吸進、即漲起二十餘元、後因某錢兌業及某金號等重起買風、致再猛升數十元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百七十元作午收價、下午因値秋季跑馬停市、結果照午收回漲一百八十元、半天一百十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元之譜、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金頻漲二十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百五十五元、迨至九時三十五分掛大十元、十時二十分續高五元、下午二時十分再漲五元、結果共大二十元、計大同行改懸三百七十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣漲風銳利　英美金鎊上升五元半　美金票亦漲一元一角</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因海關當局將禁止法幣進出、空氣緊張、殷富驚惶不安、加之外滙縮、烚赤漲、英美金鎊、需要甚殷、市價上升甚銳、英美金票吸納旺盛、美金票上午漲至十一元八角五分、雖週三下午外匯無市、美金票需要甚盛、續趨堅昂、晚收爲十二元二角五分、香港票·法郞票·需要俱殷、新加坡·荷蘭·安南票等、皆上升劇烈、坎拿大票。斐律濱票·隨美金票而銳升、日金票需要亦殷、晚市爲一元三角、朝鮮票供給見稀、晚市爲一元一角零五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升五元五角、英金票升三元八角、美金票升一元一角、香港票升一角九分、法郞票升三分、新加坡票升四角、荷蘭票升五角、安南票升三角、羅比票升一角、坎拿大票升六角、斐律濱票升二角五分、其他各幣則未更動、</p>
<h3>外滙劇緊貼現驟高八元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、因外匯劇緊、現金在漲、法幣需途復廣、致每千元之貼率驟高、而即升至三十六元、俄竟步高至四十二元、午刻稍回、爲三十八元、下午復升至最後爲四十二元、比前日高起八元、錢業公會拆息早午兩市仍開一角五分、</p>
<h3>滙市突見猛緊　華商大舉補空　英金近五辨士</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市情况、突吿猛縮、幾入五辦士大關、自週一以至本日、祗三天期間、而上落竟達一辦士之巨、據詢原因（一）傳海關對法幣進出輸運、突於某種勢力下施行嚴格限制、（二）盛傳歐洲戰局已露一錢和平曙光、（三）聞一再傾售之香港帮突傾向吸收、致又將非常扒風激起、初開尙平、繼以華商忍痛大舉補空、且港電沙遜等猛扒緊勢銳利、一度曾退達英金五辦士零六二五、美匯八元二五、良以匯豐於掛牌價五辦士已有供意、而扒風遂亦稍戢、加之斯時外行華比某行等乘貴價求售、故即回硬至五辦士二一八七五及八元五六二五、及至午刻、終因港電等復來納進、兼同時日行亦有扒結、故再縮至五辦士零九三七五及八元三一二五收市、結果英緊三七五、美軟六二五、期貨趨勢與現貨同途、半天交易現期均旺、</p>
<p>沙遜港方亦進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期漲三七五、遠期升半辦士、紐約銀價及美對外各匯兌等因値選舉日、均停市一天、倫教生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬法等匯俱平、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士四六八七五、美匯八元九三七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後有利首來扒結、不久港電與沙遜等亦起買風、加以華商紗花帮等見勢不佳、亦競相補空、且因外行供意不濃、致市勢猛進、計扒進外行現貨英金由五辦士四三七五至二五、並現貨美匯由八元八七五至三一二五、同時華商再補進大通某行有利等本月份英金、亦由五辨士四零六二五緊至二八一二五、兼本月份美滙由八元七五至半元、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大二分二五、此後某行稍來吐售、且出口商亦有塞出、故情况一度回硬至五辦士三一二五及八元六二五、嗣因賣者漸少、扒風又盛、故趨勢重吿緊軟、計沙遜港電又扒進滙鹽等外行現貨英金五辦士二五至零六二五、及現貨美滙八元半至二五、同時聞華商仍在補空、旋以聞匯豐照掛牌價有供胃之說、故一時扒風稍息、加之某行及華比乘貴吐售、致趨勢再度回硬至五辦士二一八七五及八元五六二五、午刻終因買風復熾、且同時日行跟踪扒進、故爲狀重轉軟化、迨至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士零九三七五、美匯八元三一二五、本月份英金五辦士零七八一二五、美匯八元二八一二五、結果比上日、現期英均猛緊三七五、美俱暴縮六二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>港滬滙兌猛升</p>

<h3>英印堅穩</h3>
<p>七日倫敦電、銀市投機家買進、兼印度搜購遠期、少供給、市面平、收盤後、極形平靜、大條銀、近期漲三七五、遠期升半辦士、紐約銀價、因値選舉日停市、又孟買銀電、印銀市况穩靜、現貨與十二月各長五安那、一月份亦大六安那、成交單祇十張、</p>
<h3>證券　內債萎頓　外債興奮　外股仍堅</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、市况昨日愈見萎頓、情勢愈見虛弱、人心不振、一反以前興高彩烈之狀、蓋現在之做空者、即以前之多頭、解鈴繫鈴雖出一手、而其觀念則已絕對相反、一般浮而不實者、爲數尙夥、隨時在覓機出籠、故趨勢始終掙扎不起、丙種竟又打破七元關、環境如此、人心如彼、暫時仍未能振作者、咋日上午，生大天生同康等陸續賣出、中間經二十號及大通元康等一度買進、稍見抬高、但實貨不斷流出、頽勢依然難挽、午後一般向來看好者亦把握不住、銀行求售、丙種七元關、突吿打破、形勢愈劣、鴻大聯和等亦均脫手、協大天生恒孚稍有補空、但杯水車薪無濟於事、目下情形浮多顯已在空頭包圍中、市價結果續小七角半至一元二角半、成交總數共計約一百萬元有奇、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交交通銀行股三十股、價爲五十元零二角半、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、因外滙趨緊、及某方有宣告海關禁止法幣進出口說、銀根恐有轉緊之虞、故開盤甚形虛軟、但出籠之股在低價下被吸收甚速、收盤市况略有進步、成交最旺之股、爲國際信託公司·瑞鎔·鋼業·中國墾殖·與德律風等、橡皮股因倫敦現貨價漲、趨勢較堅、</p>
<p>倫敦七日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、續見盤升、麥加利銀行股漲二先令六便士、爲八鎊十五先令、滙豐銀行英倫註册股漲二鎊、爲八十五鎊半、又香港註册股漲半鎊、爲八十五鎊、開平煤礦股續漲六便士、爲十九先令、古拉客林傍橡皮股漲一先令九便士、爲二十先令正、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>紗花　買氣轉旺　紗市回蘇　同行成交千餘包　雙馬廠開五千包</h3>
<p>凋疲已久之紗市、今得外匯改縮之牽動、市態微露轉見復蘇之象、同時比高峯時下落殊鉅、一般同業吃虧甚大、暫時或可透氣、但實際消化、尙未發展、惟同行心意見興奮、買風頗熾、成交久已沉悶、忽見熱鬧矣、但廠方乘機巨量開出、二十支雙馬五千包、價爲六百五十元、十一·十二月期、每包付定洋六十元、大都販運商接受者居多數、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人心大致望好、呌價提高　二十支雙馬開價爲六百二六元、少切聞匯票改縮、人氣陡濃、客銷雖乏問詢、然投機者紛起、市盤則步步上升、到六百四十元、旋聞廠方大批開出、回挫二元、查半日成交一千二百二十五包、行情漲十四元、天女漲十二元半、雙地球漲十元、廠方由申新廠開出十支紅雙馬一百包、價爲四百九十元、九廠開出二十支雙馬情形如上、今日有出口紗二百十七件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、〇五五　香港　一二〇</p>
<p>汕頭　二〇　厦門　二〇</p>
<p>寗波　一〇　統計　一、二二三</p>
<h3>通花跟漲二元</h3>
<p>本棉交易尙堪維持、通州花售價漲二元有奇、因紗價回起、加之外匯猛縮、以致人心振作、市態轉佳、但近來廠家在海外購訂美棉、額量殊巨、約有幾萬包、於此心意較爲安靜、不過印棉塊角兩日中上升劇烈、有一部份神經過敏者議論看好、前途究屬如何、着重在匯票方面、蘇北來源、到通花一千〇十八包、常陰沙五百八十包、北沙來九百八十包、茲將現棉情形錄后、</p>
<p>通州花　一三二·〇〇　同業　二〇〇包</p>
<p>又　一三一·五〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>又　一三三·五〇　又　四〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨因匯兌之忽形轉緊、各方交易又感靜寂、廠方日前辦進爲數業已不小、同業對於原棉之購買、繼續濃厚異常、然以匯兌緊縮特速、竟無機可乘、故祗得袖手旁觀之、大衆預料美棉交易、續有向榮之可能也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市昨爲美國之選舉日、一切交易停止、惟本埠某大棉行接得總行來電、以昨日美政府對於今後棉花貸款問題、業已發表云、因之今日美棉轉漲起二十餘磅音、印度亦因美棉貸款之謠傳、速同預測猛漲十二羅比半、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦漲二十四便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　食米湧到　行市平定</h3>
<p>米價漲風已殺、緣各區來貨擁擠、車輪續到、蘇嘉太崑靑泗楓練等貨二十四五車、及白茆口輪運轉抵常帮貨一千三四百包、且市上又盛傳京蕪等尖不日將有大批抵埠之說、以致人心頓餒、客戶不敢再購、結果卒呈平定之局、計收盤江北高尖爲二十三元二角、中市貨二十二元九角、京蕪特尖二十三元二角、次二十二元、新粳到貨亦旺、店方觀望、銷塲呆木、惟收盤行情、因與尖市接近、不肯再貶、是以未見榮辱、獨蘆羊尖貨稀，續好一二角、菉窰種小去四五角不一、百哥乏貨無市、南港早稻開二十六元、變元一則貨稀、二則酒作坊及飯担銷塲尙可、形勢頗堅、統計全市成交祇三四千包而已、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈昨晨開市後、客作鄕舖需胃不衰、行囤堅持、市價隨在各方暗拾明扳之下、一路上升、又比前日漲起半元以上、但價漲之後、一部進戶已嫌昂觀望、而獲利囤戶與日商均有售出、且江北米合申成本祇在二十一元以內、今以連日飛漲、已可通運、又傳行家與江北帮各有一批辦妥付裝、均可在日內抵埠、市塲聞此消息、賣氣立旺、市乃頓時回瀉半元左右、正式成交者祇三千包左右、</p>
<h3>油市　連豆油受壟斷　售價又升一元</h3>
<p>豆油市况自神戶大連桶裝油壟斷以來、昨大連油又扳升一元、成交一百三十桶、行市開至六十九元五角、惟簍油上漲之勢稍戢、結果比上日市略升四五角、做開膠州油二百件、價爲四十八元六角、烟歧油一百件、五十元八角、靑歧油一百件價、四十九元七角、二星期內交靑島桶裝油三十桶、本廠油一百擔、價爲五十三元八角、花生油趨勢仍平、續由港方採運、計辦去膠州油一百件、原盤、江北聽油五百聽、烟台聽油二千聽、</p>
<p>九日運香港豆油一千八百聽、麻油二百聽、豆子一百五十包</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖重振</h3>
<p>昨洋糖據荷蘭電訊、粗白爲荷盾七·一、升〇·二〇、而荷匯見縮合價須漲二元七角之多、故久疲之局、頓見回振、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白漲起三元、外棧五十二元半至二元三角、太古車白亦升二元半至二元三角、B嘜爲五十六元至五十五元七角、其餘CW嘜等照退、本綿白及一號冰以原料旣升、因亦隨升、國糖市勢甚軟、僅廣帮開出油包東鄕赤一百零六包、糖色尙佳、惟身份甚軟、僅以三十二元成盤、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日美絲價步漲　本市售盤參差</h3>
<p>昨橫濱現貨漲二十元、遠期漲十九元、紐約近期漲五分、遠期漲五分、現貨日絲漲二分至三分、華絲不動、本埠絲市因缺少進出、故未見漲跌、七八份白廠有售開三千八百五十元至三千九百元者、售盤不甚劃一、蓋根據廠商或囤客持價力量堅疲而定也、昨白廠經達昌做開二十祖、千金絲粗搖經三星等行進三十担、價無榮辱、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布生產過剩　存底有增厚之勢</h3>
<p>布市以銷塲不旺、同業及囤戶傾向賣出、雖廠方以現下市盤已跌進成本內、寗以减工停工爲對策、然减低後之生產量、仍超過實銷、故存底有繼續增厚之勢、昨外匯轉緊、紗市突吿回漲、而各布以實銷呆滯、欲漲無力、售盤大致穩定、實銷平席、浙東甬台甌都添辦怡和輕重磅粗布·色布·色斜·細斜一百餘件、閩興化泉州帮添辦色斜·錢呢·粗布·細布·近一百件、粵帮辦富貴·大鵬·細布輕重磅粗布七八十件、本街成交怡和振中等廠粗布各廠細布·細斜·漂染印花各布二百餘件、</p>
<p>東疋昨以紗市回升、白貨細布·細斜售盤稍形堅挺、每疋提漲一二角、十二磅龍頭細布現貨價十八元三角、東棉行開出本月份期貨爲十八元四角半、伊籘行開出下月份期亦祗十八元六角、各行訂出約二百數十件、本街同業心思略穩、成交各牌細布·細斜四五百件、但客帮進意仍淡、津帮辦細布數十件而已、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭竹枝行號盤俱昂</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝因甌帮採辦、突見轉升、昨市號貨已有開出數百箱、比前漲起五元、而行方因尙須加以揀剔、成本遞增、故售盤須漲十元云、</p>

<h3>阻撓法幣運滬　偽方陰謀難得逞　稅務司始終未下令禁止　美輪裝滬千萬元已卸下</h3>
<p>「維新政府」所委之「江海關監督訓李建南、竟向各國在滬領事及江海關羅稅務司、要求禁止中國法幣進口、旨在推行其「華興券」、前日美輪批亞士號裝來之法幣一千萬元、昨日已安全卸下、各國領事及江海關表示不接受、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>企圖禁止　法幣進口</p>
<p>上海之江海關自所在地淪陷後、稅收被截留、繳於正金銀行、自被迫易幟、並自九月一日起、收受「華興券」、中央銀行收稅人員被迫撤退、今竟作更進一步、由「監督」李建南通知江海關羅稅務司、及各國在　領事、企圖禁止中國法幣進口、聞各國在滬領事、對於此事決置之不理、而江海關羅稅務司、亦表示不予接受、</p>
<p>法幣千萬　昨已卸下</p>
<p>美國總統輪船公司之批亞士總統輪、於前日抵滬、由港裝滬中國法幣一千萬元、聞係中中交農四行所有、「江海關監督」李建南、竟企圖予以扣留、記者昨向銀行界探悉、該一千萬元法幣、昨已照常卸下、並未遭受任何方面之扣留、但此後法幣之運滬、是吾有問題、則難預料、又上星期二會有法幣五千萬元進口、亦未發生阻撓、</p>
<p>稅務司未　下令禁止</p>
<p>關於禁止法幣進口事、稅務司羅福德始終並未下令禁止、所以對法幣之進口、決依照原定之辦法、准予進口、外傳前日批亞士總統號輪裝來之一千萬元幣、爲江海關扣留之說、該關某稅務司昨已予以否、同時中中交農四行上海分行、昨亦已否認江海關扣留法幣、</p>
<p>上海法幣　甚為充足</p>
<p>財政部對於淪陷區域之法幣，雖已竭力防止流入、以免日人收買套購外匯、惟對於上海租界區域、爲調整各業正當需要、仍由中中交農四行儘量運滬接濟、今「江海關監督」李建南雖有阻止運滬之企圖、但「上海之法幣、甚爲充足、足敷流通租界區域、同時輔幣券及分幣券、已流通租界區域者、亦爲數頗鉅、故此後決不致感受缺乏、</p>
<p>偽方迷夢　終難實現</p>
<p>記者又訪本埠金融界某巨子、據談、僞方縱圖阻碍法幣輸入、一面大量套買、使本埠市面流通之法定籌碼减少、俾「華興」僞幣得乘機侵入市面、無如本埠流通之法幣、爲數殊巨、而前二週內、又運到新印法幣五千萬元、合之市面已流通者、爲數驚人、僞方欲圖吸收盡凈、絕不可能、如其曠日持久、則局勢瞬息萬變、僞方此種計劃、終將粉碎、徒見心勞日拙而已、况上海爲國際都市、第三國家在滬所擁商業利益至鉅、決難容此毫無準備之偽幣、作爲通貨、如僞方執迷不悟、則第三國家之反感、將與日俱深矣、</p>
<p>外滙市塲　將無變動</p>
<p>大陸報云、南京「維新政府」宣佈禁止法幣入滬後、上海金融界與商界昨（七日）夜大惑不解、截至昨日深夜爲止、外匯市塲因此新限制而將取何種趨勢、尙無徵象、據若干中國人士聲稱、紙幣入口、旣受限制、則本埠銀錢市塲、終將緊縮、而對於法幣起更大之要求、彼等不信</p>
<p>外滙市塲</p>
<p>目前將有任何大變動、但嗣後紙幣、益感缺乏時、卽將有所變動、惟此時並無紙幣缺乏之較大危險、估計已往兩週內、已有價値幾達五千萬元之新法幣、自香港運入上海、此數加前已運抵上海之紙幣、則其總數頗巨、中外銀行與金融界、均認「維新政府」此舉、乃</p>
<p>日偽方面</p>
<p>圖在上海區强用華興幣之行動、其計劃中含有由日方藉正常外匯途徑、購買法幣、終至法幣退出市塲、庶能强用華興紙幣、但預料此種手續、爲期甚長、且能發生任何事件、而使情况爲之改變、金融界並力稱、苟非發生此刻完全未可逆料之事、謂則今無理由可震驚云、查「維新政府」於</p>
<p>宣布禁止</p>
<p>法幣入口前、其所派海關關員曾圖扣留披亞士總統號昨自香港運來之法幣約一千萬元而未果、聞此等法幣、係本市某外商銀行之香港支行運來者、因此事關係複雜、故「維新政府」所派之江海關監督」李建甫允許此等法幣入滬、然後通知領袖領事、謂此係最後一批准許入滬之法幣、</p>
<p>領袖領事</p>
<p>接獲通知、乃轉吿本市各總領署又上海泰晤士報云江海關當局昨日首次實行李建南簽發之「梅關新通吿」、而扣留自香港載披亞士總統號輪運交本市大通銀行之法幣數百萬元、經銀行方面、與其他當局抗議以及長久之磋商後此等法幣乃經海關入口而交</p>
<p>大通銀行</p>
<p>但聞「海關當局」曾稱、此後當嚴守禁止法幣進出口之命令、昨日海關扣留法幣一舉、頗令人驚詫、因「維新政府」雖在本市海關派有監督一人、而迄未禁止法幣進出口也、但李建南昨晨已通知本市各國領署、「維新政府」已頒命令、對於未備特別執照之法幣、禁止進出口、此項通吿、雖於</p>
<p>昨晨發出</p>
<p>但其日期、則書十一月四日、海關方面或因此點故昨有扣留運交大通銀行之紙幣一舉、海關通吿全文、雖未公布、但聞該通吿規定凡秘密運輸法幣者、將遭拘禁、遇特別情况、則將經正當途徑而發給許可證</p>
<h3>葡輪釋放內幕　冒名「登記」輪公司未接洽　向葡領署查詢後始悉眞相</h3>
<p>關於葡商被扣輪隻、最近雖經日海軍方面陸續釋放、但其釋放原因、並非葡領署交涉之結果、而係含有特殊背景、並附有條件、故各該輪公司事前均未接洽、各輪釋放後、迄今均仍停泊浦江、不獲開航、各情已誌昨報、至福祿利寳等輪仍在被扣中、茲經大光社記者探誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>日方釋放　各輪眞相</p>

<p>僅稱、此法專對歐局而擬具討論其他反響、猶屬過早、中立法禁連軍火條款未廢止時、政治家誠摯聆取全國人民對此問題之意見、中立法旣已修正、美國在金融上、大有裨益、蓋工廠重開、將儸用大批人、製造貨物、供給協約國也、</p>

<p>再美國將有更優良之技術上準備、若有任何威脅、卽可自衛、據渠之見、美國絕大多數人均反對希特勒而頗擁護協約國、擁護協約情緖之發生、大多與同情捷克與波蘭有關、該兩國乃世界大戰後、因美國主張一切民族自决之理論而產生者</p>
<p>總統競選　難以預測</p>

<p>難民技能</p>
<p>等細目、本市委員會得此間與海外慈善團體之助、刻仍照顧已登記之猶太難民一萬六千餘人、且日以三餐供給難民七千餘人、備收容所六所、以供住宿云、按馬氏此行赴馬尼刺、至少將勾留四週、</p>

<h3>新光與聯華訟案　馮耿光請再審　再審被吿聲請公示送達　意圖朦訴債務之責　昨審辯論終結聽候宣判</h3>
<p>新華銀行董事長馮耿光、前與羅明佑黎民偉等合資開設聯華影片公司、總公司設在香港、並掛英商招牌、羅明佑任經理、馮耿光黎民偉均任董事、該公司出品頗多、於民國二十六年春與新光大戲院簽訂合同、該公司所製之影片、新光</p>
<p>有初映權</p>
<p>而新光並向聯華提供保證金二萬元、嗣聯華因停止製片、故無新片交新光放映、後來新光大戲院經理芮慶榮、延袁仰安律師具狀第二特院民庭、訴請判令羅明佑·馮耿光·黎民偉等、連帶返還保證金現款一萬四千元、及未兌現之支票六千元、該案法院審訊時、因馮耿光之住址不明、依法</p>
<p>公示送達</p>
<p>結果判決羅明佑·馮耿光·黎民偉等應返還原吿芮慶榮國幣一萬四千元、並准予假執行、而馮耿光在中國銀行有股票甚鉅、原吿芮慶榮聲請法院執行馮耿光之股票、馮耿光因聯華公司負債頗鉅、深恐受累、近乃延蔡汝棟律師具狀第二特院民庭、提起</p>

<p>意圖朦訴</p>
<p>可以想見、再審被吿知道原吿係中國銀行股東、故意將原吿牽涉在內、其實再審原吿已於民國二十六年八月間脫離聯華公司、現退一步說、聯華影片公司係有限公司、原吿即係股東、亦不能負連帶償還債務之責、應請鈞院慶除原判決、駁回再審被吿之訴、繼據被吿芮慶榮之代理律師袁仰安答辯稱、</p>
<p>再審原吿</p>
<p>之代理人所陳述各節、在法律上均不能成爲理由、應請鈞院駁回再審原吿之訴、又據再審原吿之代理律師云、本案兩造當事人均在香港、聞由杜月笙從中調停、有和解希望、庭上核詞、論令辯論一過、宣吿審結、聽候判決、</p>

<h3>碧血花叙</h3>
<p>— 春蠶</p>
<p>「碧血花」是歷史劇，如晦先生是歷史家。以歷史家來寫歷史劇，當然是能够勝任愉快的。</p>
<p>照我外行人的說法，戲劇在給人們以「鑒賞」之外，還應該給人們以「鑑戒」，允其是在此時此地。碧血花給人們的鑑戒是什麼呢？明末的情形，大不同於現在，第一個關係當然在這時候還是皇家專制的時代。因爲專制時代末路的君權是旁落的，所以不能產生最高的賢明領袖。弘光帝不用說了，隆武帝雖有恢復的雄心，但爲軍閥鄭芝龍所牽制，終於一事無成。又因爲專制時代的民衆是渙散的，所以不能產生偉大前進的政黨。復社式的名流是不足以担當天下大事的，最好的人才像孫武公，也只能孤軍奮鬥而死。旣沒有最高的賢明領袖來主持一切軍務政務，又沒有偉大前進的政黨來普遍地宣傳民衆，訓練民衆，組織民眾，當然這時候的抗戰是沒有前途的。現在，却大大的不同了。</p>
<p>蔡如蘅這個人物，照「板橋雜記」原文上講起來，我們現在是有些寃屈他的。他是一個榮任廬州兵備道而城陷不能死節的官僚，他是一個以三千金奪人所愛的强有力的勢豪，然而，他沒有做漢奸。現在，沒奈何把他寃屈上了。「身後是非誰管得，滿邨聽唱蔡中郞」，我們只好以此爲解嘲吧。但是，我所認爲主要的，是在蔡如蘅的模特兒上面，可以看得出某一種的嘴臉來！</p>

<h3>席勒誕生一八〇週年紀念</h3>
<p>— 歐之</p>
<p>約翰，佛里特里赫，席勒，這位德國偉大的詩人，戲劇家，今年十一月十日是他的誕生一百八十週年紀念。</p>
<p>在他的祖國，當希特勒執掌政權之後，一切呼喊自由的作家，即使是幾百年前的古典作家，也在「法辦」之列。海湼的詩册被常衆焚燒，歌德的劇本被列入有害文學，席勒的戲劇被「勸吿」停止上演。</p>
<p>今年年初，當席勒的「威康退爾」在柏林一個戲院上演的時候，因爲舞台上傳出了詩人的警句：「我們要和我們的祖先一樣自由，旣然活着不自由，不如死的好！」沒有自由的法西斯治下的觀衆，用全塲熱烈的掌聲回答了這爲自由而鬥爭的號召。形成了政治的示威。</p>
<p>因此，竟有「帮閒」的所謂「作家」向德國秘密政治警察局提出了對於這位逝世已經一百三十四年的詩人的控吿！所控吿的罪狀是：違害國家罪，從容弒君罪，倡行孤獨主義罪，自由主義罪。</p>
<p>被開除國籍的海湼，在蘇聯獲得了新的祖國（不久蘇聯詩人决定接受海湼入蘇聯籍），被迫害的席勒，在國外受着人們的歡迎和擁戴。甚至在中國，在這已經形成孤島的上海，在劇藝社的劇目上，也出現了席勒的名劇：「戀愛與陰謀」。爲了表示紀念這位呼喊自由解放的，被一部分反動人們迫害着的大詩人大戲劇家席勒的一百八十年誕生紀念，我們希望這劇能早早演出。</p>
<p>席勒以一七五九年十一月十日生於德國韋爾敦倍格的馬爾巴赫。他的父親是一個軍醫官。席勒自小也被卡爾，葉夫格尼公爵强迫派進軍事學校讀書。</p>
<p>當他還在學校的時候，他便寫成了一部著名的劇本「强盜們」，於一七八一年自費出版。俄國大批評家倍林斯基說：「『强盜們』像從靑年的，熱情的靈魂的深處所迸發出來的熔岩一樣。」它獲得極大的成功，但引起了卡爾，葉夫格尼公爵的懲罰，他禁止席勒寫作。席勒便逃到曼恩海姆去，一七八四年又演出了「戀愛與陰謀」。據恩格斯說，這「戀愛與陰謀是「德國第一部有政治傾向的劇本」。</p>
<p>席勒逃出斯杜格特之後，好幾年各處流浪，生活很潦倒。</p>
<p>席勒的第二時期，是在伊英大學當歷史敎員。那時他著作了「荷蘭衰落史」，「三十年大戰史」和許多哲學美學論文一九十年代末葉，席勒又重新著作詩文，出現了他的名著「鐘的歌」，和古典劇：三部曲「瓦倫斯教」（一七九八年演出），「馬利亞，史之阿特」（一八〇〇年）和「奧林處女」（一八〇一年）。此外，還有一八〇三年的梅新姑娘」，一八〇四年的「威廉退爾」。</p>
<p>他後期的作品，尤其是「威廉退爾」是描寫人民反抗壓迫者的鬥爭，一部分類似「强盜們」，號召爲自由爲獨立而鬥爭。</p>
<p>熱愛人類，相信光明的未來，創造德國的古典戲劇，偉大的戲劇藝術的成就，使席勒成爲世界文化的最偉大的天才之一。</p>
<p>席勒於一八〇五年逝世，享年只四十六歲。</p>
<h3>鬧市散記</h3>
<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>一，夜行</p>
<p>從鬧市歸來我帶着滿臉的塵灰，十一月的風寒掠上了面龐，我有些冷意。</p>
<p>行人依然忽忙地來往，路燈淡淡地射着。</p>
<p>路旁的梧桐樹時時扔下落葉，步道上，行人踏上去喳喳的。</p>
<p>夜行的心境像蒙着濃霧似的沉重，袋裹的錶子不斷地奏着它的行進曲。我想去找一個遼闊的廣塲看看深夜的月亮，但是，鬧市的煩囂沒有一刻的歇止，朝着無盡長的夜街我倒厭恨了夜生活者的閑情。周圍散佈俄羅斯浮浪漢的醉態和酒吧間中無恥的俚歌呵。</p>
<p>街頭，我驚異地和一位來自鄕土的熟客握手了。</p>
<p>「你好！甚麼時候到上海來？」「嗯！就是前幾天吧。眞巧極，碰見了你！」</p>
<p>緊緊地拉着他的手，凝視着他的臉，靜聆着熟悉的鄕音。不過，他瘦了，髮髭裹看去依稀還染着故鄕沙原的塵灰。</p>
<p>「吿訴你：你懷念到韓江之畔的音訊嗎？現在小林和老陳關在××憲兵司令部；罪名是：違抗他們！」</p>
<p>好些人擠過我的身旁，他急促地向我耳邊說話。不時，他回頭來瞧着一家商店門口的時計。</p>
<p>「我準備天亮時到香港去，決定由陸路去內地，那裏，有我們的宿營地，有我們山地上鐵的隊伍……黃！你怎樣呢？」他輕快地問我。一手扣住我的臂膀，雖然夜更寒凉，我却增漲了內心低壓的血潮，神經在急劇地跳動着，我感到無上的欣慰，溫暖的友情加强了我不少戰鬬的意念。</p>
<p>「你，眞的走呢！」</p>
<p>順手從衣袋裹他取出幾封信來，我知道這是內地的某個工作隊的通知書。當他遞了一支烟給我的時候，在一點擦光的洋火下看出他的眼睛正吐着火的烈燄，强烈的復仇的憤恨……</p>
<p>「我想走——」那邊公園的圍牆裏彷彿傳來這麼一聲。…</p>
<p>二，窗下</p>
<p>獨坐於明窗之下，翹望着晴空，江南的秋意竟是這樣地深沉了……</p>
<p>回首在渺漠的天涯，看飄過藍天的浮霞，逗住了一回憶戀。讓黃昏時的蝙蝠馱來夜慕的陰森，爪棚下也存留着我昔年有笑之夢。</p>
<p>「想甚麼呢？你該寫！」</p>
<p>把案頭朋友借來的書看完了，這一册來自故鄕的書本。我會記憶到書架上綏拉菲摩維支的鐵流，高爾基的母親，還有那支伴我十年的鋼筆……</p>
<p>「想甚麽呢？你該寫！」</p>
<p>眼前有稿紙，有家書，執起生疏的筆桿來沉重地，因爲這支筆跟我是缺少緣分的，雖然我願珍愛它，善用它，可是，它對我更是陌生的，滯澀的</p>
<p>把每張翻閱過去，時代的偉大的史詩明顯地擺在我的面前，雖然不欲以個人的傷感去太息以往的煩憂。不過；當你把眼睛極力地張視着的時候，血的腥臭與火的炙炎，搆就了一幅刺目的圖畫更予我以喜悅的歌頌。</p>
<p>於是紙上我開始砌成點點的字句：紅的讚美，火的描繪，鏖戰於古河之邊的壯士底英豪，嶺東雲層下家園的歸思；有高歌，有低唱，在鬧耳的市圖中，我愛它，因爲這是一個難忘而聖潔的奇蹟。</p>
<p>個人嚮往着一串瓏玲的夢幻，夜的跫音默默地從我腌子之前走過。我希冀茫茫長夜後的未來的黎明，浴在黑暗裏我終於喜悅地把稿紙的空格寫完，繼而給了遠方朋友的一封信</p>
<p>「我不喜憧憬古羅馬城頭的月亮，威尼斯市上的行舟，我喜歡埃及的崇高的金字塔，莫斯科莊嚴的紅塲——明日，請你看看中國的坦奪堡上的伙伴的足影，在白雲山巓，在珠江岸邊，鐵的呼吸將翻覆了漫天的霾霧……」</p>
<p>黃昏了，四週動盪着我振奮的歡笑。編者</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>「碧血花」即「明末遺恨」的轟動一時，深入人心，決不是偶然的。劇本及演出的內容與技巧，固然是成功的要件，而觀衆心理上的準備與接受，在我看來尤爲重要。敍文一篇，作者是黨國元老，也就是南社主持人，他的觀察，當然深刻，我想讀者看了此文，都首肯的吧。</p>
<p>前日（六日）本刋後面所排的「羅絲學院」，係廣吿，請讀者不要誤會。</p>
<h3>一些印象</h3>
<p>— 錫金</p>
<p>——由語文展覽會歸來</p>
<p>人類文明的保存與傳佈，端賴語文，我們很難想象，如果人類沒有語文，或者語文還不曾像近代迢樣的進步，那末，我們的近代文明也决不是現在的樣子。</p>
<p>所以，當我們稍稍留意到語文時，我們不由得會想到，人類在語文改進上費過這樣多的精力，每一個地區，每一個種族，都有他們的語文，而且逐漸的改進，一直要達到最合理的最適用的方式。</p>
<p>在語文展覽會中，給我們看到收羅了那樣豐富的各種的語文材料，縱的方面，則自遠古以至今日變遷，橫的方面，則從我們習用的文字以至各國各處的那樣繁多的種類，旁及各種與語文有關的事物，工具，風俗，……不由得不引起我們的硏究興趣，要去知道它，懂得它。許多的古物，以及有美術價值的書法，珍貴，美，也都值得欣賞。</p>
<p>這是一個盛大的學術性質展覽會，但道是每一個市民可以知道和應該知道的學識，許多的方言表演，盲啞表演，也增添不少興趣。</p>
<p>從這裏面，我們看到了原始的語文，和現代語文的向前進展，再進展。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>西北公司戰後復活　「華北是我們的」攝製竣事</h3>
<p>— 翠屛</p>
<p>現在晋省主持軍務的閻錫山將軍，於民國二十四年間曾斥資十萬元，成立西北影片公司，聘請前曾在聯華，天一服務的石寄圃君主持廠務。當時購置新式攝影機械，建築攝影塲，聲勢頗爲浩大，先拍了幾部側重地方性的敎育短片，成續尙稱不惡，後攝製一部歷史長片「壯志千秋」，閻氏及晋省軍界要人，都獻身片中，但石君兼有別種牽掣未能畫責，片只攝得一半；而攝成的部份，又以光綫灰黯，遂成廢片，西北公司亦由此暫吿停頓，那時被羅致的人物有導演王斌·編劇宋之的·演員王蘋·田方等，後雖有重振旗鼓之說，終未見實現。</p>
<p>全面抗戰發動以後，閻氏深感要求達到抗戰的勝利，軍事之外，宣傳亦屬重要，而電影更是最能接近大家的宣傳利器，爰於去歲又將西北公司復活，定名西北電影公司，由梁延武任廠長，溫松康任製片部長，此外職演員大多是昔日明星·聯華·藝華公司的人馬，學識經騐，都很豐富，故雖因地處邊壤，機械不甚完全，但每個人生活，工作，都極能在艱苦環境裏奮鬥。</p>
<p>一年以來，他們完成了一部有眞實性而有系統的國防片「華北是我們的」，中間將抗戰以來的晋省，軍事上的鬥爭情形，實際攝影穿揷進去，與有戲劇性的情節聯繫成一個國防故事影片，技術成績是達到了一般國防片的水準之上。</p>
<p>「華北是我們的」最近運到了重慶，公開招待文化界參觀，衆口一詞的批評，這是一部合乎理想國防片。這片子，留在孤島的同胞，一時自然沒有眼福可以看到的，這裏，特將我們所得知的故事梗概，紀錄如後：</p>
<p>號角聲裏。</p>
<p>騾駝負着沉重的軍需，拖上西北的窩原，幾個驟夫，微揚着鞭子。白的雪，紅的血，裝飾着壯麗的山河，西北的健兒，就在這些雪堆裏血泊中戰鬥，保衛了我們的華北！</p>
<p>呂梁山，太行山，遍地是山，在每一個山裏預備了敵人的火葬塲，黃河泛濫着洪流……中華民族怒吼了！</p>
<p>游擊隊員在山頭上、在戰壕裹，拿着武器瞭望着，槍聲，砲聲，吶喊聲，一切都在跳動。</p>
<p>滿山遍野的人羣，向前衝，民衆們成隊的等待着，等待救護我們的傷兵，男的在挑茶送水，婦女們在縫紉補洗，兒童在檢查路票……</p>
<p>被俘虜過來的人不倦的學習着，工作着，製作了無數的反戰傳單來暴露侵略者弱點。他們同我們携着手來反對他們窮兵黷武的軍閥，共謀中華民族的解放和他們人民的解放！</p>
<p>城市，被侵略者摧毀了偉大的建築——藝術化的窰洞像高大的樓房，到處林立着，裏面在開着盛大的小組會，檢討會，行政會，軍政民運會……的會議，朱閻兩總司令長官在緊握着手，像兩部偉大的發動機。</p>
<p>自衛隊，婦女隊，兒童團，工人，農人，各種救國會，像鐵的隊伍聚集着，活動着，歌聲震動了原野。</p>
<p>堅壁淸野，不容他人吃一點水，拆路拆城，不讓他人佔到一點便宜電流在閃動，像觀衆的心在跳躍，熱血沸騰，一幕接一幕，在各僩鏡頭裏，有雄偉的故事，有美麗的圖畫，有熱烈的眞情，有酸辛，有奮激……華北抗戰的具體事實，顯明的表現在我們的眼前指出了「華北是我們的」！</p>
<h3>大鐘劇社　兩劇團公演預報</h3>
<p>在過去，「中法劇社」中於組織力量的不够，在必然的情狀下，終於解體了，而隨着中法劇校的停閉。也是在我們意料中的事，由於這同一體系的二個戲劇幹部的破產，而無疑地加强了「大鐘劇社」組織的力量。</p>
<p>大鐘劇社的成立，正當是「阿Q正傳」公演之時，起先祗是幾個上海各大學的學生在負責直至「中法劇社」的解體，終於加進許多曾經受過將一年訓練的中法劇校學生，自然，大鐘劇社主親力量的增加是可想而知的了。最近據說在月之十二日晨，於璇宮劇院將作第一次的實騐公演了，在我們不能說不是個可喜的消息。</p>
<p>這次公演的節目，除了吳天所編之「走」，班珂原著之「白茶」，湼羅泊爾原著之「古　之暮」三獨幕劇外，更有陳歌辛伴奏，以及已離滬之吳曉邦原作之舞踊二齣。無疑的這是保持着前「中法劇校」唯一的舞蹈特色，參加的工作人員和演員，「中法劇校」的學生，佔據了相當的多數。所以演出成績的美滿，是可以預期的。（向良冰）</p>
<h3>保聯劇團</h3>
<p>莫利哀的喜劇「慳吝人」，在中國先前商務有過一個譯本，但始終沒有被搬上過中國的舞台，直到最近上海劇誼社在璇宮作經常的演出，這劇本才由顧仲彝的改編，以「生財有道」的名字與我們相見過一次，接着辣斐的「影聯」也以「守財奴」的名字，再度的搬上了「辣斐」，不說這些改編的東西是吾有改編者的意思中和在內，但以演出時都用有莫利哀原著的字樣，祇少說應有三種不同的脚本了。</p>
<p>現在據說顧譯的「生財有道」又將被二次的搬演了，搬演的是一個業餘的保聯劇團，是上海保險界業餘聯誼會所組織的，過去曾參加慈善公演中演出「日出以前」，在業餘劇團中是粗具規模的一個團體，導演也是會經主演過劇藝社「生財有道」的吳銘小姐，料想成績也不致怎樣壞。</p>
<p>關心「此時此地」上海劇運的人們，聽到這消息也許會欣喜的，現在他們是已決定本月十二日在卡爾登上演了。（汶）</p>
<h3>李麗昨過滬返港——不久來滬冉上銀幕</h3>
<p>北平李麗前　忽然出現於仙樂舞宮，人們都很詫異着，原來她這次游美歸國，道經上海，順便逗留一宵，會晤她的故舊。昨晨仍乘原輪柯立芝總統號返港，她丰姿依然嬌艷，服裝尤爲新奇，她說返港拼擋一切，不久仍將來滬加入某影業公司，回復其銀幕生活。這一位影舞雙棲的女人，行踪飄忽，東奔西走，不知所忙何事？眞是怪有趣的，上圖即其最近倩影。</p>
<h3>吳素秋再度登臺　—已由空談而成為事實—</h3>
<p>— 梅簃</p>
<p>美坤伶吳素秋，又將與吾人相見於紅氍毺之上矣，下走與吳藝員晤面之機會較多，因之對於其最近之行動，與其將來上演後之消息，亦較爲詳盡，擇要記錄，以吿讀者</p>
<p>吳藝員自滬上更新演出走紅後，各地劇院，均爭來邀聘，最近接到之函件，計有靑島大連哈爾濱香港遼寗等五六家，而滬上新華公司。亦屢以拍攝古裝電影相勸勉，顧素秋北歸之念甚切，新華一局，擬待諸來春再作定奪，惟對於哈爾濱之的，年內頗有實現可能，因秋初來滬之前，雙方早有成約故也。</p>
<p>此次在更新再度登台，已由空談而成爲事實，言明演期至多爲八天至十天，俟梁韻秋十日滿期後，准由素秋繼續出演，三天打泡戲已作初步決定，計第一天（十一日）爲一芙蓉劍」，第二日星期，應演兩工，白天爲「春秋配」「巴駱和」雙齣，夜戲爲荀派名劇「張玉貞」，第三日非「人面桃花」，即「女打棍出箱」，據伊吿人，本人自演劇以來，對於巴駱和一劇，最感興趣，因劇中有耍槓子與特別開打諸武工，在古都每次露演，售座必特別擁擠，此次在滬上演，駱宏勛一角，上半擬特煩陳少霖客串，下半部因有重要開打，非請梁慧超擔任斯角不勝任勝愉快。素秋在滬，人緣至爲融洽，虞洽卿黃金榮袁履登張嘯林龐萊臣俞葉封張顏山諸君，俱一致獎許，誠坤伶界之天縱驕子也。</p>
<p>路明近在藝華主演新片「香江歌女」，圖爲陷入情網之煩惱情景，此片不久將在新光公映。</p>
<h3>王玉蓉登臺第一聲</h3>
<p>— 珏</p>
<p>轟動已久，膺聘黃金獻藝之王玉蓉女士，果於上月杪，偕其業師老供奉王瑤卿氏，及大批平角蒞臨矣。玉蓉離申十載，今竟藝成南旋。七日首夕打砲戲爲王寳釧，自跑坡起革登殿止。配以著名鐵嗓鬚生楊寳森之薛平貴，故更精彩萬分，未至八時，黃金座上，已吿客滿。余入院時，適後起名凈裘盛戎演牧虎關。裘爲該臺之紅底子，再加特別賣力，自受臺下歡迎無疑。裘後爲吳彥衡之棲梧山，斯劇乃岳飛收復何元慶本事，海上未見有多演者。吳飾主角何元慶，扎大靠，戴翎子，掛寳劍，上塲起壩，唱吹腔，嗓甜韻厚，頗有味道；而腰腿亦見功夫，身上之邊式，武工之穩練有勁，不失爲楊派典型。玉蓉簾內一聲有勞了，即獲全堂彩聲，足證同情者衆，大段慢板，巧腔迭出，二六流水，介口對唱等，令人可愛，且愈唱愈有力，而寳森嗓音充實，尙能合弦不亂，頗得襯托之妙。算糧白口流利，身段救步，俱不錯，而扮相之穩重端莊，尤爲俗伶所不及。登殿唱做，都臻上乘。再佐以寳森之賣力。桐珊仲仁等爲之輔，王瑤卿之親自監塲，更加生色不少。玉蓉一鳴驚人，又得老王如此愛護，亦足豪矣。</p>

<h3>Vietnamese French Authorities Officially Announce Cancellation of Restrictions on Shipment of Chinese Goods, Only German Goods Are Subject to Restrictions, All Circles in Chongqing Express Welcome</h3>
<p>Kunming: According to news from here, the Vietnamese French authorities have officially notified the Chinese Consul General in Hanoi that the restrictions on the shipment of Chinese goods from Haiphong have been cancelled. Currently, only German goods are subject to restrictions. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: All circles of Chinese people here have expressed welcome for the decision of the Vietnamese government to cancel the restrictions on the shipment of Chinese goods from Haiphong, considering this as another proof that the French and Vietnamese governments are willing to assist China in resisting Japan. Since all the major Chinese seaports have been blockaded or occupied by the Japanese, Vietnam has become the most important center, where supplies coming from overseas are unloaded and then transported to China via Kunming or Zhennanguan. It is heard that the Japanese have exerted pressure on the French and Vietnamese authorities to prevent the Chinese from using the location as a cargo transport base. The general Chinese population believes that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands is closely related to the pressure on Vietnam. Recently, the Vietnamese authorities promulgated regulations restricting the shipment of Chinese goods from Haiphong, which resulted in the suspension of supplies transported to China through the location. This action aroused speculation among the general public about France's policy towards the Sino-Japanese situation. Later, there was news that France's actions were due to the outbreak of the European war and were not entirely related to the situation in the Far East. However, after the Chinese people here received official notification from the French authorities that the above-mentioned regulations had been cancelled for the Chinese Consul General in Haiphong, with only German goods still subject to restrictions, they were all very gratified.

<h3>Japanese Newspapers Advocate Alliance with Soviet Union Against America, Oppose American Naval Expansion Program, Advocate Establishment of Friendly Relations Between Soviet Union and Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today launched new attacks on the United States, especially opposing the American naval expansion program and Senator Pittman's threat yesterday to ban the export of military supplies to Japan. Japanese newspapers condemned the recent actions of the United States against Japan as "attempts to threaten Japan," saying that Japan cannot be intimidated by the United States and declared that Japan must carry out the "New Order in East Asia" plan. The Asahi Shimbun claimed, "Even if Japan resists the United States and causes huge waves to surge on both sides of the Pacific, Japan does not intend to yield an inch." At the same time, the Hochi Shimbun, reflecting the views of the Japanese Army, advocated signing a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact and suggested that the two countries should establish close economic relations. The newspaper also warned third countries, especially the United States, not to frequently exert pressure on Japan, as this action will promote closer relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. The newspaper also changed its past anti-Soviet attitude and advocated establishing close relations with the Soviet Union. This indicates that the attitude of the Japanese Army towards the Soviet Union has changed. A few weeks ago, the Japanese Army vowed to maintain an unyielding hatred towards the Soviet Union, but in the past two weeks, it was heard that army officers claimed, "Japan no longer needs to fear the Soviet Union because the Moscow government no longer represents the Communist International." The Hochi Shimbun also stated that Japan and the Soviet Union must sign a non-aggression pact "to avoid them being forced to take the last resort." The newspaper continued, "Although the recent Soviet-Japanese border negotiations on Outer Mongolia and Manchukuo cannot achieve permanent peace between the two countries, the two countries must establish formal friendly relations. Delineating the northern border may prevent Soviet troops from inadvertently invading Manchukuo, but this measure must require the Soviet Union to abandon its Asian expansion policy. We, however, believe that delineating the border still cannot fundamentally eliminate the border instability between Japan and the Soviet Union. As for the signing of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan, it may arouse suspicion and jealousy from democratic countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. However, since Japan does not intend to conclude offensive and defensive pacts or form a military alliance to share the same fate with the Soviet Union, third countries have no reason to condemn Japan. In the United States or Britain continuing to drive Japan and the Soviet Union into a closer relationship, this pact will be a major mission imposed on Japan and the Soviet Union to adjust the complex relationship between the two countries."

<p>Tokyo: Regarding reports that the Netherlands intends to request the United States to take care of its East Indian colonies in the event of an unexpected incident resulting from the aftermath of Europe, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a criticism, stating that if the above-mentioned reports are true, the decision on this matter will be entirely up to the United States. There are many rumors about Japan's southward advance, but they are all based on fantasy and have no basis. Japan is only concerned with expanding commerce and securing methods to protect Japan's commercial interests there, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also stated in response to a question that the date of the second meeting between Foreign Minister Nomura and U.S. Ambassador Grew, as well as the date on which Anglo-Japanese talks will continue, have not yet been firmly decided. A certain reporter also asked about U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's prediction that if U.S.-Japan relations do not improve by January 26 of next year, when the trade treaty between the two countries expires, the United States will undoubtedly pass a resolution authorizing the President to prohibit exports to Japan. The spokesperson replied that, according to his observations, Pittman's mention of prohibiting exports is not new, as Pittman has made such statements from time to time since last year. He believes that the warning issued by Republican Senator Vandenberg after Pittman is sufficient to represent the views of the Republican Party and the majority of the American people. The spokesperson also mentioned the $130 million naval expansion plan proposed by Vincent, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Naval Affairs Committee, saying that although the contents of this plan are still unknown, if it is implemented, Japan cannot ignore it. The spokesperson continued that the current atmosphere in Japan indicates that the whole country is concentrating efforts to seek peace and harmony in U.S.-Japan relations, but if anti-Japanese bans, as threatened by Pittman, are put into effect, this atmosphere may undergo a sudden change. The spokesperson concluded that the main characteristic of the current situation in East Asia is that there is still a large-scale war in China. Whether it is because we have already declared war, Japan is currently at war, and due to the circumstances, several extraordinary events have occurred one after another. Most of the outstanding problems are caused by this large-scale war. (Eighth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Philippine Residents Petition to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Manila: Five organizations, including the Democratic Collective Security Congress, the Democratic Political Defense League, the China Friendship Congress, the Philippine Youth Federation, and the Chinese Youth Association, sent representatives today to submit three volumes of signature books with 48,000 signatures advocating that the United States boycott Japanese goods to U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre, along with a petition. Sayre will forward the petition to Washington but said that the legal basis for the boycott movement must be determined by the U.S. State Department. While the State Department has not decided on this issue, Philippine law regarding the movement still applies. The petition stated, "The U.S. President and Congress recently amended the neutrality status of the United States. In Europe, it has taken the initiative to benefit countries that have been militarily invaded. It is reasonable to develop a law that is equally beneficial to the invaded in the Far East. In short, all the reasons advocated by the U.S. Congress and various newspapers for amending the neutrality law equally apply to the Far East. Furthermore, the Philippine people cannot help but be surprised and uneasy about the fact that the Japanese army and navy are gradually approaching the Philippine Islands in their crazed actions in the Far East."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of the Tensions and Relaxations in Japanese-American Relations</h3>
<p>The United States' response to Japan's aggressive policies in the Far East has become increasingly apparent and concrete recently: In late July, it announced that it would abolish the current US-Japan Commercial Treaty from January 26th of next year; it also gradually strengthened its naval and air forces in the Pacific to demonstrate its international commitment; and now there are widespread rumors that it plans to impose an arms embargo on Japan immediately after the commercial treaty expires next year. With the evolution of the US attitude, it is believed that US-Japan relations will inevitably be redefined in the coming months. The Japanese government, in order to adjust relations between the two countries, appointed Foreign Minister Nomura, who has considerable friendship with US government officials, in an attempt to open a new path through his personal connections. This last resort has apparently not been effective so far. Last month, the US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, frankly and directly expressed the United States' determination to protect its interests in China at a meeting of the US-Japan Society, and denied Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia." Japanese political and public opinion circles have also indicated that the United States' understanding of the Far East is insufficient, and that it is not easy to improve relations between the two countries; however, the Japanese Foreign Minister finally invited Ambassador Grew for exploratory talks last weekend. Not only did Ambassador Grew not change his attitude at all, but he also presented his speech as a written note to him in person. Yesterday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry sent special envoy Kato to Shanghai to engage in activities, and it is said that he intends to negotiate with the US Consul General and others there. The fact that the Japanese government is going to such lengths to find ways everywhere is enough to show its deep anxiety about US-Japan relations.</p>
<p>In fact, the relationship between the United States and Japan is not that complicated. What the United States asks for is only to preserve the existence of the Nine-Power Treaty, continue to maintain the Open Door Policy, and prevent its interests in China from being harmed. If Japan can abandon its ambition to monopolize the Far East and stop fantasizing about creating a "New Order in East Asia," then US-Japan relations can easily be adjusted amicably. However, Japan does not plan to do this: it believes that the outbreak of the European war will reduce the power of Britain and France in the Far East, and estimates that the United States does not have a strong will or fixed policies; therefore, Japan not only does not respect the rights and interests held by the United States, and engage in adjusting the relations between the two countries, but instead wants the United States to accommodate its ambitions. It asks the United States to abandon its interests in China and tear up the Nine-Power Treaty in exchange for a true recognition of Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia"; it even hopes that the United States will help it complete the construction of the so-called New Order economically.</p>
<p>At present, Japan's work to adjust its diplomatic relations with the United States is still adopting the old methods of the past. In addition to publicizing pro-A and pro-B sentiments to put pressure on the United States, it only uses some small tricks in order to gain an absolutely favorable position. For example, it often uses extremely hypocritical and clumsy rhetoric to once again declare that it absolutely respects the United States' interests in China and is willing to compensate for appropriate claims for losses; but in reality, it will never abandon its policy of excluding the forces of third countries in China. It uses "established facts" as the basis of its jurisprudence, such as using force to create Japanese interests in China, and using them to confront the United States' interests in China; the interests it created in Northeast China earlier have already prevented the development of the economic forces of third countries; and now it wants to use various economic constructions in the occupied areas as new tools to exclude the interests of Europe and the United States in China. In addition, it also wants to use the magic of deceiving ignorant women and children, and demand that the United States not negotiate with Japan on all the pending issues between the United States and Japan since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but negotiate with the puppets created by Japan. The other day, the East Daily News advocated that the United States should wait until the so-called "New Central Government" is established before negotiating on issues such as the material prices set by the Chinese customs, the Pingyu Railway, and the navigation of the Yangtze River. This is not only a complete evasion of Japan's responsibility to the United States, but also intends to induce the United States to implicitly recognize the international status of the puppet organization. What a ridiculous plan this is!</p>
<p>The diplomatic policy of the United States has always been very clear; how can Japan's little tricks actually conceal the eyes and ears of the American people! Even the so-called threat of war may not be able to make American isolationists fear Japan, let alone anything else. Many Japanese people believe that the US diplomatic policy focuses on practical benefits; US trade with Japan and investment in Japan are both greater than those with China. In fact, who does not know that Japan's annexation of China is the first step in the decline of US-Japan trade; Japan's exclusive control of China means that Japan has the possibility of threatening the United States. Even in the near future: the construction and reconstruction of China after the War of Resistance will inevitably be the largest customer of the United States. The other day, the US Foreign Relations Association published a special article advocating economic pressure on Japan, and Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also declared that he would propose to Congress in January next year to ban the sale of arms and raw materials to Japan at any time. This shows that the tense relationship between Japan and the United States cannot be eased by Japan's small tricks. Whoever tied the knot must untie it. Only Japan can reflect on itself; and the clear and concrete response from the United States can prompt Japan to reflect, which is the mystery of the Far East!</p>
<h3>Germany Withdraws Elite Troops and Assembles on the Dutch Border; Neutral Holland and Belgium Feel Threatened; The Two Countries Take Self-Defense Measures</h3>
<p>The Hague: People in the Netherlands and Belgium are aware that the security and neutrality of the two countries are still uncertain. Both countries have now mobilized. The Netherlands has flooded some areas and declared a state of emergency in other areas. Belgium is also shocked by the frequent overflights of foreign military aircraft over Belgian airspace. Therefore, the people of both countries have great hopes and support for the actions initiated by their monarchs. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Beijing: According to a Berlin telegram received by the Belgian news agency, elite German troops withdrawn from the Polish battlefield are now stationed in villages and towns along the Dutch border. The German side said that the Siegfried Line could not accommodate so many troops, so they were stationed here. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: According to a dispatch from Beijing last night in the "Exchange Telegraph," a large team of German shock troops is concentrating on the Dutch border, carrying a large number of tanks and chariots. It is reported that most of these shock troops participated in the Polish War. According to observations from diplomatic circles here, the meeting of the monarchs of Belgium and the Netherlands in The Hague was due to the fear of the authorities of the two countries being involved in the vortex of war. It is believed that Hitler currently has two options: (1) to defeat Britain and France at the same time; (2) to abandon France and concentrate on attacking Britain with air force submarines. But no matter which path Hitler takes, Belgium and the Netherlands will inevitably suffer the consequences. If Hitler attempts to defeat Britain and France on the Western Front, it would be most advantageous to pass through Belgium or sweep through the Netherlands and Belgium. If Hitler specializes in attacking Britain with the navy and air force, it would also be advantageous to establish submarine and air force bases on the Dutch coast. After Germany obtains submarine bases on the Dutch coast, the activity capacity of its smaller submarines in the North Sea and the English Channel will be greatly enhanced. At the same time, German reconnaissance planes can easily report the actions of British and French ships to submarines. Furthermore, after Germany obtains Dutch air force bases, German aircraft can more easily launch air raids on Britain. Currently, although German bombers can reach Britain, the journey is too long and fighter planes cannot provide escort. Bombers that are not protected by fighter planes are most easily shot down by enemy fighter planes. This has been clearly demonstrated in the Spanish Civil War, and the recent attack by German aircraft on Scotland, which did not pay off, is enough to prove it. Therefore, it cannot be said that Germany's capture of the Netherlands is impossible. Although the main force of the German army is concentrated in the Saar region, military experts believe that it is not difficult for the German mechanized divisions to launch a rapid offensive against the Netherlands. When Germany invades the Netherlands, whether Belgium will remain neutral or allow British and French troops to enter the country to resist the German army is a question that this country should decide. According to observations from neutral parties here, unless the Belgian government approves, even in such a situation, British and French troops would not be willing to enter Belgian territory without authorization. Belgium and the Netherlands have always been unwilling to establish mutual assistance agreements in order to avoid providing excuses for great powers. But so far, the two countries have felt the need to cooperate with each other. The meeting of the monarchs of Belgium and the Netherlands is a clear indication of their joint response to all incidents. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Activity Over the North Sea; All Repelled by British Naval and Air Forces; Germany Announces Results of Air Combat on the Western Front</h3>
<p>London: The Air Force announced that there were several air activities in the North Sea today. A German aircraft, a "Heinkel" type, flew over the Shetland Islands off the northern coast of Scotland this morning, flying very high. It was driven away by anti-aircraft fire and British aircraft. Shortly after, several other German aircraft appeared in the air. Two of them engaged in a battle with British patrol aircraft in the North Sea far from the coast. The German aircraft then disappeared into the clouds and fled, and it is not known whether they were able to fly back to Germany. All British aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.

<p>London: The Admiralty announced that several British naval light warships, together with two Polish destroyers, fought with German aircraft in the North Sea yesterday. The warships were not damaged, and the number of German casualties is unknown. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Danzig: An air battle between two bombers and twelve fighter planes was discovered in Linkoping, on the west coast of the Jutland Peninsula, today. It is believed that the bombers belonged to Germany and the fighter planes belonged to Britain. After the two sides fought in the air for fifteen minutes, the bombers swooped down and then fled south. It is believed that they flew to the German base in Sylt, and the fighter planes chased them to near the Danish coast before stopping. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced today that the fighting on the Western Front was slightly denser in several sections, and reconnaissance was more active. As for the results of yesterday's fierce battle in German airspace, one British aircraft fell near the mouth of the Wupper River, one French aircraft fell near Volklingen, and three other enemy aircraft were shot down near Saarlautern. A total of nine enemy aircraft have been shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery from the 1st to the 7th of this month. Two German aircraft were damaged and three went missing during these seven days. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: The first major air battle on the Western Front took place on Sunday. It is reported that nine German aircraft were shot down. The "Strong Will Report" was the first to reveal the details. It is said that the air battle was caused by twenty-seven German aircraft demonstrating in the air over the French army's positions. The intention was obviously to use a dense formation to make the French army remember the tragic massacre of people by German aircraft in Poland when they saw it. The enemy aircraft flew at a speed of 300 miles per hour, but as soon as they arrived in French territory, a team of nine French fighter planes took off to intercept them. They first formed a formation that was conducive to attack, and then used their skilled techniques to launch a major attack with guns firing in unison. Ground observers saw seven enemy aircraft crashing to the ground, and several of them were spewing fire. The remaining aircraft scattered and turned back to their own country, and the French aircraft chased after them. Shortly after, two more Messerschmitt German aircraft crashed behind the Siegfried Line. The French air force leader initially thought that they had won the battle, and that the French side could not be without losses, but the French aircraft all flew back, so they were overjoyed. Several French aircraft were pierced by bullets, but there were no casualties. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Sinking of the British Warship "Oak"</h3>
<p>London: The Minister of International Defense Coordination made a speech in the House of Lords this afternoon, explaining the details of the sinking of the battleship "Oak" on October 14. "I, on behalf of the government, use frank words to explain the details of this matter. There are still certain parts that are not convenient to announce in detail, which I hope all members will understand. After investigation, this battleship was indeed sunk by a German submarine on the morning of the 14th of last month after it broke through the defense line of the Scapa Flow naval base. The defense equipment of this naval base includes two types: (1) a water barrier and a blockade line composed of sunken ships; (2) the bay has seven entrances, and each entrance is guarded by a small patrol boat. All these two types of defense equipment have failed to achieve the necessary efficiency to absolutely prevent enemy submarines from attacking. The sinking of the 'Oak' under such circumstances is naturally not completely impossible." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Warships Intercept Swedish Ships</h3>

After German sailors boarded the ship and steered it, it sailed into Swedish territorial waters due to bad weather, and only sailed out of territorial waters after the wind and waves calmed down. It continued sailing south, probably to a German port. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Heads of State of the Netherlands and Belgium Issue a Joint Telegram; Willing to Mediate European Peace; Hope to Work Together in the Spirit of Understanding; Chamberlain Will Make a Statement in His Speech Today</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: After lengthy consultations, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Leopold of Belgium have launched an unexpected peace appeal. The monarchs of the Netherlands and Belgium have telegraphed the belligerent countries to explain their views. The Dutch Foreign Ministry has exceptionally issued a public statement in Dutch, French, English and German, announcing the telegram sent to the belligerent countries, which reads:</p>
<p>"At this time when the world is horrified and uneasy and the Western European war has not yet broken out on a large scale, we have a view that it is our responsibility to speak out again immediately. The belligerent countries have previously declared that they have never been unwilling to study appropriate and sound foundations for obtaining equal peace. From our point of view, in the current environment, it is difficult for the belligerent countries to contact each other in order to state their positions more accurately and to make each other closer. We, as the monarchs of two neutral countries with good relations with neighboring countries, are now prepared to come forward to mediate. If all parties agree, we are willing to use all our methods to make suggestions on what can be suggested, and in a spirit of friendly understanding, to facilitate the adoption of the content of the agreements that can be reached. This, in our view, is the work that we should carry out for the happiness of our people and the interests of the whole world. We hope that our appeal can be accepted and become the first step towards establishing lasting peace."</p>
<p>The public statement announced the meeting of the monarchs of the Netherlands and Belgium and the issuance of the telegram, saying that the monarchs of the two countries decided to telegraph the leaders of Germany, France and Britain in order to facilitate possible negotiations. This move is a new sign of the unity and common understanding of the Netherlands and Belgium. It is now known that the heads of state of the Netherlands and Belgium have secretly contacted each other in the past few days. When the negotiations progressed to a certain extent, the King of Belgium made a trip to The Hague. Now the King of Belgium has returned to Beijing with his Foreign Minister Spaak.</p>
<p>London: When the new Mayor of London holds a banquet at the City Hall on Thursday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a speech on the spot, which will probably elaborate on the peace movement launched by the heads of state of the Netherlands and Belgium today. On that day, the British Prime Minister will not make a statement on the international situation in the House of Commons. It is expected that Secretary of the Navy Churchill's report on naval work will be released in the House of Commons on Thursday. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: The cabinet met this morning to discuss the mediation of the European war by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands. As far as is generally known, the government will exchange views with the French government before submitting a reply. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London: When the House of Commons met today, opposition leader Attlee asked Prime Minister Chamberlain what comments he had on the letter from the heads of state of the Netherlands and Belgium suggesting mediation of peace. The Prime Minister replied that the British government is now carefully studying the letter and that he could not make any comments on it today. Then there were loud cries of "Notice" and "Notice" from the members' seats. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Peace Movement Unlikely to Succeed: A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Britain and France</h3>
<p>London: The mediation of the European war by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands has recently been commented on by various newspapers here. They all said that although this move was out of goodwill, the situation shows that any solution that can suit the minimum goals of the British and French war effort is unlikely to be accepted by Germany. Foreign Secretary Halifax just made a broadcast speech yesterday explaining Britain's war goals, which can be used to answer the appeal made by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands. As for the motivation for this move by the heads of state of the two countries, the newspapers all said that this was caused by the recent greater threats imposed by the German government on its northwestern neighbors. The "Daily Telegraph" carried a report saying, "Germany has exerted great diplomatic pressure on Belgium and the Netherlands, and supplemented it with military threats. But those who do not know that peace that wants to last must establish a glorious peace. At present, there is no slightest clue that all the conditions for a glorious peace have been met. This is because the current war is the result of completely different beliefs and fundamentally conflicting goals between the two sides. It is not caused by a misunderstanding and can be clarified through meetings." The "Times" carried a report saying, "Our war goals have been understood by the world. In essence, we want to free Europe from the constant terror of aggression and enable the nations of Europe to maintain independence and freedom. When the British government replies to this appeal from the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, it should clearly explain these basic principles." The "Daily Mail" carried a report saying that the terms of the armistice for the various democratic countries have long been known to the world. The German Social Party has no signs of accepting these terms at this time. Britain and France have a very firm position. Without sufficient guarantees, how can they rashly accept mediation? Moreover, this so-called guarantee is also of vital importance to the survival of Belgium and the Netherlands." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the mediation of the European war by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, the newspapers here treat it with respect, but do not believe that it can succeed. They all said that to negotiate with Germany at this time is tantamount to acknowledging the established facts it has created and making Europe feel threatened forever. There is no reason to do so. The fact that Belgium and the Netherlands are particularly sensitive to the various consequences caused by this war due to their geographical relationship is a real situation. Moreover, Germany is doing everything possible to impose increasingly heavy pressure on these countries. The "Little Parisian" carried a report saying, "Germany is using blackmail tactics on Belgium and the Netherlands diplomatically and militarily." The "White Day News" carried a report saying, "The heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands are issuing appeals in a distressed tone." The "Order News" carried a report saying, "What the heads of state of the two countries have been striving for is to shift the crisis they are feeling." In addition, a certain newspaper also said that this appeal from the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, whether intentional or unintentional, has actually constituted another stage of the German offensive. The "Business News" said that Germany and the Soviet Union issued a joint declaration on September 29, saying that they should strive to promote the participation of non-belligerent countries in this peace offensive in the future, but in reality they have run into walls everywhere. Belgium and the Netherlands decided to take on the role of mediator because of their difficult situation. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Authorities Study Closely; Hitler Went to Munich Yesterday to Attend the Anniversary Meeting of the National Socialist Party</h3>
<p>Kovno: When the telegram from the Netherlands and Belgium on reconciliation arrived in Berlin, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Göring were attending the celebration of the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet revolution at the Soviet Embassy in Germany. After receiving the telegram, Hitler immediately summoned Ribbentrop to the palace to discuss it. They discussed this peace proposal for a long time. Hitler then went to Munich to attend the anniversary meeting of the National Socialist Party. When General Göring was asked by reporters about the United States supplying aircraft to the Allied countries, he replied, "If our country's aircraft production is not faster than the United States, then we will be very weak." (Reuters, 8th) Amsterdam: The newspapers here said that Germany must wait for Hitler to decide on a solution before it can express its practical attitude towards the peace movement proposed by the heads of state of the Netherlands and Belgium. However, the Berlin dispatches of the newspapers all said that the first impression caused by the peace movement was quite good. Before this was launched in the Netherlands and Belgium, German newspapers criticized the attitude of the Netherlands and Belgium towards "British maritime dictatorship" and said that what the Netherlands was upholding was one-sided neutrality. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The newspapers and wireless telegraphs here all published the full text of the telegram from the Netherlands and Belgium on reconciliation, but did not comment on it. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Britain's War Aims: Defending Freedom and Peace; Firm Belief that Justice Will Triumph Over Violence; British Foreign Secretary's Broadcast Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered a radio address last night, providing a clear response to the question of what Britain's true purpose is in the current war. He stated that we are now fighting for freedom and peace. We are now resisting a challenge that endangers our safety and that of others. We are now defending the right of all nations to live in peace and prosperity. There are those who wish to replace law with violence to resolve issues between nations, destroy the dignity of treaties, and disregard falsehoods. This is also what we are fighting against today. We have learned that Europe cannot have the opportunity to cultivate the arts of peace unless Germany understands that the repetition of acts of aggression will not be tolerated. Therefore, we must make a firm determination not only to protect ourselves from the harm that German acts of aggression have inflicted on Europe in recent years, but also, to the extent that we can, to repair the damage that Germany has repeatedly inflicted on its weaker neighbors. All who know the brutal actions of the violent elements in Germany that destroy the people will make this purpose even stronger. Generally speaking, one country cannot interfere in the internal affairs of another. Interference ultimately leads to failure, as history has shown time and again. Britain is unwilling to interfere in the affairs of others, and only asks that others not interfere in its affairs. But since Germany has challenged the most fundamental rights of humanity in the realm of international relations as it does today, this challenge cannot be tolerated by anyone with humanity. We therefore rise up to fight to uphold the legal standards and benevolent nature of dealing with human and civilized society. My hope that war could be honorably avoided has ultimately vanished. There are only two ways to deal with disaster: resist or tolerate. There is no other option. Tolerating is not an honorable act. I feel deeply in my conscience that nothing but the greatest disgrace could prevent war. Now, the greatest disgrace and the greatest folly lie on the side of the aggressor. The German government's greatest disgrace is now visible to the world. We are fighting alongside France and Poland with the same ideals and united spirit. With the protection of Heaven, we will have the power to prove the folly of the German government's self-destruction. We will certainly be able to achieve our goals by winning this decisive war. This is beyond doubt. Prime Minister Chamberlain has previously stated that we do not seek a peace of revenge. We ourselves have no territorial ambitions. We deeply believe that there is little hope for the future unless a new peaceful solution is established through negotiations and agreements. The Prime Minister's words are true, but we are also determined, as far as humanly possible, to ensure that Europe does not suffer a repeat of this tragedy. With this aim in mind, we will use our power, when the time is ripe, to create a new world in which nations are not allowed to destroy our hope for a stable life and our trust that we will never again be devastated by reckless force. The new world we seek will be based on the cooperation of all peoples on the foundation of human equality, self-respect, and mutual tolerance. We will then need to re-discuss many social, political, and economic issues in international relations, and seek ways to adapt to the changing needs of this ever-changing world, so as to prevent the disruption of general peace caused by the use of force. All countries must contribute to the order we intend to create, and the great responsibility in thought and action will be borne by our people. Like others, we must learn from our past failures and disappointments. When the war ends, we must unite wisdom and goodwill to undertake the great tasks ahead. In his concluding remarks, the Foreign Secretary stated the need for unity, saying that our responsibility here is as important as the responsibility of the soldiers at the front, that is, to have a united and unwavering will. Our ability to resist and our ability to work for the future of mankind after the armistice all depend on this. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Six Peace Conditions Proposed by the British Labour Party: Germany Must Establish a Trustworthy Government; Abandon Aggression and Submit Disputes to Arbitration; Recognize the Right of Poland and Czechoslovakia to Exist</h3>
<p>London - Labour Party leader Attlee delivered a speech in London today, detailing the Labour Party's peace aims. He stated that the necessary condition for peace is that Germany must have a trustworthy government that abandons Hitlerism, but there must also be evidence of genuine intention and action, such as restoring the civil governments of Czechoslovakia and Poland. A peace conference must be held, and participants must be prepared to abandon aggression and focus on restoring the status quo and correcting past wrongs without the use of force. Therefore, the Labour Party has formulated its objectives as follows: (1) Compensation must be given to the victims, but the concepts of revenge and punishment must be discarded; (2) All countries, regardless of size, color, or creed, must have the right to live and develop their own characteristics, without infringing on the rights of others. Germany must recognize that Poles, Czechs, and Jews have the same right to occupy a place in the world as Germans, and Britain must give the same rights to Indians and other peoples in the British Empire; (3) War must be regarded as an uncivilized act, and all disputes must be submitted to an impartial arbitrator for judgment when necessary; (4) The rights of religious and ethnic minorities must be recognized and protected by the authority of international organizations; (5) An international authority must be recognized that transcends all countries and has the power to implement effective measures in the political and economic spheres. Europe must unite, or we will perish; (6) Imperialism must be abandoned, and the principle that the interests of the indigenous people must be paramount in the administration of colonies that are not yet ready for self-government must be accepted. All countries have equal rights to access markets and raw materials. As for the re-distribution of colonies between opposing imperialist countries, this is not a solution.</p>
<p>If the above principles are accepted, an international organization should naturally be established to implement them, and it must have a powerful international military force to deter aggression. In his opinion, an international air force should be established and all national air forces abolished. All countries must undertake the obligation to impose economic sanctions on those who disrupt the peace. National armies must be reduced to the level necessary to maintain domestic order and be subject to international inspection. Private arms trade and manufacturing must be abolished. Small countries must enjoy the same status as large countries in international authorities. International authorities may deal with border issues and plan economic programs on a global scale to address economic difficulties. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Parliament Approves Mutual Assistance Treaty with Three Nations; Greece and Turkey Resolve to Defend Themselves Jointly; To Ensure Balkan Security</h3>

<p>Athens - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu told reporters here yesterday that Greece and Turkey are both peace-loving and seek peace. "However, if the interests of Greece and Turkey are threatened, the two countries will rise up to defend them." According to local reports, General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the Near East Allied Forces, mentioned the idea of ensuring Balkan peace when negotiating the Franco-Turkish mutual assistance treaty in Ankara. Turkey then expressed to General Weygand that, as far as Turkey is concerned, its foreign policy is the same as that of Greece, that is, Southern Europe and Greece must be regarded as indivisible. When the Soviet Union requested a re-adjustment of the Balkan issue when the Turkish Foreign Minister was in Moscow, he also replied to the Soviet side in this way. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>London - Rome Radio reported that officials confirmed that Romania, Turkey, and Greece have all agreed to hold a conference of the Balkan Entente countries. Yugoslavia, the fourth Entente country, has not yet made an announcement. (Reuters, 8th) Istanbul - Romanian Ambassador to Turkey, Stoia, returned to his country to report on his work.

<h3>22nd Anniversary of the Soviet Revolution; Military Parade Held in Moscow; Red Army Parade Shows Improvement in Military Equipment; Voroshilov Speaks on Soviet Union's Policy of Peace</h3>
<p>Moscow - The working masses of Moscow unanimously celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution today. The city was decorated with flags and colored ribbons. Citizens gathered on the streets early in the morning to prepare to participate in the parade. The stands on one side of the Kremlin Wall in Red Square were packed with spectators by nine o'clock. There were members of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, members of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union and Russia, Soviet heroes, famous Stakhanovite shock workers from Moscow factories, scientists, and artists. Representatives of the National Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, diplomatic corps personnel, military attachés from various countries stationed in the Soviet Union, and domestic and foreign journalists were seated in special seats. Various units of the Red Army participating in the grand military parade were arranged on Red Square. At ten o'clock sharp, People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Voroshilov rode out of the Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower. After listening to the report of the parade commander Marshal Budyonny, he inspected the various units one by one and congratulated the soldiers. All the soldiers and commanders responded with earth-shattering cheers. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Beria, Shvernik, Dimitrov, Malenkov, Shkiryatov, Bulganin, Shcherbakov, Vyshinsky, Yaroslavsky, and other government officials then filed out and ascended the Lenin Mausoleum. After the inspection, Voroshilov stepped onto the podium to address the Red Army soldiers, commanders, and political instructors, the working masses of the country, and the representatives of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus who had just been liberated from the rule of the Polish gentry. Voroshilov first congratulated the 22nd anniversary of the October Revolution, and then stated the Soviet Union's achievements in the economic field in the past year, pointing out that the country's armed forces have been strengthened several times and are a reliable guarantee for the peaceful labor of the Soviet people in the current complex international situation and the state of war in the East and West. After Voroshilov finished his speech, the whole square was filled with thunderous applause. The Red Army units then began to march in formation, passing in front of the podium. First were the representatives of various military academies and special forces schools, followed by infantry battalions with well-equipped and steel-helmeted soldiers, whose majestic military appearance aroused applause and praise from the whole square. Then came the cavalry and motorized units, armored vehicles and tank units, fully demonstrating the improvement in the Soviet Union's military equipment in the past year. The artillery showed particular progress in this area, with its caliber and range greatly increased compared to the past. Most of the heavy artillery was towed by powerful Tizaire engine snail-style tractors. The Red Army's grand military parade lasted for two hours, followed by a mass parade. The working masses of the city marched in formation past the Lenin Mausoleum for several hours. When passing the podium, the parading masses all paid respects to Stalin and the party and government leaders, and shouted slogans, expressing their support for the government's foreign policy and congratulating the people of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus who had newly merged with the Soviet Union. Their enthusiasm fully demonstrated the people's love and trust for Stalin and the government and the Red Army, as well as their determination to repel any enemy who dared to invade the Soviet Union and destroy them on their own soil. The characteristic of this grand parade was the Soviet people's extremely high patriotic sentiment, as well as their firm, unbreakable moral and political unity. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<h3>Voroshilov's Speech: Success of Soviet Diplomacy; The Red Army Marches West</h3>
<p>Moscow - Voroshilov delivered a speech at the Red Army military parade today, first stating the Soviet Union's achievements in various fields over the past year, stating, "The past year has been a year of particularly tense international situation and very frequent events. Our government's far-sighted diplomatic policy, under the guidance of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, has enabled the Soviet Union to stay out of the war, while the major countries in Europe and Asia have been caught in it. The Soviet-German non-aggression treaty has eliminated the danger of our country fighting with Germany, and has disappointed those who want to fish in troubled waters. Our country strives to maintain neutrality and pursues the only correct policy of peace, but our government cannot control everything. Our country is surrounded by capitalist countries, so we must always be vigilant and prepared, especially now. The Soviet government will always pay attention to the development of the international situation and seek timely and appropriate responses." Voroshilov then reviewed the Red Army's entry into the former Polish territory on September 17 under the government's order to protect the lives and property of the people of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, stating, "The Ukrainian and Belarusian front-line troops showed infinite perseverance, full power, mobility, and heroic sacrifice in carrying out the government's orders. All soldiers, commanders, political commissars, and political instructors were loyal to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin and their motherland. They loved the great Stalin, which made the Red Army strong and forever glorious and invincible in the world. A large number of reserve soldiers and officers were replenished a few days before the army began its actions. Although the expansion time was extremely short, the reserve soldiers and commanders were still able to show good actions during the battle. Their spirit and skills in fighting bravely were no less than those of the active soldiers. On the occasion of this National Day, I firmly believe that the people of the whole country will express their sincere gratitude to the officers and political personnel of the Ukrainian and Belarusian front-line troops who completed their tasks and added glory to the Red Flag, and will never forget their great achievements. The Red Army has now resumed peaceful life, but it will continue to work hard in military and political training, just as before. Every soldier, every commander, and political instructor knows that only by mastering modern technologies and using them to fight under complex conditions, and only by improving political education, can we guarantee the people's peaceful and free labor in peacetime for our Red Army and our country, and win victory in wartime. This undeniable fact has been tested not only on the remote Mongolian Khalhin front, but also in the same way. Our army in that area also showed a model of loyalty to the country and to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin. They shouted Stalin's name and charged into the enemy's陣, finally defeating the enemy. The mutual assistance treaties signed by the Soviet government with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have enhanced the military and strategic position of our country and the signatory countries. According to the treaties, our troops stationed in those countries are only sentinels for the gates of those countries and our country, but our troops will not interfere in the sovereignty and internal affairs of those countries. The current international situation is extremely complex and dangerous. An imperialist war has now broken out in the West and echoes the same type of war in the Far East. The world has been set on fire at both ends by imperialists. The largest countries in Europe and Asia have plunged themselves into the whirlpool of war in order to solve the unsolvable problems of capitalism that is on the verge of collapse. The people of our Soviet Union are fortunate to be spared the scourge of war due to the correct foreign policy of the government and the Party Central Committee. This is our happiness, but we must remember that our country must be stronger, and our Red Army and Navy must be more powerful and invincible, so that our government's correct foreign policy can be more successful. Therefore, all our working masses must work harder to increase and improve our work, so that our country will be more prosperous, more civilized, and more invincible. We do not participate in the war, but we must always be vigilant and pay attention to the development of world affairs. Our Red Army and Navy will be ready to fight at any time, and nothing can attack our country unprepared." (TASS, 7th)</p>
<h3>Comintern Secretary Issues Statement Exposing Anglo-French Tricks; Promotes German-Soviet Rapprochement</h3>
<p>Moscow - Comintern Secretary-General Dimitrov published an article in the latest issue of "International Magazine," pointing out that the current war is an imperialist war, and accusing Britain and France of instigating Germany and the Soviet Union in hopes of sparking war. He stated that before the outbreak of war, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had talks, but Britain and France simultaneously tried to alienate Germany and the Soviet Union, and did not give up this attempt until the last hour. This situation has been confirmed by the British government's published white paper, which mentions the conversation between the British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, and the German leader Hitler. However, Germany finally recognized the power of the Soviet Union and refused to use force against the Soviet Union. At that time, Germany had two paths to follow: either become a tool of the imperialists and invade the Soviet Union, risking its own danger, or resolutely improve relations with the Soviet Union to establish peaceful relations. After weighing the advantages and disadvantages, the German authorities finally took the second path. As for the current Second Imperialist War (meaning the previous European War was the First Imperialist War), it can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, the three countries of Italy, Germany, and Japan were the aggressors, while other capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and the United States tried to make concessions in order to avoid a decisive battle. At the same time, they hoped to persuade the aggressor countries to shift their vision and expand their power to socialist countries (referring to the Soviet Union). In the second stage, the British and French imperialists also took an offensive against Germany and used all means to make other countries follow their lead. Therefore, among the European countries, there is no distinction between those who directly engage in aggression and those who encourage other countries to engage in aggression. Among them, the French imperialists have the greatest determination to prolong the war and expand the scope of the war. As for the majority of other capitalist countries, although they have not directly participated in the war, they all practice a false policy of neutrality, especially the United States. For example, that country aims to fuel the fire in the Far East in order to weaken China and Japan, and then submit memorandum-style conditions to both warring parties, thereby strengthening its position in China. In short, the current war is by no means a so-called anti-fascist war. Workers all over the world must unite and fight together for the goals of the Communist Party. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Political Circles Comment on Molotov's Speech; Soviet Union Not Deeply Pro-German</h3>
<p>London - Political circles here claim that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech and the declarations issued by the Third International do not state any new policies, so they should not be given too much importance. The first important point is that Molotov clearly stated in his speech the Soviet Union's neutrality in the current war, and there is no hope that the Soviet Union will more actively join the German side. The second important point is the attack on Germany in the declaration. The Third International has never correctly reflected the Soviet government's new pro-German attitude in its speeches to foreign countries (excluding Germany, of course), but continues to make general attacks on fascism. It is well known that the Third International and the Soviet government are both under Stalin's control. The fact that this phenomenon can be seen now shows that the Soviet government's so-called solidarity with Germany is not very deep. Nazism will of course try to explain the Third International's declaration, but will eventually be annoyed by it. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov made a speech yesterday, in which he mentioned the United States, saying that the American bourgeoisie is very willing to have the European war last for a long time. If so, arms merchants can make huge profits. People in political circles here, after hearing this, commented on it with a sarcastic tone and contemptuous attitude, saying that the Soviet authorities have long openly expressed their hope that wars will occur all over the world in order to complete the world revolution. It is strange that they are now attacking the United States. In addition, the Soviet Embassy in the United States celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the Russian Revolution today, inviting guests. Most people in the United States avoided participating, which is noteworthy. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Geta Condemns Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>Rome - Mussolini's mouthpiece, Geta, today published an article fiercely refuting the Third International's communiqué issued in Moscow on the eve of the twenty-second anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, condemning the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland. It stated, "The Soviet Union's invasion of Poland has led to the expansion of the war zone, and the fact that the war zone has been limited is due to Italy not taking any belligerent action. Italy, not the Soviet Union, is responsible for defending the peace of the Balkan Peninsula, and all of Europe recognizes this. If there is a struggle today between imperialist forces and aristocratic political interests, the Soviet Union is also involved. The Soviet Union is now attempting to use political pressure, as capitalism does, to expand and exploit economic and natural interests. The Soviet Union has never pursued peace; on the contrary, in the past twenty years, it has always regarded war as a matter of urgency, hoping to use this war to create a communist revolution." Geta responded to the Third International's sarcastic remarks that Italy is waiting for a favorable opportunity to join the victors and seize a share of the spoils, saying, "This kind of tendency is currently only seen in the Soviet Union's actions in Poland. Italy's policy is to devote itself to saving European peace with complete openness and sincerity, and will now do its utmost to limit the war and save civilization. The Third International is not qualified to judge Italy." (Eighth Reuters)</p>

<h3>After the Blockade of the Chaoshan Coast, the Local Native Products Industry of Meixian Flourishes, Foreign Goods Have Disappeared from the Market, and a Revivalist Scene Has Formed Among the People</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - Since the coastal areas were blockaded by Japanese warships, foreign goods have been unable to be transported into the Chaoshan and Meizhou hinterland. The remaining imported goods in various shops are generally priced at the current exchange rate and freight, and the prices are raised high. For example, 20-count foreign yarn, which was 350 yuan per piece before the war, now costs 1,200 yuan. Since yarn prices are so high, the locally woven cloth is also expensive. The prices of all other types of piece goods have also risen uniformly. Even the old clothes in pawnshops and second-hand clothing stores are selling at ten times their original prices. The price of kerosene has also risen from 5 yuan to 20 yuan per can. Rural families no longer light lamps at night, or use bamboo branches dipped in rosin to replace oil lamps. Pedestrians use bamboo poles instead of flashlights. Matches are sold for 20 copper coins per box. Various shops and families have also reverted to ancient methods, using incense, stones, steel plates, and incense sticks to replace matches, or often keeping a fire burning in a small stove. Because the prices of essential goods have risen so high, a revivalist scene can be seen everywhere in the villages. Therefore, all kinds of outdated locally-made industrial products are flourishing in response to the situation. The bamboo paper of western Fujian, originally a major export commodity, is now used as a material for small newspapers. Pine soot mixed with tea oil is used as printing ink. Hemp skin is woven into military straw sandals, which are the only items used for comforting the troops in Meixian. Women in the villages make and sell straw sandals. Brick and tile kilns in Xingning Huangpi and Pingyuan Shizheng have now been transformed into household porcelain factories. Tung oil is applied to cloth to make raincoats, oilcloth, oil paper, oil tanks, and oil baskets, which are being produced in large quantities to replace white iron cans.

<h3>Fierce Battles on the Sujia Road, Chinese Troops Capture Wangjiangjing</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence - The Chinese 62nd Division bravely attacked Wangjiangjing, the first station on the Sujia Road, the day before yesterday under torrential rain. The Japanese garrison there, after receiving the news, immediately mobilized. The two sides engaged in fierce battles at Jiejian Port, six li away from Wangjiangjing. At the same time, Wang Bomei, the leader of the People's Resistance Team, personally led more than 30 members of the assault team to outflank the small path. Taking advantage of the Japanese army's emptiness, they recovered Wangjiangjing. The Japanese army at Jiejian Port, hearing the alarm, collapsed and retreated, suffering many casualties. The next day, they advanced along the railway to Pingwang, and the vanguard had reached the south fence of Pingwang. Yesterday, travelers from the west arrived in Shanghai and heard that Japanese planes were dropping bombs in the Pingwang area, continuously from morning to night. It can be seen that the war there is in intense fighting on both sides. The cars of the Japanese Daizhi Automobile Company have stopped running due to repeated attacks en route. Because most of the Japanese troops in Jiaxing have been transferred to support the fierce battles in various places, although they urgently requested assistance, not a single soldier has arrived so far. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Jiaxing are very panicked.</p>
<h3>Property of German Nationals in Hong Kong Managed by the Dutch Consul-General</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Newsletter - After the outbreak of the European War, the Hong Kong government immediately adopted wartime measures and implemented the confiscation of enemy property. The proceeds are temporarily handed over to Mr. Anderle, the government receiver, for safekeeping, pending discussion and disposal after the armistice in the future. As for the number of German nationals' properties temporarily confiscated by the Hong Kong government, it is currently impossible to calculate clearly, and the clearing procedures have not yet been fully completed. The Hong Kong government will not confiscate the personal properties of German nationals, but will hand them over to Mr. Midderburgh, the Dutch Consul-General in Hong Kong, the agent for German affairs, for management. Those that have been cleared by the Hong Kong government will also be returned to the Dutch Consul-General for management.</p>
<h3>Ferry Enters Hong Kong, Accidentally Triggers a Mine Explosion, Forty-One People Tragically Drowned</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence - A Kwong-Hung ferry, towing two boats, accidentally triggered a mine outside Kap Shui Mun, causing it to explode on the spot. The ferry and towed boats were shattered at the same time, drowning 41 people and rescuing only 13. One night, when the Kwong-Hung ferry, towing two boats, was about to enter the Kap Shui Mun blockade line, a Hong Kong police vessel issued a warning, telling it to head south to avoid accidentally triggering a mine. The Kwong-Hung ferry immediately headed south, at about 9 p.m. But, after the Kwong-Hung ferry headed south for two hours, the helmsman saw a red buoy on the sea and, after passing the buoy, thought that the dangerous area had been crossed. So, he headed north again, because the Kwong-Hung ferry could not reach Hong Kong harbor unless it headed north. Unexpectedly, it triggered a mine not long after sailing, causing a catastrophe. This was truly unexpected. If the helmsman had listened to the warning of the police vessel from beginning to end, this would not have happened. The above news was obtained from a survivor. It is now heard that the Hong Kong government is paying close attention to this matter and intends to station vessels permanently outside the Kap Shui Mun and Lei Yue Mun blockade lines to indicate safe routes to ships entering the harbor, so as to avoid the unfortunate Kwong-Hung incident from happening again. In addition, the Kap Shui Mun and Lei Yue Mun harbor entrances have been blockaded for a long time. The Kwong-Hung ferry was the first incident. The naval authorities immediately dispatched personnel to inspect the mines that evening after the incident. The exploded mine position was replaced with a new mine.</p>

<h3>The Xikang Scientific Expedition Team Completes the Inspection</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Newsletter) The Xikang Scientific Expedition Team of the China Natural Science Society returned to Chongqing yesterday (October 27). It is reported that the results of this inspection were very good. The person in charge of the team said that this inspection focused on Jiulong County in southern Kang. Jiulong is high in altitude and cold, and it is very difficult to cultivate farmland. The only abundant resources are forests and medicinal materials, but transportation is very difficult due to inconvenient transportation. In other areas, the distribution of forests is more prosperous in northwestern Kang than in southeastern Kang. Therefore, if Xikang is to be developed, transportation construction must be expedited. In addition, there is a special phenomenon in Kang's climate, which was previously suspected and unresolved by predecessors, but the conclusion has now been reached, that is, the source of rainwater vapor in Kang Province is still drawn from the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean, and the main driving force for rainfall comes from the polar wind cold air in the north.</p>

<h3>Basketball Last Night, Hua Lian Wins Over Pujiang, 55 to 42</h3>
<p>At 7 pm last night, Hua Lian and Pujiang played a friendly basketball game at the China Youth Association. 400 people entered by purchasing tickets. There is a lack of talent in this year's Paramount Ning Shao. After Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun left Shanghai, the reporter knew that Chen Xuechong would rely on Hua Lian. As expected, he assisted last night, but because of the lack of contact, it was not as exciting as the previous games. Li Yunzhong and Shen Yugong were quite good. Pujiang's Lu Gusui and Fan Qingxian performed very well, posing a considerable threat to Hua Lian. Therefore, although Hua Lian won with 55 to 42, it was not without many difficulties. Because the competition was fierce, the audience's booing in the middle was considerably responsible. The score was 26 to 14 in the first half. The closest score in the second half was 24 to 28, with only four points apart. Hua Lian's ideal lineup is Shen Yugong, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Bao Songyuan, and Ren Xiangcheng.</p>

<h3>Finance, Negative News Buried, Gold Market Turns Up and Jumps Wildly, Off-Exchange High Reaches 3,700 Yuan Outside the Pass, Trading Volume in Half a Day is About 1,500 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was in good shape. The exchange rate continued to tighten sharply, and the negative news had completely disappeared. The bulls were delighted, and some were adding to their positions. There were quite a few retail investors entering the market. Although the Tianjin gang and others were selling at high prices, the market price still rose slightly. As a result, it rose by a huge 180 yuan compared to the previous day, which was the only rise seen in nearly two months. People's hearts in all quarters are unanimously upward. The reasons for the rise are (1) it is reported that the Customs will prohibit the import and export of Chinese legal tender, and has notified the consular offices of various countries, and the puppet regime has intentions, (2) Japanese Ambassador Kato came to Shanghai to discuss the Chinese situation with the US Consul, and the UK and Japan may reach a compromise, (3) the European war has a peaceful atmosphere, etc., which caused the morning to open with a tight exchange rate, and the gold number first pulled up, and then jumped 110 yuan, to 3,600 yuan, and then rose 10 yuan. However, a certain money exchange industry suddenly rose to the selling style. At that time, the exchange rate also slightly rebounded, and it fell to a low of 3,555 yuan. But before long, the exchange market suddenly tightened again. The securities gangs and a certain bank (on behalf of foreign merchants) took the opportunity to buy low, and the gold firms and other bulls added to their positions. For a time, it rose to 3,650 yuan. Soon, the exchange rate loosened again, and the Tianjin gang sold some, which put pressure down to 3,590 yuan. However, extending to the result, the exchange market finally announced a tight price, and the buying style became more intense, and it rose to a high price of 3,670 yuan to close. In the afternoon, the market was closed for half a day due to the autumn racing season, and the off-exchange continued to rise. It was heard that it once again rushed out of the 3,700 yuan barrier, reaching 3,705 yuan. The final price was about 3,700 yuan. Trading was still strong for half a day, about 1,500 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops rose by 20 yuan. The price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>The spot price rose by 180 yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) was quite sharp due to the tight exchange rate. A certain gold number first came to raise the price sharply. The opening market jumped 110 yuan, and the silver shop gang entered 20 taels from the money exchange industry, for 3,600 yuan. Then it rose 10 yuan, and the silver shop gang made 30 taels between each other, for 3,610 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the exchange rate slightly rebounded, and a certain money exchange industry tried to sell more than 200 taels. Although a certain bank frequently absorbed it on behalf of foreign merchants, the gold numbers and others also intended to supply it. Therefore, it fell back 55 yuan, and the money exchange industry sold 30 taels to the gold number, for 3,555 yuan. Then, because the exchange rate suddenly tightened sharply again, a certain bank's buying intentions became more intense, and a certain gold number and a certain money exchange industry competed to buy it, rising 95 yuan, and a certain gold number entered 50 taels from the same industry, for 3,650 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang and others sold more than 100 taels, and it once fell back slightly to 3,630 yuan. However, the securities gang came to buy it again soon, so it rose 20 yuan again, and the securities gang entered 20 taels from the silver shop gang, for 3,650 yuan. In addition, when the exchange rate rebounded, a certain broker took the opportunity to sell on behalf of the Tianjin gang, and many retail bulls also divested, so it fell back 60 yuan. The cash number sold 20 taels to the securities gang, for 3,590 yuan. Near noon, the exchange rate repeated tightening, and the silver shop gang also came to absorb it, which rose more than 20 yuan. Later, because a certain money exchange industry and a certain gold number started buying again, it rose sharply again by dozens of yuan, and the gold number entered 20 taels from the money exchange industry, for 3,670 yuan as the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to the autumn racing season. As a result, it rose 180 yuan from the noon closing price, with a fluctuation of 115 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the cash number's own gold brand was 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the price of buying back had to be reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current bid price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, but there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry rose frequently by 20 yuan</p>
<p>At first, the price of gold jewelry sold by silver shops was still 355 yuan per tael. Then, at 9:35, it rose by 10 yuan, at 10:20, it continued to rise by 5 yuan, and at 2:10 in the afternoon, it rose by another 5 yuan. As a result, it rose a total of 20 yuan, and the Da Tonghang changed the price to 375 yuan. The price of Xin Tonghang was the same as the above price, and the price of buying back was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency's Sharp Rise: British and American Gold Pounds Increase by Five and a Half Yuan, American Dollar Notes Also Rise by One Yuan and One Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies rose sharply due to the customs authorities' impending ban on the entry and exit of legal tender, creating a tense atmosphere. Wealthy individuals were alarmed and uneasy. Additionally, foreign exchange contracted, causing prices to soar. British and American gold pounds were in high demand, and market prices rose sharply. There was strong absorption of British and American gold notes, with American dollar notes rising to 11.85 yuan in the morning. Although there was no foreign exchange market on Wednesday afternoon, the demand for American dollar notes remained high, continuing to trend firmly upward. The evening closing price was 12.25 yuan. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes were also in high demand. Singapore, Dutch, and Annamese notes all rose dramatically. Canadian and Philippine notes rose sharply along with the American dollar notes. Demand for Japanese gold notes was also high, with the evening market price at 1.13 yuan. Supply of Korean notes was scarce, with the evening market price at 1.1005 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds both rise by 5.50 yuan, British gold notes rise by 3.80 yuan, American dollar notes rise by 1.10 yuan, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.19 yuan, French franc notes rise by 0.03 yuan, Singapore notes rise by 0.40 yuan, Dutch notes rise by 0.50 yuan, Annamese notes rise by 0.30 yuan, Robbie notes rise by 0.10 yuan, Canadian notes rise by 0.60 yuan, and Philippine notes rise by 0.25 yuan. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate on Foreign Exchange Rises Sharply by Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate on foreign exchange drafts and bills rose sharply due to the acute tightness of foreign exchange, the rise in cash prices, and the widening channels for the demand of legal tender. The discount rate per thousand yuan suddenly rose to 36 yuan, even reaching as high as 42 yuan. It slightly receded at noon to 38 yuan, but then rose again in the afternoon, ultimately reaching 42 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 15% in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Sudden Tightening in the Foreign Exchange Market: Chinese Merchants Rush to Cover Short Positions, British Gold Nears Five Pence</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC quoted prices. However, the unofficial market for British and American exchange suddenly experienced a sharp contraction, almost reaching the critical level of five pence. From Monday to today, within just three days, the fluctuation amounted to a massive one pence. The reasons for this were inquired as follows: (1) It was rumored that the customs authorities, under certain influences, had implemented strict restrictions on the entry and exit of legal tender. (2) It was widely speculated that a glimmer of peace was emerging in the European war situation. (3) It was heard that the Hong Kong banks, which had been selling off repeatedly, suddenly leaned towards absorption, causing the speculative buying to intensify once again. The initial opening was stable, but subsequently, Chinese merchants painfully rushed to cover their short positions. Furthermore, the Hong Kong-based Sassoon and other firms aggressively drove up prices, causing a temporary retreat to 5.0625 pence for British gold and 8.25 yuan for American exchange. Because HSBC was willing to supply at the quoted price of five pence, the speculative buying subsided slightly. In addition, foreign banks such as Banque Belge pour l'Etranger took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing an immediate rebound to 5.21875 pence and 8.5625 yuan. By noon, due to Hong Kong-based firms resuming their purchases and Japanese banks also engaging in speculative buying, the prices contracted again to 5.09375 pence and 8.3125 yuan at the closing. As a result, British exchange tightened by 0.0375, and American exchange softened by 0.0625. The trend of futures followed the same path as spot prices, with both spot and futures trading brisk throughout the half-day session.</p>
<p>Sassoon and Hong Kong Firms Also Purchase</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to large London transactions, the near-term futures rose by 0.0375, and the far-term rose by half a pence. The New York silver price and various foreign exchange rates for the United States were closed for one day due to the election day. The London spot gold price remained unchanged, and the exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The Central Bank's quoted prices for various currencies remained the same as before. The banks opened with spot selling prices of 5.46875 pence for British gold and 8.9375 yuan for American exchange, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After the opening, speculative buying started to emerge, and soon Hong Kong-based firms such as Jardine Matheson and Sassoon also began buying. In addition, Chinese merchants and cotton yarn firms, seeing the unfavorable situation, also rushed to cover their short positions. Furthermore, because the willingness of foreign banks to supply was not strong, the market surged sharply. It was estimated that the speculative buying by foreign banks increased the spot British gold price from 5.4375 to 5.25 pence and the spot American exchange price from 8.875 to 8.3125 yuan. At the same time, Chinese merchants also bought British gold futures for the current month from Standard Chartered and other banks, pushing the price from 5.40625 to 5.28125 pence, and American exchange futures for the current month from 8.75 to 8.50 yuan. The HSBC quoted prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced at 0.0225. Subsequently, some banks started to sell, and exporters also supplied, causing the situation to rebound to 5.3125 pence and 8.625 yuan. However, as sellers gradually decreased, speculative buying intensified again, causing the trend to become tight and soft again. It was estimated that Sassoon and Hong Kong-based firms purchased spot British gold from foreign banks for 5.25 to 5.0625 pence and spot American exchange from 8.50 to 8.25 yuan. At the same time, it was heard that Chinese merchants were still covering their short positions. Later, it was rumored that HSBC was willing to supply at the quoted price, so the speculative buying subsided temporarily. In addition, certain banks and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the trend to rebound again to 5.21875 pence and 8.5625 yuan. At noon, due to renewed buying and the Japanese banks also engaging in speculative buying, the situation reversed again, softening the market. By the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 5.09375 pence for British gold and 8.3125 yuan for American exchange, and the current month's futures prices were 5.078125 pence for British gold and 8.28125 yuan for American exchange. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British exchange tightened sharply by 0.0375, and the American exchange contracted sharply by 0.0625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rates Rise Sharply</p>

<h3>British and Indian Silver Firm</h3>
<p>London, 7th - Silver market speculators purchased, and Indian acquisitions of far-term silver with reduced supply created a flat market, with calm conditions after closing. Large silver bars rose by 0.0375 in the near-term and 0.005 pence in the far-term. The New York silver price was closed due to the election day. A Bombay silver telegram stated that the Indian silver market was stable, with spot and December each rising by 5 annas, and January rising by 6 annas. Only ten transactions were completed.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Wither, Foreign Bonds Thrive, Foreign Stocks Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The securities unofficial market continued to weaken yesterday, with increasingly fragile conditions and dampened sentiment, reversing the previously enthusiastic state. The current short sellers are those who were previously long, and while the problem is addressed by the same individuals, their concepts are absolutely opposite. A large number of superficial and insubstantial individuals are still looking for opportunities to sell, so the trend consistently struggles to rise. Class C bonds even broke through the 7 yuan barrier. Given the current environment and sentiment, it is temporarily impossible to revive the market. In the morning, Sheng, Da, Tiansheng, Tongkang, and other firms successively sold off. In the middle, the 20th, Datong, Yuankang, and other firms briefly bought in, slightly raising prices, but the continuous outflow of actual goods made it difficult to reverse the declining trend. In the afternoon, even those who had been optimistic could not hold on, and banks sold off. Class C bonds suddenly broke through the 7 yuan barrier, further deteriorating the situation. Hongda, Lianhe, and other firms also divested, while Xieda, Tiansheng, and Hengfu slightly covered their short positions, but it was a drop in the bucket. Currently, the excess of long positions is clearly surrounded by short sellers. As a result, market prices continued to decline by 0.075 to 0.125 yuan. The total volume of transactions was over one million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 30 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 50.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of the General Chamber of Commerce was extremely soft at the opening due to the tightening of foreign exchange and rumors that certain parties had announced a customs ban on the import and export of legal tender, fearing a tightening of credit. However, the stocks being sold off were quickly absorbed at low prices. The closing market conditions improved slightly. The most actively traded stocks were International Trust Company, Ruirong, Steel Industry, China Reclamation, and Telephone. Rubber stocks trended firmer due to rising London spot prices.</p>
<p>London, 7th - Today, the quoted prices of British companies in the Far East continued to rise. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £8 15s, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (London registered) shares rose by £2 to £85.5, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (Hong Kong registered) shares rose by £0.5 to £85, Kaiping Coal Mines shares rose by 6 pence to 19 shillings, and Gula-Klang Rubber shares rose by 1 shilling and 9 pence to 20 shillings even. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 7th - Today, the quoted prices of Chinese foreign bonds rose again. The high-end British and French bonds rose sharply by £5 to £50, the Reorganization Loan (British issue) rose by £3 to £42, the British and German bonds and the Sino-French bonds each rose by £2, the former to £57 and the latter to £52, and the Crisp Loan rose by £1 to £28. Among the lower-end railway bonds, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway bonds rose sharply by £4 to £20, the Hukuang Railway bonds and the Canton-Kowloon Railway bonds each rose by £2, with the non-German issue Hukuang Railway bonds and the Canton-Kowloon Railway bonds both at £17, the German issue Hukuang Railway bonds at £16, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds each rising by £1 to £14. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Buying Sentiment Turns Strong, Yarn Market Recovers, Fellow Traders Transact Over a Thousand Bales, Shuang Ma Factory Opens 5,000 Bales</h3>
<p>The long-depressed yarn market showed signs of recovery due to the reduction in foreign exchange. At the same time, prices have fallen significantly from their peak, and fellow traders have suffered significant losses, which may provide temporary relief. However, actual demand has not yet developed, although fellow traders' sentiment is excited, and buying is quite strong. Transactions, which have been dull for a long time, have suddenly become lively. However, the factory took the opportunity to open up a large quantity, with 5,000 bales of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn at a price of 650 yuan, with the November-December term, and a deposit of 60 yuan per bale. Most of them are accepted by traders.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn showed hopeful sentiment, and asking prices increased. The opening price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was 626 yuan. Shortly after hearing that exchange rates had decreased, the atmosphere suddenly became strong. Although there were few inquiries from customers, speculators emerged, and the market price rose steadily to 640 yuan. Subsequently, after hearing that the factory was opening up in large quantities, prices fell by 2 yuan. It was found that 1,225 bales were traded in half a day, with a rise of 14 yuan for Tian Nu yarn, 12.5 yuan for Shuang Diqiu yarn, and 10 yuan for the factory. The Shenxin factory opened up 100 bales of 10-count red Shuang Ma yarn at a price of 490 yuan, and the 9th factory opened up 20-count Shuang Ma yarn under the same conditions as above. Today, 217 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn bought by each port is listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 1,055 Hong Kong: 120</p>
<p>Shantou: 20 Xiamen: 20</p>
<p>Ningbo: 10 Total: 1,223</p>
<h3>Tong Cotton Follows the Rise by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions are still being maintained. The selling price of Tongzhou cotton has risen by more than 2 yuan. Due to the increase in yarn prices and the sharp decrease in foreign exchange rates, sentiment has been boosted and market conditions have improved. However, factories have recently purchased a large amount of American cotton overseas, amounting to tens of thousands of bales, so their sentiment is relatively stable. However, the sharp rise in Indian cotton in the past two days has caused some nervous individuals to discuss being optimistic. The future outcome depends heavily on the foreign exchange rate. There were 1,018 bales of Supu cotton arriving from northern Jiangsu, 580 bales from Changyinsha, and 980 bales from Beisha. The current cotton conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton: 132.00 Fellow Traders: 200 bales</p>
<p>Also: 131.50 Also: 200 bales</p>
<p>Also: 133.50 Also: 400 bales</p>
<p>In other news, spot cotton transactions in Shanghai became quiet yesterday due to the sudden tightening of exchange rates. Factories have already processed a considerable amount of cotton in the past few days. Fellow traders continue to be very interested in purchasing raw cotton, but due to the rapid tightening of exchange rates, there is no opportunity to take advantage of the situation, so they can only stand by and watch. The public anticipates that American cotton transactions will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday due to the American election day, and all transactions were suspended. However, a major cotton firm in this port received a telegram from its head office stating that the American government had issued a statement on the issue of cotton loans for the future. As a result, American cotton rose by more than 20 pounds, and India, due to the rumors of American cotton loans, quickly predicted a sharp rise of 12.5 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 pounds, and Liverpool cotton rose by 24 pence.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Arrives in Droves, Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The rising trend of rice prices has been suppressed because goods from various regions are arriving in large numbers, with continuous shipments. 24 to 25 carts of goods from Sujia, Taikun, Qingsi, Fenglian, and other regions, as well as 1,300 to 1,400 bags of goods from Baimaokou transferred to Changbang, have arrived. Furthermore, rumors are spreading in the market that a large batch of Jingwu and other top-grade rice will arrive in the port soon, causing sentiment to weaken and customers to refrain from purchasing further. As a result, the market has stabilized. The closing price for top-grade Jiangbei rice was 23.20 yuan, the price for Zhongshi goods was 22.90 yuan, the price for top-grade Jingwu was 23.20 yuan, and the price for second-grade was 22 yuan. The arrival of new japonica rice is also strong. Shops are taking a wait-and-see approach, and sales are sluggish. However, the closing price is close to the top-grade market, so it is unwilling to depreciate further, resulting in no gains or losses. Only Luyang top-grade goods are scarce and continue to be good for 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Luyi kiln seeds vary from 0.40 to 0.50 yuan. There are no white goji goods available and no market. Early Nanhang rice is opening at 26 yuan, and with the change of yuan, goods are scarce, and distilleries and rice vendors can still sell, so the situation is quite firm. Statistics show that only 3,000 to 4,000 bags were traded in the entire city.</p>
<p>Another report states that after the opening market for passenger upland rice yesterday morning, the demand from passenger-making rural shops was not diminishing, and the market warehouses insisted on increasing prices. Under the clandestine and overt price increases from various parties, prices rose all the way, rising more than 0.50 yuan compared to the previous day. However, after the price increase, some importers were reluctant to watch, and profitable warehouses and Japanese firms sold off. Furthermore, the combined Shanghai cost of Jiangbei rice is only within 21 yuan. Today, with the consecutive soaring prices, it is now possible to transport. It is also rumored that market members and firms from Jiangbei each have a batch of goods ready for shipment, which can arrive at the port within days. The market heard this news, and selling sentiment was strong, causing the market to fall back by about 0.50 yuan. Only about 3,000 bags were formally traded.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Refined Soybean Oil Monopolized, Selling Price Rises Again by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the monopoly on drummed oil from Kobe and Dalian, the Dalian oil market rose by another yuan yesterday, with 130 drums traded. The market price opened at 69.50 yuan. However, the rising trend of barrel oil slightly subsided. As a result, the market rose slightly by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan compared to the previous day. 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened at a price of 48.60 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai oil at 50.80 yuan, and 100 pieces of Qingdao oil at 49.70 yuan. 30 drums of Qingdao drummed oil were delivered within two weeks, with 100 dan of this factory's oil at a price of 53.80 yuan. The trend of peanut oil remained flat, continuing to be transported from Hong Kong. An estimated 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were processed, as well as 500 dan of Jiangbei listening oil and 2,000 dan of Yantai listening oil.</p>
<p>1,800 cans of soybean oil and 200 cans of sesame oil, as well as 150 bags of soybeans, will be transported to Hong Kong on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined Sugar Revives</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Dutch telegram, the price of raw white sugar was 7.1 Dutch guilders, an increase of 0.20. The reduction in the Dutch exchange rate requires a price increase of more than 2.70 yuan. Therefore, the long-depressed market has shown a rebound. The Guild's divided market saw spot prices of 24-grade raw white sugar rise by 3 yuan, with foreign warehouses at 52.50 to 2.30 yuan. Taikoo grade A also rose by 2.50 to 2.30 yuan, while the B grade was at 56 to 55.7 yuan. Other grades such as CW are also being phased out. Because the raw materials for local refined white sugar and grade 1 crystal sugar have already increased, they have also increased accordingly. The domestic sugar market is very soft. Only Guangbang opened 106 bales of Dongxiang red sugar, the color of which was still good, but the quality was very soft, and it was only traded at 32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise, Selling Prices in This City Vary</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price in Yokohama rose by 20 yuan, the far-term price rose by 19 yuan, the near-term price in New York rose by 5 cents, and the far-term price rose by 5 cents. The spot price of Japanese silk rose by 2 to 3 cents, while the price of Chinese silk remained unchanged. The silk market in this port has not seen any increases or decreases due to the lack of imports and exports. The selling price of July-August white factory silk ranged from 3,850 to 3,900 yuan, and the selling prices were not very consistent, depending on the strength and fatigue of the price holdings of the manufacturers or hoarders. Yesterday, Da Chang made 20 bundles of white factory silk, and the Qianjin silk rough reeling was purchased by Samsung and other firms for 30 dan, with no gains or losses.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Fabric Production Overcapacity, Inventory Has a Tendency to Increase</h3>
<p>The fabric market is not active, and fellow traders and hoarders tend to sell. Although the factories have reduced and suspended production as a countermeasure because the current market price has fallen within the cost, the reduced production volume still exceeds actual sales, so the inventory has a tendency to continue to increase. Yesterday, foreign exchange rates tightened, and the yarn market suddenly rose, but various fabrics were unable to rise due to sluggish actual sales. Selling prices were generally stable, with actual sales of flat matting. The Zhejiang Dongyongtai Ouzhou firms added more than 100 pieces of Yihua light and heavy coarse fabric, colored fabric, colored twill, and fine twill. The Min Xinghua Quanzhou firms added nearly 100 pieces of colored twill, cashmire, coarse fabric, and fine fabric. The Guangdong firms added 70 to 80 pieces of Fugui, Dapeng, fine fabric light and heavy coarse fabric. Yihua and Zhenzhong and other factories in this street traded more than 200 pieces of coarse fabric, fine fabric, fine twill, bleached dyed printed fabric, and various fabrics.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the recovery of the yarn market, the selling prices of white fine fabric and fine twill were slightly firmer, with each piece rising by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. The spot price of 12-pound Longtou fine fabric was 18.30 yuan. The Dong cotton firm opened up futures for the current month at 18.45 yuan, and the Ito firm opened up futures for the next month at only 18.60 yuan. Each firm ordered about 200 to 300 pieces. Fellow traders in this street were slightly more stable, and 400 to 500 pieces of fine fabric and fine twill from various brands were traded, but customer firms' interest was still low. The Tianjin firms only handled dozens of pieces of fine fabric.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branch Stores Prices All Rise</h3>
<p>Due to the procurement by the Ouzhou firms, the prices of orchid bamboo branches suddenly rose. More than hundreds of boxes of market goods were opened yesterday, rising by 5 yuan compared to before. The market firms must add sorting, increasing costs, so the selling prices must rise by 10 yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3>Obstructing the Circulation of Legal Tender: The False Regime's Conspiracy Will Not Succeed. The Commissioner of Customs Has Never Issued a Prohibition Order. Ten Million Yuan Worth of Legal Tender, Shipped from America, Has Been Unloaded in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>Li Jiannan, the "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" appointed by the "Renovation Government," has requested various consuls in Shanghai and Luo, the Commissioner of Customs, to prohibit the import of Chinese legal tender, aiming to promote its "Huaxing Notes." The ten million yuan worth of legal tender brought by the American ship President Pierce was safely unloaded yesterday. The consuls and the Commissioner of Customs have indicated their non-acceptance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attempt to Prohibit the Import of Legal Tender</p>
<p>Since the fall of the area where the Shanghai Jianghai Customs is located, its tax revenue has been intercepted and paid to the Yokohama Specie Bank. Since being forced to change its flag and accepting "Huaxing Notes" from September 1, the tax collection personnel of the Central Bank have been forced to withdraw. Now, it has gone a step further. The "Superintendent" Li Jiannan has notified Luo, the Commissioner of Customs, and the consuls of various countries, attempting to prohibit the import of Chinese legal tender. It is reported that the consuls of various countries in Shanghai have decided to ignore this matter, and Luo, the Commissioner of Customs, has also indicated that he will not accept it.</p>
<p>Ten Million Yuan in Legal Tender Unloaded Yesterday</p>
<p>The President Pierce of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying ten million yuan of Chinese legal tender from Hong Kong. It is said that it belongs to the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank. Li Jiannan, the "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," even attempted to detain it. Reporters learned from banking circles yesterday that the ten million yuan in legal tender was unloaded as usual yesterday and was not detained by any party. However, it is difficult to predict whether there will be problems with the shipment of legal tender to Shanghai in the future. In addition, fifty million yuan of legal tender was imported last Tuesday, and no obstruction occurred.</p>
<p>Commissioner of Customs Has Not Issued a Prohibition Order</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of the import of legal tender, Commissioner of Customs Robert L. Forrest has never issued a prohibition order. Therefore, the import of legal tender will be permitted in accordance with the original method. The rumor that the ten million yuan worth of currency brought by the President Pierce the day before yesterday was detained by the Jianghai Customs has been denied by a certain Commissioner of Customs yesterday. At the same time, the Shanghai branches of the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank also denied that the Jianghai Customs detained the legal tender.</p>
<p>Sufficient Legal Tender in Shanghai</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Finance has made every effort to prevent the inflow of legal tender into the occupied areas to prevent the Japanese from purchasing and speculating in foreign exchange, it still instructs the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to transport as much legal tender to Shanghai as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries in the Shanghai concession area. Although Li Jiannan, the "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," has attempted to prevent the transport to Shanghai, the legal tender in Shanghai is very sufficient and enough for circulation in the concession area. At the same time, subsidiary currency notes and fractional currency notes that have already circulated in the concession area are also quite numerous, so there will definitely be no shortage in the future.</p>
<p>The False Regime's Dream Will Eventually Be Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>A reporter also interviewed a financial magnate in this port. According to him, the false regime is attempting to obstruct the import of legal tender on the one hand and purchasing it in large quantities on the other, reducing the legal tender circulating in the market in this port, so that the "Huaxing" counterfeit currency can take the opportunity to invade the market. However, the legal tender circulating in this port is very large, and fifty million yuan of newly printed legal tender was transported in the past two weeks. Combined with those already circulating in the market, the amount is astonishing. It is absolutely impossible for the false regime to absorb it all. If it lasts for a long time, the situation will change rapidly. This plan of the false regime will eventually be shattered and will only see its efforts fail. Moreover, Shanghai is an international city, and the commercial interests of third countries in Shanghai are very large. It is difficult to allow this unprepared counterfeit currency to be used as currency. If the false regime stubbornly persists, the resentment of third countries will deepen day by day.</p>
<p>No Changes in the Foreign Exchange Market</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that after the Nanjing "Renovation Government" announced the prohibition of the import of legal tender into Shanghai, the financial and business circles in Shanghai were greatly puzzled last night (the 7th). As of late last night, there were no signs of what trend the foreign exchange market would take due to this new restriction. According to some Chinese sources, since the import of banknotes is restricted, the silver and money market in this port will eventually be tightened, and there will be greater demand for legal tender. They do not believe</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market</p>
<p>There will be any major changes at present, but there will be changes when banknotes are increasingly scarce in the future. However, there is no greater danger of a shortage of banknotes at this time. It is estimated that in the past two weeks, new legal tender worth nearly 50 million yuan has been transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai. This number, plus the banknotes already transported to Shanghai, is quite large in total. Chinese and foreign banks and financial circles all believe that this move by the "Renovation Government" is</p>
<p>Japanese Puppet Side</p>
<p>An action to force the use of Huaxing currency in the Shanghai area. The plan contains the Japanese side purchasing legal tender through normal foreign exchange channels, until the legal tender withdraws from the market, so that Huaxing currency can be forced to be used. However, it is expected that this procedure will take a very long time and that any events can occur to change the situation. The financial sector also emphasized that unless something completely unpredictable happens at this moment, there is no reason to be shocked. It was found that the "Renovation Government" was</p>
<p>Announced Prohibition</p>
<p>Before the import of legal tender, customs officials sent by it tried to detain about 10 million yuan of legal tender transported by the President Pierce from Hong Kong yesterday, but failed. It is heard that these legal tender were transported by the Hong Kong branch of a certain foreign bank in this city. Because the matter is complicated, Li Jianfu, the "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" sent by the "Renovation Government," allowed these legal tender to enter Shanghai, and then notified the leading consuls, saying that this was the last batch allowed to enter Shanghai.</p>
<p>Leading Consuls</p>
<p>After receiving the notification, they forwarded it to the consulates general in this city. Also, the Shanghai Times reported that the Jianghai Customs authorities yesterday implemented the "Meiguan New Notice" signed by Li Jiannan for the first time, and detained millions of legal tender transported from Hong Kong by the President Pierce to the Chase Bank in this city. After protests from the bank and other authorities, and after a long consultation, these legal tender were imported through customs and delivered to</p>
<p>Chase Bank</p>
<p>However, it is heard that the "Customs Authorities" have stated that they will strictly abide by the order prohibiting the import and export of legal tender in the future. The customs' detention of legal tender yesterday was quite surprising, because although the "Renovation Government" has a superintendent in the customs in this city, it has not yet prohibited the import and export of legal tender. But Li Jiannan notified the consulates of various countries in this city yesterday morning that the "Renovation Government" has issued an order prohibiting the import and export of legal tender without a special license. Although this notice was</p>
<p>Issued Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>But its date is written as November 4. The customs may have detained the banknotes delivered to Chase Bank yesterday for this reason. Although the full text of the customs notice has not been announced, it is heard that the notice stipulates that those who secretly transport legal tender will be detained, and in special circumstances, permits will be issued through proper channels.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Release of Portuguese Ships: the Shipping Company Was Not Contacted for the Forged "Registration." The Truth Was Only Learned After Inquiring at the Portuguese Consulate.</h3>
<p>Regarding the Portuguese merchants' ships that were detained, although they have recently been released by the Japanese Navy one after another, the reason for their release is not the result of negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate, but contains special background and is subject to conditions. Therefore, the shipping companies have not contacted them beforehand. All the ships have been released and are still moored on the Huangpu River, unable to sail. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The ships Fulu, Libao, etc. are still being detained. The details are as follows, as explored by the Dagang News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>The Truth About the Release of Ships by the Japanese</p>
<p>Last month, the Dade and Lude ships of the Portuguese merchant Zhengde Company, which had been out of service for a long time and suffered losses, first succumbed and admitted to registering with the "False Bureau," so they were released one after another. At the same time, the Hailong and gasoline flatboats Fadebao and Dede of the Atlantic Company were also released in the same way. As for the three ships Tanglu, Tangqiao, and Tangbei, which were returned by the Japanese on the 4th of this month, it is learned that someone was used to pretend to be the shipowner and allowed registration, so they were also released. However, the American shipping company Huamei Navigation Company, the agent of the three ships, knew nothing about it beforehand. After inquiring at the Portuguese Consulate, they learned the truth and are preparing to negotiate. In addition, the above-mentioned released ships are still berthed between buoys 20 and 31 of Yangshupu yesterday. Because the flag issue and other minor issues have not been resolved, it will be difficult to sail in the short term.</p>
<p>Libao, Fulu, and Meida Were Not Released</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the seven Portuguese ships Fulu, Fade, Meida, Libao, Feihe, Lude, and Baode had been returned by the Japanese. According to the Dagang News Agency reporter's investigation of the shipping industry, it is confirmed that among the seven ships, Fade, Lude, and Baode were indeed returned for the aforementioned reasons. As for Fulu and Libao (both belonging to Zhengde Shipping Company) and Meida (belonging to the Meili Company), as well as the Deyao ship that was recently detained, because the company authorities have always been firm and unwilling to succumb, they have not been released. All the ships are still moored in their original places, and the Japanese naval flag is hung on the foremast. There are also four ships that have automatically suspended service, Shantai, Avimari, Suosai, and Meifa, which are also moored at No. 31 on the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador to Go to Chongqing Today</h3>
<p>According to Havas News Agency in this port, the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, is scheduled to go to Hanoi, Vietnam on the 9th of this month to discuss various issues related to China and Vietnam with General Catroux, the Governor of Vietnam, and then go to Chongqing to stay for several months. In accordance with the spirit of mutual friendship between the Chinese and French governments, he will consult with the National Government authorities on various issues.</p>
<h3>Public Farewell to Baker. Shi Zhaoji and Others Gave Speeches Praising Baker's Work</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, Director-General of the China International Famine Relief Commission and the Shanghai International Red Cross, is returning to the United States for a vacation. Fifteen groups including the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, as well as friends of Baker, held a public farewell banquet at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fourth Road at 7:30 last night. More than 100 representatives from various groups, including American Commercial Counselor Arnold, American China Famine Relief Committee Shanghai Office Committee members Wheel and Jiant, Pastor Gao Ai of the American Church on Beidang Road, President Bu Fangji of St. John's University, He Dekui, Yuan Ludeng, Guan Jiongzhi, and Wen Lanting, were also invited to attend. During the banquet, Chairman Shi Zhaoji gave a speech first, followed by speeches by Arnold and Zhao Jinqing, all praising Baker's great achievements in the charity cause in Jiangsu. Finally, Dr. Baker gave a reply, expressing his gratitude, and learned that the Executive Committee of the China International Famine Relief Commission has decided to invite Baker to continue his post for four years, until December 31, 1943.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Last Night. Land and Water Transportation Was Obstructed. Low-Lying Roads Were Flooded.</p>
<p>The fog was quite heavy in this port from dawn yesterday morning. It was difficult to distinguish people beyond a few steps. All kinds of vehicles had to drive slowly. Water transportation was also obstructed. Ships outside the Wusongkou were delayed in entering the port. Therefore, before 9:00 a.m., there was not a word on the customs ship import and export sign. After 10:00 a.m., they began to enter the port one after another. As for the climate, it has been unusually hot and humid recently, as if it were summer. There was a sudden downpour in the afternoon, which subsided slightly by evening, but the rain became even heavier after nightfall, pouring down, and the low-lying roads were flooded like a swamp, and the weather was quite bad. Also, a new typhoon has risen in the Pacific Ocean, and this port can avoid being attacked.</p>
<p>Nine Japanese Sentry Posts North of the Suzhou Creek Were Quietly Withdrawn Yesterday. The Reason Is Unknown and Was Not Announced in Advance. The Number of Residents North of the Suzhou Creek Has Reached 400,000.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, nine Japanese Marine Corps sentry posts north of the Suzhou Creek were quietly withdrawn yesterday afternoon (the 7th). The Japanese side did not explain this and did not announce it in advance. Among them, four sentry posts along the Hongkou River were located at Xihua Road, Hanbili Road, Youheng Road, and Yalu Road. The obstacles and sentry houses have been removed. As for the sentry posts on Broadway Road and Jiaxing Road, they have not been removed, but one of the two sentry houses at the entrance of Broadway Road has been reduced. The remaining five sentry posts that have been withdrawn yesterday are located at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Lan Road (at the Fire Department), the intersection of Pingliang Road and Lan Road, the intersection of Taopeng Road and Huade Road, the intersection of Huade Road and Ningguo Road, and the intersection of Hejian Road and Gelan Road in Yangshupu. The obstacles have also been removed. It has been more than a year since these sentry posts were set up, which has caused traffic jams for vehicles and pedestrians. The number of residents in the areas north of the Suzhou Creek has reached about 400,000. Crowded trucks and pedestrians have been repeatedly intercepted by sentry posts. Now that most of the sentry posts have been removed, traffic can be accelerated. Also, it is reported that the Japanese side is continuing to erect military telephone lines at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road. One end of the line is installed on the side of the building at No. 490 Laobazi Road, and the line was extended to the front of the Jinmen Grand Theater yesterday morning.</p>
<p>All Circles in Shanghai Held a Meeting Yesterday to Establish the Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo. Eighty-Nine Committee Members Were Appointed. A Petition for National Funeral Was Submitted to Express Condolences.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Mr. Ma, initiated by the Danyang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, held a preparatory meeting at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 celebrities from all walks of life and representatives from various charities attended the meeting. Jiang Kesheng was the chairman. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The meeting was announced to be held at 3:00 p.m. After the audience stood in silence for three minutes, Chairman Jiang Kesheng gave a speech, saying that he was very grateful that all circles came in the midst of the cold wind and rain to attend the preparatory meeting for the memorial service. Although the memorial service for Mr. Ma was initiated by the Danyang Fellow Villagers Association, in terms of Mr. Ma's great career in his life, it was not a loss for one county, but a loss for one country. Therefore, all circles were able to enthusiastically participate automatically. Mr. Ma's past merits are needless to say. However, the most regrettable thing is that his diaries and a part of his writings, nearly 20 boxes, were packed and shipped to his hometown of Danyang during the war, in preparation for the library to preserve them, but they were all lost on the way. This major loss cannot be measured by money.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Various Items</p>
<p>(1) The name of the memorial service, during the preparation period, was unanimously resolved and passed to use the "Preparatory Committee for the Shanghai All Circles Memorial Service for Mr. Ma Xiangbo," (2) Participating in the memorial service is based on groups, but does not restrict individuals from joining, (3) Submit a petition to the National Government to issue a national funeral, (4) Publish Mr. Ma's life deeds and condolences, (5) Invite Mr. Zhang Chongren, a sculptor and great-grandson of Mr. Ma, to cast a bronze statue of Mr. Ma (Mr. Zhang expressed his acceptance on the spot) to commemorate him permanently. The above cases are all handed over to the preparatory committee for responsible handling, and 89 preparatory committee members were appointed on the spot, and it was decided to hold the first preparatory meeting on the 13th of this month, which will still be convened by the Danyang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Memorial Services in Various Schools</p>
<p>The Xuhui Middle School in Xujiahui is where Mr. Ma studied in his childhood and has been established for 90 years. Upon suddenly hearing of Mr. Ma's death, the teachers and students of the whole school were extremely sad and held a memorial service in the school's auditorium at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. It is heard that when Mr. Ma celebrated his 100th birthday in April this year, it coincided with the 90th anniversary of the school's founding. Mr. Ma specially wrote a vertical scroll as a gift to the school for commemoration. Mr. Ma regarded the school as his alma mater, so he usually took great care of it, and he was even more concerned about it during the war. It is heard that the school has treasured the vertical scroll given by Mr. Ma for lasting commemoration. Aurora University has scheduled a memorial service for Mr. Ma on the 15th and plans to invite Zhu Xianmei, the current Bishop of Haimen District, to come to Shanghai to preside over it. Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, the old man's nephew, has sent a special letter to invite him, and he will be able to come to Shanghai at that time. Liangshan will be presided over by Yu Bin. Mr. Ma was also the founder of Fudan University. After hearing the bad news, the teachers and students of Chongqing Fudan University wore school mourning clothes for three days to express their condolences. In addition to sending a telegram to Liangshan to express condolences, Fudan University in this city, together with its affiliated middle school, vocational school, and the school's board of directors, Fudan Alumni Association, and other groups, have jointly prepared to hold a memorial ceremony. It is heard that it has been decided to hold the "Teacher Ma Memorial Service" jointly at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on the 15th (next Wednesday), and the school flag will be hung at half-mast and classes will be suspended for one day on that day to express condolences. Condolence documents from all walks of life will be collected and forwarded by the Fudan Alumni Association in the Pudong Building.</p>
<h3>U.S. Marine Corps Celebrates Its Founding Anniversary. A Review Ceremony Will Be Held Tomorrow Morning. Military Officers from Various Countries Are Invited to Watch the Parade.</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the U.S. Marine Corps is the oldest established unit in the U.S. military. On the 10th of this month, it will be its 164th anniversary. The U.S. 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai has formulated a plan to celebrate its anniversary on a grand scale on the 10th. The important items include the 4th Marine Regiment parading at the racecourse polo field at 11:00 a.m., reviewed by Admiral Hart, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and awarding a new regimental flag. The parade will</p>
<p>Have a Special Feature</p>
<p>That is, a squad of Marine Corps guards will wear the uniforms of 1775. At that time, important guests will also attend the ceremony. After the parade, the 4th Marine Regiment Club will host a banquet to entertain the officers and soldiers of the team and the guests, who will have ample opportunity to recover from their fatigue after the celebration. It is said that the 4th Marine Regiment will be on vacation until the morning of Monday of next week. Check</p>
<p>U.S. Marine Corps</p>
<p>Traditionally, two battalions participate in the parade of the 4th Regiment, but there will be three battalions in the parade on Friday of this week. Each battalion has two companies, all equipped with rifles. The additional battalion will be composed of the regiment's machine gun squad, but will also carry rifles without towing machine gun carts during the parade. Senior army and navy officers from the UK, France, Italy, Japan, and the US Consul General in Shanghai have been invited to watch the parade.</p>
<h3>Kagematsu Kato Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon. It Is Reported That He Will Exchange Views with the U.S. Consul.</h3>
<p>Kagematsu Kato, the Japanese special envoy to China, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Nagasaki Maru at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th. It is learned that Kato arrived in Shanghai at 12:00 p.m. yesterday. The ship docked at the Huishan Wharf. Kato's mission is to consult with the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, and other diplomats from third countries to exchange general views on the current situation in China, and to conduct complementary negotiations with Tokyo.</p>
<h3>The False Regime Will Counter-Propose Suggestions on the Roads Outside the Concession. The Suggestions to the Municipal Council Will Be Answered in a Few Days.</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, it was heard from reliable sources this morning (the 8th) that "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an will probably reply to the Municipal Council's proposal to solve the problem of roads outside the concession within the next few days. It is also heard that in the reply, several counter-proposals will be made.</p>
<h3>Bassett Returned to Shanghai and Talked about Recent Public Opinion in the United States. The Amendment to the Neutrality Act Is of Concern to the Whole Country. Most People Sympathize with the Allied Powers.</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, Bassett, a director of the British American Tobacco Company, returned to Shanghai last Friday (the 5th) after a four-month vacation in the United States. He said yesterday (the 7th) that as far as he can remember, no other issue has aroused more public concern in the United States than the amendment to the Neutrality Act. The abolition of the arms embargo is undoubtedly a completely unanimous desire. He refused to comment on how the amendment to the Neutrality Act will affect the interests of the United States in the Pacific.</p>
<p>American Finance Benefits Greatly</p>
<p>He only said that this law was specifically designed for the European situation, and it is too early to discuss other repercussions. When the clause banning arms in the Neutrality Act was not abolished, politicians sincerely listened to the opinions of the people across the country on this issue. Now that the Neutrality Act has been amended, American finance will benefit greatly, because the reopening of factories will employ a large number of people to manufacture goods to supply the Allied Powers.</p>
<p>General Opinion Supports Britain and France</p>
<p>Moreover, the United States will have better technical preparations and can defend itself if there is any threat. In his opinion, the vast majority of Americans oppose Hitler and quite support the Allied Powers. The emergence of the sentiment of supporting the Allied Powers is mostly related to sympathy for Czechoslovakia and Poland, which were produced after the First World War because of the American advocacy of the theory of national self-determination.</p>
<p>Presidential Election Is Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>Unless the United States actually participates in the war and President Roosevelt needs to stay in office, President Roosevelt will not compete for a third term in the 1940 presidential election. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have outstanding talents, such as McNutt, the former commissioner of the United States to the Philippines of the Democratic Party, and Dewey Chu, the New York district lawyer of the Republican Party. It is still too early to predict which party will win the presidential office. He has been away from the United States for a long time. This time he returned to China and saw that business was better and everyone seemed quite happy. According to the Continental Daily, Max, the secretary of the Shanghai Committee for Assisting European Refugees, took the American ship President Coolidge to Manila yesterday (the 7th) to provide opportunities for the goods made by the European refugees in this port and for professional refugees to develop in the Philippines. Mr. Ma's trip was at the invitation of the Philippine Committee for European Refugees, which is currently</p>
<p>Actively Planning</p>
<p>To settle Jewish refugees in Mindanao. Mr. Ma told reporters yesterday that in addition to discussing settlement matters with Jewish leaders, he also carried hundreds of samples of goods made by refugees in this city to promote sales. On the one hand, he seeks employment for professional refugees. In order to facilitate work after arriving in Manila, he has compiled details such as the types of goods and the skills of refugees. With the help of charitable organizations here and overseas, the committee in this city is still taking care of more than 16,000 registered Jewish refugees and providing three meals a day to more than 7,000 refugees and preparing six shelters for accommodation. According to Mr. Ma, this trip to Manila will last at least four weeks.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Pay Great Attention to the Dismissal of Refugees and Are Studying and Planning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Aftercare Office convened representatives from various charities at the association at No. 93 Guangdong Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss aftercare matters such as refugee production work, evacuation and repatriation, and job placement. It was resolved to organize a research committee on the dismissal of refugees, with seven committee members, including Li Guiyong of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, Zhao Puchu of the Cilian General Association, Zhu Airen of the Cilian Branch, and one representative each from the Aftercare Office and Supervision Office of the Association Affairs Office, and chaired by Wei Bozhen, Secretary General of the Association. The task of the committee is to study a concrete plan for the dismissal of refugees and submit it to various charities for implementation. The Board of Directors of the Association also attaches great importance to the dispersal of refugees. However, most of the refugees who remain in Shanghai are old, weak, women, and children, and have no home to return to. Consideration should be given to how to help them continue to maintain their lives after they are dismissed. Therefore, the Association authorities have proposed to raise a dismissal fund of 1 million yuan so that the dismissed refugees will not be displaced again. The Board of Directors has appointed five directors, Michail, Keshchek, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Mao Lishi, to form a subcommittee to plan and implement this. However, now it is winter, which is not a suitable time to dismiss refugees, and the evacuation will be carried out during the spring plowing season next year.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Between New Light and Lianhua: Feng Gengguang Petitions for Retrial; Defendant in Retrial Applies for Service by Public Notice, Intending to Obscure Debt Responsibility; Final Debate Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Feng Gengguang, chairman of Xinhua Bank, previously co-invested with Luo Mingyou, Li Minwei, and others to establish Lianhua Film Company. The head office was located in Hong Kong, and it operated under a British merchant's signboard. Luo Mingyou served as the manager, while Feng Gengguang and Li Minwei both served as directors. The company produced quite a few films. In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], a contract was signed with New Light Grand Theater, giving New Light</p>
<p>the right of first showing.</p>
<p>New Light also provided Lianhua with a deposit of 20,000 yuan. Later, Lianhua stopped producing films, so there were no new films to be shown at New Light. Subsequently, Rui Qingrong, the manager of New Light Grand Theater, retained lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a suit in the Second Special Court's civil division, requesting a judgment ordering Luo Mingyou, Feng Gengguang, Li Minwei, and others to jointly and severally return a deposit of 14,000 yuan in cash and uncashed checks totaling 6,000 yuan. During the court's hearing of the case, because Feng Gengguang's address was unknown,</p>
<p>service by public notice</p>
<p>was legally conducted. As a result, Luo Mingyou, Feng Gengguang, Li Minwei, and others were ordered to return 14,000 yuan in national currency to the plaintiff Rui Qingrong, and provisional execution was granted. Because Feng Gengguang had a substantial amount of stock in the Bank of China, the plaintiff Rui Qingrong applied to the court for execution of Feng Gengguang's stock. Feng Gengguang, fearing implication due to Lianhua Film Company's substantial debts, recently retained lawyer Cai Rudong to file a</p>
<p>retrial lawsuit</p>
<p>in the Second Special Court's civil division. The court approved the request, and yesterday, Judge Yu Changzi convened the Fourth Civil Court to summon both parties. Both sides were represented by lawyers. According to lawyer Cai Rudong, representing the retrial plaintiff Feng Gengguang, the reason for initiating the retrial was that the plaintiff Feng Gengguang held a prominent position in the financial world and had a fixed residence. The retrial defendant, during the hearing in your court, applied for service by public notice, claiming that the plaintiff's address was unknown. Their</p>
<p>intention to obscure the lawsuit</p>
<p>is evident. The retrial defendant knew that the plaintiff was a shareholder of the Bank of China and deliberately implicated the plaintiff. In fact, the retrial plaintiff had already left Lianhua Film Company in August of the 26th year of the Republic [1937]. Even if we take a step back and say that Lianhua Film Company was a limited liability company, and the plaintiff was merely a shareholder, he should not be held jointly and severally liable for the debts. We request that your court rescind the original judgment and dismiss the retrial defendant's lawsuit. Subsequently, lawyer Yuan Yang'an, representing the defendant Rui Qingrong, responded that</p>
<p>the retrial plaintiff's</p>
<p>agent's statements were not legally valid reasons. We request that your court dismiss the retrial plaintiff's lawsuit. Furthermore, according to the retrial plaintiff's representing lawyer, both parties in this case were in Hong Kong, and it was heard that Du Yuesheng was mediating, with the hope of a settlement. The court examined the arguments, ruled the debate was over, announced the end of the hearing, and awaited the judgment.</p>
<h3>Major Burglary Case in Hongkou: Fugitive Surrenders, Claims to Have Been Falsely Accused</h3>
<p>In the spring of this year, a series of major burglaries occurred in Japanese-owned shops and residences in the Hongkou district. Among them, the Nine Blessings Market at 237 Wusong Road suffered the heaviest losses, with over 17,000 Japanese yen and two jeweled rings stolen. Afterward, detectives from the Hongkou police apprehended</p>
<p>thieves</p>
<p>Zhu Chunbao and Lu Yonglin, along with Zhang Zhuqing, who was hoarding stolen goods, at the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. After investigation and trial, Zhu was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Lu to two years, and Zhang to six months. Other offenders were fined separately. However, Zhang Zhuqing, during questioning, confessed that he had</p>
<p>transferred 4,000 yen</p>
<p>of the stolen goods to his fellow townsman from Yangzhou, Zong Guisheng. At that time, the investigating officers, based on Zhang's confession, went to search Zong's residence at 11 Tianfu Lane, North Jiangxi Road. Because Zong had already fled after hearing the news, only a small amount of stolen money was recovered. Subsequently, the court issued an arrest warrant, ordering detectives to investigate closely. After more than half a year, the fugitive</p>
<p>did not dare to show his face.</p>
<p>Now, having learned that Zhang Zhuqing had died in prison, he surrendered himself to the Hongkou police the day before yesterday, claiming that he had been falsely accused of receiving stolen goods. The police detained him and handed him over to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Fang Qinghuan interrogated him. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the details of the major burglary case and stated that the defendant,</p>
<p>when surrendering to the police, said</p>
<p>that he had returned to his hometown in March of this year and only returned to Shanghai on October 31st. The police believed he had received stolen goods, so the police needed to investigate further and requested a postponement. The defendant then retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang for defense. Judge Fang then questioned Zong Guisheng and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, with a retrial scheduled for the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Hengmaoli Morphine Case: Suspect Arrested and Handed Over; Korean Handed Over to Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>Chen Manzhao, a tailor, was the second landlord at 15 Hengmaoli, Eight Immortals Bridge. Out of greed, Chen rented the kitchen to Korean Kim Ki (transliteration) to open a morphine smoking den for a monthly rent of 40 yuan. Kim then hired Chen Tiansheng and Gao Wanyuan as attendants in the den. After the den was established, countless men and women were victimized. Around 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, the French Concession police learned of this and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to search the premises, seizing five packets of morphine and drug paraphernalia. Sixty-four Chinese men and women were arrested on the spot. The arrested Korean Kim Ki has been handed over to the Japanese Consulate for handling. Chen Manzhao, Chen Tiansheng, Gao Wanyuan, and sixty-four customers, including Chen Guoliang and Chen Wangshi, were handed over to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court at 2 p.m. yesterday. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated and ordered them to be detained, with a retrial scheduled for the 13th.</p>
<h3>Earth Merchant Arrested, Yesterday Handed Over to Court Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Chief Inspector Ye Yuxi of the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Police Station, along with detectives Liu Zhaonian and Li Shugui, cracked down on an opium den at 14 Fenyang Lane, Foch Road, on June 16th of this year, arresting offenders Wang Rongshen, Weng Yongde, and others. They were handed over to the First Special Court. It was learned that the den was jointly operated by four Chaozhou people: Weng Fanting (aka Weng Hongxiang, Weng Ajiu), Zhou Ruoting, Wu Pan, and Zhang Chaoyuan. Currently, Weng and others have all escaped. In addition to sentencing Zai Rongshen and others, arrest warrants were issued for the fugitives Weng Fanting and others. Months passed until yesterday afternoon at 2:40 p.m., when Weng Fanting was finally apprehended at the intersection of Hubei Road and Fourth Avenue, brought to the Chengdu Road police station, and handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case, indicting him under Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on the Suppression of Opium Crimes. After the presiding judge interrogated him, he ordered the defendant to be detained and await further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Young Girls, Arrested and Sentenced to Three Years</h3>
<p>Fang Zhengqing (42 years old), a woman from Suzhou residing at 14 Tingyun Lane, Pingjili Road, recently kidnapped three young girls from Hengjing, Suzhou: Fang Xuemei (15 years old), Lu Lindi (17 years old), and Fang Xuedi (19 years old). On the 6th of this month, she entrusted fellow villagers Bai Jingui and Bai Hedi to escort the three young girls to Wharf No. 4 on the Bund, hoping to take them to Hankou and force them into prostitution. The wharf inspectors discovered this and, together with the Chinese police, arrested the defendants. Yesterday, they were handed over to the First Criminal Court for prosecution on charges of obstructing public morals. Judge Xiao held a hearing and sentenced Fang Zhengqing to three years of imprisonment for inducing respectable women into prostitution for profit. Bai Hedi was found not guilty. Bai Jingui was remanded in custody for a retrial at a later date. The victims, Fang Xuemei, Lu Lindi, and Fang Xuedi, were sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Man Feigning Illness to Evade Arrest, Found with a Large Handgun, Attempting to Create Terror</h3>
<p>Around 7 p.m. yesterday, several Russian police officers from the French Concession Police Department were ordered to inspect pedestrians in the Kazeier Road area. While passing the intersection of Limei Road, they suddenly noticed a man, about thirty years old, walking quickly from Kazeier Road into Limei Road, seemingly trying to avoid them. The police officers became suspicious and quickly chased after him, stopping him and searching him. They found a six-inch handgun hidden in his right sleeve, loaded with twelve bullets. Suspecting that he was planning something, they immediately took him to the police station for investigation. It was learned that this man was from Ningbo and indeed intended to cause a terrorist incident in the area. However, because he was discovered early, he was unable to carry out his plans. It was also heard that the weapon he was carrying was related to previous assassination cases. He is currently under thorough investigation at the police station.</p>
<h3>Commendation for Arresting Thieves</h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the Jinchang Cotton Cloth Store on Zilai Street in the French Concession was robbed by six thieves. The police officers arrived promptly, capturing four thieves on the spot and wounding one bandit, Yang Dayan, who later died from his injuries. The French Concession Police Department has decided to promote Chinese detective Yang and Chinese police officer No. 19 in recognition of their bravery in capturing the thieves, and to award a bonus to the Chinese police officer as an encouragement.</p>
<h3>Bribery Case in Prison: Chen Zhanxiong Surrenders Yesterday; Immediately Detained, Guarantor Released</h3>
<p>Chen Zhanxiong, the owner of the Ywentai Club (i.e., gambling den) in the French Concession, who is also the owner of the Anlegong Hotel dance hall on Avenue Edward VII, was arrested by the French Concession police earlier this month for opium smoking and handed over to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where he was indicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, and sent to prison for compulsory rehabilitation. While in custody, Chen</p>
<p>committed bribery.</p>
<p>As a result, Wang, the prosecutor of the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court, investigated and indicted him for bribery. The guards Luo Zhiyi and the fugitives Jiang Nai and Tu Gang were also indicted for dereliction of duty in connection with the case. When Judge Zhang Minsheng held a hearing on the case a few days ago, Chen Zhanxiong was released on bail due to illness but failed to appear in court. Therefore, Judge Zhang ordered the bailiffs to</p>
<p>arrest Chen's guarantor,</p>
<p>Xia Dajin (the owner of the Dahua Bread Company at 4 Xinle Lane, Nanyang Bridge), considering that Xia had committed offenses such as facilitating escape. Xia was handed over to the Procuratorate of the court for investigation. After investigating the case the day before yesterday, Prosecutor Wang ordered the detention of the defendant Xia Dajin and set a deadline for handing over Chen Zhanxiong. Chen Zhanxiong, fearing that his guarantor would be implicated, went to the Second Special Court with his defense lawyer Jiang Pingfan at around 5 p.m. yesterday to surrender. Prosecutor Wang</p>
<p>convened the Second Criminal Court</p>
<p>that evening to conduct an interrogation. Chen Zhanxiong denied any intention to escape. The defense lawyers for Xia Dajin, Wu Peng and Wu Zhengjue, successively requested that Xia Dajin be released. After reviewing the statements, Prosecutor Wang ordered Chen Zhanxiong to be detained and sent to the Criminal Court for trial. Xia Dajin was released on bail, with Wu Peng and Wu Zhengjue acting as guarantors, pending investigation.</p>

<p>Qu A'san, a Jiangbei native working at Qianhe Indigo Store at 138 Jiangxi Road, was ordered to collect a remittance of 1,000 yuan from the post office on North Sichuan Road yesterday morning around 11 a.m. Unbeknownst to him, two robbers spotted him and followed him. As he was walking to the intersection of Sanhe Lane, north of the Xingye Building on Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, the two robbers drew guns and stepped forward to rob him. Qu, terrified, shouted "Robbers!" enraging the robbers, who shot Qu in the right corner of his eye. He immediately bled profusely and fell to the ground.

<h3>Memorial Ceremony for Fei Longding of Songjiang to be Held Today at Fazang Temple</h3>
<p>Fei Longding of Yun Jian, renowned in Jiangnan for his calligraphy, painting, and seal engraving, traveled to western Guangdong during his prime and was an exile in Japan during Yuan Shikai's government. After 1915, he retired to his hometown, advocated the Songfeng Society, and enjoyed poetry and wine. His old family treasures were sought for authentication, and those who obtained his inscriptions cherished them as invaluable. During the fall of Rongcheng in previous years, Fei was unable to escape in time and died in a boat under the Shengsheng Bridge outside the North Gate of Songjiang. How tragic! Now that two weeks have passed since Duke Lu's death, Dongpo's birthday coincides with his sixtieth year. His former friends Cheng Yuncen, Chen Taoyi, Gao Chuiwan, and others initiated a ritual for him on the 9th of this month at Fazang Lecture Temple, and a public memorial service will be held at noon. It is expected that there will be an endless stream of artists coming to mourn in plain carriages and white horses.</p>

<h3>Preface to The Bi Xue Hua [Crimson Blood Flower]</h3>
<p>— Chun Can</p>
<p>"Bi Xue Hua" is a historical drama, and Master Rihui is a historian. It is certainly delightful and satisfying for a historian to write a historical drama.</p>
<p>In my layman's opinion, in addition to providing "appreciation," drama should also provide people with a "lesson," especially at this time and in this place. What is the lesson of Bi Xue Hua? The situation at the end of the Ming Dynasty was very different from today. The first relevant factor is that it was still an era of royal autocracy. Because the monarchical power at the end of an autocratic era is declining, it cannot produce the highest and most virtuous leaders. The Hongguang Emperor is out of the question. Although the Longwu Emperor had the ambition to restore the dynasty, he was constrained by the warlord Zheng Zhilong and ultimately accomplished nothing. Also, because the masses in the autocratic era were disorganized, they could not produce a great and progressive party. The literati of the Fushe Society were not enough to take on the great affairs of the world. The best talents, like Sun Wugong, could only fight and die alone. Since there were no highest and most virtuous leaders to preside over all military and political affairs, and there was no great and progressive party to universally propagate, train, and organize the masses, the resistance at that time was doomed. Now, however, things are vastly different.</p>
<p>According to the original text of "Banqiao Zaji," we are somewhat wronging Cai Ruheng. He was an official who held the important post of Vice Commissioner of the military defense of Luzhou and failed to die as a martyr when the city fell. He was a powerful man who seized the love of others with three thousand gold pieces. However, he did not become a traitor. Now, we have no choice but to wrong him. "Who cares about the rights and wrongs after death? The whole village listens to the singing of Cai Zhonglang." We can only use this to console ourselves. However, what I consider important is that we can see a certain kind of face on the model of Cai Ruheng!</p>

<h3>180th Anniversary of Schiller's Birth</h3>
<p>— Ou Zhi</p>
<p>Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller, the great German poet and playwright, will be commemorated on November 10th this year on the 180th anniversary of his birth.</p>
<p>In his homeland, after Hitler took power, all writers who shouted for freedom, even classical writers from hundreds of years ago, were on the list for "legal action." Heine's poetry books were burned by the public, Goethe's plays were listed as harmful literature, and Schiller's plays were "advised" to stop being performed.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, when Schiller's "William Tell" was performed in a theater in Berlin, because the poet's epigram was transmitted from the stage: "We want to be as free as our ancestors, since it is better to die than to live without freedom!" The audience under the fascist rule, lacking freedom, responded to this call to fight for freedom with enthusiastic applause throughout the hall, forming a political demonstration.</p>
<p>Therefore, so-called "hack writers" even filed a complaint with the German secret political police against this poet who had been dead for one hundred and thirty-four years! The charges were: harming the state, condoning regicide, advocating individualism, and advocating liberalism.</p>
<p>Heine, who was deprived of his nationality, obtained a new homeland in the Soviet Union (and soon Soviet poets decided to accept Heine into Soviet citizenship). Schiller, who was persecuted, was welcomed and supported abroad. Even in China, in Shanghai, which has become an isolated island, Schiller's famous play "Love and Intrigue" has appeared on the repertoire of the Juyi Society. In order to commemorate this great poet and playwright Schiller, who shouted for freedom and liberation and was persecuted by some reactionary people, on the 180th anniversary of his birth, we hope that this play will be performed soon.</p>
<p>Schiller was born on November 10, 1759, in Marbach, Württemberg, Germany. His father was a military medical officer. Schiller was also forced to attend a military school by Duke Karl Eugen from a young age.</p>
<p>While still in school, he wrote a famous play, "The Robbers," which he published at his own expense in 1781. The great Russian critic Belinsky said: "The Robbers' is like lava erupting from the depths of a young, passionate soul." It achieved great success, but aroused the punishment of Duke Karl Eugen, who forbade Schiller from writing. Schiller then fled to Mannheim, and in 1784 "Love and Intrigue" was performed. According to Engels, "Love and Intrigue" is "the first German play with political tendencies."</p>
<p>After escaping from Stuttgart, Schiller wandered around for several years, living in poverty.</p>
<p>Schiller's second period was as a history teacher at the University of Jena. At that time, he wrote "History of the Decline of the Netherlands," "History of the Thirty Years' War," and many philosophical aesthetic essays. In the late 1900s, Schiller resumed writing poetry and prose, and his famous works "Song of the Bell" and classical plays appeared: the trilogy "Wallenstein" (performed in 1798), "Mary Stuart" (1800), and "The Maid of Orleans" (1801). In addition, there was "The Bride of Messina" in 1803, and "William Tell" in 1804.</p>
<p>His later works, especially "William Tell," depict the people's struggle against oppressors, which is similar to "The Robbers" and calls for fighting for freedom and independence.</p>
<p>A love of humanity, a belief in a bright future, the creation of German classical drama, and the great achievements of dramatic art made Schiller one of the world's greatest geniuses of culture.</p>
<p>Schiller died in 1805 at the age of only forty-six.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Bustling City</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>1. Night Walk</p>
<p>Returning from the bustling city, I carried a face full of dust. The cold wind of November brushed my face, and I felt a chill.</p>
<p>Pedestrians still hurried back and forth, streetlights shining faintly.</p>
<p>Plane trees by the road occasionally dropped their leaves, pedestrians stepping on them with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>The mood of the night walk was as heavy as shrouded in thick fog, the watch in my pocket constantly playing its marching tune. I wanted to find a vast square to see the midnight moon, but the clamor of the bustling city never ceased. Towards the endlessly long night street, I resented the leisure of the night dwellers. Scattered around were the drunken states of Russian vagrants and the shameless vulgar songs from the bars.</p>
<p>On the street, I surprisingly shook hands with a familiar guest from the countryside.</p>
<p>"Hello! When did you come to Shanghai?" "Well! Just a few days ago. What a coincidence, meeting you!"</p>
<p>Grasping his hand tightly, gazing at his face, listening quietly to the familiar local accent. However, he was thinner, his mustache seeming to still carry the dust from the sandy plains of his hometown.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you: do you remember the news from the Han River bank? Now Xiao Lin and Lao Chen are locked up in the ×× Military Police Headquarters; the charge is: disobeying them!"</p>
<p>Many people squeezed past me, he spoke urgently into my ear. Occasionally, he turned his head to look at the clock at the entrance of a store.</p>
<p>"I'm preparing to go to Hong Kong at dawn, decided to go to the mainland by land, there, we have our base camp, we have our mountain-based iron army... Huang! How are you?" he asked me lightly. He grabbed my arm, although the night was even colder, it increased the low-pressure blood tide in my heart, my nerves were jumping rapidly, I felt unparalleled joy, and the warm friendship strengthened my fighting intentions a lot.</p>
<p>"You're really leaving!"</p>
<p>He took a few letters from his pocket smoothly, I knew these were notices from a certain working team in the mainland. When he handed me a cigarette, under the light of a struck match I saw his eyes spitting flames of fire, strong resentment of revenge…</p>
<p>"I want to leave—" It seemed that such a voice came from the fence of the park over there. …</p>
<p>2. Beneath the Window</p>
<p>Sitting alone under a bright window, gazing at the clear sky, the autumn mood of Jiangnan is so profound...</p>
<p>Looking back at the vast horizon, watching the floating clouds drift across the blue sky, stirring up a recollection of love. Let the bats at dusk carry the eerie gloom of the night, and the pergola still retains my laughing dreams of the past.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about? You should write!"</p>
<p>I finished reading the book borrowed from a friend on the desk, this book from my hometown. I remember Sela-fimovich's Iron Flood on the bookshelf, Gorky's Mother, and the pen that accompanied me for ten years...</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about? You should write!"</p>
<p>There is manuscript paper in front of me, and letters from home. I pick up the unfamiliar pen heavily, because this pen lacks a connection with me. Although I am willing to cherish it and make good use of it, it is even more unfamiliar and sluggish to me.</p>
<p>Turning over each page, the great epic of the era is clearly laid out before me. Although I do not want to sigh with personal sentiment over past worries. However, when you strain your eyes to look intently, the stench of blood and the searing heat of fire create a dazzling picture that further gives me a song of joy.</p>
<p>So on the paper, I began to build up points of sentences: praise of red, depictions of fire, the heroes of the brave men fighting fiercely on the edge of the ancient river, the homesickness under the clouds of Lingnan; there are loud songs and low chants, in the noisy city map, I love it, because this is an unforgettable and sacred miracle.</p>
<p>An individual yearns for a string of exquisite dreams, the sound of the night's footsteps silently passing before my eyes. I hope for the future dawn after the vast long night. Bathed in darkness, I finally joyfully finished writing the blank spaces of the manuscript paper, and then gave a letter to a distant friend</p>
<p>"I don't like to yearn for the moon over the ancient Roman city, or the boats on the canals of Venice. I like the lofty pyramids of Egypt, the solemn Red Square of Moscow—tomorrow, please look at the footprints of our comrades on the Tank Fortress of China, on the peaks of Baiyun Mountain, on the banks of the Pearl River, the breath of iron will overturn the smog of the sky..."</p>
<p>It was dusk, and my exhilarating laughter was stirring around. Editor</p>
<h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The sensation and deep impact of "Bi Xue Hua," also known as "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty," were not accidental. The script and the content and skills of the performance are certainly essential elements of success, but in my opinion, the audience's psychological preparation and acceptance are even more important. This narrative piece is written by a senior member of the party and the country, who is also the host of the South Society. His observations are naturally profound, and I believe that readers will agree after reading this article.</p>
<p>The "Rose Academy" listed in the back of this issue (6th) was an advertisement. Please do not misunderstand it.</p>
<h3>Some Impressions</h3>
<p>— Xijin</p>
<p>——Returning from the Language Exhibition</p>
<p>The preservation and dissemination of human civilization depend on language. It is difficult for us to imagine that if humans did not have language, or if language had not progressed as much as it has in modern times, then our modern civilization would definitely not be what it is today.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we pay a little attention to language, we cannot help but think that humans have spent so much energy on the improvement of language. Every region and every race has their own language, and they gradually improve it, until it reaches the most reasonable and most applicable form.</p>
<p>In the language exhibition, we saw such a rich collection of various language materials. Vertically, from ancient times to today's changes; horizontally, from the characters we are accustomed to using to the numerous types in various countries and regions, and also various things, tools, customs, ... related to language, inevitably aroused our research interest, to know it, to understand it. Many antiques, as well as calligraphy with artistic value, are precious, beautiful, and also worth appreciating.</p>
<p>This is a grand exhibition of an academic nature, but it is a knowledge that every citizen can know and should know. Many dialect performances and deaf-mute performances also add a lot of interest.</p>
<p>From this, we see the forward progress, and further progress, of primitive language and modern language.</p>

<h3>Northwest Film Company Revived After the War; "North China is Ours" Completed Filming</h3>
<p>— Cui Ping</p>
<p>General Yan Xishan, who is now in charge of military affairs in Shanxi Province, invested 100,000 yuan in 1935 to establish the Northwest Film Company, hiring Shi Jipu, who had previously worked at Lianhua and Tianyi, to preside over the factory affairs. At that time, new-style photographic machinery was purchased and a photographic field was built, and the momentum was quite large. First, several educational short films focusing on locality were shot, and the results were not bad. Later, a historical feature film "Lofty Ambitions for a Thousand Autumns" was produced, and Yan and important figures in the Shanxi military world dedicated themselves to the film. However, Shi was also involved in other constraints and failed to be fully responsible, and only half of the film was shot; and the part that was shot became a waste film due to the dim lighting. The Northwest Company was temporarily suspended, and the people who were recruited at that time included director Wang Bin, screenwriter Song Zhide, and actors Wang Ping and Tian Fang. Although there was talk of revitalizing it, it never materialized.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, Yan deeply felt that in order to achieve victory in the war of resistance, propaganda was also important in addition to military affairs, and film was the most effective propaganda tool to reach everyone. Therefore, last year, the Northwest Company was revived again, named Northwest Film Company, with Liang Yanwu as the factory director and Wen Songkang as the production director. In addition, most of the actors and staff are former stars and people from Lianhua and Yihua companies. Their knowledge and experience are very rich, so although they are located in the border area and the machinery is not very complete, everyone's life and work are able to struggle in a difficult environment.</p>
<p>In the past year, they have completed a realistic and systematic national defense film "North China is Ours." In the middle, the military struggles in Shanxi Province since the War of Resistance are actually photographed and interspersed, and linked to a dramatic plot to form a national defense story film. The technical achievements have reached the level above that of general national defense films.</p>
<p>"North China is Ours" was recently transported to Chongqing and publicly invited the cultural circles to visit. With one voice, the critics said that this is an ideal national defense film. The compatriots who stayed on the isolated island will naturally not have the opportunity to see this film for a while. Here, we will record the outline of the story we learned as follows:</p>
<p>In the sound of bugles.</p>
<p>Mules and camels carry heavy military supplies and drag them to the barren areas of the northwest. Several drivers lightly flick their whips. White snow, red blood, adorn the magnificent mountains and rivers. The strong men of the Northwest fight in these snowdrifts and bloodstains to defend our North China!</p>
<p>The Lvliang Mountains and the Taihang Mountains are full of mountains. An enemy crematorium is prepared in every mountain. The Yellow River overflows with torrents... The Chinese nation roars!</p>
<p>Guerrilla fighters look out with weapons in their hands on the mountaintops and in the trenches. Gunshots, artillery fire, shouts, everything is jumping.</p>
<p>Crowds of people all over the mountains and fields are rushing forward. The masses are waiting in teams, waiting to rescue our wounded soldiers. Men are carrying tea and water, women are sewing and mending, and children are checking road passes...</p>
<p>The captured people are tirelessly learning and working, making countless anti-war leaflets to expose the weaknesses of the invaders. They join hands with us to oppose their militaristic warlords and seek the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of their people!</p>
<p>The city, the great buildings destroyed by the invaders - artistic cave dwellings are like tall buildings, standing everywhere. Inside, grand group meetings, review meetings, administrative meetings, and military-civilian joint meetings are being held... Commanders-in-chief Zhu and Yan are holding hands tightly, like two great engines.</p>
<p>Self-defense teams, women's teams, children's groups, workers, farmers, and various national salvation associations are gathering like iron teams, moving and singing, and the songs are shaking the fields.</p>
<p>Strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, not allowing others to eat a drop of water, dismantling roads and demolishing cities, not allowing others to take advantage of a single point. The current is flashing, like the audience's heart is jumping, the blood is boiling, scene after scene, in each lens, there are majestic stories, there are beautiful pictures, there are enthusiastic true feelings, there are bitterness, there are struggles... The concrete facts of the war of resistance in North China are clearly shown before our eyes, pointing out "North China is Ours"!</p>
<h3>Grand Bell Theatre Company Announces Public Performance of Two Plays</h3>
<p>In the past, the "Sino-French Theatre Company" finally disintegrated due to insufficient organizational strength under inevitable circumstances, and the closure of the Sino-French Drama School followed. This was also within our expectations. The bankruptcy of the two drama cadres of this same system undoubtedly strengthened the organizational strength of the "Grand Bell Theatre Company."</p>
<p>The establishment of the Grand Bell Theatre Company was just when "The True Story of Ah Q" was being performed. At first, only a few students from various universities in Shanghai were responsible. Until the disintegration of the "Sino-French Theatre Company," many students who had received nearly a year of training at the Sino-French Drama School were finally added. Naturally, the increase in the main force of the Grand Bell Theatre Company is conceivable. Recently, it is said that on the morning of the 12th of this month, the first experimental performance will be held at the Xuan Palace Theater. We cannot say that this is not a gratifying news.</p>
<p>The program for this public performance, in addition to the three one-act plays "Walking" written by Wu Tian, "White Tea" by Ban Ke, and "Twilight of the Ancient Times" by Nie Luo Boer, also includes Chen Gexin's accompaniment, as well as two dance dramas by Wu Xiaobang, who has left Shanghai. Undoubtedly, this maintains the unique dance characteristics of the former "Sino-French Drama School." The students of the "Sino-French Drama School" account for a considerable majority of the staff and actors who participated in the work. Therefore, the success of the performance can be expected. (Xiang Liangbing)</p>
<h3>Bao Lian Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>Moliere's comedy "The Miser" had a Chinese translation in the former Commercial Press, but it was never brought to the Chinese stage. It was not until recently that the Shanghai Theatre Association performed it regularly at the Xuan Palace that this script was adapted by Gu Zhongyi and met us under the name "The Art of Making Money." Then, Rafi's "Ying Lian" also brought it to the "Lafayette" again under the name "The Miser." Not to mention that these adaptations have the meaning of the adapter included, but since the performances all use the words of Moliere's original work, it should be said that there are three different scripts.</p>
<p>Now it is said that Gu's translation of "The Art of Making Money" will be performed again for the second time. The performance is by an amateur Bao Lian Drama Troupe, which is organized by the Amateur Association of the Shanghai Insurance Industry. In the past, they participated in charity performances and performed "Before Sunrise." It is a group with a rough scale among amateur theater groups. The director is also Miss Wu Ming, who once starred in the drama club's "The Art of Making Money." It is expected that the results will not be too bad.</p>
<p>People who care about the Shanghai theatre movement "at this moment and in this place" may be happy to hear this news. Now they have decided to perform at the Carlton on the 12th of this month. (Wen)</p>
<h3>Li Li Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday and Returned to Hong Kong - Soon She Will Return to Shanghai to Appear on the Screen</h3>
<p>Li Li from Beiping suddenly appeared at the Xianle Dance Palace, which surprised people. It turned out that she passed through Shanghai on her way back from the United States, and stayed for one night to meet her old friends. She still took the original Coolidge President ship back to Hong Kong yesterday morning. She is still charming and beautiful, and her clothes are especially novel. She said that she will arrange everything when she returns to Hong Kong, and will soon come to Shanghai to join a film company and resume her screen life. This woman, who is both a film and dance star, has a wandering track, running east and west. I don't know what she is busy with? It's really interesting. The picture above is her recent portrait.</p>
<h3>Wu Suqiu Takes the Stage Again - Has Changed From Empty Talk to a Fact -</h3>
<p>— Mei Yi</p>
<p>The beautiful actress Wu Suqiu will meet us again on the red carpet. I have more opportunities to meet with Ms. Wu, so I know more about her recent actions and future performance news. I will record the essentials to inform readers.</p>
<p>Since Ms. Wu's performances in Shanghai became popular, theaters in various places have been vying to invite her. Recently, she has received letters from five or six companies, including Qingdao, Dalian, Harbin, Hong Kong, and Liaoning. The Xinhua Company in Shanghai has also repeatedly advised her to shoot costume films. However, Wu Suqiu's desire to return to the north is very strong. Xinhua plans to wait until next spring to make a decision. However, the goal of going to Harbin is likely to be realized within the year, because the two sides had an agreement before she came to Shanghai at the beginning of autumn.</p>
<p>This time, she will take the stage again at the Xin Xin Theatre, which has changed from empty talk to a fact. It is stated that the performance period will be at most eight to ten days. After Liang Yunqiu's ten-day period expires, Suqiu will be allowed to continue performing. Three days of warm-up shows have been initially decided. The first day (11th) is "One Hibiscus Sword", the second day is Sunday, and two shows should be performed. The daytime shows are "Spring and Autumn Match" and "Ba Luo He", and the night show is the famous Xun school play "Zhang Yuzhen". The third day will be either "Human Face Peach Blossom" or "Female Beating Stick Out of the Box". According to her, since she started performing, she has been most interested in the play Ba Luo He, because the play has bar tricks and special fighting scenes. Every time it is performed in the ancient capital, the seats are always especially crowded. This time, when it is performed in Shanghai, Chen Shaolin is specially invited to guest star as Luo Hongxun in the first half, and Liang Huichao is invited to play this role in the second half because there is an important fight scene. Suqiu has very harmonious relationships in Shanghai. Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Xiaolin, Pang Laichen, Yu Yefeng, Zhang Yanshan and other gentlemen have all praised her unanimously. She is truly a gifted star in the Kun opera world.</p>
<p>Lu Ming recently starred in the new film "Xiangjiang Song Girl" at Yihua. The picture shows the scene of being troubled by falling in love. This film will be released soon at the Xinguang Theatre.</p>
<h3>Wang Yurong Takes the Stage for the First Time</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Yurong, who has been famous for a long time and was hired to perform for gold, arrived at the end of last month with her teacher, the old enshrined Wang Yaoqing, and a large number of Beijing-style actors. Yurong left Shanghai ten years ago, and now she has returned south after completing her studies. The opening show on the first night of the seventh day was Wang Baochuan, from running on the slope to ascending the throne. With the famous iron-throated old male actor Yang Baosen's Xue Pinggui, it was even more exciting. Before eight o'clock, the gold seats were already full. When I entered the hospital, it happened that the rising star Jing Qiu Shengrong was performing Muhu Pass. Qiu is the main red actor of the station, and he is especially hardworking, so he is undoubtedly welcomed by the audience. After Qiu was Wu Yanheng's Qiwu Mountain. This play is about Yue Fei's recapture of He Yuanqing. There are not many performances of this play on the sea. Wu played the main character He Yuanqing, wearing a large armor, wearing feathers, hanging a sword, and starting the scene, singing the blowing tune, with a sweet and thick voice, quite flavorful; and the waist and legs also show kung fu, the side style on the body, and the stability and strength of the martial arts work, which is a typical Yang style. Yurong's voice in the curtain was hard-earned, and she won the full house, which proves that there are many sympathizers. The large section of slow beat, clever tune one after another, the two-six flowing water, the singing of the mouth and the other, etc., are lovable, and the more she sings, the more powerful, and Baosen's voice is full, still able to harmonize without chaos, quite the wonderful contrast. The calculation of grain and white mouth is smooth, the body saves steps, all are good, and the dignified and dignified appearance is especially unmatched by vulgar actors. The singing and acting of ascending the throne are all excellent. With the assistance of Baosen's hard work. Tongshen Zhongren and others helped him, and Wang Yaoqing's personal supervision of the scene added a lot of color. Yurong made a splash, and was so loved by the old Wang, which is also a great thing.</p>
