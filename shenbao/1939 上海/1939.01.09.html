<p>社評</p>
<h3>期望五中全會</h3>
<p>中國國民黨第四屆中央執行委員第五决全體大會。簡稱五中全會；頃據渝電。確定於本月二十日，在重慶開慕，距今蓋祗一旬。按之國民黨總章。中委全會之於黨內，乃爲僅决於全國代表大會之機構，每六個月始召集一决，會址必在中央政府所在地；是其本質與權限之重大，無待贅言。允以國政黨治，所繫復非一黨黨內之事；近二十年來之黨國大計，悉淵源於此。况在非常時期，抗戰建國，千端萬緒，瞻前顧後，繼往開來；或待探討，或待力行，動輒有關黨國前途；是以此决之五中全會，固非曩昔每半年例會之比也、</p>
<p>五中全會之議案議程，局外無從預聞；即待决之最重要主題，亦未若歷屆全會之先得覘知之於中央常務執行委員會之决議；主要議題旣迄今未經透露，記者即無自而就事論事。雖然，有若干事態。爲吾人居常所深感未安，茲請的略陳之。愚者千慮，容有一得歟！</p>
<p>國民黨自經去歲臨時全國代表大會之决定而取總裁制，黨內外翕然稱頌；誠以權力自此集中。意志自此統一，以組織之强健，　事功之猛進，然時日荏苒，成績之表見無多覯；是無他，戰時以軍事爲主，不遑爲黨致全力，而致力所至，即使成就甚宏，亦爲戰事所掩而非盡人聞知；此由主觀與客觀兩因。當然成績不克如所預期。今後大局入於更嚴重之階段，吾人仍應體認緩急重輕，未宜責備求全。顧在中央委員方面言之，却有不可責己太寬者。原中央委員在黨內之地位，不因總裁制而損其崇高；在黨政或在社會之服務，不因戰時以軍事爲主而貶爲附庸；抑且在恰如其分之自尊觀念上，與天下匹夫之責任觀念上。對黨對國對社會，乃至對所掌職守，應有法式總裁精神，而較一般黨員曁人民，作千百倍其刻苦淬勵之自覺。庶幾總裁爲全國所心悅誠服，奉爲唯一領袖之外，中央委員亦於精神方面之種種，確示一般黨員與人民以不凡；要知任何組織之能維繫不朽，在乎中堅分子形成優良傳統之規模，而不能永永依賴之於任何自然人。國民黨得總裁，而爲之中堅分子之中央委員，則有待奮發者尙多；竊以爲國民黨在政治上之前途，端視黨內中央委員之如何爲黨創建以完成屹立不拔之根基；中堅不如人則前途不如人，所虞在己而不在人。人民屬望於國民黨者獨厚，國民黨亟應有實際事績適應人民厚望之道，此一也。國民黨夙以革命精神，立黨建國，然最近十年，革命精神寢衰矣。有關國政者姑勿論，就黨言之，如規畫黨內之組織，推行實踐黨之主義與政策，制裁黨內一切之黨紀，遴任中央地方各級職員之人選，在在發見革命精神之不澈底；往往轟轟烈烈，以雷霆萬鈞之力，發動於前，卒埋沒於忽明忽昧之中。論情衡事，當然其中必有不得已之苦衷，爲黨內所共諒；然觀感所繫，影響所及，與其事功效能之所不足，則不盡能取諒於人民。究其結癥，事非一格，殊無例舉必耍；然保持廓然大公之態度，芟除不必要之瓜葛與掣肘，將原有之革命精神發揮而光大之，要爲根治之道；此二也。此决抗戰，在國族對內對外之種種方面說明之，無不富有革故鼎新之意義；即如社會之各種事業，與任何個人之立身立業，亦將以抗戰而遭逢嚴重之測騐，發生强烈之變化；此乃趨勢使然，殆難避免；行見優秀者當得合理之發展，腐朽者將受合理之淘汰。若使其間更加以人工，則最後之歸宿雖大體不能違反趨勢，然所造就之過渡現象則必視人工當否而殊觀。針對此項偉大之動態，謀國者應認識明確，因勢而利導之。易辭申言之，務　　加工力，而使一切興革成敗沈浮利鈍，極公道，極經濟，極分明。工力而得當，可以短縮完成建國大業之過程，反之，徒增魔障；此其影響遠大，蓋有不可言語形容者；然登高自卑，行遠自邇，一切發端，即在今茲。是以今茲謀黨謀國，至少必須檢討現實，對人對事之不公道，不經濟，不分明者，務作無情之排除；能作無情之排除，始得合理之辦法；此三也。此三者，五中全會其三致意之乎！</p>

<h3>新近建省的西康　昔視為四陲蠻荒區域　今在抗戰後方負重任</h3>
<p>西康建省、巳於本年元旦實現、昔日視爲西睡蠻荒區域、今實爲西疆局鑰、且在抗戰的後方、負有重任、茲將西康省的大槪情形、報吿如决、</p>
<p>西康爲中國八大高原之一、多高山峻谷、東界四川、南接雲南英屬緬甸和印度、北隣甘肅靑海、西通西藏、總面積的二百零四萬六千方里、而人烟稀少、全省合計、不過三百八十萬零五百人、其中漢族的六十萬人、藏族的一百三十萬人、康族一百七十萬人、其他爲蒙古人等、爲數甚少、</p>
<p>西康是橫斷山脈的崇山峻嶺所包圍着的、所謂橫斷山脈、是由崑崙山脈南支岡噶里山脈分出的色隆拉嶺及伯舒拉嶺、唐古拉山脈分出的他念他翁山脈及雲嶺山脈、巴顏喀喇山脈分出的沙魯里嶺和大雪山脈六大幹綫所構成的、除了這橫斷山脈的六大幹綫以外、還有東南端的岷山、和西南角的無定山、主要的河流、有雅魯藏布江、薄藏布江、恩江、瀾滄江、金沙江、雅礱江、大渡河等、雅魯藏布江源於西藏、流入英屬印度阿薩密境、薄藏布江源出本省嘉黎縣、流入英屬緬甸、怒江發源於拉薩以北高原中、流過本省入雲南、然後再流入緬甸、瀾滄江發源於靑海南邊、經本省入雲南、再入法屬越南、金沙江爲長江上游、介本省巴塘及四川叙府之間、雅礱江卽小金沙江、源於巴顏喀喇山南麓、和大金沙江並行南下、至四川會理之西合大金沙江、大渡河自岷江南麓發源、蜿蜓流貫於川康兩省、西康地屬半熱帶性、略受季風之影響、惜因地勢高峻、氣候不免寒冷、但亦因地而異、如康定拔海甚高、寒威特甚、巴安地勢較低、寒暖適宜、</p>
<p>西康富源、首推礦藏、如瞻化之麥科金礦、素以質佳著名、昌都之煤層、有深至七千尺高六百尺者、寗靜出石油甚旺、英俄人曾往調查、同普、德格、一帶出靑銅黃銅、康定、巴安。一帶產鐵、惜因交通不便、土人又囿於迷信、淸季雖略有開採、數量究竟甚少、農業因地勢高峻、氣候寒冷、未能十分發達、祇能於谿谷窪地、略加墾殖、農產以小麥玉蜀暴、較多、馬鈴薯。豆類次之、稻米則甚少、畜牧以草原廣大、頗爲適宜、以犁牛爲大宗、馬次之、麝香長於雄　臍囊中、產量極登、每年輸出國外、爲數頗鉅、林產亦多、以松。杉。爲主、樅榛决之、西康與西藏壞地相接、原爲藏地喀木之地、惟西康自有其歷史相承之固定區域、决不能和西藏相混合、歷史上西康之名、始見於後漢、諸葛亮征南蠻、曾跑到此地、明末桂王亦被放逐到西康、惟西康自唐朱元明而至淸、治理方法、不過以覊縻之術官其會長、使土人只知有西康不知有中國、淸光緒三十年、英藏條的旣定、淸政府始悟康藏之界不可不亟謀劃淸、治理方法、亦不能徒持屬縻之術、於三十二年設川滇邊務大臣、由趙爾豐任之、趙經營西康、前後凡五六年、力謀建樹、墾荒興學、改土歸流、以爲長治久安之計、規模粗具、而淸廷傾覆、民國成立後、劃川邊卅三縣爲特別區域、至民國七年、藏軍進攻、陷德格。寗靜。等九縣、所餘者僅十三縣、二十年、又爲藏番侵佔甘孜、瞻化。二縣、鹽井半失、巴安亦數瀕於危、直至民國二十一年、川康軍才奪回甘孜·瞻化·德格·白玉·鄧柯·等縣、並於是年十月間、由川康軍總指揮劉文輝和西藏達賴喇嘛各派交涉專員、在德格·崗拖，地方訂立停戰協定、規定金沙江以東由漢方管理、以西由藏方管理、康藏糾紛、雖然吿一段落、但是失陷的地方、尙未完全收複、西康建省之議、傳之甚久，現在總算成立了、關於以後發展的計劃、在西康省政府發表的成立宣言中、業已詳述無遺矣、</p>

<h3>英首相聘義期近　談話範圍廣泛　德義均主開四强會議　討論地中海各項問題</h3>
<p>柏林　當此英國首相張伯倫、卽當聘問義國之際、德國政界人士咸皆希望張伯倫首相動使法國當局允由貢法德議四强舉行會議、討論地中海各項問題、略謂義國爲貫澈其所提各項要求起見、或當在法義兩國屬地毘鄰地帶、引起遭遇戰、然後動員海軍、正未可必、張伯倫首相深恐德國有所舉動、以援助義國、自當勸令法國參加四强會議、似此、德國亦可乘機在會議席上提出殖民地要求云、德國政界人士希望如此、但富有經騐之觀察家則謂法義兩國若果發生嚴重衝突、德國未必用武力援助義國、不寗唯是、德國若果諗知法義之爭、足以引起武裝衝突、其對於義國所提各項要求、或竟拒不充分加以贊助、亦有可能、要之、德國所希望者、厥乃英國在法義兩國之間出面調處、如是而已、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英內閣　下月改組　性質與範圍如何　視外交局勢而定</h3>
<p>倫敦此間政界人士頃宣稱、英國內閣當於下月間改組、共性質與範圍、當視張伯倫首相與義國當局進行談話、結果如何、以爲轉移、換言之、首相倘能勸導義相墨索里尼切實贊助綏靖政策、而在經濟上獲有種種利益以爲交換條件、則急進派人物如前外相艾登之流、卽不致加入內閣、反之、首相此行若果失利、其對於德義兩國亦惟有採取强硬政策、果爾則艾登之重新入閣、自屬毫無疑義、抑內閣若果改組、國防有關各部大臣、無論如何必當有所更調、例如國防調整大臣殷斯基潑殆當去職一也、首相綏靖政策若果失敗、政府或將國民志願服役制、改爲義務性質、屆時自必專設一部、而以主張義務服役制、最烈之陸相倍立厦調任該部大臣二也、此外、海外貿易大臣赫德森指責軍備擴充計劃進行不力、爲人所共知、今後是吾留任、亦當以外交局勢如何演變以爲斷、農業大臣莫理遜之另調他職、允屬意料中事云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎法國總理達拉第於其遄返巴黎途中、路過沃朗奇、曾在該地市政廳發表簡短之演說、申辯彼在慕尼黑協定中所處之地位、並剴切曉諭世界各國、法國並未因此有所分裂、彼在慕尼黑之作爲、一則以保障法國爲懷、一則欲使世界不罹於戰爭之禍、達拉第復鄭重申稱、法人欲求和平、先須團結、因法國內部倘一旦渙散、則勢必爲敵所乘、對於外國各報散言法國行將發生內戰之說、彼亦加以辯正、謂散播此種流言之國家、顯有覬覦法國在地中海及他處地盤之野心、達拉第繼稱、「一俟余回抵巴黎之後、余將傾全力於國事、所傳種種决不容其成爲事實、余相信維持法國以及各屬地之安寗與秩序、乃保護法蘭西共和國及世界民主政治之上策也」、（八日海通電）</p>
<h3>匈捷邊境　局勢依然緊張　捷軍續向安城進攻　匈派遣生力軍增援</h3>
<p>匈京　北部蒙加克城發生事變之後、甫於昨日午後復歸平靜、安格伐爾城附近那基傑的克地方、又復發生嚴重事故、捷克正規軍一隊、又於昨晚九時、會同烏克蘭族游擊隊、向該處進攻、（按安根伐爾城、原名烏慈霍洛德城、乃係捷克喀爾巴阡烏克蘭省省會、經維也納會議决定劃歸匈國者）、匈國當局聞詢、業已派遣生力部隊、前往該處增防（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>匈京　蒙加克城附近局勢依然緊張、按之匈國方面所接獲之消息、捷克軍隊在該處一帶賡續集中、此外、匈國邊界哥爾達鎭（與捷克斯洛伐克省邊界相距不遠）、本日亦曾發生事端、綠該鎭有居民名李彭斯者、因侮辱匈攝政霍爾第上將被捕、民衆一百五十餘人當卽舉行示威運動、表示抗議、匈國憲兵亦卽開槍擊斃三人、一時情形頗爲嚴重云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>匈京　據匈牙利官塲通信社之消息、墨開錫伏附近之克拉斯特羅馬傑方面、昨發現捷克軍隊之新移動、捷克並搬運樑柱與木板等物、顯有在拉泥加河造橋、以便運兵至伐庫洛薩之意云、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>捷京　此間昨發表公報搪稱，捷匈混合委員會現正調查蒙加克衝突事件、昨日午後已舉行第一决會議、捷政府已諭令對於此事之原因與後果、詳加調查、同時並認雙方政府宜乘此機會、以友好合作之精神、研究各種趨勢、以期綏靖邊界、而杜絕此種衝突事件之復作云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>捷京　關於蒙加克城事變、半官方面頃發表公報稱、自昨日午後五時起、該地業已復歸平靜、喀爾巴阡烏克蘭省自治政府已派聯絡員盧嘉史中尉、前往當地襄助捷匈兩國軍官所組成之聯席委員會進行調查云、此外、軍事當局亦就事變經過、發表公報稱、捷匈兩國邊界蒙加克城附近處所、匈牙利國陸軍部隊由武裝人民予以援助、曾於一月六日與捷克陸軍部隊開火、迄至午後、經雙方軍隊聯絡員干涉之後、始乃停止、彼此部隊亦卽沿邊界綫回復原防、捷匈兩國軍官所組成之聯席委員會、業於本日午後調查經過情形、以冀覓獲適當解决方案、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>捷匈糾紛　德感不安　義公然袒匈</h3>

<p>柏林德國半官報政治外交通訊載、德國政府向捷匃兩國發出警吿、並表示德國對蒙加克事件之態度、據稱、任何地方之當局遇有此種事件發生之伊始、卽須使人民平心靜氣、保持常態、並當採取適當之措施，防止同樣事件之發生、該報認爲此屆不幸事伴之禍水、由於各方面人對於最近修改疆域之意見不同、繼續宣傳改變邊界之要求、實際上此種宣傳、不惟違犯莊嚴的官方之保證、並有興風作浪、引起國際衝突之可能、此風决不可長、無論謠言如何傳說、維也納會議之判决已成鐵案、匃捷兩國之新邊旣定、不可越界尋釁矣、（八日海通電）</p>

<h3>上海之金融市塲（一）戰前上海金融界之雄姿</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>上海雄踞全國經濟金融之重鎭，行將百年。不特爲一切新式金融機關之發祥地，亦爲一切新式金融機關之集中點。戰前擁有全國三二·五％家銀行，市內密佈分支行一二八家。合計共達一八一家之多（一）。其中四十二家會員銀行，佔有全國銀行實收股本總額叫五·〇％（二），資產總額三十二億二千萬元，佔全國四四·五％以上（三），庫存現金六億五千二百萬元弱，佔全國五五·〇％（四），各種存款</p>
<p>（註）（一）據中國銀行經濟研究室調查，民廿六年六月底出，全國共有銀行一六四家，上海占五十三家，全國有分支行一六二七家，上海占一二八家。</p>
<p>（二）據廿六年全國銀行年鑑營業統計細表加算而得，全國共有四〇二·六九五·九〇九元，上海會員銀行一七八·五六一·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>（三）同上來源加算而得，全國七·二七五·八五九〇·七五一元，上海三·二一六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>（四）同上來源加算，全國一·〇七一·八〇三·七二六元，上海六五一·九二·〇〇〇兀。</p>
<p>（五）同上來源加算，全國四·五五·一·二六八·九六二元，上海三·四〇九〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>總額三十四億零九百萬元，佔全國且達七六·一％（五），况尙限於四十一家會員銀行之紀錄，若非會員之中央銀行等尙不在內。</p>
<p>錢莊業本爲上海二百餘年前之創作，素爲中國舊式金融機關中之領導，雖自銀行業勃興以來，已屈居其次。但在國內各地，尙佔不可輕侮之潛力在。民廿四年時，全國共有錢莊銀號一一八九家；資本共的七千多萬元。上海之匯劃莊，其時雖巳减剩五十五家；但擁有之資本，則達二千多萬。幾佔全國三分之一以上（六）。</p>
<p>全國共有華商保險公司二十五家，上海獨居二十二家。資本幾佔百分之九十（七）。</p>
<p>上海八百多方公里之租界區域內，擁有華商信託公司十一家。但</p>
<p>（註）（六）據廿四年全國銀行年鑑計算而得，東四省不在內。（九）據張一凡“財政金融大辭典（民廿五年世界書局出版）</p>
<p>全國一千一百十七多萬方公里之版圖中，却僅有二家（八）。</p>
<p>密佈大江南北及鐵路公路沿綫之倉庫堆棧，幾全部以上海之金融資本爲背景。</p>
<p>銀公司，儲蓄會，地產公司，交易所，更以上海爲唯一的活動地盤。甚至最適於封建社會中之古老金融機關，如押典當舖，亦以資本化之上海社會爲最多。戰前全國各大都市及主要城鎭共有押當四六三二家，而上海獨得六六〇家，擁有資本二千萬元弱，而全國僅一億四千多萬元（九）。</p>
<p>列强對華投資，更以上海爲主要對象。一九三一年時投資總額三十二億四千二百萬美元中，在滬者佔三四·三％，計十</p>
<p>一億一千二百萬</p>
<p>（註）（八）東方雜誌卅二卷七期一四二頁表。</p>
<p>（九）據張一凡：財政金融大辭典附錄（民廿五年世界書局出美元（十）。彼等藉此資力，從而建起其控制中國經濟之王座。如英商麥加利，滙豐，有利；法商東方滙理；荷商安達；德商德華；日商正金，三井，三菱等等金融資本，早在中國尙無銀行之前，已相偕來滬活動。麥加利銀行，且在上海開埠不到十年，已移殖其分行於外灘。</p>
<p>因中外資本皆以上海爲策源中心，加以又有揚子江流域之遼闊沃地與豐富物產，爲其活動之背景。上海之一切商業與金融活動，乃能散播其影饗於全國各地，並有支配一切之權戚。如匕海各種交易所價格，莫不爲全國各地市塲變動之樞紐。證券市塲之榮辱，竟能影響國家財政之命運。甚至標金與棉花，竟有影響整個遠東市塲之威力。如是雄姿，早爲世人所共曉。</p>
<p>（註）（十）C·F·Remer，Foreign　Investmentsin　China．</p>
<p>（二）「孤島金融時代一中之今日特色</p>
<p>然自八一三戰事勃發，上海首當其衝，今且淪爲孤島。此觀顯赫不可一世之威力，業巳大爲遜色。</p>
<p>雖由於官商之協力，與措置對應之得宜，業已完成集體安全制度；並受惠於租界區域之特殊關係；各種金融機關，大致尙能偏安一隅，苟延迄今。且有二十九家所屬之一百六十餘所分支行及辦事處，且由附近戰區，遷來滬地，恢復辦公　　。然其所謂辦公，只在整理賬目，辦理善後。並無營業可做。芸芸三百餘萬之市民，難民與準難民恐佔其多數；誠已不配爲其營業上之顧客。况規模愈大之國人金融機關，莫不虛有其表，巳無內囊可言，不特其有如血液與精髓之資產，或被燹火所吞暫維現局，故雖有軀亮，實同虛設。即或不然：則惟有賬面之債權，欺人欺己。猶不禁遙望烽烟四起之淪陷區域，暗自彈淚</p>
<p>（註）（十一）據申報二十七年十一月二十九日載</p>
<p>至於外商，今則僅有準備索取賠償戰事損失之資格，已無繼續其自由進出中國門戶之特權。如美商運通銀行外運之大宗白銀，竟爲某方半途攔回，不得不重藏滬窟：即其一例。</p>
<p>戰前上海金融市塲，人固皆知其有三個集團：即外商銀行，華商銀行，於錢莊。當時互爭雄長，水火不容；今則除日商外，業已處於同一命運。如最近外商銀行，已允收受華商之交換劃頭，不復如過去之與外灘劃頭，嚴分軒輊。又如中外保險商人，今又特設「華洋聯合特務委員會」，合謀當前難局之解决交易所市塲，早已奉命停業，今雖有黑市塲出現；但其作一用，若非消極的只謀其手頭財富之維持，即在被人利用而自掘墳墓。如證券黑市塲之活動，可謂出諸前項目的。烚赤照外滙之非法交易，結果反促成其法幣計値之財產瘦削。天津濟南等之棉價，本受上海紗布交易所價格支配。他如石家莊等地，在中國棉市上更無地位可言。然今日各該地點之棉市，非特巳不受上海之支配，抑且時在支配上海之市塲。是以故：今日上海金融市塲上之一切活動，充其極：僅屬於八百多方公里內之金融活動而已；已不能與戰前之爲一千一百餘萬方公里內之金融活動可比（12），此之謂今日孤島金融市塲之特徵歟？</p>
<p>（註）（12）據申報年鑑所載：全國土地面積爲一千一百餘萬方公里，上海租界區爲八百多方里，此數內尙包括東區在內，實則東區亦非上海金融界得以活動之所矣。</p>
<p>（三）由沉滯而蠢動之孤島金融</p>
<p>自八一三迄今，「孤島金融」之活動，可以本年三月初旬實的投機。</p>
<p>滬戰爆發之前夜，上海正在近數年內罕見之熱烈投機風潮中，紗花等交易所竟累財部派員徹查。甚至勞蔣委員長在　山召集洽老等面詢一切。方用統制手段解決當時糾紛。不久，閘北戰士已起、交易所卽奉命停業，銀錢業於財部公佈安定金融辦法後始得復業。所謂安定金融辦法，不外兩種：一爲限制提取存款；一爲不受限制之商業存款，得行使滙劃票據。此種匯劃票，卽不可兌取法幣，又不能購買外匯，但與法幣之價值完全相同。與戰前代幣性質之匯票，意異其本質。其時對外交通與貿易，卽被日軍隔斷，工商各業皆陷於停頓狀態。後因國軍西撤而尤見凍結。　（未完）</p>
<h3>正規游擊隊奉令作戰東戰塲開始反攻　嘉興平湖間交通斷絕滬日軍逐日開杭增援</h3>
<p>東戰塲華軍游擊隊之整個反攻、現有開始機樣、浙西華軍游擊隊、業已於本月五日起、發動攻擊、目標爲杭州嘉興之日軍重耍軍事據點、日來日軍在滬杭鐵路調遺頻繁、同時京滬路沿錢、亦有戰事、各情如下、</p>
<p>浙西華軍　奉命作戰</p>
<p>華軍正規遊擊隊陸｜軍六十三軍六十三師·六十一師、自克復海鹽縣城、以及海寗東鄉半縣之土地後、在浙西自錢塘江北岸以至滬杭鐵路以南乍浦。瞰浦。等處、已獲有根據地、在該區內、一切秩序、均上軌道、各縣政府亦已成立辦公、協助軍隊辦理政治工作、近該處華軍、以奉第三戰區指揮之作戰命令、乃發動攻擊、於本月五日開始向鐵路錢之嘉興。平湖。兩縣進攻、五六兩日、在嘉平間之九里橋。十里亭地方、與日軍發生接觸、業已將該處之嘉興至平湖公路十餘里之路基、爲華軍加以破壞、是以嘉平間交通斷絕、</p>
<p>平湖日軍　撤退模樣</p>
<p>在滬杭間之日軍重要軍事據點、則爲嘉興、因該處有蘇嘉鐵路、可與京滬鐵路綫聯絡、一面通至平瀾公路而可至滬杭公路之乍浦、除沿海軍艦外、在錢塘江北岸、杭州後方日軍、則全視嘉與爲接濟樞紐、此决嘉平路被華軍切斷後、平湖日軍、已陷孤立、處華軍包圍　中、現平湖日駐軍不過二百名、極易爲華軍殲滅、故平湖縣城、即有克復可能、據平湖來滬之人談、平湖日軍有自圖撤退模樣、城內傀儡機關、均驚慌萬狀、</p>
<p>上海日軍開杭增援</p>
<p>杭州附近戰事開始一節、已誌昨報、嘉與方面之華軍、因係爲策應該處友軍、以爲牽制日軍起見、故由直屬指揮官命令攻擊、實爲華軍整個開始向浙西進攻、至上海日軍方面、已遺派一部份駐軍馳往增援、三日來由上海向杭州開出之火車、均附有日軍、每决三百至五百名不一、估計巳開出在一千名以上、或竟遠過此數、</p>
<p>丹陽常州亦有激戰</p>
<p>又在京滬鐵路沿綫、丹陽。常州附近、亦有戰事、據悉現常州甚爲緊張、城內日軍、巳加緊戒嚴、無錫方面、謠言亦熾、鐵路南北之游擊隊、業已取得聯絡、衆料日內該處將有大規模戰事發生、</p>
<h3>中國政府調整戰時財政　整頓各項稅收推行直接良稅謹慎法幣發行採用發行公債</h3>
<p>中國政府爲調整抗戰時期之財政、竭力整頓各項稅收、推行直接良稅、並採用發行公債之最好辦法、至於法幣之發行、决秉過去謹愼政策辦理、抗戰年餘、增發不滿三萬萬元、現金凖備反見提高，茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>整頓稅收</p>
<p>（一）印花稅、凡舊印花稅率表第一目至第三十五目所定之稅率、一律加倍徵收、貨價或金額原在三元以上起貼、現改爲一元以上起貼、（二）轉口稅、凡在設有海關之處、裝運起卸、或經過有海關或分卡之處、無論由鐵路·公路·輪船·民船·飛機·郵政·運輸之土貨、一律徵收轉口稅、（三）菸酒稅、將各種土酒照舊稅率加征五成、土菸葉稅照舊、惟土菸絲每凈重一百斤征稅二元零七分半、（四）去年七月一日起開征非常時期過分利得稅、並準備征收遺產稅、（五）統稅、將雲南·新疆·西康·靑海·等省改爲施行統稅區域、至於由上海外運谷項應納統稅貨品、改由入境第一道征收機關查騐補征、</p>
<p>發行公債</p>
<p>（一）救國公債五萬萬元、二十六年九月一日發行、年息四厘、三十年還淸（三）國防公債五萬萬元、二十七年五月一日發行、年息六厘、三十年還淸、（三）金公債、甲。關金票爲一萬萬關金、乙。英金票爲一千萬英鎊、丙。美金票爲五千萬美元、二十七年五月一日發行、年息俱爲五厘、十五年還淸、（四）賑濟公債一萬萬元、二十七年七月一日發行、年息四厘、二十年還淸、以上四種、均係抗戰以後所發行之內債、其中賑濟公債、目的在救濟戰區難民、與一般財政支出無關、至於抗戰以後新起之外債、因政府未曾公佈情形、不得而知、其已見於報端者、有中英·中美·中法·中捷·等、</p>
<p>愼發法幣</p>
<p>法幣之發行、觔年七月份中央銀行三萬八千二百七十五萬七千六百十九元、中國銀行五萬一千七百七十二萬二千六百五十九元、交通銀行三萬三千五百九十九萬九千四百四十元、中國農民銀行二萬零八百四十三萬二千零零一元、總計十四萬四千四白九十一萬五千七百十九元、去年之六月、中央銀行四萬八千九百六十六萬六千七百八十五元、中國銀行六萬五千三百二十五萬一千七百二十元、交通銀行三萬二千一百八十五萬力千四百九十五元、中國農民銀行二萬六千二百二十一萬九千八百三十五元、總計十七萬二千六百九十九萬七千八百三十五元、比較增加二萬八千二百零八萬二千一百十六元、</p>
<p>戰時財政</p>
<p>以上述三種戰時財政設施，可知中國抗戰財源、取自增加捐稅者最少、取自發行紙幣者亦不多、其最大財源爲發行公債、况且歷史上之證明發行公債是籌措戰時財政之最好方法、事實證明我財政當局並無以通貨膨脹爲籌措戰時經費之方法、蓋抗戰經年、法幣僅增發二萬餘萬元、况照沘二萬餘萬元之增發法幣、俱有確實準備、因抗戰軍興、全國統一、法幣流通、逐漸推廣、法幣需要、自然增加、淪陷區域人民羣起收藏法幣、同時政府對法幣之發行，特別謹愼、發行現金準備、反較戰前提高、</p>
<h3>出征家屬　應予崇敬　家務困難應代解决</h3>
<p>軍事委員會頒佈優待出征抗敵家屬辦法後、關於出征軍入爲國効命、社會人士、對其家屬自應一致崇敬、地方官公務員更宜優禮相遇、殷勤扶助、茲値天寒歲末、各該縣長以及縣鄉鎮保甲長等、應分別親往、或派員按戶慰問、對其家務困難、應在可能範圍內代謀解决、至各出征軍人家屬、遇有請求恊助之事、無論公事私事、均可向鄉鎮縣府坦率直陳、凡官吏公務員均應竭誠代籌情節較大者、並可逕向區署部申請設法、總之力則容有難周、心則不可不盡、</p>
<h3>軍委會通令　公務員應膽惕勵　以茹苦含辛簡單樸素爲當然　如有陽奉陰違與國人共棄之</h3>
<p>國府軍事委員會，以値此國難嚴重、外侮深入之際、欲貫澈抗戰建國之目的、端賴全國上下、共懷憂患、交相惕勵、衝開艱難前路、完成建國之事功、凡公務人員允應愧痛修省、以身作則、爲民衆樹立楷模、丕變風氣、方母忝於職責、查近來仍有一般公務人員多沿過去不良惡習、奢奢侈浪費、漫不檢束、無論行動起居、仍惟安適是求、毫無薪膽自勵之覺悟、不但予當地軍民、以不良之觀感、今日何時、存亡安危、繫於呼吸、誠一念前錢將士、經歷寒暑、浴血壕墅、被難同胞、廬舍蕩然、流離溝壑、應必食不下咽、寢不安枕、尙何心肝、獨圖安宴、若復自忘責任、罔顧艱虞、是直喪盡廉恥、何顏居於公職、何以領導民衆、完成革命、茲爲整飭紀綱、務希公務人員、咸各激發天良、深切猛省、以茹苦含辛爲當然、一切生活、務循簡單樸素之原則倘仍有言不顧行、或陽奉陰違者、一經查覺、除據情議處外、並當公布事實、以與國人共棄之、而爲玩視危難、毫無血氣者戒、</p>
<h3>經濟侵略手段毒辣　戰區工廠被佔　蘇錫鎭絲廠全由日商經營　戰區內日用物品大量傾銷</h3>
<p>「八一三」戰事發生後、我國實業工廠、大抵毀於砲火、損害最重、迄至目前、多未能恢復開工、日方前曾以經濟合作爲詞、企圖接收華商絲廠、加以統制、當經各廠一致嚴拒、但日方企圖、並不因此中斷、最近江浙兩省戰區內所有大小工廠地基房產、生財機器、均遭日方覇佔、據爲己有、如蘇州·無錫·鎭江各地、</p>
<p>絲廠均由　日商經營</p>
<p>羅致男女工人、照常開工、在鐵蹄蹂躪之下、待遇備極苛酷、所有產出之貨物、則竭力向華中各區大量傾銷、此外關於日用手工業之小工廠、被日方强行接收者更多，如毛巾。肥皂。洋燭。火柴。及烟草等項、戰區內產量殊夥、其間仍用原有廠名出品者、善其名曰中日合辦、究其實際、大權全操日人之手、可見日本對華、</p>
<p>經濟侵略　政策毒辣</p>
<p>之一斑、據曾向戰區中調查者稱、蘇。錫。鎮。三地絲廠、被日方强佔開工者、共有六家、工人的有一萬餘名、被佔地基房產、的達國幣三千萬元、蘇州一地、小工廠被日方刦持及新開設者、不下三十餘家、專事競製日用物品、隨地傾銷、日方此種吸血吮膏之手段、不僅暴露其侵略者之眞面目、且亦適足反證其國內經濟之日暮途窮、不得不採此種陰謀、以苟延其最後之命運、</p>
<h3>猶太難民　來滬暫棲　各人現努力學英語　圖在遠東獲立足地</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、過去數月間猶太難民之抵滬者、已達一千五百名、均由三團體予以照料、供給膳宿零用、且請醫療疾及延敎師敎援英語、該三團體一爲援助上海猶太難民委員會所掌、大半經濟事宜、而實際之救濟工作、則由德奧猶太人救濟協會或救濟歐洲難民國際委員會辦理、前者僅</p>
<p>救濟猶太人　但範圍甚廣、後者則自歐洲獨裁國出亡之任何難民、均予救濟、而此决來滬猶太難民之救濟事宜、允以德奧猶太人救濟協會辦理爲多、該會並與歐洲救濟團體每日電訊往來、如新加坡某救濟團體受該會之託、凡難民搭輪經過、均如照料、並將來滬難民人數、電吿該會、俾豫爲籌備、迨難民抵滬、會方</p>
<p>租私人房屋　使若干難民安居其中、並給予膳費、惟此法浪費過甚、故會方寗取羣居同食制度如目下猶太難民之居於安朋克門大厦（譯音）就餐時、則羣赴四川路靑年會用膳、但會方希望自行供給膳食、則較爲經濟、來滬之猶太難民、太多數爲中等階級、能操英語者極少、此爲一大挫折、故現巳組織上海猶太靑年聯合會敎授英語、該會且設有極重要之</p>
<p>職業介紹部　凡移民之才能等項、均詳加統計、但迄今已爲猶太難民介紹得職業者、僅一百人左右、會方對於工部局之設法限制移民人數、極表同情、因目下上海不能容納許多難民、但難民若已起程來滬、則盡力救濟之、據會方人員之意見、戰事停止後、應爲此輩移民在遠東獲一立足地、而上海則僅爲彼等之暫時憩息地、</p>
<h3>中交海外支行　相繼設立</h3>
<p>中國交通兩銀行、爲活潑西南各省金融、業巳在西南各大埠增設分支行四十餘處、積極辦理工商及農村貸款、頗著成績、爰爲適應對外貿易之發展、中國銀行在英屬緬甸。仰光。卽荷印巴達維亞設立之支行、已開始營業、同時交通銀行亦决定在菲島馬尼刺設立支行、經香港交行行長李道南前往籌備、亦已就緖、據本市銀行界消息、中行兩支行於月內即可成立、交通菲島支行、刻正待該行董事長錢新之由渝返港、核定計劃、在本年春季前、當可實現、各支行業務注重於華僑滙兌及發展國貨對外貿易、前途頗堪重視、</p>
<h3>領券合約延長　行莊遵辦</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業公會奉財政部電、對各行莊向中。中。交。農四行領用法幣之領券合的、姑照原額勉予展期一年，但在此一年期內、如時局平定、債市穩固時、發行行得於兩個月前通知領券行提前結束後、新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、兩業公會對部准領券合的延長一年案、已照錄部原電、飭會員行莊遵照辦理、聞各行莊對於政府體恤商艱、准予延長一年、表示感戴、</p>
<h3>政府促進農村手工業　訂定五大方針　動員廣大農村農民增强抗戰經濟基礎</h3>
<p>國民政府對於抗戰期間一般工業建設之運行不遺餘力除蠶絲。化學。水電。紡織等各項重要工業外、以我國農村手工業、具有特長、茍能加以指導改良、必可增加生產、足以輔助機械工業之不足、現政府對促進農村手工業、决秉下列方針、積極進行、第一、從技術上積極加以改良、以增加生產、適應抗戰期間農村需要、第二、在各縣城鎮設立小型鐵木廠、以供應各項生產工具、第三、關於農村手工業、着由農本局儘量施放貸款、以利發展、第四、扶導組織農村手工業合作社，調整產銷第五、農村手工業生產簡易，决動員廣大農村農民、一致參加生產、以加强抗戰建國之經濟基礎、</p>

<h3>猶太難民來滬　工部局未限制　日報所載完全無稽　惟對此事相當焦慮</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日本傳來消息、謂公</p>
<p>共租界工部局曾請駐滬日領署</p>
<p>採取若于辦法、俾制止猶太移</p>
<p>民擁入公共租界之說、昨（七日</p>
<p>）由工部局發言人加以否認、按</p>
<p>是項消息，係刋於東京出版之</p>
<p>一月一日英文日本時報、該報</p>
<p>並加評論曰、日本今對華作戰</p>
<p>中、當然不願見</p>
<p>政治難民</p>
<p>羣入日本、</p>
<p>「滿洲國」、</p>
<p>或華北。及華中、日本目不欲被</p>
<p>英國利用在遠　作排猶述動之</p>
<p>工具云云、昨據報吿、是項消息</p>
<p>、絕對無稽、據工部局發言人表</p>
<p>示、工部局對於現時德國移民</p>
<p>擁入公共租界、頗重視之、但局</p>
<p>方僅曾以限制之可能性通知本</p>
<p>埠領事團、日本時報此决所載、</p>
<p>晤示工部局防杜移民賡續來滬</p>
<p>之消息、並非仞次、但前此之消</p>
<p>息、</p>
<p>亦屬無稽</p>
<p>工部局對於</p>
<p>本埠外國移</p>
<p>民問題之過分擴大、致無法辦</p>
<p>理一節、當然焦慮無疑、但目下</p>
<p>亦無可如何、由德國亡命來滬</p>
<p>者、巳達一千五百人左右、預料</p>
<p>由意國駛滬之維多利亞號輪、</p>
<p>本月十五日抵埠、復將載猶太</p>

<p>問題時語記者云</p>
<p>募九萬元</p>
<p>給養費、確</p>

<p>之問題、而供給此款項、乃外國</p>
<p>政府之實任、該發言人並稱、會</p>
<p>方業已從事得此資助之努力云</p>
<p>、同時探悉、本埠對於防杜移民</p>
<p>羣之繼續來滬、實無能爲力蓋</p>
<p>上海各方均無權可令移民離滬</p>
<p>、在德國排猶潮中逃亡之猶太</p>
<p>人、對於若輩之行止、果須加以</p>
<p>任何統制</p>
<p>者、則應由</p>
<p>此輩移民登</p>
<p>輪地之國家爲之而移民之登輪</p>
<p>地、大半均在意國、如意政府欲</p>
<p>合作辦理此事、則意國各輪船</p>
<p>公司之國內辦公處、對於指定</p>
<p>上海爲其目的地之移民、可拒</p>
<p>不售票、若他國亦予以合作、可</p>
<p>同樣實行統制、但是吾曾作獲</p>

<h3>經濟設立　大規模煉鐵廠　購備高熱積極開練　每日榮鐵十噸鐵價不致再漲</h3>
<p>鐵爲輕重工業主要原料、</p>
<p>中國產鐵雖豐、惟以尙無</p>
<p>高熱度溶鐵爐、故熟鐵產</p>
<p>量未能普遍供給、在漢口</p>
<p>未淪陷前、各地需要生鐵、</p>
<p>大都由漢口六河溝生鐵公</p>
<p>司供給、自武漢放棄後、生</p>
<p>鐵來源、頓感缺乏、因此鐵</p>
<p>價飛漲、每噸已由三百餘</p>
<p>元、漲至七百餘元、茲悉經</p>
<p>濟部工礦調整處、現已在</p>
<p>川設立煉鐵廠、購備每日</p>
<p>溶化十噸高熟度溶爐一座</p>
<p>、其生鐵在武漢放棄前、已</p>
<p>設法運出一千餘噸、同時</p>
<p>積極籌劃開發鐵礦、故嗣</p>
<p>後民間所需熟鐵、可無缺</p>
<p>乏之虞、鐵價亦可不致再</p>
<p>漲、</p>

<p>採納各方意見、及甬防守副司</p>
<p>令章桂齡之建議、曾有詳細討</p>
<p>論日內即可頒布施行、至滬甬</p>
<p>直接及兼灣航輪停駛後，滬甬</p>
<p>間貨物、已由航業界實施貨物</p>
<p>聯運、以資調劑、乘客聯運、因</p>
<p>滬台台甬間航班未能相互啣接</p>

<p>可望實現、</p>

<h3>中國戰時經濟之建設　—二十七年末之淸結—</h3>
<p>— 盛慕傑</p>
<p>（一）三原则與八綱領</p>
<p>戰時經濟建設之最大目標，厥爲獲得勝利。然經濟現象，經緯萬端，不有原則以爲指針，何從進行，故中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會宣言中曾就三民主義之最高指導原理，闡述抗戰與建國之關係，相資相輔：而於民生主義中更痛論日本侵略之最大目的，實爲憑藉軍事力量以施行經濟掠奪，故中國在抗戰期問，首宜謀農村經濟之維持，以謀生產力之發展；其决新與工業直接間接關係抗戰之經濟力量，至深且餌，必須全政府與全人民之力量，力謀復與。從有揭舉三原則：第一，以極端之節的與刻苦，以從事於生產的資本之累積與產業之振興；第二，一切產業復與之計劃當集中於求抗戰之勝利，泯除平日因其地位或其職業利害感情之不同，向共同之目的而邁進；第三，經濟之建設，政府必當根據民生主義之信條，施行計劃經濟：凡事業之宜於國營者，由國家籌集資本，從事興辦，務使之趨於生產合理化；其宜於私人企業者，由私人出資舉辦，在國家整理計劃之下，受政府之指導及獎勵。</p>
<p>但求抗戰必勝，建國必成，更制定抗戰建國綱領七類，其中關於經濟者更分八種：第一，經濟建設，以軍事爲中心，同時注意改善人民生活，本此目的，以實行計劃經濟，獎勵海內外人民投資，擴大戰時生產；第二，以全力發展農村經濟，獎勵合作，調節糧食，並開墾荒地，疎通水利；第三，開發礦產，樹立重工業之基礎，鼓勵輕工業之經營，並發展各地之手工業；第四，推行戰時稅制，澈底改革財務行政；第五，統制銀行業務，從而調整工商業之活動；第六，鞏固法幣，統制外滙，管理進出口貨以求安定金融；第七，整理交通系枕，舉辦水陸空聯運，增築鐵路。公路，加闢航錢；第八，嚴禁奸商壟斷居奇投機操縱，實施物品平價制度。</p>
<p>一年以來，中國經濟建設之動機，無不吻合此三原則，而經濟建設之事項，亦無不遵循此八綱領，爰就其重要各項，分別論述，以供關心戰時中國經濟者之參考與研討。</p>
<p>（二）財政上之建設</p>
<p>近年以來，中國財政建設已有顯著之進步。二十五年十月起創該之所得稅，已爲戰時財政添一重要源泉。自八一三中日戰爭正式發動後，國民政府爲鼓勵救國捐輸起見，發行救國公債五萬萬元，十足發行，現巳銷罄。同時先後公佈「非常時期徵收印花稅暫行辦法」九條與「士酒加徵與舉辦土菸絲稅辦法」五條，及「出口及轉口稅則暫行章程」七條施行。惟是戰區日益擴大。向爲稅收中大宗之　關鹽統三稅，所能徵收者實已無幾，例如關稅，據社會經濟月報估計保全口岸二十七年稅收的計八千萬元。在政府方面，勢須另籌財源以資挹注，籌款之法，不外加稅或舉辦新稅，募集內外債，加發紙幣三端。以加稅論，向爲徵取賦稅之所在地，泰半變成戰區，稅已無從收起，遑論加徵。以增發紙幣而論，適足以造成通貨膨脹之弊，紊亂戰時金融，莫此爲甚。是故應付此浩大之戰時支出，其所能資爲挹注而免負担之不平者，厥惟舉辦新稅與募集國債而已。</p>
<p>（甲）關於舉辦新稅者</p>
<p>二十七年十月二十八日國府公佈「非常時期過分利得稅條例一十七條，規定：　凡公司商號行棧工廠或個人資本在二千元以上之營利事業，官商合辦之營利事業，及一時營利事業，其利得超過資本額百分之十五者；　財產租賃之利得，超過其財產價格百分之十二者。各級稅率自百分之十至百分之五十：以二十七年七月一日爲起徵日期，每半年微收一决，但依各業性質，保按月或一决徵收。在十月六日，國府公佈「遺產稅暫行條例」二十四條，規定凡人於死亡時，在中華民國領士內遺有財產，及中華民國人民在本國領土內有住所，而在國外有遺產者，均應微稅。所謂遺產者，即被繼承人之動產不動產及其他一切有財產價值之權利。自遺產總額在五千元以上者起徵，稅類自百分之一至百分之五十，定於二十八年一月一日起實行。</p>
<p>（乙）發行公債</p>
<p>舉辦新稅，固爲戰時財政之根本大計，但新稅之成效難期，故於抗戰財政，殊有緩不濟急之感。况當對內對外，在在需款孔急之秋，益以抗戰經濟之建設，又無不需用資金。是以除主辦新稅之外，不得不藉發行公債以資挹注。自中日戰爭發生以來，所舉借之國債，計國幣十萬零四千七百萬元，關金一萬萬元，外幣一萬五千萬法郎，英金一千零十四萬叫千鎊，美金五千萬元，試觀下表所列：</p>
<p>地方財政除發行公債外，對於稅收之整頓，稅率之增高與稅源之增闢，政費支出之節的，無不努力以赴。茲就廣西省財政設施以觀，則對於各省財政情形，不難舉一反三也。</p>
<p>關於省財政者，按國省稅性質分別調整稅收，在未調整以前暫行照舊辦理；擴充省縣公營事業，使營業收入成爲政府重要財源。，整理土地籌辦土地稅；舉辦城區地價稅：繼續推行房屋稅，省縣各種稅捐，均以直接徵收爲原則，逐漸廢除代徵及包商制；行政機關以不兼徵　稅款爲原則，逐漸將省縣稅捐撥歸稅捐稽徵局辦理；酌提菸酒費稅附加及營業稅，撥充縣地方經費，並定其分配標準；限制各種稅捐之附加，或以其他名目重行徵稅及比例派捐；制定由銀行代理縣金庫章則，逐漸出銀行代理縣金庫。關於縣財政者：責成各縣督促區鄕（鎭）村（街）切實協助稅收機關執行職務；督促各縣繼續調查未納賦稅之土地，按其地價酌收捐費；督促各縣健全縣財監，統一基層組織之收支及保管事務。關於會計審計者：厲行會計制度；實行鄕村預算及會計；嚴密執行事前事後審計；推行就地審計；積極推行稽察事務；並注重各機關財產之普查。</p>
<p>（三）貨幣金融之建設</p>
<p>中國在二十四年冬施行法幣之後，幣制統一，金融穩固。惟是兩廣因政局關係，雲南省因地理關係，法幣尚未能推行。其後二十五年八月二十一日與二十六年六月二十日二次改革廣東幣制取消毫券，而雲桂兩省幣制仍未能統一，推行法幣，然自戰事發生之後，中央政治經濟力量移入西南各省，雲桂幣制亦告統一。於是中國整個幣制因戰事而愈形統一矣。</p>
<p>在金融方面之建設戰爭初起，即有安定金融辦法之公布與安定金副袖充辦法之核准，以及中中交農四行聯合辦事處之組織與四行貼放委員會之設立。二十七年三月以迄六月爲止，先後有進出口外滙統制與改善地方金融機構辦法大綱之施行，以及漢口金融會議决議各項辦法。</p>
<p>（甲）廣西推行法幣</p>
<p>當施行法幣之時，現毫禁止行使，廣西銀行遂乘機收兌，益以省府歲入不敷，在該行透支甚鉅，發行數額竟達二千餘萬元，而尙供不應求。二十五年　軍用浩繁，增發三千餘萬。桂幣價值在跌不已。所幸不久告成，省府迭請中央救濟，終以桂幣與法幣之比價高跌爭執，迄無結果。二十六年中日戰事旣興，法定桂鈔兩元合法幣一元，同時中央政府爲整理廣西金融充實桂鈔準備起見，於十二月發行整理公債一千七百萬元。</p>
<p>（乙）雲南推行法幣</p>
<p>雲南省遲至二十六年五月方始推行法幣，滇省境內完納收付一切公私款項，概以法幣爲準，不得行使現金；　行使法幣以中央·中國·交通三銀行紙幣單位較小之一元以下小票爲限，富滇銀行新舊紙幣一律行使　凡持銀幣　銀者，限自五月十五日起三個月內向富滇新銀行及分行辦事處各法幣兌換所兌換。廿七年財部妥訂前富滇銀行發行之美印紙幣收燬辦法，限自九月一日至十一月底止，一决收回結束，惟因交通不便，特延期三個月至二十八年二月底止，由富滇新銀行辦理結束，逾期作廢。</p>
<p>「丙」統制外匯之設施</p>
<p>自安定余融辦法公佈後，農商工礦各業所需資金，仍應維持供應。惟余融業爲應付提有起見，均原自凖備，堅縮放款。中國中央儲備銀行雖未成立，然過去對金融恐慌盡救濟之職責者，均爲四政府銀行，故財部乃令四行辦理貼放。同時安定金融補充辦法雖暫時阻止資金外流，但機構殘缺，未能普遍收效，必需管理貿易，統制外滙。二十七年三月北平所謂一聯合準備銀行」成立，發行無担保不兌現紙幣後，中國爲保障外匯基余起見，同年三月十四日發生公債仍為主要之手段，然此未足為中國戰時財政之疵點，徵諸歐戰時各國財政之措施，蓋有足稱矣。</p>
<p>（丙）關於地方財政者</p>
<p>至於地方財政，平時本甚支絀，戰時允茶。財政上彌補之方法，除有省銀行者可透支若干外，其他亦不得不乞靈於公債政策。吾人確知已經發行者約爲六千萬元。茲列表如决。。公佈外滙請核辦法三條購買外滙請核規則六條，其後迭有增進，四月十二日令上海通訊處成立，四月十四日令提供現金，五月七日令銀行申請外滙應記明進口商名稱金額，與申請銀行祇准取十六份之三便士手績費，六月十日令外滙申請書中需詳記品名數量額產地等項目，八月八日起更進爲定貨核准制。中央銀行僅有外滙賣出，而無買入，究屬非策，且放任出口外滙於市塲活動，影響於滙價前途者亦鉅，理宜集中於中央銀行，旣以滋生外滙頭寸，兼以穩定法幣滙價，故在四月二十五日父有統制出口外滙各項辦法之施行。主要辦法共有條例四種：　商人運貨出口及售結外滙辦法，　出口貨物應結外滙之種類及其辦法，　關係機關稽查出口貨產外滙注意事項，　實施一出口貨物應結外滙之種類及其辦法」注意事項。規定出口貨物應將所得外幣售與中國或交通銀行——事實上中交兩行再轉售給中央銀行。應售結外滙出口貨物逐漸擴充爲二十四種，後改爲二十三類，以後更有刪减，自二十八年元旦起更减爲桐油·猪鬃·牛皮·茶菓·礦砂·五倍子·皮貨·藥村·羊毛·蠶絲·苧蔴·腸衣·鴨毛等十三大類。</p>
<p>「丁」改善地方金融辦法大綱</p>
<p>四行聯合貼放，固足以增强中央及特許銀行領導金融調劑工商之實力，惟是地方金融機關之機構急待改善，資力更需充買，故四月末財部公佈改善地方余融機構辦法大綱十條，特准各地方金融機關得向中中交農四行領用一元券與輔幣券，但以辦理下列與農工礦有關之業務爲條件：　農產品倉庫之經營，　農件品之儲押，　種子肥料耕牛農具之貸款，　農田水利事業之貸款，　農業票據之承受或貼現，　完成合法手續及有繼續收益之土地房產抵押，　工廠廠產之抵押，　工業原料及製成品之抵押，　商業票據之承受或貼現，　公司債之經理發行或抵押，　　照章發息之公司股票之抵押，　　農林漁礦業出品及日用國貨商品之抵押。是項領券辦法之用意，純在鼓勵余融機關向農工礦方面邁進，以矯正往昔偏重商業之失，更欲使資金悉數流入農村，盡用於生產之途，關於農業方面者佔五項之多。戰時安定金融辦法乃消極的限制，地方金融改革綱要則爲積極的建設矣。</p>
<p>「戊」黃金政策之進展</p>
<p>中國戰時貨幣余融上之建設，除前述者外，尚有黃金政策之進展，英美借款之成立與中美貨幣之延期，共重要性亦殊未可忽視。</p>
<p>自二十四年中國白銀收歸國有之後，對於黃金買賣仍仟其自由，僅用海關金結價以統制金價。惟黃金具有國際幣材之資格。黃金保有量愈多，相對的顯示該國對外購買力之雄厚。自抗戰以來，中國收集黃金亦爲戰時經濟重要政策之一，當救國公債募集時即規定可以用黃金或金類購債。二十六年十月十日公佈金類兌換法幣辦法與施行細則，規定以生金，金器等兌換法幣者給以百分之三——五之手續費，　救國公債者加給百分之六，作爲法幣有款者加給週息二厘。二十七年五月一日發行金公債，規定以生金及其製成品或金幣等類繳購者，按其所含純金數量依關金單位每一關金爲純金六〇·一八六六公毫折合，即以關金債票發給。二十七年十一月一日公佈監督銀樓業收兌金類辦法，規定銀樓業收進或售出赤金及九成金原金等概以具有飾物器具之形狀者爲限　金條塊葉，沙金，礦金，一槪不准收售，專以收買沙余礦金之店舖不兼營銀樓業者，應向中央銀行接洽訂立承受委託代收金類合同，悉數轉售中央銀行不得私自出售。在二　七年十一月中財部限制私運黃金出口及運往淪陷區，規定黃金及任何形狀之金飾，除經財部給照特准者外，一律禁止　運出　，或運往淪陷區域。總觀戰時黃金政策之進展，最大之目的厥爲收集民間金類以增厚外匯基金，蓋中國爲加强法幣對外滙　之鞏固起見，不得不極力設法收集民間金類也。</p>
<p>「己」中美貨幣恊定延期與信用借款</p>
<p>舉借外債，亦爲戰時鞏固幣值安定金融重要政策之一。中國於二十七年九月遣派經濟使節陳光甫席德懋一行赴美，閱時三月，與美財部及私人團體商談之結果，貨幣協定延長有效期間，幷成立二千五百萬美元信用借款。據哈瓦斯十二月十九日電，美財長談話謂中美兩國前於一九三九年七月九日所成立之貨幣協定，中國得以存美之黃金作爲担保品，而自美國獲取信用放款，中國中央銀行曾在保障中美兩國利益之某種條件下，取獲此種信用放款，以便利滙兌之穩定，此項協定至一九三八年底止滿期後，仍當賡繼有效。按一九三七年七月九日中美財長對中美金銀互換協定，共同宜言曾謂：繼續一九三六年五月所訂白銀貨幣協定，在相互可能接受條件下，中國向美購買大量黃金，美國爲協助中國增加黃金準備起見，續向中國購銀；並擦將雙方商定辦法—即中國中央銀行可在保障雙方互利條件下獲得美滙以安定通貨一點，予以擴大。是故貨幣協定與信用借款，殆即擴大商定辦法之結果也。影響所及，愈形加强法幣價傎之穩固。蓋銀價漲跌無常，並無世界通貨之資格，而各種現雖均巳停止金本位制，但黃金在國際金融關係中仍維持價值儲藏之職能，中美貨幣協定延長，常能給予中國白銀易爲黃金之種種便益，以增强法幣外滙基金之價值。其次，信用借款無論其爲貨幣抑或貨物，均能直接間接增加外滙基金，而使法幣價值穩定。</p>
<p>除美國二千五百萬美元之信用惜款外，英國在原則上亦允許一千萬錢之信用放款貸予中國，第一次所據付者爲五十萬鎊，專作購置載重汽車與運輸村料之用。</p>
<p>（四）其他經濟建設　「甲」交通上之建設</p>
<p>今日西南北諸省，巳成中國「抗戰必勝，建國必成」之根據地，以是中國戰時經濟建設亦均集中於西南北諸省。但經濟建設中首重在財政貨幣金融之建設，利用之以推動其他之經濟建設，决爲交通經濟之建設，蓋交通路綫開闢後，「抗戰建國一及經濟建設所需之物資，始得充實，而供給不虞其缺乏。</p>
<p>在交通上之建設，可分公路與鐵道兩方面。關於公路者：有西南公路網，由湖南省以通達貴州四川雲南兩廣等省及緬甸之公路綫，有西北公路網，由湖北省以通達河南陝西甘肅新疆等省之公路綫；有西南北溝通公路網由四川省以通達陝甘之公路綫。關於鐵道者：在西南建造黔滇（貴陽至昆明），　滇（叙府至昆明），滇緬（昆明至中緬邊界之蠻允鎮及緬甸之八莫）三鐵道，允以滇緬鐵路之建築，對於打通歐洲國際交通有重大意義，可以節省西南諸省與國外交通之行程與時日也。</p>
<p>「乙」農礦工商之建設</p>
<p>在抗戰發動後，對於國內經濟之開發，力事調整，允注重於與國防有關係者。二十六年十二月二十二日國府公布戰時農礦工商管理條例，而由軍事委員會依此項條例管理。幷於軍事委員之下設立貿易調整委員會，基金二千萬元；農產調整委員會，基金三千萬元，工礦調整委員會，基金一千萬兀，均山財部特撥抵充。一年半來，成續斐然。</p>
<p>貿易會現隸財部，改稱貿易委員會，以促進土貨外銷爲主務，與出口外匯統制相輔而行。例如湘皖浙贛之茶葉，江浙蜀之蠶絲，蜀鄂蘇之猪鬃皮毛，湘鄂蜀之桐油等產物。二十七年六月中財部更訂定促進出口貿易辦法，分：（甲）减輕出口成本，以促進出口外銷；（乙）調整土貨巿價，以維護國內生產。蓋甲部份則因國際巿塲不振，貨價下落，以致經營出口商人偶受滯銷損失，轉而影響生產事業，而定之補救辦法；乙部份則因法定匯率與黑巿發生差異，商人要求隨巿價售給外匯，或由政府以現金補償，而定之補救辦法也。</p>
<p>農產調整委員會現隸經濟部，由農本局與農業試騐所兩機關與之相輔而行，農本局專司辦理資金之貸放，農騐所專司改良農產之技術。此外經　部訂有補助各省農業改進經費辦法，除合作事業外，凡農業改進機關改進經費可依本法請求補助。財經兩部訂有擴大農村貸款範圍辦法六條，規定凡依照改善地方金融構辦法綱要領用一元劵與輔幣券之金融機關，及依法成立之合作金庫，對增加農業各種放款，應盡量利用各種合作社，但在抗戰期間，凡經放款機關承認之農民組織，亦得爲貸款對象。</p>
<p>工礦調整委員會現亦隸經濟部，與資源委員會分工合作，爲謀公私企業基礎之鞏固。前者協助各地民營工廠由戰區遷往安全地帶，繼續營運，計經政府協助遷往內地各省者有三百數十家，其中一百餘家在四川省。後者專司在內地各省國營各種重工業——鋼鐵化學電力機械以及礦冶之類，例如經濟部協助某機關建設一規模較大之鋼鐵廠，今年夏間竣工後，每日可出相當鋼鐵，又協助某民營製造鋼鐵廠，不日即可出產；，化學工業之硫酸硝酸阿比尼亞等的請辦理此項工業素有經騐之永利公司出力辦理，此外國府在二十七年六月七日公布工業獎勵法，特種工業保息及補助條例，由經濟部核辦之。前者規定在國內外市塲有國際競爭者，採用外國最新方法裝造者，與享有專利權之製造者，得請求减低或免除　出口稅　原料稅　國營交通事業之運費，與　給予獎命　一定區域內五年之專製權。後者規定製造原動力機，電機，工作機器，金屬材料，液體燃料，運輸器材等之特種工業，得請求保息，——實收資本五厘，債票六厘，以七年爲限，或補助——以各品類每年生產費及市價爲標準，酌量給予現金。</p>
<p>總之，戰時農礦工商之建設，由經財兩部主持之，而由三委員會推動之，益以部屬機關輔助之。惟因此項建設，發動於「抗戰必勝，建國必成，」關係機密，情報簡闕，以致不能詳加闡述，是可憾耳？</p>
<h3>外滙套息與資金逃避</h3>
<p>— 應永生</p>
<p>一何謂外匯套息</p>
<p>上海外匯行市，向有近期遠期之分。而近期遠期之市價，因市面關係，發生差數，有時近期比遠期高，有時近期較遠期低。近來市面大都近賤遠貴，即本月份之價比下月份之價低。若買進本月份期貨，同時賣出下月份期貨，即發生一筆差額，此差額，即利息；利息之高低隨差額之大小而定，其辦法，與從前之公債套息相仿。</p>
<p>二，套息利率之計算方法</p>
<p>關於套息計算利率之方法，有普通算法與簡易算法兩種，茲分別述之於後：</p>
<p>英金套息之利率計算方法：</p>
<p>（一）普通算法：例如十二月二十四日上午外匯暗市開盤，英金十二月份價八辨士五九三七五，與二十八年一月份價八辨士五六二五，欲投資一萬鎊，能合月息幾釐？</p>
<p>十二月份應交出國幣</p>
<p>即台月息三　餘</p>
<p>普通算法與簡易算法原　一樣，其所求得之利率，大數相同，其尾數因英金合國幣之尾數有五捨六入之關係，略有差異。</p>
<p>美金套息之利率計算方法：</p>
<p>例如二十七年六月二十三日外匯暗市六月份價十八元，</p>
<p>七月份價十七元半，能合月息幾釐，</p>
<p>（以美金十萬兀計）</p>
<p>（一）普通算法：</p>
<p>六月份應交出國幣</p>
<p>差額15，873.02，即　555，555.55一個月之利息，欲求合月息幾釐，</p>
<p>將　15，873.02×1，000（月利率）+　555，555.55=28.5714362</p>
<p>即合月息二分八釐餘</p>
<p>（二）簡易算法：</p>
<p>六月份與七月份行市差數爲.50，七月份行市爲17.5，其算式如後</p>
<p>.50+17.5×1，00=28.57142857</p>
<p>即合月息二分八釐餘，</p>
<p>以上兩法所求得之利率，大數相同，其尾數因美金合國幣之尾數有五捨六入之關係，略有差異。</p>
<p>附注　以上所求得之利率，關於經紀人之佣金均未扣除，依銀行例需付售出外滙部份收人國幣之三十二分之一％，買入外滙部份，不付佣金。</p>
<p>三、最近半年來美金套息　利率高低之比較</p>
<p>茲爲比較上海半年來套息利率之高低起見，特　美金套息最近六個月中每日之比較可以代表之日，（因每個月中各日套息因差額大小高低不一）分列於後，以觀變動之大概。</p>
<p>四、利率高低與資金逃避之關係</p>
<p>資金逃避一事，大都係國人將款項存入外商銀行或買外滙，但套息利率之高低，影響資金逃避亦鉅。因套息利厚而吸收國人經營外滙套息交易。且一般不懂套息爲何物者，受報紙之宣傳套息利率之優厚，亦相繼加入焉。如十月份，因套息利率可扯月息二分左右，做套息交易者，格外踴躣。據中中交三行報告，十月份一月中直接間接流入外商銀行款項，數逾千萬元。但近兩月來因套息所扯之利率，日益低落，國人不願再做此項交易，將款項收回，轉存華商銀行生息，爲數頗鉅，的計在數百萬元，可云逃避資金已收回一部。查外滙套息之主動者，大都係外商銀行，彼因頭寸關係，而定差額之大小，並大部份於成單上批明，此項外滙需存於該行，不計利息，故外滙套息可謂外商銀行向國人吸收之信用借款是也。依現在市面情形而論，若套息所扯之利率高，資余逃避必多：利率低，巳逃避之資金，自然收回。關於資金之逃避，影響市面頗大，旦滙劃貼現之暗盤行市漲跌，亦連帶發生關係。總而言之，外滙套息與資金逃避，實甚密切也。</p>

<h3>談話　寫給上海婦女</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>可敬的上海婦女同胞</p>
<p>你們住在上海，一切行動，雖不十分自由，但對於社會服務，巳有相當的成續。</p>
<p>在過去十八個月中，你們曾在難民收容所裹敎育難民；你們曾舉行過救難遊藝會，籌款救濟難民：你們曾在街頭路邊，爲難民募捐：你們會將自己穿的衣服，贈給難民。最近推行節的救難，你們更能熱烈的贊助。的確，你們已經盡了國民一份子的責任了。</p>
<p>現在我要對你們說的，並不是表揚你們過去的成續，是希望你們今後更進一步的爲人羣謀幸福。下列幾點，想你們當能完全做到。</p>
<p>一、實行節衣縮食最近有一位王國秀女士，從美國回來，據她說，美國有幾個大城市裹的婦女都改穿綫襪。還有幾個城市的婦女，參加一碗飯運動，成續很爲圓滿。本來美國婦女是穿絲襪的，美國社會是很富足的，他們爲什麼要穿綫襪？爲什麼只吃一碗飯，餓着肚皮呢？他們眞是世界上被難人民的同情者，尤其是道種節衣縮食的美德，更值得我們仿傚實行。希望上海的婦女同胞，能够做到這一點。</p>
<p>二、組織讀書會的幾個鄰居，同學或親戚，組織一個讀書會，這是很有意義的活動。各人買幾本新出版的書報雜誌，放在一起，輸流借閱。到開會的時候互相提出報告，同時討論與閱讀有關的各項問題，如敎育問題，社會問題，時事問題等。我以爲做現代的婦女，應有這種讀書的興趣。讀書會，是婦女們最榮譽的團體活動，希望你們趕快的組織起來。</p>
<p>三、組織遠定會　上海的婦女同胞，多不注意身體的健康，對於遠足會的組織，更少舉行。婦女遠足會，在歐美各國早已風行一時，所以他們的身體，耍比你們强健得多。這種組織很簡單，只要的定幾個人，規定每次遠足的方法，如跑路，乘脚踏車，就可以舉行。遠足的途經，不妨暫以僻靜的馬　爲範圍。這是輕而易行的健身活動，我希望在不久的將來，上海婦女界能有這種團體發現。</p>
<p>四、不作無謂消遣聽說上海有極少數的婦女，喜歡打牌。爲什麼喜歡打牌？我　在想不出道理。像這種無謂的消遺，旣廢光陰與精神，又誤家事，實有改進的必要。你們想，終日坐在牌桌邊，家中事務交給娘姨處理；小孩子放到里弄裹遊戲。這種不負家庭責任的生活，如果長此下去，結果，必致家庭崩潰。家庭是國家的基礎組織，家庭崩潰了，怎麼能够產生健全的國家呢！希望你們特別注意取締禁止！</p>
<p>此外如樂用國貨，實行家庭儲蓄等，想你們已經做，不再說了。</p>
<h3>新年救難開篇</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>荏苒流光歲又史，今朝重見一番新，孤島上點綴新年多熱鬧，賞心樂事慶良辰，有的是：重裘雅敘圍爐飲，有的是：陋習還把賭　興，喝雉呼盧猶未足，紅樓妝閣去尋春，處處淸歌聲宛轉，方方妙舞影娉婷，追歡尋樂知多少？可念及困苦流離衆難民！他們是：身乏寒衣頻抖顫，更兼那：腹中飢餓少羹吞，無衣無食眞堪憫，想念鄉關淚暗淋，個個有家歸不得，獸軍在暴恨難平！最可憐：難童弱質怎禁催殘苦，正彷彿：嬌蕊橫遭風雨侵，一樣同胞殊苦樂，他邦猶有表同淸，惻隱之心皆宜有，己飽已溺始稱仁，勸君快把仁囊解，踴躍輸將不厭頻，同來救難莫因循。</p>
<h3>難民與大眾</h3>
<p>— 難記者</p>
<p>在這苦難的時代，大家都是難民：</p>
<p>有的是有衣有食的難民，有的是無衣無食的雞民。我們希望：有衣有食的難民，節省一些下來，救濟無衣無食的難民！我們也希望：無衣無食的難民，努力起來，聯成有食的難民！</p>
<p>管理難民收容所的，要辦到沒有難民可以管理。</p>
<p>做難民救濟事業的，耍辦到沒有難民需要救濟。我們的目的，要把無衣無食的難民，訓練他們，養育他們，成爲有用有力的大衆！</p>
<p>所以我們的周刋，呌做「大衆週刊」。</p>
<h3>難民自給收容所巡禮（下）</h3>
<p>— 以信</p>
<p>（三）第三自給所在愛文義路戈登路口現已解散。</p>
<p>（四）第四自給所：原稱膠州收容所在北京路江西路口該所的組織，分總務，訓導，管理三股。總務股分一，文書，二，給養，三，保管，四，會計四組；訓導股分一，登記，二，衛生，三，警衛三組：管理股分一，班敎，二，統計二組。該所自給的難胞，共計二百四十四人，有職業與無職業的，各佔半數。除工作人員同受敎育的兒童，山該所供給飯食外，共餘的難胞都向該所購飯，每升一百文，購量不加限制，成人每月出五分做水電費；其餘的費都由慈聯會担任，難胞生產工作均在所外。</p>
<p>（五）第五自給所在戈登路盞榔路玉佛寺內該所事務由主任，副主任，會計，敎務及訓導員等處理日常事務；管理員，管理登記，生產，繕寫，庶務，給養，保管，衛生及醫務。難胞都是以前慈生收容所裹，能够自給的難胞。年紀大的和年紀小的難胞，及該所職員共計四百四十七人由該所供給飯食；自已買飯吃的人有一百八十四人，每天二百文。生產工作有的在所內，也有在所外的以信。衣服有的自備，有的由該所供給。敎育方面分兒童班，婦女班，及男子班：兒童班編六級，共一百餘人，全日受課；惇信路難民大棚於去年十月間動工落成，佔地四十餘畝格內有床舖課室及醫藥等設備（上海難民救濟恊會宣傳處攝）婦女班三十餘人，成人班六十人左右，每天上課一小時。</p>
<p>（六）基督敎第十八自給所：組織分：宗敎，庶務，醫藥，敎育，伙食，登記六組，難胞大部由以前十八所改組成功的，也有從他處遷入的，但須經牧師的保證。人數的共三四百人。每月飯錢四元，五歲至十二歲繳半費，五歲以下免費；房金朝南每間四元半，朝北每間四元，每間至多住八人爲限；電燈每盞八元。兒童敎育初小六級分成四班，附設幼稚園，有獨立敎室。成人班敎育尚無；難胞除上課時間外可以自由出入。其中還有一部分老弱無力生產的人仍山該所供給給養。</p>
<p>此外還有一個原在慈聯分會第三十六所，現已改成雖工寄宿舍，是初創辦，內部組織簡單，難胞共十餘人，每月每個靴胞付飯錢四元半，由該所煮飯分給，每天二决，上午十一點和下午五點；其餘不加顧問。有出所工作，有在所工作，難胞出入絕對自山，完全是寄宿舍性質，該所祗收女工，所以又稱女工寄宿舍。</p>
<p>自從自給所成立後，减少一部的共衆消費，又能增加生產，在難胞自身方面，可以生產，同時又能鍜鍊身體，這不是一舉二得嗎？</p>
<p>綜觀各所自給情形，影象甚佳，這也救濟難民中很大的成就，內依賴的生活，逐漸進而爲自立的生活，不久的將來，難民能自給一定會逐漸增多，正可拭目以待。</p>
<h3>民族英雄　石童子</h3>
<p>— 金以熙</p>
<p>明嘉靖年間，江浙沿海一帶，常常受人家欺侮，那年也和現在一樣，有兵來犯，當時焚燒刦掠，好淫殺戳，無所不爲，幸賴各地官兵民團的努力抵抗，而於以平定。午上海之西北（南翔直北，羅店直西）的一個小小城池呌做嘉定的地方，也雞免遭此擾害。</p>
<p>那是一個沉靜的晚上，夜色籠照了大地，陰天黑月，凉風穿過了疎林，微微吹着，宿烏驚棲，啾啾地有如鬼哭之聲，遍野的古樹，撑起了枯幹，橫在旁路，好像仲出了鐵一般的手在抓人，一種幽寂暗關的氣息，呌人看了要汁毛都根根堅起來。黑影憧憧地巡羅的兵丁戒備着，兇猛的敵兵終於不能得手而懊傷着。</p>
<p>但是人的精力，總究有限，每一個兵，丁，防守了幾個畫夜之後，一個個都疲倦了下來，睡魔於是抓起了每人們的眼皮，都呼呼熟睡着了。</p>
<p>這時敵兵自從圍城攻不下手，巳是焦急萬狀，瞥見城牆上的黑影子稀疏地，便認爲可以攻城的時機到了。長梯哪，吊繩哪，帶了傢伙，冒着黑色的天空，直往城墻的缺口那邊躡手躡足地爬向前去。</p>
<p>正常危急萬分的當兒，有一個童子，聽見了可異的「悉索」聲，往着眼子裹探望。</p>
<p>「啊呀！」不看猶可，一看驚動了他的一顆熱血澎湃的心，回顧那些伙伴們，又都一個個的酣聲大作。他咬緊了牙關，不做聲的緊緊地握住了大刀，伏在缺口邊，候那敵兵的到來，要給予一個重重的敎訓。</p>
<p>敵兵們，一個個迅如雷電般的升上來了，當頭要望裏張看動靜的時侯，不防斜刺裏伸出了一把雪亮的大刀，「格察」一聲，身首便此分家，一個，二個，三個，……在「格察」的聲響中，一個個地分了家往下滾。像切菜也似的非常痛快。</p>
<p>「嘩」！一堆人羣的呼聲，醒了醒了，醒了那些睡眼朦朧的官兵民團，在一羣嘈雜的聲音裹。</p>
<p>「殺呀！敵兵來了！」童子直着喉嚨，在緊張的空氣裹高喊着。</p>
<p>「殺呀！敵兵來了！同胞們快起來！」官兵民團，都響應了。</p>
<p>在一番浮動的刀光劍影下，不知割下了多多少少的人頭忽然「怦」的，一聲，由遠處發來了一個砲彈，只見那個童子應聲而倒。可憐他爲了國家，爲了地方，就道樣地含笑的躺在那邊犧牲了。</p>
<p>但是，這孩子雖然被打死了而敵兵終於在協力的反攻中，敗退了，去遠了。於是嘉定全城的生命財產，得以保障了。</p>
<p>這一段短短的故事中，含滿着多少的熱血，悲壯啊！現在的嘉定東北兩個城門口上，裝有童子的石像，就是紀念他的偉蹟，永遠地給人追慕這一幕悲壯的境遇。</p>
<h3>生活素描　教母親識字　第二報童學校</h3>
<p>— 李洗義</p>
<p>十二月八日</p>
<p>今天我起來洗面刷牙就到報館去拆了幾份報。母親到小菜塲裹去賣魚的。我送的報送完了，就到小菜塲稱母親賣魚。我同母親賣魚賣完了，回家燒飯。吃了中飯，我敎母親讀書，敎了半個多月，有的鈔票上的字，母親能够識了，我一面敎母親，一面自己讀書寫字，到了四點鐘，我又拿了錢到發報處，拆了幾份晚報，賣完了我就上學校去讀書。</p>
<h3>一周戰事</h3>
<p>廣東</p>
<p>廣東各綫，自華軍猛烈反攻後，日軍即縮短戰錢，整理待援，更在廣州外圍之增城，黃埔，順德，九江，佛山，三水，一帶，積極構築工事，以爲退守進攻之計，近增城及上下羅岡之日軍，連日被華軍某部襲擊，大起恐慌，連夜發砲，銷耗彈藥不少。石龍之日軍二十八日夜被華軍某部襲擊，與日軍巷戰，相持數小時，日軍頗有損失。至拂曉時，華軍乃安然退回原陣地，佛山之日軍一部，的千人調官窰，另由九江調回的一聯隊塡補，似在換防調整。三水日軍的一師團，亦在積極準備，聞尚有後續部隊續在運輸，其對西江頗有積極企圖，北海，瓊崖海面日艦，未見有何活動。</p>
<p>粵漢</p>
<p>粵漢北段戰事，最近數日，頗爲沉靜，兩軍仍在新墻河九嶺街之綫對峙，華軍某部，於日前夜襲臨湘之桃林，日軍應戰不暇，向北敗退。</p>
<p>南潯</p>
<p>南潯方面，中日兩軍仍在修河兩岸對峙，除游擊隊不時與日軍有小接觸外，正面迄無激烈戰爭，華軍於元旦拂曉，乘日軍不備，分向永修德安間，各要點之日軍猛烈攻擊。頗奏功效，現華軍在追擊中。</p>
<p>鄂豫</p>
<p>鄂北方面，應山，桃林，河觀，河舖，等處之日軍，經華軍攻擊後，大數口退淅河，關帝廟日軍，亦退應山，安陸日軍，經華軍某隊攻擊，克靑龍潭後，日軍向後退却，皂市日軍，的一千戒備甚嚴，似無進攻意志，豫南方面，近無戰事，惟豫東方面之日軍，甚爲活勸，商邱開封，近增日軍至五六千人，其中一部份進犯杞縣，正與華守城部隊激戰。通許雖被日軍佔據，但因華游擊隊，牽制作用，一時尚不敢西犯，豫北方面，新鄕日司令部，曾被華便衣塚襲擊，起火焚燒竟日，新鄉以北之車站，亦被華軍佔領，日軍現在向北退去。</p>
<p>晉綏</p>
<p>山西之日軍，企圖積極團攻晋西華軍，以爲波河西犯之準備，日前曾一度開始進犯，一路由河津北犯之日軍，經華軍在禹門山附近，予以痛擊，巳向河出方面退去，另一路山臨汾西犯之日軍，念九日與汾陽南下之日軍，合退大寗，並任一都份軍隊，擾吉縣鄉寗，現在華軍正與之迎戰，另外更有由汾陽，越九峪南犯之日軍，亦遇華軍迎擊，想來不易得逞，而由離石西犯之日軍，刻在柳林附近與華軍周旋，現華軍正分途驅擊中，總之，吉縣，鄕寗間爲華軍預定戰塲，早有周密佈置，預料該方面之日軍，不日恐將受重大打擊，緩遠包頭一帶日軍，續有增加，似有西犯模樣，因恐華游擊隊襲擊，近將包頭城周卅里以內之民房悉數拆除，無家可歸之難民，已羣起參加游擊隊，這樣一來，日軍將受重大威脅，同時該地偽軍互相內鬨，其比較有力部隊，有醞釀反正之消息。</p>
<p>河北</p>
<p>平漢綫北段各要點，駐有日軍甚多，石家莊附近，的有日軍萬除，其一部的七千餘，已陸續向西移動，似有增山西模樣。</p>
<p>總之綜合本週戰事，各方面均無特別大戰鬥，在華南方面廣東之日軍，似有固守廣東附近要點，及虎門，東莞，等處之據點，以主力由三水進犯肇慶，但經華軍各綫同時出擊，日軍已有首尾不能兼顧之勢，連日來迭受重創，只能退困原陣地，在華中各綫愿間有小接觸，日軍似集中武漢整理，而華軍也在俟機圍擊，在華北方面，山西，綏察之日軍，頗欲蠢動，曾分途進犯晋西各地，惟經華軍迎頭痛擊，損失頗鉅，仍在河津，吉縣，離石，一帶，對抗中，華軍防範嚴密，兵力雄厚，日軍欲突破渡河西犯，實不容易，當此第二期抗戰開始之時，日軍流入山地，於華軍實爲有利。無論戰略，及戰術各方面，日軍已俱見心勞力拙，捉襟見肘，目前華軍若利用新的戰略與戰術，實行全面戰爭，則日軍當更疲於奔命，將來之勝利，在期待中</p>

<h3>「面子」與改變面孔</h3>
<p>— 度浸</p>
<p>中國上等人是愛講「面子」的，惟其愛講「面子」，所以常常要改變面孔。——這聽去似乎很古怪，然而却是的確的。</p>
<p>「面子」到底是甚麼，我們中國人自然是懂得的。可是有些研究中國的外國人，却就說「面子」和從前中國的「禮」一樣，很難找到相當的字去翻譯。實在要把「面子」這個名詞解釋淸楚，也確是困難得很。不過，大致說來，所謂「顧全面子」，總不外是做了甚麼丟人的事却不要揭穿而已。——這自然不是「面子」的精義，但我一時實在想不出更明瞭的說法，只好姑且算數。實際上，面子主義所發揮的方面，却是極其廣汎的。</p>
<p>相傳滿淸未年有一個故事。一位小官懷恨一位大官，故意當到那位大人在送客的時候，跑到面前像報告機密大事似的低聲說：「把大人底媽媽賞給卑職做老婆好嗎？」這話是傍邊的人都聽不見的，於是那位大人便大聲回答道；「可以，可以。明天辦明天辦。」這因爲沒有傷到「面子」，就是說沒有揭穿，所以便這樣來一下了事。但是滿淸底官僚却還有一種方式：他和一位下屬談話，若是那人不小心揭穿了他底某種秘密，就是說有點傷着他底「面子」的時候，他會給你個冷不防，突然把臉一沉，像完全不認得似的說：「我忘記了你底台甫楚——」意思是給對方也掃一下「面子」。這便是爲面子而改變面孔的具體表現。</p>
<p>不過不管怎樣，所謂「面子」也眞和從前的「禮」一樣，只是上層階級底把戲，實在下層階級並沒有這種思想。倘是不信，你目試從下等人底嘴裹去探聽一下，他們從來就不說「面子」這兩個字。自然，他們也常常駡人「不要臉」，但那含義卻簡單的多。和「顧全面子」很有些不同。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，下等人便不像上等人那樣容易改變面孔。昨天說他是我底夥計，今天說他是我底仇人，到明天又把自己打一個耳光，說我原是他底乾兒子。昨天說我是一條鐵漢，今天說我是「力疾從公，到明天却又眉頭一皺，說我有「疾」不能「從公」了……這些作風豈是下等人所能玩得出夾的？</p>
<p>我們有時固然在文獻上常常看見下等人好像在改變着面孔，但實際上那却多半是上等人替他們畫的「面譜」。譬如義和團，我們要是在「東華續錄」裹面去認識他們底面目時，那先是「拳匪」，後來却變作「義民」，到最後父變成了「拳匪」。然而只要眞懂得歷史的人，便知道眞正改變而孔的，却是在顧全自己面子的當時的朝廷，而義和團始終只是義和團。當時主角之一的筮福祥，土匪出身，他底臉上被人家畫上了「面譜」以後，便覺得詫異得很，還寫過一封信去實問榮祿，那用上海話的術語來批評時，便叫做「不識相」。</p>
<p>中國底聖人是聰明的，他把上等人就呌作「君子」，把下等人就呌作「小人」。這一來，上等人永遠是好人，下等人永遠是壞蛋。「君子之德風，小人之德草。」。上等人飄忽不定，使人捉摸不住，却只看見下等人在東囫西倒。</p>
<p>因爲下等人不「顧全面子」，同時也沒有知識，所以一任上等人把他們有時陞爲愛國者，有時貶爲「流寇」。至於上等人呢，自然到死總是「君子」。還有一個不大相干的例。</p>
<p>據說上海剛陷落了的時候，有些江北人，守着租界和南市的交通口，在很坦白地指着自己胸前的號章向人說道：「阿拉是漢奸，曉得嗎？」這自然是眞話。然而也只有下等人的漢好纔會這樣老實的。若是上等人的漢奸却就不會傻到這種程度。他們不但永遠不會自認爲漢好，而且還要在你面前狠狠地把漢奸大駡一通。</p>
<h3>老劉</h3>
<p>— 何龍昇</p>
<p>牛毛的雨，陰瑟的風。天色有點不大悅意的灰暗，光明的影子好似隱在一方。</p>
<p>這樣的天，眞是大殺風景，打消了人們的遊興。「討厭……」老王穿着筆挺的西裝，口含烟斗，走向窗前，對天埋怨。</p>
<p>「討厭的事多着哩，少爺公子只曉得玩吧。」老陳戴着八百度近視跟鏡正瞧着中國文學史大綱出神時，被老王的話激動了，不耐煩地這樣說。</p>
<p>「……害獃子曉得什麼？……今朝有酒今朝醉……像你這樣，一輩子也煩惱不了！……生命如蜉蝣，朝不保夕，你記得老劉的手嗎？……」</p>
<p>「沒有思想的人，簡直是等於猪類！」</p>
<p>老王和老陳要打架似地爭辯起來。</p>
<p>一提起了老劉，興奮，傷感，湧上了我的心頭！……</p>
<p>……在崎嶇的道上，我們的救護車往前駛，……發見敵機追着我們的行踪，我們立刻停了車，……往田間躱，……槍彈如冰雹滾下，……天地之大，那裹傷得我們，……我們都赴福將！哈哈！……」老劉回來時很得意地這樣告訴我們。</p>
<p>「槍彈沒有眼睛，要當心啊！」可是他總不以爲意。白畫逐黃昏，黃昏逐白畫，好久不見他回來。我們中懷疑而憂懼。後來，事實告訴我們：他巳受傷了——當他的車子出發至中途時，倏忽間，天空現出了紅綠的信號，雖知事機不妙，機警的他，也來不及逃，子母彈有眼睛似的直射過來，鮮紅的血染滿了雪白的衣裳。啊！他們，他們，共三個人遭害了——他斷了左臂，一個斷了腿，還有一個中了要害在途中死了。</p>
<p>雪白的病床上躺着一個斷了臂的他，沒有絲臺憂巴的表露，沉靜莊重，似在祈禱什麼</p>
<p>「……算得什麼——你們不必担憂，過幾天我可以出院了。……」他說：「說來亦有趣，我本是救護人，現在人反來救護我。」</p>
<p>「人類本是互濟共存的，……愛人即愛已，殘人即殘己，……」我凑上說。</p>
<p>他的臉上現出了微笑，好似已獲得一點安慰而興奮起來</p>
<p>「豺狼會吃人，結果，死於獵人之手！……」</p>
<p>「……為了人家斷了臂，算得什麼！人家已爲我喪了生呢！……斷了臂就成爲廢人嗎？不！左臂斷了，還有右臂。老文斷了一倏腿，還有一條腿，老盛的身驅　死，他的精神永遠不死！……我們的血流不盡，民族的靈魂滅不了！……看！看他們活得多久！「公理」頭之日，即「强權」喪生之時。我們要認定目標，披荊斬棘地前進！……用血換得的生存，才是眞正的生存；用血寫成的歷史，才是光榮的歷史。……前進！前進！」</p>
<p>他忘懷了一切的痛苦，舉起！舉起唯一的手臂，握着拳高呼着，似熱血在沸騰，像火山在爆發，衝破了死寂的病房，打動了每個病人的心弦！</p>
<p>咦！老劉的話和他的形影，如今想起，仍歷歷如繪。可是現在他不知何處去了，也許爲了完成他的使命，在繼續向着光明的途徑邁進着吧！</p>
<p>隱的地聽見老牛從遠處哼：</p>
<p>「為國流血，國不亡，抵抗！抵抗！——」</p>
<p>黑雲漸漸消失了，東方露出微明。</p>

<p>三年前我離開了吳家巷。但我並不苦戀着她，因爲江灣也未始不美，我可以從現實的環境裏找出眞味來，又何必無聊地追戀過去呢。</p>
<p>但是，現在我却濃烈地追戀過去，在一幅幅回憶中，美麗的吳家巷便爭先湧浮上來。我深深地追憶着她，有時在淸早，有時在深夜。</p>
<p>吳家巷有持具的美，是活生生的美！那裹，有五百畝光景的土地，那裏，有數不淸的一羣靑年男女。我們之中，有鐵牛一般的漢子，有木蘭一般的少女，我們底小弟妹，却還是乳臭未乾的稚子哩。年長的，是破舊的學生裝和靑布的旗袍兒，年幼的，却全是威武的童子軍，裸着粗粗的一段腿，顯着桃紅色的一張臉，這是什麼？這不是活生生的美嗎？</p>
<p>淸早，是最可愛的一個時光。在晨議淸風裹，一聲號響，一羣羣靑年從四面底宿舍裏蜂擁出來，習慣地排成了一行行。體育敎員在旗桿前的高台上呼喊着，號鼓手一聲響，美麗的國旗嚴肅地爬上十丈高的桿頭，塲子上站着千把個人，却沒一點兒聲音，每一個人像一根鐵的柱子，向着國旗行着最敬禮！整齊，嚴肅，不是活生生的美嗎？</p>
<p>國旗在桿頭飄揚，雄壯的晨會歌聲跟着大喇叺怒吼着：『……撫淞滬戰創，戡不平的章，湧心頭熱血潮千丈，何日國威楊，主權張，英才發…勇往！上中靑年勇往！……」啊，好一個十足朝氣的淸早。</p>
<p>白天，我們全都忙碌在害本裹，龍門樓，先棉堂，就是我們銀鍊腦袋的塲所。四時以後，這兩座洋樓變得寂靜了，一羣羣，脫去了學生裝，猛向運動塲和體育館跑，在那裹，就是我們鍜鍊筋骨的塲所。文，武，那一樣可以省得了？</p>
<p>夕陽快溜向西方去了，國旗漲紅了臉爬下十丈桿頭，英武的號聲呌每一僩靑年站着不動，依舊像一根根鐵的柱于，保衛着我們底國旗，緩緩地蠕行下來。</p>
<p>晚上，五百畝光景的土地全都寂靜了，宿舍底窗洞發射着燈光，我們伙伴又在與知識拚命了。文，武，那一樣可以省得了？</p>
<p>但是，這樣的生活，我已經與她隔離三年了。那一種活生生的美，不時回復到我底眼珠邊，我斜視着，我默默地回憶。</p>
<p>回憶，玄想，叵憶，玄想；不覺吃驚起來！現在，十丈桿頭，不知飄着什麼旗兒？立體型的宿舍裹，我們底書桌，鐵床，不知成個什麼樣兒了？</p>
<p>可是，每一個早砭，號聲似乎依然在我的耳邊怒嗚，國旗似乎依然在我的眉間飄揚，我忍不住唱起吳家巷時底「晨會歌」來，晒台上，我獨個兒像鐵柱般站着，獨個兒用力地操着柔軟操。僅僅是一方晒台，正等於五百畝光景的廣塲。回憶沒有用，我們需要幹，需要永恒地幹！</p>
<h3>生與死的謳歌</h3>
<p>— 紹光</p>
<p>漫天的火花，</p>
<p>照耀着我們燦爛的前程，</p>
<p>激昂的號角，</p>
<p>喚醒了中華民族的迷夢。</p>
<p>誰不是堂堂的七尺之軀？</p>
<p>怎甘心任入屠殺，蹂躪！</p>
<p>我們要活，——可不怕死，</p>
<p>（死，要死得有價值！）</p>
<p>有見危授命的勇氣，</p>
<p>才配在現世紀做人！</p>
<p>有殺身成仁的决心，</p>
<p>方能爭取國家的永生!</p>
<p>我們要生，却不偷生，</p>
<p>（生，要生得有意義!）</p>
<p>而今，每一個角落，</p>
<p>充滿了殺敵的呼聲，</p>
<p>熱的血，熱的力，</p>
<p>四萬萬顆心，</p>
<p>築成了鐵一般的</p>
<p>新的偉大的長城!</p>
<p>耐着一切的苦痛，</p>
<p>鍜鍊堅韌卓絕的精神；</p>
<p>認淸時代，認淸友敵，</p>
<p>更要認淸我們的使命；</p>
<p>萬惡的鐵蹄一天不逐走，</p>
<p>神聖的抗戰便一刻不停！</p>
<p>謹記着吧，——</p>
<p>全中國的人民，</p>
<p>生，—要爲民族而生！</p>
<p>死，—要爲國家而死！</p>

<h3>「繁榮政策」</h3>
<p>— 桑子</p>
<p>據各方報道：「武士道」早期帶給我們的文化，是：焚燒，據掠，姦淫，屠殺；其目的在求「新秩序」之建立，所以纔拿這種大和魂的精神，來儘量的破壞我們的「舊」的一切。然而結果，他們却大失所望，「瘡痍滿目，腥羶遍地」的「新秩序」，果眞給他們造成了，但同時也喪失了大量足資榨取，足資吮吸的對象。這是違反他們原來所要求的現象，他們當然不甘願有這現象的存在，於是而有决期的「剛柔並施」政策的實行。</p>
<p>所謂「剛」的政策，依舊是那舊的一套：燒，刦，姦，殺；不過爲要顧到「柔」的方面，施展的手段較前似乎稍會「文明」些罷了。至於所謂「柔」的政策，那簡直是在那裹出把戲，自騙騙人；但是在他們卵翼下的一般「新貴」，却拿來作爲宣傳「王道樂土」的根據。當然，剛柔並施的結果，他們曾經收獲相當的成效，但不多時，他們顯然又失敗了。不僅那班所謂「莠民」未嘗上鈎，卽運一班所謂「良民」，也漸漸的明白他們的作用了。他們也自知所施的懷柔政策內容的不充實，所以不能得「民心」收實利，於是便又花樣翻新，以「繁榮政策」來輔助懷柔政策的推進。</p>
<p>繁榮政策的方針，是廣設「士膏店」，「俱樂部」和「妓院」他們以繁榮市面，增加稅收的理由來唆使他們的爪牙從事推行，那般「新貴」因有「橫塘」可撈，當然拚命工作。所以這一政策，已有滿意的「成績」，他們因此很快樂，認爲這不但可以獲得鉅量的財貨，挽救他們的貧困，而且還可以造成「繁榮」的「新秩序」，來誇耀世人。</p>
<p>孤島人丁興旺，財源茂盛，他們瞧着分外眼紅，然而因爲情形特殊，未便挿足，於是祇得在滬西一角，施展他們的繁榮政策，引誘一般島民，每日向他們繳納「繁榮」費，而最近又蔓延到虹口和浦東了。</p>
<p>孤島的四周，現在已被這喪喪我們民族的體力，消沉我們民族的意志，和毀滅我們民族的道德的繁榮政策所包圍了。一般島民應該認淸環境，節持氣脈，如果死在繁榮政策下，豈獨對不起祖宗，也對不起自身。</p>
<h3>已成歷史的上海路名</h3>
<p>— 潤圭</p>
<p>在幾十年前的上海，那各路名和現在，有着許多變換，不同。當時的路名大多以本地的土名取之，可是這些畢竟淘汰成歷史上的名字了，祗偶而在一些人們嘴上發見。在這兒，你就可以窺得全豹。</p>
<p>一般老上海所最熟悉的首推洋涇洪，然而這也是一個古舊的名字了。現在取笑一般講中國化的英語，就呌做洋涇浜，原因是因洋涇浜和外國人接觸的最早；另外公共租界土地規定法，也名洋涇浜規定法。其實洋涇浜是和蘇州河，曹河涇，北新涇，在英法租界交界處平行的一條河流；現在已把牠塡乎了，成了現在著名的愛多亞路。</p>
<p>這愛多亞路的權洋涇浜而起的事情，一般上海人也很熱知。少數外國人把和愛多亞路相交的路都取了個特別地名；像外灘和愛多亞路交界處稱「外洋涇橋」；在四川路轉角和愛多亞路相交處，當時也有橋的，不過後來因河塡平了，橋也沒有了，這就是「二洋涇橋」；在江西路愛多亞路相交處就是三洋涇橋。至於河南路和愛多亞路交接處，當然不是「四羊涇橋」，在牠（橋）毀滅之時的名字呌「三茅閣橋」，因爲當時有隻廟，名字就是「三茅閣」。這些「二洋涇橋」，「三洋涇橋！」「三茅閣橋」等的名字，巳被公共汽車公司公開承認，在路角的標記或在車資表上，也都用這些中國土名。</p>
<p>有一時，在洋涇浜的河面，曾建築起二條橋樑來，一在湖北路，另外一條在江西路，當時名字爲「東新橋」，「西新橋」，橋雖都已拆去，名字却還留着。另外還有條唯一無二的橋，在山東路跨過洋涇洪的，這就「帶鈞橋」。</p>
<p>大多數的中國人把上海著名的五條馬路，都不願說南京路，九江路，漢口路，福州路，和廣東路，却喜說「大馬路」，「二馬路」，……這是爲了便利起見。你知道「六馬路」嗎？這是北海路，是一段很短的東西向的馬路，在廣東路和愛多亞路之間，又接虞洽卿路——不久以前呌西藏路。</p>
<p>中國人叉歡喜把一條整段的路，分成數段各加以一專名，像在河南路南京路，以「拋球塲」出名；南京路浙江路交界處，名「日昇樓」，這些名字的來由，是因路角會有一家娛樂處或是茶館店。在河南路福州路的轉角，又有「棋盤街」，這是書店集中的所在；不過誰也不明瞭爲何呌這名字，有的說那邊路沿常設有許多職業的棋攤，誘着人去注錢；也有說這名字來因由於事實，因河南路，福州路，交通路和山東路，很像棋盤的四方。現在福州路已以「文化街」出名，這就因有許多書店。</p>
<p>在廣東路有一條「寶善街」，近湖北路的轉角，路雖已隱匿了，路名却還記憶着。同樣在漢口路和湖北路間，有名「大新街」。</p>
<p>在上海又有二「斜橋」，不過橋已都找不到了；其中一個在靜安寺路，另外一個在石灰港斜橋。近西門，當時也有一座圍城的橋；講到城河，現在早巳不能發覺其痕跡了，路名爲「新開河」。</p>
<h3>讀者呼聲　兩種發「國驗主財」者</h3>
<p>— 秋雯</p>
<p>上月間馬寅初博士曾提呈中央求對發「國難財」者，應予以重懲。自「八一三」發動後在孤島中縝密地觀察一下，確實不知有幾多喪絕天良的奸商在幹着發「國難財」的貞買。雖然這般奸商是堅守秘密主義，但到底逃不了羣衆的注意，依筆者所知，下面所述兩種是患害最烈的發「國難財」賣買。這自然也不過是幾十甚全幾百幾千種之幾罷了抗戰爆發，孤島上有少數銀樓錢莊（以　　路一帶爲最）就大肆活動起來。發了財的老闆更不可勝數。他們都是貪有厚利而把大量的赤白金銀和硬幣偷賣給　方。他們對於熟主顧（如內地各縣的銀樓）如有金銀賣給他們，都有一種暗盤。這種瞳盤超過市價很大，舉個例說；如最近紋銀每兩的兩元，而他們却可以出到兩元三角。中央銀行硬幣掉換法幣，每元可升一角五分，而他們却一元硬幣可換到法幣一元三角。有少數令利智昏的主顧自然不顧利害而賣給他們了。不過偶然有人盤詁他們的出路，不是說直解中央，便是說運到香港去；或承某處鉅商之托代爲收買，其實後者兩種一樣是違法的行動。而逃不出發「國難財」的罪名的！至於他們和主顧接洽的地點。大槪關室於旅館中。連本店裏的職員都無從察覺。</p>
<p>在閘北虹口和南市一帶的小米商，因戰事影響難免受到損失，旣無巨量資本在租界內重理舊業。就喪心病在的走到邪路去了。自去年內地農村秋收以後，一般小米商就活動起來了。先到　方去領取了運輸通行證。然後與　方某部言明在內地購得新米後直接販賣給他們作爲軍糧。他在從中取一筆佣金。倘使數量超過若干以上，還可以請　方派人代爲沿途保護。據說孤島上操此業者爲數確實可觀，而儼然已作富家翁者亦不少數呢！</p>
<p>「老聞」，「新閘」，「閘北」這些名宇，也常可聽到。「老閘」的意思，就是瞥理河流水平綫的一個建設。福建路是用北物質鋪砌成的，所以現在仍稱「石路」，而福建路橋也名「石橋」，講到了橋，道江西路橋，又名「自來水橋」，這名字來因由於橋邊的自來水棧塔。</p>
<p>河南路在出名之前呌「鐵馬路」這是因爲淞滬鐵路是在牠北面經過。比較奇特一些的各字，要算「偷鷄橋」了，這是在北京路浙江路相交處，這就是說那邊有一小石橋，不過現在也無痕跡了；至於說到稱爲「偷鷄」的原因，沒有一個人知道。</p>
<p>在四川路中國靑年會下一條馬　，這就是「老街」——很狹小的，在最新建設之前，這是條充滿肉鋪，酒館，飯店的狹小舊城街。在上海工部局决定路名受洗禮時，確也有許多土名被選用，採納，如「五福弄」，「金洋街」，「唐家弄」，「壽家橋」等。同樣在中央區，南北向的路都爲中國省名，如四川路，江西路，河南路，貴州路，雲南路，等；而東西向的路都名中國大城市，如南京路，九江路，漢口路福州路，北京路，廣東路，蘇州路等。（譯自英文大美晚報）</p>
<h3>新婚之夜“His　Exciting　Night”　環球公司出品　國泰大戲院映</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>却爾羅吉士是一個喜劇的丑角，他給我的印像並不深，但是我却記住一點，就是他和羅蘭特楊一樣，（他曾主演過「風流三昧」）是一個輕性幽默喜劇的丑角。</p>
<p>但是由却爾羅吉士獨當一面的來主演了這部「新婚之夜」，在聲望及營業把握上看，似乎都不够資望一點。</p>
<p>關於整個戲，我想分開幾面來說：</p>
<p>第一，是劇本編製上的，我以爲，在局部份編製的手法上看，它還是相當可愛的，尤其是後面公司職員亞當，被人誤傳巳墮崖而死以後，家人疑心他是「屍鬼還魂」一點，在喜劇的氣氛上，它是收獲到極良好的效果的。</p>
<p>但是，同時我們不得不指出，整個劇本故事發展之突兀與不自然，是傷害了整個影片的統一性的。最顯著的例子是：那個有神經病的汽車夫，他的出現，他的爲了不能唱歌而想自殺等等，這果然可以當作加强喜劇的效果，但用過份免强的人物或是過份生硬的手法，來免强帮助這個戲劇，那麼它的失敗，間樣是可以預期的其决，是關於人物個性上的，以我個人意見，把却爾羅吉士（亞當）寫成一個懦弱，膽小的人物，在這個喜劇中間，是應該收擭到良好的效果的，但是，亞當先前之懦弱和後來之喝了酒以後，突然變成過份的勇敢和粗暴，如該劇作者能够把它加强地對立起來，那麼全劇最後的收束，一定會比現在要好得多。因爲這劇本，在後面，亞當在怒後勇敢的情緒究竟是太軟弱了。</p>
<p>第二，應當談到的，自然是導演的手法了。我在前面說過，這個戲因爲劇本前後所寫的重心不平均，因此在氣氛上，它也透露了這個弱點。就是後面亞當發怒以後，他命令公司經理承認一切侮弄錯過的時候，在戲劇前後對照的力量上，它是大大削弱了戲劇的高潮的。</p>
<p>導演者對於這個收束，也沒有用較好的手法來補充它加强它，因此戲到後面便不能自己的鬆散下來。</p>
<p>不過，在全家人把亞當當作鬼的氣氛空氣上，以導演手法說，它是確實還不壞的，那新娘姑母看見亞當而暈到，黑種僕人看見亞當　驚惶失措，（我們對於美國片把黑人常常寫成那樣愚蠢，常覺得無限的反感）安妮看見亞當而暈厥過去……，這些，把人當作鬼看的喜劇空氣上，它也確把觀衆的情緒，前後拉得緊緊地。</p>
<p>全片演員，除了却爾羅吉士的戲很重頭以外，其餘演員的戲都不很多的，尤其是女角戲似乎太少了。</p>
<h3>雨過天睛第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>那朱老源的孫女兒，送到了章醫師的醫院裹，章醫師倒也很疼愛她。給她取了一個名字，喚做朱愛人，這愛人兩字，就是傳愛之意。便敎她讀書寫字，好在這個醫院裏人多，便是看護小姐們，也有不少。敎會也附設有小學，章醫師竟把這位鄉下小姑娘，像自己的女兒一般看待了。朱愛人又很爲活潑，跳出跳進，又有許多的姊妹。身上一切衣服之類，都由章醫師做給他穿。光陰迅速，朱愛人已是十七歲，高中也畢業了。那時章醫師有位美國女朋友，也是一位女醫師，正要回國去一趟。章翳師便託她，把這位義女朱愛人，帶到美國去，好在她在本國的學校裹，英文已有了根柢了。到美國醫學校留學了四五年，學問自然大進，朱愛人不是從前的鄉下小姑娘了。原來章醫師要派她到美國去留學，也是很有深意的。因爲章醫師自從辦了這座婦孺醫院後，逐漸擴充，規模也益發宏大。除了她的本院仍在那個大市鎭上，其餘就有了好幾處分院而且醫院之外，還有好幾個育兒院。就是本醫院的規模，也非比從前。拓地近百畝，房屋都楚新造起來的五層樓，六層樓。一切設備，應有盡有，雖然是個婦孺醫院，却是現代一個最完備的婦孺醫院。周圍還有一個大好園林，水木明瑟，花鳥淸幽，因爲這幾年來，婦女們的生產，都到醫院裹去，所以醫院中倒是越發忙了。雖然各分醫院都有分院長，各育兒院也有育兒院長，可是主持總理的人，還靠託章文綺女醫師一人。因此她想把她的義女朱愛人栽培起來，將來繼承她的事業，也可以託付有人。且說朱愛人婦國以後，自然在自己的醫院裹服務，幫助她的義母章醫師不少的力量。因爲章醫師雄然也留學過外國，但是世界的醫學是日新月異，一年功夫，不知有多少新發明，新學理。新的出來了，舊的漸漸就要淘汰，她所得的都是最新的，自然在醫學上，技術上，得益不少。况自像章醫師父是忙於醫務行政，也沒功夫每天爲學術上的研究咧。　（八）</p>

<h3>舞蹈的欣賞　一·舞蹈是什麽</h3>
<p>— 家聲</p>
<p>舞蹈是甚麼？這是應該先得說明的一個問題。</p>
<p>在中國，舞蹈藝術還不曾被人注意過，所以，一般人對牠的觀念，以爲所謂舞蹈，便是酒店或跳舞塲裹隨着爵士音樂的節奏而跳的那種舞，以及那些低級趣味的歌舞團之流的跳舞。其實，這是誤解。自然，那種舞也算是一種舞蹈，然而在舞蹈的起源與發展，以及文化的原則上，那可不能算牠是種正統的舞蹈，最多只能說牠是商業資本主義時代以來的有閒階級的一種裝飾交際品，而且，反違害了正統舞蹈的進展。</p>
<p>那麼，所謂的正統舞蹈究兌是甚麼呢？</p>
<p>舞蹈本是從人類的行動中起源的。有了人類，就有了舞蹈的基本姿態。原始人的意志感情，在文字繪畫等都沒有發生的時候，幾乎都是反映在舞蹈與音樂上的。以後舞蹈的進展也脫不了這個任務，因此，可說舞蹈是人類意識和感情的形態之組織化的表現。牠與文學或別的藝術的內容是同一原則出發的。所不同的只是表現的工具而已，換言之，舞蹈不用文字或言語而是用人的動作之細綫條或粗綫條的美型姿態描寫人類的行動和感情。而且牠的內容與姿態也隨着時代的變動而變動，比如「祈神舞」，只能產生於宗敎統治的社會。</p>
<p>二·舞蹈之質的剖析</p>
<p>欣賞舞蹈，先得理解各種舞蹈，如土風舞，抒情舞，叙事舞，體育舞，交際舞的本質。</p>
<p>體育舞只是種修養身體健康的美型動作，至於交際舞根本就缺少藝術性，所以不去談牠。這裹要說的是搬上舞台表演的各種有意義的舞。</p>
<p>「土風舞」是種民俗舞蹈，牠正如昔樂中的民謠曲一樣，不過就是用身體動作的姿態表現民間的生活形式，因此，從這種舞蹈中可以認識到民族的特性與勞動的獨有姿態。比如看了「西班牙播種舞」，就知道西班牙農民的勞動姿態與別民族的是顯然不同的。同時，我們鑑賞到「土風舞」粗俗的直綫姿態，不可鄙視，反應看出這疋是牠的特點。所謂農民動作之直綫的樸實美。</p>
<p>「抒情舞」是種極富於詩意的舞蹈。在法國曾有人將此呌做舞詩一。這種舞是印極細膩的姿態與唯美的動作描寫軟性的題材。而且這題材多取自美麗的神話或戀愛的故事，賞鑑這種舞蹈，可以把牠常作與音樂中的「夜樂」或「樂詩」一樣的看法。</p>
<p>「叙事舞」好像叙事詩樣的用種級數的姿態描寫一個整個史事。古代的叙事舞多是描寫英雄的偉蹟與騎士和美人的戀愛的悲喜劇，中世紀的叙事舞自然是描寫神，「創世紀舞」便是產生在這時代。近代與現代的叙事舞描寫的多是人的集體行動。叙事舞就是啞劇的雛形，但又與啞劇不同，因爲「叙事舞」的動作純粹是舞姿，沒有劇動作的成分。</p>
<p>「抒情舞」與「叙事舞」很早就搬上舞臺了，「土風舞」在近代也被搬到舞臺上，因此，這幾種舞呌做舞臺舞，而且其效果在舞毫上更顯得深刻。</p>
<p>這幾種舞蹈旣搬上舞臺。那就需要配合牠能在舞臺上的諸條件，如燈光，服裝，佈景，特別是舞蹈曲創作與舞蹈音樂的應用，欣賞舞臺舞對這些客觀上的條件，絕不可忽視牠的配合價值。（未完）</p>

<p>二天的節目是略微有些不同的，我去的是第一天，第一個節目是靑年會管弦樂隊演奏的「前奏曲」，第二個是「獨唱」，第三個是吳曉邦的「舞蹈，第四個才是話劇「實現的夢一。「實現的夢」是由「人之初」的導演吳伋之先生導演的。看過「人之初的觀衆，大概是不會忘了吳仭之先生的細膩的手法的，在「實現的夢一中，我們仍舊感到吳仭之光生的親切的手法。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（六九）　落馬湖的地主姓馬</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>武生劇裏有一種專重唸、白、作派，及工架等的短打戲，旣不甚喧鬧紛亂，又能使觀者精神振奮，此類戲可名之曰小武戲，像「惡虎村」「落馬湖」「盜御馬」等全是結構緊嚴，武戲文唱的「骨子戲」比較那些千篇一律的「霸王莊」「　蜡廟」眞是高出百倍。說到這裹就令人想起已故武生泰斗楊小樓來，那種爽脆的嗓音，細膩的作工，將來那能再有第二個人及得上他，據一般老顧曲家說來，小樓的這幾齣戲從此皆成廣陵散了。</p>
<p>落馬湖道個地方，就在江蘇北部邳宿兩縣境內，雖沒有蘇州的太湖面積寬大，可是因爲戲劇的宜傳，幾至婦孺皆知了。當滿淸初葉康熙在位的時候，有一位把守後宮門的武職官員，此人姓馬，名字呌甚麼，不佞已記不很淸：這人原籍就是徐州，他爲人頗能謹愼守法，越軌的事情，旣不敢作，徇私舞弊，更是不幹，因此纔得到十八路大總管（情末李蓮英是這個名稱，統管宮內各路事宜。淸初是吾已有此名稱，尚待調查。）的信任，就派他這個巡宮守夜，把守後宮門的重耍差事。</p>
<p>胤禎（康熙第四子，即後之雍正。）自幼就好出宮閑遊，常時換了靑衣小帽到民間各級社會裹廝混，茶酒飯館以及京城內外的各大寺院，都是他足跡常到的地方。據說部上講起，他因性嗜武術，結識俠客甚衆，秘組血滴子這個殺人的團體，以備謀篡不成時刺王殺駕之需：所以他常好早出晚歸，趕在關閉宮門以前，潛行回宮，康熙因爲兒子太多，那能注意到他的行徑，故而他後來的膽子就越慣越大。有一回適值天降大雪，滿地都積雪盈尺，脚底下非常油滑，偏又碰着迎頭的逆風，一步一跌，當然走的極慢，及至他好容易趕到後宮的門口，一望宮門早已關閉了。</p>
<p>「現實的夢」是描寫女孩子們的幻想，她們夢想着有一個年靑的情人，寫甜蜜的情書給她，送玫瑰花給她，甚至送一個訂婚戒指給她，但這祗是一個夢，一個「不實現的夢」。然</p>
<h3>汪晚萸　編寫七幕劇「歸來」</h3>
<p>— 古味</p>
<p>青年作家在晚英，文字輕快流利，其作品常刋於本刋及各報劇刊，頗爲讀者愛載。</p>
<p>汪君於戲劇有相當研究。昔年在滬粵，曾組織劇社，專門編導各種愛國戲劇，前往學校民衆機關上演，成績殊佳。最近在君於著作之餘，亦在編寫劇本，劇本定名『歸來』，七幕。內容係叔述一個靑年自戰地歸來：立意純正，深含敎育作用。且情節離奇，對社會頗多針砭。現巳編就五幕，本星期內即可結束。將來或交某劇塲上演，或出版單行本，尚未决定。（却酬）</p>
<p>而據說女孩子是希望這種「幻夢」的「實現」，所以，「不貫現的夢」也改做「實現的夢」了。</p>
<p>小鳳的安妮，頗能把一般女孩子們藏在心的深處的熱情流露出來，她在漢洛拒絕，她的最後的請求以後，她在失望之餘，仍舊坐到火爐邊的沙發上去，寫着理想的情書。一種不可遏止的少女的痴情，她是儘量地流露了。飾漢洛的吳兀良，或許是舞台經騐的欠缺，他演得過火一點，我以爲也至少該冉溫柔點。飾蘿施的袁榮湘，或許也是怯塲」吧，發昔太低了。但大致上說來，成續是不能說壞的。</p>
<p>最後還有顧傳玠的「販馬記」，因爲自已劉於崑劇沒有興趣，祗有把好戲犧牲了。</p>

Chinese reinforcements are continuously moving forward, seeking opportunities to attack the Japanese rear. Chinese forces along the Yellow River have been strengthened, making it difficult for Japanese troops to cross surreptitiously. Zhengzhou and Luoyang are quiet. There are still occasional artillery sounds at Tongguan and Fenglingdu. Units redeployed from various occupied areas in the north have all reached their destinations. Japanese troops in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan have been quite busy with deployments recently. They are exerting utmost effort to attack Chinese guerrilla forces, attempting to clear the rear. Chinese units have already entered Chahar to attack Japanese troops.

<h3>Wang Jingwei in a Dilemma, Colluding with the Beiping Side, Japan Encourages Him to Go to the Puppet Government, a Letter to the Central Government Published in Hong Kong Intended to Confuse the People</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Wang Jingwei has returned to Hanoi. Military and political leaders in various regions mostly advocate for his arrest and prosecution. The central government is not yet planning to take this step. If Wang takes further action, then the final measure will be adopted. (Special dispatch, 2:30 AM, August 9)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Political circles here are paying close attention to Wang Jingwei's attitude after the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet. Well-informed sources say that Wang had colluded with the Beiping side before fleeing, but was not related to Liang Hongzhi, so the Nanjing side opposes him serving as president of the puppet central government. Japanese special agencies are strongly encouraging him to go to Guangzhou to form a puppet government, which Wang opposes. He is now in a dilemma. As for Wang's whereabouts, it has again become a mystery. Several sources believe that Wang has never been to Hong Kong, but some sources claim that he has already passed through Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai, hibernating in Hongkou under Japanese protection. This claim comes from the fact that the Japanese military police have implemented special martial law in the Hongkou area. According to well-informed sources, Wang is currently residing in a certain village six miles from Hanoi. This claim is considered more reliable. It is believed that Wang, encountering difficulties in his conspiracy, has today departed for Yangon, preparing to go to Europe immediately. (Associated Press telegram, August 8)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tonight, Wang Jingwei's associates stationed in Hong Kong publicly released a letter from Wang to the Central Executive Committee and the National Defense Committee, dated December 28 of last year. The letter stated in part: "On December 9, I expressed to Chairman Chiang the opinion that both China and Japan now realize their difficult situations, so peace is not impossible. Regarding foreign relations, we can hope for the assistance of Britain, the United States, and France, the tacit consent of the Soviet Union, and the non-interference of Germany and Italy. However, the key is that Japan realizes that China cannot be conquered by force, and that the entire Far East cannot be placed under Japan's hegemony. The declaration issued by the Japanese government on December 22 indicates that Japan has appropriately realized its position regarding China. I recall that before the fall of Nanjing, the conditions proposed by Japan through the German ambassador, although not as good as they are now, nor as certain as they are now, Chairman Chiang still did not hesitate to recognize them as the basis for negotiations. However, later, due to Japan's own hesitation, and because Japan changed the previously proposed conditions after the fall of Nanjing, the matter was shelved. Now that Japan has reconsidered its attitude, we should issue a declaration of the basis on which we can negotiate, as a pseudo-response, in order to restore peace and stabilize the overall situation in the Far East. Know that such an opportunity to end the war, once missed, cannot be regained. The assistance of Britain, the United States, and France is now gradually being realized. However, this assistance can only put us in a better position to engage in peace negotiations, because it absolutely cannot enable us to win the final victory through military planning, and achieve the substantial result of war. It is obvious that the Soviet Union cannot provide large-scale assistance to China alone without the cooperation of Britain, the United States, and France, and Germany and Italy will certainly not fail to support the restoration of peace. As for the internal situation, apart from the Communist Party and other undesirable elements, I see no reason for anyone to oppose honorable peace. After careful consideration, I dare to make this proposal. I have expressed my humble opinion to Chairman Chiang, and I now write to the Committee, hoping that you will appreciate my foolish sincerity and give your approval." (Reuters telegram, August 8)</p>

<h3>Central Daily News Commentary: The Hiranuma Cabinet</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, Chen Bosheng, editor-in-chief of the Central Daily News, published a special commentary in the newspaper, stating in part that, in terms of the selection of personnel for the Hiranuma Cabinet, those who agreed with the policies of former Prime Minister Konoe have all remained in office, while those who opposed his opinions and forced him to resign have all left office. Therefore, there will be no major changes in Japan's foreign policy regarding its relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, or in its policy towards China. It will largely follow the original policies of the Konoe Cabinet. The addition of representatives from both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties to the new cabinet has completely dispelled rumors that the new cabinet would be organized entirely according to fascist principles as a single national party. Today, the attitude of Japan's new Prime Minister Hiranuma is very different from what it was a few years ago, and he will not endorse a purely fascist policy, because the Japanese Fascist Party founded by Hiranuma himself was dissolved a few years ago. Therefore, the Hiranuma Cabinet is merely a continuation of the previous cabinet, and will largely follow the policies of the previous cabinet. According to Chen, he used to be a correspondent for the Central News Agency stationed in</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from Guangdong Province, the Japanese troops in the West River have been actively reinforcing their forces in recent days, attempting to once again peer west from Sanshui and seize Wuzhou, a vital point connecting Guangdong and Guangxi. The situation along the Yangjiang to Beihai area of the southern route is very tense, because the Japanese army has plans to dispatch troops to land in Yangjiang, Dianbai, Beihai, and other places. At present, in addition to mobilizing a large army to deploy defenses in the West River and the southern route, the Chinese side has also dispatched a large army to counterattack Guangzhou from the northeast and two rivers, so that the Japanese army dare not dream of westward invasion of Guangxi Province.

Yamada is a key member of the young and vigorous faction of the Japanese army, but he lacks wisdom and military experience, so it is conceivable that he will not be able to achieve success.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, abbreviated as the Fifth Plenary Session; according to a telegram from Chongqing, it has been confirmed that it will open in Chongqing on the 20th of this month, which is about ten days away. According to the Kuomintang's General Regulations, the Central Committee Plenary Session is an organization within the party that is second only to the National Congress. It is convened once every six months, and the meeting place must be located in the central government. The importance of its nature and authority is self-evident. It can be said that the affairs of the state and the governance of the party are not merely matters of one party. In the past twenty years, the major plans of the party and the nation have all originated here. Moreover, in extraordinary times, the war of resistance and national construction involve thousands of complexities, looking ahead and behind, carrying on the past and opening up the future. Matters either await exploration or await vigorous implementation, and every move is related to the future of the party and the nation. Therefore, this Fifth Plenary Session is certainly not comparable to the regular semi-annual meetings of the past.</p>
<p>The agenda and the motions of the Fifth Plenary Session are not known to outsiders. Even the most important topics to be decided are not revealed in advance by the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, as they have been in previous plenary sessions. Since the main agenda has not been disclosed so far, this reporter has no way to discuss the specific matters. However, there are several situations that we usually feel deeply uneasy about, and we would like to briefly state them here. A fool's thousand thoughts may yield a single gain!</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang adopted the General Executive system following the decision of the Provisional National Congress last year, people inside and outside the party have praised it. It is believed that power has been concentrated, and the will has been unified, strengthening the organization and accelerating progress. However, as time has passed, there have not been many visible achievements. This is because, during wartime, military affairs are paramount, and there is no time to devote full effort to the party. Even if great achievements have been made, they have been obscured by the war and not fully known to the public. This is due to both subjective and objective reasons. Of course, the results have not been as expected. As the overall situation enters a more severe stage in the future, we should still recognize the urgency, importance, and severity, and should not demand perfection. However, the Central Committee members must not be too lenient with themselves. The status of the original Central Committee members within the party is not diminished by the General Executive system. Their service in the party, government, or society is not reduced to subordination because military affairs are paramount during wartime. Moreover, based on a sense of self-respect that is appropriate and a sense of responsibility that is shared by all people, they should have the spirit of the General Executive in their attitude towards the party, the nation, society, and even the duties they hold, and should be a thousand times more diligent and hardworking than ordinary party members and people. In this way, in addition to the General Executive being sincerely admired and regarded as the sole leader by the nation, the Central Committee members should also demonstrate their extraordinary qualities to ordinary party members and the people in various aspects of their spirit. It is important to know that the ability of any organization to maintain immortality depends on the formation of a good tradition by the core members, and cannot be permanently relied upon by any natural person. The Kuomintang has the General Executive, but there is still much to be done by the Central Committee members, who are its core members. We believe that the Kuomintang's future in politics depends on how the Central Committee members create a solid foundation for the party. If the core members are inferior, then the future will be inferior. What is worrying lies in oneself and not in others. The people have high expectations for the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang should have practical achievements to meet the people's high expectations. This is the first point. The Kuomintang has always established the party and the nation with a revolutionary spirit, but in the last decade, the revolutionary spirit has declined. Regardless of matters related to state affairs, just talking about the party, such as planning the party's organization, promoting and practicing the party's doctrines and policies, sanctioning all violations of party discipline, and selecting personnel for central and local positions at all levels, we often find that the revolutionary spirit is not thorough. Often, it is launched with great fanfare and with the force of a thunderbolt, but ends up buried in obscurity. Judging the circumstances, of course, there must be unavoidable difficulties, which are understood by the party. However, the feelings involved, the impact, and the inadequacy of the effectiveness of the results cannot be fully accepted by the people. The root causes vary and cannot be exemplified in detail. However, maintaining an open and impartial attitude, eliminating unnecessary entanglements and obstacles, and developing and expanding the original revolutionary spirit is the way to fundamentally cure the disease. This is the second point. This war of resistance, when explained in terms of the various aspects of the nation, both internally and externally, is full of the meaning of reforming and innovating. Even various social undertakings and the personal establishment and career of any individual will face serious tests and undergo drastic changes due to the war of resistance. This is due to the trend of events and is almost unavoidable. It can be seen that the excellent will be reasonably developed, and the corrupt will be reasonably eliminated. If artificial interference is added to it, although the final destination cannot fundamentally violate the trend, the transitional phenomena created will vary depending on whether the artificial interference is appropriate. Those who plan for the nation should clearly recognize this great trend and guide it in a favorable direction. In other words, we must work hard to make all reforms, successes, failures, rises, falls, profits, and losses extremely fair, extremely economical, and extremely clear. If the effort is appropriate, it can shorten the process of completing the great cause of national construction. Conversely, it will only increase obstacles. The impact is far-reaching and cannot be described in words. However, climbing high starts from the low, and traveling far starts from the near. Everything begins now. Therefore, planning for the party and the nation now must at least examine reality and eliminate any unfair, uneconomical, and unclear matters towards people and events. Only by eliminating them without mercy can reasonable measures be taken. This is the third point. Will the Fifth Plenary Session pay attention to these three points?</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bombing Near Chongqing, Dropping Leaflets to Propagandize to the People in Support of Wang Jingwei's Peace Movement, This Is the Beginning of Hiranuma's Attack on China</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Yesterday, twenty-four Japanese planes bombed Yichang at around 12:00 noon, and then split into two groups to fly to Chongqing, bombing the suburbs and nearby areas of Chongqing, and dropping leaflets to propagandize to the people to support Wang Jingwei's peace movement. It is understood that there were sixteen Japanese planes flying to Chongqing, but due to heavy fog, it was impossible to confirm the exact number. Today, observers pointed out that the Japanese planes' bombing of Chongqing today is the beginning of Hiranuma's attack on China. As for the war, there is activity on all fronts. According to a Central News Agency report, Japan occupied the counties of Daning and Ningxiang in southwestern Shanxi, attempting to cross the river and invade northern Shaanxi at the above-mentioned locations. According to another Central News Agency report, two divisions of Japanese troops left Nagasaki for Taiwan on the first day of the new year. At the same time, there were also eight transport ships, four destroyers, and one aircraft carrier, carrying many airplanes. The purpose is unknown. (Associated Press telegram, August 8)</p>
<p>Twenty-four Japanese planes bombed near Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the 7th. Yichang was also affected. Chongqing had not been bombed by Japanese planes for the past two months. In this bombing, no bombs landed in the city of Chongqing. (Associated Press telegram, August 8)</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Special Budget; Parliament Reopens on the 22nd; Arita to Clarify Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch, 7th: The cabinet decided to meet daily until the 11th, and after the 11th, meetings will be held as usual. Also, in the 7th cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Ishiwata first gave a detailed explanation of the special accounting budget for the 14th year of Showa (1939), and then the original plan was passed without objection. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch, According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, when the parliament reconvenes on the 21st, Foreign Minister Arita will elaborate on Japan's diplomatic policy, and will also touch upon the note sent by the U.S. government to Japan on December 31st of last year. The Japanese government believes that now is not the time to formally reply to the U.S. government's note, so the Foreign Minister must wait until the parliament reconvenes before mentioning the U.S. note incident. The Japanese government must thoroughly study the reactions in the United States after President Roosevelt's speech in Congress on the 3rd, and the reactions after Arita's speech in Congress in the future, before it can reply to the United States in the form of a memorandum. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch, The Japanese government has decided that in this cabinet, the Minister of Justice, Shiono, will concurrently serve as Minister of Colonial Affairs, and the Minister of Commerce, Hatta, will concurrently serve as Minister of Development.

(8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo Dispatch, The Tokyo stock market has not shown any reaction to the news that Britain and the United States will take economic retaliatory measures.

<h3>Japanese Economy Facing Imminent Crisis; Currency Devaluation Implemented; People's Livelihood Burden Increases</h3>
<p>London, The well-known British weekly "The Observer" recently published an article entitled "Japan Can Endure Suffering." It states that as the undeclared war between China and Japan enters its second year, the domestic economic situation in Japan, and even the lifeblood of the empire, is clearly about to face serious worries. The deadline set by generally well-informed people has long passed. Anyone who knows the situation in Japan will not be surprised that its collapse may occur. The intensification of industrial production and the increase in the suffering of workers are affecting the people's energy and the quality of production. The decline in the standard of living in the years before the war has now fallen to the point where the Japanese masses, including farmers, can barely make a living. The decline of technical personnel has resulted in a large reduction in the import of war materials urgently needed by Japan. Ordinary industries have suffered great losses due to the lack of raw materials and the heavy pressure of government control. In the first half of 1938, Japan's cotton output fell by 20%, and the output of rayon only reached 30% of the previous year. Although the Japanese yen is nominally worth two shillings, it has actually been devalued and is only worth ten pence on the foreign market. The report concludes that, from this point of view, the approach of a financial and economic crisis in Japan is inevitable. (8th Quick News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Concession Negotiations Remain Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Tianjin Dispatch, Negotiations between the Japanese army in Tianjin and the authorities of the British and French concessions remain deadlocked. The Japanese demands are extremely unreasonable, such as recognizing that the concession police are all anti-Japanese elements and must be reorganized, and insisting that anyone the Japanese designate to be arrested must be dealt with immediately. The concession authorities have not agreed to this, but have discussed it several times, so the future trend is highly noteworthy. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Unrest in Rangoon; Military and Police Rush to Action</h3>
<p>Rangoon, The military and police here were issued emergency orders today and simultaneously dispatched because a large number of striking workers, around a thousand, are advancing towards this city. Within five weeks, these striking workers have stayed in the border areas, and after departing three hundred and seventy-five miles, they will petition the Rangoon authorities for grievances, and are expected to enter this city this morning. Order has already been disrupted by the general striking workers, because a large number of university students are also mobilized to protest against the detention policies implemented by the Burmese government. These striking workers are all holding communist flags, and the police are on special alert to prevent accidents. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany Promotes Mulberry Planting and Sericulture; Objective Achievements in Four Years</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin Air Dispatch: The German weather is not suitable for mulberry planting and silkworm rearing, but in recent years, the German government has tried its best to enable the silk produced domestically to supply a portion of its needs. Since 1934, the achievements in silk production have progressed extremely rapidly. The output of cocoons has increased fivefold, and the number of mulberry trees has increased twenty-twofold compared to four years ago. Following this progress, the future is unlimited.</p>
<p>The German "Attack" newspaper claims that since Japan has blockaded British positions in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, Britain is now changing its approach and entering China through the back door via Rangoon. Britain's recent loan to China is for this purpose. According to the newspaper's Rangoon dispatch, British ships loaded with munitions have arrived there to supply China. The first batch of military supplies included twenty-two trucks. The mountains of Yunnan Province are precipitous, and although Japan has bombers, they cannot harm Yunnan Province. This progress is a revolution in the Far East, and also a new starting point in the Sino-Japanese War. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, A large number of new weapons have arrived, strengthening the country's strength. Cars and all equipment purchased with credit loans from Britain are on the way, and if there are no obstacles in transportation, the first batch can arrive within a month, and more will continue to arrive. The waterways of Sichuan and Guangxi have begun to be dredged to facilitate the wartime military transport. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xikang, Newly Established Province, Formerly Regarded as a Remote and Desolate Area; Now Undertakes Important Tasks in the Rear Area of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>The establishment of Xikang Province was realized on New Year's Day this year. It was formerly regarded as a remote and desolate area, but now it is actually a key point on the western border and bears important responsibilities in the rear of the War of Resistance. Now, a general report on the situation in Xikang Province is presented as follows:</p>
<p>Xikang is one of China's eight major plateaus, with many high mountains and deep valleys. It borders Sichuan to the east, Yunnan, British Burma, and India to the south, Gansu and Qinghai to the north, and Tibet to the west. The total area is 2,046,000 square miles, but the population is sparse. The total population of the province is only 3,800,500, of which 600,000 are Han Chinese, 1,300,000 are Tibetan, 1,700,000 are Kang, and the rest are Mongolian, etc., in very small numbers.</p>
<p>Xikang is surrounded by the high mountains and deep valleys of the Hengduan Mountains. The so-called Hengduan Mountains are composed of the Selongla Range and the Boshula Range branching out from the Gangga Li Mountains, the southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, the Tanian Ta Weng Mountains and the Yunling Mountains branching out from the Tanggula Mountains, and the Shaluli Range and the Daxue Mountains branching out from the Bayan Har Mountains. In addition to these six main lines of the Hengduan Mountains, there are also the Min Mountains in the southeast and the Wuding Mountains in the southwest. The main rivers include the Yarlung Tsangpo River, the Bo Tsangpo River, the En River, the Lancang River, the Jinsha River, the Yalong River, and the Dadu River. The Yarlung Tsangpo River originates in Tibet and flows into British India's Assam region. The Bo Tsangpo River originates in Jiali County in this province and flows into British Burma. The Nu River originates in the plateau north of Lhasa, flows through this province into Yunnan, and then flows into Burma. The Lancang River originates in the south of Qinghai, passes through this province into Yunnan, and then enters French Vietnam. The Jinsha River is the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, between Batang in this province and Xufu in Sichuan. The Yalong River is the Xiaojinsha River, originating from the southern foot of the Bayan Har Mountains and flowing south parallel to the Dajinsha River, joining the Dajinsha River west of Huili in Sichuan. The Dadu River originates from the southern foot of the Min River and meanders through Sichuan and Xikang provinces. Xikang is located in a semi-tropical zone and is slightly affected by the monsoon. Unfortunately, due to the high terrain, the climate is inevitably cold, but it also varies from place to place. For example, Kangding is very high above sea level, and the cold is particularly severe, while Ba'an is lower in altitude, and the temperature is moderate.</p>
<p>Xikang's resources are primarily mineral deposits. For example, the Mike gold mine in Zhanhua is famous for its high quality. The coal seam in Qamdo is as deep as 7,000 feet and as high as 600 feet. Ningjing produces abundant petroleum, and the British and Russians have investigated it. Tongpu, Dege, and its surrounding areas produce bronze and brass, while Kangding and Ba'an produce iron. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation and the superstition of the locals, although there was some mining in the late Qing Dynasty, the quantity was still very small. Agriculture is not very developed due to the high terrain and cold climate. Only the valleys and depressions can be slightly cultivated. The main crops are wheat, corn, and oats, followed by potatoes and beans. Rice is very scarce. Animal husbandry is quite suitable due to the vast grasslands, with yaks being the largest, followed by horses. Musk grows in the navel sacs of male musk deer, and the yield is extremely high. A large quantity is exported abroad every year. Forest products are also abundant, mainly pine and fir. Xikang is adjacent to Tibet and was originally the Kham region of Tibet, but Xikang has its own historical and inherited fixed area and cannot be mixed with Tibet. The name Xikang first appeared in the Later Han Dynasty. Zhuge Liang's expedition to the southern barbarians reached this place. Guiwang of the late Ming Dynasty was also exiled to Xikang. However, from the Tang Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, Ming Dynasty, to the Qing Dynasty, the method of governing Xikang was only to appoint its chieftains with a policy of appeasement, so that the locals only knew about Xikang and did not know about China. In the 30th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, after the British-Tibetan treaty was established, the Qing government realized that the boundary between Kang and Tibet could not but be urgently planned, and the method of governance could not be merely appeasement. In the 32nd year, the Minister of Frontier Affairs of Sichuan and Yunnan was established, with Zhao Erfeng appointed. Zhao managed Xikang for five or six years, striving to build, reclaim wasteland, establish schools, and reform the administration, in order to achieve long-term stability. The scale was roughly established, but the Qing Dynasty was overthrown. After the establishment of the Republic of China, 33 counties on the Sichuan border were designated as special regions. In the 7th year of the Republic of China, the Tibetan army attacked and captured nine counties including Dege and Ningjing. Only thirteen counties remained. In the 20th year, Ganzhi and Zhanhua were invaded and occupied by Tibetan bandits, half of Yanjing was lost, and Ba'an was also on the verge of danger several times. It was not until the 21st year of the Republic of China that the Sichuan-Kang army recovered Ganzhi, Zhanhua, Dege, Baiyu, Dengke, and other counties. In October of the same year, Liu Wenhui, the commander-in-chief of the Sichuan-Kang army, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet each sent commissioners for negotiations, and a ceasefire agreement was signed in Gangtuo, Dege. It stipulated that the area east of the Jinsha River would be managed by the Han side, and the area west would be managed by the Tibetan side. The dispute between Kang and Tibet has come to an end for now, but the lost areas have not been fully recovered. The proposal to establish Xikang Province has been circulating for a long time, and it has finally been established. The development plans for the future have already been detailed in the declaration of establishment issued by the Xikang Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister's Visit to Italy Imminent; Wide Range of Talks; Germany and Italy Both Advocate for a Four-Power Conference to Discuss Mediterranean Issues</h3>
<p>Berlin, As British Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to visit Italy, German political figures all hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain will persuade the French authorities to agree to hold a four-power conference of Germany, France, Italy, and Britain to discuss various issues in the Mediterranean. It is said that in order to implement its demands, Italy may cause clashes in the border areas adjacent to French and Italian territories, and then mobilize its navy, which is not impossible. Prime Minister Chamberlain is deeply concerned that Germany may take action to assist Italy, and will naturally persuade France to participate in the four-power conference. In this way, Germany can also take the opportunity to raise colonial demands at the conference. German political figures hope so, but experienced observers say that if serious conflicts actually occur between France and Italy, Germany may not use force to assist Italy. Perhaps, if Germany believes that the dispute between France and Italy is enough to cause armed conflict, it may even refuse to fully support Italy's demands. In short, what Germany hopes for is that Britain will mediate between France and Italy. That is all. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, When the British Prime Minister and others visit Rome, the Italian people will definitely give them a warm welcome. All streets will be hung with British flags. Although the official arrangements only include one meeting between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, according to the opinions of political observers, there will definitely be more than one meeting, and the scope of the talks will involve all international events. Italian newspapers also predicted the possibility of holding a four-power conference to discuss Italian demands, saying that the entire issue of the relationship between Germany and Italy and Britain and France will be considered based on the new balance of power created by the Munich Agreement. As for smaller issues related to Britain and Italy, such as the new commercial negotiations scheduled in the Anglo-Italian agreement, the final demarcation of the boundaries of African Anglo-Italian territories, and the future status of the Mediterranean, will also be discussed. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, The news that British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will stay briefly in Paris on their way to Rome has aroused hopes among people here that Britain will mediate the dispute between Italy and France. The Roman People's Newspaper stated that this move is a slap in the face of France's claim not to accept mediation. According to international etiquette, the British Prime Minister and others would not accept France's request without first notifying the country that invited them to visit and obtaining its consent. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet to be Reorganized Next Month; Nature and Scope Depend on Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>London, Political figures here recently declared that the British cabinet will be reorganized next month. The nature and scope will depend on the outcome of the talks between Prime Minister Chamberlain and the Italian authorities. In other words, if the Prime Minister can persuade Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to earnestly support the appeasement policy and obtain various economic benefits in exchange, then radical figures such as former Foreign Secretary Eden will not join the cabinet. Conversely, if the Prime Minister's trip is unsuccessful, he will only adopt a tough policy towards Germany and Italy. In that case, Eden's return to the cabinet is undoubtedly certain. Moreover, if the cabinet is reorganized, the ministers in charge of departments related to national defense must be reshuffled. For example, Minister for the Coordination of Defence Inskip will likely be removed from his post. If the Prime Minister's appeasement policy fails, the government may change the national voluntary service system to a compulsory one. At that time, a special department will definitely be established, and Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, who advocates the most vehemently for compulsory service, will be transferred to be the minister of that department. In addition, it is well known that Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson has criticized the slow progress of the military expansion plan. Whether he will remain in office will also depend on how the diplomatic situation develops. The reassignment of Minister of Agriculture Morrison to another position is expected.

<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Receives British and American Ambassadors</h3>
<p>Rome, Official sources recently declared that when Foreign Minister Ciano received U.S. Ambassador Phillips today, he informed him that President Roosevelt's personal letter to Prime Minister Mussolini regarding the Jewish resettlement issue is being studied by the Italian government in a friendly spirit. There was no other indication. British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine also visited Foreign Minister Ciano today to discuss the arrangements for the reception of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax.

<h3>French Premier Returns to Paris; Meets President Lebrun; Reports on Tour</h3>
<p>Paris, Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier arrived here at 9:18 this morning. When he got out of the car, he smiled and embraced Cabinet Secretary Xu Dan, Minister of the Navy, who welcomed him at the station. Then he delivered a broadcast speech on the platform, saying, "I am very pleased to have witnessed the loyalty and close unity of the natives of Algeria and Tunisia to the motherland." They also hope that French compatriots will become more united to carry out the great task at hand." When the Premier walked out of the station, a large crowd cheered and paid tribute to him. He then visited President Lebrun at 10:50 to report on his trip. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris, French Premier Daladier, on his way back to Paris, passed through Valence and gave a brief speech at the local town hall, defending his position in the Munich Agreement and earnestly explaining to all countries in the world that France has not been divided by it. His actions in Munich were aimed at protecting France and preventing the world from suffering from war. Daladier solemnly declared that if the French want peace, they must first unite, because if France is once disintegrated internally, it will inevitably be exploited by the enemy. He also refuted the rumors spread by foreign newspapers that civil war was about to break out in France, saying that the country spreading such rumors clearly has ambitions to covet France's territory in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Daladier continued, "As soon as I return to Paris, I will devote all my efforts to national affairs, and I will never allow the various rumors to become a reality. I believe that maintaining the security and order of France and its territories is the best policy to protect the French Republic and world democracy." (8th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Situation on Hungarian-Czech Border Remains Tense; Czech Troops Continue to Attack Ancheng; Hungary Dispatches Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Budapest, After the incident in Mongács in the north, it returned to calm yesterday afternoon. Another serious incident occurred in Nagygéjőc near Ungvár. A team of regular Czech troops, together with Ukrainian guerrillas, attacked the area at 9:00 last night. (Note: Ungvár, originally named Uzhhorod, is the capital of the Czechoslovak Carpathian Ruthenia province, which was decided to be assigned to Hungary by the Vienna Award). Upon hearing the news, the Hungarian authorities have dispatched reinforcements to defend the area. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest, The situation near Mongács remains tense. According to news received from the Hungarian side, Czech troops continue to concentrate in the area. In addition, an incident also occurred today in the Hungarian border town of Kolda (not far from the border with the Czechoslovak province). A resident of the town named Lipenszky was arrested for insulting Hungarian Regent Horthy. More than 150 people immediately held a demonstration to protest. Hungarian gendarmes opened fire, killing three people. The situation was quite serious. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest, According to news from the Hungarian official news agency, new movements of Czech troops were discovered yesterday near Krasztolmas in the vicinity of Munkácsy. The Czechs are also transporting beams and planks, apparently intending to build a bridge over the Latorica River in order to transport troops to Várkulcsa. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest, Regarding the Mongács incident, after the conflict between Czech and Hungarian military forces yesterday, seven people were killed on the Hungarian side, including four officers, and nine people were injured. On the Czech side, one customs officer and three soldiers were killed. Their bodies were found in Hungarian territory, and soldiers and enemies were captured and detained in Mongács. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest, The four Hungarians killed in the Mongács shooting incident will reportedly be given a state funeral. Among the nine injured, some were injured by stray bullets. Three citizens and two girls and one child are still in Mongács recovering. (8th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Prague, A communiqué was issued here yesterday stating that the Czech-Hungarian Mixed Commission is currently investigating the Mongács conflict. The first meeting was held yesterday afternoon. The Czech government has instructed that a detailed investigation be conducted into the causes and consequences of the incident. At the same time, it believes that the two governments should take this opportunity to study various trends in a spirit of friendly cooperation in order to appease the border and prevent the recurrence of such conflicts. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Prague, Regarding the Mongács incident, a semi-official communiqué stated that the area has returned to calm since 5:00 pm yesterday. The Autonomous Government of Carpathian Ruthenia has dispatched Lieutenant Lugaš, a liaison officer, to assist the joint committee composed of Czech and Hungarian officers in conducting the investigation. In addition, the military authorities also issued a communiqué on the incident, stating that near the border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the vicinity of the city of Mongács, Hungarian army units assisted by armed people opened fire on Czech army units on January 6. By the afternoon, after intervention by liaison officers from both sides, the firing stopped, and the respective troops returned to their original defenses along the border. The joint committee composed of Czech and Hungarian officers investigated the situation yesterday afternoon in the hope of finding an appropriate solution. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Czech-Hungarian Disputes Cause Unease in Germany; Italy Openly Favors Hungary</h3>
<p>Berlin, Regarding the repeated disputes between the Czech and Hungarian borders, German political figures now feel uneasy about the tendency of the Czechs to allow the Slovaks to be self-governing. (Note: The German side no longer looks favorably on the Slovaks. Newspapers have recently reported that the Slovak Autonomous Government discriminates against Germans.) Newspapers originally stated that Hungary should bear the responsibility for the Mongács incident, but now they have changed their tune and attributed the responsibility to the Czech government. The Essener National Zeitung stated, "Communism is still active in Czech territory. This fact is not in line with the spirit of understanding between Germany and the Czech Republic." (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, The German semi-official newspaper "Political and Foreign Correspondence" reported that the German government has issued warnings to both the Czech and Hungarian governments, and expressed Germany's attitude towards the Mongács incident. It is said that the authorities in any region must calm the people and maintain normality at the beginning of such incidents, and must take appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of the same incidents. The newspaper believes that the misfortune of this incident stems from the fact that people on all sides have different opinions on the recent revision of the border, and continue to promote demands to change the border. In fact, this kind of propaganda not only violates the solemn official guarantees, but also has the potential to create waves and cause international conflicts. This trend must not be allowed to grow. No matter how the rumors spread, the Vienna Awards have become ironclad cases. The new borders between Hungary and Czechia have been set, and no one should cross the border to make trouble. (8th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, Foreign Minister Ciano received Hungarian Minister Vilany today to discuss the Mongács incident. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, Italian newspapers' reports on the Mongács incident, judging from their headlines, clearly favored Hungary, and disclosed the Hungarian communiqué in more detail than the Czech communiqué, but did not make any criticisms. The same is true for officialdom. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Government Urges Britain and France to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Budapest, The Hungarian government has instructed its ambassadors to Britain and France to draw the attention of the governments of their host countries to the Czech army's attack on Mongács. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Policy: Guaranteeing Border Security, Allowing Germany to Expand into Southeastern Europe; German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The Berlin Danzig Post, known for reflecting the views of the German authorities, recently commented on Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's talks with Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden, saying, "Although the political situation in Eastern and Southeastern Europe has changed significantly in the past year, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact signed in 1934 remains a useful tool for stabilizing relations between the two countries. This has been confirmed by Foreign Minister Beck's visit, and the German authorities are very satisfied with this." Regarding the talks between the German and Polish authorities, German newspapers have commented on this as their first decision. German political figures say that Polish foreign policy focuses on defending the country's border security with Germany, while allowing Germany to freely expand into Southeastern Europe, and it is gratifying that they still adhere to this policy. However, one thing is regrettable, namely, that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently advised Hungary to reconcile with Germany, but the Polish government did not support this. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, after holding talks with Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Munich, Germany, yesterday, returned here with his wife tonight. German Ambassador to Poland, Moltke, who participated in the talks in Munich, will return to his post tomorrow. Regarding the content of the talks, Polish officials remain tight-lipped and refuse to comment. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hamburg Civil Affairs Director Delivers Speech on Foreign Policy Issues</h3>
<p>Hamburg, Germany: Hamburg Civil Affairs Director Kauffmann recently delivered a speech on foreign policy issues, stating that 1938 was Germany's year of expansion in Europe. The policies promoted by Führer Hitler have been successful. The Munich Agreement was established with much effort from British Prime Minister Chamberlain, but Führer Hitler's contribution was the greatest. Although this agreement has produced an atmosphere of tranquility, anti-German forces within various democracies continue to grow. "Excluding the Soviet Union, the United States is the strongest of these forces." Finally, regarding the Jewish question, he said that this matter urgently needs to be resolved. Cooperation with relevant countries is needed to intensify resettlement efforts on a clear and legal basis. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hungary Promotes a Lifestyle Movement, Implements Social Reforms to Promote National Unity</h3>
<p>Budapest: Regarding the request of the German minority in Hungary for the right to promote National Socialism, their leader, Basch, will discuss it with Prime Minister Imrédy in the near future. (It is reported that there are over one million Germans in Hungary, about half of whom have assimilated to varying degrees with Hungarians.) To preemptively address this issue, Prime Minister Imrédy gave a speech on the 6th of this month, announcing the formation of the "Hungarian Lifestyle Movement," intended to unite government factions to resist Germanism. This movement will be chaired by Army Minister General Rátz, non-cabinet member de Losonczi, and former cabinet member Homann. Its main goal is to promote Hungarian national unity from a racial perspective. According to the Prime Minister's speech, this movement advocates for the implementation of "wise and prudent social reforms," stating that it "aims to overcome poverty, not to fight against assets." Furthermore, it advocates treating all minorities well, and has promised various preferential treatments to the German minority, such as: establishing German-language schools in German-populated areas; using German in administrative agencies and courts at all levels; and establishing a committee under the central government to handle minority affairs. As for the German minority's request to promote National Socialism, although their leader Basch will submit it for discussion with Prime Minister Imrédy in the future, according to Berlin's wishes, the Prime Minister has not yet agreed to it. In addition, the majority of the German minority is engaged in farming and is extremely indifferent to politics, often hindering Basch's efforts to promote a totalitarian system. Therefore, the German community itself shows little concern regarding promoting National Socialism. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Comparison of Air Force Strengths Among Major European and American Powers</h3>
<p>London: The Sunday Times today published an article by an aviation correspondent stating that records circulating in Washington regarding comparisons of European air force strengths, said to represent the views of well-informed circles, are inaccurate and exaggerated by the authoritarian countries. At the time of the Munich Agreement, the rumored number of aircraft in each country was as follows: Germany 10,000, Italy 3,500, Britain 1,500, France 600, and the United States 1,700. However, according to information he obtained that has been verified from multiple sources, the actual number of aircraft in each country at the end of September was: Germany 3,200, Italy 1,750, France 1,150, and Britain 2,200. Moreover, the differences are now close to becoming significantly smaller. British authorities believe that the excellence of their regular and reserve air force pilots far surpasses that of any other country. The correspondent concluded by saying that he believes that the total number of deaths due to accidents among personnel in the British Royal Air Force and students in civilian flight schools is 219, which is only one-fourth of the death rate of the German Air Force and students.

<p>Washington: After President Roosevelt's message to Congress evoked a positive response in domestic and international opinion, the government felt encouraged and has prepared to submit a bill to Congress, requesting authorization for the government to take economic retaliatory measures against any country that imposes discriminatory treatment on American interests or discriminatory treatment on American citizens based on race or religion, with the primary intention of dealing with Japan and Germany. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to Congressman Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Rear Admiral Hepburn's report on expanding naval bases in the Pacific will be recommended by the committee to Congress, and the naval bases listed in the report will be established separately. Congress has also stated that it will formulate legislation based on the report. Rear Admiral Hepburn's report advocated that the United States should defend the Philippines by establishing air and submarine bases at key points in the central Pacific and greatly expanding the air and submarine base on Guam. According to naval officials, this plan was previously considered, but was temporarily suspended for fear of provoking a reaction from Japan. Rear Admiral Hepburn's report was drafted by a committee of naval experts chaired by Hepburn. The strengthening of Guam's defenses demonstrates their determination to defend the Philippines. The report advocated that the air base on Wake Island should have the capacity to accommodate a reconnaissance aircraft squadron and should be equipped with docks and shipyards. Similar facilities should also be built on Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Canton Island, and Rose Island. In Alaska, three second-class naval bases should be built, such as a submarine base on Kodiak Island and a naval activity base in Unalaska. Air and naval bases should also be added in the Atlantic and Caribbean. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Urges Democratic Party Unity; Celebrates Independence War Anniversary with Banquet</h3>
<p>Washington: Former US President Jackson (a Democrat) served as a general during the War of Independence and defeated the British army in New Orleans on January 8, 1815. Today is the 124th anniversary, and over 10,000 Democrats across the country held banquets last night to celebrate. President Roosevelt, Attorney General Murphy, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, Acting Secretary of War Johnson, Governor Rivers of Georgia, and Governor Chandler of Kentucky all delivered speeches. President Roosevelt also called for Democratic Party unity, saying, "If we Democrats can help each other, then the American people will surely support our party in the 1940 election. The Republican Party had a minor victory in last year's congressional elections. The way to respond is to make those Republicans who are混跡 in our party and plotting against us return to their party, strengthen internal unity, and absorb members of other parties and non-partisans who believe in liberalism." In addition, President Roosevelt said that if former President Jackson were still alive, he would definitely use wireless telephone to tell him, "You are the first person since former President Theodore Roosevelt to be re-elected twice without interruption and to maintain a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Republicans had a small victory, so why fear?" The banquet fees paid by Democrats in various places ranged from $25 to $100 and were all used to supplement party expenses. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Democratic Senator Proposes Digging New Canal in Nicaragua; Militarily Important</h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Bland, a Democrat from Virginia and chairman of the House Merchant Marine Committee, recently submitted a proposal to the House of Representatives, advocating the excavation of a canal in the Republic of Nicaragua in Central America or the widening of the Panama Canal. The discussion of opening a canal in Nicaragua was mentioned once several years ago. This is the first time that members of Congress have paid attention to this, which is worthy of importance. Regarding this plan, the New York Times published an article in early December of last year, stating that this river is 276 kilometers long and requires an expenditure of $725,000,000. American military authorities believe that the Panama Canal is easily damaged in wartime, and this new canal is of great military importance and needs to be opened. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hull Advises Arms Dealers Not to Be Accomplices; Arms Control Committee Submits Report</h3>
<p>Washington: The Arms Control Committee recently submitted a report to Congress, stating that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, there have been numerous merchants who disregarded the neutrality law and tried to secretly transport arms to Spain, and they have all been stopped. However, forty "Grumman" aircraft were able to be transported to the Spanish Republican government via Canada and France using forged documents, and another ten were shipped via Mexico. In addition, twenty-two aircraft engines and twenty-four 37mm anti-aircraft guns could not be shipped because the State Department refused to issue export permits. Since January 8, 1937, the Spanish Nationalist Army has not received any arms supplies in the United States. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull, due to Japanese aircraft bombing civilians in China and Spanish Nationalist Army aircraft bombing civilians in Republican-held territory, pressured arms dealers and advised them not to sell aircraft and bombs to those countries. All but the largest arms factory have agreed to comply. (Havas Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Arab King's Cry of Injustice; Independence Dashed by Broken Promises of Major Powers; Blames US for Protecting Jews</h3>
<p>Cairo: The protest letter from Arab King Ibn Saud to President Roosevelt, which was revealed yesterday, is as follows:</p>
<p>The people and government of the United States are influenced by extensive Jewish propaganda and have prejudices regarding the Palestinian issue, believing that Jewish oppression of Arabs is a righteous act worthy of support, not knowing that in fact, it is causing peaceful Arabs to suffer unfair treatment. Furthermore, he said that when the European War began, Arabs hoped to gain independence and freedom by joining the Allied Powers in the war. After the war ended, Arabs believed they could achieve independence based on the following reasons: Arabs participated in the Great War, sacrificing countless lives and property; the British government had an official document promising Arab independence; US President Wilson advised the Arabs to wage war in Mecca to obtain the right to national self-determination; when the Allied Powers occupied Arabia in November 1918, they declared in an official document that they were seeking Arab independence and freedom; and President Wilson publicly promised the right of national self-determination to the Arabs in his declaration on the Near East in 1919. However, after the war ended, the major powers went back on their promises and turned a blind eye. The territory of the Arabs was divided, and extremely unnatural boundaries were hastily drawn. Injustice in the world had reached this point. But there was worse to come. The major powers transferred the rights and interests of the Arabs to the Jews. If a race with a culture and way of life incompatible with the Arabs is allowed to occupy the homeland of the Arabs, and all the homeless people in the world are sent here, then how can there be hope for the restoration of peace in Palestine? Palestine has been sacrificed for the Jewish question. Now, please find a vast and boundless territory, open up and accommodate the Jews, instead of gratuitously granting what belongs to others, only singing high-sounding tunes. (Haitong Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Jerusalem: Terrorist Activities Show Signs of Resurgence; Over 4,000 Arrested</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Terrorist activities show signs of resurgence. Military and political authorities have intensified their suppression and have arrested many rebels in the northern and central regions, especially in the cities of Nazareth and Tulkarm. The total number of arrests is over 4,500, and they have all been detained in ten concentration camps. The Sarafand Camp alone detains 1,000 prisoners. The government authorities have issued an order stating that residents who have left the country without a passport or whose passports have expired and are still staying abroad will have their Palestinian citizenship revoked. As for Arab rebels, they attack Jews and Britons on the one hand, and also attack members of their own race who are designated as "enemies of the rebellion." For example, bandits are one such case. Many houses owned by the notorious bandit Fakhri Abdul Hadi and two shops in Nablus have been burned. Three Arab residents of Nazareth have been kidnapped. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Syria Demands Independence; Mass Demonstrations; Stores Closed</h3>
<p>Syria: The treaty signed between France and Syria in September 1936, which stipulated that Syria would regain independence three years after the treaty went into effect, has been rejected by the French parliament. Mass demonstrations broke out in major cities in Syria today, demanding independence and opposing the abandonment of this treaty. Department stores in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, and Hama were all closed, and crowds gathered in the streets to participate in the demonstrations. Students from high schools and above in Damascus marched in teams, demanding independence. 600 students in Aleppo marched in teams, urging citizens to go to the mosques to listen to political speeches. Authorities in various places have taken necessary measures to maintain order. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>First German Battleship Built After World War I Enters Fleet Service; Displacement of 26,000 Tons, Equipped with 35 Guns</h3>
<p>Wilhelmshaven, Germany: The newly built German armored cruiser "Scharnhorst," the first warship of its kind built in Germany since World War I, was incorporated into the fleet at noon today. The ship has a displacement of 26,000 tons, a length of 226 meters, a width of 30 meters, a draft of 7.5 meters, a speed of 27 knots per hour, and a crew of 1,460 officers and men.

<h3>Mexico Compensates British Oil Company for Losses</h3>
<p>Mexico City: Mexican Foreign Minister Hay yesterday presented a check for £15,000 to the Danish Minister, representing the British Embassy, to compensate for the losses suffered by the British due to the confiscation of British oil properties during the Mexican Revolution. This is the amount determined by the Joint Committee of Arbitration to be paid annually. Thus, Mexico's debt for the confiscation of British oil companies has been cleared. The Mexican government also delivered checks to the French and Italian representatives to clear the debts due from the Mexican government this year. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>British and French Sympathizers with Spanish Republican Government; British Peace Group Leader Urges Italy to Abandon Interference; French Congressional Representative Willing to Find Ways to Supply Food</h3>
<p>London: Four hundred representatives of the international peace movement, led by the Duchess of Atholl, marched to 10 Downing Street and presented Prime Minister Chamberlain with a resolution on the future Rome talks. The resolution requested that the government clearly announce to Mussolini that if Italy continues to interfere in the Spanish war, the British people's friendly relations with Italy will not be maintained. The resolution opposed granting belligerent rights to General Franco and advocated granting full international rights to the Spanish government. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: A delegation from the French Parliament came to inspect the territory held by the Republican government and was received by members of the Spanish Parliament. Mr. Andé Dantin, Deputy of the French Radical Socialist Party, delivered a speech, saying, "After we return to our country, we will do everything in our power to assist your country in an effective way. For example, the food supply issue must be resolved immediately. There is a shortage of bread, milk, and potatoes in the territory held by your Republican government, while France has a surplus, which can be adjusted. In addition, we must also ask our government to end the despicable, hypocritical, and one-sided non-intervention policy. In other words, if a genuine non-intervention policy cannot be established, then we will give the most effective assistance to your Republican government, which is consistent with the ideals of us republicans and in line with the aspirations of us French to defend our homeland."

<h3>San Francisco Bombing Case; Labor Leader Proclaims Injustice Rectified; 22 Years of Imprisonment; Released with Gray Hair</h3>
<p>Sacramento, California: Labor leader Mooney, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the San Francisco bombing case on July 22, 1916, was acquitted and released today due to the inauguration of the new Governor Olson. It is said that 22 years ago, the US military pursued Pancho Villa and mistakenly entered Mexican territory, causing public outrage among Mexicans. As a result, a bomb was placed in a trunk at a street corner in San Francisco, which exploded, killing ten passersby and injuring forty. Mooney, as a labor activist, was falsely accused, sentenced to death, and then commuted to life imprisonment. During these 22 years, officials repeatedly tried to release him, but he refused. When Mooney left prison today, his black hair had turned white. Governor Olson first summoned Mooney to the state Capitol, announced to the legislature, "I firmly believe that Mooney is innocent and that his imprisonment was purely due to false accusations and perjury, so I advocate his release. If anyone opposes the release, please present new evidence immediately." After the governor finished speaking, the whole scene was silent, and no one raised any objections. The governor then declared, "I will now sign the release order for Mr. Mooney," and immediately signed the certificate and handed it to Mooney. His wife was also on the scene, extremely happy and weeping. Mooney also said to the governor, "You uphold justice, and I am extremely grateful." It is also heard that Governor Olson is planning to release Mr. Billings, who was sentenced at the same time as Mooney, but Billings has two convictions, so his release must first be approved by the Supreme Court. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Sacramento: Labor leader Mooney, who was imprisoned in connection with the San Francisco bombing case in 1917, has spent twenty-two years in prison and was finally pardoned today. According to a broadcast speech given by Mooney tonight, he will fight against the Fascists to the end, and the most effective way to fight is to organize workers across the country to fight together. He said, "I deeply understand the significance of my release today. I have been fighting for twenty-two and a half years, hoping to redress my grievances... Even today, I can still recall the situation when I was sentenced in court, and the impression is extremely deep. My old mother cried out in pain, and my sister-in-law and colleagues were all in mourning. I deeply know that a certain force is not only fighting against us in California, but the whole world has suffered its adverse effects. There is no more effective way to fight against the fascist forces of today than with the economic organization of workers. It can be asserted that we should gather all our strength and strive to transform society with a common goal. We are responsible for rebuilding a good social order so that each member of society benefits each other and does not exploit each other." At the same time, Mooney thanked Governor Olsen and stated that he would try to get his fellow prisoner, Billings, released as well. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>

<h3>Amber Increasingly Used in Germany; Inlaid in Daily Necessities, Very Popular</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 8th (Airmail)</p>
<p>Amber ornaments, known in Germany as "German gold," have become increasingly popular in Germany in recent years, and are used creatively to decorate and embellish. Amber is abundant in the Baltic Sea coastal areas and has been used for ornaments for thousands of years. At a recent exhibition in Hanover, objects such as chains, bowls, cups, and sword hilts were inlaid with amber. Amber is also a commercial product similar to rosin. When ground into powder, it can be used to manufacture paints and other items. Amber bowls also have special uses in medicine because they can prevent blood from clotting when used to hold it.</p>
<h3>European Funds Flow Back to the United States</h3>
<p>Washington: The Treasury Department recently announced that capital flowing from the United States to foreign countries totaled $374,547,000 in the first half of last year. From June to September in the second half of last year, however, $407,066,000美允 returned to the United States. The reason for this is likely due to the tense situation in Europe in September. As for the flow of capital between the United States and France, American capital flowing to France in the first half of last year totaled $44,287,000. By September, $71,287,000 had returned to the United States. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Transferring Gold to Maintain the Pound: Britain Implements New Financial Plan; Neither Inflationary Nor Exchange Control; Netherlands Likely to Cooperate with Britain</h3>
<p>The British Treasury's decision to transfer gold from the Bank of England to strengthen the Exchange Equalisation Account and maintain the strength of the pound has been widely welcomed here. London sources say the Equalisation Account will have a huge sum of £450,000,000, enough to cope with any emergency. Foreign speculators should understand that this new plan is not comparable to inflation, as it does not affect the increase in the amount of banknotes in circulation. The exact amount of foreign exchange balance still available in London cannot be estimated, but there is no doubt that even if foreign funds continue to be withdrawn in large quantities, the authorities have the power to stop the adverse effects of such actions within two years. Moreover, a large portion of the foreign exchange balance is the cash held in the Treasury, so the transfer of gold will not affect the foreign exchange position. Responsible parties have also made it clear that the plan to protect the pound is not for exchange control. (Reuters telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>The gold issued by the Bank of England in London is worth £200,000,000 at the original price, but £350,000,000 at the current market price. After the decision on Friday to transfer this cash to the Exchange Equalisation Account, operators in the London foreign exchange and gold markets were very busy yesterday morning. Although pound trading was not very active at the opening, the price rose in dollar terms as the shorts rushed to cover, but the Exchange Equalisation Account sold dollars to curb the decline. At the close of the gold market, the authorities solicited gold prices at a premium of two pence, absorbing two-thirds of the amount sold. (Reuters telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. Although the Netherlands has not yet decided what attitude it will take towards Britain's actions to protect its currency, it is expected that the Netherlands will not refuse to cooperate with Britain to stop speculative acts that are detrimental to the pound. Dutch newspapers all say that Britain's move to maintain the pound is of great importance to the Netherlands. For the Dutch shipping company operating in the Dutch East Indies, the current British currency price is a factor in the success or failure of its business, because people in the East Indies calculate the value of their products in British pounds. According to the opinion of the financial community here, the falling price of the pound has had an adverse impact on Dutch commerce. (Reuters telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Launch Three-Pronged Offensive; Catalonia Front in Peril</h3>
<p>Madrid. The Spanish government forces claim that the government forces on the Estremadura front have reached a point 90 miles from the Portuguese border, and have crossed the Zujo River into the province of Badajoz. Government forces have also occupied important heights near Mount Toroso. (Reuters telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Saragossa. Spanish Nationalist forces crossed the Ebro River yesterday to attack the southern part of the province of Tarragona, and are now only 22 miles from the coast. Government forces in the Tortosa area are now in a precarious position. The defense of the Catalonia front seems to be gradually breaking down. The Nationalist forces are advancing rapidly on all fronts in fine weather. The Nationalist forces also said that the Northern Nationalist forces have reached Doncel, the Central Nationalist forces have advanced six miles along the Mengai Highway from the end of the Balaguer Bridge, and the Southern Nationalist forces advanced four miles yesterday morning and are now approaching Winbauddy. At the same time, the Nationalist forces on other fronts are also making rapid progress in the most dangerous mountains. (Reuters telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Situation After the Raids on Nanao: Refugees Urgently Need Relief; Japanese Troops Frequently Arrive to Inspect</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence. After the second recovery of Nanao, on the 25th, the Shantou Red Cross Society sent several staff members again, carrying 2,000 yuan in legal tender, along with medicines, etc., and took a boat from Dongli, Chenghai, to Nanao to provide relief. According to those who provided relief back to Shantou, the first district of Longhan was burned down 80% due to many battles. Shenao, Qingao, and Yunao suffered less damage, and half of the houses were preserved. 70% of the refugees have returned. Those with a little property have returned to repair the tile roofs and build temporary shelters. Compared with the first inspection in mid-November, it has gradually become more vital. People are already cultivating in the fields, and some people are dragging fishing boats to the seaside to repair the burned boats in order to make a living at sea. More than 10,000 family members of fishermen who returned from Raoping and Chenghai are emaciated, haggard, and living under dilapidated walls, starting to sort out furniture. Nanao party affairs personnel Zhang Qianlong and others have returned to organize and train the people. The county office (originally in Longao) was destroyed, leaving only the walls, so it is temporarily located on Haishan Island and has not moved back to work. District chiefs and township chiefs have been re-elected in each district to listen to the county office and implement various policies, compile house numbers and household registrations. All daily necessities are transported by Chaoshan sailing ships. Although there is no market there, private goods are rampant. Salt can be bought for five or six catties per mill, and it has become a free commercial port. Smuggling ships also stop in the county to load and unload private goods. Japanese armed motorboats must go to Nanao every three to five days for reconnaissance, landing with arms and asking the residents if there are any Chinese troops stationed, and whether there is a plainclothes commando team organized. After asking, they leave. Japanese troops trade in Nanao, using Japanese military notes. Japanese warships are anchored between Nanao and Chenghai, about two or three ships. Sometimes they deliberately sink fishing boats, but they no longer pursue sailing ships. At this time, sea traffic is still convenient. There are no military police to maintain order in each district of Nanao, and there are no bandits looting. The people have nothing of value to plunder, so the public security feels good instead. Every time the Japanese army goes to Nanao for reconnaissance, they deliberately give small favors to win the hearts of the people. The Chinese government's relief to the refugees cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Puppet County Office Establishes Puppet Salt Bureau; Zhang Zhengyi Appointed Puppet Director</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence. Kunshan Salt Guild Hall has always been run by the government. After the Japanese army occupied Kunshan, they completely plundered a large batch of salt in the East Gate Salt Depot, worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As a result, salt prices soared, and the residents all complained bitterly. Last February, the puppet county office was established. The puppet magistrate Wang Youzhi is a master of collecting money. Recently, due to the exhaustion of the puppet office's funds, he came up with an odd idea to bring salt under the management of the puppet office in order to raise prices and hoard goods. The puppet salt bureau was established a few days ago, and Zhang Zhengyi was appointed as the puppet director. Zhang was the former district chief of the first district of Kunshan County. This time, he dared to do anything wrong and worked for the tiger. He also changed his previous attitude and spared no effort in searching and exploiting, so the people hated him to the bone.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Suisuo Face Difficult Advance or Retreat; Key Areas Surrounding Japanese Troops Controlled by Chinese Troops; Chinese Troops Bravely Assaulted Suining and Even Rushed into the City</h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence. The Japanese troops entrenched in the Suisui area have been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese army has no strength to advance again. Although the Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou has transferred and pieced together mixed Japanese and puppet troops twice to reinforce them, they were also attacked by the Chinese army with a preemptive surprise attack, killing many enemies and destroying more than 90 tanks, a lot of ammunition and military supplies. Currently, there are about 1,000 Japanese troops in Sisuocheng and Sisuosanhushu, Gengche, Suiningyu, and Suilingzhen, which belong to Suining. They are ordinary troops and have no mechanized coordination. Because the key areas of the four countries where the Japanese troops are entrenched are controlled by the Chinese army, they are afraid to advance or retreat and dare not commit any crimes. The Chinese army is now planning to take the opportunity to annihilate the Japanese army in one fell swoop. It has been raining and snowing for days, so neither side has taken any active action for the time being, and the war has temporarily subsided. In addition, the Japanese troops in Suicheng have repeatedly requested reinforcements from the Japanese army headquarters in Suisuoqianshang. The Japanese army headquarters has now transferred more than 400 Japanese troops entrenched in the Suizhen area to Suicheng. Although the battle situation between the two sides has been calm in recent days, the newly arrived Japanese troops in Suicheng are building traffic roads at the North Gate of Suqian, as if they are going to do something. However, the Chinese army is prepared to launch another突击. In addition, the Japanese side in Suizhen is empty. Chinese troops, guerrillas, and people's self-defense forces are planning to take the opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that there are only more than 100 Japanese troops trapped in Suining City, with 40 to 50 artillerymen and more than 10 artillery pieces. Artillery positions have been built in the Kuixing Building in the southeast of the city and at the South Gate. In addition, dozens of troops are stationed in Shuanggou, Lingchengtown, and Gengchetown. They are afraid of being attacked by the Chinese army at any time, and they dare not relax their vigilance. Japanese troops never dare to sneak into other towns and villages in the suburbs of the city lightly, because they have been repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army at Zhulou and Buziji, suffering heavy casualties. Therefore, after experiencing cruel lessons, they no longer dare to attack rashly. However, on the 24th of last month, more than 30 Japanese troops in Suining City left the city in two armored vehicles and moved southwest, attempting to sneak into Siyang. They were spotted by the Chinese army guerrillas as soon as they arrived near Guanshanji, and were met with a head-on attack with guns and cannons. After a fierce battle for a while, the Japanese army was unable to support it, and the road had been destroyed by the Chinese army, so they had to flee back to Suining in a panic. On the morning of the same day, dozens of Japanese troops in Suining also went to Suqian in an attempt to make contact with the Japanese troops in Suqian. As soon as they arrived near Shaji, they were discovered by Wang Baohua, a student of the Youth Corps. He immediately led more than 30 members of the people's self-defense team he had organized to intercept them. The fighting was fierce, and both sides suffered casualties. It was not until nearly noon that the Japanese army finally failed and returned to Suining.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Suita, in addition to rushing to build fortifications to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking, they also implemented their policy of appeasement to anesthetize the people. At the same time, they instructed Zhao Guanyi to establish a puppet county office, with Zhao as the puppet magistrate. They sent Han traitor minions to go to the city and outside to summon the people to return to the city and ordered them to buy passes, one corner for each pass. All the people who returned to the city and stayed in the city without being able to hide must bring one for themselves. On the 16th of last month, the Chinese army secretly sent more than 30 plainclothes team members disguised as people to enter the city to buy them. They killed more than 30 Japanese troops and puppet officials who were monitoring the sale of passes, and then returned to their original defense. After this attack by the Japanese army, not only did the selling stop abruptly, but also strict defenses were deployed inside and outside the city, and pedestrians were not allowed to travel. Since Suqian fell, no less than a thousand innocent people have been killed. The people in the city are trapped at home and cannot go out. The Japanese army still takes the opportunity to inspect and loot at will, causing wealthy households to become poor, and poor households to freeze and starve to death. The situation is extremely tragic. As for the Japanese troops trapped in the city, there are currently a thousand infantry and cavalry troops and two or thirty tanks and armored vehicles. However, because the soldiers lack fighting spirit and the tanks lack gasoline, they cannot move. Gengche in Suishu was originally stationed with 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers. The majority have been transferred because the strength of the Japanese army in Suicheng was empty. It is now confirmed that there are only more than 30 Japanese soldiers there. The Chinese army's Li department's guerrilla pig has led his department to suppress them. The Japanese army did not dare to resist and fled to Suqian in a panic. Li's department immediately occupied Gengche. However, because there was no need to hold it, Li's department secretly deployed in nearby villages, preparing to give the Japanese army a major blow at any time. The Japanese army's grain platform in Suqian is now located in the Cai Family Ancestral Hall. Two cannons are set up on Guokuang Mountain, one pointing east and one pointing north. The traffic line between Suqian Shunheji must pass through the ferry in the middle of the canal. Near the Sanbu Bridge, the Japanese army placed ships, seemingly for use as ferries. On the 19th, more than 100 Japanese troops marched from Gengche to Suyuncheng, but there was no other movement.</p>
<h3>New Fourth Route Army Political Work Stipulates Discipline for Soldiers and Holds Monthly Discussions</h3>
<p>Continuation of the Special Correspondent Belden's Dispatch from the English American Evening News: Three regulations for soldiers of the New Fourth Route Army to obey: (1) Resist Japan to the end, do not surrender to the enemy, do not compromise; (2) Obey the orders of superiors; (3) Love the people. There are six more articles: (1) Cherish military equipment; (2) Cherish public property; (3) Be punctual; (4) Be alert and active; (5) Be neat and clean; (6) Be gentle and polite. Soldiers must also abide by ten points, all of which are followed by the former Red Army: (1) When borrowing accommodation from the people, return the door panel and straw used for bedding to their original place when leaving; (2) Wipe the floor clean; (3) Speak kindly; (4) Pay the original price for shopping; (5) Return the items borrowed from the people; (6) If you damage the borrowed items, compensate the original owner for the loss; (7) Go to the toilet in the outhouse; (8) Avoid being seen by women when bathing; (9) Carry out propaganda work at any time; (10) Do not kill prisoners indiscriminately. Political workers tell soldiers that they should automatically obey these rules. Even if there are violations, they will not be beaten or scolded. To take a violation of Article 7 as an example, the political worker will always summon the violator and tell him that he must not urinate and defecate anywhere, which is a disgrace to the army. If the soldier violates the regulations twice, the soldier's mistakes will be announced in a meeting. If he violates the regulations three times, he will be fined to clean up or detained in the prison cell for two hours. Killing a prisoner is considered an extremely serious incident. A general meeting is convened to thoroughly investigate the past behavior of the violating soldier. If it is found that his behavior is improper or his intentions are bad, he will be sentenced to death. If it is found that the soldier was moved by righteous indignation, he will be severely punished or detained in the prison cell. The soldiers of the New Fourth Route Army live in exceptionally clean places. I have seen them persuade people to clean up, talk to the people very kindly, and see how carefully they treat prisoners. All soldiers in the army, except for staff and other officers, take daily classes, in which college students, university professors, etc., give lectures on the meaning of the united front and war, the future of the anti-Japanese war, and international relations, etc., and report news at any time. Every morning when I get up, I see cooks, messengers, and orderlies sitting on the grass, listening quietly to the lectures. Officers do not attend classes, but hold monthly discussions. Each team in the army has its own education plan, and each has a "National Salvation Room," which is actually a club automatically organized by soldiers. Generally, the portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De are hung. Occasionally, the portraits of Lenin and Stalin are hung. Each room holds night meetings every night, organizes newspaper reading classes, etc., and posts wall newspapers, which are written at will by officers, soldiers, or messengers. The content is also indefinite. After dinner, each team engages in games. A crude tennis court has been opened outside the hospital. The most common one is the hide-and-seek game. The New Fourth Route Army publishes its own five-day newspaper called "Resist the Enemy", with a circulation of 1,000 copies per issue. The Second Division also publishes its own newspaper called "Fire Money", which publishes national military news and the battle reports of the Second Division, and publishes and distributes a newspaper called "National Salvation" to the people. Every Saturday and Sunday, soldiers perform songs, dances, and dramas at the rear headquarters, and at least once a month in Qianqian. Actors train themselves, and the printed scripts are also self-edited. The above-mentioned is the work of the Political Department in the army. The following will describe how the Political Department works among the people.</p>
<h3>Wuxi's Rice Industry in Irreversible Decline; Future Food Supply of the People Causes Serious Concern</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence. Wuxi has always been known as a silk and rice area. Every year, cocoons and silk have a huge output. Rice and grain are not produced locally, but it is a gathering and sales area. The shops in the Beihang area are lined up, the storage warehouses are dotted all over, the large grain boats in Ronghu are connected from beginning to end, the sails are like a forest, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, selling and buying, merchants gather, the rice and grain of northern Jiangsu and Jintan Yili are all concentrated in Wuxi, and the prosperity or decline of various industries also depends on the rice industry as the hub. During the anti-Japanese war, the Wuxi rice market disappeared without a trace. Last spring, a small number of rice merchants fled back and returned, each soliciting from friends and scraping together 30 to 50 yuan to 200 to 300 yuan. They built simple sheds, thatched houses, and bamboo huts in Beihang to barely shield themselves from the wind and rain and reluctantly did business. Because the equipment was simple and the expenses were saved, there was no distinction between shop owners and partners, and there was a company partnership. Profits and losses were shared, and benefits were shared equally. At that time, there were few businesses and many customers, and each had a surplus. When new wheat came on the market, those who returned to make profits came one after another, and merchants from all over came one after another. Although the market was lively, the profits were not as good as before. In August, new grain came on the market, and the new shops had slightly thicker capital, which was far from the simplicity of early spring, but there were not many merchants and the business was not very good. The huge expenses have made it difficult to support in recent months. Since the puppet business tax was levied, at the same time, freight rates increased, and the cost of merchants and vendors increased, making it unprofitable, so most of them changed their routes and went to other ports, resulting in a sharp reduction in business and a sudden decline. In less than a year, the rice industry fell sharply. The fatal reason is that in the past, customers could use rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains to mortgaged loans from banks for on-the-spot warehousing or shipping. Therefore, the grain stored in each warehouse often had as many as three or four million stones after the winter solstice. Now, the financial institutions have not yet resumed business, and there is no way to facilitate the use of funds. The current amount of rice in the warehouse is less than 100,000 stones, and the output in the four townships has decreased due to the impact of the invasion. Therefore, there are real worries about the future food supply of the people. Please try to buy them and transport them to your country in a steady stream. There is a danger of shortage of rice and grain in the spring when the new grain is not yet available. The Wuxi rice industry has declined irreversibly, and the date of its revival is unknown.</p>
<h3>Siming Elder, Xin Shaoru, Passes Away</h3>
<p>Yinxian Correspondence. Xin Jiangming, also known as Xin Shaoru, also known as Zunian, a respected elder of Yinxian, started his career as a Jinshi and served as the magistrate of Qianshan, Bozhou, and Tongcheng, displaying remarkable political achievements. After the founding of the Republic of China, he returned to his hometown to take care of his parents and refused to be involved in worldly affairs. In his later years, he devoted himself to local literature, continuing the legacy of his maternal uncle, Dong Juexuan (Pei), a pioneer, and edited several volumes of Siming Qing Poetry, and also edited the Siming Series, all of which have been published to the world. His writing style was pure and profound, with a clear ambition to be indifferent. He authored "Crane Nest Elder's Literary Collection". He was harmonious but different in his daily life, and he adhered to integrity. After returning to his hometown, he repeatedly declined invitations to serve in the government, and his morality and articles became a respected figure in eastern Zhejiang. Unexpectedly, he suffered from a prolonged illness and eventually passed away in his home on the first day of the lunar calendar this year, at the age of sixty-seven. The passing of an experienced and respected figure is deeply mourned by all who hear of it.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Financial Market (I): The Magnificent Stature of Shanghai's Financial Community Before the War</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>Shanghai has been a vital hub of the nation's economy and finance for nearly a century. It is not only the birthplace of all modern financial institutions but also the center of their concentration. Before the war, it possessed 32.5% of the nation's banks, with 128 branch offices densely distributed throughout the city. In total, there were as many as 181 banks (1). Among them, the 42 member banks held 45.0% of the total paid-up capital of the nation's banks (2), with total assets of 3,220 million yuan, accounting for over 44.5% of the national total (3), and cash reserves of slightly less than 652.2 million yuan, accounting for 55.0% of the national total (4), various deposits</p>
<p>(Note) (1) According to a survey by the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China, as of the end of June in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), there were 164 banks nationwide, with Shanghai accounting for 53. There were 1,627 branch offices nationwide, with Shanghai accounting for 128.</p>
<p>(2) Calculated based on the detailed operating statistics of the National Bank Yearbook for the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the total national capital was 402,695,909 yuan, with Shanghai member banks accounting for 178,561,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Calculated from the same source, the national total was 7,275,859,0751 yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 3,216,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Calculated from the same source, the national total was 1,071,803,726 yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 651,920,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) Calculated from the same source, the national total was 4,551,268,962 yuan, with Shanghai accounting for 3,409,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>totaling 3,409 million yuan, accounting for as much as 76.1% of the national total (5). Moreover, this is limited to the records of 41 member banks, excluding non-member banks such as the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The money exchange business was originally created in Shanghai over 200 years ago and has long been a leader among China's traditional financial institutions. Although it has been relegated to a secondary position since the rise of the banking industry, it still possesses considerable potential throughout the country. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), there were 1,189 money exchanges and silver shops nationwide, with a total capital of over 70 million yuan. Although the number of Shanghai's remittance exchanges had decreased to 55 at that time, their capital reached over 20 million yuan, accounting for nearly one-third of the national total (6).</p>
<p>Of the 25 Chinese-owned insurance companies nationwide, Shanghai alone accounted for 22, with capital accounting for nearly 90% (7).</p>
<p>Within the concession areas of Shanghai, covering over 800 square kilometers, there were 11 Chinese-owned trust companies. However,</p>
<p>(Note) (6) Calculated based on the National Bank Yearbook for the 24th year of the Republic (1935), excluding the Four Northeastern Provinces. (9) According to Zhang Yifan's "Dictionary of Finance" (published by World Book Company in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]).</p>
<p>in the nation's territory of over 11.17 million square kilometers, there were only 2 (8).</p>
<p>The warehouses and storage yards densely distributed along the major rivers, north and south, and along railway and highway lines were almost entirely backed by Shanghai's financial capital.</p>
<p>Silver companies, savings societies, real estate companies, and exchanges all had Shanghai as their sole base of operations. Even the ancient financial institutions most suited to feudal society, such as pawnshops, were most numerous in the capitalized society of Shanghai. Before the war, the major cities and towns across the country had a total of 4,632 pawnshops, with Shanghai alone possessing 660, holding capital of slightly less than 20 million yuan, while the national total was only over 140 million yuan (9).</p>
<p>Foreign investment in China was also mainly directed towards Shanghai. Of the total investment of 3,242.2 million US dollars in 1931, Shanghai accounted for 34.3%, totaling 1,112.2 million</p>
<p>(Note) (8) Table on page 142 of Volume 32, Issue 7 of the Oriental Magazine.</p>
<p>(9) According to Zhang Yifan: Appendix to the Dictionary of Finance (published by World Book Company in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]) US dollars (10). With this capital strength, they built their thrones of control over China's economy. Financial capitals such as British-owned Mercantile Bank, HSBC, and Chartered Bank; French-owned Banque de l'Indochine; Dutch-owned Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij; German-owned Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; and Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi, had already come to Shanghai for activities before China even had banks. Mercantile Bank even transplanted its branch to the Bund less than ten years after Shanghai was opened as a port.</p>
<p>Because both Chinese and foreign capital took Shanghai as their center of operation, coupled with the vast fertile lands and abundant resources of the Yangtze River basin as their background, all of Shanghai's commercial and financial activities were able to spread their influence throughout the country and had the power to control everything. For example, the prices of various exchanges in Shanghai were the pivot points for market fluctuations across the country. The prosperity or decline of the securities market could even affect the fate of the national treasury. Even benchmark gold and cotton had the power to influence the entire Far Eastern market. Such a magnificent stature was already known to the world.</p>
<p>(Note) (10) C.F. Remer, Foreign Investments in China.</p>
<p>(II) "The Financial Era of an Isolated Island"—Today's Unique Characteristics of China</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Shanghai has been the first to bear the brunt and is now reduced to an isolated island. This once prominent and invincible power has greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Although due to the cooperation of officials and merchants, and the proper handling of countermeasures, a collective security system has been completed; and benefiting from the special relationship of the concession areas; various financial institutions have generally been able to maintain a precarious existence, dragging on until today. Moreover, over 160 branch offices and agencies belonging to 29 institutions have moved to Shanghai from nearby war zones to resume operations. However, their so-called operations are only limited to sorting out accounts and handling the aftermath. There is no business to be done. The vast majority of the 3 million or so citizens, refugees, and quasi-refugees are hardly qualified as customers for their business. Moreover, the larger-scale Chinese financial institutions are all virtually empty shells, with no substance inside. Not only is their capital, which is like blood and essence, either swallowed up by fire or temporarily maintaining the current situation, so although they have a bright exterior, they are actually empty shells. Even if that were not the case, they only have paper claims, deceiving others and deceiving themselves. They cannot help but gaze remotely at the war-torn areas where smoke is rising everywhere, secretly shedding tears.</p>
<p>(Note) (11) According to the Shen Bao, November 29, 27th year of the Republic (1938).</p>
<p>As for foreign merchants, they now only have the qualification to prepare for claiming compensation for war losses, and no longer have the special privilege to continue their free entry and exit from China. For example, a large shipment of silver transported by the American Express Bank was intercepted by a certain party halfway and had to be hidden in Shanghai again: this is one example.</p>
<p>Before the war, everyone knew that Shanghai's financial market had three groups: foreign banks, Chinese banks, and money exchanges. At that time, they competed fiercely for dominance and were incompatible. Now, except for Japanese merchants, they are all in the same boat. For example, recently, foreign banks have agreed to accept the exchange clearingheads of Chinese merchants, no longer strictly distinguishing between the clearingheads of the Bund and others as in the past. Another example is that Chinese and foreign insurance merchants have now specially established a "Joint Sino-Foreign Special Affairs Committee" to jointly seek solutions to the current difficult situation. The exchange market has long been ordered to shut down, and although there is now a black market, its purpose is either to passively maintain its own wealth or to be used by others to dig its own grave. The activities of the securities black market can be said to be out of the former purpose. Illegal transactions of exorbitant foreign exchange rates have ultimately led to the depreciation of their assets valued in legal tender. The cotton prices in Tianjin and Jinan were originally controlled by the prices of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange. Other places such as Shijiazhuang had no status in the Chinese cotton market. However, today, the cotton markets in those places are not only no longer controlled by Shanghai but are also sometimes controlling Shanghai's market. Therefore, all activities on Shanghai's financial market today, at best, are only financial activities within over 800 square kilometers; they cannot be compared to the financial activities within over 11.1 million square kilometers before the war (12). Is this what is called the characteristic of today's isolated island financial market?</p>
<p>(Note) (12) According to the Shen Bao Yearbook: The total land area of the country is over 11.1 million square kilometers, and the Shanghai concession area is over 800 square kilometers. This number also includes the Eastern District, but in reality, the Eastern District is not a place where Shanghai's financial community can operate.</p>
<p>(III) The Isolated Island Finance, From Stagnation to Restlessness</p>
<p>Since August 13th, the activities of "isolated island finance" can be best described as speculative in early March of this year.</p>
<p>On the eve of the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Shanghai was in the midst of a rare speculative frenzy in recent years. The yarn and flower exchanges even prompted the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to thoroughly investigate. Even Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned financiers and others to Mount Lu to inquire about everything, and used unified measures to resolve the disputes at that time. Soon after, the battles of Zhabei began, and the exchanges were ordered to close immediately. The silver and money industries were only allowed to resume operations after the Ministry of Finance announced measures to stabilize finance. The so-called measures to stabilize finance were nothing more than two: one was to restrict the withdrawal of deposits; the other was that unrestricted commercial deposits could use remittance instruments. This kind of remittance instrument could not be exchanged for legal tender and could not be used to purchase foreign exchange, but its value was exactly the same as legal tender. Its nature was different from the drafts with the nature of tokens before the war. At that time, external communication and trade were cut off by the Japanese army, and all industries and businesses were in a state of standstill. Later, due to the westward withdrawal of the National Army, it became even more frozen. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Regular Guerrilla Forces Ordered to Fight, Counter-Offensive Begins on the Eastern Front: Traffic Between Jiaxing and Pinghu Cut Off, Japanese Troops in Shanghai Increase Reinforcements to Hangzhou Day by Day</h3>
<p>The overall counter-offensive by the Chinese guerrilla forces on the Eastern Front has now begun. The Chinese guerrilla forces in western Zhejiang have launched an attack since the 5th of this month, targeting the important military strongholds of the Japanese army in Hangzhou and Jiaxing. In recent days, the Japanese army has been frequently transferring troops on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. At the same time, there are also battles along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Army in Western Zhejiang Ordered to Fight</p>
<p>The regular guerrilla forces of the Chinese Army, the 63rd Army, 63rd Division, and 61st Division, after recapturing the county seat of Haiyan and the eastern part of Haiyan County, from the northern bank of the Qiantang River in western Zhejiang to Zhapu and Kanpu south of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, have gained a base. In that area, all order has been brought back on track, and the governments of various counties have also been established to assist the army in handling political work. Recently, the Chinese army there, having received operational orders from the Third War Area Command, launched an attack and began advancing towards Jiaxing and Pinghu counties, near the railway, on the 5th of this month. On the 5th and 6th, contact with the Japanese army occurred in the Jiuli Bridge and Shili Pavilion areas between Jiaxing and Pinghu, and the more than ten-mile roadbed of the Jiaxing-Pinghu Highway in that area has been destroyed by the Chinese army, so traffic between Jiaxing and Pinghu is cut off.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Pinghu Retreating</p>
<p>The important military strongholds of the Japanese army between Shanghai and Hangzhou are Jiaxing, because it has the Sujia Railway, which can connect with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line, and on the one hand, it leads to the Pinglan Highway, which can reach Zhapu on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. In addition to the naval ships along the coast, the Japanese army in the rear of Hangzhou on the north bank of the Qiantang River regards Jiaxing as a key hub for supplies. Therefore, after the Jia-Ping Road was cut off by the Chinese army, the Japanese army in Pinghu has fallen into isolation, surrounded by the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese troops stationed in Pinghu are only 200, which is very easy for the Chinese army to annihilate. Therefore, the county seat of Pinghu may be recaptured. According to people from Pinghu who came to Shanghai, the Japanese army in Pinghu seems to be retreating on its own. The puppet organs in the city are all in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Shanghai Opens to Hangzhou to Reinforce</p>
<p>The incident of the start of the battle near Hangzhou has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The Chinese army in Jiaxing, because it is to support the friendly forces there and to contain the Japanese army, has ordered the attack by the direct commander, which is actually the Chinese army's entire start to attack western Zhejiang. As for the Japanese army in Shanghai, it has sent a part of its garrison to rush to reinforce. The trains that have left Shanghai for Hangzhou in the past three days have been carrying Japanese troops, ranging from 300 to 500 people each time. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people have been dispatched, or even far more than this number.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles in Danyang and Changzhou</p>
<p>Also, along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, there are battles near Danyang and Changzhou. It is reported that Changzhou is very tense, and the Japanese army in the city has stepped up martial law. Rumors are also rife in Wuxi. The guerrilla forces north and south of the railway have already established contact, and everyone expects that a large-scale battle will break out there within days.</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Adjusts Wartime Finances: Rectifies Various Taxes, Promotes Direct Good Taxes, Cautiously Issues Legal Tender, Adopts Issuing Public Bonds</h3>
<p>In order to adjust its finances during the war of resistance, the Chinese government is making every effort to rectify various taxes, promote direct good taxes, and adopt the best method of issuing public bonds. As for the issuance of legal tender, it will adhere to the cautious policy of the past. For more than a year of the war, less than 300 million yuan has been issued, and cash reserves have actually increased. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rectify Taxes</p>
<p>(1) Stamp duty: The tax rates set in items 1 to 35 of the old stamp duty rate table shall be doubled. The original starting point for attaching stamps for goods or amounts of three yuan or more is now changed to one yuan or more. (2) Transit tax: A transit tax shall be levied on all local goods transported, loaded and unloaded, or passing through places with customs or branch cards, regardless of whether they are transported by railways, highways, ships, civilian ships, airplanes, post offices, or by transportation, in all places where there are customs. (3) Tobacco and alcohol tax: Various local wines will be subject to a surcharge of 50% of the old tax rate, and the tax on local tobacco leaves will remain the same, but the tax on local tobacco shreds will be 2 yuan and 7.5 cents per 100 pounds net weight. (4) The excessive profit tax for the extraordinary period has been levied since July 1st last year, and an inheritance tax is being prepared. (5) Unified tax: The provinces of Yunnan, Xinjiang, Xikang, and Qinghai have been changed to areas where the unified tax is implemented. As for the goods subject to the unified tax that are transported from Shanghai, the first entry inspection agency shall verify and collect the tax.</p>
<p>Issue Public Bonds</p>
<p>(1) National Salvation Bonds: 500 million yuan, issued on September 1, 26th year of the Republic (1937), with an annual interest rate of 4%, repayable in 30 years. (2) National Defense Bonds: 500 million yuan, issued on May 1, 27th year of the Republic (1938), with an annual interest rate of 6%, repayable in 30 years. (3) Gold Bonds: A. Customs gold notes for 100 million customs gold units. B. British gold notes for 10 million British pounds. C. US gold notes for 50 million US dollars. Issued on May 1, 27th year of the Republic (1938), with an annual interest rate of 5%, repayable in 15 years. (4) Relief Bonds: 100 million yuan, issued on July 1, 27th year of the Republic (1938), with an annual interest rate of 4%, repayable in 20 years. The above four types are all domestic debts issued after the War of Resistance. Among them, the purpose of the relief bonds is to relieve refugees in the war zone and has nothing to do with general fiscal expenditures. As for the foreign debts newly raised after the War of Resistance, the situation is unknown because the government has not announced it. Those that have appeared in the newspapers include Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, Sino-Czech, etc.</p>
<p>Carefully Issue Legal Tender</p>
<p>The issuance of legal tender in July of this year was 38,275,769.19 yuan by the Central Bank, 51,772,265.59 yuan by the Bank of China, 33,599,944 yuan by the Bank of Communications, and 20,843,201 yuan by the Farmers Bank of China, totaling 144,491,577.19 yuan. In June of last year, the Central Bank had 48,966,678.85 yuan, the Bank of China had 65,325,172 yuan, the Bank of Communications had 32,185,449.95 yuan, and the Farmers Bank of China had 26,221,983.35 yuan, totaling 172,699,783.35 yuan, an increase of 28,208,216 yuan.</p>
<p>Wartime Finance</p>
<p>From the above three wartime financial measures, it can be seen that the Chinese anti-war financial resources take the least from increasing taxes and take the least from issuing paper money. The biggest financial source is issuing public bonds. Moreover, historical evidence proves that issuing public bonds is the best method for raising wartime finance. Facts prove that our financial authorities do not use currency inflation as a method of raising wartime funds. Because after years of war, only more than 200 million yuan of legal tender has been issued. Moreover, the issuance of legal tender with the increase of more than 200 million yuan has accurate preparation. Because of the rise of the anti-war army, the country is unified, the circulation of legal tender is gradually promoted, and the demand for legal tender naturally increases. People in the occupied areas have risen to collect legal tender. At the same time, the government is particularly cautious about the issuance of legal tender. The issuance of cash reserves has actually increased compared to before the war.</p>
<h3>Family Members of Soldiers Should Be Respected: Difficulties in Household Affairs Should Be Resolved on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>After the Military Affairs Commission issued measures to provide preferential treatment to the families of soldiers fighting against the enemy, with regard to the soldiers serving the country, members of society should unanimously respect their families. Local government officials should treat them with courtesy and provide diligent assistance. At this time of cold weather at the end of the year, the county magistrates, township chiefs, and baojia chiefs should personally visit or send personnel to visit each household to express condolences. For those with difficulties in household affairs, they should seek solutions on their behalf within the possible range. As for the family members of all soldiers, if they have requests for assistance, whether public or private, they can frankly state their case to the township, town, or county government. All officials and public officials should sincerely help to make arrangements, and those with larger cases can directly apply to the district office for assistance. In short, the strength may not be sufficient, but the heart must be fully devoted.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Circular: Public Officials Should Be Diligent and Prudent, Taking Simple Plainness as a Matter of Course: Those Who Disobey Should Be Abandoned by the People</h3>
<p>The National Government Military Affairs Commission, at this time of serious national crisis and deep foreign invasion, in order to implement the purpose of resistance and nation-building, depends on the whole country, from top to bottom, sharing worries and encouraging each other, breaking through the difficult road ahead, and completing the achievements of nation-building. All public officials should feel ashamed and reflect on themselves, set an example, and establish a model for the people, in order to be worthy of their duties. However, recently, there are still some public officials who continue their past bad habits, extravagance and waste, and undisciplined behavior. Whether in actions or daily life, they still only seek comfort, without any awareness of self-encouragement. Not only does it give the local military and civilians a bad impression, but at this moment, the moment of life and death is at stake. Thinking of the frontline soldiers who have experienced cold and heat, fighting bloody battles in the trenches, and the suffering compatriots whose houses have been destroyed and who are displaced in ditches, one should not be able to eat or sleep in peace. How can they still have the heart to seek comfort? If they forget their responsibilities and disregard difficulties, they will have lost all shame. How can they hold public office? How can they lead the people to complete the revolution? Now, in order to rectify discipline, it is hoped that all public officials will arouse their conscience, deeply reflect on themselves, and take enduring hardship and simple plainness as a matter of course. All aspects of life must follow the principle of simplicity and plainness. If there are still those who do not practice what they preach or who disobey, once discovered, in addition to being dealt with according to the circumstances, the facts shall be made public to be abandoned by the people, and to serve as a warning to those who disregard danger and have no spirit.</p>
<h3>Economic Aggression is Vicious: Factories in War Zones are Occupied: Silk Factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang are All Operated by Japanese Merchants: Large-Scale Dumping of Daily Necessities in War Zones</h3>
<p>After the "August 13th" war broke out, China's industrial factories were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, causing the most severe damage. Up to now, most have not been able to resume operations. The Japanese side previously used economic cooperation as an excuse to attempt to take over Chinese silk factories and control them, which was unanimously rejected by all factories. However, the Japanese side's attempts did not stop because of this. Recently, the Japanese side has seized all large and small factory foundations, properties, and production machinery in the war zones of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, taking them for their own use. For example, in Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang and other places,</p>
<p>Silk Factories Are All Operated by Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Recruiting male and female workers and starting work as usual. Under the trampling of iron hooves, the treatment is extremely harsh. All the goods produced are dumped in large quantities in various regions of central China. In addition, there are more small factories for daily handicrafts that have been forcibly taken over by the Japanese side, such as towels, soap, candles, matches, and tobacco. The output in the war zone is very large. Among them, those who still use the original factory name to produce their products are euphemistically called Sino-Japanese joint ventures. In reality, the power is entirely in the hands of the Japanese. It can be seen that Japan's policy of</p>
<p>Economic Aggression is Vicious</p>
<p>In one instance, according to investigators who have been to the war zone, there are a total of six silk factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang that have been forcibly occupied and started by the Japanese, with more than 10,000 workers. The seized foundations and properties are worth 30 million yuan in national currency. In Suzhou alone, there are no less than 30 small factories that have been robbed and newly established by the Japanese, specializing in the production of daily necessities, which are dumped everywhere. This method of sucking blood and marrow by the Japanese side not only exposes the true face of its aggressors, but also proves that its domestic economy is at the end of its rope and it has to adopt this conspiracy to prolong its last fate.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Temporarily Residing in Shanghai: Everyone is Now Working Hard to Learn English to Gain a Foothold in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that over the past few months, the number of Jewish refugees arriving in Shanghai has reached 1,500. They are all taken care of by three organizations, providing food, lodging, and pocket money, and inviting medical care and teachers to teach English. One of the three organizations is the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Assistance Committee, which is responsible for most economic matters, while the actual relief work is handled by the German-Austrian Jewish Relief Association or the International Committee for the Relief of European Refugees. The former only</p>
<p>Relieves Jews, but the scope is very broad. The latter provides relief to any refugees who have fled from European dictatorships. However, the relief work for Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai is mostly handled by the German-Austrian Jewish Relief Association. The association also communicates daily with European relief organizations via telegram. For example, a certain relief organization in Singapore is entrusted by the association to take care of any refugees passing by on ships and telegraph the number of refugees coming to Shanghai to the association for preparation. When the refugees arrive in Shanghai, the association</p>
<p>Rents Private Houses to Settle Some Refugees, and Provides Food Expenses. However, this method is too wasteful, so the association would rather adopt a system of communal living and eating. For example, when Jewish refugees currently living in the Anpengkemen Building (transliteration) have meals, they all go to the Sichuan Road YMCA to dine. However, the association hopes to provide meals on its own, which is more economical. Most of the Jewish refugees coming to Shanghai are middle-class, and very few can speak English, which is a major setback. Therefore, the Shanghai Jewish Youth Federation has now been organized to teach English. The federation also has a very important</p>
<p>Job Placement Department, which compiles detailed statistics on the talents of immigrants. However, so far, only about 100 Jewish refugees have been introduced to jobs. The association expresses great sympathy for the Municipal Council's efforts to limit the number of immigrants, because Shanghai cannot accommodate many refugees at present. However, if refugees have already started to come to Shanghai, they will do their best to provide relief. According to the opinion of the association's personnel, after the war stops, immigrants should be given a foothold in the Far East, and Shanghai is only a temporary resting place for them.</p>
<h3>Overseas Branches of the Bank of Communications Established One After Another</h3>
<p>In order to invigorate the finance of the southwestern provinces, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have added more than 40 branches in the major ports of the southwest, actively handling industrial, commercial and rural loans, which has been quite successful. In order to adapt to the development of foreign trade, the branches established by the Bank of China in Rangoon, British Burma, and Batavia, Dutch East Indies, have started operations. At the same time, the Bank of Communications has also decided to establish a branch in Manila, Philippines. Li Daonan, the president of the Bank of Communications in Hong Kong, has gone to prepare for it and is ready. According to news from the banking community in this city, the two branches of the Bank of China can be established within the month. The Philippine branch of the Bank of Communications is waiting for Qian Xinzhi, the chairman of the bank, to return to Hong Kong from Chongqing to approve the plan, which can be realized before the spring of this year. The business of each branch focuses on remittances from overseas Chinese and the development of foreign trade of domestic products, and the future is very promising.</p>
<h3>Extension of Voucher Contract Approved by Banks</h3>
<p>The Yinqian Liangye Gonghui (Silver and Money Trade Association) received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the voucher contracts for various banks and firms to receive legal tender from the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank are tentatively extended for another year based on the original amount. However, if the situation stabilizes and the bond market becomes stable during this one-year period, the issuing bank may notify the voucher-receiving bank to terminate the contract two months in advance. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with the Yinqian industry yesterday and learned that the two industry associations have recorded the Ministry's original telegram regarding the approval of the one-year extension of the voucher contract and ordered member banks and firms to comply. It is reported that various banks and firms expressed gratitude to the government for understanding the difficulties of businesses and approving the one-year extension.</p>
<h3>Government Promotes Rural Handicraft Industry Establishes Five Major Guidelines Mobilizes Vast Rural Population to Strengthen Economic Foundation for Resistance</h3>
<p>The National Government is making every effort to operate general industrial construction during the war of resistance. In addition to important industries such as sericulture, chemicals, water and electricity, and textiles, China's rural handicraft industry has unique characteristics. If guidance and improvement can be provided, production can be increased to supplement the shortcomings of the machine industry. Currently, the government has decided to actively proceed with the following guidelines to promote the rural handicraft industry: First, actively improve technology to increase production and meet the needs of rural areas during the war of resistance. Second, establish small-scale iron and woodworking factories in various county towns to supply various production tools. Third, the Farmer's Bank should provide as many loans as possible for the rural handicraft industry to facilitate development. Fourth, support and organize rural handicraft cooperatives to adjust production and sales. Fifth, rural handicraft production is simple, and the government has decided to mobilize the vast rural population to participate in production to strengthen the economic foundation for resistance and national construction.</p>

<h3>Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai Municipal Council Not Restricting Newspaper Reports Completely Groundless Only Quite Anxious About This Matter</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reported that news from Japan stated that the</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council of the International</p>
<p>Settlement had requested the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai to</p>
<p>take certain measures to prevent Jewish</p>
<p>immigrants from flocking into the International Settlement. Yesterday (7th),</p>
<p>a spokesman for the Municipal Council denied this. According to</p>
<p>this news, it was published in the</p>
<p>English-language Japan Times published in Tokyo on January 1st. The newspaper</p>
<p>also commented that Japan is now at war with China</p>
<p>and of course does not want to see</p>
<p>political refugees</p>
<p>flocking into Japan,</p>
<p>"Manchukuo,"</p>
<p>or North China and Central China. Japan does not want to be</p>
<p>used by Britain in the Far East as a tool</p>
<p>for anti-Semitic activities, etc. According to reports yesterday, this news</p>
<p>is absolutely groundless. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council</p>
<p>attaches great importance to the current influx of German immigrants</p>
<p>into the International Settlement, but the Council</p>
<p>has only notified the consular corps of the possibility of restrictions. This article in the Japan Times</p>
<p>shows that the Municipal Council's news about preventing immigrants from continuing to come to Shanghai</p>
<p>is not new, but the previous news</p>
<p>was also groundless.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council</p>
<p>is naturally anxious about the excessive exaggeration of the</p>
<p>foreign immigrant problem in Shanghai, which makes it impossible to deal with, but there is</p>
<p>nothing that can be done at the moment.</p>
<p>The number of German exiles coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>has reached about 1,500. It is expected that the Victoria,</p>
<p>a ship sailing from Italy to Shanghai, will</p>
<p>arrive on the 15th of this month, and will also bring</p>
<p>Jewish refugees. According to a spokesman for the Foreign Refugee Relief</p>
<p>Association, when talking to reporters about the issue</p>
<p>of these immigrants, he said that raising 90,000 yuan</p>
<p>for living expenses is indeed</p>
<p>not a problem for Shanghai alone, and providing this money</p>
<p>is the actual responsibility of foreign</p>
<p>governments. The spokesman also said that the association</p>
<p>is already working on getting this funding.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was learned that Shanghai is</p>
<p>really powerless to prevent the continued influx of</p>
<p>immigrant groups. Because all parties in Shanghai have no right to order immigrants to leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jews fleeing the anti-Jewish wave in Germany, if any</p>
<p>control is to be exercised over the actions of these people,</p>
<p>then it should be done by the country</p>
<p>where these immigrants boarded the ship.</p>
<p>Most of the places where immigrants boarded the ship</p>
<p>are in Italy. If the Italian government wants to</p>
<p>cooperate in handling this matter, then the domestic offices</p>
<p>of Italian shipping companies can refuse</p>
<p>to sell tickets to immigrants who designate</p>
<p>Shanghai as their destination. If other countries also cooperate,</p>
<p>the same control can be implemented. However, we have</p>
<p>attempted to obtain such cooperation and control, but</p>
<p>Shanghai has not yet been informed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Buses Operating Municipal Council Protests Conflict with Concession Rights</h3>
<p>Trams, buses, etc. operating in Hongkou and Yangshupu have always been granted concessions by the Municipal Council</p>
<p>to the China General Omnibus Company and the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company.</p>
<p>Vehicles of the two companies stopped running on the roads north of the Suzhou River</p>
<p>after the war, and have not resumed operations to this day. However, buses transported by the Japanese army have already been put into operation in Hongkou.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council believes that this move clearly conflicts with the concession granted to the China General Omnibus Company,</p>
<p>and has therefore protested to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Establishing Shelters to Accommodate Street Refugees There Are Over 10,000 Street Refugees Establishing Shelters to Accommodate Them Cannot Be Delayed Any Further</h3>
<p>Liu Zhongying, Cao Zhigong, and Li Futian, members of the Citizens' Group Vegetable Procurement Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, jointly proposed to the association yesterday, stating: We hereby inform you that since the organization of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association by various public organizations, charities, and Chinese and foreign people, all measures have become increasingly perfect. At the same time, fundraising has also been gradually grasped due to the widespread promotion by various industries and sectors. This is truly a blessing for the 100,000 refugees in the resettlement camps. However, at this time of severe winter, street refugees are unable to eat when hungry and unable to clothe themselves when cold. Their situation is even more miserable than that of the refugees in the resettlement camps. According to the survey and statistics published by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement on methods of soliciting donations for refugees, the owners of various dance halls have unanimously expressed their support for the association's good intentions and are willing to assist in promoting them. The method is roughly to add 10% to all catering bills as refugee donations. In addition, the dance girls have also organized a fundraising team to carry out fundraising. It is reported that the above method will be discussed and decided at the second meeting on the 10th of this month, and fundraising committee members and heads of various groups will be appointed to start work immediately.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Achievements of Amateur Opera Group</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Amateur Opera Group</p>
<p>of the Shanghai Refugee Relief</p>
<p>Association, since hiring</p>
<p>Jin Tingsun and Yuan Ludeng as chairman and vice-chairman respectively,</p>
<p>and hiring members of various groups and heads of solicitation teams,</p>
<p>has been making every effort to promote fundraising work in recent days.</p>
<p>The relief donations raised have reached more than 9,000 yuan. Also, on the 9th of this month,</p>
<p>it will be the 60th anniversary of the death of Mr. Jiang Fuxiang's late mother in Shanghai. The group specially initiated a toast, and</p>
<p>all the congratulatory gifts will be donated in full. Members of the group will also participate in performing at a hall show.</p>
<h3>Kun Opera Fundraising Efforts Continue</h3>
<p>Comrades from the</p>
<p>Shanghai Gengchun She</p>
<p>Kun Opera Troupe,</p>
<p>Yin Zhenxian, Xu</p>
<p>Lingyun, Hua Xiaowei,</p>
<p>Guan Ji'an, etc., performed</p>
<p>an obligatory Kun Opera performance at the Carlton Grand Theater</p>
<p>on the 6th, and after deducting miscellaneous expenses,</p>
<p>there was a surplus of more than 600 yuan in national currency, which was sent to</p>
<p>the Refugee Relief Association for the purpose of providing relief to refugees.</p>
<p>The members of the troupe decided to stage another Kun Opera performance in the near future, but the performance date</p>
<p>has not been determined. The plays performed are all the members' signature plays.</p>
<p>There were a total of 7,790 refugees living in the alleyways and some vacant houses in the International Settlement</p>
<p>in November of last year. Counting the legal concessions,</p>
<p>there should be more than 10,000 people. The suffering of these more than 10,000 refugees wandering the streets is something</p>
<p>we should try to help with from a humanitarian and municipal perspective.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the best way to treat the symptoms is to set up several shelters</p>
<p>in the two concessions to accommodate these street refugees.</p>
<p>If this matter can be resolved and carried out, the concession authorities will also be happy to support it. As this matter concerns</p>
<p>relief and public safety, we have specially prepared this letter as a suggestion.</p>
<p>We dare to ask for a public decision to be implemented, and we are extremely eager.</p>
<h3>Principles for Levy Donations from Dance Halls Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>The Modern News Agency reports that since the outbreak of</p>
<p>the war, refugees</p>
<p>from the war zones have been fleeing</p>
<p>to Shanghai. Although various charities have tried to send them back,</p>
<p>the number of refugees stranded in the concession areas and the Nanshi refugee area</p>
<p>still amounts to 100,000 to this day. The monthly cost of living is more than 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, in order to care for the refugees and coordinate relief efforts,</p>
<p>organized the Refugee Relief Association. Since its establishment, various industries have responded enthusiastically,</p>
<p>and they have all actively paid the disaster relief donations. The hotel and restaurant industry and various entertainment venues</p>
<p>have all added refugee donations, and customers are also happy to pay.</p>
<p>Now, the association believes that the dance hall industry alone is lacking, and various parties</p>
<p>believe that it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, on the 6th of this month, all dance hall managers in the city were convened</p>
<p>to discuss adding</p>
<h3>Part of Punan Ferry Open</h3>
<p>Due to the outbreak of guerrilla warfare there, all ferries in Punan</p>
<p>were closed and ships were suspended.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation has eased slightly, and some of the ferries</p>
<p>have been opened. Ferries have resumed operation at Wangjiadu,</p>
<p>Zhagang, and Dujiaxing, etc. However, inspections at the ferry are very strict, and there are few passengers.</p>
<p>Ferries at Deshenggang, Yangsiqiao, and Lutanmiao, etc. are still closed, and ships have not resumed operation.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Town Office Urges Burial of Exposed Corpses and Coffins</h3>
<p>Since the start of the war in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, the local area has been peaceful due to the lack of military relations.</p>
<p>Many residents from nearby cities and villages have moved there to avoid the war.</p>
<p>The number of deaths has also been quite high. The corpses and coffins of refugees from other provinces are piled up behind the Hongmiao Temple in the west of the town and in various tomb sites in the east of the town.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous people even steal coffin boards to sell as fuel, resulting in exposed corpses</p>
<p>being dragged and devoured by wild dogs, and their remains scattered in the fields, which is a tragic sight that cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>The town office, due to concerns about sanitation, issued a notice yesterday urging relocation and burial, with a deadline of one week.</p>
<p>After the deadline, workers will be hired to bury them all in order to tidy up the city and emphasize morality.</p>
<h3>Foreigner from Chongqing Talks About Wang Jingwei's Quiet Departure from the Country Took a Commercial Plane from Chongqing Passengers on the Same Plane Were Unaware Chen Gongbo Sent a Letter to Zhang Qun Saying He Was Going to Yunnan to Give a Speech</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a foreigner who had just arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing said that the details of Wang Jingwei's departure from Chongqing</p>
<p>were mostly not detailed in telegrams. According to him, when he left Sichuan for Yunnan, he took a commercial plane.</p>
<p>Among the passengers on the same plane were Gong Zhimu, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education, and Fu Sinian and other six people from the education sector.</p>
<p>Gong and others did not initially know that Wang was preparing to leave the country due to illness. Wang only stayed briefly in Hanoi</p>
<p>and then flew to Hanoi. Zhou Fohai, former Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Senator Tao Xisheng also went to Hanoi to meet him.</p>
<p>It is now reported that Zhou and Tao are still living with Wang. Before Chen Gongbo, a member of the Sichuan Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee, left Chongqing, he only sent letters to Zhang Qun and Ye Chucang, saying that</p>
<p>he planned to go to Yunnan to give a speech and would return to Chongqing after staying for a week. It is now known that Chen Gongbo has transferred from Hanoi to</p>
<p>Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Economic Establishment of Large-Scale Iron Smelting Plant Purchase of High-Temperature Equipment for Active Smelting Ten Tons of Refined Iron Per Day Iron Prices Will Not Rise Again</h3>
<p>Iron is the main raw material for light and heavy industry.</p>
<p>Although China produces abundant iron, the output of refined iron</p>
<p>has not been widely supplied</p>
<p>because there is still no high-temperature iron smelting furnace.</p>
<p>Before the fall of Hankou, the demand for pig iron in various places</p>
<p>was mostly supplied by the Liuhegou Pig Iron Company in Hankou.</p>
<p>Since the abandonment of Wuhan, the source of pig iron</p>
<p>has suddenly become scarce, so iron</p>
<p>prices have soared, rising from more than 300</p>
<p>yuan per ton to more than 700 yuan per ton. It is learned that the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs</p>
<p>has now established an iron smelting plant in Sichuan and purchased</p>
<p>a high-temperature smelting furnace capable of smelting ten tons per day.</p>
<p>Before the abandonment of Wuhan, it had tried</p>
<p>to transport out more than 1,000 tons of pig iron. At the same time,</p>
<p>it is actively planning to develop iron mines. Therefore,</p>
<p>there is no need to worry about the shortage of refined iron required by the people in the future,</p>
<p>and iron prices may not rise again.</p>
<h3>Eastern Zhejiang Officially Opens to Navigation Not Far Away Navigation Measures Will Be Promulgated Soon Passenger Transport Can Be Expected to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>It is now reported that the headquarters of the Tenth Army Group,</p>
<p>in order to effectively rectify shipping and transportation in eastern Zhejiang,</p>
<p>convened relevant groups to hold a shipping affairs</p>
<p>conference. After the opening, the authorities have implemented the decisions of the conference</p>
<p>one after another. According to news from the shipping industry, the formal navigation measures for eastern Zhejiang,</p>
<p>in addition to adopting the opinions of various parties and the suggestions</p>
<p>of Zhang Guiling, Deputy Commander of the Yongfang Defense, were discussed in detail</p>
<p>and will be promulgated and implemented soon. After the suspension of direct shipping and combined bay shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, goods</p>
<p>between Shanghai and Ningbo have been transported by the shipping industry through combined transport of goods</p>
<p>to adjust the situation. Combined passenger transport has not been implemented due to the failure of</p>
<p>flights between Shanghai, Taiwan, and Ningbo to connect with each other. The shipping industry is now actively adjusting</p>
<p>flights, so combined passenger transport can be expected to be realized in the shortest time.</p>
<h3>Passport Issuance Requires Certification from Institutions</h3>
<p>After the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai took over the issuance of passports, the procedures for overseas Chinese to obtain passports for going abroad are extremely simple.</p>
<p>As long as the form is filled out in detail and there is no time-consuming investigation,</p>
<p>the passport can be processed within four to seven days. If</p>
<p>the date of departure by car or boat is filled out, it can be processed as soon as possible. However, the important condition is the guarantee. According to the regulations of the ministry, the qualification for the guarantee,</p>
<p>if they are government agency personnel, must have an official letter from the agency. If they are people from the four villages, they must have an official letter from the district village office. If they are Hong Kong people,</p>
<p>they must have a guarantee from a chamber of commerce, local chamber of commerce, bank, limited company, lawyer, or a person of good reputation.</p>
<p>Then it can be quickly issued. Most of the delays are due to the issue of guarantee qualifications,</p>
<p>not due to delays in the procedures of the person handling the matter. Most of the passports issued by the office</p>
<p>are taken to Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces via Guangzhou Bay.</p>
<p>As for the French consulate, in order to facilitate travelers, travelers going to or through Vietnam can apply to the consulate for a passport.</p>
<p>However, recently, the Chinese government has set up a passport issuance office in Hong Kong, so there is no need to do this. Therefore, the consulate has also recently announced</p>
<p>the suspension of issuance. Anyone who wants to go to or through Vietnam to the mainland of China must have a Chinese passport</p>
<p>before they can request a visa from the consulate.</p>
<h3>After the Promulgation of the Public Treasury Law Trial Implementation from July Implementation in January Next Year</h3>
<p>After the National Government promulgated the Public Treasury Law on June 9 last year, it stipulated that the public treasuries of all levels of government in the Republic of China and the handling of their affairs shall be</p>
<p>handled in accordance with this law. The organs that manage cash, bills, securities, and other property for the government are called</p>
<p>public treasuries. The public treasury of the central government is called the national treasury,</p>
<p>with the Ministry of Finance as the主管機關(chief administrative organ). The public treasury of the provincial government is called the provincial treasury,</p>
<p>with the Department of Finance as the主管機關(chief administrative organ). The public treasury of the municipal government is called the municipal treasury,</p>
<p>and the public treasury of the county government is called the county treasury, each with its</p>
<p>Finance Bureau as the主管機關(chief administrative organ). If there is no Finance</p>
<p>Bureau, the municipal or county government is the主管機關(chief administrative organ). As for the date and</p>
<p>region of implementation of the law, it will be determined by order. It is reported that in order to implement the</p>
<p>unified collection and payment of the whole country and reorganize finances, it has been decided to trial implement the Public Treasury Law from July 1 to the end of December</p>
<p>this year, and formally implement it from New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>International Relief Society Effectively Handles Production for Refugees More Than 1,300 Refugees Participating in Production Monthly Wages of Approximately 3,900 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Japanese Military Police Transferred Gambling Dens Suffer Immensely Pudong Yongli Club Closed After Opening for Only One Day</h3>
<p>The Xiaochu unit of the Japanese military police in Yangjiazai, Pudong,</p>
<p>was completely transferred to another location the day before yesterday. Yesterday, another batch of new military police was transferred in,</p>
<p>but the number was smaller than before, only more than 20 people, taking over the duties of the former Xiaochu</p>
<p>unit. However, the Pudong gambling den, the Fali Club, which had just opened for the first day</p>
<p>the day before yesterday, suffered a major blow. On the first day of business, it made a profit of 60 yuan,</p>
<p>paid 40 yuan to someone, and the remaining 20 yuan was not enough to cover the day's expenses, resulting in a heavy loss.</p>
<p>It was forced to close yesterday. It is said that although the gambling den obtained permission from the old military police of the Japanese side,</p>
<p>the new military police cannot recognize it. Therefore, some ronin bosses felt extremely embarrassed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a report from the Kunming Post Office that due to the blockage of postal routes and inconvenience of transportation in the area,</p>
<p>parcels sent to various places are piled up like mountains. All large parcels sent to the area will be temporarily suspended for acceptance from today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's large parcel dispatch office issued a notice stating, "From today, parcels sent to Kunming in this area,</p>
<p>except for personal and medicine parcels, will be temporarily suspended for acceptance. It is also learned that large medicine parcels transferred from Beihai to Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and the two Guang provinces have not resumed acceptance.</p>
<h3>US Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai Anchored for Ten Days to Return Home</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reported that the US Navy transport ship Henderson arrived in Shanghai yesterday (6th) morning after being anchored in Qinhuangdao for several days and unloading supplies for the US Marine Corps stationed in China.</p>
<p>It plans to be anchored for ten days and is scheduled to sail to San Francisco on the 16th of this month. It is reported that 50 sailors from the US Pacific Fleet and</p>
<p>the Asian Fleet will board the ship to return home. The ship brought 90 replacement soldiers when it sailed to the Far East, and in addition to the US sailors, 100</p>
<p>US Marines will also board the ship to return home. According to the Henderson, it was delayed</p>
<p>by 24 hours due to bad weather and only arrived in Shanghai on December 31. After the soldiers who came to serve in the Fourth Marine Corps disembarked, the</p>
<p>ship set sail north to Qinhuangdao and returned south to Shanghai on January 3.</p>
<h3>Foreign Mail to China Rerouted Through Fujian Province To Avoid Illegal Inspection by the Shanghai Bureau Southwest Mail Rerouted Through Vietnam</h3>
<p>Mail from various foreign countries to Zhejiang, Anhui,</p>
<p>Jiangxi, and other provinces used to be transshipped through the Shanghai Postal</p>
<p>Administration. According to a quick report from the Quick News Agency, the Postal</p>
<p>Administration of the Ministry of Communications, in order to prevent foreign mail</p>
<p>to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other three provinces from being inspected</p>
<p>by the so-called "inspectors" dispatched by Japan through Shanghai transshipment,</p>
<p>notified the postal authorities of various countries</p>
<p>that foreign mail to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi,</p>
<p>and other provinces would no longer be transshipped through Shanghai, but would be transshipped through Fujian Province to avoid inspection.</p>
<p>This measure has been implemented recently.</p>
<p>As for mail from foreign countries to the southwestern provinces, it has also been rerouted through Annan and Burma due to the fall of Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Price Increase in the Crate Industry</h3>
<p>The raw materials used by the crate industry in this city for making crates have always been</p>
<p>construction boards (produced in Fujian) and Wenzhou Tanhu boards. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, transportation has been disrupted.</p>
<p>The original price of construction boards was 4 yuan and 2 jiao per zhang, and the price of Wenzhou Tanhu boards was 2 yuan and 8 jiao. By the end of last year, the price had actually risen</p>
<p>to 8 yuan per zhang for construction boards and 5 yuan and several jiao per zhang for Tanhu boards. Therefore, the industry has been greatly affected.</p>
<p>It has already convened the industry to hold a meeting and decided to implement a price increase on the 15th of this month</p>
<p>to maintain capital. It has also agreed to unify prices and notify the industry to comply.</p>

<h3>Tongren Hospital Social Services Department: Seeking Parents to Claim Child Left at Hospital; Warning to the Child's Parents to Quickly Reclaim Their Child</h3>
<p>The Pediatrics Department of Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road in this city treated a sick child named Chen Quanfu, only one year old, on November 19th of last year. At that time, the parents left the sick child at the hospital for treatment, claiming to reside in a bungalow at Kangjia Bridge, Caojiadu. They said they would reclaim the child upon recovery. However, since being admitted, it has been over a month and a half. Although the child has long recovered, the parents have not come to visit and have since disappeared. The Social Services Department of Tongren Hospital sent personnel to Kangjia Bridge, Caojiadu, for investigation, but the address turned out to be fictitious, and the investigation yielded no results. The Social Services Department of Tongren Hospital hereby publishes this notice, warning the parents of Chen Quanfu to quickly reclaim their child. Medical expenses will not be an issue. If the parents ignore this notice and fail to reclaim their child within one week from the date of publication, their intention to abandon the child will be apparent. The Social Services Department of Tongren Hospital will have no choice but to arrange for the child's care in the best possible way. It is hoped that the parents will consider this carefully and not regret it in the future.</p>
<p>The Golden Gate International Exposition in the United States is scheduled to open on February 18th. Due to the ongoing war of resistance, the Chinese government has not officially sent personnel to participate. However, overseas Chinese in the Americas, in conjunction with well-known manufacturers from Hong Kong and Shanghai, are participating under the name of Chinese merchants. They are preparing the "Chinese Merchants Exhibition Hall" at the exposition and have specially appointed Director Kuang Guangyin to return to China to collect items for participation. It is learned that Mr. Kuang has largely completed the collection of items for the exposition. In South China, the items include Guangdong embroidery, antiques, calligraphy, and other valuable handicrafts. There will also be golden dragons, silver dragons, lion dances, Cantonese opera, and other celebratory performances. In Shanghai, Mr. Lu [blank] is responsible for the collection, and the items will soon be ready for shipment to Hong Kong and then to the United States. The first batch of items from South China departed on December 30th of last year, and the second batch was shipped on the 4th of this month. The third batch of collected items will be shipped on the 13th. In the near future, the collection will be further expanded and scoured. Overseas Chinese in the Americas have also appointed Dr. Feng Jintang (transliteration) to return to China to select beautiful women to participate in managing the items. Mr. Chen Yingsun (transliteration), a well-known porcelain merchant from Shanghai, will also travel to San Francisco at the end of the month to participate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council: 1938 Administrative Review (Continued): Bund Wharf</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors and the Works Committee of this Council discussed the fees for using the Bund pontoon wharf, and a charging scheme was approved for trial implementation until the end of June. As the original scheme was found to be unsuitable, it was resolved to revise and amend it, with the amended scheme coming into effect on July 1st. A charging office was set up on the Bund.</p>
<h3>Factory Management</h3>
<p>In the second half of last year, various industries in this city gradually showed signs of recovery. Many new factories were established in the western district. The Industrial Section of this Council took this opportunity to firmly instruct factory owners to comply with the principles set by this Council and, where possible, to provide dormitories for workers. The construction and installation of boilers were carefully monitored by this Council. Several sessions of the boiler operator training course were held with good results. Ms. Xing De, Director of the Industrial Section, participated in the International Labour Conference in Geneva during her leave last year and visited the representatives attending the conference and the staff of the International Labour Office, reporting on this Council's efforts to improve factory conditions in the past five years.</p>
<h3>Mui Tsai Problem</h3>
<p>In August last year, this Council received a report from the League of Nations Committee of Experts on Slavery, forwarded by the Senior Consul. The Committee expressed its appreciation for this Council's work on the mui tsai problem. Ms. Xing De, Director of the Industrial Section of this Council, visited Geneva, London, and Ottawa to discuss the mui tsai issue with experts studying social problems. A detailed account of this matter is included in the Industrial Section's report.</p>
<h3>War Service Medal</h3>
<p>At the end of the year before last, the Council decided to award medals to the Merchant Corps, Police Force, and Fire Brigade personnel who served during the war in the year before last. The awarding rules were drafted by a special committee during the year before last. The recipients are limited to those who were in uniform and served during the war.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>As the Nanjing Road Public Library building was small and had various shortcomings, this Council decided to move the library to a new location on Beijing Road. The new premises are more spacious, and the lighting and ventilation are better than the old location. The Library Committee appointed members to inspect the interior of the library and report their opinions from time to time.</p>
<h3>Refugee Lottery</h3>
<p>At the end of May last year, French nationals who were issuing refugee charity lottery tickets requested permission from this Council to sell the tickets within the International Settlement. This Council has a policy of prohibiting the issuance of lottery tickets, but due to the special circumstances of the issuance of these charity lottery tickets, permission was granted to sell them within the International Settlement, provided that the sales method was satisfactory to this Council.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Fair</h3>
<p>The temple fair held near Jing'an Temple every year was not allowed to be held last year due to the tense situation. Later, out of consideration for the difficulties faced by merchants, designated private gardens were allowed to set up stalls and conduct business.</p>
<h3>British Military Cemetery</h3>
<p>There is a British military cemetery on Minguo Road in the southern city, where British soldiers who died in the Taiping Rebellion are buried. The cemetery has been in disrepair for many years, and the cemetery caretaker was forced to leave during the war in the southern city in the year before last. Therefore, this Council, the British Consul in Shanghai, and the British military authorities agreed to relocate the remains in the cemetery to the Hongqiao Cemetery.</p>
<h3>Band</h3>
<p>During the meeting of foreign taxpayers last year, someone proposed to disband the band, but this proposal was ultimately rejected. The band continued to hold open-air concerts and symphony concerts as usual during the year. The French Concession authorities expressed their appreciation for the band, and the Italian government subsidized the band with 50,000 Italian lire.</p>

<h3>Rongchang Gambling Den Bombing: Three Gamblers Injured</h3>
<p>At 4:35 PM yesterday, a bomb was planted in the Rongchang Club gambling den at No. 8 Yifeng Lane, the end of Jessfield Road in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area. The bomb exploded, sending shrapnel flying, injuring three gamblers who were in the immediate vicinity. They were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. An investigation revealed that the three injured were Zhu Jiazhen, 38, from Pudong, residing at No. 50 Hongshou Lane, Wenzhou Road, injured in the left foot; Feng Fu, 33, from Guangdong, residing at No. 23 Tongxing Lane, Sima Road, injured in the leg; and Wang Shengkang, 37, from Ningbo, residing at No. 13 Hexing Lane, Avenue Edward VII, injured in the leg.</p>
<h3>Two Robbery Cases</h3>
<p>At around 9:30 PM last night, several men suddenly broke into Room 403 on the fourth floor of the New Asia Hotel on Guizhou Road. They questioned the guest in a peculiar manner, asking if his exit permit was signed there. The guest, finding the situation strange and completely fabricated, was about to demand an explanation when the men pulled out handguns, threatening him to remain silent. They then began to search the room, and it was only then that the guest realized he was being robbed. Helpless, he allowed the robbers to do as they pleased. As a result, 157 yuan in cash was stolen. By the time he regained his freedom and attempted to pursue the robbers, it was too late. He immediately reported the incident to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and gave chase separately. At No. 632 Avenue Edward VII, three robbers suddenly arrived to commit robbery at around 6:30 PM yesterday evening. Two robbers, armed with guns, were responsible for keeping watch and acting as lookouts, while the unarmed robber entered the house and looted valuables, including jewelry and cash, worth over 280 yuan, before fleeing in different directions. The victim was unable to pursue them and immediately reported the loss to the police station in charge, requesting them to investigate.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organizations Set Up Checkpoints: Self-Collected and Self-Used; So-Called Administrative Sovereignty Still Belongs to the Pacification Team</h3>
<p>Although the puppet organizations in the occupied areas of this city have a so-called "Shanghai Special Municipality," their administration is still largely characterized by abnormal fragmentation, especially in the southern city and the western district. Although the police authority once changed the "mobile police" run by the former "Autonomous Association" into "Great Road Police," a special detective team was still established under the auspices of the Pacification Team to usurp the authority of the puppet police bureau. Regarding taxes, the puppet "Administrative Office," a substitute for the southern city "Autonomous Association," has set up checkpoints at Minguo Road, Xinkai River, South Wharf, Bund, Xietu Road, and Pingyin Bridge, and has also dispatched more than 20 mobile tax collectors. In the western district, the "Maintenance Association" has set up checkpoints at Caohejing, Hongqiao Road, Beixinjing, Fahua, and Yujidun. All the revenue collected is used by themselves and not reported. Special agents are stationed in the northern city, while puppet "Self-Defense Corps" are stationed in the western district, all with guns and ranks. Fu Xiaoan issued an order some time ago to unify the authority and merge the operations in order to weaken the abuse of power by all parties, placing the puppet "Administrative Director" and others in a position of idleness similar to that of a former district chief. However, the southern city and the western district, relying on external support, have ignored the order. It is unknown how this will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Liuhe Yanglinkou: Pirates Attempt to Rob Merchant Ships; Li Bei and Heng Xi Escape Alertly; Pirate Ship Opens Fire, Killing One Passenger and Injuring Two</h3>
<p>At around 4:30 PM yesterday, as the foreign merchant ship Li Bei was entering the river mouth at Yanglinkou outside Liuhe, it was suddenly encountered by a pirate ship, which ordered it to stop. The captain of the ship, realizing that they had encountered pirates, was exceptionally alert and immediately accelerated, pushing the ship forward to escape. The pirate ship chased after it but was unable to catch up and fired a volley of shots as a warning. As bullets flew everywhere, one bullet struck Zhao Xian'gen (29 years old, from Jiangbei), a passenger on the ship, in the chest. Blood gushed out, and he was barely breathing. Shortly thereafter, the Heng Xi also passed through the area and was also fired upon by the pirate ship. Passengers Xu Haicai (15 years old) was hit in the left foot by a stray bullet, and Lou Renhua (25 years old) was shot through the right leg, fortunately not in a vital area. Both ships eventually escaped and arrived safely in Shanghai, both at around 12:00 AM. The injured were taken to Renji Hospital. However, Zhao Xian'gen's injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The remaining injured were hospitalized for treatment. The hospital reported the incident to the Central Police Department for investigation.</p>

<h3>Southern City Puppet "Court" Has No Development; Tu Fu Requests Abolition of the Puppet "Judicial Office" Due to Internal Strife Over Personnel Matters</h3>
<p>Since the puppet "Local Court" in the southern city was established with Tu Fu as the puppet president and Kang Handong as the puppet "Chief Prosecutor," it was expected that the income from litigation fees would be used to cover expenses. However, since the opening, not even a single petition form (50 cents each) has been sold, so there has been no case at all. This is because the puppet "Judicial Office" of the puppet "Municipal Government" in Pudong still exists. The southern city "Court" is not connected to the puppet "Municipal Government," resulting in no development at all. Tu Fu and others are extremely anxious and have petitioned the puppet "Ministry of Justice" to handle the matter. It is said that after the puppet "Ministry of Justice" contacted the puppet "Executive Yuan," a "directive" was issued to the puppet "Municipal Government" to abolish the puppet "Judicial Office" by the end of this month. However, the puppet "Court" does not need the personnel of the puppet "Judicial Office," resulting in major internal strife.</p>
<p>The puppet "Reformed Government's" Ministry of Justice has been promoting the restoration of the Shanghai "Local Court" for a long time, but it has not yet materialized. It has now been found that the buildings of the Shanghai Local Court on Chezhan Road in the western district, except for most of the buildings that were destroyed by fire, the detention center, gate, and buildings in the back are still relatively intact. Yesterday, someone passing through Chezhan Road noticed a new wooden sign hanging next to the iron gate of the detention center, about four to five feet high and seven to eight feet wide, with the white characters "Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court Detention Center" written on a black background. It seemed newly written. The iron gate was half-open, and five or six Chinese people wearing long robes and felt hats were sitting on the porch, looking very bored.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Municipal Government" Advisory Group Established to Control Various Puppets</h3>
<p>After the former Japanese Nishimura Guidance Group of the puppet "Municipal Government" was disbanded due to dishonorable incidents, the Japanese are now using an "advisory" system for all guidance matters, which is essentially the same thing under a different name. They are still manipulating the puppet "Municipal Government" behind the scenes. It is learned that the new advisory group has been established. In terms of personnel, in addition to adding some new members, some old members have also been reappointed. For example, Nishida Katsunori, an advisor to the puppet "Municipal Government," was originally a guidance officer in the compilation office of the puppet "Municipal Government" under the Nishimura Guidance Group and has a close relationship with Su Xiwu, the puppet "Secretary-General," making him a headache for Fu Xiaoan. Kita Shoichi, advisor to the puppet "Finance Bureau," was originally a guidance officer in the former "Finance Bureau" and is also Su Xiwu's old superior. Miyanari Hoshi, advisor to the puppet "Education Bureau," was a guidance officer in the education section of the former puppet "Governor's Office." Miyazaki Sadayuki, advisor to the puppet "Social Affairs Bureau," originally belonged to the former puppet "Nanshi District Office" as a guidance officer. Kusano Hideyuki, advisor to the puppet "Youth Corps," originally belonged to the former Kawakawa puppet "District Office" as a guidance officer. These people are experienced and know the ropes well, making it easy for them to control the various puppets. Therefore, it is just a dream for Fu Xiaoan and others to try to seize the opportunity to gain some freedom of action.</p>
<h3>Dongshi of the Houren Shantang in the Yinxiang District Sues for Century-Old Accounts, Alleging Embezzlement by Former Dongshi; The Defendant Is Ordered to Respond in Detail Before Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Shen Jingfu, Chairman of the Houren Shantang in the Yinxiang District of Shanghai, recently hired attorney Xu Jiashi to criminally sue former Chairman Wang Zengyou, Zhou Wenzhi, and Dongshi Wang Juchuan and Lu Jingtang for allegedly embezzling more than nine mu of land, valued at tens of thousands of gold, donated by various philanthropists to the Shantang in the past. Huang Risheng of the Third Criminal Court continued the hearing this morning. The plaintiff's attorney, Xu Jiashi, submitted the inspection forms copied by both parties during the adjournment, stating that according to the plaintiff Shen Jingfu's form, there were two plots of land, each five mu, donated by philanthropists between the 28th year of Daoguang and the 5th year of Xianfeng, which were not listed in the defendants' inspection form. Furthermore, the 60 dan of white rice purchased by the Shantang through Yuda Medical Garden in 1933 was also not included in the accounts. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the Shantang had been established for a century, and all the properties during the late Qing Dynasty were managed by the late General Dong Wang Jiebo. Wang Zengyou took over in 1912 without making any changes. The accounts are also old and have been around for a long time. Furthermore, the 60 dan of white rice were previously used for issuing rice tickets, and attorney Huang Jiyuan represented them. The court ordered the case to be adjourned and a special court hearing to be held on the afternoon of the 17th, ordering the defendants to respond in detail to the listed inspection forms before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Police Bureau" Attempts to Separate from the Puppet "Government"</h3>
<p>The puppet "Municipal Police Bureau," in an attempt to separate itself from the puppet Municipal Government, has requested and been approved by the Japanese to move back to its original location at the former Municipal Police Bureau on Penglai Road in the southern city, citing the fact that its current location is in a remote corner of the city center, making it difficult to implement its regulations. It is said that the move is scheduled for the 15th of this month. However, the site is currently occupied by the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, and negotiations for its relocation are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Traveler Commits Suicide; Body Identified; Body Handed Over to Charitable Organization for Burial Pending Relatives' Claim</h3>
<p>Qian Damin, a local Shanghai resident, 25 years old, went to the Yunzhou Hotel at No. 19, Lane 99, Dongxin Street in the French Concession alone at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday and checked into Room 30. Two hours later, he went out and returned to the hotel to sleep at 4:00 AM the next morning. For unknown reasons, he suddenly had a suicidal thought and secretly swallowed mishaer to commit suicide. The tea attendant Chen Linfu discovered the poisoning and informed the front desk, who reported it to the police station. Qian was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. He died at 6:00 AM. The police station took the body to the body identification room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch and reported it to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the site and confirmed that the deceased had committed suicide by taking poison. As there was no way to find or contact the relatives, he ordered the body to be handed over to a charitable organization for burial, pending relatives' claim.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Shelter Recruits Male and Female Teachers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association recently plans to establish a larger-scale shelter in the Shanghai West area. All preparations are complete. Yesterday, 30 male and female teachers were recruited for the shelter at the Fourth Zhonghua Vocational Supplementary School, third floor of the Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII. Cai Renbao, Yao Huiquan, Shen Guanglie, Li Chucai, and others proctored the exam. There was an unusually enthusiastic response, with more than 160 applicants, mostly normal school graduates. Physical examinations are scheduled to take place at the same location today (9th).</p>
<h3>Sanitation Company Inspector Injures Father and Son Laborers over Competition for Business; The Court Orders Dai Yongshou to be Re-Examined After Recovery</h3>
<p>Dai Shoushou, a 67-year-old Jiangbei man, and his son, Dai Wenguang, who lives in a straw shed on Makien Road and works as a night soil cart driver, were lured into an alley by several people at 5:00 AM on January 27th of last year while heading to the Sanyi Silk Factory on Macau Road to empty buckets. The assailants used axes to injure both the father and son, causing them to fall to the ground. The assailants then fled in different directions. The Chinese and foreign detectives from the Qitu Road police station arrived after hearing the alarm and transported the two victims to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Dai Yongshou's injuries were quite severe and he was barely breathing. After investigation, the police learned that the case was committed by Chen Fengyi, Chen Buchuan, Sha Yaozhang, and others, sanitation company inspectors who live on Jilong Road, over competition for business. The police secretly arrested Chen and the other two and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The case was continued in the Third Criminal Court yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that although Dai Yongshou's head and leg injuries had been treated by a doctor and were not life-threatening, he was unable to stand. He requested that the hospital lift him to the dock for identification. Lying on a listening chair, he was questioned by Judge Huang Risheng, who immediately left his seat and approached Dai. According to Dai, he and his son Wenguang and daughter-in-law were working at the Sanyi Silk Factory at the time. He saw the defendant Chen Buchuan calling his son Wenguang into an alley to talk. After a while, he heard his son calling for help. He immediately went forward, and Chen Buchuan grabbed both of his hands, while Sha Yaozhang pulled out a sharp axe and injured him, causing him to fall to the ground. When questioned, the defendants denied the accusations. Two lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, were appointed to represent them. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody and re-examined after Dai Yongshou's injuries have healed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern City Forcibly Demolish Civilian Houses to Build Forts on Fangbang Road; Newly Arrived Japanese Troops are Violent; Residents are Beaten and Fear Them Like Tigers and Wolves</h3>
<p>Since the Wan Zhu Elementary School on Luxiangyuan Road in the Jiudian area of Shanghai City was occupied by the Japanese army as a garrison, a passage has been left at the Fangbang Road entrance on the south side, where Japanese soldiers and puppet police are stationed. Residents entering and leaving, regardless of gender, must take off their hats, bow to the Japanese soldiers, and present their resident's permit. The troops stationed there have not been transferred back since they were transferred to the Qianxian front for reinforcements. More than 100 newly arrived soldiers recently transferred from Japan are stationed there. These new soldiers are all under 20 years old, have violent tempers, and often beat citizens. Residents fear them like tigers. Recently, the commander of the Japanese troops, feeling that the defense was tight and that the road was too narrow to develop, hired workers to demolish more than a dozen houses on the opposite side, including a certain family's nunnery (all female nuns) and the Fuxing Timber Yard, in order to widen the road. They also built two circular forts, about five or six feet high and more than ten feet in circumference, at the north and south ends, using bricks and cement. Gun holes were built on the north, south, and west sides, and machine guns were placed. Japanese soldiers are stationed inside the forts. Sandbags and other obstacles are placed outside the forts for defense. All have now been completed.</p>

<h3>The Construction of China's Wartime Economy - A Summary at the End of the 27th Year (1938) -</h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>(1) Three Principles and Eight Guidelines</p>
<p>The greatest goal of wartime economic construction is to achieve victory. However, economic phenomena are complex and multifaceted. Without principles as a guide, there is no way to proceed. Therefore, the Manifesto of the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang expounded on the relationship between the War of Resistance and national reconstruction based on the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People, complementing and assisting each other. In the Principle of People's Livelihood, it was strongly argued that the greatest purpose of Japan's aggression was to carry out economic plunder by relying on military force. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, China should first maintain the rural economy to develop productivity. The economic strength that is directly and indirectly related to the War of Resistance with the emerging industries is profound and enticing, and the strength of the entire government and the entire people must be used to seek revival. From this, three principles were put forward: First, to engage in the accumulation of productive capital and the revitalization of industry with extreme frugality and hard work; Second, all plans for industrial revival should be focused on seeking victory in the War of Resistance, eliminating the differences in interests and feelings due to their status or occupation on weekdays, and moving towards a common goal; Third, in economic construction, the government must implement planned economy based on the creed of the Principle of People's Livelihood: For enterprises suitable for state operation, the state should raise capital and engage in operation, so as to make them tend towards rationalization of production; for enterprises suitable for private operation, private individuals should invest and operate them, and under the national reorganization plan, they should be guided and encouraged by the government.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the War of Resistance will be won and the nation will be built, seven categories of guidelines for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction were formulated, of which the economic ones were further divided into eight types: First, economic construction should be centered on military affairs, while at the same time paying attention to improving the people's livelihood. With this goal, a planned economy should be implemented, and investment by people at home and abroad should be encouraged to expand wartime production; Second, make every effort to develop the rural economy, encourage cooperation, regulate food supply, and reclaim wasteland and dredge waterways; Third, develop mineral resources, establish the foundation of heavy industry, encourage the operation of light industry, and develop handicrafts in various places; Fourth, implement a wartime tax system and thoroughly reform financial administration; Fifth, control banking business and adjust industrial and commercial activities accordingly; Sixth, consolidate the legal currency, control foreign exchange, and manage import and export goods to stabilize finance; Seventh, reorganize the transportation system, organize water, land and air combined transportation, and build more railways and highways, and open up more air routes; Eighth, strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from monopolizing, hoarding, speculating and manipulating prices, and implement a commodity price control system.</p>
<p>In the past year, the motivation for China's economic construction has been in line with these three principles, and the matters of economic construction have also followed these eight guidelines. Now, the important items will be discussed separately for the reference and study of those who are concerned about China's wartime economy.</p>
<p>(2) Financial Construction</p>
<p>In recent years, China's financial construction has made significant progress. The income tax created in October of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) has added an important source of wartime finance. Since the official outbreak of the August 13th Incident (1937), the National Government, in order to encourage donations for national salvation, issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds, which were fully issued and have now been sold out. At the same time, it successively promulgated nine articles of the "Temporary Measures for the Collection of Stamp Tax in Extraordinary Times," five articles of the "Measures for Additional Levy on Native Wine and the Implementation of Native Tobacco Silk Tax," and seven articles of the "Temporary Regulations for Export and Transit Tax." However, as the war zone expands day by day, the three taxes of customs, salt and unified tax, which used to be the main source of tax revenue, can hardly be collected. For example, according to the Social and Economic Monthly Report, the tax revenue of the ports preserved in the 27th year of the Republic (1938) is estimated to be 80 million yuan. The government must find other sources of revenue to subsidize it. The methods of raising funds are nothing more than increasing taxes or establishing new taxes, raising domestic and foreign debts, and issuing more paper money. As for increasing taxes, most of the places where taxes used to be collected have become war zones, and taxes cannot be collected at all, let alone increased. As for increasing the issuance of paper money, it is enough to create the evil of inflation and disrupt wartime finance, and there is nothing worse than this. Therefore, to cope with this huge wartime expenditure, the only things that can be used for subsidy and avoid the burden of inequality are the establishment of new taxes and the raising of national debt.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Establishment of New Taxes</p>
<p>On October 28th of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the National Government promulgated "Seventeen Articles of the Regulations on Excess Profits Tax in Extraordinary Times," which stipulated that: Any profit-making enterprise with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, including companies, shops, firms, factories, or individuals; profit-making enterprises jointly run by officials and merchants; and temporary profit-making enterprises, whose profits exceed 15% of the capital amount; and the profits from property leases that exceed 12% of the property price, will be subject to tax rates ranging from 10% to 50%. July 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) was set as the starting date for tax collection, and one collection was made every half year, but according to the nature of each industry, it was collected monthly or in one lump sum. On October 6th, the National Government promulgated "Twenty-four Articles of the Temporary Regulations on Inheritance Tax," which stipulated that if a person dies and leaves property within the territory of the Republic of China, and if a citizen of the Republic of China has a residence within the territory of the country and leaves property abroad, taxes shall be levied. The so-called inheritance refers to the movable property, immovable property and all other rights with property value of the deceased. The tax will be levied starting from a total inheritance amount of 5,000 yuan or more, with tax rates ranging from 1% to 50%, and will be implemented from January 1st of the 28th year of the Republic (1939).</p>
<p>(B) Issuance of Public Bonds</p>
<p>The establishment of new taxes is indeed a fundamental plan for wartime finance, but the effectiveness of new taxes is difficult to expect. Therefore, there is a sense of urgency for wartime finance. Moreover, when there is a great need for funds both internally and externally, and the construction of the wartime economy also requires funds. Therefore, in addition to hosting new taxes, we have to borrow public bonds to subsidize them. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national debt borrowed has amounted to 104.7 million yuan in national currency, 10 million yuan in customs gold, 150 million francs in foreign currency, 10.144 million pounds in British gold, and 50 million US dollars. Please see the table below:</p>
<p>In addition to issuing public bonds, local finance has made every effort to consolidate tax revenue, increase tax rates and open up new sources of tax revenue, and reduce government expenditure. Now, let's look at the financial facilities in Guangxi Province, and it is not difficult to draw inferences about the financial situation in other provinces.</p>
<p>Regarding provincial finance, adjust tax revenue according to the nature of national and provincial taxes, and temporarily handle it as before before the adjustment; expand provincial and county public enterprises so that operating income becomes an important source of government revenue; reorganize land and prepare land tax; hold urban land price tax; continue to promote housing tax, provincial and county various taxes and levies, all based on direct collection as a principle, and gradually abolish the system of collection on behalf and contractors; administrative organs should not concurrently collect tax money as a principle, and gradually transfer provincial and county taxes and levies to the tax collection bureau for handling; appropriate a certain amount of tobacco and alcohol tax surcharges and business tax to supplement county local expenses, and determine its distribution standard; restrict the additional surcharges of various taxes and levies, or re-levy taxes and proportional levies in other names; formulate regulations on banks acting as county treasuries, and gradually let banks act as county treasuries. Regarding county finance: order each county to urge districts, townships (towns) and villages (streets) to earnestly assist tax collection agencies in performing their duties; urge each county to continue to investigate land that has not paid taxes and levies, and collect donations according to its land price; urge each county to improve county financial supervision and unify the income, expenditure and custody of grassroots organizations. Regarding accounting and auditing: strictly implement the accounting system; implement township budget and accounting; strictly implement pre- and post-audits; promote on-site audits; actively promote inspection affairs; and pay attention to the general survey of the property of various agencies.</p>
<p>(3) Monetary and Financial Construction</p>
<p>After China implemented the legal currency in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the currency system was unified and finance was stabilized. However, due to political relations in Guangdong and Guangxi, and geographical relations in Yunnan Province, the legal currency could not be promoted. Later, the Guangdong currency system was reformed twice on August 21st of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) and June 20th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) to abolish the mill notes, but the currency system of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces still could not be unified and the legal currency could not be promoted. However, since the outbreak of the war, the central political and economic power has moved into the southwestern provinces, and the currency systems of Yunnan and Guizhou have also been unified. Therefore, China's entire currency system has become more unified due to the war.</p>
<p>In terms of financial construction, at the beginning of the war, there were the promulgation of measures to stabilize finance and the approval of measures to supplement the gold reserve for stabilization, as well as the organization of the joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China and the establishment of the four-bank discount committee. From March to June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), there were successively the implementation of the outline of measures for the control of foreign exchange for import and export and the improvement of local financial institutions, as well as various measures decided by the Hankou Financial Conference.</p>
<p>(A) Guangxi Promotes Legal Currency</p>
<p>When the legal currency was implemented, the use of current mill notes was prohibited. The Guangxi Bank took the opportunity to collect and redeem them. In addition, the provincial government's revenue was insufficient, and it overdrawn a large amount from the bank, and the amount of issuance reached more than 20 million yuan, which was still in short supply. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), military expenses were vast, and more than 30 million yuan was issued. The value of the Guangxi currency continued to fall. Fortunately, it was completed soon, and the provincial government repeatedly asked the central government for relief, but no result was achieved due to disputes over the exchange rate between the Guangxi currency and the legal currency. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was stipulated that two yuan of Guangxi notes were equal to one yuan of legal currency. At the same time, in order to consolidate Guangxi's finance and enrich the preparation of Guangxi notes, the central government issued a consolidation bond of 17 million yuan in December.</p>
<p>(B) Yunnan Promotes Legal Currency</p>
<p>Yunnan Province did not start to promote the legal currency until May of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). All public and private payments and receipts within Yunnan Province were based on the legal currency, and cash was not allowed to be used; the use of legal currency was limited to small notes of one yuan or less in the currency units of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and the old and new notes of the Fu Dian Bank were allowed to be used; those who hold silver coins must exchange them for legal currency at the Fu Dian New Bank and branch offices and legal currency exchange offices within three months from May 15th. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Finance properly finalized the method for collecting and destroying the US-printed banknotes issued by the former Fu Dian Bank, limiting it to one collection and settlement from September 1st to the end of November. However, due to inconvenient transportation, the deadline was extended by three months to the end of February of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), and the Fu Dian New Bank was responsible for the settlement, and it would be invalid after the deadline.</p>
<p>(C) Measures for Controlling Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the measures to stabilize finance, the funds needed by agriculture, commerce, industry and mining should still be maintained. However, in order to cope with the demands, the financial industry originally prepared and tightened loans. Although the Central Reserve Bank of China has not been established, the four government banks have been responsible for rescuing the financial panic in the past. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four banks to handle discounts. At the same time, although the supplementary measures to stabilize finance temporarily prevented the outflow of funds, the incomplete structure failed to achieve universal results, and it was necessary to manage trade and control foreign exchange. In March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the so-called "United Reserve Bank" in Peiping was established, and after issuing unsecured and non-convertible banknotes, China, in order to protect its foreign exchange reserves, issued public bonds on March 14 of the same year as the main means, but this is not enough to be a flaw in China's wartime finance. Judging from the financial measures of various countries during the European War, it is enough to be called.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding Local Finance</p>
<p>As for local finance, it was already very tight in peacetime, and it was even worse in wartime. The method of financial compensation, in addition to some overdrafts from provincial banks, had to resort to public bond policies. We know that about 60 million yuan has been issued. A table is shown as follows. . . Promulgated three articles of the Measures for Application for Foreign Exchange Approval and six articles of the Rules for Application for Purchase of Foreign Exchange, which were subsequently increased. On April 12, the Shanghai Liaison Office was ordered to be established, on April 14, cash was ordered to be provided, on May 7, banks applying for foreign exchange should indicate the name and amount of the importer, and the applying bank was only allowed to take three-sixteenths of a penny handling fee. On June 10, the foreign exchange application form needed to record the name, quantity, amount and origin of the goods in detail. From August 8, it was further advanced to the order approval system. The central bank only sells foreign exchange but does not buy it, which is not a good policy. Moreover, allowing export foreign exchange to operate in the market has a great impact on the future of exchange rates. It should be concentrated in the central bank, which can not only generate foreign exchange positions, but also stabilize the exchange rate of legal currency. Therefore, the implementation of various measures to control export foreign exchange was introduced on April 25. The main measures are four regulations: Measures for Merchants to Transport Goods for Export and Settle Foreign Exchange, Types of Export Goods that Should Be Settled in Foreign Exchange and Their Methods, Matters to be Noted by Relevant Agencies in Investigating Foreign Exchange from Exported Goods, and Matters to be Noted in Implementing "Types of Export Goods that Should Be Settled in Foreign Exchange and Their Methods." It is stipulated that export goods should sell the foreign currency obtained to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications - in fact, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications resell it to the Central Bank. The export goods that should be settled in foreign exchange were gradually expanded to 24 types, and then changed to 23 categories, and later there were deletions. From the New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), it was further reduced to 13 major categories such as tung oil, hog bristles, cowhide, tea, mineral sand, gallnuts, fur, medicinal materials, wool, silk, ramie, casings, and duck feathers.</p>
<p>(D) Outline of Measures to Improve Local Finance</p>
<p>The joint discount of the four banks is enough to enhance the strength of the central and chartered banks in leading financial regulation and adjusting industry and commerce. However, the structure of local financial institutions urgently needs to be improved, and the capital needs to be fully purchased. Therefore, at the end of April, the Ministry of Finance announced ten articles of the Outline of Measures to Improve Local Financial Institutions, and specially approved local financial institutions to receive one-yuan notes and auxiliary coin notes from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, but only on the condition of handling the following businesses related to agriculture, industry, and mining: Operation of agricultural product warehouses, storage of agricultural products, loans for seeds, fertilizers, farming cattle and agricultural tools, loans for farmland water conservancy projects, acceptance or discount of agricultural bills, mortgage of land and real estate that have completed legal procedures and have continued income, mortgage of factory assets, mortgage of industrial raw materials and finished products, acceptance or discount of commercial bills, management, issuance or mortgage of corporate bonds, mortgage of company stocks that pay interest according to regulations, and mortgage of agricultural, forestry, fishery, mining products and daily domestic goods. The intention of this note-receiving method is purely to encourage financial institutions to move towards agriculture, industry, and mining, so as to correct the past imbalance of focusing on commerce, and to make all funds flow into rural areas and be used for production. Those related to agriculture account for as many as five items. The wartime financial stabilization measures are passive restrictions, and the outline of local financial reform is active construction.</p>
<p>(E) Progress of Gold Policy</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned, the progress of gold policy, the establishment of British and American loans, and the extension of Sino-US currency are also important for the construction of China's wartime currency.</p>
<p>Since China nationalized silver in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it has still allowed free gold trading, and only used the customs gold settlement price to control the gold price. However, gold has the qualification of an international monetary material. The more gold reserves, the more relatively it shows the country's strong external purchasing power. Since the War of Resistance, the collection of gold in China has also been one of the important policies of the wartime economy. When the national salvation bond was raised, it was stipulated that it could be used to purchase bonds with gold or gold. On October 10th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Measures for Converting Gold into Legal Currency and Implementation Details were promulgated, stipulating that those who exchange raw gold, gold utensils, etc. for legal currency will be given a handling fee of 3-5%, 6% will be added for national salvation bonds, and 2% per week will be added for those with legal currency. On May 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), gold bonds were issued, stipulating that those who purchase with raw gold and its manufactured products or gold coins, etc. will be issued customs gold bonds according to the amount of pure gold contained, with each customs gold unit converted into 60.1866 milligrams of pure gold. On November 1st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Measures for Supervising Silver Buildings to Collect Gold were promulgated, stipulating that silver buildings should only collect and sell gold and nine-carat gold in the shape of ornaments and utensils. Gold bars, blocks, leaves, placer gold, and mine gold are not allowed to be collected and sold at all. Shops that specialize in buying placer gold and mine gold and do not also operate silver buildings should contact the Central Bank to sign a contract to accept the entrustment to collect gold and sell it all to the Central Bank and shall not sell it privately. In mid-November of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Finance restricted the private smuggling of gold for export and transport to the occupied areas, stipulating that gold and gold ornaments of any shape are prohibited from being transported or transported to the occupied areas unless specially approved by the Ministry of Finance. Looking at the progress of wartime gold policy as a whole, the greatest purpose is to collect folk gold to increase foreign exchange funds. China has to try its best to collect folk gold in order to strengthen the consolidation of legal currency against foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(F) Extension of the Sino-US Currency Agreement and Credit Loans</p>
<p>Raising foreign debt is also an important policy to consolidate the currency value and stabilize finance during wartime. In September of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), China dispatched economic envoys Chen Guangfu and Xi Demao to the United States. After three months, as a result of discussions with the US Treasury Department and private groups, the currency agreement was extended and a credit loan of US$25 million was established. According to a Havasi telegram on December 19, the US Treasury Secretary said that the Sino-US currency agreement signed between China and the United States on July 9, 1937, allows China to use the gold deposited in the United States as collateral to obtain credit loans from the United States. The Central Bank of China has obtained this credit loan under certain conditions to protect the interests of China and the United States in order to facilitate the stability of exchange rates. This agreement will continue to be effective after it expires at the end of 1938. According to a joint statement by the Chinese and US finance ministers on the Sino-US gold and silver exchange agreement on July 9, 1937: Continuing the silver currency agreement signed in May 1936, China will purchase a large amount of gold from the United States under mutually acceptable conditions, and the United States will continue to purchase silver from China in order to help China increase its gold reserves; and both parties will negotiate a method - that is, the Central Bank of China can obtain US exchange under conditions that protect the mutual interests of both parties to stabilize the currency. Therefore, the currency agreement and credit loan are probably the result of the expanded negotiation method. As a result, the stability of the legal currency has been further strengthened. Silver prices fluctuate constantly and do not have the qualification of a world currency. Although various currencies have stopped the gold standard, gold still maintains the function of value storage in international financial relations. The extension of the Sino-US currency agreement can give China various benefits for easily converting silver into gold to enhance the value of the legal currency foreign exchange fund. Secondly, credit loans, whether in the form of currency or goods, can directly and indirectly increase foreign exchange funds and stabilize the value of legal currency.</p>
<p>In addition to the US$25 million credit loan from the United States, the United Kingdom has also approved in principle a credit loan of 10 million pounds to China, the first payment of which is 500,000 pounds, specifically for the purchase of heavy trucks and transportation materials.</p>
<p>(4) Other Economic Constructions (A) Transportation Construction</p>
<p>Today, the western, southern, and northern provinces have become China's base for "Victory in the War of Resistance and Success in National Construction." As a result, China's wartime economic construction is also concentrated in the western, southern, and northern provinces. However, the most important thing in economic construction is the construction of finance, currency, and finance, which is used to promote other economic constructions, and it is determined to be the construction of transportation economy. After the opening of transportation routes, the materials needed for "Victory in the War of Resistance, Success in National Construction, and economic construction" can be enriched, and there is no need to worry about the lack of supply.</p>
<p>The construction of transportation can be divided into two aspects: highways and railways. Regarding highways: there is the Southwest Highway Network, which connects Hunan Province to Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong and other provinces and Myanmar; there is the Northwest Highway Network, which connects Hubei Province to Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces; there is the West-North-South Communication Highway Network, which connects Sichuan Province to Shaanxi and Gansu. Regarding railways: the Qian-Dian (Guiyang to Kunming), Yu-Dian (Xufu to Kunming), and Dian-Myanmar (Kunming to Manyun Town on the Sino-Myanmar border and Bhamo in Myanmar) railways are being built in the southwest. The construction of the Dian-Myanmar Railway has great significance for opening up European international transportation, and can save the travel distance and time between the southwestern provinces and foreign countries.</p>
<p>(B) Construction of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the development of the domestic economy was adjusted, and attention was paid to those related to national defense. On December 22nd of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the National Government promulgated the Wartime Agricultural, Mining, Industrial and Commercial Management Regulations, and the Military Commission managed them in accordance with these regulations. A Trade Adjustment Committee was established under the Military Commission with a fund of 20 million yuan; an Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee with a fund of 30 million yuan; and an Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee with a fund of 10 million yuan, all of which were specially allocated by the Ministry of Finance. In the past year and a half, great achievements have been made.</p>
<p>The Trade Association is now under the Ministry of Finance and has been renamed the Trade Commission. It mainly promotes the export of domestic goods and complements the control of foreign exchange for exports. For example, tea from Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi, silk from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, hog bristles and fur from Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangsu, and tung oil from Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. In mid-June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the Ministry of Finance further formulated measures to promote export trade, divided into: (A) reducing export costs to promote export sales; (B) adjusting domestic commodity prices to maintain domestic production. The first part is a remedial measure because the international market is depressed and the prices of goods are falling, resulting in occasional sales losses for export merchants, which in turn affects the production industry; the second part is a remedial measure because there are differences between the official exchange rate and the black market, and merchants require the sale of foreign exchange at market prices or cash compensation from the government.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Production Adjustment Committee is now under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and is complemented by the Agricultural Bank and the Agricultural Experiment Institute. The Agricultural Bank specializes in handling the lending of funds, and the Agricultural Experiment Institute specializes in improving agricultural production technology. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has formulated measures to subsidize agricultural improvement funds in various provinces. In addition to cooperative undertakings, agricultural improvement agencies can request subsidies for improvement funds in accordance with this law. The Ministries of Finance and Economics have formulated six articles of the Measures to Expand the Scope of Rural Loans, stipulating that financial institutions that receive one-yuan notes and auxiliary coin notes in accordance with the Outline of Measures to Improve Local Financial Institutions, and cooperative treasuries established in accordance with the law, should make full use of various cooperatives to increase various agricultural loans. However, during the War of Resistance, farmers' organizations recognized by lending agencies may also be the object of loans.</p>
<p>The Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee is now also under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and cooperates with the Resources Committee to consolidate the foundation of public and private enterprises. The former assists local private factories in moving from war zones to safe areas to continue operations. It is estimated that more than 300 companies have been assisted by the government to move to inland provinces, of which more than 100 are in Sichuan Province. The latter specializes in state-owned heavy industries in inland provinces - steel, chemical, electricity, machinery, and mining and metallurgy. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs assists a certain agency in building a larger steel plant, which, after completion this summer, can produce considerable steel every day, and also assists a certain private steel manufacturing plant, which will soon be able to produce steel. The Yongli Company, which has experience in handling this industry, is asked to handle the chemical industries such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and Abyssinia. In addition, the National Government promulgated the Industrial Incentive Law and the Special Industrial Interest Guarantee and Subsidy Regulations on June 7th of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), which were reviewed and handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The former stipulates that those who have international competition in domestic and foreign markets, adopt the latest foreign methods for manufacturing, and manufacturers with patent rights may request a reduction or exemption of export tax, raw material tax, transportation fees of state-owned transportation enterprises, and give awards and exclusive manufacturing rights in a certain area for five years. The latter stipulates that special industries manufacturing prime movers, motors, machine tools, metal materials, liquid fuels, and transportation equipment may request an interest guarantee - 5% for paid-in capital and 6% for bonds, limited to seven years, or subsidies - giving cash based on the annual production cost and market price of each product category.</p>
<p>In short, the construction of wartime agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce is presided over by the Ministries of Economics and Finance, promoted by the three committees, and assisted by the affiliated agencies. However, because this construction was launched in "Victory in the War of Resistance and Success in National Construction," the information is confidential and lacking, so it cannot be elaborated in detail, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Pigs and Cattle Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fresh pigs and butchered cattle are in great demand in this city. Since the National Army moved west, transportation has been frequently disrupted, making it extremely difficult. As a result, prices have increased.

(1) Over 500 pigs arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday morning and were transported in large trucks to various slaughterhouses in the British and French concessions.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Arbitrage and Capital Flight</h3>
<p>— Ying Yongsheng</p>
<p>I. What is Foreign Exchange Arbitrage?</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange market has both spot and forward rates. Due to market conditions, there are differences between spot and forward rates. Sometimes the spot rate is higher than the forward rate, and sometimes the spot rate is lower than the forward rate. Recently, the market has mostly seen spot rates cheaper than forward rates, that is, the price for this month is lower than the price for the next month. If you buy futures for this month and sell futures for the next month at the same time, there will be a difference. This difference is interest; the level of interest depends on the size of the difference. The method is similar to the previous arbitrage of public bonds.</p>
<p>II. Calculation Method of Arbitrage Interest Rate</p>
<p>Regarding the method of calculating arbitrage interest rates, there are two types of calculations: ordinary calculations and simplified calculations. They are described separately below:</p>
<p>Method for calculating the interest rate of English gold arbitrage:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary calculation: For example, on the morning of December 24, the opening price of the black market for foreign exchange was 8 pence 59375 for English gold in December, and 8 pence 5625 for January of the 28th year. If you want to invest 10,000 pounds, what is the monthly interest rate?</p>
<p>National currency to be paid in December</p>
<p>That is, a monthly interest rate of 3...</p>
<p>The ordinary calculation and the simplified calculation are originally the same. The interest rate obtained is the same for large numbers. The trailing numbers are slightly different due to the rounding of English gold into national currency.</p>
<p>Method for calculating the interest rate of US dollar arbitrage:</p>
<p>For example, on June 23, 27th year, the black market price for foreign exchange in June was 18 yuan,</p>
<p>The price in July was 17 and a half yuan. What is the monthly interest rate?</p>
<p>(Based on 100,000 US dollars)</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary calculation:</p>
<p>National currency to be paid in June</p>
<p>The difference is 15,873.02, which is the interest for one month for 555,555.55. To find out what the monthly interest rate is,</p>
<p>15,873.02×1,000 (monthly interest rate) + 555,555.55=28.5714362</p>
<p>That is, a monthly interest rate of 2% and 8 mills</p>
<p>(2) Simplified calculation:</p>
<p>The difference between the market prices in June and July is .50, and the market price in July is 17.5. The calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>.50+17.5×1,00=28.57142857</p>
<p>That is, a monthly interest rate of 2% and 8 mills</p>
<p>The interest rates obtained by the above two methods are the same for large numbers. The trailing numbers are slightly different due to the rounding of US dollars into national currency.</p>
<p>Note: The interest rates obtained above do not deduct the broker's commission. According to bank practice, 1/32% of the national currency income of the foreign exchange sold needs to be paid, and no commission is paid for the foreign exchange purchased.</p>
<p>III. Comparison of the Highs and Lows of US Dollar Arbitrage Interest Rates in the Last Half Year</p>
<p>In order to compare the highs and lows of Shanghai's arbitrage interest rates in the past six months, a comparison of the daily interest rates in the most recent six months (because the arbitrage interest rate varies from day to day in each month due to the size of the difference) is listed below to observe the general trend.</p>
<p>IV. The Relationship between High and Low Interest Rates and Capital Flight</p>
<p>Capital flight mostly involves Chinese people depositing funds into foreign banks or buying foreign exchange, but the level of arbitrage interest rates also has a significant impact on capital flight. Because thick arbitrage profits attract Chinese people to engage in foreign exchange arbitrage transactions. Moreover, ordinary people who do not understand what arbitrage is are also joining in one after another, influenced by newspaper advertisements touting the favorable arbitrage interest rates. For example, in October, because the arbitrage interest rate could reach about 2% per month, those who engaged in arbitrage transactions were particularly active. According to reports from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, more than 10 million yuan flowed directly and indirectly into foreign banks in one month of October. However, in the past two months, because the interest rate offered by arbitrage has been declining day by day, Chinese people are unwilling to continue this type of transaction and are withdrawing funds to deposit in Chinese banks to earn interest, amounting to a considerable amount, estimated at several million yuan. It can be said that a portion of the escaped capital has been recovered. It is found that the initiators of foreign exchange arbitrage are mostly foreign banks. They determine the size of the difference based on their position and mostly state on the order that the foreign exchange must be deposited in the bank without interest. Therefore, foreign exchange arbitrage can be said to be a credit loan that foreign banks absorb from Chinese people. According to the current market situation, if the interest rate offered by arbitrage is high, there will inevitably be more capital flight; if the interest rate is low, the capital that has already escaped will naturally be recovered. Regarding capital flight, it has a significant impact on the market, and the rise and fall of the black market interest rates for discounts are also related. In short, foreign exchange arbitrage and capital flight are very closely related.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: English Banks Refuse to Accept Gold Mortgages; English Gold Price Falls More Sharply; Spot Gold Trading in This City Was Non-Existent Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market at the start of trading was because it was a regular Sunday holiday, although there were still some members gathered, but there was no trading. The number of customers entering and exiting the cash exchange industry was also very few. The selling price was still around 1,990 yuan. Also, the price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops has not changed. Datong Bank still hangs the original price of 202 yuan, Xin Bank hangs 200 yuan, and buys in at 194 yuan. Also, a London telegram on the 7th reported that due to sudden rumors in the market that banks would refuse to accept gold mortgages in the future, and the pound sterling has been lengthening daily after being protected by the Ministry of Finance, this has caused panic among those who hold physical goods, and they have successively come out in large numbers, causing the decline to increase tenfold. The price has shrunk sharply by eight and a half pence per ounce, retreating to seven pounds, eight shillings, and nine and a half pence.</p>
<h3>English and Indian Silver Prices Both Shrink</h3>
<p>A London telegram on the 7th reported that speculators were selling, there was a lack of support, and the market situation was calm. Both near-term and far-term large bars of silver shrunk by one-eighth seven-five. A New York silver telegram reported that the price of American silver was still quoted but untraded. Also, a Bombay silver telegram reported that Indian silver was still loose and tired. The spot price and near-term and far-term prices continued to shrink by two annas.</p>
<h3>Grain: Both Thick and Thin Indica Rice Had No Ups or Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday's source of national rice, the downriver area, arrived on the 7th, and more than 10,000 bags were transported from Suzhou, so people's hearts were more discouraged. Both the market on this street and the storage households felt that the sales were inferior, and the sales of steamed buns were also not as smooth as before, making it difficult for the market to see any more strength. The price of both thick and thin indica rice remained at the original price and had no ups or downs. Du Yangbu tip was also similar. The shortage of biànyuán goods was still in good shape, but because the price level was already high, it was difficult to increase it, and it was the same as the current flat situation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Quanzhou Telegram, Authentic Goods; Quanzhou Sugar Entering Shanghai Prevented</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, such as crude white, car white, lotus red, and domestic Chao sugar, etc., did not have many transactions and the opening was also scarce, with no significant ups and downs. There was a shipment of 599 bags of Quanzhou sugar transported by the Shenguang Wheel. According to the Fangxi news from the Jianbang firm, a telegram from Quanzhou reported that goods were being stopped because Huian, which is adjacent to that place, was shelled by enemy ships, so there was a fear of accidents. If the other party really has intentions, then the source of sugar will have problems, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Southern Gorgon Fruit Creates a New High Price</h3>
<p>Southern Tang gorgon fruit: Because this season had a poor harvest, the inventory in the production area was already scarce. The unified goods price had previously risen from more than 100 yuan to 145 yuan. Now, because the Shanghai market felt thin day by day, the trend was tight, and the price increased by another 15 yuan. Yesterday's market sold for 160 yuan. According to people in the industry, there is a risk of a shortage of goods soon. It has been found that the top sieve surface has already been sold out, and even ordinary pond gorgon fruit is priced at 60 yuan. However, medicinal gorgon fruit, that is, cut gorgon fruit, is cheaper, selling for 27-28 yuan. The market is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Torreya Seed Supply is Not Continued</h3>
<p>Torreya seeds are produced in the inland areas of Zhejiang. There were previously stocks held by traders here, selling for 20 to 22 yuan per picul. Most of the purchases were made by Nanjing and Zhenjiang firms. As of now, they have been sold out, and the supply has suddenly been interrupted. However, the demand is still high. If there are arrivals, it is generally speculated that the price will have to rise to 40 to 50 yuan, which shows the eagerness.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Last Month's New York Raw Silk Consumption Decreased and Inventory Increased</h3>
<p>New York's raw silk statistics for December of last year:</p>
<p>It has now been disclosed by the New York Raw Silk Association. Viewing the various statistical figures as a whole seems to imply that the recent rise in raw silk may turn sluggish. The total import volume of New York raw silk last month was 42,264 piculs, a decrease of 1,742 piculs compared to the previous month. The total consumption was 25,204 piculs, a decrease of 6,395 piculs compared to the previous month. The total inventory was 53,278 piculs, an increase of 7,060 piculs compared to the previous month. The details are listed below (unit: piculs):</p>

<h3>TALK - WRITTEN FOR SHANGHAI WOMEN</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Respected Shanghai Women Compatriots,</p>
<p>You live in Shanghai, and although your actions are not entirely free, you have already achieved considerable success in social service.</p>
<p>In the past eighteen months, you have educated refugees in refugee shelters; you have held relief fairs to raise funds for refugees; you have collected donations for refugees on the streets; you have donated your own clothes to refugees. Recently, you have enthusiastically supported the promotion of frugal relief. Indeed, you have fulfilled your responsibility as a citizen.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to say to you is not to praise your past achievements, but to hope that you will go further in seeking happiness for the people. I believe you can fully achieve the following points:</p>
<p>1.  Practice Frugality in Clothing and Food: Recently, a Ms. Wang Guoxiu returned from the United States. According to her, women in several major cities in the United States have switched to wearing cotton socks. Women in several other cities have participated in the "One Bowl of Rice" movement, which has been very successful. Originally, American women wore silk stockings, and American society is very affluent. Why do they wear cotton socks? Why do they only eat one bowl of rice, going hungry? They are truly sympathetic to the suffering people of the world. In particular, the virtue of frugality in clothing and food is even more worthy of our emulation and practice. I hope that the women compatriots of Shanghai can achieve this.</p>
<p>2.  Organize Reading Groups: It is a very meaningful activity to organize a reading group with several neighbors, classmates, or relatives. Each person buys several newly published books, newspapers, and magazines, puts them together, and borrows them in turn. During meetings, they can present reports to each other and discuss various issues related to reading, such as education, social issues, and current events. I believe that modern women should have this interest in reading. Reading groups are the most honorable group activity for women. I hope you will quickly organize them.</p>
<p>3.  Organize Hiking Clubs: Shanghai women compatriots often do not pay attention to their physical health, and they rarely organize hiking clubs. Women's hiking clubs have been popular in Europe and America for a long time, so their bodies are much stronger than yours. This kind of organization is very simple. You only need to decide on a few people and stipulate the method of each hike, such as running or cycling, and then you can hold it. The route of the hike may be temporarily limited to quiet roads. This is an easy and feasible fitness activity. I hope that in the near future, there will be such groups in the Shanghai women's community.</p>
<p>4.  Do Not Engage in Meaningless Pastimes: I have heard that a very small number of women in Shanghai like to play cards. Why do they like to play cards? I can't figure out the reason. This kind of meaningless pastime wastes time and energy, and it neglects family affairs, so it really needs to be improved. Think about it, if you sit at the card table all day long, leaving household affairs to the servants and letting the children play in the alleys, this kind of life without family responsibility, if it continues for a long time, will inevitably lead to family breakdown. The family is the basic unit of the country. If the family breaks down, how can a healthy country be produced! I hope you will pay special attention to banning and prohibiting it!</p>
<p>In addition, such as happily using domestic products, implementing family savings, etc., I think you have already done it, so I won't say more.</p>
<h3>NEW YEAR RELIEF OPENING CHAPTER</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Time flies, another year passes, today we see a new scene again. New Year is celebrated with much excitement on this lonely island, a joyful occasion for delightful events. Some are: elegantly gathering around the fireplace for warm drinks, some are: reverting to bad habits and indulging in gambling. Shouting and wagering are still not enough, so they go to the red-light district to seek pleasure. Everywhere, clear songs gently turn, and graceful dance shadows gracefully sway. How much pursuit of pleasure and joy do they know? Can they think of the suffering and displaced refugees! They are: shivering frequently due to lack of warm clothes, and also: suffering from hunger with little soup or broth to swallow. It is truly pitiful to be without clothes or food, longing for their hometowns while secretly shedding tears. Everyone has a home but cannot return, hating the brutal soldiers with unbearable anger! Most pitiful are: the fragile bodies of refugee children, how can they endure the cruel suffering, as if: tender buds are being battered by wind and rain. The same compatriots share different joys and sorrows, other countries still express their sympathy. Everyone should have a compassionate heart, and only when one is satiated and not drowning can one be called benevolent. I urge you to quickly untie the bag of benevolence, and enthusiastically donate without tiring. Let us come together to help those in need without hesitation.</p>
<h3>REFUGEES AND THE PUBLIC</h3>
<p>— Refugee Reporter</p>
<p>In this era of suffering, everyone is a refugee:</p>
<p>Some are refugees with clothes and food, some are refugees without clothes and food. We hope: that the refugees with clothes and food will save some and help the refugees without clothes and food! We also hope: that the refugees without clothes and food will work hard and unite to become refugees with food!</p>
<p>Those who manage refugee shelters should strive to ensure that there are no refugees to manage.</p>
<p>Those who work in refugee relief should strive to ensure that there are no refugees in need of relief. Our goal is to train and nurture the refugees without clothes and food, making them useful and capable members of the public!</p>
<p>That's why our weekly is called "The Public Weekly."</p>
<h3>PILGRIMAGE TO SELF-SUFFICIENCY REFUGEE CAMPS (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>(III) The Third Self-Sufficiency Camp, located at the intersection of Avenue Road and Gordon Road, has now been disbanded.</p>
<p>(IV) The Fourth Self-Sufficiency Camp: Originally known as the Jiaozhou Refugee Camp, it is located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road. The organization of this camp is divided into three sections: General Affairs, Guidance, and Management. The General Affairs section is divided into: 1. Documentation, 2. Provisions, 3. Storage, 4. Accounting. The Guidance section is divided into: 1. Registration, 2. Hygiene, 3. Security. The Management section is divided into: 1. Class Instruction, 2. Statistics. There are a total of 244 self-sufficient refugees in this camp, with employed and unemployed each accounting for half. In addition to the staff and educated children who are provided with meals by the camp, the remaining refugees purchase meals from the camp at 100 cash per liter, with no limit on the amount purchased. Adults pay five cents per month for water and electricity, and the remaining expenses are borne by the Charity Federation. The refugees' production work is all done outside the camp.</p>
<p>(V) The Fifth Self-Sufficiency Camp is located inside the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road and Zhanlang Road. The camp's affairs are handled by the director, deputy director, accountant, education officer, and instructors, etc., who handle daily affairs. The managers manage registration, production, writing, general affairs, provisions, storage, hygiene, and medical services. The refugees are all those who were previously able to be self-sufficient in the Cisheng Refugee Camp. A total of 447 elderly and young refugees, as well as staff members of the camp, are provided with meals by the camp. 184 people buy their own meals, costing 200 cash per day. Some production work is done inside the camp, and some is done outside the camp. Some clothing is provided by the refugees themselves, and some is provided by the camp. Education is divided into children's classes, women's classes, and men's classes. The children's class is divided into six levels, with more than 100 students, who receive full-day instruction. The Dunxin Road Refugee Camp began construction in October last year and has been completed, covering an area of more than 40 acres, with beds, classrooms, and medical facilities (photographed by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association). The women's class has more than 30 students, and the adult class has about 60 students, who attend classes for one hour each day.</p>
<p>(VI) The 18th Christian Self-Sufficiency Camp: The organization is divided into six groups: Religion, General Affairs, Medical Services, Education, Catering, and Registration. Most of the refugees are reorganized from the previous 18 camps, and some have moved in from other places, but they must be guaranteed by a pastor. The total number of people is 300 to 400. The monthly meal fee is four yuan, half price for ages five to twelve, and free for ages under five. The rent for a south-facing room is four and a half yuan, and the rent for a north-facing room is four yuan, with a maximum of eight people allowed to live in each room. Each electric light costs eight yuan. Children's education includes six levels of primary school, divided into four classes, with a kindergarten attached, and independent classrooms. There is no adult education class yet. Refugees can enter and leave freely except during class time. There is also a portion of elderly and frail people who are unable to produce and are still provided with supplies by the camp.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a former 36th branch of the Charity Federation, which has now been converted into a work dormitory. It is newly established, and the internal organization is simple. There are more than ten refugees. Each refugee pays four and a half yuan for meal money each month. The camp cooks and distributes the meals, twice a day, at 11 am and 5 pm. There are no other restrictions. Some work outside the camp, and some work inside the camp. Refugees have absolute freedom of entry and exit, and it is entirely a dormitory. The camp only accepts female workers, so it is also called the Female Workers' Dormitory.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the self-sufficiency camps, it has reduced a part of the public consumption and increased production. On the part of the refugees themselves, they can produce and at the same time exercise their bodies. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>Looking at the self-sufficiency situation of the various camps, the impression is very good. This is also a great achievement in refugee relief. Living a life of dependency is gradually advancing to a life of self-reliance. In the near future, the number of refugees who can be self-sufficient will definitely increase gradually, which is worth waiting for.</p>
<h3>NATIONAL HERO - STONE BOY</h3>
<p>— Jin Yixi</p>
<p>During the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were often bullied by others. That year, just like now, there were invading troops, who burned, looted, raped, and killed, doing everything without restraint. Fortunately, with the efforts of local government troops and militia, the situation was stabilized. A small city in the northwest of Shanghai (north of Nanxiang, west of Luodian), called Jiading, was also spared this harassment.</p>
<p>It was a quiet evening, the night enveloped the earth, dark clouds obscured the moon, a cool breeze passed through the sparse forest, blowing gently, startled birds roosting, chirping like the sound of ghosts crying. Ancient trees stretched out their withered branches across the road, like iron hands reaching out to grab people, a kind of secluded and dark atmosphere, making people's hair stand on end. The patrolling soldiers in the shadows were on guard, and the fierce enemy soldiers were finally unable to succeed and were frustrated.</p>
<p>However, people's energy is ultimately limited. After each soldier and militiaman had defended for several days and nights, they were all exhausted, and the sleep demon grabbed everyone's eyelids, and they all fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>At this time, the enemy soldiers, who had been anxiously besieging the city without success, caught a glimpse of the sparse black shadows on the city wall and thought that the time to attack the city had come. Ladders and ropes were brought, and they carried their weapons, braving the black sky, and tiptoed towards the breaches in the city wall.</p>
<p>In this extremely critical moment, a boy heard a strange "rustling" sound and looked in that direction.</p>
<p>"Ah!" If he hadn't looked, it would have been better, but the sight stirred his heart with surging hot blood. Looking back at his companions, they were all snoring loudly. He gritted his teeth, silently grasped his broadsword tightly, and lay伏 in ambush by the breach, waiting for the arrival of the enemy soldiers, to give them a heavy lesson.</p>
<p>The enemy soldiers, one by one, ascended as fast as lightning. Just as they were about to look around to see what was happening, unexpectedly, a bright broadsword stretched out from the side, with a "crash," their heads and bodies parted ways. One, two, three... With the sound of "crash," they parted ways one by one and rolled down. It was as satisfying as cutting vegetables.</p>
<p>"Hua!" A chorus of voices woke up, woke up the sleepy-eyed officers and soldiers and militia, in a group of noisy sounds.</p>
<p>"Kill! The enemy is coming!" The boy shouted at the top of his lungs in the tense air.</p>
<p>"Kill! The enemy is coming! Compatriots, get up quickly!" The officers, soldiers, and militia all responded.</p>
<p>In a flurry of flashing swords, countless heads were cut off. Suddenly, with a "bang," a cannonball came from a distance, and the boy fell in response. It was a pity that he sacrificed himself with a smile on his face for the sake of the country and the locality.</p>
<p>However, although the child was killed, the enemy was finally defeated in the collaborative counterattack and retreated far away. Thus, the lives and property of the entire city of Jiading were protected.</p>
<p>This short story is full of hot blood, it is tragic! Now, at the two city gates in the northeast of Jiading, there are stone statues of the boy, which commemorate his great deeds and allow people to admire this tragic situation forever.</p>
<h3>LIFE SKETCHES - TEACHING MY MOTHER TO READ - SECOND NEWSBOY SCHOOL</h3>
<p>— Li Xiyi</p>
<p>December 8th</p>
<p>Today, I got up, washed my face, and brushed my teeth, then went to the newspaper office to unpack some newspapers. My mother went to the market to sell fish. After I finished delivering the newspapers, I went to the market to help my mother sell fish. After my mother and I finished selling the fish, we went home to cook. After lunch, I taught my mother to read. After teaching her for more than half a month, my mother could recognize some of the words on the banknotes. While I was teaching my mother, I was also reading and writing myself. At four o'clock, I took the money and went to the news agency to unpack some evening newspapers. After selling them, I went to school to study.</p>
<h3>WAR REPORT - WEEKLY UPDATE</h3>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>On the Guangdong front, since the Chinese army launched a fierce counteroffensive, the Japanese army has shortened the battle lines, reorganized, and waited for reinforcements. They have also actively built fortifications in the areas surrounding Guangzhou, such as Zengcheng, Huangpu, Shunde, Jiujiang, Foshan, and Sanshui, as a plan for retreating and attacking. Recently, the Japanese troops in Zengcheng and Shangxia Luogang have been attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, causing panic and firing cannons at night, consuming a lot of ammunition. The Japanese troops in Shilong were attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army on the night of the 28th, and fought with the Japanese army in the streets for several hours, causing considerable losses to the Japanese army. At dawn, the Chinese army safely retreated to its original position. A unit of the Japanese army in Foshan of a thousand men was transferred to Guanyao, and a regiment transferred back from Jiujiang filled the gap, seemingly in a rotation adjustment. The Japanese First Division in Sanshui is also actively preparing, and it is said that there are still subsequent troops being transported, indicating that they have active intentions toward the West River. The Japanese warships on the Beihai and Qiongya sea areas have not been seen to have any activity.</p>
<p>Yuehan</p>
<p>The war on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has been quite quiet recently. The two armies are still facing each other on the line of the Xinqiang River and Jiuling Street. A certain unit of the Chinese army recently attacked Taolin, Linxiang, at night. The Japanese army was caught off guard and retreated northward.</p>
<p>Nanxun</p>
<p>On the Nanxun front, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still facing each other on both sides of the Xiu River. Except for occasional small contacts between guerrillas and the Japanese army, there has been no fierce war on the front. At dawn on New Year's Day, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops at various key points between Yongxiu and Dean. It has been quite effective, and the Chinese army is currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>Eyu</p>
<p>On the northern Hubei front, after the Japanese troops in Yingshan, Taolin, Heguan, and Hepu were attacked by the Chinese army, most of them retreated to Xihe. The Japanese troops in Guandimiao also retreated to Yingshan. After the Japanese troops in Anlu were attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army and captured Qinglongtan, the Japanese army retreated backward. The Japanese troops in Zaoshi are heavily guarded, seemingly without the will to attack. There has been no war recently on the southern Henan front. However, the Japanese troops in eastern Henan are very active. The Japanese troops in Shangqiu and Kaifeng have recently increased to five or six thousand, and a portion of them has invaded Qixian and is currently engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese troops defending the city. Although Tongxu has been occupied by the Japanese army, due to the restraining effect of the Chinese guerrillas, they have not dared to invade westward for the time being. On the northern Henan front, the Japanese headquarters in Xinxiang was attacked by Chinese plainclothes soldiers, causing a fire that burned for a whole day. The station north of Xinxiang was also occupied by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army is now retreating northward.</p>
<p>JinSui</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Shanxi is attempting to actively encircle and attack the Chinese army in western Shanxi, as a preparation for invading west of the Yellow River. They once began to invade a few days ago. The Japanese troops invading northward from Hejin were severely attacked by the Chinese army near Yumenshan and have retreated towards the Hechu area. Another group of Japanese troops invading westward from Linfen, together with the Japanese troops moving south from Fenyang, retreated to Daning on the 29th and sent a portion of their troops to harass Jixian and Xiangning. The Chinese army is currently engaging them. In addition, there are Japanese troops invading south from Fenyang across Jiuyu, who have also encountered a counterattack by the Chinese army, so it is unlikely that they will succeed. The Japanese troops invading westward from Lishi are currently maneuvering with the Chinese army near Liulin. The Chinese army is currently driving them away in separate routes. In short, Jixian and Xiangning are the pre-determined battlefields of the Chinese army, and there have been thorough arrangements. It is expected that the Japanese troops in that area will suffer a major blow soon. The Japanese troops in the vicinity of Suiyuan and Baotou have continued to increase, seemingly with the intention of invading westward. Fearing attacks by Chinese guerrillas, they have recently demolished all the civilian houses within thirty li of Baotou, and the refugees who have no home to return to have joined the guerrillas in droves. In this way, the Japanese army will be greatly threatened. At the same time, the puppet troops in the area are fighting among themselves, and the more powerful units are rumored to be brewing defection.</p>
<p>Hebei</p>
<p>There are many Japanese troops stationed at various key points on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. There are more than 10,000 Japanese troops in the vicinity of Shijiazhuang, and more than 7,000 of them have gradually moved westward, seemingly with the intention of reinforcing Shanxi.</p>
<p>In short, summarizing this week's war situation, there have been no particularly large battles on any front. On the southern China front, the Japanese army in Guangdong seems to be holding firmly to the key points near Guangdong, as well as the strongholds of Humen, Dongguan, etc., with the main force invading Zhaoqing from Sanshui. However, after the Chinese army launched simultaneous attacks on various fronts, the Japanese army has already shown a situation where it cannot attend to both ends. It has suffered heavy losses in recent days and can only retreat and become困 in its original position. On the central China fronts, there have been small contacts愿 between the two sides. The Japanese army seems to be concentrating in Wuhan to reorganize, while the Chinese army is also waiting for an opportunity to encircle and attack. On the northern China front, the Japanese troops in Shanxi and Chahar are eager to make trouble. They have invaded various places in western Shanxi in separate routes, but after being severely attacked by the Chinese army, they have suffered heavy losses and are still in confrontation in the areas of Hejin, Jixian, and Lishi. The Chinese army has strict defenses and strong troops, and it is not easy for the Japanese army to break through and invade west of the river. At the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, it is actually beneficial for the Chinese army that the Japanese army is flowing into the mountains. In all aspects of strategy and tactics, the Japanese army has already shown exhaustion and resourcefulness, and is stretched thin. If the Chinese army currently utilizes new strategies and tactics to implement a full-scale war, the Japanese army will be even more exhausted. The victory of the future is in expectation.</p>

<h3>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION EMPHASIZES FILM EDUCATION - Stipulations for Subsidizing Radio and Dry Battery Methods in Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) In view of the importance of film education, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated the methods for subsidizing the price of radios and dry batteries in various provinces in the second half of the 27th year, which are announced and implemented as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At present, transportation is inconvenient. The Ministry will subsidize radios and dry batteries in various provinces in the second half of this year. Except for the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang, which will be allocated radios according to regulations, the remaining provinces will uniformly verify and issue cash according to the price, which will be selected, purchased, distributed, and transported by the Education Department of each province. The Ministry will also verify and provide transportation costs according to regulations.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry's subsidy for the price of dry batteries in various provinces is limited to one set per radio installed by the Ministry. If educational institutions that install their own radios are unable to afford dry battery consumers due to special circumstances, they may also submit a request to the Education Department for verification and transfer to the Ministry for appropriate subsidies.</p>
<p>(3) The Education Department of each province should submit a request for the price of radios and dry batteries in accordance with the quantity stipulated by the Ministry in the second half of this year, limited to one request. If the request is not made by the end of January of the 28th year, the price will be distributed separately and will not be reissued.</p>
<p>(4) The Education Department of each province should plan in advance, list them separately, and submit them to the Ministry for the price of radios and dry batteries. The Ministry will quickly review and reply (the radio form should list the name of the institution, location, type of machine installed, machine price, transportation, and tax fees, etc. The dry battery form should list the name of the institution, location, type and quantity of dry batteries, price, transportation, and tax fees, etc.).</p>
<p>(5) After receiving the notice of approval from the Ministry, the Education Department of each province should immediately order goods from manufacturers, distribute them, and obtain a copy of the invoice and transportation fee receipt, together with the printed receipt from the department, to submit to the Ministry for verification and issuance of the price.</p>
<p>(6) In areas closer to the central radio stations directly under the central government or the provincial radio stations in each province, radios with fewer vacuum tubes should be issued as appropriate (two or three lamps are sufficient). In towns with AC power sources, DC radios should not be issued, so as to save material resources.</p>
<p>(7) When purchasing and distributing radios and dry batteries, domestic products should be purchased as much as possible, and priority should be given to purchasing from the Changsha Central Wireless Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Plant.</p>

Tung Wah, in a seemingly hopeless situation, made a comeback, scoring two consecutive goals in the last three minutes to win 6-5. The team’s good fortune was praised by fans. In the first half, Tung Wah took the lead three times, but the score ended in a 3-3 tie. In the second half, St. Francis de Sales took the lead at 4-3 and then 5-4, creating a seesaw battle. Unexpectedly, Tung Wah's victory came out of nowhere. Xu Chengxun and Wan Xianghua scored consecutive goals, sealing the victory and leaving St. Francis de Sales in a state of bewilderment over their loss.</p>

<p>Tung Wah attacked first with great momentum, and St. Francis de Sales had little resistance. Wu Binghao and Jia Youliang made two crosses each, but Wan Xianghua missed the opportunities, which was a pity. After seven minutes, Xianghua picked the ball, and A Dai made a feint. Shen Shiyan headed the ball from five yards out, bouncing it off Capeboute's shoulder and into the net. Tung Wah took the lead. Several consecutive attacks put St. Francis de Sales in danger. After fifteen minutes, St. Francis de Sales' Leikofski went deep, and Zhang Zhaopeng missed a foot. Kairole Qu shot from 25 yards out. Zhou Dayun rushed out of the goal but failed to catch the ball, which slipped into the net, tying the score at 1-1. After that, Tung Wah's attack was effective. Five minutes later, Tung Wah's good fortune came. Wu Binghao cut in from the side, and Dai Linjing and Shen Shiyan rushed up together. Shen Shiyan forcefully collided with Capeboute, and both the player and the ball went into the net. Tung Wah took the lead again at 2-1. Five minutes later, Rendaye shot, and Dayun was out of position. Zhaoxiang retreated and kicked the ball out. Xu Chengxun accidentally fouled and was awarded a penalty kick. Fu En scored, tying the score at 2-2. After thirty-four minutes, Dai Linjing's shot was blocked. Wu Binghao's low shot was caught by Capeboute but lost again, flowing into the net.

<p>Two Goals in a Sudden Comeback</p>
<p>After switching sides, both Tung Wah and St. Francis de Sales had chances. Zhang Zhaopeng was injured and left the field but returned shortly after. After fifteen minutes, Pantuo Xun was awarded a free kick because Jiang Zhaoxiang fouled. Kairole Qu headed the ball into the right corner. Dayun was unable to save it. St. Francis de Sales took the lead for the first time at 4-3. But just one minute later, Tung Wah launched an attack from the center line, and A Dai made a low shot near the goal, immediately tying the score at 4-4. After an hour of mutual attacks, Fu En crossed, and Zhaoxiang intercepted. Endaye intercepted, just a short distance away, and flicked it into the bottom corner, taking the lead again. Tung Wah, seeing the seriousness of the situation, launched an all-out attack. St. Francis de Sales tried their best to defend. As the last three minutes approached, Tung Wah had still not made any progress. The audience stood up. Unexpectedly, Xu Chengxun suddenly displayed his skills, scoring a goal out of nowhere, tying the score at 5-5. With an unexpected goal, the attack became even stronger. In the last minute, A Dai hooked the ball, Jia shoveled and passed to A Wan, and Wan Xianghua made a low shot, immediately touching the net, making it 6-5. Tung Wah immediately turned defeat into victory. Although Xianghua left the field due to injury, it was no longer critical. The whistle blew loudly. Tung Wah defeated St. Francis de Sales 6-5. The fans congratulated each other, saying, "What a swift path!"</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>"Face" and Changing Faces</h3>
<p>— Du Qin</p>
<p>Upper-class Chinese people like to talk about "face". Because they like to talk about "face", they often have to change their faces. — This sounds strange, but it is indeed the case.</p>
<p>We Chinese naturally know what "face" is. However, some foreigners who study China say that "face" is like the "rites" of ancient China, and it is difficult to find an equivalent word to translate it. It is indeed very difficult to explain the term "face" clearly. However, in general, "saving face" is nothing more than not exposing something embarrassing that has been done. — This is certainly not the essence of "face", but I really can't think of a clearer way to say it for a moment, so I'll just count it for now. In fact, the aspects that face-ism plays out are extremely broad.</p>
<p>There is a story passed down from the late Qing Dynasty. A minor official harbored a grudge against a senior official. He deliberately ran up to him when the senior official was seeing off guests and whispered, as if reporting a confidential matter: "Would it be okay to give your mother to this humble official as a wife?" The people nearby could not hear what was said, so the senior official replied loudly; "Yes, yes. Do it tomorrow, do it tomorrow." This was because it did not hurt his "face", that is, it was not exposed, so he dealt with it in this way. However, the officials of the late Qing Dynasty also had a way: when he was talking to a subordinate, if that person accidentally exposed some of his secrets, that is, hurt his "face" a little, he would give you a cold shoulder, suddenly sinking his face, as if he didn't recognize you at all, saying: "I forgot your esteemed name ——" The meaning is to give the other party a "face" slap as well. This is a concrete manifestation of changing faces for the sake of face.</p>
<p>But no matter what, the so-called "face" is really like the "rites" of the past, just a trick of the upper classes. In fact, the lower classes do not have this kind of thinking. If you don't believe it, try to inquire from the mouths of the lower classes, they never say the word "face". Of course, they often scold people for being "shameless", but that meaning is much simpler. It is quite different from "saving face".</p>
<p>Because of this, the lower classes are not as likely to change their faces as the upper classes. Yesterday you said he was my partner, today you say he is my enemy, and tomorrow you slap yourself in the face, saying that I was originally his godson. Yesterday I said I was an iron man, today I say I am "serving the public despite illness", but tomorrow I frown and say that I have an "illness" and cannot "serve the public"... How can the lower classes play these tricks?</p>
<p>Although we sometimes see in the literature that the lower classes seem to be changing their faces, in reality, they are mostly "masks" painted for them by the upper classes. For example, the Boxers, if we were to recognize their faces in the "Donghua Sequel", they would first be "Boxer bandits", but later they would become "righteous people", and finally they would become "Boxer bandits" again. However, as long as those who truly understand history know that the real face-changer was the current dynasty that was saving its own face, while the Boxers were always just the Boxers. Zai Fu, one of the protagonists at the time, was a bandit by birth. After his face was painted with a "mask", he was very surprised and even wrote a letter to Ronglu to ask him what was going on. To criticize him in Shanghai dialect, it would be called "not knowing his place".</p>
<p>The sages of China are clever. They called the upper classes "gentlemen" and the lower classes "petty people". In this way, the upper classes are always good people, and the lower classes are always bad guys. "The virtue of the gentleman is wind, the virtue of the petty man is grass." The upper classes are elusive, making it difficult for people to figure them out, but you only see the lower classes falling east and west.</p>
<p>Because the lower classes don't "save face" and don't have knowledge, they allow the upper classes to sometimes elevate them to patriots and sometimes demote them to "bandits". As for the upper classes, of course, they are always "gentlemen" until death. Here is another irrelevant example.</p>
<p>It is said that when Shanghai had just fallen, some Jiangbei people guarded the traffic entrances of the concessions and the southern city, and pointed to the badges on their chests and said frankly: "We are traitors, understand?" This is certainly the truth. But only the traitors of the lower classes would be so honest. If the traitors of the upper classes would not be so stupid. Not only would they never admit that they were traitors, but they would also scold the traitors in front of you.</p>
<h3>Old Liu</h3>
<p>— He Longsheng</p>
<p>Rain like cow's hair, wind with a chilling sound. The sky was somewhat displeasingly gray, and the shadow of brightness seemed hidden in one place.</p>
<p>Such weather truly spoils the scenery, dampening people's desire to travel. "How annoying..." Old Wang, wearing a sharp suit and holding a pipe, walked to the window, complaining to the sky.</p>
<p>"There are many annoying things, young masters only know how to play." Old Chen, wearing thick glasses of eight hundred degrees, was staring intently at the Outline of Chinese Literature History when he was provoked by Old Wang's words, and said impatiently.</p>
<p>"...What does a fool know?... Eat, drink, and be merry... If you were like this, you wouldn't have any worries in your life!... Life is like a mayfly, never secure, do you remember Old Liu's hand?... "</p>
<p>"People without thoughts are simply equivalent to pigs!"</p>
<p>Old Wang and Old Chen argued as if they were about to fight.</p>
<p>Mentioning Old Liu, excitement and sadness surged into my heart!</p>
<p>...On the rugged road, our ambulance drove forward... We spotted enemy planes tracking us, we immediately stopped the car... and hid in the fields... bullets fell like hail... the world is so big, where can we be safe... we are all going to die!... "Haha!" Old Liu told us triumphantly when he returned.</p>
<p>"Bullets have no eyes, be careful!" But he never took it to heart. Day followed dusk, and dusk followed day, and it had been a long time since we had seen him return. We were suspicious and fearful. Later, the truth told us: he was injured--when his car set off and was halfway, suddenly, red and green signals appeared in the sky. Although he knew things were bad, the quick-witted him didn't have time to escape. Mother-son bombs shot straight over as if they had eyes, and fresh blood stained his snow-white clothes. Ah! They, they, three people were harmed--he lost his left arm, one lost a leg, and another was fatally wounded and died on the way.</p>
<p>Lying on the snow-white sickbed was he, missing an arm, without a trace of worry, calm and dignified, as if praying for something.</p>
<p>"...What does it matter--you don't have to worry, I can be discharged in a few days..." He said, "It's also interesting to say, I was originally a rescuer, and now people are rescuing me."</p>
<p>"Humans are inherently interdependent and coexist... loving others is loving oneself, harming others is harming oneself..." I interjected.</p>
<p>A smile appeared on his face, as if he had gained a little comfort and became excited.</p>
<p>"Jackals will eat people, and as a result, die at the hands of hunters!..."</p>
<p>"...What does it matter to lose an arm for others! People have already lost their lives for me! Losing an arm makes me useless? No! If the left arm is broken, there is still the right arm. Old Wen lost a leg, but he still has one leg. Old Sheng's body died, but his spirit will never die!... Our blood will never run out, and the soul of the nation will never be extinguished!... Look! See how long they live! The day of 'justice' is the time when 'might' dies. We must identify our goals and move forward through thorns!... Survival obtained with blood is true survival; history written with blood is glorious history... Forward! Forward!"</p>
<p>He forgot all the pain, raised! He raised his only arm, clenched his fist and shouted, as if hot blood was boiling, like a volcano erupting, breaking through the deathly silent ward, touching the heartstrings of every patient!</p>
<p>Hey! Old Liu's words and his figure, when I think of them now, are still vivid as a picture. But now, I don't know where he has gone. Perhaps, in order to fulfill his mission, he is continuing to move towards the path of light!</p>
<p>Faintly, I heard the old ox humming from afar:</p>
<p>"Bleeding for the country, the country will not perish, resist! Resist!—"</p>
<p>Black clouds gradually disappeared, and the east revealed a faint light.</p>
<h3>In Wu Jia Xiang</h3>
<p>— Ren Yong</p>
<p>Three years ago, I left Wu Jia Xiang. But I don't miss her too much, because Jiangwan is not without its beauty, and I can find the true meaning in the realistic environment, so why should I pointlessly miss the past.</p>
<p>However, now I intensely miss the past, and in picture after picture of memories, beautiful Wu Jia Xiang rushes to float up first. I deeply remember her, sometimes in the early morning, sometimes in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Wu Jia Xiang has a living beauty! There, there are five hundred acres of land, there, there are countless young men and women. Among us, there are men as strong as iron bulls, there are maidens as brave as Mulan, our younger siblings are still infants whose milky smell has not yet dried. The older ones are wearing old student uniforms and blue cheongsams, and the younger ones are all mighty boy scouts, with thick bare legs, showing rosy faces, what is this? Isn't this a living beauty?</p>
<p>Early morning is the most lovely time. In the clear breeze of the morning, at the sound of a bugle, groups of young people swarm out of the surrounding dormitories, habitually lining up. The physical education teacher shouts on the high platform in front of the flagpole, the bugler sounds a blast, the beautiful national flag solemnly climbs to the top of the ten-zhang pole, a thousand people stand on the field, but there is not a single sound, each person is like an iron pillar, saluting the national flag with the greatest respect! Neat, solemn, isn't this a living beauty?</p>
<p>The national flag is fluttering at the top of the pole, and the magnificent morning meeting song roars loudly along with the loudspeaker: "...Caressing the wounds of the Songhu battle, quelling the injustice, a surge of hot blood rushes to the heart for thousands of zhang, when will the national prestige be promoted, the sovereignty asserted, talents emerge...bravely advance! Forward, young people of Shangzhong!..." Ah, what a thoroughly energetic morning.</p>
<p>During the day, we are all busy with our studies, Longmen Building and Xianmian Hall are the places where we exercise our brains. After four o'clock, these two Western-style buildings become quiet, and groups of us, taking off our student uniforms, rush madly to the sports field and gymnasium, where we forge our muscles and bones. Literature and martial arts, how can either be spared?</p>
<p>The setting sun is quickly slipping towards the west, the national flag, its face flushed, crawls down the ten-zhang pole, the heroic bugle sound orders every young man to stand still, still like an iron pillar, protecting our national flag, slowly crawling down.</p>
<p>In the evening, the five hundred acres of land are all quiet, the window holes of the dormitory emit light, and our partners are struggling desperately with knowledge again. Literature and martial arts, how can either be spared?</p>
<p>However, I have been separated from this kind of life for three years. That kind of living beauty constantly returns to the edge of my eyes, I squint at it, I silently recall it.</p>
<p>Recall, reverie, recall, reverie; I am shocked without realizing it! Now, I wonder what kind of flag is fluttering on the ten-zhang pole? In the three-dimensional dormitory, what has become of our desks and iron beds?</p>
<p>However, every morning, the bugle sounds seem to still roar in my ears, and the national flag seems to still flutter between my eyebrows. I can't help but sing the "Morning Meeting Song" from Wu Jia Xiang, and on the drying platform, I stand alone like an iron pillar, vigorously doing calisthenics alone. Just one drying platform is equivalent to a vast square of five hundred acres. Memories are useless, we need to work, we need to work eternally!</p>
<h3>Ode to Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Shaoguang</p>
<p>Fireworks fill the sky,</p>
<p>Illuminating our bright future,</p>
<p>The stirring bugle,</p>
<p>Awakens the dreams of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Who is not a dignified seven-foot body?</p>
<p>How can we willingly be slaughtered and trampled!</p>
<p>We want to live--but we are not afraid of death,</p>
<p>(Death, must be a death of value!)</p>
<p>To have the courage to risk life in the face of danger,</p>
<p>Only then are we worthy of being human in the current century!</p>
<p>To have the determination to sacrifice oneself for righteousness,</p>
<p>Only then can we strive for the eternal life of the country!</p>
<p>We want to live, but not to steal life,</p>
<p>(Life, must be a life of meaning!)</p>
<p>Now, every corner,</p>
<p>Is filled with the cries of killing the enemy,</p>
<p>Hot blood, hot strength,</p>
<p>Four hundred million hearts,</p>
<p>Formed into an iron-like</p>
<p>New great Great Wall!</p>
<p>Enduring all suffering,</p>
<p>Forging a tenacious and extraordinary spirit;</p>
<p>Recognizing the times, recognizing friends and enemies,</p>
<p>And even more recognizing our mission;</p>
<p>The evil iron hooves will not be driven away for a day,</p>
<p>The sacred War of Resistance will not stop for a moment!</p>
<p>Remember, then--</p>
<p>The people of all China,</p>
<p>Live--live for the nation!</p>
<p>Die--die for the country!</p>

<h3>"Prosperity Policy"</h3>
<p>— Sangzi</p>
<p>According to various reports: The culture that "Bushido" brought us early on was: burning, looting, raping, and killing; its purpose was to seek the establishment of a "new order", so they used this spirit of Yamato to destroy everything "old" of ours as much as possible. However, as a result, they were greatly disappointed. The "new order" of "scars all over, stench everywhere" was indeed created for them, but at the same time, they lost a large number of objects that could be exploited and sucked. This is a phenomenon that violates what they originally wanted, and of course they are not willing to have this phenomenon exist, so there is the implementation of a periodical "both hard and soft" policy.</p>
<p>The so-called "hard" policy is still the old set: burn, loot, rape, kill; but in order to take care of the "soft" aspect, the means used seem to be slightly more "civilized" than before. As for the so-called "soft" policy, it is simply playing tricks there, deceiving themselves and others; but the general "nouveau riche" under their wings are using it as the basis for promoting the "royal road paradise". Of course, as a result of combining hard and soft tactics, they have achieved considerable success, but before long, they have obviously failed again. Not only did the so-called "undesirable people" not bite, but even a group of so-called "good people" gradually understood their role. They also know that the content of the appeasement policy they implemented is not substantial enough, so they cannot win "popular support" and reap real benefits, so they innovate again and use the "prosperity policy" to assist the promotion of the appeasement policy.</p>
<p>The policy of prosperity is to widely establish "opium dens", "clubs" and "brothels". They incite their pawns to engage in promotion with the reason of prospering the market and increasing tax revenue. Those "nouveau riche" who have "benefits" to reap, of course, work desperately. Therefore, this policy has achieved satisfactory "results", and they are very happy because of this, believing that this can not only obtain huge amounts of wealth and save them from poverty, but also create a "prosperous" "new order" to boast to the world.</p>
<p>The isolated island is flourishing and the source of wealth is prosperous, and they are very envious of it. However, because the situation is special, it is not convenient to intervene, so they can only implement their prosperity policy in a corner of the West Shanghai, luring the general islanders to pay them "prosperity" fees every day, and recently it has spread to Hongkou and Pudong.</p>
<p>The isolated island is now surrounded by this prosperity policy that is destroying our nation's physical strength, demoralizing our nation's will, and destroying our nation's morality. The general islanders should recognize the environment and restrain their vital energy. If they die under the prosperity policy, they will not only fail their ancestors, but also fail themselves.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Road Names That Have Become History</h3>
<p>— Run Gui</p>
<p>In Shanghai decades ago, the road names were very different from what they are now. At that time, most of the road names were taken from the local place names, but these have after all been eliminated into historical names, only occasionally found in the mouths of some people. Here, you can get a complete picture of it.</p>
<p>The most familiar to the general old Shanghainese is Yangjingbang, but this is also an old name. Now, making fun of the Chinese-style English is called Yangjingbang, because Yangjingbang was the earliest place to come into contact with foreigners; in addition, the Public Concession Land Regulations Law is also named Yangjingbang Regulations Law. In fact, Yangjingbang is a river parallel to Suzhou Creek, Caohejing, and Beixin Creek at the intersection of the British and French concessions; now it has been filled in and has become the famous Edward Road.</p>
<p>The general Shanghainese also know very well about the event of Edward Road replacing Yangjingbang. A few foreigners gave special names to the roads that intersect with Edward Road; the intersection of the Bund and Edward Road is called "Outer Yangjing Bridge"; there was also a bridge at the corner of Sichuan Road intersecting with Edward Road, but later, because the river was filled in, the bridge was also gone, which is the "Second Yangjing Bridge"; at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Edward Road is the Third Yangjing Bridge. As for the intersection of Henan Road and Edward Road, it is certainly not the "Fourth Yangjing Bridge", its name at the time of its destruction was "Sanmaoge Bridge", because there was a temple at that time, and the name was "Sanmaoge". The names of these "Second Yangjing Bridge", "Third Yangjing Bridge!" and "Sanmaoge Bridge" have been publicly recognized by the bus company, and these Chinese local names are also used in the markings on the corner of the road or on the fare list.</p>
<p>At one time, two bridges were built on the surface of the Yangjingbang River, one on Hubei Road and the other on Jiangxi Road. At that time, the names were "East New Bridge" and "West New Bridge". Although the bridges have been demolished, the names are still kept. In addition, there is a unique bridge that crosses Yangjingbang on Shandong Road, which is "Daijun Bridge".</p>
<p>Most Chinese people are unwilling to say Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, and Guangdong Road when referring to the famous five roads in Shanghai, but prefer to say "Da Malu" (Great Road), "Er Malu" (Second Road), ... for convenience. Do you know "Liu Malu" (Sixth Road)? This is Beihai Road, which is a very short east-west road between Guangdong Road and Edward Road, and connects to Yu Qiaqing Road—formerly called Xizang Road (Tibet Road).</p>
<p>Chinese people also like to divide a whole road into several sections and add a special name to each section. For example, Henan Road in Nanjing Road is famous for "Paqiu Chang" (Ball-throwing Field); the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road is named "Risheng Lou" (Rising Sun Building). The origin of these names is because there will be an entertainment place or a teahouse at the corner of the road. At the corner of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road, there is also "Qipan Jie" (Chessboard Street), which is where bookstores are concentrated; however, no one knows why it is called this name. Some say that there are often many professional chess stalls set up along the road, enticing people to bet money; others say that the name comes from the fact that Henan Road, Fuzhou Road, Jiaotong Road, and Shandong Road look very much like the four squares of a chessboard. Now Fuzhou Road is famous as "Cultural Street", which is because there are many bookstores.</p>
<p>There is a "Baoshan Street" (Precious Good Street) on Guangdong Road, near the corner of Hubei Road. Although the road has been hidden, the road name is still remembered. Similarly, between Hankou Road and Hubei Road, there is a "Daxin Street" (Great New Street).</p>
<p>There are also two "Slanting Bridges" in Shanghai, but neither bridge can be found; one of them is on Jing'an Temple Road, and the other is the Slanting Bridge of Lime Harbor. Near the West Gate, there was also a bridge that surrounded the city; speaking of the city moat, now it is impossible to find its traces, and the road name is "Xinkai He" (New Opened River).</p>
<h3>Reader's Voice Two Types of "National Disaster Money" Makers</h3>
<p>— Qiuwen</p>
<p>Last month, Dr. Ma Yinchu submitted a request to the central government to severely punish those who make "national disaster money." Since the "August 13th" incident, after carefully observing in the isolated island, it is really unknown how many unscrupulous merchants are engaged in making "national disaster money." Although these unscrupulous merchants adhere to secrecy, they cannot escape the attention of the masses. As far as I know, the following two types are the most harmful ways of making "national disaster money." Of course, these are just a few of the dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of types of businesses. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a few silver shops and money houses on the isolated island (the area around a certain road being the most) began to act wildly. There are countless bosses who have made a fortune. They are all greedy for huge profits and secretly sell large amounts of red-white gold and silver coins to a certain side. They have a kind of secret deal for regular customers (such as silver shops in various counties in the interior) if they sell gold and silver to them. This kind of pupil plate exceeds the market price greatly. For example, recently, the price of each tael of sterling silver is two yuan, but they can offer two yuan and three jiao. The Central Bank exchanges hard currency for legal currency, and each yuan can increase by one jiao and five fen, but they can exchange each yuan of hard currency for one yuan and three jiao of legal currency. A few customers who are overwhelmed by profit naturally sell to them regardless of the pros and cons. However, if someone occasionally questions their outlet, they either say they directly remit to the central government, or they say they transport it to Hong Kong; or they are entrusted by a certain giant merchant to buy it on their behalf. In fact, the latter two actions are illegal. And cannot escape the crime of making "national disaster money"! As for the location where they contact customers, it is usually in a closed room in a hotel. Even the staff in the store have no way of detecting it.</p>
<p>The small rice merchants in the Zhabei, Hongkou, and Nanshi areas are inevitably affected by the war and suffer losses. Since they do not have huge capital to rebuild their old business in the concession, they perversely go astray. Since the autumn harvest in the rural areas of the interior last year, the general rice merchants have been active. First, they went to a certain side to obtain a transportation pass. Then, they agreed with a certain department of a certain side that after purchasing new rice in the interior, they would directly sell it to them as military rations. He takes a commission from it. If the quantity exceeds a certain amount, he can also ask a certain side to send someone to protect him along the way. It is said that there is indeed a considerable number of people engaged in this business on the isolated island, and there are also not a few who have become wealthy men!</p>
<p>The names "Lao Wen", "Xin Zha", and "Zhabei" can also often be heard. The meaning of "Lao Zha" is a construction of the waterline of the Blee River. Fujian Road is paved with northern materials, so it is still called "Shi Lu" (Stone Road), and Fujian Road Bridge is also named "Shi Qiao" (Stone Bridge). Speaking of bridges, Jiangxi Road Bridge is also named "Zilai Shui Qiao" (Tap Water Bridge), which is named because of the tap water stack tower next to the bridge.</p>
<p>Before it became famous, Henan Road was called "Tie Ma Lu" (Iron Horse Road). This is because the Songhu Railway passed through the north of it. A more peculiar word is "Tou Ji Qiao" (Chicken-stealing Bridge), which is at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, which means that there is a small stone bridge there, but there are no traces of it now; as for the reason for calling it "Chicken-stealing", no one knows.</p>
<p>The next road on Sichuan Road where the Chinese Youth Association is located is "Lao Jie" (Old Street)--very narrow. Before the latest construction, this was a narrow old city street filled with butcher shops, taverns, and restaurants. When the Shanghai Municipal Council decided to have the road names baptized, there were indeed many local names that were selected and adopted, such as "Wufu Long" (Five Blessings Lane), "Jin Yang Jie" (Golden Ocean Street), "Tang Jia Long" (Tang Family Lane), "Shou Jia Qiao" (Shou Family Bridge), etc. Similarly, in the central area, the north-south roads are named after Chinese provinces, such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Guizhou Road, Yunnan Road, etc.; and the east-west roads are named after major Chinese cities, such as Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Beijing Road, Guangdong Road, Suzhou Road, etc. (Translated from the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post)</p>
<h3>New Wedding Night “His Exciting Night” Produced by Universal Pictures Shown at Cathay Theater</h3>
<p>— Yanhua</p>
<p>Quel Rogges is a comedian's clown, he doesn't give me a deep impression, but I remember one thing, that he and Roland Young (who has starred in "Windy Romance") are comedians' clowns of light humor.</p>
<p>But for Quel Rogges to independently star in this "New Wedding Night", it seems that he is not qualified enough in terms of reputation and business assurance.</p>
<p>Regarding the whole play, I would like to talk about it from several aspects:</p>
<p>First, in terms of the script creation, I think that the writing technique in the local part is still quite lovely, especially after the company employee Adam was rumored to have fallen off a cliff and died, the family suspected that he was "a ghost returning to life", in the atmosphere of comedy, it has achieved very good results.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we have to point out that the abrupt and unnatural development of the story of the whole script damages the unity of the entire film. The most obvious example is: the car driver with mental problems, his appearance, his desire to commit suicide because he can't sing, etc., this can indeed be regarded as strengthening the effect of comedy, but using overly far-fetched characters or overly rigid techniques to reluctantly help this drama, then its failure is expected. The key is about the personality of the characters. In my personal opinion, writing Quel Rogges (Adam) as a cowardly and timid character should have achieved good results in this comedy, but Adam's previous cowardice and his sudden excessive bravery and rudeness after drinking, if the playwright could strengthen the opposition, then the ending of the whole play would be much better than it is now. Because in this script, at the end, Adam's brave mood after anger is too weak after all.</p>
<p>Second, what should be mentioned is naturally the director's technique. I said earlier that this play reveals this weakness in terms of atmosphere because the center of gravity written in the script before and after is uneven. That is, after Adam gets angry at the end, when he orders the company manager to admit all the insults and mistakes, the power of the drama is greatly weakened in the contrast of the drama before and after.</p>
<p>The director did not use better techniques to supplement and strengthen it for this ending, so the play loosened up uncontrollably at the end.</p>
<p>However, in the atmosphere of the whole family treating Adam as a ghost, in terms of directing techniques, it is indeed not bad, the bride's aunt faints when she sees Adam, the black servant is frightened and at a loss when he sees Adam (we always feel infinitely disgusted with the American film's portrayal of blacks as so stupid), Annie faints when she sees Adam..., these things, in the comedic atmosphere of treating people as ghosts, it does pull the audience's emotions tightly together.</p>
<p>The entire cast, except for Quel Rogges, who has a lot of screen time, the rest of the cast does not have a lot of screen time, especially the female roles seem to have too little screen time.</p>
<h3>Rain Clears Up, First Installment: One-Armed Old Man Organizes Free Village; Twin Daughters Pay Respect at Martyrs' Tomb</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Old Master Zhu's granddaughter was sent to Doctor Zhang's hospital, where Doctor Zhang took great care of her. She gave her a name, Zhu Airen, the name Airen meaning "spreading love." She taught her to read and write. Fortunately, there were many people in the hospital, including the nursing ladies. The church also ran a primary school, and Doctor Zhang treated this country girl like her own daughter. Zhu Airen was very lively, jumping in and out, and had many sisters. All her clothes were made for her by Doctor Zhang. Time passed quickly, and Zhu Airen was seventeen years old and had graduated from high school. At that time, Doctor Zhang had an American girlfriend, also a female doctor, who was about to return to her country. Doctor Zhang entrusted her to take her goddaughter, Zhu Airen, to America. Fortunately, she had a good foundation in English from her school in her own country. After studying at an American medical school for four or five years, her knowledge naturally greatly improved. Zhu Airen was no longer the country girl she once was. In fact, Doctor Zhang had a deep intention in sending her to study in America. Since Doctor Zhang established this women and children's hospital, it had gradually expanded, and its scale had become even larger. In addition to the main hospital, which was still in the large city, there were several branches, and besides the hospitals, there were also several nurseries. Even the scale of the main hospital was different from before. It covered nearly a hundred acres, and the buildings were all newly built five-story and six-story buildings. All facilities were available. Although it was a women and children's hospital, it was the most complete modern women and children's hospital. There was also a large and beautiful garden surrounding it, with clear water and lush trees, and quiet flowers and birds. Because in recent years, women have been going to the hospital for childbirth, the hospital has become increasingly busy. Although each branch hospital had a director, and each nursery also had a director, the person in charge of the overall management was still Doctor Zhang Wenqi alone. Therefore, she wanted to cultivate her goddaughter, Zhu Airen, to inherit her career in the future, so that she could entrust someone with it. After Zhu Airen returned to her country, she naturally served in her own hospital, helping her godmother, Doctor Zhang, a great deal. Although Doctor Zhang had also studied abroad, the world of medicine was changing rapidly, with countless new inventions and theories every year. The new was coming out, and the old was gradually being eliminated. What she had learned was the latest, so she naturally benefited a great deal in medicine and technology. Moreover, Doctor Zhang was busy with medical administration and didn't have time for academic research every day. (8)</p>

<h3>Appreciating Dance: 1. What is Dance?</h3>
<p>— Jiasheng</p>
<p>What is dance? This is a question that should be explained first.</p>
<p>In China, the art of dance has not yet been noticed, so the general public's concept of it is that dance is the kind of dancing that takes place in hotels or dance halls to the rhythm of jazz music, as well as the dancing of those low-taste song and dance troupes. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. Of course, that kind of dance is also a kind of dance, but in terms of the origin and development of dance, as well as cultural principles, it cannot be considered a legitimate form of dance. At most, it can only be said to be a decorative social item of the leisured class since the era of commercial capitalism, and it even harms the progress of legitimate dance.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is legitimate dance?</p>
<p>Dance originally originated from human actions. With humans, there were the basic postures of dance. When writing and painting had not yet emerged, primitive people's will and emotions were almost entirely reflected in dance and music. Later, the development of dance could not escape this task, so it can be said that dance is the organized expression of the form of human consciousness and emotion. Its content is based on the same principles as literature or other arts. The only difference is the tools of expression. In other words, dance does not use words or language, but uses the beautiful shapes and postures of human movements, whether fine lines or coarse lines, to describe human actions and emotions. Moreover, its content and postures also change with the times. For example, "prayer dances" can only be produced in a society dominated by religion.</p>
<p>2. Qualitative Analysis of Dance</p>
<p>To appreciate dance, one must first understand the essence of various dances, such as folk dance, lyrical dance, narrative dance, athletic dance, and social dance.</p>
<p>Athletic dance is only a kind of beautiful movement for cultivating physical health, and social dance fundamentally lacks artistry, so we will not discuss it. What we want to talk about here are the various meaningful dances that are staged for performance.</p>
<p>"Folk dance" is a kind of folk dance, just like folk songs in Western music, but it uses the postures of body movements to express the folk way of life. Therefore, from this kind of dance, one can recognize the characteristics of the nation and the unique postures of labor. For example, after watching the "Spanish Sowing Dance," one knows that the labor postures of Spanish farmers are clearly different from those of other nations. At the same time, when we appreciate the crude and straightforward linear postures of "folk dance," we must not despise them, but react and see that this is its characteristic. The so-called straightforward and simple beauty of farmers' movements.</p>
<p>"Lyrical dance" is a kind of dance that is extremely rich in poetry. In France, some people have called it "dance poetry." This kind of dance uses extremely delicate postures and aesthetic movements to describe soft subjects. Moreover, these subjects are often taken from beautiful myths or love stories. Appreciating this kind of dance can be regarded as the same as "nocturnes" or "tone poems" in music.</p>
<p>"Narrative dance" is like narrative poetry, using sequential postures to describe an entire historical event. Ancient narrative dances mostly described the great deeds of heroes and the comedies and tragedies of the love of knights and beauties. Medieval narrative dances naturally described God. The "Genesis Dance" was produced in this era. Modern and contemporary narrative dances mostly describe the collective actions of people. Narrative dance is the prototype of mime, but it is different from mime, because the movements of "narrative dance" are purely dance postures, without the elements of drama movements.</p>
<p>"Lyrical dance" and "narrative dance" were staged very early. "Folk dance" has also been brought to the stage in modern times. Therefore, these types of dances are called stage dances, and their effects are even more profound on the stage.</p>
<p>Since these types of dances are staged, they need to be coordinated with the conditions on the stage, such as lighting, costumes, scenery, and especially the creation of dance music and the application of dance music. When appreciating stage dances, one must not neglect the value of these objective conditions in coordinating. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Colorful Record of Theatrical Events in Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Mugong, the owner of Xiaozhilian Hall, sent a letter from the ancient capital yesterday, reporting in great detail the theatrical events in Beijing and Tianjin. His comments were insightful and penetrating. I have extracted and recorded them here to inform the readers. The ancient city has fallen, but the chrysanthemum (theater) industry has developed in a distorted way. It is truly heartbreaking to talk about. Meng Xiaodong performed the complete "Hong Yang Dong and Related Bone Stealing" in Beijing. Her teacher, Yu Shuyan, personally supervised the performance. Several "friendly nation" people, including the president of the ×× bank, watched the play. They purchased tickets from Meng's manager in advance, but only got seats in the seventh or eighth row. It was said that the front rows had already been sold in advance. However, a few hours before the performance, a large number of tickets for the second and third rows were found to be available. The bank president then bought them all at a high price and told Meng's manager that when Xiaodong took the stage, he would "draw lots" as revenge, causing her extreme embarrassment. Meng was very embarrassed and almost shed tears. She then asked someone to mediate with the bank president, and the matter was settled. Meng suffered this stimulus, and her voice suddenly lost its moisture on the stage. The bank president used his money and evil power to make fun of a singing actress, which is truly abominable. This matter caused a sensation in the theater circles of the old capital, but all the major and minor newspapers did not mention a word about it.</p>
<p>The two theaters in Beiping, Xinxin and Chang'an, will perform so-called winter relief charity performances. Xinxin has Cheng Yanqiu and Ma Lianliang's "Ganlu Temple," Hao Shouchen and Li Shaochun's "Lianhuan Tao." Xiaocuihua and Xiao Changhua's repertoire is yet to be determined. The Chang'an Theater has Shang Xiaoyun and Gou Huisheng's "Fan Jiang Guan," and Jin Shaoshan and Ben Wanchun's "Lianhuan Tao." Shaochun is the son of Li Guichun, and Wanchun is Li's son-in-law. They are performing the same play at the same time, which shows the depth of the animosity between the brothers-in-law.</p>
<p>The Tianjin China Grand Theater performed "The International Lions Club Charity Performance" for two days. The lineup of famous actors was complete, and the repertoire was also quite exciting. Ticket prices were divided into four types: five yuan, four yuan, three yuan, and two yuan. A total of more than 17,000 yuan was sold in two days. A commemorative booklet was distributed on the spot. The booklet was beautifully decorated and explained each play performed in both Chinese and English, as well as photos of the famous actors in their costumes and casual clothes. There were no flattering words of praise in it, which is very different from the special publications that are popular in Shanghai, which are full of embellishments.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu was originally scheduled to perform after the charity performance. The repertoire had been announced, and more than half of the tickets had been sold in advance. However, on the day of the performance, he suddenly published a statement in the newspaper, saying that he could not come to Tianjin due to a cold. The tickets sold were refunded. In fact, it was because the charity performance had been sold out every day for several days (there were also five days of performances by the Five Elders Association before the International Lions Club charity performance, and the attendance was also very good), and he was afraid that the good times would not last and that his business would suffer a setback. For the sake of his personal reputation, he was unwilling to continue the performance. The so-called cold was just a pretext.</p>
<h3>"The King of Chu" Undergoes a Marital Change; Yi Hua Abandons Jin Suqin; Thousands of Feet of Film are Sacrificed and Re-shot; Yu Ji is Replaced by Diao Ban Hua</h3>
<p>— Xin Shi</p>
<p>Yi Hua Company's costume film "The King of Chu," directed by Wang Cilong, was solemnly prepared for a long time. It was not until last week that the shooting began. The male lead, the King of Chu, is played by Wang Yuanlong, formerly known as the "King of the Silver Screen." Regarding the role of Yu Ji, Yi Hua initially posted a recruitment advertisement, but did not find a good candidate. After searching in many ways, they hired a famous female actor, Jin Suqin. Jin is the number one female actor in the South, with both beauty and talent, surpassing her peers for a time, and is sufficient to add color to the film. Yi Hua hired her at a high price and promised to list her as the leading actress, treating her with utmost courtesy. Unexpectedly, not long after the filming of the film, a sudden change occurred; Yi Hua suddenly and decisively abandoned Jin and decided to replace her with another actor. It is said that this incident occurred because: Jin's delicate body is very weak. She is currently singing at the Golden Theater every night and has fainted twice due to physical exhaustion. Therefore, it is inevitable that she often has difficulty arriving on time for the filming work at Yi Hua. The art of the screen is originally different from stage performance; Jin is often happy to be independent due to excessive self-confidence and fails to follow the director's instructions. At the same time, Yi Hua attaches great importance to this film; and it has been decided that it will be released in the New Light Theater starting from the New Year's Day. For this reason, they feel that the date is approaching and the relationship is not trivial, and it is difficult to delay. They then obtained Jin's consent and immediately stopped the filming. All the thousands of feet of film that had been shot were sacrificed; Diao Ban Hua was assigned to take over the role of Yu Ji and re-shot from scratch. Yi Hua's decision to change plans suddenly was not without reason. Fortunately, not much film had been completed, so the loss was not too great.</p>
<h3>Theatrical News: Renewal Stage Appoints Senior Staff</h3>
<p>The shareholders of Renewal Stage will hold a meeting tomorrow (the 10th) to discuss the overall situation in the future. It is said that the senior staff of the front and back stages have been appointed as follows: Ji Xiaofeng as general manager, Qi Jian as manager, Zhou Xiaoqing as chief inspector, Chang Yunheng as back stage manager, and Li Gang and Zhao Ruizhang as deputy managers.</p>
<p>Lin Shusen Joins Charity Performance of "Intercepting the River." Famous actor Lin Shusen will participate in the Lingjie United Association's charity performance for Pushan Villa. The repertoire is scheduled to be "Zhao Zilong Intercepting A Dou" with Zhang Wenqin. Lin has sought Zhang Wenqin's consent. It is reported that the charity performance is scheduled to be held on the 16th and 17th.</p>
<p>The Grand Theater Plans to Invite Female Actor Zhu Cuimei. The Grand Theater's female actor, Han Suqiu, is taking a leave of absence due to physical weakness. The theater is actively looking for other actors to fill the gap. It has been introduced that female actor Zhu Cuimei, who has taken refuge in Linchuan from Hunan, is being contacted. If it works out, she will leave for Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Jin Xiqin Terminates Contract with Golden Theater</p>
<p>Female actor Jin Suqin, since joining the Golden Theater, was originally scheduled to perform until the end of the year. Now, Suqin feels physically weak and has requested the Golden Theater to end her performance early. It is now scheduled to end on the 19th of the lunar month, and she will leave on the 20th.</p>
<h3>"Realizing a Dream" and Other Performances: "Guanghua Fellowship's Art and Entertainment Evening" at the YMCA</h3>
<p>— Jun Yang</p>
<p>The "Guanghua Christian Fellowship" held a "Guanghua Fellowship's Art and Entertainment Evening" at the YMCA in Baxianqiao on the 7th and 8th to help refugees. All proceeds from ticket sales were used for refugee relief.</p>
<p>The programs for the two days were slightly different. I went on the first day. The first program was the YMCA Orchestra's performance of "Overture," the second was a "Solo," the third was Wu Xiaobang's "Dance," and the fourth was the play "Realizing a Dream." "Realizing a Dream" was directed by Mr. Wu Renqi, the director of "The Beginning of Man." Audiences who have seen "The Beginning of Man" will probably not forget Mr. Wu Renqi's delicate techniques. In "Realizing a Dream," we still felt Mr. Wu Renqi's intimate touch.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Court and Theater in the Old Capital (69): The Landlord of Luoma Lake is Named Ma</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>In martial arts plays, there is a type of short play that focuses on reciting, dialogue, acting style, and posture. It is neither very noisy nor chaotic, and it can also make the audience feel excited. This type of play can be called a small martial arts play. Plays like "Evil Tiger Village," "Luoma Lake," and "Stealing the Imperial Horse" are all tightly structured and combine martial arts and literary singing. Compared to those monotonous "Overlord Village" and "　Wax Temple," they are a hundred times better. Speaking of this, it reminds people of the late martial arts master Yang Xiaolou. That kind of crisp voice and delicate acting style, will there ever be a second person who can match him? According to some old music lovers, Xiaolou's plays have all become Guangling San (a lost melody).</p>
<p>Luoma Lake is located in the territory of Pisu counties in northern Jiangsu. Although it is not as large as Suzhou's Taihu Lake, it is known to almost everyone due to the promotion of dramas. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi in the early Qing Dynasty, there was a martial arts official who guarded the gate of the harem. His surname was Ma, and I don't remember his name very clearly. This man was originally from Xuzhou. He was very cautious and law-abiding. He did not dare to do anything out of line, and he did not engage in favoritism or corruption. Therefore, he gained the trust of the Grand Chief Manager of the Eighteen Routes (Li Lianying at the end of the Qing Dynasty had this title, managing all affairs in the palace. It remains to be investigated whether this title existed in the early Qing Dynasty.) and was assigned the important task of patrolling the palace at night and guarding the gate of the harem.</p>
<p>Yinzhen (Kangxi's fourth son, later known as Yongzheng) had liked to go out of the palace for leisure since he was a child. He often changed into plain clothes and a small hat to mingle in various social levels among the people. Tea houses, restaurants, and major temples inside and outside the capital were all places he frequented. According to reports, he was fond of martial arts and knew many chivalrous people. He secretly organized a killing group called the Blood Drops to prepare for assassination if the plot to usurp the throne failed. Therefore, he often left early and returned late, rushing back to the palace before the gates closed. Because Kangxi had too many sons, he could not pay attention to his actions, so he became more and more daring later. Once, it happened to snow heavily, and the ground was covered with snow. It was very slippery underfoot, and he was also facing a headwind. He stumbled with every step and walked very slowly. By the time he finally reached the gate of the harem, he saw that the palace gate had already been closed.</p>
<p>"Realizing a Dream" depicts the fantasies of girls. They dream of having a young lover who writes them sweet love letters, sends them roses, and even gives them an engagement ring, but this is just a dream, an "unfulfilled dream."</p>
<h3>Wang Wanyu Writes Seven-Act Play "Return"</h3>
<p>— Gu Wei</p>
<p>The young writer Wang Wanying writes in a light and fluent style. His works are often published in this magazine and various newspaper drama sections and are well-loved by readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang has a considerable understanding of drama. In the past, in Shanghai and Guangdong, he organized a drama club to specially write and direct various patriotic dramas, which were performed in schools and public institutions, with excellent results. Recently, Mr. Wang, in addition to writing, is also writing a play, which is tentatively named "Return," in seven acts. The content is about a young man who returns from the battlefield: the intention is pure, and it contains a profound educational effect. The plot is bizarre and contains much criticism of society. He has now completed five acts and will finish it within this week. It has not yet been decided whether it will be performed in a theater or published as a separate book. (Pay the bill)</p>
<p>But it is said that girls hope to "realize" this kind of "fantasy," so "Unfulfilled Dream" has also been changed to "Realizing a Dream."</p>
<p>Xiao Feng's Annie is quite capable of revealing the passion that is hidden deep in the hearts of ordinary girls. She refused Han Luo, and after her final request, she still sat on the sofa by the fireplace and wrote an ideal love letter. She is trying to reveal an unstoppable girlish infatuation. Wu Wuliang, who plays Han Luo, may be lacking in stage experience, and he acted a bit too much. I think he should be at least a little gentler. Yuan Rongxiang, who plays Luo Shi, may also be "stage fright." Her voice was too low. But overall, the performance cannot be said to be bad.</p>
<p>Finally, there was Gu Chuanjie's "Selling Horses," but because I have no interest in Kun opera, I had to sacrifice the good show.</p>
