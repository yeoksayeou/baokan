<p>倫敦　波蘭駐英大使館頃發表公報稱、德國各報近頃刋載德軍在波蘭淪陷區內、迭被「武裝盜匪」襲擊、査德國方面所稱「武裝盜匪」、全屬惡意誣蔑、實則卽係我國正規軍部隊在淪陷區內賡續堅强抵抗德蘇兩國軍隊、據可靠消息、我國陸軍部隊、南面在喀爾巴阡山脈、北而在蘇伐基城一帶、正與德軍作戰、另有部隊則在西部比亞洛維柴森林地帶、繼續抵抗紅軍云（十六日哈瓦斯電)倫敦　情報部頃發表公報、略謂，德國宣傳機關迭次傳播消息、意欲令人感有一種印象、以爲波蘭國徒爲英法兩同盟國而犧牲、波國軍隊雖努力抗戰、亦於各該國無所裨補、凡此所指、全非眞相、實則英法兩國他日獲致最後勝利、有賴於波國協助之處甚多、觀於下開數點、可爲明證、（一)德軍在波蘭境內死傷之數、必較希特勒兀首所發表者爲多、渠於本月六日報吿衆議院、謂德軍陣亡一萬零五百七十二員名、傷三萬員名、失踪三千員名、實則總數當在十五萬員名左右、此項估計、原非過分、特此决戰事、旣有曠日持久之勢、則德軍在作戰初期、即有如許死傷、不可不謂多矣、(二）德軍軍械損失頗爲巨大、以坦克車而論、聞在某决進攻、喪失八十三輛、厥後波國索斯諾斯基將軍、於九月十六日在南部勒伏夫城附近一役、反攻獲勝、聞又擊毀一百輛、以空軍而論、德方損失亦復可觀、而汽油消耗數量允巨、(三)東綫德軍員額、共有七十師、因受波軍之牽制、而未克調至西綫、法國遂得從容完成動員工作、（四）德軍因應付東綫戰事之故、不得不在波國集中大隊空軍、英軍遂得安然渡過英吉利海峽、在法國登陸、（五）德軍如何使用空軍坦克車與摩託化部隊、英法兩軍觀於東綫戰况、已可洞悉無遺、（六）在東綫作戰期間、波軍陣綫並不十分强固、但德國步兵隊伍、倘無坦克車之掩護、仍未能推進、德軍諗知法國瑪奇諾防綫遠較强國、其在西綫作戰、必已感有深刻印象、又波國戰車防禦砲隊力量、雖不甚大、但仍能以重創加諸德國坦克車、職是之故、德國坦克車隊在西綫作戰時、所有駕駛員、鑒於法軍戰車防禦砲隊威力遠較强大、亦必慄慄自危、（七）波蘭軍隊堅守華沙與穆特林要　塞、卓著戰功、爲世人所欽崇、英法兩國軍隊、獲有深刻刺刺激、共作戰精神、因此愈益爲之奮一發云、(十六日哈瓦斯電)英海相邱吉爾</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本之和平運動</h3>
<p>近日日本同盟通信社數以香港電訉之方式，佈爲中國國民政府圖謀對日議和之空氣。夫如是云云而未獲左證，是爲傳說；傳說而經反證爲子虛，是爲謠言。今者左證與反證兩有不足，故同盟社電訉，實介乎傳說與謠言之間。傳說與謠言，不足爲評論之對象，然國際相處，在原則上有戰必有和，故無論國民政府謀和云云在今日爲子虛之謠言，顧議和終有成爲問題之一日；中日紛爭，牽涉至廣，故中日戰爭而告結束，實爲解決世界問題之一環；惟其然，此在中國或日本人，英法德義人，蘇聯或美國人，總之，任何人決不漠視此傳說或謠言。更據某方咋日所傳重慶電訉，謂英國駐華大使寇爾氏日前抵渝之後，蔣總裁昨予接見長談；事非公開，局外人自莫得而知所談之內容；謂知之，是妄誕；然已大足爲傳說或謠言之新資料矣。</p>
<p>自和平狀態之下赴戰，自戰爭狀態之下謀和，此國家之大問題也；對此大問題，凡百人士，意念未必盡同，然行動則不容支離滅裂而必保持其爲國家一致之行動，始得保持其爲國家。例如英國對德宣戰經月，其在野政家路易喬治氏倡爲不可遽閉談判門戶之說，其辭溫婉而其意灼然；然止於「各言爾志」之程度，未嘗遽絕張伯倫而結歡希特勒；此非路易喬治氏自信不如人，强毅不如人，蓋國家問題之大莫如和戰也。在中國則不然。中國自始迄今，非有可戰可不戰，應戰應不戰之歧途，可資選擇；徒以强寇深入，自衛圖存，實逼處此，惟有抗戰。故赴戰焉，義無返顧。及至今茲，外侮如故。阽危如故；總之，侵略狀態一日未見解脫，獨文自由一日未獲保障，則非有可和不可和，　和不應之歧途，可資選擇；蓋問題不在和戰，僅待選擇於有亡之間耳。故和戰在一般國家爲大問題，在中國則不成爲問題。謂成問題，發於重慶，非其對方幼稚之侮蔑，即其對方自訴其痴願而已。</p>
<p>就中日紛爭之根本性質言之：問題不在中日兩方，而在日本一面。抑日本方面之問題，乃在繼續侵略或放棄侵略，繼續侵略則不得不戰，放棄侵略則不和自和；故問題之本體，非所謂和戰。抑玫覈事實，問題猶不在此；蓋日本在事實上繼續侵略爲不可能，放棄侵略則不甘願。於是可知今日日本所陰謀，所策動，所焦思苦慮，千方百計以赴之者，如何不戰而得貫澈其侵略野心。即使不克貫澈其野心之全部，亦謀先使戰事至現階段告一結束而不復戰；先就現階段之侵略，收穫充分之利益。察彼動態：一使軍人固守其所侵略佔領之點與綫；行見今後軍事不務向前推進，而惟亟於所謂「掃蕩」中國在淪陷區之軍民力量，使點綫成爲平面。一使企業家金融家與工商業航運業者，爭著先鞭，排斥他國，近則侔利目前，遠則厚植基礎；收實利實益於掌握之下，使所佔領者由平面成爲立體。一使政治工作人員，在以華制華之秘訣之下，扶植工具，借刀殺人；代彼軍事侵略與經濟侵略，動則爲之前哨，爲之觸鬚，靜則爲之灑掃庭除，梭巡倉厫。一使文人學士，談仁談義，諱過飾非，天花亂墜，引人入勝，以不負責之身，簽不兌現之票，以麻醉之伎倆，期攻心之宏效。凡此四者，有無成就；爲別一問題；然日本方面今茲之數管齊下，則掩不盡天下耳目者也。</p>
<p>誠僞之辨，或僅相差一間；安見日本決不放棄侵略，竟無悔禍之誠？彼朝野人士，脣焦舌敝，鞠躬如也，豈可一筆抹煞之曰僞？是則有得反證者焉：日人方面所作一切和平運動，和平理論，皆大量出口而輸之中國之淪陷區域：若停止戰爭，平等議和，糾正既往之錯誤，發揮互尊之精誠，如是云云之大道理，却未嘗行銷於彼三島；夫何以故哉？謂此反證之不足，則有待事實行動證明放棄侵略，顧事實行動之明證又安在哉？</p>
<h3>希特勒派遣特使　赴莫斯科求援　攜有親筆函致史丹林希氏並與義首相通話</h3>

<h3>薛岳治理下　湘西局面已趨清明　野心家與綠林均覺悟並一致走上抗戰路綫</h3>
<p>長沙通信、「湘西問題」的被提出、遠在民國初年、但自臨湘岳陽相繼淪入日軍之手、湘北進入國防第一綫、湘西已成爲抗戰建國的一個重要支點後、「湘西問題」、始特別被人密切地重視和注意起來、由於過去湘西的被「視同化外」、再由於地理形勢的險要、湘西的三十一縣、(佔湖南全省土地人口三分之一强）遂成爲一般野心家們最理想的割據根據地、在這裏可以造成割據局面、經營他們自己的小天地、計自民國五年袁世凱攻打唐繼堯有一師的槍械整個消滅在湘西後、這就成爲湘西的野心家們初期興風作浪第一筆大本錢、在這本錢下、復用各種手段、擴充共實力、利用湘西廣大土地、强迫民衆種植鴉片、凡違令不種者、一律課以「懶捐」、遍設釐卡、橫徵暴歛、苛捐雜稅、如火坑稅、人頭稅等等、名目之多眞是到了登峯造極的程度</p>
<p>中心問題</p>
<p>野心家們在橫徵暴歛之餘、更涉用其軍事的政治的力量、實行「三抓主義」和「四不管政策」所謂三抓主義、是（一）有勢力者要抓、目的藉此可警戒其他有勢力者、不敢出而干預其行勁、（二）有錢者要抓、藉此可得贖款、（三）過路客要抓、所謂「買路錢」、四不管政策、是（一）、土匪搶刦不管、（二）、官員貪污不管、（三）、衙門賭牌不管、（四）、散兵滋擾不管、在這「三抓主義」和「四不管政策」下、所謂湘西問題、就形成了三個中心問題、二、「土王」問題、代表較大野心家的勢力、二、「土匪」問題、代表一般零星散匪、三、「土膏」問題、卽鴉片、這三個中心問題的爲首一字、都爲「土」字、於是一般人稱湘西問題者、也就是三土問題、在三土交加壓迫下的湘西千餘民衆、爲自衛計、消極的購買一部份武器以自保、積極的也就聚集黨徒、嘯集山林、作他們「打家刦舍」的營生、以致弄到在某些地方、在某個時期、「兵民匪」三位一體分不了家、過去、有什麼人經過湘西不遭搶刦、簡直是罕有的事、後來逐漸地小的部隊如一排或一連過湘西、竟也會全部被繳械、湖南大學自長沙遷辰谿、爲保護師生安全計「月繳保險費」三百元、但這個保險費、僅擔保在該校周圍五里路以內不出亂子、過此、則概不負責、至於湘黔公路和沅江水路、刦車刦船、竟是層出不窮、司空見慣的事、在這種種不同的傳說下、或是有許多短視的人們、都以湘西是一個不可理解的「亂」、或竟以爲湘西社會、尙停留在黑暗的中國古時代、</p>
<p>結所在</p>
<p>湘西的成爲問題、有許多人認爲由於「湘西民性特殊」和整個湘西社會的「貧」「弱」「愚」「亂」、其實湘西的民衆、一樣是黃帝的子孫、湘西漫山遍野埋藏着無盡的寳藏、鋁鉛·鋅·煤·鐵·木材·桐油·茶·共最著者、允共是·銻和桐油、在每年中國出口貨中佔一個極重要的數字、這足證湘西幷不貧、湘西民衆的刻苦耐勞的精神、遠爲他處所不及、湘西的土匪、能以少勝多、過去在東戰塲嘉興一帶、展開光榮一戰的顧家客師、全係湘西人、何得謂之弱、湘西的敎育、確然不普及、文化水準、遠較他處爲低、封建勢力、亦比他處爲大、但這並不能認爲湘西人民先天較他處爲愚、湘西多亂是事實、但亂的根源幷不在「民心好亂」而在少數野心家們企圖以征服的方式來佔有湘西、一部封建遺物借匪自重、藉地方病亂以延續其日幕途窮的生命、因之、湘西地方政治、始終不得上軌道、吏治始終談不到澄淸、民衆在層層暴力與「三土」壓迫下、納完苛雜、還是得不到安居、於是只有起而自衛、甚至挺而走險了、湘西問題的根本癥結在那裹、千言萬語、一句話乃在「土王」和因「土王」所造成的「土匪」「土膏」、苛雜暨政治與人民的脫節、</p>
<p>問題解決</p>
<p>薛岳將軍自本年二月奉命兼主湘政後、卽揭櫫安便足三字、而對於湘西的問題、允抱澈底解決的最大決心、本年來將湘西的苛雜逐漸廢除、選援對於政治有修養之軍事人才、充任縣長、澈底澄淸湘西吏治、减輕人民負擔、允其對於「士王」的淸除、罌粟的禁種、匪患的根絕、原來湘西的匪多、因「民不聊生」被迫走上爲匪的道途、自經薛主席將「土王」淸除後、對匪決採剿撫兼施恩威併用的辦法、當此日軍業已跨入湘省大門、富有血性的湘西健兒、經薛主席再四剴切曉諭、激以大義、終於一致拋棄原非得已的綠林生活、走上了爭取民族解放的戰塲、是多難的血的五月某一個淸晨、湘西健兒在戴孝韜龍雲飛兩將軍率領下、分由湘西各個城鎭、各個山林、各個角落、集合到沅澧、再由沅澧出發到湘北前錢、他們的脚下都一律穿着水草鞋、肩着槍、背着棕葉斗笠、眼看着大隊過去了、接着又是一隊兩隊、隊伍是這樣整齊、紀律是這樣嚴明、戴將軍在沅澧各界舉行歡送大會上說得好、「一個軍人的天職、在平時是保民、在戰時是衛國、何况這决是發動全民的對日抗戰、所以這就是軍人的神聖任務了、不必熱烈歡送、我們也應當跑上前綫去搏鬥、爲了國家的獨立、爲了民族的自由、犧牲是最光榮的、犧牲個人的生命、卽可延長子孫的生命　犧牲湘西軍人的生命、卽可延長湘西人民的生命、全國人都抱定犧牲自己的生命來爭取最後勝利」、念多年來懸而未決的湘西問題、這正象徵着這决偉大民族解放鬥爭的前途、對於從國家民族利益爲前途參加到抗戰行列里來的這支湘西生力軍、我們僅致以最崇高的敬意和寄以無限的熱望、</p>

<h3>金融　籌碼轉鬆　現金不易抬頭</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、趨勢轉疲、蓋以外匯帶硬、及利空消息又濃、故港帮雖未改變其一貫作風、然吸胃已不若以前之健、而一般浮戶多頭、鑒於環境不佳、脫手之念油然而生、是以塲中籌碼頗見充斥、遂由鬆懈、漸向下游、一度幾退入四千元大關、惟結果維持有力、祗軋小十四兀、當日情勢初尙堅穩以四千零二十三元高價開盤、嗣因外匯硬化、未稍變更、而證券帮及散戶巳抱吐售之決心、兼客帮鮮有購進、迨至午收巳跌至四千零零八元、午後又聞外匯再鬆、故扒者奇缺、終以證券帮之猛撳、遂以四千元低價開盤、旋以港帮突來搜買、致牽引證券帮之空頭抵補、曾拉高十餘元、終則以四千零十元收盤、前途因歐戰日內有猛力發展之勢、及中國之勝利消息、雪片飛來、逆料金價上漲、殊非易事、當天交易稍淸、的七百兩光景、銀樓飾金終日未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤所跌甚微</p>
<p>自晨每條(十兩)初開局勢尙穩、較上日祇做小「元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲叫千〇二十三元、少頃聞外匯略形硬化、遂引起散多賣戶、兼銀樓帮亦稍來套售、市勢步步下降、竟又撳小十二元、現金號吐予某金號十兩、爲四千〇十一元、此後某金號趁低收買、同時散戶亦供意轉淡、致稍回高、某金號進錢兌業及同　數十兩、曾一度抬高至四千〇　八元、旋以證券帮忽來拋出、　買者興趣頗淡、立又步降十元、金號賣予錢兌業三十兩、爲四千〇〇八元、時某錢兌業代客稍吸、拉上五元、某錢兌業進同業二十兩、價爲四千〇十三元、將近午刻、證券帮賣風叉起、形勢重虛、證券幫賣予金號三十兩、爲四千〇〇八元作午收價、午後初開因外匯又稍帶硬、且進者缺乏、竟較午收價撳小八元、金號售予錢兌業十兩、爲叫千元、後證券帮忽獲利復進、加之港帮跟踪活動、雖銀樓帮乘機套賣、及錢兌業代散戶等吐售、但一時頭寸仍感求過於供、不久即回升十五元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千〇十五元、入後進者漸少、頓見降落八元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業廿兩、爲四千〇〇七元、晚收時銀樓帮吸進數十兩、遂拉高三元、某銀樓進錢兌業十兩、爲四千〇十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌十四元、全天二十三元差度、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤須高十元、收進則减低三十元光景、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、因烚赤仍無甚變動、故始終未更、大同行仍懸四百〇五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减低二十元之譜、</p>
<h3>外匯買賣觀望中　美匯遠期猛長掉期已見乹攏</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛脾、仍無變動、英美滙暗市、晨初因海外美對英匯兌又回長二分、致開盤局勢續吿英緊○三一二五、美則無榮辱之狀、中途雖外行有利大通等稍有吃胃、但因華行前來吐塞、兼市上利空消息仍熾、故其他扒者、頗形寥落、致趨勢終稍鬆硬、迨上時半後、買賣均懷觀望、當時情况愈形靜寂、午收美匯又略帶硬、而英金毫無變動、午後華商稍有拋出、且美行亦起賣意、致形勢不支續鬆、結果英硬〇四六八七五、美亦長〇九三七五、至期貨趨勢、因外行賣意較殷、故本月份與現貨遂見軋平、而十一月期亦稍軋攏、全天交易平淡、</p>
<p>市況殊為沉寂</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期縮二五、遠期跌一二五、紐約銀價降半分、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法·等各滙俱平、美對英長二分、對滬昂五分、對法大一分三七五、中央掛脾各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士五三一二五、美匯七元五三一二五、較之前收、英微緊〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、乃匯兌回長之故、開後初時情况沉寂、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小二分半、此後華行如上海等前來拋出、兼某行亦稍吐售、但外行如大通有利等吃胃尙佳、致市勢仍無甚幻變、祇略現硬化、計華行吐予大通有利現貨英金四便士五六二五、繼而上海與某行售予外行現貨美匯七元五六二五、十時半後、成交益少、是以過程益無精彩、直至午收、英金未有變動、美滙則又稍帶硬、英仍計四便士五六二五、美爲七元五九三七五、比晨開英回鬆〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、</p>
<p>午後稍有賣戶</p>
<p>後市行勢仍平、為狀續稍</p>
<p>帶硬、聞華商首先賣予某行現貨英金四便士五九三七五、入後美行亦吐予同行現貨英金四便士五九三七五、並現貨美匯七元六二五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士五九三七五、美匯七元六二五、本月份與上價相同、十一月份英金四便士五三一二五、美匯七元半、（以上價格、對於華商與洋行等結進、恐難如願、)結果比上日現貨英鬆〇四六八七五、美硬〇九三七五、期貨英長〇六二五、美猛鬆一五六二五、</p>
<p>香港匯市無變</p>
<p>香港十七日電、今日匯市晨開平平、各地匯價均無榮辱、十一時三十分平穩不動、午後申匯微降一元、爲三百二十六元、下午二時三十分、開盤穩定、行情無變化、</p>
<p>天津匯價鬆動</p>

<h3>證券　內債堅昂　外股稍回</h3>
<p>昨日統一公債暗盤市况、經一度盤旋而後、趨勢又復堅俏、市氣再吿上漲、蓋因時作時輟之和平空氣、續又塵囂於市、見仁見智、雖不値識者之一顧、但未免引起一般意志淺薄投機家之興奮、且戰事進行順利、金融極臻鞏固、雖以利多空氣蠭至、多方紛紛納進、勢頗煥發、而拋者見高脫售、角逐至爲劇烈、故市價上騰受阻、僅漲起三角至四角五分、成交平淡、的六十餘萬元、綜觀市氣如無特殊刺激、當仍有盤旋中帶挺之可能也、</p>
<p>股票、華商電氣股成交二百股、價五元六角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、開盤堅穩、入後略轉軟化、價格稍有回落、會得豐股昨除息五元後、曾高至六十二元、但此價未能久持、在稍低價下、作竟日盤旋、怡和紗廠股交易頗旺、但市况無進展趨向、從事迴旋耳、收盤較最高價跌落五角、國際信託公司股甚活潑、惟晨初漲起之價、後幾退盡、耶松船廠股猛騰至一百十七元、成交極巨、橡皮股方面、著名者數種較有活動、收盤時亦趨軟、市塲經數呈期之活躍與拉提、頃始略吿回疲、爲無足驚奇之事、</p>
<p>本埠祥茂洋行經理之央商怕丁橡皮有限公司昨董事會議決定於十月二十七日起、開派截至一九四〇年四月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣四分、</p>
<p>倫敦十六日電、今日央商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、煤礦股稍見上升、　麥加利銀行股升五先令、爲七鎊正、開平煤礦股升一先令三便士、爲十三先令九便士、朝鮮煤礦股亦升一先令九便士、爲五先令六便士、其餘小動、</p>
<p>倫敦十六日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市大致均吿平穩、僅克利斯浦降落半鎊、價爲十七鎊半、</p>
<h3>糧食　杜粳平穩　客秈到稀獨堅</h3>
<p>米市來源河下仍無到、車</p>
<p>輪包子來蘇崑楓嘉等新貨四千餘包、本鄉去路早市仍活、故客家心思猶堅、各貨價一律喊高三五角、迨午時零躉銷塲復懈、市勢趨平、故收盤行情以先緊後疲、結果定局、計做開常錫特破三十二元、高卅元次二十七元、蘇同常崑白破自二十七元至廿五六元、新粳高二十八元、市二十六元、决至二十四元、靑角窰種乏貨無市、楓嘉百哥高二十八元、决至二十六元半、特羊尖二十三元二角、至二十一元半、蘆尖特二十三元六七角至二十二元、江北尖十九元二三角至十九元、南京特尖十九元八角、高十九元叫五角、中市十九元、蕪湖特尖十九元五角、市十九元、中十八元八角、次至十八元三角、　尖十七兀七角至十七元半、陳變元三十一元至三十元、新白元二十五六元、統市成交數萬餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、連日本客走銷漸旺、</p>
<p>昨市續見上砌、雖本市棧存尙充、然以江北秈已因不敷成本、後辦均已中止、邇日到頭逐减、京蕪各秈近日到數亦减、日商亦乏整批故出、昨又以採辦證問題之謠傳、人心向上、且內地鄉莊店舖零戶需胃不袞、價又漲二三四角、京蕪頂秈開至二十元〇三四角、大市貨十九元半左右、中决十八元半至十八元左右、　米十七八元間、糙米十六元左右、</p>
<h3>粉價轉定　小麥又升二角</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉廠盤已轉定局、正牌二號粉續開七元二角現鈔、回籠貨市面亦趨平和、因南北兩帮實銷略怠、均有擇小再辦之意、故市面已少興奮、兵船牌轉棧貨續開七元一角以上、老車與紅藍福新牌棧單與廠盤相仿、統市成交三四萬包、聞日廠之風凰牌粉亦以囤戶傾吐、價乃回鬆至六元八角四五分、麵粉今日有四千包、運香港、又二千包、運往新加坡、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥續見昂挺、蓋自前日一度猛漲後、人心頗爲興奮、均擬善價而沽、廠方及囤戶進胃俱懈、統市福新阜豐兩廠合辦一千五百包、囤戶祗辦一二車、最高價爲十元零三角、較前續升二角許、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗多頭少興　市盤跌勢尚緩</h3>
<p>紗市益覺萎靡不振、局勢不離徘徊之境、香港內地兩帮、需要微見活絡、然採辦額子微乎其微、故市塲人心未能提起也、一般投機商鑒於環境欠佳、不利多方、對於買進一層絕少興奮性、但一般殷富人士囤藏之額、未見放出、所以實需雖滯、而籌碼益感增加、市盤跌勢尙屬迂緩也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開依然散漫無勁、</p>
<p>開盤始做二十支天女現貨五十包、價爲六百七十九元、係同行成交、其他掮客雖在喊、然買戶寥若晨星、雙馬呌賣者更湧、然吃客遲遲、相延多時、現貨開價爲七百十二元、跌一元、棧單價爲六百九十七元、但皆係臨時搶帽子性質、迨至收盤時又見鬆落二三元、查半日成交一千三百〇八包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、天女漲五元、雙地球漲二元、廠方由永安廠開出十支嘉禾二百包、價爲五百三十元、今日有棉紗七十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<h3>棉花買賣　同業比較活躍</h3>
<p>本棉交易、較前為暢、日廠</p>
<p>對於白包花略有需要、至於華廠僅新生購辦外、其他紗廠絕鮮生氣、惟同業方面進出轉趨活潑、售價尙在平穩之境、蘇北來派尙堪維持、到通州花二千零八十八包、北沙來三百五十件、常陰沙未聞有到、出口今日有四百九十五件運港、茲將現棉售盤及包額列左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因匯兌之呆定、各方交易毫無起色、廠方靜抱覜望、同業間亦因而不願動辦、故交易殊爲靜寂、日來通州到貨殊爲擁擠、此乃廠方抱觀望之主因也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初</p>
<p>頗形堅定、而呈活躍之狀、國內廠需亦漸見通暢、布疋銷路亦見起色、故引起同業之購買、及一部份空頭抵補、直至收盤市價較之上日漲起五六磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、埃及跌卅磅音、利物浦跌四便士、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布手貨　廉價脫售</h3>
<p>布市本客幫及國外現銷略有發展、市勢轉穩、惟以散戶手貨鬆價脫售、各布一部份市盤續趨下跌、價頗混亂、白貨輕重磅粗布每疋跌五分至一角半、細布。細斜極尠做開、每疋跌二角之譜、漂染布絨布大市平定、少數仍有廉價、本街批發門市號除實需各貨續有添配外、心思極淡、粤帮除裝運預定各貨外、新額並無購胃、甬幫辦輕重磅粗布印花絨一百餘件、閩幫辦色布·色斜·細布三四十件、國外孟買宿務新加坡各地辦胃仍健、成交紅洋標。印花布。色丁四千餘疋、</p>
<p>東疋昨白貨色貨先跌後回結果平穩、晨市龍頭細布低盤售過二十元、後市回至二十元〇二角半、四君子嗶嘰降至每碼六角三分半、旋亦回升六角四分半、蓋因洋行開盤尙昂、北帮略有採辦、同業心思稍趨穩定耳、聞行家做出細布共計四百件左右、龍頭本月份訂開價每疋二十元〇五角、下月份二十元〇七角半、北銷以秦皇島進胃較健、成交細布。細斜三百餘件、津帮辦二百餘件、本街染廠亦進三四百件、</p>
<p>出口布疋、今日有四十件、運往新加坡、又四百五十件、運香港、又一百八十五件運海防、</p>
<h3>不顧價錢貴　呢絨生意特旺</h3>
<p>呢羢嗶嘰依然直前上漲、非但目前需銷之秋冬貨、即開年春夏需銷各貨、亦莫不居爲奇貨、所奇者貨價雖飛漲、去路仍不弱、即海上孤島、實銷暢盛、校之戰前有過之無不及、呢羢貨價在舊歲此時添購呢羢嗶嘰衣料、出一元三四角一尺代價、可得全毛上等西貨、其經濟者購剪巾織品、每尺七角餘亦可辦到、今則最起碼看不上眼者、每尺須售一元一二角、欲得上等全毛西洋貨、非出三元以上一尺靴以　得、其向西服店定製西裝舊　普通代價每套四十五元、粗　穿着亦不遜矣、目下出六十元一套、其面子裹襯等尙不及舊日爲佳、又長毛羢女大衣一襲、舊時七十餘元可定得、現非百元關外難辦、可見呢羢上漲之一般、</p>
<h3>油餅　投機操縱　豆油狂抬　至七十元</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、又創駭人聽聞之最新紀錄、在上午承上日之餘威、且人心本屬緊張、致開盤即猛跳一元半、午後一般操縱商劇烈拉抬、大戶推波助瀾、造成亘古罕有之驚人高價、計神戶油七十元收盤、成交一百五十桶膠州豆油一百件、價至五十元、靑歧油十件、價爲五十元零五角、烟歧油五十件、價亦爲五十元零五角、白絞桶油念桶、價爲六十五元、白絞聽油五百聽、價至六十五元五角、溫州聽油一百八十聽、價爲六十三元五角、以上成交數完全是互相受授、實銷反見却步、蓋內地錫常當地市價、因各方廠坊大都有貨應市、致行情每在滬市之下、所以昨之暴漲、其去路不能蟬聯、故預測恐橫跳必有暴挫云、查生油今日有一千零八十聽運往香港、又有生仁三百八十包、豆子六百包、遝香港又運往新加坡有豆子一千九百五十包、豆餅二千塊、</p>

<h3>滬西越界築路問題　由領團研究解決　稅收問題似為本案癥結偽方收捐已遇若干阻礙</h3>
<p>十七日法文上海日報載、據公共租界工部局消息、關於界外之馬路問題、其與上海「特別市政府」之爭執、當即移交於上海領事團解決之、依工部局之意、此案爭執點最巨者、不惟爲警權問題、抑且尙有稅收問題、而此越界築路旁各房屋、固均享受局方公用事業之利益也、故此事應移交領事團、由領事團解決之爲宜、僞市府在滬西越界築路之種種越軌行爲、以及企圖奪取租界當局之稅收、工部局已訴之上海領事團、記者昨謁工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥氏、詢問其意見、</p>
<p>希望住戶向局繳捐</p>
<p>據費氏答稱、工部局希望越界築路上住戶、仍以捐稅繳諸局方、惟不欲採取任何直接行動、至事件之爭議、已訴諸領事團辦理矣、記者又問、工部局是吾將勸吿越界築路住戶拒交捐稅與其他機關、費氏稱、甚爲抱歉、恕余不能答復此問題、</p>
<p>領團開會日期未定</p>
<p>記者又從租界常局方面探悉、領事團開會討論越界築路問題、尙未定有日期、茲不過由有關公共租界之各國總事個別加以研究而已、</p>
<p>受影響厥為華人</p>
<p>惟以目下狀况而言、僞市府在越界築路區域收取捐稅、受影響者厥爲華人住戶、而該區西人住戶、因受各該國領事之保護、均能拒絕向工部局以外之機關交繳捐稅、是以僞市政府財政局向越界築路外人住戶試收房捐地稅、每决均享閉門羹、但據西人方面意見、該區華人住戶、以此間現無中國政府當局、故殊無申訴之地位、實爲今决越界築路捐稅問題癥結之所在</p>
<p>外僑反對發生困難</p>
<p>字林報云、日方「新申報」刊載一訊、表示上海「市府」在西區界外馬路一區微收一市捐」、已因外僑居民與外國商號經理之關係、而遇困難、該報承認「西區稽徵處」主任已呈請「市府外交處」與公共租界當局繼續談判、而談判目的、乃在使「市府」能向該區中居住與經商之外人牧捐、</p>
<p>已收房捐成績不佳</p>
<p>該報又稱、「市府一自本年三月起在該區甚有限之地帶內開始徵收房捐、嗣經磋商後、得在更大之區域內徵收較多之房捐、迄今爲止、收得房捐達二寓兀、向愚園路與公共便利缺乏地點之居民收捐、頗感困難、惟此等問題、已吿解決、至於向該區外人收捐事、「稽徵處主任」朱某最近呈請「市府」商諸公共租界當局、以解決此問題云、按「市府」於數星期前欲徵收「冬季房捐」時、曾宣佈外僑亦當納捐、</p>
<p>傳美當局奉新訓令</p>
<p>外訊、關於日人近在租界內種種非法舉動、現已引起各領團之嚴重注意、據某外人詳細電吿該國政府後、頃已奉到新訓令、對日方非法舉動、有有所聲明、日內將有新發展、</p>
<h3>新太古輪乘客　三百餘人遇難　調頭遇風不及五分鐘沉沒日船主缺少經騐致肇此禍</h3>
<p>日淸公司代理時津汽船株式會社、所屬太古十八號丸·新太古丸·兩艘、行駛新港口岸(靖江縣屬)綫、新太古丸前晨(十六日）由新港來滬(咋誤出口)、滿儎貨物、乘客有叫百餘人之多、已超出規定之數駛至距吳淞口十二海哩處、燈塔附近、斯時風猛浪大、又因客貨已過量、遭遇風浪後、船身不能支持船主日人、爲挽救危險計、將船駛近淺灘避免覆沉之虞、不意船頭向右調動、滴遭風塊猛擊、巨浪壓來、船遂向右傾覆、不滿五分鐘、船貨完全沉沒、乘客均遭滅頂、移時十分鐘、風浪漸小、</p>
<p>遇難乘客三百餘人</p>
<p>在沉沒時、雖有某日商拖駁一艘、拖帶猪駁二隻、又有安和·漢和·等輪經過、因風浪猛烈、又係滿儎、以致無法施救、昨日報載漢和輪救起六十餘人、全係誤傳、至乘客四百餘人中、祇出事後日方急派所擄之我國逸仙砲艦救起四十九人、及某一日輪撈起十八人、其餘恐完全葬身魚腹、獲救者有一婦因飲水過多殞命、船員中、二日人一爲船主一爲大副、同遭溺斃、日淸公司前日據報後、即派淸山丸駛赴出事處施救、當晚返滬、一無所獲、聞昨晨又由日運輸艦橋丸、裝有救起之搭客十七名、旋續有一小輪亦救得乘客的二十名、均於楊樹浦登岸</p>
<p>海關警告航輪注意</p>
<p>至江海關方面、則因該輪沉沒處適爲交通要道、爲避免危險計、業於昨日上午發出警吿、曉論各航輪經過沉輪處時、須特別注意、或恐不愼觸及沉輪、發生意外、同時昨日海關之救生小艇有多艘、派往施救、但該輪已全部沒人水中、故無法施救而回、</p>
<p>全輪損失百萬以上</p>
<p>茲悉該新太古輪載重一百零八噸、長八十五英尺、船主爲日人野母、全輪日籍人員的二十餘人(現均失踪)、裝有大批棉花及雜貨、的値一十餘萬元、全船損失、的一百餘萬几、昨日東亞海運會社大班山中等、亦均乘船前往出事地點勘察、現正在辦理善後中、</p>

<p>辨為真劵</p>
<p>因該劵曾遭水浸、以致糢糊不淸、因分幣券印有地紋、僞造殊非易事也又本埠兩租界電車公司所發行之各種代價券、流入民間爲數極鉅、惟以彼此通用日久、頗多破爛不能再用、加之中行之新券、已經全部在市面流通、對於此種代券、事實上</p>

<h3>西服業女工潮　調解無效陷於僵局　勞方要求加資百分之百資方登報擬招用新工人</h3>
<p>西服業女裝工人三百餘人、因要求資方增加工資百分之百未遂、於十一日下午起、開始罷工、其問雖經雙方互派代表調解、但因條件懸殊、致仍僵持、茲誌詳情於後、</p>
<p>實行罷工</p>
<p>西服業女裝工人三百餘、以滬上生活程度增高、於本月十一日、向資方提出增加工資百分之百要求、而資方以爲滬上各業、增加工資之事雖有、但無增加百分之百之例、故僅允增加百分之二十、（即每件在二元以下者加五角、）勞方因此答覆、與所提條件、相差過遠、乃實行罷工、</p>
<p>陷於僵局</p>
<p>自罷工後、勞方即推楊寳珊·翁良生·陳小道·三人爲代表、經資方承認後、於十五日下午一時、在蓬吉里會所開調解會、齊方派林正人等出席、勞方仍堅持增加工資百分之百之條件、其所持理由、爲已有五家西服店承認此項條件、但資方認爲此五家非正當商店、不能引以爲例、且滬上各業之增加工資、亦無增加百分之百之例、現已允增加二成、可稱公允、雙方仍陷於僵局、十六日雖仍開調解會、但毫無結果、</p>
<p>資方措置</p>
<p>調解決裂後、公會方面即備函呈報納稅華人會、報告罷工經過、及今後措置、並刋登啟事、由全體女裝西服店臨時推定陳慶棠爲總務、徐小棠爲財務、張文星爲幹事、杜某與戴某負責招聘新工友、如工人有願意遵從資方增加工資二成（即每件大衣工資在二元以下者加五角）者、可依舊復工、若仍堅持百分之白之工資者、則予以解散、</p>
<p>原料飛漲</p>
<p>該同業公會分男裝與女裝二部份、男裝業會員有二百餘家、女裝業二十家、男裝工人的計三千餘人、女裝工人的三百餘人、自歐戰發生後、原料猛漲、而滬市之購買力、亦復較前减少、致營業亦較淸淡、該業工人工資每月所得平均在六十元以上云、去年十一月閒、亦曾發生罷工風潮、旋因資方允加工資二成而平息、今則不幸又發生此類事件、不獨勞資雙方、均蒙不利、而一般定做新衣之顧主、因不能及時試穿新衣、亦有不便之感、</p>

<h3>平望里槍案妓女慘死　保鏢應負罪責　兇手既逸後胡亂開槍過失殺人兩保鏢扣押昨解法院候偵查訊究</h3>
<p>浙江吳興人李鼎士、住虹口施高塔路八十六號、向充惠民奶粉公司董事兼總經理職務、最近因趨奉而得日人之歡、委任爲偽「上海市政府公用局局長」之職、於是李即登報辭去惠民公司本兼各職、</p>

<h3>不守婦道　控夫傷害　處拘役四十天</h3>
<p>南市蓬萊市塲主人匡仲謀之决午匡寳煉（今年二十七歲）、近因被其姘婦程梅芳（今年二十歲、漢口人、係曾爲詐騙珠寳等物被第二特院判處徒刑之婦人程陳氏之女）、投法租界捕房控告傷害、致被捕房依傷害罪向第二特院刑庭提起公訴、該案昨由朱楚哲推事開刑</p>
<p>八庭審理</p>
<p>被告匡寳煒委姜屏藩律師出庭辯護、先由姚肇第律師代表法租界行政當局陳述根據告訴人程梅芳之告訴而起訴之案情後、朱推事即據以訊問被告匡寳煒、當據匡供稱、我與程梅芳同居有六年之久、當初亦係友人介紹、初尚相安、她（指程梅芳）跟我已經生了兩個孩子、除夭折一名外、尚有一子、今年四歲、戰後、我</p>
<p>一度失業</p>
<p>近來我雖在江西路亞美無錢電公司服務、但月薪僅四十元、我將所有月薪都給她、亦不能使她滿意、她的母親和兄弟都住在漢口路美仁里、該處房屋係我父親之財產、不要出房錢、以我所收入之月薪來維持生活、亦可不致凍餒、不料她另有企圖、時常吵鬧、且夜間她時常到十二點回來、甚至</p>
<p>澈夜不歸</p>
<p>大概在三個月之前、我把四歲孩子、領到蒲石路六九八弄九號我父母的住所中暫住、希望她悔改、後來她請范剛律師寫信來、說我遺棄她、本月一日在愛多亞路遇見她、把她領到蒲石路來是希望同居、不料她仍舊恣意吵鬧、幷無人打她、她又自己出去、第二天她打電話來恐嚇、旋領捕房人來呌我</p>
<p>到捕房去、她說我打她、實在天曉得、庭上又訊問告訴人程梅芳、據程供稱、我嫁匡寳煒已六七年、當初兩性間情感彌篤、近幾年來迭受虐待、此决被打傷、不得已而告狀，庭上訊其是吾正式夫妻、而程氏答詞支吾、雖謂結婚、但說不出年月日、庭上向程氏諭曰、你如告遺棄、你是有自救能力的人、如要生活費、亦</p>
<p>不能證明</p>
<p>是正式夫妻依本院看、還是不打官司、仍有吋居希望、程氏聞論仍稱、要告匡寳燎傷害、庭上諭令辯論一過、當庭判決匡寳燎傷害他人身體、處拘役四十日、得以二元折算一日、易科罰金、匡寳燎聞判、當庭聲明不服、決提上訴、</p>

<h3>緊張的場面</h3>
<p>— 一旡</p>
<p>通過了兩個外國看門員的防區，好像跌入一熱暈和人聲交轟的區域，抹一抹頭髮上臉上淋着的水點，開始遺忘了在馬路上是一個嚴肅的秋雨和濘糊泥漿的世界。</p>
<p>從人的肉弄中擠到看台上，正好這一盤的賭博快決定最後的命運。六個穿紅色號衣的羅宋人把六條編號的狗推到鐵籠裏，發令員白旗輕輕一揮，一個雷兎從塲子那面奔馳過來，接着六條狗像離弦的流矢，齊向目的物追逐。本來人們的態度是多麽的從容安閒：吸着香煙，靠着籐椅吃茶，議論着那一號狗那一天跑第一的。可是這一刻可不對了，大家都站起來伸長了蕷子，注視着廣塲中二十四條奔竄的狗腿，心裏默念着自己買的號數，眼睛直瞧着那一隻狗的前後和决序。在我近旁一位戴眼鏡的先生，他欣悅的呌起來；「呵！二號！可是二號狗眞不爭氣，轉圈的時候和六號衝突起來，順利地讓五，一號追出前面。那位先生氣得緊，等不到對面裁判員紅綠燈的報告，已把票子撕得粉碎，往半空中一撩，鈔票已經飛到別人袋中去了。</p>
<p>這三十秒鐘的緊張局勢，會使人的心臟也停止了活動而感着窒塞的苦悶。</p>
<p>重復回到溫和的買票間裏。在人叢中，我感着渺小的難堪，有許多人的目光都注意着我，鄙視我，好像說：「窮小子你也配到這裏來嗎？多寒澀！」巡捕對我行注目禮，牆上貼着「當心　手」的招貼，好像正爲我呢。</p>
<p>不錯，這是有錢的中國紳士們玩够了女人，打疲了麻將，到這裹來換換口味的；看跑狗，未始不是沉寂的孤島中作樂的方法。但是擺在我當前的一個疑問，我發覺賭錢的到有一半不是眞的有錢的，他們存着的，是倖運和貪婪的心理的</p>
<p>這時候我留心每個人的動態：</p>
<p>在陰暗的角落裏，有一個很瘦很瘦眼睛嵌在深眶裏，好像鴉片烟尚未抽足的樣子，他掏出一本歷來跑狗的紀錄本，和專刊對照今天的節目，他的專心連香煙火蒂燒到手指也不覺得。</p>
<p>有兩人的對話很幽默。第一個說：「你不聽我的話，不買五號黃獅蹄。」又一個說：「二號不是很好嗎？要不打架，準跑第一——看得真呌人氣死，我恨不得替它跑呢。」</p>
<p>在酒吧間裏一個很胖很胖的人，夾着一枝雪茄，幌着頭，呌boy去領彩金，boy領了一大紥鈔票來，可是被旁邊一隻潔白的纖手輕輕按住，她靈捷地取過一張五兀票給boy，於是熟悉的放進自己的皮夾中去，面上浮狐媚的笑。大塊頭說：「這算什麽！」</p>
<p>「你不要活現世，還是回去，賭本不够，必輸無疑的。」在我後面傳來這樣的聲浪，我不好意思當即回頭去瞧他們，跑得遠點，看來是小店裏的職員，一個大年紀的和小年紀的在說。</p>
<p>時間到了，我雜在人海之中，腦筋裹被混沌與雜亂的黑手抓着。這是個被戰爭遺忘的世界，沒有飢餓，沒有苦痛，只有賣淫式的笑聲，有得意地咀嚼骨髓的人，有……</p>
<h3>健全的體格與健全的精神</h3>
<p>大世界對面廣告脾的霓紅燈光照映在街心，使每一個行路人在匆忙中抬起頭來，投着羨慕的目光。那飛舞的蜜蜂，彷彿是吐絲的蠶繭，它在辛勤地爲人們織着禦寒品哩。</p>
<p>『今年的絨綫也貴得買不起了！』</p>
<p>在人叢中，是誰發出了那樣沉重的歎息：「貴得買不起了」如箭似的貫穿着每個人的心胸—從米價每担四十元的重荷下剛鬆過一口氣來的時候，叉得爲「在秋風里」的全家愁急着度過冬天的衣服了。</p>
<p>在霓紅燈光照射着的另一面，是一長列整潔的玻璃窓柵，裹面陳列着更眩人目光的物品：是一頭浸在藥水中的乳鹿；是兩枝美麗的鹿角；是裝在錦盒中的參枝：是……總之，是「補品」。</p>
<p>是的，在一般人愁急着「禦寒乏術」的時候，也有人感到是應該「及時進補」了。</p>
<p>終歲辛勞，爲衣食奔走的人們，果然米漲到四十元一担而感到生活的恐慌；絨錢也貴得買不起了而喟然歎息，可是他們的身體，經過風霜雨雪的鍜練，那玻璃窓中陳列着的精緻的補品，他們並不需要，同時，也不會激起那種奢侈的慾念，希望一嚐異味，因爲他們已經有着堅强的體格。</p>
<p>然而那些像鮮花一樣供奉在暖房中的高貴的人們呢？他們生長在不潔的空氣中，他們的享受，也正相反地在剝奪他們的健康，於是在感到身體脆弱的時候，他們想憑藉着「補品」來彌補。可不知道「藥補不如食補」，醫生指示病人的攝生之道也是：運動，呼吸新鮮空氣，多吃富於滋養的食物。所以進補不是一種「享受」，而是「醫病」。可是有誰能够注意到他們病根的潛伏期於先？反沉於聲色犬馬之好，而加速着自己身體的衰亡。—這時候「補品」或許已經失却了它的效力了。、</p>
<p>同樣，耍鍛練健全的精神，也要如鍜練健全的體格一樣，宜注意病根潛伏期於先，務「醫病」於後。本市工商敎育慈善各團體「鑒於世風日下，廉恥道喪，甚至社會上素有地位聲望之士，亦竟不顧廉恥，而爲權利所熱中，靦顏事仇」而發起崇尚廉恥運動。所謂「爲權利所熱中」，正如供奉在暖房中的人們為「享受」所欺騙一樣，以致身體脆弱，需要及時進補。崇尚廉恥運動所定的（一）自已立誓，不與聞無恥的事業，不受無恥的金錢；（二）共同對無恥之徒，口誅筆伐，母稍徇情。正是病根潛伏期的對症下藥。　（黃自强）</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠思擴村治託兒有所</p>
<p>這就因爲他開辦得早，早知道將來各處都要有這種需求，而他那裏已早有預備了，這便是朱村長所說的投機事業了。雖然如此，單靠投機，也不中用，脾子也很有關係。因爲自由村所供應的苗本，選擇旣精，他是請了專門家硏究考察過的，還撰了許多說明盡，的確與衆不同。到後來，各地來要的一天天的多，他們所辦的苗圃，也一天天的廣。好在這苗圃是惟陳出新，送出一大批種好的，又加添一大批新種的，把所有山地，全成了苗圃。這個風氣一開，自中村的村民，牆陰一尺之區，籬畔三弓之地，也不讓它有個空隙，必定想法子要種幾枝樹苗咧。一個小學生，在他的屋後柳陰之下，圍着個小竹籬，放學歸來，也要拉着他的小同學，去看看他所種的樹啦。還些苗圃，是自由村較大一筆收入，朱村長對於它，覺得很有興趣。現在有許多名貴的樹苗，從國外搜羅得來的，他們也在試種呢。除了苗圃之外，幾個村營的集體農塲，出產也不少。他們還有村營的集體養暨塲，村營的運輸公司，村營的公共汽車。總之，一年的收入，也很寬裕。倘然有什麽特別的支出，他們還可以借村債，也有人特別捐助給村中的。不過朱村長和本村主持的人，他們都是量入爲出。可以緩辦的地方，他們寗可暫時緩辦，他們是相信用循序漸進的法子的。只要基礎旣立，不怕這個自由村將來不發達。可是像敎育衛生的幾件事，朱村長和他們幾位，却是時刻在心，不能忽略。所以今天和愛人商量到託兒所的事。江浙兩省的鄉鎭間，有幾處已經辦了託兒所了，自由村也從前提議過。自由村雖然不能像安樂鎭那樣的有個規摸很好的育嬰院，一個託兒所，似乎是必不可少的。有了一個，便可以推廣到有幾個，這是我們下代的事，便是所謂未來的主人翁。下一代，他們做些什麽事業？進步到什麼程度？我們此刻完全不知道，但我們必須給他們預備一切，這是我們做上一代的義務。我們也曾經受了上一代的恩惠，我們就把來報答我們的下一代，世界就這樣的繼續相承下去了。正是：</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>崑劇無沒落之理</h3>
<p>— 畸人</p>
<p>事在人為，願愛好者一致奮起！</p>
<p>崑劇是中國戲的鼻祖，也是發育最早的一種劇藝，它有極好的劇本，極好的音樂和極細膩的表情；思前想後，無論如何是不應該沒落的！眞如太陽決不會從西天出來一樣！</p>
<p>然而何以現在竟如此一蹶不振呢？這理由很簡單，就是「人力未盡」四個字，去年我在本刊紅白齋劇談裹已經很透澈地講過了·不競則減，乃天演之公理，幾曾見世界上有不奮鬥而成功的人？無論是希特勒，蕭伯納，甚至卓別麟，梅蘭芳，那個不曾下過一番苦工夫</p>
<p>崑劇初以廳堂戲劇的姿態問世，歷史至少也有二百年以上了，然而這中問，可以乾乾脆脆的說一句，簡直是始終沒有人改進過，眞所謂一味的閉門自守，能够勉强苟延到目前，還是天大的徼倖咧！</p>
<p>「復興崑劇」，這問題在我腦海裏，足足盤旋了五個多年頭，一有工夫，便埋下頭寫計劃，隨時還跟各方有關係的人硏究請敎，到現在我可以大胆的說一句在話，如果我的計劃能够實行，那末崑劇的復興，不無一助。</p>
<p>因爲素來反對「紙上談兵」，而且痛恨「秀才造反，三年不成」，所以這裏不願再多說了。（免得又引起許多無謂的論爭）至於我寫這篇文字的動機，實在是誠心誠意的想找尋幾位願意合作的人，（注意，合作的範圍，是實實在在的做，不是開座談會開辯論會）如其有愛好崑劇而又擁有相當資力的同志，只要寫一封信給我，（交本刊編輯部轉）我一定馬上會登門拜訪的。</p>
<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>中國初期的武俠明星　改良文明戲的范雪朋</h3>
<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>拋棄了水銀燈生活的范雪朋，現在是「綠寳劇塲」的紅人了。</p>
<p>十三年以前，正是武俠影片的「黃金時代」，范小姐在「友聯」的「十三妹」裹完成了她的處女作，從此在中國初期的銀壇上，范雪朋的名字便爲任何人所熟悉了。</p>
<p>可是，漸漸地，由「友聯」到「天一」，這位「武俠明星」畢竟改變了她的作風，也就是說，她給導演們發掘了演悲劇的天財，於是「紉珠」使她重復引起了銀壇的注意。</p>
<p>八一三以前，她是藝華公司的基本演員，「掌上珠一是一張有名的倫理片，而范雪朋便是以把握劇中人物性格最成功的一個，可是，從那時候起，戰爭使她跳出了影圈，「掌上珠」也是她最後的作品了一關於她的偶姦生涯，浚早還是開始於「大華劇團」，在　無爲的主持下，她飾關秀姑一角，在「啼笑姻緣」裏面，曾風靡了千萬觀衆，北平，天津，漢口，長沙，上海，消磨了足有一年。</p>
<p>她在「友聯」得到丈夫文逸民的助力不少，戰後，曾一度演出於大中華話劇塲，三個月之後給「綠寳」聘去，到現在，已經一年多。</p>
<p>現在，她獲得顧夢鶴，陳秋風，田心等的「改良文明戲」志趣的伙伴們，她沉重地說。</p>
<p>「我是足跡半中國，我明白戲劇祇是敎育的一環，看到了內地各縣市觀衆的程度，我眞要嘆息那些專以標榜「口號」的戲劇工作者，僅孤行於爭取「已經受過敎育」的極少數的「大衆」，因此，我就毅然跳上舞臺了。</p>

<p>他家中人口很簡單。夫人福芝芳女士外，三子一女而巳。長子名葆琛，十五歲。决葆珍，十三。三女葆玥，十歲。最幼者名葆玖，六歲。四人皆已進校讀書。課餘在家，更聘有中英文敎師補習。梅先生對他們的學業，督促非常嚴厲！四人天資都不壞。看他們的性情與志向，長子願當飛機師或習機械工程。决子識事理，胸有成竹，不習律則習醫。三女溫婉，近於文學。幼子則聰慧逾常兒，容貌酷肯乃父，將來能繼續梅先生衣鉢者，必係此子也。他雖然年齡幼小，最喜歡音樂。在四五歲的時候，有幾十張唱片放在一起，他便能分得出，這是誰的唱片與唱的是什麼戲。留音機一響，他便能知道是什麼戲，是誰唱的。同是一張起解的唱片，音樂的不同，他能够辨別得出，眞是奇事！天賦如此之厚，能早加以銀鍊，不出十年，必有一日「滿城爭說小蘭芳」也。</p>
<p>梅夫人福女士，人很煦和大方，嬪吾師後，聘師課讀，論孟古文，皆會畢卷。日前偶談及南通張嗇公拒不開昭關壩的往事，（後來下游豐收，嗇公曾捐下游之米，以濟上游）。夫人曰：此所謂「河內凶，則移其民於河東，移其粟於河內，河東凶亦然」也。用典恰合。她的出言吐屬，可見一斑。邇來益善持家，倘能以餘暇，再追尋追尋典籍中的快樂，也確是消遣之一法也。梅夫人有一位老太太，也住在梅先生家中。此外則女僕兩三人，男僕四五人而已！並不像外人所傳，養着許多保鏢的。梅先生與人旣無迕，論資產，尚不逮中人，外表看來，猶如加立克香煙的盆子，裹面却裝的是前門牌香煙，可謂「羊質虎皮」。在上海的富翁中，眞抵不到太倉之一稊。所以事實上也無防範之必要。不過他因爲常出門述行，途中照料需人，所以家中用的幾個人，大都是燕趙間的豪士。個個孔武有力，允善射擊。不過旣進了梅家之後，池就英雄無用武之地了。</p>

<h3>German Land, Sea, and Air Forces Intensify Attacks on England and France. German Troops Briefly Invade France on the Western Front Before Being Repelled. German Planes Bomb Scottish Naval Port, Air Battles Ensue.</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: A correspondent for the National Daily News stationed in Berlin reports that Hitler has abandoned hope of acting as a mediator between neutral countries and has issued final orders for a large-scale offensive. Hitler held a long meeting with naval and air force leaders on Sunday. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 85, stating, "Under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy launched an attack this morning on a six-kilometer front east of the Moselle River. They immediately occupied the high ground of Hinsberg, where our forces had only deployed a small number of scouts and laid some landmines, so they were unable to stop the enemy. The enemy then briefly invaded the village of Apach on our border, but after being heavily shelled by our artillery, they hurriedly retreated north of the village." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 86, stating, "Yesterday afternoon, the enemy launched a second determined offensive on a thirty-kilometer front east of the Saar River, again using artillery cover. Our forward outposts withdrew in good order after completing their mission. The purpose of our troops' previous incursions into German territory was to indirectly aid the Polish army. Our General Headquarters, anticipating a German offensive, had redeployed these troops to other positions two weeks ago, leaving only forward outposts to scout enemy movements." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: A semi-official source commented on the current situation of the French and German armies today, stating that, as expected yesterday, the Germans dispatched a large contingent of infantry this morning, under the cover of artillery fire, to launch a relatively large-scale offensive on a six-kilometer front east of the Moselle River. This differs from the previous situation where only small units were operating sporadically. The enemy had probed this area from the first day of the war and briefly invaded French territory, but our forces immediately repelled them and counterattacked to the village of Berus in the German Saar region. Later, two weeks ago, we occupied a small forest in that area. Since then, both sides have sent scouting parties to patrol and exchange artillery fire, with no other activity. However, in recent days, the enemy has suddenly become very active in that area and has attempted to capture our soldiers to gather military intelligence. Our General Headquarters knew that the enemy was preparing to attack and withdrew some forward outposts in advance. Therefore, the enemy's attack today was within our expectations. The Hinsberg heights that the enemy occupied are the site of the outposts that we had previously abandoned. The village of Apach, which the enemy briefly invaded, is located on the border between the two countries, on the road from Thionville to Trier. After the enemy reached the village, they were subjected to intense artillery fire from our forces and retreated in disarray. The exact number of enemy troops involved in today's attack and the specific units to which they belong are not yet confirmed. It is also difficult to say whether this offensive is of a local nature or whether they are preparing to launch similar offensives along the entire line. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: It is reported that British troops have entered the Maginot Line, preparing to meet the enemy. Hitler is currently concentrating his elite troops, planning a large-scale offensive. The strongest concentration of forces is on a 65-mile to 75-mile front between the Moselle River and the Hardt Forest. Yesterday, the German artillery did not fire a single shot throughout the day, as if fearing to reveal the location of the artillery and provoke a counterattack from the Allied forces. According to sources here, Hitler may take a gamble, using all of Germany's strength, regardless of the cost, to break through the Maginot Line. Based on the German strategy in the past, the German offensive will likely be launched along the entire Rhine and Moselle Rivers. Initially, large numbers of tanks will exert pressure on two or three key points along the plains, supported by fighter planes flying low and firing machine guns, followed by bombers, so that French planes cannot counterattack the German bombers. However, the French army has made various preparations for this strategy. Therefore, if the German tanks want to advance, they must pass through mined areas and areas under artillery fire. German planes will also encounter extremely intense artillery fire. If the German army launches an attack on the Rhine front, 30,000 British soldiers with modern equipment and excellent training will inflict heavy damage. These troops are currently helping to defend the elaborately constructed Maginot Line, preventing any enemy from breaking through. These 30,000 British soldiers are the vanguard that the German army will encounter. Soon, the 32nd British Division will participate in the war in France. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German military announced this afternoon that most of the French troops who occupied German territory yesterday have withdrawn. Two British warships were hit by heavy bombs from German planes and suffered significant damage. Yesterday, enemy planes invaded German airspace and five were shot down, two of which were British. In the past week, enemy merchant ships in the North Sea and Baltic Sea have been repeatedly threatened and attacked by German forces. Between the 13th and 15th of this month, several ships in the Atlantic Ocean were sunk by German submarines, with a total tonnage of 54,396 tons. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Twelve to fourteen German planes attacked the Firth of Forth this afternoon. Two were shot down in eastern Scotland. A third was shot down into the sea in the Firth of Tay during a battle with British fighters. British ships did not suffer major damage. Only one bomb grazed the cruiser HMS Southampton, causing minor damage to the bow. The admiral's flagship and a small boat were sunk. Three crew members of the Southampton and seven crew members of the 10,000-ton cruiser HMS Edinburgh were wounded by shrapnel. One bomb fell near the destroyer HMS Mohawk, causing 25 casualties. At 2:35 PM, British planes first engaged German planes outside the Isle of May at the entrance to the Firth of Forth. One German plane was forced down to within a few feet of the sea surface before escaping. Ten minutes later, another German plane caught fire and crashed into the sea during a battle in the sky over Dalkeith. Within fifteen minutes, fierce fighting broke out in the Firth of Clyde, and a second German plane crashed into the sea. A third German plane was shot down while being pursued. The British Air Force suffered no casualties. A train crossing the Forth Bridge seemed to be one of the German planes' targets. Passengers on the train gave the most detailed eyewitness accounts of the air raid. They saw German planes fly low and drop bombs, many of which landed in the river, causing the river water to splash up. After the German planes appeared, anti-aircraft guns around Edinburgh immediately opened fire into the sky until the German planes were driven away. The weather was clear, and the explosions of the shells in the high altitude were clearly visible. Of the German planes that were shot down, the four pilots of one plane drowned, one was shot dead, and the fourth was wounded in the arm. The three pilots of a German plane that crashed in the Pentland Hills have been captured. Before the air raid, several German planes had flown over Rosyth to scout. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London: According to official reports, two naval officers and thirteen sailors were killed and twelve seriously injured when German planes bombed British ships in the Firth of Forth yesterday. One civilian was injured by stray machine-gun fire. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Of the dozen or so German planes that attacked the Firth of Forth yesterday, three more have now been found to have been shot down in the areas of Kincardine, Aberdour, and Queensferry. It appears that a total of seven German planes were shot down. In addition, many people claim that an eighth plane caught fire and crashed on the hillside south of the Firth of Forth. Officials are currently searching for it. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Officials here announced last night that between 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM this afternoon, multiple German bombers flew to the Firth of Forth to bomb British warships. As a result, two British cruisers were hit by heavy bombs. At the time, British anti-aircraft guns fired intensely, and a large number of destroyers were dispatched. As a result of the air battle, two British destroyers were shot down. Two German planes are also missing. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that four German planes attacked Scapa Flow today. Two bombs landed near the British cruiser HMS Iron Duke, causing slight damage, but there were no casualties. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Announces Success in Destroying German Submarines. One-Third of Sixty Have Been Destroyed. Reports on the Sinking of HMS Royal Oak.</h3>
<p>London: First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill announced in the House of Commons today regarding the sinking of the battleship HMS Royal Oak, stating that the Admiralty believes that of the sixty German submarines that were prepared for battle at the beginning of the war, one-third have now been sunk or severely damaged. On October 13th alone, no fewer than four German submarines were sunk. German submarines have been targeting neutral shipping for two weeks. Near the end of last week, submarine warfare intensified again. On Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, four ships were sunk at the western entrance, two of which belonged to France. Three other ships were attacked but managed to escape. A total of 13,000 tons of British ships have been sunk, but it should not be assumed that all losses are on the British side. The Admiralty has so far not released the figures for the number of German submarines sunk. The attacks are being carried out vigorously and are now being intensified. For example, on Friday of last week, four German submarines were destroyed, including two of the largest and most modern ocean-going submarines in the German Navy. Such results have never been achieved in a single day during the last Great War. I can release figures for the results of last week. This is the end of the sixth week since the start of the war. A total of seven German submarines were sunk this week. We can estimate that in these six weeks, a total of thirteen German submarines have been sunk, and another five have been severely damaged or have already sunk. Several others have suffered minor damage. These figures are likely underestimations. In addition, two-thirds of the German submarines that have been deployed have been attacked with depth charges. The French Navy is also very active and has been successful. Therefore, we believe that of the sixty German submarines that were prepared for battle at the beginning of the war, one-third have been sunk or severely damaged. This accounts for at least one-fifth of the total number of the largest and most modern ocean-going submarines. Therefore, one-third to one-quarter of the German submarine fleet has been destroyed, and the loss of officers and men cannot be quickly replaced. As for British merchant shipping, a total of 21 million tons are sailing, of which 156,000 tons have been sunk by submarines. Another 18,000 tons have been lost due to mines and other accidents, totaling 174,000 tons. During the same period, we captured 29,000 tons of German ships. From this perspective, our merchant shipping has not been significantly affected by submarine warfare, while the enemy has suffered enormous losses. If this continues, the enemy will find it difficult to sustain these losses. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London: First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons today that the battleship HMS Royal Oak was sunk by a German submarine at 1:30 AM on Saturday while berthed at Scapa Flow. It is incomprehensible how the submarine was able to penetrate the defenses of the harbor. During the last Great War, the area was never attacked by submarines. We must recognize this enemy submarine's infiltration as a skillful and daring act. At the time, it appears that the enemy submarine fired torpedoes at the ship. One of them hit the bow, and twenty minutes later, the enemy submarine fired three or four more torpedoes in succession, hitting the ship, causing it to capsize. The ship was berthed at the end of the harbor, so many officers and men could not be rescued and drowned. The list of survivors has now been released. In total, the number of officers and men who died is estimated to be over eight hundred. Churchill continued, "The Admiralty immediately announced the sinking of this good ship. This loss is significant, but it does not affect the large reserve of heavy ships' security. German submarines are searching extensively for the mooring place, but have not achieved any results. However, the port will be able to be declared clear after some time, as any German submarines that do not surface for air will be heading for their doom. The authorities are now taking various measures to increase security, which had been effective during the last Great War." Churchill also answered a question from a Member of Parliament, stating that the booms and defenses of Scapa Flow were recently deployed and are not from the last Great War. An investigation is currently underway, and once it is completed, he will be able to answer further questions. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Minister for Co-ordination of Defence Lord Chatfield reported on the sinking of the battleship HMS Royal Oak in the House of Lords this afternoon, stating, "This ship was berthed at Scapa Flow in Scotland and was sunk by a German submarine at 1:30 AM on the 14th of this month. The submarine first fired two torpedoes, one of which hit the ship's hull. Twenty minutes later, it fired three or four more torpedoes, and the ship was sunk. A total of over eight hundred officers and men died. Although this loss is significant, our country possesses many large warships, and the level of security remains extremely sufficient. The naval authorities have been actively searching for enemy submarines in the area where warships are moored in Scapa Flow, but so far, there have been no results. It is expected that the area can be declared safe after some time. In addition, the naval authorities have taken the necessary defense measures, following the methods of the last European War, to ensure safety." Lord Chatfield then reported on the German air raid on the Firth of Forth yesterday, stating, "A total of twelve or more German planes, divided into several groups of two or three planes each, took turns bombing. One British civilian was hit by shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells and suffered minor injuries. The damage to civilian property was also very minor. A total of four German planes were shot down, and several others may not have been able to return to base, which I firmly believe. Three of our naval officers and thirteen sailors have died, and eleven sailors have been seriously injured, while fifty-one sailors have been slightly injured. The damage to the cruisers HMS Southampton and HMS Edinburgh and the destroyer HMS Mohawk was very minor. Up until this morning, four German planes flew to Scapa Flow again to bomb. At the time, two bombs landed near the battleship HMS Iron Duke, causing slight damage to the ship. One enemy plane was shot down, and another was also damaged." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Commander of German Submarines Promoted to Rear Admiral</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Naval Commander-in-Chief Raeder awarded the Iron Cross to officers and crew members of submarines for their outstanding achievements at Scapa Flow today, as a reward. The submarine had fired mines that destroyed the British battleship HMS Royal Oak and the cruiser HMS Repulse. It is also reported that Führer Hitler has issued an order promoting the commander of German submarines, Dönitz, to Rear Admiral. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet naval expert Ivanov published an article in Izvestia today, stating that German submarines can make England feel threatened, and England's attempt to blockade Germany cannot achieve significant results. He also said that since the outbreak of the war, German submarines have not only severely impacted England's overseas trade but also inflicted significant losses on the English navy, as evidenced by the sinking of HMS Courageous and HMS Royal Oak by German submarines. As for the English warships not being able to enter the Baltic Sea, Germany's trade with the countries of the North Sea will not be obstructed. At the same time, Italy's maintenance of neutrality and the contiguity of the territories of the Soviet Union and Germany can allow Germany to obtain the raw materials it needs. These are all factors that are beneficial to Germany. Moreover, the German submarines and air force are extraordinarily active and can threaten English maritime shipping. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>London: The thirty-two crew members of the SS Sneaton (3,600 tons), which was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic on Saturday, arrived at a port on the south coast today. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Information Bureau announced that the French postal ship SS Bretagne (10,000 tons) and the cargo ship SS Louisiane (7,000 tons) were sunk by two German submarines in the Atlantic on the 14th of this month. Five crew members and two passengers on the Bretagne are missing, and their fate is unknown. The chief mate of the Louisiane died. At least one of the submarines has been sunk by our warships. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>New York: It is reported that the British cargo ship SS Loch Madoes, which was sunk by a German submarine on the 14th of this month, was carrying 30 boxes of contraband aircraft parts, weighing 200 tons, hidden in a secret part of the ship. This has now been discovered by the German Navy. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>London: A Greek ship was sunk by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean a few days ago. The Danish ship SS Sicilia sailed to rescue them and immediately rescued twenty-seven crew members. These people have landed in England. Seven of them have sustained serious injuries. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Berne, Switzerland: The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports that the German Navy has redeployed a large number of mines in the Baltic Sea, from the south of Falsterbo Island to the west of the German coastal Stral Sund. The intention is to prohibit any ships from entering or exiting the Great Belt and Little Belt Straits. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Reports of Air Raid on Emden, Germany</h3>
<p>Winschoten, Netherlands: According to many residents on the German border, the port of Emden, Germany, was subjected to an air raid at around 11:00 AM today. At that time, several planes were flying at high altitude. The sound of exploding bombs was heard very clearly, and the smoke was visible. The German anti-aircraft guns fired intensely. In addition, artillery fire was heard in the Emden area this morning. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Oslo: Fishermen have reported that a German ship was sunk. It is claimed that on Saturday and Sunday, three British ships and one British plane attacked a German ship off the west coast of Norway. After firing several shots, a plume of black smoke rose from the water. The British ships then sailed away. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Oslo: A violent explosion occurred west of the Oxøy lighthouse today. It is believed that an oil tanker exploded and caught fire. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Air Raid Alarms Sound Throughout England</h3>
<p>London: According to official announcements today, a plane of unknown nationality appeared near Hull and Grimsby this morning. The authorities immediately took precautionary measures and issued an air raid alarm at 11:00 AM. However, as no German planes were seen, the alarm was lifted 50 minutes later. Air raid alarms were also issued in Blyth. Thousands of people rushed to air-raid shelters, and traffic on the streets came to a standstill, but there was no panic. The mouth of the Firth of Forth also sounded the alarm at 11:12 AM and lifted it at 11:30 AM. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Flies Reconnaissance Missions Over Germany</h3>
<p>London: The Air Ministry announced that several British planes flew reconnaissance missions over western and northwestern Germany yesterday. All except one plane, which is missing, have returned safely to their base. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germans Claim to Have Shot Down British and French Planes</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced yesterday that a British bomber was shot down by German anti-aircraft guns near Grosskrotzenburg. One British pilot was killed, and the other three were captured. Yesterday morning, a French reconnaissance plane was shot down by the Germans near Zehmens. One French pilot was killed, and the other two were injured and sent to a hospital for treatment. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>English Emphasis:</h3>
<h3>The British Emphasize Poland's Strategic Position: German Offensive Suffers Heavy Losses; Polish Forces in Occupied Areas Continue to Resist</h3>
<p>London – The Polish Embassy in London recently issued a public statement saying that German newspapers have recently published reports of German troops in occupied Poland being repeatedly attacked by "armed bandits." Upon investigation, the German side's claims of "armed bandits" are entirely malicious slander. In reality, they are regular Polish army units continuing to strongly resist German and Soviet troops within the occupied areas. According to reliable sources, Polish army units are currently fighting German troops in the south near the Carpathian Mountains and in the north near the Suwałki region. Other units are continuing to resist the Red Army in the Białowieża Forest area in the west. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London – The Information Department recently issued a public statement, stating that German propaganda organs have repeatedly spread messages intended to create the impression that Poland was sacrificed for the sake of the Allied nations of Britain and France, and that despite the Polish army's efforts to resist, it was of no benefit to those countries. All these claims are untrue. In reality, Britain and France will rely heavily on Polish assistance to achieve final victory in the future, as can be clearly seen from the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The number of German casualties in Poland is certainly higher than that announced by Hitler himself. In his report to the House of Commons on the 6th of this month, he stated that the German army had 10,572 killed, 30,000 wounded, and 3,000 missing. In reality, the total number is likely around 150,000. This estimate is not an exaggeration. Given that the decisive battle is likely to be prolonged, such heavy casualties in the early stages of the German offensive cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>(2) German military equipment losses are quite significant. Regarding tanks, it is said that 83 were lost in a certain offensive. Later, in a counter-offensive near Lviv in southern Poland on September 16th, General Sosnkowski reportedly destroyed another 100. As for the air force, German losses are also considerable, and fuel consumption is undoubtedly huge.</p>
<p>(3) The 70 divisions of German troops on the Eastern Front have been constrained by the Polish army, preventing them from being transferred to the Western Front, thus allowing France to complete its mobilization work at its leisure.</p>
<p>(4) Because of the need to cope with the Eastern Front, the German army had to concentrate a large air force in Poland, allowing the British army to safely cross the English Channel and land in France.</p>
<p>(5) The British and French armies have been able to fully understand how the German army uses its air force, tanks, and motorized units by observing the situation on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>(6) During the fighting on the Eastern Front, the Polish army's lines were not particularly strong, but German infantry units were still unable to advance without tank cover. The German army, knowing that the French Maginot Line is far stronger, must already have a deep impression of fighting on the Western Front. Moreover, although Poland's anti-tank artillery force is not very large, it can still inflict heavy damage on German tanks. Therefore, when German tank units operate on the Western Front, all drivers will inevitably be apprehensive about the far greater power of French anti-tank artillery.</p>
<p>(7) The Polish army's steadfast defense of Warsaw and Modlin Fortress has won the admiration of the world. The British and French armies have been deeply stimulated and their fighting spirit has been further inspired. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese news agency Domei, communicating via Hong Kong telegraph, created an atmosphere suggesting that the Chinese Nationalist Government was seeking peace negotiations with Japan. Such statements, without any corroborating evidence, are considered rumors. Rumors that are disproven are considered fabrications. In this case, both corroborating and disproving evidence are lacking, so Domei's telegraph lies somewhere between rumor and hearsay. Rumors and hearsay are not suitable subjects for commentary. However, international relations dictate that war must eventually be followed by peace. Therefore, even if the Nationalist Government's seeking peace is a fabrication today, the issue of peace negotiations will eventually become a reality. The Sino-Japanese conflict involves a wide range of issues, so the ending of the Sino-Japanese War is an integral part of solving world problems. Because of this, Chinese or Japanese, British, French, German, Italian, Soviet, or American people, in short, no one can ignore this rumor or hearsay. Furthermore, according to a recent dispatch from Chongqing, British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, was received by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and had a lengthy conversation after arriving in Chongqing. Since the matter was not public, outsiders cannot know the content of the discussion. To claim knowledge would be absurd. However, it provides ample new material for rumors or hearsay.</p>
<p>To go to war from a state of peace, and to seek peace from a state of war, is a major national issue. On this major issue, people may not all share the same ideas, but their actions must not be disjointed but must maintain a united national front to preserve the nation. For example, a month after Britain declared war on Germany, the opposition politician Lloyd George advocated for not hastily closing the door to negotiations. His words were gentle, but his meaning was clear. However, he only went as far as "each expressing their own opinion" and never abruptly abandoned Chamberlain to befriend Hitler. This was not because Lloyd George lacked confidence or strength, but because no national issue is greater than war and peace. It is not the same in China. From beginning to end, China has never had the choice of whether to fight or not, whether to resist or not. Forced by a powerful enemy's deep invasion, self-defense and survival are the only options, and resistance is the only path. Therefore, there is no turning back from going to war. Even now, foreign aggression persists, and the danger remains. In short, as long as the state of aggression is not resolved and individual freedom is not guaranteed, there is no choice between making peace or not, negotiating or not. The issue is not war or peace, but simply choosing between survival and annihilation. Therefore, war and peace are major issues for general nations, but not for China. To say that it is an issue, originating from Chongqing, is either a childish insult from the other party or a self-declaration of their own wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Judging from the fundamental nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the problem does not lie with both China and Japan, but solely with Japan. Moreover, the problem on the Japanese side is whether to continue the aggression or abandon it. Continuing the aggression inevitably leads to war, while abandoning the aggression will naturally lead to peace. Therefore, the essence of the problem is not so-called war or peace. Examining the facts, the problem is not even this. In reality, it is impossible for Japan to continue its aggression, but it is unwilling to abandon it. From this, we can understand what Japan is scheming, planning, agonizing over, and striving for in every possible way: to achieve its aggressive ambitions without war. Even if it cannot achieve all of its aggressive ambitions, it seeks to end the war at the current stage and not fight again, to reap the full benefits of its aggression at the current stage. Observe their actions: First, make the military firmly defend the points and lines they have invaded and occupied. In the future, military operations will not focus on advancing forward, but will instead be eager to "sweep away" the military and civilian forces in the occupied areas of China, turning points and lines into planes. Second, make entrepreneurs, financiers, and industrial, commercial, shipping operators compete to be the first, excluding other countries, seeking immediate profits in the near term and building a solid foundation in the long term, gaining tangible benefits under their control, turning the occupied areas from planes into three-dimensional entities. Third, political operatives, under the secret of using Chinese to control Chinese, support tools and use knives to kill, acting as outposts and tentacles for their military and economic aggression, and when things are quiet, cleaning the courtyards and patrolling the granaries. Fourth, make scholars and literati talk about benevolence and righteousness, gloss over mistakes, and engage in flowery rhetoric, attracting people to take the bait, signing unfulfilled promises with irresponsible identities, using the trick of anesthetization to achieve the grand effect of attacking the mind. Whether these four aspects achieve success is another matter. However, the various tactics used by Japan today cannot be hidden from the world's eyes and ears.</p>
<p>The difference between sincerity and falsehood may only be a hair's breadth. How can we be sure that Japan will never abandon its aggression and has no sincerity to repent? Their officials and people, with parched lips and weary tongues, bow deeply. Can we simply dismiss them as hypocritical? This is where we can find disproving evidence: All the peace movements and peace theories that the Japanese side has created are massively exported to the occupied areas of China. However, great principles such as stopping the war, negotiating peace on equal terms, correcting past mistakes, and promoting the spirit of mutual respect have never been marketed in their own three islands. Why is this? If this disproving evidence is insufficient, then we must await factual actions to prove the abandonment of aggression. But where can we find clear evidence of factual actions?</p>
<h3>Hitler Dispatches Special Envoy to Moscow to Seek Aid: Carries Handwritten Letter to Stalin; Hitler Also Speaks with Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>London – The Daily Mail recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in the capital of the Netherlands, stating that, according to reliable sources in Berlin, the German government sent a special envoy to Moscow last night. The person is said to be Gabriel, a senior official from the Ministry of Economics. He is carrying a letter from Hitler himself to Stalin, requesting that the Soviet government fulfill its promises and come to Germany's aid. The Soviet side is said to have expressed its willingness to provide assistance and recognize Hungary and Yugoslavia as within Germany's sphere of influence, but only on the condition that Germany recognize Finland, Sweden, Norway, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey as within the Soviet sphere of influence and allow the Soviet Union to act freely. In addition, Italy was not mentioned at all. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the "Telegraaf," Hitler sent a special envoy with a personal letter to Stalin in Moscow yesterday and is currently eagerly awaiting Stalin's reply. It is also said that Hitler is also communicating with Rome by telephone and has sent an envoy for consultation. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – The Dagens Nyheter recently published a message from Berlin stating that German Chancellor Hitler convened an important military conference yesterday and afterwards sent special envoys to Moscow and Rome for consultations. It is said that he is requesting Soviet assistance in exchange for allowing the Soviet Union to act freely in Scandinavia. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – The Berlin correspondent of the "Telegraaf" reports that the content of the German-Italian talks is confusing and difficult to grasp. Mussolini's strong opposition to cooperating with the Soviet Union to confront the Western democracies seems to be a constant and unwavering principle. Italy had already made significant sacrifices fighting against the communists in Spain and finds it difficult to tolerate opening the Mediterranean to the Soviet Union. Although Rome does not oppose the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, it strongly opposes active cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, even if Germany has made significant concessions to the Soviet Union. The correspondent also stated that it is currently difficult to predict the outcome of the German-Italian talks, but judging from the large number of German troops currently being transferred to the Western Front, Germany does not seem willing to provide military assistance to the Soviet Union.

<h3>German Delegation Arrives in Moscow to Discuss Repatriation Issue</h3>

Political circles here believe that the relocation will be completed in early winter. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>London – Italian Ambassador to the UK, Bastianini, formally visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this afternoon after assuming his post. According to diplomatic circles, this is more than just a routine introductory visit. Ambassador Bastianini must have brought detailed instructions, and the attitude of Italy towards the current situation should be clear after the talks. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Trade Agreement Established Between Germany and Yugoslavia: Yugoslavia Exchanges Raw Materials for German Military Supplies; Italy and Yugoslavia Also Conduct Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>Belgrade – It is learned that Germany has signed a protocol with Yugoslavia to replace the original trade agreement, with a validity period of six months. According to the original agreement, Yugoslavia was to supply Germany with 30,000 carloads of wheat, which has now been reduced to 10,000 carloads. The original agreement to supply 20,000 carloads of corn has now been changed to 45,000 tons of vegetable oil. The quantity of timber that Yugoslavia should supply remains the same, but when Germany needs it, Yugoslavia should exchange minerals and various other raw materials and agricultural products for German military equipment. In addition, Yugoslavia should export 300,000 pigs to Germany each year in exchange for German military supplies of equal value. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – An Italian trade delegation, led by Dr. Mazzi, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Finance, arrived here yesterday to conduct talks with the Yugoslav Ministry of Commerce on the development of bilateral trade. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Many Differences Remain in Soviet-Turkish Mutual Assistance Pact: Turkish Foreign Minister Returns Home with Soviet Proposals; Negotiations Between the Two Countries Will Continue</h3>
<p>Moscow – Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu is scheduled to return to his country tonight without signing any agreement with the Soviet government. Although the Turkish side stated that both sides have made suggestions that need to be studied at length, the fact is that Saraçoğlu's return is to report the situation of the negotiations to the government, but the negotiations have stopped and many differences remain. Furthermore, the Turkish economic delegation, led by Agriculture Minister Ekrem, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow to visit the agricultural exhibition. Saraçoğlu's departure before their arrival is noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu departed from here for Ankara tonight without signing any agreement with the authorities here. According to authoritative Soviet sources, this is a good sign, not only does it not indicate a breakdown in negotiations, but it also indicates that the negotiations are nearing success. Therefore, according to observations from authoritative sources here, a Soviet-Turkish mutual assistance treaty may soon be concluded quickly. It is said that the Turkish Foreign Minister returned home with concrete Soviet proposals for the Turkish government to discuss. At the same time, after the departure of the Turkish Foreign Minister, the Turkish Minister of Agriculture and four other representatives who will arrive will continue negotiations with the Soviet government. (Associated Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu visited Foreign Minister Molotov at the Kremlin this afternoon for two hours. The content of the meeting is unknown to outsiders. The agreement between the Soviet Union and Turkey was originally scheduled to be signed at the end of last week, but this did not materialize. The reason for this is unknown to diplomatic circles. However, some speculate that both sides wanted to resolve certain issues related to the Balkans first. In addition, according to a message from the capital of Turkey from an American news agency, Turkey has rejected various demands made by the Soviet Union and notified the Soviet Union of two points: (1) If Italy joins the war, Turkey will assist Britain and France; (2) Turkey cannot accept the formation of a group of Balkan countries controlled by Germany and the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles here believe that this news is exaggerated. In fact, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey have probably not progressed to this stage. However, one thing can be asserted: judging from the delay in these negotiations, it can be seen that Turkey is resisting certain Soviet demands with patience and determination. In short, Turkey has consistently adhered to its obligations to Britain and France in these negotiations, which has been praised by the people of those countries, and it is said that the rumor of a joint German-Soviet control of the Balkans does not correspond to the facts, as Germany has already voluntarily retreated in this respect and allowed the Soviet Union to act freely. In any case, there is no doubt that Turkey does not want to be a second-class country in the Balkans. It is speculated that the Soviet Union and Turkey have probably agreed to shelve the issue of Turkey's recognition of the German-Soviet division of Poland and the issue of Romania's Bessarabia province (which belonged to the Soviet Union before the European War). Judging from the fact that the Turkish economic delegation is coming to Moscow as originally planned, it can be seen that relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are still very harmonious, and various rumors should not be lightly believed.

<h3>Blockade of Tianjin Concession Remains Indefinite</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to Japanese sources from Tianjin, the Japanese side will not remove the blockade of Tianjin unless their objectives are achieved. This is the firm determination of the local Japanese military authorities. Rumors in Tianjin state that the British authorities are about to hand over the silver reserves in the British Concession and will accept the parity exchange of legal tender by the Federal Reserve banknotes. These rumors have arisen because of the recent improvement in major British-Japanese relations after the extradition of the suspects in the assassination of Cheng. However, the Japanese authorities believe that these rumors are the result of a "cunning attempt by the British side to support and maintain the value of the legal tender."

<h3>Chen Cheng Discusses Reasons for Northern Hunan Victory: Japanese Rear Lines of Communication Cut Off, Unable to Concentrate Forces on a Single Point</h3>
<p>Nanyue, Hunan - According to General Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan-Jiangxi War Zone, in a statement to the Associated Press today, in view of the recent victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan, if the Chinese troops were equipped with the same weaponry as the Japanese troops, the combat effectiveness of the Chinese troops would be exactly the same as that of the Japanese troops. According to General Chen Cheng, the reason for this decisive victory in northern Hunan was that the Japanese highways were thoroughly destroyed in advance, preventing the Japanese artillery and tanks from being fully utilized. At the same time, the Chinese side had sufficient time to cut off the Japanese rear lines of communication. As a result, the weaponry of the Chinese and Japanese armies was limited to rifles and machine guns, so the advantages of the Chinese army could be fully demonstrated. At the same time, after the Japanese army entered this dangerous area, it was unable to concentrate its forces to attack a single point, and the Chinese soldiers mostly wore straw sandals, so they could walk freely and without difficulty on the rugged mountain roads. This was also another reason for the victory of the Chinese army. However, he believes that the Japanese side will try to counterattack again, trying to recover the lost territory, in order to save their dignity. According to General Chen, according to unconfirmed reports, the Japanese side has transferred another five divisions to various fronts, mostly from the "Manchukuo" area. The Japanese are now determined to launch an offensive against Changsha in order to dispel the anti-war sentiment in Japan with a new victory and to save their declining prestige. It is expected that the anti-war sentiment in Japan will become increasingly strong in the future, because our victory will become more and more extensive and significant in the future. According to General Chen, on Sunday, 500 Japanese soldiers in Hebucun (transliteration) on the Fengxin Highway were completely wiped out by the Chinese army, and 3,000 Japanese soldiers in Tongcheng are also surrounded by the Chinese army. Tongcheng will be taken soon. The Chinese guerrillas northeast of Yuezhou are now hindering the Japanese army's actions, and he said that when the Japanese army attacked Changsha, the Japanese defense fortifications in Yuezhou had been destroyed by the Chinese guerrillas. General Chen appeared tired when he met with foreign reporters here. It is heard that in these two weeks, General Chen's average sleep time has been no more than two hours per day. According to General Chen, the current strategy adopted by China is to destroy the Japanese lines of communication. When foreign reporters traveled from Hengyang to Nanyue to inspect the situation on the northern Hunan front, they saw that all the places they passed were the richest agricultural areas in China. Except for the farmers carrying small branches as air raid shelters, and some artillery teams heading to the front, there was no sign of war. (Associated Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Circular Orders Stepped-Up Suppression of Opium in Sichuan Province; Private Trade in Opium Absolutely Prohibited; Licenses Previously Issued to Merchants for Opium Procurement Are Abolished</h3>
<p>Chengdu - The investigation and suppression of private opium smuggling in Sichuan Province has been difficult due to the armed protection of smuggling by traitors, bandits, and unscrupulous troops, which has seriously affected the prohibition policy. After the establishment of the Office for the Suppression of Opium Stockpiles, Chairman Chiang, who also serves as the Director of the Office, in order to strictly prevent armed smuggling in various places, plans to station reliable troops in various key areas to implement the prohibition policy. On the 16th, he telegraphed the commissioners and county heads of various districts, stating: "The commissioners and county heads are informed that privately stored opium among the people should be collected by this office at a price in the future.

<h3>The Winter Clothing Donation Drive Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since Madame Chiang, Chairman of the General Association of Chinese Women Comforting Self-Defense and Resistance Soldiers, launched the winter clothing donation drive, unexpected and amazing results have been achieved in less than ten days.

Chen Jiageng in Singapore, in addition to the previously remitted 51,000 yuan, continued to telegraph a remittance of 3,515 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence of British gold, equivalent to 200,000 yuan of national currency. Minister Hu in Switzerland telegraphed that he had remitted 328 US dollars. Madame Ma, Chairman of the Ningxia Province, donated 5,000 yuan alone. The wife of Military Commander Ma Buqing raised 10,000 yuan. The wife of Education Director Chen of the Central Military Academy telegraphed that the officers and students of the school had donated more than 8,400 yuan, equivalent to one day's income per person. As of now, a total of 2,022,400 yuan of national currency, 239 pounds of British gold, and 328 US dollars have been raised.

<h3>U.S. Neutrality Act Amendment Should Take into Account the Overall Situation in the Far East; China Is Actually Fighting for the United States and Will Surely Complete the Great Task of National Reconstruction; Chorus of Justice from Members of Congress</h3>
<p>Washington - The relationship between the Neutrality Act amendment and the Sino-Japanese War was mentioned again in the Senate meeting yesterday. Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Iowa, said, "The 'cash and carry' clause will be a direct blow to China. The relationship between the United States and the Far East is extraordinary, so this fact must be taken into account." Congressional leaders also studied the statement of Kong Xiangxi, Director of the Executive Yuan of China, to Morris, a reporter for the Associated Press, and each person's interpretation was very different. Senator Austin from Vermont told the Associated Press yesterday that the United States must discuss the Sino-Japanese issue and the European issue together, so that the amendment to the Neutrality Act does not discriminate against China. The Senate leaders generally agreed that the United States must wait until the European issue is resolved before paying attention to the Sino-Japanese incident. Senator Minton, a Democrat from Indiana, said that the United States really has no time to take care of the Far East issue at this time. Regarding Kong Xiangxi's suggestion that President Roosevelt should mediate the Sino-Japanese incident, most senators sympathized with the foreign policy of the executive authorities and agreed that if Japan wins in China, it will put the United States in a dangerous position, but they believe that the degree of this danger is greater than the danger to the United States after Hitler wins in Europe. One of the senators privately said, "Looking at the situation from a long-term perspective, China is actually fighting for the United States today, and is doing very well. We can only maintain our consistent attitude of refusing to withdraw from the Far East. Given time, China will surely complete this great task. Our goal today must be to avoid being drawn into the European situation, so that we have time to deal with Japan. The neutrality of the United States is a guarantee to the world. Neither Japan nor Germany can win and control the world." (Associated Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<h3>Pittman Act Automatically Amended, Credit Loan Clause Revoked, Isolationists Criticize Britain and France</h3>
<p>Washington - There are two main points to the Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: one is to abolish the arms embargo clause, and the other is to grant a 90-day credit loan to the belligerent countries. This bill has been debated in the Senate for many days. In order to shorten the debate time as much as possible, Pittman voluntarily revoked the clause "granting a 90-day credit loan to the belligerent countries" today, because this clause has aroused some resentment even among government-affiliated members. Pittman believes that it is better to revoke it directly than to prolong the debate time because of this. Regarding this matter, the opponents cited that the method of granting credit loans to the belligerent countries is in conflict with the Johnson Act (the Johnson Act stipulates that those who have not repaid their war debts to the United States may not obtain new loans from the United States). As a result, the measures implemented by the United States will change from "cash transactions and self-responsible transportation" to "credit transactions and self-responsible transportation." Now that Pittman has automatically revoked the credit loan method, the opposition has lost an important argument. According to Speaker of the House Bankhead, the House of Representatives can pass the Pittman Act after it is amended in this way. Most senators hope that the Senate can submit the bill to a vote by the end of next week. (Havas dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate continued to debate the Neutrality Act amendment today. Senator Gillette, a Democrat, spoke first, saying, "We cannot draft a Neutrality Act that can be applied to all belligerent countries in all circumstances. Even with the current Neutrality Act, its application to the Japanese aggression against China and the German aggression against Poland has been exploited. This unreasonable situation should be corrected urgently. In short, we have no Neutrality Act that can be generally applied to all events and ensure the security and interests of the United States in all circumstances. For this reason, I am prepared to vote in favor of repealing the arms embargo clause, but all transactions that specifically sell arms to a certain belligerent country and all loans that are sufficient to assist the belligerent countries in purchasing arms should be prevented." Senator Shippustead of the Labor Party then spoke, supporting the maintenance of the arms embargo clause. Senator Taft of the Republican Party (who is expected to be a candidate for the party's general election) spoke next, supporting the repeal of this clause and advocating that the new Neutrality Act should define "war zones," that is, all areas within 300 miles of the coast of belligerent countries should be designated as war zones. In addition, Senator Clark, a populist Democrat, delivered a fierce speech, accusing Britain and France of being aggressor countries, saying that these countries refused to discuss peace, but have not declared war on the Soviet Union. The United States has no reason to support them. Clark finally commented on the war debt issue of the previous European war, and made many criticisms of Britain and France.

<h3>Under the Governance of Xue Yue, the Situation in Western Hunan Has Become Clear; Ambitious Individuals and Outlaws Have Awakened and Unanimously Embarked on the Road of Resistance</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The "Western Hunan Problem" was raised as early as the beginning of the Republic of China. However, since Linxiang and Yueyang successively fell into the hands of the Japanese army, and northern Hunan entered the first line of national defense, with western Hunan becoming an important support point for resistance and nation-building, the "Western Hunan Problem" has become particularly closely valued and noted by people. Due to the past "isolation" of western Hunan, and the dangerousness of its geographical situation, the thirty-one counties of western Hunan (accounting for more than one-third of the land and population of the entire Hunan province) became the most ideal base for secession for general ambitious individuals. Here, they could create a secessionist situation and manage their own small world. It is said that since the demise of a division of firearms in western Hunan when Yuan Shikai attacked Tang Jiyao in the fifth year of the Republic of China, this became the initial major capital for the ambitious individuals of western Hunan to stir up trouble. With this capital, they used various means to expand their strength and utilize the vast land of western Hunan, forcing the people to plant opium. Those who disobeyed the order were all levied with a "laziness tax," setting up checkpoints everywhere and levying exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, such as pit taxes and poll taxes, with a number of names that truly reached the peak of absurdity.</p>
<p>Central Problem</p>
<p>In addition to exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, ambitious individuals further involved their military and political power to implement the "Three Grabs Doctrine" and the "Four Disregards Policy." The so-called "Three Grabs Doctrine" is: (1) grab those with power, the purpose being to warn other powerful individuals not to dare to interfere with their actions; (2) grab those with money, so as to obtain ransom; (3) grab passersby, the so-called "toll." The "Four Disregards Policy" is: (1) disregard banditry and looting; (2) disregard official corruption; (3) disregard gambling in government offices; (4) disregard the harassment of stray soldiers. Under this "Three Grabs Doctrine" and "Four Disregards Policy," the so-called Western Hunan Problem formed three central problems: 1. The "Tu Wang" problem, representing the power of the larger ambitious individuals; 2. The "Bandit" problem, representing general scattered bandits; 3. The "Tu Gao" problem, namely opium. The first character of these three central problems is all "Tu" (土, meaning soil or local). Thus, what people generally call the Western Hunan Problem is also the "Three Tu Problems." Under the oppression of the Three Tu Problems, more than a thousand people in western Hunan, for the sake of self-defense, passively purchased some weapons to protect themselves, and actively gathered parties and gathered in the mountains and forests, making their living by "robbing homes and houses," to the point where, in certain places and at certain times, the "soldiers, civilians, and bandits" were indistinguishable from each other. In the past, it was rare for anyone to pass through western Hunan without being robbed. Later, small units such as a platoon or a company passing through western Hunan would even have their weapons confiscated entirely. When Hunan University moved from Changsha to Chenxi, it "paid an insurance fee" of 300 yuan per month for the safety of teachers and students. However, this insurance fee only guaranteed that there would be no trouble within five li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) around the school. Beyond this, they were not responsible. As for the Hunan-Guizhou Highway and the Yuanjiang waterway, robberies of vehicles and ships were endless and commonplace. Under these various rumors, many shortsighted people regarded western Hunan as an incomprehensible "chaos," or even thought that western Hunan society was still stuck in the dark ancient times of China.</p>
<p>The Crux of the Matter</p>
<p>Many people believe that western Hunan has become a problem due to the "special nature of the people of western Hunan" and the "poverty," "weakness," "ignorance," and "chaos" of the entire western Hunan society. In fact, the people of western Hunan are also descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Western Hunan is buried with endless treasures all over the mountains and fields, the most prominent being aluminum, lead, zinc, coal, iron, timber, tung oil, and tea. To be fair, antimony and tung oil account for a very important number in China's annual exports. This is sufficient proof that western Hunan is not poor. The spirit of hard work and endurance of the people of western Hunan is far unmatched by other places. The bandits of western Hunan are able to win more with less. In the past, the Gu Jia-ke Division, which launched a glorious battle in Jiaxing, eastern battlefield, was entirely composed of people from western Hunan. How can they be called weak? Education in western Hunan is indeed not widespread, and the level of culture is far lower than in other places. The feudal forces are also greater than in other places, but this cannot be considered that the people of western Hunan are inherently more ignorant than other places. Western Hunan is chaotic, that is a fact, but the root cause of the chaos is not in the "people's fondness for chaos," but in the attempt by a few ambitious individuals to occupy western Hunan by means of conquest, and a part of feudal relics relying on bandits to increase their own importance, and exploiting local diseases to prolong their dying days. As a result, local politics in western Hunan has never been on the right track, and the administration has never been clear. Under the layers of violence and the oppression of the "Three Tu Problems," the people, after paying exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, still cannot get a peaceful life, and thus can only rise up to defend themselves, or even take risks. What is the root cause of the Western Hunan Problem? In a nutshell, it lies in the "Tu Wang" and the "bandits" and "Tu Gao" caused by the "Tu Wang," as well as the alienation of the exorbitant taxes, the politics, and the people.</p>
<p>Problem Solved</p>
<p>Since General Xue Yue was ordered to concurrently govern Hunan Province in February of this year, he has put forward the three characters "An Bian Zu" (安便足, meaning peace, convenience, and sufficiency), and has the greatest determination to completely solve the Western Hunan Problem. This year, he has gradually abolished the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in western Hunan, selected and assisted military talents with political cultivation to serve as county magistrates, completely clarified the administration of western Hunan, and reduced the burden on the people. As for the elimination of the "Tu Wang," the prohibition of poppy cultivation, and the eradication of banditry, originally, there were many bandits in western Hunan because the "people could not make a living" and were forced to become bandits. Since Chairman Xue eliminated the "Tu Wang," he adopted a combination of suppression and appeasement, and combining benevolence and force, towards the bandits. As the Japanese army has already crossed the threshold of Hunan Province, the brave men of western Hunan, full of blood, have been repeatedly and earnestly instructed by Chairman Xue, and aroused with great righteousness, and finally unanimously abandoned their original involuntary life as outlaws, and embarked on the battlefield to fight for national liberation. On a clear morning in a blood-soaked May, the brave men of western Hunan, led by Generals Dai Xiao-tao and Long Yun-fei, gathered from various cities, mountains and forests, and corners of western Hunan to Yuan and Li, and then departed from Yuan and Li to the Qian-Xian front in northern Hunan. They were all wearing straw sandals, carrying guns, and wearing palm-leaf hats. Watching the large troops pass by, followed by one or two more teams, the formation was so orderly, and the discipline was so strict. General Dai spoke well at the farewell meeting held by all sectors of Yuan and Li, "The duty of a soldier is to protect the people in peacetime and defend the country in wartime. What's more, this is definitely to launch a national resistance against Japan, so this is the sacred task of a soldier. There is no need for a warm farewell, we should also run to the front line to fight. For the independence of the country, for the freedom of the nation, sacrifice is the most glorious. Sacrificing personal life can prolong the life of future generations. Sacrificing the lives of the soldiers of western Hunan can prolong the lives of the people of western Hunan. The whole country is determined to sacrifice their lives to fight for the final victory." The Western Hunan Problem, which has been unresolved for many years, symbolizes the future of this great national liberation struggle. To this fresh force in western Hunan that has joined the ranks of resistance from the perspective of national and ethnic interests, we only express our highest respect and place unlimited hope on them.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Nationalities Research Association Established; Chairman Long Elected Honorary President</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) Since the successive westward movement of university research institutions, in addition to Chongqing and Chengdu, Kunming is actually one of the academic centers. Furthermore, because Yunnan Province is located on the southwestern border, research on the culture and nationalities of the border areas is attracting the attention of academics. Therefore, Mr. Wu Dingliang and Mr. Wu Wenzao, humanistic science experts from the Academia Sinica, Southwest Associated University, and Yunnan University, initiated the establishment of the Yunnan Nationalities Research Association. After several preparations, the inaugural meeting was held last month at Zhigong Hall of Yunnan University. No fewer than six or seventy people attended. Xiong Qinglai, the President of Yunnan University, was publicly elected as the chairman. After the rituals were performed, the chairman gave an opening speech, and it was decided that Wu Wenzao would report on the preparation process. It was decided to discuss the constitution and elect officers, and then it was decided that military and political officers and representatives from all walks of life would give speeches. Chairman Long of Yunnan Province was elected as Honorary President, and Zhou Xingfu, Xiong Qinglai, Li Shuhua, and Tao Menghe, the Directors of the Civil Affairs and Education Bureaus of Yunnan Province, were elected as Honorary Vice Presidents. Li Ji, Wu Dingliang, Liang Siyong, Luo Xintian, Gu Jiegang, Pan Guangdan, Chen Da, Zhou Yuncang, Yuan Tongli, Yao Xunyuan, Wen You, Ling Chunsheng, Wu Wenzao, and other thirteen people were elected as directors, and Wu Dingliang was elected as chairman of the board by the board of directors, Wu Wenzao as secretary, and Zhou Yuncang as accountant, and it was decided to carry out the following association affairs: (1) hold a lecture meeting once a month, inviting Chinese and foreign experts to serve; (2) organize an editorial and compilation committee for a bibliography and abstracts of southwest ethnology literature, divided into several groups, with three to five members serving; (3) organize a Yunnan materials specimen committee; (4) organize a southwest ethnology research work investigation committee. The establishment of this association at this time is said to be meaningful.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Training Scoutmasters (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yang Kejing</p>
<p>Elaboration on the Necessity of Training Scoutmasters</p>
<p>It is indeed perfect if Scout teachers are trained by normal schools. However, before the normal schools offer scout courses, what should be done before there are graduates with this qualification? In my opinion, the national normal colleges should run refresher courses for scout teachers, and in accordance with the regulations for refresher courses for teachers prescribed by the Ministry, select the current unqualified scout teachers in primary and secondary schools and provide them with one year of professional training. There are six normal colleges nationwide, and each college selects 100 people each year, for a total of 600 people to receive training. Within a few years, a large number of excellent scout teachers can also be trained. Second, set up summer training courses, imitating the method of summer training courses for physical education teachers. The education authorities of various provinces and cities, together with other relevant agencies, utilize the summer vacation to train scout instructors from the entire province, and provide them with one to two months of professional training. It is common that progress in the knowledge and skills of scout leaders is not small. This is also a remedial measure for training scoutmasters during the transition period. Someone asked, "The Central Training Corps has already been comprehensively training scout cadres. The Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class has now been established in Hechuan, and it is said that it plans to continue to run for a long time. Then, is it not necessary to train scoutmasters in normal schools?" It is not the case. A seatmate said, "All things grow together without harming each other, and ways run in parallel without contradicting each other." The Central Training Corps is a continuation of the Lushan and Emeishan Training Corps. The purpose of training focuses on the ideological and spiritual aspects, in order to promote the unity of national will, thought, and action, and sincere unity, so as to increase the strength of resistance and nation-building, rather than professional training. This is very clear. Therefore, the object of its training is talents who have already become capable, rather than those who have not yet become capable. For example, military and police training is to select the current officers and police officers for training, not to replace political schools and law schools to directly train students. Again, for example, the training of teachers and staff is to select the current teachers and staff of various levels of schools for training, not to replace normal schools, sports schools, and various universities to directly train students. The same is true for scout teachers. First, they receive professional training in normal schools, and after graduation, they serve in primary and secondary schools, and then they are selected by the Central Training Corps to receive training in spirit and thought. The two are in fact mutually connected, running in parallel without contradiction. Someone also said, "Suppose the Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class of the Central Training Corps extends the study period and increases professional training. It already has the original ideological and spiritual training of the Central Training Corps, and it also has the scout professional training of normal schools. Wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone?" To answer this question, it is necessary to compare the normal schools and the Central Training Corps first. If the Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class has all the conditions of a normal school and replaces it, it is not impossible. If it cannot have all the conditions of a normal school, it is better to follow the general method of the Central Training Corps, and during the summer and winter holidays, select the current heads and coaches of scout troops in primary and secondary schools, and give them one month of training in spirit, thought, and life discipline. This will not hinder the students' studies, nor will it cause them to incur the loss of hiring someone to substitute for them and paying them remuneration. Moreover, they can listen to the instructions of important party, government, and military officials, and the lectures of the country's first-class scholars, and understand the government's painstaking efforts for the country and the people, and the major domestic and foreign policies, and subtly influence them to return to their hometowns after training, work hard to serve, unite sincerely, consolidate the central government, and increase the strength of resistance and nation-building. In this way, it will surely receive twice the result with half the effort. The current Chinese Scout Instructor Training Class was originally run by the Chinese Scout Association and the Ministry of Education. In addition to the teachers serving in the Teacher Service Corps being trained, it also recruits personnel with at least two years of service after graduating from high school or above to supplement. The term is three months, and professional training is provided. The purpose is to train crash personnel to meet the current urgent needs. After the start of the class, the class began to apply for acceptance by the Central Training Corps, so the methods in the class are mostly the same as before, which is slightly different from the general methods of the Corps Headquarters. The training of scoutmasters is the most urgent task at present, and professional training should be carried out in accordance with the regulations for normal education prescribed by the Ministry of Education. Crash courses should not be easily opened. As for spiritual training and ideological training, they should be统筹managed by the Central Training Corps. Now, based on what I have seen, I have expressed them specifically. I hope that fellow comrades in the scout world across the country will not hesitate to offer their gems, think for the sake of the cause, express their opinions, in order to get a perfect method, then it will be fortunate.</p>

With less competition time, the number of participating teams has to be limited. It is learned that if the number of registered teams is too large, it will be decided to hold a qualifying tournament before the start of the tournament. Only the stronger teams will be formally allowed to join the league competition, and the weaker teams will be eliminated. Once the preparations are in place, registration will begin soon. Also, the new referees of the Association will be assigned to practice in the league. According to reports, the competition began in 1928, with Shanghai University and Ye Shi Team winning the championships in Groups A and B. After that, Group A became the exclusive domain of the West China YMCA, which lasted for as many as eight years (Haizhe and Xintong were both incarnations of the West China YMCA). In the previous competition, Mai Ling's officers rose to replace them. In the last competition, the Chinese giants Paramount failed at the last minute, and the championship fell into the hands of Mai Ling Hong. The competition was originally divided into two groups, A and B. Group C was added in 1934, and the University Group was added in 1936. Last year, only one group was held. This year, it will roughly follow the example of the previous competition and not divide into groups. Here are the past championship records:</p>

In the second match, Yuet Kwong's Dai Mingna played against Qing's Zhu Huimin. The competition was extremely tense, lasting until the fifth set.

<p>Qing's Xia Xia Reverses Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>The fourth match, featuring Yuet Kwong's chop shot expert Lin Yunxia against Qing's topspin expert Xia Xia, was one of the most exciting moments of the night. Xia initially lost two sets but, amid the applause of the audience, won three consecutive sets, reversing the defeat into victory. The fifth match, between Yuet Kwong's Liang Huixian and Qing's team captain Tang Shufen, was as thrilling as the Lin-Xia match.

In the sixth match, Yuet Kwong's Huang Ying easily defeated Qing's Li Fengzhu, leveling the score at 3-3.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Chips Loosen, Cash Not Easy to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the dark market for cash transactions ("烚赤") showed a weakening trend. This was due to the strengthening of foreign exchange and the concentration of negative news. Although the Hong Kong syndicate did not change its usual style, its appetite was not as strong as before. Many retail investors, seeing the unfavorable environment, had the idea of selling off. As a result, there were quite a few chips in the market, leading to a gradual loosening and downward trend. The price once nearly fell below the 4,000 yuan mark, but ultimately remained strong, only falling by a small 14 yuan. The day's initial situation was relatively stable, opening at a high price of 4,023 yuan. Subsequently, due to the strengthening of foreign exchange, there was no change. However, securities firms and retail investors had already decided to sell, and few overseas firms were buying. By the midday close, the price had fallen to 4,008 yuan. In the afternoon, news of further loosening of foreign exchange emerged, so buyers were scarce. Ultimately, due to the aggressive selling by securities firms, the market opened at a low price of 4,000 yuan. Then, due to a sudden surge of buying from the Hong Kong syndicate, short positions of securities firms were forced to cover, and the price rose by more than ten yuan. Finally, the market closed at 4,010 yuan. With the possibility of vigorous developments in the European war in the coming days, and the news of China's victory flying in like snowflakes, it is not easy to expect gold prices to rise. Trading volume was relatively light that day, only about 700 taels. Gold jewelry prices in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day. Customs gold, etc., also remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Transactions Fell Very Slightly</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial situation for each bar (ten taels) was relatively stable, only slightly lower than the previous day by a small amount. Money changers did 20 taels, quoted at 4,023 yuan. Shortly after, hearing that foreign exchange was slightly firmer, this triggered selling by retail investors, and silver shops also slightly hedged. The market steadily declined, falling another small 12 yuan. Cash firms sold ten taels to a certain gold shop for 4,011 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to buy, and retail investors also showed a weakening intention to sell, causing a slight rebound. A certain gold shop purchased several dozen taels from money changers and counterparts, once raising the price to 4,018 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms suddenly began to sell, and the interest of buyers was quite weak, immediately falling another ten yuan. Gold shops sold thirty taels to money changers for 4,008 yuan. At that time, a certain money changer absorbed slightly on behalf of customers, raising the price by five yuan. A certain money changer took in twenty taels from counterparts, priced at 4,013 yuan. Nearing midday, the selling pressure from securities firms rose again, and the situation was weak again. Securities firms sold thirty taels to gold shops for 4,008 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening was because foreign exchange was slightly firmer again, and there was a lack of buyers, actually reducing the midday closing price by eight yuan. Gold shops sold ten taels to money changers, quoted at 4,000 yuan. Later, securities firms suddenly gained profits and re-entered, plus the Hong Kong syndicate followed suit. Although silver shops took the opportunity to hedge, and money changers sold off on behalf of retail investors, the positions were still felt to be over-supplied for a time, and soon rebounded by fifteen yuan. Money changers did twenty taels, priced at 4,015 yuan. After entering, there were gradually fewer buyers, and a decline of eight yuan was immediately seen. Silver shops sold twenty taels to money changers for 4,007 yuan. At the evening close, silver shops took in dozens of taels, causing a raise of three yuan. A certain silver shop purchased ten taels from money changers, priced at 4,010 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, there was a fourteen yuan fall, a twenty-three yuan difference for the entire day. The selling price of cash firms' benchmark gold was ten yuan higher than the transaction price, and the purchase price was about thirty yuan lower. The current benchmark gold is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and both are seldom traded.</p>
<p>The exchange price for gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day, as cash transactions still had no significant changes. Datong Hang still quoted 405 yuan, and the new counterpart had the same price. The purchase price must be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Buying and Selling is Tentative; US Exchange Forward Rates Rise Sharply; Swap Points Seen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. In the unofficial market for British-American exchange, the initial morning situation saw the British rate continue to tighten at 0.3125 because overseas American exchange for British exchange rebounded by two points. The American rate did not show any rise or fall. Although foreign banks like Chase National Bank had a bit of an appetite in the middle of the day, because Chinese banks came to sell, and negative news on the market was still strong, other buyers were quite scarce, so the trend gradually loosened and strengthened. By about 11:30 AM, both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and the situation became even quieter. In the midday closing, the American exchange was slightly firmer again, while the British gold did not change at all. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants sold off slightly, and American banks also intended to sell, so the situation was unsustainable and continued to loosen. As a result, the British rate tightened by 0.046875, and the American rate also rose by 0.09375. As for the trend in futures, because foreign banks were more inclined to sell, the current month and spot prices were seen to have flattened out, while the November term also slightly tightened. Trading volume was flat throughout the day.</p>
<p>The Market Situation is Very Quiet</p>
<p>The initial morning saw London's recent big items shrink by 25, forward rates fell by 125, New York silver prices fell by half a cent, and London's raw gold was stagnant. For exchange rates, British exchange for American, Shanghai, French, and other exchanges were all flat. American exchange for British rose by two points, for Shanghai rose by five points, and for French rose by one point three seven five. The Central Bank's listed rates for each exchange remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4 pence 53125 for British gold and 7 yuan 53125 for American exchange. Compared to the previous close, the British slightly tightened by 0.015625, and the American did not show any rise or fall. This was because exchange rates rebounded. The initial situation was quiet after opening. Until HSBC's listed rates were announced, there was no change, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be only a small 2.5 cents. After that, Chinese banks, such as Shanghai, came to sell, and a certain bank also slightly sold off. However, foreign banks, such as Chase National Bank and Li, had a relatively good appetite, so the market situation still did not change much, only showing slight strengthening. Chinese banks sold spot British gold to Chase National Bank and Li for 4 pence 5625. Then, Shanghai and a certain bank sold spot American exchange to foreign banks for 7 yuan 5625. After 10:30 AM, fewer and fewer transactions were made, so the process was less and less exciting. Until the midday close, British gold did not change, while American exchange was slightly firmer again. British was still counted at 4 pence 5625, and American was 7 yuan 59375. Compared to the opening in the morning, British rebounded loosely by 0.03125, and American tightened by 0.0625.</p>
<p>There Were Slightly More Sellers in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The situation in the after-market was still flat, continuing to be slightly</p>
<p>tight. It was heard that Chinese merchants first sold spot British gold to a certain bank for 4 pence 59375. Afterwards, American banks also sold spot British gold to counterpart banks for 4 pence 59375, and spot American exchange for 7 yuan 625. Extending to the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 59375 for British gold and 7 yuan 625 for American exchange. The current month was the same as the previous price, and the November British gold was 4 pence 53125 and the American exchange was 7 yuan and a half. (The above prices may not be satisfactory for Chinese merchants and foreign firms, etc., to settle their accounts.) As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British was loose by 0.046875 and the American was tight by 0.09375. The futures British rose by 0.0625 and the American sharply loosened by 0.15625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 17th Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning, and exchange rates in various places did not rise or fall. At 11:30, it was stable and did not move. The Shanghai exchange fell slightly by one yuan in the afternoon, to 326 yuan. At 2:30 PM, the opening was stable and the market had no changes.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Loosens</p>

"United Notes" in the unofficial market rose slightly by half a yuan to 85 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Firm and Rising, Foreign Stocks Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the unofficial market for Unified Public Bonds, after a period of consolidation, saw a firm and rising trend again. The market atmosphere rose again because the intermittent atmosphere of peace continued to make noise in the market. Although it is not worth the attention of knowledgeable people, it inevitably aroused the excitement of ordinary, weak-willed speculators. And with the war progressing smoothly, and finance reaching the ultimate consolidation, although many beneficial atmospheres swarm to the market, many parties have successively absorbed them, and the momentum is quite vigorous. And sellers have sold off at high prices, and competition has been extremely fierce, so the market price has been obstructed from rising, only rising by 3 to 4.5 cents. The trading volume was flat, about 600,000 yuan. Overall, if there is no special stimulus in the market, it is still likely to consolidate with a rising trend.</p>
<p>For stocks, 200 shares of China Merchant Electric Stock were traded, priced at 5 yuan and 6 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Association of All Trades and Industries opened firmly, and after entering, it slightly softened, and prices slightly fell. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Trust stock, after deducting a dividend of 5 yuan yesterday, once rose to 62 yuan, but this price could not be held for long. It consolidated all day at a slightly lower price. Trading in Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill stock was quite brisk, but the market had no advancing trend, only revolving. The closing price fell by 5 cents compared to the highest price. International Savings Society stock was very active, but the price that rose in the early morning almost completely retreated. Yeeson Shipyard stock surged to 117 yuan, and the trading volume was extremely large. In terms of rubber stocks, several well-known stocks were relatively active. The market also tended to soften at the close. The market, after several periods of activity and pull-up, has now slightly returned to weakness, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of Rubber Estates of Krian, Limited, managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm in Shanghai, decided yesterday to pay an interim dividend of 4 cents per share in national currency from October 27th, covering the one-year period ending at the end of April 1940.</p>
<p>London, 16th Telegram: Today's listed market prices for Central China's Far East companies' stocks saw coal stocks slightly rise. Mercantile Bank shares rose 5 shillings, to 7 pounds even.

The rest moved slightly.</p>
<p>London, 16th Telegram: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt were generally flat, with only Crisp Loans falling by half a pound, priced at 17 and a half pounds.</p>
<h3>Grain: Du Japonica Rice is Stable, Passenger Indica Rice Arrivals are Scarce and Firm</h3>
<p>There were no shipments of rice from the lower reaches of the river.</p>
<p>New goods, such as Car Wheel Baozi, Lai Su, and Kunfengjia, totaled more than 4,000 bags. Early morning sales to local routes were still active, so the passenger's sentiment remained firm. The price of each product was uniformly shouted up by 3 to 5 cents. By midday, wholesale sales were weak again, and the market tended to be flat, so the closing market price was tight first and weak later, resulting in a set result. Changxi special grade broken rice traded at 32 yuan, Gao 30 yuan, second grade 27 yuan. Su Tongchang Kun white broken rice ranged from 27 yuan to 25-26 yuan, new Japonica high 28 yuan, city 26 yuan, decided to 24 yuan. Qingjiao kiln seeds lacked goods and had no market. Fenjia Baige high 28 yuan, decided to 26 yuan and a half, special Yangjian 23 yuan and 2 cents, to 21 yuan and a half, Lushanjian special 23 yuan 6-7 cents to 22 yuan, Jiangbei Jian 19 yuan 2-3 cents to 19 yuan, Nanjing special Jian 19 yuan 8 cents, high 19 yuan shouted 5 cents, middle city 19 yuan, Wuhu special Jian 19 yuan 5 cents, city 19 yuan, middle 18 yuan 8 cents, second to 18 yuan 3 cents, Jian 17 yuan 7 cents to 17 yuan and a half, old 31 yuan to 30 yuan, new white 25-26 yuan, Unified city transaction totaled tens of thousands of bags.</p>
<p>Another message: Continuous Japanese passenger sales are gradually booming.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market continued to see progress, although the municipal inventory was still sufficient. The northern Jiangsu Indica rice has already stopped handling due to insufficient cost, and recent arrivals have gradually decreased. The number of arrivals of Jing Wu Indica rice in recent days has also decreased. Japanese merchants also lack complete batch sales. Yesterday, due to rumors of purchasing certificate issues, people's hearts turned upward, and shops in rural villages in the interior had undiminished demand. Prices rose again by 2-3-4 cents. Jing Wu top Indica rice opened at 20 yuan 034 cents. The market price was around 19 yuan and a half, a middle-end decision of 18 yuan and a half to around 18 yuan. Rice 17-18 yuan, brown rice around 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Turn Stable, Wheat Rises Another Two Cents</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's current flour mill prices turned into a set situation, with authentic No. 2 flour continuing to open at 7 yuan and 2 cents in cash. The market for recycled goods also tended to be peaceful, because the sales of both the northern and southern syndicates were slightly weak, and they all had the intention of handling small amounts again, so the market was less excited. Warship brand transit goods continued to open above 7 yuan and 1 cent. The old car and Red Blue Fuxin brands' transit orders were similar to the mill prices. The entire market transaction totaled 30-40,000 bags. It was heard that the Japanese factory's Phoenix brand flour was also being dumped by hoarders, and the price fell back to 6 yuan 8 cents 4-5 cents. 4,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong today, and another 2,000 bags were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, wheat continued to be strong, because after a sharp rise once the day before, people's hearts were quite excited, and they all intended to sell at a good price. The mill and hoarders both had a weak buying appetite. The Fuxin Fufeng mills together handled 1,500 bags, and the hoarders handled only one or two cars. The highest price was 10 yuan and 3 cents, an increase of about two cents compared to before.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Multi-Headedness Less Exciting, Market Falling Still Slow</h3>
<p>The yarn market feels even more sluggish, and the situation does not deviate from a hovering realm. The needs of the Hong Kong and mainland syndicates are slightly more lively, but the amounts of purchases are minimal, so the hearts of the market could not be lifted. General speculators, seeing the poor environment, are unfavorable for the multi-headed party, and have little excitement for buying. But the amounts hoarded by the general wealthy people have not been released, so although the actual need is stagnant, the number of chips feels even more increased. The market falling is still slow.</p>
<p>The current yarn's morning opening is still scattered and weak.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the opening, 50 bags of 20-count Tiannv spot goods were transacted, priced at 679 yuan, which was a transaction between counterparts. Although other brokers were shouting, there were very few buyers. There were even more sellers of Double Horse, but eaters were slow to appear. After a long time of delay, the spot opening price was 712 yuan, falling by 1 yuan. The transit order price was 697 yuan, but it was all temporary grab-a-cap nature. By the closing, it was seen that 2-3 yuan was falling off again. It was found that 1,308 bags were traded in half a day. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 4 yuan, Tiannv rose by 5 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 2 yuan. The factory opened 200 bags of 10-count Jiahe from the Wing On Factory, priced at 530 yuan. 70 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amounts bought by each syndicate are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Cotton Buying and Selling: Counterparts Comparatively Active</h3>
<p>Transactions in local cotton were smoother than before. Japanese factories</p>
<p>slightly needed white cotton. As for the Chinese factories, in addition to the new purchase from Xinsheng, other yarn factories had little energy. However, the entry and exit of counterparts has become more active. The selling price is still stable. The incoming cotton from northern Jiangsu is still maintainable. 2,088 bags of Tongzhou cotton arrived, 350 pieces of north sand cotton, and no arrival of Changyinsha cotton has been heard of. There were 495 pieces shipped to Hong Kong today. The current cotton selling prices and bag amounts are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message: Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai have seen no progress recently due to the stagnation of exchange rates. Factories quietly hold their hopes. Counterparts also do not want to handle it because of this, so transactions are very quiet. Recent arrivals of Tongzhou cotton have been crowded, which is the factory's main reason for holding a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>The market price for foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was quite firm in the early morning, and appeared to be active. Domestic factory needs have also gradually become smoother. The sales of cloth have also shown improvement, so this triggered the purchase of counterparts and the offsetting of some short positions. Until the closing, the market price rose 5-6 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian, including forecasts, rose by two rupees, Egyptian fell by 30 pounds, and Liverpool fell by four pence.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Cotton Cloth Hand Goods Sold Off at Cheap Prices</h3>
<p>The market for cloth saw slight development in the current sales of local and foreign syndicates, and the market has stabilized. However, scattered retail goods were sold off at loose prices, and the market for some of the cloths continued to decline, and prices were quite chaotic. The price of white goods, light and heavy weight coarse cloth, fell by 5 cents to 1.5 cents per bolt. There was very little trading in fine cloth and fine twill, falling by 2 cents per bolt. The market for bleached and dyed cloth and flannel was stable, and a small number still had cheap prices. In addition to the continued allocation of goods for actual needs, local street wholesale shops have very little interest. In addition to shipping scheduled goods, the Guangdong syndicate has no new purchasing appetite. The Yong syndicate handled over 100 pieces of light and heavy weight coarse cloth and printed flannel. The Fujian syndicate handled 30-40 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and fine cloth. The purchasing appetite in foreign regions such as Mumbai, Cebu, and Singapore is still healthy. The transaction of red foreign standard, printed cloth, and satin totaled over 4,000 bolts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, white goods and colored goods in Dong 疋 first fell and then rebounded, resulting in stable. The leading fine cloth sold at a low price of over 20 yuan in the morning market. The after-market rebounded to 20 yuan 02.5 cents. Four Gentlemen serge fell to 6 cents 3.5 cents per yard, and also rebounded to 6 cents 4.5 cents, because the foreign firm's opening price was still high, and the northern syndicate had a little purchasing interest, and the counterparts' sentiment tended to stabilize slightly. It was heard that traders made about 400 pieces of fine cloth in total. The monthly contracted opening price for Leading Brand was 20 yuan 05 cents per bolt, and the next month's was 20 yuan 07.5 cents. Qinhuangdao had healthier intake from the northern sales, and over 300 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were traded. The Tianjin syndicate handled over 200 pieces. Local dye factories also took in 3-400 pieces.</p>
<p>40 pieces of export cloth were shipped to Singapore today, another 450 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 185 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Ignoring Expensive Prices, Woolen Business is Particularly Booming</h3>
<p>Woolen serge is still rising straight ahead. Not only the autumn and winter goods currently needed for sale, but also the goods needed for sale in the spring and summer of the coming year, are regarded as rare goods. What is strange is that although the price of goods is soaring, the sales route is still not weak. Even the isolated islands at sea have prosperous sales, which surpass the pre-war level. If you bought woolen serge clothing materials at this time last year, you could get high-quality western goods of full wool for 1 yuan 3-4 cents per foot. If you were thrifty, you could buy cut towel woven goods for over 7 cents per foot. Now, the most basic, unsightly goods must be sold for 1 yuan 1-2 cents per foot. If you want to get high-quality, full-wool western goods, you must pay more than 3 yuan per foot. It used to cost about 45 yuan per set to custom-make western suits at western clothing stores. Even if you wear rough clothing, it is not inferior. Now it costs 60 yuan a set, and the lining is not as good as it used to be. Also, it used to cost over 70 yuan to order a long-haired wool female overcoat, but now it is difficult to do without more than 100 yuan. This shows the general rise in woolen goods.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Speculative Manipulation, Soybean Oil Raises Madly to 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market situation created a shocking new record. In the morning, carrying on the momentum of the previous day, and with people's hearts already tense, the opening jumped by 1.5 yuan. In the afternoon, a general manipulator violently pulled up the price, and large households added fuel to the fire, creating an unprecedentedly high price. Kobe oil closed at 70 yuan, 150 barrels of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 50 yuan, 10 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at 50 yuan 05 cents, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were also traded at 50 yuan 05 cents, 10 barrels of white squeezed oil were priced at 65 yuan, and 500 cans of white squeezed oil were priced at 65 yuan 5 cents. 180 cans of Wenzhou oil were priced at 63 yuan 5 cents. The above transactions were completely mutual transfers, and actual sales were reduced, because the local market price in Xichang and other places was lower than the Shanghai market due to the fact that various factories had goods available for sale, so the soaring price yesterday could not be sustained, and it is predicted that there will be a sharp setback. It was found that 1,080 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 380 bags of raw kernels, 600 bags of soybeans, and 2,000 blocks of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong and then to Singapore. 1,950 bags of soybeans and 2,000 blocks of bean cake.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Market Summary</h3>
<p>US Dollar Notes Fall Slightly by One Cent Three: Yesterday's foreign currency market, with the exchange market trending towards a looser trend, was less sustainable. It once fell to 13 yuan 2 cents, and finally closed at 13 yuan 2 cents 5 cents. As a result, it continued to fall slightly by one cent and three cents compared to the previous day. Canadian notes and Australian gold notes tended to be soft. The former fell by 1 yuan, and the latter also fell by 1 yuan 5 cents. Japanese gold notes continued to fall by 3 cents. The Korean notes' falling trend was even stronger, falling by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day, priced at 1 yuan 1 cent 2 cents. Only Singapore notes rose by 1 cent, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Ginkgo nut's high price fell back by more than half: Ginkgo nuts fell in price because of poor harvest. When new products first appeared, Hong Kong syndicate was willing to purchase at high prices, once up to 60-70 yuan. But as the number of arrivals increased recently, the number of consumers decreased. Prices dropped step by step, with the lowest being only 28-29 yuan. The current market price is around 30 yuan.</p>

<p>According to the French-language "Shanghai Daily" on the 17th, the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Public Concession announced that its dispute with the "Special Municipality of Shanghai" regarding roads outside the settlement will be handed over to the Shanghai Consular Body for resolution. According to the PWD, the biggest point of contention in this case is not only the police authority issue, but also the tax revenue issue. All the houses along these extra-settlement roads enjoy the benefits of the PWD's public utilities. Therefore, the matter should be handed over to the Consular Body for resolution. The PWD has already complained to the Shanghai Consular Body about the various overstepping behaviors of the puppet municipal government in building roads outside the settlement in the western district, as well as its attempts to seize the tax revenue of the concession authorities. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the PWD, to ask for his opinion.</p>
<p>Hoping Residents Will Pay Taxes to the PWD</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden replied that the PWD hopes that residents on the extra-settlement roads will continue to pay taxes to the PWD, but does not want to take any direct action. The dispute over the matter has been submitted to the Consular Body for handling. The reporter then asked if the PWD would advise residents on the extra-settlement roads to refuse to pay taxes to other agencies. Mr. Fessenden said that he was very sorry and could not answer this question.</p>
<p>Date of Consular Body Meeting Undecided</p>
<p>The reporter also learned from the Shanghai Municipal Council that the Consular Body has not yet set a date for a meeting to discuss the extra-settlement road issue. At present, the consuls-general of the countries concerned with the Public Concession are only studying it individually.</p>
<p>Chinese Are the Most Affected</p>
<p>However, in the current situation, the collection of taxes by the puppet municipal government in the extra-settlement road area affects Chinese residents the most. Because Western residents in the area are protected by their respective consuls, they can refuse to pay taxes to any agency other than the PWD. Therefore, the puppet municipal government's financial bureau's attempts to collect house and land taxes from foreign residents in the extra-settlement road area have been met with closed doors. However, according to Western opinions, Chinese residents in the area have no place to appeal because there is no Chinese government authority here at present. This is the crux of the extra-settlement road tax issue.</p>
<p>Difficulties Arise Due to Foreign Opposition</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported a message published in the Japanese-run "New Shanghai News," stating that the "municipal government" of Shanghai's collection of a "municipal tax" in the western district extra-settlement road area has encountered difficulties due to the relationship between foreign residents and foreign business managers. The newspaper acknowledged that the director of the "Western District Tax Collection Office" has requested the "municipal government's diplomatic department" to continue negotiations with the Public Concession authorities. The purpose of the negotiations is to enable the "municipal government" to collect taxes from foreigners living and doing business in the area.</p>
<p>Poor Results in Collecting House Taxes</p>
<p>The newspaper also said that "the municipal government began collecting house taxes in a very limited area of the district from March of this year. After consultation, it was able to collect more house taxes in a larger area. So far, 20,000 yuan in house taxes have been collected. It has been difficult to collect taxes from residents of Yu Garden Road and locations lacking public utilities, but these problems have been resolved. As for the collection of taxes from foreigners in the district, Mr. Zhu, the "Director of the Tax Collection Office," recently requested the "municipal government" to consult with the Public Concession authorities to resolve this problem." According to reports, when the "municipal government" wanted to collect "winter house taxes" a few weeks ago, it announced that foreigners should also pay taxes.</p>
<p>Rumor of New Instructions Received by US Authorities</p>
<p>Foreign news: The various illegal actions taken by the Japanese in the concession recently have aroused serious attention from the consulates. After a certain foreigner telegraphed his government in detail, he has now received new instructions to make statements about the illegal actions of the Japanese. There will be new developments in the coming days.</p>
<h3>New Taikoo Steamer Passengers; More Than Three Hundred People Died; Turning Around Against the Wind Caused Sinking in Less Than Five Minutes; Japanese Shipowner's Lack of Experience Led to the Disaster</h3>
<p>The two ships, Taikoo No. 18 Maru and New Taikoo Maru, belonging to the Japanese-owned Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, were operating on the Xinkou (Jingjiang County) line. The New Taikoo Maru left Xinkou for Shanghai (mistakenly stated as exiting) on the morning of the 16th, fully loaded with cargo and carrying more than 400 passengers, exceeding the prescribed number. When it reached a point 12 nautical miles from the mouth of the Wusong River, near the lighthouse, the wind was strong and the waves were high. Because the passengers and cargo were overloaded, the ship could not withstand the wind and waves. The Japanese shipowner, in an attempt to save the situation, steered the ship close to the shallow waters to avoid capsizing. Unexpectedly, the bow of the ship turned to the right and was hit hard by the wind and waves. The ship then tilted to the right and capsized. In less than five minutes, the ship and cargo were completely submerged, and all the passengers were drowned. Ten minutes later, the wind and waves gradually subsided.</p>
<p>More Than Three Hundred Passengers Died</p>
<p>Although a Japanese merchant's tugboat, carrying two pig barges, and the Anhe and Hanhe ships passed by during the sinking, they were unable to provide assistance due to the strong wind and waves and the fact that they were fully loaded. Yesterday's report that the Hanhe ship rescued more than 60 people was completely misinformation. Of the more than 400 passengers, only 49 people were rescued by the Japanese warship Yixian, which was seized by the Japanese and dispatched urgently after the incident, and 18 people were rescued by a certain Japanese ship. The rest are feared to have been completely buried in the bellies of fish. One of the rescued women died from drinking too much water. Among the crew, two Japanese, one the shipowner and the other the chief mate, also drowned. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha immediately dispatched the Seizan Maru to the scene of the incident for rescue after receiving the report the day before yesterday. It returned to Shanghai that night without any results. It is said that the Japanese transport ship Kyobashi Maru also brought 17 rescued passengers yesterday morning, and a small ship also rescued 20 passengers. They all landed at Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Customs Warns Vessels to Pay Attention</p>
<p>As the ship sank in a major traffic route, the Jianghai Customs issued a warning yesterday morning, advising all vessels to pay special attention when passing the sunken ship to avoid accidentally touching it and causing an accident. At the same time, several of the Customs' lifeboats were dispatched to the scene for rescue, but the ship had completely sunk into the water, so rescue was impossible.</p>
<p>Total Loss of the Ship Exceeds One Million</p>
<p>It is understood that the New Taikoo ship had a load capacity of 108 tons and a length of 85 feet. The shipowner was a Japanese named Nomo. There were more than 20 Japanese crew members on the ship (all of whom are now missing). It was loaded with a large number of cotton and groceries, worth more than 110,000 yuan. The total loss of the ship is more than 1 million yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Yamanaka and others from the East Asia Shipping Association also went to the scene of the incident by boat to investigate and are currently handling the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Organizations to Welcome Philippine Vice President Today; China-Philippines Relations Have Always Been Cordial; Special Reception to Be Held at the International Hotel</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Chinese Industrial Association, and the International Affairs Research Association have decided to hold a tea party at the International Hotel at 4:00 PM today to welcome Philippine Vice President Osmeña, who is returning home via Shanghai, in view of the cordial relations between China and the Philippines. At that time, Mr. Lin Chao-pin, Manager of Huafei Tobacco Company, Mr. Wang Tian-shen, Manager of Chung Hsing Bank, and Mr. Hu Gui-geng, Manager of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, will be invited to accompany him. It is said that the International Affairs Research Association is generally responsible for the reception matters.</p>
<h3>No Confirmation of Second Batch of Fractional Currency Issuance</h3>
<p>Three-Cent Tram Tickets Valid</p>
<p>Until the 20th</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, in order to prevent large quantities from flowing into the occupied areas, it solemnly issued them, limiting each household to 20 yuan. In recent days, many companies and firms have been applying for exchange, and more than 450,000 yuan has been issued. It is expected that the planned 500,000 yuan will be issued completely within this week. It is learned that after the head office ordered the Hong Kong office to sign a printing contract with the American-owned Wing On Company for the second batch of 500,000 yuan,</p>
<p>When Will Printing Be Completed?</p>
<p>Shipping to Shanghai for issuance was not completed by last night, according to the head office's telegram. Rumors that printing has been completed, shipping to Shanghai, and issuing at the end of the month, as well as the additional issuance of two-cent notes, are probably not true. As for the fractional currency notes issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, there are three types: one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent, which are used exclusively in the interior of Zhejiang Province. Although those holding these fractional currency notes can cash them at the Shanghai Branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, they are not issued in Shanghai. It is also rumored that counterfeit five-cent notes of the Central Bank's fractional currency have been discovered. The bank has denied this, saying that a person recently requested the identification of the authenticity of a five-cent note. The bank</p>
<p>Identified as Genuine</p>
<p>Because the note had been soaked in water, it was blurred and unclear. Because the fractional currency note has a ground pattern, counterfeiting is very difficult. In addition, the various denomination value tickets issued by the two tram companies in the city have flowed into the hands of the people in extremely large numbers. However, because they have been in common use for a long time, many are broken and unusable. In addition, the Central Bank's new notes have already been fully circulated on the market. In fact, for this type of denomination tickets</p>
<p>No Longer Needed</p>
<p>The two companies have formally notified all ticket sellers to recover them in full. Those who have accumulated many can directly exchange them at the two companies. It is also learned that the Public Concession tram company issued a three-cent denomination ticket, which was originally planned to be withdrawn immediately due to the discovery of counterfeit tickets being mixed in. However, because change was needed, the deadline was specially extended to the 20th of this month (i.e., the day after tomorrow). Citizens who have any of these tickets remaining should exchange them at the company as soon as possible, so as to avoid being refused acceptance after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Local Weather Turns Sunny; Hurricane Approaching Japan</h3>
<p>After the drastic change in the local weather, the rain and wind stopped the night before last. The weather turned sunny and cool yesterday morning. However, the waterlogged low-lying roads have not yet receded. It was also found that there was another high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. At that time, the low-lying roads and sewers overflowed again. The Pacific hurricane passed over the sea east of Shanghai and continued to move in a north-easterly direction. This morning, it had extended to the sea off the southern suburbs of Japan, and the wind force was very strong.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Women's Community Initiates Campaign to Collect 100,000 Sets of Winter Clothing; 50,000 Sets to Be Collected and 50,000 Sets to Be Made, to Be Collected Before the End of November</h3>
<p>The women's community in this city, in view of the gradually cold weather and the lack of winter clothing for women, children, and refugees, urgently needs relief. Therefore, a meeting was held at the YMCA a few days ago to discuss the campaign to collect winter clothing and the voluntary making of winter clothing. It was decided to collect 50,000 sets of winter clothing and make 50,000 sets of winter clothing, a total of 100,000 sets. The funds for making winter clothing will be raised by the representatives attending the meeting, and they must be collected before the end of November. After they are made, they will be distributed to various refugee relief organizations for use.</p>

<h3>Panic Among Residents After Japanese Post Boundary Markers; Migration Intensifies, Empty Houses Increase; East of North Jiangxi Road, Vehicles Are Prohibited</h3>
<p>At the junction of North Henan Road and Bazilu in Area A north of Suzhou Creek, the Japanese army added boundary markers to the wall of the Delong Cigarette Factory the day before yesterday, intending to completely distinguish the boundary between the British and Japanese defense forces from south to north. Starting yesterday, residents of the alleys and lanes on Bazilu started migrating again. The cityscape along North Jiangxi Road has become increasingly desolate in recent days, and industrial and commercial operations have suffered severely. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Boundary Markers Added at the Bazilu Intersection</p>
<p>In the area east of North Henan Road in Area A, since the Japanese army took over defense, the Japanese army has automatically erected boundary markers along the various crossroad intersections along North Henan Road from Tianhou Palace Bridge to Bazilu, with the words "Boundary Line of British and Japanese Guarded Area" written on them. However, no boundary marker was erected at the Delong Cigarette Factory north of Bazilu. The Japanese army added a boundary marker to the wall of the cigarette factory the day before yesterday. Many parties are unclear about its intentions. According to sources, the intention of the Japanese army in adding the boundary marker is to completely distinguish the boundary between the British and Japanese defense forces from south to north, and there is no other purpose.</p>
<p>Migration of Residents Intensifies</p>
<p>Bazilu at the end of North Jiangxi Road is less than 100 meters long and has many city houses and lanes. Since the area was changed to a Japanese army guarded area, it has caused panic among the residents, and they have been moving out one after another. At present, there are fewer than 40% of the residents than before. Now that the Japanese army has added boundary markers, it is feared that there will be other unfavorable actions. Therefore, starting yesterday, the migration trend on Bazilu intensified. Until the evening, those carrying suitcases and luggage were still continuously on the road. Everywhere there were notices posted in red paper for renting, selling, and subletting. The feeling was that people were leaving and the buildings were emptying out.</p>
<p>Desolate Cityscape in the Japanese Guarded Area</p>
<p>The area from the northern end of Tianhou Palace Bridge to the end of North Jiangxi Road Bridge to Bazilu has become a Japanese defense force guarded area. Before the defense area changed, the entire cityscape of each section was extremely prosperous, and there were also many residents. Now that it has been changed to Japanese control, the comings and goings of pedestrians are often interfered with, and residents are also subject to searches. Regardless of whether they are people inside or outside the area, all consider the area a dangerous place and are unwilling to enter or leave the area unless necessary. Therefore, the extremely prosperous environment has suddenly turned into a dead city that is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Vehicles Prohibited East of Jiangxi Road</p>
<p>The situation in Area A north of Suzhou Creek is still stagnant. In addition to occasionally re-encrypting and sealing the barbed wire at the Bazilu intersection on North Jiangxi Road, the Japanese do not station sentries. The inspection of passes is stricter when residents pass through the two gaps in Haining Road and Wenshi Road, but there are no searches or interrogations. However, vehicles are prohibited from entering the locked line east of North Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Weather Clears, Rain Stops; Rice Prices Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Continuous Rainy Days Cause Slight Price Increase</p>
<p>Shipments to Shanghai Continuous, No Fear of Shortages</p>
<p>News from the rice shops and tea gatherings: The source of Wuhu national rice has been cleared. Rice shipments to Shanghai from Jiaxing, Kunshan, Tongli, and Nangang are continuous. Yesterday, due to the continuous heavy rain and the difficulty in transporting, the rice market saw a slight rebound in prices of about 5-6 cents. However, according to the rice industry, this was expected and inevitable. If the weather clears and the rain stops, the source can still be transported continuously. At that time, rice prices are expected to continue to fall. It is predicted that粳秈 rice will fall and not rise. The "Temporary Trading Rules" of the rice shop tea market have been implemented. The brokers' shop representatives in the market conduct transactions in accordance with the newly established rules, and are not allowed to buy or sell short. The Rice Industry Trade Association is scheduled to hold a committee meeting at the association's office on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. At that time, two committee members will be appointed to participate in the market mediation committee.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Cargo Cannot Be Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Too Expensive to Transfer from Zhenhai</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou traffic was blocked by the Japanese warships, and foreign vessels were prohibited from entering and exiting, the Ou River navigation was interrupted, resulting in a large number of goods that merchants had previously ordered in Wenzhou and could not be transported to Shanghai being piled up near Aotou. It is planned to transfer them to Shanghai from Zhenhai after the issue of foreign exchange settlement for local goods transported to Shanghai is resolved. However, after a reporter inquired about the results of a certain shipping magnate's inquiry, it was believed that it would be difficult to realize the transfer of goods from Aotou to Shanghai via Zhenhai, because the transportation cost will increase several times, and merchants may not be able to bear it. In addition, although the Portuguese consul has repeatedly negotiated for the release of the twelve Portuguese ships detained by the Japanese, there is still no hope of release. The Japanese have not used the ships and are still detaining them on the Jiangmian near the Yushi Wharf. It is rumored that the Japanese intend to cooperate with the Portuguese merchants, but the main condition for cooperation is to raise the Japanese flag, which the Portuguese consul does not agree to.</p>
<h3>Major Backley Goes to Hong Kong and then Chongqing</h3>
<p>To Handle Relief Work in the Inland</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee held a tea party at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge the night before last to bid farewell to Salvation Army Major Backley. Lin Kanghou, Bao Xuewen, Li Guiyong, Zhao Jinqing, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Zhu Yinjiang, Liu Tingfang, Zhang Lanping, Lu Ganchen, Mao Liqing, and others attended. During the meeting, Chairman Bao Xuewen gave a farewell speech and presented the major with a commemorative flag inscribed with "Helping the Weak and Supporting the Downtrodden" on behalf of the colleagues. It was decided that Lin Kanghou, Mao Liqing, Li Guiyong, Guan Jiongzhi, and others would speak in succession. Finally, Major Backley gave a reply. Major Backley left Shanghai with several of his comrades for Hong Kong yesterday morning and then went to Chongqing to join his comrades in the Yu and Rong areas to continue to handle relief work.</p>
<h3>Ralph Returns Home Today</h3>
<p>Retirement Upon Expiration of Term Has Been Approved</p>
<p>Mr. Ralph, Superintendent of the Police Department, applied to the Public Works Department for retirement last Sunday, as he had been in office for twenty-five and a half years, and the application has been approved by his superiors. Mr. and Mrs. Ralph are scheduled to take a ship to Australia via Japan today. In addition to being publicly entertained by Inspector-General D'Enin and Western detectives on the evening of the 13th, Mr. Ralph has been busy with banquets and farewells in recent days. On the evening of the 16th, he also attended a public farewell banquet by all the members of the Western Shipping Club, and was presented with a silver cigarette case jointly presented by the members and a silver shield from the department as a souvenir by Mr. Mike, the chairman of the club.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenades Found in Empty House</h3>
<p>At No. 506 Bazilu</p>
<p>No. 506 Bazilu at the end of North Henan Road used to be a merchant's shop. Because it was a war zone and faced the barbed wire, it has been closed since the war and no one has moved in to live there. On the afternoon of the 16th, at about 3:00 PM, the storm and rain blew down the row of doors. Suddenly, it was discovered that there were sandbag fortifications piled up inside the doors, and a hand grenade was conspicuously placed on the sandbags. Although the door faces Area A north of Suzhou Creek, it is blocked by barbed wire, so the Japanese have not yet discovered it. As of yesterday, the hand grenade was still placed in its original position. If children were ignorant and accidentally triggered it, it would be very dangerous.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Shipping Almost Entirely Seized</h3>
<p>Most of the foreign merchants' North China shipping has been seized. Since Tianjin and Gu were blockaded, and then the flood caused a disaster, shipping was completely suspended. At the beginning of last month, the flood receded. Due to the lack of food in Tianjin, flour and groceries were shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin, and transportation slightly recovered. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, the Baihe barges were incited by someone and went on strike, which has not been resolved. As a result, the cargo transport of foreign merchants has been hit again. The two British ships, Yuezhou and Hunan, left for Tianjin the day before yesterday (the 16th). Except for the Yuezhou ship, which was loaded with 70 boxes of beer and more than 100 pieces of cigarettes from the British-American Tobacco Company, there was no other cargo. The Hunan ship had a little Yantai cargo, but no Tianjin cargo at all. The Japanese ship Tangshan Maru will export to Tianjin this afternoon, fully loaded with passengers and cargo. Since Japanese ships can go directly to the Tianjin Wharf, many pieces of cargo are reported. In this situation, the future of the transportation of foreign merchant ships sailing on the North China Sea route is really unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Police Inspection Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Mr. Fan Keling, Chairman of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, believes that as winter is approaching, the defense of this city must be strengthened to maintain security within the concession and protect public tranquility. In order to understand the police force of the various police stations under his jurisdiction, the original overall inspection of all police personnel, scheduled for 11:00 AM on the 19th of this month, has been rescheduled to November 5th due to venue reasons. It will still be held at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, all police officers of all ranks and all Chinese and Indian constables will participate in the inspection, and members of the Chinese and Western Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and senior officials stationed in Shanghai from various countries will be invited to observe and accompany the inspection.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Collecting Cocoons Ambushed by Guerrillas; Trapped in a Small Farmhouse for Fifteen Hours; Two Dead and Three Wounded in the Puppet Pacification Corps</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Ta Mei Evening News," three Japanese merchants, 13 Chinese soldiers from the Pacification Corps, and 5 Japanese soldiers were surrounded by Chinese guerrillas in a small farmhouse near Suzhou in the Changshu area at the end of last month. After fifteen hours, reinforcements arrived to relieve the siege. Two members of the Pacification Corps died, three were wounded, and one was missing. The three Japanese merchants were employees of the Changshu branch of the China Silk Company. On September 26, they went to Huangzhuang (transliteration), northwest of Changshu, to purchase cocoons. They were accompanied by 30 soldiers from the Pacification Corps and 50 Japanese soldiers stationed in Yangjianzhen, south of Huangzhuang. However, after the purchase in Huangzhuang was completed, 17 soldiers from the Pacification Corps returned to defend first. While on their way back, they were suddenly attacked by guerrillas shortly after noon. Fighting immediately broke out. The guerrillas were more numerous, and the group of Japanese and others finally took refuge in a farmhouse. The guerrillas pursued them and attacked the farmhouse with machine guns and hand grenades. The Japanese and others defended to the death. By 6:00 AM the next morning, reinforcements arrived, and the guerrillas withdrew.</p>
<h3>British China Relief Fund: Two-Year Work Report (1)</h3>
<p>Fund Launch</p>
<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, many British men and women felt compelled to take action to alleviate the great suffering of numerous refugees. On August 28th of that year, the Joint Committee of the British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association discussed this issue and sent a telegram to London, urging the establishment of a refugee relief fund in London. In September, further steps were taken to promote this cause, and in early October, the launch of the fund was announced. The China Association (an organization formed by those with commercial interests in China), the British Red Cross, and the Conference of British Missionary Societies (representing various British Protestant church groups) resolved in London to establish a joint committee. In October of the same year, they officially</p>
<p>Began Solicitation</p>
<p>to raise the "Lord Mayor of London's Fund for Relief of Distress in China." The Lord Mayor of London provided assistance, and it was quickly discovered that sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people was widespread. Local committees had been established in various cities and towns in conjunction with the Lord Mayor of London's Fund. These committees were established in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, and other places, mostly with the local mayor serving as chairman or actively supporting them. A committee for the collection and dispatch of clothing and medicine had also been established in London.</p>
<p>Subcommittee</p>
<p>British shipping companies such as Blue Funnel, Ben Line, Glen Line, and Shire Line all provided free transportation of all medicines and clothing. After the fund had been operating for more than a year, the Lord Mayor's Fund ended, so while the "Lord Mayor of London's Fund" was often mentioned, it was no longer able to be referred to by that name. Instead, fundraising continued under the name "British China Relief Fund." Following the recent outbreak of the European War, the British Foundation announced that it would continue its efforts. The total amount raised was 202,000 pounds, which was quite</p>
<p>Inspiring</p>
<p>A central administrative committee has been established in China to handle the work. The director of the committee is the British Ambassador and the Governor of Hong Kong, who are actively concerned about this charitable work. The chairman is Sir Philip, the British Consul-General, and the vice-chairman is Sir Marshall, the chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce. Despite their busy official duties, they have devoted their time for the past two years, working diligently with other members of the committee. Subcommittees chaired by the British Consul-General or Consul have been established in Tianjin, Qingdao, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, and Hong Kong, while</p>
<p>Yichang and Xi'an</p>
<p>have also organized local committees. These subcommittees report their needs and the funds they receive to the central administrative committee in Shanghai. The central administrative committee then distributes the funds and supplies to agencies that directly manage refugee camps and hospitals for the wounded, such as the International Red Cross, churches of different denominations and nationalities, and the Salvation Army. The central administrative committee has four subcommittees to handle the work related to Chinese refugees, hospital supplies, injured British citizens, and injured people of various nationalities. Hong Kong has a committee for the distribution of medicines. In the past two years, the central administrative committee has met regularly and has hardly turned a deaf ear to appeals for assistance.</p>
<p>Dispatch of Materials: The Sheffield Stainless Steel Manufacturers' Association donated stainless steel knives and scissors worth 1,000 pounds. Major British pharmaceutical manufacturers donated anesthetics, medicines, clothing, and food. A certain trading company donated cotton cloth. From January 15th to August 17th, 1939, fifty shipments of materials arrived in Hong Kong from the UK, including clothing, hospital supplies, blankets, linen, soap, disinfectants, bandages, first aid kits, milk, food, medicine, mosquito nets, kettles, etc., packed in a total of 3,119 cases, packages, and boxes, worth several thousand pounds. Unpacking and redistributing these supplies in Shanghai and Hong Kong took a lot of time. A large quantity of medical supplies was also purchased in China and sent to various hospitals. In April 1939, malaria spread in Hankou, and the stock of quinine was dwindling. The British Fund provided assistance by immediately transporting quinine to Hankou. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>"De Yao" Wheel Has Been Officially Detained</h3>
<p>The Japanese side handed over the navy for handling</p>
<p>The Japanese flag was raised yesterday morning</p>
<p>The "De Yao" wheel, represented by the Portuguese merchant Yihua Foreign Company, was detained by the Japanese naval police. Although the Portuguese Consul-General and the wheel authorities negotiated, there was once news that it could be released and resumed sailing. However, after many days, it has not been implemented. Now the company feels that the detention has caused huge losses and urgently needs to find a reasonable solution to resume business as soon as possible. It is heard that the Japanese side has handed over this matter to the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai for handling, so the future of negotiations is even more difficult. According to the reporter of Daguang News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry, the "De Yao" wheel was officially detained by the Japanese Navy authorities at 10:30 yesterday morning. The Portuguese flag on the ship has been removed and replaced with the Japanese flag. According to the Japanese Navy, the nationality of the wheel has been verified and is entirely owned by Chinese merchants, so it is officially detained. It is heard that from today, the wheel will be moved to the Yangshupu floating hole and moored with the detained Portuguese wheels. According to Daguang News Agency, the sudden investigation and detention of the "De Yao" wheel was entirely caused by the manipulation of Italian merchants.</p>
<h3>Puppet Drama: Fake Police Suffering</h3>
<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" stated that yesterday (the 16th), Xiao'an celebrated the anniversary of the "establishment of the municipal government." In the afternoon, there were many Dadao police and marchers outside Zhaofeng Park, standing in the wind and rain, looking very frustrated. According to a Dadao policeman, "We have not been issued raincoats, nor can we afford to buy them ourselves, because we only get sixteen yuan a month." According to one of the marchers, "I am a firm</p>
<p>Supporter of Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>You should know why I am doing this." It is understood that these marchers are all workers from the Hongkou and Yangshupu yarn factories. The Japanese threatened them that if they did not participate in the celebration, they would be dismissed. The Japanese also promised to give each participant one yuan after returning to the north bank of the Suzhou River. Yesterday, after these people participated in the Jiangwan celebration, they took trucks to leave, but many were blocked by the police station at</p>
<p>Sichuan Road Bridge.</p>
<p>Only six trucks crossed the bridge and drove through the Public Concession to Zhaofeng Park, and a large number of tickets had already been purchased, obviously well-planned, intending to have the workers march in Zhaofeng Park, and a large number of Dadao police had also</p>
<p>Stationed outside the park.</p>
<p>However, the Public Works Department's police department had sent plainclothes personnel to guard in front of the park, so the march could not take place. However, the workers and Dadao police had no raincoats and stood in the rain, their clothes all wet.</p>
<h3>Muslims Begin Fasting Yesterday</h3>
<p>No eating or drinking during the day</p>
<p>Reflect on oneself and consider one's faults in free time</p>
<p>There are more than 70,000 Muslims in this city. Every year in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, they must fast (commonly known as keeping Zhai) for a month. Yesterday was the second day of the ninth month of the Islamic year 1358, which is the day when Muslims all over the world began fasting. Muslims in this city all began fasting from yesterday. The teachings stipulate that during the fasting period, eating and drinking are prohibited every day from the time the eastern horizon brightens to the time the sun sets. One should only eat and drink after sunset. In addition to managing one's life, one should pray in the church and reflect on oneself and consider one's faults. Every night at seven o'clock, Muslims gather in nearby churches to pray, and the church leaders preach Islamic doctrines. Last night, a "Green Flag" monthly magazine, issued by Muslims, was distributed to Muslims in various churches, and the situation was quite enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Women's Clothing Industry Strike Deadlocked After Mediation Fails; Labor Demands 100% Wage Increase, Employers Plan to Hire New Workers by Publishing an Advertisement</h3>
<p>More than 300 women's clothing workers in the Western-style clothing industry began a strike on the afternoon of the 11th because their demand for a 100% wage increase was not met. Although both sides sent representatives to mediate, the conditions were too far apart, resulting in a stalemate. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Strike in effect</p>
<p>More than 300 women's clothing workers in the Western-style clothing industry, citing the increase in the cost of living in Shanghai, submitted a demand to the employers on the 11th of this month for a 100% wage increase. The employers believed that although there have been wage increases in various industries in Shanghai, there has been no precedent for a 100% increase, so they only agreed to a 20% increase (i.e., an increase of five corners for each piece under two yuan). The labor side replied that this was too far from the conditions they had proposed, so they went on strike.</p>
<p>Stalemate</p>
<p>Since the strike, the labor side has appointed Yang Baoshan, Weng Liangsheng, and Chen Xiaodao as representatives. After being recognized by the employers, they held a mediation meeting at the Pengjili Guild Hall at 1 pm on the 15th. Qi Fang sent Lin Zhengren and others to attend. The labor side still insisted on the condition of a 100% wage increase. The reason they gave was that five Western-style clothing stores had already accepted this condition. However, the employers believed that these five were not legitimate stores and could not be cited as examples. Moreover, there was no precedent for a 100% wage increase in various industries in Shanghai. The current offer of a 20% increase can be considered fair. The two sides remained at a stalemate. Although another mediation meeting was held on the 16th, there were no results.</p>
<p>Employers' measures</p>
<p>After the mediation broke down, the guild immediately sent a letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association, reporting the course of the strike and future measures. It also published an announcement that all women's clothing Western-style clothing stores had temporarily appointed Chen Qingtang as general affairs, Xu Xiaotang as finance, Zhang Wenxing as secretary, and Du and Dai to be responsible for recruiting new workers. Workers who are willing to comply with the employer's 20% wage increase (i.e., an increase of five corners for each coat under two yuan) can resume work as before. Those who still insist on a 100% wage increase will be dismissed.</p>
<p>Raw materials skyrocket</p>
<p>The industry guild is divided into two parts: men's clothing and women's clothing. There are more than 200 members in the men's clothing industry and 20 in the women's clothing industry. There are more than 3,000 workers in the men's clothing industry and more than 300 in the women's clothing industry. Since the outbreak of the European War, raw materials have soared, and the purchasing power of the Shanghai market has also decreased compared to before, resulting in a sluggish business. The average monthly income of workers in this industry is said to be more than 60 yuan. Last November, there was also a strike, which was settled because the employers agreed to increase wages by 20%. Now, unfortunately, this type of event has occurred again, which is not only detrimental to both labor and management, but also inconvenient for customers who order new clothes because they cannot try on new clothes in time.</p>

<h3>The customs detains German goods stored by Chinese merchants in Haiphong; after negotiations, they have been approved for release; the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requests an extension of the registration deadline, which cannot be completed before the 25th of this month</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of German goods stored by Chinese merchants in Haiphong, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Haiphong at the request of the Chinese merchants. The telegram stated, (1) To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing, according to the Xiyanliao Industry Association, the Yanliao products produced by the German Defu Foreign Firm, which was handled by the Sichuan Gang, were transported through Haiphong. Because there were no vehicles to transport them, they were stored in warehouses. Now the Haiphong authorities regard them as enemy goods and detain them, damaging the capital of Chinese merchants. Please rescue them and urge the Ministry to investigate and quickly telegraph the Haiphong authorities to negotiate the release of the merchant goods owned by neutral third countries. Nothing is more important. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Xi. (2) To Consul Liu of the Chinese Consulate in Haiphong, we are grateful for your efforts to negotiate the release of German goods stored by Chinese merchants in Haiphong. According to a letter from merchants here, the Haiphong government has set a deadline of October 25th. The deadline is too tight. There are many procedures for handling certificates in Shanghai, and it is difficult to complete them in time. We urge you to negotiate with the Haiphong authorities to extend the deadline to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. We look forward to your reply. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Xi. It is heard that in addition to sending a telegram, the Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the Shanghai French Consulate General to facilitate the issuance of certificates.</p>
<h3>In the Pingwang Lane Shooting Case, a Prostitute Died Tragically; Bodyguards Should Be Held Responsible; The Murderer Escaped, and the Two Bodyguards Were Detained for Recklessly Shooting and Manslaughter and Sent to the Court for Investigation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Dingshi from Wuxing, Zhejiang, resides at 86 Shigaota Road, Hongkou. He is currently the director and general manager of the Huimin Milk Powder Company. Recently, he has been favored by the Japanese and appointed as the director of the Public Works Bureau of the "Shanghai Municipal Government." Therefore, Li immediately resigned from all positions in Huimin Company in the newspaper to</p>
<p>Take office.</p>
<p>In order to prevent accidents, he hired Hu Changhai (45 years old) and Zhang Lianzhong (24 years old) from Hubei as bodyguards. At 9 pm on the 14th of this month, Li set up a feast at the Meijuan brothel in Pingwang Lane 26, Pingwang Street, inviting guests including Ikeda Seiichi, a consultant of the fake "Municipal Government," Kita Shoichi, a consultant of the fake "Finance Bureau," Sasaki, the head of the special affairs agency, Wang Changchun, a fake "Municipal Government Councilor," and Dong Ming, a director of the fake "China Automobile Company." At the time, it was</p>
<p>A joyous banquet</p>
<p>When suddenly three strong men went upstairs and went straight into Li's room. Each took out a pistol and fired more than a dozen shots in succession. At that time, Ikeda was shot in the face and Kita in the waist. Dong Ming jumped out of the building in a hurry and was also injured. Li, Wang Changchun, and Sasaki avoided the disaster by lying on the ground. At that time, Li's bodyguards Hu Changhai and Zhang Lianzhong were both in the hall downstairs. Suddenly hearing frequent gunshots upstairs, they knew something was wrong. Instead of</p>
<p>Guarding the stairs,</p>
<p>they hid in the downstairs wing room. When they saw the assassins go downstairs and escape through the back door, they each took out a gun and fired from the window. As a result, the assassins all escaped safely, but they shot and killed a prostitute, Xiao Qiaohong (aka Shen Sanbao), in the throat. At the same time, Sun Changyu, the chauffeur of Huang Ruisong, the manager of the Tonghai Trust Company, who was parked in Pingwang Lane, was also injured by stray bullets. After the old patrol room was notified, he immediately ordered Chinese detective Wang Shusen and detective Zhang Bingchun to</p>
<p>Investigate.</p>
<p>The assassins had all escaped without a trace. It was determined that Li's bodyguards Hu and Zhang should have been guarding the entrance of the staircase, in which case the assassins would not have been able to escape. However, they hid in the wing room and fired recklessly, causing the prostitute Xiao Qiaohong to die tragically. They should be held responsible for the negligence. Therefore, Hu and Zhang</p>
<p>Were detained</p>
<p>and sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The patrol room lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the process, saying that the case still needs to be investigated, so he requested a change of date for review. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xieffen, the two defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody and the trial was rescheduled. After Xiao Qiaohong Sanbao was shot and killed, Sanbao's mother learned of the situation and negotiated with the fake "officials." As a result, Li Dingshi was responsible for all the funeral arrangements for the prostitute, and also paid a loss fee of one thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Waste Copper and Iron: The Ringleader Arrested</h3>
<p>Repeated offenses, trial adjourned</p>
<p>At around 5 am on the 16th (the day before yesterday), Patrolman No. 446 dispatched by the French Patrol Department was patrolling near the wire fence at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road. He caught a glimpse of a man moving old copper and scrap iron from the Chinese Concession to the French Concession, so he stepped forward to arrest him. The man immediately took out five yuan in banknotes, intending to bribe him, but was rejected by the patrolman. He was taken to the patrol room and identified as Gao Guisheng (37 years old, from Qingjiang). After investigation, it was found that Gao was a well-known leader of a thief gang who had repeatedly committed crimes such as robbery and murder in the French Concession and had been wanted. He was transferred to the Second Criminal Court yesterday, where Judge Miao presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The patrol room said that the defendant had committed repeated offenses and still needed to be investigated, so it requested an extension. The court, after reviewing the case, ordered the trial to be rescheduled for the 26th of this month, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>On the Anhui Ship, Male and Female Abductors Were Arrested and Three Children Were Found</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 14th of this month, the French Patrol Department, based on informant reports, said that the Anhui ship was moored at Pier 2 of the Bund Taikoo and was about to sail to Macau. There were male and female abductors in the steerage of the ship. Detective Shen Jinshu, Yao Zhupo, detective Zhong Benchang, Jiang Yiyong, Xu Fuming, etc. were dispatched to</p>
<p>Board the ship to arrest them.</p>
<p>As expected, the ringleader Zhang Qingxiang (also known as Zhang Xianglang, 33 years old, from Chongming, residing at 248 Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road) and Zhang's mistress Zhang Xiuzhen, also known as Lu Sunshi (36 years old, from Haining), and Xue Wangshi (also known as Wang Guiying, 26 years old, from Chongming, residing at 530 Kangti Road) were arrested on the ship, and three boys were found, one named Shunfa, 11 years old, one named A Jin, 7 years old, and one named A Da, 5 years old. They were all</p>
<p>Taken to the patrol room.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Qingxiang, after abducting the children, he hid them in a bungalow at Xiaohua Bridge at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Columbia Road. Zhang Xiuzhen hired Xue Wangshi to accompany the children to Macau. When they were arrested, Xue Wangshi was sleeping in the quilt with the children. According to Xue Wangshi, she was introduced to Zhang by her maternal aunt Jin to accompany the children, receiving</p>
<p>A reward of 30 yuan</p>
<p>each time. Subsequently, the patrol room sent detectives to 530 Kangti Road to arrest Jin, but she had already fled after hearing the news. Only passports and children's clothes were found. The detectives waited at Jin's house and arrested Wang Ruiqi (41 years old, from Chongming). They were all sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday, where the handling detective Zhong Benchang reported on the</p>
<p>Course of the case.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the patrol room requested an extension of the investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang briefly questioned them and ordered the trial to be rescheduled for the 26th. The children were temporarily sent to Guangci Hospital for foster care, pending family members to claim them.</p>
<h3>Unchaste, Accuses Husband of Assault, Sentenced to 40 Days of Detention</h3>
<p>Kuang Baolian (27 years old this year), the wife of Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai City Market in Nanshi, was recently sued for assault by his mistress Cheng Meifang (20 years old this year, from Hankou, the daughter of Cheng Chen, a woman who had been sentenced by the Second Special Court for fraud involving jewelry, etc.) to the French Concession Patrol Room, and was prosecuted by the Patrol Room to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for the crime of assault. The case was tried in the Criminal</p>
<p>Eighth Court yesterday by Judge Zhu Chuzhe.</p>
<p>The defendant Kuang Baolian hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to appear in court to defend him. First, lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case based on the accusation of the accuser Cheng Meifang. Judge Zhu then questioned the defendant Kuang Baolian based on this. According to Kuang, "I have been living with Cheng Meifang for six years. At first, we were introduced by a friend and were initially at peace. She (referring to Cheng Meifang) has given me two children, one of whom died prematurely, and the other is four years old this year. After the war, I</p>
<p>Was once unemployed.</p>
<p>Although I have recently been working at the Jiangxi Road American Wireless Company, my monthly salary is only 40 yuan. I give her all my monthly salary, but I still can't satisfy her. Her mother and brothers live in the Meiren Lane on Hankou Road. The house there is my father's property and doesn't require rent. It is possible to maintain life with my monthly income without freezing or starving. Unexpectedly, she has other plans and often quarrels, and she often comes back at twelve o'clock at night, or even</p>
<p>Doesn't return all night.</p>
<p>About three months ago, I took my four-year-old child to my parents' residence at 698 Lane 9, Pushi Road, for temporary residence, hoping she would repent. Later, she asked lawyer Fan Gang to write a letter, saying that I had abandoned her. On the first of this month, I met her on Aiduya Road and took her to Pushi Road, hoping to live together. Unexpectedly, she still quarreled willfully. No one beat her. She went out again by herself. The next day, she called to threaten me and then led the patrol room to call me</p>
<p>To the patrol room. She said that I beat her, which is really clear. The court also questioned the accuser Cheng Meifang. According to Cheng, "I have been married to Kuang Baolian for six or seven years. In the beginning, the feelings between the two sexes were very strong, but in recent years I have suffered abuse. This time I was beaten and injured, so I had no choice but to sue." The court asked if they were officially married, and Cheng gave vague answers. Although she said they were married, she could not say the date. The court said to Cheng, "If you sue for abandonment, you are a person with the ability to save yourself. If you want living expenses, you</p>
<p>Cannot prove</p>
<p>that you are officially married. In the opinion of this court, it is better not to litigate and still have hope of living together." Cheng still said that she wanted to sue Kuang Baolian for assault. After the court ordered the debate, it sentenced Kuang Baolian to 40 days of detention for injuring another person's body, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. After hearing the sentence, Kuang Baolian declared in court that he would not accept it and decided to appeal.</p>
<h3>Robbers Rampant in the Hongqiao District, Robbing Dozens of Families in One Night</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao District in western Shanghai has recently been rife with robbers, and robberies are frequently heard. For example, Gu Youyu and Gu Chen, the victims of burns in Gujiatang, and Li Ada, a woman who was beaten to death, have made villagers turn pale at the mention of it and dare not live in their homes. Last night (15th), in the middle of the night, Sun Genglang of Xunanli in Hongqiao Town, and the home of Sun Liansheng, the former local protector, were also visited by a large number of robbers, more than 20 people. They divided into groups and went to more than 20 families of Sun's clan, including Sun Genyao, Sun Adong, Sun Afa, Sun Quanhai, Sun Jiantang, and Sun Yousheng, Sun Atu, Sun Asheng in Nantai, and many people were beaten and injured. At the same time, Shigenglang, Zhujiamuqiao, Zhangjiata, and three villages in the north of Hongqiao Town (south of Hongqiao Road, McLaugh Road) were also robbed by another group of robbers. It is heard that more than 30 families were robbed, and the losses are unknown. However, Zhou Dianqing of Zhujiamuqiao, Xu Liutang of Shigenglang, and Zhang Zhangsheng of Zhangjiata were severely beaten and injured by the robbers, and their lives are in danger.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Tense Scene</h3>
<p>— One Without</p>
<p>After passing through the defense zone of two foreign gatekeepers, it felt like falling into an area of heat haze and a cacophony of voices. Wiping the water droplets from my hair and face, I began to forget that outside on the road, there was a somber autumn rain and a world of muddy sludge.</p>
<p>Squeezing through the throng of people to the stands, it happened that this round of gambling was about to decide its final fate. Six Russians wearing red jerseys pushed six numbered dogs into iron cages. The starter waved a white flag lightly, and a mechanical rabbit sped from the opposite side of the track. Then, six dogs, like arrows released from a bowstring, chased after the target. Originally, people's attitudes were so relaxed and leisurely: smoking cigarettes, leaning on wicker chairs drinking tea, discussing which dog would run first on which day. But at this moment, it was different. Everyone stood up, stretching their necks, watching the twenty-four scurrying dog legs in the arena, silently reciting the number they had bought, eyes fixed on the position and order of the dog. A bespectacled gentleman near me exclaimed happily: "Ah! Number two!" But number two dog was really disappointing, colliding with number six when turning, smoothly allowing numbers five and one to chase ahead. The gentleman was so angry that, without waiting for the referee's red and green light report, he had already torn the ticket to shreds, throwing it into the air, and the money had already flown into someone else's pocket.</p>
<p>This thirty-second tense situation can cause a person's heart to stop beating and feel the suffocation of depression.</p>
<p>Returning to the gentle ticket-buying room. In the crowd, I felt the embarrassment of insignificance. Many people's eyes were watching me, despising me, as if saying, "Poor kid, what makes you think you deserve to be here? So pathetic!" The police officer gave me a meaningful look, and a poster on the wall read, "Beware of Pickpockets," as if it were meant for me.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is where wealthy Chinese gentlemen come to change their tastes after playing with women and tiring of mahjong; watching dog races is not a method of amusement on a secluded island. But one question arises before me: I find that half of those who gamble are not really rich; they are harboring a psychology of luck and greed.</p>
<p>At this time, I paid attention to everyone's actions:</p>
<p>In a dark corner, there was a very thin man with eyes sunken in deep sockets, looking like he hadn't had enough opium, pulling out a record book of past dog races and comparing it with today's program. He was so focused that he didn't even notice the cigarette butt burning his fingers.</p>
<p>Two people were having a humorous conversation. The first one said, "You didn't listen to me, not buying number five, Yellow Lion Hoof." Another said, "Wasn't number two very good? If it hadn't been for the fight, it would have definitely run first—it's really infuriating, I wish I could run for it!"</p>
<p>In the bar, a very fat man, with a cigar clipped between his fingers, was shaking his head, calling for a boy to collect the winnings. The boy brought a large stack of bills, but a pair of clean white hands gently pressed down on them. She nimbly took a five-yuan bill and gave it to the boy, then familiarly put the rest into her wallet, a foxy smile on her face. The big guy said, "What does this matter!"</p>
<p>"Don't show off, just go back; if you don't have enough capital, you'll definitely lose," such a voice came from behind me. I was too embarrassed to turn around and look at them immediately. Running a little further, it seemed to be employees of a small shop, an older one talking to a younger one.</p>
<p>The time had come. I was mixed in the crowd, my mind gripped by the chaotic and messy black hand. This is a world forgotten by war, without hunger, without suffering, only the laughter of prostitution, people chewing bone marrow triumphantly, and...</p>
<h3>A Sound Physique and a Sound Mind</h3>
<p>The neon lights of the Great World's advertising sign shone on the center of the street, causing every passerby to raise their heads in a hurry, casting envious glances. The dancing bee seemed like a silkworm spinning silk, diligently weaving winter clothing for people.</p>
<p>"This year's wool yarn is too expensive to afford!"</p>
<p>In the crowd, who let out such a heavy sigh: "Too expensive to afford" pierced everyone's heart like an arrow—just when they had taken a breath from the heavy burden of rice prices at forty yuan per dan, they had to worry anxiously about winter clothes for the whole family "in the autumn wind."</p>
<p>On the other side illuminated by the neon lights, there was a long row of clean glass windows, inside displaying even more dazzling items: a fawn immersed in medicinal liquid; two beautiful antlers; ginseng branches packed in brocade boxes; and... in short, "tonics."</p>
<p>Yes, while most people were worried about being "unable to fend off the cold," some felt it was time for "timely nourishment."</p>
<p>Those who labor all year round, running around for food and clothing, indeed feel the panic of life when rice rises to forty yuan per dan; they sigh deeply when wool yarn is too expensive to afford. However, their bodies, tempered by wind, frost, rain, and snow, do not need the exquisite tonics displayed in the glass windows. At the same time, it will not arouse that kind of extravagant desire, hoping to taste something different, because they already have a strong physique.</p>
<p>But what about those noble people who are worshiped like fresh flowers in greenhouses? They grow up in unclean air, and their enjoyment is also depriving them of their health. So when they feel physically weak, they want to make up for it with "tonics." But they don't know that "food nourishment is better than medicinal nourishment." Doctors also instruct patients to maintain their health by exercising, breathing fresh air, and eating more nutritious food. So taking tonics is not a kind of "enjoyment," but "curing illness." But who can pay attention to the incubation period of their illness beforehand? On the contrary, they indulge in sensual pleasures and accelerate the decline of their bodies—at this time, "tonics" may have already lost their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Similarly, to cultivate a sound spirit, one must pay attention to the incubation period of the disease beforehand and "cure the disease" afterward, just like tempering a sound physique. Various industrial, commercial, educational, and charitable organizations in this city, "seeing that the morals of the world are declining day by day, and that a sense of integrity and shame is being lost, so much so that even people with status and reputation in society are disregarding integrity and shame, and are obsessed with power and benefits, shamelessly serving their enemies," have initiated a movement to promote integrity and shame. Being "obsessed with power and benefits" is like people worshiped in greenhouses being deceived by "enjoyment," resulting in physical weakness and the need for timely nourishment. The measures set by the movement to promote integrity and shame: (1) Vowing not to participate in shameless undertakings and not to accept shameless money; (2) Jointly condemning shameless people with words and writings, without any favoritism, are precisely the right medicine for the incubation period of the disease.

<p>To the Editor: I have just read the account of the examination for radio operators in your column on October 6th, which exposed the fact that "XX Wireless Electric Specialty School" is falsely recruiting people and making fun of young people. I am very impressed with the righteous call! However, there is more than one wireless electric school in Shanghai that specializes in fighting for fame. Your newspaper is kind and benevolent, and hides its name; but because Zeng Shen killed someone, the innocent are suffering. I am writing to you to request that you publish the real name of the school in order to set things straight!</p>
<p>Sanji Wireless Electric Specialty School</p>
<p>Your school's request to publish the real name of the school to set things straight is certainly appropriate. However, since our newspaper was kind and benevolent before, why should we expose the school afterward? However, what you call XX refers to another school, and it is definitely not referring to your school. I am writing a few words to relieve your concerns.

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Establish a Medical School to Train Scholars, Thinking About Expanding the Village Governance and Entrusting Children to Care For</p>
<p>This is because he started early, knowing that there would be a need for this kind of thing everywhere in the future, and he had already prepared for it. This is what Village Chief Zhu called a speculative enterprise. Even so, relying solely on speculation is useless, and the spleen is also very important. Because the seedlings supplied by Freedom Village are carefully selected, he has invited specialists to study and investigate them, and has also written many detailed explanations, which are indeed different from others. Later, the number of people coming to ask for them increased day by day, and the nursery they ran also became wider and wider. Fortunately, this nursery is constantly innovating, sending out a large number of well-planted seedlings and adding a large number of new ones, turning all the mountain land into nurseries. Once this trend started, the villagers of Zhongcun did not allow even an inch of space under the shade of the walls or three bows of land by the fence to be empty, and they would definitely find a way to plant a few saplings. A young student, under the shade of the willow behind his house, surrounded by a small bamboo fence, would pull his little classmates after school to see the trees he had planted. These nurseries are a relatively large source of income for Freedom Village, and Village Chief Zhu is very interested in them. Now, they are also trying to plant many precious seedlings collected from abroad. In addition to the nurseries, the output of several collectively-run village farms is also not small. They also have collectively-run village livestock farms, village transport companies, and village buses. In short, the annual income is also very generous. If there are any special expenses, they can also borrow village bonds, and some people also donate to the village. However, Village Chief Zhu and the people in charge of the village all live within their means. They would rather postpone things that can be postponed, believing in the method of gradual progress. As long as the foundation is established, they are not afraid that Freedom Village will not prosper in the future. However, Village Chief Zhu and the others always keep a close eye on education and health, and cannot ignore them. So today, he discussed the matter of the nursery with his lover. Several townships in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already established nurseries, and Freedom Village has also proposed it before. Although Freedom Village cannot have a well-organized infant care home like Anle Town, a nursery seems to be essential. Having one can be extended to having several, which is our next generation's business, what is called the masters of the future. What will the next generation do? How much will they progress? We don't know at all at the moment, but we must prepare everything for them. This is the duty of our previous generation. We have also received the kindness of the previous generation, and we will repay our next generation in return. The world continues to be inherited in this way. It is true:</p>
<p>Do not say that the new and old have metabolism.</p>
<p>You must know that cultures promote each other. (192) He Nake made</p>

<h3>Kun Opera Will Not Decline</h3>
<p>— Oddball</p>
<p>Success depends on human effort; may enthusiasts rise up together!</p>
<p>Kun Opera is the ancestor of Chinese opera and the earliest developed form of drama. It has excellent scripts, excellent music, and extremely delicate expressions. After thinking about it, it should not decline no matter what! Just like the sun will never come out from the west!</p>
<p>But why is it so depressed now? The reason is very simple, it is the four words "human effort not exhausted." I have already explained this very thoroughly in my White and Red Studio Drama Talk in this publication last year. Not striving will lead to decline, is the universal truth of natural selection. Have you ever seen anyone in the world succeed without struggling? Whether it is Hitler, Shaw, or even Chaplin, Mei Lanfang, none of them have not put in a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>Kun Opera first appeared as a hall theater, and its history is at least two hundred years old. However, in the meantime, I can frankly say that it has simply never been improved. It is truly a matter of closing the door and guarding itself. It is a great fluke to be able to barely survive to this day!</p>
<p>"Reviving Kun Opera," this question has been circling in my mind for a full five years. Whenever I have time, I bury my head in writing plans and constantly research and consult with people related to all parties. Now I can boldly say that if my plan can be implemented, it will be of great help to the revival of Kun Opera.</p>
<p>Because I have always been against "talking on paper" and hate "scholars rebelling, failing in three years," I don't want to say more here (so as not to cause many unnecessary debates). As for the motivation for writing this article, it is sincerely to find a few people who are willing to cooperate (note that the scope of cooperation is to do real work, not to hold symposiums or debates). If there are comrades who love Kun Opera and have considerable financial resources, just write a letter to me (send it to the editorial department of this publication), and I will definitely visit you immediately.</p>
<p>Random Notes of an Artist</p>
<h3>The Early Chinese Martial Arts Star, Fan Xuepeng, Who Improved Civilized Drama</h3>
<p>— Yunmen</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng, who abandoned the life of silver screen glamour, is now a popular figure at the "Green Treasure Theater."</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago, during the "golden age" of martial arts films, Miss Fan completed her debut in "Thirteen Sisters" at "Youlian," and since then, Fan Xuepeng's name has become familiar to everyone on the early Chinese silver screen.</p>
<p>However, gradually, from "Youlian" to "Tianyi," this "martial arts star" changed her style after all. That is to say, she was discovered by the directors to have a natural talent for acting in tragedies, so "Ren Zhu" made her once again attract the attention of the silver screen.</p>
<p>Before August 13th, she was a basic actor of Yihua Film Company. "A Pearl in the Palm" was a famous ethical film, and Fan Xuepeng was the most successful in grasping the character's personality in the play. However, from that time on, the war made her jump out of the film circle, and "A Pearl in the Palm" was her last work. Her occasional theatrical career actually began at the "Dahua Theater." Under the direction of Wu Wei, she played the role of Guan Xiugu in "A Marriage to Laugh and Cry," which swept millions of audiences in Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Changsha, and Shanghai, and lasted for a full year.</p>
<p>She received a lot of help from her husband, Wen Yimin, at "Youlian." After the war, she once performed at the Great China Drama Theater, and was hired by "Green Treasure" three months later. She has been there for more than a year now.</p>
<p>Now, she has partners with the same "improved civilized drama" interests as Gu Menghu, Chen Qiufeng, and Tian Xin, etc., she said heavily.</p>
<p>"I have traveled half of China. I understand that drama is only a link in education. Seeing the level of audiences in various counties and cities in the mainland, I really have to sigh at those drama workers who specialize in touting "slogans," only going their own way to win over the very few "masses" who have "already received education." Therefore, I resolutely jumped onto the stage."</p>
<p>Her original name is Yao Xiongfei, she is thirty years old this year, and she is from Yixing, Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Private Life (Four)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>—Random Memories of Mei, Six—</p>
<p>Family Situation</p>
<p>His family is very simple. Besides his wife, Madam Fu Zhifang, there are three sons and one daughter. The eldest son is named Bao Chen, fifteen years old. The second is Bao Zhen, thirteen. The third daughter is Bao Yue, ten years old. The youngest is named Bao Jiu, six years old. All four are in school. In their spare time at home, they also hire Chinese and English teachers for tutoring. Mr. Mei urges them to study very strictly! All four have good natural endowments. Judging from their temperament and ambition, the eldest son wants to be a pilot or study mechanical engineering. The second son understands things and has a clear plan in mind, if he doesn't study law, he will study medicine. The third daughter is gentle and inclined to literature. The youngest son is more intelligent than ordinary children, and his appearance is very much like his father. The one who will be able to continue Mr. Mei's mantle in the future must be this son. Although he is young, he likes music the most. When he was four or five years old, he could distinguish several dozen records placed together, whose record it was and what play was being sung. As soon as the phonograph played, he would know what play it was and who was singing it. Even if it was the same "Escorting the Prisoner" record, he could distinguish the difference in the music. It is truly amazing! With such a rich talent, if he can be trained early, in less than ten years, there will surely be a day when "the whole city will be talking about Little Lanfang."</p>
<p>Madam Fu, Mr. Mei's wife, is very warm, generous, and dignified. After marrying my teacher, she hired a teacher to study, and she can complete the books on Mencius and classical Chinese. The other day, we talked about Zhang Jian of Nantong refusing to open the Zhaoguan Dam (later, the downstream had a good harvest, and Zhang Jian donated rice from the downstream to help the upstream). Madam said: This is what is meant by "If there is famine in Henan, then move its people to Hedong, and move its grain to Henan; if there is famine in Hedong, do the same." The use of allusions is very appropriate. Her speech and manner are indicative. Recently, she has become even better at managing the household. If she can use her spare time to pursue the pleasures of classical books again, it is indeed a way to pass the time. Mr. Mei's mother-in-law also lives in Mr. Mei's house. Besides, there are only two or three maids and four or five male servants! It is not like what outsiders say, that he keeps many bodyguards. Mr. Mei has no conflicts with anyone, and his assets are not even up to par with the average person. Outwardly, it is like a bucket of Gallic cigarettes, but inside it contains Front Gate brand cigarettes, which can be described as "sheep in tiger's skin." Among the wealthy in Shanghai, he is really not even a grain of rice in Taicang. So, in fact, there is no need to take precautions. However, because he often travels for performances, he needs someone to take care of him on the way, so the few people used in the house are mostly heroes from Yan and Zhao. Each one is strong and powerful, and good at shooting. However, after entering the Mei family, they are heroes with no place to use their talents.</p>

<p>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</p>
<h3>Yuanwai, Beile, Candidate Official</h3>
<p>In the old days, people who often traveled around were even more attentive to their nicknames. For example, when the old hero Chu Biao of the "Wax Temple" registered after disguising himself, he deliberately raised his voice to emphasize the seven words "Known in the Jianghu as Iron-Armed Biao," forcefully reading them out. It can be seen that the old hero Chu was very proud of receiving the nicknames "Iron-Armed Biao" and "Iron-Headed Tai Sui." At the same time, any young hero who had not earned a nickname always felt that his qualifications were shallow and his reputation was small.</p>
<p>The nicknames given to people in the pear garden are based on their personality, appearance, etc., such as Yu Mao Bao and Wang Datou. Some are named after people's attire, dress, actions, style, etc. There are three people who belong to the latter category, namely Li Yuanwai Lianzhong, Tan Beile Xinpei, and Sun Candidate Official Juxian.</p>
<p>Li Lianzhong is the teacher of the current internal court senior retainer Rui Debao, and was one of the best martial arts performers in the old days. His movements were skilled and his dialogue was crisp. Whenever Tan performed "Battle of Changsha," he would always have Li play the role of Wei Yan, which was known as the three perfects at the time. Even Xiaolou's complete "Stealing the Imperial Horse" could not achieve the effect of complementing each other without Li playing Dou Erdun. However, the old gentleman originally came from a Bangzi troupe and was used to being frugal, so he never wore silk in his life. In winter, he would wear a blue cloth robe over a cloth belt, with blue cloth shoes, a felt hat, and a long-stemmed early smoking pipe in his hand; his tobacco pouch was filled with old Guandong (tobacco leaves. Extremely pungent). People would suspect that he was a country bumpkin when they saw his attire. (121)</p>
