<p>社評</p>
<h3>論蘇匈絕交</h3>
<p>二月二日，蘇聯突然宣布跟匈牙利斷絕正常外交關係，封閉駐匈使館，並希望匈牙利也同樣封閉駐蘇使館；以後蘇聯跟匈牙利有什麼交涉，可通過兩國駐第三國國都的外交代表來臨時辦理。這一舉動不但發揮了蘇聯辯證式外交的精神，開了世界外交史上的一個新紀元；而且目前正當美總統羅斯福闡明外交政策，宣佈積極援助民治國家的時候，蘇聯這一舉動，好像洛鐘西應，對於那趾高氣揚的侵略國家，不啻又是一個嚴重的打擊，無怪要震動世界的視聽，値得大書特書的了。</p>
<p>考蘇聯宣布對匈絕交的原因，並非是一種宣戰的序慕，不過爲了匈牙利目前在形式上雖然還是一個國家，實際已是德義軸心的附庸，喪失了獨立的資格，所以不必和她發生那互駐使節的外交關係。蘇聯所持的理由就是：一，自從慕尼黑協定成立以後，匈牙利政府已失去了獨立性，受某某等國的支配；二，匈牙利政府加入了反共國際公的，而該國利益與該公的參加者，尤其是日本的侵略目的並不相符，顯然不過受了其他國家的敎嗾，事實上已失去了國家的自由意志，所以不能算是一個獨立的國家。然而我們要知道，中歐三國家中問，自從奧地利被併吞，捷克斯拉夫被宰割以後，事實上匈牙利早已做了侵略陣綫的附庸，不必等到蘇聯揭發她，才使世界上都知道她是一個名存實亡的國家。而且匈牙利目前不過是一個蕞爾小邦，領土不過九萬二千餘方公里，人口不過八百多萬，雖然她擁有多腦河中流的農業盆地區域，可是在國際地位上顯然不關重要，蘇聯又何必對她這樣重視，在她身上開這麼一個外交的先例呢？這就可見蘇聯此舉，不單是對匈牙利一國而發，弦外之音，分明別有重大的意義。</p>
<p>第一點：自從捷克事件發生以後，民治陣綫顯然着着退讓；等到西班牙琶塞隆納城陷落的時候，侵略國家更是氣燄萬丈，睥睨一切。當張伯倫以捷克爲魚肉的時候，蘇聯方面力持緘默，世界各國很有一種錯覺，以爲蘇聯並不是民治國家的眞正友人，縱容着張伯倫輩作那退讓的舉動。到了最近，西班牙戰局急轉直下，歐西大勢岌岌可危，德國爲避免多方樹敵起見，忽表示有與蘇聯修好之意，蘇聯也似乎沒有堅决拒絕的表示，使各民治國家都懷抱着憂懼。然而恰好在這樣的時機，蘇聯突然宣布對匈絕交，表示着一種鮮明的立塲，把世界上一部分的陰霾一掃而空，這當然要使倫敦方面表示欣慰，德國外交部通商司東歐科長施努勒立即停止莫斯科的行程了</p>
<p>第二點：世界上斷不容許存在着許多模稜兩可的中間物。自從捷克事件發生以後，歐洲各小國態度就不很明朗。論理，小國的地位誠然最不易處，事晋事楚，左右爲難；可是到底環境總會逼得陣營非淸楚不可的。而且在現狀下面，陣營越早分得淸楚，世界戰禍反越容易避免。試看美國英國積極援助了中國，日本的侵略氣燄就相當的低落下去；羅斯福談話一經發表，德義對法的態度就緩和下來，這都是很好的例證。蘇聯對匈絕交，就是對東歐其他國家下一警告，敎她們趕快决定自己的態度；而且暗示她們，爲發揚正義起見，就應該放棄對侵略國的接近，來共同維持世界的和平。因此蘇聯對匈絕交消息露布以後，法國德國輿論就都有上述的推測；羅馬尼亞允因切身的關係，立即表示羅蘇兩國應該愈臻密切，這就是蘇聯又一方面的收穫。</p>
<p>此外我們應注意，侵略國雖然能夠控制幾個其他的國家，可是只限於那些國家的政府，絕不能控制她們的民衆。據巴黎方面的蘇聯人士觀察，認爲匈牙利人民向富民族心，此决或能因蘇聯的警告，促使其政府改變對侵略國親善的態度。果爾，則世界上的公道到底還在大衆的心中，侵略國的黷武者也應該有所警覺了吧！</p>

<h3>英外相發表演說　力為張伯倫政策辯護　努力綏靖歐局武力恃為後盾　全國人民團結為國家圖生存</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相哈立法克斯勳爵昨在赫爾地方演說、切實聲明英國重整軍備之成績、略謂因已往兩三年中從事廣大之運動、英國於海陸空三方面已有長足之進步、而漸恢復其古代之實力、如事變降臨、任何方面試思英國將不能善自發揚、則作此思者必鑄大錯、現代戰爭爲慘烈之事、吾人當然須受損害、第吾人有權盡力之所能以避免之、英國人民所欲爲之最後一事、固爲消弭爭端、惟如有人强以爭端加諸英人、則余於彼等之回報、及此舉之最後實效、毫無疑慮、蓋英人天性不屈於威力也、今國家與個人間關係之固定於自由及尊重人格基礎者、巳到處代以與英人所視爲根本要則相反之哲學、此種哲學之衝突、與夫大戰後所遺留之擾攘情緒、實造成今日之空氣、在此空氣中不容忍常爲人視爲强徵、容忍則常爲人視爲弱微、英國朝野今即在此空氣中被召試建眞正之和平、余知引誘常足陷於自認失敗之地位、余擬放棄似無結果之努力、首相張伯倫中止試圖恢復歐洲之信任、殊屬易易、在他人必早已中止矣、首相因堅忍不撓、大受抨擊、但余知受誘蓄存虛偽之幻想者、莫首相若、首相與政府中任何人員無一似稍輕視目前國際大局之困難與危險、首相不因本國之抨擊放棄其經營眞正和平之努力、而在國外則抨擊甚鮮、縱一切努力歸於失敗、英國不得不應付戰事、吾人仍有百分之百分之權力、使吾人所嘗作與現正從事之努力、以一種更精良之方法昭示歐洲、此實爲余所無疑者、如果發生此種情事、英國全部不分黨派及其他一切、將團結而爲一人、而表示其對和平之眞誠志願、超越懷疑之任何可能性、彼等將對正誼抱無匹之精神上的信心、其效果必將不可估量也、哈氏繼謂渠非視戰爭爲不可免者之一、並引述我國關於維持地中海現局、及西班牙戰事結束後義國將不向西班牙作土地上之要求一事所作之保作、於是續言曰、西班牙之爲歐洲政治中擾亂困紫、已兩年餘矣、英法皆以其足以危害兩國重要利益爲憂、職是之故、吾人對墨索里尼所作之保證、極爲重視、</p>
<p>哈氏繼乃爲英國主張不干涉西戰政策辯護、接曰、吾人處尋常國際接觸機關頗失靈活之今日、往往空氣濃厚、謠言密播、幾若定有一總製造廠加工製造而救發之、惟因此而起非必要之恐慌、殊足令人扼腕、而余所察覺之惟一應響、厥爲全國更見團結、吾民更具鎭靜之决心、關於輔助後備軍役、現自願應募投効者巳逾一百萬人、自由公民如是踴躍志願投效、爲國盡役、此在增固和平中之力量、無更强於此者、總之、吾英一切人民皆團結以衛護英國、而準備盡其所當爲、以求保全彼等所認爲國家生存所必耍者、英國人民固多需要和平、但其犬性知其生活中有許多事、缺之即將不値生活、惟和平亦爲其所負之責任、日者希特勒曾宣布德國必需輸出其物品、吾則人於死途、此確爲德國之眞相、然英國亦固如是也、惟希氏所稱大戰之作、乃圖驅德國於世界貿易市傷之外一言、甚不得其眞、耍知德國在大戰之前、爲英國最佳之主顧、兩國之以商業與金融相密切結合者、莫英德若、吾人曷爲於當時或現在欲擯絕德國於世界貿易市塲之外乎、吾人之在英、從不相信競爭即爲獨佔、吾人相信在繁榮與和平時代中競爭、足以增進各方面之貿易者也、</p>
<p>哈氏决涉及希特勒所發今後將有長時期的和平之預言、謂余之切望此言之實踐也、非他人所能及、此將予世界以和平之眞正保證、商業可以復興、經濟得能發展、而使衆庶因以咸受其福於是前世紀之一切成續、將膛若乎後矣、世界長此爲一武裝營壘、則目前之種種困難、總將爲累、第其程度之大小、未可知耳、苟非各國協力同心、以求共同之福利、則基本的經濟標準决不能有所改善、吾人朝夕　勉以求者、即他國與吾人接手以肫摯之决心博取此種進步也、</p>
<p>最後一事爲吾人所願有者、厥爲貿易之天然發展、而使他人咸獲裨益、蓋吾人稔知此種貿易之發展、實與人人有利也、哈氏歡迎英德所訂之煤業協定、視爲對兩國合作之實際的貢獻、且爲前途有望之佳徵哈氏續稱、浪費資金人工於不生利事項如軍器之類與夫缺乏信任、畏懼戰爭、皆足摧毀貿易、渠不欲討論德國或他國之困難、可以一個國家權力、範圍內之行動予以减輕之程度、惟渠知世界長此爲一武裝營壘、則目前種種之困難總將爲累耳、</p>
<p>哈氏决乃批評羅斯福總統數週前所發之議淪以明白表示其主義者、謂中多與英國人民之懷抱相脗合、英美人民在此革命時代、當知必以抵抗破壞和平的武力爲其一切努力之目的、哈氏演說之一部分、爲分析使現代世界中國際事務益增困難與複雜之各種因紫、其重要者一爲距離之消滅、一爲在深入個人國家生活的根本之許多事上、思想各別、益見尖銳、</p>
<p>哈氏末乃涉及義國、謂英義兩國最近之牴牾、其尖銳在英國對外關係中莫此爲甚、、蓋法西斯洽制與英國之治制完全不同、義國已成羅馬柏林軸心之一部分、此在義國、爲其政策必要之一項、正如英法協的亦爲英國政策必要之一項也、最近首相躬自報聘羅馬、其目的卽在銷釋英義兩國間此項異見云、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）維斯福總統昨日招待各報記者時、曾痛斥各報、謂許多關於美國防務及外交政策之紀載、乃屬完全夢囈、並稱、外傳渠向參院軍事委員會所發談話之消息、爲一種故意的謊語云、有問以一月三十一日與參院軍委會會議時、曾吾發表「美國之邊境在法國或在萊茵」一語者、羅總統答以此種消息、必係傳聞失實、江力言渠不但未作此語、且此亦不符事實、美國之外交政策、已於渠致國會咨文中詳言之、其性質極爲簡單、並無任何新增加者、渠知外間所傳之談話、必受英法之讚揚、而遭德義之抨擊、惟此項讚揚及抨擊、皆係根據於一種誤傳之事實也、</p>
<p>維總統當即發表美國外交政策之要點如下、（一）美國反對錯綜之聯盟、（二）贊同維持各方面之世界貿易、（三）對於裁减或限制軍備之任何努力、均予以完全之同情、（四）就國家立塲言、美國同情於以和平方法、維持世界一切國家政治經濟及社會之獨立、羅氏又稱、渠最近與衆院及參院委員會之會議、所以秘密不宣者、其實並無任何作用、不過因有某項悄報、係由諜報機關得來、如予以發表、則此項消息來源、即將中斷也、羅總統鄭重聲言、美國外交政策現在及將來均無變動、一部份議員及報主人對於此事、實作有意之誤解云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於羅斯福總統外交政策及究竟曾吾向參院軍事委員會發表意見之爭論、現仍未輟、羅總統雖作吾認、但據紐的通報載稱、參議員兩人昨曾非公開告人、白宮開會討論時、羅總統羅曾提及「邊界」、且曾提及「第一道防錢」、羅總統謂如果開戰、此二者將在法國云、羅總統今責參議員數人說謊造謠、參議員不特因此表示驚訝、且爲憤懣不置、但吾認羅總統昨日對外交政策所發之言論與前秘密語彼等者相同、某參議員曰、今日余所讀關於外交政策之言、確與日前告委員會者大不相同云、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>湘西旅行記</h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>水陸交通已較便捷　苗民愛國情緒熱烈</p>
<p>乾城通訊，「桃花源外泛輕舟，賸水殘山汗漫遊，夾岸峯嵐秦洞寫，滿江風月楚天秋。飄零故國身千里，潦倒新亭酒一甌，醉後不嫌在似昔，高吟幾度看吳鈞。」此記者桃源秋夜泛舟作也。記者自客歲離徐，飄零湘西，旣感國破家亡，且受某方通緝，田廬已鵲巢鳩佔，骨肉則散處天涯，落拓風塵，慨然投筆，喜聞本報復刊，爰就征鞭所及，擷誌湘西鴻爪，或亦關心西南者之所樂覩歟。</p>
<p>湘西交通山水險阻　湘西羣山綿亘，崗嶺起伏，沅水迢迢，迂流其間；湘西交通，恃此一綫，近年所闢之湘西公路，亦沿沅水作平行錢，中間距離，最遠者不及百里，且多劈山爲道，盤旋迂曲，事行殊險，是以物產轉輸，仍惟沅水舟楫是賴。記者此决長征，即以常德爲起點，沿沅水而上，凡四十日而達瀘溪，計過大灘五，小灘十餘，而紀程則尚不足五百華里，可謂極交通之難。由瀘溪而上，水道則沿沅水入貴，公路則在三角坪分支，湘西公路由此沿沅水經辰谿·芷江·晃縣·以達黔省之鎭遠，川湘公路由此沿瀘溪經乾城永綏以達川省之秀山，蓋湘西公路西南行，而川湘公路則西北行，此湘西交通之大略也。</p>
<p>昔日桃源　今賦同仇　當由常德起椗時，已屆晚秋，江平水穩，大小帆船，航行利便，惟汽輪則只能駛行至桃源以下，即須擱淺。緣沅水只常德桃源一段，四時可通汽輪，桃源以上，春夏兩季，航行無阻，秋冬則水淺灘出，帆船亦非加縴不能通過，而當夏季水發之際，則只有汽輪行駛，帆船又告絕跡矣。夏水以舊曆五月爲最甚，土人硯水之法，視本歲之有無春雪，春雪後百日而水發，設本議無春雪，則終歲水穩。識者推厥原因，謂春雪易融，斷難久積，上游崇山峻嶺，雪解水流，羣川競睢，爲勢甚猛，須百日而達，歷試不爽；至冬雪則無此測騐。記者舟過桃源時，適値警報，雖一度舍舟登陸，巡視縣城，而商肆大多閉戶，街道窄狹，惟尚整潔，我某部駐此，設防甚周，社敎團亦正在調整民間工作。據施敎隊劉君云：桃源雖古稱幽僻，但以接近常德，交通便利，逈非上游各地可比，民氣甚爲發皇，縣城在沅水北岸，湘西公路則沿南岸西行，而向來稱道之秦人古洞，亦在南岸羣山中，距城可三十華里，惜乎舟行窩遠，未能一往遊也。惟古稱避世之地，而今則敵愾同仇，亦殊足令人色喜，秦不足避，誓將偕亡矣。</p>
<p>沅江多灘　兩岸削壁　舟過桃源，漸决入灘，沅水上游，以沅陵至桃源，三百華里之間，最爲多灘之段，大灘均在沅陵境內，沿江上溯，初爲甕子洞，决淸浪灘，决駡娘灘，决橫石灘，决九溪灘，五大灘中，淸浪最險，灘長五里，岸側有新息侯祠，一稱伏波宮，祀漢伏波將軍馬援像，香火極盛。商船往來，於此下椗，必一禱祀，土人享祭允虔，俗稱王爺廟，蓋沅水上游，爲古五溪蠻地，伏波平蠻，即沿江上溯，淸浪灘則其駐軍處也。灘多砥石，水爲石束，道窄而流急，舟行經此，必臨時加增縴失，背纜在岸，伏地拖舟而行，水窄處僅容一舟，當記者到此時，由灘口下至於洞庭溪五里之間，帆檣如織，皆候序過灘者，獨我舟以輕小便利，從容獲過，未致躭延。聞有候牛月之久，尚未起椗者，灘流之浚治，父烏可緩耶。下游甕子洞水道亦狹，惟灘短尚易通過，上游駡娘。橫石。九溪諸灘，水急而道寬，亦無停舟，惟各灘均兩岸削壁，　路窄峻，甕子洞之岸道允陡，鑿石繫鐵練以供攀援，淸康熙時辰州知府興修，舊有三百餘丈，近亦殘缺不完。　夫背纜登岸，握練以防傾側，蛇行匍匐而前，土人以此爲業，一縴之加，獲値三數角，持舵者倍之，小灘舊例一縴付米一碗，橫石灘水道寬闊，須放水縴，縴夫背纜涉水以行，深及股際，冬季嚴寒，亦常如此，眞習焉安之者。</p>
<p>沅陵一帶　人烟稠密　沅陵為清辰州府治，城在北岸，倚山建築，形勢雄峻，今湘省府遝此，南岸爲汽車站，人烟密集，湘西第一重鎭也。社會文化，極臻發達，舊有沅濤。辰鐘兩報，近又新增中報，及由長沙移來之國民日報，銷數均廣。湘西消息，胥以此爲樞紐，據社敎團蔡君云：當地民智大開，施敎極爲順利，民族思想甚豐，歷决捐募，均能踴躍輸將，以紓國難。過此而上，至瀘溪境，即有苗民雜處，習性强悍，號稱難治。顧富於傳統思想，湘行署主任陳渠珍氏，極爲苗民所信仰，現陳改設湘西綏署於乾城，治苗尤爲利便，往昔國人所視爲神秘之區，將於此澈底開發。至水道則過沅陵而上又趨平穩，舟行一日抵瀘，瀘溪爲沅水支流，縣治殷實，上游來舟，胥於此寄椗，記者以任務關係，由此改乘汽車以赴乾城，凡三小時而達，車行均在山坡，下臨溪水，蓋即川湘公路也。校之三角坪以上之湘西公路，猶屬平坦，水道則只能划行小船，川湘交通，惟此公路是賴。</p>
<p>湘西苗民生活情狀　乾城爲遜淸乾四面環山，築石爲城，褊小而堅固，公路在城東十五里，而以支道通縣城，叫鄉苗民麕集雜處，十里左右，全係熟苗，三十里外，即見生苗，熟苗服裝，男女皆以靑布纏頭，赤足草履，男子衣着，尚與漢人無別，女子則仍淸季服式，允喜佩銀飾，項圈練鎖，垂滿胸前，入市買賣，亦能漢語，生苗則聚處山中，殊鮮入市，生熟苗皆喜飲鴨血，肆中列碗盛血，苗民輒就而暢飲，男女均健步，登山如飛，通行川省銅兀，近經綏署佈者，一律行使法幣，地方各界，完全擁護法幣政策，信用昭著，近且通行於苗民，苗民抗戰情緒亦極高，陳氏一令之力也。中小敎師服務團在乾社社敎工作，頗獲成効，今歲元旦，張治中氏巡視湘西，在乾備受各界之歡迎，晚間地方民衆，復舉行火炬遊行，充分表現民族精神之高潮，此眞堪告慰國人者也。此後深入苗疆，更有佳音，當續誌以告閱者。</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>金融津帮出籠　現金突然轉挫　重進五十元關</h3>
<p>昨日現金給赤暗盤市况，驟然轉疲、蓋至天津帮忽聞該地金價已回降至二千零五十元光景、因之難獲重利、故上兩日託證券帮所進之多頭、均來脫售、加以某金號亦來拋塞、雖其時某錢兌業代本市殷富吸購尚力、然仍感供過於求、致價遂不支下降、唯中途曾因港帮忽託某銀樓曁某錢兌業代爲搜購、故市價一度稍向上升、卒以求不敵供、終難久持、故結果回跌九元、各方人心略疲、交易平平、祗六百兩、銀樓飾金亦回小一元、海關金曁中英純金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤回跌九元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開雖聞外滙緊勢頗銳、惟因證券帮售意濃厚、故晨開反見疲軟、首由某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、二千零五十一元爲開盤價、比上日做低五元、繼之又進證券帮五十兩、價五十元、此後因證券帮代天津帮賣意甚濃、且某錢兌業扳價吸購、以致下挫、證券帮售予銀樓帮五十兩、價四十六元、父售予某錢兌業五十兩、價四十四元、再售予銀樓帮五十兩、價四十三元、（聞某錢兌業所進、大致均代本市殷富吸購）、其間另一錢兌業忽代港帮猛進、且證券帮已止售旁觀、故價遂一躍而上、進銀樓帮五十兩、價四十七元、及現金號五十兩、價四十九元、某銀樓亦代港帮購買百兩、價則相同、均由某金號供給、又進現金號五十兩、價四十八元、其時某錢兌業又代本市殷富搜購、進金號三十兩、價五十元、又進金號五十兩、價四十九元爲午收價、午後因外匯無市、故交易轉寂、唯價因證券帮代天津帮售意復萌、且進者均無納胃、致乃重復趨疲、僅在二時半許、且錢兌業售予金號二十兩、價四十五元、此後證券帮代天津帮仍想晚售、因進者更稀、故賣價雖喊低至四十二元、然仍靴獲對手、致未做開、（聞某錢兌業門市最低做過四十元）、故晚收價仍爲二千零四十五元、較上日軋跌九元、全天八元差度、現金號之本脾金售出價二千零五十五元、收進二千零四十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金改小一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至午後三時一刻、因鑒烚赤破入五十元關內、且爲狀略疲、故而均掛小一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百零七元、新同行亦改懸二百零五元、收進一百九十九元、</p>
<p>純金呆定不動</p>
<p>三日倫敦電、英純金每盎司依然呆定於七鎊八先令七辦士半、中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦仍屬一千二百十三元三角、掛牌海關金亦未動、仍計二元三角八分七釐、上海標準標金價隨之未更、仍爲一千二百零八元六角、</p>
<h3>外幣出籠</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美匯兌升一二五、外匯洋行結款稍稀、天津外銀行需要亦减、港電售出尚盛、是以供求尚平、趨勢穩定、烚赤開盤尚堅、嗣市價已高、收藏者獲利甚厚、漸起出籠、市價盤旋下瀉、交易甚旺、下午交易稀少、趨勢軟弱、外幣因烚赤軟弱、收藏者紛起出籠、惟外滙穩定、故下降甚微、門市交易旺盛、公會交易求盛、復盛出鴻昌進英金鎊二十個、鎭興出同豐進美金旅行票五百元、父出長泰進法郞票二千五百個、鎰康出鴻昌進英金磅十個、昨日市價、英金鎊降一角、英金票降七分、美金鎊降一角、香港票降三厘、法郞票降半厘、新加坡票斐律濱票各降一分、其他各幣、俱無更動、</p>
<h3>貼現軋小半元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率。續見低落、每千元大勢盤於三十六元內外、上午曾高至三十六元七角半、後即步退至午刻爲三十六元二角半、下午一度退至三十六元內、終爲三十六元、比上日跌落半元云、</p>
<h3>平津外銀行　在滬續買外滙　委託有利猛收以抵法幣頭寸匯價一度劇緊港電力塞稍回</h3>
<p>滙市昨以有利銀行代平津外商銀行界力吸不已、兼沙遜亦追隨扒結、故雖當時港電供塞、但以頭寸終屬求過於供、致潛勢一度劇緊、先令僅結八辦士二〇三一二五、美金軟至十六元關口、幾乎破入、終則英金回平、美滙稍緊、港匯亦因銀行界買興蓬勃、狀况亦見續緊、蓋自上月下旬傳、華北平津一帶、將於三月九日起、退止法幣流通、致在平津之外商各行擁有大最法幣者、莫不電滬購結外滙、以抵法幣頭寸云、</p>

<h3>工商談助「聯銀」不絕吸收外匯　應採之對策如何</h3>
<p>— 王烈望</p>
<p>日來報載「僞聯銀」大量吸收外滙，致上海外匯黑市時告猛緊，乃港電及華銀行競相湧塞，漲勢爲之稍殺，此事關係非輕，財政當局亟應改變政策，抵禦敵方陰謀。</p>
<p>自去年中央實施外滙統制以後，黑市滙價，一瀉千里，旋穩定於英滙八辦士以上美匯十五元至十六元之間，然法幣之流入於敵人後方者，既不能完全杜絕，資金逃避者，仍有加無已，敵方蓄意破壞法幣基礎謀之愈急，「僞聯銀」猛吸外滙，即爲敵方正面進攻之一種。我方旣不能予以還擊，又不能深溝高壘，而反不惜犧牲，維持黑市，用心不可謂不苦。默揣當局之意，上海黑市，仍爲國際金融之聯繫點，若不予維持，則不但有碍友邦之商業利益，即法幣之對外信用，亦將掃地無餘，故不用正面防禦手段，而專從限制法幣流入敵手設法。然而現在法幣之流入敵手，不能完全杜絕，則爲有目共覩之事，遂致外滙黑市，竟有敵扒我塞之痛心現象，我賣敵買，其結果即爲取我之國外資源以濟敵，事之痛心，莫過於此！</p>
<p>對外貿易改為國營；</p>
<p>放棄維持外匯黑市政策；</p>
<p>茲就鄙見所及建議下列二大方案以資抵禦：</p>
<p>此二種方案，如何施行，有何困難？其結果如何？請逐一論之。</p>
<p>對外貿易改爲國營此案目的，即在集中出口外滙，增加國外資源，並防止出口外滙爲敵所得，或被奸商收買用於不需要之進口。去年財政部雖已施行出口外滙之統制，規定二十餘種之重要出口貨，須向國家銀行結售外滙，後父减爲十餘種，用以獎勵出口貨之增加，此在當局，自有其不得已之苦衷，然其無濟大局，灼然可見。貿易國營，實爲抗戰期內必須採取之政策，此策較之於統制出口外滙，效果旣大，困難亦不致更多。實施步驟，祇須將現有之貿易調整委員會改組爲國外貿易局，在各地設立分局，分局之下，冉可分設支局及辦事處，直接收買出口貨品而予以較優之價。其資本可請各銀行加入。此不但可以達到上述之目的，抑目可以减除中間人之剝削，有利於農民之收入。惟經濟行政，最易發生貪汚情事，以致失信於民衆，有關將來之成敗，故稽查糾察，必須格外嚴厲，犯者不論數目大小，一律處以極刑，或謂我國出口營業，多爲友邦洋行所專利，此策未免與彼有所衝突，爲爭取國際援助，實應避免，此固不無所見。但實際上友邦出口商行之在內地者，實已不能有所作爲，長江旣未開放，戰區鐵道則根本無商運之可能，故目前之出口洋行已非戰前可比，其利益早已爲敵所破壞侵奪。是我之國營，並非從出口洋行手上奪回利權，乃出口洋行所不能或不願辦者，我自辦之，不但與彼毫無衝突，抑且有利於外國之進口商，以其仍可獲得我國之供給也。</p>
<p>放棄維持外滙黑市政策我國之維持黑市，其用意誠有如上所述，然而爲長期抗戰計，國外資源，不能再用於維持黑市中之外滙，蓋敵方之吸收外滙已非限制法幣之流入淪陷區域或代以滙劃支付所能制止。法幣之在敵人後方者，爲數旣鉅，抑且有增無减。貨幣非貨物可比，乃永久在流通過程之中，敵人以法幣售與匯市，取得外滙，而滙市中收進法幣者，仍收吐出，以仇貨之充斥於市，法幣又不難轉輾而人於敵人之手，敵又以之在黑市調換外滙，不惜高價以求之，如此轉輾調換，黑市豈能長此維持乎，估計淪陷區之對外收支，以上海天津入超之鉅，迄去年年底，仍爲全國各埠之冠，短期資金，在此種動亂局面之下，自屬出多於進，黑市外滙需供之不能相抵，當可想見。而此差額在敵人陰謀之下，恐永難彌補。爲今之計，當局亦宜仿照拒絕墊付關稅抵押之外債本息辦法，對友邦各銀行提出公告：「中央銀行不冉供給外滙，以免被敵吸收。」此舉對於上海外滙黑市，自屬致命之打擊，有使黑市滙價，起劇烈變動之可能，然其影響所及，當不至如設想中之嚴重。第一，在此存亡絕續之秋，凡屬合理之自衛政策，友邦必能予以諒解，第二，祗須制止通貨之惡性膨脹，照常維持法幣之對外信用，則法幣之對外匯價，亦可因購買力平價之作用而不致於劇跌，第三，政府向外國購買軍需，並不受黑市匯價之影響，以共對外支付直接從中央銀行外滙帳上滙劃，不必向黑市購買外滙也。但中央國外存解（Foreign　balance），必須有不絕之補充，對外貿易之所以必須國營，即係爲此。第四，黑市匯價之變動，亦不致於阻碍友邦之貸款，因我向外借款，均以外幣計算，債權人絕不因滙市之變動而受損失也。</p>
<p>最後應嚴明者，中央是吾在維持外滙黑市，固非局外人所敢斷言，惟從上海黑市之悄况推度，供方之有人維持，實無疑義，如其維持者非爲中央，可不必論，如其吾也，則目前應吾冉繼續予以維持，殊有考慮之必要，以近年來財政常局計慮之週密，施政之穩健，想早在　籌之中。意者英美借款，亦有維持黑市滙價之條件乎？果爾，爲英美計，亦非得策，蓋黑市雖可暫時維持，而借款則爲數有限，桔果借款之利益，轉輾而入於敵手，想友邦亦决不願有此結果也。</p>

<p>證券暗盤，經過三日之高翔、趨勢已見無力、三日上漲之數、少者三元、多者三元數角、做多者冐量似已有飽滿之象、環境上無甚變化、惟國際情勢、漸見露骨、香港之備戰、德義之談話、均有引起破裂之危險性、外匯日見緊硬、與公債方面　覺不利、故一般人咸未抱樂觀、致午後情形根脚較鬆、前途稍稍回鬆後、或將趨於盤旋、</p>
<p>昨日經過、上午開盤、仍在買氣濃厚籠罩中、冉冉再見趨高、十一號天生及大豐號均有相當買進、中途經德孚號以北帮散戶等多方出籠、稍見疲軟、終以同康及潤利以及六十四號等進胃父健、再見上翔、故午前終續漲四角至七角半、午後形勢頓改、賣方驟漲優勢、可見逢賣出者大有人在、十號竟續有脫手、五號及散戶亦均係賣出、上午買進之大豐號、竟又轉賣、市氣受此打擊、乃轉下游、買戶如同康潤利及天生號雖仍有進胃、終以供過於求、而不能振作、惟全日以漲多跌少、結果尚續漲一角半至五角不等、成交總數約計六七萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>我們應該怎樣閱讀</h3>
<p>— 惠人</p>
<p>小朋友，今天我們來談談怎樣閱讀，想來你一定願意知道吧！</p>
<p>什麼呌閱續？簡單的說：就是只用眼睛來看，不用嘴巴來唱。從前的人，讀起書來，總是高聲朗誦。等他讀舉後，問問他書裏的內容，他却會紅着臉搖頭，不能說出來。因爲這樣讀，只是口裹唱，不能注意到意義了。不信的話，你可與私塾裹的小朋友試試看。這樣讀，讀的書又不能多，因爲口唱讀不快；所以讀書的本領也不會好起來。一般的文學家，也都說他們是閱讀書本而成功，不是死誦所可成功的。這是什麼道理呢？第一减少了，的動作，只用眼睛看，當然會看得快。第二，免去口的朗讀，眼睛一停息間所能看到字的個數會多起來。第三，只用眼睛看，容易明瞭書裹的意義，所以現在大家都改用閱讀，除非詩歌等文章，都廢棄朗讀了。</p>
<p>閱讀又分精讀和略讀二種。較短而內容較好較難的文章，要精讀；反之，便可略讀。精讀就是把文章裹的意義要理解明白，好的句子要背得出，還要研究他的文章作法。略讀便不必明白文章的作法，只須知道他內容的大概就是。</p>
<p>我們再談讀書的順序；你讀書要有計劃。今天讀什麼，明天讀什麼，都該預定好。讀的書要加以選擇，揀你有興味程度適合的書；或是請你的老師代爲選擇一下。拿到了一本書，先略路翻閱一下，知道了那書裹的內容大意，遇到不識不解的文字及內容意義，隨時用鉛筆記在筆記簿上。閱完一段或一篇後，再複閱一决，記取內容大意，考查生字難詞。假使有疑問，去問問同學或老師。都明白了，記錄這一項的閱書筆記（附後）。書後如有練習題，也把它解答了請老師修正。</p>
<p>這是你應當注意的，我們每讀一本書，沒有完畢，不可換閱其他讀物。要有恒心的去讀，不可逞一時高興，過了相當時期便冷若冰消，沒有與趣去讀他，吾則是不曾有結果的，讀的時候，要對於書裹的文字都完全了解，內容都明白，重要的地方都記得能口述出來，不明白的地方請　同學或老師，不可有不求甚解的態度。</p>
<p>小朋友，趁你記憶力很好的時候，快快照着我的話去多讀幾本書吧！</p>
<h3>跳繩</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>在冷天，跳繩是一種很好的遊戲。可是跳繩不但是遊戲而已，它還是一種很好的健身操。跳繩的時候，運動全身的肌肉，調和全身的血脈。同時還可以使足部肌肉有了彈性；因此，雖然是着名的運動家，有的身邊還帶着繩子，時常練習。爲的使他跑步或跳高時，更能夠起勁些。</p>
<p>經過這一番的介紹，跳繩的價値，似乎抬高了一些，諸位也許從此不大輕視它了，但是，如果你要練習，姿勢不對，反而有害身體。這是要十分注意的。現在便在這方面大略說些。</p>
<p>跳繩時要兩朋的脚尖落地，而且兩脚尖耍併得很緊。足跟落地是有害腦部的。兩隻上臂要擺動。如果把上臂下臂都靠着不動，僅在腕部用力，是不正確的姿勢。胸部要挺出，跳得吃力了，行幾個深呼吸，這是很合衛生的。</p>
<p>跳了許多時候，如果臉色變白，心跳快得厲害，這是體格不好的緣故，或者姿勢不對的緣故，那時候便耍停下來。做幾個深呼吸，休息休息。次數是要逐漸加多的，練習的時間多了，自然會純熟起來，那時候，卽使跳了一二百决，只在額角流下汗來，臉色不再變白了。</p>
<h3>煤氣常識</h3>
<p>— 亦</p>
<p>是冬去了！許多小朋友的家裹，或者已經把火爐裝了起來，全室溫暖得像春天到來一樣！但小朋友你們要注意，冬天裝火爐，一方面是舒適，另一方面却是危險的！小朋友只要注意一下每年冬天報紙上面載着被煤氣毒死的新聞，你們就可知道裝火爐是怎樣危險的一件事！</p>
<p>小朋友家裏裝了火爐，最好用鉛皮做了烟囱把煤氣引到屋外去。不然的話，全室中就充滿着可怕的煤氣，這煤氣就和氧氣化合，變成二氧化炭的氣體。又因爲室中氧氣有限，而人們呼出來的叉是炭氣，所以繼續產生出來的煤氣，便沒有氧氣和它化合，於是全室都變了另一種氣體呌「一氧化炭」；但這種氣體的性質是有毒的，而且有凝固的性質，人們吸進去以後，就混合在人體內的血液中，於是和血中的氣氣完全化合而且凝固了。小朋友！血液是流動的，它失去了特有的活動本能，當然再不能流動了。於是室中的人就不知不覺的失去了知覺，小朋友！這不是險事嗎？</p>
<p>假使不幸發生了中毒的事，那也不能慌亂，只要很鎮靜的很敏捷的，先把窗子打開，讓新鮮空氣很快的流進去，然後把中毒的人拖到空氣流通的地方，就施行人工呼吸法，這方法在有經騐的人施行以後，是很有把握的，但是切記要有忍耐心，因爲施行四五個小時，是沒有什麼稀奇的。</p>
<p>至於預防的方面，上面巳經說過最好裝烟囱。假使嫌室內空氣太乾燥的話，就可在火爐上加一隻水鍋或銅吊，這樣，室內的空氣就能濕潤，而煮沸的開水，父可隨時應用了。</p>
<h3>冬天的衛生</h3>
<p>— 次愷作</p>
<p>開開窗，換換氣，煂天雖然冷，窗子不要緊緊閉。頭部露出在外面。不要鑽在被窩裏。</p>
<p>牆脚下，晒太陽。弟弟拿着新書看。姐姐穿針做衣裳。爸爸説，「這裏看書光太强，好好目力受損傷。」</p>
<h3>做一個小無綫電家（二）</h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>一　王民和他的堂哥</p>
<p>他的堂哥向他瞟了一眼，就說道，「這呌做儲電器，在無綫機中是用來換人家的。喏，裝在無綫電上，只要用手在這個柄上一旋，收音的電台就換了另外一家了」。他的堂哥一邊說，一邊就做手勢給王民看。</p>
<p>這時，王民聽得起勁極了，張開了口，眼睛動也不動的望着他堂哥，問着說，「那麼怎樣裝在無續電裏去呢」？</p>
<p>「唔」。他堂哥的鼻子裏只唔了一聲，表示很爲難的樣子說，「這……這可一時說不完，但是倘使你歡喜的話，我可以來敎你」。</p>
<p>「那麼做無綫電難不難呢」？王民還是有些不大相信無綫電就可以這麼做得起來的。</p>
<p>「便當，便當，那是便常得很，好吧，就讓我來開始敎你吧」！王民的堂哥很肯定地說。</p>
<p>「好呀！好呀！」王民聽得他的堂哥具敎他做無綫電，就快樂得呌起來。</p>
<p>這天，黃昏的時候，王民的媽從親戚家裏回來，他就搶着說，「媽，哥哥肯敎我做無綫電，慢慢的我做會了，就替你做一隻小的，可以放在身邊，就是走在路上也可以聽，不是很好嗎」？王民講得眉飛色舞，很起勁的樣子。</p>
<p>「噢噢，你做了出來再講吧」。王民媽也有些不大相信的樣子，很不耐煩的跑去燒晚飯了。</p>
<p>天漸漸的黑下來，書房朋裹黑漆殷一團，但弟兄兩人還坐.在裹面談天。這晚王民很高興，飯也來不及吃好，就拖着堂兄去講話。講得得很夜深的時候，還想不着睡，還是他的母親提醒了他纔惴怏的上床。</p>
<p>二　認識零件</p>
<p>第二天的一早，弟兄二人很早的就起身。剛揩過血，王民就問他的堂哥說，「哥哥，做無綫電第一要學些什麼呢」？</p>
<p>「哦是的，你不是對於無錢電中用的零件都還沒有認識嗎？讓我先把各種零件同你介紹一下吧」！他的堂哥停了一下叉說，「我們現在第一個要做的是礦石機，那麼我先講礦石機上用的零件」。於是，他拿起一隻一片片的東西說：</p>
<p>這呌做儲電器（見圖一），但有的人也呌它做電容器，其實都是一樣的，就是由外國名字譯的不同的道理」。</p>

<h3>我是個可憐的女孩</h3>
<p>— 啟秀小學五年級生　黃秀娟</p>
<p>我在一歲的時候，就失去了幸福，爲什麼呢？緣在一歲的時候，我就是一個孤女了！那時我父親去世了，全靠我慈愛的母親，把我從一尺多長養到成人，如今十四歲了，才在讀五年級啊！這只好怨自己的命苦。父親死了之後，母親很辛苦的維持着生活「書」當然是不能够早讀了，所以到現在還在五年級。我有時想起了自已，這樣大還在小學，實在有點慚愧，我再也不願生存在世間了。但是回頭一想：我們做人並不是爲着個人，爲的是國家，假使每一個人都這樣想，國家不就富强了嗎？父母養大我們，根本是爲國家，所以我們現在更要用心讀書，將來爲國家服務。</p>
<h3>光陰是寶貴的</h3>
<p>— 文昌小學二年級生　吳鼎坤</p>
<p>有一天，吃過了晚飯，爸爸給我一個謎語猜，他說：「看不見摸不着，不能買，不能借，這是什麼東西」。我說：「看不見的是空氣，摸不着的是電光，不能買的是父母，不能借的是兒女」。爸爸說：「不對，我說的是一樣東西」。我想了好久沒有想出，後來爸爸說：「這就是光陰；因爲它是看不見，模不着，不能買，不能借，所以光陰是寶貴的」。我聽了覺得沒有意思</p>
<p>在牀上，我想了好久，才知道光陰眞是寳貴的：因爲它是只去不回的。我由小漸漸地長大，再也不能回到小的時候。今天是二十八年二月二日，再也沒有第二個二十八年二二日。這就是光陰一去不回的現像。光陰眞是不能買，不能借的東西，它眞寶貴極了。</p>
<p>小朋友，我得到了這個答案後，越想越對。希望各位小朋友，後今天起，要寶貴光陰，要節省光陰。隨時隨地不要放過她，因為光陰是寶貴的。</p>
<h3>雨後</h3>
<p>— 廣肇女小五年級生　厲聲明</p>
<p>暴風呼呼的響着。綫似的細雨正在空中飄蕩。</p>
<p>一會兒，那疏由很緩慢而且很默然的靜止了。</p>
<p>當雨止了之後，我便慢慢。的踱上洋台。台面上雖是洋灰的，但是並不十分的平坦，有好幾個淺窩，積留了一些雨水</p>
<p>一陣陣的、　從地面上捲了起來，于霎時，已吹上洋台來。淺窩中的雨水，亦被它吹得起了波紋。波紋的狀態，是十分輕軟，好像薄紗被風吹着飄動似的。</p>
<p>洋台下面的泥地上，被水圍成了一個個的島嶼，散漫的分開着。</p>
<p>仰頭一看，天上起了無數的鱗雲，都是灰蒼蒼的顏色，好像是很不着急的開遊着。有時它們的孔隙內，還能看到裹面襯着的白雲及最裹面藏着的靑天。這種自然可愛的景像，似乎整個空間的汚垢，在雨後已經洗凈了。</p>
<p>每家的屋頂上的烟囱中，漸漸地放出一絲絲的烟霧，慢慢地被天空吞沒了。</p>
<p>房屋的周圍，便是靑山，都披着一件褐色的斗蓬，顯上蓋了一層薄灰紗的小帽。它們的衣帽上面，是雜亂而稀疏的點綴着綠葉黑枝和被水洒成棕黃色的岩石。餘外的東西已遠隔我了，使我糢糊看不淸，只能看見它們一點無邊沿的影子。</p>
<p>天空是很靜寂的，大地已被黑暗罩了下來，初也從洋台上走了下來，回到室中。</p>
<h3>記夢</h3>
<p>— 民智小學六年級生　徐武丁</p>
<p>晚上已十一點鐘了！我一人正在看書，忽然來了一個素不相識的老人，呌我到野外去欣賞風景！我不知不覺地隨他去了！</p>
<p>過不多時，有一陣陣的香氣，迎面撲來！來原我們已到野外了！野外的風景，眞可愛啊！除了有濃香馥郁的奇花異草外，還有　闊　流，美麗的小鳥，令人見了，如入仙境！我看得出神了，因此呆呆地立着。忽然面前來了一條長的一丈，組的六寸的大蛇！向我開着血盆般的大口，好像要咬我的樣子！我害怕極了！心中一驚，便醒了！睜眼一看，什麼老人啊！奇花異草啊！廣闊河流啊！小鳥大蛇啊！一些也沒有，原來是南柯一夢！</p>

<h3>冬天睡眠應注意的數點</h3>
<p>— 順基</p>
<p>甲，不冒被—冬天睡眠，因天冷的緣故，小朋友們冒被而睡覺的，那是很多，道是很不相宜。因爲冒被睡覺，有下面四個害處：</p>
<p>一，因爲睡眠是全部的休息，使日間操作所積留在筋肉間的疲勞毒素，得乘機而宣泄，恢復體力。倘是蒙被而睡，被中空氣惡濁，血液旣因不能吸得新鮮空氣，而混濁疲勞毒素的發洩，就極困難了。</p>
<p>二，倘若冒被成習，偶一露頭被外，卽覺冷氣由鼻孔直刺腦門，最易傷腦，或致鼻膜炎，流涕不休。</p>
<p>三，而部易起皺　，唇皮口角，發生裂痕。</p>
<p>四，呼吸困難，容易發生夢魔；如外面火災及不幸事件的聲音，也不易聽得，很是危險。</p>
<p>乙，不烘爐—我們睡眠時，往往覺得被褥寒冷，很喜歡烘脚爐，殊不知烘脚爐有下面幾點害處：</p>
<p>一，脚爐放床上，空氣容易混濁，有碍呼吸氣管。</p>
<p>二，偶一不愼，易釀火災。</p>
<p>三，然度過高，容易灼傷皮膚，我們如其覺得脚寒冷，可以在睡前操一二節柔軟操，使全身血流加速，體溫加高。或以溫水洗足，萬不可養成被內烘脚爐的習慣。</p>
<p>丙，不貪睡—塞天貪睡晏起，差不多是一般小朋友們的通病。要知遲睡固是傷身，晏起亦是有害。若怕氣候嚴寒，那遲早終須起身，又何必遷延呢？况且早起祇要養成習慣，就在寒冬，也不成問題。早起以後，一方面可以多吸新鮮空氣，强健身體；另一方面可以增加許多時間，留爲習字讀書之用，實在是一舉兩得哩。</p>
<h3>蒞杭</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之十二—</p>
<p>這是一個秋高氣爽的日子，是明兄離別了第二個家的第三天了，也就是他破題兒第一遭到杭州的一天。杭州，他已渴望了好久了，因爲他時常聽得人們說：「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」。到底杭州有甚麼好？値得稱爲人間的天堂呢？他今天可以到杭州了心中暗暗的歡喜，却不敢說出來。</p>
<p>那三艘小船在水光接天的小河中前進着，船夫們也爭先恐後的競爭着，可是明兒的那隻船總是領頭，明兒的心中很是感激那船夫。他恨不得即刻到杭州，愈是心急，不知怎的反覺那小船行駛得比以前慢了。搖！搖　已是午刻，太陽漸漸向西移了，可是船離開杭州在明兒的眼中還不見什麼。</p>
<p>那船夫突指着那東南的一座大橋，便開口道：「那邊便是杭州了」。明兄即忙隨着那　夫所指着的望去，只見一些糢糊的黑影橫在河面上。</p>
<p>一輪紅紅的太陽，在那　遠的河邊，漸漸地被那河水吞沒了。叫周的黑幕也隨着慢慢的籠罩下來，一陣陣一隊隊的歸鴉哇哇地呌着，這時明兒的心頭差不多要冒出火星來，因爲他已伸長了頭頸，眼巴巴望了整整的一天了。</p>
<p>那糢糊的黑影有些淸晰了，三個大大的橋洞，明兒更看見在岸上的行人不斷的往來着，更能望見點點的燈光和聽到一陣嘈雜的聲音了。</p>
<p>在下午七時左右，他們才到了這第二决逃難的第一個階段——杭州了，明兒早已在船頭上，預備一傍了岸，立即跳上岸去玩個暢快。那知明兒的父親呌他們在船上等着，於是他和張李兩先生到岸上去接洽了。</p>
<p>明兒厭惡那小船是到了極點了，又小又髒，害得他屈了三天的脚，一時都站不起來，今天有了這大好的機會，而又被父親阻止着，那時明兒心中又氣又恨，却不敢反抗父親的命令，袛硬着頭皮忍耐着等！等！這討厭的等！</p>
<p>等候了好一刻，明兒的父親才怱忽的回來，氣喘喘地說道：「今夜船僱不到，我們只好宿在過塘行（註）裏了，你們上岸罷，行李已交給轉運公司，由他們負責」。明兒一聽得「上岸」這兩個字，快樂得跳起來，不過他却不敢就跳起來，在心中暗暗的一喜。他們付了船錢，各自上岸了。</p>
<p>「那過塘行是在江干，離這裹是很遠的，呌人力車，這許多人一時也呌不到這許多車，這是去呌一輛公共汽車吧」。明兒的父親和二位先生說着，於是他們到了附近的一爿茶店中，很快的去呌公共汽車了。</p>
<p>明兒一上了岸，舒舒束縛了三天的身體，全身覺得舒服暢快，而更東張西望的看着他四周的一切。街道是寬闊而整潔，兩旁的房屋高大而整齊，杭州的人們帶着好奇的眼光瞧着他們。明兒更走過去看個明白，却被他的母親阻住了。沒有多少時候，父親回到了那茶店中，對他們說：「汽車也沒有，那我們只好呌人力車了「。於是他們一起三十多個人，走出了那茶店。但那有這許多人力車呢？因此看見一輛呌一輛，好容易的呌到了十多輛，大家都坐上了人力車，向那江干的過塘行去了。</p>

<h3>哥哥妹妹—採蘋果</h3>
<p>— 翰靑作</p>
<p>哥哥說：「妹妹！你看對面樹上有許多蘋果，我們怎樣想法子去採來吃。」　有了！我們拿一隻大脚盆來代替船吧。　哈哈！採了許多蘋果。　哥哥妹妹一仝扛回家來。</p>
<h3>白雪公主（六）</h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>這一個黃昏時候，那七矮人回到家裏來，却見他們小屋子上的烟囱裏，忽地冒出一捲捲的白烟來，他們心中的那種驚異，是誰也料想得到的。</p>
<p>他們在屋外瞧了一會，使同聲說道：「咦，奇怪奇怪，一定有人在我們的屋子裏」！於是這七個矮人暫時不就進屋子去，先在一棵最大的松樹脚下坐了下來，舉行了一個會議。</p>
<p>他們交頭接耳地說道：「也許是一個鬼吧!」「也許是一個惡魔！」</p>
<p>那老頑固却仍鎭定得很，沒有驚異的神情，向他的伙伴們訴說道：「這一些兒沒有什麼奇怪，我早就知道了的！我不是先和你們說過一句預測的話，在將近二百年左右，一定要有可怕的事情發生出來嗎？」</p>
<p>「噓噓……要大聲大氣的！」博士警告着，他常常想做伙伴們中的領袖，可是所作所爲，往往弄得毫無交代的。當下他又做出很勇敢的模樣，指揮着伙伴們道：「哼，伙伴們，勇敢些。跟我來！快跟着我來！」</p>
<p>七矮人懷着鬼胎躡手躡脚地向着他們的小屋子溜將過去。那時四下裏靜悄悄的，一些兒沒有聲息。他們擎高了鐵鐘，一步步向前進行，博士走在前面，先自趕到山前，仲手握住了門柄</p>
<p>啞吧，是七矮人中最年靑的一個，還是光着下巴沒有鬍髭的，這時他虛快怯地跟在末尾，走進了屋子。</p>
<p>博士進門以後模素着點上了一枝蠟燭，向四面照着了一遍。是啊，分明有人到過這屋子裏來，模樣兒和以前不同了。</p>
<p>噴嚏指着一把椅子，低聲說道：「瞧啊！這一把椅上，先前明明是蓋滿着灰塵的，現在却是乾乾凈凈的，一點灰塵都沒有了！」</p>
<p>博士也抖顫着聲音說道：「就是地板上也打掃過了。你們瞧一切的一切，都乾凈得好像新的一樣了！」</p>
<p>他們爲了太忙的緣故，這一座屋子，好久沒有打掃過了。當初也曾乾凈過一次，不過何年何月，因爲隔得太久，連他們自己也記不起來。</p>
<p>貪睡這厮，一向是迷迷糊糊的只想睡覺，差不多沒有一分鐘是淸醒的。他的那張嘴也歪斜着，老是像要呵欠的樣子，這時却也提起了精神，走到那洗滌盃碟的溝渠旁邊，大驚小怪地嚷起來道：「咦！有人把我們的碟子也偷了去了！」</p>
<p>快樂接口道：「你不要歪厮纏，他們並沒有偷去，不過歲到碗橱中去了。」</p>
<p>怕羞，向來是不不大開口的，他雖然常常紅着臉，拈着鬚子，可是一句話都沒有。這當兒不知怎樣，却給他發見了一個鍋子，正在煤爐上嗤嗤作響，分明在煮着甚麼東西，原來剛才白雪公主在上樓之前，已給他們預備些湯在鍋子裹了。怕羞忙不迭的把一柄銅匙舀了湯，想去嘗它一口，脫口喊道：「呀，吃的東西，味兒多麼好啊！」</p>
<p>老頑固搶掉了他的銅匙，怒氣勃勃地叱道「不許動，不許動，這裹頭也許下着毒汁。」</p>
<p>噴嚏好似一尊裝了彈藥的小鋼砲一般，忍不住打了一個最長最響的噴嚏。</p>

<h3>工部局一九三八年份　救火會報告</h3>
<p>工部局救火會、上年共接到火災警報及特別警報一〇五六次、比前年增加一五〇次、此項數字、造成救火會成立以來之最高紀錄、因火災（發生於公共租界內及界外工部局馬路區域中者、均包括在內、）而損失之財產、估計共値二百萬零六千餘元、前年之損失、雖比上年更鉅、但因當時之戰事方烈、故不能相提並論、若與往年相較、此項損失、已可謂爲鉅大、楊樹浦區內、曾發生大火數起、救火員因交通不便、難以施救、此爲造成重大損害之一種原因、</p>
<p>因火災而死亡民衆、有三十二人、因特別變故而死亡者、有十八人、此外尚有爲火灼傷不治身死者一人、所有不幸罹難之民衆、除爲火灼傷之一人外、在救火車趕到出事地點以前、業已喪生、不能歸咎於救火會、因火警及特別警報而受傷者、有民衆三二三人、及救火員六五人、</p>
<p>全年所使用之皮帶、共長七十八英哩餘、救火所用之水、共有二千餘萬加侖、比一九三六年所用者、增加八倍之多、</p>
<p>救火會接到之特別警報、共計一〇七起、其中四十七起之出事原因、爲樓房及墻垣等倒塌、急救及醫院兩組之救護車、共出動一五·六一九决、自靴民醫院運送病人之次數未計算在內、因意外事故或急症而出動之决數比前年的增加三分之一、醫院組救護車之出動决數、比前年增加一倍有奇、</p>
<p>中央救火會已設有總管理室一間、收接一切關於火災救護軍及其他緊急事故之警報、該管理室與救火會之普通行政部份隔離、因此辦事之效率、大見進步、</p>
<p>租界東區之狀態、尚未復原、故在前年戰時被燬之滙山及周家嘴兩救火站、未能重新設立、救火會之工塲、仍爲工部局節省大宗支出、該工塲製造裝置車身、並將舊車改成新式、救火會所用之器具、亦大都爲該工塲所製成、所有救火車、救護車·普通車輛·及一切設備、無不維持最高之效率、</p>
<p>馬路上之公用龍頭、均經　時檢查試騐、若干舊式龍頭、業經拆除改裝新式者、此種變更對於救火工作、便利不少、</p>
<p>租界內之各式房屋、共經視察六·七六二次、以便查明其中所有預防火警之設備、有無不合、上年下半年之新建築、比上半年增加頗多、新建築物大半爲臨時性質之工廠、因此救火會必須時時視察、俾可查明有無適當之防火設備、及充分之水源倘有任何可慮之處、一經察覺、即飭令改善、西區居民增多以後、救火會曾收到報告多起、各該報告或稱某處有釀成火災之慮、或謂某處出口阻塞、而生危險、該會據報逐一調查、如查明所稱屬實、即採取相當措置、以資補救、而免危害生命財產、難民問題、使救火會視察員之工作加重、有收容所兩家、救火會認爲可慮、故已派員携帶救火用具、常川駐守、用防不測、領有工部局執照之一切塲所、均經按時視察、各娛樂塲所、尤爲特別注意、各領照人經分別飭令注意執照章程、各種有危險性之物品、如經發現、即令移至安全處所、以防一旦失火、延及隣居、裝於各處樓房中之救火皮帶、經試騐一百餘次、倘查明有任何缺陷、由救火會立時通知業主、</p>
<p>租界內之房屋、裝有火警設備者共計一·五七五幢、上年新裝置之火警設備，業已竣工、經過試騐並已使用者、共十二起、原有之設備經擴充者五起、新裝置之設備、至上年年底、僅有一部份完工者、一百起、</p>
<p>租界內之交通、仍甚擁擠、尤以中區一帶之熱閙時間爲然、所幸警務人員、仍盡量協助、各種車輛之駕駛人、大都均能讓道、因此救火軍或救護車、在馳赴出事地點之途中、被阻之情事頗少、</p>
<p>可疑爲蹤火之案件、甚爲罕見、所有案件、均無充分證據、未能以放火罪起訴、</p>
<p>志願後備隊、正在改組中、俾能自成爲一單位、正規後備人員、將與戰事期間成立之特別救護運輸組併合、各該隊員之基本職務爲救火、但在急救與救謹方面、大半均曾受過訓練、</p>
<p>救火會救護隊、曾出發應救十九决、除於施救若干起冷藏及其他氣體之洩漏事件、電氣之意外事件、以及類似之警報時、均表示其效率卓著外、應救火警、而遇有以烟氣及其他氣體瀰漫、致須用氧氣呼吸器時、該隊之服務、尤證明爲裨益至鉅、救濟股曾施救火警四十八次、該股人員，專注意於掩護、及其他救護工作、故使用特種救濟器具、其結果財物之損失、大見减少、</p>
<p>本局救火會與隣境救火會之關係、仍甚輯睦。良堪欣慰、（完）</p>

<h3>單相思</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>兩性間的戀愛，是要建立在相互的關係上的。能互戀，然後纔能互愛。也惟有能生互戀，然後纔能生互愛。吾則，任你拚命追逐，結果却逃避不了那悲慘的失敗的命運，落得一個「單相思」的譏評。</p>
<p>相思的滋味最苦，單相思的情况則更尷尬。紅樓夢裹的賈瑞的死於王熙鳳之手，則是輩相思朋友最悽慘的結局。有人說：王熙鳳的戲弄賈瑞，手段米免太毒辣。這句話似是而實非。他們祇看到王熙鳳毒設相思局，而忽略了賈瑞的「癩蛤蟆想吃天鵝肉」的意念和行爲是招致死的因素。</p>
<p>單相思的朋友因爲色迷了心，理智也泯滅了。對於客觀的事實，主觀的條件，忘記得乾乾凈凈，甚至得不到對方的反應，還「自說自話」，自得其樂。</p>
<p>單相思的故事，不僅兩性間時有所聞；而今國際間的陰謀，也有單相思事件的演出。譬如說：我們東隣的「友邦」，它們轉吳佩孚的念頭，在一年前已經動過腦筋了。最近更鬧得有聲有色，像煞有介事。誰知據美聯社的消息：吳佩孚已積極參預所謂「和平」運動之說，實屬某一方面之單相思。（見二日本報）</p>
<p>其實，吳佩孚的參預不參預所謂「和平」運動，根本於中國的抗戰前途，沒什麼重大影響。理由是：吳佩孚到今日還能博得一部份中國同胞當作偶像般崇拜，因爲他具有一身傲骨；倘然　顏事仇，那麼便消失了被人崇拜的條件，也發生不出東隣友邦」所要發生的作用了。但是威武不能屈，富貴不能淫，自比岳武穆的吳佩孚將軍，他豈肯晚節不香，上東隣「友邦」的圈套，傀儡登塲？關於這一點，東隣「友邦」何嘗不曉得，奈何在軍事無法進展，國際形勢孤立，國內怨聲載道，和豺華政治陰謀屢遭失敗的苦惱情况之下，纔出此下策，誰知叉撲了個空，依舊是個單相思</p>
<p>單相思的演進，是會成功「花痴」的。花痴有文武之別：文的，痴痴呆呆，不知人事；武的，瘋瘋癲癲，胡作胡爲。結果，不爲廢物，必致死亡。聽說東鄰「友邦」因爲勾搭吳佩孚不成，想轉變方法，探用硬的手段，那麼單相思的朋友將成功武花痴了。悲夫！</p>
<h3>上海人的星期日</h3>
<p>— 李廷康</p>
<p>平日南京路在早上八九點鐘光景顯得是車水馬龍，每一輛東行的公共汽車或電車裹都擠滿着人，大小的職員這時都匆忙地奔向自己的辦公處，然而星期日的早上可有點異樣，每輛車箱裏都很空洞，連候在車站上兜售晨報的報童，也喊得不大起勁，因爲星期日大家公認爲休息的一天，一週來的辛苦，希望在這天上得到調節的酬報。</p>
<p>然而休息在上海人的意義也就是「白相」，到禮拜六下了辦公室，碰到同事就會問：「明朝啥地方去白相？」可見星期日就成爲「白相」的日子，而各樣的上海人便有各式的白相地方。</p>
<p>第一我要說的，倒不是屬於「白相」方面：衹要看上海有迢許多尖塔屋頂的黃色敎堂，就可知基督敎在上海的潛力，這些敎堂在星期日是極活躍的地方，那些善男信女，不顧天大的事情，那天一定要虔誠地到敎堂裏去做禱告，聽牧師宣揚一番敎義，才放得下心，因爲這個儀式。也許是包括着六天來的懺悔和改過。</p>
<p>美國駐滬第四海軍部，每星期日早上十點也假大上海戲院舉行禱告禮拜，參加的極擁擠，有高等華人，學生，中級商人等等，這因爲海軍部在禱告做完後，例有一個鐘點的昔樂和歌唱，而玩意也着實不錯，這樣免費的享受，足使不信敎的也願進去坐二小時。</p>
<p>上海有五十家電影院，六家京戲館，在星期日沒有不告客滿的，這裹顧客是包含有紳士，學生以及小市民層；回力球塲跑狗塲的人頭蠢動着，這裹沉醉了不少然中的人，中上幾個雙獨贏將比每天跑辦公處要來得舒服；邀幾個朋友上茶室作淸談，自世界大勢張伯倫在羅馬患傷風談至隔壁王家小貓失踪，一面又可嚼着自己喜歡的各式點心，自然也是得其所哉的樂事；假使是個好天氣，那末很多背個鏡箱上公園的，雖然軟片價自己飛漲得可怕，而公園也成爲高等難民的收容所，可是公園裹究竟有樹有木有草地的去處。</p>
<p>文化街已是消沈得可憐，不過在這天也仍有人趁此餘暇喜歡來往瀏覽瀏覽，同樣在作瀏覽工作的，是一些女太太和孩子，然而地點却是在幾家有名的百貨大公司，他們貪婪地從這裏看到那裏，再從那裏看到這裏，恨不得把心愛的統統帶回去才好，其實手裏的紙包已經是不能再多拿了</p>
<p>舞塲酒樓在這天總是擁擠得好像希望客人不要光顧了，但客人好像愈擁擠愈有味兒的源源而來，午餐舞不到十二點鐵已在開始，而花彫即使是一元斤也還有人喝。</p>
<p>有的也消遣，有的也陶醉，整個星期日演着各種不同的節奏，「白相」的涵義，倒確是很普遍的被默認，然而也有人似乎不以爲然的，我一眼就看到二個：隔壁看門的王金標，他仍是蠢蠢的獃坐在門旁的長櫈上，星期日對他無動于中；對過單開間門面雜貨舖子的那小伙子也仍是楞着一對眼珠子呆看着路上的行人，車輛……</p>
<h3>記「寒物集錦書畫小品展覽會」</h3>
<p>— 飛馬</p>
<p>南京路大新公司在這一個月來，有過三决「展覽會」：第一决是「藝術叛徒」劉海粟先生的「個展」：第二决是上海美專師生的「救濟難民書畫展覽會」；第三决，就是這决，是在滬首創第一决舉行的「寒物集錦書畫小品展覽會」了。展覽的日期是本月三·四·五·三天。</p>
<p>上述三種「展覽會」，除劉海栗先生的「個展」外，共他兩種的「展覽會」，都是爲看救助難胞而舉行的。這是多麼値得大家的欽贊呀！</p>
<p>「寒物集錦書畫小品展覽會」聽說是聞蘭亭和周邦俊二位先生發起主辦的，集全上海的小品書畫專家的作品於一堂，供人覜賞，並標出價値號碼，任人選擇。價値有從二三起至七八十元不等。但如欲購買書畫者，却須一律繳納六元，購買者可以抽籤，碰運氣得到價値高的或是低的書畫，這辦法確是頗饒興趣，然而眞正在於救助難胞的，常然不會去計較那「運氣」了！</p>
<p>筆者是在三日的下午四時去參觀的。四壁書畫，眞是琳瑯滿目。雖然畫的都是些山水花卉，或是些猛虎猛獅，題材似乎離現實過遠，然而因爲是各藝術家的精選之品，所以就是如我這個「門外漢」看來，實在也眞有「美不勝收」之感了！筆者一邊觀賞，一邊對這些書畫的藝術家，不禁湧起一種崇敬的感情來。可不是麼，他們是拿出他們的精選作品來，爲的是要救助難胞呀！</p>
<p>「旣得佳品，又行善事，」全上海的同胞們—在寒冷的西北風中，當我們穿着厚重的冬衣不覺得冷的時侯，我們會不會想到大羣爲着祖國而受難的同胞們麼？希望有錢的，歡喜書畫的朋友們，不妨去參觀一下，購買幾幅你們所愛的書叢，「旣得佳品，又行善事，」這眞是「一舉兩得」的事了！</p>
<h3>牛郎織女</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“The　Cowboy　and　the　Lady”</p>
<p>聯藝公司出品　國泰戲院開映</p>
<p>「牛郞織女」這影片在本質上講，還是游戲戀愛的老調，它並不能給我們什麼新的啟示，由故事上便可看出它是怎樣一個內容：它說有一個參議員的女兒，她父親因爲要參加總統候選人，便把他女兒許給一個有力的政黨領袖，結果他女兒覺愛上了一個擁有廣大牧塲的年靑牧人，並且很快地和他結了婚。她父親終於也覺悟了，放棄了政治生活，讓她女兒獲得了自由。</p>
<p>由內容上，我們可以看出，它和「浮生若夢」「富貴浮雲」一樣，消極地放棄了事業及政治生活，而來歌頌戀愛與父愛的偉大。實際上，這種槪念是完全錯誤的，就是政黨的競爭假如是基於正義與公道，那麼一切都應當爭取的，假如這個政黨只是想搜括剝削民衆，他們不單不應該存在，而且是應該被打擊的。不過，在這些戀愛至上的故事裏，這種背景，也不過成爲整個影片的附庸罷了。劇作者主要所要寫的，還是那些戀愛的錯綜的心理姿態，與它們濃馥的羅曼的克的氣氛而已。</p>
<p>因此，全劇的重心，依然是寫這位參議員的小姐，如何在牧人騎術比賽會上，認識了那位年靑的牧人，又怎樣在一個「盲目日」隨意戲弄了他一天，直到最後，參議員小姐又認眞起來，認爲她的確是愛那位牧人，於是追蹤牧人之後，兩人結了婚。</p>
<p>劇作者在寫小姐與牧入生活方式絕對不同的一點上，它是刻劃得很成功的，一面是高貴文雅，一面却是粗野而爽直，在一種絕對不同的生活形態之下，而寫下了這兩人的戀愛。導演者對於這些地方，前後都抓得很緊，寫曼麗戲弄史屈里契時，一種詼諧的氣氛，處理得很活潑，允其是曼麗根據她兩個女僕戲弄男人的方式戲弄史屈里契時，它是充溢了濃郁的笑料的。</p>
<p>曼麗自和史屆里契結婚以後，導演者對於曼麗和那種粗野的牧人生活不調和的姿態，以及她的窘態，也有很生動的刻劃，這裹面，更充分顯示曼麗平日生活的高貴，與她的嬌養。</p>
<p>就是寫曼麗不能由星期二回來一塲，導演者使史屆里契在那間正在興建的空屋中間，裝模裝樣的假裝推門，喝酒，擁抱曼麗等的轟笑聲中，而突然送進一封曼麗不能來的電報，它一種由强烈的歡笑突然轉變爲抑鬱一塲，情感空氣的對照，是異常成功的。</p>
<p>在一般技術上講，「牛郞織女」許多部份都很可愛，就是結束，使曼麗先到家，由史屆里契先看到大家在歡的樣子，再介紹曼麗的出塲這是頗有戲劇性的手法。</p>
<p>賈萊古柏似乎比梅兒奧勃朗更深刻動人，幾個配角都很會演戲。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>何雙玉道：『那末這小學生是他的孫兒嗎？瞧這孩子很聰明活潑呢。』金澹雲道：『可不是嗎？說也可憐！他家裏有幾問房子，被肆虐的敵機，炸了一個光。他的老婆，被震坍的房子壓下來，也受了重傷，不治而死。他的兒子，本來也是給人家當園丁的，爲了國仇家仇兩重仇限，便去投了軍。雖然不是陣亡的，却在軍中得病而死，有人說：中了敵方的毒氣。老頭子就只有這個兒子，幸虧他兒子，留下一子一女。女的比男的大三歲，今年十三歲了，男的却是十歲。姊弟兩人，都很聰穎，他們都在遺族學校小學部裹念書。現在的小學校，並沒有什麼考試等等。就是今年的某一紀念日，他們有什麼學生表演之類，他們請我去給獎。那個小學生，喚做黃中，他表演得很好。除了學校中給獎之外，我還到他家裏去訪問了一决，也送了些獎品給他。爲的我家與他們也是舊相識，我也不好再呼他黃阿毛，改口呼他爲黃老爹了。現在這裏有一個小型的集體農塲，總共有三百多畝田，用新法耕種，出產很爲豐富。還附帶了一個畜植公司，也是合作性質的，黃老爹便是其中重要的一員。他深恨從前失學，不曾讀過書，但近來居然也能閱讀書報，以一個一字不識的人而能如此，也算虧他的了』。林建成道：『人只要能虛心，虛心就有進步。况且像現在的世界，各種學問，比了飛機還要快，任你怎樣追也追不上。中國人向來有句話，呌做「學到老，學弗了」，這就是說學無止境的。此刻黃老爹，一個老頭子，倒向小孩子去請敎。我們非但不覺他可羞，我們應該向他表示敬意咧』。金澹雲道：『實在說一句話，我們中國自己太蹉跎了。以至於文盲太多，百分中有七八十分是不識字的。當時我們還記得，有一位陶先生，曾提倡了小光生制。因爲兒童倒就學了，而家長儘有不識字的。於是勸兒童回到家裏，去敎他們的家長。譬如孫兒去敎他的老祖父，孫女去敎她的老祖母，每一個小學生，至少要回去敎兩個家裹人，這就呌做小先生制，行來很有效騐』。三一）</p>

<h3>為日偽徵求電影脚本</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>敬告孤島劇作家</p>
<p>時代的齒輪，不住的向前轉動着，偉大的新時代，無疑的將要降臨到我們的面前了。促進這偉大的新時代來臨，固然需要全民族全社會的努力；可是，利用電影的宜傳，却也是不容忽視的重要的工具。</p>
<p>誰都知道，電影宣傳的效力，不僅能刺激一般觀衆的心靈，而且更能改變觀衆心理。無論在道德上，敎育上，文化上………電影都能把一般觀衆的心理，改變過來。所以良好的電影，會指導大衆走到一條光明正確的路上去。反之，只會引誘大衆墮落，頹唐，消極和悲觀。</p>
<p>在偉大的抗戰期間，我們需要的電影，無疑的是應該含有抗戰性的。我們要憑藉着電影的力量，來提高大衆的抗戰意識，發揚民挨抗戰建國的精神，促成「最後勝利」的實現。這是一條鐵律，誰都不會加以反對和非議的。　然而，正爲了電影宣傳效力的偉大，於是日僞方面，目前很努力於「電影脚本」的徴求。預備把徴求錄取的劇本，來攝製電影，在淪陷區開映用以麻醉淪陷區同胞的心靈。日僞居心的刁滑，手段的毒辣，可見一斑！</p>
<p>虹口某漢奸報上日僞徴求「電影脚本」的啟事，「什麼東亞之新黎明來矣，我們對於所謂東亞新秩序，懷抱着熱烈的關心！……因此，我們一步一步使它實現起來，以期登峯造極！………新中國應當創造新中國電影，於是乎我們需要新中國電影的脚本。穿挿之範圍廣大，不過有企圖柬亞新秩序之建設之表現而已，…」言詞的似通非通，語句的不倫不類，讀之眞令人髮指！是可應微，孰不可應徴？這是劇作家應該切實認識的一件事。</p>
<p>筆者十二萬分誠懇的敬告孤島劇作家，我們要深深地認淸自己使命的重大，畏期抗戰的意義，爲民族，爲國家，爲子孫，我們萬萬不能貪圖日僞幾十塊錢的報酬，而自貶了人格，做出賣民旅，出賣國家的無恥勾當。同時，我們更得進一步的監督同文，用忠實的態度，盡友朋勸告之責，萬一發現敗類的私自應徵，允其應該予以嚴厲的制裁。</p>
<h3>播音生活（下）</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>電台上的電費，是不能欠的，也有先付的也有先付一半的，這全視其平時的信用如何。信用好的，也有到期付的，可是商店的播音費，有時也會牽絲的，不是說老闆不在，定是說過幾天來收。碰着運氣不好，關店大吉，就要吃倒帳，自己挖腰包，賠了口舌叉折錢，電費到期不付，無情的電台老闆就要行使執行權了，關閉機器，停止播音，那時節眞是無可如何，自己會駡起自己來，誰要你吃這碗播昔飯的。</p>
<p>也有幾位時來運來紅得發紫的播音員，居然會有八九擋節目，一天到晚，忙得吃飯的功夫都沒有，出入有包車代步，牌子響亮，自會有人來請敎，那時也會板起面孔的說道：「沒有空擋了，挿不進了」。越是道樣，越是有人來尋着，一個月的進款，最好的也有三四百元錢，比做洋行買辦公司經理還要寫意，但是十個播昔員當中恐怕沒有一個吧！</p>
<p>播首節目的鐘點最遍的，要算講故事了，甚至會播到翌晨四點鐘，最可憐的，就是這些夜節目，聽的人果然是夜神仙，資產階級居多，可是播的人却苦得不也樂乎。同是一個人，何其苦樂不勻。何况又是戒嚴期內，沒有通行證的，播完了音，坐以待旦，或是在播音室中的沙發上，甚至地板上睡一下，等到天亮回去，一路上睡眼朦朧，多麼可憐呀！</p>
<p>不佞對於播音生活快近六年了，所播的節自是故事，幸虧是業餘性質，當做兼職，吾則，那能過活，看到許多播音員的生活，實在太覺悽慘，聽衆們讀了我這篇播音生活，常你們開着收音機聽得津津有味的當兒，感覺到播音員的生活如何？</p>

<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>初學入門（續前）</p>
<p>進改退法，行動時雙足向右灣右足用外邊，（即外輪）左足用裹邊，（即裹二輪）待雙足面右時，身即向右一順轉，重心在左足，則雙足即成反向。（即如面南進前時，足趾先向南轉身、而改退後，行動後足趾即向北。）但行動方向，仍不改，即仍係向南進行。（如欲向左轉，其法亦同。）</p>
<p>轉灣法（甲）右轉灣時身元向右側，二膝加屈，左足移在右足之前，兩足着地行，直至轉灣終如下半圖。</p>
<p>（乙）前法學會後，可用交脚法右轉灣時將左足交於右足之前之右，左足用力於裹邊，右足用力於外邊，替換推進，即成如上半圖。（向左轉灣依此類推）</p>
<p>輪鞋停止法（甲）前進的停止法停止時將一足落於第二足之後，成丁字形，並使二裹輪拖地即停。拖地之輕重，須與進行之遲速成正比例。即快行則重拖，遲行則輕拖，此法須兩足更換練習，直至能隨意停止而後可。</p>
<p>（乙）退後時的停止法停止時將一足提起足趾，在地上輕拖即可。</p>
<p>冰鞋停止法　　用小轉灣法使鞋底之刀口與進行方向成直角。　將兩鞋頭向裏，用鞋之裏邊行使雙趾相遇。　身向後傾斜，使鞋跟之尖頭，咬入冰內，（此係平底鞋之停止法）停止時膝宜屈。　舉一足將該足成丁字式，落在他足之前</p>

<p>金秀山同劉永春都是鐵子筩的出身，秀山是玩的木頭人戲，用被單遮起，鑽在第子裹一個人唱幾個人的戲。劉春是玩澳州影戲的，外號就呌影戲劉。後來都棄了本行，入了伶界，成爲著名的凈角。但是在後臺的時候，最怕人說鑽」字，人家要說鑽鍋，他倆也犯疑，這就同在桂芬怕人說大說小一樣。倘是有拿着一支槍，說這桿槍不錯，可惜就是槍頭大啦，或是桿子短啦，他馬上能同人拚命。因爲他生就的頭大身小，所以最怕人說他的短處，金劉二位幹的本是賤業，當然是更背諱這些了。</p>
<p>秀山是介於銅錘（即大花面一稱正淨。）與副凈（一稱二花面）之間的凈角，他這人的戲德却還不壞。他因爲自己不宜於奸雄戲，所以始終不願演曹操戲，極力避免黃三的路子，因此他所馳名的就是「刺僚」「牧虎關」「孟良盜骨」「御菓園」「探陰山」「白良關」「龍虎鬥」諸類戲。像「法門寺」「忠孝全」這些大太監戲，更是他的特長。他兒子少山，至今仍不大扮演曹操，據他自己說也是遵守他父親遺言的緣故。</p>
<p>劉永春確是銅錘正宗，他與黃金二位全又不同，他的拿手戲是「草橋關」「上天台「進宮「鍘美案」等，允其是一「沙陀國」這戲他更自命不凡。民國十年我到他寓處同他談論些失傳的舊戲，他很憤慨的說道：像「沙陀國」這戲，本是我的絕調，誰想自從鑫堵把牠用「珠簾寨」的名目唱紅了以後，我們花臉行裏也就不大唱它啦，其實他唱的那算什麼味呀？說着的當兒，他不山發了戲癮，一面用手在桌上拍着板，一面就哼拔我聽。那時他雖是快七十歲啦，的確那種沉着的味兒，眞是人所難及。後來因爲義務戲的緣故，此老還同白眉王玉芳合唱一齣「捉放曹」兩人都楚好嗓子，實在令人過　，可是兩人的歲數合起來也有一百五六啦。</p>

<p>Yichuan: The Japanese have recently transported various types of poison gas and artillery to Taiyuan. On the sixteenth, many Japanese soldiers near the Yi Cemetery outside the east gate of Taiyuan committed suicide due to war weariness. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers, with five or six artillery pieces, from Wenshui and Jiaocheng invaded Huokoujiashan, Quli, and Lijiashan in three routes on the morning of the twenty-sixth.

A "Type 94" bomber, number 3016, was shot down by Chinese machine guns and crashed in the Chinese defense area of Pinglu. Two Japanese airmen set fire to the plane to escape, but local Chinese civilians extinguished the fire. Half of the plane's body was destroyed. The plane was worth 400,000 Japanese yen, and the engine is still intact. The two airmen were captured alive by the Chinese army. One was a lieutenant in the air force named Yamada Kiyoshi, and the other was Omori Seizo. The two prisoners expressed their willingness to surrender. That night, the Chinese army gathered over a thousand soldiers and civilians to hold a meeting and put on a play to welcome them. Yamada Kiyoshi spoke in Japanese, recounting how the Japanese warlords deceived their national army and civilians, claiming that the invasion of China was to prevent China's "reddening". He said that after being captured, he saw the Chinese soldiers' fighting spirit and the civilians' bravery, and he began to believe that it was entirely the strength of the Three Principles of the People and had nothing to do with "reddening". He said he was now willing to work to save Japan and the world under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People. Then Omori Seizo translated the Premier's will into Japanese and respectfully read it once. According to the two prisoners, the Japanese military strength in southern Shanxi is weak and is making solid defensive works. They have no power to cross the river. The daily bombing of Shaanxi and Henan is a feint, creating a smoke screen to worry Chinese military attacks. It is said that the two prisoners have now been sent to Luoyang.

<h3>Villagers in Qiaoyecun, Southern Shanxi, Secretly Collude With Garrison Troops to Attack the Japanese Camp at Night; All Japanese Soldiers in the Village Are Annihilated; The Provincial Government Provides Relief to the Villagers in Distress</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Over two hundred Japanese soldiers were entrenched in Qiaoyecun, south of Jiangxian, Shanxi, wantonly trampling on the villagers, arousing the righteous indignation of villagers such as Li Zangxin. They consulted with the □□□ regiment of the □□th army and borrowed hand grenades. They also discussed with Regiment Commander Zhang a joint military-civilian night attack on December 29th. They had previously drawn up a plan of the Japanese military's barracks, entrances and exits, roads, sentry posts, and prepared carefully. All matters such as leading the way, assassinating Japanese sentries, destroying barbed wire, cutting off power lines, and attacking various routes were undertaken by the strong men in the village. Energetic young people were secretly sent to infiltrate the Japanese garrison positions as insiders. When the cannon sounded, dozens of villagers bravely rushed forward.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Severance of Relations Between the Soviet Union and Hungary</h3>
<p>On February 2nd, the Soviet Union suddenly announced the severance of normal diplomatic relations with Hungary, closed its embassy in Hungary, and hoped that Hungary would also close its embassy in the Soviet Union. In the future, any dealings between the Soviet Union and Hungary would be handled temporarily through the diplomatic representatives of the two countries stationed in third-country capitals. This move not only demonstrates the spirit of Soviet dialectical diplomacy and opens a new era in the history of world diplomacy, but also, at a time when U.S. President Roosevelt is elucidating his foreign policy and announcing active aid to democratic countries, this move by the Soviet Union seems to be a response from the West, which is no less than a serious blow to those arrogant aggressive countries. No wonder it shakes the world's attention and is worthy of great attention.</p>
<p>The reason for the Soviet Union's announcement of the severance of relations with Hungary is not a prelude to a declaration of war, but because Hungary, although still a country in form, is actually a vassal of the German-Italian axis and has lost its independent status. Therefore, it is not necessary to have diplomatic relations with her that involve mutual posting of envoys. The Soviet Union's reasons are: 1. Since the Munich Agreement was concluded, the Hungarian government has lost its independence and is dominated by certain countries; 2. The Hungarian government has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, and the interests of that country are not in line with those of the participants in that pact, especially Japan's aggressive aims, and it is clear that it is being instigated by other countries. In fact, it has lost the free will of the country, so it cannot be considered an independent country. However, we must know that among the three Central European countries, since Austria was annexed and Czechoslovakia was slaughtered, Hungary had long been a vassal of the aggression front. It was not until the Soviet Union exposed her that the world knew that she was a country in name only. Moreover, Hungary is currently only a small country with an area of only 92,000 square kilometers and a population of only over 8 million. Although she has the agricultural basin area in the middle reaches of the Danube, she is clearly unimportant in international status. Why should the Soviet Union attach so much importance to her and set such a diplomatic precedent on her? This shows that the Soviet Union's move is not only aimed at Hungary, and the meaning behind the words is clearly of great significance.</p>
<p>First point: Since the Czech incident, the democratic front has clearly retreated. When the city of Barcelona in Spain fell, the aggressive countries were even more arrogant and looked down on everything. When Chamberlain treated Czechoslovakia as a fish to be slaughtered, the Soviet Union remained silent. The countries of the world had a kind of illusion, thinking that the Soviet Union was not a true friend of the democratic countries, and condoned Chamberlain's generation in making that concession. Recently, the Spanish war situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and the situation in Western Europe is precarious. In order to avoid making enemies on all sides, Germany suddenly expressed its intention to improve relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union did not seem to have a firm refusal. All the democratic countries are holding fears. However, at just such a time, the Soviet Union suddenly announced the severance of relations with Hungary, expressing a clear position and sweeping away some of the haze in the world. This will of course make London express its joy, and Schnurre, the head of the Eastern European Section of the Commercial Department of the German Foreign Ministry, immediately stopped his trip to Moscow.</p>
<p>Second point: The world does not allow the existence of many ambiguous intermediate things. Since the Czech incident, the attitude of various small European countries has not been very clear. In theory, the position of small countries is indeed the most difficult, and it is difficult to choose between serving Jin or Chu. But in the end, the environment will always force the camp to be clear. Moreover, under the current situation, the sooner the camps are clearly divided, the easier it is to avoid world wars. Looking at the United States and Britain actively aiding China, Japan's aggressive arrogance has been considerably reduced; Roosevelt's speech, once delivered, has softened Germany's and Italy's attitude toward France. These are all good examples. The Soviet Union's severance of relations with Hungary is a warning to other Eastern European countries, teaching them to quickly decide their own attitude; and implying that, for the sake of promoting justice, they should abandon their rapprochement with the aggressors and jointly maintain world peace. Therefore, after the news of the Soviet Union's severance of relations with Hungary was revealed, both French and German public opinion had the above-mentioned speculation. Romania, due to its own close relations, immediately stated that relations between Romania and the Soviet Union should become closer, which is another harvest for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In addition, we should note that although the aggressive countries can control several other countries, they are limited to the governments of those countries and can never control their people. According to Soviet sources in Paris, the Hungarian people are considered to be rich in national spirit, and this may be able to prompt their government to change its friendly attitude toward the aggressive countries as a result of the Soviet Union's warning. If so, then the justice in the world is still in the hearts of the masses, and the warmongers of the aggressive countries should also be vigilant!</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Planes Bombed Wanxian and Guiyang Wildly; More Than a Thousand Casualties Reported in Wanxian; The Essence of Guiyang Has Been Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) This afternoon, Japanese planes dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs on Wanxian and Guiyang. Official and private sources in Chongqing have not yet received any reports, indicating that the situation in both places is extremely chaotic. According to initial official reports, the Japanese planes aimed to destroy the commercial areas of both places. Wanxian was completely destroyed due to the lack of modern fire engines. Guiyang had fire engines, so the fire was lighter. According to initial official statistics, casualties in Wanxian alone have exceeded a thousand, making it the record for the most casualties in a single city since the war began. The casualties in Guiyang were four hundred. Chinese planes engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese planes between Wanxian and Chongqing. As a result, the Japanese planes flew back to their base in Hankou, so Chongqing was not bombed. It is rumored that 18 Japanese planes attacked Wanxian. Later reports received here say that the fire in Wanxian was raging. At 4:30 p.m., the fire had not subsided. Strong men spent the entire afternoon carrying water in wooden buckets to put out the fire, to no avail. The commercial area of Wanxian was completely destroyed. Burned and bombed bodies were everywhere. The scene was horrifying. (Fourth Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Eighteen Japanese planes invaded Wanxian via Badong and Wushan in Hubei Province.

Three or four places caught fire, and they were still burning at about 2 PM. The initial loss was very heavy.

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, 18 Japanese bombers attempted to attack Chongqing today but were repelled by Chinese fighter planes in Wanxian.

Fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. The Japanese planes dropped over a hundred bombs on the streets of Wanxian, most of which were incendiary bombs.

At 12:00 PM, 18 Japanese planes flew over Guiyang City and dropped over a hundred heavy bombs and incendiary bombs in the city. They then escaped west. The alarm was lifted at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The essence of the entire city was reduced to ashes. The casualties are over five hundred. Cultural institutions such as the Provincial People's Education Center, the Revolutionary Daily, the Guizhou Morning Post, the Central News Agency office, the Guiyang Central Daily business department, and major bookstores such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, and Beixin Bookstore were all destroyed. When the air raid occurred, all the city's military police and strong men were mobilized to rescue, but because Guiyang was originally an undefended city, there was nothing citizens could do but scatter and avoid, so the losses were so great that it was impossible to count them all at once. The city is still burning, and the wounded are being treated by various charities. Tens of thousands of refugees are camping out on the four mountains. The cold wind is howling and the sound of crying is deafening. Everyone hates the brutality of the Japanese planes. (Fourth Day Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Liu Bingjun, Representative of Wu Peifu, Dies of Illness; Chairman Chiang Orders the Issuance of 3,000 for Funeral Expenses; The Ministry of Military Affairs and Political Affairs Sends Personnel to Handle the Funeral Affairs</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Wu Peifu has appointed Liu Bingjun as his representative since 1935 to facilitate contact with the central government. Liu was stationed in Nanjing and was responsible for contacting all parties. Liu was a close relative of Wu and had been with Wu for many years, and their relationship was extremely deep. After arriving in Nanjing, he established extremely satisfactory contacts with all parties in the central government. After Nanjing fell, Liu moved with the central government agencies to Wuhan. After Wuhan was abandoned, Liu went to Hengyang again. Recently, he came to Chongqing via Guangxi and Guizhou. However, Liu was very old and had a chronic bronchitis, which often flared up in the winter. This was because of the long journey and fatigue. After arriving in Chongqing, the old illness recurred and he was treated at Renaitang Hospital. Because the illness was too severe, the treatment was ineffective. He died in the hospital on the 2nd of this month. Chairman Chiang ordered that 3,000 yuan be issued for Liu's funeral expenses. The Ministry of Military Affairs and Political Affairs sent personnel to assist Liu's relatives in handling all his funeral affairs. Liu's remains were placed in a coffin on the 4th. Central authorities, such as Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs and Political Affairs, sent wreaths to express their condolences. Liu's coffin will be temporarily placed in the cemetery and will be transported back to his hometown for burial in the future. (Fourth Day Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Johnson Speaks in New York: Chinese People's Spirit is Vigorous, Determination to Resist is Growing Stronger, Sassoon Observes that Japan is Bound to Fail</h3>
<p>(New York) The US Ambassador to China, Johnson, told the American Chinese Public Association here today that the Chinese people's spirit is extremely high and the leaders are confident of achieving final victory. The Chinese Public Association specially hosted a banquet for Johnson today, and the ambassador delivered a speech at the banquet.

Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, what has strengthened his belief the most is that "bombers cannot win a war." He continued that the air raids are to the public like war is to the soldiers in the trenches. This not only does not damage their morale, but after being bombed, they know what to do. Johnson also described what he saw from Chongqing to Burma, saying that the newly built highway is the greatest contribution of the past five or six years. Johnson also told the Associated Press reporter that he will stay at his home for two days, and then go directly to China from San Francisco. (3rd AP Telegraph)</p>
<p>(New York) Sir Victor Sassoon, who owns huge assets in Shanghai, arrived here today from Europe on the French "Normandie". According to Sassoon, unless the Japanese army is determined to destroy China's economic foundation, the investments of Britain and the United States in China can be preserved. Sassoon predicted that Japan's invasion of China may lead to a famine in China next year. He also told the New York Herald Tribune that the result of Chiang Kai-shek's resistance policy will definitely leave most parts of China completely without food. Even if Japan completely conquers China militarily in the future, it will be difficult to develop China without the economic assistance of Britain, the United States or other countries, because Japan is currently in urgent need of foreign economy, and may not take any drastic actions against foreign investments in China. Sassoon believes that if Britain, the United States and France can severely impose economic sanctions on Japan, it will definitely end the current Sino-Japanese War and force Japan to withdraw its troops in China. Now, the biggest unexpected thing in the Far East is that after this war, Japan, due to various social and economic tensions within the country, may embark on the path of communism, which is more likely than China.

<h3>French Concession in Hankou Disperses Refugees</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The authorities of the French Concession in this city have accepted the Japanese request and dispersed all the refugees in the concession, sending them back to their hometowns for the Japanese army's "revival" work. As a result, the market in the French Concession has gradually returned to normal, and the residents in the concession can also go outside the concession to buy food, and are no longer subject to the previous difficulties imposed by the Japanese army when returning to the concession.

<h3>Britain and the United States Continue to Provide Economic Assistance to China, New Sino-American Loan Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>(London) The local editor of the "Daily Mail" stated that although it is currently a dangerous period in the Sino-Japanese War, according to the information he has obtained, the proposal for Britain to loan to China has not yet ended. British trading merchants will welcome guided economic assistance to China, and the British government is not completely unsympathetic to it. The granting of any assistance will be conditional on the restoration of tariff-guaranteed loans and other considerations. However, regarding loans to aid Chinese legal tender, because of the proper control of Chinese legal tender in the past six months, the advocates have recently increased. When the Export Credit Loan Bill is submitted to Parliament for continued consideration, there may be more news about this matter. The editor believes that private bank loans to China, backed by the U.S. government, may eventually be established in London. (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news from official sources, the Chinese financial mission is currently in the United States, conducting negotiations with American silver companies for a new loan of 15 million US dollars. It is expected to be successful within a week. This loan will be used to purchase American goods. In addition, the loan negotiations between China and the British financial community are also proceeding very smoothly, and an agreement will be reached soon. (4th Express News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan's Invasion of China Determined to Act Recklessly to the End, Steps up the Creation of Puppet Governments, Excludes the Power of Foreign Powers in China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to informed sources, the results of the Japanese Parliament's debate on the situation in the Far East can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Continue the Japanese military occupation in China until the implementation of the new East Asian organization is guaranteed. Attention should be paid to the joint anti-communism. Furthermore, the parliament's debate showed that the Japanese government insisted that Japan must maintain a completely substantial naval force within China's territorial waters, and will strengthen the blockade. The Japanese army is prepared to cope with the Soviet Union's invading forces, and has the ability to maintain control of the western Pacific and defend Japanese territory. (2) The Japanese government has no intention of holding negotiations with the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek, but is willing to assist in the formation of a new Chinese government. All Chinese who are willing to reach an understanding with Japan and want to form a new government can be assisted. The new organization in the Far East must be based on the economic, military, and political cooperation of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, but this cooperation must not infringe on the sovereignty of the three countries. (3) Japan solemnly declares that the economic group of the three East Asian countries is not monopolizing the Far East market, and allows the economic activities of other countries in the reorganization plan, but countries that do not belong to the East are not allowed to have political or military power or interference in East Asia. Therefore, the reorganization of the Far East must completely destroy the outdated systems such as foreign concessions, extraterritoriality, and collective guarantees of the Nine-Power Treaty. (4) The future international relations of China must be determined by the new Chinese central government itself, without the need to convene an international conference. As for the damage to foreign property during the military occupation, Japan is in principle not responsible for compensation, but is willing to handle it with special methods in special cases.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita said when answering a question from a member of the Lower House during the debate on the budget bill that there is no need for a third country to assist in resolving the China Incident. The questioner believed that it was necessary to ask for help from a third country to resolve the China Incident, but he could not agree with his view. The assistance or sympathy of a third country may be helpful in resolving the China Incident, but the authorities are confident that the China Incident can be resolved satisfactorily without external assistance. Japan's expression of this firm determination to the outside world can avoid the possibility of various foreign countries misunderstanding Japan's strength. Arita mentioned the misunderstanding of Japan's finance and economy by third countries, saying that the questioner said that some foreign countries had an impression that Japan could succeed militarily, but would eventually fail financially and economically. He read foreign newspapers and saw this impression. However, this impression did not begin today, but existed at the beginning of the China Incident. In the past eighteen months, the Japanese army has been fighting victoriously in China, and the impact of the China Incident on Japan's finance and economy is completely different from what foreigners expected. This is a fact well known to the Japanese people. The Japanese people must work hard to correct the misunderstanding of third countries on this point. (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japanese Legislator Questions Shanghai Customs Affairs, Answer Not Announced</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) During the debate on the budget bill in the House of Representatives today, a member of the Minseito Party asked the government how it planned to place the Shanghai Customs under Japanese control, and how to use the customs taxes deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. A government official gave a reply, but the wording is currently kept secret. However, according to today's "Asahi Shimbun", the entire reorganization will begin after 70 Japanese officials are assigned to the customs. (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Delivers Speech, Vigorously Defends Chamberlain's Policy, Strives for Appeasement in Europe, Military Force as Backup, National Unity to Seek Survival for the Country</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax delivered a speech in Hull yesterday, earnestly stating the achievements of Britain's rearmament, briefly stating that due to the extensive movement engaged in the past two or three years, Britain has made considerable progress in the sea, land and air, and gradually restored its ancient strength. If something happens, anyone who thinks that Britain will not be able to promote itself well will make a big mistake. Modern warfare is a tragic event, and we must of course suffer losses. However, we have the right to do everything we can to avoid it. The last thing the British people want to do is to eliminate disputes, but if someone forcibly imposes a dispute on the British people, then I have no doubt about their return and the ultimate effect of this move, because the British are inherently unyielding to power. Today, the relationship between the country and individuals is fixed on the basis of freedom and respect for personality, and it has been replaced everywhere by a philosophy that is contrary to what the British regard as fundamental principles. The conflict of this philosophy and the turbulent emotions left over after the Great War have created today's atmosphere, in which intolerance is often regarded as coercion, and tolerance is often regarded as weakness. The British government and the public are now being called to build true peace in this atmosphere. I know that temptation can often lead to a position of admitting failure. It would be easy for Prime Minister Chamberlain to abandon his efforts to restore trust in Europe, and others would have stopped long ago. The Prime Minister has been heavily criticized for his perseverance, but I know that no one cherishes false fantasies more than the Prime Minister. Neither the Prime Minister nor any member of the government seems to slightly underestimate the difficulties and dangers of the current international situation. The Prime Minister does not abandon his efforts to achieve true peace because of criticism in his own country, but the criticism is very little abroad. Even if all efforts fail, Britain will have to deal with the war. We still have a hundred percent right to show Europe the efforts we have made and are making in a better way. This is what I have no doubt about. If this happens, the entire British people, regardless of party or anything else, will unite as one and express their sincere desire for peace beyond any possibility of doubt. They will have unparalleled spiritual confidence in righteousness, and its effect will be immeasurable. Halifax continued that he did not regard war as one of the inevitable things, and cited our country's guarantee on maintaining the status quo in the Mediterranean and Italy's statement after the end of the Spanish war that it would not make territorial demands on Spain. Therefore, he continued, Spain has been a disturbing problem in European politics for more than two years. Britain and France are both worried that it will endanger the important interests of the two countries. For this reason, we attach great importance to the guarantee made to Mussolini.</p>
<p>Halifax then defended Britain's policy of non-intervention in the Spanish war, saying that we are in a period when the usual international contact agencies are quite ineffective, and the atmosphere is often thick, and rumors are spread secretly, almost as if there is a general manufacturing plant that processes and distributes them. However, it is regrettable that unnecessary panic arises from this, and the only response I have observed is that the country is more united and the people are more calm. Regarding the auxiliary reserve service, more than one million people have voluntarily enlisted. Such enthusiastic voluntary enlistment by free citizens to serve the country is a stronger force in strengthening peace than anything else. In short, all the people of Britain are united to defend Britain and are prepared to do what they should to preserve what they consider necessary for the survival of the country. The British people need peace, but they know in their nature that there are many things in their lives that are not worth living without. However, peace is also a responsibility they bear. Hitler once announced that Germany must export its goods, otherwise it would die, which is indeed the truth about Germany, but Britain is also the same. However, what Hitler said that the war was to drive Germany out of the world trade market is very untrue. It is important to know that Germany was Britain's best customer before the war, and the close combination of commerce and finance between the two countries was the closest between Britain and Germany. Why did we then or now want to exclude Germany from the world trade market? We in Britain have never believed that competition is monopoly. We believe that competition in prosperous and peaceful times is enough to promote trade in all aspects.</p>
<p>Halifax then touched on Hitler's prophecy that there would be a long period of peace in the future, saying that my desire to see this fulfilled is beyond what others can. This will give the world a true guarantee of peace, commerce can be revived, the economy can be developed, and the people can benefit from it. Then, all the achievements of the previous century will shine on the future. If the world is always an armed camp, then the current difficulties will always be a burden, but the extent of which is unknown. If all countries do not cooperate to seek common benefits, then the basic economic standards will never be improved. What we strive for day and night is that other countries and we join hands with sincere determination to achieve this progress.</p>
<p>The last thing we want to have is the natural development of trade, so that others can benefit from it, because we know that the development of this trade is beneficial to everyone. Halifax welcomed the coal agreement signed between Britain and Germany, regarding it as a practical contribution to cooperation between the two countries and a good sign for the future. Halifax continued that wasting funds and labor on unproductive items such as weapons, as well as lack of trust and fear of war, can destroy trade. He did not want to discuss the extent to which the difficulties of Germany or other countries could be alleviated by actions within the scope of a country's power, but he knew that if the world was always an armed camp, then the current difficulties would always be a burden.</p>
<p>Halifax then criticized President Roosevelt's remarks a few weeks ago, saying that most of them coincided with the British people's feelings. The British and American people in this revolutionary era should know that resisting the forces that destroy peace must be the goal of all their efforts. One part of Halifax's speech was an analysis of the various reasons that make international affairs in the modern world more difficult and complex. The important ones are the elimination of distance and the increasing sharpness of ideological differences in many things that penetrate the fundamentals of personal national life.</p>
<p>Halifax finally touched on Italy, saying that the recent conflicts between Britain and Italy are the most acute in Britain's foreign relations. The Fascist system is completely different from the British system. Italy has become part of the Rome-Berlin Axis. This is a necessary item for Italy's policy, just as the Anglo-French Entente is also a necessary item for British policy. Recently, the Prime Minister personally reciprocated the visit to Rome, and the purpose was to resolve this difference between Britain and Italy. (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3>British and French Representatives Arrive in Chongqing Today to Discuss Sino-Burmese and Sino-Vietnamese Air Traffic, Basic Contract Signed, Discussions on Technical Issues</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Aviation officials told the Associated Press that representatives from British Royal Airway and French Airway are scheduled to arrive in Chongqing tomorrow to meet with Chinese officials to discuss air traffic between China and Burma, and between China and Indochina. It is reported that the basic contract was signed a week ago by the Chinese government and officials from the Royal Airways. China will allow the British Royal Airways planes to fly over Kunming, China when flying to Rangoon and Hong Kong. The British officials will also allow the planes of the China Airways to fly over the British Burma territories from Kunming to Rangoon. All technical affairs will be taken charge of by the officials of the Transportation Department under the Chongqing government, and officials from both companies. The purpose for the British Royal Airways to come here is to discuss the following technical issues: (1) expenditure on the expense for the two companies' airfield personnel and equipment; (2) avoiding conflict between the two companies between Kunming and Rangoon; (3) setting up fueling stations at Kunming, Rangoon and their intermediate locations; (4) selecting planes suitable for the Western Yunnan flight at 3,000 to 4,000 ft altitude; (5) flight equipment near the frontier and (6) setting up offices for the British Royal Airways in China.

<h3>President Roosevelt Declares US Foreign Policy Unchanged, Opposes Getting Involved in Any International Alliances, Denies Making "Defense Line in France" Remarks, Extremely Concerned About German-Italian-Japanese Collusion</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt yesterday hosted reporters from various newspapers, severely criticizing the newspapers, saying that many of the records of US defense and foreign policy are completely delusional, and saying that the news that he made a speech to the Senate Military Affairs Committee was a deliberate lie. When asked if he had made the statement "The border of the United States is in France or in the Rhineland" at a meeting with the Senate Military Affairs Committee on January 31, President Roosevelt replied that such news must be a misrepresentation. He repeatedly stated that not only did he not make this statement, but it was also not in accordance with the facts. The US foreign policy has been detailed in his message to Congress, its nature is extremely simple, and there is nothing newly added. He knew that the talks that were spread would be praised by Britain and France and criticized by Germany and Italy, but this praise and criticism were based on a misrepresented fact.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt then announced the main points of US foreign policy as follows: (1) The United States opposes complex alliances. (2) It agrees to maintain world trade in all aspects. (3) It gives complete sympathy to any effort to reduce or limit armaments. (4) From a national standpoint, the United States sympathizes with maintaining the political, economic, and social independence of all countries in the world by peaceful means. Roosevelt also said that the reason why his recent meetings with the House and Senate committees were kept secret was that they had no effect. However, there was certain information obtained from intelligence agencies, and if it were released, the source of this information would be cut off. President Roosevelt solemnly stated that US foreign policy is and will remain unchanged, and some members of Congress and newspaper owners are deliberately misunderstanding this matter. (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The debate over President Roosevelt's foreign policy and whether he had expressed his views to the Senate Military Affairs Committee is still ongoing. Although President Roosevelt has denied it, according to the New York Herald Tribune, two senators told people privately yesterday that President Roosevelt had mentioned "borders" and "the first line of defense" during a White House meeting. President Roosevelt said that if war breaks out, these two will be in France. President Roosevelt today accused several senators of lying and fabricating rumors, which not only surprised the senators, but also made them indignant. However, they denied that President Roosevelt's remarks on foreign policy yesterday were the same as those he secretly told them earlier. One senator said, "What I read today about foreign policy is indeed very different from what was told to the committee the other day." (4th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) The secret talks between President Roosevelt and the members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee have been commented on by responsible people here, briefly stating that the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact is now tending to become a military alliance, and the impact is that the United States shares its interests with Britain and France. This expression by President Roosevelt is to contain it. Regarding the establishment of a military alliance between Germany, Italy and Japan, after the ambassadors and ministers of Japan stationed in various European countries held a meeting in Paris on the 29th of last month, the German Ambassador to Japan Ott and the Italian Ambassador to Japan Oletti held talks with the Japanese Foreign Ministry official Sawada yesterday. It is heard that the main points discussed were whether this military alliance should stipulate that if one of the signatory countries goes to war with the Soviet Union, or with any country, the other two signatory countries are obligated to provide assistance. (4th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Pittman Delivers a Speech, Hoping to Contribute to International Equilibrium and Prevent War Before It Takes Shape</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after meeting with President Roosevelt to hear the President's explanation of foreign policy, spoke to the press, saying, "Some journalists falsely claim that President Roosevelt has changed his policy. This is deceiving the people and is far from the truth. The people should not believe it. President Roosevelt adheres to a fundamental principle regarding international disturbances, namely, that the United States will never join any alliance treaty to avoid being bound by it. As for foreign governments purchasing goods, including airplanes, from U.S. private industries during peacetime, and sending representatives to visit U.S. private factories, including airplane factories and their products, this is a common occurrence and nothing to be surprised at. Therefore, it is not prohibited by law. Considering the European crisis, it is undeniable that the United States may be drawn into the vortex. To try to eliminate the scourge of war before it takes shape, one method is to contribute to the international balance of power, because if the countries are evenly matched, then none will dare to take reckless actions," (Havas, March 3)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's speech yesterday has been commented on by various observers, who say that although the President's speech concerned foreign policy, his motive seemed purely domestic. He was aware that the opposition recently exaggerated the government's measures, often saying that U.S. aid to European democracies was no different from a wartime alliance treaty. President Roosevelt, because this was not true, was eager to stop this kind of propaganda and prove that the sale of airplanes to certain countries was just a transaction and would not restrict the country's freedom of action. As for the so-called Senate Army Committee's discussion of matters that should be kept secret, and the information obtained on certain countries' plans being confidential, this was actually to point out that certain politicians should not use foreign policy as a tool to attack the Democratic Party, and to urge the people to take the highest interests of the country as the premise, and that the government and the public must be fully united to deal with the diplomatic situation. In short, President Roosevelt's views expressed to the members of the Army Committee earlier remain the same, that if the status of European democracies is weakened, the interests of the United States will be threatened. This view has not changed because of yesterday's speech (Havas, March 4)</p>
<h3>Germany and Japan, and Germans, Spare No Effort to Criticize President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's "Asahi Shimbun" commented that President Roosevelt's policy of helping democratic countries is very dangerous, saying, "This kind of attitude seems to have the potential to intensify the tense atmosphere, and this attitude is very likely to cause a major war." (Associated Press, March 3)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, Hitler's adjutant Hess strongly criticized U.S. President Roosevelt's statement that he would move the U.S. border to the Rhine. According to Roosevelt, he absolutely did not make this statement. The German side criticized it before the statement was published here. Hess said, "We are deeply surprised to learn from British and American newspapers of a certain idea that the political leaders of a certain democratic country across the ocean have moved that country's border into France to the Rhine. We are really surprised to hear this. Whether this border is in front of or behind our country's western defenses, we are not very clear. The western defense zone of Germany and the borders of the entire Germany are not determined by foreign declarations. We do not care at all which country crosses the border. The British and Americans can move their borders at will. Germany does not want to arbitrarily interfere in the borders of other countries, and is willing to first pay attention to the future and happiness of its people. Germany's opinion is that the people of other countries also have more urgent reasons to pay attention to the affairs of their own countries." The "Volkischer Beobachter" said that Hitler's speech in Congress this week had "driven away the demon of war, but only for twenty-four hours. It is really unfortunate. The world is now trembling with threats, because the words were spoken by Roosevelt, who is regarded by the world as a peace-lover." (Associated Press, March 3)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German-American relations are not very good. Political figures here recently announced that an official announcement will be made to explain this, because the feeling in Germany is that the U.S. attitude toward Germany has not started today. President Roosevelt's remarks during a secret meeting with members of the U.S. Senate Army Committee are consistent with the country's ban on the sale of helium to the German Zeppelin Company, and its refusal to allow German airplanes to land in the U.S. and refuse to allow it to open a North Atlantic air route. The U.S. seems to be gloating, hoping that a war will break out in Europe in order to profit from it, and "seize the territories of Britain and France to enrich itself." The Freie Kampfblatt reported that "If a second major war breaks out in Europe, the United States will exclusively dominate the world's naval power. Once the European countries are exhausted, the villains across the Atlantic will take the opportunity to include the territories of Britain and France." President Roosevelt's so-called "American front line is on the Rhine" should not be interpreted as such. " The Stuttgarter Beobachter reported that "The ambition of the United States is to start a war in Europe and sit back and enjoy the position of world leader." (Havas, March 4)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Slanders, U.S. Ambassador Protests</h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Italian official controlled newspapers wantonly slandering President Roosevelt, the U.S. government has formally protested to the Italian government today. The protest letter believes that the Italian newspapers' wanton slander of the head of a friendly country is actually authorized by the Italian government, because the Italian government has extremely strict control over newspapers, and it is difficult to publish without its consent and authorization. Moreover, the Italian newspapers said, "President Luo's mental health is also unsound due to physical defects," which is especially insulting. It is heard that the protest has been lodged by the U.S. ambassador to Italy, Philip. Moreover, the Italian Turin People's Daily even called President Roosevelt "the number one enemy of peace," saying that "Roosevelt's reckless interference in European affairs and disruption of world peace is a criminal against peace. "Roosevelt's actions" are of great concern to the Italian people's "life, happiness, and future"." (Associated Press, March 4)</p>
<h3>Paris is Not Surprised</h3>
<p>(Paris) Government officials announced today that they were not surprised by Roosevelt's statement that he had declared "the border of the United States is on the Rhine." They specifically pointed out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had never formally accepted reports on President Roosevelt's attitude without receiving formal confirmation. (Associated Press, March 4)</p>
<h3>Britain Continues to Purchase Airplanes from the U.S., 600 Planes Must Be Delivered on Time</h3>
<p>(London) The Ministry of Aviation recently issued a statement saying, "The airplanes ordered from the U.S. government last year are being delivered quickly, so negotiations are underway to increase the number of planes. The 200 Lockheed airplanes ordered from the Hudson factory will be increased to 250, and the 200 Harvard airplanes ordered from the North American Company will be increased to 400, but all must be delivered within the original scheduled time." (Havas, March 4)</p>
<p>(Washington) A reporter asked Secretary of State Hull whether U.S. airplane factories had requested the State Department to allow them to transport airplanes to Italy and Germany, and whether the State Department had refused to issue export licenses because the airplanes from those countries had bombed ordinary people in Spain. Secretary of State Hull did not give a concrete answer, only saying that the U.S. government's position was very clear. In other words, countries that use airplanes to bomb ordinary people will not be given convenience when purchasing airplanes from the U.S. As for Italy and Germany, U.S. airplane factories have not sold large quantities of airplanes to those countries in the past six months.

<h3>Britain Seeks to Improve Business Relations with the Soviet Union, German-Soviet Reconciliation Proved Untrue, Hungary Willingly Serves as a Pawn for Aggressor Nations, Saying Anti-Communist Pact is Defensive in Nature</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the Soviet Union's severing of diplomatic relations with Hungary, Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Office Undersecretary Butler this morning to explain. Well-informed sources here recently commented on the Soviet government's move, saying that Britain was originally afraid of the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany. Now that the Soviet Union has used Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact as an excuse to sever diplomatic relations with it, it shows that the theory of reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Germany is not reliable. This is the most interesting thing. In addition, the German government's commercial representative to Warsaw, Schnurre, head of the East Europe Section of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally planned to go to Moscow, but has now been abandoned. British people are also relieved to hear this. It is heard that Britain will try to promote British-Soviet trade relations in the short term, and the British government is preparing to provide various conveniences. (Havas, March 3)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union's severing of diplomatic relations with Hungary was recently commented on by the government's organ, Izvestia, saying that the Anti-Comintern Pact is the prelude to the military alliance treaty concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is well known in Moscow. Hungary first concluded a cultural agreement with Japan, then recognized "Manchukuo," and recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Although this move is named "anti-communist," it will undoubtedly become a sharp blade in the hands of aggressor nations. The foreign policy pursued by the various bourgeois countries is based on violent aggression, hypocrisy, cowardice, and fantasy. The Soviet Union, with its courageous spirit, has exposed their masks and revealed their true faces, and taken various appropriate measures to maintain peace and national independence, time and time again. Severing diplomatic relations with Hungary is also one example. (Havas, March 4)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital. The semi-official Hungarian News Agency recently issued a message saying that "According to an official announcement, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov notified the Hungarian Minister yesterday that he had decided to close the Hungarian Legation in the Hungarian capital, but this is not a severing of diplomatic relations. In the future, affairs between the two countries can be handled by representatives of both sides stationed in third countries." He also explained the reason for this move, saying that it was caused by the Hungarian government being controlled by foreign forces. The semi-official TASS news agency said that this was caused by Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. Hungarian officials recently commented that Foreign Minister Csáky had stated twice that Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact was not against the Soviet Union. This pact is defensive in nature, which is well known to the world. The Hungarian government had directly notified the Soviet government of this intention, but it was not understood by the Soviet authorities. Until now, although the Soviet government has said that the Comintern is not related to it, now that it has taken this action, the Hungarian government has reason to believe that the Soviet government is merged with the Third International. However, according to past experience, it is only natural for the Hungarian government to voluntarily join the Anti-Comintern Pact and maintain public order with Germany, Italy, and Japan. (Havas, March 3)</p>
<h3>German Trade Representative Suspends Visit to Russia, Reasons No More Than Two</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Schnurre, head of the East Europe Section of the Commercial Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally planned to come to the Soviet Union, but suddenly postponed his trip yesterday. Foreign observers here recently commented that the reasons are no more than two. One is that the economic delegation sent by the Polish government is negotiating with the Soviet Union. If Germany sends a representative to Moscow at this time, it will inevitably be suspected of competing with Poland. Germany does not want to be accused of offending Poland because of this. Second, Japan will definitely be unhappy after Germany and the Soviet Union are close, which is also not what Germany wants to do. As for the Soviet Union's severing of diplomatic relations with Hungary, some observers believe that Hungary has been joining the Anti-Comintern Pact for fifteen days. The Soviet government only severed diplomatic relations with Hungary after U.S. President Roosevelt decided to aid the democratic countries. There is no lack of clues between them.

<h3>Mussolini to Deliver Speech, Berlin Predicts Not Sensational</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources predict that Mussolini's speech today will not be sensational. Italian sources here say the Italian Premier will only address "routine matters." (Reuters, March 4)</p>
<p>(Rome) Fascist authorities said today that Italian Premier Mussolini may not deliver a speech this Saturday, because the only opportunity for the Premier's speech is after the Fascist Parliament adjourns, but the meeting usually ends in the middle of the night, and it is inconvenient to gather the public due to time constraints, so it is expected that there will be no speech for the time being. Previously, it was generally speculated that the Premier's speech might list the satisfaction of Italy's "natural requirements." (Associated Press, March 3)</p>
<h3>Hitler Issues Order Reorganizing German Air Force, Country Divided into Six Air Fleets, Promote Young People to Generals</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to an official announcement last night, Head of State Hitler, at the request of Air Force Supreme Commander General Göring, has taken several new measures for the Air Force. There are three characteristics: (1) Concentrate all air force power under the Air Force Supreme Commander, (2) Promote many young officers to Air Force generals, (3) Reorganize the Air Force control organization and change its responsible officers. Regarding the first item, there are two decrees. One is to promote the connection and cooperation between the sea, land, and air forces, and to appoint Air Force generals to concurrently serve as advisors to the Supreme Commanders of the sea and land forces. The second is to reorganize the Air Force units, dividing the country into six air corps: one corps in the east, two corps in the north, and three corps in the west, and appointing young generals to serve as commanders of the Air Force corps and commanders of the Air Force districts. Regarding the second item, many drivers and air force cadres during the European War, aged forty to forty-five, were promoted to Air Force generals. Most of them were promoted beyond the norm, not step by step. This is unprecedented in the German army. The purpose is to increase the number of military personnel with actual combat experience to serve as generals, and at the same time add fresh troops of young people to the Air Force leadership. Regarding the third item, the Head of State appointed Aviation Director General Milqu General as the Air Force Inspector General. Four new institutions were established under him: (1) Air Defense Division, (2) Training Office, (3) Aircraft Management Committee, (4) Air Force Weapons Committee. (Haitong, March 3)</p>

<h3>Yugoslav Cabinet Collapses, Former Minister of Interior Ordered to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Yugoslav Capital. Last night, four Yugoslav ministers resigned. This morning, a fifth person (Minister of Social Affairs) followed suit. The cabinet led by Stojadinovic has now collapsed. Political figures speculate that Regent Paul will consult with Senate President Korosec on the formation of a new cabinet. Korosec is the Minister of Interior, known for his tough attitude and unwillingness to compromise with the opposition. His appointment to form the cabinet shows that the King's centralizing policy is becoming more powerful. (Haitong, March 4)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Counterattack in the Suburbs of Hangzhou, Street Fighting Erupts Inside Qingbo Gate, Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Only Arrives at Jianqiao, Wang Ruikai Hides in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Hangzhou. Since the Chinese army in western Zhejiang deployed to counterattack Hangzhou, battles between Chinese and Japanese troops have occurred in various counties and towns along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. In recent days, the battles between the two armies in the suburbs of Hangzhou have become more intense, and there are reports of Chinese troops rushing into Qingbo Gate. The Shanghai-Hangzhou train can only arrive at Jianqiao. The following is a record of the various situations.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Rush in and Street Fighting Erupts. Recently, a large number of Chinese troops came to Hangzhou from the south bank of the Qiantang River, and they are all elite troops of Generals Huang Shaohong and Liu Jianxu. Therefore, guerrilla warfare has been carried out in the four suburbs for a week, and there have been great gains. It is learned that yesterday (4th) morning, the Chinese troops there again attacked the city of Hangzhou in four directions, and greatly destroyed along the railway line. Gunshots rang out for a time, and residents were awakened in their dreams. They all fled to the surrounding villages, but were blocked by Japanese soldiers and not allowed to pass. It is reported that after three hours of fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese troops in the suburbs, Qingbo Gate was broken through by the Chinese troops and rushed into the city. As a result, street fighting broke out for a time. The battle is still going on there, so the outcome of both sides has not been determined. It is also learned that the Shanghai-Hangzhou train opened by the Japanese side can only go to Jianqiao from the 4th, and the city station and other places are not accessible. According to passengers who returned midway, "When the train arrived near Jianqiao, clear gunshots and cannons were heard, and there were huge explosions of bombs." Therefore, the intensity of the Hangzhou battle this time is unprecedented since the beginning of the guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Puppet Officials Scatter and Food Panic. After the Chinese army completely annihilated Pengjiabu outside Gengen Gate in Hangzhou, more than 40 Japanese troops of the Watanabe unit in the central town of Liuxia in Hangzhou were attacked by the Chinese army, and half of them were killed or injured. As a result, the Japanese army in Hangzhou was extremely panicked. In addition to conducting a major search of the entire city, they also increased the number of double posts at each city gate to strictly check pedestrians. The Qingye unit, which originally occupied Hangzhou City, has now been completely deployed to the front line to reinforce it. More than 10,000 people from the combined force of the Tsuchihashi and Ushijima units that arrived from Shanghai were successively transferred to the Hangzhou-Yu and Hangzhou-Fu roads, and fought fiercely with the Chinese army. There are only about 2,000 people left in Hangzhou, and the strength is weak. Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Third District Guerrilla of the Chinese Army, posted a huge announcement in the Hushuo area, roughly saying that the Chinese army issued a large-scale general attack order on that day, deciding to spend the New Year in the city of Hangzhou, and advising the general public to leave the war zone within three days to avoid sacrifice. As soon as this news spread, the atmosphere in the whole city became more tense. The general puppet officials were all suffering from being unable to escape. After the assassination of the puppet mayor He Zan, the vacancy was filled by Xu Shouchong, the puppet director of the Social Affairs Bureau. Xu was afraid of being treated the same way, and was afraid to take office, so the puppet seat is still vacant. The puppet governor Wang Ruikai asked for leave due to illness and hid in his home at No. 28 Dongdajie, Panmen, Suzhou. Recently, Hangzhou City is short of rice, and the price of rice has soared. The Japanese army repeatedly forced the puppet provincial government to supply rice, but it was unable to find it. Salt is also in short supply, and other daily necessities have also increased several times. The livelihood of the common people has been greatly affected, and it is difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Attacking Wangdian, Japanese Troops Reinforce. Wangdian Town (18 miles from Jiaxing), one morning, a unit of the Chinese army set out from the base of ××× and attacked the Japanese army barracks and the railway team in the road protection station. The Japanese soldiers heard the police and resisted in panic. The Chinese soldiers and officers attacked with blood and annihilated a lot of them. The Japanese soldiers collapsed and retreated to Jiaxing because they were unable to support their strength. When the Chinese side saw that the goal had been achieved, they also retired to the original position. At noon, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers suddenly came from Jiaxing and searched around the station and captured dozens of innocent young people.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Taihu Lake Attack Mu Du, Puppet Captain Killed</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Suzhou. The guerrilla teams around Suzhou are even more active. The patrol officers of the puppet provincial police team were killed from time to time when they went out on patrol, and even the guns were lost. Therefore, the puppet police are very afraid of the guerrilla teams. The Taizhu guerrilla team of 230 people arrived at Mudu Town, Suzhou, the other day, and copied in from the west fence of the town and the highway bus station. They immediately surrounded the headquarters of the puppet pacification ninth team. The bullets were like rain. The puppet captain Ji Zongxian was the confidant of the puppet commander Gong Guoliang. He heard the alarm and led the team to resist. He was often hit in the head and waist, and his skull was shattered. He died on the spot. It lasted for two hours. Four or five puppet officers and soldiers were seriously injured, and seven were detained. Li, the puppet squad leader, also died of serious injuries. After the guerrilla team completed the task, it slowly retreated to Taihu Lake. The shops and residents in the town were unharmed and safe and sound. After Xi Guoliang got the news, he sent his pawns Ni Tianjue to take 200 yuan in cash to take care of Ji's funeral. The vacancy was succeeded by the puppet team attached to Guo Shuping. After this incident occurred, the puppet district chief Liu Tayuan and deputy district chief Ye Xiaorong were afraid that the Taihu Lake guerrilla team would make a comeback, and led their families to Suzhou to avoid them.</p>
<h3>Heroic Women Rival Men: Guangdong Trains 100,000 Women Soldiers; Officials' Families Take the Lead, Married and Unmarried Women Must Enlist</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Chaozhou and Shantou women have always been characterized by feminine elegance, not much different from women in Suzhou and Hangzhou. Last year, Weng Zhaoyuan was appointed to lead the 8th District militia as commander. He summoned heads of counties, districts, townships, and baojia (local security units) to Jiedong Meigang for training, teaching them how to mobilize the masses. Later, he recruited young men and women for training as grassroots cadres. Two classes, totaling over 600 people, have already graduated. The results of this experiment showed that women performed no worse than men. Therefore, a special women cadre training class was established, initially with 340 students, who graduated in November and were assigned to various villages for propaganda work, serving as small and medium squad leaders. Jiedong County took the lead in this trend, making it easier to organize female soldiers. The treatment of female cadres was also better than that of male cadres. When admitted for training, they could receive a monthly allowance of 25 yuan. These female graduates were sent to Puning, Huilai, Nanshan, Chaoyang, and Jiedong to train women soldiers during the New Year. Rural women, seeing the tragedy of women near Guangzhou being ravaged by foreign invaders and committing suicide by drowning, gradually became determined to expand the training. Realizing that disaster could strike at any time, they enthusiastically joined the training. The first group of trainees was called the "Demonstration Team," composed of wives and daughters of heads of government agencies, district and township chiefs, who first cut their hair, put on military uniforms, and enlisted to set an example. All women aged 16 to 30, whether married or unmarried, were required to enlist, except for those breastfeeding infants or pregnant for more than six months. Each township trained at least one class of 60 women, with a training period of three months. In Xianglong Township near Jiedong, each township had 60 women; in Meinan and Juhe Townships, 100 women each; and in Meibei Township, 90 women. The first demonstration class in Jiedong consisted of 3,500 women. The 8th Special District currently has 15,000 women soldiers. It is expected that by early spring, the number of women soldiers will exceed 100,000. When the trial run started last autumn, difficulties arose. In Chaoyang Dahao and other townships, there was a trend of "rushing to marry off daughters." In the minds of stubborn people, they believed that once a woman became a soldier, no one would care about her. They hastily invited matchmakers to seek marriages in the cities, not caring about the bride price. As long as the man's family was respectable and had some profession, they would marry off their daughters. The matchmakers carried baskets filled with hundreds of red paper slips with birthdates and red sedan chairs shuttled between villages from dawn to dusk. Fathers and brothers were anxious for their daughters, so female instructors went to the countryside to promote military service at the same time. Now, everyone has gradually realized that training women soldiers is for self-defense and they will not be sent to the front lines to fight. The daily life of the trainees is no different from ordinary people. After training, they still return to their own homes to live. Sometimes they practice field exercises, learning to climb mountains, etc. The scope is also limited to the evacuation routes in each township and recognizing guerrilla bases. In case foreign invaders break in, the women will have received training and will not be at a loss. Once, during a camping trip on a small hill, the instructor used the local scenery to point out the peaks illuminated by the bright moon as the safest areas in the future. One practical exercise was more beneficial than lecturing from textbooks. Now everyone understands that there is no need to worry excessively.</p>
<h3>Dredging Accumulated Water in Northern Jiangsu; Deciding on a Plan to Drain into the Sea; Initial Project Requires 400,000</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Jiangsu Province Dredging Li-Xiahe River Channel into the Sea Engineering Committee convened its first plenary session in Dongtai County at 2:00 PM on January 28th. The meeting was attended by Chairman Han Zishi, Deputy Chairman and Director of the Water Transport Bureau Shen Baojun, Wu Lufeng, Chief Secretary of the Construction Department Xu Jiamo, and committee members, county magistrates, engineers, and other personnel, totaling over 50 people. Chairman Han Zishi presented a report. The resolutions are as follows: The Provincial Government drafted the Organizational Outline for this Committee; Resolution: Amended and approved. A draft of the Rules of Procedure for this Committee was drawn up; Resolution: Amended and approved. A draft budget for the monthly recurrent expenses of this Committee was drawn up; Resolution: Approved. A broad outline of the Project Plan for Dredging the Li-Xiahe River Channel into the Sea by this Committee was drawn up; Resolution: Amended and approved. The Organizational Rules for the various River Works Offices of this Committee were drawn up; Resolution: Amended and approved. The Construction Rules for the various River Works of this Committee were drawn up; Resolution: Amended and approved. The dredging project requires significant funding, and it is feared that the construction funds of the relevant counties will be insufficient; how should this be appropriately allocated? The dredging of river ports benefits various salt reclamation companies and field stoves; how should the cost of works be shared? Both cases were discussed together; Resolution: The initial project cost requires over 400,000 yuan. In addition to the central government subsidy of 100,000 yuan and the provincial government subsidy of 100,000 yuan, the remaining amount will be shared by salt reclamation companies and the counties of Li-Xiahe. If there are further shortfalls, a request will be submitted to the provincial government for additional funding. The funding for the second and third phases will be submitted by the provincial government to the central government for continued allocation. The breaching of the Yellow River is continuing, and the initial plans are particularly focused on the storage and discharge control of Hongze Lake, and the diversion of water into the old course of the Yellow River entering Huai, and please conduct thorough discussions to eliminate the flood; Resolution: Request to be submitted to the provincial government, then to the central government for approval and implementation. The river port works of this Committee are urgently needed, and coastal work is limited; relevant counties should organize work teams to assist in excavation; Resolution: Collected in reasonable quantities by the relevant localities. The Li-Xiahe levee defenses must withstand rising water and also concern military matters; relevant counties should be ordered by the provincial departments to repair them completely to prevent major floods; Resolution: Approved. How should the excavated areas of the dikes on the east and west sides of the Li Canal be repaired to prevent breaches; Resolution: Request to be submitted to the provincial government with a plan for approval by the central government to raise and thicken them. The suggestions of various committee members and the requests for consultation from various project commissioners were discussed. Committee member Ma Junqing suggested: Sub-divert the sea openings to actively rescue the disaster. Committee member Chen Bomeng suggested: A notice be issued to the four counties of Dong (tai), Xing (hua), Yan (cheng), and Fu (ning), and the salt fields within the county's territory, to take advantage of the agricultural slack season to conscript labor to dredge the branch canals and ditches attached to the coastal ports to aid in drainage. The above two proposals were discussed together; Resolution: Handled in conjunction with Item 10 of Proposal A. Committee member Yan Zuobin suggested: Order the relevant counties of Li-Xiahe to clear the reeds and willows in the various river ports and strictly prohibit the setting of fish weirs along the river to facilitate water flow; Resolution: Retained. The Yancheng County Government requested discussion: 1. Submit the budget estimate for the New Yang Port entering the sea new diversion river project for discussion; Resolution: Forward to the Engineering Group of this Committee for review and handling. 2. Regarding the order to conscript labor to dredge the upper section of the Huangsha Port project, may we instruct the Huangsha Improvement Association to determine a method for continued construction and then proceed; Resolution: Approved as proposed. 3. The New Yang Port is winding and twisting, hindering proper drainage, and it is proposed to cut through the waves to straighten it to facilitate flow; Resolution: Forward to this Committee for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Travels in Western Hunan</h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>Land and Water Transportation is Relatively Convenient; Miao People are Enthusiastically Patriotic</p>
<p>Gancheng Correspondence: "Drifting lightly in a boat outside of Peach Blossom Spring, with remnant waters and mountains sprawling in view. The peaks along the banks depict the Qin cave, and the full river breeze and moon evoke the autumn of Chu. Drifting far from my homeland, a thousand miles away, I’m disheartened, drinking a cup of wine at the New Pavilion. When drunk, I don’t mind being as I was in the past, chanting aloud several times, looking at Wu Jun." This is a poem the reporter wrote while boating in Peach Blossom Spring on an autumn night. Since leaving Xu last year, the reporter has been drifting in western Hunan, feeling both the pain of national and familial ruin, and being wanted by a certain party. The rural residence is now occupied by magpies and doves, and the family members are scattered across the country. Disheartened by the turmoil, I laid down my pen. Glad to hear that this newspaper has resumed publication, I hereby record my travels in western Hunan, hoping it will be of interest to those who care about the Southwest.</p>
<p>The Transportation and Scenery of Western Hunan are Dangerous. The mountains of western Hunan are continuous, with rolling hills and ridges. The Yuan River is long and flows meanderingly in between. The transportation in western Hunan relies on this line. The Xiangxi Highway, which has been opened in recent years, also runs parallel to the Yuan River. The distance between them is no more than a hundred li at the farthest point, and it mostly involves cutting through mountains to make roads, winding and curving, making travel very dangerous. Therefore, the transportation of goods still relies on boats on the Yuan River. The reporter's long march started from Changde, going upstream along the Yuan River. It took 40 days to reach Luxi, passing five major shoals and more than ten minor shoals. The journey was still less than 500 li, which can be said to be extremely difficult. From Luxi upwards, the waterway enters Guizhou along the Yuan River, while the highway branches off at Sanjiaoping. The Xiangxi Highway goes along the Yuan River via Chenxi, Zhijiang, and Huangxian to Zhenyuan in Guizhou Province. The Chuanxiang Highway goes northwest along the Luxi River via Gancheng and Yongshui to Xiushan in Sichuan Province. This is a rough overview of the transportation in western Hunan.</p>
<p>The Peach Blossom Spring of the Past, Now United in Hatred. When starting the voyage from Changde, it was already late autumn. The river was calm and the water was stable, making it easy for large and small sailboats to navigate. However, steamships can only travel to below Taoyuan and must then run aground. This is because only the section of the Yuan River between Changde and Taoyuan can be navigated by steamships in all seasons. Above Taoyuan, navigation is unimpeded in spring and summer, but in autumn and winter, the water is shallow and the shoals emerge, and sailboats cannot pass without additional towlines. During the summer floods, only steamships can travel, and sailboats disappear again. The summer floods are most severe in the fifth lunar month. The locals judge the flood by whether there is spring snow that year. The flood occurs a hundred days after the spring snow. If there is no spring snow, the water will remain stable throughout the year. Experts believe that spring snow melts easily and cannot accumulate for long. The melting snow from the towering mountains upstream flows rapidly, converging in the rivers, creating a strong current that takes a hundred days to reach, and this has been tested and proven accurate. However, winter snow does not have this measurement. When the reporter's boat passed Taoyuan, it happened to be during an air raid alarm. Although the reporter disembarked and inspected the county town, most of the shops were closed and the streets were narrow, but still clean. A certain unit of our army was stationed there, with thorough defenses. The social education corps was also adjusting its work among the people. According to Mr. Liu of the education corps, although Taoyuan is known as a secluded place, it is close to Changde and has convenient transportation, unlike the upstream areas. The people are very enthusiastic. The county town is on the north bank of the Yuan River, and the Xiangxi Highway runs west along the south bank. The ancient cave of the Qin people, which has always been praised, is also in the mountains on the south bank, about thirty li from the city. Unfortunately, the boat traveled far away, and I was unable to visit. The ancient place of seclusion is now united in hatred, which is truly gratifying. Qin is not enough to avoid; we vow to perish together.</p>
<p>The Yuan River has Many Shoals, with Steep Cliffs on Both Sides. After passing Taoyuan, the boat gradually entered the shoals. The section of the upper reaches of the Yuan River between Yuanling and Taoyuan, a distance of 300 li, has the most shoals. The major shoals are all within the Yuanling territory. Going upstream along the river, the first is Wengzi Cave, then Qinglang Shoal, then Madao Shoal, then Hengshi Shoal, and then Jiuxi Shoal. Among the five major shoals, Qinglang is the most dangerous. The shoal is five li long, and there is a New Xihou Temple on the bank, also known as Fubo Palace, which enshrines the statue of the Han General Fubo Ma Yuan, and the incense is very prosperous. Merchant ships come and go and must anchor here and pray. The locals offer sacrifices piously and call it the Lord's Temple. The upper reaches of the Yuan River were the ancient Wuxi Man region. Fubo pacified the Man, going upstream along the river. Qinglang Shoal was where he stationed his troops. There are many whetstones on the shoals. The water is constricted by the stones, making the channel narrow and the current rapid. When the boat travels through this area, it must temporarily add towlines. Ropes are pulled on the shore, and people crawl on the ground to drag the boat forward. The narrowest part of the channel can only accommodate one boat. When the reporter arrived here, there were sails like a forest between the mouth of the shoal and Dongting Creek, a distance of five li, all waiting to cross the shoal in order. Only our boat, being light and small, passed through calmly without delay. I heard that some people waited for a month and still had not set sail. The dredging of the shoals cannot be delayed. The Wengzi Cave waterway downstream is also narrow, but the shoal is short and easy to pass. The Madao, Hengshi, and Jiuxi Shoals upstream have rapid currents and wide channels, so there is no stopping of boats. However, all the shoals have steep cliffs on both sides. The road is narrow and steep. The shore road of Wengzi Cave is very steep, with stones cut and iron chains attached for climbing. It was repaired by the prefect of Chenzhou in the Qing Dynasty during the Kangxi era and was originally over three hundred zhang long, but it is now incomplete. People carry towlines and climb ashore, holding the chains to prevent tipping, slithering and crawling forward. The locals do this for a living. One towline earns three or four jiao, and the helmsman earns twice that. The old practice for small shoals was to pay one bowl of rice for one towline. The Hengshi Shoal waterway is wide and requires water towlines. The towmen carry the ropes and wade through the water, which is deep to the thighs. In the severe winter, it is often like this, truly getting used to it and being content with it.</p>
<p>Yuanling Area is Densely Populated. Yuanling was the seat of the Chenzhou Prefecture in the Qing Dynasty. The city is on the north bank, built against the mountain, and its terrain is majestic. The current Hunan Provincial Government is located here. The south bank is the bus station, and the area is densely populated, making it the most important town in western Hunan. The society and culture are highly developed. There used to be the Yuantao and Chenzhong newspapers, and recently the Zhongbao and the Guomin Daily, which was moved from Changsha, have been added, and the circulation is wide. News from western Hunan is centered here. According to Mr. Cai of the social education corps, the local people are very intelligent, and education is going smoothly. National consciousness is strong, and donations are made enthusiastically to relieve the national crisis. Above this, in the territory of Luxi, there are Miao people interspersed, who are fierce and difficult to govern. However, they are rich in traditional ideas. Chen Quchen, the director of the Hunan Xing Shu, is highly trusted by the Miao people. Now that Chen has relocated the Xiangxi Sui Shu to Gancheng, it is even more convenient to govern the Miao people. The area that was once regarded as a mysterious area by the Chinese people will be thoroughly developed here. As for the waterway, it becomes smooth again after passing Yuanling. The boat travels for a day to reach Lu, Luxi is a tributary of the Yuan River, and the county town is prosperous. Boats coming from upstream anchor here. The reporter changed to a car here to go to Gancheng, which took three hours. The car traveled on the mountainside, overlooking the stream, which is the Chuanxiang Highway. Compared with the Xiangxi Highway above Sanjiaoping, it is still relatively flat. Only small boats can row on the waterway. The Chuanxiang Highway is the only reliance for transportation.</p>
<p>The Living Conditions of the Miao People in Western Hunan. Gancheng is surrounded by mountains on all four sides, and the city is built with stone, small but strong. The highway is fifteen li east of the city, and a branch road connects to the county town. Miao people from the surrounding villages live interspersed. Within ten li, they are all civilized Miao, and outside thirty li, you can see the raw Miao. The civilized Miao wear blue cloth headscarves, barefoot and wearing straw sandals. The men's clothing is not much different from that of the Han people, while the women still wear Qing Dynasty styles and like to wear silver ornaments, with necklaces and chains covering their chests. They can also speak Chinese when buying and selling in the market. The raw Miao live in the mountains and rarely enter the market. Both raw and civilized Miao like to drink duck blood. There are bowls of blood in the shops, and the Miao people drink it freely. Both men and women are good at walking and can climb mountains like flying. They used to use Sichuan copper yuan, but recently, through the efforts of the Sui Shu, they all use legal tender. The local people fully support the legal tender policy, and the credit is obvious. Recently, it has also been used among the Miao people, and the Miao people's anti-Japanese sentiment is also very high, thanks to Chen's order. The primary and secondary school teachers service corps has achieved good results in social education work in Gan. This year, on New Year's Day, Zhang Zhizhong inspected western Hunan and was warmly welcomed by all walks of life in Gan. In the evening, local people held a torchlight parade, fully demonstrating the high tide of national spirit, which is truly gratifying for the people of the country. In the future, I will go deep into the Miao region and there will be more good news, which will be recorded for the readers.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Wuzhen Have Recovered Their Original Positions</h3>
<p>Wuzhen Correspondence: Recently, the Chinese military positions in this area and Gumu, Xinpu, Xinshi, and other places were suddenly attacked by Japanese troops. Zhang, Wang, and other units under the command of He Song repelled them. However, the general in charge of the area gave up the positions for strategic reasons, and they were occupied by Japanese troops. According to reliable sources, the area has been recaptured by Chinese troops and all the Japanese troops have been surrounded and annihilated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Haining Attacked in Maqiao</h3>
<p>Haining Correspondence: The Yamaguchi Unit of the Japanese Army in Xiashi, more than 400 people, has been forcibly dragging farmers to build defensive fortifications and setting up artillery on the east and west mountains to shell and demonstrate from time to time, causing panic among the residents. A few days ago, more than 100 Japanese troops, traveling by civilian boats, patrolled Maqiao Town in Dongqu. Chinese troops under Fan Gencai happened to pass through the area and a fierce battle broke out. As a result, eight Japanese troops were killed and Maqiao Town was set on fire by the Japanese troops, and the houses were slightly burned. The next day, more than a dozen Japanese troops went to the Qiantang area to search for guerrillas, looting four villagers and accusing them of being guerrillas. They also went to Lujiahong, half a mile outside of Xiashi, and demolished dozens of villagers' houses.</p>
<h3>Baoying Suffered the Greatest Losses in the Northern Jiangsu Flood</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The flood in the counties of Northern Jiangsu is severe, and Baoying County has suffered the greatest losses. According to recent statistics, the affected area in the county is 180 square kilometers, with the worst affected areas being the 3rd and 7th districts and the 1st district of Yunxi. More than 600,000 mu of good farmland were submerged, affecting more than 300,000 people. Approximately 44,000 people are in dire need of relief. The authorities are working day and night to plan rescue efforts.</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Final: Chen Bangzhen's Two Long Shots Bring Revival; Mixed Team Beats Macklin Extreme Danger, Winning the Championship 34-30; Mr. Jiang Zixiang Bids 350 Yuan to Purchase the Match Ball</h3>
<p>The China Youth Basketball Hall was filled with cheers last night, people were ecstatic, and enthusiastic ladies packed the place. In the final charity basketball game organized by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Chinese Mixed Team, in the last two minutes when they had almost completely given up hope, trailed the Macklin team 28-30. Chen Bangzhen, as a fresh force, jumped onto the court and made two long shots from half-court, one in the center and one on the right side. Miraculously, both shots went in, and the Mixed Team revived, exceeding the Macklin team 32-30. Before the end, Da Yun scored again, and the Mixed Team finally defeated the Macklin team 34-30, winning the championship. The total score was two wins to one. In the first game, the Mixed Team beat the Macklin team 28-20. In the second game, the Macklin team beat the Mixed Team 28-25. In the third game, the Mixed Team beat the Macklin team 34-30.</p>
<p>The Mixed Team Turns Danger into Safety</p>
<p>Last night, the overall situation of the Mixed Team was extremely unfavorable and almost entirely under the control of the Macklin team. In the first half, they trailed 7-4 and made great efforts to counterattack, only exceeding the score twice by one point, making it 10-9 and 11-10. But the result of the first half was still 11-12, one point behind the Macklin team. Coming on in the second half, the Macklin team was aggressive, scoring three goals in a row to make it 18-11. From then on, they led all the way, with the Mixed Team trailing behind. At 27-19, they trailed by as many as eight points, making everyone sweat for the Mixed Team. Chen Xianglong had already been penalized out in the first half, and Li Zhenzhong was also penalized out at this time. However, the Mixed Team turned defeat into victory in despair, which was really fortunate, and extremely dangerous. The Macklin team performed well last night, using a five-man zone defense once in the first half, attacking more than defending overall. The Mixed Team had many openings, but fortunately, the Macklin team's shooting was inaccurate and they failed to seize the opportunities under the basket countless times, which was also one of the reasons for their defeat. Both Bryce was penalized out first and the main player, Pace, was penalized out later, so the overall situation was gone. Otherwise, Chen Bangzhen's two shots would have been impossible to perform. Li Zhenzhong of the Mixed Team performed extremely well last night, scoring a total of 13 points, which was the highest score. He scored four times in the second half, saving the overall situation and his contribution cannot be denied. The total number of fouls by both sides last night reached 27, with four people penalized out, which shows how fierce the competition was.</p>
<p>Jiang Zixiang Generously Donates</p>
<p>During the break, Mr. Xi Yushu auctioned the match ball, and enthusiastic people competed with each other. The bidding started at 50 yuan and increased to 300 yuan. Colonel Feigen, a Macklin officer, suddenly added to a huge price of 325 yuan, which is commendable. Mr. Jiang Zixiang, the manager of Fenxing Real Estate Company, was not willing to be left behind and finally bought it for 350 yuan. The ball was signed by Mr. Yu and all the players as a souvenir. The ball was donated by China United Assurance Company. After the game, Jiang Yiping gave a thank-you speech, and Yu Qiaqing's son, Shunmao, gave the awards. In addition to the championship flag won by the Mixed Team, Macklin, Paramount, China United, and Guoguang each received a prize flag, and each participating player received a commemorative medal. The referees Qu Honglu and Bo Latu officiated. The Mixed Team first sent Chen (Xianglong, Xuechong), Cai, Li, and Sun to the field, while the Macklin team responded with Wang and Bryce. Xuechong made a basket under the net, opening the record. Wilde fouled, the big cat made the free throw, Bryce scored, and Zhenzhong immediately returned a point, making it 4-2. Xianglong invaded and Blien made the free throw. Saqin made two shots in the evening, exceeding the score at 7-4. Zhenzhong tried the basket and the net was penetrated. Blien and Xuechong successively made free throws. Macklin called a timeout and transferred McTaggart Moore to replace Wilde. Pearlman also scored one point, and the Mixed Team also brought in Zhou Dayun to replace Li Zhenzhong. Cai and Bryce each scored one point, Xianglong threw it in, and took the lead again at 10-9. At this time, Macklin attacked fiercely but failed, shooting continuously without success. Xianglong was fouled four times and left the court, causing Blien to tie the score. Zhenzhong shot out another point, and McTaggart also scored a goal. In the first half, Macklin scored 12 and the Mixed Team scored 11.</p>
<p>A-Bangzhen Brings Revival</p>
<p>Continuing the battle, the Macklin's momentum became even more fierce. Blien scored and Pearlman shot two free throws, scoring six points in one go. Li Zhenzhong's wonderful shot was successful, winning two goals. The Macklin's first momentum was not good, and he hurriedly called a timeout. Sure enough, he won back four points. Xuechong and Blien each showed their skills, making it 24-17. The Mixed Team then replaced Zhou Yun Dayun with Shen Yugong. Then, the Macklin team took the lead with 27-19. Zhenzhong and Xuechong scored and penalized successively, making it 24-27. Blien committed four fouls and was penalized off the field. Moore joined the battle. After Zhenzhong scored a goal, he was also penalized for four fouls and left the field, and Dayun was transferred to the field. Pasgu made one of two free throws. Blien was also dismissed for four fouls. McTaggart scored as soon as he entered the field. The Mixed Team urgently replaced Li Zude, who had not been in the field for long, with Chen Bangzhen. After Dayun tied it to 28-30, there was still a difference of two points. Everyone was worried and the time was approaching. How could they know that Bangzhen's half-court long shot would result in each 30 bull-equal battle? Bangzhen used the same trick again, laying the foundation for the victory. When Da Yun threw in the last goal, the gong sounded, and the Mixed Team won the final victory with 34-31.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Fabricate Suspicions, Arrest Yenching University Students in Beiping; Students Bedridden in Hospitals Also Arrested</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that alumni of Yenching University in Beiping received letters yesterday (the 3rd) stating that the Japanese authorities in Beiping fabricated suspicions and arrested Yenching University students. There are at least four students who have been arrested. One of them was detained for a month. Before being released, he was cruelly treated by Japanese officers. Fortunately, the victim's health was not seriously affected. Another student was arrested by the Japanese on December 12th last year while he was bedridden in a hospital. The university tried its best to secure his release, but to no avail. The letter also stated that, according to university staff, the students who were arrested by the Japanese did not participate in any political activities that violated university rules. They believe that the arrests were made because the Japanese secret service obtained secret information. University staff believe that the Japanese, based on personal suspicion, presented false evidence to the arrested students. Yenching University will continue to hold classes in Beiping and adopt a "wait and see" policy. The letter expresses hope that the university will make a more permanent policy decision in the spring. The letter ends by urging alumni and university staff in non-guerilla areas to work together to find jobs for graduates, as graduates are unwilling to work in North China, making the job situation quite serious. University president Dr. Stuart is expected to come to the South in March.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Tianjin Gang Enters Market; Cash Suddenly Turns Downward; Re-enters the 50 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash dark market suddenly turned weak. The reason was that the Tianjin Gang suddenly heard that the gold price there had fallen back to around 2050 yuan, making it difficult to obtain heavy profits. Therefore, the long positions they had entrusted to the securities gangs in the past two days were all sold off. In addition, a certain gold company also came to sell off. Although a certain money exchange company was trying to buy on behalf of the wealthy in the city, there was still more supply than demand, which led to the price falling. However, the price rose slightly at one point because the Hong Kong Gang suddenly entrusted a certain jewelry store and a certain money exchange company to search for purchases. However, the demand could not match the supply, so it was difficult to maintain for long. As a result, it fell back by nine yuan, and the morale of all parties was slightly tired. Transactions were flat, only 600 taels. Jewelry gold also fell back by a small one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable as before.</p>
<p>Real Gold Falls Back by Nine Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, although it was heard that the foreign exchange was tight, the opening price was weak because the securities gangs were selling. A certain money exchange company first entered 50 taels to the jewelry gang, with an opening price of 2051 yuan, which was five yuan lower than the previous day. Then, the securities gang entered 50 taels, priced at 50 yuan. Afterwards, because the securities gang on behalf of the Tianjin Gang was very willing to sell, and a certain money exchange company absorbed purchases, the price fell. The securities gang sold 50 taels to the jewelry gang, priced at 46 yuan, and sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange company, priced at 44 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to the jewelry gang, priced at 43 yuan (it was heard that the purchases made by a certain money exchange company were mostly on behalf of the wealthy in the city). During this period, another money exchange company suddenly entered fiercely on behalf of the Hong Kong Gang, and the securities gang had stopped selling and was watching from the sidelines, so the price jumped up, entering 50 taels to the jewelry gang, priced at 47 yuan, and 50 taels to the cash company, priced at 49 yuan. A certain jewelry store also bought 100 taels on behalf of the Hong Kong Gang, and the price was the same. All were supplied by a certain gold company. 50 taels were also entered to the cash company, priced at 48 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange company was also searching for purchases on behalf of the wealthy in the city, entering 30 taels to the gold company, priced at 50 yuan, and entering 50 taels to the gold company, priced at 49 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, because there was no foreign exchange market, transactions turned quiet. However, the price became weak again because the selling intention of the securities gang on behalf of the Tianjin Gang revived, and those who entered had no stomach for it. Only at about 2:30 PM, the money exchange company sold 20 taels to the gold company, priced at 45 yuan. Afterwards, the securities gang on behalf of the Tianjin Gang still wanted to sell late, so the entrants were even rarer, so the selling price was shouted down to 42 yuan, but still could not find an opponent, so it did not open (it was heard that the lowest price made by a certain money exchange company's front door was 40 yuan), so the evening closing price was still 2045 yuan, which was nine yuan lower than the previous day's, with a full-day difference of eight yuan. The selling price of the cash company's spot gold was 2055 yuan, and the purchase price was 2040 yuan. The current standard gold is quoted about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no opening.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Changes a Small One Yuan</p>
<p>The initial exchange price for jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores did not change, but at 3:15 PM, it was changed by a small one yuan due to the fact that real gold had broken into the 50 yuan mark and was in a slightly tired state. Datong Heng, Lao Qingyun, and others changed the suspension to 207 yuan, and Xin Heng also changed the suspension to 205 yuan, with the purchase price at 199 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Remains Stable and Unchanged</p>
<p>The London telegram of the 3rd stated that British pure gold remained stable at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 7 and a half pence per ounce. The Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remained at 1213 yuan and 30 cents. The listed customs gold also did not move, still calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 8 fen, 7 li. The Shanghai standard gold price did not change, remaining at 1208 yuan and 60 cents.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Enters the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold did not move, and the exchange rate of British and American currency rose by 125. Foreign exchange banks settled slightly less, and the demand for foreign banks in Tianjin also decreased. The Hong Kong telegraph sold well, so the supply and demand were still flat, and the trend was stable. Real gold opened strong, but the market price was high, and collectors profited greatly, gradually starting to sell. The market price hovered downward, and transactions were very active. Transactions were rare in the afternoon, and the trend was weak. Because real gold was weak, collectors rushed to sell foreign currencies, but the decline was very small because foreign exchange was stable. Retail transactions were booming. The Association's transactions were seeking prosperity. Fusheng of the Hongchang company bought 20 British gold pounds, and Zhenxing of the Tongfeng company bought 500 yuan of American gold travel tickets. The father purchased 2,500 French franc tickets from Changtai and Yikang purchased 10 British gold pounds from Hongchang. Yesterday's market price: British gold pounds fell by 1 jiao, British gold notes fell by 7 fen, American gold pounds fell by 1 jiao, Hong Kong notes fell by 3 li, French franc notes fell by half a cent, Singapore notes and Philippine notes each fell by 1 fen, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Narrows by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts continued to decline, generally hovering within 36 yuan per 1,000 yuan. It once rose to 36 yuan and 7 jiao in the morning, then gradually retreated to 36 yuan and 2 jiao at noon, and once retreated to within 36 yuan in the afternoon, eventually settling at 36 yuan, a decrease of half a yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Beijing Foreign Banks Continue to Buy Foreign Exchange in Shanghai, Entrusting Favors to Vigorously Collect to Offset Legal Tender Positions, Exchange Rate Once Drastically Tightened, Hong Kong Electricity Supply Slightly Recovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw Favor Bank acting on behalf of foreign banks in Tianjin and Beijing to vigorously absorb foreign exchange, while Sassoon also followed suit. Therefore, even though there were temporary disruptions in the supply of Hong Kong electricity, the demand still exceeded supply, leading to a drastic tightening of the underlying trend. This initially led to only an eight-point increase for brokers, settling at 203125, and the US dollar weakened to almost break through the 16-yuan mark. Eventually, British gold returned to par, the US dollar slightly tightened, and the Hong Kong dollar also saw continued tightening due to the vigorous buying interest from the banking sector. It is reported that since late last month, rumors have circulated that legal tender circulation in the Tianjin and Beijing areas of North China will cease from March 9th. Consequently, foreign banks in Tianjin and Beijing holding large amounts of legal tender are reportedly telegraphing Shanghai to purchase and settle foreign exchange in order to offset their legal tender positions.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London major cables showed gains in both near and far terms. The silver price in New York remained unchanged, and the London spot gold did not change. The exchange rate of British pounds against US dollars was 06 higher, against French francs remained the same, and against Shanghai lowered by 1875. The US dollar rose 125 against the British pound, gained 1875 against the French franc, and gained a small fraction of 7 against Shanghai. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the early opening of the banks, the spot selling price of the British pound was eight points two five, and the US dollar was 16 yuan 09375, which was the same as the previous close. After the opening, Favor Bank, American Bank, and Sassoon, among others, fiercely competed to absorb foreign exchange. HSBC's British gold narrowed from eight points two five to two one eight seven five, and the US dollar tightened from 16 yuan 09375 to 16 yuan. Therefore, the situation was quite weak. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax revealed a large half cent, calculated at 5.00%. After this, Hong Kong Electric suddenly sold British gold at eight points two five and US dollars at 16 yuan 0625 to foreign banks, causing the underlying trend to loosen. Finally, foreign banks, Chinese-Italian, Dutch, and Oriental banks bought Hong Kong dollars from money changers, narrowing the rate from 55 yuan 125 to 55 yuan. The market situation also tightened. By noon, the selling price of the banking industry was British pounds at eight points two five and US dollars at 16 yuan 0625, resulting in a change compared to the previous close of British pounds unchanged, US dollars tightening by 03125, and Hong Kong dollars shrinking by 25. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Major Cables Show Gains in Both Near and Far Terms</h3>
<p>A London telegram on the 3rd reported that speculative buying and selling were limited, and there was some short covering later, but the market was stable. The market remained stagnant after closing. Major cable silver gained 0625 in both near and far terms. A New York silver telegram indicated that the US silver price remained stable. A Bombay silver telegram reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with no changes in spot, near, or far terms.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Spun Silk Bargaining Reaches 900 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the upward trend in the foreign silk market slightly stabilized. The market prices on Japanese and American exchanges each returned by a small fraction of 1.2. The local foreign firm market was able to develop considerably. Yesterday, Dachang and other firms imported 100 bales of Bai Chang Jing Qi Ba Yun Du silk at a price of 1,480 yuan. Domestic sales of spun silk remained strong, and the silk price remained stable at 870 yuan, with few transactions, as the current bargaining price for spun silk has reached 900 yuan. Overall, the local silk market remains active, and there is still a possibility that the market price will continue to rise. Furthermore, Shaoxing improved silk has been sold for 360 yuan, which pulls the raw silk price up to 1,440 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Raw White Recovers, Refined White Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dutch sugar market recovered due to the gradual stabilization of production prices and the tightening of foreign exchange. The association's trading panel initially priced spot raw white Dutch sugar at 23 yuan 90 cents, but later tightened, and sellers were unwilling to sell at the original price. Some even called for prices above 24 yuan. Re-exported goods rose by 17.5 cents, with 200 bags transacted at 15 yuan 77.5 cents. It is noted that the shadow price had reached 40 cents during the weakest period of the previous market, so the rebound has been nearly 40 cents. Taikoo refined white sugar weakened by another 25 cents due to different circumstances, with B-mark spot sugar priced at 23 yuan 25 cents. However, the decrease seemed excessive, so the market saw tighter hands among sellers. The domestic sugar number panels opened sporadically with little price movement, while Shantou red sugar showed slight weakness, with a possible loosening trend.</p>
<h3>Businessmen Discuss Helping "United Bank" Ceaselessly Absorb Foreign Exchange - What Countermeasures Should Be Taken?</h3>
<p>— Wang Lie Wang</p>
<p>Recent reports have stated that the "puppet United Bank" is heavily absorbing foreign exchange, causing the Shanghai foreign exchange black market to suddenly tighten. As a result, Hong Kong Electric and Chinese banks are competing to sell foreign exchange, which has slightly suppressed the rising trend. This matter is of great importance, and the financial authorities should urgently change their policies to resist the enemy's conspiracy.</p>
<p>Since the central government implemented foreign exchange controls last year, the black market exchange rate plummeted and then stabilized between 8 points and above for British pounds and 15 to 16 yuan for US dollars. However, the flow of legal tender into enemy territory cannot be completely prevented, and capital flight continues to increase. The enemy's intention to destroy the legal tender base is becoming more urgent, and the "puppet United Bank" vigorously absorbing foreign exchange is one type of direct enemy attack. We cannot retaliate, nor can we dig deep trenches and build high fortresses. Instead, we are sacrificing ourselves to maintain the black market, a goal that can be said to be diligently pursued. We surmise that the authorities intend for the Shanghai black market to remain a point of connection for international finance. If it is not maintained, it will not only harm the commercial interests of friendly nations, but also completely destroy the external credit of legal tender. Therefore, we do not use direct defensive measures, but instead try to restrict the flow of legal tender into enemy hands. However, the fact that the flow of legal tender into enemy hands cannot be completely prevented is obvious, resulting in the disheartening phenomenon of the enemy selling to us and us buying from them in the foreign exchange black market. The result is that we are using our foreign resources to subsidize the enemy, and nothing could be more disheartening!</p>
<p>Change foreign trade to state-owned;</p>
<p>Abandon the policy of maintaining the foreign exchange black market;</p>
<p>I would like to suggest the following two major plans to resist this:</p>
<p>How should these two plans be implemented? What are the difficulties? What will be the results? Please discuss each point in detail.</p>
<p>The purpose of changing foreign trade to state-owned is to centralize export foreign exchange, increase foreign resources, and prevent export foreign exchange from being obtained by the enemy or used by unscrupulous merchants for unnecessary imports. Last year, the Ministry of Finance implemented controls on export foreign exchange, stipulating that foreign exchange from over 20 types of important exports must be sold to national banks. Later, this was reduced to over 10 types to encourage increased exports. The authorities must have had their own unavoidable difficulties in this. However, it is clear that this will not help the overall situation. State-owned trade is a policy that must be adopted during the war of resistance. This policy is more effective than controlling export foreign exchange, and the difficulties will not be greater. The implementation steps only require reorganizing the existing Trade Adjustment Committee into a Foreign Trade Bureau, establishing branch bureaus in various places, and further subdividing these bureaus into sub-bureaus and offices to directly purchase export goods and provide a more favorable price. The capital can be requested from various banks. This will not only achieve the above-mentioned goals, but also reduce the exploitation of middlemen and benefit farmers' incomes. However, economic administration is most prone to corruption, which can lead to a loss of trust among the people. The success or failure of this plan depends on this, so investigations and inspections must be especially strict, and offenders must be punished with the death penalty, regardless of the amount involved. Some may argue that most of China's export business is monopolized by foreign firms from friendly nations, and this policy may conflict with them. To gain international assistance, this should be avoided. There is some merit to this view. However, in reality, foreign exporters in the interior have been unable to do much. Since the Yangtze River has not been opened and railway transport in the war zone is impossible, the current export firms are not comparable to those before the war, and their interests have already been destroyed and seized by the enemy. Therefore, our state-owned trade is not taking back rights from export firms, but rather doing what export firms cannot or are unwilling to do. This will not only avoid conflict with them, but also benefit foreign importers, as they can still obtain supplies from China.</p>
<p>Abandoning the policy of maintaining the foreign exchange black market. As mentioned above, our intention in maintaining the black market is sincere. However, for the sake of a long-term war of resistance, foreign resources can no longer be used to maintain foreign exchange in the black market. The enemy's absorption of foreign exchange can no longer be prevented by restricting the flow of legal tender into occupied areas or by using exchange transfers for payment. The amount of legal tender in enemy territory is large and increasing. Currency is not comparable to goods, as it is permanently in the process of circulation. When the enemy sells legal tender to the exchange market to obtain foreign exchange, the exchange market still circulates and expels it, filling the market with enemy goods. It is not difficult for legal tender to indirectly fall into the hands of the enemy, who then exchanges it for foreign exchange on the black market, willing to pay a high price. How can the black market be maintained for long with this constant exchange? It is estimated that the foreign exchange balance of payments in occupied areas, with the huge trade surpluses in Shanghai and Tianjin, was still the highest among all ports nationwide at the end of last year. In this turbulent situation, short-term capital outflows are obviously greater than inflows, and the failure of supply and demand in the black market to offset each other is conceivable. Under the enemy's conspiracy, this deficit will be difficult to make up. For now, the authorities should follow the method of refusing to pay foreign debt principal and interest secured by customs duties and issue a public announcement to the banks of friendly nations: "The Central Bank will no longer supply foreign exchange to avoid being absorbed by the enemy." This move will be a fatal blow to the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, and may cause drastic changes in the black market exchange rate. However, the impact will not be as serious as imagined. First, in this time of survival, friendly nations will understand any reasonable self-defense policy. Second, as long as we control the vicious expansion of currency and maintain the external credit of legal tender as usual, the external exchange rate of legal tender can be prevented from drastically falling due to the effect of purchasing power parity. Third, the government's purchases of military supplies from foreign countries will not be affected by the black market exchange rate, as its external payments will be directly transferred from the Central Bank's foreign exchange account and will not require the purchase of foreign exchange from the black market. However, the Central Bank's foreign balance must be constantly replenished, which is why foreign trade must be state-owned. Fourth, changes in the black market exchange rate will not hinder loans from friendly nations, as our foreign loans are calculated in foreign currency, and creditors will not suffer losses due to changes in the exchange market.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be clarified that we at the Central Bank are maintaining the foreign exchange black market, which is not something that outsiders dare to say. However, judging from the situation of the Shanghai black market, there is no doubt that the supply side is being maintained. If those maintaining it are not the Central Bank, then there is no need to discuss it. If it is us, then there is a need to consider whether we should continue to maintain it. With the Central Bank's careful consideration and steady implementation of policies in recent years, it is likely already in the planning stages. Could it be that the British and American loans have conditions for maintaining the black market exchange rate? If so, this is not a good policy for the British and Americans either, as the black market can only be temporarily maintained, while the loans are limited in number. The benefits of the loans will then be transferred to the enemy, a result that friendly nations would definitely not want.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Yarn Market Supported by Customer Sales, Stockpilers Even More Enthusiastic, No One Willing to Sell Shuangma</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to advance with increasing momentum. The Nan Hua, Shantou, and Yunnan gangs are again active in the sales of coarse and fine yarn, with busy purchasing and enthusiastic sentiment, causing people to feel anxious again. The market situation is slowly rising. Regarding peers, in view of the improvement in actual demand, the idea of searching for and bidding up prices is becoming more intense. In addition, the financial community is optimistic, and this customer sales development further supports the intention to stockpile. In general, retail investors, because the closing period of the abolished years is approaching, want to take profits as soon as possible and avoid risk. Therefore, the market shows a hard but smooth trend.</p>
<p>Coarse Yarn Alone Rises by Five Yuan</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened with a lively atmosphere this morning, with customers already placing orders. Therefore, the image was not as sluggish as the previous day. Brokers were still quickly moving around, as both the Yunnan and Shantou gangs had received telegrams from Shanghai to purchase goods at the market price, plus five cents. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 396.5 yuan. The Hong Kong gang imported 90 bales. After this, the Chao and Dian gangs continued to absorb yarn, and the market price was driven up by this actual transaction. The price of Shuangma yarn was 398 yuan. Finally, someone increased the price to buy more, but no one was willing to sell and no transaction occurred. As a result, the total transaction volume in the morning was 1,570 bales, with transactions by peers and group customers accounting for more than half. The market price of 20-count Shuangma was two yuan higher than the previous day, Te Jincheng rose by three yuan, Flying Tiger rose by three yuan, Tiannu rose by one yuan, and Shuang 지구 rose by one yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn saw particularly strong Yunnan gang demand, and alone rose by five yuan. The factory, Yong'an Factory, opened 50 bales of 20-count Te Jincheng at a price of 400 yuan. Exports included 390 pieces to Haiphong, 75 pieces to Hong Kong, 310 pieces to Shantou, and 20 pieces to Yantai. The transaction volume of each gang is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yunnan 38  Five Peers  815</p>
<p>Hong Kong  90  Shantou  250</p>
<p>Wenzhou  15  Inland  10</p>
<p>Ningbo  5  Total 1,570</p>
<p>Factory Opens 3,400 Bales</p>
<p>British Jardine Matheson Yangshupu, Gongyi, and San yarn factories opened a total of 2,300 bales of 42-count Samsung, 32-count Samsung, 20-count Shepherd, 20-count Wufu, 20-count Samsung, and 6-count Rouge Tiger yarn. All of these are said to be cash prices. Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 2 also opened more than 1,000 bales of 20-count Danu yarn at a price of 400 yuan, with delivery scheduled for March and April. The buyer must pay a deposit of 40 yuan per bale.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Relies Only on the Local Market</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market saw sluggish transactions, except for weak demand in the local market. The market price was stable. The spot price of 20-count Suigetsu yarn was 326 to 327 yuan, and the price for the following month was 332 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 321 to 322 yuan, and the price for the following month was 328 yuan.</p>

<h3>Xin Sheng Yarn Factory Purchases Raw Cotton on the Market</h3>
<p>American Cotton Orders to Arrive Next Week</p>
<p>Local cotton business is still sluggish and not smooth. Foreign cotton factories and cotton merchants are purchasing again due to cheap prices. Shenxin Factory has recently opened up a lot of cotton yarn, and will also purchase as needed if the price is low. Yesterday, it purchased 750 pieces of Indian cotton. Shenghe also bought 500 pieces of Rangoon cotton from the Huoji duantou section, which can be spun into 16-count yarn. Xinniu and Xinchuang yarn factories have already started operations and are also purchasing raw materials on the market. There are more transactions, but the amount is not huge. The source of supply from Subei is still strong, with 1,019 bales of Tonghua, 150 pieces of Beisha, 100 pieces of Niangang, and 220 pieces of Baimao arriving. There are 30 pieces for export to Shantou. The current cotton prices are listed below:</p>

<p>American Xin Te  68.00  Bought by Shenxin Factory</p>
<p>Tong Xi Rong  82.00  Bought by Peers</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market in New York opened firmer, rising by 2-3 points. It was slightly weaker midway due to small Liverpool and Bombay reports. Afterwards, it continued to rise due to strong demand from domestic factories and brisk spot transactions. However, most peers are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting Washington's decision on the cotton loan plan. Yesterday, New York rose by 5-6 points, India (including forecasts) rose slightly by 25 Qiu Bi, and Egypt rose by 25 points. Yesterday's exchange rate was uneventful. The legal tender equivalent price and transaction volume of American and Brazilian cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>500 Pieces  Spot Cash, Futures Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>00 Pieces  Spot Cash, Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>300 Bales  Transfer Payment, Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>250 Pieces  Spot Cash, Spot Goods, Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>200 Bales  Transfer Payment, Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Rose by 5 cents, Indian Cotton rose by 2 cents, Egyptian Cotton rose by over 1 yuan</p>
<p>Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet for many days. In fact, as the end of the year is approaching, factories are busy closing their books in preparation for settlement. Moreover, many goods have arrived in recent days. Next week, a certain ship will import over 7,000 pieces of American cotton, so factories are busy clearing their warehouses to receive this batch of foreign cotton. Yesterday, both Chinese and foreign factories saw quiet transactions. The foreign cotton prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Fluctuates Greatly, Yesterday Another Spiral Pattern Emerges</h3>
<p>The securities shadow market, after three days of high flying, is showing signs of weakness. The increase of three days, some are a small three yuan, some are three yuan several jiao. It seems that there is a full amount of long positions. There is not much change in the environment, but the international situation is gradually becoming explicit. The preparations for war in Hong Kong, the talks between Germany and Italy, all have the risk of causing a rupture. The hardening of the foreign exchange is not conducive to the bond market. Therefore, most people are not optimistic. Therefore, the situation in the afternoon has a looser foundation. After the future slightly relaxes, it may tend to a spiral.</p>
<p>Yesterday's process, the morning opening, is still shrouded in a strong buying atmosphere, and the trend is gradually higher again. No. 11 Tiansheng and Da Feng hao have considerable buying. In the middle, De Fu hao slightly weakens as the retail investors from the northern gang and other parties emerge. Finally, Tong Kang, Run Li, and No. 64 et al. continue to rise due to the healthy appetite, so the morning continues to rise four jiao to seven and a half jiao. The situation in the afternoon suddenly changed, and the selling party suddenly increased its advantage, indicating that there were many people taking the opportunity to sell. No. 10 even continued to sell, and No. 5 and retail investors also sold. The market atmosphere was hit by this, and it turned downstream. Although buyers such as Tong Kang Run Li and Tiansheng hao still had an appetite, they ultimately could not recover due to oversupply. However, the whole day saw more gains than losses, and the result was a continued rise of one and a half jiao to five jiao. The total transaction volume is estimated to be about 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>There were some transactions in stock trading. 50 shares of Communications Bank stock were traded at a price of 49 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. There were some transactions in Xin Xin Company stock.</p>
<p>The listed prices of London Chinese foreign bonds on the 3rd of this month (Friday) remain uneven. The British-German continued loan British-issued bonds, after falling half a pound yesterday, rebounded half a pound today, and the price is still 70 pounds. The British gold rehabilitation bond British-issued bonds continued to rise half a pound, and the price is called 17 and a half pounds. Fickes airplane bonds also rose half a pound, and the price is 13 pounds. The Hukuang Railway bonds German-issued printed bonds, after rising sharply by 2 pounds yesterday, also fell by 2 pounds today, and the price is still 20 pounds. There are no other changes. The supply and demand of physical goods in the UK are also lacking.</p>
<p>The listed prices of London British Far East companies' stocks on the 3rd of this month (Friday), only the Kailuan Mining non-registered shares fell back three pence, and the price is 16 shillings and 6 pence. There are no other changes.</p>
<h3>Grains - Passenger Xian Suddenly Rises, Inland Rough Geng Also Rises</h3>
<p>The passenger xian market initially inherited the fatigue of the previous day, and the situation was still flat. Subsequently, the price of Benjian jumped two or three jiao due to fewer arrivals. Passenger xian was favored by local street shops and retailers, and the number of transactions suddenly increased to more than 2,000 bags. The Nanjing xian, which was previously priced at 10 yuan 7 and a half jiao, also rose to 10 yuan 9 jiao. Wu xian followed suit, rising by one jiao. High-quality goods were priced at 10 yuan 5-6 jiao, and large-volume goods were priced at around 10 yuan. If sales are smoother, then the price may have to stand firm, because after the place of origin has its own export assistance, transportation is difficult to plan for a long time.</p>
<p>The source of domestic rice is decreasing day by day. It is heard that Japanese merchants in the interior continue to search for it, resulting in no arrivals at Heshang yesterday, and only over 3,000 bags of lanche baozi. 800 bags came from Neiyou Hupu. After the inland was searched for by Japanese merchants, the number of farmhouse rough geng that went on the market suddenly thinned, causing the inland mallet price to rise by a huge three jiao. Therefore, the minds of Shanghai merchants were filled with holding on. Local customers also took the opportunity to operate, and the market shape suddenly became lively. The seller's shouts gradually rose, and the result was that the holding party failed to progress, which was a deficiency in perfection. The market price of making thick geng and thin rice could only be raised by one jiao to one jiao and a half. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian also followed suit for the convenience of rice, and also showed a half jiao. The supply of Bian Yuan goods was thin, and the aroma was strong, and the price immediately rose by two jiao.</p>
<h3>American Wheat in Bulk - Mingxingchen to Arrive</h3>
<p>A large batch of American wheat, estimated at 8,300 tons, is loaded on the Yitai Company's Riley ship bound for Shanghai. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday, stating that it will be able to import at 6:30 am tomorrow (6th). This batch of wheat is handled by Dafu Foreign Company and manufacturers in the city. It is heard that there are thousands of tons of American wheat for relief, loaded on the Joff Davis ship, which will also arrive in Shanghai within a few days. The ship is represented by Weili Han Company. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Both Flour and Wheat Transactions Are Clear</h3>
<p>The flour market is gradually becoming quiet. It is found that customer gang transactions, because the opening day of the lunar new year is near, lack a large amount of digestion. However, the Nanyang gang, Shantou, Fujian, and other places have scattered embellishments every day. The Beiyang gang is filled with local foreign flour, and sales within the year are difficult to be smooth. Various factories have low output and lack wholesale supply. The total number of transactions in the unified market, in addition to the usual wholesale of 7-8,000 bags by the local street, the north and south gangs each processed nearly 10,000 bags. The No. 2 flour factory's market is still holding at 4 yuan 8 jiao. The supply and demand of San Fen is desolate, and the price is also stable. At present, the old car brand current flour retails for 4 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen in cash per bag. It is found that there are 11,500 bags exported today (5th) to Shantou, another 11,500 bags to Tianjin, and another 2,500 bags to Yantai.</p>
<p>The wheat market is already showing a remnant year scene. Arrivals are small tickets, and factory buying is also stagnant. Both parties plan to prepare for the end because the lunar new year is approaching. Therefore, there is little supply and demand, and the total transaction volume in the unified market is only 1,500 bags, which are processed by Fuxin Factory for 1,000 bags and Fufeng Factory for 500 bags. The price is 6 yuan 4 jiao to 3 jiao. This is the selling price of Zhongguan wheat, which can be described as stable.</p>
<p>Regarding the import and export of miscellaneous grains, there were 160 bags of beans shipped from Beisha yesterday. As for exports, there are 310 bags of beans and 1,000 bags of bran shipped to Shantou today, and another 500 bags of bran shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Domestic Cloth Sales in Distant Markets Still Strong, Demand for Spring Season Spot Goods Also Strong, Over 1,600 Pieces Shipped to Haiphong</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth local customer gang and domestic wholesale business have been greatly reduced due to the year-end closing. However, there is still no impact on distant markets. The Southwest, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shantou gangs have strong buying appetite, and the Yantai gang on the North Road is also purchasing vigorously. The Ningbo gang has few new processed amounts, but there are still huge amounts of booked goods to be shipped, and it is urgent to finish loading the goods as soon as possible. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs transacted over 200 boxes of Shilin cloth, blue cloth, bleached cloth, striped bleach, colored twill, printed satin, floral crepe, linen yarn, thread ne, factory cloth, etc., 50 bales of white goods fine cloth, coarse cloth, and 84 cloth. The Shantou gang and Min gang processed over 150 bales of group cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, 40-50 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. There are also scattered amounts shipped for sale in Anhui, Jiangxi, Subei, and the interior. Local Shenzhuang and wholesale zhuang have strong demand for spring sales futures and spot goods. However, the amount of goods on the market is already in the hands of holders, and peers are determined not to sell at this time, so transactions have become quiet. Yihua Factory opened for sale nearly 200 boxes of Wufu brand striped bleached cloth to peers at a price of 14 yuan per bolt. Due to the high opening price, local customers are not interested in booking. Only the Sichuan and Dian gangs, with an urgent need for goods, purchased 60 boxes. The autumn market price last year was 12 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>East Cloth yesterday each road transaction still felt lonely. White goods market plate unchanged. However, Tianjin gang and local market slightly added processing, but all limited to medium and low-end fine cloth. Fine slanting, and must be viewed as cheap. Tianjin gang entered more than 100 packages of fine cloth. Local dyeing plant entered a total of 400 packages of fine cloth and fine slanting. Longtou fine slanting still sells for 11 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen per bolt, Yanghe twill 11 yuan 5 jiao, Baby 11 yuan 3 jiao. The market atmosphere is relatively handsome.</p>
<p>Today's piece goods exports: 25 pieces to Yantai, 20 pieces to Tianjin, 410 pieces to Shantou, 65 pieces to Hong Kong, and 1,660 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<p>Qingdao black dates, according to a letter, the inventory there is not abundant, only 200 outer packages in total. The recent production price, the upper date head is 35 yuan, high unified hand 24-5 yuan, Fuhong dates have more existing number, not up to 700 packages in total, Guang gang directly processed over a hundred packages, the price is 13 yuan half, followed by 13 yuan, small red dates are out of stock.</p>
<h3>Price of Hardware Goods, Especially Eastern White Iron, Plummets Due to Overstocking</h3>
<p>The price of Eastern White Iron had previously risen due to low factory output and strong market demand, reaching record highs, such as 3.50 yuan per sheet for the 3'7" size and 3.20 yuan per sheet for the 3'6" size. Recently, however, the arrival of American white iron, coupled with increased factory output, has led to a sharp decline in sales. The imbalance between supply and demand has caused standard prices to weaken rapidly. Furthermore, large quantities of ready-made goods are being shipped from Japan for dumping in Shanghai, causing prices to fall sharply. For example, the 3'6" size now sells for 2.45 yuan per sheet, and the 3'7" size sells for 2.89 yuan per sheet, both more than half a yuan lower than before. However, actual transactions remain scarce, leading to a pessimistic outlook among those in the trade. It is reported that only two to three thousand sheets were traded throughout the city yesterday, all sold by retail outlets to individual customers, with no activity from major buyers.</p>
<h3>Coal and Coal Dust Quietly Selling Well</h3>
<p>Due to limited supply and stockpiles of high-grade coal dust, market conditions have suddenly tightened. There are surprisingly few sellers in the market, causing spot prices to rise stealthily. Yesterday, a certain company sold Kaiping special coal dust from its own warehouse at 40 yuan per ton, No. 1 coal dust at 39 yuan, and No. 2 coal dust at 38 yuan, in transactions between traders, totaling over 200 tons, delivered to customers with only a 2 yuan per ton handling fee.</p>

<h3>How We Should Read</h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>Little friends, today we're going to talk about how to read. I imagine you'll be happy to know!</p>
<p>What is reading? Simply put: it's using only your eyes to look, not your mouth to sing. In the past, people always read books aloud, reciting them loudly. But after they finished reading, if you asked them about the content of the book, they would blush and shake their heads, unable to say. This is because reading in this way is just singing with the mouth, without paying attention to the meaning. If you don't believe me, you can try it with the children in private schools. Reading like this means you can't read many books, because reading aloud is not fast; therefore, your reading skills won't improve. Most literary figures also say that they succeeded by reading books, not by rote memorization. What is the reason for this? First, it reduces the movement of the mouth, using only the eyes to look, so naturally you will see faster. Second, by eliminating reading aloud, the number of words that can be seen in the pauses of the eyes will increase. Third, using only the eyes makes it easier to understand the meaning of the book, so now everyone has switched to reading, and except for poems and other articles, reading aloud has been abandoned.</p>
<p>Reading is further divided into two types: close reading and skimming. Shorter articles with better and more difficult content should be closely read; otherwise, they can be skimmed. Close reading means that the meaning of the article must be understood clearly, good sentences must be memorized, and the writing style of the article must be studied. Skimming does not require understanding the writing style, but only knowing the general content.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the order of reading; you should have a plan for reading. What to read today, what to read tomorrow, should all be predetermined. The books you read should be selected, choosing books that interest you and are at the right level; or ask your teacher to choose them for you. When you get a book, first skim through it, understand the general idea of the book, and use a pencil to record any unfamiliar or incomprehensible words and content meanings in a notebook. After reading a paragraph or article, review it again, remember the main idea, and look up new words and difficult terms. If you have any questions, ask your classmates or teacher. Once you understand everything, record this reading note (attached later). If there are practice questions at the end of the book, answer them and ask your teacher to correct them.</p>
<p>This is what you should pay attention to: we should not switch to reading other books until we have finished reading one book. You must read with perseverance, and not be happy for a while, and then become indifferent after a considerable period of time, without any interest in reading it. Otherwise, there will be no results. When reading, you must fully understand all the words in the book, understand the content, and remember the important parts so that you can describe them orally. If there is anything you don't understand, ask your classmates or teacher, and don't have an attitude of not seeking full understanding.</p>
<p>Little friends, while your memory is still good, quickly follow my advice and read more books!</p>
<h3>Jumping Rope</h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>In cold weather, jumping rope is a great game. But jumping rope is not only a game, it is also a great exercise. When jumping rope, you exercise the muscles of the whole body and harmonize the blood vessels. At the same time, it can also make the muscles of the feet elastic; therefore, even famous athletes carry ropes with them and practice regularly. This is to make them more energetic when running or high jumping.</p>
<p>After this introduction, the value of jumping rope seems to have increased a bit, and you may not despise it so much from now on, but if you want to practice, if your posture is incorrect, it will be harmful to your body. This requires special attention. Now I will talk about this aspect in general.</p>
<p>When jumping rope, your feet should land on your toes, and your toes should be very close together. Landing on your heels is harmful to your brain. Both upper arms should swing. It is incorrect to keep both the upper and lower arms still and use only your wrists. The chest should be out, and if you are having trouble jumping, take a few deep breaths, which is very hygienic.</p>
<p>If your face turns pale and your heart beats too fast after jumping for a long time, it is because you are not in good shape or because your posture is incorrect, and you should stop at that time. Take a few deep breaths and rest. The number of jumps should be increased gradually, and as you practice more and more, you will naturally become skilled, and then, even if you jump one or two hundred times, only sweat will flow from your forehead, and your face will no longer turn pale.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge About Coal Gas</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Winter has gone! Many of the children's homes, or have already installed the stove, the whole room warm as spring coming! But children you should pay attention, winter installation of stoves, on the one hand is comfortable, on the other hand is dangerous! Children just pay attention to the newspapers every winter carrying the news of being poisoned by gas, you can know how dangerous it is to install a stove!</p>
<p>Children's homes installed stoves, it is best to use lead skin to make a chimney to lead the gas out of the house. Otherwise, the whole room is filled with terrible gas, this gas will combine with oxygen, into carbon dioxide gas. And because the oxygen in the room is limited, and people exhale is carbon gas, so the continued production of gas, there is no oxygen to combine with it, so the whole room has become another gas called "carbon monoxide"; but this gas is toxic in nature, and has the nature of solidification, after people inhale it, it is mixed in the blood in the human body, and then completely combined with the gas in the blood and solidified. Children! Blood is flowing, it loses its unique ability to move, of course, can no longer flow. As a result, people in the room unknowingly lose consciousness, children! Is not this dangerous?</p>
<p>If unfortunately a poisoning event occurs, then you can not panic, just very calm and very agile, first open the window, so that fresh air quickly flow in, and then drag the poisoned person to a place where the air flows, then perform artificial respiration, this method is very sure after people with experience perform, but remember to have patience, because it is nothing strange to perform four or five hours.</p>
<p>As for the prevention side, the above has said that it is best to install a chimney. If you feel the indoor air is too dry, you can add a pot of water or copper hanging on the stove, so that the indoor air can be humid, and the boiled water, the father can be applied at any time.</p>
<h3>Winter Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Written by Ci Kai</p>
<p>Open the window, change the air, the weather is cold, do not close the window tightly. Head exposed outside. Do not drill into the quilt.</p>
<p>At the foot of the wall, bask in the sun. My brother is holding a new book to read. My sister is threading a needle to make clothes. Dad said, "The light is too strong here for reading, and your eyesight will be damaged."</p>
<h3>Being a Little Radio Amateur (II)</h3>
<p>— Xi Ren</p>
<p>1. Wang Min and his cousin</p>
<p>His cousin glanced at him and said, "This is called a capacitor, and it is used to change stations on a radio. See, installed on the radio, just turn this handle with your hand, and the radio station will change to another one." As he spoke, his cousin gestured to Wang Min.</p>
<p>At this time, Wang Min was listening with great interest, opened his mouth, and stared at his cousin without moving his eyes, asking, "Then how is it installed in the radio?"</p>
<p>"Um." His cousin only made a sound in his nose, looking embarrassed, and said, "This... this can't be explained in a moment, but if you like, I can teach you."</p>
<p>"Then is it difficult to make a radio?" Wang Min still didn't quite believe that a radio could be made like this.</p>
<p>"Easy, easy, it's very easy, okay, let me start teaching you!" Wang Min's cousin said with certainty.</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay!" Wang Min heard that his cousin was going to teach him how to make a radio, and he was so happy that he shouted.</p>
<p>That day, at dusk, Wang Min's mother came back from a relative's house, and he rushed to say, "Mom, my brother is willing to teach me how to make a radio. Slowly I will learn to make a small one for you, which can be placed by your side, and you can listen to it even when you are walking on the road, isn't that good?" Wang Min spoke with great enthusiasm, looking very excited.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, talk about it when you make it." Wang Min's mother also looked a little disbelieving and impatiently ran to cook dinner.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the study room was dark, but the two brothers were still sitting inside talking. That night, Wang Min was very happy. He didn't even have time to eat well, so he dragged his cousin to talk. When it was very late, he still couldn't think of sleeping, and it was only when his mother reminded him that he reluctantly went to bed.</p>
<p>2. Recognizing Parts</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the two brothers got up very early. As soon as he wiped his face, Wang Min asked his cousin, "Brother, what is the first thing to learn when making a radio?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, you haven't recognized the parts used in the radio yet, have you? Let me introduce the various parts to you first!" His cousin paused and said, "The first thing we are going to make now is a crystal radio, so let me first talk about the parts used on a crystal radio." So, he picked up a piece of something with thin slices and said:</p>
<p>"This is called a capacitor (see Figure 1), but some people also call it a capacitor, in fact, they are the same thing, it's just that they are translated from foreign names differently."</p>

<h3>I Am a Poor Girl</h3>
<p>— Huang Xiujuan, 5th Grade Student, Qixiu Elementary School</p>
<p>When I was one year old, I lost my happiness. Why? Because when I was one year old, I was an orphan! At that time, my father passed away, and I relied entirely on my loving mother to raise me from just over a foot long to adulthood. Now I am fourteen years old, and I am only in the fifth grade! This can only be blamed on my bitter fate. After my father died, my mother worked very hard to maintain her life. Of course, I couldn't start reading early, so I am still in the fifth grade. Sometimes when I think of myself, being so old and still in elementary school, I am a little ashamed, and I no longer want to exist in this world. But when I think back: we are not doing it for ourselves, but for the country. If everyone thought this way, wouldn't the country be strong? Our parents raised us for the country, so we must now study hard and serve the country in the future.</p>
<h3>Time is Precious</h3>
<p>— Wu Dingkun, 2nd Grade Student, Wenchang Elementary School</p>
<p>One day, after dinner, my dad gave me a riddle to guess. He said, "You can't see it, you can't touch it, you can't buy it, you can't borrow it, what is it?" I said, "What you can't see is air, what you can't touch is electricity, what you can't buy is parents, what you can't borrow is children." Dad said, "No, I'm talking about one thing." I thought for a long time and couldn't figure it out. Later, Dad said, "This is time; because you can't see it, you can't touch it, you can't buy it, you can't borrow it, so time is precious." I didn't think it was interesting when I heard it.</p>
<p>In bed, I thought about it for a long time, and then I realized that time is really precious: because it only goes and doesn't come back. I gradually grew up from a child, and I can never go back to being a child. Today is February 2, 1939, and there will never be a second February 2, 1939. This is the phenomenon that time goes by and never returns. Time is really something that you can't buy or borrow, it is extremely precious.</p>
<p>Little friends, after I got this answer, the more I thought about it, the more right it was. I hope that all of you little friends, starting today, will cherish time and save time. Don't let it go at any time, because time is precious.</p>
<h3>After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Li Shengming, 5th Grade Student, Guangzhao Girls' Elementary School</p>
<p>The storm roared. The fine rain like silk was floating in the air.</p>
<p>After a while, the sparse rain stopped very slowly and silently.</p>
<p>When the rain stopped, I slowly paced onto the balcony. Although the surface of the balcony was concrete, it was not very flat, and there were several shallow pits that had accumulated some rainwater.</p>
<p>A gust of wind rolled up from the ground and blew onto the balcony in an instant. The rainwater in the shallow pits was also blown into ripples. The state of the ripples was very light and soft, like a thin veil being blown by the wind.</p>
<p>On the muddy ground below the balcony, the water formed islands, scattered and separated.</p>
<p>Looking up, the sky was filled with countless scale clouds, all in a grayish-blue color, as if they were slowly floating along without being in a hurry. Sometimes, through their pores, you could see the white clouds lining the inside and the blue sky hidden in the innermost layer. This kind of natural and lovely scene seemed to have washed away all the dirt in the entire space after the rain.</p>
<p>From the chimneys on the roofs of every house, wisps of smoke gradually emerged and were slowly swallowed up by the sky.</p>
<p>The houses were surrounded by green mountains, all wearing brown cloaks and covered with small hats of thin gray gauze. Their clothes and hats were decorated with messy and sparse green leaves, black branches, and rocks that had been sprinkled brown by the water. The rest was far away from me, making it difficult for me to see clearly, and I could only see their borderless shadows.</p>
<p>The sky was very quiet, and the earth had been covered by darkness. I also walked down from the balcony and returned to the room.</p>
<h3>A Dream</h3>
<p>— Xu Wuding, 6th Grade Student, Minzhi Elementary School</p>
<p>It was eleven o'clock at night! I was reading alone when suddenly an unfamiliar old man came and asked me to go to the countryside to enjoy the scenery! Unknowingly, I followed him!</p>
<p>Before long, a burst of fragrance rushed towards me! It turned out we had arrived in the countryside! The scenery in the countryside is so lovely! In addition to the fragrant and rich exotic flowers and plants, there are also vast rivers and beautiful birds, which make people feel like they are in a fairyland! I was so fascinated that I stood there blankly. Suddenly, a large snake, ten feet long and six inches thick, came in front of me! It opened its blood-red mouth as if it wanted to bite me! I was extremely afraid! I woke up with a start! I opened my eyes and saw that there was no old man! No exotic flowers and plants! No vast rivers! No small birds or big snakes! There was nothing, it was just a dream!</p>

<h3>Several Points to Note for Sleeping in Winter</h3>
<p>— Shun Ji</p>
<p>A. Don't Sleep with Your Head Covered - Sleeping with your head covered in winter because of the cold is very common among children, but it is very inappropriate. Because sleeping with your head covered has the following four disadvantages:</p>
<p>1. Because sleep is a complete rest, it allows the fatigue toxins accumulated in the muscles during the day to take the opportunity to be released and restore physical strength. If you sleep with your head covered, the air in the quilt is foul, and the blood cannot absorb fresh air, so the discharge of turbid fatigue toxins is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>2. If you get into the habit of sleeping with your head covered, if you accidentally expose your head outside the quilt, you will feel the cold air piercing your brain directly through your nostrils, which is most likely to damage your brain, or cause rhinitis and constant runny nose.</p>
<p>3. Wrinkles easily appear on the face, and cracks occur on the skin of the lips and corners of the mouth.</p>
<p>4. Difficulty in breathing, prone to sleep paralysis; it is also difficult to hear the sound of outside fires and unfortunate events, which is very dangerous.</p>
<p>B. Do Not Use a Foot Warmer - When we sleep, we often feel that the bedding is cold and like to use a foot warmer, but we don't know that the foot warmer has the following disadvantages:</p>
<p>1. Putting the foot warmer on the bed makes the air easily turbid and hinders the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>2. If you are not careful, it is easy to cause a fire.</p>
<p>3. The temperature is too high, which can easily burn the skin. If we feel cold feet, we can do one or two sections of gymnastics before going to bed to accelerate blood flow throughout the body and increase body temperature. Or wash your feet with warm water, but never develop the habit of using a foot warmer inside the quilt.</p>
<p>C. Do Not Be Greedy for Sleep - Being greedy for sleep and getting up late in winter is almost a common problem among children. You should know that sleeping late is harmful to your body, and getting up late is also harmful. If you are afraid of the severe weather, you will have to get up sooner or later, so why delay it? Moreover, as long as you develop the habit of getting up early, it will not be a problem even in the cold winter. After getting up early, on the one hand, you can breathe more fresh air and strengthen your body; on the other hand, you can increase a lot of time for practicing writing and reading, which is really killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>Arriving in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Ming Er's Refugee Diary - Part Twelve—</p>
<p>This was a day with a high autumn sky and refreshing air, the third day since Ming-er left his second home, which was also the first time he had ever been to Hangzhou. He had longed for Hangzhou for a long time, because he often heard people say: "Above is heaven, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou". What is so good about Hangzhou? Is it worthy of being called heaven on earth? He could go to Hangzhou today, and he was secretly happy in his heart, but he dared not say it.</p>
<p>The three small boats were advancing in the small river where the water and the sky met. The boatmen were also competing to be the first, but Ming-er's boat was always in the lead, and Ming-er was very grateful to the boatman. He couldn't wait to get to Hangzhou immediately. The more anxious he was, the more he felt that the small boat was sailing slower than before. Shake! Shake! It was already noon, and the sun was gradually moving westward, but the boat was still far from Hangzhou in Ming-er's eyes.</p>
<p>The boatman suddenly pointed to a large bridge in the southeast and said, "That's Hangzhou over there." Ming-er immediately followed the boatman's finger and looked over, only to see some vague black shadows lying across the river.</p>
<p>A round red sun was gradually being swallowed by the river water on the distant bank. The surrounding darkness also slowly enveloped it. A flock of crows were crowing as they returned to their nests. At this time, sparks were almost about to burst out of Ming-er's head, because he had stretched his neck and looked forward to it for a whole day.</p>
<p>The vague black shadows were a little clearer. Ming-er could see three large bridge holes, and he could also see people coming and going continuously on the shore, and he could also see dots of lights and hear a burst of noisy sounds.</p>
<p>At about seven o'clock in the afternoon, they finally arrived at the first stage of their second refugee journey - Hangzhou. Ming-er had already been on the bow of the boat, ready to jump ashore and have a good time as soon as they landed. But Ming-er's father told them to wait on the boat, so he and the two gentlemen, Zhang and Li, went ashore to make arrangements.</p>
<p>Ming-er hated the small boat to the extreme. It was small and dirty, and it made his feet cramped for three days, so he couldn't stand up for a while. Today, he had this great opportunity, but he was stopped by his father. At that time, Ming-er was angry and hated in his heart, but he dared not resist his father's orders, so he had to grit his teeth and wait! Wait! This annoying wait!</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, Ming-er's father suddenly came back, panting and saying, "We can't hire a boat tonight, we have to stay at the Guotang Inn (note). You can go ashore, the luggage has been handed over to the transportation company, and they are responsible for it." As soon as Ming-er heard the words "go ashore", he jumped up happily, but he didn't dare to jump up right away, and secretly rejoiced in his heart. They paid the boat fare and went ashore.</p>
<p>"The Guotang Inn is in Jianggan, which is very far from here. It's hard to get so many rickshaws for so many people at once. Let's go and call a bus." Ming-er's father said to the two gentlemen. So they went to a nearby teahouse and quickly called a bus.</p>
<p>As soon as Ming-er went ashore, he stretched his body, which had been cramped for three days, and felt comfortable and happy all over. He looked around at everything around him. The streets were wide and clean, the houses on both sides were tall and neat, and the people of Hangzhou were looking at them with curious eyes. Ming-er wanted to go over and take a closer look, but he was stopped by his mother. After a short time, his father returned to the teahouse and said to them, "There is no bus either, so we have to call rickshaws." So they, more than thirty people, walked out of the teahouse together. But where could they find so many rickshaws? So they called one rickshaw after another. It was not easy to call more than a dozen rickshaws. Everyone got on the rickshaws and went to the Guotang Inn in Jianggan.</p>
<p>(Note) A kind of business that specializes in serving travelers and making travel convenient. Its nature is very similar to the reception offices that travel agencies set up in various places now.</p>

<h3>Brother and Sister - Picking Apples</h3>
<p>— Written by Han Qing</p>
<p>The brother said, "Sister! Look, there are many apples on the tree opposite us. How can we find a way to pick them and eat them?" "I've got it! Let's take a big foot basin and use it as a boat." "Haha! We picked many apples." The brother and sister carried them home together.</p>
<h3>Snow White (6)</h3>
<p>— Celestial Grandson</p>
<p>This dusk, the seven dwarfs returned home, only to see wisps of white smoke suddenly rising from the chimney of their little house. The astonishment in their hearts was something no one could have imagined.</p>
<p>They watched from outside for a while, then said in unison, "Eh, strange, strange, there must be someone in our house!" So, the seven dwarfs didn't go into the house right away, but sat down at the foot of the largest pine tree and held a meeting.</p>
<p>They whispered to each other, "Maybe it's a ghost!" "Maybe it's a demon!"</p>
<p>But the old curmudgeon remained calm, without any surprised expression, and said to his companions, "There's nothing strange about this. I knew it all along! Didn't I tell you before that something terrible would happen in about two hundred years?"</p>
<p>"Shh... don't be so loud!" Doctor warned, as he often wanted to be the leader of the group, but his actions often led to nothing. Right then, he put on a brave look and directed his companions, "Hmph, comrades, be brave. Follow me! Quickly follow me!"</p>
<p>The seven dwarfs, filled with trepidation, tiptoed towards their little house. It was quiet all around, without a sound. They raised their iron hammers and proceeded step by step, with Doctor leading the way, hurrying ahead, and grasping the door handle.</p>
<p>Mute, the youngest of the seven dwarfs, still without a beard on his chin, followed timidly at the end, entering the house.</p>
<p>After entering, Doctor carefully lit a candle and shone it around. Indeed, someone had been in the house, and it looked different than before.</p>
<p>Sneezy pointed to a chair and said in a low voice, "Look! This chair was clearly covered in dust before, but now it's clean, without a speck of dust!"</p>
<p>Doctor also said in a trembling voice, "Even the floor has been swept. Look at everything, it's as clean as new!"</p>
<p>Because they were too busy, this house had not been cleaned for a long time. It had been clean once, but they couldn't remember when, because it was too long ago.</p>
<p>Sleepy, who was always drowsy and only wanted to sleep, hardly awake for a minute, his mouth crooked as if he were about to yawn, perked up and went to the ditch beside the dishwashing sink, exclaiming in surprise, "Hey! Someone stole our dishes!"</p>
<p>Happy interjected, "Don't be silly, they didn't steal them, they just went into the cupboard."</p>
<p>Bashful, who usually didn't speak much, always blushing and stroking his beard, didn't say a word. But at that moment, he discovered a pot hissing on the stove, clearly cooking something. It turned out that Snow White had prepared some soup for them in the pot before going upstairs. Bashful hurriedly scooped some soup with a copper spoon, wanting to taste it, and blurted out, "Wow, this tastes so good!"</p>
<p>The old curmudgeon snatched the copper spoon from him, angrily scolding, "Don't touch it, don't touch it, there might be poison in it."</p>
<p>Sneezy, like a small cannon loaded with ammunition, couldn't help but let out the longest and loudest sneeze.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army is Besieged on All Sides, the Situation on the Beijing-Shanghai Line is Tense, Japanese Troops in Gelong Town on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway are Attacked, the Pseudo-Police Chief is Killed, the Suzhou Railway Bridge is Blown Up, Japanese Military Police Arrest 145 Chinese People in Various Places</h3>
<p>Since the 7th anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident, guerrilla forces in various places have been unusually active, attacking Japanese troops every day. Currently, the battles near Wuxi, Suzhou, to the area between Taicang and Jiading along the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway, and the Beijing-Shanghai Line, have not ceased. The reporter has investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Merchant Vehicles Attacked in Gelong Town. In Gelong Town and Waigang, located at the border between Taicang and Jiading counties on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway, at around 10:00 AM on the 3rd, one passenger car and four cargo trucks from the Daizhi Motor Company, run by Japanese merchants, and one truck flying a German merchant's flag, were attacked by roaming troops while passing through the town. Two of the trucks were destroyed, and the Japanese guards were also captured. All the sugar, celery, etc. loaded on the vehicles were distributed to the poor people in the town.</p>
<p>Wuxi is Searched and Locked Down. Last month, plainclothes troops from the × division disguised themselves and infiltrated Wuxi city, posting slogans and distributing leaflets throughout the urban and rural areas. At the beginning of this month, Wu Wenzhong, the pseudo-"Police Chief" of Wuxi, was killed, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. Therefore, they locked all the city gates and conducted a large-scale search. Until yesterday, only a passageway was opened at the city gate, with increased Japanese and puppet military police conducting strict inspections.</p>
<p>Suzhou Railway Station Bridge Destroyed. According to Shanghai merchants who arrived from Suzhou yesterday, at 11:00 PM on February 1st, a railway bridge outside the Qimen Railway Station in Suzhou (near the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway) suddenly exploded, and the iron plate running across the east side of the bridge was destroyed. The sound shook houses at the time, and residents outside the city were awakened from their dreams. Repairs were only completed after several hours, and passenger trains were delayed. Suzhou is currently the location of the pseudo-"Provincial Government," so the Japanese and puppet troops have been dispatched for several days, causing disturbances in nearby villages.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Indiscriminately Arrests Innocent Men and Women. According to foreign sources, Nanjing reports that within twelve minutes, Japanese military police in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiashan, Hankou and other places arrested 145 Chinese people, aged around thirty to forty, one of whom was female.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Relief Association's Board of Directors: A Summary of All Income and Expenses Will Be Published First</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association held its ninth board meeting the day before yesterday afternoon. Chinese and Western directors were present, chaired by Vice Chairman Xu Jiyi, and the following resolutions were passed: The Finance Committee's suggestion that the February allowance should be calculated at $1.95 per person, according to the standard set by the Affairs Committee, and that the number of people should be calculated according to the count obtained by the supervisory committee was approved. The resolution that the $1,734 paid by the Cilian Association for the first half of January to the First Hospital should be reimbursed by the Association was approved. Because auditing takes time, and the accounts of this association need to be published urgently, the treasurer should be authorized to publish a summary of all income and expenses since the association began, and then wait for the audit to demonstrate trustworthiness. The resolution that the educational plan for refugee children at the No. 1 Reception Center on Dunxin Road, which had been drafted by Cai Renbao and Chen Heqin, should be accepted was approved. Yu Zuoting was hired as a standing committee member of the Rehabilitation Committee. Ye Guifu was added as a member of the Rehabilitation Committee and director of Group B of the Vocational Introduction Group.

<h3>Japanese Warships Illegally Tow Dutch Ships, Dutch Consulate Has Lodged a Protest, Dutch Ship Was Found in Xiamen, Its Current Destination is Unknown</h3>
<p>The Dutch ship "Ada" departed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 20th of last month, carrying diesel oil, scrap iron, etc. When the ship arrived in Wenzhou on the 12th, it was forced by a Japanese warship to fly the Japanese flag and then towed away. When the ship was in Wenzhou, there was another foreign ship on the side, one of which was also checked, but was still released. Several days after the Ada was towed away, some Chinese boatmen found it near Xiamen. The Dutch consulate has lodged a protest with the Japanese side, but there has been no result. The current whereabouts of the Ada are also unknown.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues a Circular to the Whole Country to Ban Japanese and Pseudo-Currency, Those Who Collect, Transport, or Use it Will Be Confiscated and Punished as Traitors</h3>
<p>In order to counter the Japanese attempt to disrupt our finance, and vigorously promote the conspiracy of banknotes issued by Japanese and puppet banks, and military tickets issued by the Japanese army, the Ministry of Finance has specially stipulated eight measures to ban Japanese and puppet banknotes, and ordered all military and political organs across the country to follow them. The provisions are as follows: All Japanese and puppet banknotes, regardless of where they are located, are prohibited from being accepted and used. The aforementioned Japanese and puppet banknotes refer to banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan, military tickets issued by the Japanese army, banknotes of the pseudo-United Reserve Bank, and other banknotes of the same nature issued by Japan and its puppets. Any troops or other organs in various war zones that are found to be collecting, transporting, or using Japanese and puppet banknotes for the Japanese side shall, in addition to confiscating all banknotes, send the criminals to the local or nearby military law organs to be punished in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors for helping Japan disrupt finance. The same shall apply to those who intend to profit by exchanging Japanese and puppet banknotes for legal tender, gold, silver, or remittances. Regarding the confiscation of Japanese and puppet banknotes stipulated in the preceding article, regardless of the amount, they should be immediately submitted to the local or nearby military and political chiefs for inspection, and then forwarded to the Military Commission for disposal by the Ministry of Finance. When the Ministry of Finance receives the aforementioned confiscated Japanese and puppet banknotes, it shall give bonuses according to the amount seized. All public and private organizations, military and civilian personnel, etc., inside and outside the war zones, who know of secret organizations or individuals collecting, transporting, or using Japanese and puppet banknotes shall immediately report them to the local military and police organs for arrest and investigation. After the arrest and interrogation, in addition to punishing the criminals in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, the seized Japanese and puppet banknotes shall be handled in accordance with Article 3 of these Measures. The names of the original reporters stipulated in Article 5 of these Measures shall be kept strictly confidential by the military and police organs, and reported to the Ministry of Finance for a bonus. Those who are aware of the circumstances stipulated in Article 5 of these Measures and conceal them without reporting them shall be punished as traitors after investigation by the military and police organs. Those who falsely accuse others shall be severely punished in accordance with the criminal law. These Measures shall be implemented from the date of approval.</p>
<h3>Ningbo River Cargo Import and Export Supplementary Measures Promulgated, Must Be Approved by the Chamber of Commerce, Direct Ticket Prices Restored to Original State</h3>
<p>The Headquarters of the ×th Group Army, in order to dredge the local goods of eastern Zhejiang, specially approved foreign ships to sail directly between Shanghai and Ningbo to load and transport goods. The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters established a martial law inspection office, and stipulated measures for certificates for goods entering and leaving, which must be certified by the Chamber of Commerce. The Dinghai County Chamber of Commerce, etc., requested the restoration of the Shanghai-Dinghai route to facilitate freight transportation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Promulgation of Measures for Goods Entering and Leaving Ningbo River. The Ningbo Garrison Headquarters has formulated supplementary measures for the import and export of goods in the Ningbo River. Article 1: These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Items 6 and 7 of Article 7 of the 通航办法 (Navigation Measures) promulgated by the Headquarters of the ×th Group Army on January 19. Article 2: All goods entering and leaving the Ningbo River (except for the local inland area) shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Article 3: Merchants applying to purchase goods or export local products must fill out an application form and submit it to the local chamber of commerce, which will then submit it to the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Production Adjustment Office for review. Only after obtaining a transport permit can the goods be loaded and transported. All inspection organs and troops shall release the goods upon verification of the certificate. Article 4: The County Office should take into consideration the maintenance of our country's industry and the increase of exports, while reviewing whether the goods should be allowed to be transported out. However, regarding our country's resources and articles suspected of aiding the enemy, the Zhejiang Customs has issued a ban on transport in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, and the County Office should follow this. Article 5: Sailboats transporting goods in and out should be limited to traveling to and from the local inland area. However, when importing, they should seek a proper guarantee and submit evidence of the arrival location to the verification organ for cancellation within a time limit. Imported goods are limited to local products in this area, and may not be transshipped to other ports outside this area, or loaded from other ports outside this area for import. The two counties of Yuyao and Shangyu may follow the provisions of Article 9 of the 通航办法 (Navigation Measures) for navigation with the north bank. Article 6: These measures shall be submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for record by the ×th Group Army Headquarters, and shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. Amendments will be notified separately.</p>
<p>How to Use the Goods Application Form. When local chambers of commerce accept applications for the entry and exit of goods, they should consider the types and quantities of goods listed in the merchant's application, fill in the first copy, and fill in the address of the firm in detail in the second and third copies. Then, they should submit them to the County Office for review. After the County Office reviews them, they should transfer the items filled in by the Chamber of Commerce into the first, second, third, and fourth copies, and then send the second, third, fourth, and fifth copies back to the Chamber of Commerce to be returned to the original applicant for verification of the goods. When the inspection organ verifies, if there is no other reason, it will fill in the fifth copy and issue it to the merchant who is reporting the verification, and seal the second and third copies and send them to the Staff Office of this headquarters, without the need to attach other documents. If it is imported goods, this headquarters does not need to keep it on file, and the second and third copies can be omitted. This form is suitable for use by those who have not been publicly organized. If it has been publicly organized, the form promulgated by the province should still be used. However, the County Office must issue two additional certificates and send them to the verification office along with the original certificate for processing. The verification office will forward them to the Staff Office of this headquarters, without the need to attach other documents. If it is a unique large amount of goods that needs to be transported by special ship, a document or the certificate and ship name should be reported to the headquarters for verification. This form should be printed by local chambers of commerce in the same format on white newsprint for use. No other documents are required for application. This form is free of charge, and there is no need to affix stamps. (Form omitted)</p>
<p>Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger Ticket Prices. After the Headquarters of the ×th Group Army specially approved foreign ships to sail directly between Shanghai and Ningbo in order to dredge the local goods of eastern Zhejiang, the Deping, Moufu, Yongfu, Xinxiangtai, Liangzhou, Xin'anna, and other ships were dedicated to sailing directly between Shanghai and Ningbo to load and transport local goods for export. At the same time, the Portuguese company Meda and the American company Tangsai were specially approved to sail directly between Shanghai and Ningbo, mainly for passengers. Both ships left Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday and decided to release directly to Ningbo first. Passenger tickets: Meda third class $1.50, bunk $3.00, cabin $4.00; Tangsai third class $1.50, cabin $4.00, first class cabin $6.00. These fares have been restored to pre-war standards. However, since the Zhejiang Customs ordered the prohibition of transporting tung oil, cotton, native paper, and other local goods from Zhejiang to Shanghai, the amount of local goods transported from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai has been greatly reduced, and the amount of cotton, native paper, etc. stacked in Ningbo is quite large.</p>
<p>Martial Law Inspection Office Established. The Ningbo Martial Law Inspection Office has been jointly organized by five agencies: the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters, the ×××th Division of the National Army, the Sixth District Security Headquarters, the Ningbo Police Bureau, and the Yin County Government. After being submitted to the Headquarters of the ×th Group Army for approval, it is under the command of the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters. Guo Commander has appointed Yu Yinmin as director and Ma Zhenzhong as deputy director. It was officially established on February 1st. The former Yin County City Defense Command Military and Police Joint Inspection Team was ordered to be abolished at the same time. Fu Jiannan, the deputy captain of the team, was transferred back to the Transportation Department to serve.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Fish Merchants Request the Dispatch of a Special Ship to Transport Fish to Shanghai, Ningbo Garrison Headquarters Agrees to Forward to Military Authorities for Approval</h3>
<p>Dinghai's fish production is very large every month. Since the promulgation of the new measures for navigation in the Ningbo River, all Shanghai-Wenzhou-Taiwan and Shanghai-Ningbo ships have been prohibited from docking in Dinghai. Dinghai fish merchants believe that this affects the fishing industry economy, and a special representative was sent to Ningbo to request the Garrison Headquarters to assign a special ship to travel between Dinghai and Shanghai to transport fresh fish. Now the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters has agreed to forward it to the military authorities for review and approval.</p>
<h3>French Mail Ship Delayed Departure, Parts Slightly Damaged, Rescheduled to Export This Morning</h3>
<p>The French mail ship Foelix Roussel arrived in Shanghai from Marseille on the 28th of last month and went to Kobe the next day. After returning to Shanghai from Kobe on the 3rd of this month, it berthed at the Gonghexang Wharf in Hongkou. It was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Europe on the morning of the 4th, but unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, the parts were slightly damaged, and workers were hired to repair them immediately. Therefore, it failed to set sail yesterday morning. It is heard that the repairs can be completed last night, and it is rescheduled to export at about 6:00 this morning. This ship, like the Coolidge, also delayed its departure by one day.</p>
<h3>Zhangjiagang Route Officially Resumes, German Company Establishes Schi-I-De Trading Company, Scheduled to Start Operation on the 6th</h3>
<p>The Zhangjiagang route is the hub for passengers and goods entering and leaving the counties of Cheng, Xi, and Chang after the war. Since the suspension of navigation in October last year, it has been quite inconvenient. Recently, the German company Hanwen Trading Company has been preparing to resume navigation and has already been completed. A separate company, Schi-I-De Trading Company, has been established, and an office has been set up in Zhangjiagang to specialize in passenger and freight transportation between Shanghai and the port, as well as customs declaration matters. It is scheduled to start business on the 6th. The Hanwen Trading Company's ships, Haikang and Lu'an, are also scheduled to start sailing officially on the 6th. Before, although the Haikang and Lu'an ships had been sailing on the Zhangjiagang route without interruption, they only went to Yangjiatan and Lanmensha to the west of Zhangjiagang. In the future, it should be much more convenient. The foreign merchant ships that previously sailed to the port, such as Ruihe, Huangpu, and Xiangtai, are also preparing to resume navigation. If the navigation is safe and the business is not hindered by other factors, it can be resumed soon.</p>
<h3>Foreigners in Guling Will Reply to the Japanese Side, Japanese Army Promises to Transport Them to Jiujiang Only, Only Protection, Not Guarantee, of Houses</h3>
<p>The 大陆报 (Continental Daily) reported that, according to news from the Jiujiang Tongmeng News Agency, the 65 foreigners residing in Guling will reply to the Japanese demand that they withdraw before February 10. This reply will be handed over to the Japanese side before that day. According to a spokesman on Thursday (2nd), the Japanese naval authorities intend to transport these foreigners to Jiujiang only. The Japanese military commander has stated that he will do his best to protect the foreign property in the famous mountain resort, but will not guarantee it, even if the Chinese army in the area resides in buildings owned by foreigners. There are 37 British, 12 American, 9 German, and several others in Guling. The Japanese side demanded at the beginning of this week that they all withdraw before February 10.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Searches and Robs Civilian Ships in Hupukou, Kills Two Fur Traders, Looting Valuables Worth 7-8 Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>According to people from Changshu, Hupukou along the Yangtze River is a prosperous commercial area after the war, with many merchants gathering and congested freight transport. In order to covet the tax revenue of the port, the Japanese side specially transferred dozens of marine corps to jointly handle tax revenue and inspect passengers with the pseudo-organization. The day before yesterday (2nd), a merchant selling yellow wolf skins was shot and killed by the Japanese army for no reason and thrown into the river, causing panic among the merchants. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 3rd, four civilian ships anchored along the port were checked by the Japanese army under the pretext of inspection, and all the banknotes, silver dollars, gold ornaments, watches, etc. carried by the passengers were looted and removed. The total loss suffered reached a huge amount of 7-8 thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Arrest Japanese Ship Repair Foreman, Infiltrates the Laogongmao Shipyard, the Japanese Garrison Unaware</h3>
<p>The Pudong Bailianjing Chinese merchant Laogongmao Shipyard was seized by the Japanese after the war and renamed the Ping'an Shipyard. Forced recruitment and factory opening were carried out, managed by the Japanese Navy, specializing in repairing speedboats destroyed by the Chinese army. There were 700-800 long-term and short-term workers. Due to the increasing number of destroyed speedboats, the work was extremely busy. Unexpectedly, the Pudong guerrillas suddenly sent four commando members yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, each with a pistol and hand grenade, infiltrated the factory, and arrested a local man named Chen Fugui, the foreman of the subcontractor. The reason for the arrest was that he was willing to serve the enemy. The guerrillas acted secretly, and the dozen or so Japanese troops stationed in the factory were not aware of it. It was not until Chen was arrested and taken away that they began to search for him, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>Trade Commission Ordered to Purchase Local Products in Eastern Zhejiang, Has Ordered Zhejiang Office to Comply, Loaded on British Swire Ships and Concentrated in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>After the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the transport of 54 kinds of local products, such as northern cotton, native paper, and tung oil, to Shanghai, the Ningbo and other chambers of commerce and trade associations in eastern Zhejiang sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the transport to Shanghai to help farmers and merchants. Now the Trade Commission has been ordered by the Ministry to instruct the Zhejiang Office of the association to purchase as much tung oil, tea, and other local products from eastern Zhejiang as possible. They will be loaded onto British Swire company ships and transported from Wenzhou and Ningbo to Hong Kong, where they will be concentrated and then exported to replenish our country's foreign exchange fund. The Fuhua Company and the Central Trust Bureau are now in contact with various industries to handle all the procedures for purchasing the goods.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Advocate Frugality in Spring Banquets, Presented to the Government to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>At this extraordinary time when all sectors of the city are striving for national survival, in addition to supporting the government's resistance to the end, and enthusiastically advocating movements such as donating gold and repaying debts with one dollar, the Lunar New Year is approaching. Traditionally, all sectors have spring banquets, but the soldiers on the front line are fighting bloody battles to defend the country, and all the people of the country should share the difficulties. It is decided to abide by the government's principle of advocating frugality and implement a New Year's banquet frugality movement. The money saved will be presented to the government or used to relieve refugees. It is hoped that all sectors will actively participate to fulfill the duty of citizens.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Police Department Establishes Missing Persons Section to Investigate Abductions and Disappearances; 25 People Found Soon After Establishment</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily Mail," since the outbreak of war, the population of the two concessions has increased, and lawless elements have poured into the Public Concession, resulting in a shockingly high number of missing residents. Therefore, the Police Department formally established the Missing Persons Section on January 13th. This initiative has two main objectives: to crack down on gangs that abduct naive young men and women, and to investigate missing persons. The head of the section is Deputy Police Superintendent Fantaier, and a</p>
<p>Headquarters Established in the Old Zha Police Station. Major cities around the world have such departments, but it is still a pioneering effort in Shanghai, the world's [unclear character] largest city. The section has proven its value shortly after its establishment. From its establishment to the end of last month, a period of eighteen days, it has handled sixty-five missing person cases, and twenty-five of the sixty-five missing persons have been found.</p>
<p>Missing Person Cases Most Frequent in the New Zha District, with seventeen missing and eleven found. Next is the Old Zha District, with fourteen missing and six found. The remainder are West Hongkou, with ten missing and one found; Gordon Road District, with six missing and two found; Central District, with five missing and four found; Pudu Road District, with four missing and none found; Chengdu Road District, with three missing and one found; Jing'an Temple District, with three missing; and Yulin Road District, with two missing.</p>
<p>Yangshupu District One person missing. None of the above three districts had any success. Before the establishment of this section, anyone who went missing would first report to the nearest police station, which would then inform all police stations, police chiefs, and the French Concession Police Department through the Central Management Office, and a record would be made for reference. Since the establishment of this section, all missing person cases, after the usual report, are directly handled by the section. In other words, it is a</p>
<p>Separate Department Within the Police Organization that Cooperates with Various Police Stations to Handle Missing Person Cases. According to Deputy Police Superintendent Fantaier, the section only handles missing person cases involving individuals under the age of twenty-one. Given the current situation, they believe that those who deliberately hide cannot be investigated, and most adult missing persons are deliberately avoiding contact. Therefore, the main task of the section is to protect underage youths, regardless of whether they are single or married.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization, Flattering Japan, Plans to Form "Self-Defense Corps" in Various Districts; Chen Zemin Convenes "Administrative Conference of Various Counties" to Discuss Conscription and Military Training</h3>
<p>The puppet "Reformed Government," due to the recent extraordinary activity of guerrilla forces in various guerrilla areas, which has left the Japanese army struggling to cope, intends to establish rural self-defense corps in various districts, based on the district, to curry favor with the Japanese. Each district will forcibly conscript 160 able-bodied men, aged 18 to 25, to be trained and then sent to the front lines for combat or to deal with guerrilla forces in various locations. Chen Zemin, the puppet "Governor of Jiangsu Province," has scheduled an "Administrative Conference of Various Counties" to be held in Suzhou from the 10th to the 15th of this month to discuss this matter. However, most people in various regions deeply understand the greater good and are unwilling to be exploited. Even if forcibly conscripted, they may defect at any time. Therefore, this move by the Japanese puppets will only result in wasted effort.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council 1938 Prison Report</h3>
<p>The health of all staff members of the Bureau's prison is generally satisfactory. The Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was unable to assign personnel to guard the prison due to the important duties of its members.</p>
<p>On January 1st of last year, there were 5,199 Chinese prisoners in the prison. The number gradually increased thereafter, reaching 6,445 on September 27th and 6,312 on December 31st. Last year, fifteen prisoners were transferred from the Bureau's prison to the Second Special District Local Court Prison in the French Concession. The crimes of these prisoners occurred within the jurisdiction of the Customs Water Police Station. On June 24, 1932, the National Government promulgated an amnesty law. Twenty-seven prisoners were released last year in accordance with this law, bringing the total number of prisoners released to 3,005, including 1,181 military personnel who were arrested and subsequently punished. The parole regulations continued to be implemented. 794 prisoners were reviewed by the prison authorities and deemed eligible for parole, but only seven of them were actually paroled. The remaining prisoners were unable to find guarantors. The prison authorities, recognizing that these prisoners were unable to find guarantors due to the current circumstances, submitted a request to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to allow parole in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, but to release all prisoners who could not find guarantors after obtaining court approval. This special release measure was implemented from January 1st to June 23rd. As a result, 310 prisoners were released. There are currently 542 prisoners released under the parole regulations (excluding those granted special release). The National Government also promulgated temporary measures for prisoners to serve their sentences outside of prison on bail on December 19, 1936, and its effective period was extended to December 31st of last year. A total of 264 prisoners were reviewed in accordance with these measures, of whom 159 were proposed for release, but only 38 were actually released, bringing the total number of prisoners released on bail to 116, including those from the previous year. A total of 327 prisoners died in prison, of whom 83 had contracted fatal illnesses before entering prison. There were two suicides. The overall mortality rate was 39.96 per thousand. Only one prisoner was released due to illness. The reason for this low number of prisoners is that the Sacred Heart Hospital, Minhang Mental Hospital, and Dachang Leprosy Hospital were not open.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Reformatory reopened on January 26th of last year. On that day, eleven inmates were admitted, increasing to 127 by December 24th. Educational and vocational training continued to be implemented with satisfactory results. The facilities within the reformatory have been further improved. The lives of the juvenile inmates are similar to school life, so that their conduct is easily improved, and they will be more likely to find employment after their release. The library has been expanded and many new literary books have been added.</p>
<p>On December 31st of last year, the Western prisoner section had 123 inmates, including two who were released on bail and three juvenile inmates from the reformatory who had their sentences waived and were released after completing their rehabilitation period.</p>
<p>The work of all prisoners continued as usual. The prison staff consists of 75 Westerners, 252 Chinese, and 193 Indians.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps Annual Inspection Drill to be Held on April 16th</h3>
<p>The annual inspection drill of the Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps is scheduled to be held on April 16th (Sunday) at 2:00 PM. The Chairman of the Municipal Council will serve as the inspecting officer, and several commanders of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai will be invited to attend the inspection.</p>
<h3>British Army Seaforth Highlanders Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling One Hundred and Fifty Men</p>
<p>According to the "China Press," one hundred and fifty selected soldiers from the British Army Seaforth Highlanders, led by a drum and pipe band, marched through the city and entered the racecourse yesterday morning (the 3rd), to replace the British Army selected soldiers who recently left Shanghai for England. It is reported that these 150 British soldiers arrived in Hong Kong several weeks ago aboard the British transport ship "Talewa," and then came to Shanghai on the "Mingsheng" ship. They docked on the Bund of the French Concession early yesterday morning. Several weeks ago, 200 soldiers from the British East Surrey Regiment arrived here. Therefore, the strength of the two battalions of the British garrison in Shanghai is now sufficient.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Industry Expert, Mr. Sun Junli, to Return to China; Obtains Doctorate for Invention of Wrinkle-Free Method</h3>
<p>Sun Junli, a Chinese national, has been studying the artificial silk industry in Germany for many years. He has interned in major factories one after another, and recently specialized in the processing of artificial silk and general textiles, such as "bleaching," "sizing," "degumming," "softening," "wrinkle-free," and "waterproof," at the National Textile Industry Research Institute in Mönchengladbach (the "Manchester" on the Rhine), a textile industry center in western Germany. He invented a wrinkle-free method that is simpler and more effective than existing conventional methods, which is applicable to artificial silk, cotton cloth, and ramie cloth, etc.. The Aachen University of Technology granted him permission to recognize his research work as a doctoral dissertation. Last summer, Sun also went to various weaving and dyeing factories in southern Germany to investigate, paying attention to factory facilities and management, in addition to various engineering issues. He then interned at the main factory of the German Dye Company, specializing in special dyeing and various processing projects. He also spent a considerable amount of time at the Mönchengladbach Textile Testing Bureau, specializing in the testing of various textiles. Based on his extensive experience, he has drafted three books, "Artificial Silk Factory Design," "General Research on Artificial Silk Engineering," and "Textile Testing." It is now learned that Mr. Sun will soon return to China, and it is expected that he will make significant contributions to the domestic textile industry. Those who wish to contact Mr. Sun can write to Mr. Ju Huili, No. 4, Lane 4, Shunqing Lane, Tiantong Road, North Shanxi Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Dagukou Ice Navigation Measures</h3>
<p>Must Prepare Sufficient Fuel and Food Beforehand</p>
<p>Tianjin Dagukou has now issued various navigation measures for the ice period, which is currently in winter. All ships sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin must prepare sufficient coal, food, vegetables, and other food supplies to avoid being blocked by ice in the port, which could lead to a shortage of coal and food. At the same time, when each ship arrives at Dagukou, it must be guided into the port by an icebreaker to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Central Government Orders Rectification of Discipline to Revitalize the Spirit of Resistance; Absolutely Prohibits Gambling, Dancing, and Prostitution; How to Fulfill One's Duties to Repay the Party and the Nation</h3>
<p>The Central Executive Committee issued an order stating that, "Given the current state of national crisis, with countless matters awaiting resolution, this is a time for hardship and determination, not for ease and comfort. All our party affairs colleagues should be diligent, cautious, and strive to fulfill their duties to repay the party and the nation. However, in recent times, staff members of party departments at all levels still indulge in banquets and arbitrary entertainment. Few truly endure hardship and struggle to relieve the national crisis. If this continues, how can we establish a career and set an example? In order to rectify discipline, reverse the trend, and revitalize the spirit of resistance and national reconstruction, all staff members of party departments at all levels must absolutely prohibit gambling, dancing, prostitution, and other improper entertainment. If any of the above occurs, once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed, without leniency."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council 1938 Fire Brigade Report</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of 1,056 fire alarms and special alarms last year, an increase of 150 over the previous year. This number set a new record since the establishment of the fire brigade. The property lost due to fires (including those occurring within the Public Concession and on roads outside the Concession managed by the Municipal Council) is estimated to be worth over two million six thousand yuan. Although the losses in the previous year were greater than those in the past year, they cannot be compared because of the intense fighting at the time. Compared with previous years, this loss can be described as significant. Several major fires occurred in the Yangshupu District, and firefighters had difficulty providing assistance due to traffic inconveniences, which was one of the reasons for the significant damage.</p>
<p>Thirty-two civilians died in fires, and eighteen died due to special incidents. In addition, one person died from burns. All the unfortunate civilians who died, except for one person who was burned, had already lost their lives before the fire trucks arrived at the scene, and cannot be blamed on the fire brigade. Three hundred and twenty-three civilians and sixty-five firefighters were injured in fire alarms and special alarms.</p>
<p>The total length of hose used throughout the year was over seventy-eight miles, and the amount of water used for firefighting was over twenty million gallons, an increase of eight times compared to 1936.</p>
<p>The fire brigade received a total of 107 special alarms, of which 47 were caused by the collapse of buildings and walls. The ambulances of the first aid and hospital teams were dispatched 15,619 times, not including the number of times patients were transported from the Country Hospital. The number of dispatches due to accidents or emergencies increased by one-third compared to the previous year. The number of dispatches by the hospital team's ambulances more than doubled compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The Central Fire Brigade has established a general management office to receive all alarms regarding fire rescues, ambulance calls, and other emergency incidents. The management office is separate from the normal administrative section of the fire brigade, and therefore the efficiency of the office has greatly improved.</p>
<p>The state of the eastern district of the Concession has not yet recovered, so the Wayside and Zhoujiazui fire stations, which were destroyed during the war in the previous year, have not been re-established. The fire brigade's workshop continues to save the Municipal Council a large amount of expenditure. The workshop manufactures and installs bodies and converts old cars into new ones. Most of the equipment used by the fire brigade is also manufactured by the workshop. All fire trucks, ambulances, ordinary vehicles, and all equipment are maintained at the highest efficiency.</p>
<p>The public hydrants on the roads are regularly checked and tested. Several old-fashioned hydrants have been removed and replaced with new ones. These changes greatly facilitate firefighting work.</p>
<p>A total of 6,762 inspections of various types of buildings in the Concession were conducted to determine whether the fire prevention equipment contained therein was in compliance with regulations. New construction in the second half of the year increased significantly compared to the first half of the year. Most of the new buildings are temporary factories, so the fire brigade must inspect them regularly to determine whether there is adequate fire prevention equipment and a sufficient water supply. If any concerns are discovered, they are immediately ordered to be improved. After the increase in residents in the western district, the fire brigade received many reports, some claiming that there was a risk of fire in a certain place, or that an exit was blocked, creating a danger. The fire brigade investigated each report one by one. If it was found to be true, appropriate measures were taken to remedy the situation and avoid endangering life and property. The refugee problem has increased the workload of the fire brigade's inspectors. The fire brigade considered two shelters to be of concern, so it has sent personnel to carry fire-fighting equipment and station themselves there permanently to guard against unforeseen circumstances. All places licensed by the Municipal Council are inspected regularly, with particular attention paid to entertainment venues. Each licensee is separately ordered to pay attention to the license regulations. If any dangerous items are found, they are ordered to be moved to a safe place to prevent a fire from spreading to neighboring areas. The fire hoses installed in various buildings in the Concession have been tested more than 100 times. If any defects are found, the fire brigade immediately notifies the owner.</p>
<p>A total of 1,575 buildings in the Concession are equipped with fire alarm equipment. Twelve new fire alarm equipment installations were completed last year, have been tested, and are in use. Five original equipment installations were expanded. One hundred new equipment installations were only partially completed by the end of last year.</p>
<p>Traffic in the Concession is still very congested, especially during peak hours in the central district. Fortunately, the police officers still provide as much assistance as possible. Most drivers of various vehicles are able to give way, so there are few cases of fire trucks or ambulances being blocked on their way to the scene.</p>
<p>Cases suspected of being arson are rare. All cases lack sufficient evidence and cannot be prosecuted for arson.</p>
<p>The volunteer reserve team is being reorganized to form a single unit. The regular reserve personnel will be merged with the special ambulance transport team established during the war. The basic duty of each team member is firefighting, but most have been trained in first aid and ambulance care.</p>
<p>The fire brigade's ambulance team has been dispatched on 19 occasions. In addition to demonstrating its efficiency in responding to leaks of several refrigeration and other gases, electrical accidents, and similar alarms, the team's service has proven to be of great benefit in responding to fire alarms where smoke and other gases are prevalent and require the use of oxygen respirators. The relief team responded to 48 fire alarms. The team's personnel specialize in covering and other rescue work, so the use of special relief equipment has greatly reduced property losses.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Bureau's fire brigade and the neighboring fire brigades remains very friendly, which is gratifying. (End)</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Attempt to Use Yen in Hongkou; Last Time Rejected by the Residents' Association; Unexpectedly Seeking to Revive the Issue</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reported today (the 4th) that, according to the Japanese "Continental New Newspaper," if the plan proposed by Amano (transliteration), the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, is passed by the association's meeting, the Yen will become the "legal tender" in Hongkou after April. According to Amano, the adoption of the Yen in the area north of the Suzhou River is an "indispensable factor for Shanghai's revival and prosperity." At a meeting of the association in March of last year, a "Yen Proposal" was put forward, but it was rejected by the opposition, most of whom were mill owners who thought the move was premature. Mr. Amano believes that, judging from the current situation, this resolution will be supported by the mill owners, because the situation has changed drastically in the past year. Mr. Amano feels that the time to take this action is ripe, and he expects that his proposal will be passed, so he has ordered the association's staff to compile the budget for the next fiscal year using the Yen as the standard. The association's staff also hopes that the proposal will be passed, because if their salaries are paid in Yen in accordance with the new currency regulations, their income will increase by about one-tenth. The newspaper concluded by saying that more than 10 million Yen were circulating in Hongkou last year, and that this number is expected to increase greatly after the proposal is passed.</p>
<h3>Firearms Found on the Ruihe Steamer; Passengers Smuggling and Selling; Customs Officials Sent to Search</h3>
<p>The Ruihe steamer of Jardine Matheson, which now operates on the Yangtze River line, loaded cargo in Nantong on Thursday evening (the 2nd) and came to Shanghai, docking at Wharf No. 14 on the Huangpu Bund opposite Pudong (another report said it docked at Huacheng Wharf). Suddenly, on the morning of the 3rd, customs officers boarded the ship for a search. A Mauser rifle and a quantity of ammunition were found on board. It is said that the firearms were smuggled on board by passengers. It is reported that the reason for the customs officers boarding the ship for a search was that the Japanese side had received information.</p>

<h3>Shanghai International Relief Committee Annual Report Published; Rich in Content and Vast in Scope; Detailed Disclosure of Receipts and Expenditures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee's annual report has now been published. It is rich in content and vast in scope, breaking the record of the committee's previous "Six-Month Work Report." It is a monumental work of refugee relief literature. Mr. Baoxuewen, the Consul General of the Netherlands in Shanghai and Chairman of the Committee, stated in his preface, "This annual report is not only a work report, but also a valuable reference book thanks to the rich and innovative materials and design of the editors, It is not inappropriate to regard it as a reference for relief work." The annual report has a total of 300 pages and 100,000 words, divided into four sections: Chinese reports account for 104 pages, English reports 94 pages, statistics 56 pages, and photography 24 pages. The Chinese and English sections each contain individual reports from the General Affairs, Relief, Elbow Affairs, Education, Craft, Personnel, Medical, and Design groups. The Finance Group provides detailed disclosure of both donation income and expenditures. The figures published therein are sufficient to satisfy those who are actively supporting the committee's appropriate use of funds. Taking the food supply for the refugees as an example, the statistics show that the monthly food cost for each refugee is 2.41 yuan, clothing is only 0.46 yuan, accommodation is 0.3 yuan, and education and medical expenses are 0.47 yuan. The economy of its management can be seen from this. Although this annual report is published exclusively for the committee's supporters and its member organizations, if those from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about refugee relief, libraries, and social science experts need to read it, please come or write to the General Affairs Office of the International Relief Committee on the third floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge to obtain it.</p>
<h3>Nephew Instigates Thugs to Extort Money from Uncle's Home, Tying Up Family Members and Cutting Phone Lines; Defendant's Evasive Testimony Continued Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Chen Zhiguang, the owner of Ri Xin Sheng Foreign Goods and Cotton Cloth Store at No. 166 Old North Gate Street on Fa Da Road and a native of Ganpu, Zhejiang, residing at No. 27 Siming Lane, Lyuban Road, Avenue Joffre, had his nephew, Lu Keyi (also known as Lu Mingde, 24 years old, from Jiaxing), instigate Kong Ruian from Tianjin, Zhu Zirong from Haiyan, Xu Liangwen, and others to come to his home on the afternoon of the 25th of last month at 2 PM, using forceful and coercive means</p>
<p>to demand money. Upon reporting the incident, the French Concession Police Department immediately dispatched both Chinese and Western detectives to the scene, arresting Kong, Zhu, and Xu, along with suspect Zhou Jinzhang (28 years old, from Fengtian, manager of the Tianjin Gang Renyihe Seafood Shen Zhuang within the Ji Ru Lane, Jixiang Street, Beimaoheng Customs Brokerage), and subsequently apprehended Lu Keyi. They were all handed over to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation. The court ordered a further investigation and hearing. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judge Liao of the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Bureau, stated that the Police Department</p>
<p>found no connection with suspect Zhou Jinzhang and would not prosecute him. The first defendant, Kong Ruian, had previously worked in the Public Security Bureau and, using a stolen handgun, was instigated by the fifth defendant, Lu Keyi, to accompany the third and fourth defendants to the victim's home. Using force, they tied up the victim's family members, cut the phone lines, and threatened to extort 1,000 yuan. He requested the court to prosecute the defendants in accordance with Article 330 of the Criminal Code and to handle the case according to the law. Chen Li, the wife of the victim Chen Zhiguang, testified that Lu Keyi</p>
<p>was indeed her nephew. He used to be a cotton cloth merchant but is now unemployed. Two months ago, he borrowed 450 yuan. Before that he borrowed 20 yuan, 30 yuan, numerous times. Recently, he borrowed another 50 yuan, saying he needed to return to his hometown and asked her to buy him a train ticket and send him to the station. She didn't know why he didn't leave. On that day, four people came, but her nephew wasn't among them. The first defendant pointed a gun at her and said he was from the guerilla force, demanding she hand over money, etc. The victim's maid, Wang Sun, stated that they knocked on the door,</p>
<p>and she opened it. After they came in, she went upstairs to call Grandma</p>
<p>(referring to Chen Li) to come downstairs. Upstairs, she saw them holding guns and grabbing Grandma. She immediately went to the third-floor balcony and called for a watchman and reported to the police department. During the police interrogation, defendant Kong Ruian, who previously worked in the Public Security Bureau and as Patrolman No. 805 in the French Concession Police Department, stated that he was dismissed for misconduct. He found the handgun on the Bund when he worked at the Public Security Bureau. Last month, he met a young master (referring to Lu Keyi) at the Dafang Hotel, who asked him to</p>
<p>help him out. Therefore, he accompanied Zhu and Xu to No. 27 Siming Lane. He did not see Mr. Chen but only met Mrs. Chen (referring to Chen Li). She offered him a cigarette. Then he went out, and less than an hour later, detectives came to arrest them. Lu Keyi confessed that he used to be in the foreign goods business and had borrowed money from his aunt. Recently, his aunt and uncle refused to lend him money, so he asked Kong, Zhu, and Xu to vouch for him because he owed them money and intended to borrow more. Zhu Zirong testified that he was in the cotton cloth business and that Lu owed him 50 yuan. He accompanied Kong to vouch for Lu's debt to Mr. Chen and had no involvement in tying up Chen's family. Xu Liangwen testified that Lu was</p>
<p>gambling with hooligans and lost over 100 yuan. He asked him to pay back, but Lu didn't. He wanted to hit him, so Lu borrowed money from him to pay off the debt. Zhou Jinzhang testified that Lu Keyi bought 20 yuan worth of mushrooms from him on credit, saying they were for his maternal uncle, and asked him to collect the money from his maternal uncle. He went to No. 27 Siming Lane that day to collect the money and was mistakenly arrested as soon as he walked in, etc. The court verified the testimonies and ordered a further hearing on the 14th, as the case still required investigation. Kong, Zhu, Xu, and Lu, the four defendants, were remanded in custody. Zhou Jinzhang, having not been prosecuted, was to be released.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Bar Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association hereby notifies all members: Regarding the execution of duties by lawyers, it is necessary to have a fixed office to handle court deliveries and association notices. Therefore, lawyers should report the location of their office when joining the association and should also report any subsequent changes to the association in a timely manner to facilitate the execution of legal affairs. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, many members' offices have changed. Although the association has been diligently investigating and registering these changes, there are still members without communication addresses. The reasons for this may be that the individual has left Shanghai or has moved without reporting, resulting in the inability to communicate. This is inconvenient for both the association and the courts. For the sake of rectifying this situation, this notice is hereby issued. All members are required to report their office address, telephone number, and residential address in detail by the end of February of this year for registration purposes. Members for whom no office or residential address can be found after the deadline will be deemed not to be performing their duties, and their membership will be reported to the association for withdrawal in accordance with Article 9, Clause 9 of the Standard Rules of the Bar Association. All members are requested to take note.</p>

Therefore, after a month of day and night renovations to the original storefront, all the valuable medicines that were sold in the past have been transported in and arranged.

<h3>Unrequited Love</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>Love between the sexes should be built on mutual relationships. Only mutual attraction can lead to mutual love. And only when mutual attraction arises can mutual love be born. Otherwise, no matter how hard you chase, you cannot escape the tragic fate of failure, earning the mocking label of "unrequited love."</p>
<p>The taste of longing is the bitterest, and the situation of unrequited love is even more awkward. The death of Jia Rui in "Dream of the Red Chamber" at the hands of Wang Xifeng is the most tragic ending for a friend of unrequited love. Some say: Wang Xifeng's teasing of Jia Rui, the means are too vicious. This statement is seemingly correct but actually incorrect. They only saw Wang Xifeng's poisonous setting of the love trap, and neglected that Jia Rui's idea of "a toad wanting to eat swan meat" and behavior were the factors that led to his death.</p>
<p>Friends of unrequited love are blinded by lust, and their rationality is obliterated. They forget objective facts and subjective conditions completely, and even if they don't get a response from the other party, they still "talk to themselves" and are self-satisfied.</p>
<p>Stories of unrequited love are not only heard between the sexes from time to time; but now there are also unrequited love events being staged in international conspiracies. For example: our "friendly nation" to the east had the idea of using Wu Peifu a year ago. Recently, it has become even more lively and looks like it is a serious matter. Who knew, according to the Associated Press news: the claim that Wu Peifu has actively participated in the so-called "peace" movement is actually one side's wishful thinking. (See Second Japanese Newspaper)</p>
<p>In fact, Wu Peifu's participation or non-participation in the so-called "peace" movement has no major impact on the future of China's resistance. The reason is: Wu Peifu can still be regarded as an idol by some Chinese compatriots today because he has an indomitable spirit; if he forgets his hatred of the enemy, then the conditions for being worshiped will disappear, and the effect that the "friendly nation" to the east wants to achieve will not occur. But General Wu Peifu, who is unyielding to power, uncorrupted by wealth, and compares himself to Yue Wu Mu, how could he ruin his reputation in his later years and fall into the trap of the "friendly nation" to the east and become a puppet? Regarding this point, the "friendly nation" to the east knows it very well, but helplessly, under the painful situation of military failure, international isolation, domestic complaints, and repeated failures of its political conspiracy in China, it came up with this last resort. Who knew it would fail again, and it is still unrequited love.</p>
<p>The evolution of unrequited love will lead to the success of "flower-craziness." Flower-craziness can be divided into civil and military: civil flower-craziness is foolish and ignorant; military flower-craziness is crazy and reckless. As a result, it will either be a waste or lead to death. I heard that the "friendly nation" to the east, because it failed to seduce Wu Peifu, wants to change its method and use hard means, then the friend of unrequited love will succeed in military flower-craziness. Alas!</p>
<h3>A Shanghainese Sunday</h3>
<p>— Li Tingkang</p>
<p>On weekdays, Nanjing Road appears to be bustling with traffic around eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Every public bus or tram heading east is packed with people. Clerks of all sizes are rushing to their offices at this time. However, Sunday mornings are a bit different. Every carriage is very empty, and even the newsboys waiting at the station to sell morning newspapers don't shout very energetically, because Sunday is generally recognized as a day of rest. The hard work of the week is hoped to be rewarded with adjustment on this day.</p>
<p>However, rest in the meaning of Shanghainese is also "having fun." When leaving the office on Saturday, colleagues will ask: "Where are you going to have fun tomorrow?" It can be seen that Sunday has become a day for "having fun," and various Shanghainese have various places to have fun.</p>
<p>First, I want to say that it is not in the "fun" aspect: just looking at the many yellow churches with spire roofs in Shanghai, you can know the potential of Christianity in Shanghai. These churches are extremely active places on Sundays. Those pious men and women, regardless of major events, must go to church to pray devoutly and listen to the pastor's preaching before they can rest assured, because this ritual may include six days of repentance and remorse.</p>
<p>The U.S. Fourth Naval Unit in Shanghai also holds prayer services every Sunday morning at 10 o'clock at the Grand Shanghai Theater. The attendance is extremely crowded, including upper-class Chinese, students, middle-class merchants, etc. This is because the Naval Unit has an hour of singing and entertainment after the prayer, and the entertainment is really good. Such free enjoyment is enough to make even those who don't believe in religion willing to sit there for two hours.</p>
<p>Shanghai has fifty cinemas and six Peking opera houses. There is no one that is not packed on Sundays. These customers include gentlemen, students, and small citizens; the racetracks and dog racing tracks are full of people. Many people are intoxicated here, and winning a few double wins is more comfortable than going to the office every day; inviting a few friends to a teahouse for a chat, from the world situation of Chamberlain catching a cold in Rome to the disappearance of the Wang family's kitten next door, while chewing on all kinds of snacks they like, is naturally also a happy thing; if it is a good weather, then many people will carry a camera box to the park, although the price of film is soaring, and the park has become a shelter for upper-class refugees, but the park after all has trees, woods, and grass.</p>
<p>Cultural Street has been sadly depressed, but even on this day, some people still like to come and browse at their leisure. The same browsing work is done by some wives and children, but the location is in several famous department stores. They greedily look from here to there, and from there to here, wishing they could take all their beloved things back, but the paper bags in their hands can no longer hold any more.</p>
<p>Dance halls and restaurants are always so crowded on this day that it seems they don't want customers to patronize, but customers seem to come in droves, the more crowded the better, and lunch dances start before twelve o'clock, and even if Huadiao wine is one yuan a catty, there are still people drinking it.</p>
<p>Some people are entertaining themselves, and some are intoxicated. The whole Sunday plays out in various rhythms. The meaning of "having fun" is indeed very widely recognized, but there are also people who seem to disagree. I saw two at a glance: Wang Jinbiao, the doorman next door, is still sitting dullly on the long bench next to the door. Sunday is unmoved by him; the young man in the single-room grocery store across the street is still staring blankly at the pedestrians and vehicles on the road...</p>
<h3>A Record of the "Exhibition of Small Cold-Season Paintings and Calligraphy"</h3>
<p>— Feima</p>
<p>The Dasing Company on Nanjing Road has had three "exhibitions" in the past month: the first was Mr. Liu Haisu, the "artistic rebel"'s "solo exhibition"; the second was the "Relief of Refugees Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition" by teachers and students of the Shanghai Fine Arts School; the third is this one, the "Exhibition of Small Cold-Season Paintings and Calligraphy", the first of its kind to be held in Shanghai. The exhibition dates are the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month.</p>
<p>Of the above three types of "exhibitions," except for Mr. Liu Haisu's "solo exhibition," the other two "exhibitions" were held to help refugees. This is so worthy of everyone's admiration!</p>
<p>It is said that the "Exhibition of Small Cold-Season Paintings and Calligraphy" was initiated and organized by Mr. Wen Lanting and Mr. Zhou Bangjun. It gathers the works of small painting and calligraphy experts from all over Shanghai, providing people with the opportunity to view them and marking out the value numbers for people to choose from. The values range from two or three yuan to seventy or eighty yuan. However, those who wish to purchase paintings and calligraphy must pay six yuan uniformly. Purchasers can draw lots, trying their luck to get paintings and calligraphy of high or low value. This method is indeed quite interesting, but those who are really helping the refugees will certainly not care about that "luck"!</p>
<p>The author went to visit at four o'clock in the afternoon on the third day. The walls were full of paintings and calligraphy, truly dazzling. Although the paintings were all landscapes, flowers, or fierce tigers and lions, the themes seemed too far removed from reality. However, because they were all carefully selected works by various artists, even to me, an "outsider," they were truly "too beautiful to behold"! While watching, I couldn't help but feel a sense of reverence for these painting and calligraphy artists. Isn't that right? They are taking out their carefully selected works to help the refugees!</p>
<p>"Getting fine works and doing good deeds," fellow citizens of Shanghai—in the cold northwest wind, when we are wearing heavy winter clothes and don't feel cold, will we think of the large group of compatriots who are suffering for the sake of the motherland? It is hoped that wealthy people and friends who like painting and calligraphy may wish to visit and purchase a few of your favorite books, "getting fine works and doing good deeds," this is truly a "win-win" situation!</p>
<h3>The Cowboy and the Lady</h3>
<p>— Yanhua</p>
<p>"The Cowboy and the Lady"</p>
<p>A United Artists production, playing at the Cathay Theatre</p>
<p>In essence, "The Cowboy and the Lady" is still the old tune of a game of love. It doesn't give us any new enlightenment. The story shows what kind of content it is: it tells of a senator's daughter, whose father wants to participate in the presidential election, so he promises his daughter to a powerful political leader. As a result, his daughter falls in love with a young cattleman who owns a vast ranch, and soon marries him. Her father finally realizes it, gives up his political life, and allows his daughter to gain freedom.</p>
<p>From the content, we can see that it is the same as "Floating Life Like a Dream" and "Wealth is a Fleeting Cloud," passively abandoning career and political life, and praising the greatness of love and paternal love. In fact, this concept is completely wrong. Even if the competition between political parties is based on justice and fairness, then everything should be fought for. If this political party only wants to exploit the masses, they should not only not exist, but should be attacked. However, in these stories of love supremacy, this background is only a subsidiary of the entire film. The main thing that the playwright wants to write is the intricate psychological state of those loves and their rich, romantic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Therefore, the focus of the entire play is still on writing how this senator's daughter met the young cattleman at the cattleman riding competition, and how she randomly teased him for a day on a "blind date," until finally, the senator's daughter became serious and believed that she did love the cattleman, so she tracked down the cattleman and the two got married.</p>
<p>The playwright has been very successful in writing the point that the lifestyles of the lady and the cattleman are absolutely different. One is noble and elegant, and the other is rough and straightforward. Under an absolutely different lifestyle, he wrote about the love between these two people. The director has grasped these places very tightly, both before and after. The humorous atmosphere of writing about Marie teasing Stretch has been handled very lively. Especially when Marie teases Stretch according to the way her two maids tease men, it is full of rich laughter.</p>
<p>After Marie married Stretch, the director also vividly portrayed Marie's disharmonious posture with the rough cattleman's life and her embarrassment. This more fully shows Marie's usual noble life and her pampering.</p>
<p>Even in the scene where Marie cannot come back on Tuesday, the director suddenly sent a telegram that Marie could not come in the burst of laughter of Stretch pretending to push the door, drink, and hug Marie in the empty house under construction. The contrast of emotional air, is extremely successful.</p>
<p>In general technical terms, many parts of "The Cowboy and the Lady" are very cute. Even the ending, having Marie come home first and having Stretch see everyone's happy appearance first, and then introducing Marie's appearance, is a very dramatic technique.</p>
<p>Gary Cooper seems to be more profound and moving than Merle Oberon. Several supporting actors are very good at acting.</p>
<h3>Rain After Clearing</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 3:  Yearning Before the Portrait, Remembering the Old Righteous Man; Educating the Illiterate, Calling the Little Teacher</p>
<p>He Shuangyu said, "So, this elementary school student is his grandson? The child looks very clever and lively." Jin Danyun said, "Isn't that so? It's also pitiful to say! His family had several rooms, but they were completely destroyed by the rampaging enemy planes. His wife was crushed by the collapsing house and suffered serious injuries, dying without being cured. His son was originally a gardener, but due to the double hatred of national and family grievances, he joined the army. Although he didn't die in battle, he died of illness in the army. Some say he was poisoned by the enemy's gas. The old man only had this son. Fortunately, his son left behind a son and a daughter. The daughter is three years older than the son, thirteen years old this year, and the son is ten years old. Both siblings are very intelligent and are studying at the elementary school of the veterans' children's school. Nowadays, elementary schools don't have any exams or anything like that. It's just that on a certain anniversary this year, they had some student performances, and they invited me to give out awards. That elementary school student is named Huang Zhong, and he performed very well. In addition to the school giving him an award, I also visited his home and gave him some prizes. Because my family and they are old acquaintances, I couldn't call him Huang Amao anymore, so I changed my address to call him Old Man Huang. There is a small collective farm here, with a total of more than three hundred mu of land, cultivated using new methods, and the output is very rich. There is also an affiliated livestock and planting company, which is also a cooperative in nature. Old Man Huang is an important member of it. He deeply hates not having studied before and not having read books, but recently he has even been able to read newspapers. For someone who was illiterate to be able to do this, he can be considered truly remarkable." Lin Jiancheng said, "As long as a person can be humble, humility leads to progress. Moreover, in the world today, various fields of knowledge are advancing faster than airplanes; no matter how hard you try to catch up, you won't be able to. The Chinese have always had a saying, 'One can learn until old age, yet learning is never finished.' This means that learning has no end. Now Old Man Huang, an old man, is asking children for instruction. Not only do we not find him shameful, but we should express our respect to him." Jin Danyun said, "To be honest, we Chinese have wasted too much time. As a result, there are too many illiterate people; seventy or eighty percent of the population is illiterate. At that time, we still remember that a Mr. Tao promoted the 'little light student' system. Because children were going to school, but many parents were illiterate. So, he encouraged the children to go home and teach their parents. For example, a grandson teaches his grandfather, a granddaughter teaches her grandmother. Each elementary school student has to go back and teach at least two people in their family. This is called the 'little teacher' system, and it has been very effective." (31)</p>

<h3>Seeking Movie Scripts for the Japanese and Puppets</h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>A Word to Playwrights in the Isolated Island</p>
<p>The wheels of time are constantly turning forward, and a great new era will undoubtedly descend upon us. To promote the arrival of this great new era certainly requires the efforts of the entire nation and the entire society; however, the use of movies for propaganda is also an important tool that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the effectiveness of film propaganda can not only stimulate the minds of the general audience but also change their psychology. Whether in morality, education, culture... movies can change the psychology of the general audience. Therefore, good movies can guide the public to a bright and correct path. Conversely, they can only induce the public to degenerate, become颓唐 (tuí táng, dispirited), passive, and pessimistic.</p>
<p>During the great Anti-Japanese War, the movies we need undoubtedly should contain anti-Japanese content. We must rely on the power of movies to raise public awareness of the Anti-Japanese War, promote the spirit of national resistance and nation-building, and promote the realization of the "final victory." This is an iron law that no one will oppose or criticize. However, precisely because of the greatness of the effectiveness of film propaganda, the Japanese and puppet regime are now working hard to solicit "movie scripts." They are preparing to film the selected scripts and show them in the occupied areas to anesthetize the minds of the compatriots in the occupied areas. The cunning of the Japanese and puppets and the viciousness of their methods are evident!</p>
<p>A notice from the Japanese and puppets soliciting "movie scripts" appeared in a traitorous newspaper in Hongkou, saying, "The new dawn of East Asia is coming! We are eagerly concerned about the so-called new order in East Asia!... Therefore, we are gradually realizing it, in order to reach its pinnacle!... The new China should create new China movies, therefore we need scripts for new China movies. The scope of insertions is broad, but only with the intention of expressing the construction of the new order in East Asia..." The words are seemingly coherent but not, and the sentences are illogical, making one's hair stand on end when read! What should be answered, what should not be answered? This is something that playwrights should seriously recognize.</p>
<p>I, with utmost sincerity, would like to advise playwrights in the isolated island, we must deeply recognize the greatness of our own mission, be wary of the meaning of the Anti-Japanese War, for the sake of the nation, for the sake of the country, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must never covet the few dozen dollars of reward from the Japanese and puppets, and degrade our personality, committing the shameless act of betraying the nation and selling out the country. At the same time, we must further supervise our colleagues, use a faithful attitude, and fulfill the responsibility of friendly advice. In case we discover renegades privately applying, we should impose severe sanctions.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Life (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>The electricity bill for the radio station cannot be owed; some are paid in advance, and some are paid half in advance. This all depends on their usual credit. Those with good credit can pay when the bill is due, but sometimes the broadcasting fees for stores are delayed. Either the boss is not in, or they say to collect it in a few days. If you're unlucky, the store closes down, and you have to eat the bad debt, digging into your own pocket, losing both your time and money. If the electricity bill is not paid on time, the ruthless radio station owner will exercise their right to shut down the equipment and stop broadcasting. At that time, you really have no choice but to scold yourself, "Who told you to eat this broadcasting rice?"</p>
<p>There are also a few broadcasters who are lucky and popular, and they actually have eight or nine programs, busy from morning till night, not even having time to eat. They have chartered cars for transportation, and their names are well-known, so people will come to ask for advice. At that time, they will also put on a stern face and say, "There are no openings; I can't squeeze you in." The more they say that, the more people will come looking for them. The best of them can earn three or four hundred dollars a month, which is more comfortable than being a comprador or company manager. However, there probably isn't even one out of ten broadcasters like that!</p>
<p>The most common time for broadcasting programs is telling stories, even broadcasting until four o'clock the next morning. The most pitiful are these nighttime programs. The listeners are indeed nighttime immortals, mostly from the bourgeoisie, but the broadcasters are suffering. How uneven the joy and suffering of the same person. Moreover, during martial law, those without a pass have to wait until dawn after broadcasting, or sleep on the sofa or even the floor in the broadcasting room, and go back bleary-eyed all the way, how pitiful!</p>
<p>I have been involved in broadcasting life for almost six years, and the programs I broadcast are stories. Fortunately, it's an amateur job, considered a part-time job. Otherwise, how could I make a living? Seeing the lives of many broadcasters, I really feel very miserable. Listeners, after reading my article about broadcasting life, when you are listening to the radio with relish, do you feel how the broadcasters are living?</p>

<h3>Sketches of Dancers (1)</h3>
<p>After spending a long time in dance halls, the purpose is not necessarily to dance. Sometimes, sitting quietly in a corner, observing the various aspects of life, is also quite interesting. In any dance hall, dozens of dancers are always sitting around the edge of the dance floor. They are truly of all shapes and sizes, young and old, with light and heavy makeup, vying for beauty. Looking at their faces is even more interesting. Some are chatting and laughing excitedly, some are happily glancing around with their eyes; some are idle, chatting with their companions while eating melon seeds; some are whispering sweet nothings with dance partners; in short, there are all kinds of expressions, some internal performances, some fake performances. If you have the time to experience them one by one, it's really more interesting than watching a play. Now, because of the limited time, I can't write more. In the next issue, I will systematically classify and describe the various states and reasons of the dancers. Sorry, sorry!</p>

<h3>Skating Technique</h3>
<p>— Lian Junqi and Zhen Hebian (Joint Editors)</p>
<p>Beginner's Introduction (Continued from previous)</p>
<p>Advancing to Retreating Method: When moving, bend both feet to the right, using the outside edge of the right foot (i.e., the outer wheel) and the inside edge of the left foot (i.e., the inner two wheels). When both feet face right, the body will turn smoothly to the right, with the center of gravity on the left foot, so both feet will be in opposite directions. (i.e., when facing south and advancing forward, the toes first turn south, then turn the body and retreat, and after the action, the toes point north.) However, the direction of movement remains unchanged, i.e., still moving south. (The method for turning left is the same.)</p>
<p>Turning Method (A): When turning to the right, the body faces to the right side, both knees are bent, and the left foot is moved in front of the right foot. Both feet land and move until the end of the turn, as shown in the lower half of the diagram.</p>
<p>(B) After learning the previous method, the crossover method can be used. When turning right, cross the left foot over the right foot to the right, with the left foot applying force on the inside edge and the right foot applying force on the outside edge. Alternate pushing, and it will become like the upper half of the diagram. (Turning left is analogous.)</p>
<p>Stopping Method for Roller Skates (A): Stopping while moving forward: When stopping, place one foot behind the other, forming a T-shape, and let the two inner wheels drag on the ground to stop. The weight of dragging should be directly proportional to the speed of the movement. That is, drag heavily when moving fast, and drag lightly when moving slowly. This method requires alternating practice with both feet until you can stop at will.</p>
<p>(B) Stopping when moving backward: When stopping, lift one foot's toes and drag it lightly on the ground.</p>
<p>Stopping Method for Ice Skates: Use a small turning method to make the blade of the shoe bottom perpendicular to the direction of movement. Point both shoe heads inward and use the inside edge of the shoe to move until both toes meet. Lean the body backward and let the tip of the heel bite into the ice (this is the stopping method for flat-bottom shoes). The knees should be bent when stopping. Lift one foot and place it in a T-shape in front of the other foot.</p>
<p>The first and second methods are easy to learn, but the second method is not very elegant. The third method looks best.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (96)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Huang San, Liu Chungui, and Jin Xiushan All Came from Amateur Backgrounds</p>
<p>Jin Xiushan and Liu Yongchun both came from humble backgrounds. Xiushan played "wooden puppet" shows, using a bed sheet to cover himself and singing the roles of several people by himself inside the sheet. Liu Chun played Australian shadow puppet shows, and his nickname was "Shadow Puppet Liu." Later, they both abandoned their original professions and entered the world of actors, becoming famous Jing (painted-face) actors. However, in the backstage, they were most afraid of people mentioning the word "钻" (zuān, drill), which could also mean to '钻被单(zuān bèi dān, to hide under a quilt.)' If someone said "钻锅" (zuān guō, drill a pot), they would also become suspicious. This was similar to Gui Fen being afraid of people saying "big" or "small." If someone held a gun and said, "This gun is good, but unfortunately, the head is big," or "the barrel is short," he could immediately fight with them. Because he was born with a big head and a small body, he was most afraid of people pointing out his shortcomings. Jin and Liu were engaged in lowly professions, so they were naturally even more averse to these things.</p>
<p>Xiushan was a Jing actor who was between the Tongchui (i.e., Da Hualian, also called Zheng Jing, main painted face) and Fu Jing (also called Er Hualian, second painted face) roles. His acting ethics were not bad. Because he felt that he was not suitable for treacherous hero roles, he always did not want to play Cao Cao and tried to avoid Huang San's path. Therefore, he was famous for plays such as "Stabbing Liao," "Muhu Guan," "Mengliang Steals the Bones," "Imperial Fruit Garden," "Exploring Yin Mountain," "Bailiang Guan," and "Dragon Tiger Fight." Plays like "Famen Temple" and "Loyalty and Filial Piety Complete," which featured great eunuchs, were his specialties. His son, Shaoshan, still does not often play Cao Cao. According to him, it is also because he is abiding by his father's last words.</p>
<p>Liu Yongchun was indeed a Tongchui orthodox. He was completely different from Huang and Jin. His signature plays were "Caoqiao Pass," "Ascending to Heaven," "Entering the Palace," "Zha Meian," etc. Especially the play "Shatu Kingdom," he considered himself extraordinary in it. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, I visited him at his residence to discuss some lost old plays. He said indignantly, "The play 'Shatu Kingdom' was originally my unique skill. Who would have thought that since Xin Du made it popular under the name 'Zhuli Lianzhai,' we painted-face actors have not often performed it. In fact, what kind of taste is he singing?" As he spoke, he suddenly felt a theatrical urge, and while tapping the table with his hand, he hummed and sang to me. At that time, although he was almost seventy years old, indeed that kind of calm taste was truly unmatched. Later, because of charity performances, this old man also sang a "Catching and Releasing Cao" with Bai Mei Wang Yufang. Both of them had good voices, which was really gratifying. However, the combined age of the two was also one hundred and fifty or sixty.</p>
