<p>社評</p>
<h3>討汪精衛！</h3>
<p>前月近衛的在妄演說，原為一種誘和的試探。自從蔣委員長痛加駁斥以後，日本的鬼蜮伎倆已告失敗。不料在氏身居中樞耍職，竟在棄職潛逃之後，膽敢向中央公然主張對日本乞降。蔣委員長會指出「防共是滅亡中國的代名詞，」在竟主張「防共」；蔣委員長曾指出「所謂無領土要求實際是囊括中國，」在竟說這是「中日言和」的基礎；蔣委員長又曾明白指出「經濟集團謬說的目的是在奴役中國，」在竟又說這是「可以贊同的原則」。總觀他的一篇謬論，沒有一點不是違反了最高領袖所昭示的國策，沒有一點不是曲體了日本滅亡中國的意旨，認賊作父，喪心病在，可謂達於極點！所幸在氏的在囈發表以後，立刻引起全國上下的一致痛斥，並紛紛主張聲討，可見中國人民抗戰到底的意志已同鋼鐵一樣的堅决，任何妥協份子决無存在的餘地。這卻又是一件令人萬分感奮之事。</p>
<p>我們看了在氏這决彰明較著「通敵求降」的在囈，不禁又想起了他過去幾决中傷抗戰的言論，可知他蓄意叛國，已非一朝一夕。舉幾個例子說：長沙大火以後，蔣委員長及中宣部曾發表宣言，說明這决失事完全是由於地方當局臨事慌張的綠故，但在氏却竟趁此機會大放厥詞，中傷焦土抗戰的國策。其次，中國的抗戰是持久戰，而在持久戰歷程中，遊擊戰顯然佔着重要地位，這曾經軍事領袖的一再昭示，而中國人民誰都知道的。可是在氏却又多方中傷，竟妄說遊擊隊一遊來遊去」，等於一明末的流寇」。此外，如關於外交問題，最高領袖曾經屢决指出「應該認淸友敵的原則，而在氏却又竭力主張從日本的帮兇各國中間去尋找與國。自從抗戰發動以來，汪氏利用他崇高的地位，屢决發表這種歪曲事實中傷抗戰的言論，冋知他對於中國抗戰的國策，完全沒有認識，對於中國抗戰必然勝利的前途，根本沒有信心。理論和行動是一致的，手段和目的是不可分的。一味歪曲的理論，决沒有正確的行動；反對正確的手段，一定是反對目的。這在今天又於在氏身上得到一個證明。</p>
<p>在氏叛國的面目已明白顯露於國人之前了，中央黨部也己宣佈他的罪狀，决議開除他的黨籍了。這實在是一個可喜的現象，因為這不僅表示中國國民黨在抗戰中的進步，同時也表示中國政治的向上發展。我們已經說過，在氏是一個沒有羣衆的光桿子，他的棄職潛逃，不僅不足以絲毫影響中國的抗戰，並且反而澄淸了中國抗戰的機構，不僅不會（像侵略者和漢奸所宣傳的）促成中國內部的分裂，並且反會使民族統一戰綫愈益鞏固起來。在中國堅定抗戰的今天，致治機構中本不容有動搖妥協份子的存在，去了一個動搖妥協份子，等於去了一團有毒的殘渣，增加了一分抗戰的力量。</p>
<p>但是，在氏雖然逃亡了，他的罪逆却必得受國法的制裁，况且他身任國民黨副總裁及其他中樞要職，更不能加以寬容。我們覺得僅僅開除他的黨籍，還嫌不足，故希望國民政府也立即下令，把他通緝，依法懲辦，</p>
<p>我們又知道，在氏的叛國行動决不只是他一人的行動，一定還有許多羽黨，潛伏在政府機關裹面，進行着不利抗戰的陰謀。我們希望國民政府對於彼等，也嚴加檢舉，予以處分！國府昨天已明令重申「漢奸懲戒條例」了，明令中已規定「潛作漢奸敢冒天下之大不韙者」亦應嚴緝懲辦。</p>
<p>新年乍臨，中國的抗戰是日益向有利的方面發展着。在精衛叛跡的暴露，使抗戰陣綫愈益分明，中國抗戰的政治機構日益澄淸，而中國抗戰的前途也愈見其光芒萬丈！</p>

<h3>完成我們神聖使命</h3>
<p>— 孫科</p>
<p>時光荏苒，現在又是中華民國二十八年開始的時候了！大家所憶念的，當然是這一年零六個月的神聖抗戰；大家所追求的，當然是今後光明燦爛之前途，我們不能認爲過去的都一定滿意，但起碼可以這樣說；抗戰總是令人滿意的，抗戰是爲了求國家的獨立，民族的解放，四萬萬五千萬黃帝子孫的自由平等，抗戰本身的重要價値，當然會使任何人謳歌讚佩，而且抗戰即是革命「，吾人之不能懷疑抗戰，即如吾人之不能懷疑革命，實具同一之意義。</p>
<p>但是搞抗戰並不是為了抗戰而抗戰，抗戰只是手段，並不是目的，我們的目的，乃在建設一個三民主義的新中國。因爲三民主義的新中國，是國際平等，——（民族主義）是政治平等，——（民權主義）是經濟平等；——（民生主義）抗戰便是在打倒日本帝國主義的侵略勢力，並進而謀民族主義，民權主義，民生主義之全部實現。因此，大家所追求的，乃爲一抗戰必勝，建國必成」的光明燦爛之新中國前途！</p>
<p>怎樣去實現這個前途呢？這便是我們大家的任務！</p>
<p>目的旣然懸在我們的前面，責任旣然擱在我們每一個人的肩上，今後大家着力之點，應該注意下列幾件事：</p>
<p>第一，要具有民族自尊心和自信心的堅强信念。我們並不否認中華民族已具有若干弱點，巳暴露了許多敗德，但五千多年的歷史文化的悠久，這是仟何一國所趕不上的；中國人愛和平，重信義，耐勤儉的風習，也比任何民族都優異；中國人並不比西洋人愚昧，中國人天賦的聰明才智，的確是超人一等。不過因爲敎育程度之不普及，及政洽經濟社會各方面尚未達到近代化的水準，所以尚呈顯着許多缺點，這也正是中國所以被强敵侵略壓迫的原因。惟侵略壓迫正可視爲警覺我們，敎訓我們，改善我們的唯一機會！我們絕對不能够動搖自己對民族自尊心和自信心的堅强信念！假使自己對自己國家民族的信念根本發生動搖，那只有宣佈精神破產，宣佈屈膝投降，乾乾脆脆降志辱身去做帝國主義的俘虜，去做日本人的奴隷好了！這種喪失了自信的人，在民族說是應該淘汰的渣滓，在個人說是天下第一等的蠢才。</p>
<p>第二，要具有對目前軍事政治有澈底了解和樂觀的心情。有些人爲什麼對時局悲觀？對抗戰前途發生懷疑？甚至希望妥協求和呢？這無疑的由於他們對軍事政治外交的前途。估計不淸，觀察不明所致。當然我們也不否認這一年多的喪師失地情形，是失敗而不是勝利；但要知道事事落後的弱小民族對帝國主義之抗戰，這失敗是必所難免之事。假使我們沒有失敗的既定形勢在先，日帝國主義者也根本不會來橫施侵略了！所以抗戰一起，所爭者乃為最後之勝利，而非一地一城之得失，及速戰速决之優劣。怎樣去爭取最後勝利呢？蔣委員長已經明白說過：爭的「持久戰」，是爭的「全面戰」，是爭的「主動戰」；目前正是全面戰的展開，持久戰與主動戰開始的時候。我們所爭者，乃是在目前這種階段裹面，去怎樣消耗敵人？怎樣困斃敵人？必須經過一定時期之後，才能够以大的反攻來决定最後之勝利。所以就現階段的戰略來說，根本用不着悲觀，同時，是只有樂觀的？軍事上，一切進入有利的形勢？政治上，比戰前也進步得多，改善得多；財政上除了努力生產，以平衡滙價外，最近又得到英美借款的支持；外交上，國際形勢的積極好轉，更屬有目共睹之事。再看敵人：他們一般國民反戰情緒之增高；他們兵員的補充已發生根本問題；他們財政更是羅掘已窮，崩潰在即；至於外交之孤立失助，行見遭受重大之打擊，其困難更不待論。所以我們從任何方面看，都是樂觀的！我們固然有許多地方已感覺到捉襟見肘，其實敵人比我們捉襟見肘的地方更多，我們為什麽只看重敵人而看輕自己哩！一切動搖的觀念，悲觀的情緒，大家應該澈底把他克服！澈底把他肅淸！</p>
<p>第三，要有刻苦自動，咬定牙根的吃苦精神和奮鬥精神。前面已經說過：我們所爭取的是「最後勝利」，大家便要知道。越最後」，則其所經過之困難越多，所遭受之痛苦越大。戰爭，本來是「不得已而爲之」，人類所求的是和平，而並不是戰爭，其所以不得已而出於抗戰之一途者，原在爲民族求生存，爲國家爭獨立而義無反顧。在此意義之下，只要是對民族國家有益，只要其所付之犧牲代價，足以有裨於民族之生存，國家之獨立，凡是仟何艱難困苦，我們都只好拼命忍受下去！所以我們希望全國的同胞同志們，無論在前方，或在後方，無論是出錢也好，或出力也好，總得咬定牙關，吃苦到底；同時要以「死裹求生」之精神去作有敵無我之鬥爭。現在有的人因爲侷促在西南一隅，因為懷想到家鄕淪陷，產業蕩然，因為日感生活之壓迫，處境之不易，於是由平時養尊處優之心情生出此時妥協投降之觀念，這是一個最堪恥辱的現象！其實，就目前的許多事實觀察，似乎除了前敵將士而外，後方的人何嘗吃了些什麼苦頭？我們只見着畸形的繁榮，只見着無謂的浪費，那裹趕得上歐戰時那般國家的嚴格統制！那裏趕得上歐戰時那般國民的節衣縮食！中國目前這種情形，誠然是病態，誠然須得力加矯正，但另一方面正表現中國的地大物博，蘊藏豐富，經濟彈性力之太遠非日帝國主義者所能望其項背。只要大家能吃苦，只要大家洞達人生的眞義，能把個人的生活標準，生活慾望，加以調　，同時以其力，以其財盡量貢獻給國家。那嗎，不要說與敵人打三五年，便是十年八年，以至百年戰爭，中國都儘有力量可以撑持下去！問題即在我們能吃苦，肯奮鬥。</p>
<p>第四，要以抗戰建國綱領來作爲我們刻苦奮鬥的唯一目標。長期抗戰本來是一個極艱苦卓絕的工作，而其所以艱苦卓絕者，不在抗戰之本身，允在抗戰與建國之同時並進。本黨臨時全國代表大會宜曾，對於這一點說得最爲淸楚：「吾人當竭其全力爲國家民族爭取生存與獨立，同時根據三民主義，繼續不斷完成政治上，經濟上之建設，俾中國獲得自由平等於世界。吾人亦知中國目前若能和平之環境，則此等建設完成當較易，然日本帝國主義之侵略，着着深人，已使和平歸於絕望。此次抗戰，在事勢上爲必然發生，且無可避免。吾人不能望於和平中謀建設，惟當使抗戰與建設，同時並行。是則救亡的責任，實同時落於吾人之肩上」。至於如何抗戰建國呢？三民主義是我們最高指導原則，抗戰建國綱領是我們原理原則的寮行方針。現在我們所要檢討的，即是這些抗建綱領，究竟實踐了沒有？或實踐了幾分之幾？我們所要努力的，即是怎樣使戰時建國工作發展到戰爭停止以後便會一變而爲民族復興的政治基礎和經濟基礎？譬如說戰時的國營貿易，工礦調整等，在戰後即能達到發達國家資本，節制私人資本之目的；戰時的參政制度，兵役制度等，在戰後即能達到民權主義，地方自治，自由徵兵之目的。……總之，我們在此一面抗戰，一面建國的奮鬥過程中，要時時刻刻都不能離開我們的綱領，要時時刻刻都在爲實現三民主義而努力。</p>
<p>根據上述各點，第一堅决了對自已民族的自尊心和自信心，於是他「有所本」了！第二澈底瞭然於敵我之情况，而心安理得，於是他「不動搖」了！第三抱定犧牲奮鬥，到底不懈之决心與敵人作持久戰，於是「最後勝利」屬於我了！第四本着一定的方針目標努力幹下去，於是在戰時不虞「內潰」，在戰後可以「復興」了！——這樣，便是我們光明燦爛之前途！大家必須　起直追來完成我們的神聖使命！</p>

<p>（東京）今日此間消息靈通方面相信、日本或將拒絕美國主張召集國際會議解决中日爭端之提議、至美國來文、各報皆刋載之、但未作何評論、今日政府機關休假、是以未能探得官塲對此美牒文之評論、半官方而表示、該牒文係羅斯福總統之一種政治方略、俾使美國對外政策爲彼於明日新開幕之國會中所提出第一咨文中之方針云、（二日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>德國亟須　推廣對外貿易　深恐南美隨英美抵貨　國內消費品工人缺乏</h3>
<p>（柏林）截至一九三八年年底爲止、德國經濟之特點、厥爲民衆雖保有購買力、但消費品相當缺乏、國社黨各領袖雖曾一再宣稱、「立國之本、在於勞工、而不在於黃金、外國方面若果以爲德國現行政制、可因金融問題而傾覆、實甚謬誤、」但實際上德國經濟所遭遇之困難、正因勞工問題而起、例如某某部門、尤其是農業、營造業、礦業、冶金業、工人與技師、均感缺乏、影響所及、各種消費品之產量、卽不免因之减少、查國社黨政府爲吸收失業工人起見、曾於一九三三年起、增加許多工作機會、各業工人與職員總數、在一九三三年原爲一二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人者、迄至去年、已增加至二一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人、其中農業方面、甚至僱用外國工人一二〇·〇〇〇人、因此、各業人工不敷情形、益見明顯、加之、德國政府復在西陲積極建造防禦工事、自各業抽調之工人、爲數旣甚衆多，政府陸軍與國社黨向各業訂購貨物時、又令英儘先交貨、德國經濟所受桎梏、因而愈益加重、德國當局現擬以機器代替入工、藉資補救、但爲積極製造機器起見、各種消費品之生產事業、卽不得不退居决要地位、社會上亦卽因此打破均勢、工人人數雖見增加、其工資雖見提高、但空有金錢、而無法購得各種消費品、允其是脂肪與紡織品、此卽德國經濟之主要癥結所在、爲改善此種局勢計、德國各當局並無延緩進行軍備計畫之意、其唯一口號、仍爲「寗有大砲、不食牛油、」同時又因無法提高捐稅、以致引起民間反感之故、仍不得不勸導人民、以簡接的方法、消耗其金錢、例如鼓勵人民、購買無綫電收音機、儲款訂購「平民汽車」、參加集團旅行、比比皆是、此外、獎勵出口業一項問題、亦足以阻碍消費品製造業之正常發展、良以德國工業、必須輸出貨物、以換取本國所缺乏之原料品、但去年一年中、德國出口貨數量大見减少，德國各當局深恐英美兩國聯合抵制德國之外、南美洲各國卽因而爲所影響、此於德國經濟極爲危險、因此必須以全力發展對外貿易、而將純粹供國內消費各業、置於决要地位、此民間消費品不敷應用之又一原因也（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英德兩國　海軍談判　英輿論大為不安</h3>

<p>（倫敦）德國政府自要求將潛水艇噸位、提高至與英國潛水艇噸位相等、並將甲級巡洋艦自五艘增至七艘而後、英國輿論界業已爲之不安、外務部雖於前日發表公報、加以安慰、似無多大效果、各報甚至聲言、一九三五年英德海軍協定、若果予以修正、則英國海軍預算即須大見增加、其中每日電聞報載稱、「吾國空軍擴充計劃所需款項、或須提高至七九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、茲德國政府又欲將潛水艇噸位提高至與吾國相埒、則吾國原有之驅逐艦與海軍飛機建造計劃、又須比例予以擴大、然則吾國下年度國防計劃所需全部經費、或須提高至一二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊亦屬可能」、每日快報較爲樂觀、據載稱、「德國此種要求、不必加以重視、該國所造之小型潛水艇隊、在英國視之、並不足以爲患、即德國元首希特勒在公海上亦無意向英國挑戰、英德兩國海軍協定、在實質上仍然有效」、新聞記事報載稱、德國所造之潛水艇隊、在戰時可以較大之威力、控制地中海上英國之交通綫、「似此、德國雖有要求修改英德海軍協定之權、英國對於德國建造威力較大的新潛水艇之議、自亦有權予以拒絕」云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法義糾紛　張伯倫將斡旋　並當乘便訪問敎皇　請調停西班牙內戰</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於法義兩國現行關係、法國政府雖已明白說明、不願英國調處、但據此間所獲情報、義相墨索里尼仍當竭力慫恿張伯倫首相、將義國各項要求代達法國、英國駐義大使潘恩勛爵素來主張、宜就義國各項要求進行談判、甚至發出暗示云、英國若果拒不進行談判、其事殊屬危險、義相墨索里尼因而益信、一俟張伯倫首相前往羅馬聘問、定可促其出面調處、但以寮際情形而論、英國政府匪特不贊成潘恩大使之見解、甚且認爲法國能度完全正當而又巧妙、則以法國拒絕調處之後、義國卽欲獲有决要的讓步、亦不得不首先發動、以與德國重開談判故也、此在張伯倫首相左右人士則謂、首相聘問羅馬時、不致就義國各項要求之正當與吾、加以討論、僅當提出若干一般性質的見解、卽（一）義國務當首先發動、而向法國提出合理的解决方案、（二）義國干涉西班牙國內亂一項問題、倘能予以解决、法國當可以較爲順適的態度出之云、此外、張伯倫首相所致力者、聞以西班牙問題爲主、其意係謂、西國內戰調處問題、實乃國際時局筦鑰之一、此項戰事、倘能予以結束、則外國干涉行動、不難一舉而廓淸之、卽各民治國與各獨裁國相互接近一項政策、能吾賡續進行一層一亦可因此獲有答案、準此而論、張伯倫首相乘聘問義國之便、晋謁敎皇庇護斯十一世之舉、至堪重視、其與敎皇談及調處問題、實乃毫無疑問之事云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據西班牙政府軍及國民軍中路透社隨軍記者來電、政府軍對於國民軍進攻加泰隆之軍隊、仍繼續予以重大之壓迫、據巴薩羅納消息、義國軍各師團、現正進攻勒利達與泰拉哥那中間之維尼克薩鎮、政府守軍在該區叢山內所設之機關鎗陣地、每日遭受猛烈之砲火及空襲、已被迫逐漸放棄其堅强之據點、惟政府軍常於夜間實行包抄襲攻、以收復失地、聞此項戰事中、有極兇猛之肉搏、據政府軍宣稱、國民軍之前進、犧牲極大、且在軍事上尚不能證明此舉究與政府有何危險、據布爾哥斯發來戰報、謂加泰隆馬德里及瓦倫西亞三處前錢、均有戰事、又據西班牙新聞通訊社消息、瓦倫西亞前方現有苦戰、並承認伐爾狄孚沃附近卡斯希羅孛莫羅村已經失陷、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>第二條　淞滬商埠督辦公署設督辦一人，由聯軍總司令兼任之，綜理一切政務；總辦一人，由總司令任命之，禀承督辦，監督指導本署各職員，執行本署職務。督辦不在署時，得由總辦代行職務。但遇有重要事項，仍須請示辦理。</p>
<p>第六條　外交處掌理商埠區域內一切外交事務。</p>
<p>第七條　政務處掌理商埠區域內一切行政事務。</p>
<p>第八條　保安處掌理商埠區域內一切治安及衛生事務。</p>
<p>第九條　工務處掌理商埠區域內公共建築之港務，道路，橋梁，河道及市自治之土木工程事務。</p>
<p>第十條　財政處掌理本公署及商埠區域內收入支出事務。孫氏就職時，聲稱：「去年江浙戰事後，東南大局，暫告平靖，惟淞滬問題亟待解决。前决政府雖有淞滬劃作特區之擬議，但迄未成爲事實，人民渴望已久。目下江浙已成一家，淞滬開闢商埠更急不容緩，故特着手組織，於最短期間內宣告成立。督辦一職因行使職權上關係。不能劃分，不得已由鄙人兼任。惟余軍務旁午，時間上頗有困難，故特請丁君文江充任總辦，俾可就近負責進行。淞滬商埠督辦公署成立後，請地方紳士嚴予督促，以臻完善。」孫氏就職後，發出布告云：</p>
<p>「爲布告事，照得本署現在組織成立。查淞滬商埠督辦公署組織大綱第二條內開。。「淞滬商埠督辦公署設督辦一人，由聯軍總司令兼任之」等情。據此，本聯軍總司令擇於中華民國十五年五月初四日午前十時就兼任督辦之職，爲此布告，仰爾軍民人等一體知悉，切切，特此布告。</p>
<p>淞滬商埠督辦公署總辦丁文江於十二月十二日因撞車受傷而辭職。其在職時間爲七閱月。七閱月中以收回會審公廨一事最有意義，因其與租界有關也，茲請略述其經過。</p>
<p>當民國八年五四運動發生後，上海市民始知參加政治運動之實效。其時公共租界工部局適將增收捐稅，市民乃亦共籌抵制之策，一面要求工部局打銷增稅之議，一方要求工部局須設華董等，翌年一月工部局允設立華顧問五人。五卅慘案起後，國人方面提出十三條件，其中有設華董及收回公廨等條，雖未能全獲勝利，然收回會審公廨問題終告相當解决。</p>
<p>領事團之佔領會審公廨管理權，係在辛亥革命之時。自民國二年冬起，我國屢經交涉，終鮮結果。五卅案起，收回會審公廨列爲十三條件之一；但爲公使團所反對。其後政府將收回公廨一條與其他條伴劃分，單獨交涉，决定於民國十五年春在北京開議。然因政局不穩，談判無效。江蘇省政府乃乘機而起，與領事團作爲地方案件交涉。自孫傳芳來滬就淞滬商埠督辦職時起，由丁文江向領團開始交涉，至八月三十一日始訂立收回上海會審公廨暫行章程九條。此項章程，頗富歷史價値，使學界常須取以研究，特錄如後：</p>
<p>第一條（甲）江蘇省政府就上海公共租界原有之會審公廨改設臨時法庭，除照條的屬於各國領事裁判權之案件外，凡租界內民刑案件，均由臨時法庭審理。（乙）凡現在適用於中國法庭之一切法律（訴訟法在內）及條例，及以後制定公佈之法律條例，均適用於臨時法庭；惟當顧及本章程之規定及經將來協議所承認之會審公　訴訟慣例。（丙）凡與租界治安直接有關之刑事案件以及違犯洋涇浜章程及附則各案件，暨有領事裁判　的國人民所僱用華人爲刑事被告之案件，均得由領袖領事派委員一人觀審。該員得與審判官並坐，凡審判官之判决，無須得該委員之同意，即生效力；但該委員有權將其不同意之點詳載紀錄。又，如無中國審判官之許可，該委員對於證人及被告人，不得加以訊問。（丁）所有法庭之傳票，拘票及命令，經由審判官之簽字，即生效力，前項傳票，拘票及命令在施行之前，應責成書記官長編號登記。凡在有領事裁判權的國人民居住之所執行之傳票，拘票及命令，該關係國領事或該管官員於送到時應即加簽，不得遲延。（戊）凡有領事裁判權國人民或工部局爲原告之民事案件，及有領事裁判權國人民爲告訴人之刑事案件，得由該關係國領事或領袖領事按照條的規定，派官員一人，會同審判官出庭。（已）臨時法庭外另設上訴庭，專辦與租界治安直接有關之刑事上訴案件及華洋訴訟之刑事上訴案件。其庭長由臨時法庭庭長兼任。但五等有期徒刑以下及違犯洋涇浜章程與附則之案件，不得上訴。凡初審時領袖領事派員觀審之案件，上訴時，該領袖領事得另派員觀審，其權隄及委派手續與初審時委員相同。至華洋訴訟之刑事上訴案件，亦照同樣辦法，由領事易員出庭。（庚）臨時法庭之庭長，推事及上訴庭之推事，由省政府任命之。</p>
<p>第二條　臨時法庭判處十年以上徒刑及死刑案件，須由該法庭呈請省政府核准，其不核准之案件，即由省政府將不核准理由令知法庭，復行訊斷，呈請省政府再核。凡核准死刑之案，送咬租界外交廳執行。租界內檢騐事宜，由臨時法庭推事會同領袖領事所派之委員執行。</p>
<p>第三條　凡附屬臨時法院之監獄，除民事拘留所及女監當另行規定外，責成工部局，務處派員專管。但一切管理方法，應在可以實行範圍之內，遵照中國管理監獄章程辦理，並受臨時法庭之監督。法庭庭長應派察員團隨時前往調查，該委員團應於領袖領事所派委員中加入一人。如對於管理人犯認有欠妥之處，應即報告法庭，將不妥之處責成工部局立予改良，工部局警務處應卽照辦，不得遲延。</p>
<p>第四條　臨時法院之傳蔡，拘票，命令，應由司法務察執行。此項法警由工部局警務處選派，但在其執行法警職務時應直接對於法庭負責。凡臨時法庭向工部局警務處所需求或委托事件，工部局警務處應卽竭力協助進行。至工部局警察所拘提之人，除放假時日不計外，應於二十四小時內送由臨時法庭訊辦，逾時應卽釋放。</p>
<p>第五條　凡經有領事派員會同審判官出庭之華洋民事案件，如有不服初審判决之時，應向特派交涉員署提起上訴，由交涉員按照條的，的同有關係領事審理，但得交原審法庭易員復審；其領事所派之官員，亦須更易。倘交涉員與領事對於曾經復審案件上訴時不能同意，卽以復審判决爲定。</p>
<p>第六條　法庭出納及雙方合組委員會所規定之事務，應責成書記官長管理，該書記官長由領袖領事推薦，再由臨時法庭是請省政府委派，受臨時法庭庭長之監督指揮，管理屬員，並妥爲監督法庭度支，如該書記官長有不勝任及溺職之行爲，臨時法庭庭長得加以懲戒，如遇必要時，經領袖領事同意，得將其撤換。</p>
<p>第七條　以上六條，係江蘇省政府收回會審公廨之暫行章程。其施行期限爲三年，以交還會審公廨之日起算。在此期內，中央政府得隨時向有關係之各國公使交涉最後解决辦法。如上項辦法雙方一經同意本暫行章程當即廢止。如三年期滿，北京交涉仍無最後解决辦法，本暫行章程應繼續施行三年，惟於第一决三年期滿時，省政府得於期滿前六個月通知提議修正。</p>
<p>第八降　將來不論何時，中國中央政府與各國政府交涉撤消領事裁判權時，不受本暫行章程任何拘束。</p>
<p>第九條　本暫行章程所規定交還會審公廨辦法之履行日期，應由江蘇省政府代表與領袖領事另行換定之。</p>
<p>民國十六年一月一日會審公廨正式交還，在租界中喪失十餘年之司法權，至此方開始收回。</p>
<h3>從奢侈說到敎育</h3>
<p>— 王雲五</p>
<p>（轉錄本報香港版星期評論）</p>
<p>本文雖對聚居香港之中國高等難民而發，然匕海孤島之中國人士，與各處來此之高等難民，亦多染奢侈之惡習，故有轉錄以貢獻一般讀者之價値。</p>
<p>日昨此間報載：法國新歐羅巴雜誌記者李蒙氏，於重慶某記者訪問時，曾作左列一段的談話：</p>
<p>一在廣州失陷二周後，我們到了香港，一般中國人士把大量的金錢，花在舞塲酒樓和高等旅舍裹。這種反常的情形，只有「可怕」二字才能勉强的形容出來」。</p>
<p>這裹「可怕」二字的評語，可謂十分切當，也可謂實獲我心。（中略）中國人士爲何如此奢侈，有何方法可以正本淸源；請略論之。</p>
<p>我以爲我國現今的奢侈風氣，直接或間接都與敎育有關係。一方面，像我國古代所謂一簞食，一瓢飲，在陋巷，不改其樂——那一種的安貧樂道的敎育，實際上雖久已不存在，惟流風餘韻猶能支配一部分好名的讀書人。但自海通以來，淫巧貨品大量輸入，好奇好美之性出自天賦，物質上的誘惑旣不易抵抗，而西方的拜金主義又接踵傳入我國，足以助長國人對於物質的欲望。及我國施行新敎育，因襲西方的功利主義，而未能接受其犧牲精神，流弊所至，祗知聚財而不知散財，於是奢侈好貨的風氣，不僅超越前古，亦視任何他國爲甚。他方面，則學校敎科大都屬於應世就業的準備，對於餘暇的正當消遣，並沒有注意，或很少注意。其實現代職業的工作時間本不甚長，而曾受高等敎育者，職位大致較高，工作時間也較短。一晝夜二十四小時中，八小時睡眠，八小時作業，尚有八小時，除起居飲食外，大部分即爲休閒的時間。此種時間利用得宜，則直接有益於身心，間接有益於業務；反之，非徒有害於身心，實亦有害於業務。蓋餘暇之消遣不得當，除消耗精神不能認眞服務外，勢必浪費金錢。古人云「不足生於無度」；又云「惟儉可以助廉」：不儉與不足之結果，幾無有不傷廉者。所以國家要提倡廉潔政治，社會要養成廉潔風氣；首須厲行節儉，而節儉目的之達到，實有賴於敎育方針的變更與善用餘暇的訓練。</p>
<p>關於敎育方針的變更，說來未免過長，容當另行論述：茲專就善用餘暇一項言之。我以爲欲善用餘暇，莫如於修學時期內養成（一）讀書的興趣，（二）體育的興趣，或（三）藝術的興趣</p>
<p>讀書的興趣本來是學校向所注重的事；但實際上我國學生離開學校以後，多數拋棄書本。這種現象不僅爲一般人所承認，並有事實爲證。就出版業的營業而論，全國全年的總數不過二千五百萬元，比諸上海英美公司一家的營業，還不及十分之一。就出版物的數量而論，日本人口不滿九千萬，而昭和十二年新刊的普通出版物共三一九九六册；我國人口不下五萬萬，而民國二十五年之新出版物僅九四三八册，的當日本百分之三十。又查日本每種出版物平均印數，至少五倍於我國，故以實際印售總册數論，我國一年間的新出版物僅及日本百分之六；但我國人口雖比日本五倍而强，然曾受敎育的人數在人口中所佔成分或僅及日本五分之一，如此一增一减，則我國會受敎育者之購書數量，實亦等於日本的百分之六。從這兩例觀察，不得不承認我國學校對於讀書興趣的養成實大失敗。究其原因，雖甚複雜；然敎育方法之傾向於被動，未能養成學生自動修學的習慣，關係實最重大。所謂被動的傾向者，蓋指自小學以至中學皆釆貫注式的敎學法；學生所修習者僅爲課本，敎者以是敎，學者亦以是學，久而久之，便養成一種倚頓　本的被動習慣，而不能鼓起自動的讀書興趣。甚至大學生，在理應多作自動的研究，然一因中小學的習慣漸成自然，一因圖書館的藏書，除極少例外，皆甚短缺，故實際殆與中小學無大區別；所修習者僅爲講義，或兼及極少數參考書，讀書的與趣也就不易鼓起。一旦離開學校，課本講義旣無甩處，便很少閱讀其他的書籍。按讀書興趣當從開始時養成；因人性本好奇，讀書可以滿足好奇之心，在理識字的人無不喜自動讀書者，徒以小學中學的敎育積久漸成自然，故一變而爲被動耳。如能於中小學校中，隨學生的能力而逐漸加重其自動研究的成分，尤其是自動搜集資料的工作；而各級學校圖書館的設備叉能滿足此項要求：則在學校時對於讀書必益感興趣，離校後亦必能保持此種興趣也。</p>
<p>體育的興趣亦與有生而俱來；蓋體育的基礎，即爲身體的運動也。試看幼童除有病者外，無不活潑跳躍，即其愛好運動的明證。叉試看學校體育塲的人滿與其活潑情况，亦即愛好運動的徵象。但體育與自然的身體運動，其區別在規律之有無，而身體運動之能長保共興趣，亦賴有規律之存在。現在各學校均設有體育科目，然而學生在校時始終感覺興趣者僅占少數，共離校後能維持此興趣者允不多見。推原其故，或因課室功課過多，顧此不免失彼；或因參加機會太少，一暴不免十寒。加以學校體育之目的，往往側重錦標，設施未能普遍；故擅長體育者多無暇讀書，而認眞讀書者又無暇參加體育；以致人人應受的體育訓練，往往成爲少數人的專業，結果實與體育的本旨相悖。考其所以致此，實與設施的體育方式頗有關係。蓋學校最流行的體育，如足球田徑等，均需要較大的塲所：而足球等旣有人數的限制，田徑等則參加者之程度又不能不稍整齊；經此種種淘汰與障礙，於是卓越蓉固占先，平凡者遂落後：少數占先者面成爲錦標的人材，而大多數落後者，在理對於體育的需要允切，却竟不能有參與的機會。故欲使人人有平均的體育興趣，除學校設施體育之目的須修正外，其所采行的體育方式亦須因時制宜，例如不能有廣大塲所時或不能有相當設備時，亟宜改行普遍的徒手體操或簡單的器械運動，使人人有參加的機會，則運動旣本諸天性，又能時時習行，換言之，即於自然之外，更增習慣，其興趣自能增進與長久保存也。</p>
<p>藝術包括雕刻繪畫音樂等而言，其興趣更出自天賦。試看嬰兒之聽歌聲而催睡，與觀紅紫而展笑；又試看蠻族之能製作粗模的雕刻圖畫與樂器，皆可爲天賦之明證。藝術不僅可以陶冶性情，並能使人之心神超脫現實。凡對藝術有素養者，風不致感覺餘暇的枯燥；其素養特深者，因能作超脫現實的想像，往往有泰山崩於前而色不變之概。又除藝術之本身效用外，更以藝術之訓練需要忽耐鎭靜種種的特性，此種特性內此種訓練而養成後，畢生處事或消閒均將受其影響。我國中小學校課程中，藝術科目雖亦視同必修，然實際上或因敎師之缺乏，或因側重其他功課，大都有名無實。又以一般學校之升學考試無有注意及此者；於是學校因其設備較難，學生因其無關升學，家長因其不切現實需要；大率漠然視之。今後改進之法，首須大量造就師資，俾有施敎之人；决則規定升學考試時當與其他必修科目一律舉行；庶與其他必修科目發生同等之效用也。</p>
<p>以上三種興趣，皆可於在學時期養成，亦惟有彼時始能養成。三者具備，固大佳；吾則僅具其中一二種之興趣，除於處事治學均甚有益外，則對於餘暇之消遣將不患無適當途徑，而因餘暇所染之種種不良習慣皆可避免矣。國人之奢侈程度，每隨其所受敎育之程度而高下；敎育程度愈高者，奢侈程度亦愈高：於是持論較激者至謂爲享用式的敎育；其實此非敎育一部分之過也，特側重一部分之敎育而忽略他部分之敎育，故所受敎育之程度愈高，對於享用之方法認識愈多。父因職位愈高，每日工作之時間愈短，餘暇之時間愈長；而前此所受之敎育旣未及善用餘暇之方法；於是新式的與奢侈的亭用與娛樂得以承隙支配之，致有本文前段所述之弊耳</p>

<h3>統制外滙成功後　不當需要申請减少　頭寸豐富通貨基礎益臻鞏固　統制目的為自衛及穩固幣制</h3>
<p>國府統制外匯後、採用定貨核准制、及特准私人匯款、自實行以來、不正當之外匯需要、因之减少、爲數殊鉅、同時對外匯之供給方面、因採售結外匯辦法、售得之外匯、由中交二行集中管理、外匯來源豐富通貨基礎鞏固、錄詳情如下、</p>
<p>定統制後　申請減少</p>
<p>爲維護正當商人之　益、作進一步之統制起見、頒佈實行定貨經制、對於二十七年一月一日以後裝運之進口貨、除政府核准執有證明書、得申請外滙外、其餘不論何種物品、概行拒絕接受申請、此項辦法實行後、各行之申請額、較前逐漸减少、如七月四日至九日、申請一·一六七·八〇〇鎊、核准八一·〇〇〇鎊、八月一日至六日、申請一·五四四·八〇〇〇鎊、核准三二·六四六鎊、九月十一日至十七日、申請九五五·五九〇鎊、核准一八·一四四鎊、</p>
<p>特准私人　匯款申請</p>
<p>特准私人滙款、分爲二類、（一）爲滙寄留學生費用、（二）爲滙寄家用、留學生滙款辦法、悉照院令辦法、惟限制極嚴、申請者必須有敎育部之證明、滙寄家用、必須塡具個人需用外滙證明書、註明用途數目等、中央銀行於寨核時、得限制其申請數額、酌予核准、對於私人需要外滙之申請、每月祇能申請一决、其期間爲每月第二星期、</p>

<p>統制外滙、今已告成功、使華北「聯合準備銀行」圖換法幣套取外滙計劃失敗、實行之後、中國對外貿易轉好、入超數量、逐漸减少、使本國工業漸趨發展、不正當之外滙需要因之銳减、採用售結外滙辦法後、外匯頭寸來源豐富、通貨基礎、益臻鞏固、故中國實行統制、乃完全爲自衛計、及爲穩固幣制計、决非頭寸有枯竭之象徵、此希望國人應有之認識也、</p>
<h3>滬杭滙兌　增加匯額　可匯百五十元</h3>

<h3>日軍閥窮兵武　海空軍損失重大　飛機一五〇三架　大小軍艦十九艘</h3>
<p>法文上海日報載稱、據在華北視察之某外人談、日本自一九三七年秋、對華侵略以來、除陸軍方面、有重大損失及傷亡外，在空軍方面、其飛機爲華方所毀滅者、截至一九三八年年底止、共達一千五百零三架、在海軍方面、長江激戰結果、計共沉燬大小軍艦十九艘云、</p>
<h3>遊擊隊日形活躍　內河交通又吿斷絕　日小輸兩艘在靑陽港被截</h3>
<p>現代社云、華方游擊部隊、最近在靑滬公路一帶、頗爲活躍、並不時向鐵路方面及重要河道、乘日方運輸之際、突然出擊、頗牧奇效、日方屢遭重創、損失不資、疲於奔命、引以爲苦、元旦有日本小輪二艘、拖有民船六艘、滿載軍需糧秣等貨物、行經靑陽港方面、即被大隊游擊軍包圍截擊、日方死傷甚多、所有輪船及裝載貨物、盡遭華軍所獲、僅日商二人連同輪主一名、僅以身免、逃回上海、日方得報後、已於昨日午後、派遣日軍二百名、前往靑滬公路一帶、希圖「兜剿」同時並以內河各錢不寗、故又嚴令民船一律暫停航行、以防遭襲、因此內河交通、咋又全告斷絕、各輪公司所蒙營業損失、影響非淺云云、</p>
<p>內河封鎖</p>
<p>新新社云、內河航權、被日商上海內河輪船公司實施統制、派輪行駛後、但近來江浙各游擊區域之游擊隊、已積極開始活動、航班迭遭扣留或襲擊、行駛甚爲困難、日方爲防止游擊隊活動、將內河實施封鎖、各輪船公司亦因行駛危險、客貨淸淡、紛紛停開、內河航班、已全告停頓、最近數日內、暫無航班開出、</p>
<p>客貨中斷</p>
<p>據內河航業界消息、近來內地游擊隊之活躍、情形如火如荼、內河航班已遭受極大打擊、故內地返滬船隻、因沿途危險、且一部份河道、已告封鎖、被阻在內地之船隻甚衆、允以浙西一帶爲最多、大都均爲貨船、因此往來內地客貨運輸、業已完全停頓、</p>
<p>民航停駛</p>
<p>內河航輪在未完全停頓前、曾因內地情形不靖减班行駛、民船航班即應運而生、各綫先後，均由民船往來行駛、但近來因內地河道封鎖、亦被迫完全停航、致往來內地交通、日感困難、據航輪公司方面稱、須待情形稍安、河道即可開放、航班亦可恢復、</p>
<p>滬郊停航</p>
<p>上海至滬市近郊北新涇·閔行·葉榭·松江，新埭·汆來廟·靑浦·崑山·角直·等處內河航班、向較他處爲多、各處航班、雖時影饗停航、但近郊仍能勉强維持、惟日來近郊各處、游擊隊活躍異常、不時出擊、致各錢航班、亦告中斷、</p>

<h3>偽「市銀行」組織失敗　日方拒絕投資　業已停止活動</h3>
<p>現代社云、僞「市長」傅筱庵登塲後、爲企圖統制金融起見·即由周文瑞、竺縵卿等、籌備組織僞「上海市銀行」、進行頗爲積極、當在極司非而路中行別墅內、設立辦事處、推定顧棣三爲「行長」、傅品圭等分任「經理」、資本額定一千萬元、收足半數後、即行開業、茲悉此項企圖積數月之籌備、業已宣告失敗、最初醖釀時、日方曾允投資二百五十萬兀、旋忽食言、迄今未以分文協助、致「市銀行」進行大受影響、「僞府」經費、本甚支絀、毫無餘款可撥「僞市長」遂又異想天開、因以前「大道市府督辦公署」曾移交來稅款一百萬兀、移存日本正金銀行、迄未動用、故向日方要求准許提取此項存款、移充組織僞「市銀行、資金之用、不料又遭日方嚴詞拒絕、不許挪移分文、於是偽「市銀行」企圖、至此已宣告全部失敗、無法籌備進行、故近日該辦事處、業巳陷於停頓狀態中矣、</p>
<h3>民眾慰勞團第二批　即將出發　慰勞華南前錢將士</h3>

<h3>元旦清晨南京路上　日軍武裝巡邏</h3>
<p>元旦侵晨、老閘捕房接報、有日軍巡邏隊三名、各持手槍、行於南京路、據某外人報告該捕房、晨三時三十分、曾目覩日巡邏兵三名、行於南京路山西路交叉處、捕房急派偵探前往調查、至則已不知去向、惟並未發生不幸事件、</p>
<h3>滬市四郊　情形蕭條　浦江交通恢復　浦南仍告封鎖</h3>
<p>國歷新年中、滬市叫郊情形轉緊、各區戒備加嚴、水陸交通大半停頓、浦江東西交通昨日已告恢復、浦西各渡輪停航、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>四郊</p>
<p>滬市四郊、連日以來、散佈在四郊之游擊部隊、復告活躍、尤以浦南滬西各區爲盛、目不時出動襲擊、故各區已加緊戒備、並提早戒嚴時間、居民惴惴不安、僉深居簡出、一至下午五時後、行人絕跡、情形頗爲蕭條、</p>
<p>浦江</p>
<p>浦江東西交通因國曆元旦日各渡口均被封鎖、完全停頓後、昨日已告開放、東溝高橋高廟三渡口、照常行駛、甫黃浦面南碼頭周家渡渡輪、亦同時恢復、往來渡客、因封鎖一日頗爲擁擠、</p>
<p>浦南</p>
<p>浦南情形、因散佈在該處游擊隊頗爲活躍、形勢頗緊、所有得勝港·楊思橋·王家渡·杜家行·閘港·關港·塘口·蘆灘廟等各渡口、均完全封鎖、往來渡客渡浦、祗得由浦東繞道、惟沿途檢查甚爲嚴密、</p>
<p>滬西</p>
<p>目下往來租界與滬西間之交通、陸路祗有虹橋大西路可通行、水路祗有北新涇直達渡輪、往來行駛、近以該處情形不安、北新涇與租界渡輪已告停駛外、陸路要口亦已加緊戒備、檢查甚嚴、故往來行人甚少、滬西與南市各交通耍口、亦均封鎖、禁止行人通行云、</p>
<h3>海門啓東南通　戰事已停　外商輪船今日開航</h3>
<p>日方爲攫奪沿江口一帶稅收、於去年底輕師動衆、以海陸空兵力壓迫蘇北之海門啟東華軍、雙方遂起劇烈鏖戰、經華軍奮勇迎擊，日受重創後、仍退南通及三廠扼守、各外商輪已恢復開航、惟貨運銳减、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>日軍撤退</p>
<p>日僞軍警五六千人、於去年十二月二十二日開始向蘇北海門啟東進犯、當時華軍因受日方五路進攻、重重壓迫、爲保全實力計、紛向內地退守、有若干部隊之華軍、犧牲頗大、後經第二十四集團軍第四游擊區第五旅第九第十兩團丁顏兩部精銳部隊、奮勇迎擊後、日軍損失甚鉅、故仍退回南通城內及靑龍港大生三廠等處扼守、此决日軍耗損大軍彈藥、而一無所獲、途窮匕見、徒然心勞日拙耳、</p>
<p>戰事敉平</p>
<p>海門之日偽軍、自退守三廠後、已深牖禁錮、四週加築工事、恐防華軍之襲擊、不敢出外紛擾、現蘇北戰事可暫告敉平、沿江之宋季港·牛港·豎積港·老洪港·新港·靈甸港·及啟東之三和港東一號等口、仍歸華軍駐防、惟入晚則戒嚴較密、日間隱伏村野、地方秩序安定、如外商輪船、均定於一月三日照常開航、惟客貨方面、恐短期內當不易恢復、</p>
<h3>游擊隊　截擊華漕日兵　擊斃日兵二名　奪獲步槍三支</h3>
<p>滬西虹橋路飛機塲一帶、游擊隊近來異常活躍、前日上午、由姚大隊長督率游擊隊三十餘名、至諸翟鎭巡查、路經華漕鎭、突遇駐鎭日兵、被游擊隊截擊、一時槍聲大作、彈如雨下、鄉民驚慌萬狀、紛紛躱避、歷二時許、日兵不支潰退、計斃日兵二名、獲三八式步槍二支、聞游擊隊亦有數名受傷、</p>
<h3>浦東游擊隊　加强政治工作</h3>
<p>浦東奉南川一二縣游擊區、自上月日軍大隊進犯、發生激烈戰事後、因華軍利用地勢、引敵深入、故奉南縣城、一度被日軍佔據、旋因華方以游擊戰略晝夜困擾、日軍不敢留戀、急促退回原防地、即川沙方面退至川沙縣城、南匯方面、退至周浦、奉賢方面完全放棄、三縣境內又爲華軍恢復十二日·十三日·以前之情勢，惟經此戰役、日軍之能力、已經明瞭、而此後抗戰方法、亦當酌量改變、抓住彼方弱點、（即各個擊破之戰術、以少數兵力集中攻擊某一游擊隊據點、）從事自我改善、對於配備方面、編制方面、及思想方面、行動方面、均有顯著之變動、務期此後作戰、由數方面同時發動、分散日軍兵力、並在水道中施行緊急封鎖之法、使日方汽艇無法活動、對於地方上之行政方面、亦將厲行不擾民原則、歸縣府直接管轄軍隊餉糈、由縣府直接撥給、一方面加緊剷奸工作、使日軍喪失眼綫、陷於盲目行動之境、故未來之大浦東、將展開一新局面云、</p>
<h3>傀儡勾結日人　結黨營私　所謂顧問班　亦共分兩派</h3>
<p>偽「市府」日指導員班長西村、及指導員甲斐小島等三人、因舞弊鉅量烟土案、被日方撤職查辦、另一指導員藥袋、亦因有盜賣棧房貨物嫌疑而被捕、故西村指導班受不名譽事件之影響、而成瓦解、僞「市長」傅筱庵爲便利獨斷營私起見、乘機希圖解除束縛、懇求僞「行政院長」梁鴻志、商請日方取消指導員制度、但爲日方拒絕、惟磋商結果、將指導名稱、改爲顧問、另委石井與西田兩日人、着手將「指導班」改組爲「顧問班」、石井爲傅筱庵接近人物、充當僞「市府」首席顧問、西田爲蘚錫文接近者、充當僞「市府」顧問、因此顧問班中又分成傅蘇兩派、其他各僞「局」顧問，亦將在此兩派中產生、故此後偽「府」辦事、形成兩派對峙、互相取監視態度、與前指導班時代性質不同、日僞辦事之不統一、於此可見一斑、惟傅蘇兩人、此後在背景不同之情形下、辦理偽「政」更難趨於合作之一途、故衝突之事件、將必較前更多、</p>
<h3>接近戰區各工廠　國府令飭登記內遷　無力遷移者可代籌運費　由經濟部出資協助生產</h3>
<p>國府爲適應抗戰需要、除獎勵各國貨工廠、儘量生產國貨外、並飭令各省地方政府協助工廠內遷、以便扶植、而利發展、現悉自前年抗戰迄今、東南各省因戰事關係國軍西撤後、所有淪陷區域各工廠、或移滬租界開工、或遷至內地者、爲數的數百家、當時因限於環境不能遷移者、亦不在少數、政府有鑒於此、最近再令飭接近戰區之各地工廠、由各該省政府積極辦理登記、設法內遷、如工廠本身無力遷移、則由地方政府代籌運費、或估價收買、再將機件運至內地、政府當局並爲切實扶助工商業之發展、對於規模較小之內遷工廠、决由經濟部或各省建設廳出資加入、俾振興工業、增加生產、已訂定辦法、通令各省遵照、</p>
<h3>冬令內港水位低落　內地運滬米糧减少　每日各輪裝滬僅五千餘包　滬存米充足民食可吿無慮</h3>
<p>入冬以來、內港水位低落、航運困難、故近日內地運滬米糧减少、每日僅五千餘包、滬市存米達六十餘萬包、足敷三四月民食之維持、米價平穩、人心安定米糧存棧問題、銀錢業妥籌辦法、儘量儲存、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>來源減少</p>
<p>平常於冬令時期、汎潮已歛、江河水位低落、但年來因戰事之後、內地各港支流河沼、未曾疏濬、故泥床增加、致儎重帆船行駛困難、長江水位亦减退、其噸數較鉅之輪船、不易靠近口岸、因此種種原因、近日到滬米糧甚稀、現每晚由各口岸及內河方面拖運來滬之米糧僅五千餘包、與一二日前比較、相差的一半以上、</p>
<p>民食無慮</p>
<p>現代社記者調查本市存米總數、計達六十三四萬包、以該批米糧、支配全市民食、估計可維持三四個月、滬市米價、自國歷年底收盤止、已呈平穩狀態、最高白粳、每石售十二元二三角、中次號約十元四五角至十一元一二角間、至於米糧出口、除日方偷運的計十餘萬包外、（該項米糧均由內地採辦運去）滬米轉口者爲數尚屬有限云、</p>
<p>租屋儲米</p>
<p>關於滬米存棧前因棧房缺少、不敷儲存、故米商方面積極向租界當局及關係團體商協、現悉銀錢業將原有各棧儘量儲堆國米、且其棧費方面亦特別優待、同時米商亦自行設法、租賃餘屋堆存、故後來內地之河米、對存棧問題已獲解决辦法、如再不敷應用、租界當局當協助妥籌補救云、</p>
<h3>波蘭肉食出口　銷售英國最廣</h3>

<h3>一年來觀感及對時局感想</h3>
<p>— 謝晋元</p>
<p>流光似水，中華民國二十八年，瞬忽屆臨，余因精神不寧，入院療養，遵醫囑，除去一切煩雜，至輿論界同人，要求爲文陳述一年來之觀感，一時無以承命，最近孤島同胞，因在精衛氏之出亡，謠言頻繁，紛紛詢問眞相，及將來之趨勢，余對抗戰前途，始終樂觀，余以往曾言我國軍事，有絕對勝利把握，如有問題，即在政治耳，但政治問題，亦非無可挽救，蓋以吾國人口衆多，空間廣大，經過持久之抗戰，必能使一切政治問題，隨軍事之發展，而上軌道，尤以我國今日之軍人，受我最高領袖大無畏精神之感召，與夫民族國家至上之革命敎化，使現代軍人之思想，殆有一日千里之勢，至於在氏過去，在黨國僅負一部份責任，寧漢分裂之言論行動，與夫擴大會議之舉措，證以今日之出亡，所影響於抗戰建國之大業，充其量，不過淆亂視聽，予仇者以挑撥造謠之機會而已。</p>
<p>余認爲在氏爲一理想的空言家，缺乏堅强一貫之革命信念，鑑其以往革命歷史，或不至自棄國人，與漢奸爲伍，允以國家到此關頭，决非一二通電或長篇大論之演說，有所裨益，在氏此舉，足以暴露國內少數動搖份子之沒落命運，使國內團結禦侮之基礎益趨堅强，余本有「抗戰期中，國民應有之認識，」一文，在元旦發表，因病阻未果，要而言之，處茲大時代之國民，應具有絕對理智之冷靜頭腦，以把握信念，認淸是非，苟神經過敏，忽視現實，徒然陷以往國人輕浮虛躁，徒託空言之大病，允望言論界努力負起主導責任，對於一切撲朔迷離不盡不實之消息，不必過於標榜，而動國人對抗戰之信心，夫此决之全面抗戰，原爲政府之一貫政策，遠在五年前，即有詳確計劃，故在氏任何言論行動，絕不足影響抗戰國策，此不過抗戰過程中，賢奸智愚之明確分野而已，今日吾人務必認淸，唯有誓死擁護蔣委員長，抗戰必獲最後勝利，蔣委員長爲繼往開來發揚光大，我國五千年歷史文化之唯一偉人，爲復興民族奠定國家千秋萬世基業之領袖，國民必須認淸國家民族之靈魂，實繫於蔣委員長，蔣委員長之靈魂，亦即吾國家民族之靈魂，今後國人唯有本「國家興亡，匹夫有責，」之義，各守崗位，竭盡天職，以最高領袖之主張爲主張，意志爲意志，而脚踏實地，努力報國，孤島之同胞乎，際茲一年之開始，願人人檢討抗戰一年半以來所盡責任若何，當茲數百萬前錢將士，出生入死，數千萬戰區同胞，流離顚沛之日，孤島同胞，是吾可以藉特殊環境，而隔岸看火，余留於孤島，謹以至誠呼籲於孤島同胞，民國二十八年，必爲吾國抗戰建國之年，深盼孤島同胞，人人加緊報效祖國之責任，有錢出錢，有力出力，以完成全民動員之基礎，允以一元還債運動，更爲一個國民應盡之天職，務於推行普遍，廣及老幼，則集腑成裘，聚沙成塔，四萬萬五千萬人力量之結合，必成堅固之長城，抗戰前途，必勝可期，否則國破家亡，恐爲猶太人第二，恐亦不可得矣，新歲初臨，深望同胞勉之，</p>

<h3>「半刁子」</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>「半刁子」是「帮口」中的術語，是那班「反覆無常」朋友的代名詞，所以也是一種侮辱的稱呼。</p>
<p>「半刁子」的心理，的行爲，的言論，是無法捉摸的。他有時會很勇敢，很奮進，有時却會很畏葸，很卑怯；他有時會慷慨就義，有時却會靦顏事仇；他有時會侃侃然仗義執言，有時却會呶呶然抹殺眞理。總之，他是沒有骨氣的，沒有靈魂的，沒有正義感的，他是風中的弱柳，水上的浮萍，祇知隨勢逐波的。</p>
<p>「帮口」中要的是「三刀六洞」的忠義的鬥士，所以對於那班「反覆無常」的「帮友」，便給以「半刁子」的雅號，以便一般」帮友」的識別，而予以相當的制裁。</p>
<p>「半刁子」因爲心理的可恥，行爲的下賤，言論的出爾反爾，所以會給一般「帮友」瞧不起，但是爲了生存，他不得不在生活技巧方面用功夫，而狡詐，險惡，狠毒，便是他的特長；他非特會以狡滑的手段來詐取朋友的財物，也會在他的自私自利情感下，出賣他的朋友，出賣他的「老頭子」的。因此「半刁子」不僅可恥，抑且可殺！</p>
<p>「帮口中有「半刁子」，一般社會中也有「半刁子」；而且「半刁子」自古已有，不過於今爲烈而已。秦檜的貪戾利祿，竟挾金人以自重；吳三桂的爲了愛妾陳圓圓，竟引淸兵入關；和目下一班「滑稽」朋友，傀儡登台，這都是民族國家的「半刁子」，至於市檜以下，「半刁子」則更多如牛毛，俯拾即是，祗有程度的高低，頭寸的大小之差別耳。</p>
<p>不過，「半刁子」雖屬狡詐，險惡，狠毒，能够欺朦一時，生活優遊，然而遇見了「正氣」，「綱常」，他只有死減。所以現在世風日下，一般人都想做「半刁子」，但都不樂做「半刁子」。假使是有人氣的，有歷史的，有相當功績的，或者有相當地位的，那就雖想做，而也不敢自暴自棄去做那「半刁子」了。</p>
<p>然而事實也有例外，有歷史的有功績的，現在也想開始走入「半刁子」的途徑了！嗚呼！「半刁子」不死，天地間將無正氣！</p>
<h3>迎着勝利的曙光前進</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>大除夕的晚上，「孤島」上的人們都鼓着聖誕的餘勇，在狂瘋的舞塲中度過一九三八年的最後一天。</p>
<p>在「孤島」上過新年，巳是第二决了。第一個新年剛在國軍西撤，首都陷落的時候，上海正恰如新加的尊號一樣，一切都像「孤島」那樣冷落，蕭條。這一個新年，情形顯然是不同了，在熱，喧閙，並不遜色於抗戰之前。</p>
<p>這說明「孤島」上的人士已經完全忘去了他們的祖國了嗎？自然不能吾認有一部份的人們已麻醉在目前的環境中了；但，决不是全體的。</p>
<p>在瘋狂的跳着最流行的「萊姍勃舞步的時候，全舞塲的燈光突然發出强有力的光輝，遠處正敲着嘹亮的鐘聲，—十二鐘，令體樂師嚴肅地站了起來，奏着一支每倘人都熟稔的音樂，於是舞客，舞女，被這音樂驚醒過米，不由自主地唱出「三民主義，吾黨所宗」的歌聲來，在一秒鐘前是脂粉和香汗混成的舞塲，現在宛如莊嚴的聖地，每一顆赤子之心，每一滴沸騰的血，彷彿脫離了他們的軀殻，而飛到遙遠的世界去了。—在那個世界裹，我們的同胞正以頭顫詳血和敵人搏鬥，爲了爭取我們民族的生存！</p>
<p>除了喪心病在的漢奸，才徘徊於「和平之門」！哀莫大於心死，但「孤島」人心並沒有死滅！</p>
<p>所以，在這新年的開始，每個人更應該時時提醒自己，站定脚跟，盡每一份棉薄的力量。一年中積壓着的疲勞，已取償於這三天的休息了，從今天起，就該奮起精神來做每一個國民應做的工作，至少應堅持着節的救難的信條，不使寳貴的錢財和健全的精神虛投在無益的塲所。</p>
<p>迎着勝利的曙光前進，達到那邊的時候才是我們狂歡作樂的日子！</p>

<h3>鳳侶鸞儔</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>The　Girl　of　The　Golden　West　米高美出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>自從「鳳凰于飛」，「桃花恨」之後，珍妮麥唐納和奈爾遜埃第的分手，使他們的觀衆有不勝依依之感。「鳳侶鸞儔」能够再度合作，而且作爲新年的默映，在「呌座」力上，自然是毫無問題的。但是我們更該記起去年也在南京開映的「戰地笙歌」（珍妮麥唐納及亞倫瓊斯合演的），它不但劇本的有眞實性，益以導演的那種卓越，潑剌，一氣呵成的手法，「鳳侶鸞儔」對之，是不免遜色的。</p>
<p>「鳳侶鸞儔」的本事是一部新裝的西部片，而且宗敎意味太濃厚。「矯勇豪俠，劫富濟貧」的劇盜雷麥里斯（奈爾遜埃第）的一懺悔前非，棄邪歸正，及地方官倫斯知曼麗（珍妮麥唐納）與雷麥里斯相愛之誠，而「毅然引退，玉成好事」，即使宗敎眞有感化的力量，那末，這感化的力量也是不够的。</p>
<p>導演Robert　Z.　Leonard處理個別的塲面是相當有魄力的，但是整個的戲，在聯系上似乎不够緊凑，在開始的時候，使人感到非常沉悶，這大半也是故事瑣碎，而時問和空間不能適當調正的關係。</p>
<p>奈爾遜埃第似乎是不大適宜的演這一類角色的，高騎闊帽，在好萊塢彷彿已經有了定型的人物，這也是「鳳侶鸞儔「最大的損失。但是對於西部人民那種粗野而可愛的性格，及濃郁的地方色彩，導演還是成功的。</p>
<p>如曼麗參加在歡節的那塲戲，從雷麥里攔刧了軍官服裝，冒稱約翰中尉，趕來赴會起，那瘋狂的西班牙舞，及埃第嘹亮的歌聲，那塲戲的空氣緊凑極了。塲面之偉大，鏡頭之活躍，尤是餘事。曼麗在敎堂歌唱，那活潑的鏡頭，也是不可多見的。</p>
<p>最使人感動的是下面的幾塲戲。曼麗誕辰，地方官倫斯送他一架鋼琴，老敎授奏琴，曼麗高歌，衆人的和唱，而倫斯也流露着衷心的喻快；及後曼麗答允嫁給倫斯，在赴敎堂結婚之前，仍由老敎授奏琴，然而她已嗚咽不能成聲，在對照之下，導演是緊緊地控制着當時的情緒的。</p>
<p>雷麥里斯曼麗約，赴木屋共膳的那塲也是如此。在雷麥里斯中槍受傷之後，倫斯追踪而來，曼麗把他藏在擱樓上，但是當他們握手的時候，樓上的血漬剛滴在他的手上。及後用賭博來决定嫁娶，又被發現作弊，終於以釋放雷麥里斯爲條件而嫁給倫斯。在「愛與死的搏鬥」過程中不但導演手腕的超越，珍妮麥唐納在不能「兩全」的心理衝突上，也是演得非常好的。</p>
<h3>上海掌故譚</h3>
<p>— 沆齊主</p>
<p>女彈調（五）</p>
<p>走筆至此，因憶及在「竹枝詞」中，亦多寫女彈詞者。如邦江詞客「上海竹枝詞」云：「說唱彈詞號女先，姑蘇新到小嬋娟。琵琶半抱佯遮面，含笑低頭學簸錢。」足證彈詞女，在初期雖常熟爲多，往後則姑蘇各地，亦有習者。</p>
<p>雲栖居士「洋塲本事詩，」其彈詞」一篇云：「登壇天女譜宮商，絕妙無遮會一塲。到耳笙歌齊按曲，銷魂羅綺暗生香。嚴妝華燭分明是，檀板金尊子細將。已極人間幽艷事，從今不羨舞霓裳。」此與申江舊主「申江三十好」之一所云：「申江好，書館姓名標。屏却鬚眉重巾幗，只談弦索不笙簫，暮暮又朝朝。及「上海南北竹枝訶」中所云：「彈詞少女好容顏，漫轉檀槽露指環。最是有情佯笑處，輕搖畫扇整雲　。」均足說明所謂「女彈詞」對於其本身之認識，與夫聽衆之了解，兩者大多非爲說書及聽書而來。</p>
<p>「上海南北竹枝詞」又云：「一曲琵琶四座傾，佳人也是號先生，就中誰是超羣者，吳素卿同黃愛卿。」以及「敬亭餘緒足軒渠，難得明朝說會書。袁調自高嚴調穩，若論風貌讓三朱。」並註云：「說書女先生，首推袁雲仙，嚴麗貞。三朱者素蘭，素卿，幼香也。」且足補充持平叟「接女彈詞小志」之闕。人物評詩，此册所載最多，書刊於光緒二年（一八七六），作者與持平叟大的同時。評詩云：</p>
<p>王麗娟—天公疊降掌書仙，領袖應推王麗娟。一種風流高格調，移情奚必讓成連。</p>
<p>袁雲仙—書塲鬨鬧夕陽犬，館主堂官共脅肩。報到先生油璧至，人人靑眼看雲仙。</p>
<p>朱幼香—爛漫天眞朱幼香，琵琶小撥韻琅琅。嬌憨亦有倚人意，好是矜持阿母旁。</p>
<p>王幼娟—幼娟絕世聰明甚，淺笑輕顰更可憐。弱質何堪太消瘦，亭亭莫使立風前。</p>
<p>嚴麗貞—老輩風流嚴麗貞，登塲一盼似多情。倭袍葷素人爭聽，弦索聲中字字淸。</p>
<p>陳月娥—可是蟾宮謫素娥，塵寰游戲記嬌歌。氷弦彈向溶溶月，凄切聲中別恨多。</p>
<p>朱素蘭—素蘭京調也堪誇，淸歌悠揚蝶戀化。更有洋琴推獨步，聲聲歌出浪淘沙。</p>
<p>徐雅雲—鳳目蛾眉徐雅雲，亭亭如鶴立鷄羣。吳娘暮雨蕭蕭曲，重到江甫再一聞。</p>
<p>錢雅鄉—常筵按拍助傾觴，嚦嚦鶯聲繞畫梁。偏是雅卿歌雅調，琵琶誤撥引周郞。</p>
<p>徐實玉—宛轉歌喉一曲新，徐娘半老尚風塵。書樓浪說逢靑睞，誰識當年碧玉身。</p>
<p>施月蘭—嫻雅端嚴讓月蘭，大家風範坐書壇。陽春一曲爭傾耳，莫作尋常一例看。</p>
<p>陳愛卿—漫撥檀槽便有情，奇音別出斷腸聲。何人偏喜巴人唱，知吾書塲有愛卿。</p>

<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓</p>
<p>他把這兩决的農忙假，代替了城裹那些學校的暑假寒假，可是他在城裹學校放暑假放寒假的當兒，他却並不放假。那末當人家農忙的時候，他怎麼樣呢？他也是個鄉下人，難道一點田地也沒有嗎？怎麼沒有？他們弟兄兩人，有自田二十多畝咧，因爲他的哥哥故世了，他把田讓給兩個姪兒種了。要實在忙不過來的常兒，他來帮帮忙，指揮指揮，也就够了。此外光陰，他還是在小茶館裹多，放了農忙假，更加盤桓在那裹了。但他在小茶館裹，也有許多事：一則是代人家讀信寫信，因爲那時候，鄉下人很多不認得字的，尤其是鄉下婦女。阿大的娘，在蘇州帮傭；阿二的爺，在上海做工，來了書信，總是要拿到小茶館裹，請先生讀給他們聽。回頭又請先生寫回信，那他常常就當這個差使，他的白話信，比城裹的那些測字先生的，要通順明白得多咧。他也不要什麼報酬，可是鄉下人自然的採了南瓜，揀大的送他一個；燒了菜飯，盛兩碗送他去吃，第二件，他在小茶館裏，常能講新聞給大衆聽，因爲村裹有個朋友，在城裹一家布廠裹當夥計。那家布廠，是看一份申報的，看過了就丟掉。他却想法子，貼他幾個錢寄費，把看過的申報寄到鄉下來。雖然日子已經過了三四天了，在鄉下却還是新鮮，終究是個新聞。有許多抱下喲小茶館裹，別的沒有什麼，空下來，總是叉麻雀。二百剷三百剷，儘管剷下去。甚而至於因爲輸了錢，打架起來，茶壺與板凳齊飛。然而他那裹的小茶館，倒還沒有那種風氣，有許多坐茶館的人，不過大家談論談論。或者講點什麼故事，不脫那種瓜棚閒括的風趣。大家也纏着這位鄉下先生，講點報上所登載的新聞給他們聽。現在政府裹是什麼人常權咧，近來縣長又換了一個什麼人咧，今年租米的折價是要多少錢一石咧。一個小茶館裹，倒也討論起國家大事，地方行政來，不要瞧它小小一份報紙，在鄉下人中間，可以增加不少知識呢。　（三）</p>

<h3>日紗廠所受津花統制苦痛</h3>
<p>— 徵五</p>
<p>在去年的歲未，本市的外棉交易，有了一個新的展開，即近來上海的各日廠商，均大量進購美棉及巴西棉。這一種反常的狀態，頗引起了棉業界的重視。蓋日本政府自厲行强力的經濟統制政策以來，嚴格限制人民採購歐美原料；而今上海方面的各日廠商，竟訂購大批外棉，以供紡織之用。這種反常現象之構成，其原因决非單純的基之於外棉跌價；其實際的因素，乃是環境種種所驅迫而造成的。</p>
<p>蓋自戰事爆發以來，日本爲欲設法使其本國戰時財政加强，擬打開經濟貿易的新出路，伸運用其一貫之政策，以武力與經濟，雙管齊下來控制我游擊區內的一切貿易，以期扶助日商在日軍暫時占領區內各項事業之發展。尤其是棉紡業，它利用了僞組織的僞鈔，以及日本軍務部所發行的軍用票，在日本各暫領區中儘量的設法吸收法幣，而復以法幣換購各　區的棉產，以供各日紗廠之消耗。所以上海的各日紗廠，自戰後復工以來，其所用之原棉，大宗是抑給於來自華北一帶的棉產。</p>
<p>但近時天津棉因了需要的加增，價格日形提高，且滬津間的匯水，亦因華北需要法幣而高漲。且另一方面，日本當局爲欲使華北聯合準備銀行僞幣信用之加强，於是極力的將華北各地所流通的法幣，强制貶價。政法幣每百兀等値華北聯合準備銀行僞幣八十元，於此種情况下，同樣的，亦無異是使華北棉價提高，以致天津棉因價格的懸殊，運滬數量爲之銳减。而自十二月一日起，日軍部授令北平「臨時政府，嚴禁棉花出口，並行使棉價統制，於是各日廠商對於原棉的供給方面，均感缺乏之苦，在此無法應付的情形下，於是他們也就祗得採購外棉來替代原料上的急需。</p>
<p>自戰事開始以來，日本國內因製造軍火，所需棉量殊巨，而其本國經濟力量薄弱，實無巨額黃金可供輸出，以易國外原棉之用，所以日本唯一辦法，使是在中國的游擊區域內採收棉收，以運回日本，供國內之消耗，故日政府當局爲欲限價收購各該區之棉產，利用「臨時政府一名義，實行統制，華北棉產因不能外運，故棉價猛跌，日政府即乘機貶價，將全部華北棉產，除當地消耗外，悉數運日，這確是給與本市日商紗廠原料上的重大打擊。據統計在過去的三月中，華棉之被運往日本者，已達一百五十萬担之多，然事實上，此數尚未包括自十二月一起，嚴禁棉花出口頒佈以後之輸日數字。然日本所需之棉額，與此數相差仍遠殊，故日本希望在各游擊區內，不斷的儘量吸購，以滿足國內的需要而後已。</p>
<p>唯敷月來，華北一帶產棉之運往各地者，因由於各地布匹貿易轉佳，各紗廠復工及添置新錠，日形加增，而產棉區域，却因戰局關係較形縮少，在此求過於供之狀態下，於是棉價高漲，此時之日本所期以低價吸購華棉之計劃上，發生了很大的阻碍。因之禁止出口，使所有的棉花，屯積在各區域內，任其自行跌價，日本即能盡其所欲，將低價的棉花，收購運往日本，關於此種手段，是吾能獲得功効，吾等雖難能斷定，然而目下上海的各日商紗廠，却因了這棉產統制的實行，在原棉的供給上，起了更度的恐慌。</p>
<p>由於上述的原因，上海的各日商紗廠，爲了原棉來源被絕，除了採購美棉巴西棉及印棉以補救外，簡直是沒有其他辦法了。</p>
<p>其决，各日紗廠在目前發生原料供給缺乏的現象，更足以表顯出各日廠在資金上的奇緊。蓋依一般的情形來說，任何一家紗廠，依例對於原棉的貯臧至少均備有可供三至六月的需要準備，由是說來，則雖遇有此一時的原料缺乏，亦絕不致發生若何問題，儘可將貯棉應用，以待日後收購來補充。然事實上，各日商紗廠，因了本國政府爲籌措國家作戰經費之需，迭决重徵「愛國稅」，所以他們在營業上雖是呈顯着盈餘的狀態，而在流通資金上，大都呈着困難的現象，僅能隨時的採購原料，隨時以供紡織之用，根本沒有巨量的資金，來購棉貯藏，故在此時也就不得不進購外棉來作爲唯一的補救法了。</p>
<p>綜上的一般趨勢，在此華北來源中斷之特殊狀態下，日後外棉的運滬，勢必逐日加增</p>
<h3>英美商約與英美坎之貿易關係</h3>
<p>坎拿大皇家銀行（TheRoyal　Bank　of　Canada）十二月期報告云，新近宜佈之美坎商的及英美商的，實可令人想見彼此商業關係之重大，美國與坎拿大初於一九三五年十一月間，訂有商的，於翌年一月一日施行，期訂三年，在此三年中，兩國商業頗受刺激，舊的期滿，更訂新的，該新的之訂立，足使兩國商務益臻發達，可預期也。</p>
<p>根據美國官方統計，一九三五年坎拿大對美輸出，爲二八六百萬美元，對美輸入爲三二三百萬美元，故美之出超爲三七百萬美元，一九三六年，即美坎商的施行之第一年，坎拿大出口貿易增加至三七六百萬美元，蓋是年美國旱荒爲災，致使坎麥，牲畜，及其他農產品，輸美激增，尚有木材等工業用品，輸出亦見大增，允以英屬哥倫比亞爲甚，同時美對坎輸出，亦見增進，惟爲數不鉅，是年輸坎總額，爲美金三八四百萬美元，故兩國輸出額，幾乎相等，相差僅爲美金八百萬元，翌年一九三七年，美對坎輸出，較上年爲大增，總數達五一〇百萬美元，計增加一二六百萬元，坎拿大之輸出則爲三九九百萬元，計增加二三百萬元，是年美對坎出超爲一一一百萬兀，此在上年則僅八百萬元耳，厥後美國商業衰落，復因農產豐收，遂使坎貨輸美，一落千丈，是項趨勢，迄於一九三八年猶然，在一九三八年首八月間，坎拿大產品輸美降至一六二百萬元，此在上年同期，則爲二七九百萬元，而另一方面，美貨輸坎，仍維持其良好狀態，計三二三百萬元，此在上年同期，則爲三三六百萬元，是故一九三八年度，美對坎出超，達一六一百萬元。</p>
<p>美坎兩國閒之通商，各佔對外貿易上之重要地位，何則，試觀一九三〇年度，美坎兩國十輸出總額，合計在美金一百萬元以上，其中美坎輸出爲六五九百萬元，而坎對美輸出爲四〇二百萬元，當美國商業衰落之數年間，兩國貿易亦見激减，惟自一九三〇至三八之九年間，兩國輸出總額，的爲六五〇百萬元，其間美對坎輸出爲三七五百萬元，而坎對美輸出爲二七五百萬元，由是觀之，在美國全部對外貿易額量中，坎拿大實居其輸出額之七分之一，而在美國全部出超額言之，對坎單獨出超，的一百萬元，佔全部出超額之四分之一。</p>
<p>其决爲美國對英之貿易，其總額雖不逮對坎貿易之鉅，但自一九三〇至三八年間，每年平均總額，爲美金五六九百萬元，其中美對英輸出爲美金四六百萬元，英對美輸出爲一四一百萬元，美對英輸出最大部份，當推原棉，舉例以明之，一九三七年七月至一九三八年七月之一年中，英國購買美棉價値達八五百萬元，蓋已超過世界任何國家向美購棉數量兩倍以上，（法居第二位爲四〇百萬元）在過去九年問，美對英貿易出超，每年平均爲二八七百萬兀，夫央之爲大量入超國，世固知之矣，但不謂入超數量中，美貨實佔大部份，則恐未爲世人所盡知耳。</p>
<p>上述九年間，美之全部輸出額，每年平均爲三八百萬元，在此數字內，美對坎輸出幾近一〇〇百萬元，而對英輸出則達二八七百萬元，由是言之，九年以來，美對外貿易，年年出超，可謂純由兩國所造成。</p>
<p>雖然就貿易狀况言之，美坎擔負固極重大，但就另一方面言之，美人游歷坎拿大者綦衆，費用浩繁，轉使坎拿大對美收支之平衡，較爲有利，故如將此筆「由遊歷造成之貿易」併算在內，則自一九三一年始，美購坎貨，年較坎購美貨爲夥，同一例也，美國支付英國之輪資，保險費等，爲數亦鉅，故就兩國最後總結論之，英國商業狀况，較之單就出口貿易估計所得者，良好多矣。</p>
<p>近世各國，皆視各該出口貿易之多寡，以定進口數量之增减，故貿易收支平衡，關係特重，苟世界非爲今日之世界，而爲理想的世界，不受關稅政策及其他商業限制之牽掣，則按經濟原理，一國之購貨，必購諸於物價最低之市塲，其售貨也，亦必沽諸於物價最高之市塲，故一國縱有收支之失衡，亦無關於宏旨，何則其他多邊的相互關係，迅可將其罅漏補償，有以使然也，然在國家主義支配商業政策之下，此一問題，遂更顯其嚴重，英帝國每决會議之際，英國各部，均引領欲得本國市塲之更多分配，然阿琴鐵那（Argentina）瑞典那威諸國。皆爲英貨之大量購買者，故英國在支配其帝國各部數量時，對茲數國，亦不容忽視，而英國吸收世界各國出口額，旣如此之大且鉅，故其帝國各部以及其他各國，均已予以重大讓步，俾獲得其對英之優先輸入，是故英苟欲繼續收買美之過剩產品，則他國輸入之限量，必愈益狹隘，殆爲不可避免者焉。</p>
<p>英國向外投資，數額龐大，故英於若干年前，固已認貿易入超，爲屬必須，蓋向外購進貨物，可使他國履行償付其投資應得之利益，由於是項讓步，英國得到借款利益，確較他國爲優，新興國家，資源類多不充，故在商業疲敝之時，負維持世界金融安定之資者，其必資源充裕之諸先進國乎，各國對國際貿易，苟能善意扶植，不加限制，不以人超介於意，任其自由進出，則必能使當前世界困難大爲减少，其結果必可使新興諸國繼續履行淸償債務義務，英國在此期內，始終居於大量入超國地位，而不介意，其大有造於世界商業之復興，功固非淺，然而世界商業之恢復，終必使英國對外貿易同蒙其利，而獲得進步者焉。（A）</p>

<h3>論排泄</h3>
<p>— 丁三</p>
<p>我們出恭，撒尿，淌汗，原是身體內部廢料的排泄。要是道些廢料累積下去，那末它們不但會阻止養料的吸收，並且還會變成毒質，而使整個的身體病弱起來。</p>
<p>身體中的毒質，有時潛伏在內部，而致生了內病；有時發出在外部，而生了外病。醫內病，得通便發汗，醫外病，得割治瘡癤；總之，首先還是靠排泄。</p>
<p>政治社會的機構，有點和個人生理的機構相像，雖然不能機械地看做相同。那裹面也有養料——健全的成份，和廢料——腐敗的成份。要使民族國家强盛，自然得從政治社會的機構裹，不姑息地剷除腐敗的成份，而引用健全的成份。</p>
<p>政治社會機構中的廢料，同樣地會阻止廢料的吸牧；並且任其生長發展下去，結果一定會變成毒質。這些毒質，有時在暗底裹潛伏着，進行其破壞的作用，而使民族國家生了隱病；有時在公開地發出來，進行其潰爛的作用，而使民族國家生了外病。要醫治這種病，必須全國上下有敏銳的警覺性，向那些廢料變成的毒質，作不容情的鬥爭，排除他們，割去他們！</p>
<p>不過，也許有人要問，這樣幹起來，不是要分裂民族國家統一了麼？那末，我也要反問一句：你的出恭，撒尿，淌汗，或者生了瘡癤割除爛肉，不是分裂你的身體的統一了麼？這樣的問題通不通？不通！因爲廢物和毒質不排泄掉，不但不能加强統一，而且倒會破壞統一；排泄廢物和毒質，正是剷除危害統一的成份，以便多多吸收增强統一的成份，而使民族國家更加壯健起來！</p>
<p>所以，一些在政治社會機構中盤據着的腐敗成份，絡續地被肅淸，我們不能認爲是統一的分裂而過慮，倒應認爲是統一的加强而欣喜。</p>
<p>我國這次抗戰，從對內一點上說，正是一决總排泄，也就是所謂總淸算。在抗戰中，把那好幾年來在政治社會機構中所累積的廢料和毒質——割據軍閥，貪官汚吏和漢奸賣國賊，都顯出了原形，而淘汰，剷除；同時把那此堅决抗日，勇敢積極和刻苦耐勞的進步份子，吸收引用；使得吾國的抗日戰統一，因了質的改變而越益堅强起來！</p>
<p>抗戰越緊張，那些廢料和毒質，就越容易曝露，同時也就越容易排泄掉。這决不是壞現象，而正是好現象。肅淸他們，這决不是分裂了統一，而倒是加强了統一。我們非但不能因此悲觀，倒該因此樂觀，並且還應當加緊排泄工作，使我們的抗戰力量更加壯健起來；那才能够爭取抗日建國的最後勝利！</p>
<h3>歡笑了的金家村</h3>
<p>— 徐齊</p>
<p>「啊！這麼多的一羣啊！」小毛媽吊着一桶水拐進門來，牙齒再也關不住她的沙嗓子裹發出來的聲音。</p>
<p>小毛爹並不在，這使她的興奮擊成一陣掃興，一面咕囉着：</p>
<p>「死鬼！到那裹去了呢？老大淸早……」</p>
<p>小毛坐在灶下，灶洞裹還沒生火，但總是那麼煖和的，她低低地唱着：披着顏色麻條，錄一塊，黃一塊地。</p>
<p>「是頭决鷄啼時就到的呢！」阿其嫂口臭的嘴一直對着小毛媽噴來，她賣弄着早知道的光榮。</p>
<p>太陽像個大紅柿，從山後拋到山顚，十一月底的寒霜上敷上了一層金衣，今天，整個的金家村都充滿了活氣與喜悅，連大腹便便的豬也一步一步地踱出來，樣子怪安詳地。</p>
<p>「燒飯飯，做人家，三炊只用一梱柴！」</p>
<p>「小毛！」</p>
<p>小毛跳了起來，抱住媽的腿，媽在她額上輕輕打一下。</p>
<p>「乖乖！媽和你看熱鬧去，啊！這麼多的兵哪！」</p>
<p>「可是黃衣的矮子兵又來了嗎？」小毛一陣子的寒慄。</p>
<p>「小妮子！這回是綠衣兵了，全長得高高的，黃衣兵冉也不敢來了！」</p>
<p>小毛牽着媽的衣　就向外跑，小毛媽拐着脚，要快不能快，小毛急了，用一隻脚蹺着走，還離開媽一丈多。</p>
<p>「哦！這麼多的一羣！」</p>
<p>鄰合們一面嚼着黍餅一面談笑。田塲上，車棚下，全坐着許多日子沒有看見的老鄉們。他們依舊是那麼安靜，和氣與快樂。還有，馬在榆樹下突魯突魯地嗅着泥土，野砲上都</p>
<p>他們與他們就久別重逢地談起來，伙夫用敏捷的手段煮早飯，很滑稽地把滿臉滿手都染黑了，白色的蒸氣一陣陣冒着，和談天的聲浪渾雜了起來</p>
<p>「是從X莊來的呢！」</p>
<p>「X莊！有百來里添！」</p>
<p>「在我們全不算一回事，三四天的路程我們也會一口氣趕的。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>孩子們雜在他們中叫去玩，小毛爬到一個胖得差不多帶不上軍帽的背上去。</p>
<p>「小寳寳！下來，敎你唱歌兒！」糾纏得沒法，他把小毛提下來，小毛坐到他的膝上，一面撫廣他的靑天白日的帽徽。</p>
<p>「來！來！來！大家一起來！不分男女與老小，拿起鋤頭與鐮刀！飛機大砲俺都不怕，××！××！你莫逃！」</p>
<p>小毛咿啊咿啊地學着唱，小毛媽壓着沙嗓子喊她不要玩皮，小毛一點沒聽見。</p>
<p>在那首，小毛爹同着一起人來了，挑着滿擔滿擔的東西。鬎鬁老八與憨子阿三肩羞一口新宰的毛豬，東一歪西一倒地行來。村長像塊矮墩子，今天穿起了馬褂，面孔漲得像豬肝，一聯串地道着：</p>
<p>「各位辛苦！辛苦！降臨到敝村。這是一點點小小敬意，可是眞不算數的，眞不算數的！」</p>
<p>一位官長挺禮貌地站起來歡接着村長，他年紀很輕，面孔很淸秀，還帶着兩隻皮手套</p>
<p>「那裹！那裹！你們的東西都是流汗換來的，怎好呌我們生受。我們經過的地方是不碰老百姓的一草一木的。你們只記着，你們看見了我們，你們就有自由，你們又可好好地做生活，敵人再也不來了，你們一帶是我們的勢力圈。現在，把這些東西都帶回去吧！你們也是不容易的……」</p>
<p>小毛爹一起人把東西放了就走開，把這位年靑官長急得連連揮手。</p>
<p>金家村父變成了桃源，充滿了歡笑與和平。他們與他們已沒有一綫界限可分，全像一母所生的親兄弟。</p>
<p>頭頂上一片藍天，陽光照澈了原野，婦女們很放心地放出了鷄羣與羊羣。</p>
<p>小毛張着小嘴，咿啊啊地唱：</p>
<p>「來！來！來！大家一起來！不分男女與老小，拿起鋤頭與鐮刀……」</p>
<p>胖子兵笑得坐不住，向地上倒下去了。</p>
<h3>田園氣息</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>不知道爲了什麼緣故，近來常常撩起眷戀田園的情緒。</p>
<p>由於這樣撩起的結果，更覺得田園愛不忍釋；而且『香遠益淸」了！</p>
<p>我更記不起當初爲什麼要這般殘忍地離開了她的理由，如今祇覺得一日沒有聞到田園氣息而凄凄戚戚！雖然這是空凄切；然而辜負了她的一層，已經百喙莫贖了。</p>
<p>唉！唉！中國！中國！偌大的中國，百分之九十九仍然躺在田園間——雖然都市在爾袋上怎樣的裝腔作勢。</p>
<p>我離開光天化日下可愛的田園，又是一年了；總算撈獲都市的一角小天地，栩然自以爲可以生活下去了，其實何會？其實何必。</p>
<p>內疚的箭鏃，因此根根密集在心的靶子上，而且與日俱增。</p>
<p>田園！雖然久別了；你的氣息，雖然不一定會飄過這邊來，然而，我知道：逗人的，繾綣的情絲，和氣息，一定依舊在那裹醖釀着；就是阻隔着焦土，也還是牽住了旅子的心</p>
<p>金黃色的萊花，麥頭簸弄出來的風的翅膀，這一切，我有點不敢重提，——害怕！爲的是提起來恐怕要多洒一腔熱淚。然而關不住的『月下風傳打稻聲』，又那麼浮上心頭！我雖則用立體型的建築物來冲散了這一切，且讓流綫型的汽車載走，却不提防到初七晚上天邊的一鈎新月，仍然不住的嘲弄着旅子殘缺的心，還倒下來好多人鬼莫測的憧憧影子。</p>
<p>田園氣息，聞不到了。</p>
<p>這裹，展開了一個逐浪的人波，一批過去，新的又有一批來。不錯，他們的鞋尖，他們的衣角，還帶來田園的塵埃，更滲透了田園的氣息。但是，你想靠了這點來溫存枯槁的心嗎？不，决不能；馬上就要消失的。</p>
<p>這消失，大概是爲了乾　而貧血的菜根還可以一咬，雖然受過電刑的蔬果，也何嘗不値得一嚼？不相信，維他命X，Y，Z，都適應環境的需求而格外『異說紛紜』起來了！雖然『莫衷一是』，也還得起勁地拉開喉嚨說下去：『這是人類的食糧呀！』登過龍門——其實半路上『拉馬班師回朝』的——鯉，却那麼瞠目地翻起白光直釘着的眼，雖然還有點『餘威震殊族』的『虎虎』，然而筆直者鰭鱗，任人拉開値得顧慮的鰓鰓，一點也吐不出生活上必需的泡沫來，『拉倒』在菜販攤上了！這眞是一個上好的異地風光。</p>
<p>我窒息着，我我不到新鮮氣息，歸去罷，不如歸去。幹什麼要在這裏鬼混。</p>
<h3>進城　（下）</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>「我回家拿去。」</p>
<p>「天晚了！今天起聽說改五點鐘關城門，提早啦，哼，你哪兒曉得？」</p>
<p>「不是爲大坎子上公路的洋橋被遊擊隊燒掉嗎？我知道一點。」</p>
<p>我們一夥兒搶着問：</p>
<p>「怎麼？遊擊隊不是早跑掉了—他們纔擺好火油，給××趕來，早跑了嗎？」</p>
<p>老頭見搶先回答：</p>
<p>「你們不知道，大坎子的人纔够英雄呢！他們全是好漢喲！遊擊隊聽說去了四個，他們早跟村子裏好漢們講好，准得毀了那橋，××不知道遊擊隊去了，還有村上的人呢。遊繫隊的事，好漢們都會代做喲。××一走，幾百雙手，堆起十幾筒火油，一座洋橋，乾脆就完事，他們眞齊心啦。」</p>
<p>我試探地問：</p>
<p>「好好的座橋，可惜嗎！燒掉！」</p>
<p>老頭子和年靑人都搖搖頭，異口同聲地說</p>
<p>「燒掉的好！現在橋不是我們的了，他們的卡車，坦克車，整天開來開去，走過那橋，裝兵，裝子彈，打死我們，這橋還要牠幹嗎？」</p>
<p>憤怒的火花開在兩個純眞的人臉上，使我酸辛，感喟，尊崇。</p>
<p>那年靑的小夥激動地，張開粗的手臂，告訴我們說：</p>
<p>「下大坎子去的四個遊擊隊眞有種！挺着××的巡查，幾根手槍給瞞過了。四個人！只有四個人喲！幹那樣大事！聽說裹面有一個，膀子上吃了一顆子彈，這才可憐！不知道他殘廢沒有呢？……」</p>
<p>我暗地推一推老張，我神秘地笑，老王老林也都對他笑。老張呢，嘻開鯨魚嘴，扁着嘴對我們笑。我想，更大的痛苦逼着我們，他該忘記了更小的痛苦吧。</p>
<p>松樹林那邊，發出喜悅的聲音來了。嗤嗤牙牙！嗤嗤牙牙！酒鬼王三的一張酒糟臉，挺在樹幹旁邊。費勁轉了一轉，車給推上大路了</p>
<p>我們埋怨他：</p>
<p>「你酒喝多啦！醉得路也走不起！我們等你好久！」</p>
<p>「唉！我今天做這麼大要緊事，怎好吃酒？我自已願意幹這事，拚着我的頭！（他指着自己的頭，但等他看見老頭兒和小夥子，又突然忌諱了）不是我趕不上，是因爲這車輪脫了轂，剛才修好呢。」</p>
<p>我們又開始作神聖的鬥士了。</p>
<p>裝做不認識酒鬼，分成兩批，我們這一夥：老張和老林；老王和我。</p>
<p>我們在六尺高的沙袋旁，忍耐着氣忿對××摘下帽子，鞠一鞠躬。</p>
<p>那木籠，一共三個。××都不站在籠裏。他們指指我們的膀臂，問我們多大年歲：我們回答了；望望那「膏藥」，我們通過了。</p>
<p>我們一夥，四個人，進城了。</p>
<p>接着那酒鬼的車兒來了—嗤嗤—牙牙……</p>
<p>「檢查嗎？」</p>
<p>「翻得儘够了。哈哈！有什麼好翻呢？—一袋米，兩袋米！」</p>
<p>我們笑得打哈哈。</p>
<p>我們的朋友迎接着我們，我們興奮極啦！手互相緊緊握着。我告訴他們大坎子洋橋給燒了的事，他們喜歡得掉下淚來。</p>
<p>他們也告訴我們一個好消息，在今天已有十輛小車傢伙進城了。</p>
<p>而且他們握着我們底手說——</p>
<p>祝你們平安進城！」</p>
<p>是的，我們進城了。黑漆的地獄將會透起紅亮的火光，在明天。</p>

<h3>海上羣星會見紀　—除夕影人會串雜寫</h3>
<p>— 冰獨</p>
<p>是遊藝界空前的盛事，全滬影人集體地為了徵募認養難民在大除夕參加新新電台舉行歌播會串。也許是，在收音機上，您早就聽到了，可是，你祗是由空氣中聽到她與他們的歌喉，您是不會容易知道當時電台上活生生的動態和銀星們的風趣吧，那正是夠多麼興味的。</p>
<p>所謂明星的招待席，在二樓，茶室裏一長行方桌排列起來，假使誰會得在電梯上或者就在酒樓的玻璃門上張望一下，明星們便會被飽覽無遺，因為大除夕的房間和酒室照例是不容易臨時設法佔據的。由於一張小小「明星休息處」白紙的吸引，「看明星囉」，驚動了多少酒客旅人，也有影迷之類的乘了這飛來機會向侍者索了一張白紙請她或他們簽名，當然來不及的還是女人。</p>
<p>七點鍾，休息處已經有鄭小秋，黃槐生，王仰樵等幾個職員出現，不久，夢鶴來了，接着是蘭根，這當然是挺早的一批。</p>
<p>女星以襲秋霞，胡蓉蓉最早，伴着來的是心靈和他的老封翁。七點三刻，影人源源而至。梅　，白燕，王蘭，張琬，王引，談瑛……。星光燦爛，新新茶室變成了一個嫦娥殿也是個水晶宮。</p>
<p>這一次，最引人注意的則是南國影後陳雲裳了。穿着紅色的西報，棕梠色的皮膚和健美嬌小的南國女兒，給人以桃樂賽拉摩的感覺，在童月娟的介紹之下，非常和婉溫靜，絕沒有一點虛榮淺薄，矜驕的浮態。</p>
<p>為了她，將受聘派拉蒙到好萊塢繼續黃柳霜Ahua　May　Wang為祖國唯一在影城活躍的藝人，於國際的觀瞻，藝術的介紹等，都必然將發生若干影響，除了向這位不可多得的藝人致敬以外，我們更應該嚴格地作友誼的檢視，但是，雖則是匆匆一面，為了當時因會串的事務太忙，沒有時間多談無從明白她，可是，在一個普通的酬酢中，有着和柔的笑容與謙虛的靜默，正是到一個人地生疏的集會中最好的交際，便留人以良好的印象。我覺得他很能懂得自己的地位。我不反對愛美，然而在蔡瑾，王人美，袁美雲等的自然皮膚之下，使人興起了濃脂艷粉的庸俗。那天，羣星中找　不出奢侈虛榮的惡習，但也免不了偶爾有淺薄的感覺。</p>
<p>談瑛為口啞，帶了唱片來，可是結果　得開口，金　穿了短大衣和梅　合唱雄壯的歌曲，陳雲裳是廣東人，但能唱平劇，國語與英語均不錯。九點鍾，四〇六號房間的播音室，開始空前的盛況，社會領袖，電影業巨頭，茶室裏祗留下了喜歡冷靜的　　羣洪警鈴。所有的人馬樓上去了。</p>
<p>天氣這麼冷，但四〇六號擠滿了五六十人，水汀像加倍的榨取着各人的汗珠，門口幸虧有兩個門崗，鐵漢一樣的阻攔了汹湧不斷的人潮。電話，像連珠般的來，索照片，請談話，點唱……可惜電話機沒裝上一千具，明星們也分不開身。</p>
<p>十二點鍾，星兒散了。</p>
<p>影人的簽名</p>
<h3>影壇珍屑</h3>
<p>— 銀角</p>
<p>陳雲裳已訂鶼鰈盟</p>
<p>陳雲裳主演的「木蘭從軍」古裝片，定今日起在三角地華新攝影場（即聯華廠原址）開拍。「木蘭從軍」的劇本，出於留港某名戲家之手，所以故事的結構，意識相當健全，張善琨上次從香港回滬，就將故事劇本帶了來，而分幕對白劇本則是此次陳雲裳携來。「木蘭從軍」的男主角決定為梅熹，期以一個半月完成，之後陳雲裳將續演一片，然後再回到香港去，據說將與陳維周的公子結婚以後，再出國赴美。陳維周的公子，與陳雲裳已訂　臂之盟；陳雲裳在香港，有一輛流綫型的自備汽車，就是陳維周公子所贈的一份聘禮。陳雲裳與陳維周的公子，都是姓陳，五百年前共一家，五百年後又將成為一家人，倒也是一段佳話。</p>
<p>袁美雲指上新鑽戒</p>
<p>袁美雲從前會以八百元的代價，買了一隻鑽戒，戴在指上，熠熠生光，顯得很不錯的樣子。最近，袁美雲指上的鑽戒，已換了一枚新的了！原來袁美雲新近收入了一筆鉅款，那是從藝華影業公司取得的；藝華公司在今年的製片程序表上，列入了方沛霖導演袁美雲主演的「三集化身姑娘」，準備於春光明媚之際開攝。方沛霖與袁美雲現在都是新華公司的人，經藝華小主人嚴幼祥向新華商借，已得張善琨的同意，同時藝華又預付了一筆酬金給袁美雲，於是袁美雲便將原有的鑽戒兌去，另外買了一隻顆粒更大，光彩更足的新鑽戒，代價是一千五百元，於此也可見袁美雲近來的生活，是如何的富麗了。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（六）（三）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>余叔岩歷訪明師十餘人</p>
<p>的確無論那一位享大名的伶工，都是從艱苦中磨鍊而成，老譚的成功，日前已說得很为详盡，老譚而後的生行祭酒，當然要算餘叔岩了。說起叔岩當日習藝時的種種困難，也足以使一般僥倖成名的鬚生，有些自愧自恧。叔岩拜老譚的始末，本篇業已談過，不過在他贅人譚門的一前一後，還有他請教過的許多明師，似乎也得提上一提。當他以小小余三勝的藝名出演各處的時候，那不過是普通一般童伶的藝能，及至倒嗓以後，常到各票房走走，就識得高人多了。故都著名的春陽友會，人才鼎盛，叔岩也是會員之一。彼時陳十二（彥衡）王君直都是平津學譚極著名的票界名宿，學識固佳，字眼兒又極考究，所以這兩位先生，可算是指示叔岩唱念字眼的外行師傳。此外還有一位老名士魏　公，崑曲皮簧，無不皆有深切的研究，　跡歌場約數十年，所聽名伶佳劇，不可勝數，對於叔岩也特予垂青，這算他問字求知談論戲劇的良師益友。至於內行裏的名師，除老譚不計外，像朱天祥錢金福等是教他靠把，工架，刀槍把子的老師；王長林，陳德霖等是給他說身段，作派等等的老師；錢，陳，王，三老，不但都是淨，旦，丑，三行的佼佼人物，而且還都是同老譚配戲久的角兄。所以像「定軍山」「珠廉寨」「五家坡」「探母」「汾河灣」「南天門」「打棍出箱」「天雷報」這些生淨，生旦，生丑，合演的戲，差不多都是這三位內廷老供奉替他說的。（內行人教戲，呌說戲，如云某戲是某人給我說的。）</p>
<p>叔岩及其靠把戲老師錢老金福之寗武關</p>

<h3>談談汽車運輸事業</h3>
<p>— 丁祖澤</p>
<p>美國汽車運輸事業自創始迄今。已屆二十年。雖較其他運輸事業之歷史爲短。然其發展之速。有超越其他運輸事業而居領袖之地位。現今美國全國述輸汽車之總數。據可靠之估計。已達五十六萬八千輛之巨數。雇工數的一百萬人。較美國鐵路運輸工人猶多。可見此事業之龐大矣。</p>
<p>汽車運輸事業可分爲長途與短途二種。長途之距離有達七百英里者。在美國西部有數路在一千英里左右。行駛之狀况在某種之環境下。亦頗滿意。不論長途或短途之運輸公司。其營業方式槪可分爲兩種。一種爲訂定合同。按定價定期者。一種爲有定價而無固定之交運者。</p>
<p>爲適合現代都市之需要。汽車運輸事業實更易發達。船舶火車之抵埠或離埠者均需汽車爲之轉運。食物之按時分送。工業產物之分配。建築物之拆毀與建造。重大物件之移動。均不能不藉運輸汽車。汽車運輸現在已超出鐵路運輸。其比例的爲鐵路貨運佔百分之四十六。汽重貨運則佔百分之五十四。允以二百五十英里以下短距離之貨運爲興旺。比較長距離貨運增多八倍。</p>
<p>在美國長途汽車運輸公司。其路綫在二百五十英里以上者。其規模之大。貨物裝卸悉照鐵路方式。與其擁有鉅數車輛。仍能獲得盈利。論者謂以大規模公司。經營長距離運輸。似不甚相宜。</p>
<p>汽車運輸之所以受人歡迎。與其如此發達。自有種種理由。據由三萬五千四百六十八家客商所舉出者。可列舉如下</p>
<p>原因　客商百分比</p>
<p>運輸迅速……六五</p>
<p>可直達店門交卸……六五</p>
<p>總運費低廉……五三</p>
<p>可在店門裝載……五一</p>
<p>比較有伸縮便利……四三</p>
<p>包裝比較價廉……二一</p>
<p>報裝之時間可較二一</p>
<p>運價分類不繁……一六</p>
<p>貸物遺失與損失較少……一一</p>
<p>個人間之友誼與興趣……三</p>
<p>由上表觀之。一般歡迎汽車運輸者。以其迅速固甚明矣。復據統計。知汽車運輸之速率。平均每小時十五英里。鐵路爲五英里。水道爲三至一英里。管中輸送（按美國煤油礦所產煤油原油。大多以巨管輸至遠距礦塲之精煉廠。）每小時一至五英里。由此可知汽車運輸之速度。比鐵路快三倍。</p>
<p>汽車運輸之另一優點。爲其路綫終點之選擇不若鐵路或輪埠之受種種限制。反之其終點乃極爲活動而富有仲縮性。至於大公司之汽車路綫終點。亦有司機宿舍。管理員辦公室。及修車塲等設備。</p>
<p>平常式樣之運輸汽車。司機人位置之前爲引擎。即司機人之位置在車頭之後的三尺。現今新式運輸汽車乃高車頭式。司機人之位置即在引擎之上（如本埠中國公共汽車公司之車輛式樣）。其優點甚多。因司機位置移至引擎之上。可以高瞻遠矚。司機之視綫甚廣。雖在擁擠之鬧市中。亦可準確運轉。其决載貨之地位。比舊式增長不下三尺。再次爲負載之重量。得平均分配於前後卑軸上。其結果可使行駛更爲經濟。</p>
<p>汽車運輸利用拖車。現亦逐漸增多。採用拖車之利益甚多。蓋在拖車裝卸貨物之時。卡車可以另拖其他拖車。或駛往修理廠修理。絕不致妨碍貨物之裝卸。而現今拖車之製造亦甚完善。其與卡車連接之機件。裝拆極便。甚至司機人無須下車。亦可使拖車自動脫離。更有一種半拖車（拖車之後半部裝有輪軸。其前半部則擱架於下車之後輪軸上者。在脫離卡車後。可藉具前半部所裝之攔脚穩立於地。）因可用小馬力之小卡車拖帶。故其數量亦甚多。尤其適合於平地行駛。可增加負載甚多。新式半拖車之安全設備。最足稱道。即在行駛途中不愼與卡車脫離。能自動放下擱脚。自動停止。不致有傾覆衝撞之危險也。</p>
<p>「美國汽車運輸事業之營業帳略。與其成本計算之材料。頗不易得。蓋因各公司俱不詳細登帳也。其中有營業忙碌。記帳時間不充分而付缺如者。亦有僅計每年總收支。以結出若干盈餘草草了事。至於大規模公司之記帳。雖比較詳細但於分類統計仍嫌不足。因此關於車輛機件方面。何者有利。何奢不經濟。俱難考查。以資將來取舍之標準。故此篇所列數字。僅可備爲參考。不能引爲全豹。」</p>
<p>某一大汽車運輸公司。以一汽油引擎卡車。行駛於二百英里之路綫上。全年共行八萬英里。每程載重二十噸。共費一萬七千四百九十三美元。計每英里需美金二角二分。另一同式卡車行於四百英里路棧上。全年共駛九萬六千英里。共費一萬九千六百五十七美兀。的計每英里所費不足美金二角二分。</p>
<p>後據加州所調查。公路運輸汽車之汽油消費量。可列表如次。</p>
<p>（註）此處爲美國介侖。約等於英國介侖五分之四。或等於三。七五公升</p>
<p>上表所列之數目。因其路綫限於內與行駛長途者。不能並論</p>
<p>甚至有種種統計。企圖證明汽車運輸在某一里程。比鐵路運輸昂貴。但亦不吾認在二百五—英里至三百英里之里程。以汽車運輸爲經濟。惟現今七百至一千英里之長途汽車運輸營業。及蒸蒸日上焉。</p>
<p>美國政府每年從汽車運輸事業抽收之捐稅。必將超過十萬萬美元。據美國統計局發表。在一九三五年份。彼時僅有運輸汽車公司六萬一千二百十六家。卡車十八萬八千八百〇九輛。已收稅五萬三千〇八十六萬美元。其車輛數僅佔本年三分之一耳。</p>
<p>總之美國汽車運輸事業。雖有重稅之壓迫。與堅强之鐵路同業競爭。但其所供獻者已甚大。如减少失業人數。促進交通便利。間接促進汽車工程之進步。皆不可掩之事實也。</p>
<h3>雙逢二十五週年紀念之　中國汽車公司與新道奇</h3>
<p>— 翹篔</p>
<p>於西歷一九一四年即已開始在上海及華中經營汽車業務之飛星及東方兩汽車公司。乃美商中國汽車公司之前身。故中國汽車公司之紉辦。迄於今茲。實已二十有五載。而該公司獨家經理之道奇牌客車及運輸車。亦即於該公司初創時嶄然露其頭角。故本年一九三九年度。又適爲該公司靭立與道奇車在華行銷雙逢二十五週年紀念之期。該公司與道奇廠。於二十五年後之今日。所最足以自豪者。厥爲中國汽車公司。因已於上海及華中方面。獲得極大之成功而同時「道奇最可靠二語。且已成爲世界週知之成語是也。</p>
<p>按過去之二十五年。不僅對於汽軍界爲一極重耍之時期。抑且爲中國公路建設最發達之時期。中國公路之建設。爲時固短。但其進展則殊迅速。近年來中國境內交通與運輸之便利。遠勝往昔。泰半蓋不得不歸功於公路之敷設也。</p>
<p>公路交通。端以汽車爲必不可少之利器。蓋欲便利行旅。减低運費。固非汽車不克也。關於此點。中國汽車公司實已不無相當之貢獻。蓋除以品質精良。效用卓越。絕對可靠。而代價又極公道之道奇出品。供各界採辦外。復於華中設立申行多處。本歷年之經騐。作忠實服務。其有裨於公路效能增進與維持者。蓋匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>中國汽車公司代理總經理賀倫氏（Mr．V．J．B．Hulladn）語人曰。一九三九年式新道奇商用車與運輸車。爲紀念銀色周年之精品。故無論以外觀式樣。內部設備。動作效能，經濟合算。或任何方面而言。其可靠程度。實更駕歷來出品而上之云。</p>

        <h1>1939.01.03</h1>
<h3>After Wang Jingwei's Expulsion from the Party, the Central Propaganda Department Issues a Statement to the Outside World: Wang's Declaration Can Only Represent His Personal Intentions; the Established National Policy of Resistance Against Japan Will Not Be Relaxed Due to This; Internal Traitors Will Be Eliminated, and We Will Fight the Japanese to the End</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the Central Propaganda Department and the Political Department issued (A) a statement to the outside world and (B) instructions to party departments at all levels and political training personnel in the armed forces regarding the matter of Zhao Ming's (Wang Jingwei's courtesy name) violation of discipline and harm to the party and the country. Key points are recorded separately as follows: Statement to the outside world: (1) Mr. Wang's decision to leave the country for recuperation was not communicated to comrades in the country beforehand, nor was a formal letter or telegram sent afterward. It is clear that this was a purely personal action and has no connection with the party, government, or military. His actions outside the country cannot be regarded as representing any aspect. Furthermore, the leader had already solemnly declared to China and foreign countries in the press. Recently, Mr. Wang suddenly published his so-called "suggestion to the central government" in Hong Kong newspapers. The central government has not yet received it, but it has already been widely publicized abroad. Given Mr. Wang's history in the party and the country, it is inappropriate both in terms of sentiment and reason to take such action. (2) Mr. Wang's declaration can only represent his personal intentions, or the cowardly and despicable mentality of a very small number of weak-willed people who willingly allow themselves to be used by the enemy and puppets. It will not have any impact on the overall prospect of the war of resistance, because Mr. Wang's personal opinion is not enough to shake the firm will of the entire military and civilian population to resist Japan. (3) As for the Sino-Japanese issue, it is not a matter of a day or two, let alone a matter for one or two individuals. The central government's decision to resist Japan is in accordance with the instructions of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will and is based on the unanimous demands of the people of the whole country. Therefore, resistance against Japan is our country's established national policy, which cannot be easily shaken or changed by the dissenting opinions of one or two individuals. Since the September 18th Incident, the entire country, from top to bottom, has endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens. Mr. Wang's pain and indignation towards the Japanese invaders is well known to the people of the country. From the Battle of Shanghai to the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, Mr. Wang personally experienced them. His advocacy of sincere unity and joint efforts to overcome national difficulties is still fresh in our minds. In terms of both theory and sentiment, how could there be such contradictory statements? (4) Mr. Wang's statement is probably a temporary deception by the enemy's cunning. Konoe's absurd declaration included "The trinity of Japan, Manchuria and China," "Stationing troops and free residence in the Chinese mainland," and "Joint anti-communism, including the stationing of troops in Inner Mongolia," none of which are not conspiracies to destroy China. Even a three-foot-tall child knows the dangerous poison of his schemes. Our leader has long since severely denounced them one by one, exposing them without reservation. Mr. Wang's self-contradictory propositions from Hong Kong are undoubtedly something that those close to him grieve over and those who hate him rejoice over. To take a step back, if Konoe's statement has even the lowest level of sincerity, it further proves that the Japanese invaders are exhausted and have reached the end of their rope. We should actively counterattack, recover lost territory, and complete the final victory. How can we seek compromise halfway at this time? (5) Facts prove that the Japanese invaders' recent smokescreen of seeking peace is entirely a probe before a new offensive. Konoe's statement can be described as a kind of manipulation for Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang is unwilling to trust the ultimate success of the entire military and civilian population's resistance against Japan, but instead trusts Konoe's deceptive conspiracy. Korea is a good example. May those who understand righteousness, like Mr. Wang, reconsider. Although Mr. Wang's decision to act may have its reasons for himself, in the past, Mr. Wang sometimes showed firmness and sometimes wavering in the revolutionary process. During the current period of new difficulties in the war of resistance, he may have experienced temporary wavering, thus leaving the revolution. Although this will not have any impact on the country's war of resistance, everyone who respects and loves Mr. Wang cannot help but feel deeply sorry. (6) However, it is found that at the time of success of revolutions in various countries, there often occur elements who attempt to compromise halfway and leave the revolution. This is an inevitable phenomenon in the revolutionary process. Not to mention the distant past, but in recent times, such as those who left the party and attached themselves to Yuan Shikai in the early years of the Republic, and Chen Jiongming's betrayal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, are examples. However, this is still a personal action and not a division of the revolutionary camp. In fact, the revolutionary forces will inevitably become more united and stronger as a result, and their development and success will be more assured. Today, with our great enemy in front of us, we must be of one heart and one mind to obey the supreme leader, resolutely resist Japan to the end, and never relax because of the enemy's instigation.</p>
<p>(B) Internal instructions: (1) Resistance against Japan is the established national policy of our party and will not be easily changed due to the dissenting opinions of one or two comrades. The central government's decision to resist Japan is not a matter of a day or two, nor is it a matter for one or two individuals. There is a basis for this in the historical documents of our party. (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and will have long foreseen that the completion of the National Revolution cannot be achieved without resistance against Japan to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality. (2) The declarations and resolutions of previous congresses of our party have all stated that when the nation is in danger of extinction and peace is at the last moment, the entire nation must resolutely rise up to resist foreign aggression and must not compromise halfway and hasten its own demise. (2) Mr. Wang's sudden declaration on December 29 last year is an act of betrayal against the party and the country. First, Mr. Wang, as vice president, has violated party discipline and violated the party's declaration and resolutions. How can he face Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven and the millions of soldiers and civilians who died in the war of resistance? Second, since the September 18th Incident, Mr. Wang has strongly advocated sincere unity and joint efforts to overcome national difficulties. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he resolutely advocated long-term resistance against Japan. At the Provisional National Congress, he enthusiastically supported the outline of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. He has never had different opinions on the war of resistance. Now, at the most critical moment of the war of resistance, he suddenly issued such a contradictory declaration, which makes us feel sorry for Mr. Wang personally. (3) The content of Mr. Wang's declaration clearly shows that he has yielded to Japanese imperialism and recognized its conditions for the destruction of China. The so-called "joint anti-communism" (including the stationing of troops in Inner Mongolia), the so-called "free residence," and the so-called "economic cooperation" are all accepted one by one. Subjectively, Mr. Wang may not be willing to please Japan and echo the traitors, but objectively, he is surrendering to the enemy and selling out the motherland. In the history of our revolution, it will be the greatest stain forever. However, we still hope that Mr. Wang will repent and return to the ranks of the war of resistance, which will still be gratifying for the nation and the country. Otherwise, Mr. Wang's personal political life will be completely ruined from now on. (4) However, Mr. Wang's departure from the revolution will objectively make us more united and determined in the war of resistance. Therefore, Mr. Wang's actions will have no impact on the party and the country. Apart from adding another tool for the enemy and puppets to swindle and deceive, it will not have any effect. Only Mr. Wang's personal loss, that is, destroying his revolutionary history and betraying the people of the whole country and all party comrades, is the most regrettable. Although, according to the revolutionary history of various countries, there are always vacillating elements who attempt to compromise halfway and leave the revolution. This is an inevitable process in the revolutionary process, such as the Yuan Shikai's attempt to usurp power by forming a cabinet during the Wuchang Uprising, and Chen Jiongming's rebellion later, are all examples of the dust that is discarded in the advancement of the revolutionary train. However, these are all personal actions and not a division of the revolutionary camp. Therefore, we must, in a positive way, strengthen the unity of revolutionary forces, and in a negative way, not do things that make those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice, so as to promote the success of the revolution. Mr. Wang's decisive declaration must be felt with infinite pain by all of us who are loyal to the party and love the country. But we (with a sword against our chest, not looking aside,) must now step up the second phase of the war of resistance, eliminate internal traitors, and resolutely fight the enemy to the end. The final victory can be expected. (A telegram from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Yesterday, at the joint meeting of the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated being lenient towards Wang, proposing to first give friendly advice, then give a warning, and finally expel him from the party if he is stubborn. However, according to Reuters reporters who learned from reliable sources, Kuomintang leaders were extremely indignant at Wang's peace telegram and unanimously passed a resolution to permanently expel him from the party. It is said that Wu Zhihui and Zhang Ji, two elders who had worked with Wang for ten years, were also extremely angry. It is reported that Wang's telegram was sent on December 29 and was distributed to various newspapers in Hong Kong by Lin Baisheng on the 1st. It arrived in Chongqing yesterday morning. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately convened a joint meeting of the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee, attending in person, without resting on New Year's Day. The National Government also issued an order that anyone participating in a regime organized by the Japanese would be arrested and prosecuted for the crime of endangering the Republic of China. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Zhou Enlai, a leader of the Chinese Communist Party, told Reuters reporters today that Wang Jingwei's peace movement was nothing new to him, because he had been with Wang for twenty years and knew that he was a coward. Wang often changed his direction in his political career. He cooperated with the Communist Party in Wuhan in 1927. He participated in Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's anti-Chiang rebellion and joined Hu Hanmin's Guangzhou mutiny. However, he always betrayed his friends when the situation was difficult. Wang is a speculator, so he has always adopted a policy of minimum resistance. The first movement to negotiate peace with Japan appeared after the fall of Guangzhou in October last year and before the fall of Hankou. In a conversation with Reuters reporters, he expressed his preparation for China to negotiate peace with Japan. All senior military officers who participated in the Southern Hunan Military Conference in November condemned the absurdity of his remarks. Zhang Fakui, who is currently commanding the battle in Guangdong Province and is a long-time friend of Wang, also attacked Wang severely. At the National Political Participation Council held in Chongqing in November, a confidant of Wang also made the absurd statement that British, American, French and Soviet assistance cannot be relied upon, and China must seek a peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese conflict with the help of Germany and Italy. Wang has been in contact with the Japanese through his confidants in Hong Kong. At least two of his confidants have traveled to Tokyo. In fact, Wang's actions cannot undermine China's internal unity, nor can they harm China's strength in resisting Japan. Except for a few insignificant people such as Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi, there are currently few people in the party, the government, or the military who support Wang. It is still doubtful whether Gu Mengyu or Chen Gongbo are as corrupt as Wang. As for the rumor that Wang's trip to Hong Kong had been approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in advance, it is absolutely untrue. He knew and firmly believed that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had nothing to do with Wang's actions. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang plans to go to Nanjing to convene a fake Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, using the name to negotiate peace with Japan and confront the Central Government's Fifth Plenary Session. He is currently secretly negotiating with Doihara in Hong Kong. Wachi has been sent back to Shanghai to prepare everything. (Special telegram from 8 p.m. on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang originally planned to convene a fake plenary session in Hong Kong and had a conversation with Zhang Fakui's representative, but was rejected. Wang then secretly left Hong Kong on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso and arrived in Shanghai on the 31st. Various women's organizations telegraphed Lin and Chiang, supporting the war of resistance and denouncing Wang. (Special telegram from the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to yesterday's Chinese evening newspaper, Wang Jingwei will indeed go to Shanghai. "Wen Zongyao, President of the Legislative Yuan of the Reformed Government," telegraphed Wang two days ago, inviting him to go north. Therefore, it is generally speculated that Wang may collude with the "Reformed Government." (Express News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Guangdong Province Are Still Coiled Up, Stubbornly Defending; Building Fortifications in Guangzhou, Huangpu and Other Places to Defend Against Chinese Army Attacks; Bai Chongxi Inspects Defense Areas and Promotes Political Work</h3>
<p>Guilin Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Military Headquarters recently returned here after inspecting the defense areas. In order to understand the latest developments in the war situation in South China, the reporter paid a special visit this morning and inquired about the situation. He was told that although the Japanese troops in central Guangdong have been slightly active recently, except for Sanshui, where troops have been increased to the strength of one division, other areas are still coiled up and stubbornly defending. Guangzhou City is doing its best to consolidate, so heavy troops are deployed in Shunde, Huangpu, Zengcheng, Foshan, Sanshui, and Jiujiang, actively building fortifications to protect Guangzhou City and defend against Chinese attacks. The strength of the Japanese army in southwestern Guangdong Province has not increased, and they are still entrenched, waiting for reinforcements. Looking at the battles on various fronts, they seem to be silent on the surface, but this silence is by no means stagnation. Since the Chinese army's counterattack on Guangzhou, the Japanese have suffered heavy losses. The strength of the Japanese has been defeated by the Chinese and they are unable to commit crimes. At present, it seems that they are trying to replenish their forces, so there is no major battle. However, the Japanese are still actively plotting in southwestern Guangdong Province. The Chinese side has insight into the various conspiracies of the Japanese army, and all routes are deployed and ready to wait in strict array. The Japanese army intends to peep into Nanning from Beihai and cut off the Chinese army's important traffic lines, but the traffic in that area has been thoroughly blocked by the Chinese army, and guerrillas are swarming up at the same time. At the same time, the mountains are steep, and the terrain is favorable to China. If the Japanese army comes to commit crimes, it will be wiped out. Although the Japanese army's attack on Wuzhou from Xijiang has been severely attacked, the attempt to commit crimes has not been interrupted. I dare to expect that if the Japanese army comes again, the difficulties it encounters will be ten times more difficult than before. Bai continued that the second phase of the all-out war of resistance has already begun. In order to effectively advance toward the strategy of all-out attack on the Japanese, I have been actively trying to promote politics over military affairs and the people over the soldiers. In particular, this decision to go to the front line for inspection, I feel that the political power is very important. In Guangxi, it is planned to formulate a national public regulation, which is being drafted. Once passed, the people of the entire province will be automatically sworn to abide by it. The content is roughly as follows: In terms of combat, it is determined not to be a traitor, not to be a compliant citizen, not to be a Japanese spy, not to participate in a puppet organization, not to build roads for the Japanese, and not to lead the way for the Japanese. In terms of economy, it is determined not to purchase Japanese goods, not to buy Japanese raw materials, not to use Japanese currency, and not to cooperate with the Japanese economy. If this plan is implemented in Guilin, I plan to recommend it to the Central Government. I believe that this will definitely have great power in the all-out war of resistance strategy.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese military information, the Chinese army in Dongjiang, Guangdong Province, did indeed completely recapture Zengcheng on the 31st of last month. Shilong is still under siege by the Chinese army, but the main force of the Japanese army has retreated to Shitan, and the Japanese army in Dongguan seems to be retreating to Humen.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from foreigners in Guangzhou received here, Chinese guerrillas once broke into Dongshan on New Year's Eve and had a fierce battle with the Japanese army for two hours. The gunfire was very dense, and the number of Japanese casualties is unknown. (Express News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Guilin The Japanese army has repeatedly committed crimes in Xijiang, and has been miserably defeated. It has recently been heard that another division will be transferred to attack Yangjiang and land in the west. The Chinese army has long detected the Japanese army's conspiracy, and has made proper arrangements. At that time, it will definitely give a heavy blow. (Telegram from 4 p.m. on the 1st)</p>
<p>Guilin The Japanese army in Sanshui and Zengcheng has recently increased slightly, maintaining its original position and continuing to rush to build fortifications. There is no intention to commit crimes. However, the advanced troops of the Chinese army are very active, attacking from time to time, and giving them heavy blows. The Japanese army is very panicked. There are more than 500 soldiers of the Japanese army's Ikuta Unit in Jiujiang, more than 100 soldiers of the Japanese army's Nakamura Unit in Heqing, and more than 300 soldiers of the Japanese army's Toyokoro Unit in Shunde.

<h3>Li Hanhun Arrives in Guangdong to Take Office; Takes Office Before 2,000 People on New Year's Day; Then Holds a Solemn Military Parade</h3>
<p>Lianxian Li Hanhun, the new chairman of Guangdong, arrived in Shu on the afternoon of the 31st, and was warmly welcomed by all walks of life. That night, Chairman Wu hosted a banquet to welcome Li, and the two chairmen talked for two hours. In addition to orally describing the provincial political situation, Wu also handed Li a memorandum, which recorded in detail the recent provincial political facilities. Li attached great importance to the memorandum. On New Year's Day morning, the two chairmen handed over the seal in front of 2,000 people, and held a military parade. The new secretary-general Hu Mingkun, finance minister Gu Yiqun, education minister Xu Chongqing, and provincial committee members Zhu Hui and He Tongjun also attended the ceremony. After the event, a grand meeting was held to welcome Chairman Wu and Chairman Li. Wu said in his speech that he originally intended to do his best for his hometown when he returned to Guangdong, but he did not expect that things would not go as he wished, and he expressed his deep apology to his hometown. He also praised Li for his talents and war achievements, and hoped that the people of the province would unite to support him, drive out foreign aggression and feudal remnants, and build a new Guangdong. In his reply, Li expressed his deep admiration for Wu's patience and hard work over the years, saying that if there were no external and internal obstacles, he believed that Wu's facilities would definitely benefit his hometown. He himself would work hard to realize Wu's unfinished business with the spirit of sword and shoes, etc. The whole audience was deeply moved and excited by Wu Li's speech. The simple and solemn grand meeting ended in shouts of "Down with Japanese imperialism." Wu bid farewell to Li and the audience one by one. Wu and Secretary-General Ouyang Ju drove off to Chongqing.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Denounce Wang Jingwei!</h3>
<p>Konoe's absurd speech last month was originally a trial of inducing peace. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek severely refuted it, Japan's ghostly tricks have failed. Unexpectedly, Wang, who held an important position in the central government, dared to openly advocate begging Japan for surrender after abandoning his post and fleeing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that "Anti-Communism is a synonym for the destruction of China," but Wang insisted on "Anti-Communism"; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out that "The so-called no territorial demands actually encompasses China," but Wang said that this was the basis for "Sino-Japanese peace talks"; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also clearly pointed out that "The purpose of the economic group fallacy is to enslave China," but Wang said that this was "a principle that can be agreed upon." Looking at his absurd theory as a whole, there is nothing that does not violate the national policy proclaimed by the supreme leader, and there is nothing that does not distort Japan's intention to destroy China. Recognizing a thief as a father and losing his mind, he can be said to have reached the extreme! Fortunately, after Wang's ravings were published, they immediately aroused unanimous condemnation from all over the country, and they all advocated denunciation, which shows that the Chinese people's determination to resist Japan to the end is as firm as steel, and there is no room for any compromise elements. This is another very inspiring thing.</p>
<p>After reading Wang's blatant "colluding with the enemy to seek surrender" ravings, we can't help but think of his past remarks that hurt the war of resistance, which shows that he has been deliberately betraying the country for a long time. To give a few examples: After the Changsha fire, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Central Propaganda Department issued a declaration stating that this was an accident caused by the local authorities' panic when the incident occurred, but Wang took this opportunity to rant and hurt the national policy of scorched earth resistance. Secondly, China's war of resistance is a protracted war, and guerrilla warfare obviously occupies an important position in the process of protracted war. This has been repeatedly proclaimed by military leaders, and everyone in China knows it. However, Wang has repeatedly injured him, and even absurdly said that the guerrillas "roam around," which is equivalent to a roaming bandit in the late Ming Dynasty. In addition, regarding the diplomatic issue, the supreme leader has repeatedly pointed out that "We should recognize the principle of friends and enemies," but Wang has tried his best to advocate finding friends from among the countries that help Japan. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, Wang has used his lofty position to repeatedly publish such remarks that distort facts and hurt the war of resistance, knowing that he has no understanding of China's national policy of resisting Japan, and has no confidence in the future victory of China's resistance against Japan. Theory and action are consistent, and means and ends are inseparable. A theory that is always distorted will never have correct actions; opposing correct means must be against the goal. This has been proven again on Wang today.</p>
<p>Wang's traitorous face has been clearly revealed to the people of the country, and the Central Party Department has also announced his crimes and resolved to expel him from the party. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon, because it not only shows the progress of the Chinese Kuomintang in the war of resistance, but also shows the upward development of Chinese politics. We have already said that Wang is a bare stick without the masses. His abandonment of his post and escape not only cannot affect China's war of resistance in the slightest, but also clarifies the mechanism of China's war of resistance. It will not (like the aggressors and traitors advertised) promote internal division in China, but will make the national united front more consolidated. In China today, which is determined to resist Japan, there should be no vacillating compromise elements in the governance mechanism. Removing a vacillating compromise element is equivalent to removing a mass of toxic residue, which increases the strength of the war of resistance by one point.</p>
<p>However, although Wang has fled, his crimes must be punished by national law, and he cannot be tolerated even more because he holds the position of Vice President of the Kuomintang and other important positions in the central government. We feel that merely expelling him from the party is not enough, so we hope that the National Government will also immediately issue an order to arrest him and punish him according to law.</p>
<p>We also know that Wang's traitorous actions are not just his own actions, and there must be many accomplices lurking in government agencies, carrying out conspiracies that are detrimental to the war of resistance. We hope that the National Government will also strictly report them and punish them! The National Government has yesterday clearly ordered to reiterate the "Regulations on Punishment of Traitors." The decree has stipulated that "Those who dare to commit treason and risk the world's great injustice" should also be strictly arrested and punished.</p>
<p>As the new year approaches, China's war of resistance is developing in an increasingly favorable direction. The exposure of Wang Jingwei's betrayal has made the war of resistance front more distinct, the political mechanism of China's war of resistance is becoming clearer, and the future of China's war of resistance is becoming more and more brilliant!</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops on the Nanxun Line Continuously Capture Important Strongholds; Three-Pronged Assault Before Dawn on New Year's Day; Golden Hill, Green Hill, and Others Recaptured One After Another</h3>
<p>Zhanggongdu: In the Nanxun battle, apart from minor skirmishes between Chinese guerrillas and the Japanese on the northern bank of the Xiu River in the past month, there had been no fierce fighting on the main front. Since the morning of the 28th, Japanese troops launched an unsuccessful attack on the northern bank of Zhanggongdu. In the afternoon, the battle situation turned calm again. The Chinese side had long intended to break this stalemate and launch a fierce attack on the Japanese. Taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness before dawn on New Year's Day, they suddenly launched a fierce three-pronged assault on key Japanese strongholds between Yongxiu and De'an. One route first launched a strong attack on Japanese troops in Golden Hill and Hejiashan north of Yongxiu. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese were overwhelmed and retreated in disarray. Chinese troops occupied the area before noon and continued to capture Songzhuang, Hushan, and other places. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. It is estimated that over 10 Japanese rifles and other military supplies and documents were captured. Another route was also dispatched at the same time, capturing Green Hill, Gulaoling, and other places, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers, and capturing over 10 rifles and 3 machine guns. Another route also made considerable progress, recapturing Outangshi, Pushan, Xiawang, and other places around 2:00 PM, and continued to flank the Japanese troops in Qiujin. The Japanese troops, caught unprepared by the sudden strong Chinese assault, collapsed in disarray. Chinese troops drove straight in and are currently pursuing the Japanese rear fiercely. Fierce fighting continues between Chinese and Japanese troops in the area north of Baicha. The Nanxun battle, which had been silent for a long time, suddenly delivered amazing news on the auspicious day of New Year's Day in the 28th year of the Republic, truly a supreme gift from the soldiers at the front in Nanxun to the leader and the people of the country, and a sign that the War of Resistance will enter a new stage.

For 30 years, the Chinese Central Government has been unable to establish Kang Province, but now, at the most difficult time of the War of Resistance, it has been able to complete this major undertaking left over for two thousand years, which is enough to strengthen our belief that we will surely win the War of Resistance and surely build the nation.

Wang Jilu and others delivered successive speeches, which were also translated into Tibetan.

<h3>Completing Our Sacred Mission</h3>
<p>— Sun Ke</p>
<p>Time flies, and now it's the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic of China! What everyone remembers is, of course, the sacred War of Resistance that has lasted for one year and six months; what everyone pursues is, of course, a bright and splendid future. We cannot consider everything in the past to be satisfactory, but at least we can say this: the War of Resistance is always satisfactory. The War of Resistance is for the independence of the country, the liberation of the nation, and the freedom and equality of 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The important value of the War of Resistance itself will, of course, make anyone sing its praises. Moreover, the War of Resistance is the revolution. Just as we cannot doubt the revolution, we cannot doubt the War of Resistance; they have the same meaning.</p>
<p>However, engaging in the War of Resistance is not for the sake of the War of Resistance itself. The War of Resistance is merely a means, not an end. Our goal is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Because the new China based on the Three Principles of the People is international equality (Nationalism), political equality (Democracy), and economic equality (People's Livelihood). The War of Resistance is to defeat the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism and further seek the complete realization of Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood. Therefore, what everyone pursues is a bright and splendid future for a new China where "the War of Resistance will surely be won, and the nation will surely be built!"</p>
<p>How can we realize this future? This is the task for all of us!</p>
<p>Now that the goal is placed before us, and the responsibility is placed on the shoulders of each of us, everyone should pay attention to the following matters in the future:</p>
<p>First, we must have a strong belief in national self-esteem and self-confidence. We do not deny that the Chinese nation has some weaknesses and has exposed many moral failings, but the long history and culture of more than 5,000 years is something that no other country can catch up with. The Chinese people's love of peace, emphasis on trustworthiness, and hardworking and thrifty customs are also superior to those of any other nation. The Chinese people are not more foolish than Westerners. The Chinese people's innate intelligence and talent are indeed superior. However, due to the lack of popular education and the fact that politics, economics, and society have not yet reached the level of modernization, many shortcomings are still evident. This is also the reason why China is being invaded and oppressed by powerful enemies. However, invasion and oppression can be regarded as the only opportunity to awaken us, teach us, and improve us! We must never shake our strong belief in national self-esteem and self-confidence! If we fundamentally shake our belief in our own country and nation, then we can only declare spiritual bankruptcy, declare surrender, and willingly disgrace ourselves and become prisoners of imperialism and slaves of the Japanese! Those who have lost confidence are, in national terms, the dregs that should be eliminated; in individual terms, they are the biggest fools in the world.</p>
<p>Second, we must have a thorough understanding of the current military and political situation and an optimistic attitude. Why are some people pessimistic about the current situation? Why do they doubt the future of the War of Resistance? Why do they even hope for compromise and peace? This is undoubtedly due to their unclear assessment and observation of the future of military affairs, politics, and diplomacy. Of course, we do not deny that the loss of territory and troops over the past year or so is a failure rather than a victory. However, we must know that for a weak and backward nation to resist imperialism, this failure is inevitable. If we did not have the established situation of failure first, Japanese imperialists would not have come to invade us in the first place! Therefore, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, what we are fighting for is the final victory, not the gain or loss of a single place or city, or the advantages and disadvantages of a quick battle and quick decision. How can we strive for the final victory? Chairman Chiang has made it clear that what we are fighting for is a "protracted war," a "total war," and an "active war." Now is the time when the total war is unfolding, and the protracted war and the active war are beginning. What we are fighting for is how to consume the enemy and how to exhaust the enemy in the current stage. Only after a certain period of time can we use a major counteroffensive to determine the final victory. Therefore, in terms of the current stage of strategy, there is no need to be pessimistic at all. At the same time, is it only optimistic? Militarily, everything is entering a favorable situation? Politically, it is much more advanced and improved than before the war. In terms of finance, in addition to striving for production to balance exchange rates, we have recently received support from British and American loans. Diplomatically, the positive turnaround in the international situation is even more obvious. Looking at the enemy again: the increase in anti-war sentiment among their general population; the replenishment of their troops has encountered fundamental problems; their finances are even more exhausted and on the verge of collapse; as for their diplomatic isolation and helplessness, they will soon suffer a major blow, and their difficulties need no further discussion. Therefore, we are optimistic from any point of view! We certainly feel strained in many areas, but in fact, the enemy is even more strained than we are. Why do we only value the enemy and belittle ourselves! Everyone should completely overcome and eliminate all wavering ideas and pessimistic emotions!</p>
<p>Third, we must have the spirit of enduring hardship and fighting with perseverance. As mentioned earlier, what we are striving for is the "final victory," so everyone should know that "the more final," the more difficulties and sufferings we will experience. War is originally "something that cannot be avoided." What mankind seeks is peace, not war. The reason why we have no choice but to embark on the path of the War of Resistance is to seek survival for the nation and fight for independence for the country without looking back. In this sense, as long as it is beneficial to the nation and the country, and as long as the sacrifices and costs we pay are sufficient to benefit the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, we can only endure any hardship and suffering with all our might! Therefore, we hope that all compatriots and comrades across the country, whether at the front or in the rear, whether contributing money or effort, must grit their teeth and endure hardship to the end. At the same time, we must fight with the spirit of "seeking life in death" in a struggle where there is an enemy but no me. Now, some people are confined to a corner of the Southwest, thinking about the fall of their hometowns and the loss of their property, and feeling the pressure of life and the difficulty of their situation. As a result, they develop the idea of compromise and surrender from their usual pampered state. This is the most shameful phenomenon! In fact, judging from many current facts, it seems that apart from the soldiers at the front, what hardships have the people in the rear suffered? We only see abnormal prosperity and only see meaningless waste. How can it compare to the strict controls of countries during the European war! How can it compare to the frugality of the people during the European war! The current situation in China is indeed pathological and indeed needs to be corrected. However, on the other hand, it also shows that China has vast land and abundant resources, and its economic resilience is far beyond the reach of Japanese imperialism. As long as everyone can endure hardship, as long as everyone understands the true meaning of life, can adjust their personal living standards and desires, and at the same time contribute their strength and wealth to the country as much as possible, then, not to mention fighting the enemy for three to five years, even ten or eight years, or even a hundred years of war, China has the strength to sustain it! The problem is whether we can endure hardship and are willing to fight.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must use the Outline for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction as the only goal of our arduous struggle. A protracted war of resistance is originally an extremely difficult and arduous task, and what makes it difficult and arduous is not the War of Resistance itself, but the simultaneous advancement of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The Provisional National Congress of our party once stated this very clearly: "We should exert our best efforts to strive for the survival and independence of the country and the nation, and at the same time, based on the Three Principles of the People, continue to complete political and economic construction so that China can gain freedom and equality in the world. We also know that if China can have a peaceful environment at present, it will be easier to complete such construction. However, the invasion of Japanese imperialism is deepening, making peace hopeless. This War of Resistance is bound to happen and is unavoidable. We cannot hope to build in peace, but should carry out the War of Resistance and construction at the same time. Therefore, the responsibility for saving the country and the nation simultaneously falls on our shoulders." As for how to carry out the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the Three Principles of the People are our highest guiding principles, and the Outline for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction is our guiding principle. What we need to examine now is whether these construction outlines have been implemented, or how much of them have been implemented. What we need to strive for is how to develop wartime national construction work into a political and economic foundation for national revival after the war stops. For example, wartime state-owned trade and industrial and mining adjustments can achieve the goal of developing national capital and regulating private capital after the war; wartime political participation and military service systems can achieve the goals of democracy, local autonomy, and free conscription after the war. ... In short, in this process of fighting on the one hand and building the country on the other, we must not leave our outline at any time, and we must strive to realize the Three Principles of the People at all times.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, first, we firmly establish self-esteem and self-confidence in our own nation, and thus we have "something to rely on"! Second, we thoroughly understand the situation of the enemy and ourselves, and we are at ease, and thus we are "unshakable"! Third, we embrace the determination to sacrifice and fight to the end and engage in a protracted war with the enemy, and thus "the final victory" belongs to us! Fourth, we work hard based on a specific direction and goal, and thus we will not "collapse internally" during the war, and we can "revive" after the war! - This is our bright and splendid future! Everyone must catch up and complete our sacred mission!</p>

<h3>US Congress Reconvening Today, Roosevelt to Propose Important Bills to Strengthen Americas Defense and Amend Neutrality Act, Isolationists Still Plan to Obstruct but Influence is Diminished</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Congress is scheduled to convene this month for a profound discussion on foreign policy, the significance of which is unprecedented since the European War. According to preliminary observations, members of Congress will spend several months reviewing foreign policy and various issues, some of which relate to the situation in Europe and other dictatorships. President Roosevelt's proposals to increase national defense may be the most important bills that the new Senate and House of Representatives will discuss. The President has not yet announced his detailed plan, but the administrative departments have indicated that the President's program advocates a large increase in military strength, with emphasis on the Air Force. Recently, Secretary of War Johnson declared that the US Army Air Corps must double its strength, and perhaps even triple or quadruple it. Johnson also informally stated that the United States should have 7,000 to 10,000 military aircraft within four years. It is understood that the United States spent more than 10 billion US dollars on national defense last year. It is widely rumored that the total amount of this expenditure may increase to 15 billion US dollars in the fiscal year beginning July 1 this year. Some quarters in Washington have already declared that this expenditure is difficult to raise. Unless the White House and the various departments of national defense explain the reasons and purposes of the military build-up in detail, it will not be tolerated by the public. Various peace groups have also quickly informed several senators and representatives of their opposition to the President's large increase in armaments. The President's defense system is not only limited to the nation, but also a kind of continentalism, the purpose of which is to prevent any foreign country from gaining a foothold on the American continent. Some members of Congress certainly want to know the details of this move, how much it will cost, what achievements it will have in the future, and whether the Latin American countries fully understand and appreciate the US goals. As for the Neutrality Act, if the government proposes an amendment to allow the President to implement an arms embargo on one side of the belligerents, without having to implement this order on both sides of the belligerents or on all parties participating in the war, it can avoid countless legislative difficulties. The State Department does not admit that such a proposal is currently under consideration, but the claim that the government intends to make some amendments to the Neutrality Act is now rife, so this claim may not be without cause. Germany's anti-Jewish program and the influx of German Jews into the United States have raised the issue of whether immigration quotas should be revised. Some members of Congress advocate relaxing the German immigration quota so that more Jewish refugees can enter the country, but American labor groups and others strongly oppose this. Their intention is to ban immigration until the unemployment situation improves, so as to avoid robbing jobs. Several congressional leaders have expressed the view that any effort to change immigration quotas will be firmly opposed by both houses. The resolutions passed at the recent Pan-American Conference in the secret capital must be approved by the Senate, so the issue of the entire relationship between the United States and Latin America will also be discussed by Congress. Congress may ask government leaders to explain their interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, which has been in place for a century. According to this doctrine, Europe is not allowed to continue its colonial attempts on the American continent. Germany's economic and other activities in Latin America also seem to be a matter for Congress to discuss. The Panama Canal is a very important chain for American defense. Secretary of War Woodring recently advocated immediately strengthening the defense of the canal and making it indestructible. This move requires the appropriation of huge sums of money, and some advocate opening a secondary canal to strengthen defense. Others advocate that the United States should separate the Pacific Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet. All of this requires huge expenses and must be approved by Congress. Congress will also discuss the recently added Atlantic squadron, and whether the United States should weaken the Pacific Fleet and permanently establish this squadron, or continue to strengthen it. The reciprocal trade agreement recently concluded between the United Kingdom and the United States will be subject to a fierce debate in Congress, as there are many who support it, but there are also those who criticize it.

Since the war, the total amount of income tax revenue in 1920 has exceeded 3,000,000,000 gold yuan. (February 1 AP)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of Labor Perkins recently issued a New Year's message to workers across the country, explaining American industrial activity, stating that the amount of industrial and mining production has increased by 30% compared to a year ago, thereby reducing the number of unemployed and increasing the amount of wages paid. In the past five months, private industry has hired one million more workers, of which the manufacturing industry has been most positively affected. It is estimated that after the implementation of the low-cost housing construction plan, 800,000 construction workers and 1 million material handling workers can have jobs this year.

<h3>The French Budget is Passed by Congress, Three Rounds of Discussion Between the Senate and the House of Representatives</h3>

The House of Representatives made some modifications and passed the budget with 367 votes against 288 votes, and immediately sent it to the Senate, where it was finally approved by the Senate. It took less than 19 days from the proposal to the passage of this case, which is a new record for the rapid passage of the French budget in both houses. (February 2 Reuters)</p>
<h3>Germany Urgently Needs to Promote Foreign Trade, Deeply Afraid that South America Will Follow the UK and the US in Resisting Goods, Domestic Consumer Goods Workers are Lacking</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The characteristics of the German economy as of the end of 1938 are that although the public retains purchasing power, consumer goods are relatively lacking. Although the leaders of the National Socialist Party have repeatedly declared, "The foundation of the country lies in labor, not in gold. If foreign countries think that the current German system can be overthrown due to financial problems, they are very wrong," but in fact, the difficulties encountered by the German economy are due to labor problems. For example, in certain sectors, especially agriculture, construction, mining, and metallurgy, there is a shortage of workers and technicians, which affects the output of various consumer goods. In order to absorb unemployed workers, the National Socialist government increased many job opportunities starting in 1933. The total number of workers and employees in various industries, which was originally 12,000,000 in 1933, has increased to 21,000,000 last year. Among them, the agricultural sector even employs 120,000 foreign workers. Therefore, the shortage of labor in various industries is even more obvious. In addition, the German government is actively building defense works in the west, and the number of workers drawn from various industries is very large. When the government, the army, and the National Socialist Party order goods from various industries, they also order the UK to deliver the goods as soon as possible, so the shackles on the German economy are becoming heavier and heavier. The German authorities are now planning to replace manual labor with machines to remedy the situation, but in order to actively manufacture machines, the production of various consumer goods must retreat to a crucial position, and the balance is therefore broken in society. Although the number of workers has increased and their wages have increased, they only have money and cannot purchase various consumer goods, especially fats and textiles. This is the main crux of the German economy. In order to improve this situation, the German authorities have no intention of delaying the military preparations plan. Their only slogan is still "Better cannons than butter." At the same time, because they cannot increase taxes, which has aroused public resentment, they still have to persuade the people to spend their money through indirect methods, such as encouraging people to buy radios, save money to order "civilian cars," and participate in group travel. In addition, the issue of rewarding the export industry is also sufficient to hinder the normal development of the consumer goods manufacturing industry. Because German industry must export goods in exchange for raw materials that the country lacks, but the quantity of German exports decreased significantly last year. The German authorities are deeply afraid that in addition to the joint boycott of Germany by the United Kingdom and the United States, the countries of South America will be affected, which is extremely dangerous for the German economy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop foreign trade with all efforts and place the industries that are purely for domestic consumption in a crucial position. This is another reason for the insufficient application of civilian consumer goods. (February 1 Havas)</p>
<h3>Europe's Crisis Last Year, France Lost 7 Billion Francs</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government has submitted a bill to parliament regarding France's special expenditures during the European crisis in September last year, which amounted to 7,000,000,000 francs. (February 2 Haitong)</p>
<h3>Konoe is Running Around to Reorganize the Cabinet, Realization is Expected Around the 10th, All Parties are Closely Watching</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Political circles here have been paying close attention to Prime Minister Konoe's actions to strengthen the cabinet in recent days. On New Year's Day, Konoe spent the whole day at his Tokyo residence, first holding talks with Finance Minister Ikeda for two hours, and then holding talks with Cabinet Secretary General Kazami for two and a half hours. Afterwards, Konoe went to a seaside resort in Yokohama to visit Baron Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council, to solicit his opinion. Hiranuma said that he would return to Tokyo tomorrow. It is heard that Konoe hopes to strengthen the cabinet as soon as possible because the parliament will reopen soon. According to political observers, the change will be realized around January 10.

<h3>Foreign Minister of Hungary: Pro-German Policy Faces Widespread Opposition</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary - Foreign Minister Csáky of Hungary recently expressed his pro-German foreign policy stance in a semi-official statement published by the Hungarian Labor Exchange. This has drawn condemnation from most opposition newspapers and key conservative figures, such as former Prime Minister Gömbös and leader of the Smallholders Party, Eckhardt. They fear Hungary may become a German appendage. Gömbös published an article in the Budapest newspaper "Napló," addressing Germany's plan to support the Ukrainian independence movement, stating, "This is a reckless adventure fraught with crisis, marking the beginning of Slavic invasion into Central Europe. Regardless of its success, it poses a significant danger to Hungary's survival. We have pursued a pro-German policy for two decades, achieving nothing. Today, all thoughtful Hungarians are concerned about our country's future." Eckhardt, in an article in "Magyar Nemzet," argued that Hungarian foreign policy should completely change course and consider Western European countries. He stated, "Hungary has never been subservient to Germany, nor will it be in the future. Hungary's historical mission is to organize the Danube River basin and the Carpathian Mountains (located between the Czech Republic and Poland) are Hungary's natural boundaries, which we will never relinquish. It is true that Hungarian foreign policy should maintain friendship and cooperation with Germany, Italy, and Poland, but we must also consider the economic and financial power of Western European countries. For our country's sake, we should develop economic relations with Western European countries, Poland, and Southern Slavs, to maintain freedom of action with respect to Germany."

<h3>Anglo-German Naval Negotiations Cause Anxiety in British Public Opinion</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The newly built 26,000-ton battleship "Scharnhorst" has been completed and is scheduled to join the fleet on the 7th of this month. The German government already has one battleship of the same class, namely the "Gneisenau," and two 35,000-ton battleships under construction. Regarding 10,000-ton cruisers, according to the 1937 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Germany was originally allowed to build five. Of these, one, the "Prinz Eugen" (equipped with 200mm caliber guns), was launched last August. The "Blücher" and "Admiral Hipper" are nearing completion, and another is under construction. However, the German government, citing the Soviet Union's construction of seven 10,000-ton cruisers, is demanding that the number of Class A cruisers allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement be increased from five to seven. When the British naval delegation came to Berlin yesterday to hold talks with the German naval representatives, the German side raised this issue. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Since the German government requested to increase its submarine tonnage to be equal to that of the British submarines, and to increase the number of Class A cruisers from five to seven, British public opinion has become uneasy. Although the Foreign Office issued a communiqué the day before yesterday to reassure the public, it seemed to have little effect. Some newspapers even stated that if the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement is indeed revised, the British naval budget would have to be greatly increased. The Daily Telegraph reported, "The funds required for our country's air force expansion plan may have to be increased to £79,000,000. Now the German government also wants to increase its submarine tonnage to be on par with ours, then our existing destroyer and naval aircraft construction plans must also be expanded proportionally. In that case, the total expenditure required for our country's national defense plan for the next year may have to be increased to £120,000,000." The Daily Express was more optimistic, stating, "This German demand should not be taken seriously. The small submarine fleet built by that country is not considered a threat by Britain. Even German leader Hitler has no intention of challenging Britain on the high seas. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement remains effective in substance." The News Chronicle reported that the submarines built by Germany could, in wartime, control British communication lines in the Mediterranean Sea with greater power. "As such, although Germany has the right to request modifications to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Britain also has the right to reject Germany's construction of new submarines with greater power."

<h3>Chamberlain to Mediate Franco-Italian Dispute and to Visit the Pope to Request Mediation in the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the current relationship between France and Italy, although the French government has clearly stated that it does not want British mediation, according to information obtained here, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will still do his best to encourage British Prime Minister Chamberlain to convey Italy's demands to France. Sir Percy Loraine, the British Ambassador to Italy, has always advocated for negotiations on Italy's demands, even hinting that it would be dangerous if Britain refused to negotiate. Prime Minister Mussolini is therefore increasingly confident that once Prime Minister Chamberlain visits Rome, he can urge him to mediate. However, in light of the Laotian situation, the British government not only does not agree with Ambassador Loraine's views, but even believes that France's attitude is completely justified and skillful. After France refused mediation, Italy, in order to obtain decisive concessions, would first have to take the initiative to resume negotiations with Germany. People close to Prime Minister Chamberlain said that the Prime Minister, when visiting Rome, would not discuss the legitimacy of Italy's demands, but would only put forward some general views, namely: (1) Italy must first take the initiative and propose reasonable solutions to France; (2) If the issue of Italy's intervention in the Spanish Civil War can be resolved, France can adopt a more amenable attitude. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain's efforts are said to focus on the Spanish problem, meaning that the mediation of the Spanish Civil War is the key to the international situation. If this war can be ended, foreign intervention can be eliminated in one fell swoop. Even the policy of rapprochement between democratic countries and dictatorships can be continued and may find an answer. In this regard, Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Pope Pius XI during his visit to Italy is of great importance. There is no doubt that he will discuss the issue of mediation with the Pope.

<h3>Spanish War Rages On, Calls for Mediation Rise Again</h3>
<p>Barcelona - French Ambassador to the Spanish Republican Government, Henri, visited Prime Minister Negrín this afternoon to discuss the general international situation. (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>San Sebastián - According to well-informed sources here, since the arrival of the new French Ambassador to Spain, Henri, the work of "democratizing" the Spanish government has been revitalized. The French ambassador's work is clearly aimed at achieving mediation in the Spanish conflict through the "democratization" of the Spanish government. Based on the phenomena expressed by various parties, it is speculated that the instructions received by the French ambassador and the British chargé d'affaires are similar, both striving to mediate at the request of the Spanish government. At the same time, the Spanish government is also seeking reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church, seemingly intending to invite Archbishop D'Acosta to mediate. National Army personnel have stated that no matter in what way the government forces conduct mediation, it will inevitably be rejected by the Spanish National Army. (Haitong Press Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) According to reports from Reuters correspondents accompanying the government forces and the National Army on the central front, the government forces continue to exert significant pressure on the National Army troops attacking Catalonia. According to sources in Barcelona, Italian army divisions are currently attacking the town of Viniols, located between Lleida and Tarragona. The government's defensive forces in the machine gun emplacements in the mountains of that area are subjected to intense artillery fire and air raids daily and have been forced to gradually abandon their strongholds. However, the government forces often carry out flanking attacks at night to recover lost territory. It is reported that there is extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat in this battle. According to government forces, the National Army's advance has suffered great sacrifices and has not yet proven that this move poses any danger to the government militarily. According to a battle report from Burgos, there is fighting on the Catalan, Madrid, and Valencia fronts. According to the Spanish News Agency, there is a fierce battle on the Valencia front, and it is acknowledged that the village of Castillos de Villamalefa near Val de Uxo has fallen.

<h3>French Prime Minister Daladier Arrives in Corsica by Ship, Says France Has Ample Self-Defense Capabilities, Italy to Economically Boycott French Territories</h3>
<p>Ajaccio - Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier arrived here this morning. The Class A cruiser "Suffren" had sailed into the port since early morning, escorted by a squadron of seaplanes. The Class A cruisers "Colbert" and "Foch," on which Prime Minister Daladier was traveling, and three Class B cruisers and three destroyers, then entered the port. At that time, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, along with former cabinet members Pietri and Landry (both Corsicans), members of both houses of parliament elected from the island of Fezzan, disembarked from the "Suffren." Residents of the port also welcomed them. Prime Minister Daladier then boarded a small boat from the "Foch" at 8:00 AM, amid a cannon salute, and disembarked, immediately leading Army Chief of Staff General Georges, Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Darlan, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Vuillemin to lay a wreath at the war memorial for officers and soldiers who died in the European War. After reviewing the army troops, he went to the Governor's Office. At that time, the Chairman of the Provincial Council, Rocca Serra, delivered a welcoming speech, saying that Corsica is loyal and unwavering. Prime Minister Daladier then went to the City Hall to attend a reception and deliver a speech, which concluded with the words, "France does not need to engage in aggression, nor does it threaten any country. It only needs to maintain sufficient strength, and it already has sufficient strength, which is enough. This is what you can firmly believe, and it is what I want to tell you. Once the naval fleet has circled the island of Corsica, I want every shepherd and fisherman on the island to feel safe. This fleet is the embodiment of France's strength and its affection for Corsica." (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Gibraltar - News has just been received here that, except for the central points, most of Abyssinia has not surrendered to Italy, and due to the lack of cash, the economic situation is extremely depressed. The economic life of this port is being boycotted, and transshipment merchants have been notified to quickly transport Italian goods to Abyssinia. The Italian Consul General stationed here has also left for home. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Poland Receives Imperial Russian Royal Jewels</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Most of the treasures of the former Russian royal family were taken into custody by the Polish government yesterday. The valuable pearls and jewels include the crown of Nicholas I, the diamond necklace and pearl ring of Empress Feodorovna, and the crown of Alexander II, with a total value of 15,000,000 gold rubles. These treasures were previously stored in the vaults of the Polish National Bank. Article in the Treaty of Riga signed by Poland and the Soviet Union in 1921, Russia agreed to return Polish national treasures and pearls seized before the war. These treasures were collected during the Polish Revolution in 1830, worth 30,000,000 gold rubles. In 1923, because the Soviet Union did not return them, Poland agreed to use the Romanov treasures as compensation, but the Soviet government had the right to redeem them within fifteen years. The term expired at the end of December 1938, so they are now returned to the Polish national permanent custody. (Haitong Press Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Observations on the Way Back to Shanghai from Changsha via Ji'an: People's Efforts in Industrial Cooperation Seek to Solve the Refugee Problem</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that the following is extracted from the notes of a traveler who recently returned to Shanghai from near Changsha, describing the efforts of the Chinese government and the people to organize 30,000 industrial cooperatives to solve the refugee problem and revive the country.</p>
<p>As night fell, the train left Changsha and headed east for Jinhua, two or three days' journey away. As we left, we saw hundreds of male and female laborers clearing the rubble from the streets and collecting debris among the ruins. Changsha originally had a population of 500,000, of course, most of whom had fled. The carriages were full of passengers and luggage, very few of whom were originally residents of Changsha, returning to inspect their property, knowing very well that they could not stay, so they took the train elsewhere. But it was unclear why they were heading east, as most refugees were heading west. Traveling south along the Yuehan Railway from near Changsha, Shaoyang in southwestern Hunan was a gathering place, as it was the terminus of long-distance buses and a refugee center. The train did not reach Nanchang, but stopped at Zhangshu, 45 miles south of Nanchang, across the Gan River. I left the train to undergo the usual inspection of luggage and documents. There is often fear of spies in Zhangshu, so the inspectors paid special attention to maps and photographs. From Zhangshu, I took a long-distance bus south to Ji'an to meet with several merchants. The highway winds through the steep mountains of the Gan River basin. In the summer, this is a rice and tea producing area, but now it is planted with beans and wheat. There are people walking everywhere, mostly refugee groups from the Yangtze River basin, resting by the highway, or traveling by rickshaw or wheelbarrow, or collapsing on the road. Ji'an is now quite prosperous. A tea merchant described how the authorities care for the refugees, saying that two weeks ago, one Chinese and one foreigner went to Ji'an to post notices about industrial cooperatives and recruit workers. The local people had been unable to transport their tea, ramie cloth, and other goods out of Nanchang and Jiujiang, so they and a large number of refugees were overjoyed to hear this. After the notice was posted, many people applied. After interviews, the cooperative office began to provide loans and start work. Soon, I went to a small street office to inquire and met the two people leading this movement. Although they were extremely busy, they were still very welcoming, inviting me to dinner and letting me stay overnight, as the long-distance bus back to Zhangshu was canceled that day. The foreigner was Mr. Hallcombe, and the Chinese was Ms. Li Wanpei (transliteration). Both had worked as engineers in Guangzhou and were invited by the Industrial Cooperative Association to serve in the cooperative. We ate Chinese food, and during the meal, the two talked enthusiastically about the progress of their work, starting the necessary industries in this rich and backward province of Jiangxi. They are working closely with the Jiangxi Refugee Relief Joint Association and the Rural Reconstruction Bureau to designate the area south of Taihe as a refugee reclamation area. But the current need is only a small part of agricultural production. With the outside supply sources for the people of this area now cut off, there is an urgent need for a large number of goods. To meet this need, the industrial cooperative movement has begun. The people can all work, and there are many who need goods. Because there are a large number of raw materials in the area, and resources have not yet been exploited, this movement is very smooth. According to Mr. Hallcombe, the area is quite rich, but the people are conservative. Iron, coal, lead, zinc, manganese, tungsten, silver, gold, antimony, ramie, and tobacco are all produced, but machinery is lacking. I asked what progress had been made so far. Mr. Hallcombe said that since August 1938, there have been four general headquarters and more than 100 cooperatives. The plan is to develop local resources as much as possible. Because transportation is inconvenient, the Ji'an Cooperative has started to manufacture straw sandals, boats, matches, paper, oil extracted from tea and plant seeds, and fine cloth woven from ramie and cotton. After dinner, the three of us went to the general office and visited a cooperative workshop that manufactured small boats. The workshop was on the riverbank, with 30 workers manufacturing sampans. The foreman was an experienced shipbuilder, formerly in Hangzhou, now leading workers to manufacture here. The Ji'an office loaned this foreman 850 yuan, with a one-year term, which he used to buy wood and start building ships. Because river transport is prosperous, there is a great need for ships. The proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses, are divided among the workers, so the workers work very hard. In the afternoon, I took a tour of the countryside in the mountains. The villages were all very quiet and had not yet revealed the horror of war. The local farmers said that the war was still far away from here. If the Japanese army arrives here, they will rise up to resist. The next morning, I took a long-distance bus north back to Zhangshu, which is now very busy with military defense and railway transportation. From Zhangshu, I took a small train to Jinhua, which has now been changed to the provincial capital of Zhejiang Province. Various government offices are now located there. From there, I took a long-distance bus and small boat circuitously to Ningbo, and then took a boat back to Shanghai. The six-day journey was thus concluded.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Catholic Magazine Viciously Criticizes Japanese Army's Arbitrary Actions: Neither Like Disciplined Soldiers nor Civilized People</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Hong Kong Catholic magazine "The Rock" viciously criticizes the Japanese army's arbitrary actions during the southern invasion. It is reported that the fighting outside the Hong Kong border is not as barbaric as it was a year ago. This is certainly pleasing, but this means that the Japanese army is no longer stabbing unarmed civilians in the streets, and the number of women being raped is not as high as in the past when bombing cities and towns with airplanes, artillery from the sea or mountain peaks, machine guns from tanks, and throwing grenades. Today, the level of war has reached the point where we have become accustomed to the barbaric acts in this war, and we are no longer shocked unless there is a mass slaughter. The villages of Guangdong Province are often completely destroyed because the Japanese soldiers force the people to burn their homes to the ground for their amusement. If a Japanese soldier is shot by someone, they will kill hundreds of civilians in retaliation. If the war in Guangdong can be taken as an example of the entire war in China, then this kind of war not only completely disregards the conventions of civilized warfare, but also, from the phenomenon, there is no distinction between a civilized army and a group of barbarians. The people who fled from the war zone into Hong Kong have recounted the terrors of war they experienced, saying that even if there were no Chinese soldiers in the entire area, they would still be swept by machine gun fire, regardless of civilian lives, and that there was no way to save one's own life except by selling out one's compatriots. Judging from the actions of the invading army, they are truly fond of slaughter and destruction, and are neither like disciplined soldiers nor like civilized people. This is the final blow to Japan's reputation in Hong Kong. Even Japan's best friends no longer defend the actions of the Japanese army and its leaders, because after careful consideration of humanity, they have had to change their attitude. But the war in South China is not as shocking as the war in North China, which has shocked the world. There are also some events in the war in South China that are extremely shocking and would be almost unbelievable if they were not personally spoken of by absolutely reliable eyewitnesses. For example, one town, because it had no adequate means of defense, decided not to resist, but the Japanese army would only not harass the town under certain conditions, one of which was that the town provide a certain number of women. The town was unwilling to accept this condition, as would any other town in China, any town of a nation that had not lost its sense of shame, so it resisted until the town was completely destroyed. But this is only one of many unforgettable events. There is also ironclad evidence of the destruction of churches and church property. We have heard news from the Hong Kong border that when the Japanese army occupied a certain number of houses, they cleaned out the excrement in the houses when they left, making them cleaner than before the occupation. But this was intentionally done by the Japanese army to win the praise of foreign eyewitnesses. This has never happened where newspaper reporters have not set foot. In the guerrilla areas of Guangdong, a total of 20 Catholic churches and other buildings have been destroyed. Some churches were in a state similar to pigsties after the Japanese army left. In other churches, the barbarity and thoroughness with which the Japanese army desecrated sacred objects was unmatched. But more painful than the actions of the invading army is the memory left in the minds of the large number of refugees. We still remember this memory vividly. These people were clearly in a hurry to carry a few items, preferring to flee for their lives rather than fall into the hands of the Japanese army. Most of them did not flee from towns that were about to become battlefields, but from undefended rural areas, and all had indescribable terror, which came with the footsteps of the infamous army. If we consider these things to be ordinary events in today's war, then civilization itself is in danger.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful Attack by Japanese Troops on Chongde; Chinese Patriots Fight Heroically, Killing Over a Hundred Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Chongde Correspondence) Since our county fell into enemy hands last year and became a guerrilla zone, patriotic people from towns, markets, villages, and hamlets within the county have all left their homes to join the army and fight the enemy. Consequently, the strength of the guerrilla forces in the area has steadily increased, and the Japanese troops no longer dare to venture out and ravage the countryside. The villagers have thus enjoyed peace and quiet. Furthermore, the Chinese army maintains strict discipline, so the people not only deeply respect them but are also happy to assist in their work. This truly represents the best example of military-civilian cooperation in the war of resistance. Unfortunately, in the middle of last month, a key base of our Chinese army was discovered by a traitor, who then secretly reported all the details to the Japanese authorities. Due to their limited strength, the Japanese did not dare to attack, so no fighting was heard there until the beginning of this month. It was then decided that the Chinese army would launch a full-scale offensive. Therefore, a large number of reinforcements were transferred from the eastern Zhejiang area and distributed to various locations. After these reinforcements – divisions, brigades, and regiments – arrived, a traitor again secretly reported to the Japanese. Fearing that the Chinese army's lines of communication would be established in the future and that their strength would be difficult to eliminate, the Japanese immediately mobilized a large force from Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places. They also ordered Xu Pucheng, the "Jiangsu-Zhejiang Pacification Commander," to quickly send his puppet troops to the county to join the local Japanese troops. They advanced along both land and water routes and many Japanese and puppet soldiers were sent from Tongxiang to jointly besiege the Chinese army's positions. However, the Chinese army had received a secret report in advance and had already dug zigzagging trenches more than ten miles long around the base. They had also piled up a large number of sandbags and other materials. Thus, when the Japanese troops had not yet reached the Lujiaqiao area, the Chinese army launched a head-on attack. The Japanese soldiers hastily responded and once attempted to attack the Chinese defensive works with artillery fire, but all shots missed. Later, as the Chinese soldiers fought more and more bravely, disregarding sacrifice, they leaped out of the trenches under heavy artillery fire and stormed the Japanese, completely defeating the enemy troops. Just as the Chinese army was celebrating its victory, a burst of gunfire suddenly erupted from behind. It turned out that the Japanese troops were attacking from the rear, attempting to encircle us. At that time, for strategic reasons, the Chinese army temporarily retreated to the Majiayang area. Unexpectedly, the Japanese troops pursued, and the Chinese forces had no choice but to fight back fiercely. It is said that after four hours of intense fighting, the Chinese forces, with their superior strength and the dedication of their soldiers, finally routed all six or seven hundred Japanese soldiers, who scattered and fled in all directions. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and over two hundred rifles, countless bullets, and six or seven hundred pieces of military clothing and blankets were captured.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Fall of Hangzhou: Tragedy Strikes a Theater Performance in Lishui; Collapsed Building Kills and Injures Over Eighty People</h3>
<p>Lishui Correspondence: All sectors of Lishui held a solemn commemoration on the 24th, the one-year anniversary of the fall of Hangzhou. At 7 p.m. that evening, a theatrical performance was held at Wenchang Pavilion for propaganda purposes. Over three thousand people attended. After the opening ceremony, County Magistrate Zhu Zhangbao delivered a speech. Just as the curtain was about to rise for the performance, a violent explosion occurred from the backstage upstairs. The dressing room had suddenly collapsed, and the actors fell into the debris of broken tiles and rafters. The audience, unaware of the true situation, panicked and lost all order. Although there were seven steps, each five feet high, in front of the gate, the crowd, in a state of terror, scrambled to escape, resulting in a pile-up of people falling on top of each other. Those who followed trampled over them. At that moment, the chaotic sounds of people shouting and crying merged into one, ultimately leading to a tragedy. Most of the deaths and injuries were caused by trampling. By midnight, twenty-two deaths had been confirmed, and fifteen bodies had been claimed by their families. Seven bodies remained unclaimed. Over sixty people were injured and were sent to the rescue team and Fumin Hospital, both of which were full. The daughter of Education Director Xu Shaodi and the daughter of Chuzhong Principal Zhao Zhongsu, who were also participating in the performance, suffered minor injuries. Yu Zixian, the director of the Chuzhong Affiliated Elementary School, was seriously injured while tending to the backstage.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Refugees Cultivating Land in the Snow; Xiang-Gan University Prefigures a Bountiful Harvest</h3>
<p>According to someone who recently traveled from Xiang-Gan (Hunan-Jiangxi) through Zhejiang to Shanghai, the people in the areas where our troops are stationed are increasingly supportive of the war of resistance. The military and government authorities are both fighting the war and building a prosperous society, which is very encouraging. In early this month, it snowed heavily in various counties of southern Hunan and northern Jiangxi. After the winter plowing was completed, the people welcomed this auspicious snow, all hoping for a bountiful harvest next year. Agricultural development has not been hindered by the war, which is a good sign for the future of the war of resistance. Many counties bordering Zhejiang and Jiangxi have also experienced snowfall. The refugees are the ones suffering the most, but they are still able to endure hardship and work hard for the final victory of the war of resistance. Over ten thousand refugees have been moved from the war zone to Xiang-Gan to cultivate land. They work diligently all day long without complaint. However, most of these people fled in the spring and summer, and now they lack cotton clothing in this severe cold. Therefore, they hope that people from all over can donate as much cold-weather clothing and leather clothing as possible. Transportation from Hunan to Jiangxi and from Jiangxi to Zhejiang is as smooth as usual. After passing through Jinhua in Zhejiang, transportation becomes slightly more difficult because that area is closer to the front lines. However, ordinary merchants, women, and children can still pass through without obstruction. The import and export trade in the inland areas is quite prosperous. Japanese goods have completely disappeared. If the people in the occupied areas could also unanimously use only domestic goods, that would be the only benefit for China after the Sino-Japanese War. What we saw along the way filled us with good feelings and can be used to comfort our countrymen.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Appears in Guangzhou; Peng Dongyuan and Lü Chunrong Serve as Puppet Chairmen; Guangzhou Has Become a Dead City, But Gambling and Opium are Thriving</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: At the beginning of the fall of Guangzhou, a puppet organization called the "Guangzhou Women's Maintenance Association" appeared, presided over by two female traitors. One was a former female clerk in the Guangzhou Local Court, and the other was a well-known female gangster. However, for more than a month, this puppet organization has not achieved any special results and is disliked by the Japanese. Therefore, personnel from the Japanese special service organs have been running around trying to gather support, and now another puppet "Guangzhou Public Security Maintenance Committee" has appeared. This puppet organization has Peng Dongyuan as the puppet chairman, Lü Chunrong as the puppet vice-chairman, and a certain Chen as the secretary-general. A certain Shang, a certain Liang, a certain Liao, and a certain Zhuo are the committee members. Liang and Liao are unknown. Shang was a lawyer, and Zhuo is the son of a businessman. This group of traitors held a ceremony on the 20th of December at noon at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to assume their puppet posts. There were more Japanese military and government representatives present than there were traitors. Peng and Lü delivered speeches one after another, and the Japanese representatives also took the stage to lecture. In addition, so-called "citizen representatives" also took the stage to sing praises. Finally, the puppet secretary-general, Chen, led the chanting of slogans, and the ceremony concluded. The slogans were strange and absurd: (1) China and Japan are good friends, (2) Long live the new government, (3) Long live the public security maintenance committee.</p>
<p>When the members of the puppet Public Security Maintenance Committee took their puppet posts, the Japanese and traitors sent people to the Changdi Henan area to buy a large number of beggars to line up and assemble in the open square outside the Zhongshan Memorial Hall to shout slogans in order to decorate the facade. At that time, the scene outside the Memorial Hall was filled with people with crooked heads, limping feet, patched clothes, and dirty faces, looking extremely ugly. Unexpectedly, just as the puppet ceremony was underway, a commotion suddenly broke out in the crowd of beggars. The puppet organization recruited beggars and paid each person a salary of three corners, but those who were responsible for the recruitment took the opportunity to embezzle the money, giving two corners, one and a half corners, or one corner, with varying prices. After they inquired with each other, those who only received one or two corners all protested. The Japanese troops, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately sealed off the square with bayonets, and a group of beggars had no way to disperse. When the puppet ceremony ended, they marched through the city under the leadership of small traitors. As a result, Japanese and traitor newspapers advertised "Celebrating the establishment of the new government of Guangzhou, 30,000 citizens enthusiastically paraded."</p>
<p>After Guangzhou was occupied, the scene was extremely desolate. According to a certain missionary who had just arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago on a British gunboat, although the traitors in Guangzhou were very active, posting notices everywhere, carrying out propaganda, and attracting refugees to return home to live, and sending representatives to Hong Kong to promote their activities and issue so-called "passes" to persuade people fleeing Hong Kong to return to Guangzhou as soon as possible, the results were completely ineffective. Moreover, the city lacked food, fuel, vegetables, and drinking water. Due to the robberies by traitors, most of the residents who had not yet escaped were trying to find a chance to escape, and those who had already fled would not dare to return easily, throwing themselves into the net. As for the Japanese side, they had recently brought four or five hundred overseas Chinese men and women on transport ships, most of whom were vagrants and prostitutes. After arriving, they originally wanted to open brothels, teahouses, cafes, etc., but the city was deserted day and night, and the Japanese troops were frequently deployed and moved about hastily. This made it impossible for them to open for business and have customers. Therefore, the Japanese merchants and prostitutes who wanted to go to the province to do business were greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops arrived in Guangzhou, they incited vagrants and traitors to sell drugs and open gambling houses very actively. At present, it is impossible to accurately estimate the prevalence of opium and red pills in Guangzhou. These large quantities of drugs were transported into the Pearl River by Japanese warships along with guns, ammunition, and bombs, and were sold by the pacification teams. Up to now, 50 red pill shops and 40 opium shops have been opened in the city, and there are more than 30 others being prepared but not yet officially opened. In addition, there are 70 or 80 other informal selling and smoking places, so the daily consumption of drugs is quite alarming. As for the gambling houses, now that the puppet maintenance association has appeared, the traitors' funding has not yet been secured, so the large-scale gambling business is likely to be restored. It is also rumored that Peng Dongyuan, in order to promote the policy of enslavement, is planning to actively develop the opium and gambling industries to the nearby occupied areas in order to increase revenue.</p>
<h3>Puppet Hangzhou City Government Anxiously Seeks to Restore the Market at the City Railway Station, But Fails; Holds a Korean Product Exhibition; Chinese Patriots Seize the Opportunity to Assassinate Puppets</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Correspondence) After the city of Hangzhou fell last year, shops in all districts stopped their business, leading to deserted and desolate roads. Since the establishment of the puppet city government, the Japanese have repeatedly ordered the resumption of commerce and ordered residents to move back within a limited time. Those who procrastinated or hesitated would have their houses confiscated. Therefore, some of the population was forced to move back to live and, in order to maintain a living, opened small shops and stalls (mostly restaurants, taverns, teahouses, and tobacco shops) only in the sections around Qixia San Yuan Fang, Yanling Road, and Yingzi Road. The areas around the railway station, because they are close to the railway and important transportation routes, often experience fighting. Therefore, no one lives there to this day, making it desolate and lonely, completely different from the human world. Recently, the Japanese, under the pretext of restoring the market in order to use fake Chinese as a shield to reduce the attacks by the Chinese army (because the Chinese army is extremely protective of the common people; if a place has many residents, they will often reduce attacks to avoid the tragic deaths of civilians), ordered the puppet city government to fully revive the commercial market in that area. The puppet mayor, He Zhan, repeatedly consulted with Yishi Longshou, the section chief of the special service organ, and decided to first force the residents to move back and establish a City Railway Station Restoration Management Office, appointing Chen Keli as the puppet director. The puppet office has three sections: business, engineering, and general affairs. It is now known that the office has delineated the area east to Lingzhi Road and south to Yangshi Street, forcing the owners to repair their houses and forcibly conscripting laborers to organize transportation and repair roads. All materials are taken from the plundered civilian factories. It is said that although the project has been completed, no one has moved to the area to open a shop, causing the puppet mayor great anxiety. Therefore, he consulted with the Japanese again, and as a result, they decided to use economic incentives and promulgated ninety-two loan rules. The intention on the surface is to assist commerce, but in reality, it is to exploit the common people. Therefore, when the people first heard that the city government had loans to assist in the restoration of businesses, they all rushed to get application forms. However, after reading the restrictive rules, they realized that it was nothing more than an open loan sharking institution, so they were unwilling to take out loans and go there to operate. Moreover, it is said that the funds designated for the people are all Japanese military scrip.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) In order to carry out economic aggression and absorb our country's economy, the Japanese recently opened a Korean product exhibition at the former National Goods Exhibition Hall in Hangzhou. All the exhibits, such as the aquatic products from the Jeolla Buk-do Fisheries Association, the Korean paper sandals from Gyeongsang Buk-do, the various medicinal materials and plywood from the Daegu Fisheries and Pharmaceutical Association, and bicycles and materials, etc., have been exhibited, but since the opening, apart from the officials of the puppet organization who have visited, our people have suffered deeply from the Japanese and are all united in their hatred of the enemy. Therefore, they are unwilling to buy these smuggled goods. As a result, from the opening to the closing, the event has been extremely deserted and desolate. It is said that the puppet provincial and city mayors Zai Ruikai and He Zhan all participated in the ceremony on the opening day, and our Chinese patriotic soldiers seized the opportunity to mingle among the traitors and fired more than ten shots in a row. The order was chaotic for a time, and the Japanese and puppet personnel all scrambled to escape. At that time, our soldiers were able to retreat safely in the chaos. After the puppet police received the news and rushed to the museum to investigate, the puppet provincial governor, Cheng Bu, was slightly injured, Xie Huchen's right arm was hit by a bullet, and He Zhan fell to the ground uninjured in shock. The police immediately called ambulances to send the wounded to the hospital for treatment and announced a temporary curfew, conducting a major search in the surrounding area, but with no results. Since then, the puppet provincial governor and others have been living in seclusion. When going to the puppet office, they must travel in their own cars, and declare a curfew on the roads they pass, cutting off pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Construction Secretary Qiu Yuanxiong Detained for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Suspended from Duty and Placed Under Supervision Pending Investigation. Wenzhou Correspondence: The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, believing that Wenzhou is located on the coast and is an important trading port in the province after the war of resistance, and that industry and commerce are very prosperous there, felt that factories should be relocated inland as soon as possible to avoid being destroyed by the enemy during this time of intense war. Therefore, on August 1, the Wenzhou Factory Relocation Committee was established, with the chairmen of the various trade associations in Wenzhou as members, and the department secretary Qiu Yuanxiong was appointed as the director, responsible for presiding over the relocation. There were originally 22 iron factories, 19 printing factories, 34 sawmills, 26 rice mills, 8 dyeing and weaving factories, Puming Electric Plant, Dongou Telephone Company, Guangming Match Factory, Baihao Milk Company, Taohua Food Company, and several other factories in Wenzhou. Since the start of the relocation, most of them have been relocated. Those that have been moved inland (including 15 iron factories, 9 dyeing and weaving factories, and many sawmills) will be purchased by the government, and the government will set a price and submit it to the province for approval. They are preparing to organize a valuation committee, but for months, this has not been implemented, and merchants and civilians feel quite distressed. Recently, the Military Discipline Inspection Group of the Military Affairs Commission has received secret reports that Qiu Yuanxiong has used his position in the relocation committee to extort large sums of money from companies and factories (it is said that he asked a certain milk company for 5,000 yuan, and other companies for 300-500 yuan). Those who paid were allowed to temporarily postpone the relocation. Later, Provincial Chairman Huang heard about this and summoned Qiu Yuanxiong (Qiu usually resides at the Bank of China in Wenzhou) to the department at 8 p.m. on the 13th via long-distance telephone to Xu Zongwu, the 8th District Commissioner and Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander, and had him detained. At the same time, he telegraphed the Construction Department to suspend Qiu from his duties pending investigation. It was also investigated that Qiu, while serving as the county magistrate of Pinghu County last year, took the opportunity to embezzle 20,000 yuan of public funds in November when our troops in western Zhejiang were transferred. Afterwards, Kang Saiqi, the director of the county treasury, returned to the province and reported him (Kang was given 2,000 yuan by Qiu and has already turned it over to the provincial treasury; the accounting director received 1,000 yuan, but his whereabouts are unknown). It is said that Qiu later admitted to paying back part of the money, but it has not yet been cleared. This case is still under investigation, and it is feared that if both crimes are revealed, Qiu will not be able to escape the law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Invaders in China Show All Signs of Distress; Japanese Troops in Zhenjiang Haven't Been Paid for Months; Japanese Troops in Rugao Are Internally Hollow; Japanese Troops Harassing Shatou Were Annihilated</h3>
<p>Taixian Special Dispatch: Someone recently came to Taixian from Zhenjiang and talked about the Japanese troops in Zhenjiang, who are experiencing economic panic and have not been paid for several months, so the market has also been affected. Because each Japanese soldier's pockets are empty, they are not as wealthy as before, and they all show signs of distress. No one passes through the Wangjinqiao area in the city after 7 p.m. every night, because even if one carries hundreds of coins, they will be taken away by the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Rugao now number about 600, but half of them are Zhuangding (strong young men) drawn from various parts of southern Jiangsu. They are stationed inside and outside the city, also wearing Japanese military uniforms, but they have no guns in their hands. The internal hollowness of the troops can be seen from this. On the morning of the 22nd, four Japanese soldiers were suddenly discovered in Shatou Town, Jiangbei, on a small motorboat, attempting to harass the town. They were all annihilated by the Chinese guerrilla forces, and the small motorboat was captured.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Civil Servants' Living Expenses; Standards of Payment; Increased by 30% to 50% Compared to a Year Ago</h3>
<p>(Jinhua Correspondence) Since the provincial government moved east at the end of last year, the living expenses of civil servants in the provincial agencies have been reduced to the minimum due to financial difficulties. A year has now passed. Since the provincial finances have been reorganized and tax revenues have gradually increased, and after repeated requests from various parties, the 1031st meeting of the provincial government on December 13 passed an amendment to the standards for wartime civil servants' living expenses, increasing them by 30% to 50% compared to before.

<h3>Development of Inter-Provincial Transportation in Fujian</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The economic hub of Fujian Province has now shifted from the coast to the interior. In order to develop inter-provincial trade, the authorities have planned to launch joint transportation between Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. Joint transportation between Fujian and Zhejiang has already been implemented, and the connecting point is the Jiangpu section, that is, from Jiangshan County in Zhejiang Province to Pucheng County in Fujian Province. The business is quite developed. Joint transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi has also been launched this month, starting from Yanping in Fujian Province and ending in Nanchang in Jiangxi Province. There is one direct train every day, and there is no need to change trains or tickets in the middle. It takes two days to arrive. If you take a steamboat from Fuzhou to Yanping, and then take a car from Yanping to Nanchang, it will take three days to arrive. Transportation is extremely convenient. Therefore, the Postal Administration has recently transferred the mail from foreign countries to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces through Fuzhou in order to be nimble. Currently, this route is first used for passenger transport, and freight transport will be launched next year. The highway freight rates in this province are also lower than in other provinces. For example, the average freight rate per 50 kilograms per kilometer is six cents in other provinces, but only four cents or three and a half cents, or even three cents in Fujian. The freight rate for native products is as low as two and a half cents or two cents, and the freight rate for food is even lower, only one and a half cents per 50 kilograms per kilometer. In addition, the number of bus trips on the Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou line and the Yanping-Shaxian-Yongan line has been increased. The telephone lines on the Yongchun-Dehua-Datian line have been completed, and the roadbeds and pavements on the Yongan-Liancheng-Changting line have also been improved. The Yongan station and vehicle factory have begun construction, and the station buildings in Sanyuan and Xinkou in Shaxian and Gongzhou and Hongtian in Liancheng will be completed soon. In recent months, the highway operating income of the entire province has increased to more than 180,000 yuan per month after the rectification. Although the costs have increased (gasoline has increased from 1.14 yuan per gallon to 1.81 yuan per gallon, and tires have increased from 80 yuan each to 180 yuan), the most prosperous highway line from Quanzhou to Xiamen, although destroyed after the fall of Xiamen, still has a slight surplus after offsetting income and expenses. The supply of materials and oil has also been fully stocked, which is sufficient for use. In addition, the import and export trade in Fuzhou has been booming recently. The major export goods are timber, fruits, paper, and sugar, and the import goods are not only for the province's own use but are also transshipped to Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. There has been frequent traffic of foreign ships between Shanghai and Fuzhou recently, and most merchants engaged in the import and export business have made profits. It is expected that the New Year will pass smoothly for the commercial and financial sectors. (December 23)</p>
<h3>Zhangjiagang; Still Difficult to Stop Overseas Ships; Report of Bombing of Taizixu Port Is Untrue</h3>
<p>Changyinsha Correspondence: Since the suspension of navigation at Zhangjiagang, all overseas merchant ships have changed to stopping at Taizixu Port and Hucao Port. However, the transportation of passengers and goods is not as convenient as at Zhangjiagang. Moreover, due to the low water level in winter, the sandy beaches are wide, making transshipment difficult. The overseas shipping companies and the internal port transshipment companies recently held a meeting to discuss resuming stops at Zhangjiagang. However, because Japanese troops are stationed there, there are many obstacles. Although several rounds of negotiations have been held and some progress has been made, it will still take some time before Zhangjiagang is officially restored, and it is unlikely to happen in the near future. Taizixu Port has been very peaceful recently, and there has been no shelling incident. Only the internal ports, such as Hucao Port, have 30 to 40 Japanese puppet troops stationed there, causing unrest among the local residents.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Under the Administration of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office</h3>
<p>— Xuan Nan</p>
<p>On February 1st of the 14th year of the Republic of China, Han Guojun, the Governor of Jiangsu Province, decided to establish Shanghai as a special municipality. He telegraphed and appointed Li Zhongjue, the head of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and ten others as preparatory committee members to discuss and decide on the name "Songhu Special Municipality" and to discuss the area of the special municipality. In early June, Duan Qirui, the Chief Executive, specially appointed Sun Baoqi as the Director督辦 of the Songhu Municipal Area, with Yu Hede and Li Zhongjue as Assistant Directors會辦. However, although the order was issued, Sun Baoqi did not take office, and the special municipality proposal was shelved. The following year, the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu Governor, Sun Chuanfang, organized the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office. On May 3rd, Sun Chuanfang arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, and the next day announced the establishment of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office. Sun Chuanfang held an inauguration ceremony as Director督辦, and promulgated thirteen articles of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office's organizational outline, the main seven of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office manages administrative, diplomatic, security, and other affairs within the Songhu Commercial Port area, and supervises local autonomous affairs within the commercial port.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office shall have one Director督辦, concurrently held by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, who shall be responsible for all political affairs; and one Director-General總辦, appointed by the Commander-in-Chief, who shall report to the Director督辦, supervise and guide all staff of the office, and execute the duties of the office. When the Director督辦 is not in the office, the Director-General總辦 may act on his behalf. However, in the event of important matters, instructions must still be sought for handling.</p>
<p>Article 6: The Foreign Affairs Department handles all foreign affairs within the commercial port area.</p>
<p>Article 7: The Political Affairs Department handles all administrative affairs within the commercial port area.</p>
<p>Article 8: The Security Department handles all public security and hygiene affairs within the commercial port area.</p>
<p>Article 9: The Public Works Department handles port affairs, roads, bridges, waterways, and civil engineering affairs of municipal autonomy in public construction within the commercial port area.</p>
<p>Article 10: The Finance Department handles the income and expenditure affairs of the office and the commercial port area. When Sun Chuanfang took office, he stated: "After the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war last year, the overall situation in the Southeast has temporarily calmed down, but the Songhu issue urgently needs to be resolved. The former government had a proposal to designate Songhu as a special zone, but it has not yet become a reality, and the people have been longing for it for a long time. Now that Jiangsu and Zhejiang have become one family, the opening of Songhu as a commercial port is even more urgent. Therefore, I have started organizing it and announced its establishment in the shortest possible time. The position of Director督辦 cannot be divided due to the exercise of power. I have no choice but to hold it concurrently. However, my military affairs are numerous, and time is quite limited. Therefore, I have specially invited Mr. Ding Wenjiang to serve as Director-General總辦 so that he can be responsible for the progress nearby. After the establishment of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office, please urge the local gentry to supervise it strictly to achieve perfection." After Sun Chuanfang took office, he issued a proclamation, saying:</p>
<p>"Proclamation: In order to announce matters, it is noted that this office is now established. Article 2 of the organizational outline of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office states: 'The Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office shall have one Director督辦, concurrently held by the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces,' etc. Based on this, I, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, have chosen to take office as Director督辦兼任督辦 at 10:00 AM on May 4th of the 15th year of the Republic of China. This is to inform you, the military and civilians, one and all. Be sure to take heed. This proclamation is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Ding Wenjiang, the Director-General of the Songhu Commercial Port督辦 Office, resigned on December 12th due to injuries sustained in a car accident. His time in office was seven months. The most significant event during these seven months was the recovery of the Mixed Court (會審公廨), because it was related to the concessions. The process is briefly described below.</p>
<p>When the May Fourth Movement occurred in the 8th year of the Republic of China, the citizens of Shanghai realized the practical effect of participating in political movements. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession happened to increase taxes. The citizens also jointly planned countermeasures to resist it. On the one hand, they demanded that the Municipal Council cancel the tax increase proposal, and on the other hand, they demanded that the Municipal Council establish Chinese directors華董, etc. In January of the following year, the Municipal Council agreed to establish five Chinese advisors華顧問. After the May 30th Massacre, the Chinese side put forward thirteen demands, including the establishment of Chinese directors華董 and the recovery of the Mixed Court公廨, etc. Although they did not achieve full victory, the problem of recovering the Mixed Court公廨 was finally resolved to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>The consular body's occupation and management rights of the Mixed Court公廨 occurred during the Xinhai Revolution. Since the winter of the second year of the Republic of China, our country has repeatedly negotiated, but with little result. After the May 30th Incident, the recovery of the Mixed Court公廨 was listed as one of the thirteen conditions, but was opposed by the diplomatic corps. Afterwards, the government separated the recovery of the Mixed Court公廨 from other conditions, and negotiated it separately. It was decided to hold discussions in Beijing in the spring of the 15th year of the Republic of China. However, due to the unstable political situation, the negotiations were ineffective. The Jiangsu Provincial Government took the opportunity to negotiate with the consular body as a local case. From the time Sun Chuanfang came to Shanghai to take office as the Songhu Commercial Port督辦, Ding Wenjiang began negotiations with the consular body. On August 31st, nine articles of the Provisional Regulations for the Recovery of the Shanghai Mixed Court公廨 were finally signed. These regulations are of great historical value and are often used for research by the academic community. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: (A) The Jiangsu Provincial Government shall change the original Mixed Court會審公廨 in the Shanghai Public Concession to a Provisional Court臨時法庭. Except for cases that fall under the consular jurisdiction of various countries according to treaty條的, all civil and criminal cases within the concession shall be tried by the Provisional Court臨時法庭. (B) All laws (including procedural laws) and regulations that are currently applicable to Chinese courts, as well as laws and regulations formulated and promulgated in the future, shall be applicable to the Provisional Court臨時法庭; provided that the provisions of these regulations and the judicial precedents of the Mixed Court會審公 accepted by future agreements shall be taken into account. (C) All criminal cases directly related to the治安 of the Concession, as well as cases that violate the Yangjingbang Regulations洋涇浜章程 and appendices, and cases in which Chinese people employed by people from countries with consular jurisdiction are criminal defendants, may be observed by a commissioner派委員 appointed by the senior consul. The commissioner shall sit with the judge. Any judgment of the judge shall take effect without the consent of the commissioner; but the commissioner shall have the right to record his dissenting points in detail. Furthermore, without the permission of the Chinese judge, the commissioner shall not question witnesses and defendants. (D) All summonses, arrest warrants, and orders of the court shall take effect upon being signed by the judge. The aforementioned summonses, arrest warrants, and orders shall be numbered and registered by the chief clerk before they are executed. Summonses, arrest warrants, and orders executed in the residences of people from countries with consular jurisdiction shall be signed by the consul of the country concerned or the competent official upon delivery without delay. (E) In civil cases in which people from countries with consular jurisdiction or the Municipal Council are plaintiffs, and in criminal cases in which people from countries with consular jurisdiction are complainants, the consul of the country concerned or the senior consul may send an official to court with the judge in accordance with treaty條的 provisions. (F) A court of appeal上訴庭 shall be established outside the Provisional Court臨時法庭, specializing in criminal appeals directly related to the public security of the concession and criminal appeals in cases involving Chinese and foreigners. The president of the court shall be concurrently held by the president of the Provisional Court臨時法庭. However, cases with a term of imprisonment of five years or less and cases that violate the Yangjingbang Regulations洋涇浜章程 and appendices shall not be appealed. In cases where the senior consul sends a commissioner to observe the initial trial, the senior consul may send another commissioner to observe the appeal, and his powers and appointment procedures shall be the same as those of the commissioner in the initial trial. In criminal appeals in cases involving Chinese and foreigners, the consuls shall send different officials to court in the same manner. (G) The president, judges, and appellate judges of the Provisional Court臨時法庭 shall be appointed by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Article 2: Cases in which the Provisional Court臨時法庭 sentences imprisonment of ten years or more and the death penalty shall be submitted by the court to the provincial government for approval. In cases that are not approved, the provincial government shall notify the court of the reasons for disapproval and re-examine and judge the case, and submit it to the provincial government for further review. Cases in which the death penalty is approved shall be sent to the foreign affairs office of the concession for execution. Inspection matters in the concession shall be carried out by the judge of the Provisional Court臨時法庭 together with the commissioner dispatched by the senior consul.</p>
<p>Article 3: All prisons attached to the Provisional Court臨時法庭, except for civil detention centers and women's prisons, which shall be stipulated separately, shall be managed by officials dispatched by the Municipal Council's Public Works Department. However, all management methods shall be implemented in accordance with the regulations for the management of prisons in China within the scope of feasibility and shall be subject to the supervision of the Provisional Court臨時法庭. The president of the court shall dispatch an inspection team to conduct investigations at any time. A commissioner dispatched by the senior consul shall be added to the team. If there are any deficiencies in the management of prisoners, the court shall be reported immediately, and the Municipal Council shall be ordered to improve the deficiencies immediately. The police department of the Municipal Council shall immediately comply and shall not delay.</p>
<p>Article 4: The summonses, arrest warrants, and orders of the Provisional Court臨時法院 shall be executed by judicial police. These bailiffs shall be selected and dispatched by the police department of the Municipal Council, but shall be directly responsible to the court when performing their duties as bailiffs. All requests or entrustments made by the Provisional Court臨時法庭 to the police department of the Municipal Council shall be actively assisted by the police department of the Municipal Council. Persons arrested by the Municipal Council's police station shall be sent to the Provisional Court臨時法庭 for interrogation within 24 hours, excluding holidays, and shall be released immediately if they are overdue.</p>
<p>Article 5: In civil cases involving Chinese and foreigners in which a consul sends an official to court with the judge, if there is dissatisfaction with the initial judgment, an appeal shall be filed with the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and the Special Commissioner shall review the case together with the consul concerned in accordance with treaty條的 provisions, but the original court may be ordered to re-examine the case with a different judge. The official sent by the consul shall also be replaced. If the Special Commissioner and the consul cannot agree on the appeal after the case has been re-examined, the re-examination judgment shall be final.</p>
<p>Article 6: The treasurer and the affairs stipulated by the joint committee of both parties shall be managed by the chief clerk. The chief clerk shall be recommended by the senior consul and appointed by the provincial government upon application by the Provisional Court臨時法庭. He shall be supervised and directed by the president of the Provisional Court臨時法庭, manage the staff, and properly supervise the court's expenses. If the chief clerk is incompetent or derelict in his duties, the president of the Provisional Court臨時法庭 may discipline him, and if necessary, he may be removed with the consent of the senior consul.</p>
<p>Article 7: The above six articles are the provisional regulations for the Jiangsu Provincial Government to recover the Mixed Court會審公廨. The implementation period is three years, calculated from the date of the return of the Mixed Court會審公廨. During this period, the central government may negotiate with the relevant ministers of various countries at any time for a final solution. If the above solution is agreed upon by both parties, these provisional regulations shall be abolished immediately. If there is still no final solution to the negotiations in Beijing after three years, these provisional regulations shall continue to be implemented for another three years, provided that the provincial government may notify and propose amendments six months before the expiration of the first three-year period.</p>
<p>Article 8: At any time in the future, when the Chinese central government negotiates with the governments of various countries to abolish consular jurisdiction, it shall not be bound by any provisions of these provisional regulations.</p>
<p>Article 9: The date of implementation of the measures for the return of the Mixed Court會審公廨 stipulated in these provisional regulations shall be separately determined by the representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the senior consul.</p>
<p>On January 1st of the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Mixed Court會審公廨 was officially returned, and the judicial power lost in the concession for more than ten years began to be recovered.</p>
<h3>From Luxury to Education</h3>
<p>— Wang Yunwu</p>
<p>(Reprinted from the Hong Kong edition of the newspaper's Sunday Commentary)</p>
<p>Although this article is directed at the Chinese high-level refugees聚居 residing in Hong Kong, the Chinese people in the isolated island of Shanghai and the high-level refugees from various places are also infected with the bad habit of luxury. Therefore, it is worthwhile to reprint it for the general readers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper here reported that Mr. Li Meng, a reporter from the French New Europe magazine, made the following statement during an interview with a reporter in Chongqing:</p>
<p>"Two weeks after the fall of Guangzhou, we arrived in Hong Kong. The general Chinese people spent a large amount of money in dance halls, restaurants, and high-end hotels. This abnormal situation can only be described as 'terrible'."</p>
<p>The comment of the word "terrible" here can be said to be very appropriate, and it can also be said to be truly in my heart. (Omission) Why are Chinese people so extravagant, and what methods can be used to get to the root of the problem? Please discuss it briefly.</p>
<p>I believe that the current trend of extravagance in our country is directly or indirectly related to education. On the one hand, the kind of education of being content with poverty and finding joy in the Way, as exemplified in ancient China by eating a basket of food and drinking a ladle of water in a humble alley, has actually long ceased to exist. However, the remaining influence can still control some fame-seeking scholars. But since the opening of the sea ports, a large number of ingenious goods have been imported. The nature of curiosity and beauty comes from talent. The temptation of material things is not easy to resist, and the Western materialism has been introduced into our country one after another, which is enough to promote the desire for material things among the Chinese people. When our country implemented new education, it inherited the Western utilitarianism, but failed to accept its spirit of sacrifice. As a result, we only know how to accumulate wealth but not how to distribute it. Therefore, the trend of luxury and love of goods not only surpasses the past, but also surpasses any other country. On the other hand, most of the school subjects are preparations for coping with the world and finding employment. There is no attention, or very little attention, to the proper entertainment of leisure time. In fact, the working hours of modern occupations are not very long, and those who have received higher education generally have higher positions and shorter working hours. In the 24 hours of a day, 8 hours are for sleep and 8 hours are for work. There are still 8 hours left. In addition to daily life and diet, most of the time is leisure time. If this time is used properly, it will directly benefit the body and mind and indirectly benefit the business. Conversely, it is not only harmful to the body and mind, but also harmful to the business. The reason is that improper entertainment of leisure time not only consumes energy and prevents people from serving earnestly, but also inevitably wastes money. The ancients said, "Insufficiency comes from excess"; and also said, "Only thrift can help integrity." The result of thriftlessness and insufficiency is that few do not damage integrity. Therefore, if the state wants to promote honest politics and the society wants to cultivate an honest atmosphere, it must first vigorously promote thrift. The achievement of the goal of thrift depends on the change of educational policy and the training of proper use of leisure time.</p>
<p>It may be too long to talk about the change of educational policy, so I will discuss it separately. Now I will focus on the aspect of proper use of leisure time. I believe that if you want to make good use of your leisure time, it is better to develop (1) the interest in reading, (2) the interest in sports, or (3) the interest in art during your study period.</p>
<p>The interest in reading has always been the focus of schools; but in reality, most Chinese students abandon books after leaving school. This phenomenon is not only recognized by the general public, but also evidenced by facts. Judging from the business of the publishing industry, the total number in the country for the whole year is only 25 million yuan, which is less than one-tenth of the business of one British and American company in Shanghai. Judging from the number of publications, Japan has a population of less than 90 million, and the total number of ordinary publications newly published in Showa 12 was 31,996. China has a population of no less than 500 million, and the number of new publications in the 25th year of the Republic of China was only 9,438, which is 30% of that of Japan. Also, according to research, the average number of copies printed for each publication in Japan is at least five times that of China. Therefore, in terms of the total number of copies actually printed and sold, the number of new publications in China in one year is only 6% of that of Japan. However, although China's population is more than five times that of Japan, the proportion of people who have received education in the population may only be one-fifth of that of Japan. With this increase and decrease, the number of books purchased by educated people in China is actually equal to 6% of that of Japan. From these two examples, we have to admit that our country's schools have failed greatly in cultivating the interest in reading. The reasons are very complicated; but the tendency of education to be passive and the failure to cultivate students' habit of self-study are the most important factors. The so-called passive tendency refers to the fact that the teaching method of infusion is adopted from elementary school to middle school; the students only study textbooks, the teachers teach it like this, and the students also learn it like this. Over time, they develop a passive habit of relying on the book, and cannot arouse the interest in reading automatically. Even college students should do a lot of automatic research, but one reason is that the habits of elementary and middle schools have gradually become natural, and the other is that the collections of libraries, with very few exceptions, are very short. Therefore, in practice, there is little difference from elementary and middle schools; what they study are only lecture notes, or a very small number of reference books, and the interest in reading is not easy to arouse. Once they leave school, the textbooks and lecture notes are useless, and they rarely read other books. The interest in reading should be cultivated from the beginning; because human nature is curious, reading can satisfy the curiosity. In theory, people who can read all like to read automatically. It is only because the education of elementary and middle schools has gradually become natural over time that it changes to passive. If the proportion of automatic research can be gradually increased in elementary and middle schools according to the students' abilities, especially the work of automatic collection of materials; and the equipment of the libraries of various schools can meet this requirement: then they will definitely be more interested in reading in school, and they will definitely be able to maintain this interest after leaving school.</p>
<p>The interest in sports also comes from birth; because the basis of sports is physical exercise. Try to see that all young children, except those who are sick, are lively and jumping, which is a clear proof that they love sports. Also try to see the crowd and lively situation in the school sports field, which is also a sign of love of sports. But the difference between sports and natural physical exercise is the existence or absence of rules, and the ability of physical exercise to maintain the common interest also depends on the existence of rules. At present, all schools have sports subjects, but only a few students always feel interested when they are in school, and few can maintain this interest after leaving school. The reason may be that there are too many classroom courses, and if you take care of this, you will inevitably lose the other; or because there are too few opportunities to participate, and if you are exposed to it once, you will inevitably be cold ten times. In addition, the purpose of school sports often focuses on trophies, and the facilities are not widespread; therefore, those who are good at sports have no time to read, and those who study seriously have no time to participate in sports; so that sports training that everyone should receive often becomes the profession of a few people, and the result is actually contrary to the original intention of sports. The reason for this is that it is closely related to the physical education methods of the facilities. The most popular sports in schools, such as football and track and field, require larger venues: and football, etc., have restrictions on the number of people, and the level of participants in track and field, etc., cannot be too neat; after this kind of elimination and obstacles, the excellent ones occupy the first place, and the ordinary ones fall behind: the few who occupy the first place become the talents of the trophy, and most of the laggards, in theory, have an urgent need for sports, but they cannot have the opportunity to participate. Therefore, if you want everyone to have an average interest in sports, in addition to the purpose of school sports facilities, the physical education methods adopted must also be adapted to the times. For example, when there is no large venue or no corresponding equipment, it is necessary to change to universal freehand exercises or simple equipment exercises so that everyone has the opportunity to participate. Then, since exercise is based on nature and can be practiced at any time, in other words, in addition to nature, it also increases habit, and its interest will naturally increase and be preserved for a long time.</p>
<p>Art, including sculpture, painting, music, etc., also comes from talent. Try to see that babies fall asleep when they hear singing, and smile when they see red and purple; and also try to see that barbarians can make crude sculptures, paintings and musical instruments, which can all be evidence of talent. Art can not only cultivate temperament, but also enable people's minds to transcend reality. Those who have a certain accomplishment in art will not feel the boredom of leisure; those with a particularly deep accomplishment can often imagine beyond reality and remain calm even when Mount Tai collapses in front of them. In addition to the inherent effect of art, the training of art requires patience, calmness and other characteristics. After these characteristics are formed through this training, they will affect the way of doing things or spending time in leisure. In the curriculum of elementary and middle schools in our country, art subjects are also regarded as compulsory subjects, but in practice, they are often nominal due to the lack of teachers or the emphasis on other courses. In addition, the general school entrance examinations do not pay attention to this; therefore, schools ignore it because its equipment is more difficult, students ignore it because it is not related to further education, and parents ignore it because it does not meet practical needs. The way to improve in the future is to first cultivate a large number of teachers so that there are people to teach; and then stipulate that the entrance examination should be held in the same way as other compulsory subjects; so that it can have the same effect as other compulsory subjects.</p>
<p>The above three kinds of interests can be cultivated during the school period, and only at that time can they be cultivated. It would be great to have all three. I only have one or two of these interests. In addition to being very helpful in doing things and studying, there will be no lack of appropriate ways to spend leisure time, and all kinds of bad habits caused by leisure time can be avoided. The degree of luxury of the Chinese people varies with the degree of education they receive; the higher the degree of education, the higher the degree of luxury: therefore, those who hold more radical views even call it enjoyment-style education; in fact, this is not the fault of a part of education, but the emphasis is on a part of education while ignoring other parts of education. Therefore, the higher the degree of education, the more people know about how to enjoy. Parents, because their positions are higher, have shorter daily working hours and longer leisure hours; and the education they received earlier did not include methods of using leisure time well; therefore, new-style and luxurious enjoyment and entertainment can take advantage of the gap to dominate them, resulting in the disadvantages mentioned in the first paragraph of this article.</p>

<h3>Telegram from Various Groups in Shanghai Supporting the Central Government's Resolution and Deeply Detesting Wang Jingwei's Collaboration with the Enemy and Seeking Peace, Thoroughly Eliminating Those Who Advocate Peace and Undermine Unity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various groups in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Central Government, saying, "President Chiang and all Central Executive Committee members of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Chongqing, be advised: Wang Jingwei's traitorous acts of colluding with the enemy to seek surrender and advocating peace are obvious. The people of the whole country deeply detest them. We, the people of Shanghai, absolutely support the Central Government's resolution and are deeply gratified for the future of the war of resistance. However, in order to eradicate compromise and consolidate unity, we hope that the Central Government can thoroughly eliminate all those who advocate peace and undermine unity, strengthen the mass movement, and reform the administrative structure to rectify discipline and warn others. Sincerely, all groups in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>After Successful Foreign Exchange Control, Improper Application Demand Decreases, Abundant Reserves Consolidate Currency Foundation, Control Aimed at Self-Defense and Stabilization of Currency System</h3>
<p>After the National Government implemented foreign exchange control, adopting a system of order approval and special permission for private remittances, the improper demand for foreign exchange has decreased significantly since its implementation. Simultaneously, on the supply side, the method of selling and settling foreign exchange has been adopted, with the proceeds being centrally managed by the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. This has enriched the source of foreign exchange and consolidated the currency foundation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After Implementation of Control, Applications Decrease</p>
<p>To safeguard the interests of legitimate merchants and further implement control, a system of order management was promulgated and implemented. For imported goods shipped after January 1, 1938, applications for foreign exchange would be rejected for all items except those approved by the government and holding a certificate. After the implementation of this measure, the application amounts of various banks gradually decreased compared to before. For example, from July 4th to 9th, applications amounted to £1,167,800, with £81,000 approved. From August 1st to 6th, applications amounted to £1,544,800, with £32,646 approved. From September 11th to 17th, applications amounted to £955,590, with £18,144 approved.</p>
<p>Special Approval for Private Remittance Applications</p>
<p>Special approval for private remittances is divided into two categories: (1) remittances for tuition fees for students studying abroad, and (2) remittances for household expenses. The procedures for student remittances follow the regulations of the Executive Yuan, but are subject to strict restrictions. Applicants must have a certificate from the Ministry of Education. For remittances for household expenses, an individual application form for foreign exchange needs must be filled out, stating the purpose and amount, etc. The Central Bank may limit the application amount and grant approval at its discretion during the review. Applications for private foreign exchange needs can only be submitted once a month, during the second week of each month.</p>
<p>Bank Procedures for Customers' Applications</p>
<p>When import merchants need foreign exchange, they should fill out an "Import Goods Foreign Exchange Needs Form." This form has a white background and black characters, divided into four copies: the original, a duplicate, one for the bank's record, and one for the customer's record. The form includes: (1) the name, address, and date of the bank; (2) the name and address of the import company; (3) the tariff number, nature of the goods, quantity, weight, value, country of production, country of export, and date of arrival; (4) the date of foreign exchange needed; (5) the port of import; (6) the country and place to which further transport is required; and (7) the purpose, etc., all of which must be filled out. Then, the customer fills out the attached guarantee, guaranteeing that all the above items are filled out correctly.</p>
<p>Improper Application Demand Decreases</p>
<p>Foreign exchange control has now been declared a success, foiling the "United Reserve Bank" of North China's plan to exchange legal tender for foreign exchange. After its implementation, China's foreign trade has improved, and the amount of import surplus has gradually decreased, allowing the domestic industry to gradually develop. The improper demand for foreign exchange has therefore sharply decreased. After adopting the method of selling and settling foreign exchange, the source of foreign exchange reserves has become abundant, and the currency foundation has become more consolidated. Therefore, China's implementation of control is entirely for self-defense and to stabilize the currency system, and is by no means a symbol of depleted reserves. It is hoped that the people of the country will have this understanding.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Exchange Increases Amount, Remittances up to 150 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of Shanghai-Hangzhou exchange in mid-September of last year, the limit was initially only 25 yuan, later increased to 50 yuan. It is now known that the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has received a report from the Hangzhou Post Office of the Zhejiang Postal Administration that the amount for remittances to Hangzhou has been increased to 150 yuan. However, the charging method remains the same, with a remittance fee of one cent per yuan and a supplement fee of one cent, totaling two cents per yuan.</p>
<h3>Fellow Townsmen from Ningbo Retain Yu Jimin, Reply Received</h3>
<p>Liu Jianxu agreed to convey the request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the resignation of Yu Jimin, the director of the Ningbo Police Bureau and commander of the city defense. The Ningbo Association in Shanghai has sent separate telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province, and Commander Liu of the 3rd Group Army, requesting his retention. It is now known that the association has received a reply telegram from Commander Liu: "Mr. Yu Qiaqing and fellow townsmen, I have received your telegram. All of you care about your hometown and believe that Director Yu Jimin has been in charge of police affairs for a long time and is familiar with the local situation. Your thoughts of retaining him from afar are sincere, and you wish to reverse his decision to resign. I will convey your request to fulfill your wishes. Liu Jianxu, 30th day, secret."</p>
<h3>Japanese Warlords Exhaust Military Strength, Heavy Losses for Navy and Air Force, 1,503 Aircraft, 19 Warships of Various Sizes</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, citing a certain foreigner inspecting North China, since the Japanese invasion of China in the autumn of 1937, in addition to heavy losses and casualties in the army, in the air force, the number of aircraft destroyed by the Chinese side by the end of 1938 totaled 1,503. In the navy, as a result of fierce battles on the Yangtze River, a total of 19 warships of various sizes were sunk and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Increasingly Active, Inland Water Transportation Cut Off Again, Two Small Japanese Vessels Intercepted at Qingyang Port</h3>
<p>According to the Modern News Agency, the Chinese guerrilla forces have been quite active recently in the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway area and have launched surprise attacks on the railway and important waterways during Japanese transportation, achieving remarkable results. The Japanese have repeatedly suffered heavy losses and are overwhelmed, considering it a great hardship. On New Year's Day, two small Japanese vessels, towing six civilian boats loaded with military supplies and provisions, were surrounded and intercepted by a large guerrilla force in the Qingyang Port area. The Japanese suffered many casualties, and all the ships and cargo were captured by the Chinese army. Only two Japanese merchants and the owner of the vessel escaped and returned to Shanghai. After receiving the report, the Japanese sent 200 soldiers to the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway area yesterday afternoon in an attempt to "encircle and suppress" the guerrillas. At the same time, due to the unrest in various inland waterways, the Japanese strictly ordered all civilian ships to temporarily suspend navigation to prevent attacks. As a result, inland water transportation has been completely cut off again. The business losses suffered by various shipping companies are significant.</p>
<p>Inland River Blockade</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, after the Shanghai Inland Water Shipping Company, a Japanese business, implemented control over inland navigation rights and dispatched ships, guerrilla units in various guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have actively started operations. The voyages have been repeatedly detained or attacked, making navigation very difficult. In order to prevent guerrilla activities, the Japanese have implemented a blockade of the inland waterways. Various shipping companies have also suspended operations due to the danger of navigation and the low volume of passengers and cargo. Inland voyages have been completely suspended, and there have been no voyages in recent days.</p>
<p>Passenger and Freight Interruption</p>
<p>According to sources in the inland navigation industry, the activities of inland guerrilla units have been thriving recently, and inland voyages have suffered a great blow. Therefore, ships returning to Shanghai from the inland areas are facing danger along the way, and some waterways have been blockaded, resulting in a large number of ships being stranded in the inland areas, especially in western Zhejiang. Most of them are cargo ships. As a result, passenger and freight transportation to and from the inland areas has completely stopped.</p>
<p>Civilian Navigation Suspended</p>
<p>Before inland navigation was completely suspended, the civilian ship voyages came into being in response to the situation of unrest in the inland areas where there were fewer voyages on major routes. However, recently, due to the blockade of inland waterways, they have also been forced to completely suspend navigation, making transportation to and from the inland areas increasingly difficult. According to the shipping companies, it is necessary to wait for the situation to stabilize somewhat before the waterways can be opened and voyages can be restored.</p>
<p>Suspension of Navigation in Shanghai Suburbs</p>
<p>The number of inland voyages from Shanghai to the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Beixinjing, Minhang, Yexie, Songjiang, Xindai, Chuanlai Temple, Qingpu, Kunshan, Jiaozhi, etc., has always been higher than in other places. Although voyages in various places have been affected by occasional suspensions, the suburbs have still been able to barely maintain them. However, in recent days, guerrilla units have been extremely active in various places in the suburbs, launching attacks from time to time, resulting in the interruption of voyages.</p>

<h3>Newsboys' School Holds New Year's Party, Meeting Held at the YMCA on Sichuan Road Yesterday, Totaling Over Seven Hundred Newsboys</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Protection Association and the Newsboys' School jointly organized by this newspaper have been established for half a year. Currently, there are ten schools offering classes, with over five hundred newsboys enrolled. The aim is to integrate education with production and provide vocational guidance to cultivate healthy news vendors and healthy citizens. With the support of the education community and society, the results have been quite satisfactory. On the occasion of the 28th New Year, the school held a New Year's party at the YMCA auditorium on Sichuan Road at 2 p.m. yesterday to promote the spirit of the school and enhance friendship. Attendees included Chen Heqin, Chairman of the Shanghai Children's Protection Association, Mrs. White of the Service Group of the Shanghai International Women's Association, well-known figures from all walks of life such as Cai Renbao, Zhao Zongyu, and over seven hundred newsboys. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement of the Meeting</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the meeting, two newsboys were seen standing on both sides of the gate, providing attentive service. Upon entering the auditorium, all five hundred newsboys were seated in order, wearing the blue cloth uniforms made by this newspaper, simple and neat, which was enough to show the vitality of young children at a time when China was in great difficulty. The symbol on the uniform, shaped like a bell, probably contained the meaning of beating the gong to awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind. The words "Love Yourself, Love Others" were written on it. Their full spirit and strict order were well received by people from all walks of life attending the meeting. The layout of the meeting place was simple and solemn. At 2 p.m. sharp, all the participants had arrived. Their adherence to time and elimination of old habits were also commendable. Then, the meeting was announced to begin, and the national anthem was sung. The emotions of the five hundred newsboys were extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Chen Heqin's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Heqin delivered a speech, saying that it was the first time for newsboys to gather and socialize during the New Year. The Newsboys' School was founded by the Children's Protection Association, and with the help of Shen Bao, it was able to move forward. There are now ten schools offering classes, and the help given by Shen Bao to the school is not only to ensure that funding is not interrupted, but also to provide spiritual and intellectual support. The Newsboys' School has been running for six months, and the progress has been good. There are more than 2,000 newsboys in Shanghai. While the students have already obtained the opportunity to receive education, there are still 1,500 newsboys who have not yet received education. We hope that all of them will be able to receive education. Today, we are holding this meeting to thank the YMCA for lending the meeting place and to thank the Shen Bao for its encouragement and sponsorship. He hoped that the children would show a new spirit at the beginning of the New Year and be comparable to the American newsboy Edison in the future.</p>
<p>Mrs. White's Speech</p>
<p>After the female students of the Municipal Council Girls' Middle School sang Christmas carols, Mrs. White of the Service Group of the Shanghai International Women's Association gave a speech. Mrs. White brought a generator to the meeting and, in a kind and approachable manner with fluent and tactful words, first invited six newsboys to the stage to test the generator. Then, she delivered a speech, saying that this generator is also the source of the material in today's newspapers. Since you know that I am an American, you should know that this telegraph machine was invented by the American Edison. Mr. Edison's early career was the same as the service you are doing today. He was first a newsboy, then sold newspapers on the train, and then obtained permission from the stationmaster to print newspapers on the train in his spare time to study telephone and telegraph machines. One day, Edison accidentally spilled sulfuric acid on the ground while studying electric machines, causing the superintendent to stop him from printing newspapers on the train. However, Edison did not lose heart because of this and continued his research at home. After several twists and turns, he finally succeeded. His contribution to the world is great. Mrs. White also said that there are many newsboys in the United States who go to school after delivering newspapers, which has become a common phenomenon. As a woman, I would also like to be a newsboy and study. Mrs. White put forward that newsboys should adhere to the following creeds: 1. Study hard; 2. Be honest; 3. Help others, and wished them to work hard for the country.</p>
<p>Cai Renbao's Speech</p>
<p>Cai Renbao said in his speech that Shen Bao has a popular weekly that can be read by people with limited knowledge, which is of great benefit. Newspapers are a public instrument of society and should aim to benefit society. The newspaper's arguments and records benefit society. The attitude of you newsboys in selling newspapers must focus on honesty. Zhao Zongyu said in his speech that Shen Bao's sponsorship of the Newsboys' School is by no means out of pity for you or for relief, but because you are young and promising, and you are very lovable. If you can study, you should work hard and be polite in your service, and cultivate both your virtues and careers. From being lovable today to being respectable in the future, this is the small meaning of Shen Bao's sponsorship of the Newsboys' School. He also used a diamond as a metaphor, hoping that the newsboys would have a persevering will and a spirit that does not avoid wind and frost. He also used a magnet as a metaphor, hoping that the 500 newsboys who are enrolled can set an example and arouse the sympathy of all sectors of society, and that they will cooperate and sponsor the more than 1,000 newsboys who have not yet enrolled, so that they can also have the opportunity to study. Then, he distributed the prepared candy to all the newsboys, and the principal of the Newsboys' School gave a training speech to encourage them.</p>
<p>Donations and Entertainment</p>
<p>Following this, students from the ten schools of the Newsboys' School held a disaster relief donation event, with each school donating more than ten yuan or five or six yuan, all of which were earned by the newsboys through hard work. Cai Renbao, representing the Relief Association, accepted the donations and expressed his thanks, saying that this was enough to show the newsboys' nature of loving themselves and loving others. Then, the entertainment began, with a total of more than 20 programs, including singing, Peking opera, and magic, which lasted until night. The reporter also talked briefly with the newsboys, who said that the current training goals of the school are divided into: 1. Family visits; 2. Love yourself, love others; 3. Central training; 4. Vocational guidance, and that extracurricular activities such as speech contests are also emphasized. They expressed their pleasant emotions of serving and studying at the same time.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Fundraising Committee Continues to Promote Fundraising, Broadcasting Ends, Thanks to All Parties, Flower Community Raises 15,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a broadcasting fundraising event to raise money to support refugees. The event has ended on schedule. The General Assembly thanked all parties and the fundraising teams of the association will continue to fundraise from now on to promote fundraising work. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Continue to Promote</p>
<p>In order to continue to promote the fundraising and support work, the association has sent the support certificates to the leaders of each fundraising team and asked them to start promoting fundraising from now on. The association also appealed to all sectors of society to continue to support, saying that the association's fundraising campaign to support refugees is currently continuing. It is hoped that all women who have not yet supported will continue to support, and those who have already supported will persuade their relatives and friends to support, and participate together to complete the good deeds. The support certificates can be obtained at the office, 414 Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, telephone 18533.</p>
<p>Thanks to All Parties</p>
<p>The association's broadcasting fundraising event has ended, and it specially thanks all parties. In order to promote the movement to support refugees, the association held a broadcasting fundraising event. It was honored by the joint broadcast by all the major radio stations in the city, the Hakka guest programs of each radio station, the donation of advertisements by major merchants, and the unanimous participation of the city's entertainment industry, film industry, famous singers, and famous actors in the special broadcasting programs. The gesture of joining hands to benefit the victims of the disaster is admired and inexplicable, and it is specially advertised in the newspaper to express gratitude and to promote benevolence. All the detailed numbers of the generous donations from benefactors from all walks of life will be reported daily by the Daya Radio Station from today onwards (reporting time is from 10:20 to 11:00 in the morning, and from 11:40 to 12:20 in the afternoon). It will be notified again after the statistics are completed. During the period of the General Assembly, due to the heavy workload, there may be some inadequacies in the reception and other aspects, and it is hoped that you will understand.</p>
<p>Wang Wanbai's Speech</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Wanbai, Chairman of the Broadcasting Industry Association, delivered a speech at the Sino-Western Radio Station last night at the invitation of the Broadcasting Fundraising Conference, saying that today is the last day of the broadcasting fundraising. Thanks to the advocacy of the Relief Association, the efforts of the broadcasters, and the enthusiasm of the benefactors, the results have been excellent. Although I am representing the radio station, all the radio stations are only providing material support. All the planning of the affairs and the troubles of income and expenditure are undertaken by the citizens' group of the association. I feel very tired. As for the donation report, the broadcasting is hasty, and there may be some mistakes. I talked with Mr. Lin Kanghou, and he said that the funds raised jointly by the radio stations will be reported in detail in the future. The work in the meeting is serious, and it is worthy of admiration. The benefactors are generous in their donations and enthusiastic in their relief efforts. Of course, they have nothing to ask for, but according to the experience of religion, those who help others will surely be helped by God, and the return of rewards will come naturally. The Christian Bible says that even giving a cup of cold water to a little boy, God will not forget it. As for the amount of donation, please do what you can, because people look at how much is donated, but God looks at how much is left. In short, donating money to help others is a right, not an obligation. The Bible says, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." Please do not miss this last opportunity for good fortune.</p>

<h3>US Films Uninspected Telegrams, Japan Protests</h3>
<p>The Japanese side alleges that the US Global Wireless Radio Company has been filming uninspected telegrams to the United States in the Public Concession for nearly six months. Japan has recently protested to the US President.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Flock to Shanghai, Many are Artists, Journalists, etc., Raising Funds to Publish Newspapers, Arrange Jobs</h3>
<p>According to a fast news agency report from this port, a large number of Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Conte Rosso ship arrived in Shanghai, originally said to carry only 240 people, but actually carried 290 people. Also, the Potsdam ship was originally said to carry only 60 people, but in fact increased to 128 people. The Shanghai German-Austrian Jewish Refugee Relief Committee said that due to the continuous arrival of Jewish refugees, the number has reached 1,400 by yesterday, and it is difficult to settle them. They are now discussing the establishment of a large-scale reception center in Hongkou. The first reception center will be set up in the Chinese Primary School of the Municipal Council on Huade Road, and it is planned to renovate the school building to accommodate 1,400 people, and then increase it to 2,000 people. To facilitate Jewish refugees, a German newspaper will be published from December 31. The newspaper is not an organ against the National Socialist Party or anti-Hitler, but purely serves Jewish refugees and helps them find jobs. It is reported that many of the Jewish refugees who have arrived in Shanghai are poets, writers, journalists, musicians, and workers.</p>
<h3>Chinese Philanthropic Children's Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Refugee Children</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Chinese Philanthropic Children's Association has been distributing winter clothing to refugee children since New Year's Day. Today is the third day. From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., the distribution of winter clothing will continue at the Huangjia Ku Garden, No. 33 Kade Road, at the Civilian Education Institute. Each set of winter clothing has an inscription that reads, "People help me, and I must help others." As for infant refugees, they can be brought by their families with vouchers to receive clothing. This year, street refugees will be given clothing for a total of four days. Tomorrow is the fourth day, and the distribution will continue at the Philanthropic Education Institute at No. 1231 Lafayette Road, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is reported that this year, with donations of more than 12,000 yuan, more than 10,000 sets of winter clothing for refugee children have been made. Among them, 6,000 sets are prepared for street refugee children, and more than 4,000 sets are prepared for refugee children in shelters. Each set of winter clothing includes one padded jacket and one pair of padded pants, which originally cost more than two yuan. However, due to the enthusiastic donation of more than 100 dan of high-quality cotton by many cotton merchants, such as Zhiyi Hao and Tongcheng Hao, the actual cost per set is only 1.2 yuan. This shows the society's love and consideration for the refugee children.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Three-Month Extension for the Recall of Old Notes from the Former Yunnan Provincial Bank Expired at the End of February The Fuxin Bank Has Been Ordered to Comply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, regarding the old American-printed banknotes issued by the former Yunnan Provincial Fumin Bank, had properly established a recall and destruction plan, limiting the recall to be completed from September 1 to the end of November last year. An order was issued to comply with the plan to facilitate the closure. The deadline has now passed, and the recall should have ended. However, due to inconvenient transportation in the province and remote provinces, not all banknotes have been recalled. Repeated requests have been made for an extension. Considering the actual situation and to ease the people's hardships, a three-month extension has been specially approved, from December 1 last year to the end of February of the 28th year [1939]. During this extension period, old Fumin Bank banknotes circulating in various counties and cities of the province should be exchanged at exchange institutions or registered for exchange at local chambers of commerce. Once the period expires, the Fuxin Bank will be ordered to handle the closure and no further extension will be granted. The bank has reportedly been ordered to comply, and the provincial government has issued a notice to all sectors of society to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Charitable Lottery Distribution Committee Distributes Fourth Installment of Prize Money</h3>
<p>Still being organized... The fourth installment of the French Concession Refugee Relief Charitable Lottery will be announced soon. After the fourth installment of the lottery was drawn on December 8th of last year, the winning prize money has been claimed one after another. It is now known that the lottery relief fund distribution committee recently held a meeting to distribute the fourth installment of prize money. Those who attended included Father Rault, Feng Zhenduo, Chasber, Li Guiyong, Patenotre, Pullen, Yan Huiqing, An Xianjin, Jones, McNorton, and Pathetot. The meeting was chaired by Father Rault to discuss the method of distributing the fourth installment of refugee relief prize money. It is reported that the amount of distribution has not yet been organized on the same day, and will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Failure of the Pseudo "City Bank" Organization Japanese Side Refuses to Invest Activities Have Ceased</h3>
<p>Modern News reports that after the pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan took office, in an attempt to control finance, Zhou Wenrui, Zhu Manqing, and others prepared to organize a pseudo "Shanghai City Bank" and proceeded very actively. They set up an office in a villa on Jessfield Road, appointing Gu Disan as "President" and Fu Pinggui and others as "Managers." The capital was set at 10 million yuan, and operations would begin after half of the amount was collected. It is now known that this plan, after several months of preparation, has been declared a failure. Initially, the Japanese side had promised to invest 2.5 million yuan, but suddenly went back on their word and have not provided a penny of assistance, which greatly affected the progress of the "City Bank." The "Pseudo Government" is very short of funds and has no surplus funds to allocate. Therefore, the "Pseudo Mayor" had another whimsical idea. Because the former "Dadao Municipal Government Supervision Office" had transferred 1 million yuan in tax revenue and deposited it in the Japanese Zhengjin Bank, which had not been used, he requested the Japanese side to allow the withdrawal of this deposit to be used for the organization of the pseudo "City Bank." Unexpectedly, he was again sternly rejected by the Japanese side, who did not allow any amount to be moved. Therefore, the attempt to establish the pseudo "City Bank" has been declared a complete failure and cannot be prepared. Therefore, the office has recently fallen into a state of stagnation.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Public Comfort Mission About to Depart to Comfort the Soldiers on the Front Lines in South China</h3>
<p>Various public organizations in Shanghai have voluntarily organized comfort missions to comfort the soldiers fighting on the front lines. The first group of people to depart is about to go to the Northwest. It is now known that the second comfort mission, a group of more than ten people, is ready and will take a boat to Hong Kong in the coming days, and then go to the front lines of our army in South China, representing the people of Shanghai to comfort the soldiers fighting the war. The trip is scheduled for two months. The frost on the roof tiles is very thick.</p>
<h3>The Weather in This City is Cold Again The Frost on the Roof Tiles is Very Thick</h3>
<p>The weather in this city turned cold again yesterday. In the morning, the frost on the roof tiles was very thick, like a pile of thin snow. The sky was also overcast, and the north wind was blowing tightly. The temperature dropped quite drastically compared to yesterday.</p>

<h3>Armed Japanese Patrol on Nanjing Road Early on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Early on New Year's Day, the Lao Zha Police Station received a report that three Japanese soldiers were patrolling Nanjing Road, each carrying a pistol. A foreigner reported to the police station that at 3:30 in the morning, he had witnessed three Japanese patrol soldiers walking at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road. The police station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate, but they had already disappeared. However, no unfortunate incident occurred.</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Four Suburbs of Shanghai is Depressed Traffic on the Huangpu River Resumes The Area South of the Huangpu Remains Blockaded</h3>
<p>During the Gregorian New Year, the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai became tense. Security in various districts was tightened, and most of the water and land transportation was suspended. Traffic on the Huangpu River resumed yesterday, while ferries west of the Huangpu River were suspended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suburbs</p>
<p>In the past few days, the guerrilla forces scattered in the suburbs of Shanghai have become active again, especially in the areas south and west of the Huangpu River. They launch surprise attacks from time to time, so various districts have tightened security and advanced the curfew time. Residents are uneasy and rarely go out. After 5 p.m., there are no pedestrians, and the situation is quite depressed.</p>
<p>Huangpu River</p>
<p>Traffic on the Huangpu River was completely suspended on the Gregorian New Year's Day due to the closure of all ferry crossings. Yesterday, it was reopened. The Donggou, Gaoqiao, and Gaomiao ferry crossings resumed normal operations. The ferry from the South Pier of the Huangpu River to Zhoujiadu also resumed at the same time. Because of the one-day blockade, there were many passengers.</p>
<p>South of the Huangpu</p>
<p>The situation south of the Huangpu River is quite tense because the guerrilla forces scattered there are very active. All ferry crossings such as Desheng Port, Yangsi Bridge, Wangjia Ferry, Dujia Xing, Zhagang, Guangang, Tangkou, and Lutan Temple are completely blockaded. Passengers traveling to and from the Huangpu River have to detour through Pudong, but the inspection along the way is very strict.</p>
<p>West of the Huangpu</p>
<p>Currently, the only land route between the concession and the west of Shanghai is Hongqiao Daxi Road. The only waterway is the direct ferry to Beixinjing. Recently, due to the unstable situation in the area, the ferry between Beixinjing and the concession has been suspended. Security has also been tightened at key land points, and inspections are very strict. Therefore, there are very few pedestrians. All key transportation points between the west of Shanghai and the south of the city are also blockaded, prohibiting pedestrian traffic.</p>
<h3>The War in Haimen, Qidong, and Nantong Has Stopped Foreign Ships to Sail Today</h3>
<p>In order to seize the tax revenue along the Yangtze River estuary, the Japanese side mobilized troops and used naval, land, and air forces to oppress the Chinese army in Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu at the end of last year. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle. After the Chinese army fought bravely, they retreated to Nantong and the San Chang to hold their ground. Various foreign ships have resumed sailing, but cargo transportation has been sharply reduced. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>Five or six thousand Japanese and puppet troops began to invade Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu on December 22 last year. At that time, the Chinese army was under heavy pressure from the Japanese side's five-pronged attack. In order to preserve their strength, they retreated to the interior. Some units of the Chinese army suffered heavy casualties. Later, after the brave counterattack by the elite troops of the 9th and 10th Regiments of the 5th Brigade of the 4th Guerrilla Zone of the 24th Army Group, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Therefore, they retreated back to Nantong City and the Qinglong Port Dasheng San Chang and other places to hold their ground. This time, the Japanese army spent a lot of troops and ammunition, but gained nothing. They showed their desperation and only made themselves worse.</p>
<p>The War is Pacified</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops in Haimen have been deeply confined since retreating to the San Chang. They have built fortifications around them to prevent attacks by the Chinese army and dare not go out to cause trouble. The war in northern Jiangsu can be temporarily considered pacified. The ports along the Yangtze River, such as Songji Port, Niugang, Shuji Port, Lao Hong Port, Xin Port, Lingdian Port, and the Sanhe Port Dongyi Hao in Qidong, are still garrisoned by the Chinese army. However, the curfew is stricter at night. They hide in the countryside during the day, and local order is stable. Foreign ships are scheduled to sail as usual on January 3. However, passenger and cargo traffic will probably not recover in the short term.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Team Intercepts Japanese Soldiers in Huacao Kills Two Japanese Soldiers Seizes Three Rifles</h3>
<p>The guerrilla teams in the Hongqiao Airport area in western Shanghai have been exceptionally active recently. The day before yesterday morning, Yao, the captain of the brigade, led more than 30 guerrillas to inspect Zhuzhai Town. On the way through Huacao Town, they suddenly encountered Japanese soldiers stationed in the town. The guerrillas intercepted them. The gunfire erupted, and bullets rained down. The villagers were panicked and fled in all directions. After about two hours, the Japanese soldiers were unable to resist and collapsed. Two Japanese soldiers were killed, and two Type 38 rifles were captured. It is reported that several guerrillas were also injured.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Team in Pudong Strengthens Political Work</h3>
<p>After the large-scale invasion by the Japanese army in the Fengnanchuan One Two County Guerrilla Zone in Pudong last month, a fierce battle broke out. Because the Chinese army used the terrain to lure the enemy deep, the county seat of Fengnan was once occupied by the Japanese army. Later, because the Chinese side harassed them day and night with guerrilla tactics, the Japanese army did not dare to linger and hurriedly retreated to their original defense line, that is, the Chuansha area retreated to Chuansha County, the Nanhui area retreated to Zhoupu, and the Fengxian area was completely abandoned. The situation in the three counties has been restored to the situation before the 12th and 13th. However, after this battle, the Japanese army's capabilities have become clear, and the method of resistance should also be changed accordingly. Grasping the enemy's weaknesses (that is, the tactic of breaking them one by one, concentrating a small number of troops to attack a certain guerrilla base), and engaging in self-improvement, there have been significant changes in terms of equipment, organization, ideology, and action. It is necessary to launch operations simultaneously from several aspects in the future to disperse the Japanese army's strength, and to implement emergency blockade methods in the waterways to prevent Japanese speedboats from operating. In terms of local administration, the principle of not disturbing the people will also be strictly implemented. The county government will directly manage the army's salaries and provide them directly. On the one hand, the work of eradicating traitors will be intensified to make the Japanese army lose their eyes and ears and fall into a state of blind action. Therefore, a new situation will unfold in the future of Greater Pudong.</p>
<h3>Puppets Collude with the Japanese Form Parties and Pursue Private Interests The So-called Advisory Group is Also Divided into Two Factions</h3>
<p>Nishimura, the chief of the Japanese guidance group in the pseudo "Municipal Government," and instructors Kai Kojima and others were dismissed and investigated by the Japanese side for a large-scale smuggling case. Another instructor, Yakudai, was also arrested on suspicion of stealing warehouse goods. Therefore, the Nishimura guidance team was affected by the scandalous incident and disintegrated. The pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan, in order to facilitate his own arbitrary private interests, took the opportunity to try to get rid of the constraints and pleaded with the pseudo "President of the Executive Yuan" Liang Hongzhi to consult with the Japanese side to cancel the instructor system. However, the Japanese side refused. However, as a result of consultations, the name of the instructor was changed to advisor, and two Japanese people, Ishii and Nishida, were appointed to reorganize the "guidance team" into an "advisory group." Ishii is a close figure to Fu Xiaoan and serves as the chief advisor to the pseudo "Municipal Government." Nishida is close to Su Xiewen and serves as an advisor to the pseudo "Municipal Government." Therefore, the advisory group is divided into the Fu and Su factions. The advisors of other pseudo "bureaus" will also be generated from these two factions. Therefore, the pseudo "government" will be handled by two factions in opposition to each other, monitoring each other. The nature is different from the era of the previous guidance team. The lack of unity in the Japanese and puppet affairs is evident. However, under the circumstances of different backgrounds, it will be more difficult for Fu and Su to cooperate in handling pseudo "politics." Therefore, the number of conflicts will inevitably be greater than before.</p>
<h3>National Government Orders Factories Near War Zones to Register and Move Inland Those Unable to Move Can Have Transportation Costs Provided National Government Subsidizes Production Through Economic Ministry</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the war of resistance, in addition to encouraging various domestic goods factories to produce domestic goods as much as possible, the National Government has also ordered local governments in various provinces to assist factories in moving inland in order to support them and facilitate their development. It is now known that since the outbreak of the war of resistance the year before last, hundreds of factories in the southeastern provinces have either moved to the Shanghai Concession to start work or moved to the interior after the National Army withdrew westward due to the war. There were also not a few who could not move due to environmental constraints at the time. In view of this, the government recently reordered the factories in various places near the war zone to be actively registered by the provincial governments and to find ways to move inland. If the factory itself is unable to move, the local government will raise transportation costs or estimate and buy the factory, and then transport the machinery to the interior. The government authorities also made a decision to subsidize inland factories that are smaller in scale with funds from the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the construction departments of various provinces to revitalize industry and increase production. The measures have been finalized and a notice has been sent to various provinces to comply.</p>
<h3>Low Water Level in Inner Harbor in Winter Reduced Rice Shipments to Shanghai Only 5,000 Bags Shipped to Shanghai Per Day Sufficient Rice Reserves in Shanghai, No Worry for Civilian Consumption</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the water level in the inner harbor has been low, and navigation has been difficult. Therefore, rice shipments to Shanghai from the interior have been reduced to only about 5,000 bags per day. Shanghai's rice reserves have reached more than 600,000 bags, which is sufficient to maintain civilian consumption for three to four months. The price of rice is stable, and people's minds are at ease. The silver and money industry has properly arranged for the rice storage problem and is storing as much as possible. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reduced Source</p>
<p>Usually during the winter season, the tides have receded, and the water level of rivers is low. However, in recent years, due to the war, the tributaries and rivers in the interior have not been dredged, so the mud beds have increased, making it difficult for heavy sailing ships to navigate. The water level of the Yangtze River has also decreased, making it difficult for larger tonnage ships to approach ports. Due to these various reasons, rice shipments to Shanghai have been very scarce recently. Currently, only about 5,000 bags of rice are shipped to Shanghai every night from various ports and inland rivers, which is more than half less than one or two days ago.</p>
<p>No Worries about Civilian Consumption</p>
<p>Reporters from Modern News investigated the total amount of rice stored in the city and estimated that it reached 634,000 bags. This batch of rice is estimated to be able to maintain civilian consumption for three to four months. The price of rice in Shanghai has been stable since the end of the Gregorian calendar year. The highest quality white japonica rice sells for 12.23 yuan per stone, while the middle and second grades are between 10.45 and 11.12 yuan. As for rice exports, in addition to the more than 100,000 bags smuggled by the Japanese side (this item of rice is purchased from the interior and transported there), the number of Shanghai rice transshipped is still limited.</p>
<p>Rent a House to Store Rice</p>
<p>Regarding the previous shortage of warehouses for rice storage in Shanghai, rice merchants actively negotiated with the concession authorities and related organizations. It is now known that the silver and money industry will store as much domestic rice as possible in its original warehouses, and the warehousing fees are also particularly favorable. At the same time, rice merchants are also finding their own ways to rent vacant houses for storage. Therefore, the problem of storing the river rice from the interior has been resolved. If it is still not enough, the concession authorities will assist in properly arranging remedies.</p>
<h3>Polish Meat Exports Sales Widest in the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Polish news: Poland's main exports are coal, timber, sugar, salt, iron, agricultural products, textiles, and meat. In terms of meat, a large amount is exported every year, all of which are shipped to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. In the first three quarters of 1938, Poland exported a total of 136,000,000 zlotys worth of live pigs and meat. The amount for the same period in 1937 was 124.3 million zlotys. The largest increase was in veal and dried beef. The export volume of live pigs and pork did not increase or decrease. In terms of the export of live pigs and pork, 308,721 pigs were exported in the first three quarters of 1938, of which 123,217 were shipped to the United Kingdom, 102,870 to Germany, and 71,749 to the United States. In 1937, exports of live pigs and pork accounted for 24.4 percent of the total meat exports. In 1938, it accounted for 33.3 percent of total meat exports.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Affairs Establish a General Office for Import and Export of Products in Zhejiang Branches Established in Various Ports in Eastern Zhejiang Fully Established in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Since the coastal ports of South China were blockaded due to the war, most of the domestic products are now exported through Wenzhou and Taizhou in eastern Zhejiang. As a result, the import and export trade in eastern Zhejiang has suddenly become prosperous after the war. The sharp increase in tax revenue at the Ouhai Customs and the Yonghai Customs is also unprecedented. At the same time, the import of smuggled goods is also being discovered every day. It is now known that in order to prevent the smuggling of smuggled goods, in addition to stepping up anti-smuggling work, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have now sent personnel to join the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Product Adjustment Office to organize a national product import and export general office in eastern Zhejiang to handle the overall control, investigation, audit, inspection, inspection, and release work, in order to avoid the import and export of smuggled goods and enrich tax revenue. It is reported that the general office will establish branches in various coastal ports in eastern Zhejiang to effectively implement the work. It is expected to be fully established in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Post Office Sufficient Stamp Storage The Situation of the Peiping Printing Bureau is Unknown Already Printed Stamps are Sufficient for Several Years</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration received four types of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's third edition stamps bearing the late leader's portrait from the Directorate General of Posts at the end of October last year, the fractional Dr. Sun Yat-sen's stamps of the same edition that are convenient for ordinary use have not continued to arrive. It is thought that they are still being engraved and printed in Hong Kong. Most of the various current stamps sold by the Shanghai Post Office have always been printed by the Peiping Printing Bureau. Since the Huaibei [North China] bandits have been leaping around and the situation is very different, the situation of the Printing Bureau is quite unclear. Therefore, there are doubts about the issue of printing stamps. According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration, before the Lugouqiao [Marco Polo Bridge] Incident the year before last, the Directorate General of Posts knew that the situation in the north was unstable. Therefore, it transported as many stamps printed by the Peiping Printing Bureau to the interior as possible. Shanghai also received a lot, so there is no fear of panic in the next few years.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Direct Flight Resumption Awaits Approval From Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of resuming direct flights on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, after the Ningbo Garrison Command was ordered to prohibit it, all passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo had to detour through Wenzhou and Taizhou, which was inconvenient for all parties. A joint report was submitted to the Military Affairs Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of the × Army Group, requesting leniency and reopening. The case was passed by the Jinhua Navigation Affairs Conference on the 27th of last month, and the opinion was signed and submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. The reporter from Modern News inquired with a giant in the shipping industry yesterday, who replied that the case has not yet been formally approved by the Military Affairs Commission. However, a private telegram from Chongqing said that there is hope for resuming direct flights. Once approved, it can be realized. The report in yesterday's newspaper that the authorities had rejected the request due to defense reasons was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Two Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The British Kaibo, chartered by the Ningshao Shipping Company, has been approved to sail to Ningbo to load cargo and has sailed many times. The company received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday stating that the ship had left Ningbo yesterday after loading cargo and sailed directly to Shanghai. It will arrive in port this morning. The Meifu, of Jardine Matheson, will also depart from Ningbo and sail directly to Shanghai today or tomorrow, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow. After the two ships unload their cargo in Shanghai, they will continue to sail to Xiaowan and Ningbo. At present, most of the bulk cargo between Shanghai and Ningbo relies on these two ships for transportation, so freight is extremely crowded.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transport of Passengers and Cargo</p>
<p>After the Tangsai, which runs on the Ningbo-Taiwan line, and the Tangbei, which runs on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, both of Huamei Company, implemented the joint transportation of goods, all goods loaded in Shanghai and shipped to Ningbo can be transferred to Tangsai to be shipped to Ningbo upon arrival in Taiwan with a single ticket after paying all the freight at once. In addition, the Meida, which runs the Ningbo line of the Meili Company, was originally scheduled to be jointly transported with the Meifa of the company, but because Meifa was approved to sail to Wenzhou, it was changed to be jointly transported with Haifu Hana Mountain Thai and other ships. Before the restoration of direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, the general passengers recognized that this method was quite convenient.</p>
<h3>Loading and Unloading Goods in Front of Shops Do Not Impose Fines Lightly to Alleviate Merchants' Difficulties While Not Obstructing Traffic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Chengdu Road Police Station yesterday, saying: We are writing to you that, according to a letter from Yushang Yiji Candle Shop, a member of the 12th District Branch of our association, stating that our shop is located at No. 6 Tongfu Road. This morning (December 27), a special police officer came to inquire, saying that our shop had piled sandalwood on the cement pavement for an hour yesterday, and did not listen to the Chinese police's warnings, which violated police regulations and awaited punishment. After investigation, our shop did indeed add sandalwood yesterday, and it was unloaded from the car, moved to the shop through the cement pavement, and piled up. The distance was very close, and the time taken should not be too long. It was indeed the police deliberately demanding and seriously reporting the matter. Now that shops are stocking up, there is a daily inventory. If you are punished in this way, it will happen every day. I would like to ask your association to protect the merchants and think about the situation of the merchants, and quickly send a letter to the police station, asking them to consider the difficulties of the merchants and allow leniency in the future if various shops have goods to be loaded and unloaded within the scope of not hindering traffic, in order to maintain commerce. The association asks that the police station show some leniency and waive the fines if the traffic is not hindered, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Asks to Restrict All Ships Coordinate and Adjust Shipping on Eastern Zhejiang Line</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai believes that it has been very inconvenient for people traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo recently, and the cost of ships is exorbitant, which is beyond the means of ordinary people. The association recently sent a telegram to the Zhejiang authorities, asking for restrictions to be added. At the same time, the ships sailing on the eastern Zhejiang route are mostly very small and difficult to withstand wind and waves. Therefore, they should also be screened and adjusted to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3>German Shipping Restores Zhangjiagang Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Taiziwei Port route was affected by the bombing of the port by Japanese warships, and the flights were suspended, causing difficulties for the transport of passengers and goods between Shanghai and the interior. In order to clear passengers and goods in the interior, the foreign shipping industry is planning to restore the Jiangyin Zhangjiagang route. The German Luan and other ships have scheduled to resume service on the 3rd. Mota and other shipping companies will also send ships to join the service, which will solve the problem of passenger and freight transportation between Shanghai and the interior.</p>

<h3>Manager and Business Director Cross-Accusation Case: Initial Trial Found Not Guilty, Both Appealed; Higher Third Branch Court Sets Hearing Date Based on Submissions</h3>
<p>The agent of Zhen Feng Qin Ji Sugar Firm on Lao Yong'an Street in the French Concession filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Mei Shaoxiong, a Cantonese man who was the firm's business director for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, of breach of trust. He claimed that Mei Shaoxiong secretly obstructed Hakka merchants from paying debts totaling 700,000 to 800,000 gold dollars, affecting the firm's business. The complaint requested an investigation. Mei Shaoxiong hired lawyer Ge Zhiqin to defend him and filed a counter-suit for false accusation. The initial trial found both parties not guilty. Dissatisfied with the verdict, both parties appealed to the Criminal Division of the Higher Third Branch Court. He Jingtian of Zheng Feng Sugar Firm cited three points in his appeal, stating that the original trial did not thoroughly investigate and audit the accounts. He requested the Higher Third Branch Court to conduct a detailed examination, overturn the original verdict, and punish the appellee Mei Shaoxiong according to Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Based on the submission, the Higher Third Branch Court held two hearings, but no conclusion was reached. Recently, another hearing was scheduled. However, the appellee Mei Shaoxiong requested a postponement, and only the appellant He Jingtian, accompanied by his lawyer Mao Hanshen, appeared in court. The court announced that the hearing would be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Forging Gold Rubles: Principal Culprit Arrested; Deceived Pawnshops in Both Concessions</h3>
<p>Levitoff (transliteration), a 34-year-old Lithuanian residing on Huanlong Road in the French Concession, from October of last year, forged Russian rubles using lead and wrapping them in gold foil. He pawned them at various pawnshops in the British and French concessions, receiving over 30 French francs per coin. Sixteen pawnshops, including those at 115 Rue Notre Dame, 7 Route P. Henry, and 13 Route Bayle in the French Concession, were deceived. The French police discovered the fraud and dispatched detectives to arrest Levitoff, who was apprehended on December 24th of last year. According to his confession, he attempted to pawn the forged rubles at thirty pawnshops within the French Concession and several dozen pawnshops in the International Settlement. After investigation confirmed the facts, the French police transferred the defendant to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, requesting detention pending further investigation and prosecution. After a brief interrogation by Judge Shang, the hearing was adjourned for a week for further investigation, and the defendant was detained.</p>

<h3>Pan Yougao and Others: Convicted of Forgery</h3>

Li Zhishan, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court on the charge of forgery. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, Tang Mingshi, and Le Junwei to defend them. After interrogation, Judge Feng Shide of the First Criminal Division pronounced the verdict yesterday: Pan Yougao was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, commutable to a fine of two yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence.

<h3>Zhen Feng Factory Owner Tang Bushan and Others: Accused of Embezzlement and Breach of Trust</h3>
<p>Pan Housheng, a Ningbo native and owner of the Huacheng Yarn Factory at 22 Yuanmao Lane, west of Tiantong Road on North Zhejiang Road, recently hired lawyer Chen Wencan to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Tang Bushan, Tang Bulin, and Tang Bugao, the owners of the Zhen Feng Factory at 81, Lane 714, Xiaoshadu Road, Singapore Road, and Hao Jinsheng, an accessory civil defendant, of embezzlement and breach of trust. The indictment stated that in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the plaintiff, with Hao Jinsheng as guarantor, provided yarn to the Zhen Feng Factory, owned by the defendants Tang Bushan, Tang Bulin, and Tang Bugao, for processing and weaving cloth, with written evidence and a guarantee bond. However, the defendants Tang Bushan and others often delayed delivering the cloth made from the yarn provided by the plaintiff. Suspecting something amiss, the plaintiff investigated and discovered that the defendants had secretly sold the yarn provided by the plaintiff to Shen Sheng in Pudong for a sum of 1,000 taels. Furthermore, six pieces of pile wool and one piece of flannel that had been woven were pawned at the Zhenlong Pawnshop on Changping Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and the plaintiff redeemed them last month by paying the pawn price. The defendants Tang Bushan, Tang Bulin, and Tang Bugao were contractors for the plaintiff for processing and weaving cloth, but they violated their duties and, with the intention of appropriating the property, damaged the plaintiff's property by selling the un-woven raw materials for profit and pawning the woven products for personal use. According to Article 336, Paragraph 2, and Article 342 of the Criminal Law, their actions constitute the crime of embezzlement and breach of trust. As an accessory civil claim, the defendant Hao Jinsheng should be responsible for compensation as he had provided a guarantee. As the defendants Tang Bushan and others were heavily indebted and intended to flee, the plaintiff requested the court to issue a warrant for their arrest and punish them for embezzlement and breach of trust, and order them to compensate the plaintiff 716.375 yuan in national currency. If execution is ineffective, the accessory civil defendant Hao Jinsheng should be responsible for payment. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Xiao of the Second Criminal Division. The defendants failed to appear. The plaintiff, accompanied by his lawyer Chen Wencan, appeared in court and presented the case. The court ordered the case to be adjourned and reheard when the defendants are summoned to appear.</p>
<h3>Wife Commits Adultery, Sentenced; Countersues Husband for Embezzlement; Husband Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>Zheng Yanling, a Ningbo native and owner of the Weishun Knitting Factory at 1, Shunchang Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, 29 years old, previously reported that his wife, Zhao Lianying, first committed adultery with Fan Bingxing, his sister's husband, in their hometown. After writing a letter of repentance, she then went out with a factory employee named Cui to the Far East Hotel and committed adultery. Evidence in the form of Cui's letters was found. In early October of last year, Zheng reported this to the French police, who arrested Zhao and handed her over to the Special Second Court for legal action. As a result, she was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. Zhao, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, but the appeal was rejected. The sentence could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. She was granted bail pending further notice. Recently, Zhao hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing her husband Zheng Yanling of embezzling 1,600 yuan in savings and requesting legal action. Based on the complaint, the court held a hearing the day before yesterday, summoning the plaintiff and her lawyer, who presented the case. The defendant did not appear. The court adjourned the hearing for a later date. It is reported that Zheng Yanling has filed a lawsuit for divorce with the Civil Division of the court.</p>
<h3>Bandits Collude with Fake "Police": Robbing Passengers at Wharf Ferry</h3>
<p>Since the closing time of the public ferry at Dongchang Road in Pudong was extended from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM, those who worked in the concessions and returned later in the evening usually took rowing boats from Roosevelt Wharf to cross the river to Pudong. Recently, bandits have been colluding with fake "police." They board rowing boats from Pudong, wait in the middle of the river, and rob passengers of their belongings, clothes, money, hats, or purchased goods in the dark. These bandits are apparently in collusion with dozens of rowers, acting lawlessly. Since the beginning of winter, many passengers have been victimized, stripped down to their underwear and forced to return home in the cold, resulting in illness. However, the Japanese and puppet authorities have not taken any action to apprehend these bandits who harm the people.</p>
<h3>Xinza Road: Part of It Has Been Repaired</h3>
<p>The section of Xinza Road (New Bund Road) in the International Settlement from Chengdu Road to Mogan Road was damaged due to long-term neglect. The Public Works Department dispatched a large number of laborers to repair it. It is now reported that a portion of it has been repaired, so various rickshaws can pass westward from Datong Road. However, all kinds of rickshaws and vehicles are still prohibited from going eastward at the intersection of Mogan Road and westward at the intersection of Chengdu Road. They must detour along Shanhai Road or Xisuzhou Road along the river. Therefore, these two roads have been exceptionally busy recently.</p>
<h3>Guocui Bookstore to Expand</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Guocui Bookstore is a major Shanghai secondhand bookstore, opened by Weng Peide, the owner of the old bookstore, for over 20 years. It was quite large. Last year, when the capital fell to the enemy, it could not operate. It transferred valuable ancient books to Shanghai in advance. Five months ago, it selected No. 280 Simalu (opposite the Zhonghua Book Company) to reopen. Recently, due to many collectors entrusting the sale of ancient books after the war, it decided to expand its scope and set up a book collection department. It plans to enlarge the storefront soon to serve customers. The new catalog will be compiled this month and will be published successively in newspapers.</p>
<h3>Two Major Contributions of Shanghai Bao</h3>

In December of last year, it began publishing writers' love affairs. From New Year's Day this year, it added a *Shuihu Zhuan*-style novel, with the first group titled "Group of Orioles Compete for Treasure." The writers are all famous figures in the literary world, with ancient, lush, and rigorous writing styles and bizarre and interesting plots. In order to promote the newspaper, anyone who has not read it can request a sample copy by mail, which will be sent immediately for the most recent three days for trial reading. All newspaper stalls in the city sell it, with each copy costing four steel cents.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Past Year and Thoughts on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>— Xie Jinyuan</p>
<p>Time flies like water. The twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China (1939) has arrived in an instant. I have been admitted to the hospital for treatment due to mental unease. Following the doctor's orders, I have removed all distractions. However, colleagues in the media have requested that I write an article to express my observations of the past year. For a time, I could not comply. Recently, compatriots in the isolated island (Shanghai) have been constantly asking about the truth and future trends due to the rumours about Jing Weishi (Wang Jingwei)'s departure and frequent rumors. I have always been optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. I have said in the past that our country's military has absolute confidence in victory. If there are any problems, they are in politics. However, political problems are not beyond salvation. Because our country has a large population and a vast space, after a protracted war of resistance, we will be able to put all political problems on track with the development of the military. In particular, today's soldiers in our country are inspired by the fearless spirit of our Supreme Leader and the revolutionary education of the nation-state, which has made the thinking of modern soldiers advance by leaps and bounds. As for the past, in the Party-state, he only bears a part of the responsibility. The words and actions of the Ning-Han split and the measures taken at the enlarged meeting, as evidenced by today's departure, what it affects the cause of the war of resistance and national construction, at best, is to confuse people and give the enemy an opportunity to provoke and spread rumors.</p>
<p>I think that Shi (Wang Jingwei) is an idealist, lacking a strong and consistent revolutionary belief. Judging from his past revolutionary history, he may not abandon his compatriots and join the traitors. It is believed that at this critical juncture for the country, a few telegrams or lengthy speeches will not help. Shi's move is enough to expose the declining fate of a few wavering elements in the country and make the foundation of national unity and resistance to aggression stronger. I originally had an article "The Understanding That Nationals Should Have During the War of Resistance," which was to be published on New Year's Day, but it was unsuccessful due to illness. In short, the people in this great era should have an absolutely rational and calm mind to grasp beliefs and recognize right and wrong. If they are overly nervous and ignore reality, they will only fall into the old ills of frivolity, impetuosity, and empty talk that the Chinese people have had in the past. I hope that the media will work hard to take the lead in guiding public opinion and will not over-promote all kinds of confusing, untrue news and shake the people's confidence in the war of resistance. This all-out war of resistance was originally a consistent policy of the government. As early as five years ago, there was a detailed plan. Therefore, any words and actions of Shi are not enough to affect the national policy of war of resistance. This is only a clear division between the wise and the foolish in the process of war of resistance. Today, we must recognize that only by vowing to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will the war of resistance be won. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the only great man who has inherited the past and opened up the future, carrying forward the historical culture of our country for five thousand years, and the leader who has laid the foundation for the nation's eternal foundation. The people must recognize that the soul of the nation is tied to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's soul is the soul of our nation. From now on, the people can only follow the meaning of "the rise and fall of the country, everyone is responsible," and each guard their posts, do their best, take the Supreme Leader's advocacy as their own advocacy, their will as their own will, and work hard to serve the country in a down-to-earth manner. Compatriots on the isolated island, at the beginning of this year, I hope everyone will review the responsibilities they have fulfilled since the year and a half of the war of resistance. At the time when millions of soldiers are fighting to the death and tens of millions of compatriots in the war zone are displaced, can we on the isolated island use the special environment to watch the fire from across the river? I, who remain on the isolated island, sincerely appeal to the compatriots on the isolated island that the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China will be the year of our country's war of resistance and national construction. I deeply hope that all compatriots on the isolated island will step up their responsibility to repay the motherland, contribute money if they have money, and contribute strength if they have strength, in order to complete the foundation of national mobilization. It is believed that the one-yuan debt repayment movement is a duty that every citizen should fulfill, and it must be promoted universally, extending to the old and young. Then, gathering strength from all, accumulating sand into a tower, the combination of the strength of 450 million people will surely become a solid Great Wall. The future of the war of resistance will surely be victorious. Otherwise, the country will be destroyed, and the family will be ruined, and we may not even be able to become the second Jewish people. At the beginning of the new year, I deeply hope that my compatriots will encourage each other.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang Educator Xu Shizhu Commits Suicide by Drowning After His Nephew Joins the Rebels; Those Who Willingly Become Traitors Should Feel Ashamed to Death</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) Xu Shizhu, a Zhenjiang educator who once served as the director of the Dantu County Education Promotion Office and the director of the Zhenjiang County Education Bureau, was a native of Dagang Township, Zhenjiang. His morality and writings were always admired by his fellow villagers and people in society. Recently, because his nephew, Xu, joined the rebels in the township, he tried to dissuade him but failed. Considering it a great shame and humiliation, he committed suicide by drowning himself in the Xinzhou area a few days ago, sacrificing himself for the country. Those who willingly become traitors should feel ashamed to death. It is said that Mr. Xu showed considerable remorse upon learning that his uncle had committed suicide for the country.

<h3>The Misfortune of Jiangsu's Islamic Education; Most Islamic Schools in Various Counties Are Closed; Zhenjiang Muyuan Middle School Completely Bombed</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) In various counties of Jiangsu Province, such as Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, Jiangdu, Liuhe, Tongshan, Huaiyin, and Huaian, each county has one or two Islamic private primary schools of both higher and lower levels. Although nominally Islamic private schools, they enroll both Han and Muslim children, and the number of free places is greater than the number of paid places. Because the majority of the regular expenses of Islamic private schools, apart from a small amount subsidized by the county government or education bureau, come from donations from enthusiastic Muslims and the surplus of cattle donations from various places, the schools established by Muslims in various places generally have good results. The Muyuan School, a private Islamic school in Zhenjiang, can be considered the best in the province, with a long history of more than thirty years. The original founders were predecessors among the Muslim elders of Zhenjiang, who have long since passed away. In recent years, their descendants, such as Yang Gongya, Jin Zhuren, Yang Guangyu, Jin Shaoshan, and Tong Longshan, have tried hard to maintain and gradually expand it. Last spring, after Tong Renfu made a special trip to North China to investigate the state of Islamic education in various places and returned to the province, it was generally agreed that Zhenjiang, the capital of Jiangsu Province, needed to add an Islamic middle school. With the support of domestic and foreign Muslim celebrities, such as Professor Xue of the University of Chicago in the United States, who is also the President of the World Education Association, Zhong Wei Mai Siwude, General Bai Chongxi, and Chairman Ma Lin, preparations were actively underway. The Muyuan Elementary School was expanded, classrooms were added, and it was named Muyuan Middle School. All the equipment was mostly in place, and it was planned to start classes after the winter vacation last year. Unexpectedly, on the eve of the fall of Zhenjiang, Japanese planes completely bombed the school. The current director of the preparatory office, Yang Jifu, is still a fugitive and has not returned. Fortunately, a small portion of the funds is still in the bank and has not been touched. Recently, Yang Gongya and others, members of the Muyuan Middle School Preparatory Committee and the Muyuan Elementary School Board, plan to report the losses of the school to enthusiastic Muslims in the Northwest and work together to raise funds, hoping to find a way to start classes in Shanghai or a suitable location in the un-occupied area in a short period of time. In Zhenjiang, in addition to Muyuan, there are also Qingzhen Elementary School, Zhizhen Elementary School, and Qingzhen Girls' Elementary School. Currently, they are unable to hold classes because the classrooms or school sites and equipment have been occupied or damaged by the Japanese puppets. In addition, except for Huaiyin and Huaian counties, which have temporarily suspended classes due to the impact of the war, the rest were ravaged by the Japanese army, coerced, or burned during the occupation, and most of them are unable to hold classes. It will probably not be easy to recover for a while, which is truly the misfortune of Islamic education in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Guohua Middle School</h3>
<p>Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road in this city was established in July of the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. In the early days of its opening, it focused on practical subjects. In June of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], the first graduating class consisted of more than 30 people. In July of that year, Xiao Yuan became the principal. The high school department had two tracks, general studies and business studies, while the attached junior high school department was entirely general studies. He was determined to improve the school by expanding the campus, adding equipment, and increasing the number of books and instruments as much as possible, striving for perfection, and taking meeting educational principles and adapting to the students' physical and mental needs as the purpose of running the school. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], it was approved for registration by order of the Education Bureau. Since then, the school's foundation has become stronger day by day, and its reputation has grown day by day. Students from all over the world have come to the school in increasing numbers. In the summer of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], Principal Xiao served in other cities and had no time to take care of school affairs. At that time, the Shanghai branch of the alumni association of the National Nango Dongda Zhongda [National Southeastern University, National Tongji University, and National Central University] planned to set up a secondary school in this city, using the latest educational methods to cultivate talents for the country. Therefore, Hu Shuyi, a member of the standing committee of the association, contacted the principal of the school and, with the resolution of the board of directors, transferred the school to the association for management starting in January of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], and appointed Tian Ding'an as the successor principal. On October 12 of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the Shanghai branch of the alumni association of the National Nango Dongda Zhongda held the fourth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees. It was resolved that the school would be taken over by Hu Shuyi from the first semester of the 25th academic year and appointed as the standing director of the school. At the same time, Principal Tian resigned from his position as principal due to personal matters. Hu, the standing director, selected and appointed Wang Yuzhang as the concurrent principal. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the school has continued to hold classes because it is in a safe area. Later, Principal Wang went to Gan [Jiangxi], and Director Hu went to Dian [Yunnan]. The board of directors then elected Zhao Mianyun as the principal, Zheng Yimei as the director of academic affairs, Hu Situn as the director of discipline, and Xie Xianou as the director of general affairs. Thus, the organization was sound and the fortress was brand new. More than 30 well-known scholars in the country, such as Jiang Yinqiu, Lu Dan'an, Cheng Xiaoqing, Yan Yinwu, Ni Wenzhou, Pang Xiaolong, Jin Shiru, Wu Sanchi, Wang Zeping, and Gao Ti Ruo, Shen Qiwei were hired to take charge of academic affairs. The students all felt like they were sitting in the spring breeze. The school is divided into junior high school and senior high school. The senior high school has general studies and business studies and accepts both male and female students. It also has an attached Guohua Elementary School, which is a special elementary school of the Zhonghua Book Company. The school has 700 students, a football field, and a basketball field, all of which are very spacious. Students do extracurricular activities here in the morning and evening. As for management and education, the school insists on strictness. There are two small exams and one big exam every semester, which are quite strict.</p>

Students who have transportation difficulties or have already entered other schools may be exempted from traveling back and forth.

<h3>International Cup Football Preliminary: China United Hard-Fought Victory over England 3-1; Three Goals in a Row in the Second Half to Come From Behind; Meng Yiliang Temporarily Added as Left Forward</h3>
<p>In the preliminary round of the International Cup football match, the China United team met with England at Yiyuan yesterday. Nearly 10,000 spectators watched, and the grand occasion was no less than the Christmas charity match. China United came from behind and eliminated England with a score of 3-1, advancing to the second week. Because the China United center-back line still felt weak, a special election committee meeting was convened before the game, and it was passed that Meng Yiliang would be added as the left forward as proposed by Le Xiurong. England's Simmons was absent. After the start of the game, England's Watt was awarded a penalty kick and opened the scoring. In the second half, China United cheered up and showed great momentum. Sun Tie-tui [Iron Leg], Li Yichen, succeeded one after another, coming from behind. Finally, Dai Linjing scored a goal, and China United reversed the defeat with a score of 3-1.</p>
<p>China United Team:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Meng Yiliang, Xu Chengxun, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Cao Youliang</p>
<p>England:</p>
<p>Pi Shigu, Hai Liesun, Lugen, Jie Muwater, Jielai, Hui Sihute, Laiyin, Katepei, Bao Duke, Huatuosi, Paier</p>
<p>Penalty Kick, China United Falls Behind</p>
<p>The English team attacked first, but went deep into the hinterland and gained nothing. Before long, Xu Chengdong invaded and was penalized for a free kick. Hui Sihute tried a long shot, and Jiang Zhaoxiang stepped forward to block it. Paier attacked from the side and raised his foot to kick the door. Zhou Dayun lay down and saved it, rolling out not far away. Katepei caught up and pushed it, fortunately it went out of bounds. China United counterattacked, but without success. Bao Duke knocked on the door alone, and Zhou Dayun jumped up to catch it. At twelve minutes, Xu Chengxun elbowed someone and was penalized for a penalty kick. Watt kicked off and the ball flew into the net. China United lost a goal first. The English team took advantage of the situation and committed another crime, all of which were caught by Zhou Dayun. Zhuang Youren fouled, and Hui Sihe took a free kick from 25 yards, but was again saved by Zhou. The five forwards of China United worked hard to counterattack, but all failed. Hui Sihe once left the field due to injury and soon returned. At halftime, the English team estimated the yuan with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>Tie-tui Scores, Leveling the Score</p>
<p>The second battle began, and China United washed away the sluggishness of the first half. The English team was energetic and vigorous. Li Yichen was awarded a free kick. Because he was eager to win, he hit the ball with his hand and was kicked out by the opponent's goalkeeper. Xiao Wan sneaked in from the left and passed Tie-tui. Sun got the ball and shot. Pi Shigu failed to lift it out. Dai Linjing stopped the enemy general. Sun calmly shot again, and the iron leg started, and it went into the net. A tie of 1-1 was made, and the cheers were thunderous. It was only seven minutes before the continuation of the game. China United launched another siege. Pi Shigu took the ball out of danger in the chaos. Jinshun, Youliang, and Adai all had wonderful works, but unfortunately they all became pie in the sky. Youliang pounced on the enemy's goal again, and Pi Shigu fell to the ground in panic. Sun Tie-tui was half a step late and missed another good opportunity. Adai shot and forced a corner kick. Youliang opened it very well. Pi Shigu kicked out Tie-tui's cross, but Xiao Wan failed to catch up. China United had many opportunities, but none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>Three Goals in a Row, Everyone Is Happy</p>
<p>China United attacked repeatedly but failed, but its momentum did not diminish slightly. At seventeen minutes, Li Yichen got Youliang's hook and sent it from fifteen yards from the goal, a wonderful test of his superb skills. The ball flew into the corner of the goal, clear and beautiful. The whole place applauded. China United was ahead with a score of 2-1, and the generals became more enthusiastic. The English team counterattacked, and Laiyin knocked on the door, hitting Xu Chengxun and turning it into a corner kick. Laiyin opened it and sent it to Shi Dayun's hand. Hui Qihe shot from a distance, and Dayun lay down and pounced into the air. Bao Duke added a pick, fortunately it crossed the crossbar. At thirty-five minutes, Meng Yiliang blocked the ball, and the referee penalized a penalty kick. The audience shouted injustice. Watt shot wide, as if deliberately. In the last three minutes, Sun Tie-tui and Dai Lin rode side by side, passing each other, reaching the appropriate point. Adai kicked hard, and the English goal fell again. In a few minutes, the silver whistle rang for a long time, and China United eliminated England with a score of 3-1.</p>
<h3>Special Charity Football Match: Reporter Team Wins Referee Team 7-3 to Reclaim the French Business Cup</h3>
<p>A special charity football match, the reporter team vs. the referee team, was held at Yiyuan at 10:30 a.m. yesterday. The referee was Le Xiurong, and both players and referees purchased tickets to enter the arena. The income was one hundred and several tens of yuan. Among the Chinese participants, only Lu Zhongen was on the reporter team, while Liu Chunshu, Lu Shunde, Ni Xiaoben, and others were on the referee team. The match between the two sides was full of gimmicks, making people laugh. The reporters relied on better cooperation and scored three goals in a row, taking a 3-0 lead in the first half. After 6-2 in the second half, the referee goalkeeper defected, and the referee team actually got extra money. As a result, the reporter team won a big victory over the referee team with a score of 7-3. The "French Business Cup" that the referee team had preserved in the previous session was declared to have changed hands.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>"Half-Dice"</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>"Half-Dice" is a term used in "gang circles" and is a synonym for those "fickle" friends, so it is also a derogatory term.</p>
<p>The psychology, behavior, and speech of a "Half-Dice" are unpredictable. Sometimes he is very brave and enterprising, while at other times he is very timid and cowardly; sometimes he will generously sacrifice himself for righteousness, while at other times he will shamelessly serve the enemy; sometimes he will speak out for justice with eloquence, while at other times he will babble and deny the truth. In short, he has no backbone, no soul, no sense of justice. He is like a weak willow in the wind, a duckweed on the water, knowing only to follow the current.</p>
<p>What "gang circles" need are loyal and righteous fighters willing to endure "three cuts and six holes," so for those "fickle" "gang members," they are given the nickname "Half-Dice" so that the general "gang members" can identify them and impose appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p>Because of the shameful psychology, the base behavior, and the inconsistent speech of the "Half-Dice," he will be looked down upon by the general "gang members." However, in order to survive, he has to work hard in life skills, and cunning, treacherousness, and ruthlessness are his specialties. He will not only use cunning means to defraud his friends of their property, but also betray his friends and betray his "boss" under his selfish emotions. Therefore, the "Half-Dice" is not only shameful, but also deserves to be killed!</p>
<p>There are "Half-Dice" in "gang circles," and there are also "Half-Dice" in general society; and "Half-Dice" have existed since ancient times, but they are even more rampant today. Qin Hui's greed for wealth and power led him to rely on the Jin people to increase his own importance; Wu Sangui, for the sake of his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan, led the Qing troops into the pass; and the current batch of "funny" friends, puppets on stage, are all "Half-Dice" of the nation and the country. As for the petty merchants and below, there are even more "Half-Dice" than hairs on an ox, easily found everywhere, only differing in the degree of baseness and the amount of money they are after.</p>
<p>However, although the "Half-Dice" is cunning, treacherous, and ruthless, able to deceive for a time and live comfortably, he will only die when he encounters "righteousness" and "moral principles." Therefore, although the world is deteriorating now and everyone wants to be a "Half-Dice," no one wants to be a "Half-Dice." If someone is popular, has a history, has made considerable achievements, or has a considerable status, then even if they want to be a "Half-Dice," they would not dare to give up on themselves and become a "Half-Dice."</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions in reality. Those with history and achievements are now also trying to embark on the path of "Half-Dice"! Alas! If the "Half-Dice" does not die, there will be no righteousness in the world!</p>
<h3>Moving Forward Towards the Dawn of Victory</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, the people of the "isolated island" spent the last day of 1938 in a frenzy of dancing, fueled by the remaining energy of Christmas.</p>
<p>This is the second time celebrating the New Year on the "isolated island." The first New Year was just after the National Army's westward retreat and the fall of the capital. Shanghai was exactly like its newly added title, as desolate and bleak as an "isolated island." This New Year is clearly different, with the heat and hustle not inferior to pre-war times.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the people on the "isolated island" have completely forgotten their motherland? Naturally, we cannot deny that some people have become numb to the current environment; but it is definitely not the whole.</p>
<p>While frantically dancing the most popular "Lai Shan Bo" dance, the lights of the entire dance floor suddenly emitted a powerful glow, and in the distance, a bright chime was ringing—twelve o'clock, causing the musicians to stand up solemnly and play a familiar melody. The dancers, awakened by the music, could not help but sing the song "The Three Principles of the People, Our Party's Aim." A dance floor mixed with powder and sweat a second ago was now like a solemn holy land, with every patriotic heart and every drop of boiling blood seemingly detached from their bodies and flying to a distant world. In that world, our compatriots are fighting the enemy with blood and sweat to win the survival of our nation!</p>
<p>Only traitors with lost hearts and illnesses linger at the "Gates of Peace"! Nothing is more sorrowful than the death of the heart, but the hearts of the "isolated island" have not died!</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning of this new year, everyone should constantly remind themselves to stand firm and contribute every little bit of effort. The fatigue accumulated over the year has been compensated for by these three days of rest. From today onwards, we should be invigorated and do the work that every citizen should do, at least adhering to the creed of frugality and saving the nation, and not wasting precious money and sound spirits in useless places.</p>
<p>March forward towards the dawn of victory; the day we reach it will be the day we revel!</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Phoenix and Luan Companions</h3>
<p>— Baihua</p>
<p>The Girl of the Golden West produced by MGM, showing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre</p>
<p>Since "Phoenix Flying Together" and "Peach Blossom Hate," the separation of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy has left their audience with endless feelings of reluctance. "Phoenix and Luan Companions" can cooperate again, and as a New Year's screening, it naturally has no problem in terms of "box office appeal." But we should also remember "War Time Serenade" (starring Jeanette MacDonald and Allan Jones), which was also shown in Nanjing last year. Not only is the script authentic, but the director's excellent, lively, and coherent technique makes "Phoenix and Luan Companions" pale in comparison.</p>
<p>"Phoenix and Luan Companions" is a newly adapted Western, and the religious meaning is too strong. The repentance and reform of the brave and chivalrous thief Ray Maris (Nelson Eddy), who robs the rich and helps the poor, and the local official Luns Zhimanli (Jeanette MacDonald) sincerely loving Ray Maris, and "resolutely retiring and making good things happen," even if religion really has a transforming power, then this transforming power is not enough.</p>
<p>Director Robert Z. Leonard handles individual scenes with considerable vigor, but the whole play seems to be not tight enough in connection. At the beginning, it makes people feel very dull, which is mostly due to the trivial story and the inability to properly adjust time and space.</p>
<p>Nelson Eddy does not seem to be very suitable for playing this type of role. Riding high and wearing a wide hat, there seems to be a stereotypical figure in Hollywood. This is also the biggest loss of "Phoenix and Luan Companions." But the director still succeeded in portraying the crude but lovely character of the Western people and the rich local colors.</p>
<p>For example, in the scene where Manli participates in the festival, starting from Ray Maris intercepting the officer's uniform, pretending to be Lieutenant John, and rushing to the meeting, the crazy Spanish dance and Eddy's loud singing, the atmosphere of that scene is extremely tense. The greatness of the scene and the activity of the camera are even more trivial. Manli's singing in the church is also a rare lively shot.</p>
<p>The most moving scenes are the following. On Manli's birthday, the local official Luns sent her a piano. The old professor played the piano, Manli sang, and everyone sang in harmony, and Luns also revealed his heartfelt happiness; later, Manli agreed to marry Luns. Before going to the church to get married, the old professor still played the piano, but she was already sobbing and could not speak. In contrast, the director tightly controlled the emotions at the time.</p>
<p>The scene where Ray Maris and Manli made an appointment to dine together in a wooden house was also the same. After Ray Maris was shot and injured, Luns tracked him down, and Manli hid him in the attic, but when they shook hands, the blood stains on the attic just dripped on his hand. Later, gambling was used to decide the marriage, and he was found cheating, and finally he married Luns on the condition of releasing Ray Maris. In the process of "love and death struggle," not only the director's skills are surpassed, but Jeanette MacDonald also performed very well in the psychological conflict of not being able to "have both."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Hang Qi Master</p>
<p>Female Ballad Singer (5)</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I recalled that there are also many descriptions of female ballad singers in the "Bamboo Branch Poems." For example, Bang Jiang's "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Poems" says: "Singing ballads is called the female pioneer, a young and beautiful girl has just arrived from Suzhou. Holding the pipa halfway to cover her face, smiling and lowering her head to learn how to toss coins." This proves that although female ballad singers were mostly from Changshu in the early days, later people from all over Suzhou also learned it.</p>
<p>Yunqi Layman's "Yang Chang Ballad Poems," in his "Ballad" poem, says: "The heavenly girl ascends the platform to compose music, a wonderful and unmasked meeting. The sound of Sheng and song reaches the ears, and the fragrance of silk and satin secretly arises, captivating the soul. With solemn makeup and bright candles, carefully present the clapper and golden wine cup. This is the ultimate beauty of the world, and from now on I no longer envy dancing neon clothes." This, together with Shen Jiang Old Master's "Thirty Good Things of Shen Jiang," which says: "Shen Jiang is good, the names of the bookstores are marked. Excluding men, women are respected, only talking about strings and not Sheng and Xiao, day after day," and the "Shanghai North-South Bamboo Branch Rhymes," which says: "The ballad girl has a beautiful face, casually turning the sandalwood groove to reveal her finger ring. The most affectionate is her pretended smile, gently shaking the painted fan to tidy up her hair," all demonstrate that the so-called "female ballad singers" and the audience's understanding of them were mostly not for storytelling and listening to stories.</p>
<p>"Shanghai North-South Bamboo Branch Rhymes" also says: "A pipa song captivates all present, the beauty is also called Mr., who is the most outstanding among them, Wu Suqing and Huang Aiqing," and "Jingting's legacy is enough to please, it is rare to say books clearly tomorrow. Yuan's tune is high and Yan's tune is stable, if you talk about demeanor, give way to the three Zhus," and it is noted: "The female book speakers, Yuan Yunxian and Yan Lizhen are the best. The three Zhus are Sulan, Suqing, and Youxiang." And it is enough to supplement the lack of "A Small Record of Female Ballad Singers" by Chi Ping Sou. Character evaluation poems, this book contains the most, it was published in the second year of Guangxu (1876), and the author was about the same time as Chi Ping Sou. The evaluation poem says:</p>
<p>Wang Lijuan—Heaven has repeatedly descended the Fairy of Book Holding, Wang Lijuan should be pushed as the leader. A kind of elegance and high style, why is it necessary to let Cheng Lian move his feelings.</p>
<p>Yuan Yunxian—The book arena is noisy with setting sun dogs, the owner of the hall and the official all cooperate. When the report arrives, Mr. Oil Bi will arrive, everyone looks at Yunxian with green eyes.</p>
<p>Zhu Youxiang—Brilliant and innocent Zhu Youxiang, the small pipa pluck has a beautiful sound. Jiao Han also has the intention of relying on others, it is good to be reserved next to the mother.</p>
<p>Wang Youjuan—Youjuan is extremely intelligent, the light smile and frown are even more pitiful. Weak body, how can you bear to be too thin, do not let Tingting stand in the wind.</p>
<p>Yan Lizhen—The old elegant Yan Lizhen, a glance when she enters the arena seems to be affectionate. People compete to listen to the Wa Pao vegetarian, the words are clear in the sound of strings.</p>
<p>Chen Yue'e—Could it be that Su'e was demoted from the Moon Palace, traveling in the mortal world to remember Jiao Ge. The ice string plays towards the dissolving moon, and there is much hatred in the sad voice.</p>
<p>Zhu Sulan—Sulan's Beijing tune is also worthy of praise, the clear singing is lingering and butterflies are obsessed. There is also a Yangqin that pushes uniqueness, singing the waves washing the sand.</p>
<p>Xu Yayun—Phoenix eyes and moth eyebrows Xu Yayun, Tingting is like a crane standing in a flock of chickens. Wu Niang's evening rain, Xiao Xiao tune, will be heard again when she returns to Jiangfu.</p>
<p>Qian Yaxiang—Chang Yan presses the beat to help pour the cup, the chirping warbler sound surrounds the painted beams. It is Yaxing who sings elegant tunes, and the pipa accidentally picks Zhou Lang.</p>
<p>Xu Shiyu—The gentle singing voice is a new tune, and Xu Niang is still in the dust when she is half old. The book building rashly said that she met Qinglai, who knows the jade body of that year.</p>
<p>Shi Yuelan—Xianya is dignified and lets Yuelan, the demeanor of everyone sits in the book world. Yangchun's song is heard by everyone, don't treat it as a common example.</p>
<p>Chen Aiqing—Casually pluck the sandalwood groove and there is affection, and strange sounds come out to break the intestines. Why do people prefer to sing in Ba dialect, I know there is Aiqing in our book arena.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village, Twin Girls Reverently Visit the Cemetery of Martyrs</p>
<p>He replaced the summer and winter vacations of those schools in the city with these two busy farming seasons, but when the schools in the city had summer and winter vacations, he did not take a vacation. Then what does he do during the busy farming season? He is also a country person, doesn't he have any fields? How can he not have them? He and his brother have more than 20 acres of private land. Because his brother is deceased, he gave the land to his two nephews to farm. When they are really too busy, he will come and help, directing them, and that is enough. Besides, he still spends most of his time in the small teahouse, and he stays there even more during the busy farming season. But he also has many things to do in the small teahouse: one is to read and write letters for people, because at that time, many people in the countryside did not know how to read, especially rural women. A Da's mother works as a helper in Suzhou; A Er's grandfather works in a factory in Shanghai. When letters arrive, they always have to be taken to the small teahouse to ask the teacher to read them to them. In turn, they ask the teacher to write a reply. His colloquial letters are much smoother and clearer than those of the fortune-telling gentlemen in the city. He doesn't ask for any reward, but the country people naturally pick pumpkins and send him a big one; they cook dishes and send him two bowls to eat. The second thing is that he often tells the public news in the small teahouse, because a friend in the village works as a clerk in a cloth factory in the city. That cloth factory reads a Shen Bao, and throws it away after reading it. He finds a way to pay a few cents for postage to send the Shen Bao that he has read to the countryside. Although the days have already passed three or four days, it is still fresh in the countryside, after all, it is news. Many people hold up at the small teahouse, there is nothing else, when they are free, they always play mahjong. Two hundred chips, three hundred chips, just keep shoveling them down. Even to the point of fighting because they lost money, teapots and benches flying together. However, that kind of atmosphere has not yet prevailed in his small teahouse. Many people who sit in the teahouse just talk and talk. Or tell some stories, not escaping the humor of idle talk in a melon shed. Everyone also pesters this country teacher to tell them the news published in the newspaper. What people are in power in the government now, what kind of person has recently replaced the county magistrate, how much will the discounted price of rent rice be per stone this year. In a small teahouse, they also discuss national affairs and local administration. Don't look at it as a small newspaper, it can increase a lot of knowledge among the country people. (3)</p>

<h3>The Suffering of Japanese Cotton Mills from the Tianjin Cotton Monopoly</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wu</p>
<p>At the end of last year, a new development emerged in the foreign cotton trade in this city, namely that various Japanese factories in Shanghai have been purchasing large quantities of American and Brazilian cotton. This abnormal situation has attracted considerable attention from the cotton industry. Since the Japanese government has vigorously implemented a policy of strong economic control, strictly limiting the people from purchasing European and American raw materials, it is surprising that the Japanese factories in Shanghai are now ordering large quantities of foreign cotton for textile use. The reason for this abnormal phenomenon is definitely not solely based on the fall in the price of foreign cotton; the actual factors are driven by various environmental pressures.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, in order to strengthen its wartime finances, Japan has been trying to open up new avenues for economic trade, using its consistent policy of controlling all trade in our guerrilla areas through both military force and economic means, in order to support the development of Japanese businesses in the areas temporarily occupied by the Japanese army. Especially in the cotton spinning industry, it has used the counterfeit currency of the puppet organizations and the military notes issued by the Japanese military affairs department to absorb as much legal currency as possible in the Japanese-occupied areas, and then used the legal currency to purchase cotton from various regions for the consumption of the Japanese cotton mills. Therefore, since the resumption of work after the war, the raw cotton used by the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai has largely been cotton from the North China region.</p>
<p>However, recently, due to the increased demand for Tianjin cotton, the price has been increasing daily, and the exchange rate between Shanghai and Tianjin has also risen due to the need for legal currency in North China. Furthermore, on the other hand, in order to strengthen the credit of the puppet currency of the United Reserve Bank of North China, the Japanese authorities have been vigorously devaluing the legal currency circulating in various parts of North China, stipulating that every hundred yuan of legal currency is equivalent to eighty yuan of the puppet currency of the United Reserve Bank of North China. Under such circumstances, it is the same as raising the price of North China cotton, resulting in a sharp decrease in the amount of Tianjin cotton shipped to Shanghai due to the significant price difference. Moreover, since December 1st, the Japanese military has instructed the "Provisional Government" of Peiping to strictly prohibit the export of cotton and implement cotton price controls. As a result, various Japanese factories have felt the pain of a lack of raw cotton supply. Under these unmanageable circumstances, they have had to purchase foreign cotton to meet their urgent need for raw materials.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, Japan has needed a huge amount of cotton for manufacturing munitions. Its domestic economic strength is weak. It has no huge amount of gold to export to exchange for foreign raw cotton. So Japan's only way is to collect cotton in the guerrilla areas of China and transport it back to Japan for domestic consumption. Therefore, in order to purchase cotton from these areas at a limited price, the Japanese government authorities used the name of the "Provisional Government" to implement control. Because North China cotton production could not be transported out, the price of cotton plummeted. The Japanese government took the opportunity to devalue the currency and transport all the North China cotton production, except for local consumption, to Japan. This has indeed dealt a major blow to the raw material supply of the Japanese-owned cotton mills in this city. According to statistics, in the past three months, the amount of Chinese cotton transported to Japan has reached as much as 1.5 million dan. In fact, this number does not yet include the figures for exports to Japan after the ban on cotton exports was announced on December 1st. However, the amount of cotton needed by Japan is still far from this number. Therefore, Japan hopes to continue to absorb as much as possible in the various guerrilla areas to meet its domestic needs.</p>
<p>However, in the past few months, the transportation of cotton from the cotton-producing areas in North China to various places has increased due to the improved trade in cloth in various places, the resumption of work in various cotton mills, and the increasing number of new spindles installed. On the other hand, the cotton-producing areas have shrunk due to the war situation. Under this state of demand exceeding supply, the price of cotton has risen sharply. At this time, Japan's plan to absorb Chinese cotton at a low price has encountered great obstacles. Therefore, it prohibits exports, so that all the cotton is hoarded in various regions, allowing it to fall in price on its own. Japan can then purchase and transport the low-priced cotton to Japan as it wishes. Whether this kind of means can achieve its effect, we can hardly determine, but at present, the Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai are in a greater panic about the supply of raw cotton because of the implementation of this cotton production control.</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, the Japanese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai have no other way to remedy the cut off raw cotton supply except to purchase American cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Indian cotton.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current phenomenon of raw material supply shortages in various Japanese cotton mills is enough to show the extreme tightness of funds in various Japanese factories. According to the general situation, any cotton mill, according to the usual practice, should have at least three to six months' worth of raw cotton reserves. From this point of view, even if there is a temporary shortage of raw materials, there should be no problems, and the stored cotton can be used to wait for future purchases to replenish it. However, in fact, various Japanese-owned cotton mills, because their home government needs to raise funds for national war expenditures, have repeatedly decided to levy heavy "patriotic taxes." Therefore, although their operations are showing a significant surplus, their circulating funds are mostly showing a difficult phenomenon. They can only purchase raw materials at any time and use them for weaving. There is no huge amount of funds to purchase and store cotton. Therefore, at this time, they have to purchase foreign cotton as the only remedy.</p>
<p>In summary, under this special state of interruption of the North China source, the shipment of foreign cotton to Shanghai will inevitably increase day by day.</p>
<h3>The Anglo-American Trade Agreement and the Trade Relationship Between Britain and Canada</h3>
<p>According to the December report of the Royal Bank of Canada (TheRoyal Bank of Canada), the newly announced trade agreements between the United States and Canada and between Britain and the United States make it easy to imagine the significance of their commercial relationship. The United States and Canada initially concluded a trade agreement in November 1935, which was implemented on January 1 of the following year for a period of three years. During these three years, the commerce between the two countries was greatly stimulated. After the old agreement expired, a new one was concluded. The conclusion of this new agreement will further promote the commercial development of the two countries, which can be expected.</p>
<p>According to official U.S. statistics, Canada's exports to the United States in 1935 were US$286 million, and imports from the United States were US$323 million. Therefore, the U.S. trade surplus was US$37 million. In 1936, the first year of the implementation of the U.S.-Canada trade agreement, Canada's export trade increased to US$376 million. This was because the United States suffered from drought that year, which led to a sharp increase in the export of Canadian wheat, livestock, and other agricultural products to the United States. In addition, the export of industrial supplies such as timber also saw a large increase, especially in British Columbia. At the same time, U.S. exports to Canada also increased, but the amount was not large. The total amount exported to Canada that year was US$384 million. Therefore, the export volume of the two countries was almost equal, with a difference of only US$8 million. The following year, in 1937, U.S. exports to Canada increased significantly compared to the previous year, reaching a total of US$510 million, an increase of US$126 million. Canada's exports were US$399 million, an increase of US$23 million. The U.S. trade surplus with Canada that year was US$111 million, while it was only US$8 million in the previous year. Later, the U.S. economy declined, and agricultural production was abundant, which led to a sharp decline in Canadian goods exported to the United States. This trend continued in 1938. In the first eight months of 1938, Canada's products exported to the United States fell to US$162 million, while in the same period last year it was US$279 million. On the other hand, U.S. goods exported to Canada maintained their good condition, amounting to US$323 million, while in the same period last year it was US$336 million. Therefore, in 1938, the U.S. trade surplus with Canada reached US$161 million.</p>
<p>The commerce between the United States and Canada occupies an important position in their foreign trade. Why? Looking at the total export volume of the United States and Canada in 1930, the combined total was more than US$100 million, of which US exports to Canada were US$659 million, and Canadian exports to the United States were US$402 million. During the years of U.S. economic decline, the trade between the two countries also saw a sharp decline. However, during the nine years from 1930 to 1938, the total export volume of the two countries was US$650 million, of which US exports to Canada were US$375 million, and Canadian exports to the United States were US$275 million. From this point of view, in the total amount of U.S. foreign trade, Canada accounts for one-seventh of its export volume, and in terms of the total U.S. trade surplus, the trade surplus with Canada alone, at US$100 million, accounts for one-quarter of the total trade surplus.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the total amount of U.S. trade with Britain is not as large as that with Canada, the annual average total amount from 1930 to 1938 was US$569 million, of which U.S. exports to Britain were US$460 million, and British exports to the United States were US$141 million. The largest portion of U.S. exports to Britain was raw cotton. For example, in the year from July 1937 to July 1938, Britain purchased US$85 million worth of U.S. cotton, which exceeded more than twice the amount of cotton purchased from the United States by any other country in the world (France was in second place with US$40 million). In the past nine years, the U.S. trade surplus with Britain has averaged US$287 million per year. The world knows that Britain is a country with a large trade deficit, but it may not be fully known to the world that U.S. goods account for a large portion of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>During the above nine years, the U.S.'s total export volume averaged US$380 million per year. Within this figure, U.S. exports to Canada were nearly US$100 million, and exports to Britain reached US$287 million. In other words, the U.S. has had a trade surplus every year for nine years, which can be said to be purely due to these two countries.</p>
<p>Although the United States and Canada bear a great responsibility in terms of trade conditions, on the other hand, many Americans travel to Canada and spend a lot of money, which makes Canada's balance of payments with the United States more favorable. Therefore, if this "trade created by travel" is included, since 1931, the U.S. has purchased more Canadian goods annually than Canada has purchased U.S. goods. By the same token, the United States pays a large amount of money to Britain for shipping, insurance, etc. Therefore, in the final conclusion of the two countries, Britain's commercial situation is much better than that estimated based solely on export trade.</p>
<p>In modern times, all countries consider the amount of their export trade to determine the increase or decrease in import volume. Therefore, the balance of trade is particularly important. If the world were not the world it is today, but an ideal world, free from the constraints of tariff policies and other commercial restrictions, then according to economic principles, a country would purchase goods from the market with the lowest prices and sell goods to the market with the highest prices. Therefore, even if a country has an imbalance of payments, it would not be a major issue. Why? Other multilateral interrelationships can quickly compensate for its shortcomings. However, under the commercial policies dominated by nationalism, this problem becomes more serious. During each Imperial Conference, various departments of the British government are eager to obtain a larger share of the domestic market. However, Argentina, Sweden, Norway, and other countries are large purchasers of British goods. Therefore, when Britain controls the quantities of its various imperial departments, it cannot ignore these countries. Since Britain absorbs such a large and huge amount of exports from various countries in the world, its various imperial departments and other countries have made significant concessions to obtain priority in their imports to Britain. Therefore, if Britain wants to continue to buy the U.S.'s surplus products, the limited amount of imports from other countries will inevitably become narrower.</p>
<p>Britain has made huge overseas investments. Therefore, Britain has recognized for many years that a trade deficit is necessary, because purchasing goods from abroad can enable other countries to fulfill the payment of the benefits due from their investments. Due to this concession, Britain has obtained better loan benefits than other countries. Emerging countries mostly lack resources. Therefore, when commerce is sluggish, the maintainers of world financial stability must be the advanced countries with abundant resources. If countries can promote international trade in good faith, without restrictions, and without interfering with trade surpluses, allowing free entry and exit, they will surely reduce the current world difficulties greatly. The result will be that emerging countries can continue to fulfill their debt obligations. During this period, Britain has always been in a position of a large trade deficit without concern. Its great contribution to the revival of world commerce is by no means shallow. However, the recovery of world commerce will ultimately benefit Britain's foreign trade and make progress. (A)</p>
<h3>Finance: Major Wire Near-Long Term Steady</h3>
<p>London Electric Telegram on the 31st: Due to the holiday, the silver market had limited transactions. Some people came to cover short positions, but the market was still stable. The major wire near-term continued to rise 0.0625, and the long-term remained unchanged. Also, according to a New York telegram, the price of U.S. silver has a market but no trading. The spot price remains the same as before. Furthermore, according to a Bombay telegram, the Indian silver market is stable, and the spot and near-long term prices have not changed.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Remain Tight</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was good yesterday. The guild's price assessment for No. 24 Dutch coarse white sugar from the Blue Funnel warehouse was once assessed at 24 yuan and 3 jiao. Sugar from this warehouse was 24 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. Re-exported sugar was 16 yuan and 1 jiao. The spot price of Taikoo refined white sugar for delivery at Pudong warehouse was assessed at 23 yuan and a half. Later, the price was called up to 23 yuan and 8 jiao, but no transaction was made. Lower-grade HX mark sugar was 23 yuan and 4 jiao, and there were some transactions. The Chao Gang offered high cotton red sugar at 15 yuan and 2 jiao, a good start with an increase of 2 jiao, and ordinary sugar at 13 yuan and a half. The Shang Mian white sugar was 23 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao. The Jian Gang offered Shilu road red sugar at 14 yuan and 7 jiao and a half to 6 jiao, and Shilu foreign sugar at 15 yuan and a half. The asking price for Shangzhuang Quan white sugar was tighter, and the market trend may slightly rebound.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tin Plate Shortage Turns Upbeat</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the source of tin plate has been scarce. For example, Ganzhou tin, Jianghua tin, Hengdi tin, and small tin have either become war zones or cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to transportation difficulties. Therefore, the inventory in this port has been in short supply. Fortunately, the outgoing route is not very smooth, so the market price has not soared wildly except for a steady increase. Recently, due to a certain company's purchasing, spot goods are extremely scarce, and the market is soaring. For example, Xiaogeng tin opened at 370 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous price. Dutch tin was 395 yuan, also an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous price. Other rolled bar tin with a purity of 99 or above also opened at 390 yuan. All other solder tin and bucket tin are trending upwards. However, there is very little goods on the market, so the market sentiment is exceptionally optimistic.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sun-Dried Meat Rises by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, a total of 36 pieces of sun-dried meat have arrived. Yesterday, they were all sold out, with an increase of one yuan compared to the previous price, and distributed through various firms. It is said that there will not be many more goods arriving.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Excretion</h3>
<p>— Ding San</p>
<p>Our excretion, urination, and sweating are the excretion of waste materials from inside the body. If these waste materials accumulate, they will not only prevent the absorption of nutrients, but also become toxic substances, making the entire body weak.</p>
<p>Toxic substances in the body sometimes lurk inside, causing internal diseases; sometimes they come out, causing external diseases. To treat internal diseases, one must promote bowel movements and sweating; to treat external diseases, one must cut and treat sores and boils; in short, it still depends on excretion first.</p>
<p>The structure of a political society is somewhat similar to the structure of an individual's physiology, although they cannot be mechanically regarded as the same. Inside, there are also nutrients—healthy components—and waste—corrupt components. To make a nation strong, one must naturally, from the structure of the political society, relentlessly eliminate corrupt components and introduce healthy components.</p>
<p>Waste materials in the political and social structure will similarly prevent the absorption of nutrients; and if they are allowed to grow and develop, the result will inevitably be toxic substances. These toxic substances sometimes lurk in the dark, carrying out their destructive effects, causing hidden illnesses in the nation; sometimes they are openly released, carrying out their ulcerative effects, causing external illnesses in the nation. To treat this kind of disease, the whole country must have keen awareness, and wage a merciless struggle against the toxic substances transformed from those waste materials, eliminating them and cutting them away!</p>
<p>However, perhaps some people will ask, wouldn't doing this split the unity of the nation? Then, I would also ask in return: Doesn't your excretion, urination, sweating, or cutting away rotten flesh from sores and boils, split the unity of your body? Is this question valid? No! Because not excreting waste and toxic substances will not only fail to strengthen unity, but will also damage unity; excreting waste and toxic substances is precisely eliminating the components that harm unity, in order to absorb more and strengthen the components of unity, so as to make the nation stronger!</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not worry excessively that some corrupt components entrenched in the political and social structure are being continuously purged, considering it a division of unity, but rather we should rejoice that it is a strengthening of unity.</p>
<p>Our country's war of resistance against Japan this time, from an internal point of view, is precisely a general excretion, which is also called a general liquidation. In the war of resistance, the waste materials and toxic substances accumulated in the political and social structure over the past few years—separatist warlords, corrupt officials, and traitors—have all revealed their true colors and been eliminated; at the same time, the progressive elements who are determined to resist Japan, courageous, active, and hard-working, have been absorbed and introduced; making our country's war of resistance unity, because of the qualitative change, become increasingly strong!</p>
<p>The more intense the war of resistance, the easier it is for those waste materials and toxic substances to be exposed, and the easier it is to excrete them at the same time. This is by no means a bad phenomenon, but precisely a good phenomenon. Eliminating them is by no means dividing unity, but rather strengthening unity. We should not be pessimistic about this, but rather be optimistic about it, and we should also step up the work of excretion, so that our resistance forces become stronger; only then can we strive for the final victory in the war of resistance and national reconstruction!</p>
<h3>The Happy Jin Family Village</h3>
<p>— Xu Qi</p>
<p>"Ah! What a crowd!" Little Mao's mother, carrying a bucket of water, hobbled into the door, her teeth could no longer hold back the sound coming from her hoarse throat.</p>
<p>Little Mao's father was not there, which made her excitement turn into a burst of disappointment. She muttered:</p>
<p>"Damn it! Where did he go? So early in the morning..."</p>
<p>Little Mao sat under the stove, the stove hole was not yet lit, but it was always so warm. She sang softly: Wearing colored hemp strips, green here, yellow there.</p>
<p>"They arrived as soon as the first cock crowed!" Sister-in-law Aqi's bad-breathed mouth was always spraying towards Little Mao's mother. She showed off the glory of knowing early.</p>
<p>The sun, like a big red persimmon, was thrown from behind the mountain to the top of the mountain. The frost at the end of November was covered with a layer of gold. Today, the entire Jin Family Village was filled with vitality and joy. Even the big-bellied pigs were pacing out step by step, looking quite serene.</p>
<p>"Cook rice, do housework, three meals only need one bundle of firewood!"</p>
<p>"Little Mao!"</p>
<p>Little Mao jumped up and hugged her mother's leg. Her mother lightly tapped her forehead.</p>
<p>"Good girl! Mom will take you to see the excitement, ah! So many soldiers!"</p>
<p>"But are the yellow-clothed dwarf soldiers here again?" Little Mao had a shiver.</p>
<p>"Little girl! This time they are green-clothed soldiers. They are all tall. The yellow-clothed soldiers don't dare to come anymore!"</p>
<p>Little Mao held her mother's clothes and ran out. Little Mao's mother, hobbling, couldn't go fast. Little Mao was anxious and walked on one foot, more than ten feet away from her mother.</p>
<p>"Oh! What a crowd!"</p>
<p>The neighbors were chatting and laughing while chewing on sorghum cakes. In the field, under the shed, sat many old folks whom they had not seen for many days. They were still so quiet, amiable, and happy. Also, horses were smelling the soil under the elm trees with a snorting sound. On the field artillery, they all</p>
<p>They talked for a long time like old friends reunited. The cook used agile means to cook breakfast, comically blackening his face and hands. White steam rose in gusts, mixed with the sound of talking.</p>
<p>"They came from Village X!"</p>
<p>"Village X! More than a hundred li away!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing to us. We can rush the journey of three or four days in one breath."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The children mixed in with them and called to play. Little Mao climbed onto the back of a fat soldier who almost couldn't wear his military hat.</p>
<p>"Little baby! Come down, I'll teach you to sing!" Entangled so that he couldn't do anything, he lifted Little Mao down. Little Mao sat on his lap, stroking his Qing Tian Bai Ri hat badge.</p>
<p>"Come! Come! Come! Everyone come together! Regardless of men, women, old or young, pick up hoes and sickles! We are not afraid of planes and artillery, ××! ××! Don't you run away!"</p>
<p>Little Mao learned to sing, babbling. Little Mao's mother, suppressing her hoarse throat, told her not to be naughty. Little Mao didn't hear at all.</p>
<p>In that song, Little Mao's father came with a group of people, carrying full loads of things. Lame Old Ba and silly Ah San carried a newly slaughtered pig, shoulder to shoulder, staggering from side to side. The village chief was like a short pier. Today, he put on a mandarin jacket. His face was as swollen as a pig's liver. He said in a string:</p>
<p>"Everyone, thank you for your hard work! Thank you for coming to our village. This is just a little respect, but it really doesn't count, it really doesn't count!"</p>
<p>An officer stood up quite politely to greet the village chief. He was very young, with a delicate face, and still wearing a pair of leather gloves.</p>
<p>"There! There! Your things are all earned with sweat. How can we accept them without deserving it? We don't touch the people's grass or trees wherever we pass. You just remember, you see us, you have freedom, you can live a good life again, the enemy will never come again, your area is our sphere of influence. Now, take these things back! It's not easy for you either..."</p>
<p>Little Mao's father and his group put down their things and walked away, making the young officer keep waving his hands.</p>
<p>Jin Family Village became a paradise, full of laughter and peace. There was no line between them, all like brothers born of the same mother.</p>
<p>Above their heads was a blue sky, the sun illuminating the fields. The women released the chickens and sheep with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Little Mao opened her small mouth and sang:</p>
<p>"Come! Come! Come! Everyone come together! Regardless of men, women, old or young, pick up hoes and sickles..."</p>
<p>The fat soldier couldn't sit still with laughter and fell to the ground.</p>
<h3>Pastoral Atmosphere</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but recently, I’ve often felt a longing for the countryside.</p>
<p>As a result of this longing, I feel even more reluctant to let go of the countryside; moreover, its 'fragrance becomes clearer the farther away' !</p>
<p>I can't even remember why I left her so cruelly in the first place. Now, I just feel a sense of desolation and loneliness for not smelling the countryside's air even for a day! Although this is just empty sadness, the fact that I have failed her is already beyond words.</p>
<p>Alas! Alas! China! China! Such a vast China, ninety-nine percent of it still lies in the countryside – no matter how much the cities put on airs on your behalf.</p>
<p>It's been another year since I left the lovely countryside under the bright sun; I finally managed to get a small corner of the city, and I presumptuously thought I could live on, but how could I? What was the point, actually?</p>
<p>Therefore, the arrows of guilt are densely concentrated on the target of my heart, and they increase day by day.</p>
<p>Countryside! Although I have been away for a long time; your breath, although it may not necessarily drift over here, however, I know: the teasing, lingering affection, and breath, must still be brewing there; even if there is scorched earth in the way, it still tugs at the traveler's heart.</p>
<p>The golden rapeseed flowers, the wings of the wind winnowed from the wheat heads, all of this, I am a little afraid to mention again – afraid! Because I am afraid that mentioning it will cause me to shed more tears. However, the uncontrollable 'sound of rice threshing carried by the wind under the moon' floats to my mind again! Although I use three-dimensional buildings to disperse all of this, and let streamlined cars carry it away, I am still caught off guard by the crescent moon in the sky on the seventh evening of the month, which still constantly mocks the traveler's incomplete heart, and also casts many eerie shadows.</p>
<p>The air of the countryside, I can't smell it.</p>
<p>Here, unfolds a wave of people chasing the tide, a batch goes by, and a new batch comes again. True, their shoetips, their hemlines, still bring the dust of the countryside, and even permeate the air of the countryside. But, do you think you can rely on this little bit to comfort your withered heart? No, definitely not; it will disappear immediately.</p>
<p>This disappearance, is probably due to the dryness. But the anemic vegetable roots can still be bitten, although the electrocuted vegetables and fruits, are also worth chewing on, aren't they? Don't believe it, vitamins X, Y, Z, all adapt to the needs of the environment and become particularly 'full of divergent opinions'! Although 'no one can agree', one still has to enthusiastically shout: 'This is the food of mankind!' The carp that has climbed the Dragon Gate – actually 'retreated halfway back to the court' – stares blankly, its white eyes fixed, although it still has a bit of the 'remaining power that shakes the different tribes', but its fins and scales are straight, allowing people to pull open its worrisome gills, and it can't spit out any bubbles necessary for life, and it 'collapses' on the vegetable vendor's stall! This is truly a wonderful exotic landscape.</p>
<p>I am suffocating, I can't breathe in fresh air, let's go back, let's go back. What am I doing messing around here.</p>
<h3>Entering the City (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>"I'll go home and get it."</p>
<p>"It's getting late! I heard that they changed the city gate closing time to five o'clock today, earlier, huh, what would you know?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it because the foreign bridge on the highway at Dakanzi was burned down by the guerrillas? I know a little."</p>
<p>A group of us抢着问：</p>
<p>"What? Didn't the guerrillas run away long ago – they just set up the kerosene, and were driven away by ××, didn't they run away early?"</p>
<p>The old man搶先回答：</p>
<p>"You don't know, the people of Dakanzi are brave enough! They are all heroes! The guerrillas went, I heard, four of them, they had told the heroes in the village long ago, that they would destroy that bridge, ×× didn't know the guerrillas went, and there were also people from the village. The heroes will do the guerrillas' work for them. As soon as ×× left, hundreds of hands piled up more than a dozen barrels of kerosene, and a foreign bridge, just finished, they are really united."</p>
<p>I試探地问：</p>
<p>"Such a good bridge, isn't it a pity to burn it down!"</p>
<p>The old man and the young man搖搖頭, 異口同聲地說</p>
<p>"It's good to burn it down! Now the bridge is not ours, their trucks, tanks, drive back and forth all day, passing over that bridge, loading soldiers, loading bullets, killing us, what do we need this bridge for?"</p>
<p>The sparks of anger burst out on the faces of two innocent people, making me feel sad, touched, and respectful.</p>
<p>那年轻的小伙激動地，張開粗的手臂，告訴我們說：</p>
<p>"The four guerrillas who went to Dakanzi were really brave! They stood up to ××'s patrol, and deceived them with a few pistols. Four people! Only four people! Did such a big thing! I heard that one of them, got a bullet in his arm, that's so pitiful! I don't know if he's crippled or not?..."</p>
<p>I secretly pushed 老張, I smiled mysteriously, 老王 and 老林 also smiled at him. 老張呢,嘻开鲸鱼嘴, 扁着嘴对我们笑. I think, greater pain is逼着我们, he should forget the smaller pain, right.</p>
<p>松树林那边，发出喜悦的声音来了。嗤嗤牙牙！嗤嗤牙牙！酒鬼王三的一张酒糟脸，挺在树干旁边。费劲转了一转，车给推上大路了</p>
<p>We 埋怨他：</p>
<p>"You drank too much wine! So drunk you can't even walk! We've been waiting for you for a long time!"</p>
<p>"Alas! How could I drink wine today, doing such an important thing? I wanted to do this myself, risking my head! (He pointed to his own head, but when he saw the old man and the young man, he suddenly became忌讳了) It's not that I couldn't catch up, it's because the wheel脱了毂, just fixed it."</p>
<p>We are again 开始作神圣的鬥士了.</p>
<p>装做不认识酒鬼，分成两批，我们这一夥：老張 and 老林; 老王 and I.</p>
<p>We 在六尺高的沙袋旁，忍耐着气忿对××摘下帽子, 鞠一鞠躬.</p>
<p>那木笼，一共三个。××都不站在笼里。他们指指我们的膀臂, 问我们多大年岁: 我们回答了; 望望那「膏药」, 我们通过了.</p>
<p>We 一夥, 四个人, 进城了.</p>
<p>接着那酒鬼的车儿来了—嗤嗤—牙牙…</p>
<p>"检查吗?"</p>
<p>"翻得儘够了. 哈哈! 有什么好翻呢? —一袋米, 两袋米!"</p>
<p>We 笑得打哈哈.</p>
<p>我们的朋友迎接着我们, 我们兴奋极啦! 手互相紧紧握着. I told them 大坎子洋桥给烧了的事, they were so happy they shed tears.</p>
<p>他们也告诉我们一个好消息, 在今天已有十辆小车傢伙进城了.</p>
<p>而且他们握着我们底手说——</p>
<p>祝你们平安进城!"</p>
<p>是的, 我们进城了. 黑漆的地狱将会透起红亮的火光, 在明天.</p>

<h3>A Gathering of Stars on the Sea – Miscellaneous Writings on the New Year's Eve Entertainers' Gathering</h3>
<p>— Bing Du</p>
<p>It was an unprecedented event in the entertainment industry. All Shanghai filmmakers collectively participated in a singing broadcast gathering held by the Xinxin Radio Station on New Year's Eve to raise funds for refugee adoption. Perhaps you heard it on the radio, but you only heard their voices from the air. You wouldn't easily know the lively dynamics and humor of the silver stars at the radio station at that time, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>The so-called star reception area was on the second floor, with a long row of square tables arranged in the tea room. If anyone could peek through the elevator or the glass door of the restaurant, they would have a full view of the stars, because rooms and wine cellars on New Year's Eve are not easy to temporarily occupy. Attracted by a small white paper sign "Star Rest Area", "Look at the stars!" surprised many diners and travelers. Some fans took this flying opportunity to ask the waiter for a piece of white paper and asked her or them to sign it, and of course, the ones who couldn't make it in time were still women.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Huang Huaisheng, Wang Yangqiao and other staff members appeared in the rest area. Soon, Meng He arrived, followed by Lan Gen. This was definitely one of the earliest groups.</p>
<p>The earliest female stars were Xi Qiuqia and Hu Rongrong, accompanied by Xin Ling and her elderly father. At 7:45, filmmakers arrived one after another. Mei Lu, Bai Yan, Wang Lan, Zhang Wan, Wang Yin, Tan Ying... The stars were shining, and the Xinxin Tea Room became a Chang'e Palace and a Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>This time, the most eye-catching was the South China film queen Chen Yunshang. Wearing a red Western-style dress, with her palm-colored skin and healthy, petite Southern physique, she gave people the feeling of Dolores del Río. Under the introduction of Tong Yuejuan, she was very gentle and quiet, without any vanity, superficiality, or arrogance.</p>
<p>Because of her, being hired by Paramount to go to Hollywood to continue Huang Liushuang (Anna May Wong) as the only artist from the motherland active in the film city, it will inevitably have some impact on international visibility and artistic introduction. In addition to paying tribute to this rare artist, we should also strictly conduct a friendly review. However, although it was a brief meeting, due to being too busy with the New Year's Eve gathering, there was no time to talk more and understand her. However, in an ordinary social gathering, her gentle smile and humble silence were the best way to socialize in an unfamiliar gathering, leaving a good impression. I think she understands her position very well. I am not against loving beauty, but under the natural skin of Cai Jin, Wang Renmei, Yuan Meiyun, etc., it aroused a sense of vulgarity in heavy makeup. That day, I couldn't find any extravagant and vain bad habits among the stars, but I couldn't avoid occasional superficial feelings.</p>
<p>Tan Ying was mute, so she brought a record, but in the end she had to speak. Jin Lu wore a short coat and sang a majestic song with Mei Lu. Chen Yunshang is from Guangdong, but she can sing Peking opera, and her Mandarin and English are both good. At nine o'clock, the unprecedented grand occasion began in Studio 406, with social leaders and film industry tycoons. Only the calm, and 群洪警铃 remained in the tea room. All the people went upstairs.</p>
<p>The weather was so cold, but Room 406 was crowded with fifty or sixty people. The radiator seemed to be extracting everyone's sweat twice as much. Fortunately, there were two guards at the door, like iron men, blocking the surging crowd. Phones rang like a string of pearls, asking for photos, requesting conversations, requesting songs... It was a pity that the telephone wasn't equipped with a thousand units, and the stars couldn't spare themselves.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, the stars dispersed.</p>
<p>Signatures of Filmmakers</p>
<h3>Snippets from the Film World</h3>
<p>— Yin Jiao</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang Has Already Set the Marriage Alliance</p>
<p>The ancient costume film "Mulan Joins the Army" starring Chen Yunshang is scheduled to start filming today at the Huaxin Studio in Triangle Land (the original site of Lianhua Factory). The script of "Mulan Joins the Army" is from the hand of a famous playwright staying in Hong Kong, so the structure and consciousness of the story are quite sound. Zhang Shankun brought the story script back from Hong Kong last time, and the act-by-act dialogue script was brought by Chen Yunshang this time. The male lead of "Mulan Joins the Army" is determined to be Mei Xi, and it is expected to be completed in a month and a half. After that, Chen Yunshang will continue to act in another film, and then return to Hong Kong. It is said that after marrying the son of Chen Weizhou, she will go abroad to the United States. The son of Chen Weizhou and Chen Yunshang have already set 臂之盟; Chen Yunshang has a streamlined car in Hong Kong, which is a betrothal gift from Chen Weizhou's son. Chen Yunshang and Chen Weizhou's son are both surnamed Chen, and were one family 500 years ago, and will become one family again 500 years later, which is also a good story.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun's Finger with a New Diamond Ring</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun used to buy a diamond ring for 800 yuan and wear it on her finger, shining brightly, and looking very good. Recently, the diamond ring on Yuan Meiyun's finger has been replaced with a new one! It turns out that Yuan Meiyun recently received a large sum of money, which she obtained from Yihua Film Company; Yihua Company has included "The Three Incarnations Girl" directed by Fang Peilin and starring Yuan Meiyun in this year's production schedule, and is preparing to start filming in the bright spring. Fang Peilin and Yuan Meiyun are now both employees of Xinhua Company. After Yihua's young owner Yan Youxiang borrowed from Xinhua, he obtained Zhang Shankun's consent. At the same time, Yihua prepaid a sum of money to Yuan Meiyun, so Yuan Meiyun exchanged the original diamond ring and bought a new diamond ring with larger particles and more brilliance, for a price of 1,500 yuan. From this, it can also be seen how luxurious Yuan Meiyun's life has been recently.</p>
<h3>Chess Garden Announcement</h3>
<p>Recently, we have received letters from readers, saying that Chinese chess is one of the national quintessence, but the entertainment industry alone does not have it, which is regrettable! Please add this section to help readers entertain themselves. We think that chess is a very ancient thing, and all countries in the East and West respect it. According to our country, the poem "Summoning the Soul" in the "Chu Ci" already has the sentence "菎蔽象基，有六簿些". As for the current Chinese chess, it is said to have originated from Niu Sengru, the Prime Minister of the Tang Dynasty. Later, there were famous masters in each dynasty, engaging in intrigue and creating the same score to benefit future generations, which became a grand sight. However, although the records are comprehensive, there is still room for innovation. If we lay out the game every day and disclose it in the newspaper for enthusiasts to study together, it would also be an elegant thing. Therefore, we have invited Mr. Bao Zibo to take on the responsibility of editing this garden. The gentleman is well-versed in chess and has been in the chess world for many years, known as a master. It is now scheduled to publish endgame puzzles on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, opening tactics on Thursdays and Fridays, and full-board games on Saturdays. We hope that colleagues at home and abroad will provide guidance at any time, so as to collect ideas and achieve mutual benefit, which would be very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Liyuan Compilation and Information</h3>
<p>Gu Wuwei Has Shares in the Renewal Information</p>
<p>Gu Wuwei, the owner of the Hong Kong Standard Troupe, has come to Shanghai. His whereabouts are mysterious. According to reports, Gu is currently in contact with the Renewal Stage, intending to invest 10,000 yuan in shares. If it can become a reality, the Standard Troupe will come to Shanghai for performances. However, Gu himself told reporters that the troupe is currently affiliated with the Hong Kong Lee Theatre and cannot leave for the time being. If there is an opportunity to come to Shanghai, it would be a permanent solution, which is what he wishes. Negotiations were held with the Tianchan Stage a month ago, but they did not succeed.</p>
<p>Peng Youchen Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Peng Youchen, the manager of the Nanjing Central Grand Stage, arrived in Shanghai by car the night before last. Yesterday, he visited Liu Fenghai, the stage design director at the Xinji Grand Stage, for discussions. The purpose of Peng's visit is to visit his family members in Shanghai and to find talent for the Central Stage. The results of his activities will be explored and recorded later.</p>
<p>Xiao San Mazi Continues to Perform at the Tianchan Stage</p>
<p>The news that the famous actor Xiao San Mazi was negotiating with the Tianchan Stage for continued performance conditions has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to Xiao Ling, he has agreed with the front stage the night before last to continue performing until the end of the year at the agreed-upon price of 20 days of performance per month. As for what will happen next spring, it will be decided after the closing.</p>
<p>The Gong Stage's New Play Will Be Performed on the 6th</p>
<p>The 28th episode of "Hongyun Temple" which is being rehearsed at the Gong Stage, had promotional photos taken the night before last. It will be fully rehearsed tonight and tomorrow night. It was originally scheduled to be performed on the 4th, but due to the rush to produce new colorful stage scenery, there was not enough time, so it was postponed to the night show on Friday (the 6th). The actors of the troupe are studying the singing, acting, and expressions in the play with great diligence.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (6) (3)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan Visited More Than Ten Famous Teachers</p>
<p>Indeed, no matter which famous actor, they are all tempered from hardship. Lao Tan's success has been said in detail a few days ago. After Lao Tan, the leading role of the male actors is of course Yu Shuyan. Speaking of the various difficulties that Shuyan encountered when learning his art, it is enough to make some of the lucky and successful bearded actors feel ashamed. The beginning and end of Shuyan's apprenticeship with Lao Tan has been discussed in this article, but before and after he joined the Tan family, there are many famous teachers he consulted, which seem to have to be mentioned. When he performed everywhere under the stage name of Little Yu Sansheng, that was just the artistic ability of ordinary child actors. After his voice went bad, he often visited various theaters, and he met many experts. The famous Chunyang Friendship Association in the old capital was full of talent, and Shuyan was also a member. At that time, Chen Twelve (Yan Heng) and Wang Junzhi were both famous amateur actors in Tianjin and Beijing who studied Tan's art. They had good knowledge and were very particular about the pronunciation, so these two gentlemen can be regarded as lay teachers who instructed Shuyan in singing and reciting the pronunciation. In addition, there was an old celebrity, Wei Gong, who had in-depth research on Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera. He was active in the singing world for about decades, and listened to countless famous actors and excellent plays. He also gave special attention to Shuyan. This is considered his good teacher and helpful friend in asking for words and discussing drama. As for the famous teachers in the professional world, in addition to Lao Tan, Zhu Tianxiang, Qian Jinfu, etc. were the teachers who taught him the stage combat, posture, and weapons; Wang Changlin and Chen Delin were the teachers who told him about body movements, gestures, etc.; Qian, Chen, and Wang, the three elders, were not only outstanding figures in the Jing, Dan, and Chou lines, but also senior actors who had been playing with Lao Tan for a long time. Therefore, dramas such as "Dingjun Mountain", "Zhulianshan", "Wujiapo", "Visiting Mother", "Fenhe Bay", "South Tianmen", "Beating the Stick Out of the Box", and "Heavenly Thunder Report", which were co-performed by Sheng Jing, Sheng Dan, and Sheng Chou, were almost all told to him by these three old court worshipers. (Professionals call teaching drama "telling drama", such as saying that a certain drama was told to me by someone.)</p>

<h3>Discussing the Automotive Transportation Industry</h3>
<p>— Ding Zuze</p>
<p>The automotive transportation industry in America has been around for twenty years since its inception. Although its history is shorter compared to other transportation industries, its development has been rapid, surpassing others to take the lead. Currently, the total number of transport vehicles in the United States, according to reliable estimates, has reached a huge figure of 568,000. The number of employees is one million, which is even more than the number of workers in the American railway transportation industry. This illustrates the vast scale of this industry.</p>
<p>The automotive transportation industry can be divided into long-distance and short-distance. Long-distance routes can reach up to seven hundred miles. In the western United States, some routes are around one thousand miles. The operating conditions are quite satisfactory under certain circumstances. Regardless of whether the transportation company is for long-distance or short-distance, its business operations can generally be divided into two types: one is based on contracts with fixed prices and regular schedules, and the other is based on having fixed prices without fixed delivery schedules.</p>
<p>To meet the needs of modern cities, the automotive transportation industry is becoming more developed. Ships and trains arriving or departing at ports all require vehicles for transshipment. The timely distribution of food, the allocation of industrial products, the demolition and construction of buildings, and the movement of large objects all require transport vehicles. Automotive transportation has now surpassed railway transportation, with the ratio being 46% for railway freight and 54% for automotive freight. Short-distance freight transport within 250 miles is particularly thriving, increasing eight times more than long-distance freight transport.</p>
<p>In the United States, long-distance automotive transportation companies with routes of 250 miles or more are large in scale. The loading and unloading of goods follow railway methods. Despite owning a large number of vehicles, they are still able to make a profit. Some argue that large-scale companies are not suitable for operating long-distance transportation.</p>
<p>The reasons why automotive transportation is popular and so well-developed are varied. According to a survey of 35,468 merchants, the reasons can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>Reason　Percentage of Merchants</p>
<p>Fast transportation……65</p>
<p>Direct delivery to the store……65</p>
<p>Low overall freight costs……53</p>
<p>Loading at the store……51</p>
<p>More flexible and convenient……43</p>
<p>Cheaper packaging……21</p>
<p>Shorter notification time……21</p>
<p>Simpler freight rate classification……16</p>
<p>Fewer cargo losses and damages……11</p>
<p>Personal friendship and interest……3</p>
<p>From the table above, it is clear that the main reason for welcoming automotive transportation is its speed. According to statistics, the average speed of automotive transportation is 15 miles per hour, while it is 5 miles for railways, 1-3 miles for waterways, and 1-5 miles for pipeline transport (most of the kerosene and crude oil produced by American oil mines are transported to refineries in distant mining areas through large pipes). From this, it can be seen that the speed of automotive transportation is three times faster than that of railways.</p>
<p>Another advantage of automotive transportation is that the selection of endpoints is not as restricted as railways or ports. On the contrary, its endpoints are very flexible. As for the endpoints of large companies' automotive routes, there are also facilities such as driver dormitories, manager offices, and repair shops.</p>
<p>In ordinary transport vehicles, the engine is in front of the driver's seat, i.e., the driver's seat is three feet behind the front of the vehicle. Now, new transport vehicles have a high-head design, where the driver's seat is above the engine (similar to the vehicles of the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company). This has many advantages. Because the driver's seat is moved above the engine, the view is greatly improved. The driver has a wide field of vision, even in crowded downtown areas, can operate accurately. The cargo-carrying area is also increased by at least three feet compared to the old style. Secondly, the load weight is evenly distributed on the front and rear axles, resulting in more economical driving.</p>
<p>The use of trailers in automotive transportation is also gradually increasing. There are many benefits to using trailers. When the trailer is being loaded or unloaded, the truck can tow other trailers or go to the repair shop for repairs without hindering the loading and unloading of goods. The manufacturing of trailers is now very sophisticated. The mechanisms for connecting them to trucks are easy to install and remove. Even the driver does not need to get out of the vehicle to automatically detach the trailer. There is also a type of semi-trailer (the rear half of the trailer is equipped with axles, while the front half rests on the rear axle of the truck. After detaching from the truck, it can stand firmly on the ground using the support legs installed on the front half). Because it can be towed by a small truck with less horsepower, its number is also very large, especially suitable for driving on flat ground, which can greatly increase the load. The safety equipment of the new semi-trailers is particularly commendable. Even if it accidentally detaches from the truck during driving, it can automatically lower the support legs and stop automatically, preventing the danger of overturning or collision.</p>
<p>"It is not easy to obtain the operating accounts and cost accounting materials of the American automotive transportation industry, as companies do not keep detailed accounts. Some are too busy with operations and do not have enough time to keep records, while others only calculate the total annual income and expenses to conclude a certain surplus. As for the accounting of large-scale companies, although it is more detailed, it is still insufficient in terms of classification and statistics. Therefore, it is difficult to investigate which vehicles and machinery are beneficial and which are uneconomical, so as to provide a basis for future selection. Therefore, the figures listed in this article are only for reference and cannot be taken as the whole picture."</p>
<p>A large automotive transportation company operates a gasoline engine truck on a 200-mile route. It travels a total of 80,000 miles per year, carrying 20 tons per trip, at a total cost of $17,493. The cost per mile is 22.2 cents. Another similar truck operates on a 400-mile route, traveling a total of 96,000 miles per year, at a total cost of $19,657. The cost per mile is less than 22.2 cents.</p>
<p>According to a survey in California, the gasoline consumption of highway transport vehicles can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) This refers to the American gallon, which is approximately four-fifths of the British gallon or 3.75 liters.</p>
<p>The numbers listed above cannot be compared because their routes are limited to within the area and those that travel long distances.</p>
<p>There are even various statistics that attempt to prove that automotive transportation is more expensive than railway transportation at a certain mileage. However, it is generally recognized that automotive transportation is economical for mileages of 250 to 300 miles. However, the long-distance automotive transportation business of 700 to 1,000 miles is booming.</p>
<p>The taxes collected by the American government from the automotive transportation industry each year will surely exceed $1 billion. According to the US Bureau of Statistics, in 1935, there were only 61,216 transport vehicle companies and 188,809 trucks, and the tax collected was $530,860,000. The number of vehicles only accounted for one-third of the total this year.</p>
<p>In summary, although the American automotive transportation industry is burdened by heavy taxes and faces strong competition from the railway industry, its contributions are significant. Reducing unemployment, promoting transportation convenience, and indirectly promoting the progress of automotive engineering are all undeniable facts.</p>
<h3>The 25th Anniversary of Double Celebrations: China Motors and the New Dodge</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yun</p>
<p>Feixing and Dongfang Motor Companies, which started operating in Shanghai and Central China in 1914, are the predecessors of the American-owned China Motors. Therefore, the establishment of China Motors has now reached twenty-five years. The Dodge passenger cars and transport vehicles exclusively managed by the company also made their debut at the time of the company's initial establishment. Therefore, the year 1939 is also the 25th anniversary of the double celebration of the company's establishment and the sale of Dodge cars in China. What the company and Dodge factory are most proud of today, twenty-five years later, is that China Motors has achieved great success in Shanghai and Central China. At the same time, the phrase "Dodge is the most reliable" has become a well-known idiom worldwide.</p>
<p>The past twenty-five years have not only been a very important period for the automotive industry, but also the most developed period for highway construction in China. The construction of highways in China has been short, but its progress has been very rapid. In recent years, the convenience of transportation and transportation within China is far better than in the past, and most of it must be attributed to the construction of highways.</p>
<p>Highway transportation relies on automobiles as an indispensable tool. To facilitate travel and reduce transportation costs, automobiles are essential. In this regard, China Motors has made considerable contributions. In addition to providing Dodge products with excellent quality, outstanding performance, absolute reliability, and reasonable prices for all sectors to purchase, it has also established multiple branches in Central China, based on years of experience, to provide loyal service. Its contribution to enhancing and maintaining highway efficiency is significant.</p>
<p>Mr. V. J. B. Hulladn, the Acting General Manager of China Motors, told people that the 1939 New Dodge commercial vehicles and transport vehicles are a masterpiece to commemorate the silver anniversary. Therefore, whether in terms of appearance, internal equipment, operating performance, economic efficiency, or any other aspect, its reliability is even better than previous products.</p>
<p>The photo shows the office of China Motors (taken by Ye Changlie). The photo shows the exterior of the new Dodge truck factory. The factory is located in northern Detroit, USA, covering an area of 49 acres, specializing in the manufacture of half-ton to three-ton commercial vehicles.</p>
