<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本與美國蘇聯</h3>
<p>最近三日，日本各報對於美國，一致開始其咆哮：謂不辭與美國作戰，謂行將與蘇聯相歡，黔驢技窮，色厲內荏，其醜極矣。猶應分別觀者，彼政府當局尙矜持。</p>
<p>日本外交實甚淺薄，搔首弄姿，矯揉造作，輒圖以小智慧掩盡天下耳目而愚弄之，顧又在在不能自掩其寒乞相。遠者不具論，試述近事：自武力侵略中國之發動，以迄佔領武漢，迷夢方酣，恰如貧兒暴富，趾高氣揚，旁若無人，視任何他國任何事，蔑如也，此半年前之景象也。及美國宣佈廢止美日商約於前，蘇德簽訂互不侵犯協定於後，雖强自維持其岸然之姿態，然猶流落街頭，不知所歸；平沼閣倒，阿部登塲，實謀變更作風，求容國際。乃不旋踵而歐戰爆發，彼又獲別一夢境，以爲天假以緣，可資播弄；詎知軍事上則大敗於湘北，國際間有美國之警告，，於是不得不另覓蹊徑矣。蹊徑安在？德國路綫纔蹈陷阱，英法路綫緩不濟急，此二者僅可作爲外交魔術之工具；二者之外，惟蘇與美；蘇聯非好相識，而日本二十年來之國民敎育與社會敎育尤造就「蘇日之間，有不可消弭之仇恨」。故惟美國；美國者，日本鞠躬之至敬至媚者也。十月二十日，美國駐日大使格魯氏發表痛快顯明之公開警告，日人不怒不怨，譽之頌之爲「坦白」；十一月四日，格魯大使與野村外相晤談，並以公開警告作書面節略，日人謂美日樹立諒解之前途甚黯澹；爾後二三日間，美國國務卿赫爾氏，參議院外交委員長畢德門氏，相繼對日作具體行動之暗示，衆議院海軍委員長文生氏復透露擴張海軍之大計劃。凡此者，皆日本所不能當者也；十一月八日，日本各報遂作態以攻美國。如何攻美？則曰聯絡蘇聯。當局矜持，然日本非言論自由之國也。</p>
<p>右之所述，可見日本外交最近之行徑。夫豈外交？日暮途遠，挾其國命民脈以「亂衝」「亂撞」而已！善哉，美國之所以答復彼之咆哮者，無他，昨日華盛頓電訉，美國海軍部正式宣布加强太平洋方面海空軍計畫！</p>
<p>日本不恤亂衝亂撞，不將與蘇聯結合歟？蘇日結合，不將使遠東更混亂歟？吾人深信蘇聯對日本，以解決瑣散之懸案爲止，至多恢復正常之國際狀態爲止；蓋中蘇互不侵犯條約所限，蘇聯未欲締結不利於中國抵抗侵略之任何國際條約也；近徵前日蘇聯十月革命紀念節之文告與演說，尤可信也。蘇聯好作驚人之筆，與德締約，是其一例；然蘇德之約，要在對付英國，初旨不在分贓；日本而有對美作戰之勇氣，一如德國對英，則蘇日關係容得改進，一如蘇聯對德；然日本能對美作戰乎？</p>
<p>日本侵華二年有餘，精疲力竭，是經濟上不容與他國作戰。陸軍精銳，傷亡過半，空軍尤所剩無幾，是軍事上不容與他國作戰。海軍猶得保持國際第三位，然今日亦僅賴海軍保持其國際地位，謂敢孤注一擲乎？是國勢上不容與他國作戰。對華作戰之原料，端賴取給海外，尤以美國供給者爲大宗，是物資上根本不能戰，遑論對美！即使蘇聯許予接濟，接濟之可能數量幾何，能吾維持日本戰事消耗，旣屬共知其絕不可能，况就日本本身言之，爲對美而結合蘇聯，固可能乎？彼當局將如何措辭以上奏天皇，下告人民乎？是無異自撒其立國思想之大防也，是可能乎？</p>
<p>今日日本萬一之希望，其惟美國祇有目前之姿態表示，而不作具體行動。抑此類希望，亦日本數年來對美國之估量，對美國之希望也。顧以吾人觀察，美國政策堅實而穩固，向有其預定之步驟，有其公道之目標，有其貫澈之決心，復有其實踐之力量；謂將以日本各報今日之一致咆哮，或以日本當局他日之虛張聲勢，使美國忌憚而變更政策，此必無之事也。况所謂禁運軍火者，在美國絕非空前之嚴重措施。蓋兩年以來，美國以軍火及原料，繼續大量輸日，供給侵略與屠殺之用，爲破壞國際和平秩序之資，此在美國實爲「合法之罪惡，」美國朝野豈無道德觀念，豈不知之？故至明年一月，美國所謂禁運軍火，其實際形式，僅爲美日商約廢止之後，美日貿易當然歸於「白紙」而已，非有他也。不歸白紙，則中國及同情中國者得向美國朝野呼籲曰：母再援助侵略！母再援助屠殺！抑且反證以日本今日之咆哮，可見美國雖援助侵略與屠殺，他日必反噬美國者也。</p>

<h3>男子為何要想妻愛妻與厭妻？</h3>
<p>— 美國醫藥博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾　合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>那隻貓兒不吃葷？生理成熟的男子，誰不想妻？誰不愛妻？然而每每有許多男子却在厭妻，這是什麼緣故？成年而性能健康的男子，如果未婚或與妻遠別，他會像上古時候的祖先一樣，注意着新嫩的樹林裹，隨時都在熱情地懷着美麗的奇遇之幻想。這時若良緣天成，獲與健美的女郞結婚，或兩心相印，得與嬌妻團圓，他們怎能不如膠如漆。愛情深厚，在歡暢融洽的生活裏，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，創造着光明的前途，人生是何等幸福！可是一分精力，一分事業，愛情允然！男子若於早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚縱慾，或多妻斷傷，使主宰性能健康的生殖腺液消耗枯竭者，則凡神經衰躬，早洩陽萎，發育不全，未老先衰，腎虧乏嗣等症象卽不一而足。此種病夫，雖有如花美眷，在愛的生活中亦必無法美滿，或竟全然不能人道。這在男子果已由愛生厭，興趣索然！可是妻子的靑春虛度，能不感慨悲傷系之！此在時代的女性，明目張胆另結新歡，振振有詞與夫訴請離婚者亦屬多不勝計！堂堂的男子漢大丈夫，受此奇恥大辱，其內心中的悲傷爲何似！所以聰明的男子，對於性能健康，必善謀保養。保養之道，淸心寡慾果然重要，及時進補，亦屬必需。惟進補不在多而在精，允在求其對症。誠如上述症象，據世界名醫及余經騐均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴猩猩海狗等體中提取的生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法製成，有效成分得完全保存。所以品質貴重，功效確實，爲任何類似製劑所不及。服後可於一日夜間卽生精補腎，健腦活血，允貴連服不斷，則更助長發育，滋養神經，充實精力。短期內必可根治各症。秋冬常服，則延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精滑精症者，須兼服治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」（五洲中西等大藥房均售實價每匣兩元）以制止遺洩，收效允速。</p>
<p>患者鄭一平君，廣東人，二十八歲，曾犯自凟遺精，復貿然結婚，致患早洩陽萎甚劇，從未生育。且近感腦弱失眠，上月來本診所診治，經察知其病狀後，卽囑其購「生殖素」一打，「希米脫氏固精片」三匣，使其兩者連續兼服，幷施用電療注射等新法，爲時一月有半，今已百病霍然，精力豐足，夫婦間愛情彌深繾綣矣！性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<h3>遺精在初冬的療法性病專科醫師詹念會</h3>
<p>冬不藏精，春必病瘟，這是誰都知道的常識。所以遺精患者在冬季實是一個狠緊要的關頭。允以初冬天氣尚未嚴寒，在治療上要算最好的時機。因為此時能治愈其遺精，經過三冬的修養，自然精強力足。到來春的體貌發揚，紅光滿面，這是當然的結果。要是遺精息者忽略了此時機。任其因循失治，或無知靑年繼續犯着自凟縱慾，那性神經勢必日益衰弱，精關日益鬆弛，由輕症的夢遺而變爲險症的滑精漏精症者有之，由精液的枯竭爆發着腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全等症者那更多不勝計，此種靑年必然而黃肌瘦精神萎頓，初冬天氣，即已手寒脚冷，如在求學者，學業必落人後，從事於工商界職業者，亦有難能勝任之苦，欲談戀愛，因體貌不揚，每爲女性所棄，陷於失戀！卽憑媒妁之言得與女性結婚，在夫婦間性生活上更難美滿，或竟全然不能人道，這在妻子的熱情渴望之下，怎能不引爲痛心疾首？，由此而釀成疾病，陷於悲觀，或竟與夫離婚與人私通者，在今日社會新聞中亦時有所聞！靑年因遺精而致性弱體虧，成爲愛情中的罪人，社會中的罪人，果屬可悲！同時亦是男子的奇恥大辱！欲謀補救，惟有在此時期根治其遺精。治法：據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服「希米晚氏固精片」最爲對症特效。因此藥於服後當夜卽鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，收安眠止遺之特效。惟已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，而使身體益臻健康。患者如能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>健美　如何使乳峯隆然高聳？</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>高高地一對乳峯，襯着婀娜的身材，丰腴的臀部，再配上一張白晳而紅潤的臉孔，和着柳眉櫻唇，貝齒瓊鼻，這樣健美的女郞，不但在家庭里爲丈夫尊若天人。兩性間卿卿我我，愛情特別來得濃厚。卽到社會上去交際，憑她這個好模樣，也是到處似『衆星捧月』，受人熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>但是這樣的健美女性，社會上究竟還是少數，唯一的主要原因，因爲女性要達到上述的那麼健美，全仗卵巢機能的充分健全。卵巢機能健全，那麼女性的特徵，卽有良好之發育，最顯著者。就是乳部呈堅實而有彈性的聳起，卽使穿了緊窄的衣服，它也不肯就範那麼地突出胸前，雙峰對峙，空谷幽深，這是多麼引人心醉，同時臀部亦必相當發達，加以活潑的柳腰，就形成女性最神秘而可愛的全部曲線。然此數者。祗有發育良好的女性方克享受，他如早年耽溺自凟，或因月經不調，白帶不感，病後虧弱，以致卵巢機能失健，影嚮新陳代謝作用者。卽本來高聳的乳峯，亦會漸漸萎癟下去，健美喪失，容顏憔悴。此等女子，不但爲男子所厭惡，幸福毫無！卽於個人的性情方面，亦多偏狹固執，多愁善感，快樂幸福之神，與她無緣，因此她前途命運的悲慘，也就不堪設想了！欲謀補救，祗有憑藉科學，據世界婦科名醫康斯南及余等經騐。均公認服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效。因此藥於服後卽能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，倘繼續服用，担保於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，使乳峯隆然高聳，化醜陋爲嬌艷。</p>

<p>匯豐掛牌昨改縮</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長〇六二五、遠期升一二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬降三七五、美對英縮三分、對滬跌五角五分、對法小二分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開、現貨賣價、英金五辦士〇九三七五、美匯八元二八一二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃匯兌下縮之故、開後因投機家續來猛扒、加以匯豐毫無供意、而反有買胃、致市勢未隔刻許、英金卽喊軟至五辦士、後港電與有利亦來扒進、但其時出口商與日銀行界及美行扳價、稍來吐出、英金由五辦士緊至四辦士九〇六二五、美匯亦由八元一二五、軟至七元九三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英匯縮二五、美匯小五六二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉大〇·二五、此後美行大通與日行正金賣意稍濃、故市象一度回頭、計吐予港電華商與外行等現貨英金四辦士九三七五、及現貨美匯八元、但其時華商復來大舉補空、是以情况重趨緊軟、計華商補進大通有利某行等現貨英金四辦士九三七五、及本月份英金四辦士九三七五與八七五、並本月份美匯七元九三七五與八一二五、後港電有利亦結進匯豐等外行現貨英金四辦士八七五、及現貨美匯七元八七五、旋以扒者漸少、且美行與日銀行界仍續有塞出、故爲狀復見回硬、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士九六八七五、美匯八元〇六一五、比晨開英緊一二五、美軟一二八七五、</p>
<p>收盤英美尚見緊</p>
<p>後巾初因港電突來拋出、同時華商多頭亦來了結故狀况續見回硬、計賣予外行現貨英金由五辦士〇三一二五至一二五、及現貨美匯山八元一八七五至三二五、後最硬英金五辦士一二五、銀行亦肯塞出、美匯銀行買價曾呌過八元三七五、旋以有利復來力扒、一度英金又緊至五辦士及美匯八元一二五、入後華商多頭復來出籠、故重吿回硬、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士〇六二五、美匯八元一二八七五、本月份英金五辦士〇四六八七五、美匯八元一八七五、結果現期比上日英均緊〇三二五、美俱軟〇九三七五、</p>
<p>香港英匯無榮辱</p>
<p>香港九日電、今晨匯市開盤平平、英匯現期均無榮辱、美匯現貨緊一八七五、爲二十四元三七五、申匯現貨上升五元、爲二百九十元、臼匯現貨縮七五、爲一百〇三元半、十時四十五分申匯現貨續升十元、爲三百元、午收美匯現貨回鬆〇六二五、爲二十四元四三七五、申匯現貨回降二元、爲二百九十八元、行情平平、下午二時三十分開盤申匯現貨續降五元、爲二百九十三元、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>美金票會到　十二元八角半</h3>
<p>咋日外幣市况、恍惚無定、初承上日緊勢、英美金鎊需要甚殷、市面挺秀、英美金票吸納更暢、美金票升達十二元八角半、惟上漲過甚、引起獲利供給、午時回降至十二元二角、午後供給續盛、晚市爲十二元一角、香港·新加坡·荷蘭票等供給未暢，市况尚堅、安南票需要甚弱、日金票微堅、晚市爲一元三角零五厘、朝鮮票供給未盛、續趨昂貴、晚市爲一元一角二分、昨日市價、美金票降一角五分、香港票升三分、新加坡票荷蘭票俱升三角、安南票降五分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>金市狂漲暴落　最高三八五零元　港幫仍為大主顧</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、因外滙頗多曲折、致市勢變幻亦烈、大致先在漲而後回落、高低差額亦距離一百八十元之多、初開因滙市劇緊、故投機商購買心思允烈、晨開即橫跳一百三十元爲三千八百元、繼經港帮大買、再高五十元、但好景不常、外滙稍形回平、錢兌業及證券帮忽來賣出、立跌爲三千七百五十五元、不久某錢兌業等撈進尚多、且其時滙價復緊、重高達三千八百二十五元、惟將近午刻滙市又變硬、歐戰不易和平之傳說、金號多頭出籠、故回風擴大、迨至午後已盤小爲三千六百七十元、入後外滙仍緊、港帮及當日客戶紛紛了結、曾飛升九十元、而結果乃因外滙尚吿鬆硬、故收盤爲三千七百三十元、較上日午收續漲六十元、若以隔昨塲外最後價亦軋長三十元光景、當天成交仍旺、的二千兩之譜、銀樓飾金終則掛大五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤再漲六十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開承上日餘威、且聞外滙開後驟緊、故一般掮客喊買聲極振、而賣方討價殊昂、九時十分即見做開、價較上日午收竟叉橫跳一百三十元、某銀樓進金號三十兩、爲三千八百元、繼因外滙續縮、及某銀樓力代港方收買、再飛漲五十元、錢兌業五做二十兩爲三千八百五十元、時外滙忽報回硬、賣氣轉濃，錢兌　及證券帮等爭先力吐、不久即回落八十元、證券帮售予金號五十兩、爲三千七百七十元、後外滙重報緊軟、買風復起、錢兌業代客搜買、且另一證券帮吸收亦力、雖某金號多頭乘機出籠、也頭寸仍感不敷分配、致又漲起五十五元、證券藉進銀樓帮三十兩、爲三千八百二十五元、旋以外滙重又回硬、錢兌業及銀樓帮等蜂擁塞出、故遂回落、未幾即暴跌九十元、證券帮吐予金號二十兩、爲三千七百三十五元、午刻某金號稍來復進、遂拉起十元、錢兌業賣予金號二十兩、爲三千七百四十五元作午收價、午後因外滙回硬、錢兌業及某余號撳價賣出、且其時進者觀望、開市竟猛撳五十五元、錢兌業售予金號一十兩爲三千六百九十元、後證券藉與某銀樓（代港帮）乘低大吸、立回起四十元、證券帮互做十兩、爲三千七百三十元、時因外匯續報回鬆、賣風再起、銀樓幫頻來拋售、同時某證券帮及散戶多頭紛紛求售、遂父回入三千七百元關內、錢兌業吐予銀樓帮二十兩、爲三千六百七十元、旋以外滙忽又緊、加之某金號及錢兌業競相補空、且港帮與證券帮又來撈進、遂飛漲九十元、錢兌業進金號五十兩、爲三千七百六十元、入後外滙重父回硬、價乃隨之下挫、不久即回小四十五元、證券帮賣予金號三十兩、爲三千七百十五元、後錢兌業前來拉起、遂步高十五元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲三千七百三十元作晚收價、結果比上日午收續漲六十元、若較隔昨塲外亦軋大三十元光量、全天一百八十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元之譜、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金懸三八零元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十五元、迨至九時三十五分掛大十元、十二時零五分回小五元、下午二時一刻又回落五元、二時五十五分重掛高五元、結果大同行改懸三百八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　外股最俏　內債復振</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況變動甚烈、空方竭力施其高壓、以冀搖動市塲恍惚之人心、無如爲力不足、致惹起空方之抵補，抑之過甚、激起臨時反動、蓋市塲人心雖虛尚未至恐慌時期、一般人之心底觀念、多數仍係逢小做多、但在目下環境中尚非所宜、故其空頭仍多臨時性質、時局稍有轉機、反動亦必甚鉅、空方亦在隨時注意、昨日上午初開、久豐號以丙種四十五元七角小價開盤、比隔日價猛跌一元餘、壓勢雖大、而無繼續能力致空方乘隙抵補、天生大豐生大等買進甚湧、市價竟由此扶搖直上、而超過隔日收盤價、同時潤利潤亨仍在賣出、而市價並未見稍軟、午後市價因買賣均衡、進出各戶、與午前相等、故變動已甚微、午前變化雖鉅、一日結果、大都尚微漲一角至四角、祇丁種則獨小一角、成效總數約八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華成烟草公司股二十股、價爲二十丸元五角云、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市變幻多端、蓋外滙趨勢動盪不定也、晨初開盤仍甚疲弱、後漸轉佳、迨下午交易開始、因新帳登塲、市况又復堅挺活潑、一如往昔矣、但此種美景未能歷久、蓋獲利多頭、一見有機可乘又吿捲土重來、羣起了結、差幸各股稍一回落、輒有人起而維持、故結果跌風不易形成、往常成交普通之股、重爲大衆寵物、橡皮股興趣略增、成交極鉅、</p>
<p>倫敦八日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、漲風戢止、行情又吿平穩、各債均無變動、　倫敦八日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、稍吿回軟、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股回跌半鎊、價爲八十五鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股回落八便士、價爲十九先令四便士、其餘平平、</p>
<h3>紗花　白包花　交易大旺　美棉估計又減</h3>
<p>本棉交易漸　發展之象、但賣價與上日仿佛、此因近日匯票改縮一步、紗價提高二三十元、同時有一部份紗廠將紗開出數千件、原棉略爲補進、以抵頭襯、但儘係白包花銷塲、日商上海廠辦進通州火機花各千包、均係包洪水送廠價值、至於同業買賣、亦在匯票刺激心思、益覺活動、故抵解頭寸交易亦見熱鬧、觀測前途、外匯如在水平綫上、或者還有起色之望也、蘇北來源、計通花一千四百四十九包、常陰沙八百九十八包、北沙一千一百五士包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>華盛頓電、美棉農政局發表第五屆棉花生產估計量爲一千一百八十四萬五千包、比上屆之一千一百九十二萬八千包、减少八萬三千包、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來因匯兌之起伏不定、各方略較靜寂、惟廠方仍見活躍、申新廠以前日開出棉紗四千餘件、故昨日又抵進美棉千餘包、同業目前暫抱觀望、然購意始終異常濃厚也、日商廠日來對於外棉購辦較爲靜寂、諒以日廠之需額已足之故也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初殊爲活躍、海外棉商在市購買頗爲猛烈、同時政府對於今後新花貸款法案、亦已公佈、因之引起各方之買風、及空頭抵補、收盤價格較之前日行情市漲起十餘磅音、印度連同預測回落三四雜比、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦跌四便士餘、</p>
<h3>投機商趁勢拉提　紗市漲風重起　雙馬天女各跳廿元許</h3>
<p>紗市續昇、且漲風允熾、泰半係投機商熱烈推動、大衆都喊滙票掛縮、對於物價看漲、舊事重提、但實際消化依然微乎其微、故除雙馬一牌爲投機目標、拉提以外、其他紗市尚在硬中帶軟、所以根本問題、須待實銷來扶植基礎、則當可鞏固也、不過目前均將滙票起伏來作工具矣、銷路雖狹隘、反與市面不生問題、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日餘風、且同業復來活動、多說滙票要看縮、呌買者增多、二十支雙馬開價爲六百五十元、漲十元、但廣帮採辦不旺、一般經營者將外滙作工具、搜羅心意又見熱烈、市價步步上升、至六百六十元、查半日間成交統計僅九百二十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、天女漲十七元半、雙地球漲十九元、廠方由鴻章廠開出十支寳彝七十包、價爲五百零五元、昨有穴百二十四件　　港，茲將各帮。買去之額量列左、</p>
<h3>糧食　把持客尖　不使低落　蕪秈可買搬運瞪　粳米市面見定局</h3>
<p>昨日大雨、杜米僅由車輪運到蘇嘉崑太楓嘉青泗等貨二三千包、所以平疲市况叉見帶緊、若客尖自前一度回平後、昨則一般貨主、以手中有在高峯時拉進之貨、爲數頗多、遂更不肯輕脫、致市貨出樣愈鮮、同時作客方面當斯平勢、又抱乘廉進取之旨、相互問津、着意搜求江北尖、些許市貨、霎時復行吿罄、大都作客在茲向隅之際、轉求京蕪尖、而市貨亦屬有限、故即一售而空、而當此環境、市面但見節節上升、收盤行情、江北尖爲二十三元半、决之二十三元、京蕪尖二十三元七角、决至二十二元半、餘如新粳及茶窑種、晨間雖曾一度活躍、本鄉店胃亦頗採納、後經客販趁高湧出、頓見市貨充斥、一時形勢回軟、銷場轉呆、結果市面僅呈定局、悉無榮辱、蘆羊尖到貨旣較有限、而市存亦弱、更兼頗合店胃、脚地堅固異常、所以一經活動、市面即漲、昨市成交殊旺、行情提高四五角不一、變元形勢仍緊、亦稍挺秀耳、</p>
<p>客秈昨晨開市後、因前日市價回平後又引起客幫之添辦、店舖雜戶需胃允食、而各地來源依然寥落、日商仍乏整批售出、行販客囤趁機報俏、客秈高擋乃昂至二十三元八角、比之前市陡升半元、惟午後有販戶兜售定期交貨之皖秈、人心始見回平、惟江北帮已因通划試運、蕪秈亦有不日湧到之傳、而目下秈價巳與粳價漸决接近、故業中預測後市或有轉定之期望云、</p>
<p>按江北秈高貨合申二十元〇五角、大市貨合二十元左右、滬地行販因前辦虧本、尚不敢搬運、而江北當地行販則已有數十百包之小批多已運出、早運者本可抵滬、乃被崇通一帶缺米所攔售、</p>
<p>蕪秈向由日商三井洋行專利、近因日商小洋行請求興亞院開放、故於十一月一日起、各小洋行已有搬運證數批領出、小洋行因自身力弱多與華商合作、或以每包二元至三元半之照費售與行販、故不久蕪米或有湧到之可能、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤降低一角　麥市擯持乏成交</h3>
<p>麵粉廠盤麵昨降跌一角、二號粉正牌改為七元三角現鈔、而銷塲仍屬平常、蓋緣目下長江一帶、均被內地粉充塞、即滬市亦絡繹運到？市面頗受影響、聞砲車粉客盤仍須四角、而南北客銷均屬零星、本街去化亦祇日常需用而已、回籠貨市面迭見暗鬆、但乏正市、統市成交不過三萬包、</p>
<p>麥來源的有四五千包、到貨均預備上棧、不願出樣、良以粉價趨下、原料當然有連帶影響、而貨方以成本高昂、擯持不售、結果廠客均無正式妥交、</p>
<h3>油市　生油暴漲</h3>
<p>昨日花生油市况、突呈緊張局面、蓋外匯暗市猛縮、港帮辦胃力勁、貨戶趁機在抬、致行市暴漲三元外、共計成交膠州油二百件、價爲五十七元、天津桶油一百桶、價爲七十三元、烟台聽油一千聽、價爲七十三元、江北聽油四百聽、價爲七十四元、豆油潛勢軟弱、雖神戶大連桶油被把持不開、但簍裝油售價鬆動、比上日市稍修二角、計開膠州油二百件、價爲四十八元四角、及烟台聽裝油一百聽、價爲六十六元五角云、</p>
<p>昨糖市鑲天祥洋行消息，荷租白價爲荷盾七·一八，又漲〇·〇八、而荷匯又縮三七五、故公會劃盤續見上展、現貨二四粗白　元許、外棧貨爲五十三元八角，至五十三元三角、太古車白漲允半、西棧B　爲五十七元、東棧五十七元、以决照退、取赤荷赤路有呌升、未有成交、本一號綿白五十三元五角、二號五十三元、三號五十二元五角、四號五十二元、國糖趨勢依然平軟、僅有呌價、未有成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　碼圓肉高昂逾恒</h3>
<p>石碼生晒圓因到貨奇缺、產價且升、故市勢突緊、查日前僅到二箱、聞已開出、比之首盤竟漲近十兀、苟與夏初低價比較、項漲三分之二强、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉市買賣不盛</h3>
<p>昨匯市益堅、紗綫一致回漲、布價亦跌後轉堅、喊盤略增、祇以實銷去化呆滯、市上存底過厚、故市氣仍鬆、頗有乘機脫售、而購戶多數抱觀望態度、市塲上賣買空氣不濃、白貨粗布及印花色丁銷路不惡、浙路溫甬帮辦粗布近二百包、細斜·細布·色斜五六十件、閩粵帮辦粗布·細布·色布·色斜。嗶嘰一百餘件、本街辦細布·細斜·粗布·印染漂白布疋一百數十件、國外孟買等地添辦印花色丁等貨五千數百疋、香港帮辦細斜·色丁·坯布·細布一百餘件、</p>
<p>東疋白貨細布·細斜晨市漲風頗勁、十二磅龍頭細布高盤每疋十八元七角半、嗣以實銷平後、行盤肯鬆、東棉開出龍頭細布現貨僅十八元五角、藍雙魚細斜十七元一角、故午後市氣轉挫、細布喊盤跌至十八元六角、四君子嗶嘰晨盤到過每碼六角二分二厘半、旋復下降至六角零七厘半至一分、全日細布·細斜本街同業買賣的五百件、</p>

<h3>重慶充滿樂觀氣象　中國決長期抗戰　戰時首都表現活躍姿態　人民必勝信念異常堅強　合衆社遠東總經理遊渝感想</h3>
<p>美國合衆通信社遠東總經理馬理斯氏、漫遊中國戰時首都、甫於昨日返滬、據稱、「基於中國政治機構之堅强、綽能支持長期戰爭、以及不斷訓練無數軍隊、源源開往前綫增援、迭著豐功偉業、故重慶方面、充滿樂觀氣象、此種信念、無論於全城仟何地點、皆有明顯之表現、上自官吏之文吿、下迄無數從事建設工作之勞工、必勝必成之心、皆自然流露於言表、</p>
<p>中國絕無衰弱表徵</p>
<p>以此之故、前有誤解外長王寵惠博士對余發表之談話、指爲中國政府有若干衰弱之現象者、甚使余訝異、王博士答余所詢、曾談及調停及和平、使人設想戰事或將終了、惟解釋此項答詞爲中國衰弱之表微、則爲絕大之錯誤、其與眞實之距離、猶如重慶與東京、或尚不止此也」、馬理斯在重慶、除作著名之王外長訪問外、又曾謁見行政院長孔祥熙。國防最高會議秘書長張羣。戰地黨政委員會秘書長邵力子·第五戰區司令長官李宗仁將軍·父與中宣部長葉楚傖·副部長董顯光·中央通訊社社長蕭同茲·作長談</p>
<p>日美衝突殆不能免</p>
<p>馬氏繼稱、『余所謁見之諸領袖、對於國際局勢之傾向、頗表滿意、允於美國最近對日本所採取之强硬態度、極存忻慰、彼等指出、日本野心之行動、有許多點皆不能避免與美國發生衝突、此外、以余個人之觀察、已證明川省物華天產、絕非虛語、此係天府之國、使任何人能賴地利以舒適生活也、</p>
<p>重運輸制度逐漸改進</p>
<p>中國內地之交通事業、不斷在改良與恒定進展之中、惟昆明至重慶之運輸費、依然高昂、故任何外貨、在重慶均視爲奢侈之消費、雖然、據美國運輸顧問專家之預期、則俟新運輸制度建立後、客貨水脚、立將下降、而此新巡輸制度、正在邁步前進中也、</p>
<p>重慶建設突飛孟晋</p>
<p>伐木錚錚、重慶市之建設、有　人之進展、此項建設、正同土地之兩面推進、蓋地面上之建築旣範圍甚廣、而地面下之防空壕、亦開掘良多、轟然之聲、不時隱隱從速處傳來、有若大砲怒吼、實爲爆炸岩窟之聲、蓋藉作補充防空壕之用、而飛屑碎礫、則檢集作爲舖建馬路之川、</p>
<p>防空壕內安全疏適</p>
<p>現在重慶防空壕、已足敷應用、故空襲警報一作、人民即鎭靜安步入壕暫避、或者腋挾書本、手提帆布小椅、在防空壕內、就石油燈或手炬之光、不廢諷誦、或者黨握瓜子、在壕中嗑食、並與其親友閒談、在此决劇烈之戰爭中、有突飛猛進之成績者、允當稱道航空事業、爲余所從未多見者、中國航空公司之六小時的渝港航班、現幾每日飛航、安適可靠、兼而有之云、</p>

<p>僞「維新政府」爲推行其「華興券、」由「江海關監督」李建南、向各國在滬領事及江海關羅稅務司、要求禁止中國法幣進口、今各國領事及羅稅務司雖未接受、但上海外匯黃金等暗市、因投機者又思蠢動、市塲發生激烈波動、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>將蹈收受偽幣覆轍</p>
<p>江海關稅務司羅福德、對「監督」李建南之要求、雖未予接受、始終米下禁止法幣進口任何命令、但因上海環境關係、恐將蹈以前收受「華興券」之覆轍、因今年九月一日江海關之收受「華興券、」羅稅務司亦未頒佈任何命令、故今後之中中交農四行運滬法幣、勢將發生阻撓、惟自國軍西撒後、中中交農四行即行停止裝運法幣</p>
<p>外商銀行運幣接濟</p>
<p>上海各友邦銀行爲維持上海市面供給正當需耍、與中中交農四行總行接洽、由各友邦銀行裝運法幣來滬接濟、例如此决抵滬之美國總統輪船公司之批亞士號、裝來中國法幣一千萬元、即係美商大通銀行所有、「江海關監督」雖企圖阻撓、終因外商關係、仍得安全卸下、今各友邦銀行對該監督之要求、決置之不理、並堅決反對之、</p>
<p>影響各國對華貿易</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、上海租界區域內之法幣流通爲數頗鉅、足敷需要、所以如果强迫阻止法幣來滬、亦於市民生計、不感影響、至於外商銀行運滬之中國法幣、完全爲國際貿易關係、倘「僞監督」一意孤行、勢將引起各國對華貿易重大損失、各國勢必提出嚴重交涉、據外商銀行方面消息、所運之法幣爲彼所有該、「監督、絕無干涉餘地、</p>
<p>投機作崇掀動市場</p>
<p>上海外匯黃金等暗市、因政府一時權力所不及、全爲投機商人作崇牟利、最近因中國對外貿易好轉、香港·新加坡·等處資金、回歸上海、於是外匯黑市步鬆、黃金暗市慘落、而投機者不敢冉行操縱致整個金融漸入正軌、自「江海關監督」李建南、企圖阻止法幣來滬後、」般投機者又思蠢動、故意散放謠　、但預料終將慘敗、</p>
<p>黃金外匯證券暗市</p>
<p>昨日上海金融市塲（一）外匯黑市、英商匯豐銀行掛牌、英滙縮一五爲四辦士七五、美匯縮五六二五爲七元六八七五、（二）黃金暗市上午收盤爲三千七百四十元、下午收盤三千七百三十元、（三）證券統一甲、上午收盤五十六元四角五分、下午收盤五十六元三角、乙上午收盤四十八元二角五分、下午收盤四十八元四角、丙上午收盤叫十六元八角、下午收盤四上六元八角、丁上午收盤四十六元叫角五分、下午收盤四十六兀四角、戊上午收盤四十七元四角五分、下午收盤四十七元四角、</p>
<h3>楊進海羅志斌　昨同遭槍殺　兩人均在日方工作　酒樓宴客中彈畢命</h3>
<p>昨日下午七時二十分、福州路五一四號萬利酒家、疋在賓客雲集、酒綠燈紅之際、突然在二樓二十二·二十三·兩號宴客席上、發生槍殺案、當塲中槍斃命者、計有服務日方憲兵部担任特務之楊進海·羅志斌·兩人、茲將各　分誌如决</p>
<p>壯漢入室趨前開槍</p>
<p>四五日前、有名楊進海者、向該酒家預定二十元之筵席計五桌、昨日下午七時許被邀之客、魚貫而來、達四五十人、正在入席、冷盆甫經端上、尚未舉杯時、忽有五六衣黒袍之壯渶、前往該酒樓當留一三於該酒家門口望風、尚有三人、則直衝登樓、入楊進海預定之宴客房間二十二·二十三兩號、舉目叫矚見楊羅兩人就座於該房間西北首之一席、並肩而坐、三壯漢見目的人後、即飛步至該席前、向彼等開放數槍、闔座諸人、於興高采烈之際、突聞槍聲、驚恐莫名、紛紛奪席圖逃、</p>
<p>楊羅二人當場擊斃</p>
<p>其時該酒家茶役帳房　亦已聞得槍聲、均避至福州路上、其他在該酒家宴客者、亦匆匆由二樓奔下、三壯漢於此萬分緊張狀態中、復連續發槍十餘響、計楊進海被擊中頭部三槍、羅志斌擊中腰部四槍、均當塲斃命、其餘同席數人、均未遭波及、兇手諸人見目的已達、即從容下樓、於人叢中出門朝東向湖北路南北兩端逸去無蹤</p>
<p>捕房得訊派探察勘</p>

<h3>京滬滬杭兩路　沿綫戰雲密佈　常州蘇州杭州形勢均緊張　南黃浦日軍依日艦為護符</h3>
<p>邇來華方正規軍及游擊部隊對京滬滬杭兩路沿綫及江南各城鎭日軍、進攻至爲激烈、昨據丹陽來人談及該地最近情形如次、</p>
<p>奔牛附近毀車四輛</p>
<p>本月一日晚力時許、在奔牛與新間（武進轄境）兩點間之連江橋地方、有由京開來之軍用車一列、觸發地雷、轟然一聲、濃烟四起、當炸燬機車一輛及貨車三輛、損失極爲重大、惟死傷人數則不詳、據聞該項地雷、係江南某流動部隊所埋置、出事以後、致京滬路常州丹陽間交通中斷、直至三日始修復通車、</p>
<p>京滬旅客咸具戒心</p>
<p>據來客云、彼在無錫以西、石塘　附近、及蘇州以東唯亭附近、曾目覩上决被炸毀之車輛數節、尚倒路旁、車身均全毀、僅剩車盤、歪臥於秋草叢中、因京滬路常發生炸車事件、旅客搭車、咸具戒心、均不敢乘京滬兩地開出之早班車、以防不測、</p>
<p>常州華軍正圖反攻</p>
<p>又據常州來人談、武進西南鄉戰事、雖吿一段落、然聞華軍　十　師正圖聯合其他正規軍及地方部隊大舉反攻、以致日軍留駐於涅里·夏溪。成章等鎭之部隊、不敢撤調、城中居民、每日在恐慌中生活、市面凋零、已有一部份人避靴來滬、而日軍對京滬旅客之檢查、亦更形嚴厲、蘇州城門、十餘日內、時聞時閉、已有數十决、</p>
<p>杭州城廂情況緊張</p>
<p>杭州城廂形勢、自華軍田部在滬杭沿綫實行動員後、城中情况、確極緊張、據鐵路方而消息、杭垣客商所積貨件、日來已開始撤退、前日一日問貨車來滬有四列車之多、滿儎運到、日商貨件亦不少、</p>
<p>浦南華軍聯絡成功</p>
<p>上海縣屬塘灣鄉鎭、均爲江蘇省保安第二團克復、華方並在某地組織戰時縣政府、指揮軍隊、已將靑浦泗涇七寳循滬西漕河涇而至松江天馬山、及上松公路長橋匯橋跨千步涇新橋莘莊顓橋錢糧廟之各部隊、聯絡成功、北橋日軍、受兩面夾圍、日間僅守滬閔公路交通綫、至晚則收集於閔行及北橋之司令部中、故下午六時起、滬閔公路憧憧往來、皆遊擊隊士、其公路兩側之步哨、可守望相見、終宵槍聲不絕、日軍不敢顧問、黃浦南岸遊擊部隊、前哨抵浦邊警戒日軍在無法之中、爲保護其兩岸日軍起見、南黃浦竟有兵艦六艘之多、計封鎖綫一艘、龍華水泥廠一艘、塘口一艘、閘港一艘、關港十艘、閔行一艘、入晚探照燈四射、以示恐嚇、</p>
<h3>各校追悼馬相伯　服喪一天　外界參加　不加限制</h3>
<p>上海各界發起爲百歲老人馬相伯氏舉行之追悼會、業於前日在銀行供樂部推定籌備委員、將籌委會組織成立、該會定十三日舉行首决會議、討論一切籌備事宜、本埠復旦震旦兩大學、亦已定於本月十五日分別舉行追悼儀式、震且大學校董會已於昨日通吿全校師生、届時一律赴呂班路天主敎堂參加、革於外界方面、該校決不加限制、甚望各團體及天主敎友踴躍參加、共襄盛舉、聞此項追思彌撒典禮、將山主敎一人神父兩人主持、主敎擬請馬氏外甥朱志堯之弟現任海門區主敎朱仙梅担任、神父一爲震旦大學校董才爾孟、其餘一人、尚未決定、如朱主教不克來滬、則由神父才爾孟主持典禮、復旦大學之追悼會、已由復旦同學會着手籌備一切、該校大學部及實中附中兩校前後同學、不下數千人、此時雖散居各地、但留滬者尚不在少數、届時將由校長李登輝氏親臨主持、是日該校除停課一日外、全校師生一律纏黑布服喪一天、以示哀悼、</p>
<h3>美海軍陸戰隊　展期大操　因跑馬廳積水甚深</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國駐滬第四海軍陸戰隊、原定明日（十日）在跑馬廳舉行第一六四年創立紀念日操演、茲因跑馬廳積水、數日內未必乾燥、故此項操演與招待會、已無定期展緩、</p>
<h3>中國抗日　實為美國而戰　美應以全力援助中國　如再容忍必後悔莫及　美經濟學家巴勃遜坦白之言論</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國著名經濟學家巴勃遜、近自東方返美、發表意見稱、中國在其抗日戰事中、實亦爲美國而戰、故應獲美國之援助、中日戰爭、今使日本人民精疲力盡、而或已深悔挑動此戰事矣、一般人均信中國人民之生殖率、將可逐日軍出中國、同時、苟非美國更予協助、則中國之地位、未免不利、日本人民固勤勞而當友誼者、但日本軍人祗可與史丹林及希特勒作最惡行動時相比擬、日木進侵中國、將爲歷史上最殘暴與無理可喻之舉、日本軍事領袖不受的束、其所以攻擊中國者、僅因中國終已圖自强而已、彼等深恐中國獲得機械而生產時、則將使日本商業、一落千丈、乃公然承認此爲異日永小再遇之機緣、</p>
<p>日軍殘酷直類野人</p>
<p>余（巴氏自稱、下同一在中國所目擊之破壞、殊爲驚駭、此外、余曾親與可靠領事·商人·與市來自內地之敎士談話、彼等均以爲在華數逾百萬名之日兵、其行動直類一羣殘忍而失望之野人、屠殺·奸淫·拷打。與破壞、猶不足盡述其罪惡、</p>
<p>中國資產移入內地</p>
<p>平時愛好和平之中國人民、乃大受激厲、奮起反抗、藉最巧妙策略與游擊戰以自衛、兩軍頗少陣地戰、但分成小隊、隨時隨地交鋒、整個一事件」中最有希望之徵象、爲四千萬人民携機械·工具。與牲畜、自中國東部人烟稠密之城市、移往富庶而未經開發之西部諸省、大小工廠數百所、已跋涉千里、移入內地、鐵路軌　亦拆散、由苦力漸向內運、而新合作工業數千處、今在西部新區域內開辦中、</p>
<p>日軍僅控制交通綫</p>
<p>日本現已佔有中國口岸頗多、惟物品私運出入、仍在大舉進行中、日軍控制平漢與粵漢兩路以東至沿海之多數區域、但該區中仍有數百萬人民、從未見一日兵、該兩路以西、則有三萬萬人民繼續工作如常、</p>
<p>中國力能逐出日軍</p>
<p>中國政府巳遷重慶、固若金湯、雖每隔一二週即遭轟炸、但損壞甚微、任何人預　中日戰爭將持續多少、實屬蠢愚、一般人均信、唯中國人民之生殖率一端、終將逐日軍出中國、就余在日本所見者、戰爭今使日人精疲力竭、或已深悔挑動此戰事矣、</p>
<p>美國應予經濟援助</p>
<p>但就他方面言、美國須對中政府作更大的經濟上援助、或至少遮斷供給日軍之物料、吾則未免不利於中國、就事實而論、中國刻正爲吿人允其爲夏威夷人民而戰、余意美政府目下援助日軍之態度、似屬自殺、夏威夷人民應竭其全力、至少援助中國、直至目前之歐戰終止、而英法能在東方取自由手腕、</p>
<p>美國任務厥為五端</p>
<p>果爾美國須完成下列五事、（一）日本以爲該國命定統治全亞洲、連同夏威夷在內之盲目的宗敎信仰、加以遏止、（二）阻止蘇聯在華伸張共產主義、以為援助中國抗日自衛之代價、（三）從事人道主義之服務、拯救二千五百萬無辜男婦孩童、免遭屠殺與痛苦、（四）挽救可貴的美國在華貿易與航運、此乃美國解決失業問題所切需者、（五）保護吾人費時百年以樹立的價值五萬萬兀之敎會財產、簡言之、吾人今乃誤加容忍、如繼續容忍、則他日吾人將自食其果、</p>

<h3>米價物價相繼下降後　生活費初見減低　邏輯思維月猛升之後略形下降　平民心理上已稍學鬆動</h3>
<p>自去歲十二月以還、十閱月中、本市工人生活費指數連續上升、迨入十月、始見减低、十月指數爲二四八·二二、·較九月份之二八三·二三、計降百分之一二·三六、貨幣購買力亦隨之而升、民國二十五年度法幣一元、十月份計值四角零二厘九毫、分類指數、燃料類較上月减百分之二一·七八、食物類减八·九八、衣着雜項則見上漲、計衣着增百分之一〇·二〇、雜項增百分之五·六一〇、此種指數、以較八月、猶形高漲、然於纍月猛升之後、初見下降、平民生活艱難、怵目驚心之餘、所得心理上之慰藉、當非淺鮮、食米蔬菜煤球等項、日常生活之需、本月價格均趨下落、對於平民生計、裨益允多、</p>
<p>下降主因</p>
<p>本月物價降落主因、的有數端、歐戰旣起、百物隨之騰貴、然而月來演變所趨、進口市塲所受影響、初不若預期之烈，此其一、本月以還、外匯行情、頗見鬆動、法幣價值、愈見穩固、此其二、投機囤積之輩、鑒於形勢不利、亟求脫手、此其三、米價下落、各種物價、隨之降低、此其四、</p>
<p>米煤跌價</p>
<p>米價之降、由於秋收豐稔、新貨登塲、來源亦較疏通、計二號粳米較上月跌百分之八·五八、羊秈跌一六·九八、糯米跌三·三二、蔬菜項下、靑菜蘿蔔菠菜跌百分之二十至三十不等、鮮鹹猪肉則各跌百分之一六·五三及三四·〇三、煤球價格低落、一由於煤斤來源未斷、二由於大廠抑價競售、以壓迫小廠、三由於用戶囤積尚充、需要不旺、</p>
<p>衣料獨漲</p>
<p>衣着類各品、均見昂貴、土布較上月漲百分之二四·五八、絨布漲一九·七五、漂布漲一六·五九、所增最烈、天時漸寒、冬貨上市、加以棉紗染料、均見昂漲、衣着指數、遂趨上遊、雜項各品、亦見上升、肥皂香烟黃酒高粱等較上月各漲百分之五至百分之十云、</p>
<p>人心看跌</p>
<p>據觀察家稱、時至今日。歐洲戰事膠着、並已弛禁、准原料外運、故滬市物價不致再漲、年內或將繼續回跌、况各地海口遭受封鎖、客銷停頓、加以滬市購買力軟弱、市塲營業疲莫能興、叉年關瞬屆、各業爲顧全週轉、人心轉趨下游、故　市物價回跌、勢所必然、二十八年十月份上海市工人生活費指數表</p>

<h3>撲滅花會運動</h3>
<p>— 福鏞</p>
<p>自從上海變成孤島以後，死灰復燃的「花會」開始活躍了起來。到目前，這種毒害無智識階段羣的「聽筒」機關，實在難以統計其有多少；不僅是特殊區域的歹土內公開地在活動着，並且已經迅速，秘密地蔓延到人口稠密的租界上］沒有幾天以前，警務處還在貝勒路破獲了一個「聽筒」，就是一偭例子。</p>
<p>這當然是一個嚴重的治安，社會問題。十海雖是文化水準較高的大都市，但無智識的文盲愚民依然佔着人口的極大比例，他（她）們這一羣都是自食其力的貧寒者，爲了智識的淺薄，容易盲從；爲了物質的引誘，容易入迷，於是一决二次地終然跌落進「打花會」的毒網，眞是所謂愈打愈窮，愈窮愈狠，愈狠愈精光。</p>
<p>撲滅這種有勢力的機關不是一件易事，况且在歹士內他們又有着特殊的保護，愚民們的病態已深也是間題，記得我們幾個小夥子會經滿腹熱誠地在麥特赫司脫路一條小弄內勸說，但是所得到的結果還是空空，許多婦女是這樣的回答我們。。</p>
<p>「家也輸去半個了，我還肯不打？」</p>
<p>我們把「花會」的毒害解釋給她們聽，並且誠懇地吿訴她們，打下去還要輸，不如回頭，做一點其他的工作，她們反懷疑地問：</p>
<p>「你們是甚麼人？……」</p>
<p>再說下去恐怕這些愚孀要嗔怒我們「觸霉頭」了，於是我們的希望成泡影—失敗！</p>
<p>目覩着一個個憂傷着臉，我實在難過得很，我替他（她）們的墜落可惜。</p>
<p>下面幾條是我個人所想到的撲滅「花會」的方法，還請賢明者指敎，我在這裏代他（她）們求救！</p>
<p>（一）警務上的加緊工作，爲撲滅聽筒」的運動。</p>
<p>（二）從沉溺中蘇醒的少數人民坦白地把自己所知道的「聽筒」，「航船」報吿給捕房，讓捕房以迅速的手段按址去破獲。</p>
<p>（三）因爲根本上撲滅那些機關是一件不容易的事，所以亦應該由勸說愚民做起，這一層必須有組織的，有系統的去做，吾則徒費心機。</p>
<p>（四）最低限度每一個智識份子檢察一下自己的家庭及有關係的四週，有沒有這種惡習的愚民；有的話，好好地去規勸，陳以利害，曉以大義。</p>
<p>希望大家來救救那些夢想發財的平民！大家來救救那些異想天開的蠢虫！他們可憐吓！</p>
<h3>銀錢界舉行　兒童健康智力競賽</h3>
<p>— 敏文</p>
<p>銀錢業從業員是一種被人最羨慕的職業，他們工作在高樓大厦里面，辦着有固定時間的事情，到四五點鐘，就可離開辦公室，回家休息。收益方面，也是相當優裕，怎不令人垂涎三尺呢？</p>
<p>不幸銀錢界裹有絕大多數是小職員們，他們生活的狀况，竟會使你大失所望。月入二三十元薪水是多得很，在上海物價一再高漲的今天，維持一家溫飽，已經成了問題，所謂中國未來主人翁的兒童們，他們的敎育和健康情形，一定是社會所關心的。</p>
<p>最近由銀錢業聯誼會舉辦會員兒童健康比賽，和曾力競賽，即將在總理誕辰紀念日同時舉行。銀聯會，我們知道它是銀錢界中唯一的業餘團體，擁有經理職員練習生七千餘人之多，所以這一决能注意會員兒童問題，在生活痛苦萬分的上海，實際上恐怕已被人們所遺忘的事了。</p>
<p>他們的健康比賽辦法是這樣的：凡銀錢業同人的子弟或親屬，都可以免費參加。比賽項目有（一）身長體重（二）血色（三）皮膚（四）骨格肌肉（五）眼（六）耳鼻喉（七）牙（八）腹（九）生殖器（十）預防。同時他們對於下列四項，允爲注意：（一）一般情形（快樂活潑玲瓏壯健）（二）動作（坐立行的姿勢及標準動作）（三）言語（四）淸潔情形。</p>
<p>比賽的等級，是根據年齡大小，分成甲乙丙三組，評判的工作，是委托上海保健會王世偉醫師担任，以醫學上的觀察來評判成續是最切當的一回事。</p>
<p>參加智力競賽的資格，也同健康比賽一樣，不過等級的分組，是改爲學校年級來分配了。規定一年級至四年級，共分四組；競賽的項目，分爲口試與筆試。一切題目，由立本小學程維靈先生代擬，以最公開和合理的處理這决兒童工作，用高貴的贈品獎勵成績最優秀的兒童，使他們更加努力。</p>
<p>最後要指出的，耶穌聖誔節一個月後就要降臨了，一年一度由各團體出力，使得一羣流浪在街頭的羔羊，得到一些玩具糖果和快樂的一天，今年更希望銀錢界同人，別坐視無家可歸的無數兒童，讓出一些賜惠給他們吧？（却酬）</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回習外勸報人新領域服內務學舍小排場</p>
<p>郡慧華扣算了日子，回來時，又到杭州去了一趟。然後從嘉興到蘇州，的了吳君素，一同到上海，去吃金澹雲的喜潛。她的機器脚踏車，有時隨身帶了走，有時寄在朋友人家，沒有一定。難道這些車子上不要照會的嗎？實在那時車子上的照會，却分兩種。一種是僅能在本市用的，一種却是可以供全國用的。原來現在中國的車捐處，對於車捐，都是如此。僅僅供本市用的照會，收費極廉，但是那車子，不能開出本市以外。另有一種照會，可供全國用的，只要有了那照會，全國到處司行。大概那種全國通行的照會，和那僅僅本市可用的照會，它的車捐，相差是十與的比例。無論是各種的汽車，各種的獸車，機器脚踏車，人力車，以及種種色色的車，都是如此。中國的交通部，就有一個全國車捐處，而各省各縣，也都有全國車捐分處。只要看到那張照會上，第一個是什麼字，便可以知道這車子是那裹的，從那一省那一縣所捐的照會了。如今邵慧華的這輛機器脚踏車，是在美國定製的一輛女用機器脚踏車。除了本人之外，摺疊式的有一個皮兜，裝在傍邊，可以另坐一人。倘然不需要時，便把它摺攏了，一些也看不出。其餘各種修理的器具，一應俱全。邵慧華定購這輛機器脚踏車時，花了一千五百元美金，大家都說很爲便宜。她有了道輛機器脚踏車後，什麼地方可以去得。本來中國現在的公路，到處已是四通八達。不過在中日戰爭的時候，爲了軍事上的關係，有許多築得很好的公路，硬生生的把它破壞了，掘毀了。因爲這些公路，資敵利用，是不值得的。但路基依然仍在，橋樑有的也炸斷了，也要重修起來，可是有了基礎，當然容易得多。不知戰後的公路　比了戰前又多了不少。而且中國的公路，也小止是在戰後添設的，即在戰爭的時候，也添了不少。譬如像西南的許多公路，和西北的許多公路，大都是在戰爭時代建　的。所以由於中國公路的發達，無論是一輛汽車，或是像邵慧華的一輛脚蹈車，可以周游全國。無論是遠至新疆，西藏，內外蒙古，都可以去得。（二〇一）</p>
<h3>汽車間裏的房客</h3>
<p>— 樹</p>
<p>編者先生：在西區一帶，有許多洋房背後的汽車間都出租了，我就是其中的一個汽車間房客。當我避難到上海的時候，正是上海人口最繁密的時候，能租到這樣一間汽車間存身，也覺得很倖運的了。不過我也奇怪，他們把汽車間出租以後，把汽車停放到什麼地方呢？如果這面收來的房租去付給另外停放汽車的租費，上海的土地如此寳貴的今日，想來不致有多大的盈餘的，而且坐汽車是爲了舒適，現在不是更麻煩嗎？住了幾個月，才知道我的房東已離開上海，那輛汽車或許也出售了。是他們的賬房，把小洋房分租之後，連汽車間也打入每月進款項下了。其實，我早說過，能得暫避風雨之所，都是一樣的，而且我們鄉下的房屋，有的還不及汽車間講究呢！可是上决颶風到滬的時候，却發生了問題。原來那汽車閒是用木板建迭的，外面塗上泥土石灰，經了二天大雨冲洗，泥土石灰剝落了，雨水如遊蜒似的沿木板流下來，又因地勢較低，下面積水盈寸，假使颶風不即離滬，這汽車間或是恰恰做了風兩的犧牲品了。自然，我是和房東交涉過，那位賬房也答應重加修葺。可是事過境遷，他推說向大房果去交涉了。昨天，又是大雨竟日，我的住所又是上漏下積，做了水上之家。因爲鑒於上决交涉的無效，我決定搬家了。不過，骨鯁在喉，不得不吐：雖然是一間汽車間，租費也並不便宜，這是普遍的現象，不用著談什麼良心問題了。可是租戶出了房租，房東理應負修葺之責，前天報上不是有一則坍樓的新聞嗎？大概也是年久失修，又借了學校，學生們跳躍爲戲的時候，竟發生了慘案。我住的汽車間，如果再發一决颶風，這些臨時支撑的木板，或者會被風吹去也說不定。抬高房價，不過是錢的問題，而現在竟置房客的生命都不顧了。</p>
<p>同時，這一年餘來，上海的房東都是腰纏萬貫了，請他們不嬰目光如豆，我們看到過並不鈹舊的房屋，因爲要加租，故意以拆造爲名來驅逐房客而鬧得兇毆訴訟，但是那些眞芷危在旦夕的房屋，爲什麼反而不問不聞呢？</p>
<p>現在冬天到了，大風大雪的時候，那些汽車間（和其他同樣簡單建造的房屋），以及年久失修的房屋，誰能担保沒有坍屋的慘案發生呢？這是比加租更嚴重的問題，希望各界人士予以注意！</p>

<h3>長想思　The　Old　Maid</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「這孩子不是屬於我的，因爲她爸爸並不屬於我！」這悽痛的呼聲並不祇是蓓蒂黛維絲一個人的悲哀，是封建社會所剝奪了終身幸福的千萬女人的悲哀呵！但是「長想思」的劇作者沒有芷面地攻擊封建社會，他是以一個動人的故事，側面地激動觀衆的心絃，那最後的一吻，那慘痛的微笑，並不是「安慰」，而是這不幸的女人的「結束」，正如那英文題名「老處女」，它諷刺的不是蓓蒂黛維絲，而是使蓓蒂黛維絲「處女」以終身的封建社會一樣。</p>
<p>看過蓓蒂黛維絲的「卿何薄命」，她的優秀的演技使我們不能忘了那個「自我犧牲」的女人，「長想思」更我們永遠記着那個「可憐」的卡洛特。常她結婚的那天，被她姊姊狄麗亞發現了克林的私生女停娜，從此她被剝奪了人生的幸福。她的女兒停娜結婚了，她終於不敢吿她自己是她的母親。蓓蒂黛維絲從少女到老年，每一塲戲都能激動觀衆的情緒，而且使觀衆由激動而同情，而憤怒！</p>
<p>導演者埃特密特谷丁也是非常細膩地把演員的情感在畫面上分析出來。譬如狄麗亞，卡洛特和停娜的結婚，他都能層决地分析着演員們各個不同的情感。允其是卡洛特帶着停娜來家居住，晚上孩子們安睡的時候，孩子們的和母親道晚安和姨母道晚安，他的細膩的手法「眞是動人之至。停娜和卡洛特的關係，最後結婚前後的戲，更是可愛。譬如藍尼送停娜歸來，卡洛特要衝出去的時候，狄麗亞從樓上下來，狄麗亞和停娜上樓，兩個黑影子，由小而大，幾乎像撲到蓓蒂黛維絲的身上來；卡洛特耍吿訴停娜道十幾年來的秘密，終於道了晚安出來；以及最後的吻別，他是充份地把握住了各個演員感情的流露。</p>
<p>鏡頭的活潑，和音樂配合的適當，允是餘事。</p>

<h3>Over a Thousand Japanese Troops Invade Western Shanxi in Four Routes, Repelled at Wu Xiang; Japanese Troops in Liaoxian Invade South in Three Routes, Failing; Artillery Battles Erupt on the Xinqiang to Jiuling Front</h3>
<p>Xingji: On the 5th, approximately one thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry troops from Xingji, Zitongzhen, Hetu Village in the "Southeast of Qin County," and "Southwest of Zitongzhen" launched disturbances in four routes towards the area south of Xianghua Wu Township. The Chinese army valiantly intercepted and fought fiercely throughout the day, ultimately defeating all the stubborn Japanese troops, who retreated in disarray towards Zitong, Xiadian, and the "West of Xiangyuan" areas. In addition, over four hundred Japanese troops from Liaoxian invaded south in three routes on the 2nd, but were routed by the Chinese army. They returned to harass with reinforcements until late at night, suffering another major defeat. It is estimated that dozens of Japanese troops were killed or wounded. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the 3rd, a Chinese unit attacked between Huguan and Qinzhuang, seizing over four hundred meters of Japanese communication wire. Another unit attacked the Japanese troops at Jiazhang (West of Huguan) on the night of the 2nd, charging with bayonets and killing over thirty Japanese soldiers. When a Japanese battalion arrived to reinforce, the Chinese army had already returned to their defense lines. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Since the 4th, in the mountainous area east of Xiangning, the Japanese have mobilized over two thousand troops from Fencheng, Xiwang, and Xiangling, and launched attacks in multiple routes. One route, with seven to eight hundred men, advanced from Duanshan Ridge, Aifu Ridge, and Youfeng Ridge towards Yun Tang Fort and Zhoujia Ridge. Another route, with five hundred men, advanced from Xiwang Village, Fencheng, to harass Huodu, Yukou, and Dongzhuang. The majority advanced aggressively through Niuwang Temple towards Tinghualing, Jinzhong Temple, and Taisan Temple areas. The Chinese army met them in separate routes, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the day in the Shiqiu and Hepo areas, collectively killing or wounding over one hundred Japanese troops. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<p>Xingji: On the morning of the 5th, over two hundred Japanese infantrymen and one vehicle harassed northward from Fenshui, but were bombarded by the Chinese artillery, killing many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, the Japanese troops retreated along the original route. (Reported on the 8th)</p>
<p>Xingji: In the second half of last month, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely for five days and nights along the line from Yanzhang, Laotaimiao, Gengnanguo, and Peishe in the southeast of Wenxi. The Chinese army achieved a complete victory. The course of events was as follows: Starting on the 22nd, over eight hundred Japanese troops gathered at Yanzhang and Laotaimiao, and harassed the area around Nanguo and Peishe. The Chinese garrison immediately rose up to resist forcefully, and fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. The Chinese army charged repeatedly, and the Japanese army retreated to Daxiaozhe. On the 23rd, over two thousand reinforcements were urgently dispatched from Xiaxian and Wenxi, along with thirty tanks and armored vehicles and over twenty aircraft. On the 25th, spearheaded by tanks, supported by aircraft, and coordinated by infantry, cavalry, and artillery, they launched a fierce attack on Nanguo, Peishe, Xiaowang and other villages. Chinese officers and soldiers engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the stubborn Japanese troops, and the fighting was extremely fierce. The Japanese troops advanced and retreated repeatedly, and the position was contested several times. The entire village of Peishe was destroyed by artillery fire. The Japanese once broke in and engaged in street fighting with the Chinese, but were quickly repulsed by the Chinese. As the battle raged until dusk, the Chinese army pressed on with renewed efforts, launching a fierce counterattack, and surrounded the Japanese from both left and right flanks. The stubborn Japanese troops continued to hold out, and after another night of fighting by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops, due to heavy casualties, finally broke through and retreated towards Wenxi at dawn on the 26th. It is estimated that three to four hundred Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. (Reported on the 8th)</p>
<p>Miluo: On the morning of the 9th, a localized artillery battle erupted again on the Xinqiang to Jiuling front. Furthermore, on the 9th, eight Japanese warships each sailed to Chenglingji and Yueyang Lake, and two of them once sailed to the outer reaches of the Xiangjiang River to reconnoiter. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<p>Shashi: The Chinese army crossed the river and attacked Bujie and Weijiajie, and other places, all of which have been recovered. On the morning of the 5th, Japanese troops from Nanxinjie and Luohansi launched attacks in multiple routes, attempting to encircle the Chinese troops. The Japanese artillery bombarded with over four hundred rounds of fire. The Chinese army responded calmly, and the Japanese launched several fierce attacks, all of which failed. By the afternoon, the Japanese could not hold out and retreated in separate routes. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Over 1,300 Japanese troops from Xinyang stirred up trouble in the Pingchangguan area on the 7th, but were intercepted by the Chinese army, who killed over a hundred of them. At the same time, the Chinese army at Dongshuanghe destroyed two Japanese vehicles, causing many casualties. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Erupts in the Puyuan Area</h3>
<p>Jinhua: On the 8th, over 500 Japanese troops from Jiaxing, over 500 Japanese troops from Wuzhen with thirty motorboats, and over 100 Japanese troops each from Chongde, Xieqiao, Xiashi, and Wangdian, advanced towards Puyuan, Tudian, and Haoziqiao. The Chinese army fought bravely to resist, and fierce fighting is underway on all fronts. In addition, over 300 Japanese troops from Chongde attacked the Chinese at Daxiao Gaoyang at 9:00 AM on the 9th, and the situation is still stalemated. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<h3>The CCP Issues a Resolution, Continuing Loyal Support for Chiang, Maintaining Strict Neutrality on the European War</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The resolution passed by the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party on October 10th was announced here today. Its main features are to express continued loyal support for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in resisting Japanese aggression. This resolution of the central supreme executive body is divided into three sections: the first section discusses the European war, the second section describes the Japanese invasion, and the third section discusses the relationship between the CCP and other parties and domestic affairs. Regarding the European war, the CCP advocates that China maintain the strictest neutrality. The second section points out the danger of the Japanese army continuing to penetrate deeply and advocates doing its best to prevent the Japanese from consolidating their current gains. As for domestic affairs, the resolution opposes surrendering to the enemy and reiterates the CCP's loyalty to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and advocates the establishment of a constitutional government.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly War Situation Report, Covering November 1st to 7th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week (November 1st to 7th), there have been no large-scale battles on any front. The Japanese troops in central Hubei and western Shanxi have been dealt heavy blows by the Chinese army and are now exhausted. The war is currently in a stalemate. The more important developments are described below:</p>
<p>Shanxi-Henan Front: The war situation in southeastern Shanxi has recently become quiet. Over a thousand Japanese troops in the Yongji area of southern Shanxi advanced towards Xuehua Mountain in three routes several days ago, but were met by the Chinese army in separate routes, resulting in many casualties. By the 5th, the Japanese troops on all routes had been defeated and routed. Since last week, Japanese troops in western Shanxi launched a large-scale westward offensive from Pu County, Lingshi, and Fencheng in three routes. Their main force successively invaded the counties of Xi, Ji, and Da Ning. Another unit of Japanese troops also occupied Jundu in the north, attempting to threaten the Chinese flank, but after a brave counter-offensive, Jundu was recovered. The Japanese offensive gradually weakened. From the 7th, the Chinese armies on all fronts adopted a tactic of encircling and assaulting the enemy, completely defeating the Japanese troops and restoring the original positions. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. In Shenchi and Wuzhai, in northern Shanxi, a combined force of over a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery advanced towards Sanjingzhen in multiple routes, and were bravely resisted. Another unit of the Chinese army also charged into the western gate of Jingle, killing many Japanese troops. The county seat is still controlled by the Chinese, and the Japanese are extremely panicked. In the area of Huaiyang, Tongxu, Qixian, Taikang, and Chenliu in eastern Henan, the Japanese have gathered four to five thousand troops and harassed the area in all directions over the past week, but have been repulsed by fierce attacks along the way. Another unit of the Chinese army also attacked the town of Baikou in Lanfeng, annihilating the Japanese troops there, and is now advancing towards the county seat.</p>
<p>Hubei Front: On the evening of the 3rd, the Japanese troops trapped in Beigang and Xishan in southern Hubei were subjected to a fierce attack, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the night. By dawn on the 4th, the Japanese abandoned over six hundred corpses and fled towards Tongcheng. Both places were recovered. The Japanese troops in central Hubei advanced towards the Chinese in two routes for several consecutive days. One route proceeded from Hanyangzhen and Caidian, via Jurushan, to attack Pengjiachang. The other route drew Japanese troops from Qianjiang and Hanchuan to force Xiantaozhen, and were supported by multiple Japanese aircraft, launching a combined land and air attack. The vanguard was very aggressive. Pengjiachang and Xiantaozhen fell successively. The vanguard invaded Mianyang and once even infiltrated Fengkou and Tonghaikou. After reinforcements and a counter-attack, fierce fighting ensued for two days and nights, killing over a thousand Japanese troops. Fengkou and Tonghaikou were successively recovered. The Japanese were routed in disarray and the Chinese army is pursuing them in the flush of victory. By noon on the 4th, there were no more traces of the Japanese in the city of Mianyang. The remaining Japanese troops in Xiantaozhen and Pengjiachang were also tightly surrounded and are in a state of collapse. The approximately one thousand troops of the Zhejiang River-style Regiment of the Japanese army in northern Hubei attacked Dushan and Chashan in the south of Suixian for several consecutive days. Both places were once occupied by the Japanese. Starting on the 3rd, the Chinese launched a brave counter-attack and both places were recovered. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and tightly surround the Zhejiang River. The battle for control was extremely fierce. The Japanese suffered over five hundred casualties. The Chinese captured a large amount of war spoils. (Reported on the 9th) (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan's Statement on Naval Achievements</h3>
<p>Chongqing: In an article published today in a military monthly magazine, Navy Commander Chen Shaokuan described the Chinese Navy's participation in the current Sino-Japanese War. He stated that before the war, the Chinese Navy was divided into the First, Second, and Training Fleets, with a total of approximately 8,500 officers and soldiers. Some smaller warships were used for coastal patrols. In addition, there were two brigades of marines and two large battalions of reserves. Many Chinese naval officers had received training in the British Navy. After the outbreak of war on August 13, 1937, the Chinese Navy's first action was to sink the old transport ship Pu'an in the southern Huangpu River to protect the flank of the Chinese army in the South City. After August 20, Japanese aircraft targeted the Chinese Navy's various agencies in Shanghai, Mawei, and Xiamen as targets for their air raids. As a result, the naval headquarters, shipyards, hospitals, aircraft factories, marine barracks, and coastal patrol stations were all bombed. On September 29, several Chinese naval personnel carried several mines before dawn, entered the water from Pudong, and swam towards the Japanese cruiser Izumo. When they were thirty yards from the ship, they were discovered by the Japanese, who opened fire with machine guns. These men released the mines, which were carried away by the strong current and missed the ship by a few yards. Chen also stated that the Chinese Navy had gathered along the Yangtze River to prepare for war two days before the outbreak of war, and had removed or destroyed all the pontoons, lightships, water markers, and other navigation markers in the lower reaches of Jiangyin. The next day, a water barrier was built downstream of the Jiangyin Fort, with a total of thirty-five ships, totaling 63,800 tons, sunk. Subsequently, eight tugboats and 185 sailboats, as well as 2,354 tons of stone, were sunk to strengthen the water barrier. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<h3>British Consul in Kunming Transferred to Tengyue</h3>

<h3>Sino-Soviet Air Service to Open Soon; Construction of Xinjiang Airfield Completed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It was officially announced here today that direct postal and passenger air service between China and the Soviet Union via Xinjiang will be opened soon. The section from Chongqing to Hami will be operated by the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation. It is understood that negotiations between the Chinese and Soviet governments on this route have lasted for more than a year. The final preparations for the Sino-Soviet air route were only completed a few months ago after the British Imperial Airways Company and the Chinese government agreed on the Chongqing-Rangoon route. The construction of the Xinjiang airfield has made the official opening of the new route imminent. According to the latest news received here, these airfields have now been completed. Before Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression treaty, Eurasia's business was not allowed to pass Lanzhou. At that time, it was planned that the Ministry of Communications would operate the route from Chongqing to Hami, but the rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union has apparently overcome this difficulty. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chongqing-Hami (Xinjiang Province) air route will be launched in the near future by Eurasia Aviation Corporation. Eurasia Aviation Corporation had previously opened an air route from Xinjiang Province to the Soviet border several years ago, and had planned to connect with the European air route at the time, but this did not materialize due to the political situation. Now it may be possible. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Celebrates Soviet Revolution</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news received here today, the crowd celebrating the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution here last night numbered 20,000 people. Soviet Ambassador to China Pan Youxin and Chinese General Feng Yuxiang were both in attendance. At the same time, Soviet films were also screened. At midnight, the Chinese crowd sang the Chinese and Soviet national anthems and dispersed in joy. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Provides Relief to Wounded Soldiers and Refugees</h3>
<p>Guilin: Due to the victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan, President Kong has remitted 100,000 to Director Bai to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. Bai telegraphed Kong on the 8th to express his thanks, and has remitted all of these funds to the front lines for proper allocation and distribution. (Reported on the 9th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Leaves Chongqing for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Chongqing: British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, accompanied by his secretary Tighe, flew to Hong Kong from here this afternoon. Dong Xianguang represented Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang at the airfield to see him off. In addition, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Executive Yuan were also present. Before his departure, he was entertained by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at a banquet. During his stay in Chongqing, the ambassador met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Foreign Minister Wang, and other senior officials. The ambassador also had lengthy talks with Communist Party leaders Chen Shaoyu and Qin Bangxian. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left here by plane for Hong Kong today. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry officials, although the British ambassador and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui often met, they did not discuss any particular issues. Such meetings are extremely natural, as the British ambassador is constantly maintaining close contact with the Chinese government. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Discusses the Future of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Washington: According to Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese delegate to the Pacific International Exchange Conference, it is expected that when the current European war ends, the countries that have suffered from the ravages of war will still turn to the League of Nations for help. "But if the countries of the world still try to establish a League of Nations, then the League of Nations they establish should be a League of Nations with the power to implement peace. Under the organization of this kind of League of Nations, the sovereignty of each country must be sacrificed in part for the common good. In other words, this new League of Nations should be a supra-national state, a supra-national government, and its power to maintain world peace, justice, and reasonable international relations must be greater than that of the current League of Nations. For the happiness of society, individuals are often willing to sacrifice part of their freedom, so certain actions are often decided by the parliament or the police, and there is no regret or complaint. Since individuals can do this, then countries, in order to avoid disaster, can only sacrifice part of their sovereignty for peace and justice. At the same time, in order for this League of Nations to be effective, countries from all over the world should be required to join it." Dr. Yan was invited today to a banquet by Mr. Hamilton, Director of the Far Eastern Department of the US State Department, and Mr. Bake, political adviser to the State Department.

<h3>Sichuan Establishes Opium Suppression Inspection Group, Huang Jilu as Head, Hu Ciwei as Deputy; You Ying and Others from the Ministry of Interior Participate in the Work</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The six-year deadline for opium suppression is imminent. It is now the end of autumn in the 28th year of the Republic, and according to opium planting customs, it is the time to sow opium seedlings. Previously, the Executive Yuan issued an organizational outline for opium suppression inspection groups to various provinces, instructing the provinces of Sichuan, Kangding, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Fujian to implement it accordingly. The Sichuan group has been established ahead of schedule, divided into ten groups, and with the approval of the Ministry of Interior, the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan have jointly appointed Huang Jilu as the head of the group and Hu Ciwei as the deputy head. The members of the group will be concurrently filled by current personnel recommended by various military, political, and party agencies in Sichuan Province. As the Ministry of Interior is the competent authority for opium suppression, it has now appointed inspectors You Ying, Zhang Dingxin, Huang Junwei, Gao Chaozong, Xie Fu, Pan Jue, Yu Liangmo, Li Wonan, Zhang Xiapu, and Liu Cheng to participate in the aforementioned work. Four days ago, Zhang Weihan, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Interior, personally visited the Opium Suppression Commission, and together with Standing Committee Member Li Zhonggong, convened the inspectors for a training session, encouraging them to endure hardship, take responsibility, and eradicate opium. They were also instructed to take a special train to Chengdu immediately to await assignment to various counties to supervise and strictly prohibit opium planting. The provinces of Kangding, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Fujian are also being instructed by the Ministry of Interior to the Opium Suppression Commission to begin preparations, and they will be able to proceed in separate routes in the near future.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>For the past three days, Japanese newspapers have uniformly begun to roar at the United States, saying they are not afraid to fight the United States, saying they will soon be on friendly terms with the Soviet Union. The donkey of Guizhou has exhausted its tricks, putting on a brave face to conceal inner cowardice, making it extremely ugly. However, it should be viewed separately. The government authorities are still reserved.</p>
<p>Japanese diplomacy is actually very shallow, coquettish, and artificial, always trying to use small tricks to deceive the world and fool them, but failing to conceal its beggarly appearance everywhere. Without discussing distant matters, let us describe recent events: From the launching of the military invasion of China to the occupation of Wuhan, in the midst of their intoxicated dreams, like a poor child suddenly becoming rich, walking with high heads and arrogance, regarding any other country or any other matter with contempt. This was the scene half a year ago. And the United States announced the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, and the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression agreement. Although they tried to maintain their stern posture, they were still wandering on the streets, not knowing where to go. The Hiruma cabinet fell and the Abe cabinet took power, actually planning to change their style and seek international acceptance. But before long, the European war broke out, and they gained another dreamland, thinking that fate had given them an opportunity to manipulate. Who knew that they would be defeated militarily in northern Hunan, and warned internationally by the United States, and so they had to find another way. Where is that other way? The German route just led into a trap, the British and French route was slow to help. These two can only be used as tools of diplomatic magic. Beyond these two, only the Soviet Union and the United States remained. The Soviet Union is not an easy acquaintance, and Japanese national and social education for the past twenty years has created "an irreconcilable hatred between the Soviet Union and Japan." Therefore, only the United States remained. The United States, the country to whom Japan bows to the extreme. On October 20, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew gave a frank and clear public warning. The Japanese did not get angry or resentful, but praised it as "frank." On November 4, Ambassador Grew met with Foreign Minister Nomura and made a written summary of the public warning. The Japanese said that the prospect of establishing mutual understanding between the U.S. and Japan was very bleak. In the following two or three days, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman successively hinted at concrete actions against Japan. House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson revealed a large-scale naval expansion plan. All of these are what Japan cannot withstand. On November 8, Japanese newspapers pretended to attack the United States. How did they attack the U.S.? They said they would contact the Soviet Union. The authorities are reserved, but Japan is not a country with freedom of speech.</p>
<p>The above shows the recent actions of Japanese diplomacy. How could it be called diplomacy? The sun is setting and the road is long. It seizes its national destiny and the lives of its people to "charge wildly" and "ram wildly." Well done, the United States responded to their roars by formally announcing yesterday from Washington that they would strengthen air and naval forces in the Pacific!</p>
<p>Japan recklessly charges and rams wildly. Will it combine with the Soviet Union? Will a Soviet-Japanese combination cause further chaos in the Far East? We firmly believe that the Soviet Union will only solve the scattered outstanding issues with Japan and at most restore normal international relations. Because the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty limits the Soviet Union from concluding any international treaty that is detrimental to China's resistance to aggression. Recent announcements and speeches from the Soviet Union's October Revolution commemoration festival are especially credible. The Soviet Union likes to make surprising moves, and the treaty with Germany is one example. However, the purpose of the Soviet-German treaty was to deal with Britain, and the initial aim was not to divide the spoils. If Japan has the courage to fight the United States, as Germany did with England, then Soviet-Japanese relations can be improved, as Soviet-German relations have been. But can Japan fight the United States?</p>
<p>Japan has invaded China for over two years, and is exhausted. Its economy does not allow it to wage war with other countries. Its elite army has suffered more than half casualties, and its air force has little left. Its military does not allow it to wage war with other countries. The navy is still able to maintain its third-place international ranking, but today it can only rely on the navy to maintain its international position. Would it dare to bet everything on a single throw? The state of the country does not allow it to wage war with other countries. The raw materials for waging war against China depend entirely on overseas supplies, especially from the United States. Its materials fundamentally do not allow it to wage war, let alone against the United States! Even if the Soviet Union agrees to provide assistance, the possible amount of assistance is negligible and cannot maintain Japan's wartime consumption. It is generally known that it is absolutely impossible. Moreover, in terms of Japan itself, is it possible to combine with the Soviet Union to fight the U.S.? How will the authorities formulate words to report this to the Emperor and to inform the people? It is no different than demolishing the great defense of their national founding ideology. Is it possible?</p>
<p>Today, Japan's only hope is that the United States will only show its current attitude and not take concrete action. This kind of hope is also Japan's assessment and hope for the United States for several years. However, in our observation, U.S. policy is firm and stable, always having its predetermined steps, its just goals, its determination to implement, and the strength to put them into practice. To think that the unanimous roaring of Japanese newspapers today, or the bluffing of the Japanese authorities in the future, will make the United States apprehensive and change its policies, this is definitely not the case. Moreover, the so-called arms embargo is by no means an unprecedentedly serious measure in the United States. For the past two years, the United States has continued to export large quantities of military supplies and raw materials to Japan, providing the means for invasion and slaughter, and contributing to the destruction of international peace and order. This is actually a "legal crime" in the United States. Do American officials and the public have no moral concept, do they not know this? Therefore, by January of next year, the actual form of the so-called arms embargo by the United States will only be that after the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, U.S.-Japan trade will naturally return to "blank paper" only, there is nothing else. If it does not return to blank paper, then China and those who sympathize with China can appeal to the American officials and the public: Do not assist aggression again! Do not assist slaughter again! Moreover, it also proves by the roaring of Japan today that although the United States assists aggression and slaughter, it will inevitably bite back at the United States in the future.</p>
<h3>British Authorities Take Notice of American Envoy's Remarks in Japan; Plan to Archive Them in the Congressional Library; Japanese Newspapers Conduct Anti-American Propaganda</h3>
<p>London – Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Halifax does not intend to publish the full text of Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent interview with a reporter from the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun regarding Anglo-Japanese relations as a white paper. However, the full text of the speech given by American Ambassador to Japan Grew in Tokyo on October 20th will be archived in the House of Commons Library. Labour MP Noel-Baker asked if the Undersecretary could guarantee that the Prime Minister's remarks to the Asahi Shimbun reporter were based on the fundamental principles of past foreign policy. Butler replied, "Yes, the British government's policy is unified and fundamental." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today continued to criticize the United States' tough Far East policy. "Asahi Shimbun" warned that unless the United States lifts its oppression of Japan, "Japan will rise up and fight the United States." Japanese newspapers condemned the American plan to ban arms exports to Japan and the Vincent Naval Expansion Act, which requires US$1,750,000,000. Japanese newspapers described this as "an example of arrogant Americanism" and said that if the United States continues to oppress Japan, Japan will develop close relations with the Soviet Union. Today, Japanese newspapers also threatened the United States, saying that if the United States uses a "two-pronged" approach of banning arms exports to Japan and expanding its navy against Japan, Japan will refuse to "protect" American interests in China. No matter what pressure the United States applies, Japan will not change its determination to establish a "new order" in the Far East. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun stated, "Japan is prepared to rise up and resist the United States to safeguard the survival of the Japanese nation." The remarks made by American Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman about imposing economic sanctions on Japan may be a form of intimidation before Japan and the United States hold negotiations. If the United States believes that Japan is eager to establish friendly relations with the United States, it would be better not to hold a meeting. According to the Jiji Shimbun, if the United States ignores the facts and talks loftily about legal principles, the problems between Japan and the United States will be difficult to resolve. Therefore, if the two countries do not want to resolve the outstanding issues, so be it. If they want to resolve the outstanding issues, mutual concessions are necessary. However, the only way to resolve the outstanding issues is to maintain mutual concessions without engaging in empty talk. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Preparation for Negotiations on Outstanding Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will negotiate with Japanese Ambassador Togo in Moscow to resolve the disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and Soviet Ambassador Smetanin will also meet in Tokyo soon. The Soviet Ambassador will visit Nomura within a few days to prepare for the expected meeting. The result of the talks between Molotov and Togo is that it has been agreed to establish a joint Japanese-Manchukuo-Soviet-Mongolian committee to demarcate the border of the recent war zone in Nomonhan. It is expected that the committee will meet in Chita soon. Given the attitude to be adopted by the participants, the negotiations are expected to proceed smoothly. At the same time, Colonel Livanov, the naval attaché of the Soviet Embassy, met with reporters when he departed for Vladivostok on Sunday for a vacation back home, saying that Soviet-Japanese friendship could definitely be enhanced, and said, "I am confident that Japanese-Soviet relations will gradually improve in the future. As far as China is concerned, there is unlikely to be anything that would cause concern about the relations between the two countries. Ambassador Smetanin will definitely inform the Japanese authorities of the Soviet Union's wishes frankly as soon as possible. I believe that bilateral negotiations will be held in Tokyo to adjust general relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, proceeding in parallel with the meetings in Moscow and Chita. I heard that Ambassador Smetanin will hold a meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to China soon, but I am not at liberty to disclose the location of the meeting." (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo published an editorial today stating that after viewing the speech given by Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to the Supreme Soviet on October 31st, it is not difficult to guess the mission of the new Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Smetanin. In the past, whenever attempts were made to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, various difficulties would arise. However, various outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, such as the border dispute between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, fishery issues, and the issue of concessions for oil and coal on Sakhalin Island, can be resolved. It is now urgent to find an opportunity to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible, without regard to Japan's negotiations with Britain and the United States. The Yomiuri Shimbun also published an article on the same issue, stating that the relationship between the Soviet Union issue and the handling of the China Incident is far more important than the issue of adjusting American-Japanese relations. The Soviet Union has been seeking to open up opportunities for twenty years, and now this opportunity has arrived for the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Budget for the Next Fiscal Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Japan Times reported today that although non-urgent expenditures have been greatly reduced in Japan's budget for the next fiscal year, it will still exceed 10,500,000,000 Japanese yen. The total amount of ordinary budget expenditures is expected to be 5,000,000,000 yen, and military expenditures will be 5,500,000,000 yen. The budget for this year is 8,874,000,000 yen.

<p>Washington – The US Navy has ordered two more destroyers to be assigned to the patrol fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, the number of escort ships on the East Coast has now increased to over eighty. At the same time, the construction of nine airfields and other facilities on the East Coast and in the Caribbean is also being expedited in the hope of early completion. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Socialist Party Petition for Food Rice Monopoly</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – A Tokyo dispatch reports that the Japanese Social Masses Party has recently submitted a petition to Prime Minister Abe, requesting the government to imitate the precedents of tobacco and salt monopolies and implement a food rice monopoly. The main points include: (1) The government should implement a food rice monopoly so that the price of rice can be in an appropriate proportion to the prices of other major commodities. (2) The government should review the overall situation of the food problem and draft practical measures so that the distribution of food (including the implementation of a rationed food system) can proceed smoothly. (3) The provisions of the National General Mobilization Law should be fully implemented. (4) Increase rice production, etc. The seriousness of the food problem in Japan is evident from this.

The ceremony will conclude tonight, at which time Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, will deliver a speech. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Munich – Leader Hitler delivered a speech to veteran National Socialist Party members here last night. Shortly after he left the venue, a bombing occurred, killing six people and injuring about sixty who had not yet left the venue. The people of Munich are very angry about this act of violence and have offered a reward of 500,000 marks for the arrest of the culprit. Leader Hitler arrived in Munich yesterday to participate in the ceremony commemorating the National Socialist Party members who rose up in Munich in 1923. Due to important official business in Berlin that required Leader Hitler's personal attention, he left Munich early and departed by special train for Berlin last night. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Munich – Yesterday, a bomb exploded in the cellar of the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich. The explosion was quite powerful, and half of the ceiling was destroyed. Fortunately, there were only about a hundred people in the hall at the time, and they were preparing to leave, so the damage was relatively small. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Six people died and twenty-nine were seriously injured in the Munich bombing, and several others were slightly injured. National Socialist Party dignitaries were unharmed. According to well-informed sources, foreign newspaper reports that Hitler's representative Hess was also injured are completely inaccurate. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Munich – It has been confirmed that eight people died in the Munich bombing. Their names are as follows: (1) Rödl, a member of Hitler's stormtroopers in Munich; (2) Kaiser, a merchant near Munich; (3) Weber, a radio reporter; (4) Reindl, a clerk; (5) Kasper-Gartner, a member of the Munich military band; (6) Schächter, a radio station employee; (7) two unnamed men. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The Munich bombing is under investigation. Political figures in Berlin believe that all the current evidence indicates that the mastermind is related to foreign countries.

(Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Hitler arrived at Anhalter Bahnhof this morning by special train from Munich. Police officers guarded the east entrance of the station to prevent assassination attempts. Key figures such as General Göring left the station with him. Hitler took a specially prepared car to the Chancellery. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Denounces Britain, Prepares for Five-Year War, States Germany Will Not Surrender</h3>
<p>Berlin – Leader Hitler delivered a speech to veteran National Socialist Party members and the families of the fallen martyrs in Munich, where the National Socialist Party uprising took place last night, declaring that this day in 1923 was a critical moment for the German nation because it was the first time after the Treaty of Versailles that the German nation was awakened and began a revival movement, the result of which was the birth of Greater Germany. Hitler then recounted the reasons for the failure in 1919, generally stating that preparations were not sufficient at the beginning of the war in 1914. As for today, he himself and the German nation are convinced that Britain and France cannot defeat Germany. The reason why Germany failed in World War I was that the government at the time was weak and could not resist those in Britain who incited the war, such as Churchill. At this point, Hitler spoke at length about Britain's wartime slogans, saying that Britain always concocts excuses for every war. One says it fights for small countries, and another says it fights for justice. Indeed, as a result of Britain fighting for small countries and for justice for three hundred years, it has acquired 40 million square kilometers of foreign land and 480 million people of other races. Is this what Britain calls justice? Furthermore, it says that Britain is fighting for culture. If that is the case, then Britain should pay attention to the culture of the poor areas in its mining areas and large cities, which is more urgent than engaging in war. It also says that Britain is not fighting against the German people, but against the German government, and that its purpose is to liberate the German people from the oppression of the militarist government. Although its words are clever, the facts are obvious. In fact, Britain's policy for three hundred years can be summarized in one sentence: to subjugate all countries. Even the League of Nations is just a tool used to maintain the status quo. British cabinet members shout that the German government has no credibility. In fact, Britain has repeatedly promised Germany equal rights and the return of its colonies, making solemn vows, but failing to fulfill its promises. Britain's goal is to plunge Germany into poverty and distress. Little does it know that it is precisely because of the oppression of this evil force that Germany has been reborn again. Hitler then said that he had ordered General Göring to prepare a five-year war plan, not because he thought the war would last for five years, but to show that Germany was determined not to surrender. Hitler then solemnly declared that his last speech in the Reichstag was the final declaration to the international situation, and that in the future, he would only deal with it in a language that Britain could understand.

<p>The British Aircraft Carrier Courageous, Sunk by a German Submarine</p>
<h3>Why are Germans Smuggling Dutch Uniforms?</h3>
<p>The Hague, Netherlands – The Netherlands is currently closely monitoring the "Uniform" espionage case. A few days ago, the authorities discovered that Dutch people were attempting to smuggle various types of Dutch uniforms into Germany. A large-scale search was launched, and four Germans were arrested in Hengelo, near the border. It turned out that someone speaking German in Deventer wanted to buy Dutch military hats. The hat maker became suspicious and recorded the person's car number, reporting it to the authorities. As a result, the police were able to capture the four Germans in the car in Hengelo. According to yesterday's report, authorities discovered a German plane in a garage while searching a residence. According to investigations, a group of people are trying to smuggle various uniforms worn by Dutch tram conductors to cavalry officers into Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Declares that Britain Has Controlled the German Submarine Offensive; Gains Outweigh Losses in the Past Two Months; The Danger Still Exists but Preparations Have Been Made</h3>
<p>London – First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill stated in the House of Commons today, "I can now say more definitively what I told the House of Commons six weeks ago, namely that we are gradually gaining the upper hand in the attack on submarines. Germany has boasted to the world about the loss of British ships. I can answer that we are willing to use only the warships that Germany claims to have destroyed to deal with the entire German Navy. German radio has repeatedly said that the British ship Ark Royal has been sunk. In fact, one of the most valuable spoils of war recently captured from the Germans is this Ark Royal. In the second month after the outbreak of the war, the British ships sunk by the Germans totaled 72,000 tons, less than half of what was lost in the first month. During this period, we captured 52,000 tons of enemy ships, purchased 27,000 tons from foreign countries, and built 57,000 tons of new ships. After offsetting the losses, there was a net gain of 64,000 tons. Statistically, in the eight weeks after the outbreak of the war, the net loss of our ships was less than three percent. During these eight weeks, over 10 million tons of goods were imported into Britain, with less than 250,000 tons lost. However, over 400,000 tons of goods destined for Germany were captured. The initial implementation of the British convoy system inevitably caused some delays in shipping traffic, but the delays can be greatly reduced after the full implementation of the convoy system. We have withdrawn hundreds of the largest merchant ships in these two months to install self-defense armaments. This matter is still in progress, which is also one of the reasons for the delays in shipping. It is extremely difficult to determine how many German submarines have been lost because many submarines sink into the deep sea without leaving a trace. However, according to a conservative estimate, the loss of German submarines should be two to three per week. We may assume that Germany can build two new submarines each week, which would amount to twenty submarines in ten weeks. According to this calculation, Germany will have a total of one hundred submarines by January next year, excluding the number that have been sunk during this time. Therefore, we still have a great struggle ahead of us. For this reason, our preparations are now actively underway on the largest scale. The number of ships searching for German submarines is now three times more than at the beginning of the war. From next spring, a large number of new ships specially suitable for searching for submarines will be built one after another. Therefore, in terms of material aspects alone, we can be optimistic about the future. Although we may suffer extremely hateful attacks, we have now made preparations for prevention. I want to warn the House of Commons that continued losses are expected and that it cannot be guaranteed that losses will be avoided at any time. In addition to submarines, we also have to deal with enemy ships on the surface. Germany has one or two pocket battleships that have indeed been sailing in the Atlantic Ocean for the past six months. However, although these German ships have been lurking on the shipping lanes used by Atlantic convoys, they have not dared to carry out large-scale captures of merchant ships. To date, only two ships have been sunk by them, totaling 10,000 tons, far less than the 202,000 tons sunk by submarines. The crisis still exists today, so I am issuing this warning. However, it is comforting that the submarine war has been controlled, and the attacks by surface warships and armed merchant ships have not yet developed to a serious degree. The French Navy is now also powerful, unlike before, not only assisting the British Navy in accordance with the various methods agreed upon before the war, but also sharing the work undertaken by the British Navy. France is making great efforts on land and providing powerful assistance to the Allied countries at sea, which is truly amazing. Now, in the ninth week of the war, we have very good hopes for the sea." Churchill also reported on the loss of the British submarine Oxley, saying that the submarine was lost due to an accidental internal explosion. The cause of the explosion has not yet been announced. What can be announced is that four officers and forty-two soldiers died. As for the losses caused by the Germans, they are announced at any time. The House of Commons should know that the large-scale war currently underway is seen only at sea in fact, and the losses are not limited to those at sea. For example, the loss of the battleship Oak has now been found to be caused by a German submarine invading the defenses of the anchorage in Scapa Flow and firing a torpedo. The authorities have now made plans to strengthen the defenses of Scapa Flow. The crew of the ship were very confident in the defenses of Scapa Flow and never expected anything to happen. When the ship was hit by the first torpedo, experienced crew members did not suspect a torpedo but suspected an aerial attack. Even the captain suspected an internal explosion inside the hull. In an instant, the enemy ship's second batch of torpedoes was fired. The Navy Department, which bears great responsibility, has decided after this lesson that in this new type of war with all kinds of novel weapons, one must never be confident in safety. The First Lord of the Admiralty also said that since the outbreak of the war, the loss of British naval lives has been greater than the total losses of Britain and France in all other aspects.

<h3>Turkey Implements Demobilization</h3>
<p>Ankara, Turkey – According to a newspaper report, the government has decided to demobilize all levels of reservists who were called up after the outbreak of the European war. It is believed that Turkey is now in a favorable situation, so demobilization is possible. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Ankara, Turkey – Foreign Minister Saracoğlu stated when the parliament approved the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty that this agreement could become a very important turning point in world history. The efforts of Britain, France, and Turkey for peace will become more effective and produce greater results in the future. This treaty has opened up happy new memories for Turkey in the political, social, and economic spheres. At a time when the world is encountering misfortune, it is appropriate for Turkey to join the strong group led by the strongest countries. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>New York Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>New York – In today's New York foreign exchange market, the British pound continued to weaken under constant pressure, while the Belgian franc reached a new low in the past six years. This was due to rumors that Germany might violate Belgian neutrality. The British pound closed at $3.91, down three points from yesterday. The Belgian franc closed at 16.52, down 0.19 from yesterday. The Dutch guilder closed at 53.08, down 0.01 from yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Nordic Heads of State Respond to Belgian-Dutch Peace Appeal; West Reads Chamberlain's Speech Reaffirming Determination to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>The Hague – Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, together with King Leopold III of Belgium, sent a telegram to the three nations of England, France, and Germany to mediate a truce. Subsequently, the Kings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and the President of Finland, have all telegraphed their approval (Havas, 8th).</p>
<p>Beijing – Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, after accompanying King Leopold of Belgium to The Hague for a meeting with the Queen of the Netherlands, has already returned here and subsequently received the envoys of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Poland. The content of the discussion has not been disclosed (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>London – Regarding the mediation of a truce by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, the British and French governments exchanged opinions all day today. Foreign Secretary Halifax met twice with the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, for talks. According to political figures, the replies from Britain and France will likely reiterate the war aims and conditions for peace, as repeatedly declared by Prime Minister Chamberlain. At this time, the consultation is not about the content of the reply, but rather deliberating on the manner of response (Havas, 8th).</p>
<p>London – The Ministry of Information has recently issued a message stating, "The broadcast speech delivered by Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday was actually regarded by the German Foreign Ministry as an answer to the mediation of a truce by the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands. In fact, the Foreign Secretary was completely unaware of this matter when drafting the speech, and the mediation proposal should be carefully considered by King George VI. This has already been announced by Prime Minister Chamberlain to the House of Commons" (Havas, 8th).</p>
<p>London – Today at noon, a banquet was held at the residence of the Lord Mayor of London. Prime Minister Chamberlain was unable to attend due to illness, so he delegated Finance Minister Simon to read the speech. The speech first mentioned the peace proposals of the heads of state of Belgium and the Netherlands, saying that the two heads of state made a great offer with noble intentions, which is deeply appreciated. However, given past experiences, Hitler may not respond satisfactorily. Before the British government makes a reply, it must consult with the dominions and allied countries fighting alongside it. This war is determined to be the most peculiar in history. Although the war has been going on for some time, it must be made to seem as if there is no war at all, but only a form of siege. The government cannot predict how long this war will last, or when it will suddenly turn into a fierce battle. However, in recent weeks, the position of the allied forces has not deteriorated as a result, and has even been strengthened. The alliance of Britain, France, and Turkey can be a powerful tool for peace in Southeastern Europe. The Soviet-German pact only benefits the Soviet Union unilaterally, while Germany only suffers humiliation and loss. The United States' removal of the arms embargo, reopening the gateway for allied countries to rely on the world's largest arsenal, is a crucial move. The strength of the British navy, army, and air force has proven that they can be trusted to cope with any task entrusted to them in the future. The British government knows that the relocation of hundreds of thousands of children to the countryside involves various dangers and pains, but the experience gained in the last great war shows that we should start early to avoid hasty mistakes. The issue of domestic defense lines is not very different from what was required in the last great war, but there are important new factors involved. We should apply relentless economic pressure on the "enemy," and we should obtain the essential goods needed by Britain, just as in the beginning of the last great war. The number of armed forces mobilized now is already huge, and even if it does not exceed the number in the last great war, it will be comparable to it. Because the various armies must be mechanized, the equipment work is much more expensive and complex than before. All additional expenses have created new problems in terms of foreign exchange. It is not surprising that the manufacturing and supply should be greatly controlled, including some restrictions on exports. This is because only in this way can the goods that Britain must need be used sparingly, and prevent the goods needed by Germany from being transferred to them. When the Great War broke out in 1914, the national finances gradually transitioned from a state of peace to a state of war. The payment of cash by banks was suspended for financial reasons, but this was enough due to careful preparation for a one-day bank holiday. The implementation of foreign exchange control has become an innovative measure. Although it has not yet started in full, it has quickly achieved results with the assistance of banks and other financial institutions. In other countries, it takes years to reach this point. We should not neglect our shipping and exchange resources, because although they are vast, they are not without limits. We do not know how long the war will last. We must prepare to fight until we achieve final victory. For the input of military deployments, we must compete for shipping space and foreign exchange, while at the same time taking care of the needs of the civilians. Now, we hope that when people cannot buy luxury imports, cannot obtain sufficient gasoline to drive their cars, and even have to give up the food they are accustomed to seeing on their breakfast tables, they should not forget that all of this is to help the country obtain more ships and foreign exchange for our war effort. In the first few weeks of the war, one of the most remarkable things is the unity of the people of the whole country. In our determination to complete the scheduled responsibilities, we have obtained the support of all classes, parties, and races in the country. We can truly claim to have a broader unity, that is, the unity of the empire. We can see in the dominions, India, and the great colonial empire the same belief in our principles and the same result of making them victorious. We have the most complete and sincere understanding with France. With this spirit and with such allies, we are determined not to be reduced to failure. Therefore, we firmly believe that we will see the foundation of a new world laid, where freedom and humanism will replace oppression and the rule of force (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>London – The Times commented that our minimum conditions have recently been stated by the Prime Minister, who said, "Our goal is well known, namely, to liberate Europe from the continuous fear of German aggression, and to enable the people of Europe to maintain their independence and freedom." This declaration, of course, should not be changed in any situation, and it must be added that we have guaranteed that we will not consider any peace treaty without the participation of the Polish government. Some suspect that the joint peace movement by the monarchs of the Netherlands and Belgium at this time is related to the rumors that the neutrality of the Netherlands and Belgium is currently threatened. This statement, however, does not reflect the pure and selfless nature of the Dutch and Belgian monarchs' desire for peace. Indeed, German propaganda has accused the Netherlands and Belgium of non-neutral actions, criticizing them on one hand for allowing freedom of speech, resulting in newspapers daring to attack German policies, and on the other hand for acquiescing to England's exercise of its blockade rights permitted by international law. Considering the fate of other small countries on the German border, how can the Netherlands and Belgium not be suspicious of what these accusations portend? (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated today that the governments of the Netherlands and Belgium have not directly notified the United States of their joint peace appeal, nor have they asked the United States to participate in any efforts to end the war (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<h3>Aerial Battle Over the North Sea; German Planes Distribute Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>London – The Ministry of Aviation has recently issued a message stating that two of our reconnaissance planes engaged in combat with three German planes over the North Sea. One German plane was shot down into the sea. The pilot of the second plane seemed to have lost control and crashed. It is difficult to confirm whether we shot it down. The third plane escaped after running out of ammunition. In addition, several of our planes flew to northwestern Germany yesterday for reconnaissance and took many important photos. Afterwards, all but one plane safely returned to base (Havas, 8th).</p>
<p>Luxembourg – A British plane landed in Esch, southern Luxembourg, this morning. According to the pilot, he pursued and shot down two German planes, flying to a height of 23,000 feet, and believed he was over French territory, so he landed. The pilot has been detained and the plane has been confiscated (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<p>Paris – Germany sent many planes today to the skies over the allied lines and the interior of France for reconnaissance. It is reported that German planes carried out three air raids on the land. Recent French war reports state that there is unusual activity on the front lines (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<p>Paris – Today, Le Petit Parisien reported a dispatch from Maurice stating that a Nazi plane scattered leaflets printed with a speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov over the Allied lines and the outskirts of Paris as propaganda. The plane had been disguised, and all the leaflets were printed to resemble communist propaganda. Maurice also stated that in the past 24 hours, British and French planes had jointly conducted reconnaissance flights over German territory (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>French Finance Minister Explains; War Aims; Not Material Interests; But to Fulfill Ideals</h3>
<p>Paris – Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a speech at a luncheon at the American Club today, explaining the war aims and conditions for peace, stating that not far from our country, there is now a nation that only knows how to worship force and regard it as the only moral concept. Various illegal acts abound. The assassination of former Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, the successive occupation of Czechoslovakia and Poland, are all acts of violence by that country. To this day, Nazi Germany is even proclaiming, "Give me time to digest what I have plundered. After digestion, my strength will become even greater, and I will continue to act." If we give Germany a chance to breathe, we will be attacked by that country again in six months. You may tell me that some people do not know this crisis, but you cannot say that this crisis does not exist. It must be understood that if Germany wins, civilized Europe will come to an end. The French nation has automatically accepted all kinds of sacrifices for the sake of defending freedom. We firmly believe that this spirit will surely overcome the enemy. Finance Minister Reynaud concluded by saying, "The aim of the British and French allies in going to war is not to seek material interests, but to fulfill their ideals. To all who can hear my speech, whether friend or foe, I must declare to them that we have no choice but to go to war, and we must go all out, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. If the enemy wants to engage in total war, we want to lay the foundation for total peace." After Finance Minister Reynaud finished speaking, the audience responded with warm applause (Havas, 9th).</p>
<h3>Dutch Military Authorities Decide; To Expand Flooded Areas; To Prevent Foreign Invasion from the East</h3>
<p>London – According to reports from Amsterdam, Dutch military authorities have decided to expand the flooded areas and flood a certain key area of the Dutch Water Line to prevent foreign invasion from the east. According to observers, if the German army advances rapidly into the Netherlands to occupy positions for attacking England, the flooding may cause difficulties, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle. People here generally believe that the joint peace movement launched by the monarchs of Belgium and the Netherlands is due to the threat of German invasion of the Netherlands (Reuters, 9th).</p>
<h3>A Secret History Amidst the European War</h3>
<p>London – The court today opened the trial of Princess Hohenlohe's lawsuit against Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, for breach of contract and seeking compensation. The plaintiff's lawyer, Beth, stated that the purpose of the lawsuit was to restore the princess's reputation and expose the false defamatory news published in French, German, and Austrian newspapers. The princess first met Lord Rothermere in social circles thirteen years ago. One day, she suggested to the Lord that he should start a campaign to inform the British public of the suffering Hungary had endured. The Lord approved. In July 1927, the Daily Mail published an article entitled "The Position of Hungary." After the publication of this article, Hungary welcomed it, calling the Lord "the Father of Hungary." In Budapest and other cities, many major roads or parks were named "Rothermere." In 1932, the Lord proposed that the princess should serve as his personal foreign political representative because she had decided to work to restore the Hohenzollern and Habsburg dynasties. The Lord then gave the princess £5,000 in British gold and expenses. Once the princess accepted this position, she became the Lord's diplomatic representative, and then corresponded with the German ex-Emperor, the ex-Crown Prince, Hitler, and the Hungarian Regent and Prime Minister. The princess had personally seen Hitler and advised the Lord not to contact him again, but when negotiating with the German ex-Crown Prince, the Lord declared to the ex-Crown Prince when he arrived in Germany that he was willing to do his best to help the German Hohenzollern imperial family restore their throne. Some time later, foreign newspapers repeatedly published news that the princess was working as a spy for the Lord. The Lord advised her to ignore it. After Hitler took office as Deputy Chancellor of Germany, the princess received a letter from the Crown Prince, stating his opinions on the political situation. In 1933, the princess, on the orders of the Lord, went to see Hitler. The following year, she received a letter from Hitler inviting the Lord to visit Berlin. During this five and a half year period, the Lord paid the princess a total of £46,000. Until the end of 1936, the princess, carrying Hitler's invitation, accompanied the Lord to Hitler's villa in Berchtesgaden to meet with Hitler. At the time of the coronation of the King of England, the princess introduced Lord to Hitler's aide, Weidemann. In January 1938, Lord sent the princess to Berlin to meet with Hitler regarding a certain Hungarian event and to discuss the issue of returning German colonies. The princess acted in accordance with this instruction, but a few months later, the Lord suddenly broke off all contact with her, without a single word, so she had no choice but to file a lawsuit. The princess then also spoke to prove the points made by the lawyer. The court scheduled to continue the trial tomorrow (Reuters, 8th).</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Continue</h3>
<p>The Finnish capital – Finance Minister Tanner is currently in Moscow, conducting negotiations with Soviet authorities. He made a statement to special correspondents from domestic newspapers this morning, stating, "Negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union have been temporarily suspended due to the 22nd anniversary of the Russian Revolution. This delegation will now request the Soviet authorities to reopen talks today" (Havas, 9th).</p>
<h3>New American Aircraft; Unwilling to Sell</h3>
<p>Washington – According to Secretary of War Woodring today, the United States' newest aircraft will not be sold to foreign countries unless we have discovered or manufactured even newer models. According to this, although the United States' Neutrality Act has become law, the American aircraft that Britain and France can obtain are certainly not the newest models (United Press, 9th).</p>
<h3>German Conspiracy in South Africa Exposed</h3>
<p>London – Official sources have issued a broadcast stating that German Nazi Party members conspired to cause unrest in the Union of South Africa in the early days of the war. Fortunately, the federal government discovered it in time and curbed it, and has obtained sufficient evidence to confirm that Nazi Party members wanted to organize a Blackshirt team in the South African state to create chaos and engage in sabotage. The official list of all Nazi Party members in various rebel groups will be published soon (Havas, 9th).</p>

<h3>Why Do Men Want to Love, Love, and Dislike Their Wives?</h3>

<p>Which cat doesn't eat meat? Which physiologically mature man doesn't want a wife? Who doesn't love a wife? However, many men often dislike their wives. What is the reason for this? A mature man with healthy sexual function, if unmarried or separated from his wife, will, like the ancestors of ancient times, pay attention to the tender forests, always passionately harboring fantasies of beautiful encounters. At this time, if a good match is made by fate, marrying a healthy and beautiful woman, or if two hearts are connected and reunited with a beloved wife, how can they not be as close as glue? Deep love, in a joyous and harmonious life, gives birth to clever children, organizes a happy family, and creates a bright future. How wonderful is life! But one point of energy, one point of career, and love are allowed! If a man has committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage and indulgence, or multiple wives, causing the sexual health of the glands that control sexual function to be exhausted, then various symptoms such as neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, kidney deficiency, and lack of offspring will be more than enough. Even if this kind of sick husband has a beautiful wife, he will inevitably be unable to be fulfilled in the life of love, or even completely unable to perform his marital duties. In this case, the man has already become bored of love! However, the wife's youth is wasted, can she not feel sad and sorrowful! In this era, there are countless women who openly form new relationships and divorce their husbands with righteous arguments! A dignified and upright man, suffering this great humiliation, what is the grief in his heart like! Therefore, a smart man must be good at maintaining his sexual health. The way to maintain it, it is indeed important to have a clear heart and few desires, and timely supplementation is also necessary. However, supplementation is not about quantity but about quality, and it is important to seek the right treatment. As for the above-mentioned symptoms, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective treatment. This agent is made from the essence of the sex glands extracted from strong animals such as apes, monkeys, and sea dogs, and produced by scientific replication, and the active ingredients are completely preserved. Therefore, the quality is precious and the effect is reliable, surpassing any similar preparations. After taking it, it can generate essence and nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood, and it is valuable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish nerves, and replenish energy. All symptoms can be cured in a short period of time. Regular use in autumn and winter will prolong life and rejuvenate. Only those with spermatorrhea must also take the holy medicine for treating spermatorrhea "Ximituo's Gujing Pills" (available in major Chinese and Western pharmacies at a fixed price of two yuan per box) to stop the leakage and achieve rapid results.</p>
<p>Patient Zheng Yiping, from Guangdong, 28 years old, had committed masturbation and nocturnal emission, and then married rashly, resulting in severe premature ejaculation and impotence, and had never had children. Recently, he has also felt weak brain, insomnia. Last month, he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After observing his symptoms, he immediately instructed him to purchase a dozen "Shengzhi Su" and three boxes of "Ximituo's Gujing Pills," so that he could take both continuously, and also applied new methods such as electrotherapy injections. For a month and a half, all the diseases have now been miraculously cured, the energy is abundant, and the love between husband and wife is becoming more intense! Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<h3>Treatment of Nocturnal Emission in Early Winter Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui</h3>
<p>Not storing essence in winter will inevitably lead to illness in spring. This is common knowledge that everyone knows. Therefore, for patients with spermatorrhea, winter is a very important juncture. It is considered the best time for treatment in early winter when the weather is not yet severely cold. Because curing spermatorrhea at this time and cultivating it for three winters will naturally result in sufficient essence and strength. The appearance of health and a rosy complexion in the coming spring is a natural result. If those with spermatorrhea neglect this opportunity and allow it to persist without treatment, or if ignorant young people continue to commit masturbation and indulgence, then the sexual nerves will inevitably become weaker day by day, and the seminal vesicle will become more and more relaxed. Some people will change from mild nocturnal emission to dangerous spermatorrhea. More people than can be counted will suffer from exhausted semen, causing brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, etc. These young people will inevitably have a sallow complexion, be thin and weak, and have a listless spirit. In early winter, they will already have cold hands and feet. Those who are students will inevitably fall behind in their studies. Those who are engaged in industry and commerce will also have difficulty being competent. When they want to fall in love, because of their unattractive appearance, they are often abandoned by women and fall into heartbreak! Even if they get married through the words of a matchmaker, it is even more difficult to have a fulfilling sexual life between husband and wife, or even completely unable to perform their marital duties. Under the wife's passionate desire, how can she not feel heartbroken and remorseful? As a result, diseases are caused, pessimism ensues, or even divorce and adultery occur, as often seen in today's social news! Young people who become weak and lose their health due to spermatorrhea become sinners in love and sinners in society, which is truly pitiful! At the same time, it is also a great humiliation for men! If you want to seek remedy, you can only cure the spermatorrhea at this time. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Ximi Late's Gujing Pills" is the most effective treatment. This medicine consolidates the seminal vesicle, calms the nerves, and has the special effects of promoting sleep and stopping spermatorrhea the night after taking it. However, those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms must also take the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and continue to take it, which will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time and make the body healthier. Patients who can personally come to this clinic to apply electrotherapy injections and other methods can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>
<h3>Beauty How to Make the Breasts Plump and High?</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>A pair of high breasts, set against a graceful figure, plump hips, and a fair and rosy face, along with willow eyebrows, cherry lips, pearly teeth, and a delicate nose, such a healthy and beautiful woman is not only respected as a goddess by her husband in the family. Between the two sexes, affection is especially strong. Even when she goes out to socialize, with her good looks, she is welcomed everywhere like a "star surrounded by the moon."</p>
<p>However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in society. The only main reason is that women rely entirely on the full and sound function of the ovaries to achieve the above-mentioned health and beauty. If the ovarian function is sound, then the characteristics of women, that is, there is good development, the most obvious. It is that the breasts are firm and elastic, and even if they wear tight clothes, they refuse to conform and protrude so much in front of the chest, with the two peaks facing each other and a deep valley, how captivating this is. At the same time, the hips must also be quite developed, plus a lively willow waist, which forms the most mysterious and lovely full curves of women. However, only well-developed women can enjoy these. Others who have indulged in masturbation in their early years, or who have irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, weakness after illness, resulting in unsound ovarian function and affecting metabolism, even the originally high breasts will gradually wither away, beauty will be lost, and the complexion will become haggard. Such women are not only disliked by men and have no happiness, but also in terms of their personal temperament, they are often narrow-minded, stubborn, melancholy, and sentimental. The god of happiness has no connection with her. Therefore, the tragic fate of her future is also unimaginable! If you want to seek remedy, you can only rely on science. According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologists Constan and others, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective treatment. Therefore, this medicine can nourish ovarian function and promote metabolism after taking it. If you continue to take it, it is guaranteed to completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, making the breasts plump and high, and transforming ugliness into beauty.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Xiamen Seize the Power of the Quarantine Station in Gulangyu, Which Has Already Been Seized by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese occupied Xiamen Island in May of last year, they immediately spied to seize power in Gulangyu. On one hand, they encouraged the Gulangyu Municipal Council police to request a salary increase. On the other hand, in the name of the Japanese consul, they demanded that the Municipal Council appoint a Japanese as Deputy Chief Inspector and hire ten Japanese and Taiwanese as detectives to specifically arrest anti-Japanese elements. At the same time, they increased the resident tax rate by one-tenth to pay for their salaries. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council refused the request. The Japanese then arrested seventeen people, including Pastor Wu Zhuokui of the tea trade, on Gulangyu Street and in refugee camps, accusing them of being anti-Japanese elements and executing them. The Municipal Council had no choice but to agree to the Japanese request. The Japanese then sent Daicang Zhike as Deputy Chief Inspector, bringing with him more than ten Japanese and Taiwanese detectives to Gulangyu to handle inspections and arrests. They also attacked the Mixed Court and the Municipal Council in Xiamen newspapers in an attempt to seize power. After the assassination of Hong Lixun, the president of the puppet Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, on Gulangyu, the Japanese immediately sent marines to land, guarding all intersections, conducting inspections, and cutting off transportation at the docks. Subsequently, Britain, France, and the United States also dispatched warships to Xiamen and sent marines to land to maintain order. The Japanese then put forward conditions, demanding that the consular corps allow the puppet Xiamen Maintenance Committee to fill the vacancies of the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council. The consular corps insisted on refusing. Knowing that it was difficult to achieve their goal, the Japanese withdrew their marines, and negotiations in Xiamen came to a standstill. When the Tianjin issue was being negotiated in Tokyo, the Japanese again advocated in Xiamen newspapers that the Gulangyu issue should also be included in the negotiations. The consular corps still ignored them, and the matter was dropped. When the Danzig issue arose, the Japanese believed that the time had come and again advocated in newspapers the occupation of the Mixed Court and the reorganization of the Municipal Council. After the outbreak of the European war, the Japanese believed that Britain and France's policies towards the Far East had become weak. They immediately forced the reorganization of the Municipal Council's Board of Directors and demanded that the consular corps change the administrative power of Gulangyu. The consular corps convened a meeting to discuss this. The Japanese consul put forward the following conditions: (1) The vacancies of the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council should be filled by personnel appointed by the puppet Xiamen Municipal Government. (2) The internal organization of the Municipal Council is not suitable for the current situation and must be reorganized. (3) The Municipal Council should employ Japanese staff as much as possible. (4) The agencies of the National Government on Gulangyu should be abolished. (5) Anti-Japanese elements lurking in Gulangyu should be cleared by the Japanese side. Due to the circumstances, the consular corps and the Board of Directors had no choice but to agree. The Japanese then took over the Gulangyu Chamber of Commerce and the seaport quarantine station in Xiamen a few days ago as a test of the implementation of various conditions. Currently, there is no resistance from any side, and soon the Japanese will definitely take the next step.</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops in Nantong Pay Attention to Military-Civilian Cooperation and Send Chen to Give Lectures to the Public</h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: Commander Sun of the Security Brigade believes that the people of Tong, Ru, and Hai counties have not thoroughly understood the meaning of the war of resistance, resulting in a lack of close cooperation between the military and the civilians, which has a significant impact on the future of the war of resistance. Therefore, he specially appointed Secretary Wang Zhiping as a political guidance specialist to go to various counties to convene the people to lecture on the significance of the war of resistance, the responsibilities that the people should bear, and to painfully recount the failures of the Japanese invasion of China. He also advocated strengthening the general mobilization of the people, and distributed various propaganda books and newspapers and organized drama propaganda teams to enlighten the people with new knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Puppet County Government of Kunshan Regularly Forcibly Collects Land Taxes, Causing Great Suffering to Farmers</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Since the puppet county government of Kunshan began collecting land taxes last year, the amount collected has been very small. However, land tax revenue is the economic lifeline of the entire county. As the new grain is being harvested, the puppet county government is again working on formulating measures and streamlining collection procedures. In addition to establishing a combined tax collection office in the puppet county government, branch offices have been established in various townships such as Zhangpu, Jiaozhi, Chenmu, Xidun, Zhoushu, Bacheng, Zhengyi, Pengjian, Chajiabang, and Xiajiaqiao. It is scheduled to send a large number of personnel to the townships on the 10th to collect taxes. It has been found that although this year's autumn harvest in the county is still abundant, the instability in various rural areas has prevented farmers from plowing and cultivating in a timely manner during the farming season, resulting in a harvest this year that is inferior to the past. Now that the puppet county government is collecting land taxes again, the general farmers will suffer unspeakable hardships.</p>

<h3>The Youth Played by the Relief in Lingdong - Chaoshan Students Are Distributed to Meixian and Other Places to Study - Overseas Chinese Donate Scholarships and Teachers Take Classes During the Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>(Shantou Correspondence) At the beginning of the fall of Chaoshan, all primary and secondary schools, cultural organizations, and institutions in various places were completely shut down. Unwilling to be oppressed by the Japanese army, the out-of-school youth scattered to the counties in the upper reaches of the Han River and the Dong River, wandering around with no way out. Some joined the war of resistance camp and were temporarily taken in by the military, political, and party agencies. The county administration training institute and the Baojia chief training institute, etc., opened by the Guangdong Provincial Government in Shao, can only accommodate the smallest number of young people. It has been found that the Chaoshan area has a population of more than five million, and there are four to five hundred thousand promising young people who need to be guided and utilized.</p>
<p>He Chunfan, the administrative commissioner of the Fifth District, went to Shaoguan in early October to report on his work and returned to Jieyang on the 18th. It is reported that he has obtained the approval of the provincial government to add five temporary middle schools in the mountains of Fengshun, Puning, and Jieyang, which will be presided over by military, political, and party agencies. Five hundred young people will be selected from among the middle school students to serve as cadres, who will be given six months of short-term training and then sent to various counties to be responsible for propaganda and organizing the masses. The living expenses of all staff members will be increased and improved as much as possible, with each person receiving 30 yuan of activity expenses per month to promote the efficiency of various tasks. There were originally 40 middle schools of various levels in Chaoshan. The establishment of temporary middle schools now is indeed a necessary move for the present. A large number of young students from Chaoshan have fled alone to Meixian, Xingning, and Pingyuan counties because they are unwilling to be obedient people and are willing to live their wandering and miserable lives. Wu Junshu and other eight male and female students from Shantou Municipal First Middle School fled to Mei and requested relief from Xiong Dansun, the secretary of the county party headquarters. The relief committee allocated funds, giving each person four yuan first, and then introducing male students Wu Shujun, Wu Binquan, Qiu Yusong, Chen Haofeng, and Huang Shaofeng to Meizhou Middle School to study for free. Female students Wang Ruozhen, Wu Shuzheng, and Chen Fengxian went to the Women's Normal School to study, and the relief committee first paid 32 yuan for the students' food expenses. Ji Xinrong and other four elementary school students from Chenghai who arrived later were sent to Pingyuan County Temporary Middle School to study. It has been found that all village schools in the Mei area will not have holidays this summer because there are so many new students who have moved in to study. During the summer vacation, all teachers and staff are doing their duty. Some enthusiastic overseas Chinese (such as Mr. Li Wenfang of Xinan Creek, Songkou) are willing to donate 100 or more scholarships. For schools with excellent performance, enthusiastic overseas Chinese are willing to donate tuition fees to allow general out-of-school students to enter schools for free. In addition to focusing on teaching and cultivating young people, many teachers from various schools have also joined the army, such as Lin Lingfeng of Pengfei School in Xiyang, Meixian, Li Rongmao of Wanshan School, and other teachers from other schools, such as Li Dongbi, Zhong Yingming, Qiu Tiangui, Tang Rensheng, and others, more than a hundred people, are willing to give up their chalk career and go to apply for cadre positions in the security office. Therefore, the recovery of the lost land of Chaoshan and the revitalization of the Republic of China is just around the corner (October 21st) (Xi)</p>
<h3>Shanghai - A Glimpse of Talent Supply and Demand Two Years After the War (1)</h3>
<p>— Pan Wenan, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie</p>
<p>In the year after the August 13th Incident, a report was prepared based on the statistical materials of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center for that year (from July 26th to the end of June 27th), which roughly showed the supply and demand of talents in Shanghai after the war. Compared with before the war, it was even more serious, and the need for adjustments in all aspects of society was even more urgent. Before we knew it, two years had passed since the war. What changes have taken place in the supply and demand of talents? Are there any improvements compared with the actual situation before the war and in the first year after the war? It seems necessary to conduct another review. The statistical materials are still based on those of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center (from July 27th to the end of June 28th). Although it cannot represent the entire situation in Shanghai, because this organization is public and does not charge fees, and it has considerable contact with all aspects, the results obtained can also represent the general supply and demand of talents in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Supply of Talent</p>
<p>By finding out what kind of people are seeking employment, we can get a general idea of the current situation of the unemployed. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, there were a total of 2,346 people who registered for jobs last year, which is higher than the number before the war and in the first year after the war, with an average increase of 14 percent. It is conceivable that the number of unemployed people has increased due to the continuation of the war. Of the 2,346 job seekers, if we analyze them by gender, 1,926 are men, accounting for 82.1% of the total number, and 420 are women, accounting for 17.9%. Compared with the number in the first year after the war, the number of men has increased, while the number of women has gradually decreased, but it is still higher than before the war. It is feared that women will still come out to struggle and shoulder the burden of life with men as before. Gender distribution of job seekers (Table 1)</p>
<h3>Assessment of the Service Corps of Primary and Secondary School Teachers in the War Zone</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Service Corps of Primary and Secondary School Teachers in the War Zone have been established one after another, with a total of nine corps. In addition to the members of each corps, the Ministry of Education also appointed a number of inspectors to participate in the work, and each corps established a director of inspection to preside over its affairs. In mid-October, the Ministry of Education issued instructions to the directors of inspection of each service corps, requiring them to strictly supervise and guide the work of each inspector, and pointed out that the task of each inspector is to inspect and assist the work of each member of the corps. Each director should carefully examine whether each inspector is competent for the assigned task, assess the merits and demerits of their work performance, and report them quickly for rewards and punishments.</p>

<h3>Finance - Foreign Exchange Tightened Sharply Followed by a Large Relaxation - British Gold at Five Shillings and American Exchange at Eight Yuan - Both Once Broke In But Eventually Returned</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the HSBC announced exchange rates opening with a decrease of 25 in the British exchange rate, calculated at four shillings and seventy-five pence, and a decrease of 0.05625 in the American exchange rate, at seven yuan and sixty-eight and seventy-five fen. Other exchanges also decreased uniformly. The black market for British and American exchanges was still in a state of confusion, with sudden ups and downs in the middle, and the market was particularly uneasy. British gold was once forced below the five-shilling mark, and the American exchange rate also fell below the eight-yuan mark. The main buyers should be the Chinese merchants who were eager to turn from short to long and aggressively buy, as well as the Hong Kong merchants who changed their style and searched for goods. Moreover, most of the suppliers took the opportunity to raise prices, so the positions became tight and continued to tighten. The morning opening showed a tight British and American exchange rate because the American and British exchange rates decreased by another three fen, but soon the Chinese merchants took the lead in buying. Unexpectedly, HSBC had buying intentions. Before a moment had passed, the British gold had weakened directly to five shillings. Although exporters and Japanese and American banks came to the market to release their positions, the Hong Kong Electric and Youli suddenly seized the opportunity to drag in, so the positions were still unbalanced in supply and demand, and they broke through the five-shilling mark for British gold and the eight-yuan mark for American exchange. Although it eased slightly later, the market became tight again as the Chinese merchants bought heavily. The weakest British gold was once quoted at four shillings and eighty-seven and five pence, and the American exchange rate also reached seven yuan and eighty-seven and five fen. Fortunately, HSBC soon returned some positions, and the American and Japanese banks still had selling intentions, and the buyers also gradually thinned out. By noon, the British gold had returned to four shillings and ninety-six and eighty-five pence, and the American exchange rate had also relaxed to eight yuan and zero six two five fen. In the afternoon, the situation changed drastically, and the Chinese and Hong Kong merchants changed from buying to selling, gradually trending harder, reaching five shillings and twelve and five pence, and the American exchange rate also exceeded eight yuan and thirty-seven and five fen. Later, Youli's appetite was very strong, and it was once again tight to five shillings and eight yuan and twelve and five fen. At the close of the market, the British gold was still slightly relaxed to five shillings and zero six two five pence, and the American exchange rate was eight yuan and twenty-one and eighty-five fen. As a result, the British tightend by 0.03125, and the American weakened by 0.09375. The futures situation was similar to the spot market, and trading was still brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>HSBC's Listed Exchange Rates Shrunk Yesterday</p>
<p>In the early morning, the long-term interest rate for London's large bonds increased by 0.0625 and the forward rate increased by 0.125. New York's silver price remained unchanged. London's raw gold remained unchanged. In terms of exchange rates, the British exchange rate against the American exchange rate and the French exchange rate remained unchanged, while the exchange rate against Shanghai decreased by 0.375. The American exchange rate against the British exchange rate decreased by 0.03, the exchange rate against Shanghai decreased by 0.55, and the exchange rate against the French exchange rate decreased slightly by 0.02. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. In the morning opening, the bank's selling price for spot goods was five shillings and zero nine three seven five pence for British gold and eight yuan and two eight one two five fen for American exchange, which was unchanged for British gold and tight for American exchange by 0.03125 compared to the previous closing, which was due to the decrease in exchange rates. After the opening, the market trend became tight and soft because speculators continued to aggressively buy and HSBC had no supply intention, but instead had buying appetite. British gold weakened immediately to five shillings, and then Hong Kong Electric and Youli also came to buy in. However, at that time, exporters and Japanese and American banks lowered prices and released positions slightly. British gold for spot goods tightened from five shillings to four shillings and nine zero six two five pence, and the American exchange rate also softened from eight yuan and one two five fen to seven yuan and nine three seven five fen. The HSBC announced exchange rates opened with a decrease of 0.025 in the British exchange rate and a decrease of 0.05625 in the American exchange rate. The silver balance tax opened with a large increase of 0.25. After that, the American Bank of China and the Japanese Bank of Zhengjin had slightly more selling intentions, so the market trend turned around once. It is estimated that the foreign currency spot British gold at four shillings and nine three seven five pence and the spot American exchange at eight yuan were released to Hong Kong Electric Chinese merchants and foreign banks. However, at that time, Chinese merchants came to cover short positions on a large scale, so the situation trend became tight and soft again. It is estimated that Chinese merchants covered short positions in spot British gold at four shillings and nine three seven five pence of Datong Youli a certain bank, as well as British gold at four shillings and nine three seven five and eight seven five pence of this month and American exchange at seven yuan and nine three seven five and eight one two five fen of this month. Later, Hong Kong Electric Youli also settled foreign currency spot British gold at four shillings and eight seven five pence of HSBC and other foreign banks, as well as spot American exchange at seven yuan and eight seven five fen. Because the number of buyers gradually decreased, and American and Japanese banks continued to release positions, the market trend was seen to recover. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's selling price for spot goods was four shillings and nine six eight seven five pence for British gold and eight yuan and zero six one five fen for American exchange, which tightened British gold by 0.125 and softened American exchange by 0.12875 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>British and American Were Still Seen As Tight at the Close</p>
<p>At the beginning of the afternoon, the situation continued to recover because Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to throw out positions, and at the same time, the long positions of Chinese merchants were also closed. It is estimated that the spot British gold was sold to foreign banks from five shillings and zero three one two five to one two five, and the spot American exchange was from eight yuan and one eight seven five to three two five. Later, the hardest British gold was five shillings and one two five, and the bank was willing to release positions. The bank's buying price for American exchange was once quoted at over eight yuan and three seven five. Because Youli came to aggressively buy again, British gold was once again tight to five shillings and American exchange was eight yuan and one two five fen. After entering the market, the long positions of Chinese merchants came out again, so it was reported again to recover. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's selling price for spot goods was five shillings and zero six two five pence for British gold and eight yuan and one two eight seven five fen for American exchange, 5,046,875 pence for British gold for this month, and 8.1875 yuan for American exchange. As a result, spot and futures increased by 0.0325 for British gold compared to the previous day and decreased by 0.09375 for American exchange.</p>

<p>Tianjin American Exchange Shrunk by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Tianjin, 9th telegram, the exchange market opened this morning, and the British and American exchange rates tightened sharply. The British exchange rate for spot goods decreased by 0.025 to 5 pence, and the American exchange rate for spot goods decreased by half a yuan to 8.125 yuan.

<h3>American Gold Notes Arrived - Twelve Yuan and Eight Jiao and a Half</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was uncertain. Initially, it continued the tightening trend of the previous day, and the demand for British and American gold pounds was very high. The market was strong, and the absorption of British and American gold notes was even smoother. The American gold notes increased to 12 yuan and eight jiao and a half, but the increase was too high, which led to profit-taking supplies. At noon, it dropped back to 12 yuan and two jiao. In the afternoon, the supply continued to be strong, and the evening market was 12 yuan and one jiao. The supply of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dutch notes was not smooth, and the market was still strong. The demand for Annam notes was very weak, and the Japanese gold notes were slightly stronger. The evening market was 1 yuan and three jiao and five li. The supply of Korean notes was not strong, and it continued to be expensive. The evening market was 1 yuan and one jiao and two fen. Yesterday's market price, the American gold notes decreased by 0.15, the Hong Kong notes increased by 0.03, the Singapore notes and the Dutch notes both increased by 0.3, the Annam notes decreased by 0.05, and the other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Gold Market's Wild Rise and Fall: Peak at 3,850 Yuan, Hong Kong Investors Remain Major Patrons</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market saw intense volatility due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, leading to significant price swings. Generally, the market initially rose before declining, with a difference of as much as 180 yuan between the highest and lowest prices. At the opening, the tight foreign exchange market fueled speculative buying, causing an immediate jump of 130 yuan to 3,800 yuan. Continued large purchases by Hong Kong investors pushed the price up another 50 yuan. However, this upward trend was short-lived. As foreign exchange rates slightly stabilized, money changers and securities firms suddenly began selling, causing an immediate drop to 3,755 yuan. Shortly thereafter, some money changers resumed buying, and as exchange rates tightened again, the price climbed back up to 3,825 yuan. However, as the noon hour approached, the foreign exchange market strengthened again, and rumors of the unlikelihood of peace in Europe led gold firms to take profits, resulting in a more significant decline. By the afternoon, the price had fallen to 3,670 yuan. Later, with continued tightness in the foreign exchange market, Hong Kong investors and day traders actively closed their positions, causing a surge of 90 yuan. Ultimately, the continued strength in foreign exchange rates led to a closing price of 3,730 yuan, up 60 yuan from the previous day's noon closing. Compared to the after-hours trading price of the previous day, this was also an increase of about 30 yuan. Trading volume remained high throughout the day, estimated at around 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry retailers ultimately raised their prices by 5 yuan, while customs gold prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises Another 60 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) carried the momentum from the previous day, and with reports of a sudden tightening in foreign exchange rates, brokers were eager to buy, driving up prices. By 9:10 AM, trading had begun, with the price jumping 130 yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing. A jewelry store bought 30 taels of gold for 3,800 yuan. Continuing shrinkage of foreign exchange and aggressive buying by a jewelry store on behalf of Hong Kong interests pushed the price up another 50 yuan. A money changer traded 20 taels for 3,850 yuan. As foreign exchange rates suddenly rebounded, selling pressure increased, with money changers and securities firms rushing to sell. The price soon fell by 80 yuan, with a securities firm selling 50 taels to a gold firm for 3,770 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange rates tightened again, buying interest revived, with a money changer buying on behalf of a client and another securities firm also actively absorbing supply. Although some gold firms took the opportunity to profit, their positions were still insufficient to meet demand, causing another rise of 55 yuan. The securities firm bought 30 taels from a jewelry store for 3,825 yuan. Subsequently, with foreign exchange rates strengthening again, money changers and jewelry stores rushed to sell, causing a decline. Soon, the price plummeted 90 yuan, with a securities firm selling 20 taels to a gold firm for 3,735 yuan. At noon, a gold firm made a small purchase, pulling the price up 10 yuan. A money changer sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 3,745 yuan, marking the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to the strengthening of foreign exchange rates, money changers and a certain "Yu" firm aggressively sold, and with buyers on the sidelines, the market opened with a sharp drop of 55 yuan. A money changer sold 10 taels to a gold firm for 3,690 yuan. Later, a securities firm and a jewelry store (acting on behalf of Hong Kong interests) took advantage of the low prices to buy aggressively, causing an immediate rebound of 40 yuan. A securities firm traded 10 taels internally for 3,730 yuan. As foreign exchange rates continued to weaken, selling pressure returned, with jewelry stores frequently selling off. Simultaneously, some securities firms and individual speculators were eager to sell, causing a further decline below the 3,700 yuan mark. A money changer sold 20 taels to a jewelry store for 3,670 yuan. Subsequently, as foreign exchange rates suddenly tightened again, coupled with aggressive short covering by a gold firm and a money changer, and further buying by Hong Kong investors and securities firms, the price surged 90 yuan. A money changer bought 50 taels from a gold firm for 3,760 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange rates rebounded again, the price declined accordingly, soon falling by 45 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a gold firm for 3,715 yuan. Subsequently, a money changer stepped in to lift the price, causing a rise of 15 yuan. The money changer bought 20 taels from a gold firm for 3,730 yuan, marking the evening closing price. As a result, the price was up 60 yuan from the previous day's noon closing, and also about 30 yuan higher than the after-hours trading price of the previous day. With a total fluctuation of 180 yuan throughout the day, the cash gold firms were selling spot gold at a premium of 10 yuan over spot gold, while buying it back at a discount of over 20 yuan. Margined gold was trading at a discount of about 50 yuan to the listed price, with very little trading activity.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry at 380 Yuan</p>
<p>The retail price of gold jewelry was initially 375 yuan per tael at major retailers. At 9:35 AM, the price increased by 10 yuan, then decreased by 5 yuan at 12:05 PM. At 2:15 PM, it fell another 5 yuan, and at 2:55 PM, it rose again by 5 yuan. Ultimately, major retailers revised the price to 380 yuan, with new retailers offering the same price. Buy-back prices were lowered by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Shares Most Popular, Domestic Bonds Recover</h3>
<p>The securities grey market saw significant fluctuations yesterday. Short sellers exerted strong downward pressure, hoping to shake the market's uncertain sentiment. However, their efforts proved insufficient, leading to short covering. Although market sentiment was weak, it had not reached a state of panic. Most investors still held the view of "buying low, selling high," which was not appropriate in the current environment. Therefore, most of the short positions were temporary in nature, and any turnaround in the situation would trigger a significant rebound. Short sellers were also paying close attention. Initially, at the opening yesterday morning, Jiufeng opened with Class C shares at 45.70 yuan, a sharp drop of more than one yuan compared to the previous day. Despite the strong downward pressure, there was no sustained selling, allowing short sellers to cover their positions. Tiansheng, Dafeng, Shengda, and others were actively buying, causing the market price to rise above the previous day's closing price. Simultaneously, Runli and Runheng continued to sell, but the market price did not weaken. In the afternoon, the market price saw little change due to balanced buying and selling, similar to the morning. Although the morning saw significant fluctuations, the overall result for the day was a slight increase of 0.10 to 0.40 yuan, with only Class D shares down 0.10 yuan. The total value of transactions was approximately 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 20 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company stock were traded at a price of 29 yuan and 5 jiao each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce experienced many changes due to the fluctuating foreign exchange trends. The market opened weak but gradually improved. When trading began in the afternoon, the market became firm and lively again, as new accounts entered the market. However, this positive trend was short-lived. Profit-taking investors took the opportunity to sell, leading to a market decline. Fortunately, whenever stocks fell slightly, buyers stepped in to support the market, preventing a significant decline. Stocks that were previously unpopular became market favorites, and there was a slight increase in interest in rubber stocks, leading to significant trading volume.</p>
<p>London, 8th: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds have stabilized, and there have been no changes in the prices of various bonds. London, 8th: Today, the listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks have softened slightly. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares have fallen by half a pound to 85 pounds. Kulak-Lim rubber stocks have fallen by 8 pence to 19 shillings and 4 pence. Other stocks remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: White Cotton Transactions Strong, US Cotton Estimates Reduced Again</h3>
<p>Cotton trading is gradually developing. However, selling prices are similar to those of the previous day. This is due to the recent decrease in the exchange rate of drafts and the increase in yarn prices by 20 to 30 yuan. At the same time, some yarn factories have released several thousand bales of yarn and slightly replenished their raw cotton to hedge. However, this is limited to transactions of white cotton. Japanese-owned Shanghai factories purchased 1,000 bales each of Tongzhou Fire Machine Cotton, all flood-delivered bales for factory value. Trading among industry peers is also active due to the stimulation of draft exchange rates. Therefore, trading to settle positions is also lively. Looking ahead, if the foreign exchange rate remains stable, there may be hope for improvement. From Northern Jiangsu, 1,449 bales of Tong cotton, 898 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 1,150 bales of Beisha cotton were delivered. The current cotton situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Washington: The US Department of Agriculture has released its fifth cotton production estimate of 11,845,000 bales, a decrease of 83,000 bales from the previous estimate of 11,928,000 bales.</p>
<p>Another report: Cotton trading in Shanghai has been relatively quiet due to the fluctuating exchange rates. However, factories remain active. Shenxin Factory released more than 4,000 bales of cotton yarn the day before yesterday, so it replenished more than 1,000 bales of American cotton yesterday. Industry peers are currently taking a wait-and-see approach, but their purchasing intentions remain very strong. Japanese factories have been relatively quiet regarding foreign cotton purchases, presumably because their needs have already been met.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was very active in the morning. Overseas cotton merchants were aggressively buying in the market. At the same time, the government has also announced a new loan program for new cotton in the future, which has stimulated buying interest and short covering. Closing prices were more than 10 points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton fell by 3 to 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by more than 10 points, and Liverpool cotton fell by more than 4 pence.</p>
<h3>Speculators Take the Opportunity to Push Prices Up, Yarn Market Rises Again, "Double Horse" and "Flying Lady" Each Jump About 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the upward trend is very strong, mostly driven by enthusiastic speculation. Everyone is talking about the shrinking exchange rates and looking forward to rising prices, but actual demand remains very low. Therefore, apart from the "Double Horse" brand being a speculative target, other yarn markets are still firm but soft. The fundamental problem is that the foundation needs to be supported by actual sales, then it can be consolidated. However, at present, everyone is using exchange rate fluctuations as a tool. Although sales are narrow, it does not cause problems in the market.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning carrying the momentum of the previous day, and industry peers were active again. Many said that the exchange rate was expected to shrink, and the number of buyers increased. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 650 yuan, up 10 yuan, but Guangzhou buyers were not very active. General operators used foreign exchange as a tool, and their enthusiasm for buying increased again. The market price rose step by step to 660 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day were only 920 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan, Flying Lady rose by 17.5 yuan, and Double Globe rose by 19 yuan. Hongzhang Factory released 70 bales of 10-count Baoyi at a price of 505 yuan. Yesterday, there were 624 pieces in Hong Kong. The amount of each buyer is listed below.</p>
<h3>Food: Tight Control by Speculators Prevents Price Decline, Wuhu Indica Rice Available for Purchase and Transport, Refined Rice Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's heavy rain meant that only 2,000 to 3,000 packages of rice arrived from Sujia Kuntai Fengjia Qing Si, making the already weak market tighter. Since the decline from the previous peak, most owners of goods acquired at higher prices were unwilling to sell cheaply. This made the goods on the market even scarcer. At the same time, speculators seized on this weakness, aiming to buy at low prices and inquiring about prices. They focused on sourcing high-quality Jiangbei rice, and the limited supply on the market was quickly exhausted. When speculators were unable to acquire Jiangbei rice, they turned to Jingwu rice, but the supply was also limited. As a result, the market rose steadily, with the closing price of Jiangbei rice at 23.5 yuan, settled at 23 yuan; Jingwu rice at 23.7 yuan, settled at 22.5 yuan. Other types of rice, such as new refined rice and Tea Kiln variety, were active in the morning, and local shops were also buying. However, as speculators sold off at high prices, the market was flooded, and the market softened and sales became slow. As a result, the market only stabilized, without any significant gains or losses. As the supply of Luyang high-quality rice was limited and the existing stocks were weak, and it was also very popular with shops, the market was extremely firm. Therefore, once there was activity, the market immediately rose. Yesterday's trading volume was very high, with prices increasing by 4 to 5 jiao. The situation remains tight, and there are also signs of a slight recovery.</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, Ke Xian rice prices had retreated, prompting Ke merchants and miscellaneous stores to add to their inventories. Sources from various regions remained scarce, and Japanese firms lacked complete sales. Merchants and speculators took the opportunity to quote higher prices, and Ke Xian rice prices rose to 23.8 yuan, a steep increase of half a yuan compared to the previous market. However, in the afternoon, merchants offered Wan Xian rice for future delivery, which began to stabilize market sentiment. However, the Jiangbei merchants have begun trial transport of Wuhu rice, and there are rumors that it will arrive soon. Also, the current Xian rice price is gradually approaching the price of Jing rice, and so industry insiders are expecting the market may stabilize.</p>
<p>According to reports, high-quality Jiangbei Xian rice is worth 20.05 yuan in Shanghai, and mass-market goods are worth around 20 yuan. Merchants in Shanghai are still afraid to transport rice due to previous losses, while local merchants in Jiangbei have already transported small batches of dozens or hundreds of bags. Early shipments could have arrived in Shanghai, but were intercepted and sold in Chongtong area due to rice shortages.</p>
<p>Wuhu Xian rice has traditionally been monopolized by the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. Recently, due to requests from smaller Japanese trading companies to the Asian Development Board to open it up, several batches of transport permits have been issued to small trading companies since November 1. Small trading companies, due to their own weakness, often cooperate with Chinese merchants, or sell the transport fee to merchants at a fee of 2 yuan to 3.5 yuan per bag. Therefore, Wuhu rice may arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Prices Reduced by 1 Jiao, Wheat Market Stalls with No Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour mill's price for flour fell by 1 jiao, with the official price of No. 2 flour changing to 7.3 yuan in cash. However, sales remained normal. This is because the Yangtze River area is currently flooded with flour from the mainland, and shipments are also arriving in Shanghai, which is having an impact on the market. It is said that the price of Cannon Car flour must still be 4 jiao, while sales to both northern and southern customers are sporadic. The local market is only meeting daily needs. Returns have seen a gradual easing in the market, but there is no formal market, and total transactions are only 30,000 packages.</p>
<p>There were 4,000 to 5,000 packages of wheat, and the goods that arrived were prepared to be stored in warehouses and were unwilling to be put on display. This is because the price of flour is trending downwards, and the raw materials are naturally affected. However, the sellers are holding on to their goods and unwilling to sell because of the high cost. As a result, factories and customers have not formally agreed on any transactions.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Oil Prices Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's peanut oil market saw a sudden tense situation. The foreign exchange grey market weakened sharply, Hong Kong buyers were actively buying, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a surge of more than 3 yuan. A total of 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 57 yuan, 100 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil at a price of 73 yuan, 1,000 cans of Yantai canned oil at a price of 73 yuan, and 400 cans of Jiangbei canned oil at a price of 74 yuan. Soybean oil was potentially weak. Although Kobe and Dalian barrel oil were tightly held and not opened, the selling price of bagged oil loosened, slightly lower than the previous day's market by 2 jiao. 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 48.4 yuan, and 100 cans of Yantai canned oil at a price of 66.5 yuan.</p>
<p>According to news from Xiangtianxiang Trading Company, the price of Dutch white sugar was 7.18 Dutch guilders, an increase of 0.08, and the Dutch exchange rate shrank by 375. Therefore, the association's price continued to rise. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was about 53 yuan, the price of goods in outside warehouses was 53.8 yuan to 53.3 yuan, the price of Taikoo car white sugar increased by half, the price of West Warehouse B was 57 yuan, and the price of East Warehouse B was 57 yuan. The price was determined by tax refund. There were bids for red Dutch sugar and red road sugar, but no transactions. The price of No. 1 fine white sugar was 53.5 yuan, No. 2 was 53 yuan, No. 3 was 52.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 52 yuan. The trend of domestic sugar remained flat and soft, with only bids and no transactions.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Shima Dried Longans More Expensive Than Usual</h3>
<p>Due to the extreme shortage of Shima sun-dried longans and the rising prices at the origin, the market has suddenly become tight. Only two boxes arrived recently, and it is said that the price has increased by nearly 10 yuan compared to the initial price. Compared to the low price in early summer, the increase is more than two-thirds.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Market Trading Not Prosperous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market strengthened, and yarn and thread prices rose across the board. Cloth prices also turned firm after falling, and bids increased slightly. However, actual sales were sluggish, and the market had excessive inventory. Therefore, the market atmosphere was still loose, and many were trying to sell. Most buyers were taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the buying and selling atmosphere in the market was not strong. White goods, coarse cloth, and printed satin were selling well. Buyers from Zhejiang and Wenzhou-Ningbo purchased nearly 200 packages of coarse cloth and 50 to 60 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and colored twill. Buyers from Fujian and Guangdong purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and serge. Local buyers purchased 100-odd pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, printed and bleached cloth. Overseas buyers from Mumbai and other places added 5,000-odd pieces of printed satin and other goods. Hong Kong buyers purchased 100-odd pieces of fine twill, satin, grey cloth, and fine cloth.</p>
<p>The morning market for Dongpi white goods and fine cloth was strong. The high price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached 18.75 yuan per piece. As actual sales flattened, the market began to loosen. Dong Cotton offered spot Dragon Head fine cloth for only 18.5 yuan, and Blue Double Fish fine twill for 17.1 yuan. Therefore, the market atmosphere turned downward in the afternoon, and bids for fine cloth fell to 18.6 yuan. The morning price of Four Gentlemen serge reached 6 jiao 2 fen 2 li and a half per yard, but then fell to 6 jiao 0 fen 7 li and a half to 1 fen. Throughout the day, local traders traded 500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill.</p>

<h3>Chongqing is Full of Optimism, China is Determined to Fight a Protracted War, Wartime Capital Shows Active Posture, People's Belief in Victory is Exceptionally Strong, Reflections of the Associated Press Far East General Manager on Visiting Chongqing</h3>
<p>Mr. Maurice, Far East General Manager of the Associated Press of America, has just returned to Shanghai after touring China's wartime capital. According to him, "Based on the strength of China's political institutions, capable of supporting a protracted war, and the continuous training of countless troops, continuously sent to the front lines to provide reinforcements and achieving great feats, Chongqing is full of optimism. This belief is clearly demonstrated in any location in the city, from official proclamations to countless construction workers, with a determination to succeed naturally revealed in their words.</p>
<p>China Shows No Signs of Weakness</p>
<p>For this reason, I am very surprised that former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's remarks to me were misunderstood as indicating some signs of weakness in the Chinese government. Dr. Wang, in response to my inquiries, spoke of mediation and peace, leading one to imagine that the war might be coming to an end. However, to interpret this answer as a sign of China's weakness is a great mistake. The distance between this and the truth is as far as Chongqing is from Tokyo, or perhaps even farther." In Chongqing, in addition to his famous interview with Foreign Minister Wang, Mr. Maurice also met with Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General of the National Defense Supreme Council Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the War Zone Party and Government Committee Shao Lizi, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone General Li Zongren, and had long conversations with Minister of Propaganda Ye Chucang, Deputy Minister Dong Xianguang, and President of the Central News Agency Xiao Tongzi.</p>
<p>US-Japan Conflict Almost Inevitable</p>
<p>Mr. Maurice continued, "The leaders I met were quite satisfied with the trend of the international situation and were very pleased with the recent tough attitude taken by the United States towards Japan. They pointed out that Japan's ambitious actions inevitably lead to conflict with the United States on many points. In addition, my personal observation has proved that Sichuan Province's abundance of natural resources is not an exaggeration. This is the land of plenty, allowing anyone to live comfortably relying on geographical advantages.</p>
<p>Transport System Gradually Improving</p>
<p>The transportation industry in the Chinese mainland is constantly improving and progressing steadily. However, the transportation cost from Kunming to Chongqing remains high. Therefore, any foreign goods are considered a luxury consumption in Chongqing. However, according to the expectations of American transportation consulting experts, after the establishment of a new transportation system, passenger and freight water rates will immediately decrease. This new transportation system is moving forward.</p>
<p>Chongqing Construction Rapidly Developing</p>
<p>The construction of Chongqing is progressing rapidly, similar to the two sides of the land being pushed forward. The above-ground construction covers a wide area, and the underground air-raid shelters are also being excavated extensively. The roar sounds from fast places from time to time, as if the artillery is roaring, but is actually the sound of exploding rock caves, which are used to supplement the air-raid shelters. The flying debris and gravel are collected and used to pave the roads.</p>
<p>Air-Raid Shelters Safe and Comfortable</p>
<p>The air-raid shelters in Chongqing are now sufficient for use. Therefore, as soon as the air-raid alarm sounds, people calmly walk into the shelters to take temporary refuge. Some may carry books, some may hold canvas chairs, and read by the light of kerosene lamps or hand torches. Some may crack melon seeds in the shelters and chat with their relatives and friends. In this war, a rapidly progressing achievement should be commended as the aviation industry, which I have never seen more than this. The six-hour Chongqing-Hong Kong flight of China National Aviation Corporation now flies almost daily, and is comfortable and reliable.</p>
<h3>National Government's October Relief Funds, Telegraphic Transfer to Shanghai, Deeply Touched by Benevolence</h3>
<p>The National Government is deeply concerned about the people suffering from the disaster throughout the country, and is doing its best to provide relief. In the recent water disaster in North China, there is no discrimination due to the occupied areas. Since the August 13th Incident in Shanghai, the National Government's Relief Committee has allocated 100,000 yuan monthly. It is now known that the 100,000 yuan for October of this year has already been telegraphically transferred to Shanghai. The original telegram from the First Relief Zone of this city receiving the remittance from the Relief Committee is recorded below (above omitted). We will first apportion the telegraphic transfer of 100,000 yuan for the you month (August in the Chinese calendar) from the Four Banks, and immediately contact to receive it, separately transfer it, and first repay the loan. Relief Committee, East, Yu, National Government. At this time when the Anti-Japanese war expenses are huge, they still allocate monthly funds to benefit the refugees in Shanghai, deeply touched by the benevolence.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador, Cosme, Leaves for Chongqing Yesterday, Long Stay in Chongqing, Discussing All Issues with the Central Government</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China, Cosme, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon to visit the central authorities of China for a routine visit. The French Ambassador took the Dutch Java Company's Shiba de steamer south to Hong Kong, then took a warship to Haiphong, and met with the Governor-General of Vietnam, Catroux, for a short stay. Then, he transferred to Chongqing. The Shiba de was docked at the Lanyan Con wharf in Pudong. It was originally scheduled to depart at 2:00 PM yesterday, but was postponed to 4:00 PM due to weather conditions. When the French Ambassador took the Jianghai Customs small ship across the river to Pudong to board the ship, the French Concession Police Station and the Bund area were temporarily added with police, with strict security, and a guard of honor was deployed. Those who saw him off included French Embassy Military Counselor Yihong, Commercial Counselor, French Consul General Baudiczi, Director of the French Municipal Council Bredi, Commander of the French Defense Forces Colonel Grigny, and Polish Charge d'Affaires to China Ross. Ambassador Cosme's trip to Chongqing will have a long stay, and will discuss all issues with the central authorities in a spirit of friendship. In addition, there are rumors that US Ambassador Dr. Johnson will leave Chongqing for Shanghai. It is confirmed that Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to leave Chongqing for Hong Kong by plane on the 10th, then go to Beijing to meet his family. Ambassador Johnson will take the opportunity to come to Shanghai to meet with Commander-in-Chief of the Asian Fleet, Admiral Hurd, to discuss all issues. The date of return will be in the spring.</p>

<h3>Premier's Birthday Celebration Preparations</h3>
<p>The city is preparing to hang flags to celebrate Premier's birthday on November 12th. All schools will also be closed as usual. However, that day happens to be Sunday. Due to the current national crisis, most do not intend to make up for the holiday. The Public Concession Bureau will be closed on the 13th as usual to express congratulations to Premier Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who devoted his life to the revolution, founded the Republic of China, and his great achievements are respected by the country as the Father of the Nation. As winter is approaching and the soldiers are suffering from the cold, the city has decided to concentrate its efforts on the day of celebration to continue raising money for winter clothing to achieve the goal of doubling the donations. In addition, the city's charities are also calling on the refugees staying in Shanghai, hoping that people from all walks of life will donate winter clothing, quilts, or old clothes, children's shoes and hats, etc., so that they can survive the winter. The authorities of the two concessions, fearing that unscrupulous elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble, have started preparations for prevention and inspection to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Obstructing the Circulation of Legal Tender in Shanghai: All Nations Will Not Permit It; Shanghai's Legal Tender Supply Is Sufficient and Will Not Affect Citizens' Livelihoods</h3>
<p>The puppet "Reformed Government," in order to promote its "Huaxing Notes," through its "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" Li Jiannan, requested the consuls of various countries in Shanghai and the Jianghai Customs Commissioner Luo to prohibit the import of Chinese legal tender. Although the consuls of various countries and Commissioner Luo did not accept this request, the black market for foreign exchange and gold in Shanghai is seeing speculative elements ready to make trouble again, causing intense market fluctuations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Headed Down the Same Road As Accepting Puppet Currency</p>
<p>Although Jianghai Customs Commissioner Lordford did not accept the request of "Superintendent" Li Jiannan, and has not issued any order prohibiting the import of legal tender, due to the situation in Shanghai, there are fears that he will repeat the mistake of accepting "Huaxing Notes." Because Jianghai Customs accepted "Huaxing Notes" on September 1st of this year, Commissioner Luo did not issue any order. Therefore, the transportation of legal tender to Shanghai by the four banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—will likely be obstructed. However, since the retreat of the National Army to the west, the four banks immediately stopped transporting legal tender.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Transporting Currency to Provide Relief</p>
<p>In order to maintain a proper supply in the Shanghai market, various Allied banks in Shanghai contacted the head offices of the four banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China—to have the Allied banks transport legal tender to Shanghai for relief. For example, the American President Lines' President Pierce, which recently arrived in Shanghai, carried ten million yuan in Chinese legal tender, which belongs to the American Chase Bank. Although the "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" attempted to obstruct it, it was safely unloaded due to the foreign merchants' involvement. The various Allied banks have decided to ignore the superintendent's request and are firmly opposed to it.</p>
<p>Affecting Various Countries' Trade with China</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News learned from banking circles yesterday that the amount of legal tender circulating in the Shanghai concession area is quite large and sufficient to meet needs. Therefore, forcibly preventing legal tender from coming to Shanghai will not affect the livelihoods of citizens. As for the Chinese legal tender transported to Shanghai by foreign banks, it is entirely for international trade. If the "puppet superintendent" insists on acting arbitrarily, it will cause significant losses to various countries' trade with China, and the various countries will inevitably lodge serious protests. According to sources from foreign banks, the legal tender being transported belongs to them, and the "superintendent" has no right to interfere.</p>
<p>Speculation Stirring Up the Market</p>
<p>The black markets for foreign exchange and gold in Shanghai are beyond the reach of the government's temporary authority, and are entirely manipulated by speculative merchants for profit. Recently, due to the improvement in China's foreign trade, funds from Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places have returned to Shanghai, causing the black market for foreign exchange to ease and the black market for gold to plummet. Speculators dared not manipulate the market again, and the entire financial system gradually returned to normal. Since "Jianghai Customs Superintendent" Li Jiannan attempted to prevent legal tender from coming to Shanghai, a group of speculators have again contemplated making trouble, deliberately spreading rumors. However, it is expected that they will ultimately suffer a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>Black Market for Gold, Foreign Exchange, and Securities</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai financial market: (1) Foreign Exchange Black Market: The British HSBC quoted the British pound at 4.75 yuan, down from 5. The US dollar was quoted at 7.6875 yuan, down from 5.625. (2) Gold Black Market: The morning closing price was 3,740 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 3,730 yuan. (3) Securities: Unified Class A: The morning closing price was 56.45 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 56.30 yuan. Class B: The morning closing price was 48.25 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 48.40 yuan. Class C: The morning closing price was 46.80 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 46.80 yuan. Class D: The morning closing price was 46.50 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 46.40 yuan. Class E: The morning closing price was 47.45 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 47.40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yang Jinhai and Luo Zhibin Shot Dead Yesterday; Both Worked for the Japanese; They Died from Gunshots While Hosting a Banquet in a Restaurant</h3>
<p>At 7:20 PM yesterday, the Wanli Restaurant at 514 Fuzhou Road was crowded with guests and brightly lit. Suddenly, a shooting occurred at banquet tables 22 and 23 on the second floor. Yang Jinhai and Luo Zhibin, who were working for the Japanese military police as special agents, were shot dead on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strong Men Entered the Room and Opened Fire</p>
<p>Four or five days ago, a man named Yang Jinhai reserved five tables of banquets for 20 yuan each at the restaurant. Around 7 PM yesterday, the invited guests arrived in succession, reaching forty or fifty people. As they were taking their seats, just as the cold dishes were being served and before anyone had raised their cups, five or six strong men in black robes suddenly appeared. One to three of them stayed at the entrance of the restaurant to keep watch, while three others rushed upstairs, entered Yang Jinhai's reserved banquet rooms 22 and 23. Looking around, they saw Yang and Luo sitting side-by-side at the northwest end of the room. The three strong men immediately rushed to the table and opened fire on them. Everyone at the banquet, who had been in high spirits, was terrified upon hearing the gunshots and scrambled to escape.</p>
<p>Yang and Luo Killed on the Spot</p>
<p>At that time, the restaurant's tea servers and bookkeepers also heard the gunshots and hid on Fuzhou Road. Other guests at the restaurant also rushed down from the second floor. In this extremely tense situation, the three strong men continued to fire more than ten shots. Yang Jinhai was shot three times in the head, and Luo Zhibin was shot four times in the waist. Both died on the spot. The other people at the table were not affected. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the assassins calmly went downstairs, exited the restaurant among the crowd, and fled east towards Hubei Road, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Police Arrived and Investigated</p>
<p>After the incident, nearby police officers arrived after hearing the alarm. Because the assassins had already escaped without a trace, they transported the two dead men to Renji Hospital, and then transferred them to the coroner's office to await examination by the First Special District Court. After receiving the report, the police sent a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate, and collected the remaining bullets for filing and investigation. They also intensified their efforts to track down the assassins to find out the truth.</p>
<p>The Deceased Both Worked for the Japanese</p>
<p>Yang Jinhai, 41 years old, was from Yangzhou. He was a burly man who lived at 21 Xinle Village, Singapore Road. He was previously a barber and was penniless. Since taking a puppet position, he has acquired assets worth tens of thousands. He is currently the deputy captain of the Japanese military police's self-defense force. Luo Zhibin, over 30 years old, was also from Yangzhou. He was a slender man who lived at 4 Yongle Village, Jixifei Road in western Shanghai. He used to live in Japan and worked as a barber. After the war, Luo returned to China and was introduced to the Japanese West District Military Police Special Task Force in western Shanghai as a translator. Recently, a special task force was established at Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, with Zhang Jirong (i.e., Little Jirong) as the captain and Luo Zhibin as the deputy.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fighting Along the Jinghu and Huhang Railways; Tensions High in Changzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou; Japanese Troops South of the Huangpu Rely on Japanese Warships for Protection</h3>
<p>Recently, the regular Chinese army and guerrilla forces have launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) railways and in various towns in southern Jiangsu. According to someone from Danyang, the recent situation there is as follows:</p>
<p>Four Vehicles Destroyed Near Benniu</p>
<p>Around midnight on the 1st of this month, a train of military vehicles traveling from Nanjing triggered a landmine between Benniu and Xin'an (in Wujin County) at the Lianjiang Bridge. There was a loud explosion, and thick smoke rose into the air. One locomotive and three freight cars were destroyed, causing extremely heavy losses. However, the number of casualties is unknown. It is said that the landmine was planted by a mobile unit of southern Jiangsu. After the incident, traffic between Changzhou and Danyang on the Jinghu Railway was interrupted until the 3rd, when it was repaired and reopened.</p>
<p>Passengers on the Jinghu Railway Are Wary</p>
<p>According to the visitor, near Shitangwan, west of Wuxi, and near Weiting, east of Suzhou, he witnessed several sections of train cars that had been destroyed by bombings, lying on the side of the road. The car bodies were completely destroyed, with only the chassis remaining, lying askew in the autumn grass. Because train bombings frequently occur on the Jinghu Railway, passengers are wary when taking the train and dare not take the early trains departing from Nanjing and Shanghai to avoid unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Changzhou Planning a Counterattack</p>
<p>According to someone from Changzhou, although the fighting in the southwestern villages of Wujin has come to an end, it is rumored that the Chinese Tenth Army is planning a major counterattack in conjunction with other regular troops and local forces. As a result, the Japanese troops stationed in towns such as Nieli, Xiaxi, and Chengzhang dare not withdraw. Residents in the city live in fear every day, and the market is depressed. Some people have fled to Shanghai to take refuge. The Japanese army's inspection of passengers on the Jinghu Railway has also become more strict. The gates of Suzhou have been opened and closed sporadically for more than ten days.</p>
<p>Tense Situation in Hangzhou</p>
<p>The situation in Hangzhou has been very tense since the Chinese troops under General Tian mobilized along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. According to railway sources, merchants in Hangzhou have begun to withdraw their goods in recent days. On the day before yesterday, there were as many as four trains loaded with goods coming to Shanghai. Japanese merchants also had a considerable amount of goods.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops in Southern Pudong Successfully Linked Up</p>
<p>The towns and villages in Tangwan Township, which belongs to Shanghai County, have been recovered by the Second Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force. The Chinese side has also organized a wartime county government in a certain place to command the troops, successfully linking up the various units from Qingpu, Sijing, Qibao, along the Caohejing River in western Shanghai to Tianmashan Mountain in Songjiang, and along the Shangsong Highway at Changqiao, Huiqiao, across Qianbu Canal, Xinqiao, Xinzhuang, and Zhuanqiao Qianliang Temple. The Japanese troops in Beiqiao are surrounded on both sides. During the day, they only guard the traffic line on the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, and in the evening they gather at the headquarters in Minhang and Beiqiao. Therefore, from 6:00 PM onwards, the Shanghai-Minhang Highway is bustling with guerrillas. The sentries on both sides of the highway can see each other, and the sound of gunfire is constant throughout the night. The Japanese troops dare not interfere. The vanguard of the guerrilla forces on the south bank of the Huangpu River has reached the edge of the river, guarding against the Japanese troops. Helpless, in order to protect the Japanese troops on both banks, there are as many as six warships in the southern Huangpu River, one at the blockade line, one at the Longhua Cement Factory, one at Tangkou, one at Zha Port, one at Guan Port, and one at Minhang. At night, searchlights shine in all directions to show intimidation.</p>
<h3>Schools Commemorate Ma Xiangbo; One Day of Mourning; No Restrictions on Outside Participation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai community initiated a memorial service for the centenarian Ma Xiangbo. A preparatory committee was established at the Bankers' Club on a day prior, and the organizational structure of the preparatory committee was formed. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 13th to discuss all preparatory matters. Fudan and Aurora Universities in the city have also scheduled separate memorial ceremonies on the 15th of this month. The Aurora University Board of Directors issued a notice to all faculty and students yesterday that they would attend the Catholic Church on Luban Road at that time, and the school would not impose any restrictions on external participation. It is hoped that various groups and Catholic friends will actively participate and join in the grand event. It is said that the memorial mass ceremony will be presided over by one bishop and two priests. The bishop plans to invite Zhu Xianmei, Ma's nephew Zhu Zhiyao's brother and the current bishop of Haimen District, to preside. One of the priests is Father Cai Ermeng, a member of the Aurora University Board of Directors, and the other has not yet been decided. If Bishop Zhu is unable to come to Shanghai, the ceremony will be presided over by Father Cai Ermeng. The Fudan University memorial service has been undertaken by the Fudan Alumni Association. There are no fewer than several thousand alumni from the university and the affiliated high school, who, although now scattered in various places, still have a considerable number remaining in Shanghai. The school will be presided over by President Li Denghui. On that day, in addition to suspending classes for one day, all faculty and students will wear black cloth to mourn for one day to show their condolences.</p>
<h3>US Marine Corps Postpones Grand Exercise Due to Deep Water Accumulation at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the 4th US Marine Corps in Shanghai, originally scheduled to hold a parade at the racecourse tomorrow (the 10th) to commemorate the 164th anniversary of its founding, has indefinitely postponed the parade and reception due to the accumulation of water at the racecourse, which is unlikely to dry out in a few days.</p>
<h3>China's Resistance Against Japan Is Actually Fighting for the United States; The United States Should Fully Assist China; Further Tolerance Will Lead to Regret; The Candid Remarks of American Economist Babson</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Babson, a prominent American economist, recently returned to the United States from the Orient and expressed his opinion that China, in its war of resistance against Japan, is actually fighting for the United States and should therefore receive assistance from the United States. The Sino-Japanese War has now exhausted the Japanese people, and they may have deeply regretted provoking this war. It is generally believed that the reproductive rate of the Chinese people will eventually drive the Japanese troops out of China. At the same time, if the United States does not provide more assistance, China's position will inevitably be unfavorable. The Japanese people are indeed industrious and worthy of friendship, but the Japanese military can only be compared to Stalin and Hitler in terms of their evil deeds. The Japanese invasion of China will be the most brutal and unreasonable act in history. The Japanese military leaders are unrestrained, and their attack on China is only because China has finally begun to strengthen itself. They fear that if China acquires machinery and production, it will cause Japanese commerce to plummet, and they openly admit that this is a never-to-be-repeated opportunity.</p>
<p>The Cruelty of the Japanese Troops Is Like That of Savages</p>
<p>I (Babson speaking) was appalled by the destruction I witnessed in China. In addition, I have personally spoken with reliable consuls, merchants, and missionaries from the interior, and they all believe that the actions of the more than one million Japanese soldiers in China are like those of a group of cruel and desperate savages. Murder, rape, torture, and destruction are not enough to describe their crimes.</p>
<p>Chinese Assets Moved to the Interior</p>
<p>The normally peace-loving Chinese people have been greatly stimulated to rise up and resist, using the most ingenious strategies and guerrilla warfare to defend themselves. There are few positional battles between the two armies, but they are divided into small units, fighting anytime and anywhere. The most hopeful sign in the whole incident is that 400 million people are carrying machinery, tools, and livestock from the densely populated cities of eastern China to the rich and undeveloped western provinces. Hundreds of factories have traveled thousands of miles to the interior, and railway tracks are being dismantled and transported inward by coolies. Thousands of new cooperative industries are now being established in the new western regions.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Only Control Transportation Lines</p>
<p>Japan now occupies many of China's ports, but smuggling of goods in and out is still being carried out on a large scale. The Japanese army controls most of the areas east of the Pinghan and Yuehan Railways to the coast, but there are still millions of people in this area who have never seen a Japanese soldier. To the west of these two railways, 300 million people continue to work as usual.</p>
<p>China Has the Power to Drive Out the Japanese Troops</p>
<p>The Chinese government has moved to Chongqing, which is impregnable. Although it is bombed every week or two, the damage is minimal. It is foolish for anyone to predict how long the Sino-Japanese War will last. It is generally believed that the reproductive rate of the Chinese people alone will eventually drive the Japanese troops out of China. From what I have seen in Japan, the war has exhausted the Japanese people, and they may have deeply regretted provoking this war.</p>
<p>The United States Should Provide Economic Assistance</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the United States must provide greater economic assistance to the Chinese government, or at least cut off supplies to the Japanese troops. Otherwise, China will inevitably be at a disadvantage. In fact, China is currently fighting for the same principles as it would for the people of Hawaii. I believe that the current attitude of the US government in assisting the Japanese troops is suicidal. The people of Hawaii should do their utmost to assist China, at least until the current European war ends and Britain and France are free to take action in the East.</p>
<p>The Task of the United States Is Fivefold</p>
<p>In order to succeed the United States must complete the following five tasks: (1) Curb the blind religious belief of Japan that it is destined to rule all of Asia, including Hawaii; (2) Prevent the Soviet Union from spreading communism in China as the price for assisting China's resistance against Japan; (3) Engage in humanitarian service, saving 25 million innocent men, women, and children from slaughter and suffering; (4) Salvage valuable American trade and shipping in China, which is essential for the United States to solve its unemployment problem; (5) Protect our 500 million yuan in church property that we have spent a century building up. In short, we are now mistakenly showing tolerance, and if we continue to tolerate it, we will regret it in the future.</p>

<h3>Patrol Police Arrest Man Carrying a Gun; Bust Arms Agency; Confessed to Planning Assassination of a Certain Person</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department, recently due to the approach of winter defense, has been extraordinarily strict with defense within the concession in recent days. In addition to the full deployment of armored vehicles on patrol, patrol teams are divided into groups to patrol and search various roads. At 7:45 the night before last, a number of Chinese and Western detectives from the patrol team were patrolling at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet when they suddenly saw a man with a panicked expression. They immediately stepped forward to search him and found a six-inch pistol and eleven bullets on him. After taking him back to the police station, he confessed that his name was Wang A'yu, 30 years old, from Ningbo. He confessed that he was ordered to go to a certain address in Fengyuli on Route Paul Henry to assassinate a certain person surnamed. He also confessed that the general agency was located at 253 Route Tenant de la Tour. According to the confession, the police immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to the address and found a huge amount of arms in the house. However, when they entered, the house was empty, so no one was apprehended. The police station is currently investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Cold Wave Hits Shanghai; Drastic Change in Climate</h3>
<p>According to a United Press reporter who inquired with the observatory, a northern high-pressure system is now moving towards southern China, so Shanghai is about to be hit by a cold wave. Yesterday morning, the temperature in Peiping had already dropped to two degrees below zero. The climate there is already extremely cold. Shanghai has had intermittent rain for several days, and the rainfall became more rapid in the afternoon the day before yesterday. The wind and rain continued all night, and water dripped continuously from the eaves. The climate has also changed drastically. The temperature dropped to 57 degrees at 9:00 AM (it was 69.4 degrees at 9:00 AM the day before), and the weather was particularly bad.</p>
<h3>Beixin Bookstore Warehouse Forcibly Evicted; Hundreds of Boxes of Books Soaked in Water; Losses of Tens of Thousands of Yuan; Will Sue According to Law</h3>
<p>The Xuyuan (Xu Garden) on Route Combault in western Shanghai is owned by the brothers Xu Guanyun and Xu Lingyun. After the "August 13th" Incident, they rented it to the Beixin Bookstore as a warehouse at a relatively low price. Later, part of the rear of the garden was used as a refugee shelter, housing several thousand refugees for many years. Most of the buildings were badly damaged. The owners repeatedly requested that the shelter be evacuated by a certain date. Later, the shelter was dissolved due to a shortage of funds, and the damaged buildings were repaired once, with losses exceeding several thousand yuan. Then, the Beixin Bookstore used the remaining repaired houses to establish Jianxing Middle School, widely admitting aspiring students. Unexpectedly, the owners of Xuyuan, on the grounds that the contract stated that it could not be sublet, sued the school in court, demanding that part of the school be evacuated, but to no avail. In the heavy rain on the 8th, the owners Xu Guanyun and Xu Lingyun led dozens of workers to the garden and forcibly moved three or four hundred boxes of books from the bookstore, throwing them on the desolate field. All the books were soaked in water, causing losses of more than tens of thousands of yuan. It is said that Beixin Bookstore, due to the owners' use of force and the huge losses suffered, has decided to sue in court.</p>
<h3>Two Arrested in Chen Lu Assassination Case</h3>
<p>News Agency reported that the Japanese side publicly announced yesterday that after Chen Lu, the puppet "Reformed Government" Foreign Minister, was assassinated in western Shanghai on February 19 of this year, the Japanese military police arrested two important figures in the case, Fu Ning native Ping Hu and Songjiang native Tan Baoyi, on June 29 at 14 Avenue du Roi Albert, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession. The pair confessed to acting under the leadership of their superior You Heqing to carry out the shooting at Chen's residence, and then left by car. A few days later, they separately traveled by ship to Hong Kong, and came to Shanghai again in late June. At the same time, Japanese newspapers in Shanghai published photos of Ping and Tan.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Kangyi Lane Oppose Rent Increase; Write to the Taxpayers' Association to Stop It</h3>
<p>The houses in Kangyi Lane, 39 Route Conty, in the French Concession, are managed by the Jiyi Real Estate Company. The rent was already high, and after two rent increases in 1930 and 1938, the owner suddenly notified the tenants that the rent would be increased by another 30% on top of the original rent. The tenants, upon hearing the news, felt that at this extraordinary time, the owner's repeated large rent increases were not considerate of the people's hardships, so they wrote to the owner asking him to withdraw the order. Yesterday, the tenants jointly wrote to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, asking them to uphold justice and find a way to stop it.</p>
<h3>Raising Funds for Refugee Winter Clothing; Holding Variety Show</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens' Group Committee, in order to raise funds for refugee winter clothing, plans to hold a variety show at the Gengxin Dance Hall on Niuzhuang Road.

This solo exhibition will feature more than 140 works, all of which are masterpieces from his travels in the southwest.</p>
<h3>Kato Gaimusho's Arrival in Shanghai; Will Visit Nanjing and Wuhan; Rumor Was That He Went to Nanshi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese special envoy Kato Gaimusho returned to his post on the Nagasaki Maru on the 7th, and arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 PM on the prior day (the 8th). Kato's arrival in Shanghai this time is to discuss various issues with the diplomatic representatives of third countries stationed in Shanghai, to supplement the negotiations between Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Kichisaburo and British Ambassador Craigie and American Ambassador Grew in Tokyo. He will also visit Nanjing, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. At 2:00 PM yesterday, four Japanese cars passed through Xinkai River and headed towards Nanshi. The first car carried three senior Japanese officers and one Japanese in Western clothing. The following three cars carried nineteen armed Japanese soldiers. It is rumored that the person in Western clothing was Kato.</p>
<h3>The Panama Incident Under Investigation; After the US Consulate Protests; The Japanese Side Has Responded</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that it was learned this morning (the 9th) that regarding the detention of the Panamanian ship Polivar, after the US Consulate in this city, representing the government of that country, protested, the Japanese authorities are continuing their investigation. It is said that after the US Consulate protested last week, it received a reply from the Japanese Consulate, stating that it was investigating the detention of the ship. In the past few days, the Japanese authorities have continued to investigate. It is reported that the Polivar was detained by Japanese special agents three weeks ago after arriving in Shanghai from southern China. A Chinese second mate who was arrested has not yet been released.</p>
<h3>Following Successive Declines in Rice and Commodity Prices, Living Expenses Show Initial Reduction; Slight Decline After a Sharp Monthly Increase in the Cost of Mental Labor; Common People Psychologically Begin to Feel Slightly Relieved</h3>
<p>Since December of last year, for ten months, the cost of living index for workers in this city has risen continuously. Only in October did it begin to decrease. The index for October was 248.22, a decrease of 12.36% compared to 283.23 in September. The purchasing power of currency also increased accordingly. In October, one yuan of legal tender (Fa Bi) in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) was worth 40.29 cents. The classified index showed that the fuel category decreased by 21.78% compared to the previous month, and the food category decreased by 8.98%. Clothing and miscellaneous items increased, with clothing increasing by 10.20% and miscellaneous items by 5.610%. This index is still higher than in August, but after months of sharp increases, it is now initially decreasing. The hardship of the common people's lives is shocking, and the psychological comfort gained is not insignificant. Items such as rice, vegetables, and coal briquettes, which are daily necessities, have all decreased in price this month, which is very beneficial to the livelihood of the common people.</p>
<p>Main Reasons for the Decline</p>
<p>There are several main reasons for the decline in commodity prices this month. Since the outbreak of the European War, prices of all goods have risen sharply. However, the impact on the import market has not been as severe as expected. This is the first reason. Since this month, exchange rates have loosened, and the value of legal tender has become more stable. This is the second reason. Speculators, seeing the unfavorable situation, are eager to sell off their holdings. This is the third reason. The price of rice has fallen, and the prices of various commodities have decreased accordingly. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>Decline in Rice and Coal Prices</p>
<p>The decrease in the price of rice is due to the bumper autumn harvest, the arrival of new crops, and the smoother flow of supplies. Second-grade japonica rice fell by 8.58% compared to the previous month, Xiang rice fell by 16.98%, and glutinous rice fell by 3.32%. Among vegetables, green vegetables, radishes, and spinach fell by 20% to 30%. Fresh and salted pork fell by 16.53% and 34.03% respectively. The price of coal briquettes has decreased, firstly because the supply of coal has not been interrupted, secondly because large factories are suppressing prices to compete with small factories, and thirdly because users have sufficient stockpiles and demand is not strong.</p>
<p>Clothing Prices Rise Alone</p>
<p>The prices of all clothing items have increased. Coarse cloth rose by 24.58% compared to the previous month, flannel rose by 19.75%, and bleached cloth rose by 16.59%, showing the most significant increases. As the weather turns cold and winter goods enter the market, coupled with the rising prices of cotton yarn and dyes, the clothing index has trended upwards. The prices of miscellaneous items have also increased, with soap, cigarettes, yellow wine, and sorghum each rising by 5% to 10% compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>People Expect Prices to Fall</p>
<p>According to observers, the European war has reached a stalemate and restrictions have been relaxed, allowing raw materials to be exported. Therefore, commodity prices in Shanghai are unlikely to rise further and may continue to fall this year. Furthermore, various coastal ports have been blockaded, sales to outside areas have stopped, and the purchasing power of Shanghai is weak, making business in the market sluggish. As the end of the year approaches, various industries are focused on maintaining cash flow, and people expect prices to fall. Therefore, a decline in commodity prices in the city is inevitable.

<p>New Base Period: Average for the 25th Year of the Republic (1936) equals 100</p>

<p>The French Concession Police received a report the day before yesterday that a drug trafficking operation was being run inside No. 1007 Xiafei Road. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to search the premises and arrested two Koreans, Lin Daze and Cao Junqing, seizing 37 packets of morphine and money from sales. Four addicts, Hou Wenbao, Zhang A'er, Zhang Genfu, and Zhou Changfa, were also arrested. The two Koreans and the evidence were handed over to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. The four Chinese were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon, where Judge Miao Qingbang questioned them and ordered them to be detained for a further hearing on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Burglary in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>At about 10 PM the night before last, the home of farmer Wu Guansheng in Wu Ni Lu Jiaxiang Village, Hongqiao Town, Western Shanghai, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits speaking the Jiangbei dialect. Armed with knives and clubs, they broke into the house and stole legal tender and clothing worth over 100 yuan. They then broke into the homes of Kunlin, Wu Shengquan, and Wu A'xiang, stealing not only clothing and silver dollars but also over ten quilts and beddings. Fortunately, the villagers sounded the alarm and gathered a crowd, forcing the bandits to flee with their loot.</p>
<p>Wang Jinqing, a local who lives in Wangjiazhai at the intersection of Huobilan Road and Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai and sells fancy clothing, was on his way home from Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. While passing the entrance of Wangjia Ancestral Hall Lane on Lujia Road, near Columbia Road, he was suddenly ambushed by three bandits who jumped out from the roadside with pistols. They robbed him of the 350 yuan of legal tender he was carrying (including 50 yuan in Central Bank fractional notes) and a wristwatch. The bandits then fled towards Zuo Jiazhai.</p>

<h3>The Movement to Eradicate Flower Games</h3>
<p>— Fu Yong</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the "flower games" that had died out have begun to revive. Currently, it is difficult to estimate the number of "listening post" organizations that poison the uninformed masses. Not only are they operating openly in the badlands of special areas, but they have also spread rapidly and secretly to the densely populated concessions. Not long ago, the police uncovered a "listening post" on Belle Road, which is one example.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a serious problem for public safety and society. Although Shanghai is a large metropolis with a relatively high level of culture, the illiterate and ignorant people without knowledge still account for a large proportion of the population. They are all poor people who rely on their own labor to support themselves. Because of their lack of knowledge, they are easily blindly followed; because of the temptation of material things, they are easily fascinated. So they fall into the poisonous net of "playing flower games" again and again. It is truly a case of the more they play, the poorer they become; the poorer they become, the more ruthless they become; and the more ruthless they become, the more they lose everything.</p>
<p>Eradicating these powerful organizations is not an easy task, especially since they have special protection in the badlands. The morbid state of the ignorant people is also a problem. I remember that a few of us young people once enthusiastically tried to persuade people in a small alley on Maite Hesitu Road, but the result was nothing. Many women answered us like this:</p>
<p>"I've already lost half of my family property, why would I be willing not to play?"</p>
<p>We explained the poison of "flower games" to them, and sincerely told them that if they continued to play, they would lose even more. It would be better to turn back and do some other work. They asked us suspiciously:</p>
<p>"Who are you people?..."</p>
<p>If we continued to talk, these ignorant widows would probably get angry at us for "bringing bad luck", so our hope became a bubble—failure!</p>
<p>Seeing the sad faces one by one, I was really sad. I felt sorry for their downfall.</p>
<p>The following are a few methods that I personally thought of to eradicate "flower games". Please give me your wise advice. I am pleading for help on their behalf here!</p>
<p>(1) The police should intensify their work to eradicate "listening posts".</p>
<p>(2) A small number of people who have awakened from their addiction should frankly report the "listening posts" and "sailing boats" they know to the police, so that the police can quickly take action and uncover them.</p>
<p>(3) Because it is not easy to eradicate these organizations from the root, we should also start by persuading the ignorant people. This must be done in an organized and systematic way, otherwise it will be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>(4) At a minimum, every intellectual should check their own family and related surroundings for ignorant people with this bad habit. If there are any, they should be properly advised and persuaded to understand the advantages and disadvantages and the greater good.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will come to save those common people who dream of getting rich! Let's save those whimsical fools! They are so pitiful!</p>
<h3>Banking Circles Hold Children's Health and Intelligence Contests</h3>
<p>— Min Wen</p>
<p>Employees in the banking industry are one of the most enviable professions. They work in tall buildings, do things with fixed hours, and can leave the office at four or five o'clock to go home and rest. The income is also quite generous, how can it not make people drool?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of people in the banking industry are small employees, and their living conditions will disappoint you greatly. A monthly salary of twenty or thirty yuan is a lot, and in Shanghai today, where prices are constantly rising, maintaining a family's food and clothing has become a problem. The education and health of children, who are said to be the future masters of China, must be of concern to society.</p>
<p>Recently, the Banking Association held a health competition and an intelligence competition for the children of its members, which will be held simultaneously on the anniversary of the Prime Minister's birth. The Banking Association, as we know, is the only amateur organization in the banking industry, with as many as 7,000 managers, employees, and apprentices. Therefore, this decision to pay attention to the problems of members' children is actually something that people in Shanghai, where life is extremely painful, have probably forgotten.</p>
<p>Their health competition is organized as follows: children or relatives of people in the banking industry can participate for free. The competition items include (1) height and weight (2) complexion (3) skin (4) bone and muscle (5) eyes (6) ears, nose, and throat (7) teeth (8) abdomen (9) reproductive organs (10) prevention. At the same time, they pay attention to the following four items: (1) general condition (happy, lively, agile, and robust) (2) movements (posture of sitting, standing, and walking, and standard movements) (3) speech (4) cleanliness.</p>
<p>The competition is divided into three groups, A, B, and C, according to age. The judging work is entrusted to Dr. Wang Shiwei of the Shanghai Health Association, and judging the results from a medical perspective is the most appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p>The qualifications for participating in the intelligence competition are the same as for the health competition, but the grouping of grades is changed to the school grade level. The competition is divided into four groups, from the first to the fourth grade. The competition items are divided into oral and written tests. All the questions are prepared by Mr. Cheng Weiling of Liben Primary School, so that this children's work is handled in the most open and reasonable way, and the most outstanding children are rewarded with valuable gifts to make them work harder.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that Christmas is coming in a month, and once a year, various groups contribute to give a group of stray lambs on the streets some toys, candy, and a happy day. This year, I hope that people in the banking industry will not sit idly by and watch the countless homeless children, and give some grace to them? (Qiao Chou)</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Xi Wai Encourages Reporters, New Territory, Fu Nei, Study of Internal Affairs, Small Stage Show</p>
<p>When Shao Huihua calculated the dates, she went to Hangzhou again. Then, from Jiaxing to Suzhou, she picked up Wu Junsu and went to Shanghai together to attend Jin Danyun's wedding banquet. Her motorcycle was sometimes taken with her and sometimes left at friends' houses, with no fixed arrangement. Weren't these vehicles supposed to be registered? In fact, at that time, there were two types of vehicle registration in China. One type was only valid for use in the city, and the other was valid for use throughout the country. The current vehicle registration offices in China all operate in this way. The registration fee for vehicles only used in the city was very low, but the vehicle could not be driven outside the city. The other type of registration, which was valid for use throughout the country, allowed the vehicle to travel anywhere in the country. The vehicle registration fee for the latter was probably ten times that of the former. This applied to all types of cars, animal-drawn vehicles, motorcycles, rickshaws, and all kinds of vehicles. The Ministry of Transportation in China had a national vehicle registration office, and each province and county also had national vehicle registration sub-offices. By looking at the first character on the registration certificate, one could tell where the vehicle was from and which province and county it was registered in. Shao Huihua's motorcycle was a custom-made women's motorcycle from the United States. In addition to the seat, there was a folding leather pouch attached to the side that could accommodate another person. When not needed, it could be folded up and was barely visible. All kinds of repair tools were included. When Shao Huihua ordered this motorcycle, it cost her 1,500 US dollars, which everyone said was a very good deal. After she had this motorcycle, she could go anywhere. Originally, the highways in China were already accessible in all directions. However, during the Sino-Japanese War, for military reasons, many well-built highways were forcibly destroyed and dug up. Because it was not worth it to let these highways be used by the enemy. But the roadbeds were still there, and the bridges that had been blown up also needed to be rebuilt, but with the foundation in place, it was of course much easier. I don't know if there were more highways after the war than before the war. Moreover, the increase in highways in China was not limited to the post-war period. Even during the war, many were added. For example, many of the highways in the southwest and northwest were built during the war. Therefore, due to the development of highways in China, whether it was a car or a motorcycle like Shao Huihua's, one could travel around the country. Whether it was as far as Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner and Outer Mongolia, one could go. (201)</p>
<h3>Tenants in Garages</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Editor: In the western district, many garages behind Western-style houses have been rented out. I am one of the garage tenants. When I took refuge in Shanghai, it was the most densely populated time in Shanghai. Being able to rent such a garage to live in was considered very lucky. But I also wondered, after they rented out the garages, where did they park their cars? If the rent collected was used to pay for the rent of parking the car elsewhere, given the value of land in Shanghai today, there wouldn't be much surplus. Besides, sitting in a car is for comfort, isn't it more troublesome now? After living there for a few months, I learned that my landlord had left Shanghai, and the car may have been sold. It was their bookkeeper who rented out the small Western-style house and included the garage in the monthly income. In fact, I had said long ago that it was all the same to have a place to take shelter from the wind and rain, and some of the houses in our hometown were not as well-appointed as the garage! However, when the last hurricane came to Shanghai, there was a problem. It turned out that the garage was built of wooden planks, with mud and lime plastered on the outside. After two days of rain, the mud and lime peeled off, and the rainwater flowed down the wooden planks like tadpoles. Because the terrain was low, there was standing water underneath. If the hurricane had not left Shanghai immediately, the garage would have been a victim of the wind and rain. Of course, I had negotiated with the landlord, and the bookkeeper had promised to repair it. But time passed, and he claimed to have negotiated with the main landlord. Yesterday, it rained all day again, and my residence was leaking above and accumulating below, making it a home on the water. Because I saw that the last negotiation was ineffective, I decided to move. However, I had to speak out: Although it is a garage, the rent is not cheap, and this is a common phenomenon. There is no need to talk about conscience. But the tenant has paid the rent, and the landlord should be responsible for the repairs. Wasn't there a news story in the newspaper the day before yesterday about a collapsed building? It was probably due to years of disrepair, and because it was borrowed by a school, the students jumping and playing led to the tragedy. If another hurricane hits the garage I live in, these temporary wooden planks may be blown away. Raising the rent is just a matter of money, but now they don't care about the lives of the tenants at all.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the past year or so, the landlords in Shanghai have all become very rich. Please don't be short-sighted. We have seen houses that are not very old being demolished in the name of reconstruction in order to raise the rent and drive out the tenants, leading to fights and lawsuits. But why are those houses that are truly in imminent danger left unattended?</p>
<p>Now that winter has arrived, in times of strong winds and heavy snow, who can guarantee that there will be no house collapse tragedies in those garages (and other similarly simply built houses) and houses that have been in disrepair for many years? This is a more serious problem than raising the rent, and I hope people from all walks of life will pay attention to it!</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I am writing to you because I work at the Changde Shipping Company's ship radio station and usually don't pay attention to news in the newspapers. However, I heard from a friend that your newspaper published a "Report on Those Taking the Radio Operator Exam" on October 14th. After reading the full text, I found it to be inconsistent with the facts. After checking, I found that "Yihua Foreign Company" had entrusted a neighbor to recruit dozens of radio operators on July 13th of this year to work on the company's ship radio stations. I was ordered to take charge of this matter and carefully selected talent through examinations. Later, due to the outbreak of the European War, the original ships had all shortened their routes, and the company's original plans could not be realized. I deeply regret that I was unable to send the selected personnel to work in the shortest possible time. The claim of recruiting personnel under false pretenses, which is close to fraud, is obviously an excessive statement from those who were not sent to work. This matter concerns my personal reputation. I respectfully request that your newspaper clarify this matter and publish it to correct public opinion and avoid misunderstandings. I would be deeply grateful. (No. 20, Donglinli, Jiaxiyi Road, Jin Shenfu Road) Sincerely, Xi Jicheng (Seal) November 8th.</p>

<h3>US-Educated Playwright Zhang Junxiang Returns to China – Will Give Lectures in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The young playwright Zhang Junxiang originally studied at Huaqing University and conducted in-depth research on dramatic theory. His spirit of hard work and dedication is admirable. After graduating from Qinghua University, he participated in the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Examination. Cao Yu, a famous playwright, also participated in the examination that year. As a result, Zhang Junxiang ranked first, while Cao Yu ranked second. Zhang Junxiang was awarded the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship and went to the United States the year before last. He was the first drama student among the Boxer Indemnity scholars. In the United States, Zhang Junxiang was studious and was valued by the American theater community. Due to the outbreak of the war, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship was suspended, and Zhang had to return to China. He arrived in Shanghai on the 7th of this month and went to the Xuan Palace the night before to watch "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty." He was very surprised to see the play being performed at this time and in this place. It is said that Zhang plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days and may be invited to give a lecture on drama in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Longing for Love – The Old Maid</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"This child does not belong to me, because her father does not belong to me!" This sorrowful cry is not only the tragedy of Bette Davis, but also the tragedy of thousands of women deprived of lifelong happiness by feudal society! However, the playwright of "Longing for Love" did not directly attack feudal society. He used a moving story to indirectly stir the hearts of the audience. That final kiss, that painful smile, was not "comfort," but the "end" of this unfortunate woman, just like the English title "The Old Maid." It satirizes not Bette Davis, but the feudal society that made Bette Davis an "old maid" for life.</p>
<p>Having seen Bette Davis in "Dark Victory," her excellent acting skills made it impossible for us to forget that "self-sacrificing" woman. "Longing for Love" will forever make us remember that "pitiful" Charlotte. On the day she was to marry, her sister Delia discovered Clement's illegitimate daughter, Tina. From then on, she was deprived of the happiness of life. Her daughter Tina got married, and she finally dared not tell her that she was her mother. Bette Davis, from girlhood to old age, every scene can stir the audience's emotions, and make the audience move from excitement to sympathy, and then to anger!</p>
<p>Director Edmund Goulding also very delicately analyzes the emotions of the actors on the screen. For example, Delia, Charlotte and Tina's marriages, he can analyze the different emotions of the actors at each level. Especially when Charlotte brings Tina to live at home, when the children are asleep at night, the children say good night to their mother and good night to their aunt, his delicate technique is "truly moving." Tina and Charlotte's relationship, especially the scenes before and after the wedding, are even more lovely. For example, when Lonny sends Tina home, when Charlotte wants to rush out, Delia comes down from upstairs, Delia and Tina go upstairs, two black shadows, from small to large, almost pounce on Bette Davis; Charlotte wants to tell Tina the secret of more than ten years, and finally says good night and comes out; and the final farewell kiss, he fully grasps the emotional expression of each actor.</p>
<p>The liveliness of the camera and the appropriate coordination of music are only minor matters.</p>
<h3>Southern Arts Circle</h3>
<p>— Cui Ping</p>
<p>Hu Die's new film "Peerless Beauty" was originally scheduled to start work on the first of this month, but it has been postponed due to insufficient production of costumes and props. Hu has recently been living in seclusion and staying at home all day, silently reciting the script of "Peerless Beauty," trying to figure out the personality of Chen Yuanyuan, the role she plays. Hu said to people: She has not had a new film for more than a year since "Rouge Tears," and she personally believes that she did not perform as well as she wanted in "Rouge Tears." Therefore, she will do her best for "Peerless Beauty" in order to maintain her inherent reputation.</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu is working hard to revive the China Travel Troupe, but unfortunately the old team has all been disbanded. Even Tang's biological daughters, Tang Ruoqing and Ruoying, have parted ways with their father, let alone others. Therefore, the revival of the China Travel Troupe is generally considered difficult to be optimistic about. It is heard that Tang intends to recruit new drama talents, give them considerable training, and put them on stage after their performance skills have matured. Therefore, he has invited Hong Kong movie stars to guest star in his newly written play "Children's Situation" for free, in order to use the income to fund the revival of the China Travel Troupe.</p>
<p>Gu Wuwei went to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 30th of last month, carrying two trailers for "Flower of the Earth." This trip is to negotiate the screening of "Flower of the Earth" in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Li Siming, a technical consultant of Hollywood MGM Films, has now arrived in Hong Kong from the United States. Li has a good reputation in Hollywood. He was born in Sydney, Australia, and went to the United States to study five years ago. He was also hired by MGM to serve as a Chinese technical consultant, that is, if there are any Chinese stories to be filmed in the film, opinions will be sought from Li first to avoid repeating the mistakes of humiliating China. Before deciding to return to China, Li also traveled to major cities with many Chinese artists to promote culture. In addition, Li's short film "Rainbow Path," starring in MGM, was also shown at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong on the 4th.</p>
<p>Tyrone Power is about to show off his skills in the most "dramatic" film, "The Rains Came." He and Annabella have just returned to the United States from their honeymoon in Europe.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Sudden Break in Old Male and Old Female Roles</p>
<p>Also, Gong Yunfu, the number one old female role performer, when he was nearly seventy years old, I repeatedly begged him to perform the scene of "Scolding Cao." This old man was unusually energetic that day. After dozens of lines of dialogue, he continued to sing more than ten lines of "Er Liu" "Fast Clapper," and the most wonderful thing was that he suddenly made a sudden break at the word "thief" in "If you want my son to be under your control, you Cao thief, you are daydreaming, you are wasting your efforts." It was truly unusually clever. Furthermore, in "He Jiu One Branch Mountain" "Great Protector of the Country" in those years, every time during "(And sing) Gold-Inlaid Jade, Strike Down (Net Sing) Copper Hammer Smash You Into Powder," he would definitely make a sudden break at the word "hammer." It is rare to see someone using a sudden break while playing a clean role, and Old He actually did it excellently without feeling tired, which is probably impossible without a naturally good voice.</p>
<p>In short, a sudden break is like spicy chicken and twice-cooked pork in Beijing and Sichuan cuisine. In the midst of sourness, sweetness, saltiness, and blandness, it suddenly mixes in a spicy flavor, which indeed makes people feel refreshed. In recent times, female roles have been very popular for a while, and Shanghai people are really tired of listening to charming voices. At the same time, there are few talented people among the male roles, and there is no one with particularly good talent. Those whose singing and pronunciation enter the ear drums are less than one in ten. How can one talk about the sound of a great bell or the deafening sudden break? Duo Kui is uniquely able to meet these conditions and meet these needs, so that the tens of thousands of opera fans on the isolated island can hear this robust new voice in the midst of gentleness, without having to stretch their necks, bend their waists, concentrate their minds, and wrinkle their brows to listen to the subtle Buddhist music. Although it costs two silver dollars, one can still buy several sections of Pi Huang in a satisfying manner. Therefore, Duo Kui's arrival is indeed a shot in the arm for the opera world. (137)</p>
