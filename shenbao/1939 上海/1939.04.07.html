<p>昨據重慶電傳：謂在精衛竟與日本首相平沼訂立密約；鑿鑿列舉，事事出乎意表；喪心病在，諸非恒情恒理所可想像；夫遠乖人性矣，宜非吾人所及料也。彼不惟遷就一時之事實，妥協投降而已，且於軍事有進一步之獻計為：以中國中央政府改編軍隊未竣為可乘之機會，乃促日本猛攻，以西安南寗長沙襄陽樊城為目標；窺彼之意，以為必如是也，始足以掩護其憧憬之小朝廷；必如是也，始置國民政府於絕境。彼自為謀者：蓄爪牙二十師，以暢其書生萬能，文武兼資之迷夢；稱總裁，以遂其歷年覬覦為領袖之迷夢；月索三百萬，躉取二萬萬，以完成其富貴兩全之迷夢；撒廢北平南京之傀儡組織，以貫澈其包辦賣國之迷夢；旣欲媚德義，又不敢開罪英美，是則別有借重外援，永保祿位之迷夢焉。嗚呼，往日汪精衛之所曉曉以遍聞當世者：以兩敗俱喪，兩存俱榮，為其主張之論據者也；以中國前途，東亞前途，為其立論之對象者也；其論據淺薄，顧或可欺幼稚，其對象噯昧，顧或可謂堂皇；今試按之密約之內容，可知彼之所謂存榮者，在精衛與日本之存榮也；彼之所謂前途者，在精衛與日本之前途也；豈有他哉，豈有他哉！</p>
<p>日本之所謂「支那通」，有其不可及之刻苦功夫，然刻舟求劍，而不自知其時過境遷；故於蔣委員長領導下之中華民國，為日人所絕不理解；此次貿然發動武力侵略，乃致焦頭爛額，力盡筋疲，欲罷不能，無以為繼；是為不足恤亦不可恕之根本錯誤。若乃勾結無聊之在精衛，締結無用之密約，此而謂非繼續其「支那通」傳統之錯誤，即是明知其為類於畫餅望梅，徒以饑渴之甚，慰情聊勝於無。而數百萬乃至二萬萬之為鉅數，然在中國長期抗戰之下，日本為無期勝利，無盡消耗，軍費以百萬計者，二者相較，則密約所賄在飼在之數，即未可視為極鉅。况以中國之大，蘊藏之富，則以數百萬乃至二萬萬為注，雖屬成效縹緲，然二者相較，猶是「一本萬利」之賭博也。平沼結在，非以此歟？</p>
<p>抑密約云云，其千眞萬確，洵有之乎？本報以路透為據，路透以渝報為據，至記者握管之時為止，絕未聞有關方面有何否認之辭；是亦未許多疑矣。夫中國今日所逢之大難，世鮮倫比，謀國主政者，要當以中國歷來對付亂世之政治原則，為應變之根據。如在氏之所為，所以對付之者，應為國族前途計，而絕不瞻徇，予以最嚴厲之制裁。彼逍遙域外，誠為國法所不及，顧三閱月來，道路頻傳，當局對在，固猶有所寬假。是在治亂之道，至多可議，茲不具論；即就懲一儆百之道言之，旣在不容寬假之列；若言杜漸防微，則由來也漸，見微知著，以在精衛其人其職守其歷史，而竟至於出奔主和，則其根性上自有其無所不為之可能，是可逆覩；更得寬假，於是恣肆而至於締約賣國矣。</p>

<p>（倫敦）英海相史丹賀浦伯爵昨夜在英國飛機母艦「阿克勞益爾」號對來賓約千人發言、謂「坎特公爵因喉痛未能與會、尙有若于人今夜亦未能來、因當余將離海軍部時、有發出命令、準備艦隊高射砲之必要也、在來賓登此艦以前、十六架高射砲已可對於來此者予以熱烈之歡迎矣」云、海相之言至此為止、今日首相張伯倫在下院言及此事時、謂史伯爵些言、係偶然而出、並非出於預擬、史伯爵亦未有請報紙特別注意此言之情事、史伯爵不過謂海軍中人有留於艦上準備高射砲者、故未能全體參加昨夜之會耳、在局勢緊張時、準備高射砲、固尋常舉動也、海軍部除通諭雖在特別集會時亦未可稍弛防範外、並未發他種命令、渠恐海相之言、或惹人驚駭、故渠囑報紙勿披露其言、惜渠防免民衆無端騷擾之努力不盡收效、然此事無論如何、已足表明英國海軍時時戒備以防不測矣、（聽者大笑並歡呼）史伯爵事後曾詣相邸說明一切、當無綫電初傳播海相言論後、會引起若干批評、視為驚人事件、其實並無可使人驚駭之理由、渠因此乃囑報紙勿披露之、或視為特殊重大事件云、史伯爵同時亦在上院說明原委、與張伯倫在上院所言者略同、並謂「余之言論、原來在說明英國海軍雖在復活節休假中、亦有防範意外事件之準備、不意竟因此而使首相增多工作、或使他人驚擾、此乃余所抱歉者也云、（五日路透電）</p>

<p>羅京　羅馬尼亞政府昨日將三月十五日以後所徵集之後備兵加以解散、預定十日完成復員、此間政界人士對於此舉、咸表歡迎、認為係表示政局已經和緩、羅匈兩國勘界談判雖尙在進行、但羅馬尼亞似已不懼匈牙利之任何仇視行動矣、（六日海通電）</p>
<p>匈京　匈牙利京城之報章、現皆集中注意倫敦英波談話之發展、希望英國在提出保障羅馬尼亞波蘭領土之公約之際、勿忘大戰之後、有若干匈牙利領土不顧種族原則、被併入羅馬尼亞、倘英國對於此種領土加以保證、則英國地位勢必引起無謂之負担云（六日海通電）</p>

<p>各方仍請維持交通</p>
<p>鎭海口宣布封鎖、禁阻船隻出入後、滬甬航運已於前日下午三時起完全斷絕、滬甬兩地人士、以交通阻斷、影響兩埠商業、及攸關民生者至深月鉅、且甬埠食糧奇缺、向賴外省供給、今一旦封鎖、來源頓絕、民食尤深恐慌、最近甬方曾採辦大宗麥粉、已裝就恩德輪運甬、詎因封江而不克運往、故各關係方面仍擬請求當局、在封鎖期內、准予酌派輪隻、勉維交通、以運輸必要物品、而資調劑、聞寗波商會及航業公會亦正在討論中</p>

<h3 id="c62">特殊情形下　海線　關行政破壞　實施事實有困難者據理呈復　出口稅率悉照政府規定辦理 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>淪陷後之上海江海關、稅務司羅福德迫於環境、在此特殊情形之下、將進口稅率更改、至於出口免稅超過微稅、實係政府獎勵國貨免稅出口之故、茲詰詳情如下</p>
<p>記關免稅超過徵稅</p>
<p>江海關二十七年八月出口徵稅六·三〇〇·六二〇元、免稅一四·八九四·二六三元、九月微稅九·四七四·七七一元、免稅一八·一四五·九八五元、十月徵稅八·二四一·五九八元、免稅一四·六六〇·三〇九元、十一月徵稅一〇·〇二六·六〇〇元、免稅二〇·一九三·八一三元、十二月徵稅一〇·四三五·二五元、免稅一七·五一四·三九九元、二十八年一月徵稅一一·三八四·二四一元、免稅一九·四二二·一八四元、二月微稅一〇·五三一·〇四八元、免稅一八·六四一·五三六元、</p>
<p>特殊情形之下措施</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向海關方面探悉、上海之江海關、自國軍退出上海之後、稅收被截留、改存日商正金銀行、增加日籍關員、被迫易幟、减低進口稅率、名義上雖爲中國之海關、隸屬於總稅務司管轄之下、實際上海關行政、已爲破壊、關於土貨出口、應結外滙、及查禁資日物品、總稅務司梅樂和奉財政部令後、曾飭江海關遵辦、因羅稅務司認爲事實上有困難、當呈復不能遵辦經過、聞已得　稅務司之諒解、</p>
<p>獎勵國貨免稅出口</p>
<p>我國各地海關之出口貨物價値、徵稅均較免稅爲多、惟上海之江海關獨相反、外界頗多不明眞相、但其實江海關之出口稅、戰後並未更改、悉照政府規定之稅率辦理、因上海向爲全國工商業之中心、國貨機製工廠林立、且爲土貨集中出口之處、今政府爲獎勵機製國貨及主要土貨之輸出、均命令准予免稅出口、所以江海關之出口貨、免稅超過微稅、其中免稅貨物、什之七八、爲機製國產貨物、</p>

<p>— 南山</p>
<p>懐念着慶祝國之人瑞馬相老期願壽辰，於昨日下午四時，赴虞治卿路寗波同鄕會參加遙祝，到得會塲，已經座無隙地。百零一齡老翁楊草仙，及虞洽老等都已到齊。在國難中相老遠走西南，這是使前往慶祝的人們，都感到欽佩相老道德文章之偉大；同時也感到誰使我們今天的慶祝，未能與相老共叙一堂！</p>
<p>會塲中間懸着上海難民救濟協會的一魯殿靈光一之綢幛，和鎭江同鄕會的賀聯。百一老翁楊草仙，書法爲海內外所景仰；而其作品，却有三見，一爲難民合作社　賀之榜書壽字，一爲楊老賀聯之「中華國老世界宗師，一爲「一回相見一回老，百壽主人百壽賓，」的紀念聯，書法逍勁，堪稱傑作。</p>
<p>在主席吳蘊齊致祝詞後，楊老繼起祝詞，他誠可稱爲白頭少年，他以一刻鐘的演說而毫無倦容，他最後鄭重說：如果人人以相老爲民族爲國家的精神貢獻社會，那末「誰敢欺我們」？這一句「誰敢欺我們」，楊老是三復斯言，同時也勉勵中國同胞三復斯言，足見楊老是語重心長，足爲靑年楷模。</p>
<p>記者於會塲中曾訪楊老，他雖然壽登百齡以上，而步履如常，耳聰不减當年。據楊氏談；渠較相老僅叨長半齡，蓋相老爲二月生日，而渠則爲七月生日。楊老曾續弦，有三子，次子今年已五十二齡。渠謂渠晨與夜寐，並無定時，飮食亦葷素隨便，對於攝生之術，除徒手操外，亦無其他鍜鍊。渠自海外歸來後，即在滬寓居馬浪路新民邨，渠覺上海空氣，尙可習慣，邇來惟覺聽覺略有不便，但與記者談話時，楊氏精神矍鑠。會塲中曾到有七八十齡之老者十餘人，但其步履健好，似均尙不及楊氏，楊氏鬚髮雖帶白，然較一般八十老翁之鬚髮斑白，尤覺健康。氏衣寬大之中式外氅，不用鈕扣而以衣帶束之，面色略帶紅潤，與人相見，則以九十度之鞠躬相答，道貌謙和，爲昨日會塲中最引人欽仰者。</p>
<p>昨日參加慶祝典禮者，均以壽禮充救濟難民之用，憑收據領取相老親書之壽字紀念章及壽碗壽筷等贈品。集西裝革履之少年，鬚髮斑白之老翁，紅顏靑春之少女於一堂，誠爲上海空前未有之盛况。</p>

<p>[</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>雖然在這美麗的春天，無邊春色，萬紫千紅。雖然在這快樂的春天，卿卿我我，幸福無窮！可是在腎虧的男子，這些，不特沒有他們的份，還要增加他們的春愁春恨，反而怨對春天！這也不能怪：一對健康的夫婦，對此良辰美景，必然情深如海，樂勝于飛，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，融融洽洽，生活是何等的美滿而愉快！反之，一個腎虧的男子，雖有如花美眷，當此月白風淸的春之良宵，夫婦生活，亦必同床而異夢，甚或引起勃谿，愛情破裂，家庭陷於失和的悲慘境地，這豈不是反多了春天嗎？</p>
<p>抑有甚者，腎虧症如遷延不治，每於春暖後症象惡化，凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰痠背痛，滑精漏精，發育不全，精薄不育等症，更相繼併發，則奄奄一息，造成面黃肌瘦，未老先衰，或竟一病嗚呼，早年妖殤，其危機爲何似！</p>
<p>男子所以有腎虧症，據醫家的論斷，大都因早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾與憂勞斵傷，致生殖腺液枯竭之故。所以對症療法，亦唯有用生殖腺補給法爲最特效。此法係由奧國生理學大家斯丹那博士所發明，在臨床實驗上果收却病延年返老還童之效，所以曾震驚於現代醫壇，惟所施手術比較困難，不能普及於大衆，後復由（Jamst）詹姆斯德等大醫師的繼續實驗，乃由雄壯動物如猩猩海狗等體中提取其生殖腺素，用科學方法複製成劑，爲紀念斯氏發明功續起見，即名爲「斯丹那氏生殖素」，藥分男女兩用，可以內服，服法簡便，服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，發揮偉大的效力。若能繼續服用，上述各症必可於短期內完全治愈。更可使體重增加，食慾旺盛，倍增健康。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以同精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。患者如在本埠，能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等各種最新科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3 id="c76">遺精是健康的蟊賊 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>無病便是福，健康實是我們最値得實貴的。可是有許多靑年人每不知利害，以健康爲兒戲。這就是靑年人在春情發動期，因爲性的好奇，初犯自賣，繼起遺精。初患遺精，如果治療得早，尙可無損健康。所最壊的，靑年人對於遺精每不以爲事。致遺精過多，造成積枯血竭。</p>
<p>我人體內的精液，是最主要的內分泌腺，功能調整新陳代謝作用，旺盛發育機能，滋養各部神經。若精枯血竭，新陳代謝作用必然減退，遂致面黃肌瘦，未老先表。發育機能受阻，即呈發育不全，身材低矮，性器短小如指，腦，脊髓，性三大神經衰弱，凡腦衰健忘，失眠頭暈，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散等症更相繼而來，此種靑年，不特健康喪盡，百事無成；就是在人生不可少的傳宗接代的夫婦生活上，亦必不能圓滿而爲妻憎恨！因此，更將陷入人生最悲慘境地！所以遺精靑年應立即覺悟，務求及早幷澈底治療。治療之法，最特效者即服「希米脫氏固精片」。因此藥功能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，使夢幻減少，可得安眠，則遺精自愈。若因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，幷可收延年益壽之效。惟患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用各種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>頭腦較新的現代女性，已放棄了纖纖弱質，重視健康美了。健康美包涵着許多條件。如肌肉的豐盈結實，身體的修短相稱，臀部的豐腴靈活等。但是最主要的一點，却在乳峯。</p>
<p>乳峯貴高聳而有彈性，走動時微微一起一伏，更顯得彈性的豐富，異性們不知不覺被其吸引住，大有飽餐秀色，心不在焉之槪！不過這種美麗的乳峯，祇有健康的女性方會具有。那些身體衰弱，先天不足，月經不調，白帶纏綿的女性，因卵巢內分泌的不足，發育困難，怎能使乳峯高聳：</p>
<p>更有可笑者。有許多乳癟失健的醜陋女子，戴上了乳罩，自欺欺人，可是衣杉單薄，或羅襦甫解之時，這種醜態，總究要立刻顯露出來，所以最聰明的辦法，還是信賴科學的醫學，以謀補救。據世界婦科名醫康德林等與余經試，均一致公認服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效，蓋此劑配製精良，服後於一日夜間，即可培補卯巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，担保能於短期內根治上述各症，而使乳峯高聳，面頰紅潤，化醜陋爲嬌艶。</p>

<p>淋病之患，無人不知其易於傳染，而又爲難以根治者也。而不知淋病根治之事，實非一般人所想象中之難治，因爲一般淋病之所以變成難以根治者，由于患淋病時，私自濫行服用市上成樂，及受一般陳舊機械式的手術，不知淋毒善于變化，病情曲折而微妙，非具有誠實之學問，豐富之經騐，運用最新科學之方法，作精細愼重之診斷不可，旣診斷出病根所在，然後採用最科學方法，作透底之根治，則雖一般醫生所認爲難治之白濁。余決能根本治愈之。</p>
<p>現在直言根治問題的核心，在于醫家如何肯負責治療，病家肯決心受治而已。以醫家對於一般淋病，其最大任務，在於根除病原菌……雙球菌，及由淋毒所產生之毒素而已。一般近視之醫家，其治淋病之方法，不外麻醉神經以止急性淋時之痛苦，及局部手術，以冀尿道表面淋菌之肅淸，不知急性淋時之痛苦，乃生理上抵抗之機能，若用麻醉性之針藥，反而减低本身之抵抗力。至局部療法，充其量亦不過僅在尿道粘膜上驅除若干淋菌而已，決不能剷除深部及血液間的淋菌，至於市上一般成藥，更不足道。今若採用德國據淋平流電療法，則殺菌力旣可透入病灶組織，又濾淸淋毒，蓋僅殺菌而無濾毒之功，則病患將因化學上的變化而不能迅速根治，他如希氏血淸，冷却法，按摩法，自家菌苗之注射等，適症而用，亦爲根治淋病之條件。</p>

<h3 id="c110">有悼 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>除了像馬相伯老先生那樣的壽我們應該慶祝以外，其他就不必。至於一般的賀喜與弔喪，我也以為盡可以等到抗戰勝利後，再來發洩這種哀與樂的感情。這是我昨天所說的話。今天，我再補充一句：在這清明節前後，一般的追悼或祭祀，也盡可以省去，其理由正與現在不必慶，賀，弔一樣。</p>
<p>然而今天，一想着這四月七日的今天，我們却又不能不有所悼，我們不能不追悼一年前的今天，遭敵人的走狗狙擊，因而犧牲性命的劉湛恩博士！他的死，完全是為了國家，為了民族，所以我們是然和他沒有私交，我們却一直紀念他，到了今天，格外要追悼他。他的嘉言懿行，熱腸古道，將永遠為我們的模楷，而他的不配精神更將照耀在抗戰史上，亘古不滅。</p>
<p>我們的追悼他，當然也不是為了他的個人利益，而可惜他的年壽不永，未曾有所享受。他求仁而得仁，又何怨。我們所認為憾事的，是他還沒有到耄耋之年，　而遭難，使國家民族，受到了極大的損失。關於這一點，我們這些後死者，也就應該想想。此後要怎樣的幹下去以竞他的未竞之志呢？</p>
<p>我說：假使我們會踏着劉博士的血跡幹下去的，我們是真的追悼他，積極的追悼他；否則也不過和平常一般，例行公事而已，倒還不如省省的好！</p>
<p>不過為了追悼劉博士，我們就不能不注意到彼方的行為，以及上海的治安。我們時常聽見彼方壓迫租界當局，藉口愛國份孖擾亂租界，向租界當局提出種種要求。而他們自己却怎樣呢？暗釘架綁，是不必說，在他們暴力佔據的區域中，更是烏烟漲天，形成無政府。劉博士的被擊，便是這些事實中的一例，而昨天楊再三的被擊未中，則可以算作最近的一例。這些，他們這些作為，真使人有人間是何世之感！</p>
<p>於今劉博士逝世已經一周年了，他們，在租界上的黑暗手段，只有愈演愈烈，我想賢明的租界當局，總不會聽由他們放肆到底，而不予斷然制裁吧！</p>

<p>— 匡沙</p>
<p>路給水點打成一條泥龍，偃臥著，爬過低低的屋　下，展到盡頭。這條爬蟲的影子消失了，顯出一片荒地——不，現在該說是一座水窪。有些高聳的地方已成了小島，島上建築著破磚和破木片混合的屋子；一股霉蒸潮濕的氣味，和着陰溝裏的污臭，使人難以相信這裏也能居留生命的。</p>
<p>陰澀與苦難的臉壓在雨聲裏，破　之處溜出一雙希望的眼，他瞧著泥路上模糊的足印，他相信哥哥會從泥路上跑回來的。</p>
<p>要是天晴，他也是一個小英雄，他也能夠在蘇州河裏打滾，撈些淌來的菜梗之類的東西；爬在木筏上去剝樹底皮，垃圾桶中撿洋鐵罐頭，偷偷鑽過鐵絲網去拾煤屑。雨來，囚住了他小小的心靈。爸爸是拉洋車的，媽媽呢？到什麽地方去呢？聽說去作工，但是一直沒有回來過。反正，他一入世娘就完了事的，沒有一刻安慰過他，懷抱過他。和哥哥倒是一伙兒的，他離不了哥哥。</p>
<p>不知道天空裏有多少水量，點點不停的下著，要把地面都打破了；泥龍已浸在水裏了，水窪也慢慢的漲到洞口邊。</p>
<p>雨雨雨，夾著沉重的載重的汽車的聲音，隆隆地從鐵絲網外過去；載得高高的貨物，好像一雙威武的野獸，把泥漿濺得高高地。</p>
<p>這些，他記得很切：哥哥的本領能夠追著汽車跑，把裝在車上的大　包很快的戳了一個洞，很快的拉出一堆棉花來。車上的工人豎起一個大拇指來稱讚他：</p>
<p>「好小子。」</p>
<p>一堆棉花賣給小鋪裏頭一個子兒，倘使有機會，他也能夠掙出幾個子兒來。</p>
<p>巡捕來了，哥哥可給皮鞭子括了一下，把生命換來的棉花截去。</p>
<p>「哥哥，我們大了也去當巡捕。」</p>
<p>「不！」哥哥有點憤怒，「誰希罕！我們要做另外的事。」</p>
<p>「我們拉洋車，和爸爸一樣。」</p>
<p>「我不高興——我要去做造路的工人，把所有的泥路都造好。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，我也去，我們把所有的路都造好，把這條泥龍的路造得格外好，和鐵打的一樣，讓我們踏着好走。」</p>
<p>泥龍上被赤着的脚踏過，留出一個痕印來，這印子是深深的，有力的迅速的前展着。</p>
<p>「哥哥！哥哥，你回來啦！」</p>
<p>雨點打在他疏疏的頭髮上。</p>
<h3 id="c112">我的歌 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>

<p>流浪人的氣息</p>
<p>深染在我的身上了。</p>
<p>我不怕風，不怕雨，</p>
<p>不怕冬與寒冷的霜雪。</p>
<p>一陣火，一陣雷，</p>
<p>一陣狂熱，一陣呼號，</p>
<p>燒燃在我的心中；</p>
<p>像燒燃一樣地，</p>
<p>我堅持着，愛那些</p>
<p>流浪的，沒有家的，</p>
<p>憂　的，窮苦的，</p>
<p>給敵人損傷同淩辱的</p>
<p>廣大的同胞們。</p>
<p>在月夜，在白天，</p>
<p>我宣誓着，我呼喊着，</p>
<p>我是真理的友人。</p>
<p>我是強盜的敵人。</p>
<p>我是流浪人，我是</p>
<p>愛正義，愛弱小的人。</p>

<p>「時間」像一條溪流，從此我訴往險惡的急灘，亂石截斷水流，於是舊夢與我隔絕，忘記了平靜的水波，潮平的兩岸，江上的青山，渡頭的恬寂。耳邊喧囂著灘頭的急響，山崖拔地千尋，迴成絕壁，乃阻隔了陽光，四顧蒼茫，我被禁錮在黑暗的深潭中。來自「昔日」，也還黏着消逝的波痕，我用疑問的手撫摩：黑暗的急灘流乃牢牢地封鎖着這一葉輕舟，幽悶，黑暗，而且永遠麽？</p>
<p>「沒有連續不斷的急灘，沒有永遠的險惡，沒有長終的幽囚。」仿佛淩沓嶂之蒼蒼，有人聲在提示我。</p>
<p>彷徨於一絕緣的境界，於一孤島，六月來水國的生涯，像黃昏時褪於帆影的落日。乘一葉輕舟，停滯在急灘頭，犖確的礁石，星羅棋布，隔絕舊日的流水，使我失却溫暖的回憶。即使於這險惡的急灘流，容與亦不可能了。我乃感受着雙鎖的威脅，——時間與空間的幽囚。</p>
<p>悄悄地隱忍着，看落葉躲藏在泥土中，尋溫暖躲藏在被窩中，很明顯的節季又告訴我變更了。枯萎的枝頭，萌芽一二新綠。「該是生長的春天了呵！」衝開輕寒的鎖，拓開生命的活力。春天，生長的季節，我們不能再默默地隱藏了，禁閉於幽囚，侷促於轅下，隱忍於強權，委身於枷鎖，受圍於圈套，聽命於鞭笞。</p>
<p>「春天生長的季節」，蟠動着每一根筋絡像蠶在桑葉上爬。漸漸我感到內蘊的精力有發作的必要，黑色的風，黑色的山，黑色的天，在我的四圍迴繞着熱不可能，於是我將駕起我的輕舟，衝破這險急的灘頭，從礁石中，從瀑湍中，從嗚咽波濤中，從猿啼兩岸中。</p>
<p>誰能忍耐呢！這慘酷的幽囚？沒有自由，沒有徜徉，沒有哭笑，沒有太陽，沒有溫暖，沒有生長。</p>
<p>野哭千家，夷歌幾處，生命的脚跡，輾轉在數尺見方的土垣內，緊接着死亡的邊緣，是那麽近且簡便。赭衣髠鉗的囚徒們，給黑暗寒冷封鎖着，雙目羞明，身體也失常地麻痺。「時間」封鎖著舊日，「時間」亦復斷絕了遠方。</p>
<p>醒來的殘夢，往往不能憑信於枕頭。漏下一段春光來，從石壁之線天。於是我記起：湖上的輕烟，江城的柳絮，花木深深的禪房，採茶時山中的「榖雨」……</p>
<p>當我響往於徜徉的美好時，耳邊復有人提示我：「沒有連續不斷的急灘，沒有永遠的險惡，沒有長終的幽囚。」</p>
<p>於是我——</p>
<p>渡過險惡的灘，渡過湍急的水，渡過深深的潭。黑色的風，黑色的山，黑色的天，擦過兩耳，退向身後。試一移步換形，我乃豁然翠影與紅霞，朝風與旭日。</p>

<h3 id="c116">追念劉湛恩校長 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 林德昭</p>
<p>今天是劉校長遇難的週年紀念。</p>
<p>他的肉體雖然遭受最卑鄙最兇惡的毒手，他生前的美德和偉大的精神，却永遠遺留在我們人間，我們時常想起他的一言一行，作為脚前的明燈，來督察自己，鼓勵自己。</p>
<p>我們的『大家庭』的尊長，雖然為敵人所謀殺，我們成千整萬後輩的學子却絲毫沒有忘記他深刻的教導。他曾說：『滬江與別校不同，我們是一個「大家庭」，我是家長，你們是子弟。我希望我的子弟，思想要革命化，行為要紀律化，碰着最困難的時候，不怕難，不懈怠，並且要拿積極的精神來幹，得到一切的勝利。』</p>
<p>他又曾說：『人生觀要快樂；人們不應有悲觀。一個抱悲觀的人不但對於自己無益，對於社會也是進化中的障礙。我們要守著革命化與紀律化的生活，團結一致，積極奮鬥，犧牲「小我」以成就「大我」，為社會國家服務，謀中華民族的獨立，國際的和平，及人類的幸福。事事由大處着想，小處下手，衝破這惡劣煩悶的環境。我們要竭力鍛練身體，注意心理衛生，養成受得起困苦的體格和精神。』</p>
<p>對於儉樸節約，他以為每逢「九一八」「一二八」等節期，必須素食一天，將省下來的錢捐作救國基金，救濟難民，以及其他慈善事業。</p>
<p>他主張我們要到「民間」「邊疆」去服務，由近而遠，普及教育，使失學兒童婦孺及成人，都能受到最低限度的義務教育。</p>
<p>我們對於他的遺訓，一些都沒有忘記。我們非但沒有忘記，都在照着他的遺訓切實地幹。我們繼續創辦著平民學校，職業學校，婦女補習學校，注意着民眾知識的提高，國家觀念的培養，使每個人都有正常的職業，能夠服務社會，造福人　。</p>
<p>劉校長呀，你逝世一年了。你的人格是全國所尊敬的。我們願你的英靈時常籠罩在你的後輩學子裏，提醒我們，像你生前時一樣，使我們始終的服務國家和社會，　且為你報仇雪恨！</p>
<h3 id="c117">所謂「閒話」 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 笠嵩</p>
<p>杜重遠先生因為「閒話皇帝」嘗到了鐵窗風味，易君左先生因為「閒話揚州」引起了很大的風波，雖然這兩樁事，各有其正面和反面，但由於「閒話」而起却是相同的。易先生的「閒話揚州」，的確有得罪揚州民眾的地方，所以引起了嚴重的訴訟，但杜先生的「閒話皇帝」完全是就事論事，而「友邦」却藉口有辱××，提出交涉，結果，杜先生遭到了獄災，新生被迫停刊。「閒話」誠然有着空間和時間上的困難。</p>
<p>偶然閒暇的時候，約兩三知己，或閒作橘中之戲，或煮茗相互談天，卻是一樁小樂事；現在呢，變了，每個人沒有了閒暇，誰也不能和不願這樣，在這樣的環境中，即使有閑，也難有這樣的興致。</p>
<p>在從前，上海茶館酒肆中，古今中外，不論什麽，可以瞎談「三官經」，沒有什麽關係，如今呢？會來上這麽一個「奉告諸君，勿談時事」；在街頭，國家大事，軍中情形，最好不要上嘴，否則或許會發生什麽「失蹤」的事件。</p>
<p>抗戰以還，的確有不少有閒階級的「閒話」者，他們改變了往常不良的習慣，實地幹起了他們應幹的工作，他們從茶樓上跑下來，踏上了救亡的大道，他們改空言為實幹；但還有一部份「先生」們，仍舊評張議李，滿嘴的救亡求難，但結果是依然十足旁觀的姿態，莫明「閒話」的「時空性」。</p>
<p>最令人痛心的，就是戰前的一般有志氣有作為的熱血青年，他（或她）們看到環境的日趨惡劣，囚之意志消沉，如今他（或她）們有碗話碗，有碟話碟些竟終日到戲院，茶室，或舞場裏「閒話」去了。這樣不但使抗戰的工作，失却了不少幹員，更將使他們墮落而為害於社會！</p>
<p>我以為：會說的人不一定會做，會做的人不一定要說，行而後言是光榮的，言而不行是可恥的；我希望一般「閒話」的人，不要再空口「閒話」啊，在戲院，茶室，或舞場裏的「閒話」，最是不足為訓。告訴你：現在的環境不同了，時勢不同了。</p>

<h3 id="c118">談起馬相伯先生 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>我不免有人生若夢之概，馬先生昨天是百歲誕辰，我應該替馬先生補道　喜。</p>
<p>我曾經在復旦公學讀書，其時復旦公學在吳淞提督行　中，校長即馬相伯先生，教務長為李登輝先生。登輝先生，歸國未久，習於英語，而　於華語，因此幾個教員戲弄他，說中國人應該說中國話，無論何人，倘談話中插入一外國語者，該罰小洋一毛。李先生屢次受罰，諸教員莫不捧腹大笑。其時余已近而立之年，大約為學生中之最老大者，惟僅讀一學期，因生活壓迫，乃輟學而操記者生涯，故余　不敢自絕於先生之桃李門牆，亦不敢自外於先生之桃李門牆也。</p>
<p>余曾聽見過先生一度對於學生畢業演講，他說，學生在本校畢業，不能算學業已成，只能算學業開始，蓋學業原無止境也。學生畢業，譬如得了一把書箱鑰匙，一把書箱鑰匙，不能便算學問，學問尚在書箱之中，還須自己去討案，自己去研求。假定得了鑰匙，自已不去開書箱研究，則學問自學問，畢業自畢業，絕對不相關涉。此種論　，對於一般大學生，一得文　，便志高氣揚，以為莫可世者，真是一針見血之論。</p>
<p>父嘗　教過先生演說方法，他說演與說絕對不能離開，一經離開，便算不得演說，若僅能說而不能演，則無論你說的若何動聽，但死板板立在臺上，決不足以引起聽眾的同情；若僅能演而不能說，便是舞台上一流人物，徒傳聽眾一笑而已。又謂演說動作最雜，便在安置兩手，放前不好，放後又不好，必定欲如音樂隊中之導師，高下疾徐，各諧音節，方始得體，但立的時候演說，安置兩手已難，而坐的時候演說，兩手更不易滑落，故演說家須有真實的學問，與自然的姿態，二者缺一不可也。</p>
<p>光緒末年，（或在宣統初年）滬上各報館，曾在張氏味　園開過一　親會，請小連生演劇，馬相伯先生演說，其時被邀者尚有王敬芳先生，與老牌漢奸鄭孝胥等。馬先生踏上演臺，一手向後，一手指東北而言曰，余遠遠見一片烏雲，此烏雲即指滿清政府而言，蓋其時排滿思想，異常劇烈，滿清政府，亦邏輯黨人甚嚴，而先生竟作公開的排滿言論，莫不深為敬佩。先生以下演辭，余雖已不能記憶，但觀其言語動作，及面部表演，能令聽眾喜，能令聽眾怒，能令聽眾擊掌高呼，或潛然淚下，其感動魔力有如此。小連生演劇，劇名為「潘烈士投海」，小連生化裝一出洋留學生，作慷慨激昂之演說，聽者莫不鼓掌，故其時有小連生做戲似演說，馬相伯演說似做戲之語。</p>
<p>我聽見演說多矣，無有如馬相伯先生者，或能演而不能說，或能說而不能演，或竟演與說俱不能者，如侯官嚴又陵先生，學問淵博，識見宏通，固無待論，而聽其演說，大有使人昏昏欲睡之概，即老牌漢奸鄭孝胥，亦口吃，幾使人掩耳而走，而聽馬相伯之演說，竟有使人不知肉味之歡，馬先生之學問，博大精深，余雖莫能窺其底蘊，嘗聽其對學生講，諸位每天識二十許個英文生字，尚不能記憶，余，（先生自稱）從前每日須讀一二百生字，遊刃有餘，此雖似言之過誇，但先生精於　丁文字，則英文自易解釋，此非不可能之事也。故先生既為當代教育大家，亦為當代演說大家，固一時無兩也。</p>
<p>今談起馬相伯先生，而勾引起我三十年前，對於馬相伯之言論丰采，依然如在目前，故拉雜書之若此。</p>
<h3 id="c119">寫在劉湛恩先生逝世一週年 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>時光是快的，劉湛恩先生逝世已經一年了。</p>
<p>劉先生的被暴徒槍擊身死，那是象徵著中國的文化人在「孤島」被摧殘的陰影的。中國的文化人決不會對暴力屈服，那在歷史上有許多例子，而劉先生遭難後的一年來，「孤島」的文化人更用鐵一樣的事實來答復了它。</p>
<p>自然，劉先生的遭難，即以他個人來說，那對祖國的抗戰，對「孤島」文化運動的開展推動，也是一種很大的損失。而租界內治安的時常被攪亂，日人屢次企圖控制租界所提出的藉口，所謂「恐怖份子」的活躍，是怎樣一會事，也不難從此得到一點端倪。我們相信租界內有幾件暗殺事件，　也許是我們的熱烈份子幹的，但這些無恥漢奸的被殺，却不會盡是出於此　子之手，中間盡可能是漢奸為了分贓不勻而起的內　，或者是「狡兔死，走狗烹」；而另外一種從橋北來的恐怖，則即是以我們的文化人為目標，如劉湛恩先生的遭難。</p>
<p>而我們如果再回想一下恐怖案的始作俑者是誰，張貼着「看看看」的告白者是誰，送手臂，毒水果者是誰，也是不難明了的。</p>
<p>我們非常關心租界的治安，更擁戴租界中立的態度，也因之，我們認為，租界當局應澈底根絕恐怖案的源由，不然，刻舟求劍，結果還是徒勞無功，而危害租界治安的兇　，也必日益高漲，烟賭的毒禍大有從越界築路區蔓延進租界來，便是一例。</p>
<p>而我們的紀念劉先生呢，空口白話是不必的，衷悼憑吊固然不能自己，但這些應該放在其次。最好的紀念是行動，尤其是在最後勝利，越來越近，而敵人的兇　也勢必日益加甚的現在，我們反躬自省一下看：在這一年中，我們做了多少工作，堪以告慰劉先生於泉下，堪以對得起自己家國的？</p>
<h3 id="c120">「小鬼」在西北　他們担任掌號·送信·伙夫·雜差等項工作 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 卡蒙譯自密勒氏評論報</p>
<p>兩萬以上無家可歸的中國流亡兒童，來自中國各地，在西北加入了第八路軍，對日作戰。這些孩子的年齡，大半在十一歲以上，十六歲以下，所以拿軍器還嫌太小，可是他們會擔任掌號，送信，伙夫，演劇，雜差等工作。一般的人都把這些孩子稱做「小鬼」。在每一個軍營裏，他們最是快樂，他們穿著雜色的棄去的軍服，時常會弄成三式，而獲得的糧餉，和正規軍隊一樣——每月法幣一元。一個被太陽晒黑了面孔的孩子對人說，做一個「小鬼」，比在日本佔領區內做一個田野裏的餓鬼有趣得多。他十二歲就離開家鄉，加入朱德將軍統率的軍隊，現在這個孩子已被一般的人認為非常重要，因為在第八路軍的總司令部，祗有他是准許守崗。這些孩子裏面，受過教育的不多，可是加入了第八路軍，每天早上要受識字教育的。</p>
<p>他們以耐得勞苦著聞，一個十四歲的孩子，跟在一隊騎在馬上的軍官後面，有過一天，走了四十三英里路。到了晚上九點鍾，營是紮好了，他還是像松鼠一樣，吱哩吱哩的在替軍官預備床鋪。</p>
<p>這些孩子，到了晚上，每是坐在一起，很誠摯的討論白天打教師那邊聽得來的關於軍事學或是政事科學上的各個問題。</p>
<p>在每一個軍營裏，「小鬼」有他們自己的軍事組織，並選舉他們自己的長官。他們宣誓遵守的一種榮譽的法紀，是和美國的童子軍相仿的。</p>
<p>幾百個孩子，在內戰時老早就加入紅軍的，現在都是第八路軍中的長官了　「小鬼」經過了軍事訓練之後，在戰鬥力的裏面，是最足信任的一種質素。這原因，指揮軍事的長官，每是在他們的裏面，選出自己的衛隊的。</p>
<p>除了「小鬼」之外，第八路軍裏面，還有幾千中國青年，男女都有，由全國各地的中等學校和專科學校中徵募得來。現在，他們在中國防线的后面，担任各種救濟工作。在戰地上面，自前线到後方，設有幾百個服務站。這些青年，都是三民主義青年團的團員。服務站的裏面，有醫藥設備，圖書，雜誌，廠房，鍋　，用具，少數米糧和開水。在服務站上工作的青年，有好多自己承認，他們為了要對戰事盡些責任，才背了人打家裏逃出來的。（下略）</p>
<h3 id="c121">「比翼雙飛」觀後 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Sweethearts”　米高美出品</p>
<p>當你看到泰羅鮑華和安娜蓓拉的戀愛被公司當局所干涉的時候，你不是表示絕大的憤慨嗎？真的，在好萊塢，一位演員獻身銀幕之後，與其說為了「藝　」，還不如說為了「公司」。當你尚未成名的時候，當局會惟恐或矢地為你製造機會，你的一舉一動，或是喜歡吃沙丁魚，穿綠顔色的衣裳，甚至是一個莫明其妙的羅曼斯，都是絕妙的宣傳資料。然而等到你一成名，你的合同上會有「幾年之內不准結婚」的條件都開在里面，泰羅鮑華和安娜蓓拉的戀愛被公司當局所干涉，這消息如果不是反宣傳，你能說為了「公司」之外還有其他的理由嗎？</p>
<p>所以，我覺得「比翼雙飛」的劇作者是相當天真可愛的，他告訴我們這樣一個故事：『百老匯有一位劇作家為着一種特殊的關係，拆開了一對比翼的愛侶。他的計劃是想使一個妻子相信她的丈夫和她們的女書記發生了戀愛。他派人把丈夫寫給妻孖的情書偷了出來，把它放進劇詞里，讓妻子相信丈夫也有一封同樣的信寫給了那位女書記。』所謂「一種特殊的關係」、就是和這對夫婦的監製人發生利害衝突是也。不過劇作者也顯示了他的聰明，這對夫婦是百老匯的舞臺名伶，因為好萊塢電影公司的聘請，才想出這計劃來使他們不能到好萊塢去。可是就為了劇作者的聰明，又告訴了我們好萊塢和百老匯之間有著爭聘名角的暗　。</p>
<p>「比翼雙飛」是珍妮麥唐納和奈爾遜　第的第一部五彩片。因為是五彩片，導演者范達克氏在服裝，襯景，道具上，都盡了　皇富麗，清幽和諧的能事。如一開場的三幕歌劇，第一場荷蘭農歌的　索優美；第二場「愛的命運」的鮮豔奪目；第三場「比翼雙飛」的和諧美麗，不但此也，即是每一場，導演在色素的配合上，都是非常謹慎從事的。珍妮麥唐納在化妝室中穿了鮮豔的襯衣，對鏡下裝的時候，那色彩不但更顯出了麥唐納的美麗，看著的時候也覺得非常舒服。還有麥唐納的時裝表演，這果然介紹了好萊塢流行的新裝束，但何嘗不是顯示彩色片的功能呢。</p>
<p>你看過「絕代豔後」嗎？你被範達克卓越的手腕所感動嗎？（那是寫曼麗安東妮的一生，不是寫法國革命史）但「比翼雙飛」是一個喜劇，他是一反那種深刻動人的細膩描寫，全片始終在輕快的旋律中發展，一直到終場。我特別愛好的是在麥唐納聽了劇作家的新劇本的那場戲：他們夫婦在整裝待發的時候，由於這位劇作家的出現而破壞了，這場戲利用音樂來襯托麥唐納的心理狀態，是非常可愛的，特別是織接。</p>
<p>你不是喜歡「柔腸九廻」中的羅倫揚嗎，那末，這裏飾演監製人斐立斯李門的佛蘭摩根也同樣可愛。</p>

<p>第七回　乳燕新鶯影聯雙璧　越羅吳錦機織七襄</p>
<p>何先生信中所說的，什麽呌生貨，什麽呌熟貨呢？原來那些農産品，沒有制成什麽物品的，稱之為生貨。一向人家以為中國是個農業國家，原料的生産地，所出的都是生貨。像生絲那件東西，雖然是中國的大宗出口貨，而且從養蠶以及繅絲，其中也要經過許多手續，有專門家的研究，有科學家的發明。然而說起來，還是屬於生貨。必定要染成各種顔色，織成各種絲綢，方算是熟貨了。所謂工業國與農業國的分別，就是一個出的是熟貨，一個出的是生貨。現在新年興的中國，正在由農業國，漸漸的轉到了工業國去的時候。因此何先生寫信給兩位小姐，創辦織綢廠，銷到國外去，就是努力於熟貨的意思。兩位小姐收到了她們老太爺的信以後，也很為興奮。她們本來正躊躇於自己職業的前途，現在何先生這封信，好像是領了她們一條路了。她們在廣東家裏的時候，倒也不感覺的什麽，悠悠忽忽，從回國以後，差不多兩年過去了。雖口說謀職業，因為是資産階級的小姐，好似安富尊榮慣了的。現在到了安樂鎮，瞧著她們都是忙於職業，沒有一天，可以空閑的。而她們兩人，　閑無事，似乎古人所說的，「飽食終日，無所用心，」似乎覺得不好意思。一個人生在世上，無論是男是女，不是靠著祖父的餘蔭，有了幾個臭銅錢，就可以安度一生　。既然如此，我們何必在外國從事什麽學業？而且又何必學什麽工業呢？她們兩人本來自己在嗟歎，又背著人在商量，覺得空閑一無所事，要被人談論恥笑。今天接到了這封信，她們以為朱愛人是好朋友，不能不告訴她。而且倘使要　什麽　　廠，就得開在江浙兩省之間，也許就在這裏相地為宜，尤其不能不與愛人商量，要請他幫忙咧。那一天晚上，何家姊妹便把這話給朱愛人談了。愛人笑道：「你們要辦一個醫院，那末我可以供獻你許多計謀。現在你們要辦紡織廠，我可是一竅兒不通，這豈不是問道於直嗎？不過我有一個願望，願你們將來的紡織廠，然　在此地。不是安樂鎮，就是自由村最好。」（八○）</p>

<p>舊金山上船不愼傷膝　現在香港正杜門養息</p>
<p>黃柳霜的妹妹黃英（Wong　Ying）小姐，在「愛斯基摩」名片中任過重要的女角，她的名望和地位，雖比不上她的姊姊，但也有相當的名聲，她最近偕同兩位親屬，自美國乘船返歸祖國，到香港省親，因此引起了港地影迷的注意。</p>
<p>她在舊金山上船的那一天，不愼而傷膝，直至抵達香港，膝傷還未吿痊，所以她在船上，一路祇好蟄居艙中，覺得這次出門不利。</p>
<p>據她在香港對西報記者談，她當主演「愛斯基摩」一片時，曾在北美洲極北部寒冷的阿拉司加，住了足足八個月，她在這個時期內，雖然曾數次墮落冰穴中，都沒受傷過，她又會遇見一頭吃人的狗熊，亦未被傷毫末，但這次在一艘極新式的郵船上，船還沒有行動，她竟在吊梯上行走的當兒，立足不穩，滑下四級，膝部便因此受傷，實在認爲不幸，她現在港地杜門養息中，所以不多接見賓客。</p>
<p>又據她說：在好萊塢的許多華籍的電影工作人員，對于祖國的抗戰情形，一直是關心着，每遇到由中國寄去的戰事膠片，當在黑房裏洗印的時候，總是擠滿了這些關心祖國抗戰者，雖然這種行爲，是被公司當局禁止着的，但他們也抱着同情于中國，　于他們「先覩爲快」的熱情，也就十分原諒。</p>
<p>黃英女士于近十年來，曾在好萊塢各影片公司參加拍戲工作，如她姐姐一樣的，美國加里福尼亞州，是她的誕生地。她的父親現年已七十有八，她的祖鄕是廣東，這是她有生以來還歸祖國的第一次，可惜祖國現正遭受着不幸，這在黃女士的心中一定是非常悵惘的吧。</p>

<p>遜淸大內之演劇戲台，自推頤和園中爲最偉大，茲篇所紀壽安宮戲台，規模亦復不小，蓋該台建於乾隆二十五年，値淸代鼎盛之時，爲皇太后七旬萬壽所特建也。</p>
<p>該台位處故宮外西路慈寗宮之後，係咸安宮舊址，乾隆十六年，改稱「壽安宮」，宮內有殿曰「春禧」，殿後即爲戲台，台凡三層，四面各顯三間，扮戲樓一座，計五間，東西轉角樓房二座，計三十二間，此其建築之大槪也。</p>

<p>該台建築費，見於內務府典册者，略謂「油飾彩畫糊裱，出運渣土，拉運物料等項工程，除銀硃，苧布，杉木，銅錫，紗絹，高麗紙，向該處行取應用外，所有買辦木石磚灰，琉璃瓦料，紅土繩蔴，釘鐵雜料，給發各工匠工價，通共約需銀八萬五千三百九十四兩八錢八分五厘，內除本工，拆得舊木石磚塊琉璃瓦料，抵銀九千八百三十七兩三錢五分八厘外，凈需銀七萬五千五百五十七兩五錢二分七厘」。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>明朝右都御史却會判斷元代的冤案</p>
<p>我常說皮黃劇實在太可憐了！假使我們要仔細檢討一下，就可知道它有許多脚本都是從崑曲·秦腔·漢調等翻下來的。從前翻的時候，還能與本來面目，無甚差別，除了音樂·唱腔·劇詞等的不同之外，至於劇情及朝代的先後，是決不會弄錯的。及至晚近伶人翻出戲來，不知怎的却常會把原來的情節變的亂七八糟，有時候竟將數百年後的人搬了出來，硬呌他審理民間一件寃案，不但是張三的帽子扣在李四頭上不大合適，並且這種掠人之美的卑劣行徑，我想宋朝的句孝肅同明代的海汝賢（名瑞。自號剛峯先生。）一定也不願作的。現在有一齣很盛行的旦角戲，却就犯了這個毛病。倘使我們再不來糾正一下，恐怕愈演愈糟，假若電影公司裏因爲這齣戲號召力的强大，也像「木蘭從軍」「楚覇王」似的，攝成電影，甚至運到國外映演，那未，這個臉面可丟大啦。因爲歐美的劇藝家是最着重考查劇本的時代的，我們本國人要連一本戲的朝代都弄不淸楚，豈不是大大的笑話麽。所以區區特爲把這齣風行一時的名劇寫了出來，同時把它的錯誤之點，舉而出之，來與戲戲同志共同硏究一下，希望大家不要因爲它是某名伶的成名劇，就懐着一種顧忌的心理。要知我們這種深切的硏究，全是爲着整個戲劇的改進，這才是眞正的愛護劇藝呢。</p>
<p>「六月雪」一名「羊肚湯」，又名「金鎖記」，這齣獻我曾見某名旦演過幾次，其說明書略謂「明萬曆（曆誤作歷）間，蔡御史之子蔡昌宗，娶竇尙書之女竇娥爲妻，用余鎖爲定禮，故名余鎖記。本爲崑曲翻改亂彈，（亂彈即皮黃別名）此劇自蔡昌宗別家赴考，中途爲僕人張驢兒推落淮河，蔡老夫人聞訊哀痛，病中想吃羊肚湯，張驢兒在楊中置毒，蔡夫人未食，驢兒之母張媽媽食之，中毒身死。驢兒欲覇佔竇娥爲妻，借屍圖詐，拉蔡母到公堂受刑不過，竇娥替姑認罪定了斬刑，因其孝義感動天心，故而六月下雪，巡案海瑞昭雪寃情，驢兄正法，竇娥旌表，昌宗遇救，得中狀元，回家團圓。」</p>
<h3 id="c127">「楊貴妃」體胖增憂　胡蝶厲行减瘦術 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 銀絲</p>
<p>行將開始攝片工作　現正忙於服藥打針</p>
<p>胡蝶女士前於歐遊歸國以後，曾爲嬌軀發胖日甚，苗條體態，漸見臃睡，頗損美觀，因常對鏡蹙額，引爲一大隱憂。彼時爲此，問醫求治，力謀减瘦；一度摒絕肉類滋養品及戒食米粒，改將麵包蔬果之類用資果腹。這樣歷經數月，力行勿懈，固屬不無微效。後來忽爲小產致疾，久住醫院，潛心調治，每天常服牛乳及其他補品甚多；迨經病體吿痊，回復康健；不但前功盡棄，且復體重有加因此耗費了很多心機，結果仍不免於盡付東流。此後，她爲勤習運動亦係减瘦一法，更兼習爲常課，較易持久；除在膠州路宅前曠地，闢爲網球塲，和她「外子」潘郞，每天「夫唱婦隨」地用作消遣外，又復請了一位拳師，很勤奮的在每天早晨，從事「十二潭腿」的練習。胡女士這般「苦心孤詣」，雖則未見怎樣的大效，但在實際上已保持原來狀態，並沒再見「竿頭日進」現象，而她亦很覺深自欣慰了。惟在戰後遷居香島，久度「寓公」生活的很悠閒的情形之下，芳容日見豐腴，又早較前發福不少。新華公司請她主演的「楊貴妃」苦裝影片，本來早定將去香港拍演，張善琨爲了業務繁劇，無法分身因以延遲下來，現在决俟過了十三號乃翁壽反之後，便須率領攝影隊離滬南行。胡女士演這片子，原是人劇相宜，正足表現環肥之美見得更爲太眞生色的；她却小心翼翼，多慮過甚，近來因又請了醫生在忙着打針，服藥，謀作速效的减瘦。其實，胡女士的丯姿，現在依然是那麼很美麗的，即使飾演其他角色，亦復只須化妝得法，在銀幕上也決不會眞使觀衆對她發生「太胖了」的感覺。富於愛美觀念，雖是一般女子的特性，而向以美麗見稱的胡女士，則又顯見更較她人爲甚，差不多竟把它當作第二生命的樣子了！</p>

<p>— 海生</p>
<p>慶祝馬相伯老人百齡大壽的平劇播音，前天假座大陸電台舉行，從中午十二時開始，名票和名伶都漸漸地聚集在電台上，担任報吿的仍是江一秋，王本善，孫蘭亭，在其俊幾位。下午共舞台藝員趙松樵，李雪舫，錢麟童，趙君艷，沈艷琴，李秀英等由後台經理陳月樓，管事陸文儀率領，自動到電台報到，熱心良堪欽佩。</p>
<p>晚間李子洋和我担任接角，於是各舞台，戲院的名角都紛紛的到了，素來不常參加播音的周信芳，也翩然偕高百歲同　，聽衆紛紛點他唱文素臣的很多，百歲笑着說：「這本戲唱了兩個多月，還聽不够嗎？」票界江一秋的這齣戲也很有號召力的。</p>
<p>有一件使大家認爲遺憾的事，就是天蟾舞台的台柱黃桂秋，因接到的信上，誤稱他爲女士，就拒絕參加，爲了救濟難民，似乎不該這樣認眞，况且報上的廣吿是稱他「先生」的</p>
<p>影星參加的祇有顧梅君，蘭君，姊妹，蘭君向聽衆致祝詞並道謝，梅君唱了一齣汾河灣的靑衣，陳鶴峯唱了一叚八百八年，名票吳江楓和小丑韓金奎合唱百壽圖，都可以說是善頌善祝，韓金奎的「小犬」小奎唱了一叚御菓園，這孩子的戲更有進步了。</p>
<p>熱心慈善的票伶們，直播到昨晨三點多鐘才散，成績很好，聽衆親到電台去買壽碗和紀念章的，也有三百多元呢。</p>

<p>— 張懷霖</p>
<p>二月春筍枸杞頭，是一樣上品的菜餚，雖然枸杞頭稍帶苦味，也不因此而遜色，枸杞頭不但滋味好，而且有很大的益處；藥中用的甘杞子，就是枸杞實，地骨皮就是枸杞根，功能清火養肝。</p>
<p>杞子的功效很大，枸杞頭的功用也不少，枸杞在南方是三四尺長的藤類灌木，在甘肅寗夏一帶，高大成樹，不亞於參天的松柏，所以北方吃的枸杞頭，好像我們吃的香椿頭，一年衹有極少的幾天，能夠採以佐盤餐，一眨眼就要錯過機會的；南方的枸杞低小，氣候和平，所以枸杞頭約有三十四天可採。採摘時要揀新茁的嫩芽，而是肥壯的。摘下似花蕊樣約半寸餘的一支苗頭，這樣的商了三四十個，再加二三寸長短的嫩春筍，就可以做一碗鮮美可口的菜餚。</p>
<p>枸杞頭又名天精草，與杞子的功效相同，能清解血分的熱毒，少生瘡癤。</p>
<h3 id="c156">痧子氣急鼻煽時期　病情原因及食養 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>氣之出入，乃吐故納新之作用也，通常名之曰呼吸，大人之呼吸，每分鐘十六次至十八次，小人之呼吸，每分鐘約三十次左右。呼吸之次數，除特別少或特別多外，普通於診斷上不甚注意之，實際上亦無注意之必要，一般醫家之診病，若非所遇者為重篤之險症，鮮有默計其呼吸之次數者。</p>
<p>一症，大多以感冒為誘因，而與呼吸器病併發，故最易影響於呼吸。小兒之患痧子者，若熱度過高，往往引起心臟之衰弱，血液不能充分入肺，血中炭酸加增，呼吸中樞異常興奮，呼吸次數加增，每分鐘竟多至四十或四十次以上，成為氣急之象，同時鼻翼亦見煽動。</p>
<p>氣急鼻煽之原因，除高熱而外，厥為氣管支炎或肺炎。患砂子之小兒，咳嗽頻作，氣管本有炎性狀態，症之劇者，則轉為氣管支炎或肺炎，因發炎而分泌之痰濁加多，或則充塞氣管，或則末端之肺胞，亦無間隙，呼吸之道旣阻，呼入肺內之空氣即減少，肺部血液中這炭酸氣亦加多，因之氣急而鼻煽，氣急鼻煽，見於患痧子之小兒，為最危險之證候，亟宜求醫服藥，不可忽視，稍一延誤，即有痙厥或窒息之變，致陷於不可救藥之地。</p>
<p>至於飲食一項，在證情器盛而緊張之時，已無暇顧及，蓋患者之食欲慾，已形停頓，旣不思飲食，而此種危險之氣急鼻煽，端非飲食一事，可以為之排除，故飲食與氣急鼻煽之關係，少有人談及之者。以余之所知，胃與肺其地位鄰近，當氣急鼻煽證清未甚之時，食慾未退者，不宜地飽，以免多食胃膨，壓迫肺葉，使呼吸蒙其不利。試觀吾人於狼呑大嚼之後，每覺胸中滿悶，呼吸不舒，即此可以為證。痧子初起，清涼之品，固在禁例，然亦有從權達變者，如熱甚而痧子不易透達，往往有氣急之象，其舌苔白者，醫治之法，以麻黃石膏為主，舌質光綘者，以鮮生地豆鼓為主。用藥不廢清涼，飲食一項，亦當相機從事，如熱度過高，不妨酌用清涼飲料，地栗湯橘子汁，蔗漿等，皆可採用，惟當適可而止，切忌恣飲過度。熱高而其勢不十分熾盛者，涼品熱飲，可以略加溫度而服之，則流弊較少。迨痧子透齊，或痧子將回，熱尚未退，且因熱甚而氣急者，舌質必綘，用藥以大劑甘寒養陰，如鮮生地，鮮石斛，麥冬，蘆根之類，故橘子汁與蔗漿等，僅可放膽與服，養陰而清熱，不必平氣宣肺，氣急可以自退。若高熱久持，心臟已陷於衰弱境地，用藥以附子，黑錫丹等強心為主，幸而飲食能進者，旣不可多食，又當求其味之沖淡而談聲　　，阻於喉四，竹瀝內加生　汁與服，使其緩緩瀉下，從大便排出之，痰多氣急，搗　萄取汁，加溫服之，事起倉平，病清之突然生變者，亦足資救急之用也。</p>

<p>豆之種類甚多，功用各異。略述如下：</p>

<p>青大豆　清肝養胃，嫩時剝而為肴，味極適口；鹽水煮而烘之，可以久藏致遠。</p>
<p>黑大豆　補脾腎，袪風邪，善解諸毒，其皮入藥，能止盜汗。大豆黃卷，即黑大豆為藥也，治濕痺，消水脹滿。</p>
<p>赤豆　行水退腫，可消腳氣。以緊小而赤黯色者入藥。</p>
<p>豆　煮食清膽養胃，解署止渴，利小便，醒酒。浸罨發芽，摘根為蔬，味極清美。</p>
<p>豆　嫩時剝為蔬僎，味甚鮮美，浸以發芽，不致壅滯。</p>
<p>扁豆　以白者為勝。健脾止瀉。</p>

<p>婦人有孕後，飲食最宜注意。有宜食者：如姙娠一月，喜食酸羹，宜食麵品。二月，喜食甘甜，宜食肉類。三月四月，宜食軟飯，菜蔬魚羹。五月六月，宜食濃厚之品，調和五味，毋使太飽。七月八月，宜常食豆乳腐衣之屬，以潤其腑，以堅其骨。九月十月，飲食宜調，稍進糖果，以養脾胃。有忌食者：一忌食糯米，令子生蟲；二忌犬肉，令子成啞；三忌食兔肉，令子缺唇。其他如　肉，雀肉，螃蟹，生姜，茨茹，無鱗之魚等，均不宜食。各種菌類，令人驚風，有孕之後，勿亂服藥，勿過飲酒，勿舉重登高，勿過逸臥睡，衣毋大溫，食毋太飽，尤為要也</p>

<p>— 缶鳴</p>
<p>近日天氣寒暖不一，感冒症流行一時；傷風該咳嗽，無處無之，而隨地吐痰之風乃益熾。有識之士發起反吐痰運動，固屬要着，然若患傷風咳嗽之人能及早治愈，則反吐痰運動之推行，必可更易收效矣。爰介紹麻黃梨一味如次：</p>
<p>原料　較大之生梨一只，麻黃二分，川貝粉二錢，冰糖二錢。</p>
<p>製法　先將生梨洗淨，用刀切下其頂，再用銅匙或小刀挖去其核，以川貝粉冰糖共置其中，再將切下之梨頂蓋上，以麻黃作栓，逐一插牢，使梨頂與梨連合，然後放入碗中，置飯鏤蒸之，蒸熟後，將麻黃拔去，餘下碗中之汁及梨均可恣食，味極可口，雖小孩亦必樂啖之。</p>
<p>功效　梨能潤肺，消痰，降火；麻黃能袪風，宣肺，平喘：川貝粉能宣肺　，止嗽，化痰；白冰糖能潤肺，生津，化痰：合而用之，則相得益彰矣。故於傷風咳嗽等症，確具特效，自絕無流弊。</p>

<p>（二）一切痛，忌食豬脂，濕麵，羊，膩滯，煎炒等物；犯之復發難治。</p>
<p>（三）中風後，忌服豬，羊，鵝，雞，魚腥，芋，蛋，滯氣，發病等物。</p>
<p>（四）勞嗽發熱，水腫喘急，宜淡食，忌鹽物。</p>
<p>（五）瘡痢後，忌飽食，及生冷香甜滑利諸血之物。</p>

<p>— 秦伯未</p>
<p>十二粥　粥類滋潤而易消化，病人宜之，脾胃薄弱者亦宜之。通常均以白粳熬煮，病中輒用鍋巴，取其芳香而不滯。但於病後滋養缺乏，不如用秫米，除中塞者外，均甚相宜，且能清肺中諸藥不能清之餘熱。故時病之後，莫妙於此。又大麥米粥能寬中下氣，栗米粥調養脾胃，百病不忌。若求補力增進，則就粳米粥中加蓮子粉，或芡實粉或山藥粉，能益氣健中，固精關，止久泄，或酌加燕窩、海參、雞鴨牛羊等汁，能補陰陽之虧損，精血之虛之。聞市攤所售之粥，有和以些須之石灰者，取其味甘性粘，不免溫熱，令人乾渴吐　。特寒潔作脹，腹中窄狹者，暫食頗佳，蓋即書所稱石灰粥是也。</p>
<p>十三·牛乳　牛乳脂肪蛋白質甚富，為營養佳品，近多用充病人之食料。</p>
<p>十四·麵包與麥片　麵包以小麥粉加酵母焙製，質鬆易化，滋養料不亞於米飯，為歐美之主要食品。近來國人之患腸胃病者，亦多采以充飢，麥片即取麥粒連　皮壓扁而成，含有　素，　素係蛋白質屬，小麥中約含百分之十，故亦有滋養之效，病人煮食，殊鮮流弊（完）</p>

<p>附子氣味辛甘大熟，功能溫經助陽，祛寒逐濕，牛肉氣味甘溫和平，功能健脾壯氣，暖胃調中，兩味合煎濃汁，乃為辛甘而溫之氣味，用以調補陽虛胃寒之病人，頗為適合。舊患陽虛胃寒症者每逢冬令進補膏方及丸劑均不相宜，惟有附子牛肉同煮，旣補又能壯陽，溫中，兼能散寒。試服一冬，則明春肢冷形寒之症，即可悉除，胃納亦必大增。此方可用附子五錢至二兩，牛肉若干。附子當用黃厚附扯，因性味較黑附為較綏。而無動血助熟之患；牛肉當取黃淨牛肉，因補力較水牛為大，且有溫中益氣之能也。</p>

However, the Chinese army did not continue to attack into the city due to lack of reinforcements. The Japanese side in Guangzhou admitted that the Chinese guerrilla attack was completely unexpected, resulting in significant losses for the Japanese, because the rainy season had begun in Guangdong Province, and the Japanese did not expect the Chinese army to take advantage of the heavy rain to launch an attack.

<p>(Chongqing) Today's Xinhua Daily editorial urges the authorities to not only pursue and arrest Wang Jingwei and his remaining followers in Hong Kong and Hanoi, but also to arrest pro-Wang elements at all levels of the government. It states that only by thoroughly eradicating such elements can the war of resistance achieve final victory.

<p>(Hong Kong) Moscow Dispatch: Soviet newspapers have been paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese war situation recently. Authoritative sources in Moscow have stated that the retreat from Nanchang has no significant impact on China's military. The heroic fighting of Chinese soldiers near Nanchang reaffirms the Chinese nation's will and its government's determination to resist foreign aggression. Since the occupation of Guangzhou and the retreat from Hankou, the Japanese have been at a standstill. If the Japanese army advances further, it will encounter even stronger resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese warlords' objective in attacking Nanchang was to boost domestic morale, attempting to use a new military "victory" to quell domestic dissatisfaction with the warlords. The price the Japanese paid for this "victory" was the 30,000 soldiers killed and wounded near Nanchang. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation: March 30 to April 5 <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission stated that the war situation this week (March 30 to April 5) was more active than last week. In the battle in northern Jiangxi last week, although our army in Nanchang made a strategic shift, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and their elite forces were completely wiped out. Their conspiracy to make a last desperate gamble was completely shattered by us. Although the enemy troops on various fronts deliberately appeared rampant, they were met with a head-on blow by our loyal and brave soldiers, launching a large-scale attack, causing them to flee in panic and sink further into the quagmire. The general summary of the process is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: There were no changes on the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Sanshui lines. Over 2,000 enemy troops and over 20 tanks advancing from Jiujiang, supported by aircraft and poison gas, were personally commanded by the enemy commander Zhizhisong Di, launching a fierce offensive. This week, they repeatedly engaged our army in fierce battles in Huangmaikeng, Zhuangyuan Mountain, and other places. At the same time, enemy troops landed from Beijie, converging on Jiangmen in a two-pronged attack, attempting to realize their delusion of breaking through Zhongshan. On March 31, Shaping, Beijie, and Jiangmen were once lost. Subsequently, our army displayed its spirit, launching a large-scale counter-offensive, completely defeating the enemy, killing over 1,500. Enemy commander Zhizhisong and commander Zhimu were also killed. The remnants retreated to Jiujiang. There are still several hundred remaining enemy troops, and they are being swept away continuously, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all. On the southern route, enemy warships on the Fangcheng sea, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, landed in Qisha on March 31. After being bombarded by our teams, the enemy abandoned over two hundred bodies and fled back to the ships. The sea is currently calm. On the same day, several hundred enemy troops from Ding'an on Hainan Island, accompanied by several tanks, advanced towards Chidi via Leimingshi, encountering strong resistance from our army. After five hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand the pressure and retreated to Ding'an.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Front: Our army abandoned Nanchang and Wuning this week to engage in an encirclement of the enemy. After suffering losses, the enemy's fierce offensive was thwarted. From the 1st, our army launched a full-scale counter-offensive. The enemy in the Nanchang area was consistently blocked by us north of Liantang and made no progress. In the Gao'an area, our enemy armies engaged in fierce battles at Zhanggunao, Xiangfuguan Mountain, and other places. Under our fierce artillery fire, the enemy abandoned over a thousand bodies. After achieving our goal of attrition, we have moved to advantageous areas, and the enemy will never succeed. As for our army's counter-attack on Wuning, at noon on the 2nd, it launched a brave attack on the enemy on Hushan Changlun Shang with the force of a bamboo splitting, but the enemy resisted stubbornly, resulting in a long and fierce battle. The enemy's line collapsed and retreated towards Wuning, and our army took advantage of the victory to attack, killing countless enemies. On the morning of the 3rd, the main part of the enemy army came to aid, and after we defeated them one by one, we continued to track and advance all day on the 4th, forcing an attack on the southern outskirts of Wuning. The enemy inside the city was in a state of panic (to be continued).</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The quality of conscription is crucial to the war of resistance. Although the authorities strictly supervise the personnel handling conscription in various places, they also have a clear system of rewards and punishments to encourage and warn them. The following is a list of the personnel who were awarded and punished for handling conscription, as announced by the Military Service Administration on March 26: Huang Weichi, commander of the Nanyang Corps Management District in Henan, was awarded a major merit for outstanding performance; Chen Wenfan, magistrate of Nanchuan County in Sichuan, was publicly commended for outstanding performance and promoted to a first-class county vacancy; Zhong Xiangyu, concurrently magistrate of Luochuan County in Shaanxi, was commended for his effective conscription work; Liu Fengwu, magistrate of Yichuan County in Shaanxi, was commended for his effective conscription work; Lu Renshan, magistrate of Zhongbu County in Shaanxi, was commended for his effective conscription work; Wang Ditao, magistrate of Fufeng County in Gansu, was commended for excellent performance; Pu Jiyang, magistrate of Beisha County in Gansu, was given two merits for excellent performance; Li Huan, magistrate of Huating County in Gansu, was given one merit for excellent performance; Huang Chao, commander of the Huaiyang Corps Management District in Henan, was given one demerit for the worst performance; Ying Peng, commander of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing Division Management District in Zhejiang, was publicly criticized for submitting reports without following formal procedures and for improper personnel handling; Wang Xingzhai, a staff member of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing Division Management District in Zhejiang, was publicly criticized for neglecting to review documents; Tang Jingxiu, director of the Ningbo Recruitment Affairs in Zhejiang, was publicly criticized for attacking his superiors; Li Wuhe, magistrate of Fuling County in Sichuan, was dismissed from his post for neglecting conscription; He Jingqing, magistrate of Shang County in Shaanxi, was given a major demerit for handling conscription in name only; Li Shude, magistrate of Mianchi County in Henan, was given a major demerit for arbitrarily dismissing draftees in violation of explicit orders.

<h3 id="e12">Editorial: The Wang Jingwei Secret Treaty Theory <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei's flight from his post to seek peace occurred at the end of last year, nearly ten months ago, and this newspaper has repeatedly discussed it. We believe that abandoning one's post and leaving the country is one mistake, in action. Advocating a policy that clearly contradicts the national policy and rashly proclaiming it both domestically and abroad is a second mistake, in failing to recognize the importance of the overall situation. Ignoring Japan's long-term plans to destroy China and falling into their trap, naively believing in equal and mutually beneficial peace, is a third mistake, in lacking sufficient understanding. Thinking too lightly of oneself, believing that everyone can speak their own mind; thinking too highly of oneself, believing that one can rally all parties; taking preconceived notions and biased views as true and insightful knowledge, and treating national and global affairs as one's own family affairs to be manipulated at will; a fourth mistake, in forgetting one's roots. In summary, the main points are as follows. Some denounce him as a traitor collaborating with the enemy, willingly serving as a puppet, deeply hating and abhorring him, and severely condemning him. We, however, believe that Wang Jingwei was blinded by greed, leading to his absurdity. Regardless of how his intentions and actions may seem, the possible objective result will be no different from betraying the country and collaborating with the enemy, and condemnation is certainly appropriate. However, judging his true intentions, it is probably not the case. Calmly and rationally, weighing the situation and discussing the matter, we should not exaggerate too much. Who knew that his errors would not stop there.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a dispatch from Chongqing stated that Wang Jingwei had actually signed a secret treaty with Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, listing specific details that were beyond imagination, with the loss of his conscience beyond the pale, defying all ordinary emotions and reasons. It went far beyond human nature, which is why it was beyond our expectations. He not only acquiesced to the current situation and surrendered, but also offered further advice on military matters: Taking advantage of the fact that the reorganization of the Chinese central government's army had not yet been completed, he urged Japan to launch a fierce offensive, targeting Xi'an, Nanning, Changsha, Xiangyang, and Fancheng. His intention was that only in this way could he protect his envisioned small court, and only in this way could he place the National Government in a desperate situation. In his self-serving plans, he aimed to raise twenty divisions of henchmen, to fulfill his dream of being a capable scholar, accomplished in both literary and martial arts; to claim the title of "Director-General," to fulfill his long-cherished dream of becoming a leader; to demand three million yuan per month, taking two hundred million yuan outright, to fulfill his dream of wealth and security; to abolish the puppet organizations in Beiping and Nanjing, to carry out his dream of monopolizing the betrayal of the country; to curry favor with Germany and Italy, and yet not dare to offend Britain and the United States, there must be another dream of relying on foreign aid to permanently secure his position. Alas, what Wang Jingwei once repeatedly proclaimed to the world, taking mutual destruction and mutual prosperity as the basis of his argument; taking the future of China and the future of East Asia as the subject of his theory, his arguments were shallow, but perhaps could deceive the naive, and his subject was ambiguous, but perhaps could be considered grand. Now, if we examine the contents of the secret treaty, we can see that the prosperity he spoke of was the prosperity of Wang Jingwei and Japan, and the future he spoke of was the future of Wang Jingwei and Japan. Is there anything else? Is there anything else?</p>
<p>The so-called "China experts" in Japan possess an unsurpassed dedication and industriousness, yet they are like carving a mark on a moving boat to find a lost sword, unaware that times have changed. Therefore, they completely fail to understand the Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. This time, they rashly launched a military invasion, resulting in being burned and exhausted, running out of strength and unable to continue. This is a fundamental error that is regrettable but inexcusable. As for colluding with the foolish Wang Jingwei and signing a useless secret treaty, if this is not a continuation of their traditional error as "China experts," then it is a clear recognition that it is akin to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger, using it only to soothe their longing when they are extremely hungry and thirsty. And while millions or even two hundred million yuan is a huge sum, under China's long-term war of resistance, Japan is facing indefinite victory and endless consumption, with military expenses calculated in the millions. Compared to these two, the amount bribed in the secret treaty to feed Wang Jingwei is not even worth considering as an extremely large sum. Moreover, given China's vastness and wealth, investing millions or even two hundred million yuan, even though the effectiveness is uncertain, compared to the two, it is still a "low-risk, high-return" gamble. Is this not what Hiranuma thought?</p>
<p>But is the secret treaty truly authentic? This newspaper based its information on Reuters, which based its information on Chongqing newspapers. As of the time of writing, there has been no denial from the relevant authorities, so there is little room for doubt. Today, China is facing a great crisis unprecedented in the world, and those who govern the country must base their responses on the political principles that China has historically used to deal with chaotic times. The way to deal with someone like Wang Jingwei should be based on the future of the nation and people, and without hesitation or favoritism, the strictest sanctions should be imposed. He roams freely abroad, truly beyond the reach of national law, but for three months, rumors have been circulating frequently, and the authorities have still been lenient towards Wang Jingwei. Whether it's the way to govern in times of chaos, at most it is debatable, and will not be discussed here. Even from the perspective of deterring others through punishment, he is already on the list of those who cannot be treated with leniency. If we talk about preventing problems before they arise, then the problem has arisen gradually, and seeing the small, we know the big. Considering Wang Jingwei's character, his position, and his history, and yet he has gone so far as to flee and advocate for peace, then his character inherently has the potential to do anything. This can be foreseen. If we continue to be lenient, then he will act wantonly and even sign a treaty to betray the country.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Over the Past Year, Heavy Japanese Casualties in the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region, Nineteen Officers of the Rank of Major or Above Killed in Action, Casualty Rate Increasing Daily, Difficult to Sustain <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Xingji: A responsible agency in the 口(mouth - presumably referring to a person/organization) war zone recently released statistics on various aspects since the beginning of the war. There have been eight positional battles in northern Chahar and northern Shanxi around Datong, Tianzhen, Pingxingguan, Tiejiaoling, Xinkou (including the plains), Niangziguan, Taiyuan, and Hanhouling, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 23.5 to 1. There have been thirty-nine sieges, with twenty-four successful and fifteen unsuccessful, and five counter-attacks (in the triangle area of Hanhouling and Shanxi). There have been thirty-two sieges, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 1.4 to 1. The larger battles fought against Japanese troops on the move from March 1938 to February of this year numbered twelve, and the smaller battles numbered over 2,900, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 3 to 5. There have been 971 mobile battles involving units of regimental size or larger from March 1938 to March 18 of this year, and 2,302 involving smaller units. There have been 132 larger night attacks, with ninety-four successful and thirty-eight unsuccessful, with a Chinese-Japanese casualty ratio of 1 to 4. Nineteen Japanese officers of the rank of major or above have been killed in action, including Major General Miura Toshiji, commander of the 21st Brigade of the 5th Division; Major General Shimo Yoshihisa, commander of the 40th Brigade of the 20th Division at "Xinkou"; Brigadier General Choei, name and title unknown; Colonel Sato, commander of the Engineer Regiment at "Zhongtiaoshan"; Colonel Shinjyo Jun, commander of the 3rd Transport Regiment of the 2nd Division at "Guoxian"; Colonel Ebina Hiroshi, commander of the 123rd Regiment of the 108th Division at "Xinri"; Colonel Ishida Kanetoshi, commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division at "Lingshi"; a colonel in the Field Artillery, regiment commander, name unknown; Lieutenant Colonel Takeshima Kyoichi, battalion commander of the 20th Division at Jiwang Mountain; Lieutenant Colonel Oka Takafuminosuke, battalion commander of the 105th Regiment of the 108th Division at "Pingding"; Lieutenant Colonel Naritomi Eiju, battalion commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division at "Gaoping"; Lieutenant Colonel Nomura Mamoru, battalion commander of the 10th Field Artillery Regiment; Lieutenant Colonel Konbayashi Kichiro, battalion commander of the 108th Field Artillery Regiment at "Xinkou"; Major Morimoto Hiroshi, battalion commander of the 18th Cavalry Regiment at "Niangziguan"; Major Fujii Kunitaro, battalion commander of the 119th Regiment of the 109th Division at "Lucheng"; Major Harada Ai, battalion commander of the 78th Regiment of the 20th Division; Major Yamada Tatsutsune, battalion commander of the 14th Division at "Nankou"; Major Nakao Sakuro, commander of the Independent Machine Gun Battalion of the 14th Division at "Lucheng"; and Major Takahashi Kenyemon, battalion commander of the 77th Regiment of the 20th Division at "Nankou." The above statistics include three major generals, five colonels, five lieutenant colonels, and six majors. The most noteworthy thing about the statistics is the dramatic change in the Chinese-Japanese casualty figures. Before March 1938, it took 23.5 Chinese casualties to kill one Japanese soldier in positional warfare. After March, with the change to mobile warfare, it took 1.4 Chinese casualties to kill one Japanese soldier in sieges, 3 Chinese casualties to kill 5 Japanese soldiers in mobile engagements, and the Japanese suffered 4 casualties for every Chinese casualty in night attacks. With China's continuous influx of new forces and the Japanese steadily weakening, the disparity in these ratios will continue to increase. It can be asserted that if they continue to support the long-term war in this way and greatly deplete their strength, the Japanese warlords are bound to fail. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) (3) Provincial banks or local banks of all provinces should, in accordance with the Special Regulations on Frugality and National Construction Savings, submit a special plan to the Ministry of Finance for approval to handle national construction savings; (4) Provincial banks or local banks in the rear areas, if in need of circulating funds, should, in accordance with the Outline of Measures for Improving Local Financial Institutions, receive one-yuan notes and fractional currency notes, and cannot issue any silver notes. Those who have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue fractional currency notes must not request additional issuance; (5) Provinces in the rear areas should strive for self-sufficiency. For agricultural, industrial, and mining products related to military and civilian livelihoods, provincial banks or local banks of all provinces should promote their balanced development by providing financial accommodation. For example, if a province produces more grain but lacks cotton, the granting of loans for cotton planting should be encouraged to increase cotton production and achieve self-sufficiency; (6) Provincial banks or local banks of all provinces should pay attention to preventing the spread of enemy counterfeit banknotes; (7) Provincial banks or local banks of all provinces should actively promote the agency business of provincial, municipal, and county treasuries; (8) Provincial banks or local banks of all provinces should quickly train middle and lower-level cadres and staff members to supplement branch banks and offices; (D) Regarding how to facilitate the purchase of materials: (1) Tradable agricultural and industrial products may be purchased on behalf of the Trade Commission by provincial banks or local banks, and goods for domestic sales may be purchased on behalf of the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau by provincial banks or local banks, or operated independently by provincial banks and local banks. However, the purchase of the same type of materials within the same region should be handled by one agency in principle; (2) For the convenience of liaison, the entrusting agency may send special commissioners to reside permanently in the head offices of provincial banks or local banks in each province, or in the branch offices of important distribution markets; (3) There are three types of purchase methods: First, the entrusting agency and the provincial bank or local bank agree on a contract, and the provincial bank or local bank is responsible for delivering the goods, with the provincial bank or local bank bearing all profits and losses; Second, the entrusting agency entrusts the provincial bank to handle the matter on its behalf, and the price fluctuations are negotiated by both parties at any time, and the entrusting agency gives a commission as appropriate; Third, the provincial bank or local bank collects the goods itself and sells them to the Trade Commission and the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, with the price negotiated at any time; (4) After accepting the entrustment, the provincial bank or local bank should engage in purchasing in the fastest possible way, and the required funds will be advanced by the bank. After the goods are handed over to the entrusting agency, the entrusting agency will pay the value of the goods in cash. If a provincial bank or local bank issues small denomination banknotes and needs to pay issuance reserves, it may negotiate with the entrusting agency to deposit the value of the goods with the central government as the bank's cash reserve for issuance, so as to avoid mutual transfers; (5) The delivery location for the goods entrusted for purchase should be the largest distribution market and the most convenient transportation area in the province, which should be negotiated by both parties at any time; (6) The responsibility for transportation, storage, and safekeeping of the goods entrusted for purchase shall be borne by the entrusted agency before delivery, and by the entrusting agency after delivery, but both parties should assist each other; (7) In order to facilitate the purchase of products, provincial banks or local banks should report the production status, price fluctuations, changes in transportation tools, storage facilities, etc. of various products to the entrusting agency at any time, so that both parties can handle them quickly. In war zones or near war zones, the military movements should be reported to the entrusting agency at any time in the fastest possible way. The entrusting agency should notify the entrusted agency of the situation in the international market and the price fluctuations of export products at any time; (8) Provincial banks or local banks should actively promote frugality, reduce domestic sales, and transport as much as possible abroad to earn foreign exchange for exportable goods; (9) Provincial banks or local banks should investigate the production costs and past market prices of products. If there is any intentional raising of prices or hoarding for speculation, measures should be taken to crack down on them; (10) If provincial banks or local banks lack transportation and storage tools, they may negotiate with the entrusting agency to jointly equip them, or apply to the local government and war zone commander for paid rental from the people, and the entrusting agency should submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to forward it to the Military Affairs Commission for the exemption of requisitioning transportation tools for the purchase of these products; (11) Regarding the insurance problem of storing purchased products, the Ministry of Finance should be requested to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau to plan and handle it; (12) Inter-provincial trade should be closely coordinated by provincial banks and local banks in each province, and the supply and demand of goods should be reported to each other to address shortages and surpluses. The methods should be negotiated according to the situation in each province; (13) In order to facilitate the transportation of local products, provincial banks or local banks should establish transportation stations at various key locations, and intermodal transport stations should be established between Province A and Province B to facilitate convenience; (14) Civilian laborers used for transportation tools should be exempted from military service by the military authorities; (E) Regarding how to balance price fluctuations: (1) In a positive aspect, 1. For products that are the main local goods and are necessary for people's daily life, provincial banks and local banks should purchase or store as much as possible and accommodate funds when the price of such products falls too much (if funds are insufficient, they may also request re-discounting or re-mortgaging from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank), or reduce their taxes, or facilitate their transportation, always maintaining their original price index as a measure, but if the price rises due to purchasing, the work of price stabilization and balancing should also be carried out; 2. Although the product is the main local product, it is not necessary for daily life. When the price of this product falls too much, provincial banks and local banks should provide low-interest loans as much as possible, and should investigate the sales stagnation or transportation difficulties. If necessary, they may contact neighboring provincial banks to negotiate sales or re-mortgage and re-transport various items. When the price rises too much, the reasons should be investigated. If it is a raw material needed by agriculture, industry, and handicrafts in other provinces, the local government should be requested to use political power to stabilize it; 3. Products that are daily necessities but not the main products of the area, the price of such products rises greatly during the production season, provincial banks and local banks should find ways to widely purchase and transport from places with abundant production, or use local existing institutions to accommodate their funds and facilitate their transportation, so that they can fully purchase and transport more from places with abundant production, but at the same time, they should sell them at fair prices in accordance with these regulations; (2) In a negative aspect, provincial banks and local banks should be responsible for compiling and investigating the price index of local products and daily necessities. If the price fluctuates too much, they should request the local government to find ways to stabilize it. At the same time, they should contact local chambers of commerce and trade association representatives to establish a price balancing association, with representatives from provincial and county-level administrative agencies, provincial banks, and local bank branch representatives participating and presiding over it. Those who hoard and speculate or refuse to sell for no reason should be reported by the balancing association to the local military police and administrative agencies for an order to sell at the price or search them; (F) Regarding how to help meet the needs of food: (1) Provincial banks or local banks in each province should report the production, consumption, transportation, and distribution of major food in their province to the central government and the competent authorities of neighboring provinces (such as the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, etc.) at any time for reference in planning and adjustment; (2) For a certain kind of food that the province cannot supply itself or is in surplus but is needed by other provinces, provincial banks or local banks should cooperate with the competent production agencies to lend funds, and pay special attention to the lending of seed, agricultural tools, plowing cattle and other production factors to help them improve and produce; (3) When the supply and demand of a certain kind of food cannot correspond and the price fluctuates too much, provincial banks or local banks should assist the food management agency in purchasing, transporting, and selling, or use their own transportation to regulate the people's food; (4) Provincial banks or local banks should build warehouses and handle storage business in food distribution markets and convenient transportation locations to regulate supply and demand; (5) For food transportation, we should make the most of low-cost tools such as wooden boats, hand trucks, and livestock, so as not to make the cost too high. When necessary, provincial banks or local banks may organize their own transport teams, and local military police agencies should give them effective protection; (6) Storing food should pay attention to whether its quality can be durable, and it should be inspected and turned over frequently to prevent mildew. Try to convert new and old food every year; (7) The location of food storage should be connected with the local military and political authorities. The production is particularly small and will be important military areas in the future, and places where the people are gathered, such as western Hunan, western Hubei, southern Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, western Guangxi, southern Shaanxi, and eastern Gansu, etc., should be specially maintained and stored in greater quantities to assist; (8) The Salt Affairs Agency has overall methods for increasing the production and sales of salt in various regions. Provincial banks or local banks should provide loans to salt production and transportation merchants. When necessary, they may contact the local Salt Affairs Agency to undertake transportation themselves and promote sales in the interior to help the people's food. Places where remittance is inconvenient should also find ways to facilitate communication or transport funds on their behalf to facilitate transportation and sales. Overall, the contents of the above cases are extremely detailed and thorough. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will supervise the financial industry to implement them effectively, which will surely contribute to the future of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.

<h3 id="e21">Chamberlain Explains to Parliament the Contents of the Anglo-Polish Agreement, Mutual Assistance Nature Similar to Franco-Polish Alliance, Agreement Applies When Independence is Threatened <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently made a statement in the House of Commons today, explaining the circumstances of the government's talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, stating, "Our country and Poland have reached a complete compromise on certain principles. Previously, our government gave Poland a temporary and unilateral guarantee (according to the Prime Minister's announcement on the 31st of last month). Now, after consultation between the two parties, a permanent mutual agreement will be concluded to replace it. Before the official establishment of this agreement, Foreign Minister Beck provided our country with a guarantee, stating that Poland decided to accept the constraint to assist Britain, the nature of which should be the same as that accepted by Britain for Poland. One thing must be stated is that this permanent agreement is not directed at any country. The goal is that if the independence and sovereignty of Britain and Poland are directly or indirectly threatened, both parties should implement mutual assistance," etc. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Min's conclusion states that before the formal signing of this agreement, there are still prerequisite issues that need to be studied, such as when the mutual assistance guarantee will take effect. He also stated that during this negotiation, neither party was prohibited from establishing an agreement on peace with a third country. In short, the Anglo-Polish agreement currently under negotiation is generally similar in nature to the Franco-Polish agreement. (6th Haitong)</p>
<p>(London) Responsible persons here recently stated that the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement should be signed and established within days. People in diplomatic circles say that the British authorities should go a step further and include all countries belonging to the "status quo maintenance faction." However, in the current situation, it is particularly difficult to establish a general agreement among Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union. The reason is that Poland is unwilling to associate with the Soviet Union, and because of its friendly relations with Hungary, it is unwilling to give Romania a solid guarantee. Certain aspects of the British side, in view of this, advocated that Britain should establish mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union and Romania separately on the basis of the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement, and then establish similar agreements with the other three countries of the Balkan Entente, namely Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, all diplomatic and political correspondents of the London newspapers unanimously declared that Britain and Poland have now signed a "Joint Defense Alliance." British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to announce the contents of the agreement in the House of Commons this afternoon. The newspapers believe that Britain and Romania may also conclude the same agreement. It is also heard that Poland is preparing to add supplementary clauses to the Baltic Military Alliance to adapt to the current situation. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union will also join the "Joint Defense Alliance" after obtaining guarantees for its borders from the relevant countries. (6th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to Polish sources here, the diplomatic authorities of Britain and Poland have agreed that the mutual assistance agreement to be concluded should apply to all acts of aggression without any caveats. It is heard that the British side has promised to provide financial assistance to Poland to expand its military equipment so as to be able to cope with all incidents. As for Polish Jews, they may also be accommodated by the British colonies as appropriate. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to Polish sources, the Anglo-Polish talks have had the effect of making the Anglo-Polish alliance a reality. It is heard that the general principles of political and economic cooperation between the two countries have been agreed upon. It is heard that Colonel Beck advocated during the talks that Poland's position on Hungary should be included in the Eastern European Defense Alliance, and stated that Poland did not want the Soviet Union to join this alliance. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's talks will continue tonight and have reached a stage where a statement can be issued. It is expected that Chamberlain will report this matter in the House of Commons tomorrow. Perhaps a short meeting will be held tomorrow night to consider certain details. The results of the talks are expected to satisfy both parties. No detailed information was released by the British authorities tonight. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) Italian sources here stated yesterday, before the signing of the Anglo-Polish alliance treaty, that if Germany were to invade Poland, and if the scope of the war were limited to Germany and Poland, Italy might maintain neutrality. However, French political figures stated that this claim is not necessarily reliable. Given that France has already signed an alliance treaty with Poland, and Britain has accepted similar obligations towards Poland, Italy, even if it desires to maintain neutrality, may find it impossible. In the event of war, Italy's responsibilities will likely be limited to the Mediterranean region. This can be observed from the recent measures taken by the Italian authorities on Rhodes and the Spanish-owned Balearic Islands. Furthermore, these Italian sources also stated that because the Italian government has lost influence in the Danube region and fears Germany's expansion of influence along the Mediterranean coast, it is willing to overcome all difficulties to extend its influence into the Balkans through Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Greece. However, German influence has already extended to the Mediterranean coast. The German troops and military supplies in Spain are being replenished. The position of German advisors in the Spanish Nationalist government is at least equal to that of Italian advisors. Moreover, Germany's expansion of influence into Italian Libya in North Africa is increasing daily. In the past two months, German instructors have been assisting in equipping Italian military equipment being shipped to Libya, and German aviation is also very active there. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Stimson Speaks Out Righteously: Condemns the Actions of Aggressor Nations; the U.S. Should Unite with Other Nations to Curb Aggression; the Current Neutrality Law Needs Revision <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) During a public meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to discuss revisions to the Neutrality Act, former Secretary of State Stimson delivered a moving speech denouncing the aggressor nations and expressing support for China and other nations that have been subjected to aggression. He stated that the current international situation is abnormal and that this situation may last for years or even decades. Three of the world's seven great powers have abandoned the principle of "mutual respect between nations." These countries have also invented a very clever tactic that has been successful for several years. They frequently take unilateral actions to destroy previous commitments, treaties, and laws that hinder their outward expansion. Threats, aggression, and violations of existing treaties have become indispensable elements of these countries' policies. Since 1931, the invasions of Manchuria, North China, South China, Abyssinia, Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania have all contradicted existing treaties and international law. The events we must address are revolutionary in nature. These three great powers are militarily in advantageous positions and have a superior offensive capability against their peace-loving neighbors. These countries often act in concert and threaten the transportation, finances, and national defense organizations of other countries. Therefore, it is imperative that all nations of the world take collective action in defense. Regarding the current Neutrality Act of our country, a major flaw has been discovered. That is, certain countries, especially those that may be enemies of our country in the future, are using this law to deprive the United States of its freedom of choice in foreign trade. We are still forced to treat the peace-loving and suffering Chinese people and their militaristic enemies in the same way, which is just one example. We know that if militarists can conquer China, they will further use China as a base to carry out aggression against other parts of the world, but because of the current Neutrality Act, we cannot distinguish between them. Regarding the recent events in Spain, the Republican government was the only legitimate government recognized by the United States. We deprived them of their right to purchase foreign military supplies because we implemented the Neutrality Act. On the other hand, the rebels in Spain were fully supported by Mussolini of Italy and Hitler of Germany. As a result, the legitimate government recognized by the United States was overthrown. This is not fair." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Former Secretary of State Stimson appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to express his views on the revision of the Neutrality Act. He said that peace-loving countries should take collective action. If war breaks out in Europe this spring, and if our country's current Neutrality Act is not revised, the United States will likely be the next to be attacked after the invaded countries. The United States accounts for one-third of the world's production of various raw materials. Is it wise to use a large portion of these resources to "encourage countries that may be our enemies to step up their activities and step up their aggression over the past two years? Economic weapons can cause crises if they are not used properly, but when it is necessary to use these weapons, we are in a better position than any other country in the world." Today, certain governments are pursuing policies of aggression, and all international laws based on mutual respect between nations have been despised by them. Therefore, isolationism and neutrality laws based on past international law are no longer applicable. "The great crisis currently facing world culture is unparalleled since the end of the fourth century." Our Congress should give the President greater power to adapt to changing circumstances. The fear that the President will abuse his power in diplomacy is unfounded. Stimson then raised the question: "Is the security we enjoy now temporary? Are we going to be passive and seek temporary peace, or are we going to use our economic advantages in a moderate, resolute, and wise manner to prevent crises in the world (of which our country is a part)?" He speculated that if our country can do something for the world, the actions of the Axis (referring to the German-Italian Axis) can be reduced, and the threatened countries will be encouraged to reject all humiliating demands. Otherwise, countries will yield to power, and the United States will also face a crisis." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies gathered at the Palace of Versailles in the suburbs at 2:00 PM today to hold a National Assembly to elect the President. A total of 904 members participated in the vote. Incumbent President Lebrun was immediately re-elected with a majority of 506 votes. Socialist candidate Bedouce received 151 votes, Communist candidate Cachin received 74 votes, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Herriot (Radical Socialist, not a candidate) received 53 votes, Centralist candidate Godart received 50 votes, former Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Pucheu (who had withdrawn from the election) received 16 votes, and Centralist member of the Chamber of Deputies Pietri (who had also withdrawn from the election) received 10 votes. The Chairman of the National Assembly, Senate Speaker Jeanneney, then returned to Beijing from Versailles with Prime Minister Daladier to congratulate President Lebrun. According to the constitution, after the election of the new President, the Prime Minister may be reappointed. Prime Minister Daladier has also decided to make a "symbolic" resignation to the President. Since the person elected is the current President, this is not necessary. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The re-election of incumbent President Lebrun has been commented on by various newspapers. The right-wing newspapers generally expressed their delight, saying that the stability of the French political situation and the common sense of the French people are clear evidence of this. The Socialist People's Daily published an article by party leader Blum, stating that although President Lebrun was not elected unanimously by the National Assembly, "he has been re-elected and has become the head of state whom we should respect. As for all the gains and losses of the French Republic, they should be settled with the Prime Minister, the head of the government who is legally and factually responsible." The Communist L'Humanité said that "this election failed to symbolize the unity of France in the face of foreign threats, which the people must regret." (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>(London) Conservative MP Morgan stated in the House of Commons today that since the Japanese government restricts export trade in North China and does not allow exports unless banknotes are purchased from Japanese-run banks, Britain should require that exports from North China not be allowed to enter British or British colonial ports unless they hold consular certificates proving that they have been remitted through British, American, or French banks. Undersecretary of State Butler replied in writing that Morgan's proposal, along with the general issue of protecting British interests in China, is under consideration by the government.

<p>(Rome) Regarding rumors that Italy intends to take military action against Albania, the Albanian ambassador returned home yesterday to report. He has now returned to his post. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Tirana - Today, the Albanian National Army vowed to fight for national independence and said that if the government agrees to become a protectorate of Italy, they will revolt. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Continental Edition of the London Daily Mail recently reported that "yesterday evening, rumors circulated in Albania that Italy would soon send troops into the country. After the news spread, the whole country was shaken, and the cabinet held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. A public statement was subsequently issued saying that 'appropriate precautionary measures' have been taken militarily. King Zog I also declared that the Albanian people will resolutely rise up to defend the country until the last soldier if necessary. In addition, a large number of Italian expatriates have returned to Italy, and other expatriates will follow suit. The Continental Edition of the New York Herald Tribune published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, claiming that 'Italian naval and land forces have concentrated in the southern ports of Brindisi or in the city of Bari. At the same time, residents of the Albanian capital held anti-Italian demonstrations yesterday, and the situation is very serious. According to a radio broadcast from Bari on March 3rd, Italy and Albania are negotiating to strengthen the defense alliance treaty signed between the two countries on November 22, 1927. The Albanian people are deeply dissatisfied after hearing the news and have launched demonstrations to protest." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Tirana - The people of Tirana are quite panicked today, as if awaiting the outbreak of an incident. Although there is a two-day holiday due to the birth of the Crown Prince, it is still very tense everywhere. After Albanians demanded independence over the weekend, small squads of Albanian soldiers continued to patrol the streets. Yesterday, Italian merchants sent their families back to Italy. Foreign consulates, including the U.S. consulate, have not yet planned to evacuate the people of their respective countries. Except for Italian trainers of the Albanian army, there are no Italian planes or Italian troops in Albanian territory. Italians began to evacuate last night, including Italian trainers. Italian charter tricycles transported Italians last night, and the remaining Italians will return to Italy this morning. It is reported that a large number of Albanians are heading to Vlora, which is within the Italian sphere of influence and has oil fields. The area is also the closest point on land to Italy. It is also reported that arms are being transported into the area. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Tirana - According to today's news, because the Albanian King insisted on firmly refusing Italy's request to open airfields and occupy seaports in Albania, Italian expatriates have been ordered to withdraw. The only Italians now remaining in Albania are diplomats who are still negotiating with the Albanian government. The Albanian cabinet held a special emergency meeting last night to discuss the Italian-Albanian negotiations underway in the Yugoslav capital and whether to request Britain to guarantee Albania's territorial integrity. As for the ongoing negotiations with Italy, they are purely economic and financial in nature and do not involve seeking Italian assistance. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "According to the 1927 agreement, there is no provision for seeking Italian military assistance, and in fact, no one is threatening us."

<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this morning, opposition Labour MP Henderson asked whether the government was aware that Italian troops and transport ships were reportedly concentrated in the ports of Bari and Durazzo in Albania, and that Italy and Albania were in negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on the 4th of this month to draw attention to reports that Italy had sent warships to Albania. Foreign Minister Ciano replied that the Albanian government had proposed on the 8th of last month to strengthen the current alliance treaty between Italy and Albania, and that the various external reports were not true. As far as I know, the negotiations between the Italian and Albanian governments have encountered some difficulties, but the nature of the talks is unknown to the outside world. Foreign Minister Ciano also stated that Italian interests in Albania have been threatened. It has been learned that an Italian cruiser and two smaller warships arrived in the Albanian port of Durazzo this morning. What the Albanian government thinks is something I have not yet received detailed reports on. According to newspaper reports, the Albanian government finds it difficult to accept any measures that conflict with its independent sovereignty and territorial integrity. The British Ambassador to Albania reported this morning that everything was calm as of 8:25 AM and that no incidents had occurred. But the British government will continue to monitor the situation in Albania closely. Henderson then asked whether the situation in the Mediterranean had changed, which would conflict with the Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 16th last year, and whether Ambassador Perth had urged the Italian government to pay attention to this point. The Prime Minister did not answer this question directly, but only declared in response to another MP that although Britain does not have direct interests in Albania, it is very concerned about general peace.

<p>(London) The Berlin newspapers and some Roman newspapers have criticized British Naval Minister Stanhope's speech in Portsmouth on Tuesday with their usual acrimony, accusing the British of warmongering and saying that Britain is now dominated by a psychology of chaos. (Sixth day, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) British Naval Minister Earl Stanhope spoke to about a thousand guests on the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" last night, saying, "The Duke of Kent was unable to attend due to a sore throat, and there are others who are also unable to come tonight, because when I was about to leave the Admiralty, it was necessary to issue orders to prepare the fleet's anti-aircraft guns. Before the guests boarded this ship, sixteen anti-aircraft guns were ready to give those who came a warm welcome." So far, the Naval Minister's remarks. Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned this matter in the House of Commons, saying that Earl Stanhope's words were casual and not premeditated, and Earl Stanhope did not ask the newspapers to pay special attention to these words. Earl Stanhope merely said that some naval personnel remained on the ship to prepare the anti-aircraft guns, so they could not all attend last night's meeting. In a tense situation, preparing anti-aircraft guns is a common practice. The Admiralty issued an instruction that vigilance should not be relaxed even during special gatherings, and no other orders were issued. He was afraid that the Naval Minister's words might cause alarm, so he asked the newspapers not to disclose his words. Unfortunately, his efforts to prevent unwarranted public unrest were not entirely successful. However, this matter, no matter what, is enough to show that the British Navy is always on guard against unforeseen circumstances. (The audience laughed and cheered) Earl Stanhope later went to the Prime Minister's residence to explain everything. After the Naval Minister's remarks were first broadcast by radio, some criticisms were raised, viewing it as an alarming event. In fact, there was no reason to be alarmed. Therefore, he asked the newspapers not to disclose it, or to regard it as a special and important event. Earl Stanhope also explained the situation in the House of Lords, which was roughly the same as what Chamberlain said in the House of Commons, and said, "My remarks were originally to explain that the British Navy, even during the Easter holidays, is prepared for unexpected events. I did not expect that this would increase the Prime Minister's workload or cause others to be alarmed. This is what I am sorry for." (Fifth day, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Since the Japanese troops in Hainan occupied various coastal areas, the Qiongya (Hainan) militia retreated to the mountains, guarding strategic passes to prevent the enemy from penetrating deeper. Therefore, the Japanese troops along the coast of the island have not succeeded in their attempts for the past month. Taking Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Chengmai, and a corner of Ya County as examples, the total number of Japanese troops deployed is estimated to be 40,000 to 50,000. Part of them were transferred from Guangzhou and, after failing to achieve any success, were transferred back to Guangzhou to re-establish defenses in the northwest and two rivers. At the end of this month, the Japanese troops in Guangzhou increased to more than 10,000, most of whom were assigned to Huaxian and Conghua in the North River, and Zengcheng Shitan and other places in the East River. Later, it was discovered that the Chinese troops in the West River, comprising the elite forces of Guangdong and Guangxi, numbered no less than 50,000. Fearing that they would move east, the guerrillas in Shunde in the lower reaches of the West River would attack their rear. Therefore, a portion of the naval and air forces, together with the marines, were mobilized to put pressure on the Shunde guerrillas. Since the fall of Daliang (the county seat of Shunde), the Chinese guerrillas under Li, Pan, Zhu, and Huang, numbering about 4,000 to 5,000, have withdrawn to Rongqi and Guizhou and concentrated there.</p>
<p>Rongqi and Guizhou Fall One After Another</p>
<p>The Japanese troops attempted to dislodge these local forces and transferred more than 1,000 troops from Foshan to advance on Shatou at 5:00 AM on the 27th, and used motorboats to carry marines from Xiaohuangpu in Zhongshan County to attack Beilang in Shunde, cutting off the rear of Rongqi market. At the same time, the right wing and central route of the Japanese troops surrounded the entire city of Rongqi. The local militia, outnumbered and outgunned, withdrew to Xiaohuangpu villages in the ninth district of Zhongshan County, and Guizhou was also lost. After entering Rongqi and Guizhou, the Japanese troops engaged in large-scale looting. The local grain reserves and livestock were first plundered, and then they set fire to the markets and looted cash from wealthy households. Refugees fled to Zhongshan and Xinhui for temporary shelter. After entering the city, the Japanese troops set up camp on Dafeng Mountain in Rongqi. A large fire raged throughout Rongqi market all day long. The Japanese troops used aircraft to bomb the Chinese army's positions and fortifications. Incendiary bombs set fire to civilian houses, and the bustling market was turned into scorched earth.</p>
<p>Zhutou Mountain Falls, Jiangmen in Peril</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops captured Ronggui in Shunde, their ambition was unabated. They continued to transfer more than 1,000 troops from Daliang and Longjiang to Rongqi and Guizhou to guard the land and water transportation hubs, and dispatched a motorboat to Ganzhutang in Shunde, and three shallow-draft warships ventured into the Rongqi River, attempting to advance into Jiangmen in Xinhui. The county's guerrillas were ordered to stand guard. At that time, the waterway was controlled by Japanese warships, and ferries from Jiangmen to Rongqi were suspended. Rumors abounded, and the people of Jiangmen were in turmoil. Some prepared to flee to the Siyi region, while others risked going to Shiqi to escape to Hong Kong and Macau. On the evening of the 27th, dozens of Japanese shallow-draft warships and motorboats advanced to the Yinggezui River. On the morning of the 28th, under the cover of Japanese aircraft bombing, the Japanese marines attempted to land on the west bank of Yinggezui, but were blocked by the Chinese army militia until the afternoon. Around 3:00 PM, the Japanese shallow-draft warships sailed into the Zhutou Mountain River, which borders Xinhui and Shunde counties, and docked, opening fire on the troops defending the mountain. Around 4:00 PM, they covered the motorboats and landed the Japanese troops. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, the fortifications of the troops defending the mountain were destroyed, and they moved to new positions. The Japanese troops occupied Zhutou Mountain that night. With the loss of this place, the county seat of Xinhui and the port of Jiangmen were threatened by the Japanese troops. The Xinhui armed militia still tightly guarded Henggang near the fifth district. After occupying Zhutou Mountain, the Japanese troops temporarily set up camp under the cover of naval gunfire. On that day, more than a dozen Japanese aircraft flew to Xinhui County and Jiangmen in batches to bomb them, once in the morning, once at noon, and twice in the afternoon. Eighteen bombs fell on North Street in Jiangmen, destroying a British church. Seven or eight bombs also hit villages near North Street, killing and injuring more than 40 civilians.</p>
<p>Refugees from Xinhui Flee to Hong Kong and Macau</p>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, Jiangmen became the only channel from Hong Kong and Macau to the interior. After the Japanese bombing on the 28th, the residents fled, and water and land transportation was completely cut off. The Japanese troops had long coveted the area but were unable to allocate sufficient troops to go there. Recently, reinforcements arrived, and after encompassing Shunde, they planned to further invade Xinhui and Jiangmen, cutting off transportation to the non-military areas. On the evening of the 29th, they divided their troops into three routes to attack Jiangmen and Xinhui City. One route took more than 20 motorboats and set off from Huangjiao towards North Street, one route bypassed Zhoujun from Zhutou Mountain and invaded Waihai and Jiangmen, and one route spied on Shuinan Village from Henggang, rushing towards various places on the morning of the 30th. The Xinhui militia repelled the enemy at Tangxia, capturing more than 100 Japanese troops. The remnants of the Japanese troops retreated to Zhutou Mountain that morning. Therefore, the Japanese troops attacking North Street did not dare to land, and Jiangmen was saved. However, North Street, Jiangmen, and Xinhui were devastated by low-flying bombing by Japanese aircraft, and the number of innocent civilians killed and injured reached thousands. The Japanese troops on the route attacking Shuinan once rushed to the intersection of Xinzhao Highway and Jiangfo Highway outside Zhongshan Park, but were repelled by the Chinese army. In Jiangmen City, Japanese plainclothes troops were once discovered raising the Japanese flag in an attempt to disrupt the morale of the Chinese army, but they were soon annihilated by the Chinese army. After this chaos in Jiangmen, all agencies and bank offices were relocated to Xinhui City. As of the 30th, many refugees were still fleeing to Hong Kong and Macau. According to those who fled to Hong Kong, a mixed battle broke out in the suburbs of Jiangmen on the evening of the 29th. After the Chinese army arrived, they defeated the Japanese troops. Countless civilians were killed and injured in North Street by Japanese aircraft bombing. The majority of the Japanese troops have retreated to Zhutou Mountain. The Chinese army's fresh troops are now guarding strategic passes in Zhoujun and Waihai. In addition, Chinese aircraft are attacking Japanese boats on the river. With this containment, the Japanese troops will not be able to be so rampant. As for the mail sent from Hong Kong to Jiangmen, it has not been able to be delivered since the 29th.

<h3 id="e52">The Currency Situation in Fujian Province The Circulation Volume of National and Provincial Banknotes <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yong'an Dispatch: Fujian Province has long had contact with overseas countries, but its commerce has not yet been modernized. Most of the currency is hoarded, and the speed of cash flow is far less than that of Western countries, and even less than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, it is difficult to make an accurate investigation of the amount of currency in circulation. However, since the central government issued a general order to implement the new currency system in November of the 24th year of the Republic, the amount of banknotes in circulation has greatly increased due to the efforts of the provincial authorities. After January of the 25th year of the Republic, the amount of banknotes issued by various banks in Fujian Province also saw a sharp increase. Taking only the Central Bank as an example, the monthly amount often reached around 12 million yuan, breaking the record for banknote issuance in Fujian Province.</p>
<p>In August of the 26th year of the Republic, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and the whole country fell into a state of war. The demand for currency in the Fujian market was unusually urgent. The monthly issuance of the Central Bank once exceeded 13 million yuan. Although it soon stabilized, it was enough to indicate the wartime commercial situation in Fujian Province and the consolidation of legal tender credit among the people. In addition to the Central Bank, there are also the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, which are designated by the government as national banks. Their issuance has been increasing since July of the 24th year of the Republic. As of August of last year, the Bank of China had increased from 741,000 yuan to 5,308,300 yuan, the Bank of Communications had increased from 309,000 yuan to 2,487,000 yuan, and the Agricultural Bank of China had increased from 213,000 yuan to 2,743,000 yuan. Among these four national banks, the Central Bank issued the largest amount of banknotes, followed by the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. After the implementation of the new currency system, the China Industrial Bank, because it was not designated by the government as a national bank, gradually withdrew the banknotes circulating in the market. By March of the 26th year of the Republic, there were only 33,000 yuan in the entire province. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the market lacked currency. As a temporary expedient, it was still allowed to issue banknotes, and the bank's issuance increased to 63,000 yuan, but compared with before, it was less than one-third. The face value of the banknotes of these five banks, except for the subsidiary currency notes issued by the Central Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, the lowest denomination is one yuan, which is convenient for the settlement of large-scale trade, but small-scale transactions feel deeply inconvenient. This shortcoming needs to be remedied by local banks.</p>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Bank was established in October of the 24th year of the Republic. In the past three years, because of sufficient funds and good credit among the people, people are more willing to use its subsidiary currency. The subsidiary currency currently circulating in the market includes five denominations: five jiao, two jiao, one jiao, five fen, and one fen. By the end of the 27th year of the Republic, the amount issued was more than 12 million yuan, of which the five-jiao note was the most, reaching 10,364,741 yuan. The one-jiao note was slightly less circulated, with a total value of 1,267,490 yuan. The two-jiao note was less, only 393,292.600 yuan. Last year, due to the lack of copper coins in the market, a five-fen note was added from November. Since the beginning of the issuance, it reached 52,500 yuan by the end of the year. This year, a one-fen note was added, and the printing cost was far higher than the face value. It can be seen that the bank is purely for facilitating the flexible turnover of the people, not for profit. The bank's responsibility is to develop the financial industry in the interior and assist national banks. Therefore, in the interior of Fujian Province, the banknotes of the provincial bank circulate very widely. People in large cities are more willing to use the bank's banknotes for purchasing foreign exchange, and the bank also fully supplies foreign exchange transactions. At the end of the 27th year of the Republic, out of the total issuance of 12 million yuan, the amount returned to the treasury for purchase of foreign exchange included 3,169,734.600 yuan in Fuzhou, 280,000 yuan in Jian'ou, 2,288,000 yuan in Hanjiang, 70,000 yuan in Sandu, 689,400 yuan in Saiqi, 73,000 yuan in Xiapu, and 116,000 yuan in Zhangzhou. Therefore, the actual amount of banknotes circulating in the market has not reached 8 million yuan. When the reporter traveled to southern Jiangxi in February of this year, he learned that the subsidiary currency of the Fujian Provincial Bank circulates in 67 counties in that area. In Ruijin alone, it accounts for three-quarters of the total currency in circulation in the market. Therefore, among these 8 million yuan, a part has actually flowed into other provinces. Some may doubt that the bank's capital is 5 million yuan, and the paid-up capital is only 2.5 million yuan. Even if all the capital is used as issuance reserves, it is less than 60%. This is a misunderstanding of the bank's business operations. The amount of capital is only to indicate the extent of the shareholders' responsibility. As for the bank's banknote issuance reserves, it does not rely entirely on capital. There are many sources of bank funds, such as deposits, etc., which can be used as issuance reserves. Therefore, although the bank's capital is only 2.5 million yuan, its available funds are far more than this amount. It is found that the bank's issuance reserves are based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, with 60% in cash and 40% in guarantees. Before June of the 25th year of the Republic, the bank maintained the 60/40 ratio. After July, the cash reserves became more adequate, averaging more than 70%. For example, at the end of the 27th year of the Republic, the amount issued was 12,078,003.60 yuan, and the cash reserves were 9,251,251.50 yuan, accounting for 76.38%. The guarantee reserves totaled 2,826,752.10 yuan, accounting for 23.4%, and the contents were various unified government bonds, provincial construction bonds, short-term treasury bills, etc., and all have been converted according to market prices. In fact, the number of people who cash in subsidiary currency notes does not exceed 70%. Therefore, in the current situation, it is more than sufficient to cope with it. If the cash redemption exceeds the cash reserve ratio, all kinds of guarantee reserves have market prices and are sufficient to cope with it. With these sufficient reserves, its subsidiary currency notes have won good credit in the market and are circulating smoothly. Since the provincial bank is a bank related to the provincial government, it is often suspected that it is maintaining its finances and that it may inevitably print and issue banknotes as much as possible, and promote it with political power, which will inevitably lead to inflation. In fact, the promotion and maintenance of provincial bank notes do not rely on the power of the provincial government. The reason why it can circulate in the society is because it has sufficient reserves and can maintain its good credit. As for the amount of loans made by government agencies to the bank, the amount is very small, and the government has always maintained good credit. According to the bank's business report for the 26th year of the Republic, loans to government agencies were no more than 1 million yuan, accounting for only about 20% of the total loans. The province's finances, after the efforts of the authorities to plan, have shown significant effects in terms of increasing revenue. In terms of reducing expenditure, there has been a major tightening in recent years. Therefore, there is no problem with revenue and expenditure. Except for short-term transfers, there is no borrowing from the provincial bank. The provincial bank's loans are mostly used for agricultural, industrial, and commercial construction projects, etc., which are not only harmless but also beneficial to society.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Yesterday, Various Circles Publicly Celebrated Ma Xiangbo's 100th Birthday; Chairman Wu Yunqi Delivered a Congratulatory Speech; the Assembly Telegraphed Congratulations to Hanoi; the Broadcast Birthday Celebration Will Conclude Tonight <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday. Various circles in this city held a public celebration at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. Over a thousand people participated, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The assembly also sent a telegram to congratulate Mr. Ma. The broadcast birthday celebration, held at the Aviation Radio Station, is scheduled to conclude tonight. Details of each event are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Celebration Grandeur</p>
<p>The public celebration was held yesterday at 4:00 PM. The birthday hall was set up in the two-story hall of the Ningbo Tongxiang Association, with solemn and simple decorations. The presidium consisted of Wu Yunzhai, Chu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yang Caoxian, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Zhaoyuan, Xu Qiufan, and Jiang Zhengchan. The general directors were Chen Peide and Han Jingqi, and the secretary was Yin Rangneng. First, the Guangci Hospital orchestra played music, followed by the entire assembly bowing three times in a birthday salutation. Chairman Wu Yunzhai delivered a congratulatory speech and read Mr. Ma's thank-you telegram. Mr. Yang Caoxian, a 101-year-old, as well as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Jin Tongyin, gave speeches. Jiang Kesheng reported on Mr. Ma's virtues and career. Mr. Ma's great-grandson, Zhang Chongren, delivered a thank-you speech. Afterwards, a group photo was taken, and birthday bowls, birthday badges, and gifts were distributed, accompanied by performances such as New Asia national martial arts, amateur Peking opera, and Chinese music magic by the Hualian Association. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Chairman's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Yunqi delivered the opening address, stating briefly that today, the fellow villagers from Dan, Jin, Liyang, and five other counties initiated this birthday celebration, and all sectors of society participated in unison, demonstrating respect for both his age and virtue, and the admiration of all. Only those with great virtue can enjoy a long life. Mr. Ma's morals and career are known to all and need not be elaborated. He continued his congratulatory speech, saying, "I once heard of Lin Lei, whose lifespan reached the expected end. My Mr. Ma's virtue and prestige surpass him. With a yellow beard and white hair, he is a great elder of the nation. He is both respected and stern, a truly outstanding teacher. Mr. Ma's scholarship encompasses everything. Interpreters translate and transmit with diligence. Mr. Ma's conduct is upright and exceptional. He follows principles like spring and autumn, harmonizing with the spirit of purity and integrity. When summoned to the imperial court, he was granted a comfortable carriage and soft cushions, demonstrating exceptional courtesy to set an example for the people. In these extraordinary times, he maintains calmness. Unyielding to power, his achievements are remarkable. Moving from Hubei to Guangxi, he has relocated several times. Recently, he has retired in Hanoi, nurturing his nature and embracing truth, speaking and laughing freely, relying on his staff and shoes in the spring breeze, appearing even more robust. I humbly hear that a blessed day has arrived. I respectfully offer a cup of wine, wishing him health and longevity from afar. I am privately fortunate that we share the bond of being fellow villagers. Heavenly honors are equally respected, namely virtue and age. May he enjoy the blessings of the ninth and fifth, and the longevity of the sacred tree of eight thousand years. Mr. Ma embodies both longevity of life and longevity of impact on the world."</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests</p>
<p>Yang Caoxian then delivered a speech, saying, "I am not good at speaking, please forgive me. Mr. Ma's personality is exemplary, and we must emulate him, so as not to fail this grand gathering today. I am useless to society, specializing in odd jobs. Please everyone work hard and use the old man as a model." Yu Qiaqing followed, saying, "Mr. Ma's morality involves doing things for society and is admired by all. Today, the whole country celebrates his birthday. It is fitting that we have Mr. Yang Caoxian here. The two Mr. Ma and Yang mutually illuminate each other. It shows that longevity cannot be obtained only by taking medicine, but by doing many good deeds. I hope everyone pays attention to morality and jointly reaches the realm of longevity." Then, Jiang Kesheng from Danyang reported, stating briefly, "Of the five blessings, longevity comes first and is most difficult to obtain. Mr. Ma's longevity has three internal conditions, namely, love for the country, love for his hometown, and love for people. It also has three outward manifestations, namely, establishing virtue, establishing words, and establishing merit. To summarize, it is learning and righteousness. Mr. Ma's knowledge spans Chinese and Western cultures, and he is skilled in preserving his health. Therefore, he can enjoy a long life and make great contributions to society and the nation." Next, Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Today's gathering is the first I have seen in my life. The weather is often bad during Qingming Festival. An ancient poem says, 'During the Qingming season, rain falls in torrents.' Today, the weather is also helping. Mr. Ma is selfless and most admirable. Although Mr. Ma is not in Shanghai, it is especially rare that the 100-year-old Mr. Yang Caoxian is present. If you all take Mr. Ma as a model, you will surely enjoy a long life." Then, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech, saying, "Mr. Ma is now in Lang Son. Today, we send our congratulations from afar. We not only wish him longevity but also wish him progress in thought for millions of years." Next, Jin Tongyin, a representative from Fudan University, delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Mr. Ma successively founded Aurora and Fudan Universities. At that time, there was a thirty-year age difference between students. Mr. Ma was able to make students of all ages get along harmoniously, which is most admirable. At present, we must unify our national thinking. Although Mr. Ma is old, his thinking is extremely new. Recently, someone came from Lang Son and said that Mr. Ma even has the appearance of returning to youth." Then, Wu Zhaoyuan delivered a speech, saying, "It is rare to live to be a hundred years old, but ordinary people often speak of a hundred years for birthday celebrations, which is inevitably too limiting. I wish Mr. Ma boundless longevity and also wish you all boundless longevity." Then, Yang Gonghe from the same village delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Mr. Ma, during the late Qing Dynasty, returned to Zhenjiang to advocate for the establishment of new policies, but his aspirations could not be realized. The relocation of the provincial government to Zhenjiang in the Republic, the construction of roads, and the development of transportation were all the same as Mr. Ma's plans from thirty years ago. An ancient saying says, 'The benevolent are long-lived.' The fundraising for birthday celebrations now is the meaning of 'the benevolent are long-lived.'" Then, Shen Kuibo from the same mountain delivered a speech, stating briefly, "Mr. Ma's way of preserving his health can be divided into two aspects, body and mind, namely, staying away from sensuality, wealth, and profit, and having a heart to eliminate evil completely." Then, Zhang Chongren, the representative of Mr. Ma's family, delivered a thank-you speech, stating briefly, "When I came to Shanghai from Lang Son, Mr. Ma had already heard that fellow villagers in Shanghai were preparing a public celebration and raising funds to help refugees. He asked me to convey his gratitude on his behalf."</p>
<p>Telegram of Congratulations from the Assembly</p>
<p>"To Mr. Ma Xiangbo in Hanoi, with utmost respect. I have learned of your good health. You have reached a hundred years of age, and your virtue shines brightly. You are a national treasure and a model for humanity. We wish you boundless longevity from afar. Shanghai Public Celebration of 100th Birthday Assembly kowtows, Fish."</p>
<p>Broadcasting Situation</p>

<h3 id="e55">Relief Committee: Concern for Shanghai's Refugee Compatriots; Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Inspection and Condolences; Decides to Allocate 100,000 Monthly for Relief <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, concerned about the situation of refugees remaining in Shanghai, specially dispatched Secretary Lin Xiaogu from Hong Kong to Shanghai, to visit various shelters and convey the government's condolences on its behalf. In the future, the Central government will allocate 100,000 yuan monthly to supplement relief funds. The details of each are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspecting Each Place, Comforting Refugees</p>
<p>Since the domestic migration following the Shanghai War, refugees from various places have flocked here, numbering as many as tens of thousands. Uprooted and impoverished, they face extreme hardship. Although various charitable organizations have tried to accommodate them, supplies are insufficient, and starvation is a concern. Mr. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, deeply concerned, allocated 100,000 yuan to be remitted to Shanghai for relief. Meanwhile, Mr. Yu Qiaqing led various sectors to organize the Refugee Relief Association to oversee relief matters. With the enthusiastic donations from various sectors, the results have been quite good. It is now known that Mr. Xu Shiying, concerned about the refugees in Shanghai, specially dispatched Secretary Lin Xiaogu to arrive in Shanghai via the inner harbor a few days ago. He immediately visited Mr. Chu Qiaqing and Mr. Huang Hanzhi, expressing his condolences for Yu and others' leadership in relief efforts. In recent days, he visited various refugee shelters on Dunxin Road and other places in the city to inspect the content of each shelter's operation and the living conditions of the refugees. He also conveyed the government's and Mr. Xu's condolences to the refugees on his behalf. The general refugees expressed their deep gratitude for the Central government's earnest concern.</p>
<p>Monthly Plan to Remit 100,000 to Shanghai for Relief</p>
<p>After inspecting various shelters in the city, Mr. Lin, in addition to expressing satisfaction with the operation of each shelter, also provided guidance on points that should be improved. According to a report by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the Central Relief Committee has now decided, starting this month, to allocate 100,000 yuan monthly to be remitted to Shanghai to serve as relief expenses, to show the government's deep concern for the refugees. The method of distribution has already been agreed upon as follows: 35,000 yuan for the Refugee Relief Association, 30,000 yuan for the Charitable Organizations Joint Relief Association, 10,000 yuan for the Nanshi Refugee Area, and 15,000 yuan for the Cilian Relief Branch. It is reported that Mr. Lin, having completed his official duties, boarded a ship yesterday to return to Hong Kong to report.</p>

<p>The Dalu Daily reports that, according to the Japanese Dalu Shinpo yesterday (5th), the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department posted a recruitment notice in Tokyo two months ago for thirty Japanese police officers and Japanese police departments. Initially, there were many applicants. However, when the employment examination was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last Tuesday and Wednesday, only seventy Japanese youth took the exam. A certain Japanese, the Deputy Police Chief of the Police Department, is now the chief examiner in Tokyo. Physical examinations will be held for two days during the examination period, and written examinations will be held on Wednesday.</p>

<p>On the 24th of last month, the Public Works Department's Selection Committee unanimously decided to request the Bureau to extend the temporary measures for issuing cost of living allowances to employees from April for three months and to reconsider it in June. The above proposal has been passed by the Bureau's Board of Directors on the 5th of this month.</p>

<p>Liu Tiecheng and Du Tianpeng, bandits from Pubei Beicai, have been committing all kinds of evil since being enlisted by the Japanese. A few days ago, they even crossed the Pu to the old cloth shop of Jiuji Wharf in Nanshi, extorting 1,000 yuan from the shop owner, throwing a threatening letter and instructing him to contact them in Beicai. The shop owner ignored them. On the third day, three bandits came and kidnapped the shop owner across the Pu. In the end, he was redeemed for 500 yuan. The armed kidnapping of the merchant passed through the Japanese sentry area, but they remained indifferent.</p>

<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that several leaflets have been pasted on the walls between Penang Road and Jessfield Road opposite Rue Robert in western Shanghai. These leaflets fiercely attack the National Government and discredit Britain's policy in China. There are also leaflets slandering Chinese leader Chairman Chiang on Yinghua Street near Jiujiang Road. It is widely believed that these leaflets were distributed by pro-Japanese groups at their expense. Some of those related to the distribution of anti-British leaflets are pro-Japanese Chinese "governments" that have recently launched a movement to incite anti-British sentiment among the Chinese masses. Anti-British demonstrations have also been held near Kaifeng. These propagandists are still engaged in propaganda in the Shanghai area, even invading the Public Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e60">After the Lockdown of Zhenhai Port, the Waterway is Still Not Blocked; Various Parties Still Plan to Request the Authorities to Maintain Transportation; Vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line are Temporarily Rerouted to Wenzhou <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>After Ningbo Zhenhai Port was ordered to be locked down at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line has been completely cut off. However, the gap in the blockade line has not been blocked. The old Taiping is still berthed at the Xinjiangtian Wharf in Ningbo, and has not moved. Various parties still plan to request accommodation to maintain transportation and to selectively dispatch ships. The original ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have been temporarily rerouted to Wenzhou. The details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Industry Talks About the Truth of the Blockade</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo Defense Command received the telegram order from Chairman Chiang and announced the blockade of Zhenhai Port at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhejiang people in Shanghai have been extremely concerned. Those who are generally nervous have recklessly speculated and have groundless fears about the safety of Ningbo. However, according to a shipping industry magnate, the situation in Ningbo is currently very peaceful. There are no traces of Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port. As for the sudden announcement of the blockade this time, the Japanese warships have repeatedly shelled the Zhenhai Fortress in the past month, and the people in the urban area were quite uneasy. Therefore, they suggested that the authorities request the blockade of Zhenhai Port to prevent Japanese harassment. At the same time, the Defense Command also believed that the situation at that time was indeed very tense and believed that blocking the river was necessary. They reported the situation to the Military Commission for verification. The approval telegram was received on the 4th. However, according to the recent situation, there is actually no need for the blockade. It is only because of the order that they cannot resist it. Therefore, they announced the blockade starting on the 5th.</p>
<p>The Waterway Has Not Been Blocked</p>
<p>After the Defense Command announced the blockade of the Ningbo River traffic from the day before yesterday, all foreign ships remaining in Ningbo, including De Ping, Shan Tai, Hana, New Beijing, and Mou Fu, left Ningbo before 3:00 PM. They arrived at the port one after another yesterday morning. According to the crew of the Mou Fu, the ship left Ningbo at 2:20 PM, which was the last one. At that time, the old Taiping, which was preparing to be sunk for the blockade, was still berthed at the Xinjiangtian Wharf on the north bank of the river and had not moved. The Ningbo authorities had not heard of any intention to actually sink the ship. As for today's (i.e., yesterday's) report that "the Taiping will be sunk immediately after each ship leaves, etc.," it seems to be speculative. Also, Mr. Ren Shuntong, the ship owner of the Taiping, is currently in Shanghai. After hearing the news of the river blockade, he was quite concerned about the sinking of the Taiping. He immediately sent a telegram to inquire. According to the reply, he also said that he had heard nothing. Therefore, the gap in the blockade line of Zhenhai Port (i.e., the waterway) has not been completely blocked so far. According to the observation of the shipping industry, unless necessary, the ship will not be sunk.</p>
<p>Various Parties Still Request to Maintain Transportation</p>
<p>After Zhenhai Port announced the blockade and prohibited ships from entering and exiting, Shanghai-Ningbo shipping was completely cut off from 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. People from Shanghai and Ningbo believe that the transportation obstruction will greatly affect the commerce of the two ports and is closely related to the people's livelihood. Moreover, Ningbo is in severe food shortage and relies on supplies from other provinces. Now that it is blocked, the source has been cut off, and the people's food is especially feared. Recently, Ningbo has purchased a large amount of wheat flour, which has been loaded onto the Endeavor to be transported to Ningbo. However, due to the blockade, it cannot be transported. Therefore, all parties concerned still plan to request the authorities to allow the selective dispatch of ships during the blockade period to maintain transportation and transport necessary goods to regulate the situation. It is reported that the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Association are also discussing it.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Ships Rerouted to Wenzhou</p>
<p>The ships originally sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line have now been temporarily rerouted to Wenzhou due to the Zhenhai blockade. Italian De Ping and Portuguese Meda are scheduled to sail directly to Wenzhou this morning. Others, such as German Mou Fu, American Hana, and Tang Sai, are also scheduled to sail to Wenzhou tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. As for the Portuguese Shan Tai, it plans to take the opportunity to enter the dock for repairs. The British New Beijing may be rerouted to Tianjin. At present, the number of ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, including the original Mei Fa, Tang Lu, Tang Qiao, Hai Fu, Bao Li, Hai Long, and Fei Kang, totals more than ten.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Under Special Circumstances, the Shanghai Customs Administration is Damaged; Difficulties in Implementation Reported Based on Facts; Export Tax Rates are Handled According to Government Regulations <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Luo Fude, the Commissioner of Customs of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs after the fall, forced by the environment, changed the import tax rate under these special circumstances. As for the export duty exemption exceeding the slight tax, it is because the government encourages the tax-free export of domestic goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Duty Exemption Exceeds Taxation</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs' export tax collection in August 1938 was 6,300,620 yuan, duty exemption was 14,894,263 yuan, slight tax in September was 9,474,771 yuan, duty exemption was 18,145,985 yuan, tax collection in October was 8,241,598 yuan, duty exemption was 14,660,309 yuan, tax collection in November was 10,026,600 yuan, duty exemption was 20,193,813 yuan, tax collection in December was 10,435,25 yuan, duty exemption was 17,514,399 yuan, tax collection in January 1939 was 11,384,241 yuan, duty exemption was 19,422,184 yuan, and slight tax in February was 10,531,048 yuan, duty exemption was 18,641,536 yuan.</p>
<p>Measures Under Special Circumstances</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Customs yesterday that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, after the withdrawal of the National Army from Shanghai, the tax revenue was intercepted and deposited in the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank, and Japanese customs officers were added. The flag was forced to be changed, and the import tax rate was reduced. Although it is nominally the Chinese Customs and is under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General of Customs, in reality, the Shanghai Customs administration has been damaged. Regarding the export of domestic goods, foreign exchange should be settled, and the prohibition of goods used to support Japan, Inspector General of Customs Meier and Feng Zhibu issued orders to Jianghai Customs to comply. Commissioner Luo believed that there were difficulties in implementation and reported that he could not comply. It is said that he has obtained the understanding of the Inspector General of Customs.</p>
<p>Encourage Tax-Free Export of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The value of export goods taxed in various customs offices in China is more than duty-free, but the Shanghai Jianghai Customs is the only one that is the opposite. The outside world is very unclear about the truth, but in fact, the export tax of Jianghai Customs has not been changed after the war, and is handled according to the tax rate stipulated by the government. Because Shanghai has always been the center of industry and commerce in the country, with numerous factories of domestic goods and a place where native goods are concentrated for export, the government has ordered that the export of machine-made domestic goods and major native goods should be exempted from tax to encourage the export of machine-made domestic goods and major native goods. Therefore, the export goods of Jianghai Customs, duty-free goods exceed the slight tax, of which 70-80% of duty-free goods are machine-made domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Shanghai Landlords Association Advocates for Eliminating Subletting Abuses; Hopes the Authorities will Solve the Transportation Problem; So that Landlords in the Northeast District can Return to their Former Residences <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Zilin Daily reports that the Shanghai Landlords Association held its annual meeting at the British Commercial Broadcasting Company yesterday (the 5th). Chairman Mei Lu appealed to all landlords to eliminate the subletting abuses prevalent in densely populated Shanghai. He also criticized the current situation in the western district of the city, the delay in opening the eastern and northern districts, and the lack of transportation convenience in these two districts. Mr. Mei said in his speech that the membership has increased since the last annual meeting, but there is still room for improvement. He hopes that individuals and stores related to real estate who are not currently members of the association will understand the benefits that can be gained from this organization and join. The founders of this association intended to make it an international organization. Last year, my conclusion was that we would make strong representations to the Public Works Department regarding the problem of refugees occupying members' properties. This has been done, and the Public Works Department has subsequently added shelters, and many members have been able to use their properties. Members are aware that the tenants of their properties,</p>
<p>Overcrowded , subletting and transfer of tenancies, must pay huge sums of money. Landlords generally do not know or approve in advance. Landlords should do their best to eliminate this abuse. Due to the situation outside the western district and the western district of the Public Concession, this association was established last year. If the eastern and northern districts of the Public Concession are opened, the population congestion in the two concessions south of the Suzhou River and the shocking situation outside the western district will undoubtedly be improved. This matter and lack</p>
<p>Convenience of transportation The authorities and relevant public convenience companies have repeatedly paid attention, but when these two problems have not been satisfactorily resolved, the former residents and small industrial landlords will not return to their original residences in the northern and eastern districts. I know that the Public Works Department police officers in these two districts have increased in order to restore residents' confidence, but unfortunately the transportation problem has not been solved.</p>

<p>The guerrillas controlling the Shanghai-Xichang Highway have now further blocked the highway to cut off Japanese military transportation. In the past, the Japanese side relied on this road for supplies. Now it has lost its effectiveness. Regular Chinese troops have arrived in Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, and other areas one after another and are uniting with guerrillas and local forces to prepare to severely attack the Japanese army and wipe out the remaining enemies in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Trample on the Local Area</p>
<p>Xu Pu'cheng's unit of the puppet "Pacification Army" opened from the Jiaxing area to Hongqiao in western Shanghai, and rape and looting occurred every day. The villagers, unable to bear the puppet troops' trampling, relocated one after another. Unexpectedly, the puppet "army" became more intensified. Suddenly, on the evening before yesterday (the 4th), they colluded with a large group of bandits and carried out large-scale looting. The villagers who were unable to escape were spared. The next day (the 5th), the guerrillas learned of Xu's unit and went to attack. The puppet "army" did not dare to resist and abandoned their weapons and fled. Three puppet "army" leaders were captured on the spot and executed that evening. The people applauded and cheered when they heard the news.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Fleeing from Sijing</p>
<p>Sijing Town in western Shanghai is an important route from Songjiang to Shanghai and has a highway that runs through Shanghai. The town is garrisoned by more than 40 soldiers from the Japanese garrison team, Heida's team. Yesterday evening (the 5th), it was suddenly attacked by guerrillas. The fierce fighting lasted for several hours. The Japanese army was defeated and collapsed. The remaining enemies fled toward Songjiang. In this battle, seven Japanese soldiers were killed and more than a dozen drowned in the river. The town is now controlled by the guerrillas.</p>

<p>Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, arrived in Shanghai with his wife on the Canadian Empress from Japan. He arrived at the port at 12:30 PM on the 5th. He was greeted by Philip, the British Consul General in Shanghai, and others. They then took an embassy car to Ambassador Cole's residence on Dunxin Road. At the invitation of Ambassador Cole, they had dinner at the Ambassador's residence, accompanied by Consul General Philip. According to Ambassador Craigie, this trip is a leisure trip using a vacation. However, the general view is that Craigie's arrival has political implications. Craigie's entourage is quite simple, with only two embassy staff members. According to Japanese newspapers, Ambassador Craigie will leave Shanghai on the Japanese ship Yasukuni Maru on Friday (today) to return to Japan after meeting with Sir Cole. However, according to Ambassador Craigie, he will have a week's stay in Shanghai. He will determine the date of his trip after Sir Cole goes to Chongqing. Generally speaking, the date of Ambassador Craigie's return to Japan must be after Ambassador Cole's meeting to obtain the results. The annual meeting of British business leaders in this port is scheduled to be held on the 15th. Yesterday, British business leaders in this port visited Ambassador Craigie on Dunxin Road one after another to report on British interests in China and the general situation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission handles the settlement and sale of foreign exchange for native goods. After purchasing the main native goods across the country and concentrating them in Hong Kong for export, and for the export of tung oil and other two or three types of native goods, foreign exchange must be sold and settled with China and Traffic Banks. Since its implementation, it has been quite successful. Now, because it is from the port to Hong Kong, a Foreign Exchange Administration Office has been specially established in Haikou, which has been implemented since the 20th of last month. All native goods exported from Haikou should also be settled in foreign exchange.</p>

<p>— Nanshan</p>
<p>Remembering the celebration of the birthday of the national elder statesman Ma Xiang, I went to the Ningbo Native Association on Rue Ratard yesterday afternoon at four o'clock to remotely offer my congratulations. When I arrived at the venue, there was already no empty seat. The 101-year-old Yang Caoxian and Elder Yu Qiaqing had all arrived. During this national crisis, Elder Xiang's long journey to the southwest has made those who went to celebrate admire the greatness of Elder Xiang's morality and literary talent; at the same time, they also feel who is making it impossible for us to share a hall with Elder Xiang in today's celebration!</p>
<p>In the middle of the venue, a silk banner of "A Ray of Light in a Dilapidated Temple" from the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and congratulatory couplets from the Zhenjiang Native Association were hung. The calligraphy of the 101-year-old Yang Caoxian is admired at home and abroad; and his works have been seen three times, one is the large-character "Longevity" congratulatory banner for the Refugee Cooperative, one is Elder Yang's congratulatory couplet "National Elder of China, Global Mentor," and one is the commemorative couplet "One Meeting, One Year Older; Centenarian Host, Centenarian Guest." The calligraphy is vigorous and can be called a masterpiece.</p>
<p>After Chairman Wu Yunqi gave a congratulatory speech, Elder Yang followed with a congratulatory speech. He can truly be called a white-haired youth. He delivered a fifteen-minute speech without showing any fatigue. He finally solemnly said: If everyone contributes to society with Elder Xiang's spirit for the nation and the country, then "who dares to deceive us?" Elder Yang repeated this sentence "who dares to deceive us" three times, and also encouraged Chinese compatriots to repeat it three times, which shows that Elder Yang's words were sincere and can serve as a model for young people.</p>
<p>The reporter visited Elder Yang in the venue. Although he is over a hundred years old, he walks as usual, and his hearing has not diminished. According to Yang, he is only half a year older than Elder Xiang, because Elder Xiang's birthday is in February, while his is in July. Elder Yang remarried and has three sons, the second of whom is already fifty-two years old this year. He said that he does not have a fixed time for waking up in the morning and going to bed at night, and his diet is also casual, with both meat and vegetables. As for the art of health preservation, he does not have any other exercises besides freehand exercises. After returning from overseas, he has been living in Xinmin Village on Malong Road in Shanghai. He feels that the air in Shanghai is still acceptable. Recently, he only feels that his hearing is slightly inconvenient, but when talking with the reporter, Yang was in high spirits. More than a dozen elderly people aged seventy or eighty were present in the venue, but their gait was healthy, and it seemed that none of them were as good as Yang. Although Yang's beard and hair are white, they appear healthier than the mottled beard and hair of ordinary eighty-year-olds. He wears a loose-fitting Chinese-style outer coat, which is fastened with a belt instead of buttons. His complexion is slightly ruddy. When he meets people, he bows at a ninety-degree angle, with a humble and amiable demeanor, making him the most admired person in yesterday's venue.</p>
<p>Those who participated in the celebration ceremony yesterday used their birthday gifts for refugee relief, and received souvenir badges and longevity bowls and chopsticks with Elder Xiang's calligraphy upon presentation of receipts. The gathering of young people in Western suits and leather shoes, elderly people with white hair, and young girls with rosy cheeks was truly an unprecedented grand occasion in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Firefight Between Puppet "Military Police" in Pudong; Puppet Self-Defense Corps Disbanded; Internal Conflict Due to Mutual Blame in the Case of Kidnapping the Owner of the Hua Hua Farm <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>A firefight occurred between the puppet "Military Police Team" and the puppet "Yangjing District Self-Defense Corps" in Pudong the day before yesterday afternoon. Several puppet "leaders" and others were imprisoned, and the puppet "Self-Defense Corps Headquarters" was taken over by the Japanese army. The puppet members fled. Detailed information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<p>Conflict Arises from Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Bandits and puppets are active in the area along the coast of Pudong. Since the kidnapping of Chen Yinying, the owner of the Qichangzhan Hua Hua Farm, last month, a huge ransom of 100,000 gold has been demanded, and he has not yet been released. The Japanese and puppet sides attach great importance to this case. The "Puppet Military Police Team" and the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" each have real responsibilities and blame each other, thus arousing suspicion. Both suspect the other party of being the kidnapper of Chen, and in front of the Japanese army, they attack each other, forming a major feud, with little chance of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Both Sides Open Fire</p>
<p>At one o'clock the day before yesterday afternoon, the puppet "Military Police Team" suddenly sent three puppet "detectives" to the Hua Hua Farm to inquire about whether the farm owner had been released. The puppet "Self-Defense Corps" learned of this and believed that the three were related to the kidnappers. More than ten puppet "members," including Yang Dabaozi and Xu Songlin, carried pistols and went to surround and arrest them. Two of the puppet "detectives" also had pistols and exchanged fire with each other. The puppet "detectives" were outnumbered. Two of them with guns fled west, and one puppet "detective" without a gun was captured by the puppet "members" and taken to the puppet "Corps Headquarters" for detention.</p>
<p>Puppet Corps Searches for Weapons</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the two puppet "detectives" who escaped reported to the puppet "Military Police Team." The puppet "Captain" then reported to the Japanese Zengtian Military Police Branch, accusing the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" of obstructing puppet "official duties" and detaining puppet "detectives." The military police team then sent more than twenty armed military police to search the puppet "Corps," obtaining an unlicensed six-inch pistol. They then tied up the puppet "Squad Leader" Chen Guotai and Cao Jinxiang with ropes and detained them along with the gun. The puppet "detective" who had been detained was released. They then went to search the puppet "Leader's" house and also found an unlicensed six-inch pistol in the residence of the puppet "Deputy Leader" Yao Jinxiang. They then believed that the puppet "Corps" was privately hoarding weapons and harboring evil intentions, and launched a large-scale investigation.</p>
<p>Two Puppet Leaders Arrested</p>
<p>At this time, the puppet "Head" Fan Futang and the puppet "Deputy Head" Yao Jinxiang separately reported to the Japanese Navy and the Xinhui Mountain Japanese Army because they did not understand the situation. Each sent more than two hundred soldiers to surround the Qichangzhan Town, cutting off traffic on Pudong Avenue. Seeing the Japanese military police present, the Japanese Navy and Army knew it was difficult to retreat. At the same time, the Japanese military police captain notified the Navy and Army departments to detain the puppet "Leaders" Fan and Yao. They were taken back to the military police team that night for detention.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Takes Over Puppet Corps</p>
<p>After the incident, more than one hundred puppet "members" fled. No one was in the puppet "Corps Headquarters" on the south street of Qichangzhan in a moment. The Fourth Squadron of the Japanese Navy sent a squad of soldiers to occupy the puppet "Corps" yesterday morning. All the puppet "documents and books" were copied by the Japanese military police. Therefore, the puppet "Police Corps," which was established in August, came to an end.</p>

<p>Japanese merchants attempted to monopolize the fresh pork industry, obstructing British ships from loading fresh pork in Jiangbei and other places, and forcing them to load it on Japanese ships and extorting fees. After the pork merchants firmly opposed, the pork transported by the British-owned Kristine Maersk wheel of Lai Ci Foreign Company and the Wuxue wheel of the British-owned Taikoo Company, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, initially stopped unloading pork due to the Japanese-owned Dalu Wuchan Company charging an extra fee of two yuan per head, causing a dispute. Although the fresh pork from the two ships has been unloaded, the dispute has not yet been resolved. The pork merchants have already held a meeting and resolved to unanimously oppose the extra fees, willing to sacrifice business if necessary, but hope that the Japanese merchants will voluntarily give up the attempt to monopolize and stop collecting extra fees.</p>

<p>Although it is a beautiful spring, with boundless spring scenery and colorful flowers. Although it is a happy spring, with affection and endless happiness! But for men with kidney deficiency, not only do they not have a share in these, but they also increase their spring sorrow and hatred, and instead complain about spring! This cannot be blamed either: a healthy couple, in the face of this beautiful scenery, will inevitably have deep affection and fly with joy, organizing a happy family and giving birth to clever children, living harmoniously, how beautiful and pleasant life is! On the other hand, a man with kidney deficiency, even if he has a beautiful wife, during this moonlit and breezy spring night, the couple's life will also be different dreams in the same bed, or even cause quarrels, love to break down, and the family falls into a tragic situation of discord, is this not a greater offense to spring?</p>
<p>What is even more serious is that if kidney deficiency is prolonged and not treated, the symptoms will worsen after warming in spring. All symptoms such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, nocturnal emission, incomplete development, thin sperm, and infertility will occur successively, then dying out, causing a yellow and thin face, premature aging, or even a disease and death, an early death, how similar is the crisis!</p>
<p>According to medical experts, the reason why men have kidney deficiency is mostly due to early self-abuse and nocturnal emission, or post-marital licentiousness and overwork, resulting in the exhaustion of the fluid from the reproductive glands. Therefore, the most effective treatment is to use the reproductive gland supplement method. This method was invented by Austrian physiology master Dr. Steinach. In clinical experiments, it has been effective in curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating, so it has shocked the modern medical community. However, the surgery is relatively difficult and cannot be popularized to the public. Later, continued experiments by great doctors such as (Jamst) James De extracted the reproductive gland hormone from strong animals such as orangutans and sea dogs, and replicated it into a preparation using scientific methods. In order to commemorate Mr. Steinach's invention, it is named "Steinach's Reproductive Hormone." The drug is for both men and women, and can be taken internally. The method of administration is simple. After taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood, and nourish the nerves within one day and night, exerting great power. If you can continue to take it, the above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. It can also increase body weight, increase appetite, and double your health. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemet's Semen-Solidifying Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that both the root and the branch can be treated, and the effect will be faster. If the patient is in this city, he can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and then use various latest scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery to ensure a cure.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Nocturnal Emission is a Termite of Health <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Being disease-free is a blessing, and health is really the most valuable thing for us. But many young people do not know the stakes and take health as a child's play. This is because young people are in the period of spring love, because of sexual curiosity, they first commit self-abuse, and then nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission is treated early, it can be harmless to health. The worst thing is that young people do not take nocturnal emission seriously. Excessive nocturnal emission causes accumulated blood to dry up.</p>
<p>The semen in our body is the most important endocrine gland, which functions to regulate metabolism, prosper development, and nourish various nerves. If the sperm is dry and the blood is exhausted, the metabolic function will inevitably decline, resulting in a yellow and thin face, and premature aging. If the development function is blocked, it will show incomplete development, short stature, and small genitalia such as fingers. The three major nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sex are weakened. All symptoms such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, back pain, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and scattered energy will occur successively. Not only will this kind of youth lose all health and accomplish nothing; Even in the marital life of passing on the family line, which is indispensable in life, it will not be complete and be hated by the wife! Therefore, it will fall into the most tragic situation in life! Therefore, young people with nocturnal emission should immediately realize this and seek early and thorough treatment. The most effective treatment is to take "Hemet's Semen-Solidifying Tablets." Because this medicine has the function of consolidating the sperm gate, calming the nerves, reducing dreams, and allowing you to sleep peacefully, the nocturnal emission will heal itself. If the above symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also prolong life. However, if the patient can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and then use various scientific therapies, he can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>

<h3 id="e77">The Breast Peak is the Vanguard of Female Fitness and Beauty <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Modern women with newer minds have abandoned their slender and weak qualities and value healthy beauty. Healthy beauty contains many conditions. Such as the plumpness and firmness of muscles, the proper proportion of body length, the plumpness and flexibility of the buttocks, etc. But the most important point is the breast peak.</p>
<p>The breast peak is valuable for its tall and elastic, slightly rising and falling when walking, which makes it appear more elastic and rich. Heterosexuals are unconsciously attracted to it, and there is a general idea of feasting on beautiful scenery and being absent-minded! However, this kind of beautiful breast peak will only be possessed by healthy women. Those women who are physically weak, congenitally insufficient, have irregular menstruation, and have lingering leukorrhea, because the endocrine of the ovary is insufficient, making it difficult to develop, how can the breast peak be tall and towering:</p>
<p>What is even more ridiculous is that there are many ugly women with shriveled breasts who wear bras to deceive themselves, but when the clothes are thin or the silk skirt is just untied, this ugliness will always be revealed immediately. Therefore, the smartest way is to rely on scientific medicine to seek remedy. According to the test of famous world gynecologist Kang Delin and others and myself, it is unanimously recognized that taking the ovarian preparation female "Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective and effective for the symptoms. Because this preparation is well prepared, after taking it, it can nourish the ovarian function within one day and night, prosper the metabolism, adjust menstruation, warm the uterus and stop the belt, and if you continue to take it, it is guaranteed to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and make the breast peak tall and red cheeks, turning ugliness into coquettishness.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Key to Curing Gonorrhea <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>No one does not know that gonorrhea is easy to spread and difficult to cure. But I do not know that the matter of curing gonorrhea is not as difficult as imagined by ordinary people, because the reason why gonorrhea becomes difficult to cure is due to the private abuse of ready-made music on the market and the general outdated mechanical surgery, I do not know that the gonorrhea poison is good at changing, and the condition is tortuous and subtle. It is necessary to have honest knowledge, rich experience, and the latest scientific methods to make a careful diagnosis. After diagnosing the root cause of the disease, and then adopting the most scientific method to make a thorough cure, then even the general doctor thinks it is difficult to cure white turbidity. I can definitely cure it completely.</p>
<p>Now, to speak frankly about the core of the problem of radical cure lies in whether the doctor is willing to be responsible for the treatment, and the patient is willing to be determined to receive treatment. The doctor's greatest task for general gonorrhea is to eradicate the pathogen... diplococcus, and the toxins produced by gonorrhea. The method of treating gonorrhea by general short-sighted doctors is nothing more than anesthetizing the nerves to stop the pain of acute gonorrhea and local surgery in order to clear the gonorrhea on the surface of the urethra. They do not know that the pain of acute gonorrhea is a physiological resistance function. If anesthetic needles and medicines are used, the body's own resistance will be reduced instead. As for local therapy, at most, it only eliminates some gonorrhea on the urethral mucosa, and it can never eradicate the gonorrhea in the deep parts and blood. As for general ready-made medicines on the market, it is even more unworthy of mention. Now, if the German-based gonorrhea flattening electrotherapy is adopted, the bactericidal power can penetrate into the lesion tissue, and the gonorrhea poison can be filtered. If it only kills bacteria and does not filter the poison, the patient will not be able to be cured quickly due to chemical changes. Others, such as Xi's serum, cooling method, massage method, and injection of self-bacterial vaccine, are also conditions for curing gonorrhea when used appropriately.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Encroaching on Silk Involves Family Affairs; Sister-in-Law Faints in Court; Sister-in-Law Objects to Younger Uncle's Marriage, Older Brother Even Removes Yun Di's Position <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Meihua Printing Factory at No. 2, Lane 412, North Zhejiang Road was established by Haimen native Fang Qixian, who raised funds, and Fang served as manager. His two younger brothers, Qichang and Qishou, also worked in the factory. Qichang, who was already a young man, relied on his brother and sister-in-law because both his parents had passed away. Last year, his sister-in-law tried to marry him a wife, but Qichang found it difficult to be satisfied with the object chosen by his sister-in-law and firmly refused. After that, he sought a partner on his own. Last month, he found a young woman from Ningbo named Zhang Cailing, who was 28 years old. They got along with each other and thought they could become life partners. They made an agreement to live together, but his sister-in-law did not agree and came out to obstruct it. Qichang did not want to succumb, so he proceeded with the marriage on his own. During the Chinese New Year, he completed the wedding ceremony and rented another house in Old Ning'an Lane, Haining Road, and did not live and cook with his brother and sister-in-law, hoping to avoid conflicts between sisters-in-law and brothers. However, Qixian's wife, seeing that her younger uncle did not respect her opinion, became angry and often slandered her uncle in front of Ye Zhan. Qixian also had a fear of his wife and, in order to comfort his wife's mood, dismissed his brother's job as a runner the month before last on the pretext of making his brother unemployed. Qichang suffered this blow and knew that it was difficult to maintain his life on an isolated island. The debt of 500 or 600 yuan for marrying a wife, since he lost his job, the creditors urged him to pay it back as urgently as fire. People were eager to make a living, and suddenly, at 9:00 pm on the 4th, he called Meihua Printing Factory, claiming that he had learned that someone outside said that the silk in the factory was all Japanese goods and would come to the factory for inspection, so he immediately hired a car to transport the goods to another place for storage. At that time, all the factory staff had gone out, and the person who answered the phone was his youngest brother, Qishou, an apprentice, so he could not cope. The two Xiang Sheng cars hired by Qichang had already arrived in front of the factory, and Qichang directed the car to take 67 pieces of silk from the factory and loaded them into two cars. Qichang called his wife, Zhang Cailing, to escort the goods to the clothing store opened by Wu Shiquan at No. 6, Lane 132, Park Road, and sold 12 pieces. The rest of the goods were transported to a rented house in a lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. That night, Qixian returned to the factory and was informed of everything by Qishou, so he reported to the Huishi Police Station and sent detectives Feng Qishan and Hu Guangrong to investigate. They learned that Qichang would go to Wu Shiquan's place the next day to sell, so they waited at Wu's house. When Qichang arrived, he was arrested and questioned. He learned that his wife was hiding in Room 325 of the Far Eastern Hotel and was also detained, and all the stolen goods were seized. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Because the goods of Meihua Factory were not missing, Fang Qixian was unwilling to confront his brother in court and did not personally file a case, but the factory director Zhang represented him in court to await instructions. However, when Judge Fang Qinghuan ordered Fang Qichang and his wife to stand in the defendant's position to be interrogated, Zhang Cailing suddenly fainted and fell to the ground, calling out and not knowing. The Chinese and Western detectives quickly helped her to sit in the hearing seat and gave her artificial treatment. As a result, she gradually recovered. The court then ordered her to sit next to her husband's defendant column. Then the trial began. First, Zhang Shizhu, the proxy lawyer of the police station, stated the fact that the defendant summoned Xiang Sheng cars to transport the factory's goods and prosecuted him for fraud, requesting a trial. Then, the factory's Zhang clarified that the silk goods were all delivered by Yong'an and Xinxin companies for dyeing. Then, Fang Qichang was questioned, admitting that he intended to sell the goods and get money to pay off debts, so he did this. His wife, Zhang Cailing, said that her husband did not tell her in advance, so she really did not know the truth. Judge Fang believed that it was necessary for the accuser Fang Qixian to be present in court, so he adjourned the case for another trial, and the defendant was sent back to custody and a warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>
<h3 id="e80">A Western Feat: Sailing to America in a Sailboat, Aiming to Reach the San Francisco Exposition in About 70 Days <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports: The first sailboat scheduled to sail from Shanghai to America this year is scheduled to set sail from the floating dock at the Garden Bridge at twelve noon today (the 6th), following the old trade route, making a non-stop voyage to the San Francisco Exposition. The captain, Anderson, has been a navigator for the Yangtze River Navigation Company for many years. Accompanying him are Anderson's wife, Zolek Kvitnik, and three Chinese crew members. The sailboat belongs to Mr. Mortimer of the Sino-American Book Company and is equipped with a 14-horsepower motor. Mr. Anderson believes that if all goes well, the entire journey can be completed in about 70 days. However, to prevent unforeseen circumstances, the ship has been equipped with two large water tanks, which can store enough water for several months of drinking, and will be stocked with food for five months, as well as a shortwave radio to receive weather signals. Mr. Mortimer of the Sino-American Book Company also intends to make the trip, if circumstances permit. Last year, he purchased three Ningbo fishing sailboats in Haimen and sailed them to Shanghai, where they were completely refurbished. Originally, he intended to leave Shanghai last year, but the construction of new decks, installation of engines, etc., took longer than expected, so the departure had to be postponed to the spring. Now Mr. Anderson has chartered the ship, and if the trip is completed successfully, the ship will be placed on display at the San Francisco Exposition. Afterwards, Mr. Anderson plans to travel to New York via the Panama Canal. If possible, he will sail the ship from New York to Finland when the World Games are held.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Rumored Puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwun Targeted in Assassination Attempt, One Shot Fired but Missed, Leading to Major Uproar in the Fake "Government" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>In the puppet "city government" in Jiangwan, another shocking incident occurred yesterday morning at 11 o'clock. The puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwun was almost killed by a bullet. At that time, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and a bullet passed through the window next to the puppet "Secretary's Office" into the room, grazing the top of Su's head, only two or three inches away, and lodged in the wall. Su was extremely frightened and fell to the ground, but was not injured. The puppet officials in the room rushed out to investigate and saw three puppet "guards" with guns in their hands, seemingly cleaning them. After a while, Japanese puppet "police" gathered after hearing the alarm. The puppet "Guard Captain" Chen Jintao disarmed the three puppet "guards" and detained them together, investigating whether they had conspired to assassinate Su. The entire puppet "government" was thrown into a major uproar. Since the assassination of Fu Xiaoan last winter, this is the second terrorist incident. According to another report, the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" "Secretary-General" Su Xiwun was almost assassinated at his residence a few days ago. Afterwards, the puppet authorities were extremely secretive, unwilling to reveal such matters to the outside world. It is said that on the morning of the 5th, at about 10 o'clock, Su was about to leave his residence on Avenue Foch in Hongkou to go to the puppet "government" to work. Unexpectedly, when Su stepped out of the gate, one of Su's drivers drew a gun and fired a shot at him, but missed. The second shot failed to fire because the bullet jammed. Su, hearing the gunshot, was shocked and fell to the ground. The many bodyguards behind him immediately surrounded the driver and captured him. Afterwards, Su had the driver detained in the puppet "government" and is now undergoing severe interrogation.</p>

<p>In Zikawei, west of Shanghai, the Shengyongxing Rice Shop was broken into by armed robbers at 12 o'clock last night, and clothing and other items worth about 300 yuan were looted. Also, the Huahua Store in the West Market was invaded by more than a dozen bandits at midnight last night. They emptied the store of all its tinfoil, cigarettes, clothes, and bedding. The robbers, still unsatisfied, repeatedly beat the owner three times, eventually extorting jewelry and valuables worth several hundred yuan. The owner suffered serious injuries to his back and waist. Next to the Deji gambling den in East Town, a rice shop opened for business yesterday. At 2 p.m., a large group of gangsters demanded money for "opening expenses." The shop owner slightly offended them in his words, and they fired a shot, wounding him in the leg. Because the town currently has no administrative organization, these villains are allowed to run rampant. After negotiations, they were forced to extort more than 80 yuan in legal tender before the matter was settled. It is said that there are seven or eight gangs of bandits gathered in the town, especially the followers of the Jiangbei gang leaders Little Nanjing, Stone Lao, etc., whose power is even more rampant.</p>

<p>Li Zuoheng, a 48-year-old vegetable vendor residing at 339 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, has a daughter named Li Aihua, 13 years old, who studies at the Dongxin Elementary School in the Yuli neighborhood. On January 5th, she was abducted from school and went missing. She was found on the 23rd of last month at No. 1 Annakin Court, Annakin Road. A report was made to the French Police, who found that the case was related to Li Wu, a fellow villager (27 years old) also known as Wu Ajin, residing at 29 Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road, and her lover Xie Runhui (25 years old, from Guangdong). Detectives were dispatched to arrest Wu and Xie and bring them to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. On January 5th, at the school, a friend of the girl's father, whose name she did not know, went to the school and tricked her, saying that her father was buying vegetables on Vegetable Market Street and could not carry them back, and asked her to go help him carry them back. The girl believed him and followed him. She was taken to No. 29 Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road. After giving the girl a cup of tea, she became disoriented. She was then sent onto a ship to Songjiang, where she was sold to the Hong family for 100 yuan. Later, because a guerrilla force and the Japanese army fought in the area, the Hong family fled, abandoning the girl at home. The girl, terrified, climbed onto the drying platform and was spotted by a neighbor, who asked her and learned that she had been abducted and sold there. The neighbor took pity on her and took her in. Later, the neighbor came to Shanghai and brought the girl with her. At the dock, she told the girl to go home on her own. The girl, not knowing the way home and suffering from hunger and cold, wandered and got lost, reaching the entrance of the Southeast Lane on Dagu Road, with nowhere to stay. She cried at the entrance of the lane and was found by a police officer surnamed Li, who took her back to his home to be cared for. On March 23rd, Li's wife, Zhou, had the girl accompany her to the home of a relative at No. 1 Annakin Court, Annakin Road to stay there. The girl was playing in the alleyway of Annakin Court with a child in her arms when a rice seller, who knew the girl's father, passed by and spotted her. He told the girl's father, Li Zuoheng, who reported to the French Police. Detective Jiang Zhongjia was dispatched to bring Li and Zhou and the girl Li Aihua to the police station. After questioning, it was learned that Li Wu and Xie Runhui, the lovers residing in Taihua Lane, North Jiangxi Road, were involved in the abduction case. Li and Zhou had good intentions in taking care of the girl and were not involved in the case, so they were released. Li Wu and Xie were detained for investigation. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Liao in the First Criminal Court. Lawyer Yuan Shouxi, representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that there was no evidence of involvement by the second defendant, Xie Runhui, and he would not be prosecuted. The first defendant, Li Wu, was charged with disrupting the family and luring a minor girl away from her family. When questioned, Li Wu absolutely denied knowing anything about the abduction and sale of the plaintiff's daughter. The court stated that the case required further investigation and ordered a rescheduled hearing on the 15th. Li Wu was remanded in custody, and Xie Runhui was released.</p>

<p>Xu Tingyu, the Nantong native factory manager of Shanghai Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, retained lawyers E Sen and Zhang Fayao in early summer of last year to file a suit with the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhu Gengtao, the factory's manager, and Zhang Zixin of Xinchang Cotton Cloth Company of colluding to embezzle and misappropriate funds, requesting investigation and punishment according to the law, and attaching a civil suit to recover the misappropriated funds. Xie Keming, the former factory manager of Renfeng Factory, also retained lawyers E and Zhang to sue Zhu Gengtao for embezzlement and misappropriation. The defendants retained lawyers Xue Dubi, Ma Shouhua, and Zhang Deqin for their defense. The two cases were originally handled by Judge Wu Kechou and Criminal Court President Liao respectively. Later, to facilitate the trial, the court transferred the two cases to Judge Qiu Huanjing for consolidated hearing. After repeated court sessions, witnesses were summoned and questioned, and accountants were jointly appointed by the three parties to investigate the accounts. From the filing of the suit to the present, nearly a year has passed. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper many times.

<p>The Social News Agency reports: Recently, in Shanghai, there have been unscrupulous individuals falsely using the names of patriotic organizations to forcibly extort money from people. These degenerates of the nation and the race are a hindrance to the reputation of our genuine patriotic organizations. For example, in the middle of last week, four major companies on Nanjing Road in this city suddenly received an official letter under the name of the "Second Division of the Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese Iron-Blooded Army," requesting subsidies from the four major companies. Although the companies were unwilling to reveal the wording of the letter, it is known that the content was clearly extortion under a false name. The letter also stated that they should contact a certain tycoon in this city. After investigation, the tycoon did not recognize the persons named in the letter, nor was there any contact. According to general speculation, this may be someone using this name to undermine the credibility of the national army, which is also within expectations.</p>

<p>Fudan University, which moved to Chongqing, was previously rumored to have been ordered to be renamed National Xikang University. Yin Yiwen of the Shanghai campus has now received a telegram from Vice President Wu Nanxuan in Chongqing, stating that the name of Fudan must be retained, and the story of renaming it Xikang University has not been heard here and is absolutely unfounded. It is also heard that President Li of the school will convene a meeting of the school's directors and alumni association in Shanghai within days to report on everything.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Full Text of the Resolutions of the Third National Education Conference (I): Proposals for Improving Educational Administration (Part 1) <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— (Dispatch from Chongqing by Shen Bao Special Correspondent via Airmail)</p>
<p>(Shen Bao Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference, convened by the Ministry of Education from March 1st to 9th, had more than 300 proposals, printed into four large volumes, as thick as one and a half feet, which shows the richness of its content. Now, after half a month, the conference has sorted out all the resolutions passed at the meeting by category and formed various educational improvement programs. The reporter obtained them and reported them to the readers of this newspaper, so that colleagues in the education field can get a glimpse of the full picture of the resolutions of this conference and refer to them at any time, but those that cannot be published for the time being will be omitted.</p>
<p>Proposals for Improving Educational Administration:</p>
<p>(I) Regarding Revising the School System: After the school system was promulgated by the former Ministry of Education in November of the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), it was amended by the First National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), but it was not promulgated. Now, in reference to the current school laws and regulations and actual needs, the following points are proposed for revision: (1) Within the secondary education stage, in addition to the original 3-3 system middle school, a six-year middle school will be established, without distinguishing between junior and senior high school. (2) In addition to the affiliated simple normal department, the original 3-3 system junior high school may also have an affiliated simple vocational department, enrolling junior high school graduates. (3) Within the higher education stage, in addition to the original two-year and three-year vocational schools, a five-year vocational school will be established, enrolling junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic ability to junior high school graduates.</p>
<p>(II) Regarding the Division of School Districts for Secondary and Higher Education:</p>
<p>(1) Each province should consider local transportation, population, economy, culture, and the distribution of existing secondary schools to divide the province into several middle school districts, several normal school districts, and several vocational school districts. (2) The number of secondary schools in each district of the province should be appropriately allocated. As a principle, each middle school district should have at least one middle school. Each normal school district should have one normal school or rural normal school and several simple normal schools or simple rural normal schools or simple normal departments, and should also establish a women's normal school or simple women's normal school, or establish a women's department in the normal school or simple normal school. Each vocational school district should have at least one vocational school or junior practical vocational school and several simple vocational departments. (3) The number of classes to be established in each type of secondary school, normal school, and vocational school in each district of the province, and the number of new students to be enrolled each year, should be planned and managed according to needs. (4) The central government should consider local transportation, population, economy, culture, and the distribution of existing vocational schools and above to divide the country into several normal college districts and several university districts. (5) The number of vocational schools and above in each district of the country should be appropriately allocated (not limited to one province as one district). Vocational schools should be affiliated with universities as much as possible, and various specialized departments should be increased. Each normal college district should have at least one independent normal college or a normal college within a university as a principle, and each university district should have one university as a principle. (6) The departments to be established in vocational schools and above in each district of the country, and the number of new students to be enrolled each year, should be planned and managed according to needs.</p>
<p>(III) Regarding the Qualifications for Educational Administrative Personnel:</p>
<p>The qualifications for educational administrative personnel at all levels should be based on educational knowledge and experience. The central government should separately formulate and promulgate regulations on the appointment of educational administrative personnel.</p>
<p>(IV) Regarding Educational Administrative Agencies Below the Provincial and Municipal Levels:</p>
<p>(1) The departments and offices and the number of staff members established by the educational administrative organs of each province and city shall be uniformly stipulated by the Ministry of Education. In provinces and cities with more abundant educational funds, special departments should be set up by the education departments and bureaus to handle social education and physical education. (2) Each county education bureau or the education section of the county government should establish at least one staff member in charge of compulsory education and one staff member in charge of social education and physical education. (3) Each county district head, township head, and Lianbao (joint security) chief should be responsible for promoting educational administration. (This proposal is not finished.)</p>

<h3 id="e102">Second Shanghai Battle Between Canada and China: Overwhelmed the Giants Last Night; Ordinary Skills Result in 33 to 17; Canadian Team Will Compete with the American Children Again at 7 PM Tonight <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Kobe Canadian-Chinese team, after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, had a contest with the American Children team. At 8:30 last night, they competed again with the Western Youth Giant team at the Western Youth Gym. There were only about two hundred spectators. In the game against the American Children team the night before last, the Canadian-Chinese team's performance was unusually poor, presumably due to the fatigue of the journey. Last night's performance seemed to have returned to normal, but the mediocrity of their skills cannot be denied. The Giant team's fatal weakness lies in their inability to shoot accurately. Individually speaking, Haiggett of the Canadian-Chinese team is quite nimble, and J. Crockett is steady, but too dull, and the rest are mediocre. Ai Liqu of the Giant team is better, and the rest are also mediocre. The battle was uneventful and ended lightly. In conclusion, the Canadian-Chinese team defeated the Giant team 33 to 17. At 7 PM tonight, the Canadian team will compete with the American Children team for the second time at the school. The results of yesterday are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Western Youth Volleyball Group A: Sea Youth vs. Today's Door Russian Overseas Chinese <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>There will be a total of three volleyball games tonight at Western Youth, starting at 7:15 PM. The first game is the women's group: Key team vs. Western Youth. Western Youth has a better chance of winning. The second game is Group A: Russian Overseas Chinese vs. Sea Youth. Sea Youth has an extremely high record in Group A, and the call for the championship is particularly high. Even the defending champion Russian Army team was defeated. Their strength is indeed strong. In particular, Zheng Yiquan's smashing is almost always a sure point. Although Russian Overseas Chinese A is not weak, it may be difficult to win against them. The last game is also Group A: Paramount vs. Western Youth. Western Youth has the famous player Borokhokov, and has not lost since the start of the competition, and is at the top of the group with Sea Youth. Paramount's strength is mediocre, and it is difficult to expect victory. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Western Youth vs. Key Team (Women) 7:15 PM</p>
<p>Russian Overseas Chinese vs. Sea Youth (Group A) 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Paramount vs. Western Youth (Group A) 8:30 PM</p>

Singles matches in groups 1, 3, and 5 were held. In the first group, Sun Jialu vs. M. Kokling first took the stage. Sun took the first game with a strong performance, winning 21 to 10. In the second game, Kokling actively counterattacked and took the lead. Sun was tied by Kokling with 21 to 18 after a hard battle, and then lost the third game with 4 to 21. In the third group, Chen Lin'an vs. Wam followed. Chen was originally a brave general, but recently suffered from stomach problems and neglected practice, resulting in a 12 to 21 failure in the first game. In the second game, he won back with 21 to 19, but in the third game, he was given the final victory by Hua with 21 to 16.

<h3 id="e107">This Year's Davis Cup Tennis Tournament: China is Extremely Optimistic; Xu, Cai, and He Will Divide and Resist the Great Powers <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>External News: In this year's Davis Cup International Tennis Championship, Dongying (Japan) deliberately showed leisure and sent a team to join. China was unwilling to lag behind and also rose up to participate. The most gratifying thing is that the representatives are well-selected, and the team is composed of Xu Chengji, Cai Huiquan, and He Renxuan, who are currently studying in Europe and participated in Wimbledon last year. It is planned that Xu Chengji will take on the first singles, Cai Huiquan will be the second singles player, and He Renxuan will cooperate with Xu Chengji to form a doubles team. The strength is strong, and it can be said to be unprecedented for the Chinese tennis team. China has a bye in the first week, but in the second week, they will face France, which has new masters and the veteran Bouro Tola. If they can pass this difficult hurdle, they will play the third week and then enter the fourth week. Because they can last two weeks, they will inevitably meet England. Since Pan Lai switched to the professional world, England has lacked successors and its strength has declined. It is found that Xu Chengji of China defeated the British master Austin by a score of 2 to 1 in the final of the British Open Hard Court Tennis Championship. From this, it can be known that Xu can be expected to win if he meets Austin again. Also, Cai Huiquan has won various championships in England. If the two of them strive to win three games in the singles, then England will have to bow down to us, and the prestige of Chinese tennis will shake the world. The orders for the first and second weeks are translated as follows:</p>
<p>First Week's Order</p>
<p>Yugoslavia vs. Ireland</p>
<p>Romania vs. Hungary</p>
<p>Poland vs. Netherlands</p>
<p>Germany vs. Switzerland</p>
<p>Second Week's Order</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia vs. Norway</p>

<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>Except for longevity like that of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, which we should celebrate, others are unnecessary. As for general congratulations and condolences, I also think it's perfectly fine to wait until after the victory of the war of resistance to express these feelings of sorrow and joy. That's what I said yesterday. Today, I'll add one more sentence: Around this Qingming Festival, general memorials or sacrifices can also be omitted, for the same reason that there's no need to celebrate, congratulate, or offer condolences now.</p>
<p>However, today, thinking of this day, April 7th, we cannot but mourn. We cannot but mourn Dr. Liu Zhanen, who was assassinated by the enemy's dogs a year ago today, thus sacrificing his life! His death was entirely for the sake of the country and the nation, so even though we had no personal friendship with him, we have always commemorated him, and especially today, we want to mourn him. His admirable words and deeds, his warm heart and ancient ways, will forever be our model, and his unyielding spirit will shine forever in the history of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Our mourning for him is certainly not for his personal benefit, nor is it a pity that his life was not long and he did not enjoy himself. He sought benevolence and obtained it, so why should he complain? What we consider regrettable is that he had not yet reached the age of eighty or ninety when he met with disaster, causing great loss to the nation. Regarding this point, we who are still alive should also think about it. How should we carry on in the future to complete his unfinished aspirations?</p>
<p>I say: If we will tread in Dr. Liu's footsteps and carry on, then we are truly mourning him, actively mourning him; otherwise, it is just the same as usual, a routine matter, and it would be better to omit it!</p>
<p>However, in order to mourn Dr. Liu, we cannot but pay attention to the behavior of the other side, as well as the security of Shanghai. We often hear that the other side is putting pressure on the concession authorities, using the excuse that patriotic elements are disturbing the concession, and making various demands on the concession authorities. But what about themselves? Secret nailing frames and tying up are unnecessary to mention, and in the areas they occupy by violence, it is even more chaotic, forming anarchy. The attack on Dr. Liu was one example of these facts, and the unsuccesful attack on Yang Zaisan yesterday can be regarded as the most recent example. These actions of theirs truly make people feel that this world is hopeless!</p>
<p>Now that Dr. Liu has been dead for a year, their dark methods in the concessions have only become more and more intense. I think the wise concession authorities will certainly not allow them to be so unbridled in the end without decisive sanctions!</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Smile on a Rainy Day <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Kuangsha</p>
<p>The road was beaten into a mud dragon by the water, lying prostrate, crawling past the low eaves, extending to the end. The shadow of this reptile disappeared, revealing a wasteland—no, now it should be said to be a puddle. Some towering places have become small islands, and on the islands are built houses mixed with broken bricks and broken pieces of wood; a moldy and humid smell, mixed with the stench from the gutters, makes it hard to believe that life can reside here.</p>
<p>A shadowy and distressed face pressed into the sound of the rain, a pair of hopeful eyes slipped out of the broken eaves. He looked at the blurry footprints on the muddy road, believing that his older brother would run back from the muddy road.</p>
<p>If the weather was clear, he would also be a little hero, he could also roll around in the Suzhou River,捞些淌来的菜梗之类的东西；climb on the rafts to strip the bark off the tree bottoms, pick up foreign iron cans in the trash cans, and sneak through the barbed wire to pick up coal cinders. The rain trapped his little heart. His father was a rickshaw puller, and his mother? Where did she go? He heard that she went to work, but she had never come back. Anyway, he was done with his mother as soon as he was born, she never comforted him or held him. He and his older brother were a team, he couldn't do without his older brother.</p>
<p>He didn't know how much water was in the sky, the rain falling incessantly, as if to break the ground; the mud dragon was already immersed in the water, and the puddle was slowly rising to the edge of the hole.</p>
<p>Rain, rain, rain, mixed with the heavy sound of loaded trucks, rumbling past outside the barbed wire; the cargo loaded high seemed like a pair of majestic beasts, splashing the mud high.</p>
<p>He remembered these things very clearly: his older brother had the ability to run after the trucks, quickly poke a hole in the large bales loaded on the trucks, and quickly pull out a pile of cotton. The workers on the truck gave him a thumbs up and praised him:</p>
<p>"Good boy."</p>
<p>A pile of cotton was sold to the small shop for one cent, and if he had the chance, he could also earn a few cents.</p>
<p>When the patrolmen came, his older brother got whipped, and the cotton that he had earned with his life was confiscated.</p>
<p>"Brother, let's be patrolmen when we grow up."</p>
<p>"No!" His older brother was a little angry, "Who cares! We're going to do something else."</p>
<p>"We'll pull rickshaws, like Dad."</p>
<p>"I don't want to—I want to be a road builder, and build all the muddy roads well."</p>
<p>"Brother, I'll go too, we'll build all the roads well, and build this muddy dragon road especially well, as strong as iron, so we can walk on it easily."</p>
<p>A bare foot stepped on the mud dragon, leaving a mark, the mark was deep, powerful, and quickly advancing forward.</p>
<p>"Brother! Brother, you're back!"</p>
<p>Raindrops fell on his sparse hair.</p>

<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>"Time" is like a stream, from which I tell of treacherous rapids, where chaotic rocks cut off the water flow. Thus, old dreams are separated from me. I forget the calm water waves, the peaceful shores, the green mountains on the river, and the tranquility of the docks. The roar of the rapids fills my ears. The cliffs rise thousands of feet, forming sheer walls that block the sunlight. All around is bleak. I am imprisoned in a dark, deep pool. From "yesterday," I still cling to the fading wave marks. I reach out with questioning hands: the dark, rapid stream firmly locks this small boat, gloomy, dark, and forever?</p>
<p>"There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, no unending imprisonment." As if from the vastness of the towering mountains, someone's voice reminds me.</p>
<p>Wandering in an isolated realm, on a solitary island, six months of life in a watery region, like the setting sun fading into the sails at dusk. Riding in a small boat, stalled at the head of the rapids, rugged reefs, scattered like stars, cut off the old flowing water, causing me to lose warm memories. Even in these treacherous rapids, leisurely enjoyment is impossible. I feel the threat of dual locks—the imprisonment of time and space.</p>
<p>Silently and patiently, I watch the fallen leaves hiding in the soil, seeking warmth in the blankets. The distinct seasons tell me of changes. On withered branches, one or two new green shoots sprout. "It should be the spring of growth!" Bursting through the light cold lock, expanding the vitality of life. Spring, the season of growth, we can no longer silently hide, confined in prison, cramped under the yoke, enduring under tyranny, submitting to shackles, surrounded by traps, obeying the whip.</p>
<p>"Spring, the season of growth," every sinew coils like a silkworm crawling on a mulberry leaf. Gradually, I feel the necessity for the inner energy to erupt. Black wind, black mountains, black sky, surround me, circling with heat impossible. So, I will steer my small boat, break through these treacherous rapids, from the reefs, from the waterfalls, from the sobbing waves, from the monkey-crying shores.</p>
<p>Who can endure this! This cruel imprisonment? No freedom, no wandering, no crying or laughing, no sun, no warmth, no growth.</p>
<p>The wails of thousands of homes, the songs of barbarians in several places, the footprints of life, turning within a few square feet of earthen walls, so close and convenient to the edge of death. Ocher-robed, shaved-headed prisoners, locked by darkness and cold, their eyes dimmed by shame, their bodies abnormally numb. "Time" locks the old days, "time" also cuts off the distance.</p>
<p>Awakened dreams often cannot be trusted on the pillow. A sliver of spring light leaks through the line of sky between the stone walls. And so I remember: the light mist on the lake, the willow catkins in the riverside city, the deep flowers and trees of the Zen monastery, the "Grain Rain" in the mountains when picking tea...</p>
<p>As I yearn for the beauty of wandering, someone reminds me in my ear: "There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, no unending imprisonment."</p>
<p>And so I—</p>
<p>Cross the treacherous rapids, cross the rushing water, cross the deep pools. Black wind, black mountains, black sky, brush past my ears, receding behind me. I try to move a step to change shape, and I suddenly see green shadows and rosy clouds, morning breeze and rising sun.</p>

<p>Today is the first anniversary of Dr. Liu Zhan'en's death. I think all of Shanghai, no, all of China, is mourning him. We have two commemorative pieces here, one written by his student, which shows even more of Dr. Liu's greatness.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Remembering Principal Liu Zhan'en <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Dezhao</p>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of Principal Liu's death.</p>
<p>Although his physical body suffered the most despicable and brutal attack, his lifelong virtues and great spirit remain forever in our world. We often remember his words and deeds, taking them as a guiding light to examine and encourage ourselves.</p>
<p>Although our 'big family's' elder was murdered by the enemy, we, the tens of thousands of descendants and students, have not forgotten his profound teachings. He once said: 'Shanghai University is different from other schools. We are a "big family." I am the head of the family, and you are the children. I hope my children will have revolutionary ideas, disciplined behavior, and when facing the most difficult times, will not be afraid of difficulties, will not be懈怠, and will use a positive spirit to achieve all victories.'</p>
<p>He also said: 'One's outlook on life should be joyful; people should not be pessimistic. A pessimistic person is not only useless to himself but also an obstacle to the evolution of society. We must adhere to a revolutionary and disciplined life, unite as one, actively struggle, sacrifice the "small self" to achieve the "big self," serve society and the country, strive for the independence of the Chinese nation, international peace, and the happiness of mankind. Think big and start small in everything, breaking through this harsh and oppressive environment. We must do our best to exercise our bodies, pay attention to mental hygiene, and cultivate a physique and spirit that can withstand hardship.'</p>
<p>Regarding frugality and thrift, he believed that on occasions such as the 'September 18th' and 'January 28th' incidents, we must eat vegetarian food for one day and donate the money saved to the national salvation fund to relieve refugees and other charitable causes.</p>
<p>He advocated that we should go to the 'grassroots' and 'border areas' to serve, starting from nearby and extending to distant places, popularizing education so that out-of-school children, women, and adults can receive the minimum compulsory education.</p>
<p>We have not forgotten any of his teachings. Not only have we not forgotten, but we are also diligently carrying them out. We continue to establish civilian schools, vocational schools, and women's literacy schools, paying attention to raising the knowledge of the people and cultivating national concepts, so that everyone has a normal occupation, can serve society, and benefit the people.</p>
<p>Principal Liu, it has been a year since your death. Your personality is respected throughout the country. We hope that your spirit will always envelop your descendants and students, reminding us, as you did in life, to serve the country and society consistently, and to avenge you!</p>
<h3 id="e117">The So-Called "Small Talk" <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Li Song</p>
<p>Mr. Du Chongyuan tasted the flavor of prison bars because of "small talk about the emperor," and Mr. Yi Junzu caused a great storm because of "small talk about Yangzhou." Although these two incidents each have their positive and negative sides, they are the same in that they arose from "small talk." Mr. Yi's "small talk about Yangzhou" did offend the people of Yangzhou, so it caused serious litigation. However, Mr. Du's "small talk about the emperor" was completely based on facts, but the "friendly nation" used the excuse of insulting ×× to make representations, and as a result, Mr. Du suffered imprisonment, and *New Life* was forced to cease publication. "Small talk" does indeed have spatial and temporal difficulties.</p>
<p>Occasionally, during leisure time, inviting two or three close friends to play chess or brew tea and chat with each other is a small pleasure. Now, it has changed. Everyone has no leisure, and no one can or wants to do this. In such an environment, even if there is leisure, it is difficult to have such interest.</p>
<p>In the past, in Shanghai teahouses and taverns, one could freely talk about "the Three Officials Scripture," whether about ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign affairs, without any consequences. Nowadays? There would be a notice saying "Gentlemen, please do not discuss current affairs." On the streets, it is best not to talk about national affairs or military situations, otherwise, some "disappearance" might occur.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, there have indeed been many "small talkers" from the leisure class who have changed their usual bad habits and actually taken up the work they should be doing. They have run down from the teahouses and embarked on the road to national salvation. They have changed empty words into practical action. However, there are still some "gentlemen" who continue to criticize Zhang and discuss Li, their mouths full of national salvation and seeking relief, but the result is still a completely bystander attitude, unclear about the "spatio-temporality" of "small talk."</p>
<p>What is most heartbreaking is that before the war, the general ambitious and promising young people, he (or she) saw the environment becoming increasingly worse, and their will was depressed. Now, some of them have plates to lick and bowls to clean. Some spend their days in theaters, teahouses, or dance halls "talking idly." This not only deprives the work of resistance of many cadres but will also cause them to degenerate and harm society!</p>
<p>I believe that those who can talk cannot necessarily do, and those who can do do not necessarily have to talk. Acting before speaking is glorious, and speaking without acting is shameful. I hope that the general "small talkers" will no longer talk idly. "Small talk" in theaters, teahouses, or dance halls is the least instructive. I tell you: the current environment is different, and the times are different.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Talking about Mr. Ma Xiangbo <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>I cannot help but feel that life is like a dream. Yesterday was Mr. Ma's 100th birthday. I should offer congratulations to Mr. Ma belatedly.</p>
<p>I once studied at Fudan Public School, which at that time was located in the governor-general's office in Wusong. The principal was Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and the academic dean was Mr. Li Denghui. Mr. Denghui had returned from abroad not long before, and was accustomed to English, while he was unskilled in Chinese. Therefore, several teachers teased him, saying that Chinese people should speak Chinese, and that anyone who inserted a foreign word into a conversation should be fined one dime. Mr. Li was repeatedly fined, and the teachers laughed heartily. At that time, I was nearly thirty years old, probably the oldest of the students, but I only studied for one semester because of economic pressure. Thus, I dropped out and took up the career of a journalist. Therefore, I dare not sever myself from Mr. Ma's students, nor dare I exclude myself from Mr. Ma's students.</p>
<p>I once heard Mr. Ma give a graduation speech to the students. He said that graduating from this school does not mean that your studies are complete, but only that your studies have begun, because there is no end to learning. Graduating is like getting a key to a bookcase. A key to a bookcase cannot be considered knowledge. Knowledge is still in the bookcase, and you must go and find the case, and research it yourself. Assuming you get the key but do not open the bookcase to study, then learning is learning, and graduation is graduation, and they are absolutely unrelated. This argument, for the average college student, who becomes arrogant and thinks he is the best in the world after obtaining a diploma, is truly a penetrating argument.</p>
<p>My father once taught me Mr. Ma's speaking method. He said that acting and speaking must not be separated, and if they are separated, it cannot be considered a speech. If you can only speak but not act, then no matter how pleasing your speech is, standing stiffly on the stage will certainly not evoke the sympathy of the audience. If you can only act but not speak, then you are just a stage performer, merely eliciting a laugh from the audience. He also said that the most complicated action in a speech is placing the hands. Putting them in front is not good, and putting them in the back is also not good. You must be like the conductor of an orchestra, raising and lowering your hands with varying speed, each in harmony with the musical notes, only then will it be appropriate. But standing and giving a speech makes it difficult to place your hands, and sitting and giving a speech makes it even more difficult to drop your hands. Therefore, a speaker must have true knowledge and natural posture, and the absence of either is unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the late Guangxu period (or in the early Xuantong period), the Shanghai newspapers held a tea party at Zhang's Weiyun Garden, inviting Little Liansheng to perform and Mr. Ma Xiangbo to speak. Those invited at that time also included Mr. Wang Jingfang and the old-fashioned traitor Zheng Xiaoxu, among others. Mr. Ma stepped onto the stage, placed one hand behind him, and pointed to the northeast, saying, "I see a dark cloud far away." This dark cloud referred to the Qing government. At that time, anti-Manchu sentiment was extremely intense, and the Qing government also persecuted party members very severely, but Mr. Ma openly made anti-Manchu remarks, and everyone deeply admired him. Although I cannot remember the rest of Mr. Ma's speech, judging from his words and actions and facial expressions, he could make the audience happy, he could make the audience angry, he could make the audience applaud and shout, or silently shed tears. His persuasive power was like this. Little Liansheng performed a play called "Martyr Pan Dives into the Sea." Little Liansheng disguised himself as a foreign student and gave a passionate speech. The audience applauded. Therefore, at that time, there was a saying that Little Liansheng acted like a speaker, and Ma Xiangbo spoke like an actor.</p>
<p>I have heard many speeches, but none like Mr. Ma Xiangbo's. Some can act but cannot speak, some can speak but cannot act, and some can neither act nor speak. For example, Mr. Yan Youling from Houguan, his knowledge was profound, and his insights were broad, which goes without saying, but listening to his speech made people feel drowsy. Even the old-fashioned traitor Zheng Xiaoxu stuttered, almost making people cover their ears and run away. But listening to Ma Xiangbo's speech made people forget the taste of meat with joy. Mr. Ma's knowledge was broad and profound, and although I could not see the bottom of it, I once heard him say to the students, "You can't even remember twenty or so English words every day." I (Mr. Ma referring to himself) used to have to read one or two hundred new words every day, and I could do it with ease. Although this seems like an exaggeration, it is not impossible for Mr. Ma to be proficient in Latin, so English would be easy to understand. Therefore, Mr. Ma was not only a great educator of his time but also a great speaker of his time, truly unparalleled.</p>
<p>Now, talking about Mr. Ma Xiangbo, I am reminded of my impressions of Mr. Ma's words and demeanor thirty years ago, which are still vivid in my mind, so I write this in a rambling manner.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Written on the First Anniversary of Mr. Liu Zhan'en's Death <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Yi</p>
<p>Time flies; it has been a year since Mr. Liu Zhan'en passed away.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's death by shooting by thugs symbolized the shadow of the destruction of Chinese intellectuals in the "isolated island." Chinese intellectuals will never succumb to violence. There are many examples of this in history, and in the year since Mr. Liu's death, the intellectuals of the "isolated island" have responded to it with ironclad facts.</p>
<p>Naturally, Mr. Liu's death, in terms of his individual self, was also a great loss to the motherland's war of resistance and to the development and promotion of the cultural movement of the "isolated island." The frequent disturbances of public security in the concessions, and the excuses repeatedly put forward by the Japanese in their attempts to control the concessions, the so-called activities of "terrorists," are not difficult to discern from this. We believe that there may be several assassination cases in the concessions that were carried out by our enthusiastic elements, but the killing of these shameless traitors will not all be the result of these elements. It is possible that there was internal strife among the traitors over the distribution of spoils, or "when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked." Another kind of terror, coming from north of the bridge, is aimed at our intellectuals, such as the death of Mr. Liu Zhan'en.</p>
<p>And if we recall who was the originator of the terror case, who was the one who posted the "look, look, look" announcement, and who was the one who sent the arms and poisoned fruit, it is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>We are very concerned about the security of the concessions and support the neutral attitude of the concessions. Therefore, we believe that the concession authorities should thoroughly eradicate the source of the terror cases. Otherwise, carving a sword to find its source will be in vain, and the dangers that threaten the security of the concessions will inevitably increase day by day. The disaster of the smoke and gambling is a case in point of spreading from the areas where roads are built beyond the boundaries into the concessions.</p>
<p>And how should we commemorate Mr. Liu? Empty words are unnecessary. Sincere mourning and lamentation are certainly unavoidable, but these should be placed second. The best commemoration is action, especially now that the final victory is getting closer and closer, and the enemy's ferocity is bound to increase day by day. We should reflect on ourselves and see: in this year, how much work have we done that can comfort Mr. Liu in the afterlife, and that can be worthy of our own country?</p>
<h3 id="e120">"Little Devils" in the Northwest: They Work as Buglers, Messengers, Cooks, and General Laborers <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Kamon from *The China Weekly Review*</p>
<p>More than 20,000 homeless Chinese refugee children, from all parts of China, have joined the Eighth Route Army in the Northwest to fight against Japan. Most of these children are between eleven and sixteen years of age, and therefore too young to wield military weapons, but they work as buglers, messengers, cooks, actors, and general laborers. These children are generally called "little devils." In every camp, they are the happiest. They wear motley abandoned military uniforms, often patched in three styles, and receive the same rations as regular soldiers—one yuan in legal tender per month. One sun-tanned child said that being a "little devil" is much more interesting than being a starving ghost in the fields in the Japanese-occupied areas. He left his hometown at the age of twelve and joined the army led by General Zhu De. Now this child is considered very important by the general public, because he is the only one allowed to stand guard at the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army. Few of these children have received an education, but after joining the Eighth Route Army, they receive literacy education every morning.</p>
<p>They are known for their ability to endure hardship. A fourteen-year-old child followed a team of mounted officers and walked forty-three miles in one day. By nine o'clock in the evening, the camp was set up, and he was still chirping like a squirrel, preparing beds for the officers.</p>
<p>Every evening, these children sit together and sincerely discuss the various issues of military science or political science that they have heard from the teachers during the day.</p>
<p>In every camp, the "little devils" have their own military organization and elect their own officers. They swear to abide by a code of honor similar to that of the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
<p>Hundreds of children, who had joined the Red Army long ago during the civil war, are now officers in the Eighth Route Army. After military training, the "little devils" are the most trustworthy quality in the fighting force. For this reason, commanding officers often choose their own guards from among them.</p>
<p>In addition to the "little devils," there are thousands of Chinese youths in the Eighth Route Army, both male and female, recruited from middle schools and vocational schools throughout the country. Now, they are working in various relief efforts behind the Chinese defense lines. On the battlefield, from the front lines to the rear, hundreds of service stations have been set up. These young people are all members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. The service stations are equipped with medical supplies, books, magazines, factories, pots, utensils, a small amount of rice, and boiling water. Many of the young people working in the service stations admit that they ran away from home in order to do their part for the war. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e121">After Watching "Sweethearts" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Sweethearts" Produced by MGM</p>
<p>When you see the love between Taylor Power and Annabella interfered with by the company authorities, don't you express great indignation? Really, in Hollywood, after an actor dedicates himself to the screen, it is more for the "company" than for "art." When you have not yet become famous, the authorities will desperately create opportunities for you. Your every move, whether you like to eat sardines, wear green clothes, or even a inexplicable romance, is excellent publicity material. However, once you become famous, your contract will include conditions such as "not allowed to marry within a few years." The love between Taylor Power and Annabella is interfered with by the company authorities. If this news is not counter-propaganda, can you say there is any other reason besides "for the company"?</p>
<p>Therefore, I think the writer of "Sweethearts" is quite naive and lovely. He tells us this story: "A playwright on Broadway broke up a pair of lovebirds for a special relationship. His plan was to make a wife believe that her husband was in love with their female secretary. He sent someone to steal the love letters the husband wrote to the wife and put them into the play, making the wife believe that the husband also wrote a similar letter to the female secretary." The so-called "special relationship" is also that there is a conflict of interest with the producer of this couple. However, the playwright also showed his cleverness. This couple is a famous Broadway stage star, and because of the Hollywood movie company's invitation, this plan was devised to prevent them from going to Hollywood. But because of the playwright's cleverness, he also told us that there is a dark struggle between Hollywood and Broadway for hiring famous actors.</p>
<p>"Sweethearts" is the first color film by Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Because it is a color film, the director, Mr. Van Dyke, has exhausted his ability to be gorgeous, rich, elegant, harmonious in costumes, backgrounds, and props. Such as the three-act opera at the beginning, the pastoral beauty of the Dutch folk song in the first act; the vivid and dazzling "Fate of Love" in the second act; the harmonious beauty of "Sweethearts" in the third act, not only this, but in each act, the director is very cautious in the color coordination. Jeanette MacDonald wore a brightly colored shirt in the dressing room, and when she put on makeup in front of the mirror, the color not only showed MacDonald's beauty even more, but also felt very comfortable when watching it. There is also MacDonald's fashion show, which really introduced Hollywood's popular new clothes, but isn't it showing the function of color films?</p>
<p>Have you seen "Marie Antoinette"? Were you moved by Van Dyke's outstanding skills? (It is writing about the life of Marie Antoinette, not writing about the history of the French Revolution) But "Sweethearts" is a comedy. It is the opposite of that kind of profound and moving delicate portrayal. The whole film develops in a light and cheerful melody, all the way to the end. What I especially like is the scene where MacDonald listens to the playwright's new script: when the couple is getting ready to leave, they are disrupted by the appearance of this playwright. This scene uses music to set off MacDonald's psychological state, which is very lovely, especially the knitting together.</p>
<p>Don't you like Roland Young in "Topper," then, Franklin Pangborn, who plays the producer, Phipps Lehman, is also equally lovable.</p>

<p>Chapter Seven: A Pair of Swallows and Orioles Weaving a Brocade of Yue and Wu</p>
<p>What Mr. He said in his letter, what is called "raw goods" and what is called "processed goods"? Originally, agricultural products that have not been processed into anything are called raw goods. People have always thought that China is an agricultural country, a producer of raw materials, and that what it produces is all raw goods. For example, raw silk, although it is a major export of China, and it goes through many procedures from silkworm rearing to silk reeling, with specialized research and scientific inventions. However, when it comes down to it, it still belongs to raw goods. It must be dyed into various colors and woven into various silks before it can be considered processed goods. The difference between an industrial country and an agricultural country is that one produces processed goods and the other produces raw goods. Now, the new China is in the process of gradually transitioning from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Therefore, Mr. He wrote to the two young ladies, starting a silk weaving factory to sell abroad, which is an effort towards processed goods. The two young ladies were also very excited after receiving the letter from their old master. They were originally hesitant about the future of their careers, but now Mr. He's letter seemed to be leading them on a path. When they were at home in Guangdong, they didn't feel anything, drifting along. Almost two years have passed since they returned to China. Although they talked about seeking employment, because they were young ladies of the bourgeoisie, it seemed that they were used to being rich and honored. Now that they have arrived in Anle Town, they see that everyone is busy with their careers, without a day to spare. And the two of them are idle and have nothing to do, seeming to be embarrassed by what the ancients said, "eating their fill all day long, without using their minds." A person, whether male or female, cannot rely on the legacy of their ancestors and a few stinky copper coins to live a life of ease. If that's the case, why did we study abroad? And why did we learn about industry? The two of them were originally lamenting to themselves, and discussing it privately, feeling that being idle and doing nothing would be talked about and ridiculed. Today, upon receiving this letter, they thought that Zhu Airen was a good friend and they must tell him. Moreover, if they were to set up a factory, it would have to be located between the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, perhaps it would be appropriate to find a site here, and especially they must discuss it with Airen and ask him for help. That night, the He sisters talked to Zhu Airen about this. Airen smiled and said, "If you want to set up a hospital, then I can offer you many ideas. But now you want to set up a textile factory, I don't know anything about it, isn't that like asking a blind man for directions? But I have a wish, I hope your future textile factory will be located here. Not Anle Town, but Freedom Village would be best." (80)</p>

<h3 id="e123">Our Country's Overseas Chinese Beauty Star, Miss Huang Ying, Returns Home for the First Time <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>

<p>Injured Her Knee When Boarding a Ship in San Francisco, Now Recuperating at Home in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Miss Huang Ying (Wong Ying), the younger sister of Anna May Wong, played an important female role in the film "Eskimo." Although her reputation and status are not as high as her sister's, she also has a considerable reputation. She recently returned to her ancestral country from the United States by ship with two relatives, to visit her family in Hong Kong, which attracted the attention of movie fans in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On the day she boarded the ship in San Francisco, she accidentally injured her knee. By the time she arrived in Hong Kong, her knee injury had not yet fully recovered, so she had to stay in her cabin all the way, feeling that this trip was unfavorable.</p>
<p>According to her conversation with Western reporters in Hong Kong, when she starred in "Eskimo," she lived in the cold Arctic of North America, Alaska, for a full eight months. During this period, although she fell into ice holes several times, she was not injured. She also encountered a man-eating bear, but she was not harmed in the slightest. But this time, on a very new-fashioned mail ship, before the ship had even moved, she lost her footing while walking on the gangway, slipped down four steps, and her knee was injured as a result. She really considers herself unfortunate. She is now recuperating at home in Hong Kong, so she is not receiving many guests.</p>
<p>She also said that many Chinese film workers in Hollywood have been concerned about the situation of the war of resistance in their ancestral country. Whenever they encounter film footage of the war sent from China, when they are being developed in the darkroom, it is always crowded with these people who care about the war of resistance in their ancestral country. Although this behavior is prohibited by the company authorities, they also hold the enthusiasm of sympathizing with China and "being the first to see it," so they are very forgiving.</p>
<p>Ms. Huang Ying has participated in filming in various film companies in Hollywood for nearly ten years, just like her sister. The state of California in the United States is her birthplace. Her father is now seventy-eight years old, and her ancestral home is Guangdong. This is the first time she has returned to her ancestral country in her life. Unfortunately, her ancestral country is now suffering misfortune, which must be very disappointing in Ms. Huang's heart.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of the Qing Palace</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shou'an Palace Stage <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Chan Weng</p>
<p>Among the theater stages in the abdicated Qing Dynasty palace, the one in the Summer Palace is the most magnificent. The Shou'an Palace stage described in this article is also of considerable scale. This stage was built in the 25th year of Qianlong, during the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, and was specially built for the 70th birthday of the Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>This stage is located behind the Cining Palace on the outer west road of the Forbidden City. It is the former site of the Xian'an Palace. In the 16th year of Qianlong, it was renamed "Shou'an Palace." There is a hall in the palace called "Chunxi," and the stage is behind the hall. The stage has three levels, with three bays on each side, a dressing building with five bays, and two corner buildings on the east and west sides with thirty-two bays. This is a rough description of its architecture.</p>
<p>The stage has three levels, with a caisson in the middle, and three plaques, reading "Qingxiao Shaohu," "Zengcheng Guangyue," and "Kunjiān Hengchun." There are three couplets, saying, "Phoenix radiance presents auspiciousness to the A Pavilion, pearls unite and scenery depicts the symbol of the peaceful steps," "Diagrams and domains iteratively evolve accumulated calculations, rhythms and rules cyclically generate harmony above and below," "The singing of Yu and the chanting of Yun celebrate the gathering of nine comforts, opening the longevity domain, the congratulations are presented and the dances of blessings are joined, weaving the myriad images of the spring terrace." The couplets and plaques are all from the imperial brush of Emperor Gaozong.</p>
<p>The construction cost of this stage, as seen in the records of the Imperial Household Department, roughly stated: "Oil painting, colored painting, papering, transporting slag soil, pulling and transporting materials and other projects, except for vermilion, ramie cloth, fir wood, copper tin, gauze silk, and Korean paper, which are obtained from the relevant departments for application, all the purchase of wood, stone, brick, lime, glazed tile materials, red soil rope hemp, nail iron miscellaneous materials, and the payment of wages to various craftsmen, total about 85,394 taels, 8 mace, 8 fen, and 5 li of silver. Excluding the original labor and the demolition of old wood, stone, bricks, and glazed tiles, which offset 9,837 taels, 3 mace, 5 fen, and 8 li of silver, the net need is 75,557 taels, 5 mace, 2 fen, and 7 li of silver."</p>
<p>It is said that the time of the construction of this stage is now 180 years ago. It is not only a relic of the Qing Palace, but also related to the historical facts of Peking Opera.</p>

<p>Zhou Jianyun is planning to resume business of the Star Company in Hong Kong, intending to set up a main factory in Kowloon, with funds loaned by a certain bank. Directors and actors have already been hired.</p>
<p>Gong Qiuxia's performance in "Song of Tears" is exceptionally successful, and her singing is also very beautiful. It is expected that this film will be released to great acclaim for Ms. Gong. Also, Guohua Company regards "Song of Tears" as an unprecedented masterpiece, and the price for selling the film is extremely high.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin's "Incarnation Girl" three episodes will be completed by the end of April.</p>
<p>Among the records recorded by Pathé after the war, "Spring Breeze Wild Grass" has the largest sales volume.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan is very busy preparing to film "Li San Niang," and filming began on April 5th.</p>
<p>Li Hong and Jin Yan, who co-starred in "Lin Chong," often speak English at the filming location, which is quite noticeable.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng and Fei Mu will join the Hong Kong factory of the Star Company.</p>
<p>Yi Hua has decided to carefully select the role of Wang Baochuan. It is rumored that Hu Die has sent a letter agreeing to star in the role, but she must go to Hong Kong to film it.</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun originally planned to get married after autumn, but suddenly her father passed away, so she had to postpone it. Who is the groom? Definitely not the one reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Wang Xianzai has been appointed as the protagonist of "Golden and Silver World." His new wife, Yuan Zhuru, is heavily pregnant. Wang has been living alone for nearly ten years, so it is no wonder that his first shot was a success.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Ming Dynasty Actually Judges Yuan Dynasty Grievances</p>
<p>I often say that Peking Opera is really too pitiful! If we want to examine it carefully, we can know that many of its scripts are translated from Kunqu Opera, Qinqiang Opera, and Han Opera. When they were translated in the past, they could still retain their original appearance, with not much difference. Except for the differences in music, singing style, and drama lyrics, as for the plot and the sequence of dynasties, there would never be any mistakes. However, when the actors of later years translated the plays, I don't know why, they often messed up the original plot. Sometimes, they even brought out people from hundreds of years later and forced them to hear a folk grievance. Not only is it not appropriate to put Zhang San's hat on Li Si's head, but also this kind of despicable act of plundering the beauty of others, I think Song Dynasty's Ju Xiaosu and Ming Dynasty's Hai Ruxian (named Rui, self-styled Gangfeng Mr.) would not want to do it either. Now there is a very popular Dan (female role) play that has this problem. If we don't correct it, I'm afraid it will get worse and worse. If the film company, because of the strong appeal of this play, also shoots it into a movie like "Mulan Joins the Army" and "King of Chu," and even transports it abroad for screening, then this face will be greatly lost. Because European and American drama artists pay the most attention to investigating the era of the script, and if we Chinese don't even know the dynasty of a play, wouldn't that be a big joke? Therefore, I have specially written out this popular play and pointed out its errors, to discuss with the drama comrades, hoping that everyone will not have any scruples because it is the play that made a certain famous actor famous. You should know that our deep research is all for the improvement of the entire drama, this is the real care for drama art.</p>
<p>"Snow in June," also known as "Lamb Tripe Soup," and also known as "The Golden Lock Record," I have seen a certain famous Dan actor perform this play several times. Its description roughly says "During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (the calendar is mistaken for history), Cai Changzong, the son of Cai Yu Shi, married Dou E, the daughter of Dou Shangshu, as his wife, and used the remaining lock as a fixed gift, so it is called the Remaining Lock Record. It was originally a Kunqu Opera adapted into a Luan Tan (Luan Tan is another name for Peking Opera). In this play, Cai Changzong left home to take the exam, and was pushed into the Huai River by his servant Zhang Lver on the way. The old lady Cai heard the news and mourned painfully. While sick, she wanted to eat lamb tripe soup. Zhang Lver poisoned it in the lamb tripe soup, but Mrs. Cai did not eat it, and Zhang Lver's mother, Zhang Mama, ate it and died of poisoning. Zhang Lver wanted to take Dou E as his wife and tried to defraud her by using the dead body. He dragged Mrs. Cai to the court. Unable to withstand the torture, Dou E pleaded guilty for her aunt and was sentenced to be beheaded. Because of her filial piety, the heavens were moved, so it snowed in June. The circuit judge Hai Rui exonerated her grievances, the Lver brother was executed, Dou E was commended, Cai Changzong was rescued, passed the imperial examination, and returned home to be reunited."</p>
<h3 id="e127">"Yang Guifei" Worried About Being Overweight, Hu Die Vigorously Carries Out Weight Loss Techniques <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Silver Thread</p>
<p>About to Start Filming, Currently Busy Taking Medicine and Injections</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Die, after returning from her tour of Europe, has been increasingly gaining weight, and her slender figure is gradually becoming bloated, which is quite detrimental to her beauty. She often frowns in front of the mirror, considering it a major concern. At that time, for this reason, she sought medical treatment and vigorously sought to lose weight. She once gave up nourishing foods containing meat and stopped eating rice, instead using bread, vegetables, and fruits to fill her stomach. After several months of diligent and unremitting efforts, it was indeed somewhat effective. Later, she suddenly fell ill due to a miscarriage, and stayed in the hospital for a long time, focusing on treatment. She often took a lot of milk and other supplements every day. By the time her illness was cured and she recovered her health, not only was all her previous work wasted, but she also gained more weight. Therefore, she spent a lot of effort, but in the end, she could not help but see it all go to waste. After that, she also practiced exercise diligently as a way to lose weight, and even made it a regular lesson, which was easier to persist in. In addition to opening a tennis court in the open space in front of her residence on Jiaozhou Road, and using it as a pastime with her "husband" Mr. Pan every day in a "husband and wife sing and follow" manner, she also hired a boxing coach, and diligently engaged in "Twelve Tan Legs" practice every morning. Ms. Hu's "arduous efforts", although she has not seen any great effect, in reality she has maintained her original state, and has not seen any more "daily progress" phenomenon, and she also feels deeply gratified. However, after moving to Xiangdao (Hong Kong) after the war and living a very leisurely "public lodging" life for a long time, her beautiful face became increasingly plump, and she gained a lot more weight than before. Xinhua Company invited her to star in the hard-dressed film "Yang Guifei." It was originally scheduled to be filmed in Hong Kong long ago, but Zhang Shankun was too busy with business to separate himself, so it was delayed. Now it is decided that after passing the 13th birthday of the old man, he must lead the photography team to leave Shanghai and go south. Ms. Hu's performance in this film is originally suitable for both the person and the play, and it is enough to show the beauty of Huan Fei in a more lifelike way. She is careful and overly worried, and recently she has hired a doctor and is busy with injections and taking medicine, seeking to achieve rapid weight loss. In fact, Ms. Hu's style is still so beautiful now. Even if she plays other roles, she only needs to use proper makeup, and the audience will never really feel that she is "too fat" on the screen. Having a love of beauty is a characteristic of ordinary women, and Ms. Hu, who is known for her beauty, is even more so than others, almost treating it as her second life!</p>

<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>The Peking Opera broadcast celebrating the 100th birthday of Mr. Ma Xiangbo was held at the Continental Radio Station the day before yesterday. From 12:00 noon, famous amateurs and famous actors gradually gathered at the radio station. Jiang Yiqiu, Wang Benshan, Sun Lanting, and Qi Jun were still in charge of reporting. In the afternoon, a total of stage performers Zhao Songqiao, Li Xuefang, Qian Lintong, Zhao Junyan, Shen Yanqin, Li Xiuying, etc., led by backstage manager Chen Yuelou and administrator Lu Wenyi, automatically reported to the radio station, which is commendable for their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In the evening, Li Ziyang and I were in charge of receiving guests, so the famous actors from various stages and theaters came one after another. Zhou Xinfang, who rarely participates in broadcasts, also gracefully accompanied Gao Baisui. Many listeners asked him to sing the play "Wen Suchen." Baisui smiled and said, "Hasn't this play been sung for more than two months? Aren't you tired of listening?" Jiang Yiqiu's performance of this play is also very appealing.</p>
<p>One thing that everyone considered a pity was that Huang Guiqiu, the pillar of the Tianchan Stage, refused to participate because the letter he received mistakenly referred to him as a lady. For the sake of rescuing refugees, it seems that he shouldn't be so serious. Moreover, the advertisement in the newspaper referred to him as "Mr."</p>
<p>Only the movie stars Gu Meijun and Lanjun sisters participated. Lanjun gave a congratulatory speech and thanked the audience. Meijun sang a Qingyi excerpt from "Fenhe Bay." Chen Hefeng sang an excerpt from "Eight Hundred and Eighty Years." The famous amateur Wu Jiangfeng and the clown Han Jinkui sang "Hundred Longevity Pictures" together, which can be said to be good praises and blessings. Han Jinkui's "little dog" Xiao Kui sang an excerpt from "Imperial Fruit Garden." This child's performance has improved even more.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic charitable actors and performers broadcast live until more than 3:00 in the morning before dispersing. The results were very good. More than 300 yuan worth of longevity bowls and commemorative badges were bought by listeners who went to the radio station in person.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market only operated for half a day. Therefore, after discussion among the industry, it was decided to close the market for four and a half days, until next Tuesday, the 11th, when the market will open as usual. However, the situation yesterday morning was slightly volatile, generally falling first and then rising. Initially, due to the lingering weakness of the previous day, the fund houses were eager to sell, so the low was once seen at 2,060 yuan. Afterwards, because retail investors took advantage of the low price to rush to buy, it rebounded upwards. As a result, it fell by 1 yuan. The trading volume in half a day was mediocre. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Custom gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to rise slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai Gold Dropped by 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, the price of raw gold per bar (10 taels) was weak because a certain gold shop was eager to sell and buyers were not interested. Around 10:00, the securities firm bought 50 taels from the fund house at a price of 2,066.5 yuan, which was the opening price. After the opening, there were even fewer buyers. Until 11:00, a certain gold shop pressed the price and sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry at 60 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Afterwards, because buyers took advantage of the low price to rush to buy, but a certain gold shop had no positions to sell, so it rose back. The money exchange industry bought 50 taels from the silver shop at 65 yuan. Then, the gold shop bought 50 taels from the money exchange industry at 68 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. Since the afternoon was the Xia Li Qingming (Qingming Festival), and the industry was closed as usual, the transactions made in the afternoon had to be settled overnight. Because today's settlement coincides with the spring holiday, it was decided to close the market. According to the closing price of 2,068 yuan in the morning, it fell by 1 yuan compared to the previous closing. The difference for the whole day was 8 yuan. The selling price of the cash number's own brand was 2,065 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Still at 210 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang still suspended the original price of 210 yuan, Xin Tong Hang was 208 yuan, and the purchase price was 202 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Continued to Rise by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, May 5th. British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny per ounce due to the continued weakness of the British pound, reaching £7 8s 6d, causing the purchase price of Chinese cash at the Sino-British Bank to also rise to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price of custom gold was still 2.39 yuan per li. The price of Shanghai standard bid gold also rose by 4 jiao, totaling 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Foreign Currencies Very Stable <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were very active in settling payments. The supply from foreign banks was smooth, and the market price was as stable as before. The Shanghai gold market opened softly, and gold shops were selling heavily. Retail investors' absorption was weak, and the market was weak. Later, money exchange firms and Hong Kong firms took advantage of the low price to absorb, and gold shops' supply was not smooth. The market prices were stable. As a result, they fell slightly. There were no transactions in the afternoon. In the foreign market, British-American gold pounds were actively bought. Hong Kong ticket money exchange firms were actively selling, and the market was still stable, with only a few kinds rising and falling, and the changes were very narrow. The guild's transactions were still prosperous. Sen Tai sold 1,000 yuan of Hong Kong tickets to Tong Feng Jin, Qin Tai sold 50 pounds of British gold tickets to Yong Feng Jin, and Cheng Tai sold 100 Swiss francs to Tong Feng Jin. Yesterday's market prices: US dollar tickets fell by 3 li, Hong Kong tickets rose by 3 li, and Philippine tickets rose by 1 fen.

<p>Yesterday, the exchange market was slack because the holidays were approaching, so the settlement of accounts by foreign firms was sparse, and foreign firms still had a lot of supply. Therefore, the situation was very peaceful and there were no changes, resulting in neither good nor bad prices. The transaction volume was also quite light. Although the Chinese banks' absorption of the Hong Kong exchange was very strong, the money exchange industry and foreign firms' supply intentions were not weak, so there was no difference.</p>

Foreign firms settled and entered HSBC British exchange at 8 pence 25. HSBC's listing announcement did not move, and the announcement of the silver balance tax also had no rise or fall, still slightly at 4.50%. After that, foreign firms purchased and settled a certain bank's US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, and the reward was still quite stable. As it neared noon, the transactions became even sparser, with only slight buying and selling of Hong Kong exchange. Foreign banks sold Hong Kong exchange to Chinese banks at 55.875 yuan, and the potential trend was slightly hardening. By the time of the noon closing, the banks' selling prices for both British and American exchange were the same as the morning opening.</p>

<p>In the over-the-counter securities market, yesterday's half-day trading, followed by a four-day holiday (resuming business as usual from the 11th), led to some covering of short positions, and the market price was slightly firm. Trading volume was relatively low, and the environment remained unchanged. European issues are still brewing, and there are still many difficulties with the reopening of the exchange. The blockade of Ningbo port has caused anxiety, leading many parties to sell. These positions must withstand a four-day market closure, so there may be changes. Therefore, both long and short positions were settled, stabilizing the market. Yesterday, the market rose at the opening due to retail investors covering short positions. Songmao, Xieda No. 14, and Dafeng and other firms had some selling activity. On the selling side, Renchangfeng, Dalianhe, and other firms offered slightly more. The market was extremely flat. In the afternoon, preparations were made for same-day delivery, and the market closed for half a day. Market prices ultimately closed slightly firmer by one to two jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 300,000 yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>

<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of British-American Tobacco Company stock were traded at a price of 6.625 yuan, slightly firmer than before.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported on the stock market on the 6th, stating that the four-day Spring Festival holiday starting this afternoon should theoretically impact the market. However, activity remained quite high today, and buying sentiment was strong. Tram stocks rose to 40.5 yuan, and public bus stocks continued to rise to 27 yuan. Jardine Matheson's shares in Wheelock Marden and other large companies were also traded. Jardine Matheson shares were strongly sought after throughout the day, with the closing offer reaching 20.02 yuan. Plantation shares, which had been stagnant for weeks, saw more demand today. Previous rumors of a ban on transferring North China paper currency to Shanghai have gradually dissipated. Rubber shares showed slight activity, but prices remained low. According to reliable news from London and New York, raw rubber materials are currently subject to a 50% production limit, and spot prices have tightened sharply. Raw materials can be sold smoothly everywhere. Once the situation in Europe improves, the rubber market will likely rise. Conversely, if the international situation deteriorates slightly, hindering sales, the market will experience drastic changes.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds, market prices on May 5th (Wednesday): The Anglo-German Extended Loan and Anglo-French bonds continued to fall by £2, priced at £68.5. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds also decreased by 5 shillings, priced at £19.5. The remainder were unchanged. Furthermore, regarding the interest coupons for the current term of the British and French loans, the Ministry of Finance's spokesperson had stated that funds had been secured and could be paid on time. However, the payment deadline passed today without payment. Nevertheless, market prices remained stable and have not declined.</p>
<p>Another report: The British and French loan guaranteed by customs duties was issued on August 18, 1908, with a total loan amount of £5 million and an original term of 30 years, to be fully repaid by 1938. Last year, due to the impact of the war, only the interest was paid on October 5th, while the final principal payment of £250,000 was postponed. Regarding the 61st installment of interest due on April 5th this year, the Ministry of Finance had stated that the funds had been transferred to the paying agency and could be paid on schedule. However, according to a telegram received yesterday from London dated the 5th, the market price was the same as the 4th at £60, without any indication of "ex-interest" (historically, market prices after interest payments on April 5th were marked "ex-interest").

<p>London British Far East Companies' Stocks, market prices on May 5th (Wednesday): Bank stocks continued to weaken. Mercantile Bank shares fell by 7 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £8.

<h3 id="e138">Ningbo Cargo Ships Stagnant, Cotton Yarn Transport Line Not Affected, Shenxin Factory Releases 5,400 Bales of Scheduled Yarn <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is showing signs of recovery, but actual demand is weaker than the previous day. Rumors of a self-imposed blockade of the Ningbo River once made people uneasy and caused a decline. Market discussions indicate that Zhejiang Province has long ceased to purchase cotton yarn, so the suspension of that transportation line will not significantly affect the yarn market. Instead, yarn is being transported via the Youtou inland river to Jiangxi and other places for sale. Additionally, although demand from Hong Kong, Yunnan, and Chaozhou is not exceptionally strong, purchases have been particularly active recently. As a result, the market has recovered. However, news that the Shenxin Factory had released a large quantity of approximately 6,000 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn caused sentiment to relax, and the market appeared flat. Merchants will close for four days from tomorrow, the 7th, to the 10th, for what is commonly called Foreign Qingming.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, colleagues gathered at the beginning of the morning, and although Ningbo merchant ships were suspended, Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants had long since stopped using this route for their cargo, so people remained calm as usual, and it can be said that the market was absolutely unaffected. Therefore, the opening price rose by 2.25 yuan, with 20-count Double Horse yarn priced at 387.25 yuan. Fellow merchants were buying, and shortly after, Hong Kong merchants continued to purchase, further supporting the market. The highest price reached 389.5 yuan. Later, news of a potential sale by the Shenxin Factory caused sentiment to slightly ease, and the price retreated by 1.5 yuan. The market was flat in the afternoon, and trading was even more sluggish due to the Spring Festival holiday. Statistics show that a total of 855 bales were purchased by various merchants throughout the day, with prices generally unchanged from the previous day. The Shenxin Factory released 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 385 yuan, making up for the previous sale at 395 yuan, and 390 yuan was the ordinary opening price, totaling 5,200 bales. Additionally, 200 bales of 32-count Double Horse single yarn were released at a price of 532 yuan, for delivery in April and May, with a deposit of 40 yuan per bale. Fellow merchants took the majority, with fewer customer purchases. Today, 1,400 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, 290 pieces to Hong Kong, 45 pieces to Tianjin, and 115 pieces to Yantai. The amounts purchased by each merchant are listed below:</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) 270 Fellow Merchants 480</p>
<p>Yunnan 10 Shantou 55</p>
<p>Total 855</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continued to advance, with rising momentum. The sharp rise in prices on the Qingdao Exchange boosted sentiment and fueled buying. At the same time, business in the guerrilla zones has been active recently, driving up the market. Next month's prices are expected to be even higher due to a large number of short positions. The spot price for 20-count Water Moon yarn is 355 yuan, and the spot price for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 349 yuan, a sharp increase of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e139">US Cotton Subsidies to Be Announced Soon; Some Supplemental Purchases of Foreign Cotton by Shenxin; Domestic Cotton Still Lacking Highlights <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was active due to high securities prices, and fellow merchants slightly increased purchases, with prices rising by 3-4 points. The so-called Polk-Hague Act, passed by the House of Representatives on Monday, was rejected by Congress (this newspaper had anticipated that this act would not be implemented). Congress is now planning a better solution, with the main points being largely similar to subsidies, and it will be announced soon. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1.5 rupees, while Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 points. Converted to legal tender cotton prices, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 0.2 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.4 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 1.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: The previous day's slight increase in yarn prices prompted the Shenxin Factory to release more than 4,000 bales of cotton yarn, so they slightly increased purchases of raw cotton by several thousand bales. Due to the blockade of Zhenhai, the export of Yao cotton has been greatly affected. Yesterday, Rongfeng imported 2,000 bales of Pingguo cotton as a substitute for Yao cotton, with the price delivered to the factory being only 56 yuan, including water and rebates, making it much cheaper than Yao cotton. The delivered-to-factory prices for foreign cotton futures yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Material Category Delivered to Factory (Including Tax)</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian Cotton, Premium 100.45</p>
<p>Same, Medium 100.55</p>

<p>22-count, 42-count American Pengaipu 89.50</p>
<p>Business in domestic cotton remains scarce, with only white, clean cotton being purchased for delivery to factories, but the quantities are still minimal. However, market inventories are also low, so market conditions are unusually stable. High-quality Haitipu cotton with good stems is still selling at high prices and is not loosening. Overall, there are no highlights in the cotton market, and there is unlikely to be any major change. It cannot rise too much, nor can it easily fall, and it is in a state of confusion. Sources from northern Jiangsu are becoming more accessible, with 1,247 bales arriving at the wharf from Tongxian, and 1,840 pieces of Yao cotton being transported from Ningdu yesterday. The current selling prices for spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 77.00-77.60 Yuanxing Dejin 1,100 bales Delivered to warehouse by remittance</p>
<p>Same 77.40 Xiehehao Jin 1,100 bales Same</p>

<h3 id="e140">Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods More Expensive Than Chinese Factory Cloth; Prices of All Goods Expected to Rise After Spring Holiday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>National cloth: Eastern piece goods rose again yesterday, while the price of national white cloth rose negligibly, resulting in a situation where eastern piece goods are more expensive than national cloth. The price difference is widening, attracting purchasing interest from this street and the guerrilla zones of Wuhu and other places. More than 200 pieces of coarse fabric were traded in detail, and fine twill for dyeing purposes was particularly popular, with more than 400 pieces traded. Fellow merchants are also becoming more active, ordering more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from factories for this month. Printing and dyeing factories have huge demand for patterned cloth, sateen, yarn, serge, and flannel blanks. They are willing to accept orders for both near and long-term delivery, but most are still in negotiations due to difficulty in agreeing on prices. Yesterday, the price of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill rose by approximately 0.1 yuan per piece, while the price of coarse cloth remained unchanged. The cost of bleached and dyed cloth has increased too much, and sales were halted yesterday. Prices of all goods are expected to officially increase after the Spring Festival holiday. Demand from Sichuan and Guangdong merchants has decreased because factories are unwilling to accept pre-orders at the original price. Merchants from Taizhou have been unable to purchase goods since the blockade of Haimen, and are now transiting goods via Wenzhou, purchasing 50 pieces of fine and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: The prices of fine cloth and fine twill are rising more and more sharply. Yesterday, the price of fine cloth jumped another 0.3 yuan per piece. This is because demand from Tianjin and Qingdao in the north is strong, with nearly 2,000 pieces of various brands being purchased yesterday. At the same time, sentiment on this street is also becoming increasingly high, and the market is becoming more tense. This mutual push and pull led to more than 1,000 pieces being traded. Fellow merchant firms are placing nearly 2,000 pieces of fine cloth orders with various foreign firms, with Longtou fine cloth accounting for the largest share. The market is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports: 325 pieces shipped to Shantou on the 7th, 200 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Yarn Raincoat Cloth Soars <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Raincoat cloth made by Tui Kai Shui Mi is the best, especially the old brand 4026, because it does not harden. Therefore, its price is also high. Yesterday, the wholesale price was 8.6 yuan per yard. Ordinary British-made non-genuine 4026 is being sold for 8.45 yuan per yard. Because of its high price, those with weak financial resources are using double-sided yarn raincoat cloth, which is not Western goods. Especially large wholesale clothing vendors are relying on this. Its price is only over 1 yuan per yard. Currently, this yarn-faced raincoat cloth is in great shortage, and the market has suddenly soared. Every yard must be sold for 2.25 yuan. If only 1.75 yuan is earned, now they are all being sold for 2.5 yuan. According to a survey by the Bank of China, no shipments of various colors of non-Western raincoat cloth have arrived this spring. Because of this, Chinese people are studying how to imitate it.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Silk and Tea: New Atmosphere in the Silk Market, Both Domestic and Foreign Sales Are Smooth <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market continued to rise. The near-term price rose by 0.03 yuan, and the long-term price rose by 0.025 yuan. The spot price of Japanese silk rose by 0.02 yuan, and Shanghai silk 0.07-0.08 yuan and Guangdong silk rose by 0.03 yuan each. The Lyon market opened, and the spot price in Yokohama rose by 5 yuan, and the long-term price rose by 17 yuan. The overseas atmosphere is also steadily rising.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, there were many responses to the telegram sent the day before. Silk sales to British, French and American merchants continued to progress. The white factory 7-8 grade price opened at 1,600 yuan, and Jardine Matheson and Dachang jointly imported more than 100 dan. French silk with no average B-grade was sold for 1,580 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Renchang and other firms imported 40 dan. Silk from Ji Li was traded by six firms, including Qilin, Racecourse, M蟒蛇, and Fierce Horse, for 60 dan, at a stable price. Yesterday, user silk was also affected by foreign sales, with 20 dan traded. Overall, yesterday's market was characterized by stable prices and strong sales, a new atmosphere after being manipulated by speculators for a long time.</p>
<p>Today is the Foreign Qingming Festival, and there will be a four-day holiday as usual. Business will resume on the 11th, and the silk market is expected to be even stronger after reopening.</p>
<p>20 pieces of tea will be shipped to Qingdao on the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Grain: Business in Local Flour Not Active, Newly Arrived American Flour Being Peddled in the Market <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Factory flour: The current flour market is stagnant. The No. 2 flour factory's price and local merchants all continue to maintain the original price of 4.4 yuan. However, business is not as active as the previous two days. This is because banks are closing for four days for the Tomb Sweeping Festival, and buyers and sellers have not been able to enjoy themselves. Both northern and southern merchants are only making token transactions. Only local retail sales are still not deserted. The total turnover of local merchants is each estimated to be more than 10,000 bags. Market development may have to wait until the reopening of business.</p>
<p>Today, 19,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, 13,500 bags to Yantai, 4,000 bags to Quanzhou, and 1,000 bags to Shantou. There were also 1,000 bags of bran shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>Foreign flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market was also in a stalemate. The price of Australian flour futures was not drawn, and the price of Qizhi flour futures was slightly lower, at approximately 2.4 yuan in US dollars per barrel. The new American flour that recently arrived from foreign firms such as Shunquan and Long were as many as 260,000 bags and have already being peddled on the market. Such as Dengjie, Magic Brand, and Cai Dao Brand, etc. The selling price is 4.12 or 4.30 yuan in cash per bag, and various fees are added separately, but local merchants are not particularly interested. The seller also plans to wait for the reopening of business before selling. Therefore, there are only scattered store sales. The market is also expected to be stagnant for a few days due to the bank closure. There are three days of spring holidays starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market situation has stopped trading because yesterday was the Qingming Festival. Only miscellaneous grain markets were closed. However, today, 310 sentences of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong and 20,000 pieces of soybean cakes were shipped to Xinghua.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Rice Market Hovering <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various merchants' sources and He Xia共到八號, Che Lun Baozi, 苏同帮, and 昆山太平乔帮 arrived with more than 2,500 bags, and 龙虎塘 arrived with 125 bags. Store demand on this street was average, and囤户 rarely asked about it. The old warehouse still had strong holdings due to the small number of arrivals. The market showed extreme stagnation. Except for 高料包子 goods, the prices of 粳价 did not rise or fall, and the prices of the middle section and 河下货 have already fallen by a few 分 to 角 許. In short, this kind of market is unpredictable, forming a hovering situation. The prices of 杜洋尖 and 埠尖 were average, and they also lacked buying and selling activities.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Up 0.1 Yuan <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for refined white sugar was tighter. Taikoo B brand's price drawing on the Shanghai Merchants Association, delivered at the west warehouse, quoted 25.4 yuan; delivered at the warehouse, 25.3 yuan; 24th grade coarse granular white delivered at the Puxi Wharf, 25.35 yuan; more than one hundred bags were traded; transit goods, 17.1 yuan, two bags. Regarding domestic sugar, only the Chaozhou merchants slightly offered full-grade top-quality ice white at 24 yuan, second-grade ice flower white at 21.5 yuan, ordinary Huanggang green at 14.2 yuan; a total of more than one hundred bags were traded. Because there are no deliveries, the markets of 刁糖 are difficult to revive, but a recent report from a customer letter stated that although the production price has slightly loosened, the price is still needed about 14 yuan, so the prices of brand-name goods cannot be sold immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e146">North-South Goods: Jianqu Production Prices Rising <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The production price of red koji from Fuzhou has already risen by 5-6 yuan before and after, and the cost of drawing a bill of exchange is also becoming more expensive. Therefore, the market price here has also risen accordingly. For example, top-grade transparent red koji is being sold for 58-60 yuan, upper-middle grade 45-46 yuan, ordinary grade 38-42 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Hainan Dried Longan Trading Scant <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>There are few deliveries of Hainan dried longan, and the market price is also weak, so merchants are willing to raise the price to more than 60 yuan, but now the rate is only scattered. Although the cost is high, it is difficult to fulfill that wish. It is said that a dozen pieces were traded, and the price was 59.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e148">More Than 400 Barrels of New Galvanized Iron Sheets Secured <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Merchants from Tianjin and tea merchants purchased galvanized iron sheets yesterday. Because the existing inventory is unusually thin, the opening price has a slight upward trend. For example, No. 2 is sold at 245 yuan per barrel (tea merchants have the widest demand), No. 3 is sold at 240 yuan per barrel, No. 4 is 140 yuan, No. 5 is 230 yuan, No. 6 is 210 yuan, No. 7 is 195 yuan, No. 8 is 210 yuan, and Nos. 9 and 10 are 230 yuan. Tianjin merchants are placing orders for all colors, and the printing house alone needs No. 8. However, there is a great lack of overseas goods, so the factory has secured them from overseas. It is found that more than 400 barrels were secured yesterday. The price was initially £23 per ton, but the final price was set at £22.10.</p>

<p>Narrow strip steel sales, nineteen are for the cigarette factories and can factories. At present, the selling prices are excellent, such as 46 yuan per case of 200 pounds of American narrow strip steel (3 inches or less), 48 yuan per 200 pounds for 3 to 5.6 inches, and 50 yuan for 6 to 8 inches (all American goods). This product is extremely scarce, so the market conditions are good.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of spring, lump coal has been as mediocre as ever, and there are ample stockpiles. Local sales have been somewhat inferior due to competition from falling prices of coal briquettes. Daily turnover is about one to two hundred tons. The wholesale price for merchants is as follows: First grade, No. 2 small chunks 36 yuan, delivered to the store, plus delivery charge. For door-to-door delivery, the first grade is 2.2 yuan per dan, and the second grade is 2 yuan.</p>

<p>Since Kailuan bituminous coal's price increase last month, merchants have taken a wait-and-see attitude. Recently, because factories and firms all have needs, the market has stabilized. Merchants at the market traded 500 to 600 tons. The price is at the yard: Kailuan No. 1 lumps 40 yuan per ton, No. 2 lumps 38 yuan. For door-to-door delivery, add 2 yuan to the price, with a large piece selling for 5.25 yuan.</p>

<p>Among the fine materials of Chinese medicine, cinnabar is produced in Changde, Hunan. Its function is to calm the nerves and relieve fright, so its sales are very wide. Before the Shanghai War, the selling price was only 5-6 yuan per catty. After the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, supplies were interrupted, and the selling price rose to 10 yuan per catty. By the end of last year, it continued to rise to 15-16 yuan. Cinnabar is also an important item in military supplies. It is currently forbidden to export from the local area, so shipments are even rarer. Recently, the inventory is also low, so the selling price has also soared, and is now 56 yuan per catty.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Seasonal Vegetables: Wolfberry Shoots <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Huailin</p>
<p>"In the second month, spring bamboo shoots and wolfberry shoots are both excellent dishes. Although wolfberry shoots are slightly bitter, this does not detract from their quality. Wolfberry shoots not only taste good, but also have great benefits. The wolfberry fruit used in medicine is the wolfberry berry, and the root bark of the wolfberry is the root bark, which functions to clear fire and nourish the liver.</p>
<p>The effects of wolfberry are great, and the use of wolfberry shoots is also many. In the south, wolfberry is a vine-like shrub three to four feet long. In the Ningxia area of Gansu, it grows into a large tree, no less than towering pines and cypresses. Therefore, the wolfberry shoots eaten in the north are like the Toona sinensis shoots we eat, and they can only be picked for a few days a year to supplement meals, and you will miss the opportunity in the blink of an eye. The wolfberry in the south is short and the climate is mild, so wolfberry shoots can be picked for about thirty-four days. When picking, you must choose the newly sprouted tender buds, which are plump and strong. Pluck off a shoot that looks like a flower stamen, about half an inch long. After picking thirty or forty of these, and adding two or three inches of tender spring bamboo shoots, you can make a delicious and palatable dish.</p>
<p>Wolfberry shoots are also known as Tianjing grass and have the same effects as wolfberry berries. They can clear and resolve heat toxins in the blood and reduce the occurrence of sores and boils."</p>
<h3 id="e156">Measles, Shortness of Breath, and Nasal Flaring: Causes and Dietary Care <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>The exchange of air is the process of expelling the old and taking in the new, commonly known as breathing. Adults typically breathe 16 to 18 times per minute, while children breathe approximately 30 times per minute. Except in cases of extreme slowness or rapidity, the breathing rate is usually not closely monitored for diagnostic purposes, nor is there generally a need to do so. In general medical practice, unless the case is a severe and dangerous illness, doctors rarely count the breathing rate.</p>
<p>One symptom is often triggered by a cold and coincides with respiratory diseases, thus most easily affecting breathing. If children with measles have a fever that is too high, it often leads to weakening of the heart. Blood cannot fully enter the lungs, carbon dioxide in the blood increases, the respiratory center is abnormally stimulated, and the breathing rate increases, even exceeding 40 times per minute, resulting in shortness of breath. At the same time, the nostrils also flare.</p>
<p>Besides high fever, the main causes of shortness of breath and nasal flaring are tracheitis or pneumonia. Children with measles often cough frequently, and the trachea is already inflamed. In severe cases, this develops into tracheitis or pneumonia. The inflammation increases the amount of phlegm, which either fills the trachea or leaves no space in the alveoli. With the respiratory passages blocked, the amount of air inhaled into the lungs is reduced, and the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, leading to shortness of breath and nasal flaring. Shortness of breath and nasal flaring in children with measles are very dangerous signs. Immediate medical attention and medication are necessary. Neglecting it even briefly can lead to convulsions or suffocation, rendering the condition incurable.</p>
<p>As for diet, it is difficult to consider when the condition is severe and critical because the patient's appetite has already stopped. Since the patient does not want to eat, and such dangerous shortness of breath and nasal flaring cannot be eliminated by diet alone, the relationship between diet and shortness of breath and nasal flaring is rarely discussed. To my knowledge, the stomach and lungs are located close to each other. When the symptoms of shortness of breath and nasal flaring are not yet severe and the appetite has not declined, it is best not to eat too much, to avoid stomach expansion that would compress the lungs and hinder breathing. Observe how, after excessive eating, one often feels a fullness and discomfort in the chest, making breathing difficult. This is the evidence. In the early stages of measles, cold foods are generally contraindicated, but there are exceptions. If the fever is very high and the measles rash does not appear easily, there is often shortness of breath. If the tongue coating is white, the treatment involves using ephedra and gypsum as the main ingredients. If the tongue is smooth and red, the treatment involves using fresh rehmannia and fermented soybeans as the main ingredients. While using medication that includes cooling ingredients, one should also adjust the diet accordingly. If the fever is very high, it is acceptable to use cooling drinks in moderation, such as water chestnut soup, orange juice, and sugar cane juice. However, it is essential to stop at the right amount and avoid excessive consumption. If the fever is high but not extremely intense, cool foods and drinks can be slightly warmed before consumption, which reduces potential harm. Once the measles rash has fully emerged or is starting to fade, but the fever has not yet subsided, and the shortness of breath is due to the high fever, the tongue will definitely be red. Medication should then consist of large doses of sweet and cold yin-nourishing herbs, such as fresh rehmannia, fresh dendrobium, ophiopogon, and reed root. In this case, orange juice and sugar cane juice can be given freely to nourish yin and clear heat, without needing to soothe qi and open the lungs. The shortness of breath will subside on its own. If the high fever persists for a long time and the heart has weakened, the focus of medication should be on strengthening the heart with aconite, black lead pills, and the like. If the patient can eat, they should eat small amounts of bland, light-tasting foods. Phlegm obstructing the throat, add bamboo sap and fresh ginger juice to the medicine and administer it, allowing it to slowly flow down and be discharged through the stool. For excessive phlegm and shortness of breath, juice grapes and administer the warm juice. These methods can also be used for emergency relief when a sudden change occurs in a stable condition.</p>

<p>There are many types of beans, each with different functions. A brief description follows:</p>
<p>Yellow Soybeans: Tonify the center and resolve toxins. Best cooked, as stir-frying can cause bloating. Sprouted and rooted, they make excellent vegetables. Raw, they are not fishy and are very effective for lung itch, boils, and measles rash.</p>
<p>Green Soybeans: Clear the liver and nourish the stomach. When tender, they can be shelled and used as a side dish, which is very palatable. Boiled in salt water and dried, they can be stored for a long time and transported far.</p>
<p>Black Soybeans: Tonify the spleen and kidneys, expel wind-evil, and effectively resolve various toxins. The skin can be used medicinally to stop night sweats. Prepared soybeans (大豆黃卷), made from black soybeans, treat damp bi syndrome and eliminate water retention.</p>
<p>Red Beans: Promote water circulation and reduce swelling, useful for beriberi. The smaller, darker red variety is used medicinally.</p>
<p>Mung Beans: Cooked, they clear the gallbladder, nourish the stomach, relieve summer heat, quench thirst, promote urination, and sober one up. Sprouted and rooted, they make excellent vegetables with a refreshing taste.</p>
<p>Peas: When tender, they can be shelled and used as vegetables, which are very palatable. Sprouted, they do not cause stagnation.</p>
<p>Hyacinth Beans: The white variety is best. Strengthen the spleen and stop diarrhea.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>After a woman becomes pregnant, her diet requires special attention. Foods to eat include: in the first month of pregnancy, when there is a craving for sour soup, noodles are good. In the second month, when there is a craving for sweet foods, meat is good. In the third and fourth months, soft rice, vegetables, and fish soup are good. In the fifth and sixth months, rich foods, harmonizing the five flavors, are good, but avoid overeating. In the seventh and eighth months, regularly eat soy milk and tofu skin to moisten the internal organs and strengthen the bones. In the ninth and tenth months, the diet should be balanced, with occasional sweets to nourish the spleen and stomach. Foods to avoid include: glutinous rice, which causes worms in the child; dog meat, which causes the child to be mute; and rabbit meat, which causes the child to have a cleft lip. Other foods such as donkey meat, sparrow meat, crab, ginger, arrowheads, and scaleless fish should also be avoided. Various types of mushrooms can cause infantile convulsions. After becoming pregnant, do not take medicine indiscriminately, do not drink too much alcohol, do not lift heavy objects or climb to high places, do not overindulge in leisure and sleep, do not wear overly warm clothes, and do not overeat. These are all essential precautions.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Introducing Ephedra Pear: Responding to the Anti-Spitting Campaign <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Fouming</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been unpredictable, leading to a surge in colds. Coughs and colds are everywhere, and the habit of spitting indiscriminately is on the rise. The anti-spitting campaign initiated by informed individuals is certainly essential. However, if those suffering from colds and coughs can be cured early, the anti-spitting campaign will be more effective. Therefore, I would like to introduce the "Ephedra Pear" remedy:</p>
<p>Ingredients: One large pear, 2 fen of ephedra, 2 qian of Sichuan fritillary powder, 2 qian of rock sugar.</p>
<p>Preparation: First, wash the pear, cut off the top, and use a copper spoon or small knife to remove the core. Place the Sichuan fritillary powder and rock sugar inside. Then, replace the pear top and use ephedra sticks to secure it, joining the top and the pear together. Place the pear in a bowl and steam it in a rice steamer. Once steamed, remove the ephedra sticks. The juice and pear can both be eaten freely. The taste is very palatable, and even children will enjoy it.</p>
<p>Effects: Pear moistens the lungs, resolves phlegm, and reduces fire. Ephedra dispels wind, opens the lungs, and calms asthma. Sichuan fritillary powder opens the lungs, stops coughs, and transforms phlegm. White rock sugar moistens the lungs, generates fluids, and transforms phlegm. When combined, their effects are enhanced. It is very effective for colds and coughs without any adverse effects.</p>
<h3 id="e160">What to Know About Diet After Illness <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongquan</p>
<p>Having read "Qing Bian for Prolonging Life," I found several sections on diet and recuperation after illness to be quite practical. I have transcribed them here for patients' reference:</p>
<p>(1) During typhoid and epidemic diseases, when the body is cool and the pulse is slow, vegetable soup is good to help expel lingering pathogens. If the abdomen feels comfortable, then clear rice soup made with aged rice can be given to stimulate the stomach's digestive function. After one or two days, a small amount of millet porridge can be given three to six times per day, but not too much. With proper soup, a recovery of one hundred days should be achieved without relapse due to food or overexertion.</p>
<p>(2) For all types of pain, avoid consuming pork fat, wet noodles, mutton, greasy foods, and fried foods, as they can cause relapse and make treatment difficult.</p>
<p>(3) After a stroke, avoid pork, mutton, goose, chicken, fish, taro, eggs, stagnant qi-inducing foods, and triggering foods.</p>
<p>(4) For consumptive coughs with fever, edema, and panting, eat a bland diet and avoid salty foods.</p>
<p>(5) After sores or dysentery, avoid overeating and consuming raw, cold, sweet, slippery, or blood-nourishing foods.</p>
<p>(6) After childbirth, women must avoid cold and cooling foods, even on the hottest days.</p>

<p>Twelve Porridges: Porridges are moistening and easy to digest, making them suitable for patients and those with weak spleen and stomachs. Typically, they are cooked with white japonica rice. During illness, the crust of the cooked rice is often used for its aromatic and non-stagnating qualities. However, for nourishing deficiencies after illness, glutinous rice is better, except for those with blockage in the middle jiao, as it is suitable for most conditions. It can also clear lingering heat in the lungs that other medications cannot clear. Therefore, after seasonal diseases, it is the best choice. Additionally, barley porridge can widen the middle and direct qi downward, while foxtail millet porridge can regulate and nourish the spleen and stomach, being suitable for most illnesses. To increase its tonifying power, lotus seed powder, gorgon fruit powder, or Chinese yam powder can be added to japonica rice porridge. These can benefit qi, strengthen the middle, secure essence, and stop chronic diarrhea. Alternatively, swallow's nest, sea cucumber, or juices from chicken, duck, beef, or lamb can be added to replenish deficiencies of yin and yang, essence, and blood. It has been said that some porridge sold in street stalls is mixed with a small amount of lime to make it sweet and sticky. However, this can be warming and drying, causing thirst and spitting. It is only suitable for those with cold phlegm-accumulation, abdominal distention, or a narrow abdomen, as it is similar to the "lime porridge" mentioned in books.</p>
<p>Thirteen: Cow's Milk: Cow's milk is rich in fats and proteins, making it an excellent source of nutrition. It is often used to nourish patients.</p>
<p>Fourteen: Bread and Oatmeal: Bread is made from wheat flour and yeast, making it light, easy to digest, and as nutritious as rice. It is a staple food in Europe and America. Recently, many Chinese people with gastrointestinal problems have also used it to satisfy hunger. Oatmeal is made from flattened oat grains with the bran intact and contains gluten. Gluten is a type of protein that makes up about 10% of wheat, so it also has nourishing effects. It is rarely harmful when cooked for patients. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e162">Drinking Water and Taking a Walk After Meals <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiangren</p>
<p>Food is the paramount concern of the people. Nothing in the world is as difficult as getting food. The primary goal of human life is, without a doubt, the issue of eating. However, I have some confusion. After meals, some people drink tea, some smoke, some drink coffee, some eat fruit, and some eat sweets. Is it because they feel that eating is insufficient and needs supplementation? Or do they feel that eating is useless and needs remedy? I believe that the benefits of those five activities do not match the benefits of drinking water and taking a walk. How much less can they compare to supplementation and remedy? Alas, how many people understand physiology and hygiene? They get used to something and don't examine it, and things continue to be this way.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Aconite Stewed Beef <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Shuliu</p>
<p>Aconite has a pungent, sweet, and very hot taste and nature. It warms the meridians, aids yang, dispels cold, and eliminates dampness. Beef has a sweet, warm, and mild taste and nature. It strengthens the spleen, boosts qi, warms the stomach, and regulates the middle jiao. The concentrated broth made from both ingredients has a pungent, sweet, and warming taste and nature, making it very suitable for patients with yang deficiency and cold in the stomach. Those with a history of yang deficiency and stomach cold are not suitable for tonifying plasters or pills during the winter months. Only aconite and beef cooked together can both tonify and invigorate yang, warm the middle jiao, and dispel cold. Trying it for one winter will eliminate cold limbs and cold body in the coming spring, and the appetite will also greatly increase. For this recipe, use 5 qian to 2 liang of aconite and an appropriate amount of beef. The aconite should be yellow and thick, as its taste and nature are milder than black aconite and does not cause blood stasis or promote heat. The beef should be yellow beef, as its tonifying power is greater than that of water buffalo and can also warm the middle and benefit qi.</p>

<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>The effectiveness of turtle plastron glue for yang deficiency has been mentioned above. Now, I will briefly discuss the effectiveness of turtle plastron glue for yin deficiency. "Yin" is a general term for various fluids in the human body, including blood, semen, and secretions from the digestive organs such as gastric juice, intestinal juice, saliva, and mucus. Its function is to moisten the tissues of each section and part, assist digestion, and promote excretion. Therefore, yin fluids should always be abundant and full. Any deficiency will cause changes in the body. Overexertion, lack of moderation in sexual desire, or those who lean towards a life of the mind, with distorted thinking, excessive mental labor, lack of sleep, and various febrile diseases that burn and absorb water in the body, all can deplete body fluids. Symptoms include fatigue, emaciation, dizziness, tinnitus, flushing, irritability, insomnia, poor memory, and mild fever in the afternoon or evening. Turtle plastron glue is made by calcining turtle bone and boiling it in water. It nourishes yin fluids, promotes gastrointestinal secretions, benefits the kidneys, tonifies blood, and clears deficient heat. It can be effective for the above-mentioned symptoms, hemorrhoids, seminal emission, and uterine bleeding in women that result from yin deficiency. Three qian of turtle plastron glue can be used each time, with 2 liang of aged wine. Put it in a bowl and steam it until the glue melts. Add a pinch of white sugar and then pour boiling water over it. (End)</p>
