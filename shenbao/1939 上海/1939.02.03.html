<p>社評</p>
<h3>德元首英首相與美總統之言論</h3>
<p>「莫謂大局不嚴重，危機固存在也」，此美國前任總理胡佛氏，昨在芝加哥外交問題協會演說時所大聲疾呼者也。三數日來，國際頻危之局，似有好轉之象；世界證券市塲驟呈活氣，市價突飛猛進，此爲人心反映之最明顯者；雖然，危機稍稍輕减矣乎？可望消弭吾乎？抑僅爲潛伏期之延長乎？以吾人觀感，寗於胡佛氏作同聲之應；且蒼狗白雲，瞬息幻變，本報近頃雖既屢論世局，而三日來之波折，固有値得賡續論之者焉。</p>
<p>三日來之國際，無何行動，祗有言論，然謂今後國際之重耍行動，將與此言論有密切關係，絕非過言也。主要言論三：一爲三十晚。德國元首希特勒氏在大德意志衆議院之演說；二爲卅一日下午，英國首相張伯倫氏在下議院之演說；三爲同日美國總統羅斯福氏與參議院陸軍委員會各委員之密談。三者不同其形態：希特勒與張伯倫二氏之演說完全公開，而彼所謂密談者，固以不宣布爲原則也。希特勒之演說爲主動而預定之節目，綜述德國之內政外交；抑無論主觀或客觀，皆以宣明德國之外交態度爲此演說之主旨。張伯倫氏之演說雖出之以內閣對議會述政之普通方式，然意義上乃爲計畫的針對希特勒氏之演說，而相呼應。羅斯福氏與彼參院陸軍委員之間，號稱密談，顧乃不崇朝而徧傳寰宇者，豈道德上或機構上有何闕漏，甚至不得保持其秘密；是則政治上與外交上之必要，不得不出之以半遮半掩之策略也。三日之前，咸以爲希特勒氏演說之內容，殆爲劍拔弩張，誰知其態度乃爲按劍動；張伯倫氏復以善意迎之，於是皆大歡喜；而羅斯福氏之表示英法有難，必予力援，允空谷跫音不啻也。</p>
<p>我人聞三氏之說，深感國際紛爭之事因，非惟絕無解决端倪，抑且允見覓取解决之機運猶遠。不僅遠而已，根本上有無解决可能，有無解决希望，實無絲毫可資樂觀之理由。夫危機既緣紛爭之事因而俱來，安望危機乃先紛爭之解决而消釋；瞻望前途，黯澹凄厲，大局固大難也。所可引爲稍慰者，此次希特勒氏之口吻、雖未見鬆動，顧亦未嘗促進危機，而彼悍然不顧一切之衝動，却亦有時而能自抑；此則經此演說而可供月旦之新資料者也。對英秋波，初於紛爭之事因無涉，故亦不足緩和危機；然在張伯倫氏方面，或因此而稍堅其綏靖政策之自信，或將不負此秋波而有所嘗試歟？謂「國際空氣不佳，則即進行談判，以期解决爭議，滿足願望，消除怨恨，亦屬無益之舉」，似是却步不前之態；然提示「各國縱不能解除軍備，至少當有限制軍備之意念；此種時機若果屆臨，則英國全國人民匪特寄以同情心，其對於綏靖歐洲一般局勢一層，且當盡其所能，此則有可斷言」云云；是則大處落墨，意極可取。誠使世界輿情、姑捨當前得失之辨，而多多致力於此；使德義諸國，亦能稍抑其當前之所願望，而是認縮軍之重要；則假以時日，紛爭焦點容有移轉之一日，感情摩擦容有緩和之希望歟？</p>
<p>三氏言論之性質，惟羅斯福氏之密談未可據視爲美國國家之正式表示；蓋發表之者，不由正常之公告，而由曲折之透露；非謂總統如此說，亦非謂各委員如此說，而曰報人如是聞也。故其產生之力量，將較公開演說者爲弱。誠以總統意念之透露，以迄成爲國家確定之國策，其間宜有相當之距離；况事實上美國之政治社會，形形色色，包羅萬象，其間欲出而爲總統阻撓者，不必有何健全之理論，不必有何高明之見解，借題發揮，躍躍欲試者，必有其人焉。雖然，以羅斯福氏所持態度而論，實較希特拉張伯倫二氏之演說，十百倍其價値。本報於五日前論之矣，以爲欲求世界危機之消弭，其「萬一之望，惟有諸强慨然挺身而出、毅然表示民治諸國家，有難同當，」詎知越二日而得之於美國總統之表示；是足以使黷武者有所顧忌，稍事歛跡者也。美國多賢達，固將如何造就强健之輿情，督促國會　一致擁護其總統之態度，形成國家屹然之國策乎？是則人類文明之曙光，世界和平之福音矣。</p>
<h3>日假借名義呼籲和平　華北民衆團體　通電全國痛斥其誣　以和平為誘惑暗自佈置軍事　意在分化抗戰力量聽任宰割　務宜洞燭奸計堅持抗戰到底</h3>
<p>（重慶）日軍以勞師遠征、久戰無功、近乃假冒華民衆團體及在野名流名義、發出通電、呼籲和平、窺其用意、蓋在分化華抗戰力量、華北民衆洞燭其奸、日前特通電全國痛斥其誣、原電如下、各機關各報館並廣播全國同胞均鑒、敵久戰無功、兵力財力日趨窮蹙、外交亦陷孤立、迫不得已、亟思求和、知我政府堅决、奸謀不逞、連日乃假冒各民衆團體或在野名流如吳佩孚名義、通電籲和、措辭較前更爲緩和、而敵方軍事布置、仍着着不懈、可見敵目的在以和平爲誘惑、其欲分化我戰綫、使我分化氣餒之後、聽其任意宰割、詭計毒辣、無逾於此、吾入務宜洞燭敵計、堅持抗戰到底、以求最後勝利、任何艱苦、此志不渝、華北民衆三十三團體仝叩沁、（二日電）</p>

<h3>陳誠報吿　一週戰况</h3>
<p>（重慶）陳誠報吿一週「自一月二十五日至三十一日」戰况如下、</p>
<p>本週戰况、南北各綫愈有利於我、就整個戰局演進而觀、可判敵軍益陷於泥淖、而我軍更進於勝利之轉機、自上年敵卽揚言將麕集醜類、西犯陝邊、南攻北犯、遂其切斷我西北與西南兩方國際路錢之迷夢、實則敵軍部對駐華南北敵酋分別調助大軍四個及六個半師團兵力之要求、絕對無法應命、故多日以來之虛聲恫嚇、徒供笑談之資、茲就全般戰况、分別摘述如左、</p>
<p>廣束方面，沿粵漢·廣九·廣三各路之敵、週來均無何異動、狀甚沉寂、花縣於上週被敵的兩三千之部隊來擊後、週來經我大軍積極反攻、不支潰退、花縣已經我軍正式克復、鄰近之軍田等亦無敵踪、零星小股之敵、經我某師及地方警察分道夾擊、亦已向太平塲方面潰竄、困據廣州之敵、至是遂仍復入我包圍、動彈不得、至　洲島上嘯聚敵軍、雖有二千以上、然多爲台鮮及山東籍僞軍、正規軍極少、敵艦在北海附近洋面者、往來遊戈不定、足證敵實力耗竭之一斑、</p>
<p>山西方面、自前週晋西我軍先後克復吉縣·大寗·鄉寗·隨縣等重要據點後、敵進犯陝北已成泡影、受創之餘乃轉而潛向晋西南三角地帶進犯、不顧前决勞師數月、犧牲恭重之失敗、再度對我鞏衛中條山脈之英雄健兒爲决死之猛攻、冀藉此三角地帶之掃蕩、奠立將來西犯之基礎、有敵三千名左右由解縣附砲七門轟炸機一架、分三路向我中條山陣地進犯、一方幷另遣敵軍二千餘、自晋東昔陽南犯和順、遙爲呼應、經我官兵日來拼命奮戰、結果現解縣之敵在傷亡千餘重大損失之下、已不支敗竄、和順方面我軍在重創敵高橋部隊長以後、雖暫時退出、然敵軍在關帝廟·紫羅·生川三處、被殱千餘、敵未敢再進、我消耗敵軍之目的已達、</p>
<p>湘鄂方面、湘北戰况平靜、駐岳陽一帶敵軍、大部已撤至鄂北、集中黃陂孝戚、似將有所動作、然鄂中京山，鄂北浙河、數日來戰况已使敵軍無論如何終成夢想、京山門盱於上週相繼淪陷、經我軍奮勇反攻、而京山曾一度克復、刻尙與敵鏖戰於縣城西郊一帶、我仍據守堅固陣地、積極進取、觀音岩一役、計斃敵八九百名、浙河當面之敵、大隊長藤田少將及丸田中隊長均被我擊斃、該方面敵軍月來傷亡共達三千名以上、使敵預定進犯陰謀、粉碎無餘、</p>
<p>其他戰况、河南方面、豫北之敵本週曾自博愛修武以二千餘主力南向我陣地進犯、經我軍拚命阻擊、斃敵四百餘名、餘敵仍狼狽回竄、豫南尉氏縣屬敵僞軍共二千餘、圖渡黃河西犯、已悉數就殲、皖南方面前由灣沚向我進犯之敵三千餘、上週經我軍機續痛擊、僅餘殘敵的八百餘竄退、損失三分之二以上、河北方面、我軍在鉅鹿與敵曾發生激戰、斬獲甚衆、綏遠方面、自上週敵圖犯東勝失敗後、現無何變動、惟駐固陽武川一帶之偽自治軍第四師第六師及駐淸羚河之僞軍王勝諶部等僞軍三四千名、日來均先後反正來歸、予該方面敵軍之打擊至重、</p>
<p>總觀本週戰况、敵軍雖揚言對我將如何如何、實則徒見其外强中乾、筋疲力竭之窘狀、然敵之最後企圖、絕未放棄、觀於敵對我晋南三角地帶陣地之蠢動皮潿州島敵僞軍之積極增加、足證敵未來趨向之一斑、且敵最近在南北各盤踞區內、到處勒迫我壯丁入伍、雖緣我民衆抗戰信念之堅强、使敵計不售、而其亟圖補救兵力不够之野心狡謀、方與日而俱熾、則可斷言、我敵劇戰序幕之展開、正如盤馬彎、一觸卽發也、（一日電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福一言九鼎　歐洲戰禍可暫免　美參院孤立派無能為力　胡佛演說挾繫總統政策　英法甚重視德國大憤懣</h3>
<p>（倫敦）歐洲人士以爲羅斯福總統對於軍備現狀之觀點、在此政局緊張中、關係極爲重要、英法人士、均以爲羅斯福總統願帮助歐洲民主國家重整軍備、實爲對於恢復均勢之一大貢獻、此種貢獻、足以阻止獨裁者之進展、且或將救全世界、使免發生戰禍、（二日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間各報、今日皆以前幅登載星期二羅斯福總統對參院軍事委員會而發之言論、並有婁報著論批評之、新聞紀事報稱、美總統所言者、事實而已、美國在世界中所維護之觀念、其得失所在之地、必不在美國之密西西譬河、而在歐洲之萊因河云、每日民聲報稱、羅斯福總統之態度、已使戰禍不致實現云、惟每日捷報則不若是之樂觀、該報警吿讀者、勿於言外求之、謂羅斯福總統固同情於民治國、但其熊度亦不外乎辦事與常識之態度云、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）羅期福總統對民治國所發保證之言論、已使此間具顯著强烈之印象、但並不認羅總統之言、含有他日全能國與英法民治國開戰時、美國將遣大軍至歐洲之意、惟認爲其言論之力量、非歐美民治國精神團結之普通明證所能及、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）今晨德報對於羅斯福總統大肆抨擊、指爲戰事唆使人與赤化擁護人、人民觀察報責羅斯輻總統治爲猶太人之利益而欲置世界於浩刦中、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）各報對於美總統羅斯福與參院軍事委員會商討以軍火供給各民治國家之消息、均表示憤激、所用標題、有「美國邊境在來茵」、及「羅斯福令人難信之挑釁」等字樣、官塲方面對於此項消息、認爲非正式且尙未證實、故置諸不理、德國政界人士則謂、美報所載秘密會議之消息、如確有其事、則羅斯福總統之言論、殊屬極端可異、因其不啻欲擾亂希特勒之和平政策、而阻止歐洲達到眞正和乎之目的、以臻於繁榮也、吾人至此、不禁思及美國必發生困難、致高唱此類尙武之準備、以期粉飾此類不滿人意之事件、某報載稱、「美國此項行動、實爲大戰以來所未有、羅斯福總統已無疑爲威兩遜第二、美國終已脫離其中立政策矣」、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）美國羅斯福總統所稱該國邊界在法國一語、義國各報甚少加以評論、僅謂　羅斯福　現此項新政策」、旣不受美國全國人民之贊許、且已引起柏林方面之「憤慨」云（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院中現顯然組織一種集團、以反對羅斯福總統在參戰以外、援助民治國、此種集團或將發展、而具有如從前阻止美國加入國聯與世界法庭之勢力、惟羅斯福總統在憲法上之地位、統極堅固、因未涉及締結條的問題也、故參院干涉總統外交政策之權、尙屬有限、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐的世界電報評羅斯福總統星期二號參院軍事委員會會商所豫示美國外交政策之新轉變、美國和平與安全最前之屏障、非在大西洋、而在英法兩國、今已顯然矣、英法之所將遭遇者、爲以現金付與吾人、以易增强吾人國防最重要最受威脅的前衛一隅之特殊利益、吾人之作此交易、其幸運實不可思議、以國防而論、交與英法之飛機一架、其價値實十倍於今後六個月內交與美國空軍之飛機許多架云、同時孤立派參議員克拉克與聶氏耍求公布參院軍事委員會調查法國購買飛機之紀錄、聶氏謂渠擬抵制軍事委員會將來之會議、此種會議完全越出民治習慣所應取之步驟、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間人士對於羅斯福總統與參院軍事委員會之會商及其秘密淸形、雖感覺不一、惟皆預料羅總統之言論、可爲五月間修正中立法時將取消軍火子彈飛機運往交戰國禁令之徵兆、據某評論家之觀察、萬一發生戰爭、美國將成世界歷史中軍火接濟最大來源、美國大愛生產力、可以製造飛機·大砲·坦克車·糧食·服裝、其速度無可與之比擬云、昨日國會孤立派因總統對於其此决會議嚴守秘密、曾提出抗議、然其他各方面之反響、則較爲有利、參院臨時議長畢特曼宣稱、「拒絕接濟各民治國從事防禦其本身之準備、不啻援助從事威脅之列强」云、共和黨參議員瓊森所發表之談片、頗可代表孤立派之意見、其言曰、「美國人民應有權獲知美國以飛機售於英法、其意義是否爲美國已走上戰爭之今途徑、以不僅關係參院且與吾國全體人民有關之大事、秘密吿諸參院委員會、是砍使事實受人之曲解及誤會也、關於修正中立法之可能、瓊氏以爲英法將首蒙其利、因美國堅持須以現金及自行運輸爲採購其貨物之基礎辦法、天然有利於擁有最大海軍與商船隊以及最大黃金準備之國家云、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國飛機售予某某國事、頃由參議院提付討論、外交委員會主席畢德曼、對於羅斯福總統所行政策、表示贊助之意云、「某某國正以威脅加諸各民治國、吾人倘不聽任各民治國獲有自衛力量、何異於爲虎作倀」、米蘇里州民主黨參議員克拉克、考洛拉多州民主黨參議員强森則謂、關於飛機售予某某國問題、暨法國航空部代表施密德林參加轟炸機試飛時失事殞命案、參議院陸軍委員會調查結果、應向參院提出報吿、强森又謂、贊助民治國一項政策、足以招致危機、因而本案經過、宜使美國民衆澈底明暸、共和載參議員奈埃、則宜稱、陸軍委員會舉行秘密會議、不令美國民衆獲悉本國政策眞相、殊屬不當、余茲决定拒不出席該委員會、以示抗議、印第安那州民主黨參議員閔敦、米蘇里州民主黨參議員克拉克、亦决定發表演說、因而此事、或將蛻化而爲外交政策之辯論、亦未可必、此外、民主黨黨團領袖即坎脫基州參議員巴克萊、贊助政府見解、並主張陸軍委員會所聆取之說明、確應保守秘密、以免美國機密洩諸外國、其他參議員數人、則謂陸軍委員會昨日開會經過、竟有洩漏情事、致爲報界所知、殊屬不當云、陸軍委員會茲定於本月五日賡續舉行秘密會議、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）關於羅期福總統與參議院陸軍委員會各委員之晤談、各報無不加以稱頌、其中紐的各報與外埠各大報、對於總統允以軍械接濟各民治國之所爲允表歡迎、但一部份報紙則以爲類此之事、總統不應對參議院守秘密、而　向陸軍委員會言之、紐的民聲講談報載稱、國際時局眞象、總統有使國民了然之必要、此層務請總統注意及之、「美國目下應付危機之準備、已遠較一九一四至一七年間爲優、總統向各民治國表示同情、實爲吾人所贊成總統視爲各獨裁國所加諸全世界之威脅、有增無减、各民治國因此必須出以一致行動、此層吾人亦具有同感云、紐的泰晤士報載稱、吾人對於德國元首希特勒、應有戒心、「觀於去年一年種種經過、國社黨外交在表面上之姿態、輒與其內幕背馳、」彼之兼併奧地利與捷克蘇台德區域可爲殷鑒也、至於美國對德國之觀感、在羅斯福總統昨向參議院陸軍委員談話時、未必明白聲稱、美國邊界在法國固矣、但總統深信法國乃係吾人所應關切之友邦、必須恊力維護、一如其爲吾國之屏障者然、此則凡曾聆取總統談話者、必能充分感覺之」云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院今日依然要求羅斯福總統向國人闡明其援助英法重整軍備之政策，共和黨參員的翰遜稱、「目前之問題、即在我人應吾作捲入戰爭之行動、而毫不令國人知之，」民主黨參員克拉克亦稱、美國之疆界綫現已展至萊茵河之地帶、」並謂、除非政府從速宜明其政策、渠將提請參院予以審查、再則、此種帮助法國擴充空軍之行動、勢將妨碍美國空軍計劃之完成、要求參院軍事委員會公佈其紀錄、及與羅斯福總統秘密會議之經過、據謂、美國駐英駐法大使在參院委員會中所稱、今春歐洲即有戰事發生之預言、及英法軍備不充之言論、完全在慫動委員會之聽聞、唯參院民主黨領袖柏萊在衆說紛紜中、起立聲稱、美國前售飛機與一和平之國家、何能將美國捲入漩渦之中、當時的翰遜即稱、「問題即在秘密上面、且萬事不愼於始微、必將肇大禍於來日、故我人對於自己之眞實行動、不能不知之於未然云、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國會人士今日宣稱、關於美國秘密出售軍火與英法一事、參議院中雖有人提出抗議、並擬予以調查、唯人數仍不甚多、一部人士對於羅斯福總統囑參議院軍事委員會嚴守秘密一事、頗多資難、唯彼等多爲與政府發生意見之共和黨及民主黨員、民主黨參議院克拉克要求發表美國出售飛機與法國之詳情、明日參議院軍事委員會將考慮此一建議、據聞該會員十八人之委員會中、有共和黨員五名及至少民主黨議員二名、將贊成克拉克之提案、（一日美聯電）</p>
<p>（芝加哥）美國前總統胡佛、今日在外交恊會演講、對於羅斯福總統之「新外交政策」大肆抨擊、胡佛稱、「對於外國之直接或間接壓迫、均將引起戰爭、强國遭遇此種壓力、必將起而作流血之抗戰、凡思及經濟制裁者、必須思及戰爭、謂日本·德國·意大利·或蘇聯、或此等國家聯合一致、對西半球作軍事攻擊、實係在囈之語耳、」胡佛稱、羅斯福之政策、意爲美國必須决定孰者爲侵略國、羅斯福之政策大有激起報復行動之可能、必須有充分之準備爲其後盾、渠謂共產主義、國社主義、法西斯主義之侵入、爲一國際問題、非軍艦或飛機所可擊退者、胡佛續稱、另一决大戰或將使獨裁制普及全球、美國或將採取此種制度也（二日美聯電）</p>
<p>（芝加哥）前任總統胡佛（共和黨）昨晚在外交問題恊會發表演說反對孤立主義、其言略謂、「美國現在遭遇兩種威脅、一即各全能國之武力侵略、一即全能思想之侵入、意在毀滅民治主義、第一項威脅又可作兩種看法、一即西半球所直接感受之威脅、一即吾人對於歐亞兩洲各民治友邦表示關切、因而間接感受威脅、雖然武力侵略不易行、各全能國倘胃不韙而向吾國進攻、定必遭遇極强固之防禦、　羽而退、至以思想侵入而論、此乃各國內政問題、要知各種思想旣非軍艦飛機所得而毀滅、「吾人亦無意於攻訐各獨裁國或希望自根本撲滅各國思想、蓋爲思想而紛爭、亦將有毀滅之後果其爲禍之烈、或駕中古時代宗敎戰爭而上之、吾人僅欲防止非美洲的思想侵人美洲、其法惟有將共產主義、國社主義、法西斯主義與各該黨黨徒、擯之於美洲之外、俾吾國各種設施、不致爲所侵蝕、胡佛至是又縱論歐洲時局云、「吾人切勿認其不嚴重、要知危機確已存在、特其迫切情形，不如各項演說所揭示者之甚、夫危機旣然迫在眉睫、則消弭之道、亦往往有之」、其結論則　、美國人民茲當毫不遲疑、對於各種不公道與排斥異已之事、表示憤懣情緒、而對於受痛苦之人類、予以援助、「吾人不應墨守孤立主義、而當用和平方式維護和平、並在經濟上與他國合作、以恢復繁榮、特欲糾正不公允之事、或樹立持久的和平、亦非武力威脅、經濟壓力、或戰爭所能濟事、此則吾人本諸理智、本諸歷史、本諸已往經騐、所已眞知灼見者也」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於美飛機售予某某國事各報所載羅斯福總統與參議院陸軍委員會各委員談話情形、頃由某參議員向哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話、予以證實、羅斯福總統曾吿各該委員謂、世界時局儼如「爆發在即之火山」、一旦爆發之後、不論美國推行何種政策、終必感受影響、自宜與各民治國合作、此乃有百利而無一弊之事、英法兩國在民治思想與全能思想之衝突中負担最重、美國尙可置身事外、但英法兩國若果戰敗、則南北美洲各共和國、即成爲民治主義之最後屏障、禍患亦即已在眉睫、即以此際而論、各全能國若再聽其擴展領土、則美洲各共和國定必受其影響、此外、參議院陸軍委員會某委員、亦吿哈瓦斯社訪員云羅斯福總統昨曾表示、除英法兩國而外、「歐洲其他各獨立國」、凡以反抗各獨裁國之侵略爲事者、美國亦願以軍器售予之云（一日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>英倫銀行　金準備將重新作價　改每星期估計一次　紙幣減至三千萬鎊</h3>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開賣方先喊二千零二十四元、進者還價二十一元、雙方直檳持至十時後、買方因聞外滙受華北聯行及洋行扒後、稍報軟化、故而進者心切、首見某錢業進現金號五十兩、及銀樓帮一百兩、價二千零二十四元爲開盤價、繼之冉進金號五十兩、價二十五元、又進銀樓帮五十元、價二十四元、（聞以上所進均代津港兩帮）未幾某銀樓亦代港帮進同業及現金號各五十兩、價則相同、後又進同業五十兩、價二十五元、相同價父見錢兌業進同業及現金號各十兩、後某錢兌業進金號九十兩、價二十七元、時已十一時許、此後供者轉稀、買方雖仍喊二十七元買進、然未見售者供給、故延至午時仍難做開、故午收價爲二十七元、午後二時十分、首見其錢兌業進北帮五十兩、價二十八元、又進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十八元五角、此後外滙因又受洋行扒結、故續趨緊勢、致塲中買風益熾、售者多束手傍觀、故價一躍即衝出三十元關口、某錢兌業再進銀樓帮五十兩、價三十二元、又進銀樓帮五十兩、價三十三元、其時北帮忽來復進、故漲勢更銳、故價又一躍數元、北帮進金號五十兩、便三十七元、此後錢兌業趁高略有吐售、後稍回挫、錢兌業互做二十兩，價三十六元、又互做五十兩、價三十五元、此後證券帮忽興買風、故價重復步高、進銀樓帮五十兩、價三十五元、又進錢兌業二十兩、價三十七元、再進錢兌業五十兩、價亦三十七元、後仍想再進、因難獲對手、致未做開、故晚收仍爲二千零三十七元、較匕日軋漲十五元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零四十五元、收進二千零三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金二次改貴</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十一時因鑒烚赤甚形堅穩、故亦掛大一元、後又至傍晚四時二十五分、因烚赤突逼近四十元關口、故而再掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百零七元，新同行懸二百零五元、收進一百九十九元、</p>
<p>純金空突然回漲</p>
<p>一日倫敦電、英純金每盎司突然回漲一辦士半、計升達七鎊八先令七辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦回漲至一千二百十三元三角、掛牌海關金亦升三釐、計二元三角九分七釐、上海標金價亦隨之回升一元計一千二百零八元六角</p>
<h3>「聯銀」復起吸收　外匯一度猛緊　後以外電拋售　為狀始稍回鬆</h3>
<p>滙市昨以某掮客代華北準備銀行收吸、暨各大洋行等猛烈爭扒、致潛勢頗緊、計英金一度退爲八辦士二九六八七五、美滙亦會軟至十六元一二五、然卒以外電及華銀行等競相湧塞、故結果所緊不烈、中途起伏甚大、成交頗旺、港滙雖銀行吸胃尚健、無如錢兌業供意不淡、致未分軒輊、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠續縮、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金長一辦士半、匯兌英對美大〇六、對法與對滬仍不動、美對英升〇六二五、對法降〇六二五、對滬平平、中央掛牌各匯呆定如故、銀行早開、賣價英匯八辦士三二八一二五、美滙十六元二一八七五、較前收均平、開後華北聯合銀行力進外銀行美匯十六元二一八七五及英金八辦士三一二五、故潛勢步緊、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小半分、此後洋行界扒進荷蘭美行大通匯豐等英金八辦士三二八一二五及美滙十六元一八七五、致過程益軟、將近午時錢兌業忽來售予華義荷蘭美金票爲十六元三七五、及又賣予華美安達港匯五十六元一二五、是以狀况始轉鬆硬、午收銀行賣價英滙八辦士三一二五、美滙則與晨開相同、爲十六元二一八七五、</p>
<p>後市美行及洋行等爭扒外電華銀行英金八辦士三一二五、及美滙十六元一八七五、後英金最軟竟喊過八辨士二九六八七五、美滙最緊呌過十六元一二五、故潛勢益緊、後以外電及華銀行等聯袂爭塞英金八辦士三一二五、及美匯十六元一八七五、加之洋行結款轉稀、致潛勢回鬆、港匯僅荷蘭吸進錢兌業五十六元、爲狀略軟、迨晚收銀行賣價英匯八辦士三一二五、美匯十六元一八七五、結果比前收英縮〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、港滙則無上落、</p>
<p>英美金票需要旺</p>
<p>昨日英純金回漲一辨士半、英美滙兌回升零六二五、外匯洋行結款甚旺、銀行供給未暢、市價逐步高昂、趨勢軟弱、烚赤港帮吸納甚力、殷富買意濃厚、而獲利拋塞者稀，是以籌碼缺乏、市價上騰銳利、收盤堅挺、觀察烚赤前途、尚須高挺也、外幣殷富搜羅甚力、英美金票需要旺盛、荷蘭票亦殷、各幣供給不暢、市價愈昂、公會交易尚盛、鼎元出長泰進香港票七百元、勤泰出寳成進荷蘭票一百個、盈豐出鴻昌進英金票五十鎊、鎰康出寳成進荷蘭票一百個、昨日市價、英金鎊升一角、英金票升八分、美金鎊升一角、美金票升一分四厘、香港票升一厘、法郞票升半厘、新加坡票升一分、荷蘭票升五分、安南票升三分、羅比票升二分、斐律濱升二分、僅坎拿大票義大利票德金票澳金票暹邏票未更、</p>
<p>大條連疲三天</p>
<p>一日倫敦電　投機家賣出多於買進、市面尚平、收盤後仍平、進者照掛牌價、售者須高〇六二五方肯供給、大條銀近遠期續縮〇六二五、紐的銀電、美銀價依舊呆定如故、又印銀休業無市、</p>
<p>貼現跌小五角</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、略見下低、每千元全日仍盤於三十六七元之間、上午最低三十六元二角半、下午三十六元半、比上日跌去半元、</p>
<h3>證券　統甲如期抽籤　債市如撥雲兒日　—行市俱見回漲—</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、人氣激昂、回風繼續有力、兩週來萎靡不振陰黨之氣、頓見開朗、因最近公佈發息後、在逼近甲種抽籤時、並無其他愛化、昨並由基金保管委員會傳出消息、已奉部令第七决甲種抽籤如期舉行、空方造謠、頓覺技窮、本報對此、亦已數度申述、以爲無非向壁虛搆之讕言、但因人心空虛、市價連跌不止、無事實證明、今舉部令、不啻雲開日出、魔影全消、不過市價經過長時期之跌落、除息算已比高價小去十三四元之鉅、更足以引起一般人之投資、亦是事實、允其是一般散戶前經拋出、今再補回者最爲合算、故前送縱無鉅大漲風、在此决跌風告一段落後、至少可以穩定、</p>
<p>昨日經過、開槃戊種、初做卽覺無神、中開某銀行忽來大量收買、由章某經手拉抬、市况頓轉高翔、此外十五號及三十五號等亦均紛紛補購、漲勢愈勁、賣氣較淡、而十號則仍有乘高賣出、同康號亦稍有出脫、但供求頗覺懸殊、午後情形仍甚堅挺、某銀行續有胃量、散戶亦多數引起興趣、氣象似已甚佳、再好三角、結果一致續漲、計六角半至一元五角半不等、其中丁種、因前日未做開、故漲數較多、成交總的計近百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易又見沉寂、市上大都賣戶稀少、買者不易覓得對手、故多數尚在徵求中也、</p>
<p>昨日股票成交、中華書局股數十股十字誤刋千字、今特更正、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本朋一日（星期三）掛牌行市、各債均無變動、趨勢似轉平穩芙倫實貨供給、亦祗鐵路公債、稍有點綴、湖廣鐵路公債非德發有印債票及有印中籤票各二千鎊、售價均爲二十二鎊五先令、照市微抬五先令、津浦鐵路原發公債德發債票及德發中籤債票各一千鎊、又續發公債德發有印債票三千鎊、均售十六鎊半、照市抬半鎊、又馬可尼無綫電債券一千五百鎊、賣出價爲十二鎊半、買進價則爲十二鎊、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月一日（星期三）掛牌行市、滙豐銀行股續趨上升、計開英倫註册股升半鎊、價爲八十四鎊、香港註冊者升一鎊、價爲八十六鎊半、餘亦無變動、</p>
<p>本埠外灘一號英商上海銀公司（Shanghai　Loan　$　Investment　Co.）於本月一日召集董事會議、討論去年份盈餘分派方案、該公司去年盈餘爲國幣二五九、二八二·三四元、除轉去投資跌價準備國幣八萬元、並開除駐華英防軍捐款國幣三百元外、開派股息每股國幣五角五分、共計國幣十三萬七千五百元、賸餘國幣四一、四八二·三四元、滾入下屆、一俟提交本月十七日舉行之本屆股東會通過後、卽可定期開派、該公司每股票面爲規元五兩、目前市價的爲國幣六元二三角之譜、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗囤戶　逢低仍在拖進　日紗則步步下落</h3>
<p>紗市平穩、實需依然淸　、蓋以總結束時期日近、各帮皆無意搜羅購辦、因此實際消化平常、一般囤戶積存心思濃厚、逢低價時仍來吸收、故市塲手貨泰半被其買去、現貨籌碼反覺短絀、實則多數墊款上棧矣、預料明春有飛黃騰達之望、目下當然關閉不放、意態穩如磐石、</p>
<p>本日現紗市塲情形、晨初開盤緊會者照常雲集、惟探聽客帮無大納胃、故相延至十時以外、方才做開、市價開盤加二元、二十支雙馬現貨爲三百九十四元、同行成交僅五包、棧單價爲三百九十元、少頃價高稍有吐出、又復略挫一元外、但囤戶余融界仍來吃進、不過額子不若以前之鉅、收盤回高、二十支雙馬價爲三百九十四元半、查上午成交統計六百八十五包、同行成交佔三分之二以上、實銷僅一百四十包、行情二十支雙馬價比上日漲二元半、雙地球漲一元半、老金城漲三元、八仙漲八元、飛虎漲二元廠方未有舉動、出口棉紗有三百五十件運汕頭、九十五件運香港、八十五件運廣州灣、二百件運海防、進口有北沙裝來六十五件、茲將各帮買去之額量分誌如左、</p>
<p>日紗市塲愈趨下落、蓋以　實需不旺、且皮球交易無人進出、市象暫告停頓、上月之皮球交易、茲經調停之後、已得相當辦法、决無問題、故市盤步步下降、且跌風允熾、二十支水月現紗價爲三百二十一元至二十元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百十八元至十六元、比上日又跌三四元之譜、</p>
<h3>停止採辦後之　國內外棉市</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、因廠方靜候華盛頓消息之開展、停止採辦已有多日、昨日較有交易、故市價激漲四五磅音、印度昨日停市、預測跌半羅比、挨及昨漲三十磅音、昨日匯兌較疲、折合法幣棉價、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲七角、埃及棉猛</p>
<h3>糧食　粉底缺乏　麥價帶緊</h3>
<p>粉市近日各廠對於原料、準備逐减、洋麥定貨、一再延期、國麥價高且無大量、更兼年關日近、出粉數量不多、現底缺乏、供應頓感不敷、而客帮零星去化、尚不衰弱、市面暗緊、統市售開二號粉二萬餘包、價仍爲四元八角、南北兩帮及本街零批各去三份之一、尚有五號白袋的計一萬包、由北洋帮辦去、價爲天元三角云、出口昨有粉一萬七千七百包運汕頭</p>
<p>麥昨市堅守如故、長江來源依然寥落、貨方均待善價而沽、槪不遷就、廠方以洋麥定貨不日將到、亦無意放價收買、市面不脫擯持狀態、統市成交數比前略增、計開江北及蕪湖麥共三千包、由阜豐廠辦去一千包、福新廠辦去二千包、江北麥最高價仍爲六元五角五分、蕪湖黃皮麥六元二角半至六元、市面帶緊、</p>
<h3>杜米後市雙受挫　客秈價無大上落</h3>
<p>國米來源仍屬寥落、河下貨未有抵埠、而輪車包子亦祇二千餘包、故早市開手、尚有餘彼、售方喊聲頗高、而本街銷塲、亦尚活絡、囤戶則進辦猶小、初市人心頗佳、晚市忽父轉懈、致市面頓挫、結果僅呈定局、厚薄粳無甚進出、杜洋尖埠尖仍守原盤、變元來貨雖有限、但去路不若日前之濃、價亦缺乏軒輊、</p>
<p>客秈市况、因前日略形轉機後、即有浮散小戶隨市求脫、而車輪來源仍見絡繹、市乃復疲、惟大戶行販尚不肯賤價脫手、急於求售之小戶亦不願過份虧本脫手、故在疲軟中略帶擯局、統市成交的一千包左右、行情與前市無大出入、漲二元七角餘、印棉跌一角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、漸入靜寂狀態、昨日毫無交易、實緣年關將屆、紗布銷數稀少故也、茲將昨日價格分列於後、</p>
<p>昨日本埠某大棉行、接得一日紐的總行來電云、關於政府之農業立法、於最近之一二月內、恐難頒佈實行、美棉各國均有小額需要、唯國內銷數激增、上月份消耗額爲六十萬包、</p>
<p>本棉生意、完全入於停頓狀態中、各方面凖備結束過新年矣本年百業、生意旣興隆發達、而財源茂盛、故市塲收束較往年猶早也、市價因需要冷淡、稍帶疲滯、然來源仍阻、存底不厚、蘇北一路到貨轉稀薄、碼頭上到通花七百〇四包、碾跎港來三十件、出口則運香港有一百五十件、運海口有六十件、茲將現棉成交錄左、</p>
<h3>疋頭　國布滇帮進辦較健　東疋買空賣空咸具戒心</h3>
<p>國布客銷大都清淡、惟各廠均已接到　巨額定貨、本月份早無餘額、同業及囤戶手中貨額、亦無意賤賣、惟散戶現貨、售盤稍形康宜、呈外弛內緊之狀、市上各貨、售價平穩、存額單薄之貨、如內衣·恒豐廠八四原布價再加一角、天津恒源廠砲车細斜以滬埠存貨垂盡、獨漲二角、客銷以滇帮較健、成交漂白染色布疋近二百箱、粗布八四原布五十包、甬帮買去怡和·大生·申新·恒源各廠粗布·細斜一百三十餘包、本街購怡和·粗布及華廠九磅粗布近百件、溫州帮亦辦藍布·色斜·粗布等五十件之譜、泉汕帮辦色布·嗶機·漂布·粗布八十餘件、</p>
<p>東布實銷續淡、細布細斜現貨跌風未已、細布因同業手貨鬆售、每疋又降一角細斜比較耍硬着、雖零星小額、亦有斬出、而本街染坯去路尚可、故多頭喊盤依然未動、市塲方面自遭受啟昌號淸理之打擊後、營業减色、遠非昔比、買空賣空者咸具戒心、成交數量極微、昨洋行仍無開貨、惟進胃獨健之本街各染廠辦各牌細布。細斜五六百件、致後市售價又轉堅挺、</p>
<p>今日疋頭出口、計有二百三十件運汕頭、三件運香港、九十件運海門、二百八十件運海防、</p>
<h3>西裝呢羢銷場仍盛　標準行情昨又激漲</h3>
<p>昨呢絨交易、祇西服業進胃仍健、餘少成交、馬尾　花洋布法西襯等、昨成交亦多、至標準行情忽又激漲、蓋目下業內外搜羅收進者、較往年爲衆、而洋行字號存貨奇缺、並因外滙緊縮怡和廠及申織品定價突貴等種種關係故也、是以客銷雖稀、標準行情驟見在漲矣、昨五十五中厚嗶嘰已漲沽八元半、兵船嗶嘰五元八角半、榮康開水美售八元半，五五九元直貢無稅貨已激漲五兀二角半、（按前最低價爲三元八角也、）</p>
<h3>油餅　豆餅買賣　意興闌珊　南洋辦生油一批</h3>
<p>油餅市塲、賣買意興闌珊、市况殊少起伏、豆餅因廠方鑒於豆價頻昂、大都不願賤脫、而銷路因大結束期近、亦見淸淡、故如汕頭帮已形束手、祗厦門尚有問津、然亦僅係趕裝船期而已、昨市則更未聞做開、豆油去路續見减少、市價亦鮮變幻、昨紙成交現大速油三十桶、價開原盤二十八元一角半、訂七天交一百桶、價爲二十八元一角、餘有同業賣買、訂三月上半月裝五十桶、價爲二十八元三角半、花生油到存兩多、市面回挫、昨市聽裝油有南洋帮辦去一批、計做開靑島聽生油五百聽、價二十九元九角、靑口聽生油四百聽、價三十元零二角、烟台聽生油一百五十聽、價亦爲三十元二角、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖交易沉寂</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢、依然疲弱、公會劃盤、至爲淸寂、二四荷粗白外棧現貨、呌二十四元、本棧二十四元二角、大金錢高粗二十四元四角、受手寥寥、太古糖B嘜現貨東棧二十三元五角、駁船交貨二十三元六角，成交亦屬有限、國糖以大結束已近、行方均不急急再進、市價雖無若何變動、但已略呈懈象、高黃崗靑、曾由伺行劃出數十包、十三元八角、潮帮號家呌十三元半、亦未成交、翻赤略有開出、價爲十四元、建帮較高之决白、呌二十一元未成、聞興化大宮粉以產價劃申、須二十四元半、上赤十七元、俱難合算云、</p>
<p>今日有糖六十包運往新港、靑島出口稍爲通融</p>
<h3>南北貨　生仁花生產價俱鬆　靑島出口稍為通融</h3>
<p>靑島通訊、該處新生仁、近日到貨較旺、每日的有二三千包、查統市存底共達五萬包、產價稍鬆、曾以十元四角成交七千餘包、由洋莊及油坊辦去、其他如大粒仁以十一元二角成交一千三百包、</p>
<p>花生存底較薄、共的二萬包、邇來洋莊未動辦、而申帮辦胃亦稀、最近高密生八元二角、開出一千六百包、王台生七元八角、未成交、並問該處花生等出口手續、現在稍爲通融、祇須向組合處呈報、轉請許可、即可付裝、共貨款以前須先滙金、現在可將進口南貨款抵補、較爲便捷、惟外費如前、尚難减輕、</p>
<p>昨有棗子二百二十四包自天津來、粉乾一百五十件自烟台來、又今日有生仁八百包運往香港、</p>
<h3>海味　麒菜供求平衡</h3>
<p>麒菜邇來到貨無間、銷路尚佳、昨開出龍牙菜一批、價爲十八元二角至十八元八角、十九元、市勢平穩、</p>
<h3>新建菇現貨甚缺</h3>
<p>新建茹因來源未旺、現貨甚缺、昨日售開十件、高莊爲二百二十五元八角、普通二百十元〇九角、較前市漲起十元、</p>
<h3>藥材　瓊藿香去路　稍稍開展</h3>
<p>瓊藿香以時令關係、寂靜已久、最低價每担僅售十元左右、刻有北帮客採辦、其勢轉活、昨日成交七八十件、價爲十四元、查號家存貨、不過二百餘件、但入春以後、去路必多、故一般人心思、猶在扳守未肯賤卸、</p>
<h3>大茴香來源暫斷　高喊一百元</h3>
<p>八甬茴香、前以到貨過多、市價由百元跌至八十四元、惟各帮辦胃無間、迄今將近銷罄、故此間底存已不滿百包、而貨主方面、以前後售價、統計似尚難獲利、無意續辦、致來源暫斷、趨勢復緊、刻市又高呌一百元、不日諒有成盤、</p>
<h3>絲茶　中外絲價漲風猛</h3>
<p>昨日國外絲市、日美再度飛騰、紐的八三分日絲漲五分、七五分日絲漲四分、上海B字白廠漲五分、廣東絲漲二分、交易所近遠期各漲四分、橫濱現貨再漲十七元、期貨漲十一元、本埠絲市因之亦愈趨熱烈、用戶一八—二〇白廠昨開一四六〇元、乾繭討價已漲至三六〇元、堪稱登峯造極、洋行絲英法美白廠交易、無法展開、印莊輯里絲續有走銷、絲價漲三〇元、計共成交二〇担、用戶計做開三〇担、出口昨有三十五件運烟台、</p>
<h3>一月份　紐約生絲統計</h3>
<p>上月紐的生絲存銷統計、昨由路透社予以揭露、該統計指出一月份紐的生絲　進口銳减、消費增加、其原因、前者由于日本絲廠將近度年、及日本原料荒之直接影響、後者乃美國機戶在冬季程製春夏綢織品、而增加眞絲需要之故、茲摘錄紐的生絲存銷及進口數字于左、（單位担）</p>
<h3>煤炭　松浦烟煤　存底增厚</h3>
<p>松浦烟煤、近日來現貨突見充溢、日前某洋行又有新貨辦到、託某輸裝來計兩千餘噸、在浦東上棧、與前存底、計共六七千噸之多、因是存貨堆積、推動不易、但貨主亦因成本攸關、不肯輕晚、同行拆價、計開篩塊每噸四十三元、統煤四十一元、煤屑卅七元、暗盤較印度煤爲貴、</p>

<h3>日方非法查扣外輪案　英領將提抗議　前日傳永貞船主訊被扣經過　哈發昨晨到滬海達亦經離靑</h3>
<p>關於、永貞·海達·哈發·等三外輪、被日艦非法查扣一案、滬英總領署對此頗爲重視、曾於前日下午傳永貞輪船主馬萊詢問被扣經過、决向日方提强硬抗議、挪商哈發輪、昨晨十一時半、已由靑到滬、被扣銀鈔、均經發還、海達輪將於明晨續到、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>英領傳詢被扣經過</p>
<p>據航業界消息、英國駐滬總領事署、以英輪永貞號、於上月廿七日在海州附近洋河口擅遭日艦非法查扣、挾持駛靑、雖經交涉釋回、但爲明瞭該輪被扣經過起見、曾於前日下午、傳該輪船主英人馬萊至總領署、由領署法官加以詢問、首詢馬氏永貞輪上有無違禁物品、答稱沒有（問）你知道英日兩國是吾係交戰國、（答）不是（問）旣知非交戰國、則日方當然無權扣留英國商輪、你何以竟聽其命令、駛往靑島、（答）因遭强力脅迫、無法反抗、旋復詢問在靑被扣經過、及營業損害情形、認爲案情已明，卽令馬氏退出、</p>
<p>準備向日强硬抗議</p>
<p>據現代社記者探得可靠方面消息、日方此决查扣英輪、毫無法律、顯係故意排擠英僑利益、雖據日方諉稱係靑島海關當局之事、但查三輪被扣地點、係在海州附近之洋河口、該處原爲江蘇省管轄範圍、若海關方面認爲有查扣必要、亦應駛至上海、由江海關執行檢查、方爲合法、今乃擅令駛往山東省之靑島、足見其藉詞搪塞、殊不能自圓其說、故英總領署、爲確保英僑在華合法權益、决向日方提出强硬抗議、以防止今後再發生同樣不幸事件、</p>

<p>靑島實施　有日之條例相同、此等條例、並無對上述兩地之第三國商人或華商歧視之意云、昨晚據熟悉靑島情况之本埠商人云、日方企圖爲「聯準銀行」籌集外滙準備金、實施是項限制後、日方可藉山東之一切輸出、以達其目的、由橫濱正金銀行辦理</p>
<p>匯兌手續　可使該銀行在海外獲得外匯、而照日本國內所定滙率轉付出口商、其滙率即一先令二辦士或美金二角九分合「聯準」一元是、據最近曾赴靑島一行之金融專家稱、此種虛僞之匯兌價値、已使該埠一度興盛之出口貿易</p>

<p>此種條例　擴充至上述兩海口、以穩定「聯準銀行」紙幣之必要、某記者詢以是項條例爲何方頒佈、而由何方厲行之、發言人答、係由北平「財部」發出「訓令」、交海關當局辦理、記者詢、兩地海關乃上海</p>

<p>國醫與食養</p>
<h3>胃病保養法</h3>
<p>— 何時希</p>
<p>胃病除藥物治療以外，應竭力改革其致病之習慣性，所謂改革之道，則保養與食養是矣。</p>
<p>胃病保養之道，可分「人事的」與「飽食的」種。</p>
<p>人事的；（一）毌多怒，母股憂極思，母抑鬱不歡。（二）每餐宜有定時，偶或失時，過飢後不宜過飽。（三）胸腹之間，當使舒展，勿受壓迫。（四）大便須使每日通暢。（五）胸背部分，須保暖勿使受寒。（六）患他病請醫生診斷時，應告知素有胃病，以免服他藥引起此病。</p>
<p>飲食的；（一）飢飽調勻。（二）凡油膩冷，不可夾雜而進，能薄味淡飯最好。（三）不消化之食物，如乾硬及麵食糯米生冷等。須少食。（四）食時宜細細咀嚼。（五）食後勿宜吹風或悶熱。（六）食後宜稍稍疏散，不可卽伏案辦事。（七）食後忌卽睡，或急步，或房事。（八）不宜服金石助陽藥，及攻導大便藥。（九）五味過甚——甜酸苦辣鹹—之食物，非經醫生特許，不宜多食。（十）非經醫生診斷，不可雜藥亂投。</p>
<h3>藥補食補之選擇</h3>
<p>— 徐相任</p>
<p>吾人體氣强壯，吃得下，做得動，靑菜白飯，皆足以養生而有餘，無所用其補也。惟因積勞而致虛，因病久而致虛，因不知愛惜保養而致虛，婦人因產多產難而致虛，則强壯之體，不免變而爲虛弱矣。虛弱之狀，或吃得下而做不動，或做不動幷吃不下，是則所謂虛也。非補之不爲功。大抵能吃者胃氣尚强，祗須食補，不能吃者胃氣已弱，必宜藥補。蓋食補之品，和平有餘，淸靈不足，藥補之品，淸靈有餘，和平不足。恒言藥補不如食補者，藥補見功快而流弊多，食補見效慢而流弊少也。然補藥之主要，在保全吾人之脾胃，氣味皆取共和平，性質皆取其純粹，以輕靈取勝，不比食補之重濁。故有虛不能食，而進補之後，納榖轉旺，體力漸决復元者，皆淸靈補助脾胄之功也。若夫氣味惡劣之藥，最易敗胃，本不在補藥之列。其有陰柔滋膩者，亦與厚味食品無殊。補力雖宏，不利於脾胃則一也。粥飯皆能養人，血肉食品，補力允其偉大。胃能容受消化，其有益固當十倍於藥品·設不能受而强進之，亦何以異於苦劣之藥品哉？故他人用補，有偏信一面者，而愚則惟以脾胃之宜吾爲取舍：胃不宜重濁食品，則補之以藥物，胃不宜苦劣藥品，則補之以食物，先賢所謂胃愛爲補，能消化即能生長者是。誠用補之標準矣。</p>
<h3>痔漏與飲食之關係</h3>
<p>— 林墨園</p>
<p>痔漏二症致病之因，大半爲食物不忌，喜食辛辣煎炒，及酒類等消化旣難，大便乃時常秘結，肛門受極端刺激，靜脈受壓日久，瘀血所積，遂生瘤成痔。益以江南人十九濕重，侵假成漏，灼癢疼痛，膿血淋漓。</p>
<p>夫食物爲人生營養之源，而選擇允不可不愼，無論何種疾苦，其致病之由皆與平常食物有絕對關係。諺云：病從口入，信然。至於患痔漏之人，則對一般辛辣烈性之物，允宣戒絕，則病情雖不必减輕，然亦不至加重。若一味任性，縱食辛辣刺激物不已，則肛門內瘀血益難流通，必致發炎腫脹，病情陡增；日久脫肛出血，甚或毒燄內侵，危險愈甚。世人每以痔與漏爲癬疥小疾，故於飮食一類多忽之，且有明知之而徒以一時口腹之慾，不能自禁者，誠何異自戕其身也。</p>
<h3>果品療病能力</h3>
<p>— 何龍昇</p>
<p>果品可助藥物治病，種類甚多，摘錄幾種如次：</p>
<p>葡萄富於鐵質，所以葡萄乾可以堅齒健胃。葡萄汁可以補血强身。梨，生吃淸心潤肺，煎成蜜梨，可以治熱咳，痰喘，淸喉，降血，是最普通的治咳單方。藕，煮熱吃汁，可治咳嗽及吐血症，藕節是藥物中的通氣要藥。山楂爲消食要藥，西藥中的消食片，就是山楂製的。楊梅浸酒，年代越陳，治痢越有效騐。在這天寒生着火爐的時候，人們的咽喉，每因烘火，發生漲痛，假使每天吃幾片文且，或一隻橘子，幾個橄欖，就可解火止痛。橄欖打汁，可以解河豚毒，或魚骨梗。此外肺子的澗腸淸肺，枇杷的潤肺消痰，都是很有效騐的果品。</p>
<h3>肺病療養物品</h3>
<p>— 朱振聲</p>
<p>肺癆為慢性病症，故治療上不易卽時全愈，患者因以發生無限之恐慌，致病勢增進者，比比是也；其實肺癆能調理得法，安心靜養，可以全愈，更加藥力治之，功自倍蓰矣。</p>
<p>治肺癆之藥，大都爲培元營養之品，蓋肺癆必須培養之品以增加其自身之抵抗力，而後病魔始可驅之體外。故平日食物，亦當採取富於滋養者。近人於肺癆，多注意於食養療法，確有至理，茲將經騐之所得，介紹二物如次：</p>
<p>大蒜能治肺癆，爲世界所公認，法用獨蒜）卽小蒜）若干枚，每日生食一　，如生食不合口味，則煮服一枚，又備大蒜若干，每日煮數顆於鍋，煮時俯首張口，吸入蒸氣，的半小時，（但不耐其味者，時間可略短）。</p>
<p>油浸白菓，亦爲治肺癆病之唯一營養之品，惟此方所用之白菓，非南貨店中所出售者，乃白菓樹上摘下之白菓，（不去外皮）於小暑之前，將摘下之白菓，（連外肉）浸純菜油內，至三年後，方能有效，愈陳愈妙，臨服之時，可將外肉一併嚼爛，用淡鹽湯送下，功能潤肺化痰，殺菌止咳。</p>
<h3>傷寒症之　病情變化及食養序程（四）</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>發熱輕平欲飮食者，可吃「飯滯湯」，即俗名鍋巴湯，飯焦湯，飯皮粥湯者是也，有熱時只吃此湯，不可　入飯米層粒，銅鍋巴以焦枯帶黑者為最佳，取其扶助胃氣，易於消化之意，飯湯之中，究有營養力量，但此物係流動液體，旣能養身，而不致滯於腸胃，傷　症唯一養身之至寶也。</p>
<p>濕溫傷寒可兼吃食米仁茶（即苡米煎湯，只飮其湯）焦大麥茶，暑溫傷寒可兼飮荷葉茶，尚須因症而施，徵求醫生同意。</p>
<p>傷寒病飲牛奶頗有問題，未得醫生負責，切不可飮。</p>
<p>白開水爲傷寒發熱時最佳之飮料，黨常飮頗有益於發熱時之消耗，近時病人頗多詢問能否飮橘子水者，此物頗有多人可飮，但須榨汁熱吃，橋子須肥大甘美者，小者帶酸，亦不宜矣。</p>
<p>發熱爲日旣久，如其熱低倦憊，神志淸澈，頗欲飮食者，可酌議飮薄藕粉湯，（要眞藕粉，始可應用，如用白色藕粉，多係澱粉菱粉山芋粉之類，不宜也），麥片湯（即美國麥糊片先炒焦，再煮成薄湯），食時以「飢」字爲原則，不能求飽。</p>
<p>傷寒第二時期中，（病情見一月十三本報），熱勢狂盛，經醫生之囑，可飮雪水煮茶，西瓜露，竹瀝油之類；口苦膩淡無味時，可咀嚼靑鹽陳皮，鹹橄攬，靑橄欖，黃連頭之類，一日換一種，嚼汁，吐渣，是爲至要。</p>
<h3>肝類食品</h3>
<p>— 孫宗魯</p>
<p>患虛症目疾及夜盲症者，食猪肝，鴨肝，鷄肝，羊肝，往往效如桴鼓，隨食隨愈。蓋因罹夜盲症者，大抵爲營養不良所致，食肝後營養充足，故能克病魔也。近西醫所製之肝膏，或內服，或注射，五花八門，不一而足，即以動物之肝製成，擅治貧血與營養不足。夫猪肝等爲至賤之物，內含鐵質甚富，市肆唾手可得，作爲菜肴而常啖之，味既鮮腴，更可補血益體；雖貧富均可購置，眞天然補品也。凡家庭中有小孩者，家長宜時以猪肝作菜肴，食之稍久，面色紅潤，精神活潑，身體康强，可操左券。</p>
<h3>冬令補食</h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>冬令為一年之末，養身進補，最為需要。進補之法多數求諸藥物，使有病者治病，無病者强身，此外允當以食補濟之。</p>
<p>近代人士皆以牛乳爲統常補品，但在勞損或病後，以及脾胃虛弱，食慾未振者進之，或有便溏胃呆等象，此乃脾胃消化力尚未復常，陡進富於脂肪質之流液，而不能運納所致也。至羊肉一項，味甘性熱，凡年事稍高，氣體衰微者，及入冬畏冷，陽萎腎虧，虛寒反胃者，食之最宜。然於年靑體壯之人，均不適宜。多食易生鼻衂，遺洩，及身發熱瘰，雞蛋爲滋養料最豐富之物，白能補氣，黃能補血。每晨以三四枚放水內稍煮，或用沸水及滾牛奶冲食，均可。童子雞煮汁服之，培元强身，補力偉大。（能用烏骨雞更佳）牛肉煮汁進之，溫補亦良。</p>
<p>民間相傳用蹄胖一只，合龍眼肉的斤許，飯鍋上燉數日使爛，在冬令連食三四次，據云補力殊偉，惟須胃納佳者，始能食之，以其味甜不甚合胃也。考蹄胖性甘鹹，補元益血，經過多時煨燉或燒煮，即化爲黏性狀物，婦人體弱無奶，或乳質淡薄，食之能增加乳分泌，使乳汁濃厚，凡氣血衰弱。元氣不足，而患痰疸等外症，潰不收口者，多食可促使生肌收口。龍眼肉即桂圓肉，性甘平，能養心益脾，治思慮過度，勞傷心脾，健忘怔忡慮煩不寐自汗驚悸等有效。古方有歸脾湯之配台，足徵此兩物合食，確有相當補益也。</p>

<h3>營養新說</h3>
<p>— 章巨膺</p>
<p>人體組織需要食物之成分。曰營養素。大別之有五。日水，曰鹽類曰蛋白質，曰脂肪，曰炭化水物。水雖無營養之成分。然最占重要位置。血液和消化液中含量最多。溶化營養素。盪滌廢料成分。以及調節體溫皆賴焉。鹽類中有石灰質。是構成骨質之主要成分。蛋白質在肉類如豬之肝腎等皆有之。蛋中有蛋白素蛋黃素。在穀類如麥中之穀膠大麥中之大麥膠。豌豆大豆等。均有植物之蛋白質爲活細胞之主要成分。且能分化而產生體溫及氣力。脂肪在肉類及豆類中含量極多。如牛油豬油豆油花生油椰子油等皆是。爲身體主要之燃料。在細胞內消費時能生力。炭水化物爲澱粉糖質之化學名稱。如馬鈴薯五穀之類有澱粉。葡萄甘蔗有糖質。皆人體之主要營養成分。所以資生體溫及力之根源。此外於食物中有三種成分曰維他命。適合於身體之營義。保持人體之康健。一曰維他命A。能榕解在脂肪中。鰲魚肝油牛酷蛋黃中含量最多。菠菜胡蘿萄中含量亦多。幼兒長成。必需此物質。故又名長成維他命。若無此。則營養不良。發育障碍。成軟骨病。二曰維他命B。能溶解在水中。在糙米麥類豆類菠菜胡蘿蔔馬鈴薯及乳汁等中。含量甚多。白米則無之。食物中若缺乏此種物質。則發生脚氣證。患者可以此質治療。故一名抗脚氣維他命，三曰維他命C。能溶解於水中。窩苣橘子中有此成分。對於壞血症豫防治療均有特效。故一名抗壞血症維他命。我人維持生命。保持健康。須有一定量之營養素。謂之保健食料。此所需營養素量。因性別年領職業氣候等而有差異。大槪成人一日中所需要者蛋白質爲最多。炭水化物决之。脂肪最少，小兒長成。專靠人乳。及二歲以上。必須混食。例如米多含澱粉。少含蛋白質。鷄蛋富於蛋白質。缺乏澱粉。無論何種食品。若專吃一種。决不能營養身體。保持健康。食品之成分。配合得宜。使各營養素無太過不足之弊。爲合衛生。大的人體缺乏何種成分。即嗜好何物。反之。則厭惡而不欲食。</p>

<h3>吳秀才果上梁山麽</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>據同盟社訊，吳秀才已經上梁山了；惟據其他電訊消息，則吳秀才還沒有上梁山，故吳秀才之上梁山與不上梁山，到現在爲止，還成舉世心目中的一個謎</p>
<p>吳秀才一生事業，並沒有足以令人五體投地之處，惟他一身傲骨，對於任何方面或任何人，不肯屈伏，這的確是可敬可佩的。他自失敗以來，不願托庇外人勢力之下，不願身處租界之中，情願伏處故都，讀書養志，這種氣概，確是不凡，故在這一點看來，吳秀才是决不會上梁山的。</p>
<p>但是刻下吳秀才身處淪陷區域的故都中，在日人的勢力之下，怎樣經得起他們天天來利誘威脅，哄嚇譌詐，恐怕不容易保守他的貞操，並且日方正在山窮水盡之際，沒有辦法，只得硬做一椿，這也未始不可能的事，故吳秀才或者要上梁山，亦未可知。</p>
<p>惟吳秀才處現在的環境之下，恐怕只有兩條路可走，一條是上梁山，一條是不上梁山，而走茫茫長夜的大道。吳秀才若到了茫茫長夜的大道，吳秀才倒成功一個完人，但吳秀才若果然上了梁山，也並不是一伴希奇古怪，了不得的事，吳秀才一生好處在傲骨，若一上梁山，則吳秀才一生的傲骨，已付流水，不過是一個行屍走肉的傀儡，與黑旋風李逵，沒羽箭張靑等等，同爲梁山派人物而已，與大局何關。</p>
<h3>薦頭店在上海</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>在上海的人，大的可分爲兩類性質，那就是受人僱用和僱用別人；不過，在同樣是受人僱用或僱用別人中，其階級及情形却也有差別。允其是受人僱用者，同時也僱用別人，僱用別人者，一方面也受人僱用，像這種連環性的關係，我想决非是一個單純的解釋所能够明白的。</p>
<p>上海人這僱用與受僱的關係，沒有一天不在相互地進行着，所以在上海便有介紹所和薦頭店一類特殊事業設立。—不過介紹正當職業的介紹所，至今却還沒有發現；雖然，過去曾經有過幾個投機的介紹所，那祗是一種騙局而已。至於那些以介紹娘姨，犬姐，奶媽一類的，就是所謂薦頭店了。薦頭店大抵可分爲蘇州紹興揚州三帮；他們開設的區域多數是在浜北，如北浙江路，克能海路，開封略，海寗路，愛而近路等，老垃圾橋南也有幾家。我們在從前，只要到那幾條馬路上兜一個圈子，就可看見許多掛着「姑蘇王老荐頭」「紹興張老荐頭」，「維揚老荐頭某某」等招牌的荐頭店。而且在那些荐頭店裹，總是坐着許多準備上人家被人僱用的老婆子或婦人。</p>
<p>至於薦頭店的組織是非常簡單的，他們旣不需多數的資本，也不要堂皇的裝飾，只須租得一間沿街的市房，辦一點應用的傢具，掛上一塊薦頭店的牌子便成功了。不過有的也預備一個擱樓，以便那些鄉下初到上海而沒有親戚處可以住宿，一時又找不到人家的借宿的，然而借宿一夜，他們也須收幾個房錢。白天，就在門面上擺上幾條櫈子，好讓那些待僱者坐在那兒等候僱主。</p>
<p>但是做薦頭店的老闆也要有門路，沒有門路是不行的，譬如他們某一帮便熟悉於某一帮的門徑，幾個公館或大戶人家，差不多時常有他們的足跡；並且每一家都有每一家的老主顧，那一家公館，或那一個犬戶人家所出進的娘姨，大姐，奶嬸嬸，一定是某一家薦頭店薦送的。此外，自然也有自己上薦頭店去呌喚的。</p>
<p>當薦頭店把所欲僱用的人送到以後，僱主便得付給送來的人若干車資，不過在三天之內是爲試用期，如在試用期內認爲不合意，則可呌薦頭店裏另外換送一個人來。然而也有的公館是預先通知了薦頭店要僱用怎樣的一個人，那時讓薦頭店去代他們物色的。</p>
<p>我已經在前文說過，上海的荐頭店原有三帮，在這三帮之中，亦各有各的營業門路，譬如：姑蘇帮的僱主，找起傭人來，大都總是向姑蘇帮的荐頭店里去用的，同時，那些蘇籟的待僱者上起荐頭店來，更其不必說，當然要上姑蘇帮的荐頭店了。所以在無形中，他們也就經渭自分，不過也有例外的，因爲有時蘇籍的僱主，偏喜僱用一個紹興娘姨，或者一個本地僱主却要僱用一個蘇州奶媽等。但這情形終究是少數，原因也許是僱用同鄉人可以减少些言語和習慣上的隔膜吧。</p>
<p>一個女人，爲了在故鄉或家中不能生活，便不得不到上海來找點事情做，然而爲了沒有智識和專長的技能，唯一的出路就只有帮人家；這，如果在上海有熟人的話，那自可託熟人設法介紹，沒有熟人的，祇好上荐頭店去；但荐頭店中也有諸親好友無保不荐的規則，所以要介紹必須先要有個保</p>
<p>荐頭店把一個傭人介紹妥當了，議定了工資之後，他們就有一個規定，被莽的人每月所得的工資中，便須提十分之二或三四作爲荐頭店的酬勞佣金，期限以三個月六個月不等</p>
<p>過去四五年前，荐頭店是曾經盛極一時的，然而如今一般待僱者往往由親友輾轉介紹，而僱主們却都直接僱用，因此，荐頭店的命運亦已一蹶不振，不堪回首了。</p>
<h3>百斛明珠</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Rich　Man，Poor　Girl”</p>
<p>米高美出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>每天翻開新聞紙的社會版來，關於婚姻問題的「新聞」，是佔着極大的分比，而這些婚姻糾紛的發生，大都是由於貧富懸殊而造成的。一個「富家公子在偶一的「興緻」之下，熱戀了一個「小家碧玉」而「結婚」了；但在這「歡樂」的塲面背後，已經潛伏着「悲劇」的結果了。一是富有者根本是抱着「玩弄」的態度，仗着金錢的魔力，玩弄一般的女性爲樂事；一是在這不合理的社會中，人們都用着奇異的眼光，對這「姻緣」毫不留情地嫉妬，諷刺，終於釀成了悲劇而後大快。</p>
<p>「百斛珠明」是正如原名“Rich　Man，Poor　Giri”所示，比爾和瓊的結合，就因爲「貧富判若霄壤」而經過了如許波折。用這樣的題材來攝成電影，自然是很好的，不過劇作者並不加强比爾最後的行動來有力的蹬明，使亨利信任這「婚姻」的結合。而由比爾的姐姐莎莉出來鬧一個假訴訟的巴戲，這是削弱了主題的力量的。</p>
<p>這個戲裏，共介紹了八個人物，除比爾和瓊之外，有瓊的父親，母親，妹妹海倫，弟弟佛蘭克，及瓊的堂兄亨利，導演對於這八個人物的性格可以說是刻劃得非常鮮明的，允其是海倫和亨利。亨利是「剛愎頑固，鄙視金錢終日倡言「偉大的中等階級」的理論」的；海倫是「渴望富貴安逸的糜爛生活」的，導演把這二個人物就這樣寫着的：寫亨利對比爾的不滿，如比爾踏進瓊的家庭之後，他就和比爾辯論；亨利尋到了職業，但知道是比爾暗中推薦的，雖然熱鬧的跳舞會，也不辭而別。寫海倫則是這樣的：海倫知道比爾要來之前，就捲髮，敷粉；開門迎接比爾時候的舉止失措，及最後的大哭，導演把這二個人物的性格是寫得這樣有力的。</p>
<p>整個戲雖然都在瓊的家庭裏，但並不枯澀，而且許多戲都活潑，風趣，這也不得不歸功於導演的。如　瓊說明和比爾訂婚，比爾要到來，合家人的收拾餐具，及打扮；　合家談話時，突然闖入海倫的未婚夫；　比爾夜宿瓊家，那破舊的沙發頻頻作響，蚊蠅的打擾，及室外響着音樂等這些塲面，都是很有趣味的。</p>
<p>最後比爾失蹤，導演對於合宅焦盧的氣氛也把握得很强固。</p>
<p>在小片子中間，「百斛明珠」還是張上乘的作品。</p>

<h3>在虹橋路上出入的人羣</h3>
<p>— 思方</p>
<p>修長平坦的虹橋路，在戰前，除了偶而汽車經過，揚起道旁的沙塵，發出喇叭的吼聲以外，是慣常靜靜的躺着的。</p>
<p>可是現在的虹橋路，却變成一條熱鬧的通衢了。鐵絲網的入口，像張着一張巨口，每天，從孤島上吐出許多人到四鄉去，也每天，從四鄉吞入了許多人。被吞入吐出的人羣，大多數是些質樸的鄉民。</p>
<p>他們流着熱汗，喘着氣，挑着菜蔬，柴薪，花卉等東西，到孤島上來販賣，供給孤島人士以新鮮的蔬菜，燃燒的原料，案頭的淸供等等。</p>
<p>販柴販米的鄉民大抵在上午出來，賣掉了下午回去，菜蔬，花卉等東西，却在傍晚時出來，因爲這些東西是要在每天的淸晨銷售的。</p>
<p>在我們享受到那些東西的時侯，我們是不會想到把這些東西挑出來的質樸的鄉民的一把辛酸淚的。</p>
<p>我曾經和一個賣柴的鄉民詢問過。</p>
<p>張通行證，每個月要三塊錢，一担東西，挑過入口的時候，要一角錢的捐錢，無形的成本，每天至少要兩角錢，買飯吃要錢，住夜也得要錢。</p>
<p>「先生！這就是我們的買賣，還得要加上一身氣力和一雙脚勁。</p>
<p>在虹橋路上出入的鄉民，是帶着一顆沈重憂鬱的心的。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>周圍有一方小小的草地，環以鐵練的欄干。常常有人喜歡在鐵練的欄干傍，帶着照相機去照相。今天這個博物館裏出出進進的人，倒也不少。因爲金小姐常到此地來的，她對於每一間屋子陳列着什麼物品，都是很熟，所以她可以引導了，指陳一切。每一件紀念的物品，都有一個簡略的說明書，但是他們也不及細觀。後來引到一處，上面懸着一個鏡框，是張放大的照片。金小姐便向何家兩位小姐說道：『這便是先父的遺容』。她們看時，果然是一位戎裝的軍官。但容貌並不十分威嚴，說穿了以後，金澹雲的面貌，竟有些像她的父親，顯然這位金旅長，是一位儒將風度咧。這時何家小姐連忙肅然起敬，向照片鞠躬致敬。何儷玉道：『我們也得再獻一束花在金老伯遺容之前』。金澹雲道：『謝謝！剛纔兩位姊姊已經獻花在墓上了』。那個博物館是三層樓，雖不過各室裏的略看一看，已經要躭擱好些時候了。走出了博物館，傍邊就是圖書館。金小姐道：『這個圖書館，我可以說一無可觀。我們只到那裏去望一望好咧』。他們便走進圖書館去，雖然那圖書館建築不大，但那個閱覽室很寬廣。裹面有各種各樣的人，在那裏展閱書報，有的是學生，有的是游客，有的是老頭兒，有的是小孩子。那何家兩位小姐，在外國時，也曾到過許多國外的圖書館，覺得非常整潔。也有些是科學圖書館，都是有學問的人，進去閱覽的。像那樣的小圖書館，倒是第一决見到。雖然金小姐說，毫無可觀，但她們動於好奇心，却想進去看看。何家兩位小姐走到了那邊一排，並坐着一個老頭兒，一個小孩子。老頭兒年約五十多歲，頭髮也已經花白了。小孩子的摸有十歲左右，穿了小學校的制服，分明是個小學生。他們好像是在合看一本書，小學生指手畫脚的好像在講給那老頭兒聽。何家兩位小姐，要知道他們在看什麼書，便悄悄地走到了他們背後。只見看的是一本雜誌，封面上是『農業知識』四個字。因爲圖書館裏人多，雖有人注意他們，也不覺得。（二九）</p>

<h3>是非之觀</h3>
<p>— 莫邪</p>
<p>此亦一是非，彼亦一是非，是非本來難於一定。甚至有些人說，是就是非，非就是是，就因爲是於此者，也許非於彼，反之，非於彼者，也許是於此。女子白而頎長是大多數文明國家所認爲美的條件，在非洲，却以黑而肥矮爲美的極致。再要舉例，當然指不勝屈</p>
<p>爲了各是其是，各非其非，不能彼此是非相同的緣故，所以個人與個人之間，便發生了爭執，口角，以至鬥毆，國與國之間，便發生了抗議，絕交，以至交戰。爭一些是非，便惹成了「是非」。</p>
<p>然而是非眞的絕對沒有標準麽？不見得，標準到底是有的。就以美惡而論，愛美而惡惡，就是一致的是，雖然美惡的標準不同。再說，古往今來，由中及外，也正有許多一成不變的眞理，確定了是非的範疇，有如人吃飯，狗吃屎，那樣的牢不可破。所謂一成不變的眞理，則有：仁愛，信義，和平，公正，……等　項。誰也不敢說，不會說，這些德性是壞的，是「非」的，我們人類不應予以發展而予以剷除的。</p>
<p>然而「聰明人」——其實是無恥之徒—却另有歪曲事實，顚倒是非的本領。明明是侵略，却說是親善。明明是殺人放火，奸淫據掠，無所不爲，却說是弔民伐罪，拯人於水火。明明是壟斷與獨霸，却說是維持共同利益，門戶開放。明明呌別人做他們的奴隸，供他們利用，却說做他們的朋友，共享榮華。……總之，他們明明知道何者爲是，何者爲非，却不惜將非作是，將是作非，並且要別人也和他們一般的是非不明，而官從他們的是非。</p>
<p>我想，假如他們一直這樣胡鬧下去，也許竟有一天，成了習慣，他們的良知就此泯滅，就此的確認是爲非，認非爲是起來。因此，我們要吃飯，也許他們要說，飯吃不得，還是吃屎，或者說，屎就是飯，更或者說，他們從來就是吃屎的，此後也將一直吃屎。</p>
<p>最近，據說這班惹起「是非」之徒，正在處處鼓其如餐之舌，顚倒黑白，格外宣傳着他們的邪說，要我們和他們「合作」，以他們的是非爲是非。我想，「是非之心，人皆有之，我們不見得便會上他們的當罷。吾則，「無是非之心，非人也！」附和邪說者，也就成爲不吃飯的人，而成爲吃屎的狗了！</p>
<h3>「急驚風碰着慢郎中。」</h3>
<p>— 野火</p>
<h3>紙馬克</h3>
<p>— 野吟</p>
<p>都市的街道上佈滿了紅的綠的光浪，已經使驟然跌入人山人海的花匠阿二心頭不由得不忐忑跳個不停，何况他身邊還有那末一件貴重的東西。</p>
<p>是的，花匠阿二懷着滿肚的高興，可以說，他從來沒有還樣高興過，便是小時整天睡在媽媽的懷裏，也不見得有這樣地舒適；這簡直是他平生的一件奇蹟：一千馬克，我的天，該抵中國銀錢多少？</p>
<p>他還記得那天晚上的恐怖。那天晚上，他正躺在牀上，矇矓地要睡着了，忽然門外在吆喝着，脚步聲似乎不是一個人的。終於大門給打開了。一會兒他就給小鷄似的從被窩裏拖了出來，用草繩縛着，牽到屋外去。同時被縛着的，已經有好些人。</p>
<p>誰都不能預料能否見到第二天的陽光；但出乎意外地他們被送到荒凉的曠野。</p>
<p>但鞭影在各人腦後見耀着，誰都得低下頭，聽着命令，一耙一耙地機械地動着，讓汗滴流到鼻尖。心頭的血却在激急地奔流着。</p>
<p>終於，那壕溝被掘成了蜿蜒的一條，他們理會這在執着屠刀，親自宰割自己的兄弟。他們給鞭影詛咒暫時屈服着。</p>
<p>在完成的那天，那些赤老的臉上都顯著愉快。他們聽到大家疲乏的呻吟，不覺猙獰地笑了。</p>
<p>接着他們就詭祕地分發一些花花綠綠的紙張，他也被分給了一張。又聽着那個×奸的話：</p>
<p>「××要人做事是從來不肯虧待人的。現在，你們又自由自在了。你們手中拿着的花綠的東西，那是德國的紗票—馬克票，數目多大：一千元，所以，我說××人是不會虧待人的。」</p>
<p>當然他不能完全相信，他臉上露着疑猜。可是那個人又開口了：</p>
<p>「一到上海，你們就可以問那小錢莊上去兌換。兌換，該懂吧；兌換就是換中國錢……</p>
<p>花匠阿二心頭泛出種種幻想。以前他曾設法想到洋人家去做花匠，現在也許他走運了，使用着許多的外國錢。</p>
<p>他這樣地到了上海：都市的街道是那末的熱鬧。他想了好久，再定了定神，才意識到自己還呆在路上。</p>
<p>去換罷，他亟切要些錢用。他把僅有的幾塊錢已做了旅費，而因爲有巨款在身，用的不免大方了一些。</p>
<p>於是，他就去找那兌換的錢莊。</p>
<p>他曾問過人，人們指點了他。他很忐忑地來到一個不十分相像的舖子面前。</p>
<p>仔細地端詳了好幾回，徘徊着走了又回來。終於，他决定了，他走上前去：</p>
<p>「先生！你們這裏是換銀錢的錢莊吧？」</p>
<p>那架眼鏡的先生臉上露出不屑的神氣，僅用鼻子哼了一個唔」字。</p>
<p>阿二不由得心花怒放。他開始摸索。遲鈍的手脚更使人討厭。他淤後摸出了一個紙包。愼重地把這打開了，除去幾層報紙後，他捧上了那張性命似的花綠鈔票。</p>
<p>架眼鏡的先生用兩隻指頭挾着那張花綠紙：</p>
<p>「紙馬克。」</p>
<p>「不錯，是馬克，我竟忘記了這個名字。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「他們說，値一千元。」</p>
<p>「哼！從前是一千馬克，現在可一文不値。」</p>
<p>那架眼鏡的先生將花綠鈔票拋在玻璃櫃檯上，回轉了頭。</p>
<p>花匠阿二茫然地看着那個先生。他眼前突然一黑，四周的景物都倏地變了。</p>
<h3>臺灣外紀</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>此書乃淸初江日昇所作，寫的是鄭成功及其子孫的始末，首列康熙甲申岷源陳祈永的序和「鄭氏世次」。有求無不獲齋原刋本，上海申報館排印本以及文明書局石印筆記小說大觀本。計三十卷。每卷都繫以七字聯，可見是以一卷當作一回的。「筆記小說大觀」所收章回小說，僅此一種。但嚴格說來，此書如果除去七字聯的回員，與普通的文言筆記「竊憤錄」之類就沒有什麽很大的分別了。</p>
<p>因爲這是淸初的作品，或者爲了不願落入文網起見，寫序的人不免有偏袒異族之嫌：「成功以隆武賜姓，逃竄海外，奉閏運故朔三十有七年，仗義守節，庶幾田橫之遺。然以我朝視之，則固勝國游魂，海隅窮魄，律以犯邊梗化，夫復何辭！敬惟我皇上神功聖烈，度越千古，而鄭氏叛則討之，服則撫之；又仰見皇仁浩蕩，格外矜宥，聿成中外一統之治，億萬年丕基定於此矣。」我以爲即使在環境壓迫之下，像上面這樣的話究竟是逾越了容忍的範圍。好像這幾句話並非不得已纔說的，頗有阿諛討好的成分在內。這樣說來，我們即使爲陳祈永　護，也無從說起了。</p>
<p>江日昇是福建人，以福建人來寫福建的事，當然有許多材料是他省人所不知道的。近人余宗信的度「明延平王臺灣海國記」就曾採用本書作爲重要的材料之一。</p>
<p>此書以鄭成功及其子孫爲經，另外還以明末的動亂爲緯。著名的如卷四寫崇禎帝弔死煤山，卷五寫「黃道周南京盡節」之類。</p>
<p>鄭成功的部分僅卷六到卷十二。在這七卷中又只有卷十至十二是比較緊張的。因爲是用文言寫的，想像又不豐富，所以頗少成功之處；描寫得比較出力的甘煇也不能顯示他的個性。但此書比之「七峯遺編」，似乎還要好一點。</p>
<p>江日昇的態度和作序的人一樣。如卷六云：「成功統林習山甘煇等犯同安，」「賊勢浩大。」稱鄭成功爲賊，成功想要恢復失地便算是寇兵犯境。卷十云：「梁化鳳因海寇直入瓜鎭，隨繞道至江南。」卽第三人稱的旁觀者的口氣也仍然稱鄭成功爲海寇，未免是一個遺憾。但作者對於鄭成功尙無過分侮蔑之處，有人還說作者「寓悲觀之微意」，這是稍足安慰的。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>正當他們這樣爭論猜測着的時候，小學校長盧耀津却一聲不響的負着手，在看左首牆壁上掛的中華大地圖。過了一會，他把一手指着地圖，回過頭來，很高興的歡呼說：</p>
<p>『找着了，在這裏，在這裏。』</p>
<p>他這樣一嚷不打緊，大廳上的人不由得都圍攏來看了。蔡和豐把手指在地圖上畫了一畫，得意地道：</p>
<p>『我說是在浦東，可不是嗎？這裏一條鬱彎曲曲的黑綫就是黃浦江，金由衛雖然在下邊，從地圖上的方位看來，却還是在東面，所以浦南也可以說就是浦東。』</p>
<p>楊岳梁却不去理睬他那得意情形，伸手把架在鼻樑上的老花眼鏡往上抬了一抬，忽然喫驚地呌了起來：</p>
<p>『怎麽的？杭州灣，難道×軍又去打杭州了嗎？』</p>
<p>『不對，杭州灣離開杭州還遠。』盧耀津連連搖手說：「他們决不是去打杭州，而是包抄上海的後路，你們看，從金山衛向北去，渡過黃浦江，不就是上海了嗎？』</p>
<p>這話却使大家都暗暗首肯。總之，戰爭對他們還沒有發生直接的威脅，所以他們在閒談中也就帶着不關心的態度。誰都沒有留心到，就在他們圍着地開談論的時候，大廳上開始悄悄的走進一位穿着嗶嘰呢軍裝的靑年軍官，和一位鬚髮花白的老翁來。還是陳鎭長眼快，首先看見了，連忙提醒大家說：</p>
<p>『葉團長和葉老先生來了。』</p>
<p>響應這話的是一陣歡呼，大家爭着上前來獻慇懃，把葉團長和葉老先生包圍得水洩不通。葉老先生對於這些陪客多半是熟識的，一面向他們點着頭，一面逐一的介紹給葉團長認識。</p>
<p>『請坐！請坐！』陳鎭長親自把上首的椅子彿了兩拂，陪客們也恍然覺悟這樣包圍着的木對，連忙讓開一條路來。葉老先生起初還謙讓着，不肯坐上首的椅子，後來禁不起衆人的推挽，只好勉强坐了下來。不過葉團長畢竟還是在下一位坐了。</p>
<p>「怎麽到得這樣早？」圖董楊岳梁滿面堆歡的問，他和葉老先生平素是很談得來的。</p>
<p>葉老先生把手裏時刻不離開的一支水烟袋放在八仙桌上，咳了一聲，指着葉團長說：（三）</p>

<h3>談文明戲與話劇　從葉秋心說起</h3>
<p>— 冰獨</p>
<p>「此恨綿綿無盡期」觀後感</p>
<p>隨着夏佩珍白虹王漢倫之後，葉秋心也跳出了電影圈投入文明戲隊伍中去了。</p>
<p>爲了想實地去比較一下文明戲話劇的短長，就同白子兄去看秋心登台的第一個夜戲，「此恨綿綿無盡期」。</p>
<p>天韻樓的噱頭</p>
<p>如果那也算是新聞的話，「一九三九的模範美人」和一世界聞名的電影明星」的廣告，倒眞是天韵樓電梯上爲葉秋心而特別佈置的，舞台上，捧角的花籃銀屛之類的陳設自然也値得氣象一新，可見天韵樓方面對於葉秋心的重視了。</p>
<p>文明戲不易演</p>
<p>可是，「此恨綿綿無盡期」是一個悲觀，整個戲的演出，葉秋心雖則担任王珊這一主角，但一個驟然離開了導演並且缺乏舞台經騐的電影從業員，第一次跨上文明戲台，和衣食於斯的文明戲演員們配演，就顯得舉止呆滯和言詞的格格不相入了。</p>
<p>劇本並不墮落</p>
<p>應該說，在劇戲運動中，文明戲自有其不可消滅的原因，在這一個戲裏面，我覺得有幾點幾乎出於我們預期之外，第一是應該向「此恨綿綿無盡期」的編劇者致敬，他一樣地有着前進的頭腦，大胆的吶喊，譬如像暴露高貴家庭的醜態，反映拜金主義的罪惡；痛斥封建婚姻的錯誤；諷刺律師警士的無恥；對於趣料的穿揷，如王大嫂之類的人物，尤其是中下階級中隨處找尋得到的典型；二房東的插繪也很現實；我們不能說它是墮落，祗少我們可以說大部分是够革命的，够敎育的。所應該改良的則是一部分過火的動作，蕪冗的台詞和誨淫的對白，假使能够把毒素總除，或者强調其主題，文明戲的觀衆一定照例會保持其較之祗是建築在一部分小資產智識階級基礎上的話劇現衆會更廣大而有力的。</p>
<p>秋心裏多學習</p>
<p>演員中以飾王大嫂，姨太太兩角最為可愛，她們的演技完全以粗線條的姿態演出，是那們逼眞而親切，秋心忘去了這是文明戲台，平面的說不會講話簡直是個啞吧，立體的說：她沒有全身動作，離開了銀幕之後，局部的小動作到了舞台上自然會變成如供飾品。由此，我似爲演文明戲，决不是墮落，祗要有决心去改良。不過，葉秋心在目前，實在應該先得深深地下一番切實學習的工夫呢！</p>
<h3>播音生活</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>自從有了廣播電台之後，的確替游藝界各色人等開闢了一條生路，除了塲子堂會之外，又多了一筆電台的額外收入，甚至也有靠着電台爲生活的。這幾年來，電台多如雨後春笋，家家戶戶，差不多都置着收音機了，可以閉門家裏坐，不費分文，聽到各種九腔十八調的歌唱，隨心所欲，要聽什麽，就聽什麽，只要機器一開，就會發出咿咿啞啞的聲音來，有錢的人，多麽開心。可是播音員的生活却苦不堪言了。局外人以爲播音生活是多麽寫意，四十分鐘，只要嘴巴開開口，法幣就會送上門來。其實此中痛苦，正不足與外人道也；所謂看人挑担不吃力，筆者也是此中人的一份子，如今把播音員的生活寫些出來，報吿愛聽無綫電的聽衆們。</p>
<p>播音員的開始生活，第一，就是招攬廣告，這全靠牌子的響亮與吾和平日的交際手腕靈敏與吾，講到兜廣告，實在是一件最困難的事情，也有給人包去的，也有不喜歡播音的，除非眞正響擋（即牌子響亮者）會有人請敎，否則，上門兜廣告，難乎其難，所謂熱面孔看冷面孔，但是爲生活計，又不得不順受逆來，運氣好，機會巧，或者能够成交，然而十家到有九家不成的，居其多數，一半還靠朋友介紹，情面換來，播得好，接速下去，播得不好，就此壽終正寢。播音有獨家播送和聯合播送二種，大都以聯合播送居多數，至於播音費用，大有分別，從前收入還好，自從戰事發生以來，生意就難做了，播音員也一天多似一天，彼此擠軋，互相跌價，只要摸着奶奶就是娘，結果，兩敗俱傷，悽慘已極，甚至五塊錢一月的代價也好播音了，這不營自相殘殺，也可以稱做害羣之馬，推原其故，播音員沒有團結性而已。播音也有跑街，所謂包節目，不過經過跑街之手，從中分肥，又得不到好處，所以還是自已招攬，却來得實惠。</p>
<p>播音員好容易攢得廣告之後，第二步手續，就是找電台，買鐘點，可叉發生困難了，電台有大小，鐘點有好歹，大電台，好鐘點，電費貴得要哭出來，少了不是生意經，休想給你上話筒，而且擋擋客滿，出了重價，買不到鐘點，奇貨可居，一副猙獰可怕的資本家面孔，令人退避三舍。在商店方面，當然電台越大越好，可是要他出到相當的代價，可又辦不到要面子的播音員，情願忍痛犧牲，甚至非但沒有好處，還要自己挖腰包，所謂死要面子活受罪。可是話又要說轉來了，電台老班是專歡喜捧響擋的，只要你肯去，就是不出電費也是肯的，以爲一家電台，有了響擋，聽衆就多，不過等到電台一硬，那時節憑你是天字第一號的響擋，也要向你收取電費了，九九歸原，播音員多數是替電台做生意，好像房客之與房東。</p>
<p>好容易費了九牛二虎之力，開了一擋，（就是買到一個鐘點，呌做開擋。）當然囉，得人錢財，與人消災，張開嘴巴，喊破喉嚨，好像石路上的呌衣攤，電車上的賣糖果，忠心狄耿，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後巳的宣傳起來，在播音員的意思，以爲衣食父母，不敢疏忽，可是偏偏有不原諒的聽衆，會不惜三分錢的電話費打到電台來責問，說道，報吿太嚕囌，好像有了一隻收音機，就有監視播音員的權威，說起來眞要氣煞人。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（九四）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>票友界未必沒有眞人才，像從前凈行裏的黃潤甫，劉永春，金唀山，這三位全是名震一時的正凈，副凈，不過他們三人所師承的並不相同，所以各人學成後的戲路，也彼此互異。今日一般唱花面的十九全是以上述三人爲法，比較上就是劉永春道一派學的人很爲稀少，一則因正凈最不易唱，二則因永春晚年久居上海，並帶着他兒子小衡常在烟台，哈爾濱這些地方出演，因此故都的人們就漸將劉春（劉春是他的本名）這個名字遺忘啦。黃三本充內務府茶房，那時南府即屬內務府管轄，所以見的名角很多，他天賦甚佳，也就常常票幾齣戲玩玩，後來卒因走票罷役，他就索興拜到慶四（名春圃，與程長庚演進宮，有雙美併之譽）的門下，實行下海。當時有一位專擅奸雄戲的葉忠定，很受觀衆的歡迎。黃三一想自己的嗓鬥不大合乎正凈這一路，實在比不上聲如金石的何桂山，所以他就專向奸雄戲如「宛城「三打」「下河東」「陽平關」這一類戲裏揣摹，後來居然博得個活曹操的綽號。數他晚年的時候，簡直非曹操戲不唱，因此「活曹操黃潤甫」道六個字更弄得婦孺皆知了。其實他演焦贊，孟良，牛臯，張飛等也都很有精彩，尤其是扮演「羣英會」的黃蓋，眞有驚人獨到的地方，當黃蓋被責後，他有一大段流水板，佶屈聳牙，極不易唱，但是黃三唱來，好腔甚多，現在讓我把他那段失傳的老詞寫了出來，恐怕自命爲黃派傳人的郝壽臣，也不見得還保留這段詞兒呢。</p>

<p>— 若美</p>
<p>明星公司第一部古裝電影「孟姜女」將於今天在金城大戲院試映。「孟姜女」原是流傳悠久的民間故事，含有充分的社會意識的，經吳村　演依照他最近成功作「武松與潘金蓮」之見解改編，並積極的尖對現實，是以一掃舊有錯誤與弱點，令人非但同情孟姜女的貞淑。而且目睹萬喜良是個英勇的志士。我們深信中國現下確需要這類電影，自然更需要這電影裏表現志士與淑女</p>
<p>這部電影在劇本上的編製與意識，旣如上述在藝術上興技術上也有崇高不滅的痕跡；論演技，周璇自是異樣可愛，如西廂私會，燈下自忖，長亭送別，古堡刺賊，以及哭城，過關都有極成就的演出，眞中國影壇紅星。此外如明星訓練所新人徐風亦鶯也很稱職，諧角如尤光照韓蘭根段秀岑，皆有令人意想不到的滑稽，可使你在大笑中感到辛辣的味道</p>
<p>在技術部分，首推攝影與收音，此二者原爲明星公司永遠站在中國影壇最高峯者，然在這部戲裏有更進步的貢獻，例如攝影巳表現着重於時間與空聞的努力，我們可覺得這是由於能凖確使用多種不同的鏡頭的效果。至於構圖的美緻，那是餘事。收音亦很好合標準。尤其是「低調」有驚人成功，如孟姜女在狂風暴雨中的喘息，茍非有最優良之機械與最優良人之才是辦不到的。置服景裝也同相當考究，據余城大戲院傳出，舊　元旦，有三部鉅片在角逐他們的映權，現在已選定「孟姜女」了，這裏我們也認爲有理由的，因是敢向讀者推薦。</p>

<h3>The Authorities Are Adjusting Military Affairs in Guangdong: Wu Qiwai's Troops Take Over Defense of Eastern Guangdong; New Developments Expected in the Battle Situation in the Dongjiang Area; Chinese Side Denies Japanese Troops Landed in Beihai</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The authorities are adjusting military affairs in Guangdong. Yu Hanmou's troops in eastern Guangdong are being transferred to northern Guangdong, while Wu Qiwai's troops and elite mechanized units are taking over the defense. A battle situation is expected to develop soon in the Zengcheng area of Dongjiang. (3rd, 2 AM special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to information received, a Chinese military spokesperson in Chongqing told reporters that rumors of Japanese troops landing near Beihai were false. The spokesperson added that Japanese forces in central and northwest China are currently unable to launch large-scale offensives due to continuous counterattacks by Chinese forces and increasingly active guerrilla warfare. (2nd, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese army and navy have agreed that the navy will garrison cities along 700 miles of the Yangtze River, while the army will eliminate Chinese guerrilla forces in the occupied areas. It is also learned that the Japanese are building several military bases. (3rd, 2 AM special dispatch)</p>
<p>Wuzhou: On the 31st, at approximately 9 AM, Chinese aircraft flew to Weizhou Island for reconnaissance. Japanese soldiers fired at the Chinese aircraft with anti-aircraft machine guns, but all shots missed. The Chinese aircraft completed their mission and returned in formation. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>Wuzhou: Near Weizhou Island, there are currently over 30 Japanese warships, transport ships, and aircraft carriers, carrying over 20,000 Japanese soldiers. The villagers on Weizhou Island are unable to bear the brutality of the Japanese army and are fleeing in large numbers. On the 29th and 30th of last month, over 20 villagers from the island attempted to escape by boat, but they were discovered by the Japanese army, who sent patrol boats to pursue and arrest them. They were killed on the spot, and their corpses were displayed in the market square to intimidate the public, a truly unbearable sight. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>Lian County: The Japanese army has newly transferred two chemical warfare companies from Taiwan to Guangdong, carrying dozens of tons of poison gas, which will be used in the Sanshui River estuary area. (1st Telegraph)</p>
<p>Wuzhou: On the 29th, Japanese warships sent speedboats to survey the waters off Maoming, and landed a small number of infantry at Meicha, attempting to probe the strength of the Chinese defenses. The Chinese army calmly resisted, and the Japanese, realizing they were prepared, retreated immediately. (1st Telegraph) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in Xijiang launched repeated offensives towards Jinli, Mafang, and other locations in the past two days, but were repelled by the Chinese army.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Chinese telegram received here today from Wuzhou, the Japanese army in Xijiang launched a three-pronged attack on Tuesday of this week, attacking Jinli, Mafang, and Huanggang Beishui. The Chinese army bravely resisted, and both sides engaged in fierce fighting all day. The Japanese forces attacking Jinli and Mafang were both repelled by the Chinese army. Huanggang fell into the hands of the Japanese army for a time, but the Chinese army reinforced and counterattacked. After a fierce battle, the Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated to Sanshui. (2nd, Express News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to information received here today, the Japanese army sent over 30 speedboats full of Japanese soldiers, covered by five warships, in an attempt to land near Beihai the day before yesterday morning. They were bravely repelled by the Chinese army. At the time, the Japanese warships fired artillery shells at the shore, and the Chinese army also returned fire. The two sides fought fiercely for three hours before ceasing fire. (2nd, Express News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Navy spokesperson Rear Admiral Kanazawa announced today that Japanese forces occupied Weizhou Island on January 31st. The island is in Tokyo Bay, approximately 40 kilometers from the Beihai Peninsula. According to Kanazawa, the purpose of this action is to intensify the blockade of the southern coast of China and prevent the import of military supplies into China. As for rumors that the Japanese army will occupy Hainan Island, this has not been confirmed as of yet. (2nd, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy spokesperson Rear Admiral Kanazawa declared here today that the Japanese Navy has temporarily occupied Weizhou Island, a strategic location 30 miles due south of Beihai in Tokyo Bay, and stated that the Japanese Navy is paying attention to disrupting the transport of military equipment, as Chinese junks are still transporting military equipment along the coast of southern China. However, he refused to specify where the military equipment and munitions are being transported into China by Chinese junks. Rear Admiral Kanazawa also stated that the commander of the Japanese fleet in the South China Sea had informed third-country authorities in China of the temporary occupation of Weizhou Island on Wednesday by Japanese diplomats, and requested them to advise their nationals owning or piloting aircraft not to fly within 15 miles of Weizhou Island, and to maintain an altitude of no more than 500 meters. The spokesperson also answered a question from a foreign reporter regarding Guam, stating that the Japanese Navy does not object to expanding the port of Guam and building commercial aviation facilities, but Japanese public opinion is extremely agitated about the reported plans to build a fortress on Guam. (2nd, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) At a press conference here today, a Chinese military spokesperson firmly denied reports that Japanese forces had landed in Anpu on January 28th and that bombing and artillery fire had been heard in Guangzhou Bay. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's Guilin headquarters also denied the landing report. Anpu is located on the southwest coast of Guangdong, east of Beihai. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Is Weak; Dreams of Invading the West Become a Bubble; Japan Requests Reinforcements from Tokyo Without Result; There Is Talk That Yi County Has Been Recaptured by the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesperson announced today that the Chinese army has recaptured important cities between the Yellow River and the Fen River in southwestern Shanxi, and the battle situation is improving daily. He also stated that the Japanese army recently requested that Tokyo send four more divisions to China, but the Japanese government was unable to comply and failed to send reinforcements. Therefore, the battle situation in southern and northern China has recently become calm. (2nd, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: There is talk that Yi County has been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army retreating from the Lüliang Mountains has been gradually transferred from Linfen to Quwo in recent days for reorganization. Of the more than 3,000 troops, only 20 artillery pieces remain. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: The Japanese army in Wenshui and Jiaocheng has increased to over 1,000 troops, with 300 cavalry and 5 artillery pieces, and is invading westward in three routes, currently fighting with a Chinese army unit in the Fanjiashan area. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Zhongtiao Mountains are the base for the Chinese army's resistance in southern Shanxi. For over ten days, the Japanese army has launched a three-pronged attack from the north, southwest, and east, but has repeatedly failed. The highlands in the Xia County and Jie County areas are still being firmly held by the Chinese army. The Japanese army attempted to reinforce from Yuxiang and Yongji to the west of the Zhongtiao Mountains, but was intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. The Chinese army is currently fiercely attacking Ruicheng, with hopes of recapturing it. (2nd, Express News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese army spokesperson recently declared to journalists that although the Japanese army intends to invade Shaanxi Province, guerrilla forces are extremely active in the area, and the Japanese army's rear transportation lines are severely disrupted. Therefore, they have been unable to cross the river to invade Shaanxi. The spokesperson stated that the Japanese army cannot cross the Yellow River until it "annihilates" the Chinese army in the mountains of southwestern Shanxi. According to the spokesperson's opinion, if the Japanese army wants to "eliminate" the Chinese army in the mountains of southwestern Shanxi, they must reinforce with more than twice their current force. If the Japanese army cannot "annihilate" the Chinese army in southwestern Shanxi this month, their plan to invade the northwest will become a bubble, as the weather in the northwest is gradually warming, the river ice is gradually melting, and their mechanized units will lose their effectiveness. (2nd, Express News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: The Japanese army in Heshun launched a three-pronged attack towards Liaoxian, but was intercepted by the Chinese army along the way. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses, and a large amount of ammunition, artillery shells, and food were seized. Later, the Japanese army continued to increase their forces and launched a three-pronged attack on Liaoxian at dawn on the 30th, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. The Chinese army, under a three-sided attack from the Japanese army, abandoned Liaoxian. The Japanese army, with about a thousand troops, continued to advance south, and has now reached Liangyu Village, fighting with a unit of a certain Chinese division. Another unit of the Chinese army is still confronting the Japanese army near Liaoxian City. (1st Telegraph)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: The Japanese army, which was repelled by the Chinese army at Shawo Li, southeast of Huo County, launched a fierce attack on Shawo Li again at 7 AM on the 29th, using tear gas. The Chinese army calmly responded and launched a brave pincer attack on the Japanese army with its main force. By 6 PM, the Japanese army collapsed and retreated to the northwest. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the Japanese army fled back to Huo County in a panic. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: The bandit puppet Wang Yan led his troops to attack the Chinese Dahekou Sanmu Ban on the 27th, but was repelled by the Chinese army. (1st Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Approximately 1,000 Japanese troops from Yuxiang attacked from the east and west of Caopo at 4 PM on the 30th, and reached Liu Qi Yao at dawn on the 31st, engaging a Chinese army unit in the vicinity for three hours. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated north. On the 27th, the Japanese army in Jie County besieged the Chinese army at Nanwangquan Temple. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army broke through to the north, killing the commanding officer of the Japanese army's field headquarters. The Japanese army recovered the body. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>[P The Chinese Army Once Recaptured Lu County</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Lu County in Hebei was once recaptured by the Chinese army at dawn on the 31st. The remaining 300 or so Japanese soldiers fled west to a place 20 miles west of the city, where they were ambushed by Chinese troops. Over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese troops attempted to flee west again, but were intercepted by Wang's troops of the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops risked their lives to flee back into the city and are currently surrounded by the Chinese army in street fighting. (2nd Telegraph)</p>

Most of the Japanese army has returned to its original garrison, but a small force of 200 soldiers is currently at Zhongguan in Xinshi. The Chinese army is dispatching troops to intercept them. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<h3>There Is Still Fighting on the Western Hubei Front</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese telegram received here states that although fighting is continuing on the Western Hubei front, no major battle is expected, as most of the Japanese army in the area are troops under Liu Guitang. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army's elite troops, the Japanese army near Tianmen retreated along the highway towards Zao City on Tuesday afternoon. (2nd, Reuters Telegraph</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Suffers Losses at Ma'anshan in Jiangxi</h3>

<h3>The Chinese Army Is Active in Central Hebei and Northern Henan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military authorities here have recently acknowledged that Chinese guerrilla forces in central Hebei and northern Henan are still very active, and the Japanese army is finding it difficult to cope. It is reported that the Ishikawa unit of the Japanese army engaged in a fierce battle with a Chinese army unit near Xincheng, east of Dingxing on the Pinghan Railway in central Hebei, on the 28th of last month. This unit of the Chinese army used Xujiazhuang as a base, and frequently attacked Japanese defense forces near Dingxing and destroyed the railway between Dingxing and Gaobeidian. On the 29th of last month, a unit of the Chinese army was engaged in destroying the railway near Gaozhuangzhen, north of Jixian in northern Henan, when it was discovered by the Funabiki unit of the Japanese army. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army retreated to the northwest. On the 30th of last month, a unit of the Chinese army encountered the Yoneyama unit of the Japanese army at Gugusai, 20 kilometers southeast of Xinxiang. Both sides suffered casualties.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Speeches of the German Head of State, the British Prime Minister, and the American President</h3>
<p>"Don't say that the overall situation is not serious, the crisis still exists," this is what former American President Herbert Hoover loudly called out yesterday in his speech at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. In the past few days, the international situation, which has been frequently endangered, seems to have improved; the world's stock markets have suddenly shown vitality, and market prices have soared, which is the most obvious reflection of people's hearts; however, has the crisis been slightly alleviated? Is it expected to be eliminated? Or is it just a prolongation of the incubation period? From our perspective, we agree with Hoover's statement; moreover, the world is changing rapidly, and although this newspaper has repeatedly discussed the world situation recently, the twists and turns of the past three days are worth continuing to discuss.</p>
<p>In the past three days, there have been no actions in the international arena, only speeches, but it is by no means an exaggeration to say that future important international actions will be closely related to these speeches. There are three main speeches: one was on the evening of the 30th. German Head of State Adolf Hitler's speech in the Greater German Reichstag; the second was on the afternoon of the 31st, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons; the third was on the same day, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt's secret talk with the members of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. The three differ in their form: Hitler's and Chamberlain's speeches were completely public, while what they called secret talks were based on the principle of not announcing them. Hitler's speech was an active and pre-scheduled program, summarizing Germany's domestic and foreign affairs; whether subjective or objective, the main purpose of this speech was to clarify Germany's foreign policy. Although Chamberlain's speech was delivered in the ordinary form of the cabinet reporting to the parliament, it was, in a sense, a planned response to Hitler's speech. Roosevelt's meeting with his Senate Military Committee was called a secret talk, but it spread throughout the world in less than a day, not because of any moral or institutional flaws, or even the inability to keep it secret; it was a political and diplomatic necessity to use a semi-veiled strategy. Three days ago, everyone thought that the content of Hitler's speech would be tense, but who knew that his attitude would be to keep the sword in its sheath; Chamberlain responded with goodwill, and everyone was happy; and Roosevelt's expression that if Britain and France were in trouble, he would definitely give them strong support, was no less than hearing the sound of footsteps in an empty valley.</p>
<p>After hearing the three men's speeches, we deeply feel that the causes of international disputes are not only without any signs of resolution, but also that the opportunity to find a solution is still far away. Not only is it far away, but there is no reason to be optimistic about whether there is a possibility or hope of resolution in the first place. Since the crisis comes from the causes of disputes, how can we hope that the crisis will be resolved before the disputes are resolved; looking to the future, it is dark and bleak, and the overall situation is indeed difficult. What is slightly comforting is that this time, although Hitler's tone did not loosen, he did not promote the crisis, and his reckless impulse to ignore everything can sometimes be restrained; this is new information that can be used for evaluation after this speech. Chamberlain's show of goodwill to Britain has nothing to do with the causes of disputes, so it is not enough to ease the crisis; however, on Chamberlain's side, perhaps this will slightly strengthen his confidence in his policy of appeasement, or perhaps he will not fail this show of goodwill and will try something? Saying that "if the international atmosphere is not good, it is useless to conduct negotiations in order to resolve disputes, satisfy wishes, and eliminate resentment," seems to be a retreat; however, hinting that "even if countries cannot disarm, at least they should have the intention to limit armaments; if such an opportunity arrives, the people of the United Kingdom will not only extend their sympathy, but will also do their best to appease the general situation in Europe, which can be asserted," is a broad stroke, and the meaning is extremely commendable. If world public opinion temporarily abandons the distinction between current gains and losses, and devotes itself to this; and if Germany and Italy can also slightly restrain their current wishes, and recognize the importance of disarmament; then, given time, the focus of disputes may shift one day, and there may be hope for the easing of emotional friction?</p>
<p>Of the three speeches, only Roosevelt's secret talk cannot be regarded as the formal expression of the United States; because the publication was not done through a normal announcement, but through circuitous disclosure; it is not said that the president said this, nor that the committee members said this, but that the reporter heard it like this. Therefore, its generating power will be weaker than that of public speeches. Indeed, from the revelation of the president's ideas to becoming the country's established national policy, there should be a considerable distance in between; moreover, in fact, the politics and society of the United States are colorful and all-encompassing, and there must be people who want to come out and obstruct the president, without necessarily having any sound theories, or any brilliant insights, taking the opportunity to play up the issue, eager to try. However, in terms of Roosevelt's attitude, it is worth ten or a hundred times more than the speeches of Hitler and Chamberlain. This newspaper discussed it five days ago, believing that in order to eliminate the world crisis, the "only hope is that the major powers will step forward boldly and resolutely express that the democratic countries will share weal and woe," who knew that two days later it would be obtained from the expression of the American president; this is enough to make warmongers have scruples and restrain themselves a little. The United States has many wise men, who will surely create a strong public opinion, urging Congress to unanimously support the president's attitude and form the country's unwavering national policy? This will be the dawn of human civilization and the gospel of world peace.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Are Using False Pretenses to Call for Peace; Mass Organizations in North China Send Telegrams to the Entire Country, Denouncing Their Falsehoods; Using Peace as Bait to Secretly Deploy Military Forces; Intending to Divide the Forces of Resistance and Allow Them to Be Slaughtered; It Is Essential to Discern Their Treacherous Plans and Persist in Resistance to the End</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese army, having expended troops on a long expedition and achieved nothing after a long war, has recently issued telegrams in the name of Chinese mass organizations and non-governmental celebrities, calling for peace. Their intention is to divide the Chinese forces of resistance. The masses in North China have discerned their treachery and recently sent telegrams to the entire country denouncing their falsehoods. The original telegram is as follows: "To all agencies, newspapers, and compatriots nationwide, be aware that the enemy has achieved nothing after a long war, their military and financial resources are increasingly exhausted, and their diplomacy has also fallen into isolation. They are compelled to seek peace urgently. Knowing that our government is determined and their treacherous schemes will not succeed, they have been issuing telegrams calling for peace in the name of various mass organizations or non-governmental celebrities such as Wu Peifu, with more moderate wording than before. However, the enemy's military deployment is still proceeding relentlessly. It is clear that the enemy's goal is to use peace as bait, to divide our battle lines, and to allow us to be slaughtered at their mercy after we are divided and discouraged. Their treacherous scheme is extremely vicious. We must discern the enemy's plan, persist in resistance to the end, and strive for final victory. No matter how difficult, this will not change." Signed, Thirty-three organizations of the masses in North China. (2nd Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, all Chinese newspapers published news of Wu Peifu's meeting with reporters in Beiping in prominent positions. They all claimed that Wu's remarks had indeed proved that: 1. Wu had no intention of becoming a Japanese puppet; 2. News regarding Wu's attitude was purely fabricated by the Japanese to confuse the Chinese and foreign masses. (2nd (Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) At a press conference here today, a Chinese military spokesperson declared that the Japanese authorities must agree to restore China's political integrity before Wu Peifu would agree to come out of retirement, and that Wu's remarks had been altered by the Japanese to suit their own purposes. (1st, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese-controlled newspaper reported that Wu Peifu met with foreign reporters on January 31st, and "accepted Japan's conditions" as a prerequisite for taking office. However, according to Wu's confidants, Wu was very angry about this report, as he had not accepted Japan's conditions, and even declared that the Japanese army must withdraw from certain areas so that he could govern the area. He said he did not want to come out of retirement. According to some sources, Wu has never made a statement opposing the National Government, but he is very opposed to the Communists. The Japanese attempt to use Wu to preside over a mass movement and thus achieve a peaceful settlement does not seem likely to succeed. (2nd, Reuters Telegraph</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports received by political figures here, Wu Peifu would only agree to take office as chairman of the "Pacification Committee" in Kaifeng if the Japanese accepted the conditions he put forward. The conditions he put forward to the Japanese were: 1. The Japanese army must withdraw from China; 2. All political power in areas occupied by the Japanese army (including "Manchukuo") must be returned to China; 3. Japan must not interfere in China's internal affairs and diplomacy.

<h3>After Taking Office, Xue Yue Convenes a Meeting of the Entire Provincial Committee; Strictly Orders All Areas to Eliminate Bandits; The Municipal Government of Hedong Is Temporarily Abolished; An Office of the Provincial Government Is Established in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Changsha) After taking office, Xue Yue convened the entire Provincial Committee for the first meeting on the afternoon of the first day, and decided on the following important cases: 1. Strictly order all area security commanders and county magistrates to completely eliminate bandits within their borders by the end of March this year, and use this as a standard for evaluation, with rewards and punishments accordingly; 2. The Changsha Municipal Government will be temporarily abolished, and an administrative section will be set up in the Changsha County Police Bureau to handle administrative matters. The villages and towns under the jurisdiction of the municipality will be transferred to the Changsha County Government for management; 3. An office of the Hunan Provincial Government will be established in Chongqing; 4. The name of Hengshan Experimental County will be abolished, and it will be changed to a first-class county. Xue also telegraphed all subordinate departments in the province, saying, "At a time when military affairs are tense and the Lunar New Year is approaching, it is urgent to stabilize social order. You must earnestly formulate preventive measures, maintain local security, and be at ease in your duties, without harboring thoughts of waiting and seeing or attempting to shirk responsibility."

<h3>Chen Cheng Reports on One Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chen Cheng reports on the one-week war situation "from January 25th to 31st" as follows:</p>
<p>The war situation this week shows increasing advantages for us on both the northern and southern fronts. Considering the overall development of the war, it can be judged that the enemy troops are increasingly trapped in a quagmire, while our troops are moving closer to a turning point towards victory. Since last year, the enemy has been clamoring that they would gather all sorts of evil-doers to invade Shaanxi in the west and attack from the south and north, to fulfill their deluded dream of cutting off our international supply routes in the northwest and southwest. In reality, the enemy headquarters absolutely cannot fulfill the requests of the enemy chiefs stationed in both the north and south of China to mobilize four and six and a half divisions of troops, respectively. Therefore, the empty threats made for many days have only become a source of ridicule. Now, the overall war situation is described separately as follows:</p>
<p>In the Guangdong area, the enemy along the Guangzhou-Hankou, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways has not shown any unusual movements in the past week, and the situation is very calm. After Hua County was attacked by two or three thousand enemy troops last week, our main forces launched an active counterattack this week, and the enemy troops were unable to withstand it and collapsed. Hua County has been officially recovered by our troops. There are no enemy traces in the nearby military fields. Small scattered groups of the enemy have been routed towards the Taiping Chang area by our division and local police, who have launched a two-pronged attack. The enemy trapped in Guangzhou has thus returned to our encirclement and cannot move. Although there are more than two thousand enemy troops gathered on Zhou Island, most of them are Korean and Shandong puppet troops, with very few regular troops. Enemy warships are constantly patrolling the waters near Beihai, which proves the exhaustion of the enemy's strength.</p>
<p>In the Shanxi area, since our army successively recovered important strongholds such as Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Suixian in western Shanxi the week before last, the enemy's invasion of northern Shaanxi has become a pipe dream. After suffering heavy losses, they turned to invade the southwestern Shanxi triangular area, ignoring the failure of mobilizing troops for months and sacrificing manpower in the past. They launched a desperate attack on our heroic soldiers defending the Zhongtiao Mountains, hoping to lay the foundation for future westward invasion by sweeping through this triangular area. About three thousand enemy troops, starting from Jiexian with seven cannons and one bomber, invaded our Zhongtiao Mountain positions in three routes. At the same time, the enemy also sent more than two thousand troops to invade Heshun from Xiyang in eastern Shanxi, echoing each other from afar. After our officers and soldiers fought desperately in recent days, the enemy at Jiexian has collapsed and fled after suffering heavy casualties of more than a thousand. Although our army temporarily withdrew from Heshun, after heavily injuring the enemy commander Takahashi, more than a thousand enemies were annihilated at Guandi Temple, Zilu, and Shengchuan. The enemy did not dare to advance further, and our goal of depleting the enemy's forces has been achieved.</p>
<p>In the Hunan-Hubei area, the war situation in northern Hunan is calm. Most of the enemy troops stationed in the Yueyang area have withdrawn to northern Hubei and concentrated in Huangpi Xiaogan, seemingly preparing to take action. However, the war situation in Jingshan in central Hubei and Zhe River in northern Hubei in recent days has made any enemy dreams impossible. After Jingshan and Menxian were successively lost last week, our army launched a brave counterattack, and Jingshan was once recovered. We are still fighting fiercely with the enemy in the western suburbs of the county town, and we are still holding strong positions and actively advancing. In the battle of Guanyin Rock, an estimated eight or nine hundred enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy commander of the Zhe River front, Major General Fujita, and the squadron leader Maruta were both killed by our forces. The enemy forces in that area have suffered a total of more than three thousand casualties in the past month, crushing the enemy's planned invasion plot.</p>
<p>Other war situations: In the Henan area, the enemy in northern Henan launched an attack on our position from Bo'ai and Xiuwu with more than two thousand main forces this week. After our army desperately resisted, more than four hundred enemy soldiers were killed, and the remaining enemy soldiers fled in disarray. More than two thousand enemy puppet troops in Weishi County in southern Henan attempted to cross the Yellow River to invade westward and have been completely annihilated. In the Anhui area, more than three thousand enemy soldiers who previously invaded us from Wanzhi were severely attacked by our aircraft last week, leaving only eight hundred or so remnants to flee, losing more than two-thirds. In the Hebei area, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in Julu, and captured many. In the Suiyuan area, there have been no changes since the enemy's attempt to invade Dongsheng failed last week. However, three to four thousand puppet troops, including the 4th and 6th divisions of the puppet autonomous army stationed in Guyang Wuchuan and the puppet army of Wang Shengchen stationed in Qingling River, have defected and returned to our side one after another, which has dealt a severe blow to the enemy forces in that area.</p>
<p>Overall, the war situation this week shows that although the enemy is clamoring about what they will do to us, in reality, they are showing their weakness and exhaustion. However, the enemy has not completely given up their final attempt. Observing the enemy's movements against our positions in the triangular area of southern Shanxi and the active increase of enemy puppet troops on Pizhou Island, we can see a glimpse of the enemy's future trends. Moreover, the enemy has recently been forcibly conscripting our young men into the army in various occupied areas in the north and south. Although the strong belief of our people in resisting the war has prevented the enemy's plan from succeeding, their ambition and cunning plan to remedy the shortage of troops are becoming increasingly intense. It can be asserted that the prelude to the fierce battle between us and the enemy is like a bow drawn to its limit, ready to be triggered at any moment. (1st dispatch)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Word Carries Weight: European War Can Be Temporarily Avoided; Isolationists in the US Senate Are Powerless; Hoover's Speech Constrains Presidential Policy; Britain and France Value It Greatly; Germany Is Very Angry</h3>
<p>(London) European figures believe that President Roosevelt's view of the current state of military affairs is extremely important in this tense political situation. British and French figures believe that President Roosevelt's willingness to help European democratic countries reorganize their military is a great contribution to restoring the balance of power. This contribution is enough to stop the progress of dictators and may save the world from war. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) All newspapers here today printed President Roosevelt's remarks to the Senate Military Committee on Tuesday on the front page, and some newspapers criticized it in editorials. The News Chronicle stated that what the US President said was the truth, and that the gains and losses of the concepts that the United States maintains in the world must not be in the Mississippi River in the United States, but in the Rhine River in Europe. The Daily Herald stated that President Roosevelt's attitude has prevented war from happening. However, the Daily Express is not so optimistic. The newspaper warned readers not to read too much into the words, saying that President Roosevelt sympathizes with democratic countries, but his attitude is nothing more than an attitude of doing things with common sense. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) President Roosevelt's assurances to democratic countries have made a significant and strong impression here, but it is not believed that the President's words contain the meaning that the United States will send a large army to Europe if the totalitarian countries go to war with the democratic countries of Britain and France one day. However, it is believed that the power of his words cannot be matched by the ordinary evidence of the spiritual unity of European and American democratic countries. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, German newspapers launched a massive attack on President Roosevelt, accusing him of being a war instigator and a supporter of communism. The People's Observer accused President Roosevelt of wanting to put the world in a catastrophe for the benefit of the Jews. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers expressed outrage at the news that US President Roosevelt was discussing with the Senate Military Committee the supply of arms to various democratic countries. The headlines used included "The American Border Is on the Rhine" and "Roosevelt's Incredible Provocation." Official circles regarded this news as unofficial and unconfirmed, so they ignored it. German political figures said that if the news of the secret meeting reported in the American newspapers is true, then President Roosevelt's remarks are extremely strange, because they are nothing less than wanting to disturb Hitler's peaceful policies and prevent Europe from achieving true peace and prosperity. At this point, we cannot help but think that the United States must have encountered difficulties, so it is advocating such martial preparations in order to whitewash such unsatisfactory events. One newspaper reported, "This American action is unprecedented since the Great War. President Roosevelt has undoubtedly become Wilson II, and the United States has finally abandoned its neutral policy." (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers have commented very little on US President Roosevelt's statement that the country's border is in France, only saying that Roosevelt's "new policy" is not approved by the American people and has aroused "resentment" in Berlin. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) A group is now apparently organized in the Senate to oppose President Roosevelt's aid to democratic countries other than participating in the war. This group may develop and have the same power as before to prevent the United States from joining the League of Nations and the World Court. However, President Roosevelt's position under the Constitution is extremely solid, because it does not involve the issue of concluding treaties. Therefore, the Senate's power to interfere with the President's foreign policy is still limited. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York World-Telegram commented on the new change in American foreign policy indicated by President Roosevelt's consultation with the Senate Military Committee on Tuesday, saying that the foremost barrier to American peace and security is not in the Atlantic Ocean, but in Britain and France, which is now obvious. What Britain and France will encounter is a special interest in exchanging cash for the most important and most threatened vanguard corner of strengthening our national defense. Our luck in making this transaction is incredible. In terms of national defense, the value of an aircraft delivered to Britain and France is ten times more than many aircraft delivered to the US Air Force in the next six months. At the same time, isolationist Senators Clark and Nye demanded that the records of the Senate Military Committee's investigation into France's purchase of aircraft be published. Nye said that he intended to boycott future meetings of the Military Committee, which completely exceeded the steps that should be taken in democratic practice. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although people here feel differently about President Roosevelt's consultation with the Senate Military Committee and its secret situation, they all expect that the President's remarks will be a sign that the ban on the shipment of arms, bullets, and aircraft to belligerent countries will be lifted when the neutrality law is amended in May. According to one commentator, in the event of a war, the United States will become the largest source of arms supply in world history. The United States' great productivity can manufacture aircraft, cannons, tanks, food, and clothing at an unparalleled speed. Yesterday, congressional isolationists protested because the President kept the proceedings of the meeting secret, but the reactions from other parties were more favorable. Senate President Pro Tempore Pittman declared, "Refusing to supply the democratic countries with preparations for defending themselves is tantamount to helping the powers engaged in threats." The remarks made by Republican Senator Johnson can represent the opinions of isolationists. He said, "The American people should have the right to know whether the meaning of the United States selling aircraft to Britain and France is that the United States has embarked on the path of war. Matters that are not only related to the Senate but also to all the people of our country are secretly told to the Senate Committee, which is to allow the facts to be distorted and misunderstood. Regarding the possibility of amending the neutrality law, Johnson believed that Britain and France would be the first to benefit from it, because the US insistence on cash and self-transportation as the basis for purchasing its goods is naturally beneficial to countries with the largest navy and merchant fleet and the largest gold reserves. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The matter of the United States selling aircraft to certain countries was recently brought up for discussion in the Senate. Chairman Pittman of the Foreign Relations Committee expressed his support for President Roosevelt's policies, saying, "Certain countries are posing threats to democratic countries. If we do not allow democratic countries to have the power to defend themselves, it is tantamount to helping the tyrant." Democratic Senator Clark of Missouri and Democratic Senator Johnson of Colorado said that the results of the Senate Military Committee's investigation into the issue of selling aircraft to certain countries, as well as the accidental death of French aviation representative Schmidlin during a bomber test flight, should be submitted to the Senate. Johnson also said that the policy of supporting democratic countries is enough to invite crisis, so the process of this case should be thoroughly understood by the American people. Republican Senator Nye said that it is inappropriate for the Army Committee to hold secret meetings and not allow the American people to know the truth about the country's policies. He has decided to refuse to attend the committee to protest. Democratic Senator Minton of Indiana and Democratic Senator Clark of Missouri have also decided to give speeches, and therefore, this matter may transform into a debate on foreign policy, which is not necessarily impossible. In addition, the leader of the Democratic Party caucus, Senator Barkley of Kentucky, supported the government's views and argued that the explanations heard by the Army Committee should be kept secret to prevent American secrets from leaking to foreign countries. Several other senators said that the proceedings of the Army Committee meeting yesterday were leaked to the press, which was inappropriate. The Army Committee is scheduled to hold a secret meeting again on the 5th of this month. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding President Roosevelt's meeting with the members of the Senate Military Committee, all newspapers praised it. Among them, the New York newspapers and major newspapers from other cities welcomed the President's promise to supply arms to various democratic countries. However, some newspapers believed that the President should not keep such matters secret from the Senate, but should speak to the Army Committee. The New York Evening Post stated that the President needs to make the people aware of the truth about the international situation, and the President should pay attention to this matter. "The United States is now better prepared to deal with the crisis than it was between 1914 and 1917. We agree with the President's expression of sympathy to various democratic countries. The President views the threats posed to the world by various dictatorships as increasing, and the democratic countries must therefore act in unison. We also have the same feeling." The New York Times stated that we should be wary of German leader Hitler. "Looking at the various events of the past year, the surface posture of the National Socialist foreign policy is often contrary to its inner workings." His annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia can be taken as a lesson. As for the American view of Germany, when President Roosevelt spoke to the Senate Army Committee yesterday, he may not have clearly stated that the American border is in France, but the President deeply believes that France is a friendly country that we should care about and must cooperate to maintain, just as it is a barrier for our country. Anyone who has listened to the President's speech will be able to fully feel this." (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today still demanded that President Roosevelt explain to the people his policy of helping Britain and France reorganize their military. Republican Senator Johnson said, "The current problem is that we are about to take actions that will involve us in the war without letting the people know." Democratic Senator Clark also said, "The boundary line of the United States has now been extended to the Rhine region," and said that unless the government quickly clarifies its policy, he will request the Senate to review it. Furthermore, this action to help France expand its air force will hinder the completion of the American air force plan, and he demanded that the Senate Military Committee publish its records and the proceedings of its secret meeting with President Roosevelt. It is said that the predictions of the American ambassadors to Britain and France in the Senate Committee that war would break out in Europe this spring and the comments about the inadequacy of British and French military preparations were completely inciting the hearing of the committee. However, in the midst of various opinions, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Barkley, stood up and declared that if the United States sold aircraft to a peaceful country, how could it involve the United States in a whirlpool? At that time, Johnson said, "The problem is in the secrecy, and everything must be careful at the beginning, and it will surely lead to great disaster in the future. Therefore, we must know the truth about our actions in advance." (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressional figures declared today that although some people in the Senate have protested and plan to investigate the secret sale of arms by the United States to Britain and France, the number is still not very large. Some people have criticized President Roosevelt for instructing the Senate Military Committee to keep it a secret, but most of them are Republicans and Democrats who have disagreements with the government. Democratic Senator Clark of the Senate demanded that the details of the United States selling aircraft to France be published. The Senate Military Committee will consider this suggestion tomorrow. It is said that in the 18-member committee, there are five Republicans and at least two Democrats who will support Clark's proposal. (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chicago) Former US President Hoover gave a speech at the Foreign Relations Association today and heavily criticized President Roosevelt's "new foreign policy." Hoover said, "Direct or indirect oppression of foreign countries will cause war. Strong countries encountering such pressure will rise up and make bloody resistance. Anyone who thinks about economic sanctions must think about war. It is delirium to say that Japan, Germany, Italy, or the Soviet Union, or these countries united, will make a military attack on the Western Hemisphere." Hoover said that Roosevelt's policy means that the United States must decide who is the aggressor. Roosevelt's policy is very likely to provoke retaliatory action and must have sufficient preparations to back it up. He said that the invasion of communism, national socialism, and fascism is an international problem that cannot be repelled by warships or aircraft. Hoover continued that another great war may make dictatorship popular all over the world, and the United States may adopt such a system. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chicago) Former President Hoover (Republican) gave a speech at the Foreign Affairs Association last night, opposing isolationism. He said, "The United States is now facing two threats, one is the military aggression of various totalitarian countries, and the other is the invasion of totalitarian ideas, which is intended to destroy democracy. The first threat can be viewed in two ways, one is the direct threat to the Western Hemisphere, and the other is the indirect threat due to our concern for various democratic allies in Europe and Asia. Although military aggression is not easy to carry out, if various totalitarian countries attack our country regardless of right and wrong, they will definitely encounter extremely strong defense and retreat. As for ideological invasion, this is a domestic political problem. We must know that various ideas cannot be destroyed by warships or aircraft. "We also have no intention of attacking various dictatorial countries or hoping to fundamentally eradicate the ideas of various countries, because fighting for ideas will also have destructive consequences, and the severity of the disaster may surpass the religious wars of the Middle Ages. We only want to prevent non-American ideas from invading America. The only way to do this is to ban communism, national socialism, fascism, and the members of these parties from America, so that our country's various facilities will not be eroded by them. Hoover then discussed the European situation, saying, "We must not think that it is not serious. We must know that the crisis does exist, but its urgency is not as great as that revealed in various speeches. Since the crisis is imminent, there are often ways to eliminate it." His conclusion is that the American people should now unhesitatingly express their indignation at various injustices and exclusions, and provide assistance to suffering humanity. "We should not stick to isolationism, but should maintain peace in a peaceful way and cooperate with other countries economically to restore prosperity. However, it is not possible to correct unfair things or establish lasting peace with military threats, economic pressure, or war. This is what we have truly known and seen based on reason, history, and past experience." (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding President Roosevelt's conversation with members of the Senate Army Committee on the matter of the United States selling aircraft to certain countries, a senator recently confirmed the situation to a visitor from the Havas News Agency. President Roosevelt told the members that the world situation was like a "volcano about to erupt." Once it erupts, no matter what policies the United States pursues, it will inevitably be affected. It is appropriate to cooperate with various democratic countries, which has only advantages and no disadvantages. Britain and France bear the heaviest burden in the conflict between democratic and totalitarian ideologies. The United States can still stay out of it, but if Britain and France are defeated, the republics of North and South America will become the last barrier of democracy, and the disaster will be imminent. Even at this moment, if various totalitarian countries are allowed to expand their territories, the republics of America will definitely be affected. In addition, a member of the Senate Army Committee also told the Havas News Agency that President Roosevelt had said yesterday that in addition to Britain and France, the United States is also willing to sell arms to "other independent countries in Europe" that are fighting against the aggression of various dictatorships.

<h3>German Trade: Significant Import Surplus Last Year; Exports to China Down 30%; Exports to Japan Also Down Over 20%</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German trade showed an import surplus of 192,000,000 marks last year, compared to an export surplus of 413,000,000 marks the previous year. Imports for the year totaled 5,449,000,000 marks, and exports totaled 5,237,000,000 marks. The export amount was 531,000,000 marks lower than the previous year. Exports to the UK decreased by 81,000,000 marks, and exports to the Soviet Union decreased by 85,000,000 marks, equivalent to a drop of 75%. Exports to China decreased by approximately 49,000,000 marks, a decrease of 33%. Exports to Japan decreased by 24,000,000 marks, a decrease of 21%. Exports to India decreased by slightly more than 37,000,000 marks. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) When Chancellor Hitler delivered a speech on the 30th of last month, he mentioned that Germany must develop its export industry. It was widely rumored that Dr. Schacht, the former governor of the central bank, had been ordered to take charge of this. However, well-informed sources here have denied this, stating that Dr. Schacht has not been assigned any special mission since leaving office. (2nd Havas)</p>
<h3>Bank of England Gold Reserves to Be Revalued; Revaluation to Be Done Weekly; Banknotes Reduced to £30 Million</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon proposed a bill to the House of Commons, requesting permission for the government to revalue the Bank of England's cash reserves and temporarily reduce the amount of banknotes in circulation from £400,000,000 to £300,000,000. For over two hundred years, the value of gold held by the Bank of England has been fixed at 85 shillings per ounce (the current market price is over 140 shillings). It is now proposed to revalue it weekly according to the market price. After the valuation, a comparison will be made between the statutory reserve ratio and the amount of banknotes in circulation. If there is a surplus in the reserve ratio, it will be used to replenish the Exchange Equalisation Account. (2nd Havas)</p>
<p>(London) On January 6, the Treasury increased the amount of banknotes in circulation to £400 million, based on the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928, and planned to transfer the Bank of England's gold reserves to the Exchange Equalisation Account. At that time, the government stated that it would propose a bill to amend this when Parliament convened. Chancellor Simon has now submitted this amendment to the House of Commons. According to the bill, all gold and other assets of the Bank of England's Issue Department will be revalued at market prices. If the total value exceeds the total amount of banknotes in circulation, the excess will be transferred to the Exchange Equalisation Account. If there is a shortfall, it will be made up from the Exchange Equalisation Account. The gold held by the Bank of England is currently valued at the old price of 85 shillings per ounce. According to the amendment, the value of the gold reserves will increase along with the current market price. Since the gold remains in the Issue Department, the amount of banknotes in circulation can be set at £300 million, rather than the current temporary amount of £400 million. It is said that the purpose of transferring the gold reserves is to strengthen the Exchange Equalisation Account, so that it has sufficient financial resources to cope with any situation. Today, various circles in London are discussing the significance of revaluing the Bank of England's gold reserves. The stock market's buying momentum is gradually increasing, believing that when Chancellor Simon is considering how to deal with large military expenditures, the £94 million gained from revaluing gold reserves is a very welcome source of income. Even if the ratio between this year's tax revenue and military borrowing can be maintained, taxpayers will still have to bear an additional burden of £100 million to £150 million, or pay an additional two or three shillings of income tax per pound. In practice, this kind of burden is obviously difficult to implement. Chancellor Simon will probably use the surplus gained from revaluing gold reserves instead of increasing the burden on taxpayers. As a result, stock market prices have risen and there are many buyers of gold mining stocks, because the revaluation of gold is clear proof that the government is confident that it can maintain the current value of gold in the long term. At the same time, the British monetary system will also become more stable as a result, and government bonds will benefit accordingly. (1st Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the bill proposed by Chancellor Simon to the House of Commons regarding the revaluation of the Bank of England's cash reserves, stating that Britain's "managed" financial system is becoming more and more apparent. What this bill stipulates is that the original statutory value of cash reserves will be raised to be commensurate with the market price. In addition, there is another key point, namely that the valuation of cash reserves at market prices is not immutable. In the future, it must be adjusted weekly according to market fluctuations. The scope of application of this method is not limited to the cash reserves of the bank's Issue Department, but also to all securities reserves of the department, which must be handled uniformly every week. This new system is called the "market price gold standard." In other words, according to past practice, the bank's banknote issuance volume was transferred based on the amount of cash reserves. In the future, the opposite is true, that is, the total issuance volume has a fixed number, and the issuance reserves are transferred based on the market price and the banknote issuance volume. (2nd Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political figures here unanimously praised the British authorities' decision to revalue the Bank of England's cash reserves, and said that the French authorities had also taken the same measures, which shows that the UK and France are adopting the same policies on finance.

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses Policy of Appeasing the European Situation; Colonies and Disarmament Should Be Discussed Together; Germany Still Unwilling to Mix Them</h3>
<p>(London) The cabinet held a meeting this morning at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, and then continued the meeting this afternoon in the Prime Minister's office in the Houses of Parliament. It was also decided to convene another meeting tomorrow morning. Prime Minister Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace at 6 p.m. to meet with King George VI and present his report. Conservative Party sources claimed that the reason the cabinet has been meeting repeatedly is that German Chancellor Hitler's recent speech was not aggressive, and Prime Minister Chamberlain is preparing to negotiate with Germany on the issue of returning Germany's old colonies, but on the condition that Germany agrees to sign a public arms limitation agreement. The first cabinet meeting this morning focused on Hitler's speech and the Spanish issue. Regarding the speech, the Foreign Office had made startling predictions beforehand, which later proved to be inaccurate. Certain cabinet members immediately expressed their dissatisfaction. In general, the cabinet has decided to continue to pursue a policy of compromise and appeasement, while continuing to accelerate the expansion of armaments. Regarding the Spanish issue, according to reports from Burgos, Spain, the Nationalists' victory is becoming more and more certain. After the end of the civil war, General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalists, also intends to withdraw foreign volunteers. Therefore, Britain's current policy, namely the non-intervention policy, should still be maintained. The second cabinet meeting this afternoon discussed domestic issues. According to certain Conservative Party figures, if Mussolini's speech at the Fascist Party Supreme Council on the 4th of this month proves that the international situation has eased, Prime Minister Chamberlain should consider holding a general election. The cabinet meeting tomorrow morning will focus on discussing agricultural issues. In addition, the words of U.S. President Roosevelt yesterday to the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the sale of American aircraft to various democratic countries are highly valued by the British Cabinet, and are considered to be the most important development in diplomacy since the end of the European War. It is also possible that the cabinet meeting tomorrow will discuss the report submitted by the British Embassy in the United States. (1st Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Chancellor Hitler's speech, the demand for Germany to restore its old colonies has taken priority, and is related to "Italy's inherent wishes." Those in charge do not shy away from this. As for the view that the colonial demands should be sought within the scope of a general solution to European problems, it is rejected. It is generally said that Germany's restoration of its old colonies should not be attached to any conditions. In addition, observers also stated that the Chancellor's speech stated, "I believe that lasting peace can be established," but this sentence was not included in the English and French translations prepared by the Propaganda Department for foreign journalists on that day, but was inserted by the Chancellor at the last minute. The significance of this is noteworthy. As for the tone of the newspapers, in addition to emphasizing that the contradiction between "rich countries" and "poor countries" is deepening, they also protested against the misrepresentation of the Chancellor's speech regarding the joint relationship between Germany and Italy by certain foreign newspapers, stating that if the legitimate demands of Germany and Italy are not met, and a war is caused as a result, the responsibility cannot be borne by Germany and Italy. In addition, the Chancellor's admission that Germany has encountered economic difficulties is very meaningful, because in the past, government authorities have always been tight-lipped about the country's economic difficulties, fearing that it would cause public anxiety. Now that the Chancellor has frankly admitted it, this is probably a sign of a change in Germany's domestic and foreign policies. In terms of foreign affairs, the German authorities want to use economic difficulties as an argument to prove that colonial demands and export promotion policies are fully justified. In terms of domestic affairs, the German authorities want to use this argument to demand that the people continue to make sacrifices, and attribute the responsibility for these sacrifices to "rich countries," and show that they are turning a blind eye to the suffering of the German people.

<h3>Balkans: Brewing Changes; Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: In the past half month, there have been widespread rumors in southeastern Europe that borders may change. It is expected that the Balkan Entente countries will try to improve relations between Romania and Bulgaria at their meeting here next month, and enable Bulgaria to join the Balkan Entente. However, Bulgaria's accession to the Balkan Entente would inevitably require it to abandon its claims to Dobruja, which Bulgaria may not be willing to do. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: Well-informed sources here say that Romania has sent a large number of reinforcements to Dobruja in the past few days, because the Bulgarian parliament recently made statements about the minority platform, which Romania is worried and uneasy about. (2nd Reuters)</p>

<h3>Romanian Cabinet Reshuffle; Fascists Strictly Prohibited</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: After the Cristescu cabinet submitted its resignation, King Carol II immediately ordered Cristescu to organize a new cabinet, which has been completed and was sworn in at 7:30 p.m. The important cabinet members are as follows:</p>

<h3>Spanish Parliament Meets; Prime Minister Speaks; Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Figueres: The Congress of Deputies of the Spanish Republic held a meeting at 10 p.m. last night in the basement of an old fortress in this city, and unanimously approved the anti-war policy of the Republican government. The date and location of the meeting were kept strictly secret beforehand, and were only announced yesterday evening. 62 deputies from anti-fascist parties attended, and the remaining 102 were unable to attend due to the war. (2nd Havas)</p>
<p>Figueres: At the meeting of the Congress of Deputies last night, Prime Minister Negrín delivered a speech explaining the reasons on which the government's policy of fighting to the end is based. He said that the government forces can continue to fight in Catalonia, and even if they are forced to withdraw from Catalonia in the future, they will continue to fight in the central and southern theaters. The Republican government is fighting for the country's independence and survival. Victory means freedom and autonomy, and defeat means that other countries will use all means under a totalitarian system to control our country. At that time, Spain will exist in name only. In addition, our country's war has global significance. The Republican government has previously announced a 13-point program, which can be summarized into the following three major principles: 1. Guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of Spain; 2. Guarantee the right of self-determination for the people of this country; 3. Once the war is over, national discipline must be maintained and the movement to exclude dissidents caused by the civil war must be stopped. (2nd Havas)</p>
<p>Burgos: General Jordana, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nationalist government, told the Havas News Agency special envoy: "At this point in time, the world should recognize that there is no other government in Spain except the Nationalist government. The Nationalists' recapture of Barcelona is of great significance in international politics. In military terms, the morale of the Nationalist army is high and its strength is sufficient, which the demoralized Red Army cannot hope to match. Therefore, all countries should recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain. If this can be done, it will not only end the Spanish civil war, but also guarantee European peace." (2nd Havas)</p>

<h3>Japanese Parliament: Complex Discussions; Still the Same Old Tune</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 1st, the general budget committee of the House of Representatives entered a state of close combat. The main points of the debate focused on: 1. The cabinet increasing the number of cabinet members from political parties; 2. Whether the policies of former Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, incumbent Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki are different; 3. Whether to demand reparations from China; 4. Whether to respect the interests of third countries in China. First, Seto, a member of the Seiyukai, asked that Prime Minister Hiranuma had said in his speech that he respected the position of political parties, but the current cabinet only has two political party cabinet members, which is not enough to show that the current cabinet respects political parties. He should increase the number as soon as possible, so as to achieve the actual effect of national unity. Hiranuma only replied that his cabinet was formed based on talent, regardless of whether they were political party members, but he would fully respect the position of political parties. Seto also asked whether it was rumored that the policies of the former and current foreign and army ministers were quite different. Hiranuma only answered from the side that no country in the world has an unchanging policy. Representative Mui asked whether third countries would be compensated for the damages caused by Japan's military actions in China. Arita replied that Japan might automatically provide relief, but had no intention of paying compensation. Arita then increased his tone and said that a certain department of the recent cabinet advocated taking a more active attitude and declaring that a state of war already existed, so under military action, the interests of third countries in China need not be considered. Seiyukai member Eto asked, why not demand "reparations" from China? He also asked whether the four principles for resolving the war proposed by Hirota had not changed. Arita replied that Japan's fundamental policy towards China remained unchanged. Although Konoe's statement on December 22 was different from previous statements, this was the result of environmental changes, but Konoe's statement has not changed so far. Watanabe, a member of the Minseito, asked about the security situation in North China. Itagaki replied that the troops had recently been concentrated in the "occupied areas" to maintain security in the area as much as possible. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the meeting of the House of Peers this morning, Baron Sakamoto asked Navy Minister Yonai to recently guarantee the defense security of the Pacific to the whole country. He wondered whether this included the fuel issue. Baron Itaya also spoke about the US's fortification of the Aleutian Islands and Guam, and the importance of Japan's sufficient supply of kerosene, and advocated a three-year plan to develop oil fields, with the government subsidizing 300 million yuan in funding. Itaya went on to mention rumors that the UK and the US were planning to put economic pressure on Japan, and urged the Foreign Minister to prepare for any eventuality. He then expressed his opinion that Hitler's speech, which allowed him to say that he would be friends with Japan in wartime, suggested that it was necessary to review the position of the UK, the US and France in East Asia. Foreign Minister Arita replied that Japan's policy of establishing a new order in East Asia was based on the spirit of the "Imperial Way" and its purpose was to seek that everyone gets what they deserve. Japan does not intend to exclude the rights of third countries in the Far East, but wants to cooperate with China and "Manchukuo" to form a powerful link in the world economic chain.

<h3>Border Provocations by Japanese and Puppet Troops; Russia Again Warns Japan; Soviet Internal Affairs to Return to Normal; Elimination of Barriers Between Intellectuals, Farmers, and Workers</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Recently, Japanese and puppet troops have frequently crossed the border, leading to repeated clashes. On January 31st, a relatively serious conflict occurred near the Karasduvskaya border post. Five Soviet border patrol members were patrolling the area when they were suddenly fired upon by eighteen Japanese and puppet soldiers using rifles and machine guns. The Japanese and puppet soldiers had already crossed the border and occupied a small island belonging to the Soviet Union in the Yagon River. The Soviet patrol was forced to retaliate, and with the timely arrival of reinforcements, the Japanese and puppet soldiers were driven off the island. They carried away seven wounded soldiers as they retreated. Only one Soviet squad leader sustained minor injuries. Regarding this incident, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan has been instructed to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government, pointing out the repeated violations of the border by Japanese and puppet troops and warning the Japanese side of the possible consequences. (TASS dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the records of the House of Representatives, Minister of War Itagaki stated yesterday afternoon in response to a question from Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party) member Tashiro regarding the Soviet attitude toward Japan: "Since the Changkufeng Incident, the Soviet Union has clearly strengthened its military preparedness in the Far East to counter Japan. The Far Eastern Red Army has been reorganized into two units, and the commander of the Far Eastern Red Army, Vasily Blyukher, has been replaced. These are well-known facts. As for Changkufeng, the Soviet authorities appear to be constructing defensive fortifications east of what they call the Soviet-Manchukuo border. Illegal border crossings by Soviet soldiers along the entire Soviet-Manchukuo border have greatly increased. Generally speaking, these actions by the Soviet Union are not intentional but due to negligence, so their nature is not serious. The recent border situation is relatively peaceful." Itagaki also assured the questioner that the Japanese army has taken sufficient precautionary measures to ensure the safety of the border area, but he declined to disclose the details. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It is generally believed that the 18th Congress of the Communist Party, which will convene on March 10th, will discuss the abolition of the "Large-Scale Purge" case, a sign that Soviet internal affairs are returning to normal. The proposal stipulates that ordinary party members are permitted to publicly criticize senior party officials. Secret court trials are completely illegal and will be replaced by individual interrogations so that party members accused of violating party discipline can defend themselves. It is also reported that the struggle against capitalist elements has now been declared over, and the distinctions between workers, intellectuals, and farmers have been eliminated.

<h3>Bishop Yu Pin Leaves France for the United States; Delivers a Speech Before Departure</h3>
<p>Le Havre - Bishop Yu Pin of Nanjing, China, is traveling to the United States as a commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, and representative of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, to appeal for help for the thirty million refugees in China and to express gratitude to various public and private charitable organizations for their aid to Chinese refugees over the past two years. Before departing from Europe, he visited Pope Pius XI in Rome, who highly praised his efforts. He was also encouraged by the French Society of the Divine Word. He boarded the "Paris" liner here this afternoon to travel to New York. He plans to stay in the United States for six months before returning to China. Before his departure, he made the following remarks to a Havas news agency reporter: (Reporter asked) How much longer will the Sino-Japanese war last? (Bishop Yu replied) "Judging by Japan's strength, I am afraid it will not be able to sustain the war for more than two years. If that country wants to control China, it must occupy all of China. Merely seizing some cities will not constitute victory, because China is an agricultural country, and its main lifeline is not in the cities. As it stands now, Japan only occupies the areas where its troops are stationed; the rest is still in Chinese hands." (Asked) In your opinion, how will the Sino-Japanese war end? (Answered) "Japan will not be able to end the war by force. One day, Japan will be the first to sue for peace." (Asked) If war breaks out in Europe, will Japan, in accordance with the Anti-Comintern Pact, come to the aid of Germany and Italy? (Answered) "Japan cannot conquer China; how can it have the strength to participate in another war?" (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Britain Spare No Effort in Defence Arrangements</h3>

<h3>Palestine Conference to Open Next Week</h3>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources,</p>
<p>The conference on the Palestine issue will be personally opened by Prime Minister Chamberlain next Tuesday morning. It is reported that the Prime Minister will address each delegation separately, and then the leaders of each delegation will formally reply. At that time, the delegations will not begin substantive talks in the meeting room until two or three days after the opening. Yesterday afternoon, Colonial Secretary MacDonald met with several Jewish representatives and will meet with representatives from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq in the evening. After discussion, it is expected that the language used in the conference will be determined to be three languages for all speeches, namely English, Arabic, and one other, presumably French. It is reported that the Palestine issue itself will be discussed after the talks formally begin next week. The delegations have been entertained by various parties in recent days, feeling very fatigued and unable to cope, so they have politely declined invitations from many places for the delegation. Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Ben-Gurion, Professor Namier, Mr. Hexter, and Mr. Lorie, representatives of the Jewish organizations participating in the conference, all met with MacDonald yesterday. The Jewish representatives from Palestine must arrive in England next Tuesday, so they will not be able to have the first discussion with the Jews until next Wednesday. It is expected that MacDonald and Under-Secretary Butler will frequently attend future meetings, while Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will only attend a few times.

<h3>The Most American Aircraft Bought by France; German Newspapers Criticise Heavily</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the Department of Commerce's statistics today, France may become the largest customer of the American aircraft industry this year, as France recently ordered 100 "Curtiss" military aircraft, and the French Aviation Committee is currently negotiating with the American side to order another 600 aircraft, worth approximately $35,000,000. The Netherlands, Japan, and China were the major customers of American aircraft last year, with total exports amounting to $68,000,000. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the Department of Commerce's statistics, nearly half of the aircraft and aircraft materials manufactured in the United States in 1938 were exported abroad, with a total value of $68,000,000. Of this, 44% was shipped to countries along the Pacific coast. By country, the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies were the largest customers, accounting for the first place, with a total purchase of $11,774,043. Japan ranked second, with a total purchase of $11,061,447. China ranked third, with a total purchase of $6,391,713. The rest were Argentina, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, the Commonwealth of Australia, and British Hong Kong Island. As for the orders already received by American aircraft factories this year, European countries are the largest customers. In addition, according to the Department of Commerce's statistics on the export volume of scrap metal from the United States last year, Japan purchased a total of 1,381,901 tons, Italy purchased a total of 437,025 tons, the United Kingdom purchased a total of 309,319 tons, and Germany purchased a total of 230,903 tons. The number of purchases by Japan, Italy, and Germany all increased compared to 1937, while the United Kingdom's decreased. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the announcement by U.S. President Roosevelt in the Senate Military Committee that American aircraft companies were permitted to sell 600 of the latest American military aircraft to France for a price of $65 million, German newspapers have launched the most sharpest criticism, calling it a reckless attempt to incite a war spirit. The Völkischer Beobachter (People's Observer) pointed out that the United States, due to its terrain that is not easily attacked by foreign countries, often takes the lead in maintaining peace. Since the World War, the American people have believed that their duty is to avoid getting involved in the European vortex, and therefore passed strict neutrality laws. However, today, the American people have disregarded these laws, and the entire United States is filled with elements inciting an anti-German movement. If their plan succeeds, it will drive the farmers of Pittsburgh and the workers of the Central West to shed their blood on distant battlefields. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung (Berlin Financial Newspaper) stated in even more violent terms, "Roosevelt's remarks surprise us more than once, but we do not believe that Hitler's speech to the Reichstag was published just twenty-four hours after Roosevelt responded with such a threat of war. Hitler's speech contained words that I believed would bring a long period of peace, which was a relief to the world. Why is President Roosevelt the only one who is unhappy about this? In short, Roosevelt's answer to the world's nations' desire for peace is to move the U.S. defense line to France. From this point of view, Roosevelt seems to regret that last September's crisis did not lead to an international armed conflict. He is certainly dissatisfied with the policies pursued by Chamberlain and Daladier, each in their own way. In his intention, he must persuade Britain and France to abandon all efforts to seek understanding with Germany. It can be seen that Roosevelt fundamentally ignores the Franco-German agreement, does not understand the true meaning of Hitler's declaration, and simply tries to support the democracies and oppose the German-Italian Axis." The newspaper concluded by saying that President Roosevelt is the greatest democratic protector of Bolshevism. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The speech made by U.S. President Roosevelt yesterday to the members of the Senate Army Committee has triggered a fierce reaction here. The semi-official German News Agency (Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro) issued a message attacking President Roosevelt, stating that this speech is the most astonishing nonsense from responsible American authorities in some time. The President's intention is probably to counteract the great impression that Hitler's speech has made on the world. The Führer has strongly condemned warmongers and expressed his hope that lasting peace can be established. Does Roosevelt feel that he is among those being scolded and that his plans have been thwarted? As for the sale of 700 of the latest American aircraft to France, the intermediary was the U.S. Ambassador to France, William Bullitt, one of President Roosevelt's closest associates and a close friend of Lenin. Roosevelt, under his instigation, ordered Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., who is Jewish, to handle the matter. The Army and Navy authorities opposed it, but succumbed to pressure from the White House. Millions of decent Americans are now demanding a public investigation. This case will become an unprecedented scandal of the U.S. government. If someone else had done it instead of the President himself, it would be denounced as treason. It can be asserted that Roosevelt, having suffered repeated setbacks, wants to issue shocking remarks to divert national attention. If there is talk of the American border being in France, it is utter nonsense." In addition, all newspapers have vehemently criticized President Roosevelt, saying that he has formed an alliance with the Bolsheviks. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>People in Chongqing Worried; Approaching End of the Anti-Air Raid Weather Season</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Residents of Chongqing are becoming increasingly worried as the season of clear skies approaches, fearing Japanese air raids. Chongqing's weather in winter is mostly cloudy and foggy, with sunshine only for a few days a month. Normally, this type of weather is disliked, but the residents of Chongqing welcome it because it prevents Japanese bombers from flying over. Here, the weather in Chongqing is called "anti-air raid weather" or "anti-Japanese weather." However, winter is coming to an end, and after the Lunar New Year on February 19th, the sun will shine all day long, and the weather will be clear, which is conducive to bombing by aircraft. Therefore, the residents of Chongqing are becoming increasingly uneasy. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Restoration of the Commissioner's Office; Unification of Administration in Nine Suburban Counties of Shanghai; County Magistrate Fei Gongxia and Others Have Arrived; Establishment of a Military Commissioner for Songhu</h3>
<p>Punan Correspondence: When the Punan area fell last year, there was a period of chaos in the local area. After arduous struggles, the homeland was recovered within a few months, and order was gradually restored. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing the great importance of military and political facilities in various places, has specially restored the administrative system to its original state,</p>
<p>Establishment of the Commissioner's Office</p>
<p>The Third District Inspector Commissioner's Office and the Third District Headquarters of the Provincial Security Brigade have been established. All military and political matters in Pudongnan, as well as the counties of Chuan, Nan, Feng, Jin, and the suburban counties of Shanghai, Bao, Song, Jia, and Qing, are under the jurisdiction of the office. It has been reported to the National Government for official announcement. The county magistrates in the district have also been formally appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs, including Fei Gongxia of Songjiang, Hong Lanxiang of Baoshan, Zhou Xingbei of Shanghai, Ruan Kaiji of Fengxian, Tang Yaoyu of Chuansha, Sheng Pingzhi of Nanhui, Qian Letong of Jinshan, Ping Zuchun of Qingpu, and Teng Guobin of Jiading, all of whom arrived to take office a month ago. People's Self-Defense Corps have been organized in each county to maintain law and order, with the county magistrates serving as the corps commanders and under the control of the Provincial Security Brigade.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Various Armies</p>
<p>It is also learned from the Central Government that the existing troops in Pudongnan and the suburbs of Shanghai, who have defended the local area and made meritorious contributions, have complex organization and inconsistent names. Therefore, in order to strengthen the strength, Gu Zhutong, Commander of the Third War Area, has specially established the post of Military Commissioner for Songhu, which is concurrently held by the Inspector Commissioner of the Third Administrative District. All miscellaneous troops in various counties in the district and nearby areas are under the responsibility of the commissioner for reorganization. If the funds have not been available from local taxes, the commissioner will provide appropriate assistance. It is reported that the troops in Chuansha, Songjiang, Wusong, and other places have been formally reorganized by the commissioner into ten battalions in the near future, and they will continue to serve in their original positions. In the southeastern coastal areas, personnel have also been sent to handle the matter. In Jiading, it is estimated that one division of troops will be reorganized, with sufficient weapons. Therefore, the Commander of the Third War Area has approved the formal formation of the division and assigned it to a certain regiment of the Third War Area for command. As for the three branches of the Loyal and Patriotic Army stationed in Feng, Nan, and Chuan counties, they were originally under the control of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee and were of the nature of the National Defense Forces and not within the military scope of the commissioner.</p>
<p>Joint Defense of Five Counties</p>
<p>Recently, the troops of Feng, Nan, Chuan, Jin, and Song counties in Pudongnan have organized the Joint Defense Headquarters of Five Counties, mutually recommending Ding Xisan, commander of the Eighth Branch of the Loyal and Patriotic Army, as the commander-in-chief, and Qian Letong, head of the Jinshan County People's Self-Defense Corps, as the deputy commander, also serving as the Songhu Commissioner. Recently, Yu Taosheng, Ma Bosheng, and other key personnel of the Loyal and Patriotic Army in various counties have been hired as councilors of the office. On the one hand, Ding Xisan also serves as the deputy commander of the Third District People's Self-Defense Corps. Before the self-defense corps in Feng, Nan, and Chuan counties are formally established, local security has been discussed and assisted by the Loyal and Patriotic Army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Qingpu Kill Each Other; Burned Nine Towns and Villages in Revenge</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Qingpu, seeing that the guerrilla forces of Wei's unit outside the North Gate of Zhangyan Town were growing stronger, wanted to attack, but because their strength was insufficient, they did not advance. They then colluded with the Japanese troops stationed in Xujing and Huangdu to encircle and attack. On the 28th of last month, more than 20 Japanese troops in Qingpu disguised themselves as farmers and first went to the town to scout. Then, 70 or 80 Japanese troops and two platoons of pseudo-police were sent in eight speedboats to provide support. However, the disguised Japanese troops were mistaken for guerrillas by the Japanese troops in Huangdu and Xujing, who opened fire on them. The supporting troops in Qingpu, without careful observation, also believed that the advance party was attacked by guerrillas and swept the two Japanese forces in Huangdu and Xujing with machine guns. When the two sides were engaged in a fierce battle, the guerrillas realized what was happening and ordered an encirclement and attack. The Japanese troops committed suicide and were attacked from both sides, resulting in 150 or 160 casualties. The surviving Japanese troops returned to report to the special task force leader, Matsuoka. Matsuoka, in a fit of rage, again colluded with the Japanese troops in Huangdu, Xujing, Fangjiayao, and Beiganshan, preparing for a large-scale encirclement and attack. At 9 a.m. one day, Matsuoka personally led the Japanese and puppet troops from Qingpu to advance, but the guerrillas had heard about it in advance. In order to avoid wasting their strength, they had already left. When the Japanese troops encircled and attacked, they found nothing and could not find anything even after a thorough search. They vented their anger on the people and burned nine towns and villages, including Chonggu, Zhangyan, Old Qingpu, Shixianggong Temple, Yuantuanjing, Yujing, Qinglong Town, Hao'ao'an, and Xiwang Temple.</p>

<h3>The Second Year of the War of Resistance: Production and Sales of Sichuan Province Commodities (1) (Continued): Reduced Imports Due to Difficult Transportation; Worry of Stagnation in Local Product Sales Still Exists</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the purchase of medicinal herbs by a certain influential figure, several medicinal materials, such as aconite, codonopsis, chuanxiong, angelica, rhubarb, and white peony root, have become extremely active in the market. At the same time, the Pharmaceutical Association is also preparing to organize a medicinal materials trading company, raising 200,000 yuan to carry out planned export trade. The Sichuan branch of the Southwest Industrial Association has also raised 200,000 yuan to set up a medicinal product refining company, intending to use scientific methods to refine Chinese medicine to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. The fifth most important product is sheepskin. In previous years, the export volume has always been two to three million pieces. Last year, due to various reasons, sheepskin companies did not provide advance loans for purchase, resulting in a smaller output, only over one million pieces in total. Only one million pieces were traded and shipped out, with a total value of about two to three million yuan. After the Yangtze River traffic was reduced, the value of goods transported and sold was only slightly more than one-third of the original. As for sheep wool, after the Yangtze River steamers shortened their routes, monthly sales were only slightly more than one percent of the original. The sales volume last year was too small to mention. However, from another perspective, Sichuan Province has a large backlog of sheep wool, which may not be a bad "business opportunity" for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Local Products for Transshipment: There are two types: Sichuan salt and Sichuan opium. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the Huai salt production areas have become war zones. The salt supply for the four provinces along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and part of Henan Province has relied on Sichuan salt. Therefore, Sichuan salt exports were extremely smooth last year. Subsequently, due to the capture of many export markets, and the insufficient sales of internal sales, which include both banks of the Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, all efforts were made to use the accumulated export salt for internal sales. Therefore, the Sichuan Salt Affairs Bureau only increased production in the Fu and Rong factories. It is estimated that over 1,000 loads were transported out through the five autumn customs for export, and the approved sales quota for internal sales was 1,770 loads for the five, autumn, and year customs combined. The average price of flower salt was 12,000 yuan per load, and the average price of Ba salt was 13,000 yuan per load. In total, the total business volume of Sichuan salt merchants last year was over 30 million yuan. Retail prices on each bank varied slightly due to distance and transportation costs. Wholesale sales are subject to government-approved price restrictions from the production area to transportation, so salt merchants cannot obtain as much profit as general merchants. This is the production and sales situation of Sichuan salt last year. As for Sichuan opium, the total business volume last year was over 3.7 million yuan. Although it is not a legitimate business, it still has its commercial value before it is completely banned, and it is actually a leader. The production area was limited to Fuling, Yihan, and Fengdu counties in the previous year, with a total output of 14,500 to 14,600 dan. Sales are also divided into internal and external sales. Internal sales are as high as 500 dan. Including smuggled opium, it is said that the actual number could be doubled. Before the fall of Hankou, external sales were 800 dan per month, but now it is very different from the past. The price of opium was only one yuan per tael when it first entered the market in the early years. After drying, adding labor and interest, the highest price was only one yuan and fifty or sixty cents. However, by July last year, it gradually rose to more than 3,000 yuan or even 4,000 yuan. Although the price of both new and old opium has fallen recently, less than 3,000 yuan per dan, due to the government's early ban on planting and increased tobacco taxes, there is still an upward trend. According to investigations, there are currently about 10,000 dan of new opium in Peiling, Yihan, Fengdu, and Dianjiang. Opium merchants who are not too bad at business can all make a profit. This is the production and sales situation of Sichuan opium last year.</p>
<p>Imported Goods: Among Chongqing's imports, cotton yarn has always ranked first. In 1936, the total import of cotton yarn reached more than 95,700 bales. In 1937, due to the war, it decreased to more than 88,100 bales, with a value of more than 22 million yuan. Last year, the total import volume to Chongqing was only over 43,000 bales (with another 5,000 bales temporarily stored in Yichang), but the price was twice as high as before the war. In January 1937, the price of a bale of 20-count Cailian was 308 yuan. Last year, the highest price of the same count of Lao Shiqiu rose to 910 yuan. The current market price is around 830 yuan (flower clothes and coarse flannel are priced at 105 yuan per dan, while fine flannel is only 95 yuan per dan. It is said that it is only 30 or 40 yuan per dan in Yichang). Due to the fluctuating price of yarn, more than 20 brokerage firms suddenly appeared last year to speculate in futures. The Agricultural Bank specifically established a yarn shop named Fushengzhuang to stabilize yarn prices. Now, except for Fushengzhuang, all yarn shops lack inventory, and there is a situation of supply falling short of demand. There are four cotton yarn mills relocated to Sichuan: Yuhua, Yufeng, Dacheng, and Qingxin (part of the Shenxin No. 4 Mill relocated to Chongqing). In addition, the Ministry of Military Affairs newly established a yarn mill, with a total of 100,000 spindles. However, they are currently under construction and preparation. Except for Qingxin, which has started the steel wire car, the other factories have not yet started work. Among them, Yuhua has the largest amount of goods and the best business. In addition to cotton yarn, the most important is cloth. In the previous year, the total import volume was more than 28,000 dan. The source of goods has always been mainly from foreign-owned factories or Sino-foreign joint ventures in Shanghai. Last year, the total import volume was only over 6,000 pieces, among which various colors of blue cloth, ha cloth, imitation serge, and imitation straight tribute cloth accounted for the majority. The price of goods is mostly more than doubled compared to before the war. (To be continued)</p>

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Xinmin Middle School</h3>
<p>Xinmin Middle School was founded in the spring of 1927. It has been in operation for twelve years. It was approved by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and filed with the Ministry of Education in 1930. The school site has always been at the end of Xinshi Road, Jiangwan, covering an area of more than 20 mu. The dining hall is spacious, and the equipment is complete. There are three to four hundred students, most of whom live on campus, so management is convenient, and the school spirit is extremely strict. The school has both high school and junior high school departments. The high school is divided into general and business departments. Each grade only accepts boys and does not recruit girls. The January 28th Shanghai War broke out, Jiangwan became a war zone, the school buildings were destroyed, and the school equipment was lost, causing the achievements of years of struggle to be destroyed in one fell swoop. After efforts to revive the school, it was decided to restore the old appearance. Now the August 13th War broke out again, and the school was burned down again. However, the organizers of the school still take Mingde Xinmin as their responsibility and continue to work hard and become more energetic. In the fourth quarter of 1937, they borrowed 30 Huangjiasha Huayuan on Kader Road as a temporary school building, rushed to build it, and started school on time. Therefore, although the school has suffered a catastrophe, the singing has not stopped. The class time is in accordance with the old regulations, with full-day classes. The teachers in the school are graduates of famous universities from all over the country, with rich knowledge and serious teaching. Most of them have more than ten years of teaching experience. The students work hard, are courteous and obedient, and are tireless in academic research. In the last semester, they continued to publish the school magazine, publishing the academic works of each student and compiling them into a huge volume. Recently, the number of students in the school has increased sharply, and the school buildings are no longer sufficient. Therefore, the expansion plan is already being drafted, and it will be possible to promote its realization one by one in the near future.</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Ends in Change: Mixed Team Loses to Mailing by Three Points, 25 to 28; Girls' Performance, Isolated Island Wins</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western charity basketball game sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the mixed team played the second final against Mailing last night, still held in the China Youth Basketball Hall. The mixed team took the lead all the way, leading by two points in the first half, 13 to 11. Unexpectedly, in the last nine minutes, Chen Xianglong was fouled out four times. Due to miscalculation in the scheduling, the situation changed drastically, and Mailing suddenly rushed in five points. Although the lineup was changed again, it was finally helpless. Mailing came from behind and reversed the victory by three points, 28 to 25. Now Mailing and the mixed team have each won one game. The final final game will be held at the same place at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow night. Last night, Mailing was determined to win and went all out. The entire game was fought by Mailing's red team. The performance was much better than last time, so the game was unusually fierce from beginning to end, and was always in an extremely tense atmosphere. The performance cooperation of the mixed team was also better than the previous game. It can be said that Sun Huipei was the most outstanding. It is difficult to say who will win tomorrow night's third game. There was also a girls' performance game before the game last night. Using men's rules, the isolated island defeated the West League by 30 to 15 points. Chen Zaichun and Rong Mozhen were unusually brave, scoring a lot of points. The audience last night was more crowded than the previous game, with a total of seven or eight hundred people. The refugees benefited a lot.</p>
<p>Taking the Lead All the Way: After the girls' game, the mixed and Mailing teams followed. The mixed team responded with two Chens (Xianglong Xuechong), Cai Yanxiong, Sun Huipei, and Li Zhenzhong. Mailing responded with a pure red team. As soon as it circled, Chen Xuechong got the pass from Xianglong and had already jumped into the basket, and cheers rang out, setting a record. But Xianglong fouled, and Brain also got one point. Li Zhenzhong passed beautifully, and Xianglong reversed and lifted it up, which was extremely beautiful. The mixed team immediately took a 4-1 lead. So Pierce hit the basket in the air and chased it to three against four. Permand shot from the corner and hit, and Wilder continued to hit. Xuechong blocked people under the basket and won three points in one breath, becoming eight to four, and was taken the lead instead. At this time, the mixed team quickly replaced Li Zhenzhong with Zhou Dayun. Zhou scored as soon as he came on the field, and Xianglong returned and lifted it in, chasing it to eight each. Mailing transferred Muliang and transferred Pierce. Li Zhenzhong also came on the field again to replace Xianglong, and his morale was greatly boosted. Brown fouled, Zhou Dayun penalized one point, and Sun Huipei returned and entered the basket with one hand. Dayun waved his left hand and broke the enemy's basket, 13 to 9, and the mixed team took a four-point lead. In the first half of the break, Wilder jumped up and threw it in. The first half ended, and the mixed team led by two points with a score of 13 to 11.</p>
<p>Golden Age: Switching baskets and fighting again, the personnel on both sides did not change much, and the situation of the battle was still controlled by the mixed team. Less than a minute after the start of the game, Chen Xuechong used his quick and lightning-fast old technique to enter the basket with one hand. Moore also returned the color, and Sun Huipei entered the bottom of the basket, making a contribution and returning, becoming 17 to 13, and the mixed team took the lead. At 19 to 16, the mixed team called a timeout and transferred Li Zhenzhong to supplement Xianglong. As expected, Sun Huipei scored in one fell swoop. Although Mailing played with Maituojie and others, they still could not have a good performance. Sun Huipei was like a lively dragon and fierce tiger, making two penalties and scoring both. Cai Yanxiong shot from a distance and advanced smoothly, 23 to 16, and the mixed team took a lead of seven points. It was indeed the golden age of the mixed team in yesterday's game. But an unexpected disaster came, and Xianglong appeared for the fourth time. Lu Zhongen, a resourceful man, was transferred up, and then the doom came.</p>
<p>Dramatic Change in the Situation: The situation suddenly changed drastically, and Mailing even scored five points in a row in the chaos. Brown scored a penalty, Saqin's free shot also hit, Maituojie scored a penalty, plus another throw, 22 to 23, the difference was only one point, and the situation was extremely tense. At this time, the mixed team urgently transferred Li Zude to replace Lu Zhongen, and made a mistake again and again, losing everything. Although Sun Huipei scored two penalties, in an instant, Brown chased to 24 to 25, and Moore lifted it up, and the Mailing team finally raised its head and won one point instead. There were still two and a half minutes left at the time. Although the mixed team shouted a timeout, the players' psychology had already been affected. Pierce shot from the bottom corner, 28 to 25, and the Mailing team established a winning situation. In the end, Li Zhenzhong and Zhou Dasha's two long shots were both a hair's breadth away, 28 to 25, and a good winning situation fell into the hands of others.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>Finance: European Situation Relaxes, Gold Price Increase Resumes. Tianjin and Hong Kong Groups Compete to Purchase, High of 2037 Yuan.</p>
<p>The spot gold market experienced a sudden expansion in price increases yesterday. Since the European situation has relaxed, people's confidence has generally improved. In addition, the foreign exchange rate continues to tighten due to the collusion of North China United Bank and foreign banks. As a result, the wealthy in this city have become more eager to purchase and hoard gold. Moreover, the Tianjin group entrusted a certain money exchange firm to aggressively purchase gold, and the Hong Kong group secretly continued their activities. Fortunately, the gold shops and silver shops supplied gold in the morning, so the price increase was relatively slow. In the afternoon, a giant in the securities group also came to follow and search for gold. Although the silver shops and money exchange firms continued to sell, the supply was still insufficient to meet the demand. Furthermore, buyers were willing to pay high prices and compete to purchase, which led to a sharp increase in prices, reaching a daily high of 2,037 yuan at closing. As a result, confidence in all quarters was greatly increased, and trading was also active. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops also increased twice, and customs gold bars and Sino-British pure gold also rebounded and increased in price.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Increases by Fifteen Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial price quoted by sellers was 2,024 yuan per tael (ten liang). Buyers bid 2,021 yuan. Both sides negotiated until after 10:00 AM, when buyers became more eager to purchase due to rumors that the foreign exchange rate had softened after being manipulated by the North China United Bank and foreign banks. Initially, a certain money exchange firm purchased 50 taels from a gold shop and a silver shop purchased 100 taels, with a starting price of 2,024 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop purchased another 50 taels at 2,025 yuan, and a silver shop purchased 50 taels at 2,024 yuan (reportedly, all of the above purchases were made on behalf of the Tianjin and Hong Kong groups). Shortly after, a silver shop, also acting on behalf of the Hong Kong group, purchased 50 taels each from a fellow silver shop and a gold shop at the same price. Later, the silver shop purchased another 50 taels from a fellow silver shop at 2,025 yuan. The same price was seen when a money exchange firm purchased 10 taels each from a fellow money exchange and a gold shop. Later, a certain money exchange firm purchased 90 taels from a gold shop at 2,027 yuan. By this time it was already past 11:00 AM. Thereafter, the supply became scarce, and although buyers continued to bid 2,027 yuan, no sellers were willing to supply. Therefore, it was difficult to make a deal until noon, and the noon closing price was 2,027 yuan. At 2:10 PM in the afternoon, a money exchange firm purchased 50 taels from the North Group at 2,028 yuan, and another 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,028.5 yuan. Thereafter, the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten due to manipulation by foreign banks, which further intensified the buying in the market. Most sellers were hesitant to sell, so the price jumped to over 2,030 yuan. A certain money exchange firm purchased another 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,032 yuan, and another 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,033 yuan. At that time, the North Group suddenly came to purchase again, which further sharpened the price increase. The North Group purchased 50 taels from a gold shop for 2,037 yuan. Subsequently, money exchange firms slightly sold at high prices, and then slightly retreated. Money exchange firms mutually traded 20 taels at 2,036 yuan, and another 50 taels at 2,035 yuan. Later, a securities group suddenly became interested in buying, so the price repeatedly increased. A securities group purchased 50 taels from a silver shop at 2,035 yuan, and another 20 taels from a money exchange firm at 2,037 yuan, and then another 50 taels from a money exchange firm at 2,037 yuan. Later, they still wanted to purchase more, but they couldn't find a counterparty, so a deal couldn't be made. Therefore, the evening closing price was still 2,037 yuan, which was 15 yuan higher than yesterday's. The selling price of gold from cash shops was 2,045 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,030 yuan. The spot gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no deals were made.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Changed to More Expensive Twice</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops was not changed at first. However, at 11:00 AM, due to the strong stability of spot gold, the price was increased by one yuan. Later, at 4:25 PM, due to the sudden increase of spot gold to near 2,040 yuan, the price was increased by another yuan. Datonghang Laokingyun and other stores changed the selling price to 207 yuan, new stores changed the selling price to 205 yuan, and the purchase price was 199 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Fluctuated Suddenly</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, the price of British pure gold suddenly rebounded by one and a half pence per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, and 7.5 pence. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also rebounded to 1,213.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price also increased by three cents, which is 2.397 yuan. The Shanghai spot gold price also rebounded by one yuan, amounting to 1,208.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>"United Bank" Resumes Absorption. Foreign Exchange Rate Tightens Briefly. Later, Due to Foreign Telegram Sales, the Situation Slightly Improved.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was quite tight due to the absorption by a certain broker on behalf of the Preparatory Bank of North China and the fierce competition among major foreign banks. The British gold rate once retreated to 8 pence and 2.96875. The US dollar rate also softened to 16.125 yuan. However, the result was not severely tight because the foreign telegrams and the Chinese banks competed to sell. There were many fluctuations and active transactions. Although the Hong Kong exchange rate still had a strong appetite for banks, the money exchange firms were still willing to supply, so there was no significant difference.</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, the London telegraph rate narrowed in near and far terms. The New York silver price remained flat. The London gold price increased by one and a half pence. The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar was 0.06, and the exchange rate with France and Shanghai remained unchanged. The US dollar rate increased by 0.0625 against the pound, decreased by 0.0625 against France, and remained flat against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's early opening, the selling price of the British exchange rate was 8 pence and 3.328125, and the selling price of the US dollar was 16.21875 yuan, both unchanged compared to the previous closing price. After the opening, the North China United Bank strongly purchased foreign banks' US dollars at 16.21875 yuan and British gold at 8 pence and 3.3125. Therefore, the situation gradually tightened. The HSBC listing was announced unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly half a cent. After that, foreign banks, including Dutch Bank, American Bank, and HSBC, purchased British gold at 8 pence and 3.328125 and US dollars at 16.1875. As a result, the process softened. Near noon, a money exchange firm suddenly sold US dollar bills at 16.375 yuan to China-Italy Bank and Dutch Bank, and also sold Hong Kong exchange at 56.125 yuan to China-America and Anda Banks. As a result, the situation began to turn loose. The noon closing price of the bank was 8 pence and 3.3125 for British exchange and the same as the morning opening price of 16.21875 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, the American Bank and foreign banks competed to purchase foreign telegrams and Chinese banks' British gold at 8 pence and 3.3125 and US dollars at 16.1875. Later, the British gold rate was softened to over 8 pence and 2.96875, and the US dollar rate was tightened to over 16.125 yuan. Therefore, the situation became tighter. Later, foreign telegrams and Chinese banks jointly competed to sell British gold at 8 pence and 3.3125 and US dollars at 16.1875. In addition, foreign banks' settlement of accounts decreased, which loosened the situation. Only Dutch Bank purchased 56 yuan of Hong Kong exchange from money exchange firms, which slightly softened the situation. By the evening closing price, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 3.3125 for British exchange and 16.1875 yuan for US dollars. As a result, the British exchange rate was reduced by 0.015625 and the US exchange rate was tightened by 0.03125 compared to the previous closing price. The Hong Kong exchange rate did not change.</p>
<p>Strong Demand for British and American Gold Notes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British pure gold rebounded by one and a half pence, and the British and American exchange rates rebounded by 0.0625. Foreign banks' settlement of foreign exchange was very active, but the banks' supply was not smooth. The market price gradually increased and the trend was weak. Hong Kong groups were very active in absorbing spot gold, and the wealthy were very interested in buying, but few people were willing to sell their profits, so there was a shortage of chips. The market price increased sharply and the closing price was firm. It is expected that the future of spot gold will continue to be high. The wealthy were very active in searching for foreign currencies, and the demand for British and American gold notes was strong. There was also strong demand for Dutch notes. The supply of various currencies was not smooth, and the market price increased. The association's transactions were still active. Ding Yuan sold Hong Kong notes to Changtai for 700 yuan. Qintai sold Dutch notes to Baocheng for 100 yuan. Yingfeng sold British gold notes to Hongchang for £50. Yikang sold Dutch notes to Baocheng for 100 yuan. Yesterday's market price increased by one dime for British gold pounds, increased by eight cents for British gold notes, increased by one dime for American gold pounds, increased by 1.4 cents for American gold notes, increased by one cent for Hong Kong notes, increased by half a cent for French franc notes, increased by one cent for Singapore notes, increased by five cents for Dutch notes, increased by three cents for Annam notes, increased by two cents for Robbie notes, and increased by two cents for Philippine notes. Only Canadian notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes did not change.</p>
<p>Telegraph Transfer Declined for Three Consecutive Days</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, speculators sold more than they bought, the market was still flat, and the closing price was still flat. Buyers paid the listed price, and sellers were willing to supply only if the price was 0.0625 higher. The near and far term telegraph transfer rate narrowed by 0.0625. According to the New York silver telegram, the American silver price remained unchanged. Also, Indian silver was closed and there was no market.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Dropped Slightly by Half a Corner</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for draft bills slightly decreased. The daily rate was still fluctuating between 36 and 37 yuan per thousand yuan. The lowest rate in the morning was 36.25 yuan, and the rate in the afternoon was 36.5 yuan, which was half a yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Unified Class A Drawing as Scheduled, Bond Market Like the Sun Emerging from Clouds, All Prices Rebounded</h3>
<p>The securities gray market situation yesterday was very active, and the rebound continued strongly. The sluggish and gloomy atmosphere of the past two weeks suddenly became clear, because after the recent announcement of interest payments, and as the Class A drawing approached, there were no other changes. Yesterday, the Fund Custody Committee also announced that it had received an order from the Ministry to hold the Class A drawing as scheduled. The rumors of the short sellers suddenly became ineffective. This newspaper has also repeatedly stated that these rumors were nothing more than baseless fabrications. However, due to the empty sentiment and continuous price declines, there was no factual proof. Now that the Ministry's order has been issued, it is like the sun emerging from the clouds and all the shadows disappearing. However, the market price has fallen for a long time, and the interest rate has already decreased by 13 or 14 yuan compared to the high price, which is enough to attract general investment. It is also a fact that it is most cost-effective for general retail investors to replenish what they had previously sold. Therefore, even if there are no huge price increases in the future, at least it can be stabilized after the end of this decline.</p>
<p>Yesterday's process: the opening of Class E felt lifeless. In the middle of the day, a certain bank suddenly bought a large amount, which was handled by Zhang, and the market situation suddenly turned high. In addition, the 15th and 35th also rushed to buy, and the rising trend became stronger. The selling atmosphere was weak, and the 10th still sold at high prices, and Tongkang also sold some, but the supply and demand were very different. The situation in the afternoon was still very firm, and a certain bank continued to buy, and the majority of retail investors were also interested, and the atmosphere seemed to be very good. It rose by three corners again, and the results all continued to rise, ranging from six and a half corners to one and a half yuan. Among them, Class D rose more because it had not been done the previous day. The total turnover was nearly one million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading has become quiet again. Most of the sellers in the market are scarce, and it is not easy for buyers to find opponents, so most of them are still in solicitation.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock transaction, the number of shares of China Bookstore shares was 10 shares, and the character "ten" was mistakenly printed as "thousand", which is now corrected.</p>
<p>The London China Foreign Debt Principal and Interest List on the 1st (Wednesday), the prices of all debts have not changed, and the trend seems to have become stable. As for the supply of real goods, only the railway bonds have a little decoration. The Hukwang Railway Bonds, whether they are printed debt tickets or printed winning tickets, each 2,000 pounds, the selling prices are both 22 pounds and 5 shillings, which is slightly higher than the market price by five shillings. The original Tsienpu Railway Bonds, whether they are German-issued debt tickets or German-issued winning debt tickets, each 1,000 pounds, and the continued issuance of bonds, German-issued printed debt tickets, 3,000 pounds, all sold for 16 pounds and a half, which is half a pound higher than the market price. Also, the Marconi Wireless Bonds, 1,500 pounds, the selling price is 12 pounds and a half, and the buying price is 12 pounds.</p>
<p>The London English Merchants' Far East Companies Stocks Market List on the 1st of this month (Wednesday), the HSBC Bank shares continued to rise, including the English Registered shares rising by half a pound, the price being 84 pounds, and the Hong Kong registered shares rising by one pound, the price being 86 and a half pounds, and the rest have not changed.</p>
<p>Shanghai Loan Investment Co., a British merchant at No. 1 Bund in this city, convened a board meeting on the 1st of this month to discuss the profit distribution plan for last year. The company's profit last year was 259,282.34 yuan in national currency, excluding the transfer of 80,000 yuan in national currency for investment depreciation reserve, and excluding the donation of 300 yuan in national currency to the British Defense Forces stationed in China, a dividend of 5.5 cents per share in national currency was distributed, totaling 137,500 yuan in national currency, and the remaining 41,482.34 yuan in national currency was rolled into the next term. After it is submitted to the shareholders' meeting to be held on the 17th of this month, it can be opened and distributed on a regular basis. The par value of each share of the company is five taels of standard silver dollars, and the current market price is about 6.23 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Speculators Are Still Pulling in on Dips, While Japanese Yarn Is Falling Step by Step</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, and the actual demand is still clear. As the end of the year is approaching, the various groups have no intention of collecting and purchasing, so the actual digestion is normal. General speculators have a strong intention to accumulate and逢 low prices, they still come to absorb, so most of the spot goods in the market are bought by them, and the spot chips are instead felt to be short. In fact, most of them have advanced funds to the warehouse. It is expected that there is a prospect of soaring in the coming spring, and of course they will close and not release now, and their attitude is as stable as a rock.</p>
<p>The situation in the current yarn market today. Those who are concerned about the early morning opening are still gathered as usual, but the visiting customers have no great appetite, so it was not until after 10:00 that it opened. The market price opened at 2 yuan, and 20-count Double Horse spot goods were 394 yuan. Only 5 bales were traded among peers, and the warehouse order price was 390 yuan. After a while, the price was slightly released at a high price, and then slightly dropped by 1 yuan, but the speculators and Yu Rongjie still came to eat in, but the amount was not as large as before. The closing price was high, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 394.5 yuan. According to the morning transaction statistics, 685 bales were traded, and the transactions among peers accounted for more than two-thirds, and the actual sales were only 140 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse was 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day, Double Earth was 1.5 yuan higher, Lao Jincheng was 3 yuan higher, Baxian was 8 yuan higher, and Flying Tiger was 2 yuan higher. The factory did not take any action. 350 pieces of export cotton yarn were transported to Shantou, 95 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, 85 pieces were transported to Guangzhou Bay, and 200 pieces were transported to Haiphong. 65 pieces of imported North Sand came. The amount of each group's purchase is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is increasingly declining, because the actual demand is not strong, and no one enters or exits the football trading, and the market situation is temporarily suspended. The football trading of last month, after mediation, has obtained a considerable method, and there is no problem. Therefore, the market is gradually declining, and the bearish trend is very strong. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue is 321 yuan to 20 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng is 318 yuan to 16 yuan, which is 3 to 4 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of Procurement: Domestic and Foreign Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, because the factory is waiting for the development of Washington news, has suspended procurement for many days. Yesterday there were more transactions, so the market price rose sharply by 4 to 5 pound sounds. India was closed yesterday, and it is predicted to fall by half a Robbie. Egypt rose by 30 pound sounds yesterday. Yesterday's exchange rate was weaker, and the converted legal tender cotton price, calculated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 7 corners per load, and Egyptian cotton was fierce.</p>
<h3>Grain: Lack of Flour Base, Wheat Price Tight</h3>
<p>Recently, the factories have gradually reduced their raw material preparations for the flour market. The foreign wheat orders have been postponed again and again. The domestic wheat price is high and there is no large amount. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and the number of flour production is not much. There is a lack of existing base, and the supply is felt to be insufficient. The sporadic consumption by visiting customers is still not weakening, and the market is secretly tight. The unified market sold more than 20,000 bags of No. 2 flour, and the price was still 4 yuan and 8 corners. The North-South and local street wholesale each took one-third. There are still 10,000 bags of No. 5 white bags, which were handled by the Beiyang group, and the price was Tianyuan triangular cloud. Yesterday, 17,700 bags of flour were exported to Shantou.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market remained firm, and the source from the Yangtze River was still sparse. The cargo owners were all waiting for a good price to sell, and they did not want to compromise. The factories had no intention of lowering prices to buy because the foreign wheat orders would arrive soon. The market did not break away from the state of tension. The number of transactions in the unified market increased slightly compared to before. A total of 3,000 bags of Jiangbei and Wuhu wheat were traded, of which 1,000 bags were handled by the Fufeng factory and 2,000 bags were handled by the Fuxin factory. The highest price of Jiangbei wheat was still 6 yuan, 5 corners and 5 cents, and the price of Wuhu yellow skin wheat was 6 yuan, 2 corners and 5 cents to 6 yuan. The market was tight.</p>
<h3>Dumi's Future Market Suffers Twice, and the Price of Visiting Customers' Indica Rice Has No Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The source of domestic rice is still sparse, and the goods from the river have not yet arrived at the port. There are only more than 2,000 bags of wheelbarrow rice, so there is still some surplus at the early market opening. The sellers' shouts are quite high, and the sales market in this street is still active. The speculators' handling is still small. The early market sentiment is quite good, but the evening market suddenly turns lax, resulting in a market setback. The results are only showing a fixed situation. There is not much entry or exit for thick and thin japonica rice. Du Yangjian and Bukit Jian still maintain the original market. Although the source of Bian Yuan goods is limited, the sales route is not as strong as the previous days, and the price is also lacking in轩轾.</p>
<p>The situation of visiting customers' indica rice: because there was a slight turning point the previous day, there were scattered small households seeking to leave the market with the market, and the source of wheel source is still continuous, and the market is resuming. However, large households and hawkers are still unwilling to sell at low prices, and small households who are anxious to sell are also unwilling to sell at a loss. Therefore, there is a slight pinning situation in the fatigue. The unified market transaction is about 1,000 bags, and the market price is not much different from the previous market, with a rise of more than 2 yuan and 7 corners, and a fall of 1 corner in Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading is gradually entering a quiet state. There were no transactions yesterday, because the end of the year is approaching, and the sales of yarn and cloth are scarce. The prices of yesterday are listed separately below.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large cotton store in this city received a telegram from the New York headquarters on the 1st, stating that the government's agricultural legislation may be difficult to promulgate and implement in the recent one or two months. There is a small demand for American cotton in all countries, but domestic sales have surged, and the consumption amount in the previous month was 600,000 bales.</p>
<p>The cotton business is completely in a state of stagnation. All parties are preparing to end the year and celebrate the New Year. This year, all industries have been prosperous and wealthy, so the market closure is earlier than in previous years. The market price is slightly sluggish due to the cooling demand, but the source is still blocked, and the existing base is not thick. The arrival of goods from the Subei side is becoming rare and thin. There are 704 bales of general cotton arriving at the dock, 30 pieces arriving from Niantuo Port, and 150 pieces are exported to Hong Kong, and 60 pieces are exported to Haikou. The spot cotton transaction record is left below.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yunnan Groups Handle Domestic Cloth More Vigorously, and Eastern Piece Goods Are Wary of Selling Short</h3>
<p>The sales of domestic cloth to visiting customers are mostly weak, but the factories have received huge orders, and there is no surplus for the month. The goods in the hands of peers and speculators are also unwilling to sell cheaply, but the spot goods of retail investors are slightly cheaper, showing a state of outer relaxation and inner tightness. The selling prices of various goods on the market are stable. The prices of goods with thin inventories, such as underwear and Hengfeng Factory's 84 original cloth, have increased by another corner. The price of Tianjin Hengyuan Factory's artillery car fine twill has increased by 2 corners due to the exhaustion of stocks in Shanghai. The sales to visiting customers are more vigorous in Yunnan, and nearly 200 boxes of bleached and dyed cloths and 50 bales of coarse cloth 84 original cloth have been traded. The Yong groups have purchased more than 130 bales of coarse cloth and fine twill from Yihua, Dasheng, Shenxin, and Hengyuan factories. This street has purchased nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth from Yihua and Hua factory's 9-pound coarse cloth. The Wenzhou group has also handled 50 pieces of blue cloth, color twill, coarse cloth, etc. The Quanzhou and Shantou groups have handled more than 80 pieces of color cloth, tick cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse cloth.</p>
<p>The actual sales of eastern cloth continue to be weak, and the decline of fine cloth and fine twill spot goods has not stopped. Because the peers are selling their hands easily, the price of each piece of fine cloth has dropped by another corner. The fine twill is relatively tougher. Although there are sporadic small amounts, they are also cut out, and the route of dyeing blanks in this street is still acceptable, so the bulls' shouts are still unmoved. The market has been less productive since the blow from Qichanghao's liquidation, and it is far from what it used to be. Those who buy short and sell short are wary, and the number of transactions is extremely small. Yesterday, the foreign companies still did not open any goods, but the dyeing factories in this street, which have a strong appetite, handled 500 to 600 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands, which made the selling price in the future market stronger again.</p>
<p>Today's piece goods exports include 230 pieces to Shantou, 3 pieces to Hong Kong, 90 pieces to Haimen, and 280 pieces to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Western Suits and Woolen Fabric Sales Market Is Still Prosperous, and the Standard Market Price Rose Sharply Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the transaction of woolen fabrics was only healthy for the western clothing industry, and there were few other transactions. Yesterday, there were also many transactions of horse tails, printed western cloth, French shirts, etc. The standard market price suddenly rose sharply again, because there are more people inside and outside the industry collecting and receiving now than in previous years, and the stock of foreign company numbers is extremely short, and the foreign exchange rate has tightened, and the pricing of Yihua Factory and Shen Textile Products has suddenly become more expensive. Therefore, although the sales to visiting customers are rare, the standard market price suddenly sees a rise. Yesterday, the price of 55 medium-thick serge has risen by 8 and a half yuan, the price of battleship serge is 5 yuan and 8 and a half corners, Rongkang's boiled water US sale is 8 and a half yuan, and the tax-free goods of 559 yuan's direct tribute have risen sharply by 5 and a half corners (the previous lowest price was 3 yuan and 8 corners).</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Bean Cake Transactions Have Lost Interest, and a Batch of Nanyang Handled Raw Oil</h3>
<p>The oil cake market and sales have lost interest, and the market situation has little ups and downs. Bean cakes are sold because the factories are taking into account the frequent rise in bean prices, and most of them are unwilling to sell cheaply, and the sales are weak because the end of the year is approaching. Therefore, the Shantou group has already been bound, and only Xiamen is still inquiring, but it is only a matter of rushing to load the ship. Yesterday, the market did not hear of any sales, and the route of bean oil continued to decrease, and the market price was also fresh. Yesterday, the paper traded 30 barrels of current Da Su oil, the price opened at the original market of 28 yuan, 1 corner and a half, and ordered 100 barrels for delivery in 7 days, the price was 28 yuan, 1 corner. There were other peer-to-peer sales and purchases, and 50 barrels were ordered for shipment in the first half of March, the price was 28 yuan and 3 and a half corners. There are more than two peanut oils arriving, and the market has declined. Yesterday, a batch of canned oil was handled by the Nanyang group, and 500 cans of Qingdao canned raw oil were sold at 29 yuan and 9 corners, 400 cans of Qingkou canned raw oil were sold at 30 yuan and 2 corners, and 150 cans of Yantai canned raw oil were also sold at 30 yuan and 2 corners.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Transactions Are Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was still weak, and the association's quotation was extremely deserted. The existing goods of 24 Dutch crude white outer warehouse were quoted at 24 yuan, 24 yuan and 2 corners for this warehouse, and 24 yuan and 4 corners for Dakin coarse, with few buyers. The existing goods of Taikoo Sugar B Mike East Warehouse were 23 yuan and 5 corners, and the barge delivery was 23 yuan and 6 corners, and the transaction was also limited. As the end of the year is approaching for domestic sugar, the firms are not in a hurry to re-enter, and although the market price has not changed much, it has shown a slight relaxation. Gao Huanggang Qing, dozens of bags were drawn out by the waiting firm, and the Chao group shouted at 13 yuan and a half, but no transaction was made. The price of red turning slightly opened was 14 yuan. The higher-priced decision white of the Jian group shouted at 21 yuan and was not made. It is heard that the price of Xinghua Dagong powder to be applied and drawn must be 24 yuan and a half, and the upper red is 17 yuan, which are difficult to calculate.</p>
<p>Today, 60 bags of sugar will be transported to Xingang, and the export to Qingdao will be slightly accommodated.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Raw Peanuts and Peanut Products Prices Both Loosen, Qingdao Exports Slightly More Accommodating</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondent: The arrival of new raw peanuts in the area has been relatively strong recently, with 2,000 to 3,000 packages arriving daily. Market inventories are estimated to be 50,000 packages in total. Prices have loosened slightly, with over 7,000 packages transacted at $10.40, purchased by foreign firms and oil mills. Other transactions include large-sized peanuts at $11.20 for 1,300 packages.</p>
<p>Peanut inventories are relatively low, totaling 20,000 packages. Recently, foreign firms have been inactive, and the demand from Shanghai businesses has been weak. Recently, peanuts from Gaomi were offered at $8.20 for 1,600 packages, and peanuts from Wangtai were offered at $7.80, but no transactions were made. Inquiries have been made about export procedures for peanuts in the area. Currently, procedures are slightly more accommodating, requiring only a report to the cooperative, which then requests permission, and goods can be loaded. Previously, payment was required in advance, but now import payments for Southern goods can be used to offset the cost, making it more convenient. However, external fees remain the same and are difficult to reduce.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 224 packages of dates arrived from Tianjin, and 150 bundles of dried vermicelli arrived from Yantai. Today, 800 packages of raw peanuts are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Kelp Supply and Demand in Equilibrium</h3>
<p>Kelp arrivals have been consistent recently, and sales are good. Yesterday, a batch of "Dragon Teeth" kelp was offered at prices ranging from $18.20 to $18.80 and $19.00. The market is stable.</p>
<h3>Fresh Mushrooms Very Scarce</h3>
<p>Freshly cultivated mushrooms are very scarce due to limited supply. Yesterday, ten packages were sold, with high-grade mushrooms at $225.80 and regular mushrooms at $210.09, up $10 from the previous market price.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Guangdong Patchouli's Sales Gradually Expanding</h3>
<p>Due to seasonal factors, Guangdong patchouli has been quiet for a long time, with the lowest price only around $10 per dan (a unit of weight). Recently, merchants from the north have been purchasing it, revitalizing the market. Yesterday, 70 to 80 packages were transacted at $14. According to brokerage houses, inventories are no more than 200 packages. However, with the arrival of spring, sales are expected to increase, so people are holding on to their stocks, unwilling to sell cheaply.</p>
<h3>Star Anise Supply Temporarily Cut Off, Prices High at $100</h3>
<p>Previously, star anise prices fell from $100 to $84 due to excessive arrivals. However, continuous demand from various businesses has nearly exhausted the stock. As a result, local inventories are less than 100 packages, and suppliers seem unlikely to continue sourcing, as they have difficulty making a profit based on previous sale prices. This has led to a temporary supply disruption and tightening market conditions. The current market price is a high $100, and a transaction is expected soon.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Domestic and Foreign Silk Prices Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market surged again in Japan and the United States. New York's 83-cent Japanese silk rose by 5 cents, and 75-cent Japanese silk rose by 4 cents. Shanghai's "B" grade white filature rose by 5 cents, and Guangdong silk rose by 2 cents. Exchange futures prices rose by 4 cents for both near and far terms. Yokohama spot prices rose by another $17, and futures rose by $11. The local silk market has become increasingly heated as a result. Users were offering $1460 for 18/20 white filature yesterday, and dry cocoons have risen to $360, reaching an unprecedented high. Foreign firms' transactions in English, French, and American white filature are unable to develop. Indian tussah silk continues to sell well, with prices up $30. A total of 20 piculs were transacted, and users estimated they could do 30 piculs. Yesterday, 35 pieces were exported to Yantai.</p>
<h3>January Statistics for New York Raw Silk</h3>
<p>The monthly statistics for New York raw silk inventory and sales last month were revealed yesterday by Reuters. The statistics indicate that New York's raw silk imports decreased sharply, while consumption increased. The former is due to the upcoming New Year holiday for Japanese silk factories and the direct impact of raw material shortages in Japan. The latter is due to increased demand for silk from American mills producing spring and summer fabrics. The inventory, sales, and import figures for New York raw silk are excerpted below (unit: piculs):</p>
<h3>Coal: Matsuura Bituminous Coal Inventory Increases</h3>
<p>The supply of Matsuura bituminous coal has suddenly increased recently. A foreign firm recently brought in a new shipment of over 2,000 tons to be transported through a certain route and stored in warehouses in Pudong, totaling 6,000 to 7,000 tons with the existing inventory. As a result, the stockpiles are difficult to move. However, suppliers are unwilling to lower prices lightly due to cost considerations. Competitors are offering screened lump coal at $43 per ton, run-of-mine coal at $41, and coal dust at $37, which is more expensive than Indian coal in the grey market.</p>

<h3>Case of Japanese Illegal Detention of Foreign Vessels: British Consulate to Lodge Protest, Captain of Yongzhen Relays Details of Detention</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the three foreign vessels, Yongzhen, Haida, and Hafia, being illegally detained by Japanese warships, the British Consulate General in Shanghai has taken it seriously. The owner of the Yongzhen, Mr. Mallet, was questioned on the afternoon of the day before yesterday about the detention. A strong protest will be lodged with the Japanese side. The Norwegian vessel Hafia arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday morning, and the Haida is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. The following is a report by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>British Consulate Questioned About Detention</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the British Consul General in Shanghai summoned the British owner of the Yongzhen, Mr. Mallet, to the consulate on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The Yongzhen was illegally detained by a Japanese warship near the Yanghekou River mouth near Haizhou on the 27th of last month and forced to sail to Qingdao. Although it was released after negotiations, the questioning was to clarify the detention process. The consular judge questioned Mr. Mallet, first asking if there were any contraband items on the Yongzhen. He replied, "No." He was then asked, "Do you know that Britain and Japan are not at war?" He replied, "No." He was then asked, "Since you know that we are not at war, the Japanese side naturally has no right to detain British merchant ships. Why did you obey their orders and sail to Qingdao?" He replied, "Because I was forced by strong coercion and could not resist." He was then asked about the detention in Qingdao and the business losses. The consular judge deemed the case clear and dismissed Mr. Mallet.</p>
<p>Preparing to Lodge a Strong Protest with Japan</p>
<p>According to reliable sources obtained by a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the Japanese side's detention of the British vessel was completely without legal basis and was clearly intended to squeeze out the interests of British residents. Although the Japanese side claimed it was a matter for the Qingdao Customs authorities, the detention occurred near the Yanghekou River mouth near Haizhou, which is under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province. If the Customs authorities deemed it necessary to detain the vessel, it should have been sailed to Shanghai for inspection by the Jianghai Customs, which would have been legal. The fact that it was forced to sail to Qingdao in Shandong Province shows that the Japanese side was making excuses and could not justify their actions. Therefore, the British Consulate General, in order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of British residents in China, has decided to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese side to prevent similar unfortunate incidents from happening again in the future.</p>
<p>Details of the Detention as Reported in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the British vessel Yongzhen was detained by the Japanese authorities south of Haizhou last Saturday (the 28th) on false charges of smuggling arms and ammunition. It was then rescued by the British warship Birmingham, which sailed from Weihaiwei to Qingdao. After being released, it sailed south and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) morning. According to Captain Mallet of the Yongzhen, the Yongzhen departed from Shanghai on January 21 and arrived at the Hejinggang (transliteration) River, 30 miles upstream of Shaoyang River (transliteration) on the 23rd. Unloading began the next day. On the 24th and 25th, two Japanese planes flew low and circled over the vessel. On the 26th, more Japanese planes flew over the port and bombed two sailboats 500 yards from the Yongzhen, as well as a warehouse, killing 20 people. Captain Mallet received information that the water gate five miles upstream was about to be closed, so he decided to sail away from the port and return to Shanghai. Before 7:00 a.m. on January 28, the Yongzhen was stopped by a Customs patrol boat nine miles out of the river and ordered to sail to Qingdao. Captain Mallet refused. At 7:00 a.m., people from the patrol boat boarded the Yongzhen and again ordered it to sail to Qingdao. Captain Mallet still refused. At 9:00 a.m., two Japanese destroyers sent people to board the Yongzhen and said that if they did not comply, they would use force. Captain Mallet was forced to order the vessel to sail to Qingdao. Two other Norwegian vessels were also unloading cargo at Hejinggang and were escorted to Qingdao by the Customs patrol boat along with the Yongzhen. They arrived in Qingdao at 7:00 a.m. on the 29th. Twenty minutes later, the British warship Birmingham sailed into Qingdao. The British Consul General in Qingdao immediately began negotiations with the Japanese authorities. However, before the negotiations were completed, at 8:00 a.m. the next morning, the Birmingham's captain ordered the Yongzhen to sail out of Qingdao with them and escorted it to a certain location before the Birmingham sailed back to Weihaiwei. Captain Mallet later learned that the Norwegian vessels had sent out a wireless message, and the Birmingham had rushed to Qingdao to rescue them after receiving the message. The Yongzhen originally had a Czech wireless operator, but unfortunately he did not make it on board when the Yongzhen departed from Shanghai. Captain Mallet believed that he must have been detained in Hongkou while on his way to the ship, so there was no one on board who could send a wireless message. When the Customs patrol boat officers boarded the Yongzhen, they said that the vessel was suspected of carrying arms and ammunition, and then searched it, but only found pork. When they arrived in Qingdao, the Japanese authorities demanded to check the vessel's license and logbook, but this was refused. After the Birmingham arrived in Qingdao, the Customs authorities admitted to using force to detain the Yongzhen, which was surprising. After Captain Mallet returned to Shanghai, he reported the whole incident to the shipping company and the British Consulate. Regarding the Japanese side's accusation that the Yongzhen was smuggling arms and ammunition to guerrillas, British naval and consular officials in Shanghai investigated the matter yesterday at the consulate and found no evidence. No official statement has been released. A Japanese spokesman stated at a press conference yesterday that they had received information from the Customs that the Yongzhen was not sailing to the destination specified in its vessel license, thus violating Customs regulations, and said that the claim that Japanese destroyers detained the three vessels was not accurate. The Japanese Navy did not directly participate in the matter. The Japanese destroyers were only conducting routine patrols and sailed to Qingdao. When a reporter asked if this meant that the Japanese Navy was indirectly assisting the Customs patrol boat, which would hinder foreign vessels from sailing in the future, the spokesman consulted for a moment before replying, "No," and said that the detention of the Yongda on December 31 by the Japanese Navy was considered closed and the vessel was allowed to sail as usual.</p>
<p>Hafia Arrives in Shanghai, Haida to Follow</p>
<p>After negotiations, the Norwegian vessels Haida and Hafia were released. The Hafia left Qingdao at 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The ship docked at buoys 26 and 27 on the Huangpu River. According to the owner, Mr. C. Andersen, a Norwegian, the cash and legal tender confiscated by the Japanese side have all been returned after negotiations with the Norwegian consulate, and the damage was light. The Haida left Qingdao at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Yongzhen to Sail to Tianjin, Kailin to Test the Waters</p>
<p>It has also been learned that there are still four Japanese warships stationed outside the Yanghekou River mouth on the Funing Line. In order to prevent the Japanese warships from harassing them, the Chinese guerrillas have removed the navigation marks, so shipping has lost its target. It is questionable whether the area can continue to be sailed. Therefore, the British Yongzhen has decided to change course to Tianjin in the coming days. It is heard that the Hafia and Kailin are still planning to test sail to Funing to load local goods, but the exact date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Two Puppet Regimes in Beijing and Shanghai Compete for Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Nanjing "Reformed Government" learned that Shanghai's tax revenue was excellent and wanted to get involved. It sent people from its "Ministry of Finance" to Shanghai under the guise of investigating miscellaneous taxes and levies to thoroughly assess Shanghai's tax revenue. The "Shanghai Municipal Government," however, felt increasingly resentful, as all consumption taxes (likin) had already been abolished by a "decree" from the "Reformed" authorities as of February 1, and now they were coveting other tax revenues.</p>
<h3>Telephone Line on Hongqiao Road Cut, Communication Disrupted, Over 200 Feet of Line Lost, Japanese Troops Search Without a Trace</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the telephone line at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Route Robegan was stolen yesterday (the 1st) morning, disrupting telephone services for 20 telephone subscribers in the Hongqiao district. This is the sixth time telephone wires have been stolen on Hongqiao Road since last May. The Shanghai Telephone Company's emergency team received the alert shortly after midnight on the same day and immediately went to the barrier at the railway crossing in the area with the police department's constables. A Japanese soldier was dispatched by the Japanese authorities to escort them to the scene of the theft for investigation. They found that 240 feet of cable containing 101 pairs of telephone lines had been stolen and that some cables had been cut, apparently to be stolen. Soon after, more Japanese soldiers arrived to guard the area, hiding on the side of the road in the hope that the thieves would return to the scene to carry away the cut cables that had not yet been taken. However, no thieves returned until dawn. They then searched Chinese houses in the area at dawn, but there was no trace of the stolen cables. According to a statement issued by the telephone company yesterday, the interrupted telephone service in the area is expected to be restored tonight.</p>
<h3>Pudong Guerrillas Disrupt Water and Electricity Supply, Japanese-Occupied Area Plunged into Darkness, Water Pipes Still Unrepaired</h3>
<p>Another disturbance occurred in the Japanese-occupied area along the Pudong Riverfront at 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, with all the lights going out completely and plunging the area into darkness. Japanese troops and puppet police were dispatched to the main roads to announce a curfew. The Dongchang Road ferry across the river was closed early, and all stores closed their doors, leaving no one on the streets, creating a dead zone. At the same time, the water supply was also cut off, and all the tea houses had no water to sell, forcing residents to go to bed early, as if war was imminent. The Japanese and their puppets were disturbed all night, but nothing happened. The situation eased slightly after dawn yesterday morning, and order was restored on the streets, but the water supply was still cut off, and the water source was cut off all day. The tea houses could not resume business, and residents had to find ways to fetch water from the Pudong River and river floods for drinking. It is understood that the disruption of water and electricity was caused by the guerrillas. The broken power line was on Pudong Avenue. Yesterday, the power plant identified the damaged area and dispatched workers to repair it. However, the location of the broken water pipe has not yet been found, so it is still questionable whether the water supply can be restored this morning. This shows that the Pudong guerrillas are becoming more active.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Rickshaws Still Not Released, Two Chinese Directors Plead for Rickshaw Pullers, Authorities Still Need to Consider Carefully</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association, in order to request that the Public Works Department stop shortening rickshaw shafts and extend the deadline for modifying rickshaw wheels, sent representatives to petition five Chinese directors. The directors expressed sympathy and promised to mediate. They first negotiated with the Public Works Department to release the confiscated rickshaws. The association's representatives had originally planned to petition various public organizations again yesterday to ask for assistance, but they were advised by Chinese directors Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, etc., that the association's members were emotionally charged and feared that there would be accidents along the way, so they temporarily cancelled the plan. The Chinese directors are concerned about this case and appointed Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu as representatives. They visited the heads of the Public Works Department and the Police Department of the Public Works Department yesterday to ask them to order the police stations to release the confiscated vehicles first to maintain the livelihoods of the coolies. The Public Works Department stated that the Mutual Aid Association's request to waive the inspection fee required careful consideration, so it is unclear whether the vehicles confiscated by the police stations would be released. It will be known today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Money Industry Association Resolved Yesterday on Various Matters Before and After the Year-End Settlement, Stipulated Interest Rates, Time for Collecting Bills, etc., Interbank Lending Rate to Open Until the 17th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 40th regular meeting of member representatives of the third session at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the association on Ningbo Road. Representatives from 43 companies, including Fuyuan, Wufeng, Shunkang, Tongrun, Zhentai, Hefei, Yida, and Cunde, attended, including Zhang Mengzhou, Zhang Wenbo, Pei Yunqing, Shen Jingbiao, Lu Shuchen, Yan Dayou, Zhao Songyuan, and Xi Jiming, totaling over 60 people. Lu Shuchen chaired the meeting, and Secretary Ge Huaiqing recorded the proceedings. The reports included: Minutes of the previous meeting, incoming and outgoing documents for January, totaling 548 items, and two joint meetings of the industry held at the association in January. Various reports on the preparation of reserves. The discussion items included: Please discuss and decide on the handling of business before and after the 27th year-end settlement. The 27th year-end settlement date was decided as February 18 (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve). Regarding the interest issue before the year-end settlement, it was decided that interest would be paid at 3% until February 13, and overdue interest would be added after February 13. The time for collecting bills was decided as 4:00 p.m. on February 18 for interbank collection of bills in the market. After that time, each company should collect from each other, limited to 6:00 p.m. It was decided that the interbank lending rate in the market would be open until February 17, and the meeting would adjourn at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Four Remittance Banks Reorganized</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the banking industry that the money industry decided that after the 27th year-end settlement on January 18, there would be four days of vacation on February 19, 20, 21, and 22 to organize everything. Business would resume on the 23rd. Banks will have a four-day spring vacation during the year-end settlement period, but in the days before the year-end settlement, they will extend their office hours to handle internal settlements and remittance matters. As for the 43 remittance banks, four of them have reported to the association and have been approved for reorganization during this year-end settlement period, which involves changing the names of shareholders and managers. It is expected that all 43 of these companies will eventually be listed, but no one has yet announced an increase in capital.</p>
<p>Financial Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>Although the financial market on the isolated island is in a time of war, it remains stable due to the government's appropriate handling, the efforts of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank to regulate, and the handling of interbank mortgage lending. This is very different from the year before. Various interest rates have rarely changed. The daily lending rate for money shops is between 1.1% and 1.3%. The discount rate for the Discount Committee is 7.5%, and the lending rate is 2.5%. The interbank lending rate for bank reserves is 2.5% in national currency and 2.2% for remittances. The discount rate is 2.5% in national currency and 2.0% for remittances. The above three have remained unchanged throughout.</p>
<p>Various Industries Preparing to Pass the Year-End</p>
<p>The year-end settlement period for various industries is usually based on the money industry. Now that the year-end settlement period is approaching, various factories, businesses, and companies in the city have been preparing separately. For loans made, invoices have been distributed for local loans, and personnel have been sent to collect foreign loans. At the same time, responsible managers are mobilizing funds to repay outstanding debts to money shops as much as possible or using goods to mortgage to banks and shops. However, due to the war, businesses operating domestic goods within the Shanghai concessions have experienced abnormal development, and the goods produced have earned high profits. Therefore, there is no problem for various industries to safely pass the year-end settlement period.</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppets Control Export Goods from Yantai, British Vessels Suffer Restrictions, Two Vessels Fail to Load Goods When Leaving Yantai, Japanese Attempt to Obtain Foreign Exchange Overseas</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that Yantai is one of China's main seaports. After allowing Western merchants in the area a two-week grace period, the Japanese began prohibiting foreign trade and shipping yesterday (the 1st) unless bills of exchange were issued by the quasi-official Yokohama Specie Bank. Otherwise, export licenses would not be issued. This new blow to foreign businesses has already had an immediate impact.</p>
<p>Two British Vessels</p>
<p>Namely Jardine Matheson's Yisheng and Taikoo's Shuntian, sailed out of Yantai yesterday. The goods originally to be carried by the two vessels could not be loaded due to the new export restrictions. A Japanese embassy spokesman told foreign reporters last night that the exchange and export regulations implemented in Yantai and Weihaiwei yesterday were the same as the regulations implemented in Qingdao by the "Provisional Government" in North China through the customs authorities. These regulations are not intended to discriminate against merchants or Chinese merchants from third countries in the above two locations. According to local merchants familiar with the situation in Qingdao last night, the Japanese are trying to raise foreign exchange reserves for the "Federal Reserve Bank." After the implementation of this restriction, the Japanese can achieve their goal through all exports from Shandong. By handling exchange transactions through the Yokohama Specie Bank, the bank can obtain foreign exchange overseas and pay exporters at the exchange rate set in Japan, which is one shilling and two pence or 29 US cents per "Federal Reserve" yuan. According to a financial expert who recently visited Qingdao, this false exchange value has bound and harmed the once thriving export trade in the port. According to another merchant who recently came to Shanghai from North China, foreign businesses in the area are almost unable to operate due to the exchange regulations. A reporter asked a Japanese embassy spokesman last night whether these regulations were first notified to the Shanghai Jianghai Customs Commissioner and approved by him, or whether the Chinese Customs had been divided into two separate systems. The spokesman replied that it was still one system, but the customs authorities were acting on facts and not on theory. The various customs authorities have</p>
<p>Accomodated to the situation. The spokesman also replied that there must be some indirect contact between the Jianghai Customs Commissioner and the "Provisional Government" "Ministry of Finance" on the question of whether there was any contact. According to this restriction, which is now being implemented in Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, the restriction has not yet been extended to Tianjin, a major shipping center in North China, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that at a recent press conference hosted by the Japanese side, a reporter asked the Japanese embassy spokesman about the issue of export licenses in Yantai. The spokesman, after investigating the matter, stated at a press conference yesterday (the 1st) that since January 15, the "Provisional Government" in Peiping had promulgated regulations on export licenses and exchange in Yantai and Weihaiwei, which were the same as those implemented in Qingdao. It was believed that the "Provisional Government" felt it was necessary to</p>
<p>Expand these regulations to the above two seaports in order to stabilize the paper money of the "Federal Reserve Bank." A reporter asked who promulgated these regulations and who implemented them. The spokesman replied that the "instructions" were issued by the "Ministry of Finance" in Peiping and handed over to the customs authorities for implementation. The reporter asked, since the customs in the two locations are managed by the Shanghai</p>
<p>Customs Commissioner, how could that "ministry" issue these "instructions?" The spokesman replied that this "order" may have been issued from Shanghai. When asked if there was any contact between the customs personnel, the spokesman replied that they had ways of making indirect contact.</p>
<h3>1,000 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Return Home by Ship, Moaning in Agony, Screaming Desperately</h3>
<p>At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the Japanese Red Cross ship Chikasa Maru, which was docked at the Japanese Osaka Wharf in Hongkou, set sail with over 1,000 wounded Japanese soldiers on board to be transported back to Japan for treatment. These Japanese soldiers were all seriously injured and could not be treated in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>No Japanese Warships Outside Zhenhai Port, Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Can Rest Assured</h3>
<p>Although Japanese warships had been spying outside Zhenhai Port and had once fired on Chuanshan, they were all random shots and caused no damage. According to reports from Ningbo to Shanghai, although the whereabouts of the Japanese warships off the coast are erratic, there are no spies off the coast of various ports in eastern Zhejiang. The coastal garrisons are also on strict alert. The military discipline inspection team recently visited Zhejiang to inspect and expressed satisfaction with the coastal defense. Fellow townsmen in Shanghai can rest assured.</p>
<h3>Citizens Group Solicitation Committee Sets Regular Deadlines; Second Performance Review; The Committee Notifies Team Leaders Yesterday to Intensify Solicitation to Benefit Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Solicitation Committee yesterday notified the leaders of each solicitation team that the second performance review will be held on February 10th, urging them to continue their efforts to benefit refugees. Team leaders who have not yet received their badges or need to obtain more sponsorship certificates are asked to come to the association to collect them immediately.</p>
<p>Formulating Slogans: To arouse all citizens to participate in the refugee sponsorship movement, the group has specially formulated various colorful slogans, such as "A monthly donation of two yuan in national currency can save a refugee's life" and "It is a pleasure to do good deeds," all of which are extremely eye-catching. Starting yesterday, staff were sent to major hotels, restaurants, and public entertainment venues to post them, in order to widely promote the message.</p>
<p>Recruiting Staff: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, located at 93 Guangdong Road in this city, now requires one male staff member who is capable of statistics and field investigation work, and who has his own bicycle and is familiar with the routes as qualifications. The monthly salary is thirty yuan, and the association will provide lunch. All high school graduates can bring their resumes and certificates to the association's rehabilitation office to register from now until the 6th, from 2 pm to 4 pm every day, and then take the examination on schedule.</p>
<p>Employing Refugees: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has been entrusted by enthusiastic people to employ refugees for the third time. Refugees from various reception centers who feel they meet the requirements can be recommended by the director of the reception center to contact the association's rehabilitation office at 93 Guangdong Road. The openings include: three female workers for yarn spinning, three apprentices for printing shops, four workers, ten salespeople, fifteen maids, one maid who can make Ningbo dumplings, one apprentice for washing and dyeing, five apprentices for wood carving, seven female workers for shoe factories, four apprentices for sock factories, ten female workers, six female workers for industrial cooperatives, three elder sisters, ten punching press workers, one salesperson for school books, two female trainees for wireless radio, two ordinary male workers, and one female worker aged thirteen or fourteen.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association Concerned About Goods Stranded in Ningbo; Stockpiles Exceed 20 Million; Plans to Request Approval from Two Ministries to Clear</h3>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the export of 55 kinds of local products, such as cotton, cotton yarn, and tung oil, the value of goods stockpiled in Ningbo has exceeded 20 million. Although Governor Huang of Zhejiang Province approved the export, citing that Shanghai is a non-violent control area, the Zhejiang Customs still does not allow exports because it has not received orders from the Ministry of Finance. The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce is continuing to telegraph Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai also believes that at this time of great conclusion, the stagnation of goods in Ningbo and the inability to sell them abroad will greatly affect local finance and the distress of farmers and merchants. They will also hold a meeting in the next few days to request the two ministries of finance and economy to allow the clearance of goods stranded in Ningbo, in order to alleviate the suffering of farmers and merchants and circulate the local economy.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Remittances to China Last Year Exceeded 600 Million Yuan; Donations to the Government Exceeded 100 Million Yuan; Stability of Wartime Finance Relies on This</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese contributions to the motherland are substantial. The amount remitted in the entire year of the 27th year of the Republic exceeded 600 million yuan. The stable situation of our country's wartime finances today is partly due to this. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to a recent announcement from Hong Kong, foreign exchange transactions in Hong Kong were quite busy last year, a large part of which was due to remittances from overseas Chinese. Statistics show that the amount remitted by overseas Chinese in the 27th year of the Republic exceeded 600 million yuan, of which direct donations to the government reached 120 million yuan. This number is more than double the amount remitted during the most prosperous period of foreign economy. Its contribution to foreign exchange is self-evident. It is heard that more than half of the 120 million yuan of donations came from Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. Other overseas Chinese decided to donate a total of 1.7 million, 1.3 million, and 110,000 people. In addition, the Western Hemisphere donated more than 27 million yuan to war expenses this year, including 15 million yuan from the United States, 3 million yuan from Canada, and 9 million yuan from Cuba, Mexico, Central America, and South America.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese remittances have always been busiest before the Lunar New Year, because the end of the year and the beginning of the year are times of great need. As the Lunar New Year is approaching, in order to allow recipients to spend the New Year, overseas Chinese remittances at this time will definitely be better than usual. These remittances can arrive within ten days, so it is expected that these remittances will increase this week. At the same time, foreign exchange transactions between Hong Kong and Shanghai will also become more frequent, because overseas Chinese remittances are centered in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Defense Department Orders All Ships to Register; Failure to Do So by Deadline Will Result in Cancellation of Navigation Rights; Meta and Tangsai to Join Direct Shipping Soon</h3>
<p>After the military authorities of Zhejiang Province approved the direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo in order to relieve freight transportation, all ships joined the shipping one after another. The Ningbo Defense Command specially ordered a deadline for supplementary registration, otherwise the navigation rights will be cancelled. The Ningbo-Taiwan ships Meta and Tangsai also sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai to join the direct shipping. The Xinanna and Moufu ships are scheduled to sail to Ningbo for the second time today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo Defense Department Sets Registration Deadline: The Ningbo Defense Command stipulates in Article 2 of the Zhejiang East Shipping Regulations that the approved ships must provide a guarantee of more than one year of operation and be inspected by the Ningbo-Wenzhou Shipping Administration Office before they can be allowed to navigate. It has ordered all shipping companies to comply. Before these procedures are completed, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants and facilitate the transportation of local goods during the Lunar New Year, it has specially submitted a request to the Group Army Headquarters to temporarily allow merchant ships hired by merchants to navigate. Now it has received a reply from the headquarters approving it, but ordering them to complete the registration procedures as soon as possible. The Defense Department has now agreed with the Ningbo Shipping Administration Office to set a deadline for completion. In the future, if the new registration procedures are not completed after the deadline, even if merchants hire them, they will not be allowed to sail to Ningbo, and their previous registration will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Meta and Tangsai Join Direct Shipping: The Meta ship of the Portuguese company Meili and the Tangsai ship of the American company Huamei have always sailed on the Ningbo-Taiwan line. They were ordered to stop sailing to Shanghai, so the two ships did not sail on the Ningbo-Taiwan line. It is now learned that the two ships sailed directly from Ningbo to Shanghai yesterday. It is heard that they will also join the direct shipping to transport local products. In addition, the German ship Hana, which sails on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, has also recently had news of joining the shipping to Ningbo, but it is not yet fully determined.</p>
<p>Xinanna and Moufu Sail to Ningbo for the Second Time: After the direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo was approved, the Moufu ship of Lihua Foreign Firm, the Xinanna ship of Weilihan Company, and the Liangzhou ship of Taikoo Foreign Firm have all been sailing to Ningbo. The Moufu and Xinanna ships returned to Shanghai one after another yesterday morning. After unloading the goods, they are scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo for the second time today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Association Plans to Establish a Beggar Children's Training Institute</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association believes that children are the lifeline of the country and the future masters of society. Since the outbreak of the war, the number of refugees in this city has increased sharply. In order to cultivate children, the association is actively carrying out its work. In addition to the more than ten newspaper boy schools that have been established, which have achieved remarkable results and have been deeply appreciated by Chinese and foreign people, as recorded in this newspaper, it has recently learned that it is particularly pitiful for ordinary beggar children to wander the streets, and innocent children are easily tempted by bad environments. Therefore, the chairman of the association, Chen Heqin, Chen Jicheng, and others decided to set up a beggar children's training institute to accommodate them and teach them considerable intelligence so that they can become good people in the future society. In order to raise funds, the association specially convened a board meeting yesterday and decided to hold a recreational event immediately, and invite the entertainment industry to support and participate in the performance, and all the income from the tickets will be used for the expenses of the beggar children's training institute. The organization of the recreational event was also established yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medical Association's Work in the Health Experiment Zone Achieves Remarkable Results Since Its Implementation</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, the population of the Special District has increased sharply, and health problems need to be paid attention to urgently. The Public Health Committee of the Chinese Medical Association, in view of this, specially designated an area west of Chengdu Road, north of Avenyue Road, east of Carter Road, and south of Suzhou River as a health experiment zone last year (including Datong Road, Chihong Road, Shanhai Pass Road, and Xinzha Road) to try out various health work and set up an office and clinic at 25 Chi Ham Road. Since its opening, with the assistance of the Health Department of the Engineering Bureau, various health works in the area have been carried out resolutely and smoothly. The starting method is to send public health nurses to visit homes in the area, instill health knowledge, and improve living habits. If there are patients, those with minor illnesses are guided to go to the office for medical treatment, and those with serious illnesses are sent doctors to their homes for diagnosis and treatment, or transferred to hospitals for treatment. Pregnant women are taught knowledge of pregnancy and urged to go to the clinic for examination on schedule. When they are about to give birth, they try to introduce obstetrics hospitals to deliver babies. Newborn babies are also provided with nutritious materials such as milk powder and cod liver oil. The outpatient department of the office has dentistry, general medicine for men and women, gynecology, pediatrics, venereal disease, leprosy, vaccination, etc. Children's meetings and mother's meetings are also held there. Now, a vaccination campaign is being held, and nurses in the area call out every day to persuade and vaccinate.</p>
<h3>Revitalize Rural Areas to Recover Leakage; Develop Small Rural Industries; Purchase, Transportation, and Sales Are Planned by the Cooperative Association as a Whole; Centralized Implementation to Reduce Costs and Promote Sales</h3>
<p>The National Government believes that there are a large number of rural handicraft industries and small-scale factories. These small industries, which are purely manual or semi-manual and semi-machinery, are mostly farmers engaged in the industry of various daily necessities. In the past, the number of exports overseas every year was very large. Since the Sino-Japanese War, some factories are located in the war zone, and the machinery has been destroyed. There is no way to relocate. Those outside the war zone are fortunate that the machinery has not been destroyed, but due to traffic obstruction, it is not easy to carry out large-scale transportation. Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is making every effort to encourage the development of small industries, supplement farmers' lives, recover leakage, and return funds to rural areas. The China Industrial Cooperative Association is the only agency that guides the development of rural industry, and divides the country into four major regions, using social idle funds to engage in production, strive to promote the cooperative movement, and convene small industrial product exhibitions. The purchase, transportation, and sales of small industries are planned by the association as a whole, carried out centrally, reduce costs, promote sales, and avoid monopoly and exploitation by intermediate merchants. The value of small industrial products exported overseas last year and the year before is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Hongyun Ship Robbed by Bandits; Robbed at Liuhekou; About Ten Bandits</h3>
<p>The Hongyun Company's Hongyun ship sails to Liuhe, Qi, and Chongming's Haihongzong and other places. At 6 am on the 2nd (two days ago), as usual, it loaded cargo and passengers in Shanghai and exited. It first arrived at Liuhe. At about 10 am when it arrived at Liuhekou, passengers were getting on and off, cargo was being unloaded, and a rice barge from Liuhe was alongside, preparing to load. Suddenly, a pirate ship sailed over and leaned alongside. More than ten bandits, each holding guns, swarmed onto the ship. Seeing the bad situation, the rice barge untied the rope and retreated into the port. After the bandits boarded the ship, one who looked like a bandit leader went to the passenger cabin and said, "We are here to investigate a Suzhou person. Don't praise us." Then he left. Soon, more than ten people, holding long and short guns, entered and said, "Check the good people's certificate, take it out quickly, and the leather suitcase must also be taken out." Everyone was hesitating. One person showed a leather suitcase with two yuan in banknotes. After a bandit looked at it, he returned it to the original person. Everyone saw it and thought that the banknotes were still returned, so they did not suspect it was a bandit, and took them out one by one to hand them over for inspection. Unexpectedly, all the banknotes were robbed. After searching and robbing the lower passenger cabin, they went to the upper passenger cabin and the accounting room. All the luggage and clothes and hats of the passengers were robbed. Before leaving, they also took 29 bags of sugar transported to Haihong Port from the cabin and escaped. The robbery lasted for about an hour, and the loss was 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The ship did not sail further, and returned to Shanghai at about 12 o'clock. It arrived at the port at 4:30 pm. The crew went to the company to report. The ship started exporting as usual yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Yangshupu Yarn Factory Employees' January 28th Donation</h3>
<p>All the employees of Yangshupu Yarn Factory are sincerely patriotic and enthusiastic about good deeds. They held a donation campaign on the anniversary of January 28th this year, and took out a part of the donation, totaling 64 yuan, 4 jiao, and 8 fen in national currency, which was personally sent by Ms. He Peizhen and Ms. Shuai Yuqiu from the factory's preparation department to the Tongren Refugee Hospital on Bailinan Road in this city to be used for the hospital's rescue of refugees and refugee children. The factory employees care about their compatriots, and their enthusiasm is worthy of admiration.</p>
<h3>Pudong Oil Factories Occupied; Changde and Dade Xin Factories; Property Owners Unable to Consult</h3>
<p>The Japanese side, ignoring the property rights of Chinese businessmen in the occupied areas, has been occupying various factories that have been suspended after the war one after another. Yesterday, two oil factories in Pudong, Yangjiadu Changde and Dade Xin, which are very large in scale, were occupied by the Japanese at the same time. The two teams of soldiers of the Noike Unit of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in the two factories simultaneously withdrew and moved to the occupied electric light factory in Zhangjiabang. The two factories were led by a Japanese named Yoshida, with many ignorant Chinese people, to the factory to sort out the machinery. It is heard that they plan to recruit workers separately and start oil production in the near future. The original property owners of the two factories are unable to consult.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association Forms Review Committee; Urges Members to Strictly Abide by Laws</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that maintaining national health and treating diseases are different from other businesses, so the government has established strict management laws and regulations. The two associations proceed with pharmaceutical affairs based on the various management rules promulgated by the state. Since the government moved west and the competent authorities also moved west, but our industry is one of the special industries in society, and the two associations are legal groups, it is real to urge members to strictly abide by the rules for managing pharmaceutical merchants and the rules for amending the management of prepared drugs. In order to maintain the dignity of the industry and the interests of members, a member review committee was specially established. The meeting was held yesterday, and the following review rules were passed: Name: Shanghai New Pharmaceutical and Pharmaceutical Industry Association Member Review Committee; Committee: provisionally set at eleven members, which may be added when necessary, and elected by the joint meeting of the executive, supervisory, and advisory committees of the two associations; Powers: exclusively responsible for reviewing whether new members meet the requirements for admission; the results of the review shall be reported to the respective relevant associations separately; Standards: (A) refer to the pharmaceutical merchant management rules and the amended prepared drug management rules promulgated by the government for verification; (B) those who have obtained a pharmaceutical merchant license and request to join the association shall send personnel to investigate whether they are following the rules; those who have not obtained a pharmaceutical merchant license must investigate whether they are handling matters according to law; if the results of the investigation are considered qualified, they may be passed; (C) the review procedure shall be completed within two weeks; Supplementary Provisions: These rules shall be implemented after being passed by the joint meeting of the executive, supervisory, and advisory committees of the two associations, and the same shall apply to amendments.</p>

<h3>Lunar New Year's Eve; Concessions Still Under Curfew</h3>
<p>The Lunar New Year's Eve is approaching in an instant. Residents of this city often cannot avoid being customary, and are particularly concerned about the curfew in the concessions on New Year's Eve. A reporter inquired from the Public Works Bureau yesterday and learned that although the concession authorities have not made a specific decision on the issue of the New Year's Eve curfew, due to the necessity of reality, it has been internally decided not to cancel the curfew or shorten the curfew time. However, in order to adapt to the habits of the majority of residents, depending on the actual needs, the curfew will not be implemented immediately at the beginning of the curfew time, but suspicious pedestrians must still be arrested, and each police station will increase patrol squads and search squads to step up patrols and searches of pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Time Must Be Expedited for Posting Various Parcels; Send Immediately After Customs Inspection; Avoid Temporary Congestion and Haste</h3>
<p>The United Mailing Group of Small Parcel Mail of the Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice yesterday, saying that the office hours of the group's window are from 9 am to 5 pm, without stopping during lunch time. Now it is found that most of the parcels are often delayed until after 3 pm before they can be sent, resulting in congestion, haste, and confusion, which is inconvenient for the post office and the public. In order to reduce the above difficulties, it is hoped that after completing the customs inspection procedures as soon as possible in the future, each sender will immediately send them to the respective windows, and do not delay any longer, so as not to miss the opportunity. This is a special notice.</p>

<h3>工部局一九三八年份　警務報吿（二）</h3>
<p>Within the Public Concession, there are twenty-five cinemas. Within the French Concession, there are ten. The films inspected by the Police Department consisted of 463 feature films, 941 short films, and 195 newsreels, totaling 4,493,194 feet in length. 150 films were approved for screening after cuts, and 16 were not allowed to be screened. Among these, one was allowed to be screened after the Film Censorship Committee accepted a protest and re-examined it. Printed materials and advertising posters of cinemas were also inspected by the Police Department. Of all the films, American productions accounted for 80 percent, Chinese productions 11 percent, British productions 7 percent, and other countries, including Soviet Russia, France, Germany, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, together accounted for 2 percent.</p>
<p>The Police Department periodically reviewed 315 kinds of Chinese newspapers and magazines, both large and small, as well as publications in English, French, German, Russian, and Japanese. Noteworthy content in these publications was translated daily. Eighty-six publications and four news agencies were warned by the police for publishing or disseminating inaccurate information or other inappropriate content. Several of these, due to the severity of the circumstances, were either banned or ordered to suspend publication temporarily. A total of twenty-seven individuals were prosecuted for selling obscene books and paintings, publishing obscene content, or violating Chinese publishing laws. These defendants were sentenced to fines ranging from ten to two hundred and fifty yuan each. Various bookstores were inspected from time to time, and several improper books were confiscated. Of the foreign language publications registered with the Police Department, thirty-three kinds, and of the Chinese publications, three hundred and fourteen kinds, one hundred and twenty-one voluntarily ceased publication.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the police force consisted of 487 Western personnel, 4426 Chinese personnel, 272 Japanese personnel, and 535 Indian personnel (including those in the inner ranks).</p>
<p>The northeast districts of the concessions have not yet been opened, therefore the traffic in the central and western districts is even more congested. The number of freight trucks has greatly increased, but the total number of licensed vehicles of all kinds has decreased compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Accidents and injury incidents on the streets have increased compared to the previous year, but decreased compared to 1936. The number of deaths, however, has more than doubled compared to the previous two years.</p>
<p>There are fewer reports regarding violations of traffic regulations in the Police Department's records. The number of cases prosecuted according to law is the lowest in the past ten years. The reason for this is the restriction of police power in the northern district and the post-war phenomenon at the beginning of the year. The Police Department sent personnel to various elementary schools to lecture on the importance of safety when walking. The audience totaled 12,025 people. Several kinds of traffic-related picture posters were distributed to the schools to supplement the lectures. Several of these posters were selected and posted in various alleyways at the beginning of summer. Professional lecturers went to various factories, teahouses, and refugee camps to lecture on the importance of safety when walking. The audience totaled more than 110,000 people.</p>
<p>Warning signs for vehicles to slow down have been erected near schools with a large number of students.</p>
<p>A vehicle lane change system has been implemented at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road, Race Course Road, Guangdong Road, and Beihai Road. As of the end of the year, it is still under trial.</p>

<h3>Many Thugs Arrested Last Night　Planning to Join the Pseudo "Self-Defense Corps"　Whether There Was Criminal Behavior Is Still Under Investigation　Pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an Flatters the Japanese　Recruiting Traitors to Organize Pseudo "Self-Defense Corps"</h3>
<p>Since the onset of winter, theft cases have occurred frequently within the concessions. Therefore, the police stations have stepped up the organization of search teams and patrol teams to maintain vigilance. Yesterday, the Lao Zha Police Station dispatched Western police officer No. 128, Chinese police officers No. 1305, No. 2581, and No. 3155 to search pedestrians within the concession. At 9:10 PM, they encountered three individuals at the intersection of Hankou Road and Guangxi Road: Wu Tianbao from Zhejiang, Li Jishan from Yangzhou, and Chen Jiabao from Shanghai. Suspecting their behavior, they stopped them for a search. They found a Mauser pistol on Wu, with four bullets inside, and another ten bullets in his pocket. They found a Mauser pistol on Li, with seven bullets inside, and another three bullets in his pocket. They found a handgun on Chen, with three bullets, and the gun and bullets were already loaded. They were all taken back to the police station, as briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Subsequently, four more accomplices were apprehended in Room 9 of the Shanghai Hotel on Hankou Road: Shen A'gen from Jiaxing, Jia Jinfu from Pudong, Wang A'rong from Hangzhou, and Huang Zhao's from Pudong. According to the results of the investigation, it was learned that the pseudo "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an, recently planned to ingratiate himself with the Japanese and ordered the organization of a so-called "Self-Defense Corps" to suppress the activities of guerrillas. However, it was stipulated that all members who surrendered must provide their own military equipment. Wu and his gang were recruited by the traitor Huang Yuming and prepared weapons to join the "Self-Defense Corps" together, hoping to have the opportunity to be promoted and make a fortune in the future. Unexpectedly, they were caught by the police station and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that due to the urgency of time, it was impossible to investigate whether the defendants had committed theft cases within the concession. Therefore, he requested permission for temporary detention to conduct a detailed investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the court ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Private Slaughter of Sick and Feeble Pigs　Complex Case　Defendant Released on Bail　Further Hearing Adjourned</h3>
<p>Recently, unclean pork was found for sale in the market within the French Concession, which was investigated as private slaughter of sick and feeble pigs mixed for sale, greatly affecting the public's health. Furthermore, the pigs kept in the Slaughterhouse Company's Yuexing Slaughterhouse (owned by Chen Zhiqiang), Yueshun Slaughterhouse (owned by Chen Zhangquan), and Quangen Slaughterhouse (owned by Sheng Quangen) were frequently missing. Therefore, the health authorities and the Slaughterhouse Company reported to the French Police Station, requesting a secret investigation. After investigation, it was found that Liu Peilin (30 years old) from Jiangyin, who was in charge of the pigs in the Slaughterhouse Company, colluded with butchers to secretly transport the pigs out for secret slaughter and mixed sale. The facility was located at No. 75 Dingxiang Lane, Aolihe Road. The police rushed to search and found a large vat of pork, and the principal offender, Liu Peilin, was arrested for investigation. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. The French Police Department has concluded its investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Liu Peilin was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Miao Qingbang questioned him. The lawyer Fei Xizhen, representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case and prosecuted him for professional embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiffs Chen Zhiqiang, Chen Zhangquan, and Sheng Quangen jointly retained lawyer Wang Shizong to file an incidental civil suit, demanding compensation for damages. The defendant retained lawyer Cai Xiaobai for defense. The plaintiffs stated that the pigs entrusted to the defendant for management were frequently missing, resulting in considerable losses, and requested strict investigation according to the law. When questioned, the defendant admitted to the embezzlement, stating that he was hired by the Meat Industry Association and the Slaughterhouse Association, and compensated for the missing pigs according to the amount. Furthermore, live pigs easily wandered around in the shed, which could easily lead to mistakes. The court found the case complex and ordered a further hearing on the 11th. The defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Robbers Quarreling Over Stolen Goods　One Person Arrested　Rickshaw Driver Colluding to Commit Robbery　Court Orders Adjourned Hearing</h3>
<p>Li Jizhang, 39 years old from Ningbo, the manager of Fuxing Lumber Mill at No. 974 Avenue Edward VII, carried a large bundle of cash, totaling 3,200 yuan, at 11:00 AM one day, intending to go to the Xinhua Bank on Avenue Joffre for deposit. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw passed the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Say Zo Sé, five robbers suddenly rushed out from the roadside and stopped Li's rickshaw, pretending to search and robbing all the cash before fleeing north. Seeing that the robbers were not carrying weapons, Li got out of the rickshaw and desperately chased after them, shouting loudly for thieves. One of the robbers, fleeing to the entrance of Gaosheng Lane on Danshui Road, scattered the banknotes on the road while fleeing towards the British Concession. The victim recovered 1,850 yuan and reported to the French Police Station, requesting an arrest. The robbers fled to the Gonghe Teahouse on Connaught Road to divide the loot, and quarreled due to the discrepancy in the amount. The Gordon Road Police Station learned of this and rushed to arrest the robber Zhang Haichang (29 years old, former rickshaw driver) from Nantong. The stolen money had been taken away by the remaining robbers. They then notified the French Police Station to dispatch detectives Geng Quanchang and Wu Wengang to bring Zhang back to the French Police Station. According to the confession, Sun Wugen (29 years old from Nantong), the rickshaw driver of the victim's family, colluded to commit the robbery along with the fugitives Zhu A'jin and Cai Mapi. Sun was subsequently arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them in the First Criminal Court and ordered a further hearing on the 7th. The defendants were taken into custody.</p>
<h3>College Student Establishes Personnel Agency　Accused of Defrauding Guarantee Deposits　Investigation Confirms One Year Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xie Xiangsheng, a graduate of a certain university, recently established a so-called personnel agency at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, engaging in marriage introductions and job placements to defraud others of their property. At the same time, he also advertised for male and female employees, collecting huge guarantee deposits. The Public Concession authorities investigated after receiving a report, but could not find evidence of his fraud, so no prosecution was initiated. Xie then took advantage of this opportunity and advertised again, claiming that he had obtained the approval of the Concession authorities. As a result, more people were deceived than before. Now, the General Patrol Room has received reports from male employee Shao Zihong, She Fenghui, female employee Chen Wen, Jin Zhiying, and Cao Huizhong, stating that they were all employees recruited by Xie through advertisements and had paid a total of 514.30 yuan in guarantee deposits. After serving until now, they have not received a single penny of salary. Now Xie is avoiding them and has also returned the rental furniture to the furniture store, clearly intending to embezzle the guarantee deposits they paid. The Chinese detective Sun Minchang confirmed the facts and managed to arrest Xie the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for embezzlement and argued that Xie's business was entirely a trick to deceive others of their property. If he is not severely punished, it would be difficult to deter others. Therefore, he requested that the court impose a severe sentence according to law to punish the illegal and deter others. Subsequently, Shao Zihong and others filed a case, proving the experience of being deceived. When questioned, Xie Xiangsheng admitted to collecting guarantee deposits from the plaintiffs, but claimed that he had obtained the consent of the plaintiffs to use the money they paid to compensate the guarantee deposits paid by former employees who had resigned. However, Shao and others denied this fact. Judge Feng Shide, after verifying the confession, sentenced Xie Xiangsheng to one year imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Woman Colludes With Paramour　Entices Young Girl Into Prostitution　Paramour Escapes, Paramour Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang Fumei, a 37-year-old woman from Changshu, had an affair with Zhu Jinlin from the same village. On the 15th of last month, she returned to her hometown and enticed Zhu Jinlin's uncle, Zhu Yaogen's 15-year-old daughter Yuexian, and Zhu Bingquan's 12-year-old daughter Xiuying, to come to Shanghai under the pretext of recommending them to work in a factory. After enticing them to Shanghai, they were lodged in an inn, and Yuexian was forced to receive guests and sell herself into prostitution. When the girl refused, and the girl's parents found out, they tracked them down to Shanghai. The girl was then hidden elsewhere. After reporting to the French Police Station, Wang Fumei was arrested by detectives the day before yesterday at No. 58 Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street. The two girls were also found. After interrogation, it was learned that Wang colluded with her paramour, and the paramour Zhu Jinlin had fled upon hearing the news. Only Wang was taken to the police station. Yesterday, she was sent to the Second Special Court, requesting a postponed investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated her in the First Criminal Court. The two victimized girls testified about being abducted and forced into prostitution. When questioned, Wang Fumei vehemently denied it, stating that the plaintiffs did not allow her to enter their Zhu family, and they falsely accused her out of resentment. The court ordered a further hearing on the 11th. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Carpenter Carrying Wooden Boards　Slips and Falls to Death</h3>
<p>Wang Jintang, a 45-year-old carpenter from Yangzhou, lived on the fourth floor of No. 41 Huacheng Road, French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, Wang went to Houda Lumber Mill at No. 178 Route Lafayette to purchase 18 wooden boards, which he carried back himself. Unexpectedly, when he reached the entrance of No. 0 Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, it was raining and the road was slippery. Wang slipped and fell, and was injured in the neck and throat by the wooden boards, causing asphyxiation and fainting. Patrolman No. 764 discovered this, hired a vehicle to take him to the Avenue Joffre Police Station, and transferred him to Guangci Hospital. He died before receiving treatment. The body was then transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for a coroner's examination. The wife of the deceased, Wang Chen, was notified to the case, and a report will be filed with the Second Special Court today to send personnel for examination.</p>
<h3>Russian Merchant Xinzhi Bank　Manager Sued, Trial Suspended</h3>
<p>Shanghai Russian merchant Xinzhi Bank, formerly managed by White Russians Vosipov (transliteration) and Bitrov (transliteration), also had a branch in Harbin. Due to financial difficulties in 1936, it declared bankruptcy. The Ministry of Finance appointed White Russian lawyer Kuoliesisnichen Kuo (transliteration) as liquidator. However, because the property of the Harbin Xinzhi branch was illegally occupied by a certain party, the liquidation procedures have not yet been completed. A Soviet woman named Huotingsikaya (transliteration), who worked as a caretaker, had successively deposited a total of 2,256.30 national currency dollars in the Harbin branch until the date of bankruptcy. During the liquidation period of the bank, she received 112.81 yuan, but the balance has not yet been received. Recently, she retained a lawyer to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Vosipov, Bitrov, and Kuoliesisnichen Kuo of colluding in fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Liao, held a hearing once. The plaintiff stated that the Xinzhi Bank operated by the defendants claimed to be registered in the United States and reliable. Only after the bankruptcy was it known that the bank's capital was insufficient and not registered in the United States, which was obviously fraudulent. As for Kuoliesisnichen Kuo transferring funds from the Harbin branch to the Shanghai branch, it was obviously a breach of trust. The court did not ask too many questions, even though the plaintiff's representative's statement was inconsistent with the complaint. The defendant's lawyer stated to the court that there were procedural issues in this case. Even if the court had jurisdiction, it would only be a civil matter, and the defendants had no fraudulent acts. He requested a judgment according to law. The court ordered a postponed hearing on record. It is now learned that Judge Liao has ruled that the entire trial of this case be suspended, and the trial will proceed after the plaintiff files a suit in the Civil Court to determine the identity.</p>
<h3>Outside Wusong Estuary　Firewood Boat Capsized　Three People Drowned　Five People Rescued</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, a firewood boat, fully loaded with firewood from Hupukou, was sailing to Shanghai. When it reached near the Sanjia Water Lighthouse outside the Wusong Estuary, it was overturned by huge waves due to strong winds. All eight crew members and the firewood fell into the river. Three of the eight people soon drowned. The remaining five clung to the overturned bottom of the boat, drifting in the river, shouting for help. At this time, the Jiangding vessel of the German Henglun Shipping Company at No. 293 Sanma Road happened to be sailing nearby and noticed them. It quickly reversed course, and two foreign yachts went to rescue them. The five people were rescued onto the yachts and taken to Shanghai for hospital treatment.</p>
<h3>German Couple　Involved in Lawsuit After Divorce　Woman Sues Husband for Endangering Life　Presents Various Base Acts　Yesterday's Summons, Adjourned for Seven Days for Retrial</h3>
<p>German woman Su Shiluosheng Pankexiaowusi, 30 years old, resides in an apartment at No. 2004 Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, she retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a complaint in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing German Jew Huililuosheng Pank (i.e., Dr. Luo Weilian), (residing in Room Pi-3, Metexis Apartment, No. 934 Jing'an Temple Road) of endangering life, defaming reputation, and other charges. The facts of her prosecution are that the defendant married the plaintiff on December 15, 1934. Subsequently, in November 1938, due to differing opinions, they hired a certifying lawyer and voluntarily divorced, signing a divorce agreement as evidence. However, since the two separated as husband and wife, the defendant has frequently insulted the plaintiff's reputation and disseminated written, false accusations. For example, in the defendant's letter to Mr. Scott on January 11, 1939, he referred to the plaintiff as "a criminal woman who has committed the crime of forging official documents and perjury, and is full of criminal thoughts." In his letter to Dr. Fuhuade (i.e., the certifying lawyer) on January 5, 1939, he referred to the plaintiff as a prostitute, the plaintiff's mother as a madam,</p>
<p>Obscene and Base　Terms and stated, "There is no appropriate word in the world to describe this woman," and the insult, which was close to obscene, included "Other women I have seen are very perfect and interesting when naked, but I have no feeling or pleasure for her." He also referred to the plaintiff as a shameless woman, a dishonorable woman, a shameless wife, stealing gifts, etc., as detailed in his letter to the plaintiff on January 11. It is the defendant's announcement in writing,</p>
<p>To the Utmost of Insult　Is one of the things that damages the plaintiff's reputation. The defendant has been divorced from the plaintiff for a long time, and all the formalities for each other's clothing and other items have long been completed and clear. Unexpectedly, he repeatedly made excuses to harass her in letters, even threatening in a letter on January 11 of this year, limiting her to returning diamond rings, brooches, tablecloths, and other items by 1:00 PM on Saturday. However, these items, except for the tablecloths, were handed over clearly after signing the agreement. The diamond rings, etc., should have been returned by the plaintiff to the defendant's mother, as these items belong to the defendant's mother. Now the defendant is forcing her to hand them over unreasonably, and if he finds even a small item missing, he will</p>
<p>Whip Immediately　And ask God to bless your soul. In his letter to Dr. Fuhuade on January 5, he also threatened in the same way, and said that if the items could not be resolved, he would immediately ask the Shanghai Hong'en Hospital in the West of Shanghai to reserve a bed in a vacant room. Also, in his letter to the plaintiff on November 8 of last year, he specifically notified that he had taken and killed the plaintiff's dog, and pointed out that the dog was the plaintiff herself. His intention was to foreshadow that he would use assassination methods to deal with her. The above all indicate that the defendant has committed the crimes under Articles 305 and 310 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Requesting Severe Punishment　And so on. Upon receiving the complaint, the court was summoned by Judge Zhong yesterday morning. The defendant did not arrive, and lawyer Zhou Chaogang arrived in court, requesting a postponement. The plaintiff, fearing the defendant's vicious methods, arrived in court accompanied by a patrol officer. Her lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang presented the case on her behalf, presenting various evidence to the court. The court ordered a further review in seven days.</p>
<h3>Theft Cases Noted</h3>
<p>Xinzha Road, No. 10 Yanghe Lane, at around 6:45 AM yesterday morning, while the maid of the house was washing utensils in the kitchen, six robbers suddenly rushed into the house, took her down to the lower floor, and were guarded by one robber with a gun. The remaining robbers, led by two robbers with guns, went straight up the chessboard, first waking up the victim and forcing him to hand over important box keys, and began searching. After more than half an hour, they all shouted and fled. After the incident, the victim checked the losses, which amounted to more than 800 yuan, and immediately submitted a detailed list of losses to the police station in charge, requesting pursuit.</p>
<p>No. 11, Xingzhou Hotel, No. 4, Lane 63, Zhejiang Road, was occupied by a group of traveling merchants a few days ago. Unexpectedly, at around 8:15 PM yesterday, three robbers suddenly came to the room under the pretext of visiting. One of the robbers pulled out a handgun and coerced the people in the room, prohibiting them from making noise. At that time, the travelers saw that the robbers were fierce and armed, and they were so frightened that they lost their color. As a result, the robbers did whatever they wanted and searched them. As a result, the more than 6,000 yuan of goods stored by the guests was robbed. After waiting to call for help, the robbers had already left the house and fled. They quickly reported to the police station in charge, requesting pursuit. After receiving the report, the police station immediately ordered detectives to rush to investigate and inquired about the appearance and clothing of the robbers in detail before reporting back for the record. One side searched for clues.</p>
<p>At the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Zhifu Road (commonly known as Stealing Chicken Bridge), at around 5:45 PM yesterday, a passerby was kidnapped by two robbers and forbidden to make noise. They searched him and robbed him of more than 120 yuan in cash before fleeing. At the same time, at the intersection of Avenue Avénue and Jiaozhou Road, a young woman was also stopped by four robbers and robbed of her leather wallet containing 34 yuan in cash. Afterwards, they all reported to the police station in charge, requesting pursuit.</p>
<p>At No. 71 Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road, at 8:00 PM, three robbers suddenly broke in and robbed. One robber with a gun threatened the people in the house, ordering them not to make noise and separating them for detention. The remaining unarmed robbers then scattered to search each room. After about half an hour, they began to withdraw and fired a shot into the sky to show their gratitude before leaving. Fortunately, no one was injured. The victim reported the incident to the police station, requesting pursuit. The losses were huge.</p>
<h3>Group of Suicides　Woman Dies of Untreated Illness</h3>
<p>Addicted to Gambling and Taking Poison　Zhang Liansheng from Yancheng, 41 years old, was working as an accountant in the Meowei Zhai Food Store at No. 122 Hankou Road, Yunnan Road. Recently, Zhang heard that the gambling style in West Shanghai was very popular, and he couldn't help but feel curious. Therefore, after closing the shop every night, he sneaked into the gambling den to place bets, hoping to get lucky. But there can be no intact thing in a tiger's den. Therefore, in less than a few nights, Zhang had lost all his hard-earned savings, and even delayed the store's account of 50 yuan, which he could not repay. With the end of the month approaching, it was impossible to make up for it. In a moment of desperation, fearing that he would be ashamed to face others, he swallowed poison to commit suicide yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM. The incident was discovered by the shop partners, who sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment by car. However, the poisoning was too deep, and the situation was very critical.</p>
<p>Youth Jumps Into River　The Public Concession Nanjing Road Bund Puhua, at 9:40 AM yesterday, a young man was at the location, when no one was prepared. He suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, nearby sampan men tried their best to rescue him and prevented him from drowning. The post police arrived and questioned him, learning that his name was Jin Yirong, 28 years old, and he was tired of the world due to economic pressure. The police then called for an ambulance to take Jin to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Angry at Poisoning　Local man Huang Jinshi, 36 years old, lives at No. 11 Fengyu Lane, Route Say Zo Sé, French Concession. At 12:45 PM yesterday afternoon, in Room 114 of the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, Public Concession, he swallowed medicine to commit suicide behind his back. After the tea servant found out, he urgently called an ambulance and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He died of poisoning. The reason for the suicide was that the couple quarreled and he was angry.</p>

<h3>Foster Child of Zhoupu Xia Clan Pushes Elderly Grandmother, Xia Peiji's Filial Impiety Enrages Neighbors</h3>
<p>The Xia family of Zhoupu has four branches, all with few descendants. Xia Zhu, the wife of the second branch, is seventy-six years old this year. Seventeen years ago, at the urging of her third daughter, she adopted a baby boy from a charitable organization, naming him Peiji. The family treated him like a precious jewel, which gradually led to him becoming spoiled. Ranting, scolding, laziness in studying, and wandering were all daily routines for this child. After August 13th, when they moved to Shanghai, he became even more unruly. Recently, over a minor matter, the grandmother and grandson had a major conflict. As a result, Xia Zhu was pushed and fell by her grandson. Medical treatment revealed internal injuries that are difficult to heal, potentially leading to permanent disability.

<h3>Stomach Disease Maintenance Methods</h3>
<p>— He Shixi</p>
<p>In addition to drug treatment for stomach diseases, efforts should be made to reform the habits that cause the disease. The way to reform is maintenance and food therapy.</p>
<p>The way to maintain stomach diseases can be divided into "personnel" and "dietary."</p>
<p>Personnel: (1) Do not be overly angry, do not worry excessively, do not be depressed and unhappy. (2) Each meal should be at a fixed time. Occasionally, if the time is missed, do not overeat after being overly hungry. (3) The chest and abdomen should be stretched and not compressed. (4) Bowel movements must be smooth every day. (5) The chest and back areas must be kept warm and not exposed to cold. (6) When consulting a doctor for other illnesses, you should inform them of a history of stomach disease, so as to avoid taking other medications that may cause this disease.</p>
<p>Dietary: (1) Balance hunger and satiety. (2) Do not mix oily and cold foods. It is best to eat light and bland meals. (3) Eat less of indigestible foods, such as dry and hard foods, noodles, glutinous rice, raw and cold foods, etc. (4) Chew carefully when eating. (5) Avoid being exposed to wind or heat after eating. (6) You should relax slightly after eating, and do not immediately sit at a desk to work. (7) Avoid sleeping, walking quickly, or engaging in sexual activity immediately after eating. (8) Do not take yang-boosting medicines of metals and stones, or medicines that promote bowel movements. (9) Foods with excessive five flavors - sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty - should not be eaten in large quantities unless specifically permitted by a doctor. (10) Do not take miscellaneous medicines without a doctor's diagnosis.</p>
<h3>Choice of Drug Supplementation and Food Supplementation</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiangren</p>
<p>When a person's body is strong and healthy, able to eat and work, plain vegetables and rice are enough to nourish life and have more than enough. There is no need to use supplements. However, due to accumulated labor leading to deficiency, prolonged illness leading to deficiency, failure to cherish and maintain oneself leading to deficiency, and women having multiple or difficult births leading to deficiency, a strong body inevitably changes to become weak. In a state of weakness, one may be able to eat but not work, or be unable to work and unable to eat. This is what is meant by deficiency. It is impossible to achieve results without supplementation. Generally speaking, those who can eat have strong stomach qi and only need food supplementation. Those who cannot eat have weak stomach qi and must use drug supplementation. Food supplementation is more peaceful but less powerful, while drug supplementation is more powerful but less peaceful. It is often said that drug supplementation is not as good as food supplementation. Drug supplementation takes effect quickly but has more side effects, while food supplementation takes effect slowly but has fewer side effects. However, the main focus of supplements is to protect our spleen and stomach. The taste is mild and balanced, and the properties are pure, with light and powerful ingredients rather than heavy food supplements. Therefore, there are cases where one cannot eat when deficient, but after taking supplements, appetite increases and physical strength gradually recovers. All of this is due to the effect of light and powerful ingredients supplementing the spleen and stomach. If the taste of a medicine is poor, it will easily damage the stomach and is not included in the category of supplements. Those that are yin-nourishing and greasy are no different from rich foods. Although the supplemental power is strong, it is still detrimental to the spleen and stomach. Porridge and rice can nourish people, and foods with blood and meat have great supplemental power. If the stomach can tolerate and digest it, the benefits are ten times that of medicines. But if it cannot be tolerated and is forced down, how is it different from bitter medicines? Therefore, others use supplements with a one-sided belief, while I only take and reject based on what is suitable for my spleen and stomach. If the stomach does not tolerate heavy foods, then supplement with medicines. If the stomach does not tolerate bitter medicines, then supplement with food. The ancient sages said that the stomach loves supplements, and what can be digested can grow. This is the standard for using supplements.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Hemorrhoids and Diet</h3>
<p>— Lin Moyuan</p>
<p>The causes of hemorrhoids are mostly due to not avoiding foods, liking spicy and fried foods, and alcohol. Digestion is difficult, so bowel movements are often constipated. The anus is extremely stimulated, and the veins are subjected to pressure for a long time. Blood stasis accumulates, and tumors are formed into hemorrhoids. In addition, people in the Jiangnan area are mostly damp, and invasion becomes a leak, causing burning, itching, pain, and dripping pus and blood.</p>
<p>Food is the source of nutrition for human life, and selection must be cautious. No matter what kind of suffering, the cause of the disease is absolutely related to ordinary food. As the saying goes, disease enters through the mouth, which is true. As for people with hemorrhoids, they should absolutely abstain from all spicy and irritating foods. Although the condition may not be alleviated, it will not worsen. If you insist on eating spicy and irritating foods, the blood stasis in the anus will be more difficult to circulate, which will inevitably lead to inflammation and swelling, and the condition will increase sharply. Over time, rectal prolapse and bleeding will occur, or even internal invasion of poisonous flames, and the danger will be even greater. People often regard hemorrhoids as a minor disease, so they ignore the diet. Some people know it but cannot restrain themselves from the temporary desire of the mouth and abdomen, which is tantamount to hurting themselves.</p>
<h3>The Ability of Fruits to Treat Diseases</h3>
<p>— He Longsheng</p>
<p>Fruits can help drugs to treat diseases. There are many kinds. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Grapes are rich in iron, so raisins can strengthen teeth and strengthen the stomach. Grape juice can replenish blood and strengthen the body. Pears, eaten raw, clear the heart and moisten the lungs. Pears fried with honey can treat heat cough, phlegm wheezing, clear throat, and lower blood pressure. It is the most common prescription for treating cough. Lotus root, cooked and eaten as juice, can treat cough and hemoptysis. Lotus root joints are an important medicine for ventilation. Hawthorn is an important medicine for digestion. The digestive tablets in Western medicine are made of hawthorn. Yangmei immersed in wine, the longer the year, the more effective it is in treating dysentery. When it's cold and the stove is lit, people's throats often swell and hurt from the heat. If you eat a few pieces of ebony plums, or an orange, or a few olives, every day, you can relieve the heat and stop the pain. Olive juice can relieve puffer fish poison or fishbone obstruction. In addition, lung lobes clear the lungs, and loquats moisten the lungs and resolve phlegm. They are all very effective fruits.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease Recuperation Items</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhensheng</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic disease, so it is not easy to completely recover immediately during treatment. Patients often experience unlimited panic, which causes the disease to progress. In fact, if pulmonary tuberculosis can be properly conditioned and rested peacefully, it can be completely cured. Moreover, drug treatment will double the effect.</p>
<p>The medicines for treating pulmonary tuberculosis are mostly products for nourishing and strengthening vitality. Pulmonary tuberculosis must be cultivated with products to increase its own resistance, and then the disease can be driven out of the body. Therefore, daily food should also be rich in nourishment. In recent years, people have paid more attention to food therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis, which is true. Here are two things I have learned from experience:</p>
<p>Garlic can treat pulmonary tuberculosis, which is recognized by the world. The method is to use several cloves of single garlic (small garlic). Eat one raw every day. If eating raw is not to your taste, then boil and take one. Also prepare some garlic, boil several cloves in a pot every day. When boiling, bow your head and open your mouth, and inhale the steam for half an hour (but those who cannot tolerate the taste can shorten the time slightly).</p>
<p>White ginkgo soaked in oil is also the only nutritious product for treating pulmonary tuberculosis. However, the white ginkgo used in this prescription is not the one sold in the southern goods store, but the white ginkgo picked from the ginkgo tree (without removing the outer skin). Before the Lesser Heat, soak the picked white ginkgo (with the outer flesh) in pure vegetable oil. Only after three years can it be effective. The longer it is stored, the better. When taking it, you can chew the outer flesh together and take it with light salt water. It can nourish the lungs, resolve phlegm, kill bacteria, and relieve cough.</p>
<h3>Changes in Symptoms and Food Therapy Sequence for Typhoid Fever (4)</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>If the fever is mild and you want to drink, you can eat "rice crust soup," also known as pot rice soup, rice skin porridge soup. When there is a fever, only eat this soup. Do not put rice grains into it. Copper pot rice crust that is scorched and black is the best, because it helps the stomach qi and is easy to digest. Rice soup contains nutritional power, but this thing is a flowing liquid, which can nourish the body without stagnating in the stomach. It is the treasure for nourishing the body in typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Wet warm typhoid fever can also be eaten with job's tears tea (i.e. coix seed decoction, only drink the soup), and scorched barley tea. Summer warm typhoid fever can also be drunk with lotus leaf tea. You must also administer it according to the symptoms and seek the doctor's agreement.</p>
<p>Drinking milk during typhoid fever is quite problematic. You must not drink it without the doctor's responsibility.</p>
<p>Plain boiled water is the best drink when you have a fever from typhoid fever. Often drinking it is beneficial for the consumption during fever. Recently, many patients have asked whether they can drink orange juice. Many people can drink this thing, but it must be squeezed and eaten hot. The bridge must be fat and sweet. The small one is sour, and it is not suitable.</p>
<p>If the fever has been lasting for a long time, if the fever is low, you are tired, and you are clear-headed, and you want to eat, you can consider drinking thin lotus root powder soup (you must use real lotus root powder before you can use it. If you use white lotus root powder, it is mostly starch, water chestnut flour, and yam flour, which are not suitable), oatmeal soup (that is, American oatmeal flakes are first fried and then cooked into a thin soup). When eating, use the word "hunger" as the principle, and you cannot seek satiety.</p>
<p>In the second stage of typhoid fever (see January 13 of this newspaper for symptoms), if the fever is raging, according to the doctor's instructions, you can drink snow water boiled tea, watermelon juice, bamboo juice oil, etc. When the mouth is bitter, greasy, tasteless, you can chew green salt tangerine peel, salted olives, green olives, coptis chinensis heads, etc. Change one kind a day, chew the juice, and spit out the residue. This is very important.</p>
<h3>Liver Foods</h3>
<p>— Sun Zonglu</p>
<p>Those suffering from deficiency symptoms, eye diseases, and night blindness, eating pork liver, duck liver, chicken liver, and sheep liver often has the effect of a drumbeat, healing as they eat. Most people with night blindness suffer from malnutrition. After eating liver, they are sufficiently nourished, so they can overcome the disease. Liver creams made by Western medicine, whether taken internally or injected, come in a variety of ways, without end. They are made from animal livers and are good at treating anemia and malnutrition. Pork liver, etc., are very cheap things, and they are very rich in iron. They are readily available in the market and can be eaten as dishes. The taste is fresh and fatty, and it can replenish blood and benefit the body. Although both the poor and the rich can buy them, they are truly natural supplements. For families with children, parents should often make pork liver as a dish. After eating it for a long time, the complexion will be rosy, the spirit will be lively, and the body will be healthy.</p>
<h3>Winter Supplements</h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>Winter is the end of the year, and nourishing the body and supplementing it are most needed. Most of the methods of supplementing seek medicine, so that those who are sick can be cured, and those who are not sick can strengthen their bodies. In addition, they should be supplemented with food.</p>
<p>Modern people regard milk as a common supplement, but when given to those who are overworked or sick, and those with weak spleen and stomach and poor appetite, there may be symptoms such as diarrhea and stagnation. This is because the digestive power of the spleen and stomach has not yet returned to normal. They are given a liquid rich in fat, which cannot be transported and received. As for lamb, it is sweet and hot. It is best for those who are older, have weak bodies, are afraid of the cold in winter, and have impotence and kidney deficiency, and those with cold aversion and stomach upset. However, it is not suitable for young and strong people. Eating too much can easily cause nosebleeds, seminal emission, and body heat. Eggs are the most nutritious food. The white can replenish qi, and the yellow can replenish blood. Boil three or four pieces in water every morning, or use boiling water and boiling milk to eat. Boiling the soup with young chickens can cultivate vitality and strengthen the body. The tonic power is great. (It is even better to use black-bone chicken.) Boiling beef juice and drinking it is also good for warming and tonifying.</p>
<p>The folks pass down that using a pig's trotter, combined with about a pound of longan meat, stewing it in a rice pot for several days until it is rotten, and eating it three or four times in winter is said to have great tonic power, but only those with a good stomach can eat it, because its sweet taste is not very agreeable to the stomach. The pork trotter is sweet and salty, replenishes vitality and blood. After prolonged simmering or boiling, it transforms into a sticky substance. Women who are weak and have no milk, or have thin milk, can eat it to increase milk secretion and make the milk thick. Those who have weakened qi and blood and insufficient vitality, and suffer from external symptoms such as phlegm swelling, which do not heal, can eat more to promote muscle growth and closure. Longan meat is sweet and flat, and can nourish the heart and spleen. It is effective in treating excessive thinking, damage to the heart and spleen from labor, forgetfulness, palpitation, anxiety, insomnia, spontaneous sweating, and palpitations. The ancient prescription has the combination of Guipi Decoction, which is enough to show that eating these two things together is indeed quite beneficial.</p>

<h3>New Theories on Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Zhang Juying</p>
<p>The human body's tissues require food components called nutrients. Broadly speaking, there are five: water, salts, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Although water contains no nutritional components, it occupies the most important position. It is most abundant in blood and digestive fluids, dissolving nutrients, cleansing waste products, and regulating body temperature. Salts contain calcium, which is the main component of bone tissue. Proteins are found in meats such as pork liver and kidneys, eggs contain albumin and vitellin, and grains such as wheat contain gluten, barley contains hordein, and peas and soybeans all contain plant proteins, which are the main components of living cells and can differentiate to produce body heat and energy. Fats are found in large quantities in meats and legumes, such as butter, lard, soybean oil, peanut oil, and coconut oil, and are the body's main fuel. They generate energy when consumed within cells. Carbohydrates are the chemical names for starches and sugars. Potatoes and grains contain starch, while grapes and sugarcane contain sugar. These are all major nutritional components for the human body, providing the foundation for body heat and energy. In addition, there are three components in food called vitamins, which are suitable for the body's nourishment and maintain human health. First, vitamin A, which can dissolve in fats, is most abundant in cod liver oil, butter, and egg yolks, and also abundant in spinach and carrots. It is essential for the growth of young children, hence its name as the growth vitamin. Without it, malnutrition, developmental delays, and rickets can occur. Second, vitamin B, which can dissolve in water, is abundant in brown rice, wheat, beans, spinach, carrots, potatoes, and milk. White rice contains none. A lack of this substance in food can cause beriberi. Patients can be treated with it, hence its name as the anti-beriberi vitamin. Third, vitamin C, which can dissolve in water, is found in lettuce and oranges. It is particularly effective in preventing and treating scurvy, hence its name as the anti-scurvy vitamin. To maintain life and health, we need a certain amount of nutrients, called health food. The amount of nutrients needed varies depending on gender, age, occupation, and climate. Generally, adults need the most protein per day, followed by carbohydrates, and the least fat. Infants rely solely on human milk for growth, and must eat mixed foods after two years of age. For example, rice contains a lot of starch and little protein, while eggs are rich in protein and lack starch. No matter what kind of food, eating only one kind cannot nourish the body or maintain health. The composition of food should be properly matched so that there is no excess or deficiency of any nutrient, which is hygienic. In general, when the human body lacks a certain component, it craves that thing. Conversely, it is disgusted and does not want to eat it.</p>

<h3>Did Scholar Wu Really Go to Liangshan?</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>According to the Tongmeng News Agency, Scholar Wu has already gone to Liangshan; however, according to other telegraphic news, Scholar Wu has not yet gone to Liangshan, so whether Scholar Wu went to Liangshan or not remains a mystery in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>Scholar Wu's life and career have not had enough to make people prostrate themselves in admiration, but his integrity and unwillingness to submit to any party or person are indeed admirable. Since his defeat, he has been unwilling to take shelter under the power of outsiders, unwilling to live in the concessions, and willing to live in the old capital, reading and cultivating his ambitions. This kind of spirit is indeed extraordinary, so from this point of view, Scholar Wu will definitely not go to Liangshan.</p>
<p>However, Scholar Wu is now in the occupied old capital, under the power of the Japanese. How can he withstand their daily temptations, threats, coaxing, and deceptions? It is probably not easy to preserve his chastity. Moreover, the Japanese are now at their wit's end and have no choice but to do something drastic, which is not impossible. Therefore, it is also possible that Scholar Wu will go to Liangshan.</p>
<p>However, given Scholar Wu's current situation, there are probably only two paths he can take: one is to go to Liangshan, and the other is not to go to Liangshan, but to walk the path of the long night. If Scholar Wu goes to the path of the long night, he will become a perfect person, but if Scholar Wu really goes to Liangshan, it is not a strange or remarkable thing. Scholar Wu's strength lies in his integrity. If he goes to Liangshan, then Scholar Wu's integrity will be gone with the wind, and he will just be a walking corpse, a puppet, like Black Whirlwind Li Kui, Featherless Arrow Zhang Qing, etc., and become a member of the Liangshan gang. What does it have to do with the overall situation?</p>
<h3>Introduction Shops in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>People in Shanghai can be broadly divided into two categories: those who are employed and those who employ others; however, even among those who are employed or employ others, there are differences in class and situation. It is even possible for someone to be employed by others while also employing others, or for someone who employs others to also be employed by others. Such interconnected relationships, I think, cannot be understood by a simple explanation.</p>
<p>The relationship between employment and being employed is constantly taking place in Shanghai, which is why special businesses such as employment agencies and introduction shops have been established. However, employment agencies that introduce legitimate professions have yet to be found; although there have been a few speculative employment agencies in the past, they were merely scams. As for those that introduce amahs, maids, and nannies, they are the so-called introduction shops. Introduction shops can be roughly divided into three groups: Suzhou, Shaoxing, and Yangzhou. They mostly operate in the northern part of the concession, such as North Zhejiang Road, Keneng Hai Road, Kaifeng Road, Haining Road, and Avenue Edward VII. There are also a few south of the Old Rubbish Bridge. In the past, we could see many introduction shops with signs like "Gusu Old Wang's Introduction Shop," "Shaoxing Old Zhang's Introduction Shop," and "Yangzhou Old [Surname]'s Introduction Shop" simply by taking a walk on those roads. And in those introduction shops, there were always many old women or women sitting and waiting to be hired by someone.</p>
<p>The organization of introduction shops is very simple. They do not need a lot of capital or magnificent decorations. They only need to rent a street-front shop, buy some necessary furniture, and hang up a sign for the introduction shop to be successful. However, some also prepare a mezzanine floor so that those who have just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside and have no relatives to stay with can stay for a night, but they also have to pay some rent for the night. During the day, they put a few benches in front of the door for those waiting to be hired to sit there and wait for employers.</p>
<p>But the owners of introduction shops must also have connections. It is not possible without connections. For example, one group is familiar with the ways of one group. Their footsteps are almost always in several mansions or large families; and each family has its own old customers. The amah, maid, or nanny who enters or leaves that mansion or that large family must be recommended by a certain introduction shop. In addition, naturally, there are also those who go to the introduction shop to call for themselves.</p>
<p>When the introduction shop sends the person to be hired, the employer has to pay the person who sent them some travel expenses, but there is a trial period of three days. If they are not satisfied during the trial period, they can ask the introduction shop to send another person. However, there are also mansions that notify the introduction shop in advance of what kind of person they want to hire, and then let the introduction shop find them.</p>
<p>I have already said in the previous article that there are originally three groups of introduction shops in Shanghai. Among these three groups, each has its own business channels. For example, employers of the Suzhou group usually go to the Suzhou group's introduction shops to find servants. At the same time, those Su-style job seekers who go to introduction shops will, of course, go to the Suzhou group's introduction shops. Therefore, they are naturally distinct from each other, but there are also exceptions, because sometimes Suzhou employers prefer to hire a Shaoxing amah, or a local employer wants to hire a Suzhou nanny, etc. But this situation is ultimately a minority, perhaps because hiring compatriots can reduce some linguistic and habitual barriers.</p>
<p>A woman, because she cannot live in her hometown or at home, has to come to Shanghai to find something to do. However, because she has no knowledge or specialized skills, the only way out is to help others; if she has acquaintances in Shanghai, she can ask them to find a way to introduce her. If she has no acquaintances, she has no choice but to go to an introduction shop; but introduction shops also have rules that they do not recommend without relatives, friends, or guarantors, so to be introduced, one must first have a guarantor.</p>
<p>After the introduction shop has properly introduced a servant and agreed on the salary, they have a regulation that 20% or 30% of the monthly salary earned by the hired person must be deducted as the introduction shop's commission, for a period of three months to six months.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, introduction shops were once extremely prosperous, but now, job seekers are often introduced by relatives and friends, and employers hire directly. Therefore, the fate of introduction shops has also plummeted and is unbearable to look back on.</p>
<h3>A Hundred Bushels of Bright Pearls</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Rich Man, Poor Girl"</p>
<p>A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>Every day when I open the society page of the newspaper, "news" about marriage problems accounts for a very large proportion, and these marriage disputes are mostly caused by the disparity between the rich and the poor. A "rich young master," under a momentary "whim," falls in love with a "girl from a humble family" and "marries" her; but behind this "joyful" scene, the result of a "tragedy" is already lurking. One is that the wealthy person is simply holding a "playful" attitude, relying on the magic of money to play with ordinary women as a pleasure; the other is that in this unreasonable society, people look at this "marriage" with strange eyes, relentlessly jealous and sarcastic, and finally brew a tragedy before feeling satisfied.</p>
<p>"A Hundred Bushels of Bright Pearls," as the original name "Rich Man, Poor Girl" indicates, the union of Bill and Joan went through so many twists and turns because of the "disparity between rich and poor." It is naturally good to make a movie with such a theme, but the playwright does not strengthen Bill's final actions to forcefully clarify and make Henry trust in the union of this "marriage." And the farce of Bill's sister Sally coming out to file a fake lawsuit weakens the power of the theme.</p>
<p>This play introduces a total of eight characters, in addition to Bill and Joan, there are Joan's father, mother, younger sister Helen, younger brother Frank, and Joan's cousin Henry. It can be said that the director has portrayed the personalities of these eight characters very vividly, especially Helen and Henry. Henry is "stubborn and rigid, despising money and advocating the theory of the 'great middle class' all day long"; Helen is "longing for the decadent life of wealth and ease." The director writes these two characters like this: writing Henry's dissatisfaction with Bill, such as when Bill stepped into Joan's family, he debated with Bill; Henry found a job, but knew that it was Bill who secretly recommended him, and even left the lively dance party without saying goodbye. Writing Helen is like this: Helen curls her hair and puts on powder before she knows Bill is coming; the director writes the characters of the two in opening the door to greet Bill with awkwardness, and the final cry, so powerfully.</p>
<p>Although the whole play is set in Joan's family, it is not dry and boring, and many scenes are lively and humorous, which must also be attributed to the director. For example, Joan explains her engagement to Bill, Bill is about to arrive, the family cleans up the tableware and dresses up; Helen's fiancé suddenly breaks in during the family conversation; Bill spends the night at Joan's house, the broken sofa creaks frequently, mosquitoes and flies harass, and music is playing outside, etc. These scenes are very interesting.</p>
<p>Finally, Bill disappears, and the director grasps the atmosphere of the family's anxiety very firmly.</p>
<p>Among the small films, "A Hundred Bushels of Bright Pearls" is still a superior work.</p>

<h3>The Crowd Entering and Leaving Hongqiao Road</h3>
<p>— Sifang</p>
<p>The long and flat Hongqiao Road, before the war, was usually lying quietly, except for the occasional car passing by, raising the dust on the side of the road and making the roar of the horn.</p>
<p>But now Hongqiao Road has become a bustling thoroughfare. The entrance of the barbed wire fence is like opening a giant mouth, every day, spitting out many people from the isolated island to the countryside, and every day, swallowing many people from the countryside. The crowd that is swallowed and spit out is mostly simple villagers.</p>
<p>Sweating profusely and panting, they carry vegetables, firewood, flowers, and other things to the isolated island to sell, providing the people on the isolated island with fresh vegetables, fuel, clean offerings for the desk, and so on.</p>
<p>Villagers selling firewood and rice mostly come out in the morning, sell it and go back in the afternoon, while vegetables, flowers, and other things come out in the evening, because these things are to be sold every morning.</p>
<p>When we enjoy those things, we don't think of the tears of the simple villagers who carry them out.</p>
<p>I once inquired with a villager selling firewood.</p>
<p>It costs three yuan a month to get a pass, and a dime for a load of things when it is carried through the entrance. The intangible cost is at least two dimes a day. It costs money to buy food, and it also costs money to stay overnight.</p>
<p>"Sir! This is our business, and we have to add physical strength and foot strength.</p>
<p>The villagers entering and leaving Hongqiao Road are carrying a heavy and melancholy heart.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Admiring the Portrait to Remember the Old Patriot, Asking the Illiterate to Learn Characters from the Little Teacher</p>
<p>There is a small patch of grass around, surrounded by iron chains. People often like to take pictures next to the iron chains. Today, there are quite a few people coming in and out of this museum. Because Miss Jin often comes here, she is very familiar with what items are displayed in each room, so she can guide and point out everything. Each commemorative item has a brief description, but they don't even bother to look at it closely. Later, they were led to a place where a framed, enlarged photo was hanging. Miss Jin said to the two Miss He, "This is my father's portrait." When they looked at it, it was indeed a military officer in uniform. But the appearance was not very stern. After saying it, Jin Danyun's face was somewhat like her father's. Obviously, this Brigadier General Jin was a scholar-general. At this time, the He sisters quickly stood in awe and bowed to the photo in salute. He Liyu said, "We must also offer another bouquet of flowers before General Jin's portrait." Jin Danyun said, "Thank you! The two sisters have already offered flowers at the grave just now." The museum is a three-story building, even just taking a quick look at each room already takes up a lot of time. After walking out of the museum, the library is next to it. Miss Jin said, "I can say that this library is not worth seeing. Let's just go there and take a look." They walked into the library. Although the library building is not large, the reading room is very spacious. Inside, there were all kinds of people reading books and newspapers. Some were students, some were tourists, some were old men, and some were children. The two He sisters had also been to many foreign libraries when they were abroad, and they found them to be very clean and tidy. There were also some science libraries, which were all people with knowledge who went in to read. They had never seen such a small library before. Although Miss Jin said that it was not worth seeing, they were moved by curiosity and wanted to go in and take a look. The two He sisters walked to a row on that side, and there was an old man and a child sitting side by side. The old man was about fifty years old, and his hair was already gray. The child was about ten years old, wearing a school uniform, clearly a primary school student. They seemed to be looking at a book together, and the primary school student was gesticulating as if he was explaining it to the old man. The two He sisters wanted to know what book they were reading, so they quietly walked behind them. They only saw that it was a magazine, and the cover had the words "Agricultural Knowledge" written on it. Because there were many people in the library, even if someone noticed them, they didn't feel it. (29)</p>

<h3>A Sense of Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>— Moxie</p>
<p>This is one right, that is one right, right and wrong are originally difficult to determine. Some people even say that right is wrong, and wrong is right, because what is right here may be wrong there, and vice versa, what is wrong there may be right here. White and slender women are considered beautiful by most civilized countries, but in Africa, black, fat, and short women are considered the ultimate in beauty. There are countless other examples, of course.</p>
<p>Because each is right in its own way, and each is wrong in its own way, and because they cannot agree on what is right and wrong, disputes, quarrels, and even fights occur between individuals, and protests, diplomatic breaks, and even wars occur between countries. Arguing over some right and wrong leads to "trouble."</p>
<p>But is there really no absolute standard for right and wrong? Not necessarily, there are standards after all. Taking beauty and ugliness as an example, loving beauty and hating ugliness is a consistent right, although the standards of beauty and ugliness are different. Furthermore, from ancient times to the present, from China to abroad, there are also many unchanging truths that have defined the scope of right and wrong, as unbreakable as people eating rice and dogs eating feces. The so-called unchanging truths include: benevolence, righteousness, trustworthiness, peace, justice, ... etc. No one dares to say, or will say, that these virtues are bad, are "wrong," and should not be developed but eradicated by us humans.</p>
<p>However, "smart people" - in fact, shameless people - have the ability to distort facts and reverse right and wrong. They say that invasion is goodwill. They say that killing, arson, rape, looting, and doing everything are punishing the people and saving them from fire and water. They say that monopoly and hegemony are maintaining common interests and opening doors. They say that asking others to be their slaves and be used by them is being their friends and sharing prosperity. ... In short, they clearly know what is right and what is wrong, but they do not hesitate to make wrong right and right wrong, and they want others to be as unclear about right and wrong as they are, and to officially follow their right and wrong.</p>
<p>I think, if they continue to make trouble like this, maybe one day it will become a habit, their conscience will be wiped out, and they will truly recognize wrong as right and right as wrong. Therefore, if we want to eat rice, maybe they will say that rice cannot be eaten, we should eat feces, or they will say that feces are rice, or they will say that they have always eaten feces and will continue to eat feces in the future.</p>
<p>Recently, it is said that these troublemakers are everywhere drumming their tongues like a meal, reversing black and white, and especially publicizing their heresies, wanting us to "cooperate" with them and take their right and wrong as our right and wrong. I think, "Everyone has a sense of right and wrong, we may not be fooled by them. I say, 'Those who have no sense of right and wrong are not human!'" Those who echo heresies will become people who do not eat rice and become dogs who eat feces!</p>
<h3>"A Quick Temper Meets a Slow Doctor."</h3>
<p>— Ye Huo</p>
<h3>Paper Marks</h3>
<p>— Ye Yin</p>
<p>The red and green waves of light filling the city streets had already made the heart of Gardener Er, who had suddenly fallen into the sea of people, beat non-stop, not to mention the valuable thing he had with him.</p>
<p>Yes, Gardener Er was full of joy. It could be said that he had never been so happy before. Even when he was a child, sleeping in his mother's arms all day long, he didn't feel so comfortable; this was simply a miracle in his life: a thousand marks, my God, how much Chinese money would that be worth?</p>
<p>He still remembered the horror of that night. That night, he was lying in bed, drowsily falling asleep, when suddenly there was shouting outside the door, and the sound of footsteps didn't seem to be from one person. Finally, the door was opened. Soon, he was dragged out of the quilt like a chick, tied with straw ropes, and led outside. At the same time, there were already many people tied up.</p>
<p>No one could predict whether they would see the sun the next day; but unexpectedly, they were sent to a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>But the shadow of the whip shone behind everyone's heads, and everyone had to lower their heads and mechanically move with the rake, letting sweat drip to the tip of their noses. The blood in their hearts, however, was running frantically.</p>
<p>Finally, the trench was dug into a winding line, and they understood that they were holding the butcher's knife and personally slaughtering their own brothers. They temporarily succumbed to the curse of the whip.</p>
<p>On the day of completion, joy was evident on those flushed faces. They heard everyone's tired moans and couldn't help but smile ferociously.</p>
<p>Then they mysteriously distributed some colorful pieces of paper, and he was also given one. Then he heard the words of that × traitor:</p>
<p>"×× never stints on people who do things. Now, you are free again. The colorful things you have in your hands are German notes - mark notes, with a large amount: one thousand yuan, so I say ×× people will not stint on people."</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn't completely believe it, and his face showed suspicion. But that person spoke again:</p>
<p>"Once you get to Shanghai, you can ask the small money shops to exchange it. Exchange, do you understand; exchange means exchanging for Chinese money..."</p>
<p>Gardener Er's mind was filled with all kinds of fantasies. He had previously tried to find a way to work as a gardener for foreigners, and now maybe he was in luck, using a lot of foreign money.</p>
<p>He arrived in Shanghai like this: the city streets were so bustling. He thought for a long time, and then regained his composure before realizing that he was still standing on the road.</p>
<p>Go exchange it, he urgently needed some money. He had already used his meager money for travel expenses, and because he had a large sum of money on him, he spent it more generously.</p>
<p>So, he went to find the money shop to exchange it.</p>
<p>He had asked people, and they had pointed him in the direction. He came to a shop that didn't look very much like one with trepidation.</p>
<p>He carefully looked at it several times, hesitatingly walked back and forth. Finally, he decided, he stepped forward:</p>
<p>"Sir! Is this a money shop that exchanges money?"</p>
<p>The man with glasses showed a disdainful expression on his face and only hummed an "um" through his nose.</p>
<p>Gardener Er couldn't help but feel overjoyed. He began to fumble. His slow hands and feet made him even more annoying. He finally fumbled out a paper package. He carefully opened it, removed several layers of newspaper, and presented the colorful banknote that was like his life.</p>
<p>The man with glasses pinched the colorful paper with two fingers:</p>
<p>"Paper mark."</p>
<p>"That's right, it's a mark, I even forgot the name."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"They said it's worth a thousand yuan."</p>
<p>"Hum! It used to be a thousand marks, now it's not worth a penny."</p>
<p>The man with glasses threw the colorful banknote on the glass counter and turned his head.</p>
<p>Gardener Er looked blankly at the man. Suddenly, everything went black before his eyes, and the surrounding scenery changed abruptly.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>—— Folk Novel Commentary</p>
<p>This book was written by Jiang Risheng in the early Qing Dynasty, chronicling the story of Zheng Chenggong and his descendants. It begins with a preface by Chen Qiyong of Minyuan, dated Jia Shen of the Kangxi era, and a "Genealogy of the Zheng Clan." There are original editions by the Qiu Wu Bu Huo Studio, typeset editions by the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper, and lithographic editions in the "Comprehensive Collection of Notes and Novels" published by the Civilization Bureau. It comprises thirty volumes. Each volume is prefaced with a seven-character couplet, suggesting each volume is treated as a chapter. This is the only chaptered novel included in the "Comprehensive Collection of Notes and Novels." Strictly speaking, if the seven-character couplets are removed, this book would not be significantly different from ordinary classical Chinese notes like "Qie Fen Lu."</p>
<p>Given that it is a work from the early Qing Dynasty, perhaps to avoid falling foul of censorship, the writer of the preface inevitably displays a tendency to favor the alien race: "Chenggong, bestowed the imperial surname by Longwu, fled overseas, upholding the defunct dynasty for thirty-seven years, upholding righteousness and maintaining integrity, almost a legacy of Tian Heng. Yet, from the perspective of our dynasty, he was merely a wandering spirit of the vanquished state, a desperate soul in a remote corner of the sea, guilty of border incursions and resisting transformation—what more can be said! Respectfully, our Emperor's divine accomplishments and sagely brilliance surpass all ages; Zheng's rebellion was suppressed, his submission was embraced. Furthermore, His Majesty's boundless benevolence and extraordinary leniency have culminated in the unified rule of China and the outside world, with an enduring foundation established for myriad years." I believe that even under environmental pressure, such words exceed the bounds of tolerance. It seems these words were not spoken out of necessity, but rather contain an element of flattery and ingratiation. In this case, there is no basis for defending Chen Qiyong.</p>
<p>Jiang Risheng was a native of Fujian. As a Fujianese writing about Fujian affairs, he naturally had access to many materials unknown to people from other provinces. The recent "Ming Yanping Prince's Taiwan Maritime Kingdom Chronicle" by Yu Zongxin utilized this book as one of its important sources.</p>
<p>This book takes Zheng Chenggong and his descendants as its main thread, and the turmoil at the end of the Ming Dynasty as its secondary thread. Notable examples include volume four, which describes Emperor Chongzhen's suicide at Coal Hill, and volume five, which describes "Huang Daozhou's heroic death in Nanjing."</p>
<p>The section on Zheng Chenggong only covers volumes six to twelve. Among these seven volumes, only volumes ten to twelve are relatively engaging. Because it is written in classical Chinese and lacks imaginative richness, there are few points of merit. Even the relatively well-depicted Gan Hui fails to display his personality. However, this book seems slightly better than "Seven Peaks' Remaining Writings."</p>
<p>Jiang Risheng's attitude is the same as that of the preface writer. For example, volume six states: "Chenggong led Lin Xishan, Gan Hui, and others to attack Tong'an," and "The bandit forces were vast." Referring to Zheng Chenggong as a bandit, his attempt to recover lost territory is considered a border invasion by bandits. Volume ten states: "Liang Huafeng, because the sea bandits directly entered Gua Zhen, detoured to Jiangnan." Even the third-person perspective refers to Zheng Chenggong as a sea bandit, which is a regrettable oversight. However, the author does not excessively insult Zheng Chenggong, and some even say the author "implied a subtle sense of sorrow," which is somewhat comforting.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Just as they were arguing and speculating in this manner, the elementary school principal, Lu Yaojin, silently stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the map of China hanging on the left-hand wall. After a while, he pointed to a spot on the map with one finger, turned around, and exclaimed with great delight:</p>
<p>"Found it! It's here, it's here!"</p>
<p>His exclamation caused everyone in the hall to gather around to look. Cai Hefeng drew a line on the map with his finger and said triumphantly:</p>
<p>"Didn't I say it was in Pudong? This winding black line is the Huangpu River. Although Jinshanwei is below, from the map's orientation, it's still on the east side. So, Punan can also be said to be Pudong."</p>
<p>Yang Yueliang ignored his smugness, reached out to adjust his reading glasses on his nose, and suddenly exclaimed in surprise:</p>
<p>"What's this? Hangzhou Bay? Could it be that the × army is attacking Hangzhou again?"</p>
<p>"No, Hangzhou Bay is far from Hangzhou." Lu Yaojin shook his head repeatedly, saying, "They're definitely not going to attack Hangzhou. They're outflanking Shanghai's rear. Look, from Jinshanwei going north, across the Huangpu River, isn't that Shanghai?"</p>
<p>This statement caused everyone to nod in agreement. In any case, the war had not yet posed a direct threat to them, so their conversation carried an indifferent tone. No one noticed that as they gathered around the map to discuss, a young military officer in a serge uniform and an elderly gentleman with graying hair quietly entered the hall. It was Chen, the town mayor, who was quick to notice, and he immediately reminded everyone:</p>
<p>"Commander Ye and Elder Ye have arrived."</p>
<p>His words were met with a burst of cheers as everyone rushed forward to show their courtesy, surrounding Commander Ye and Elder Ye, making it impossible to get through. Elder Ye recognized most of the accompanying guests, nodding to them while introducing them one by one to Commander Ye.</p>
<p>"Please, have a seat! Please, have a seat!" Mayor Chen personally dusted the chair at the head of the table, and the other guests also realized that they were blocking the way, so they quickly made way. Elder Ye initially declined, unwilling to sit in the head chair, but eventually gave in to the urging of the crowd and reluctantly sat down. However, Commander Ye ultimately sat in the next chair down.</p>
<p>"Why so early?" Director Yang Yueliang asked, his face full of smiles, as he and Elder Ye got along very well usually.</p>
<p>Elder Ye placed his ever-present water pipe on the Eight Immortals table, coughed, and pointed to Commander Ye, saying: (3)</p>

<h3>Discussing Spoken Drama and Modern Drama – Starting with Ye Qiuxin</h3>
<p>— Bing Du</p>
<p>Thoughts After Seeing "This Grief Knows No End"</p>
<p>Following Xia Peizhen, Bai Hong, and Wang Hanlun, Ye Qiuxin has also jumped out of the film circle and into the ranks of spoken drama.</p>
<p>In order to compare the strengths and weaknesses of spoken drama and modern drama, I went with Brother Bai Zi to see Qiuxin's first evening performance on stage, "This Grief Knows No End."</p>
<p>The Trick of Tian Yun Lou</p>
<p>If it can be considered news, the advertisements of "Model Beauty of 1939" and "A World-Famous Movie Star" were indeed specially arranged on the elevator of Tian Yun Lou for Ye Qiuxin. The arrangements on stage, such as flower baskets and silver screens, were also naturally refreshed, indicating the importance Tian Yun Lou attached to Ye Qiuxin.</p>
<p>Spoken Drama is Not Easy to Perform</p>
<p>However, "This Grief Knows No End" is a tragedy. Throughout the play, Ye Qiuxin played the main character, Wang Shan. But as a film practitioner who suddenly left directing and lacked stage experience, stepping onto the spoken drama stage for the first time and acting alongside spoken drama actors who made a living from it, she appeared stiff in her movements and awkward in her language.</p>
<p>The Script is Not Depraved</p>
<p>It should be said that in the dramatic movement, spoken drama has its own indestructible reasons. In this play, I felt that there were several points that were almost beyond our expectations. First, we should pay tribute to the playwright of "This Grief Knows No End." He also had a forward-looking mind and bold shouts, such as exposing the ugliness of noble families, reflecting the evils of materialism, denouncing the mistakes of feudal marriages, and satirizing the shamelessness of lawyers and police officers. The insertion of humorous material, such as the character of Wang's Sister-in-Law, is especially typical of the lower-middle class. The illustration of the landlord is also very realistic. We cannot say it is depraved. At the very least, we can say that most of it is revolutionary and educational enough. What should be improved are some excessive actions, redundant lines, and obscene dialogues. If the toxins can be completely removed or the theme emphasized, the audience of spoken drama will definitely remain broader and more powerful than the audience of modern drama, which is only built on a small-bourgeois intellectual class.</p>
<p>Qiuxin Should Learn More</p>
<p>Among the actors, the ones playing Wang's Sister-in-Law and the concubine are the most lovable. Their acting skills are completely performed with bold strokes, so realistic and intimate. Qiuxin forgot that this was a spoken drama stage. She was essentially mute, unable to speak in a flat manner. In three dimensions, she had no full-body movements. Leaving the screen, her small, localized movements naturally became like sacrificial decorations on stage. From this, I seem to believe that performing spoken drama is by no means depraved, as long as there is determination to improve. However, Ye Qiuxin, at present, should first put in a lot of solid learning!</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Life</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>Since the advent of radio stations, it has indeed opened up a new path for all kinds of people in the entertainment industry. In addition to venues and private performances, there is now an extra source of income from radio stations. Some even rely on radio stations for their livelihood. In recent years, radio stations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Almost every household has a radio. People can sit at home behind closed doors and listen to various songs in nine styles and eighteen tones without spending a penny. They can listen to whatever they want. As long as the machine is turned on, it will emit a croaking sound. Wealthy people are so happy. However, the life of a broadcaster is unspeakably bitter. Outsiders think that the life of a broadcaster is so carefree. For forty minutes, all you have to do is open your mouth, and legal tender will be delivered to your door. In fact, the suffering in this is simply not to be spoken of to outsiders. The so-called "watching others carry burdens without feeling tired," I am also one of these people. Now I will write about the life of a broadcaster to report to the listeners who love to listen to the radio.</p>
<p>The first step in a broadcaster's life is to attract advertisements. This depends entirely on the broadcaster's fame and their usual social skills and agility. Speaking of soliciting advertisements, it is indeed the most difficult thing. Some people are given package deals, and some do not like broadcasting. Unless you are truly famous (i.e., a well-known brand), someone will ask for advice. Otherwise, it is difficult to solicit advertisements by going to people's doorsteps. The so-called "warm face looking at a cold face," but for the sake of livelihood, one has no choice but to endure adversity. If you are lucky and have a chance, you may be able to make a deal. However, nine out of ten times it will not work, and most of the time, you have to rely on friends to introduce you and exchange favors. If you broadcast well, you can continue. If you broadcast poorly, it will be the end of the line. There are two types of broadcasting: exclusive broadcasting and joint broadcasting. Most of them are joint broadcasting. As for broadcasting fees, there is a big difference. In the past, income was still good, but since the war started, business has been difficult. There are more and more broadcasters every day, squeezing each other and cutting prices. As long as you touch your grandmother, she is your mother. As a result, both sides are hurt and the situation is extremely miserable. Some people even broadcast for five yuan a month. This is self-destruction, and it can also be called a black sheep. The reason is that broadcasters lack unity. Some broadcasters also run the streets, the so-called "package programs," but after going through the hands of a runner, the profits are divided, and they do not get any benefits. Therefore, it is more worthwhile to solicit advertisements yourself.</p>
<p>After a broadcaster has finally accumulated advertisements, the second step is to find a radio station and buy time slots, which can be difficult again. Radio stations come in different sizes, and time slots are good and bad. The big radio stations and good time slots are so expensive that you want to cry. If you don't understand business, don't even think about getting on the air. Moreover, they are full of customers. Even if you pay a high price, you can't buy a time slot. They are rare goods to be hoarded, with a hideous and terrifying capitalist face that makes people shy away. On the store side, of course, the bigger the radio station, the better. But to ask them to pay a considerable price is impossible. A broadcaster who wants to save face would rather endure the pain of sacrifice, even to the point of digging into their own pockets. The so-called "dying to save face and suffering alive." But then again, the boss of the radio station especially likes to praise famous brands. As long as you are willing to go, they are willing to let you broadcast even if you don't pay the airtime fee, because they think that if a radio station has a famous brand, there will be more listeners. However, once the radio station becomes strong, then no matter if you are the number one brand, they will charge you the airtime fee. In the end, most broadcasters are doing business for the radio station, like tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>After much effort, finally opening a stall (i.e., buying a time slot, called "opening a stall"), of course, you have to spend money to eliminate disasters. You open your mouth and shout until your throat is hoarse, like a hawker on Shilu Road, or a candy seller on a streetcar. You are loyal and devoted, doing your best until you die to promote it. In the broadcaster's mind, they are the provider of food and clothing, and they dare not neglect it. But there are always unforgiving listeners who will not hesitate to spend three cents on a phone call to the radio station to ask questions, saying that the report is too verbose. It seems that having a radio gives them the authority to monitor the broadcaster, which is really infuriating.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (94)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Amateur performers are not necessarily without real talent. In the past, the Jing actors Huang Runfu, Liu Yongchun, and Jin Youshan were all famous Zheng Jing (main painted-face role) and Fu Jing (secondary painted-face role) actors of their time. However, the three of them had different teachers, so their performance styles also differed from each other after they mastered their craft. Today, most of the actors who sing Hua Lian (painted-face roles) all follow the styles of the aforementioned three, but relatively few people study the style of Liu Yongchun. One reason is that Zheng Jing is the most difficult to perform, and the second reason is that Yongchun lived in Shanghai for many years in his later years and took his son, Xiao Heng, to perform in places like Yantai and Harbin. Therefore, people in the former capital gradually forgot the name Liu Chun (Liu Chun was his real name). Huang Sanben was a servant in the Imperial Household Department. At that time, the Southern Troupe was under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Department, so he saw many famous actors. He had a good talent, so he often performed a few plays for fun. Later, he was dismissed from his post for performing as an amateur, so he simply became a student of Qing Si (named Chunpu, who was praised as having equal beauty with Cheng Changgeng in performances in the palace) and went into the professional world. At that time, there was a Ye Zhongding who specialized in treacherous hero roles and was very popular with the audience. Huang San thought that his voice was not very suitable for the Zheng Jing style and was not as good as He Guishan, whose voice was like gold and stone. So he focused on studying treacherous hero plays such as "Wancheng," "Three Beats," "Down the Hedong River," and "Yangping Pass." Later, he actually earned the nickname of "Living Cao Cao." In his later years, he simply did not sing any play other than Cao Cao's plays. Therefore, the six characters "Living Cao Cao Huang Runfu" became well known to everyone. In fact, he also performed Jiao Zan, Meng Liang, Niu Gao, Zhang Fei, etc., very well, especially his portrayal of Huang Gai in "Heroes' Meeting," which was truly amazing and unique. When Huang Gai was punished, he had a long passage of rapid-fire lyrics that were difficult to sing, but Huang San sang it with many good melodies. Now, let me write down that lost old lyrics. I am afraid that Hao Shuchen, who claims to be a descendant of the Huang school, may not even have retained this passage.</p>

<h3>Crying Down the Great Wall in the Midst of Storms</h3>
<p>— Ruo Mei</p>
<p>Mingxing Film Company's first costume film "Meng Jiangnu" will be screened today at the Jincheng Grand Theatre. "Meng Jiangnu" is a long-standing folk tale with a full sense of social consciousness. After being adapted by Wu Cun according to his recent successful work "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" and actively targeting reality, it sweeps away old mistakes and weaknesses, making people not only sympathize with Meng Jiangnu's chastity, but also witness Wan Xiliang as a heroic patriot. We firmly believe that China now needs this kind of film, and even more so needs the patriots and virtuous women portrayed in this film.</p>
<p>The script's structure and consciousness are as described above. In terms of art and technology, it also has lofty and indelible traces. In terms of acting, Zhou Xuan is naturally uniquely lovely. Performances such as the secret meeting in the West Chamber, self-consideration under the lamp, farewell at the long pavilion, assassination of the thief in the ancient castle, as well as crying at the city and passing the customs, all have extremely accomplished performances. She is a truly red star in the Chinese film industry. In addition, newcomers from the Mingxing Training Institute, such as Xu Feng and Yi Ying, are also very competent. Comedians such as You Guangzhao, Han Langen, and Duan Xiucen all have unexpectedly humorous performances that can make you feel a spicy taste in your laughter.</p>
<p>In the technical part, the first to be mentioned are photography and sound recording. These two have always been the reason why Mingxing Film Company stands at the highest peak of the Chinese film industry. However, in this play, there are even more advanced contributions. For example, photography has shown an emphasis on the effort of time and space. We can feel that this is due to the ability to accurately use many different lens effects. As for the beauty of the composition, that is extra. The sound recording is also very good and meets the standards. In particular, "low-key" has amazing success. For example, the gasping of Meng Jiangnu in the storm. If it were not for the best machinery and the best talent, it would not be possible. The clothing and scenery are also quite exquisite. According to the Yu Cheng Grand Theatre, there were three blockbusters competing for their screening rights on the old New Year's Day, and now "Meng Jiangnu" has been selected. Here, we also think there is reason to, so we dare to recommend it to readers.</p>

<p>Since Diao Banhua joined Yehua, the Wang brothers plan to direct a film each, with Diao Gong starring. It is said that the film directed by Jue Long is a costume historical film "Daji," and the film directed by Yuan Long is a detective film "Shanghai's Four Great Devils." We will wait and see which one comes first. There is a great scene of "Two Dragons Seizing Diao."</p>
<p>The wife of film critic Qian Taisheng, Zhao Zhenni, is currently playing a socialite in Guohua's new film "Hongfen Piao Ling (Drifting Rouge)," although it is her debut, her acting is very good.</p>
<p>Wang Yin has recently been spending his days in Xinya teahouse, and it is said that he will be engaged in writing a film script. In the future, he will definitely change his style and work hard on writing, the reason being that he has no plays to film within half a year.</p>
<p>Following "Mulan Joins the Army," Southern film queen Chen Lingshang's new film is "Cloud Dress Fairy," currently Yue Feng is rushing to write it day and night, it may be released and filmed at the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>Since returning to Shanghai from Kunming, Jianong has now joined Guohua and is playing the male lead in Chen Kengran's "Hongfen Piao Ling," his demeanor is as good as ever, no less than in his younger days.</p>
<p>Jiang Yiqiu, the innocent Xiaosheng (young male role) who once played Yun Lin in the film "Guangling Tide," in addition to playing dancing as a hobby, has also set up the Tianzhen Fruit Plate Company in his mansion. It is said that on the opening day, he plans to invite all Shanghai film and opera fans to participate in the broadcasting, in order to appeal (transfer rewards to help disaster relief).</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Edited by Bao Zibo, Verified by Lu Chengzhui</p>
<p>Opening Method – Game 10</p>
<p>Black moves first</p>
<p>The moves continue from Game 9</p>
<p>Pawn 7 advances one square, change Black 2 retreats one, Chariot 7 moves to column 3, Elephant 3 advances to square 5, Chariot 3 retreats one, Chariot 1 moves to column 3, Cannon 7 advances two</p>
<p>Explanation of Game 9 Chariot 2 advances four patrolling river, Horse 2 advances three, screen horse, Soldier 7 advances one, in the previous game has said that the purpose of the pair is to destroy the enemy's defense work, Pawn 7 advances one to wait in formation, depending on how the opponent will attack, and then respond accordingly, Cannon 8 moves to column 7, Horse 3 advances two, all old score methods, if the black side uses Chariot 7 to advance one to catch the horse or Cannon 7 to advance seven to capture the elephant are all losing the first move, Soldier 3 advances one has similar meaning as Soldier 7 advances one, and is easier to release the horse, Chariot 7 advances one to capture the horse comes from Soldier 3 advances one, to avoid Cannon 8 advancing two to hit the chariot, so first the pair, if the pair does not capture the horse then the opponent's Cannon 8 advancing two to hit the chariot is indeed a ruthless move, Now that the red side has Pawn 7 advancing one after the pair, there is no way to hit the chariot, giving up the pawn in the third column to capture the horse is intended to compete for the first move, Pawn 7 advancing one to the horse loses the first move.</p>
<p>Horse 2 retreats one to say after the middle first, the latter retreats the horse, the first has a pawn in the seventh column, if the light and heavy are compared, the retreat of the horse is light, the seven pawns are heavy, the retreat of the horse is temporarily harmless, leaving the seven pawns are currently harmful, so advancing the pawn to the horse, is better than retreating, is retreating better than advancing, Chariot 7 moves to column 3 to capture the horse and capture the pawn, is intended to go to the pawn, Elephant 3 advances to square 5, Chariot 3 retreats one are all flat first move, Chariot 1 moves to column 3 smoothly released the chariot and monitor the opponent's cannon road, Cannon 7 advances two unrestricted chariot horse can move.</p>
<p>According to the game from the army 7 advances one to capture the horse from the contact up to the chariot 7 moves to column 3 to capture the horse and capture the pawn stop the result to go to the pawn to relieve the siege the two sides under a degree of tension slightly announce the paragraph.</p>
