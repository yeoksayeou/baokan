<h3 id="c10">反侵略集團與中國 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>中國加入反侵略集團吾乎？</p>
<p>此一問題，關係多方面，而多方面迄今絕無所表示。根本亦因反侵略集團之組織，僅肇端倪，未備輪廓；誠如昨日路透所傳美國人士之觀感，欲「完成此組織之工作，猶待努力」，意謂去完成尚有距離；惟其然，故問題雖複雜遠大，然要求有關方面切實答復，時機猶早。據倫敦電訉：英國下議院於本月十九日重行集會，屆時將有工黨議員漢德森氏，質問首相張伯倫氏，政府有無邀的中國參加反侵略集團之意。其時距今尚有一旬，以國際局勢之幻變萬狀，瞬息改觀，雖祇旬日，亦有夜長夢多之感，則十九日漢德森氏是吾質問及此，是吾如此質問，俱非今日所得逆覩；而屆時是吾旣成爲耍求英國政府切實答復之時機，允未易斷言也。</p>
<p>我人慨歎於張伯倫氏綏靖政策失敗之後，滿望反侵略集團之組織，圓滿完成。事實所示，波蘭外長柏克上校聘問英倫而歸，英波之間，於以形成其歷史之創作，使反侵略集團實現其第一環；辛苦經營、不謂無得；然與理想之集團、相去猶遠。即此俄頃，義大利用兵阿爾巴尼亞，一舉而拔，易如探囊，地中海局勢爲之劇變·亞德里亞海鎖鑰自此旁落；侵略國家旣有予求予取之成績·弱小國家遂有順生逆死之悲哀，南斯拉夫徬惶，希臘戰慄；綜彼咄咄逼人之氣燄，儼然征服一切之先聲；此與稱霸之階段·相去愈近。蓋英波成就之所得吿慰反侵略者，爲義國之侵略而消失矣。外交紆廻，暴力辟易，則決勝於宰制國際之巓者·爲反侵略集團先告組織完成歟？抑爲侵略行動先得各個擊破歟？此以正義爲根據而深深自信之外，不許輕易樂觀者也。</p>
<p>深信於正義之終必伸張，斯無疑於反侵略集團組織之終必實現。夫集團而爲歐洲之集團，是無與於中國，即根本不必以中國加入與否爲問題。雖然，我人殊未信數年來之侵略敎訓，暴力敎訓，猶不足以喚醒偏安孤立，局部安全之迷夢。申言之，一切侵略行動而滋蔓於歐洲以外之任何一隅，謂竟不影響於歐洲，歐洲竟得獨保其安全與均勢者、此爲事理之所必無；何也，歐洲列强之爲列强，雖發源歐洲，然維繫其强盛，維繫其生命者，要在歐洲之外。是以反侵略集團之組織，在其意義上，利害上，實效上，惟有以侵略與反侵略二者爲對壘之二體，而斷乎不容以洲爲界。標榜洲界，徒以獎進界外之侵略，亦以鼓勵規模更大，範圍更大之侵略而已；而界外侵略之昂進，徒使界內侵略氣燄之得所呼應，愈益高漲，徒使界內反侵略措施之多所顧忌，愈益艱難而已。中國海南島，無關當前之軍略，而不免於遭刧；香港越南新加坡菲列賓間之新南羣島，久稱懸案而突然易幟；允侵略與反侵略之前哨接觸、事在歐洲之外，而與歐洲諸國有其直接間接關係者也。</p>
<p>歐洲反侵略之政治家，非不明鑒及此；祗以中國正在被侵略之中，且亦已在反侵略戰爭之中；方今反侵略政家以和平防止侵略之迷夢未醒，殆不願遽以推行反侵略於歐洲之外，而自陷漩渦。故組織反侵略集團者，於其初期，不欲邀請中國參加，乃爲當然之推論。此在中國，旣滿望歐洲乃至任何範圍之反侵略集團之完成，復必以反侵略陣綫中之健者自許，誠使反侵略集團範圍超越歐洲，則中國之樂於參加，當然絕無疑問。然彼方之反侵略組織纔見端倪，即彼反侵略政家之間，亦未見披肝瀝胆，精誠相與，故其前途何如，惟有以熱誠靜觀其發展；而此間已爲反侵略而抗戰二十一月，爭取勝利之條件日益充沛，最後勝利之時期日益接近；則除專心致力於繼續抗戰之外，當然亦無所奢望於反侵略集團之完成。抑歐洲與遠東，乃至於全世界，雖歷史地理各有其繼橫之體系，然政治經濟實相錯綜而不可分；故在今日、中國抗戰入第二期，歐洲反侵略運動尚在第一期，各有其所務，各有其所亟；然國際之最後宰制，必併歐洲遠東以及全世界爲整個之一問題；各國若依然各私其力，各行其是，雖或以局部之各自解決而成茍安之局，然國際旣為整個之一問題，是必集各國之心力於同一基礎，而求其總解決。劃然使世界各方之侵略與反侵略爲對壘之二體，是總解決之始也。</p>

<h3 id="c58">法國駐華大使　戈斯默昨晨抵滬　檢閱儀仗隊後赴使館　旋至天主堂參加禮拜　克萊琪寇爾兩大使會晤似無政治意味 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>法國駐華大使戈斯默氏、於來華赴重慶呈遞國書後、復轉港搭砲艦達宇號來滬、於昨晨九時半抵法租界外灘太古碼頭、法國駐滬總領及法商領袖、均蒞埠歡迎、大使偕使館參贊武官下艦、時軍樂大作、嗣檢閱儀仗隊、旋與歡迎人員略事周旋、卽偕總領事等逕赴法大馬路外灘法大使館駐滬辦事處休息、旋又偕法領事至天主堂街天主堂內參加禮拜、</p>
<p>克萊琪氏諄諄聲明</p>
<p>大陸報云、英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士、與駐華英大使寇爾爵士、作兩日之交換意見、曾討論「共同利益」問題、但克大使於星期五日起程返東京前、復堅稱彼等之會談、並無政治意味、鑒於克大使此决抵華、猶屬第一遭、則渠諄諄聲明之言、在表面可置信、蓋歷來英國外交家之被任爲駐日大使者、均取道上海、而先與駐華大使討論東方局勢也、獨克大使之履任、取道加拿大、而未過滬、故未能與寇爾爵士會談、克大使之來滬、與寇爾大使之於昨日（八日）起程赴渝、雖頗相巧合</p>
<p>調停戰事不能置信</p>
<p>惟外間所傳英國謀調停中日戰爭之謠諑、有若干理由、不能置信、蓋英國於中日戰爭之政策、已一再明白宣佈、卽須至交戰國一方請求調停、英國始將予以考慮、而最近各事、已明白表示雙方均未作此請、甚至未考慮及之、昨據上海負責方面聲稱、中政府對汪精衛和平建議之態度、實爲蔣委員長抱抗戰到底政策之確切表示、同時英國對此態度之信心、已由最近之信用借款表示之、而日本亦不致有遽請英國斡旋之舉、</p>
<p>日報反英語調激烈</p>
<p>沂數星期來、日文報紙與日入統制之華字報紙社評、咸有激烈反英之語調、大足淸晰反映日政府之意見、故一般人士以爲日本苟請他國出而調停、其所抉擇担任此舉之國家、英國必爲最後一國、且信克萊琪爵士此决已獲得關於因日本侵華而引起英日問若干久懸不決的糾紛之直接情報、其主耍者爲武力攫佔鐵路、與封鎖揚子江等貿易途徑之情報、同時、外界對寇爾爵士赴渝所作之揣測、負責方面亦加駁斥、據稱、自商妥信用借款以還、英大使尚無緣與蔣委員長晤談云、</p>
<p>日方揣測意見相反</p>
<p>日文上海每日新聞則作與負責英人意見相反之揣測云、因克萊琪爵士與寇爾爵士見解有根本上之歧異、故彼等之上海會談、似已失敗、該報並表示其見解、作爲此决會談之原因云、英國認爲促進中國之和平、實與自身有利、蓋藉此可維持其在歐之地位、與保護其在華之權益也、會談結果、旣已呈報英政府、則英國將來之對外政策、將作何種轉變、乃甚可注意之事、該報復載星期五日日當局設宴款待克萊琪爵士時之談話、謂日大使館參事森島曾稱、吾人曾互相坦白交換關於中國事變悄况之見解、</p>
<p>會談似無政治意味</p>
<p>至於克萊琪爵士與寇爾爵士之會談、似無政治意味、吾人雖不知彼等所談爲何、但以爲任何兩大使之會談、將使英國外交政策爲之轉變、此次必亦然也、</p>

<p>葡領兩訪日領未遇</p>
<p>駐滬葡萄牙總領事、自接到各輪公司報告後、以事關葡商利益、及船員旅客之安全、故昨日雖爲星期例假、領署仍照常辦公、葡總領事並於咋晨十一時許、往日領署訪三浦總領、因値星期休假、未獲會晤、當與該館職員的定於下午二時、再行往訪希望設法通知日領候晤、但下午再度往訪時、仍未獲晤、故決於今日繼續向日領署提出强硬交涉、要求立卽放行被扣各輪、藉保法益、而維國體、</p>

<p>査被扣匍輪中之棠貝，棠喬·棠魯·三艘、係四馬路三三號美商華美航業公司承租代理、自發生被扣事件後、即由葡商船東報吿葡領請爲交涉、而該公司總經理亨脫氏（Humt）則適因事赴港、致無從請示辦法、茲公司方面、以事態嚴重、特於昨日急電香港、向亨脫氏報吿經過悄形、請示處置辦法、並電請駐滬美總領事提出交涉、並盼兙日返滬主持、</p>
<p>滬溫航綫照常行駛</p>
<p>行駛滬溫綫之葡輪海龍、美達、等、雖遭日艦非法扣查、但德意等國航商、爲維持滬溫航運、仍照常派輪行駛、德商禮和洋行之謀福輪、意商中意公司之德平輪、業於前晚抵溫、定今日裝貨後、仍駛回上海、意商華義洋行之賽利輪、德商魯麟洋行之飛康輪、均電吿於昨日下午先後駛滬、德商禮和洋行之海福輪、則於昨晨四時、由滬駛溫、遠柬公司之哈納輪、俟整理船身後、亦即開航、至葡爲棠賽·美發·山泰·等輪、則因被扣事件尚未解決、眞相不明、故決暫緩開航、</p>

<h3 id="c81">從健康上探討　禁慾與節慾的利弊 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>現在學者間在討論禁慾與節慾問題上。約有兩派：一派則以為康健絕不以性慾行為為條件者，聚訟紛紜，莫衷一是夫性慾發生的目的係繁殖，為生殖性，而非生理性作用，乃人所公認者。洩精亦專為受孕作用，絕非為男女間之娛樂者，人能固精保陽，不使外洩，則其精內所含之數種有興奮力，活動力之分泌物，可化作身體之需要，如洩精非為受孕作用者，即係清耗自身，摧殘一已。試觀各大運動家，或演說家，在舉行盛大運動或演說時，則必禁絕房事，處其淡泊生活，以兾獲得體力上，智力上，最大之效率，故兩派主張，以後派較為多人所承認。</p>
<p>講到性慾對於吾人日常影響之所及，有兩大問題必須研究者；（一）性慾為生理所必需乎？普通一般見解，認性慾於人生，亦猶飢思食，倦思眠等，為人生必不可缺者，實大誤也。蓋性慾僅以人生之一定時期中；顯露活動，前乎此及後乎此，均無性慾之活動，然亦無碍於個人之康健也。（二）性慾因人而異乎？飲食睡眠，乃赤子之本能如是，然人之於性也，則不然；如世有所謂情感缺乏者，其對異性，無絲毫之愛慕，故亦無性交之需求，又有所謂浪漫青年者，或稟之天性，或放蕩自然，縱慾火之中焚，任歐性而妄作，再者甲所視為性美者，在乙則為不足奇，於丙為可憎，試觀各人之性慾不同也如是，則性慾非身體之需也明矣</p>
<p>性慾旣非與食慾同為人生每日不可或缺者，則吾人為求身心的健康計，實不宜縱慾，然旣知性慾為吾人繁衍生殖所必需，則由縱慾所招來的喪失生殖等毛病，如早洩，陰痿，發育不全，月經不調等，應趕快治好。依本醫師的經驗所知，上述各症的療法，求能增精補腎為對症，如使用德國雄壯動物　丸精質製劑男用「補體康」不僅生精補腎，同時能使神經鎮靜不使亢奮，且長期報用，具有返老還童之功，故有許多頑固的早洩陰痿，及發育不全，連續服用，均奏奇效。其女用「補體康」為調精種子良藥。在臨床上久已證實</p>
<h3 id="c82">少年應當健康愉快而純潔 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>少年人士，應當健康，愉快，而且純潔，是固人人之所欲求也。但因發育時期，受不良環境的薰陶，或由猥褻讀物的引誘染上所謂自凟之惡習者，誠比比皆是</p>
<p>就自凟對於健康上影響而言，已覺難以估計，何況尚致其嗣後人格的墮落，道德之淪喪，常見自瀆過久的人，雙目無神，外具暗黑色之環，雙手冰冷，步覆則蹣跚而維艱，日受遺精所苦，臥床則輾轉不得安眠，晨起則呵欠頻仍，狀態至此，可謂已臻可慮之環竟矣。</p>
<p>自瀆遺精，本係不相分離之症，蓋自凟斵傷之後，精關失其控制力而呈過敏狀態，稍一刺擊，即患遺洩，久之神經衰弱，腎虧發育不全等症均起，治療之法，應嚴守攝生，戒除自瀆，服以德國出品「耐斯遺精片」即可制止，如再輔以青春腺素大補劑德國男用「補體康」則恢復健康尤易。</p>

<h3 id="c83">怎樣才有治淋把握 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>治療千變萬化的淋病，貴其有中心之把握，庶幾應付裕如，然怎樣才有治淋的把握？這問題現在總算解決。因為現在世界各國風狂似地研究淋病的扑滅法，結果德國淋病學大師彼德博士竟發明淋病特效藥「克淋儂」一藥，在為世界各國醫家所償用。茲將世界各國淋病專家之臨床實驗摘要述之如下</p>
<p>美國利物浦博士云：某夕來急性淋之患者，其痛苦殊甚，膿血交流，精神大受大擊，詢之患此曾經治療否？答以曾服市上檀香油及化學療法等藥劑服後依然不能得到根本解決，余乃用種種科學方法檢查，知其淋菌已逆　後尿道部，故後尿道部之炎症，甚為熾烈可畏。余乃囑其停止此等不良之療法，改用德國彼德博士明之「克淋儂」，經過末一星期，所有炎症，完全消退，至八日後全部根治。博士曾語病人曰，不良之市上劣藥，對於淋症實有損而無益，能服用經醫師介紹如「克淋儂」一藥治有根本迅速安全之根治。</p>
<p>瑞士愛迪麥博士亦對「克淋儂」有最豐富之經歷，據云，余曾用「克淋儂」一藥治愈一患六七年的老淋病，該患者曾遊歷各國各都大市，經過無數之名醫治療，病勢總難根本解決，問余有根本治愈此病之把握否？余笑調足下如有決心治淋之把握，則余必可根本負責治愈。患者從余之言，乃為檢查與診斷之後，知其已成淋毒性關節炎，乃囑其服用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，使其抗淋殺菌作用，滿佈關節與血液中，於是此艱難之淋病，在五星期中完全根本治愈，恢復其健全之機構，蓋「克淋儂」一藥超過任何之化學製劑也。</p>
<h3 id="c84">癆病治騐例 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>患者馮永德，體素羸弱。於二十歲甞患咯血。休養數月即愈，後因用腦過度，去夏又發，胸悶氣嗆。咳出血痰。日暮發三十七度七之輕熱，形體益呈清減，憔悴不堪，入夜睡難安枕。多夢心悸，兼有盜汗，至晨起頭目眩暈，精神倦怠。經用X光檢查，肺部有銀角大小空洞，肺癆已至第三期，乃囑內服德國「補肺拿爾」。服未兩瓶。盜汗發熱俱除，病勢大見好轉，於是繼續不斷的服用至三星期，並同時令其在家絕對安靜，與多攝營養品？於咳嗆咯血等症，完全獲愈，而食慾大增，體重增加。一變而為狀健之美男子矣。</p>

<p>流竄如匪淋　淋菌之性，有如水銀，逃竄鑚營，真是無孔不入，而行蹤飄忽，又類如匪寇，故要求如何始可將如匪寇之淋菌，加以完全弋獲扑滅之，要此等目的之　到，自不能乞靈於一般透膜殺菌，及平凡的化學療法，因此等療法均不過在表面上略現一時之效，而不能將深入組織內之淋菌，根本給以扑滅，因只要有一個淋菌在吾人體內，則以殺菌之功效，不免盡棄，故現在問題之重點，在於如何可以一網將淋菌打盡，始可　　　　根治。似在以潛菌最廣泛關節炎面　則一般所謂局部療法，乃透膜殺菌，化學療法等，幾乎絕對不能成功。</p>
<p>抗淋　菌療治　由於上述關係，根治淋毒性關節炎，不得不採用抗淋　菌作用的新療法，而以現在能勝任愉快，舉世一驚公認之內服藥，惟「克淋儂」足以當之，　於二十年之經驗，每年所新出之藥品，無不試驗殆遍，而始終信賴「克淋儂」一藥者，以比具有增加自面　存　淋菌，包圍病灶，僅無一個淋菌漏網之弊，余里用德國　淋面消，及靜電辦法。X線電療、　相為用，僅「克淋儂」殺菌功效，　　　　、則屬於和由之關節炎，余恒用此等療法、　到根治　、此可稱為標準之　淋方法。自　日起紀旬万　多二十號，句號僅　號金五角</p>

<p>百件期紗</p>
<p>始而要求解的、旋見紗價陡漲、忽復函催交貨、恒安以共出爾反爾、嚴予拒却、安樂當因無可取巧、爰乘前批現貨交易之間隙、利用未給該貨交淸憑據機會、重向恒安催索筒紗二十五件、恒安經理戴仁安以安樂紡織廠乃本市織造業之翹楚、豈應出此費一批代價砍兩批貨物之思想、經與該廠主鄧仲和及張厚勤理論、詎鄧等堅稱恒安罔顧信用、</p>
<p>圖賴貨品</p>
<p>隨延宋啟文律師向第一特區地方法院對恒安紗號曁其經理戴仁安提出控訴、請求判令交付所買二十支筒紗十五件、又十六支筒紗十件、雖被告於庭訊時、着其僱員沈愼德到案、證明該紗早已由渠偕同安樂廠新井·日信（均系日商）·兩羊行及安愼洋棧提交原吿自備之汽車運去、因係現款交易、故無取貨收條、並由新井等貨棧職員證明當日</p>
<p>提貨事實</p>
<p>但初審時推事卒認定被吿旣不能提出該紗業已交給原告收淸之有力證據、且各證人所供、亦復大相逕庭、則被吿之所主張、殊難置信、判決應向原吿交付二十支筒紗十五件、又十六支筒紗十件、訴訟費用由被吿負扭、恒安奉判後、未能甘服、特延張意平律師向江蘇高等法院第二分院提起上訴、瀝陳不服理由、略謂安樂所購立馬牌筒紗二十五件、均於其付款之日交淸、有流水等賬簿一</p>

<h3 id="c113">「擴大反侵略組織」 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>獅子搏兔，還須出其全力，這什麽如雄獅一般的英國，民治國的首領，對於狼虎成羣的法西斯國，却只是頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，一味因循敷衍，得過且過，以致牠們爲所欲爲，貽害無窮呢？大聲的吼呌，我們的確聽見過了；然而吼呌之後的行動，却仍使我們不得不告失望！</p>
<p>她，英國，民治國的首領，反侵略組織的發起者，雖然有意防範法西斯國的續行侵略，却只注意在東歐，而忽略了南歐，以致義大利乘瑕蹈隙，一舉而顚覆阿爾巴尼亞；又只注意着歐洲，而忽略了亞洲，例如工黨議員詢問要吾請中國及遠東各國加入反侵略組織，就沒有聽見下文，張伯倫的無意於此，或無暇及此，可想而知，以致我們的敵人，另一個侵略的法西斯國，還得逍遙法外，橫行無忌；而最後，最重要的，更只邀致東歐一般弱小，却遺棄了力足以獨抗各法西斯國的蘇聯，以致蘇聯超然獨處，而德義軸心，依然橫互歐洲，莫奈之何。凡此種種，我總認爲反侵略運重的範圍太狹小，聲勢欠浩大，而力量尤其薄弱，旣不足以號召，遠樹聲威，更不足以有所影響，阻遏法西斯國的侵略。如果一直這樣下去，我可以說，歐洲弱小的被併呑，當然不免再有發見，而不列顚帝國的覇權，總也有發生動搖的一天吧！</p>
<p>爲今之計，能够組織全世界的反侵略大同盟、固然最好，因爲這樣，才能以整個的集體，對付得了那三强的軸心；其次則至少在南歐，邊致南斯拉夫，希臘，保加利亞，土耳其等，另組一個集團，在亞洲，邀致安南，暹羅，菲列濱，荷屬印度等，另組一集團，庶幾可以分頭應付。吾則國際間的前途，就不堪設想了。</p>
<p>可惜英國似乎還沒有這樣的決心；不但英國，就是已受威脅的羅馬尼亞，還恐怕觸怒德國，不敢和蘇聯親近，而危險已及於門庭的南期拉夫，更恐怕觸怒義大利，熟視鄰國阿爾巴尼亞的毀滅，不敢一救，她們將來總不免有悔之晚矣的一天吧！</p>

<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>下午，兩個二十多歲的鄕下人，手裏都拎着一隻藤籃，一前一後地走向小城門邊來。在前的一個，看見了守衛的黃衣人，照例向他　了一躬，將藤籃放到地上，打開蓋頭，聽由他檢查。</p>
<p>黃衣人只有一個，他照例一聲不響，板起了面孔，一手扶着槍俯下身去，一手亂翻着藤籃裹的東西，爲了不耐煩，一翻出來，就向地上一扔。</p>
<p>在後的鄕下人，開始也和在前的一樣做着：鞠弱；將藤籃放在地上，打開蓋頭。可是黃衣人正在檢査着第一隻藤籃，沒有注意到這第二隻藤籃，而牠父正有些偏在他的身旁，爲他所不大容易看見。</p>
<p>倐然那在後的鄕下人，在第二隻藤籃中，取出了一件黑黑的小東西，趁黃衣人低着頭，就將那小東西的口，對準了他的太陽穴，扳了一下。拍的一聲，黃衣人倒在地上，血從他的兩太陽穴，直湧而出。</p>
<p>兩個鄉下人，將藤籃丟在地上，回身就奔。</p>
<p>響聲驚動了大城門裏關帝廟中的其他黃衣人。他們，的五六個，連忙趕出來看。一瞥之下，知道了究竟，他們留兩個人伺候在地上的人以外，就都出城追着。然而過了弔橋，轉了兩個灣，到了十字街頭，他們就沒有辦法了，只好停下來疇躇着。</p>
<p>當然他們不曉得來人已經從那條街逸去，不能向那條街追去。還有，他們很知道，不論那一條街只要再走半里，就是盡頭，再過去就是田野和鄉村。而田野和鄕村呢，却正是他們輕易不敢深入的禁地。</p>
<p>在他們向街上人詢問而毫無結果之後，他們彼此嘰咕了一回，就只好回向城裏去。</p>
<p>在小城門邊，他們一面收拾着死在地上的同伴，一面冉檢査地上的東西。在各種破衣服亂紙頭之間，他們發見了一封信，抽開來一看，裏面有這樣的幾句話：</p>
<p>……不要死賴在城圈裹！有種的下鄉來，咱們在戰塲上見個高低！要是不下來，咱們亦會上來。</p>
<p>現在先給一些顏色你們看看！……</p>
<p>底下有正式的具名：××軍第××隊長李一龍。</p>
<p>一切事情都交到了駐城的司令部，司令就差人找郭老二來商議。</p>
<p>郭老二本來是地痞，素爲鄉里所不齒，爲了歡迎黃衣人有功，他們就派他在「警察局」辦事。從此他就得了法，有財有勢。</p>
<p>郭老二一到，便說，這事不能輕易放過，至少也應該示示威。他們商議了一番，就分一半人，約五六十個，排隊出城，到了十字街口，不管左右，就一直向前趕去。</p>
<p>街道盡了，不過父三里，就到了一個鎭上。這是郭老二的故里，大家看見郭老二走在一羣黃衣人的頭裏，便不的而同地向他投出了毒視的眼光，暗暗地駡着：不要臉的畜生！</p>
<p>黃衣人要休息，由郭老二領入了最大的酒店黃隆源。主人黃冠三和家屬，連忙從後門裏逃了出去，只剩兩個年老的夥計承應着，扛出了兩　酒，請這些異邦「貴客」喝。</p>
<p>一時之間，鎭上年輕的男女，逃得一個都沒有，所剩下來的，就只有年老的和年幼的。因爲他們受到的敎訓太多，早已知道應該怎樣自處了。</p>
<p>天已傍晚了，當然可以回去了，而且更不能不回去了，於是踉蹌的脚步，戲着醉醺醺的黃衣人，走出了黃隆源。</p>
<p>郭老二又向領隊的獻計了，說。就這樣回去，未免給「匪徒」笑話，也應該給他們一些厲害。領隊的聽從了他，就辦了這樣兩件事：</p>
<p>第一放火燒，就從黃隆源燒起。燒時，郭老二對他的老幼鄰里演說着：</p>
<p>—你們包庇「匪徒，」所以給你們懲罰。以後再是這樣，殺個雞犬不留！</p>
<p>第二，由郭老二執筆，寫了一張似通非通的字條，貼在街中的橋柱上，大意是說：</p>
<p>……我們已經下鄕了，你們躱到那裏去了！有種的進城來！……</p>
<p>他們在暮色蒼茫中，平安地回到了城裹，大家都呼了一口輕鬆的氣。郭老二大受司令的獎勵，說他辦事旣週到而父能幹，馬上就提拔他做「警察局長。</p>
<p>郭老二的得童是可想而知的。</p>
<p>明天早上，郭老二按着平常的習慣，到「縣知事署」西首永春茶館喝茶並吃早點。他爲了心頭高興，面上更是喜氣揚揚，一坐下去，就向走堂的以及鄰座的人，說了許多許多話，歌頌他主子的「德政」，並發表他榮任「警察局長」後的大政方針。</p>
<p>正在他發表宏論的時候，外面走進了一個人，看見他，便彎下身去，用熱烈的口吻對他說：</p>
<p>—郭局長，外面有人要拜託你老人家一件事，請你出去見見。</p>
<p>郭老二向那人一看，似乎是認得的鄰里，可是名字却想不起來了。</p>
<p>—不好呌他進來麼？</p>
<p>說時，他的面上便有些不好看的樣子。</p>
<p>那人又湊前一步，咬着他的耳朶。</p>
<p>—來人有機密事，假使郭局長帮了忙，有一些孝敬，所以不便在這裏談。</p>
<p>郭老二一聽有孝敬，面色便和緩下來，立起身隨着來人出去。</p>
<p>果然，茶館門口已經有一個人候在那裏，他一看見郭老二出來，就迎卑一步，將一手向上一揚，說：</p>
<p>—送郭局歸天！</p>
<p>同時，又是拍的一聲，從那揚起的手裏發出，郭老二便向後倒了下去，眉心間一股血流，淌到滿面，淌到滿地。</p>
<p>茶館裏的人都向外跑，向四面跑，那來邀郭老二出去以及揚手的人，也夾在他們裏面跑，沒有多久，誰也不曉得他們，這兩個人，跑到那裹去了。</p>
<p>「警察」來了，在郭老二的胸前又拾起了一張字條，上面寫着：</p>
<p>……咱們進城來了，怎麼樣？有種的下鄕來，走得遠些！……</p>
<p>一連串的閉城，逐戶搜査，鬧得馬仰人翻，雞犬不寗，結果，就只鬧在城圈裹，而且是，鴻飛冥冥，弋人何慕！」</p>

<p>— 潤圭</p>
<p>這是個謎，讓牠在腦中蕩着吧！</p>
<p>在得不到究竟該回答些什麼時，我這未安慰着自己：人類的虛僞是從最遠的先祖遺傳下來的，不該有作用，企圖；所以有這種悄形者，全是人類太會運用木性，於是我就輕視人類，當然也輕視自己！</p>
<p>在童年的時候，偶然也會發覺親戚的欺詐虛僞，不過因當時無所知，祇當這是長輩的天經地義，或處世態度，所以根本不介意，轉了個背，已讓沁思用到踢小皮球，打彈子上面去了。入了學生時代，這種悄形看的多了：如同學的抄夾帶被敎員捉到了，他們必硬說沒有作過弊；在女生面前特別喜歡誇耀，吹牛，雖然他自已也明知對方對自已的話，祇當耳旁吹過一陣風。以後到了社會，各色各樣觸目驚心的欺騙事情，看的更透了，可是我的心却也更感到惶惑，茫然，同時也更輕蔑人類。</p>
<p>人類的虛僞，總是千方百計的：有的利用了虛偽，想騙得些好處，有的爲了某件事物，就不得不虛僞一下，好像若缺少了虛僞，在社會上立足就祗有獨隻脚似的，沒有憑藉，站得不穩，儘管你的才學好，本領高，只好飄在虛無漂渺中，一個不小心，摜在地上，弄的滿體傷痕。相反地，若能靈活地虛僞起來，至少你不會做個餓癯了肚子哭喪着臉，嚷着哀求於人「做做好事吧！」的窮措大。一言以蔽之：虛僞就是敎你怎樣處世，怎樣活命。</p>
<p>這樣的意思，說來好像近乎唯虛僞主義的崇拜者了但是我雖不是如此主張，而有些事實放在眼前，却不能不令人有此感·你看，現在社會上誰要活命，誰要顯貴，誰就不得不虛僞入誰就不得不歪曲地來利用虛僞。於是誰也祇有永遠給人唾罵輕視的份兒！</p>
<p>虛僞之成為虛僞，這樣說來，該不是偶然的了。</p>

<h3 id="c119">上海社會敎育之現狀 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 鳶馳</p>
<p>社會敎育，範圍原極廣泛，上海父爲中國最大都市，擁有三百餘萬人口，爲適應環境需要，社會事業亦特殊發達，除政府機關撥款興辦外，私人創設者亦屬不少，但抗戰閒始後，政府舉辦之事業，十九淪陷戰區，其少數未陷戰區者，亦以經費來源斷絕，宣吿停頓，迄今尙能存在者，俱爲私人創設性質，而其施敎對象，亦僅限於租界市民，較之戰前，誠不勝滄桑之感。茲先就戰前官辦事業之淪入日軍手及陷於停頓者概述於後：</p>
<p>一·民衆敎育館　本市市立民衆敎育館原設滬南文廟路，規模宏大，事務發達，各種附屬事業，辦理　著成續，實爲全市社會教育最完善最充實之實施機關，抗戰後即陷戰區。</p>
<p>二·圖書館、市立圖書館原有三所，一爲上海市圖書館，在市中心區，一爲市立圖書館附設於民衆敎育館，一爲流通圖書館在邑廟，三所中以市圖書館爲規模最大，建築最新，戰後或燬於火，或爲日軍所用</p>
<p>三·博物館　設市中心區，建築富麗堂皇，內容亦頗充實，戰事爆發後，除少數珍品曾遷藏安全地帶外，餘已散失殆盡，其宮殿式之巨厦，且爲僞市府强行佔用。</p>
<p>四·體育塲　規模最大者爲上海市體育塲，建築之偉大，遠東無出其右者；此外尚有市立第一體育塲，位於滬南大吉路，規模較小；至簡易體育塲，則散處各鄉鎭，悉由當地學校兼管，戰後已全部陷落。市體育塲各項建築，且有一部份被燬於砲火，近已爲日軍佔作兵營。</p>
<p>五·動物園　設於滬南文廟路，與民衆敎育館爲對隣，所畜各種動物，除一部份遷置顧家宅公園公開展覽外，餘悉被難。</p>
<p>六·植物園　位於滬南龍華路，戰前已改隸市立園林塲，地處僻靜，環境淸幽，所植奇卉異葩，無慮數千種，戰後悉陷日軍之手。</p>
<p>七·民衆閱報處　散佈市立各鄕鎭，不下數百處，戰前均由社會局指定各學校兼辦，或以原報張貼或經改編爲壁報，戰後隨學校之停辦而全部消滅</p>
<p>八·識字學校　上海於二十四年七月起，即開始大規模識字敎育之推打，至廿六年六月止，先後共辦六屆，每屆叫個月。實施方針，包括兩大部份，一爲文字敎育，一爲公民敎靑，其具體目標，則爲國民道德之培養，簡易文字之學習，普通常識之灌輸，民衆生活之改善，民族意識之養成，生產能力之訓練。辦理二年，成效大著，全市之已受識字敎育者共有三一七·五二六人，即以戰前之最後一屆即第六屆言，全市尚設識字學校九一所，計三六八班，入學學生二二·二六二人，據調査統計，全市文盲截至戰前爲止，僅餘三〇九·三三四人，較之未辦識字敎育前，已减少文盲達半數以上，倘能待以時期，不難全部肅淸。但自抗戰開始後，大好事業，即陷停頓，可謂上海社會敎育上最大損失。</p>
<p>以上各種社會敎育事業，戰前均由政府機關主持辦理，戰後已全部停頓，無一存在，此外尚有若干事業，過去雖爲官辦，但一部份尚能遷地恢復，而現有之社敎之事業，則大部份爲私人創設或戰後新興者，茲亦併述於後。</p>
<p>一·民衆學校</p>
<p>民衆學校過去雖爲官辦，且均散處四鄉。但自上海淪陷後，一般原任敎職員鑒於民衆敎育之重要，已有一部份遷入租界復校，惟數量較前大减，僅有十四五級左右，經費亦萬分支絀，故亦酌收書籍雜費，以資挹注，而各項實施辦法，亦經劃一規定，茲錄其要點如左：</p>
<p>甲·宗旨　遵照中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針，授與年長失學民衆以簡易之智識技能</p>
<p>乙·校舍設備　以借用普通學校者爲原則。</p>
<p>丙·學生　男女兼收，必要時得男女分設，但以十六歲以上四十歲以下者爲限。</p>
<p>丁·時期　每六個月爲一期，每日敎育二小時。</p>
<p>戊·程度　分初高兩級，初級相當於小學一年級，高級相當於小學三年級，得採複式編制。</p>
<p>已·學科分量　國語：初級佔總時問百分之六十六，高級佔百分之五十。算術：初級佔總時間百分之十二，高級佔百分之十。公民訓練：初級佔總時間百分之十四，高級佔百分之八。樂歌與體靑：初高級各佔總時間百分之八。常識與簡易職業，初級併合於其他各科，高級各佔百分之十二。</p>
<p>庚·敎材　除自編者外，採用國立編譯館及商務印書館出版之識字讀本，短期小學課本，老少通，及民衆讀本等，由校參照學生程度，在此動圍內選用。</p>
<p>二·補習學校</p>
<p>上海之補習學校，一年以來，由私人創設者，如雨後春筍，已達二百餘校，學生六萬左右。各校性質，大別之可分普通敎育與職業敎育一種。所設普通敎育，着重語文，數字，及常識之補充。所謂職業敎育，則職業界之各個部門，幾已完全具備。至戰後特殊發達原因，不外三種：一爲商業界低級職員求知慾之高漲，一爲普通學校學生受戰事影響無力續學而轉變途徑；其又一原因，則爲民間經濟力量之普遍衰落，無力負投子弟普通敎育之費用，送入補習學校，冀於短時期內獲得一技之長，爲謀生之術。有此三因，補習學校乃能蓬勃一時，惟於質的方面，或猶未能盡如人意耳。</p>
<p>三·街童敎育</p>
<p>街童敎育，此爲戰後適應環境需要之最新產物。上海自戰事發生以至淪陷爲孤島後，難民麕集，流浪兒童，　　街頭，到處皆是，熱心敎育人士認有救濟必要，於是慕集經費，組織上海街實敎育會負責辦理。截至目前止，已辦有街童學校三十所，合計五十級，敎育兒童四千餘人，一切敎育活動，與學校不同，敎材亦由街童敎育會規定原則，由敎師隨時自編，敎學時間亦以迎合街童之便利爲原則，校舍則完全借用公共塲所，各廟宇祠堂等等。但必要時亦借用學校校舍或民房，茲誌此項新事業之實施要點如左：</p>
<p>甲·敎育宗旨　在扶助實足年齡自六歲至十五歲之流浪失學兒童，予以相當敎育，使其身心健全，並獲得基本知能，以適應現實生活。</p>
<p>乙·敎育方式　一·敎的方面：集會，分組，訪問，個別指導二等。</p>
<p>二·養的方面：就街童日常生活上予以醫藥矯治救助亞改進其生產方法，或介紹職業權會等。</p>
<p>丙·實施步驟　一·登記街童。二·指導敎師。三·接洽敎育塲所。四·檢騐體格。五·規定敎育時間。六·派員輔導。</p>
<p>丁·敎學日程　一·敎師準備。二·街童集合。三·淸潔檢查·四·日會—唱街童歌或報吿時事常識及精神講話。五·全班的或分團的特種敎學活動，如國語算術社會設計表演等。六·唱遊及運動。七·組會·——由各組組長主持討論組務進行事項。</p>
<p>四·難民敎育</p>
<p>難民敎育，顧名思義，亦知此項敎宵實爲戰後之新興事業。當上海戰事發生後，四郊難民，　集　區，收容所先　成立，由國際救濟會，慈善團聯合救濟災會，救濟戰區難民委員會，難民救濟分會，紅十字會，紅卍字會，及各同鄕會各公團等分別主辦，最多時敗容所達二百二十餘所之多，敎育辦法，各自爲政，漫無標準，敎育事務，即由各所管理員兼仟，方法亦多不同，此後各主辦機關鑒於難民敎育之重要，相率設置訓導組或敎育組，主持各該機關所轄各所之敎育事宜，但仍僅注意於兒童部份。直至紅十字會國際委員會担負各所給養資任以後，乃組設敎育委員會，統一主持全市之難民敎育，事業設施，方入正軌，而受敎育之難民，最多時竟達十四萬九千七百人之多。至其實施內容，則六歲至十六歲之難童受兒童敎育，分國語算術常識唱歌體育等科，國語算術常識爲基本科目，必須敎育，唱歌及體育則視各所設備人才環境而定，敎育時間每週至多廿二小時。十六歲以上之難民，則受成人敎育，分識字，精神訓練，演講，說書，電影，健身操等，以識字敎育爲主，以演講說書等爲輔，每週敎育時閒至少廿一小時，每週至多廿六小時。至原有生活技能或較爲智巧之難民，則更施以職業敎育，分職業訓練及生產敎育兩種，職業訓練授以職業知識及技能，生產敎育授以各種工藝製作之技術，現已開設工藝製作工塲二十二種，如刺繡，縫級，木工，編織等等，已有出品發售。倘能持之以恒，精神推行，則消費之難民，不難一變而爲生產者矣。</p>
<p>五·里弄敎育</p>
<p>所謂里弄敎育，實相等於過去之巡廻敎育，惟其巡廻範圍，則以里弄爲單位耳。其實施辦法，富有流動性，凡附近並無學校，而居民衆多之里弄，即爲其施敎塲所，校舍大都借用公共塲所，或熱心敎育者之餘屋。設所十分簡單，除敎育上必用者外，餘均由兒童自備，即桌椅亦由兒童帶來。敎育內容，則注重基本訓練，允着　於日常生活知能及　　觀念與民族意識之灌輸。受敎者　爲兒童，似可劃入學校敎育範圍，但以實施辦法，與學校敎育逈然不同，故實爲一種社！敎靑，舊社會敎育之對象，原不僅限於兒童也。現全市受敎於此項里弄敎育者，的有四百三十餘人，分爲七級，散處七處，每處失學兒童减少時，即另遷其他里弄施敎，亦爲適應戰後實際需要之產物。</p>
<p>六·報童敎育</p>
<p>上海爲新聞事業薈萃之區，兒童之賴售報爲生者，數以千計，此項兄童，每日將各報所刊重要新聞，高呼街頭，到處奔馳，其足以影響民衆心理者至鉅，實有施以嚴格訓練之必要，本市熱心敎育人士，爰發起報童教育之實施，現設報童學校的十級，招有學生四百餘人，除予報童以日常生活知能及語文敎育外，允特別注意於時事常識之報吿，使每一報童能逐日聽取關於時事之要聞，其敎學時間，以不妨碍兒童售報時間爲原則，校舍均利用普通學校或其他公共塲所，刻正籌集經費，力求擴充也。</p>
<p>七·民衆體育</p>
<p>上海之民衆體育，素稱發達。戰前社會局特設民衆體育股，指導全市民衆體育，並舉辦業餘運動會及競走比賽等等。市立各體育塲訓練民衆體育，不遺餘力。中華全國體育協進會父主持國際運動比賽。抗戰以後，以上各機關，均已停頓。但運動比賽，氣象依然蓬勃。除田徑賽因缺乏廣大塲地殊少舉行外，足球籃球網球游泳競爭等之練習與比賽，照常進行。</p>
<p>除以上所述外，尚有其他種種社會敎育事業，不勝縷述。如市立圖書館被毀後，私人設有丁香流通圖書館中國流通圖書館丁氏圖書館等。總之，戰後之上海社會敎育，公家辦者少，私人辦者多，允以補習學校爲最發達，且有若干事業聯合設置一處，格於租界定章，未能對外公開，故確切調査，殊非易事。至新興社會敎育事業，則均爲戰事環境所需要，在此抗戰建國過程中，頗具有深長之意義也。</p>
<h3 id="c120">上海各敎會於非常期間之工作 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 鄧淑媛</p>
<p>敎會在滬地設立的歷史，已有九十年之久，最初的敎堂築於鄭家木橋。九十年後之今日，情形變遷極大，現在上海敎堂數自已達七十餘，共中有五十七敎堂係屬正宗，敎友數目達一萬人。</p>
<p>各敎會之聯絡由於上海傳道會負責。聖經之出版出售及贈送，總會設於香港路一五八號，至於普通宗敎文學總出版處則設於博物院路一二八號廣學會。此外滬地敎會尚有廣播電台之設立（呼號XMHD週波七六〇），每日播音七小時，內容除講道外，徇有世界各國及國內宗敎新聞之報吿及音樂等。</p>
<p>前歲八月間，滬戰爆發，滬地我國基督敎領袖，鑒於救濟工作迫切之需要，會發起一聚餐會，邀請居滬中外敎友，商討對於傷兵難民之救濟。彼時英美各國政府屢决强迫僑民返國，而出席此聚餐會之外籍敎友仍出意料，因之形成基督徒之聯合陣綫。上海基督敎聯合會救濟事業之組織於此時成立。</p>
<p>聯合會成立後工作成績顯著，滬戰開始後難民遍地，聯合會立即開始募捐，並成立十八處難民收容所，收容難民數目的十五萬人，辦理難民之衣，食，住，爲時已七月之久。難民尋得生計後即自行離所，最後僅餘難民二千二百餘，集聚於第十八難民收容所，設立於赫德路昌平路，現餘留者爲四百人，唯此時性質較前不同，難民多自食其力，聯合會給以相當之津貼。此外聯合會並設立一肺癆療養院，專爲患肺癆之難民居住。</p>
<p>戰區倉猝不及携帶衣服，同時生活發生問題之收容所外之難民亦由聯合會予以　當救濟。慕爾堂及婦女自治會負責大部縫級工作。根據慕　當遍年工作報吿，已製就之棉褥棉被，臥單達一千一百三十床，衣服十二萬九千六百十六件，彼等現仍繼續工作，去秋滬戰天氣漸寒，聯合會贈近兵士之棉背心爲數極多。</p>
<p>上述收容所外少難民食　問題，聯合會曾於七個月中，由慕爾堂救濟三十萬人之糧食</p>
<p>關於傷兵之救濟，滬戰時聯合會負責辦理傷兵醫院數所，其他傷兵醫院亦直接或間接獲得聯合會經濟及人力上之幫助。受重傷之兵士，給予特別飲食。所有傷兵，均給以友誼上之安慰。靑年基督徒多數自願前往充任看護之職。傷兵出院後，輒來書懐念其所獲親切之看獲。</p>
<p>各傷兵醫院關閉後，某西籍基督敎醫師建議於上海國際紅十字會開設一殘廢傷兵警院，事事收容失腿失臂之兵士。此醫院成立於去年一月十日，院址係舊有之第十七號傷兵醫院。傷兵總數爲四百零三人，醫院中爲之裝配假腿假臂，使之行動。無職業者則敎以生活技能，使其出院後不致流浪街頭。此中多數兵士，尋得生命之新精神後，自願作基督信徒者爲數甚多。</p>
<p>救世軍於滬戰時，由於上海國際紅十字會經濟上之幫助，設立難民收容所數處，一在西愛咸斯路，自戰爭開始至今，共收容難民二萬三千人，第二收容所設立於交通大學，於七個月中收容難民一萬七千人，此外於小沙渡路設第三收容所，收容難民七千人，並設有難民肺癆病院，給與特別看護</p>
<p>對於無家可歸之孤兒，救世軍收留之，敎以縫工，織襪，製鞋，木工，及製造其他日用品手工藝，已售出二千餘元。多數收容所中作工之難民，均已獲有技能，用以維持生活·彼等出所後曾聯合出資，捐助救世軍的八十元，用以表示彼等之感激及謝忱。</p>
<p>關於傷兵與難民之敎育，基督敎聯合會會視之爲救濟工作中一種主要工作。發院中漸愈之傷兵及各收容所中之難民，均給以普通敎育，同時並授以職業敎育，以期難民離所後，得以維持生計。</p>
<p>南市居民歸去者甚多。房屋十允被焚燬，多拾取破碎瓦礫築牆以禦風霜。敎會有鑒於此，自去歲三月，組成普益工藝社。上海國際紅十字會收集舊衣破襪，送往該處，由彼等廢物利用，製成各種實用品出售。並設施診間以濟貧病。由西籍醫士担任義務工作。更鑒於兒實敎育之璽耍，幼稚園及工人子弟課窒乃相繼成立，又因難民之營養不足，乃製造豆漿以補充之。</p>
<p>最近此般難民，於頽牆殘壁瓦礫斷磚之下，尋闢肥沃土壞，墾植各種蔬菜以謀生。</p>
<p>工藝社中每日工作者二百餘人，求助之人則盈千累萬。多數難民衣食無着，奄奄待斃。工藝社中又苦於無資多收工人，某日，社中微求自願退職，以讓與更貧困者工作，某老翁捐助八日所得工資八角，彼所有者僅此八角耳。此項組織極有擴大之必要。</p>

<p>— 感薇</p>
<p>抗戰之初，記得在精衛先生會經說過這樣一句話的：「難民是很容易被侵略者利用而化成漢奸的。」那時候的汪「先生」。當然還是身列要人之流，他的言論自然也不失爲名言的。難民之所以容易被侵略者利用而化成漢奸，據我的推測，大概總是一個人對於抗戰存毫無把握之心，簡言之，即意志不堅定。其决大概是利慾薰心，不顧國家民族而甘爲漢奸。的確，去做漢奸的勾當，自昔就被人稱爲活路的，於是，那時的在先生能够獨具隻眼，警吿難民，切勿要走上這條活路，然而時至今日，固然是「死路」比了「活路」來的多，如果是準確的話，那麽，爲什麽「孤島」上十餘萬無家可歸的難民，情願過着最悲慘的生活，掙扎在「死路」口，而不走像在先生所說的「活路」呢？這理由很簡單，他們抱着一片意志堅定的心，相信最後勝利必屬於我。但一個人不顧廉恥，不顧人格，則「活路」也實在並不缺少的。</p>
<p>想不到誣衊難民是很容易被侵略者化成漢奸的在先生，竟亦搖身一變，顯現原形來了。不過在先生的所以做起漢奸來，爲名爲利，却不敢斷定，我們看下列電訊就可明白：</p>
<p>重慶五日美聯社訊：數星期前，重慶方面代表赴河內將其赴歐護照交汪時，曾以二十萬元交注，爲代表國民政府考察之赴歐放費，惟汪則仍將該款奉還重慶，再度表示其尊嚴？謂：</p>
<p>「余非爲名，更非金錢所可買者。」</p>
<p>不過，在氏之爲名爲利，姑置不談，但讀重慶公佈在精衛勾結日本，密謀賣國之鐵證罪狀後，感慨實深，想到他幼年時所作那首名滿天下的詩句，實有不勝今昔之感：</p>
<p>「慷慨歌燕市，從容作楚囚，</p>
<p>引刀成一快，不負少年頭。」</p>
<p>昔日音調鏗鏘的詩句，如今祇落得汚臭滿身，名人一至於斯，能無悲哉！</p>
<h3 id="c123">舞弊·侵佔·盜竊及其他 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>在不健全的社會制度下，所產生的畸形現象，必然的是有其客觀的因素；換句話說，一個人的爲非作歹，並不是有先天性的，一切罪惡的長成，都是基於現實社會裏的畸形誘力。在良莠不齊的都市裏，一般沒有控制自己的理智力量的人們，往往會惑於某種事物，而以某種事物爲實現自已慾望或寄託情緒的對象，以致於產生不可救藥的惡果，這是無可諱言的一般實情。</p>
<p>上海都市，本來是一個罪惡的淵藪，利用詭詐，欺騙的方式而進取物質，所在皆是。邇來滬西賭窟之多，及其給予一般意志不堅定的人們底影響，更其加深了上海製造罪惡的速度，眞使人不寒而慄</p>
<p>近幾個月以來，展開報紙的社會新聞版，那因進出賭窟而發生業務上的舞弊，侵佔，盜竊等惡果的記載，幾無日無之，允以薪給階級爲甚。</p>
<p>這些薪給階級出入於賭窟，除了一部份不自量力的好賭之徒外，我想，他們必存了一個僥倖心。在物價騰貴的現在，薪給階級的生活方式自然是相當淸苦，欲期望增厚物質的享受，也等於「餅充饒」；於是乎就別闢蹊徑，希冀以橫財的獲得，去充實自己的生活，而進出於賭窟；不幸的悲慘後果，在他們的腦筋中，簡直由淡漠而幻滅得無影無踪了。</p>
<p>但是，走進賭窟之後，任何力量都不能遏止罪惡的滋長與蔓延，任何方式都不能避免產生惡果；他們挾其少許薪給所得走進去，非但絕無僥倖獲得贏資的希望，並且，還不够注擲，一輸卽光。於是，輸負之後想翻本，翻本的廣金又必輸負，一而再，再而三，愈陷愈多，其所得賴以生活的金錢，都傾囊以盡，而其生活又不能停止不食不衣，處在這樣雙重的壓力之下，歪曲的思想與行動就必然的因而產生。不久以前報載，有：銀行職員舞弊被發覺，店員侵佔被發覺，某賬房虧欠若干，以及妻女首飾衣物被典質殆盡，吵鬧不休的，眞是不一而足。而最近又見報載某綢莊夥偸竊拷綢若干疋，被判一年六月徒刑。這些現象的根苗，同樣的都是因爲報效賭窟，甚至有專以這種金錢去作賭本：結果飽嘗鐵窗風味，貽累妻兒，貽害社會，賭窟的力量眞是可怖！</p>
<p>這還是眼見的事實，其他未經報章宣佈的，更不知凡幾，其數量較徒刑幾年幾月的更要多上若干倍吧？這種社會的罪果，一方面固然是由於社會的畸形，一方面也因一般人缺乏定力，不能主宰自己，明知其必無好果還耍甘冒不韙去嘗試，何况這種賭窟還是培植於特殊勢力之下的哩！爲今之計，能根本剷除這種殺人不用刀的賭窟固好；其次也要希望、一般人猛省，勿多事迷戀，同時，希望僱主方面對於僱員的生活，行動也要加以充分的注意，寗可事前預防，不要事後力謀補救，眞是兩得其益的辦法。若因進出賭窟而致舞弊，侵佔，盜竊等，喧騰於社會，本人的入格，名譽，固然是破產了，而僱主方面也不免有管理不精密，內部組織不健全的缺點暴露。</p>

<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“Topper　Takes　A　Trip”</p>
<p>我曾經在某張影片裏提到過，就是中國影片一度也在攝製什麼妖神鬼怪的影片，它主要的動機，不能不說是受了美國影片的影響：美國影片中有恐怖片「僵屍」「古屋怪人」，我們也有「古屋行屍記」及「冷月詩魂」，人家有倫敦人狼」及「化身博士」，我們也有「化身人猿」，—以這些例子上，我們可以斷然的說，中國電影檢查會，必須堅持過去禁止放映神怪恐怖片的條例，這些影片，不單對於個人絲毫沒有好處，而它的遺害，却是更不可設想的，以中國影片公司模倣攝製神怪恐怖片的例子看，我們希望中國政府能够馬上恢復戰前的檢査制度，絕對禁止像這一類無聊，鬼怪影片。</p>
<p>「風流女鬼」一看名字，就可以想見它是包含着怎樣一個內容，這樣影片不管它是吾只是想利用攝影技巧來騙取觀衆，但是，它的客觀效果，只有一個，就是使人相信一有鬼」，對於這樣影片，却使你是再巧妙的廣吿宣傳員，你也沒有辦法說明「這是一張堂堂正正的敎育影片」！</p>
<p>所以，掉過來說，正因爲它這種歪曲的觀念，可以使觀衆麻醉，削弱中國抗戰的意志，使中國觀衆沉迷在這些神怪妖魔鬼的邪說裏面，我們同樣的要求中國政府禁止這樣影片的進口與放映。</p>
<p>「風流女鬼」可以說是「風流三昧」的續集，主演人依然是原來兩個主角：康絲登裴納與羅倫楊，故事的開頭，把「風流三昧」男女鬼的來歷重新補叙一次，以下便寫銀行家托勃因爲要找他妻子，於是和女鬼一齊趕到歐洲去。</p>
<p>故事是空無所有的，劇作者自始至終不過利用攝影技巧，使物件憑空自動，女鬼疊隱疊現，而博取觀衆的哄笑，但是，當四五次以後，那一套老戲法當觀衆看慣以後，觀衆便感覺厭倦，絲毫不感覺好笑了·而劇作者在劇本編製上，也透露出幾個弱點：（一）因爲太憑恃這些攝影技巧，它所描寫的人物，都是沒有情感的；（二）爲了只想以這些紛亂的魔術騙騙觀衆，因之劇本編製非常鬆懈，凌亂；（三）於塲面空氣始終沒有顧慮到，因此雖然女鬼還是儘量表演，但它已挑不起觀衆的興趣；（四）全劇收束，平板鬆弛，一點沒有戲劇的高潮，因此最後托勃夫妻和好，使人感覺勉强無力。</p>
<p>假如要指出一點全劇的長處，那麼以一個自以爲是貴族婦人，因爲不知道，竟和一個僕人頭腦對喝香檳酒，事後知道他是僕人，馬上站起來，臉上變了色攆他出去，用這樣諷刺筆調去寫一般人的階級觀念之深，這到是整個影片中最眞實的地方。</p>
<p>羅倫楊飾這樣角色到是很好的，康絲登裴納的女鬼，沒有特殊精彩的地方，這樣角色，我想誰都會演的。</p>

<p>爲了這件事，伺家兩位小姐很想早些兒到自由村去。聽說自由村是個新村，一切的規劃，都是新的。她們已經託朱愛人去問過她的祖父，有沒有合宜於設紡織工廠的地址？朱老源村長的回信說：『此地有的是地皮。要沿公路的也有，要沿河道的也有，水陸交通便利的也有，請何家兩位小姐，自己來相度地勢好了。不過近來自由村很爲發展，也頗有人到此地來建築工廠的，能早一些來，更爲相宜』。朱愛人便把她祖父的這番意思，給她們說了，她們更是心裹熱霍霍地，要到自由村去看看。朱愛人答應這個星期日，陪她們到自由村去。不過愛人心中有些兒躊躇，爲的自己在醫院裏，一天不能難開，不能老是陪着她們在自由村。她的母親呢？待人接物，很爲誠懇坦直。但她老實不客氣說起來，到底是個農婦出身，怎能和這兩位富豪家的千金，而父是在金元國多年的小姐，沆瀣一氣呢？除非是陪了她們去後，依然陪了她們回來，仍舊讓她們住到安樂鎭來。再不然，就是扔她們在自由村，儘牠們去瞎摸，或者老祖父有法子去招待她們，也未可知。後來被她仔細一想，也就想出一個人來。原來朱愛人有個堂房的姊姊，喚做朱愛羣，她是住在自由村的。這朱愛羣，年紀要比愛人大三歲，她也是一位助產女醫士。從前也是這裏婦孺醫院的一位看護小姐，現在當了助產醫士了。當朱老先生組織自由新村的時候，一切都是新的，鄕下人生產所用的收生婆老娘之類，已無立足之地了。產婦臨盆，不能再受那種無知識老婆子的手術。不能送往醫院裏，也得依照新法接生。可是從自由村到安樂鎮的婦孺翳院，究竟路遠一點，產婦有許多不便。那時候，自由村的村民還少，也不合算在那裏設分院，因此朱村長和章醫師商量下來，說不如派朱愛羣到自由村來吧。那朱愛羣雖是在醫院當看護，她於產科很有經騐，是章醫師所信託得過的。她又是朱老先生的姪孫女，也可謂人地相宜。她來到自由村時，愛人還沒從美國回來，也已有三年年光景了。（八三）</p>

<p>貨幣佔領與市場奪取</p>
<p>在此次戰爭以前，日本對華輪出的數量，甚不滿意。一九三六年，即和平的最後一年，日本對外國和殖民地的輸出的總數，有四萬萬買主的中國，僅佔其中的百分之四四；這數等於中國向外國所購的總額百分之一六·三。今目觀日本的輸出商在已處於日人羣固統治之下，旣無外幣干涉，而日圓已佔優勢的各地，處境如何不同！每一日本屬地，雖面積和戶口都遠在中國之下，而在一九三六年所購日本的貨物，都超過日本所常常宣布切望和她「合作」而佔世界人口最多的一國。</p>
<p>台灣是日本最老的殖民地，居民不稍過五百萬人，佔日本本部輸出總額百分之六·八。這便是說，台灣所需要的外貨，向「母國」購買百分之八三·三，向日本其他屬地購買百分之九·一，向非日本的各地所購之數，僅佔百分之七·六。朝鮮是日本的第二個大殖民地，有二千三百萬人，所購的日貨，佔日本本部輸出總額的百分之一八·五，這數等於朝鮮輸入總額百分之八五·一。其餘的輸入百分這八·七，來自其他日本屬地，所以朝鮮向外國所購之物，僅佔輸入百分之六·二，。滿洲國僅短期處於日本統治之下，還未到倚賴大哥而「合作」的理想程度，可是已向該方面大有進展。一九三零年即九一八事變發生的前一年，居民三千萬人所購的日貨，還不足日本本部輸出總額百分之六·四，但至一九三六年，已增至百分之一四·八。一九三○年日本帝國的貨物佔滿洲向外方所購的總額百分之三九·三，一九三六年已增至百分之七五·一。尚餘的百分之二二·八，由外貨經售商供給其半，其中大半是關東軍在「滿洲國」境內作軍事凖備直接或間接所用的物品。一九三六年日本三大屬地所購的日貨，佔日本本部輸出總額百分之四○·一，這年中國佔百分之四·四，完全在日本政治勢力範圍外的各國卻佔百分之五五·五。</p>
<p>就台灣朝鮮　「滿洲國」類推而作評斷，「日圓集團」統制各佔領地區和所被壓服的中國部分數年之後，至少在理想上中國將許日本帝國供給本國輸入需要百分之七○至八○左右。但是縱到那時，中國所購日貨的　數，就一九三六年戰前的根據估算，恐仍難達到日本輸出的總額百分之二○。換一句話說，日本仍在作極大努力以求壓服的四萬萬中國人所給日本輸出商的利益，不曾超過一九三六年二千七百萬臺灣人和朝鮮人所供獻的總數。縱到那時，日本總輸出的是百分之四○，仍須在「日圓集團」外的外國市場出售，那便是說，日貨輸出繼續積極擴張的主要因素，整個仍將為各外國多多購買的志願。但有一層，日本如果能將中國完全併入「日圓集團」，卻可得到一個好機會，而將中國目前較為高的經濟自給力逐漸削小，於是日本可使中國格外倚賴日本增多供給，正如日本現在懷抱這個目的縱台灣朝鮮，和她操縱「滿洲國」到了某種程度一般。話雖如此，但這件卻是遙無期的。</p>
<p>現在日本在華佔領的地方，大部份已用有名無實的方法開始併入「日圓集團」了，日人和佔領地區的貿易，現已正式稱為「日圓集團貿易，」跟日本和台灣朝鮮「滿洲國」的貿易相同。按照華北日本軍事當局頒行的條例，新設立的「聯凖銀行」的紙幣，已在廣大區域作為法定通貨，能十足掉換日圓；該銀行的金融政策，卻全操於日人之手。除「聯凖」紙幣外，原有的日圓，和「滿洲國」的紙幣，都被強定了同樣的價值，在華北流行。但是這三種貨幣合併的總數，還遠不及華北中國法幣的總數。中國法幣現仍廣行民間，絕非僅在日軍未到的內地各縣通用。牠在民間仍佔優越的地位，唱有禁令禁止再用，若不按八折掉換「聯凖」紙幣，如查見任何人行使「舊鈔票」，都須嚴懲，卻絕無效果。華華的新裝況，已使日本的輸出品乘機湧入市場。據日本正式公布的貿易報告載稱：一九三八年最前八個月，每月輸出至華北的商品，平均較一九三六年戰前高三倍北上。若運取道關東租借地間接運往華北的輸出品計算，（在戰前大批日貨曾由這條路走私運往，直至最近方才停止。）牠的總數，雖華北因遭兵變，向外國購買的總數已大見減少，然在今日似還比兩年前高出兩倍以上。華中的「日圓集團」的出現，迄今不過仗着日軍為了應付軍事和商業需要所發行的軍用票的流通，比較為多，並且正在逐步擴張的原故，但日本輸出商卻也亟亟在那里利用他們的機會。同一時期內，日本運到這些地區的輸出品，每月平均增加數，當然還小，因為境內的購買力和經濟組織，已全被摧毀；但是華中的總輸入中，日本所佔的數額，已增多四倍左右。新佔領的華南地區，日本「軍用票」已開始行用，豫料也有同樣的發展。這些進步，都是剝奪第三國和中國國貨製造商的利益而和到的。日本雖在征服的中國戰區內，藉「日圓集團」的組成，而增大日本的輸出市場，並排斥其餘各國，目前似乎已將第一個目的走上實現的途徑，但目前尚非應付第二目的不可，不然「日圓集團」卒將遭遇慘烈的失敗。</p>
<p>原料的掠奪與外匯掠奪</p>
<p>日本本部現也長久不斷地需要大量物品的輸入，尤其為日本自已不出產的原料。這便需要外匯，用以在世界存貨豐富的市場購買這些物品。日本輸入需要隨着她的軍備的增加，和工業設備的擴張，而日見其高。日本亟望依靠控制原料的新來源，和外匯的收入，而更可在輸入市面不倚賴外國。這是對華作戰的另一動機，也是希圖將「日圓集團」展至征服的土地的另一原因。由此可見關於這點的成敗，便是日本努力用「日圓集團」以求擴張輸出業的將來成敗的條件上的主要因素。就輸入物品的供給而論，日本帝國所給予的結果，不及她對輸出市場所給的優美。在此次戰事發生之前，日本本部的輸出總額，三大屬地所佔的部份如下：臺灣百分之九·八，朝鮮百分之一四·二，「滿洲國」百分之六·三，總共百分之三○·三。日本所需要的糧食，都由這三地供給，（糧食實在已佔三地售與「母國」的物品的大部份。）但三地在日本工業上所需的重要原料，和其他物品的輸入總數中所佔的部份，卻比上述數字少得多。中國在戰前對日本的輸出，佔日本本部向外方所購的總數百分之四·二，現在中國商業上最重要的城市已併入「日圓集團」，日本現正儘力利用由中國輸入更多物品的機會。但結果卻令日人失望，雖日人在佔領地區內所見有價值的物品，都能伸手摟取，將購買中國產品的外人，排斥出境；雖日人在華購物，不再需用外匯；雖日人抑價強買，或常常照國內慣行的手段，實際將東西沒收。</p>
<p>一九三八年最前八個月內，日本由華北輸入的每月平均數，比一九三六年已增高三倍半。在這時期內，華中仍有軍事的大擾亂，日本由該地區的輸入，已落至只及從前的五分之一。但一旦境內獎況和華北相近，可望有同樣的增加。最後華中的利源，也將照樣榨取。日人發展的計盡，雖有這些可能的希望，但是戰勝使日本因中國而減少倚賴其他外國供給她的需要。這又是日本利用極完美的機會，半中國併入「日圓集團」的另一原因；不但為了要將有用於日本的中國每種原料，完全榨出，並且為了要使中國儘多供給外匯，以充日本源源向外國市場購進物品的付款。所以日本的「大日圓集團」所須應付的主要問題，便是外匯。在中日戰事之前，日本帝國在外匯上是極不滿意的。今再回說一九三六年，那時朝鮮臺灣和日本本部相同，都苦外匯不足。她們由外國，即非日本國購物的總數雖小，卻仍比售給這些國的總數超過許多。一九三六年她們共結的人超數，由日本用外匯付出的，總計共達日金五千七百三十萬圓。</p>
<p>據正式對外貿易報告，同年日本自已的人超數，共日金七千零八十萬圓，但是入超的最大部份，（一九三六年日本因此不得不付出巨款，而將外匯的自由金凖備全數用盡，到了一九三六年開戰之初，又被撻開始出售巨數黃金。）是跟「滿洲國」和她在關東租借地的轉運口岸大連有關。這兩處日本屬地是「日圓集團」的發起份子，入超共達日金二萬五千八百七十萬圓。牠們出入貿易上所差之數，的確全由牠們向「母國」所購的總數，遠過牠們賣給「母國」的總數。但是因為日本本部和「滿洲國」關東租借地間的這種貿易，雙方在日本所謂對外貿易報告中都紀載不實，又因為雙方依此類推，故意將日本的入超減至至小之數，所以這個所差之數，應另列為用以彌補日本帝國和各國往來貿易上對比短少總數的三項中的最大一項，倘若「滿洲國」併入「日圓集團」，未使日本能夠將「滿洲國」和非日本的各外國交易中賣出的高額的大豆所得到的餘多外匯，提供自用，那末，上述的差數，恐怕還要增高日金一萬萬圓以上。這一點是不能忽視的。</p>
<p>日本外匯之絕對空虛</p>
<p>日本的外匯問題，現已比前更見嚴重。日本在對華戰爭的第一年，已耗去金凖備百分之五○，這些黃金不得不在海外售去，以便抵補帝國對外貿易的入超差額。再者，這一年的戰爭中，日本又為維持其積存而大量增購軍需原料，僅由此棉花羊毛美國木料這三項存貨，一已用去百分之八○，一已用去百分之七○，一已用去百分之六○。而通常需要的外國原料，更減少至不能繼續維持輸入的程度，若長此以往，那末，如含有外國原料的棉布一類日本製造品這輸出業，便有全盤停歇的危險。因此外匯問題已使日本領袖心中更為惴惴，於是他們在對「日圓集團」地區內逐步擴張輸出貿易，是否有益，也更為懷疑。輸出的貨品，內中大都含有日本須用外匯正世界市場購得的原料。對「日圓集團」地區的輸出貿易雖見膨脹，但由這此地區的輸入，卻未見隨着同等膨脹，而由賣給外國的輸出品所收的外匯。日本和她最新的屬地貿易而發生的入超的增高，現用下列的數字來表明：日本對「日圓集團」非殖民地部分的輸出，在一九三六年中，每月平均數為四千一百五十萬圓，一九三八年最前八個月中，卻已增高一倍以上，但在同時期內日本對各外國圓集團補助的非殖民地輸入的平均數，一九三六年只有日金一千九百九十萬元，一九三八年也只有四千九百萬元。日本也未以其他方法，自這些新得的地方繼續收到許多外匯「滿洲國」，由「日圓集團」外各地貿易所獲的出超上收進的外匯淨數，可當貢獻給日本的一種禮品的，一九三六年每月為日金一千三百三十萬圓，但在一九三八年最前六個月中「滿洲國」和外國的貿易每月反見入超日金二百萬圓，這須由日本撥款抵補的。日本在華北華中或可續得相當數的外匯，日方人員刻在該兩地倚賴軍隊的積極輔助，竭力設法搜括中國法幣，去換「聯凖」紙幣，或日圓紙幣，或抵付日本的輸出品，但是中政府現正實施維持法幣，使牠能夠掉換外匯的政策，因此日本所得的利益，確不甚大。法幣今仍在大多數被佔地區佔優越地位，一般人民都不願使牠流入日人之手，這一點的確是「日圓集團」在這些地區所遭的主要障礙。</p>
<p>人們只要就日本在和「日圓集團」中的新土的貿易上佔入超的地位，稍為思索，便容易了解日本實在不應該鼓勵對「日圓集團」各處的輸出理由了。她至少不將含有外國原料，或能在世界市場上，售得外匯的各項製造品運往加入「日圓集團」的各地。這些折土地，現在過於把牠們照日本內國市場的重要部份看待，在大陸和日本一般，以消極意義籌盡各種取締貿易條例，阻止將貨物賣給不能付他種貨幣，只能付日圓或倚賴日圓的紙幣的二等主顧，這不但使日本輸出商大為棘手，並且熱切提倡中日「合作」的軍人，也大為沮喪。所以日本現在覺得只有將中國的對第三國輸出，加以極充分的統制，和沒收因這種貿易所的外匯，供「日圓集團」應用，才能使日本貿易由新萌芽的貨幣同盟得到種種利益，這些利益將為勝利的所得品。</p>
<p>日方企圖將全盤毀滅</p>
<p>日本在華的進取途徑，至少目前因為不能統制中國從對第三國輸出所得的外匯收入，而被阻塞。還有一個更重要的原因，日本在華北行用的新貨幣，不過是一張紙，只能掉換另一種紙，（不可兌換的日圓。）已證明大遭失敗，所以日本躊躇不收照原定計盡，在華中行用同樣的貨幣，而將「日圓軍用票」收回。這種「軍用票」甚至不能在「解放的新中國」作為法定通貨，絕不能得到日軍槍刺所不能及的任何華人的信用。當此中國幣依然能夠掉換外匯之際，凡新貨幣，至少要有目下中國的外匯收入一部份為後援，才能得到中國法幣奮門，而逐漸廢棄牠的同等機會。所以日人在對華戰爭中要得到經濟上的勝利，假使他們能夠得到的話，還有一個惡圈，須得打破：他們因為不能操有使輸出品流動的中國貨幣，使不能統制中國對第三國的輸出貿易；他們因為中國法幣的固有價值，遠過他們所行用的代替物，便不能統制或銷毀中國的「舊幣」；他們因為在中國法幣還未完全破壞之際，倘要創行一種更佳的代替物，唯一顯明的方法，必須使這種代替物能夠自由掉換金圓，或金鎊。在日前狀況中，只能用中國物產運到外國，才能掉換到手，所以他們要創行此中國法幣更佳的代替物，是辦不到的。日人現用槍刺施於這種工作，想滅少中國物產流往世界市場，不但未能收效，反而鼓勵牠們輸出。所以在華建設「日圓集團」，距離完成的地步，還遠著哩。無論今日晶本和她常固統制的屬地一方面，跟在華所估地區另一方面，有什麼經濟上的和財政上的密切關係，這種關係依然完全以日軍野盡力量為根據；密切貨幣同盟較精明而更有強制性的力量，尚未真正實現。兩國間告成一種「和局」，縱然這種和局允口本統御中國的慾望如願以償，也難望使這此狀況發生迅速的變更。</p>
<p>同時，日本目下正用武力將那些經濟政策至少安下基礎，希望「日圓集團」的貨幣機構終得平順地，有效地，近乎自動地進行，而使對中國或第三國方面的利益的侵佔，不過分顯露；且正在凖備使華籍屬員用「新中國」名義，實施現代統制外匯的方法，以代目前日本陸海軍官慣行的橫暴干涉貿易和產業的手段。一種精細歧視的官僚制度——如熱照，限額，取締條例，捐稅和稅則的操縱手段，信用放款的條例等等，日本已將這一切在她國內和她的屬地中發展成她自已極有成績的最近封建主義，連同所已給予日本的兩大專利企業，即（華北華中開發會社）的大權，現已悄悄地計謀告成日本所抱的志願。這不外將中國化為日圓集團的一個主要部分，像台灣朝鮮「滿洲國」一般；將有用於日本的中國各種物產從事發展；將其他各物現在或將來可和日本工來發生的競爭，化為烏有；將戰前中國遠大而日見滋長的自給力，轉為完全倚賴日本；將中國和日圓集團外的世界彼此經濟的往來，減至適合日本自已需要的程度。但是日本想對中國和奠定已久的泰西利益獲得這種經濟的勝利，前途茫茫，一時還難達到目的，因為泰西的利益和中國現代的進步，密切結合，已在全國成了個正正當當獨立的單位。即使日本因為泰西的抵抗或不能維持中國自已的長期抗戰，終能告成這經濟的勝利，然日本經濟的問題，要在「大日圓集團」內獲得解決，似乎仍然毫無把握的。</p>

<p>— 張肖梅</p>
<p>張肖梅博士，係中外聞名這經濟學家，歷任中國銀行經濟研究室主任，並主辦中國國民經濟研究所，最近籌備成立之國立西南經濟研究所副主任一席，聞亦已聘定張博士担任。該篇係張博士新編「中外經濟年報」中之一章，該報由中國國民經濟研究所出版，承張博士於該年報未出版前，先賜本刊發表，並已於上月廿日本刊開始披露。首段論述經濟為現代戰爭之成敗關鍵，而指明經濟外交之重要。次段係記述國際間經濟上對於抵制侵略運動這展開。第三段係分別觀察我國一年來經濟外交之成就，當時僅述及中美之外交關係，中英·中法之經濟關係，延至本期，始得續佈，實因篇幅有限，無可如何，故特摘述上文要點，俾得前後照應，遷延之處，尚盼作者與讀者鋻諒為幸。</p>
<p>中英　自全面抗戰發動，吾國沿海口岸均受威脅。天津上海，首當其衝。對外貿易重心，初則移於華南，賴香港為啓齒。然廣州形勢，旦夕可危，卒至不保。故政府自始即亟亟於另徯徑，洞開「後戶」，俾外來供給，及土產輸出，仍得流暢無阻。</p>
<p>滇緬公路，早有其議。而英方貫通長江上游貿易之心，蓄意亦久。然必待抗戰之推動，乃以數十萬人之日夜工作，不數月而全綫完成，於三八年七月通車。於是中英經濟合作，得更進一步。</p>
<p>自滇緬公路通行，復盛傳英國將與借款，建設滇緬鐵道。及日本公然推翻九國公約，提出所謂　東亞新秩序一，明白排斥外商權益，英美方取聯合行動，有對日報復之議。十二月六日字林西報倫敦消息，謂中政府計劃建設華西鐵道一千哩，已向英利茲Leeds公司定鋼板車八五○輛，並另定建築用鐵軌二十五哩，備先行接通昆明大理再謀擴展。</p>
<p>十二月十五日哈瓦斯社倫敦消息，確謂中英借款已獲原則上協定，廢與中政府借款一千萬鎊，作下關（雲南近大理）至滇緬邊境鐵道建設之用。鐵路計劃，全由英商經理，並由出口担保局協助之。然聞鐵路費用，僅六百萬鎊，餘四百萬鎊，可購其他鐵路材料及載重車用。此外又傳　年英國貨華這信用，僅五十萬鎊而最近成立之中央匯兌平凖基金五百萬鎊新新借款，始為英國決以財力助華聲云。</p>
<p>英美借款，雖係商業性質，然亦不無政治意味，故吾全國與論，一致歡迎，如婦納之，凡五點：（一）當此抗戰轉入第一時期之際，外國借款，無論大小，均可鼓勵人民而奮發士氣；（二）表明英美友誼；（三）鞏固吾人尊　債信之堅心:（四）其中政治性質，頗可注意：（五）勢必引起日方反對，但吾人日益信力足打破侵略者亞洲帝國之迷夢也</p>
<p>中法　中法國交，素極良好，據五月七日密勒氏談論報　所載，「西南歡迎外資」（作者Wong　Hin）文內，謂「有法國銀團，與川黔鐵路公司成立借款。鐵路管理，全歸川黔公司。僅於建築期內，聘兩法籍專家監督工程。一切材料，均於公開市場採辦之；借款担保，由中國建設銀公司（完全華經經營）為惟一担保人。債務收交事宜，另由鐵路公司提名組織之債務委員會協助何證之一。又據紐約著名之遠東雜誌Far　Eastern　Survey　五月二十八日論法國在華操益文內，表示此項款，計中國國幣三千四百五十萬元，其中七百萬元付現，餘二千七百五十萬元購料云。</p>
<p>上項借款辦法，純為商業之投資而革除任何附帶條件，實開中外經濟合作之先例。在四南鐵路計劃中，有自廣西南寗至越南邊境者，關係法人利益量重。今英美借款，已開其端故法國即有響應之說。</p>
<p>在戰爭破壞之中，而猶獲得列強之信用與援助，而日方對世界之活動，所得者僅一至之斥責，此因為吾國戰時經濟外交之成就，實亦由於吾國之抗戰，乃係任何民族獨立生存上應有之使命；並為確保東亞和平，乃至世界各國之對華戰時經濟之合作，宜其正節節進步中也。</p>

<p>— 浮石生</p>
<p>（一）生意經</p>
<p>商業中的生意經，有似波譎雲詭，誠如龍駒生君所說「戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。」而我們呢絨業的買賣成交，與紗業的變化內幕，自然又不同了。現在先來談變買賣成交的一番生意經吧！不論行號與廠家跑街掮客賣方，持樣子四出兜攬，除人人知道的嶄貨便宜貨外，莫不均說新到貨，新出品，新花色的。一經買方「指選欲用談論行情，」皆謂：到存限，風行暢銷，某號會欲吸收龔斷，曾還何價而不售；某某二號已添購二次矣；某分或一角一類的話。如遇陳舊花色則云：前途當初不願廉價，某某等號俱還何價不肯，目下需款急欲脫貨求財，確實虧本削價，欲購真是好機會，捷足先得，免致向隅。倘價算不來，售與某號價幾何，尚稱不必宣揚。譬如「購一二疋，」又說：這是足下的面子，照律拆疋酌加。又如事實上默認蓋印或用支票，又云：如他家必非現款辦不到。反之買方客戶，其遇悅意合胃者，大半必多回說不要，硬　「搭架子，」因其心欲要殺價也。總之這種生意經，均皆爾欺我詐，甚之出賣人格向人發誓的亦有之，亦可見「生意經」之奸僞百出，大弄玄虛。新近時局大變，各人多覺得這不是商業道德所應有，虛浮習氣，理應革除，精誠相孕，方是真正「生意經」呢！</p>
<p>（二）　批貨</p>
<p>批原箱子貨，價目自較拆疋為公道，因一箱四疋或六疋，花色多不能移動，故非大戶寗願售零。　批貨十之八九，成交後先剳碼單，先付款後出貨，匯劃照市貼水（或者事前聲明完全現鈔，）而其先送貨後收款者亦有之，但真究甚寡。碼單剳後，一星期不出清，須付定洋，在發票上註明半月或二十天出清，否則定洋沒收。反之如貨他售，就要照定洋數目加一倍或二倍賠償損失。但旣付定不洋，不出或他售，實在很缺（然未付定洋者，遭遇市面好歹暴動，雙方則常有發生糾葛聞見。）新近此等付寂洋限期出貨則辦不到了，因現在時市變化，非當日及二三天內現墊出清，一律不肯剳付碼子矣。</p>
<p>（三）三零疋貨</p>
<p>因可挑選顏色，故其價較　批每碼酌加一角左右。賣方多送到買方，車力不論多寡，均由賣方負担。或現鈔或支票，或匯劃或回單，均於售時言明。開價視款之種類為轉移，自然以現鈔交易為合算耳。疋頭貨送貨，買方門檻精明者，大半均欲覆量碼尺，照歷來常規，一疋中短少半碼以上可以除之，半碼以下衹好買方吃虧，因定貨洋行規矩，原疋二頭有印鑑，凡短少半碼以下者，不能打义子也。因零疋貨多將貨送到並附發票（事先未剳碼，）故不時有生變化。賣方遇貨俏價漲，有出高價者即他售，或缺送一色一疋，甚或推說貨已被捷足先得矣，或被別人扣定，價須增加若干（其有信譽之店號決不出此。）而買方因無憑證，自難理論。掉轉來說，忽生變意，卽推說身骨有差，花色略異，或割價或退貨，這一番手續，乃　批整箱貨所無，俗云「嘴邊一粒飯，牙吧扣地樸」之謂也。</p>
<p>（四）現期貨</p>
<p>所謂現貨者，即貨在佔中或棧中，成交後馬上交割清楚（其由客方緩約幾天亦有之。）期貨者即指貨尚未到埠，預先拋售，言明凖約半月或一月，待貨到再交割，先剳約碼為憑，倘遇市面變化及約期有失，雙方常有食言的事發生，故同業中對於期貨交易，邇來頗見缺乏。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 琴</p>
<p>四月七日，在今年是耶穌受難的日子；同時恰巧也是滬江大學校長劉湛恩博士殉難的週年紀念日。耶穌為世界人類而犧牲，劉博士為國而犧牲。耶穌以博愛的精神而犧牲了自已的性命。耶穌雖死了一千九百三十八年，而全世界人還是紀念他；劉博士是耶穌的信徒，他受到耶穌的感化，以博有的精神，來辦理教育，改造社會。劉博士之死，是值得我們紀念的！</p>
<p>劉博士平時常常對人說的有三句話，而這三句話是他終身奉行的：</p>
<p>第一句是　要積極不要消極</p>
<p>第二句是　要合作不要破壞</p>
<p>第三句是　要犧牲不要利已</p>
<p>他又認為惟樂觀可以戰勝悲觀，惟觀可以戰勝消極，亦惟東觀可以戰勝困難！所以他對於處世接物，總是以積極的精神，和樂觀的態度，去戰勝一切困難！</p>
<p>我們中國人是缺少組織的能力，缺乏合作的精神，做一椿事，總是主鳳太深，利已心太重；每每意見紛歧，互相傾軋，以至破壞了事，劉博士看到這一點，常常在聲疾呼，來警惕國人。</p>
<p>劉博士已經死了！可是他的那種積極的思想，合作的態度，犧牲的精神，是永遠不會消滅的。我們今天固然應當要紀念他，追思他：我們尤其要景仰他，效法他。</p>
<h3 id="c136">難民職業教育的重要及其改進 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 高步階</p>
<p>沂來上海的一般民衆對於難民的印象似乎很不好，時常聽得有人憤慨地說：「吃了睡，睡了吃，有工不願做，有錢不要賺，吃苦更談不到，某公館到收容所裏請的娘姨三天就跑回去了某公司在收容所裏僱的工人二天就不願做了，……這成什麼話呢？難民簡直成了懶民。」不錯，這些確是事實，衹要稍為關心難民間題的人們都可以知道。究其原因。第一，收容所裏的職員太不負責任。第二，有一部分的確是貪吃懶做，懶惰成性的乞丐游民，混在各個收容所裏。第三，大部分的難民，因為受到了重大的災刦，神經刺擊過度，失去了固有的理智，沒有了原來的自信，對於生活尚毫無興趣，工作自然更談不到了。於是「睡了吃，吃了睡，有工不要做，有錢不要賺……」的沉淪下去了。</p>
<p>本來，這次的救濟難民，與平時辦理養老院，殘廢院，救濟院的慈善事業完全不同。第一，這次被難的對象大部是有業有家的良民，國家民族的中堅。第二，這次戰區遼闊，災民衆多，在這一切物力集中用於抗戰建國的大業上的時候，政府固無巨款賑濟難民，捐募亦因戰期久遠，難免有窮盡之患，第三，這次破壞酷烈，災情　重，大部份難民都已傾家蕩產，損失殆盡，目前的衣食住雖然靠人救濟，暫無問題，但戰後的生活如何維持，卻是成為嚴重的問題。所以這次的救濟難民，不單是消極地供給難民的給　，維持他們荀延殘喘的生活，就算盡了責任，進而要教消極成為積極，化懶惰者為動勞，訓無能者有技術，使無不者得業，最後使這些本來靠人維持的難民能逐漸達於自給自養，在目前為抗戰建國有用的門士，在戰後為自力更生的新民。</p>
<p>怎樣達到上面所說的目標呢？一句話，積極推進難民職業教育，難民職業教育是救濟難民頂重要的一部門，也是頂根本的一部門。救濟難民假使忽視難民職業教育就失掉了救濟的意義，結果，難民目前雖稍受恩惠，但對國家民族非但毫無裨益，而且徒然多消耗一分力量，在目前加重抗戰建國的國難，在以後增多一批懶惰的游民。唯有積極地推進難民職業教育，才是救濟帶難民的要着。</p>
<p>過去一年中，上海各收容所主管機關，雖然也有難民職業教育的設施，可是大多聊以點級，不加重視，而且辦法欠妥，負責乏人，因之收效極小，最近社會人士對於難民的批評，便是很好的證據，筆者一年來負責推進上海各收容所難民職業教育，對難民職業教育認識較多，茲不揣谫陋，對難民職業教育今後應行改進各點，略述管見如後：</p>
<p>（一）鞏固行政地位，充實指揮力量。</p>
<p>過去各收容所主管機關，雖然也有職業教育組生產教育組的設立，但地位低微，形同虛設。雖然也有負責推進的人員，但毫無行政權力，無法對各收容所發號施令。因此各收容所對難民職業教育大多採取敷衍塞寶的態度，對於上級的各項計劃及設施，往往一延再延，一誤再誤，經數星期而毫無結果。例如：要在某收容所舉辦某種生產工作，請該所挑選若乾難民以便訓練，起初滿口答應，後來，或說地方太小，或說工資太低，或說難民不願學習，種種推托，雖然推行者費盡心力，結果還是一無所成。這種情形，對於担負此項責任的管理員應該給予相當的懲戒，或則警告，或則記過，或則免職，但因難民職業教育本身行政地位低微，推行者當然也無權執行此項任務了。所以今後的難民職業教育，在各收容所主管權關之行政組織中應特設部門，確立地位，並須訂立詳細辦法，充實指揮力量，這是最重要的一點。</p>
<p>（二）增加工作人員，實行分工合作。</p>
<p>難民職業教育的範圍極廣，如職業調查，職業介紹，職業訓練，職業輔導，生產品推銷等工作都包括在內。而每種工作的內容，又極複雜，例如：職業訓緡，就有徵集工人，舉行登記，設法地點，籌劃經費，及聘請技師等手續，又如職業介紹，也有徵求，登記，接洽諸手續。難民職業教育的工作旣是這樣的繁重，當然決非一二個人所能包辦，但過去各收容所的主管機關，就犯着這種錯誤，調查，介紹，訓練，視導推銷等等，完全推在一二人推行者的肩上。全上海的難民所這麼許多，所處的地方這種散漫，需要職業教育又這樣迫切，今天辦訓練，明天辦介紹，今天跑收容所，明天跑各廠家，這裏那裏，這樣那樣，試想教一二人如何辦得了？難童佔難民總數不過十分之一二，但負責推行難童教育者倒有數十人之多，而需要職業教育的成人難民不下五六萬，負責推行者僅一二人（以紅十字會國際教育委員會為例），甚至一人都沒有，由其他人員兼職。試想這樣的辦法，怎樣會有成績？所以增加工作人員是推行難民職業教育的當前急務。而且某人担任某職，尤須劃分清楚，分配妥當，絕對厲行分工合作，以收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>（三）各收容所應特設職教部門，指定專職人員。</p>
<p>過去難民職業教育，主管當局旣甚忽視，所以在收容所中亦毫無地位，其組職大都附屬在管理系下，沒有專門負責的人員。只有極少數的收容所設有生產管理員，但是他們的工作，也不過每天收取生產提成罷了，因此每當有所接洽　時候，總是張三推李四，沒有一個人肯負責完全的責任。難民職業教育的推進，當然有賴於主管機關的策劃和督促，但各收容所的切實的協作，認真辦理，更為重要。所以今後各收容所，應　職業教育如同管理，給養，衛生，總務一樣的設立部門，指定專責人員，以便推進。</p>
<p>（四）籌集固定經費。</p>
<p>經費為事業之母，有經費而後可以使事業順利推進，迅速發展，否則　人均善，而困難必多。難民收容所本身是受人救劉的團體，自然是有經費辦理各項生產事業，因此所有各收容所生產事業的經費，應由主管機關統　籌劃，集中保管，此項經費一經籌定，不准動用，專供設施難民職業教育之用。過去各收容所因　要辦理生產事業而請求主管機關設法幫助，往往因沒有固定經費，不能實現，這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>（五）多　職業訓練。</p>
<p>過去辦理難民職業教育，注重介紹，訓練工作因限於經費，很少舉辦。但「八一三」後，各工廠，各商號，倒閉的倒閉，緊縮的緊縮，失業者比比皆是，在此情形之下，要想大量地為難民介紹工作，當然也是不可能的事。因此一年以來，十數萬難民中，能獲得工作者不到十分之二，今後必須多多舉辦各種訓練班，如草織訓練，編結訓練，縫紉訓練，理髪師訓練，印刷工訓練，汽車駕駛修理，無綫電收發等等，造就專門人材，開拓工作機會。使他們在目前獲得生產機會，到戰後有自力更生之能力，真是一舉兩得的辦法。</p>
<p>（六）多與各方聯絡。</p>
<p>難民職業教育，不是救濟機關內部的事業，而是整個社會的一環，不單在小小的收容所裏進行，而且要向廣大的社會發展，倘使辦理難民職業教育僅僅在收容所裏兜圈子，定難達到預期的目的。因此必須多方聞絡，各方進行。今後負責推行難民職業教育的行政當局，最好發起組織難民職業教育協進會一類的委員會，聯絡上海各業團體，定期舉行集會，多多交換意見，共商推進辦法，這樣，才不致徒勞無功，一無成就。</p>
<p>以上所述，僅憑筆者一年來之經騐，貢獻一得這愚，是否有當，尚祈高明者予以指正為幸！</p>
<p>（編者按　步揩先生意見，大可參考，本會善後處，昨日開會，關於難民職教事宜，討論頗久，蒙職教社潘仰蕘先生暨本市工商界領袖與新聞界人士等不吝賜教，已紀錄在案，着手實施，至於籌集固定經費問題更由本會理事奚玉書先生等經半月努力，募得成數，儲存備用，此後倘各界人士能時賜教言並予合作，則難民問題必可得一適當之解決也）</p>

<p>— 自立</p>
<p>有能力的難民應該登記</p>
<p>受戰事影響而家產灰燼無以為生住在收容所內做難民，是應當的，宜乎受慈善機關來給養，沒有吃，自有米送來，沒有穿，自有衣服送來，雖然不是吃好着好，卻也總可說無凍餒之虞了。但是上海的難胞，也應該想想，你們吃的着的，從什麼地方來的呢；從天下掉下來的嗎？當然不是呀，你們所服用的一切，都是社會上的熱心人士捐助的呀，在現在，有許多人們，每天為你們奔走勸募，有許多人，為你們節省費用，打算用儲蓄方法救濟你們，有許多人在營　上抽成，來幫助你們，甚而至於許多小學生，也在為你們在節省糖果費用。你們想想看，這些人的同情，是多麼寶貴呀！他們出錢，一方面想維持你們的生活，一方面還想你們能從苦難的生活中，能自立起來，俾減輕國家社會的負担，而羣力為社會謀福利。</p>
<p>所以難民救濟協會善後處就秉承這個意思，辦理難民善後事宜，難民須要做事的可以介紹職業，諸如此類，舉凡能解決難民問題的，善後處皆在着手辦理，難民大約很要聽吧。</p>

On the 7th and 8th, there were fierce battles. Guerrilla forces rose up everywhere with great momentum. The Japanese army is greatly frightened. The provincial government has increased the number of civil self-defense brigades to strengthen the national defense of the western Jiangnan Route. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Miluo: Junshan in Dongting Lake fell into Japanese hands after Yuezhou. For several months, Japanese boats harassing both banks of Dongting often sailed from the island.

They engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army occupying the island. The Japanese army initially did not expect the sudden arrival of the Chinese surprise troops and were killed by the Chinese army in numbers exceeding 100. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled to Yuezhou by boat. The residents saw the blue sky and white sun again, vying to offer fresh carp from the lake and fragrant tea from the island to comfort the righteous army. (9th Telegraph)</p>

A part of the Chinese army held each hill, and another part attacked the rear of the Japanese army. The Japanese army was trapped in heavy encirclement and did not dare to engage in close combat, so they fled in panic. On the night of the 6th, the Japanese army launched attacks on Fotangshan and Qianhouqiaozi in three routes. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army on the northeastern highlands of Zeshancun, but was unsuccessful after several hours of fierce fighting.

<p>(Chongqing) Fei Xiu, secretary of the National Association of Chinese Christian Youth Association, recently telegraphed President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Lonergan, expressing his opposition to the provisions of the New Neutrality Law. The original telegram stated, "The Pittman Neutrality Law is beneficial to Japan and harmful to China. American nationals in Chongqing were shocked and bewildered upon learning of it. Sino-American friendship has been greatly hindered as a result. Free China has made tremendous progress economically and industrially. If the United States can reverse its past actions and not supply the enemy of China with various necessary military supplies, and not further aid the enemy of China morally and financially, then China's future is indeed infinitely bright. However, the United States has hitherto ignored its moral and treaty rights and has failed to enact legislation sufficient to increase China's resistance. We deeply regret it. We believe that all goods that can be used in wartime should be prohibited from being transported to aggressor countries. At the same time, the United States should increase its assistance to China."

<p>Yichang: A reporter arrived at the Shayang front line for inspection on the 8th. While riding a horse, artillery battles were raging on both sides of the river. The sound of shells passing slowly could be heard constantly. Along the way, the people were farming freely. Although the sound of guns and artillery filled the sky, the people were still conducting small businesses near the trenches. This calmness and their spirit of helping the army in the war of resistance are deeply admirable. The morale on the front line is also very high. Then I went to the Han River bank to look at the first line, and I could remotely see the Japanese camp at Luohan Temple on the east bank. In the midst of the dense gunfire of the Chinese, a Japanese soldier was shot and fell to the ground, and there was a general appearance of panic and disorder. Along the river, the Chinese fortifications are extremely solid. Since the Chinese launched a full-scale counteroffensive in recent days, crossing the river to attack everywhere, the Japanese are overwhelmed and feel extremely threatened. On the evening of the 8th, after the Chinese army crossed the river from more than a dozen places, the Japanese army in Duobaowan, Chaojiakou, and other places suffered extremely heavy casualties. A part of Zhangjiegang has been recaptured by the Chinese army. One route of the Chinese army advanced to the vicinity of Yonglong River, and another route occupied the Yuxin River south of Wamiaoji. North of the Hanyi Highway, Yangzi Town was recaptured. Zhongxiang is under siege by the Chinese army. The favorable situation in the war in central Hubei has unfolded here. (9th Telegraph)</p>
<p>Yicheng: The Chinese army on the west bank of the Xiang River crossed the river on the 7th and launched a fierce attack on Sanhechang in Sigang City.

On the 8th, 700 Japanese soldiers with seven artillery pieces counterattacked the Chinese at the Yonglong River. The fighting was fierce, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. They are still in a standoff. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Anti-Aggression Bloc and China <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Will China join the anti-aggression bloc?</p>
<p>This question involves many aspects, and none of those aspects have so far expressed themselves. Fundamentally, this is because the organization of the anti-aggression bloc is only just beginning and lacks a clear outline. As an American figure, according to a Reuters report yesterday, felt, "Efforts are still needed to complete the work of this organization", meaning there is still a distance to go before completion. Because of this, although the question is complex and far-reaching, it is still too early to demand a definite answer from the relevant parties. According to a London dispatch, the British House of Commons will reconvene on the 19th of this month, at which time Labour MP Mr. Henderson will question Prime Minister Chamberlain about whether the government intends to invite China to join the anti-aggression bloc. That time is still ten days away. Given the ever-changing international situation, which can change in an instant, even a short period of ten days can feel like a long night with many dreams. Whether Mr. Henderson will ask this question at that time, or how he will ask it, cannot be foreseen today. And whether that time will have already become the time for demanding a definite answer from the British government is difficult to say.</p>
<p>After lamenting the failure of Mr. Chamberlain's appeasement policy, we were full of hope that the organization of the anti-aggression bloc would be completed satisfactorily. As the facts show, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck returned from his visit to England, and a historical creation was formed between England and Poland, enabling the anti-aggression bloc to realize its first ring. Much effort was expended, and the result cannot be called nothing. However, it is still far from the ideal bloc. At this very moment, Italy is using force against Albania, capturing it in one fell swoop, as easily as taking something out of a pocket. The Mediterranean situation has undergone a dramatic change. The key to the Adriatic Sea has now fallen into their hands. Aggressor countries have achieved their goals, while small and weak countries have suffered the tragedy of living or dying at their whim. Yugoslavia is in a panic, and Greece is trembling. In short, their aggressive arrogance is like the prelude to conquering everything. This is getting closer and closer to the stage of hegemony. The comfort that the Anglo-Polish achievement has given to anti-aggressors has been erased by the Italian aggression. As diplomacy bends and violence diverts, will those who decide the fate of international control be the first to complete the organization of the anti-aggression bloc, or will aggressive actions first achieve their goals through piecemeal attacks? Apart from a deep self-confidence based on justice, optimism should not be lightly indulged.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that justice will ultimately prevail, and we have no doubt that the organization of the anti-aggression bloc will ultimately be realized. If the bloc is a European bloc, it has nothing to do with China, and there is fundamentally no need to question whether China should join. However, we are not convinced that the lessons of aggression and violence in recent years are not enough to awaken the delusions of complacency and isolation, and local security. In other words, any act of aggression that spreads to any corner outside of Europe cannot possibly fail to affect Europe, and Europe cannot possibly maintain its safety and equilibrium. This is an impossibility. The reason why European powers are powers, although originating in Europe, is that their strength and life are sustained outside of Europe. Therefore, in its meaning, interests, and practical effect, the organization of the anti-aggression bloc must have aggression and anti-aggression as two opposing entities, and it cannot be divided by continent. To emphasize continental boundaries would only reward aggression outside the boundaries, and would also encourage aggression of a larger scale and scope. The advance of aggression outside the boundaries would only allow the aggressive arrogance inside the boundaries to be echoed and become increasingly rampant, and would only make the anti-aggression measures inside the boundaries more constrained and difficult. China's Hainan Island, irrelevant to current military strategy, cannot escape disaster. The new Nansha Islands between Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines, long known as pending cases, have suddenly changed hands. It is precisely that the advanced contacts in aggression and anti-aggression occurred outside of Europe, having direct and indirect relations with the various countries of Europe.</p>
<p>European anti-aggression politicians are not unaware of this. It is just that China is currently being invaded and is already engaged in a war of anti-aggression. At present, anti-aggression politicians, with their unawakened dreams of preventing aggression through peace, are probably unwilling to hastily promote anti-aggression outside of Europe and fall into the vortex themselves. Therefore, it is a natural conclusion that those organizing the anti-aggression bloc do not want to invite China to join in the early stages. In China, we are not only full of hope for the completion of the anti-aggression bloc in Europe or any region, but we must also regard ourselves as strong members of the anti-aggression front. If the scope of the anti-aggression bloc exceeds Europe, then China's willingness to participate is undoubtedly beyond question. However, the anti-aggression organization on the other side has only just begun, and even among those anti-aggression politicians, there is no evidence of frankness and sincere cooperation. Therefore, as for what its future holds, we can only observe its development with enthusiasm and quietness. Here, we have been fighting for anti-aggression for 21 months, and the conditions for winning victory are becoming increasingly abundant, and the time for final victory is getting closer and closer. Therefore, apart from focusing on continuing the war of resistance, we naturally have no expectations for the completion of the anti-aggression bloc. Moreover, although Europe and the Far East, and even the entire world, each have their own historical and geographical systems, the political and economic realities are intertwined and inseparable. Therefore, today, as China's war of resistance enters its second phase and Europe's anti-aggression movement is still in its first phase, each has its own tasks and its own urgency. However, the final control of the international situation must treat Europe, the Far East, and the entire world as one complete question. If countries still act independently, each pursuing its own interests, even if a situation of temporary peace is achieved through individual solutions, the international situation is still a unified problem. Therefore, the efforts of all countries must be gathered on the same foundation to seek a comprehensive solution. Clearly making aggression and anti-aggression in all parts of the world as opposing entities is the beginning of a comprehensive solution.</p>

This is the natural result of Japan's implementation of its policy of closing the door of China and eliminating the interests of third countries. According to the newspaper's editorial, if foreigners want to maintain the interests of third-country nationals in China: (1) Britain and France must implement the various resolutions of the League of Nations to aid China; (2) Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and other countries must convene a Pacific Land Defense Conference to discuss business preferences and military cooperation methods, and the United States must also be invited to participate in the conference; (3) Britain and France must take economic retaliation measures against Japan; (4) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must establish close cooperation in the Far East.

<h3 id="e14">Results of Japanese Control of Industry: Cotton Industry in Chaos, Cotton Exports Decreasing Daily, Tsuda Urges Government Relief <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Shingo Tsuda, president of the Kanegafuchi Cotton Spinning Company of Japan, recently urged the Japanese government to review the "short-sighted" measures of its industrial control. According to Tsuda, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese cotton industry has fallen into chaos due to the government's various financial controls, such as restrictions on domestic cotton consumption, the linking system for import and export industries, the cotton money allocation system, and restrictions on cotton shipments to the three northeastern provinces and the North China Yen Bloc. Domestic cotton mills have also suffered losses due to a shortage of labor. Although these situations are temporary phenomena during wartime and are inevitable, the control measures have not been effectively implemented. For example, under the linking system, only one type of Japanese raw-colored cloth is exported in large quantities, and unscrupulous foreign merchants take advantage of the regulation that forces exports within a specified period to drive down the price of Japanese cotton cloth. As a result, cotton exports declined in value last year. In 1938, Japanese cotton textile exports totaled 2,180,000,000 square yards, worth 404,000,000 yen, compared to 2,640,000,000 square yards worth 573,000,000 yen in 1937, a decrease of 464,000,000 square yards worth 169,000,000 yen. The most important reasons for this are as follows: (1) Restrictions on raw cotton imports have led to a shortage of cotton; (2) Overseas Chinese boycotts of Japanese goods; (3) The exclusion of Japanese goods from the British economic bloc; (4) The recent development of the cotton industry in British India; and (5) The decline in purchasing power of major producing countries in the world.

<p>(Rome) The semi-official Stefani News Agency recently issued a message stating that Foreign Minister Ciano and the Albanian Minister to Italy, Solegi, flew to the Albanian capital at 11:00 AM this morning. The former Albanian Regent Sabeya personally welcomed them at the airport and assured the Foreign Minister that the Albanian people were loyal to Prime Minister Mussolini. The Foreign Minister immediately replied that the Prime Minister was willing to bring happiness and peace to the people within the Albanian national institutions. The Foreign Minister then inspected the local infantry units and machine gun companies at the airport. In addition, Aviation Minister Valle also flew there this morning. (9th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Newspapers here are very angry about foreign news agencies and newspapers. The semi-official Piccolo newspaper published an editorial entitled "Defensive Action," defending the Italian army's invasion of Albania. It first criticized Albanian King Zog's inconsistent measures and threatening attitude towards Yugoslavia, and then said that patriotic Albanians had turned to Italy. Italy sent troops to land in Albania based on the obligations stipulated by the 1920 Ambassadors' Conference in order to restore order and justice. It also mentioned the oppression of Italian residents in Albania, saying that Italy's move was a legitimate act of self-defense and also to prevent the spread of chaos in the Balkans. Fortunately, Yugoslavia and Italy faithfully contacted each other to uncover the conspiracy, and Italy was able to contribute to European peace. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>

The Munich Observer's large headline read, "Today's history is moving forward at the speed of a fast train," and said that this year's Easter is the day when the miraculous resurrection of the German nation is realized.

<p>(Berlin) The semi-official "German Political and Foreign Communications Report" praised Italy's invasion of Albania, stating, "From a cultural point of view, Albania has returned to the barbaric era. It is necessary for Italy to send troops to restore order and safeguard its natural rights. It is regrettable that a country with a penchant for chaos attempted to use Albania as a source of turmoil in Europe and persuaded King Zog to change course and abandon the long-standing Italian-Albanian friendly policy, which led to this event. As far as the German attitude is concerned, there is no other way but to base it on the indelible friendship between Germany and Italy. It must be known that anything that threatens Italy, once eliminated, will strengthen the power of the German-Italian axis. At a time when Western countries are talking about war, this axis is the greatest guarantee of European peace." (8th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler said in a speech in Wilhelmshaven on the 1st of this month that the National Socialist Party Congress to be convened in September this year will be a "Congress of Peace." When German politicians were asked about the true meaning of this statement, they replied, "All problems will be solved before September this year," and peace can be celebrated at that time. Observers here are now commenting that this statement should not be taken lightly. Germany intends to resolve all outstanding issues that hinder "German peace" in one fell swoop before September. It can be seen from this that Germany and Italy seem to have drafted a whole plan, allowing Italy to take the lead by attacking Albania, while Germany provides material assistance (it was previously reported that Germany would supply Italy with military equipment and send military experts to that country, which has recently been confirmed), and then divide Europe. Albania and Greece will be included in Italy's sphere of influence, and may even be reduced to Italian protectorates. As for Yugoslavia and Spain, they will be placed under Italian control politically in a more indirect way, and under German control economically. At the same time, Germany will develop Germanism in Eastern Europe, striving to turn all the small countries between Germany and the Soviet Union into appendages before September this year. Poland has already become the "first enemy." Politicians here openly declare that Poland has only two options: either join the German-Italian axis or disappear from the map. Germany intends to incite various ethnic minorities in Poland on the one hand, and on the other hand, to make the country's borders feel uneasy, thereby forcing it to submit. As for Romania, it has signed commercial and supplementary agreements with Germany and will be allowed to be controlled by Germany in the future. Even Hungary will be indirectly oppressed. In a nutshell, according to the National Socialist Party's view, Germany should become the only armed country in Central Europe, surrounded only by several agricultural countries whose task is to supply Germany with raw materials, and whose people are not allowed to serve in the military. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The situation in Europe was recently commented on by responsible persons here. Italian newspapers all regard the Balkans as the country's "vital space," and the country has a large-scale eastward plan. The first target is Yugoslavia and Greece. The military action against Albania is the beginning. The Italian intention to attack the Greek island of Corfu yesterday has now been proven. The United Kingdom has decided to give a security guarantee to Greece and will be responsible for protecting Corfu. The British battleship "Warspite" and the cruiser "Aberdeen" left the Italian port of Saint Remo at midnight yesterday, which should be noted. In this view, Italy's attempt on Greece has been hindered by this British action, or it will change direction and step up actions against Yugoslavia, or even suddenly occupy the entire coast of the southern country so that the United Kingdom will be caught off guard. Even Germany, which originally coveted the Adriatic Sea, will retreat. (9th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, after consulting with President Roosevelt, who is currently recuperating at Warm Springs, via long-distance telephone yesterday, issued a statement saying, "Italy's act of armed aggression against Albania is a clear threat to world peace. Ignoring such events will inevitably lead to dire consequences due to short-sightedness. Every such action directly and indirectly strikes at peace-loving nations and countries around the world. At the very least, trust between nations has been completely destroyed, and the economic lives of all countries have been shaken." Although Secretary of State Hull was unwilling to explicitly state in front of the press whether Italy's actions violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact, his attitude made it clear that Italy's actions had indeed violated international non-aggression treaties. Hull repeatedly stated that Italy's "act of armed aggression against Albania is another threat to world peace." (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, after a long-distance telephone conversation with President Roosevelt (currently on vacation in Warm Springs), issued a statement to the press condemning Italy's invasion of Albania, and indicated that the United States might prohibit the shipment of munitions to Italy. He stated, "Italy's use of violence to invade Albania is another threat to world peace. The people of all nations desire that their governments lead them on the path to peace and do not wish to engage in war. Italy's actions are contrary to the will of the people. Moreover, after the successive occurrence of similar events, general confidence has been destroyed, world stability has been shaken, and the welfare of the United States has also been affected." Italy has now violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Senior US government officials are currently considering, in accordance with the existing Neutrality Act, an embargo on the shipment of munitions to that country, but a formal discussion has not yet taken place.

Once the British government provides security guarantees to Greece, it will send part of the fleet to Corfu, Greece. At that time, the majority of the British Mediterranean fleet will be concentrated east of Italy, ready to patrol the eastern Mediterranean at any time.

<p>Vatican City Pope Pius XII, during the Easter Mass ceremony held at St. Peter's Basilica today, broadcast a short speech calling for peace, stating that the disturbing and dissatisfying feelings that trouble our souls almost make us believe that the days to come will worsen, as if there will be no peace, tranquility and order in the truth. Even our children are divided due to mutual differences and partisan conflicts. When many people are unemployed, lose their livelihoods, and are easily poisoned by destruction, there is no peace to speak of. Only understanding can encourage people to move forward on the path of civilized progress. If solemnly signed agreements and oaths lose their value, then there is no peace to speak of, because this value is a necessary basis for mutual trust. Without these two, the disarmament hoped for by the public in material and spiritual matters will become less and less likely to be realized. The way to remedy this evil is for the souls of mankind to turn to Christ, because peace and justice depend on Christ. The result of peace is tranquility. Only in this way can mankind return to the right path of mutual friendship and understanding, and then all parties can respect the legitimate interests of all countries with goodwill and understanding, and not avoid sacrifices for the happiness of mankind, and each will abide by solemn oaths with the highest aspirations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Vatican City Pope Pius XII, since ascending the throne, held the Easter Mass at St. Peter's Basilica and later gave a speech via radio broadcast, condemning all kinds of actions that violate treaties and break promises. At the same time, he advocated respecting human dignity and freedom of rights, and allocating various resources in a fair manner. His speech included, "If the nations cannot understand each other, what value is there in the treaties solemnly accepted and the promises provided, then peace is hopeless, because these treaties and promises are the basis of mutual trust. Once they lose their effect, then the matter of reducing armaments, whether in material or spiritual matters, becomes more and more difficult to achieve. Without order, how can there be peace? Without justice, how can there be order? Justice is nothing more than obeying legitimate officials, and laws are aimed at general welfare. Human freedom and dignity should be respected, and the resources of the world should be distributed in a fair manner." (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) According to a telegram from the Dublin correspondent of the Sunday Times, regarding the issue of the unification of North and South Ireland, the British and American governments are conducting important talks with the Irish Republic and the authorities of Northern Ireland. "If these negotiations are successful, then in the event of future wars, the American army and navy will gain certain conveniences in Ireland." It is reported that US President Roosevelt has high hopes for the unification of North and South Ireland. Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Republic, is scheduled to visit the United States next month, and there is no doubt that he will play an important role in the current negotiations. It is also rumored that if the UK and the US can guarantee the safety of Ireland, then the Irish Republic is prepared to provide its ports for the use of American warships and merchant ships, and to allow the American army to be stationed in the country when necessary. At that time, Irish people who do not want to join the British army "can join the American army. Although Northern Ireland can maintain its original government, it should join the Irish Federal Government. The preferential treatment it enjoys in its commercial dealings with the UK should still be maintained, and at the same time, the US should grant it certain preferential treatment." (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Ottawa A recent issue of the Canadian Press newspaper stated, "When the House of Commons recently discussed foreign policy issues, a proposal made by a certain member of parliament was very noteworthy. The main point was that the UK, the US, and Canada should conclude a North Atlantic military alliance treaty and allow it to take effect in the Pacific. Several other members of parliament expressed friendship towards the US, and this tendency may replace the spirit of consultation within the British Empire. In short, within the House of Commons, the people who advocate that the UK, the US, and Canada sign a defense agreement have already gained momentum." The "certain member of parliament" mentioned in the report refers to Vancouver member of parliament Green, who initially had no reputation, but recently advocated that the UK, the US, and Canada conclude an alliance treaty to protect the Canadian coast and resist the Japanese threat. The Canadian government has not considered it. Minister of Justice Lapointe even gave a speech saying that Canada's current foreign policy is based on maintaining friendly relations with the US. US President Roosevelt also gave a speech at Kingston University last year when he received an honorary doctorate, saying that the US is very willing to cooperate in maintaining the territorial integrity of Canada. At this point, the defense authorities of the US and Canada have already been cooperating closely in practice informally. However, the US public opinion is unwilling to publicly conclude alliance treaties with other countries, even if the allied countries are American countries, and the Canadian officials are well aware of this.

<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this morning to discuss the situation in the eastern Mediterranean. It is said that it has been decided to immediately negotiate mutual assistance agreements with Greece and Turkey. In addition, the current situation of Spain after joining the Anti-Comintern Pact is also of concern to the British Cabinet. Some say that Italy has recently sent troops to Spain again, while others say that Italian troops have already begun to withdraw. There are many conflicting rumors. As far as the British government's response is concerned, the Anglo-Italian Agreement may not be declared abolished. However, after the sudden outbreak of the Albanian incident, it has to be admitted that this agreement has been destroyed by Italy. It is said that Italy will be asked to fulfill its promises and quickly withdraw its troops from Spain. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the organization of a collective security system, in addition to negotiating a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, the UK is now conducting separate negotiations with Greece, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. Regarding guaranteeing the safety of Greece, responsible officials here recently stated that the British government launched this proposal because of rumors that Italy intends to occupy the Greek island of Corfu, and had to take preemptive measures. In order to quickly establish an agreement with Greece, the French government will naturally cooperate closely with the UK. Regarding Romania, the talks between the UK and that country have to be delayed for several days because that country must first establish an agreement with Poland. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is in Istanbul, Turkey, conducting talks with Turkish authorities. If success can be achieved, it will benefit the UK through the Dardanelles. Regarding Turkey, although the UK is disputing with France over the Sanjak region, British people generally believe that the Anglo-Turkish alliance collective security organization will be formed. Regarding the Soviet Union, because Poland still has doubts about that country, talks between the UK and the Soviet Union must wait until the Polish guarantee issue is completely resolved before they can enter the decisive stage. In summary, the UK is contacting the related countries in the manner described above. Responsible officials here all believe that if the threat from Germany and Italy intensifies, all diplomatic difficulties can be solved easily. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times said that people in London now regard Italy's occupation of Albania as a very serious change in the European situation, and Italy's credibility has also suffered a major blow. Since the Anglo-Italian Agreement has been destroyed, the question of whether Britain should declare this agreement null and void has now arisen. Britain may be forced to adopt measures that it does not want to take and declare this agreement invalid. Another matter is even more important: the independence of Greece and Turkey should be maintained. Greece and Turkey are now greatly alarmed by the occupation of Albania and the concentration of Italian troops on the Dodecanese Islands. Responsible officials in London believe that if Greece is attacked, Britain will definitely provide assistance. When the British Cabinet meets, it may make a final decision on this matter. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Responsible officials here recently stated that regarding the future fate of the city of Danzig, the construction of a highway by Germany through the Polish Corridor, and other issues, Poland is still willing to consult with Germany in accordance with the 1934 Non-Aggression Pact and the 1937 Joint Declaration on Minorities to find a solution. Regarding the city of Danzig, Poland is prepared to discuss with Germany the legal status of the city after it withdraws from the League of Nations. However, if Germany wants to place the market under its sovereignty or weaken Polish rights, it will be rejected. As for unilaterally changing the current legal status of the market or recklessly invading, Poland will regard it as an invasion of its country and rise up to deal with it. Regarding the construction of a highway, Poland can allow it to be built and is willing to grant Germany certain preferential treatment, especially customs preferences, as it has done for the German railway line (which also passes through the Polish Corridor). However, its sovereignty must be maintained. Also, regarding the minority issue, the German minority in Poland has not yet engaged in widespread disturbances, but Germany's propaganda campaign has not stopped and has even intensified.

<h3 id="e40">The Cantonese Provincial Army's General Counteroffensive: Situation on the Three Fronts, Employing a Feint Attack to Confuse the Japanese, Coordinating with New Air Force to Counterattack Japanese Strongholds <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: At the same time that a major battle unfolded in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese army, drawing four regiments from various locations on Hainan Island back to Guangzhou, intended to launch a surprise attack on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, concentrating its main force in various strongholds surrounding the northeastern suburbs. Simultaneously, they employed a feint attack, advancing towards Beijie in Jiangmen, to disrupt the Chinese army's target. The Chinese side, having detected their scheme, specifically divided its forces into three routes for strict defense. Starting from the 3rd, in coordination with the new air force, they began a counteroffensive against the Japanese army's outer strongholds. The situation on the three fronts is recorded below:</p>
<p>Eastern River: The Eastern River front is the responsibility of the Wu Qigong department of the ×th Army Corps. The Huang Tao division, stationed opposite Longmen, launched a rapid assault on the strongholds of Zengcheng, Paitan, and Zhengguo via multiple routes. The Third Guerrilla Region's Luo Fengxiang designated the Bu Laoyang, Lin Junsheng, and Chen Nan detachments to move towards Boluo, Lianhexu, Changning, Longhua, and other places, crossing Niu Pi Path, Lychee Ridge, and Bo Gong Ridge to attack the right flank of Zengcheng. On the afternoon of March 30th, the Huang Tao division engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army south of Zhengguo Xu, killing over one thousand Japanese and puppet troops and seizing a large quantity of military supplies. The Bu, Lin, and Chen guerrilla teams engaged the Japanese army fiercely east of Zengcheng all day, without a decisive outcome. At 2 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, eighteen Chinese air force planes, divided into upper and lower layers, appeared over Shilong, tumbling and diving like falcons, swiftly dropping bombs, all of which hit their targets. Eight large bombs landed in Shilong, and six large bombs landed in Shitan. The Japanese army's accumulated grain, machinery, tanks, etc., were reduced to ashes. Civilian housing also suffered significant damage. As the Chinese planes departed, they scattered leaflets, advising the Japanese army to reflect immediately, and voluntarily cease fighting. Wang Ruozhou, Zhang Wodong, Yuan Huazhao, and others, the guerrilla commanders of the Fourth District stationed in Shilong, Dongguan, had previously received a secret order from Wu Qigong to simultaneously attack the rear of the Japanese army in the Eastern River area. On March 28th and 29th, the forward scouts of the Chinese army had already made contact with the Japanese army in the Lychee Ridge area of Zengcheng. The Fourth District Guerrilla immediately divided their forces into three routes to attack Dongguan, Taiping, and Shilong. The first route followed the Wan-Zhang (Mutou) Highway, pressing the attack on Liaobu and Dalang, advancing towards Dongguan City. The second route departed from Hengli and Nanshe, taking a diagonal course through Xiakou, cutting off traffic on the Wan-Long Highway. The third route went straight to Huangwuzhou from Ma Si Jutou, surrounding the back of Shilong. Zhang Woshu and Deng Tan were respectively appointed as front-line commanders. The major battle began on the 30th. The Japanese army stationed in Dongguan City was the Arakawa unit, numbering five hundred men. On the 28th, they had moved along the Wan-Long Highway towards Zengcheng, and the Suzuki unit was reassigned to take over the defense of Dongguan City, with its headquarters established at Mingsheng Middle School and the People's Education Center. On the 29th, several dozen tanks and transport vehicles arrived at Taiping in Humen, having just been unloaded from Japanese warships, and moved along the Guang-Hu and Wan-Da Highways, stored in the warehouse at the Baisha Airfield. The Taiping area was defended by the Okada unit, numbering five hundred men, along with a large cavalry squadron. When the Chinese army launched its counteroffensive on the 30th, a large number of Japanese tanks and cavalry moved out to meet the attack. The Chinese air force flew towards the enemy warehouse in Baisha and dropped bombs, two of which hit the target. At present, intense fighting is underway throughout the Eastern River area.</p>
<p>Western River: The Japanese army in the Sanshui Jiaowei area has adopted a defensive posture since March, with the majority retreating towards Foshan. Only sixty or so men remain on the Hekou front. Sanshui Station and Sanshui City each have just over one hundred men. The Japanese army in various locations such as Mumian, Makougang, Xikeng, Dengshi, and Baoling are all building defensive fortifications. Their talk of advancing on Lubaou will not be realized.</p>
<p>Northern River: Yu Hanmou, commander-in-chief of the ××th Army Corps, recently went to Guilin to attend the Southwest Headquarters Conference. The plan for defending northern Guangdong has been completely decided. The army corps stationed on the Yuehan Railway front is proceeding cautiously, adopting a defensive-offensive strategy. The railway tracks south of Juntian have all been dismantled. The front lines of Shengang, Dagangling, Maoergang, Lubaou, Baini, Luotian, Shiling, Pingshan, Xiangshan, Shijiao, Taipingchang, Zhongluotan, Fuhe, Zhengguo, and other markets that are near the Japanese army's strongholds, are where the Chinese army can act freely. In the past two months, encounters have occurred frequently. The above-mentioned locations are only thirty li from Guangzhou City, so the Japanese army is actively dispatching troops to defend the perimeter of Guangzhou. If the Chinese army carries out a large-scale general counteroffensive, Guangzhou will immediately be under Chinese army control.</p>
<h3 id="e41">North Jiangsu Chinese Army Rapidly Advances to Huaiyin; Large Detachment Crosses Hongze Lake; Japanese Planes Bombard Various Counties in North Jiangsu <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: Since the Chinese army launched guerrilla warfare and positional warfare on the North Jiangsu battlefront, the two sides have now developed a seesaw battle situation. The Chinese army has repeatedly recaptured the county towns of Funing and Huaian, but in order to seize the initiative, they have given them up. Each time, they have killed quite a few enemy troops. On the Canal front, a certain unit of the Chinese army is advancing north, and has now progressed to the Erbao area north of Pingqiao Town. At the same time, a large detachment of a certain unit of the Chinese army stationed in Sixian County, Anhui, has crossed Hongze Lake and is rapidly advancing towards Huaiyin. Further news: There are currently only two hundred or so Japanese soldiers in Huaian City. The Japanese army recently shot twenty-eight major and minor puppet officials of the puppet maintenance association in the city. There is talk of preparing to abandon Huaian.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the Yangzhou area on the southern line of the Grand Canal originally had extremely weak forces. A few days ago, reinforcements of five or six hundred men arrived, but eight or nine out of ten are "pacification troops" disguised as such. The Japanese army forbids these people from speaking. Although Zhaoguan Dam is currently occupied by the Japanese army, the Chinese side is constantly launching fierce counterattacks, and the Japanese army is really finding it difficult to hold on. The Chinese army has now advanced to a certain location three li from Zhaoguan Dam. The Japanese army is actively building defensive fortifications and has completed the construction of the highway from Shaobo to Zhaoguan Dam to prevent a general counteroffensive by the Chinese army. Also, the Kousei Saburo unit of the Japanese army stationed in Huangjiao Bridge has now been entirely transferred to Zhaoguan Dam to increase defenses, intending to hold this stronghold to the death.</p>
<p>For days, Japanese planes have been dispatched in all directions to bomb. On the 2nd, they bombed Pingqiao Town. The residents of that area suffered some casualties. At 8:45 AM on the morning of the 3rd, two Japanese planes were again spotted over Yancheng, dropping four bombs, killing and injuring many civilians. They did not flee northeast until 9:05 AM. At 9:55 AM on the morning of the 4th, another Japanese plane came to Dongtai to bomb. At 10:00 AM on the same morning, three Japanese planes returned to Yancheng and dropped eight bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses. At around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, five Japanese seaplanes came to Dongtai again and dropped seventeen bombs in succession, killing seven or eight civilians and injuring several others. Several civilian houses on the riverbank were also destroyed by the bombing.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the Tongru area is constantly attacked by Chinese guerrilla units, with contact occurring almost every day. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, thirty or forty Japanese and puppet soldiers set out from the west gate of Rugao to patrol Hongjia Village. The Chinese guerrilla unit launched a fierce attack head-on. Fierce fighting broke out between the two sides. In half an hour, the Chinese army killed four Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army fled in droves back into Rugao City, and to prevent guerrilla units from pursuing from behind, they fired three artillery shells on the west gate city wall as a warning. One shell landed in Liumen Township, injuring a local villager. It is said that the Japanese army in Tongru numbers about one thousand men, including many puppet troops mixed in.</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Current Situation of the New Capital of Xikang Province; Various Organizations Promote National Salvation Work <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Kangding Dispatch: This reporter arrived in Lu (Kangding) nearly a month ago. After several days of inspection in the provincial capital, the local situation has been roughly understood. Here is a record of what was learned from the investigation, divided into sections:</p>
<p>A Casual Discussion of the Past: Kangding was anciently the land of Sanwei. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, it was Western Qiang. During the Han dynasty, it was the Maoniu Kingdom. In the sixth year of the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a county was established, subordinate to Qinghai. During Zhuge Liang's southern expedition during the Shu Han period, he left Guo Da stationed in Yutong to appease the people. Da set up a furnace in the Kangding Mountains to make arrows. This is the origin of the name Dajianlu (arrow-making furnace). During the Jin dynasty, it was Western Rong. During the Tang dynasty, it was subordinate to Tubo, and the tea-horse trade became increasingly frequent. The Five Dynasties and Song dynasties continued this. During the Yuan dynasty, it belonged to the Western Fan Changhexi Pacification Commission. In the fifth year of the Yongle reign of the Ming dynasty, the chieftain Awang Jiantai was awarded the title of Mingzheng Zhang for accompanying the expedition, governing the Yutong and Kongyu chieftaincies, and also serving as the Ningyuan Military and Civilian Pacification Envoy, a hereditary position. In the 39th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing dynasty, the chieftain Xila Zhakeba was killed by Tibetan officials Changce Jilie and others. The governor of Sichuan sent troops to put down the rebellion, and his son Shen Qin Tiande succeeded him. Later, it was changed to Dajianlu Associate Magistrate's Hall, subordinate to Yazhou Prefecture. Among the various chieftaincies under its jurisdiction, Mingzheng was the most respected. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign, Feng Quan, the Qing Dynasty's Assistant Minister stationed in Tibet, was killed by Tibetan mobs in Batang due to his arrogance and self-will. The Qing court appointed Yue Erfeng as the Border Affairs Minister, leading troops to quell the rebellion. After a year of conquest, in the 34th year of Guangxu, Dajianlu was changed to a Directly Subordinate Hall, under the jurisdiction of the Jianchang Dao, which governed the Six Grain Roads outside the pass. In the third year of the Xuantong reign, the land of the three chieftaincies was changed from hereditary to appointed magistrates. In the first year of the Republic of China, Yin Changheng led troops on a western expedition and changed Dajianlu to Kangding Prefecture. A Pacification Prefecture was established in the prefectural city, and various departments were established with himself as the Pacification Envoy, commanding the various armies and governing the various counties. In the second year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Internal Affairs standardized the national administrative regions and changed it to Kangding County, incorporating Anliang County. On New Year's Day of this year, the establishment of Xikang Province was realized, and it was designated as the provincial capital. The provincial government is located here, and the county seat remains as before. A Kangding Municipal Committee has now been established.</p>
<p>An Important Town in Western Territory: Xikang is internally subordinate to Sichuan and Yunnan, externally bordering Tibet and the south connecting to Burma, and the north linking to Qinghai. Since ancient times, it has been a key area on the western border. In the late Qing dynasty, the Qing court, due to the precarious situation in Kang and Tibet, with strong neighbors eyeing it from the outside and border residents rebelling from within, specially appointed Zhao Erfeng as the Sichuan-Yunnan Border Affairs Minister to actively manage and prepare for the establishment of a province. Zhao, with sufficient support from the central government and assistance from neighboring provinces, handled the matter of changing from hereditary to appointed magistrates throughout the border area. Wherever the military power reached, the barbarians were subdued. Within a few years, more than thirty counties were established. At that time, he stationed his headquarters in Ba'an, believing that the climate was mild, the products were abundant, and the situation was strategically important, no less than a southern frontier barrier. He planned to establish it as the capital, and all planned provincial construction was centered on Ba'an. People from Sichuan Province and missionaries from Britain and France flocked to Ba'an. Ba'an already had the prototype of a provincial capital. Later, due to the Qing Dynasty's overthrow, the Tibetan barbarians took the opportunity to invade, and more than ten counties in western Kang fell one after another. The people in charge of border affairs were repeatedly changed, perfunctorily and permissively, and the situation deteriorated. Gradually, the border situation worsened. After the Liu Wenhui unit of the 24th Army took over the defense, they used military force to recover Dengke, Dege, Baiyu, and Shiqu, completing the rule east of the Jinsha River. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the enemy has invaded deeper, and the territory has shrunk daily. Xikang is not only a barrier to the southwest national defense but also related to the future center of international transportation. Kangding has always been a transportation hub between Sichuan and Tibet and is now the capital of Xikang Province. The military and political affairs are both strategically important, thus forming an important town in the western territory.</p>
<p>A Tour of the Mountain City: Kangding is located on a plateau more than eight thousand seven hundred feet above sea level, situated among the surrounding mountains of Mount Paoma, Mount Guoda, and Mount Zierpo. The peaks are towering, and the high places are covered with snow all year round. The city is in a mountain valley, with the Zheduo River running through it. Han and Tibetan people live together, building houses with stacked stones, and forming markets along the river. Goods from Sichuan, Tibet, and central Kang are mostly concentrated here, with tea, medicinal materials, and furs being the main items of trade. In previous years, the climate in the urban area was extremely cold. In winter, the eaves of the houses had icicles hanging down, like glass railings. Every morning, merchants would get up early to break these ice railings before displaying their goods for business. This year, since the establishment of the provincial government, the population has increased sharply, and the climate has changed, not as strangely cold as in previous years. However, because it is surrounded by mountains, the air is not harmonious, and every afternoon, a storm arises. If it blows head-on, not only is breathing suffocated, but even cattle and sheep are often knocked over. On the day of the abolished lunar New Year's Day, this reporter made a city tour to peek into the barbaric customs of this border area. Descending from Mount Zierpo, entering Zhongzheng Street, at the time, the snow had just cleared, and the spring cold was biting. The white snow on the mountain dazzled the eyes. Looking up at the peak of Mount Haizi (there is a lake on the top of the mountain, which is rarely visited by people due to the high altitude), the snow and mist were hazy, and the clouds were indistinguishable. The harsh caw of the crow stirred the thoughts of the border. Arriving at the market street, seeing the shops on both sides, covered with Spring Festival couplets, all closed, because the people adhere to the old customs, and the lunar calendar is still difficult to abolish. That day (the 19th) happened to be the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. Various agencies, legal entities, schools, and shops hung the national flag to celebrate. Residents, whether Han or Tibetan, men and women, mostly wore new clothes, and greeted each other for the New Year. Turning east, crossing the Middle Bridge, to Zhongshan Street, along the way seeing Tibetan men, wearing newly made large fur robes, with sleeves almost touching the ground, tied with large belts, hitting money purses, wearing fur hats, wearing long cylinder boots, coming and going to celebrate the New Year. Turning west from Zhongshan Road, crossing the Upper Bridge, turning to Laoshan Street, walking to the front of the Gospel Church, seeing many Tibetan women, newly dressed, wearing large robes, wearing wide belts around their waists, braids crisscrossed on their heads, tied with red ropes, long earrings hanging from their ears, inlaid with ornaments, keys hanging from their waists, because it was the abolished lunar New Year, their faces were painted with powder, vying for beauty, showing off to each other. From time to time, there were people throwing dice to gamble on the street, with gongs and drums, occasionally interspersed with the sound of firecrackers, and there were people playing the huqin and singing Peking opera. Arriving at Beiguan, it gradually became desolate. Entering Zhongzheng Park, the eyes were full of desolation, nothing to see. Returning west, entering the General Temple, going straight to the main hall, the incense in front of the statues of gods was lingering, making it difficult to open the eyes. Seeing a young woman kneeling in front of the gods to draw lots. In a small room on the east side, an old monk was sitting cross-legged, beating drums and cymbals, chanting scriptures. Among them were Han and Tibetan children, playing with money. Under the porch of the temple gate, there were several male beggars begging here. The Spring Festival couplets posted on the door were all in Tibetan. After visiting, turning from Zhuge Street, climbing Mount Zierpo and returning. Just as I arrived at my residence, the wind and snow filled the sky again (to be continued).</p>

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Since the Hangzhou puppet municipal government canceled the department store tax, there has been no revenue, so that all the puppet officials, large and small, are in arrears of salary, and several disputes have occurred as a result. Recently, the puppet mayor, in order to increase revenue again, also drafted the Land Price Tax Law, the method of which generally follows the rules set by the former municipal government, but the tax standards are higher than before, with each mu taxed at a rate of ten per thousand of the land price, and has been approved by the puppet provincial government, will be implemented next month. And the new harsh taxes that have recently been implemented include the so-called maintenance fee (also known as the Baojia expense), which is divided into four grades of A, B, C, and D, and collected monthly from each household by the puppet police station, and there is also a grain export tax, where all grain transported for sale must be obtained from the puppet municipal government before a certificate is obtained, and the license fee is one corner per stone.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Plans Distribution</p>
<h3 id="e44">Righteous Teaching, Civil Teaching, Production Education Costs, Three Items Totaling Five Million Nine Hundred and Fifty Thousand Yuan <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Special Dispatch) In the 24th year, the Central Government, in order to vigorously implement compulsory education, allocated 2.4 million yuan to subsidize the righteous education expenses of various provinces and cities. Although the righteous education expenses continued to increase from the 25th year, no special expenditure was established for production education. This decision was made by the Executive Yuan on March 22nd, approving the report from the Ministry of Finance and Education, reviewing the request from Cheng Shiwei, Director of the Jiangxi Education Department, and others to increase the righteous education, civil education, and production education expenses for the 28th year. Special attention was given to production education, and an additional 800,000 yuan was allocated, which is indeed an important policy to adapt to wartime education. It was learned that there are four measures for resolving this case on the same day: (1) Calculate and fully increase according to the number listed in the 28th annual construction special fund budget, totaling 4.3 million yuan for compulsory education expenses, 1.81 million yuan for mass education expenses, and 800,000 yuan for production education expenses. (2) The aforementioned righteous education and mass education expenses should focus on production education. (3) The distribution and implementation plans for the various expenses listed in the first item should be drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval separately. (4) The subsidies received by each province and city for the aforementioned expenses shall not be used for other purposes. It is heard that the Ministry of Education is carrying out the allocation of funds and implementation plans based on the past situation of various provinces and the current special needs (the province that received the most subsidies in the past had 220,000 yuan per year), and at the same time, it still intends to order various provinces to raise funds themselves to meet the requirements of the central government, provinces, cities, and localities to jointly promote the cause, in order to strive to promote the purpose of popularizing education.</p>

The powerful Wang Ziping's Qingyin Sword was as alive as a dragon, the sword light flickering, dazzling to the eyes. Yang Ji'e's Thirteen Taibao Fist was agile. Others, such as Li Yuwu's ancestral Hou Sword, Hao Shaoru's Tai Chi, Cai Guiqin's Meteor Hammer, and Wu Jianqiu's Nine-Section Whip, all reached the time of pure fire. Finally, Tian Yurong, the wrestling champion of the National Games, and Ding Jinhai and Zhang Shizheng, the winners of yesterday's competition, performed wrestling.

<p>The 9th CYMCA Public Exhibition Cup Table Tennis Tournament started last week at the CYMCA Table Tennis Room. The first day was singles, groups 1, 3, and 5. The results were: (1) YMCA Crookling beat CYMCA Sun Jialu 2-1, (3) YMCA Wham beat CYMCA Chen Linan 2-1, (5) CYMCA Jiang Jiadu beat YMCA You Shi 2-0. The second day was singles, groups 2, 4, and 6. The results were: (2) He Shuoqing beat YMCA F. Crookling 2-0, (4) YMCA Ge Bomen beat CYMCA Wang Binglin 2-0, (6) CYMCA Li Youzhen beat YMCA Stan Lei 2-0. (Previous reports mistakenly published Stan Lei's victory.) In the two days of singles, CYMCA and YMCA each won 3 groups, with equal wins and losses. The championship this time will be decided in the last three doubles matches starting at 6:00 PM tonight. The CYMCA selection committee decided to fight with the most elite lineup, forming three groups: "Zhu Kuan and Sun Daosheng," "Yan Peiqiu and Hua Fenggang," and "He Shuoqing and Sun Jialu." In addition, Jiang Jiadu, Cheng Zhenhua, and Li Youzhen were invited as reinforcements. The skills, experience, and reputation of any of the above three groups are more than enough to compete with the YMCA's first group. Therefore, the order of the three groups has been determined by each player giving way to each other. After drawing lots, (1) Yan and Hua, (2) He and Sun, (3) Zhu and Sun. If there are any changes in the lineup at that time, the three reinforcements, Cheng, Jiang, and Li, will also be able to win. The order tonight is as follows:</p>

<p>There are three YMCA volleyball matches tonight. The first match is between Women's 1 After-School and Fanla A. Fanla A has won all three matches and is very strong. The After-School lineup is also quite neat, but unfortunately, they were discouraged in the first battle against Youxing. If they try their best to compete at that time, they will definitely pose a threat to Fanla. The second match is between Group B1 Monala and St. Francis. Both teams have repeatedly lost battles and are nothing to watch. The third match is between Group A Fang Guang Jia and the Russian Army. The Russian Army was the champion of the previous session. They lost their first battle to Haiqing, but their strength is still strong. Fang Gang is afraid that it will be difficult to blunt their edge. The order for today is recorded below: After-School vs. Fanla A (Women's 2) 7:15</p>
<p>Monala vs. St. Francis (B1) 8:00 PM</p>

<p>The CYMCA Sports Department in Ba Xian Qiao and the Fudan Alumni Association will hold a charitable basketball game, starring the Fudan alumni and the CYMCA team. The entire competition consists of three matches. The first match will be held on the afternoon of this Friday (the 15th) at 8:00 PM in the CYMCA gymnasium. When the Fudan basketball team entertained the press earlier, Mr. Wang Sifang of the school's alumni association and Mr. Peng Sanmei, representing the CYMCA, immediately agreed on the spot and actively proceeded with it. Preparations have now been completed and a date has been set for the event. Tickets are one yuan, and all proceeds will be used for refugee relief. The CYMCA team has strong players such as Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Chen Xianglong, Kong Guangyi, Xu Jusheng, Jia Youliang, Liang Guoquan, Qu Xilin, and Dong Yangfeng. Almost all the Shanghai players have been recruited. In addition to the original Sun Huipei, Zhou Dayun, Chen Hechong, Zhang Jinxiang, Lu Dazhen, Chuan Xiangrui, Zheng Boyi, Song Qihou, Zhou Jun and others, the alumni team has recently acquired Cai Yanxiong, and its strength has become even stronger. When they compete at that time, there will be a fierce fight, and give the fans a full feeling. In addition to seeking a strong physique and studying basketball skills, the only obligation that sports athletes living on isolated islands should fulfill is to do more charity games and relieve refugees. This kind of unshakeable duty is often a pleasure for all the athletes and cannot be refused, and people on isolated islands can also take the opportunity to actively contribute. It is expected that there will be a sensation for a while. In addition, Jiang Yiping, an old classmate of Fudan, initiated the combination of Xi Yushu, Li Zulai, Wu Falai, Shen Kunnan, Zhang Weiran and others to form a Fudan Old Man team, willing to fight against the old man teams of other schools and participate in this charity game.</p>

<h3 id="e58">French Ambassador to China, Kosimo, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; After Inspecting the Honor Guard, He Went to the Embassy; Then He Went to the Catholic Church to Attend the Worship; The Meeting Between Ambassadors Klein and Cole Seems to Have No Political Meaning <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China, Kosimo, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 9:30 AM at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession after presenting his credentials in Chongqing, transferred to Hong Kong and took the gunship Dadwoo. The French Consul General in Shanghai and French business leaders all came to the port to welcome him. The ambassador and the military attache of the embassy disembarked the ship, with military music playing loudly. He then inspected the honor guard, and after a brief meeting with the welcoming staff, he went straight to the French Embassy in Shanghai on the Bund of the French Great Road to rest. Then, accompanied by the French Consul, he went to the Catholic Church on Catholic Church Street to attend the worship.</p>
<p>Mr. Klein's Earnest Statement</p>
<p>Mainland newspapers reported that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Klein, and British Ambassador to China, Sir Cole, exchanged views for two days and discussed issues of "common interest." However, before departing for Tokyo on Friday, Ambassador Klein reiterated that their talks had no political meaning. Given that Ambassador Klein's trip to China was the first time, his earnest statement can be believed on the surface. Historically, British diplomats appointed as ambassadors to Japan have taken the route through Shanghai and discussed the Eastern situation with the ambassador to China first. However, Ambassador Klein took the route through Canada for his inauguration without passing through Shanghai, so he was unable to meet with Ambassador Cole. Although Ambassador Klein's arrival in Shanghai coincided with Ambassador Cole's departure for Chongqing yesterday (the 8th),</p>
<p>Mediation of the War Cannot Be Believed</p>
<p>However, there are several reasons why rumors of British mediation in the Sino-Japanese War cannot be believed. Britain's policy on the Sino-Japanese War has been clearly announced repeatedly, that is, Britain will only consider it if one of the warring parties requests mediation. Recent events have clearly shown that neither side has made this request or even considered it. Yesterday, responsible parties in Shanghai claimed that the Chinese government's attitude towards Wang Jingwei's peace proposal was a clear expression of Chairman Chiang's policy of fighting to the end. At the same time, Britain's confidence in this attitude has been expressed through recent credit loans, and Japan is unlikely to suddenly ask Britain to mediate.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers' Fierce Anti-English Tone</p>
<p>In recent weeks, editorials in Japanese newspapers and Chinese newspapers controlled by the Japanese have had a fierce anti-English tone, clearly reflecting the views of the Japanese government. Therefore, the general public believes that if Japan asks another country to mediate, Britain must be the last country chosen to undertake this task. It is believed that Sir Klein has obtained direct information on some long-pending disputes between Britain and Japan caused by the Japanese invasion of China, the main ones being the armed seizure of railways and the blockade of trade routes such as the Yangtze River. At the same time, outside speculation about Ambassador Cole's trip to Chongqing was also refuted by responsible parties. It is said that since the credit loan was agreed upon, the British ambassador has had no chance to meet with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Japanese Speculation is the Opposite</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily News speculated in the opposite direction from the opinions of the responsible British, saying that because Sir Klein and Ambassador Cole have fundamental differences in opinion, their Shanghai talks seemed to have failed. The newspaper also expressed its view as the reason for this decision to hold talks, that Britain believes that promoting peace in China is in its own interest, because it can maintain its position in Europe and protect its interests in China. The results of the talks have been reported to the British government, so what kind of changes will the British foreign policy make in the future? It is very noteworthy. The newspaper also reprinted the conversation when the Japanese authorities hosted Sir Klein at a banquet on Friday, saying that Mr. Morishima, the counselor of the Japanese embassy, ​​said, we have frankly exchanged views on the situation of the China Incident.</p>
<p>The Talks Seem to Have No Political Meaning</p>
<p>As for the talks between Sir Klein and Ambassador Cole, they seem to have no political meaning. Although we don't know what they talked about, we believe that any talks between the two ambassadors will change the British foreign policy. This time will also be the case.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Ships Detained at Songkou Have Not Yet Been Released; The Ship's Food Supply Is About to Run Out; The Portuguese Consul Visited the Japanese Consul Twice Without Success; Each Ship Is Forced to Fly the Japanese Flag; Passengers Were Safe Until Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Nine Portuguese ships, including Hailong Meda, were detained by Japanese warships on the sea surface of Dinghai, and after being forced to sail to Songkou to anchor, they have not been released until 6:00 PM yesterday. Tanglu Wheel telegraphed that food was about to run out and panic was starting. The Portuguese Consul thought the situation was serious, and although yesterday was a regular holiday, the office was still open as usual. The Portuguese Consul visited the Japanese Consul twice without success. Negotiations will continue today. Huamei Company, an American company, has telegraphed its general manager, Mr. Honto, stationed in Hong Kong, to report that except for Portuguese merchant ships, which are temporarily suspended, other German and Italian merchant ships continue to operate and maintain shipping. The following is a report from a modern news reporter on the situation:</p>
<p>The Detained Ships Remain at Songkou</p>
<p>The Portuguese Atlantic Hailong, Zhengde Libao, Meili Meda, and Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, and Tang Lu, which are represented by the American Huamei Company, as well as diesel-powered clapboard ships Baode and Mime, were detained and inspected by Japanese warships on the sea surface of Dinghai on the 6th and 7th of this month, respectively, while en route from Shanghai to Wenzhou. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, under the supervision of Japanese warships, they were forced to sail to Tongsha waters outside Songkou to anchor. The Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai reported to the Japanese side and made oral representations, but the Japanese Consul excused himself by saying that he had not received a report, so there was no result. Yesterday, the detained ships were still anchored in Tongsha waters and were being monitored by Japanese warships. Until 6:00 PM, there was no news of their release.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Consul Visited the Japanese Consul Twice Without Success</p>
<p>Since receiving the reports from the ship companies, the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai believed that the matter concerned the interests of Portuguese merchants and the safety of crew members and passengers, so although yesterday was a regular holiday, the consulate still opened as usual. The Portuguese Consul General visited the Japanese Consulate at around 11:00 AM yesterday to see Consul General Miura, but he was unable to meet him due to the Sunday holiday. He agreed with the staff of the consulate to visit again at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, hoping to notify the Japanese Consul to wait for the meeting. However, when he visited again in the afternoon, he was still unable to meet him, so he decided to continue to make strong representations to the Japanese Consulate today, demanding the immediate release of the detained ships, so as to protect the rule of law and maintain the national system.</p>
<p>Tanglu Telegraphed that There Was a Food Panic</p>
<p>The American Huamei Company in this city received a telegram from the owner of the Tanglu ship yesterday morning, saying that the food on board was about to run out and panic was about to start, and asking for prompt assistance, etc. The company immediately reported to the Portuguese Consul for negotiations. The crew of the detained ships, including the shipowners, chief mates, old sailors, cooks, stokers, and tea boys, totaled 600 people. The number of passengers totaled between 1,500 and 2,000 on each ship. Although the Taiping grain loaded on each ship, such as Tangbei, Tangqiao, Meda, and Hailong, was still abundant, because they had been detained for three days, there was a risk of running out of food. Moreover, one of the ships, Libao, sailed from Ningbo on the afternoon of the 5th when Zhenhai was declared closed, and it has been four days since yesterday. There were more than 300 passengers on board, so the food problem will be more serious than on other ships, which is generally worried about. However, it is known that as of yesterday afternoon, all the crew members and passengers were still quite well.</p>
<p>American Merchants Sent an Urgent Telegram to General Manager Honto</p>
<p>It is learned that Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, and Tang Lu, three of the detained Portuguese ships, are leased and represented by the American Huamei Shipping Company at No. 333 Simalu Road. Since the detention incident occurred, the Portuguese shipowners reported to the Portuguese Consul and asked for negotiations. However, the company's general manager, Mr. Honto, happened to go to Hong Kong for business, so there was no way to ask for instructions. Now, the company believes that the situation is serious and urgently telegraphed Hong Kong yesterday to report the situation to Mr. Honto and ask for instructions on how to deal with it, and telegraphed the US Consul General in Shanghai to make representations, and hoped that he would return to Shanghai on the same day to preside over the matter.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Wenzhou Route Operates as Usual</p>
<p>Although Portuguese ships such as Hailong and Meda operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route were illegally detained by Japanese warships, shipping companies from Germany and Italy still sent ships to operate as usual in order to maintain the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping. The Moufu ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm and the Deping ship of the Italian Zhongyi Company arrived in Wenzhou the night before last, and were scheduled to load cargo today and return to Shanghai. The Seli ship of the Italian Huayi Foreign Firm and the Feikang ship of the German Lulin Foreign Firm both telegraphed that they would sail to Shanghai one after another yesterday afternoon. The Haifa ship of the German Lihe Foreign Firm sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou at 4:00 AM yesterday. The Hana ship of the Yuanjian Company will also sail as soon as the ship is tidied up. As for Portuguese Tang Sai, Meifa, and Shantay, etc., because the detention incident has not been resolved and the truth is unknown, it has been decided to postpone the sailing temporarily.</p>
<p>Forcing the Japanese Flag to Be Hung Is Safe for Passengers</p>
<p>The shipowner of Meda of the Portuguese Meili Company sent a wireless message from the ship yesterday, reporting to the company and the Portuguese Consul, saying: "Since last night (ie the night before last), we have been forced to change to flying the Japanese flag, and the crew and passengers are safe and sound. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with a foreign ship passenger who arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The detained Portuguese merchant ships are now all anchored outside Wusongkou, but the Japanese flag has been hung on the mast, and the Portuguese merchant ship flag is still hanging. There are Japanese warships parked nearby, which seem to be monitoring the detained Portuguese ships.</p>
<p>Libao Imported Under Surveillance</p>
<p>After being detained on the sea surface of Zhejiang, the Portuguese Zhengde Company's Libao ship operating on the Ningbo-Dinghai route has been driven into Wusongkou yesterday and anchored at the No. 18 pontoon in Yangshupu, where the previously detained Livorno ship is parked. The other detained ships are still outside Wusongkou. There are a total of four Japanese warships monitoring them. It is said that Libao's import was ordered by the Japanese Navy, but the ship's actions are still being monitored. The ship carried 300 passengers from Ningbo to Dinghai, who were forced to stay on the ship.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily News, information obtained from British military sources last night (the 8th) indicates that the British garrison in Shanghai will soon be reduced to only one large battalion.

<h3 id="e62">Japanese Consulate Notification of Invading Zhejiang Unconfirmed - Tranquility Prevails Throughout Eastern Zhejiang - Huang Shao-hong Optimistic About the War Situation - Chinese Troops Fully Defending Both Banks of the Grand Canal <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's report that the Japanese Consul had notified consuls from Germany, Italy, and other countries about an impending invasion of Eastern Zhejiang has been confirmed to be completely inaccurate. However, the Japanese side did notify the German and Italian consuls that, in order to protect the property of German and Italian nationals living along the Chinese coast, the two consuls should report on property along the Chinese coast, without specifying any coastal locations. Reporters from the New Voice News Agency also learned from shipping circles yesterday that, while Zhenhai in Eastern Zhejiang has restricted ships from entering and leaving, the gap in the blockade line has not yet been closed by the old Taiping steamer. The authorities have decided not to sink the ship unless absolutely necessary. Defensive works have been built and heavy troops stationed along the coast and rivers of Eastern Zhejiang. It will not be easy for Japanese troops to invade Eastern Zhejiang. At the same time, telegrams from various locations in Eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Quzhou, all stated that tranquility prevails as usual, and that various rumors circulating are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Huang Shao-hong Discusses Eastern Zhejiang's Defense</p>
<p>Huang Shao-hong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has gone to the front lines of the defense area in Eastern Zhejiang to inspect and make detailed arrangements, waiting for an opportunity to launch a counterattack. It is reported that Mr. Huang recently told a foreign reporter that the military deployment in Eastern Zhejiang over the past year or more has created a strong resistance force in terms of defense. No matter where the Japanese troops come from, they will encounter huge sacrifices and waste their efforts. Large armies are stationed along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang and the south bank of the Qiantang River. The border between Zhejiang and Jiangxi is full of mountains and ridges. Once the war starts, it will not be able to end in a short amount of time. We should exhaust the last drop of blood and fight the enemy to the end. The people of Eastern Zhejiang have always been extremely fierce and warlike, a potential force that cannot be underestimated. If it breaks out in the future, the future is extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Control Grand Canal Transportation</p>
<p>The Grand Canal transportation within Jiangsu and Zhejiang is the only traffic route for connecting the voyage to North China. According to news from shipping circles, the Chinese troops on the eastern battlefield are now fully controlling it, so it is still impossible to use it today.

<p>Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the Postal Bureau has been ordered to organize a military postal service to meet the needs of the war of resistance. Those that have been successively established include Jin-Shaanxi, Western Henan, E-Wan, Southern Jiangxi, Eastern Zhejiang, Hunan, and other places, to handle military communications with remarkable results. Now, because the second phase of the war of resistance has begun, a special military postal general inspection office has been set up in Guangdong and Guangxi, stipulating that all military mail shall be sent, distributed, and transferred according to expedited mail procedures. Officers and soldiers of the troops may purchase free money orders from post offices handling military mail for remittances of up to twenty yuan. However, the procedure for purchasing free money orders must be handled by military mail messengers designated by the troops to ensure confidentiality and convenience. In addition, regulations for military postal communication and savings have been established to solve the savings problems of soldiers on the battlefield.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the French postal ship "Général Joffre," which recently collided with the British steamer "Guangzhou" near Hong Kong, will sail to Shanghai on May 8th. Although the ship sailed into Hong Kong on its own after the collision, it was severely damaged and is now under repair in Hong Kong. Its arrival in Shanghai is to replace the "Félix Roussel," which sailed from Marseille and recently arrived in Saigon, where it is said to be weeping over France. After the "Général Joffre" arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong on May 8th, it will sail to Marseille the next day.</p>

<p>British soldier Carter from the East Yorkshire Regiment stationed in Shanghai suddenly disappeared on the evening of last Thursday.

Carter is 21 years old. On Thursday of last week, he was still wearing a blue uniform, and his companions saw him. His sudden disappearance in the middle of the night is suspicious.</p>
<h3 id="e66">New Regulations on Transit and Residence Permits Promulgated by the Vietnamese Government - Visas and Passports Valid for Fifteen Days - Our Consul in Hanoi Requests Amendments <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>After the war, Vietnam became an important route for entering and exiting the Southwest. Various foreign shipping companies have increased the number of ships sailing on the Haiphong route. Two new regulations on transit and residence visas have now been promulgated by the local government in Vietnam:</p>
<p>(1) Those holding passports with transit visas issued by the French consulate can reside in Vietnam for 15 days. If the visa expires, they must pay an additional 7.5 Vietnamese currency in order to temporarily reside for 30 days from the date of arrival. Those residing for more than one month must pay head tax, otherwise</p>
<p>double penalty</p>
<p>(2) Those holding passports with entry visas issued by the French consulate will be regarded as immigrants and must go to the license tax bureau within 48 hours of arrival to complete the head tax payment procedure. Otherwise, they will be fined: males 30 yuan, females 3 yuan. Due to this regulation, recently</p>
<p>Chinese people going to Vietnam</p>
<p>Those holding transit visa passports are more convenient than those holding entry visa passports, so as not to be fined for not reporting after 48 hours. If a person holding a transit visa intends to reside in Vietnam for more than 15 days, but not more than one month, he may request the French consulate where he is located to issue an entry visa, but at the same time, it must be noted "non-resident," so as not to be treated as an immigrant by the local government.</p>
<p>treatment. The visa office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Hong Kong has forwarded a notice to those who obtained passports there to apply for a transit visa from the French consulate. If the passport holder resides in Haiphong, he can also apply for a transit visa after arriving there, so as to avoid the restrictions on immigrants and reduce the risk of punishment. At the same time, the consul of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Hanoi requested the Governor of Vietnam to amend the above regulations.</p>

<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Siamese government has not only increased the amount of entry tax and restricted Chinese people from going there, but also promulgated various harsh regulations in the country, making it impossible for our overseas Chinese to live in peace in business. For example, trade, education, residence, etc. are often interfered with. As a result, overseas Chinese from Fujian, Guangdong, and other places in Siam have been packing up and returning to China due to unbearable oppression. Ships from Siam to Hong Kong and Guangdong are carrying these overseas Chinese. The Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce has reported the inability of overseas Chinese in Siam to live and work in peace and various harsh treatments to the government for verification. Now the government, in addition to ordering local authorities to properly settle the returning overseas Chinese, will also conduct strict negotiations to correct this situation of damaging friendly relations with the Siamese government.</p>

<p>Since Wang Jingwei's traitorous behavior was exposed, the people of the whole country have been unanimously outraged and have sent telegrams to the Central Government requesting arrest and legal punishment. The dock workers' union in this city also telegraphed yesterday requesting arrest and punishment. The original text reads, "To the esteemed Chiang Kai-shek, Director-General of the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing, Chen Li-fu, Minister of Social Affairs, and all members of the committee: Before Zhao Ming lightly uttered absurd remarks, the Central Government was lenient and did not pursue the matter. Recently, he has become even more intense, betraying the Party and the country, selling out the nation, and leading the enemy to attack China. Divine and human wrath is aroused, and heaven and earth are intolerant. All workers in this union are clenching their fists, gnashing their teeth, and vowing not to coexist with him.

<h3 id="e69">Four Warehouses of an American Company - Japanese and Puppets Attempt to Occupy - William Hunt &amp; Company Decides to Negotiate According to Law <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>After the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sold all of its real estate to the American William Hunt &amp; Company before the war, except for the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession, which was converted into the Roosevelt Wharf, there were also four locations, including the Pudong New Warehouse, China Warehouse, Hongkou Central Warehouse, and North Warehouse. After the war, they were occupied by the Japanese army. After repeated negotiations, they have not been returned to the company. Recently, the Japanese military authorities withdrew their troops from the Pudong New and China Warehouses and handed them over to the Japanese Nisshin Company for management, hoping to reorganize and resume business. The Hongkou Central and North Warehouses are still storing military ammunition and supplies, and are under military management. The puppet "Reform Government" recently disregarded the American company's property rights and attempted to seize all the property of these four warehouses and wharves from the Japanese. The Japanese Nisshin Company refused to allow the puppet government to interfere, leading to a conflict of interest between the Japanese and puppets. Before this dispute is resolved, the Pudong New and China Warehouses occupied by the Nisshin Company have also temporarily suspended reorganization and only sent a few employees to guard them, without any activity. It is reported that William Hunt &amp; Company believes that this legal sale between China and the United States has been legally confirmed by the American Consular Court and will again rely on international law to request the American embassy and consulates to negotiate with the Japanese side and set a date to recover the property rights of the four warehouses.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Suzhou Puppet Government Celebrates Anniversary - Suddenly Attacked by Chinese Troops - Burning Down Arches and Firing Warning Shots - Chinese Troops Capture Xiaotang Village, Shejiahang <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>According to visitors from Suzhou, the puppet "county government" and various puppets in Suzhou held a "celebration" on the 28th of last month for the "anniversary of the establishment of the puppet 'Reform Government'." They built arches at the intersection of Chayuanchang and Guanqian Street. The cost of the arches, decorated with hundreds of electric torches, was forcibly borne by the people by the puppet organizations, which also forced ignorant residents to participate. Japanese troops and puppet police were responsible for security. Captain Liu of the independent brigade of a certain army stationed in a certain place heard the news and immediately sent many plainclothes team members to infiltrate the urban area. Taking the opportunity, they set fire to the arches and fired several warning shots. The order was disrupted for a time, and the puppet police looked at each other in dismay. After completing their mission, the team members left quietly in the chaos. The general public applauded and cheered.</p>
<p>Attacking Cars - Recently, the Central Military Authorities have equipped various war zones and launched a general counter-offensive. In order to cooperate with the military operations in the front and contain the Japanese troops in the rear, the Chinese troops in various guerrilla zones are also active everywhere, targeting railways and highways at important transportation hubs. According to a person from Kunshan, who spoke to the Modern News Agency yesterday, two Japanese Daizhi cars, fully loaded with gauze, driving from Shanghai to Qingpu, Kunshan, and Suzhou, were ambushed by more than 40 Chinese troops lying in ambush near Kunshan on the 8th of last month. The Chinese troops jumped out from both sides of the highway and ordered them to stop. Seeing that the situation was not good, the drivers tried to escape at full speed, but were shot by the Chinese troops with machine guns. The car bodies were riddled with holes. The Japanese guards could not resist and were captured. All the cargo, except for the portable ones, was taken away. The cloth and other items in their original boxes were too bulky to be carried away easily, so they were all burned.</p>
<p>Recapturing Xiaotang - The Nakajima unit of the Japanese army, which had been entrenched in Xiaotang, Fengxian County, was besieged by the guerrillas led by Ding Xueshan for days. The fighting was fierce, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The remaining enemy could not hold out and suddenly broke through and retreated last night (the 8th). The Japanese army suffered heavy losses after several days of siege. The town was recaptured by the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Puppet Army Suffers a Miserable Defeat - In the Fengnanchuan area of Pudong, the puppet troops of Zhang Miaogen and Xu Hongfa have been harassing more and more intensely. The Chinese guerrillas were ordered to suppress them and have repeatedly won victories. The Chinese troops on the evening of the 8th were the Second Company Commander Chen Musen and the Guard Battalion Commander Wu Ding and other subordinates of Commander Chen Yi of the Sixth Detachment of the Fifth Column of the Jiangzhe Border Guerrilla. The puppet troops were all mixed teams. The Chinese troops advanced from Yujiaqiao on the evening of the same day and engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet troops there for three hours. The gunfire was very intense. Later, the puppet troops suffered more than half casualties and fought to Zhoupu for help. The Chinese troops, having achieved their mission, retreated safely that night.</p>
<p>Capture of Dujiahang - According to a person from Pudong, the Third Regiment of Infantry of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Force recently arrived in Pudong from a certain place, with a total of about 5,000 troops, with strong equipment and strict military appearance. The vanguard has reached a certain place and has exchanged fire with the Japanese army more than a dozen times. It is now heard that the army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Dujiahang Town, Pudong at about 5 pm on the 7th of last month. The Chinese troops were personally commanded by Regiment Commander Xu Xingzhou and Regiment Adjutant Tao Xisheng. The fighting lasted for two hours. The Japanese army could not hold out and withdrew. The town was captured by the Chinese troops. In this battle, more than 30 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and the Chinese troops captured four machine guns. The Chinese troops suffered only five injuries and three boatmen.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily News, American Anderson chartered a Ningbo sailing ship from Mo Tiemou of the China-America Bookstore Company, named it "American Legion," and set off on Friday with his wife, two foreigners, and three Chinese boatmen, intending to sail directly to San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean, which would take about 70 days. They had originally planned to set sail on Thursday, but the departure was delayed due to the issuance of a quarantine certificate and only took place the next day. The US State Department has recently ordered the US Consulate General in this city not to allow Americans to charter sailing ships, but Mr. Anderson chartered the "American Legion" two days before receiving the instruction in Shanghai, so the ship is the last sailing ship flying the American flag to set sail from Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Heard That Mr. Wen Lanting Stated That the Exchange Has Not Been Ordered to Resume Business, and Resumption of Business in the Special Circumstances of Shanghai is Factually Prohibited <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities, Cloth, Flour, Grain, Gold, and other five exchanges stopped opening auctions after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. Although the exchange authorities have been preparing to resume, they have always been prohibited by the environment in the special circumstances. The current dark markets for securities and grains have nothing to do with the exchange authorities. They are dark market transactions by brokers and are limited to spot goods only, without futures. Previously, someone attempted to establish a joint exchange in the name of a foreign company, but was investigated and banned by orders from the Ministries of Finance and Economy, which led to the suspension of preparations. Today's report that each exchange was ordered by the Ministry to prepare for resumption, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited each exchange director yesterday. (1) According to Wen Lanting, director of the Cloth Exchange, the office did not receive an order from the Ministry to prepare for resumption. According to the current situation in Shanghai, resumption is factually impossible. (2) According to Chen Zi, director of the Grain Exchange, the office did not receive an order from the Ministry to prepare for resumption. Moreover, the office held a board meeting a few days ago and planned to rent out the office. (3) According to news from the Flour Exchange, the location of the office has been designated as a refugee area in Nanshi. The board of directors has not made any preparations for resumption. The Securities Exchange has denied the claim that it is preparing to resume and restore the formal seven-shot auctions. According to the above, it confirms that the claim that the exchanges were ordered to resume opening auctions is absolutely inaccurate. According to Xin Xin News Agency, in the current environment in Shanghai, even if the exchanges hope to resume business, it is factually impossible. For example, cotton yarn has been controlled by the Japanese and puppets. If the exchange resumes business and opens futures trading, what will be used to deliver the goods if obstruction is encountered at that time? Resuming business is no different from being used by others. For example, in securities trading, if it is stipulated that the market price must not be lower than 70%, it will inevitably lead to a dumping trend when compared with the current dark market price, which will cause social and financial instability. Therefore, it is factually absolutely impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Zhejiang Mail Forwarded from Wenzhou - Parcels Above Jinhua Suspended <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration previously stipulated that all mail from Shanghai to counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shao, Yuyao, Ningbo, and cities and counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, such as Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Jinhua, and Nanchang, whether registered, express, or regular mail, would be forwarded from Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Haimen. Now that shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been interrupted and traffic is obstructed, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the transportation section of the bureau yesterday that all mail to counties in eastern Zhejiang will be forwarded from Wenzhou (Yongjia) in the future. Therefore, the delivery time may be extended due to the concentration of mail in one place. It is also heard that Xuan'an, Guaitou, Pingyang, Lishui, Lanxi, Yin County, Haimen, and other places are also forwarded from Wenzhou. As for various parcels in eastern Zhejiang, the large parcels were completely suspended before, but now Wenzhou has already resumed, and other small parcels are still accessible. However, all counties and cities above Jinhua have successively suspended both large and small parcels due to traffic congestion. Below Jinhua, the limit is only 5 kilograms.</p>
<p>Shanghai and Southwest Mail - According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Post Office learned that Shanghai's mail to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and various places in Xiang and Guangxi can still reach Dongxiang on the eastern section due to the loss of Nanchang. Above Dongxiang, although there is a highway that can detour to Ji'an, cross Nanchang, and connect with the western section of Zhangshu, there are many obstacles due to military relations, demolition of road rails, and congestion of highway and military transportation.</p>
<p>Postal Route Adopted - The Postal Bureau has changed its mail delivery to the Southwest to Shantou, via Qujiang, and to Hengyang, so mail delivery between Shanghai and the Southwest is still smooth. However, it is still limited to light items only, and it is difficult to restore parcels and heavy items for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Exploring the Pros and Cons of Celibacy and Sexual Moderation from a Health Perspective <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Currently, among scholars discussing the issue of celibacy and sexual moderation, there are approximately two factions: one faction believes that good health never relies on sexual activity as a condition. There are many disputes and no consensus. The purpose of sexual desire is for reproduction, for reproductive rather than physiological action, which is recognized by everyone. Ejaculation is also specifically for the purpose of conception and is by no means for entertainment between men and women. If people can preserve essence and protect yang, and not let it leak out, then the several types of excitatory and active secretions contained in the essence can be transformed into the body's needs. If ejaculation is not for the purpose of conception, it is simply depleting oneself and destroying oneself. If you look at major athletes or speakers, they must abstain from sexual activity when holding major sports or speeches, and live a simple life in order to obtain the greatest efficiency in terms of physical and intellectual strength. Therefore, the latter's claim is recognized by more people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the impact of sexual desire on our daily lives, there are two major issues that must be studied: (1) Is sexual desire necessary for physiology? The general view is that sexual desire is as indispensable to life as hunger for food and sleepiness for sleep, which is a big mistake. Sexual desire is only active in a certain period of life; before and after this, there is no activity of sexual desire, but it does not hinder the individual's health. (2) Does sexual desire vary from person to person? Eating and sleeping are the instincts of a newborn. However, it is not the same for people's sexuality. For example, there are people who lack emotion. They have no love for the opposite sex, so they have no need for sexual intercourse. There are also so-called romantic youths, who are either born with it or indulged in nature, burning in the fire of lust and acting recklessly. Furthermore, what A sees as sexual beauty may not be strange to B and may be hateful to C. If we look at the different sexual desires of each person, it is clear that sexual desire is not a need of the body.</p>
<p>Since sexual desire is not as indispensable to daily life as appetite, in order to maintain physical and mental health, we should not indulge in lust. However, since we know that sexual desire is necessary for our reproduction, we should quickly cure the problems caused by indulgence, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, and irregular menstruation. According to this doctor's experience, the treatment for the above symptoms is to increase essence and tonify the kidneys. For example, the German Xiongzhuang animal pill essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang," not only produces essence and tonifies the kidneys, but also calms the nerves and prevents excitement. Long-term use has the effect of reversing aging. Therefore, many stubborn premature ejaculation, impotence, and underdevelopment have been effectively treated with continuous use.

<p>— Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Young people should be healthy, happy, and pure, which is what everyone wants. However, during the development period, there are many people who are influenced by bad environments or induced by obscene reading materials to develop the so-called bad habit of masturbation.</p>
<p>In terms of the impact of masturbation on health, it is already difficult to estimate. What's more, it leads to the subsequent degradation of personality and moral decline. People who have masturbated for too long often have dull eyes, dark circles around their eyes, cold hands, and staggering steps. They suffer from nocturnal emission every day, toss and turn in bed and cannot sleep, and yawn frequently in the morning. At this point, it can be said that they have reached a worrying stage.</p>
<p>Masturbation and nocturnal emission are inseparable symptoms. After masturbation damages the essence gate, the essence gate loses its control and becomes hypersensitive. A slight stimulation will cause leakage. Over time, neurasthenia, kidney deficiency, underdevelopment, and other symptoms will occur. The treatment should be strictly maintained, abstain from masturbation, and take German-made "Nice Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop it. If you supplement it with the German male "Buti Kang," a puberty gland tonic, it will be easier to restore health.</p>

<h3 id="e82">How to Have Confidence in Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>The treatment of ever-changing gonorrhea lies in having a central grasp, so that you can deal with it with ease. But how to have confidence in treating gonorrhea? This question has now been resolved. Because countries around the world are now frantically researching methods to eliminate gonorrhea, as a result, the German master of gonorrhea, Dr. Peter, invented the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinnong," which is used by doctors in various countries around the world. The following is a summary of the clinical experiments of gonorrhea experts from various countries around the world:</p>
<p>Dr. Liverpool from the United States said: One evening, a patient with acute gonorrhea came, whose pain was very severe, with pus and blood flowing, and his spirit was greatly hit. When asked if he had been treated for this disease? He replied that he had taken sandalwood oil and chemical therapy drugs on the market, but he still could not get a fundamental solution after taking them. I used various scientific methods to check and found that the gonorrhea had reversed into the posterior urethra, so the inflammation of the posterior urethra was very fierce and terrifying. I told him to stop these bad treatments and change to using the "Kelinnong" invented by Dr. Peter from Germany. After a week, all the inflammation completely subsided, and it was completely cured after eight days. The doctor once said to the patient that inferior drugs on the market are actually harmful and not beneficial to gonorrhea. Taking drugs recommended by doctors such as "Kelinnong" can cure gonorrhea fundamentally, quickly, and safely.</p>
<p>Dr. Adi Mai of Switzerland also has the most abundant experience with "Kelinnong." According to him, I once used the drug "Kelinnong" to cure an old gonorrhea patient who had suffered from it for six or seven years. The patient had traveled to various countries and major cities, and had been treated by countless famous doctors, but the condition was always difficult to solve fundamentally. I asked if I had the confidence to cure this disease fundamentally. I smiled and said that if you have the determination to cure gonorrhea, I can be fundamentally responsible for curing it. The patient followed my words. After examination and diagnosis, I found that he had developed gonococcal arthritis. I told him to take the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinnong" to make its anti-gonorrhea sterilization effect fill the joints and blood. As a result, this difficult gonorrhea was completely and fundamentally cured in five weeks, restoring his healthy body. "Kelinnong" is better than any chemical preparation.</p>

<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Feng Yongde, with a weak constitution. He suffered from hemoptysis at the age of twenty. He recovered after resting for several months. Later, due to excessive use of the brain, it occurred again last summer, with chest tightness and gasping. He coughed up blood phlegm. He had a slight fever of 37.7 degrees in the evening. His body became thinner and haggard. He had difficulty sleeping at night. He had many dreams and palpitations, and night sweats. He felt dizzy and mentally tired when he got up in the morning. After X-ray examination, there were small holes the size of silver corners in the lungs. Tuberculosis had reached the third stage. He was told to take the German "Bufei Naer" internally. After taking less than two bottles, the night sweats and fever were gone, and the condition improved greatly. So he continued to take it continuously for three weeks, and at the same time, he was asked to stay absolutely quiet at home and eat more nutritious foods. Coughing, gasping, hemoptysis, and other symptoms were completely cured, and his appetite increased greatly, and his weight increased. He changed into a beautiful and healthy man.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Standard Therapy for Arthritis <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Wandering like a bandit, gonorrhea has the nature of mercury, escaping and digging, it really is everywhere, and its whereabouts are erratic, and is similar to bandits, so the question is how to completely capture and eliminate gonorrhea. The achievement of such a goal cannot be achieved by general membrane-penetrating sterilization and ordinary chemical therapy, because these therapies only show a temporary effect on the surface, and cannot fundamentally eliminate gonorrhea deep in the tissue, because as long as there is a gonorrhea in our body, the effect of sterilization will inevitably be abandoned, so the focus of the current problem is how to eliminate gonorrhea in one fell swoop, so as to achieve a fundamental cure. It seems that general local therapy for arthritis, which is most widely found in latent bacteria, is almost absolutely impossible to succeed, such as membrane-penetrating sterilization, chemical therapy, etc.</p>
<p>Anti-gonorrhea therapy Due to the above reasons, a new anti-gonorrhea therapy has to be used to radically treat gonococcal arthritis, and the only oral medicine that can competently and pleasantly surprise the world is "Kelinnong." With 20 years of experience, every new drug that comes out every year has been tested almost all over, and I have always trusted the drug "Kelinnong," because it has the effect of increasing self-preservation of gonorrhea, surrounding the lesions, and there is no disadvantage of missing a gonorrhea. I use German lymph消, and static electricity method. X-ray radiotherapy, and phase for use, only "Kelinnong" sterilization effect, , then it belongs to arthritis from and by, I always use these therapies, to radical cure, this can be called the standard gonorrhea method. From the date of record, 10,000,020. , period only , number gold 5 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Anle Textile Factory Purchases Japanese Yarn, Dispute Arises Over Delivery, Anle Factory Attempts to Deny Goods, Heng'an Yarn Company Wins Lawsuit <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Since August 13th, textile factories in this city have been purchasing Japanese yarn to make goods due to the shortage of domestic cotton yarn and soaring prices, and then claiming to be domestic goods because they are woven by Chinese merchant factories. This kind of impure and superficially domestic goods are now everywhere in the market, and almost all old cotton yarn businesses sell Eastern goods. However, in recent years, when both buyers and sellers encounter Eastern goods in transactions, they mostly use cash transactions as a principle, without leaving any traces between acceptance and delivery, so as to avoid criticism. Although this is</p>
<p>A strategy to prevent accusations</p>
<p>However, there are many disputes between buyers and sellers due to incomplete transaction procedures. For example, the case between Anle Textile Factory and Heng'an Yarn Company in Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, is an example of this kind of dispute. Anle started purchasing yarn from Heng'an last spring, and the transaction was very large. Every decision was made to pay in cash, and there were no disputes at first. Until June 27th and 30th, Anle ordered a total of 25 pieces of Hongxi brand, Dahong brand, and Lima brand 20s and 16s simple yarn. At the same time, they ordered 100 pieces of 20s futures yarn for July. After Heng'an delivered the 25 pieces of spot goods, Anle</p>
<p>One hundred pieces of futures yarn</p>
<p>At first, they asked for a cancellation, but seeing the yarn price soaring, they suddenly sent a letter urging delivery. Heng'an refused strictly because they were inconsistent. Anle, seeing that there was no way to take advantage, took advantage of the gap between the previous batch of spot transactions, and took the opportunity of not giving the delivery receipt for the goods, and re-ordered 25 pieces of tube yarn from Heng'an. Dai Ren'an, the manager of Heng'an, thought that Anle Textile Factory was a leader in the weaving industry in this city, so how could it come up with the idea of spending one batch of money to cut two batches of goods? After reasoning with Deng Zhonghe and Zhang Houqin, the factory owners, Deng and others insisted that Heng'an disregarded credit and</p>
<p>Attempted to deny goods</p>
<p>They then hired lawyer Song Qiwen to file a complaint against Heng'an Yarn Company and its manager Dai Ren'an in the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering the delivery of 15 pieces of 20s tube yarn and 10 pieces of 16s tube yarn purchased. Although the defendant asked its employee Shen Shende to appear in court during the trial to prove that the yarn had been delivered to the plaintiff's own car by him together with Xin Jing, Ri Xin (both Japanese merchants), Liang Yang Bank, and An Shen Yang Bank, because it was a cash transaction, there was no receipt for the goods. The staff of Xin Jing and other warehouses also testified to the</p>
<p>Fact of delivery</p>
<p>However, the judge in the first instance ultimately determined that the defendant could not provide strong evidence that the yarn had been delivered to the plaintiff, and that the statements of the witnesses were also very different, so the defendant's claims were difficult to believe. The judgment was that the defendant should deliver 15 pieces of 20s tube yarn and 10 pieces of 16s tube yarn to the plaintiff, and the litigation costs should be borne by the defendant. Heng'an refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Zhang Yiping to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, explaining the reasons for dissatisfaction. He said that the 25 pieces of Lima brand tube yarn purchased by Anle were all delivered on the day of payment, and there were detailed records in the ledger and other account books, which</p>
<p>Record Mingzhe</p>
<p>Could be used as proof. The original trial did not adopt this very important documentary evidence. At that time, the appellant requested the appellee to submit the purchase book, which could immediately reveal the truth. However, what they submitted was only a general ledger of raw materials to perfunctorily deal with the matter. They also listed the facts that the warehouse staff saw when the goods were shipped, and requested to summon them to testify. Finally, they requested that the original judgment be abolished and the appellee's first instance claim be rejected, and that the appellee be ordered to bear the litigation costs of both instances in order to show fairness. After the Second Branch of the Higher Court opened a collegial panel to summon both parties and witnesses for examination and inquiry, and concluded, it issued the main text of the judgment the day before yesterday, stating that the original judgment was abolished, the appellee's first instance claim was rejected, and the litigation costs of both instances were borne by the appellee.</p>

<p>Motorist Huang Asi, resident of No. 66 Huanlong Road, French Concession, was driving a No. 6852 self-provided car owned by Japanese Yokota at 7:40 pm on the first of this month, and was driving east on Fuxu Road, Shandong, at high speed, when a British woman, Mullte Gai (phonetic transcription, 36 years old), residing at No. 363 Fuxu Road, crossed Fuxu Road from north to south. Because she could not avoid it in time, she was hit and knocked to the ground. Motorist Huang Asi drove away quickly after the accident. A passerby, Jiang Dingyuan, Fang Jinming, caught a glimpse of the car's license plate number and reported it to the patrolmen, who reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate and summon Huang Asi. He admitted to causing the accident. The police station sent Huang to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. The lawyer of the French Concession administrative authority filed a lawsuit according to Article 64, Paragraph 2 of the Public Works Bureau Traffic Regulations. The victim also appeared in court to testify about the injuries she suffered in the collision. When Huang Asi was questioned, he still firmly denied it. The judge reviewed the confession and ordered a re-examination after further investigation.</p>

<p>According to the Mainland News, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Works Department, under the direction of the police department personnel, erected barbed wire fences around the Chinese residence at No. 428 Haig Road, bordering the Public Concession, starting in the morning (8th). It is rumored that the residence was once the residence of Li Guojie, and now someone intends to use it to open a large gambling den in the near future. Yesterday, the authorities did not admit this statement, but all circles other than the police department have confirmed that this is undoubtedly the reason for the police department's action. It is believed that the people currently residing in the residence are Japanese people, either Koreans or Taiwanese. When the patrolmen directed the erection of obstacles in front of the residence, several Koreans or Taiwanese sent women out of the cliff, while they themselves remained inside. It was learned yesterday that the barbed wire mesh was placed on the sidewalk outside the wall of the house along Haig Road. The police department had been preparing to erect it a few days ago. At that time, the Japanese authorities had consulted with the police authorities, but broke down. The police department then placed obstacles in the area under its jurisdiction. It was also heard that many Chinese workers who were now engaged in repairs in the house to make it suitable for the needs of the club were surrounded inside, leaving only one entrance and exit, which could lead to the Chinese boundary.</p>

In July of last year, his stepson, Guan Tong, who is 17 years old this year, privately opened the iron box and stole gold and jewelry hairpins, as well as checks and seals from the money house. He first sold the jewelry, opened a hotel, and summoned prostitutes for pleasure. Then his father went to the money house to withdraw more than 3,000 yuan in deposits. After the money was spent, he could not survive outside, so he sneaked back home in February. Hou reported it to the French police station, which sent detectives to arrest Guan Tong and send him to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. After Judge Qiu repeatedly held trials and announced the conclusion, he sentenced Hou Guotong to two years in prison for theft, suspended for two years, and acquitted him of the remaining parts.</p>

Court Orders Postponement Pending Testimony from Witnesses. <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Weng, a widow from Zhenze, formerly residing at Number 7, Liansheng Lane, Yuyuan Road, and her late husband, Zhou Junyu, served in the Public Security Bureau and tax authorities, accumulating hundreds of thousands of assets. Zhou's concubine, Xu Baozhen, and her son, Jiateng (twelve years old), and daughter, Baoshi (six years old), recently engaged lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District, accusing the first wife, Zhou Weng (fifty-one years old), and her son, Jiahua (twenty-four years old), of wrongfully occupying the estate. They requested the court to order the defendants to provide the plaintiffs with reasonable living expenses and to turn over the complete</p>
<p>Estate Account Books</p>
<p>for calculation, so that the plaintiffs can receive their shares, divided into four parts for the three plaintiffs. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned the parties for a hearing in the Second Civil Court yesterday, presided over by Guo Wei. The plaintiff, Zhou Xu Baozhen, stated that she was thirty-five years old, from Wujiang. In November of the tenth year of the Republic of China, she was introduced by Zhou Xutang and married Zhou Junyu as a concubine. After the marriage, they lived together in Zhenze (in the same house with the first wife) and had five children. Except for three who died young, there are still one son and one daughter (i.e., the second and third plaintiffs). In August of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, they</p>
<p>Moved to Suzhou</p>
<p>to Number 25, Wangxima Lane, to live in the house of lawyer Fan Chongguang. The husband paid for the children's education expenses himself and gave me fifty yuan per month for household expenses. Last September, he came to Shanghai with the first wife and lived at Number 7, Yiqing Lane, Avenyue Edward VII Road. When he left, he told me he would return to Suzhou in November. Unexpectedly, he passed away from illness in Shanghai on November 20th. The defendants, Zhou Weng, etc., did not even notify me. Because I am illiterate, a neighbor saw the obituary of the Zhou family in the newspaper and told me, and only then did I find out. I immediately brought my children from</p>
<p>Came to Attend the Funeral</p>
<p>The defendant mother and son refused to let the plaintiffs enter the door and completely seized the deceased husband's estate, disregarding the plaintiffs' livelihood. Helpless, I have no choice but to request the court to order the defendants to hand over the estate account books for calculation. Next, the defendant's attorney, Chen Huapeng, stated that the defendant, Zhou Weng, does not recognize the relationship between Xu Baozhen and the deceased husband as husband and concubine. However, they signed a separation agreement in September of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. They have lost their family and</p>
<p>Inheritance Status</p>
<p>and now have no right to order the defendant to turn over the accounts. Please reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The court then questioned the plaintiff, Xu Baozhen, who testified that I never severed the relationship with Zhou Junyu. The defendant's evidence of separation does not have my signature. Now, I will concede a point. Even if there was a separation, please see that the house I live in was rented by Zhou Junyu and lawyer Fan, with Zhou Junyu's own</p>
<p>Signature and Seal</p>
<p>The guarantor is Shi Mingsong, and the rental agreement was written by Fan's lawyer's son. The living expenses of fifty yuan per month are also evidenced by a receipt. If I had separated in the twenty-second year and until last September, would he still be willing to rent a house for me and bear the living expenses of my mother and children? After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered that the case be postponed, pending the testimony of the witnesses.</p>

<p>Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory has recently been actively raising capital. According to Mr. Zhou Bangjun, the biggest goal of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory is to manufacture industrialized chemical application raw materials and scientific pharmaceutical preparations. Therefore, on the one hand, they are sparing no effort to recruit talent, and on the other hand, they are meticulous in purchasing machinery. They have already produced dozens of kinds of injections such as Minyi Cibaoming. In addition, capsules and pills have long been sold throughout the country. The capital is set at 500,000 national currency, but after the promoters and shareholders of China-West Pharmacy purchased shares with dividends and external subscriptions, only tens of thousands of yuan are still needed. The capital raising began as early as the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, but it was interrupted by the war. This year, they are only continuing the unfinished work to complete it.

<p>Ye Qi (twenty-five years old), a resident of Room 19, Wutai Hotel, Hubei Road, Public Concession, was heard groaning in his room at 10:50 PM last night by a tea server. The server knocked on the door, but there was no response. He then found a way to open the door and entered the room. He saw that Ye's face was pale and he was unconscious. There was an empty bottle of poisonous liquid beside his pillow. Knowing that he had taken poison, he reported to the police station and summoned an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital. Because he was poisoned too severely, he died before he could be treated. The body was transferred to the mortuary for an autopsy. It was reported that a note was found in the deceased's pocket, stating that he had left a watch and requested it be donated to refugees. He regretted being trapped on an isolated island and unable to serve the country at the front line.</p>

<h3 id="e112">"Expand the Anti-Aggression Organization" <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Maolie</p>
<p>Even a lion uses its full strength to catch a rabbit. But what about Britain, the leader of the democratic countries, who is like a lion? Towards the fascist countries, who are like a pack of wolves and tigers, it only treats the symptom and not the cause, perfunctorily and tolerantly, allowing them to do whatever they want, causing endless harm? We have certainly heard loud roars; however, the actions after the roars still make us have to express disappointment!</p>
<p>She, Britain, the leader of the democratic countries, the initiator of the anti-aggression organization, although intending to prevent the fascist countries from continuing aggression, only pays attention to Eastern Europe, and ignores Southern Europe, allowing Italy to take advantage of the gaps and overthrow Albania in one fell swoop; she also only pays attention to Europe, and ignores Asia. For example, when Labor Party members inquired about inviting China and other Far East countries to join the anti-aggression organization, there was no further news. It is conceivable that Chamberlain had no intention of this, or had no time for this, allowing our enemy, another aggressive fascist country, to remain at large, running rampant without restraint. And finally, and most importantly, she only invited the generally weak countries of Eastern Europe, but abandoned the Soviet Union, which was strong enough to independently resist the fascist countries, causing the Soviet Union to stand aloof, while the German-Italian axis still dominates Europe, leaving us helpless. Given all this, I always believe that the scope of the anti-aggression movement is too narrow, its momentum is lacking, and its strength is especially weak, insufficient to rally support, establish prestige, and even more insufficient to influence and deter the aggression of the fascist countries. If this continues, I can say that the annexation of the weak in Europe will inevitably happen again, and the hegemony of the British Empire will also be shaken one day!</p>
<p>For the present, the best thing to do is to be able to organize a global anti-aggression alliance, because in this way, we can deal with the axis of the three powers as a whole; second, at least in Southern Europe, bring in Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, etc., to form another group, and in Asia, invite Annam, Siam, the Philippines, the Dutch Indies, etc., to form another group, so that we can deal with them separately. Otherwise, the future of international relations is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Britain does not seem to have such determination; not only Britain, but even Romania, which has already been threatened, is afraid of offending Germany and dare not get close to the Soviet Union. And Yugoslavia, whose danger has reached its doorstep, is even more afraid of offending Italy, and turns a blind eye to the destruction of its neighbor Albania, not daring to save it. One day, they will inevitably regret that it is too late!</p>
<h3 id="e113">Country Folk <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Green Leaves</p>
<p>In the afternoon, two country folk, both in their twenties, each carrying a wicker basket, were walking one behind the other towards the edge of the small town gate. The one in front, upon seeing the yellow-uniformed guard, bowed to him as usual, placed the wicker basket on the ground, opened the lid, and let him inspect it.</p>
<p>There was only one guard in yellow. As always, he remained silent, put on a stern face, leaned down with one hand on his gun, and rummaged through the contents of the wicker basket, throwing them onto the ground impatiently.</p>
<p>The countryman behind began to do the same as the one in front: bowing slightly, placing the wicker basket on the ground, and opening the lid. However, the guard was inspecting the first wicker basket and did not notice the second one, as it was somewhat to his side and not easily visible.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the countryman behind took out a small, black object from the second wicker basket. While the guard was looking down, he aimed the opening of that small object at his temple and pulled the trigger. With a "crack" sound, the guard fell to the ground, blood gushing from both his temples.</p>
<p>The two country folk threw the wicker baskets on the ground and turned to flee.</p>
<p>The sound startled the other yellow-uniformed men in the Guan Di Temple inside the big town gate. Five or six of them hurried out to see what had happened. At a glance, they understood the situation. They left two people to attend to the person on the ground and chased after the two who fled out of the town. However, after crossing the drawbridge and turning two corners, they reached a crossroads and had no way to proceed, so they had to stop and hesitate.</p>
<p>Of course, they did not know that the men had already escaped from that street and could not pursue them down that street. Moreover, they knew very well that no matter which street they took, it would only be half a mile to the end, and beyond that was only fields and countryside. And the fields and countryside were precisely the forbidden territory they dared not easily venture into.</p>
<p>After asking the people on the street without any result, they muttered to each other for a while and had no choice but to return to the town.</p>
<p>At the edge of the small town gate, while they were collecting their companion who had died on the ground, they carefully inspected the things on the ground. Among the various torn clothes and scattered paper scraps, they found a letter. Opening it, they saw these words inside:</p>
<p>...Don't just stubbornly stay within the city walls! If you have the guts, come down to the countryside and let's see who's better on the battlefield! If you don't come down, we will come up.</p>
<p>Now, let us give you a taste of things to come!...</p>
<p>Below was the formal signature: Li Yilong, Captain of the ×× Unit of the ×× Army.</p>
<p>Everything was handed over to the city garrison headquarters, and the commander sent someone to find Guo Lao Er to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Guo Lao Er was originally a local ruffian, despised by the villagers. Because of his meritorious service in welcoming the yellow-uniformed men, they sent him to work in the "police station." From then on, he gained power, wealth, and influence.</p>
<p>As soon as Guo Lao Er arrived, he said that this matter could not be easily let go, and at least a show of force should be made. After some discussion, they divided half of their men, about fifty or sixty, into a line and marched out of the city. When they reached the crossroads, regardless of left or right, they went straight ahead.</p>
<p>The street ended, but after two or three li, they arrived at a town. This was Guo Lao Er's hometown. When everyone saw Guo Lao Er walking at the head of a group of yellow-uniformed men, they involuntarily cast poisonous glances at him, secretly cursing: Shameless beast!</p>
<p>The yellow-uniformed men wanted to rest, and Guo Lao Er led them into the largest hotel, Huang Long Yuan. The owner, Huang Guansan, and his family hurriedly escaped through the back door, leaving only two elderly clerks to attend to them, carrying out two jugs of wine and inviting these foreign "honored guests" to drink.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the young men and women in the town had fled, leaving only the old and the young. Because they had received too many lessons, they already knew how to behave themselves.</p>
<p>It was already dusk and, of course, it was time to go back, and more importantly, they had to go back. So, with staggering steps, leading the drunken yellow-uniformed men, they walked out of Huang Long Yuan.</p>
<p>Guo Lao Er then made a suggestion to the leader, saying, "Going back like this would be a joke to the 'bandits.' We should give them a taste of our power." The leader listened to him and did these two things:</p>
<p>First, set a fire, starting with Huang Long Yuan. While burning, Guo Lao Er lectured his old neighbors:</p>
<p>—You are harboring "bandits," so you are being punished. If you do this again, we will kill every last one of you!</p>
<p>Second, Guo Lao Er wrote a barely legible note and posted it on a bridge pillar in the middle of the street, roughly saying:</p>
<p>...We have come down to the countryside, where have you all run off to! If you have the guts, come into the city!...</p>
<p>They returned safely to the town in the fading twilight, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Guo Lao Er was greatly rewarded by the commander, who said he was thorough and capable in his work, and immediately promoted him to "Police Chief."</p>
<p>Guo Lao Er's joy was imaginable.</p>
<p>The next morning, Guo Lao Er, according to his usual habit, went to the Yongchun Tea House on the west side of the "County Magistrate's Office" to drink tea and have breakfast. Because he was so happy, his face was even more beaming with joy. As soon as he sat down, he spoke to the waiter and the people sitting next to him, praising his master's "benevolent rule" and announcing his grand policies after taking office as "Police Chief."</p>
<p>While he was delivering his grand speech, a person walked in from outside. Seeing him, he bent down and said to him in a fervent tone:</p>
<p>—Police Chief Guo, there is someone outside who wants to ask you to do something, please come out and meet them.</p>
<p>Guo Lao Er looked at the person, who seemed to be a recognizable neighbor, but he couldn't remember the name.</p>
<p>—Can't you ask him to come in?</p>
<p>As he said this, his face looked a little displeased.</p>
<p>The person took another step forward and whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>—The person has confidential matters. If Police Chief Guo helps, there will be some gifts, so it is not convenient to talk here.</p>
<p>As soon as Guo Lao Er heard about the gifts, his face softened, and he stood up and followed the person out.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was already a person waiting at the entrance of the tea house. As soon as he saw Guo Lao Er come out, he greeted him and raised one hand, saying:</p>
<p>—Sending Guo Ju back to heaven!</p>
<p>At the same time, with another "crack" sound from the raised hand, Guo Lao Er fell backward, a stream of blood flowing from between his eyebrows, covering his face and the ground.</p>
<p>The people in the tea house ran outside, running in all directions. The person who invited Guo Lao Er out and the person who raised his hand also ran among them. Before long, no one knew where they, these two people, had run to.</p>
<p>The "police" arrived and found another note on Guo Lao Er's chest, which read:</p>
<p>...We have come into the town, what can you do? If you have the guts, come down to the countryside and go further away!...</p>
<p>A series of closures of the town, door-to-door searches, made a great disturbance, turning things upside down, and in the end, it only caused trouble within the city walls, and moreover, "the wild goose flies into the dark sky, what does the archer admire!"</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Some contributors have apologized for not using manuscript paper with grids. This is not necessary. As long as the lines and columns are wide enough, that's fine. Moreover, this publication welcomes the use of Chinese paper. Letter paper and envelopes should also preferably be Chinese paper, and we should not blindly promote the sales of foreign paper.</p>
<p>We hope that every submitted manuscript includes a mailing address, because some manuscripts have attached postage stamps but no address, which makes it difficult for us. We hope there will be no more such cases in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Hypocrisy <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Run Gui</p>
<p>This is a puzzle, let it swirl in my mind!</p>
<p>When I cannot figure out what to answer, I comfort myself: human hypocrisy is inherited from the most distant ancestors, and should not have any effect, or purpose; so those who display this trait are simply too skilled at using their nature. Thus, I despise humanity, and of course, I despise myself!</p>
<p>In childhood, I occasionally discovered the deception and hypocrisy of relatives, but because I knew nothing at the time, I simply took it as a matter of course for elders, or a way of dealing with the world, so I didn't care at all. Turning my back, I let my thoughts drift to kicking a small ball or playing marbles. When I entered student life, I saw this kind of behavior more often: when classmates were caught cheating by the teachers, they would definitely insist that they hadn't cheated; they especially liked to boast and brag in front of the girls, although they themselves knew that the other party only treated their words as a breeze blowing past their ears. Later, when I got to society, I saw even more shocking cases of deception of all kinds, but my heart felt even more confused and lost, and I also despised humanity even more.</p>
<p>Human hypocrisy is always all kinds of ways: some use hypocrisy to try to deceive some benefits, some for a certain thing, have to be hypocritical, as if without hypocrisy, standing in society is only like having one leg, without a support, standing unstable, even if your talent is good, the skill is high, can only float in the ethereal, a careless, throw on the ground, made a full body of wounds. Conversely, if you can flexibly become hypocritical, at least you will not be a hungry poor wretch crying and begging people "do a good deed!" In a word: hypocrisy is teaching you how to live in the world, how to survive.</p>
<p>These words seem to be close to a believer in hypocrisy, but although I do not advocate this, some facts are in front of me, but I can not help but feel this way. Look, now in society, who wants to live, who wants to be prominent, who has to be hypocritical into who has to distort to use hypocrisy. So who has only always given people spurned contempt of the share!</p>
<p>The hypocrisy to become hypocrisy, it seems that this is not accidental.</p>

<p>I have a brother on the battlefield,</p>
<p>He is usually so useless,</p>
<p>But when the flames of the Anti-Japanese War rose fiercely,</p>
<p>He ran away privately, without even leaving a letter,</p>
<p>But I consider it the supreme honor.</p>
<p>I have a brother on the battlefield,</p>
<p>He didn't take a car to the inland because he was poor,</p>
<p>He walked thousands of miles across thousands of mountains,</p>
<p>When he arrived at his destination, his heels were already swollen,</p>
<p>But I consider it the supreme honor.</p>
<p>I have a brother on the battlefield,</p>
<p>He works hard day and night, bearing heavy burdens,</p>
<p>He hasn't tasted rice and meat for three months,</p>
<p>But he wrote to me saying: comfort can only breed lazy bugs,</p>
<p>But I consider it the supreme honor.</p>
<p>I have a brother on the battlefield,</p>
<p>He started serving the people and finally resolutely joined the army,</p>
<p>He wants to swear to avenge his shame, and go straight to Huanglong,</p>
<p>He doesn't care about the hardships of military life,</p>
<p>But I consider it the supreme honor.</p>
<p>I have a brother on the battlefield,</p>
<p>I have seen him throw a seed of fire on the village,</p>
<p>I have been a dragon turning the mountains and overturning the seas by the side of Doyang Lake,</p>
<p>He is in hardship, but he never speaks of pain,</p>
<p>But I consider it the supreme honor.</p>
<p>I have a brother on the battlefield,</p>
<p>He is a young hero,</p>
<p>He has been missing since the Battle of Jiujiang,</p>
<p>From then on, perhaps, we will never see his face again,</p>
<p>But I consider it the supreme honor.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Current State of Social Education in Shanghai <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Chi</p>
<p>Social education, in its scope, is extremely broad. Shanghai, as China's largest city, boasting a population of over three million, has seen its social undertakings particularly developed to meet environmental needs. Besides government funding for initiatives, there are also numerous private endeavors. However, since the start of the War of Resistance, most of the government-sponsored programs have fallen into enemy-occupied zones. A small number of those not in occupied zones have also ceased operations due to the interruption of funding. To this day, what remains mostly consists of private initiatives, and their teaching targets are limited to citizens within the concessions, a stark contrast to the pre-war period. The following is an overview of the government-run programs that fell into Japanese hands or were suspended before the war:</p>
<p>1.  Public Education Center: The Municipal Public Education Center of this city was originally located on Wenmiao Road in South Shanghai. It was grand in scale, thriving in its operations, and achieving considerable success in various affiliated undertakings. It was truly the most complete and substantial implementing body for social education in the city. However, it fell into enemy-occupied territory after the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>2.  Libraries: The Municipal Library system originally consisted of three branches: the Shanghai Municipal Library, located in the city center; a Municipal Library branch affiliated with the Public Education Center; and a circulating library in the Old City God Temple area. Among the three, the Municipal Library was the largest in scale and the newest in construction. After the war, it was either destroyed by fire or occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>3.  Museum: Located in the city center, the building was magnificent, and the content was quite substantial. After the outbreak of the war, apart from a few precious items that were moved to safe locations, the rest were lost. Its palatial building was forcibly occupied by the puppet municipal government.</p>
<p>4.  Sports Fields: The largest in scale was the Shanghai Municipal Sports Field, whose grandeur was unparalleled in the Far East. In addition, there was the Municipal First Sports Field, located on Daji Road in South Shanghai, which was smaller in scale. The simple sports fields were scattered throughout the various townships, all of which were managed by local schools. After the war, they all fell. Some buildings of the Municipal Sports Field were even destroyed by artillery fire and have recently been occupied by the Japanese army as barracks.</p>
<p>5.  Zoo: Located on Wenmiao Road in South Shanghai, it was across from the Public Education Center. The various animals kept there, except for some that were relocated to Gujiazhai Park for public exhibition, were all casualties of the war.</p>
<p>6.  Botanical Garden: Located on Longhua Road in South Shanghai, it had been transferred to the Municipal Garden Farm before the war. Situated in a quiet and secluded location, the garden contained thousands of species of rare flowers and exotic plants, all of which fell into the hands of the Japanese army after the war.</p>
<p>7.  Public Reading Rooms: Scattered throughout the various townships of the municipality, there were no fewer than several hundred. Before the war, they were all managed by schools designated by the Social Affairs Bureau, either by posting the original newspapers or by adapting them into wall newspapers. After the war, they all disappeared with the closure of the schools.</p>
<p>8.  Literacy Schools: Shanghai began promoting large-scale literacy education in July of the 24th year [of the Republic, 1935], and by June of the 26th year [1937], six sessions had been held, each lasting six months. The implementation guidelines included two major parts: literacy education and civic education. The specific goals were to cultivate national morality, learn simple writing, impart general knowledge, improve the lives of the people, foster national consciousness, and train productive capacity. After two years of operation, significant results were achieved. A total of 317,526 people in the city had received literacy education. Even in the last session before the war, the sixth session, there were still 91 literacy schools with 368 classes, enrolling 22,262 students. According to surveys, as of before the war, only 309,334 illiterate people remained in the city. This was a reduction of more than half of the illiterate population compared to before the literacy education program. If given time, it would not have been difficult to completely eradicate illiteracy. However, since the start of the War of Resistance, this great undertaking has been suspended, which can be said to be the greatest loss in Shanghai's social education.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned social education undertakings were all managed by government agencies before the war, but have all been suspended after the war, with none remaining. In addition, there are some undertakings that were previously government-run, but a part of them have been able to relocate and resume operations. The existing social education undertakings are mostly private creations or new ventures after the war, which are also described below.</p>
<p>1.  People's Schools</p>
<p>Although People's Schools were government-run in the past and were scattered in the countryside, since the fall of Shanghai, some of the original teachers have recognized the importance of people's education and have relocated to the concessions to reopen schools. However, the number is much smaller than before, only about fourteen or fifteen. Funding is also extremely limited, so nominal fees for books and sundries are charged to supplement income. The implementation measures have also been standardized, and the main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>A. Purpose: To impart simple knowledge and skills to older, out-of-school people in accordance with the educational aims and implementation policies of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>B. School Facilities: The principle is to borrow from ordinary schools.</p>
<p>C. Students: Both male and female students are admitted, and boys and girls may be separated when necessary, but limited to those aged between sixteen and forty.</p>
<p>D. Duration: Each session lasts six months, with two hours of education per day.</p>
<p>E. Level: Divided into elementary and advanced levels. The elementary level is equivalent to the first grade of primary school, and the advanced level is equivalent to the third grade of primary school. Compound organization may be adopted.</p>
<p>F. Subject Breakdown: Chinese language: 66% of total time for elementary level, 50% for advanced level. Arithmetic: 12% of total time for elementary level, 10% for advanced level. Civic Training: 14% of total time for elementary level, 8% for advanced level. Music and Physical Education: 8% of total time for both elementary and advanced levels. General Knowledge and Simple Vocational Skills: Integrated into other subjects for the elementary level, and each accounts for 12% for the advanced level.</p>
<p>G. Teaching Materials: In addition to self-compiled materials, literacy readers, short-term primary school textbooks, Old and Young General Knowledge, and People's Readers published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation and the Commercial Press are used. Schools select materials from this range based on the students' level.</p>
<p>2.  Tutoring Schools</p>
<p>In the past year, tutoring schools in Shanghai, established by private individuals, have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, reaching more than 200 schools with about 60,000 students. The nature of each school can be broadly divided into general education and vocational education. General education focuses on supplementing language, mathematics, and general knowledge. Vocational education covers almost every department in the vocational sector. The reasons for the special development after the war are nothing more than three: first, the high desire for knowledge among low-level employees in the business community; second, ordinary school students, affected by the war, are unable to continue their studies and change their paths; and third, the general decline in private economic power, which makes it impossible to afford the cost of ordinary education for their children, so they send them to tutoring schools, hoping to acquire a skill in a short period of time to make a living. With these three reasons, tutoring schools have been able to flourish for a time, but in terms of quality, they may not yet be fully satisfactory.</p>
<p>3.  Street Children Education</p>
<p>Street children education is the latest product of adapting to environmental needs after the war. Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai and its fall into an isolated island, refugees have gathered, and street children are everywhere. Enthusiastic educators recognized the need for relief, so they raised funds and organized the Shanghai Street Children Education Association to take charge of the operation. To date, 30 street children schools have been established, totaling 50 classes, educating more than 4,000 children. All educational activities are different from schools. Teaching materials are also formulated by the Street Children Education Association, and teachers compile them at any time. The teaching time is also based on the principle of catering to the convenience of street children. School buildings are completely borrowed from public places, temples, ancestral halls, and so on. However, school buildings or civilian houses are also borrowed when necessary. The implementation points of this new undertaking are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A. Educational Purpose: To assist homeless out-of-school children aged six to fifteen, provide them with appropriate education, enable them to be physically and mentally healthy, and acquire basic knowledge and skills to adapt to real life.</p>
<p>B. Educational Methods: 1. Teaching aspects: meetings, grouping, visits, individual guidance, etc.</p>
<p>2.  Nurturing aspects: Provide medical treatment, assistance, and improvement of production methods, or introduce job opportunities, etc., in the daily life of street children.</p>
<p>C. Implementation Steps: 1. Register street children. 2. Guide teachers. 3. Contact educational venues. 4. Check physical fitness. 5. Stipulate educational time. 6. Send staff to counsel.</p>
<p>D. Teaching Schedule: 1. Teacher preparation. 2. Street children gather. 3. Cleanliness inspection. 4. Daily Meeting - singing street children's songs or reporting current affairs, common sense, and spiritual talks. 5. Special teaching activities for the whole class or in groups, such as Chinese, arithmetic, social design, and performances. 6. Singing, playing, and sports. 7. Group meetings - chaired by the group leaders to discuss group affairs.</p>
<p>4.  Refugee Education</p>
<p>As the name suggests, refugee education is also a new undertaking after the war. When the war broke out in Shanghai, refugees from the suburbs gathered in the concessions. Refugee camps were established one after another, and were separately managed by the International Relief Committee, the Joint Charity and Disaster Relief Association, the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, the Refugee Relief Branch, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and various clan associations and public organizations. At most, there were more than 220 refugee camps. The education methods were self-governed and lacked standards. Educational affairs were concurrently managed by the managers of each camp, and the methods were also different. After that, the main organizers recognized the importance of refugee education and successively set up guidance groups or education groups to preside over the education affairs of each camp under their jurisdiction, but they still only paid attention to the children's part. It was not until the International Committee of the Red Cross took on the responsibility of providing food and supplies to each camp that it established an education committee to uniformly preside over the refugee education in the city, and the career facilities were put on the right track. The refugees receiving education reached as many as 149,700 at most. As for the content of its implementation, refugee children aged six to sixteen receive children's education, divided into subjects such as Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, singing, and physical education. Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge are basic subjects and must be taught. Singing and physical education depend on the equipment, talent, and environment of each camp. The education time is at most 22 hours per week. Refugees over the age of sixteen receive adult education, divided into literacy, spiritual training, lectures, storytelling, movies, and calisthenics, with literacy education as the main focus and lectures and storytelling as supplements. The education time is at least 21 hours per week and at most 26 hours per week. Refugees with original living skills or more cleverness are given vocational education, divided into vocational training and production education. Vocational training teaches vocational knowledge and skills, and production education teaches various crafts production techniques. 22 kinds of craft production workshops have been opened, such as embroidery, sewing, carpentry, weaving, etc., and products are already on sale. If it can be persisted and promoted in spirit, it will not be difficult for consumers to change into producers.</p>
<p>5.  Lane Education</p>
<p>So-called lane education is actually equivalent to the past itinerant education, but its itinerant scope is based on lanes as the unit. Its implementation methods are very fluid. Any lane with many residents but no nearby schools is its teaching venue. School buildings are mostly borrowed from public places or spare houses of enthusiastic educators. The facilities are very simple. Except for those necessary for education, the rest are provided by the children themselves, and even tables and chairs are brought by the children. The content of education focuses on basic training, focusing on daily life knowledge and concepts and the inculcation of national consciousness. The recipients are mostly children, which seems to be classified into the scope of school education, but because the implementation methods are very different from school education, it is actually a kind of social education. The object of old social education was originally not limited to children. There are currently more than 430 people in the city receiving this lane education, divided into seven levels, scattered in seven places. When the number of out-of-school children in each place decreases, they are relocated to other lanes for education, which is also a product of adapting to the actual needs after the war.</p>
<p>6.  Newspaper Boys Education</p>
<p>Shanghai is a district where the newspaper industry converges. Thousands of children rely on selling newspapers for a living. These children shout out the important news published in various newspapers on the streets every day and run around everywhere. The influence on the public psychology is very great, and it is really necessary to give them strict training. Enthusiastic educators in this city have initiated the implementation of newspaper boys education. There are now ten newspaper boys schools, enrolling more than 400 students. In addition to giving newspaper boys daily life knowledge and language education, they pay special attention to the reporting of current affairs common sense, so that every newspaper boy can listen to the important news about current affairs every day. The teaching time is based on the principle of not hindering the children's newspaper selling time. School buildings use ordinary schools or other public places. They are currently raising funds and striving to expand.</p>
<p>7.  Public Sports</p>
<p>Public sports in Shanghai have always been developed. Before the war, the Social Affairs Bureau specially set up a public sports section to guide public sports in the city and organize amateur sports meets and walking competitions. Municipal sports fields trained the public in sports and spared no effort. The All-China Athletic Federation also hosted international sports competitions. After the War of Resistance, the above-mentioned institutions have all been suspended. However, the atmosphere of sports competitions is still booming. Except for track and field competitions, which are rarely held due to the lack of large venues, the practice and competitions of football, basketball, tennis, swimming, and other competitions are carried out as usual.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are various other social education undertakings, which are too numerous to mention. For example, after the municipal library was destroyed, private individuals set up the Dingxiang Circulating Library, the China Circulating Library, the Ding Library, and so on. In short, there are few public social education undertakings in Shanghai after the war, and many private ones, especially tutoring schools, which are the most developed. Some undertakings are jointly set up in one place, but they cannot be publicly opened to the outside world due to concession regulations, so it is not easy to conduct accurate investigations. The newly emerging social education undertakings are all needed by the wartime environment and have profound significance in the process of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Work of Various Churches in Shanghai During the Extraordinary Period <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Shuyuan</p>
<p>The history of the establishment of churches in Shanghai is already ninety years old. The first church was built at Zhengjia Muqiao. Ninety years later, today, the situation has changed greatly. The number of churches in Shanghai has reached more than seventy, of which fifty-seven churches belong to the orthodox sect, and the number of church members has reached 10,000.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Missionary Association is responsible for the liaison between the churches. The general headquarters for the publication, sale, and donation of the Bible is located at 158 Hong Kong Road, while the general publishing house for ordinary religious literature is located at Guangxuehui, 128 Bowuyuan Road. In addition, the church in Shanghai also has a radio station (call sign XMHD, frequency 760), which broadcasts for seven hours a day. In addition to sermons, the content also includes reports of religious news from around the world and at home, as well as music.</p>
<p>In August of the previous year [1937], the war in Shanghai broke out. Chinese Christian leaders in Shanghai, in view of the urgent need for relief work, initiated a luncheon party, inviting Chinese and foreign Christians in Shanghai to discuss the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees. At that time, the governments of Britain and the United States repeatedly decided to force expatriates to return home, but foreign Christians attending this luncheon were still unexpected, thus forming a united front of Christians. The organization of the Shanghai Christian Federation's relief undertaking was established at this time.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Federation, it achieved remarkable results. After the start of the war in Shanghai, refugees were everywhere. The Federation immediately started fundraising and established 18 refugee camps, accommodating 150,000 refugees, and providing them with clothing, food, and shelter for seven months. After the refugees found a livelihood, they left the camp on their own. Finally, there were only more than 2,200 refugees left, gathered at the 18th Refugee Camp, located at Changping Road, Hedde Road. There are now 400 people left, but at this time the nature is different from before. Most of the refugees are self-sufficient, and the Federation gives them considerable subsidies. In addition, the Federation has also established a tuberculosis sanatorium, specifically for refugees suffering from tuberculosis to live in.</p>
<p>Refugees in the war zone were caught off guard and could not carry their clothes. At the same time, the Federation also provided relief to refugees outside the camps who had livelihood problems. Moore Church and the Women's Self-Government Association were responsible for most of the sewing work. According to Moore Church's annual work report, 1,130 cotton mattresses, cotton quilts, and bed sheets have been made, and 129,616 pieces of clothing have been made. They are still continuing to work. Last autumn, the weather in Shanghai was getting colder, and the Federation donated a large number of cotton vests to the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem for the few refugees outside the above-mentioned camps, the Federation relieved 300,000 people of food in seven months through Moore Church.</p>
<p>Regarding the relief of wounded soldiers, the Federation was responsible for running several wounded soldiers hospitals during the war in Shanghai, and other wounded soldiers hospitals also directly or indirectly received economic and manpower assistance from the Federation. Soldiers who were seriously injured were given special diets. All wounded soldiers were given friendly comfort. Most of the young Christians volunteered to serve as nurses. After the wounded soldiers were discharged from the hospital, they wrote to express their longing for the kind care they had received.</p>
<p>After the closure of the various wounded soldiers hospitals, a Christian doctor from the West suggested that the Shanghai International Red Cross Society open a crippled wounded soldiers police academy to accommodate soldiers who had lost their legs and arms. This hospital was established on January 10 last year, and the address of the hospital was the old 17th Wounded Soldiers Hospital. The total number of wounded soldiers was 403. The hospital fitted them with prosthetic legs and arms to enable them to move. Those who were unemployed were taught living skills so that they would not wander the streets after being discharged from the hospital. After finding a new spirit of life, many of these soldiers volunteered to become Christians.</p>
<p>During the war in Shanghai, the Salvation Army, with the economic assistance of the Shanghai International Red Cross Society, established several refugee camps, one on West Yexian Road. Since the beginning of the war, it has accommodated a total of 23,000 refugees. The second refugee camp was established at Jiaotong University, which accommodated 17,000 refugees in seven months. In addition, the third refugee camp was set up on Xiaoshadu Road, accommodating 7,000 refugees, and a refugee tuberculosis hospital was set up to provide special care.</p>
<p>For homeless orphans, the Salvation Army took them in and taught them sewing, knitting socks, making shoes, carpentry, and making other daily necessities handicrafts, which have sold more than 2,000 yuan. Most of the refugees working in the camps have acquired skills to maintain their lives. After leaving the camp, they jointly contributed 80 yuan to the Salvation Army to express their gratitude and thanks.</p>
<p>Regarding the education of wounded soldiers and refugees, the Christian Federation regards it as a major task in relief work. Wounded soldiers gradually recovering in the hospital and refugees in various camps are given ordinary education, and at the same time they are also given vocational education, so that the refugees can maintain their livelihoods after leaving the camp.</p>
<p>Many residents of Nanshi have returned. Most of the houses have been burned down, and they pick up broken tiles and rubble to build walls to protect themselves from wind and frost. In view of this, the church formed the Puyi Handicraft Society in March last year. The Shanghai International Red Cross Society collects old clothes and broken socks and sends them there, where they are recycled and made into various practical items for sale. A clinic is also set up to help the poor and sick. Western doctors are responsible for voluntary work. In view of the importance of children's education, kindergartens and workers' children's classrooms have been established one after another, and because the refugees are malnourished, soy milk is made to supplement it.</p>
<p>Recently, these refugees have sought to cultivate fertile soil under dilapidated walls, broken bricks, and rubble to grow various vegetables for a living.</p>
<p>There are more than 200 people working in the handicraft society every day, and thousands of people are seeking help. Most refugees have no food or clothing and are dying. The handicraft society is also suffering from a lack of funds to hire more workers. One day, a member of the society voluntarily resigned to give the job to a more impoverished person. An old man donated eight jiao [角, unit of currency] in wages earned in eight days. This was all he had. This organization is in great need of expansion.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Shanghai YMCA’s Work During Extraordinary Times <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Introduction: Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the retreat of the National Army to the west, this YMCA, as a Christian social service organization, has upheld its inherent position and engaged in social services. Cherishing the grand aspiration of establishing oneself and others, we have strived to undertake various regular and extraordinary tasks. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our colleagues and the support and cooperation of people from all walks of life, we have achieved considerable results over the past year. At this time of upheaval, the YMCA is committed to providing practical services and encouraging the youth to maintain a positive spirit, all of which depends on the support of people from all sectors of society to benefit our fellow citizens. We hereby present a summary report on the YMCA's work over the past year, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Relief and Assistance Work: A: Refugee Camps – Since the outbreak of the war, the YMCA has successively managed six refugee camps, including the third and sixth of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the first and second of the Guangdong Native Place Association's Refugee Relief Committee, and the Shanghai Christian Federation. At its peak, the refugee population reached over 27,000. In addition to dispatching responsible staff to preside over the camps, the YMCA has placed special emphasis on life training, moral education, and knowledge and skills for productive endeavors, with the ultimate goal of cultivating the four aspects of education and promoting personal growth. Therefore, all administrative management strives for scientific approaches, daily life emphasizes discipline, and an objective attitude is adopted to achieve the goal of educating the masses. Indeed, the cleanliness and orderliness of each camp, and the well-organized life of the refugees, are clear evidence of the perfect management of each camp.</p>
<p>B: Relief for Students Out of School – Initially, recognizing the urgency of the need, we joined forces with the YWCA to raise funds to subsidize students from impoverished families who were unable to continue their education due to the direct impact of the war. The methods included: (1) providing tuition loans and travel expenses to study in the interior, establishing work-study positions, and scholarships. To date, a total of over 660 students have benefited, with a total of 17,000 yuan in relief funds disbursed. Unfortunately, due to limited financial resources, there are still over a thousand students who registered but were unable to receive assistance. (2) Establishing student economic dormitories, initially in the Sichuan Road Association, with extremely low rents. Now, the seventh, eighth, and ninth floors of the Wuzhou Building have been opened as student dormitories, with spacious interiors, an initial investment and operating expenses of 20,000 yuan, and an estimated annual operating expense of 6,000 yuan. The hope is to create a fellowship spirit for young students and realize an ideal student dormitory.</p>
<p>C: Relief for Unemployed Youth – In addition to vocational guidance work, a production education plan is being considered, divided into four groups: teaching, crafts, sales, and job placement. The "Production Education Sales Corps" was then established, with the goal of promoting the sale of domestic goods, and the number of members is temporarily limited to fifty. Since its establishment, all members have worked hard and maintained excellent morale. Moreover, the members themselves have focused on training and self-cultivation, benefiting greatly in body and mind. Unfortunately, due to the recent establishment and limitations in human resources and capital, there is still a need for large-scale expansion.</p>
<p>D: Military Service Work – At the beginning of the Shanghai War, the YMCA was invited to send personnel to serve in the Municipal Ambulance Association. In addition, personnel were dispatched to work in various wounded soldier hospitals, divided into general affairs, propaganda, personnel, comfort, service (education and entertainment), and other groups. A total of eight hospitals were served, with the 23rd Wounded Soldier Hospital being the most prominent, with a total of over 70 service personnel. In addition, condolence items were solicited and cotton vests were made. Significant contributions were made to the spiritual comfort and encouragement of wounded soldiers and officers. Unfortunately, this work could not be continued in Shanghai after the retreat of the National Army. However, now that the war zone is vast, YMCAs across the country have already combined talent and resources to engage in large-scale military service work, working tirelessly and unremittingly in the midst of hardship and danger in military zones spanning thousands of miles. There are currently dozens of branches, with over 150 service personnel formally dispatched by the National YMCA, all of whom are risking their lives to serve the officers and soldiers at the front lines and the wounded soldiers being carried back. As a result, the YMCA's reputation in the interior has become widely known. Regardless of soldiers, civilians, or the public, everyone recognizes the YMCA upon seeing the red triangle. Indeed, the service personnel, with their fearless spirit, continue to work tirelessly, thus earning the respect and faith of their fellow soldiers and compatriots, a truly great endeavor.</p>
<p>(2) Sports Work: A: Construction of Temporary Gymnasium – The YMCA's new building in Baxianqiao originally had plans to build a new gymnasium. After Shanghai became an "isolated island," youth sports became an extremely important need. Recognizing this, the YMCA, with the cooperation and support of advanced figures in the sports world and YMCA members, quickly built a temporary gymnasium on the site of the new gymnasium to meet urgent needs. It was inaugurated on July 16, with a total construction and equipment cost of over 7,000 yuan. It is now used frequently, making a significant contribution to youth health and encouraging interest in sports.</p>
<p>(3) Laborer Children Welfare Services: A: Huxi Commune – The YMCA's Huxi Commune on Lubosheng Road is specifically designed to provide welfare services for laborers. All kinds of work, such as education, religion, health, and medicine, are tailored to the real needs of the lives of the working masses. It continues to be operated, with special emphasis on the education of workers' children, with 250 students in the morning and afternoon classes, religious gatherings, health work (such as setting up children's bathrooms), and medical services, with 30 to 50 poor and sick children visiting the commune every day.</p>
<p>(4) Children's Science Laboratory: In addition to day and night schools, the YMCA's intellectual education work also includes libraries and reading rooms in the two YMCA locations. In recent years, the libraries have often been full. The collections within the libraries are rich, with books and magazines of all kinds, which greatly benefit the public's intelligence. Recently, in order to encourage children's interest in science and establish a foundation for scientific talent for the country, a Children's Science Laboratory was established in the Sichuan Road branch and officially opened in early December. Since then, both children and adults have participated. Detailed information has already been reported in the newspapers, so I will omit it here.</p>

<h3 id="e121">On "Wang Jingwei" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Wei</p>
<p>At the beginning of the War of Resistance, I remember Mr. Jingwei once saying, "Refugees are easily exploited by invaders and turned into traitors." At that time, Mr. Wang was, of course, a leading figure, and his remarks were naturally considered famous sayings. My speculation as to why refugees are easily exploited by invaders and turned into traitors is probably because a person has no confidence in the War of Resistance. In short, their will is not firm. The decision is probably driven by greed and disregard for the nation and ethnicity, willingly becoming traitors. Indeed, engaging in traitorous activities has always been referred to as a path to survival. Therefore, Mr. Wang at that time was able to have unique insight and warn refugees not to embark on this path to survival. However, today, the "path to death" is, of course, more prevalent than the "path to survival." If that is accurate, then why are the hundreds of thousands of homeless refugees on the "isolated island" willing to live the most miserable lives, struggling at the entrance to the "path to death," rather than taking the "path to survival" that Mr. Wang spoke of? The reason is simple: they hold onto a steadfast will, believing that final victory will belong to us. However, for a person who disregards shame and dignity, the "path to survival" is indeed not lacking.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang, who smeared refugees as being easily turned into traitors by invaders, has also transformed himself and revealed his true colors. However, we cannot determine whether Mr. Wang became a traitor for fame or fortune. We can understand this by reading the following telegram:</p>
<p>Chongqing, May 5 (Associated Press): Several weeks ago, a representative from Chongqing went to Hanoi to hand over his passport for traveling to Europe to Wang and gave him 200,000 yuan as expenses for traveling to Europe as a representative of the National Government for inspection. However, Wang still returned the money to Chongqing, reiterating his dignity, saying:</p>
<p>"I am not doing this for fame, nor can I be bought with money."</p>
<p>However, let's set aside the issue of whether Mr. Wang is doing this for fame or fortune. After reading the evidence of Wang Jingwei's collusion with Japan and conspiracy to betray the country published by Chongqing, I am deeply moved. Thinking of the famous poem he wrote in his youth, I cannot help but feel a sense of the contrast between the past and the present:</p>
<p>"Singing generously in the Yan market, calmly becoming a prisoner of Chu,</p>
<p>Drawing the knife to make it quick, living up to the youthful head."</p>
<p>The once sonorous verses have now been reduced to being covered in filth. How tragic that a famous person has come to this!</p>
<h3 id="e122">Embezzlement, Occupation, Theft, and Other Things <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhensan</p>
<p>Under an unsound social system, the resulting abnormal phenomena inevitably have objective factors. In other words, a person's wrongdoing is not innate. The growth of all sins is based on the abnormal attraction in the real society. In a city with both good and bad elements, people who generally do not have the power to control their reason are often confused by certain things and take certain things as the object of realizing their desires or entrusting their emotions, resulting in irremediable bad results. This is an undeniable general situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai, a city of sin, has always been a place where people use fraud and deception to pursue material things. Recently, the number of gambling dens in western Shanghai and the impact they have on people with wavering wills have further accelerated the speed at which Shanghai produces sin, which is truly chilling.</p>
<p>In recent months, looking at the social news section of the newspaper, there have been records of business fraud, embezzlement, theft, and other bad consequences caused by entering and exiting gambling dens, almost every day, especially among salaried workers.</p>
<p>These salaried workers enter and exit gambling dens. Apart from a few gamblers who overestimate their abilities, I think they must have a fluke in their minds. In the current situation of rising prices, the lifestyle of salaried workers is naturally quite difficult. Expecting to increase material enjoyment is like "drawing a cake to satisfy hunger." Therefore, they open up other paths, hoping to enrich their lives with windfall gains, and enter and exit gambling dens. Unfortunately, the tragic consequences are simply ignored and disappear without a trace in their minds.</p>
<p>However, after entering the gambling den, no force can stop the growth and spread of sin, and no method can avoid bad consequences. They take their meager salary income and walk in, but not only do they have no hope of getting lucky and winning money, but they don't even have enough to bet, and they lose everything as soon as they lose. Therefore, they want to make a comeback after losing, and the money to make a comeback will inevitably be lost again, again and again, the more they sink, the more money they lose. All the money they depend on to live is exhausted, and their lives cannot stop without food and clothing. Under such double pressure, distorted thoughts and actions are bound to arise as a result. Not long ago, the newspaper reported: A bank clerk was discovered to have committed fraud, a shop assistant was discovered to have embezzled, a certain accountant owed a certain amount, and the wife and daughter's jewelry and clothes were mortgaged and exhausted, causing constant quarrels, which is really endless. And recently, it was reported that a certain silk shop partner stole several pieces of silk and was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. The root of these phenomena is the same, because they have to pay off the gambling den, and some even use this kind of money as gambling money. As a result, they have tasted the flavor of iron windows, which harms their wives and children and harms society. The power of the gambling den is really terrible!</p>
<p>These are still visible facts. Other things that have not been announced in the newspapers are even more numerous, and the number is several times more than those sentenced to several years or months in prison, right? This kind of social consequence is, on the one hand, due to the deformity of society, and on the other hand, it is also because the general public lacks determination and cannot control themselves. Knowing that there will be no good results, they still dare to try it, not to mention that this kind of gambling den is cultivated under special forces! For the current plan, it would be good to completely eradicate this kind of gambling den that kills people without using knives. Secondly, I also hope that the general public will wake up and not be too fascinated. At the same time, I hope that employers will pay full attention to the lives and actions of employees, rather than prevent them beforehand and try to remedy them afterwards. It is really a win-win solution. If there are embezzlements, occupations, thefts, etc. due to entering and exiting gambling dens, and there is a commotion in society, the person's entry, reputation, and integrity are naturally bankrupt, and the employer's side also has the shortcomings of imprecise management and unsound internal organization exposed.</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Romantic Female Ghost <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>"Topper Takes A Trip"</p>
<p>I have mentioned in a certain film that Chinese films were once also making films about demons, gods, and ghosts. The main motivation for this cannot but be said to be influenced by American films. American films have horror films such as "Zombie" and "Old House Monster," and we also have "Old House Walking Corpse" and "Cold Moon Poem Soul." People have "London Werewolf" and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," and we also have "Human-Ape Transformation." From these examples, we can resolutely say that the Chinese Film Censorship Board must insist on the past regulations prohibiting the screening of supernatural and horror films. These films are not only of no benefit to individuals, but their legacy is even more unimaginable. Looking at the example of Chinese film companies imitating and making supernatural and horror films, we hope that the Chinese government can immediately restore the pre-war inspection system and absolutely prohibit this kind of boring and ghostly film.</p>
<p>"Romantic Female Ghost" can be seen from the name what kind of content it contains. Regardless of whether this kind of film only wants to use photography techniques to deceive the audience, its objective effect is only one, that is, to make people believe that there is a ghost. For this kind of film, even if you are a skillful advertising propagandist, you have no way to explain "This is a dignified and educational film"!</p>
<p>Therefore, turning it around, precisely because of its distorted concept, it can anesthetize the audience, weaken the Chinese will to resist the war, and make the Chinese audience indulge in the heresy of these gods, monsters, demons, and ghosts. We also demand that the Chinese government prohibit the import and screening of such films.</p>
<p>"Romantic Female Ghost" can be said to be a sequel to "Romantic Samadhi." The main actors are still the original two protagonists: Constance Bennett and Roland Young. The beginning of the story re-narrates the origins of the male and female ghosts in "Romantic Samadhi." The following writes that banker Topper wants to find his wife, so he goes to Europe with the female ghost.</p>
<p>The story is empty. From beginning to end, the playwright only uses photography techniques to make objects automatically appear out of thin air and the female ghost overlaps and appears to win the audience's laughter. However, after four or five times, when the audience is accustomed to that old trick, the audience feels bored and does not feel funny at all. The playwright also reveals several weaknesses in the script writing: (1) Because it relies too much on these photography techniques, the characters it describes have no emotions; (2) In order to only use these chaotic magic tricks to deceive the audience, the script writing is very loose and messy; (3) It has never been considered to care for the atmosphere in the scene, so although the female ghost still tries her best to perform, it has not aroused the audience's interest; (4) The ending of the whole play is flat and relaxed, and there is no dramatic climax at all, so the reconciliation of Topper and his wife in the end makes people feel reluctant and weak.</p>
<p>If you want to point out a good point of the whole play, then it is the fact that a woman who thinks she is a noblewoman does not know it and actually drinks champagne with a servant's brain. After she knows he is a servant, she immediately stands up, her face changes, and she drives him out. Using such a satirical tone to write about the depth of the class concept of ordinary people is the most real thing in the whole film.</p>
<p>Roland Young plays this kind of role very well. Constance Bennett's female ghost does not have any special highlights. I think anyone can play this kind of role.</p>

<p>Because of this, the two Miss Si very much wanted to go to Freedom Village sooner. They heard that Freedom Village was a new village, and all the planning was new. They had already asked Zhu Airen to ask her grandfather if there was a suitable address for setting up a textile factory? Village Chief Zhu Laoyuan replied in his letter: "There is plenty of land here. There is land along the highway, there is land along the river, and there is land with convenient land and water transportation. Please come to Freedom Village and survey the terrain yourself. However, Freedom Village has been developing very well recently, and quite a few people have come here to build factories. It would be more appropriate to come earlier." Zhu Airen told them what her grandfather meant, and they were even more eager to go to Freedom Village to see it. Zhu Airen promised to accompany them to Freedom Village this Sunday. However, Airen was a little hesitant in her heart, because she could not easily leave the hospital for a day, and she could not always accompany them in Freedom Village. What about her mother? She is very sincere and straightforward in treating people. But to be honest, she is still from a peasant family after all. How can she get along with these two rich daughters, who have been in the Golden Yuan Country for many years? Unless she accompanies them there and then accompanies them back again, letting them live in Anle Town again. Otherwise, she will leave them in Freedom Village and let them fumble around on their own. Or perhaps the old grandfather has a way to entertain them, which is also unknown. Later, after thinking carefully, she came up with someone. It turned out that Zhu Airen had a cousin named Zhu Aiqun, who lived in Freedom Village. This Zhu Aiqun was three years older than Airen. She was also a female midwife. She was also a nurse in this Women and Children's Hospital. Now she is a midwife. When Mr. Zhu organized Freedom New Village, everything was new. The old-fashioned midwives used by rural people had no place to stand. Women in labor could no longer be subjected to the surgery of ignorant old women. If they could not be sent to the hospital, they had to be delivered according to the new method. However, Freedom Village was still a little far from the Women and Children's Hospital in Anle Town, which was inconvenient for many women. At that time, there were still few villagers in Freedom Village, and it was not worthwhile to set up a branch there. Therefore, Village Chief Zhu and Doctor Zhang discussed it and said it would be better to send Zhu Aiqun to Freedom Village. Zhu Aiqun was working as a nurse in the hospital, and she had a lot of experience in obstetrics and gynecology, which Doctor Zhang trusted. She was also the granddaughter of Mr. Zhu, so she could be said to be suitable for the people and the place. When she came to Freedom Village, Airen had not yet returned from the United States, and it had already been three years. (83)</p>

<h3 id="e126">Yen and Sword (Continued - Conclusion) <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>This article is written by the famous American economic journalist G. Stein and published in the March issue of "Pacific Affairs" magazine. We are very grateful to Mr. Wu Te-gong for taking the time to translate it. The first three sections were published in the previous issue of this journal. The first section describes the Japanese side's obstruction before and after China implemented the legal tender policy, and reveals the causes and consequences of the Japanese side's obstruction and the inside story of its failure. The second section reveals the position of the legal tender market in the current war of resistance and the general situation of the currency war launched outside the military war of resistance. On the one hand, it points out the role of the Japanese side in organizing the "Yen Bloc," and on the other hand, it explains in detail the power of the legal tender counterattack. The third section focuses on the yen itself, criticizing the background of its engagement in the currency war and the key points of its strategy. The following sections further analyze the background of the "Yen Bloc," explaining the strengths and weaknesses of its combat power and the success or failure of its combat future. The author's vision is sharp, and the translation is faithful and powerful. After reading it, one can understand that the author's title "Yen and Sword" is merely a satire. Furthermore, in the previous issue, the original magazine title and article title "Yen and Sword" were reversed in typesetting. We hereby correct it. - Editor</p>
<p>Currency Occupation and Market Seizure</p>
<p>Before this war, Japan was very dissatisfied with the amount of its exports to China. In 1936, the last year of peace, China, with 400 million buyers, accounted for only 4.4% of Japan's total exports to foreign countries and colonies; this figure was equal to 16.3% of China's total purchases from foreign countries. Now, look at how different the situation is for Japanese exporters in areas that are already under solid Japanese rule, where there is no foreign currency interference, and where the yen has become dominant! Each Japanese territory, although far smaller in area and population than China, purchased more Japanese goods in 1936 than China, which Japan often declares it desires to "cooperate" with and which has the largest population in the world.</p>
<p>Taiwan, Japan's oldest colony, with a population of just over five million, accounted for 6.8% of Japan's total exports. This means that Taiwan purchased 83.3% of its foreign goods from its "mother country," 9.1% from other Japanese territories, and only 7.6% from non-Japanese areas. Korea, Japan's second largest colony, with a population of 23 million, purchased Japanese goods accounting for 18.5% of Japan's total exports, which is equal to 85.1% of Korea's total imports. The remaining 8.7% of imports came from other Japanese territories, so Korea's purchases from foreign countries accounted for only 6.2% of imports. Manchukuo, which has only been under Japanese rule for a short time, has not yet reached the ideal state of relying on its elder brother for "cooperation," but it has made great progress in this direction. In 1930, the year before the September 18th Incident, the purchases of Japanese goods by its 30 million residents were less than 6.4% of Japan's total exports, but by 1936, it had increased to 14.8%. In 1930, Japanese goods accounted for 39.3% of Manchukuo's total purchases from foreign countries, and by 1936, it had increased to 75.1%. The remaining 22.8% was supplied by foreign merchants, most of which were goods used directly or indirectly by the Kwantung Army for military preparations within "Manchukuo." In 1936, the three major Japanese territories purchased Japanese goods accounting for 40.1% of Japan's total exports, while China accounted for 4.4%, and countries completely outside Japan's sphere of political influence accounted for 55.5%.</p>
<p>Judging by analogy with Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo," after the "Yen Bloc" has controlled the occupied areas and the suppressed parts of China for several years, at least in theory, China will allow the Japanese Empire to supply about 70% to 80% of its import needs. But even then, the amount of Japanese goods purchased by China, based on pre-war 1936 estimates, will likely still not reach 20% of Japan's total exports. In other words, the benefit that 400 million Chinese people, whom Japan is still making great efforts to suppress, give to Japanese exporters has not exceeded the total contribution of 27 million Taiwanese and Koreans in 1936. Even then, 40% of Japan's total exports will still need to be sold in foreign markets outside the "Yen Bloc," which means that the main factor for the continued active expansion of Japanese exports will still be the willingness of foreign countries to purchase more. However, if Japan can completely incorporate China into the "Yen Bloc," it can have a good opportunity to gradually reduce China's current relatively high economic self-sufficiency, so that Japan can make China more dependent on Japan for increased supply, just as Japan is now harboring this goal for Taiwan and Korea, and manipulating "Manchukuo" to a certain extent. Having said that, this matter is still a long way off.</p>
<p>Now, Japan has begun to incorporate most of the places it occupies in China into the "Yen Bloc" by nominal means. Trade between Japanese and occupied areas is now officially called "Yen Bloc Trade," the same as trade between Japan and Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo." According to the regulations promulgated by the Japanese military authorities in North China, the banknotes of the newly established "United Reserve Bank" have been used as legal tender in a wide area and can be fully exchanged for yen; the bank's financial policy is entirely controlled by the Japanese. In addition to the "United Reserve" banknotes, the original yen and "Manchukuo" banknotes have been forcibly fixed at the same value and are circulating in North China. However, the total amount of these three currencies combined is far less than the total amount of Chinese legal tender in North China. Chinese legal tender is still widely used among the people, and it is by no means only used in inland counties that have not been reached by the Japanese army. It still occupies a superior position among the people, and although there are prohibitions against using it again, and severe punishments for anyone found using "old banknotes" without exchanging them for "United Reserve" banknotes at an 80% discount, it is of no effect. The new situation in North China has allowed Japanese exports to flood the market. According to Japan's officially published trade reports, in the first eight months of 1938, monthly exports to North China averaged three times higher than before the war in 1936. If we calculate the exports indirectly transported to North China through the Kwantung Leased Territory (a large number of Japanese goods were smuggled through this route before the war, until recently when it stopped), its total amount, although the total amount of North China's purchases from foreign countries has been greatly reduced due to the war, still seems to be more than twice as high as two years ago. The emergence of the "Yen Bloc" in Central China has so far relied more on the circulation of military scrip issued by the Japanese army to meet military and commercial needs, and is gradually expanding, but Japanese exporters are also eagerly taking advantage of their opportunities there. During the same period, the average monthly increase in Japanese exports to these areas was naturally smaller, because the purchasing power and economic organization within the territory had been completely destroyed; but the amount of Japanese goods in Central China's total imports has increased by about four times. In the newly occupied areas of South China, Japanese "military scrip" has begun to be used, and similar developments are expected. These advances are achieved by depriving the interests of third countries and Chinese domestic manufacturers. Although Japan has increased the Japanese export market and excluded other countries by forming the "Yen Bloc" in the conquered Chinese war zone, and seems to have embarked on the path of realizing the first goal, it is currently not impossible to cope with the second goal, otherwise the "Yen Bloc" will eventually suffer a tragic failure.</p>
<p>Plunder of Raw Materials and Plunder of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Japan proper also has a long-standing and continuous need to import a large number of goods, especially raw materials that Japan itself does not produce. This requires foreign exchange to purchase these goods in markets with abundant world inventory. Japan's import needs are increasing with the increase in its military preparations and the expansion of its industrial equipment. Japan is eager to rely on controlling new sources of raw materials and foreign exchange income to become less dependent on foreign countries in the import market. This is another motivation for the war against China, and another reason for trying to expand the "Yen Bloc" to conquered lands. It can be seen that the success or failure in this regard is the main factor on the conditions of the future success or failure of Japan's efforts to expand the export industry with the "Yen Bloc." In terms of the supply of imported goods, the results given by the Japanese Empire are not as good as those given to the export market. Before this war, the three major territories accounted for the following parts of Japan proper's total exports: Taiwan 9.8%, Korea 14.2%, "Manchukuo" 6.3%, totaling 30.3%. The food needed by Japan is supplied by these three places, (food actually accounts for most of the goods sold by the three places to the "mother country.") But the part of the important raw materials and other goods needed by the three places in Japan's industrial needs in the total number of imports is much less than the above numbers. China's pre-war exports to Japan accounted for 4.2% of the total amount Japan proper purchased from foreign countries, and now China's most important commercial cities have been incorporated into the "Yen Bloc," and Japan is now trying its best to take advantage of the opportunity to import more goods from China. But the result is disappointing to the Japanese, although the Japanese can reach out and take all the valuable items they see in the occupied areas, and exclude foreigners who purchase Chinese products; although the Japanese no longer need to use foreign exchange to purchase goods in China; although the Japanese depress prices and force purchases, or often confiscate things in practice, as they usually do at home.</p>
<p>In the first eight months of 1938, the average monthly number of Japanese imports from North China increased by three and a half times compared to 1936. During this period, there was still a major military disturbance in Central China, and Japanese imports from the region had fallen to only one-fifth of what they used to be. But once the situation in the territory is similar to that in North China, the same increase can be expected. Finally, Central China's profit sources will also be squeezed in the same way. Although the Japanese development plan has these possible hopes, the victory makes Japan less dependent on other foreign countries for its needs because of China. This is another reason why Japan is taking advantage of the perfect opportunity to incorporate half of China into the "Yen Bloc"; not only to completely squeeze out every kind of Chinese raw material useful to Japan, but also to make China supply as much foreign exchange as possible to pay for Japan's continuous purchases from foreign markets. Therefore, the main problem that Japan's "Greater Yen Bloc" must deal with is foreign exchange. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Empire was extremely dissatisfied with foreign exchange. Now, let's go back to 1936, when Korea and Taiwan, like Japan proper, suffered from a shortage of foreign exchange. Although the total amount of goods they purchased from foreign countries, that is, non-Japanese countries, was small, it still exceeded the total amount sold to these countries by a lot. In 1936, their total excess of people was paid by Japan in foreign exchange, totaling 57.3 million yen.</p>
<p>According to official foreign trade reports, Japan's own excess of people in the same year totaled 70.8 million yen, but the largest part of the excess of people, (in 1936, Japan had to pay a huge amount for this, and used up all the free gold reserves of foreign exchange, and at the beginning of the war in 1936, it was beaten to start selling a huge number of gold.) is related to "Manchukuo" and its transshipment port of Dalian in the Kwantung Leased Territory. These two Japanese territories are the initiators of the "Yen Bloc," and their excess of people totaled 25.87 million yen. The difference in their import and export trade is indeed entirely due to the fact that the total amount they purchased from the "mother country" far exceeded the total amount they sold to the "mother country." But because this kind of trade between Japan proper and the "Manchukuo" Kwantung Leased Territory is not truthfully recorded in Japan's so-called foreign trade reports, and because both parties, by analogy, deliberately reduce Japan's excess of people to the minimum number, this difference should be listed as the largest of the three items used to make up for the total number of comparative shortages in the trade between the Japanese Empire and various countries. If "Manchukuo" is incorporated into the "Yen Bloc" and fails to enable Japan to provide for its own use the excess foreign exchange obtained from the high amount of soybeans sold by "Manchukuo" in transactions with non-Japanese foreign countries, then the above difference may increase by more than 100 million yen. This point cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Japan's Absolute Emptiness of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Japan's foreign exchange problem is now even more serious than before. In the first year of the war against China, Japan had spent 50% of its gold reserves, and this gold had to be sold overseas in order to offset the trade deficit of the empire. Moreover, during this year's war, Japan also purchased a large amount of military supplies to maintain its inventory, and only the three items of cotton, wool, and American wood used up 80%, 70%, and 60% respectively. And the foreign raw materials that are usually needed have been reduced to the extent that they cannot continue to maintain imports. If this continues, then the export industry of Japanese manufactured goods such as cotton cloth, which contains foreign raw materials, will be in danger of complete cessation. Therefore, the foreign exchange problem has made the Japanese leaders even more uneasy, and they are even more doubtful about whether it is beneficial to gradually expand export trade within the "Yen Bloc" region. Most of the exported goods contain raw materials that Japan needs to purchase in the world market with foreign exchange. Although the export trade to the "Yen Bloc" region has expanded, the imports from this region have not expanded equally, and the foreign exchange received from the exports sold to foreign countries. The increase in the excess of people that Japan has incurred in trade with its newest territories is now indicated by the following numbers: Japan's exports to the non-colonial part of the "Yen Bloc" averaged 41.5 million yen per month in 1936, but in the first eight months of 1938, it has increased by more than double, but during the same period, Japan's average number of non-colonial imports subsidized by the various foreign countries' yen blocs was only 19.9 million yen in 1936, and only 49 million yen in 1938. Japan has also not continued to receive much foreign exchange from these newly obtained places. The net amount of foreign exchange received from the trade surplus outside the "Yen Bloc" of "Manchukuo" can be regarded as a gift to Japan. In 1936, it was 13.3 million yen per month, but in the first six months of 1938, "Manchukuo's" trade with foreign countries showed a monthly deficit of 2 million yen, which had to be offset by Japanese appropriations. Japan may be able to continue to obtain a considerable amount of foreign exchange in North China and Central China. Japanese personnel are currently relying on the active assistance of the army in those two places, trying their best to collect Chinese legal tender in exchange for "United Reserve" banknotes, or yen banknotes, or to pay for Japanese exports, but the Chinese government is currently implementing a policy of maintaining legal tender so that it can be exchanged for foreign exchange, so the benefits obtained by Japan are indeed not very large. The fact that legal tender still occupies a dominant position in most occupied areas and that the general public is unwilling to let it fall into the hands of the Japanese is indeed the main obstacle encountered by the "Yen Bloc" in these areas.</p>
<p>People only need to think a little about Japan's position of having a trade surplus in its trade with the new land in the "Yen Bloc" to easily understand why Japan should not encourage exports to various places in the "Yen Bloc." At least, it should not transport various manufactured products containing foreign raw materials, or that can be sold for foreign exchange in the world market, to various places that have joined the "Yen Bloc." These leased lands are now regarded too much as an important part of Japan's domestic market. In the mainland, like Japan in general, all kinds of trade regulations are drawn up with negative significance to prevent goods from being sold to second-class customers who cannot pay in other currencies and can only pay in yen or yen-dependent banknotes. This is not only very difficult for Japanese exporters, but also greatly frustrates the soldiers who are eagerly promoting Sino-Japanese "cooperation." Therefore, Japan now feels that only by fully controlling China's exports to third countries and confiscating the foreign exchange obtained from this trade for the application of the "Yen Bloc" can Japan's trade obtain various benefits from the newly emerging currency alliance, and these benefits will be the spoils of victory.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempts to Destroy the Whole Thing</p>
<p>Japan's aggressive path in China is, at least for the time being, blocked because it cannot control the foreign exchange income from China's exports to third countries. There is also a more important reason: Japan's new currency used in North China is just a piece of paper that can only be exchanged for another kind of paper (non-convertible yen.) has proven to be a major failure, so Japan is hesitant to withdraw the "yen military scrip" in Central China according to the original plan and use the same currency. This kind of "military scrip" cannot even be a legal tender in "Liberated New China" and can never get the trust of any Chinese that the Japanese army's bayonets cannot reach. When Chinese currency can still be exchanged for foreign exchange, any new currency must at least have a part of China's current foreign exchange income as a backing in order to get the opportunity to compete with Chinese legal tender and gradually abolish it. Therefore, to achieve economic victory in the war against China, if they can get it, there is still a vicious circle that must be broken: because they cannot have the Chinese currency that allows exports to flow, they cannot control China's export trade to third countries; because the inherent value of Chinese legal tender far exceeds the substitutes they use, they cannot control or destroy China's "old currency"; because if they want to create a better substitute before Chinese legal tender is completely destroyed, the only obvious way is to make this substitute freely convertible to gold yen or gold pounds. In the current situation, it can only be exchanged by transporting Chinese products to foreign countries, so it is impossible for them to create a better substitute for this Chinese legal tender. The Japanese are now using bayonets to carry out this work, trying to reduce the flow of Chinese products to the world market, but not only have they failed to achieve the desired effect, but they have also encouraged their exports. Therefore, the construction of the "Yen Bloc" in China is still far from completion. No matter what kind of economic and financial close relationship there is between today's Crystal Book and its permanent control of the territory on the one hand, and the estimated area in China on the other hand, this relationship is still completely based on the wild efforts of the Japanese army; a closer and more coercive force of the monetary union has not yet been truly realized. Even if a "peace agreement" is reached between the two countries, even if this peace agreement allows Ben to fulfill its desire to rule China, it is difficult to expect this situation to change quickly.</p>
<p>At the same time, Japan is currently using force to at least lay the foundation for those economic policies, hoping that the monetary institutions of the "Yen Bloc" will eventually operate smoothly, effectively, and almost automatically, so that the encroachment on the interests of China or third countries will not be too obvious; and is preparing to have Chinese members implement modern methods of controlling foreign exchange in the name of "New China" to replace the brutal intervention in trade and industry that Japanese army and navy officers are currently accustomed to. An elaborate discriminatory bureaucracy - such as hot photos, quotas, restrictive regulations, donation taxes and tax rule manipulation, credit loan regulations, etc., Japan has developed all of this in its country and its territories into its own extremely successful recent feudalism, together with the powers of the two major patent enterprises (North China and Central China Development Company) that have been given to Japan, is now quietly planning to fulfill Japan's ambitions. This is nothing more than turning China into a major part of the Yen Bloc, like Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo"; developing various Chinese products useful to Japan; turning other things that now or in the future may cause competition with Japanese industry into nothing; turning China's pre-war vast and growing self-sufficiency into complete dependence on Japan; and reducing the economic exchange between China and the world outside the Yen Bloc to the extent that it suits Japan's own needs. But Japan wants to achieve this economic victory over China and the long-established Western interests. The prospect is bleak, and it is difficult to achieve the goal for a while, because Western interests and China's modern progress are closely integrated and have become a legitimate and independent unit throughout the country. Even if Japan can achieve this economic victory due to Western resistance or the inability to maintain China's long-term war of resistance, it seems that there is still no certainty that Japan's economic problems will be resolved within the "Greater Yen Bloc."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Wartime China's Economic Diplomacy (Continued) <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaomei</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Xiaomei is a renowned Chinese and foreign economist who has served as the director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China and sponsored the National Institute of National Economy of China. It is said that Dr. Zhang has also been appointed as the deputy director of the soon-to-be-established National Southwest Economic Research Institute. This article is a chapter from Dr. Zhang's newly compiled "China and Foreign Economic Yearbook," published by the National Institute of National Economy of China. Dr. Zhang kindly provided this journal with permission to publish it before the yearbook was released, and we began disclosing it in the last issue of the journal. The first section discusses how economy is key to the success or failure of modern warfare, and points out the importance of economic diplomacy. The second section records the international economic movements to resist aggression. The third section observes the achievements of our country's economic diplomacy over the past year. At that time, it only mentioned the diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and the economic relations between China and Britain and China and France. It was not until this issue that we were able to continue publishing it. This was due to limited space. Therefore, we have extracted the main points of the above article to coordinate the beginning and the end. We hope that the author and the readers will understand the delays.</p>
<p>China-UK. Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, our country's coastal ports have been threatened. Tianjin and Shanghai bore the brunt. The focus of foreign trade initially shifted to South China, relying on Hong Kong as an opening. However, the situation in Guangzhou was precarious and eventually untenable. Therefore, from the beginning, the government was eager to find another way to open the "back door," so that foreign supplies and native product exports could still flow smoothly without hindrance.</p>
<p>The滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] Road had been discussed long ago. The British side had also long intended to open up trade in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. However, it was not until the promotion of the War of Resistance that hundreds of thousands of people worked day and night to complete the entire line in a few months, and it was opened to traffic in July of the thirty-eighth year. Thus, Sino-British economic cooperation was further advanced.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] Road, there have been rumors that the British will provide loans to build the滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] Railway. When Japan openly overturned the Nine-Power Treaty and put forward the so-called Greater East Asia New Order, clearly excluding the rights and interests of foreign businessmen, the British and American sides took joint action and discussed retaliation against Japan. On December 6, the London news of the Chinese-English newspaper, "字林西報," said that the Chinese government planned to build a thousand miles of the华西 [Western China] Railway and had ordered 850 steel plate cars from the British Leeds company, and also ordered 25 miles of building rails in preparation for first connecting Kunming and Dali, and then seeking expansion.</p>
<p>On December 15, Havas News Agency's London news confirmed that the Sino-British loan had been agreed in principle, and a loan of 10 million pounds would be given to the Chinese government for the construction of the railway from 下关 [Xiaguan] (near Dali in Yunnan) to the滇緬 [Yunnan-Burma] border. The railway project will be managed entirely by British businessmen and assisted by the Export Guarantee Bureau. However, it is said that the cost of the railway is only 6 million pounds, and the remaining 4 million pounds can be used to purchase other railway materials and trucks. In addition, there are also rumors that the British "credit to China" this year is only 500,000 pounds, and the newly established Central Exchange Equalization Fund's new loan of 5 million pounds is the sound of Britain's decision to use its financial resources to help China.</p>
<p>Although British and American loans are commercial in nature, they are not without political implications. Therefore, the national opinion unanimously welcomes them, such as妇纳之, with five points: (1) At this time when the War of Resistance is turning into the first stage, foreign loans, no matter how large or small, can encourage the people and inspire morale; (2) It shows British and American friendship; (3) It consolidates our determination to honor our debts; (4) The political nature of which is quite noteworthy: (5) It is bound to arouse Japanese opposition, but we are increasingly confident that we can break the illusion of the aggressor's Asian empire.</p>
<p>China-France. Sino-French relations have always been very good. According to the 밀勒 [Millard's] Review of the Far East [談論報] on May 7, in the article "Southwest Welcomes Foreign Investment" (author Wong Hin), it is said that "a French banking group has established a loan with the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company. The railway management is entirely under the responsibility of the Sichuan-Guizhou Company. Only two French experts are hired to supervise the project during the construction period. All materials are purchased in the open market; the loan guarantee is provided solely by the China Construction Bank (wholly Chinese-operated). The debt collection matters are assisted by the Debt Committee organized by the railway company." According to the article on French Influence in China in the famous New York magazine Far Eastern Survey on May 28, this loan is estimated to be 34.5 million Chinese national currency, of which 7 million is paid in cash, and the remaining 27.5 million is used to purchase materials.</p>
<p>The above loan method, which is purely a commercial investment and eliminates any additional conditions, has set a precedent for Sino-foreign economic cooperation. In the 四南 [Southern Sichuan] Railway plan, there is one from Guangxi Nanning to the Vietnamese border, which is related to the heavy legal interests. Now that British and American loans have started, France has responded.</p>
<p>In the midst of the destruction of war, we are still gaining the trust and assistance of the great powers, while the Japanese side's activities in the world only result in consistent accusations. This is because of our country's wartime economic diplomacy achievements, and it is also because our country's War of Resistance is a mission that any nation should have for independent survival; and in order to ensure peace in East Asia, even the cooperation of various countries around the world with China's wartime economy should be progressing steadily.</p>

<p>The transaction of new lead wire has been exceptionally exciting recently. Various gangs in Qingdao and Yantai are vying to buy it, so the transaction is smooth and prosperous. The sales volume of the Tianjin gang is particularly high, so the opening has reached four or five thousand bundles in the past few days. The spot goods on the market have been searched and emptied, and the market price is increasing steadily. At the moment, the coarse color is sold for 22.5 yuan, the medium-grade color is sold for 21 yuan, and the fine color is extremely scarce in the market. The standard opening price has risen from 27.5 yuan to 30 yuan. The 24th and 25th colors are even more popular because the new goods are not available. For example, the 24th is sold for 35 yuan, and the 25th is sold for 40 yuan (the highest record of the market price of new lead wire), but customers are still willing to enter, but unfortunately there is no goods to buy, so the latecomers have the sorrow of having no goods to buy.</p>

<p>The price of tin foil in the 清明 [Qingming] Festival news has gradually increased, but some people in the industry expect that there will be a return to peace after the festival, but Ningbo suddenly announced the blockade, and the source was blocked. The existence in the festival news has been extremely digested. Although the source can be transferred from Wenzhou and Taizhou to Shanghai, the cost of the commission will inevitably increase. The manufacturers will move the goods stored in the Shanghai warehouse before the period and increase the price by 2 yuan per large piece. The local foil merchants convened a temporary meeting the day before yesterday and decided to increase the wholesale and retail prices appropriately to maintain costs, but the increase was not enough, and it may be necessary to increase it again when necessary, but the digestion has indeed decreased云.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Inside Story of Woolen Cloth Trading <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Fushi Sheng</p>
<p>(1) Business Experience</p>
<p>The business experience in commerce is like unpredictable changes, as Mr. Longju Sheng said, "Everyone can do magic tricks, and each has different skills." And the sales transactions in our woolen cloth industry are naturally different from the changes inside the yarn industry. Now let's talk about the business experience of changing sales transactions! Whether it is a firm or a factory, a street broker, or a seller, holding samples to solicit business everywhere, in addition to the brand-new and cheap goods that everyone knows, all say that they are newly arrived goods, new products, and new colors. Once the buyer "selects and wants to use to discuss the market," they all say: the stock is limited, it is popular and selling well, a certain number wants to absorb Gongduan [exclusive control], and has returned the price but not sold; a certain two numbers have added two purchases; a certain point or one-tenth of a class of words. If you encounter old colors, then Yun: in the future, you are not willing to cheapen, and the number of people, such as the number of people, are returning the price, but they are not willing to. At present, they need money and want to sell the goods for money urgently. It is really a loss-making price cut. If you want to buy, it is really a good opportunity. Get there first, to avoid Xiang Yu. If the price cannot be calculated, the price of selling to a certain number is a few, and it is not necessary to publicize it. For example, "buy one or two匹 [pi]," and say: this is your face, according to the law, add a 疋 [pi] discretionarily. Also, if it is actually tacitly approved with a stamp or with a check, then Yun: if it is someone else's, it must be done in cash. On the contrary, the buyer's customers, when they encounter happy and tasteful people, mostly say no, and deliberately "set up a shelf" because they want to bargain. In short, this kind of business experience is all about you cheating me, and even selling personality to swear to people. It can also be seen that the "business experience" is full of treacherousness and tricks. Recently, the situation has changed greatly, and everyone feels that this is not what commercial ethics should have. The false habits should be eliminated, and sincerity should be bred. This is the real "business experience"!</p>
<p>(2) Wholesaling Goods</p>
<p>The price of wholesaling original boxes of goods is fairer than拆疋[splitting up] because a box of four匹 [pi] or six匹 [pi], the colors cannot be moved, so non-large households宁愿 [would rather] sell zero. In 89% of the wholesaling goods, after the transaction is completed, the码单 [yards sheet] is first selected, and the goods are shipped after payment. The remittance is based on the market discount (or a full cash statement is made in advance), and there are also those who ship the goods first and then collect the payment, but the truth is very small. After the 码单 [yards sheet] is selected, if it is not cleared within a week, a deposit must be paid. It is noted on the invoice that it will be cleared in half a month or 20 days, otherwise the deposit will be confiscated. On the contrary, if the goods are sold to him, the loss will be compensated by one or two times the amount of the deposit. However, it is very scarce to pay a deposit and not ship or sell it to him (however, if the deposit is not paid, and the market is good or bad, there are often disputes between the two parties.) Recently, it is impossible to pay such a 寂洋 [silent ocean] and ship the goods within the time limit, because the current market situation is changing. If you do not prepay and clear the goods on the same day or within two or three days, you will not be willing to pay for the goods.</p>
<p>(3) Three零匹 [Zero Pi] Goods</p>
<p>Because you can choose the color, the price is about one corner more than the wholesaled ones. The seller sends them to the buyer, and the cartage, no matter how much, is borne by the seller. Whether it is cash or check, or remittance or return receipt, it is stated at the time of sale. The opening price varies according to the type of payment, and naturally it is more cost-effective to trade in cash. For 疋头 [Pitou] goods, those who are shrewd at the buyer's threshold want to re-measure the yards. According to the usual practice, it can be removed if it is less than half a yard in one疋 [pi], and the buyer has to suffer if it is less than half a yard, because according to the rules of the洋行 [foreign firm] for ordering goods, the original疋 [pi] has seals on both ends, and those who are less than half a yard cannot be marked with a fork. Because the零疋 [zero pi] goods are mostly sent to the goods and attached with invoices (the codes are not selected in advance), there are often changes. If the seller encounters goods that are popular and the price rises, there will be a high price and then he will sell them, or there will be a lack of one color and one匹 [pi], or even say that the goods have been preempted, or that the price must be increased by a certain amount (the store number with credit will never do this.) However, the buyer has no evidence and it is difficult to theorize. Turning around, if there is a sudden change of heart, then it is said that the body is bad, the color is slightly different, or the price is cut or the goods are returned. This procedure is not available for 批 [wholesale] the entire box of goods. As the saying goes, "a grain of rice on the mouth, the teeth are buckled to the ground."</p>
<p>(4) Spot Goods</p>
<p>The so-called spot goods, that is, the goods are in the occupied area or in the warehouse, and the delivery is cleared immediately after the transaction (there are also cases where the customer delays for a few days.) 期货 [Forward contract] refers to the goods that have not yet arrived at the port and are sold in advance, stating that they will be delivered in about half a month or a month, and the contract码 [code] is selected first as proof. If there are changes in the market and the contract period is lost, the two parties often have things that they do not keep their word. Therefore, the trade in futures transactions has been quite lacking recently. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e134">Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Dr. Liu Zhanen <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>April 7 this year is the day of Jesus's crucifixion; it is also the anniversary of the martyrdom of Dr. Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai University. Jesus sacrificed for the people of the world, and Dr. Liu sacrificed for the country. Jesus sacrificed his life with the spirit of love. Although Jesus died one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight years ago, people all over the world still commemorate him; Dr. Liu was a believer in Jesus, and he was influenced by Jesus. With the spirit of Bo You [universal love], he managed education and transformed society. Dr. Liu's death is worth commemorating!</p>
<p>Dr. Liu often said three things to people in peacetime, and these three things are what he has been following throughout his life:</p>
<p>The first sentence is to be positive, not negative.</p>
<p>The second sentence is to cooperate, not destroy.</p>
<p>The third sentence is to sacrifice, not benefit oneself.</p>
<p>He also believes that only optimism can overcome pessimism, only observation can overcome negativity, and only Dongguan [Eastern View] can overcome difficulties! Therefore, he always uses a positive spirit and an optimistic attitude to overcome all difficulties in dealing with the world!</p>
<p>We Chinese people lack the ability to organize and lack the spirit of cooperation. When doing something, we are always too focused on the Phoenix and too focused on self-interest; often there are differences of opinion and mutual infighting, which leads to the destruction of things. Dr. Liu saw this and often shouted loudly to warn the people of the country.</p>
<p>Dr. Liu is already dead! But his positive thoughts, cooperative attitude, and spirit of sacrifice will never disappear. Today, we should certainly commemorate him and remember him: we should especially admire him and learn from him.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The Importance and Improvement of Vocational Education for Refugees <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Bujie</p>
<p>The general public in Shanghai who have come from Yi seem to have a very bad impression of refugees. One often hears people saying indignantly: "They eat and sleep, sleep and eat, they don't want to work even when there is work available, they don't want to earn money, and they can't even talk about enduring hardship. The nanny hired from the reception center by a certain mansion ran back after three days. The worker hired by a certain company from the reception center didn't want to work after two days… What is this? Refugees are simply becoming lazy people." Indeed, these are facts, which anyone who cares about the refugee issue can know. The reasons are: First, the staff in the reception centers are too irresponsible. Second, some of them are indeed gluttonous, lazy, and habitually lazy beggars and vagrants mixed in various reception centers. Third, most of the refugees, because they have suffered major disasters, their nerves have been overstimulated, they have lost their inherent rationality, they have no original self-confidence, they have no interest in life, and naturally they can't even talk about work. As a result, they sink into "sleeping and eating, eating and sleeping, not wanting to work even when there is work available, not wanting to earn money…"</p>
<p>Originally, this refugee relief is completely different from the usual charitable undertakings of running nursing homes, disability homes, and relief homes. First, most of the victims this time are good people with jobs and families, the backbone of the country and the nation. Second, this time the war zone is vast and there are many victims. At a time when all these material resources are concentrated on the great cause of resisting the war and building the country, the government certainly does not have huge sums of money to relieve refugees, and donations are inevitably exhausted due to the long war. Third, this destruction is severe and the disaster is serious. Most refugees have lost their fortunes and lost everything. Although current clothing, food, and housing are provided by relief and there are no temporary problems, how to maintain life after the war has become a serious problem. Therefore, this refugee relief is not only to passively supply the refugees with the materials to maintain their lingering lives, even if they have fulfilled their responsibilities, but also to turn passivity into activity, turn laziness into hard work, train the incompetent to have skills, enable the jobless to find employment, and finally enable these refugees who originally relied on others to gradually achieve self-sufficiency and self-reliance, to be useful people for resisting the war and building the country at present, and to be new people who can rely on their own efforts after the war.</p>
<p>How to achieve the above goals? In a word, actively promote vocational education for refugees. Vocational education for refugees is the most important part of refugee relief, and it is also the most fundamental part. If refugee relief ignores vocational education for refugees, it loses the meaning of relief. As a result, although refugees are slightly favored at present, it is not only of no benefit to the country and the nation, but also wastes a bit of power, aggravating the national crisis of resisting the war and building the country at present, and adding a group of lazy vagrants in the future. Only by actively promoting vocational education for refugees can we get to the point of relieving refugees.</p>
<p>In the past year, although the competent authorities of various reception centers in Shanghai also had vocational education facilities for refugees, most of them were perfunctory and did not pay attention to them, and the methods were improper and there was a lack of responsible people, so the results were minimal. The recent criticism of refugees by people in the society is a good proof. The author has been responsible for promoting vocational education for refugees in various reception centers in Shanghai for the past year, and has a lot of knowledge about vocational education for refugees. Now, despite my humble knowledge, I will briefly describe my humble opinions on the points that should be improved in vocational education for refugees in the future:</p>
<p>(1) Consolidate the administrative status and enrich the command power.</p>
<p>In the past, although the competent authorities of various reception centers also had the establishment of vocational education groups and production education groups, their status was low and they existed in name only. Although there were also personnel responsible for promoting it, they had no administrative power and could not issue orders to various reception centers. Therefore, most reception centers adopted a perfunctory attitude towards vocational education for refugees, and various plans and facilities of the superior authorities were often delayed and delayed again, and the results were not achieved after several weeks. For example: to organize a certain production work in a certain reception center, please ask the center to select a number of refugees for training. At first, they agreed readily, but later, they said that the place was too small, or that the wages were too low, or that the refugees were unwilling to learn, and so on. Although the promoters tried their best, the result was still nothing. For this situation, the administrators who bear this responsibility should be given appropriate punishment, either a warning, a demerit, or a dismissal, but because the administrative status of vocational education for refugees itself is low, the promoters certainly have no right to perform this task. Therefore, in the future, vocational education for refugees should establish special departments in the administrative organization of the competent authorities of various reception centers to establish their status, and detailed measures must be formulated to enrich the command power. This is the most important point.</p>
<p>(2) Increase staff and implement division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>The scope of vocational education for refugees is extremely broad, including vocational surveys, vocational introductions, vocational training, vocational guidance, and sales of products. And the content of each job is extremely complex. For example: Vocational training includes procedures such as collecting workers, registering, finding locations, planning funding, and hiring technicians. Another example is vocational introduction, which also includes procedures such as soliciting, registering, and contacting. Since the work of vocational education for refugees is so heavy, it is certainly impossible for one or two people to do everything. However, the competent authorities of various reception centers have made this mistake. Investigation, introduction, training, supervision, and sales are all pushed on the shoulders of one or two promoters. There are so many refugee centers in Shanghai, the places where they are located are so scattered, and the need for vocational education is so urgent. Today, training is organized, tomorrow, introduction is organized, today, we run to the refugee centers, tomorrow, we run to various factories, here and there, this and that, how can one or two people handle it? Children account for only one-tenth or two-tenths of the total number of refugees, but there are dozens of people responsible for promoting education for children, while there are no less than fifty or sixty thousand adult refugees who need vocational education, and only one or two people are responsible for promoting it (taking the International Education Committee of the Red Cross as an example), or even none at all, and other personnel work part-time. How can such a method produce results? Therefore, increasing staff is the current urgent task of promoting vocational education for refugees. Moreover, it is necessary to clearly define and properly allocate who is responsible for what position, and resolutely implement division of labor and cooperation to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(3) Each reception center should establish a special vocational education department and appoint full-time personnel.</p>
<p>In the past, the competent authorities paid little attention to vocational education for refugees, so it had no status in the reception centers, and its organization was mostly subordinate to the management system, without specialized personnel responsible for it. Only a very few reception centers have production managers, but their job is only to collect production commissions every day. Therefore, whenever there is a contact, Zhang San pushes Li Si, and no one is willing to take full responsibility. The promotion of vocational education for refugees certainly depends on the planning and supervision of the competent authorities, but the practical cooperation and serious handling of various reception centers are even more important. Therefore, in the future, each reception center should set up vocational education departments like management, supply, hygiene, and general affairs, and designate specialized personnel to promote it.</p>
<p>(4) Raise fixed funds.</p>
<p>Funding is the mother of a career. With funding, the career can be promoted smoothly and developed rapidly, otherwise, even if the people are good, there will be many difficulties. The refugee reception center itself is a group that is being rescued, and naturally has funding to run various production undertakings. Therefore, the funds for all production undertakings in various reception centers should be planned and managed by the competent authorities in a unified manner. Once this funding is raised, it is not allowed to be used for other purposes, and is specifically used for vocational education facilities for refugees. In the past, various reception centers requested the competent authorities to help because they wanted to run production undertakings, but they often could not be realized because there was no fixed funding, which is a pity.</p>
<p>(5) Conduct more vocational training.</p>
<p>In the past, vocational education for refugees focused on introduction, and training work was rarely organized due to limited funding. However, after "August 13th," various factories and shops closed down, tightened their belts, and there were unemployed people everywhere. Under this situation, it is of course impossible to introduce a large number of jobs to refugees. Therefore, in the past year, less than two-tenths of the hundreds of thousands of refugees have been able to find work. In the future, various training classes must be organized, such as straw weaving training, knitting training, sewing training, barber training, printing worker training, automobile driving and repair, radio transceiver, etc., to train specialized talents and open up employment opportunities. So that they can get production opportunities at present, and have the ability to be self-reliant after the war. It is really a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(6) Contact various parties more.</p>
<p>Vocational education for refugees is not an internal undertaking of the relief agency, but a part of the entire society. It is not only carried out in small reception centers, but also developed to the vast society. If vocational education for refugees is only carried out in circles in the reception centers, it will definitely be difficult to achieve the expected goals. Therefore, it is necessary to contact various parties and conduct it in various ways. In the future, the administrative authorities responsible for promoting vocational education for refugees should initiate the organization of a committee such as the Vocational Education Association for Refugees, contact various industry groups in Shanghai, hold regular meetings, exchange opinions more, and jointly discuss promotion methods, so that it will not be in vain and achieve nothing.</p>
<p>The above is only based on the author's experience in the past year. I offer my humble opinion. Whether it is appropriate, I hope that high-ranking people will correct it!</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Mr. Bu Jie's opinions are very helpful for reference. The Aftercare Department of this Association held a meeting yesterday and discussed the vocational education of refugees for a long time. We were honored to have Mr. Pan Yangrao of the Vocational Education Society and leaders of the industry and commerce circles and journalists in this city to give us advice. We have recorded them and will start implementing them. As for the issue of raising fixed funds, Mr. Xi Yushu, a director of this Association, and others have worked hard for half a month and raised a certain amount, which is stored for future use. If people from all walks of life can give us advice and cooperate with us from time to time, the refugee problem will definitely be properly solved.)</p>
<h3 id="e136">Introducing Refugee Occupations <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Self-reliance</p>
<p>Capable refugees should register.</p>
<p>It is appropriate for those who have been affected by the war and whose family property has been reduced to ashes and who have no way to make a living to live in reception centers as refugees and to be supported by charitable organizations. If there is no food, rice will be sent. If there is no clothing, clothes will be sent. Although it is not eating well and wearing well, it can always be said that there is no worry about freezing and starvation. However, the refugees in Shanghai should also think about where the food and clothing you eat and wear come from? Do they fall from the sky? Of course not. Everything you use is donated by enthusiastic people in the society. Now, there are many people who run around and solicit donations for you every day. There are many people who save expenses for you and plan to help you through savings methods. There are many people who take a commission on the operation to help you, and even many elementary school students are saving their candy expenses for you. Think about it, how precious is the sympathy of these people! They spend money, on the one hand, to maintain your lives, and on the other hand, they also want you to be able to stand on your own from a life of suffering, so as to reduce the burden on the country and society, and work together to seek welfare for the society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Aftercare Department of the Refugee Relief Association will follow this idea to handle the aftercare affairs of refugees. Refugees who need to work can be introduced to occupations. The Aftercare Department is working on all kinds of things that can solve the refugee problem. Refugees should listen to it.</p>
<p>Now I will tell you about the vocational introduction methods of the Aftercare Department so that you can consider them.</p>
<p>(1) In order to improve the work efficiency of introducing refugee occupations, a vocational introduction group (hereinafter referred to as this group) is specially established in the Aftercare Department to handle refugee vocational introduction matters.</p>
<p>(2) The work of this group is listed as follows: (1) Registration, (2) Investigation, (3) Assessment, (4) Guidance, (5) Introduction, (6) Statistics, (7) Other related matters.</p>
<p>(3) In order to understand the work skills and employment needs of refugees, this group may establish registration offices in various reception centers or other appropriate locations. All refugees who request vocational introduction must first fill in the "Job Application Registration Form." Then, this group will send personnel to various reception centers to conduct on-site investigations when necessary to prevent fraud.</p>
<p>(4) This group should carefully assess the skills of job-seeking refugees before introduction to avoid incompetence and being dismissed. The standards and methods of assessment will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>(5) For refugees who have passed the assessment, in addition to being advertised in newspapers or letters to various industries and businesses to employ them as much as possible, this association will also publish the "Vocational Introduction Column of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association" in various newspapers, summarizing their number, skills, desired type of work, and desired treatment.</p>
<p>(6) When there is a need for job-seeking refugees, this group will introduce them separately. If the introduction is successful, this group should give practical guidance on the matters to be paid attention to when employed, and ask them to fill out two copies of the "Volunteer Form." Paste a photo on the Volunteer Form, one copy to be kept by this association and one copy to be given to the employer.</p>
<p>(7) For refugees who are introduced to work by this association, a probationary period of one to three months is temporarily set. During the probationary period, the employer only provides meals or board and lodging, and does not pay wages.</p>
<p>(8) In order to encourage refugees to find employment, this association may provide transportation subsidies to refugees introduced by this association during the probationary period, up to one yuan per person per month.</p>
<p>(9) Refugees who are introduced to work by this association and whose wages are sufficient to maintain the entire life of their families should be ordered to move out of the reception center. Those who can only maintain part of their families should also be classified as self-sufficient reception centers and live separately from other refugees.</p>
<p>(10) Refugees who are introduced to occupations and refuse to work without legitimate reasons, or who abandon themselves after being introduced to work, resulting in dismissal, or who voluntarily quit without legitimate reasons, should be expelled from the center by this association, and all reception centers should be notified to refuse to accommodate them. Those who have left the center because they have found employment will no longer be accommodated.</p>

<p>— Refugee Reporter</p>
<p>I am a refugee, we are all refugees.</p>
<p>In the past, we were clerks in the pawnshops of our uncles on our mother's side, in the shops of our uncles, and in the stacks of our cousins.</p>
<p>When there was something to do, we dealt with it lazily and perfunctorily; when there was nothing to do, we talked and chatted. Not visiting prostitutes or gambling was already a decent person.</p>
<p>I regret it very much. At that time, I had the brains but did not study, and I had the hands and feet but did not work. I only knew how to live a leisurely life.</p>
<p>When the gunfire rang, the pawnshops, shops, and machine rooms of our relatives closed their doors, leaving us, the incompetent and unlearned, with no way to eat.</p>
<p>Now, we have learned a profound lesson: "A person should rely on himself, and only himself is the most reliable."</p>

<p>— Wei Hua</p>
<p>My body is big,</p>
<p>My age is high;</p>
<p>The gale shakes my head for me,</p>
<p>The torrential rain washes me.</p>
<p>In spring, I put on a green hat,</p>
<p>In winter, I am more vigorous in the frost,</p>
<p>In summer and autumn, the scorching sun is as red as fire,</p>
<p>It is good to be carefree under the shade of the tree.</p>
<p>Farmers and woodcutters talk and laugh,</p>
<p>Children jump and run together.</p>
<p>They all say to me:</p>
<p>"Only big trees are really good!"</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year before last,</p>
<p>Savages came together.</p>
<p>Without asking east or west,</p>
<p>They recklessly chopped down my branches.</p>
<p>Although my body is big and I am not afraid of chopping,</p>
<p>The anger in my heart is burning like fire.</p>
<p>I said: "You come and chop!</p>
<p>Next year I will definitely be more vigorous,</p>
<p>You chop one branch and ten branches will grow.</p>

<p>— Wu Guang</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi</p>
<p>The battles this week were all fierce. The Japanese army exhausted its naval, land, and air forces, and launched fierce attacks in several directions. However, the entire Chinese army, under the command of the Supreme Commander, fought bravely to resist. The losses given to the Japanese army in the past week were truly great. The efficiency of the attrition warfare was brought into full play. According to Japanese news, the war in northern Jiangxi has never been seen since the Battle of Wuhan. It was found that since the Japanese army attacked Duchang and Wucheng on both sides of Poyang Lake last week, its fierce offensive was frustrated after being countered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army then continued its strategic battle, sending tens of thousands of troops to attack Wuning and Nanchang. The Japanese army attacking Wuning advanced from Ruoxi in two routes, one route westward and one route southward. The Chinese army counterattacked and bravely attacked the Japanese army on Hushan Changgang. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly from a high position. After a fierce battle, the Japanese line collapsed and fled towards Wuning. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and approached the Wuning city wall. The Japanese army attacking Nanchang, at first, in Gouziling, Manshoushan, Fengxin area, fought bravely with the Chinese army against fierce artillery fire and poison gas, and more than 2,000 Japanese officers and soldiers below the captain of the Iino Regiment were killed. In the Battle of Fengxin, the Miyazaki Regiment Commander also died one after another. However, the losses on the Chinese side were also considerable. According to reports a few days ago, the Japanese army has advanced and occupied Nanchang. The Chinese side, in order to continue its task of attrition warfare, has shifted its front and continued to launch the war, so it launched a full-scale counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army in Nanchang has always been blocked north of Liantang and has made no progress. In the Gaoan area, the Chinese and Japanese armies launched bloody battles in Zhanggu Fuxiangguan Shanzili and other places one after another. The Japanese army suffered considerable losses under the fierce artillery fire of the Chinese side. As of the morning of the 3rd, it had not subsided. The Chinese side has moved into a self-serving area because the task of attrition has been achieved.</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>There have been no changes along the Yuehan, Guangjiu, and Guangshen lines. More than 2,000 Japanese troops attacking Shaping from Jiujiang, more than 20 tanks, and airplanes and poison gas were added. The Japanese unit commander, Zhishi Songdi, personally commanded. The momentum was very fierce. The Chinese army fought fiercely with them in Huangsaikeng and Zhuangyuanshan. At the same time, the Japanese army landed from Beijie and attacked Jiangmen from two routes, attempting to realize the plan to break through Zhongshan. According to reports, Shaping, Beijie, and Jiangmen were once lost. Later, Hua Cheng launched a large-scale counterattack with the spirit of certain death, and completely repelled the Japanese army. Only more than 100 Japanese troops fled to Jiujiang. The remnants are still being mopped up. The Japanese warships on the Fangcheng Sea in the south once used air firepower to cover the landing in Qisha, but they failed to succeed after being fiercely swept by the Chinese garrison. Now the sea is calm and nothing is happening. Also, hundreds of Japanese troops in Ding'an, Hainan Island, equipped with many tanks, advanced from Leiming City to Yidi, and also encountered fierce fighting from the Chinese side. The Japanese army was unable to support it and finally collapsed towards Stability. The Chinese army also tracked and entered Leiming City.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the Anyi, Yuncheng, and Yongji areas of southern Shanxi launched fierce attacks on the Zhongtiao Mountain positions in several routes this week. One route of more than 2,000 Japanese troops advanced towards Dachen Village, one route of more than 2,000 Japanese troops attacked Monanzhen, and another route of more than 1,000 Japanese troops attacked Nanwei Village. Each route had Japanese aircraft to assist in the battle, attempting to spy on the important strongholds of Maojindu and Pinglu, which was very active. The Chinese army relied on the favorable terrain to launch fierce counterattacks, fighting back and forth, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented in that area. Dachen Village, Monanzhen, and Nanwei Village were lost and regained several times. In the end, due to the brave and bloody battles of the Chinese side, the areas were still held by China. In this battle, the Japanese side lost more than 1,000 people and shot down one Japanese plane. The main force of the Japanese army has been hit, so the momentum in Maojindu Pinglu and other places is even stronger.</p>
