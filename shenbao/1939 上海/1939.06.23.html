<h3>重兵開到向日反攻　華軍仍對守汕頭市區　日方要求第三國軍艦限期撤退　英美已予拒絕僑民亦全離汕　張發奎囂令所部堵擊進犯日軍</h3>
<p>潮安　截止今午十一時、華軍仍堅守汕頭市區、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>（香港）外訊、汕市昨午發生激烈巷戰後、日兵一隊進犯汕東崎碌砲台、另一隊則謀向汕北庵埠推進英當局準備兩輸、今下午載英僑婦孺離汕、英方此舉、係因華軍在汕市四週佈置重兵、凖備向日軍反攻、泊汕英艦達納特號暫不撤、史葛特號已駛抵韓江河口、（廿二日專電）</p>
<p>潮安　二十二日晨、華方以汕北四十華里之庵埠、無險可守、遂自動退守西北方預定防綫、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>潮安　據前方電話、汕市截至二十二日上午六時、仍混戰中、華軍在市東北區據守各建築物、以機槍向日軍掃射、斃日軍甚衆、日機四十餘架、分十二批輪　轟炸、至夜九時、仍在市區盤旋投彈、足證日方播謂下午二時完全佔有汕市之說、爲欺騙日方民衆之宣傳、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>潮安　犯汕頭之日軍遭華軍痛撃、數决增援、與華激戰、迄至今晨、日華仍在東郊飛機塲一帶激戰中、廿一晚潮（安）汕（頭）電話仍通、（廿二日電）</p>
<p>（香港）興寗訊、汕頭華軍昨晨至午迭創來犯之日軍、的斃日軍四百餘人、現華軍政當局集某地、指揮各兵繼續作戰、汕市昨大火竟日未熄、在北港登陸日軍圖犯潮安、張發奎已下令、不得予日軍以深入機會、（二十二日專電）</p>
<p>（香港）據確息、美已拒絕日之無理要求、決不撤退泊汕戰艦、並增派教主號艦赴汕、保護僑民、現旅汕美僑四十餘人、政府對撤退僑民一舉、尚未有所決定云、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據今日此間消息、日方限令英艦離開汕頭之哀的美敦書、已爲英國駐華艦隊所拒絕、政府對於英國遠東海軍此一步驟、準備立卽予以支持、聞英政府對於天津與汕頭方面之發展、已與華盛頓商議聯合對付之辦法、英國海軍大臣史丹賀認日方之哀的美敦書、性質極爲嚴重、且具有極大之政治意義、故請首相外相從速討論應付辦法、又美國遠東艦隊司令雅納爾、對於日方哀的美頓書率直拒絕一事、頗使美國之態度爲之增强、英國海軍界認日本絕無命令他國船隻離開中國海之權力、故對於日方之態度極爲憤慨、（二十二日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）外傳日本海軍當局、已向各國當局提出哀的美頓書、要求各該國軍艦包括美國驅逐艦「畢爾斯堡萊」號在內、須在本月二十二日午後一時之前、離開中國汕頭港、國務院海軍部各官員、均謂並無所知云、（廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（汕頭）汕頭港內現泊有日驅逐艦七艘、媽嶼已於昨日午後六時半失陷、有日機多架飛城投彈、並開機槍掃射、該城仍在華軍手中、汕頭外僑均安、（二十二日路透電）　　（東京）此間今日接香港電訊、謂華軍刻由內地向汕頭移動、企圖遏阻日軍之前進、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於日軍佔據中國汕頭港事、外傳日本海軍當局、曾要求各國艦船離開該處、其詳如何、尚無所知、但該國若確有此種要求、英國決當予以拒絕、各報所傳、該處英國軍艦、業已拒絕此項要求之訊、定屬可靠云、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於日本要求英美戰艦於今日一時離開汕頭一事、此間人士認爲英美當局、未必予以接受、倫敦各報對日本要求、視爲哀的美敦書、逆料其結果或將引起遠東局勢之驚人變化、英國海軍部現時尚未接到香港官方之報告、但從各方情勢觀察、英美兵艦幷無撤退之意、據中立觀察家所得印像、倫敦顯然認爲日本通牒、係挑戰行爲、同時爲破壞中英間條的之行動、蓋汕頭關爲商埠、乃按照一八五八年天津條的所規定也、（二十二日海通社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據接近海軍部人士宣稱、現在天津之美國東亞艦隊總司令雅里爾上將、已經拒絕日方自汕頭撤退美國驅逐艦「皮爾斯蓓萊」號之要求、同時對於日方請求撤退汕頭美僑一事、亦加以拒絕、（二十二日海通社電）</p>
<h3>日軍炸飛機塲雙方有爭奪戰</h3>
<p>潮安　犯汕日軍係先以陸戰隊數百名、於二十一日晨五時、在潮陽屬達濠以束之東湖及四基澳頭等地方登陸、分路西犯、華守軍奮起迎擊、在沿海村落問發生激戰、同時日艦三十餘艘、配備汽艇數十隻、窺馬屛口、開砲向兩岸亂轟、華守軍亦予迎撃、十時許、日艇在軍艦砲火及飛機掩護下、衝破封鎖錢、隨卽有兩艦掩護數十汽艇、駛近汕市海岸、華守軍猛予射擊、當塲撃沉日艇十餘隻、斃日軍百餘名、日軍以無法登陸、另派穿着黑衣之便衣隊三百餘名、繞道在飛機塲登陸、並派飛機輸迥投彈、遂由機塲轉入街巷戰、華軍據守市街、屹然應戰、復源源增援、戰至下午六時、華軍仍堅守未退、最先犯潮陽海岸日軍遭華方痛擊、於下午五時許曾一度潰退、（二十二日電）</p>
<h3>汕頭人口疏散數月前已辦理</h3>
<p>（重慶）據華方發言人今日聲稱、汕頭平民物質之疏散撤退、在數月前已由軍事當局下令發動、故日軍之進犯、早在意料之中、又謂華軍在汕頭後背之叢山地帶、及韓江一帶早已佈有防禦工事、以備日軍之進犯、又謂、前時汕頭英美法各敎會曾詛担任難民營設立、華方以日人對於難民收容所之安全、向不遵守信誓、南京廣州漢口以及其他各地之事實、可爲前車之鑒、故未許設立、而專從人口之疏散着手、最後該發言人稱、汕頭之失至多爲華方喪失一商埠、至於日軍欲深入、事實上因地勢關係、及防禦工事之早有布置、故決不可能也、（十二日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>有田通知各國日軍侵汕行動</h3>
<p>（東京）日外相有田昨以在汕頭開始新軍事行動事通知外國外交代表、聞諸日方人士、有田之照會中宣稱、此决行動「無他意、僅欲擴大純粹的軍事活動、志在摧毀中政府用以作戰之重要根據地耳、」聞有田已向外國外交代表保證日政府所行尊重第三國在華權益之政策、依然未變、目前戰事中將竭力防杜對第三國權益有何毀壞、希望外國政府與在華外國當局完全明瞭日政府之政策、而對於防杜一切不幸事件之可能性、特別加以注意、望請外國當局與日軍合作、以防杜毀壞外國利益、或至少使此種毀壞减加以注意、希望外國政府對於中政府圖使彼等牽涉於中日戰爭之「陰謀」採取一切可能的防範、照會末、請外國外交代表憶及去歲十月十二日前任首相近衛所致彼等關於防杜目前戰事中不幸事件之照會、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日海部發言人金澤少將、今日語各外籍記者云、日軍佔據汕頭之結果、不致引起國際間之紅紛、因事先已確知第三國財產之地點、日軍對之已時加小心云、某記者發問、謂日方何以遲至今日始佔據汕頭、金澤答稱、此事純因軍略上之原因、並指出日軍在大陸開始軍事行動時、有調用大批軍隊之必要、（二十二路透社電）</p>
<h3>日方攫佔汕頭係援助津事件</h3>
<p>（重慶）此間報紙批評日軍在汕頭登陸稱、日軍攫佔汕頭動機之一、乃希望援助其在天津之行動、廣州陷落後、汕頭因地理上之位置、隨日可遭日軍進犯、此决登陸、顯係乘時援助日本在天津之反英運動、汕頭距香港一百八十八海里、故日軍侵佔之、得有甚甚重要之海空軍根據地、而威脅香港及香港與馬尼刺之交通、（二十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>現行金融制度之限制</h3>
<p>自八一三戰後限制付現以來，昨又爲二决之限制。其辦法所不同於第一决者，前爲每星期照存額可支百分之五之現鈔，此决則每星期付現五百元爲限，前以百分率計算者，存欵愈多，所可支取之現鈔愈鉅，仍不足以收限制現鈔流通之效，且至多經過二十星期後，仍可全部支現，惟儲蓄存戶額在千數百元者，，一時不無受其影響。（其後准三百元以下存戶不受此限制）今則大多數之小存戶可無此苦痛，即就大存戶言之，每週五百，即每月二千元，得此現鈔亦可應付其生活。至於俸給階級，可不受限制，照數付現。最困難者，莫如工商業。析言之：工商業往來雖亦收受匯劃票據，而自有其限制，滙劃若干成，現鈔若干成，一也。或則付滙劃與付劃頭者從價額分軒輊，二也。即此二者，旣使工商業遭受嚴重打擊；况有更甚於此者，即各業若以正當之需要，須購外國原料，將以五百元之限制而無法維持其生產是也。至於洋商方面，即小至付房租水電雜費，非現鈔不行、於是滙劃遂不能通用，但一經貼現之後，盈千累萬之現鈔又可立得。質言之，限制付現，推行匯劃，徒爲銀錢業或投機商，從滙劃與現鈔間闢一牟利之蹊徑耳。且因提現之有限制，使擁有大宗存欵之金融界，無所用其巨額準備，勢將驅之以套買外滙，囤積商品，又因大宗現鈔依然可用貼現覓得，易成外匯，於是不必需之洋貨源源而來，大宗金錢滔滔而逝，即爲人所吸收以去者亦無法加以防範。循是言之，行將造成外滙損耗投機在熱物價飛漲生活艱難之結果，是大可注意者也。</p>
<p>限制提現之用意，必爲防範外滙走漏資金逃避起見，即現鈔可以買外滙，限制現鈔之流通，即所以限制外滙之買賣，但匯劃既可貼現，則外匯仍可購得，此其一。限制提現，僅以限制上海租界內存於銀行中之存欵耳，若彼流通於淪陷區內之法幣，轉不以限制提現而受任何影響，更恐因是而反促其吸收，此其二。洋商不收匯劃，不但貨欵無法應付，即一般生活費如水電房租捐稅之與洋商有關係者、莫不需要現鈔，遂使法幣逐漸移轉於洋商，匯劃則削弱其效用、，此其三。中國工商業因近來匯劃之用途漸少，需用現鈔者漸多，而劃頭之存於銀行者，亦同樣限制不能照額支取法幣；試問其如有應付於洋商之貨欵，從何覓取外匯，是則限制提現辦法，尚不能得其所期望之效用，先已予工商界以不便，此其四。</p>
<p>故中國政府如有決心改善金融機構也，則應　對於工商業正當必需之外匯，如何照法定匯率，爲適量之供給。　旣經核准供給之後，應付之匯價，不問其爲匯劃爲現鈔，同樣可用，不限於提供現鈔。則貼現之風不禁而自絕。　滙市塲上自由買賣不予供給。然此有關於權力之行使，及宅心公正，能以整個中國工商金融事業利害爲前提，無有絲毫人我得失之見於其中，而後可卜成效之立覩也。</p>
<p>如中國政府限制提現辦法止於此，而無下文以爲補救，則其必然之結果，工商界爲資金呆凍亟於週轉起見，則不論貼現率高昂至如何地步，將盡量易取法幣，購得黑市塲之外滙，以策其安全而應付其債務。其决爲現鈔不易取得，勢不得不專收現鈔，拒用滙劃，此則匯劃之用途愈狹，市面之杌隍愈甚，或曰，正欲其如此耳，而不知應分別事業之性質，爲相當之維持，吾則皂白不分。同歸於盡，工商業之失敗何足惜，其如中國之元氣何。况資金之逃避，恐不能以目前限制提現，盡收宏效，蓋擁有大宗資財者，早已作逃避之計。惟吾人對於中國政府此决措施，不能不謂爲具有苦心，至少之作用，或可戢投機之風，收緊縮之效，而抑制漲無止境之物價，然亦應顧及一般工商業之困難，務求有以善其後也。</p>
<h3>英法軍艦留汕保護外僑利益</h3>
<p>（香港）日海軍當局已要求所有第三國之船隻、包括軍艦在內、一律於今日下午一時之前、由汕頭港內撤退、目下英輸穎州及潑羅米能兩艘、正從事撤退、英僑婦孺及他國僑民之願離汕者、二輸均定今日午後啟程、因華軍反攻、市內恐有激戰也、現駐汕頭之外艦、有英艦桑那特號及美驅逐艦披爾斯白雷號、據聞桑那特已決定留駐汕頭、蓋英海軍當局已宣布該艦將留汕照料英僑之利益、聞披爾斯白雷號亦將留駐汕頭、又據可恃方面消息、美驅迷艦阿須維爾號擬於明日開汕、英驅逐艦斯高特號、現泊汕頭港外、如有必要時、凖備與桑那特號聯合保謎英國利益、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>法報論日舉動具有警告性質</h3>
<p>（巴黎）日軍在汕頭港登陸事、此間各晨報均在封面版用大字標題、予以登載、皆謂該港乃中國通往外方碩果僅存之港口、右派日報載稱、日本方面企圖控制中國各港口、以阻止中國政府獲得接濟、原屬理所當然、但日本軍事當局適在天津事件緊張、該國兵力宜集不宜分散之時、亦卽美國對於日本在鼓浪嶼行動提出强硬抗議之後、復在汕頭港登陸、此則未免可異、「此事縱可謂與外國租界無涉、日軍所佔據者、僅爲純粹中國港口、實在國際利益、仍受直接妨害、日方促使各國協力抵抗、此乃最佳方法、」或謂此决舉動、乃所以饜足日本軍部、俾對於天津事件之成立折衷方案、不事阻撓、耍之、日軍適在英法兩國軍事當局在新加坡港舉行會議之前夕、佔據汕頭港、「此事具有警告性質、實昭然若揭、」小日報載稱、日方茲乘歐洲各國不和之際、銳意侵蝕中國、其在中國通往外方之最後一港登陸、自無足怪、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>保護津僑民利益　英將採必要措置　外相電達津英總領　英國態度轉趨强硬　日方或能接受建議</h3>
<p>（倫敦）關於日軍封鎖天津英租界事、哈里法克斯外相昨曾致電該處英國總領事贾美森、內開、政府決當採取必耍措置、以保護僑民利益、並從速解決此項糾紛、請將此意、慰示各僑民云云、賈美森總領事當卽覆電、表示感謝、並謂全體僑民聞訊之餘、咸甚感奮云、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨據此間官方人士宣稱、英國雖極願視天津之現局爲地方上之糾紛、惟以爲日方目前所採用之方法、如繼續不已、則結果必難免引起英國之對抗手段、以保護其權益、此種局勢、決不能任其長此無限繼續云、衆料首相張伯倫將於今日下午在下院陳述天津局勢、同時又據官方消息、天津租界邊境之通行限制、並未稍見寬弛、英人之企國越過租界者、常須久候、並遭嚴厲之檢查、且有脫去一部份衣服者、法租界當局以軍用卡車運入物品、似已獲得日常所需之接濟、（廿二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於天津市局勢、此間官方人士、頃於今晨宣稱、日軍封鎖之舉、若果長此下去、英國決當採取報復手段、英國雖望此事、能就地解決、但若此項希望、竟歸泡影、則英國態度、卽當趨於强硬、而以適當辦法、應付現行局勢、此乃日本方面所應了解者、此外張伯倫首相定於本日午後、在下議院發表聲明、各方均引領以待、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（新嘉坡）此間報載有英軍一大隊、現已整裝待發、開往上海方面云云、已經此間英軍當局吾認、唯於華北局勢惡化時、此問駐軍準備隨時開往中國一層、英方並不否認、（二十二日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>英首相在下院報告</h3>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫、今日在下院報告日本封鎖天津英租界之最近發展時、謂該處出入租界之限制仍無變更、若干英僑通過障碍物時、須經長時間之等待、及嚴厲之搜查、現有充分新鮮食物、經多時之躭擱後、已輸入英租界、往日屆此酷暑、英租界內之外籍婦孺大半皆離津赴海濱逭暑、現正設法使彼等早日成行、聞第一批已啟程、英艦散特維區號、已於六月二十日抵津、本擬調防之英艦洛維斯托夫號、目下亦暫時留駐天津、華南方面、日本海陸軍隊已於六月二十一日黎明、在汕頭附近登陸、現已設法撤退該地婦孺、所需之輸船、業已開往該處、日海軍當局、已允便利此項撒退、並會重英國之財產、英船桑那特號、現已開抵汕頭、考特號今日亦可抵汕、鼓浪嶼之食物情形、愈見惡化、厦門及大陸方面之接濟均己中斷、惟目下以第三國船隻運入食物、當無困難、反對黨代理領袖格林武起立發問、謂鑒於目下迭决發生之侵略行動、雖未必皆係對英國而發、不知首相其擬取較强硬之行動、以表示英政府對於日政府之容忍此項侵略行爲、深戚不快乎、首相作答時、保證政府對於格氏所述及之各種行爲、已予以甚大之關切、並謂天津之封鎖事件、情勢至形嚴重、吾人當然仍望或有藉談判以解決此地方事件之可能、惟此項談判如遭失敗、吾人自將考慮繼續應取之步驟、保守黨議員密爾納問、日本所傳克萊琪爵士曾於兩三日前向有田「乞憐」之消息、首相其知之否、首相其願對此荒謬之說確切聲明無一言可信吾否、首相答曰、就其表面而論、當然願意出此、此說一望卽可知其荒誕無稽、實則絕未有之、工黨議員諾爾巴克起稱、首相所言者、爲天津事件之地方問題、實則此事已日見顯明共爲反對在華外人權利之侵略行爲、並或將成爲獨覇遠東之企圖也、首相答曰、「余希望其不然、倘使果不幸而言中、則將極爲嚴重」云、至是至是議長乃發言阻止再提任何問話、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日在測騐英國能力</h3>
<p>（重慶）據此間熟悉時事之華方稱、此次日方封鎖天津、若獲得若干勝利、則必使日本政府中之軍閥勢力、更見高漲、而削弱企圖獲取英法美援助之自由派之力量、又謂、日閥發動天津事件、目的純在測騐英國有無保衛其遠東權益之決心、日本軍閥若能證明英國並無採取報復行動之膽力、並無爲其遠東利益而戰之決心、則彼等在國內方面卽能獲得勝利、至此、日本軍閥卽可進而發動其驅逐英人出遠東之計劃、或將不顧租界之中立地位而佔領租界、上海租界、屆時恐亦難倖免、第二種結果、或將使日本逕行加入德義之軍事同盟、此爲日本溫和派失勢之可能結果、（此輩溫和派固竭力反對日本之加入德義軍事同盟者、其理由卽爲日本一加入德義軍事同盟之後、卽將斷送第三國調停中日戰事之機會也、）但假若今决英人對于天津問題、表示軟弱、則日本軍閥卽將認英國無對日報復與日作戰之決心、故必進而驅逐第三國在華之利益、至少亦將逼迫英國放棄其對於中國貨幣以及其他方面之支持、吾則卽將實行驅逐英人在遠東方面之全般利益、又謂、目前英蘇談判之尙無成議、使日閥深信和平陣錢不致推及遠東、此爲日閥所萬分欣幸者、且就日本軍閥觀察、不獨和平陣綫不致推及遠束、同時歐洲方面亦甚少成功之希望、故彼輩之意、英蘇關係必能疏遠、柏林羅馬軸心、必能加强、本年九月間歐戰卽可發生、屆時對日本卽可以武力强迫英國放棄其對於中國之援助而承認日本之所謂「東亞新秩序」也、最後，該熟識時事之方面稱、英國今决對日決不能采取妥靖政策、蓋若採取此種政策、必將使日閥深信英國無確保其權益之意思也，爲英國計、必須對日本採取强硬堅決之態度、同時更須將和平陣綫推至遠東方面、始能有濟於事實（二十二日美聯社電）</p>

<p>銀錢兩業　通告遵辦</p>
<p>銀錢兩業公會於前日上午九時、先接宋子文·錢新之·葉琢堂。聯名之私人電報、謂爲防止上海之競購外滙、而免資金之逃避、財政部正考慮辦法、望靜候部電辦理、及至是日下午十二時、始得財政部馬電、當於昨　二時、召集緊急會賺、除　決遵辦辦外、並召開銀錢業大會、集　一切、茲錄其通告云、「逕啟者、刻奉財政部馬電（中略見部電）、本會各會員行莊、　　照辦理、除八一三以前存款、仍照安定金融　法外、特此通告、務希查照辦現爲要、</p>
<p>前定辦法　繼續有效</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀錢業檀溪、財部二十六年八月十六日公佈之安定金融辦法、及二十六年八月十七日部批之安定金融補充辦法、今仍繼續有效、即八月十六日起之各種活期存款、及到期之定期存款、如須向原存行莊支取者、每戶每星期祗能照其存款餘額、提取百分之五、但每存戶每星期至多以提取法幣一百五十元、銀錢業同業所出本票、一律加蓋同業匯劃戳記、此項票據、祇准上海同業滙劃不付法幣及轉購外滙</p>

<p>謠言平息　人心已安</p>
<p>某金融領袖昨封往訪之新聲社記者稱、財政部馬電限制支付存款辦法、旨在防止資金之逃避、係政府整個戰時金融政策之一、凡　國民、自當一致奉行、今上海之各銀行錢莊、均已奉令遵辦存戶之提存、反較前减少、金融市塲、益趨穩定、外滙黑市因投機者缺乏法幣、中止扒進黑市外滙、以致價格放長、匯劃貼水、雖已無市、但係暫時性質、望市民鎭靜、切勿憂慮、市塲謠言、昨日午後起、已完全平息、人心亦安、</p>
<p>黑市外滙　昨稍轉鬆</p>
<p>外滙黑市、自經英商滙豐銀行繼續儘量供給後、市塲價格、已趨穩定、英滙爲六便士半、美滙十二元六二五、似已到所謂之新水平綫、昨日黑市外匯、滙豐銀行掛牌、照舊未動、因財政部限制提存、致市上現鈔頭寸、益感枯竭、一般人對外滙之購　買力、頓告薄關、滙率轉鬆、英匯放長六便士八七五、美滙　　長至十二元八七五、午後市塲突告回縮、但較星期二之行市、仍見轉鬆、關於中央銀行法定外滙價格、依然穩定如恒、</p>
<p>證券狂跌　暫行停市</p>
<p>證券暗市、前因傳統一各依停付本息、以致價格在跌、前日因端節休假、昨晨照常開拍、市塲謠言未息、人心浮動、且因財政部限制提存、以致價格續跌、上午收盤統一甲種五十四元二角、跌二元九角、乙種四十七元、跌二元四角、丙種四十六元三角、跌二元二角、丁種四十五元七角、跌一元一角、戊種四十五元五角、跌二元四角、下午因交割未淸、暫行停市、同時決定明（二十三）後（二十四日）停市、待下星期一（二十六日）各經紀人開會後、再行決定開市日期、</p>
<p>金市已趨　停頓狀態</p>
<p>現金暗盤集議日起因幣頓告缺乏、各投機金市者、無法幣購進進現金而持現金者、亦無從脫手、所以交易毫無、已　　停頓狀態、但有非正式之交易、價爲二千五百元、較上星期二舉跌一百六十九元之　、至於銀樓　牌、昨日　舊未動、大同行兌出價爲二百七十元、新同行兌出價爲二百六十八兀、惟收進價須减低十五元至二十元不等、</p>
<p>滙劃貼水昨日無市</p>
<p>自上海實行滙劃票據制度之後、造成滙劃掉換法幣貼水、經營者爲一般小錢莊、凡正式銀行及滙劃莊、均拒不營此貼水、前因投機者之操縱、致貼水率飛漲、上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、曾受中中交三行之委託、出而平準滙劃貼水率、於是市塲貼水率、始告穩定、站在每千元貼水五十元左右、自財部昨日起限制提存後、鈔票頭寸市塲、異常缺乏、於是各錢兌莊及準備委會竟無行市、但有某錢兌莊以以七十五元之貼水、收進</p>
<p>各業集議設法開市</p>
<p>（一）紗布暗市昨日通告暫行停市、俟銀錢業決定補救辦法後、再行開市、（二）雜糧交易暗市、昨日亦暫停市、雜糧油餅業公會、於昨日下午五時集議補救辦法（三）麵粉交易昨日現鈔二號標準粉爲四元六角半、滙劃交易停頓、（四）米業昨日亦會開會提出研究、青蓮閣市塲、今日照常開市、叉據新聲社記者探悉、雜糧麵粉紗布等市塲、因銀錢兩業、已決定辦法七項、一切付款辦法、已告解決、聞今日起，即可照常開市、</p>
<p>華興銀行　遭受打擊</p>
<p>僞「維新政府」爲擾亂中國金融、經於上月十五日在滬成立「華興銀行」、發行僞幣二千萬元、至該項資本、則以法幣爲準備、但自成立以後、因各方不予信任、故並無若何發展、所有僞幣、僅在虹口·閘北·等日軍佔領區域、强迫使用、自財部新定限制提存辦法後、大量法幣、乃無從獲得、僞「華興銀行」之準備基金、已發生動搖、該行前途、將蒙受重大打擊、</p>
<p>日商無法　套購外滙</p>
<p>大光社記者昨晨曾分訪工商業領袖、叩詢對於財部新措置後所發生之後果、據表示、自財部實施是項緊急措置後、各業對鉅額法幣、即無法取得、亦即無從購辦外貨、是故在滬日商之大量日貨、即無法脫售、以易取法幣、套購外匯、故今後日貨在華、必大量激减、至於內地土產、則因商人無法購辦外貨、將多改辦土貨、故銷路勢必更形暢旺、此於整個國家工商業、倶有莫大之利益、惟當此新令初行之時、商人或有稍感不便、但匯劃運用廣泛後、正復與法幣相同、各業自無庸隱憂也、</p>
<p>金融益穩物價將跌</p>
<p>又據某經濟專家稱、財部馬日電令、確係穩定戰時經濟之必要措置、凡屬國人、自應一致奉行、而無庸加以絲毫之猜疑、蓋此舉足以舫止資金逃避、而使金融益臻穩定也、又滬市物價飛漲、經此項新令措置後、亦將有可能的回跌、是則對於一般平民生活、將更獲裨益、</p>

<p>離津渡輸　備遭留難</p>
<p>諸旅客係上星期五日午後十二時三十分乘渡輪離英租界河濱、循河下駛至塘沽、轉登德生輸、日兵曾一度攔阻該渡輸、但檢閱護照數紙、略加盤詰後、即准渡輪繼續前駛、被阻延遲共的一小時、午後六時三十分抵海岸、乃登德生輪而於决日午後一時啟程來滬、</p>
<p>天津局勢難望進展</p>
<p>德生輪　　未與日兵發生事件、惟會於星期二日遭遇風浪、致延遲六小時始抵滬、據記者所晤大多數抵滬者之意見、最近將來津局似不致有進展某婦稱、實不耐留居津地、該童確切表示、不滿日軍之行動云、</p>

<p>無不尊重外交上之特免權、僅不必舉其名之東方某國除外而已、此外從外國寄來之郵件、亦遭截留、去年八月號之美國讀者彙刊因轉載賽珍珠所著謂中國卒能戰勝之一文、而有數百冊遭沒收、駐滬美海軍陸戰隊定購之「美國海軍陸戰團歷史」一書、亦遭日籍檢查員竊去、尚有芝加哥賴斯惠爾敎援所著論述</p>
<p>宣傳技巧</p>
<p>等書、均遭沒收、或疑檢查員此種行爲、其動機非僅希望外人不獲與日方觀察點相背之觀念而已、當證明附有款項之函件亦遺失後、益信所疑無誤、有識見之人決不以耍函託上海郵局寄遞、而改由輸船直接送來、或由私人携往香港付郵、蓋免遭日人檢查也、外國領事官員曾提出强硬抗議、反對此種濫施職權、但頗鮮效果、故近有美僑建議籍美國郵局而向日本施報復者、</p>

<h3>由端午節的雄黃燒酒說道　夫婦生活的夏令衛生</h3>
<p>吃粽子果然要聯想起養兒子；　養兒子要養送命靈力號兒子！</p>
<p>在中國社會的風俗裹，每逢端午佳節除掉吃粽子之外，無論大大小小男男女女都要喝些雄黃燒酒，在孩子們的面上手上甚至全身，都抹着雄黃燒酒，好像唱戲的大花臉；此外在家屋裏都挿滿着菖蒲艾葉，或更焚燒着蒼朮白芷，雖然說是辟邪，實際上就是老法的衛生運動，其意義在唤醒人知道夏令到了，五毒叢生，一切均須注意預防。不錯，一到夏令，天氣溽署，人體組織鬆弛，各種病毒的細菌孳生，蔓延所至，癘疫流行，這是不可疏忽的！但夏天因氣候炎熱，男女們的身上均穿着僅有而又最輕薄的衣服，肉體橫陳，人是感悄的動物怎能不爲所動呢？所以說夏天在男女之間實是最香艷肉感的季節。在巴黎一個半裸的女神像，雖在走路的人也要佇立一回以寗靜欣賞，何况眞的生動的模特兒呢？試想於香湯浴罷，偕悄侶同遊於花前月下，彼此相互的交流着愛的源泉，情話慇慇，這是一種多麼美妙的境界！不過在此境界男女均須有相當的節制。然後愛的生活才能永遠地美滿。</p>
<p>身虧慾旺，這是不朽的名言，如果男子患有遺精腎虧陽萎早洩，發育不全，神經衰弱等症，那慾念最易衝動。但在眞正的夫婦生活上反曇花一現，心餘力拙，衷心疚恨！同時妻子熱情旣爲挑返，而又不能予以滿足，這是多麼痛心疾首呢？所以在此香艷肉感的夏季，對於慾念必須有充分的克制能力，然後才能幸福，而確保健康，吾則不但痛苦而亦危險之至！欲治愈上述各症及有充分的制慾能力，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，（分男女兩用），最爲對症特效，男子服後卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育，調整新陳代謝，女子服後卽能調經種子，使乳峯聳起，面頰紅潤，增進健美，若能長服，則可延年益壽返老還童。惟男有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（正威大陸華英中法中西等大藥房有售）以制止遺洩，收效更速。上述良藥，因其品質高貴，效力確實偉大。中西人士均推爲聖藥，樂於採用。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯可以左右女性畢生的命運</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>不用諱言，無論怎樣老成持重的男子，假如看到一位丯姿綽的，肉感動人的健美女性，誰都要注目凝視，心裏起着一種莫名的愛悅的，健美女性之所以這樣可貴，這樣値得人們愛慕。不能不歸功於胸前的一對乳峯，因爲女子的乳峯，正似琉璃塔上的頂尖，沒有了它，那麼塔身無論搆築得怎樣精美玲瓏，終覺得不成樣子，一個女性而沒有高聳的乳峯在胸前起伏着搖曳生姿，那麽她縱有王嬙飛燕之美，穿上極時髦的衣服，也祗多被人稱上一聲「病西施」，不爲時代男子所重，這是可以斷言。所以現在歐美各國的年輕婦女，她們對於愛美，已不肯浪費無謂的脂粉之費，而注重於乳峯一部的發育，她們對於乳峯，不啻視作第二生命，一有萎癟狀態。無不文卽以德國名藥女用「生殖素」爲彌補，蓋乳峯萎癟的主耍原因：爲生殖腺卵巢機能受束胸，自凟，月經不調，白帶貧血等症所摧殘，以致影響新陳代謝作用所致。故最根本的辦法，自以服卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」爲最特效。此劑歷經英國皇家醫院哈佛洛克愛立司院長及美國百特生醫院魯興博士等化騐證實，均認爲配製精良，功效偉大，不論寒暑，均可常服，如在黃霉多濕的季節里服之，不但可以使萎癟的乳峯，逐漸高聳，且能調整月經，增强體內各部組織，旺盛新陳代謝作用，產生多量新細胞，使一切病菌不敢侵入，美顏强身，其功效眞難盡述。</p>
<h3>遺精就腎虧的先聲</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>婚後男子的患腎虧症，普遍在今日的社會上，症象就是在夫婦間春閨喜劇進行時，每呈早洩陽萎，精力渙散，把好事弄成壞事，此外在日常工作上則感覺腰酸背痛，肢體疲乏，至於腦力衰弱，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花等症象，那是與腎虧常相併發的腦弱症。</p>
<p>靑年人的身體，應當像春筍般茂盛茁長，何以而患腎虧腦弱？這大都爲犯有自凟或更繼起了遺精之故。因爲靑年人體中的精液，是他最寳貴的生命源泉，功能調整新陳代謝作用，旺盛發育機能，而對於神經的影響爲尤大。若因自凟遺精，把精液消耗過多，則身體必然虧損，首受其害者，厥爲腦腎。所以凡遺精失治者，腦弱腎虧症象，幾乎爲不可避免。此外全身發育不全，局部短小如指，黃面肌瘦，未老先衰，壽命縮短亦時常玉腎虧腦衰迸發。誠如這樣的男子，處處表現着無能爲力，不特爲學習業，均無成功希望，就是傳宗接代的夫婦生活上，每使尋歡反爲不歡，夫婦愛情毫無，或子女無出，貽終生大憾！</p>
<p>遺精的唯一治法，必須淸心寡慾，戒絕自凟，同時服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則最爲對症特效。若因遺精已引起腦衰腎虧，發育不全，未老先衰等症象者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育機能，若繼續服用，必可於短期內根治上述各症，幷使身體格外健康。息者如能親來本診所診治，同時施用電療注射等法，則收效允速。</p>

<h3>電療在治林上之新價值</h3>
<p>在近十年來，淋病療法上，確有飛躍之進展，而理學療法方面，尤有長足之進展。以理學療法中之電療而言，始則採用波長，繼而發見長波電療，在某種塲所，尚不能發揮其殺菌之特長。於是更進而研究改良而發明短波，在應用與殺菌的效率上，誠非長波所及。但在某種塲所，仍有缺點，而長波則仍有優點之存在。故長短波電療於淋病治療法上，如輪相輔，不可偏廢，但兩者之缺陷甚多，不可備舉。因此對於電器械之本身上，經一般學者不倦地精進研究，益見進歩。以現在一般醫家所用之電療而言，多失之陳舊，殊不足合吾人理想上殺菌之效力。因之一般浮猾淺識之流，一概抹殺，未免太過。因現在確已發明最合吾人理想之電療——濾淋平流電療法。</p>
<p>濾淋平流電療，是德國電療界中最新之發明。其透射與殺菌力，恰到好處。無過與不及之弊。能將急慢性淋病淋部之淋菌，加以澈底之掃盪。故歐美各大花柳病院，無不有濾淋平流電療機之設備。自濾淋平流電療發明而後，電療在淋病的治療上已有新的估價，余十數年來之經騐，在電療中要以濾淋電療爲第一。如能詳察病情，而輔用對症療法，如攝護腺炎之輔用按摩，關節炎之輔用希氏血淸，自能限期根治。因濾淋電療既能殺菌而濾淸淋毒，而血淸又能撲滅血液中之淋菌也。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我對於「愛國者」的感想</h3>
<p>— 司馬聖</p>
<p>很早就把「愛國者」的原書讀了一遍，頗有許多感想要發揮；要是其時正有許多人動員繙譯，大有轟轟烈烈的情況、似乎未便湊趣多嘴。近來看到了市上發售的幾種譯本，也讀到了自由談上林英先生的『「讀過了「愛國者」』一文，不禁百感交集，竟非發揮一下不可。</p>
<p>我對於「愛國者」的感想，大致與林英君相同；所不同者，就是我沒有像他那樣被『感動得以致忿怒』。賽珍珠的小說，平心說一句，是沒有什麽了不得的；尤其對於中國人事的描寫，簡直淺薄得可笑。她在『大地』中描寫的中國農民生活，雖然可以『向西方賣賣野人頭』，而給我們自家人讀了，總看得出許多破綻來。然而因為她是一個西方人，所以這一點認識，仿佛已夠使讀者們敬佩；（中國文壇上不知還有多少比她更淺薄的作品！）而她之所以能夠『轟動了美國出版界』，『發了一筆大財』，甚至還得到諾貝爾獎金者，大槪就是為了這一個緣故。以這樣一個認識不夠的作家，而描寫這樣偉大的塲面，這樣動亂的時代，這樣繁瑣的題材，事實上是一定不會好的。所以『愛國者』的失敗，乃是意料中的事情，本來是『何足道哉』的。可是這樣一部並不高明的著作，此次不僅又『轟動了美國出版界』，而且更『動員了大批文化人去繙譯，鼓吹』，却有點出人意表了。林英君之所以『感動得以忿怒』者，大致為此。</p>
<p>我以為『愛國者』的缺點，是在避難就易，避重就輕，避煩就簡。這個故事的塲面，旣然包括了最近十年來的中國大事變，那麽重在描寫這些事變所反映出來的中國人；旣然展開到對日抗戰甚至漢口撤退以後的時候，那麽理應描寫到中國人民震撼世界的英勇抗戰的態度。而作者却由於經騐的不夠，竟把這些重要的因素都滑過了。所以我們翻檢原書，幾乎發現一半以上的篇幅是在描寫一段戀愛的故事；而那小半的篇幅中，也並沒有着力的描寫和渲染，反而儘量地避過一切實際的塲景。這是我所發現的最大的缺點。</p>
<p>此外，作者對於書中的人物，寫得很糢糊；這種糢糊還是由於她的認識不夠，經騐不夠。吳以璠和劉恩來應該是兩個前進的典型，可是被她寫成了兩個傳奇似的人物，無多可取。不過，林英君以為竟有對中國侮辱處，我覺得那是有點過火的。他所摘錄的幾段，雖然『聲明』『不是斷章取義』，但我覺得却是誤解了原義。『作者把通州事件如此的表現』，乃是描寫日本報紙上無恥的宣傳。『作者……挑選了這不幸的事而加以諷刺』，以及諷刺中國空軍和陸軍，乃是描寫以珂的漢奸意議和漢奸理論。這在小說中似乎是必要的，因為小說中的人物，不會個個是英雄，個介是好人，總有壞人，和反面的言論的。</p>
<p>我不是偏袒原作者，却覺得賽珍珠或者是頗表同情於中國的，但因為她認識不夠，經騐不夠，因而描寫得非常糢糊，有點弄巧成拙而已。如果不信，我也可以摘錄一段在下面：</p>
<p>『我看見，我親眼看見——他叫他們帶一個婦人到他的營帳裏。她是哭着而且掙扎着，但是他毫不在意地向她走來——我是狂了。我走到街去—我—我看到第一個女人——一個小孩子—該是十二歲—雖然也許她還只有十歲，也許十五歲—她也許是年歲說小的（疑係譯錯）—我也拖她到弄內去。……』</p>
<p>去做什麽？我想不必摘錄下去了。這裏所寫的，就是某國人的慘無人道的暴行！而這樣的描寫，『全書中』也是『隨手可摘』的。</p>
<h3>給無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 時光</p>
<p>朋友：我是最怕孤獨，和冷靜的一個人。我對於孤獨和冷靜，正仿佛漆黑一團的無燈無星月之夜，處身於萬丈深淵，要爬過幾萬重隧道一般的使我駭怕。</p>
<p>在戰前，我有着許多互相了解，互相同情的朋友，常常聚在一起，所談的多半是世界現狀，國際形勢；一般朋友們也慷慨，豪爽，熱心，努力，負責，竟超過了一般的男子。可是戰後不久，兩個失蹤了，失蹤將近二年；一個犧牲了，她犧牲的時候正是去年今日！</p>
<p>祗有我在今天，還孤零零的居留在這魔島上，過着弱女子的生活，一切都成了我的回憶。但我並不沉悶；你們，殉道者是光榮的死去了，然而你們已成就了自己底志願，你們的偉大精神是永遠存在着的。</p>
<p>啊，友人，這會，又是一個消息傳來，我幾乎不相信我的耳朵，你又為國捐軀了！眞的你死了，我笑，我笑你的求仁得仁，一個生長在海外的僑胞，會犧牲到烽火連天的祖國的懷抱裏來，從美國流浪到中國，血染沙塲，那是何等偉大呀！</p>
<p>你是一個充滿了朝氣的靑年，在隊伍裏，你更刻苦地担負着责任，入伍不到二個月，你就以一人而兼四職，以上火綫衝鋒有你當先，敎練弟兄們由你去，編大衆歌曲敎老百姓唱，辦壁報，也是你。</p>
<p>我還記得：「環境是這樣，但我得改造環境，和環境鬥爭！」是你說的。</p>
<p>『朋友，希望你勇往直前。不錯，環境是要我們去創造的呀！』當我聽到你講述起那地方的某種特殊情形時，總是這樣勸你。我們在初會時，你給我的印象就很深刻，我們是這樣的互相認識了，但其間竟沒有更多的機會作竟日之長談，因為大家都忙啊：你是剛毅而老成，極其機警，遇到一件困難的事情，兩個眼睛常會變作深黑色。你同情着世界上所有的被壓迫者，甚至親自去當碼頭工人，也到工廠裏去做過小工。像你這樣的孩子，還是生在資產階級家庭中的人，究竟是少數啊！</p>
<p>從今以後，你安然長眠在祖國的溫暖的泥土中吧，磷磷白骨和鮮紅血肉，都做着在成長中的新中國的肥料。不久的將來，這塊土地上會長着更美麗的蓓蕾的。</p>
<p>啊！偉大光榮的死者，永遠在我們心裏活着的無名英雄，什麽時候，我能帶一束鮮花，撩開墓前的靑草，肅穆地獻在你的面前呢？</p>
<h3>內地來的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 綸亭</p>
<p>來吧，朋友們！如果你們不打算來的，你們一定要來；如果你們打算來而還想慢些來的，你們早些來！</p>
<p>我知道你們在孤島上不滿意。你們有的在讀書，却是不定心，因為上海根本不是讀書的地方，而現在為尤甚。你們有的在作着一些小事，勉強可以鍸口的職業，却覺得無聊，以為這樣工作着，太沒有意義。你們有的在闖蕩着，或者更受到生活的壓逼，乏味得無以復加。你們大家都想過得滿意些，痛快些</p>
<p>那末，奇怪，你們為什麽不到內地來呢？內地有的是自由，你們要做什麽便什麽。內地有的是朝氣，可以使一個頹廢的人奮發起來。內地遍是有意義的工作，有力的可以掮槍，有口才的可以宣傳，有專門技能的可以適當地用得其長。內地不但沒有生活的憂慮，更富於生活的實感。你們為什麽不來呢？</p>
<p>你們一定來，並且早些來！你們知道，我們的痛苦在漸漸過去了；我們的光明就在目前了；我們一切偉大的目的，就要達到了。你們不肯來迎接這樣一個時代麽？你們不肯來參加這個時代的實現麽？你們賴在孤島上，如果不是存心等候作亡國奴，難道又存心現在袖手旁觀，而將來則坐享其成麽？你們竟沒有志氣？沒有雄心麽？</p>
<p>自然你們也有種種困難，使你們不得脫身。但是你們忘了「有志者事竟成」這句千古不磨的格言麽？只要你們有志，我相信你們的家庭牽累，一定可以解決；只要你們肯向別人詢問，你們一定可以找到適宜的途徑。</p>
<p>請你們暫閉你們肉體的耳目，用心靈的耳聽一聽，我們在喊着你們，請你們就來參加不久就要舉行的喜筵；用心靈的目看一看，我們在向你們招手，請你們和我們一同打退侵略者，然後一同建設我們的新中國！</p>
<p>來吧，孤島上的朋友們！</p>
<h3>（七）得勝的經歷</h3>
<p>勝利為人所吉喜，失敗為人所惡；然而人能過得勝生活的有幾個呢？基督徒保羅說：『我是攻克己身，叫身服我。』保羅知道人最大的仇敵是自己。人能攻城克地，未必能攻克自己。我可以坦白的吿訴讀者，就是你自己，你知道在外面尚可粉刷，但在內裏是絕對可咒詛的自己！人的自我，毫無良善！陷於罪阱，無法自拔！綜計一生，自幼迄今，所沾罪污，不可勝數！即保羅亦曾懺悔說：『我所作的，我自己不明白，我所願意的，我並不作，我所恨惡的，我倒去作，因為立志為善由得我，只是行出來由不得我。我眞苦啊！誰能救我脫離這取死的身體呢？』但是根據聖徒保羅述說其得勝的經歷，乃是這樣：『我感謝神！靠着我們的主耶穌基督就能脫離，就能得勝了。』可見保羅勝利生活的秘訣，不是靠他自己的作，是依靠他歸服主耶穌。歷代以來，無數基督聖徒，在他們生命的經歷中，都證實保羅的話，是千眞萬確的。——上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>蘇聯：『我只好少陪了。』</h3>
<h3>印象的旅遊（續）</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>「但愈是有惰性文化心理的人，愈是呌人憐恤，愈將被人看做「雅逸」，愈可以安安適適的生存下去。如果這種心理成為目前的趨勢，那可糟了，文學一定將變成甘草薄荷一類的東西，喫了可以淸心凉肺，可治不好什麽眞正的病。文學是應該做得比甘草薄荷有效些，至少它應該能醫治流行感冒。</p>
<p>『一個作用懶惰，第二個作用也會懶惰起來。因為以懶惰的思想和藝術來搪塞觀看人，第二個作家以為這必是一條較易走的途徑，以為一角錢購來四五包美麗牌紙烟必非出自小小倖運。於是大家趕做便宜貨了，我覺得這很悲哀，因為人們都在逼近我們走這一條沒落的路！……』</p>
<p>『……不妨嘗試着做些大作品，離開那些非份的希望。』</p>
<p>我將這一段思維截下來，安插在這裏。我覺得這手法，呌這篇文章所生的小小價値，已彀不少，已彀你輕描淡寫的段落間，得些好的印象吧。我自己以作者的名義號召，我豈能啟導別人，但我却这樣說過了。</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>淸早，淸早，小和尚來敲門，說是早點預備了，用了好去看太陽出山。我扒起來，從黑暗中辨別了面前的路，一面呌醒兩彭，來到點了光的客廳。</p>
<h3>飛翔</h3>
<p>— 今昔</p>
<p>不安於平庸，</p>
<p>我有飛翔的志願，</p>
<p>在無邊的原野上，</p>
<p>無數羣衆的前面，</p>
<p>勇武地不停演講，</p>
<p>使羣衆都受感動，</p>
<p>顏色興奮似發狂。</p>
<p>於是，不論日夜，</p>
<p>當我一發言時，</p>
<p>如同海波的聲，</p>
<p>必然會動盪；</p>
<p>刀劍相擊，</p>
<p>不停地叮噹，</p>
<p>眞理得到勝利，</p>
<p>呻吟的強盜滅亡。</p>
<p>我再向羣衆宣稱；</p>
<p>我們新生了，</p>
<p>在美麗的社會中；</p>
<p>讓我們為光明的勝利而舉起火炬；</p>
<p>我們的寳劍高擎在頭上。</p>
<p>我們不安於平庸，</p>
<p>我們要飛翔！</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>自從「讀過了「愛國者」」發表以後，很有些讀者來表示他們的意見，現在我們發表了司馬聖先生的一篇，其他只好割愛了。因為我們覺得，對於這書，有這樣的兩篇文章，也就夠了，如果沒有特出的見解，我們就不打算再談下去，以免浪費篇幅。</p>
<p>不過司馬聖先生以為書中的反面文章並非侮辱中國，這一點，我却不能同意，因為我們愛中國，就不肯公然講這些話，賽珍珠自命也愛中國的，為什麽就肯公然講呢？何况這些話並非事實，不過是她捏造出來的一些噱頭，來騙騙西方人的。說她侮辱中國，不見得過火吧。</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>洋商不用滙劃</h3>
<p>— 秉中</p>
<p>洋商不用匯劃，一則是滙劃不能直接購買外滙；要買外滙，尙須經過貼現手續，又要破費千分之數十貼現費，纔可取得法幣，洋商怕麻煩，省費用，就拒絕使用了。</p>
<p>然而這是不應該的，因爲將各銀行存軟變成匯劃，是中國財政部的命令，駐在中國的外人，應照常流通，不應加以岐視。但是據說外人名正言順的不用滙劃，是經過司法裁決的。</p>
<p>當改行滙劃之始，中國人有付洋商以滙劃，如房租等，洋商拒絕，繼以涉訟，結果是華人敗訴，據說是滙劃是限於同業間使用，這是八一三戰前的情形，確屬如是；但八一三以後之滙劃，實際性質，却有所不同了。洋商得到了這判詞，更覺振振有辭，決然拒用滙　了。</p>
<p>因此，使匯劃的流通，受到絕大的打擊。</p>
<p>然照最近財政部批復針織業公會規於法幣與外幣折合率的解　看來，就可明白道件的應吾了。即是「法律條文，有何爭執，須由司法機關解釋。」但「因法幣與外幣之折合率發生疑問者，均應遵照部批，一致奉行，各級法院並應統一適用」，那末，匯劃之通行，常然不受任何方面的牽掣了，洋商何有拒用之理。</p>

<p>飾金進出混亂</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初開大同行仍懸二百七十元、而收進價因烚赤受限制提取法幣影響、雖無正式行市、但塲外暗盤暴落、故進價須照兌出價撳低十五元、午刻因烚赤愈疲、故須作低二十元、下午二時許、因烚赤塲外買價已回高至二千六百元關邊、故收進價回上十元、延至傍晚、大同行兌出價仍爲二百七十元、新同行爲二百六十八元、而收進價均减低十元光景、照平常收進的减七八元、一</p>

<h3>新安定金融辦法</h3>
<p>— 盛慕潔</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生後，財政部爲安定金融起見，曾施行非常時期安定金融辦法和補充辦法，經過二十二個月的運用，尚無大窒碍之處。最近財部又在平準基金委員會調整匯價之後，於六月二十二日起施行一種新的安定金融辦法，內容非常簡單，大要是自二十二日起對於存款的支付在五百元以內的支給法幣，五百元以上的以滙劃付給，八一三以前的存款仍照安定金融辦法去辦理。至於匯入內地的資余不受此項辦法的限制，同時此項辦法亦限於在上海施行。</p>
<p>戰期中上海金融狀况，起初因有安定金融辦法的施行，狀態雖然緊張，可是危機是相當輕微。但是安定金融辦法日久漸漸失其效用，同時因有劃匯貼現制度的產生，愈加使安定金融辦法削弱封鎖資金的效用，到今年，上海金融上不安的現象逐漸顯露出來，我曾經就這兩點上加以論述：第一，上海今融因資金充裕而生的結果，實在不容澳視，因上海資金充裕，金融業活期存款增加頗多，但上海旣缺少正當運用的途徑，而資金內移開發西南，又因環境關係未能充分利用，因之大部份資金轉用於投機事業，結果造成租界物價高翔與工業畸形發展。此種現象非但不利於上海金融市塲的安定，且與政府戰時金融政策背道而馳。第二，外匯上的壓力，上海的對外貿易本年五個月的入超累計的在一萬萬兀左右，而逐月貿易悄形，進口增加，出口减退，入超累積愈多，外匯數額需要愈鉅。同時日僞的套買，亦是虎視耽耽，所以安定金融辦法到現在差不多等於具文了。</p>
<p>自從六月七日外滙平準基金委員戶調整匯價之後，外匯市塲顯然處於不安的狀態之下，現貨行市雖與匯豐銀行掛牌價相等，可是期貨則極其萎縮，現期差額甚大，套利高到五分，因之投機者紛趨套利的一途。上海金融在此種局面之下，頗現緊張狀態，拆息，劃滙貼現，日趨高升。倘對此種現象沒有一種辦法來限制它的發展。則對調整後的滙價仍是非常有害的壓力。故爲求匯市安穩起見，祇有對於法幣加以約束，——這便是新安定金融辦法施行的最大理由。</p>
<p>新安定金融辦法施行後的莉益，最顯然的便是减少外滙上投機的需要，和平衡現在帶有投機性的商品價格、最顯然的弊害便是商業一時的週轉不易。同時因辦法太簡單，施行起來便有幾多矛盾，譬如一張超過五百元的劃頭支票存入銀行，有的是收的，有的則不收，說是滙劃，前者當然是對的，後者則不免誤會了。因爲劃頭本來能付現的，現在財部的新辦法，不過說祇能每五百元一星期地支取而已，支取超過五百元以上的給與滙劃，並未說劃頭已變成匯劃了。總之，上海的銀錢業最好再擬出一個詳細的補充辦法來，在封鎖資金的原則下仍能靈活商業的交易。</p>
<p>最後，新安定金融辦法　行後，匯劃貼現的制度實在應當設法取消，否則超過五百元以上的數額即是匯劃，資金仍無法封鎖的。</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、因政府授令金融界、限制提款、防止投機者操縱匯市、因詳細辦法尚未接得、因之各處異常混亂、昨日絕無交易、</p>
<p>現棉生意、中外貨一筆未有成交、廠方亦無舉動、大概亦係貨款問題、難以解決、以致停頓矣、惟印棉塊角大跌二三羅比外、外匯亦掛長、採算價方面已趨低廉、然在此混亂狀態中、亦不能捉摸也、</p>
<h3>投機難再活動　現鈔停頓</h3>

<h3>迎位入祠</h3>
<p>上海縣城隍秦俗伯公，爲元朝進士。易朝後，明太祖曾三次下聘，乃一代之賢臣。墳在浦東裕伯橋。今因新造祠宇，恭請神位供奉，於前十八日，由邑廟迎往；是日在會書役，盡皆恭送，大爲熱鬧，均送至碼頭下船，隨往者，惟紅班等會首耳，餘者一概撤回。此决城隍神並因上屆海運，全數無險，由大吏奏奉恩旨加封「靈佑」二字，以答神貺。其加封之典，天宮風龍海神皆與焉。蓋上年海運，不但風波無險，目無潮濕及船戶水手盜賣等情事，實爲從來未有。此蓋亦上皇之洪福，聖大子百靈相助也。</p>
<h3>勘修洋涇橋工程</h3>
<p>租界四川路之洋涇橋，爲車馬往來之要道。橋係木質所成，年久將頹，經西商工部局估計修造之費，應須一工料銀一千三百二十兩。當函致道憲，請貼橋價三分之一，沈觀察循例檄會審分府陳司馬，會同西總領事派委晏翻譯，偕工部局蘇拍履勘，其橋在洋涇浜出浦相近，往來繁劇，橋面已朽壞，夏秋之間，業已堵截卓馬，祇准行入往來而巳。今之修造，須換橋柱，與重新無異。共橋柱原用六寸見方之洋木，今則改用一尺二寸。以一丈二尺入土，六尺出水。橋面長四丈八尺，闊則二丈二尺。較之從前工程　，旣鉅且艱。所估價錢，勢難再减。業已勘復，不日即須集匠鳩工。夏令曰：「十月成梁」，此其時矣。</p>

<h3>舞女們的覺醒　舞業婦女聯誼社</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>昨在寗波同鄉會開成立大會　袁履登先生任理事長　星期日假卡爾登演「舞女淚」　售座收入充社中經費</p>
<p>多少年了，那些被看作沒有靈魂，當作玩具的舞女們，在黑暗的深淵裏，儘讓無邊的痛苦來剝奪她們的生命。</p>
<p>然而痛苦是一種力量！那麽些年來，她們身受着的欺騙，壓迫，侮辱，蹂躪，使她們在心底裏滋長了反抗的決心。但，這不是報復，而是她們在覺醒後的自救。</p>
<p>「把自己從痛苦中解放出來吧！把自己像別的人一樣享受一點做人的自由，盡一點做人的義務吧！」她們悲鳴着在困苦艱難的環境中站立起來了</p>
<p>她們瞭解了組織的力量：</p>
<p>她們進行組織不是從今天開始，在暗頭裏，幾個先覺的舞女去推動和啟發那些含着眼淚過生活的姊妹們已有一二個年頭了。</p>
<p>在社會正義之士援助下，在她們自己努力下，「舞業婦女聯誼社」總於在昨天正式成立了。</p>
<p>為了要把這個團體成為每一個舞女自己的團體，為了要使每一個落後的舞女都來參加，這團體的組織，在開始時，將不像別的團體那麽枯燥，她們雖然將有識字班，但，主要的却是以趣味活潑的而又是正當的娛樂（如歌唱班乒乓隊等）去吸引她們來參加，目的是把她們糜爛的生活中吸引到正軌的生活中來。</p>
<p>等到她們養成了集體生活的習慣以後，才給她們一些淺近的活的配合她們生活的敎育，如組織讀書研究會，知識講座，戲劇研究等等。</p>
<p>其它，還有義務法律顧問，當一個社員眞的受到欺騙的時候，社裏就派律師出庭為她辯護，自然，如果是敲詐，那麽社裏非但不派律師，有機會時還得勸導一下。還有醫藥顧問，也是義務為貧病的舞女効勞的。在計劃中，她們還想在社裏有消費合作社，和生產技術訓練。</p>
<p>「舞聯」的成立大會是昨天下午二時假座寗波同鄉會舉行的，雖然是那麽熱的天氣，而參加的各舞塲舞女也有一百多個。贊助人到的有袁履登，陳鶴琴，陳憲謨，李文杰，朱立波，蔣逸霄等十餘人。</p>
<p>會開始舉行時，由主席團四人（王琴珍，倪文仙，韋楚雲，殷美鳳）分別報，她們的話都講得很沉痛的。</p>
<p>在會塲上，選出了二十一個理事：王琴珍，殷美鳳，倪文仙，楊文英，韋楚雲，楊文仙，周華英，吳英，蔣雲蘭，張莉莉，候羅美，方莉莉，金弟弟，陳露影，周菊君，徐惠珍，沈愛珍，林燕，楊美娟，筱美　，金莉莉。</p>
<p>名譽理事都是社會名流，和婦女界領袖，理事長由袁履登担任。</p>
<p>如果沒有意外，在這個星期日上午卡爾登演出「舞女淚」（襲稼農導演）「上海舞女」（吳邨導演）後，她們的社中的經費有了着落，她們的社務立記得就開展啦！</p>
<h3>夏令藥品的兜銷者</h3>
<p>— 張正</p>
<p>步行人——請留心隨手接來的劣質藥品</p>
<p>在上海都市裏，一年四季，要以夏季活躍的事物，最為眾多，最為蓬勃。現在是夏季，一切異於其他三季的商品，自然都隨着熱氣溫的降臨而陸續出現。因天象的變換和氣候趨於炎熱的關係，夏季裏又是一個多病的季節；由此，所謂某丹，痧藥水，避疫丸等就成為最流行的藥物。這種東西，以醫學的立塲言，本係用以治病，無可議論；可是，在上海却有些異樣，它也由一般人利用着，以兜售的方式，活躍於各條行人擁擠的路上，以詐騙錢財。</p>
<p>我們只要走上幾條熱鬧的馬路，就會遇到這種人，他們穿着長長的西裝褲，雪白的襯衫，手托着許多什麽丹，什么丸，和一大疊印刷品，樣子儼然是一個推銷商人，雜於人叢中，見人即先送一張印刷品。若不知個中底蘊的人，自然隨手接受，可是他們一經你接受印刷品，就運用其生花妙舌，向你誇張其藥品功效如何大，牌子如何老，……以充分的耐性，對你嘵嘵不休。起初是誇說宣傳；後來就退懇勸購買；或勒逼你購買；如果你還是唯唯否否，他們就切實敎訓你：中國人應該提倡國貨。若你再不承諾購買，那末，他們就亳不客氣的質問你：愛國不愛國？言詞之間，是頗令人難以為情的。若你堅決拒絕，他們會於無可奈何之中，似乎很憤慨地說：「中國是要亡了！這派人一眼勿把國家擺在心上。」意思之間，是購買了這種丹，丸，痧藥水之類，非但對於疾病有恃無恐，而且還是極踏實的愛國份子。這種說法，雖過於强橫，但稍有體面的人，必不屑與之辯論；膽小者，見其掉頭謾罵而去，如釋重負，更不敢與之計較了。</p>
<p>從這種兜售的方式上看來，就可以知道他們那些丹，丸，水之類的本質和功用。我們試化一二角錢買一包來見識見識，它上面雖印着「國貨」字樣，印着能治一切暑症的說明，但在那草率的包裹的包裝上，就表現出了是粗製濫造的劣品，固不必待內行人去研究，才可曉得。當此夏令，暑症頻發之際，對於這種藥品，眞有愼重購買之必要！不過這並不是有惜於一般購買者的幾角錢，　諸虛牝，設若一般人信賴此藥治病，尤其是變幻較速的暑病，其貽誤的影響眞不堪設想。</p>
<p>在他們，祗要有錢收入，就算達到了目的，藥品的本質優劣，那自然是不　顧及的，因為他們是一輩流浪者，旣無錢，又無業，所賴以維持生活的物質，都取之於行人帬中。隨時依據季候所需要，或以易於引起路人興趣的東西來兜售，却並不限於夏令藥品，不過，夏令藥品因為影　於人——擴大點說，還影響於社會，使人不能過於緘默，而有揭穿的必要罷了。</p>
<h3>「卿何薄命」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>“Dark　Victory”</p>
<p>「自我犧牲」，那應該是人類間最高的情操吧？是的，這裏面還應該保留一個條件，那就是這「犧牲」必須是於人類有幸福。損人不利己的把戲是祗有無知者逞一時的意氣才幹出來的，再不然那就是存心拆台的混蛋；然而「自我犧牲」呢，把自己獻出去了，一點兒也不要小我的利益，是的，這是人類至高的美德，可是，如果損己而還是於人無利呢，那麽，這還是算不得一大勇。人是應該為人類的幸福活着或死去的，因為每個人正是人類間的一份；春秋責備賢者，如果祗為「犧牲」，那麽在客觀上，恰好正是親者所痛而仇者所快，無形中便對方增多了一份力量。「泰山」與「鴻毛」之辯是曾使「專家」們也纏在一起爭鬧過不淸的，我這個「觀眾」看「卿何薄命」之後忽然有感，便順手寫出，以呈正於自命為「專家」的「專家」。為恐悮會或曲解起見，應該鄭重聲明曰：這祗是一個「觀眾」的「觀後感」，不敢自居於專家之林，更不想儼然以專家自居而自得其樂也</p>
<p>這好像又寫到「之外」去了，現在就拉回來。</p>
<p>看「卿何薄命」之後，使人感動的也正是這種使別人（當然不是敵人）愉快的自我犧牲的精神，珠蒂在知道她本人生理上的末日已經到來以後，如果為她自己，她是很可能讓她親愛的丈夫留在旁邊然後壽終正寢的，然而她不，她却「恐史（她的丈夫史緹爾醫師）得知，將阻其行，猶强作歡笑之狀，復嚴禁安金（她的好友）出聲。……史起程後，女入室凄然臥於床上，竟從此香消玉殞。」醫學上還存在着若干沒有方法醫治的病症，那是人類間的大敵之一，也是遺憾之一，而醫師的保守秘密，也就成為「正當的撒謊」。珠蒂從恍然若失到發現秘密，以及從放浪形骸到切實的享受人生的樂趣，以至鎭靜而又掩飾地臥於床上，等她最後的時刻。這是一段曲折的歷程，燦爛之極，歸於平淡，無數的觀眾就為這樣一　凄艷的故事所感動，嘆息，乃至恍然。「紅樓夢」中寳玉祭晴雯文中的「茜紗窗下，我本無緣，黃土壠中，卿何薄命」那是祗夠寫其凄怨，而不夠點醒其主題的。</p>
<p>演珠蒂的蓓蒂黛維絲是個能演戲的演員，從頭至尾的戲極重，情緖的變動更極複雜，然而在她演來，却都曲曲傳出，遺憾的是導演者不夠高强，雖然小心細到（如安金訪史緹爾回來那塲戲的焦點之外的汽車和僕人開門），可是缺乏魄力和明快的結果，却使每塲戲成為軟弱，平鋪直叙，亳無氣氛，因之，感動的力量也就大減削弱。「蓋技巧為次，『意識』為重，固任何作品的天經地義，」但如果沒有技巧，則「意識」無從宣達，也是枉然。這是不必「專家」，就像我少讀書的「觀眾」，也略略懂得這一點一元論的。至於「專家」們的高見如何？那則是「觀眾」的我所不敢猜測的了。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>趙樂天聽到那裏，也歎一口氣道：『是的！當初我　到你那封信後也很為納罕。因想為什麽你會變得這樣快，女人的心，眞是不可測度。也以為你受了你家庭的熏陶，所謂「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，因此無可救藥的了。我那時氣糊塗了，又寫了一封很長的信給你，自然這封信是把你罵了一頓。我想你或者也回罵我一頓，倒也是很好的。誰知你竟一字不復，大槪你以為我這樣的人，不屑答復我了嗎？』潘佩英垂淚道：　哥！你說這話，比用刀刺我還痛苦。你後來的兩封信，直到父親被人剿死以後，收拾他的舊文件，方繼發現了。父親的被刺，想你也知道的了，他是自作自受，還遺累着兒女輩以淸白之名。父親死後，我是一向隱匿在荒陬僻壤，不敢拋頭露面，站在人前。縱使人家意存忠厚，對於我並沒有什麽指摘，我覺得人家好像在面前，總是指指點點，說：「這是一個叛國者的女兒。你想我這個隱痛，到什麽時候，繼能消除呀！我近來也不敢居於家鄉，因為家鄉熟人多。我是在某地方一個小學校裏當敎師，我也不敢用眞名字，我只用了一個假名字，因此人家也不知道我的底細。這一回，我回到家鄉來，偶然到惠山去走走。事也是有湊巧，恰遇着了袁淑文，她向我問你，她以為我們在一起。那時我方知道你的踪跡，今天所以特來看你，將以前的事，說說明白。你要恨我不諒解我，我也無法使你不恨，無法使你諒解了。」潘佩英說至此，極力要想不許她的眼淚流出來，無奈眼淚不聽她的心中指揮，偏要奪眶而出。女人的眼淚，却是對於男子有多大的力量呀！潘佩英的一滴一滴的淚珠，打在趙樂天的心腸上，比了他從前當機關槍手的機關槍子彈，還要厲害。何況他們倆本來兩心相印的一封舊情人呢？不過趙樂天以為潘佩英現在當已經嫁了人了，舊日情愫，可以一筆勾起，潘佩英也以為趙樂天也一定娶妻生子，成家立業。自己此來，也不過是表明心跡，心跡表明以後，萬事俱了。我仍當我的小學敎師，他依然辦他的米糧調節事宜，正是東勞西燕，各自分飛罷了。（一四三）</p>

<h3>皮黃義賣前奏</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>上海難民救濟協會同鄉組將於本月二十六二十七兩天日夜四塲在黃金大戲院舉行皮黃義賣，已迭誌本報。這一次的救難運動實始於張肖傖等所邀約的大發食品公司的聚會，時為五月十二日下午七時。我也躬與其盛。當晚眾家英雄，一齊到會，不可無記。我一上樓，就先找</p>
<p>張肖傖　他的「菊部叢談」（？）十幾年前就在大東書局出版了，可說是評劇界的前輩。常州口音，身材和神情都使人聯想到曹聚仁。回過頭來，就看見剃光了頭滿面紅光的羅漢</p>
<p>范松風　他是崑曲名家，曾經上臺唱過好幾次「長生殿」驚變，連忙與他握手。在他身旁，又發現了仙霓社的名小生</p>
<p>周傳瑛　風度翩翩，完全是蘇州人的典型。范先生又為我介紹</p>
<p>許黑珍　我連忙稱讚他在湖社能演冷戲「九件衣，」他的頭髮已經花白，精神却極好；他興高采烈地談起他演「御碑亭」和「帬英會」的機智，現在想要與他作難，結果反而被他難倒了。他說得四座風生，趣味盎然。那晚要是沒有他，席間就要寂寞起來。接着又來了「琴票」</p>
<p>蘇省卿　他曾在朁南大學敎過平劇。因為隔席，所以我未能請敎。與他同來的是他的女弟子</p>
<p>傳雲靈　不久又來了忙碌的菊社的社長</p>
<p>劉菊禪　他在泰東所出版的戲本第一册和戲考一套，似附有身段或工尺，後來的「四郎探母全集」尤為完備。曾同席兩次，均因他怱怱而來，怱怱而去，以未及交談為憾。我們的一席又來了大名鼎鼎的</p>
<p>魏新綠　田漢曾盛稱之。她擅老生，為人倜　自然，說話亳不拘束。她知道我是四川人，向我談起四川前任某警察廳長的趣事：廳長愛玩票，演戲時令警察排立在客座兩旁，有呌倒好者，則警察瞪以眼曰：「你會唱，你上去唱唱看」廳長聞之，遂去鬚演說，以四川口音說：「我唱戲本來是玩玩的，」於是掛鬚復唱云。與她同來的是著名國立大學的女生。</p>
<p>蕭明　她在北平，曾從張彩林和余玉琴學花衫，擅得意綠十三妹等。來滬後更得紅豆館主的指導，對於崑曲也極精，紅豆館主曾與他合過販馬記裏的李奇。我看過她演過「寫狀」（繆府堂會，）唱做俱佳，尤其値得稱讚的是在唱「我爹爹受不住五刑拷打時，蹲身以雙手抱臂的這一身段。來得最遲的是</p>
<p>顧志成　他將與蕭明合演販馬記。他本在鄰席，後來跑過來看我，我拉他坐下，說：「你來打遊擊吧。」他點頭微笑，便坐了一會，又到另一桌打遊擊去了。後來大家討論戲碼，與我同席的幾位，決定</p>
<p>歐壽南　的「棒打薄情郎，」他沈默寡言，性情文靜，演且角是適宜的。還有</p>
<p>曾心齊　的「空城計。」他那精明能幹的外表，高而尖的鼻子，灼灼有光的眼睛，都使我誤會他為廣東人，請敎之下，原來是江西老表。與他合演的許是胖子（我的同志）</p>
<p>金少剛　自然是演司馬懿了。魏新綠大約演（李陵碑）。還有</p>
<p>朱伯平　演（法門寺）的生角。如此盛會，真是難得！希望諸大善士，慷慨解囊，屆時到黃金夫看戲。我這短文就算是請帖吧。</p>
<h3>記譚派鬚生言菊朋</h3>
<p>— 海棠軒主</p>
<p>譚派鬚生言菊朋，應黃金大戲院之聘，不日來滬，消息已誌本報。在今日譚派人材寥落時期，菊朋不失為譚派中之驕子，渠於老譚藝術，確曾下過一番苦心研究，而其咬字發音，尤能獨步一時，為內外行所公認。考菊朋成名及學藝經過，得力於個五者頗多。民國二年，菊朋供職蒙藏院，其時以玩票性質，向侗五叩頭，問蒙第一齣為戰蒲關，菊朋飾劉忠，其時醉心譚劇，每逢老譚有戲，風雨無阻，必往觀摩，第因菊朋收入有限，聽戲之資，皆其友人鐘岳森代出，兩人聽戲，一記詞句，一記身段，每有心得或　得透澈處即向侗五請益。侗交游甚廣，如錢金福，王長林，王瑤卿　，皆出入其門，故能轉請錢等代敎；菊朋得此三人指點，乃亦復不少。當時並入言樂社票房。侗五因菊朋嗓子甚好，宜唱工，故命串洪洋洞碰碑二進宮探母數齣。至民國六七年，陳彥衡在平，兩人一見便成莫逆，菊朋譚腔，更經陳詳細指點，藝遂大進。彼時程硯秋正在大紅，在上海露演，梅蘭芳亦在滬，雙方對壘甚力，梅急須找一跨刀老生，苦於難得人選，經陳介紹菊朋與梅合作，由彥衡操琴，極紅花綠葉之妙；結果一唱而紅，至民國十年，菊朋以票友下海，迭次往濟南，蚌埠，瀋陽，大唱堂會，免得雙收，後忽與彥衡拆夥，並做投機事業，大購公債，縱情嗜慾，更加家庭間有不如意事發生，致使嗓音一度嘎啞，幸不久漸漸復原。言氏探母罵曹定軍山各戲，確有獨到之處，非時伶所能望其項背，此次來滬，與滬上仕女相見，其美滿成績，可預卜耳。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>臥雲居士的墮落與李多奎的上進</p>
<p>有一年他回到北平，偶爾串了一齣滑油山，（因當初杜芬亦　　老旦）臨時請的琴師就是和老　操琴多年的　五先生，　五一　。多奎的本錢真足，因於散戲後勸說他　，你的身個，眼睛，都嫌太小，實在不宜於汪派的王　戲，現在老旦行裏太缺人材，老　一死，就要失傳，臥雲居士近來驕傲的不得了，從前我也很敎了他許多好腔，他也以師禮待我，每次出演，非由我操琴不可。近年以來，他忽然目空一切，誰也看不起了，口口聲聲說是老　敎他多少齣戲，其實他那有工夫敎人，還不是他挑個師傅的虛名，實際上全是我來敎授麽？現在他紅啦，連我也不放在眼裏，我心中着實氣不過，很想尋一個有本錢（即嗓子）的人，把所有老　的好腔和他那幾齣拿手戲全都傳給了他，讓我也出出這口寃氣。我的條件並不太苛，最要緊的就是我敎出來的人須得永遠以師禮待我，將來他無論紅到什麽地步，總須由我替他操琴，不許把我辭退，另換旁人。多奎一想，陸先生的話，很有道理，況且他的條件，豈但不苛，而且於自己還有很大的益處，老實說在北平專拉老旦的胡琴，誰能比得上陸老。再者說老旦是專工，別的琴師拉得再好，但是要呌他拉老旦，就許襯托不上，別說他將來不許辭他另找別人，即令他要離開自己，再帮別人，自個還不肯答應呢。況陸老以能耐換飯吃，人家把戲敎會了我，就是我日後養他的老，也是應該，何況他是以琴自養呢。當時雙方同意之後，多奎遂即專心一志的改習老旦了。適巧不久以後，他姊太梁華亭又接辦了中和戲院，與硯秋訂立了長期出演的合同，多奎就趁此時機加入了硯秋的劇團。　（四四）</p>
<h3>拍攝電影時的妨礙者</h3>
<p>— 穆</p>
<p>攝製影片時給壞東西搗亂所蒙受的損失是很大的。牠們或它們祗是一些微細的東西，在另外的靜寂的塲合還不妨礙什麽。然而無論如何牠們總是壞東西給許多電影導演者所詛咒——特別是霍佛好克，他新近　哥倫比亞公司製作一張“Only　Angels　Have　Wings”（卡蘭克爾，琪哈塞合演），就感到極大的困難，他把這些揭亂者分列如下：</p>
<p>（一）宋蠅　牠可以依附在麥克而風上不給發覺，直到片子和聲帶製好了印出來以後。假使片子被送到放映室去放映之前，還沒有發現，那祗好把糟了的從新拍遏。</p>
<p>（二）飛機　一架飛機在攝影塲上的上空不斷地飛翔着，那是會妨礙到下面的工作，致費去不少的寳貴的時間。</p>
<p>（三）噴嚏　要是有個人到錄音機旁打嚏，就會弄壞了膠片，要重新拍過。</p>
<p>（四）雀噪　鳥兒常會築巢在播音台的屋椽上。於是製片祗好停頓着，讓一些僱員攀緣而上驅逐牠們。</p>
<p>（五）野貓　沒家的貓會把播音台作歸宿處，到拍片時鳴聲不絕，工夫也算是白做。</p>
<p>（六）鞋響　有些不知趣的人路踢踢　　，這些聲音結果都會收到片子的聲　上。</p>
<p>（七）參觀者　一般攝影工作室的參觀者常言不曉得在錄音機　保守寂靜的這條金科玉律，在開拍時總竊竊不休，　演者對於這會感到極大的悲痛。（下略）（却酬）</p>

<h3>Heavy Troops Advance to Counterattack Xiangri; Chinese Troops Still Defend Shantou City Area; Japanese Side Demands Third-Country Warships Withdraw by a Deadline; Britain and America Have Refused; All Overseas Chinese Also Leave Shantou; Zhang Fakui Orders His Troops to Block and Attack Advancing Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - As of 11:00 AM today, Chinese troops are still firmly defending the Shantou city area.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) External News - After fierce street fighting in Shantou yesterday afternoon, a unit of Japanese soldiers attacked the Qiluo Battery in eastern Shantou, while another unit planned to advance towards Anbu in northern Shantou. The British authorities prepared two transports, and this afternoon loaded British overseas Chinese women and children to leave Shantou. The British move is due to the Chinese army deploying heavy troops around Shantou, preparing to counterattack the Japanese army. The British warship HMS Dainty is temporarily not withdrawing from Shantou, and HMS Scott has arrived at the mouth of the Han River. (Special telegram of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese side, considering Anbu, 40 li north of Shantou, indefensible, voluntarily retreated to the predetermined defense line in the northwest.</p>
<p>Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - According to a phone call from the front, as of 6:00 AM on the 22nd, fierce fighting was still ongoing in Shantou. Chinese troops were entrenched in buildings in the northeastern part of the city, using machine guns to strafe Japanese soldiers, killing many. More than 40 Japanese aircraft, in 12 batches, took turns bombing. Until 9:00 PM, they were still circling and dropping bombs in the city area, fully proving that the Japanese side's claim that it had completely occupied Shantou at 2:00 PM was propaganda to deceive the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - The Japanese troops attacking Shantou were severely attacked by the Chinese army and repeatedly requested reinforcements, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese. As of this morning, the Japanese and Chinese were still fiercely fighting in the area of the airfield in the eastern suburbs. The telephone lines between Chao'an and Shantou were still open on the evening of the 21st.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xingning News - From yesterday morning to noon, the Chinese troops in Shantou repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the invading Japanese troops, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. Currently, the Chinese military and political authorities are gathered in a certain place, commanding the troops to continue fighting. A large fire in Shantou yesterday burned all day without being extinguished. Japanese troops landing in Beigang attempted to attack Chao'an. Zhang Fakui has ordered that the Japanese troops not be given the opportunity to advance deep inland. (Special telegram of the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) (Telegram of the 22nd) - According to reliable information, the United States has rejected Japan's unreasonable demands, decided not to withdraw its warship stationed in Shantou, and sent the USS Augusta to Shantou to protect overseas Chinese. Currently, there are more than 40 American overseas Chinese in Shantou. The government has not yet made a decision on the evacuation of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(London) (American United Press telegram of the 22nd) - According to news from here today, the Japanese side's ultimatum ordering British warships to leave Shantou has been rejected by the British fleet stationed in China. The government is prepared to immediately support this move by the British Far East Navy. It is heard that the British government has discussed with Washington a joint approach to the developments in Tianjin and Shantou. The British Naval Minister, Stanley, believes that the Japanese ultimatum is extremely serious in nature and has great political significance, so he asked the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to discuss countermeasures as soon as possible. In addition, the straightforward rejection of the Japanese ultimatum by Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, has greatly strengthened the U.S. stance. The British naval circles believe that Japan has absolutely no right to order ships of other countries to leave the Chinese sea, so they are extremely indignant at Japan's attitude.</p>
<p>(Washington) (Havas telegram of the 21st) - It is rumored that the Japanese naval authorities have issued ultimatums to the authorities of various countries, demanding that warships of those countries, including the U.S. destroyer USS Pillsbury, must leave the port of Shantou, China, before 1:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. Officials from the State Department and the Navy Department all said they knew nothing about it.</p>
<p>(Shantou) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Currently, there are seven Japanese destroyers anchored in Shantou Port. Ma Yu fell yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM. Several Japanese aircraft flew over the city and dropped bombs, and opened machine guns to strafe. The city is still in the hands of the Chinese army. Overseas Chinese in Shantou are all safe. (Tokyo) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - A Hong Kong telegram received here today stated that Chinese troops are currently moving from the interior towards Shantou in an attempt to contain the Japanese advance.</p>
<p>(London) (Havas telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of the port of Shantou, China, it is rumored that the Japanese naval authorities have requested that ships of various countries leave the area. The details are not yet known, but if that country does make such a request, Britain will definitely reject it. Reports from various newspapers that British warships there have already rejected this request are definitely reliable.</p>
<p>(London) (Haitong News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the Japanese request that British and American warships leave Shantou at 1:00 PM today, people here believe that the British and American authorities may not accept it. London newspapers regard Japan's request as an ultimatum, and predict that the result may cause an amazing change in the Far East situation. The British Admiralty has not yet received an official report from Hong Kong, but judging from the situation in all directions, British and American warships have no intention of withdrawing. According to the impression gained by neutral observers, London clearly believes that the Japanese ultimatum is an act of challenge, and at the same time an action to undermine the Sino-British treaty, because the Shantou Customs is a commercial port, which is stipulated in the Treaty of Tianjin in 1858.</p>
<p>(Washington) (Haitong News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - According to people close to the Navy Department, Admiral Yarnell, commander-in-chief of the U.S. East Asia Fleet in Tianjin, has refused the Japanese request to withdraw the U.S. destroyer USS Pillsbury from Shantou, and has also refused the Japanese request to withdraw American overseas Chinese from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Bomb Airfield; Both Sides Fight for Control</h3>
<p>Chao'an (Telegram of the 22nd) - The Japanese troops attacking Shantou first landed several hundred marines at 5:00 AM on the 21st in Donghu and Siji Aotou in Daho, which belongs to Chaoyang, and advanced west in different directions. The Chinese defenders rose up to meet them, and fierce battles broke out in the coastal villages. At the same time, more than 30 Japanese warships, equipped with dozens of speedboats, spied on the Mapingkou, and opened fire indiscriminately at both sides of the coast. The Chinese defenders also responded. At around 10:00 AM, Japanese speedboats, under the cover of warship artillery and aircraft, broke through the blockade line. Immediately, two warships covered dozens of speedboats and approached the coast of Shantou City. The Chinese defenders fired fiercely, sinking more than a dozen Japanese speedboats on the spot and killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army, unable to land, sent more than 300 plainclothes soldiers wearing black clothes, detouring to land at the airfield, and sent aircraft to bomb and strafe, and then transferred from the airfield to street fighting. The Chinese troops defended the city streets and resisted valiantly, and reinforcements were continuously added. As of 6:00 PM, the Chinese troops were still firmly defending and had not retreated. The Japanese troops who first attacked the Chaoyang coast were severely attacked by the Chinese side and once retreated at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Population Evacuation of Shantou Was Handled Several Months Ago</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (American United Press telegram of the 12th) - According to a Chinese spokesperson today, the evacuation and retreat of Shantou civilians and materials was ordered and launched by the military authorities several months ago, so the Japanese army's invasion was expected. It also stated that the Chinese army had already deployed defensive works in the mountainous area behind Shantou and along the Han River to prepare for the Japanese army's invasion. It also stated that previously, the British, American and French churches in Shantou had volunteered to take on the task of establishing refugee camps. The Chinese side did not allow them to be established because the Japanese did not abide by their oaths regarding the safety of refugee camps. The facts in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou and other places could serve as a warning, so they focused on the evacuation of the population. Finally, the spokesperson said that the loss of Shantou was at most the Chinese side losing a commercial port. As for the Japanese army wanting to go deep inland, in fact, due to the terrain and the early deployment of defensive works, it was absolutely impossible.</p>
<h3>Arita Notifies Various Countries of Japanese Military Actions in Shantou</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Japanese Foreign Minister Arita notified foreign diplomatic representatives yesterday of the start of new military actions in Shantou. According to Japanese sources, Arita's note claimed that this decisive action "has no other intention than to expand purely military activities, with the aim of destroying important bases used by the Chinese government for combat." It is heard that Arita has assured foreign diplomatic representatives that the Japanese government's policy of respecting the rights and interests of third countries in China remains unchanged. It will do its best to prevent any damage to the rights and interests of third countries in the current war, and hopes that foreign governments and foreign authorities in China will fully understand the Japanese government's policy and pay special attention to the possibility of preventing all unfortunate incidents. It is hoped that foreign authorities will cooperate with the Japanese army to prevent damage to foreign interests, or at least reduce this kind of damage. It is hoped that foreign governments will take all possible precautions against the "conspiracy" of the Chinese government to involve them in the Sino-Japanese war. At the end of the note, foreign diplomatic representatives are asked to recall the note sent to them by former Prime Minister Konoe on October 12 of last year regarding the prevention of unfortunate incidents in the current war.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Japanese Navy spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa told foreign reporters today that the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou would not cause international disputes, because the locations of third-country properties were known in advance, and the Japanese army had taken special care of them. A reporter asked why the Japanese side had only occupied Shantou today. Kanazawa replied that this was purely due to military strategy, and pointed out that when the Japanese army began military operations on the mainland, it was necessary to mobilize a large number of troops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Seizure of Shantou Is to Aid the Tianjin Incident</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Newspapers here criticized the Japanese army's landing in Shantou, saying that one of the Japanese army's motives for seizing Shantou was to hope to aid its actions in Tianjin. After the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou, due to its geographical location, could be attacked by the Japanese army at any time. This decisive landing was obviously to take advantage of the opportunity to aid Japan's anti-British movement in Tianjin. Shantou is 188 nautical miles from Hong Kong, so the Japanese army's occupation of it gives it a very important naval and air force base, threatening Hong Kong and the transportation between Hong Kong and Manila.</p>

<h3>Restrictions of the Current Financial System</h3>
<p>Since the restriction on cash payments after the August 13th Incident, there was another second restriction yesterday. The difference between this measure and the first is that the former allowed 5% of the deposit amount to be withdrawn in cash each week, while this measure limits cash payments to 500 yuan per week. The former was calculated as a percentage, so the more deposits there were, the more cash could be withdrawn, which was still insufficient to effectively restrict the circulation of cash, and at most, after 20 weeks, all cash could still be withdrawn. However, those with savings accounts of thousands of yuan were inevitably affected for a while. (Later, it was approved that depositors with accounts under 300 yuan would not be subject to this restriction). Now, most small depositors can avoid this pain. Even for large depositors, 500 yuan per week, or 2,000 yuan per month, can meet their living expenses. As for salaried classes, they can be paid in full without restriction. The most difficult are industrial and commercial enterprises. To analyze it: although industrial and commercial transactions also accept checks and drafts, they have their limitations. One is that checks and drafts account for a certain percentage, and cash accounts for a certain percentage. Two is that the price varies between paying with checks and drafts and paying with cash. Even these two have already severely hit industrial and commercial enterprises. What's worse is that if various industries need to purchase foreign raw materials due to legitimate needs, they will be unable to maintain their production with the 500 yuan limit. As for foreign merchants, even for small expenses such as rent, water, electricity, and miscellaneous fees, cash is required, so checks and drafts cannot be used. However, once discounted, cash worth thousands or tens of thousands can be obtained immediately. In short, restricting cash payments and promoting checks and drafts only creates a path for money changers or speculators to profit from the difference between checks and drafts and cash. Moreover, because there are restrictions on cash withdrawals, the financial sector, which owns large deposits, has no use for its huge reserves, and will inevitably be driven to buy foreign exchange and hoard commodities. Furthermore, because large amounts of cash can still be obtained through discounting, they can easily become foreign exchange. As a result, unnecessary foreign goods flow in endlessly, and large amounts of money flow out. Even if they are absorbed by others, there is no way to prevent them. Following this line of reasoning, the result will be the loss of foreign exchange, rampant speculation, soaring prices, and difficult living conditions, which is something that should be paid great attention to.</p>
<p>The intention of restricting cash withdrawals must be to prevent the leakage of foreign exchange and the escape of funds. That is, cash can be used to buy foreign exchange, and restricting the circulation of cash is to restrict the buying and selling of foreign exchange. However, since checks and drafts can be discounted, foreign exchange can still be purchased. This is one. Restricting cash withdrawals only restricts deposits in banks within the Shanghai Concession. If the legal tender circulating in the occupied areas is not affected by the restriction on cash withdrawals in any way, it is even more likely to promote its absorption. This is two. Foreign merchants do not accept checks and drafts. Not only can goods not be paid for, but also general living expenses such as water, electricity, rent, and taxes related to foreign merchants all require cash, so the legal tender is gradually transferred to foreign merchants, and checks and drafts weaken their effectiveness. This is three. Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises have recently seen a gradual decrease in the use of checks and drafts, and a gradual increase in the need for cash. However, deposits in banks that use cash are also restricted from withdrawing the legal tender in full. If they need to pay foreign merchants for goods, where can they find foreign exchange? Therefore, the measures to restrict cash withdrawals cannot achieve the desired effect, but have already caused inconvenience to the industrial and commercial sectors. This is four.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the Chinese government is determined to improve the financial system, it should provide an appropriate amount of foreign exchange at the legal exchange rate for the legitimate needs of industrial and commercial enterprises. After the supply has been approved, the exchange rate for payment should be the same, whether it is a check, a draft, or cash, and should not be limited to providing cash. Then, the practice of discounting will be eliminated without being prohibited. The free buying and selling of foreign exchange in the market should not be supplied. However, this is related to the exercise of power, and only with a fair mind, taking the interests of the entire Chinese industrial, commercial, and financial enterprises as the premise, and without any personal gains or losses in mind, can the success be seen immediately.</p>
<p>If the Chinese government's measures to restrict cash withdrawals stop here without any remedies, then the inevitable result will be that industrial and commercial enterprises, eager to turn over frozen funds, will try their best to obtain legal tender, no matter how high the discount rate is, and purchase foreign exchange in the black market to ensure their safety and meet their debts. The result is that cash will not be easily obtained, and they will have to specialize in accepting cash and refuse to use checks and drafts. Then, the use of checks and drafts will become narrower, and the market will become more chaotic. Some say that this is exactly what is desired, but they do not know that the nature of the business should be distinguished and appropriate maintenance should be provided. If we do not distinguish between right and wrong and all perish together, the failure of industrial and commercial enterprises is not worth regretting, but what about China's vitality? Moreover, the escape of funds may not be completely prevented by the current restriction on cash withdrawals, because those who own large amounts of assets have already made plans to escape. However, we cannot but say that the Chinese government's decision is made with painstaking effort. At least, it may curb the wind of speculation, tighten the effect, and restrain the endless rise in prices. However, it should also take into account the difficulties of general industrial and commercial enterprises and strive to improve the situation.</p>
<h3>British and French Warships Remain in Shantou to Protect Foreign Interests</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - The Japanese naval authorities have requested that all ships of third countries, including warships, withdraw from Shantou Port by 1:00 PM today. Currently, the British transports Yingzhou and Prominent are engaged in the evacuation. British overseas Chinese women and children and other foreigners who wish to leave Shantou are scheduled to depart this afternoon on two transports, because of the Chinese counterattack, there may be fierce battles in the city. Currently, foreign warships stationed in Shantou include the British warship HMS Dainty and the US destroyer USS Pillsbury. It is heard that HMS Dainty has decided to remain stationed in Shantou, because the British naval authorities have announced that the ship will remain in Shantou to take care of the interests of British overseas Chinese. It is heard that USS Pillsbury will also remain stationed in Shantou. According to reliable sources, the US destroyer USS Asheville is planning to sail to Shantou tomorrow. The British destroyer HMS Scott is currently anchored outside Shantou Port and is prepared to jointly protect British interests with HMS Dainty if necessary.</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Comment that Japan's Actions Have a Warning Nature</h3>
<p>(Paris) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - The news of the Japanese army landing in Shantou Port has been published on the front page of newspapers here with large headlines. They all say that the port is one of the last remaining ports for China to communicate with foreign countries. Right-wing newspapers say that Japan's attempt to control Chinese ports to prevent the Chinese government from obtaining supplies is justifiable. However, the Japanese military authorities have landed in Shantou Port after the tension of the Tianjin Incident and when the country's military force should be concentrated rather than dispersed, and after the United States made a strong protest against Japan's actions in Gulangyu. This is unavoidable. "Even if this matter can be said to be unrelated to foreign concessions, what the Japanese army occupies is purely a Chinese port. In fact, international interests are still directly harmed. The Japanese side is the best way to resist countries' cooperation," or it is said that this decisive action is to satisfy the Japanese military so that it will not obstruct the establishment of a compromise plan for the Tianjin Incident. What is more, the Japanese army occupied Shantou Port on the eve of the meeting between the military authorities of Britain and France in Singapore Port, "this matter has a warning nature, which is obvious." A small newspaper said that Japan is taking advantage of the discord among European countries to erode China. It is not surprising that it landed in the last port for China to communicate with foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Protecting the Interests of Overseas Chinese in Tianjin; Britain Will Take Necessary Measures; Foreign Minister Sends Telegram to British Consul General in Tianjin; Britain's Attitude Turns Stronger; The Japanese Side May Accept the Suggestion</h3>
<p>(London) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the Japanese army's blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, Foreign Minister Halifax sent a telegram to the British Consul General in Tianjin, Jamieson, yesterday, stating that the government is determined to take necessary measures to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and resolve this dispute as soon as possible, and asked him to convey this intention to all overseas Chinese, etc. Consul General Jamieson immediately replied by telegram, expressing his gratitude and saying that all overseas Chinese were very excited after hearing the news.</p>
<p>(London) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - This morning, official sources here declared that although Britain is very willing to regard the current situation in Tianjin as a local dispute, it believes that if the methods currently adopted by the Japanese side continue, the result will inevitably lead to Britain's counter-measures to protect its rights and interests. This kind of situation must not be allowed to continue indefinitely. It is expected that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a statement on the Tianjin situation in the House of Commons this afternoon. At the same time, according to official news, the traffic restrictions on the border of the Tianjin Concession have not been relaxed in the slightest. British people who attempt to cross the Concession often have to wait for a long time and undergo severe inspections, and some even have to take off some of their clothes. The French Concession authorities seem to have obtained the daily supplies they need by transporting goods in military trucks.</p>
<p>(London) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 22nd) - Regarding the situation in Tianjin City, official sources here declared this morning that if the Japanese army's blockade continues, Britain will definitely take retaliatory measures. Although Britain hopes that this matter can be resolved locally, if this hope turns out to be empty, then Britain's attitude will become stronger and deal with the current situation in an appropriate manner. This is what the Japanese side should understand. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon, which all parties are eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p>(Singapore) (American United Press telegram of the 22nd) - It is reported here that a large British army unit has now been assembled and is ready to depart for the Shanghai area. This has been recognized by the British military authorities here, but when the situation in North China deteriorates, the troops stationed here are prepared to go to China at any time. The British side does not deny this.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) (American United Press telegram of the 21st) - According to reports here, Britain has taken informal economic retaliatory measures against Japan because Japan has blockaded the Tianjin Concession. For example, British ships have now stopped loading Japanese seedlings to foreign countries.</p>
<p>(London) (American United Press telegram of the 22nd) - According to informal news from diplomatic circles here, Tokyo may accept the British suggestion that the Tianjin Incident is a local incident in its reply to Britain and begin negotiations. At that time, the British side will exchange the handover of four suspects accused of assassinating Cheng for the Japanese side's lifting of the blockade. The Japanese side's request may only be limited to cooperating in cracking down on terrorists. As for other issues, the British and Japanese governments will resolve them through direct negotiations.</p>
<p>(London) (Havas News Agency telegram of the 21st) - When the cabinet held its weekly meeting this morning, it discussed the Tianjin Incident. Regarding this matter, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie has held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Foreign Minister Halifax has also met with Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Mamoru Shigemitsu, informing him of the British government's views and awaiting a reply from the Japanese side. Therefore, the cabinet has not yet made any decision on the issue of imposing economic sanctions on Japan. The Japanese army's attack on Shantou at this time has caused a bad impression and considerable anxiety here.</p>
<p>(London) (Reuters telegram of the 22nd) - Reuters learned today from a key source that the British government has not received a reply from the Japanese government after inquiring about its attitude towards the Tianjin blockade. It is heard that the authorities are now working to move the blockade negotiations from Tianjin to Tokyo. At the same time, Reuters learned that the British government has compiled a list of various methods of applying economic pressure on Japan, which will be implemented according to this list if the Tianjin blockade case cannot be resolved satisfactorily. The Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a meeting within days. It is expected that Conservative Party MP Mooreham will initiate a discussion on the Tianjin case at the meeting, and then consider appointing a delegation to meet with the Prime Minister. There is no doubt that the emotions of MPs from all parties in the House of Commons are becoming stronger. They all feel that the British government's delay in taking decisive action is only increasing the arrogance of the radical faction of the Japanese military, even if it does not lead to worse aggression elsewhere, it will also make it more difficult for the Tianjin case to be resolved satisfactorily. All newspapers are now publishing the news of the Tianjin and Shantou incidents and the preparations for the return of the King and Queen to England in prominent positions, and the two have a tendency to compete with each other. It is rumored that the Japanese side has sent an ultimatum to foreign shipping companies, setting a deadline for their ships to leave Shantou. London has not yet received official information. The issue of the evacuation of overseas Chinese from Shantou will be handled by the local consuls, but those responsible in all circles say that, based on past experience, once overseas Chinese evacuate, they will never be able to "return".</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Report in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, today in the House of Commons reported on the recent developments of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, saying that the restrictions on entering and exiting the concession have not changed. Some British citizens, when passing through obstacles, must undergo long waits and strict searches. Adequate fresh food, after much delay, has been imported into the British concession. In the past, during this sweltering summer, most foreign women and children in the British concession would leave Tianjin for the seaside to escape the heat, and efforts are now being made to enable them to leave as soon as possible. It is reported that the first batch has already departed. The British warship HMS Sandwich arrived in Tianjin on June 20th. The British warship HMS Lowestoft, which was originally scheduled for a transfer, is also temporarily stationed in Tianjin. In South China, Japanese naval and land forces landed near Shantou at dawn on June 21st, and efforts are now being made to evacuate women and children from the area. The necessary transport ships have already set sail for the area. The Japanese naval authorities have agreed to facilitate this evacuation and will respect British property. The British ship SS Sanatt has now arrived in Shantou, and the SS Cotter is expected to arrive today. The food situation on Gulangyu Island is deteriorating, and supplies from Xiamen and the mainland have been cut off. However, there should be no difficulty in transporting food in by ships from third countries. The acting leader of the opposition party, Greenwood, rose to ask that, in view of the repeated acts of aggression that have occurred, even if they are not necessarily directed at Britain, whether the Prime Minister intends to take a stronger action to express the British government's deep displeasure with the Japanese government's tolerance of these acts of aggression. The Prime Minister, in response, assured that the government has paid great attention to the various acts mentioned by Mr. Greenwood, and said that the situation of the blockade of Tianjin is very serious. We naturally still hope that there may be a possibility of resolving this local incident through negotiations, but if these negotiations fail, we will consider the steps to be taken next. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Milner asked whether the Prime Minister was aware of the news that Sir Craigie had "begged" Arida a few days ago, and whether the Prime Minister would be willing to state unequivocally that not a word of this absurd statement is credible. The Prime Minister replied that, on the face of it, he would certainly be willing to say so, as it can be seen at a glance that this statement is absurd and unfounded, and in fact it never happened. Labour Party Member of Parliament Noel-Baker rose to say that what the Prime Minister said was a local issue of the Tianjin incident, but in fact, it has become increasingly clear that it is an act of aggression against the rights of foreigners in China, and may even become an attempt to dominate the Far East. The Prime Minister replied, "I hope not. If it unfortunately comes true, it will be extremely serious." At this point, the Speaker spoke to prevent further questions from being raised. (Reuter's telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan is Testing Britain's Capabilities</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources familiar with current affairs here, if the Japanese side obtains some victory in this blockade of Tianjin, it will inevitably make the warlord forces in the Japanese government even more rampant and weaken the power of the liberals who are trying to obtain assistance from Britain, France, and the United States. It is also said that the purpose of the Japanese warlords in launching the Tianjin incident is purely to test Britain's determination to defend its interests in the Far East. If the Japanese warlords can prove that Britain does not have the courage to take retaliatory action and does not have the determination to fight for its interests in the Far East, then they will be able to gain victory domestically. At that point, the Japanese warlords will be able to proceed with their plan to drive the British out of the Far East, or even occupy the concessions regardless of their neutral status. The Shanghai concessions may also be difficult to escape at that time. A second possible outcome is that Japan may directly join the military alliance of Germany and Italy. This is the possible result of the loss of power by the Japanese moderates (these moderates are firmly opposed to Japan's joining the military alliance of Germany and Italy, because Japan's joining the military alliance of Germany and Italy will cut off the opportunity for third countries to mediate the Sino-Japanese war). But if the British show weakness on the Tianjin issue, the Japanese warlords will believe that Britain has no determination to retaliate against Japan and go to war with Japan, so they will inevitably proceed to drive out the interests of third countries in China, or at least force Britain to give up its support for Chinese currency and other aspects. We will then implement the overall interests of driving the British out of the Far East. It is also said that the lack of agreement on the current British-Soviet negotiations has made the Japanese warlords deeply believe that the peace front will not extend to the Far East. This is what the Japanese warlords are extremely pleased with. Moreover, from the perspective of the Japanese warlords, not only will the peace front not extend to the Far East, but at the same time, there is very little hope of success in Europe. Therefore, they believe that the British-Soviet relationship will inevitably be estranged, the Berlin-Rome axis will inevitably be strengthened, and the European war may break out in September of this year. At that time, Japan can use force to compel Britain to abandon its assistance to China and recognize Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia." Finally, the person familiar with current affairs said that Britain must not adopt a policy of appeasement towards Japan, because adopting such a policy will inevitably make the Japanese warlords deeply believe that Britain has no intention of safeguarding its interests. For the sake of Britain, it must adopt a tough and resolute attitude towards Japan, and at the same time, it must extend the peace front to the Far East in order to be effective.

<h3>US Submission of Negotiations is of Great Significance</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with reporters today, disclosed that the US Consul General in Tianjin had recently submitted a protest to the Japanese Consul General, opposing the blockade restrictions and the inconveniences suffered by American businesses in the area, as stated by the American Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Hull also said that the food supply in Tianjin is still short, but it is slightly more plentiful than before. According to a statement issued today by the Washington American Chamber of Commerce, the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce has expressed its dissatisfaction, saying that the blockade is destroying American trade in important areas, and that the situation is tense and action is urgently needed to avoid serious damage. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Last night, diplomatic circles here regarded the United States' participation in the Tianjin crisis yesterday as having profound significance. Diplomatic circles predict that the Tianjin incident will soon be resolved peacefully. Secretary of State Hull, when confirming that the United States had participated in the Tianjin dispute, declared that the US Consul General in Tianjin, Gotwals, had lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities yesterday. Gotwals submitted a list to the Japanese side, listing the various grievances and inconveniences caused by the Japanese military blockade of the British and French concessions to American businessmen in Tianjin. The protest also mentioned the previous negotiations that the United States had made with the Japanese side regarding the damage to the property of the American people in China caused by Japanese military actions. This decision of the United States to negotiate with Japan on the Tianjin incident is generally considered to be of great significance, because what the United States had previously proposed was limited to the bombing of American property by Japanese aircraft and the Japanese military blockade of the Gulangyu public concession. It was announced here that the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce had submitted a document to the US State Department before the Japanese military implemented the blockade of the British and French concessions, solemnly stating that the Japanese military blockade of the concessions would inevitably damage American business in Tianjin. Hull also told reporters yesterday that American citizens in Xiamen are all safe. (Associated Press telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>After Britain and France Submit New Proposals, the Three Countries Continue to Confer; Molotov Meets with the British and French Ambassadors; The British Cabinet Approves the Policy Towards the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is scheduled to continue talks with French Ambassador Naggiar, British Ambassador Sir Seeds, and Director of the Central European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Stran at 5:00 PM today. At that time, he will also personally deliver the Soviet Union's response to the recent proposals of Britain and France to the representatives of the respective countries. (Havas telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) British Ambassador Seeds and Stran representing Britain, and French Ambassador Naggiar representing France, held another meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov tonight, which lasted for two hours. Talks will be held again in one or two days. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Minister Potemkin, at 5:00 PM today, continued to discuss the issue of the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the three countries with British Ambassador Sir Seeds, Director of the Central European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Stran, and French Ambassador Naggiar, which lasted for two hours. The content of the talks has not been released. According to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, he recently declared to the House of Commons that in addition to the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries, there are other difficulties. This probably refers to how the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be defined. Regarding this, the Soviet Communist Party organ "Pravda" reprinted an article from the German newspaper "Vorwärts News" (Socialist faction) in Paris, which has attracted much attention from observers here. The gist of this article is that the crux of the stagnation of the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is not in the refinement of the wording of the terms, but the prerequisite is that the three countries must first have a common determination to resist aggression, and then use this as a basis, based on the spirit of mutual assistance, evolve into terms, and create a charter. In addition, regarding the promotion of the mutual assistance agreement to the Far East, a reporter from Havas learned from reliable sources that the three countries' negotiations have never discussed it. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet held its weekly meeting this morning and immediately approved the decision made by the cabinet's foreign affairs committee, that is, it does not intend to force the Baltic coastal countries to accept guarantees, but on other points, it will make as many concessions as possible to the Soviet Union. Generally speaking, the new British proposal advocates that if the independence of any country in Europe is threatened, the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can freely decide when their vital interests are harmed. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>British and French New Proposals Have No Progress</p>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, British Ambassador Sir Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and Mr. Stran called on Molotov and personally delivered the "new" proposals of Britain and France to Mr. Molotov. According to the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, these "new" proposals are actually a restatement of the original proposals of Britain and France and have no progress compared to the past. (TASS telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Issue of Expanding the Content of the Agreement</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons today, a certain member spoke, saying that expanding the content of the planned anti-aggression agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to include the Far East will benefit the interests of the three countries. Whether the government agrees with this and will consider it, Butler replied, no, and said that the current negotiations are only about the situation in Europe. As far as he knows, the issue of expanding the scope of the agreement has not been discussed, nor has it been raised by the Soviet Union. Mr. Bai said at the end that there is no proposal to send cabinet members to Moscow to engage in negotiations on the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Chamberlain Answers Questions from Members of Parliament</p>
<p>(London) Several members of parliament raised questions about the progress of the talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union at the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon. Opposition Labour Party member Baker asked the Prime Minister, "Has the British government explained to the Soviet government that it is willing to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union on an equal footing?" Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "Of course, the proposals we have put forward have recognized the principle of complete equality from the beginning." The Prime Minister also said in response to a question from Liberal Party member Mond that the government does not intend to send another cabinet member as a special envoy to Moscow to assist Ambassador Seeds in conducting negotiations. Finally, Mr. Butler of the Foreign Office made some explanations regarding the Baltic countries, saying, "The Soviet government has stated to the governments of Estonia and Latvia that if each country concludes an agreement with another country that would deprive each country of its sovereignty, the Soviet Union would regard it as a serious matter. Halifax is also well aware of this. The governments of Estonia and Latvia have also stated their position, determined to maintain the independence and neutrality of their country."

<h3>French House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee; Foreign Minister Bonnet; Reports on the International Situation; The Three-Country Negotiations Are Proceeding Smoothly; The Results of the French-Turkish Negotiations Are Satisfactory; Hoping for Reconciliation with Spain</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives held a meeting today, attended by Foreign Minister Bonnet to report on the international situation, including the Far East issue, the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the conclusion of an agreement between France and Turkey, and the Spanish issue. Regarding the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow, it was said that "the three countries have reached an agreement on some issues, but because some countries are in a special position and are unwilling to accept guarantees, difficult problems have not yet been resolved. These negotiations are currently proceeding smoothly, and it is hoped that a solution can be found for various difficulties. The French government is determined to devote great efforts to this, and strive to establish a broad agreement as soon as possible, and prescribe mutual guarantees and mutual assistance methods for the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the current negotiations between France and Turkey have been completed, and agreements will be signed separately for the Sanjak region issue and the mutual assistance issue. As for the Spanish issue, France and Spain have adjacent territories, and it is hoped that the Spanish government can, in the spirit of the French-Spanish agreement, reconcile with our country and cooperate closely. At present, the French government, based on this agreement, is seeking a solution to various outstanding issues between France and Spain. It is hoped that the Spanish government will recognize this sincerity. The number of Spanish refugees in France once reached 500,000. In recent months, they have returned to their country one after another. There are still 275,000 people remaining in France." Finally, it was concluded that France is determined to take all diplomatic and military measures to deal with any attempt to resort to force. This is the best way to maintain peace.

<h3>100,000 German Troops Head to the Western Border, Approaching the French Border</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news received here today, it is reported that 100,000 German troops are now moving to the defense line near the French border. In addition, the elite troops of the Nazi Party's High Command, which participated in the Spanish Civil War, will also be stationed in the Saarbrücken area of the border region. At the same time, there is also a large-scale military operation in the eastern region, allowing it to be launched from the Slovak territory that can attack Polish Silesia. As for the movement of German troops in the western region, it can be completed by the end of this month. Among them, the Siegfried Line will also have some troops stationed. It is reported that part of the German infantry, tanks, motorized vehicles, machine guns, and squadrons have already arrived at the border defense line. (Associated Press telegram on the 21st)</p>
<h3>The New French-Japanese Commercial Treaty Will Be Signed Today to Balance Trade Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the negotiation of a new commercial treaty between France and Japan, responsible persons here recently declared that this treaty will be signed in Tokyo on the 23rd of this month. It is found that France's trade with Japan is currently in deficit. Among the goods imported from Japan to France, raw silk and camphor account for 90%. These two items are necessary for certain industries in France. If the import volume is reduced in order to restore the balance of trade between the two sides, this industry in France will inevitably be affected, which is not advisable. Previously, the foreign exchange obtained by Japan from selling raw silk and camphor to France could be disposed of at will. Now, it has been agreed to use it to purchase coal, phosphates, salt, and other various goods from French colonies. The overall trade between the two countries can be restored to balance, which is gratifying. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<h3>The French-Turkish Agreement is Established and Will Be Signed Today in the Turkish Capital, Stipulating that the Sanjak Region Will Be Ceded to Turkey</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of the integration of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic (French mandate territory) into the territory of Turkey, the representatives of France and Turkey have already reached an agreement through negotiations. The agreement between the two sides will be signed by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and French Ambassador Massigli in the Turkish capital on the 23rd of this month. The main points of the agreement are: France will cede the Sanjak region to Turkey. Turkey guarantees to respect France's spiritual and material interests in the region and agrees to protect the various ethnic minorities in the region. Turkey abandons various territorial claims against Syria and agrees not to conduct propaganda in the country. Demarcation of the border between Turkey and Syria, and the Djebel Akra highland is assigned to Syria. In addition, the French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is also scheduled to be signed in Paris on the same day by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and Turkish Ambassador Suad. Its main purpose is to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean. Its terms are the same as the recently concluded British-Turkish agreement. In addition, after the French-Turkish mutual assistance agreement is signed, the French government will issue a declaration promising not to make any concessions to third countries during the French mandate period, so as not to hinder Syria's independence. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the news of the French-Turkish agreement on the integration of the Sanjak region into Turkey was transmitted here, the Italian newspapers wrote articles commenting on it. The general view is that "the result of the Turkish-French agreement will change the original state of the Mediterranean. France's concession of the Sanjak region to Turkey is far from the principle of the mandate system and sets a precedent for the distribution of mandate territories, and it contradicts France's repeated sacred declaration, 'France will never give up an inch of territory.'"

<h3>Spain Assures France that it Will Strictly Adhere to Neutrality; Berlin Denies Inviting Franco to Join the Alliance</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Ministry officials have recently expressed optimism about the future of French-Spanish relations. According to British newspapers, Foreign Minister Bonnet recently met with the Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica. It is said that the Spanish Ambassador provided Foreign Minister Bonnet with assurances that if a war breaks out in Europe, Spain will always strictly adhere to neutrality. However, this statement has not been confirmed by Parisian officials. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the news that was transmitted by the British side, saying that the Spanish Franco regime has just rejected the request from Germany and Italy to invite Spain to join the German-Italian military alliance, authorized individuals here deny it, saying that Berlin has not heard that Germany and Italy have a request to invite Spain to join the German-Italian alliance. The British Broadcasting Corporation's spread of this rumor is intended to focus international attention on this in order to cover up the difficulties encountered in the Moscow talks. (Haitong telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>The German Government Compels the British Consul in Vienna to Withdraw</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to official news, the German government has requested the British government to recall the British Consul General in Vienna, Gaynor, because he was involved in a leak of classified information. As is generally known, the British government recently accused the German Consul General in Liverpool, Lenhard, of being involved in a spy case and demanded his recall. Therefore, the German government is using this as retaliation. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) An official statement said that the German government found it had no choice but to ask the British government to recall the Consul General in Vienna, because in a criminal lawsuit, it was discovered that the country's Consul General in Vienna was involved in the event of a communications agency that had been banned. (Reuter's telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to people close to the government, the German government's sudden request today that the British government recall the Consul General in Vienna, Gaynor, is actually just a retaliatory measure. Although Germany alleges that Consul Gaynor has aided illegal organizations and disseminated anti-German messages in Austria, it has not presented facts sufficient to prove it. The British government is studying retaliatory measures based on the entire course of the case. (Havas telegram on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Singapore) What Britain and France are calling "International Defense Conference" has its representatives already assembled here. Major General McLelland, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in Burma, arrived last night by plane with Colonel Huntly-Davidson, Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence, Indian Army. The plenary session will be held in the gymnasium of the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment at Mengcuster Barracks.

The conference chairman will be Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Fleet. The content of the conference will be kept strictly confidential, and stringent measures will be taken to guard the venue. All countries in the world, including Germany and Japan, are paying attention to this conference. The French representatives are Vice Admiral D'Arcos, Commander of the Far East Fleet, Lieutenant General Martin, Commander of the French Army in Annam, and Colonel Tivey, of the French Air Force Staff.

<p>(Singapore) According to today's Singapore Times, Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China, has today been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in preparation for any eventuality in the Far East. The Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference opened today in the gymnasium of Tanglin Barracks, with over fifty British and French army, navy, and air force officers and generals in attendance. Security is extremely tight. It is reported that after the conference is divided into specialized subcommittees, discussions on various issues will proceed in a highly confidential manner. Also, today's opening of the conference was frequently interrupted by telegrams from the Chinese side. For example, the Japanese request for the British Navy to withdraw from Shantou was one such interruption. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Glimpses of French Naval Commentary</p>
<p>(Paris) British and French army and navy generals stationed in the Far East are scheduled to hold a conference in Singapore today, with British Far East Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Noble as chairman. Naval figures here recently commented that this conference was decided upon long ago and was not convened because of the Tianjin Incident. However, its importance has increased due to the situation in Tianjin. "The Tianjin Incident has already raised the issue of the balance of power between the British and French navies stationed in the Far East and the Japanese Navy. The fleets of Britain and France in the Far East are not strong enough to cope with the Japanese Navy and must rely on the United States to confront it. Although the United States has no representative participating in the Singapore conference, there is no doubt that the military port of Singapore will be open to the United States fleet in the event of war. At this time, Japan is making every effort to avoid offending the United States, but recent incidents have proven that Japan does not want a local resolution to the Tianjin case. Its intention is actually directed at foreigners in general, which is inconsistent with the guarantees provided by the Tokyo government. If this view is given time, the United States will also agree. The recent remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull have already given a glimpse of this. Furthermore, the rejection by Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, of the Japanese naval authorities' request for ships of all countries to leave Shantou Harbor in China is sufficient to show that the United States has now taken decisive steps to accommodate the wishes of Britain and France. In short, once Britain, France, and the United States fully possess a linked relationship, the current situation will change. What is being discussed at the Singapore conference is precisely how this linked relationship should be technically developed." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>"Il Popolo d'Italia" Speaks Up for Japan</p>
<p>Milan "Il Popolo d'Italia" published an article today discussing the strengths of the Japanese Navy and the British and French navies in the Far East, going to great lengths to support Japan. It declared that the Japanese Navy has control of the entire Chinese sea, and that Britain and France are too far away and face difficulties in transportation, making it too risky. The newspaper pointed out that Hong Kong is no longer a base for the British Navy because it has no direct transportation and is isolated. As for French Vietnam, because Japan and Siam have probably signed a secret agreement, its defense will certainly become more difficult. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam Various organizations in Batavia, Java, recently jointly sent a telegram to the Dutch government, requesting the strengthening of the defense of the Dutch East Indies.

Political figures, trade union representatives, and Chinese figures on the island are all members of the committee. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Oil Merchants Negotiate with the Siamese Government</h3>
<p>Will Withdraw from Business in Siam If New Gasoline Law Is Not Revised</p>
<p>(London) The Standard Oil Company of New York and the Asiatic Petroleum Company have recently decided in principle that if the Siamese government refuses to revise the new gasoline law to be implemented in mid-July, the two companies will withdraw from business in Siam. According to the new gasoline law, gasoline companies must store large quantities of gasoline, sufficient to meet Siam's needs for six months. The gasoline companies believe that this provision not only requires increased company expenses and the construction of gasoline storage facilities, but also, from an economic standpoint, makes the stored gasoline unusable, resulting in a financial loss for the company. Currently, Standard Oil and Asiatic Petroleum are in consultation with representatives of the Siamese government, requesting a revision of the provision or a subsidy. If negotiations fail, the two companies will withdraw from business in Siam. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Rumors of Japanese Plan for a Sudden Attack, Tianjin British Concession Strengthens Security, Anti-British Propaganda Intensifies, Newspapers Sing From the Same Hymn Sheet, Food Situation Deteriorates, Meat Almost Non-Existent, Arrested Smith Not Yet Released</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to rampant rumors that the Japanese are planning to launch a sudden attack on the British concession, the authorities in the British concession are continuing to tighten security measures. The Merchant Volunteer Corps is still being mobilized. The patrols at traffic posts have all been withdrawn to strengthen the street patrols. The garrison has been reinforced with a company of Punjabis, some from Beiping and some from Shanhaiguan. British nationals are still being discriminated against at the search points. It is reported that many people were deliberately delayed and subjected to strict searches, including being partially undressed. Foreigners in the concession are increasingly resentful. They feel trapped in a corner, treated like prisoners in a concentration camp, and believe that they are being punished simply for exercising their right to seek a livelihood, a right guaranteed by carefully observed treaties, which were achieved through free negotiation. They also feel that the obstruction of food entering the concession has missed its target, and that women and children are the ones who suffer most. The food situation remains unchanged. Although perishable goods are smuggled into the concession every day, the quantity is less than 20% of the usual supply. The supply of rice and flour is now unlimited, but using flour or rice and water to fill one's stomach all day is better than nothing. A special food committee has now been established in the concession to thoroughly investigate everything. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau is also considering ways to alleviate the food problem. The food situation for the Punjab Light Infantry is satisfactory. This is entirely due to Lieutenant Simmons, an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps, who, on Sunday, accompanied by a soldier, drove a truck across the Wan Guqiao Bridge and purchased several days' worth of vegetables from a Chinese store near the East Station, and returned. Yesterday, he went to the No. 1 Special District and purchased a week's worth of mutton for the army. On both trips, he did not carry weapons. When passing through the Japanese obstacles, he was allowed to pass without being detained. The French concession has a normal supply of food. The French authorities have reached an agreement with the Japanese to use military trucks to transport perishable food into the French concession. The British national Smith, who was arrested on Saturday, is still being detained by the Japanese military police and refused to be handed over to the British authorities. The reason for his arrest is still unclear. British Consul General Jamieson told those who inquired about the matter yesterday that he had lodged another protest with the Japanese Consul General and stated that if Smith was not released immediately, the matter would no longer be a local issue. As of late, there has been no response from the Japanese. Foreigners are paying more attention to this matter. Yesterday, a dog died after touching the electrified barbed wire fence around the concession. There were no other incidents. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Anti-British propaganda has now intensified, to the point of attacking prominent British nationals personally. This is not only the case with Chinese newspapers, but now there is also a Russian-language newspaper expressing the same views. This propaganda is now prevalent in the Japanese-occupied areas and is being promoted by the Japanese and their Chinese puppets. Chinese newspapers under Japanese protection publish lengthy anti-British articles every day, urging the Chinese people to resist British aggression, demanding the return of the British concession, and ceasing trade with Britain. Articles attacking British leaders are also commonly published. The most obvious example is "Shun Pao" (transliteration), a well-known Chinese newspaper in the Japanese-controlled area, which recently published an article stating that Mr. Tebbutt, the Australian Chairman of the British concession, had convened an internal secret meeting and claimed that Mr. Tebbutt had made extremely improper suggestions to the Chinese people at the meeting. The newspaper provided detailed information about the location, date, and time of the meeting, making it seem as if it had actually happened. However, in fact, Mr. Tebbutt was unwell on that day and stayed home without going out or meeting with anyone. Reuters has also been subjected to attacks from Japanese newspapers. "East Asia Renaissance," the official mouthpiece of the White Russian Anti-Communist Committee under Japanese protection, published a lengthy article today condemning Reuters for spreading alarming, provocative, and false news about the Tianjin Incident, and stated that Reuters' news about the current crisis contained special indications of anger, leading to erroneous impressions around the world. Even foreign journalists in nearby Beiping have been deceived by it, and as a result, a large number of foreign journalists, including correspondents from European, American, and South American news agencies, have come to Tianjin to investigate. After seeing that everything in Tianjin was peaceful and orderly, and that although there were some restrictions on passing through the concession, there was no inconvenience, they realized that they had been deceived by Reuters. Today, a prominent Chinese national told a Reuters reporter in person that it took him two days to enter the British concession, demonstrating the difficulty for Chinese people to enter the concession. When the Reuters reporter asked about the situation in the Chinese area, it was said that the residents there were on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to various rumors about the concession. These residents, whose entire lives depend on the concession and foreign businesses, have been severely affected by the blockade of the concession. The Chinese national also said that anti-British propaganda has little impact on the residents of the Chinese area, but is more effective in the Chinese areas of the No. 1 Special District. Therefore, shipping industry sources say that the traffic of ships to and from Tanggu is now quite congested, and ships may not be able to sail on schedule. However, fortunately there are tugboats and other convenient facilities, so there are no major difficulties. This morning, the food situation in the concession was even worse. Milk and meat have virtually disappeared completely, and vegetables are also very limited and of the poorest quality. The Englishman Smith, who was arrested by the Japanese on Saturday and Sunday due to a conflict with the Chinese police, has still not been released, even though British Consul General Jamieson informed the Japanese that if he was not released yesterday, the matter would no longer be a local issue.

<h3>No Food Problems in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since the repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft in May, rice prices here have soared. In order to protect the people's food supply, the Agricultural Affairs Bureau has used its grain reserves accumulated since March to sell grain at fixed prices in large quantities, so rice prices have returned to normal levels. At the same time, new rice from various places is also arriving one after another, and Chongqing's rice reserves can support long-term consumption, so there are no food problems.

Without severe punishment, it would be impossible to rectify officialdom. With the approval of Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission, he was executed by shooting on the 22nd.

<h3>Father Lebbe Discusses the Battle Situation in the Zhongtiao Mountains</h3>
<p>(Kunming) Father Lebbe, head of the Military Commission's North China Battlefield People's Service Guidance Group, recently flew here from Chongqing to treat his old illness and collect supplies needed for the front line. Today, in response to requests from all walks of life, he decided to give a lecture titled "The True Situation of the Resistance War in the Zhongtiao Mountains," stating that "In the repeated battles in the Zhongtiao Mountains, more than 40,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated. The Japanese suffered heavy losses." Discussing the morale of both sides, he said that "Currently, Japanese officers and soldiers are almost universally tired of war, and suicides are common. Chinese troops often find Japanese officers hanging themselves collectively in the forests. Every time they hear about going to war, they all frown and sigh. In peacetime, they often cry and miss their homes. Chinese troops, on the other hand, are eager to fight a hundred times more when they hear the order to attack. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, there has never been a case of anyone being tired of war or committing suicide. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the rifles we used were far inferior to those of the Japanese. Recently, the Japanese soldiers' rifles are not as good as ours. All this proves that the date of our final victory is not far away." (Dispatch of 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cavalry Moves West in Wen County</h3>

<h3>Comparison of Health Between Chinese and Japanese Armies</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese medical authorities today, although the food and living conditions of the Chinese army are inferior to those of the Japanese, the spirit and health of the Chinese army are better than those of the Japanese army fighting in China. According to Chinese investigations, only 2.25% of the soldiers in the Chinese army are sick. In other words, among the two million troops, only 45,000 are sick. However, on the Japanese side, 10% of the soldiers are sick. In other words, among its 33 divisions, 80,000 soldiers are sick. Furthermore, if the Japanese continue to penetrate deeper, their living environment will become increasingly harsh, and the health of the Japanese army will continue to deteriorate. According to Chinese medical circles, there should be no more epidemics in the Chinese army this summer because all Chinese soldiers have been vaccinated in advance. However, last summer, the Chinese army often suffered from epidemics such as malaria, dysentery, and typhoid fever. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Gulangyu Public Works Bureau Protests Japanese Blockade, Food Situation Rapidly Deteriorating, Consular Corps Also Files Separate Protest</h3>
<p>Gulangyu Since the Japanese blockade has been tightened, the food situation in the public concession here has deteriorated rapidly. Residents of the concession are now prohibited from buying food in Xiamen and bringing it back to the concession. The Public Works Bureau here has protested the blockade to the Japanese authorities, and the consular corps has also filed a separate protest to support it. Currently, there is no difficulty in sending food by ship from abroad, so there is no fear of shortage in using this method to supply rice and beans. The blockade of the Gulangyu concession began a week ago, with the Japanese preventing all supplies from being imported from the mainland to the island. The public concession currently has 50,000 residents, and is crowded. (Dispatch of 22nd)</p>

<p>To prevent capital flight and stabilize the financial situation, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated measures to restrict deposit withdrawals. Yesterday, the banking industry held a general meeting and resolved on seven important measures, ordering all banks to comply. Public sentiment has calmed, rumors have subsided, and the financial market is trending toward stability. Although various industries temporarily suspended trading yesterday, they are expected to resume normal operations starting today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Telegram on Restrictions</p>
<p>The Banking Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that due to the recent rush to purchase foreign exchange in Shanghai, causing concerns about capital flight, it is imperative to prevent this in order to stabilize the financial situation. It is hereby stipulated that starting from June 22nd, Shanghai banks, when paying out deposits, except for salary disbursements, the amount withdrawn each week shall be limited to 500 yuan in legal tender. Amounts exceeding 500 yuan shall be paid by remittance, specifically for interbank transfers. Other cities outside of Shanghai shall continue to operate as before. Transfers of deposits to the interior are not subject to this restriction. These measures are intended to maintain the current financial situation in Shanghai. All sectors in Shanghai possess a patriotic spirit and are urged to understand this intention and implement it immediately.</p>
<p>Banking Industry Announcement to Comply</p>
<p>The Banking Association received a joint telegram from Song Ziwen, Qian Xinzhi, and Ye Zhuotang at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Finance was considering measures to prevent the rush to purchase foreign exchange in Shanghai and to avoid capital flight, and urging them to await instructions from the Ministry. It was not until 12:00 PM that afternoon that the telegram from the Ministry of Finance arrived. An emergency meeting was convened at 2:00 PM yesterday. In addition to resolving to comply, a general meeting of the banking industry was convened, gathering all parties. The announcement is as follows: "To all members, we have received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance (see the Ministry's telegram above). All member banks and firms of this association must comply with these regulations. Except for deposits made before August 13th, which will continue to be handled according to the Financial Stability Act, this is a special notice, and compliance is required immediately."</p>
<p>Previously Established Measures Remain Effective</p>
<p>A reporter from the "New Voice" newspaper spoke with Tan Xi of the Banking Association. The Financial Stability Act promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on August 16, 1937, and the supplementary measures approved by the Ministry on August 17, 1937, remain effective. This means that for all current account deposits made since August 16th, and fixed deposits that have matured, if withdrawals are made from the original bank, each household can only withdraw 5% of the remaining balance each week, but each depositor is limited to a maximum withdrawal of 150 yuan in legal tender per week. All bank drafts issued by the banking industry must be stamped with an interbank transfer chop. These instruments are only allowed for interbank transfers within Shanghai and cannot be used to obtain legal tender or purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Two Associations Convened a General Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Banking and Money Exchange Associations convened a general meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Banking Association on Hong Kong Road, inviting member banks and non-member banks to attend. Over a hundred people attended, including Pan Jiufen, Ye Fu, Qin Runqing, Li Fuxun, Xu Jibin, Jin Zongcheng, and Wu Yunzhai. The Secretary-General of the Banking Association, Lin Kanghou, and Secretary Gu Chengan were present. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunzhai, who reported on the telegram from the Ministry of Finance. Discussions then began on the procedures for implementing the restrictions on deposits. The opinions put forward by various banks and money exchanges were compiled into seven items, which were resolved to be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Association for review. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 AM.</p>
<p>Seven Implementation Measures Specified</p>
<p>The Banking and Money Exchange Associations convened a meeting of the Executive Committee at the Banking Club at 11:30 AM yesterday, attended by Wu Yunqi, Xu Jiqing, Li Fuxun, Pan Jiufen, Qin Runqing, Wang Yansong (representing Mao Zhendai), Wu Weiru (representing Wang Zihou), and Ye Fuxiao. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunzhai, with Gu Chengan as the recorder. The various proposals from the general meeting were reviewed, and the meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. According to a reporter from "New Voice," the seven measures are: (1) Bank drafts and transfer orders issued by banks before June 22nd, as well as remittances that have already been notified, can still be withdrawn upon maturity. (2) Checks that matured before June 22nd but have not been cashed will be handled in accordance with the Ministry's order. (3) Legal tender deposited after June 22nd is not subject to the restriction when withdrawn. (4) Interbank deposits will be handled as usual. (5) Fixed deposits made after August 13th can still be used as collateral, and the amounts will be handled according to the previous Financial Stability Act. (6) If depositors are disbursing wages and the amount exceeds 500 yuan, they can also be handled in accordance with the previous Financial Stability Act. (7) [Omitted]</p>
<p>Rumors Subside, Public Sentiment Calms</p>
<p>A financial leader told a reporter from "New Voice" yesterday that the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting deposit withdrawals aims to prevent capital flight and is part of the government's overall wartime financial policy. All citizens should comply with it. Now that all banks and money exchanges in Shanghai have been ordered to comply with the restrictions on deposits, withdrawals have actually decreased compared to before, and the financial market is becoming more stable. Due to the lack of legal tender among speculators, the black market for foreign exchange has ceased to be actively traded, causing prices to rise. Although remittance discounts have disappeared, this is temporary. Citizens are urged to remain calm and not worry. Market rumors have completely subsided since yesterday afternoon, and public sentiment has calmed.</p>
<p>Black Market for Foreign Exchange Slightly Loosens Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the HSBC Bank continued to supply the black market for foreign exchange as much as possible, the market price has become stable. The British pound is at 6.5 pence, and the US dollar is at 12.625 yuan, seemingly reaching a new equilibrium. The black market exchange rate quoted by HSBC Bank yesterday remained unchanged. However, due to the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on deposit withdrawals, the cash position on the market has become increasingly tight, and the general public's ability to purchase foreign exchange has suddenly weakened, causing the exchange rate to loosen. The British pound rose to 6.875 pence, and the US dollar rose to 12.875 yuan. The market suddenly contracted in the afternoon, but it was still looser than the market on Tuesday. The official foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank remains stable as always.</p>
<p>Securities Plunge, Trading Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The unofficial securities market previously fell due to various types of bonds stopping interest payments. Trading resumed as usual yesterday morning after the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. Market rumors persisted, public sentiment was agitated, and the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on deposit withdrawals caused prices to continue to fall. At the morning close, Category A bonds closed at 54.2 yuan, down 2.9 yuan; Category B bonds closed at 47 yuan, down 2.4 yuan; Category C bonds closed at 46.3 yuan, down 2.2 yuan; Category D bonds closed at 45.7 yuan, down 1.1 yuan; and Category E bonds closed at 45.5 yuan, down 2.4 yuan. Trading was temporarily suspended in the afternoon due to unsettled trades. It was also decided to suspend trading tomorrow (23rd) and the day after (24th), and to decide on a reopening date after a meeting of brokers next Monday (26th).</p>
<p>Gold Market Approaching a State of Stagnation</p>
<p>Due to the sudden shortage of cash on the unofficial cash market, speculators have no legal tender to purchase cash, and those holding cash have no way to sell it, so there is no trading and it has approached a state of stagnation. However, there were informal transactions at a price of 2,500 yuan, an increase of 169 yuan compared to Tuesday of last week. The price quoted by gold shops yesterday remained unchanged. Datong Bank's selling price was 270 yuan, and Xintong Bank's selling price was 268 yuan, but the buying price was reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Remittance Discounts Absent Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the remittance system in Shanghai, a discount for exchanging legal tender for remittances has been created, which is handled by small money exchanges. All formal banks and remittance firms refuse to offer this discount. Previously, due to the manipulation of speculators, the discount rate soared. The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee, entrusted by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Communications Bank, intervened to stabilize the remittance discount rate, which stabilized at around 50 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Since the Ministry of Finance restricted deposit withdrawals yesterday, the cash market has been extremely tight, so money exchanges and the Reserve Committee have no market. However, one money exchange was buying at a discount of 75 yuan.</p>
<p>Various Industries Meet to Discuss Reopening Measures</p>
<p>(1) The unofficial yarn and cloth market announced yesterday that it would temporarily suspend trading and reopen after the banking industry decides on remedial measures. (2) The unofficial grain trading market also temporarily suspended trading yesterday. The Grain and Oilseed Industry Association met at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss remedial measures. (3) Yesterday, the cash price for standard number two flour was 4.65 yuan, and remittance transactions were suspended. (4) The Rice Industry also held a meeting yesterday to discuss research. The Qinglian Pavilion market will open as usual today. According to a reporter from "New Voice," the grain, flour, yarn, and cloth markets have resolved the seven measures, and all payment methods have been resolved. It is reported that they can resume normal operations starting today.</p>
<p>Huaxing Bank Suffers a Blow</p>
<p>The pseudo "Reformed Government" established the "Huaxing Bank" in Shanghai on May 15th to disrupt Chinese finance and issued 20 million yuan in counterfeit currency. The capital was prepared with legal tender, but since its establishment, it has not developed much due to a lack of trust. All counterfeit currency is only forcibly used in the Japanese-occupied areas of Hongkou and Zhabei. Since the Ministry of Finance's new deposit restriction measures, it has been unable to obtain a large amount of legal tender. The reserve fund of the pseudo "Huaxing Bank" has been shaken, and the bank's future will suffer a major blow.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Unable to Engage in Foreign Exchange Arbitrage</p>
<p>A reporter from "Daguang News" interviewed leaders of industry and commerce yesterday morning to inquire about the consequences of the Ministry of Finance's new measures. They stated that since the Ministry of Finance implemented these emergency measures, various industries have been unable to obtain large amounts of legal tender and thus unable to purchase foreign goods. Therefore, Japanese merchants in Shanghai are unable to sell a large amount of Japanese goods to obtain legal tender for foreign exchange arbitrage. As a result, Japanese goods in China will be greatly reduced in the future. As for domestic products, merchants will mostly switch to domestic goods because they cannot purchase foreign goods, so sales will inevitably be more prosperous. This will greatly benefit the entire national industry and commerce. However, merchants may feel slightly inconvenienced at the beginning of the new order, but after the widespread use of remittances, they will be the same as legal tender, and various industries have no need to worry.</p>
<p>Financial Situation Stabilizes, Prices Will Fall</p>
<p>According to an economic expert, the Ministry of Finance's telegram is a necessary measure to stabilize the wartime economy. All Chinese people should comply with it without any suspicion. This move will prevent capital flight and make the financial situation more stable. After this new order is implemented, the soaring prices in Shanghai will also likely fall back, which will further benefit the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin Speak of the Suffering of the British, Insulting Situations Abound, Future Prospects are Difficult to See</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the first batch of foreigners arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, who were blockaded in the British and French concessions of Tianjin by the Japanese authorities on the 14th of this month, arrived in port yesterday. When they spoke with reporters, they confirmed that the Tianjin Japanese authorities are imposing the most severe discrimination against British nationals, while Tokyo officials are making contradictory statements. These "refugees" departed on the German "Desheng" ship of the Jardine Matheson Company. Due to turbulent waves at sea, they arrived six hours late, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Although they left Tianjin only two days after the blockade began, they witnessed many "insulting situations" that they could report. They recounted the disrespect shown by Japanese sentries to the British in detail.</p>
<p>British Forced to Remove Their Trousers</p>
<p>Mr. White, a well-known American lace merchant in Tianjin, arrived in Tianjin by train from Peiping three days before the "Desheng" ship set sail. He recounted an extremely unpleasant incident: The first scene that caught his eye when he stepped onto the platform was Japanese sentries removing the clothes of some British people. One British person had already been stripped to the waist and asked the sentry, "Do you want me to take off my trousers?" The sentry replied, "Of course." The British person had no choice but to take off all his clothes.</p>
<p>No Difficulties for Americans</p>
<p>A Japanese soldier asked Mr. White what his nationality was. Mr. White replied that he was American and showed his passport as proof. The sentry did not make things difficult and allowed him to pass. However, Mr. White had to pay five yuan for a taxi ride that only took five minutes to reach his hotel.</p>
<p>Separate Entrances for Chinese and Foreigners in Cinemas</p>
<p>According to passengers arriving in Shanghai, when they boarded the ship to leave Tianjin last Friday, the city was in a state of extreme tension. Even before the actual blockade began, the situation was far from normal. For example, since the shooting incident at the Great Light Cinema, Chinese and foreigners going to the cinema had to enter through separate doors. Chinese people were thoroughly searched before being allowed to enter. Although the situation in Tianjin was quite difficult, foreign authorities had advised residents not to attempt to leave the country, fearing that they would encounter unfortunate incidents with Japanese sentries on their journey.</p>
<p>Difficulties Encountered When Leaving Tianjin by Ferry</p>
<p>The passengers left the British concession waterfront by ferry at 12:30 PM last Friday and sailed down the river to Tanggu, where they transferred to the "Desheng" ship. Japanese soldiers once stopped the ferry, but after inspecting several passports and questioning them briefly, they allowed the ferry to continue its journey. The delay lasted a total of one hour. They arrived at the coast at 6:30 PM and boarded the "Desheng" ship, which departed for Shanghai at 1:00 PM on the next day.</p>
<p>Difficulties for Tianjin Prospects</p>
<p>The "Desheng" ship did not encounter any incidents with Japanese soldiers but encountered a storm on Tuesday, causing a delay of six hours before arriving in Shanghai. According to the opinions of most of the arrivals interviewed by reporters, the situation in Tianjin is unlikely to improve in the near future. One woman said that she could not bear to stay in Tianjin. She expressed her dissatisfaction with the actions of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>International Moral Re-Armament Meeting in America</h3>
<p>Shanghai Delegation to Depart This Week</p>
<p>Last June, when international tensions were extremely high and countries were urgently rearming, Christian figure Frank Buchman broadcast in London, launching the Moral Re-Armament movement, advocating sincerity, purity, unselfishness, and love as the basis for resolving various disputes. Many members of the British House of Lords and House of Commons, as well as former Prime Minister Baldwin, sent letters to</p>
<p>The Times</p>
<p>endorsing Buchman's ideas. Subsequently, leaders from various circles in Europe and America responded, and it has now become a global Moral Re-Armament movement. This month marks the one-year anniversary of the movement, and US President Roosevelt also sent a letter of support. As reported previously, an International Moral Re-Armament Conference will be held in Los Angeles, California, in July.</p>
<p>Representatives from All Countries</p>
<p>will attend. From China, it is reported that a delegation of eight people from Shanghai, including Diao Xinde, Tang Renxi, Wang Wanbai, and young people Ms. Deng, Mr. Cai, Mr. Tang, and Westerners Mrs. May and Mr. Duley, will travel to the United States to attend the conference. They will depart from Shanghai on the Russian Empress this Sunday and are expected to return to China after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Last night at 8:30 PM, the delegation gave an English broadcast on the Gospel Radio Station, reporting on their trip to the conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Do Not Guarantee the Safety of Foreigners in Shantou, British Embassy Notifies Shantou Office Not to Encourage Britons to Leave Shantou</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great Evening News" reports that an official from the British Embassy stated today (22nd) that the Japanese authorities have announced that after 1:00 PM tomorrow (23rd), they cannot guarantee the safety of third-country nationals in Shantou. The British Embassy has already notified the British Consul in Shantou not to encourage Britons to leave the city. Three British merchant ships that were docked in Shantou yesterday (21st) have now sailed to Hong Kong. The British warship "Sennart" and the US destroyer "Pillsbury" are still docked in Shantou. There are many British and American expatriates in the area. The Swire company's "Yingzhou" is currently docked in Shantou.</p>

Medium and lower grades shall be reduced accordingly. Any transactions exceeding these price limits will not be recognized as valid, and the police should be informed truthfully for investigation and handling. The above provisions will be posted on a notice at the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association market this morning (Friday) to inform all rice merchants to comply. In addition, the Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday, at which time there will be discussions on further reducing rice prices and smoothing the source of national rice.</p>

Haulter Vice Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited representatives of the rice industry groups Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Nianxuan, and Fu Qiangeng to discuss the rice price issue in the Shanghai rice market at 2:00 PM yesterday. He also informed the rice industry representatives that the Concession authorities have established measures to limit rice prices, hoping to instruct all rice industry firms to comply with the measures. Those who violate the price limits set by the authorities should be reported truthfully for investigation and handling. The Concession authorities have sent personnel to conduct strict investigations and suppress those who speculate and manipulate the rice market. Measures have been established to maintain the people's food supply within the Concessions. The representatives left at about 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of the Bean and Rice Industry</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Grain Industry Association held a joint emergency meeting of the Executive Committee at the Association's office on Avenue Edward VII at 5:00 PM yesterday, attended by Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, Yu Bingwen, Zhu Xiangsheng, and Xing Zhigang. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. Members of the Market Management Committee Wang Tianqiu, Zhang Lizhong, Zhou Zhizhen, Yin Fuxiang, and Gu Yisheng were present as observers. First, Chen Ziyi reported on his negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council, and then discussions began on the case of limiting rice prices to maintain the people's food supply, as instructed by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council. It was resolved to comply with the intentions of the authorities of the two concessions. Sales made before June 28, 1939, will still be calculated at the original transaction prices. Starting from June 23rd, the maximum rice price will be limited to 21 yuan per picul for the highest grade glutinous rice and 17 yuan per picul for the highest grade xiangke rice, with medium and lower grades reduced accordingly. A notice will be posted at the market for all to comply with.</p>
<p>Notice Posted at the Market for All to Comply</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association posted a notice at the Qinglian Pavilion market this morning stating, "In recent days, rice prices have soared, exceeding normal levels and greatly affecting the people's livelihood. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, in order to maintain the people's food supply, have convened representatives of this association to discuss the matter and have decided to limit rice prices. From today (sales made before June 28, 1939, will be calculated at the original transaction prices), the maximum glutinous rice price, whether wholesale or retail, shall not exceed 21 yuan per picul, and the maximum xiangke rice price shall not exceed 17 yuan per picul, with medium and lower grades reduced accordingly.

<p>Market Opens at 9:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>A reporter from "New Voice" met with Fu Qiangeng, director of the Market Management Committee, yesterday. According to him, the Market Management Committee originally planned to convene a meeting of all firms at 3:00 PM on the 22nd to advise them to maintain the people's food supply and lower rice prices. Because the Bean and Rice Industry Association had already convened an emergency meeting to decide on price limits and issued a notice for all to comply with, the meeting to convene all firms was temporarily cancelled. As for the Bean and Rice Market, it will open at 9:00 AM this morning (22nd), and all transactions must be conducted in accordance with the new price limits of the Concession authorities. Those who exceed the price limits will be strictly dealt with by the Concession authorities, so the rice price in Shanghai can be stabilized thereafter.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Ship Attempts to Sail to Shantou, Itinerary Determined Temporarily, If Not Allowed to Enter, It Will Change Course to Hong Kong, Transportation Between Hong Kong and Shantou Has Been Announced to Be Interrupted</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army landed near Shantou on the morning of the 21st, transportation between Shanghai and Shantou is still maintained by foreign ships as usual. Jardine Matheson's "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships both departed yesterday afternoon, but whether they can reach their destination is still difficult to predict. A reporter from "Daguang News" has investigated and reported the following:</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Ships Sail to Shantou as Usual</p>
<p>After the Japanese army landed in Shantou, telecommunications were disrupted, and all parties in the city have not yet received official news from the area. The details are unknown. In order to maintain transportation between Shanghai and Shantou, Jardine Matheson still had its "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships sail as usual. The "Zesheng" departed first at 2:30 PM yesterday, and the "Desheng" departed at 6:00 PM. Both ships were fully loaded with cotton cloth, groceries, etc., but there were few passengers.</p>
<p>Whether They Can Arrive Is Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>Although the "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships have departed, whether they can reach Shantou is still a question and difficult to predict. According to a staff member of Jardine Matheson, if the situation in Shantou is bad and prevents the "Desheng" and "Zesheng" ships from entering the port, they will change course to Hong Kong to unload their cargo. Taikoo's Nanhua class has stopped calling at Shantou from today onwards. However, Jardine Matheson's shipping schedule issued yesterday still had the words "Nanhua class also calls at Shantou."</p>
<p>Transportation Between Hong Kong and Shantou Temporarily Interrupted</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the "Hesheng" ship of Jardine Matheson, which travels between Hong Kong and Shantou, sailed directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 21st and is expected to arrive in port on the morning of the 25th. There were also many temporary ticket refunds in Shantou. Transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou has been temporarily interrupted. When navigation will be restored depends on the situation.</p>
<p>Ships Blocked in Hong Kong Port</p>
<p>The Taikoo company's "Suiyang" and "Manly Maller" and other ships, which were blocked from entering the port in Shantou, have sailed to Hong Kong and unloaded passengers and cargo in Hong Kong warehouses. The ships telegraphed their companies in the city to report the details. Jardine Matheson's "New Yisheng" ship received a telegram from the Hong Kong office the day before yesterday, ordering it to withdraw from Shantou, so the ship left Shantou for Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 21st, and the goods in Shantou were not unloaded.</p>
<p>Southwest Mail to Be Rerouted</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the war in Shantou, the Shanghai Postal Administration telegraphed the Shantou Postal Bureau yesterday to inquire about the truth of the local situation. As of 5:00 PM yesterday, no reply had been received. According to a reporter from "New Voice," regarding Shantou's transit and exchange business, the Postal Remittance Bureau stated that although it is still issuing drafts as usual before receiving a reply from the other side, all responsibility must be borne by the remitter, and the Bureau is not responsible. However, the Bureau is ultimately cautious and will return the remittance to the original place if it cannot be delivered. As for parcels, they were still being accepted and sent as usual yesterday, but they will be stopped within a few days. All kinds of mail will be maintained in their original state as much as possible, and the Bureau will definitely not stop receiving and sending them. In addition, mail to the southwestern provinces and cities, which was previously routed through Shantou because there is a highway connecting Shantou to Qujiang, is being considered by the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Postal Bureau due to the Shantou incident. It will be rerouted through Haiphong and Hong Kong. It is reported that various merchants have automatically stopped sending parcels transiting through Shantou.</p>
<h3>Managing Director of Taikoo Trading Company in Britain Donates 5,000 Pounds, Approximately 185,000 Chinese Yuan, to the Relief Fund for the Suffering of China</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st - The resident Director of John Swire and Sons Limited (China Navigation Co. Ltd.) of Shanghai, has donated Five Thousand Pounds towards the “United Aid to China Fund”. In addition donations of general commodities purchased through a gift by the British Co-Operative Associations valued at One Thousand Pounds were also recently donated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspectors Confiscate Mail, Foreigners Highly Indignant, Loss of Mail Containing Funds, American Resident Suggests US Retaliation via Postal Service</h3>
<p>The "Millard's Review" reports that in Tianjin, Beijing, and Fuzhou, only the pro-Japanese "Shanghai Times" is able to receive Shanghai newspapers through the mail. All other publications are being confiscated by Japanese inspectors in the Shanghai Post Office. The Chinese Post Office has been prohibiting the mailing of the British-owned "Tianjin Times" for months now. Only one copy, addressed to the British Embassy in Beijing, is not confiscated because inspecting mail to embassies or consulates would violate diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>All</p>
<p>civilized nations</p>
<p>respect diplomatic immunity, except for a certain Eastern country whose name need not be mentioned. Furthermore, mail from foreign countries is also being intercepted. Hundreds of copies of the August issue of the "Reader's Digest" were confiscated because it reprinted Pearl S. Buck's article claiming that China would ultimately triumph. A book titled "History of the U.S. Marine Corps," ordered by the Shanghai-based U.S. Marine Corps, was also stolen by a Japanese inspector. Books by Professor Rice Weir of Chicago about</p>
<p>propaganda techniques</p>
<p>have also been confiscated. Some suspect that the inspectors' motives go beyond simply preventing foreigners from gaining perspectives that contradict Japan's. This suspicion has been confirmed after it was proven that mail containing funds has also been lost. Discerning individuals have decided not to entrust mail to the Shanghai Post Office, instead opting to send it directly via shipping vessels or have it carried to Hong Kong for mailing to avoid Japanese inspection. Foreign consular officials have lodged strong protests against this abuse of authority, but with little effect. Therefore, some American residents have recently suggested retaliating against Japan through the American postal service.</p>
<h3>Admiral Yarnell Travels to Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>Travels in Special Train, Accompanied by Officers' Families</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports from this port city that Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, traveled to Qinhuangdao yesterday (the 21st) from Tianjin on a specially prepared train. He boarded the flagship USS Augusta. Ten wives and twelve children of U.S. Marine Corps officers and soldiers stationed in Tianjin also traveled on Yarnell's special train, departing from the Tianjin concession to Qinhuangdao. From there, with Yarnell's assistance, they will travel to Shanghai by merchant or military vessel. The USS Augusta is scheduled to arrive in Qingdao on the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador on Jewish Refugee</h3>
<p>Resettlement Question</p>
<p>Had No Prior Knowledge, Nor Participated in Planning</p>
<p>The German Ambassador to China claims that he had no prior knowledge of the discussions between the German banker and industrialist, Mr. Porglas, and high-ranking Chinese government officials regarding the resettlement of 100,000 Jewish refugees. These discussions concern opening a "New Promised Land" in Yunnan, permitting immigrants to come to China with rights of residence, work, and protection from the Chinese government, according to a plan drafted by Mr. Porglas. The Ambassador stated he had only heard of this plan for the first time after it was publicly announced.</p>
<h3>Japanese Notify Third-Country Vessels of Yangtze River Estuary Blockade, Claim Guerrilla Activity, Sino-Japanese Troops Have Clashed at the Mouth of the River</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that a Japanese naval spokesman stated last night (the 21st) that the Japanese naval authorities requested on Sunday that third-country vessels refrain from navigating the Yangtze River north of Chongming Island due to impending combat operations against guerrillas. This warning was issued in light of the guerrilla activity in Lingdian, where an estimated 100 regular Chinese soldiers were entrenched in fortifications. On the 2nd of this month, a Japanese patrol vessel</p>
<p>briefly shelled</p>
<p>these positions. Shortly thereafter, the British gunboat HMS Gnat and another vessel stopped in the area. On the 5th of this month, a Japanese patrol vessel returned to Lingdian and, upon observing over a hundred guerrillas there, signaled its intention to open fire. The Japanese vessel escorted HMS Gnat and other vessels away before engaging in a clash lasting one hour. The guerrillas were levying taxes on goods being loaded onto foreign vessels to fund their operations, and because they seemed to be</p>
<p>receiving supplies</p>
<p>from these vessels, the Japanese military found it necessary to blockade the Yangtze River north of Chongming Island until these elements were driven out. It is also dangerous for third-country vessels to enter the crossfire. The spokesman continued, stating that on Tuesday, a unit of the Japanese naval landing force clashed with strong regular Chinese forces near a river port along the Yangtze River, resulting in "slight casualties" for the Japanese military.</p>

<h3>Export Volume Increased Compared to Before the War, National Tea Sales Flourishing, New Tea Regions Opened in Southwest Provinces, Machine-Made Tea Production Successful</h3>
<p>Since the government began promoting the export of domestic goods, national tea sales have been flourishing. The export volume has even increased compared to before the war. New tea regions have been opened in the southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, etc., to increase production. Machine-made tea production has been successful. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exports Increased</p>
<p>After the War</p>
<p>The Foreign Trade Commission, upon receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance, controls all tea leaves nationwide, and cooperates with the Fuhua Company to be responsible for purchasing and exporting matters in local markets throughout the country. For the entire past year, a total of 800,000 boxes of tea leaves were purchased, of which it is estimated that half were sold in various countries' markets. Another 264,000 boxes were transported abroad to exchange for war and construction materials. In addition, a large number of red brick tea and green brick tea were sold to the Soviet Union. According to the export volume of Chinese tea leaves, it was 30,787,274 yuan in national currency in 1937, but last year it increased to 33,094,085 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>New Tea Regions</p>
<p>Opened in Southwest Provinces</p>
<p>Recently, in order to increase the production of tea leaves for export and to replenish foreign exchange reserves, the government has opened up new tea regions in the southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Xikang, and Guizhou, and has dispatched technical personnel to conduct surveys and proceed with the work. New tea from the provinces that have not been occupied have already begun to enter the market, and the Fuhua Company is still responsible for unified purchases. Due to favorable weather conditions and advances in cultivation techniques, it is expected that exports will increase even more than last year.</p>
<p>Machine-Made Tea</p>
<p>Production is Good</p>
<p>In order to develop the tea industry, banks are actively providing loans to tea farmers and tea merchants. The Farmers Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have cooperated with provincial banks and local banks, and have tentatively set the total loan amount at 20 million yuan in national currency to help support development. Currently, many inland tea factories are also experimenting with machine-made tea, and are equipped with new-style machinery, such as engines, kneading machines, loosening machines, and screening machines. The results are quite good.</p>
<h3>Houjiazhai on Route Haig Forms a Light Industrial Area, Light Industrial Manufacturers Are Concentrated Here, but Worsening Vicious Business Practices Are Rampant</h3>
<p>Houjiazhai on Route Haig, located behind the Chinese Funeral Home, is only a stone's throw from Dongfahua Town. Originally a small village in the Fahua district, it had fewer than a hundred households. The surrounding fields were extremely desolate. After the "August 13th" Incident, the village, being next to the road built beyond the boundaries of the International Settlement, was enclosed within a wire netting, and gradually gained attention. Following the westward retreat of the Chinese army and the fall of the suburbs, the provinces, cities, and counties that were occupied were ravaged by the iron hooves of the Japanese army, and beset by bandits, making it impossible for people to live and work in peace. They fled to the isolated island, causing Shanghai's population to increase from three million to five million. This remote village was also sought after. In the past year, Houjiazhai has transformed from a village into a town. Currently, there are more businesses than houses, and stores are lined up one after another. The desolate suburbs of the past have become bustling city streets. Housing prices are increasing day by day, and the market is developing rapidly. Various light industries, such as towel factories, bakelite factories, leather factories, cotton batting factories, eyeglass lens workshops, eyeglass frame workshops, wicker and wooden comb manufacturing workshops, and electrical engineering workshops, are concentrated here, forming a light industrial production area. The leaders of the village pay attention to the construction of municipal facilities. The roads, which used to be rugged and muddy, are now paved with stones, like wide and level avenues. Other facilities, such as street lights, have also been gradually installed. Unfortunately, because the village is located in the area where roads are built beyond the boundaries of the International Settlement, it is under the jurisdiction of the puppet regime, and all kinds of vicious business practices are allowed to run rampant unchecked.</p>
<h3>Area West of Shanghai Becomes Tense Again</h3>
<p>North Xinjing Ferry Suspended, Gunfire Heard in the Southwest Corner</p>
<p>The situation in the area west of Shanghai has been quite chaotic since the 18th. The Japanese army is on high alert. Villagers in the area west of Shanghai who usually travel to the International Settlement via the North Xinjing ferry as the only convenient route, were unable to cross the ferry on the morning of the 19th, causing many passengers to be stranded. A large number of ships sailing from inland areas to Shanghai were also blocked in the Yejidun area west of North Xinjing. According to a rice vendor who managed to bypass North Xinjing and travel to Shanghai (this rice vendor usually traveled between Shanghai and the northwest of Xinjing to sell rice in small quantities, and was blocked in North Xinjing this time due to the ferry suspension), from the evening of the 18th, small cannon and dense machine gun fire was heard every day and night in the area west of Shanghai. The gunfire seemed to be coming from the Hongqiao Airport and Sijing and Qibao areas in the southwest. It is rumored that there are guerrilla battles in those areas, and the Japanese army is on high alert, announcing temporary martial law and searching households very strictly. Pedestrians on the road are all subjected to strict searches and interrogations. Residents are frightened several times a night, and almost all dare not go out. Customers in tea houses have disappeared, and business in restaurants and dim sum shops is also very quiet. Because vegetable vendors cannot transport vegetables into the International Settlement, they have to sell them at low prices, so vegetable prices in the town of North Xinjing have been unusually low in recent days.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Japanese Police Officers Begin Training</h3>
<p>Twenty-seven Japanese police officers, who arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the 8th of this month, have joined the police department for six months of training. Upon completion, they will be formally promoted to police officers. It is reported that the ages of these Japanese police officers are between 21 and 30 years old.</p>
<h3>New British River Gunboat Sails to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that the second new British river gunboat HMS Dragonfly is quietly sailing along the coast from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The HMS Dragonfly was built in England and arrived in Hong Kong several weeks ago. It has already undergone trials. HMS Grasshopper, of the same class, followed HMS Dragonfly to Hong Kong and is currently undergoing trials. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai after mid-next month. In addition, HMS Scorpion, the first new British river gunboat, took over as flagship of the Yangtze River Fleet several months ago and, after patrolling the lower Yangtze River, is scheduled to return to this port tomorrow (the 23rd).</p>
<h3>Two Tea Drinkers Kidnapped from Jinhua Teahouse on Hualong Road, Forced into Car and Driven Away, Identities of Those Kidnapped Not Yet Ascertained</h3>
<p>The Jinhua Teahouse at 80 Hualong Road in the French Concession is a branch of the Jinhua Sichuan Restaurant on Rue Wagner. It mainly sells tea and dim sum, and also offers meals, making it an economical restaurant. The interior is elegantly decorated, and the space is spacious, making it popular among middle and upper class people. In the afternoons, after school, the teahouse is very busy, as students often stop by for a snack on their way home. Therefore, the teahouse has gained a great reputation shortly after its opening. Moreover, because it is located near the French Park, business is even better in the summer.</p>
<p>Two Customers, One Fat, One Thin</p>
<p>At around 7 PM yesterday, two customers, one fat and one thin, both in their thirties, speaking Cantonese and wearing Western-style suits, came to the teahouse for dinner. They were served by waiter Fei Baosheng, number 45, and seated at table number 22. The two customers first ordered two bottles of soda and selected several dishes.</p>
<p>Four More Arrive, Take Two</p>
<p>Just as the two men were drinking water and chatting, before ten minutes had passed, four more men in Western suits walked in. They went straight to the two customers' table, said a few words, and the two customers were taken out by the four men. At the time, everyone in the teahouse thought that the men were friends and had gone out to talk, so they did not pay attention.</p>
<p>Forced into Car, Speed Away</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after the six men went out, the four who had arrived later forced the two customers into a car that was parked by the side of the road. At this time, the two men tried to resist, but it was too late, and they were forced into the car together, which sped north and disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>Police Assistance Too Late</p>
<p>At the time, a police officer directing traffic at the entrance of the French Park noticed a crowd gathering on the road, and went forward to inquire and offer assistance, but the car had already driven away without a trace. After inquiring at the teahouse, he finally understood what had happened. However, neither the nearby pedestrians nor the police officer noticed the car's license plate number.</p>
<p>Names of Two Customers Not Yet Ascertained</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, there were a total of two ordinary sedan cars and one motorcycle with a sidecar parked by the side of the road at the time. When the car carrying the kidnapped men drove away, the other two cars also followed. However, it is difficult to determine whether there was a connection between the three cars. The police officer immediately reported the incident to the police station by telephone, and the police chief immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene for a detailed investigation. However, the names of the two customers had not yet been ascertained as of the time of this newspaper's publication.</p>
<h3>Capture of Robbery Gang, Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>Detectives Shang Wu and Shen Dehui of the Huishi Police Station arrested three robbers from Ningbo, Wang Shengrong, Wu Hongmao, and Feng Shanqing, at a garret at 24 Tiantong Road, 34 Xinzha Road, and the Dazhong Hotel on Avenue Edward VII on the morning of the day before yesterday. They confiscated stolen goods such as gold rings, diamond rings, and gold bracelets, worth several thousand yuan, and took them all into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the robbery case at the home of Zhong Liu, a resident of Lane 24, No. 830 Tiantong Road, was the result of inside information provided by the defendant Wang Shengrong, and requested an extension of the investigation. After Judge Jiang questioned the three defendants, he ordered them to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Gang Rape of Friend's Wife, Then Forced into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Re-scheduling of Interrogation After Arrest</p>
<p>Chen Jigen and Liu Muhai (peddlers) from Danyang, on the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at No. 27 Anyi Village, North Xizang Road, lured Liu Sun (age 21), wife of their fellow townsman Liu Yaocai (age 23, carpenter) to Aido Hotel and Xincheng Hotel on Rue Brenier, and gang-raped her for three days and nights. On the 17th, they took Liu Sun to a brothel operated by a woman from Yangzhou, Zhao Guannian, at No. 40, Lane 161 Xiamen Road and forced her to receive clients. After Liu Sun went missing, Liu Yaocai reported the case to the Huishi Police Station, requesting the investigation of abduction. Before noon the other day, Chen and Liu suddenly went to Liu Yaocai's house and claimed that they saw Sun being hidden in a certain place and that 70 yuan was needed to redeem her. Liu, hearing this, knew that they were heavily involved and pretended to agree to the 70 yuan, promising to pay it after seeing Sun. Chen and Liu believed him and immediately led Liu Yaocai to Xiamen Road to meet Sun. Liu excused himself to go back and get the money, but instead notified the police station to send detectives to the scene to arrest the two defendants, Chen and Liu. They also arrested suspects Chen Haijin, Shi Yingen, Zhao Guannian, Sun Yuemei, Yang Yuanyuan (members of a guide company), Lu Cuibao, and Zhang Lanying (prostitutes). This morning, they were all escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for interrogation. Judge Jiang, after a brief interrogation, ordered Sun Yuemei, Yang Yuanyuan, Lu Cuibao, and Zhang Lanying to be released on bail pending further investigation, and the remaining defendants to be detained.</p>
<h3>Fighting at a Birthday Party, Guests Get Drunk and Become Violent</h3>
<p>Hao Jinkui (age 37) from Rugao, residing at No. 41 Fahua Town West of Shanghai, held a birthday party at home at noon yesterday for his mother's 60th birthday. Many relatives and friends attended. At around 2 PM, Hao's good friends Gao Jinsheng (age 27) and Tong Mingyang (age 31) drank too much and got into a dispute. Both sides used vegetable basins to strike each other, resulting in head injuries and bloodshed. Hao stepped forward to mediate, but was also injured in the head and face. Afterwards, the family took the three injured parties to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Collecting Scrap Metal in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The waste copper and scrap metal in the ruins of Zhabei, except for the parts that were relatively complete and had already been removed, still have some old lead sheets and other scrap metal piled up everywhere. A large number of workers are dispatched every day to collect them, tie them with lead wire, and load them to the large open space in Yangshupu. It is said that tens of millions of tons of scrap metal have been collected. The more complete iron parts are piled up in various buildings, waiting to be transported out one after another. Therefore, residents living in Hongkou and Zhabei are not allowed to carry copper or iron to the International Settlement, otherwise it will be very dangerous if discovered.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Suffers Intense Heat Yesterday, High of 95.5 Degrees, Horse Collapses from Heatstroke, Epidemic Hospital Overcrowded</h3>
<p>The weather in this port city was scorching hot yesterday, with no relief in sight. The blazing sun scorched all day, causing extreme irritability. According to the records of the Xujiahui Observatory, the highest temperature in Shanghai reached 95.5 degrees before 3 PM yesterday. The heat wave was intense, and the entire city felt like it was boiling. The temperature the day before yesterday was only 90.01 degrees, so yesterday's increase was a staggering 5.4 degrees. The highest temperature on the same day last year was only 75.2 degrees, which is even more different. On the 9th of this month, the heat in this port city also reached 95.5 degrees, but the duration of the high heat was not as long as yesterday's. Yesterday, a horse-drawn carriage collapsed on Route Connaught West of Shanghai due to the horse suffering from heatstroke, and was unable to carry passengers to their destination. The horse lay on the ground for a long time before recovering, and the owner hired a truck to carry it back. The asphalt on the road melted, making it difficult to walk, and this was seen everywhere. The epidemic hospital was also overflowing with patients.</p>
<h3>Fraud of U.S. Dollars, Lawyer Yao Ruilian, Forged Checks, Yong'an Bank Employee Testifies, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentence Scheduled</h3>
<p>In addition to practicing law, lawyer Yao Ruilian also established the Yong'an Bank in the Harding Building on Nanjing Road. In November of last year, the bank experienced financial difficulties and colluded with a certain bank employee, Chen Lingmei, to design a scheme to defraud the Bao Tai Bank on Sichuan Road of 1,500 U.S. dollars. The case was discovered, and Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Detective Zhou Kaiwen of the General Police Department arrested Yao and Chen, along with Chen's mistress, former Mainland Dance Hall dancer Shen Lili, as well as Zhang Zhaohan and Liu Gengsun, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. The case has been</p>
<p>interrogated twice,</p>
<p>as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Meng took the bench in the First Criminal Court to continue the hearing of this case. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that there were two checks. During the previous hearing, the defendant Yao Ruilian denied that they were issued by her. During the adjournment, the police sent detectives to the Yong'an Bank to investigate. According to the bank accountant, Jin Muzhou, the check No. 122034 was indeed issued by Yao on his instructions. It has</p>
<p>two seals</p>
<p>on it, one is "Huikang" and one is "Jiang Wen..." It was found that Jiang works at the Victoria Food Company on Jing'an Temple Road and has dealings with Yong'an Bank. Because Jiang pledged his passbook and account registration seal to Yao Ruilian for 50 yuan, Yao had to keep Jiang's seal as a security measure, so the seal was privately stamped by Yao. However, Huikang is a fictitious number and does not exist. Another check for 600 yuan could not be verified because Yao refused to acknowledge it. Subsequently, witnesses Jin Muzhou and Jiang Wensheng, etc.,</p>
<p>reported to the authorities</p>
<p>and provided evidence. With the case's facts clarified on court, it was ordered to begin the final arguments. After the final arguments between police lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendant's lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, the court agent, student Xuehai, requested the court rule and order the defendants to jointly compensate 1,500 U.S. dollars. Judge Meng then ordered the conclusion of the final arguments and scheduled the sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>

<h3>Rampant Issuance of Bad Checks, Deceptive Tactics Employed, "Slick Operators" Inflict Harm, Legitimate Merchants Should Be Vigilant</h3>
<p>Recently, there are many "slick operator" business fronts in the market, specializing in defrauding people of goods using deceptive tactics. Legitimate merchants are easily deceived if they are not careful. These swindlers often order goods from various colleagues, giving them bad checks from certain banks (because it is extremely easy to open accounts at these banks, no guarantee is required, you can open a check account with 50 yuan, and there are also gifts). When the due date arrives, the checks cannot be</p>
<p>cashed due to insufficient funds.</p>
<p>If the creditor negotiates with the company, they find that it has closed its doors. Chen Yaoxiang is one of these types of individuals. On March 4 of this year, he colluded with his accomplices Qiu Zixin and Cao Yicheng to set up a "slick operator" business front, the Housheng Cotton Cloth Company, at No. 12 Yingchunfang, Lane 203, Hubei Road. However, in the span of two months, due to poor business, they experienced financial difficulties. By the beginning of June, these individuals began to</p>
<p>employ deceptive tactics</p>
<p>to target various cotton cloth merchants. It is estimated that 17 people were deceived, all of whom were fellow villagers from Tongzhou. These fellow villagers bring cloth from their hometown to Shanghai to sell for small profits. Now they sell the cloth to Housheng Cloth Company, and what they get in return are bad checks from certain banks. On the afternoon of June 6, this company</p>
<p>used tactics</p>
<p>to deceive the Tongtai Cloth Company on Ningbo Road out of 40 bolts of cloth. On the same afternoon at 5 PM, they took it to the Guanglifeng Pawnshop on Caishi Street in the French Concession to pawn it. At the same time, they hired lawyer Zhou Liangfu to publish a declaration in the newspaper on June 7 announcing their impending liquidation. When the Tongtai Company found out about this, they reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Zhang Bingying conducted an investigation.</p>
<p>The Prosecution</p>
<p>Sued According to Law</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they requested that the First Special Court issue a summons. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai presided over a collective hearing. The defendants Qiu Zixin and others were absent. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the details of the case and requested a postponement. The court ordered that the defendants be arrested and brought to court for further review.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Caught</h3>
<p>Two Detained by Japanese Army, Hand Grenade Seized</p>
<p>Huatamu Feng Qishan of the General Inspectorate, having learned that a gang of thieves was hiding at No. 14 Shanjia Garden Lane, Rue de Klein, and were in possession of dangerous articles, informed Huatamu Fan Defu and Huatamu Jiang Shangpei, Yang Peisheng, Zhu Wanjun, Tian Changyuan, Peng Bingsheng, and others. The assembled police rushed to the address fully armed yesterday, and successfully apprehended Ningbo natives Zhao Ayou, Zhao Hongqing, Jin Yunquan, Cao Sufa, Mao Yuxing, Zhang Baogen, Wang A Yao, Yu Wenchang, Wang Ruxing, and female Zhao Aizhen. A hand grenade was confiscated from their possession. After questioning, it was discovered that another Jiangbei native, Wu Jinsheng, had been apprehended at Avenue Haig. From Wu, it was learned that more accomplices were hiding at No. 7 Rue Robert, and that they had a large amount of military supplies hidden there. In response, the assembled police officers rushed to the address with members of the Japanese military police, and captured two Jiangbei natives, Wang Yongzhen and Liu Tong (nicknamed "Little Cobbler"). They were immediately detained by the Japanese military police. Yesterday morning, except for Wang and Liu, the remaining suspects were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baozhen stated that the defendants had confessed to committing numerous theft cases at the police station, and that there were still two suspects at large, and that the case had not yet been filed. He requested that the suspects be temporarily detained for further investigation. After questioning the defendants, Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered all defendants to be detained and re-interrogated at a later date.</p>
<h3>A Female Refugee Reduced to Beggary, Kidnapped into a Brothel, and a Thug Attempting Extortion: All Detained and Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Liu Jindi, an 18-year-old woman from Yixing, came to Shanghai from her hometown this spring and lived a hard life at a refugee camp on Jessfield Road. Recently, the camp was closed down, leaving Liu homeless and forced to beg. She spent her days begging in the Xiaoshaba Road area and sleeping in the alleys at night. On the 12th of this month, Liu was led by two elderly female companions to the Zhiji Lane, No. 8, Zhabei Road brothel run by Hu Peizhen, a native of Zhenjiang in the Public Concession, and her concubine, Wang Guibao, to begin a life as a prostitute.</p>
<p>Forced to Receive Customers</p>
<p>Later, because Liu developed a urinary incontinence, in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 8 PM, the madam Wang Guibao instructed the thug Jin Linbao and Jin Asan, both from Shaoxing, to take her to the Zhenji Teahouse on Xiaoshadu Road, opened by her fellow townsman Shi Jinquan, and falsely accuse him of kidnapping and selling Liu to the Zhabei Road No. 8 brothel to work as a prostitute, demanding 200 yuan. Unable to get the money, they started arguing, and were caught by the Chinese detective Tan Jinhai,</p>
<p>Who Investigated the Matter</p>
<p>The two Jins were arrested, and Hu Peizhen and Wang Guibao were also apprehended from the Zhabei Road No. 8 brothel, along with Wang Fengxian, a 21-year-old woman from Yangzhou. (It was discovered that this woman had been working as a factory worker at the Shenxin Mill, No. 140 on Macau Road, and was abducted into the brothel by a man named Shen Xiaowangzi, who is still at large, after having received one customer.) All were taken to the Putuo Road police station.</p>
<p>Detained Separately</p>
<p>The two women were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute (rescue home for women), and were sent to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case and requested investigation. After interrogating the defendants, Judge Jiang Shuzi found the facts to be clear and ordered the four male and female defendants to be detained pending sentencing at a later date. Liu Jindi was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Chinese Detective Chief Zhu Hanbo and Detective Cui Jinchuan of the Gordon Road Police Station previously apprehended the gang of robbers Du Longxing, Chen Chenglong, Jin Asan, and Li Xiaolaohan. Two pistols were confiscated. It was discovered that Du and the others had committed crimes such as armed gang extortion, murder, and robbery in the concession. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, and lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station filed a lawsuit according to the law. The trial was held multiple times. In addition to admitting to the charges, the defendants also confessed that Rang San was the mastermind behind the case. The court trial concluded, and Judge Liu Yugui pronounced the sentences in the Second Criminal Tribunal yesterday morning. Du Longxing was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for continuous extortion and kidnapping. Chen Chenglong was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for associating with others and carrying weapons to commit robbery. He was found not guilty of murder. Jin Asan was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for continuously associating with others, carrying weapons, and breaking into residences at night to commit robbery. He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for continuous attempted murder. The combined sentence was twelve years of imprisonment. He was found not guilty on other charges. Li Xiaolaohan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for associating with others, carrying weapons, and breaking into residences at night to commit robbery. All pistols and bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Middle-Aged Woman Not Content at Home: Xia Maofu Kills His Wife, a Single Knife Wound to the Abdomen Causes Intestines to Spill Out</h3>
<p>Xia Maofu, a 44-year-old man from the Touzhen of Dachang Temple, married Qian, who is now 37 years old. They came to Shanghai to take refuge after the "August 13th" incident and lived together in a bungalow in Putuo Fang. After the National Army retreated westward, Xia often traveled between Shanghai and his hometown. His wife, Qian, despite being middle-aged, was promiscuous. She recently became involved with Ge Yuzhen, who worked as a carpenter. Seeing that Xia was away, Ge took his place and had an affair with her. Recently, Xia discovered the affair, so he remained calm and returned home on the Dragon Boat Festival on the 21st of the lunar month, visited his wife, and then left, claiming to return to his hometown. Unexpectedly, at 7 AM yesterday morning, Xia suddenly returned and saw his wife in the room. Without asking any questions, he took out a sharp knife and stabbed her abdomen. She was caught off guard and was stabbed, causing her intestines to spill out and blood to splatter all over the floor. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, Xia quickly fled the scene. Someone reported it to the police, and she was rushed to the hospital. Her life is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Zhai Changshun, Owner of a Fish Business, Continued Hearing on a Boat Rental Dispute, Both Sides Stick to their Positions, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Han Funan, a 49-year-old Shanghai native residing at No. 44 Tongfu Lane, Min Tini Yin Road in the French Concession, owned a small steamboat before the August 13th incident, which traveled along the inland rivers. Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident and the retreat of the National Army westward, the steamboat could not operate and was moored within the blockade line at Tiansheng Port in Nantong. In March of last year, Qu Changshun, the owner of the Qu Changshun Fish Business, and his nephew, Qu Jiugao, rented the steamboat from Han to transport fish. A three-month lease was agreed upon at the time, and after the term expired,</p>
<p>The rental was terminated. Han claimed that Qu Mingqing continued to rent the boat individually after the lease expired, and Liu Wuzhai from Wuxi came forward to sign the lease renewal contract, with Qu Mingqing acting as the guarantor. However, Qu and the others, without obtaining the consent of the boat owner, added the steamboat to the Japanese-owned "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company" and renamed it "Yixing Maru" to navigate the waters. They hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Tribunal of the Second Special District Court against Qu Mingqing, Liu Wuzhai, and others to return the steamboat.</p>
<p>The initial trial resulted in a loss for the plaintiff, Han Funan. Han, dissatisfied with the verdict, again commissioned lawyer Wu Peng to appeal to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The appellees, Qu Mingqing and Liu Wuzhai, hired lawyer Tang Ying. The case was heard once and then postponed. Witnesses were summoned and investigated, and the parties were ordered to mediate outside the court. As the two parties failed to reach a settlement outside the court, the acting presiding judge of the Third Branch of the Higher Court, Tong Jishi, along with judges Wu Xiangzu and He Jingcen, convened a collegial panel yesterday afternoon at 3 PM to continue</p>
<p>The trial. Both parties were represented by their lawyers. Wu Peng, the lawyer for the appellant, stated that no settlement had been reached, and that he was dissatisfied with the original judgment and requested that it be overturned and that the appellees be ordered to jointly return the Yongfu steamboat, and explained the grounds for the appeal. Tang Ying, the lawyer for the appellees, argued that the appellant's Yongfu steamboat was parked at the Shanghai dock when it was rented out, so the appellees parked it at the old garbage bridge dock in Shanghai when the lease expired on July 17, fulfilling their obligation to return the vessel.</p>
<p>The testimony of the witness Cai Juming, who was hired by the appellant, was naturally unfavorable to the appellees, and the testimony was also contradictory. Why would the appellees park the boat and incur rent and losses themselves? Furthermore, how the Yongfu steamboat was towed away by the "Shanghai Shipping Company" had nothing to do with the appellees. The accusation that the appellees added the boat to the "Shanghai Shipping Company" was false. The appellant himself had also contacted the "Shanghai Shipping Company" several times. The boat boss, Cai Juming, also admitted that after the steamboat was towed away, his wages were also paid by the "Shanghai Shipping Company."</p>
<p>Moreover, the appellant's boat was originally berthed in Tiansheng Port after the August 13th incident, and he entrusted the "Shanghai Shipping Company" to tow it out, which was evidenced by the documents. As for the witness Wang Zhiliang, he was completely instigated by the appellant to make false accusations. The suggestion that the appellees persuaded Wang to negotiate compensation was laughable. The original judgment was fair and appropriate and should be upheld and the appeal dismissed. After reviewing the facts, the court declared the arguments closed and scheduled the sentencing for the 27th.</p>
<h3>Raping his Concubine's Daughter</h3>
<p>Wang Xiuzhen, a 37-year-old woman from Jiading, and her 14-year-old daughter, Huiying, became acquainted with Zhang Qiwen from Pudong. Zhang is currently unemployed and living with them in the Andong Inn, No. 7, East Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. Wang Xiuzhen suddenly reported to the French Police the day before yesterday that Zhang Qiwen had forcibly raped Huiying, causing her to contract syphilis and copious amounts of vaginal discharge. She requested an investigation. The police chief immediately sent a detective to arrest Zhang. Yesterday, he was brought to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Bureau, requested that the investigation be postponed. Wang Xiuzhen and her daughter testified about the rape. The defendant confessed that he had raped her. He stated that because he was unemployed, the mother and daughter worked part-time, and the income was not enough for the concubine to smoke opium. He accused the mother and daughter of having affairs outside and hating him, so they falsely accused him out of spite. After reviewing the confession, Judge Miao Qingbang ordered the case to be postponed to July 1 for further hearing. The defendant was detained, and the woman was sent to the forensic doctor for examination pending verification.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>According to the statement of the party concerned, Anbu Enterprise Company, it was recently read in the news column of today's Shen Xin newspapers that there was a news item about a lawsuit involving the company and Ye Huating for land rental. The description of the process is mostly inconsistent with the facts. The Yichang Road Seymour Road base was rented by Ye Huating to this company for the use of building houses, not rented to Yin Zhiling personally. The statement in Shen Xin newspapers that Yin Zhiling, in the name of Yin Chulan of Anbu Enterprise Company, rented one mu and two fen of land on Huji Yichang Road Seymour Road from Ye Huating last winter is obviously untrue. Furthermore, it was also found that during the court hearing the day before yesterday, Ye Huating and his lawyer applied to summon the two people, Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao, from the original China, but the court rejected them in court and ordered the arguments to be concluded and the judgment to be announced on the 24th of this month. However, Xin Shen newspapers reported that Lawyer Pan requested in court to summon Lu Liugen and Wang Chuanmao from the original China to the court to prove the negotiation process at that time. After questioning both parties, the court ordered the hearing to be postponed, which is even more inconsistent with the facts. In addition, the previous process of this case and the court hearing on that day are mostly inaccurate. It is believed that Ye Huating intends to discredit the reputation of this company by deliberately sending false information to the news agency for publication in Xin Shen newspapers. Please ask your lawyer to send separate letters to the Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao to make corrections, as requested by the parties. We have sent separate letters to each newspaper as requested, and hope that your newspaper will publish this letter in the letter column as a correction. Sincerely, Lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan, June 22nd.</p>

<h3>From the Realgar Wine of the Dragon Boat Festival to the Summer Hygiene of Marital Life</h3>
<p>Eating zongzi should indeed remind you of raising sons; raising sons should raise sons with life-giving spiritual power!</p>
<p>In Chinese social customs, in addition to eating zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival, men and women, young and old, all drink some realgar wine. Children's faces, hands, and even their entire bodies are smeared with realgar wine, like a clown with painted faces. In addition, the houses are filled with calamus and wormwood, or even burned with Cangzhu and Baizhi. Although it is said to ward off evil spirits, it is actually an old-fashioned hygiene movement. The significance is to awaken people to the fact that summer has arrived, that the five poisonous creatures are breeding, and that everything must be paid attention to for prevention. That's right, once summer arrives, the weather is hot and humid, the human body tissues are relaxed, and various viruses and bacteria breed. The spread of epidemics is something that cannot be ignored! However, in the summer, due to the hot weather, men and women wear only the lightest and thinnest clothes on their bodies. The flesh is exposed, and humans are emotional animals, so how can they not be moved? Therefore, it is said that summer is the most sensual and erotic season between men and women. In Paris, even a semi-nude goddess statue will cause people to stop and admire it. How much more so a real and lively model? Imagine after a fragrant bath, strolling with a lover in the moonlight before flowers, mutually exchanging the source of love, and murmuring sweet words. What a wonderful realm this is! However, both men and women must have considerable restraint in this realm. Then the life of love can be forever beautiful.</p>
<p>Physical deficiency and strong desire, this is an immortal saying. If a man suffers from nocturnal emission, kidney deficiency, impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc., then lust is most likely to be impulsive. However, in the real marital life, it is only a fleeting moment, and his heart is full of guilt! At the same time, the wife's enthusiasm is aroused, but she cannot be satisfied. How painful and remorseful this is! Therefore, in this fragrant and sensual summer, there must be full control over lust, and then happiness can be ensured and health can be secured. Otherwise, it is not only painful but also extremely dangerous! To cure the above-mentioned symptoms and have the ability to control desires, according to the world's famous doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Gonadin" (for both men and women) is the most effective treatment. After men take it, it can generate sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, nourish the nerves, promote development, and regulate metabolism. After women take it, it can regulate menstruation and seed, make the breasts erect, make the cheeks rosy, and enhance beauty. If taken for a long time, it can prolong life, rejuvenate, and become younger. However, men with nocturnal emission must also take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" (available at Zhengwei, Dalu, Huaying, Sino-French, Sino-Western and other major pharmacies) to stop nocturnal emission for faster results. The above-mentioned good medicines, because of their high quality and effective power, are regarded as holy medicines by Chinese and Western people and are happy to use them.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>Breasts Can Determine a Woman's Lifelong Destiny</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>There's no need to shy away from it. No matter how mature and prudent a man is, if he sees a graceful and sensual beauty, everyone will stare and feel an inexplicable affection. The reason why a beauty is so precious and worthy of admiration cannot but be attributed to the pair of breasts on her chest. Because a woman's breasts are like the spire of a glass pagoda. Without it, no matter how exquisite the pagoda is, it will always feel incomplete. A woman without towering breasts rising and swaying gracefully on her chest, even if she has the beauty of Wang Zhaojun and Zhao Feiyan, and wears the most fashionable clothes, will only be called "Sick Xishi" and will not be valued by the men of the times. This can be asserted. Therefore, young women in Europe and America today, when it comes to beauty, are unwilling to waste unnecessary powder fees, but focus on the development of the breasts. They regard the breasts as a second life. If there is a withered state, they will immediately use the German famous medicine "Gonadin" for women to compensate, because the main reason for breast atrophy is that the reproductive gland ovaries are destroyed by chest binding, self-pollution, irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, anemia, etc., which affects the metabolism. Therefore, the most fundamental way is to take the ovarian endocrine preparation "Gonadin" for women, which is the most effective. This agent has been confirmed by the president of the Royal Hospital of England, Harvard Locke Ellis, and Dr. Luxing of the American Baxter Hospital to be well-prepared and highly effective. It can be taken regularly regardless of cold or heat. If you take it in the yellow and humid season, it can not only gradually erect the atrophied breasts, but also regulate menstruation, enhance the various tissues of the body, strengthen the metabolic function, produce a large number of new cells, so that all germs dare not invade, beautify the face and strengthen the body. Its efficacy is truly indescribable.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission is the Precursor to Kidney Deficiency</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Kidney deficiency in married men is common in today's society. The symptoms are that during the spring boudoir comedy between husband and wife, there is premature ejaculation and impotence, and energy is scattered, turning a good thing into a bad thing. In addition, in daily work, there is a feeling of soreness in the waist and back, and fatigue in the limbs. As for the symptoms of mental weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, and blurred vision, they are commonly associated with kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>The body of a young man should be as lush and strong as a spring bamboo shoot. Why does he suffer from kidney deficiency and brain weakness? This is mostly due to self-pollution or nocturnal emission. Because the semen in a young man's body is his most precious source of life, it functions to regulate metabolism and strengthen development, and its effect on nerves is especially great. If self-pollution and nocturnal emission cause excessive consumption of semen, the body will inevitably suffer, and the first to suffer will be the brain and kidneys. Therefore, those who have not been treated for nocturnal emission, symptoms of brain weakness and kidney deficiency are almost inevitable. In addition, incomplete development of the whole body, local smallness like fingers, yellow face, thin muscles, premature aging, and shortened life are also often combined with kidney deficiency and brain failure. Indeed, such a man, showing incompetence everywhere, not only has no hope of success in learning, but also in the marital life of passing on the family line, often makes seeking pleasure turn into displeasure, and there is no marital love, or no children are born, leaving a lifelong regret!</p>
<p>The only cure for nocturnal emission is to purify the heart and reduce desires, abstain from self-pollution, and take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop nocturnal emission, which is the most effective treatment. If nocturnal emission has caused symptoms such as brain weakness, kidney deficiency, incomplete development, and premature aging, then the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Gonadin" must also be taken to cultivate and nourish the brain and kidneys, increase semen and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote the function of development. If continued, it will definitely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time and make the body exceptionally healthy. If the afflicted can come to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment, and at the same time use electrotherapy and injection methods, the results will be faster.</p>

<h3>The New Value of Electrotherapy in Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>In the past decade, there has been significant progress in the treatment of gonorrhea, especially in physical therapy. Considering electrotherapy within physical therapy, it initially used wavelengths, then discovered that long-wave electrotherapy could not fully exhibit its sterilizing capabilities in certain environments. Thus, further research and improvements led to the invention of short-wave electrotherapy, which proved to be more efficient in application and sterilization compared to long-wave. However, short-wave also has its shortcomings in certain situations, while long-wave retains its advantages. Therefore, both long-wave and short-wave electrotherapy should be used in conjunction for gonorrhea treatment, but they both have numerous limitations that are difficult to enumerate. Consequently, scholars have tirelessly researched and improved electrical equipment, leading to advancements. The electrotherapy commonly used by physicians today is mostly outdated and does not provide the desired sterilizing effect. Dismissing electrotherapy altogether because of this is an oversimplification by those with superficial knowledge. There is now a newly invented electrotherapy that best meets our ideal – the Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy.</p>
<p>Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy is the latest invention in the German electrotherapy field. Its penetration and sterilizing power are just right, avoiding both excess and deficiency. It can thoroughly eliminate gonococci in the lymph nodes of both acute and chronic gonorrhea patients. As a result, major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and America are equipped with Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy machines. Since the invention of Filtered Lymph Galvanic Therapy, electrotherapy in the treatment of gonorrhea has been re-evaluated. Based on my experience over the past decade, Filtered Lymph Therapy is the best among electrotherapies. If the condition is carefully assessed and supplemented with appropriate treatments, such as prostate massage for prostatitis and He氏 serum for arthritis, a complete cure can be achieved within a limited time. This is because Filtered Lymph Therapy can sterilize and filter out lymph toxins, while the serum can eliminate gonococci in the blood.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Youths in Burma Organize a Group to Return to China for Further Studies; Twenty-Five Arrive in Kunming</h3>

<h3>Overview of China's Broadcasting Education in the Past Three Years (Part 1): Modifying Programs to Meet Needs, Purchasing and Distributing Radios to Various Provinces</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Xu Langqiu, an official in charge of broadcasting education at the Ministry of Education's Department of Social Education, recently submitted a document to his superior department for reporting to the Ministry of Education for review, outlining the state of China's broadcasting education over the past three years. The original report is quite lengthy, and the following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Starting from October 10, 1935, the Ministry of Education added educational programs to the Central Broadcasting Station, hiring staff to broadcast daily. However, due to the lack of a confirmed budget, the Ministry could not afford to handle matters such as purchasing and distributing equipment and printing lecture notes. Starting in 1936, special funds were allocated from the public education construction fund, and a six-year plan was established. After approval, the plan was gradually implemented. Despite the outbreak of the war of resistance, efforts continued unabated, but transportation, equipment manufacturing, editing, printing, and inspection were all affected. The following is a summary of the implementation situation over the past three years:</p>
<p>Improving Programs</p>
<p>The original educational segments were scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with lectures aimed at the general public, focusing on various common-sense materials. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays were reserved for lectures to middle school students, focusing on basic knowledge of various subjects. The writing and broadcasting were all handled by scholars and experts in various fields hired by the Ministry of Education. Starting in 1936, to further promote public literacy education, a textbook teaching program for public schools was added. The Ministry of Education sent staff to teach the Ministry's-compiled textbooks for public schools daily. In addition to free distribution by provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus, over 800 people requested textbooks directly from the Ministry of Education, demonstrating the program's effectiveness. After the outbreak of the war of resistance, all educational broadcasts focused on resistance propaganda. The Ministry of Education hired experts with expertise in military affairs and politics to write scripts, which were broadcast by Ministry staff. When the government relocated, and the Central Broadcasting Station ceased broadcasting, the Ministry of Education was also ordered to temporarily move to Changsha, where it broadcast resistance education through the Changsha Broadcasting Station. Later, the Ministry of Education moved again to Chongqing, establishing an office in Hankou. In addition to maintaining the resistance education program at the Central Broadcasting Station in Chongqing three times a week, the Ministry of Education also added a youth self-study program at the Hankou Municipal Broadcasting Station, providing an opportunity for out-of-school youth to supplement their basic scientific knowledge. The subjects were biology, physics and chemistry, and civics. Later, the Wuhan office of the Ministry of Education was abolished, and staff moved to Sichuan. All broadcasting matters in Hankou were handled by the Ministry of Education providing materials and distributing them to local radio stations for broadcast. The educational program broadcasts at the Changsha Broadcasting Station were also handled by a Ministry staff member stationed at the station to write and broadcast scripts. At the Chongqing office, in addition to the staff assigned by the Ministry of Education to conduct resistance education broadcasts, a public wartime knowledge program was added, airing twice a week. Future improvements may be made as needed.</p>
<p>Purchasing and Manufacturing Radios</p>
<p>The radio receivers distributed by the Ministry of Education to various provinces and cities were all ordered from the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant of the National Construction Commission and the China Electrical Engineering Corporation. A total of 1,000 units were purchased in 1935 and 1,370 in 1936. However, due to the war, 200 units from the Electrical Machinery Plant and 275 units from the China Electrical Engineering Corporation were delivered in Hankou only in 1938 and distributed for use in the southwestern provinces. In 1938, the radios were issued based on cash disbursements, with each provincial education department purchasing and distributing them. The following is a statistical record of the radio receivers purchased and distributed by the Ministry of Education over the years: (1) In 1935, subsidies were provided for 1,000 radio receivers to various provinces and cities: 149 to Shandong, 129 to Fujian, 126 to Hunan, 88 to Zhejiang, 62 to Anhui, 55 to Guangxi, 8 to Shaanxi, 43 each to Hubei and Gansu, 40 to Shanxi, 38 to Jiangxi, 37 to Sichuan, 25 to Chahar, 20 to Yunnan, 19 to Beiping, 18 to Guangdong, 16 to Guizhou, 9 each to Hebei and Suiyuan, 8 to Xinjiang, 7 to Ningxia, 3 each to Shanghai, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei, and 2 to Jiangsu.

(3) In 1937, a total of 410 units were distributed: 125 to Guangdong, 108 to Guangxi, 75 to Yunnan, 50 each to Guizhou and Sichuan, 1 to Gansu, and 1 to an affiliated organization of the Ministry of Education. (4) In 1938, a total of 222 units were distributed: 29 to affiliated organizations of the Ministry of Education, 24 to Gansu, 20 to Sichuan, 15 each to Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Xikang, 10 each to Zhejiang, Henan, and Yunnan, 5 each to Ningxia, Xinjiang, Anhui, and Fujian, 4 to Central government organizations, and 3 to Chongqing Municipality, and 2 to Mongolia and Tibet. In total, subsidies were provided for 2,513 radio receivers to various provinces and cities over the four years.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Recruits Students from Occupied Areas</h3>

Any male student who has graduated from junior high school and is free from illness may apply.

<p>Sports figures here are surprised by the above decision, in which Polish representative Roacheski was elected and Chinese representative Xu Chengji was not selected. Another noteworthy point is that Miss Nicole of the UK, in women's doubles, is only sixteen years old and is participating in Wimbledon for the first time. Finally, the status of the United States in the international tennis world can be seen from the fact that the United States accounts for as many as eleven of the twenty-eight players.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on "The Patriot"</h3>
<p>— Sima Sheng</p>
<p>I read the original book of "The Patriot" a long time ago and had many feelings to express. If at that time many people were mobilizing to translate it, and there was a grand and bustling situation, it seemed inappropriate to join in with my superfluous words. Recently, after seeing several translated versions on the market and reading Mr. Lin Ying's article "Having Read 'The Patriot'" in Free Talk, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions, and I had to express myself.</p>
<p>My feelings about "The Patriot" are generally the same as Mr. Lin Ying's; the only difference is that I was not as "moved to anger" as he was. Speaking frankly, Pearl Buck's novels are nothing special, especially her descriptions of Chinese people and affairs, which are simply ridiculously superficial. Although her descriptions of Chinese peasant life in "The Good Earth" could "sell savage heads to the West," when our own people read it, we can see many flaws. However, because she is a Westerner, this understanding seems to be enough to make readers admire her (I wonder how many works in the Chinese literary scene are even more superficial than hers!). The reason why she was able to "cause a sensation in the American publishing industry," "make a fortune," and even receive the Nobel Prize was probably for this reason. It is certain that a writer with such insufficient understanding would not be able to write well about such a great scene, such a turbulent era, and such complicated subject matter. Therefore, the failure of "The Patriot" was expected and "not worth mentioning" in the first place. However, it is a bit unexpected that such an unremarkable work has not only "caused a sensation in the American publishing industry" again, but has also "mobilized a large number of cultural figures to translate and promote" it. This is largely why Mr. Lin Ying was "moved to anger."</p>
<p>I think the shortcomings of "The Patriot" lie in its avoidance of difficulties, its avoidance of importance, and its simplification of complexity. Since the scene of this story includes the major changes in China over the past decade, the emphasis should be on depicting the Chinese people reflected in these changes. Since it extends to the War of Resistance Against Japan and even after the evacuation of Hankou, it should have described the Chinese people's world-shaking heroic resistance attitude. However, due to insufficient experience, the author has slipped over these important factors. Therefore, when we examine the original book, we find that almost more than half of it is devoted to describing a love story; and even in that small half, there is no effort to depict or render it, but rather an attempt to avoid all actual scenes. This is the biggest shortcoming I have found.</p>
<p>In addition, the author writes the characters in the book very vaguely; this vagueness is also due to her insufficient understanding and experience. Wu Yifan and Liu Enlai should be two progressive archetypes, but she has written them into two legendary figures, with little to recommend them. However, I think it is a bit excessive for Mr. Lin Ying to think that there are insults to China. Although the excerpts he selected "declared" that they were "not out of context," I think they misunderstood the original meaning. "The author's portrayal of the Tongzhou Incident" is a description of the shameless propaganda in Japanese newspapers. "The author...selected this unfortunate event and satirized it," as well as satirizing the Chinese Air Force and Army, is a description of Yi Ke's traitorous intentions and traitorous theories. This seems necessary in a novel, because not every character in a novel can be a hero, and not every character is a good person. There are always bad people and opposing opinions.</p>
<p>I am not favoring the original author, but I think Pearl Buck may be quite sympathetic to China, but because she lacks understanding and experience, her descriptions are very vague and somewhat counterproductive. If you don't believe me, I can also excerpt a passage below:</p>
<p>"I saw, I saw with my own eyes—he told them to bring a woman into his tent. She was crying and struggling, but he walked towards her without hesitation—I was mad. I went to the street—I—I saw the first woman—a child—who must have been twelve years old—although maybe she was only ten years old, maybe fifteen years old—maybe she was saying her age was younger (suspected translation error)—I dragged her into the alley too..."</p>
<p>To do what? I don't think I need to excerpt any further. What is written here is the inhumane atrocities of a certain country! And such depictions are "readily available" throughout "the whole book."</p>
<h3>To the Nameless Heroes</h3>
<p>— Time Light</p>
<p>Friends: I am the person who fears loneliness and calmness the most. To me, loneliness and calmness are like a night of utter darkness, with no lights, no stars, no moon, being in an abyss of ten thousand feet, having to climb through tens of thousands of tunnels, which frightens me so much.</p>
<p>Before the war, I had many friends who understood and sympathized with each other. They often gathered together, and most of what they talked about was the current world situation and the international situation. Generally, friends were also generous, forthright, enthusiastic, hardworking, and responsible, even more so than ordinary men. But shortly after the war, two disappeared, and have been missing for nearly two years; one sacrificed herself, and she sacrificed herself exactly today last year!</p>
<p>Only I am still living alone on this devil island, living the life of a weak woman, and everything has become my memory. But I am not depressed; you, martyrs, have died gloriously, but you have achieved your own aspirations, and your great spirit will exist forever.</p>
<p>Ah, friend, now another message comes, and I almost don't believe my ears, you have sacrificed yourself for the country! Really, you died, I laugh, I laugh at your getting benevolence by seeking it. An overseas Chinese who grew up overseas, would sacrifice himself and come to the embrace of the motherland, which is full of flames of war. He went from America to China, his blood staining the battlefield, how great that is!</p>
<p>You are a young man full of vigor. In the team, you worked even harder to shoulder your responsibilities. In less than two months after joining the army, you took on four positions by yourself. You took the lead in charging on the front lines, you taught the brothers in the army, you taught the people to sing popular songs, and you ran the wall newspaper.</p>
<p>I still remember: "The environment is like this, but I have to transform the environment and fight against the environment!" you said.</p>
<p>"Friend, I hope you go forward bravely. That's right, the environment is for us to create!" I always advised you like this when I heard you talk about some special circumstances in that place. We were so impressed with each other when we first met, and that's how we got to know each other, but there weren't many opportunities for us to have long talks all day long, because everyone was busy. You were resolute and mature, extremely alert, and your eyes would often turn dark black when you encountered a difficult thing. You sympathized with all the oppressed people in the world, and even went to work as a dockworker yourself, and also worked as a handyman in a factory. There are very few children like you who are born into bourgeois families!</p>
<p>From now on, may you rest peacefully in the warm soil of the motherland. Your phosphorescent bones and bright red flesh and blood are all making fertilizer for the growing new China. In the near future, more beautiful buds will grow on this land.</p>
<p>Ah! Great and glorious dead, nameless heroes who will always live in our hearts, when will I be able to bring a bouquet of flowers, lift the grass in front of your tomb, and solemnly offer it to you?</p>
<h3>Voices from the Inland</h3>
<p>— Lun Ting</p>
<p>Come on, friends! If you don't plan to come, you must come; if you plan to come but still want to come later, come sooner!</p>
<p>I know you are dissatisfied on the isolated island. Some of you are studying, but you are not settled, because Shanghai is not a place to study at all, especially now. Some of you are doing small things, barely able to make a living, but you feel bored, thinking that working like this is too meaningless. Some of you are venturing out, or are even more oppressed by life, and are bored beyond compare. You all want to live more satisfied and happier lives.</p>
<p>Then, strangely, why don't you come to the inland? The inland has freedom, you can do whatever you want. The inland has vigor, which can make a decadent person rise up. The inland is full of meaningful work, those who are strong can carry guns, those who are eloquent can propagandize, and those who have specialized skills can be used appropriately. The inland not only has no worries about life, but is also richer in the reality of life. Why don't you come?</p>
<p>You must come, and come sooner! You know, our pain is gradually passing; our light is just ahead; all our great goals are about to be achieved. Are you unwilling to welcome such an era? Are you unwilling to participate in the realization of this era? If you rely on the isolated island, if you are not intending to wait to be slaves of a fallen country, are you intending to stand by now and enjoy the fruits of your labor in the future? Don't you have ambition? Don't you have ambition?</p>
<p>Of course, you also have various difficulties that prevent you from getting away. But have you forgotten the timeless motto "Where there is a will, there is a way"? As long as you have the will, I believe your family's burdens can be resolved; as long as you are willing to ask others, you will definitely be able to find a suitable path.</p>
<p>Please temporarily close your physical ears and eyes, and listen with the ears of your heart, we are calling you, please come and participate in the joyous banquet that will be held soon; look with the eyes of your heart, we are waving to you, please join us in repelling the invaders, and then together build our new China!</p>
<p>Come on, friends on the isolated island!</p>
<h3>(7) The Experience of Victory</h3>
<p>Victory is welcomed by people, and failure is hated by people; however, how many people can live a victorious life? The Christian Paul said: "I discipline my body and make it my slave." Paul knew that the greatest enemy of man is himself. A man can conquer cities and lands, but he may not be able to conquer himself. I can frankly tell the reader that it is yourself, you know that you can still whitewash on the outside, but on the inside you are absolutely cursed! Man's ego has no goodness! Trapped in the pit of sin, unable to extricate himself! Throughout his life, from childhood to the present, the sins he has committed are countless! Even Paul once repented and said: "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?" But according to the Apostle Paul, his experience of victory was this: "Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! I can be rescued, I can be victorious." It can be seen that the secret of Paul's victorious life is not relying on his own works, but relying on his submission to the Lord Jesus. Throughout the ages, countless Christian saints have confirmed in their life experiences that Paul's words are absolutely true. —Shanghai Christian Literature Society, P.O. Box 1227</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union: "I'll have to leave you for a while."</h3>
<h3>Impressions of a Journey (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>"But the more people with lazy cultural psychology, the more pitiful they are, the more they will be regarded as 'elegant and leisurely', and the more they can live comfortably. If this psychology becomes the current trend, it will be terrible, and literature will definitely become something like licorice and mint, which can clear the mind and cool the lungs when eaten, but cannot cure any real diseases. Literature should be more effective than licorice and mint, at least it should be able to cure the common cold.</p>
<p>'If one function is lazy, the second function will also become lazy. Because to fob off the viewing public with lazy thoughts and art, the second writer thinks that this must be an easier path to take, thinking that four or five packs of Beautiful brand cigarettes bought for a dime must not have come from a little bit of luck. So everyone rushed to make cheap goods, I think this is very sad, because people are forcing us to walk this path of decline!...'</p>
<p>'...You may as well try to do some great works, leaving aside those undue hopes.'</p>
<p>I cut off this paragraph of thinking and inserted it here. I think this technique has already added a lot to the small value of this article, and it is enough for you to get some good impressions from the lightly sketched paragraphs. I myself, in the name of the author, appeal, how can I guide others, but I have said so.</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>Early morning, early morning, the little monk came to knock on the door, saying that breakfast was prepared, so that we could go and see the sun rise out of the mountains. I got up and distinguished the road in front of me from the darkness, while waking up the two Pengs, and came to the lit living room.</p>
<h3>Flying</h3>
<p>— Jinxi</p>
<p>Not content with mediocrity,</p>
<p>I have the ambition to fly,</p>
<p>On the boundless wilderness,</p>
<p>In front of countless masses,</p>
<p>Bravely giving speeches non-stop,</p>
<p>Making the masses moved,</p>
<p>Their faces excited as if mad.</p>
<p>So, regardless of day and night,</p>
<p>When I speak,</p>
<p>Like the sound of sea waves,</p>
<p>It will inevitably fluctuate;</p>
<p>Swords clashing,</p>
<p>Clanging non-stop,</p>
<p>Truth is victorious,</p>
<p>The groaning robbers are destroyed.</p>
<p>I further declare to the masses;</p>
<p>We are reborn,</p>
<p>In a beautiful society;</p>
<p>Let us raise the torch for the victory of light;</p>
<p>Our swords are held high above our heads.</p>
<p>We are not content with mediocrity,</p>
<p>We want to fly!</p>
<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Since "Having Read 'The Patriot'" was published, many readers have expressed their opinions. Now we have published Mr. Sima Sheng's article, and we have to cut off the others. Because we feel that with these two articles on this book, that's enough. If there are no outstanding insights, we don't plan to talk about it anymore, so as not to waste space.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Sima Sheng thinks that the negative articles in the book are not insults to China, which I cannot agree with, because we love China, so we are not willing to say these things publicly. Pearl Buck claims to love China too, so why is she willing to say it publicly? Moreover, these words are not facts, but some gimmicks she made up to deceive Westerners. It's not too much to say that she insulted China.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Do Not Use Drafts</h3>
<p>— Bingzhong</p>
<p>There are two reasons why foreign merchants do not use drafts: first, drafts cannot directly purchase foreign exchange; to buy foreign exchange, they must go through a discounting procedure, which costs several tenths of a percent in discounting fees, so foreign merchants refuse to use them because they are afraid of trouble and want to save money.</p>
<p>However, this should not be the case, because turning the deposits of various banks into drafts is an order from the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and foreigners stationed in China should circulate them as usual and should not discriminate against them. However, it is said that foreigners are justified in not using drafts because of a judicial ruling.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the change to drafts, Chinese people paid foreign merchants with drafts, such as rent, etc., but the foreign merchants refused, and then there was litigation. As a result, the Chinese lost the lawsuit. It is said that drafts were limited to use between the same industries. This was the situation before the August 13th incident, which was indeed the case; but the actual nature of drafts after the August 13th incident was somewhat different. The foreign merchants got this verdict and felt even more confident, and resolutely refused to use drafts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the circulation of drafts has been greatly affected.</p>
<p>However, according to the recent reply from the Ministry of Finance to the Knitwear Industry Association regarding the interpretation of the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign currency, the matter can be understood. That is, "If there is any dispute in the legal provisions, it shall be interpreted by the judicial authorities." But "If there are doubts about the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign currency, they should all follow the Ministry's instructions and be uniformly implemented, and all levels of courts should also apply uniformly," then the circulation of drafts will naturally not be restricted by any party, and foreign merchants have no reason to refuse to use them.</p>
<h3>Financial News: Cash Restricted, Gold Unable to be Traded, Informal Off-Exchange Prices First Down, Then Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market situation for spot gold was caused by the news that the Hong Kong Chinese banks suddenly closed for three days during the Dragon Boat Festival, and that the Shanghai Bankers Association suddenly received an order from the Chongqing National Government that withdrawals were limited to 500 yuan in cash per week, and that amounts above 500 yuan would be paid by draft. This measure was to prevent speculation and manipulation and to prevent capital flight. With the recent tightening of money, the further restriction of cash withdrawals has made the cash market feel even more scarce. Therefore, buyers were immediately at a loss, and the sellers had no way to sell, so the market was at a standstill. As a result, there were no transactions all day long, and off-exchange, it was heard in the morning that some weak bulls were forced to close their positions due to pressure from the collateral lenders. The price was reduced by 249 yuan compared to the pre-holiday price, to 2,420 yuan, but the amount was only dozens of taels. This was purchased by a certain retail outlet. In the morning, it was also heard that Xianghe Gold Shop purchased 10 taels from customers and transferred 10 taels to customers. The prices were both 2,500 yuan. In the afternoon, after the foreign exchange market rose sharply during the day, it suddenly tightened, causing the black market gold price to rebound upwards. The final buying price was around 2,600 yuan, a drop of 70 yuan compared to the pre-holiday price.</p>
<p>Confused Inflow and Outflow of Ornaments</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at the large gold shops still opened at 270 yuan, but the buying price was affected by the restrictions on cash withdrawals, and although there was no official market price, the black market price fell sharply. Therefore, the buying price had to be reduced by 15 yuan compared to the selling price. At noon, the buying price had to be reduced by 20 yuan due to the continued weakness of spot gold. At about 2 PM, because the off-exchange buying price of spot gold had risen back to near the 2,600 yuan mark, the buying price went up by 10 yuan. By the evening, the selling price at the large gold shops was still 270 yuan, the new gold shops were 268 yuan, and the buying prices were all reduced by about 10 yuan, usually reduced by 7-8 yuan.</p>
<p>British Standard Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 21st, the price of British standard gold per ounce remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5.5 pence, so the Central Bank's Chinese cash purchase price also remained fixed at 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold price remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Impact: British Gold Once Loosened to Seven "Ban" (a unit of currency) / American Dollars Also Reached 13.625 Yuan Early / Japanese Banks Absorbed in the Afternoon, Then Gradually Tightened Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the HSBC exchange rate, remained unchanged. However, the unofficial market conditions were unpredictable, with extreme confusion in the middle. Generally, it first loosened sharply and then tightened drastically. This was because, in the early morning, news of the Hong Kong China Merchants Bank's three-day closure spread. In response, the Ministry of Finance, to prevent capital outflow, re-implemented restrictions on cash withdrawals by Shanghai's banking and money industries. Starting from the 22nd, all deposits were limited to withdrawals of 500 yuan per week. The already depleted cash became even scarcer, and remittance and discount rates soared to unprecedented levels, reaching over 15%. This caused widespread panic among operators. Hua Merchants Bank and Sino-Western speculators with foreign exchange positions rushed to sell them off. Several smaller banks, which had previously hoarded foreign exchange, faced urgent demands from banks and had no cash, so they had to liquidate and sell. Furthermore, Sassoon, a Western firm, showed an increasingly strong desire to sell British gold. Foreign banks also had weak appetites for buying. With import firms temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude and exporters slightly selling, the foreign exchange market, which had been tight since the outbreak on the 7th of this month, finally loosened dramatically yesterday. At noon, British gold reached a low of seven "ban," and the American dollar reached a low of 13.625 yuan. Supply even exceeded demand several times over. In the afternoon, a certain Japanese bank took advantage of the low prices to absorb large quantities, and import firms also showed buying interest. The supply from sellers also weakened, causing the market to tighten again sharply. British gold once tightened back to six and a half "ban," and the American dollar also softened to 12.615 yuan. Eventually, the market ended with a slightly firmer tone as sellers offered supply again. Spot transactions were quite active, mainly for settling positions, while futures transactions were rare. The Hong Kong dollar also followed the trend of first loosening and then tightening, ultimately depreciating by 0.25.</p>
<p>Many rushed to settle positions.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the recent London silver price continued to drop by 0.125, with the forward price remaining flat. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw gold price also did not change. The exchange rate between the British pound and the American dollar narrowed by 0.013. The exchange rate with Shanghai remained flat, and the rate with France was slightly higher by 0.003. The American dollar fell against the British pound by 0.0125, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and fell against France by 0.000625. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning at 6.5 "ban" for British gold and 12.65625 yuan for the American dollar. Compared to the day before the holiday (i.e., Tuesday of this week), the British and American dollars had no change. After the market opened, news of the Ministry of Finance re-implementing restrictions on cash withdrawals by Shanghai's banking and money industries spread. With the current cash shortage, those with foreign exchange positions rushed to sell to exchange for legal tender. Foreign firms temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and foreign banks showed weak appetites for buying, causing the market to suddenly loosen. Sassoon, a Western firm, sold spot British gold to Mais Cargal and Wah Beet Lee and others, pushing the price sharply down to 6.625 "ban". Subsequently, a Hua Merchant Bank sold spot American dollars to Chase Bank, softening the price to 12.875 yuan. When the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged and the silver balance tax was announced to be abolished, (the base price for imposing the tax on the recent silver price was 19.1875 "ban"), Sassoon, a Western firm, began to sell off again. Export trading firms also slightly sold, and Hua Merchant Bank and Sino-Western speculators also competed to sell, causing the situation to become quite chaotic. The loosening trend became more severe. Sassoon, a Western firm, sold spot British gold to Wah Beet Lee and Mais Cargal and others, pushing the price from 6.6875 "ban" to 7 "ban". Later, a Hua Merchant Bank and Sino-Western speculators also sold spot American dollars to Chase Bank and others, pushing the price from 12.90625 yuan to 13.625 yuan. By noon, the selling price of the Hong Kong dollar had also risen to over 46 yuan. At the afternoon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 7 "ban" for British gold and 13.625 yuan for the American dollar.</p>
<p>The extent of the subsequent increase is limited.</p>
<p>Later, a certain Japanese bank took advantage of the low prices to continuously absorb large quantities, and foreign firms also competed to slightly buy back to settle positions. The supply from sellers gradually decreased, causing the underlying trend to suddenly tighten. The Japanese bank bought spot British gold from foreign banks, pushing the price from 6.9375 "ban" to 6.5 "ban". It also bought spot American dollars, pushing the price from 13.5 yuan to 12.625 yuan. Later, Andar sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a foreign firm, tightening the price back to 44 yuan. When the Japanese bank stopped absorbing, the market trend slightly loosened again. At the late closing, banks' spot selling prices were 6.53125 "ban" for British gold and 12.75 yuan for the American dollar. Compared to the day before the holiday (i.e., Tuesday of this week), British gold was 0.03125 "ban" looser, and the American dollar was 0.09375 yuan firmer. (However, the fluctuations of the British and American dollars throughout the day were quite large, with a difference of 0.375 "ban" for British gold and 1 yuan for the American dollar). The Hong Kong dollar, based on the last transaction price, also increased by 0.25.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Exchange Rate Also Fell Back</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd - This morning, the exchange market opened with calm sentiment. Only the forward rate for the British pound increased by 0.03125. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate also rose by 1 yuan for the one-term rate. The rest remained unchanged. At 10:05, the forward rate for the British pound softened, returning to the closing price from yesterday, at 1 shilling and 2.75 pence. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate, influenced by the Ministry of Finance's new restrictions on cash withdrawals, fell back by 1 yuan, also to the closing price from yesterday, at 227 yuan. At 10:15, the Shanghai dollar exchange rate continued to shrink by 2 yuan, to 225 yuan. At 10:30, it further shrank by 2 yuan, to 203 yuan. At 11:30, it drastically shrank by 5 yuan, to 218 yuan. The market opened at 2:30 PM, with a firmer tone. Both the spot and forward rates for the British pound increased by 0.03125, with the spot rate at 1 shilling and 2.8125 pence and the forward rate at 1 shilling and 2.78125 pence. The American dollar also increased by 0.0625, with the spot rate at 28.875 yuan and the forward rate at 28.8125 yuan. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate rebounded by 4 yuan, to 222 yuan. The Japanese yen also increased by 0.25, to 105.75 yuan. At the close of the afternoon market, the exchange rates for the British pound, American dollar, and Japanese yen all shrank back to the opening prices from the morning. The Shanghai dollar exchange rate also continued to rise by 2 yuan, to 225 yuan.</p>
<h3>Due to Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals, Discount Rates Were Nominal</h3>
<p>The highest rate once called out was 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rates for remittance drafts and bills soared to an unprecedented and alarming level, becoming a nominal market. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan once called out as high as 200 yuan in the morning. Generally, it was 160 yuan, which was 80-90 yuan higher than the day before the holiday (Tuesday). This was mainly because, after the banking and money industries followed the Ministry's order to restrict cash withdrawals for deposits, legal tender in the market became extremely scarce, and those in need became even more desperate. The interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 2.5%, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies decreased by 0.0125. Due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram ordering the banking and money industries to restrict deposit withdrawals to prevent capital flight, there was a sudden decrease in the number of people buying foreign exchange in the local market. In the early morning, Western merchants provided a smooth supply, and the market conditions were very firm. The British currency weakened to 7 "ban," and the American currency to 13.625 yuan. Market conditions tightened in the afternoon. As a result, the British currency was 6.53125 "ban," and the American currency was 12.75 yuan. In the black market, due to the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on deposit withdrawals, the problem of legal tender was difficult to solve, and transactions could not be opened. The speculative atmosphere in the market was very strong. Although transactions were settled on the spot, those with strong financial resources had made considerable profits during the war, and those who acted as accomplices transported money abroad. The economic loss to the country was profound and significant. Now that deposit withdrawals are restricted, even a skilled housewife cannot cook without rice. The unofficial market once called out 2,420 yuan, then 2,630-40 yuan. These were not formal transactions and were difficult to complete. If the black market changes to the exchange rate market price, transactions will become scarce. Due to the chaotic exchange market and the impact of the black market closure, foreign currency market conditions first fell and then rebounded, and transactions were quite scarce. Customer demand for British and American gold sovereigns was sluggish, and there were few inquiries about British and American gold notes. Market prices fell, capital flight gradually subsided, and the financial situation improved. The price of Japanese gold notes was first weak and then firm, ultimately being the same as the market price of legal tender. Korean notes were 8.6%, and public association transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market prices for British and American gold sovereigns all decreased by 1 yuan, British gold notes decreased by 0.7 yuan, American gold notes decreased by 0.06 yuan, Hong Kong notes decreased by 0.05 yuan, Singapore notes decreased by 0.04 yuan, Dutch notes decreased by 0.05 yuan, Annam notes decreased by 0.04 yuan, Canadian notes decreased by 0.2 yuan, and Philippine notes decreased by 0.05 yuan. Only Australian gold notes increased by 0.3 yuan. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Near-Term Silver Price in the London Market Fell, While the Forward Price Remained Flat / The Silver Market in India Was Weak and Exhausted</h3>
<p>London, 21st - Silver market speculators and Eastern sellers traded, and Citibank merchants bought. The market was still flat. After the market closed, the market conditions continued to be flat. American merchants slightly bought at the listed price. The near-term silver price in the London market continued to fall by 0.125, while the forward price did not change. In New York, the American spot price remained unchanged. Also, the silver market in Mumbai, India, continued to be weak. Both spot and futures prices fell by 7 annas. There were a total of 30 transaction orders.</p>

<h3>New Financial Stabilization Measures</h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the Ministry of Finance, to stabilize the financial situation, implemented temporary financial stabilization measures and supplementary measures. After 22 months of operation, there have been no major obstacles. Recently, after the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates, the Ministry of Finance implemented a new financial stabilization measure on June 22nd. The content is very simple: starting from the 22nd, payments for deposits within 500 yuan will be made in legal tender, and payments for amounts over 500 yuan will be made by remittance. Deposits before the August 13th Incident will continue to be handled according to the financial stabilization measures. Funds remitted into the mainland are not subject to these measures, and these measures are limited to implementation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>During the war, the financial situation in Shanghai initially remained relatively stable due to the implementation of financial stabilization measures, although the situation was tense. However, the financial stabilization measures gradually lost their effectiveness over time. At the same time, the emergence of the remittance discount system further weakened the effectiveness of the financial stabilization measures in blocking capital. This year, the phenomenon of financial instability in Shanghai has gradually become apparent. I have discussed these two points: First, the results of abundant capital in Shanghai's financial situation cannot be ignored. Due to the abundance of capital in Shanghai, the current deposits of the financial industry have increased significantly. However, Shanghai lacks legitimate avenues for utilization, and the internal transfer of capital to develop the southwest has not been fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, a large portion of the capital is diverted to speculative activities, resulting in soaring prices in the concession and the abnormal development of industry. This phenomenon is not only detrimental to the stability of the financial market in Shanghai but also runs counter to the government's wartime financial policies. Second, there is pressure on foreign exchange. Shanghai's foreign trade deficit for the first five months of this year totaled approximately 100 million yuan, and the monthly trade situation shows an increase in imports and a decrease in exports. The accumulated trade deficit is increasing, and the amount of foreign exchange required is also increasing. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet regimes' efforts to acquire foreign exchange are also a constant threat. Therefore, the financial stabilization measures are now almost meaningless.</p>
<p>Since the Exchange Rate Stabilization Fund Committee adjusted exchange rates on June 7th, the foreign exchange market has been in an obvious state of instability. Although the spot market prices are equal to the HSBC exchange rates, the futures market is extremely depressed. The spread between spot and forward rates is very large, and arbitrage is as high as 5%, causing speculators to flock to arbitrage. Under this situation, Shanghai's financial situation is quite tense. Interbank lending rates, remittance discounts, and discount rates are rising daily. If there is no way to limit the development of this phenomenon, there will still be a very harmful pressure on the adjusted exchange rates. Therefore, to ensure the stability of the exchange market, it is necessary to restrain the use of legal tender - which is the biggest reason for the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures.</p>
<p>The most obvious benefit of the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures is to reduce the need for speculation in foreign exchange and to balance the current speculative commodity prices. The most obvious disadvantage is the temporary difficulty in commercial turnover. At the same time, because the measures are too simple, there are many contradictions in their implementation. For example, if a check for more than 500 yuan is deposited into a bank, some banks accept it, while others do not. If it is said to be a remittance, the former is of course correct, while the latter will inevitably be misunderstood. Because payments could originally be made with checks, the new measures of the Ministry of Finance only state that withdrawals can only be made in increments of 500 yuan per week. It does not say that checks have become remittances. In short, it is best for the Shanghai banking and money industries to formulate a detailed supplementary measure that can flexibly facilitate commercial transactions under the principle of blocking capital.</p>
<p>Finally, after the implementation of the new financial stabilization measures, the remittance discount system should be abolished, otherwise, amounts exceeding 500 yuan will be remitted, and funds cannot be blocked.</p>
<p>(June 12th, noon)</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Sentiment Remains Unstable / Domestic Bonds Fall Again by a Strong 2 Yuan / New Measures for Bank Deposits Revised / Since You Are Issuing Bonds, the Bond Market is Temporarily Suspended for Two Days / Only Two or Three Types of Foreign Stocks Were Traded</h3>
<p>Due to the Ministry of Finance not formally announcing information on the principal and interest of public bonds this time, unstable and unsubstantial retail investors still tend to sell due to panic. The market price fluctuates greatly, with a high and low difference of as much as six yuan. Furthermore, the financial sector has revised new measures for deposits according to the Ministry of Finance's order, so various parties cannot utilize banks, which is also a reason for causing public sentiment to become unstable. According to financial sector news, the future is not pessimistic. Yesterday, due to the hot weather, only one market was held in the morning, and transactions were relatively reduced. Most of those with a little strength are watching. Some are reluctantly cutting their losses due to bank loans. Therefore, the Class C bonds rose by one or two yuan when the market opened, with an opening price of 50 yuan. Within five minutes, as selling pressure gradually increased, the market price plummeted. The calling price fluctuated by around one yuan, indicating that buying customers were still controlling the market. Those who were unable to turn over capital had no choice but to sell. It was found that Le Mao Xing Yuan, Tong Kang, and Kang were the most active buyers, while Lian He first sold and then bought, which was the most effective. Tong Shun, Yong Feng, Da Feng, and No. 50 were the most active sellers, and many retail investors also sold off. The market price, which had a little vitality, was hit again. As a result, the market continued to fall by 0.9 to 2.6 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 1 million yuan. Exchange personnel, due to the initial implementation of revised bank measures, decided to temporarily suspend the market for two days starting today due to potential disputes in the collection and settlement aspects.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were transacted at a price of 6.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, Shanghai Public Industry Company reported that before the market opened, China Merchants Bank received an order from the Chongqing National Government restricting the withdrawal of current deposits, limiting each household to a maximum withdrawal of 500 yuan per week, resulting in only two or three types of stocks being traded in the market, while the rest had no prices. Only Jardine Matheson stock was active, opening at 19 yuan and quickly falling to 17.8 yuan. But since this price, the market sentiment improved, slowly rising, and the price at closing was 18.7 yuan. Transactions for other stocks were sparse throughout the day, and prices also plummeted drastically, probably due to forced liquidations of speculative positions. The exchange's transactions are mostly invested by Chinese investors. If there is no way to release the restrictions on withdrawals, the exchange's transactions will be restricted, and the market cannot be expanded. If the government's goal is to stop the outflow of capital, it can still adopt other methods instead of hindering people from transferring their capital abroad and only investing in stocks and bonds of companies with legitimate operations in this city.</p>
<p>The stock prices of various Far East companies of London British merchants on the 21st of this month (Wednesday) were stable, and the stock prices of various stocks remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds in London on the 21st of this month (Wednesday) showed a slight reduction in the decline. British and German continued to borrow money, and British treasury bills continued to fall by 1 pound, with a price of 53 pounds. Sino-French American dollar 5% public bonds fell by another 2 pounds, with a price of 52 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: US Agricultural Relief Fund Has Been Passed / Transactions in Both Chinese and Foreign Cotton Have Been Halted</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: In the New York morning cotton market, there was a wait-and-see attitude due to the lack of development in Washington. The incoming news from Liverpool and Mumbai was unfavorable, and prices slightly fell by one or two "pound-sounds". In the afternoon, news came from Washington that the US agricultural relief bill, which was of concern to the world, had made significant progress in discussions. The 225 million yuan relief fund had been passed, and there was still a 11.3 million yuan relief fund specifically for selling excess cotton that needed to undergo further debate before it could be implemented. If the Senate does not make any further changes, according to the observations of various peers, this agricultural bill may receive 36 million yuan for cotton export subsidies. As a result, cotton prices immediately rose. Near-term prices remained unchanged, and long-term prices rose by 14 "pound-sounds". Indian prices, including predictions, fell by 2 rupees, and Egyptian prices fell by more than 10 "pound-sounds".</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: Due to the government's order to the financial sector to restrict withdrawals and prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market, and the detailed measures have not yet been received, the situation in various places is extremely chaotic. Yesterday, there were absolutely no transactions.</p>
<p>Spot cotton business: No transactions were completed for either Chinese or foreign goods. Factories also took no action, probably because the issue of payment for goods was difficult to resolve, resulting in a standstill. However, in addition to the sharp drop of 2-3 rupees in the Indian cotton block corner, the exchange rate has also increased, and the calculated prices have become cheaper. However, in this chaotic state, it is impossible to grasp anything.</p>
<h3>Speculation Is Difficult to Continue / Cash Stagnation</h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange market tightened, the spot yarn market has been experiencing rapid advances and retreats in prices every day, with frequent buying and selling. Due to the very strong new buying trend in the market, new peaks have emerged one after another. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn once reached 510 yuan twice. Yesterday, the banking and money industries followed the Ministry of Finance's order to restrict payments and withdrawals and not exceed the allowed range. As a result, speculators found it difficult to operate, and the market was never able to open, falling into a standstill. In the afternoon, the market was closed and will be reopened after the banking and money industries announce a proper solution, it is said. Also, yesterday, 356 pieces of cotton yarn imported from Tianjin arrived.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Financial Impact / Cotton Cloth Transactions Severely Affected / Sudden Interruption of Goods from Shantou</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth market conditions: Yesterday, due to the Ministry of Finance's order, Shanghai banks and firms stopped overdrafts and were prohibited from remitting and discounting. Cash deposits could only be withdrawn up to 500 yuan per week. After the news spread, all transactions that used full cash, 30% cash, or 70% remittance as the shipping method came to a standstill due to the lack of cash. The shipping method by remittance was used only by a portion of Chinese factory bleached and dyed cloth and transactions between customers and peers. British and Japanese manufacturers' payments were fully cash, and Chinese factories' unbleached cotton cloth required full cash or a combination of cash and remittance. Some bleached and dyed cloth was also used with cash. As a result, new transactions were mostly halted, and scheduled deliveries could not be fulfilled as usual. Customer transactions for Chinese bleached and dyed cloth were suddenly interrupted due to the Japanese army landing in Shantou and the large-scale transactions in that area coming to an end. Retail business in this city fell sharply by half. Both local and foreign remittances and payments for various orders were still delivered as usual, but only to the extent of existing inventory. New goods, as it was impossible to obtain raw cloth and raw yarn, also had to be delayed. Deliveries of British and Japanese factory orders were not made without payment, and it was also reported that Japanese factories had not cashed some of the cash payments received before the Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday afternoon, all warehouse orders were stopped from payment. British manufacturers, however, returned the above-mentioned uncashed payments to customers and recovered the warehouse orders, but this depended on the customer and was not consistent. It was reported that Japanese factories held a meeting in the afternoon and discussed changing to selling by remittance. Yesterday, 450 pieces of piece goods arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Food: Cash Is Extremely Tight / Flour Prices Soften Unofficially</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour factories continued to open at a cash price of 4.65 yuan, but the number of transactions was already small. This was because of the lack of cash in the market in recent days. Yesterday, the bank suddenly restricted cash withdrawals, and remittance and discount rates soared to 150-160 yuan. The people in the market were uneasy, regretting that they had no money to do business, and the business was about to fall into a state of invisible stagnation. Therefore, yesterday's flour sales, except for small retail transactions on the street, customer sales also tended to be cautious. All of this was affected by financial problems. It was said that the foreign flour market had also softened unofficially. It was said that Double Eagle and other brands had opened at a remittance price of 5.05 yuan, and only 2-3,000 bags were transacted. According to the discount rate calculation, they had unofficially fallen by a lot.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, new wheat sources continued to arrive from Jing, Zhen, Su, Kun, and other places. Factory customers' purchases were still weak. Street brokers also eased up due to the extreme tightness of cash. It was also said that foreign ports continued to come to Shanghai, and another 8,000 tons of Australian wheat arrived in Shanghai. The market outlook was quite severely impacted, resulting in buyers and sellers holding each other back, resulting in lack of transactions. It was said that trading in public bonds was temporarily suspended from today, and it was feared that food transactions would also have to wait for the financial problems to be resolved before returning to normal market conditions.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grain Transactions Severely Affected</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting cash payments was announced in the financial sector, causing the food market to be the first to be affected. Although the rice market continued to be closed for the Dragon Boat Festival, there would definitely be changes in today's market. The miscellaneous grains market had resumed news broadcasts as usual, but public sentiment was unusually panicked. The hindrance to buying and selling, combined with yesterday's rush to grab hats from the speculators, continued to be confused under double pressure. Market prices were chaotic, and the number of transactions was only a few dozen bags per batch. Yesterday's informal miscellaneous grain market quotations were as follows: Dalian soybeans were priced at 9.775 yuan, Hankou suddenly soybeans were priced at 8.85 yuan, Chongming inner green beans were priced at 11.5 yuan, Chongming Mao Qing beans were priced at 12.5 yuan, Jiading white skin broad beans were priced at 7 yuan, Wujiang Qingpi broad beans were priced at 6.55 yuan, and Maojiashi Beigang Qingpi broad beans were priced at 7.67 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Legal Tender Premium Too High / Sugar Market Chaotic</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's sugar market report from London, prices rose again. August rose by 0.03 pounds, to 7 shillings and 0.0225 pence. December rose by 0.0125 pounds, to 6 shillings and 0.0275 pence. Next March rose by 0.0125 pounds, to 6 shillings and 0.025 pence. However, because the Shanghai Association's allotment of foreign sugar was sold for cash, the market price dropped slightly due to the sharp rise in the premium. Spot 24 coarse white fell by 0.02 yuan. The price at this warehouse was 29.2 yuan, with 100 bags traded. The price at the other warehouse was 29 yuan, with a profit margin of 0.015 yuan, but no transactions at the asking price of 21 yuan. This warehouse's Great Golden Coin brand still priced the high coarse at 29.8 yuan, with 30 bags sold. Taikoo brand white fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan. The West Warehouse B brand was 28.8 yuan, with 100 bags. The CW brand was 28.5 yuan, and the East Warehouse was 28.3 yuan, with 175 bags. The West Warehouse CX brand was 28.3 yuan, and the DY brand was 27.8 yuan. The HX brand was 27.65 yuan, with 50 bags traded. The price of spot Dutch red rose by 0.1 yuan, to 19.1 yuan. The rest was unchanged. At the same time, domestic sugar was sold by remittance. Now that the cash premium had soared so much, and news of the Japanese army landing in Shantou had spread, the trend became even more chaotic. The asking price was reduced by 1-3 yuan, and buyers temporarily had no target to grasp, resulting in no transactions. Significant transactions had to wait until the financial situation stabilized slightly before there would be a real price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 825 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Beihai, and 3,050 bags were transported from Hong Kong, and 2,645 bags came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Fresh Cocoons Difficult to Transport to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The problem of transporting fresh cocoons to Shanghai, which has been delayed for nearly a month, is now expected to cause great concern in the future. It was previously reported that nearly 50,000 dan of cocoons from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang lines were expected to be released, but now a certain party is imposing even harsher conditions. It is said that the Chinese side insists on forcibly purchasing half of the cocoons with China Prosperity notes, which has made cocoon transportation even more difficult. According to recent news, 150,000 yuan worth of dried cocoons came to Shanghai from Jiangyin through a third country, but the second batch is unlikely to arrive. Also, 250 dan of dried cocoons were transported by train from the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, but they have now been impounded. It is also reported that the authorities in the guerrilla areas are now making every effort to persuade the people to transport all silk cocoons to eastern Zhejiang, and they do not sympathize with the issue of transporting cocoons to Shanghai. Therefore, based on this speculation, it will inevitably be more difficult to transport dried cocoons to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Yantai Shrimp Tails Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yantai shrimp tails continue to arrive. Due to lively sales, the arrival and opening of new shipments is immediate, and there is no accumulation. Yesterday, the opening price for Longxu Island tails was 129.5 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous price. Also, Yangjiaogou shrimp tails were traded at a price of 111 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Opened Coke Ash Arrives / More Than 6,000 Tons</h3>
<p>White coal ash, which has been sluggish in sales for a long time, has seen its calculated price rise daily since the foreign exchange was revised. The asking price has risen by 3 yuan, and public sentiment is expected to strengthen, appearing to be in a state of preparing for famine. A few days ago, Tongcheng Foreign Company on Jiangxi Road had 6,000 tons of coke ash opened at the port. The coke was lined up on Yangjingbang and sold to a certain company. Therefore, the market situation has stabilized, and the market is moving steadily. It is said that the price of opened coke ash is 22 yuan per ton. For those who pick up their own coke, an additional handling fee will be charged, it is said.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the Tablet into the Shrine</h3>
<p>Lord Qin Subo, the City God of Shanghai County, was a Jinshi (a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations) in the Yuan Dynasty. After the dynasty changed, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty thrice sought his services, making him a virtuous minister of his era. His tomb is located at Yubo Bridge in Pudong. Now, due to the construction of a new shrine, his spirit tablet was respectfully invited to be enshrined. On the 18th of the previous month, it was escorted from the County Temple with great pomp. All the clerks and staff involved were respectfully sent along. The procession went to the pier where they boarded a boat. Only the leaders of the Red Banner Society and other associations accompanied the tablet; the rest were dismissed. It is decided that the City God should be honored for the previous sea transport, which was free of any incidents. High officials memorialized the emperor, who bestowed the title "Ling You" (efficacious protector) to express divine favor. The conferral of this honor also extended to the Heavenly Palace, the Wind God, and the Sea God. Last year's sea transport not only avoided storms but also witnessed no moisture damage or theft by shipmen and sailors, which was unprecedented. This is attributed to the Emperor's great fortune and the blessings of the hundred spirits of the sacred crown prince.</p>
<h3>Surveying and Repairing the Yangjing Bridge Project</h3>
<p>The Yangjing Bridge on Sichuan Road in the International Settlement is a vital thoroughfare for vehicles and pedestrians. The bridge, constructed of wood, has deteriorated over time. The Public Works Department of the Western merchants estimated the cost of repairs to be 1,322 taels of silver for materials and labor. They sent a letter to the Daotai (local official), requesting that one-third of the bridge cost be subsidized. Following precedent, the Circuit Intendant Shen ordered the Sub-Prefect Chen Sima of the Mixed Court to convene with the Western Consul-General, who appointed Interpreter Yan to accompany Su Pai of the Public Works Department to inspect the site. The bridge is located near the mouth of the Yangjing Creek, with heavy traffic. The bridge deck is decayed, and during summer and autumn, it has been blocked for carts and horses, allowing only pedestrian traffic. The current repairs require replacing the bridge pillars, essentially rebuilding it. The original bridge pillars were six inches square, but now they will be twelve inches square, with twelve feet embedded in the soil and six feet above water. The bridge deck will be forty-eight feet long and twenty-two feet wide, making the project larger and more difficult than before. The estimated cost is unlikely to be reduced. The survey has been completed, and craftsmen will be hired soon. As the summer saying goes, "Girders are completed in the tenth month," which is the right time.</p>

<h3>The Awakening of Dancing Girls - Dance Industry Women's Association</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>Yesterday, the inaugural meeting was held at the Ningbo Natives Association. Mr. Yuan Ludeng was appointed as the Chairman of the Board. On Sunday, "Tears of a Dancing Girl" will be performed at the Carlton Theater, with ticket sales used to fund the association.</p>
<p>For so many years, those dancing girls who were seen as soulless and treated as toys have been allowing boundless pain to strip away their lives in the dark abyss.</p>
<p>However, pain is a kind of strength! Over these years, they have suffered from deception, oppression, humiliation, and trampling, causing a determination to resist to grow in their hearts. But this is not revenge, but their self-help after awakening.</p>
<p>"Liberate yourselves from suffering! Enjoy the freedom of being human like everyone else, and fulfill the obligations of being human!" They are crying out as they stand up in a difficult environment.</p>
<p>They understand the power of organization:</p>
<p>Their organization did not start today. In secret, several forward-thinking dancing girls have been promoting and enlightening their sisters who live in tears for one or two years.</p>
<p>With the help of people of social justice and their own efforts, the "Dance Industry Women's Association" was finally officially established yesterday.</p>
<p>In order to make this group a group of every dancing girl themselves, and to make every backward dancing girl participate, the organization of this group will not be as boring as other groups at the beginning. Although they will have literacy classes, the main thing is to use interesting, lively and proper entertainment (such as singing classes, table tennis teams, etc.) to attract them to participate. The purpose is to attract them from a decadent life to a normal life.</p>
<p>After they have developed the habit of collective living, they will be given some simple and vivid education that matches their lives, such as organizing reading and research societies, knowledge lectures, drama research, and so on.</p>
<p>In addition, there are volunteer legal advisers. When a member is really deceived, the association will send a lawyer to court to defend her. Of course, if it is extortion, the association will not only not send a lawyer, but also have the opportunity to advise her. There are also medical consultants who also volunteer to serve poor and sick dancing girls. In the plan, they also want to have a consumer cooperative and production technology training in the association.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the "Dance Association" was held at the Ningbo Natives Association at 2 pm yesterday. Although the weather was so hot, more than 100 dancing girls from various dance halls participated. Among the sponsors were Yuan Ludeng, Chen Heqin, Chen Xianmo, Li Wenjie, Zhu Libo, Jiang Yixiao and other than a dozen people.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the four members of the presidium (Wang Qinzhen, Ni Wenxian, Wei Chuyun, Yin Meifeng) reported separately, and their words were very painful.</p>
<p>At the meeting, twenty-one directors were elected: Wang Qinzhen, Yin Meifeng, Ni Wenxian, Yang Wenying, Wei Chuyun, Yang Wenxian, Zhou Huaying, Wu Ying, Jiang Yunlan, Zhang Lili, Hou Luomei, Fang Lili, Jin Didi, Chen Luying, Zhou Juju, Xu Huizhen, Shen Aizhen, Lin Yan, Yang Meijuan, Xiao Meifen, Jin Lili.</p>
<p>Honorary directors are social celebrities and women's leaders, and the chairman of the board is Yuan Ludeng.</p>
<p>If there are no accidents, after the performance of "Tears of a Dancing Girl" (directed by Xi Jianong) and "Shanghai Dancing Girl" (directed by Wu Cun) at the Carlton Theater this Sunday morning, their association's funds will be settled, and their association affairs will be launched immediately!</p>
<h3>Peddlers of Summer Medicines</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zheng</p>
<p>Pedestrians - Please Be Wary of Low-Quality Medicines Handed Out</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the most active and vigorous things are in summer. Now it is summer, and all commodities that are different from other three seasons will naturally appear successively with the advent of the hot air temperature. Because of the changes in celestial phenomena and the hot climate, summer is also a season with many diseases; therefore, so-called "Dan," "Sha Medicine Water," and "Plague Prevention Pills" have become the most popular medicines. From the standpoint of medicine, these things are originally used to treat diseases, and there is nothing to argue about; however, in Shanghai, it is a bit different. They are also used by ordinary people to sell on the crowded roads in a way of peddling for fraudulent purposes.</p>
<p>As long as we walk on a few busy streets, we will encounter these people. They wear long Western-style trousers, snow-white shirts, and hold many "Dan," "Pills," and a large stack of printed materials, appearing like a sales merchant. Mixed in the crowd, they first send a printed material to people. If people who do not know the inside story naturally accept it, but once you accept the printed material, they will use their eloquence to exaggerate the efficacy of their medicine, how old the brand is, ... with full patience, they will nag you endlessly. At first, they exaggerate and promote; then they beg you to buy; or force you to buy; if you still just say no, they will seriously teach you: Chinese people should promote domestic products. If you still do not promise to buy, then they will unceremoniously question you: Do you love the country or not? The words are quite embarrassing. If you firmly refuse, they will helplessly say indignantly: "China is going to perish! These people don't put the country in their hearts at all." The implication is that buying this kind of Dan, pills, and Sha medicine water is not only fearless of diseases, but also very down-to-earth patriots. This kind of statement, although too tyrannical, people with a little dignity will not bother to argue with them; the timid, seeing them turn their heads and scold away, feel relieved, and dare not argue with them any more.</p>
<p>From this way of peddling, we can know the nature and function of their Dan, pills, and water. Let's try to spend a dime or two to buy a packet to see what it is like. Although it is printed with the words "domestic product" and a description of being able to cure all kinds of summer diseases, the packaging of the crude package shows that it is a poorly made inferior product. It is not necessary to wait for insiders to study it before you can know. At this time of summer, when summer diseases occur frequently, it is really necessary to buy this kind of medicine carefully! However, this is not just about saving a few dimes from general buyers, but if ordinary people rely on this medicine to treat diseases, especially the rapidly changing summer diseases, the impact of the delay is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>For them, as long as they have money to earn, they have achieved their goal, and the quality of the medicine is naturally not considered, because they are a generation of wanderers, without money and without work, and the material on which they depend for survival is taken from the crowd of pedestrians. They peddle things that are easy to arouse the interest of passers-by at any time according to the needs of the season, but it is not limited to summer medicines. However, summer medicines affect people—to expand on that, they also affect society, making people unable to remain silent and making it necessary to expose them.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Why So Ill-Fated?"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>“Dark Victory”</p>
<p>"Self-sacrifice," shouldn't that be the highest sentiment among human beings? Yes, there should also be a condition reserved here, that is, this "sacrifice" must be for the happiness of mankind. The trick of harming others without benefiting oneself is only done by the ignorant to show off a momentary impulse, or else they are bastards who deliberately sabotage; but what about "self-sacrifice"? To dedicate oneself without wanting the benefit of the individual at all. Yes, this is the supreme virtue of mankind, but if it harms oneself and still does not benefit others, then this cannot be considered a great courage. People should live or die for the happiness of mankind, because each person is a part of mankind. Confucius blamed the wise, if only for "sacrifice," then objectively, it just so happens that it is what pains one's loved ones and pleases one's enemies, and invisibly increases the strength of the other party. The debate between "Mount Tai" and "Goose Feather" has entangled "experts" in endless arguments. I, the "audience," had a sudden feeling after watching "Why So Ill-Fated," and wrote it down to present it to the "experts" who call themselves "experts." To avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, I should solemnly declare that this is just a "post-viewing feeling" of an "audience," and I dare not consider myself among the ranks of experts, let alone pretend to be an expert and enjoy myself.</p>
<p>It seems that I am writing "outside" again, now I will pull it back.</p>
<p>After watching "Why So Ill-Fated," what moves people is precisely this spirit of self-sacrifice that makes others (of course, not enemies) happy. After Judy knew that the end of her physical life had come, if it were for herself, she could very well let her beloved husband stay by her side and then die peacefully, but she did not. She "feared that Smith (her husband, Dr. Steele) would find out and stop her from going, so she forced herself to smile and strictly forbade Anne (her best friend) from speaking... After Smith left, she went into the room and lay sadly on the bed, and from then on, her fragrant soul vanished." There are still some diseases in medicine that have no way to cure, which is one of the great enemies of mankind, and also one of the regrets, and the doctor's keeping secrets has become "justifiable lying." Judy went from being lost to discovering the secret, and from living a licentious life to really enjoying the joy of life, to calmly and covertly lying in bed, waiting for her last moment. This is a tortuous journey, extremely brilliant, returning to ordinary, and countless audiences are moved, sighed, and even suddenly enlightened by such a tragic story. Bao Yu's memorial essay for Qing Wen in "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Under the scarlet gauze window, I have no fate, in the yellow earth mound, why are you so ill-fated" is only enough to write about its misery, but not enough to awaken its theme.</p>
<p>Bette Davis, who plays Judy, is an actress who can act. The play is extremely heavy from beginning to end, and the emotional changes are even more complex, but in her performance, they are all conveyed, regretfully, the director is not strong enough, although careful and meticulous (such as the car and the servant opening the door outside the focus of the scene when Anne visits Smith), but the lack of courage and clarity results in each scene becoming weak, flat, and without atmosphere, therefore, the power of emotion is greatly reduced and weakened. "For any work, skill is secondary, and 'consciousness' is the most important thing," but if there is no skill, then "consciousness" cannot be conveyed, and it is also in vain. This is not necessary for "experts," just like me, a "viewer" with little reading, also knows a little about this monism. As for the high opinions of the "experts," that is what I, the "audience," dare not guess.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Red Makeup Avenges Hatred, Difficult to Eliminate Sins; Green Window Talks of Love, Remaking a Good Match</p>
<p>When Zhao Letian heard that, he also sighed and said: "Yes! At first, I was also puzzled after I received that letter from you. Because I wanted to know why you changed so quickly, a woman's heart is really unpredictable. I also thought that you were influenced by your family, as the saying goes, 'Those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black,' so you are hopeless. I was so angry at that time that I wrote a very long letter to you, and naturally this letter scolded you. I thought you might scold me back, which would also be very good. Who knew that you didn't reply a word, perhaps you thought that people like me were not worth replying to?" Pan Peiying wept and said: "Brother! Your words are more painful than stabbing me with a knife. Your last two letters were only discovered after my father was killed and I was sorting out his old documents. I think you also know about my father's assassination. He brought it upon himself, and also implicated his children to clear his name. After my father died, I have been hiding in remote areas, not daring to show my face and stand in front of people. Even if people are kind and do not criticize me, I feel like people are always pointing and talking in front of me, saying: 'This is the daughter of a traitor.' Imagine what time this hidden pain will be able to disappear! I have not dared to live in my hometown recently, because there are many acquaintances in my hometown. I am working as a teacher in a small school somewhere, and I don't dare to use my real name, I only use a fake name, so people don't know my details. This time, I came back to my hometown and accidentally went to Huishan for a walk. Things also happened to coincide, I happened to meet Yuan Shuwen, she asked me about you, she thought we were together. Only then did I know your whereabouts. The reason why I came to see you today is to explain the previous things clearly. If you hate me for not understanding me, I can't help you from hating me, I can't help you from understanding me." As Pan Peiying said this, she tried her best to prevent her tears from flowing out, but unfortunately, the tears did not listen to her inner commands and had to gush out of her eyes. A woman's tears have so much power over men! Pan Peiying's drops of tears hit Zhao Letian's heart, more fierce than the machine gun bullets when he was a machine gunner. What's more, they were originally old lovers who were in love with each other? However, Zhao Letian thought that Pan Peiying was probably married now, and the old love could be brushed off. Pan Peiying also thought that Zhao Letian must have married and had children, and established a family. Her coming here was only to express her heart, and after her heart was expressed, everything would be over. I will still be my elementary school teacher, and he will still handle his rice and grain regulation affairs. It is really the East and West Swallows, each flying away. (143)</p>

<p>The Arts</p>
<h3>Prelude to Skin and Yellow Charity Sale</h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Tongxiang Group will hold a Skin and Yellow charity sale at the Golden Grand Theater on the 26th and 27th of this month for four sessions day and night, which has been reported in this newspaper. This disaster relief campaign really started at the gathering of the Dafa Food Company invited by Zhang Xiaocang and others, which was at 7 pm on May 12. I also participated in the event. That night, all the heroes came to the meeting together, which must be recorded. When I went upstairs, I first looked for</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaocang. His "Ju Bu Cong Tan" (?) was published by the Dadong Bookstore more than ten years ago, and he can be said to be a pioneer in the opera review world. With a Changzhou accent, his stature and expression remind people of Cao Juren. Looking back, I saw the shaven-headed and beaming Luohan</p>
<p>Fan Songfeng. He is a famous Kunqu opera artist who has sung the "Chang Sheng Dian" Jingbian several times on stage. I quickly shook hands with him. Next to him, I found the famous young actor of the Xianni Society</p>
<p>Zhou Chuan Ying. He is elegant and completely typical of Suzhou people. Mr. Fan then introduced me to</p>
<p>Xu Heizhen. I quickly praised him for being able to play the cold play "Nine Pieces of Clothing" at the Hu She, his hair is already gray, but his spirit is very good; he talked excitedly about his wit in performing "Yu Bei Ting" and "Qun Ying Hui," and now I want to make it difficult for him, but in the end, he makes it difficult for me. He spoke vividly, full of interest. If it hadn't been for him that night, the table would have been lonely. Then came the "Qin Piao"</p>
<p>Su Shengqing. He used to teach Ping Opera at Jinan University. Because of the separation, I couldn't ask for advice. With him was his female disciple</p>
<p>Chuan Yunling. Soon after, the busy president of the Ju She came</p>
<p>Liu Juchan. The first volume of opera books and opera exams published by him in Taidong were attached with body movements or Gongchi. The later "Complete Collection of Si Lang Tan Mu" was even more complete. I have been at the same table with him twice, but because he came and went in a hurry, I regretted not being able to talk to him. Our table also came to the famous</p>
<p>Wei Xinlv. Tian Han once praised her highly. She is good at Laosheng, and she is natural and unrestrained, and speaks without restraint. She knew that I was from Sichuan, and told me the funny story of a former police chief in Sichuan: The chief loves to play tickets. When he performs, he orders the police to stand on both sides of the audience. If anyone shouts "Dao Hao," the police will stare at him and say, "You can sing, you go up and sing and see." The chief heard this, so he went to shave his beard and performed, saying in a Sichuan accent, "I sing opera just for fun," so he hung up his beard and sang again. With her was a famous female student from a national university.</p>
<p>Xiao Ming. In Beijing, she studied Huashan from Zhang Cailin and Yu Yuqin, and was good at Deyilu Thirteen Sisters, etc. After coming to Shanghai, she got the guidance of Hongdouguan Zhuren, and she was also very good at Kunqu Opera. Hongdouguan Zhuren once performed with her in Li Qi in Fan Ma Ji. I have seen her perform "Xie Zhuang" (Miao Fu Tanghui,) and her singing and acting are excellent, especially commendable is the body movement when she sings "When my father can't stand the five-torture torture, squatting down and embracing his arms with both hands." The latest to come was</p>
<p>Gu Zhicheng. He will perform Fan Ma Ji with Xiao Ming. He was originally at the next table, but later ran over to see me. I pulled him down and said, "You come to fight guerrillas." He nodded and smiled, sat for a while, and went to another table to fight guerrillas. Later, everyone discussed the opera code. Several people at the same table with me decided to perform</p>
<p>Ou Shounan's "Bang Da Bo Qing Lang," he is silent, gentle, and suitable for performing ugly roles. Also</p>
<p>Zeng Xinqi's "Kongcheng Ji." His shrewd and capable appearance, high and pointed nose, and bright eyes all made me misunderstand that he was from Guangdong. After inquiring, he turned out to be an old Jiangxi man. The one who performed with him was probably Fatty (my comrade)</p>
<p>Jin Shaogang. Naturally, he played Sima Yi. Wei Xinlv probably played (Li Ling Bei). Also</p>
<p>Zhu Boping played the Sheng corner of (Fa Men Si). Such a grand event is really rare! I hope all the great philanthropists will donate generously and come to the Golden Husband to watch the opera. I will take this short article as an invitation.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Tan Pai Beardsheng Yan Jupeng</h3>
<p>— Haitangxuan Lord</p>
<p>Tan Pai beardsheng Yan Jupeng, hired by the Golden Grand Theater, will come to Shanghai soon, the news has been reported in this newspaper. In today's era when Tan Pai talents are scarce, Jupeng is still a pride of the Tan Pai. He has indeed put a lot of effort into the art of Lao Tan, and his pronunciation is especially unique, which is recognized by insiders and outsiders. According to the background of Jupeng's fame and learning art, he has benefited a lot from Tong Wu. In the second year of the Republic of China, Jupeng worked in the Mongolian and Tibetan Institute. At that time, with the nature of playing tickets, he kowtowed to Tong Wu and asked Meng the first opera was Zhan Puguang. Jupeng played Liu Zhong. At that time, he was obsessed with Tan Opera. Whenever Lao Tan had a play, he would go to watch it no matter the wind or rain. However, because Jupeng's income was limited, the money for listening to the opera was paid by his friend Zhong Yuesen. The two listened to the opera, one memorized the lyrics, and the other memorized the body movements. Whenever there was a gain or a thorough understanding, they would ask Tong Wu for advice. Tong had a wide range of friends, such as Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, and Wang Yaoqing, who all entered and exited his door, so he could ask Qian and others to teach instead; Jupeng benefited a lot from the guidance of these three people. At that time, he also joined the Yan Le She amateur club. Tong Wu thought that Jupeng's voice was very good, and he should sing Gong, so he ordered to string Hong Yang Dong Peng Bei Er Jin Gong Tan Mu several operas. In the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China, Chen Yanheng was in Ping, and the two became close friends as soon as they met. Jupeng's Tan accent was further detailed by Chen, and his art was greatly improved. At that time, Cheng Yanqiu was very popular, and he performed in Shanghai. Mei Lanfang was also in Shanghai, and the two sides confronted each other strongly. Mei urgently needed to find an old Laosheng to support him, but it was difficult to find someone. Chen introduced Jupeng to cooperate with Mei, and Yanheng played the piano, which was the best of red flowers and green leaves; as a result, he became popular with one singing. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Jupeng went to sea as an amateur, and went to Jinan, Bengbu, Shenyang, and other places to sing Tanghui many times, avoiding double earnings. Later, he suddenly broke up with Yanheng and did speculation business, bought a large amount of public bonds, and indulged in pleasure. In addition, there were unsatisfactory things in his family, which caused his voice to become hoarse for a while. Fortunately, it gradually recovered soon. Yan's Tan Mu Ma Cao and Ding Junshan's operas do have unique aspects, which are beyond the reach of the current actors. This time he came to Shanghai to meet the ladies in Shanghai, and his satisfactory results can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Theater World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Fall of Woyun Jushi and the Rise of Li Duokui</p>
<p>One year, when he returned to Beiping, he occasionally performed in "Hua You Shan" (because Du Fen was also a *lao dan*). The temporary accompanist was Master Wu, who had been playing for Lao Kui for many years. Duokui had real potential. After the performance, he advised him, "Your build and eyes are too small. You are really not suitable for the Wang school of *sheng* roles. There is a severe shortage of talent in the *lao dan* field. Once Lao Kui dies, it will be lost. Woyun Jushi has become unbearably arrogant recently. I used to teach him many good tunes, and he treated me with respect as a teacher, insisting that I accompany him every time he performed. In recent years, he has suddenly become arrogant, looking down on everyone. He keeps saying that Lao Kui taught him so many plays, but how could Lao Kui have the time to teach people? Wasn't he just picking up the empty name of a teacher? In reality, it was all me who taught him. Now that he is famous, he doesn't even respect me. I am really angry and want to find someone with the potential (i.e., voice) to whom I can pass on all of Lao Kui's good tunes and his signature plays, so that I can vent my anger. My conditions are not too harsh. The most important thing is that the person I teach must always treat me with respect as a teacher. No matter how famous he becomes in the future, I must always be his accompanist, and he must not dismiss me and replace me with someone else." Duokui thought that Mr. Lu's words made a lot of sense, and besides, his conditions were not only not harsh, but also very beneficial to himself. To be honest, who in Beiping could compare to Lao Lu in playing the *huqin* for *lao dan*? Furthermore, *lao dan* is a specialized field. No matter how well other accompanists play, they may not be able to bring out the style of *lao dan*. Not only would he not dismiss him to find someone else in the future, but even if he wanted to leave and help someone else, he himself would not agree. Moreover, Lao Lu makes a living with his skills. If he teaches me the plays, it is only right that I support him in his old age, especially since he supports himself with his *qin*. After both parties agreed, Duokui wholeheartedly devoted himself to learning *lao dan*. Shortly thereafter, his sister, Liang Huating, took over the Zhonghe Theater and signed a long-term performance contract with Yanqiu. Duokui took this opportunity to join Yanqiu's troupe. (44)</p>
<h3>Obstacles During Filming</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>The losses suffered from sabotage by bad things during filming are significant. They may be minor things that don't interfere in other quiet settings. However, they are always cursed by many film directors—especially Howard Hawks, who recently produced "Only Angels Have Wings" (starring Grant, Carrel, Hayworth) for Columbia Pictures, and found it extremely difficult. He lists these troublemakers as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Song Flies: They can attach themselves to microphones without being noticed until the film and soundtrack are produced and printed. If the film is not discovered before being sent to the screening room, it has to be reshot.</p>
<p>(2) Airplanes: An airplane constantly flying over the filming location will interfere with the work below, wasting a lot of valuable time.</p>
<p>(3) Sneezes: If someone sneezes near the recording equipment, it will ruin the film and have to be reshot.</p>
<p>(4) Bird Chatter: Birds often nest in the rafters of the broadcasting booth. So the producer has to stop and have some employees climb up and drive them away.</p>
<p>(5) Stray Cats: Homeless cats will make the broadcasting booth their home, and their constant meowing during filming will render the work useless.</p>
<p>(6) Shoe Noise: Some insensitive people walk noisily, and these sounds will end up on the film's audio track.</p>
<p>(7) Visitors: Visitors to general film studios often don't understand the golden rule of maintaining silence near the recording equipment, and always whisper during filming, which causes great distress to the actors. (To be continued) (Reward)</p>
<h3>A Grand Performance by the Fongs’ Society</h3>
<p>— Ruo</p>
<p>The Fongs’ Society is organized by colleagues from the Fufeng Flour Mill in Shanghai. Although its establishment history is short, its achievements are already amazing. This time, during the Dragon Boat Festival, they held a rehearsal at the Ningbo Fellow Association, which was their first time. The society's rehearsal abolished the troupe system. The first performance that day was the "Jumping Official" by Chairman Ma (Luchu). Mr. Ma is the famous amateur Ma Zhishan, and he has a strong artistic interest and is also amiable and approachable. When Mr. Ma performed the "Jumping Official," the applause from the audience was thunderous, which shows his enthusiasm for association affairs and his popularity. The second performance was "Wan Hua Ting" by Mr. Cao Maoru, playing Yao Qi, with a loud voice, similar to Shao Shan. However, due to the heat and nervousness, he occasionally missed some lines. The "Qi Jie" by Xu Zhaogan and Lu Xizu, the female role singing was accurate, the Beijing dialect was fluent, and each had their own strengths. Others, such as Yu Xucun's "Qiong Lin Yan" and He Qin'an's "Kai Shan Fu," had no good performances. Shen Yongliang's "Kong Cheng Ji" had a very good stage presence. Sun Yixiang's Sima Yi, the two page boys were played by Ma Luchu and Cheng Peifu respectively. Both of them are nearsighted, wearing black-rimmed glasses, standing beside Kongming, which was quite amusing, while the old soldier and the scouts were also played by colleagues. "Gan San Guan" was performed by the famous amateur Rong Ruilin, playing Xue Pinggui, with a graceful and luxurious demeanor. Several *yuan ban* arias were sung smoothly and pleasingly. The Princess Daizhan was played by the famous actress Liu Huiqin, whose gestures and demeanor showed her cultivation. Cao Si's *huqin* accompaniment was seamless and moving. "Si Lang Tan Mu" was the last play of the day. Wang Xiaoshui and Qi Da'an played the Fourth Son separately, Wang first and Qi after. Wang excelled in singing and recitation, while Qi excelled in acting. When he was captured, he did a full "Diao Mao," which won a full house of applause. Miss Yu Yiyun's Princess completely imitated the Mei school in the slow tempo, and sang very steadily. The other pairings were also well-organized. The performance ended at seven o'clock. I write this in a sweat to record this event.</p>
