<p>各位同志、這一次全體會議舉行於第二期抗戰開始的時候、意義是非常重大、任務也特別艱鉅、我最近屢决指出我們抗戰、應該分爲兩大階段、自從廣州失守武漢退出以前是第一期、武漢退出以後是第二期、第一期的任務在於盡量消耗敵人的力量、掩護我們後方的準備工作、確立長期抗戰的基礎、完成我們第二期抗戰戰略、與政略上的一切布置、第二期的任務、就要承接前期奮鬥的成績、實施我們第一期中所布置的一切計劃、與發揮我們抗戰的力量、以達到抗戰勝利與建國成功的目的、所以這决全會、是我們轉守爲攻轉收爲勝、以我門的努力來决定興衰存亡的一個大關鍵、臨到這個存亡興衰的大關鍵、我們到會同志、就應該檢討過去的事實、確定今後的方案、提高奮鬥的勇氣以從頭做起的精神、脚踏實地、來貫澈到底、近來抗戰形勢、一方面我們軍心民心、比前格外堅强、內外情勢、亦是日趨有利、全國同胞、皆認爲我們國家危險、已經過去、對國家前途、非常樂觀、必勝的心理、亦更加堅强、可是我們本黨的使命、也就日益艱鉅因此全體同志、必更關心於黨國的前途、研究有沒有更好的策略和計劃、本席的意見、認爲我們革命黨的精神、是祗間我們本身做不做、就是問我們本身革命不革命、換言之、就是說我們抗戰不抗戰、如果我們能做、能抗戰到底、那就不怕沒有計劃、也不怕沒有辦法、要知道我們革命眞正的辦法、就是（以拙制巧）（以寡克衆）、本著我們三民主義向前邁進、我們如果能像第一期抗戰的精神、一樣的犧牲奮鬥、而且能更進一步、實事求是的做去、那麼抗戰必勝、建國必成、就毫無疑問、如其不然、或知而不行、或行而不力、或一時努力而不能持久、或開始積極而半途消極、或祗講形式而不求實際、或徒有志願而沒有確切實行的方案、或有了方案而不能勇猛的執行、那麼有利的時機、也就會較易放過、好轉的形勢、也將無補於事實、所以一切成敗興亡的根本、全在我們有沒有革命的精神、和有沒有必達目的的信心和决心、我們有了這個决心、纔可以根據决心來定出有效的方案、我們對革命救國、和抗戰必勝、有了堅强的信心、纔能够不怕艱難、不畏危險、來切實執行所定的方案、以底於成功、所以我要求我們同志、第一件事、就是要確决心和信心、决心和信心、從什麼地方生出來呢、就是要對我們抗戰目的和抗戰局勢、有正確的認識、有了正確的認識以後，决心纔不敗、血氣之勇纔可以持久奮鬥、到底不懈、有了正確的認識以後、我們的信心、纔是有確實根據的信心、纔能够堅忍不援、我們爲什麼要抗戰、爲的是我們要求國家民族的生存自由、要遵奉三民主義來革命救國、而敵人根本不許我們生存、更不許我們自由、我們此時如果不能抗戰、妄想中途妥協、這就是半途而廢、這樣、我們民族就要整個滅亡、世世子孫、就要永爲奴隸牛馬、萬刼不復、我們若不能抗戰到底、我們國家、就要淪爲敵國的奴屬國與殖民地、而且從此國際正義、根本推翻、世界和平、永無保障、我們總理一生倡導革命救國救世的抱負、都要付之東流、自從敵國政府和他首相近衛先後發表聲明以來、他這一併呑中國以獨覇太平洋侵略全世界的陰謀、已是舉世共曉、不待再說、我現在所要向各位同志講明的、就是敵國目前已經失敗、且有種種理由、證明他最後一定要遭受最大的失敗、我們祗耍奮鬥下去、就有必然勝利的把握、先就敵人方面來說、且不提這十八個月以來、他在我中國南北各戰塲上、死傷了七十萬以上的官兵、消耗了九十萬萬的戰費、弄到他國內羅掘俱窮、農工停滯、社會墮落、釀成政治上的騷亂不安、這些還都是有形的跡象、就是從他發動侵略到現在、一切戰略政略上的運用、以及對我們中國的觀測預計、和他對時代的認識來講、實在是處處違反了原理、步步陷入於錯誤、當此成敗利鈍存亡絕續之交、我要根據眞切的事實、爲全會列舉敵人必然失敗的事例、對各位同志提出詳盡的分晰報吿、第一、敵國這决發動侵略、人人知道是實行他的大陸政策、所謂大陸政策、依照他們內定機密的傳統政策、和他們公開的田中奏摺、是要先佔滿蒙、再圖侵略我們中國的全部、乃至獨覇亞洲、統一全球、但他在佔領東北尚未穩定之時、而就要來侵佔華北、他的力量、達到華北以後、又由慢性的侵蝕、變爲急性的鯨吞、於是公然來佔我們平津、這已經和他所謂大陸政策旣定的國策與戰略、完全是背道而馳了、不單如此、他還要再進而至於華中、甚至侵入華南、佔我廣州，這是他更進一步的來破壞他們傳統政策了、他進入了華中華南以後、不但戰略上陷入進退不能的地步、就是政略上也壓迫他不能不倒行逆施、與世界列强爲敵、陷入於四面楚歌的窘况了、這是他第一件必敗之道、第二、他對我們中國最初的企圖、是要不戰而屈、但我們終於戰而不屈、已經非其意計所及了、旣戰之後、他就想速戰速决、但自南口淞滬忻口南京、一直到了魯南會戰、以及鄱陽湖邊大別山脈之戰、一步步深入、終於不能速戰速决、於是反轉來又渴望速和速結、在我們未退出武漢以前、他的雜誌報章上、就竭力鼓吹中止戰事、或設法停戰、一面用種種狡計詭謀、想呌我們入彀、欺騙世界、圖取便宜、但是不久他又圖窮七見、拿出他所謂「興亞院」「東亞協同體二套很毒計劃出來、現在不但我們全國民衆洞悉其陰謀、就是世界上也灼見其野心所在、他這個、　圖、又明明失敗了、這是他戰略企圖上的第二失敗、第三、從戰略上來看、他不單違反三個軍事上的原則、而且更犯了軍事上三個大忌、　不知己不知彼、他始終沒有夢想到我國抗戰到十八個月之久、不但不爲所屈、而且愈戰愈强、他也沒有知道他自己的兵力、使用到某一稈度之後、要疲竭到以他五個入來拼我們一個人的地步、「在第二戰區有我方死一人而敵軍要死十四人半的統計」、　他一味希圖取巧僥倖、妄想以輕巧取勝、而結果適得其反、完全違背了孫子「兵貴拙速」的原則、弄到政潮迭起、反戰空氣日濃、他們所自誇爲唯一戰時內閣的近衛文麼、乃不得不因此下台、又證實了孫子所說「兵久而國不利」的名言、　古人所謂「頓兵深入」的大忌、原爲對强者而說的、現在他從東海邊頭深入到幾千里外我國的內地、使得他已佔領的地區、都變成了我們正規軍和游擊隊縱橫活動的勢力所在、處處要受我們的控制、時時遭到我們的打擊、欲進則愈陷愈深、要退則到處荆棘、這眞是做到了孫子所謂「鈍兵挫銳屈力殫貨」的地步、已經踏入了孫子所說的「諸侯乘其弊而起」的危機、簡單說來、目前形勢、敵人確已自陷於孫子所稱的掛形」的境地、眞所謂上不着天下不着地、到了「出而不勝難以返不利」的地步了、這是他戰略上最顯著的失敗、第四、就政略上來說、他對於中國、祇能拉攏若干形體不全聲名狼籍的敗類做傀儡、利用流氓土匪做爪牙、一方面加深他軍人的腐化、他方面更暴露出他種種罪惡與愚蠢、供舉世的嘲謔、而且不自量度、妄想他以東扯西凑倣效模擬而得的文化、來併吞我們中國悠久獨立的文化、以武力和政治侵略、來掠奪我們的經濟、結果不單弄到他束手無策、一事無成、而且反加深了他國內以下尅上的現象、至於在外交方面、他本來企圖緩和蘇俄、結果祗自形其卑怯、妄想交歡美國、更引起其反感、存心折散英法美的陣錢、而結果又適得其反、步步支離、處處矛盾、這就是所謂根本旣錯、枝節就一無是處了、第五講到他對於我們中國的認識、他旣不認識我們中國自來民族潛在抵抗力的雄厚、也不認識現在是民族主義發達澎漲而不可遏制的時代、又不認識我們中國歷史的眞相、他一味以遼金元淸自待、終以中國民族爲可欺可亡不成問題、而不知道宋明挫敗的主因、在於當年朝庭內極少數不明敵情不辨利害精神、受敵脅制、終於被敵欺誘降服、並非我們全民族的滅亡、現在敵人竟妄想在「建立東亞新秩序」的口號之下、於短期內遂行統制我們巾國的夢想、他全不想想他侵略我們東北、費了四十年以上的光陰、用了很大的兵力、耗了不少的經費、至今依然不能控制我們的東北、更無論乎統治、這種眼前的事實敎訓、他還不知省悟、反而要變本加厲、併吞我們中國的全部、甘蹈最近失敗的覆轍、這就是由於他根本不認識我們中國民族、不認識我們三民主義的力量、不認識我們國民政府的特性、更不認識今日的時代、以及今日中國的革命戰略與革命戰術、老實說、</p>

<h3 id="c2">日本長期作戰的把握何在？ <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>最近日首相平沼在衆議院中答覆各議員關於對華政策的質問，曾聲明日本决不變更已定的對華政策，縱使第三方面擬對日本施行經濟壓力，日本也已籌有抵制辦法。日衆議員之所以提出對華政策的質問，乃是表示日本人民對於侵華戰爭的憂慮和失望，而平沼所答覆的，却仍然表示日本法西斯軍閥要一意孤行。</p>
<p>日本以一小小島國，合本部朝鮮台灣和南庫頁島，不過六十七萬餘方公里的土地，九千七百餘萬的人民，農產礦藏都極稀少，她要維持對華十年戰爭，甚至百年戰爭，甚至不惜和第三國再來一拼，眞是在吠夢囈。在過去十九個月的中日戰爭中，日本在人力方面已有不能繼續支持的徵象。最近派遣來華的新軍，多是視力不佳的少年兵，各種機械部隊裏面，參雜了不少法西斯的歐洲同志。至於日昨所傳日軍部擬延長在華海陸軍服務年限，和近來日本積極招編中國流氓散匪，實行以華制華的政策，那更是日本國內人力空虛的鐵證。</p>
<p>在經濟方面，日本更是非常貧弱。今年初日本輿論界對於過去的日本經濟情况，曾發過樂觀的論調，並誇耀她經濟基礎的堅强，可以負擔「戰鬥的」或「建設的」兩重任務。這種樂觀的輿論，欺騙不了日本國民，也欺騙不了國際人士，祗要拿她最關重要的財政和對外貿易來說，就可以知道日本的經濟已到了總崩潰的時期。</p>
<p>先就日本的財政來說：前年度一般歲出及對華侵略費用的軍事特別支出，約爲六十億三千萬圓，去年度增至八十億四千餘萬圓，今年度據報載一般歲出爲三十六億九千餘萬圓，軍事特別支出爲五十四億圓，合計在九十億圓以上。像去年八十億的歲入，日本已有不能負擔的趨勢，以一般收入和支出相比較，每月支出超過常在三億圓到五億圓之間，日本爲塡補這筆赤字，祗好在公債發行，新稅增收，和通貨脹膨上，極力對人民加以剝削。可是這三項辦法，現在都已經達到了飽和點。去年四十三億圓的公債，僅僅售去三十六億圓；二億三千萬圓新稅的增收，已使人民認、「一菜一湯主義」爲奢侈行爲；年底二十八億五千萬圓的紙幣發行額，固然是造成了日本紙幣發行的空前最高記錄，實際上還有在中國所發的大量軍用手票和僞鈔，尚未計算在內。那末今年的九十億圓的歲出，在這民窮財盡的時候，恐怕除走向破產之路，再也沒有第二條可走吧！</p>
<p>再就日本的對外貿易來看；日本的對外貿易，乃是日本各產業部門的生命綫。去年前十一月出口二十三億九千萬圓，入口二十三億八千萬圓，入超一千餘萬元，日本認爲這是戰時的最好現象。其實日本這種入超現象，乃是她的侵略武力所造成。去年日本對僞滿華北等處所謂日幣集團的貿易，出口較前年增加百分之四十，入口增加百分之十八；但對歐美其他各國輸出入方面，都有减少，並且還是繼續入超，其惡化的程度，比較從前還要厲害。所以日政府感覺到統制貿易的力量不夠，還要提倡種種輸出貿易振興策。現在日本的對外貿易，輸出與輸入，在政府統制之下完全是以軍事的需要爲目標，因此大量黃金不斷外流，國內一般非軍事工業普遍衰落。其他物價的提高，勞工的失業，雖在經濟警察監視下，不能完全透露眞實的情形，但就所透露的現象看，也已有走向惡化路上的傾向了。</p>
<p>無論人力和物力，日本决沒有長期作戰的可能。日本現在所期望的，乃是一方面從中國取得長期作戰的原料和食料，如東北的石油與煤鐵，華北的棉花與羊毛，長江流域的米糧，現時都在儘量搜括中；一方面則希望繼續能將日本主要產品推銷英美各國及其殖民地，因而藉此得到英美各國對於原料及軍需品的供給。所以只要中國能夠在遊擊區域打破日本的經濟控制力量，英美各國能夠對日實施經濟報復，便眼見得日本所誇能夠應付長期戰爭的迷夢要隨着國力的崩潰而幻滅了。</p>
<p>從前拿破崙侵略帝俄、那時全面攻擊和長期抗戰的戰略戰術、還沒有發明、拿破崙以如此雄才、擁有如此大軍、尚且不免於覆敗、何況今天、我們是一個民國民族、精神普遍發展、舉國民衆、敵愾同仇、在國民政府命令之下、實行現代革命的戰略和戰術、任何武力、也决不能僥倖求逞、孫子地形篇有「知敵之不可擊、知吾卒之不可以擊、知地形之不可以戰」、之三大原則、我今再爲孫子續一原則曰、「知敵之可擊、知吾卒之可擊、知地形之可擊、而不知時代之不可以擊者、則無勝之道也」、敵人不知對方之情勢、允其不認識時代、更不待煩言而可明、祇就上而所說的五點、已可斷定敵人有必敗之理、現在敵我相持、勝敗異勢、敵之必敗、就證明我有可必勝之道、單就軍事來說、在第一期作戰的時候、是在交通便利的地帶作戰、他的陸海空軍與機械化部隊、可以進出運用、縱橫自如、在這樣的戰塲上、作戰到了十八個月之久、他不但不能使我們失敗、而且我們還愈精愈密、愈戰愈强、此後第二期作戰、進入到了地形複雜、山岳交錯、沙漠無際、交通給養皆極不便的戰塲、他的伎倆、當然更難施展、何况他全國兵力，已使用到百分之八十五以上了、大家都知道敵國的軍備、本來以百分之三十準備用於中國、而其他百分之七十、全爲備俄之用、今日他在我中國不僅使用的兵力、已超過了他預期的一倍以上、而且在中國死傷的人數、已經到了他全兵力百分之三十五以上了、至於敵軍詳細的數字、等到軍事報吿時、再對各同志詳細說明、各位看敵軍的兵力、使用與死傷、已經到了這樣程度、這就可證明他侵略的失敗、已經是確定了、而且以後的戰塲、彼我難易相較的話、我們一個子彈、至少可當作三個子彈來用、我們一個士兵、至少可抵敵人三個士兵的力量、而敵人方面適得共反、以後作戰、由我們這一年半過去的事實和經騐來說、敵人至少要以三個人當我軍一個人、要以三個子彈當我軍一個子彈來用、或許還要加多幾倍、亦未可知、所以今日問題、祗要我國不授敵以可乘之隙、就是最後勝利，確有保障、什麼是授敵以隙呢、我若精神受其威脅、意志爲所動搖、自甘屈服、急求妥協、那就是敵人所大欲、惟有這樣、敵人就可以解脫他無法自拔的苦境、補救他無可挽回的弱點、而我們國家民族、也就要自此永遠沉淪萬刼不復了、總之、我們能持久抗戰、必能得到勝利、如不能堅决抵抗而與敵妥協訂什麼和的、那敵人就可根據着屈服條的上他所享有的地位、更無止境的深入、到了這個地步、那我們中國就要在敵國所稱「東亞新秩序」「日滿支不可分」「東亞協同體」等等新造名詞濛霧籠罩之下、停止了呼吸、蔽塞了耳目、受盡磨難、歷盡犧牲、全部中國、無論何地、無論何人、都要受敵人的宰割蹂躪、萬無幸免之理、精神一被脅制、局勢立即變遷、而且屈辱條的一經簽訂、主奴名分隨之確立、這樣就無異於犧牲我們中國自己世世子孫未來的生命、反而去救了敵國的危亡了、（未完待明日續）（二十五日電）</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科楊道南</p>
<p>動物遭殃人類福音</p>
<p>內分泌學的進步，完全據於動物試騐的成功，蓋經過無數專家精心研究之後，證明與人類體質相同的動物，如猩猩，牛羊，海狗等之內分泌素，補給人體，確可達到返老還童，及開始攝取上述多種動物的肺，心臟，血管或肝臟等，以備在人體某部臟器發生疾病時以補給之。此卽現代震驚醫壇之內分泌療法是也。但此種發明，又經無數專家的努力改進，故無時不在迅速進步之中。</p>
<p>現在可專提出其有效成分，以供給治療上的應用。且在使用上力求簡效，由注射而至內服劑，求少量的藥劑，能發揮大量的效騐，始得造成近代內分泌學燦爛之境。</p>
<p>同時由多方面的實騐，確定睪丸中的內分泌其效力駕乎一切之上，因爲睪丸中含蓄一種成分，不僅能促進體力，增進生殖力，解除神經衰弱症，並有返老還童之功。</p>
<p>眞正睪丸內分泌製劑，祗有德國梅倫博士所發明之「補體康」一種，爲治療早洩陰萎，發育不全，婚後不妊及神經衰弱特效良藥，其餘不過借名號召而已。法國名醫佛蘭登博士會將」補體康」作多决試騐，證明其所言動物睪丸精質以猩猩為最多，猩猩之性質最符合人體，故藥性絕無興奮一時及刺戟腸胃之流弊，故得為促進肢體繁榮，返老還童最完善之製劑至女子可服女用「補體康」，能調經美色</p>
<p>此猩猩爲德國內分泌專家梅倫博士所畜，其所生子女，均犧牲生命於博士實騐室內，可謂彼之愛的結晶，均爲人類增進健康而捐體，宜其各國政府有下令禁禁止猿猴出境及獵殺之命令，蓋恐長此以往，有絶種之虞也。</p>

<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>國人因衛生智識，不能普及，一般人多因此而染上肺病。因此病極爲纏綿，所以又印上一種肺病難愈之惡劣印像。其實此種錯誤的觀念，亟須除去，以免反爲病魔所奪。其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，而相反的肺病實在個個都可治好，只要醫治和攝生得和，其他並無神秘。此余因二十餘年經騐所得，恒用「補肺拿爾」一藥，以搜癆補肺，鎭咳除痰，塡補肺臟空洞，不論病至二三期時之吐血，服之亦可絕對治愈，不過在治癒期間，宜安靜切勿勞動，並多攝取滋養料之食品，此爲肺癆必愈之條件。</p>

<p>淋病與房勞</p>
<p>在淋病未愈之前，其攝生一道，實不容忽視。就中允以性欲之攝生爲要。决爲飲食，勞動等，因爲淋病患者，爲對於此等場所不行攝生，濫行房事。則其抵抗力必益形削弱，而潛伏之淋菌，無不乘病人抵抗力削弱時，肆行爲虐，種種變症，胥由此而起，故未愈淋病，於攝生實爲首要，茲再申言之，蓋淋菌一物，頗富於抵抗力，而其在人體中，較之在試騐管中之抵抗力，更爲强盛，故雖在患者發四十度左右之高熱，猶能維持其生存。基於此項原因，一般表面上說三五日可以根治之淋病內服藥，顯多失其事實上之根據，而多失敗。且未經治愈之假性自愈，稍有怠於攝生，如房事，酗酒等，每至再發，後患無窮期，幸宜注意！</p>
<p>適應之醫治</p>
<p>余所遇者即恒見初患病時，濫服未經醫師介紹之劣藥，一時雖得小康之局，而每與妻子行房。因之遂爾互行傳染，永難根治。惟余遇到此等情形，必囑息者夫婦暫行分床獨宿，並同時治療，以德國靜電療法，及X線電療，以驅除淋毒，更內服淋病聖「克淋儂」，以肅除內部廣泛之淋菌，可在短期中奏效。如妻子已被染毒者，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，內亦指服「克淋儂」則功效之優異，允爲超出吾人想象之外。萬無一失診時：上午十時至下午六時，自即日起，每天送診廿號，每號僅取號金五角。</p>
<h3 id="c68">藥物化騐室中　談雀斑製劑 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 醉紅</p>
<p>雀斑是皮膚色素的一種變化。大都由於神經血管發生障碍而起的一種皮膚症。還是有擦用了含有鉛質的劣等脂粉。也同樣的會發生。一般年靑的少女。患了雀斑。偶然跑到藥房裏去買到一瓶雀斑藥水。結果雀斑却沒有除掉。反而弄得面孔紅腫刺痛。枯燥坼裂。這是因爲藥水裏面含有汞類和酸類的藥物。但是却缺乏充分的潤膚劑和緩和劑。而且藥水是極容易乾燥的。搽在面上。往往不等藥性的到達。藥水巳經乾掉了。同時因爲藥性的劇烈。皮膚上覺得非常的疼痛。所以雀斑藥做藥水。是根本不適用的。那末市上各種層出不窮的雜牌雪花粉。到底可以治療雀斑嗎？道是有一些使用雪花粉經騐的人們。大都可以回答的。雪花粉是天天用的。試問雀斑果能除掉多少？經歷就是答覆。事實勝於雄辯。雪花粉是硬脂酸和鹹性的化合物。只有白潤的能力。甚至有一些因爲缺乏甘油的緣故。潤膚的能力也消失了。美容除斑。眞談不到。美容除斑。一定要有美容除斑的藥料。决不能信口雌黃。就可以算的。那末像近時市上盛行的科學美容劑『面麗』。是吾也是雪花粉呢？不！絕對不。『面麗』的粉質潤滑柔細。不像雪花粉那樣乾膩凝結。這是表示『面麗』已經經過了一番提煉。加入了美容劑和除斑藥。而且在手掌上抹開以後。粉質猶可辨認。不像雪花粉研開以後。祗有一些水質。這是表示『面麗』眞實有美容除斑藥料在裏面。所以才配談得上確切的坊效。這『面麗』還有一點極可靠的保證。就是執有中央衛生署一二九八號的成藥許可證。化騐過裏面的除斑美容藥成份。當然比我們化騐的更可靠。所以談雀斑製劑。『面麗』我是認爲很有價値的一種特產物。在美容供獻方面。造成了最光榮的一頁。這似乎是不能吾認的吧！『面麗』的香味。以前已經有ABC三種的分別。最近又新出了D種香味。幽靜芬芳。比衆可愛。價値是比衆的高貴。一定是更加受人歡迎的了。『面麗』的製造者。是上海新藥界有名的同仁西藥社。各大藥房各大百貨公司。均有代售。</p>

<h3 id="c69">淋病之新認識 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　　黃仲昌述</p>
<p>淋病難愈一語，幾乎是普遍的呌聲，而實際上對於淋病之眞相，則了無所知，一唱百和，於是患淋病者無時不處於悲觀之空氣中，而任可惡之淋菌蔓延滋長，險症百出，此實爲對淋病本身無新認識，而只囿於舊觀念。更以落伍之治表療法，如宣稱三五天可治。一斑新問世之市上成藥等，實際上之效力，一如與過去一般無聊之成藥相等。原來狡猾頑治之淋菌，傳染力旣强，繁殖力允富，所以一般之內服藥，及其局部之手術，終難奏其全效。而必須有其包圍淋菌，直接置淋菌於死地之療法，始克有濟於事。</p>
<p>基於上述理由，德國淋病學大師彼德博士即首先根據淋毒非特異療法之原理，發明蛋白體黃色素混合製劑合成之「克淋儂」一藥，曾經用動物試騐，逐步改良，竭三十餘年之研究心血，卒獲成功，不論新舊白濁，衹須服「克淋儂」數小時，其殺菌功效，即由血液中發生，使各細胞亦起抗淋噬菌作用，故由淋菌所發生之炎腫，小便澀而不暢，淋系淋點，膿血交織之種種痛苦，即可消退，允其是淋病同時發生兩種以上之合併症，服「克淋儂」有同時治愈之效能，此爲「克淋儂」特有之功效。而非其他劣藥可比。並已獲各國花柳病院專科醫家一致承爲淋病特效藥，故紛在各大醫學雜誌上闡揚本劑功效之經過，足證其價値之優良，至於外用藥方面，據余之經騐，則「抗淋水」一藥，對於「克淋儂」確有相得益彰之妙。患者可按「抗淋水」之說明書在家自行洗滌尿道，以淸除粘膜上淋菌。女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，則　道內之淋菌白帶等，皆可一掃而淸。功力之勝，筆難罄述（按「抗淋水」中西太和兩大藥房均售）</p>

<p>— 潘序倫</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>民十六年國民政府底定東南，十七年全國統一以後，三四年中，內戰雖尙間有發生，然國內建設已漸合常軌。是時東南一帶，因厘金撤廢，稅制更定，紡織，水泥，橡膠，火柴及其他日用品工業創設漸多，加以國內商業科學之研究已較普遍，合理化經營之時機日趨成熟，因而工商會計之改進極爲顯著。促進是項趨勢者，會計敎育之普及實有以致之。按當民十六以前，國內大學及專門學校之商科，所用簿記會計敎本悉爲英美原版書籍，與我國會計實務，實屬格不相符。坊間所出書籍，又以普通薄記爲北，比較高深書籍，偶一二見而已。民十七年春，立信會計補習學校創立，十九年，拙著高級商業簿記敎科書出版，民二十二年，拙編立信會計專刋及徐永祚氏所編會計雜誌二種，創刋，至民二十五年北，拙編立信會計叢書，出版已至三十種，其他各家譯著，出版種數之多，亦在前此任何期間之上，而會計補習學校之設立亦幾遍於國內通都大邑。會計敎育，旣普及於一般工商企業中之會計實務人員，會計師業務，亦因商事日繁，日趨發達，（截至最近爲止領得會計師證書者計達一千五百人國內會計師公會亦已有十餘處）事業家遂多有改良其會計制度之必要，於是不僅規模較大之工商企業，紛紛改良其制度，卽規模較小之企業，聞風響應者，亦復指不勝屈。此種情形，至民二十六年所得稅徵收之實施而達其最高點焉。</p>
<p>按我國法令，如商人通例，公司法等，雖均有關於商事企業簿籍記載，損益計算，盈餘分配之規定，然十年以前，各企業因社會習俗關係，未能嚴格執行。十六年後，民法及其他重要商法先後頒布及修改，執行亦較嚴格，其促進會計之改革者影響已不在小。民二十一年，營業稅制頒行，因該項稅制以營業額為課稅標準，似於會計改進不無影響，結果因徵稅採用包繳制度，遂於商人舊習並無「抵觸」。至所得稅制頒行，計算應納稅額，一以實際盈餘與資本爲標準，於是良好之會計制度，不僅為經營與管理上所必要，亦為求納稅公平所必不可缺。各地商會與同業公會，於是會計敎育更趨普及，會計師業務日益發達，大學中學與夫補習學校學生之嫻習會計者，求業之易，直與大規模興建公路時土木科學生之爲入百方羅致者相同。稱之爲我國會計學術與會計職業之黃金時代，誠非過言。（未完）</p>

<p>邇來棉紗市價，日見進展，自本年紅盤開始以來，一月未滿，節節上升，二十支雙馬紗比去年歲暮之價，已漲起四十七元，且漲風迂迥前進，走勢異常穩固，市面之脚地何能如此鞏固，其中尙有原因在焉，茲將簡述如下：</p>
<p>（一）近來戰局順利，內地對於棉紗棉布疋頭需要，尙堪維持。</p>
<p>（二）自證券行市飄忽不定以後，一般金融殷富放出公債，套進棉紗，所以實銷雖則不暢，現貨籌碼殊覺枯竭。一</p>
<p>（三）紗布交易期貨市塲，自八一三抗戰以還，即吿封鎖，一般經紀人泰半淸閑無事，有一部份鑒於長此坐食，不是辦法，已改變宗旨，轉入現貨市塲經營，目標當然祇爲買進，决無拋賣之意，就此一來，現貨根子尤緊一步，且邵某邊某久寂思動，髀肉復生，近在現紗市塲，活躍異常，收進各紗允旺，而開進遠期貨數千包，足見其看漲觀念殊深也。</p>
<p>（四）棉花自被「日僞」實施統制以後，北方不准出口，來源斷絕，附近四郊，存底日枯，市價乃扶搖直上，允其粗絨棉價，新高峯層見疊出，於是乃引起投機家金融界及神經過敏者之猜想，搜羅之念，油然而生，故市塲時時耳聞某紗商受某銀行委託進棧單雙馬幾百包，市價加數元收進，由此市情愈逼愈緊，乃邁步前進，廿支雙馬紗價曾達四百零六元，穿過本月十日之高價四零三元矣，茲據市塲議論，多數意見，謂原料固無辦法，前途不脫穩境耳，幸印棉定價，非但不上漲，反見下挫，蓋以美政府囤棉有賣出之說，市價依然疲憊不振，歐洲局勢不寗，世界消費衰落，美棉價壓力之最大主因也，茲據調查所得，紗布倉庫中之現紗存積叉復二萬包，此貨皆係囤戶墊款寄存，以待善價出售。（A）</p>

<h3 id="c135">裘的古話 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 德惠</p>
<p>我國是裘的名產地，所以，穿裘的人很多。在古時候，裘的穿着，是有限制的。比如狐皮，非有品位的人，是不可以輕用的。據考證上，有「帝堯冬日御鹿裘」，「周文王靑鳳毛爲裘」，「漢武帝服西域吉衣裘」，「唐敬宗衣南昌浮光裘」，這些，都是元首服裘的大概；而其官吏的表裘，像晏子的衣鹿裘，陸遜的衣　子裘，張宗昌的得則天集笨裘等等。至名士的衣裘呢，有「王恭堂乘高興，披鶴數裘」，「嚴光隱居桐江，垂釣澤披羊裘」。雖有考證的，不止這幾個人，不過，上面所引，已有元首，官吏，和名士，差可代表古代服裘的一斑了。</p>
<p>至聖先師的孔子，大家都知道是聖賢人，他不但是喜穿裘，並且，還有美術化的設計；這在論語鄉黨篇裹，有這麼的記載：「緇衣羔裘，素衣　裘，黃衣狐裘，褻裘長，短右袂，」在這寥寥數字裹，其關於裘的怎樣置備，怎樣設計掛配，都面面顧到了。因爲是羔裘，所以配上緇衣，　裘來配上素衣，狐裘來配上黃衣，這不是孔子的美術化設計麼？並且因要適體取暖，常着褻衣加長，因作事要便利，把右邊的袖子略爲削短些，可見孔子是很提倡裘的穿着的。</p>
<h3 id="c136">西口皮與北口皮 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>西口皮的產地，是限於西北的，大槪不出靑海，西康，陝西，甘肅，寗夏諸省；而北口皮則是限於蒙古及東北華北各地的出產；就是包括着遼，吉，黑，熱，冀，察，晋，魯是也。</p>
<p>西口皮最著名的產地，爲靑海西康兩省，所產爲猞猁猻，綿羊，山狗，（貓豹子）西狐，草狐，麝鹿，狸貓，斑鹿，狼，旱獺，黃羊，大頭羊，虎，野馬等，中以猞猁猻，西狐，旱獺爲最名貴，草狐，狸貓，麝鹿爲决，綿羊，山狗，狼，黃羊，大頭羊等爲冉次；斑鹿與虎皮雖同爲名貴之皮貨珍品，但係屬於裝飾品。甘肅寗夏所產，則以大頭羊，綿羊，黃羊，山鼠，狼豹爲最多，特別是在額濟額，阿拉善，以及賀蘭山脈，六盤山脈一帶；每年的總產量不下於靑海及西康。但狸，狐，旱獺，捨猁，的產量極少。陝西以產旱獺出名，但種質不及靑康爲優，困爲陝西的氣候，較靑康耍和暖得多；其次狸，狐的產量較少，山鼠也多。</p>
<p>北口皮較著名的產地，當然是在遼吉黑熱的關東四省；除山羊，山狗，豹子，狼，虎，山鼠，旱獺，狸，狐，山貓之類外，以貂子爲最珍貴的產品。但貂子，在關東的產量，並不十分多，而在東蒙古，允其是唐努烏粱海一帶，差不多純以這種貂子出產著稱；但因其地接近庫倫與蘇聯，所以爲了交通的不便，過去運入關內的甚少。</p>
<p>在冀察晋魯四省中，產皮最多的省份，要算冀察兩省，特別是在冀東，以及察北的沽源，多倫，赤城等地；所產則以狼，豹，山狗，綿羊，黃羊，野駝，山鼠爲多，狸狐，旱獺等决之。</p>
<p>中國的皮貨市塲，以張家口，濟南，天津，西安，鄭州五處爲最大集中地，今五處已陷其三，而西安和鄭州的市塲，當亦不復如往昔景象，良可扼腕也。</p>
<h3 id="c137">簡便洗皮貨法 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 飛飛</p>
<p>皮貨爲冬令護身禦寒之佳品，其品類旣有粗細優劣分等，價格之貴賤自亦有逕庭之別；然擁重裘者原係一般有錢階級，雖云廉價貨品，至少亦須數十元，所以窮措大决不能成皮貨店裏的主顧。不過，如穿皮衣不在乎出風頭或示高貴，而只求保暖禦寒，則普通力量的人當亦能够買一件穿着的。因爲，高貴之細品如狐嵌，紫貂，猞猁，獺皮，灰鼠攤皮等，自然動輒須數十數百甚至數千金一件，那除了那些高貴的人們，怎樣辦置得起。但是同樣做一件皮衣，用的是普通羔皮或者是黑羊皮，那也是非常經濟的；上等一些的，所需不過二十元左右，下等一些的不過十多元。門檻精的，算計好的朋友，更會跑到估衣店裏去買舊貨來改打，如果穿得當心的人，往往一個統子至少可以掉換三四决面子，雖然後來不免要剪割去若干壞皮版，而再添一點新點零皮來補充，然而還是合算的。因此，皮貨在一般人中間，也還是一種經濟的體面服裝。</p>
<p>但是穿皮衣也應懂得一些收拾皮貨常識的，不然人壞一半，自己壞一半，好好一件東西，一定會因不知收拾而損失的　。這裏。我目將那簡易洗皮法及保藏皮貨法來吿訴給本刊讀者，以供參考。</p>
<p>白羔皮毛最容易沾垢發黑，而且毛色的光澤柔滑也會失去，於是穿了一冬或若干時候，便非洗一决不可了：然而皮貨究非普通衣服，皮版着了潮就要走硝變硬，一件衣服也就完結，况毛上之垢亦不易滌除；的確，一件任何東西，如不用水和肥皂，怎樣能洗去其垢汚呢。現在我有一法，頗爲便當，只須將欲洗的皮統，在日光下曝晒多時，然後輕輕拍去毛根中之灰塵，再用軟毛刷將毛絲徐徐刷直，那時就用噴器噴輕發油（汽油或松香水）一層在毛面上，須均勻，同時卽用老粉（向原料字號購買，的一磅）均勻地塗擦上面（如用英文粉或麵粉更佳），並用手掌徐擦，擦散後待其乾後即用刷刷去粉屑，復用手拍之使凈，如此的三决，皮毛即白，而且絲毫不損傷，惟洗後恐留異味，所以還須用輕發油噴洗一决，允其老粉飛入肺管，易使人咳嗽，故最好在洗皮時戴一口鼻套。至於藏皮之法，更其易易，但最好洗後收藏，俾免蛀腐，其餘如晒皮，放樟腦，及裝樟木箱等，自然也是避蟲之法；但樟腦着皮，也要受毀，因此在收藏之先，應將晒過之皮貨待凉後，搽以樟腦末，然後再將末刷去，祇留其氣性，裝箱時復用百部水洗箱，並在箱角內藏樟腦百部每角一包，那便萬無一失了。</p>
<h3 id="c138">大家來提倡皮貨 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 弓箭</p>
<p>冬天禦寒的衣料，大概有兩種：不是皮貨，就是呢絨。但是這兩種衣料，都是用走獸的皮毛製成的。所以呢絨又名毛織品。這裏我極希望國人大家來提倡皮貨，不買呢絨，他的原因有二：</p>
<p>呢絨是舶來品居多，皮貨却大半是國貨。雖然中國現在也有幾家織呢廠，但是出貨太少。假使大家都去購買，中國廠家製出的一定不够供給。我們只要看市塲上陳列的各種呢絨，差不多可以說沒一種不是外國貨。至於皮貨呢，除了極少的不普遍幾種外，其餘普通高貴以及合於實用的都是國貨。所以愛用國貨的同胞，與其買呢絨，不如購皮貨，比較靠得住。</p>
<p>呢絨是用獸毛經過一步紡織手續才製成的，它已經成了極細密的東西，對於保持身體的溫度，自然不及皮貨來得大。皮貨是用天生的獸皮製成，毛頭蓬蓬鬆鬆可以保存原有溫度；而且皮貨如果收藏得法，比較易蛀的呢絨也長壽得多。所以從這幾點看來，我們應該來提倡皮貨。</p>
<p>這裏我附帶來介紹一家信用可靠的皮貨店，他就是天發祥皮貨局，他有悠久的歷史，過去的優越，一般人都有切實的認識。當此春節將到，大寂都要添辦新衣，趁著現在該局正在出最後驚人　頭，很可以請過去參親參觀。</p>
<h3 id="c139">關於皮袍大衣 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>皮袍大衣，的確是値得提倡，一到了冬天，不拘你穿中裝還是穿西裝，都有缺點。穿西裝的人，在冬犬以爲穿西裝太冷，改穿中裝，但爲了平素沒有中裝，自內衫以至棉襖，都要新做起來，而且除了皮袍之外，還要做一件大衣。有一種人，爲應酬關係，除了中裝，西裝，還是罷不了，那不但要做中裝大衣，而且還要做西裝大衣。爲中西的兩種服裝，過一個冬天，要添製不少衣服，自然要支出一筆很大的費用。</p>
<p>因此，我曾主張過採用一種中西兩用的皮袍大衣，就可補此缺憾。我所說的皮袍大衣，式樣不妨西式，而比現在所時行的西裝大衣耍長。這樣你愛穿中裝嗎，祗要襯一件夾袍子或襯絨袍子；穿西裝嗎，也可套在外面。非但可以兩用，還可免去穿了西裝大衣，走到外面，覺得太短而嫌脚冷。就是穿中裝，爲了內襯的衣服較薄，也不會使你覺得太重而感</p>
<p>所謂皮袍大衣，用綢質或毛織物當做面子，而用皮做裹子，比普通的大衣當然要暖。而且我們大家知道，皮道樣東西，是非常耐穿的，上好的皮裘，可以穿三五個面子甚至可以傳代，父親穿過的皮袍子，兒子還可拆下皮來做過。因此，一件皮袍大衣，至少可穿十年，八年，至多面子壞了，另換一個，裏子是不必換。關於這點，也比緞子或駱駝絨做裹子要經濟。</p>
<p>由於上文所述，我們不難看出皮袍大衣的優點很多，特別是耐久，經濟，切於實用，而自有提倡的必要。皮貨店方面，倘能注意到此，請人設計製成一種便利而大方的中西兩用的皮袍大衣，使社會方面，大家知道它的優點而服用起來。這樣不但可使人在寒衣方面，經濟一些，而且還可使皮貨事業，因以發展呢！</p>

<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>一襲紫貂裘，是華省三家的傳家之實。華省三雖名省三，却不能如古聖賢的一日三省吾身，整日整夜的沉迷在醉鄉裏頭；一天不喝酒，就好像一天不能過活一般。他只要有酒可喝，任是醉死也心甘情願，大有劉伶，一死便埋我」的勇氣。</p>
<p>華家並不是甚麼豪富之家，但他的曾祖却在淸朝做過幾年大官，政績很是不錯，便由當朝皇帝賞穿紫貂裘，他老人家感激涕零，自以爲是生平最榮幸的事情；因此在八十歲那年壽終的當兒，就喚家人把這紫貂裘從描金箱裏取出來，鄭鄭重重的親手交與他的兒子，抖顫着聲音說道：「我的兒，這是老夫一輩子唯一的寶物，皇上的深恩厚澤，全都寄託在這上面。你得好好地給我寶藏着，一代一代的傳下去，也好呌後代子孫知道他的祖先不是沒有出息的。以後你們無論窮到怎樣地步，也不許在這件紫貂裘上打主意。逢到每年元旦或國家有大典的時節，特許做家長的穿着一决以外，平日間都得收藏在描金箱裏，六月大伏天，取出來晒晒，不可忘懷，樟腦必須多放，以免蟲蛀，耍是你們不聽我的話，而使這寶物有一個三長兩短，即我一靈不味，定要化作厲鬼來處罰你們的。這是我唯一的遺言，別的話沒有了。」</p>
<p>省三的祖父很能遵守老父的遺言，終其身寶藏着這一襲紫貂裘，別說元旦不敢着，連逢到國家有大典時也還不敢上身；除了大伏天連晒三天外，便終年的鎖閉在描金箱中，活像是一個徒刑的囚犯一樣。他老人家臨終時，也把老父的遺言轉吿兒子；說這是祖老子的傳家之寶，你定須把性命來保護着，否則就是不孝，就是大逆不道。</p>
<p>華家傳到省三的父親手裏，已中落了。窮秀才肩不能挑，手不能提，又沒有別的能耐，只索開了一爿子曰店，坐冷板凳過活。有一年大除夕，實在過不過那可怕的年關了；幾决三番打開了描金箱，對着那紫貂裘發怔，想送到長生庫中去換一筆錢來敘一救急，可是伸出手去觸到那柔軟的貂毛上時，頓時如觸電一般縮了回來，彷彿聽得他父親的聲音，在耳邊怒吼着，叉彷彿瞧見他祖父的幽靈，在面前出現了。終於長長的嘆了口氣，重把描金箱關好，掉着三寸不爛之舌，向幾家至親去懇求說情，好容易借了些錢來，拼拼凑凑的度過年關。可憐他老人家年年愁窮，不到六十歲，就愁死窮死了，臨死時，當然也將他祖父和父親的遺言，轉告省三，要省三像他自己一樣，任是愁死窮死。也得寶藏潘這紫貂裘。他老人家是個很細心的人，又恐省三不可靠，特地可嚀媳婦，也負一半兒寶藏的責任，省三的妻含着眼淚，一口氣答允了。</p>
<p>省三是個書香子弟，學問很好，只是名士氣太重，不事家人生產。他生平所拳拳服膺的，就是那「萬事不如杯在手」的李太白，只耍一杯在手，甚麼都不管。平日　仗着一枝筆，也能掙幾個錢，但是一轉眼就變做了黃湯灌到腸干裏去了。他的妻，倒是個大賢大德的婦人，常是苦苦地勸他，不要愛酒若命，磨折了身體。他却搬出酒祖宗劉伶的遺訓來抵制伊，說是「婦人之言，最不可聽。」</p>
<p>省三的酒量一天大似一天，而口袋裏的錢却一天少似一天，只爲一年三百六十五天，幾乎沒一天不是爛醉如泥，那裏還能做甚麼文章，文章旣不做，自然也沒有甚麼收入了，他的妻沒法可想，天天以眼淚洗面，一面很辛勤的做着活計，得些錢，維持他們倆的生活，而又不得不在開門七件事外，再買些酒來給省三喝。省三嫌伊買得太少，不够過癮，常常和伊鬧個不了。有一天趁伊上街買柴米的當兒，竟扭斷了描金箱上的鎖，偷了那傳家之實紫貂裘，向當舖子裏當了一百塊錢，的着他一班酒友，向醉鄕中討生活去了。</p>
<p>他的妻子回來時，見描金箱子開着，沒了紫貂裘，痛哭了半天，但也無可如何。等到夜半省三大醉而歸，總算在他口袋裏掏摸到了那張當票，忙悄悄地收好了，從此以後，伊一天要做兩天的工作，一些兒不敢放鬆。足足辛苦了一年，才額外的掙到了一百多塊錢，瞞着丈夫把那紫貂裘贖回，換了一個破箱子寶藏起來；心中非常歡喜，眼見這傳家之寶重又進了華家的門，這夜做了個夢，夢見華氏的三代祖先都來向伊叩謝。</p>
<p>滔天的戰禍爆發了，華省三夫婦的家鄕也不能免於浩劫。有一天省三正在酒店中買醉，恰恰飛來一隊銀灰色的鐵鳥，投下幾顆炸彈來，把道酒店和附近一帶屋子都炸燬了。省三的妻得了惡耗，直哭得死去活來，好容易從瓦礫堆中找得了省三那具殘缺不全的屍體，草草地在祖墳上葬了；就把那紫貂裘打了個包裏，用繩子縛在背上，星夜趕了幾十里路，投到後方醫院中去充看護婦，從事救傷工作，心想省三又沒有後嗣，守着這傳家之寶；有甚麼意思，就託人帶到都會中去，把它賣了幾百塊錢，一起獻與國家，換了許多寒衣，給前綫的戰士們穿，伊的心中，頓然如釋重負。這一晚伊又做了一夢，夢見華氏的三代祖先都在笑着—甜蜜地笑着。</p>

<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>英國前任外相艾登氏，是一位最愛好衣着的人物，他所穿的衣服，甚至一條手帕，都是摩登的，從來不曾服用過落伍的質料。顏色。式樣的衣服：而且所穿上身的衣服都　是整潔而挺的，一天到晚除了穿餐服之外，他至少要更換三套常服，而且連襯衫襪子都得間時更換。</p>
<p>某年的新年，他因爲要赴一個外交界的盛大宴會，特地親自設計打樣，囑成衣匠特製一身禮服，穿起來式樣旣大方，顏色又幽雅，無形地增加了莊嚴和崇高的風度，因此，有許多外交界中偉人都先後仿製，以至于把那樣的衣服呼爲「艾登式」，連禮帽也是「艾登式」，如今倫敦還是很盛行這種艾登式的帽子。</p>
<p>不久以前，曾有人對他的衣報數量作過統計，據云：他掛衣櫉裏的衣服，若每三小時更換一套的話，那末在八個月之內，所穿出來的衣服還不會有相同的式樣和顏色，這也是一個衣服上的珍聞吧？</p>
<p>我們聽到這種衣服上的珍聞，當然用不着以寒酸或嫉妒妬的口吻說他奢侈，因爲他沒有別種嗜好，所收入的金錢都可化在衣服上，何況他還有強大的生產力，更何況他還是一位富豪！我們如果有像他樣的聰明·勇毅·忠誠·偉大，也未始不可以穿那麼多的衣服哩！</p>

<p>— 何立三</p>
<p>際此冬藏之令，正養生家「及時進補」之候：然進補有「藥補」與「食補」之別，而俗諺又有「藥補不如食補」之說：誠以食補較爲實惠，旣得充口腹之欲，又有補益身體之功也。茲將食補之品，列舉數則於下：</p>
<p>杷子冬虫鴨　以肥大之鴨一隻，剖腹洗凈後，先加水煮沸一過，去上沫，加入陳酒鹽及南腿冬笋等料，再加冬虫夏草兩許，枸杞子五錢。置入塢窠，文火淸燉，至酥透爲度。庽藥補於食補之中，其味淸鮮，毫無藥氣味，大有補益肺腎二經之功。</p>
<p>陰陽膏　羊肉切塊，先煮滾去沫，又煮至半酥，加入適量之陳酒冰糖醬油。再和入發透之海參，文火緩緩燉爛。羊肉助陽，海參滋陰，陰陽兩補，故又名「陰陽膏」。</p>
<p>鮮牛肉汁　以黃牛肉數兩，切細丁，置入特製之瓦罐中。（藥房有售。）加鹽少許，隔水燉透。的二三小時，即成新鮮之牛肉汁，其補益之效力頗鉅。</p>
<p>鮮鷄汁　用肥大雌鷄一隻，剖腹洗凈後，置入大碗中，入鍋水蒸透。將黃色之鷄汁取出，加鹽少許食。其味鮮美，而補益力亦絕强。若用童雌鷄，切碎置入瓦罐燉亦可。</p>
<p>羊肉粥　以白羊肉和入熱粥中，陽虛之體，食之最宜。</p>
<p>八寶粥　以栗子，蓮子，芡實，紅棗等煮糯米粥。加冰糖，名「八寶粥」，功能補五臟。</p>
<p>鸚蛋牛乳　以鷄蛋一枚打透，牛乳煮沸冲入，大有補益之功。</p>
<p>鸚蛋豆漿　鸚蛋一枚打透，以豆腐漿趁熱冲入，其功不亞於鷄。</p>

<p>猪肉與魚類，各有其特點，分開了煮，固然各有各的滋味，而合在一起煮時，猪肉的裏面有魚味，魚的裹面有肉味，更有相得益彰之妙。譬如烏賊魚，單獨紅燒，或白燉了用醬麻油拌着吃，都是很好的下酒物；倘在烏賊魚燒熟或敦熟之後，再加些小塊的猪肉在內，加醬油筍片，一起紅燒，滋味很濃厚，把它下飯，是爽口不過的。除了烏賊魚之外，還有淡魚乾（據說就是晒乾了的暴醃黃魚）一種，也是最相宜與猪肉一同紅燒的，糖和醬油必須加得多，方覺入味，把它下飯，比了烏賊紅燒肉更爲爽口，本星期的菜單裏，把這兩種都加入了。</p>

<p>— 逃難人</p>
<p>在上海兩隻脚似乎失去了效用，因爲有交通工具——汽車電車黃包車四通八達的行駛着，即使二三里的路程，只要費掉三分錢，沒有五分鐘就到了，省力氣又省時間，當然是一般不在乎三分錢的人們所樂得坐的。固然交通工具對於繁忙的上海的人們有不少便利，可是因此也養成了人的惰性。而逃難是我們生活上改革的極大機會，就是四五十里路，在早路沒有車和轎水路沒有船隻的時候，爲了求生的緣故，跟着衆人趕長途的步行，到了安全地點，雖然脚上起水泡，腿酸痛了。在精神上覺得無限的安慰。可是過了十個月的上海生活的我，漸漸被風俗同化，往往行不到幾步路，就要覺得厭煩，但逃難的行的與趣湧到腦海裏的時候，那來往的汽車並不能引誘我踏上它的梯級，只是想着。仍繼續我的步行。</p>
<p>我回憶起：十幾天的在船上，毫不能活動，看見在岸上的縴夫和每一個行人，都要羨慕他們。我們於船夫允許下，才欣然的上了岸，好似囚鳥得了自由一般的逍遙自在，新鮮空氣，溫和陽光洗刷掉幾天來的煩悶，發在似的跟着船夫跑，（因他們走得非常快）經過村莊田野，然後走到高低不平闊狹不均的山路上，却不能奔跑，只能慢慢的走着。五色的野花儘我們摘，草的香味儘我們嗅，因貪戀山野的美麗，船夫們遠離我們到不能望見，因此就躭擱了他們的行程，在催促下，我們很不願的回上了船。</p>
<p>在一個鄕村中，我們平安的居住着。可是引火柴必須自己去採摘，因此養成我們負物行路的習慣。那曲折的小徑，山坡的小路，是我們所熟悉的。在起初不免有些膽怯，懷疑在這荒僻山上有沒有虎窟，在幾决上山後，山下的柴火不能滿足我們的慾望，於是爭上高處拾取，等到滿載而歸，全身出汗，這對於逃難人在冬天感到需要的。所以每在柴少天寒時，相率上山，那幾里平路，和傾斜的山路，對於我們並不覺得什麼困難。</p>
<p>當我走在平坦的水門汀的人行道上，回想到這些事，不再厭惡路程的遠而長，在前面雖然沒有五色的野花，奇麗的山峯更沒有滿載而歸的快活，可是橱窗裏各式不同的佈置，三分錢的節省，全身發熱，不是一樣的嗎？於是並不勉强的向前走，到了終點後，他們都在呌冷，而我連忙脫着外衣，在他們問我時，就笑着說：「這就是行路的益處啊！」</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>——戰地旅行雜感</p>
<p>友人珂雲有一篇「廢墟落日」的戰地報告文，寫那天在刦後台兒莊郊外蒼茫夕照中的情況，結末一節寫道：</p>
<p>從麥田中繞回城內，有一狗屍，躺在斜坡上；相離數十步，又有一敵屍，仰臥在泥地上，上身掩蓋著黃泥，只剩兩腿露在外面，腳上還套著膠皮靴。一抹落日的餘光從他的身上掠過。</p>
<p>這印象在我們的心頭不時浮了起來：而敵兵一首詩：</p>
<p>我們為什麼而戰？</p>
<p>支那人受了磨刦，</p>
<p>我們也遭了災難，</p>
<p>天哪！天哪！</p>
<p>誰來收拾我們的殘骨？</p>
<p>也時響在我們的耳邊。這詩的情調和「蒼茫落照」的情調會這麼和諧，在我們那一剎那的靈感上覺得非常驚異。有一天晚上，我獨自在上饒北門外看落日，又觸起這一番景象，忽覺得這情調實在太熟習了；我恍然大悟，這是世紀末的情調。——貫徹敵人一切用文字來記戰的詩文中的基本情調。</p>
<p>昨天忽翻開日本空海和尚所作伊呂波歌歌句云：</p>
<p>紅紫芳菲兮飄零奈何？</p>
<p>徧觀人世兮常住幾多，</p>
<p>幻境沈迷兮而今超過，</p>
<p>殘夢巳醒兮弗醉弗魔。</p>
<p>原來瀰漫於日本民族心理上的，就是這一套世紀末的情調。語云：「日暮途窮，倒行逆施，」日本軍閥的侵略狂，原來只是一種世紀末心理所演奏的倒行逆施篇。</p>
<p>日本軍閥每一個人，都是弗洛乙德的精神病院中的好材料：這句話，我們站在日本民眾那一邊，除去一切民族偏見，纔能深切地理解。在日本那一方面，雖說有「日出之國」或「朝日」這一類自況的詞句，但支配日本這國家命運的貴族與軍閥，無論就這制度的本身或就××這系統講，都已臨到了「落日」或「世紀末」的命運了。</p>
<p>中日戰事的結局，會變成怎樣一個局面，日本的室及軍閥都已深切地知道了：這戰事決不會給日本民眾以黑色的命運，日本×室及軍閥卻將與德俄××室把臂進博物院去，這是日本軍閥各式掙扎姿態的總說明。</p>
<p>當歐洲大戰初起時，沙皇簽定宣戰書那一剎那，他非常悲慘地說，「對我的可怕的試騐是決定了，可是我這一世得不到報償的了。」從歐洲大戰過程中，解放了舊俄地獄下的民眾，結束了沙皇這一系統的命運：真使××對落日而激起怎麼的戰慄喲！　一月二十日</p>

<p>— 岳彬</p>
<p>一月天——蔚藍，平靜得像一片水。</p>
<p>冬天的風在這裏仍是那麼柔軟，太陽照耀著，大地更顯得熙和。</p>
<p>在黃沙路上，我們一夥兒三個，懷著興奮的情緒，向著前途邁步著。</p>
<p>塵沙被急促的步子直掀得飛揚起來，右邊的溪水淙淙地在流；在遼遠的雲底下蓮花山模糊地正顯得秀麗；遠處的新興城市——汕頭——在這裏望著是夠偉大的。</p>
<p>這地方，呌做十埭鄉。</p>
<p>我們都是從十八歲到二十五歲的耕田的小伙子，這時刻，我們剛做完了佃工，趕上鄉公所抽簽去當社丁。</p>
<p>這一次，已經是第四期了，上三期應徵，我們都落了空，大家悵惘——每次，看著壯丁們操練得那麼有神，值得忻羨。</p>
<p>因而，這一次，我們都期望著：「我們該抽著了」。</p>
<p>轉了灣，經過大生哥的甘蔗田——一月裏的甘蔗已是長得高高，密密的了。</p>
<p>在我後面的阿炳突然迅速地跑進那甘蔗田裏去，隔了一會，拿著一枝甘蔗出來。他先拍去了蔗上的葉子，然後，把蔗掮著像拿步槍般的，挺起了胸，用著跑步的步伐，向我們一邊跑過來。</p>
<p>「一，二，一，……哈哈！大生哥，我這樣可像一個已經訓練過的壯丁？」說著，他又伏在地上，用蔗對著我們做射擊的姿勢。</p>
<p>「阿炳，不要白開心，這一次準又挨不到你的份。」大生哥說完，我們又邁開了腳步前進著。</p>
<p>阿炳拍去了身上的黃泥，把甘蔗折成二段，剝去了葉，吃著趕上來。對著大生哥，他把手拍著胸，又把大拇指翹得高高地：</p>
<p>「哼！這次我準變成壯丁給你看。」是蠻起勁的。</p>
<p>我覺得這是夠忻躍的，在戰前，我們一聽著，「徴壯丁」，便老早地逃避到親戚家去；然而，現在我們都爭著要當壯丁了。</p>
<p>進了鄉村，走上鄉公所，那是一個祠堂改成的——天井，外是廣闊的，已經立著近百人，大家都現著興奮的微笑。（雖然，為著生活，有的還會憂愁著臉。）</p>
<p>人圍成了一個大圈，鄉長，里長，公平人都立在中間的四方桌邊。大家的注意力都集中到桌上那個圓筒。</p>
<p>我們擠了進去，阿炳卻把我的衣角拉了一下，輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「人又是這麼多，一共只抽取五名，怕又挨不到我們的份了。」</p>
<p>突然，大家都靜寂起來——抽籤開始了。</p>
<p>於是，公平人按著應徵壯丁名單呌著：</p>
<p>「×××」</p>
<p>另一個公平人便隨即用筷子向圓筒內夾上一粒紙團，拆開來看後便呌著：「無」或者是「有」</p>
<p>時間過著，已決定著命運的便逐漸離開這裏。突然，阿炳把頭頸伸得長長地，注聽著，然後，看他臉上現出了笑容——我們都聽見一個聲音「有！」</p>
<p>另一個公平人便把「李阿炳」的名單寫上壯丁簿了。……</p>
<p>人已是星散了，我和大生哥又是落空！</p>
<p>走出了鄉公所，腳步響得沉重了；「迷惘」總會在我和大生哥的腦海裏閃著：「啊！又得隔一月後才能再抽簽。」</p>
<p>阿炳卻特別活躍起來，他說著健民哥是怎樣瞞著妻，母去從軍；素文姑娘是怎樣勇敢地去當女壯丁；臉上，又漲起了青筋：</p>
<p>「等得這期訓練了插進軍隊去；那時，哼！李阿炳把你這那些赤老就是一刀……」！　　他對著大生哥的頸間猛地用掌劈下去，但給大生哥的手用力捏住了，阿炳只痛得亂嚷著。</p>
<p>大家又相對地笑著，望著遠處山水模糊，心境是靜靜的，——但血又奔騰起來——確信著：我們遲早都會成為壯丁隊員；會在沙場馳驅的。</p>
<p>已經是黃昏了，天給黯淡籠罩著，但這裏的大地，卻仍然是美麗的。……</p>

<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>自羅斯福總統上台以來，他的最大一個政策，就是舉世所知的新計劃運動（New　Deal　Progress　Adminis　tration美國公共事業振興局），也就是新計劃運動的一個分野。</p>
<p>WPA在藝術方面所包含的工作計有：</p>
<p>FAP（Federal　Art　Project聯邦美術設計。）</p>
<p>FMP（Federal　mnsie　Projest）聯邦音樂設計。</p>
<p>FTP（Federal　The　ater　Project聯邦演劇設計。）</p>
<p>FWP（Federal　Writers＇Project）聯邦作家設計。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統標榜其新政策時，就設立有一個公共事業局（Publie　Works　Administration—簡稱PWA），而WPA就是直接隸屬於該局。當初設立公共事業局的目的，本在救濟失業者，所以隸屬其下的一切分野工作，亦均以救濟失業為目標。WAP自然亦不能例外，但至今日，若把WPA下面的四大藝術工作，再觀作目標在於救濟失業，那就錯了。因為這種藝術運動，今日已發展了他們獨立存在的意義，這里將四大藝術運動的近況，簡述如下：</p>
<p>FAP的新藝術運動——FAP作品的特點，就是不再以美術家或美術愛好家為作品的目標，而是以國家共同體的藝術立　，直接描寫美國民眾的生活。</p>
<p>在初期，美術家的思想自由，尚偏頗於社會主義的解釋，例如紐約洛克費勒中央大廈的　畫，會由但高，李佛拉描畫了一幅列農像，一時頗遭物議。後來這像是撤回了，但李佛拉在別處的作品，仍舊為人所接受。</p>
<p>因為沒有畫廊，所以在從事壁畫工作以外，他們又在美國的南部，中西部及西部成立了幾十個畫廊，陣列名家和當地畫家的作品，每天開放到夜上九時，一面造成新的鑑賞羣眾，同時又復給地方畫家指導，所以這一運動已成了個別的文化運動，而不復是單純的失業救濟了。</p>
<p>FTP的演劇運動——這一運動的名義上的管理者是亨利，霍夫金斯，實際指導者乃係愛侖，烏特海特夫人及亨利，佛拉娜茄夫人兩人。在最初兩年間，支付經費達千三百四十萬美元，最多時參加者有一萬二千五百人，現在則為九千人。因若干州內現在不僅感到本州失業劇員的不夠雇用，且還到他州去借。</p>
<p>FTP　關於觀眾要求的複雜以及演員才能的各有特長，所以在其上演目錄上，自希臘的古劇至今代的化裝劇，備有二萬八千種，包含沙氏比亞劇，社會劇，默劇，舞劇等各方面。</p>

<p>腥風血雨的時代，是不容許釋迦牟尼來倡行那些使人類可以成佛的說法的，因為「放下屠刀，立地成佛，」這類腐調已絕對不適於這個時代。很明顯的，今日的中國，是一切興衰的劃界，也是一切生死的關頭，為了要爭取全民族所需要的需要，自然不得不開始著民族鬥爭的大屠殺。我們要從大屠殺中開闢出新生的道路來。中國目前屠殺的對象有二：一是毀滅全人類的勁敵，一是剷除全民族的敗類；而這兩點也可說：前者對外，後者對內。</p>
<p>然而，殺人的工具是些什麼呢？</p>
<p>無疑地，戰士掌中的是刀是槍，是鋼鐵與硫磺；而文人手裏的卻唯有長僅寸許的一個筆尖了。</p>
<p>別以為筆是一種毫無能為的東西，它衹能寫寫西廂，寫寫紅樓夢，寫寫金瓶梅，寫寫微笑的渦，寫寫三角式的男女羅曼史；同樣地，它也可以殺人。歷史上的筆，本來早被運用做了殺人的工具，那時筆的殺人工作也許就稱為筆誅。不是嗎？「別人懷寶劍，我有筆如刀，」說得多麼響亮而痛快？</p>
<p>可惜歷史上的筆雖能殺人，但所殺的對象不廣也不多；被殺者的罪狀又不分明，甚至錯辦是非，竟有誤殺。此外因為殺得不得其法，致未能演個淋漓盡致，大快人心，更是常有的事。這些都是筆的錯誤嗎？自然不是，衹因運用它的人缺少一點觀察，缺少一點技巧罷了。所以，筆雖然可以被當作殺人的利器，問題還在於執筆的人底本領；其情形相似：任何刀槍都能致人死命，而最後的關鍵得瞧劊子手所採取的殺人的手法。</p>
<p>現在，鮮血染遍了河山，大屠殺早已開始。或對外，或對內，凡是黃帝的子孫都應該站穩自己的崗位，執行這種神聖的任務。那末站在文化前哨的作者們，更不該忘了以筆代刀的責任了！</p>
<p>瞧：那些沐猴而冠的東西；那些搖頭擺尾的東西；那些扮鬼作怪的東西；以及望去儼然像人而實非人的東西……全得利用鋒利的筆尖，剖開他們的腹，揭穿他們心腸內的秘密；砍下他們的頭，傾出他們腦袋裏的黑幕，作者們必須絕對的利用了筆，使一切醜妖怪魔見了它就現原形，從此不敢猖獗，讓筆替民族鬥爭的大屠殺上添演一些歷史的功勳，同時讓筆在中國文化的旅程上也培植一點燦爛的點綴！</p>

<h3 id="c152">劇作者與演藝者 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 李阿毛</p>
<p>劇作者與演藝者，這兩種人，是應當聯合着進行，萬萬分不開的，好比車子的有兩個輪，缺了一面，就難以行動。</p>
<p>所以世界各國。這劇作者與演藝者，無不相輔而行，中國亦然，古時如此，最近也如此；不過中間有六七十年，是劇作者與演藝者，完全背道而馳的。</p>
<p>中國古時，戲劇最盛行，當然是元代。那時的戲蝨，就是現在所謂元曲了，也就是現在的崑劇。崑劇的曲本，詞句很高，自然非有相當文學修養的，不能下筆；但是雙方合作的條件，倒很容易，本子上，只把那唱句說白，寫了出來，交給戲班子裹，他們就會表現，一切動作表情，都是他們自己用經騐與技術去對付的。至於唱詞，只消有了曲牌名，也就有辦法，所以在崑曲盛行的時代，大的從元代至前淸洪楊時代爲止，這幾百年間，雙方都是這樣合作的，劇作者沒有伶人，他的著作，僅不過供人紙上欣賞罷，伶人沒有劇作者，就不會有新的東西出來。</p>
<p>但崑劇曲高和寡，只能供知識階級的觀賞，决不是大衆的，所以他的壽命，到底不能長久，後來便受了通俗的徽劇和京劇的革命，弄得風雨飄搖了這種通俗東西一流行，便沒有劇作家揷足的餘地，那些粗俗的句子，伶人們自已都會對付，自然沒有劇作者的需要，因此，劇作者與演藝者，雖如唇齒相依，在這一個時代，是完全脫離關係了，換一句說：就是沒有劇作者的存在了。</p>
<p>即使有一二文人，偶然高興，要寫一本劇本給他們，他們拿去，也完全不能用。因爲他們的一向的辦法，凡是編一本新戲，也用不着什麼劇本，單單寫一張「提綱」，這「提鋼」上面，僅不過寫出各塲的人名罷了，一些劇情也沒有，祇靠排戲的人一張嘴，用內行的口吻，講給他們聽，就可以行了。所以斷不是外行可以幹的。假使一個外行要替他們排戲，那就困難很多，譬如說：第一塲，某人上塲。那伶人就問：我怎麼樣的上塲？還是急急風？還是水底魚？還是打引子？還是唱？還是小鑼？他說出種種名堂來，早把編劇人嚇呆了。萬一有幾個人，以爲這外行，是要來奪內行飯碗的，那更不免有吃豆腐等事情發生。如果一位劇作者，一定要打算跟他們編戲，那就非自己先去做成功一個內行不可；但這不是容易的事，所以這一種可稱很少很少，我們只看見了一個歐陽予情。</p>
<p>劇作者與演藝者，天然是相輔而行的，那裏可以不合作呢？近來舊劇的沒有進步，原因大半在此。允其是在上海，舊劇與好萊塢的影片，同時放在觀衆面前，思想上比較起來，自然差得太多了。</p>
<p>不過在最近，話劇與電影盛行，道兩種東西，他們完全和劇作者合作的，根本上他們非有好的劇本，就不能成立，所謂好的劇本，並不是塲面的變幻，乃是思想的如何。有了良好的劇本，那演藝的人，才有了根據，可以發揮他們的天才和經騐，演藝者能了解劇本的精神和意議，便成好戲。雙方愈合作，成績愈佳。</p>

<p>— 宣</p>
<p>生氣蓬勃的發展着　是惟一新型的劇場</p>
<p>戲劇雖是一種藝術，但在另一方面講米，它又是社會大衆所需要的高尙娛樂，因此，無論那一種戲劇，應從改進社會，糾正一切不良的風俗習慣爲前提，成爲益智養身的高尙娛樂；務使觀衆們，化極微少的代價，得到娛樂的眞意，筆者是愛好話劇的，所以乘興來談談話劇。</p>
<p>海上的話劇塲所，不能說少，可是要找一個雅俗共賞而又差强人意的地方，那就不容劇塲」開慕以後，爲海上話劇界放了一個異彩，可說是上海新型的話劇塲，所以我興奮地接連看了好幾次，總算沒有使</p>
<p>無論那一個公共娛樂塲所，要眞能够得一聲好譽，那决不是僅憑片面的宜傳，或是少數人主觀的濫捧所能倖致，它是要表現給大衆的面前去有目共賞。所以現在的「綠寶劇塲」它已經有了光明燦爛的地位，和生氣蓬勃的發展了。「綠寶」之能有今日這樣的成績，照我看來，大概是下列兩種原因：</p>
<p>第一：是主辦當局服務社會精神的偉大。「綠寶」是新新公司主辦的，因爲資本的雄厚和地方的適宜，一切設備都遠駕其他劇塲之上，當然能够吸引觀衆，再加上該公司管理又嚴密，所以對於座位，佈景，燈光，道具，各方面都很令人滿意，這一點誰都公認的。現在到處都鬧着劇本恐慌，「綠賓一能以簇新的姿態，選演新編名劇，睥睨全上海話劇界，這是它的特點。</p>
<p>第二：是劇團人材的優秀整齊——「綠寶」的後臺是公司當局委託陳秋風，王曼君，劉一新三君共同負責，他們全是劇藝界的全材，在聰明的設計和領導之下，使全體演員都有充份地發展個性表演的機會，所以每齣戲，都得到維妙維肖的收穫。演員方面，男的如劉一新，王曼君，顧夢鶴，秦哈哈，田曉靑，胡了然，王山樵，羅飛，胡士奇，等各有所長。女角如范雪朋，錢愛麗，田心，王　冰，王愛娜，蔡娟娟，呂　萍，李萍，錢　貞，錢慧霞等，或風韻天生，或姣豔溫雅，或端莊沉靜，或嬌小玲瓏，或天眞爛漫，胥爲不可多得之人村。</p>
<p>「綠寶劇塲」具備以上兩種原因，所以它的成就也突飛猛晋，現在「綠寶」兩字已深印入滬上仕女的腦海了，它已成爲海上的話劇的權威，足可傲視儕輩而自豪了。</p>
<p>不過話要說回來，戲劇是隨時代轉移的，不進則退，筆者希望該劇塲當局曁各藝員，勿以爲有了地位而自滿，還要不斷的努力，向前邁進，同時更希望編劇諸君，多編有益世道人心的名劇，俾孤島的羣衆，在娛樂中無形得到精神上的薰陶，這是筆者所懇切願望的</p>

<p>古寒小姐在紅星亂塲上演「在歡之夜」後，繼續在「人之初」中演出主角簫麗蓮，其說白的流利淸脆，演技的深刻自然，藝術界一致公認她是極有希望的人才，聽說她是研究音樂的，所以她的表演，充滿着美的節奏。</p>
<p>「雷雨」之後，紅星將上演名劇「日出」，因爲她在「人之初」中，獨當一面，帮了紅星不少的忙，所以主幹王逸公君將親自起潘經理一角，表示向古小姐尊崇的意思，因爲「日出」的排演，由古小姐起主角交際花陳白露，觀於「人之初」的蕭麗蓮，她自然是很相當的，可是團中又有人硬要她起小東西一角，現在古小姐已答允試一下。在古小姐起主角陳白露的當兒，王逸公君起潘經理；陳白露由白燕演出時，古小姐起小東西一角。</p>
<p>不必說話劇，電影的「日出，」觀衆當也不少。陸露明的陳白露，袁美雲的小東西，這兩個是多麼個性小同的角色，古寒將身兼二職，而且一是主角，一是耍角。古小姐對於話劇界的貢獻，將放一燦爛的異彩。</p>

<p>The Japanese are Already in a Situation of Inevitable Defeat</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee convened. President Chiang delivered an opening address with the main title: Opening Address of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee, and the subtitle: Using Facts to Prove the Enemy Country is Bound to Fail and Our Country is Bound to Win. The content outline is: (1) The tasks of this Plenary Session and the spirit of perseverance and thoroughness that our war of resistance and revolution should have; (2) Our most important task at present is to understand the purpose of the war of resistance and the situation of the enemy and ourselves, and to firmly establish resolve and confidence; (3) The enemy country has reasons for inevitable defeat, including the following examples: 1. Violating its established steps of its continental policy; 2. Its attempts of "subjugating without fighting," "quick war and quick victory," and "quick peace and quick conclusion" all fail to succeed; 3. Strategic failures are due to (1) ignorance of oneself and the enemy, (2) solely seeking cunning and luck, violating the principle of "clumsy speed," (3) prolonged stationing of troops, falling into a predicament; (4) Political failures, including: 1. creating puppets, using traitors, deepening the corruption of soldiers; 2. diplomatic policies are fragmented and contradictory, becoming increasingly isolated and dangerous; (5) not understanding Chinese history and national strength, and not understanding the present era and the characteristics of the development of the Chinese revolution; (4) The enemy's inevitable defeat is our inevitable victory... We should strengthen our spiritual power, persevere in the war of resistance, fully fight to the end, and never compromise or surrender midway; (5) From our own country's self-examination, in terms of history, geography, culture, national spirit, and economy, there is a foundation that makes the enemy inevitably unable to win; (6) The direction of the development of the international situation must tend towards safeguarding good faith and peace, and the democratic countries are also strengthening their preparations and determination to curb aggression. We should follow this path of public reason and justice to implement the national policy of resisting to the end; (7) China's war of resistance is a war of sorrow and a war of righteousness, seeking to contribute to East Asia and the world. Since ancient times, a sorrowful army has always won, and a righteous war has always succeeded; (8) Understanding oneself, understanding the enemy, understanding the environment, and the inevitability of the development of things, one can clearly understand the numbers of success or failure, victory or defeat; (9) In the future, we must start from scratch without any reliance, and work hard against the enemy's situation; (1) use our unity to deal with the enemy's arrogance and disorder, achieving superiority from below; (2) give play to the characteristics of our agricultural country, persisting in frugality, deepening the weaknesses of the enemy's industrial country; (3) make use of our country's advantages in timing and location, step up all wartime construction, and promote a crisis of social collapse in the enemy country; (4) truly practice the Three People's Principles and overthrow the enemy's militarism; (10) We must clearly recognize the revolutionary responsibility of the Party and ourselves, establish an oath to be responsible, fulfill our duties, and strive to the end, working together quickly, hard, diligently, and practically to win the victory of the war of resistance and complete the great cause of the revolution. The full text of the opening address is as follows:</p>
<p>Comrades, this plenary session is held at the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, which is of great significance and the task is particularly arduous. I have repeatedly pointed out recently that our War of Resistance should be divided into two major stages. The first phase was before the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan; the second phase is after the retreat from Wuhan. The task of the first phase was to consume the enemy's strength as much as possible, to cover our rear preparations, to establish the foundation for a protracted war, and to complete all strategic and political arrangements for our second phase of the War of Resistance. The task of the second phase is to take over the achievements of the previous struggle, implement all the plans arranged in the first phase, and give play to the power of our War of Resistance to achieve the goal of victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction. Therefore, this plenary session is a major key for us to turn defense into offense, turn recovery into victory, and determine prosperity or decline, survival or death with our efforts. Facing this major key of survival or death, prosperity or decline, the comrades present should review the facts of the past, determine the plans for the future, and increase the courage to fight, with the spirit of starting from scratch, to carry through to the end in a down-to-earth manner. Recently, the situation of the War of Resistance, on the one hand, our military and popular morale are stronger than before, and the internal and external situation is also becoming more and more favorable. The people of the whole country believe that the danger to our country has passed, and they are very optimistic about the future of the country, and the psychology of inevitable victory is even stronger. However, the mission of our Party is becoming increasingly arduous. Therefore, all comrades must be more concerned about the future of the Party and the country, and study whether there are better strategies and plans. In my opinion, the spirit of our revolutionary party is only a question of whether we ourselves do it or not, that is, whether we ourselves are revolutionary or not. In other words, it is whether we resist the war or not. If we can do it and can resist to the end, then we are not afraid of not having a plan, and we are not afraid of not having a way. We must know that the real way of our revolution is (to use clumsiness to overcome skill) and (to use the few to overcome the many), and to move forward based on our Three People's Principles. If we can sacrifice and fight with the same spirit as in the first phase of the War of Resistance, and can go further and do it in a pragmatic way, then victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction will be without doubt. If not, either knowing but not acting, or acting but not exerting effort, or making temporary efforts but not being able to persist, or starting positively but becoming negative halfway, or only talking about form and not seeking reality, or having only aspirations but no concrete plans for implementation, or having plans but not being able to execute them bravely, then the favorable opportunities will be easily missed, and the improved situation will not help the facts. Therefore, the root of all success or failure, prosperity or decline lies in whether we have a revolutionary spirit and whether we have the confidence and determination to achieve our goals. Only with this determination can we formulate effective plans based on our determination. Only with firm confidence in revolution, national salvation, and the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance can we not be afraid of difficulties or dangers and earnestly implement the established plans to achieve success. Therefore, I ask our comrades, the first thing is to establish determination and confidence. Where do determination and confidence come from? It is to have a correct understanding of our goals of the War of Resistance and the situation of the War of Resistance. Only with a correct understanding will the determination not be defeated, and the courage of blood and energy can persist and fight to the end without slackening. Only with a correct understanding will our confidence be a confidence based on solid grounds, and we can be steadfast and unyielding. Why do we want to resist the war? It is because we demand the survival and freedom of the nation and the nation, and we want to follow the Three People's Principles to carry out revolution and save the country. But the enemy fundamentally does not allow us to survive, let alone allow us to be free. If we cannot resist the war at this time and fantasize about compromise midway, it will be abandoning halfway. In this way, our nation will be completely destroyed, and our descendants will forever be slaves and beasts, and will never recover. If we cannot resist to the end, our country will be reduced to a subordinate country and colony of the enemy country, and from then on, international justice will be fundamentally overturned, and world peace will never be guaranteed. The ambition of our Prime Minister's lifelong advocacy of revolution, national salvation, and saving the world will all be in vain. Since the enemy government and its Prime Minister Konoe successively issued statements, his conspiracy to annex China to dominate the Pacific and invade the whole world has been known to the world and need not be said again. What I want to make clear to all comrades now is that the enemy country has already failed, and there are various reasons to prove that it will eventually suffer the greatest failure. As long as we fight on, we are sure to have victory. First, in terms of the enemy, not to mention that in the past eighteen months, he has killed or wounded more than 700,000 officers and soldiers on the north and south battlefields of China, and consumed 900 million war expenses, so that his country is exhausted, agriculture and industry are stagnant, society is decadent, and political unrest is brewing. These are all tangible signs. From the time he launched the invasion to the present, all strategic and political operations, as well as his observations and predictions of China and his understanding of the times, have violated principles and fallen into mistakes everywhere. At this time of success or failure, profit or loss, survival or destruction, I want to list the examples of the enemy's inevitable failure for the plenary session based on true facts, and submit a detailed analysis report to all comrades. First, everyone knows that the enemy's determination to launch the invasion is to implement his continental policy. The so-called continental policy, according to their internal secret traditional policy and their public Tanaka Memorial, is to first occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, and then try to invade the entire territory of China, and even dominate Asia and unify the world. But when he had not yet stabilized the occupation of the Northeast, he wanted to invade North China. After his power reached North China, he changed from chronic erosion to acute annexation. Therefore, he openly occupied our Tianjin and this has completely deviated from his so-called established national policy and strategy of the continental policy. Not only that, he also wanted to advance to Central China, and even invade South China and occupy our Guangzhou. This is his further step to destroy their traditional policy. After he entered Central China and South China, not only did he fall into a situation where he could not advance or retreat strategically, but also politically, he was forced to go against the trend and make enemies with the world's powers, falling into a situation of being besieged on all sides. This is his first way of inevitable defeat. Second, his initial attempt on China was to subdue us without fighting, but we finally fought without surrendering, which was beyond his expectations. After the war, he wanted a quick war and quick victory, but from Nankou, Songhu, Xinkou, Nanjing, all the way to the Battle of Southern Shandong and the battles on the edge of Poyang Lake and the Dabie Mountains, he went deeper step by step, and finally could not achieve a quick war and quick victory. Therefore, he turned around and longed for a quick peace and a quick conclusion. Before we withdrew from Wuhan, his magazines and newspapers tried their best to advocate stopping the war or finding a way to stop the war, and on the one hand, he used various cunning schemes to try to lure us into the trap, deceive the world, and seek cheap advantages. But soon he showed his true colors and took out his so-called "Asia Prosperity Agency" and "East Asia Cooperation System" two very poisonous plans. Now, not only the people of the whole country have seen through his conspiracy, but the world has also seen his ambition. This plan of his has clearly failed again. This is his second strategic failure. Third, from a strategic point of view, he not only violated three military principles, but also committed three major taboos in military affairs: ignorance of oneself and ignorance of the enemy. He never dreamed that our country would resist for as long as eighteen months. Not only would it not be subdued, but it would become stronger and stronger. He also did not know that his own military strength, after being used to a certain extent, would be exhausted to the point where he would use five people to fight one of us. "In the Second War Zone, there is a statistic that for every one of our deaths, the enemy army will die 14 and a half people." He tried to seek cunning and luck, vainly trying to win with skill, but the result was the opposite, completely violating Sun Tzu's principle of "soldiers value clumsy speed," leading to repeated political tides and a growing anti-war atmosphere. Konoe Fumimaro, whom they boasted as the only wartime cabinet, had to step down because of this, which also confirmed Sun Tzu's famous saying that "a long war is not beneficial to the country." The ancient people said that the great taboo of "stopping troops from going deep" was originally said to the strong. Now he has gone from the edge of the East China Sea to thousands of miles away in the interior of our country, making the areas he has occupied become the sphere of influence where our regular army and guerrillas are active, subject to our control everywhere, and constantly attacked by us. If you want to advance, you will get deeper and deeper, and if you want to retreat, there are thorns everywhere. This is truly doing what Sun Tzu said, "blunt the army, frustrate their sharpness, weaken their strength, and exhaust their wealth," and has stepped into the crisis of "the princes taking advantage of their disadvantages." In short, in the current situation, the enemy has indeed fallen into the situation of "hanging shape" as Sun Tzu called it. It is really the so-called that it is neither on the top nor on the bottom. It has reached the point where "it is difficult to return without winning and unfavorable." This is his most obvious strategic failure. Fourth, in terms of political strategy, he can only win over some incomplete and infamous traitors to be puppets, and use hooligans and bandits as pawns. On the one hand, he deepens the corruption of his soldiers, and on the other hand, he exposes his various sins and stupidity for the ridicule of the world. Moreover, he is arrogant and wants to use his culture, which he pieced together and imitated, to annex our long-standing independent culture, and use military and political aggression to plunder our economy. As a result, not only did he get nowhere, but he deepened the phenomenon of superiority from below in his country. As for diplomacy, he originally attempted to ease relations with Soviet Russia, but the result was only self-deprecating. He vainly tried to court the United States, but it aroused its aversion. He intended to break up the front line of Britain, France, and the United States, but the result was the opposite, step by step, contradictory everywhere. This is the so-called fundamentally wrong, and the branches and leaves are useless. Fifth, when it comes to his understanding of China, he does not recognize the strong potential resistance of our Chinese nation since ancient times, nor does he recognize that the present era is an era in which nationalism is developed and irresistible, nor does he recognize the truth of our Chinese history. He regards himself as Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing, and finally thinks that the Chinese nation is easy to deceive and destroy and there is no problem, but he does not know that the main reason for the defeat of Song and Ming was that in those years, very few people in the court did not understand the enemy's situation, did not distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, and were threatened by the enemy in spirit, and were finally deceived and surrendered by the enemy, which was not the destruction of our entire nation. Now the enemy vainly wants to realize the dream of controlling our country in the short term under the slogan of "establishing a new order in East Asia." He did not think that it took him more than forty years to invade our Northeast, used a lot of troops, and spent a lot of money, and he still cannot control our Northeast, let alone rule it. He still does not realize the lesson of this immediate fact. Instead, he wants to intensify his efforts, annex the whole of China, and follow the same path of recent failure. This is because he fundamentally does not recognize our Chinese nation, does not recognize the power of our Three People's Principles, does not recognize the characteristics of our National Government, and does not recognize today's era, as well as today's revolutionary strategy and revolutionary tactics in China. Frankly speaking,</p>

<h3 id="e2">What is the Basis for Japan's Long-Term War? <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, in response to questions from various members of the House of Representatives regarding his policy toward China, stated that Japan would never change its established policy toward China, and that even if a third party were to impose economic pressure on Japan, Japan had already made arrangements to resist it. The reason why the Japanese House of Representatives raised questions about the policy toward China was to express the Japanese people's concern and disappointment with the war of aggression against China, but Hiranuma's response still showed that the Japanese fascist military阀 was determined to go its own way.</p>
<p>Japan, as a small island country, together with its mainland Korea, Taiwan, and South Sakhalin, has only 670,000 square kilometers of land and more than 97 million people, and its agricultural products and mineral resources are extremely scarce. For her to maintain a ten-year war against China, or even a hundred-year war, or even to fight against a third country at all costs, is really like barking in a dream. In the past 19 months of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has already shown signs of being unable to continue to support its manpower. Recently, the new troops sent to China are mostly young soldiers with poor eyesight, and there are many fascist European comrades mixed in with the various mechanized units. As for the recent news that the Japanese military plans to extend the service life of the Navy and Army in China, and the recent active recruitment of Chinese gangsters and bandits to implement a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, that is even more ironclad proof that Japan's domestic manpower is empty.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, Japan is even weaker. At the beginning of this year, Japanese public opinion had expressed optimistic views on the past Japanese economic situation, and boasted that its economic foundation was strong enough to bear the dual tasks of "fighting" and "construction." This optimistic public opinion cannot deceive the Japanese people, nor can it deceive international people. Just take its most important finance and foreign trade as an example, and you can know that Japan's economy has reached a point of total collapse.</p>
<p>First, in terms of Japan's finances: last year, the general expenditure and the military special expenditure for the war of aggression against China were about 6.03 billion yen, which increased to more than 8.04 billion yen last year. This year, according to reports, the general expenditure is more than 3.69 billion yen, and the military special expenditure is 5.4 billion yen, totaling more than 9 billion yen. With last year's income of 8 billion yen, Japan has already shown a tendency to be unable to bear it. Compared with general income and expenditure, monthly expenditure usually exceeds between 300 million yen and 500 million yen. To fill this deficit, Japan has to do its best to exploit the people through public debt issuance, new tax increases, and currency inflation. However, these three methods have now reached the saturation point. Of the 4.3 billion yen of public debt last year, only 3.6 billion yen were sold; the increase of 230 million yen in new taxes has made people recognize that "one dish and one soup" is a luxury; the year-end issuance of 2.85 billion yen of banknotes is indeed an unprecedented record for the issuance of Japanese banknotes, but in fact, there are still a large number of military tickets and counterfeit money issued in China that have not been included in the calculation. Then this year's expenditure of 9 billion yen, in this time of poverty and exhaustion, I am afraid that there is no other way to go except to go bankrupt!</p>
<p>Then look at Japan's foreign trade; Japan's foreign trade is the lifeline of Japan's various industrial sectors. In the first eleven months of last year, exports were 2.39 billion yen, imports were 2.38 billion yen, and imports exceeded exports by more than 10 million yen. Japan believes that this is the best phenomenon in wartime. In fact, Japan's phenomenon of excess imports is caused by its aggressive force. Last year, Japan's trade with the so-called Japanese currency groups in the puppet Manchuria and North China increased by 40% in exports and 18% in imports compared with the previous year; however, exports and imports to Europe, the United States and other countries have decreased, and imports still continue to exceed exports, and the degree of deterioration is even more serious than before. Therefore, the Japanese government feels that the power of trade control is not enough, and also wants to promote various policies to revitalize export trade. At present, Japan's foreign trade, both exports and imports, is completely aimed at military needs under government control. Therefore, a large amount of gold is constantly flowing out, and the general non-military industries in the country are generally declining. Although the increase in other commodity prices and the unemployment of labor cannot fully reveal the truth under the supervision of the economic police, judging from the revealed phenomena, it is already on the road to deterioration.</p>
<p>Regardless of human or material resources, Japan has no possibility of long-term operations. What Japan is now hoping for is, on the one hand, to obtain raw materials and food for long-term operations from China, such as oil, coal, and iron in the Northeast, cotton and wool in North China, and rice in the Yangtze River Basin, which are currently being plundered as much as possible; on the other hand, it hopes to continue to sell Japan's main products to the United Kingdom, the United States and their colonies, and thus obtain supplies of raw materials and military supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, as long as China can break Japan's economic control in the guerrilla areas, and the United Kingdom and the United States can implement economic retaliation against Japan, it will be seen that the dream that Japan boasts of being able to cope with a long-term war will vanish with the collapse of national strength.</p>
<p>In the past, Napoleon invaded Imperial Russia. At that time, the strategy and tactics of all-out attack and long-term resistance had not yet been invented. Napoleon, with such talent and such a large army, could not avoid defeat. What's more, today, we are a republic of the nation, the spirit is generally developed, and the people of the whole country are fighting against the enemy with the same hatred. Under the command of the National Government, we are implementing the strategy and tactics of modern revolution. No force can hope to succeed by luck. Sun Tzu's chapter on terrain has three major principles: "Knowing that the enemy cannot be attacked, knowing that our soldiers cannot be attacked, and knowing that the terrain cannot be fought." Now I will add another principle for Sun Tzu: "Knowing that the enemy can be attacked, knowing that our soldiers can be attacked, knowing that the terrain can be attacked, but not knowing that the times cannot be attacked, then there is no way to win." The enemy does not know the situation of the other party, let him not recognize the times, it is unnecessary to say more and it can be understood. Just the five points mentioned above can be determined that the enemy has a reason for inevitable defeat. Now the enemy and we are in a stalemate, and the situation of victory or defeat is different. The enemy's inevitable defeat proves that I have a way to win. Just from a military point of view, when the first phase of the war was fought, it was fought in areas with convenient transportation, and his army, navy, and air force and mechanized units could enter, use, and move freely. In such a battlefield, fighting for as long as eighteen months, not only did he fail to defeat us, but we became more and more refined and stronger and stronger. From then on, in the second phase of the war, we entered a battlefield with complex terrain, staggered mountains, boundless deserts, and extremely inconvenient transportation and supplies. His tricks are naturally more difficult to use. What's more, he has used more than 85% of the country's military strength. Everyone knows that the enemy country's military equipment was originally prepared with 30% for China, while the other 70% was all for Russia. Today, in our China, not only has the military strength used exceeded his expectations by more than double, but the number of people killed or wounded in China has reached more than 35% of his total military strength. As for the detailed figures of the enemy army, I will explain them in detail to all comrades when the military report is made. Everyone sees that the enemy army's military strength, use, and deaths and injuries have reached such a degree. This proves that his failure in the invasion has been determined. Moreover, comparing the difficulty between us and the enemy in the future battlefield, one bullet of ours can be used as at least three bullets, and one soldier of ours can at least be equivalent to the strength of three enemy soldiers. And the enemy is the opposite. According to the facts and experience of our past year and a half, the enemy must use at least three people as one of our soldiers, and use three bullets as one bullet of our army, and perhaps add several times more, it is also unknown. Therefore, the problem today is that as long as our country does not give the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of, the final victory is guaranteed. What is giving the enemy an opportunity? If our spirit is threatened by it, our will is shaken, we willingly surrender, and we are eager to compromise, that is what the enemy wants. Only in this way can the enemy extricate himself from his hopeless situation and remedy his irreparable weakness, and our country and nation will be forever sunk and will never recover. In short, if we can persist in the war of resistance, we will surely win. If we cannot resolutely resist and compromise with the enemy and sign any peace agreement, then the enemy can enter endlessly according to the position he enjoys on the surrender terms. At this point, our China will be covered in the fog of the new vocabulary of the "New Order in East Asia," "Japan, Manchuria and China are inseparable," and the "East Asia Cooperation System" claimed by the enemy country. Under the cloud, he stopped breathing, covered his ears and eyes, suffered all kinds of hardships, and suffered all kinds of sacrifices. The entire China, no matter where, no matter who, will be slaughtered and ravaged by the enemy, and there is no way to escape. Once the spirit is threatened, the situation will change immediately, and once the humiliating terms are signed, the master-slave status will be established. This is tantamount to sacrificing the future lives of our Chinese descendants and saving the enemy country from danger. (To be continued tomorrow) (Electric message dated 25th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to President Kong's statement today, the National Government has reached an agreement with the British Imperial Airways for direct air transport of passengers and mail between China and Europe, with emphasis on the UK. This method is established on a mutual basis. It is heard that the Chinese and British governments signed an agreement at 5:00 PM yesterday in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and exchanged documents. The representative of the British government was Grenville, who is stationed here to manage British foreign affairs. It is heard that the Chinese and British authorities have agreed not to publish the full text of the agreement for the time being. The start of the new business will be the first time foreign aircraft have flown within Chinese territory with the permission of the National Government. Imperial Airways aircraft have been authorized to fly from Burma and Hong Kong to Yunnan, while China National Aviation Corporation aircraft will fly from Yunnan to Burma and Hong Kong. It is heard that negotiations on direct air transport of passengers and mail between China and the Soviet Union are also nearing completion. According to the agreement currently concluded, China National Aviation Corporation, jointly formed by China and the United States, will begin operating air services between China, Burma, and Hong Kong. According to President Kong's statement to Reuters reporters, this new undertaking between China and the UK is of great importance. In addition to the new sky link promoting trade interests between China and the UK, it will also make the Chinese and British people closer to each other, and the result will be a better understanding, which is the key to peace and prosperity between countries. This new move is very meaningful. Hundreds of years ago, camels carried silk, tea, and other goods produced in China across the desert to Europe, which took months or even years to reach, and the journey was full of dangers and may not have been certain to reach. Later, it was replaced by sailing ships and steamships, but modern airplanes have added a new page to the history of transportation between China and Europe. President Kong also said that a new highway has been connected between Yunnan and Burma, and now airplanes will connect them, and he hopes that railways will connect them soon. Imperial Airways has worked hard to plan to operate services from its base in India to Yunnan and Hong Kong, and now it has become a reality. The National Government has approved the signing of the agreement. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The aviation industry has expressed great interest in the news from Chongqing that air transport between China and Europe via Yunnan has been arranged. It is said that Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University, who arrived in the UK last week, flew from Chongqing to the UK via Kunming and Hanoi, which took a total of nine days. If he had taken the route via Rangoon and flown directly from Chongqing, the time could have been reduced to five days. People here also regard this news as important because it shows the determination of the Chinese government to develop western China. As far as London knows, the news from Chongqing is a bit premature, but a formal announcement will be made in the near future. The aviation industry believes that this method mostly contains mutual concessions, that is, British aircraft can freely fly in Chinese airspace. Foreign airlines have never been allowed to enjoy this freedom. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The joint meeting of the "Provisional" and "Upkeep" governments held here has come to an end. As far as the published resolutions are concerned, there are no surprising resolutions. What was resolved was to set up offices in Japan and "Manchukuo," send representatives to Tokyo and Changchun, and resolve to study the status of currency in order to establish a fixed currency system in North China, which means they intend to establish "Joint Reserve" paper money as the only currency circulating in the Beijing-Shanghai area and North China. The meeting also issued a statement endorsing the peace terms proposed by Konoe on December 22 last year, saying that they fully agree with these terms. If there were any resolutions on tax rates or the new "Central Government" at the meeting, they must still be kept strictly secret. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Bishop Yu Bin Passes Through Europe to America; Church Relieves Refugees; Government Sends Letter of Thanks to the Pope <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Diocese in China, in the capacity of Commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, representative of Shanghai charitable organizations, and Chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, was ordered to go to the Americas. He passed through Rome and paid respects to Pope Pius XI. He recently arrived in Paris and immediately gave a speech to the press, briefly saying that the time for the Catholic Church to develop in China has come. China is determined to fight to the end for independence and territorial integrity. When I recently paid respects to the Pope in Rome, I presented a letter from my country's government regarding the sincere efforts of Catholic priests to relieve the innocent women and children in China who have been poisoned by new-style weapons, expressing gratitude. This is a matter of great concern to the Catholic Church, and the Chinese government's direct expression of gratitude to the Pope is a good start. The Pope was very moved after reading it and immediately gave special blessings to me and the people in the Americas who have contributed to the relief effort, and bestowed commemorative medals, which was truly inspiring. Bishop Yu Bin also described the suffering experienced by China and the bombing of undefended cities by aircraft, saying that millions of Chinese people have died and no fewer than 30 million people are homeless. When Bishop Yu Bin was asked about the hope for peace, he replied, "The word peace is proposed by the aggressor, intending to use peace as an excuse to control China. In this regard, China will never accept anything other than a fair and lasting peace. As for Wang Jingwei, he only wants to discuss the terms proposed by Japan, not to accept them directly, as has been rumored outside." Finally, he said that the Catholic Church has a major mission in China, "There is sincere trust between the Chinese government and the church, because the Catholic Church in China is the church of China, and in France, it is the church of France. In short, it serves the country in which it is located and has no foreign color. The benefits that the Chinese people have received from the Catholic Church today are unprecedented. If he is determined to lead the Red Cross Society at the front at the age of sixty-two, it is the Belgian missionary who has become a Chinese citizen (i.e., Father Vincent Lebbe). He is the military chaplain of the Red Cross rescue team, the Benedictine priest of Belgian nationality. He is the most admirable French Jesuit priest, Father Jacquinot de Bésange, who organizes the refugee camps. The Catholic Church is always suitable, and the future is very optimistic."

<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources, the "Third Joint Committee" held in Nanjing by the "Renovation" and Beiping "Provisional" governments has closed yesterday. It is heard that almost all of the "resolutions" of this "joint meeting" were instructed by the Japanese side and formally passed by the two puppet organizations. In its resolutions, attention will be paid to the takeover of postal agencies, all postage will be increased, and stamps will also be reprinted. In addition to postal issues, "discussions" were also held on the issues of cotton and coal in North China, and it is heard that the production and distribution of Chinese cotton and coal will be based on Japan's needs to comply with the principle of economic cooperation between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. In addition, the puppet organizations are also planning to control the export of rice from central China. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of independence for the Philippine Islands, the United States government promulgated a law in 1934 stipulating that the islands should be fully independent in 1946. The Philippine authorities then requested earlier political independence. The US Senate and House of Representatives formed a joint committee in April of last year to discuss the issue. Its report was recently submitted to Congress for review by President Roosevelt. Its content advocates that the political independence period for the Philippine Islands should remain at 1946, but the economic independence period should be postponed to 1960. In other words, the preferential treatment enjoyed by the islands for trade with the United States should be gradually phased out from 1946 until 1960, when their goods exported to the United States will be subject to import duties, no different from imported goods from other countries. President Roosevelt also said that he and Philippine President Quezon both expressed approval of the above report. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance is currently studying tax increase proposals, planning to levy new taxes on fresh fruits, bridal attire, wool clothing, tea, coffee, potted flowers, and other items. The purpose is to raise 200 million Japanese yen. The rice wine tax, currently less than 1.5 sen per gallon, will be doubled. The tax rates on various alcoholic beverages, including beer, will also be increased, all to be implemented this year. There are currently 47 types of commodity taxes, and 23 more will be added this year. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance has scheduled a meeting of the Tariff Investigation Committee on the 28th to deliberate on the supplementary budget for special accounts for temporary military expenditures. No later than mid-February, it will submit to the parliament the amendment to the "China Incident" Special Tax Law and the amendment to the Temporary Profits Tax Law. The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting at 6 PM on the 23rd to review the draft proposal prepared by the Taxation Bureau. As a result, concrete measures have been decided on regarding the increase in profits tax and the newly established construction tax, which together account for a total of 180 million yen in the outline of the tax increase proposal.

<p>(Tokyo) In the House of Representatives questioning session, in addition to the two dispatches from yesterday and the day before, there are other important points. For example, Mr. Kawasaki, a leader of the Minseito Party, questioned whether the government had considered countermeasures against the Chinese people, who have a unique national character and a unique history and culture. Hiranuma replied, without deviating from his traditional views, thus revealing his lack of understanding of China. Kawasaki further asked what the "specific areas in China" mentioned in Konoe's statement on December 22nd, where Japanese troops must be stationed, referred to. Hiranuma replied that the so-called specific areas would change according to the evolution of the situation, but Mengjiang was the primary area, avoiding answering the key point. Mr. Tobu, a leader of the Seiyukai Party, questioned the routes for foreign arms shipments to China. Itagaki and Arita successively made strong statements. Tobu also asked whether there was an intention to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Hiranuma replied that the spirit of anti-communism must be strengthened, but the specific plan could not be publicly stated. Arita replied that methods to strengthen the spirit of anti-communism were being studied. Mr. Aburadani, a leader of the Toho Party, questioned the policies toward China and third countries. Hiranuma's reply was still full of threatening tones, which everyone knew was outwardly strong but inwardly weak. On the 24th, both the upper and lower houses of the Diet held budget general meetings, and the questioning battle gradually entered into concrete issues. Kawasaki of the Minseito Party first questioned the cabinet on what preparations it had for controlling currency. If the quantity of currency increases while material remains scarce, it will be of no use. This question is most worthy of attention, and from this, one can imagine that the Japanese side cannot avoid the dual suffering of currency inflation and material scarcity. Minister of Commerce and Industry Hatta only replied that the government is asking experts to plan meticulously. Kawasaki finally asked how the cabinet plans to promote gold production. Ishiwatari replied that the gold production volume last year was lower than expected, which was the result of heavier taxation, and efforts are now being made to promote it. From this reply, it can be seen that Japan's gold production plan has also encountered setbacks. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Imperial Household, in order to save kerosene, has completely stopped using automobiles. The vehicle recently dispatched to Tokyo Station to greet Commander of Central China Forces Shunroku Hata was also a horse-drawn carriage. At the same time, the supply of oil for civilian automobiles will soon be completely stopped. Public buses in Tokyo have been advised to install charcoal equipment in preparation for switching to charcoal. The current monthly consumption of kerosene in Japan has decreased by 35% compared to before the war. In January, the amount of oil used by private automobiles was only 15% of the usual amount.

<p>(Tokyo) The major domestic reform proposals that former Home Minister Suetsugu had strenuously advocated have almost all been shelved by his successor, Marquis Kido. These include the revision of the election law, the Tokyo urban plan, national reorganization, the amendment of existing press laws, and the establishment of a law for journalists. The last two items mentioned above were previously unheard of and were only revealed to the outside world when their shelving was announced. Although their content has not been made public, it is conceivable that there would have been severe restrictions on the activities of Japanese newspapers and journalists. Thus, all of the proposals that Suetsugu had put forward, which led to the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet, have now been abandoned by his successor. According to Kido's intention, at a time when the whole country urgently needs unity, submitting such proposals in the current Diet session would only cause strong opposition and create unnecessary internal friction.

<h3 id="e28">British Government Promotes National Service; Everyone Does Their Best to Defend the Country <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(London) The government has begun distributing 20 million copies of "National Service Handbook" everywhere today to carry out a grand national voluntary service plan. The book first contains an exhortation written by Prime Minister Chamberlain, which reads, "We all wish to live in peace with our neighbors, but to maintain peace, we must have strong internal strength. The country now needs your service, and you are also eager to fulfill your responsibilities. This booklet will indicate the path. I urge you to read it carefully and decide on the 'type' that best suits you." Lord Privy Seal and Minister of Civil Defence Sir Anderson also wrote a preface, saying, "This call is for peace, not for war. We have no intention of aggression. Our only wish is to live in peace with all nations. But to realize this wish, we must rise up and do it. We must make ourselves strong, and then the forces for peace can be real. We must make ourselves safe, and then others will not dare to think of aggressing against us." This booklet details the various ways that millions of men and women in various parts of Britain can serve the country. The purpose of this plan is twofold: (1) to fill the existing gaps in military and civil defense, and (2) to protect important industries and affairs in wartime. The first purpose can be achieved by distributing the "National Service Handbook," because the book lists various services and includes detailed tables and indexes. The second purpose is the main reason for printing this booklet, because it is intended to avoid recruiting people who must remain in their peacetime occupations during wartime. There are two types of application forms in the book: one for those who are willing to help, stating their name, age, address, the service they wish to join, and their current occupation; the other for stating the name, address, and business of their employer. The Ministry of Labour can use this information to decide what kind of service to recruit applicants for, or whether their service cannot be used. The list of reserved occupations involves 6-7 million men, more than 3 million of whom are over 45 years old, and one in five are between 18 and 25 years old. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Washington: After the merger of Germany and Austria, all principal and interest on Austrian debt to the United States have been suspended. The United States government has sent a note to Germany, demanding that it be responsible for repayment, but Germany refuses to acknowledge this. The State Department has published the notes exchanged by both sides, the outline of which is as follows. The first note submitted by the United States government was issued on November 25th of last year, and its content was to require Germany to confirm the debts formerly owed by Austria. The German Foreign Office immediately replied, stating in essence that although the country had reached agreements with certain governments to resolve the issue of Austria's foreign debt, Germany was "not obliged to be responsible" for this debt. Germany and the United States might as well try to negotiate, but Germany's trade deficit with the United States meant that it would be difficult to reach the same agreement between Germany and the United States as the agreement between Germany and certain countries regarding the Austrian debt issue. After receiving this reply, the United States government instructed the Chargé d'Affaires in Germany on January 20th of this year to make representations to the German Foreign Office, refuting it and informing it that the United States government could not accept the German government's legal interpretation of this issue. As for the German government's view that the amount of debt that a debtor country can afford to repay should depend on the amount of its trade surplus with the creditor country, that is, if the country has a trade deficit with the creditor country, it cannot assume responsibility for repayment of debt, this view is also not something that the United States can condone. However, the United States government is still prepared to consider any suggestions that the German government can make. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Lleida: It is widely believed that the fall of Barcelona is imminent. Nationalist troops, who have been moving overnight, have approached the city from all directions. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Lleida: The Nationalist Army Headquarters announced that the last line of defense of Barcelona has been broken, and thousands of government troops have surrendered. Last night, under artillery fire, government troops successively retreated into the city. Nationalist troops are approaching the western and southern suburbs of Barcelona in two routes, while the third route is conducting a large encirclement 20 miles north of the city. Yesterday's battle of Olesa was the most intense in the entire war situation. The defenders were ordered to fight to the death. The Nationalist artillery fired 80 shells every minute. Now that Manresa has fallen, the fate of Barcelona is decided. According to reliable sources, President Azaña has arrived in Madrid. If the government follows him, the battle of Barcelona can be concluded within two days. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Lleida: Manresa and Martorell are now completely occupied by the Nationalist Army. Manresa is located on the railway from Barcelona to the French border, so the loss of this town means that the government troops' valuable lifeline has been cut off. The Nationalist troops are now based on a line along the Llobregat River from each bank to a point 35 miles inland. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Lleida: Moroccan troops in the Nationalist Army crossed the Barcelona airfield yesterday and reached the coast road, one mile from the outskirts of Barcelona. The Nationalist artillery is now shelling the city, and 2,000 government troops were captured yesterday afternoon. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: A message that ten Moroccan battalions belonging to the Nationalist Army arrived at 7:00 PM today in the southern suburbs of Barcelona, 1.5 kilometers away, has now been confirmed. The Nationalist Army Commander has decided not to attack Barcelona for the time being, but only to encircle it. Once the city's communication with the rear is cut off, it will inevitably surrender on its own within two or three days. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Lleida: The Nationalist Army on the Catalan autonomous region front launched an offensive against Barcelona on several routes. The first route, Moroccan indigenous troops, led by General Yagüe, advanced to 1.5 kilometers south of Barcelona at 7:00 PM today and immediately opened fire with artillery, occupying the airfield on the outskirts. The second route occupied the nearby heights and then took advantage of the victory to attack Barcelona. The third route crossed the Llobregat River (southwest of Barcelona) and reached within the firing line of the Barcelona garrison. The fourth route occupied the city of Manresa (north of Barcelona) at 6:30 PM this afternoon and took advantage of the victory to encircle the government troops' rear, with the aim of achieving a pincer attack. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: Although Barcelona is currently under siege by six divisions of the Nationalist Army, there is still no sign of surrender. Thousands of civilians are taking buses to the countryside. Members of the unions are cleaning the streets in preparation for street fighting. General Sarabia has been appointed as the city defense commander. A large number of trucks are still constantly transporting military supplies and food to the front lines. Anyone who is afraid of war will be sentenced to death. The shipyards and docks in the city have been on fire as a result of bombing by Nationalist aircraft. The central area of the city is not yet within the range of the Nationalist artillery fire.

<p>(Washington) Government officials are deeply disturbed by the situation in Catalonia. President Roosevelt stated yesterday afternoon that the government's legal counsel is currently engaged in research to determine whether the United States has the legal right to lift the arms embargo on Spain. Mass rallies were held last night in New York and Washington, urging the President to repeal the arms embargo. It is expected that Congress will announce a temporary suspension of the Neutrality Act within two months. Conservative and liberal newspapers have expressed concern about the situation after the Nationalist Army's victory in Spain. For example, the Washington Post wrote that the US arms embargo is tantamount to assisting Germany and Italy, and the United States may therefore pay a terrible price. Fascist Spain will be an ideal place to conduct anti-American propaganda throughout Latin America. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>New York: 5,000 citizens marched in procession yesterday afternoon, demanding that the ban on the shipment of American arms to the Spanish Republic be lifted. The demonstrators also prepared a petition, inviting passers-by on the main streets to sign it and submit it to the government authorities to fulfill this demand. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) Regarding the issue of whether the ban on the shipment of American arms to the Spanish Republic should be lifted, after former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, many Christian bishops and Jewish rabbis from 35 states in the United States have jointly written to President Roosevelt to express their support, stating briefly that "This ban should be lifted immediately. If there is hesitation, not only will the Spanish Republic and other democratic countries be harmed, but also the interests on which our lives depend and world peace will be affected." In addition, the editorial staff of the liberal magazine "The New Republic" also telegraphed President Roosevelt, making the same request, stating briefly that the majority of the American people, including Catholics, sympathize with the Spanish Republican government. At this time, the democratic forces of the country are still unyielding and determined to fight to the end. It is not too late for us to provide assistance now. "Even if the collapse of the democratic forces is imminent, we should still do our best until the very end. If Your Excellency can take immediate action, not only will the situation in France and Britain be changed as a result, but the situation in the Spanish war can also be changed." (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Stockholm: Twelve members of the Swedish Parliament have proposed that the 1939 Nobel Peace Prize be awarded to British Prime Minister Chamberlain. This proposal has been submitted to the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee. Their view is that in September 1938, the general situation in Europe was in grave danger, but it was thanks to the efforts of Prime Minister Chamberlain that the catastrophe was averted, and his contribution cannot be denied. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London: Former Foreign Office official Viscount Cranborne said in a speech in Weymouth that Britain's current weakness is only making war closer. He has not seen any signs of Germany and Italy responding to Chamberlain's peace policy. He is not as optimistic as Chamberlain. He believes that Britain is currently in a year of great anxiety or crisis. Dictators such as Germany and Italy have conducted red-blooded experiments and have achieved some success by using force. Why is Britain abandoning policies that seem to have been effective? If Britain wants to maintain its freedom and European civilization, it should make itself an impenetrable fortress at any cost.

<p>(London) It is reported that 30,000 Italian army personnel are concentrated in Genoa and La Spezia. If French forces cross the border, they will immediately enter Spain. It is also reported that Italy issued a warning today, stating that if France intervenes due to the victory of the Nationalist Army, Italy will consider the non-intervention agreement a failure and resume free action.

<p>(Rome) An official bulletin recently announced that the government has decided to summon a batch of reserve soldiers born in 1901, totaling 60,000, to enlist for training on the first of next month. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The British North Sea Fleet has recently sailed to the Strait of Gibraltar. According to official announcements, the Navy points out that recently, in the western Mediterranean, near the Strait of Gibraltar, Britain and France have gathered a large number of naval forces there. Given the recent tension between France and Italy and the decisive stage of the Spanish Civil War, it seems to have political significance. (Haitong dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Burgos: General Jordana, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Nationalist Army government, recently formally signed a cultural agreement with German Ambassador General Faupel. The main points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Both parties shall establish specialized institutions in their respective countries to study the culture of the other party. (2) Both governments shall encourage their citizens to study the language of the other party. (3) Exchange university students. (4) Germany may establish schools in the territory of the Spanish Nationalist Army government, adopt German education methods, and the diplomas issued by these schools shall be recognized by the Ministry of Education of the Spanish Nationalist Army government. (5) Both parties agree to prohibit political exiles from the other party from publishing works detrimental to the other party in their respective countries. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain firmly believes that once the Spanish Nationalist Army achieves final victory, Germany and Italy will jointly make colonial demands. Therefore, he intends to propose a four-power conference of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to discuss the Mediterranean and colonial issues. He also intends to propose to Italy that the debt owed by the Spanish Nationalist Army government to Italy could be borne by Britain. This could allow France to make the following concessions to Italy: (1) The legal status of Italian nationals in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. (2) The French Djibouti port in East Africa should be a free port to facilitate Italian commerce. (3) Italians should be appointed as directors of the Suez Canal Company. (4) Italy should participate in the management rights of the railway from the French Djibouti port to Addis Ababa. However, these concessions by Britain and France should be conditional on Italy's commitment to completely withdraw its volunteer soldiers from Spain. Otherwise, France may decide to send troops to the Spanish island of Minorca (in the Balearic Islands) or Spanish Morocco, and the British government may approve of it.

<h3 id="e41">Under Japanese Military Harassment, the Situation in Quanzhou Bay, Southern Fujian, Assumes an Important Mission of International Trade; Many Reefs in the Sea Prevent Japanese Troops from Landing <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The harassment by Japanese warships in the Xiayu Anchorage area of Quanzhou Port in southern Fujian is quite serious. However, the exact situation there is rarely known to the outside world. According to those who have come to Fuzhou from the area, after the fall of Xiamen, the economic focus of southern Fujian shifted to Quanzhou. Xiayu, outside Quanzhou Bay, has become the only seaport in southern Fujian for international trade. Chimneys and masts fill the Xiayu sea. The Anqing ship, sailing on the Fujian-Philippines route, the Jinan ship, Fujian ship on the Quanzhou-Shanghai route, the Zhidu ship, Haitan ship on the Quanzhou-Xianggang route, the Santa Anna ship on the Quanzhou-Wenzhou route, and the Anhui ship on the Fujian-Singapore route (Singapore) are all anchored in this desolate Xiayu. Therefore, Xiayu suddenly assumes an important mission of domestic and international trade. Thus, although Xiamen has changed color, the economic artery of southern Fujian is still beating. Quanzhou is also becoming increasingly prosperous.</p>
<p>Fujian currently has three gateways for international routes: one is Chuanshi in Fuzhou, the second is Hanjiang in Putian, and the third is Xiayu in Quanzhou. In terms of exports, Chuanshi is more important than Hanjiang and Xiayu. In terms of imports, Xiayu is more important than Chuanshi and Hanjiang. After the fall of Xiamen, Quanzhou not only bears the task of supplying daily industrial products to Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Anxi, Yongchun, and Dehua counties, but also must be responsible for the economic needs of the counties under Zhangzhou. Therefore, Quanzhou's position is now several times higher than before the war, but Xiayu's position is several times more important than Quanzhou. The distance between Quanzhou and Xiayu is two hours by sea. The ship sails out of Quanzhou Bay, passes Xiutu, and then turns at an oblique angle to reach Xiayu. The entire port has more than a thousand households, and the houses are arranged facing the sea. In front is a stretch of alluvial beach. Beyond the beach is the Xiayu Sea, the busy economic artery of southern Fujian. The two islands of Dazhui and Xiaozhui at the mouth of the sea serve as natural sentries, guarding the first line of coastal defense. When Xiamen fell last May and southern Fujian was in a critical situation, the Dazhui gateway was closed, leaving only Xiaozhui open for ships to enter and exit. However, Japanese warships cannot pass without a Chinese pilot because there are many reefs buried in the sea. Therefore, although Japanese warships have harassed Xiayu for many days, constantly bombarding with cannons and machine-gun fire, Chinese troops and civilians guarding the trenches calmly resisted and waited for the enemy to tire. In the end, the Japanese troops could not land and had to leave in frustration. Now Quanzhou Bay is calm, and ships from various countries are still entering and leaving the Xiayu Sea as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e42">On the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway, the Japanese Repeatedly Attempt to Break Through but Fail; Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Recruit Bandits to Control Chinese with Chinese, But the Heterogeneous Crowd Collapses Upon Encounter <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Japanese troops entrenched in Xuzhou and Lianyungang have repeatedly tried to break through the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in order to establish direct contact and plunder the Donghai salt marshes. However, they have been severely attacked by Chinese troops in every attempt. The Japanese troops in Lianyungang are still confined to the Wai Yuntai Mountain area and cannot invade westward. The Japanese troops in Xuzhou, after capturing Suixu, have repeatedly tried to attack eastward but have been repelled by Chinese troops and cannot succeed. Recently, the Japanese army in Xuzhou, realizing that its forces are limited and unable to attack eastward, has changed its strategy and sent people to recruit bandits from large and small groups in eastern Xuzhou, forming three armies. The great traitor Jin Xiaohu is the commander of the puppet First Army, Liu Fulong is the commander of the puppet Second Army, and Japanese rōnin Utsumi is the deputy commander. Li Guanying is the commander of the puppet Third Army, and Japanese Yamaguchi is the deputy commander. The Second and Third Armies were reorganized into the Longhai Eastward Advance Army and concentrated for roll call on the first of this month before departing. The central route is the Japanese army's infantry, artillery, and engineers, invading eastward from Bayiji. Liu's bandits gathered in Tushan and attacked eastward to the Xinjil area in Picheng. Encountering attacks from Chinese troops, Liu's bandits could not resist and retreated. They requested reinforcements from the Japanese army, which burned dozens of villages in Xinjicun. As of recently, they have reportedly approached Yaowan Maowo. The Japanese army on the central route has now reached the Yunhe Railway Station, attempting to cover the construction of a bridge and road (Longhai Railway). They have now been blocked head-on by Chinese troops, who will not allow them to continue attacking eastward. Li Guanying's bandit puppet army on the northern route gathered in Jia and Daquan and set off. On the fourth, they attacked eastward to Xiaotashan in Biantang Township and were defeated head-on by local militia. Li's bandits asked the Japanese army for help, and the Japanese army sent more than a hundred mechanized units. On the seventh, they arrived at Biantang and were bravely attacked by the militia. The Japanese army suffered more than a dozen deaths and seven or eight injuries. The Japanese army still could not succeed and continued to mobilize a large number of reinforcements, concentrating four or five steel cannons to bombard Xiaotashan Village, which was finally breached. The Japanese army massacred more than two hundred unarmed farmers who had not escaped, as a reprisal, and used strong artillery fire to cover Li's bandit puppet army, passing through Biantang. The Japanese army also escorted Li's bandits to Tanshang in Picheng with two tanks. On the tenth, they were blocked head-on by Chinese garrison forces on the east bank of the Grand Canal. The two sides are facing each other across the river, and the Japanese puppets have not been able to cross the river. They are still in a stalemate. This time, the Japanese army used bandits to assist in the attack. Each unit was supplied with some military supplies and old arms. However, the bandits are after all a heterogeneous crowd and collapse upon encountering resistance. Therefore, they are vulnerable.</p>
<p>The bandits bought by the Japanese army are vulnerable, but the Japanese army, in order to implement the vicious plan of controlling Chinese with Chinese, especially pressured the puppet maintenance committees in various places to force local farmers to pay land tax, ranging from six jiao, one yuan, to one yuan and two jiao per mu. The funds collected are still used to buy bandits in various places. Liu Qi and other bandits have recently been lured, gathering in large numbers, burning and plundering, and are even more unscrupulous. The people hate them to the bone. The armed people of Xiaotashan Village are very strong. Liu Qi's bandit gang intended to occupy the village, but the people firmly refused to allow them to enter. Liu's bandits launched an attack, and after two days and nights of fierce fighting, many bandits were killed. The bandit gang again asked the Japanese army for help, and the Japanese army sent a unit of troops to assist in the attack. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers were still killed by the people of the village. Later, the Japanese army sent more troops to aid, and the village was breached. The Japanese army and the bandits then carried out a large-scale massacre. It is estimated that more than three hundred people in the village were killed, their corpses scattered all over the ground, a tragic sight.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent situation in Lianyungang, according to military intelligence: (1) Since Daweijian, under the jurisdiction of Guanyun County, was occupied by the Japanese army, more than a hundred Japanese puppet troops have been stationed there, with four heavy machine guns and two light machine guns. They are often attacked by Ding's Chinese troops. As a result, the Japanese army does not dare to cross the Lei Pond. (2) Two small Japanese gunboats, one transport ship, and two small motorboats are anchored in the Laoyao waters under the jurisdiction of Guanyun County, patrolling back and forth on the sea.</p>

<p>Dinghai is on Alert</p>
<p>Dinghai Dispatch: At 7:30 AM on the 21st, three Japanese warships were discovered off Dinghai, sailing to the Luotou waters outside Zhushanmen, more than ten li from the county seat of Dinghai. At that time, the Libao ship of the Zhengde Company, a Ningbo-Dinghai-Qianpu shipping company, was sailing from Dinghai to Ningbo. The Japanese warship questioned it by signal flag. After the Libao ship owner answered, it was released. The Japanese warship also sailed into Zhushanmen Port. The Dinghai defense forces are on strict alert.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Liu's Chinese troops and Jiang Shuwei's troops of the Zhejiang militia, advanced victoriously from the Yuhang Highway on the 20th and recaptured Gongchen Bridge, continuing to advance towards Hangzhou City. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 21st, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers suddenly came from Shanghai, and under the cover of artillery and aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese positions in Gongbu. In order to avoid sacrifices, the Chinese troops temporarily withdrew to X.X. On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese troops took the opportunity to charge into Gongbu again, but soon abandoned it. Therefore, the area has been extremely chaotic in recent days. In addition to building fortifications in the city, the Japanese army has also transferred a large number of reinforcements from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, stationed in Qingbomen, Qiantangmen, Yongjinmen, etc.</p>
<p>Since the 23rd, the Japanese army in Tangqi in the suburbs of Hangzhou has been attacked by Chinese troops from Huzhou in four directions. The Japanese army's defense fortifications have all been destroyed, and one of the Japanese soldiers' houses has been burned down. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still fighting fiercely there, so land and water transportation have been completely cut off.</p>
<p>Near Chang'an, along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, Chinese and Japanese troops encountered each other on the Hai'ning Highway a few days ago. Casualties on both sides were minor.</p>

<h3 id="e45">128 Commemoration: Open Letter to the Citizens from the City Party Headquarters: Hang Flags – Observe Silence – Donate Funds <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The eighth anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War is approaching. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters is issuing a notice to the public to implement three things, as recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of Shanghai, today, one year and six months after the launch of the all-out war of resistance, we commemorate the anniversary of the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War eight years ago and deeply feel infinite sorrow, grief, and excitement. We believe that this great and glorious day of sacred commemoration of resisting enemy invasion can only be expressed through active and concrete actions. Only then can we live up to the soldiers who died in battle for the war of resistance and the compatriots who were killed. Only active and concrete actions can show the enthusiasm of our people for resisting the war, give the enemy a powerful blow, and win the final victory for our country. Now, three things are listed, hoping that all citizens of the city will practice them in person and earnestly do them.</p>
<p>First, all shops, schools, groups, and households in the city should hang flags at half-mast for one day. The national flag is the sole symbol representing the country. Every citizen of a country cannot but express supreme respect and love for the national flag. Our country is in the midst of a war of resistance, and Shanghai has fallen. We should even more fly our dignified and sacred Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth national flag over the entire city behind enemy lines. Not only shops, schools, and groups should universally hang flags, but also general residents should hang flags in every household to express our mourning for the soldiers who died in battle and the compatriots who were killed. At the same time, it also expresses the warm spirit of our people in the occupied areas who love the country and support the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Second, at noon on the January 28th commemorative day, all citizens of the city should stand in place and observe three minutes of silence to mourn the soldiers who died in battle for the war of resistance and the compatriots who were killed. All entertainment venues in the city should be closed to commemorate.</p>
<p>Third, on this day commemorating January 28th, all citizens of the city should make frugal donations, and all shops in the city should hold charity sales for one day. During the war of resistance, contributing financial resources, materials, and manpower to the country is the duty of every descendant of the Yellow Emperor. All citizens of the city should send the proceeds from their past frugality to the various banks in Shanghai and ask them to voluntarily remit them to the government. All shops in the city should also hold charity sales for one day and send all the profits of the day to the banks and present them to the government.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of the city, we should encourage and supervise each other to ensure that all of us, regardless of men, women, old, or young, can practice the above three things in person and do them earnestly. Children of China, arise, work hard, and strive to complete the war of resistance!</p>
<h3 id="e46">Under Certain Conditions, the Customs Resumes Branch Offices; Three Branch Offices in the Near Suburbs are Established; A Large Number of Japanese Customs Officials are Hired <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The matter of the Japanese side coercing the Jianghai Customs to resume branch offices and hire a large number of Japanese senior customs officials has recently been approved by Chief Secretary Robert through Director-General May. It has been decided to resume three offices first. However, the Japanese side has not yet agreed to open the Wusong branch, which is still under negotiation. The following is an investigation by the reporter of Modern News Agency regarding the various situations:</p>
<p>Resumption of Three Branch Offices</p>
<p>In order to resume branch offices in various war zones, the Jianghai Customs authorities were blackmailed by the Japanese side to hire a large number of Japanese customs officials. This matter has been approved by Chief Secretary May. It has been decided to first restore the customs powers of the branch offices in the near suburbs of Shanghai, namely the North Railway Station, Xujiahui, and Caojiadu. The implementation of customs inspection will begin on February 1st. All senior personnel will be Japanese. Several Western customs officials will be sent to assist. The number of Japanese personnel to be hired for these three branch offices is still under discussion. However, our Chinese customs officials have all expressed their refusal to participate. No one is willing to serve in the branch offices under the armed coercion of the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Restoring Wusong Customs</p>
<p>British Tax Commissioner Robert previously pointed out that the failure to restore the Wusong customs rights and the rampant smuggling incidents have had a significant impact on tax revenue. He repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side for the return of the customs so that he could perform his duties, but to no avail. Recently, when mentioning the restoration of branch offices in various places, Tax Commissioner Robert immediately demanded that the Wusong branch be restored first, but was again rejected by the Japanese side, who believe that the area is still a military fortress and cannot be opened. Negotiations are being carried out repeatedly, but the outcome is still unknown. After the restoration of the three branch offices such as the North Railway Station, it is feared that foreign goods will be abused and discriminated against by the Japanese side when they are inspected in the future. Foreigners are particularly concerned about this.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Special Registration Method for Party Members <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Drafted by the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, considering that the general registration held by the Party in the 17th year was too strict, resulting in some comrades with a revolutionary history losing their opportunity and not obtaining appropriate Party membership, specially formulated the "Special Registration Method for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang" as follows:</p>
<p>Request Credentials: (1) Anyone who has one of the following circumstances may request special registration: A. A member of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it; B. A member of the Kuomintang, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it; C. A member of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it; D. Anyone who obtained Party membership from the reorganization of the Party in the 13th year to the general registration in the 17th year, with a membership certificate or other credentials sufficient to prove it. If the special registrant in items A, B, and C has no sufficient credentials, but has two or more current members or party members who were members or party members at the time and issue a written proof, which is approved by the Central Committee, may also request special registration. The certificate of proof is to be determined separately.</p>
<p>Required Procedures: (2) Anyone who meets the requirements of the preceding paragraph shall, when requesting special registration, submit the credentials or certificate of proof, fill out the special registration form, and attach two recent two-and-a-half-inch half-length photos and send them directly to the Central Organization Department. After passing the examination, the Party member certificate will be issued and reported to the Central Standing Committee for record. The special registration form is to be determined separately. (3) This method shall be implemented upon resolution by the Central Executive Committee meeting.</p>

(2) Wood Seal: All stores participating in the charity sale shall affix a charity sale wood seal on the invoices for all goods sold on that day. (3) Submit to the Bank: The day's business income, after deducting the original capital, all profits, should be submitted to Shanghai banks before 12:00 noon the next day and ask them to present it to the government on their behalf. It is even better if both the principal and interest are presented together (4) Public Announcement in the Newspaper: All stores participating in the charity sale may make a public announcement in the newspaper to all sectors of society in advance. The total amount of profits for one day may also be announced in the newspaper to all sectors of society to show good faith.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Off the Coast of Wenzhou: British Ship Lost and Sunk; Whether it is the Kai Bo Ship Cannot be Confirmed, Only the Chimney Markings Indicate a Chinese Ship <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, various radio stations in this city received a telegram from the De Ping ship of the China-Italy Company at the mouth of the Ou River, stating that a ship had sunk near Songmenshan, off the coast of Wenzhou, at a position of 121.38 degrees east longitude and 28.16 degrees north latitude. Only the two chimneys and masts were seen protruding from the water. After observing the chimney markings, it belongs to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a British company located at 93 Guangdong Road. After receiving the news, the reporter went to inquire. According to the answer, the above telegram was indeed received, and it was said that there are two ships sailing on that route. One is leased to the Xinchang'an Company, named Xinronghua, sailing on the Fuzhou line, departing from Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (24th). The other is named Kaibo, weighing 3,075 tons, leased to the Lihe Foreign Firm's Moufu Shipping Department, sailing on the Shanghai-Oujiang-Ningbo-Qianpu line, and departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the day before yesterday (23rd). According to the ship's telegram, it arrived at Oujiang at around 9:00 AM on the 24th and anchored outside the port, and then went to the customs to complete the customs clearance. It started anchorage to Ningbo at 9:30 PM that afternoon. Therefore, it is not known which ship sank there. However, after the city received the telegram yesterday morning, it sent calls to the two ships from three radio stations. As of 6:00 PM, there was still no definite news. The truth can be clarified today.</p>

<p>Rejecting Threats and Inducements</p>
<p>The so-called president of the Japan International Film News Agency, Ichioka Aya, who is attempting to attack the Chinese film industry and expanding the Japanese film market in North China and Shanghai, has now dispatched minions to actively engage in activities in Shanghai. However, the Shanghai film industry understands the righteousness and will never cooperate with the Japanese side, no matter how difficult the environment. It is reported that the Japanese side has recently sent people to various companies, requesting them to send domestic films to be shown in various occupied areas, and at the same time intends to seize the right to censor films in Shanghai. It is rumored that the Japanese side also intends to host a banquet for the heads of various companies in the coming days, but given the firm attitude of the various companies, and the fact that the facilities of the various companies after the war are all decided by the entire staff, the Shanghai film industry, which has a glorious history, will definitely resolutely reject all threats and inducements from the Japanese side.</p>

<p>Increasing Wartime Economic Strength; Striving to Promote Thrift in Light of Local Circumstances</p>
<p>In order to increase the strength of the war of resistance and cultivate a frugal national spirit, the government authorities are promoting a thrift movement, which is now being universally implemented domestically. Overseas compatriots have recently also been instructed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to comply with local circumstances. The gist of the content is: the First Session of the People's Political Council proposed the promotion of the overseas Chinese thrift movement, which was resolved by the Supreme National Defense Council and handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for handling. It is now found that the thrift movement is an important task for our country at present. The thrift and contribution of overseas Chinese to the motherland is also extremely beneficial to foreign exchange and the economic future of the motherland. The general outline of thrift has already been promulgated, and overseas compatriots can strive to promote it in light of local circumstances without violating the principles.</p>

<p>The Committee of Commercial Representatives organized by the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council to review the salary increase plan has been working for several days. Foreign ratepayers such as Steadward, fearing that the committee would act hastily and without thorough investigation, and submit a report, sent a letter to the committee, requesting to attend the meeting and discuss it together. According to the gazette issued by the committee yesterday, when the committee meets at 4:15 PM on the 26th, it will invite Steadward and three or four other representatives of the ratepayers to attend the meeting to listen to their opinions. However, the names of all attendees must be notified to the committee before noon that day.</p>

<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, two Shandong peddlers injured last night came to Shanghai and were admitted to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to their account of the injuries, guerrilla forces of Chinese troops have been discovered in the Minhang area. When they were carrying their homemade pancakes to sell there yesterday morning, they happened to encounter Chinese troops attacking the Japanese army supply station. The fighting was extremely fierce, causing them to be injured by stray bullets, so they crawled to Shanghai for treatment.</p>

<p>Extremely Active Around Yanghang, Weak Japanese Army Holds Still</p>
<p>In the Yanghang Township area under Baoshan County, there is currently a Chinese army guerrilla force operating and controlling the water and land transportation in the surrounding villages. The Japanese army in the county seat does not dare to underestimate or attack this force, and due to their weak strength, they are holding still. In order to actively carry out anti-traitor work, the guerrilla force recently captured several "detectives" sent by the Shanghai puppet "Detective Team," selecting two who were loyal to serving as slaves and spying on the guerrilla force's activities for the Japanese. After interrogation, the two puppet "detectives" admitted to specializing in sabotaging the guerrilla force's work and have been executed by firing squad at a certain location. Before long, the translator of the town's puppet "police station" was also captured by the guerrilla force the day before yesterday. The reason for the arrest was also for specializing in serving as a spy for the Japanese army. After the two incidents occurred, the Japanese puppets were greatly frightened and have been intensifying their defenses in the Songbao area in recent days, it is said.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Yuehan Railway has been interrupted, and passengers and goods intending to go to the Northwest and Southwest have changed their routes to transit through Hanoi to various destinations. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday about the transit procedures for passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Hanoi, as follows: All passengers traveling to Hanoi, regardless of gender, must obtain a passport from the visa office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong before departure, and then obtain a visa from the French Consulate before being allowed to land upon arrival in French territory. This is a routine procedure. The transit procedures after arriving in Hanoi include: (1) Paying transit tax on passengers and goods. The tax rate is in accordance with the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty. For Chinese goods exported from China, passing through Vietnam, and then entering China, a transit tax must be paid when passing through Vietnam, at a rate of one percent of the value. For non-Chinese goods or goods not shipped from Chinese territory, a transit tax of four percent of the value is levied. However, passenger goods are also handled at a rate of one percent of the value. (2) Customs clearance procedures: After import goods are declared and taxed, the goods can be picked up. However, transit goods cannot be picked up and must be guaranteed by a reliable local store to ensure that the goods will not be used or sold in Vietnam. Inspection is very strict, and once discovered, the penalties are particularly severe.</p>

<p>Rickshaw Dealers Did Not Follow Regulations, the Bureau of Works Sent a Letter to the Guild to Notify</p>
<p>Since the Bureau of Works announced that new rickshaw designs would be used starting January 1st, many rickshaw dealers have continued to violate the regulations. Yesterday, a notice was sent to the rickshaw guild stating: "The improved rickshaw design has been approved by the board of directors of the Bureau of Works. The design is currently on display on Gordon Road. In the past two or three weeks, rickshaw dealers who have replaced rickshaws have not followed the improved design. Therefore, it is hereby notified that all rickshaw dealers must install new rickshaws according to the improved design from now on, except for those with completed bodies and paint. Otherwise, they will not be inspected."</p>

<p>The National Government Appoints Consul General in San Francisco as Chairman of the "Chinese Village"</p>
<p>The goods from Shanghai manufacturers participating in the United States International Exposition have been collected and prepared thanks to the active efforts of Mr. Lu Shoulian, manager of the International Hotel. They include jade, porcelain, lacquerware, brocade, blankets, Lama hanging images, and handicrafts, totaling more than 200 boxes. They will be loaded onto the Japanese Outer Queen Wheel of the Changxing Company today for transport to the United States for exhibition. The ship will leave Shanghai for the United States tomorrow morning and is expected to arrive in San Francisco in time for the opening of the conference on February 13th or 14th. In addition to Mr. Lu himself, the Shanghai participating representatives will also include Qin Runsheng and Wang Chunzhe, who will remain in Shanghai to negotiate the subsequent shipment of goods to the United States. The management team will be represented by Zhang Danzi, Wu Daochang, and Jin Silang, who will be dispatched by Mr. Lu to take care of everything.</p>
<p>As for the personnel sent to Hangzhou to collect goods, they have already returned to Shanghai and have collected many famous local specialties and handicrafts, such as clay figurines, rattan baskets, etc. These items are quite exquisite and will be rushed to produce more so that they can be shipped to the United States for exhibition and purchased by Americans. In addition, a batch of jadeite was collected, but due to the urgent preparation time and the time-consuming installation, it could not be packed and shipped to the United States on schedule. It will be transported continuously in the coming days. Although the Chinese government authorities do not intend to send personnel to the United States to participate due to the ongoing war, in order to promote China's inherent art, the National Government has telegraphed the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco, USA, to serve as the chairman of the "Chinese Village" at the conference. Regarding the rumors that Cheng Yanqiu and others will be invited to participate, it is said that this is not true. However, Mr. Lu hopes that the handicrafts produced by refugees in Shanghai and the local handicrafts sold in the former Chenghuang Temple can be welcomed by the general public. He himself hopes that local handicraft merchants will contact the International Hotel for arrangements to ship them to the United States for participation and to promote China's inherent art.</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments and the guilds of the banking industry: "According to reliable reports, Japan has secretly printed tens of millions of dollars of our legal tender in Shanghai and is using Japanese spies, residents, and traitors to circulate them in various places. It is now reported that the printing has been completed." The Ministry of Finance believes that the Japanese secretly printing legal tender in Shanghai and circulating it in various places has a significant impact on finance. Therefore, it is appropriate to issue a general order for attention, investigation, and prohibition to prevent this. In addition to secretly forwarding the information to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, and instructing their branches to pay attention and secretly ordering the Shanghai branch to obtain counterfeit notes, identify the differences between genuine and counterfeit notes, and report and telegraph the information, we are correspondingly requesting that you investigate and prohibit your subordinates from paying attention, investigating, and prohibiting this matter.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Customs Notified According to Order, Totaling 54 Items of Cotton</p>
<p>The Shanghai shipping companies received a telegram from the Ningbo Shipping Association yesterday, stating that they had received a notice from Zhejiang Customs, which stated that they had received a telegram from the Chief Inspector of Customs of the Ministry of Finance: "Strictly investigate and prohibit the transportation of materials aiding the enemy, totaling 54 items, including cotton and its products. Shanghai is a place controlled by enemy violence and should be subject to a preliminary ban on transportation. Please comply accordingly." In addition to handling the transportation, we hope you will inform all shipping companies. According to the shipping industry's statement to the Modern News Agency reporter, if the order is formally implemented, ships traveling on the Shanghai-Oujiang-Taizhou-Ningbo routes will have no cargo to carry when returning to Shanghai. The companies are considering reducing the number of voyages to avoid losses.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Foreign Reporters Discuss the Imminent Collapse of the Japanese Army <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Currently in a Frequent State of Economic Bankruptcy, Possible Defeat and Depletion of Resources</p>
<p>The Continental Press reports that Mr. Zhang Bolun, the Far East correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor in Tokyo, traveled to North China and Manchuria after departing from Tokyo at the beginning of this month and arrived in Shanghai three days ago. Yesterday (the 24th), he told reporters that Japan's arrogance has been damaged by the protracted Sino-Japanese War. However, the Japanese people still console themselves by saying that this war is not only with China but also with the great powers.</p>
<p>As far as Japan is concerned, this war is far from over, and no one in Japan knows how it will end. Japan is frequently on the verge of economic bankruptcy, and the collapse of the Japanese military is not far away. There are two things that could immediately change the war situation: One is that a disastrous defeat on the battlefield would collapse the spirit of the Japanese people. China's guerrilla warfare can contain the Japanese army's advance or obstruct the Japanese army's transportation lines, but it cannot achieve a major victory on the battlefield. On the other hand, the depletion of manpower and food supplies can also lead to the collapse of the Japanese army. The reduction in Japan's imports has already affected its industries. Cotton, zinc, wool, and kerosene are Japan's major imports, but they can no longer be imported at will. Japan is transporting its goods to the so-called yen bloc countries to make up for part of the losses it has suffered from importing raw materials from foreign countries, but this move still cannot increase its foreign exchange reserves. This war has obscured Japanese liberalism, and even the Social People's Party has leaned to the right towards the military. To please the masses, the Japanese military often attacks capitalists as exploiters for the sake of the poor.</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers are simply echoing the Japanese government's "suggestions." In short, the Japanese people hope to know more about the outside world's dynamics and believe that the war is true. It is reported that Mr. Zhang went to Tokyo from Moscow four years ago as a correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor. He will travel to China this time and then travel to Vietnam via Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued a notice to administrative agencies and people's organizations in various regions stating that many national goods factories in the war zones have changed their organizations after the war, or have been taken over by the enemy, or have even invested in cooperation. It is obvious that all their products are no longer entirely national goods. The various certificates of national goods issued before the war should be deemed invalid. Those operated with enemy funds should be prohibited from transporting and selling their products everywhere. In addition, it has issued multiple investigation forms for national goods factories, ordering them to investigate in detail the general situation of the factories after the war and the changes in their organizations in order to understand the situation and avoid being deceived.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Endocrinology: Progressive Transformation <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Animal Suffering, Human Gospel</p>
<p>The progress of endocrinology is entirely based on the success of animal experiments. After careful research by numerous experts, it has been proven that the endocrine hormones of animals with the same physical constitution as humans, such as chimpanzees, cattle, sheep, and sea dogs, can be supplied to the human body to achieve rejuvenation. It has also been discovered that ingesting the lungs, heart, blood vessels, or liver of the above-mentioned animals can be used to supplement human organs when they are diseased. This is the modern endocrine therapy that has shocked the medical world. However, this invention has been improved through the efforts of numerous experts, so it is constantly progressing rapidly.</p>
<p>Now, its effective components can be extracted and used for therapeutic applications. In terms of usage, simplicity and effectiveness are sought, from injections to oral medications. The goal is for a small amount of medicine to exert a large effect, which has created the brilliant state of modern endocrinology.</p>
<p>At the same time, through multifaceted experiments, it has been determined that the endocrine hormones in the testicles are more effective than anything else, because the testicles contain an ingredient that can not only promote physical strength, enhance fertility, and relieve neurasthenia, but also has the effect of rejuvenation.</p>
<p>The only genuine testicular endocrine preparation is "Biocomplex," invented by Dr. Mellen of Germany, which is an effective medicine for treating premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, infertility after marriage, and neurasthenia. The rest are just using the name to attract attention. Dr. Flandin, a famous French doctor, conducted multiple tests on "Biocomplex" and proved that the seminal essence of animal testicles is most abundant in chimpanzees, and the nature of chimpanzees is most compatible with the human body. Therefore, the medicine has absolutely no side effects such as temporary excitement and irritation of the stomach and intestines. It is the most perfect preparation for promoting limb prosperity and rejuvenating. For women, "Biocomplex for Women" can be taken to regulate menstruation and beautify the complexion.</p>
<p>This chimpanzee is raised by Dr. Mellen, a German endocrine expert. Its children have all sacrificed their lives in the doctor's laboratory. It can be said that they are the crystallization of his love and have donated their bodies to improve human health. Therefore, governments around the world have issued orders prohibiting the export and hunting of apes and monkeys, fearing that they may become extinct in the long run.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Conditions for Radical Cure of Lung Disease <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Because health knowledge is not popularized among Chinese people, most people contract lung disease as a result. Because this disease is extremely persistent, it has created a bad impression that lung disease is difficult to cure. In fact, this kind of wrong concept needs to be eliminated to avoid being captured by the disease demon. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as general doctors say, and on the contrary, lung disease can really be cured, as long as the treatment and health maintenance are in harmony, there is nothing mysterious. This is what I have gained from more than 20 years of experience. I always use "Bu Fei Na'er" to search for tuberculosis, nourish the lungs, relieve cough and eliminate phlegm, and fill the lung cavities. No matter if the disease has reached the second or third stage with hemoptysis, it can be absolutely cured by taking it. However, during the cure, it is advisable to be quiet, not to work, and to consume more nutritious foods. These are the necessary conditions for the cure of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Relationship Between Sexual Desire and Gonorrhea <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and Sexual Activity</p>
<p>Before gonorrhea is cured, the maintenance of health is not to be neglected. Among them, the maintenance of sexual desire is essential. It is necessary to pay attention to diet, labor, etc., because gonorrhea patients do not maintain health in these places and engage in excessive sexual activity. Then their resistance will inevitably be weakened, and the latent gonococci will inevitably take advantage of the patient's weakened resistance to wreak havoc. All kinds of complications arise from this. Therefore, maintaining health is the most important thing before gonorrhea is cured. I will reiterate it again, because gonococci are quite resistant, and their resistance in the human body is stronger than in a test tube. Therefore, even if the patient has a high fever of about 40 degrees, they can still maintain their survival. Based on this reason, the general internal medicine for gonorrhea that claims to be able to cure gonorrhea radically in three to five days is obviously based on facts and mostly fails. Moreover, a falsely self-cured disease that has not been cured will recur easily with a little negligence in health maintenance, such as sexual activity and alcoholism, causing endless troubles. It is important to pay attention!</p>
<p>Appropriate Treatment</p>
<p>I have always seen that when patients first get sick, they abuse inferior medicines that have not been introduced by doctors. Although they may get a little relief for a while, they often have sexual intercourse with their wives, resulting in mutual infection and permanent difficulty in curing. However, when I encounter this situation, I must instruct the sick couple to temporarily sleep in separate beds and treat them at the same time. I use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy to remove the gonorrhea toxin, and I also prescribe the sacred medicine for gonorrhea, "Kelinong," to eliminate the widespread gonococci inside. It can be effective in a short period of time. If the wife has been infected, she can use "Ca'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, and also take "Kelinong," then the excellent effect will exceed our imagination. It is absolutely foolproof. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen every day, and each number will only cost five jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Talking About Freckle Preparations in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Laboratory <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Zuihong</p>
<p>Freckles are a type of skin pigmentation. They are mostly a skin condition caused by nerve and blood vessel disorders. It can also be caused by applying inferior cosmetics containing lead. Generally, young girls who suffer from freckles occasionally run to the pharmacy to buy a bottle of freckle lotion. As a result, the freckles are not removed, but the face becomes red, swollen, painful, dry, and cracked. This is because the lotion contains mercury and acid-based drugs, but lacks sufficient emollients and soothing agents. Moreover, lotions are very easy to dry. When applied to the face, often before the medicinal properties arrive, the lotion has already dried up. At the same time, because of the drastic medicinal properties, the skin feels very painful. Therefore, freckle medicine is fundamentally unsuitable for making lotions. Then, can the various emerging miscellaneous brands of vanishing cream on the market treat freckles? Some people who have experience using vanishing cream can generally answer that. Vanishing cream is used every day. I ask, how much can freckles be removed? Experience is the answer. Facts speak louder than words. Vanishing cream is stearic acid and an alkaline compound. It only has the ability to whiten and moisturize. Some even lack glycerin, so the moisturizing ability has disappeared. Beauty and freckle removal are out of the question. Beauty and freckle removal must have beauty and freckle removal ingredients. It cannot be considered just by talking about it. Then, is the scientifically advanced beauty product "Mianli" that is popular on the market now also a vanishing cream? No! Absolutely not. The powder quality of "Mianli" is smooth, soft, and delicate, unlike vanishing cream, which is dry, greasy, and congealed. This indicates that "Mianli" has undergone a refining process and has been added with beauty ingredients and freckle-removing medicine. Moreover, after being spread on the palm, the powder quality can still be identified, unlike vanishing cream, which only has some water quality after being ground. This indicates that "Mianli" really has beauty and freckle-removing ingredients inside. Therefore, it can be said to be definitely effective. "Mianli" also has an extremely reliable guarantee, which is the pharmaceutical permit number 1298 from the Central Health Administration. The freckle-removing and beauty ingredients inside have been chemically tested. Of course, it is more reliable than our chemical tests. Therefore, talking about freckle preparations, I think "Mianli" is a very valuable special product. In terms of beauty contribution, it has created the most glorious page. This seems to be undeniable! The fragrance of "Mianli" previously had ABC types. Recently, a new type D fragrance has been released, which is quiet and fragrant, more lovely than the others, and the value is more noble than the others. It must be even more popular. The manufacturer of "Mianli" is the well-known Tongren Pharmacy in the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry. Major pharmacies and department stores are selling it.</p>
<p>Using inferior cosmetics every day will greatly harm your face.</p>

<h3 id="e69">A New Understanding of Gonorrhea <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Described by Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA</p>
<p>"Gonorrhea is difficult to cure" is almost a universal cry, but in reality, people have no understanding of the truth of gonorrhea. They echo each other, so gonorrhea patients are always in a pessimistic atmosphere, allowing the hateful gonococci to spread and grow, causing all kinds of dangerous symptoms. This is because they have no new understanding of gonorrhea itself and are only limited to old concepts. Furthermore, they use outdated symptomatic treatment methods, such as claiming that it can be cured in three to five days, and newly released over-the-counter medicines on the market. In fact, their effectiveness is the same as the old, useless over-the-counter medicines. Originally, cunning and stubborn gonococci have strong infectivity and rich reproductive capacity, so general internal medicine and local surgery are ultimately difficult to achieve their full effect. It must have a therapy that surrounds the gonococci and directly kills them to be effective.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, first invented "Kelinong," a drug synthesized from a mixture of protein and yellow pigment, based on the principle of non-specific gonorrhea toxin therapy. He used animal experiments, gradually improved it, and spent more than 30 years of research effort to finally achieve success. Regardless of new or old leucorrhea, just taking "Kelinong" for a few hours will produce its bactericidal effect in the blood, and each cell will also have an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. Therefore, the inflammation and swelling caused by gonococci, the difficulty of urination, the various pains of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes, and the combination of pus and blood can be eliminated. It is effective to treat two or more complications of gonorrhea at the same time by taking "Kelinong." This is a unique effect of "Kelinong" and cannot be compared with other inferior medicines. It has been unanimously recognized by venereal disease specialists in hospitals in various countries as an effective drug for gonorrhea, so they have explained the process of the efficacy of this drug in major medical journals, which proves its excellent value. As for external medicine, according to my experience, "Kanglin Water" has a wonderful effect of complementing "Kelinong." Patients can wash the urethra at home according to the instructions of "Kanglin Water" to clear the gonococci on the mucous membrane. Women can use "Ca'er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, so the gonococci and leucorrhea in the vagina can be swept away and cleared. The power is difficult to describe (Note: "Kanglin Water" is sold in both Chinese and Western Taihe Pharmacies)</p>

<p>— Zheng Ting, MD, Germany</p>
<p>The patient, Tang Yunzhang, resides at No. 22 Yongan Lane, Carter Road, this city. He is a business student, 21 years old. At the age of 18, he mistakenly committed masturbation and gradually became a habit. After a long time, he had frequent nocturnal emissions, muscle wasting, and a pale complexion. He was mentally depressed, lacked energy, and sometimes had tinnitus and headaches. He began to feel terrified, so he resolved to quit masturbation and then took various Chinese and Western medicines, hoping to nourish his losses and stop nocturnal emissions. He took three boxes of solid essence pills without effect. He then consulted a Chinese medicine practitioner to prescribe a prescription for nourishment, but there was no hope of radical cure. Fortunately, in the autumn of last year, he was introduced by a fellow patient to the Juyan Hospital for the latest electrotherapy, and he took the French "Nais Nocturnal Emission Tablets" for nocturnal emission, and also used the German "Biocomplex" to supplement it. In the first week, he felt comfortable sleeping and had fewer erotic dreams. Therefore, nocturnal emission stopped. In the second week, he was energetic, his appetite increased, he was energetic during the day, and he did not feel tired when working. In the fifth week of taking it, he gained four pounds, and all the symptoms were completely cured, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e73">A Review and Prospect of China's Accounting Academic and Accounting Profession (Continued) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Xulun</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>After the National Government settled in the Southeast in 1927, and the country was unified in 1928, although civil wars still occurred sporadically, domestic construction gradually returned to normal. At that time, in the Southeast region, due to the abolition of likin and the reform of the tax system, the establishment of textile, cement, rubber, match, and other daily necessities industries gradually increased. In addition, the research on domestic commercial science became more widespread, and the opportunity for rationalized management became increasingly mature. Therefore, the improvement of industrial and commercial accounting was extremely significant. The popularization of accounting education greatly contributed to promoting this trend. Before 1927, the business courses of domestic universities and specialized schools used original English and American textbooks for bookkeeping and accounting, which were incompatible with China's accounting practices. The books published in the market were mainly about basic bookkeeping, and more advanced books were rarely seen. In the spring of 1928, the Lixin Accounting Tutoring School was established. In 1930, my book "Advanced Commercial Bookkeeping Textbook" was published. In 1933, two types of publications were created: the "Lixin Accounting Journal" edited by me and the "Accounting Magazine" edited by Xu Yongzuo. By 1936, the "Lixin Accounting Series" edited by me had published 30 types. The number of types of translations and publications by other publishers was also higher than in any previous period, and the establishment of accounting tutoring schools had spread throughout major cities in the country. Accounting education was popularized among accounting practitioners in general industrial and commercial enterprises, and the business of accountants became increasingly developed due to the increasing number of commercial affairs (as of recently, a total of 1,500 people have obtained accountant certificates, and there are already more than ten domestic accountant associations). Businessmen found it necessary to improve their accounting systems. Therefore, not only large-scale industrial and commercial enterprises improved their systems, but also smaller enterprises followed suit in large numbers. This situation reached its peak with the implementation of income tax collection in 1937.</p>
<p>According to Chinese laws and regulations, such as the General Rules for Merchants and the Company Law, there are provisions regarding the recording of books, the calculation of profits and losses, and the distribution of profits for commercial enterprises. However, before 1921, various enterprises failed to strictly implement these due to social customs. After 1927, the Civil Code and other important commercial laws were promulgated and amended successively, and enforcement became stricter, which had a significant impact on promoting accounting reform. In 1932, the business tax system was promulgated. Because the tax system used business turnover as the tax base, it seemed to have some impact on accounting improvement. As a result, the adoption of the contracted payment system for taxation did not "conflict" with the old habits of merchants. With the promulgation of the income tax system, the calculation of taxable income was based on actual profits and capital. Therefore, a good accounting system was not only necessary for operation and management, but also indispensable for fair taxation. As a result, accounting education became more widespread in local chambers of commerce and trade associations, and the business of accountants became increasingly developed. Students in universities, middle schools, and tutoring schools who were proficient in accounting found it as easy to find employment as civil engineering students were sought after when large-scale highways were being built. It is no exaggeration to call this the golden age of China's accounting academic and accounting profession. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Details of the Forced Road Construction in the Pudong Japanese Naval Defense Zone <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Many Civilian Houses Demolished Along the Road; Guard Posts Set Up Everywhere to Prevent Attacks</p>
<p>The Pudong Japanese Naval Defense Zone, listening to the advice of traitors, used the means of "controlling the Chinese with the Chinese" to force villagers in various places to participate in voluntary road construction or widening in order to facilitate the movement of the Japanese army and eliminate the threat of guerrillas. Since the beginning of this effort, hundreds of unarmed people have completed</p>
<p>Four Routes</p>
<p>under violent oppression.</p>
<p>According to on-site investigation yesterday: (1) The new road connecting No. 6 Bridge on Pudong Avenue to the original road of Qinci Yangdian starts from Qinci Yangdian straight south, passes through Laoya Ke, and reaches Zhangjia Lou. From the eastern end of Zhangjia Lou, it turns southwest and arrives at Qijia Miao (the entire line is five li long). (2) From Yangjing Xizha Kou, it goes straight south to Tangjia Nong, with a total length of</p>
<p>Three Li.</p>
<p>(3) From Zhangjia Lou, it goes straight west, passes through Xieao Di, makes a small turn, continues west, and passes through Lujia Zhai Bridge, Qianjia Xiang, and reaches Yangjia Du, with a total length of six li. (4) From Gongchang Zhan, it goes south, passes through Meiyuan Wangjia Bridge, and reaches Cao'an, with a total length of three li. All four lines mentioned above have been completed. Each line is 20 feet wide and can accommodate two armored vehicles or military trucks side by side. Because there were existing small roads to follow,</p>
<p>Civilian Houses Demolished</p>
<p>in a total of two places. (1) Two shop houses of villager Chen Linsheng at the entrance of Sanguan Tang in Ya Zha Tan, west of Lujia Shi Bridge. (2) Two noodle shop houses of Zhao Songlin opened at the north end of Lujia Shi Bridge. No compensation was paid for the owners' losses. In addition, the farmland occupied on both sides of the four roads is estimated to be around 100 mu. After the farmers' land was occupied, they were all</p>
<p>Heartbroken</p>
<p>Bearing the pain and swallowing their anger, they had no way to complain. After the four roads were forcibly built by the Japanese army, the sentries on the original Pudong Avenue have expanded southward. On Yangjing West Shi Street Road, three sentry posts have been added at Minsheng Road intersection, Qinci Yangdian, and Cao An, with sandbags piled up. At the southern end of the new road (four or five li south of Shi Street),</p>
<p>Additional Sentry Posts</p>
<p>have been set up at five locations: Tangjie Nong, San Zhuang Miao, Zhangjia Lou, Qijia Miao, and Xieao Di. Sandbags are piled up at each location, and two or three soldiers are stationed. Furthermore, a Marine Corps sub-unit has been set up at Chen Zhangrong's house in front of Qinci Yangdian, guarded by seventy or eighty sailors. A small squad unit has been set up at Zhao Zhangzhang's house at Lujia Zhai Bridge, with twenty or thirty soldiers. Zhangjia Lou is also a small squad unit, with twenty or thirty soldiers. Considering the sudden construction of defenses and the tension in the air in various places, it is clear that they are trying to prevent the actions of the Chinese army on the anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident. Their fear of the guerrillas can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e77">1938 Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report (Continued) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>(Worker's Livelihood Survey) Mr. Cai Zhengya, former chief of the Statistics Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, is now serving at the China Statistical Society, but has an office in the Industrial Section and is responsible for investigating workers' livelihoods and statistical work. His achievements have greatly benefited the Bureau. Therefore, the annual report of the Industrial Section for the past year contains important information about workers' livelihoods, which was not available in previous annual reports of the Industrial Section.</p>
<p>Judging from the results of the study of the cost of living in this city, one of the most noteworthy aspects is the decline in the purchasing power of money. In July 1937, what could be purchased with one yuan in national currency now requires one yuan and forty-seven cents in national currency. In other words, one yuan in national currency in July 1937 is now worth only sixty-eight cents.</p>
<p>The following sections are extracted from Mr. Cai's original report. Due to space limitations, the various tables referred to cannot be included.</p>
<p>(1) (Cost of Living Index and Retail Prices) The cost of living index for workers in this city started in 1926, and that year is used as the standard for comparison. The total index is divided into five categories: food, rent, clothing, fuel, and miscellaneous. The weight of each category can be roughly determined from the percentage of each category's expenditure in the average household. In the total expenditure, food accounts for 53.2%, with the expenditure on rice being the largest. Rent accounts for 8.3%, clothing 7.5%, fuel 6.4%, and miscellaneous 24.6%. (2) In 1937, the total index was 124.11, which was 18.15% higher than in 1936. If we compare the monthly index from August to December 1937 with July 1937 before the war, the increase is much more than this. During these five months, the highest total index was in November, which was 159.08, an increase of 45% compared with July (109.51). In other words, in the five months after August 13th, the cost of living increased sharply by half.</p>
<p>(3) Comparing 1938 with July 1937, the category index with the sharpest increase was rent, followed by fuel, then miscellaneous, then food, and clothing was the lowest. The annual index for the rent category in 1938 was 289.14, an increase of 156.9% compared with July before the war (112.56). The index from January to June was 276.72, and from July to December it was 301.56. The annual index for the fuel category was 242.59, an increase of 62.5% compared with July before the war (249.25). The monthly index was the lowest in May (214.48) and the highest in January (291.22). (To be continued)</p>

<p>Jiang Genlin from Zhenjiang, Lin Guichun from Yangzhou, Chen Songbao, etc., from 4 PM on the 13th of this month to 8 PM on the 15th, used threats to extort 415 yuan in cash and a gold watch from Xu Youhong in Room 4 of the Beixin Hotel on West Station Road, Caotoutou, Jessfield Road. Xu reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and detectives Guan Huchen and Tie Guobin arrested Jiang and the other</p>
<p>three people</p>
<p>on the 17th in Room 207 of the Qinghe Hotel, Lane 108, Zhejiang Road, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is learned that Xu Youhong is 30 years old, from Yangzhou, and lives with his wife, Pang, at No. 81 Rongqing Li, Jessfield Road. His father used to run a restaurant in Fengtian, accumulating a huge fortune. Later, due to old age, he took his concubine and her two daughters, Guizhen (26 years old) and Xiuying (16 years old), to Shanghai for vacation. In July of this year, his father died, and Xu Youhong inherited this</p>
<p>huge inheritance</p>
<p>which he hid in his home, unexpectedly arousing the covetousness of his relatives, resulting in an unfortunate incident. At about 1 PM on the 13th of this month, more than ten people, including pseudo-police and "detectives" Xia Chao, Yang Qing, and Wang Rongshan from the pseudo "Police Bureau" of the "Da Dao Municipal Government," detective accomplices Yang Guisheng, and Japanese people, six of whom were carrying pistols, rushed into Xu's house, accusing Xu of being a guerrilla and conducting a large-scale search. At that time, Xu was out, so they drove away his wife and searched for a long time. Before leaving, they took Guizhen and Xiuying</p>
<p>two daughters</p>
<p>away. At the same time, the detective accomplice Chen Guisheng instructed the defendants to wait at the bus station at the intersection of Jessfield Road and Kaina Road. At about 4 PM, Xu Youhong arrived by bus and was forced at gunpoint to enter Room 4 of the Beixin Hotel, where he was imprisoned. The 25 yuan in legal tender (10 yuan was used for room expenses) and a gold watch that Xu was carrying were all confiscated, and a huge sum of money was demanded. Initially, they demanded 100,000 yuan, then reduced it to 50,000 yuan, and finally reduced it to 1,000 yuan. That night, he</p>
<p>was imprisoned</p>
<p>and Lin and Chen, along with four others, were responsible for guarding him. At the same time, people were sent to contact Xu's aunt, Chen Dama, and Old Yang, the owner of the Hongfa Barber Shop at the entrance of Xu's alley. In fact, Chen Dama and Old Yang were both accomplices. Chen Dama tricked Xu's wife, Pang, out of 390 yuan. The gang then declared to Xu on the 15th, "Your matter has been taken care of, and you can leave now. However, for your future peace of mind, Xu</p>
<p>must write a red note</p>
<p>and worship Luo Ziping, a translator working for the Japanese, as his master," etc. Xu had no choice but to agree and was released. However, he did not dare to return home and lived with relatives. All the property in his home had been searched and emptied. Unexpectedly, the defendants were still not satisfied and demanded that Xu pay 600 yuan to redeem his two sisters. They agreed to negotiate at the Qinghe Hotel, which led to Xu reporting the crime and being arrested. The police station, having learned the previous situation,</p>
<p>Japanese Headquarters</p>
<p>regarding the detention of Xu Guizhen and Xiuying. It was confirmed that this was the case. If they were found to be unrelated, they would be released. However, they were unaware of the defendants' extortion. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu opened the trial to interrogate them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the above situation. After the court questioned the defendants one by one, it ordered a postponement for further investigation.</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th of this month at 12:00 AM, the French police uncovered a gang of pickpockets and purse snatchers in Shanghai in Rooms 224 and 226 of the Continental Apartments at 431 Bubbling Well Road. When they went to arrest them, the gang was gambling on Pai Gow and poker in Room 224, while people were smoking opium morphine in Room 226. They arrested 26 men and women, including Liu Shan, Wu Laisheng, Kong Bingren, Wang Zhongwen, Yang Jiren, and women Wu Peng, Yang Zhou, and Zhang Shen, and confiscated gambling tools, gambling money, opium morphine, and opium pipes. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao Yuan came to the First Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer for the French Concession administration, presented the case and prosecuted according to law. After the court questioned the defendants in detail, it ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

<p>Liang Bei, a woman from Suzhou (age 46), residing at No. 6, Lane 363, Gordon Road, recently abused her 11-year-old adopted daughter, Lian Zhen, who is from Liyang, by frequently beating her. The other day, a neighbor reported this in a letter to the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association on Hart Road. The association sent representative investigator Liu Wenlin to rush to the address. Upon investigation, it was found that Liang Lianzhen had several severe beatings on her legs and back, with obvious bruising. This was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge, and detectives were dispatched to bring Liang Bei and the girl Lian Zhen to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday at 9:00 a.m. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and prosecuted her for abuse, requesting that Lian Zhen be sent to the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association for care because she did not want to return home. Subsequently, representatives from the Benevolent Children's Association, Liu Wenlin, and the girl Lian Zhen provided evidence. When questioned, Liang Bei's statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi sentenced Liang Bei to a fine of one hundred yuan, or to replace it with forced labor, calculated at two yuan per day. The girl Lian Zhen was temporarily sent to the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association for care.</p>

<p>Wang Zhancheng, from Chongming, engages in the miscellaneous grain business and travels between Kan and Chong. Wang also invested capital in the Southern Hotel at No. 462 Jiujiang Road in Shanghai. Therefore, he always stays at that hotel when he comes to Shanghai. Recently, Wang came to Shanghai again for business and stayed at the Southern Hotel. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 23rd of the month, three people suddenly went to Room 112 of the Southern Hotel. One of them was Wang's fellow villager. That person invited Wang to his</p>
<p>room to chat.</p>
<p>Wang, thinking they were fellow villagers, did not suspect anything. During the conversation, the three suddenly accused Wang of being a member of the Chinese guerrillas, saying that if he did not pay a large sum of money, they would send him to the Japanese military headquarters, where his life would not be spared. At the same time, they hired a car and forced Wang into it, taking him to a house in an alley at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road, where he was imprisoned.</p>
<p>Extorted 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>If he refused, they would immediately send him to the Japanese military headquarters. Wang Zhancheng, although he had no connection with the guerrillas, knew that once he reached the Japanese military headquarters, it would be difficult to explain. Therefore, he had to yield. But he told them that he only brought 600 yuan with him on this trip to Shanghai, and it would be difficult to comply with the amount of 10,000 yuan. After several hours of negotiation, they agreed to settle for 600 yuan, with Wang entrusting</p>
<p>the Southern Hotel</p>
<p>tea servant Zhou Wenbin to first withdraw 200 yuan from his deposit at the hotel's accounting room and hand it over. The remaining amount was scheduled to be paid at the Southern Hotel the day before yesterday (the 24th) between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. (only then would he regain his freedom). Afterwards, Wang, feeling resentful at being defrauded for no reason, reported the information to the Zhabei Police Station. As expected, the day before yesterday at 6:00 p.m., Zhu Huimin, a dismissed Chinese detective from Xuzhou, representing these extortionists, came to collect the remaining 400 yuan. He was</p>
<p>arrested</p>
<p>by Zhabei Police detective Zhang Keqin.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Fen and Clerk Zhou Jing'an took their seats for interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for extortion and fraud under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, and requested a postponement for further interrogation as the accomplices still needed to be apprehended. After the court questioned the defendant, Zhu was ordered to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>According to Continental News, a certain Japanese person, falsely posing as a member of the Japanese Special Service Department, along with three Chinese people, committed robbery in a hotel on the Nanjing Road side at 1:00 a.m. yesterday (the 24th). The Japanese person has been arrested by the police, but the three Chinese accomplices have managed to escape. The victim was a certain traveler in the hotel. Yesterday morning, four men in plain clothes suddenly entered his room, accused the traveler of being a guerrilla, tied him up, and searched for his money. They left the traveler in the room and went out, spending freely. When their pockets were empty, they returned and ordered a lavish breakfast in the traveler's room, paying for it with a watch they had stolen. At the same time, the robbed traveler managed to persuade the four bandits to let him go to the toilet. He left a message on the wall, saying that he was being held in the room and asked the manager to call the police. After the traveler returned to the room, the bandits did not tie him up again. Soon after, a tea servant entered the toilet and saw the message. However, the tea servant was also captured and beaten by the four. The robbed traveler then took advantage of the bandits' attack on the tea servant to sneak downstairs and report to the accounting room, who then called the police and arrested the Japanese person. During interrogation, the Japanese person admitted that he had no connection with the Special Service Department. Yesterday, the Police Department handed the Japanese person over to the Japanese authorities in this port, and it is said that he will be charged with robbery.</p>

<p>The Jing'an Temple Police Department, considering the recent robberies occurring frequently in the western suburbs of Shanghai, in addition to instructing all detectives to be extra vigilant, also dispatched special night patrols and extra patrols every night to ensure the safety of the neighborhood. Unexpectedly, near midnight the day before yesterday, while several patrol detectives were patrolling on Dunxin Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai, a gunshot suddenly rang out from the dark bushes on the border, seemingly aimed at the detectives. A black shadow was seen rushing into the Chinese territory after the gunshot and disappearing. The detectives, lacking concrete evidence, did not fire back. They searched the vicinity of the border but found nothing, and reported the situation to the police station, leaving the case pending investigation.</p>
<p>Russian Woman Shot</p>
<p>Near Bailinan Road, west of the Fanhuan渡 Station in the western suburbs of Shanghai, at around 8:40 p.m. the night before yesterday, a Russian couple was walking there when they encountered three robbers who stopped them. The Russian woman, in a moment of urgency, shouted for help, which offended the bandits. They fired a shot at the woman and fled into the darkness. The Russian woman was unable to dodge and was shot in the chest, falling to the ground in pain. Her husband managed to hire a car to take her to Hong'en Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police station to apprehend the criminals.</p>
<p>Business Firm Robbed</p>
<p>In a certain business firm at No. 419 Guangdong Road, at around 7:15 p.m. yesterday evening, three robbers suddenly disguised themselves as customers and went to commit robbery. Two robbers armed with guns entered the shop and held the accountants and shop assistants captive, forbidding them to make any noise. The remaining accomplices went inside to search, but there was no large sum of money in the cash register. They only managed to steal a sealed envelope containing one hundred yuan in paper money and fled. Afterwards, the shop owner reported the robbery to the police.</p>
<p>Boatman Shot</p>
<p>Fang Yimao, a 22-year-old boatman from Chongming, was fully loaded with yellow sand from his hometown and came to Shanghai to sell it. While sailing midway, he suddenly encountered a pirate ship that ordered him to stop. Fang was unwilling to show weakness and resisted bravely. As a result, the pirates fired several shots, hitting him severely in the chest. All the clothes and belongings on the boat were looted, and they left. It was not until 6:30 p.m. last night that he arrived here and sought treatment at Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>Robbers Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 p.m., four robbers went to No. 27, Siming Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin in the French Concession, to commit robbery. One robber, holding a gun, stood guard at the gate, while three robbers went upstairs into the room and intimidated the homeowner's family, forbidding them to make any noise. Just as they were ransacking the boxes and chests, the police headquarters of the Lu家湾 French Concession received a report and immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives, who rushed to encircle the area in police vehicles. The robber standing guard, seeing the arrival of the Chinese and foreign detectives, panicked and threw the gun he was holding into a coal basket in the homeowner's courtyard and fled. He was captured by the detectives. At the same time, the Chinese and foreign detectives rushed upstairs. The three robbers who were searching were unarmed and, seeing the Chinese and foreign detectives descending like generals from the sky, were terrified and surrendered. The detectives then found a gun in the coal basket and took it back to the police station along with the robbers for investigation and referral to the court for trial. The homeowner's family suffered no loss, which was fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Conclusion of the Bullet Gift Case; Defendant Acquitted <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Ji Xiaofeng and Wang Yigong Had a Grudge; Zhang Refused to Give False Testimony, Leading to False Accusation</p>
<p>Ji Xiaofeng, who worked as a lawyer's broker, recently became involved in a lawsuit on behalf of some shareholders of the Hengsheng Shipping Company, which had already ceased operations, against other shareholders. Wang Yigong, the manager of the Queen's Theater, assisted the opposing party in the lawsuit, leading Ji and Wang to become enemies. On the 3rd of this month, Ji suddenly reported to the police station in charge, saying that someone had sent</p>
<p>a box of cakes</p>
<p>to his house that morning, containing five bullets. At the time, Ji was unable to identify who sent the item, so he was told to wait for further investigation. After a week, Ji reported again, saying that a tailor who witnessed the delivery that day said it was Zhang Guohua, an employee of the Queen's Theater. The head of the police then dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Zhang and bring him to the First Special District District Court for questioning and detention. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai opened the Fourth Criminal Court for continued hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the defendant</p>
<p>had previously denied</p>
<p>sending the cake to Ji's house. Although the police had repeatedly investigated, he still firmly denied it. Ji Xiaofeng then recounted the incident. When questioned, the defendant said that he did not know Ji and that Ji had come to his house several times because of the ongoing intimidation case in the French Concession court, asking me to give false testimony in court in exchange for a large sum of money. I refused, fearing that he would harm me. I rejected him, etc. He also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. As a result, the court ruled that Zhang Guohua was not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Unscrupulous Merchants Manufacture Counterfeit Cigarettes <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Gang Uncovered, More Than Ten Male and Female Criminals Arrested; Main Culprit Wang Zhanmei Being Pursued for Joint Punishment</p>
<p>The cigarettes sold in the occupied areas along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are mostly counterfeit cigarettes of various well-known brands secretly manufactured in Shanghai by unscrupulous merchants and transported for sale. The cigarette boxes for these counterfeit cigarettes are collected from various cigarette paper shops, so the appearance is no different from the real ones. Recently, the police have repeatedly uncovered</p>
<p>counterfeit gangs,</p>
<p>but this kind of business is extremely profitable, so they rise again and again, making it difficult to eliminate them. Last month, No. 11, Lane 107, Parker Road, produced a branch of the French-owned Parisian Tobacco Company. Its manufacturing plant was set up at No. 7, Lane 90, Chihama Road, and a large number of female workers were recruited. Those who did not know thought it was a newly emerging formal company, but in fact, it was all counterfeiting the products of major Chinese and foreign tobacco companies. After the police department in charge secretly verified the facts, they first went to</p>
<p>the branch</p>
<p>and arrested Weng A'chang, Wang Jinrong, Xu Heshang, Li Kunyuan, and Zhao Chen, who were packaging cigarettes. Then they went to the manufacturing plant and arrested Qian Sheng, Zhang Baoqing, Shen Dingkang, Lin Haigen, Yu Wei, Li Guixiang, Wu Baodi, Zhou Meiyue, Chen Xingyue, Zhu Meiqing, Zhang A'e, and a total of sixteen people, seizing manufacturing machines, tobacco leaves, various brands of manufactured cigarettes, account books, receipts, and the carved wooden seal of the fake "Consolidated Tax Bureau." According to Weng and others, the owner's name is Wang Zhanmei, and he lives at No. 11, Dade Lane, Chengdu Road. When the detectives went to arrest him, he had already</p>
<p>fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the arrested men and women were escorted to the First Special District District Court for interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Xunwan explained the process of solving the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation to apprehend the main culprit for joint punishment. Judge Dai then interrogated the defendants, all of whom admitted that they were hired by Wang to manufacture counterfeit cigarettes. However, Yu Wei also stated that she was Wang's mistress. Wang had been unemployed since the war and started this business with a friend, with the capital being raised by pawning clothes. Judge Dai, upon obtaining the confession, ordered the defendants to be detained separately for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Trafficking in Human Beings; Reported to the Police and Arrested <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Lang, the ten-year-old daughter of Xu Luting, an Yixing native residing at No. 6, Hongzhang Lane, Gordon Road, disappeared while playing at the door at noon on November 14th of last year. The police were notified to search, but no trace was found. It was not until about 11:00 p.m. the day before yesterday that the girl was abandoned crying in front of the Great World in the French Concession. Someone asked the girl about her address and sent her back. Her father, Xu Luting, asked the girl and learned that she had been abducted and sold by Chen Xu, a fellow villager residing at the refugee camp on Connaught Road, to a certain place as an adopted daughter. She had recently contracted lung disease and was abandoned near the Great World, etc. Based on the information, he reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Chen. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the process. Judge Jiang Shuzi, after questioning her, ordered her to be detained for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Postal Service Restored; Hunan Province Postal Money Orders <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Acceptance of Small Package Mail to Various Provinces; Regulations on the Mailing of Official Documents and Attachments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received a fast telegram from the Hunan Postal Administration, ordering the temporary suspension of the opening of money orders. Yesterday, the bureau received another telegram from the Hunan Administration clarifying that the previous telegram was issued after the Changsha fire, when the situation in the province was chaotic, and was no longer applicable. Money orders throughout the province could now be opened and paid as usual. Therefore, the Shanghai Administration resumed postal money orders to Hunan from today. The maximum amount for money orders opened in Shanghai to places like Changsha in Hunan is 5,000 yuan, without the need to add additional fees. Other inland areas are subject to restrictions and a small supplementary fee. According to the Shanghai Administration, Guangzhou money orders have also been restored, but the maximum amount is limited to 50 yuan, with an additional supplementary fee of 15 cents per yuan. Apart from Guangzhou, only Shantou in the province can handle money orders, with a maximum amount of 200 yuan and a supplementary fee of 8 cents per yuan.</p>
<p>Small Package Mail</p>
<p>The joint sealing and distribution group for small package mail of the Shanghai Postal Administration previously announced the suspension of accepting small package mail to various places due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties. Now that transportation is slightly better, a notice was issued yesterday stating that from today, all types of small package mail to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces can be accepted again. However, small package mail to Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces must not exceed one kilogram per package. This is hereby notified. According to inquiries, the limit for each item to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan is five kilograms, with a mailing fee of two yuan per kilogram. For Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan, the limit is one kilogram per item, with a mailing fee of three yuan per kilogram.</p>
<p>Official Document Attachments</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1525 states: "Upon investigation, when various agencies mail official documents and attachments, if the official document and attachments are sealed together, the entire package should be charged as a letter according to regulations. If the official document and attachments are sealed separately but mailed at the same time, they must be tied together, but the official document must be charged as a letter and the attachments must be charged as small package mail, so that they can be delivered together by express delivery. However, in order to save postage, some senders also mail the attachments separately as printed matter. Currently, due to transportation difficulties in various places, the post office has to give priority to shipping light items such as letters and postcards, while heavy items such as printed matter are accumulated and sent later. This makes it inevitable that official document attachments cannot arrive at the same time as the official documents, causing great inconvenience in handling official business. To remedy this, if the sender insists on mailing the official document attachments as printed matter, it is best to send them as express printed matter and add the motor vehicle transportation loss fee (see this Bureau's Notice No. 1522 of December 8, 27), so that the attachments and official documents can arrive at the same time, so as not to hinder official business. This is hereby notified to all. This notice is issued by Director Zha Peilin on January 21, 28th year of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>At 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, the house of Zhou Ye, a resident of No. 113, Lane 727, Tiantong Road, was suddenly invaded by six robbers who threatened them with guns, forbidding them to make any noise. Just as they were about to search and rob, she went outside and shouted for robbers. The robbers panicked and fled separately. Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Shen Dehui of the British Concession Police Station arrived after hearing the alarm and apprehended Sun A'mao, a native of Jiangbei, who confessed that his accomplices were hiding in the North China Apartment at No. 431 Malan Road. They rushed there and arrested Zhang Zuocheng, Zhang Youliang, and eight others, along with a fake pistol, and took them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court. Judge Jiang Shuzi briefly questioned each of the defendants and ordered them to be detained for further review at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Counterfeit Trademark Fine <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Wu Hua Xiang (Five Fragrance) product factory in Baoyu Lane, Chengdu Road, was founded by the Ningbo-籍 merchant Wang Weikang. Its Wu Hua (Five Flowers) brand musk essence cream is widely sold and has a history of ten years. It was registered with the Trademark Bureau in the 18th year of the Republic of China, prohibiting counterfeiting. It has now been discovered that the Linlin Industrial Company opened by Luo Chengquan at No. 85 Mol坊 Street in the French Concession produces and sells counterfeit Wu Hua brand products in the market. The Wu Hua factory hired lawyer Xu Wufang as a representative to report to the French police, who went to the Linlin Industrial Company and seized more than 200 dozen counterfeit products and more than 1,000 fake trademark papers. Luo Chengquan was escorted to the Second Special District Court for legal action. The Wu Hua factory filed an incidental civil lawsuit to recover losses. Judge Wu Kechou has concluded the trial and recently ruled that the defendant be fined 60 yuan and the seized counterfeit goods be confiscated. The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for trial. The defendant provided a security deposit of 300 yuan. The civil part will also be heard in court soon.</p>

<p>Jin A'zhong, a nine-year-old boy from Ningbo, residing at No. 39, Xiaoham湾, Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, was naturally mischievous. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., he went alone to the sunning platform of a three-story building at No. 5, Lane 104, Pu'en济世 Road, and was playing by leaning on the cement railing. He lost his balance and fell from a height, falling to the cement ground in the adjacent lane, and immediately fainted. Due to the shock to his head, he had continuous bleeding from his ears. He was discovered and his family was notified. His sister, Jin Xuemei, arrived and took him to Guangci Hospital, but he died before he could be treated due to his severe injuries. The hospital reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the Tongren辅元分堂 mortuary for an autopsy, pending a court-appointed examiner.</p>

<p>Recently, various small newspapers in Shanghai have competed to publish obscene content related to morals in order to gain the favor of general lower-level readers and seek to expand their sales. This situation is actually harmful to social morality. The Public Concession Police Authority intends to ban it. The "Shanghai News" at No. 36, Meiren Lane, Hankou Road, continuously published the erotic novel "The Upside-Down Phoenix's Sensual Shadows" on the 8th and 9th of the month. The language inside involved many obscene elements. After being investigated by Chinese Detective Zhang Yi of the Political Department, he reported to the Legal Department. Lawyers Wang Yaotang and Zhang Shizhu, representing the Municipal Council, filed a public prosecution against Kuang Menghuai, the owner of the newspaper, in the First Special District Court under Article 235 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Fang Qinghuan summoned him in the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday morning, the court, believing that severe punishment was necessary to serve as a warning and rectify social morals, sentenced Kuang Menghuai to a fine of 300 yuan for continuously disseminating obscene content, or to replace it with forced labor, calculated at three yuan per day.</p>

To bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, colleagues at the Works Department's comprador office planned to pool funds for a farewell banquet. However, Mr. Pan and his sons, mindful of the plight of displaced refugees, decided to donate the funds for the banquet, along with an equal amount from their own pockets, to the Gonghua Refugee Shelter established by the Chinese staff of the Works Department, allocating it for the education of refugee children. This gesture by Mr. Pan and his sons is truly commendable and worthy of praise.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the population of Shanghai has increased dramatically, and schools in the interior have been destroyed in the war. There are undoubtedly many young people who have lost their access to education and have come to Shanghai. How to relieve these out-of-school students and how to cultivate these promising young people is a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently. Graduates of Jiaotong University who stayed in Shanghai saw this and joined forces to open the Jiaotong Model Summer Remedial School last summer (summer of 1938). More than 300 students came to study, which was very prosperous. Many of those who applied to Jiaotong University and other famous universities in China were admitted and the results were outstanding. Therefore, it was well received. Many people in the community encouraged them to continue to run a permanent school. Mr. Yang Junyi was concerned about education and generously donated the start-up fee of 10,000 yuan. Prominent figures such as Lin Kanghou, Cai Chang, Lian Sheng, Hai Shengtong, etc., served as school directors. Thus, the organizers of the summer school opened the Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School at the intersection of Ximo Road and Jing'an Temple Road. Tang Xianwu served as the principal. All the teachers are outstanding students from previous sessions of Jiaotong University, and most of them are graduates of Nanyang Model Middle School. Naming it Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School has a reason. Lin Kanghou was originally a school director of Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School, and Shen Tongyi was the principal of Nanyang Model Middle School. He has a very deep relationship with Tang Principal and most teachers of Jiaotong Model Primary and Secondary School. Therefore, he has given much support to the school's facilities and planning. The school especially focuses on science, mathematics, and business subjects in order to cultivate talents for research in the science and engineering departments of universities and to train those engaged in banking and public transportation industries. The curriculum is rigorous, classes are held all day, management is meticulous, and the order is well maintained. The classes that have already been opened include the sixth grade of elementary school, all grades of junior high school, and the first and second grades of senior high school. For the past six months, the teaching results have been excellent. It has now been registered in accordance with the law and is planning to expand the school buildings to accommodate more students. With its sound teaching staff, serious teaching, dedicated leadership, and enthusiastic support from the community, its future is undoubtedly limitless. It is heard that there are still vacancies in each grade of the school, and it will hold enrollment during the winter vacation. Those who aspire to study science and engineering in the future and want to lay a good foundation in middle school, this school is truly an ideal middle school. In addition, parents who hope that their children will be engaged in banking and public transportation industries after graduating from middle school can also send their children to apply for the school, because the school's business subjects are very complete, and the teaching of major courses such as Chinese, English, and mathematics in all grades of middle school is particularly insightful and serious.</p>

Mao Weidi, the former Belgian second-group champion, is also a good player, but his backhand stroke is slightly weaker. He and Peterle have a high chance of winning the doubles championship. It was previously said that Xu Chengji, a Chinese Davis Cup tennis player, would participate in the competition, but this did not happen.</p>
<p>This competition uses hard courts and is held at night. The players have to run and fight under the lights. Hong Kong players who are not used to hard courts feel even more inconvenient under these strong lights that cannot shine far.</p>
<p>Philippine players Gavia and Shanzhasi, who had performed in Hong Kong once before, did not receive good reviews, but this time in Saigon, because they are used to hard courts, they got off to a good start and defeated Annan's Geshalu and Chuan E with a score of 8-6, 6-1, 6-1.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Finance: Tianjin Merchants Search and Seize, Cash Prices Surge, Highest Price at 2030 Yuan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash suddenly surged under the influence of strong buying sentiment. The market situation returned to chaos, with prices rising to a peak of 2,030 yuan. This was mainly because foreign exchange was tightening due to the competition among British and American tobacco companies and various oil companies, which strengthened market sentiment. Despite the Ministry of Finance's order to the Silver and Money Trade Association not to prohibit the purchase of gold, those holding spot goods hoarded them. The Tianjin merchants, who had been quiet for a long time, heard that gold prices were high in their area, so they entrusted a certain money exchange business to search and purchase everywhere, with orders exceeding 700 taels. Speculators also actively absorbed gold. At the same time, the bond traders followed suit because of the sharp decline in public bonds. Although the silver shop merchants, money exchange businesses, and cash houses repeatedly tried to lower prices and sell, the supply and demand remained significantly different. As a result, the price ultimately rose by 18 yuan. However, there were slight fluctuations in the middle, but no major waves. Market sentiment was strong and bullish, and transactions were very active, totaling 920 taels. The price of silver jewelry also rose twice. The prices of customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Rose by 18 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of each bar (10 taels) rose slightly in the morning due to the influx of buyers. Initially, a silver shop merchant sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 2,011 yuan, then another silver shop sold 10 taels to a cash house at the same price, and then another 20 taels to another cash house at 12 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange business suddenly made a large purchase on behalf of the Tianjin merchants, and at the same time, bond traders followed suit, so the market price continued to rise. A certain money exchange business bought 100 taels from a silver shop merchant, all at a price of 14 yuan, and a certain customer merchant also bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at the same price. A certain money exchange business then bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 15 yuan, and a bond trader bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 16 yuan. A certain money exchange business bought another 50 taels from a fellow business at 14 yuan. During this time, foreign exchange was tightening due to the competition among British and American tobacco companies and oil companies, so the market price rose again. A bond trader bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 15 yuan, and the same price was offered by a silver shop merchant selling 50 taels to a money exchange business. Then, a certain money exchange business bought another 50 taels from a fellow business at 16 yuan, and the silver shop merchants traded 20 taels with each other at 18 yuan. Finally, the silver shop merchants traded 50 taels with each other at 20 yuan as the midday closing price. It was reported that after the close, money exchange businesses were trading at 21 yuan. Although there was no foreign exchange market in the afternoon on Wednesday, a certain money exchange business was even more intent on purchasing on behalf of the Tianjin merchants, and sellers were hoarding goods and only willing to supply at higher prices, so the price rose sharply. Initially, a certain money exchange business bought 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 23 yuan, then another 50 taels from a silver shop merchant at 25 yuan, and then 100 taels from a fellow business at 27 yuan. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels with each other at 30 yuan as the highest price. After that, because a certain money exchange business stopped absorbing, and silver shop merchants took the opportunity to sell at high prices, the price fell slightly. A silver shop merchant sold 30 taels to a money exchange business at 27 yuan, and the silver shop merchants traded 50 taels with each other at 26 yuan. Finally, a gold house sold 50 taels to a silver shop merchant at 2,027 yuan as the evening closing price, which was up 18 yuan from the previous day. It was heard that someone was selling at 25 yuan after the close, but because buyers had no appetite, no transactions were made. (A range of 19 yuan for the whole day.) The listed price of gold at the cash house was 2,035 yuan for selling and 1,020 yuan for buying, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Prices Increased Twice</p>
<p>The initial selling prices of silver jewelry in silver shops did not change. However, around 11:50 AM, as the cash price approached 2,020 yuan, the price was increased by one yuan. Later, after the cash price rose to a peak of 30 yuan, the price was increased by another yuan. Da Tong Heng and Lao Qing Yun all listed 206 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng listed 204 yuan, buying in at 198 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Unchanged for Two Days</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 24th, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 8.5d per ounce. The Shanghai Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also remained unchanged at 1,213.9 yuan. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 9 li. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also remained unchanged at 1,209.2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">As the Lunar New Year Approaches, Copper Coins are Hoarded: Signs were Already Seen Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Every year as the Lunar New Year approaches, the exchange rate of copper coins is inevitably manipulated, creating a phenomenon of a very short exchange rate, which gradually returns to normal after the Lunar New Year. Since the implementation of the one-cent legal tender, this trend has been somewhat curbed. Unexpectedly, signs of this have been seen recently. This is because a large number of old copper coins have been purchased by money houses and transferred to the Japanese to manufacture munitions. The number of old copper coins on the market has suddenly decreased, and the copper coins that are available also contain more lead impurities. As a result, the exchange rate of copper coins, which could previously be 3,000 coins or more, has become 3,000 coins per Customs tael. Yesterday, many tobacco and exchange shops in the Western District went to exchange copper coins at 10 AM, but they were all rejected. They were given five-yuan banknotes and were only allowed to exchange five one-yuan banknotes. Most stores had no copper coins to exchange and only had signs saying "Exchange at 9 jiao 9 fen for legal tender". Later, some exchanges started, with exchange rates of 2,940, 2,950, or 2,970, while some still only exchanged for jiao coins. How this will evolve remains to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Dalian Gold Price Rises, Foreign Currencies Also Rise <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies fell by 125. The settlement of foreign exchange at foreign exchange banks was very active, and the supply of foreign telegrams was not smooth, so the market price gradually decreased and tended to weaken. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The cash price rose sharply again due to the weakness of the foreign exchange market. Tianjin merchants frequently searched and purchased, and although retail investors sold for profit, it was difficult to satisfy the demand. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price in Dalian was more expensive than in Shanghai, and those who had previously sold had to buy back, so market sentiment was boosted, and everyone rushed to buy. There was no market for foreign exchange bills in the afternoon, and ordinary transactions were rare. After this news spread, the market soared, and sellers were hard to find. The market price was unusually firm. Due to the weakness of foreign exchange and the sharp rise in cash prices, foreign currencies rose sharply. Retail transactions were not active, and transactions in the association were extremely rare. Only Chengtai sold US dollar notes worth 1,000 yuan, which were purchased by Litong. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 jiao, British gold notes rose by 1 jiao 8 fen, US dollar notes rose by 4 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 1 fen 5 li, French franc notes rose by 1 li, Singapore and Dutch notes each rose by 3 fen, Robbie and Canadian notes each rose by 2 fen, and Philippine notes rose by 1 fen. Only Annan, Italian, German gold, Australian gold, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Discount Rate Remains Fixed <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills remained unchanged. The discount rate per thousand yuan remained above 35 yuan, and the final price was 35 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, which was still similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Long-Term Silver Prices Rise <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 24th, speculators bought and sold, and those who bought were satisfied, so transactions were limited, and the market was stable. After the close, the market was slightly dull, but a few sold at the listed price. The near-term price of large silver bars rose by 0.0625, and the long-term price rose by 0.125. According to a New York silver telegram, the price of American silver remained fixed. According to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, and spot prices rose by 1 anna, while near-term and long-term prices did not change.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Securities: Market Sentiment Weak, Domestic Bonds Plummet, Foreign Bonds Stable <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The black market for securities suddenly experienced an unexpected decline yesterday. The severity of the process was not as dramatic as on the 16th of this month, but the lowest price broke the minimum price of the 16th. Rumors arose in the market, with various and unverified reports. Because of the unfavorable environment, rumors took advantage of the situation. Some said that there were new reforms to the interest rate issue, but this was just speculation, and it was unlikely that the orders would change so frequently. Others said that public bonds were sold to buy cotton yarn, but the scope should not have been so large. The most plausible reason was that on the 10th, a certain bank sold a large number of bonds, which were said to be spot goods with expiring coupons. This caused extreme panic among retail investors. However, this was only a temporary phenomenon. Observing the environment, after the initial determination of this new reform, the situation in Europe suddenly became urgent, and there was a sense of impending crisis. In the face of this turbulent situation, public bonds, even if they rebounded, would have difficulty stabilizing. Yesterday, the opening prices were slightly lower by half a yuan. Because the 10th was selling, retail investors followed suit, and the decline could not be stopped. De Fu Hao also had a considerable sell-off, and the selling sentiment seemed to be unstoppable. In the afternoon, the selling sentiment of the 10th was indeed active, and the market was filled with selling sounds. The decline was even more severe, falling by about 1.5 yuan, and the lowest price of this month was discovered. Near the close, the selling by the 10th subsided slightly, and a certain large investor took advantage of the low prices to absorb, so the price rebounded by several jiao to about 1 yuan. The future situation is still difficult to be optimistic about. Whether the 10th has sold out its spot goods and whether it can arouse the interest of the general public to buy more are still in doubt. As a result, the price continued to fall by 1.35 yuan to 1.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be over 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading was as dull as usual. There were many inquiries but few successful transactions. Only a few dozen shares of Ning Shao Company stock were traded at a price of 8 yuan 05 fen, which was slightly better than before by 1 jiao 2 jiao.</p>
<p>The listed prices of London Chinese foreign bonds on the 24th of this month (Tuesday) were stable and unchanged, but they were still in a state of having prices but no market. British merchants were still inquiring about the supply and demand of physical goods. A total of 3,000 pounds of British Boxer Indemnity Bonds were sold at a price of 50 pounds, which was 0.5 pounds higher than the market price. Another 2,000 pounds were sold at a price of 49 pounds 15 shillings, which was 5 shillings higher than the market price. Buyers also had an appetite for 2,000 to 5,000 pounds of this bond, but the price would depend on the seller's offer. 2,000 to 5,000 pounds of French bonds with prints were sold at a price of 47 pounds, which was 15 shillings higher than last week. 2,000 to 5,000 pounds of German bonds with prints were sold at a price of 45 pounds 5 shillings, which was 5 shillings lower than the previous day. 5,000 pounds of Sino-French-American 5% Gold Bonds with prints (i.e., 25,000 US dollars) were sold at a price of 69 pounds 5 shillings. Another 10,000 US dollars (i.e., 2,000 British pounds) were sold at a price of 65 US dollars 37.5 cents, or 69 British pounds 15 shillings, which was 5 shillings to 15 shillings higher than the market price. There were also 2,000 pounds of Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds originally issued at a price of 17 pounds, which was 1 pound higher than the market price. Another 3,500 pounds of continued issuance of German bonds with prints were sold at a price of 16 pounds 15 shillings, which was 15 shillings higher than the market price. 2,000 pounds of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bond were sold at a price of 18 pounds 15 shillings, which was 5 shillings higher than the market price, but slightly lower than the previous day by 5 shillings.</p>
<p>The listed prices of London British Far East company stocks on the 24th of this month (Tuesday) were generally stable. Only the price of the Kulake Langban Rubber stock fell by 2 shillings 6 pence to 17 shillings 6 pence. Also, the previous report that the price of the Kailan Mining Administration stock fell by 6 pence was an error of falling by 3 pence. The market price should be 16 shillings 6 pence. We hereby make a correction.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Active Settlements, Tight Foreign Exchange <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was characterized by active settlements by companies such as Mobil Oil and British American Tobacco, combined with a weak desire to sell by banks and a strong desire to buy, which led to a gradually tightening trend. Although cotton yarn merchants came to sell in the middle, it had no impact.</p>
<p>In the morning, the London silver price rose both near-term and long-term, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London gold price also did not rise or fall. The exchange rate of British to American currencies fell by 1.2 li, to French currency fell by 13 centimes, and to Shanghai currency was flat. The exchange rate of American to British currencies fell by 0.125, to French currency remained unchanged, and to Shanghai currency fell slightly by 1 fen. The central listing of various exchange rates remained fixed. The early selling price of banks was 8 pence 40625 for British currency and 16 yuan 34375 for American currency, which was flat compared to the previous closing for British currency and slightly tighter by 0.03125 for American currency. After the opening, money exchange businesses sold American currency to Holland-China Banking Corporation at 16 yuan 4375, and cotton yarn merchants also sold American currency to American banks at 16 yuan 375, so the situation was still stable. The HSBC listing was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to rise by 0.25. Afterwards, cotton yarn merchants sold American currency to Chase Bank and Holland-China Banking Corporation at 16 yuan 3125. Later, Mobil Oil and other companies made settlements, and a certain foreign company settled with Mercantile Bank and HSBC at 8 pence 375 for spot pounds. Then British American Tobacco settled with Mercantile Bank at only 8 pence 328125. Later, Mobil Oil purchased from Bank of America, Chase, Holland and British Bank at only 8 pence 28125, so the process was quite tight. Finally, money exchange businesses sold Hong Kong currency to China and Italy Bank and Holland Bank at 56 yuan 375 and 56.5 yuan, so the trend gradually stabilized. Money exchange businesses sold American dollar notes at 16 yuan 4375. The midday closing selling price of banks was 8 pence 359375 for British currency and 16 yuan 28125 for American currency. As a result, compared to the previous closing, British currency fell by 0.046875 and American currency tightened by 0.09375, and Hong Kong currency tightened by 0.375. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Yarn and Flowers: The Financial World Hoards Profits, Cotton Yarn Market Exceptionally Tight, Domestic Demand Still Exists, But Lacks Funds to Procure Goods <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains firm and stable, with a slow upward trend. Speculation among financial circles is increasingly fervent, with outsiders also entering the market to absorb supplies, leading to market firmness. However, there is no sign of genuine demand development, mainly because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and there is usually a period of tightening in credit, with no intention of procuring goods. Only Yunnan merchants show a strong appetite for coarse yarn. According to surveys, various merchant groups report that domestic cotton yarn demand still exists. The biggest reason is that banks are not allowing full remittances, leading to a lack of funds for procurement. Merchants are unable to purchase goods and must wait for local products to be sold for cash flow. Consequently, there is a general bullish sentiment, with buyers rushing in, but actual consumption remains poor. The market is rising, but not dramatically, and any slight wind will cause a setback, though the price will eventually rebound. 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has reached 406 yuan, surpassing the previous peak on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Looking at the spot yarn market today, trading was brisk at the opening due to continuous purchases of Shuang Ma paper receipts by certain firms the previous afternoon. The opening price for Shuang Ma spot was raised by two yuan to 406 yuan, with 70 bales traded among peers. Shortly after, banks entered the market to buy 100-200 bales of paper receipts at 400 yuan. However, subsequent sales to customers were not smooth, and Guangdong merchants slightly reduced their holdings of Shuang Ma spot, causing the price to fall by one yuan to 405 yuan, but the market remained strong. Total morning transactions amounted to 1,305 bales, with 20-count Shuang Ma up two yuan, Tian Nv up two and a half yuan, Te Jin Cheng up two and a half yuan, Shuang Di Qiu up two and a half yuan, Mu Yang up one yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn Hong Shuang Ma up four yuan due to strong demand from Yunnan merchants. Bao Yi rose six yuan. The factory New Yu opened sales of 200 bales of 10-count Shuang Di Qiu at 300 yuan, purchased by Yunnan merchants. Today, 110 bales were exported to Shantou and 440 bales to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Japanese yarn market, spot yarn business, although frequent and average, the market price gradually upward, covering the Japanese plant for forward cargo quotation are not willing to open for sale, so people raised, 20-count Shui Yue spot yarn price of 318 yuan, this month 317 yuan, next month 320 yuan, 20-count Lan Feng spot yarn price of 313.5 yuan, this month 313 yuan, next month 317 yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Why is Yarn Price Rising? Read This Paragraph First <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of cotton yarn has been progressing daily. Since the beginning of the "Red Plate" this year, it has been rising steadily in less than a month. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has risen by 47 yuan compared to the price at the end of last year, and the upward trend is slow and steady. How can the market be so consolidated? There are still reasons for this, which will be briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) The recent war situation is smooth, and the domestic demand for cotton yarn and cotton cloth is still maintainable.</p>
<p>(2) Since the securities market has been fluctuating, the general financial wealthy have released public bonds and invested in cotton yarn. Therefore, although actual sales are not smooth, the stock of spot goods is very scarce.</p>
<p>(3) The futures market for yarn and cloth trading has been closed since the "August 13" War of Resistance. Most brokers are idle. Some of them, realizing that sitting and eating will not work in the long run, have changed their business and entered the spot market. Their goal is naturally only to buy, with no intention of selling. As a result, the stock of spot goods is even tighter. Moreover, Shao and Bian have been silent for a long time and are now very active in the spot yarn market, buying a lot of yarn and opening forward positions for thousands of bales, which shows their strong bullish view.</p>
<p>(4) Since cotton has been subjected to unified control by the "Japanese puppet" regime, exports from the north are prohibited, and the source is cut off. The stock around the suburbs is dwindling day by day, and the market price is rising sharply. The price of coarse cotton is reaching new highs, which has aroused the speculation of speculators, financial circles, and nervous people, and the desire to collect is spontaneously generated. Therefore, the market often hears that a certain yarn merchant is entrusted by a certain bank to buy hundreds of bales of Shuang Ma at a premium of several yuan. As a result, the market becomes increasingly tight, and the price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has reached 406 yuan, surpassing the high price of 403 yuan on the 10th of this month. According to market discussions, most opinions are that there is no way to deal with raw materials, and the future will remain stable. Fortunately, the pricing of Indian cotton is not only not rising but falling, because there is talk of the US government selling its cotton reserves, and the market price remains weak. The unstable European situation and the decline in world consumption are the biggest reasons for the pressure on the price of American cotton. According to surveys, the stock of spot yarn in yarn and cloth warehouses has reached 20,000 bales. This cargo is all deposited by hoarders who have paid advances, waiting for a good price to sell.

<h3 id="e127">Yao Cotton Source Blocked <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Local cotton business is becoming more and more depressed, and the factory is completely in a state of stagnation. Although the trade has a demand, but the package feet are very fresh, are to offset the factory's transaction. The selling price is still as stable as usual. The stock of cotton in the vicinity of the four suburbs is dwindling, so the source is declining. The factory, in view of the above situation, have purchased and ordered foreign cotton to supplement, the amount of Indian cotton procured by Chinese factories has been increasing in recent days, the local cotton transactions, all of which have been seized by them almost all of them. The cotton in the Subei area is still good, and it is reported that the Yao flower Zhejiang authorities have ordered that it should not be exported, and the source has been blocked recently. 1,923 bales of Tong Hua have arrived on the wharf, and the opening price is unknown. Another 310 pieces from Beisha, the current cotton transaction volume and market conditions are listed on the left:</p>
<h3 id="e128">One Hundred Months! Fifty Months! Unexpectedly wartime bonuses are so generous. It's all about creating opportunities to love national products. One year of earnings equals nine years and four months. <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The market price of 20-count cotton yarn was 263 yuan in December of the year before last (1937). By March of last year, it had exceeded the 300 yuan mark. Subsequently, it gradually rose until October, when this newspaper resumed publication. The price reached a peak of 515 yuan, an increase of more than 250 yuan per bale in less than a year. Such an increase has probably never been seen before. As a result, all yarn mills made a fortune in 1938. At the end of the year, a certain yarn mill distributed bonuses equivalent to 100 months' salary to all employees, regardless of their position. Another yarn mill distributed bonuses equivalent to 50 months' salary to its employees. Some people thought this was not true and suspected that the news was exaggerated. In fact, all the news in this newspaper is based on facts. For example, the news about "Silver and Money Industries Making a Fortune" that was published the other day was later verified by the "Zi Lin Daily" through interviews with certain banks. Although the banks were evasive and seemed to think that the statement was too high, the fact is that some banks had profits of tens of millions, and others had profits of millions. This newspaper does not want to publish their names to avoid unnecessary trouble. Fortunately, this kind of news is beneficial to these industries and increases their credibility. However, some yarn mills in the occupied areas would rather be destroyed than surrender and suffer considerable losses, while others are half-hearted and content with temporary pleasure.</p>

<p>Yesterday, spot flour sales suddenly decreased because it was rumored that Tianjin merchants are continuing to order large quantities of foreign flour, estimated at more than 300,000 bags, with the price set at $4.67, for delivery at the end of March. Moreover, previously ordered flour also began to arrive in early last week, so Tianjin flour sales have turned sluggish, and other northern merchants are also watching and not taking action. After continuous purchases by the Nanyang merchants in recent days, their appetite seems to be satisfied. As a result, the total city transaction was less than 20,000 bags, with half of it purchased by our local merchants. No. 2 flour is still priced at $4.80, while the next grade of flour is difficult to deliver. Today, 3,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Certain Foreign Firm is Procuring 60,000 Bags of Low-Grade Rice in the Songjiang and Sijing Areas, Suffered from Water Damage in Transit, Merchants Must Compensate, Domestic Merchants are Stepping Back to Avoid <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Although the source of domestic rice has not been weak in recent days, it is heard that in the Songjiang and Sijing areas, a certain foreign firm is going to procure 60,000 bags of low-grade rice. Once the foreign firm takes action, the local area will be sealed off, prohibiting other merchants from shipping. This action not only affects the source of supply in this port, but the goods procured by the foreign firm must have a special mark printed on the rice bags. If they are damaged by rain during transit, the foreign firm will demand unreasonable compensation from the merchants, causing domestic merchants to be fearful and avoiding the area. Yesterday's arrivals were fewer than before, only three barges arriving downstream, with about 7,000 bags of "wheel bun" rice. The seller's intention is very firm, but because the sales of the local street and hoarders are still sluggish, the situation is still soft. Thick and thin japonica rice has little change, and the same is true for Du Yang and Du Jian rice. However, glutinous rice is scarce and fragrant, and the market is still brisk. Although the price of high-quality goods has not risen yet, the price of mid-quality goods has risen slightly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source of wheat continued to be scarce. About 3,000 bags of new wheat arrived from the Yangtze River area. The sellers believe that the production price has not loosened and the costs are high, so they are unwilling to sell cheaply. However, the factories are still relying on foreign wheat supplies and are slackening their demand for domestic wheat. As a result, the two sides are deadlocked, and only a total of 4,500 bags of wheat from Jiangbei, Chuzhou, and Wuhu were traded, with 3,000 bags purchased by the Fuxin Factory and 1,500 bags purchased by the Fufeng Factory. The highest price was still $6.50.</p>

<p>Since the opening price of new domestic Diao Qing was 13.1 yuan, there has been no subsequent arrival. It is more cost-effective to ship directly from the producing area to Wenzhou and Haimen for sale, so the procurement price suddenly rose. According to Longxi's telegram yesterday, the price has risen by 2 yuan. Therefore, it is foreseeable that there will not be much future goods. Yesterday, the Chao merchant opened 76 bags of Chen Gao Huang Gang Qing at 13.5 yuan. New white-wrapped Hainan Red arrived from the Guangdong merchant and was priced at 12.4 yuan. More than 50 bags of Da Gong rice flour from the Fujian merchant were opened at 22.5 yuan, an increase of 0.3 yuan. The trend of foreign sugar is stable. The association set the price of 24 Dutch coarse white at 25 yuan for spot goods and 16.8 yuan for transit goods. The price of Tai Koo Sugar B mark has not changed. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Ningbo.</p>

<p>Lily bulb slices have recently been sold out in the producing areas, leading to a cut in the source of supply. The stock of goods in the hands of local merchants is also dwindling due to continuous purchases from Hong Kong merchants, so the trend is tight.

<h3 id="e135">Old Sayings About Furs <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Dehui</p>
<p>China is a major producer of furs, so many people wear furs. In ancient times, there were restrictions on wearing furs. For example, fox fur could not be lightly used by people without status. According to research, there were "Emperor Yao wearing deer fur in winter," "King Wen of Zhou wearing blue phoenix feather fur," "Emperor Wu of Han wearing Western Region auspicious clothes fur," and "Emperor Jingzong of Tang wearing Nanchang floating light fur." These were the general instances of heads of state wearing fur. The fur worn by officials included Yanzi's deer fur clothing, Lu Xun's fox fur clothing, and Zhang Zongchang's fur collected by Empress Wu Zetian. As for the fur worn by famous scholars, there was "Wang Gong sitting in a high hall in high spirits, wearing crane fur." and "Yan Guang, living in seclusion in Tongjiang, fishing and wearing sheepskin." Although there is research, it is not limited to these few people, but the above examples already include heads of state, officials, and famous scholars, which can represent a glimpse of fur clothing in ancient times.</p>
<p>Confucius, the great sage and teacher, is known to everyone as a sage. He not only liked to wear fur but also had artistic designs. This is recorded in the "Analects of Confucius" section on "Village Parties": "He wore black clothes with lambskin fur, white clothes with fox fur, and yellow clothes with fox fur. He wore a long casual fur coat, with the right sleeve shortened." In these few words, how to prepare and design the fur is taken care of in every aspect. Because it was lambskin fur, it was matched with black clothes; fox fur was matched with white clothes; and fox fur was matched with yellow clothes. Isn't this Confucius's artistic design? Moreover, in order to keep warm and comfortable, he often wore a longer casual coat, and in order to make work more convenient, he shortened the right sleeve slightly, showing that Confucius greatly advocated the wearing of fur.</p>
<h3 id="e136">West Port Leather and North Port Leather <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zhengyan</p>
<p>The production area of West Port leather is limited to the Northwest, generally not exceeding the provinces of Qinghai, Xikang, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia; while the North Port leather is limited to the production of Mongolia and Northeast and North China; that is, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong.</p>
<p>The most famous producing areas of West Port leather are Qinghai and Xikang provinces, which produce lynx, sheep, mountain dogs (cat leopards), West foxes, grass foxes, musk deer, civets, sika deer, wolves, marmots, Tibetan gazelles, big-headed sheep, tigers, and wild horses. Among them, lynx, West foxes, and marmots are the most valuable, while grass foxes, civets, and musk deer are next, and sheep, mountain dogs, wolves, Tibetan gazelles, and big-headed sheep are second. Although sika deer and tiger skins are both valuable leather goods, they belong to decorative items. Gansu and Ningxia produce the most big-headed sheep, sheep, Tibetan gazelles, mountain rats, and wolves, especially in Ejina, Alxa, and the Helan Mountains and Liupan Mountains areas. The total annual output is no less than Qinghai and Xikang. However, the production of civets, foxes, marmots, and lynx is extremely small. Shaanxi is famous for producing marmots, but the quality is not as good as Qinghai and Kang, because Shaanxi's climate is much warmer than Qinghai and Kang. Secondly, the production of civets and foxes is relatively small, and there are also many mountain rats.</p>
<p>The more famous producing areas of North Port leather are, of course, the four provinces of Northeast China: Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. In addition to goats, mountain dogs, leopards, wolves, tigers, mountain rats, marmots, civets, foxes, and wild cats, the most valuable product is sable. However, the production of sable in Northeast China is not very high, but in East Mongolia, especially in the Tannu Uriankhai area, it is almost purely famous for the production of this sable. However, because the area is close to Kulun and the Soviet Union, there were very few shipments into the interior in the past due to inconvenient transportation.</p>
<p>Among the four provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong, the provinces that produce the most leather are Hebei and Chahar, especially in eastern Hebei and Guyuan, Duolun, and Chicheng in northern Chahar. The main products are wolves, leopards, mountain dogs, sheep, Tibetan gazelles, wild camels, and mountain rats, while civets, foxes, and marmots are rare.</p>
<p>The largest concentration of China's leather market is in five places: Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Tianjin, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou. Now three of the five places have fallen, and the markets in Xi'an and Zhengzhou are no longer as prosperous as in the past, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Simple Method for Washing Leather Goods <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Feifei</p>
<p>Leather goods are a good product for keeping warm and protecting against the cold in winter. The types are divided into coarse, fine, superior, and inferior, and the prices are naturally different. However, those who own heavy fur coats are originally the wealthy class. Even if they are cheap goods, they must cost at least dozens of yuan, so poor scholars can never become customers in leather goods stores. However, if wearing a leather coat is not about showing off or showing nobility, but only about keeping warm and protecting against the cold, then people with ordinary means can also afford to buy one. Because the high-quality fine products such as fox fur, sable, lynx, otter skin, and gray squirrel spread fur naturally cost dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of gold per piece, how can they be afforded except by those noble people. But the same leather coat is made of ordinary lambskin or black sheepskin, which is also very economical. The better ones cost only about 20 yuan, and the worse ones cost only more than 10 yuan. Friends who are savvy and good at calculating will even go to second-hand clothing stores to buy old goods to modify. If they are careful when wearing them, they can often replace the lining at least three or four times. Although some bad leather pieces will inevitably be cut off later, and some new small leather pieces will be added to supplement them, it is still cost-effective. Therefore, leather goods are still a kind of economical and decent clothing among the general public.</p>
<p>However, you should also understand some knowledge of cleaning leather goods when wearing leather coats, otherwise, half of the person will be damaged, and half of the coat will be damaged. A good thing will definitely be lost due to not knowing how to clean it. Here. I will tell the readers of this magazine the simple leather cleaning method and the method of preserving leather goods for reference.</p>
<p>White lambskin hair is most prone to getting dirty and black, and the luster and smoothness of the hair will also be lost, so you have to wash it after wearing it for a winter or a period of time: However, leather goods are not ordinary clothes after all. If the leather version is damp, it will turn into saltpeter and harden, and a piece of clothing will be finished. Moreover, the dirt on the hair is not easy to wash away; Indeed, how can any item be washed away its dirt without water and soap. Now I have a method that is quite convenient. You only need to expose the leather liner to the sun for a long time, then gently pat off the dust in the hair roots, and then use a soft brush to slowly straighten the hair strands. At that time, use a sprayer to spray a layer of light oil (gasoline or rosin water) on the hair surface. It must be uniform, and at the same time, immediately apply the old powder (buy from the raw material number, one pound of the old powder) evenly on the top (it is better to use English powder or flour), and rub it slowly with your palms, spread it out, wait for it to dry, then brush off the powder, and then pat it with your hands to make it clean. After three times of this, the fur will be white and will not be damaged at all. However, I am afraid that there will be an odor left after washing, so you still need to wash it with light oil again. Because the old powder is prone to flying into the lungs and making people cough, it is best to wear a nose and mouth cover when washing the leather. As for the method of storing leather, it is even easier, but it is best to store it after washing to avoid insects and rot. Other methods such as sun-drying the leather, placing camphor, and storing it in a camphor wood box are naturally also methods to avoid insects; However, camphor on the leather will also be destroyed, so before storing, you should apply camphor powder on the sun-dried leather goods after it is cool, and then brush off the powder, leaving only its aroma. When packing, use a hundred-part water to wash the box again, and hide a package of camphor powder in each corner of the box, then it will be foolproof.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Let's Promote Leather Goods <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Bow and Arrow</p>
<p>There are generally two kinds of clothing materials for keeping out the cold in winter: leather goods and wool. However, both of these clothing materials are made of the fur of animals. Therefore, wool is also known as woolen fabrics. Here I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will promote leather goods and not buy wool. There are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>Wool is mostly imported, while leather goods are mostly domestic products. Although there are a few woolen mills in China now, the output is too small. If everyone buys it, the amount produced by Chinese manufacturers will not be enough to supply. We only need to look at the various wools displayed on the market, and it can almost be said that none of them are foreign goods. As for leather goods, except for a very small number of uncommon varieties, the rest, whether ordinary, high-quality, or practical, are all domestic products. Therefore, fellow countrymen who love national products, it is more reliable to buy leather goods than to buy wool.</p>
<p>Wool is made from animal hair after a step of spinning and weaving. It has become an extremely fine material, and its ability to maintain body temperature is naturally not as great as that of leather goods. Leather goods are made of natural animal skins, and the fluffy hair can preserve the original temperature; Moreover, if leather goods are stored properly, they will last much longer than the relatively easy-to-moth wools. So from these points of view, we should promote leather goods.</p>
<p>Here I would like to introduce a reliable leather goods store, Tian Fa Xiang Leather Goods Bureau, which has a long history and a solid reputation among the general public. As the Spring Festival is approaching, everyone wants to add new clothes, and you can take advantage of the fact that the bureau is currently offering its last amazing price, so you can visit and see the products.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Concerning Fur Coats <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Fur coats are indeed worth promoting. Once winter arrives, whether you wear Chinese or Western clothing, both have their drawbacks. Those who wear Western clothing find it too cold in winter and switch to Chinese attire. However, since they usually don't own Chinese garments, they have to have everything from inner shirts to padded jackets newly made. Moreover, in addition to a fur coat, they also need to have an overcoat made. Some people, due to social obligations, cannot do without both Chinese and Western clothing, so they not only need to make a Chinese-style overcoat but also a Western-style overcoat. For the sake of both Chinese and Western outfits, one has to acquire quite a few clothes to get through a winter, naturally incurring a significant expense.</p>
<p>Therefore, I once advocated adopting a fur coat that could be used for both Chinese and Western attire, which would remedy this shortcoming. The style of the fur coat I'm referring to could be Western, but longer than the Western-style overcoats currently in fashion. That way, if you want to wear Chinese clothing, you can simply pair it with a lined robe or a velvet robe; if you wear Western clothing, you can put it on over it. Not only can it be used for both, but it can also prevent you from feeling your legs are too cold when wearing a Western-style overcoat outdoors because it is too short. Even when wearing Chinese clothing, since the inner garments are thinner, you won't feel too heavy.</p>
<p>The so-called fur coat uses silk or woolen fabric as the outer layer and fur as the lining, making it warmer than ordinary overcoats. And as we all know, fur is very durable. High-quality furs can last through three to five outer layers, or even be passed down through generations. A father's fur coat can be taken apart by his son and remade. Therefore, a fur coat can last at least ten or eight years. At most, the outer layer might wear out and be replaced, but the lining doesn't need to be replaced. In this regard, it is also more economical than using satin or camel hair for the lining.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can easily see that fur coats have many advantages, especially their durability, economy, practicality, and the necessity of promoting them. If fur stores could pay attention to this and hire someone to design and manufacture a convenient and stylish fur coat for both Chinese and Western use, making the public aware of its advantages and adopting it, it would not only help people economize on winter clothing but also promote the fur business!</p>
<h3 id="e140">Sable Fur <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Tiansun</p>
<p>A sable fur coat is indeed a family heirloom of the Hua family of Sansheng. Although Hua Sansheng is named Sansheng, he cannot reflect on himself three times a day like the ancient sages, but instead is immersed in a drunken stupor day and night; he feels like he cannot live a day without drinking. As long as he has wine to drink, he is willing to die drunk, possessing the courage of Liu Ling, who said, "When I die, just bury me!"</p>
<p>The Hua family is not a wealthy family, but his great-grandfather served as a high official in the Qing Dynasty for several years. His political achievements were quite good, so the emperor awarded him a sable fur coat. The old man was moved to tears, considering it the greatest honor of his life; therefore, when he reached the age of eighty, he summoned his family to take out the sable fur coat from the gilded chest and solemnly handed it to his son, trembling as he said, "My son, this is the only treasure your father has in his life. The emperor's deep kindness is all entrusted to this. You must treasure it well and pass it down from generation to generation, so that future generations will know that their ancestors were not useless. No matter how poor you become, you must not consider using this sable fur coat. Only on New Year's Day or when the country has grand celebrations is the head of the family allowed to wear it once; at other times, it must be stored in the gilded chest. Take it out to air it out in the heat of June, and never forget it. Put in plenty of mothballs to prevent moths. If you don't listen to me and something happens to this treasure, even if my spirit is gone, I will turn into a vengeful ghost to punish you. This is my only dying wish, I have nothing else to say."</p>
<p>Sansheng's grandfather was able to abide by his father's will, treasuring the sable fur coat throughout his life. Not only did he not dare to wear it on New Year's Day, but he also didn't dare to wear it even when the country had grand celebrations; except for airing it out for three days during the hottest days of summer, it was locked away in the gilded chest year-round, like a prisoner serving a sentence. When he was dying, he also told his son his father's last words, saying that this was the family heirloom and that you must protect it with your life, otherwise you would be unfilial and rebellious.</p>
<p>By the time the Hua family passed down to Sansheng's father, they had declined. The poor scholar could not carry or lift, and had no other skills, so he opened a Confucian shop and lived a life of sitting on a cold bench. One year, on New Year's Eve, he really couldn't get through the terrible end of the year; he repeatedly opened the gilded chest, staring blankly at the sable fur coat, wanting to send it to a pawnshop to exchange for some money to relieve the emergency, but when he reached out to touch the soft sable fur, he suddenly recoiled as if shocked by electricity, as if he heard his father's voice roaring in his ear, and as if he saw the ghost of his grandfather appearing before him. Finally, he sighed deeply, closed the gilded chest again, and used his silver tongue to plead with several close relatives, barely managing to borrow some money to scrape through the New Year. Pitifully, he worried about poverty every year, and died of worry and poverty before the age of sixty. Of course, when he died, he also told Sansheng his grandfather and father's last words, telling Sansheng to treasure the sable fur coat as he himself had, even if he worried and died of poverty. He was a very meticulous person, and fearing that Sansheng was unreliable, he specifically instructed his daughter-in-law to also bear half the responsibility for treasuring it. Sansheng's wife, with tears in her eyes, agreed in one breath.</p>
<p>Sansheng was a scholarly child with a good education, but he was too much of a celebrity and did not engage in household production. The one thing he always adhered to was Li Bai's saying that "nothing is better than a cup in hand," and he didn't care about anything as long as he had a cup in hand. Usually, he could earn some money with his pen, but in the blink of an eye, it would turn into yellow soup poured into his intestines. His wife was a very virtuous woman, and she often bitterly persuaded him not to love wine like his life, torturing his body. However, he cited the teachings of the wine ancestor Liu Ling to resist her, saying, "The words of women are the least to be listened to."</p>
<p>Sansheng's alcohol consumption grew day by day, while the money in his pocket dwindled day by day. Because almost every one of the 365 days of the year was spent drunk as mud, how could he write anything? If he didn't write, naturally there would be no income. His wife had no way to think, and washed her face with tears every day, while diligently doing chores, earning some money to maintain their lives, and also having to buy some wine for Sansheng in addition to the seven necessities of life. Sansheng complained that she bought too little, not enough to satisfy his addiction, and often argued with her endlessly. One day, while she was out buying firewood and rice, he broke the lock on the gilded chest and stole the family heirloom, the sable fur coat, and pawned it for one hundred dollars, living the life he wanted in his drunken stupor with his band of drinking buddies.</p>
<p>When his wife returned and saw the gilded chest open and the sable fur coat gone, she cried bitterly for a long time, but there was nothing she could do. When Sansheng returned drunk in the middle of the night, she finally managed to find the pawn ticket in his pocket, secretly put it away, and from then on, she had to work two days' worth of work every day, not daring to relax at all. After a full year of hard work, she finally earned an extra hundred dollars, secretly redeemed the sable fur coat without her husband's knowledge, and treasured it in a broken box; she was very happy in her heart, seeing this family heirloom return to the Hua family's door, and that night she had a dream in which the three generations of Hua ancestors came to thank her.</p>
<p>The devastating war broke out, and the hometown of Hua Sansheng and his wife could not escape the catastrophe. One day, Sansheng was buying drinks in a tavern when a team of silver-gray iron birds flew by and dropped several bombs, destroying the tavern and the surrounding houses. Sansheng's wife received the bad news and cried so hard she almost died. She finally managed to find Sansheng's incomplete body in the rubble and hastily buried it in the ancestral tomb; then she packed the sable fur coat in a bundle, tied it to her back with a rope, and traveled dozens of miles overnight to a rear hospital to work as a nurse, engaging in relief work. She thought that Sansheng had no descendants, so what was the point of guarding this family heirloom? She asked someone to take it to the city, sold it for several hundred dollars, and donated it all to the country, exchanging it for many winter clothes for the soldiers on the front lines. Her heart suddenly felt relieved. That night, she had another dream in which the three generations of Hua ancestors were all smiling—smiling sweetly.</p>

<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Former British Foreign Secretary Eden is a person who loves clothing the most. The clothes he wears, even a handkerchief, are modern. He has never used outdated materials, colors, or styles of clothing: Moreover, the clothes he wears are neat and crisp. Besides wearing dinner suits, he changes at least three sets of casual wear every day, and even his shirts and socks must be changed from time to time.</p>
<p>One New Year's, because he was going to attend a grand banquet in diplomatic circles, he specially designed and patterned the dress himself, and asked a tailor to specially make a dress. The style was generous, and the color was elegant, invisibly increasing his solemn and lofty demeanor. Therefore, many great figures in diplomatic circles have successively imitated it, and even called such clothes "Eden Style," even the top hat is "Eden Style." Nowadays, London is still very popular with this Eden-style hat.</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone made a statistic on the number of his clothes. It is said that if he changed a set of clothes every three hours in his wardrobe, then the clothes he wore in eight months would not have the same style and color. This is also a rare piece of news about clothes, right?</p>
<p>Hearing this kind of rare news about clothes, of course, we don't need to say that he is extravagant in a poor or jealous tone, because he has no other hobbies, and the money he earns can be spent on clothes, not to mention that he has strong productivity, not to mention that he is still a rich man! If we have his intelligence, courage, loyalty, and greatness, we may not be able to wear so many clothes!</p>

<p>— He Lisan</p>
<p>At this time of winter storage, it is the season for health practitioners to "supplement in time": However, supplementation has the distinction between "medicine supplementation" and "food supplementation", and there is a folk saying that "medicine supplementation is not as good as food supplementation": It is true that food supplementation is more affordable, as it can satisfy the appetite and also benefit the body. The following are some examples of food supplements:</p>
<p>Cordyceps Duck: Take a large duck, cut it open and wash it clean. First, boil it once with water to remove the foam, add aged wine, salt, Southern ham, winter bamboo shoots, and other ingredients, then add some Cordyceps sinensis and wolfberry. Place it in a crock and simmer gently until it is tender. It is a medicinal supplement in food supplement, its taste is light and fresh, without any medicinal taste, and it has the effect of greatly supplementing the lungs and kidneys.</p>
<p>Yin Yang Paste: Cut mutton into pieces, first boil to remove the foam, then cook until half tender, add an appropriate amount of aged wine, rock sugar, and soy sauce. Then mix in soaked sea cucumber and simmer slowly until tender. Mutton helps Yang, and sea cucumber nourishes Yin. Yin and Yang are both supplemented, so it is also called "Yin Yang Paste".</p>
<p>Fresh Beef Juice: Cut several taels of beef into small pieces and place in a special earthenware pot. (Available at pharmacies.) Add a little salt and simmer in water. After two or three hours, fresh beef juice will be formed, and its supplementary effect is quite significant.</p>
<p>Fresh Chicken Juice: Take a large hen, cut it open and wash it clean, then place it in a large bowl and steam it in a pot until cooked through. Take out the yellow chicken juice, add a little salt and eat it. Its taste is delicious, and its supplementary power is also extremely strong. If you use a young hen, you can chop it up and put it in an earthenware pot to stew.</p>
<p>Mutton Porridge: Add white mutton to hot porridge. It is most suitable for those with Yang deficiency.</p>
<p>Eight Treasure Porridge: Cook glutinous rice porridge with chestnuts, lotus seeds, gorgon fruit, red dates, etc. Add rock sugar, called "Eight Treasure Porridge", which can nourish the five internal organs.</p>
<p>Egg Milk: Beat an egg thoroughly and pour in boiled milk, which has a great supplementary effect.</p>
<p>Egg Soy Milk: Beat an egg thoroughly and pour in hot tofu milk, its effect is no less than chicken.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Pork and fish each have their own characteristics. Cooking them separately certainly has its own flavor, but when cooked together, the pork has the flavor of fish inside, and the fish has the flavor of meat inside, which is even more wonderful. For example, cuttlefish, braised alone, or stewed and mixed with sauce sesame oil, are very good snacks for drinking; if after the cuttlefish is braised or stewed, add some small pieces of pork inside, add soy sauce and bamboo shoot slices, and braise together, the taste is very rich, and it is refreshing to eat with rice. In addition to cuttlefish, there is also a type of light dried fish (said to be dried marinated yellow croaker), which is also most suitable for braising with pork. Sugar and soy sauce must be added a lot to make it flavorful. It is more refreshing to eat with rice than braised cuttlefish with pork. Both of these are added to this week's menu.</p>

<p>— Refugee</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the two feet seem to have lost their effectiveness, because there are means of transportation——cars, trams, rickshaws, traveling in all directions, even a distance of two or three miles, only costs three cents, and it takes only five minutes, which saves energy and time. Of course, it is what people who don't care about three cents are happy to take. Of course, means of transportation provide a lot of convenience for the busy people of Shanghai, but it also cultivates people's laziness. And fleeing is a great opportunity for us to reform our lives, that is, forty or fifty miles of road, when there are no cars or sedan chairs on the road early in the morning and no boats on the waterway, for the sake of survival, following the crowd to walk a long distance, and when we arrive at a safe place, although our feet are blistered and our legs are sore, we feel infinite comfort in our spirits. But after ten months of Shanghai life, I was gradually assimilated by the customs, and often felt annoyed after walking a few steps, but when the taste of fleeing came to my mind, the coming and going cars could not lure me to step on its ladder, but just thinking. Still continue my walking.</p>
<p>I recall: More than ten days on the ship, unable to move, seeing the trackers and every pedestrian on the shore, I admired them. With the permission of the boatman, we happily went ashore, as free and unrestrained as a caged bird getting its freedom. The fresh air and gentle sunshine washed away the depression of the past few days, and we ran after the boatman as if we were released (because they walked very fast), passing through villages and fields, and then walking on uneven and uneven mountain roads, but we could not run, we could only walk slowly. The five-colored wildflowers are for us to pick, and the fragrance of the grass is for us to smell. Because we are greedy for the beauty of the mountains and fields, the boatmen are far away from us and cannot be seen, so they delay their journey. Under their urging, we reluctantly returned to the ship.</p>
<p>In a village, we lived in peace. But the firewood must be picked by ourselves, so we develop the habit of carrying things and walking. The winding path and the small road on the hillside are familiar to us. At first, we are inevitably a little timid, wondering if there are tiger caves in this remote mountain. After a few times of going up the mountain, the firewood at the foot of the mountain cannot satisfy our desires, so we scramble to pick it at a higher place. When we return fully loaded, we sweat all over our bodies, which is what refugees need in winter. Therefore, whenever firewood is scarce and the weather is cold, we go up the mountain together. The few miles of flat road and the sloping mountain road do not seem difficult to us.</p>
<p>When I walk on the flat cement sidewalk, recalling these things, I no longer hate the distance and length of the journey. Although there are no five-colored wildflowers in front of me, and there are no wonderful peaks and no joy of returning fully loaded, the different arrangements in the showcases, the saving of three cents, and the heat of the whole body, are they not the same? So I walk forward without reluctance. After arriving at the destination, they are all shouting cold, and I hurriedly take off my coat. When they ask me, I smile and say: "This is the benefit of walking!"</p>

Increase or decrease stitches should be done after knitting the four edge stitches, and then knitted according to the size of the back panel to complete. When knitting to the shoulder, the right front panel should be decreased. The edge should still be moss stitch, first decreasing six stitches, then decreasing one stitch every other row, for a total of twenty-three times. Knit two more rows, decreasing four stitches in one row, and fourteen stitches in the second decrease.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Sunset <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——Impressions of a Wartime Journey</p>
<p>My friend Ke Yun has a wartime report article called "Ruins Sunset," which describes the situation in the desolate sunset outside the ransacked Taierzhuang that day. The concluding section reads:</p>
<p>Returning to the city from the wheat field, there was a dog corpse lying on the slope; dozens of steps away, there was another enemy corpse lying supine on the mud, his upper body covered with yellow mud, leaving only his legs exposed, with rubber boots still on his feet. A ray of sunset light swept across his body.</p>
<p>This impression often floated in our hearts: and an enemy soldier's poem:</p>
<p>Why are we fighting?</p>
<p>The Chinese have suffered torment,</p>
<p>We have also suffered disaster,</p>
<p>Heaven! Heaven!</p>
<p>Who will collect our remains?</p>
<p>Also often rang in our ears. The mood of this poem and the mood of "desolate sunset" are so harmonious that we feel very surprised by our inspiration at that moment. One evening, I was alone outside the North Gate of Shangrao watching the sunset, and this scene was touched again, and I suddenly felt that this mood was too familiar; I suddenly realized that this is the mood of the end of the century.——The basic mood that runs through all the poems and articles written by the enemy to record the war.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I suddenly opened the Iroha song made by the Japanese monk Kukai and said:</p>
<p>Red and purple blossoms, how pitiful they scatter?</p>
<p>Looking all over the world, how much is permanent?</p>
<p>Lost in illusion, now surpassed,</p>
<p>The remaining dream has awakened, neither drunk nor bewitched.</p>
<p>Originally, what permeated the psychology of the Japanese nation was this set of end-of-the-century moods. As the saying goes: "When the sun sets and the road is exhausted, go against the grain," the Japanese warlords' aggression frenzy was originally just a retrograde movement played by a psychology of the end of the century.</p>
<p>Every Japanese warlord is good material in Freud's mental hospital: We can only deeply understand this sentence by standing on the side of the Japanese people and removing all national prejudices. On the Japanese side, although there are self-deprecating words such as "Land of the Rising Sun" or "Asahi," the nobles and warlords who control the fate of the Japanese country, whether from the system itself or from the ×× system, have all reached the fate of "sunset" or "end of the century."</p>
<p>The Japanese room and the warlords have deeply known what the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War will be: This war will never give the Japanese people a dark fate, but the Japanese ×× room and the warlords will join hands with the German and Russian ×× room to go to the museum. This is the general explanation of the Japanese warlords' various struggling postures.</p>
<p>When the European War first broke out, the Tsar said very sadly when he signed the declaration of war, "The terrible test for me has been decided, but I will not be rewarded in this life." From the process of the European War, the people under the old Russian hell were liberated, and the fate of the Tsar's system was ended: It really makes ×× shudder at the setting sun! January 20</p>

<p>— Yue Bin</p>
<p>January sky – azure, peaceful as a sheet of water.</p>
<p>The winter wind here is still so soft, the sun shines, and the earth appears even more harmonious.</p>
<p>On the yellow sand road, we, a group of three, with excited emotions, stride towards the future.</p>
<p>Dust and sand are stirred up by hurried footsteps, and the stream on the right flows gurgling; under the distant clouds, Lotus Mountain vaguely appears beautiful; the emerging city in the distance – Shantou – looks grand enough from here.</p>
<p>This place is called Shi Dai Township.</p>
<p>We are all young men who farm the land, from eighteen to twenty-five years old. At this moment, we have just finished our tenant farming work and are rushing to the township office to draw lots to become conscripted soldiers.</p>
<p>This is already the fourth round. In the previous three rounds, we all missed out, and we were all disappointed – every time, seeing the conscripted soldiers training so spiritedly, it was worth envying.</p>
<p>Therefore, this time, we all hoped: "We should be drawn."</p>
<p>Turning a bend, passing Big Sheng's sugarcane field – in January, the sugarcane is already growing tall and dense.</p>
<p>Ah Bing behind me suddenly ran quickly into the sugarcane field. After a while, he came out holding a sugarcane stalk. He first patted off the leaves on the sugarcane, and then, shouldering the sugarcane like carrying a rifle, he puffed out his chest and ran towards us with running steps.</p>
<p>"One, two, one,... Haha! Big Sheng, do I look like a trained soldier like this?" Saying this, he lay on the ground again, using the sugarcane to make shooting gestures at us.</p>
<p>"Ah Bing, don't be happy for nothing, you probably won't get your share this time," Big Sheng said, and we continued to move forward.</p>
<p>Ah Bing patted the yellow mud off his body, broke the sugarcane into two sections, peeled off the leaves, and ate as he caught up. Facing Big Sheng, he patted his chest and raised his thumb high:</p>
<p>"Hmph! This time, I'll definitely become a soldier for you to see." He was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>I felt this was quite joyous. Before the war, as soon as we heard about "recruiting soldiers," we would escape to relatives' homes early; however, now we are all vying to become soldiers.</p>
<p>Entering the village, walking to the township office, which was converted from an ancestral hall – the patio, outside is vast, already standing nearly a hundred people, everyone showing an excited smile. (Although, for the sake of life, some still have worried faces.)</p>
<p>People formed a large circle, the township head, village chief, and fair people all stood by the square table in the middle. Everyone's attention was focused on the cylinder on the table.</p>
<p>We squeezed in, but Ah Bing pulled my sleeve and said softly:</p>
<p>"There are so many people again, only five will be drawn in total, I'm afraid we won't get our share again."</p>
<p>Suddenly, everyone became silent – the drawing of lots began.</p>
<p>Then, the fair person called out according to the list of conscripted soldiers:</p>
<p>"×××"</p>
<p>Another fair person then immediately used chopsticks to clip a paper ball into the cylinder, opened it and called out: "None" or "Yes"</p>
<p>Time passed, and those whose fate had been decided gradually left here. Suddenly, Ah Bing stretched his neck long, listening intently, and then, a smile appeared on his face – we all heard a voice "Yes!"</p>
<p>Another fair person wrote "Li Ah Bing's" name on the conscripted soldiers' register...</p>
<p>People had already dispersed, and Big Sheng and I had missed out again!</p>
<p>Walking out of the township office, our footsteps sounded heavy; "Confusion" always flashed in Big Sheng's and my minds: "Ah! We have to wait another month before we can draw lots again."</p>
<p>Ah Bing became particularly active. He talked about how Brother Jianmin hid from his wife and mother to join the army; how Miss Suwen bravely became a female soldier; his face flushed red:</p>
<p>"Waiting for this training period to join the army; at that time, hmph! Li Ah Bing will cut those old bastards with one knife...!" He slammed his palm hard on Big Sheng's neck, but Big Sheng's hand pinched him hard, and Ah Bing only screamed in pain.</p>
<p>Everyone smiled at each other again, looking at the distant mountains and rivers blurred, our mood was quiet – but our blood surged again – confident: we will become soldiers sooner or later; we will gallop on the battlefield.</p>
<p>It was already dusk, the sky was shrouded in dimness, but the earth here was still beautiful...</p>

<h3 id="e150">The American WPA Art Movement (Part 1) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt came to power, his greatest policy has been the New Deal Progress Administration, known worldwide. This is a branch of the New Deal movement.</p>
<p>The work included in the WPA in the arts includes:</p>
<p>FAP (Federal Art Project)</p>
<p>FMP (Federal Music Project)</p>
<p>FTP (Federal Theater Project)</p>
<p>FWP (Federal Writers' Project)</p>
<p>When President Roosevelt promoted his new policy, he established a Public Works Administration (PWA), and the WPA was directly under this bureau. The original purpose of establishing the Public Works Administration was to provide relief to the unemployed, so all the work in its subordinate fields was also aimed at providing relief to the unemployed. The WAP is naturally no exception, but if today we still view the four major art works under the WPA as aimed at relieving unemployment, then that is wrong. Because this kind of art movement has today developed its independent meaning. Here is a brief description of the recent situation of the four major art movements:</p>
<p>FAP's New Art Movement – The characteristic of FAP's works is that they no longer target artists or art lovers as the target of their works, but instead take the art of the national community as the foundation and directly depict the life of the American people.</p>
<p>In the early days, the artistic freedom of artists was still biased towards socialist interpretations. For example, the mural of the Rockefeller Center in New York once had Diego Rivera paint a portrait of Lenin, which caused quite a controversy at the time. Later, this portrait was withdrawn, but Rivera's works elsewhere were still accepted.</p>
<p>Because there are no galleries, in addition to mural work, they have also established dozens of galleries in the southern, midwestern, and western United States, displaying the works of famous artists and local painters, open every day until nine o'clock at night, on the one hand creating new appreciation crowds, and at the same time providing guidance to local painters, so this movement has become an individual cultural movement, and is no longer purely unemployment relief.</p>
<p>FTP's Theater Movement – The nominal administrator of this movement is Henry Hopkins, and the actual directors are Mrs. Ellen Uterhert and Mrs. Henry Flannigan. In the first two years, expenses of 13.4 million US dollars were paid, with a maximum of 12,500 participants, and now there are 9,000. This is because some states now not only feel that there are not enough unemployed actors in the state to hire, but also go to other states to borrow.</p>
<p>FTP has a complex understanding of audience requirements and the different specialties of actors, so its repertoire contains 28,000 types from ancient Greek dramas to contemporary costume dramas, including Shakespearean dramas, social dramas, pantomimes, dance dramas, and other aspects.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Pen <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>In an era of bloody storms, it is not permissible for Sakyamuni to advocate those doctrines that enable mankind to become Buddhas, because "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot" and other such decadent tunes are absolutely unsuitable for this era. Obviously, today's China is the dividing line of all prosperity and decline, and also the critical moment of all life and death. In order to win the needs of the entire nation, it is natural to have to start a national struggle of mass slaughter. China's current targets of slaughter are two: one is to destroy the powerful enemy of all mankind, and the other is to eliminate the dregs of the entire nation; and these two points can also be said: the former is external, and the latter is internal.</p>
<p>However, what are the tools for killing?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, what the soldiers hold in their hands are knives and guns, steel and sulfur; while the literati only have a pen tip that is only an inch long.</p>
<p>Don't think that the pen is a useless thing, it can only write about the West Chamber, write about the Dream of the Red Chamber, write about the Golden Lotus, write about smiling dimples, write about triangular male and female romances; similarly, it can also kill people. In history, the pen has long been used as a tool for killing, and at that time, the pen's killing work may be called pen execution. Isn't that right? "Others carry precious swords, I have a pen like a knife," how loud and cheerful does it sound?</p>
<p>It is a pity that although the pen in history can kill people, the targets killed are neither broad nor many; the crimes of the killed are not clear, and even mistakes are made, and there are even wrongful killings. In addition, because the killing is not done properly, it is often the case that it cannot be performed thoroughly and to the satisfaction of the people. Are these all the faults of the pen? Naturally not, only because the people who use it lack a little observation and a little skill. Therefore, although the pen can be used as a sharp weapon for killing, the problem still lies in the skill of the person holding the pen; the situation is similar: any knife or gun can kill people, and the final key depends on the executioner's killing technique.</p>
<p>Now, fresh blood has stained the rivers and mountains, and the mass slaughter has already begun. Whether externally or internally, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor should stand firm in their positions and carry out this sacred task. Then the authors standing on the cultural frontier should not forget the responsibility of using the pen as a knife!</p>
<p>Look: those things that put on airs; those things that wag their tails; those things that play tricks; and those things that look like humans but are not human... all have to use sharp pen tips to dissect their bellies and reveal the secrets in their hearts; cut off their heads and pour out the black curtain in their heads. Authors must absolutely use the pen to make all the ugly monsters show their true forms when they see it, and from then on dare not be rampant, so that the pen can add some historical feats to the national struggle of mass slaughter, and at the same time let the pen cultivate a little brilliant embellishment on the journey of Chinese culture!</p>

<h3 id="e152">Playwrights and Performers <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Li Amao</p>
<p>Playwrights and performers, these two kinds of people, should be united and work together, and can never be separated, just like a car has two wheels, and it is difficult to move if one is missing.</p>
<p>Therefore, in all countries of the world, these playwrights and performers, without exception, complement each other, and so is China, it was so in ancient times, and it is so recently; however, there are six or seventy years in between, when playwrights and performers completely went their separate ways.</p>
<p>In ancient China, the drama was most popular, of course, in the Yuan Dynasty. The drama at that time was what is now called Yuanqu, that is, the Kunqu opera. The lyrics of Kunqu opera are very high, so naturally, those without considerable literary cultivation cannot write them; but the conditions for cooperation between the two parties are very easy. On the script, only the singing lines and dialogues are written out, and handed over to the opera troupe, and they will perform it, and all the actions and expressions are taken care of by themselves using experience and skills. As for the lyrics, as long as there is the name of the tune, there is a way to handle it. Therefore, in the era when Kunqu opera was popular, from the Yuan Dynasty to the Qianqing Hongyang era, for hundreds of years, both parties cooperated in this way. Without actors, the playwright's works would only be for people to appreciate on paper; without playwrights, the actors would not have new things to come out.</p>
<p>However, Kunqu opera is high-brow and attracts few followers, and can only be enjoyed by the intellectual class, and is definitely not for the masses, so its life cannot be long after all. Later, it was revolutionized by the popular Huiju and Peking opera, causing a storm. Once these popular things became popular, there was no room for playwrights to intervene. The actors themselves could handle those vulgar sentences, so naturally there was no need for playwrights. Therefore, playwrights and performers, although like lips and teeth dependent on each other, in this era, were completely separated, in other words: there was no existence of playwrights.</p>
<p>Even if one or two literati, occasionally happy, wanted to write a script for them, they would take it and would not be able to use it at all. Because their consistent method is that whenever they write a new play, they don't need any script, they only write an "outline." On this "outline," only the names of the people in each scene are written, and there is no plot at all. They only rely on the person who directs the play to speak with an expert tone to tell them, and that's it. So it is definitely not something that outsiders can do. If an outsider wants to direct a play for them, then there are many difficulties. For example, in the first scene, someone comes on stage. Then the actor asks: How do I come on stage? Still rushing wind? Still fish at the bottom of the water? Still playing the lead? Still singing? Still playing the small gong? He said all kinds of things, and the playwright was already scared. In case there are a few people who think that this outsider is coming to take the job of the insider, then there will inevitably be things like eating tofu happening. If a playwright must plan to write a play with them, then he must first become an insider himself; but this is not an easy thing, so this kind can be said to be very, very few, we only saw one Ouyang Yuqian.</p>
<p>Playwrights and performers are naturally complementary, how can they not cooperate? The reason why old dramas have not progressed in recent years is mostly here. Especially in Shanghai, old dramas and Hollywood films are placed in front of the audience at the same time, and when compared in terms of thought, the difference is naturally too great.</p>
<p>However, recently, spoken dramas and movies are popular, and these two kinds of things, they fully cooperate with playwrights, and fundamentally they cannot be established without good scripts. The so-called good scripts are not the transformation of scenes, but how the thoughts are. With good scripts, the performers have a basis to give play to their talents and experiences. Performers who can understand the spirit and meaning of the script can create a good play. The more the two parties cooperate, the better the results.</p>

<p>Vigorously Developing Is the Only New Type of Theater</p>
<p>Although drama is an art, on the other hand, it is also a noble entertainment needed by the general public. Therefore, no matter what kind of drama, it should take the premise of improving society and correcting all bad customs and habits, and become a noble entertainment that is beneficial to intelligence and health; it must enable the audience to obtain the true meaning of entertainment at a very small price. I am a lover of spoken drama, so I am happy to talk about spoken drama.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that there are few spoken drama venues at sea, but if you want to find a place that is both elegant and popular and somewhat satisfactory, then after the opening of the "Drama Theater", it has released a different color for the Shanghai spoken drama scene, and can be said to be a new type of spoken drama theater in Shanghai, so I excitedly watched it several times in a row, and finally did not make</p>
<p>No matter what kind of public entertainment venue, if it can truly gain a good reputation, it is definitely not something that can be achieved by relying solely on one-sided propaganda or subjective praise from a few people. It must be shown to the public to be appreciated by all. Therefore, the current "Green Treasure Theater" already has a bright and splendid position, and is vigorously developing. The reason why "Green Treasure" can have such achievements today, as I see it, is probably due to the following two reasons:</p>
<p>First: the greatness of the organizers' spirit of serving society. "Green Treasure" is organized by New New Company. Because of the strong capital and suitable location, all the equipment is far superior to other theaters, and it is naturally able to attract the audience. In addition, the company's management is strict, so it is very satisfactory in terms of seats, scenery, lighting, and props. This point is recognized by everyone. Now there is a panic about scripts everywhere, and "Green Treasure" is able to select and perform newly compiled famous plays in a brand-new posture, looking down on the entire Shanghai spoken drama scene. This is its characteristic.</p>
<p>Second: the excellence and neatness of the troupe's talents - the backstage of "Green Treasure" is jointly responsible by Chen Qiufeng, Wang Manjun, and Liu Yixin, who are entrusted by the company's authorities. They are all all-rounders in the drama and art world. Under their clever design and leadership, all the actors have the opportunity to fully develop their individual performances, so every play has achieved a vivid and realistic harvest. In terms of actors, men such as Liu Yixin, Wang Manjun, Gu Menghu, Qin Haha, Tian Xiaoqing, Hu Liaoran, Wang Shanquiao, Luo Fei, Hu Shiqi, etc., each have their own strengths. Female roles such as Fan Xuepeng, Qian Aili, Tian Xin, Wang Bing, Wang Aina, Cai Juanjuan, Lu Ping, Li Ping, Qian Zhen, Qian Huixia, etc., are either naturally charming, or beautiful and gentle, or dignified and calm, or petite and exquisite, or innocent and romantic, and are all rare people.</p>
<p>"Green Treasure Theater" has the above two reasons, so its achievements have also progressed rapidly. Now the words "Green Treasure" have been deeply imprinted in the minds of Shanghai ladies. It has become the authority of spoken drama at sea, and it can proudly look down on its peers and be proud of itself.</p>
<p>However, to put it back, drama changes with the times, and if you don't advance, you retreat. I hope that the authorities and artists of the theater will not be complacent because they have a position, but should continue to work hard and move forward. At the same time, I hope that the playwrights will write more famous plays that are beneficial to the world and the people, so that the masses in the isolated island can invisibly get spiritual edification in entertainment. This is my sincere wish.</p>

<p>— Hong Huang</p>
<p>After Miss Gu Han performed "Night of Joy" at the Red Star Luanchang, she continued to play the leading role of Xiao Lilian in "Ren Zhi Chu". Her fluent and clear dialogue, profound and natural acting skills, are unanimously recognized by the art world as a promising talent. It is said that she is studying music, so her performance is full of beautiful rhythm.</p>
<p>After "Thunderstorm", Red Star will stage the famous play "Sunrise". Because she was alone in "Ren Zhi Chu" and helped Red Star a lot, the main leader Wang Yigong will personally play the role of Manager Pan to show his respect to Miss Gu. Because the rehearsal of "Sunrise" is led by Miss Gu, who will play the leading role of the social butterfly Chen Bailu, she is naturally very suitable for Xiao Lilian in "Ren Zhi Chu". However, some people in the troupe insisted that she play the role of Xiao Dongxi, and now Miss Gu has agreed to try it. When Miss Gu plays the leading role of Chen Bailu, Wang Yigong plays Manager Pan; when Chen Bailu is played by Bai Yan, Miss Gu plays the role of Xiao Dongxi.</p>
<p>Not to mention the spoken drama, the audience of the movie "Sunrise" is also quite large. Lu Luming's Chen Bailu, Yuan Meiyun's Xiao Dongxi, these two are very different roles. Gu Han will hold two positions, and one is the leading role and the other is the supporting role. Miss Gu's contribution to the spoken drama world will release a brilliant brilliance.</p>

<p>——Almost Sacrificed for "The Ambition of Jasper"</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng, the pillar of the Green Treasure Theater, recently starred in a film for Yihua Company, named "The Ambition of Jasper". Fan played a social butterfly in the play, and her performance was very lewd. She first married Wang Naidong, and later suddenly took a fancy to Wang Yin, and even put her ex-husband in prison. Her vicious performance was extremely detailed. Recently, the film was shooting the scene where Wang Naidong broke out of prison and returned home to kill Fan Xuepeng. At that time, Fan was feeling a little unwell, but in order for the company to finish the film as soon as possible, she insisted on filming while sick. She can be said to have done her best for art. Unexpectedly, when Wang Naidong fired a shot to kill Fan, the gunpowder of the blank bullet in the gun was too strong. With a loud bang, Fan fell to the ground. The staff thought that Fan Xuepeng was pretending to fall, and sighed that her performance was very realistic. Suddenly, they heard Fan moaning on the ground? Director Yue Feng was very surprised and rushed to see her, and saw blood stains on Fan's arm, and then realized that she was injured. He immediately bandaged her and sent her home, fortunately without any major problems. However, Green Treasure lost several days because of this. Fan once said to others, "The Ambition of Jasper" is her life's work, and it turns out that there was such a risky process.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Guo Zhongheng was Gong Yunfu's Yin-Yang Follower</p>
<p>At that time, Fengqing was already decadent and weak, not like a person. When he sang, he only saw his head swaying and his eyes wide open. Although the taste was good, unfortunately, he could only sit in the front row and occasionally hear a sentence or two. Therefore, Zhongheng had the opportunity to rush up. Therefore, the first criticism of coming to Shanghai was not bad. Unfortunately, later his hobby was too deep, and the more he smoked, the fatter his body became. Not only was he weak and his voice dry, but he gradually declined, and he often made mistakes. By the time he and Da Yuanfu Quan had disagreements with Cheng Laosi at the same time and left Yanqiu's troupe, his reputation also declined from then on. As the saying goes: If you can't achieve high, you can't achieve low, and Guo Erye suffered from these six words. In the few years before his death, he simply couldn't get a job, and his hobby harmed him.</p>
<p>Although Zhongheng's medical skills were not very good, they were still passable. Usually, if someone in the same profession had a sudden illness, and it was impossible to invite or could not afford to invite a doctor in the middle of the night, as long as they gave him a call, even if he was already asleep on the kang, he would immediately get up, put on his clothes, and go straight to the patient's house. He would diagnose the pulse and give injections, all without cash, and he would have to pay for the medicine himself. Therefore, his popularity in the Pear Garden industry was indeed not bad. Especially Grandma Gong, known as Fengguan, would call Guo Erye to see a doctor every three to five days. If he occasionally performed in Pingjin, he would have to bring Zhongheng with him first, unwilling to go on stage. One year, when the Du family's ancestral hall was completed, except for Shu Yan, all the famous actors from Beiping came south. Yunfu was old and didn't want to come, but later he was still encouraged by Zhongheng, who said that with me as a bodyguard, there would be no mistakes. Lao Gong then boldly set off, and returned safely to the north after the play. In less than two years, Gong and Guo died one after another. Colleagues said that Guo Erye went to the underworld to be a guard with Lao Gong.</p>
