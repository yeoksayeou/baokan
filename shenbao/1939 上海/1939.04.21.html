<h3>社評　法租界糾紛之側面觀</h3>
<p>昨上海法租界內，市民與捕房之間，因懸旗問題遽滋糾紛，本報昨既評述其事，對兩方各進忠告。縱觀本市論壇，不謀而合，衆議僉同。夫就問題之本質言之：較諸當前之種種問題，實屬渺小；若必析求曲直是非，亦儘多研討餘地；蓋尙情尙理。見智見仁，或剛或柔，可諒可爭，所以論斷之者，雖大相逕庭可也。顧乃各紓觀感，竟得殊途同觀，念念於中法邦交，諄諄於大事化小，小事化無；此所反映者，謂非「國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第一，意志集中，力量集中」，經二十二月砲火之鍛鍊，蔚爲共通之情緒，演爲共通之感應，經茲微妙之試騐而益信。輿論健全，郅治之本；此則記者竊願與論壇同志更相勗勉於今後者也。迄昨日傍晚，糾紛已告段落，相恕相安，宜無枝節；藉曰尙有爭議，不容放棄，其性質之重，關係之大，猶在前昨兩日糾紛之上，則其問題即已不在市民與捕房之間，留待主管者折衝，責有攸歸焉。</p>
<p>茲有未安緘默，請得而申言之者：糾紛既作，捕風捉影之談，神經過敏之說，頗波動於中外社會；或視爲國民黨所發縱指使，或視爲共產黨所構煽鼓動；或視此爲法人媚强抑弱之徵，不勝其憤懣；或視此爲華人志高氣揚之漸，不無所寒心；凡此云云，似是而皆非，不可以不闢。何謂似是？糾紛由懸旗，懸旗由國民精神總動員，精神總軌員由國民黨倡導，故以糾紛爲有所發縱指使而疑國民黨。歷來罷課罷工罷市，共產黨輒左袒，此次若干商店停業，跡近罷市★况有以共產云云，故意隱约招搖者，故以糾紛爲有所構煽鼓動而疑共產黨。捕房方面取締懸旗之理由，能否成立，姑置勿論，然對於一國國旗，直接行動，此其出之操切，自不可諱，顧何爲而竟爲之，疑爲顧忌環境，於是惡之爲媚强抑弱。中國抗戰，有必勝之信念，乃在抗戰之中途，在瓦全之孤島，猶好與租界當局抗爭，疑爲必勝信念之餘緒，於是惡之爲志高氣揚。誣國民黨之發縱指使，誣共產黨之構煽鼓動者，謀破壞二黨也；誣法人之媚强抑弱，誣華人之志高氣揚者，謀離間二國也；蓋有所爲而誣者也。</p>
<p>抑何以知其誣？黨有黨略，國有國策，此黨此國之一切措施，必奉之爲圭臬。其有與之刺謬者，或非其黨黨員，或非其國國人；即使是彼黨員，是彼國人，亦不可視爲代表其黨若國。中國之國民黨與共產黨，今方致力於抗戰建國：以建國之生產言，以抗戰之『國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第一，意志集中，力量集中』言，決不願見糾紛，遑論製造糾紛；決不願言停業，遑論鼓動罷市。糾紛由於不甘受操切之直接行動，停業由於遭遇刺激後之消極意氣，夫於國民黨共產黨何與？事關國際者，在法國方面，方與英國策動反侵略之團結，蓋以扶弱禦暴爲國策，奈何謂有媚强抑弱之意念？在中國方面，不但在抗戰中途，屢屢標揭友敵之義，求友惟恐不及：除敵而外，豈願國與國間，民與民間，有何異軍突起摩擦；豈顧糾紛，為親者痛而仇者快？不但如此而已、中國抗戰、在主觀為自衛，在客觀則爲友邦在遠東之共同利益；抗戰勝利之後，無論爲恢復瘡痍，甦息民生，爲啓發農鑛，爲凡百建設，爲國際貿易，尤在在需要友邦之人才物資，共赴偉業；而戰前戰時以及戰後，中國將始終與友邦以共信者，乃爲一切國際倏约之信守不渝；中國與其友邦患難禍福之關係若斯，乃謂肯以志高氣揚之態度，以疏友邦耶？以此誣中國者，謀所以使國際憂疑於中國抗戰勝利後，將不利於各國之利益而已，謀所以使國際低减其對於中國抗戰之同情而已，若前昨上海法租界之糾紛，固彼離間中外之絕好口實也。莫或輕信，顧尤莫若善自珍重！</p>

<h3>愛情的改造作用</h3>
<p>有許多男女，於結婚之後，他們的思想行動以及個性習慣，全都改變了。因此，使我們知道愛情實有巧妙的改造作用。這是事實，一個性情驕傲的少女，在娘家時會連爹娘都不肯向他們低頭，一切均是她的世界。然而一旦嫁了一個加意情郞，不特在她的生理上起着重大的變化，就是性情也會變得無限體貼溫存地來服侍着她心愛的丈夫，有時生了愛情結晶的孩子，雖在未嫁前無論是如何的好尚清潔，然而自己孩子的屎尿，她一點也不覺得骯髒。她有時更懷着欽佩的心情，以爲她心愛的丈夫眞是個萬能的改造博士。</p>
<p>男子也是一樣，有許多婚前浪用者，每於婚後變得十分的節儉了。更有把愛妻視作爲他的靈魂，一切言語行爲都給這靈魂主宰着，與前完全判若兩人。也有身體衰弱者，於婚後變得健康了。誠因一個成人的生活，實在脫離不了愛情。西諺也有說·『一個圓滿的生活必須以知慧來作領導，用愛情以爲鼓勵。』要是一個人而失却了愛情，那他的生活，將感覺着多麼枯燥與悲慘呢？所以無論男或女，只要爲了愛情，無不願意給他或她改造的。誠然，一個精力豐沛的男子一旦娶了一個健美多姿的女郞，因爲愛情的濃蜜，就是在思想行爲個性習慣上發生些差異，但這差異必然會潛移默化着，以漸驅於一致，因此，在愛的協調中旣改造了自己，又創造了他們米來的生命，這是多麼的美化而幸福呀！</p>
<p>不過，改造必須要本體的健全，假使男子如果於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾以及憂勞斲傷之故，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，那在夫婦基礎的性生活上，必不能圓滿，愛情因以毀滅，旣無愛情，常然更談不到改造和創造，恐怕連他們整個的世界也都要隨之毀滅，不是因無愛情而致離婚自殺者眞是多着嗎？</p>
<p>聰明丈夫欲謀補救，即必須根本治療其疾病，治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』最爲對症特效，因此劑於服後一日夜即可生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，能繼續服用必可於短期內根本治愈上述各症。惟有遺精者，須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速，若能親來本診所就專家翳師診斷後，施用各種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯和妊娠關係</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>在全國國民精神總動員的今日。我們再也不能離開健康而能繁殖生存，健康不僅是每個男子所不可忽視的問題，而且也是每個女子應該努力以求其成，在歐美的女子，她們對於建美的常識，異常充實，她們認淸乳峯的發育，是爲造成健的靈魂，丰腴的臀部，是構成美的軀壳，她們無時不在利用種種科學方法，以求達到健美的標凖。</p>
<p>有鐵一般的事實擺在眼前，但看乳峯萎癟的女子，一定失去健康幸福，多病多痛，不但將來在健美上競爭，必遭失敗，而且一旦進入兩性生活，亦必促成不感不娠諸症，即使受胎，那麼產生下來的子女，非但養育困難，而且因爲母體乳汁的稀少，或過分尪弱，其死亡也特別容易，結果，外不能容身於社會，和男子們一樣服務盡職，內不能博歡於丈夫，勃豁時生，或竟爲丈夫棄置不顧，幸福毫無！</p>
<p>但女性的乳峯何以會萎癟的呢？此據世界婦科名醫Randeaning及余等經騐，均認爲由於自凟，束胸，白帶，月經不調，以及產後虛弱，而致卵巢機能遭受摧殘所致，唯一補救辦法，祇有積極服以卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑配製精良，服後一日夜問即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不但可使萎癟的乳峯，變得高聳，同時還能使瘦削的臀部，變成丰腴，强身美顏，功難盡述。</p>
<h3>遺精與自凟靑年的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>靑年人的自凟問題實在太嚴重了，因爲這是走上窮途末路的起點，一個靑年在春情發動初期，一經自凟，極易成癖，惡癖稍深，精關必受其摧殘而致鬆弛，性神經因受過分刺激，亦極易呈衰弱狀態，至此階段必繼起遺精症。精夜與我人的健康和壽命均有着重大的關係。今一有遺精，體內精液即等於有了漏卮，那身體健康勢必急遽的低落下來，因此，漸是面黃肌瘦，食慾不振，腦力衰弱，記憶不良，腰酸背痛，肢體疲困，精神萎靡，志氣消沉，此種靑年，如在學校求學，則心神煩亂，鴻鵠將至，學業必低於儕輩之後，甚或不能及格而致退學。如欲習業，更何能克苦耐勞，忠勤職守，不特技藝不得高明，且有失業之處！如在情場中講戀愛，因爲體貌不揚，必爲異性所擯棄，陷於失戀痛苦，抑有甚者，如遺精過頻，發育機能受其阻止，致身材低矮，性器短小如指，腎虧無能，精薄不育等症，更將相繼而來。這樣，在夫婦生活上，必爲妻憎恨，家庭間演出悲劇，或子女無出，貽終生大憾！</p>
<p>遺精的唯一治法，在此時祇有連續『希米脫氏固精片』，以固精關，鎭靜神經，遺精即可痊愈，能因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可收却病延年之功。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等各種對症特效療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>容易根治的急性淋</h3>
<p>急性白濁，因患者之痛苦不堪，而且是初次遇見，更不知所措。實際上此種急性淋，並不如病家痛苦時所感到的危險。不但並非危險之症候，而且實是容易治療之症候。患者之意識，實處以鎮靜，並急速請富有經騐，設備完全而肯負責之醫家治療，庶幾可以在七八天內根本治愈。急性白濁最火之難題，是在醫家之能否負責。爲病家作澈底治療，及病家能否攝生及擯棄不良之劣藥而已。如能愼重於擇醫及攝生，實爲病家最易解脫淋毒之痛苦，病家千萬注意！。</p>
<p>斑者每於不潔性交之後第三四日間，發生病象。身發三十七八度之體溫，　頭腫大包皮　轉，膿血交作，排尿異常困難等症。余對於急性白濁之治療，首採川特製菌苗及最超特的化學療法，同時並用德國瀘淋平流電療法，並用冷却法等，使體內發生一種抗毒作用，迅速撲滅如火如茶之淋菌，及制止炎症之熾烈，故可以當天止痛，三天淸濁消炎，一星期可以完全治愈。歷試不爽，歐西各國專家，近來對於此等療法頗　興趣，採川者日多，凡各著名花柳病院，均一致採用。良由其成績優　，治愈急性淋占百分之九十以上云</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>反侵略同盟的範圍</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>現在的世界，巳經到了牽一髮而全身動的地步。誰要閉關自守，站在雲端裹看厮殺，固已有所不能，即使要對別國唯唯否否，虛與委蛇，也非事實所許可。只有投身到這大大的漩渦裏，與世浮沉，而且也只有向左轉或向右轉，加入一邊，決不能再守中立。素來不管歐洲大事的美國，現在羅斯福一再宣言，有所干涉了，並且顯然加入了民治國方面，就是我這種見解的證明。</p>
<p>這是說，到了現在，每一國的自身，必須表明其態度，而有以自處；因此，同時，若干國家的結合，例如反侵略同盟，也就應該盡量容納志同道合的與國，一併加入，不能爲了强弱，大小，遠近，或任何關係，而有所瞻顧，徘徊，遲疑不決，以致拒人於門外。理由很簡單：蓋旣然是一種結合，要與對方相抗，那就勢力越大越好，同盟者自然多多益善了。反侵略同盟的應該擴大範圍，我已經再三說過，就是這個原故。</p>
<p>不過反侵略同盟的擴展到遠東來，却更有着充份的必要。這話，我也早已說過，現在，據美聯社所傳，英國議員漢特遜，也在作如此的主張了：「反共軸心旣有一端在東亞，是則新集體安全制亦必須包括東方及歐洲，始能生效。」此外，英國的外交家也都以爲：「倘目下英法與蘇聯之談判，爲建立反侵略陣綫之第二階段，則中國及亞洲其他國家之加入反侵略陣綫爲第三階段·」是呀，所謂反共，就是侵略，而遠東的自命反共國家，本來已在侵略，要防止任何國家的侵略，以求全世界的和平，怎可以棄遠東，尤其中國，而不包括在反侵略同盟之內呢！</p>
<p>張伯倫對於漢德遜的詢問，英國政府是否已決定需要中國及其他遠東國家加入反侵略大同盟，回答說：「英國甚願考慮此項問題。」我希望張伯倫的確就會考慮此項問題，而予以正面的決定，因爲這實在是反侵略同盟能否有效的試金石。</p>
<p>至於中國，我相信對於此項同盟，當然是樂於加入的，因爲我們現在已在從事徹底的反侵略，有人來邀我們共同進行，又何樂而不爲呢！</p>
<h3>雪地行軍</h3>
<p>— 芷茵</p>
<p>太陽密密的隱藏在叢山的深處，露出一絲灰白色的光輝。天空呈現着可怕的死灰色，像要呑下這巨大的地面，四周是陰沉得像伸出了爪牙要掠取食物的巨獸的眼。</p>
<p>北風從山的空隙，從樹的枝枚間，從河面上，平地上，四面八方的刮過來，捲過山，捲過樹，捲過平地河面，張開了翅膀掃蕩着，掃蕩着這黎明的陰黯，死寂。</p>
<p>這時候，只有一種光，閃爍在大地上，那是一種玉石般潔白，水晶樣凈輝，野鴨絨那麼柔和的光。哦！看！望出去曲曲繞繞的一圈山上，平平伏伏的鋪着一層銀白的東西，山上的碎石成了一顆顆各種形狀的珠子，枯了的樹枚像忽然開滿了梨花，而且是一種從未看見過的茂盛潔白的梨花，花瓣像由一根根銀絲織成的。那條大路也變成由寳石砌成的了，又像是鋪了白絨的嶄平的地氈，……哦，那是雪，那是雪的光。在閃爍的銀白色的包圍中，小溪特別綠得可愛，那碧淸的緣像羣星中一顆月亮那樣的昻然聖潔和嬌媚。</p>
<p>隱隱的，響起了喇叭的號聲，音符跳動着凄楚和悲哀，動人的飄盪在空間。</p>
<p>遠遠的，現出了一大串草綠色的行列，在慢慢的向前移動，那行列現出在山峯上，現出在山隙間，現出在對面的山上，……無盡頭似的，現出在羣山間。</p>
<p>遙遙的，聽見了馬的嘶聲，拖得長長的，帶着盪人心腑的凄厲。</p>
<p>除此以外，再沒有其他的聲響，只有草鞋踏在雪地中，發出微微的擦！擦！聲。</p>
<p>凝住的空氣只給衝散了一角，四周還是陰沉沉的，大地還睡得夢眼惺忪的沒大醒來。</p>
<p>山上，路上，雜亂的現出了無數個不整齊的脚印，慢慢過來，那脚印愈現愈多了，給這一大片潔白刻上了創痕。</p>
<p>太陽漸漸的從叢山的深處透露出一點紅光來了，紅的日光照在白的雪上，把樹，山，和地面都換上了淡粉紅色的衣裳，好像是一個魔術中的彩色世界。</p>
<p>張開胸，深深的吸一口淸晨的空氣，新鮮和芬芳，直感入腑臟。全身沐浴着晨曦的微光，寒冷似乎也减少了些，感到了一種光明將要來到的喜悅和欣慰。幾萬個人，昻起了頭，幾萬顆心，起了同一的共鳴·黎明，黎明將要來到，中國的勝利的黎明將要來到。</p>
<p>幾萬個人，都是來自遙遙的南方。今天，奉命要從東南戰塲，經過幾千里長途的跋涉，越過山脈，穿過長橋，公路，鐵道，調到長江以北去。幾萬個人抱着同一的信心，同一的志願，今天，要開始一個艱難的遙遠的行軍，沒有一點胆怯，沒有一點恐懼，因爲眼睛裹已望見了祖國的勝利的光。</p>
<p>雪，對於這些，來自南方的健兒是一種新奇的東西，從沒見過這樣光亮這樣潔白凈輝這樣柔軟的東西，這簡直是一種夢景，一個神話。他們大多數是沒有離過家的，只有少數曾經在十二年前跟隨過大軍北征過，看見過雪，……</p>
<p>「刷，刷，刷，刷，……」幾萬個人在雪中行軍，太陽射出了和暖的光，天空不再是死灰色的了，四周的陰沉也給驅散了。雪的光，太陽的光，交織成光明的勝利的預兆。</p>
<p>「刷，刷，刷，刷，……」行列在向前移動着。</p>
<p>軍號又在響了，雄偉的，壯嚴的。</p>

<p>現在我們的游擊隊，聲勢浩大起來了，　軍日夜都感着不安。進攻　　的消息，不斷的傳進了敵人的陣營，他們都惶恐懼怕，只好深溝高壘，加重防守工作，於是挖戰壕的需要，就刻不容緩了。</p>
<p>挖戰壕需要着大量的人工，他們便下鄉間去，四處强拉民伕，一到人家，看見是男子，無論老的，壯的，都用粗笨的蔴繩，一個連一個縛着，一串又一串的牽着走。</p>
<p>在途中走的時候，不准呼呌，不准哭泣，犯了這兩「命令」，就給一頓飽打。若有人企圖脫逃那就會立刻槍斃。到了他們的目的地後，每人分發一柄鐵鋤，或鋤頭，又下令全體動手，開始在他們指定的地方，挖掘挖掘，不停的挖掘！</p>
<p>晚間呢，是休息的時候了，睡眠的地方，就是自己勞力挖出來的壕溝，上面有濕氣寒風，不停的襲來，下面是水潦潮泥，冰冽着飢膚，餓着肚子，倦着身子，一堆一堆的相偎着，站，坐，臥，都不安寗，全夜不會有一分鐘的睡眠。</p>
<p>天還未亮的時候，又下令工作了：挖掘！挖掘！不停的挖掘！</p>
<p>吃飯呢，每天只有一餐，每人只有一碗飯，重量只有四兩。不但沒有菜而且沒有湯，甚至筷子也沒有。那末用手抓來吃吧？不！他們的「命令」，是不准用手抓的，只可學狗吃屎樣用「嘴舐」！誰敢用手抓吃時，馬上就戳一刺刀，這還是「薄懲」，有時會遭槍斃！</p>
<p>到了要大小便時，也不准離開壕溝一步，「命令」是「便」在溝中。</p>
<p>在工作時，不准談笑，就是哭泣也不准，「命令」是啞靜！一遇見監工的　軍來，誰見了誰得鞠躬，還要帶着笑臉的鞠躬，否則即爲失禮，定會捱兩記耳光。</p>
<p>凡是因爲吃不過勞苦飢寒而死的，或是犯了「命令」被打，被殺而死的，「命令」不准移葬，就把屍身充作泥土，堆在壕溝上面，算是加厚尺寸土壘</p>
<p>總之被拉去的同胞，一切都犧牲在壕溝中：工作在壕溝中，睡眠在壕溝中，大小便在壕溝中，死了也埋在壕溝中！可憐還有一些未死的同胞，仍在敵人强迫之下爲他們挖掘！挖掘！不停的挖掘！</p>

<h3>山峯上</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>跨過險蹺的山坡，踏上那崎嶇的山道，筠瘻似地，伏在荆叢下，好似小蛇在蜿蜒着。</p>
<p>想不到危險，記不起勞苦，人們旣踏上這山的側坡，都有着到達嶺巓的期望，誰都不願在半山中止，那怕有着深壑危崖，和一切巘險的道路！</p>
<p>高峯，聳立在雲霄之間，那是人們希望的花蕾·卽使登高是世界上最艱難的事，可是爲了有着巍峨的目的地，什麼都不能减去人們的勇氣了！</p>
<p>在山峯上，覺得世界太渺小了，山脚下的幽谷，太黑暗了，人間一切的卑劣的陰惡的陋俗的行爲和觀念，都在心底飛躍了出去！</p>
<p>在山峯上，祇有着崇高和光明！</p>
<h3>從本位上完成的使命</h3>
<p>— 小春</p>
<p>把軍事設備的物質條件比較：中國要和處心積慮了幾十年的侵略者作戰，本來是非常艱苦而困難的。但從七七蘆溝橋事變發生起，中國就在這艱難困苦的環境中，和侵略者酣鬥了二十一個月，不但抗戰的主力未被擊破，而且全綫的形勢，也是愈趨於好轉了。這不能不說是精神勝過物質，也是中華民族精神偉大的一個證明。</p>
<p>「一盤散沙，」這是西洋人對於中華民族的一個傳統的侮辱，而侵略者也正在這「一槃散沙」的估計之下，發揮着侵略的野心，滿想在「三月」「半年」的短時期內，把這老大的中國，鯨吞下去。不料，我們中華民族，在革命的主義的薰陶之下，早已從「一槃散沙，」煆煉成一座銅牆鐵壁的金城了。在目前的環境裏，大家知道要求得國際上的自由平等，完成革命的使命，是要在艱難困苦中解放出來的，所以物質上的條件儘管簡陋，我們奮鬥的精神，却是愈戰愈旺盛！在侵略者的野心未曾放棄以前，中國人是決不屈膝於砲火之前的！</p>
<p>事實旣是告訴我們：精神力量的偉大，已在過去的二十一個月，消耗了侵略者大量的人力，物力，財力，而使它陷入於進退維谷的境地了；照理最後勝利的把握，人人應當確信而無疑了，然而少數恐日病者，如汪精衛之流，還是漠視着精神力量的偉大，不惜卑躬屈膝的出賣着靈魂和人格，一再發表他主和的謬論，這眞是喪心病狂之極了。這次中央推行精神總動員，一方面果然要我們全國同胞，反省着自己：一切言論，行動，以及生活，是否都是嚴肅而合乎十二條國民公約的規定？同時另一方面，要我們每一個中國同胞，大家肩荷着救國的使命，先把自已隊伍裏的偽抗戰者，澈底的淸除出去，然後同一了步伐，再向侵略者作一個總反攻。所以十七日蔣委員長的演辭，對於這次國民精神總動員的實施，認爲「關係着國家存亡，民族生機，抗戰成敗的第一件大事。」</p>
<p>不過，我們實施了精神總動員以後，全國同胞，大家展開了反攻的姿態，漢奸和侵略者，在他們恐慌的情緒中，必然要顯示着回光反照的窮極相。在這塲合之下，我們就應當堅定信念，不受利誘，不懼威脅的不放棄本位的使命。而我們文化人，尤應艱苦卓絕，在不怕死，不怕苦，不怕難的精神貫澈之下，對於侵略者和漢奸，極盡其口誅筆伐的能事，完成着本位的使命。</p>
<p>上海向來是文化的中心，雖在惡勢力包圍之下，文化界有少數敗類，在認賊作父的幹着賣國的勾當，然而多數文化人的艱苦奮鬥，也是不必辯白的事實。所謂「頭可斷，志不屈，」的讀書人的傳統精神，還是很光榮的保持着。然而不能自認滿足，而鬆懈了我們的責任，還應當加倍努力，完成着我們本位上的光榮使命。</p>

<h3>關於禁懸國旗</h3>
<p>— 一市民</p>
<p>關於前日國民精神總動員宜傳週之農工商界宣傳日，法租界當局禁懸國旗而引起之誤會，實實在在是「不幸的事件」。因爲在我們中國進行抗戰的過程中，除了最大的敵人以及其同盟國（如德意）外，英美法蘇以及共他國家，都是我們最友好的朋友。而英美法蘇等和平民主國家，不管是他們的政府，或是民衆，都多多少少在精神上物質上，給與我們的幫助的。因此，禁懸國旗，我們也只好認爲是由於一種誤會而產生出來的「不幸的事件」了。</p>
<p>其實，進一步來講，日本帝國主義的進攻中國，並不是單純的要滅亡我們中國，而是要進一步的由他來「大同」世界，這在田中義一的「奏摺」中，已彰明較著地揭露出來了。最近日本因碰了蘇聯張鼓舉的一鼻子的灰，因此改「北進」而「南進」了。海南島旣被佔於先，而新南島又被佔於後，這些，對於法國，實在是很不敬的一種舉動。而「南進政策」的逐漸推行，美國艦隊的調往太平洋，從這些具體的事實中看來，我們中國的抗戰，一方面旣是爲求我們民族的生存，而另方面，又何嘗不是替英法保護他們的利益呢？「中國爲英國而戰，一英政府閣員的這呼聲，在今天還震響着大家的耳鼓。因此我們中國的抗戰，是並不妨害其他友邦的利益，相反，只有日本的侵佔中國，那才是妨害了各大民主國家在遠東的利益呢。</p>
<p>現在在各淪陷區中，正膨脹着反英運動，而在一切的傀儡報紙上，强調着「反白種人」的思想，所謂「反英運動」，其實就是包含着反法反美反蘇等各民主國家的運動。由此可見，日本的野心，是多麼的大。因此，英法美等民主國家，非但在精神上要同情我們的抗戰，更需要在物質上來援助我們的抗戰呢。對於我們的懸旗來表示我們的國民精神的總動員，更不宜禁止，並且應該加以同情而幫助的。</p>
<p>但是「不幸的事件」總因「誤會」而發生了，我們一方面當然對抗爭懸掛國旗自由而奮鬥的法租界同胞表示敬佩，同時我們更希望這「不幸的事件」不應該擴大起來。要曉得，目前我們只有一個敵人，我們對法租界當局道禁懸國旗的誤會，應加以誠懇的商談，以免冉度發生這同樣的「不幸的事件」。同時，我們切不要給敵人和一切的漢奸和托派造機會來給他們利用。漢奸們會說：「看白種人吧！」一托派會說：「打倒一切帝國主義」。我們切不要上當，以免給移轉目光。希望我們同胞們注意的，也是希望法租界的當局者注意的。說禁懸國旗是避免「意外事件」，那末，得的結果會恰巧相反，而反會產生「意外事件」呢。</p>
<h3>黑傘大盜</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>「黑傘大盜」（Ambnsh）像普通的偵探片一樣，它寫大盜搶刦銀行，最後終於破案，盜魁就擒。所以稱之謂「黑傘大盜」，那是因爲盜魁傘不離手，作爲兇器使用的緣故。</p>
<p>如果作爲一張偵探片看，它是太單調了，雖然它也有着施用烟幕，盜攫巨款；汽車追隨；飛機逃遁：及最後的捕獲盜魁等等驚險塲面，但是這些塲面，我們已經看得太多了，而且導演者也祇是平鋪直叙的搬演故事，它無疑的是引不起觀衆的興趣的。</p>
<p>勉强可以提出來一說的，是那個生性下流，喜與盜匪爲伍的弟弟查利，終於被在太平銀行做女書記的姊姊珍妮所感化，使他感到慚疚而與盜匪在飛機中格鬥，以致身死。我們當然還能記起「孤兒樂園」中茀萊納根神父的話：「世界上沒有一個壞孩子」，那末，這也不過是改良主義的尾巴而已。</p>
<p>這里飾汽車夫湯尼的勞合瑙倫，他和桃樂珊拉摩合演的「河上戀歌」，並不得體，本片中恢復了老本行，還能多一點做戲的機會。</p>
<p>演「黑傘盜」的Ernest　Truex，我記不起他從前演過什麼戲，這里似乎還合身份，頗有大盜機警而沉着的態度。</p>
<h3>「香姝寶馬」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>李却葛林，那個勞勃泰勒的第三代（第二代應該是泰倫鮑華），和洛麗泰楊曾經在「四傑傳」中合作過，現在又合作了這部彩色片「香姝寳馬」。這使人想到「蘇彝士」中洛麗泰楊和泰倫鮑華的合作，不禁有「江山代有才人出」之感，而靑春易老，在好萊塢似更來得顯明，雖然泰倫鮑華到現在還依然不失爲太太小姐一類的影迷們的「大情人」，然而像一年中主演三部鉅片（「支加哥大火記」「樂府滄桑」「蘇彝士」）的殊榮，以後怕將輪到李却葛林或他後一代的身上了。</p>
<p>同樣，好萊塢在最近的競攝彩色片，也說明了它的「日新月異」。彩色片的有取黑白影片而代之之勢，這固然是由於似默片而有聲片似的必然的進步，但刺激它進步的則是無綫電傳影的發明。據傳聞，立體電影也已經由一位攝影師發明，並且已山狄娜竇萍在開拍了。好萊塢（「日新月異」的花樣翻新，瞬息萬變，那也正說明了幾年之中好萊塢的「風流小生」由勞勃泰勒傳到李却葛林的第三代，是並非無因的。</p>
<p>談到「香妹寳馬」的影片，則我們很容易連想到「羅密歐與朱麗葉」，固然，在文學的價値上，是相去殊遠的，但戀愛消除世仇，這一點上，則是相同的。「香妹寶馬」的故事是說一八六一年美國南北戰爭時因政見不同的狄龍和高溫結下的寃仇，傳到了他們的後代還未消除，最後則因爲傑克狄龍的和莎莉高溫相愛而把寃仇解除。片子的素材用到很多豢馬賽馬。春郊試馬，這在彩色片中是很漂亮的書面，「香姝寳馬」的攝五彩片，它的命運大槪是決定在這些馬匹上的。</p>
<p>看了「香姝寳馬」，我們有些怎樣的印象和感想呢？也許是我連想到太遠，太荒唐，我是想到我們的國共合作的，由於傑克狄龍的訓練高溫家的「藍草」（馬名）勝利了，這說明了合作的利益，一種精誠合作的結果，這使人想到國共合作在這次聖戰中的任務和必然勝利。固然這也許會有人說是連想得太荒誕，但作爲拋除成見和宿仇的合作的重要說明，則這張「香妹寳馬」是有使人連想到這點的契機的。</p>
<p>導演者並不十分高强，「爲藝術而藝術」的切開來看，則在的翰狄龍槍殺塔第高溫那一塲戲的處理是不壞的，從塔第的被槍殺，到幼時的彼得高溫追着的翰狄龍的馬邊哭邊駡，那氣氛抓得很緊，演幼年彼得高溫的鮑拔華德生也演得很好；但以整個戲來看，則我是不歡喜這樣的處理的，他把仇恨種得太深了，使以後的解除宿怨成爲傑克和莎莉的少不更事。固然這種頭重脚輕的毛病是由於力不從心，不能把後面幾塲戲處理得好的緣故，但觀衆的印象，則總如此。</p>
<p>洛麗泰陽演得不壞，李却葛林則我喜歡他在出塲時的幾塲戲，有點靑年的朝氣，到後來，那種「風流小生」的樣子，頗使我想到上海舞塲裹常看到的洋塲遺少，便不歡喜了。演幼年彼得的鮑拔華德生和老年的彼得的華爾德皮南，則很好。</p>
<h3>生活報告　書店裏不准看書</h3>
<p>— （由）</p>
<p>在書店當過三年多練習生的我，月薪仍是區區的三元，每天日間應付門市，晚上理書和配書，要到十一時以後，才能休息；對於學業，一些空閑的時候也沒有，來求進步，所以在日間門市的時候，想借稍空的機會，來看上幾本有益的書籍，然不料反遭經理的怒責和痛駡，昨天我也因看書的原因，被經理開除了，而走向失業的路途。</p>
<p>理由是這樣的，據一位同事告訴我說：「經理是呌我們來做生意的，讀書那是該到學校裏去。並且，你看書，人家看起來，那像什麼樣子，沒有商家的規矩！」</p>
<p>他又繼續告訴我：「晚上想把書—擺在門市部的書——借去看，也不能够的，因爲經理看到會寃枉你偸。」</p>
<p>實在這種寃枉是有的，前幾天有一個同事，被開除的情形，就和這相仿，他犯着同我差不多的毛病，因爲得不到環境的許可，有時只好做出「不規矩」的事情來。</p>
<p>所謂「不規矩」的事情，就是在晚上關店門的時候，他總要偸摸了二三本刋物，帶到臥室裏去看，到第二天早上，又偸偸摸摸的放回去：這本來並沒有給他們什麼損害，可是被經理或他御用的眼錢看到了，那就要你滾蛋！</p>
<p>這事情發生之後，我曾有過一個小小的疑問，就是當他開除了，別的練習生並不見得奇怪；而被開除的那人，當離別的時候，告訴我們說：「朋友！遲早一點，你們也要被開除的。」以後我對於這件事，每天都回旋在我的腦際，疑懷着：難道他還另外犯有不法的事情嗎？</p>
<p>昨天我果然犯了同樣的「過失」，被經理召去談話，結果得到了滾蛋的命令，於是我索性放大了膽，和他辯駁，而得到的是「書店裏不准看書」的理由。</p>
<p>數年來的實踐，我了解了，書店一樣是一種卑汚的商店，牠虛負着提倡文化的美名，而實際上幹牠出賣靈魂的勾當。（當然良好的書店是例外的）肉威淫書銷路好，就賣肉戚淫書，有津貼就發行民衆有益的刋物，老闆的陰謀是誰也識不破的。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回　是幻是眞逢塲作戲　宜行宜止到處爲家</p>
<p>吳君素却是獨借了一屋，她雖是蘇州人，但她們的大家庭，却住在上海。她現在這一所屋子，是她們姊妹兩人合住的。因爲她有一位妹妹，名字喚做吳君可，現在還肄業於東吳大學中，姊妹兩人，正好合賃一屋。吳君素是喜歡熱鬧的，而且愛好友朋，規在對於何家兩位小姐，一見傾心，分外投契。所以她特地邀她們到自已屋子裏來，掃榻以待。當朱愛人等的汽車，聞到她門前的時候，她已在家裹，等候她們多時了。她不但是等候她們三人，她還等候着從上海來的金澹雲。朱愛人等到了她屋子裹，又見了她的妹妹吳君可。這位妹妹，比了君素還小五歲。她是東吳大學的理化科高才生，到明年就要畢業了。面型也和吳君素差不多，就只身量比她姊姊高，是個健美的靑年，她在學校裹的女子球賽上，很是冠羣出衆的。這位妹妹，朱愛人已是見過的了，何家兩位小姐却是初見。她們這屋子雖然不大，却是收拾得很精緻。樓下一間，算是個會客間，安置些沙發椅之類，此外便是君素的一架鋼琴，這是她的癖好，而且也是名手。像她的妹妹君可，雖然的略有些兒知道，便不及乃姊了。今天這幾位小姐中，只有何雙玉與吳君素兩人是同嗜，也算兩人是知音。因爲雙玉在美國的時候，也曾研究過的，不過雙玉也算不得是個批雅娜的專家呀。二層樓是她們姊妹兩人的房。近來因爲招待客人，她們把二層樓讓出，自己搬到一個亭子問裏去住。三層樓本來是她們的書房，又是她們的藏書樓，她們並不雇用女傭，屋子裏的事，都是自己親自操作。吃飯這裹有公共餐室，不必在家裏吃，省了許多麻煩的事。倘然有雜差等事，也有公共服役的人。朱愛人等來了還不到半個鐘頭，只聽得門外笑語喧譁，便是金澹雲來了。金澹雲從前到過吳君素家裹，因此比較熟悉，而在學校中，她也認得許多人，還有老同學在裏面。今天澹雲也是乘坐了火車來的。雖然蘇滬之間，現在有種種的交通機關，到底還是火車，最爲便捷。到了火車站，她雇了輛小汽車來了。（九一）</p>

<h3>好萊塢影星擇偶的標準</h3>
<p>— 春旭</p>
<p>有個法國記者曾特地往好萊塢去徵詢當地男女星們選擇對象的條件，（按：這是單指容貌，身體，品性而言，其他條件如財產，職業，學間等都撇開不談）。</p>
<p>據男星們的意見是：</p>
<p>（一）他們愛金栗色髮的女子，因這種女子大概美麗的居多，</p>
<p>（二）他們崇拜瘦的女子，（當然不是指骨瘦如柴，弱不禁風的女子），充滿曲錢美，女體育家典型的女子，並非是他們理想的配偶，好萊塢有句流行的俗語道：「曲錢並不是從一點至另一點最短的路程，所以這不是一條有趣的綫」這句話便十足表示他們厭惡肌肉肥滿的程度了。</p>
<p>（三）他們愛快樂，善笑，活潑，略帶傻性的女人。因爲娶了這種女子，在日常生活上能使丈夫容易得到安慰，忘却工作的辛勞，反之，若是娶了一位終日悲愁的婦人，便無異在家中安放一雙製造煩惱和悲劇的機器。</p>
<p>據女星們擇夫的意見是：</p>
<p>（一）她們愛嫁給棕色髮的男性，因爲美國大多數男性的頭髮却是棕色的。黑色和深色頭髮的男性不能受她們的歡迎，因爲太深色頭髮，使人面部顯出不溫柔的樣子。</p>
<p>（二）她們愛長脚淸瘦的男子。</p>
<p>（三）她們愛態度自然，不愛拘束，善說笑話，含有英雄氣概的男子，沉默寡言，英國紳士派的男人，是她們認爲最無味的東西。</p>

<h3>播音圈裏的花花絮絮（三）</h3>
<p>— 筆花</p>
<p>（接三月卅一日，筆者臥病多日，以致續稿久延，請讀者原諒。）</p>
<p>沙不器在幾年前曾經辦過小型報紙，他的口才在小報界裏的確是聞名的，談鋒甚健，滔滔不絕，宜乎他跑上電臺，播送話劇，受人歡迎。可惜他不知怎的在空氣中替自己做廣告，目的是替人看相和批命，顧此失彼，對於他固有的業務——話劇，難免分心，受着影響了。</p>
<p>陳萍倩是話劇從業員，當然，自有相當的經騐，斵輪老手，確是不凡，常話劇全盛時代，他在已故話劇鉅子鄭正秋領導之下，也是一員健將，近來也過其播音生活，因爲學有根柢，所以能在播音圈裏混到現在，確不容易。</p>
<p>紀範三出身是唱話劇，曾經拍過電影，大個兒的塊頭，會做出小姑娘的聲音，歷久不敗，屹然未動，在話劇播音中也佔着相當地位。</p>
<p>王涯遊的話劇，在電台上可稱聲勢最大，節目最多，惜乎所播話劇，太覺陳腐，如能變更宗旨，向時代方面找資料，再加煊染，一定生色不少。</p>
<p>顧醒憑顧玉蓮父女倆的話劇，歷史悠久，認眞從事，頗受聽衆歡迎，最好能够再翻些新花樣。</p>
<p>其餘如徐淸風，沈朔風，袁知非等，都是電台上播送話劇的傑出人材。筆者以爲電台上的話劇，近乎千篇一律，大同小異，如能從事整頓，把劇本改革起來，那麼聽衆們一定表同情的，如果長此下去，不求改造，聽衆日久生厭，恐怕難受人歡迎吧。</p>
<h3>「賣花女」西文名字的原義</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>幽默大師蕭伯納編寫的「賣花女」Pygmalion終於在本市的國泰大戲院上映了。無論從那一方面看來，我們都可以知道這一張片子一定會引起一般人的注意。此片情節之奧妙，對白之輕鬆愉快，演員搭配之整齊，均堪稱爲上臻。在這裏，且讓我來挪一賣花女一的西文名字所以稱爲Pygmalion的原義申說一番，以貢獻給諸位讀者吧。</p>
<p>按Pygmalion原是古時候Cyprus島（位於地中海的東部）上的一個王子，曾雕刻有一座極美麗，極精細的象牙女像，後來日子漸久，王子因愛慕此座牙像，以致終日終夜心神不安，坐臥不定，不得已乃求Aphrodite愛神，請將該座牙像變成活生生的「人」，愛神見其戀愛心切，故允其所求；是時，Pygmalion即與此女子結婚而成功了一段美滿的姻緣。</p>
<p>依上所述，王子愛慕牙像，愛神將牙像變成活人……等等，大概也都是所謂「神話」了。在「賣花女」中，Higglins即是Pygmalion的化身，賣花女Eliza即是此牙像的化身，不過所不同者，就只是Higgins亦不愛上Eliza，郤只預備與Eliza結爲好友而已</p>
<h3>上海銀行京劇社綵排參觀記</h3>
<p>— 吠聲</p>
<p>上海銀行同人京劇社第二次小綵排之期，筆者承該社沈君之招，得興觀光，茲將觀後所得，略記如次：綵排時問，於午後七時半開始，筆者因他事　遲，故至時羅成呌關已成尾聲，繼之者爲法門寺，原定爲朱再岑君之劉瑾，當以朱君偶患胃病，不克登台，臨時改由惲葆丞君庖代，工架老當，說白淸晰而流俐，洵非深得個中三昧者不辦。徐醉霞小姐之宋巧妓，亦頗不弱，最難能而可貴者，當推區鴻翔君之趙廉，字正腔圓之外，神情亦能充分表現，以初次登台之粵人（區君爲廣東籍），竟有如此成績，殊非意料所及，倘再努力於劇藝，則將來躋於名票之列者，可預卜也。次爲打鼓駡曹，吳照南君飾曹操，魁梧奇偉，碩大聲宏，兼而有之，盛宗才君飾彌衡，溫文儒雅，不愧書生本色，而一種鬱鬱不得志之神情，尤能表諸眉宇，擊鼓一塲，更見精彩。最後爲四郞探母，杜泰然君之楊延輝，嗓昔之佳，爲全社冠。坐宮時之大段西皮，極盡委婉曲折之致，周孫秀女士飾公主，扮相典　，儀態大方，大段西皮，歌來亦娓娓動聽。沈曉湖小姐之蕭后，頗具芙蓉草之作風，無怪博得滿堂彩聲。沈慕達君之宗保，扮相極佳，咬字正確，要腔及亮相，均純熟如老於此道者，惜病嗓瘠耳·鄒賓吉君之六郞·處處均合準繩·惜打鼓老臨時打錯點子，以致親自下座與四郞鬆刑之際，臨時忘詞，此殆初吹登台，顧此失彼之所致。不足爲疵，石秉庸君之太君，臉上有戲，爲全劇生色不少，周思忠君飾小番，爲了避免小鬍子被台下看出計，勾了一臉嘴的黑色，引得台下鬨堂大笑，亦趣事也。最足使人欽羨者，厥爲該社之合作精神，如社長游伯羣君與濮恩犖君在是劇中分飾關官，劇務主任陳寳德君，於主演南天門後，即連飾數劇之龍套。共不分階級，團結合作之精神有如此者，故樂爲記之如上。聞該社尚擬定期舉行公開演劇賑難，是則，寓娛樂於慈善，誠有足多者矣。</p>

<h3>觀中國歷代書畫展覽會後（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳蝶野</p>
<p>劉海粟自稱藝術叛徒，四十以後，乃拚命收中國畫，其天性筆觸，皆近石濤八大，然會所列則以倪元璐一卷爲最佳。海粟嘗得黃石磨松卷，足興此爲合璧，何以不並陳也？石濤大幅似重經着色者，仍舊貫，如之何？</p>
<p>徐邦達收藏之精，不减葱玉，然葱玉爲藏家，而邦達爲畫家。邦達工畫，故其所收，又與葱玉有別。若山樵之冬靑館圖，張渥之九歌，董玄宰之山水卷，皆足知其眼力與工夫兼到處，與漫然博愛者別是一種風格。而孫艾木棉一圖，純是對花寫生，高雅別致，以視石濤黃牡丹大有仙凡之別。</p>
<p>黃黃樓所藏九峯雪霧圖，明淸以來迭見著錄，　臣虎惲香山似皆從此出，今觀眞迹，或朱得爲子久甲觀。然子久畫，已歸天上，人間有一角存者，已如麟風，况巋然六尺，完整無缺者耶？黃樓無惜精英，公之衆覽，功德可謂無量，以視懷璧床頭，閉戶不出者，豈可同日語耶？若文徵明徐渭海瑞李騰芳黃道周諸家書迹，皆黃樓所出者也，尤獲我心。程孟陽秋林策杖圖，亦足爲會中九友祭酒，若馬遠一幅，則明人盡耳。</p>
<p>潘博山藏方從義溪橋幽興與林爾卿藏郭畀仿高米雲山，同爲元人雙絕，而方　高古，尤勝郭卷，予觀之，蓋半小時不能去云，博山家藏法書甚多，而茲會所出則甚少，使人不無倦然。</p>
<p>王季銓藏王蒙林麓幽居，較邦達之冬靑館圖精神小遜，然亦難得。陳洪綬山鳥梅花，拙然古意。季銓富收藏而所出特少，使予望之，興博山同一感念。</p>
<p>蝶巢之倪雲林綠水圖，周雨靑之吳小　　湖晚眺，朱屺瞻之孫克弘山寺烟霧，徐俊卿之項聖謨雪景山水，孫邦瑞之王石谷寒塘　　，亦皆精品。予於茲會有不能無憾者三，文沈唐仇無代表作品一也。四王吳惲不饜所望二也。朱盡多濫竽，乾嘉以後，不能割愛三也。希望者一，向來收藏家多不肯以其收藏精品，公開陳列，非有鄙吝，誠以陳列者多鹵莽，不知愛惜，一經展掛，表池往往遭汚，欲加重裝，則屢裝損盡之精神，仟其狼藉，則心有不怡，故往往以中品塞資。獨此次陳列，多出邦達慘澹經營，非但一展一拂，十分愛惜，於盡人年代，尤能位置井然，非胸有舉問，焉能至此？收藏者對此，可以色然而喜矣。後來繼作，爭出所藏，飽人眼福，可預卜矣。</p>
<p>更正　昨日本文第十三行「華蘇小妹圓」「華」係「夢」之誤。</p>

<h3>金融　現金津幫多頭了結</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、變動範圍稍有擴大、情勢則呈先略漲而後跌、初開因某銀樓代客吸購、礦遂昂達二千〇七十七元、旋因證券幫代津幫將上週六所進之多頭均來脫售、且某銀號亦跟蹤拋塞、加以買者納胃不健、市勢頓疲、延至午時價竟跌入七十元關內、退達二千〇六十九元收盤、下午　勢稍穩、聞買方七十元已肯吸收、但售者賣意轉淡、須七十一二元方肯脫手之說、結果若照上日午收軋跌六元、上午交易尚旺、約七百兩光景、下午未有做開、銀樓飾金亦疲落一元、海關金仍平、中英純金等復向上升、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市跌六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因某銀樓代客吸購、形勢尚穩、九時四十分首見某銀樓進某錢兌業代天津幫出共百兩、二千〇七十七元為開盤價、較之前收做高二元、開後證券幫亦代天津幫大量吐售、因之潛勢頓轉下疲、證券幫賣予銀樓幫五十兩、價與晨開相同、繼之又售予某銀號五十兩、價七十五元、後再吐售某銀樓五十兩、價七十四元、其時買者漸少、故跌風加厲、證券幫又塞予銀樓幫五十兩、價七十一元、後某銀號代客幫塞予某銀樓一百三十兩、價七十元、俄即某銀號原價復進銀樓幫五十兩、此後證券幫又賣予某錢莊五十兩、價亦七十元、相同價金號亦賣予錢兌業五十兩、近午銀樓幫賣予錢兌業五十兩、六十九元為午收價、午後市況沉寂、供求均稀、後某錢兌業忽想吸購、喊價七十元、但賣戶均懷觀望、直至四時後仍未獲對手、致無做開、若照午收二千〇六十九元、結果則較隔昨晚收軋跌六元、全天八元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇七十五元、收進二千〇六十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金掛小一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十時十分、因烚赤下疲、已退達七十元關口、故亦掛小一元、大同行改懸二百十元、新同行為二百〇八元、收進二百〇二元、</p>
<p>英鎊仍疲純金回升</p>
<p>十九日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊潛勢仍疲、故復向上升、每盎司回漲半辦士、計昂達七鎊八先令六辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價、亦回升至二千二百十二玩六角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨漲三角、計一千二百〇七元八角、</p>

<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、續稍高昂每千元初仍站四十八元二角半、下午求者較旺、一度高達四十八元七角半、最後回至四十八元半、比上日略高二角半、</p>
<h3>遠期美匯　交易續盛　歐陸危機潛伏　日行暗中猛結</h3>
<p>匯市昨雖各大洋行等頻來扒結、但因英美銀行界競相供塞、且錢兌業亦來拋塞美金、是以狀況愈形穩定、結果仍平、交易頗旺、而美匯期貨買賣、亦頗不寂、蓋邇來歐局稍形緩和、但危機依然潛伏、故日銀行暗中傾扒、幸賴外行供意者仍無興趣、良以現貨與七月份、三個月掉期、僅差美金一二五、按月利息連傭金僅為四厘左右、太少故也、至港匯華行互做居多、且錢兌業亦稍有吐售、故潛勢愈穩、結果亦平、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均平、紐約銀價呆定如故、倫敦生金大半便士、匯兌英對美小三毫、對滬對法均平、美對英對滬亦均未更動、對法跌〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十五元〇六二五、較之前收均平、開後洋行雖扒、但以外行供意亦佳、至鮮變化、洋行結進某行、美匯十六元〇六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡揭曉亦無升降、仍徵百分之五·二五、此後洋行又購結匯豐麥加利英匯八便士二五、繼之外行有利雖代日銀行界扒結遠期美匯、唯因銀行賣意仍佳、是以潛勢頗穩、有利結進外行如華比等六月份美匯十六元、並七月份美匯十五元九三七五、午刻成交較寂、略有港匯買賣、華行互做港匯五十六元、為狀亦平、迨午收銀行賣價、與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市洋行續來扒進、匯豐英匯八便士二五、後錢兌業突來傾塞美金、但外行與華行等趁賤則扒、故情勢愈穩、錢兌業塞予外行華比·荷蘭·及華行等、美匯十六元〇九三七五、入後華行又互做港匯五十六元、繼之外行賣予錢兌業港匯五十五元八七五、為狀略軟、迨晚收銀行賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、港匯五十六元、結果較之隔昨晚收、英美港三匯、均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>外幣堅定者多</h3>
<p>昨日英純金漲半辦士、英美匯兌未動、本埠外匯、洋行結款甚般、外銀行供給尚盛、市價無變動、穩定如前、烚赤開盤微堅、客幫稍起收納、金號等供給未暢、未幾錢兌業銀樓業紛起拋塞、客幫需要已稀、客戶納胃又呆、市價軟弱、下午市況呆滯、交易未做開、外幣英美金鎊、需要未盛、英金票、外銀行吸納稍暢、價微堅挺、美金票需要仍旺、供給頗暢、價微回降、法郎票澳金票供給稍弱、價略上升、公會交易稀少、僅寶祥出祥康進香港票六百元、恒茂出新泰進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金票升三分、美金票降二厘、法郎票升二毫半、澳金票升五分、其他各幫、俱無更動、</p>
<p>印銀微長大條平</p>

<h3>津港匯兌均跌</h3>
<p>（天津）二十日電、匯兌行市與上日比較、英匯放長〇九三七五、美匯放長一八七五、申匯跌一元、茲將上午開盤市價列後、</p>

<h3>天津偽「鈔」　合法幣八角半</h3>
<p>天津二十日電、偽「聯銀券」暗盤市價、上午開盤與十九日上午開盤比較、計貴六元、價為一百十七元五角、（係法幣百元之價即「聯銀券」一元、值法幣八角五分）、</p>
<h3>證券　公債已成長俏短疲局面　統申昨達六十三元　倫敦外債跌多漲少</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨趨勢雖尚有徘徊、漲風實已堪稱穩定、甲種曾一度漲達六十三元最近新高價、丙丁戊三種亦皆衝出五十三元、形勢極為堅挺、腳跟立定、此後趨勢當有更堅穩之漲風、空方因迭受刺激、已有把持不定之象、但一般逢高放空者、仍頗不乏人、枱面搶帽交易、搶多頭帽子者居多、此亦可覘一部份之人心、長多短空、已為普通的口號、環境利多、人心極佳、現甲種已接近一月十日之高價、昨日經過、上午開盤、德孚及同順買進最湧、丙丁戊三種頃刻衝出五十三元關、甲種亦見六十三元、大豐裕濟永康大通均有進胃或補空、賣方雖有興元承康長和等號、但仍求過於供、後以天生樂茂及四十一號等奮勇傾吐、市價乃受壓迫、餘多忐忑、隨眾脫手、但結果仍好起二三角、午後消息頓佳、協大首先踴躍收買、德孚信豐永亦有大量需要、散戶又起補空、市價再高、賣方雖有、但已不惹人注目、一般隨後逐流者疲於奔命、故午後又回高數角、趨勢極佳、收盤後並有廣州克復已近、人心更堅、市價結果、比前日續好五角至八角、成交總數共計約二百元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股一百五十股、價為六元四角、</p>
<p>眾業公所報告雲、以全日交易計、會德豐與怡和二項股票最為活躍、需求甚殷、會德豐漲至卅五元二角五分、怡和股重見有多數買戶、出價廿元、瑞镕普通股先弱後漲、由六元六角高至六元八角、橡皮股內橡皮原料價格上漲、以致買戶較多、惟出價低廉、故成交不多、公司債券市面暗淡、而中國營業公司八厘債券成交五十五兩、聞該公司即行改組、如何計設、信意者均昂首以待、</p>
<p>本埠麥邊洋行經理之上海司買得橡皮有限公司、昨經董事會公表、截至一九三八年十月底止、一年間之營業狀況、計盈國幣六四、〇五〇·四七元、除分派股息每股國幣二角、共計國幣一五、三九一·二〇元外、並提法定公積金國幣一四、三九〇·〇〇元、並開除各項折舊捐款等費國幣三、九五〇·〇〇元、勝餘國幣三〇、三一九·二七元、滾入下屆、並息本屆股東大會定於五月九日舉行雲、</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月十九日（星期三）掛牌行市、平定無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦國外幣債券、本月十九日（星期三）掛牌行市、跌多漲少、英德續借款英發債票、昨日回升半鎊後、本日重見跌落、價格仍為六十四鎊、善後借款英發債票及湖廣鐵路公債非德發債票亦各跌半鎊、前者價為五十鎊半、後者價為二十二鎊、道清鐵路公債跌落一鎊、價為二十一鎊、隴海鐵路公債有印債票則微升五先令、價為十七鎊十五先令、其餘均無變動、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油　買氣重振　市價又見新紀錄</h3>
<p>生豆油市況、殊難下墜實因各路銷場、全由本市一處供應、故業中逢低即進、日商認清目標、施以操縱手段、頗能應呼裕如、昨日晨初、承上日餘風、仍見軟勢、但轉瞬買氣洋溢、供不應求、行情頻頻上提、又見新紀錄、統市計開膠州花生油八十件、價為三十九無至三十九元五角、大連現桶豆油成交三百餘桶、價自四十元三角半漲至四十五元、白絞油開出五十桶、價為四十九元及四十八元二角半、連岐大簍五十件（四十二元八角、煙岐成交一百六十件、三十三元五角至三十四元、膠州豆油一百件、三十二元六角、</p>
<h3>豆餅投機狂勢　成交數量激增　行情反動上升</h3>
<p>昨日大連豆餅、反動上漲、蓋因投機狂熱、成交數激增、期現市價、一致轉升、現餅較上日市面升五分、做開五千片、價自二元八角二分、步升至八角五分、訂五月份期貨漲一角四分、成交二萬片、價為二元八角八分半至三元、訂六月訂交做開二萬餘片、價自二元九角七分半開盤、步提至三元一角、比前市漲起一角三分、但在收盤時、賣氣見盛、聞三元零八分、猶無人問津、</p>
<p>豆子於二十一日、運汕頭三百八十包、運香港六百十包、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市頗似拉鋸式　寶銷轉滯浮多續吐　大戶維持再吸棧單</h3>
<p>紗市始疲繼回、結果行市參差不齊、蓋以實需較昔為滯、香港雲南兩幫雖有採辦、然吃量甚為淺薄、不及前幾日之爽健、潮汕採辦停頓、故有一部份浮多照市脫售、市象轉弱、但多方因現貨根子未見十分松懈、意態仍屬挺進、於此殆呈拉鋸式之市面矣、後市同業某某等復來活動、將　單貨收進幾百包、買氣頓昂、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市氣平疲、相延至十時尚未開盤、實則客銷不湧、各方納胃不暢、且一般派到門票現貨之戶、鑒於現貨生意滯鈍、求售之念尤急、開價即小去一元、二十支雙馬紗價為四百〇一元、但入後需要依然零落而不興旺、且客幫動辦殊鮮、市價徐徐下挫、二十支雙馬現貨價敲破四百元關門、為三百九十九元半、棧單價為三百九十三元半、惟十支粗紗非但不墜、反見前進、三十二支·四十二支亦保持平穩之境、午後同行某某等因棧單價格廉、突來搜羅、約進二三百包、枱面頓見緊張、立刻閧起二元、為三百九十五元半至六元、現貨隨之帶升、收盤價為四百〇二元、結果行情二十支　女小一元、雙馬勿動特全城跌二元半、十支粗紗再漲二元光景、查全日各幫買去統計一千一百四十包、廠方由永安廠開出十支特金城三百包、價為三百三十八元、六月至八月期、今日出口棉紗有四百十件運天津、八十件運煙臺、九百十件運汕頭、一千零二十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去成交之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>粗紗交易良好　印棉廠辦不絕</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市因五月份軋空關係、三日來猛漲二十餘磅音、遠期因此稍被帶上若幹、昨日形勢較為緩和、五月份雖回漲五磅音、其他月份反見小三五磅音、華盛頓方面對於將來之棉業政策、尚無確切消息、美棉輪出數字未見起色、布疋銷路殊為呆滯、蓋因與棉業有關者、均抱觀望態度、昨日印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、折合法幣計美棉及巴西棉漲四角、印棉跌四角、埃及跌一元餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各廠略有小額交易、唯以平果兒為大宗、蓋因粗紗交易較盛、及姚花不能運滬銷售故也、白洛區次之、彭加浦交易稀少、昨日計鴻章進白洛區三百包、安達進平果兒五百包、德豐進平果兒一千包、其他各廠無交易、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價錄下、</p>
<p>本棉市況、與上日不相上下、售價無甚軒輊、生意仍以德豐廠稍有辦胃、然額量微乎其微、其他廠家絕無動辦之象、同業中買賣亦寥若晟星、各路來源受種種之牽制、殊感缺乏、惟河下火機花有到三四船、約計七八百包、（每包計一百二十斤）蘇北一帶因局勢不靖、到貨通僅六十六包、今日出口有三十件運汕頭、五十件運香港、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經外銷再度旺盛　白廠開一千八百元高盤</h3>
<p>國外絲市、紐約裏昂昨再報漲、日絲八三分·七五份各漲四分、交易所近期漲八分半、遠期漲半分、裏昂日絲漲二法郎、上海絲漲一至一法郎半、僅橫濱絲價、現貨呆售原盤遠期下跌二十七元、以美漲日跌之昨日絲市觀之、最近絲價漲風、似已臻最高限度、美市昨日獨見堅俏、當為投機軋空所致、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、昨外銷再度旺盛、達昌怡和均接有大額來賬、白廠七八分做開一七九〇元-一八〇〇元高昂盤子、成交額計達三四百擔、為數度絲價騰漲聲中所僅見之現象、按昨日售盤、已較三日前（本週一）飛升一〇〇元、橫濱現貨在此四日中、則僅漲起六十五元、故此次申市堪稱價昂交盛、一改往昔「坐失良機」之舊態、堪稱絲市經營之新紀元、</p>
<h3>糧食　津地雜紛充斥　本粉北銷受阻</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨本廠現粉交易、殊見呆頓、查客幫銷場、開續告清閑、北洋幫以天津申匯猛降、販運頗不合算、且當地亦受雜牌洋粉充斥之影響、致申粉北銷頓受阻礙、南洋幫亦以前辦之貨、尚未裝清、新交易難以開展、致市面平淡無神、各廠對於客盤、本有削價之意、但因客銷既靜、洋粉市價、亦未肯松、故亦無遷就之必要、結果二號粉廠盤仍守四元四角半之原盤、聞回　貨續有小去五分者、不作正市論、統市成交除本街零批約有七千包外、查今日麵粉出口有十萬零八百包、運往天津、又三萬三千七百包、運汕頭、又四千五百包、運煙臺、</p>
<p>洋粉　日昨洋粉市態、漸趨冷淡、據國外來電、麥價已見報小、而遠期洋粉定價、依然不通、所以勢貨者一味堅持、尚不遷就、惟本街進胃已飽、北洋幫更以匯水不劃、及當地洋粉充斥、對於申粉及洋粉、概鮮垂青、致市上供求兩寂、買賣互持、聞中檔牌子售價仍須四元二角至一角半現鈔、僅零星點綴交易而已、</p>
<h3>杜粳客銷路俱清　天氣悶熱米易變化　高次貨回小一二角</h3>
<p>昨日各幫來源河下未到、車輪包子僅蘇同幫二千餘包、天氣悶熱、米質易起變化、致本街及囤戶胃口均呆、全市交易寥寥、各貨大都未能售開、際此回　貨頗多相軋之下、市面遂呈現下垂、若厚粳價貶落一角至角外、薄稻亦降幾分至一角、杜洋尖埠尖難立足、同低角許、變元乏人問津、是以市面反無進出、</p>
<p>客　邇日雖乏整批到埠、然零批小票續由車輪裝到、而滬棧存底既充、客化久滯、行囤進竟尤淡、市乃日下、且浮囤散戶均圖脫手、昨市中次客　立見猛落二角、高貨亦小角外、蕪湖　祇開十二元七角、次至十二元左右、而中關　米僅十一元二三角、統市成交仍祇一千包以外、惟洋米存底日枯、新定不劃、貨方減價不肯過松雲、</p>
<h3>疋頭　川幫添辦色布　數量較夥　東疋交易寥落</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>趨　穩定、各路實銷不旺、惟仍源源不絕、重慶幫添辦色布色斜、數量較夥、綜計五六千疋、汕頭幫添辦色斜·府綢·色布六十餘箱、溫州幫辦白貨·粗布最多、成交十三·十四·十六磅各牌一百數十包、而本街囤戶拖進怡和粗布輕重磅各檔又達四百餘包、故粗布售盤續堅、較上日每疋漲五分之譜、細布·細斜因各華廠承織坯布、產量均已減少、市上存底單薄、交易雖稀、市盤堅挺、昨蘇北及染廠購辦百餘包、粵幫辦細布三十包、囤戶擇申新新裕永安三紡織廠出品細布·細斜繼續搜購、成交百餘包、該三廠出品售盤特佳、每疋續漲五分至一角、漂染布疋、售盤平定、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>細布·細斜繼續疲滯、晨市每疋跌一角、後市略見回升、結果較前日挫落五分左右、客幫交易寥若晨星、本街同業及染廠續辦五六百件、市情於松弛中、仍尚堅穩、伊籐洋行收進十二磅龍頭細布二百餘包、每疋價係自十三元到十三元〇五分、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭於二十一日運天津二百八十件、運煙臺三百五十件、運汕頭二百件、運香港三百三十件、</p>
<p>萬立頂當令暢銷</p>
<p>萬立頂邇巴紛紛上市、因寶銷及時、本街上一般西服裁縫幫、俱有購辦、元常棕灰及純白米色等、走銷均廣、尤以藏青與淡灰顏色、需要更殷、標準市價、西貨成本高大、行情自亦較之去年、高昂多多、昨美臣蓮花公主成交價為八元淨盤、好時牌子七元一角、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青漲二三角</h3>
<p>昨粗白略緊、公會劃盤、二十四號本棧現貨二十六元三角半、成交五十包、轉口貨十八元二角至一角半、成交四百餘包、太古車白呌升五分、西棧現貨為二十六元二角、國糖僅開出高黃崗青十五元三角、普通綿赤十五元一二角、共成交百數包、二十日有糖二百包自汕頭來、（前日片青開價為十元誤刊十一元附此更正）、</p>
<h3>藥材　百合片　汕港去路俱暢</h3>
<p>百合片前以港幫動辦不輟、市勢頗形堅定、而刻下汕頭幫銷路又復活躍、致售價再緊、查產區存貨、已屬有限、而新貨登場、為期尚遠、如前日　幫欲辦、願出寥寥、較之前市、漲起二元、測諸行家、稍有底積　、似尚須扳守也、</p>
<h3>進出口　建太運到六千年</h3>
<p>其他尚有煙葉與皮油二十日進口、自福州來者、有煙葉一百八十件、土紙八千件、木板六千件、皮油二千件、土紙四千件、</p>

<h3>痧子咳嗽之順逆　與調護食養之關係</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>近日痧子流行，本刋自刋登『痧疹』稿件以來，大受讀者歡迎，故再講尤君續作數稿，以應讀者所望。（存仁識）</p>
<p>咳嗆爲痧子應有之證候，如咳聲不多，每間若干分鐘，作咳三四聲，咳而帶潤，呼吸調和，不妨礙其睡眠者，於康健上決無影響，於痧子之前途，亦決不致發生變化。咳嗆之生理作用，在排除呼吸系之障礙物，藉咳聲之迸發，驅出於體外；痧子咳嗆，且有輔助疹子透達之功能，苟不十分劇烈，有益而無害，不必投止咳之劑以消滅之。如咳嗆頻作，咳又不　，或則因多咳而致咽喉辣痛，聲音啞澀，或則因劇咳而致胃部震動，泛啞作吐，在情勢上似覺甚爲緊張，然疹子之透發，並不因此而發生變化，呼吸均勻，無短促喘急之狀者，調治得法，尚無大礙。若咳嗆而氣急鼻扇，痧後仍頻咳不已者，皆屬逆證，宜深加注意！</p>
<p>感冒足以致咳，故患痧子者，宜避風寒，然過於謹護，或以重被緊裹病兒，或於房中添置火爐，外熱內迫，喘而作咳者，所兇亦甚多。習俗以紅棗燃着，置於病兒房中　之，謂可備痧子之速達，不知濃烟迷漫，最易刺激氣道，加甚其咳嗆。常見居室之狹隘者，多人聚處，空氣已十分惡濁，入其室，往往頭暈欲嘔，若再薰以濃燜，爲和爲害，稍有常識之人，當能明辨，病兒咳嗆之劇者，益不宜採用此法。習俗；家中有發痧子者，烹飪時「不起油鑊」，即所以避免油味之刺激，防止咳嗆之加增也。</p>
<p>痧子之發生，多以感冒爲誘因，古方透痧子，用「葱頭煎湯，注入盆中，置病兒於上薰之」。此法亦可治感冒，類而推之，如痧子初起，兼患感冒而咳者，以葱頭數枚，拍碎，煮薄粥飲之，旣可解除感冒，亦能助痧子之外達，一舉而兩得也。若因熱而咳者，大多而紅氣促，脈象洪數，痧疹則密集而鮮紅甚艷，可用淸凉飮料，蔗漿，梨汁，皆爲合宜，視其熱勢之程度，而定冷飮與溫服，如以杏仁加水搗爛，取汁和飮，尤佳。熱甚則燥，津液耗灼，故因燥而咳者，乾咳不潤，兼見舌質光絳，投以甘凉之蔗漿梨汁，尤爲相宜。咳而多痰者，以袪痰爲要，萊菔搗汁，加姜汁三五滴溫服，如患痧子之小兒，大便溏泄，用時宜愼。咳而多痰者，不可多食油膩，在痧子前期，油膩固當禁止，即痧子後期，疹點已回，食慾驟增，其咳而多痰者，油膩之品，仍當禁止。</p>
<p>百日咳之症，小兒甚易患之，其咳有起伏性，伏時，一如常兒，毫無異狀，及起而作咳，即連咳不已，致面　筋綻，額汗涔涔，　綿難愈，往往延至三四月之久，其流行期與痧子同時，故輙與痧子併發，致咳嗆之勢加甚，咳甚則轉致肺炎，險象環生。單方用建蘭葉慈孝竹煎湯服，實則並無確實之效騐。余常用　　涎丸治之，病兒之服此者，能得咳聲爽利，每次作咳時間，可以較减，丸中有麻黃，於痧子亦具疏透之功力，即已有肺炎證象者，用之亦有利無害。習俗於咳嗽一症，多喜用甜潤之品，如冰糖蜂蜜之類，以治咳藥調和之，而百日咳之症，以宣肺爲要，甜而潤者，反不相宜。</p>
<p>痧子咳嗆，其最特異者，爲「得飲則嗆」一證，平時咳聲全無，如喂以乳，或飮以水，或投以藥汁，則咳聲連作，繼則復歸寂然，痧子而轉變肺炎者，往往有此種現象，俗謂痧子宜咳，不咳反爲逆證者，此即其一例也。見此證象者，大多胃呆不食，不必强與飮食，治肺炎平復，自得稀疏之咳聲，投以飮料，無「得飮則嗆」之現象，此時胃口亦起，方可談及飮食問題。若咳多而致音啞者，可用枇杷花蜜，每次冲服一匙，每日服二次；或用杏仁一兩，湯浸，去皮尖，以水一杯搗取汁，生紫苑半兩硏末，和入，與蜂蜜一杯，同煎成膏，每服半匙，淸粥飮調下。</p>
<p>久咳足以成癆，痧後諸證俱退，咳嗆亦逐漸消滅，如咳嗆繼續不巳，肢體消瘦，或見潮熱者，乃痧癆之的證，調治非易，食養方法，可用猪肺一具，淸水洗凈，加麥冬川貝百部紫苑地骨皮同煮飮之。</p>
<h3>大蒜殺蟲</h3>
<p>— 吳善慶</p>
<p>大蒜味辛氣溫，功能療疾，有豁痰止嗽開胃滌及利尿發汗之效。</p>
<p>惟其性辛熱，且有劇奧，不宜過食，過食則悶，蓋能衝動血液，善發焮熱，尤於陰虛之體爲甚。古人謂多食則昏目　神，良由於此。</p>
<p>凡寒性粘液質人之虛冷病症，食之往往有效，用作殺蟲之劑，尤爲特長，以其氣臭鑽透，增進腸壁蠕動，蟲受刺激，不能吸附於腸間，遂隨大便而排泄也。可取蒜頭細搓，用水或乳汁送下，或用乳汁煮服，或摻人飮食物中服之，以治諸藥罔效之蟲症，勝於苦寒之殺蟲藥。小兒如患蟲病，最宜服之。如不能內服，可將蒜頭搗爛如泥，貼臍及胃部，蟲亦自下。霍亂盛行時，食蒜可以防疫，又能淸滌大腸，常食可以預防盲腸炎。西　　力山丁即大蒜所製也</p>
<h3>七星鱧</h3>
<p>— 張懷霖</p>
<p>吃素太太所謂夜朝北斗之七星魚，書名鱧魚，俗稱黑魚，北方人稱之　魚，鱧魚色黑，大者重二斤餘，小者的斤許，首有七星；各移動物之膽，其味皆苦，獨鱧魚之膽則甜。</p>
<p>鱧魚性走而行水，肌肉壯實，食之可助消化，兼能行水生津。此物雖割殺不死，入鍋猶能跳躍。各處均產，故價極賤，遂不爲人所重視，中下之家，　以作羹佐餐。</p>
<p>鱧魚療水腫之疾有奇騐。嘗有一患水腫者得一方，以大禮魚一尾，葱白頭三十枚，薑一塊，半酒半水煮極爛，任病者食，自頭吃至尾者，腫上部先退，目尾吃至頭者，腫下部先退。屢試屢效。</p>
<p>鱧魚膽甜，可治喉痺之疾；多年喉痺，發時腫脹欲死，用此膽點之即活。病深者用水調灌之，入咽得生。</p>
<p>鱧魚體肥肉壯，食之令人易飽，强筋骨，長肌肉，能殺蟲，病後亦宜。可作油煎之爆魚，炊魚片湯，紅燒魚，魚羹等菜，與冬瓜同食，可利大小二便。</p>
<h3>荔枝</h3>
<p>— 國才</p>
<p>荔枝產福建廣東等地，皮色暗赤，有皺紋，其肉細膩潔白，柔滑而多汁，味之甘美，百果中無一可及。但此物不能多食，因其性頗熱，若食荔過度，易致發熱，煩渴，口乾，衂血等，此時可將荔枝殼浸水飮之即解。</p>
<p>荔枝小僅可作水果食，且其核殼等皆有治病之效；如婦人患血氣刺痛，小腸氣痛，心痛等各症，可以荔核一二枚煨存性研末，用酒調服。或與牛膝，補骨脂，延胡索，合歡子，茴香，木瓜，杜仲，橘核等同煎，能治疝氣；虛熱者加黃柏，虛寒者加肉桂。若囊腫如斗，以荔枝核，靑橘皮，茴香等分，各炒研酒服三錢，每日三服，極爲有效。</p>
<h3>懷孕保養宜愼　「漏紅」時啜地黃粥</h3>
<p>— 丁伯安</p>
<p>婦女生產，自受孕以迄臨盆，須經過十個月的時期，在此悠久之過程中，孕婦體內之血液須專供濡養胎兒，對於其他部份之榮養，自然無暇顧及，乃呈面色皎白，神倦力乏之象。同時抵抗能力亦隨之削弱，故懷孕之後，關於起居欽食，宜時刻謹愼注意。舉動方面，禁止舉高，抬物，負重，遠行，勞役等工作。食物方面，忌冬食酒，椒辣，　蒜等類辛熱之品，恐動胎氣，而致疾病。</p>
<p>「寗治十男子，莫醫一婦人。」此語蓋指婦女疾病隱情複雜，診斷時頗感困難，而診治姙娠疾病，尤費思索，一面須對症發藥，一面又不能不顧慮胎兒，苟病情上遇到兩者不能兼顧時，更爲棘手？「胎前實涼」，此語是治療經騐之談，言醫者治姙娠病時，用藥宜偏淸凉。蓋孕婦體質每多火重熱盛；淸凉藥物，大都有滋養生津之功效，適合其需要，而病易痊矣。</p>
<p>姙娠下血，謂之漏紅，即由血熱而來，用地黃粥療治，乃根據上項原理，生地汁能育陰，補血，凉血，止血，潤肺。粳米有補中和胃之效。法用粳米二合煮粥，生地汁四兩，臨熱加入，調勻，空腹時食。久之自可熱平血止，大有效益，米可因其平淡而忽視之。</p>
<h3>養生食品新食譜（三）</h3>
<p>— 倪息庵</p>
<p>（八）　脾粉（製法）用党參，黃芪，白术，茯苓，山藥，甘蓮子，炒苡仁，陳皮，杏仁，各等分，和入白粳米中，炒黃，磨成粉即得。食時，加適量白糖，用開水冲攪。（效用）味甘香而不苦，能補中健脾，化痰理氣，旺食增力，固精安神，爲病後調補妙品，對於畏服湯藥者，尤爲相宜。</p>
<p>（九）淸燉甲魚（製法）取不大不小之甲魚二三只，（太大則肉老，過小則無力，）刷凈苔穢，入鍋煮死，取出剖去甲壳，剔出腸血，只用凈肉，切成小塊，入生薑五七片，食鹽一匙，陳黃酒少許，寬湯用炭結火淸燉，至爛熟，即可取食。此物初燒時必發奇臭，及後愈煮愈香，雖　淸燉，味甚濃厚。（效用）此爲滋陰妙品，有益精同腎之功；患痔漏者，尤爲相宜。遺精亦效，但須胃納强盛者，方無膩滯。</p>
<p>（十）五豆湯　（製法）於夏季，取茶豆赤小荳各二份，黃大豆，黑豆，白扁豆各一份，合而煮湯，入白糖少許，加薄荷汁一匙，待少京飲之。（效用）能散暑化熱，淸心沁脾，利小便，祛脚氣，稀痘瘡，消痤疿，孕婦不忌，尤利小兒。</p>
<p>（十一）鍋巴飲（製法）覓大鍋飯釜底，純黃微　之鍋巴，晒燥，貯藏備用，用時加水煮之，待飯粒開花，始可取出。（效用）入口鬆爛焦香，非但不致積滯，且能健脾。病中充飢，助穀氣，病後調養，亦宜。（完）</p>
<h3>談談牛乳（中）</h3>
<p>— 丁濟民</p>
<p>牛乳性質是熱的，這是衆口一詞的說法，我們拿本草綱目上的記載看一看，自己也不免啞然失笑綱目上面明明說是『甘微寒』。『甘』是甜的意思，『微寒』是凉的意思。牛乳除了有一點腥味之外，確是有一些甜味。（至於『微寒』的寒字是關係中醫整個的藥理。所以在這裏，暫且不提）。現在就拿『甘微寒』幾個字的字面看起來，不是很明顯的說是不熱的了。（西醫的分析除了蛋白脂肪碳水化合灰分等質。及維他命外，並無寒熱之分）。那末牛乳究竟是性熱性寒的呢？讓我慢慢的說來。</p>
<p>我們每見鄕下人到上海，初坐電車汽車，大嘔大吐，狼藉滿地；想他們看別人站在車裏，自由自在，搖來恍去，從不跌倒，心中一定引爲奇事。然而我們出門，坐海船，想到暈船，其苦不堪；看見水手茶房們都是生龍活虎，毫無痛苦，眞是羡慕已極，其實毫不足怪，無非習慣而已。我們中國人數千年來，一向是閉關自守的，吃的是淸茶淡飯，蔬菜魚肉，腸胃裏面對於上述的幾樣東西，已消納得很慣常了。並且古人的目光，向來視牛乳爲野蠻人所吃的東西。醫如漢朝李陵給蘇武的信裏面有、「羶肉酪漿。以充飢渴」。又王昭君遠嫁匈奴的悲歌裏面有「穹廬爲寳兮氈爲墻。以肉爲食兮酪爲漿。」他們兩個人。吃了牛乳羊肉，都覺很不舒服，而發於詩文之中。所以在古代牛乳並不列入日常食養品裏面。我們唐代的名醫及食物療病家孫思邈氏，在他所著的千金翼方十二卷裏有一　議論。曰：「牛乳性平，補血脈，益心，長肌肉，令人身體康强潤澤，面目光悅，志氣不衰；故爲人子者，須供之以爲常食，一日弗　，常使咨意充足爲度也。此物勝肉遠矣」！雖然孫氏發表了這篇有經騐的議論，然而究竟敵不過古代中國人的尊王攘夷的思想，終於牛乳在食養品中的位置，被士大夫們摒棄了。</p>
<p>於是牛乳很不宰的，和我們中國人絕緣了一千年。近百年來，西方科學，如潮湧至，於是牛乳也跟着西方科學而大踏步的重回中國的食養品裏來。</p>

A portion of the Japanese army attempted to break through the encirclement and stealthily cross the Fu River (撫水), but was annihilated by Chinese machine gun fire. Furthermore, according to intelligence reports, Nanjing has dispatched 20,000 troops to the Jiangxi front, but these are all Korean soldiers conscripted from the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi has launched a counterattack on Gao'an, recapturing strongholds such as Wulipu (五里鋪), Qilang Hill (七狼山), Chen Hill (陳山), and Zhen Hill (眞山), three English miles southwest of Gao'an.

The Chinese army advancing along the Yuehan (粤汉) Railway is now only ten English miles from Guangzhou. Furthermore, before recapturing Zengcheng (增城), the Chinese army repeatedly bombed it with seven Chinese aircraft. Subsequently, eight thousand Japanese soldiers counterattacked Zengcheng from Shitan (石灘) and Taiping, but were valiantly blocked by the Chinese army, preventing them from succeeding. However, casualties on both sides were heavy. According to Chinese intelligence, the Japanese army in Shanxi has abandoned its plan to attack Xi'an, and is now focusing on road construction and maintaining transportation lines, as well as conscripting manpower in the occupied areas.

<h3>Editorial: Side View on the French Concession Dispute</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai French Concession, a dispute suddenly arose between citizens and the police over the flag hanging issue. This newspaper has already commented on the matter yesterday, offering advice to both parties. Looking at the forums in this city, there is a unanimous agreement and shared opinion. In terms of the essence of the issue: compared to the various current problems, it is actually insignificant; if we must analyze the right and wrong, there is also much room for discussion; it is more about emotion and reason. Differing opinions, differing perspectives, either rigid or flexible, understandable or disputable, so those who judge it can also be vastly different. However, everyone expresses their feelings, achieving the same view through different paths, focused on the friendship between China and France, urging that big issues be reduced to small ones, and small issues be resolved without incident; what this reflects is nothing other than "the nation comes first, the people come first, military comes first, victory comes first, concentrate will, concentrate power," which has been forged by twenty-two months of gunfire, forming a common emotion, evolving into a common response, increasingly confirmed by this subtle test. Sound public opinion is the foundation of good governance; this is what the reporter humbly wishes to encourage fellow forum members to work together on in the future. By yesterday evening, the dispute had come to an end, with mutual forgiveness and peace, and there should be no more issues; assuming that there are still disputes, which cannot be abandoned, the seriousness of its nature and the importance of its relationship are still above the disputes of the previous two days, then the issue is no longer between the citizens and the police, leaving it for the supervisors to negotiate and assign responsibility.</p>
<p>There are some uneasiness to remain silent on, please allow me to express it: since the dispute has occurred, rumors and sensitive comments have been circulating in Chinese and foreign societies; some see it as initiated and directed by the Kuomintang, some see it as instigated and incited by the Communist Party; some see this as a sign of the French flattering the strong and suppressing the weak, filled with indignation; some see this as a gradual increase in the ambition of the Chinese, with some trepidation; all these statements seem to be true but are not, and must be refuted. Why do they seem to be true? The dispute arose from the hanging of flags, the hanging of flags arose from the National Spiritual Mobilization, and the Spiritual Mobilization was advocated by the Kuomintang, so the Kuomintang is suspected of initiating and directing the dispute. In the past, the Communist Party often supported class boycotts, work strikes, and market strikes, and this time some shops closed, which is close to market strikes, and some even deliberately vaguely waved the banner of communism, so the Communist Party is suspected of instigating and inciting the dispute. The reason given by the police for banning the hanging of flags, whether it stands up or not, is set aside for now, but for direct action against the flag of a country, its hasty issuance cannot be denied, but why was it done, suspected of being out of fear of the environment, so it is hated as flattering the strong and suppressing the weak. China's war of resistance has a belief in certain victory, but in the middle of the war, on the isolated island of complete preservation, it still likes to contend with the concession authorities, suspected of being the aftermath of the belief in certain victory, so it is hated as being ambitious and high-spirited. Those who falsely accuse the Kuomintang of initiating and directing, and falsely accuse the Communist Party of instigating and inciting, are plotting to destroy the two parties; those who falsely accuse the French of flattering the strong and suppressing the weak, and falsely accuse the Chinese of being ambitious and high-spirited, are plotting to alienate the two countries; they falsely accuse with a purpose.</p>
<p>How do we know it is false? Parties have party strategies, and countries have national policies, and all measures of this party and this country must be followed as the norm. Those who contradict them are either not members of this party or not citizens of this country; even if they are members of that party or citizens of that country, they cannot be seen as representing their party or country. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China are now dedicated to the war of resistance and nation-building: in terms of nation-building and production, and in terms of the "nation comes first, the people come first, military comes first, victory comes first, concentrate will, concentrate power" of the war of resistance, they definitely do not want to see disputes, let alone create disputes; they definitely do not want to talk about business closures, let alone instigate market strikes. The dispute is due to unwillingness to accept hasty direct actions, and the business closures are due to negative emotions after encountering stimulation, so what does it have to do with the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? In matters involving international relations, on the French side, they are working with the British to promote unity against aggression, taking support of the weak and defense against the tyrannical as their national policy, so how can it be said that they have the intention of flattering the strong and suppressing the weak? On the Chinese side, not only in the midst of the war of resistance have they repeatedly declared the righteousness of friendship and enmity, seeking friends for fear of not getting them: in addition to the enemy, why would there be any other conflicts between countries, or friction between people, why would they care about disputes, which would cause pain to loved ones and joy to enemies? Not only that, but China's war of resistance is subjectively for self-defense, and objectively for the common interests of friendly countries in the Far East; after the victory of the war of resistance, whether it is to restore the wounds, revitalize the people's livelihood, to develop agriculture and mining, for all construction, for international trade, it is all the more necessary for the talents and materials of friendly countries to go to the great cause together; and before, during, and after the war, what China will always share with friendly countries is the unwavering adherence to all international treaties; China's relationship of shared hardships and blessings with its friendly countries is like this, so how can it be said that it would alienate friendly countries with an ambitious and high-spirited attitude? Those who falsely accuse China of this are plotting to make the international community worry that China will not be conducive to the interests of all countries after the victory of the war of resistance, plotting to make the international community reduce its sympathy for China's war of resistance, and the dispute in the Shanghai French Concession yesterday and today is a perfect pretext for them to sow discord between China and foreign countries. Do not believe it lightly, but it is even better to cherish it!</p>
<h3>British Firmly Denies Mediation in the Sino-Japanese War; China Continues the War of Resistance and Will Never Accept Peace Talks</h3>
<p>(London) British authorities hereby declare that the claim in Japanese newspapers that Britain has offered to mediate the Sino-Japanese War is absolutely untrue. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese newspapers here are paying great attention to the European situation, especially emphasizing the impact of the European situation on China. The core of general comments is to declare that China cannot allow events in other parts of the world to affect its determination to continue the war of resistance. Holding this belief, China does not want to hear any suggestions from foreign countries, unless the suggestion meets the demands and needs of the Chinese people. Such opinions generally believe that Chairman Chiang's speech the other day also declared that China has no intention of making peace at the moment. Regarding the question of whether a conflict in Europe would benefit China, most comments believe that it would not benefit China unless the United States and the Soviet Union all participate in the war.

A unit of Japanese troops invading southeastern Shanxi was forced to withdraw for reinforcement, while Chinese troops in Taigu and Xinxian are intercepting them. (20th special dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Southern Shanxi: (1) After the Chinese army advanced on Wenxi, intense fighting ensued for a week. The army has captured dozens of Japanese rifles and two machine guns, inflicting over 2,000 casualties on the Japanese forces, and killing dozens of Japanese mules and horses. When the Chinese forces recaptured the villages of Dazecun and Xiaozecun (southeast of Wenxi), Japanese corpses littered the ground, a scene of disarray rarely seen since the start of the war. The Japanese have reinforced their positions twice from various strongholds in the north and south, but the Chinese forces are besieging them on all sides. It appears the Japanese are retreating to the transportation lines. (2) On the 19th, the fighting on the front lines of Wenxi was quiet. Most of the Japanese troops are in areas such as Guocun (southeast of Wenxi). (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Chinese army west of the Tongpu Railway is coordinating with the fighting in the triangle area, launching consistent attacks for days. One unit advanced towards Linfen from west of the Fen River, making contact with the vanguard on the 19th.

On the evening of the 17th, the Chinese forces drove out the Japanese troops from Yangzhao Village. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: There has been ongoing contact in recent days at the positions of Lijia Camp and Lijiawan, north of Lishi. The night before last, 150 Japanese soldiers launched another attack on Guojia Mountain but were repelled by the Chinese army. In Mengxian, the situation has gradually improved since the Chinese army moved into areas such as Xiyan, Xinzhuang, and Shuangfeng Mountain. The Chinese army advancing towards Xintai is destroying roads and railways along the way. Around 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers at Maling Pass were forced to flee to Taigu by the Chinese army. More than 1,000 Japanese troops suddenly appeared in Guchengzhen, hastily building fortifications. The Chinese army has dispatched troops to surround them. (20th dispatch)</p>

A unit attacked from the north of the village, launching a direct assault into the village, resulting in street fighting.

After the Chinese forces recaptured the village, they searched and attacked eastward along the Jishan-Xinjiang highway, destroying dozens of sections of roads and communication lines along the way. Japanese troops in Xinjiang repeatedly tried to come out of the city to provide cover for road repairs but were repelled by the Chinese army. (19th dispatch)</p>

<p>Yu Ji: Over the past week, the fighting in Shanxi province has been particularly intense in the Zhongyang-Lishi area. The city gates of Lishi and Zhongyang were once occupied by the Chinese army, and the Japanese bunkers were completely destroyed. The Japanese suffered heavy losses and have become more cautious, holding onto their strongholds and refraining from reckless actions. In the Shuo County, Pinglu, and Shenchi areas of northwestern Shanxi, Japanese troops have also been active in the past week. From Pinglu, 1,000 Japanese troops were transferred from Datong to join the Japanese troops in Shuo County and launch another westward attack on Qingshui River. Japanese troops in Shenchi launched attacks on Wuzhai by multiple routes, attempting to occupy Zhailan. However, they were intercepted by various Chinese forces. Only the Japanese troops in Shenchi briefly invaded Wuzhai, but they were quickly defeated by the Chinese army and fled back to Shenchi. Japanese troops in Dagu, Yuci, Qixian, Pingyao, and Jiexiu attempted to move southeast, but the Chinese army is closely monitoring them. Around 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese troops invaded Qinyuan from Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi, with heavy fighting occurring in Wanghezhen and Wangtao. The two sides are still locked in a stalemate on that line. There has been no major contact in the Linfen East and West Fushan and Anze area in the past week. Only a unit of Japanese troops in Heilongguan fled east to Tumen, where they were intercepted by the Chinese army and suffered dozens of casualties. In southern Shanxi, Yangshepo, Cuijiahe, and Guoniubao, southeast of Wenxi, have been recaptured by the Chinese army. Paoshanzhuang has also been occupied by the Chinese forces. Zhangdian, southeast of Yi, and Shiling, south of Jiexian, have been besieged by the Chinese army several times, and the Japanese troops have suffered considerable losses. A unit of the Chinese army has also advanced into Yuxiang, cutting off communications from Hengling Pass. Currently, the Japanese forces are unable to coordinate effectively, and the Chinese war situation is developing smoothly. (19th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Collective Security System to Be Extended to the East; Organizational Procedure Consists of Three Steps; British Prime Minister Hints in the House of Commons Yesterday</h3>
<p>(London) The "Yorkshire Post," the organ of former Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, known for its well-informed sources, published an article today stating that the anti-aggression line initiated by the British government may be extended to the Far East. "Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi previously met with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax on the 18th of this month and held a "preliminary discussion" on this issue." According to general knowledge, the current anti-aggression line organization procedure consists of three steps: (1) The United Kingdom and France provide guarantees to Poland, Greece, and Romania, which has already been accomplished. (2) The United Kingdom intends to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, which is about to be completed. (3) The collective security system will be extended to the Far East. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons yesterday, in response to a question from Labour Party leader Clement Attlee, that the government intends to include China and other countries in the Far East in any group resisting aggression, has attracted considerable attention from political figures here. According to information obtained by Reuters, Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi had held preliminary discussions with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Under-Secretary of State R.A. Butler on this matter before Attlee raised the question. Both Halifax and Butler expressed sympathy. It is said that if Attlee had not raised this question, other members of the House of Commons would have done so. It seems to be believed that China's joining the anti-aggression group of nations will be the third stage, as negotiations including the Soviet Union must first be completed. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi told Reuters, "Some people may think that including China in the anti-aggression group is like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, but we Chinese have a proverb that it is never too late to mend. What we need to consider is the future." The Yorkshire Post stated that the Far East and Europe cannot be regarded as watertight compartments. The existence of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo triangle reminds us that we must take this into account. Therefore, on the same day that President Roosevelt sent a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini, he made the decision to concentrate the American fleet in the Pacific. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi will attend a banquet at the invitation of the Manchester Reform Club tomorrow at noon, where he will deliver a speech. In the evening, he will speak in Derby, and on April 22, he will speak in Bolton. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Official Expresses Welcome</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The government welcomes reports from London that China may be invited to join the anti-aggression line. Informed sources believe that this shows that Britain and France are not entirely focused on Europe. "Peace is still uncertain, and war in any part of the world will affect all regions. Peace must be universal to be effective. Some people believe that China's situation is different because the war is already underway. In fact, a joint anti-aggression policy of the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States could force Japan to yield within three to six months. The anti-aggression policy should include an economic blockade against Japan, refusing to sell war necessities to Japan, refusing to buy Japanese goods, and actively assisting China. These actions would not lead to war between the great powers and Japan." At the same time, government officials said that to make the anti-aggression line effective, China must be included, as Japan is also one of the Axis powers. The concerted actions of Japan, Italy, and Germany, along with aggressive actions in different parts of the world depending on the situation, resulted in Britain and France gaining an anti-aggression partner in the Far East, helping to end the war and preventing the dispersal of forces.

<h3>U.S. President's Peace Appeal Emphasizes Both Europe and Asia; Ambassador Guo Expresses Satisfaction</h3>

Ambassador Guo further stated earnestly that China's struggle is for international political stability and democracy, and to prevent the Asian members of the Axis powers from spreading elsewhere.

<h3>Premier Kong Expresses Thoughts on Roosevelt's Peace Appeal; Japan's Aggression Against China Affects the World; Hopes the Great American Plan Can Be Realized</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) When asked for his opinion yesterday on President Roosevelt's peace appeal to Europe, Premier Kong expressed the following thoughts:</p>
<p>"President Roosevelt's note to the German leader and the note conveyed by Secretary of State Hull to the Italian Prime Minister can be described as the most important documents in modern international relations. With far-sightedness, President Roosevelt called for peace for all mankind, inviting the responsible authorities of various countries to guarantee non-aggression against other countries at a time when the situation in Europe is most critical, and prepared for discussions on disarmament and economic issues. His intention is bright and forthright, and his courage is great and profound, truly in line with the lofty ideals of the American people. All who love peace admire him. China is resisting Japan's military aggression, which has already begun the Second World War. The impact of this war is not limited to China alone, but is detrimental to all parts of the world, with the countries most closely related to China suffering the most. If a European war unfortunately breaks out while Japan's aggression continues, the flames of war will spread throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, becoming an unstoppable prairie fire, and the devastation will be unimaginable. This is what is meant by the indivisibility of peace. If all countries in the world can simultaneously provide the guarantees proposed by President Roosevelt, mankind can once again see the dawn. We deeply hope that President Roosevelt's great plan can succeed, laying the foundation for world peace." (20th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun once reported that President Roosevelt intends to send a note to the Japanese government, the content of which may be similar to the cables sent to the German and Italian authorities.

The U.S. government previously proposed convening such a conference in a note to Japan on December 31 of last year, but has not yet received a response.

<h3>Japanese Diplomacy Wandering Aimlessly; Hiranuma Meets with Konoe to Exchange Important Opinions</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) A dispatch from Tokyo reports that Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Konoe in a separate room after the regular Privy Council meeting at 11 a.m. on the 19th for an important conversation lasting approximately 30 minutes. This was a continuation of the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President of the Privy Council on March 29, during which they exchanged opinions on Japan's diplomatic measures in response to the recent European situation. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Japan's diplomatic policy is currently wandering aimlessly. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, its foreign policy has been quite uncertain. To this day, whether to unite with the fascist powers of Germany and Italy or to get closer to the democratic countries has reached the final decision-making stage, and there is no room for further hesitation. Japan has many difficult factors both domestically and abroad in establishing its diplomatic policy. The military faction advocates strengthening the anti-communist axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy, while the diplomatic circle believes that it is more advantageous for Japan to get closer to the democratic countries, otherwise it may be on a path to suicide. Recently, several Tokyo newspapers, such as the Asahi Shimbun, have discussed future diplomatic policies, arguing that Japan's foreign policy needs to be redetermined due to the development of the "China Incident." Japan may as well cooperate with Britain, France, and the United States while using the anti-communist axis as a basis. Since the Nine-Power Treaty has essentially become a dead letter, there is no need to declare its abolition. In short, Japan's diplomatic direction is currently open to appropriate choices. Forming a united front with Germany and Italy is certainly one method, but unless Germany and Italy have a firm grasp on victory in a future war, Japan cannot take this path. A change in Japan's diplomatic policy seems not impossible. (Translated by Express News Agency from Continental News)</p>
<h3>Japanese Mobilization Law; Military Is Exerting All Efforts to Force Full Implementation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The military is now exerting all efforts to promote the implementation of all provisions of the National General Mobilization Law and to expand the Prime Minister's authority to handle national mobilization matters.

<h3>Japan Occupying the Xin Nan Islands; Not for Military Strategic Purposes; Statement by Spokesman of Japanese Naval Ministry; Intended to Show Calm in Response to U.S. Fleet's Westward Transfer</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Naval Ministry told reporters today that the Japanese Navy has no intention of expanding its defense line to the Xin Nan Islands or actively using the islands for military strategic purposes. The Xin Nan Islands are mostly dangerous reefs and do not have much military value, which is why no one occupied them before Japan occupied them in 1917. The islands do not have the convenience of providing water and landing sites for seaplanes. The largest island is only 1,300 meters long and 300 meters wide. Around 1918, when the Japanese began collecting seabird guano for fertilizer and mining phosphate, they discovered some Chinese fishermen fishing there, but no Chinese people lived on the islands.

<p>Norfolk: At 6:35 this morning, the U.S. fleet, led by battleships, left Hampton Roads, intending to pass through the Panama Canal to the Pacific. Furthermore, the Commander-in-Chief of the fleet, Claude Bloch, arrived here yesterday. He held a special secret meeting with his subordinates before the fleet departed. (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Congressional circles in Washington claimed that the U.S. fleet's transfer to the Pacific was a warning to Japan's southward expansion. Today, the Naval Ministry here remained silent on this issue. A spokesman for the Japanese Naval Ministry told reporters that Japan is not concerned about the U.S. fleet's transfer to the Pacific, stating that this move is merely the fleet returning to its original base. However, he did not mention that the fleet's departure from the Atlantic was two months earlier than originally planned. The spokesman also said that Japan has no intention of using its recently occupied Xin Nan Islands as a defense base. The islands have no strategic value, which is why the great powers did not develop them in the past. (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Speech; Asks U.S. Not to Interfere in European Affairs; Says Axis Powers Are Working for Peace; Unwilling to Be in the Defendant's Seat Listening to Others' Judgments</h3>
<p>(Rome) At 11:30 this morning, Mussolini delivered a speech to workers in the Caesar Hall in the Campo de' Fiori, the capital of the ancient Roman Empire. He effectively rejected President Roosevelt's request that totalitarian countries guarantee peace, insisting that Italy and Germany are working for peace and hoping not to be interfered with. He stated, "It is meaningless to place the Axis powers in the defendant's seat. We answer this message with the statement that Italy and Germany are working for peace. We do not want to attack anyone. We want others not to interfere, so that we can work for peace." Mussolini denounced the "hysteria among certain countries behind the Alps," repeatedly stating that today's gathering is peaceful, so there is no reason to be alarmed. He continued, "Italy currently has 15,000 workers busy building the World's Fair site. If we wanted to light the fuse of an explosion, we would not concentrate our efforts on this kind of work." Campo de' Fiori is the site of the 1942 Rome World's Fair. He said the Campo de' Fiori ceremony represents the following points: "First, it is a great mobilization. People outside the country should not be alarmed by this statement. This is a mobilization for peace, with no connection to weapons. This is a mobilization of 15,000 workers. If we wanted to light the fuse of an explosion, if we were preparing a scheme of threats and aggression, we would certainly not devote ourselves to this large-scale work of organizing a World's Fair. If we had a scheme of aggression, we would not invite various countries to participate in this fair. If we still dare to persist in continuing our work under these dark clouds, this should be an indication that we do not want to attack any country. We only want to be able to continue our work. It is extremely unfair and, in a sense, unreasonable to place the Axis powers in the defendant's seat. Regarding the proposed meeting, the United States will still be the distant observer it has always been in the meeting. Experience has given us a painful lesson. The more people there are in the meeting, the more certain it is to fail. Whether or not we will respond to this famous message, I do not want to miss this opportunity to reaffirm that the Axis policy is a policy of peace and cooperation. Italy and Germany have provided much evidence of this. It is time for the spreaders of terror rumors, the prophets of doom, and the specialists in fatalism to remain silent. These kinds of people often cover up their fears, their insane resentment, and their unspeakable interest in the banner. In any case, we must not be moved by the propagation of newspapers, the idle talk of drunkards, or the messianic messages." (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech today has been welcomed by political figures here. It is said that the language used by Mussolini this time is completely different from before. Although he did not explicitly respond to President Roosevelt's telegram, he reiterated that Germany and Italy value peace and international cooperation. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Peace Aggression Front Confronts: European Diplomacy's Intrigues, the Soviet Union's Pivotal Position, Requesting British and French Aid if the Far East is Threatened, Germany and Italy Actively Woo Smaller Nations to Enhance the Berlin-Rome Axis Power</h3>
<p>(London) The Times' diplomatic correspondent states that as the world awaits Hitler's response to President Roosevelt's peace appeal, monarchs, heads of state, and diplomats are constantly traveling back and forth, making this an unprecedentedly busy time internationally. These exchanges can be divided into three categories: First, the Anglo-French alliance extending to Moscow and Ankara, with several branches developing from Poland and crossing the Balkan Peninsula, can now be seen as progressing well. Second, secret negotiations between Germany and Italy, which are easier to conduct because Hitler's birthday, a magnet for guests from Central and Southeastern Europe, is being celebrated today. Third, another Italian initiative, which does not necessarily fall entirely within the German-Italian plan. For example, the obvious contact between Rome and Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, and the discreet negotiations with the Yugoslav government in its capital, are examples of this. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, newspapers carried news of imminent new Soviet actions. According to the News Chronicle, Stalin summoned the ambassadors to Britain, France, and Germany, as well as the minister to Sweden, to return home to report on their duties. These four diplomats will arrive in Moscow today to attend a meeting to discuss the Soviet Union's attitude towards concluding a treaty with the Western powers. When the ambassadors to France and Germany passed through Poland on their way home, they reportedly met with the chargé d'affaires and listened to his views on Poland's attitude toward cooperation with the Soviet Union. A Paris dispatch in the Daily Mail states that the Soviet Union will demand that Britain and France provide support to the Soviet Union in the event of a Japanese attack, as a condition for Soviet cooperation with Britain and France to jointly resist aggression in Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, a Warsaw dispatch in The Times reports that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov recently sought to inquire whether Balkan diplomatic authorities would welcome Soviet assistance if their independence were threatened, and what form such assistance should take. Regardless of the above or other developments arising from the Soviet Union's significant new activities in European affairs, commentators in the morning papers believe that Anglo-French contacts with various countries are now making good progress.

<h3>Anglo-Turkish Anti-Aggression Negotiations Successful: Compromise Reached in Principle</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that negotiations between British and Turkish authorities regarding Turkey's accession to a collective security organization are progressing very smoothly and that an agreement has been reached in principle. It is agreed that if a war breaks out in Europe and spreads to the Balkan Peninsula, Turkey should assist the allied countries of the Balkan Peninsula, namely Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia, and also assist the Western European countries, namely Britain and France. Conversely, if Turkey is attacked, Britain should immediately provide assistance. In addition, several British and French army and navy experts will travel to Turkey together in the near future to discuss cooperation methods with the Turkish army. Britain and France will also provide Turkey with necessary military supplies in wartime. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>German-Romanian Talks Conclude: Germany Declares No Territorial Ambitions Towards Romania, Understanding Reached on Promoting Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu was accompanied by the German Foreign Minister to meet with German leader Hitler yesterday, his Berlin talks have concluded. Although no official announcement has been made, people in the German capital seem very satisfied with the general outcome of the talks. It is widely believed that both sides have reached broad agreement and that decisions have been made on commercial cooperation and political relations. According to a statement made by Gafencu to reporters, he has obtained a broad understanding during his visit to Berlin and stated that Romania is willing to cooperate with Germany to the greatest possible extent.

On the morning of the 26th, he will visit an air force airfield and the outskirts of London, and then travel to Paris in the afternoon of the same day. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Germany to Return to Post Soon; U.S. Attitude Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Washington) Political figures here attach great importance to the report announced by British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the House of Commons yesterday that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson will soon return to his post in Berlin. Authoritative sources state that the United States' attitude towards the ambassador's return remains unchanged. In other words, Ambassador Wilson, who was recalled from Germany last month, is still working at the State Department for the time being, and the US embassy in Germany is being handled by a chargé d'affaires. A decision will be made after Hitler's speech on the 28th of this month. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Government Adopts "Carrot and Stick Policy" Towards Totalitarian States; Foreign Secretary Explains Current British Foreign Policy, Aiming for Peace and No Intention of Encircling Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Britain continues its efforts to organize a pan-European anti-aggression group, while still leaving avenues open for compromise with totalitarian states. Chamberlain seems to be adopting what the Germans call a "carrot and stick policy." Foreign Secretary Halifax stated in the House of Commons that Britain is willing to engage in economic negotiations with Germany, an act of Britain's expression of peace to Mr. Hitler. However, at the same time, the Prime Minister intends to reorganize the cabinet, which may be said to be the Prime Minister's intention to adopt a tough attitude towards totalitarian states. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax spoke in the House of Lords today, explaining various aspects of British policy. He strongly denied the claim that current British political actions have aggressive intentions, saying, "To say that the discussions currently being conducted by the British government and the guarantees it has given against aggression contain any aggressive intentions is simply raving. The cry of 'encirclement' clearly has an effect. I believe it is meant to imply that the British government's aim is to impede the legitimate aspirations of other peoples or to engage in war to prevent their legitimate aspirations from being realized. I am prepared to give the most solemn assurance on behalf of the government that British policy has never had such an intention, because such an intention is not only foolish but also contrary to the entire trend of British thought. The British intention is actually based on the desire for people to live in the world each according to their own wishes. If war does occur in the world, as far as the British people are concerned, the war will be waged only because there is no other way to defend what they consider more important than life itself." The Foreign Secretary spoke of the withdrawal of the world's three major powers from the League of Nations, saying, "Disappointed countries have ultimately rejected the principles aimed at ensuring international security. The danger is even greater when national interests often conflict and ideological clashes occur. We do not always give the same meaning to the same terms. The concept of justice, respect for treaties, and the value of promises are interpreted differently according to national desires, and therefore their demands do not violate rights."</p>
<p>After expressing sympathy and goodwill towards the Spanish government, which is undertaking arduous reconstruction work, the Foreign Secretary said that the main objectives of British foreign policy are the maintenance of genuine world peace and the protection of the assets and legitimate interests of British people overseas. The British government's current efforts to resist any further aggression are not contrary to the policy principles it has stated. On the contrary, the British government hopes that this policy can further confirm its principles and turn aggression into friendly discussions and negotiations. The British government is eager to work with all peace-loving countries and is determined to maintain the independence of neutral countries.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary spoke of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Moscow, saying that he believed that all that could be said at this time was that the two countries were actively engaged in negotiations. He had every hope that the mutual recognition of different viewpoints would enable the negotiations to proceed as desired.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also spoke of President Roosevelt's telegram appealing for peace, saying that the American president had expressed his view of international relations in extremely clear terms and with all his great authority. The British government has clearly expressed its sympathy in this regard. He is convinced that billions of people in all countries expect the American president's initiative to have a successful effect. As for the economic considerations in the current situation suggested by the American president, the British government is prepared to make a contribution in this matter. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Strengthens Defenses in Two Oceans: Adding Naval and Air Bases, Requiring US$66,800,000, Vincent Bill Passed by Senate and Sent to House</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today approved a defense bill to build naval aviation bases with US$66,800,000. The bill has now been returned to the House for amendments. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Vincent Naval Base Bill was unanimously passed in the Senate yesterday. The bill stipulates the establishment of sixteen naval and air force bases, nine of which are in the Pacific, with a cost of $66.8 million. However, the $15 million for the defense of Guam is not included. According to this bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives with 368 votes to 4 six weeks ago, most of the items were built by the Naval Affairs Committee. It is heard that the development of Guam's harbor will be handled together with the river and harbor projects. In addition, the construction costs of the Pacific bases are as follows according to the provisions of this bill:</p>
<p>Wake Island US$2,000,000</p>
<p>Midway Island</p>
<p>US$5,351,000</p>
<p>Johnston Island US$2,884,000</p>
<p>Palmyra Island US$1,20,000</p>
<p>Kodiak Island US$8,741,000</p>
<p>Shelikof Island (Alaska) US$2,884,000</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor US$2,812,000</p>
<p>Unalaska Island US$1,500,000</p>
<p>Kenneya Island US$5,800,000</p>
<p>In addition to the Pacific, the Atlantic side focuses on the Caribbean Sea in the South Atlantic, especially the Panama Canal. The naval and air bases in St. Jean will be expanded with a budget of US$9,138,000. In addition, the fortifications of the nine naval bases in the Pacific are all considered "urgent" constructions in the Navy report. However, once constructed, the line of defense has exceeded 3,000 miles beyond Hawaii. But in general, it is still the triangular line of Alaska, Hawaii and Panama. In addition to this bill, Vincent also proposed a US$30 million naval base public building fee案 for other construction of various bases. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Establishes Ministry of Supply with Burgin as Minister</h3>

The research, design, and testing departments in the Army Department will be transferred to the Ministry of Supply. The manufacture and inspection of the Royal Arsenal will be undertaken by the new Minister of Transport. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>All of Germany Celebrates the Leader's Birthday: Grand Parade Held in Berlin, 50,000 Army Personnel Paraded, 200 Aircraft Soared Through the Sky</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The most important event in Germany's celebration of Hitler's 50th birthday was the military parade held at 11 a.m. this morning. The scale of the parade was unprecedented in Germany. Countless troops were lined up from the former palace square through Linden Street to the newly built East-West Highway. Hitler, accompanied by Air Force Commander-in-Chief Goering, Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder, and Army Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch, first inspected the flag team, then drove past the lined-up troops. At 11:20 a.m., they arrived at the judging stand set up at the entrance of the technical school, where many foreign guests were invited to attend. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German army, navy, and air force units paraded at 11:00 a.m. this morning to celebrate the birthday of leader Hitler, led by officers, students, and cadets, followed by paratroopers, air transport teams, two regiments of infantry, and one squadron each of cavalry and artillery. Next were various motorized units, including a unit of infantry transported by trucks, three units of tank vehicles transported by trucks, and then flat-fire artillery teams, anti-aircraft artillery teams, motorized cavalry teams, and motorized artillery teams. The entire procession took 45 minutes to pass in front of the leader. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is leader Hitler's 50th birthday. Celebrations here began at 9:00 a.m. First, the leader's guards paraded in front of the Prime Minister's office. Until 9:25 a.m., Archbishop Orsenigo, the Papal Ambassador and leader of the diplomatic corps, extended birthday greetings to leader Hitler on behalf of the diplomatic corps. After that, ambassadors, ministers, and dignitaries from various countries, such as Privy Council President and Protector of Bohemia and Moravia Neurath, Bohemian and Moravian President Hácha, Slovak Prime Minister Tiso, and Berlin Mayor Lippert, all congratulated the leader. The Nazi leader of the Free City of Danzig, Forster, also presented the leader with a certificate of honorary citizen of the Free City. Until 11:00 a.m., leader Hitler, accompanied by Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General von Brauchitsch, and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, held a large-scale army parade with as many as 50,000 troops participating, and 200 aircraft soared through the sky, making it a grand occasion. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Eight million five hundred thousand Germans are celebrating leader Hitler's 50th birthday today. All industries are closed for a day, so that all people can participate in the National Socialist Party's rallies on streets decorated with national flags. Mr. Hitler met with all his subordinates in the leader's house this morning, from secretariat staff to tailors and barbers. This kind of reception is completely the same as the leader's previous preferential treatment of the general public, because in the past year, Hitler has traveled all over the country, and his opportunities to approach the public are also more than in the past. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>The Leader's Close Associates Offer Praises and Eulogies</h3>
<p>(Berlin) As Germany celebrates the 50th birthday of its leader Hitler, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels delivered a special broadcast speech last night, broadcast throughout the country, revealing the great significance of celebrating the leader's birthday. He said, "All countries that have moved from friendship to alliance with Germany will naturally feel honored with the German people on this occasion of the leader's birthday. Even countries that are usually distant from Germany will have a deep impression. Today, the name of Hitler has become a program of world politics, and it has amazed the world like a legend and myth. World culture has been divided into two major camps because of this. Anyone who examines today's world must study the word Hitler in order to understand what the world is. In the past ten years, Hitler has set off a huge wave of spiritual revolution, transforming Germany into a new look. Germany in 1918 is very different from today. The spiritual revolution unprecedented in history has created today's Great Germany, the most commendable of which is that it was completed without shedding a drop of blood. What is especially important is that the man-made situation in Europe, although peaceful on the surface, is actually fraught with crises, and there is a danger of a prairie fire at any time. Now Hitler has laid the foundation for its peace with a spiritual revolution. This peace is built on a realistic foundation, not on abstract rational morality. Hitler's policies have always been far-sighted, and both ideals and reality are emphasized. Ideals are the mother of facts, and reality is the fruit of facts. This is Hitler's political genius, who is very capable of holding a simple and unwavering purpose, and using unpredictable methods to create today's Great Germany. Although Western democratic countries inevitably envy the National Socialist Germany, they have always wanted to imprison Germany with the Treaty of Versailles, but with Hitler's 20 years of struggle, they have already broken free from this shackle and rebuilt Germany on a solid military strength. Economic life and cultural life are now thriving. The once-fallen country has now regained its light." (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Tomorrow is leader Hitler's 50th birthday. Minister of Aviation Goering gave a eulogy this afternoon, saying, "The leader is the greatest figure since ancient times. Politicians and statesmen all over the world often engage in conspiracies and tactics. Foreign journalists often slander our country. We should all ignore them. What we should listen to is only the leader's instructions." In addition, leader party representative and Minister without Portfolio Hess, on behalf of the National Socialist Party, presented 50 letters handwritten by former Prussian King Frederick I to the leader as a birthday gift. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>General Goering also published a special article in the National Socialist Party's organ newspaper "People's Observer" to praise him, saying, "Germany's ability to move from the valley to the tree and re-establish itself in an outstanding position is due to leader Hitler's hard work over the years. Today, Germany's military strength is fearless in terms of land, sea, and air, protecting the safety of Germany's vast territory. In today's world, no one can surpass Germany's leader Hitler in this amazing and great cause. Hitler is the greatest politician in German history. On the occasion of the leader's 50th birthday, we really have no appropriate words to express the gratitude and admiration in our hearts." (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Envoys Promoted and Decorated</h3>
<p>(Berlin) On the occasion of German leader Hitler's 50th birthday today, the German government issued an order appointing former Shanghai Consul General Lieutenant Colonel Kriebel as Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promoting Shanghai Deputy Consul Luedtke to Consul, and promoting Consul Schäfer in Chongqing to First-Class Consul. In addition, Duernburg, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Klinger, former Consul General in San Francisco, were all given the title of Minister Plenipotentiary.

<h3>The Soviet Union's Military Equipment is Substantial, Fully Defending the Country; Army Chief Inspects Western Border Defenses and Returns to Beijing; Major Cities Hold Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>(London) According to news from Moscow, the Soviet Army recently conducted exercises in the area near the Baltic coast along the borders of various countries. National Defense People's Commissar Marshal Voroshilov also went to the western border to inspect the defenses, which lasted for three weeks, and only recently returned to Moscow. In addition, Deputy National Defense People's Commissar Mekhlis once said, "The Soviet Union's strength is sufficient to cope with all contingencies. Once a crisis occurs, there is no need to mobilize temporarily, nor is there a need to seek allied countries." Foreign observers are therefore increasingly convinced that the country is indeed prepared. Generally, Moscow believes that Germany may take advantage of the birthday opportunity of the country's leader Hitler to take action against the Free City of Danzig, which is still uncertain, and the Soviet Union also suspects whether Poland is willing to share weal and woe with Romania when Germany engages in aggression. Moreover, news from Warsaw repeatedly stated that Poland is willing to negotiate directly with Germany on the issue of Danzig Freedom City, which has caused a bad impression on the Soviet Union. In the Soviet press, they all spoke of a collective security system and a collective anti-aggression movement. When commenting on the telegram sent by US President Roosevelt, they all said that German and Italian dictators may submit a deceitful reply of peace "in order to deceive the Western governments and make them give up the proposed peace guarantee measures." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Large-scale public air defense and anti-gas exercises are being conducted in 60 cities throughout the Soviet Union, including Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Khabarovsk, Baku, Minsk, etc. After the alarm is issued, all working people in the city wear gas masks and continue to work. The exercise is scheduled to be held until May 1. (TASS, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Fleet Sails to Western Waters, Detouring Through the British North Sea; Submarine Squadron Crosses the English Channel</h3>

<h3>The Transforming Power of Love</h3>
<p>Many men and women, after getting married, completely change their thoughts, actions, personalities, and habits. Therefore, we know that love truly has a marvelous transforming effect. This is a fact. A proud young woman, when at her parents' home, would not even deign to bow her head to her parents; everything was her world. However, once she marries a loving husband, not only does it cause a significant change in her physiology, but her personality also becomes infinitely considerate and gentle as she serves her beloved husband. Sometimes, when they have a child who is the crystallization of their love, even if she was very fastidious and clean before marriage, she doesn't feel that her child's feces and urine are dirty at all. She sometimes even has a feeling of admiration, thinking that her beloved husband is truly an all-powerful transforming doctor.</p>
<p>Men are the same. Many who are wasteful before marriage become very frugal after marriage. Some even regard their beloved wife as their soul, with all their words and deeds governed by this soul, completely different from before. Some who were physically weak become healthy after marriage. Indeed, an adult's life is truly inseparable from love. As a Western saying goes, "A fulfilling life must be led by wisdom and encouraged by love." If a person loses love, how dull and miserable will their life feel? Therefore, whether male or female, as long as it is for love, they are willing to be transformed by him or her. Indeed, once an energetic man marries a beautiful and graceful woman, because of the intensity of their love, some differences will occur in their thoughts, actions, personalities, and habits, but these differences will inevitably be subtly influenced and gradually become consistent. Therefore, in the harmony of love, they not only transform themselves but also create their future life. How beautiful and happy this is!</p>
<p>However, transformation must be based on a healthy body. If a man has committed masturbation or nocturnal emission in his early years, or because of post-marital debauchery and overindulgence, as well as worries and injuries, he suffers from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms, then the sexual life that forms the foundation of the couple will inevitably be imperfect. Love will be destroyed because of this. Without love, there is naturally no talk of transformation and creation. I am afraid that their entire world will be destroyed with it. Aren't there truly many who divorce or commit suicide because of a lack of love?</p>
<p>A clever husband who wants to seek a remedy must fundamentally treat his illness. According to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" [likely translated as Reproductive Essence] is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. Because this preparation can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night after taking it. Continuous use will surely fundamentally cure the above symptoms in a short period. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Ximituo Shi Gu Jing Pian" [likely translated as Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets] to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, then the effect will be even faster. If you can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by a specialist doctor and then use various scientific therapies, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Health and Beauty</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Breasts and Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>In today's national spiritual mobilization, we can no longer leave health to be able to reproduce and survive. Health is not only a problem that every man cannot ignore, but also something that every woman should strive to achieve. Women in Europe and America have an unusually rich understanding of health and beauty. They recognize that the development of the breasts is to create a healthy soul, and plump hips are to form a beautiful body. They are constantly using various scientific methods to achieve health and beauty standards.</p>
<p>There is an iron-like fact before our eyes. Just look at women with withered breasts, who are bound to lose health and happiness, and suffer from many illnesses and pains. Not only will they inevitably fail in future competitions for health and beauty, but once they enter into sexual life, they will inevitably promote conditions such as anesthesia and infertility. Even if they conceive, the children born will not only be difficult to raise, but also because of the mother's scant or overly weak milk, their mortality will be particularly high. As a result, they cannot fit into society and serve and perform their duties like men, nor can they win the favor of their husbands, giving birth to whimsically, or even being abandoned by their husbands. There is no happiness at all!</p>
<p>But why do women's breasts wither? According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologist Randeaning and others, it is believed that it is caused by masturbation, chest binding, leucorrhea, irregular menstruation, and postpartum weakness, which destroys the function of the ovaries. The only remedy is to actively take the ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su" [likely translated as Reproductive Essence], which is the most effective treatment. This preparation is well-formulated, and after taking it for one day and night, it can nourish the function of the ovaries, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can not only make withered breasts become high, but also make thin hips become plump, strengthen the body and beautify the face. The benefits are too numerous to mention.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of Youth with Nocturnal Emission and Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>The problem of youth masturbation is really too serious, because this is the starting point of going down a dead end. Once a young person masturbates in the early stages of spring, it is extremely easy to become addicted. If the bad habit is slightly deeper, the sperm gate will inevitably be destroyed and become loose, and the sexual nerves will also be easily weakened due to excessive stimulation. At this stage, spermatorrhea is bound to follow. Semen is of great importance to our health and longevity. Now, with spermatorrhea, the semen in the body is equivalent to having a leaky vessel, then the body's health will inevitably decline rapidly. Therefore, gradually the face becomes sallow and thin, appetite is poor, brainpower is weak, memory is poor, back aches, limbs are tired, spirit is depressed, and ambition is depressed. If this kind of youth is studying at school, they will be mentally disturbed, failure is imminent, and their studies will inevitably be lower than their peers, or even fail and be expelled. If they want to learn a trade, how can they endure hardship, be diligent in their duties? Not only will their skills not be outstanding, but there will be a place to lose their job! If they are in love, because of their unsightly appearance, they will inevitably be rejected by the opposite sex, fall into the pain of unrequited love. Even worse, if spermatorrhea is too frequent, the development function is prevented, resulting in short stature, and the sex organ is as short and small as a finger, kidney deficiency and impotence, thin sperm and infertility and other symptoms will follow one after another. In this way, in married life, they will inevitably be hated by their wives, tragedies will be staged in the family, or there will be no children, leaving a lifelong regret!</p>
<p>The only treatment for spermatorrhea at this time is to continuously take "Ximituo Shi Gu Jing Pian" [likely translated as Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets] to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, then the spermatorrhea can be cured. Those who have caused the above symptoms due to spermatorrhea must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" [likely translated as Reproductive Essence] to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase semen and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use will surely achieve the effect of curing diseases and prolonging life. If the patient can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by a specialist doctor and then use electrotherapy, injection, surgery and other symptomatic treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>White Turbidity Forum</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Dai De, Gonorrhea Specialist</p>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Free consultation, only 4 corners for the registration fee</p>
<h3>Acute Gonorrhea That Is Easily Cured</h3>
<p>Acute white turbidity is unbearable for patients because of the pain, and they are encountering it for the first time, so they don't know what to do. In fact, this kind of acute gonorrhea is not as dangerous as the patient feels when they are in pain. Not only is it not a dangerous symptom, but it is also a symptom that is easy to treat. The patient's consciousness should be calm, and they should quickly ask a doctor with experience, complete equipment, and willingness to take responsibility for treatment, so that they can be fundamentally cured in seven or eight days. The most difficult problem with acute white turbidity is whether the doctor can be responsible for thoroughly treating the patient, and whether the patient can recuperate and abandon bad medicines. If you are cautious in choosing a doctor and recuperating, it is the easiest way for the patient to get rid of the pain of gonorrhea. Patients must pay attention! .</p>
<p>Patients develop symptoms three or four days after unclean sexual intercourse. The body develops a temperature of 37 or 38 degrees, the head is swollen, the foreskin is swollen, there is pus and blood, and urination is unusually difficult. For the treatment of acute white turbidity, I first use a specially made vaccine and the most advanced chemical therapy. At the same time, I also use German Luzhuping electrotherapy and cooling methods to produce an antitoxic effect in the body, quickly extinguish the gonorrhea bacteria like a raging fire, and stop the inflammation. Therefore, the pain can be stopped on the same day, the turbidity can be cleared and inflammation can be eliminated in three days, and a complete cure can be achieved in one week. It has been proven time and time again. Experts in Europe and the West have recently become quite interested in this therapy, and more and more people are adopting it. All famous venereal disease hospitals have unanimously adopted it. The reason is that it has excellent results, and the cure rate for acute gonorrhea accounts for more than 90%.</p>

<h3>The Suspected Kidnapping Case of Mr. Taiaote: Japanese Authorities Ordered All Parties Involved to Keep Secrets; Seemed Remorseful After His Release; Chen Xigeng Assassinated and Killed; Tianjin Falls into Unease Again</h3>
<p>The Tianjin correspondent of the Zi Lin Xi Bao (North China Daily News) on April 12 reported: Mr. Taiaote, who was kidnapped, was released on April 3 after being held for 17 days. The exact details of Taiaote's kidnapping, especially his release, are shrouded in mystery. It is said that at the request of the Japanese military authorities, all parties involved in this matter must keep it secret, so they have remained silent to this day. It is not allowed to disclose any information about this strange incident. The only thing that seems certain is that no ransom was paid. The Japanese seemed remorseful after the incident and assured the foreign consuls that foreign residents could now return to their residences in the special zone with peace of mind, as they would guarantee the complete safety of foreigners. All of this is very incomprehensible and has naturally aroused discussion and ridicule among the general public. This case cannot be considered resolved, and the troubling problem of controlling terrorism in the foreign concessions seems to have arisen again. The shooting in the cinema in this port has plunged Tianjin into unease again. At 5:30 pm on April 9, Chen Xigeng, the customs superintendent, was shot and killed in the Da Guangming Cinema. When the murderer fled, two foreigners were killed, one being killed and one seriously injured. The assassination appeared to have been carefully planned, and the choice of time, place, and method of tracking the victim had been premeditated for a long time. Before the incident, a Chinese man wearing Western clothes and speaking with a northern accent went to the ticket office of the Da Guangming Cinema and asked the theater to add a few words to the screen, notifying Mr. Chen to come out to the rest area, saying that a friend was waiting for him to talk to him. At that time, Mr. Chen was sitting in the balcony with his wife and children watching the film "Gong Geting" [likely "Going Gay"]. Upon seeing the message, he got up to leave, but his wife said it would not be too late to leave after the film was over. The man waiting outside tried to lure Mr. Chen to the rest area using this method, so that he could escape more easily. Seeing that this plan did not work, he bought a balcony ticket and went inside, choosing to sit behind Mr. Chen. When the film was about to end, a scene showing British troops fighting rioters was being screened, and gunshots were continuous. The man sitting behind Mr. Chen, whether he deliberately chose this opportunity or happened to encounter it, was an opportunity suitable for the act. He immediately took out a large .38 caliber Mauser pistol from his pocket and fired four shots directly at Mr. Chen in front of him. One bullet hit Mr. Chen's wrist, one bullet went through both cheeks, and hit a certain Chinese youth in the front row. The third bullet hit the head. Mr. Chen got up and staggered a few steps before falling to the ground and dying. At first, due to the darkness in the theater and the noise of the film, the audience did not know that a tragedy had occurred, but the young Russian sportsman Mansurov, who was sitting at the end of that row, had seen it. When the murderer fled past him, Mansurov tried to grab him, but was shot in the abdomen. When the murderer rushed downstairs, he encountered Klose, a Swiss engineer from the tram company. It is not known whether he also tried to stop the murderer, or whether the murderer fired a shot to facilitate his escape. Klose was shot and died on the spot. An empty pistol abandoned by the murderer was found next to his body. Before the shouts broke out in the theater, the murderer had already fled into the bustling city. Mansurov was rushed to a nearby hospital and underwent emergency surgery. He is expected to recover. Klose left behind a wife and a child. He was about to retire and return to his country, but unexpectedly died in the disaster. The assassination of Mr. Chen was clearly political in nature. Last year, Mr. Chen served as the "President of the Tianjin Branch of the United Reserve Bank." On March 24, he was appointed by the "Provisional Government" as the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, but in fact he did not take this position. He neither entered the Customs nor met with Customs personnel. A week ago, Chen went to Beiping for a trip. According to him, he intends to ask the "Provisional Government" to cancel the appointment, because Chen has received many warnings and dare not accept this position and take the terrible risk.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Rugao Forcibly Conscript Recruits</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Fiercely Attack Xinsheng Port</p>
<p>One Japanese Soldier Killed in Heavy Fighting</p>
<p>A Rugao dispatch reports that Rugao has been occupied for more than a year since its fall on March 18 last year. The area occupied by the Japanese troops is only in the urban area and the area along the Tongru-Ruxin highway. The suburbs are still under the control of Chinese troops. Recently, because the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties on the front line, they first investigated the household registration in their occupied areas, and then forcibly conscripted recruits, one person per bao (unit of 10 households). If a recruit escapes and does not return, their property will be destroyed or confiscated. For example, Zhang Chengren, the former President of the Beiping Court and former magistrate of Dongtai County, who lived in Shanghai to avoid the violence of the Japanese troops, had not returned home for a long time. His residence in Shizhuang Town was demolished by the Japanese troops, resulting in immeasurable losses. There are countless similar cases. It is reported that the first batch of conscripted recruits have been concentrated for training and will soon be transferred to other places. However, the families of the conscripted recruits are all anxious and crying in pain. It is said to be tragic. Xinsheng Port is located in the southwestern countryside of Rugao and can be reached directly by the Ruxin Highway. It is an important transportation hub for the county. After the Japanese troops occupied Rugao, they occupied the port, stationed heavy troops, and strictly inspected travelers. In this year, Chinese troops attacked the port more than ninety times, causing great panic among the Japanese troops. Therefore, two months ago, they forced the waterfront workers to build strong barracks, which were only recently completed. At about 2 pm on the 12th of this month, about 70 or 80 Chinese troops came to the port disguised as villagers to destroy the buildings. When the Chinese troops arrived at the port, they were discovered by the Japanese troops, and they fired at each other. The sound of light and heavy machine guns and grenades was endless. Residents fled to the surrounding countryside, especially the members of the puppet organizations, who fled in panic and were in a state of utter chaos. The Chinese troops surrounded the barracks and bombed them for three hours. During the heavy fighting, one Japanese soldier was killed and several were injured. Later, because the Japanese troops from Shizhuang Town, three miles away from the port, came to the rescue, the Chinese troops withdrew due to the disparity in numbers.</p>
<h3>The North Jiangsu Army Has Completed the Counter-Offensive Deployment; The Entire War Zone Has Adopted a Counter-Offensive Posture; Huaiyin and Huaian Have Been Surrounded by Chinese Troops; The Chinese Troops in Siyang Seized Many Spoils of War</h3>
<p>A Taixian dispatch reports that the various units of the Chinese army in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu have completed their deployment and are now launching the prelude to guerrilla warfare. The heroic soldiers of the Chinese army feel very excited as they are active in the plains and mountains during this bright spring season. At the moment, the entire war zone has adopted a counter-offensive posture. In northern Jiangsu, Huaiyin and Huaian have been surrounded separately. They have been fiercely attacking the southwest gates for days. The Japanese troops in the city are holding on to the walls, and the fierce fighting has lasted for two days and nights. The county towns of Lianshui, Funing, Siyang, and Suqian are all under the surveillance and siege of the Chinese army. The Japanese troops cannot take care of each other, and their occupied cities and strongholds are showing signs of wavering.</p>
<p>Funing Residents Annihilate Japanese Troops</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed in Funing forced the people to use counterfeit money and stipulated that one yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for six jiao of counterfeit money. The people hated them to the bone. For days, they have repeatedly attacked the Japanese troops in the suburbs. More than 70 Japanese troops stationed in Xiaowuzi Town in the county were again raided by the Republic of China on the 5th. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and were almost completely annihilated. After hearing the news, the Japanese headquarters urgently sent troops to rescue them, but the militia unit had safely returned to their defense. In addition, there are currently a total of 600 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops in Funing City. On the 4th, more than 100 infantrymen were sent to Yangzhai, allegedly to capture anti-Japanese elements and slaughtered 30 to 40 civilians. The local people, who have been repeatedly slaughtered by the Japanese troops for days, have automatically formed armed groups for self-defense and are preparing to give the Japanese troops a serious blow.</p>
<p>The People of Lianshui Rise Up to Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>Recently, the people of Lianshui have repeatedly intercepted the Japanese troops. The situation is as follows: (1) On the 2nd, more than 100 Japanese infantrymen, with two artillery pieces, retreated from Lianshui to Funing. About 1,000 militia from the sixth and seventh districts of Lianshui pursued the Japanese troops in separate directions. They encountered the militia when passing through Dachengguo Village, and the fierce fighting lasted for about two hours. (2) One tank and 50 or 60 infantrymen retreated from Lianshui to Xin'an Town on the 4th. They came into contact with the militia when passing through Shijia Wharf, and the fighting lasted for about four or five hours before they fled. (3) There are a small number of Japanese in Chenjiagang, Xiangshui ★, Xin'an Town, Zhangjiadian, Dayi Mountain, Xinpu, Banpu, and Yangjiaji in Lianshui. (4) There are about six or seven small Japanese ships parked in Xichao Lake in Xiangshui, which travel back and forth between Xiangshui and Chenjiagang from time to time. (5) There are still 400 to 500 Japanese troops in Xiangshui. Han Jianru, a traitor, is the chairman of the town's maintenance association. Han was originally employed by Gangqing Shipping Company in Chenjiagang.</p>
<p>Siyang County Magistrate Wins Bloody Battle</p>
<p>Wang Dianhua, the magistrate of Siyang County, led the county's regular troops to fight fiercely with the Japanese troops in Zhuangtan, Shijiazhuang, and Lujiazui on March 22, and sank three Japanese sailing ships and destroyed several others at Yunjia Ferry that evening, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers, including the squad leader Suzuki. They captured a gas cannon, two boxes of ammunition, one light machine gun, 1,000 rounds of ammunition, more than a dozen sets of khaki military uniforms, eight gas masks, several boxes of medicines, and operational plans and diaries. Bian Youcai, the leader of the Chinese detachment, had his left ear pierced by an explosion, the soldier Pan Decai was killed by an explosion, and Wang Youhai was wounded by an explosion. A total of more than 20 Japanese corpses were recovered. In addition, the Siyang County Government Office is currently temporarily set up. Magistrate Wang is currently organizing a traitor eradication team and has killed more than a dozen traitors. After receiving the report, Chairman Han not only credited Magistrate Wang with one merit but also awarded bonuses to reward the troops. He also ordered Magistrate Wang to submit a report on the meritorious officers and soldiers separately for commendation.</p>
<h3>The Result of the Wu County Puppet Government's Collection of Land Tax</h3>
<p>Most Landowners Refuse to Pay</p>
<p>The Puppet Government Is in Dire Straits and Cannot Maintain Itself</p>
<p>A Suzhou dispatch reports that the puppet county government is in dire financial straits due to the weak collection of land tax and will be unable to maintain itself. The county has more than 1.8 million mu of land in Changyuan, Yuanhe, and the Taihu Lake area. If all the provincial and county taxes are collected, it would amount to about 1.8 million. Among them, more than 1 million mu of land is managed by various businesses, which pay the grain tax. For more than 700,000 mu of self-owned land, the grain tax is paid directly by the farmers. The first installment of grain tax to be collected for self-owned land in the 27th year totaled 633,802 households. As of the end of March, only more than 10,000 households had paid, and more than 620,000 were estimated to be unpaid. The situation is the same for the second installment. Only more than 8,000 households have paid so far. Therefore, the puppet taxation office has only collected about 10,000 yuan. The financial exhaustion of the puppet county government can be seen from this.</p>
<h3>The Downfall of Traitors in Wukang County</h3>
<p>Yao Laoqiao, Chairman of the Maintenance Association</p>
<p>Was Dismembered by Japanese Troops After Being Suspended in the Air</p>
<p>A Ningbo dispatch reports that Yao Laoqiao, the chairman of the puppet maintenance association in Wukang County, was taken to Hangzhou by Japanese troops and sentenced to death for leaking military secrets. Yao's hands and feet were nailed to a board and suspended in the air until he was torn apart. The manner of death was extremely tragic. The downfall of a traitor who acted as an accomplice for the tigers can be a warning.</p>
<h3>The New Fourth Army's Training Camp Transformed into an Anti-Japanese Academy; Enrollment to Begin in Mid-May</h3>
<p>(Tunxi dispatch) In order to implement the training of guerrilla cadres, the New Fourth Army previously established a large-scale training camp in the Southern Anhui Headquarters, specializing in recruiting unemployed youths from guerrilla areas and teaching them special military and political knowledge. More than 1,000 youths from various places who heard the news went to enroll and receive training for a term of three months. After graduation, they were assigned to various guerrilla areas to organize and train the people. The educational methods adopted the following four types: (1) Military education, such as battlefield orders, guerrilla tactics, field service, shooting regulations, and military geography; (2) Classroom education, such as the anti-Japanese situation, training the people, international issues, and the history of the Chinese revolution; (3) Incidental education, which is to implement education whenever there is an opportunity, such as various commemorative days, temporary problems among students, or meaningful domestic and foreign news are used as teaching materials, and opportunities are used to implement extracurricular education; (4) Self-education, which is the education of students by students, such as discussion meetings, life review meetings, and seminars. It is now reported that the first class of trained youths is about to graduate, and the second class will be expanded and transformed into an Anti-Japanese Academy. Its internal organization will follow the methods of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" and "Shaanxi Public School" in the Northwest. It is expected that enrollment can begin in mid-May.</p>
<h3>The Third National Education Conference Resolutions (12) Proposal for Improving Physical Education (Part 1)</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Yi Sheng's Airmail from Chongqing)</p>
<p>The following is the physical education improvement proposal passed by the National Education Conference:</p>
<p>Regarding how physical education should be implemented in the future to align with the overall educational policy and realize its due function, careful planning and formulation of a plan are necessary, to be implemented in stages to achieve the ultimate goal. Here, seventeen principles are proposed as guidelines for formulating plans and measures: (1) The purpose of physical education is to cultivate the ability to defend the nation. The scope of physical education ranges from personal health to the survival of the nation, the race, and even humanity. The content of physical education includes all large muscle physical activities and hygienic living. The method of physical education is to use physical activity as a tool to achieve educational effects. These principles should be fully elucidated in an effective manner to dispel past misunderstandings and establish future beliefs. (2) Physical education administration should establish a sound and effective organizational system, strengthen the physical education administrative agencies of the Ministry of Education, and determine their legal status so they can be responsible for the design and implementation of national physical education and health education. Education departments (social bureaus) of each province (city) should add physical education sections to promote central physical education and health education laws and guide the facilities for local physical education and health education. Education bureaus (sections) of each county (city) should add physical education administrative personnel to implement local physical education and health education so that all physical education and health laws can be promoted at each level and physical education and health undertakings can be universally developed. (3) Physical education and health education funding should be formally included in the regular budget of the central and local governments as a part of the cultural undertaking expenditure, to facilitate the enrichment of equipment, the cultivation of personnel, and the organization of undertakings. The amount should be based on the needs of the implementation plan and establish standards. (4) Local and school physical education venues, supplies, and health facilities should be planned and managed in a unified manner by the competent authorities at all levels, taking into account the needs of all parties, establishing standards, and expanding in stages. Parks and public lands should be utilized as much as possible to create a good environment. Rewards should be given for self-made equipment and supplies to maintain economic benefits. (5) Elementary school physical education should focus on promoting physical development, cultivating hygienic habits, and promoting a lively and natural spirit, striving for physical and mental health, to establish the foundation for healthy citizens. Physical education teaching time should be appropriately increased, and time between and after classes should be fully utilized. Physical education materials should be introduced and supplied more. Natural environments should have more contact opportunities to meet the needs of childhood. Children's hygienic life should be earnestly guided and instructed. Physical defects in children should be corrected and treated. Children's development should be notified to parents regularly to obtain cooperation. Children's physical education achievements should be established with appropriate standards and strictly assessed. (6) Middle school physical education, in addition to continuing the aim of elementary school physical education, should focus on developing basic physical fitness and cultivating applied skills, completing the work of strengthening the body and defending oneself, and starting training to defend the country. Students in vocational schools and normal schools have the same need for physical education training as students in ordinary middle schools. Therefore, their physical education goals and methods should not have any differences. The time specified in the original curriculum standards should be appropriately increased so that physical education activities can be taught as much as possible. The administration of physical education and health education in the entire school should establish a central organization for overall planning. Extracurricular exercise is an essential part of physical education training and should be strictly organized and effectively managed. Physical examination is the scientific basis for physical education facilities and should be held on time, paying attention to follow-up. Physical education grades should be made into reasonable standards so that students can self-examine their progress and improve training effectiveness. Physical education teachers should be carefully selected, physical education funding should be fully allocated, and physical education and health equipment should meet the minimum standards. (7) Physical education in colleges and universities should build on the foundation cultivated in primary and secondary schools, promote it, and pay special attention to maintaining and enhancing health and interest in sports so that when transitioning from school life to social life, these good living habits can be transferred and followed throughout life. Therefore, the training method should be light on passive teaching and heavy on active participation, abandoning general basic training and adopting a system of free elective study. All design and guidance are the responsibility of experts. The management and supervision of physical education and health should have an independent administrative organization to facilitate implementation, and students should be instructed to automatically handle extracurricular sports and group life, thereby cultivating their ability to handle affairs and respond, and increasing their service efficiency. (8) Daily life, such as diet and daily life, of students at all levels of schools should be detailed and strictly implemented to protect the health of young children. (9) Private schools and civil schools should add physical education and hygiene training.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Public Works Subsidy for Foreign Schools</h3>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works has approved the issuance of the following subsidies to foreign schools for the current year: Japanese School 139,000 yuan, Union Church Boys' School 5,000 yuan, Russian School 5,000 yuan, German School 9,000 yuan, Rochento School (transliteration) 2,500 yuan, Jewish Community School 6,000 yuan, St. Francis Xavier's School Orphanage 8,500 yuan, Union Church Girls' School 7,000 yuan, Shanghai American School 8,000 yuan, totaling 190,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The National Government Commends the Late Professor Wu Mei of National Central University</h3>
<p>And Settles 3,000 Yuan of Compensation</p>
<p>Chongqing, 20th - The National Government issued an order on the 20th to commend the late Professor Wu Mei of National Central University. The original order stated: Professor Wu Mei of National Central University was upright and of high moral character. He had long been dedicated to the study of phonology and obtained the essence of the Northern School. At that time, he imbued revolutionary ideas in his writings and spread them through vocal music. Subsequently, he served as a professor at various universities, writing tirelessly and expounding on the study of rhyme, which not only contributed to the arts but also surpassed previous scholars. It is deeply regrettable to hear of his passing. He should be given a commendation and a special settlement of 3,000 yuan to recognize his scholarship and encourage future generations. This order.</p>
<h3>Army University Student Qiu Yangwu Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Vehicle Overturns in Guizhou</p>
<p>A group of students from the Army University, acting under orders, traveled from Zunyi to Chongqing on the third of this month. While their vehicle passed through a mountain in Tongzi County, Guizhou, due to the driver's negligence, the vehicle overturned. Those killed at the scene included the young military strategist Qiu Yangwu and six others, with more than ten people suffering minor and serious injuries. Qiu's brother, Jingwu, heard the news in Shanghai and was deeply saddened. Qiu was a native of Chongming, Jiangsu. In the winter of 1933, he graduated from the eighth term, second detachment, artillery department of the Central Military Academy. The following year, he went to Jiangxi to study under General Ying Zhu, followed the army to Guiyang and Chongqing, and served as an adjutant. In the winter of 1936, he was admitted to the Army University, accumulating merits to become an artillery colonel. After August 13th, he moved west with the school. He was about to graduate this spring when he died in the vehicle overturning. His ambitions were unfulfilled, which is regrettable. He left behind a son and a daughter, the daughter being four years old and the son not yet a year old. His wife, Ms. Wang Yun, is currently in Zunyi, and her situation is extremely bleak.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Prevents Japanese Puppet Regime from Implementing Enslavement Education</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) The Jiangsu Education Department, considering that the Japanese puppet regime actively implements enslavement education after occupying each place, using all means of coercion and inducement, and that a group of unemployed teachers are forced by life to be driven by it, and some unconscionable people are willing to be tigers and accomplices, assisting the evildoers in running so-called "schools" and implementing enslavement education, which is an obstacle to the future of the War of Resistance, has issued an order to its subordinates to try to prevent it, and ordered education administrative personnel in each county to implement the War of Resistance education. The various measures are recorded below.</p>
<p>Formulating a School Survey Form - The Jiangsu Education Department has specially created a school survey form for all levels of schools in the occupied areas, such as schools established by the enemy puppet regime, investigating the situation of their operations and the names of the principals and teachers, and issued an order to the supervisors of each district and the school inspectors of each county to be responsible for the investigation to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Implementation of War of Resistance Education - Education administrative personnel in each county in the guerrilla area should try to contact all levels of schools in the area that have resumed classes on their own, encourage them to implement War of Resistance Education, and provide appropriate subsidies to schools with excellent performance.</p>

<h3>This City's Spiritual Mobilization Association Was Commended by the Head Office in a Telegram Today Is Culture Circle's Propaganda Day Publishing a Declaration to Complete the Mission of One's Position</h3>
<p>The National Spiritual Mobilization Association of All Circles in This City, after its formal establishment on March 22 this year, immediately telegraphed President Jiang of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association to report the establishment process and the work situation. Recently, the Association received a reply telegram from Secretary-General Zhang Yuejun of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association, which was very comforting. Now, it is recorded as follows: To the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of All Circles in Shanghai City, I have read your good telegram. National spiritual mobilization is indeed an important strategy for resisting the war and building the nation. Shanghai has been mired for a long time, and the temptation and threat of the cunning invaders are even worse. Arouse the spirit of patriotism, cheer for the War of Resistance, is especially necessary. Your Association leads the masses, organizes the Association, and uses the inherent occupational groups of all circles to widely establish lasting institutions to promote the work separately, with profound planning, which is worthy of praise. Your preparatory filing is approved. It is hoped that you will continue your efforts and persevere. This is our great hope. Zhang Qun respectfully bowed,</p>
<h3>Cultural Declaration</h3>
<p>Today is Cultural Circle's Propaganda Day, and all newspapers and magazines in the city have unanimously mobilized to prepare to complete the mission of their positions. Now, a declaration is recorded as follows: Today is the National Spiritual Mobilization Cultural Circle's Propaganda Day. We, cultural comrades, are members of the nation and should actively participate in the Spiritual Mobilization Movement and solemnly swear to abide by the National Covenant to fully practice the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline promulgated by the Central Government. Culture is originally the spiritual industry of the country and the nation, and the cause done by the cultural circle is also the spiritual cause of the country and the nation. Therefore, the responsibility of us, cultural comrades, to promote National Spiritual Mobilization is particularly important. Now, based on the views of comrades, we will speak separately. The three major elements of war are manpower, financial resources, and military power. This is generally recognized. Manpower is the integrating and leading force of these three major elements, and spirit is the original driving force of all manpower. Specifically, spirit is the comprehensive, integrative, creative, and initiating force of human behavior. The so-called spiritual mobilization is to concentrate our comprehensive, integrative, creative, and initiating forces, striving towards the three common goals of national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, military first, victory first, and concentration of will, concentration of strength, to complete the sacred task of resisting the war and building the nation. First of all, we must understand the necessity of resisting the war and building the nation. We cannot deny that for the past two hundred years, our nation has indeed been declining. In the past, we have repeatedly suffered from foreign aggression, ceding land and paying reparations, and losing sovereignty, and we are almost no longer a country. However, we still live in peace and do not strive for prosperity, so that the enemy takes advantage of the situation and invades our territory. Since the Eastern sleeping lion roared at Lugou Bridge, after more than twenty-one months of War of Resistance experience, we deeply know that only resisting the war can maintain the independence, freedom, and peace of the Chinese nation. Only building the nation can consolidate and build the foundation of the difficult Republic of China. At the same time, international events have also fully proved that not resisting aggression will inevitably lead to the tragedy of national subjugation, and that compromise with the aggressor is tantamount to seeking skin with a tiger, which will inevitably harm oneself. From this point of view, we should continue to resist the war and build the nation, which is beyond doubt. Our problem is how to concentrate the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, with the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and strive to struggle to achieve the final victory. The task of resisting the war and building the nation is originally the duty of every citizen. We cultural comrades have always been admired by our compatriots as outstanding members of the nation, and the responsibility for resisting the war and building the nation is naturally even greater. When the National Spiritual Mobilization is launched, we should vow to abide by the National Covenant and should check our own lives, so that all behaviors can comply with the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and its implementation measures. We are all workers in the cultural cause, that is, promoters of the spiritual cause. Our brain is the agency that issues orders for our behavior, our mouth and pen are our sharp weapons, and our limbs are our tools for riding horses to kill the enemy and getting off horses to write proclamations. From now on, we respectfully dedicate our entire lives to the country and the nation. As for the implementation measures, we have other regulations, so I will not elaborate on them. Hereby this declaration.</p>

<h3>Amicable Negotiations Resolve Misunderstandings: Flag Dispute Resolved, French Concession Shops Reopen, Arrested Individuals Released Sequentially, National Flag Retrieved by Ratepayers' Association</h3>
<p>Following the French Concession authorities' interference with the flag-hanging incident, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession persuaded shops to reopen first. Shops complied with this advice and resumed business from the afternoon of yesterday. The Ratepayers' Association also negotiated with the French Municipal Police Headquarters, and the arrested citizens were released sequentially yesterday. The national flag was retrieved by the Ratepayers' Association with a letter. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Urge Reopening</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession issued urgent notices separately yesterday morning to urge the reopening of shops in the French Concession. The notices are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notice: China and France have always maintained cordial relations. This flag-hanging dispute was caused by the excessive actions of the Annamese police in the performance of their duties. All sectors regret this. In addition to telegraphing the government to negotiate, we urge all shops to reopen immediately and await a legal and reasonable resolution with a steadfast and resolute attitude. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<p>Ratepayers' Association Notice: Regarding the flag-hanging incident, this association has already dispatched representatives to discuss solutions with the French authorities. For the sake of Sino-French relations, we urge all shops to share the difficulties and resume business as usual to prevent the situation from escalating and to facilitate progress. This is our sincere hope. This notice.</p>
<p>Ratepayers' Association Negotiations Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession sent representatives Qu Zhenhua, Dai Chunfeng, and Gong Jingyan to negotiate the interference with the flag-hanging incident. They first met with the Police Commissioner of the French Municipal Police Headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Deputy Commissioner Rauberger received them. In addition to stating the opinions of the merchants and residents, the three representatives requested: (1) the immediate release of all arrested individuals; (2) the return of all confiscated national flags to the shops by the police; and (3) the freedom to hang flags during commemorative holidays in the future, with the hope that the police would not interfere. Deputy Commissioner Rauberger indicated that he would relay the representatives' opinions to the Commissioner and respond again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The three representatives then went again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and discussed solutions with Commissioner Haber: (1) The arrested individuals would be released immediately; (2) The national flags at the police station would be retrieved by the Ratepayers' Association with a letter; and (3) Regarding the request for citizens' freedom to hang flags without interference, as this was not within the police station's authority, a request should be made directly to the French Consul-General.</p>
<p>Shops Comply with Advice and Announce Reopening</p>
<p>After the interference with the flag-hanging incident occurred in the French Concession, merchants and residents, motivated by patriotism, spontaneously closed their shops. A reporter from the Xin Sheng She visited the French Concession yesterday morning to investigate the closed shops. The areas with the most closures were from Rue du Consulat to Ba Xian Qiao. In addition, many shops on Ximen Road, Caishi Road, Route Cardinal Mercier, and Avenue Haig were also closed, expressing their determination to fight for national honor. Although the police authorities dispatched senior French police officers to various closed areas to persuade them to reopen, they refused to accept due to the lack of a satisfactory resolution to the case. Around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, upon hearing that the arrested individuals had been released and receiving the notices from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association urging reopening, many members of the Ratepayers' Association personally went to various shops to persuade them. They gradually reopened. However, due to the late hour, it was not possible to notify everyone, and it is expected that all shops will reopen this morning.</p>
<p>Release of Arrested Individuals</p>
<p>Over 30 shop owners, employees, or residents were arrested in the flag-hanging incident the day before yesterday. The number of injured could not be immediately counted as they were scattered in various locations. However, according to police sources, one Annamese policeman and one Chinese policeman were injured. After negotiations by the Ratepayers' Association, the arrested individuals were released in succession around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It was reported that most of them endured hunger strikes while detained at the police station, fully demonstrating their patriotic zeal. However, two of the arrested individuals were initially not allowed to be released by the police due to their shouting slogans and writing slogans. After repeated negotiations, they were banished outside the concession.</p>
<p>Bank Association Consoles Fellow Banks</p>
<p>Due to the flag-hanging dispute in the French Concession the day before yesterday, various banks within the concession, such as the China Land Reclamation Bank, also raised the national flag, resulting in similar interference. The Shanghai Banking Association discussed this matter yesterday. While expressing condolences and sympathy to member banks that had been subjected to interference with flag-hanging, they also urged them to reopen first and await a resolution through diplomatic channels and matters of national importance. The banks, feeling the sincere encouragement of the association, resumed business as usual. It was also reported that the license of the Golden Gate Theatre was revoked but has been returned, and it is scheduled to reopen today.</p>
<p>Commander Xie's Letter to Compatriots Yesterday</p>
<p>Xie Jinyuan, Commander of the 800 Heroes regiment, issued a letter to compatriots yesterday regarding the crackdown on the display of the national flag, mainly stating: Yesterday, in response to the National Government's spirit of total mobilization movement, the citizens of the concession unanimously displayed the flag in commemoration, which was cracked down upon by the French Concession authorities, resulting in disputes. The national flag represents the dignity of a country, and every citizen has the freedom and right to display the national flag. Compatriots, your heroic and courageous actions, protecting the country, and supporting the supreme leader are deeply admired by the world. In my previous article "Reflections on the Past Year and Thoughts on the Current Situation," I said that from now on, Chinese people should uphold the principle of "national survival is the responsibility of every individual," each guarding their post, doing their duty to the fullest, taking the supreme leader's propositions as their own, taking their will as their own, and working diligently and practically to serve the country. Compatriots in the isolated island, as the year begins, I hope everyone will review the responsibilities they have fulfilled in the year and a half of the war of resistance. At a time when millions of frontline soldiers are facing death and hundreds of millions of compatriots in the war zone are displaced and destitute, can compatriots in the isolated island stand idly by because of their special circumstances? I deeply hope that compatriots in the isolated island will intensify their responsibility to serve the motherland, contributing money if they have money, and contributing strength if they have strength, to complete the foundation of national mobilization. Today, I sincerely appeal again to compatriots in the isolated island. The suffering we are experiencing today is the darkness before dawn. All evil atmospheres will be swept away with the great and glorious victory of the Chinese nation. I sincerely hope that compatriots in the isolated island will uphold the sense of national survival being everyone's responsibility, contributing money and strength, and with a spirit of quick action, hard work, bitter work, and practical work, take responsibility and fulfill their duty. I hope we can encourage each other.</p>

<h3>German Community in Shanghai Celebrates Hitler's 50th Birthday: Local NSDAP Leader Ehrmann Speaks, Extolling Hitler with Praises and Eulogies</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Local Special Dispatch: Yesterday (the 20th) was the 50th birthday of Führer Hitler. The German community in Shanghai held a celebration at the German Building on Great Western Road. Approximately 1,000 people attended, including personnel from the German Embassy and Consulate, members of the NSDAP China Branch, and leaders of various German organizations. Ehrmann, leader of the NSDAP China Branch, delivered a speech, praising Hitler's achievements. He stated that never in history has there been anyone as enthusiastically supported and blessed as Hitler. At the same time, no leaders of any country have contributed as much to their nation as Hitler. When Hitler came to power six years ago, Germany was still in the midst of storms and turmoil. Now, it fears no threat from any storm. Ehrmann then strongly refuted the anti-German propaganda in various countries, stating that Hitler's policy has always been one of peace. Because he participated in the war for four years, he knows the cruelty of war and is determined not to start a war. Except for annexing Austria, Sudetenland, and Memel to save his fellow countrymen, there is absolutely no plan to annex the territories of different nationalities. This can be proven by the Munich Conference last September and Hitler's repeated guarantees. Ehrmann then discussed the annexation of Bohemia (i.e., the Czech Republic) and Moravia, as well as the relationship between Germany and Britain. He concluded by stating that Hitler's slogan is peace, and the tool for maintaining peace is a sharp sword. We pray that God blesses us and does not use the sword. But if Hitler is forced to use the sword to save Germany and the world, then we are ready to obey his orders at any time.</p>
<h3>Rice Reserves Increase, Market Prices Stabilize: Over 10,000 More Bags Compared to Last Period, Smooth Supply with Goods Arriving Continuously</h3>
<p>The Rice Evaluation Committee, jointly formed by seven rice industry groups including the Bean and Rice Industry, completed its third survey of rice reserves on the 16th of this month. The total amount of rice reserves was 654,087 bags, an increase of 15,540 bags compared to the previous period. According to rice industry insiders, since rice industry groups persuaded merchants to purchase domestic rice, the supply has gradually become smoother. In recent days, shipments have been arriving by both land and water routes, averaging over 10,000 bags per day, and goods are still arriving continuously. Generally, cargo owners, seeing that the reserves and arrivals are abundant, are lowering prices for medium-grade and heat-sensitive goods to sell them off. Therefore, market transaction prices have been suppressed, and retail prices at various rice stores have also stabilized. Based on the current situation, it is estimated that Shanghai's reserves will continue to increase, and the future of food supply can be considered secure.</p>
<h3>Fishermen Urge Resumption of Ningbo-Dinghai Fishing Route: Fishermen's Livelihoods Ruined, Dinghai Severely Affected</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Fishery Association telegraphed Gu, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, and Huang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating: Since the 6th, the Ningbo River has been ordered to be closed. Now, during the fishing season, fishing boats are not allowed to enter, and their livelihoods are ruined. Some are tempted by the false fish market in Shanghai, which greatly affects the future of the war of resistance. The Preparatory Committee, based on the requests of representatives from various county fishery associations, telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission through the Association (Chairman) to promptly order the Ningbo Defense Command to investigate and allow fishing boats to pass through to benefit the fishing industry. It is also reported that Dinghai, with a population of over 400,000, has been severely affected since the shipping route was suspended. They submitted a request to the county government the day before yesterday to allow the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Dinghai, designating commercial ships to operate to facilitate transportation.</p>

<h3>Rumored Puppet "Mayor" Criticizes Concession Police, Raises Unreasonable Demands, "Protests" to the Consular Body and the Municipal Council Yesterday, Demands "Condolences" for the Murder of Xi Shitai, Disregards the Dignity of the Municipal Council's Police Force</h3>
<p>Rumored puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an reportedly raised three unreasonable demands to the Consular Body and the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday (the 19th). The demands were absurd and bizarre. The following is an excerpt of his "protest" letter and the so-called three demands:</p>
<p>Suspects the Concession's Police Force</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Your Consular Body and Your Municipal Council bear a great responsibility for maintaining peace and order within the Concession. Xi Shitai, the secretary of the Police Bureau of this "Government," was shot by thugs near his residence at No. 12 Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road, Public Concession, at 9:15 AM on April 10. This "Mayor" sincerely regrets the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident. In view of the repeated assassinations in both concessions, which are of a seriously rebellious nature against the "new regime," and for the sake of maintaining "order" in Shanghai, this "Mayor" issued a serious "protest" on March 10 of this year. The main purpose was to severely prohibit such illegal terrorist acts and prevent similar incidents from happening again. Five demands were submitted for investigation and implementation. It has been many days since then, and no reply has been received, which is a lack of good faith and deeply regrettable. Now, this unfortunate incident has occurred again. This "Mayor" believes that Your Consular Body and Your Municipal Council lack sufficient "sincerity" in maintaining security within the Concession, and questions how your efforts to search for and prevent criminals are being carried out.</p>
<p>Raises Three Unreasonable Demands</p>
<p>Regarding the assassination of Xi Shitai, this "Mayor" specifically inquires about the responsibility of Your Consular Body and Your Municipal Council and makes the following three demands, hoping that you will maintain the full tranquility of the Public Concession in the future and provide a definite guarantee. The demands are as follows: (1) Regarding the repeated assassinations in the Public Concession, Your Municipal Council's regular bureau has made omissions in preventing such incidents from happening. Based on the facts of this unfortunate incident, this "Mayor" specifically asks Your Municipal Council authorities about the responsibilities they bear. (2) Your bureau has the responsibility to suppress illegal terrorist acts. Now, because you have failed to fulfill your responsibilities, this unfortunate incident has occurred. You must request methods to "console" the bereaved family of the victim, Xi Shitai. (3) This "Municipal Government" police, in order to eradicate illegal acts within the Public Concession, wishes to cooperate with the Municipal Council's police personnel in inspecting and investigating illegal organizations within the Concession. Please promptly reply to the above demands, together with this "Mayor"'s demands of March 10. This is my sincere hope. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Police Department: Promotion of Japanese Police Officers; Japanese Personnel Promoted to Foreign Police Department with Equal Status to British Personnel; Discontented Remarks from Foreign Police Department Personnel</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the Public Works Bureau Police Department headquarters in the Public Settlement issued a police order yesterday (the 19th) around 6:00 PM, changing the Japanese Police Department to the Second Team of the Foreign Police Department. This move means that Japanese personnel in the Police Department have been promoted to the Foreign Police Department, and their salaries have increased by more than 35%. What is particularly important is that, according to</p>
<p>the order's provisions,</p>
<p>Japanese police officers now have the qualifications to receive the same salary and status as British police officers. If they pass the prescribed examination, they can enter the First Team of the Foreign Police Department. Regarding the salary increase, Japanese police officers in the Police Department previously received 120 yuan per month. According to this new arrangement, they will receive 170 yuan per month, an increase of more than 35%, which is only 50 yuan less than the starting monthly salary of 120 yuan for new British police officers. However, if Japanese police officers pass the necessary examination, they can also receive</p>
<p>the same salary.</p>
<p>It is heard that the salaries of other ranks in the new team of the Foreign Police Department are also increased to the same extent. Last night, the police community discussed this new order extensively, and there were discontented remarks among the Foreign Police Department personnel. At the same time, all preparations for the implementation of the new order from May 1st have been completed.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Confer on Rickshaw Rent Issues</h3>
<p>Accumulated Photo Fees of 240,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Proposed to be Allocated for Anti-Japanese and Relief Expenses</p>
<p>Since the rickshaw pullers opposed the rickshaw companies' rent increase and demanded a 30% rent reduction, all rickshaw pullers have unanimously responded. In order to strengthen unity, concentrate will, and unify organization, the rickshaw pullers specially convened representatives from various districts yesterday (the 19th) at 2:00 PM for an important meeting to discuss various action plans. In addition to detailed plans and thorough arrangements for the second step of response, the representatives also raised three issues for discussion: (A) The representatives believe that the past work has achieved considerable results and has achieved initial victory, but there are still many difficulties ahead. The representatives and all rickshaw pullers are determined to continue their efforts and redouble their efforts to achieve their goals. (B) The representatives believe that it is necessary to have an organized group at present. However, after repeated discussions on the issue of name, the representatives decided to use the "Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association" as the organization representing all rickshaw pullers, and resolved that all expenses would be borne by the representatives, and no money would be collected from any rickshaw pullers to show credibility. (C) Since the "August 13th" War of Resistance, the Rickshaw Trade Association has not donated rickshaw licenses in the Chinese area, totaling 9,500 vehicles. The monthly license fee per vehicle is 1.28 yuan in national currency, and the monthly license fee should be 12,160 yuan in national currency. Calculated over 20 months, the association should have accumulated 243,200 yuan in national currency. Now that the association charges rickshaw rental fees at the original price of 0.77 yuan before "August 13th," and even illegally increases it to more than 0.80 yuan in most cases, it should pay the Chinese area donation to the government monthly as usual and remit it to Chongqing to cover the cost of the War of Resistance. Otherwise, it should also be issued to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to cover the cost of disaster relief. It was resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to make a suggestion, and to ask the association to actively negotiate with the trade association to collect the funds. Finally, it was unanimously resolved to submit another petition to the Public Works Bureau requesting that it uphold justice and accept the rickshaw pullers' demands as soon as possible to end the dispute.</p>
<h3>Chen Cipu of the Central Relief Committee Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chen Cipu, the former supervisor of students studying in Japan, was hired by the Central Relief Committee after completing his studies in Japan last year and has been working in Hong Kong for more than four months. Recently, the central government has been concerned about the relief of refugees in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, so Deputy Chairman Xu Shiying sent Mr. Chen to inspect the situation. He arrived in Shanghai several days ago and took a boat from Shanghai yesterday. He is scheduled to return to Hong Kong after two months of inspection. The Central Relief Committee has telegraphed the local military and political leaders to assist with his inspection destinations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai YMCA Opens Vocational Lectures</h3>
<p>Vocational youth in this city often cannot cope with their service due to insufficient knowledge and weak abilities, and they feel all kinds of difficulties. They want to increase their knowledge, but they have no appropriate methods in terms of time and economy. In order to meet this need, the Shanghai YMCA is now opening vocational lectures and has specially hired social leaders and celebrities to serve as lecturers every evening, such as Lu Gaoyi, general manager of the World Book Company, Ma Chonggan, editor of the Shen Bao, Huang Zongyu, professor of Jiaotong University, Li Quanshi, editor-in-chief of the Bank Weekly, and Tu Zheyin, professor of Daxia University, and more than a dozen others who are willing to provide sincere guidance. In terms of courses, there are 12 courses including industrial and commercial management law, magazine editing law, insurance management law, news interviewing law, practical commercial law, product marketing law, customs declaration and transportation law, advertising soliciting law, bank management law, foreign exchange law, import and export trade law, and library management law. Classes are held from 7:00 to 9:00 PM every Monday to Saturday evening at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. Each week is a term, and the tuition fee for each course per term is one yuan. The opening date has been set for May 1st. Registration can be made at the two YMCA locations. Briefs are available for filing. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for vocational youth in society to study.</p>
<h3>Directors of the French Chamber of Commerce Will Host a Banquet for the French Ambassador Tomorrow Evening; The Ambassador Expresses That the Chinese Government's War of Resistance Can Achieve Brightness; The Cordial Relationship Between China and France Should Correct Interference in Flag Hanging</h3>
<p>The directors and all members of the French General Assembly of the French Concession on Huanlong Road in this city have been in Shanghai for nearly a decade since the arrival of the new French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme. In order to clarify the general situation for Ambassador Cosme regarding the situation of France in China, a public banquet will be held in the Assembly Hall of the Assembly at 6:30 to 7:30 PM tomorrow. Ambassador Cosme arrived in Chongqing on March 5th this year and presented his credentials to Chairman Lin. He stayed in Chongqing for five days and successively visited Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, etc., and then went to Kunming on the 22nd. He transferred to Haiphong and arrived in Shanghai by the D'Artois gunboat from Hong Kong. This is the second time that Ambassador Cosme has come to China. In 1927, he was a member of the embassy in Beiping. He has always maintained friendly relations with the Chinese government. Regarding the future of China's War of Resistance, Ambassador Cosme said, "China will surely achieve the arrival of brightness." Unexpectedly, not long after Ambassador Cosme arrived in Shanghai, the authorities of the French Concession sent police to interfere with the hanging of flags in the concession, causing disputes and forming a temporary suspension of business. This is certainly not Ambassador Cosme's wish, and it is hoped that it can be corrected. It is heard that the shops in the French Concession have jointly appealed to Ambassador Cosme.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings of Past Dynasties; Exhibition Period of Five Days</h3>
<p>The Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition of Past Dynasties is an unprecedented group exhibition by more than 50 famous collectors in Shanghai. The famous works collected from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, reaching more than 350 works, are all masterpieces that represent the highest peaks of art of each writer's life and generation. Since the 18th, the exhibition hall has been expanded, works have been added, and more than 100 works have been replaced, and many rare treasures that were finally collected have been added. The tickets are still sold for one yuan each and are not increased. The number of people who came to visit in the past two days broke the record of previous days. The number of foreign guests who came was also more than in the past. The groups who came were Daxia, Soochow, and Zhijiang Universities, Jiangsu Provincial Normal School, which moved from Wuxi to Shanghai, Changzhou Middle School, Jiangsu Higher Court, Shanghai China and Huayi Banks, and the Chinese Business Securities Exchange, and more than ten other groups. As a result, the already expanded venue was still crowded due to the large number of people. The exhibition period was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but the association decided to extend the exhibition period for five days until the 25th and will not extend it again due to the enthusiastic demands of all walks of life and the consent of the collectors. Those who love art should not miss this last good opportunity. In addition, the association welcomes groups to visit during the exhibition period, but hopes to notify in advance in order to arrange the visiting time so that the number of people in the venue can be adjusted and avoid being too crowded.</p>
<h3>Five Students Go to Ningbo to Join the Army</h3>
<p>Persuaded to Return Due to Young Age</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there has been no shortage of patriotic people who have joined the army to defend the country. Now there are five students from the Shaoxing Shanghai Middle School, which is set up by the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, namely Wang Lijun, 16 years old, Zhang Zuigen, 15 years old, Zhang Jiuru, 14 years old, Zhang Yousheng, 15 years old, and Cai Wenjun, 17 years old. All five suddenly disappeared on the 3rd of this month. After many inquiries, it was learned that the five students went to Ningbo with Lan Shijie, Yang Jiong, etc., intending to abandon their studies and join the army. After the school found out the truth, it was believed that the students were still young and needed to continue their studies, so it telegraphed Director Yu of the Ningbo Police Bureau to ask the police to pay attention. At the same time, it sent investigator Gu Xun to Ningbo to supervise. They have been found in the World Hotel on Jiangzuo Street in Ningbo. After persuasion by Director Yu, they have returned to Shanghai by boat with investigator Gu.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves Measures for Shipping Chicken Feathers to Shanghai</h3>

<p>The ban on the shipment of chicken feathers from Zhejiang Province to Shanghai has affected the business and the livelihood of coolies of chicken feather shops in this city, such as Wang Shunxing, Zhu Wanxing, Hexing, and Chen Fuxing.

<h3>Japanese Man Shot and Wounded in a Hollywood Gambling Den; Seriously Injured and Sent to Fumin Hospital for Treatment; The Cause is Unknown and the Japanese Police are Currently Investigating</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, last night (the 19th), it was heard that a Japanese man was shot and wounded in the Hollywood gambling den in the Chinese area near Yuyu Road around 8:00 PM.

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Suffered a Miserable Defeat in Guanyintang Town; Guerrillas Attacked from Both Sides; Dozens of Japanese Soldiers Killed and Wounded</h3>
<p>Guanyintang Town, Qingyi, west of Xinjingdian in northwestern Shanghai, was originally the base of the guerrilla force of the Seventh District Chief Wang Shilong. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 AM on the 16th, about 60 to 70 Japanese and puppet soldiers of the garrison commander Matsuoka's troops stationed in Xujing Town on Qinghu Road, led by Zhu Juren, the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" of Panlong, went to Guanyintang Town to search. Wang Shilong knew about it in advance, so he moved all his troops to ambush in the villages south of the town to cut off their retreat. At the same time, he sent a flying message to Gu Fusheng's troops, the district chief and guerrilla squadron leader of the Eighth District, to attack from the north. On that day, after the Japanese and puppet soldiers arrived, they searched the residents of the town door to door. As a result, they found nothing, so they set fire to more than ten houses of the Zhang family. When the flames soared, the two district chiefs Gu and Wang immediately gave an order, and the brave soldiers from the north and south attacked from both sides, using machine guns and hand grenades to kill and attack. The Japanese and puppet soldiers responded in a hurry, firing back. After a fierce battle for about an hour, the Japanese and puppet soldiers were defeated and retreated to the south. After walking about half a mile, they approached Dujiazhai, and the ambush soldiers of Wang Shilong's troops, who were ambushed there, also rushed out from both sides. The Japanese and puppet soldiers were caught off guard, had no intention of fighting, and fled in all directions in a mess. In this battle, more than 40 Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed and wounded, and two portable machine guns and more than 20 rifles were seized. Some Chinese also sacrificed their lives for the country.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Director of the Unified Tax Office" Yang Qiguan Stabbed with a Knife; A Strong Man Broke into the Bedroom in the Early Morning and Struck Four Times, Life in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>The anti-traitor blood case that occurred at 4:40 AM the day before yesterday at No. 101 Yuyuan Road (No. 109 in the Chinese area) was caused by Yang Qiguan, a Cantonese man who was the "Director of the Taxation Office of the Ministry of Finance of the Reformed Government," also known as Jing'an, 52 years old, who owned a private car No. 4816. In the early morning of the day before yesterday, when Yang's family was fast asleep, a strong man broke into Yang's bedroom on the third floor from the balcony of the neighbor, pulled out a sharp knife and struck Yang in the face, head, neck, and right hand. When he saw Yang's child crying loudly, the strong man calmly left. Afterwards, Yang's family sent Yang to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, and then transferred him to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. His life is in danger. Yang's family also moved to another place after the incident, and only left a servant at home to guard the gate.</p>
<h3>Qin Songru Embezzles Fines; Embezzled 1,400 Yuan from a Woman and Should Compensate the Plaintiff for Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>Qin Chunru from Ningbo previously committed rape of a dance girl in the Yangtze Hotel ballroom. Because Qin Chunru failed to appear in court after being summoned by the Special First Court, he could not be arrested, so the case is still in suspension. Now, Qin Songru has been accused of</p>
<p>embezzling 1,200 yuan from Zhang Lv, a woman (Hao Zhang Embroidery Record), in the Criminal Court of the First Court. Zhang Lv had known Qin Songru for a long time. She had 1,400 yuan in the Bank of China. When the war broke out in September 1937, she planned to move back to her native Ningbo and needed money to use, so she entrusted Qin Songru to take the</p>
<p>deposit out of the Bank of China on her behalf. At that time, Qin immediately gave her a check for 1,400 yuan. However, because she could not cash the check, Qin volunteered to</p>
<p>exchange it for cash on her behalf. Unexpectedly, after Qin obtained the check, he disappeared. After searching for a long time, Qin finally claimed that the money had been used by him and</p>
<p>begged her to</p>
<p>repay it in installments, and made a note as proof. Then, except for the 200 yuan that had been repaid, the remaining amount has not been repaid to this day. She had no choice but to hire lawyer Ni Guangzu to file a lawsuit against Qin Songru in the Special First Court for embezzlement, requesting that he be punished in accordance with Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and incidentally</p>
<p>file a civil lawsuit</p>
<p>requesting that he be ordered to repay 1,200 yuan in national currency and the statutory interest from September 6, 1937, to the end of the execution. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Zhong Qing. Qin Songru also surrendered to court for questioning. After questioning by Judge Zhong, he ruled that Qin Songru should be fined 100 yuan, and if he was commuted to labor, he would be converted to two yuan per day, and he should also return 1,200 yuan to the plaintiff and the statutory interest.</p>

It was learned that the bandits had stolen objects from 16 factories, so they were escorted to the court yesterday to request an extension.

The fire spread to the interior of the room, and the raw materials were all flammable. Once on fire, it was out of control. Although the firefighters tried their best to rescue it, it was of little effect. Five or six bungalows were all burned down.

<h3>Describing Obscene Men and Women, the Editor is Fined 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The small publication "Five Clouds Rising Sun Building" at No. 59 Hong Kong Road, Room 301, is edited by Gu Huaibing from Changzhou. The text published on April 1st of this publication contains an article called "Soul-Stirring Rhymes," which describes obscene men and women. After being found out by the Political Department of the Public Works Bureau, Hua Tan Zizhang Yi asked the Special First Court to issue a summons and summoned Gu to the Criminal Fourth Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him in accordance with Article 235 of the Criminal Law. Gu Huaihui confessed that he was not in Shanghai when this issue was published, which caused this negligence, so he requested a pardon, and hired lawyer Yu Zhong to defend him. After questioning by Judge Dai Rongduo, he ruled that Gu Huaibing should be fined 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Young Man Unemployed Reports Poisoning</h3>
<p>Wu Jinxiang, 26 years old from Haiyan, Zhejiang, has been unemployed recently, which has caused him to feel thorned and suddenly have a pessimistic view of the world. At 8:00 PM on the 19th, he went to the Tongshang Inn at No. 184 Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession and opened Room 10, claiming that he was borrowing a place to stay. He committed suicide inside that night. The next day, the tea room found that he had been dead for a long time. A pair of trousers was tightly wrapped around his neck on the bed. On the table in front of the bed, there was an empty glass bottle of medicine. It is speculated that the deceased seemed to have taken poison and then strangled himself to death with a pair of trousers. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. A suicide note was copied from his body, which only contained numbers such as his cousin Chen Xiangzheng, who lived at No. 8 Hongning Lane, Caishi Road. The body was then sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue. At the same time, the deceased's cousin was notified to report to the Special Second Court today to send someone to inspect the body.</p>
<h3>Renovation of Qingyuli; 3,000 Tenants Will Face Homelessness; Tenants Request Mediation on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>Qingyuli tenants' representatives Qian Daifo, Ping Jinya, Qian Zhuyu, Zhang Mulian, Zhang Qilian, Shen Jiaping, Wang Yunquan, Zhang Jingxing, Liu Yaomei, Zhang Nianchun, Fan Chunyuan, and Fan Bozhou jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Federation of the First Special District yesterday, saying, "We respectfully inform you that our entire tenants received a letter from the Women's Bank Management Office in May of the year of cloud, stating that we have fulfilled a treaty with others, and the original houses must be renovated, please relocate, etc. After discussing among our tenants, we replied that since the outbreak of the 813 War in Shanghai, refugees from the interior have come to Shanghai to seek refuge, and the place is overcrowded. Where can we relocate? As for the renovation of the houses, it is not necessary at this time. Our tenants really cannot obey, etc. After the letter was replied, the bank still insisted on the previous proposal and continued to request relocation. After being rejected by our lane, it was not properly negotiated. On the one hand, it filed a lawsuit in court. Our tenants, standing in the position of the defendant, had to argue according to reason. After the judgment, it was deemed that the plaintiff had no reason to dismiss it. The Women's Bank, because it lost the lawsuit, appealed to the Second High Court. After many twists and turns, it has won the lawsuit in court. Thinking about it, there are more than 280 households in the entire lane, with a population of more than 3,000. After this panic, everyone is at a loss. Not only individuals will suffer from the hardship of relocation and displacement, but it is feared that it will affect social order. How can it be imagined? We have long admired your association's concern for public peace and request that you act impartially to mediate."</p>
<h3>Xinghexian Cigarette Exchange Branch Manager Arrested for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Yang Xuntai (31 years old), the manager of the Xinghexian Cigarette Exchange branch at No. 149 Guizhou Road, embezzled more than 2,000 yuan of deposits from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and the HSBC Bank between March 27 and April 14 of this year by taking advantage of his position. He also claimed that the business was not good and the turnover was not flexible, and borrowed 400 yuan in national currency from the head office. Recently, Rong Chenghao, the owner of the store, found out and reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, who arrested Yang Xuntai and escorted him to the Criminal First Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning to be prosecuted for embezzlement. Judge Jiang attended the court to question him. The defendant Yang Xuntai confessed, "It is true that I embezzled 2,883 yuan from the Xinghexian store, but I have lost it all. Now there are only 90 yuan left. Please give me a chance to change the date of the trial. I will think of a way to pay him back." Judge Jiang verified the words and instructed that the case would be rescheduled for trial in a week.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Kills Innocent People Indiscriminately</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese soldiers in Zhabei have been strictly checking the residents, fearing that guerrillas are lurking. If they encounter people without residence permits or who they think are suspicious, they do not ask for the reason and falsely accuse them of being guerrillas and take them to the headquarters for questioning. For some reason, around 5:00 PM yesterday, they tied up a man, about 30 years old, who looked like a worker. Four Japanese soldiers escorted him to the Yizhong Cemetery on Yuyingtang Road and shot him. First, they tied the man's eyes tightly with white cloth, and then ordered him to kneel on the ground and shot him three times, killing him. The body was buried in the ground at that place. According to witnesses, in the past month or two, the number of innocent men and women who have been shot and killed in that place is no less than hundreds, almost every day. However, women are only a minority.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in This City for Several Days</h3>

The fog dissipated slightly after 7:00 AM, but the sky was still filled with moisture. Looking up from a high place, it was all white, like rain but not rain, like clouds but not clouds. The ground was very humid and gradually dried up until the afternoon, but the fog did not dissipate until the evening.</p>

On the 9th of this month, while riding in a rickshaw through Caishi Road, she had a pair of diamond earrings snatched from her ears by robber Wang Baosheng and others. The diamond earrings were worth 1,400 yuan. Wang Baosheng and others took them to a pawnshop on Shanxi Road and pawned them for 400 yuan, which they split and spent. On the 14th of this month, Wang Baosheng was planning to rob again at the Taiping Bridge tram station when he was spotted by a Chinese detective from the French Concession police, who arrested him and took him to the police station. He was ordered to be detained for investigation. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:00 PM, the French police escorted Wang Baosheng to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, stating that he was being prosecuted for the crime of repeated robbery. Court President Liao then took the bench and questioned him. The defendant Wang Baosheng confessed that he had been arrested several times before for robbery. This time, the robbery of the diamond earrings was initiated by the fugitive Wu A'er, and he requested to be severely punished. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered a debate and then immediately declared the trial closed. The court sentenced Wang Baosheng to eight months of imprisonment for repeatedly robbing others of movable property.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor,</p>
<p>We recently saw in today's newspaper that several sets of military uniforms were found in our bank's Suzhou Road warehouse, which were identified as items previously mortgaged to our bank. This is not consistent with the facts. Upon investigation, the aforementioned goods have never been mortgaged to our bank and are purely a kind of entrusted item. Therefore, we have no way of knowing its contents. Our bank has absolutely no connection with it. Accordingly, we are writing to inform you and hope that you will check and make corrections.</p>

<h3>The Scope of the Anti-Aggression Alliance</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The world today has reached a point where one hair pulled affects the whole body. Whoever wants to close themselves off and watch the slaughter from the clouds cannot do so. Even trying to acquiesce to other countries, pretending to be agreeable, is not permitted by the facts. Only by throwing oneself into this great whirlpool, floating and sinking with the world, and turning either left or right, joining one side, can one no longer remain neutral. The United States, which has always ignored European affairs, now has Roosevelt repeatedly declaring intervention and has clearly joined the side of the democratic countries, which is proof of my view.</p>
<p>This means that now, every country must state its attitude and have a way to handle itself. Therefore, at the same time, the combination of several countries, such as an anti-aggression alliance, should accommodate as many like-minded countries as possible, without regard to strength, size, distance, or any other relationship, hesitating, lingering, or indecisively rejecting people at the door. The reason is simple: since it is a combination to resist the other side, the greater the power, the better, and the more allies, the better. I have repeatedly said that the anti-aggression alliance should expand its scope for this reason.</p>
<p>However, the extension of the anti-aggression alliance to the Far East is even more necessary. I have already said this before, and now, according to the Associated Press, British MP Hantson is also making such a claim: "Since the anti-communist axis has one end in East Asia, the new collective security system must include both the East and Europe to be effective." In addition, British diplomats also believe that "If the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are the second stage of establishing an anti-aggression front, then the addition of China and other Asian countries to the anti-aggression front will be the third stage." Yes, so-called anti-communism is aggression, and the self-proclaimed anti-communist countries in the Far East are already aggressing. To prevent the aggression of any country and to seek world peace, how can the Far East, especially China, be abandoned and not included in the anti-aggression alliance!</p>
<p>Chamberlain, when asked by Henderson whether the British government has decided that China and other Far Eastern countries need to join the anti-aggression grand alliance, replied, "Britain is very willing to consider this issue." I hope Chamberlain will indeed consider this issue and give it a positive decision, because this is indeed the touchstone for whether the anti-aggression alliance can be effective.</p>
<p>As for China, I believe that we are naturally happy to join this alliance, because we are now engaged in thorough anti-aggression. What's not to like about being invited to work together!</p>
<h3>Marching in the Snow</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yin</p>
<p>The sun densely hides in the depths of the mountains, revealing a trace of grayish-white light. The sky presents a terrible deathly gray, as if to swallow this huge ground. The surroundings are gloomy, like the eyes of giant beasts stretching out their claws to prey on food.</p>
<p>The north wind blows from the gaps in the mountains, from the branches of the trees, from the river surface, the plain, from all directions, rolling over the mountains, rolling over the trees, rolling over the plains and rivers, spreading its wings and sweeping, sweeping the darkness and silence of dawn.</p>
<p>At this time, there is only one kind of light, shimmering on the earth, a kind of jade-like white, crystal-like pure brilliance, as soft as wild duck down. Oh! Look! Looking out at the winding circle of mountains, a layer of silver-white things is spread flat, the broken stones on the mountains become beads of various shapes, and the withered branches suddenly seem to be full of pear blossoms, and a kind of lush white pear blossom that has never been seen before, the petals seem to be woven from silver threads. The road has also become a road paved with jewels, or a brand-new carpet covered with white down... Oh, that's snow, that's the light of snow. Surrounded by shimmering silver-white, the stream is particularly green and lovely. The clear green is like a moon in the stars, dignified, holy, and charming.</p>
<p>Faintly, the sound of the bugle rings out, the notes dancing with sadness and sorrow, movingly drifting in space.</p>
<p>In the distance, a large string of grass-green ranks appears, slowly moving forward, that rank appears on the mountain peaks, appears in the mountain gaps, appears on the opposite mountain... seemingly endless, appears in the mountains.</p>
<p>Far away, the sound of horses neighing can be heard, drawn out long, carrying a heart-wrenching desolation.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there is no other sound, only the slight rubbing sound of straw sandals stepping on the snow!</p>
<p>The congealed air is only dispersed a little, the surroundings are still gloomy, and the earth is still half-awake, with sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>On the mountains, on the road, countless messy, uneven footprints appear, slowly approaching, and the footprints become more and more numerous, engraving scars on this large piece of whiteness.</p>
<p>The sun gradually reveals a little red light from the depths of the mountains. The red sunlight shines on the white snow, changing the trees, mountains, and ground into pale pink clothes, like a magic-colored world.</p>
<p>Open your chest and take a deep breath of the morning air, fresh and fragrant, directly into the viscera. The whole body is bathed in the faint light of dawn. The cold seems to have diminished a little, and a feeling of joy and comfort that light is about to come arrives. Tens of thousands of people raise their heads, tens of thousands of hearts resonate with the same feeling. Dawn, dawn is about to come, China's victorious dawn is about to come.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people, all from the remote South. Today, they are ordered to transfer from the southeast battlefield, after a long trek of thousands of miles, crossing mountains, passing through long bridges, highways, and railways, to the north of the Yangtze River. Tens of thousands of people hold the same faith and the same aspiration. Today, they are about to begin a difficult and distant march, without any fear or fear, because their eyes have already seen the light of the motherland's victory.</p>
<p>Snow, for these healthy men from the South, is a novel thing. They have never seen anything so bright, so white, so clean, so soft. It is simply a dream scene, a myth. Most of them have never left home. Only a few have followed the army on the northern expedition twelve years ago, seen snow...</p>
<p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..." Tens of thousands of people are marching in the snow, the sun is shining with warm light, the sky is no longer a deathly gray, and the gloom around it has also been dispelled. The light of the snow, the light of the sun, are intertwined into a bright and victorious omen.</p>
<p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..." The ranks are moving forward.</p>
<p>The bugle is sounding again, majestic and solemn.</p>
<h3>Digging Trenches</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhi</p>
<p>Now our guerrillas have become very powerful, and the Japanese troops are feeling uneasy day and night. News of attacks is constantly entering the enemy's camp, and they are all fearful and can only dig deep trenches and build high fortresses to strengthen their defensive work. Therefore, the need to dig trenches has become urgent.</p>
<p>Digging trenches requires a large amount of labor, so they go to the countryside and forcibly drag people into labor everywhere. When they arrive at a house, they see a man, whether old or strong, and tie them up with clumsy hemp ropes, one after another, string after string, pulling them away.</p>
<p>While walking on the way, they are not allowed to shout or cry. If they violate these two "orders," they will be given a good beating. If anyone tries to escape, they will be shot immediately. After arriving at their destination, each person is given an iron hoe or hoe, and they are ordered to start working and digging in the designated place, digging and digging continuously!</p>
<p>In the evening, it is time to rest. The place to sleep is the trench that they have dug with their own labor. Moisture and cold wind are constantly attacking from above, and water and mud are chilling their hungry skin below. Hungry stomachs and tired bodies huddle together in piles, and it is uneasy to stand, sit, or lie down. There will not be a minute of sleep all night.</p>
<p>Before dawn, they are ordered to work again: dig! dig! Dig continuously!</p>
<p>As for eating, there is only one meal a day, and each person has only one bowl of rice, weighing only four taels. Not only is there no dish, but there is no soup, and there are not even chopsticks. So, should we grab it with our hands? No! Their "order" is that they are not allowed to grab it with their hands, but can only "lick" it with their mouths like a dog eating shit! Whoever dares to grab it with their hands will be stabbed with a bayonet immediately, which is still a "light punishment," and sometimes they will be shot!</p>
<p>When it is time to urinate or defecate, they are not allowed to leave the trench a step. The "order" is to "excrete" in the trench.</p>
<p>While working, they are not allowed to talk or laugh, and even crying is not allowed. The "order" is to be silent! Whenever they see a Japanese supervisor coming, whoever sees them must bow and smile. Otherwise, it will be considered impolite and they will definitely be slapped twice.</p>
<p>Anyone who dies because they cannot bear the hard work, hunger, and cold, or who violate the "order" and are beaten or killed, the "order" does not allow burial. The corpses are used as soil and piled on top of the trenches, considered to be thickening the earthen fortifications.</p>
<p>In short, the compatriots who are dragged away are all sacrificed in the trenches: working in the trenches, sleeping in the trenches, urinating and defecating in the trenches, and dying and being buried in the trenches! It is a pity that there are still some unburied compatriots who are still forced by the enemy to dig for them! dig! Dig continuously!</p>
<h3>Not a Single Link Can Be Loosened</h3>
<h3>Don't Often Gaze in the Mirror</h3>
<p>— Guo Nidi</p>
<p>The rhythm of the universe cycles endlessly,</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours continue day and night.</p>
<p>The youth that fades away can never return,</p>
<p>Don't often gaze in the mirror at your beautiful face.</p>
<p>Life is originally a broad and diverse stage,</p>
<p>The myriad forms of living beings each reach the extreme of ugliness and beauty.</p>
<p>Playing the fool, inserting jokes, fulfilling your duties as much as possible,</p>
<p>Without extravagant desires, without troubles, and without indifference.</p>
<p>Understanding the simplicity of the essence from complex phenomena,</p>
<p>In this way, the journey has a fixed path to follow.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the earth and stars will collide in chaos,</p>
<p>And all the myriad things of nature will perish together in an instant.</p>
<p>Don't often gaze in the mirror at your beautiful face,</p>
<p>The youth that fades away can never return,</p>
<p>Beauty is a sign of premature aging,</p>
<p>Only wisdom can radiate eternal light.</p>
<h3>On the Peak</h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>Crossing the dangerous and steep slopes, stepping onto that rugged mountain path, like earthworms, lying under the thorns, like little snakes winding.</p>
<p>Unmindful of danger, forgetting the hardship, people who have stepped on the side of this mountain all have the expectation of reaching the peak. No one wants to stop halfway up the mountain, even if there are deep ravines, dangerous cliffs, and all kinds of dangerous roads!</p>
<p>The peak stands tall between the clouds, it is the bud of people's hope. Even if climbing is the most difficult thing in the world, but in order to have a majestic destination, nothing can diminish people's courage!</p>
<p>On the peak, you feel that the world is too small, the valleys at the foot of the mountain are too dark, and all the base, evil, ugly customs and behaviors and concepts of the world have flown out of your heart!</p>
<p>On the peak, there is only sublime and light!</p>
<h3>The Mission Completed From One's Own Position</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chun</p>
<p>Comparing the material conditions of military equipment: It was originally very arduous and difficult for China to fight against an aggressor who had been plotting for decades. However, since the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, China has been fiercely fighting with the aggressor in this difficult and arduous environment for twenty-one months. Not only has the main force of the resistance not been defeated, but the overall situation has also been getting better. This cannot but be said to be a proof that spirit overcomes matter, and it is also a proof of the greatness of the Chinese national spirit.</p>
<p>"A sheet of loose sand," this is a traditional insult to the Chinese nation by Westerners, and the aggressors are precisely under this estimate of "a sheet of loose sand" that they are exerting their aggressive ambitions, fully expecting to swallow up this old and large China in a short period of "three months" or "half a year." Unexpectedly, under the influence of revolutionary doctrine, our Chinese nation has long been forged from "a sheet of loose sand" into a golden city of copper walls and iron walls. In the current environment, everyone knows that to obtain international freedom and equality and complete the mission of the revolution, it is necessary to break free from hardship and difficulty. Therefore, although the material conditions are simple, our spirit of struggle is becoming more and more vigorous! Before the aggressor's ambition has been abandoned, the Chinese people will never kneel before the artillery fire!</p>
<p>The fact is that the greatness of spiritual power has already consumed a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the aggressor in the past twenty-one months, and has made it fall into a dilemma of advancing and retreating. Logically, everyone should firmly believe in the certainty of final victory, but a few people with fear of Japan, such as Wang Jingwei and his ilk, still disregard the greatness of spiritual power, and do not hesitate to sell their souls and personalities in a humble manner, repeatedly publishing his fallacious theories of advocating peace. This is truly extremely insane. This time, the central government is promoting a general mobilization of the spirit. On the one hand, it really wants our compatriots across the country to reflect on themselves: are all words, actions, and life serious and in accordance with the provisions of the twelve national covenants? At the same time, on the other hand, it wants every Chinese compatriot to shoulder the mission of saving the country, first thoroughly eliminate the pseudo-resisters in our own ranks, and then unify our steps and launch a general counter-offensive against the aggressor. Therefore, in his speech on the 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarded the implementation of this national spiritual mobilization as "the most important event related to the survival of the country, the vitality of the nation, and the success or failure of the war of resistance."</p>
<p>However, after we have implemented the general mobilization of the spirit, and our compatriots across the country have launched a counter-offensive posture, the traitors and aggressors will inevitably show the dying throes of their panic. Under this circumstance, we should firmly believe, not be tempted by profit, and not be afraid of threats to not give up our mission. And we cultural people, especially, should be persevering and unyielding, and under the spirit of not fearing death, not fearing hardship, and not fearing difficulty, we should do our best to verbally criticize and write articles against the aggressors and traitors, completing the mission of our position.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been the center of culture. Although under the siege of evil forces, there are a few dregs in the cultural circle who are doing the treasonous deeds of recognizing thieves as fathers, but the arduous struggle of the majority of cultural people is also an undeniable fact. The traditional spirit of scholars who "would rather have their heads cut off than surrender their will" is still gloriously maintained. However, we cannot consider ourselves satisfied and relax our responsibility, but should work harder to complete the glorious mission on our position.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Prohibition of Hanging National Flags</h3>
<p>— A Citizen</p>
<p>Regarding the misunderstanding caused by the French Concession authorities prohibiting the hanging of national flags on the propaganda day for the industrial and commercial circles during the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week the other day, it is indeed an "unfortunate incident." Because in the process of our China's war of resistance, in addition to the biggest enemy and its allies (such as Germany and Italy), Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries are our most friendly friends. And peaceful and democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, whether their governments or their people, have given us more or less help in spirit and material. Therefore, we can only regard the prohibition of hanging national flags as an "unfortunate incident" caused by a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>In fact, further speaking, the Japanese imperialists' attack on China is not simply to destroy our China, but to further "unify" the world by him. This has been clearly revealed in Tanaka Giichi's "Memorial." Recently, Japan changed its "northward advance" to "southward advance" because it bumped into a gray nose in Zhanggufeng, Soviet Union. Hainan Island was already occupied first, and Xinnan Island was occupied later. These are very disrespectful acts towards France. With the gradual implementation of the "southward policy" and the transfer of the US fleet to the Pacific, from these concrete facts, our China's war of resistance is not only for the survival of our nation, but also for the protection of the interests of Britain and France? "China is fighting for Britain," this cry from a British government member still echoes in everyone's ears today. Therefore, our China's war of resistance does not hinder the interests of other friendly countries. On the contrary, only Japan's occupation of China hinders the interests of major democratic countries in the Far East.</p>
<p>Now, in various occupied areas, an anti-British movement is swelling, and all puppet newspapers are emphasizing the idea of "anti-white people." The so-called "anti-British movement" actually includes movements against democratic countries such as France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen how great Japan's ambition is. Therefore, democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States should not only sympathize with our war of resistance in spirit, but also need to assist our war of resistance materially. It is even more inappropriate to prohibit our flag-hanging to express the general mobilization of our national spirit, and should be sympathized with and helped.</p>
<p>However, "unfortunate incidents" always occur due to "misunderstandings." On the one hand, we certainly express our admiration to the compatriots in the French Concession who are fighting for the freedom to hang the national flag. At the same time, we hope that this "unfortunate incident" should not be expanded. We must know that we currently have only one enemy. We should have sincere discussions with the French Concession authorities about the misunderstanding of prohibiting the hanging of national flags, so as to avoid the occurrence of the same "unfortunate incident" again. At the same time, we must not give the enemy and all traitors and Trotskyites an opportunity to use them. The traitors will say, "Look at the white people!" A Trotskyite will say, "Down with all imperialisms." We must not be fooled, so as not to divert our attention. We hope that our compatriots will pay attention to it, and we also hope that the authorities in the French Concession will pay attention to it. Saying that prohibiting the hanging of national flags is to avoid "accidents," then the result will be exactly the opposite, and it will instead produce "accidents."</p>
<h3>Black Umbrella Bandit</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>"Black Umbrella Bandit" (Ambush) is like an ordinary detective film. It writes about a bandit robbing a bank, and finally solving the case and capturing the bandit leader. The reason why it is called "Black Umbrella Bandit" is because the bandit leader's umbrella never leaves his hand and is used as a weapon.</p>
<p>If it is viewed as a detective film, it is too monotonous. Although it also has thrilling scenes such as using smoke screens, grabbing huge sums of money, car chases, plane escapes, and finally capturing the bandit leader, we have seen too many of these scenes. Moreover, the director is only narrating the story plainly, and it undoubtedly does not arouse the audience's interest.</p>
<p>What can be barely mentioned is that the younger brother Charlie, who is naturally lewd and likes to associate with bandits, is finally moved by his sister Jenny, who works as a female clerk in the Pacific Bank, which makes him feel ashamed and fight with the bandits in the plane, resulting in his death. Of course, we can still remember Father Flanagan's words in "Boys Town": "There is no bad boy in the world." Then, this is just the tail of reformism.</p>
<p>Lloyd Nolan, who plays the car driver Tony here, and Dorothy Lamour's "The Hurricane" were not proper. In this film, he returns to his old profession and can have a little more opportunity to act.</p>
<p>I can't remember what "Black Umbrella Bandit" actor Ernest Truex has acted in before. Here, he seems to fit the role and has the alert and calm attitude of a bandit.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Kentucky"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Richard Greene, the third generation of Robert Taylor (the second generation should be Tyrone Power), and Loretta Young have cooperated in "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell" before, and now they have cooperated in this color film "Kentucky". This makes people think of Loretta Young and Tyrone Power's cooperation in "Suez," and can't help but feel that "talented people come forth from generation to generation," and youth is easy to grow old, which seems even more obvious in Hollywood. Although Tyrone Power is still the "big lover" of movie fans such as wives and young ladies, the honor of starring in three blockbusters in a year ("In Old Chicago," "Alexander's Ragtime Band," "Suez") may be passed on to Richard Greene or his next generation.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hollywood's recent competition in shooting color films also illustrates its "ever-changing" nature. The tendency of color films to replace black-and-white films is certainly due to the inevitable progress of silent films like talking films, but what stimulates its progress is the invention of wireless image transmission. According to rumors, stereoscopic films have also been invented by a photographer, and Sondra Druin is already shooting them. Hollywood's (ever-changing) tricks are constantly innovating, and the rapid changes also illustrate that the transition of Hollywood's "dashing young men" from Robert Taylor to Richard Greene's third generation in a few years is not without reason.</p>
<p>Speaking of the film "Kentucky," we can easily think of "Romeo and Juliet." Of course, in terms of literary value, they are far apart, but the point of love eliminating family feuds is the same. The story of "Kentucky" tells about the feud between the Dillon and Goodwin families due to different political views during the American Civil War in 1861, which has not been eliminated even after it was passed down to their descendants. Finally, the feud was resolved because Jack Dillon and Sally Goodwin fell in love. The film uses a lot of breeding horses and horse racing. The spring suburban horse trials are very beautiful in the color film. The fate of "Kentucky" being shot as a five-color film is probably determined by these horses.</p>
<p>What kind of impressions and feelings do we have after watching "Kentucky"? Maybe I think too far and too absurdly. I think of our KMT-CPC cooperation. Because Jack Dillon's training of the Goodwin family's "Blue Grass" (horse name) was victorious, this illustrates the benefits of cooperation, a result of a spirit of cooperation. This makes people think of the mission and inevitable victory of KMT-CPC cooperation in this holy war. Of course, some people may say that this is too absurd, but as an important explanation of the cooperation of discarding prejudices and old feuds, this "Kentucky" has a trigger for people to think of this point.</p>
<p>The director is not very strong. From the perspective of "art for art's sake," the handling of the scene in which John Dillon shoots Thad Goodwin is not bad. From Thad's being shot to the young Peter Goodwin chasing John Dillon's horse while crying and scolding, the atmosphere is very tight. Bob Watson, who plays the young Peter Goodwin, also performs very well; but looking at the whole play, I don't like this kind of handling. He plants the seeds of hatred too deeply, making the subsequent resolution of the feud become Jack and Sally's youthful ignorance. Of course, this top-heavy problem is due to the lack of power to handle the following scenes well, but the audience's impression is always like this.</p>
<p>Loretta Young performed well. I like Richard Greene in the few scenes when he appears. He has a bit of youthful vitality. Later, that kind of "dashing young man" look reminds me of the foreign prodigals I often see in Shanghai dance halls, and I don't like it. Bob Watson, who plays the young Peter, and Walter Pidgeon, who plays the old Peter, are very good.</p>
<h3>Life Report - No Reading in Bookstores Allowed</h3>
<p>— (By)</p>
<p>I have been a trainee in a bookstore for more than three years, and my monthly salary is still only three yuan. Every day, I have to deal with retail sales during the day, and sort and distribute books at night. I can't rest until after eleven o'clock. I don't have any free time for my studies, so I want to take advantage of the slightly empty opportunity during the day to read a few useful books, but unexpectedly, I was scolded and reprimanded by the manager. Yesterday, I was fired by the manager for reading books and was on the road to unemployment.</p>
<p>The reason is this, according to a colleague, "The manager is calling us to do business, reading is something that should be done in school. Moreover, if you read books, what does it look like to people? There are no rules for merchants!"</p>
<p>He continued to tell me: "You can't even borrow books - the books in the retail department - to read at night, because the manager will wrong you for stealing them when he sees them."</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of wrongdoing does exist. A few days ago, a colleague was fired in a similar situation. He was committing almost the same problem as me. Because he could not get permission from the environment, he sometimes had to do "irregular" things.</p>
<p>The so-called "irregular" thing is that when he closes the store at night, he always stealthily takes two or three publications to his bedroom to read, and the next morning, he stealthily puts them back. This originally did not cause them any harm, but if the manager or his appointed spy saw it, he would ask you to get lost!</p>
<p>After this happened, I had a small question, that is, when he was fired, the other trainees didn't find it strange; but the person who was fired told us when he left: "Friends! Sooner or later, you will also be fired." After that, this matter revolved in my mind every day, wondering: Did he commit other illegal things?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I really committed the same "mistake". I was summoned by the manager for a conversation, and as a result, I received the order to get lost. So I simply became bolder and argued with him, and what I got was the reason that "reading books is not allowed in bookstores."</p>
<p>Through years of practice, I have come to understand that bookstores are also a kind of despicable store. They falsely bear the beautiful name of promoting culture, but in reality, they engage in the dirty business of selling their souls. (Of course, good bookstores are an exception.) If erotic books sell well, they sell erotic books. If there are subsidies, they publish publications that are beneficial to the public. No one can see through the boss's conspiracy.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality? Acting on the Spot, It is Appropriate to Go or Stop, and Make a Home Everywhere</p>
<p>Wu Junsu, however, rented a house alone. Although she is from Suzhou, her large family lives in Shanghai. The house she is in now is shared by her and her sister. Because she has a younger sister named Wu Junke, who is still studying at Soochow University, the two sisters can just rent a house together. Wu Junsu likes excitement, and also loves friends. She immediately fell in love with the two Miss He and was especially compatible. Therefore, she specially invited them to her house to sweep the couch and wait. When Zhu Airen and others' cars arrived in front of her door, she was already at home, waiting for them for a long time. She was not only waiting for the three of them, but she was also waiting for Jin Danyu, who came from Shanghai. Zhu Airen and others arrived at her house and also saw her sister Wu Junke. This younger sister is five years younger than Junsu. She is a high-achieving student in the science and physics department of Soochow University and will graduate next year. Her face shape is also similar to Wu Junsu, but she is taller than her sister and is a healthy and beautiful youth. She is very outstanding in the women's ball games at school. Zhu Airen had already met this younger sister, but the two Miss He were meeting her for the first time. Although their house is not big, it is very delicately decorated. The downstairs room is a reception room, with sofas and chairs, and also Junsu's piano. This is her hobby and she is also a master. Like her younger sister Junke, although she knows a little bit, she is not as good as her sister. Among these ladies today, only He Shuangyu and Wu Junsu have the same hobby, and they can be considered soulmates. Because Shuangyu had also studied in the United States, but Shuangyu can't be considered a piano expert. The second floor is the room for the two sisters. Recently, because of entertaining guests, they vacated the second floor and moved to a pavilion to live in. The third floor was originally their study and their library. They do not hire maids, and all the affairs in the house are done by themselves. There is a public dining room for eating, so you don't have to eat at home, which saves a lot of trouble. If there are miscellaneous errands and other things, there are also people who provide public service. Zhu Airen and others had not been here for half an hour when they heard laughter and clamor outside the door. It was Jin Danyu who had arrived. Jin Danyu had been to Wu Junsu's house before, so she was relatively familiar. She also knew many people at school, and there were also old classmates inside. Danyu also came by train today. Although there are various means of transportation between Suzhou and Shanghai now, the train is still the most convenient. When she arrived at the train station, she hired a car to come. (91)</p>

<h3>Hollywood Movie Stars' Criteria for Choosing a Spouse</h3>
<p>— Chun Xu</p>
<p>A French reporter specifically went to Hollywood to ask local male and female stars about the conditions for choosing a spouse (Note: This refers only to appearance, body, and character. Other conditions such as property, occupation, and education are not discussed).</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the male stars:</p>
<p>(1) They love women with golden chestnut hair, because most of these women are probably beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) They worship thin women (of course, not referring to women who are skin and bones and too weak). Women full of curves and the typical female athlete are not their ideal partners. There is a popular saying in Hollywood: "The curve is not the shortest path from one point to another, so this is not an interesting line." This sentence fully expresses the degree to which they hate muscular fullness.</p>
<p>(3) They love happy, cheerful, lively women with a slightly silly nature. Because marrying this kind of woman can make the husband easily comforted in daily life and forget the hard work. On the contrary, if you marry a woman who is sad all day long, it is no different from placing a machine that creates troubles and tragedies at home.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the female stars on choosing a husband:</p>
<p>(1) They love to marry men with brown hair, because most men in the United States have brown hair. Men with black and dark hair are not popular with them, because too dark hair makes the face look unkind.</p>
<p>(2) They love tall, lean men with long legs.</p>
<p>(3) They love men with a natural attitude, not restrained, good at telling jokes, and with a heroic spirit. Silent, British gentleman-style men are what they consider the most boring things.</p>

<h3>Tidbits from the Broadcasting Circle (3)</h3>
<p>— Bi Hua</p>
<p>(Continued from March 31. The author has been ill for many days, which has delayed the continuation of the manuscript. Please forgive the readers.)</p>
<p>Sha Buqi once ran a small newspaper a few years ago. His eloquence was indeed well-known in the tabloid world. He was a very strong debater and spoke eloquently. It is appropriate for him to run to the radio station to broadcast dramas and be welcomed. Unfortunately, he did not know how to advertise himself in the air. The purpose was to tell fortunes and predict destinies for people. He gave consideration to one thing and lost sight of the other. It is inevitable that he would be distracted from his inherent business - drama - and be affected by it.</p>
<p>Chen Pingqian is a drama practitioner. Of course, he has considerable experience. He is an old hand at shaping wheels and is indeed extraordinary. During the heyday of drama, he was also a strong general under the leadership of the late drama tycoon Zheng Zhengqiu. Recently, he has also been living a broadcasting life. Because he has a foundation in learning, it is not easy for him to be able to mix in the broadcasting circle to this day.</p>
<p>Ji Fansan's background is singing drama. He has filmed movies. He has a large body and can make the voice of a little girl. He has not been defeated for a long time and is still standing still. He also occupies a considerable position in drama broadcasting.</p>
<p>Wang Yayu's drama can be called the most powerful and has the most programs on the radio station. It is a pity that the dramas he broadcasts are too old-fashioned. If he can change his purpose and find materials from the times and add hype, it will definitely add a lot of color.</p>
<p>Gu Xingping and Gu Yulian's father and daughter's drama has a long history and they are engaged in it seriously, which is quite popular with the audience. It would be best if they could come up with some new tricks.</p>
<p>Others, such as Xu Qingfeng, Shen Shuofeng, and Yuan Zhifei, are all outstanding talents who broadcast dramas on the radio. The author believes that the dramas on the radio are almost all the same, with little difference. If they can engage in rectification and reform the script, then the audience will definitely express sympathy. If this continues without seeking reform, the audience will get tired of it over time, and I am afraid it will be difficult to be welcomed.</p>
<h3>The Original Meaning of the Western Name for "Pygmalion" (賣花女)</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang (新良)</p>
<p>The humor master George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" (賣花女) has finally been released at the Cathay Theatre (國泰大戲院) in this city. From any perspective, we can know that this film will certainly attract general attention. The film's ingenious plot, light and pleasant dialogue, and the well-matched cast are all top-notch. Here, allow me to explain the original meaning of the Western name Pygmalion (Pygmalion) for "The Flower Girl," to contribute to the readers.</p>
<p>According to legend, Pygmalion was originally a prince of the island of Cyprus (located in the eastern Mediterranean) in ancient times. He carved an extremely beautiful and exquisitely detailed ivory statue of a woman. As time passed, the prince became enamored with this ivory statue, to the point that he was restless day and night, unable to sit or sleep peacefully. Helpless, he pleaded with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, to transform the ivory statue into a living "person." Seeing his ardent love, the goddess granted his wish. At that time, Pygmalion married this woman and successfully completed a happy marriage.</p>
<p>According to the above, the prince fell in love with the ivory statue, and the goddess of love transformed the ivory statue into a living person... etc. are probably all so-called "myths." In "Pygmalion," Higglins is the incarnation of Pygmalion, and the flower girl Eliza is the incarnation of this ivory statue. The only difference is that Higgins does not fall in love with Eliza, but only intends to become good friends with her.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Troupe Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Faisheng (吠聲)</p>
<p>I, the writer, was invited by Mr. Shen of the Shanghai Bank's Peking Opera Troupe to observe their second small rehearsal. I was delighted to witness it, and I will briefly record my impressions below: The rehearsal was scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM. I was delayed due to other matters, so when I arrived, Luo Cheng's Challenge (羅成呌關) was already coming to an end. Following that was The Fa Men Temple (法門寺). Originally, Mr. Zhu Zaichen (朱再岑) was to play Liu Jin (劉瑾), but because Mr. Zhu was suffering from a stomach ailment, he was unable to perform on stage. Mr. Yun Baocheng (惲葆丞) temporarily took his place. His acting was solid and experienced, his dialogue was clear and fluent, truly only someone with a deep understanding of the craft could achieve that. Miss Xu Zuixia's (徐醉霞) Song Qiaoji (宋巧妓) was also quite impressive. Most commendable and valuable was Mr. Qu Hongxiang's (區鴻翔) Zhao Lian (趙廉). In addition to his accurate pronunciation and vocal delivery, his expressions were also fully expressive. As a Cantonese person making his stage debut (Mr. Qu is from Guangdong), achieving such results was truly unexpected. If he continues to work hard on his acting, one can predict that he will join the ranks of famous amateur performers in the future. Next was Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao (打鼓駡曹). Mr. Wu Zhaonan (吳照南), playing Cao Cao (曹操), possessed both a tall and imposing figure and a loud and resonant voice. Mr. Sheng Zongcai (盛宗才), playing Mi Heng (彌衡), was gentle and refined, worthy of a scholar, and a sense of frustration was particularly evident in his eyebrows. The drum-beating scene was even more brilliant. Finally, there was Si Lang Visits His Mother (四郞探母). Mr. Du Tairan's (杜泰然) Yang Yanhui (楊延輝) had the best voice in the entire troupe. The long passage of Xipi (西皮) during the sitting in the palace scene (坐宮) was extremely gentle and tortuous. Ms. Zhou Sunxiu (周孫秀), playing the Princess (公主), had a dignified appearance and graceful demeanor. The long passage of Xipi she sang was also very pleasant to the ear. Miss Shen Xiaohu's (沈曉湖) Empress Xiao (蕭后) had a style reminiscent of Furong Cao (芙蓉草), so it's no wonder she won a full house of applause. Mr. Shen Muda's (沈慕達) Zong Bao (宗保) had an excellent appearance, accurate pronunciation, and his "yao qiang" (要腔) and stage poses were as skillful as someone with years of experience. It's a pity his voice was weak. Mr. Zou Binji's (鄒賓吉) Sixth Brother (六郞) was accurate in every aspect. Unfortunately, the drummer made a mistake on the drum points temporarily, which led to him forgetting his lines when he personally went down to untie Si Lang's shackles. This was probably due to being nervous on his first stage performance, focusing on one thing and losing sight of others. It was a minor flaw. Mr. Shi Bingyong's (石秉庸) Dowager (太君) had a lot of expression on his face, adding a lot of color to the whole play. Mr. Zhou Sizhong (周思忠), playing the young barbarian (小番), drew a black mustache all over his face to prevent the small mustache from being seen by the audience, causing the audience to laugh, which was also amusing. Most admirable was the spirit of cooperation within the troupe. For example, the president, Mr. You Boqun (游伯羣), and Mr. Pu Enluo (濮恩犖), played officials in this play. The stage manager, Mr. Chen Baode (陳寳德), after starring in The South Heaven Gate (南天門), played extras in several plays. They shared the spirit of unity and cooperation regardless of class. Therefore, I am happy to record it as above. I heard that the troupe also plans to hold a public performance to raise money for disaster relief, which is to combine entertainment with charity, which is truly commendable.</p>

<h3>After Viewing the Exhibition of Chinese Paintings and Calligraphy Through the Ages (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Dieye (陳蝶野)</p>
<p>Liu Haisu (劉海粟) calls himself an art rebel. After forty, he frantically collected Chinese paintings. His innate brushstrokes are close to Shi Tao (石濤) and Bada Shanren (八大), but the scroll of Ni Yuanlu (倪元璐) listed at the exhibition is the best. Haisu once obtained Huang Shimmo's Pine Scroll (黃石磨松卷), which would have been a perfect match for this. Why wasn't it displayed together? Shi Tao's large-scale painting seems to have been repainted. It remains the same as before. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Xu Bangda's (徐邦達) collection is as exquisite as Cong Yu's (蔥玉), but Cong Yu is a collector, while Bangda is a painter. Bangda is skilled in painting, so his collection is different from Cong Yu's. If the Winter Green Pavilion Map (冬靑館圖) by Wang Meng (王蒙), the Nine Songs (九歌) by Zhang Wo (張渥), and the Landscape Scroll (山水卷) by Dong Qichang (董玄宰) all demonstrate his eye and skills, which is different from someone with a broad and unfocused love. The Cotton (木棉) painting by Sun Ai (孫艾) is purely a sketch of flowers, elegant and unique, which is different from the Shi Tao Huang Mudan (黃牡丹) which seems mundane in comparison.</p>
<p>The Nine Peaks Snowy Mist Map (九峯雪霧圖) collected by Huang Huanglou (黃黃樓) has been recorded since the Ming and Qing dynasties. Dong Qichang (董　臣), Hu Yunxiang (虎惲香山) all seemed to have originated from this. Now looking at the original, Zhu De (朱得) can be considered Zhao Mengfu's (趙孟頫) best work. However, Zhao Mengfu's painting has already returned to heaven. The existence of a corner in the world is like a unicorn or phoenix, let alone a complete six-foot piece? Huanglou does not cherish elite works and shares it with the public. His merits can be said to be immeasurable. Compared to those who hide treasures in their homes and never go out, can they be mentioned in the same breath? The calligraphy of Wen Zhengming (文徵明), Xu Wei (徐渭), Hai Rui (海瑞), Li Tengfang (李騰芳), Huang Daozhou (黃道周) and other scholars are all from Huanglou, which particularly wins my heart. Cheng Mengyang's (程孟陽) Autumn Forest Walking with a Staff (秋林策杖圖) can also be considered the wine sacrifice in the association of nine friends (九友祭酒). If a piece by Ma Yuan (馬遠), then it's all from the Ming people.</p>
<p>Fang Congyi's (方從義) Stream Bridge Seclusion (溪橋幽興) collected by Pan Boshan (潘博山) and Guo Bi's (郭畀) Imitating Gao Mi Cloud Mountain (仿高米雲山) collected by Lin Erqing (林爾卿) are both unparalleled works of the Yuan Dynasty. Fang is ancient and elegant, even better than Guo's scroll. I watched it for half an hour and couldn't leave. Boshan has many legal books in his collection, but few were exhibited in this meeting, which makes people feel tired.</p>
<p>Wang Jiquan's (王季銓) Wang Meng's (王蒙) Secluded Residence in the Forest (林麓幽居) is slightly less spiritual than Bangda's Winter Green Pavilion Map, but it is also rare. Chen Hongshou's (陳洪綬) Mountain Bird Plum Blossom (山鳥梅花) is clumsy and ancient. Jiquan has a rich collection, but he exhibited very little, which made me feel the same as Boshan.</p>
<p>Diechao's (蝶巢) Ni Yunlin's (倪雲林) Green Water Map (綠水圖), Zhou Yuqing's (周雨靑) Wu Xiaozhen's (吳小　　) Evening View of the Lake (湖晚眺), Zhu Qizhan's (朱屺瞻) Sun Kehong's (孫克弘) Mountain Temple Misty Mist (山寺烟霧), Xu Junqing's (徐俊卿) Xiang Shengmo's (項聖謨) Snowy Landscape (雪景山水), Sun Bangrui's (孫邦瑞) Wang Shigu's (王石谷) Cold Pond (寒塘　　) are all fine works. I have three regrets about this meeting. One is that there are no representative works of Wen Zhengming (文), Shen Zhou (沈), Tang Yin (唐), and Qiu Ying (仇). The second is that the Four Wangs (四王), Wu Li (吳), and Yun Shouping (惲) were not satisfied with what was on display. The third is that there are too many mediocre works by Zhu Da (朱盡), and I can't bear to part with them after Qianlong and Jiaqing (乾嘉以後). There is one hope. In the past, many collectors were unwilling to publicly display their exquisite collections. It wasn't because they were stingy, but because the displayers were often careless and didn't know how to cherish them. Once displayed, the table surface was often contaminated. If you want to re-mount it heavily, the spirit of repeated mounting will be exhausted. If you leave it in a mess, your heart will be unhappy, so you often fill the capital with medium-quality products. However, this exhibition was mostly meticulously managed by Bangda. Not only was it displayed and dusted, but it was also cherished very much. In the era of human generations, it was able to be arranged in an orderly manner. If there is no question in your chest, how can you get to this point? Collectors can be happy about this. It can be predicted that later works will compete to display their collections and satisfy the eyes of people.</p>

<h3>Finance: Cash Tianjin Gang Longs Unwind</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot silver (烚赤) and unofficial market conditions saw a slight increase in the range of fluctuations. The situation was slightly higher first and then lower. Initially, the price went up to 2,077 yuan due to a certain silver shop buying on behalf of customers. Then, because the securities firms, on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, sold all the long positions they had taken on Saturday last week, and a certain silver firm also followed suit, and because the buyers were not strong enough, the market weakened suddenly. By noon, the price even fell below the 70 yuan level, retreating to 2,069 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the momentum stabilized slightly. It was heard that the buyers were willing to absorb at 70 yuan, but the sellers' intention to sell weakened, saying that they would only be willing to sell if it was 71 or 72 yuan. As a result, it fell 6 yuan compared with the closing price at noon on the previous day. The morning trading was still strong, about 700 taels. There was no trading in the afternoon. Silver jewelry also fell by 1 yuan. Customs gold remained flat. British pure gold, etc., rose again.</p>
<p>Spot Silver Market Falls 6 Yuan</p>

At 9:40, a certain silver shop was seen buying 100 taels from a certain money exchange shop on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, with the opening price of 2,077 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. After the opening, the securities firms also sold a large amount on behalf of the Tianjin Gang, and the potential trend suddenly turned downward. The securities firms sold 50 taels to the silver shop firms at the same price as the morning opening. Then, it sold another 50 taels to a certain silver firm at the price of 75 yuan. Later, it sold another 50 taels to a certain silver shop at the price of 74 yuan. At that time, there were fewer and fewer buyers, so the downward trend intensified. The securities firms then sold 50 taels to the silver shop firms at the price of 71 yuan. Later, a certain silver firm sold 130 taels to a certain silver shop on behalf of customers at the price of 70 yuan. Immediately, a certain silver firm bought 50 taels from the silver shop at the original price. After that, the securities firms sold another 50 taels to a certain money house at the price of 70 yuan. At the same price, Jin Hao also sold 50 taels to the money exchange shop. Near noon, the silver shop firms sold 50 taels to the money exchange shop at 69 yuan, which was the closing price at noon. The market was quiet in the afternoon. Supply and demand were both scarce. Later, a certain money exchange shop suddenly wanted to buy, bidding 70 yuan, but the sellers were all waiting and watching. Until after 4 o'clock, they still did not find an opponent, resulting in no trading. If calculated according to the noon closing price of 2,069 yuan, the result was a drop of 6 yuan compared with the closing price last night. The difference was 8 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry is Listed Down 1 Yuan</p>

<h3>Forward US Dollar: Trading Continues to Flourish, European Crisis Lurks, Bank of Japan Unwinds Fiercely in Secret</h3>
<p>Although major foreign firms frequently came to unwind in the foreign exchange market yesterday, the situation became more stable due to the competition between British and American banks to supply, and the money exchange firms also came to sell US dollars. As a result, it remained flat, and trading was quite active. The trading of US dollar futures was also quite lively. Recently, the European situation has eased slightly, but the crisis still lurks. Therefore, the Bank of Japan unwinds fiercely in secret. Fortunately, foreign firms still have no interest in supplying because the difference between the spot price and the three-month swap for July is only 1.25 US dollars.

The HSBC listing was announced unchanged, and the silver balance announcement also had no rise or fall, still charging 5.25%. After that, foreign firms purchased and settled with HSBC and Maccary British pounds at 8 pence and 25. Then, foreign firms, with good profits, unwound forward US dollars on behalf of the Bank of Japan. However, because the banks' intention to sell was still good, the potential trend was quite stable.

The noon trading was relatively quiet. There was a slight trading of Hong Kong dollars. The Chinese banks traded Hong Kong dollars mutually at 56 yuan, which was also flat.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Have Grown into a Lively Long and Weak Short Situation. United Shanghai Reached 63 Yuan Yesterday. London Foreign Debt Fell More Than It Rose.</h3>
<p>The securities market was still hovering yesterday, but the rising trend was actually stable. Type A once rose to a recent high of 63 yuan. Types C, D, and E also broke through 53 yuan, and the situation was very firm. The foundation was stable. The trend should be more stable in the future. The shorts have been stimulated repeatedly and have shown signs of being unstable. However, there are still many people who short when the price is high. Most of the over-the-counter cap trading involved snatching long positions. This also reflects the hearts of some people. Long long and short short is a common slogan. The environment is good, and people's hearts are excellent. Now Type A is close to the high price on January 10. Reviewing yesterday, Defu and Tongshun were the most eager to buy in the morning opening. Types C, D, and E broke through 53 yuan in an instant. Type A also saw 63 yuan. Dafeng, Yuji, Yongkang, and Datong all had a good appetite or covered shorts. Although Xingyuan, Chengkang, and Changhe were the sellers, the demand was still greater than the supply. Later, Tiansheng, Lemao, and No. 41 and others bravely sold, and the market price was suppressed. Most of the others were uneasy and sold with the crowd, but the result was still a rise of 2 or 3 jiao. The news was suddenly better in the afternoon. Xie Da took the lead in enthusiastically buying, and Defu, Xinfeng, and Yong also had a large demand. Retail investors started to cover shorts again, and the market price rose again. Although there were sellers, they no longer attracted attention. Most of those who followed the trend were struggling, so they returned to a high of several jiao in the afternoon. The trend was excellent. After the closing, it was even said that the recapture of Guangzhou was near, people's hearts were more firm, and the market price continued to improve by 5 to 8 jiao compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was about 200 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>

Yihe shares saw a large number of buyers again, with a bid of 20 yuan. Ruirong's common shares were weak first and then strong, rising from 6 yuan and 6 jiao to 6 yuan and 8 jiao. The price of rubber raw materials in the rubber shares rose, resulting in more buyers, but the bid was low, so there were not many transactions. The bond market was dim, and the 8% bonds of China Business Company were traded at 55 taels. It was heard that the company would be reorganized immediately. How to calculate the setting, the trusting ones were all looking forward to it.</p>

The Longhai Railway bonds had printed bonds, which rose slightly by 5 shillings, and the price was 17 pounds and 15 shillings. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes and Raw Soybean Oil: Buying Interest Revived, Market Prices Saw New Records Again</h3>
<p>The raw soybean oil market conditions are difficult to fall because all sales venues are supplied from one place in this city. Therefore, the industry buys when the price is low. The Japanese firms recognize the goal, implement manipulation, and are quite able to respond to needs. Yesterday morning, inheriting the aftermath of the previous day, it was still soft, but in an instant, the buying interest was overflowing, and the supply was not meeting the demand. The market was frequently increased, and new records were seen again. The unified market included 80 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil at a price of 39 to 39 yuan and 5 jiao. More than 300 barrels of Dalian current barrel soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 40 yuan and 3 jiao and a half to 45 yuan. 50 barrels of white oil were opened at prices of 49 yuan and 48 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. 50 large bamboo baskets of Lianqi (42 yuan and 8 jiao), 160 pieces of Yanqi were traded at 33 yuan and 5 jiao to 34 yuan, and 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 32 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Speculation is Crazy, the Number of Transactions Has Increased Sharply, and the Market Has Risen Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian soybean cakes rebounded and rose because speculation was frenzied, and the number of transactions increased sharply. The futures and spot market prices rose consistently. The current cake rose by 5 fen compared to the market on the previous day. 5,000 pieces were opened at a price that rose from 2 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen to 8 jiao and 5 fen. The May futures rose by 1 jiao and 4 fen, and 20,000 pieces were traded at a price of 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 8 and a half fen to 3 yuan. More than 20,000 pieces were opened for June delivery at a price that rose from 2 yuan, 9 jiao, and 7 and a half fen to 3 yuan and 1 jiao, which was 1 jiao and 3 fen higher than the previous market. However, at the closing, the selling interest was strong. It was heard that no one asked about 3 yuan and 8 fen.</p>
<p>380 packages of soybeans were transported to Shantou on the 21st, and 610 packages were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: The Yarn Market Resembles a Tug-of-War, Brisk Sales Turn Sluggish, with Many Short Sellers Covering, and Large Dealers Maintaining Support by Absorbing Warehouse Receipts.</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially weakened then rebounded, resulting in uneven prices. This was because actual demand was weaker than before. Although Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants were buying, their volume was shallow, not as robust as in previous days. Shantou purchases had stopped, so some short sellers were selling off their positions in the market, causing the market to weaken. However, many parties believed that the supply of spot goods was not particularly loose, and their attitude remained bullish. As a result, the market resembled a tug-of-war. Later, some colleagues intervened, buying several hundred bales of warehouse receipts, which boosted market sentiment.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened weak in the morning. Trading was slow to start until 10:00 AM. In reality, customer sales were not strong, and acceptance from various parties was not smooth. Furthermore, those who had been allocated spot goods tickets were eager to sell, given the sluggish spot market. They immediately lowered their prices by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 401 yuan. However, demand remained scattered and weak, and customer purchases were scarce. The market price gradually declined, with the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn breaking the 400 yuan barrier, closing at 399.5 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 393.5 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn not only did not decline but instead advanced. 32-count and 42-count yarns also remained stable. In the afternoon, some colleagues, attracted by the cheap warehouse receipt prices, suddenly came to buy, taking in about 200 to 300 bales, causing immediate tension in the market. Prices immediately jumped by two yuan, to 395.5 to 396 yuan. Spot prices followed suit, with the closing price at 402 yuan. As a result, the price of 20-count "Female" yarn fell by one yuan, the price of Double Horse yarn remained unchanged, and the price of Extra Grade All Yarn fell by 2.5 yuan. The price of 10-count coarse yarn rose by about two yuan. It was found that all parties bought a total of 1,140 bales throughout the day. The Yong'an Factory released 300 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng yarn at a price of 338 yuan, for delivery from June to August. Today, 410 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 80 bales to Yantai, 910 bales to Shantou, and 1,020 bales to Hong Kong. The transaction volume for each party is listed below:</p>
<h3>Good Transactions in Coarse Yarn, Constant Orders for Indian Cotton from Factories</h3>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton prices, New York cotton prices have risen sharply by more than 20 points in the past three days due to short covering in May. Distant months were therefore slightly pulled up. Yesterday, the situation was more moderate. Although May rebounded by 5 points, other months saw small declines of 3 to 5 points. There is still no definite news from Washington regarding future cotton industry policies. The US cotton export figures have not improved, and cloth sales are very sluggish. This is because everyone involved in the cotton industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 20 points. Converted to legal tender, US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 4 jiao, Indian cotton fell by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 1 yuan.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, various factories had small transactions, mainly in "Ping Guo Er" cotton, because coarse yarn transactions were more active and "Yao Hua" cotton could not be transported to Shanghai for sale. "Bai Luo Qu" cotton was second most popular, and "Peng Jia Pu" cotton transactions were rare. Yesterday, Hongzhang bought 300 bales of "Bai Luo Qu" cotton, Anda bought 500 bales of "Ping Guo Er" cotton, and Defeng bought 1,000 bales of "Ping Guo Er" cotton. There were no transactions from other factories. The converted factory delivery prices for yesterday's cotton market are recorded below:</p>
<p>The local cotton market situation was similar to the previous day, with little change in selling prices. Defeng Factory still had some buying interest, but the volume was very small. Other factories showed no sign of activity. Trading among colleagues was also sparse. Various sources of supply were subject to various restrictions, resulting in a sense of scarcity. However, about three or four boats of "He Xia Huo Ji Hua" cotton arrived, totaling about 700 to 800 bales (each bale weighing 120 jin). Due to the unstable situation in the Subei area, only 66 bales arrived. Today, 30 bales were exported to Shantou and 50 bales to Hong Kong. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Exports Become Prosperous Again, White Factory Opens with a High Bid of 1,800 Yuan</h3>
<p>Regarding foreign silk markets, New York and Lyon reported further increases yesterday. Japanese silk rose by 4 points at both 83.75 and 75 points. The exchange's near-term prices rose by 8.5 points, and distant prices rose by 0.5 points. Lyon's Japanese silk rose by 2 francs, and Shanghai silk rose by 1 to 1.5 francs. Only Yokohama silk prices saw weak spot sales at the original price and distant prices falling by 27 yuan. Judging from yesterday's silk market, where US prices rose and Japanese prices fell, the recent surge in silk prices seemed to have reached its maximum limit. The US market's unique firmness yesterday was likely due to speculative short covering.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, exports were prosperous again yesterday. Da Chang and Yihe both received large payments. The White Factory opened with a high bid of 1,790 to 1,800 yuan, with transaction volume reaching 300 to 400 dan, a phenomenon rarely seen amid repeated silk price surges. According to yesterday's selling prices, they have risen by 100 yuan compared to three days ago (Monday this week). Yokohama spot prices, on the other hand, have only risen by 65 yuan in these four days. Therefore, the Shanghai market can be described as having both high prices and high transaction volume, changing the old pattern of "missing opportunities" and marking a new era in silk market operations.</p>
<h3>Grains: Tianjin Impurities Abound, Local Flour Sales to the North Are Obstructed</h3>
<p>Flour: Spot flour transactions at local factories were very sluggish yesterday. Customer sales were reported to be quiet. Northern merchants found it unprofitable to transport flour because the Tianjin exchange rate had fallen sharply, and the local market was affected by an abundance of mixed foreign flour, which hindered the sales of Shanghai flour to the north. Southern merchants were still clearing their previous orders, making it difficult to develop new transactions. As a result, the market was dull and lifeless. Factories initially intended to lower prices for customers, but because customer sales were quiet and foreign flour prices were unwilling to fall, there was no need to compromise. As a result, the price of No. 2 flour remained at the original price of 4 yuan and 4.5 jiao. It was reported that some returned goods were discounted by 5 fen, but this was not considered a formal market price. Total market transactions, excluding retail sales in the local street, were about 7,000 bales. It was found that today's flour exports were 100,800 bales to Tianjin, 33,700 bales to Shantou, and 4,500 bales to Yantai.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: The foreign flour market gradually cooled yesterday. According to overseas telegrams, wheat prices have fallen slightly, but distant foreign flour prices remain unfavorable. Therefore, those holding goods insisted on their prices and were unwilling to compromise. However, the local market was saturated, and northern merchants, due to unfavorable exchange rates and the abundance of local foreign flour, showed little interest in Shanghai flour or foreign flour. As a result, the market was quiet on both the supply and demand sides, and buyers and sellers held their positions. The selling price of mid-range brands was still 4 yuan and 2 jiao to 1.5 jiao in cash, with only scattered transactions.</p>
<h3>Du Geng Customer Sales Are Clear, Hot Weather Makes Rice Susceptible to Change, High-Grade Rice Returns Down by One or Two Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of supply from He Xia did not arrive, and only 2,000+ bags of "Che Lun Bao Zi" arrived from the Su Tong region. The hot weather makes the rice quality susceptible to change, which caused the local market and hoarding households to be dull. City wide trades were few, most goods were not sold out. Market has declined with plenty of returned goods conflicting with each other. Ruo Hou Geng prices declined by 1 Jiao to beyond, while Bo Dao also declined a few points to 1 Jiao. Du Yang Jian &amp; Bu Jian were hard to establish a foothold, also decreased by 1 Jiao, there were few asking about Bian Yuan. The market therefore was void of trades.</p>
<p>Although customer shipments were lacking to reach docks recently, small retail tickets were continuously loaded by Che Lun, but the Shanghai warehouses had an abundant stock, customer transformation has long stagnated, walking/warehouse entry has become even lighter. The market then daily declined, and floating warehouses/scattered households plotted to sell. Yesterday, the secondary grade customer goods within the market immediately sharply decreased by 2 Jiao, high grade goods also slightly decreased by beyond 1 Jiao. Wuhu Geng were only opening at 12.7 Jiao, the secondary was around 12 Jiao, while Zhong Guan rice was only at 11.2/3 Jiao. City wide trade was still only beyond 1,000 bags, while Yang Rice inventory has been depleting, new fixed prices were unfavourable, the goods provider was decreasing the price but unwilling to become to lax over it.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sichuan Merchants Add to Orders for Colored Cloth, In Significant Quantities, East Piece Goods Transactions are Scarce</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Trends toward stability, sales from each market is weak, but still without interruption. Chongqing merchants add to their orders for coloured cloth/twill, quantity rather numerous, totaling 5-6,000 pieces. Shantou merchants add to orders of coloured twill/poplin/coloured cloth, 60+ boxes. Wenzhou merchants trade white goods/coarse cloth the most, trade of each brand 13/14/16 pounds for several hundred bales, while households along the street drag in Yihe's coarse cloth, light and heavy weight for an additional 400+ bales. Coarse cloth sale disks continue to be firm, compared to the other day, each piece rose by 5 Fen. Fine cloth/Fine Twill, because each Chinese factory inherited/wove raw cloth, production quantities were all reduced, market inventory was thin, trade although sparse, market plate was steady. Yesterday, Jiangsu north, and dye factories purchased 100+ bales, Guangdong merchants traded fine cloth 30 bales, households choose Shen Xin Xin Yu &amp; Yong An 3 textile factory produced fine cloth/fine twill and continuously searched for purchase, traded 100+ bales, the sale disk for the 3 factories was especially good, each piece continually increased 5 Fen to 1 Jiao, bleached &amp; dyed cloth, sale disk was stable.</p>

<p>Wan Li Ding Er Ba has been sequentially placed on the market, because the sales are timely, the general west clothing tailors along the street, all have purchased, Yuan Chang brown grey &amp; pure white beige, sale is broad, especially those with hidden green &amp; light grey colours, demand is even greater, standard market price, the west goods cost is extensively high, trends will also, compared to last year, be extremely high. Yesterday, Meichen's lotus princess traded for 8 Yuan clear disk, Hao Shi brand 7 Yuan 1 Jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Rises by Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, coarse white was slightly tight. The association's planned price for 24-count stock at the local warehouse was 26 yuan and 3.5 jiao, with 50 bags traded. Transshipment goods were 18 yuan and 2 jiao to 1.5 jiao, with over 400 bags traded. Taikoo Che Bai called for a 5 fen increase, with spot goods at the Western warehouse at 26 yuan and 2 jiao. Domestic sugar only opened with a high price of 15 yuan and 3 jiao for Huanggangqing, and 15 yuan and 1 to 2 jiao for ordinary Mianchi, with a total of several hundred bags traded. On the 20th, 200 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou. (It was mistakenly published on the previous day that the opening price for Pianqing was 11 yuan. This is corrected here.)</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Bai He Pian, Smooth Sales to Shantou and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Bai He Pian (Lily Bulb Slices) were firm due to the continuous activity of Hong Kong merchants, and now sales to Shantou have become active again, causing prices to tighten further. It is found that stocks in the producing areas are limited, and the arrival of new goods is still far away. As on the previous day, a certain merchant wanted to buy but was willing to offer very little, raising the price by 2 yuan compared to the previous market. According to industry experts, those with slightly larger stockpiles seem to need to hold on to them.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Jian Tai Ships 6,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>In addition, 180 pieces of tobacco leaves, 8,000 pieces of native paper, 6,000 pieces of wood boards, 2,000 pieces of leather oil, and 4,000 pieces of native paper were imported on the 20th from Fuzhou.</p>
<p>On the 21st, 100 pieces of egg yolk whites were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Lead Skin Piece Price Inverted</h3>
<p>Metal transactions have been quite quiet recently. Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other merchants have been unable to purchase due to the rising exchange rate, so most Zhuang customers are taking a wait-and-see approach. As a result, export business has decreased sharply. Local manufacturers and merchants from Fujian and Zhejiang have also seen fewer transactions recently, and the market has gradually become flat. Fortunately, market prices in various cities have been able to hold steady. However, there are still overseas orders being placed, such as tinplate at 11 gold yuan, pig iron at 7 gold yuan and 6 jiao, white lead wire at 47 gold yuan and 5 jiao, secondary white lead wire at 36 gold yuan and 5 jiao, new iron products at 8 gold pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence per ton, white lead skin at 22 gold pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence per ton, thin black iron billets at 50 gold yuan, and general black iron billets at 43 gold yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, telegrams have been received for various iron products, but there are few changes from previous quotations. Regarding the above prices, except for white lead skin, which is inverted by more than 10 yuan per barrel in the Shanghai market, other goods still have a slight profit margin compared to the current market. Therefore, orders for various metal products have been placed in quantities ranging from 50-60 tons to 200-300 tons. However, only 50 barrels of white lead skin have been ordered. The most active metal shops placing orders are those along North Suzhou Road, followed by those along Beijing Road and Xin Kai He, and then the small hardware merchants.</p>

<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine and Diet Therapy</p>
<h3>The Favorable and Unfavorable Progression of Measles Cough and Its Relationship to Nursing and Diet Therapy</h3>
<p>— Yu Xuezhou</p>
<p>Recently, measles has been prevalent. Our publication has been well-received by readers since publishing articles on "Measles." Therefore, we are publishing several more articles by Mr. Yu to meet the expectations of readers. (Cun Ren's Knowledge)</p>
<p>Coughing is a necessary symptom of measles. If the cough is infrequent, occurring every few minutes with three or four coughs, is moist, and does not disrupt sleep, it will not affect health and will not change the course of the measles. The physiological function of coughing is to remove obstructions from the respiratory system, expelling them from the body with the force of the cough. Coughing in measles can also help the rash to erupt. Unless it is very severe, it is beneficial and harmless, and there is no need to administer cough suppressants to eliminate it. If the coughing is frequent and unproductive, or if the throat is sore and painful and the voice is hoarse due to excessive coughing, or if the stomach is shaken and vomiting occurs due to severe coughing, the situation may seem tense. However, if the eruption of the rash is not affected, and breathing is even without shortness of breath or rapid breathing, proper treatment can prevent major problems. If coughing is accompanied by rapid breathing and nasal flaring, or if coughing persists after the measles, these are unfavorable signs that require careful attention!</p>
<p>Colds can cause coughs, so those with measles should avoid wind and cold. However, excessive protection, such as tightly wrapping the sick child in heavy blankets or placing a stove in the room, can cause internal heat and coughing, which can also be very dangerous. Customarily, red dates are burned and placed in the sick child's room to "smoke" it, supposedly to speed up the eruption of the measles. However, dense smoke is most likely to irritate the airways and worsen the coughing. It is common to see people crowding into small rooms with already poor air quality, causing dizziness and nausea. If dense smoke is added, anyone with common sense can distinguish between harm and benefit. This method is especially unsuitable for children with severe coughs. Custom dictates that "no oil is used for frying" when cooking in a house with measles, in order to avoid the stimulation of oily fumes and prevent the coughing from worsening.</p>
<p>The occurrence of measles is often triggered by colds. An ancient prescription for erupting measles is to "decoct scallions in water, pour it into a basin, and fumigate the sick child over it." This method can also treat colds. By analogy, if someone with early-stage measles also has a cold and cough, boiling a few scallions, smashing them, and drinking the thin congee can relieve the cold and help the measles to erupt, achieving two benefits with one action. If the cough is caused by heat, it is often accompanied by a red complexion and rapid breathing, and the measles rash is dense and bright red. Cooling drinks such as sugarcane juice and pear juice are suitable. The degree of heat should be considered when determining whether to drink them cold or warm. Almonds, crushed with water to extract the juice, are also good. If the heat is severe, it can cause dryness and deplete fluids. Therefore, for a cough caused by dryness, with a dry cough and a glossy, red tongue, sweet and cooling sugarcane juice or pear juice is especially suitable. For a cough with a lot of phlegm, it is essential to eliminate phlegm. Radish can be juiced, and three to five drops of ginger juice can be added and taken warm. If the child with measles has loose stools, use caution. For a cough with a lot of phlegm, avoid eating greasy foods. Greasy foods should be avoided during the early stages of measles, and even in the later stages, when the rash has subsided and appetite has increased, greasy foods should still be avoided.</p>
<p>Whooping cough is a disease that children are very susceptible to. The cough has periods of remission, when the child is normal and shows no symptoms. However, when the cough starts, it is incessant, causing the face to turn red, veins to bulge, and forehead to sweat profusely, and it is difficult to cure. It often lasts for three or four months. Its period of prevalence coincides with measles, so it often occurs together, worsening the coughing and even leading to pneumonia, creating dangerous conditions. A simple prescription using Jian Lan leaves and Ci Xiao bamboo decoction has no proven effect. I often use Qing Yan Tan Wan to treat it. Children who take this medicine can have a clearer cough, and the duration of each cough can be reduced. The pill contains ephedra, which can also help erupt the measles. Even if there are already signs of pneumonia, it is beneficial and harmless to use it. Customarily, sweet and moist foods such as rock sugar and honey are often used for coughs, and are mixed with cough medicine. However, whooping cough requires promoting lung function, and sweet and moist substances are not suitable.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of measles cough is the symptom of "choking when drinking." There is no cough at all at ordinary times, but if milk, water, or medicine is given, coughing starts incessantly and then returns to silence. This phenomenon often occurs when measles turns into pneumonia. It is commonly said that measles should be accompanied by coughing, and that not coughing is an unfavorable sign. This is one example. In most cases, those with this symptom have a poor appetite and should not be forced to eat or drink. Treat the pneumonia to alleviate it, and then a sparse cough will occur. When there is no "choking when drinking" when fluids are given, the appetite will return, and then the issue of eating and drinking can be discussed. If the cough is severe and causes hoarseness, loquat blossom honey can be taken, one spoonful each time, twice a day. Or use one tael of almonds, soak them in hot water, remove the skin and tips, crush them with a cup of water to extract the juice, mix in half a tael of powdered raw aster, add a cup of honey, and decoct into a paste. Take half a spoonful each time, and take with thin congee.</p>
<p>A persistent cough can lead to consumption. After all symptoms of measles have subsided and the cough has gradually disappeared, if the cough persists, the limbs become thin, or there is tidal fever, it is a sign of measles consumption, which is not easy to treat. For diet therapy, use one pig lung, wash it thoroughly with clean water, add Ophiopogon japonicus, fritillary bulb, stemona root, aster, and Lycium chinense root bark and decoct and drink it.</p>
<h3>Garlic Kills Worms</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanqing</p>
<p>Garlic is pungent and warm in nature and has the function of treating diseases. It has the effect of removing phlegm, stopping coughs, stimulating the appetite, cleansing and diuresis and promoting sweating.</p>
<p>However, because it is pungent and hot, and has a strong odor, it should not be eaten in excess. Overeating can cause a stuffy feeling, as it can stimulate blood circulation and easily trigger hot flashes, especially in those with yin deficiency. Ancient people said that eating too much can cause blurred vision and impair the spirit, which is why.</p>
<p>It is often effective for cold and deficiency diseases in people with cold and phlegmatic constitutions. It is especially effective as a worm killer because its pungent odor penetrates and increases intestinal peristalsis. The worms are stimulated and cannot adhere to the intestines, so they are excreted with the stool. Finely chop the garlic, take it with water or milk, or boil it in milk, or add it to drinks and food to treat worm diseases that are ineffective with other medicines, which is better than bitter and cold worm killers. It is best for children with worm diseases to take it. If it cannot be taken internally, the garlic can be mashed into a paste and applied to the navel and stomach, and the worms will come out. Eating garlic during cholera epidemics can prevent the disease and cleanse the large intestine. Regular consumption can prevent appendicitis. Western medicine allicin is made from garlic.</p>
<h3>Seven Star Snakehead</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huai Lin</p>
<p>The vegetarian wife calls it the Seven Star Fish, which looks towards the Big Dipper at night. Its scientific name is Channa argus, commonly known as blackfish. Northerners call it 　fish. Snakehead fish are black. The large ones weigh more than two jins, and the small ones weigh about a jin. Their heads have seven stars. The gall of all mobile things is bitter, but the gall of snakehead fish is sweet.</p>
<p>Snakehead fish are mobile and like to live in water. Their muscles are strong and firm. Eating them can aid digestion and promote water circulation and promote production of body fluids. This thing does not die even if it is cut and killed, and it can still jump in the pot. It is produced everywhere, so its price is extremely cheap, so it is not valued. Lower-middle-class families often use it to make soup as a side dish.</p>
<p>Snakehead fish has a miraculous effect on treating edema. There was once a person suffering from edema who got a prescription: use one large snakehead fish, thirty scallion heads, and one piece of ginger. Boil it in half wine and half water until it is very soft and let the patient eat it, eating from head to tail, the upper part of the swelling will recede first, and eating from tail to head, the lower part of the swelling will recede first. Repeated tests have proven its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Snakehead fish gall is sweet and can treat throat paralysis. Long-term throat paralysis, swelling to the point of death when it occurs, can be cured by dabbing it with this gall. Those with deep illness should wash it with water and irrigate it, it will come back to life once it enters the throat.</p>
<p>Snakehead fish has a fat body and strong flesh, making it easy to feel full when eating, strengthening the bones and muscles, growing the muscles, and killing insects. It is also suitable after illness. It can be used to make pan-fried fried fish, steamed fish slice soup, braised fish, fish soup and other dishes, and can be eaten with winter melon to help urination and defecation.</p>
<h3>Lychee</h3>
<p>— Guocai</p>
<p>Lychees are produced in Fujian, Guangdong and other places. The skin is dark red in color and has wrinkles. The flesh is delicate, white, soft, smooth and juicy, and the taste is sweet. No other fruit can compare. But this thing cannot be eaten too much, because it is quite hot in nature. If you eat too many lychees, it is easy to cause fever, thirst, dry mouth, nosebleeds, etc. At this time, you can soak the lychee shell in water and drink it to relieve it.</p>
<p>Lychees can only be eaten as fruit when they are small, and their pits and shells have medicinal effects. For example, if a woman suffers from blood and qi tingling pain, small intestine qi pain, heart pain and other symptoms, she can roast one or two lychee pits to preserve their properties, grind them into powder, and take them with wine. Or decoct them with Achyranthes bidentata, Psoralea corylifolia, Corydalis yanhusuo, Albizia julibrissin, fennel, papaya, Eucommia ulmoides, and tangerine seeds to treat hernia; add Phellodendron amurense for deficiency heat, and add cinnamon for deficiency cold. If the swelling is like a dou, take lychee pits, green tangerine peel, and fennel in equal parts, stir-fry and grind them, then take three qian with wine three times a day. It is extremely effective.</p>
<h3>Pregnant women should be careful with their maintenance: Drink Rehmannia Congee when "leaking blood"</h3>
<p>— Ding Boan</p>
<p>From conception to delivery, a woman must go through a period of ten months. During this long process, the mother's blood must be dedicated to nourishing the fetus, so she naturally has no time to nourish other parts of the body, resulting in a pale complexion, fatigue, and lack of energy. At the same time, resistance is also weakened, so after pregnancy, you should always pay close attention to your daily life and food. In terms of movement, it is forbidden to lift high, lift objects, carry heavy objects, travel long distances, and engage in hard labor. In terms of food, avoid drinking alcohol, pepper, garlic, and other spicy and hot products in winter, for fear of disturbing the fetus and causing disease.</p>
<p>"It is easier to treat ten men than one woman." This sentence probably refers to the fact that women's diseases are hidden and complicated, and it is difficult to diagnose them. Treating pregnancy diseases requires even more thought. On the one hand, you must prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, and on the other hand, you must consider the fetus. What is more difficult is if you cannot take both into account in the condition. "Pre-natal medicine is about cooling," is an experienced medical saying, which means that doctors should use medicine that is biased towards cooling when treating pregnancy diseases. Pregnant women tend to have too much fire and heat in their bodies. Cooling medicines mostly have the effects of nourishing and moisturizing, which suits their needs, and the disease is easily cured.</p>
<p>Bleeding during pregnancy is called "leaking blood," which comes from blood heat. Treating it with Rehmannia congee is based on the above principle. Raw Rehmannia juice can nourish yin, nourish blood, cool blood, stop bleeding, and moisturize the lungs. Japonica rice has the effect of nourishing the middle and harmonizing the stomach. The method is to cook two he of japonica rice into congee, add four liang of Rehmannia juice when it is hot, mix well, and eat it on an empty stomach. Over time, the heat will naturally be calmed and the blood will stop. It is very effective, so don't ignore the rice because it is plain.</p>

Not only does it not cause stagnation, but it also strengthens the spleen. It can fill the stomach during illness, help the qi of grains, and is also suitable for recuperation after illness. (The End)</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Milk (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ding Jimin</p>
<p>Milk is hot in nature. This is a common saying. When we look at the records in the Compendium of Materia Medica, we cannot help but smile dumbly. The Compendium clearly says "sweet and slightly cold." "Sweet" means sweet, and "slightly cold" means cool. Apart from a slightly fishy smell, milk does have some sweetness. (As for the "cold" in "slightly cold", it relates to the entire pharmacology of traditional Chinese medicine. So I will not mention it here for the time being). Now, just looking at the literal meaning of the words "sweet and slightly cold," isn't it obvious that it is not hot? (Western medicine's analysis, apart from protein, fat, carbohydrates, ash, etc., and vitamins, does not have a distinction between hot and cold). So, is milk hot or cold in nature after all? Let me explain slowly.</p>
<p>We often see people from the countryside come to Shanghai, and the first time they ride a tram or car, they vomit and throw up all over the place. They must find it strange to see others standing in the car, free and comfortable, swaying back and forth, never falling down. However, when we go out and take a sea voyage, the thought of seasickness makes us miserable. Seeing the sailors and stewards are all lively and vigorous, without any pain, we are really extremely envious. In fact, it is not strange at all, it is just a matter of habit. For thousands of years, we Chinese have always been closed off, eating light tea and simple meals, vegetables, fish, and meat. Our intestines and stomachs have become very accustomed to digesting the above-mentioned items. Moreover, the ancients have always regarded milk as something eaten by barbarians. For example, in Li Ling's letter to Su Wu in the Han Dynasty, it says, "Greasy meat and cheese are used to satisfy hunger and thirst." Also, in Wang Zhaojun's lament when she married far away to the Huns, it says, "The yurt is the treasure, and felt is the wall. Meat is the food, and cheese is the drink." Both of them felt very uncomfortable eating milk and mutton, and expressed it in their poems and essays. Therefore, in ancient times, milk was not included in daily dietary items. Sun Simiao, a famous doctor and food therapy expert in our Tang Dynasty, had an argument in the twelfth volume of his book "Qian Jin Yi Fang." He said: "Milk is neutral in nature, nourishes the blood vessels, benefits the heart, grows muscles, makes the body healthy, strong, moist and shiny, the face bright and happy, and the ambition not decline; therefore, as a son, one must supply it as a regular food, not missing a day, and always making sure it is sufficient. This thing is far better than meat!" Although Mr. Sun published this experienced argument, it ultimately could not defeat the ancient Chinese idea of ​​honoring the king and resisting the barbarians, and finally the position of milk in the food and nourishment items was rejected by the scholar-officials.</p>
<p>Thus, milk, very unjustly, was cut off from the Chinese people for a thousand years. In the past hundred years, Western science has surged in like a tide, and so milk has also followed Western science and taken big steps to return to the Chinese food and nourishment items.</p>
