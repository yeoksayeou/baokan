<p>自抗戰轉入新階段後，游擊戰之作用已日見重大；軍委會通令「淪陷區」應一律改稱「游擊區」，即表示凡日軍所踐踏之地方，即應展開廣大之游擊戰爭，固不僅正名而已也。游擊戰爭雖係軍事動作，然必須與民衆運動相配合，始克成功；蓋游擊戰爭之性質，决非如在精衛所云「游來游去」之流寇式的剽掠，而實係隨時隨地可以發動之襲擊，非軍隊民衆打成一片，固無以成就此工作也。然則「配合」云云，其詞意猶且未足，無寗謂為游擊區之民衆運動，應更重於軍事動作耳。</p>
<p>夫日軍鐵蹄之所至，僅能佔領「點」「線」，不能佔領全「面」，此意盡人喻之：顧所謂點綫之地，「地」雖淪陷而「人」固未嘗淪陷也。持機械論者將以為凡地之已淪陷者根本已無「人」，蓋軍隊未退，民衆先已疏散，迨軍隊既撤，民衆亦隨赴後方，日軍所得者焦土空城，無物資亦無人民，即有留居未走者，非老弱即漢奸耳。顧實際有未盡然者：中國除少數交通都會以外，均係農業社會，鄉村固無論矣，其集居城市者亦無非地主及農業社會所需要之小商人及手工業者；農業社會之人民均安土重遷，不肯輕離鄉并，即一度忍痛拋棄其田園，不久仍必歸鄉，重理故業，試觀古來詩人騷客之所吟咏，無非聞鷓鴣而垂涕，覩明月而思鄉，絕少以壯遊勉人者也。彼日軍深悉此種心理，故佔領一地搜索屠殺之後，即故示小惠，實施「宣撫」工作，招納民衆，使避難他鄉者復歸故土，逃居村野者重返城市，故如江南各地，淪陷後僅三數月，民衆之賦歸者即已十之六七。此輩民衆初非漢奸，祗以生計所迫，旅外不易，不得不暫返家園，過其含垢忍辱之苟安生活。日軍以為此亦點綴而亦壓榨品也，乃利用漢奸，勸告復業，興辦教育，徵收租賦，推行烟賭，刀劍毒藥，兼施並用，榨取之外，復加麻醉，務使收效於槍砲炸彈以上，此亦彼之所謂民衆運動也。夫人心每貪近安而忘遠慮，閱時既久，印象易滅，日人之民衆運動，今雖未必收效，然苟假以時日，未嘗不可以掩飾其殘暴之陳迹；故為今之計，中國方面即應加強淪陷各地民衆運動之機構，教育民衆，訓練民衆，曉以大義，陳以利害，使無為勢迫，無為利誘，則此萬千民衆，目前不資敵用，異日仍為國寳。如中國方面對此放鬆一步，日本方面即得减少一分阻礙，增加一分實力，得失之間，所繫極大。故竊以為游擊區內即使無軍事動作之時，民衆運動仍應為非常重要之經常工作。</p>
<p>民衆運動方法至夥，要之不外組織與訓練兩端。組織之法宜取秘密結社形式，單位不妨較小，分布務求廣大，以游擊隊政訓工作人員總其成。他如宗教團體，行會組織，凡可資利用者均應充分利用，發揮其效力。訓練之法，除游擊戰爭所需要之軍訓以外，更須注意一般之訓練。為通俗而易於推行起見，不妨提出若干平易可行之口號，作為一般民衆共遵之信條，如「不向偽組織完糧」，「不進偽機關吃飯」「不吿密」「不上偽衙門打官司」「不送子女進偽學校讀書」「不買賣仇貨」「非必要不坐游擊區內火車輪船汽車」等項，在每一小組織內即以此信條互相宣誓，信守不渝，如有違反，小組織即加以制裁。此事至淺至易，苟能普遍推行，則錦繡山河，實際毫未淪陷，日軍之所佔者並「點」「錢」亦不如矣。</p>

<p>（一）煤炭</p>
<p>燃料之種類，既如上述之多，但煤炭在燃料中占主要部份，世界先進國家，每人口每年須燃煤平均四噸，今特將上海燃煤之來源。數量與分配等，摘要述之：</p>
<p>煤分烟煤·白煤·柴煤三大種，上海全市每年耗煤總數，由二十二年至二十六年，五年統計的為三百二十五萬公噸，平均每人口每年的合一噸弱（○·九一噸），其中的百分之十一半為白煤，而百分之一半為柴煤，其餘百分之八十七均為烟煤，為便於明瞭計，將烟煤與白煤。柴煤分述如下：</p>
<p>烟煤之來路分為國煤與進口外煤，國煤因產地與運輸關係，故分為開灤·山東·浦口·長江·華北五大路，開　　開平·澳州兩鑛區，在河北省，中英合資，亦稱國煤。</p>
<p>山東　沿膠濟路一帶煤鑛，除小數至濟南，多數在靑島出口，</p>
<p>上海之山東煤，均由靑島來為多，亦名靑島煤，如悅昇·博山·洪山·泰山等等，其中亦有中日合資者，統稱國煤。</p>
<p>浦口　在河北·山東·江蘇·河南·安徽之沿津浦綫所產烟煤，以浦口為出口集中區，運至上海，如中興·華東·山東之一部·井陘等等，在海州出口來申之煤，亦歸入此類。</p>
<p>長江　沿長江作運輸，運煤來滬各鑛，如淮南·大通·六河溝等，均稱為長江煤，灰山與長興亦屬於此類。</p>
<p>華北　華北各鑛，除開　·山東等等，自成一類之外，河北·</p>
<p>山西與山海關相近各鑛煤，如大同·山西·鬥頭溝·北票等等，用海船自秦皇島或塘沽裝運來滬，均稱為華北。</p>
<p>外煤之在上海進口者，以日煤為多，凡日本本地朝鮮台灣與關東租借區——如撫順者——均屬之，由船運而來，此外則由印度，安南，荷屬南洋羣島，及澳洲或別國來者，亦均由船運到滬</p>
<p>每年在上海耗去之二百八十三萬噸姻煤中，以上述各項來路，統計其分配如下：</p>
<p>目前悄形與前大不相同，二十七年全年以記者推求，進口烟煤全年的為四十萬噸，其中日煤的七萬噸，餘均來自英荷各屬及其他各國，開澳遝滬的共九十五萬噸，至於實耗若干實難確定，因各處或有存煤運入，但最多不過五萬噸，故二十七年全年之烟煤總耗量為一百四十萬噸，即合往年之半數，即此可知全滬各工廠之耗煤，簡接直接每年的為一百四五十萬噸。白煤來路亦分國煤與進口煤，國煤分為秦皇島，河南，山西，三種。</p>
<p>秦皇島　柳江，長城，泰記等鑛區，多在淪陷區，以秦皇鳥為出口來滬之集中區，雖在九一八之前或有中日合股，九一八之後全歸日歸人掌握，但仍以國煤視之。</p>
<p>河南　河南白煤之著名者，即為福中公司之白煤，此外小鑛亦多，均以漢口為集中出口區，自鄭州轉隴海路由浦口來滬者亦有</p>
<p>山西　晉省北部所產白煤，多由大同裝平綏車至津，由塘沽裝船來申。</p>
<p>外國白煤以來自安南者為最多，而又以鴻基為著名，馬克等亦在市上銷售，用海船自海防來申，在往年白煤已漸漸代木炭，而耗量增加，自煤球發行後，白煤屑之銷路因之大增，柳江，山西，河南來路阻斷後，安南別鑛如「同脫利」等白煤，亦大量來申。</p>
<p>每年在上海用去之三十七萬三千噸白煤之中，依據來路分配如下：</p>
<p>二十二年夏至二十四年夏　目前狀况</p>
<p>白煤之用途大都限於冬日取暖，製造日用煤球，酒菜·糖果·糕餅各店作，故其消耗量並不以戰事而减少，仍維持其每人口每年的十分之一噸之統計數，不過國煤减去，代之以進口白煤而已。</p>
<p>柴煤來路祇限於國內，多半來自浦口與長江，浦口煤如烈山（怡立）之一部分，長江煤則多半產在黃石港，如富華。利華等鑛，每年的在申銷售平均四萬七千噸，除一小部用於酒菜。食品館。供土製煤團用之外，大部為製造决等煤球，自長江封鎖之後，即來貨斷絕，目前均代之以白煤屑矣。煤球係用各處白煤屑及柴煤屑製成，其中平均含有粘土或別種粘物百分之十五以上，以科學目光視之，煤球之質决於白煤，但因其人工加土製造之後，合於土式爐灶上用，易於着火。上海共有煤球廠大小三四十家，每日出煤球的六百噸，每年的計二十萬噸左右。煤球既係白煤屑所製成，故其燃燒之有煤毒，與白煤無異，無烟囪之墟子，决不可燃煤球而在室內取暖。</p>
<p>烤炭亦係煤之一種，其易燃如木炭，在初燃時有烟，全紅後無烟，在專制時代專供皇宮生火盆之用，產於山西北部，價甚貴，在三四年前，白煤價在天津售每噸十元時，烤炭價為每噸四十五元。</p>
<p>焦炭係用烟煤屑煆燒而成，平均煤屑一百噸可得焦炭六十噸，在戰事前，上海每月消耗焦炭的二千噸，其中的五六百噸係運往杭州無錫，其合於煉焦之煤以開　·中與·井陘·六河溝等煤為最相宜。日本所產之煤，均不宜煉焦，故日本每年進口之煤以焦煤為多，焦炭均為鑄鐵。煉鋼工場所用，焦炭直接自鑛中運申者固亦有，但三分之二則就地用煤屑煉成，故焦炭之量大部已在上述全年用煤量內，即稍有出入，其數亦極微。往時市價，每噸在三十元以下，今年價近二百元，刻聞開澳在申試煉焦炭，價格或可稍平。</p>
<p>上海戰前全年所用三百二十五萬噸煤斤中其用途分配如下：</p>
<p>煤之價值向以噸計，茲將五年平均主要烟煤價值列後：煤名五年平均碼頭交貨每噸價目（以國幣計）開平一二·○〇中興一四·○○大同一二·二五山東一一·五○淮南一一·七五撫順一七·二五</p>
<p>目前價目參差無定，開平仍售廿六元送到，而印度煤則自三十八元至四十五元不等，决等日煤最低亦在三十五元上下。以後煤價恐一時無低落希望，但因有力煤商之操縱，每噸三四元之上落，則所不免。設或滙兌變更，開澳煤來源不能維持目前比例，則煤價之上漲當在意料之中。</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>性愛之要旨。首爲嗣續。此外於人身發育之大小。心理智力啓發之良窳。皆負有重要之活動力與興奮能力。關於人生思想之好壞。意志之强弱。造物者。復充以精神使其美化。而動物之生理的愛。在人類則轉變爲精神上最可尊可貴之情感。且其勢力。尤能制御其他一切精神作用。夫男女由友誼進而爲戀愛。由戀愛而結婚。而組織家庭。於是乎性愛之作用。底於大成矣。此種愛之進程爲造物之所制定。禮敎之所准許。社會之所公許。故所發精神高級之愛。乃人類歷史之維繁物。人之意志能力中最大者。莫過於戀愛。舉凡宇宙間的一切。無不從戀愛能决定其一生之命運。此誠重要之至。精力與人之精神。亦有重大關係。自表面觀之。則人之智力與推想能力。雖不直受其支配。然智力與度量。無不視其人精力之强弱而異。如人於未婚也。能保持其童貞。旣婚也。能度其有規律之生活。則其人必能因時制宜。收其智力上之效能。其心靈不受鼓蕩。精力亦不致放蕩而枯竭。頭腦冷靜。意志堅定。常保其有力之精神活動。用之以培植愛情創造事業。奠定其幸福之基礎。</p>
<p>婚後的幸福。旣决定於性愛的健全。那末怎樣才能使此性機能不現病態呢。要而言之。就是在婚前必須潔身自好。勿染上不好嗜好而斵傷身心。婚後切忌放縱。以免捲入這不幸的漩渦。而犧牲了人生莫大的幸輻。輓近內分泌學進步。對於靑春衰退。或生殖力失健等症。概可用睪丸精質製劑。男用補體康』澈底治愈。允其對於治療早洩。發育不全。婚後不妊等症的成功。巳達到臨床應用之域了。</p>
<p>『補體康』因何曾發揮此驚人功效。此蓋由於所採之成分。係從少壯動物的睪丸內提出其精質。並提煉週密所致。廿四小時內卽生精補腎。功效無敵！</p>

<p>「久咳易成癆」此幾爲婦孺皆知的警語也。蓋久咳能傷及肋膜，此時肺部感覺刺痛，爲肺病初期之象徵，但如能在此初步時期盡力求治，每能化險爲夷，就余二十餘年之經騐而觀，息者可積極內服德國治肺聖藥「補肺拿爾」鎮咳止癆有特殊功效，不論如何强烈咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」在三小時內，即可完全鎭定咳嗽。並能减除肺部酸素之功，而使癆菌失其活動力。故即使已成癆病症之喀血喀痰，氣急胸痛，盜汁潮熱等症，服之無不霍然就愈。並可根治頑固之百日咳，及老人哮喘，皆可尅日奏功也。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>……九三八年年底止「克淋儂」依然保持最高成績記錄，</p>
<p>……一切新出世之淋藥依然追不上而得不到治淋之錦標！</p>
<p>淋病一症，因其勢凶猛，而治愈亦復不易，以致患者焦苦萬分，雜藥妄投，冀共早日就痊，殊不知結果適得其反。且貽誤孔多。在余歷年臨床上，對於淋病，恒苦無適當之內服藥可用，更不必提到特效藥三字矣。而一般病家，大多淺見無知，見皇皇然之大廣吿，遂以爲實是新藥而濫行服用，結果，依然是原來之透膜殺菌與檀香油製劑之那一流之貨色而已。余爲淋病專家，對於每年新出品之淋樂，莫不一一嘗試，結果無不二失敗，覺得市上新藥之多，雖如雨後春笋，而名不符實者爲最多。</p>
<p>歷史昭示吾人，眞理不可磨滅，眞藥不可淘汰，德國彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」，風行五大洲，已歷有年所，各國淋病學專家，及花柳病院等，莫不以「克淋儂」爲淋病之內服藥，對新舊男女一切白濁，如攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀膀炎，關節炎，前後尿道炎，女子淋毒性白帶等服「克淋儂」莫不迅速全愈，據一九三八年十二月間柏林醫學研究會之報吿，謂「克淋儂」一藥，在本年開，仍保持淋病治騐成績之最高紀錄，德國爲世界醫學最進步之國家，其言洵可爲淋病特效「克淋儂」一藥之保證云。願淋病患者之注意焉！</p>

<p>攝護腺在膀胱之前，其四周環繞的神經甚多。自凟及房事過度者，致局部的神經衰弱，失其統制的權，故易於漏下。據專家的研究，所謂滑精之症，爲慢性攝護腺炎的一種症狀，如淋病，膀膀疾患，房事過度，自凟等。都能使搆護腺有發生慢性炎症的可能。患此症者，不特尿道口常有精液狀之物流出，且有種種神經的證狀，如性慾減退，早洩，遺精，腎萎，背痛，頭重，腰酸，眩暈，心悸，怠倦，與恐怖觀念等。患者的性情，亦日趨於陰鬱沉憂，對於個人的命運，常抱悲覜，感本人的疾病，過於重篤，精神上的活動力，因此減退，其結果往往發生悲觀。</p>
<p>本症的治療，第一在淸心寡慾，以避免局部神經的刺激，至於藥物治療，唯有服以「耐而斯遺精片」立有確效，該劑功能鞏固精關，減輕勃起神經的過敏性，不倫任何凶惡之遺精，滑精，服後頃刻個止，且有安靜大腦神經之功，使有常習性失眠症者，充分有獲治的機會，故其功效勝過固精片百倍。凡會服市上各種固精片無效者，不妨一試木品，保證有名符其實的功效。</p>

<p>— 小于先生</p>
<p>這幾天亞洲大戲院的國際舞台上，正當「中華」，「大和」，兩班串着全武行連台好戲的當見，忽的趕跑了兩個頗頗有名的掃邊老生。說也蹊蹺，這兩個老生的名字都呌做什麽「衛」。按說呢，老生本當掛正牌，無奈唱的是殺打戲，老生之屈居掃邊也宜矣！</p>
<p>「中華」班老生的下台，是爲了一個妬字。他不愛聽正角武生的連堂彩聲，他偏要趁正角掉轉馬鞭使出拖刀妙計當兒，直着嗓子唱兩句高調，弄得塲面先生忙不迭的敲鑼鼓助威，又要拉胡琴托腔，究竟琴聲掩不過鑼聲，台下誰也不聽他那一套「鷄食盆裏鴨挿嘴」的高調，他終於一氣就氣跑了。</p>
<p>「大和班」老生是極力想討好正角的。正角槍花亂耍的當兒，他原也會瞪瞪眼吹吹鬍子助助威，正角出台，甚至還肯掮槍帶馬。只恨他爸媽少生了三頭六臂，伺侯不好這些正角門的蹩扭脾氣，終於「頂石臼做戲」的知難而退。他就壞在一個乏字哇！</p>
<p>但掃邊究竟是個配角，配角得力，固然越見精彩，使下台，也無關大局。只要正角不　紗帽，拿手戲决不停鑼。你看不是一班新角已經掛牌，一班也已接唱有人嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c136">從百歲老人馬相伯說起 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>連日報上所載馬相伯百齡大慶，確屬是國家人瑞，尤其是馬相老，是革命的先進，文化的前驅，以百歲老翁，而仍主張抗戰，這就是他車高年之徵。現在的靑年們，往往以年齡的大小，有所謂老朽腐化，這是孩子們見解。其實腐化不腐化，不應看他的年齡，應看他的行事。如其靑年陶醉於聲色貨利塲中、爲拜余主義所屈服了，一切不顧，做那苟且無恥卑鄙齷齪的勾富，雖不謂之腐化，不可得也。我們要想到矍鑠鑠哉是翁」之伏波將軍馬援，以高齡尙能遠涉山川去平南；再看三國志裏的老將黃忠，是何等精神！所以王勃說：「老當益壯，寗知白首之心；窮且益堅，不墜靑雲之志。」這正是現代靑年所當取鑑而傚法的！</p>
<p>講到馬相老的生辰，是生於消道光二十年庚子三月十六日，卽西曆一八四〇年四月，到民國二十八年的今年，確是百歲老翁了。</p>
<p>但是照中國舊時有一種計算百歲的速威方法，馬相老在今年不止是百歲了。這方法就爲巳有九十餘歲年紀的人，想提早做那百齡大慶，於是將每年作十二個月計算，又將閏月提出來，扣足幾年，再加到年歲上去，那就可提早一兩年慶祝百歲了。如照此算法，馬相老到去年（民國廿七年）爲止，經過的閏月，計有：</p>
<p>閏二月　四　閏三月　五</p>
<p>閏四月　五　閏九月　一〇</p>
<p>閏六月　四　閏七月　五</p>
<p>閏八月　三　閏十月　一</p>
<p>合計　三七那末照十二個月一年計算，再加上三十七個閏月，又是三年零一個月，道不是今年要一百零三歲麽？但是這一種計算，原不足法，何况又是科學頭腦的馬相老，决不肯取巧呢！</p>
<p>民國以來，對於民間種種良習慣的培養，是不甚注意的。要知敬老不但是尊敬或難能可貴的一種表示，也是獎勵人民善於攝生，把大家的年齡都提高起來，是民族康齡强健的一種微象，所以前代莫不有敬老慈幼的一種措施。遠的不必說，單拿淸代講，壽民至百歲者例得建百歲坊以資旌表，並且還給他建坊銀三十兩。到了雍正四年七月，有河南杞縣壽民蕭俊德，年屆一百十八歲，雍正特加倍發給他的建坊銀。而且定了一個例，說：建坊銀子，嗣後年至一百十歲，加一倍，一百二十歲加兩倍，有多得壽算者按其壽算加倍。就在這一年，戶部奏報賞給直隸各省七十歲以上至百歲以上的壽民，共有一百四十二萬一千六百二十五名，照那時候人口比例計算，大的年高的人，要占到二十分之一啊！可想當時的人享年，大槪遠出今人之上。</p>
<p>最可爲長壽之徵，要推雍正十二年二月有一起旌表老年的事件了。父子六人，合計五百零三歲，這是廣東興寗縣人幸登運，他自己一百零二歲，他的長子幸伯達，這年八十二歲，决子幸伯玉年八十歲，三子幸伯錦年七十八歲，四子幸伯旺年七十四歲，五子幸嘉賓年六十七歲，父享高年，五個兒子亦享高年，可謂門眉壽了。</p>
<p>又看到馬相老的兩位外甥，一位是朱志堯先生，今年是七十七歲，走起路來，寫出字來，那裏看得出他是將近八旬的老翁了，還是雄糾糾，氣昂昂，背不傴僂，足不趦趄，大有老英雄褚彪神氣。他的介弟朱季琳先生，今年也是六十六歲了，依然是翩翩風韻，不减當年，猶似四十許人，這都是長壽之微，將來享年都不讓乃舅哩！</p>

<p>“There　Goes　My　Heart”　聯美公司出品　弗德立馬區主演</p>
<p>「價絲飛繞一與其說它是「喜劇，」母寗說是鬧劇」。一個因祖父「珍如拱璧，」致行動全失自由」的少女，在一個難得的機會中終於作紐的之行。在她登岸以後，「躑躅於途，飢渴難忍「的時候，遇見了百貨商店售貨員碧姬，因亦「入店服務」。請那些高貴的小姐，從家庭里出來，而踏進百貨商店去體騐一下實生活，這，該不能說壞的；但是「情絲飛繞」的主題並不在這里，它是利用這機會來使這位女主人公的「情絲」「飛繞一於一位新聞記者身上，於是，一情絲飛繞一展開了一幕大「喜劇」。</p>
<p>這個十足好萊塢型的故事，在演出上却並沒有好萊塢化。或許這樣是頗適合於一般外國紳士，太太的胃口的，但對於中國觀衆，這樣並不是挺好的表演方式。</p>
<p>導演Norman　Z．Mcleod固然是運用了許多所謂「噱頭」，如：比爾到游艇上去拍攝瓊的照片，却錯認了她的女僕；介紹碧姬出塲的時候，穿挿了她和飯肆經理的一塲鬥口；瓊在百貨商店里招待主顧時的手址無措；碧姬和她情人的接吻，及那樣複雜的一個名字上的趣味；比爾偷攝瓊的照片，結果都沒有攝得盧山眞面……及最後比爾和瓊在沙島上的結合。那些噱頭面然還得「對白」的帮助，但導演不能把整個戲的發展處理得非常輕快，活潑，「噱頭」　祗是一噱頭」而巳。比校起來，還是最後那塲戲，較爲可取。</p>
<p>茀德立馬區是倘多方面的演員，他演過「化身博士」，演過復活」，演過「星海浮沉錄，演過新水滸」，他都能把握各個不同的角色的個性，而發揮他的洗煉的演技，但這里所飾的記者比爾，簡直不能有所發展，這是劇本和導演都有關係的。同樣，薇琪妮白羅絲也是平平而已。</p>
<p>飾碧姬的潘倩凱莉，和十三點」瓊黛維絲同樣有趣，是一個可愛的丑角。</p>

<p>那個女醫師姓章，喚做章文綺女醫師，是位守貞不嫁的老姑娘。平日閒信道很篤，她也是以救人濟難爲務的一位女敎士。素來也知道朱老源的爲人，她便答應他了。把這朱老源的孫女領來一看，雖則是個鄉下小姑娘，倒也淸淸秀秀，伶伶俐俐。年紀不過七八歲，問她幾句話兒，却也對答如流。因爲朱老源就只有這個孫女兒，也敎她認得幾個字，連初級小學敎科書，已經讀過兩三本了。她初來的時候，不免有點兒哭泣思家，但經章醫帥哄哄她，究竟是個小孩子，不到幾大，就很熟了。原來章醫師開的就是一個婦孺醫院，這婦隭醫院中，最注重的，就是產科與兒科。向來中國人的產兒收生，付託於那種不學無術的老嫗手中，每年工夫，枉死的嬰兒，不知有多少。允其那些鄉村與貧民人家。後來中國漸漸地有了產科醫生咧，助產士咧，這不過都是在通都大邑之間，而且取費極昂。至於稍爲荒僻的地方，就沒有了。章醫師這個婦孺醫院，雖然設立在這個大市鎭上，那個大市鎭的周圍，便有鄕村不少呀。其次就是小兒科，本來產科與兒科，是有連帶關係的。不過他們的兒科，較爲道地認眞，是有專門小兒科的醫師，在那裏主持的。自從戰事一起，逃難的人就很多，那些逃難的婦女中，當然懷了孕，大了肚子的人也很多，在這個時候生產，眞是苦難極了。章醫師那時便設了個難民產科醫院，爲了救助那班臨產的婦女。及至生產以後，竟然有一班婦女，不能養育嬰兒，把嬰兒棄置在醫院中的，道有什麽辦法呢？因此章醫師使不能不又設立一個育兒院了，好把這些棄兒孤兒聚在一處。自然要章醫師一人的經濟力量，也是不够，幸虧有許多人帮忙。人是有感情的動物，除非是那班以殘暴侵略爲政策的人。只要你的事業辦得好，大家都肯解囊相助的。因此章醫師在經濟上倒還可以過去，這也是全靠章醫師的熱心努力，所以中外人士都贊助她，一個女士們能如此的，也不容易呀。　（七）</p>

<p>— 音員</p>
<p>自一九三三年起，德國的電影事　便陷入進退維谷的境地。在國內放映的影片不得不爲第三德意志歌功頌德，傳佈國家社會主義的精神。影片公司要賺錢，非把影片推銷出國不可，但是許多國家都反對國社主義的觀念。一九三一年，德國輸出的影片總値五千九百萬馬克，到一九三七年，「消滅影業破壞份子」之後，輸出影片僅値七百二十萬馬克，國社主義的影業淸淡，不用說，德國的影片的水準也低落了。</p>
<p>德國影片水準低落的主因之一，是因爲最優秀的製片家，導演，劇作家，和明星的遭驅逐出國，不可勝計；最前進的喜劇明星格倫蓬，以及其他幾個奧國的影片藝術家被押禁在集中營裏。</p>
<p>德國所攝製的並非全是民族主義和軍國主義的影片，數年前，德國創攝短歌劇影片，且自一九三三年起，便有攝製短歌舞影片之風，藝人欣茲爾把這種影片的水凖提高起來，德國在新政權統治下曾攝製可愛的音樂戲片是不能吾認的，可是，欣茲爾現在也離開了德國而上好萊塢去了。德國影片的不健全，第二個原因是政洽檢查，官方生限制，越來越多，現在德國電影的命令和查禁之多，竟至沒有人完全知悉。</p>
<p>第三個原因更深奧，原來德國心理的和現實的影片常可以見到它的力量，德國影片首先創造以文學的，心理的和社會的題材爲製片的特質，然而現在這種影片也不能攝製了，第三德意志不得談及嚴重的社會問題，以心理上的題材，也只准在嚴格限制之內攝製。</p>
<p>今日德國的電影裏，以及許多小說和短篇故事裏，都有殘忍的軍國主義的精神侵入了。但也並不是每部影片都有公開的政治宣傅，烏發，托璧士，都拉，和巴伐利亞各攝影塲還拍攝偵探和冒險故事的影片，但可以觀察到一種奇怪的現象，便是這種影片的劇情都以他國爲背景，暗殺，竊盜，暴虐，無憐憫心的惡棍，都是使人激動的劇情裏所不可缺少的。但官方法令說是德國不再有這種暗殺等事情存在，總算　運。製片商可以用英法美或其他國家來做背景，而攝製這種影片，例如預定一九三九年攝製的，就有用阿拉斯加，智利，菲洲，挪成，和美國作背景的許多影片。只有日本和意大利，才不把它們用做爲非作歹的背景和惡棍的集居地，關於影片一節，日本和德國有密切的合作，由德人芬克博士導演的「武士道之女」一片，便是日德聯合攝製的第一片。德國到處都放映日本影片，例如赫斯魯導演的「日本之力量」，和德日聯合影片社攝製的魔手一等等。德政府且逐漸誘勸日本减少外國影片的輸入，俾多映德意的影片，德　亦合作　製影片，預定明年將合攝巨片三部，國社主義的宣傳影片，在德國到處放映，還豫備拍攝一部名呌「和平之劍」的影片，內容是描寫」其他國家裏布爾什維克的階級爭鬥導成「流血的擾亂，」另一方面則描寫「德國爲和平而努力。」</p>

<p>揚州自古繁華，是一個人傑地靈的地方，不說別的，單以最近遊藝界中藝人來說，像中外聞名的十三旦，像劇界大王的梅蘭芳，都係籍隸綠楊城郭，戲劇之於揚州，確有悠久相當的歷史。</p>
<p>揚州戲初無劇本，演者無師無傳，無格無規，信口而歌，自成腔調。這種藝術天才。眞神乎其技，歡爲觀止。後來提倡揚州戲的，組班邀角，甄別人才，編採劇本，添置行頭，於是揚州戲粗具規模，始有地位。</p>
<p>本市各遊戲塲的揚州戲，業巳經過數度改革，站在藝術化的陣錢上了。言其成績，在一般人的印象中閒，也有不少歡迎的贊詞。未來的趨勢，假使精進不懈，可與蘇州的灘簧，四明的文戲，不難鼎足而三。不過，滬人士的看揚州戲，大都當它是文明戲的一種，對於情節與歌詞，却不像看文明戲的感覺興趣，也不像聽文明戲的容易明白。所以揚州戲的發展力，北方的平津，反比南方的蘇杭，來得適宜，因爲揚州白與北音，校爲接近的緣故揚州戲中的　竹，　爲各地所無，有笙，有簫，有笛，有胡琴，有箏琵，有鑼鼓，把各種樂器，運用於一時，高下疾徐，中節悅耳，這種優點，確是地域鍾靈，人間那得幾回聞的維揚特色。</p>

<p>賡春曲社前天下午在卡爾登大戲院爲救濟難民演出，崑曲自仙霓社在東方劇塲抓住一部份的觀衆以後，也漸漸占據戲劇界良好的地位，所以昨天的成績，沒有使主辦者失望。</p>
<p>一點多鐘，塲內已差不多擠滿了人，我進塲的時候，臺上褂着紫絨的守舊，中間繡着極顯賡春兩個黄色的篆字，大概開鑼未久，還正在那裏跳着加官。</p>
<p>在塲內，我發現了不少伶界，像王熙春，于素蓮，劉斌崑等，她和他們都研究着崑曲，這是她們觀摩的機會。跳完加官以後，便是全部鐵冠圖的開始，第一齣是陳寳謙的借餉，他頭髮已經斑白，而目爲了參加道决的義務戲，特地將他保養的鬍鬚剃了，接着便是孫鈞卿，徐凌雲的別母亂箭，鈞卿是擅演　簧的名票，這時我纔知道他也精於崑劇，凌雲飾周遇吉的母親，演唱都很賣力，右臂並因而酸痛，扮鬼一塲，是由別人代替的，鐵冠圖演到刺虎爲止，連下來是速環計小宴和獅吼記跪池，散塲時巳過了六點。</p>
<p>班底是向仙霓社借用，我在後　碰見一位前輩施桂林君，他是故名崑伶施傳鎭（此人中前應老生，和麒麟童最稱莫逆，麒研究崑曲，從他得到益處很多，（的父親，向在南京，戰後纔來申，加人仙霓社，一方面還敎着戲，像王熙春，金素雯，張慧聰，于素蓮，葛次江，王蘭芳等，都從他習藝。我看完戲出來，非常滿意，感到崑曲雖不普遍，還不致於沒落。</p>

<p>去年菊部瑣事，頗有足述者，輙就記憶所及，得隱，拜，控，寫四則，摭述如次：</p>
<p>隱坤伶髪生孟小冬，嗓音淸動，念作俱有造脂，在平時時有出演，如失衛亭捉放珠廉寒諸譯派劇，海報甫揭，即有傾動風城之槪。客春以病嗓　演，自　即灰心歌舞生涯，與故都諸女擅越出人某寺，誦經禮　，儼然成爲一女修士，按小冬年華正盛，驟趨消極，與郝壽臣之遽萌退休，　同一爲去年梨園界之不幸事也，</p>
<p>控小鳥王熙春以秦歌女，下海爲伶，居然一鳴驚人，由京而漢，所至有聲。去歲來孤島，隸　爾登出演後，譽之者益衆，秋間忽以毀誘謗罪控某戲報等於法院，於去庭上大談其「褲帶鬆緊」問題，一時報章騰載，與毛劍秋王樁柏之表演過於認眞，涉及乳部問題，引起某報筆戰，同爲去年戲劇界留一汚點。</p>
<p>拜金又琴爲二牌旦魚之佼佼者，扮象頗有丰韵，沽上瓜圃老人金少保，捧之甚力，甚至賜以所居日琴去夏，少保六十壽誕，少數知友設宴於琴台以爲祝，並以茉莉花朶綴成二大壽字，分貽息老及又琴，宴後合攝一影，顏之曰「拜金圖，」韵事流傳，一時稱盛，而尙荀程等紛收弟子，故都拜師者踵相接，則父爲去年戲劇界之佳活也妥。</p>
<p>寫伶人書法，見於報章雜誌；比比可數，而富於書卷氣者，自以時慧實為上乘。上月，津門由尙和玉程繼仙，蕭長華，王福連，及時等梨園五老所發起之「老伶工聯歡大會」中，時出演各戲，俱為小生劇作，戲迷傳當塲書「祝君康寗」四字，筆致遒勁，所作頌揚語尤得體，以視林樹森演戲迷傳時之寫「六〇六」三字，一雅一俗，誠有霽壞之判矣！</p>

<p>（上略）來在常，無受傷事，明春或返滬。季，冬。電末署名「季」，蓋唐生明字「季溰」也。（其長兄唐生智，字孟瀟。）觀乎此電，可證徐來固在常德，安然無恙，而墮機傷足之說，係出誤傳無疑矣。</p>

<p>— 松風水月廬主</p>
<p>坤伶王慧蟾，名琴師伯水先生之女公子也。家學淵源，能戲頗多。嘗問藝於名伶王瑤卿等，頗蒙讚許，認爲後起之秀，去歲偶於慈善劇中，登台客串，驚才絕艷，輒爲顧曲者所擊節稱賞。而慧蟾則受寵若驚，益事謙抑，閉門習藝，力求深造。最近應更新主人之的，一切包銀條件，均有成議，旋忽因小故未能諒解，遂告輟議。而某戲院適有重整旗鼓，復演平劇之議，於是遂由林樹森之介，聘女士爲台柱，業於去歲大除夕登台演唱，其打泡戲如廉錦風，玉堂春等，均爲得意傑作也。余以年來疏懶成性，久不涉足劇塲，元旦之晚，爲老友馬君笠，邀往觀，歸來有感，爰賦一律以張之。詩云：</p>

<p>— 羊公鶴</p>
<p>當將七用命，以爭取最後勝利的現在。跳舞無疑是一種不正軌的舉動。可是孤島的舞業，在抗戰發動時，雖曾一度衰敗，到目下則反見畸形的發達，說起來確很値得感慨的一件事。不過，成家立業者跳跳舞，散散心，尙情有可原，獨學生則爲國家未來之主人翁，苟其於學生時代即縱情聲色，那末他的學問，一定至於不堪問聞，而他一生的前途，也就永久慘淡了！所以道是最要不得的</p>
<p>王佩英女士，她現在雖然操舞女生涯於國泰舞廳，然而她却深明此層道理，放而並不如一般舞女的唯錢是要，當學生向她要求伴舞時，她始終以婉言拒絕，最近她又曾經用嚴厲的態度，來阻止某一學牛爲入幕之賓。爰記錄其經過如後</p>
<p>有一位××中學的學生，當他第一次向王女十邀好的時候，她即以冷待的狀態，吿以學生當埋首書本，不宜耽於逸樂的話，誰知此君顏厚，還是一再擾纏不淸，逼使她第二步採用了聲色俱厲，嚴加叱責的手段，第三步便避不見面。在她如此决絕的意志下，終使某君悻而退。</p>
<p>她那種態度，我認爲頗足加以贊許。並且希望整個舞界的舞星，皆能效法王女士之所爲，如此則一般莘莘學子，雖其中有自甘墮落的，也就墮落無門，跳舞罪戾，當能藉此减輕不少吧。</p>

<p>鞋之種類</p>
<p>（乙）　　鞋　輪鞋亦購上品者。下品輪鞋，四輪均裝住在底板上而不　絡。上品者則有橡皮墊。輪鞋之所以能隨意左右活動，全賴此墊。無此則無異一普通四輪車。祗便直行耳。兩鞋前後輪之橡皮墊。須同樣厚薄軟硬。否則不能善其事。輪鞋橡皮墊，各鞋不同。故租鞋用者，　難能顯其長。而又難精輪鞋之長短。亦視用者之高矮而定。大的自前輪中心，至後輪中心，爲五英寸至七英寸之距離。若輪鞋釘任在皮鞋上者。則輪鞋底須較皮鞋底短一英寸。輪鞋　冰鞋爲複雜。除擦拭乾凈加油外。尤須注意四輪之有無損傷。以防不測。</p>
<p>（丙）　皮鞋　皮鞋亦須定製。如址踝用包扎布。則購鞋時須將包布包上。免後有尺寸太小之虞。鞋須平跟。鞋　須從近鞋　處起。如普通之球鞋。鞋帶縛　時，皮鞋上面鞋面蓋不可合攏。因日久上面兩邊之鞋面蓋，會漸漸加長。故須相離一英寸。鞋舌宜闊，而能遮沒鞋面之開口。鞋舌宜變層。中間或墊棉花，或用軟墊。襪宜較平時所穿者爲厚。</p>
<p>初學入門</p>
<p>初學者，未入塲前。可在家練習與跑冰有關之各項運動。若因從未練過而覺足踝無力，不能站定在冰鞋底之薄刀口上，以致第一次入塲毫無興趣。則最好在家，將冰鞋穿上。在平地上先行練習跨步。鞋底之刀口，須用布包沒。免損地板或地毯。起始鞋不宜縛得太緊。待有進步。再稍縛緊可也。</p>
<p>初入塲時，敏覺地滑而不易於行走。如一足欲向前進。第二足反往後瀉。致頗有　步維艱，欲行不得之感。按此，實因溜冰與走路，根本不同。走　爲提一足，移前。將身之重心，移至該足後。再提弟二足。溜冰則將全身，自第一足傾前。使第二足衝出而在冰上流動時。再將第一足移前。落地。以便第二足推進也。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>不佞什歲旅居故都的時候，曾在榮稚峯（榮祿姪）府上，聽他談過「二進宮」劇中，徐彥昭懷抱的那柄銅錘，（彥昭並無大功於王室，恐怕此錘還是中山王的遺物。）現在依然留存在人間，榮君並且親眼目覩過兩决，據說這件寳物現藏在東交民巷的徐某家中。這位徐君就是徐彥昭的後人，在淸季也作過很大的官，他府裏還有明朝開國　勳中山壬徐達的畫像，及其他的許多遺物。不佞祖籍徐州，不僅是與徐達同姓，並且他還作過敝邑的賢令尹。馬連良這决新排的「串龍珠」，就是「徐達反徐州」的化名。因爲有上述的種種原因，當時却很想請榮君介紹到徐府上賞鑑這些珍寳，如能得到物主的同意，還想攝成幾張照片，刋在書報上，公諸同好，這倒是一椿很有趣味的事兒。後來因爲忽怱南下，就將這事擱起，現在想起來還很覺是件憾事，只好俟將來北上的時候，再繼續完成造件工作了。</p>
<p>端方初任湖北巡撫的時候，不佞有兩位鄉長，都隨他在該省供職。一位是作過湖北臬台的黃伯雨，一位是在他幕中的許鶴成；據這二人講起端方這人極嗜古玩，並且也很好戲劇，後來他代理湖廣總督，每値新年令節，就要招集名伶演劇，夏月潤的老兄夏月恒，居然也棄優而仕，當了他的武巡捕，這也足見他愛護優伶之一斑了。他有一次得了「長板坡」糜夫人投井的那個井口，他非常得意，他說這件東西，很有保存的價値，倘使當年沒有這個井，葬埋了那位義烈的糜夫人，那麼趙子龍雖然英勇無敵，也得命喪亂軍之中。試想百萬的曹兵，將他困在垓心，子龍一人，須兼顧着阿斗同受了箭傷的縻夫人，這兩條性命，他身爲大將，再把戰馬讓興夫人乘騎，一人步行應戰，如何能段退百萬雄兵，結果這三人一馬的性命，全得死在曹兵之手。劉備如若死了這位常勝將軍，後來黄鶴樓赴宴，東吳招親，截江奪斗，甚至於連營寨救駕，空城計嚇退司馬這許多緊要危急的大事，都沒有第二個人能担當解救下來，恐怕劉玄德的漢中王也作不成功。更談不到成都稱帝與魏吳三分天下，像劉禪那個小混蛋，越發不能享受數十年的後主尊榮，同黄皓弄得個亂匕八糟了。由此看來，「長板坡」的這面井，的確是劉備父子的恩物，就連糜夫人　義烈，趙子龍的忠勇，也無不是此井成全了他們的美名呢。後來端方奉派五大臣出洋，回國後又升任兩江總督，也把牠帶到南京，及至他調往四川，中途被殺，這面井口也就不知下落了。</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>——有了健全的身體才有偉大的事業——</p>
<p>諸位：都是未來的主人翁，所以你們大家都應該負起建國救國的責任，允其現在正是「抗戰建國一的時候，對於鍜鍊我們的身體，實在不容一刻緩了：你不看見列强各國軍備競爭的狂熱嗎？但是他們雖然是强盛之邦，科學昌明，財力寬裕，民智發建，還是很努力地鍜鍊國民的身體，以備將來禦侮保國衛民之用。返觀祖國屢遭侵略，至今日又在抗戰奮鬭中的中國人民，却毫不注意自己的身體，我覺得非常遺憾憾，小朋友，速即覺醒呀！</p>
<p>「有了健全的身體，才有偉大的事業。」這確是金科玉律的話，你小看見住在上海收容所裏的許多兒童，因爲給養的不足，就有不少的兒童，爲了生病而致死，恐怕這「死亡率」的數字很可驚吧！倘使這許多死去的兒童，不受到逃難的痛苦，也許不會死掉，說不定他們都有偉大的事業，前程無量。一方面是遭到惡劣環境的原因，一方面也是自己身體太弱的緣故，病菌的侵入，完全基於身體不健全而不能抵抗病菌所致。那沒死去的兒童，便是證明他們的身體，一定是比死去的兒實强健，你們以爲如何？「强國先强種，强種要强身，强身須體育。」體育，中國提倡了好久，但是成績何在？我們記得出席世運時，歸來只有〇分，道是丟臉的事！也可以知道我國的體育太幼稚了！我們太不努力了！果然也是未經合理的倡導，和一般社會人士的忽略，佔着重大的原因。體育的功效；對於個人，可以使虛弱身體，逐漸銀鍊成强健而有爲；對於國家民族，更能建立一偭强盛的國家，健全的民族。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們愛運動嗎？運動是使我們的肌肉，堅實而發達，由發達而充實，由充實而健全。尤其我們小朋友，正當身體發育的黃金時代，應該特別努力！否則，如果不能獲到圓滿的發育，那末，國家民族的前途，是非常憂慮的。你們一面必須讀書，一面也要努力運動，你們的父母師長一定會前來指導的。不過，我們「讀書的時候用功讀書，運動的時候努力運動。」强國是基於强民，强健的人民，才可以負起建國救國的重大的責任，最後我們要高呼：趕快「鍜鍊我們的身體！」小朋友！醒醒吧！起來努力呀！努力呀！</p>
<h3 id="c178">成績單 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 淺笑</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們的學校快要放寒假了罷。當老師把本學期的成績單發給你的時候，你作何感想？</p>
<p>如果你的成績惡劣，有幾種功課不及格，你接到了成績單，羞愧得面紅耳赤，同時，對着被老師獎勵的同學，有嫉妬的心理。羞愧是應該的，你要羞愧，並且自責過去的不肯努力；但是別去嫉妬用功的同學，你自己喪失獎勵的機會啊。</p>
<p>如果你的成績優良，心裏很覺愉快，對於被老師譴責的同學，輕視或是譏笑。愉快是應該的，努力半載，有這樣的收穫，自然「心花怒放」。可是不要輕視或譏笑那些怠惰的同學，應該勉勵他們。</p>
<p>我知道小朋友們的脾氣，拿到了滿意的成績單，回到家中，往往不等家長詢問，就笑嘻嘻地把成績單給家長看。成績不好的小朋友，把一張成績單塞在書包裹，「沒精打采」地回家，不作一聲，當作沒有這件事一樣，直等家長討着看，方纔從書包裹慢慢地找出來，側着臉丟在家長的手裏。</p>
<p>「往者不追，來者猶可及」。「失敗是成功之母。無論那一位小朋友，要有在下學期裏格外努力的决心。現在成續好的，切勿自滿；成績壞的，快向家長老實承認過去的錯誤，更勉勵自己，求學業的進步。</p>

<p>— 槐</p>
<p>愛華和樂華的家裏，這天佈置得多美麗啊！在大門口，褂上四個大花球蕩呀蕩的！國旗也很莊　地　　，去年雙十節買的二盞花燈，這天也掛起來了！愛華畢竟是大了些，那大門上面，這「新年同樂會」五個大字，寫得多麼有勁呀！</p>
<p>這天在門口做招待的，倒不是二個小主人，原來這靠邊的紅紙球旁，還有一隻活潑的鸚鵡呢！今天它也特別高興，新學會的「客人請進」一句，也比往常婉轉了。</p>
<p>一羣小朋友，五個女的，二個男的，他們都穿着紅紅綠綠的新衣，手牽手的，跳呀跳的，張開着笑口，走到愛羅的家門，品芳以鄰居的資格，領導着六個小朋友進去，上面的鸚鵡接着呌了七次，它表示每一個客人都應該招待，不能厚此薄彼的。</p>
<p>一會兒，連愛華和樂華一共九個人，圍坐在一張蓋着白檯毯的圓桌四面，愛華是主人，所以被推爲主席而站了起來，她首先呌他們拿帶來的糖菓，都放在自己的面前，這雪白的檯毯上點綴着顏色紙句的糖菓，也就益顯得美麗而悅目了。當他們吃得很高興，講得很起勁的時候，有一個小朋友發現了一個孩子乞丐，站在他們會塲的門口，他驚奇的呌喊，於是全會塲的小朋友，都拿奇怪的目光掃射這可憐的孩子，可是愛華和品芳却呆了，伊倆認爲在今天的環境裹，他要算是最可憐的人哪！於是品芳就搶着提議了：「大家看！這小朋友多可憐呀！我主張呌他也參加我們這同樂會！」道提議頃刻全體都贊成，大家推主席去招待他進來，這時道可憐的小朋友的臉上也露出會心的微笑了。</p>
<p>品芳，伊最會出主意，她又提議請愛華的媽媽來訓話。去請過以後，愛華的媽媽也不客氣的下樓了，伊一進會塲，就看見這幾個孩子當中，夾着一個衣衫襤褸的小朋友，伊不奇怪，伊明白這一定是他們天眞同情的表現呀！接着伊就說了下面的一段話：</p>
<p>「世界上的小朋友，再沒有比你們那樣偉大了！你們沒有大人的指導，能够做出這樣可貴的事來，今天我贊成得簡直沒有話說了！不過再有一個意思，要貢獻給你們的，就是願你們從今天起，立定志向，努力節約，用省下的錢，救救像這位同樣可憐的小朋友，這樣今天你們的同樂會，才是最有價値的了。」</p>
<p>「拍拍拍……」這聲昔約摸繼續了一分多鐘，最後他們同擎着杯子，滿滿的喝了一大杯開水！</p>
<h3 id="c180">天花與種痘 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 奚凰輝</p>
<p>小朋友，只耍大家在馬路街頭稍稍留意一點的話，準可在各個要口的電桿木上，張貼着紅綠二色的勸種牛痘的圖畫。同時，依據近日的報載，孤島正流行着天花，死亡率也相當的大，當局正在密切的注意着這件事。</p>
<p>所謂天花，是一種兇暴的傳染病，人一患了天花，縱然僥倖不死，但是必弄得一臉麻子，麻子麻花臉，多麼難看啊。共實，天花果然給予人們這樣兇暴的侵襲，人們也在事前給它一個致命的打擊，使它沒有一點暴發的活力，要做到道樣，除了佈種牛痘之外，絕對沒有第二條生路。</p>
<p>牛痘是英國人琴南發明的，取牛身上的痘漿製成痘苗，再移種在人身上，就可免出天花。人們每種一次牛痘，要是結果良好的話，可保五年至七年不患天花，不過幼小的孩子，最好每年種一次，稍大以後，大約再種三次，就可保證終身不患天花。種牛痘的好處，在這裏不說也可明曉了。</p>
<p>不過種了牛痘以後，必須注意五件事；（一）癢時切不要用手搔，（二）膿疱切不可損傷，（三）注意衣服的淸潔，（四）不作劇烈的運動，（五）種痘以後，一個月內不可洗澡。</p>
<p>小朋友！天花的危險，種痘的益處，想來大家已經知道，為預防麻臉及死亡計，還是趕快去種牛痘吧。</p>

<p>— 阜春小學五年級生　曹宏輝</p>
<p>光陰過得很快，一轉瞬間，又是二十八年的新年，那我也加上一歲了。世界上的人類，由兒童到成人，有的轟轟烈烈，做出一番事業來，給大衆謀福利，造福羣衆。有的無聲無臭，有的賣國求榮，有的流爲盜賊，這都是敎育不普及的緣故。</p>
<p>但是，用甚麽方法來糾正這不良的影響呢！應該先從兒童着想，所以我們受敎育的兒童，應當要有些知識，到了新年，不嬰導作無意味的遊戲，况且現値非常時期，想想戰區裏的兒童，衣不暖體，食不得飽肚，生活是何等可憐，我們住在租界上的兒童們，應該替他們想想，用什麼方法來救救他們？我想在這新年裏頭，爸爸媽媽和親長給我們的錢，節省下來，大家來捐助捐助，積少成多，迭福難童，一面自己還可以趁這假期，溫習功課，埋頭苦幹，小的時候刻苦耐勞，養成習慣，將來謀替社會服務，那是我們做兒童，也就不辜負又大一歲了。</p>

<p>諸位小朋友們，你們不是都歡迎賀年片的嗎？但是我也有許多同學所寄給我的賀年片，他們大的是恭賀我快樂意思罷。但是我却很不贊成，所以把他們所寄給我的賀年片，原封的寄還了他們；並且我還寫信給他們內容如下：某同學：你所寄給我的賀年片，我已寄還給你們了。我寄還給你們原因有二：一，當今正在國難之期，前方的將士正在浴血抗戰，我們何不把買賀年片的錢節省下來，去買了棉衣捐給前方的將士，增加他們抗戰的精神。二，現在正是節的之期，把這賀年片的錢節省下來，去救我們的難胞，這是我拒收賀年片最大的原因。</p>

<p>寒鴉在天空裏飛，他感覺得到了忍無可忍的境界裏了，他四周充滿了深層的黑暗如幕布似的包裹着他，使他看不到一點兒太陽的光芒，可是他的熱血在每一根血管裹奔騰着，他要求衝出四周包圍着的幕布。</p>
<p>因為，他感覺得時間不等着我們的，我們要與時間親愛，我們乘着靑年的時候，衝向前去，决一個勝負，找一條光明的路。可是他想到這裏，他鼓噪起來，他决然了，就把他的翅膀鼓敲幾下，他把頸項伸得</p>
<p>長長的。他用那很淸朗的聲音喊道，趁熱血未枯盡，鼓淸勇氣，喊一聲奮鬭，努力前進。</p>
<p>但是，他儘着兩翅之力，他不覺得疲倦，他不覺得困難，大家趕快衝出黑暗似的幕布，他又呌喊道，啊，道正是我們的時候！正是我們的時候！</p>

<p>各位小朋友，我來介紹一個小玩意給你們，那個玩意是很簡短的：祇要在晚上先呌你的弟弟和妹妹各坐在一只方桌的四面，在桌子中間放一隻金屬的小盆子，在盆子裏放進食鹽的半匙，再倒半匙酒精下去，而後將電燈熄滅，用火柴燃着小盆子裹的酒精，那時發出來的火光，會使你們各自能看見別人的臉色變爲可怕而異樣了，等到酒精燒完，將電燈開亮，你們的臉色又仍舊復原，這是什麽緣故呢？那完全是化學作用，等你們進中學研究化學的時候，便知道這火焰的原理了。</p>

<p>— 新生</p>
<p>子：奉新年來了！爸爸買一架兎子燈給我玩，好嗎？</p>
<p>父：好孩子，在國難期內，無論買什麼東西，我們都應該從節儉方面着想，這種不必要的玩賞品當然是可以省掉的。倒不如讓我來講些關於兎子的常識給你聽。</p>
<p>子：好的！好的！請您就講吧！</p>
<p>父：兎子，你一定是看見過的，它是屬於嚙齒類的一種小動物，由它們所棲居的環境之不同，可以分爲野兎和家兎兩類。</p>
<p>子：噢！我以前曾在動物園中看到許多雪白的兎兒，非常的可愛，那可不是野兎嗎？</p>
<p>父：現在我開始講兎的種類，你靜靜地聽着罷：</p>
<p>野兎（附圖一）是棲息在林野間的一種兎子，體色茶褐而混有灰色，體長二呎左右耳長三，叫吋；前肢頗短，後肢長的半呎，所以在爬登山丘時，極爲迅速，可是就爲了前短後長，四肢不平均之故，它在下坡時就不十分快了！它在日間隱伏在洞穴或草叢之間，晚上出而覓食樹皮，葉，芽，菜蔬等物，有時爲害於農作物。其肉供食，不甚鮮，毛，皮之用途亦廣。</p>
<p>子：家兎的形狀和野兎差不多嗎？</p>
<p>父：家兎在最初也是由野兎養馴而成的。其頭部及耳朶較野兎爲短，後肢亦不似野兎之長。最最普遍者爲普通家兎（附圖二）此兎各處均有，其形態因產地而稍有變異，據云此兎原產於沿地中海之非洲等處，其耳長，眼爲緋紅色！體色灰，黃，黑，白，褐均有；肉可供食，毛，皮可供作各種材料，人們詞養它除了供食，玩賞之外，亦供醫學上培養病原菌之用。此外有一種安哥拉免（附圖三），是最著名的毛用兎此兎原產於土耳其國安哥拉地方；；體色有褐，白，藍，黑，數種，其毛長的四，五吋，細軟有如絹絲，外觀極爲華麗。供肉用的兎子以佛利蜜許大型種爲最著，體重自十三磅至二十磅！其次爲瑙曼第種，荷蘭種，日本種，比利時種等。比利時種（附圖四）飼育普通，其形極似褐色野兎，體重八磅左右，骨骼細，肉量豐而味頗美，可算是肉用兎之首位；此兎原產於比國體質强健，能適應於各種氣候。英國有一種長耳兎（附圖五）它的耳朶很是長大，耳幅頗廣，起自眼之後方而向下懸垂：體前部稍低，後部高突，靜止時頭部伏下，兩耳垂地，姿態非常的優美；其體色有：黄灰褐等種；價値很昂，這種兎是愛玩用兎類中械著各的一種。至於皮用的兎種，較著者有：力克斯種，海文那種，貂兎靑紫藍兎，銀灰兎，銀狐兎，紫珠兎等。以上數種乃是家兎種類的大概。</p>
<p>子：怎樣兎子的尾巴都是生得很短的？</p>
<p>父：這是爲了它的爬登，奔躍等行動上的便利，尾巴若太長了，對於它那前短後長的四肢就不適應，所以它的尾巴便退化爲很短的一段。在歐洲的東部，南部和亞洲西伯利亞地方，有一種無尾兎（附圖六），它的前肢差不多和後肢一樣長，頭部是　圓形的，耳殼很短，而尾巴極其短小，且不露於體外，所以就有無尾兎之稱。</p>
<p>子：爸爸！你前面說過兎子是嚙齒類的小動物，什麽樣纔呌做嚙齒類呢？</p>
<p>父：噢！原來兎子的門齒，上顎有四隻，中央的兩隻較大，下顎祗生大門齒兩隻，在它咬嚼食物時，上顎作上下動，適於　切，下顎作水平動，適於咀嚼。它的上唇很厚，中有縱裂縫，上達於鼻，這裂縫有把握的功用，能引取食物，送入口中：又使門齒露出，便於磨物。這就是嚙齒類動物特有的一點。</p>
<p>子：兎子除了供我們的玩賞，食用之外，還有別的用途呢？</p>
<p>父：兎毛可以紡成絨綫，又可織成毛織衣料，製成呢帽，兎皮可製手套，耳套，鞋子以及大衣，披肩等服裝之用，用途很廣。所以各國飼育的家兎的有一萬四千三百萬頭之多！</p>
<p>子：爸爸，幾時您去買幾頭兎子，讓我來飼育，好嗎？</p>
<p>父：好的，等你再長大些時，我一定買給你！花。人們每種一决牛痘，要是結果良好的話，可保五年至七年不患天花，不過幼小的孩子，最好每年種一次，稍大以後，大的再種三决，就可保證終身不患天花。種牛痘的好處，在這裹不說也可明曉了。</p>

<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒避　記之九——</p>
<p>在東方剛吐露着魚白色的當兒，那三艘小船便開始咯篤咯篤的，在河的中央像蛇行一樣慢慢的去。遠遠的兩岸，明兒伸長了頭頸，才望見一列矮矮的桑樹和一塊塊的菜地；那桑樹的老葉呈着快要凋零的顏色，這是深秋的標幟，但是那菜葉都碧綠得可愛。</p>
<p>那船已是這樣慢的駛行，可是老天不肯帮忙，陣陣的逆風，向着明兒的臉上撲來，於是那船夫便命他的助手，背着繩，到岸上去背　。那個助手的身子不十分高大，兩隻腿又粗又堅實，胸脯也相當的寬大，顯出一副很强壯的樣兒，只見他撲匈跳到河裏，那河不十分深，河水只及到小腿上，他很快的向前跑去，一面放着繩子，眞好像在春天放紙鳶的動作。等到繩放完了，便背了繩，一步步的踏着很整齊的步伐向前走去。於是那小船是比前快了一些，不過快得是很有限的。</p>
<p>「哥哥，我們到江西耍多少日子？能不能在明天到嗎？明兒覺得那船行得是這樣的慢，他以爲明天到江西還厭它遲了，這話却被他的哥哥，聰明聽得了。</p>
<p>「你說得這麽容易，江西省，離開這裹不知幾千里路，恐怕連乘火車也來不及」。他哥哥這樣的回答他，「江西省是挺大的，那麽我們的目的地是江西的那一個地方？我們生活恐怕也要改變了。」「景德鎭」「景德鎭，這名字是很熟悉的喔，記得了，是一個產瓷器很有名的，那麼我們怎樣到那裹去呢？「你沒有聽到嗎？我們預備先到了杭州，再說，因爲到了杭州，可以乘船或乘火車，可是我聽到他們到了杭州，一方面乘船可比較經濟一些，而乘火車人一定擠得很，我們這麼許多人，是不容擠上的。從杭州乘船而到安徽的屯溪，再從屯溪搭公共汽車而至景德鎭，再乘小船才可到我們的月的地。你想這是多麽麻煩的事，據說到那裹要半月左右哩。」聰兒長長的說了一大篇話，才使明兒明瞭了這次避靴的行程。</p>
<p>他母視正在爲我們的早飯着急，因爲在上船的時候，已是半夜，因此一些兒也沒有買些吃的東西，於是伊老人家便開口向船夫道：「船夫，到那一個小鎭可以上岸去買一些菜。」</p>
<p>那船夫倒很客氣的說「太太。再過去一些路，那鎭上有東西買。」</p>
<p>這時太陽已早從東方升起了，明兒的肚子中餓得咕咕在作響，可是他怎敢發一聲餓的話，因爲大家都沒有東西吃呀！好容易的到了那小鎭。母親便呌船夫去買米和菜了。船夫去了一會，還沒有同來，那眞使明兒難熬了，可是他只好餓在肚裹。他且眼巴巴的望着，望着，那船夫回來了，他心中一喜，那知還要洗米煮菜。在那煮粥的當兒，船艙後一陣子的粥香，使他肚中的餓虫好像要跳出來的樣兒。父等了好一會，粥煮好了，這眞使他更快活得跳起來，他一刻兒吃了三碗，還想冉吃兩碗，可是事實上不許，他又只得耐住了。</p>
<p>明兒的弟妹們因那小船在河中搖搖盪盪，又爲了不常常出門，竟頭暈了，一個個躺在不能稱爲牀的牀上，這引起了母親心中的忐忑不安，常常在向他們：「現在好了一些嗎？」可是他們仍是不聲不響的躺着。這也使明兒不快，因爲在逃難時生病，是最不幸的事。</p>
<p>當明兒剛上船的時候，東望望，西看看，倒也不覺什麽寂寞，後來竟看得有些厭惡了，呆呆的坐在船艙中，只見那太陽從東方漸向西方移動，不一會吃中飯，一刻兒又吃晚飯，很快的過去，可是在晚上的一宿，眞使他苦苦的蜷縮了又長又冷的一夜。</p>

<p>— 秋雯</p>
<p>小朋友讓我來報告一件珍貴的新聞給你們，這是神聖抗戰中底兒童史料。最近全國軍事中心區的重慶全市的小學生們，抱着「讀書不忘救國」的敎訓，組織了一個兒童兵營，凡在九歲以上十五歲以下的小學生，都有自由參加這「兒童兵營」的權利。他們的生活是完全合於軍事敎育化。每一個兒童兵都負起了重大的任務。</p>
<p>他們的組織大槪分為慰勞，運輸，宣傳，和維持交通防空等四大工作。的可分列如下：</p>
<p>（一）慰勞：兒童兵營每日派有若干兒童兵往後方醫院和傷兵醫院去担仟慰勞工作。代將士們寫家信，讀當天報紙的重要新聞，和其他幫助看護們的瑣層工作。</p>
<p>（二）運輸：凡是後方民衆送給將士們的慰勞品兒童兵都有代爲輸送的義務，其他軍事上的運輸比較輕鬆的遇到運輸兵不足時，也須予以帮助。</p>
<p>（三）宣傳：兒童兵營按日派有士兵往附近各鄉鎭作簡明演講，使一般智識比較淺薄的民衆，都能闡明這一决偉大抗戰的意義。</p>
<p>（交通防空）：這是一件最爲重要的工作。就是帮助警察和憲兵等維持交通防空。遇到敵機進襲第一次警報的時候。兒童兵須立刻禁止行人車輛通行，把行人乘客和司機人等很　　鎖　的送到附近房屋或防空壕內去。等到二次警報一響，街人的民衆魷得完全絕跡。吾則被兒實兵營的長官查到，還要受到相當的處罰呢。</p>
<p>從上面看來，可以認識兒童兵們的仟務是那麽煩雜和重大。他們的生活更是那麽的嚴肅和紀律化。對於民衆的接近也非常的親切和藹。他們所穿的服裝，和普通士兵幾乎完全一樣，胸前也佩有符號。所少者槍械而已。</p>
<p>小朋友，重慶的小學生已負起了抗戰期中成人所做的工作。而我們在孤島上的小學生還是很安間地過着生活。這會使我們多少感到慚愧吧！希望小朋友們能趕快實行起「節約儲金」來，貢獻給國家。而負起一部份的小學生的抗戰救國工作來！（譯大美報英文版）</p>
<h3 id="c190">白雪公主　（二） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>這夢想是隨時隨地都可以幹的；即使在洗碗碟擦地板時也可自得其樂的夢想着，並且誰也不能干涉的。所以白雪公主雖是一天天的做着苦工，十分辛苦，而伊的容貌卻一天天的變得美麗起來，這就是得力於夢想而樂觀的原故。伊每决看了自己身上穿着破碎的衣服會夢想着這是用蝴蝶的翅膀所織成的雲錦衣裳，而正在和一位年靑貌美的王子在一塊兒擁抱着跳舞眞的是如漆如膠。伊又夢想着那姻緣美滿的一天，自己和王子結了婚，手携着手的同到那雲端裏的宮殿中去，過那甜甜蜜蜜的生活。</p>
<p>在王宮的園地裏，有一口井，呌做志願井，據說你要是對着這井放聲訴說你的志願時，它會給你如願以償，非常的靈騐。白雪公主便天天到這井邊去，伏在并沿上，訴說伊芳心中的志願，願有一位年靑貌美的王子惠然肯來，把伊救出道痛苦的火坑去，而和伊做一對美滿的夫婦</p>
<p>有一天，有一位年靑貌美的王子，從一個遠遠的王國裹漫遊來此，經過王宮的園地外，司巧聽得了白雪公主的銀鐘似的嬌聲，正在向着井訴說伊的志願。</p>
<p>王子聽了這話，心中一動，突然的出現在王宮的園地裹，引起了白雪公主的注意，兩口兒一見傾心，便彼此相親相愛起來。最不幸的，却被那可惡的王后在窗子裏望見了，眼瞧着王子和白雪公主同在一起，有說有笑的好不快樂，又聽得王子對着公主喚道：「世界中最美麗的女子」。</p>
<p>王后一聽之下臉色立刻變得慘白了，又是生氣，又是嫉妬，把伊那曳地長裙撩在臂間，急忙忙地跑下了七道廊穿過了七扇門，直趕到伊那密室中去，對那魔鏡怒問道：「牆上的仙鏡啊，請你回答我，那一個是世界中最美麗的女子」？</p>
<p>伊說完之後，那魔鏡上就罩上了一重碧綠色的雲霧。這一决，鏡面上張開着一張怪嘴，說出幾句話來，恰是王后所最最怕聽的。伊聽了它說道：「我的王后，今天我髏見了一位容華絕代的小姐，買在要比你美麗得多。伊的嘴唇像玫瑰花那麽紅，伊的皮膚像雪那麼白，伊的頭髮像檀木那麼黑，美啊！美麗極了」。</p>
<p>是啊，這是實在的，白雪公主是世界中最美麗的女子！</p>
<p>王后妬火中燒，那裹容得下一個小小女子竟勝過了伊的美麗；於是伊那刻毒的心中，起了一個刻毒的計劃。伊怒氣勃勃的立時發下命令去，召伊的獵官進宮拜見。獵官不敢怠慢，忙不迭的赶進宮來，拜倒在寳座的脚下，惶恐地問道：「娘娘，有何貴幹使喚小臣」？王后放出冰冷的聲音來，說道：「我命令你明天帶領白雪公主到森林中去。你得獨個兒回來。你明白麼？你得獨個兒回來。幷且你必須好好的幹，不得有誤，回來時須把伊的心裝在匣子裏帶來見我」：說時，取出一個滿嵌珠寶的匣子來遞給獵官。</p>
<p>獵官奉了命令，心坎上好似壓了一塊石頭，放不下去。他想白雪公主溫柔可愛，美麗動人，沒什麼罪過，而王后偏偏容不得伊，發出這惡毒的命令來，硬要自己結果伊的性命，這眞是那裹說起！</p>

Under the leadership of our supreme leader, we have fought on the battlefields for a year and a half, avenging our humiliation and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks.

<h3 id="e15">Public Mobilization in Guerrilla Zones <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Since the War of Resistance entered a new stage, the role of guerrilla warfare has become increasingly important. The Military Affairs Commission issued a general order that "occupied areas" should be uniformly renamed "guerrilla zones," indicating that wherever the Japanese army has set foot, a broad guerrilla war should be launched, which is not only a matter of renaming. Although guerrilla warfare is a military action, it must be coordinated with public mobilization to succeed. The nature of guerrilla warfare is definitely not the "roaming around" plundering like roving bandits as advocated by Wang Jingwei, but a sudden attack that can be launched anytime, anywhere. It is impossible to accomplish this task unless the military and the people are integrated into one. Therefore, the term "coordination" is not enough, it can even be said that the public mobilization in guerrilla zones should be even more important than military action.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's iron hooves can only occupy "points" and "lines," not the entire "area." Everyone understands this. However, in the so-called point and line areas, although the "land" has fallen, the "people" have not fallen. Mechanists will think that there are no "people" at all in the areas that have fallen, because the people have already dispersed before the army retreats, and when the army retreats, the people also go to the rear. What the Japanese army gets is scorched earth and empty cities, with no materials or people. Even if there are some who remain, they are either the old and weak or traitors. But the reality is not entirely so. China, except for a few transportation hubs, is an agricultural society. Not to mention the countryside, even those who live in cities are mostly landlords, small businessmen, and handicraftsmen needed by an agricultural society. The people of an agricultural society are all attached to their land and reluctant to leave their homes easily. Even if they reluctantly abandon their fields and gardens once, they will eventually return home and resume their old business. Looking at the poems and songs of ancient poets, they all lament at the sound of the partridge and miss their hometown when they see the bright moon, and rarely encourage people to travel far. The Japanese army is well aware of this psychology, so after occupying an area, searching, and massacring, they deliberately show small favors and implement "pacification" work, recruiting the public to return to their homeland those who have taken refuge elsewhere, and to return to the cities those who have fled to the countryside. Therefore, in various places in Jiangnan, only three or four months after the fall, 60-70% of the public had returned to their homes. These people were not traitors at first. They were only forced by their livelihood and it was not easy to live abroad, so they had to temporarily return to their homes and live a life of humiliation. The Japanese army thought that this could both embellish and squeeze, so they used traitors to persuade people to resume their businesses, start education, collect rents and taxes, and promote opium and gambling. Knives, swords, poison, all are used together, extracting wealth and anesthetizing them, trying to achieve results beyond guns and bombs. This is also what they call public mobilization. People tend to be greedy for immediate peace and forget long-term considerations. After a long time, impressions are easily erased. The Japanese public mobilization may not be effective now, but if given time, it may be able to cover up the traces of their brutality. Therefore, the current plan is for the Chinese side to strengthen the organization of public mobilization in the occupied areas, educate the public, train the public, explain the great righteousness, and state the advantages and disadvantages, so that they will not be forced by the situation or lured by interests. Then these thousands of people will not be used by the enemy now and will still be national treasures in the future. If the Chinese side relaxes on this, the Japanese side will reduce one obstacle and increase one strength. The stakes are extremely high between gain and loss. Therefore, I believe that even when there is no military action in the guerrilla zone, public mobilization should still be a very important ongoing work.</p>
<p>There are many methods of public mobilization, but they boil down to organization and training. The organizational method should take the form of secret societies. The units should be small, the distribution should be wide, and the political and training personnel of the guerrillas should be responsible for their success. Other organizations such as religious groups and trade guilds should be fully utilized and their effectiveness should be brought into play. In addition to the military training required for guerrilla warfare, the training method should also pay attention to general training. For the sake of popularization and ease of promotion, it is possible to put forward some simple and feasible slogans as creeds to be followed by the general public, such as "Do not pay grain to the puppet organizations," "Do not eat in puppet institutions," "Do not inform," "Do not go to the puppet government to file lawsuits," "Do not send children to puppet schools," "Do not buy and sell enemy goods," "Do not take trains, ships, or cars in guerrilla zones unless necessary," etc. In each small organization, members should swear to these creeds and adhere to them unswervingly. If there are any violations, the small organization will impose sanctions. This matter is very simple and easy. If it can be universally promoted, then the beautiful land will not actually have fallen at all, and what the Japanese army occupies will not even be as good as "points" and "money."</p>

<p>(Chongqing) China's commercial air routes continue to develop and maintain their unique success. Passing through commercial air routes that are indeed war zones is unique in the world, and its airports are targets for enemy air raids. The China National Aviation Corporation, which has a large stake in Pan American Airlines and is operated by American merchants, has reportedly purchased a new-style British-made de Havilland Dragon six-seater passenger plane. The company claims that the newly added plane will fly between Chongqing and Guiyang every Tuesday and Friday starting January 10. According to the company, its planes currently fly to Chengdu every day and return on the same day, fly to Kunming every Sunday and Tuesday, fly to Yichang every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday, fly to Jiading every Wednesday and Sunday, and fly to Guilin every Monday. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation, operated by Germans, also continues to operate in the area. Its planes fly to Kunming every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, fly to Guilin every Sunday and Monday, fly from Kunming to Hanoi every Wednesday and Friday, and fly from Chongqing to Chengdu every Wednesday and Friday. The routes from Chengdu to Xi'an and Lanzhou are only allowed to be flown by Chinese pilots. The planes of both companies are parked at airports within range of Japanese planes, and their pilots stand by their planes. As soon as there is an air raid alarm, they immediately fly the planes away. All planes fly to secret locations, so although the planes are parked in the field, their engines never stop. So far, the only tragic incident has been when a Douglas plane of the China National Aviation Corporation was shot down by a Japanese plane near Guilin. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to estimates released today by the Department of Commerce, US trade with the Far East has declined sharply since 1938. In the first eleven months of last year, US trade with China and Japan decreased by approximately $221,000,000 compared to the same period in 1937. Imports from Japan have decreased from $192,000,000 to $114,000,000, and exports to Japan have decreased from $280,000,000 to $211,000,000. Imports from China have decreased from $98,000,000 to $43,000,000, and exports to China have decreased from $48,000,000 to $31,000,000. Experts here believe that the main reason for the decline in US trade with the Far East is the Sino-Japanese War, as US trade in the Far East was still flourishing before July 1937.

<p>(Tokyo) All newspapers in this city affiliated with the Nichinichi Shimbun carried the first chapter of a lengthy thesis titled "Japan Declares a Century of War" by Lieutenant Colonel Takashima of the Army General Staff, causing great astonishment. It roughly states that the China Incident has reached the stage of a long-term war. We must understand that the significance of East Asian construction and Asian revival lies in creating a new world based on the method of Japan and China to transform the chaotic existing world. The Western powers currently dominating the world have prospered by exploiting Asia, and their ability to dominate the world is based on colonial aggression in the Far East. The resolution of the China Incident will inevitably result in an unprecedented global transformation, and Japan is now concentrating all its efforts on this. Historical evidence suggests that such a great undertaking cannot be achieved without a century of war. Japan has now begun a century of war in order to achieve a global reform according to the method of the Japanese Empire. The various sacrifices that Japan has offered on the altar of peace in China, such as destroying the Chiang Kai-shek regime, building a new China, and reorganizing its military to confront the Soviet Union, are merely useful national efforts to build a new foundation for peace in East Asia. Reading modern Japanese history, Russia is generally regarded as the country with the world's strongest army, but Japan's great victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 completely changed the world's perception, and the international order between Europe and Asia was also shifted. This was the starting point for remaking the world on a new foundation. When the European War broke out, the various weaknesses of Western culture were fully exposed, and Red Russia also emerged as a result. The birth of Manchukuo, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, and the past eighteen months of Japanese military action in China are only steps in the process of transforming East Asia according to the methods of the Japanese Empire. The new political concepts of Germany and Italy are the dawn of hope for the revival of European culture, and the joint anti-communist alliance of Japan, Germany, and Italy will be a powerful impetus for the remaking of the new world. This new political front currently has far-reaching influence throughout the world, such as the Mediterranean, Southeastern Europe, Africa, Southwestern Asia, and South America. The governed peoples continue to be oppressed due to European political disputes and are now gradually calling for liberation. Judging from history and facts, among all the countries in the world, only Japan can save them. The direction that the remaking of the new world will take will be to reform everything using Japanese methods and to understand international affairs with Japanese views. The new history of the world is now gradually unfolding a new and bright page with Japan as its axis. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to the Zheng Wen Daily, "The impact of controlled economy on the Japanese people last year was extremely significant, almost changing the structure of the entire society. Now that the Sino-Japanese War has entered its third year, Japan's economic panic has become increasingly acute. It is reported that the amount of paper money issued by the Japanese government last year reached 1.858 billion yuan, breaking all previous records. The result of this inflation is, of course, rising prices. In order to express their revenge, the Japanese people have transferred all the new Japanese banknotes they have received to purchase Japanese government bonds. As a result, the new banknotes issued by the Japanese government returned to the original treasury in an instant, causing the Ministry of Finance great pain and amusement. As for Japanese prices, the most significant increase has been in retail and wholesale prices, which the government has been trying hard to suppress. The index of price increases is not yet aggressive." (7th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Haiphong: According to the "Post" here, the Bank of Japan specially withdrew 300 million yen from its gold reserves in July last year as a foreign exchange fund. It is now reported that this fund is gradually being exhausted, which has caused great panic in the Japanese government. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, it intensified the control of foreign exchange and issued four measures as follows: (1) Those who apply for foreign exchange must return it to the government within four to six months. The method of repayment is to use the raw materials purchased from foreign countries to manufacture commodities, and after exporting them, return the foreign exchange earned to the government. (2) From this year onwards, no matter who it is, unless they provide a guarantee to the government that the foreign exchange they are applying for is indeed for the purchase of raw materials, and that the commodities manufactured in the future can definitely be exchanged for foreign exchange, they will not be allowed to receive a loan from the foreign exchange fund. (3) International traders who have foreign exchange claims overseas can use them as collateral for applying for foreign exchange. (4) Those who apply to the government for foreign exchange must pay interest, which was previously 1% to 2%, but has been raised to 2.5% or 3% from this year onwards.

<p>(Washington) Regarding the amendment of the current Neutrality Law, well-informed sources here recently stated that the government has decided to go all out to achieve three goals: (1) To clearly distinguish between aggressor nations and aggressed nations; (2) To implement "exclusionism" against aggressor nations, namely, to impose arms embargoes, economic and financial sanctions, and all other means of resistance on aggressor nations; (3) To provide assistance to aggressed nations by all means, but not military assistance. The government's intention is to maintain full freedom of choice within the scope of a general anti-dictatorial policy. It is particularly concerned that Congress may not grant the government the power to act expediently. The government may have no choice but to seek a decision, only requesting the passage of an amendment to completely abolish all provisions of the current Neutrality Law except for the "cash and carry" provision. This move has two benefits: first, US transport ships will not be at risk of being detained or sunk; second, the British and French navies and merchant fleets can dominate the seas and obtain convenience. Conversely, various dictatorial countries may be sealed off. In addition to the benefits, there are also great inconveniences, namely, Japan, which has a strong navy and merchant fleet, can continue to purchase various military supplies from the United States. Therefore, the US government must go all out to negotiate with Congress in order to obtain broader powers to deal with various dictatorial countries. As for the current situation, President Roosevelt could have imposed economic sanctions on countries that discriminate against American commerce in accordance with the tariff law, but the policy that the President intends to promote is extremely broad in scope and would rather wait for Congress to clearly express its wishes before taking any action.

Daladier first expressed his gratitude for the Governor-General's banquet, saying that he was gratified by the Algerine Governor-General Le Beau, the Moroccan Resident-General Rogues, and the Arab leaders' assurance of their loyalty last autumn, which would not change in twenty years. Daladier continued, "If necessary, France will not hesitate to fight for French freedom and world freedom. The blood of French soldiers in the European War was not shed solely for France, but for other allied countries, one of which now seems to have put this fact behind them. In order to seek peace, France has made great sacrifices, and therefore resolutely opposes any attempt, direct or indirect, to destroy the integrity of the French Empire. This determination cannot be broken by any force in the world." After Daladier's speech, the whole hall cheered and stood up together, singing the French national anthem and dispersing.

<p>(London) The British cabinet members' visit to Rome has been modified at the last minute. Political figures are surprised to hear this and say that the authorities of Britain and Italy, originally scheduled to conduct formal talks, now intend to change them to informal talks, without any formal records. Because Prime Minister Mussolini is proficient in English, there is no need for an interpreter. Regarding the content of the talks, according to reliable sources, Prime Minister Mussolini is prepared to order the withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain on the condition that the Nationalist forces in Spain win their attack within the territory of Catalonia. Prime Minister Chamberlain will tell him that the withdrawal of volunteers will enhance the relations between Britain and Italy, and Italy may therefore gain significant economic benefits. In addition, when the British cabinet members leave Paris, they will meet with the French cabinet members, so that the British and French maintain contact. Regarding the dispute between Italy and France, even if Prime Minister Mussolini asks Britain to mediate, he should refuse to do so. As for the request of the Spanish Nationalist forces to enjoy the rights of a belligerent party, Prime Minister Chamberlain is still opposed to it. However, Britain's final position will depend on the development of the Nationalist forces' offensive. So far, although the Nationalist forces have made some progress in Catalonia, the fighting strength of the government army has not been shaken. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Cadogan received French Ambassador Corbin yesterday afternoon and immediately informed him that Prime Minister Chamberlain would always refuse to discuss the issue of French territorial concessions to Italy when talking with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and would not be willing to discuss Italy's other demands in detail. It is reported that Secretary Cadogan decided to explain to Ambassador Corbin that if Prime Minister Mussolini mentioned the issues between France and Italy, Prime Minister Chamberlain would only advise Italy to negotiate with France in a spirit of compromise and would do his best to persuade him to abandon the policy of intimidation. Prime Minister Chamberlain will also personally confirm this to Prime Minister Daladier when he leaves Paris on the 10th of this month. In addition, although the Prime Minister's visit to Paris to talk with the French authorities was caused by a formal invitation from the French government, the general public believes that there is reason to believe that the Prime Minister himself is also happy to do so.

At the same time, Czech forces initiated an encirclement of the city. A Czech colonel and a lieutenant arrived at the city at 3:10 PM. They claimed to be completely unaware of the attack by their own troops, and when questioned why the Czech artillery opened fire during the negotiation period, they offered no explanation, stating only that they had no authority to order a ceasefire. The Hungarian Telegraph Agency later released a message at midnight stating that the Czech shelling of Munkács had not ceased as of 11:15 PM. The Hungarian garrison has orders from above to refrain from retaliating unless directly attacked. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Following the invasion of Hungarian territory by a Czech regular army unit in conjunction with Ukrainian guerrilla forces, semi-official sources here claimed that the Hungarian border guards had defeated them, but the Czech troops had not yet withdrawn from Hungarian territory. A Czech colonel invited Hungarian authorities to negotiate. When the Hungarian plenipotentiary was en route by car, the Czech side opened fire with machine guns, wounding one Hungarian representative in the head. The Czech side then resumed shelling Munkács at 2:00 PM, which continued until dusk. The Hungarian side then dispatched reinforcements. At the same time, the Czech side also gathered forces to reinforce its strength, but failed to cross the Latorica River. As of now, Hungarian troops have captured one Czech tank and one mortar within their own territory, and several Czech regular soldiers have been taken prisoner. They confessed that a company from the 8th Infantry Regiment of their country was ordered to occupy the Hungarian town of Ólosvón. (Has, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Regarding the Munkács incident, semi-official sources here recently stated that after the plenipotentiaries of the Czech and Hungarian sides held a meeting in the city yesterday at 5:30 PM and parted ways, the Czech side continued to shell the city. These sources also believe that Czech troops are currently concentrating on the Hungarian border. (Havas, 7th) Budapest: According to news broadcast here yesterday afternoon, the border conflict between the Czech and Hungarian sides, which occurred yesterday morning due to the Czech army's invasion of Hungarian territory near Munkács, is not comparable to a local incident. According to a news agency, artillery fire continued along the border last night. Official intelligence stated that the Czech army's attack had been repelled, and they fled back into Czech territory, adding that the Hungarian side did not use armored vehicles or artillery during the conflict. It is reported that a Hungarian governor, accompanied by a military officer, was traveling in a car to discuss a solution with two Czech officers when they were shot in the head by machine gun fire. According to Hungarian sources, one Czech tank, one trench mortar, and one machine gun were captured within Hungarian territory. It is reported that Czech artillery continues to shell Munkács. Meanwhile, negotiations to cease the conflict, which were held at the city hall yesterday, have been halted. Currently, one soldier and one child have been wounded by artillery shells.</p>
<p>A communiqué issued from Prague yesterday stated that border clashes had not ceased by 5:00 PM and indicated that this unexpected incident was caused by an unprovoked attack by Hungarian forces on three Czech gendarmes on patrol. After the Czech gendarmes opened fire, the Hungarian army launched a highly organized attack on Czech outposts. According to official sources here, it is noteworthy that the area of ​​the current conflict, Munkács, originally belonged to Ruthenia. After the Munich Agreement, it was arbitrated by Germany and Italy and assigned to Hungary. Although Hungarian sources claimed that there were still conflicts on the border last night, sources in Khust, the capital of Ruthenia, said that no gunfire had been heard on the border since 8:00 PM last night. Yesterday, an official from Bratislava, Czech Republic, told a Reuters reporter that Hungary had violated the border and attacked Czech gendarmes, saying that Hungary had crossed the border near the village of Rosvizkov.

However, the Czech side continues to invade Hungarian territory. The Czech government is fully responsible for all losses of life and property suffered by the Hungarian side as a result of this invasion. The Hungarian government will take preventive measures. According to Hungarian official reports, the Czech Foreign Minister has expressed regret over the matter, saying that he has sent senior staff to Munkács, the scene of the incident, to stop the attack. The two governments have also agreed to send a joint military delegation to Munkács to investigate the facts and determine responsibility. (Haitong, 7th)</p>

Once the issue of responsibility is determined, those responsible will be punished. If these two measures are taken, this incident can be considered over. These sources also said that since this incident was caused by Czech regular army units carrying armored vehicles and machine guns to participate in the fighting, resulting in the deaths of four Hungarian officers and many soldiers, the Czech government should bear the responsibility. Moreover, this action not only violates Hungarian territory but also offends Germany and Italy, as the current border between the Czech Republic and Hungary was demarcated by arbitration by those countries.

<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph quoted an article by Captain Payne as saying that since the Munich Agreement, the activity of German aircraft factories has greatly increased, which proves the accuracy of Hitler's order to the air force to prepare for a spring offensive. Experts from the U.S. Army Air Corps have reported that the output of German military aircraft in November reached an alarming figure of 1,000 aircraft per month. Combining Germany and Italy, their fleet of first-class aircraft in September was six times larger than what Britain and France could muster. The German aircraft manufacturing industry currently employs 400,000 skilled workers, while the British industry employs only 100,000. There is now reason to believe that Germany's efforts in aircraft production in peacetime are close to, if not exceeding, the results achieved by Britain at the end of the European War. Although these estimates are mostly based on speculation, judging from the various information obtained, we can conclude that Germany's current output of first-class aircraft is no less than twice that of Britain. Colonel Lindbergh recently expressed the opinion that British new-style aircraft are superior in efficiency and application to any other country's products in the world. Unfortunately, the production volume of British aircraft has not yet caught up with that of Germany. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>(London) After restricting transactions in foreign currency and gold yesterday, the Bank of England announced today that it has sold gold worth £2,001,571 to the Exchange Equalization Fund. As a result, the price of the pound sterling rose this afternoon (from US$4.6344 at the close of trading yesterday afternoon to US$4.6612 this afternoon). Banking circles here said that the Exchange Equalization Fund held a large amount of gold during the same period last year and had to sell a portion of it to the Bank of England. Now it has bought it back from the bank. From March to September last year, gold exports amounted to no less than £145,000,000. Since September, a large amount of gold has continued to be exported. Officials were concerned about the weakening pound and restricted transactions in gold and foreign currency yesterday. The Bank of England sold gold today to show that Britain has sufficient reserves to effectively intervene in the foreign exchange market, which is commendable. France transferred a large amount of funds to London for safekeeping during the period of European tension, and it is now normal for them to withdraw it. According to precedent, British monetary conditions tend to tighten at this time due to commercial needs. Therefore, there is no reason for the people to be concerned about gold exports.

<p>London: After consultations between the British Treasury and the Bank of England, a record of proceedings was issued in accordance with the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928, proposing to increase the issuance of credit certificates from £230,000,000 to £400,000,000. Officials announced that this increase was related to the transfer of £200,000,000 worth of gold to the Exchange Equalization Fund by the Bank of England's Notes Issue Department on Thursday. The transferred gold is worth a total of £250,000,000 at current prices. According to law, this record of proceedings will be submitted to Parliament for discussion. The government intends to propose legislation when Parliament convenes next session to amend the Currency and Bank Notes Act of 1928. Reuters has learned that the purpose of the transfer of gold from the Bank of England's Notes Issue Department is to increase the Exchange Equalization Fund, so that it has sufficient funds to cope with any changes. The increase of £170,000,000 in the issuance of credit certificates can largely be regarded as a bookkeeping procedure. The gold was sold for £200,000,000, while only £170,000,000 was paid. As a result of the increase in issuance, the Bank of England has restored its position to before December 6 last year, when it temporarily issued an additional £30,000,000 in credit certificates due to the heavy demand for currency during Christmas. According to well-informed sources, what Londoners find different about this move by the authorities is not the nature of the move but its size, as there has recently been a proposal that the Bank of England should transfer £60,000,000 worth of gold to the Exchange Equalization Fund. Since the above news was released, the price of the pound sterling against the US dollar has risen from $4.645 to $4.6737, due to short covering. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French authorities are still discussing ways to assist the British authorities in taking steps to maintain the price of the pound sterling. According to a news release issued by the Economic News Agency today, "We are now instructed to announce that the Bank of France fully agrees to continue to provide effective and reliable assistance to the Bank of England. In addition, major French banks will also strive to provide the London authorities with united cooperation." It is expected that speculation on foreign exchange will be tightened. Since the maintenance of the franc, loans using gold as collateral have not been allowed, and those who want to purchase foreign exchange must first submit commercial documents. However, there are still some who sell francs short to buy US dollars, and although various central banks are working together to curb this, it has not been effective. British commercial banks in Paris have not received any special orders. It seems that there is no need to take any special measures at this time, as the long-term price of the pound sterling is still better than the franc. The price of the pound sterling opened strong today, at 176.97. (Reuters)</p>

<p>Duncan: A Chinese named Hua Xingzhou (transliteration) here has invented a box that can also be used as a lifebuoy. It is said that Hua returned to China several years ago and saw that the life-saving equipment on Chinese ships was very inadequate, so he intended to invent a lifebuoy that was easy to carry. As a result, he succeeded. Hua has now received approval from the American Inventors Association, which believes that his plan can indeed be implemented and has granted him a patent. The structure is roughly as follows: it is usually a box that can hold items, but in an emergency, it can be converted into a lifebuoy. The lid and bottom of the box are both made of cork and other buoyant materials. Hua, who is already a member of the American Inventors Association, came here at the age of ten and has been in business in British Columbia for 30 years. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Situation of the Chinese Army Besieging Zengcheng: Once Charging into the City and Capturing Many, Japanese Army Actively Reinforces, Battle Fierce <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: The Japanese army in the eastern district of Guangdong Province recently, feeling that the area is vast and fearing attacks from Chinese army guerrillas, changed their strategy and reduced their defense zone. Those along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway only firmly defend Dongguan to form a strategic point with Humen and Taiping. The Japanese army near Dongguan uses the Wantai Highway and Wanzhang Highway as strongholds. The Taiping Market, Baisha Market, Xiaoyao, Hetian and other areas outside Humen are also stationed with considerable forces, echoing the Humen Navy. In this situation, the Japanese army has indeed adopted a defensive posture in the eastern part of Guangdong Province. The local defense army, Zhang Ruigui's troops, is currently being reorganized, and the troops that fought near Shian some time ago have been reorganized into the Fourth Route Army Eastern Route Garrison Army, with Zhang Ruigui as the commander-in-chief and Tan Sui as the deputy commander. It governs the ××× Division, Wen Shuhai's troops, and the ××× Division, Huang Tao's troops. In addition to sending Liang Cailin's brigade to join Huang's division to attack Zengcheng, Wen's division is stationed in Huiyang and Boluo, dealing with the aftermath and posting announcements to accommodate scattered soldiers, setting up reception stations in Tiantangwei, Buji and other places. Those who return to the camp with weapons will be rewarded differently. As for the people's self-defense force, its momentum is still huge. Once the Chinese army launches a large-scale counterattack, it will mobilize and cooperate. It is found that the self-defense teams of the Chinese army in Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan and other counties are no less than 200,000 people, all adopting guerrilla tactics. Among them, Yuan Xiajiu's troops are the most powerful. His troops are scattered in Shilong, Chashan, Mashi, Shiwan, Jingshan, Nanbu, Yuetan and other places in Dongguan, constantly posing a threat to the Japanese army in Shilong. Most of the Japanese army in Shilong has moved to Dongguan City. The Japanese army commander, Miyazaki Hisanaga, has set up his headquarters in Minsheng School in Dongguan City. Most of the infantry are stationed in the garden ridge outside the city. The roads near the headquarters, such as Ximenkou and Gaodi Street, are under curfew at night, with small cannons and machine guns erected to cut off pedestrian traffic. Recently, an order was issued to conscript strong men for driving, so most of the residents fled out of the city and would rather join the guerrillas, vowing not to be the running dogs of the Japanese army. The Japanese army, due to the emergency of the Chinese army's counterattack on Zengcheng in recent days, transferred five or six hundred cavalry and hundreds of infantry from Guangzhou to guard the western suburbs of Dongguan City to prevent the Chinese army guerrillas from attacking from Shilong, Sucun and other places. On the other hand, more than a thousand troops were transferred to increase the defense of Taiping Houjie, Shitan, and the main passes of the Wantai Road.</p>
<p>After December 21, there were fierce battles in the suburbs of Zengcheng. Huang's division of the Chinese army marched south from Heyuan in two routes, one approaching the suburbs of Zengcheng and advancing to more than 30 miles outside Zengcheng. At the same time, a part of the ××× Division of the Chinese army also set out from Zijin, joined the Luofu Mountain battlefield, and fought hand-to-hand with the Japanese army. In order to prevent the Chinese army from copying Shitan from Boluo, the Japanese army has destroyed the Sanheshi bridge on the Guangzhou-Zengcheng section of the second main provincial road.</p>
<p>The Chinese army has recovered Futian, Jiu, Tan, Xinzoutang and other key points in the northeast of Zengcheng in continuous attacks, and then occupied Tiechang, which is only fifty or sixty miles away from Zengcheng. The Japanese army here, with more than 2,000 people, occupies the high ground and uses platoon guns to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. The Chinese army can only avoid the real and attack the empty, so that the Japanese army cannot see where the main force of the Chinese army is. The guerrillas once attacked the Japanese camp attached to the city on the evening of the 24th, and gained quite a lot, and then returned to coordinate the regular army to advance according to the opportunity. Currently, the Chinese army is encircling and attacking the eastern suburbs of Zengcheng with a certain two troops, and also telegraphically requested the troops stationed in Conghua in the Beijiang to attack Paitan from the flanks to contain the activities of the Japanese army's left wing. At the same time, another part of the army went out of Futian and attacked Shilong and Shitan along the river. On the 24th and 25th, the Japanese army used special trains to transport a large number of defensive materials to Shitan from Dashatou in Guangzhou to increase the construction of defensive works, and the situation was quite busy.</p>
<p>After the northeastern and northern Chinese armies made contact, they planned to recover Zengcheng first. If they break through it, the Japanese army in Guangzhou will collapse without being attacked. Then, on the 21st, they divided their troops and surrounded Zengcheng. Wen Shuhai's brigade of the Eastern Route Garrison Army advanced eastward from Luofu Mountain in Boluo, and Chen Mianwu's brigade of the Northern Route advanced southward from Taipingchang in Conghua. On the evening of the 22nd, the Eastern Route Army arrived at the eastern suburbs of Zengcheng and engaged in fierce artillery battles with the Japanese army. At 10:00 p.m., the vanguard of the Northern Route Army of the Chinese army rushed into the Shiqiao Zhucun area between the Guangzeng Highway and surrounded the rear of the Japanese army in Zengcheng. When Chen's brigade advanced to Shiqiao, it encountered five or six hundred Japanese troops, and a fierce battle broke out immediately. After an hour of confrontation, the Japanese army fought back in the middle of the night, and was extremely panicked. Then the plateau north of Shiqiao was occupied by the Chinese army, and the Japanese positions were threatened, with hundreds of casualties. The Chinese army's artillery took advantage of the situation to cover the advance of the infantry, and the Japanese army finally collapsed. Shiqiao and Zhucun were successively recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Zengcheng, seeing that the left wing had lost contact, fled from Zengcheng in panic. The vanguard of Chen's brigade once charged into Zengcheng City and captured a large number of Japanese troops and military supplies, as well as several small cannons. That night, the Japanese army withdrew from the city and fled south to Dakeng City. According to reports from the Japanese army in Guangzhou, a large team was immediately sent to reinforce, taking the road to Xintang and out of Dakeng City Yonghe Market to resist stubbornly. The next morning, dozens of planes were sent to assist in the battle. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army moved out of Zengcheng on the morning of the 23rd without any losses. In total, the Japanese army suffered six or seven hundred casualties in this battle, and abandoned supplies all over the ground. After this heavy blow, on the 23rd and 24th, they urgently built fortresses in the eastern and western suburbs of Zengcheng to prevent the Chinese army from attacking again.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Seven Counties in Lixiahe: Accumulated Water Has Not Receded, Will Become a Wetland, Officials and Gentry Gather to Discuss and Appeal for a Quick Blockage of the Breach to Save the Wealthy Area from Becoming Wasteland <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Xinghua Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that the winter season has arrived in the counties east of the canal and south of the river, and the accumulated water has not receded, which will seriously affect the spring plowing next year, specially ordered the seven counties in Lixiahe to gather in Dongtai to discuss methods of dredging the waterways to the sea. Representatives of various counties held a meeting at Honglan Villa in Dongtai at 2:00 p.m. on the 20th. Those present included Ling Huian, chairman of the Yancheng County Chamber of Commerce, Su Zhichen, county magistrate of Dongtai County, Zhang Shouchang, technical director of the Dongtai County Government, Su Zhichen (acting) county magistrate of Gaoyou County, Jiang Guodong, technical director of the Funing County Government, Xu Guanqun, technical director of the Baoying County Government, Gu Zifang, gentry of Xinghua County, Xu Zenghua, technical director of the Xinghua County Government, Zhang Xueqiao, technician of the Taixian County Government, Shen Baozhen, director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, Wang Zizun, chief of the Hebei Canal Engineering Bureau, and Xue Zhankui, inspector of the Hebei Canal Engineering Bureau. Xue Zhankui was publicly elected as chairman, and the following important cases were discussed: The chairman proposed that the accumulated water in the counties east of the canal should be dredged and eliminated. Please discuss the case. Resolution: The affected counties should telegraph the provincial government to submit a request to the central government to find a way to block the breach of the Yellow River in southern Henan to cut off the source. The affected counties should telegraph the provincial government to quickly block the Chexin and Liangba dams in time, and should not adhere to the eight-foot water level precedent of Yumatou to block the dams, which will hinder spring plowing. It was resolved to dredge the following projects: A. Ermaoyou River Tail Levee, 800-zhang diversion river; B. Widen and deepen the opened dams of the Doulonggang Xiaoxiao Gate; C. Wuyougang Xicao Shui River; D. The silting part of the diversion river of Tianfei Zhengyue Two Gates and the reduction river under the Xinhekou Field; E. The unfinished project in the upper reaches of Huangsha Port; F. Other parts of the waterways to the sea that should be dredged will be handled after the Canal Engineering Bureau sends personnel to survey and deliberate. The relevant counties jointly telegraphed the provincial government to urge the Lixiahe Waterway to the Sea Engineering Committee to plan and proceed immediately. The representatives of the counties jointly telegraphed the provincial government to appeal. The telegram reads as follows: "Since the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou Zhaokou, it has diverted into the Huai River and entered Jiangsu, trending east to Hongze Lake, crossing the Canal and directly entering the counties east of the canal. This year, the Huai River has not risen, and the flow of the Yellow River is only a quarter of that in previous years. The counties in Huaiyang have reached a water depth of Xun Zhang on the ground, and the water-receiving area reaches 100,000 square miles. Now that winter has arrived, the water is still overflowing and has not receded. Spring plowing next year is bound to be hopeless. Although there are five ports to the sea, the discharge is limited, and it is impossible to divert the Huai River. It is even more difficult to withstand the exchange of thousands of miles. If the breaches in southern Henan are not promptly blocked, the spring, summer and autumn floods next year will bring down both rivers at the same time, and the counties in Huaiyang will inevitably become lakes forever, and will also invade the Yangtze River and flood Taihu Lake, turning the wealthy area in the southeast into wasteland. The facts are as such, and we dare not deliberately make alarmist statements to sensationalize the public. We respectfully ask you to examine and submit a request to the central government to take advantage of the deep winter water depletion and quickly plan to block the breaches to cut off the source and save the sinking disaster, in the midst of great difficulties. We are extremely anxious and cannot bear to be disturbed. [Signed] Party departments and public groups of Yihua, Yancheng, Dongtai, Funing, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixian, Huaian, Jiangdu and other counties, and all the people."</p>
<h3 id="e51">After the Fall of Guangzhou: What I Saw and Heard on the Guangdong-Guangxi Road (4): Japanese Army Harasses Various Cities and Towns Along the West River, Guangxi Army Moves East to Increase Defense and Consolidate the Chen Line <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>A certain division of the Guangxi army also moved eastward in a steady stream, and set off to Zhao for co-defense. The transport ships and ferries above Zhaoqing to Wuzhou were used to supply military transport, and rarely carried passengers and goods. Only one ship, the Southwest, traveled between Zhao and Wu every other day to maintain the only traffic. A few days later, the Guangxi army arrived in Zhao and completed the deployment. The defense of the upper reaches of the West River was more consolidated than before, and people's hearts were greatly stabilized. Therefore, the shops in Zhaoqing gradually resumed business, but alarms were issued every day, because Japanese planes kept flying in to bomb and harass.</p>
<p>On November 5, I took the Southwest and arrived in Wu from Zhao. Just after mooring at the shore at about 9:00 a.m., I encountered an alarm. Five Japanese planes flew from the lower reaches of Sanshui to attack Wu City, dropping bombs at the Fuhe Triangular Spit, the Sulphuric Acid Factory, Guangxi University, and other places. As soon as the citizens heard the alarm, they all fled to the mountain caves in the northern foothills, Bingjingyong, and Longmu Temple. After the reporter landed, he also followed the citizens to hide. It was found that the air defense room in Wu City was dug into the mountainside, winding and circuitous. Each cave could accommodate fifty or sixty people to more than two hundred people. There were a total of more than four hundred caves in public and private buildings in the city, which could accommodate more than sixty or seventy thousand people. Having such good air defense buildings is rare in the provinces and cities of South China. Is this also due to the natural terrain?</p>
<p>The day after Guangzhou fell, Wu City announced martial law, and many defensive works were added to the main passes. The old, weak, women and children in the city were evacuated, because the refugees entering Guangxi from Guangdong were extremely crowded. In order to facilitate the entry of refugees, the authorities temporarily exempted ships from entry inspection, but hotels and hotels still carried out inspections. When a traveler arrives in Wu, if he is staying in a hotel, he is only allowed to stay for three days. If he exceeds the time limit, he must find a local store or a relative or friend with a job to guarantee him. The intention is probably to prevent spies. Although the population of Wu City was ordered to be evacuated, the number increased day by day, because those who fled from western Guangdong all took Wu City as a gathering point. Business was quite calm in the morning, but as prosperous as usual in the afternoon and evening, because they had to avoid the Japanese planes in the morning. The import goods such as kerosene, cotton yarn, matches, woollen cloth, cloth, cotton and wool ornaments, cigarettes, foreign wax flour, etc. were one to two times more expensive than before the fall of Guangzhou. The local products of the province, such as grain, rice, pigs, chickens, ducks, cattle, etc., were particularly cheap. The top rice was only sold for more than five to six yuan per hundred catties, pigs were sold for fourteen or five yuan per hundred catties, and chickens were sold for two corners and five cents per catty, because the downstream traffic was blocked, and the supply of local products exceeded the demand, so the import goods were expensive and the export goods were cheap. However, the farmers' economy was greatly affected. As for the intra-provincial traffic, such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Longzhou, Baise, etc., although the military transport was busy, the ferries were not blocked. Although the inter-provincial transport was greatly affected, it was still possible to pass through Longzhou to Vietnam, Yongning to Beihai, and Yulin to Guangzhou Bay, but the long-distance detour and freight were uneconomical. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Guangxi Province was under serious threat, and the responsibility it bore for the war of resistance was even heavier. In early November, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai rushed to Guilin from the northern front to convene commanders of various routes and senior generals to receive instructions in person. At the same time, the military and political affairs of the province were also reorganized. Precise arrangements were made for where to station heavy troops, which counties to designate as garrison areas, who to command which routes, and the allocation of guerrillas in each county, the transfer of vehicles, and the raising of supplies and equipment. At the same time, in terms of politics, preparations were made to implement the popular election of county magistrates in all counties of the province in January of the 28th year. Before the popular election, starting from November of this year (the 27th year), all county magistrates in counties close to the Guangdong border and adjacent to the war zone were assigned to people from the original籍of each county, such as Huaiji, Cangwu, Cenxi, Rongxian, Guilin, and Tengxian. The county council was also established at the end of this year. The heads of districts, townships, towns, villages, and streets in each county were all elected by the local people to implement the county autonomy system. The families of runaway conscripts who were detained in various counties in the past were all released from December 1. Because the situation was critical to the extreme, the authorities hoped that the army and the people would unite to save the country, so both the military and political aspects were reformed.

<h3 id="e52">Japanese Army in Yongxiu Closes Doors and Defends to the Death: Japanese Plane Drops Communication Bag and Mistakenly Falls into Chinese Army Position, Firmly Instructing Not to Challenge, Nanchang-Jiujiang Line Only Barely Maintained <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Gongdu Dispatch: On the Xiu River front, the Chinese and Japanese armies are facing each other across the river, and have become deadlocked. The activity of the Chinese army guerrillas on the north bank makes the Japanese army worry about being surrounded and annihilated from time to time. Therefore, the Yongxiu city gate is closed all day long, leaving only the north gate for entry and exit. Fortifications are built near the outside of the city, and barbed wire is erected. At 9:00 a.m. on the 16th of last month, a Japanese plane flew over the north bank of the Xiu River and dropped a communication bag. When it was flying low over Yongxiu to drop it, due to the wind direction turning south, one of the communication bags mistakenly fell into the Chinese army's position. The following is an excerpt from the content of the letter published by the Chinese side: "Major Yamamoto's troops must now defend Yongxiu to the death. Baicha is in an unfavorable position, and there is a danger of being surrounded and attacked by the enemy (referring to the Chinese army, the same below). It should be withdrawn to Qiujin immediately. The fortifications on the north bank of the Xiu River should be located seven li away from the river surface. If there is no artillery, heavy machine guns can be used instead. The troops stationed in Jiujiang are successively concentrating towards Hankou. If the enemy does not attack, do not challenge under any circumstances, and try to avoid enemy artillery and enemy aircraft bombing as much as possible. The attacking target of our army (referring to the Japanese army) has now shifted to ×× and ××. On the Nanchang-Jiujiang line, we can only adopt a defensive posture."</p>
<h3 id="e53">New Fourth Route Army: Divided into Political and Military Systems, Political System is the Lifeline of the Army <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Continued dispatch from American Evening News Special Correspondent Belden: The main difference between the New Fourth Route Army I saw and other armies is not that they are braver in combat, nor that they live harder, but that their political department occupies an important position in combat. The political system is the lifeline of the army. Each team has a political instructor who leads the combat. He is in the front when attacking and in the rear when retreating. He must also scout the enemy's阵, encourage the soldiers, and be an example for every combatant. Therefore, the casualties of political workers are also high. The New Fourth Route Army can be divided into political and military systems. The chief of staff and headquarters on the military side, and the political instructors, etc., are all commanded by the chief and deputy commanders. Broadly speaking, the work of the political department is divided into two categories, namely, teaching and reading theories of resistance and history, etc., and the other is to ensure the success of the orders issued by the commander. According to the leaders of the army, the most important purpose of political work is to ensure the victory of the war of resistance. After investigation by the reporter, I am deeply convinced of their words. The combatants of the army are all volunteers, two-thirds of whom come from the southern provinces. Most of them are guerrillas of the old Red Army, so political work is easier to carry out. However, there are also several weaknesses, such as the dispersed and vast military strength, and the inability to obtain contact with each other. The political department strengthens the army's strength through political methods, first increasing the political education of the soldiers, explaining why China is fighting, and telling every combatant why China must win. The political department also follows the tradition of the old Red Army, such as new soldiers fighting with old fighters in difficult conditions, living in difficulties, and inheriting the Red Army's spirit of loving the people and self-sacrifice. The New Fourth Route Army strictly prevents spies and traitors. The political instructors all know where their soldiers come from, their abilities and their intentions, so no traitors have ever been found in the army. When the Fourth Route Army initially decided to assemble in southern Anhui, because the Japanese army had superior aircraft, the political instructors painstakingly explained to the soldiers not to fear the enemy or underestimate the enemy. Recently, it was discovered that officers and soldiers were wasting money and paper, so an economic movement has been started, and meetings have been convened. The officers explained in detail the importance of economy, saying that there is little money in the army. If materials and money are wasted, they will not be able to purchase the required items, thus affecting the combat strength. Therefore, the officers and soldiers began to save money automatically. Recently, the New Fourth Route Army has launched a strong united front movement in the army through lectures in classrooms, slogans, newspaper propaganda, pasting posters, and singing songs. The army leaders believe that this can strengthen combat effectiveness. The soldiers of the New Fourth Route Army are not limited to any belief in the main attack. Members of the Kuomintang and fallen bourgeois are also fighting in the army, because in the war of resistance, it does not matter whether they believe in communism or the Three People's Principles. According to Deputy Commander Xiang Ying, we will accept them regardless of their political beliefs, but we will carry out political work in accordance with the principles of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Changzhou Rice Merchants: Oppose Harsh Taxes, Puppet Organization Also Plunders <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Changzhou Dispatch: Since Changzhou was occupied, the prosperous areas have been destroyed by fire. The current market is in the Ximen area, barely serving as a decoration. Recently, the puppet business tax bureau ordered rice merchants to increase the surtax on each stone, which was strongly opposed by grain merchants. Because the Mishiwan outside Ximen has long lost the focus of the rice market due to river traffic relations in recent years, the resumption of business after the disaster, most of the goods on the market are for the relief of the people's food. In addition, the disaster has been severe, and the people's livelihood has not been restored. The grain business has been reduced to zero, and the main business is that when a whole batch of goods arrives, it is taxed and sold by a commercial firm, and then distributed by various shops. At present, the business focuses on the circulation of the people's food. The most difficult thing is that when the taxed grain is transported and unloaded, the puppet inspectors check it up and down, causing trouble and delay. Because the grain is trivial and the procedures are complicated, it is by no means possible to save the poor and supplement the deviations with all the separate transport documents. Grain concerns the lives of the people, and Wujin has suffered more severely than other counties. At present, the rice market is barely focusing on circulation, and there are no large-scale transactions. More than 20 grain merchants have specially elected representatives such as Qian Renchang to request the reduction or exemption of surtaxes from Wang Zhongping, director of the puppet provincial business tax office.</p>

<p>Taixing Dispatch: Since the full-scale war of resistance, the districts of the county under the jurisdiction of the river, 1, 6, 7, and 8, have been burned and plundered repeatedly due to the passage of Japanese warships. The tragedy of the war has been unbearable to witness. In the past two years, the river water has risen sharply and the discharge has been unsmooth. In addition, the Yellow River has diverted and overflowed, causing disasters. Last autumn, a hurricane passed through the territory, and the harvest was barren, which further affected the livelihood of farmers. At present, there are still places in the flooded farmland that Zhu can cultivate in spring. Natural and man-made disasters have occurred frequently. Now that the severe winter has arrived, they are starving and freezing, waiting to be fed. According to the survey, there are more than 5,000 households waiting for relief. However, because the county is small and the local finances have been exhausted after the disaster, it is unable to save itself. At present, the public groups in the county are calling for help from outside, and they hope that international charity groups and overseas gentry will assist in providing relief.</p>

<p>Jiaxing Dispatch: In order to buy up foreign exchange and carry out economic aggression, the Japanese side has recently set up shops in He to specialize in collecting Chinese silver and legal tender, as well as valuable securities, with military tickets and Japanese tickets. It has been a month, so that the legal tender in He is rarely circulated in the market. Moreover, some good merchants, seeing that it is easy to make profits by engaging in this business, actually disregard righteousness and rush to open shops under the pretext of collecting Chinese torn banknotes, specializing in buying them up, and hiring unemployed people to go to the towns and villages near the city to collect them in large quantities. It is learned that the well-known shops in He that specialize in buying up for the Japanese side are Dali and other families at No. 33 Beida Street. The Chinese authorities have learned of this matter and have specially ordered restrictions on pedestrians carrying legal tender in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Jiashan Dispatch: The county magistrate of Jiashan has been appointed by the provincial government to be Wu Cixian. Wu has started to handle the Baojia system and organize the district and town offices. The Chinese army stationed in Jiashan is the ×× Brigade, which has completely destroyed all the bridge wedges and culverts on the Hangshan Highway. The Japanese cannot build them. The only places where the Japanese army's power can reach are the dead city of Jiashan and the transportation strongholds along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. Recently, the ×× Brigade, in view of the fact that there are many bandits impersonating guerrillas in the four townships, disturbing the people, has sent teams to search for bandit traces in recent days, and has successively captured Jin Maomao, the bandit leader from outside Xidou Shao, Yu Bianxi, who was rampant in the Dingzha area, and Chen Binkui and Yang Misheng, who were entrenched in Xitang Ganyao. The troops of Yang Changchi of the Dayun Temple guerrilla team were also disbanded. Jin Maomao and the other four were successively executed by shooting. Bandits were also captured everywhere and buried alive, no less than fifty or sixty people. Since then, the bandit atmosphere has greatly subsided.

<p>— Jin Zhixuan</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life, and none can be separated from fuel. In clothing, the spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing of cotton, hemp, silk, and wool all require the power and heat of fuel to complete the work. As for food and fuel, they have had a close relationship since the invention of drilling wood to make fire. The materials for building houses, and the heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, hygiene, and fire prevention in daily life, also cannot do without fuel. After the advancement of transportation tools, all ships, trains, airplanes, cars, etc., cannot do without fuel. Therefore, its importance is no less than that of food. Studying fuel should be an urgent matter. People living in Shanghai should especially know the general situation of Shanghai's fuel supply. What is described in this article must have omissions, but it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Any substance that can burn and generate heat, without the danger of explosion during combustion, and without the risk of economic miscalculation, can be called fuel.</p>
<p>Belonging to solids and easily melted solids:</p>
<p>Coal: Bituminous coal, anthracite coal, lignite coal, coal briquettes, and coke (minerals)</p>
<p>Charcoal: Various types of soft and hard charcoal and charcoal briquettes (plants)</p>
<p>Firewood: Firewood, wood chips, straw, etc. (plants)</p>
<p>Seed fillings: Cottonseed hulls, bran, bean pods, peanut shells (plants), etc.</p>
<p>Mineral hardened wax: Paraffin wax, etc. (minerals)</p>
<p>Plant hardened wax: Asphalt, etc. (plants)</p>
<p>Animal hardened wax: Congealed fat from fish and beasts</p>
<p>Belonging to liquids: Mineral oil: Gasoline, kerosene, diesel (minerals)</p>
<p>Vegetable oil: Rapeseed oil, green oil, etc. (plants)</p>
<p>Alcohol: Made from grains, plant roots, wood, etc. (plants)</p>
<p>Belonging to gases: (Heating solids or liquids to gasify is not included)</p>
<p>Mineral gas: Fire well marsh gas, etc., carbon-light compound gas (minerals)</p>
<p>Artificial chemical gas: Made by compounding or analyzing methods (not limited)</p>
<p>Animal skin and bone biogas: Garbage gas, lamp gas, etc., artificially manufactured (animals)</p>
<p>(1) Coal</p>
<p>Although there are many types of fuel as mentioned above, coal accounts for the main part of fuel. In advanced countries around the world, each person needs an average of four tons of coal per year. Now, the sources, quantity, and distribution of coal used in Shanghai are summarized below:</p>
<p>Coal is divided into three major categories: bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and lignite coal. The total amount of coal consumed in Shanghai each year, based on statistics from 1933 to 1937, is 3.25 million metric tons, averaging less than one ton (0.91 tons) per person per year. Among them, 11.5% is anthracite coal, 1.5% is lignite coal, and the remaining 87% is bituminous coal. For clarity, bituminous coal, anthracite coal, and lignite coal are described separately below:</p>
<p>The sources of bituminous coal are divided into domestic coal and imported foreign coal. Due to the location of production and transportation, domestic coal is divided into five major routes: Kailuan, Shandong, Pukou, Yangtze River, and North China.</p>
<p>Kailuan: The Kailuan and Australian mining areas are in Hebei Province, a Sino-British joint venture, also known as domestic coal.</p>
<p>Shandong: Coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway, with a small amount going to Jinan, and most exported from Qingdao.</p>
<p>Most of the Shandong coal in Shanghai comes from Qingdao, also known as Qingdao coal, such as Yuesheng, Boshan, Hongshan, Taishan, etc. Some of them are also Sino-Japanese joint ventures, collectively referred to as domestic coal.</p>
<p>Pukou: Bituminous coal produced along the Jinpu Railway in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui provinces, with Pukou as the export concentration area, transported to Shanghai, such as Zhongxing, Huadong, part of Shandong, Jingxing, etc. Coal exported from Haizhou to Shanghai is also included in this category.</p>
<p>Yangtze River: Various mines that transport coal to Shanghai along the Yangtze River, such as Huainan, Datong, Liuhegou, etc., are collectively referred to as Yangtze River coal. Huishan and Changxing also belong to this category.</p>
<p>North China: In addition to Kailuan, Shandong, etc., which form their own category, coal from various mines in Hebei, Shanxi, and those close to Shanhaiguan, such as Datong, Shanxi, Doutougou, Beipiao, etc., are transported to Shanghai by sea from Qinhuangdao or Tanggu, collectively referred to as North China.</p>
<p>Among the foreign coal imported in Shanghai, Japanese coal is the most common, including those from Japan proper, Korea, Taiwan, and the Kwantung Leased Territory—such as Fushun—all transported by ship. In addition, those from India, Annam, the Dutch East Indies, and Australia or other countries are also transported to Shanghai by ship.</p>
<p>Of the 2.83 million tons of bituminous coal consumed in Shanghai each year, the distribution of the above-mentioned sources is as follows:</p>
<p>The current situation is very different from the past. According to the reporter's estimation, the total amount of imported bituminous coal for the whole year of 1938 was 400,000 tons, of which 70,000 tons were Japanese coal, and the rest came from British and Dutch colonies and other countries. The amount of Kailuan and Australian coal arriving in Shanghai was 950,000 tons. As for the actual consumption, it is difficult to determine, because there may be coal stored and transported in various places, but at most it is only 50,000 tons. Therefore, the total consumption of bituminous coal for the whole year of 1938 was 1.4 million tons, which is half of the previous year's amount. From this, it can be seen that the coal consumption of factories throughout Shanghai, directly and indirectly, is 1.45 million tons per year. The sources of anthracite coal are also divided into domestic coal and imported coal. Domestic coal is divided into three types: Qinhuangdao, Henan, and Shanxi.</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao: The Liujiang, Great Wall, Taiji and other mining areas are mostly in the occupied areas, with Qinhuangdao as the concentration area for export to Shanghai. Although there were Sino-Japanese joint ventures before the September 18th Incident, they were all taken over by the Japanese after the September 18th Incident, but they are still regarded as domestic coal.</p>
<p>Henan: The most famous anthracite coal in Henan is the anthracite coal from the Fuzhong Company. In addition, there are many small mines, all with Hankou as the concentrated export area. Some are transferred from Zhengzhou via the Longhai Railway and come to Shanghai via Pukou.</p>
<p>Shanxi: Anthracite coal produced in northern Shanxi Province is mostly loaded onto the PingSui Railway in Datong and shipped from Tanggu to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Among foreign anthracite coal, that from Annam is the most common, and Hongji is the most famous. Marke, etc., are also sold on the market, transported by sea from Haiphong to Shanghai. In the past, anthracite coal has gradually replaced charcoal, and its consumption has increased. Since the issuance of coal briquettes, the sales of anthracite coal fines have greatly increased. After the routes from Liujiang, Shanxi, and Henan were blocked, anthracite coal from other mines in Annam, such as "Dong Tuo Li," etc., also came to Shanghai in large quantities.</p>
<p>Of the 373,000 tons of anthracite coal used in Shanghai each year, the distribution according to the source is as follows:</p>
<p>Summer 1933 to Summer 1935     Current Situation</p>
<p>The use of anthracite coal is mostly limited to heating in winter, making daily-use coal briquettes, and for use in restaurants, confectionery shops, and cake shops. Therefore, its consumption does not decrease due to the war, and still maintains the statistical figure of one-tenth of a ton per person per year. However, domestic coal is reduced, and replaced by imported anthracite coal.</p>
<p>The sources of lignite coal are limited to domestic sources, mostly from Pukou and the Yangtze River. Pukou coal includes part of Lieshan (Yili), and Yangtze River coal is mostly produced in Huangshi Port, such as Fuhua and Lihua mines. The average annual sales in Shanghai are 47,000 tons. Except for a small part used in restaurants and food shops, and for making earthen coal balls, most of it is used for making "Jue Deng" and other coal briquettes. Since the Yangtze River was blocked, the supply has been cut off, and it is currently replaced by anthracite coal fines. Coal briquettes are made of anthracite coal fines and lignite coal fines from various places, which on average contain more than 15% clay or other adhesive substances. From a scientific point of view, the quality of coal briquettes depends on anthracite coal. However, due to the addition of soil during artificial manufacturing, it is suitable for use on earthen stoves and is easy to ignite. There are thirty or forty coal briquette factories of various sizes in Shanghai, producing 600 tons of coal briquettes per day, totaling about 200,000 tons per year. Since coal briquettes are made of anthracite coal fines, the coal poisoning from their combustion is no different from that of anthracite coal. It is absolutely forbidden to burn coal briquettes indoors for heating in huts without chimneys.</p>
<p>Coke is also a type of coal, which is as flammable as charcoal. It has smoke when it first burns, and no smoke after it is completely red. In the autocratic era, it was exclusively used for palace fire basins. It is produced in northern Shanxi and is very expensive. Three or four years ago, when the price of anthracite coal in Tianjin was ten yuan per ton, the price of coke was forty-five yuan per ton.</p>
<p>Coke is made by calcining bituminous coal fines. On average, 100 tons of coal fines can yield 60 tons of coke. Before the war, Shanghai consumed 2,000 tons of coke per month, of which 500 to 600 tons were shipped to Hangzhou and Wuxi. The most suitable coal for coking is Kailuan, Zhongxing, Jingxing, and Liuhegou coal. Japanese coal is not suitable for coking, so Japan imports mostly coking coal each year. Coke is used in iron casting and steelmaking plants. Some coke is directly transported from the mines to Shanghai, but two-thirds are made from coal fines locally. Therefore, the amount of coke is mostly already included in the above-mentioned annual coal consumption. Even if there are slight discrepancies, the number is extremely small. In the past, the market price was below 30 yuan per ton. This year, the price is close to 200 yuan. It is currently rumored that Kailuan and Australian coal are being tested for coking in Shanghai, and the price may be slightly lower.</p>
<p>The distribution of the 3.25 million tons of coal used annually in Shanghai before the war is as follows:</p>
<p>The value of coal has always been calculated by the ton. The average value of major bituminous coal over five years is listed below:</p>
<p>Coal Name   Average Wharf Delivery Price per Ton over Five Years (in National Currency)</p>
<p>Kailuan      12.00</p>
<p>Zhongxing    14.00</p>
<p>Datong       12.25</p>
<p>Shandong     11.50</p>
<p>Huainan      11.75</p>
<p>Fushun       17.25</p>
<p>The current prices vary greatly. Kailuan is still sold at 26 yuan delivered, while Indian coal ranges from 38 yuan to 45 yuan. Even Japanese coal is at least around 35 yuan. It is feared that there is no hope for lower coal prices in the short term, but due to the manipulation of powerful coal merchants, a fluctuation of three or four yuan per ton is unavoidable. If the exchange rate changes, and the source of Kailuan and Australian coal cannot maintain the current proportion, then the rise in coal prices should be expected.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Association Hometown Association Fundraising Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3 PM yesterday. The meeting passed the organizational charter and fundraising methods, and resolved to promote piggy bank disaster relief and theatrical fundraising. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting yesterday was attended by Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing, Xu Ji, Secretary-General Yuan Ludeng, Fundraising Directors Fang Jiaobo, Lin Kanghou, Director Jiang Yiping, representatives of various hometown associations Ningbo Le Rucheng, Dong Xinqin, Qin Runqing, Jin Zongcheng, Huining Zhang Yiqi, Cao Zhigong, Wang Yisan, Xiuning Dai Binnan, Wu Mingxin, Taixian Song Shixiang, Wenzhou Lin Daji, Hu Xiru, Xunshe Zhan Ziyang, Zhu Chaoran, Anhui Xu Xiaochu, Hong Juehe, Shangyu Wang Hesong, He Wuliang, Xianju Wang Jingdong, Nantong Ge Futian, Rugao Chen Weifan, Chaozhou Chen Zimi, Zhang Kanglong, Kunshan Tao Leqin, Shandong Jing Yaosan, Shaoxing Pei Yunxiang, Hushe Tang Chongshi, Jixi Cheng Kefan, Baoshan Yu Yaoqiu, Yinxiang Xing Guxiang, Pudong Pan Zhiwen, Lu Wenshao, Changzhou Hu Shouqi, Wang Yunfeng, Xu Guanqun, Zhenjiang Chen Peide, Fan Guoren, Jin Xiaodong, Hebei Chen Zhongru, Wujiang Zhou Xinmei, Cai Yuanzhan, Zhenhai Liu Zhongying, Jiading Chen Jicheng, Zhang Tianbai, Sichuan Li Qingfan, Suzhou Ge Shouyi, Dinghai Chen Yiting, Taizhou Yan Nianshan, and the presidium Wu Yunzhai, Pei Yunxiang, Xu Xiaochu, Lu Wenshao, Cao Zhigong.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Xu Xiaochu delivered the opening speech, saying: "Today, the Hometown Association Fundraising Committee is holding its inaugural meeting. We are deeply honored to have the leaders of the association present to guide us. Since the August 13th Incident in this city, an extremely serious relief problem has arisen. At that time, no less than hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to Shanghai from the war zones, and were accommodated in reception centers. At the peak, there were more than 300,000 people. After efforts were made to evacuate them, the number gradually decreased. However, the 100,000 refugees currently remaining in Shanghai are mostly homeless and impoverished, and urgently need relief. Now that the association has been established, the relief measures are becoming more and more complete, which is truly good news for the refugees. Taking the Ningbo hometown association as an example, there are no less than one million people engaged in business in this city. Considering all the refugees in Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai should take the responsibility of providing relief. We, the people of various hometowns, should immediately do our best to promote fundraising work to assist the association in handling relief affairs. It is our inescapable duty. Moreover, the fathers in various reception centers are all disaster-stricken fellow villagers from various places. Although the establishment of our fundraising committee is perhaps a little late in terms of timing, doing one more point of effort will always yield one more point of effect."</p>
<p>Association Guidance</p>
<p>Refugee Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing said: "In addition to providing rations, the association's work has now begun to handle refugee factories, hospitals, education, and other matters. Preparations are also being made for the future repatriation of refugees. The central government is extremely concerned about the refugees in Shanghai. Currently, the refugee's winter clothing can still be dealt with through donations from all walks of life, but there is an extreme lack of quilts." Yuan Ludeng said: "Since the establishment of the association, it has been unanimously supported by various industries, groups, and people from all walks of life. Now that the hometown associations have risen up again to make universal promotions, they will definitely be able to achieve the goal of 'everyone knowing and everyone working together.'" Fang Jiaobo said: "The establishment of the Hometown Association Fundraising Committee will reduce the difficulties of various hometown associations in conducting individual fundraising by coordinating and managing hometown fundraising. It is expected that after today's meeting, actions will be taken separately according to the resolutions, and satisfactory results will surely be obtained."</p>

<p>Since the Japanese and puppet regimes have been sheltering and allowing local gangsters and ruffians to open gambling tables and opium dens in the areas outside the boundaries of the Western Shanghai roads, bandits have been lurking, robberies have occurred from time to time, and the nearby residents have felt uneasy. Recently, the bandits have intensified their actions, daring to cross the border to rob concession police of their firearms and attack police officers, which has seriously affected the security of the concession. In order to maintain order within the boundary and ensure local peace, the police authorities had no choice but to take strict measures. Since last month, they have implemented a blockade at the main entrances and exits of the roads outside the boundary, piled up barbed wire and other obstacles to block traffic, and dispatched armed police to patrol day and night. The situation is extremely tense. Since the adoption of these measures, concession residents who want to go to gambling dens have found it extremely inconvenient to enter and exit, and there are many dangers as bandits run rampant around the gambling dens. Therefore, many people have hesitated to go forward. In recent days, most of the gambling tables have been deserted, and business has become increasingly sluggish. Although there are still sounds of gambling and drinking, most of them are employees in the gambling dens, who gamble with each other in their boredom for a bit of entertainment. It is said that the owners of the gambling tables are all frustrated. Many, such as Lishang Company and others, have already announced their closure because they cannot maintain operations.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, Japanese sources reported today (7th) that Japanese troops in Hangzhou had planned to immerse themselves in the festive atmosphere on New Year's Day, but this atmosphere was dispelled by the attack of Chinese troops and guerrilla squads. The main force of the 63rd Division of the Chinese Army crossed the Qiantang River near Liangjiaqiao (transliteration), 15 kilometers southwest of Hangzhou. Another unit landed at Zhoujia (transliteration) between Hangzhou and Fuyang. The two armies then converged in one place. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese Army attacked Hangzhou directly from the southwest and engaged in fierce fighting west of Hangzhou. The Japanese side also dispatched several bombers to reinforce the ground troops. The headquarters of the 63rd Division of the Chinese Army is located in Shaoxing. Another unit of the army landed at Haiyan on the north bank of Hangzhou Bay in the early morning of New Year's Day, and pressed towards Hangzhou from the west, engaging the Yamada Detachment of the Japanese Army. The next day, another 8,000 Chinese troops, including 6,000 suicide commandos, also advanced towards Hangzhou from the north and are still fighting with the Japanese army north of Hangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e64">To Maintain Foreign Trade Position, Exert Efforts to Encourage Export of Domestic Goods, Exempt Transit and Export Taxes, and Provide Full Transportation Facilities <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission made efforts to adjust the market prices of domestic goods to promote exports, goods that should be settled in foreign exchange are allowed to be exported tax-free. At this time of the War of Resistance, in order to maintain the foreign trade position of major domestic goods, all efforts are being made to handle the tung oil, silk, and tea industries, so that production increases and sales abroad are smooth. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Encourage Exports</p>
<p>The Trade Commission has the following measures:  For export goods that have been proven to be sold abroad, the premiums for war risk insurance insured with the Central Trust Bureau are specially allowed to be recorded on account. If the goods are sold at a loss, the premiums will be exempted.  When export goods are transshipped, if the foreign sales are guaranteed, the transshipment tax will be exempted according to regulations, and there is no need to go through the procedures of collecting first and then refunding.  Goods for export that should be settled in foreign exchange are exempt from export tax.  The competent authorities provide full facilities for the transportation of export goods.  When the cost of export goods is lower than the market price abroad, the purchase price of the origin and distribution market of the goods may be determined according to the market price abroad. The association and merchants will purchase as much as possible. When the cost of export goods is higher than the market price abroad, the purchase price of the origin and distribution market may be determined according to the production cost of the goods. If the merchant is unwilling to purchase due to the high price, the association will purchase and trade as much as possible according to the price.</p>
<p>Major Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Major domestic goods exports last year:  Tung oil: 680,567 quintals, valued at 38,222,582 yuan  Silk: 5,178,831 kilograms, valued at 33,877,696 yuan  Tea: 384,024 quintals, valued at 30,354,276 yuan  Pig bristles: 33,438 quintals, valued at 25,535,175 yuan  Cotton: 1,295,561 quintals, valued at 95,162,235 yuan  Wool: 4,152,363 kilograms, valued at 9,657,984 yuan. The above figures are converted into legal tender based on the statutory price of customs gold. Compared with the previous year, except for the increase in cotton, the rest have decreased, but the decrease is not very large.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Japanese Army Building Airfield in Datong, Plans to Control Sand and Gravel Due to Lack of Piping Materials <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Express News Agency Local Dispatch: To defend Shanghai, an important military base in central China, the Japanese army is now constructing fortifications on a large scale in the urban area and surrounding suburbs of Shanghai. They are also using Chinese people for forced labor and controlling sand and gravel as building materials. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Building a Large Airfield and Constructing Military Roads</p>
<p>Near Datong, the Japanese army is currently enclosing thousands of acres of land to build a military airfield of the largest scale in central China, to serve as an air force base for the war of aggression against China. At the same time, a military highway is being newly built from Zhabei to Yanglinkou. According to Japanese sources, this project is contracted by a Chinese man named Chen, in collusion with a Japanese named Iwakawa Hidezuru. Work was supposed to start earlier, but it has been delayed until now due to a shortage of building materials and is still not completed. The Lack of Materials and Control of Sand and Gravel</p>
<p>The most important material for this military construction is sand and gravel, so the Japanese side is attempting to control it. The Japanese side was advised by Chen and Yuan, scum of the sand industry, to invest 500,000 to organize a sand and gravel control company. A site has been surveyed in Wusong to store huge quantities of sand and gravel. Sand and gravel are produced in Huzhou in Zhejiang Province and Sijiao in Jiangsu Province, etc., and are the main raw materials for construction projects. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Huzhou sand has been scarce due to transportation difficulties. The yellow sand arriving in Shanghai is all transported by帆船 from Sijiao offshore. The price of sand before the war was about two yuan per ton, but after the war, due to the urgent need for Japanese construction of forts and other projects, the price has skyrocketed to more than ten yuan. The Zhejiang authorities have strictly ordered a ban on exports. If the Japanese side controls it, the sand needed by the construction industry will also become a problem. It is said that sand and gravel merchants are extremely worried and will gather to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Members of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, including Ren Cheng and Cheng Yongtai, have raised tens of thousands of yuan to send personnel to be stationed on a regular basis, setting up temporary grain purchasing firms at various ports in northern Jiangsu, specializing in purchasing miscellaneous grains such as wheat and soybeans for sale in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, in November of last year, the firms loaded more than 4,500 bags of wheat and transported them from the port to Shanghai. When passing near Yanglin and Liuhe, they were robbed by bandits on horseback, resulting in a loss of as much as 43,40,000 yuan. The firms jointly reported to the association and notified the industry not to buy stolen goods. On the other hand, they sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. Now it is learned that the wheat has been sold by Ji to a certain party in batches and delivered in Jiading and Datong, then loaded on ships and shipped to Qingdao. Now the association, after verifying the facts and evidence, will report to the police for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Sino-American Loan Can Be Repaid in Two and a Half Years, China's Tung Oil Exports to the United States Are Quite Large <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>This Sino-American loan is secured by China's special product, tung oil. According to economists, the loan can be repaid in two and a half years at most. The United States imports tung oil every year, accounting for 70% of China's total exports. In 1937, China's tung oil exports were 1,029,789 piculs, worth 89,845,563 yuan (then the total value of tung oil imported by the United States should be about 63 million yuan. The total amount of the new Sino-American loan is 25 million US dollars, or 150 million legal tender. This number only equals 2.4 times the annual value of China's tung oil exports to the United States, so the loan can be repaid in two and a half years.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Japanese Yarn Dumping in the Mainland, Chinese Merchants and Factories Actively Resist, Guerrillas Enforce Regulations on Punishing Traitors, Cotton Weavers Change to Weaving Native Cloth with Good Sales <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side has long intended to seize China's entire yarn industry. Since the "August 13th" Shanghai war, most of the Chinese-owned yarn factories have been in the war zone, and the Japanese side took the opportunity to seize them and monopolize the cotton weaving industry in the guerrilla areas, hoping to achieve the goal of controlling the yarn industry. However, the factories in the mainland would rather sacrifice their business than cooperate, and they advocated spinning and weaving native cloth, which is sold everywhere. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Control the Yarn Industry</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai war moved west, the Japanese yarn factories in Hongkou and Caojiadu in western Shanghai, the main base of the Japanese yarn industry, have regrouped and recruited workers to manufacture day and night. On the one hand, they colluded with the puppet organization to collect cotton at low prices in the mainland areas controlled by the Japanese army. On the other hand, they arbitrarily increased the price of yarn. Under the three principles of low wages, suppressed raw materials, and increased market prices of products, it can be said that the Japanese yarn industry has developed unprecedentedly, but they are still not satisfied and want to control the yarn market single-handedly. They used special forces to increase taxes on Chinese and foreign merchants' yarn and thread transported to the mainland to resist them. Chinese and foreign yarn factories cannot compete, and the mainland has almost become a Japanese yarn market.</p>
<p>Mainland Factories Refuse to Purchase Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>The production areas of machine-woven cotton cloth have always been known for Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changshu, Wuxian, Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading and other counties in Jiangsu Province. It is estimated that there are more than 3,500 large-scale factories. Their sales are mainly in Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou in southern China, and Wenzhou, Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, Wuhu, Shexian in Anhui Province, etc. The factories suffered heavy losses in the war. Later, those with more capital tried to continue to start work. However, the mainland was full of Japanese yarn, so the factories were mostly forced to use it in terms of raw materials. Since October of last year, the crackdown on Japanese goods has been very strict everywhere, and the Japanese yarn purchased was intercepted by guerrillas on the way during transportation, causing manufacturers to suffer heavy losses. According to the reporter of Xiandai She, after inquiring from the cotton weaving merchants stationed in Shanghai in the mainland, the manufacturers, considering that they are in the midst of a long-term war of resistance, are willing to sacrifice their business for fear that the mainland's assets will flow out and vow not to purchase Japanese yarn. However, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants who are greedy for profit and still do not hesitate to solicit business for Japanese merchants or open factories to manufacture. They are being closely investigated and cracked down on. It is now learned that guerrillas everywhere have followed the regulations on punishing traitors promulgated by the central government. If they find anyone trafficking in Japanese goods or using raw materials to open factories for manufacturing, they will be shot immediately after being arrested.</p>
<p>Change to Weaving Native Cloth with Good Sales</p>
<p>Recently, cotton weaving manufacturers in the mainland have advocated changing to weaving native cloth, implementing self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-dyeing, and converting the original iron and wooden machines into native cloth weaving machines. In addition to collective work, cotton is distributed to the countryside to spin yarn, and then the yarn is distributed to the people to weave cloth. It is now learned that since the promotion of this native cloth, the sales in the Shanghai market have been very wide. It is also widely used in Shantou, Fujian, Wenzhou, etc., and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has issued a certificate of pure domestic production. This native cloth has light weight and high profit, so all factories are planning to change to weaving.</p>

<p>The film companies in this city all suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the "August 13th" war, and film production was suspended. Later, they tried to recover and started filming one after another. The fact that the Chinese film industry can still continue to develop on the isolated island depends on the hard work of the company authorities. Although there were rumors that the major companies in Shanghai had compromised with the Japanese puppets, it was purely fabricated and was obviously a conspiracy to sow discord. The Shanghai film industry, except for a few scums, all value integrity and firmly reject all threats and inducements. However, due to environmental constraints and limitations in financial resources, they had unconsciously filmed supernatural films in the past, which aroused the concern of the cultural circles in this city. Now it is learned that the authorities of the film companies have long felt that supernatural films should not be filmed, and have automatically determined the filming policy. They will uphold the original intention of assisting social education and film more new films that are beneficial to the people. They are deeply grateful for the concern of the people from all walks of life and are happy to accept any criticism, guidance and assistance. It is expected that the Shanghai film industry will continue the glorious history before the war and carry it forward.</p>

<p>After overseas Chinese tycoon Hu Wenhu decided to invest in the development of the rich resources in the southwest, all the work is gradually becoming concrete. The development fund is tentatively set at 30 million national currency. The first step is to carry out the mining of minerals in Yunnan Province. In addition to sending Cai Xianzhang, Hu Zhaoxiang, and others to Yunnan to investigate reclamation areas, he has also hired mining engineer Huang Fengjun and eight skilled personnel to return to China and go to Yunnan to engage in mineral exploration work before proceeding with formal mining.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Relief Society and Yunnan Provincial Government Negotiate Resettlement of Refugees, In Addition to Reclaiming Wasteland, Promoting Sericulture <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>After the Relief Committee implemented the transfer of war-zone refugees to the southwest for development, the committee has sent a member, He Chongjie, to Yunnan to negotiate with the provincial government on the arrangement of refugee production matters, such as wasteland reclamation and sericulture. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reclaiming Wasteland</p>
<p>Yunnan Province is located in the tropics, rich in resources that are inexhaustible. It is sparsely populated and has a vast area of 400,000 square kilometers with a population of only 13 million people. Thanks to the efforts of Chairman Long of the province over the years, those who have reclaimed wasteland include the草地墾荒區 at the intersection of the滇越 railway and the箇碧 railway, the绿野 plain. The transportation is very convenient. There is a開蒙墾殖局 under the Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission, with a jurisdiction of 100,000 mu. The director, Yang Wenbo, has been working hard for two years and spent more than 300,000 yuan. The water interest has been removed, the water conservancy project will be completed soon, and the property rights are completely publicly owned. 1,400 tenant households have been recruited and more than 8,000 mu of rice fields have been cultivated. It is expected that 30,000 mu will be cultivated in February this year, of which 10,000 mu are in urgent need of tenant recruitment, which can accommodate 500 refugee households. The provincial government welcomes the Relief Committee to immigrate and reclaim. The思普 area along the border can reclaim 700,000 mu of paddy fields, 3 million mu of dry fields, and 7 million mu of mountain fields. The cultivated land is sown at will, and there is already a surplus of grain. The price of one meter is only 25 cents in national currency per 20 catties. In addition, there are a large number of special products, such as tea, cotton, camphor, bamboo, wood,楼榔, coconuts, and pomelos. In弥勒, there are more than 100,000 mu of wasteland, and in建水 and開遠, there are also 40,000 to 50,000 mu of wasteland. In addition to the continuous efforts of the provincial government, the Relief Committee, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Hu Wenhu, the Central Land Administration College, and the Zhejiang Agricultural College are all conducting separate surveys.</p>
<p>Promoting Sericulture</p>
<p>The sericulture production business is presided over by the Director of the Department of Construction, who also serves as the Director of the Sericulture Production Farm, and the technician Chang Zonghui of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The farm is located at Changpo, ten kilometers away from the provincial capital. Last year, 1,000 mu of mulberry land was reclaimed. From the spring to the autumn of this year, the reclamation and planting will be expanded to 10,000 mu, which can accommodate 200 refugees to work on the farm. Regarding the production conditions for refugees: Those who are healthy, between the ages of 20 and 40, are employed all year round, with monthly wages ranging from 9 to 12 national currency, providing accommodation, and self-catering. There is a public kitchen for workers. Refugee couples can work together. If they have one or two children, they can also be accommodated. Refugees are given two hours of lessons every night to guide self-planting mulberry and silkworm rearing. It has been actively promoted by the Relief Committee and the Provincial Government. As for tea production, Yunnan Province has the most hope. Most of Yunnan Province is located in the tropics, and it is located in重山叠岭 with a climate and soil that are most suitable for tea planting. Kunming,宜良,保山, and蒙自 all produce tea, especially the Pu'er tea in the southwest, which is famous at home and abroad. After years of careful planning by Chairman Long, the export sales are very smooth, with an annual output of 70,000担. Recently, in a certain tea mountain range in Yuxi and Yinan, wild tea trees were found. The trees are tall, the leaves are larger than the palm, and the buds are fat and the pistils are strong. Moreover, there is no cold in all seasons, and the growing time is extremely long, nearly ten months from the vernal equinox to the beginning of winter, which can be picked at any time. There is a hope of 100,000担 per year.</p>

<p>Among the flour mills in Shanghai that have started work after the war are Fufeng and Fuxin in the Public Concession. Now, because the production areas of domestic raw wheat are monopolized by Japanese merchants, resulting in transportation difficulties and a sharp decline in arrivals, they have to order foreign wheat from the United States. A total of 10,000 tons have been traded. The wheels are loaded and transported to Shanghai in batches from the United States. The first batch can be transported to Shanghai by the end of this month for the mills to produce flour. As for the import of foreign wheat last year, only 17公担 were imported, worth 193 yuan. Compared with the previous year, it decreased by 430,446公担, worth 2,654,357 yuan.</p>

<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, the Roman Catholic Vatican recently awarded two Gregory the Great Medals to the teachers of Aurora University in this city as a reward for their enthusiasm for teaching at church schools. It is said that the two teachers awarded this medal are Dagot, a Frenchman who also works as a lawyer in Shanghai, and Krzysinski, a Pole. However, both teachers are currently not in Shanghai. Dagot has returned to France on vacation, and Krzysinski has been recalled to Warsaw by his government.</p>

<p>Aires, the district chief of the Old Gate Police Station in the Public Concession, has served for more than 37 years, gradually rising from a Western police officer to his current position. Now that he has reached the age of retirement, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai next Tuesday (the 10th) on the Empress of Asia to return home. Last Thursday, his colleagues at the police station held a banquet to bid farewell to Aires, and Deputy Police Chief Robertson presented him with a beautiful cigarette holder as a souvenir.</p>

<p>The parcel post sent by foreigners in this city was previously illegally inspected by the Japanese and was often unreasonably detained and refused to be forwarded, which caused many disputes at the time. Later, foreigners from various countries asked their consulates to lodge protests with the Japanese, demanding that the inspection be stopped immediately, but to no avail. The Japanese still used the excuse of preventing the supply of munitions, drugs, and grain to the guerrilla army to carry out the inspection as usual. Foreigners suffered a lot of trouble and obstruction. Unexpectedly, recently, the Japanese suddenly became more aggravated. Regardless of the nationality of the people, if there are parcels to be sent to the guerrilla areas on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line, they must be opened and inspected. The sender should also be subject to inquiries and interrogations by the Japanese inspectors at any time and must not disobey, otherwise the sent items will be detained and confiscated. Most foreigners are indignant about this and believe that this kind of behavior by the Japanese is a bad precedent that has never been seen in the postal inspection system of various countries in the world. They have been reporting to their consuls one after another for days, requesting them to lodge protests again.</p>

<p>Leading Consul</p>
<p>The former Norwegian Consul General and Leading Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Or, left Shanghai in September due to his promotion to a new position. When the局 said goodbye to Mr. Or, it was said that the duties of the Leading Consul have become increasingly heavy in recent years. It is even more important for the Consular Corps and the局 to maintain cooperation on matters related to the administrative institutions of this city. The position of Leading Consul was succeeded by the Italian Consul General Mr. Naron. Before Mr. Na returned to Shanghai, it was temporarily replaced by the Portuguese Consul General Mr. Alves.</p>
<p>Death</p>
<p>The famous educator Dr. Liu Zhanen was assassinated last year. Mr. Liu once served as a member of the Educational Committee of the局, and his service was of great value. Mr. Xu Xinliu served as a director of the局 for ten consecutive years and unfortunately died in August, which is a pity. In addition, there were also Mr. Tanaka, former member of the Music Committee of the局, Mr. Wang, former member of the Public Utilities Committee of the局, Dr. Novaro, Portuguese Minister to China, Dr. Raubault, Director of the Health Department of the French Concession, Mr. Bode, Deputy Director-General of the局, Mr. Smith, former Director-General of the局, Mr. Huang Zi, former member of the Music Committee of the局, Mr. Antesen, founder of the Special Patrol of the局, and Captain Huchkins, former member of the Library Committee of the局, all passed away last year.</p>
<p>Mortuary</p>
<p>After the transportation between this port and the mainland was blocked, it was inconvenient for the bereaved families to transport coffins back to their hometowns. Therefore, some people set up several mortuaries in the concession. The residents of the Western District complained a lot about these mortuaries being located in residential areas. However, the Health Department of the局 believed that if the corpses were coffined in a proper manner, it would not be harmful to public health and would not emit any odor. After the Board of Directors of the局 discussed this issue several times in June last year, it was decided that mortuaries should not be allowed to be set up in the concession or on the roads outside the Western District adjacent to residential areas. All plans to set up mortuaries have been approved by the Works Department, which has designated certain places to be allowed to set up. However, each mortuary must be subject to the inspection and management of the局.</p>
<p>Slum Hygiene</p>
<p>The局 adopted the recommendation of the Works Department and tried to improve the hygiene conditions of the slum areas and their surroundings. Some of the minimum measures regarding drains, toilets, water sources, and garbage have been implemented jointly by the Health and Works Departments in the Western District.</p>
<p>Entertainment Tax</p>
<p>The局 has no right to forcibly collect entertainment tax, but for the sake of relieving refugees, it has sent letters to 17 theaters in the concession, asking them to voluntarily collect this donation. The licensees of each theater have expressed their agreement. Therefore, the additional donation has been implemented since January 20 last year. Later, ice skating rinks and swimming pools in the concession also charged the same donation. The total amount of this donation remitted to the局 for the whole year can be about 275,000 yuan.

<p>At 10 pm on the 1st of this month, a strange case occurred at the Chunjiang Western Restaurant next to the Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Around 9:30 pm on that day, four well-dressed customers suddenly came to the western restaurant. Unexpectedly, after they had just gone upstairs and settled down for less than ten minutes, one of the four suddenly</p>
<p>Jumped Off the Building</p>
<p>and fled, and the remaining three chased after him with guns. After leaving the door, the whereabouts of everyone were unknown. However, when the three rushed to chase, they also abandoned a pistol. After the incident, the owner of the restaurant reported to the police. The police chief sent detectives to inspect the scene. He believed that it might contain political relations and actively</p>
<p>Started Investigating</p>
<p>It was not until yesterday that it was learned that the person who jumped off the building and fled first was Liu Wanjun, who had previously served as the captain of a certain team of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Now Liu has changed his name to Liu Zhiheng and has been appointed by a certain party to an important position in Pudong, but he has not yet taken office. That night, two people who knew Liu invited Liu to Liu's home on Shan Zhong Road to have dinner at the Chunjiang Restaurant. Unexpectedly, before a few words, the three of them suddenly took out</p>

<p>The police have gone to Liu's home to inquire based on the above clues, but Liu has not returned home so far, so Liu's current whereabouts are still unknown.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the puppet "District Court" in Nanshi, its detention center for prisoners was converted from the burnt-down District Court into a prison due to limited funds. However, there was no money to hire people, so more than a dozen old beggars were recruited as guards. There were no weapons and no food for the prisoners, which was not a good situation. Therefore, most of the prisoners were transferred to the憲兵隊 for detention. In addition, the puppet "Judicial" Office in Pudong has now been merged and abolished on the 20th of this month after negotiation with the puppet "Court."</p>

<p>The vagrants Zhou Shifeng, Chen Fumin, Wang Fugui, Bao Shida, and Gao Yunpeng colluded with the Russian Pao Lisi to impersonate detectives from the Public Concession and the French Concession police stations. On the pretext of searching for opium, they defrauded huge sums of money from妓院 such as Miaozhen Shuyu at No. 4, Lane 726, Fuzhou Road. The amount of money defrauded in just a few months reached several thousand yuan. Later, Hua Chief Detective You Agen and Detective Chen Ruisheng of the Old Gate Police Station arrested Zhou and others and sent them to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court and announced the verdict. Zhou Yifeng, Chen Fumin, and Pao Lisi were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Wang Fugui and Bao Shida were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Gao Yunpeng was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment. The lawyer of the police station, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendants had also committed the same events in the French Concession, and requested a transfer. After Judge Feng inquired with the detectives of the French police station, he approved the six defendants to be taken away by the French police station for investigation.</p>

<p>The Public Concession authorities are actively carrying out the opening of Hongkou. The Japanese side has agreed to try to open a part of it. Therefore, the merchants and residents living in Hongkou (the area south of Hongqiao Hong) have been returning to their old homes one after another to reorganize their shops and resume business. However, merchants and residents returning to Hongkou must first obtain a pass from the Japanese side before they can move freely. It is difficult to obtain this pass. Most of them are entrusted by Japanese people to obtain it on their behalf. There are also many who are unable to obtain the pass due to economic difficulties or having no acquaintances with the Japanese, so they have not returned for a long time. Therefore, except for the triangle field and the small vegetable market nearby, about 70% of the shops on the streets of Hongkou have reopened, but Japanese-owned shops still account for 30% of them. Among them, only 40% to 50% of the shops on the streets have reopened. The market is still difficult to prosper. After 6 pm, the shops close one after another, and the night market is very depressed.</p>

<p>Wang Jilian, a farmer from Xiaotangjiazhai behind Longhua Town, moved to No. 14, Qianhujiazhai, Xujiahui Town, the home of his relatives after the Shanghai war. Wang only had one son, named Genfu, who is 19 years old and works as a mechanic in the Kangjiaqiao China Underwear Factory. This spring, Wang hired Quanmei, the second daughter of Hu Gengsheng, who planted flowers in the Catholic Church at No. 31 next door (18 years old, formerly a female worker in the warehouse of a pharmacy on Wenlin Road,) as his daughter-in-law through a matchmaker. They got married on August 13th last year. The relationship between the couple was very harmonious. Unexpectedly, Qi Zhongbing (also known as Xiaogou), the son of Qi Meihong, a Danyang native who opened a noodle shop in Xujiahui Town, seduced and bewitched her in every possible way. Recently, he instigated Quanmei to elope without a trace on the evening of the 27th of last month. Before leaving, she stole a gold bracelet, gold chain,鎖片, and gold ring (weighing eight taels). and more than 400 yuan in legal tender.

<h3 id="e84">Police Substation on Great Western Road Closed: Reason for Closure is That the Road Falls Under the Jurisdiction of the Concession; British Military Authorities Had the Right to Close It <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The former substation of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Great Western Road, east of Columbia Road, which is an extraterritorial road in Shanghai's western district, was occupied by police sent by the "Grand Avenue Government's Puppet Police Bureau" after the westward retreat of the National Revolutionary Army during the Shanghai Battle. On the 5th of this month, British troops suddenly used barbed wire to seal off the windows and doors of the "Puppet Police Substation." It is now understood that the reason for the British troops' closure of the "Puppet Police Substation" is that the area falls under the jurisdiction of the Concession's roads, and therefore the British military authorities had the right to close it, which is not inappropriate. The order was issued by British Major General Smallwood to carry out the closure. However, all the puppet police uniforms, wooden furniture, and other assets inside were not moved.</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports that neither the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" nor the Japanese who protect it have lodged a protest regarding the British military's closure of the puppet police station at the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road, and it is expected that no protest will be lodged. The British military authorities believe that the puppet police station is within the British defense zone outside the Concession's roads, so the British military has the right to close it without consulting any party in advance. According to reports, Major General Smallwood ordered the closure on Thursday morning, and Major Ashmore of the British garrison in Shanghai led a team of East Surrey Regiment troops to carry it out. The puppet police station was a one-story building. When it was closed, there were several puppet police officers in plain clothes inside. When the British troops ordered them to leave, they did not resist and quietly left the building. The British troops then piled the sundries outside, locked the doors, and nailed barbed wire to the windows. The entire process took ninety minutes. The Chinese and English notices posted still stated yesterday (the 6th), "Closed by order of the British military," and various sundries were still piled up on the side of the road yesterday.</p>

<p>Guo Xin-kang, a young man from Ningbo, was twenty years old. He had been working as an apprentice at the Nanyang Catering Company at 28 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Recently, due to gambling losses, he suffered economic pressure and could not make amends. He had a momentary impulse and secretly swallowed Lysol at the company at 2 PM on the 6th. At about 4 PM, his colleagues discovered it and immediately sent him to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road. However, he was too poisoned and the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6 PM. The hospital reported it to the police, who moved the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Funyuan branch. Yesterday, they reported it to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, for an examination of the body. His uncle, Guo A-xiang, signed a statement to claim the body.</p>

<p>At a time when refugees are facing difficulties obtaining supplies and various sectors of society are conducting telethons and fundraising activities, it has been discovered that Shen Zhi-guang, director of the Fahua No. 42 Reception Center affiliated with the Pudong Building Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, deputy director Song Mei-xi, assistant Cao Lin-sen, inspector Cai Zu-ying, Zhao Wei-lian, and others, have been embezzling refugee food and selling it for their own profit. In addition, because the refugee Zhang Boyuan, from Baoshan,</p>
<p>Secretly Exposed</p>
<p>the matter and reported it to the branch, they harbored resentment and, on December 3 of last year, subjected Zhang to private torture, causing him to die from serious injuries. The case was reported to Liu Shao-kui, the chief Chinese detective of the Public Concession's General Inspectorate, detective Song Bing-zheng, and others, who arrested Shen Zhi-guang and others. Li Zhi-shan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court based on Articles 278, 336, and 305 of the Criminal Code for causing death by injury, embezzling publicly held property, and obstructing freedom, requesting that the court</p>
<p>Strictly Punish Them</p>
<p>The case has been heard once by the Special Court, and the details have been reported in a Japanese newspaper. In order to seek the true facts of the case and gain a clearer understanding, the police planned to find Zhang Boyuan's coffin so that the court committee could examine the extent of Zhang's injuries. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Liu and Song, the two detectives, accompanied Zhang Boyuan's son, Zhang Ai-yi, to the Pu'an Temporary Coffin Repository on Columbia Road. Zhang's son pointed out the hall where his father's coffin was placed. The detectives found that the coffin should have been black, but it had</p>
<p>Turned White</p>
<p>Moreover, the corpse in the coffin was not Zhang Boyuan, but a female corpse. The detectives were deeply suspicious. Zhang's son confirmed that it was his father's coffin without any mistake. Now, in addition to the coffin changing color, the corpse has also changed from male to female. It is unclear whether the coffin repository made a mistake in the location of the coffin, or whether there is something else going on. The police are paying close attention to the matter and are currently conducting a secret and detailed investigation, striving to get to the bottom of the truth.</p>

<p>According to a fisherman from Qushan Island, Dinghai County, who arrived in Shanghai, the fisherman recently led his companions to fish in the waters off Huang Dayang, Qushan Island. At that time, they caught a strange fish in their net, which resembled a wild boar. The fish's tail was golden, and its eyes were bright. However, the companions all thought it was a god and released the fish back into the sea. According to experienced net fishermen, the creature is an amphibian or a female dragon fish.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Race Club's New Year Charity Sweepstake tickets for this year were drawn as scheduled at 7 PM on the 3rd of this month and were determined according to the results of the Shanghai Race Club's Sweepstake Race on the 4th. It is reported that the Club's Board of Directors, in order to benefit the refugees more, donated all the miscellaneous expenses related to the printing of the sweepstake tickets, the winning number slips, all announcements, and the holding of the drawing, and did not deduct them from the commissions received. The staff also handled the matter voluntarily, and their enthusiasm is commendable and rare. The total number of tickets was 110,000. If all tickets were sold out, the first prize would be 8,400 yuan, based on the actual number of tickets sold, as detailed in the ticket rules. This time, the actual sales were from number one to number 75,350, including one free ticket for every 50 tickets purchased (each ticket with one number costing 20 cents), totaling 13,700 yuan. The commission was 25%, totaling 3,425 yuan. According to the regulations, 6% of the commission, or 822 yuan, was paid to the lottery ticket shops as sales commission. In addition, the printing fee for the tickets was originally 715 yuan due to the complicated procedures, but the printer, Yiwen Printing Bureau, generously reduced the price by 20% because it was a charitable cause, so the actual payment was 80%, or 572 yuan. The total expenditure was 1,394 yuan, leaving a net surplus of more than 2,031 yuan in national currency. The Club's Board of Directors yesterday entrusted Director Li Hongfa to carry a letter, a detailed list, and other items, representing the donation to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. It is said that the Association expressed its gratitude and admiration for this. Furthermore, yesterday's report mentioned that Wang Heng-dong and Lin San-he, bathhouse attendants employed by Xiaoyao Pool Bathhouse, won the first prize, which shows the excellent reputation of the bathhouse.</p>

<p>When Su Xi-wen took office as the puppet "Superintendent," in order to cultivate his cronies, he specially organized the puppet "Shanghai Youth Corps," which was very large in scope. He established "branch corps," appointed himself as "corps leader," Liu Yi-xian as the head of the civil affairs section, Du Huai as the "training section chief," Liu Xiang-sheng as the "accounting section chief," Chen Zuo-wu as the "deputy corps leader," and Tong Di-hua as the "organization section chief." Each puppet "director of administrative affairs" also served as the "branch corps leader," widely recruiting young people to facilitate their seduction. However, those with a sense of patriotism were unwilling to work for the enemy and become treacherous slaves, so they filled the ranks of "corps members" with rascals and petty traitors, calling it "training," but in reality it was just a pretense. The corps headquarters was set up inside the puppet "Superintendent's Office." Later, because Su was busy with flattering the Japanese, he appointed Su Xin, the puppet "police chief of Pudong branch bureau," as the concurrent "corps leader." After the puppet "Superintendent's Office" was reorganized into the puppet "Municipal Government," the "corps" also moved to Jiangwan. However, Su Xin was a businessman by origin, unfamiliar with politics, and achieved nothing. After Fu Xiao-an came to power, he used various means to squeeze out Su Xi-wen's cronies. More than a dozen people have been dismissed one after another. Su Xin had no choice but to resign from the puppet "Municipal Government," which Fu approved without consulting Su Xi-wen. Fu appointed himself as "corps leader." From then on, the puppet "Shanghai Youth Corps," which Su Xi-wen had founded, was seized by Fu.</p>

<p>Zhang Guan-sheng, a farmer from Chuansha, in order to plunder the people's wealth last year, spent a huge sum of money, thousands of gold, to lobby Lu Tie-ying, the puppet "district chief" of Chuansha, and obtained a puppet "town leader" position, who was sent to show off on Xu Jia-lu Road, Shangchuan Road, in the town. From then on, he oppressed the common people, committed all kinds of evil, falsely accused good people as thieves, arbitrarily extorted money, and accumulated a lot of ill-gotten wealth. Xu Hong-fa, the head of the puppet army, became jealous. Recently, he asked Zhang to borrow 1,000 yuan, but Zhang ignored him. Xu Hong-fa became angry and suddenly sent the puppet "army" to loot Xu Town the other day, and accused Zhang, the puppet "town leader," of colluding with the guerrillas, kidnapping him and demanding a huge ransom. If they were ignored again, they threatened to hand him over to the Japanese army for execution. This shows the internal strife and mutual harm within the puppet regime. Petty traitors should also wake up.</p>

<p>The strength of the Chinese guerrilla force in Pudong is growing stronger day by day. The Japanese garrison troops stationed along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Chuansha railways have been repeatedly harassed and feel unable to cope. The puppet army led by Xu Hong-fa in Chuansha has fewer than 200 men, and defections are common. The Japanese regard this puppet "army" as a chicken rib, so they plan to open up another path. Under the leadership of Omura, the commander of the Japanese army in Shanghai, they plan to organize another puppet "army" to be stationed in Zhangjiang, Beicai, Zhoupu, and other places to cut off direct conflict between the Japanese troops in Shanghai-Nanjing and the guerrillas, and to eliminate the threat they currently feel. It is reported that some unscrupulous people have been secretly running around for Omura, secretly recruiting for many days. After the Chinese learned about this kind of method of using Chinese to control Chinese, which is too vicious, they were unwilling to become the second Xu Hong-fa, so no one responded. The traitor has been running around for a month without being able to fulfill his mission. The expenses he received from Omura have already been considerable, and he is in a great panic. He recruited bandits from the Pudong Avenue area to fill the ranks. Once this puppet army is formed, the kidnapping and robbery in Pudong will inevitably become more rampant, and the villagers will not be able to live in peace.</p>

<p>The puppet "police bureau" previously, in order to prevent guerrilla activities, ordered the civilians in the four suburban areas to obtain a kind of puppet "citizen certificate" before they were allowed to pass. Recently, it has been heard that this method will be changed again, and they plan to manufacture round copper plates and force the civilians to obtain them and hang them around their necks with strings, so that the Japanese army can easily identify them when walking on the road. After this copper plate is made, those who have the original puppet "citizen certificate" must pay 60 cents each to obtain one, and those who do not have a puppet "certificate" must pay 1.5 yuan per piece. The methods of collecting money by the puppet organization are endless.</p>

<p>The China Press reports that yesterday it was learned that on Thursday night (the 5th), detectives from the General Patrol Room found another handgun lost by the Public Concession police in a house on Yuyuan Road. The gun was a .38 caliber automatic handgun. A few weeks ago, a Chinese police officer was robbed of the gun on Brennan Road, which was loaded with seven bullets. There have been two cases of Chinese police officers being robbed of their handguns. After an exchange of fire between the police and bandits in Fahua West Town on Wednesday (the 4th), one of the lost guns was found in Xiaobang. The six men and two women captured have been detained by the Japanese military police. They were handed over to the Public Concession Police Department at noon on Thursday. Yesterday (the 6th), they were interrogated again. They will be detained by the Police Department for about a week, and then handed back to the Japanese. The Police Department also summoned several foreigners who were robbed on Columbia Road on December 28, so that they could, if possible, identify whether the arrested people were the bandits from the robbery that day. A total of thirteen men and women are currently in custody at the Police Department. It is said that they are all members of the same gang. In addition, on the afternoon of the 5th, detectives and reserve police from the Chengdu Road police station captured seven people in the Public Concession and two people in Caojiadu.</p>
<p>According to another report, at about 4 PM on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, Chinese and Western police officers from the Jing'an Temple police station, together with Japanese military police, arrested nine male and female bandits in a temporarily built wooden house at No. 420 Fahua Town, Western Shanghai. They confessed that there were three handguns, which they threw into the Fahua Port in front of the bandit den. The detectives sent people to recover one of the handguns on the spot, but the other two have not yet been found. Yesterday afternoon, the Police Department dispatched more than a dozen workers to the original location to pave the mud and install English-made water pumps to carry out the dredging work, because the river is silted up and it is not easy to find the guns in a short time.</p>

<p>Li Hongxing, a Shandong native and the owner of Li Hongxing Transportation Company in Mingde Lane, Malang Road, French Concession, went to the Dachina Match Company on the Enterprise Bank building on Sichuan Road in the afternoon of December 12 last year to settle accounts. At about 3 PM, he was at the bus stop at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Tianzhutang Street, waiting to take the French Commercial Route 21 bus home. Suddenly, the assassin, Liu Biao (aka Wang Jinlian, aka Little Dog, 23 years old, living in a thatched shed on Singapore Road), a Jiangbei native, rushed up and pulled out a handgun,</p>

<p>The bullet hit Li's body, but fortunately, it was not fatal. He quickly ran away and hired a car to go to the hospital for treatment. After the assassin fired the gun, he fled west. At the intersection of Zhubaoshan Road, he was caught by a Westerner, Gaul Laof (transliteration), with the help of a police officer. After being taken back to the police station, the detectives successively apprehended two suspects, Xu Zhi-cheng and Wang Jia-chang, and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention.

<p>Yesterday morning, Liao, the criminal division chief of the Second Special District Court, and Gao Yan-yan, the clerk, came to the criminal division to order the defendants to be tried. First, Yuan Jia-huang, the lawyer representing the French Concession authorities, stated the case and filed a public prosecution against Liu Biao, Xu Zhi-cheng, and Wang Jia-chang for attempted murder under Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Then, detective Tao Rong-lin reported the investigation process. According to the plaintiff, the victim Li Hongxing, he does not know the defendant Liu Biao, but he has a feud with Zeng Liang-cai over the competition for pier business.</p>
<p>He Asks to Arrest Zeng Liang-cai</p>
<p>for questioning so that the process of Zeng conspiring with Liu to kill me can be understood. As for Xu Zhi-cheng and Wang Jia-chang, they are both people from my family. I was walking with Xu Zhi-cheng that day, and when Xu heard the gunshots, he shouted for the police. Presumably, Xu and Wang have no relationship. Please release them. Liu Biao confessed that Gu Jin-kui, who works as a pimp in the Yongtaichang Hardware Store on Beijing Road, gave me a handgun and a photo of Li Hongxing, telling me that he was a bad person and telling me to hit him. When I fired the gun, Gu was also nearby. When he saw me being arrested,</p>
<p>He Immediately Fled</p>
<p>I don't know Xu and Wang. Xu Zhi-cheng confessed that he does not know Liu and is a sworn brother with Li Hongxing. He accompanied Li to the match company that day to settle accounts. As they were preparing to get on the bus, someone shot Li from behind. I don't know Gu Jin-kui. I have been relying on Li for more than ten years, please investigate. Wang Jia-chang confessed that he works as an accountant for Li Hongxing, does not know Liu Biao, and does not admit to participating in the assassination. The court verified the confessions and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 17th because the case still needs to be investigated. The defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Zhang Hui-fang, also known as Zhang A-liu, the brigade commander of the Chinese guerrillas in the Chuansha and Shangchuan Road areas of Pudong, has more than 5,000 men under his command, and his military equipment is quite sufficient. Not long ago, he invaded the Japanese defense line along Pugaio and Yangjing, so he is most hated by the Japanese army. A notice was issued with a reward of 5,000 yuan for his arrest. During the last Japanese general offensive on Fengnan and Chuansha, in order to preserve his strength, Zhang moved his troops to the coast. However, his brother, Zhang A-mao, had his house burned down by the Japanese army. At present, they are facing each other across the Huogongtang River. It is rumored that Zhang came to Shanghai the other day on business. He boarded a small boat in disguise at the dock. Unexpectedly, he was shot by reactionaries. Zhang was hit in the chest. The assassin was arrested, and more than a dozen accomplices were also arrested and executed at the same time. Zhang was sent to Shanghai for medical treatment on the original ship.</p>

<p>Robbery</p>
<p>The Shanghai West area is rife with gambling and opium dens, resulting in frequent appearances of petty thieves. Last night at 8:30 PM, a Westerner's residence at No. 8 Dunxin Road was infiltrated by thieves. The owner discovered them and gave chase, but was unable to apprehend them. The owner immediately blew a police whistle. It was initially believed to be a serious incident and was reported to the police, who dispatched a patrol car. Upon investigation, the thieves had already fled.</p>
<p>Shen Abing, a 50-year-old man from Shaoxing, resided at No. 748 Yangjiafen Mountain, Tiantong Road, Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, Shen visited his fellow townsman He Xingzhi on the upper floor of the Yongxing Coal Shop nearby. Two robbers were in the process of stealing 15 yuan in legal tender from He Xingzhi's person, preparing to flee. Shen's sudden arrival startled them. In desperation, the robbers fired a pistol, hitting Shen Abing in the left leg. Shen immediately collapsed, bleeding on the ground, and the two robbers escaped.

<h3 id="e105">Newly Discovered Remedy for Gonorrhea Excites the Medical World <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The American discovery of Pasulfamide has caused a global frenzy, with medical journals vying to publish news about it. The following excerpts are from the actual experimental reports of the most famous medical saints. This translation aims to give the Chinese people a brief understanding of what Pasulfamide is and its value in treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Dr. Keefer and Dr. Spink, professors at Harvard Medical School, used this drug to treat gonorrheal arthritis. The results showed that after 200 applications of the drug, no gonococci were found in the synovial fluid or in the affected areas of the reproductive tract. Therefore, they stated, "We have never been able to eliminate bacteria from synovial fluid in such a short period of time with other treatments."</p>
<p>Dr. Whitby, a famous urologist in London, commented on the value of Pasulfamide: "This drug has been proven to be the most effective drug for treating gonorrhea. Because it is not only excreted from the urine, but also deeply penetrates the blood and tissue fluids, it is believed to be the best drug for gonorrhea."</p>
<p>The British Medical Journal stated in the following commentary: "In addition to its other outstanding functions, Pasulfamide is now unanimously regarded as a reliable urinary disinfectant. Its characteristics are rapid efficacy, consistent excretion, and no need to rely on acidification of the urine (which is not easily achieved by the average patient, and its taste is not difficult to take)."</p>
<p>The "New Lede Ning," a special drug for treating gonorrhea from the Xinxing Western Pharmacy, uses this Pasulfamide as its main ingredient, supplemented with other carefully selected analgesic, digestive, and bowel-movement-aiding medicines to create tablets. The medicine is powerful, its properties are safe, and it is more suitable for the physiological differences between men and women, with careful dosing. It is truly an unprecedented gospel for gonorrhea sufferers.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Communication) This year's freshmen of national universities have been uniformly recruited and assigned to various colleges by the Ministry of Education. However, this year's admitted students mostly come from war zones and have been affected by the war in the past year, making it impossible to study with peace of mind, resulting in basic subjects not meeting the standards. In order to remedy the situation and solidify their foundations, the Ministry of Education has issued the "Remedial Measures for Basic Subjects for Freshmen in National Colleges and Universities in the 27th Year" and ordered all colleges and universities to strictly supervise the students and appropriately increase teaching time so that they can make daily progress and meet the standards. The "Remedial Measures for Basic Subjects for Freshmen in National Colleges and Universities in the 27th Year" are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Colleges and universities (hereinafter referred to as "colleges and universities") shall provide remedial classes in accordance with the remedial measures to freshmen admitted in the 27th year (hereinafter referred to as "this year's freshmen") who are weak in basic subjects.</p>
<p>(2) Colleges and universities may adopt ability-based grouping methods for teaching Chinese, English, and mathematics to this year's freshmen, dividing them into groups A, B, C, and D according to their level in each subject. Those with the best level are placed in Group A, those with the next best level are placed in Group B, and so on.</p>
<p>(3) When colleges and universities implement the student ability-based grouping method, they may use testing methods to ensure that the grouping is appropriate and precise.</p>
<p>(4) After the implementation of ability-based grouping for Chinese, English, and mathematics in colleges and universities, the teaching materials for each group shall be formulated separately with reference to the level of the freshmen. The groups with lower levels should increase teaching time and extracurricular practice. When necessary, a part of the required courses for the first year may be reduced and moved to subsequent years for supplementary instruction.</p>
<p>(5) Freshmen in the faculties of arts and law and in departments of the Faculty of Agriculture that do not require mathematics may be exempt from remedial mathematics. However, they must separately receive remedial instruction in subjects such as history, geography, and biology.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to Chinese, English, and mathematics, which must be remedied, faculties of science, engineering, agriculture, and commerce may also separately remedy subjects such as physics and chemistry when necessary.</p>
<p>(7) At the end of the first year of this year's freshmen, colleges and universities should conduct strict examinations. Those who fail one of the subjects to be remedied must retake the course. Those who fail two subjects must repeat the grade. At the beginning of the freshmen's admission, these measures should be announced in advance so that each student knows what to strive for.</p>
<p>(8) The additional hours for each remedial subject will not be given credit.</p>
<p>(9) These measures shall be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education.</p>

As a result, the Filipinos won two sets in a row. In the second singles match, Xu Weipei played against Qia Weiya. Xu had superb skills and ease, and easily won the first set with 6-3. In the first set, Qia Weiya strove hard, but Xu Weipei acted rashly, causing Qia Weiya to equalize with 6-2. Both sides only played two sets due to time constraints, so it was a 1-1 draw. In the third doubles match, Qia-Sang played against Xu Runpei and Biji. Only one set was played. The Xu-Ji team lost 6-8 due to unfamiliar coordination. Looking at today's match, there were no exciting performances. Qia Weiya's skills were also mediocre, and his backhand smash was quite poor. The Xu brothers were also not as good as in the past.

<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science, Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The main purpose of sexual love is procreation. In addition, it also has important activity and excitement ability for the development of the human body, the goodness of psychological and intellectual enlightenment. Regarding the good and bad of human thoughts and the strength of will, the creator has infused it with spirit to beautify it. The physiological love of animals is transformed into the most honorable and precious emotion in humans. Moreover, its power can control all other mental functions. A man and a woman progress from friendship to love, from love to marriage, and then form a family. Thus, the role of sexual love comes to fruition. This process of love is set by the creator, approved by the teaching of rites, and publicly approved by society. Therefore, the advanced spiritual love is the maintenance of human history. The greatest of human will power is love. Everything in the universe can determine one's life through love. This is indeed of the utmost importance. Energy also has a major relationship with human spirit. From a superficial point of view, although human intelligence and reasoning ability are not directly controlled by it, intelligence and measure vary depending on the strength of the person's energy. For example, if a person can maintain their virginity before marriage and live a regulated life after marriage, then that person will be able to adapt to the times and reap the benefits of their intelligence. Their mind will not be agitated, and their energy will not be dissipated and depleted. They will keep a calm mind, firm will, and always maintain vigorous mental activity, which can be used to cultivate love, create a career, and lay the foundation for their happiness.</p>
<p>The happiness after marriage is determined by the soundness of sexual love. So how can we prevent this sexual function from becoming pathological? In short, it is to maintain cleanliness before marriage and not develop bad habits that damage the body and mind. After marriage, avoid indulgence, lest you be swept into this unfortunate vortex and sacrifice the greatest happiness in life. With the recent progress of endocrinology, testicular essence preparations, "Male Body Supplement Kang", can be used to completely cure symptoms such as youth decline or reproductive weakness. Its success in treating premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and infertility after marriage has reached the realm of clinical application.</p>
<p>Why has "Body Supplement Kang" been able to exert this amazing effect? This is because the ingredients used are extracted from the essence of young animal testicles and refined thoroughly. Essence is produced and kidneys are nourished within 24 hours. Its effect is invincible!</p>

<p>"A chronic cough easily turns into tuberculosis." This is a warning that is known to almost everyone. A chronic cough can injure the pleura. At this time, the lungs feel stabbing pain, which is a symbol of the early stage of lung disease. But if you can try your best to seek treatment in this preliminary stage, you can often turn danger into safety. From my more than 20 years of experience, the best way to improve your health is to actively take the German lung medicine "Pulmonary Nall", which has special effects in relieving coughs and stopping tuberculosis. No matter how severe the cough is, taking "Pulmonary Nall" can completely calm the cough within three hours. It can also reduce the oxygen function of the lungs and cause tuberculosis bacteria to lose their activity. Therefore, even if there are symptoms of tuberculosis, such as hemoptysis, expectoration, shortness of breath, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever, taking it will cure them immediately. It can also cure stubborn whooping cough and senile asthma, and can achieve success in a few days.</p>

<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctorate</p>
<p>... As of the end of 1938, "Kelinnong" still maintained the highest score record.</p>
<p>... All newly emerging gonorrhea drugs still cannot catch up and do not get the gonorrhea championship!</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a disease that is fierce and difficult to cure, which makes patients feel extremely anxious and throw in miscellaneous drugs indiscriminately, hoping to be cured as soon as possible. However, they do not know that the result is counterproductive and delays the treatment a lot. In my clinical years, I have always been distressed by the lack of suitable oral drugs for gonorrhea, not to mention the word specific drugs. Most patients are ignorant and ignorant, and they see the magnificent advertisement and think that it is a new drug and abuse it. As a result, it is still the same type of goods as the original penetrating bactericidal and sandalwood oil preparations. As a gonorrhea expert, I have tried every new gonorrhea drug that is launched every year, but they have all failed. I feel that although there are many new drugs on the market, like bamboo shoots after rain, most of them are not worthy of their name.</p>
<p>History shows us that truth cannot be obliterated, and genuine drugs cannot be eliminated. "Kelinnong", invented by German Dr. Peter, has been popular in five continents for many years. Gonorrhea experts and VD hospitals in various countries all use "Kelinnong" as an oral drug for gonorrhea. Taking "Kelinnong" for all new and old leukorrhea in men and women, such as prostatitis, orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, anterior and posterior urethritis, and female gonorrhea leukorrhea, will quickly and completely cure. According to a report from the Berlin Medical Research Association in December 1938, it said that the drug "Kelinnong" still maintained the highest record of gonorrhea treatment experience this year. Germany is the most advanced country in the world in medicine, and its words can be guaranteed to be a gonorrhea-specific drug "Kelinnong". I hope that gonorrhea patients will pay attention!</p>

<p>The prostate gland is in front of the bladder, and there are many nerves surrounding it. Those who overindulge in self-stimulation and sexual intercourse will cause local nerve weakness and lose their control, so it is easy to leak out. According to expert research, the so-called spermatorrhea is a symptom of chronic prostatitis, such as gonorrhea, bladder disease, excessive sexual intercourse, and self-stimulation. can make the prostate gland have the possibility of developing chronic inflammation. Patients with this disease not only often have semen-like material flowing out of the urethral opening, but also have various neurological symptoms, such as decreased libido, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, kidney atrophy, back pain, headache, lumbago, dizziness, palpitation, fatigue, and terror concepts. The patient's temperament is also becoming increasingly gloomy and depressed. They often hold a pessimistic view of their personal destiny. They feel that their disease is too serious, and their mental activity is reduced. As a result, pessimism often occurs.</p>
<p>The first treatment for this disease is to clear the mind and reduce desires to avoid stimulation of local nerves. As for drug treatment, only taking "Ners' Spermatorrhea Tablets" has definite effects. The function of the agent is to consolidate the sperm gate, reduce the sensitivity of the erection nerves, and stop any vicious spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea immediately after taking it. It also has the effect of calming the brain nerves, so that those with habitual insomnia have ample opportunity to be cured, so its effect is more than a hundred times that of sperm-strengthening tablets. Anyone who has taken various sperm-strengthening tablets on the market without success may wish to try this product, which guarantees a well-deserved effect.</p>

<p>Weakening of Fertility</p>
<p>In cases of acute and chronic gonorrhea-induced prostatitis, fertility is often reduced. This outcome is especially likely in cases of parenchymatous prostatitis. Gonorrheal inflammation affects a significant portion or the entirety of the prostate gland. It can cause high fevers exceeding 40 degrees Celsius, as well as extreme and frequent urges to urinate. Discomfort is experienced in the rectum during defecation or walking, and the perineum (the area between the anus and the scrotum) feels particularly tender. A hard, rough mass seems to obstruct the rectum. Sitting and standing become uneasy. If the inflammation spreads to the pelvic connective tissue, it can lead to thrombophlebitis, sepsis, and pyemia, posing a life-threatening risk.</p>
<p>The Only Effective Rescue</p>
<p>The most common manifestation is the cessation of prostatic secretion, which prevents the nourishment of sperm. Additionally, scar contracture during prostatitis can cause blockage of the testicular ducts, leading to infertility due to a lack of reproductive capacity. The only appropriate and effective treatment for this condition involves the internal administration of the gonorrhea-specific medication "Kelinong," combined with German static electricity therapy and B-type prostate massage, which are highly effective. Based on my years of accurate research, when the aforementioned parenchymatous prostatitis occurs, taking "Kelinong" can induce an anti-gonorrheal effect, directly targeting the prostate lesion, encapsulating it, and preventing the spread of gonorrhea. Simultaneously, using German static electricity and X-ray electrotherapy to enhance the bactericidal power of the medication can invariably achieve analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and diuretic effects in about four weeks. Moreover, it can completely cure the condition and restore the original function of prostatic fluid secretion. This has been repeatedly tested and proven effective by me over the past decade. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 consultation slots will be available daily, with a registration fee of only 5 jiao per slot.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Supporting Character's Complaints <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Mr. Xiaoyu</p>
<p>In the past few days, on the international stage of the Asia Grand Theatre, just as the "China" and "Japan" troupes were putting on a continuous performance of martial arts scenes, two rather famous supporting characters were suddenly dismissed. It's quite strange that both of these supporting characters have names that include the character "Wei." Normally, elder male characters should be the leads, but they were singing in action plays, so it's understandable that elder male characters would be relegated to supporting roles!</p>
<p>The departure of the elder male character from the "China" troupe was due to jealousy. He didn't like hearing the applause for the leading martial arts actor. He insisted on singing a few high-pitched lines in a loud voice while the lead actor was turning his horse and performing the "dragging sword" trick. The stage musicians had to frantically bang the gongs and drums to create momentum and play the erhu to support his singing, but the sound of the erhu couldn't drown out the gongs, and no one in the audience listened to his "chicken eating from the pot, duck sticking its beak in" high-pitched singing. He finally left in a fit of anger.</p>
<p>The elder male character from the "Japan" troupe tried his best to please the lead actor. He would roll his eyes and stroke his beard to cheer on the lead actor when he was wildly twirling his spear. He would even carry the spear and lead the horse when the lead actor came on stage. It's just a pity that his parents didn't give him three heads and six arms to properly serve these lead actors with their quirky temperaments. He finally retreated knowing that he was "acting with a stone mortar on his head" (doing something difficult). He failed because he lacked ability!</p>
<p>But supporting characters are, after all, supporting characters. If a supporting character performs well, it certainly adds to the excitement, but their departure doesn't affect the overall situation. As long as the lead actors don't remove their official hats, the signature performance won't stop. Don't you see that a new group of lead actors has already been announced, and others have already taken over the singing?</p>
<h3 id="e137">Starting with the Centenarian Ma Xiangbo <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Xinan</p>
<p>The reports in the newspapers these days about Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday are truly a cause for celebration for this national treasure. Especially since Elder Ma is a pioneer of the revolution and a forerunner of culture, and he still advocates for resistance at the age of 100, this is a sign of his noble character. Nowadays, young people often use age to determine whether someone is old and corrupt, but this is a childish perspective. In reality, whether someone is corrupt or not should not be judged by their age but by their actions. If young people indulge in pleasure, wealth, and material gain, and succumb to the philosophy of bowing down to anyone with power, ignoring everything else and engaging in opportunistic, shameless, despicable, and sordid behavior, it cannot be said that they are not corrupt. We should remember General Ma Yuan, the "vigorous old man," who was still able to travel across mountains and rivers to quell the south at an advanced age. And look at the old General Huang Zhong in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, what spirit he had! Therefore, Wang Bo said, "The older one gets, the stronger one should become, not knowing the heart of old age; the poorer one gets, the firmer one should become, not abandoning the ambition of youth." This is precisely what modern youth should learn from and emulate!</p>
<p>Speaking of Elder Ma Xiangbo's birthday, he was born on the 16th day of the third month of the Gengzi year of Daoguang (1840), which is April according to the Western calendar. So, in this year of the Republic of China, he is indeed a centenarian.</p>
<p>However, according to an old Chinese method of calculating age, Elder Ma is more than 100 years old this year. This method is used by people who are already over 90 years old and want to celebrate their 100th birthday early. They calculate each year as 12 months and then add the extra months to their age, which allows them to celebrate their 100th birthday a year or two early. According to this method, Elder Ma has had the following leap months until last year (the 27th year of the Republic):</p>
<p>Leap Second Month 4 Leap Third Month 5</p>
<p>Leap Fourth Month 5 Leap Ninth Month 10</p>
<p>Leap Sixth Month 4 Leap Seventh Month 5</p>
<p>Leap Eighth Month 3 Leap Tenth Month 1</p>
<p>Total 37 So, if we calculate each year as 12 months and add the 37 leap months, that's an extra 3 years and 1 month. Wouldn't that make him 103 years old this year? However, this kind of calculation is not valid, and Elder Ma, being a scientifically minded person, would certainly not resort to such tricks!</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, not much attention has been paid to cultivating good customs among the people. We should know that respecting the elderly is not only a valuable expression of respect but also an encouragement for people to take good care of their health and increase their lifespan, which is a sign of a healthy and strong nation. Therefore, past dynasties have always had measures to respect the elderly and care for the young. Without going too far back, during the Qing Dynasty, those who lived to be 100 years old were given a "Centenarian Archway" to honor them, and they were also given 30 taels of silver to build the archway. In the fourth year of Yongzheng (July), Xiao Junde, a resident of Qi County in Henan, reached the age of 118. Yongzheng doubled the amount of silver given to him to build the archway. He also established a precedent: for those who reach 110 years of age, the silver is doubled; for those who reach 120 years of age, it is doubled again; and for those who live even longer, the amount is doubled according to their lifespan. In that same year, the Ministry of Revenue reported that 1,421,625 people in the provinces directly under the control of the central government were over 70 years old, and some were over 100 years old. According to the population ratio at that time, the proportion of older people was one-twentieth! It is conceivable that people's lifespans at that time were much longer than they are today.</p>
<p>The most remarkable sign of longevity was an event in the second month of the twelfth year of Yongzheng, when an entire family was honored for their old age. A father and his five sons had a combined age of 503 years. This was the family of Xing Dengyun from Xingning County in Guangdong Province. He himself was 102 years old, his eldest son Xing Boda was 82 years old, his second son Xing Boyu was 80 years old, his third son Xing Bojin was 78 years old, his fourth son Xing Bowang was 74 years old, and his fifth son Xing Jiabin was 67 years old. The father enjoyed a long life, and his five sons also enjoyed long lives. What a family of longevity!</p>
<p>I also saw that Ma Xiangbo's two nephews, one of whom is Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, is 77 years old this year. The way he walks and writes makes it hard to believe that he is an old man nearing eighty. He is still vigorous and spirited, not hunchbacked, and his feet do not falter. He has the spirit of the old hero Chu Biao. His younger brother, Mr. Zhu Jilin, is 66 years old this year and still has a graceful demeanor, not diminished from his younger days, and still looks like he is in his forties. These are all signs of longevity, and their lifespans will not be less than their uncle's!</p>

<h3 id="e138">Tangled Affections <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>“There Goes My Heart” Produced by United Artists, Starring Fredric March</p>
<p>Rather than calling "Tangled Affections" a "comedy," it's more accurately described as a farce. A young woman whose grandfather treats her like a "priceless treasure," leaving her with no freedom of action, finally takes a trip to New York. After disembarking and "wandering aimlessly, suffering from hunger and thirst," she meets Bridget, a department store saleswoman, and also "enters the service of the store." Encouraging noble young ladies to leave their homes and experience real life by working in a department store is certainly not a bad thing. However, the theme of "Tangled Affections" does not lie here. It uses this opportunity to entangle the "affections" of the female protagonist with a newspaper reporter, thus unfolding a grand "comedy" of entangled affections.</p>
<p>This typical Hollywood-style story is not presented in a Hollywood-ized way. Perhaps this style is quite suitable for the palates of general foreign gentlemen and ladies, but for Chinese audiences, this is not the best way to perform.</p>
<p>Director Norman Z. McLeod certainly employed many so-called "gags," such as Bill mistakenly identifying Joan's maid when he goes to the yacht to photograph her; the introduction of Bridget's character by interspersing a quarrel between her and the restaurant manager; Joan's awkwardness when serving customers in the department store; the kiss between Bridget and her lover, and the humor in that complicated name; Bill's secret photography of Joan, which never captures her true face... and finally, the union of Bill and Joan on the sandy island. These gags still require the assistance of "dialogue," but the director fails to handle the development of the entire play in a very light and lively way. The "gags" are just "gags." In comparison, the final scene is more commendable.</p>
<p>Fredric March is a versatile actor. He has played "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "Resurrection," "The Buccaneer," and "Les Miserables." He can grasp the personalities of various different roles and bring his refined acting skills into play. However, the reporter Bill he portrays here simply cannot be developed. This is related to both the script and the director. Similarly, Virginia Bruce is also mediocre.</p>
<p>Patsy Kelly, who plays Bridget, is as interesting as Joan Davis in "Thirteen O'Clock." She is a lovable clown.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The female doctor's surname was Zhang, her name was Zhang Wenqi. She was an old maid who vowed to remain chaste. She was a devout Christian and also a missionary who dedicated herself to saving people and helping those in need. Knowing Zhu Laoyuan's character, she agreed to help him. She examined Zhu Laoyuan's granddaughter and, despite being a village girl, she was clean, tidy, and clever. She was only seven or eight years old, but she answered all her questions well. Because Zhu Laoyuan only had this granddaughter, he had taught her to read, and she had already read two or three primary school textbooks. When she first arrived, she inevitably cried and missed her home, but after Dr. Zhang coaxed her, she quickly became accustomed to her new surroundings, as she was just a child. Dr. Zhang ran a women's and children's hospital, which focused primarily on obstetrics and pediatrics. In the past, Chinese midwifery relied on uneducated old women, and countless infants died unnecessarily each year, especially in rural and poor areas. Later, obstetricians and midwives gradually emerged in China, but they were mostly located in major cities and charged exorbitant fees. Remote areas had no such services. Although Dr. Zhang's women's and children's hospital was located in a large town, it was surrounded by numerous villages. Secondly, there was pediatrics. Obstetrics and pediatrics were inherently related, but their pediatrics department was more specialized and serious, with dedicated pediatricians in charge. Since the outbreak of the war, many people had fled their homes. Among these refugees, many pregnant women were nearing their delivery dates, and giving birth at this time was extremely difficult. Dr. Zhang then established a refugee maternity hospital to help these women in labor. After giving birth, some women were unable to raise their infants and abandoned them at the hospital. What could be done? Therefore, Dr. Zhang had no choice but to establish an orphanage to house these abandoned and orphaned children. Naturally, Dr. Zhang's financial resources alone were insufficient, but fortunately, many people helped. People are emotional beings, except for those who have a policy of brutal aggression. As long as your cause is righteous, everyone will be willing to lend a hand. Therefore, Dr. Zhang was able to manage financially, thanks to her enthusiasm and efforts, which earned her the support of both Chinese and foreigners. It was not easy for a woman to achieve so much.

<p>Supplementary Information on Shanghai Pictorial</p>
<p>The "Xinwen Bao" also published a pictorial, which began in the 19th year of Guangxu (1893) in November. The format was a single-page book, attached to the newspaper as a supplement. It was published monthly, with a separate table of contents. It is unknown how long it lasted. One copy I have seems to be the second issue, titled "Catalogue of Pictorials of the Xinwen Bao Newspaper." It begins with a preface by the former owner of Cangshan:</p>
<p>"The pictorial originated in the West. It is not merely for pleasing the eye, gratifying the heart, boasting of oddities, or showing off rarities. For every event, it is drawn and painted, which can increase people's knowledge. For every object, it is copied and imitated, which can aid people's research. Because there are things and objects in the human world that cannot be fully conveyed by language and words, it relies on this painting to express the shape and appearance to the fullest extent, in order to show it to everyone. Moreover, in modern times, the five continents and ten thousand countries are united as one family. Strange events and bizarre objects change rapidly and emerge endlessly. Without pictorials to supplement the omissions of daily newspapers, it would be insufficient to be called complete. Therefore, this newspaper also follows this idea. Starting from the first day of the midwinter month of Gui Si, we invite famous artists every day to carefully draw and paint, attaching two pictorials to the newspaper every day, in addition to the newspaper, to broaden the appreciation of readers. Every week of the month, it becomes a book, which can increase current knowledge and provide material for aspiring imitators. I hope that you do not view it as a plaything that undermines ambition."</p>
<p>"This was the motive of the "Xinwen Bao" for publishing pictorials at that time. Unfortunately, the content of the pictorials, in essence, did not live up to the claims in the preface. The selected events were still nothing more than social trivia. Even so-called national events were never seen in the first issue. In total, the first issue contained 54 pictures, and at times it reflected extremely superstitious beliefs. Its contents were as follows:</p>
<p>The Gates of Heaven Open, the Palaces Appear, The Envoys of Ten Thousand Countries Bow to the Crown, New Year's Greetings, Starting to Read, Farmhouse Joy, Promotion to Office, Heavenly Fortune Opens, Welcoming Spring Picture, Beating Spring Picture, Welcoming the God of Wealth, Opening Market, Hosting Guests (all printed in red) The God of Wealth Enters a Dream, The Bodhisattva Comes Out to Greet, Phoenix Carriage Performance, Certificate Issuance Ritual, Foreign Tribes Alliance, Ten Thousand Miles Long Walk, Chickens in Pairs, Strange Crab with Double Umbilicus, Dragon Guest Breaks Through, Li Paste Mad Monk, Huge Honeycomb, Shark Eats Man, Digging for Gold, Telling of Oddities, Clever Woman Adapts, Royal Cudgel Scolds Excellent Servant, Hired Woman Rides Pig, Giant Stone Flies at Night, Sunny Day Dragon Gate (all printed in black) Blowing Ascends to Heaven, Lantern Moon on the Yuanxiao Festival (all printed in red)</p>
<p>This is the content of the first half of the first month of the following year (1894). Apart from complimenting the imperial court, saying auspicious things, and collecting strange and bizarre events, there was nothing of substance. The painting skills were also inferior to those of the Dianshizhai." Each picture occupied half a page. The length of the core of the page was 6.5 inches, and the width was 4 inches. The middle seam was titled "Xinwen Bao Newspaper Pictorial One." The date and page number were attached below. The note below the picture line stated "Single purchase of a pictorial picture costs 4 wen, single purchase of a book page costs 5 wen." According to this, it seems that the bound issues were printed separately. Besides these, there were also the initially printed issues attached to the newspaper. It is unknown what their format was like.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Film Industry in Nazi Germany <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Yuan</p>
<p>Since 1933, the German film industry has found itself in a precarious situation. Films shown domestically have had to sing the praises of the Third Reich and spread the spirit of National Socialism. If film companies want to make money, they have to market their films abroad, but many countries object to the ideas of National Socialism. In 1931, Germany exported films worth a total of 59 million marks. By 1937, after the "elimination of film industry saboteurs," the export of films was worth only 7.2 million marks. The decline of the National Socialist film industry goes without saying, and the quality of German films has also declined.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the decline in the quality of German films is the expulsion of countless of the most outstanding filmmakers, directors, playwrights, and stars. The most progressive comedy star, Grünbaum, and several other Austrian film artists were imprisoned in concentration camps.</p>
<p>Not all of the films produced in Germany are nationalistic and militaristic. Several years ago, Germany began producing short opera films, and since 1933, there has been a trend of producing short song and dance films. The artist Hinzl raised the quality of these films. It cannot be denied that Germany has produced lovely musical plays under the new regime. However, Hinzl has now also left Germany and gone to Hollywood. The second reason for the unhealthy state of German films is the increasing political censorship and official restrictions. The number of orders and bans on German films is now so great that no one knows them all completely.</p>
<p>The third reason is more profound. Originally, German psychological and realistic films often showed their strength. German films were the first to create the characteristics of producing films with literary, psychological, and social themes. However, now these films cannot be produced either. The Third Reich cannot discuss serious social problems, and psychological themes are only allowed to be produced within strict limits.</p>
<p>Today, the spirit of cruel militarism has invaded German films, as well as many novels and short stories. But not every film has overt political propaganda. The Bavaria film studios are still shooting detective and adventure stories, but a strange phenomenon can be observed: the plots of these films are all set in other countries. Assassination, theft, violence, and merciless villains are indispensable elements in the exciting plots. But official decrees say that Germany no longer has such assassinations, which is considered fortunate. Filmmakers can use England, France, the United States, or other countries as backgrounds for filming these films. For example, several films scheduled to be produced in 1939 will use Alaska, Chile, Africa, Norway, and the United States as backgrounds. Only Japan and Italy are not used as backgrounds for wrongdoing and dens of villains. Japan and Germany have close cooperation regarding films. The film "Woman of the Samurai Path," directed by the German Dr. Finke, is the first film jointly produced by Japan and Germany. Japanese films are shown everywhere in Germany, such as "The Power of Japan" directed by Herslu, and "The Devil's Hand" produced by the German-Japanese Joint Film Company. The German government is also gradually persuading Japan to reduce the import of foreign films so that more German and Italian films can be shown. Germany and Italy are also cooperating in film production, and three major films are scheduled to be co-produced next year. National Socialist propaganda films are shown everywhere in Germany, and a film called "The Sword of Peace" is also being prepared. The content depicts "the class struggle of the Bolsheviks in other countries leading to bloody disturbances," while on the other hand, it depicts "Germany's efforts for peace."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Casual Talk About Yangzhou Opera <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Baixiang</p>
<p>Yangzhou has been prosperous since ancient times and is a place where outstanding people and outstanding talents live. Not to mention anything else, but taking the artists in the entertainment industry in recent times as an example, like the famous Shisan Dan and Mei Lanfang, the king of the opera world, both belong to the Liuyang city walls. Drama has a long and considerable history in Yangzhou.</p>
<p>Yangzhou opera originally had no scripts. The performers had no teachers, no traditions, no standards, and no rules. They sang impromptu, creating their own tunes. This artistic talent is truly divine and breathtaking. Later, those who promoted Yangzhou opera organized troupes, invited actors, selected talents, compiled scripts, and added costumes. Thus, Yangzhou opera roughly took shape and gained a status.</p>
<p>The Yangzhou operas in various entertainment venues in this city have undergone several reforms and are now standing on the frontline of artisticization. Speaking of its achievements, in the impression of the general public, there are also many welcoming praises. If it continues to improve tirelessly in the future, it can easily stand alongside Suzhou's Tanhuang and Siming's Wenci. However, people in Shanghai mostly regard Yangzhou opera as a type of civilized opera. Their feeling of interest in the plot and lyrics is unlike that of watching civilized opera, nor is it as easy to understand. Therefore, the development potential of Yangzhou opera is more suitable in northern Tianjin than in southern Suzhou and Hangzhou, because Yangzhou dialect and northern accents are relatively close. The bamboo used in Yangzhou opera is unique to the region. There are sheng, xiao, dizi, huqin, zheng pi, and gongs and drums. Using various instruments at once, high and low, fast and slow, in moderation and pleasing to the ear, this advantage is indeed a unique characteristic of Weiyang, which is difficult to hear elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Gengchun Qushe Charity Performance <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Gengchun Qushe performed at the Carlton Grand Theatre the day before yesterday to raise money for refugees. Since Xianni She captured a part of the audience at the Dongfang Theatre, Kunqu opera has gradually occupied a good position in the theater world, so yesterday's performance did not disappoint the organizers.</p>
<p>At a little after one o'clock, the theater was almost full. When I entered the theater, a purple velvet backdrop was hanging on the stage, with the two yellow seal characters "Gengchun" embroidered in the middle, It probably hasn't been long since the opening performance, and they were still dancing the Jiao Guan there.</p>
<p>Inside the theater, I discovered many actors, such as Wang Xichun, Yu Suling, Liu Binkun, etc. She and they were studying Kunqu opera. This was an opportunity for them to observe and learn. After the Jiao Guan dance was over, the entire Tieguan Tu began. The first act was Chen Baoqian's Borrowing Military Funds. His hair was already gray, but in order to participate in this charity performance, he specially shaved off his well-maintained beard. Next was Sun Junqing and Xu Lingyun's Bimu Lanjian. Junqing is a famous performer of Tanhuang. Only then did I know that he was also proficient in Kunqu opera. Lingyun played Zhou Yuji's mother, and her singing and acting were very enthusiastic. Her right arm ached as a result. The ghost scene was played by someone else. Tieguan Tu was performed until Assassinating the Tiger. The next acts were Su Huan Ji Xiao Yan and Shizi Hou Gui Chi. It was already past six o'clock when the performance ended.</p>
<p>The troupe was borrowed from Xianni She. I met a senior, Shi Guilin, backstage. He is the father of the late famous Kunqu actor Shi Chuanzhen (this person should be an old man in the middle, and he and Kirin Tong are the most close friends. Qilin's research on Kunqu opera benefited greatly from him. He has been in Nanjing and only came to Shanghai after the war. He joined Xianni She and also teaches opera. Wang Xichun, Jin Suwen, Zhang Huicong, Yu Suling, Ge Cijiang, Wang Lanfang, etc., all studied with him. I was very satisfied after watching the play. I felt that although Kunqu opera is not popular, it is not in danger of declining.</p>
<p>News in Brief The "Banyue Xiju" New Year's issue, edited by the Plum Blossom Hall Master and published by the Banyue Xiju Publishing House, was published today. The content is richer than before. The cover is a photo of Li Yuru and Yuan Shihai in the play "Qingmei Zhujiu Lun Yingxiong." The copperplate photos include stage photos of Sun Juxian, Xia Yuerun, Shang Heyu, Yu Shuyan, Meng Xiaodong, Li Shaochun, Zhang Eyun, Wang Xichun, Yao Shuijuan, etc. There are more than ten articles of commentary. The general distribution address is No. 10, Lane 422, Jin Shenfu Road.</p>

<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Last year, there were quite a few trivial matters in the world of opera worth mentioning. I have, as best as I can remember, selected four topics: Hiding, Accusing, Bidding, and Writing, and will now describe them as follows:</p>
<p>Hiding The female Kunqu opera performer Meng Xiaodong, with her clear and moving voice and accomplished acting, often performed in Ping Opera. As soon as posters were put up for plays like "Losing Weiting" and "Releasing Zhu Lianhan," they immediately caused a sensation in the windy city [Beijing]. Last spring, due to a sore throat, she stopped performing and immediately became disheartened with her singing and dancing career. She went with other women from the former capital to a certain temple, where she chanted scriptures and worshipped Buddha, virtually becoming a nun. Meng Xiaodong is in her prime, and this sudden turn to negativity, like Hao Shouchun's abrupt retirement, is an unfortunate event for the opera world last year.</p>
<p>Accusing The "Little Bird" Wang Xichun, a Qin opera actress, plunged into the world of Kunqu opera and surprisingly became an overnight sensation, gaining fame from Beijing to Wuhan. Last year, she came to the isolated island [Shanghai] and, after performing at the Eden Theatre, received even greater praise. In the autumn, she suddenly accused a certain theater newspaper in court of defamation. In court, she spoke at length about the issue of "tight or loose waistband of her trousers," which was widely reported in the newspapers at the time. This, along with the incident of Mao Jianqiu and Wang Zhuangbai's over-realistic performance involving the breast, which sparked a newspaper war, created a scandal for the theatrical world last year.</p>
<p>Bidding Jin Youqin is an outstanding second-tier female opera performer. Her stage presence is quite graceful. Jin Shaobao, the "Old Man of the Melon Garden" from Shanghai, strongly promoted her, even giving her his residence, renamed "Qin Lou." Last summer, on Jin Shaobao's sixtieth birthday, a few close friends held a banquet at Qin Lou to celebrate, decorating the place with large "longevity" characters made of jasmine flowers, which were given to his concubine and Jin Youqin. After the banquet, a group photo was taken, called "Bidding Gold Picture." The romantic tale spread and was much talked about. Meanwhile, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Cheng Yanqiu and others busily took in disciples, so those making the pilgrimage to former capital to become apprentices came one after another. All of this was truly a wonderful activity in the opera world last year.</p>
<p>Writing It is common to see calligraphy by opera performers in newspapers and magazines, but the one with the most scholarly air is undoubtedly Shi Huiru. Last month, at the "Old Opera Performers' Reunion" initiated by Shang Xiaoyun, He Heyu, Cheng Jixian, Xiao Changhua, Wang Fulian, and Shi Huiru, five veteran opera performers from Tianjin, Shi Huiru performed various plays, all being young male roles. Opera fans said he wrote the four characters "Wishing You Health and Peace" on the spot, with powerful strokes and well-chosen words. Compared to Lin Shusen writing "606" when performing as a fan, one is elegant, and the other is vulgar, clearly showing a difference in taste!</p>

<h3 id="e146">Tang Shengming's Telegram Arrives in Shanghai: Xu Lai is Safe and Sound in Changde; Sha Lu and Mingchun May Return to Shanghai <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the incident of "Standard Beauty Xu Lai's Plane Crash Injuring Her Foot," which was widely circulated a week ago, the Gu Bao newspaper successively published the news. However, the reporter, having never heard of Tang Shengming owning a private plane, was quite doubtful and once visited Cao Yinyun, a close friend of Tang Shengming in Shanghai. Cao confirmed two points: First, Tang Shengming indeed did not have a private plane; second, Tang is currently the Garrison Commander of Changde and is not in Chongqing, which contradicts what was reported in the newspaper. He also asked Cao to send a telegram to Changde to inquire about the truth and wrote an article titled "Xu Lai's Plane Crash: Two Points of Suspicion," which was published in the last edition of this newspaper on the 31st of last month. Now, Tang Shengming's reply telegram has arrived in Shanghai and was shown by Cao Yinyun. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Lai is in Changde and is unharmed. Mingchun may return to Shanghai. Ji, Dong. The telegram ends with the signature "Ji," which is Tang Shengming's courtesy name (his elder brother is Tang Shengzhi, courtesy name Mengxiao). Judging from this telegram, it can be confirmed that Xu Lai is indeed in Changde, safe and sound, and the story of the plane crash injuring her foot is undoubtedly a misreport.</p>
<h3 id="e147">New Talk from the Opera Stage <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>The Standard Opera Troupe organized by Gu Wuwei and Lu Cuilan, husband and wife, has not been successful in southern China and has now disbanded. Gu came to Shanghai a few days ago to seek a new base. It is said that he has reached an agreement with the Gengxin Stage, where Gu will join as a shareholder and be in charge of backstage scenery, while Lu Cuilan and others will perform on stage and receive separate performance fees from the front-of-house management. The rumor that Gu Wuwei has taken over the Gengxin Stage is not true.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, the leading martial arts actor of the Great Stage, has been performing "Journey to the West" at the theater for several years. As his contract is about to expire, he will leave when the theater closes at the end of the lunar year. The management of the Great Stage has been trying to persuade him to stay, but the decision has not been made yet. After leaving, Zhang Yipeng is determined to form his own opera troupe. It is said that he has been in contact with the Amon Grand Theatre in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Since hiring Feng Zihe as a screenwriter, the first work of the Golden Grand Theatre was the full-length "Good Sisters," which was a great success. The second work, "Xu Huiniang," is adapted from a section of "The Green Wilderness" and is even more brilliant than "Good Sisters." It will be rehearsed as soon as the script is finished. "Chu Overlord," which is being performed tonight (8th), is also adapted by Feng and is very different from the old play "Farewell My Concubine." Jin Suqin plays Yu Ji, Cheng Shaoyu plays the Overlord, and Li Junyu plays Han Xin.</p>
<p>For the sake of further artistic refinement, Yu Suyun will study opera with Chen Tongyun.</p>
<p>The Era Theater will stop performing on the 18th of this month and close for five days to renovate the interior before reopening. On the 18th night, there will be a cross-dressing performance, with the male impersonator Lao Niu Zhang Wenjuan playing Zhang Guilan, and the female impersonator Jiang Yunxia playing Huang Tianba. The management of the backstage has been taken over by Shen Jitang and Zhang Liansheng, Wenjuan's father, as partners. Except for Jiang Yunxia, who has left, the other performers remain the same. They are currently looking for suitable talent to replace her and are also hiring new performers to strengthen the lineup.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Notes on Kunqu Opera Actress Wang Huichan <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Master of Songfeng Shuiyue Lodge</p>
<p>Kunqu opera actress Wang Huichan is the daughter of the famous zither teacher Mr. Bo Shui. Coming from a family of scholars, she is skilled in many plays. She studied under famous opera performers such as Wang Yaoqing and was highly praised as a rising star. Last year, she occasionally performed as a guest in a charity performance, surprising the audience with her talent and beauty and winning their applause. However, Huichan was flattered and became even more modest, studying hard behind closed doors to deepen her skills. Recently, she responded to the invitation of the owner of Gengxin Theatre, and all the contract terms were agreed upon, but suddenly due to a minor misunderstanding, an agreement could not be reached and the matter was dropped. Another theater happened to be reorganizing and planning to revive Ping opera, so through the introduction of Lin Shusen, Ms. Wang was hired as the leading performer. She made her debut on New Year's Eve of last year. Her specialty plays, such as "Lian Jinfeng" and "Yutangchun," are all her proud masterpieces. In recent years, I have become lazy and have not set foot in the theater for a long time. On New Year's Day evening, I was invited by my old friend Mr. Ma Li to watch. After returning, I felt moved and composed a poem to praise her:</p>
<p>"Rare to find both talent and beauty,</p>
<p>Her first appearance on stage captivates all.</p>
<p>Indeed, her family background contributes,</p>
<p>Truly, her artistry reaches perfection.</p>
<p>Her interpretation of the play is nuanced and steady,</p>
<p>Her new melodies clear and distinct.</p>
<p>I too, as a周..."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Rejecting Students' Dancing <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Gonghe</p>
<p>At a time when the nation is about to stake everything to fight for the final victory, dancing is undoubtedly an improper activity. However, the dance industry on this isolated island, although it once declined when the War of Resistance broke out, has now seen a perverted development. It is indeed something to be lamented. However, it is still excusable for those who have established families and careers to dance and relax. Students, however, are the future masters of the country. If they indulge in pleasure during their student years, their studies will inevitably become worthless, and their future will be bleak forever! Therefore, this should be most strictly avoided.</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Peiying, although she is currently a dance hostess at the Guotai Ballroom, deeply understands this principle. She is not as focused on money as other dance hostesses. When students ask her to dance, she always politely refuses. Recently, she even used a stern attitude to prevent a certain student from becoming her patron. Here is a record of the incident:</p>
<p>A student from ×× Middle School asked Ms. Wang to dance for the first time. She responded coldly, telling him that students should bury themselves in books and not indulge in pleasure. Who knew that this gentleman was shameless and continued to bother her repeatedly, forcing her to use a stern tone and severely scold him as a second step, and then avoid meeting him as a third step. Under her resolute will, the gentleman finally left in frustration.</p>
<p>I believe her attitude deserves praise. And I hope that all the dance stars in the dance world can follow Ms. Wang's example. In this way, even if there are some students who are willing to degenerate, they will have no way to do so. The sin of dancing can be reduced a lot by this.</p>

<p>Since its restoration, Yi Hua has released three films. "Records of the Film City," directed by Chen Kengran, is 80% complete; "Bi Xue Dan Xin" (Loyal Blood and Devoted Heart), directed by Yue Feng, has also been completed; and "Chu Overlord," directed by Wang Jielong, is being rushed day and night. The part of Yu Suqin has been temporarily postponed, as Yi Hua officials are considering Jin's relations with the Golden Grand Theatre. It is expected that the above films will be released successively during the Lunar New Year. The follow-up films will be "Mysterious Madam" by Wen Yimin and "Three-Part Incarnation Girl" by Fang Peilin, while "Daji," starring Diao Banhua, will be filmed at the same time.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of people who love film art in China, but it is not easy to make them rise to stardom and become shining stars. In the past, Lianhua worked hard to cultivate new talent. Since the rise of Yi Hua, the effort to cultivate new talent has been even greater. Yuan Meiyun, although enjoying a great reputation on the stage, owes her current status in the film industry in large part to Yi Hua. Others, such as Li Hong, Zhang Cuihong, and Lu Ming, were all created by Yi Hua. It is said that as Yi Hua begins its twenty-eighth year, the company's workload has increased, and it will work even harder to cultivate new talent. Yang Li and Yu Lin have already been given leading roles to help them progress. It is also planned to organize a new talent training class, with each director and actor responsible for their fees, so that those with aspirations can develop their talents. Readers of our newspaper who wish to serve in the film industry are welcome to apply.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Guang Speed Skating Rink; Compiled by Hanzhen (5) <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Types of Shoes</p>
<p>(B) Roller Skates: Purchase high-quality roller skates as well. Inferior roller skates have all four wheels fixed to the baseboard without any give. Superior skates have rubber pads. The ability of roller skates to move freely left and right depends entirely on these pads. Without them, the skates are no different from an ordinary four-wheeled cart, only suitable for moving straight ahead. The rubber pads on the front and rear wheels of both skates must be of the same thickness and softness. Otherwise, they cannot function properly. Rubber pads for roller skates vary from brand to brand. Therefore, it is difficult for those who use rental skates to show their skills. The length of the roller skates also depends on the height of the user. The distance from the center of the front wheel to the center of the rear wheel is five to seven inches for larger sizes. If the roller skates are nailed onto leather shoes, the roller skate sole should be one inch shorter than the leather shoe sole. Roller skates are more complex than ice skates. In addition to wiping them clean and adding oil, special attention must be paid to the condition of the four wheels to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>(C) Leather Shoes: Leather shoes must also be custom-made. If using bandages around the ankles, they must be worn when purchasing shoes to avoid the risk of the shoes being too small later on. The shoes must have flat heels. The shoelaces must start from near the throat of the shoe. Like ordinary sneakers, the shoe throat covering on the top of the leather shoe must not close when the shoelaces are tied. Because over time, the shoe throat covers on both sides of the top will gradually lengthen, they should be about an inch apart at first. The tongue of the shoe should be wide and able to cover the opening of the shoe throat. The shoe tongue should be multi-layered, with cotton padding or soft padding in the middle. The socks should be thicker than those worn normally.</p>
<p>Introduction for Beginners</p>
<p>Before entering the rink, beginners can practice various ice-skating-related exercises at home. If you have never practiced before and feel that your ankles are weak and unable to stand firmly on the thin blade of the ice skate, resulting in a lack of interest on your first visit to the rink, it is best to put on your ice skates at home and practice striding on a flat surface. The blades of the skates must be wrapped in cloth to avoid damaging the floor or carpet. Initially, the skates should not be tied too tightly. Tighten them slightly as you progress.</p>
<p>When first entering the rink, you will feel that the ice is slippery and difficult to walk on. As one foot tries to move forward, the other foot slides backward, making it difficult to move and creating a feeling of being unable to walk. This is because ice skating is fundamentally different from walking. Walking involves lifting one foot, moving it forward, and shifting the body's center of gravity behind that foot before lifting the other foot. Ice skating involves tilting the entire body forward from the first foot, allowing the second foot to push out and move on the ice. Then, the first foot is moved forward and lands, allowing the second foot to propel forward.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>When I lived in the former capital as a teenager, I heard Rong Zhifeng (Ronglu's nephew) talk about the bronze hammer that Xu Yanzhao held in the play "Er Jin Gong" (Xu Yanzhao made no great contributions to the royal family, so this hammer was probably a relic of King Zhongshan). It still exists in the world. Mr. Rong had seen it twice. It is said that this treasure is now kept in the home of a Mr. Xu in Dongjiaominxiang. This Mr. Xu is a descendant of Xu Yanzhao, and he held a high official position in the Qing Dynasty. His mansion also has a portrait of Xu Da, the founding hero of the Ming Dynasty, as well as many other relics. My ancestral home is Xuzhou, and I not only share the same surname as Xu Da, but he also served as a wise magistrate in my hometown. Ma Lianliang's newly arranged "String of Dragon Pearls" is a disguised version of "Xu Da Rebels Against Xuzhou." Because of the above reasons, I wanted to ask Mr. Rong to introduce me to the Xu mansion to appreciate these treasures. If I could get the owner's consent, I would also like to take some pictures and publish them in newspapers and books for the public to enjoy. That would be a very interesting thing. Later, because I went south in a hurry, I put this matter aside. Now, I feel very sorry about it and can only wait until I go north again in the future to complete this task.</p>
<p>When Duanfang first took office as Governor of Hubei, two of my fellow villagers served under him in that province. One was Huang Boyu, who had served as the Hubei Judicial Commissioner, and the other was Xu Hecheng, who was in his staff. According to these two, Duanfang was very fond of antiques and also very interested in opera. Later, when he acted as Governor-General of Huguang, he would gather famous opera performers to perform during the New Year holidays. Xia Yueheng, the elder brother of Xia Yuerun, even abandoned his career as an actor to become his martial arts constable, which shows how much he loved opera performers. Once, he obtained the wellhead into which Madam Mi threw herself in "Changbanpo." He was very proud of it, saying that this thing was very valuable to preserve. If there had been no well that buried the loyal and righteous Madam Mi, then Zhao Zilong, no matter how brave and invincible he was, would have died in the chaotic army. Imagine a million Cao soldiers trapping him at the heart of the battle, Zilong alone having to take care of both A Dou and the arrow-wounded Madam Mi. As a general, he had to give his warhorse to Madam Mi to ride, fight on foot, how could he possibly repel a million troops? As a result, the lives of these three people and a horse would have all died at the hands of Cao's soldiers. If Liu Bei had lost this ever-victorious general, then the banquet at the Yellow Crane Tower, the marriage proposal by Dong Wu, the interception of A Dou, and even the rescue of the camp and the retreat of Sima Yi by the empty city strategy, so many important and urgent events would not have had anyone else to handle and resolve. I am afraid that Liu Xuande would not have succeeded as King of Hanzhong, let alone be able to call himself emperor in Chengdu and share the world with Wei and Wu. Like Liu Chan, that little rascal, would not have been able to enjoy the glory of being a king for decades, messing things up with Huang Hao. From this point of view, the well in "Changbanpo" was indeed a treasure of Liu Bei and his son. Even Madam Mi's loyalty and Zhao Zilong's courage were all made possible by this well. Later, Duanfang was sent abroad as one of the five ministers. After returning to China, he was promoted to Governor-General of Liangjiang and brought the well to Nanjing. When he was transferred to Sichuan and killed on the way, the whereabouts of the wellhead became unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Finance: A Surge of Limit-Price Sellers; Cash Falls by Seven Yuan <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash futures market fluctuated greatly. The situation was still unstable. Initially, the price dropped by ten yuan because the price of British pure gold plummeted. Later, the price once approached the 2,000 yuan mark due to a sudden surge in buying interest from securities firms. However, due to the large number of sellers with a limit price of 2,000 yuan, coupled with a certain gold shop taking advantage of the high price to sell off, and the fact that securities firms such as De Fu and Jinbang were selling off their long positions, the market suddenly lacked buyers. The price then fell sharply, eventually dropping by seven yuan. The morale of the long position holders was shaken. Trading was relatively active, with around 500 taels traded in the morning. There was no trading in the afternoon. However, since the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on trading were discovered, jewelers have been uneasy and seem to be blocking news about market transactions, which is extremely unwise.</p>
<p>Cash Futures Eager to Sell</p>
<p>Since yesterday morning, the cash futures market has been very eager to sell off. Initially, the market was sideways due to the sudden sharp rise in the price of British pure gold. However, due to the eagerness of many to sell off, the price was lowered from 1,995 yuan to below 90 yuan. At 9:30, the Qian Dui firm entered the market and bought 50 taels from a gold shop at a price of 1,987 yuan, a drop of ten yuan from the previous day's price. Then, Ran Jin bought another 50 taels from a fellow firm at a price of 90 yuan (both said to be buying on behalf of Hong Kong firms). After that, Hong Kong firms entrusted a certain gold shop and a certain jeweler to absorb a large amount, causing the market to suddenly feel like demand exceeded supply. Therefore, the price rose sharply. A certain gold shop bought 50 taels from a cash shop on behalf of Hong Kong firms at a price of 95 yuan. A certain jeweler bought 50 taels from a fellow firm on behalf of Hong Kong firms at a price of 98 yuan, and another 50 taels from a fellow firm at a price of 99 yuan, which was the highest price. In between, sellers with a limit price of 2,000 yuan were enthusiastic, so the upward momentum stopped abruptly. Gold shops also suddenly came out to sell heavily, and securities firms also sold off their long positions at the same time. As a result, the underlying trend turned weak. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a fellow firm at a price of 96 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 95 yuan, and another 50 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 93 yuan. A gold shop also sold 40 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 92.5 yuan, and another 50 taels to a Qian Dui firm at a price of 92 yuan. Finally, a Qian Dui firm did a mutual transaction of 50 taels at a price of 91 yuan as the afternoon close. In the afternoon, because there was no foreign exchange market, morale was sluggish. It was heard that buyers were bidding 89 yuan, but there were no sellers, so there was no trading. Compared to the afternoon close, the price had fallen by six yuan. The cash shops were selling gold with their own brand for 2,000 yuan and buying it back for 1,985 yuan. The current gold standard price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was no trading.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Lowered by One Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jeweler's gold ornaments did not change. Later, it was heard that cash futures had weakened. At 10 am, the price was lowered by one yuan. Datonghang changed its listed price to 202 yuan, and Xintonghang changed its listed price to 200 yuan, buying back at 194 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Falls Even More Sharply</p>
<p>London, June 6th: Because the British pound rose sharply after being maintained, the price of British pure gold also continued to fall. The price fell sharply by seven shillings per ounce, reaching £7 9s 6d. The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold also fell to 1,222.05 yuan. The listed customs gold also fell sharply by one cent, reaching 2 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold standard price also fell by 4.7 yuan, reaching 1,215.7 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e156">International Exchange Rates Suddenly Surge; Foreign Exchange Rates Go from Loose to Tight; It All Depends on Supply and Demand <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a sudden surge in international exchange rates. The price of the pound against the pound rose sharply by 3.75, and the price of the dollar against the pound rose sharply by 2.8125, resulting in a situation where the pound was tight and the dollar was loose. However, the trend in the middle was first loose and then tight, depending largely on buying and selling. Initially, the market was loose due to foreign telegrams selling off. Then, Jardine Matheson, Asiatic Petroleum, and Japanese foreign firms rushed to buy in, and the bank's buying interest improved, leading to a tighter market. Trading was quite active in the morning.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large cable, both near and far, shrank. The New York spot market still had prices but no market. The London spot gold price shrank by seven shillings. The exchange rate of the pound against the dollar rose sharply by 3.75, the rate against the franc rose by 56 centimes, and the rate against Shanghai was flat. The price of the dollar against the pound rose sharply by 2.8125, the rate against the franc rose by one cent, and the rate against Shanghai rose by five cents. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's early spot selling prices were 8 pence 515625 for the pound and 16.59375 yuan for the dollar, which was 0.015625 tighter for the pound and 0.09375 cheaper for the dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, the bank's buying interest was thin, and there were many telegrams pouring in from Hong Kong, Manila, and other places, causing the capital position to be too much in excess of demand for a time. Therefore, the underlying trend gradually loosened. The pound could be settled at 8 pence 53125, and the dollar at 16.625 yuan. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed price was announced, it remained flat. When the silver equalization tax was announced, it continued to fall by 75. After that, the situation gradually tightened due to the sudden surge in buying interest from Western firm Jardine Matheson, coupled with the strong buying interest from Japanese banks, and the sudden increase in settlements by Asiatic Petroleum. Moreover, banks were unwilling to sell at low prices. The bank's buying price was 16.5625 yuan for the dollar, and it was difficult to settle the pound at 8 pence and a half. Near noon, foreign telegrams became active in selling off, causing the market to return to flat. At the afternoon close, the pound was at 8 pence and a half, and the dollar was at 16.53125 yuan, with the pound being 0.03125 tighter and the dollar being 0.03125 stronger compared to the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. Below are the details of the transactions that took place during the half day:</p>
<h3 id="e157">Less Demand for Cash; Discount Rate Falls Close to the 30 Yuan Mark <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange fell sharply. This was mainly because the Lunar New Year holidays were over, the demand for cash was less, and the stability of the financial system was more obvious. Speculators had nothing to speculate on and released funds, causing the price per 1,000 yuan to fall close to the 30 yuan mark. There were still few who discounted cash. In the early morning, the price was low at 38 yuan. It soon fell step by step, reaching only 33 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the market felt even more unsustainable and fell further to 30.05 yuan. Finally, due to some discount buying at a low price, the price rose back to 32.5 yuan, but it was still more than 6 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Large Cables Show Mixed Fluctuations <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>London, June 6th: Speculators bought long-term contracts, but there were very few suppliers. The silver market was still flat. The closing price was also flat. The near-term price of large cable silver continued to shrink by 125, while the far-term price returned to the highest point of 1875. New York Silver Cables: The price of American silver still had prices but no market. Bombay Silver Cables: The spot price of Indian silver continued to shrink by four annas, the near-term price shrank by five annas, and the far-term price also shrank by four annas.</p>
<h3 id="e159">England Continues Gold Trading; Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Decline <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British pure order continued to fall by seven shillings, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 2.75. Because the Bank of England restricted foreign currency and gold trading in order to maintain the pound's parity, the price of pure gold fell sharply. Speculators, after this crackdown, feared that the price of pure gold would continue to fall and that it would be difficult to rise. This measure is very beneficial to our country's financial future. Because after the price of gold rose, people hoarded cash, which hindered the promotion of legal tender and the prohibition of nationalization of gold. Moreover, some parties intentionally destroyed legal tender and sought private gain. Although foreign exchange rates were released due to foreign telegrams, banks' buying interest was still strong. The trend was that the pound was tight and the dollar was loose. Cash futures were occasionally collected by Guangdong firms, but retail sales were continuous, so the fluctuations were still small. As the price of gold fell, the foreign currency rate tended to decline slightly. There were very few transactions in the guild. Only Bao Cheng sold US dollar drafts for 1,000 yuan to Tong Feng. Yesterday's market prices were: the British gold pound fell by 3 jiao, the British gold draft fell by 5 fen, the American gold pound fell by 4 jiao, the American gold draft fell by 1 fen and 5 li, the French franc draft fell by 1 li, the Singapore dollar draft fell by 1 fen, and the rupee draft fell by 1 fen. Other currencies did not change.</p>

<p>The informal securities market saw a quiet day yesterday. Most operators were taking a wait-and-see approach, awaiting developments in the situation. Buying and selling were not active. Rumors circulated that the new Japanese cabinet's policy toward China would follow the old Konoestyle, causing increased uncertainty. However, due to the extremely low interest in foreign exchange arbitrage, many capitalists were shifting their focus to investing in government bonds. Any slight new development in the environment would surely attract a large number of investors. Yesterday morning, Tien Seng and Tung Kong were mostly buyers, while Shieh Dah was the only seller, leading to price discrepancies due to differing approaches. In the afternoon, Number Eleven was buying, while Number Forty-Six was selling, causing a slight rebound in market prices. Due to the weekend, afternoon trading was extremely light, with total transactions estimated at no more than 400,000 yuan. As a result, market prices rebounded by 2 to 4 jiao. A brief table is provided below.</p>
<p>Regarding stock market prices, 200 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded yesterday, with 100 shares at 35 yuan 8 jiao and another 100 shares at 36 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. There were no other transactions. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, since its reorganization the year before last, has had a strong capital base and a thriving business. After August 13th, it suffered a sudden blow, and the losses were also very large. The Hong Kong and Guangdong regions were greatly affected. However, last year, the company's management made every effort to reorganize. In the abnormal development of this city, sales were huge, mainly inland sales. With the fall of Hankou, the company relocated, so the sales and profits in Yunnan and other places have become the company's mainstay. It is said that the total profit for the 27th year reached as high as two million several hundred thousand yuan. If it can continue to develop this year, there is hope that the stock will pay dividends.</p>
<p>Chung Wo Industrial Co., Ltd. convened a board meeting the day before yesterday to review the account books for last year (1938) and discuss the distribution plan. The plan will be implemented after it is submitted to the sixth shareholders' meeting on the 23rd of this month for approval. The company's profit last year was 391,814.27 yuan in national currency. Adding the 517,155.16 yuan in national currency carried over from the previous session, the total was 908,969.53 yuan in national currency. After deducting the 36,000.00 yuan in national currency for underwriting commissions for company bonds, a dividend of 1 fen 5 li per week will be distributed, totaling 270,000.00 yuan in national currency (based on a paid-up share capital of 1,800,000.00 yuan in national currency). The remaining 602,969.53 yuan in national currency will be carried over to the next session.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Debt: Market prices listed on the 6th of this month (Friday) were quiet. Only the Crisp Loan rebounded by half a pound, priced at 37 pounds. The rest remained flat. There was no telegraphic transfer of physical goods to Shanghai.</p>

<p>There was no improvement in spot flour trading yesterday. Customers were waiting and seeing. The Northern Gang, after making some purchases once the market opened, are currently shipping them. There are few new transactions. The Southern Gang is also just going through the motions. Total market transactions, excluding retail sales in this street, amounted to 8,000 bags. Customer sales were only slightly more than 10,000 bags. The mill's price for Number Two flour remained at 4 yuan 9 jiao. The market will have to wait until next week. As for exports, 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou today (the 8th).</p>
<p>There was not much wheat arriving yesterday. Only two to three thousand bags arrived by rail. Owners insisted on their prices, citing difficulties in shipping to Shanghai. Mills, on the other hand, were reluctant and intended to lower prices. As a result, the two sides found it difficult to reach an agreement, and transactions decreased sharply. The total market saw only 3,000 bags of wheat from North Jiangsu and Puchen sold, with Fuhsin Mill buying 2,000 bags and Fufeng Mill buying 1,000 bags. The highest price was 6 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen. The market remained stable. Another 1,300 bags of wheat arrived from Hsinking.</p>

<p>Yesterday, customer demand for high-grade Nanking rice was very strong. However, apart from rice from Wuhu, Nanking rice arrivals were becoming increasingly scarce. Yesterday, the price of high-grade Nanking rice in the big market reached 10 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. Special high-grade Chongbu rice was not available due to lack of stock. A small amount of stock was offered at 10 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen, but no transaction was made. High-grade Wuhu rice had also risen to 10 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen. A total of 1,500 bags were sold through customs, with prices rising by 7 to 8 fen to 1 jiao 5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, no national rice arrived from Hexia. Seven to eight thousand bags arrived this round, including 1,530 bags from Neihupu. Sales were brisk due to the approach of the winter storage period. Purchases by local merchants and hoarders were smooth. Sales of Baozi rice were also flourishing. The goods were sold out in an instant, and the prices continued to rise. As a result, thin Japonica rice all increased by 1 jiao. Sheyang Jian rice and Chongbu Jian rice also continued to rise by several fen, up to 1 jiao.</p>

After people were selling, the market was excited, and the prices, under the tight shout of the cargo owners, turned open Fuhsing factory large package price of two yuan eight jiao, five points higher than the previous market. In the afternoon, the rising wind was still not a little bit but also 5 points, for two yuan eight corners and a half to close still pretty. According to people in the industry, the three-yuan mark is just around the corner. Today, there are 2,000 bags of wheat bran shipped to Shantou and 5,300 bags to Hsinking.</p>

<p>Since the New York raw silk statistics were revealed, there was mention that last month's raw silk inventories increased by 7,000 piculs and consumption decreased by 6,400 piculs, so raw silk prices in both Japan and the United States are trending downward. The market situation has suddenly turned sluggish. Yesterday, only 20 piculs of factory silk were traded on the New York Exchange. According to Westerners in the Shanghai silk market, this year's Chefoo silk sales to the US may be significantly inferior, because last year, American people boycotted Japanese lower-grade raw silk, and purchased a large amount of Chinese white filature. However, the quality of Chefoo silk was not consistent last year, leading to an unfavorable impression among American users, which will affect this year's Chefoo silk exports. It is also said that this year's Shanghai 7-8 fen white filature silk can be quite prosperous, due to the impact of US anti-aggression and sympathy for China's war of resistance. Therefore, in terms of raw silk quality, it is hoped that Shanghai manufacturers will conscientiously be conservative and not follow the footsteps of last year's Chefoo silk. Yesterday in Shanghai, there were no transactions with American firms, and sales to England and France were still good. Dafeng, Kaili, Baiduo and other firms purchased a total of over 100 bundles of white filature, and the price increased by 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Yarn and Cotton: Over 20,000 Bales of Yao Yi Cotton Transacted; Selling Price Increased by Over One Yuan; Foreign Cotton Rarely Transacted Due to the Fixed Silver Issue; Overseas Market Conditions Soft Due to Excessive Cotton Inventory <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>White-baled cotton continues to dominate the cotton business. The reason is that most of the Indian cotton purchased by various mills is continuously arriving in Shanghai. It is difficult to make the yarn bright and unsuitable for customer sales if it is not mixed with bright white cotton. Therefore, it is the biggest reason for the competition among various mills to purchase it. Recently, the Tung Yih and Chung Hsin factories have been purchasing 10-count Dafah and Golden Rooster yarn from Yunnan and Shantou in large quantities, and the replenishment of this raw material is particularly strong. Therefore, a huge amount of Yao Yi cotton, totaling 21,000 bales, was purchased yesterday, with the price increasing by more than one yuan. Sixty-three and a half of which are replenishment prices. Shen Hsin Factory slightly needs fine velvet cotton, and also purchased 200 bales of Brazilian cotton, which are used for spinning 32-count raw materials, but Japanese factories still have no intention of activity, because they have been purchasing US and Indian cotton in large quantities for days, and they have absolutely no intention of touching the high-priced Chinese cotton, so the market atmosphere is also restrained by it, otherwise the rising power would be even better. The source is still scarce. Five hundred and ten bales of Changyinsha straw bales and seven hundred and seventy-seven cloth bales arrived at the dock. There is no news of Tongzhou cotton arriving. It is reported that 12,800 bales of Yao cotton arrived and were sold out, which shows how hot the sales are. Yesterday, 530 pieces came from North Sha and 370 pieces from Baimao. Today, 545 pieces are exported to Shantou and 260 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of spot cotton traded and the market price are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Market prices for foreign cotton fabrics: The New York market is constantly in a state of panic. When President Roosevelt's brother's decisive message was released, people were very excited. Unexpectedly, after the budget plan was released, enthusiasm suddenly decreased. The government's budget for this year's expenses is much larger than in previous years, and the government's finances are not as able to balance income and expenditure as generally expected. That is, under the cotton loan items for several years, the national treasury has loaned as much as 650 million gold yuan. It is reported that the government intends to increase some taxes. Recently, someone in Washington suggested that the government adopt a five-year cotton industry plan to gradually sell the 12 million bales of cotton stored under the loan within this period, thereby restoring the government's financial normalcy. At the same time, it ordered the reduction of 7 million acres of cotton fields, strictly ordering that the total amount of cotton fields should not exceed 27 million acres, so that cotton production would decrease, and loan cotton could be sold at a good price. At the same time, it would not cause cotton prices to fall too sharply due to the large-scale sale of government loans. This method is very good, and the government may adopt it and provide it for discussion in Congress. However, most of the views are that it is difficult for other cotton prices to improve if government loan cotton is sold on the market, so many people are taking profits, and the New Orleans market is also selling out in New York. The market price is therefore not prosperous. Yesterday, the father fell more than ten pounds, and the Indian market fell by more than one rupee. Egypt rose by three or five pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate was not very different, and the legal tender, US cotton, Brazilian cotton, and Indian cotton each fell by three corners per picul, and Egyptian cotton rose by four corners per picul.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transaction in this city is very active. Since China Yong purchased foreign cotton, foreign merchants are also very panicked. Foreign merchants have been meeting for days to discuss countermeasures. The 500 bales of Brazilian cotton purchased by Shen Hsin the day before yesterday, the factory did not pay a penny of fixed silver, but the foreign merchant falsely claimed that the compradors paid the money. In fact, the foreign merchants themselves are also rubbing each other from time to time. If each Chinese factory refuses to purchase for two weeks, the foreign cotton firms will abandon the saying that Chinese factories need to prepay fixed silver. Japanese factories are still the main buyers of foreign cotton, and they must purchase two or three thousand bales every day. The prices are still firm inside and outside of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Cotton Yarn Inspection is Quite Strict <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>In eastern Zhejiang, the authorities are more stringent in inspecting import and export goods. According to Ningbo sources, the 20-count Red Kuixing yarn produced by the Chung Tah Sheng yarn factory in the Nantong occupied area is not allowed to be imported. However, if it is produced by a certain factory in Shanghai in cooperation with Japanese merchants, it was not allowed to be imported at first, but now it is allowed to pass. I don't know why.</p>
<p>Cotton transactions may have a very large turn. The amount of transactions and spot market prices are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Daily Situation is Getting Better; Cotton Yarn is Getting Stronger and Stronger; Each Jump is 5, 6, 7, or 8 Yuan Different <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is tightening, and the rising wind is getting stronger and stronger, and the atmosphere is very exciting. The atmosphere is due to the prosperity of customer sales, and the purchasing power in the south is particularly strong, and it is continuous throughout the day. Because the domestic demand in eastern Zhejiang is becoming smoother every day, the goods on the market are gradually sold out. In this active actual sales, the factory took the opportunity to sell a lot, so that the factory inventory is dry. The idea of absorption by the same industry and hoarders is even stronger. In this environment, the yarn market will of course get better and better every day. However, some old bulls who have suffered extremely high risks in the past are gradually unloading. The situation in the market yesterday morning was that a certain bank raised the price of 20-count Shuangma and collected 100-200 bales in the afternoon. With this news spreading, people were shocked and unanimously bullish. In addition, customer sales did not stop, and buying was still frequent, and the opening price jumped by three or four yuan. Then, as buyers became more crowded, the factory was unwilling to sell, and the market situation became tighter and tighter, jumping another two or three yuan. It was found that the statistics of transactions in the morning totaled 2,050 bales, and the transactions in the afternoon totaled 280 bales, totaling 2,330 bales. As a result, the price of 20-count Te Jin Cheng rose by 8 yuan, Shuang Di Qiu rose by 7 yuan, Tian Nu rose by 5 yuan and a half, Shuang Ma rose by 7 yuan, and Mu Yang rose by 5 yuan and a half. The price of 10-count and 16-count group yarn all rose by 3-4 yuan. The factory opened 100 pieces of 20-count Te Jin Cheng from Yong An factory, priced at 380 yuan, and 500 bales of 20-count Shuang Di Qiu from Xin Yu factory, priced at 370-71 yuan, and 150 bales of 10-count Bao Yi from Hong Zhang factory, priced at 282 yuan. Today, 680 pieces of cotton yarn are shipped to Shantou and 93 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Although the sales of Japanese yarn are not smooth, the market price continues to move forward, driven by Chinese yarn</p>
<p>The rally was so strong that it was pulled up by it, but the distant price at the close of the session fell back by a small yuan. The current price of 20-count Shui Yue yarn is 306.5 yuan, and the price for this month is 306-04.5 yuan. The current price of 20-count Lan Feng yarn is 304.5 yuan, and the price for this month is 304-03 yuan.</p>

<p>White melon seeds from Henan are scarce because of transportation difficulties. The goods sold on the market are mostly from Luhe. There is a need for those who come from the mainland in this street. The large slices are dry and the color is good. Good goods are sold to 27-8 yuan, and ordinary ones are 22-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Black melon seeds in the market are still thin, so the trend is upright and beautiful. Companies such as the Guazi Company in this street absorb more, and there are also some going to export. Yesterday, Xing Pan Xu Kui seeds were sold for 34 yuan, Tushan seeds were 32-3 yuan, Dalian seeds were 24-5 yuan, and Jiaozhou seeds were sold for 65-71-2 yuan per yard.

<p>The source of Yantai scallops is rare, so the bottom stock here is thin. However, most of the scallops sold in the market are probably Eastern goods, because their goods are fat, large and tender, while the national product is yellow and small. Recently, it is sold for 235 yuan, but only dots in between. It is said that Eastern goods must be sold for 280 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Star Anise is Profitable, Indirectly Procured from Hong Kong <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Star anise was once lacking in spot goods, and the market situation has repeatedly expanded. The highest price reached 115 yuan. Later, the insiders seemed to feel that there was a profit to be made, so they indirectly procured it from Hong Kong, resulting in more and more arrivals every day. It is reported that the most recent quotation is only 87.5 yuan, which has fallen by more than ten yuan compared with the former, but sales are weak, and it seems to have a tired momentum.</p>

<p>Sichuan Citrus Aurantium, once due to transportation difficulties, the arrival of goods was almost cut off. Between September and October, each load was sold for as much as 3,600 yuan. Later, postal parcels continued to arrive, and the market price gradually returned to low. Until recently, the new goods have been seen on the market, and the source has not been interrupted. The market is currently selling for only 1,600 yuan. It has been found that procurement is still strong in various places, and its momentum is expected to stabilize.</p>

<p>The situation of national cloth continues to be firm and expensive, and most of the selling prices have risen. The rising wind of thin cloth and thin twill is the most violent, but the green Hunan and Jiangxi gangs purchased in large quantities, gathered at the ports of Wen, Ningbo and Taizhou. The Shaoxing gang also purchased strongly, transshipping through Ningbo. The Zhuang customers of the Gan Nan Chang gang also purchased in large quantities, transshipping through Wenzhou. Because the inspection in the mainland is strict, the products of famous manufacturers are searched more urgently. The factory's goods bottom is empty, and the opening price is increasing step by step. Customers also bid to purchase, and thin cloth and thin twill each rose by another 1-2.5 corners per piece. Lun Chang blue cloth, printed cloth and satin rose by 1-2 corners, and color cloth and color twill from various factories also rose by 1 corner. Coarse cloth is still sold at the original price, and the spot sales are constant. The Tianjin gang has purchased more than 100 boxes of Andian blue cloth such as Butterfly brand, which has not been enough. The Ningbo and Shaoxing gangs have purchased 100 pieces of thin cloth, thin twill, coarse cloth, color cloth, and printed satin. Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui customers have absorbed more than 200 pieces of goods for hoarding and spot packaging. The transaction in this street is mainly based on booked blank cloths, and most of the fabrics for January and February produced by each factory, such as taffeta, satin, printed cloth, and twill, have been thrown out. There are few in March, and the forward price has also risen by several corners due to the sharp rise in yarn money and raw materials.</p>
<p>The market situation of Dongbi white goods continues to rise, step by step. Yesterday, the selling price of high-end thin cloth has exceeded 11 yuan, and the quotations for Longtou, Caiqiu and Yanghe are all 11 yuan 5 fen, which is 1 corner and 5 fen higher per piece than the previous day's price.

Because the dyeing blankets in this street are becoming more and more popular, the compensation of various color cloth numbers is more urgent, and the price is gradually raised. The dyeing industry in the entire Japanese street also absorbed about 2,000 pieces of various brands of blankets. Tianjin Yanqing and other gangs each imported 100-200 pieces. It is heard that there are 1,200 pieces in the market that are mutually thrown and made by the market's thoughts and businesses. The prosperity of the market is the first day since the market opened.</p>
<p>The export today is 147 pieces to Shantou, and 5 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Recently, because the weather is very cold, the business of Chinese-style interlayer overcoats is very prosperous, so the general foreign clothing gangs have a special interest in purchasing riding breeches, covert coatings and Choclateens.</p>
<p>Riding breeches</p>
<p>Recently, the black and white colors of No. 30 are still the most expensive, and the English-made 1005 and Kongshi No. 100 are even more popular. The current wholesale price per yard is 13 yuan in national currency. If it is not black and white, it is sold for 9.8 yuan, Kongshi for 12.5 yuan, and black and white for 16 yuan. The supply of Dong goods is still sufficient, so the rise and fall of black and white colors is only a few corners. Yongkang 1005 sells for 7.9 yuan, Yongkang for 6 yuan net, and other low-end yarn fabrics sell for 4 yuan up and down, and the market is very dull. Yihua and Zhanghua sold for 7.25 yuan each.</p>
<p>Covert coating</p>
<p>Also called camel skin brocade, it is popular because the English New Years head number goods are so sleek. Yihua and Shenzhi are second, and Dong goods have not risen much. The popular color is bald and dull. Yesterday, English-made covert coating bald and dull colors had to be sold for 14 yuan, and other colors sold for 13 yuan, which is still very lacking. Yihua goods have risen to 10 yuan (according to the initial sale of only 8.5 yuan), Dong goods Bin number is 8.25 yuan, and No. 2 is 7.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Choclateens</p>
<p>Most of the English-made first-class goods sell for 12.5 yuan, and Dong goods sell for 6.5 yuan and zero cuts for 7.5 yuan. Most of them do not distinguish between expensive and cheap colors, because their market sales are not as popular as covert coatings and riding breeches.</p>

Fellow traders deal in bulk and zero dismantling at 41 yuan per ton, and the price of warehouse receipts is 4-5 jiao to 1 yuan different. The retail price for direct customers is about 14 yuan, which is much better than last month.</p>

<p>###鍛鍊我們的身體</p>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>——有了健全的身體才有偉大的事業——</p>
<p>諸位：都是未來的主人翁，所以你們大家都應該負起建國救國的責任，允其現在正是「抗戰建國的一的時候，對於鍛鍊我們的身體，實在不容一刻緩了：你不看見列强各國軍備競爭的狂熱嗎？但是他們雖然是强盛之邦，科學昌明，財力寬裕，民智發建，還是很努力地鍛鍊國民的身體，以備將來禦侮保國衛民之用。返觀祖國屢遭侵略，至今日又在抗戰奮鬭中的中國人民，却毫不注意自己的身體，我覺得非常遺憾憾，小朋友，速即覺醒呀！</p>
<p>「有了健全的身體，才有偉大的事業。」這確是金科玉律的話，你小看見住在上海收容所裏的許多兒童，因爲給養的不足，就有不少的兒童，爲了生病而致死，恐怕這「死亡率」的數字很可驚吧！倘使這許多死去的兒童，不受到逃難的痛苦，也許不會死掉，說不定他們都有偉大的事業，前程無量。一方面是遭到惡劣環境的原因，一方面也是自己身體太弱的緣故，病菌的侵入，完全基於身體不健全而不能抵抗病菌所致。那沒死去的兒童，便是證明他們的身體，一定是比死去的兒實强健，你們以爲如何？「强國先强種，强種要强身，强身須體育。」體育，中國提倡了好久，但是成績何在？我們記得出席世運時，歸來只有〇分，道是丟臉的事！也可以知道我國的體育太幼稚了！我們太不努力了！果然也是未經合理的倡導，和一般社會人士的忽略，佔着重大的原因。體育的功效；對於個人，可以使虛弱身體，逐漸銀鍊成强健而有爲；對於國家民族，更能建立一偭强盛的國家，健全的民族。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們愛運動嗎？運動是使我們的肌肉，堅實而發達，由發達而充實，由充實而健全。尤其我們小朋友，正當身體發育的黃金時代，應該特別努力！否則，如果不能獲到圓滿的發育，那末，國家民族的前途，是非常憂慮的。你們一面必須讀書，一面也要努力運動，你們的父母師長一定會前來指導的。不過，我們「讀書的時候用功讀書，運動的時候努力運動。」强國是基於强民，强健的人民，才可以負起建國救國的重大的責任，最後我們要高呼：趕快「鍛鍊我們的身體！」小朋友！醒醒吧！起來努力呀！努力呀！</p>
<h3 id="e179">成績單 <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 淺笑</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們的學校快要放寒假了罷。當老師把本學期的成績單發給你的時候，你作何感想？</p>
<p>如果你的成績惡劣，有幾種功課不及格，你接到了成績單，羞愧得面紅耳赤，同時，對着被老師獎勵的同學，有嫉妬的心理。羞愧是應該的，你要羞愧，並且自責過去的不肯努力；但是別去嫉妬用功的同學，你自己喪失獎勵的機會啊。</p>
<p>如果你的成績優良，心裏很覺愉快，對於被老師譴責的同學，輕視或是譏笑。愉快是應該的，努力半載，有這樣的收穫，自然「心花怒放」。可是不要輕視或譏笑那些怠惰的同學，應該勉勵他們。</p>
<p>我知道小朋友們的脾氣，拿到了滿意的成績單，回到家中，往往不等家長詢問，就笑嘻嘻地把成績單給家長看。成績不好的小朋友，把一張成績單塞在書包裹，「沒精打采」地回家，不作一聲，當作沒有這件事一樣，直等家長討着看，方纔從書包裹慢慢地找出來，側着臉丟在家長的手裏。</p>
<p>「往者不追，來者猶可及」。「失敗是成功之母。無論那一位小朋友，要有在下學期裏格外努力的决心。現在成續好的，切勿自滿；成績壞的，快向家長老實承認過去的錯誤，更勉勵自己，求學業的進步。</p>
<h3 id="e180">Temper Our Bodies <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>——Only with a sound body can we have a great career——</p>
<p>Everyone: You are all masters of the future, so you should all take on the responsibility of building and saving the nation. Since now is the time for "resistance and nation-building," tempering our bodies cannot be delayed for even a moment. Don't you see the craze for military competition among the powers? But even though they are strong nations, with advanced science, ample financial resources, and well-developed public intelligence, they still work hard to temper the bodies of their citizens in preparation for defending the country and protecting the people in the future. Looking back at our motherland, which has been repeatedly invaded, and the Chinese people who are now fighting in the war of resistance, yet pay no attention to their bodies, I feel very regretful. Children, wake up quickly!</p>
<p>"Only with a sound body can we have a great career." This is indeed a golden rule. Don't you see the many children living in the Shanghai shelters, who, due to insufficient supplies, have many children die from illness? I'm afraid the numbers for this "mortality rate" are alarming! If these many dead children had not suffered the pain of fleeing, perhaps they would not have died. Perhaps they all had great careers and unlimited futures. On the one hand, it is caused by the bad environment, and on the other hand, it is because their bodies are too weak. The invasion of germs is entirely due to unhealthy bodies that cannot resist germs. The children who did not die are proof that their bodies must be stronger than the children who died. What do you think? "A strong nation must first have a strong race, a strong race must have a strong body, and a strong body must have physical education." Physical education has been promoted in China for a long time, but what are the results? We remember that when we attended the World Games, we only came back with 0 points, which is an embarrassing thing! It can also be seen that our country's physical education is too immature! We haven't worked hard enough! It is also true that the lack of reasonable advocacy and the neglect of the general public are major reasons. The effect of physical education; for individuals, it can gradually train a weak body into a strong and promising one; for the nation, it can build a strong country and a healthy nation.</p>
<p>Children! Do you love sports? Exercise makes our muscles firm and developed, from development to enrichment, and from enrichment to health. Especially for us children, who are in the golden age of physical development, we should work especially hard! Otherwise, if we cannot achieve full development, then the future of the country and the nation is very worrying. You must study on the one hand, and also work hard to exercise on the other hand. Your parents and teachers will definitely come to guide you. However, we "study hard when we study, and work hard when we exercise." A strong country is based on a strong people, and only a strong people can take on the important responsibility of building and saving the nation. Finally, we must shout: Hurry up and "temper our bodies!" Children! Wake up! Get up and work hard! Work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Report Card <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xiao</p>
<p>Children! Your schools will soon be on winter vacation. When the teacher gives you your report card for this semester, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>If your grades are bad, and you fail in several subjects, when you receive your report card, you blush with shame. At the same time, you have feelings of jealousy towards classmates who are rewarded by the teacher. Shame is appropriate. You should be ashamed and blame yourself for not working hard in the past; but don't be jealous of hard-working classmates, you yourself lost the opportunity for reward.</p>
<p>If your grades are excellent, you feel very happy. You despise or ridicule classmates who are condemned by the teacher. Happiness is appropriate. After working hard for half a year, having such a harvest, you will naturally "bloom with joy." But don't despise or ridicule those lazy classmates, you should encourage them.</p>
<p>I know the temperaments of children. When they get a satisfactory report card, they often don't wait for their parents to ask, and they smilingly show the report card to their parents when they get home. Children with bad grades stuff a report card into their schoolbag and go home "listlessly," without saying a word, as if nothing happened, waiting for their parents to ask to see it before slowly taking it out of their schoolbag and throwing it into their parents' hands with their faces turned away.</p>
<p>"The past cannot be追, but the future can be caught up." "Failure is the mother of success." No matter which child you are, you must have the determination to work harder in the next semester. Those who are doing well now should not be complacent; those with bad grades should quickly confess their past mistakes to their parents and encourage themselves to seek academic progress.</p>

<p>Ahua and Lehua's home is so beautifully decorated today! At the gate, four large flower balls swing back and forth! The national flags are also solemnly displayed. The two lanterns bought during last year's Double Tenth Festival are also hung up today! Ahua is, after all, a bit older. The five large characters "New Year Celebration Party" above the gate are written with such vigor!</p>
<p>The ones greeting guests at the gate today aren't the two young hosts. It turns out that beside the red paper ball is also a lively parrot! It's especially happy today, and the newly learned phrase "Guests, please come in!" is even more melodious than usual.</p>
<p>A group of children, five girls and two boys, are all wearing new red and green clothes, holding hands, jumping and skipping, with wide smiles, as they arrive at Ailuo's house. Pin Fang, as a neighbor, leads the six children inside. The parrot above chirps seven times, indicating that every guest should be treated equally, without favoritism.</p>
<p>After a while, a total of nine people, including Ahua and Lehua, are seated around a round table covered with a white tablecloth. Ahua, as the host, is elected as the chairperson and stands up. She first asks everyone to put the candies they brought in front of them. The colorful candies adorning the snow-white tablecloth make it even more beautiful and pleasing to the eye. As they are eating happily and talking enthusiastically, one child notices a beggar child standing at the entrance of their venue. He exclaims in surprise, and all the children in the venue turn their curious gaze towards the pitiful child. However, Ahua and Pin Fang are stunned, as they believe that in today's environment, he is the most pitiful person! So Pin Fang eagerly suggests, "Everyone, look! This child is so pitiful! I propose that we invite him to join our celebration party!" The proposal is immediately approved by everyone, and they elect the chairperson to invite him in. At this moment, a knowing smile appears on the face of the pitiful child.</p>
<p>Pin Fang, who is the most resourceful, suggests inviting Ahua's mother to give a speech. After going to invite her, Ahua's mother comes downstairs without hesitation. As soon as she enters the venue, she sees a child in ragged clothes among the children. She is not surprised; she understands that this must be a manifestation of their pure compassion! Then she says the following:</p>
<p>"Children of the world, no one is greater than you! Without adult guidance, you were able to do something so valuable! Today, I wholeheartedly approve of what you are doing! However, I have another idea to contribute to you: from today onwards, please resolve to be thrifty and save money to help children as pitiful as this one. This way, your celebration party today will be the most valuable!"</p>
<p>"Clap, clap, clap..." The applause lasts for more than a minute. Finally, they all raise their glasses and drink a large glass of plain water!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Smallpox and Vaccination <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Huanghui</p>
<p>Children, if you just pay a little attention on the streets, you will surely see posters in red and green colors advocating for cowpox vaccination pasted on the utility poles at various important locations. At the same time, according to recent newspaper reports, smallpox is prevalent in the isolated island, and the mortality rate is quite high. The authorities are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>Smallpox is a violent infectious disease. Once a person contracts smallpox, even if they are fortunate enough to survive, they will inevitably have a face full of pockmarks. A pockmarked face is so unsightly. In fact, although smallpox gives people such violent attacks, people also give it a fatal blow in advance, so that it does not have any vitality to erupt. To do this, there is absolutely no other way but to administer cowpox vaccination.</p>
<p>Cowpox was invented by the Englishman Jenner. The pustular fluid from cows is taken to make a vaccine, and then transplanted into people, which can prevent smallpox. Every time people get vaccinated with cowpox, if the result is good, they can be protected from smallpox for five to seven years. However, young children should be vaccinated once a year, and after they get older, about three more vaccinations will guarantee lifelong immunity to smallpox. The benefits of cowpox vaccination are obvious without saying more here.</p>
<p>However, after being vaccinated with cowpox, five things must be paid attention to: (1) Do not scratch with your hands when it itches, (2) Do not damage the pustules, (3) Pay attention to the cleanliness of clothes, (4) Do not do strenuous exercise, (5) Do not take a bath within a month after vaccination.</p>
<p>Children! The danger of smallpox and the benefits of vaccination, I think everyone already knows. To prevent pockmarks and death, hurry up and get vaccinated with cowpox!</p>

<h3 id="e184">One Year Older Again <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Honghui, Fifth Grade Student of Fuchun Elementary School</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, it is the New Year of the 28th year again, and I am one year older. Some people in the world, from childhood to adulthood, have done great things and made a career, seeking benefits for the public and benefiting the masses. Some are silent and unknown, some betray the country for personal gain, and some become thieves. This is all due to the lack of universal education.</p>
<p>But what methods should be used to correct these adverse effects! We should first think about children. Therefore, we educated children should have some knowledge. When the New Year comes, we should not blindly engage in meaningless games. Moreover, now is a time of crisis. Think about the children in the war zone, who are not warmly clothed, not fed enough, and their lives are so pitiful. We children living in the concessions should think about them and what methods to use to save them? I think during this New Year, we should save the money given to us by our parents and relatives and donate it, accumulating small amounts into large amounts, and help the children in need. At the same time, we can also take advantage of this holiday to review our lessons and work hard. When we are young, we should be able to endure hardship and cultivate good habits, so that we can serve society in the future. Only then can we children live up to being one year older.</p>

<p>— Cao Xing, Fifth Grade Student of Bugao Elementary School</p>
<p>Dear children, aren't you all welcome to receive New Year cards? But I also have many classmates who sent me New Year cards, mostly to congratulate me on my happiness. But I strongly disagree with this, so I returned the New Year cards they sent me unopened. I also wrote a letter to them with the following content: Dear classmate: I have returned the New Year card you sent me. There are two reasons why I returned it to you: First, we are currently in a time of national crisis, and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles. Why don't we save the money for buying New Year cards and buy cotton clothes to donate to the soldiers on the front lines, to increase their fighting spirit. Second, now is the time of frugality. Save the money for New Year cards and use it to save our compatriots in distress. This is the biggest reason why I refuse to accept New Year cards.</p>

<p>— Li Feiying, Ningbo Shanghai Third Elementary School</p>
<p>The crow is flying in the sky. He feels that he has reached the realm of unbearable. He is surrounded by deep darkness like a curtain, so that he can't see a ray of sunlight, but his hot blood is surging in every blood vessel. He demands to break through the curtain surrounding him.</p>
<p>Because he feels that time is not waiting for us. We must be kind to time. We must take advantage of our youth to rush forward, decide a victory or defeat, and find a bright path. But when he thought of this, he clamored. He made up his mind, and beat his wings a few times. He stretched his neck</p>
<p>long. He shouted in a very clear voice, while the hot blood has not dried up, drum up the courage, shout a struggle, and move forward.</p>
<p>However, he exhausted the strength of his wings. He does not feel tired, he does not feel difficult, everyone hurry up and rush out of the dark curtain. He shouted again, ah, now is our time! Now is our time!</p>

<p>— Xu Lianlian, Sixth Grade Student of Minzhi Elementary School</p>
<p>Dear children, I'm here to introduce a small toy to you. The toy is very simple: Just have your younger brother and sister sit on all four sides of a square table in the evening, put a small metal pot in the middle of the table, put half a spoonful of salt in the pot, then pour half a spoonful of alcohol into it, and then turn off the lights, and use a match to light the alcohol in the small pot. The firelight emitted will allow you to see each other's faces turn scary and strange. After the alcohol is burned out, turn on the lights, and your faces will return to normal again. What is the reason for this? That is completely a chemical reaction. When you go to middle school to study chemistry, you will know the principle of this flame.</p>

<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>Son: The New Year is coming! Can Dad buy me a rabbit lantern to play with?</p>
<p>Father: Good boy, during this time of national crisis, we should think about thrift when buying anything. This kind of unnecessary toy can certainly be saved. It's better for me to tell you some common knowledge about rabbits.</p>
<p>Son: Okay! Okay! Please tell me!</p>
<p>Father: You must have seen rabbits. They are a type of small rodent. Based on the different environments in which they live, they can be divided into wild rabbits and domestic rabbits.</p>
<p>Son: Oh! I used to see many snow-white rabbits in the zoo. They were very cute. Aren't those wild rabbits?</p>
<p>Father: Now I will start talking about the types of rabbits. Listen quietly:</p>
<p>Wild rabbits (see Figure 1) are a type of rabbit that lives in forests and fields. Their body color is brownish-tea and mixed with gray. Their body length is about two feet and their ears are three inches long. Their forelimbs are quite short, and their hind limbs are half a foot long, so they are extremely fast when climbing hills, but because the forelimbs are short and the hind limbs are long, and the limbs are not balanced, they are not very fast when going downhill! They hide in caves or grass during the day and come out at night to forage for tree bark, leaves, buds, and vegetables. Sometimes they harm crops. Their meat is for food, but it is not very fresh. Their fur and skin are also widely used.</p>
<p>Son: Are domestic rabbits similar in shape to wild rabbits?</p>
<p>Father: Domestic rabbits were originally domesticated from wild rabbits. Their heads and ears are shorter than those of wild rabbits, and their hind limbs are not as long as those of wild rabbits. The most common is the ordinary domestic rabbit (see Figure 2). This rabbit is found everywhere. Its appearance varies slightly depending on the place of origin. It is said that this rabbit originated in Africa along the Mediterranean Sea. Its ears are long and its eyes are scarlet red! The body color is gray, yellow, black, white, and brown. Its meat can be eaten, and its fur and skin can be used as various materials. People raise it not only for food and entertainment, but also for cultivating pathogenic bacteria for medical purposes. In addition, there is the Angora rabbit (see Figure 3), which is the most famous wool rabbit. This rabbit originated in Angora, Turkey. Its body color is brown, white, blue, black, and several other colors. Its fur is four or five inches long, soft and silky, and its appearance is extremely gorgeous. For meat rabbits, the Flemish Giant breed is the most famous, weighing from thirteen pounds to twenty pounds! The next are the Normandy, Dutch, Japanese, and Belgian breeds. The Belgian breed (see Figure 4) is commonly raised. Its shape is very similar to a brown wild rabbit. It weighs about eight pounds. Its bones are thin, and its meat is abundant and tastes quite good. It can be regarded as the top of meat rabbits. This rabbit originated in Belgium. It has a strong physique and can adapt to various climates. In England, there is a long-eared rabbit (see Figure 5). Its ears are very large and the ear width is quite wide, starting from behind the eyes and hanging down: the front part of the body is slightly lower, and the rear part is high and protruding. When stationary, the head is lowered, and the ears hang to the ground. The posture is very beautiful. Its body color is yellow, gray, brown, and other colors. The price is very expensive. This type of rabbit is a well-known type of pet rabbit. As for the rabbit breeds used for fur, the more famous ones are: Rex, Havana, Sable, Blue, Silver Gray, Silver Fox, and Pearl. The above several types are the general types of domestic rabbits.</p>
<p>Son: Why are rabbit's tails all very short?</p>
<p>Father: This is for the convenience of its climbing, running, and jumping. If the tail is too long, it will not be suitable for its short forelimbs and long hind limbs, so its tail has degenerated into a very short section. In eastern and southern Europe and western Siberia in Asia, there is a tailless rabbit (see Figure 6). Its forelimbs are almost as long as its hind limbs, its head is round, its ears are very short, and its tail is extremely short and not exposed outside the body, so it is called the tailless rabbit.</p>
<p>Son: Dad! You said earlier that rabbits are small rodents. What does it mean to be a rodent?</p>
<p>Father: Oh! It turns out that the rabbit has four incisors in the upper jaw, the two in the center are larger, and the lower jaw only has two large incisors. When it chews food, the upper jaw moves up and down, which is suitable for cutting, and the lower jaw moves horizontally, which is suitable for chewing. Its upper lip is very thick, with a longitudinal cleft in the middle that reaches the nose. This cleft has the function of grasping, which can draw food and send it into the mouth: it also exposes the incisors, making it easy to grind things. This is a unique feature of rodents.</p>
<p>Son: Besides being used for our entertainment and food, do rabbits have other uses?</p>
<p>Father: Rabbit fur can be spun into velvet yarn, and can also be woven into woolen fabrics and made into felt hats. Rabbit skin can be used to make gloves, earmuffs, shoes, as well as coats and shawls. Its uses are very wide. Therefore, there are as many as fourteen million three hundred thousand domestic rabbits raised in various countries!</p>
<p>Son: Dad, when will you buy a few rabbits for me to raise?</p>
<p>Father: Okay, when you grow up a little more, I will definitely buy them for you!</p>

<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>——Ming Er's Escape Record, Part 9——</p>
<p>As the east just began to reveal a fish-belly white color, the three small boats started their "kluk-kluk" sound, slowly moving along the center of the river like snakes. Far away on both banks, Ming Er stretched his neck, barely able to see a row of short mulberry trees and patches of vegetable gardens; the old leaves of the mulberry trees were showing a color of imminent withering, a sign of late autumn, but the vegetable leaves were all adorably green.</p>
<p>The boat was already moving so slowly, but Heaven was unwilling to help; gusts of headwind hit Ming Er's face. So the boatman ordered his assistant to carry the tow rope ashore. The assistant was not very tall, but his legs were thick and strong, and his chest was quite broad, showing a strong appearance. He jumped into the river, which was not very deep, the water only reaching his calves. He quickly ran forward, releasing the rope, like a kite-flying action in spring. When the rope was fully released, he carried the rope and walked forward step by step with even strides. So the small boat was a little faster than before, but the speed was very limited.</p>
<p>"Brother, how many days will we be in Jiangxi? Can we get there by tomorrow?" Ming Er felt that the boat was moving so slowly that he thought that even tomorrow would be too late to arrive in Jiangxi. His brother, Congming, heard this.</p>
<p>"You make it sound so easy. Jiangxi Province is thousands of miles away from here, I'm afraid even taking a train would be too late." His brother answered him this way. "Jiangxi Province is quite big, so what is our destination in Jiangxi? Our lives will probably change too." "Jingdezhen." "Jingdezhen, that name sounds very familiar, I remember, it's a very famous place for producing porcelain. So how do we get there?" "Didn't you hear? We plan to go to Hangzhou first, because we can take a boat or a train to get there. But I heard that taking a boat from Hangzhou is more economical, while the train is bound to be very crowded. There are so many of us, we can't squeeze on. From Hangzhou, we take a boat to Tunxi in Anhui, and then from Tunxi we take a bus to Jingdezhen, and then we take a small boat to reach our destination. Can you imagine how much trouble this is? It is said that it will take about half a month to get there." Cong Er spoke at length, finally making Ming Er understand the itinerary of this escape.</p>
<p>Their mother was worried about our breakfast, because when we got on the boat, it was already midnight, so we didn't buy any food. So the old lady opened her mouth to the boatman and said, "Boatman, at which small town can we go ashore to buy some vegetables?"</p>
<p>The boatman said very politely, "Madam. A little further ahead, there are things to buy in that town."</p>
<p>By this time, the sun had already risen from the east, and Ming Er's stomach was rumbling with hunger, but how could he dare to utter a word about being hungry, because no one had anything to eat! With great difficulty, they arrived at the small town. The mother asked the boatman to buy rice and vegetables. The boatman left for a while and had not yet returned, which made it difficult for Ming Er to bear. But he had no choice but to be hungry. He just stared, stared, and stared, when the boatman came back, he was overjoyed, but he still had to wash the rice and cook the vegetables. While the porridge was cooking, a burst of porridge aroma filled the cabin, making the hungry worms in his stomach seem to jump out. After waiting for a long time, the porridge was cooked, which made him even happier to jump up. He ate three bowls in a hurry, and wanted to eat two more bowls, but in fact he was not allowed, so he had to endure it.</p>
<p>Ming Er's younger siblings were dizzy because the small boat was swaying in the river, and also because they didn't go out often. One by one, they lay on the bed that couldn't be called a bed, which made the mother feel uneasy, and she kept asking them: "Are you feeling better now?" But they were still lying silently. This also made Ming Er unhappy, because getting sick while escaping is the most unfortunate thing.</p>
<p>When Ming Er first got on the boat, he looked east and west, and didn't feel lonely. Later, he became a little disgusted, and sat blankly in the cabin, only seeing the sun gradually moving from east to west, and soon it was time for lunch, and soon it was time for dinner, and it passed quickly, but one night made him miserably curl up in a long and cold night.</p>

<p>In the "How to Calculate the Day of the Week for the 28th Year" section of the Children's Weekly New Year's issue, the number for May should not be 3, but 2. I am afraid that other children will be mistaken because of this, so I hereby make a correction.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Historical Materials for Children: Children's Military Camp for Elementary School Students in Chongqing <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>Children, let me report a valuable piece of news to you. This is a historical material for children during the sacred War of Resistance. Recently, the elementary school students in Chongqing, the national military center, organized a children's military camp, adhering to the teaching of "reading without forgetting saving the country." All elementary school students aged nine to fifteen have the right to freely participate in this "children's military camp." Their lives are completely in line with military education. Every child soldier has taken on a major task.</p>
<p>Their organization is roughly divided into four major tasks: comforting, transportation, propaganda, and maintaining traffic and air defense. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Comfort: The children's military camp sends a number of child soldiers to rear hospitals and wounded soldier hospitals every day to perform comforting work. They write letters home for the soldiers, read important news from the day's newspapers, and do other trivial tasks to help the nurses.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation: The child soldiers have the obligation to transport all comfort items sent by the people in the rear to the soldiers. They must also help with other relatively easy military transportation tasks when there are not enough transportation soldiers.</p>
<p>(3) Propaganda: The children's military camp sends soldiers to nearby towns and villages on a daily basis to give brief speeches, so that the general public with less knowledge can understand the significance of this great War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(Traffic and Air Defense): This is the most important task, which is to help the police and military police maintain traffic and air defense. When the enemy planes attack the first warning. The child soldiers must immediately prohibit pedestrians and vehicles from passing, and send pedestrians, passengers and drivers to nearby houses or air-raid shelters in a very disciplined manner. When the second warning sounds, the people on the street should disappear completely, otherwise they will be found by the officers of the Children's Military Camp and will be subject to considerable punishment.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the tasks of the child soldiers are so complicated and important. Their lives are even more serious and disciplined. They are also very kind and amiable to the people. The clothes they wear are almost exactly the same as ordinary soldiers, and they also wear symbols on their chests. The only thing missing is firearms.</p>
<p>Children, the elementary school students in Chongqing have taken on the work that adults do during the War of Resistance. And we elementary school students on the isolated island are still living very safely. This makes us feel ashamed to some extent! I hope that the children can quickly implement the "saving and storing money" and contribute to the country. And undertake a part of the anti-Japanese and national salvation work for elementary school students! (Translated from the English version of the Great American News)</p>
<h3 id="e193">Snow White (Part Two) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Celestial Grandson</p>
<p>This dream can be done anytime, anywhere; even when washing dishes or scrubbing floors, one can enjoy dreaming, and no one can interfere. So, although Snow White toiled away day after day, working very hard, her appearance became more and more beautiful, which was due to her optimistic nature nurtured by her dreams. Every time she looked at her tattered clothes, she would dream that they were cloud brocade garments woven from butterfly wings, and that she was embracing and dancing with a handsome young prince, as inseparable as lacquer and glue. She also dreamed of that perfect day of marriage, when she and the prince would marry and go hand in hand to the palace in the clouds, to live a sweet and happy life.</p>
<p>In the garden of the palace, there was a well, called the Wishing Well, said to grant your wishes if you spoke your desires aloud into it. It was very effective. So Snow White went to the well every day, lay on the edge, and spoke of her desires from the bottom of her heart, wishing for a handsome young prince to come and rescue her from this pit of suffering, and to become a happy couple with her.</p>
<p>One day, a handsome young prince, wandering from a faraway kingdom, passed by the palace garden and happened to hear Snow White's silver-bell-like sweet voice, as she was speaking her wishes into the well.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, the prince's heart stirred, and he suddenly appeared in the palace garden, attracting Snow White's attention. At first sight, they fell in love and began to cherish each other. Unfortunately, the hateful Queen saw them from the window, watching the prince and Snow White together, talking and laughing so happily, and hearing the prince call out to the princess: "The most beautiful woman in the world."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the Queen's face immediately turned pale. Filled with anger and jealousy, she gathered her long train in her arms, hurried down the seven corridors, passed through the seven doors, and went straight to her secret chamber, where she angrily questioned the magic mirror: "Mirror on the wall, please answer me, who is the most beautiful woman in the world?"</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, a layer of emerald green mist covered the magic mirror. Suddenly, a strange mouth opened on the mirror surface, uttering words that the Queen feared to hear most. She heard it say: "My Queen, today I have seen a young lady of peerless beauty, who is now much more beautiful than you. Her lips are as red as roses, her skin as white as snow, her hair as black as ebony, beautiful! Extremely beautiful."</p>
<p>Yes, it was true, Snow White was the most beautiful woman in the world!</p>
<p>The Queen's jealousy burned, how could she tolerate a mere girl surpassing her in beauty? So, in her venomous heart, a venomous plan arose. She immediately issued an order in a rage, summoning her huntsman to the palace. The huntsman dared not neglect, hurriedly rushed into the palace, knelt at the foot of the throne, and asked anxiously: "Your Majesty, what command do you have for your humble servant?" The Queen uttered a cold voice, saying: "I order you to take Snow White into the forest tomorrow. You must return alone. Do you understand? You must return alone. And you must do it well, without error, and when you return, you must bring her heart in a box to show me." As she spoke, she took out a jewel-encrusted box and handed it to the huntsman.</p>
<p>Having received the order, the huntsman felt as if a stone was pressing on his heart, unable to let it go. He thought, Snow White is gentle, lovely, and beautiful, and has committed no crime, yet the Queen cannot tolerate her and issues this vicious order, insisting that he take her life, how could one even begin to speak of such a thing!</p>
