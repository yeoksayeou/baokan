<h3 id="c9">英蘇談判與侵略的進攻 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>這幾天來，英蘇談判仍在若即若離狀態中，雖英法另擬草案，但事實上並沒有多大的進展。法國一再表示從中「斡旋」，英國政府雖已派了中歐司長到莫斯科去接洽，但成效還在未定之天。張伯倫堅持不肯在實際問題上讓步，不肯予波羅的海諸國的安全以正面的保障，這就證明了英蘇作風的不同。這在張伯倫的主觀上，也許只是想把英蘇談判作爲對德示威的武器。他的目的，只是想在新方向上促成舊政策。昨天本報的倫敦通信，曾經說：「照張伯倫的打算，蘇聯即使接受了英法的提議，接着立刻開始的將不是具體地去制裁侵略，而反是和德義開始「調整邦交」。這「調整」萬一順利，就會隨時隨地又轉了方向，走向四强公約之途，重行踏上張伯倫的老路綫的」。這不是沒有可能性的歸宿。我們從最近英國外交表示中，也可以看出這種趨向來：哈里法克斯八日的演說，力說「侵略時代已成過去，」張伯倫九日演說，又表示願循談判途徑，討論德國的要求；這一切，不正是張伯倫幻想的明白反映嗎？</p>
<p>正因爲張伯倫還沒有根絕「綏靖政策」的幻想，所以集體安全制還不能順利地建立，侵略的危機還不能有效地制止。是的，在德義積極邁進之下，英國確曾建立了部份的保障制度，給予了波蘭羅馬尼亞土耳其希臘等國以保障。但這保障只限於上述諸國，却並不及於其他有遭侵略危險的國家。這種保障的有限制，等於是加强拒絕保障其他方向的安全。英國名政論家杜德說得好：「張伯倫塡補了某幾個老鼠洞，而不肯塡補另幾個，目的只是讓老鼠好向沒有塡補的洞去奔竄」。他保障了土耳其，希臘，羅馬尼亞和波蘭，却拒絕明白地保障波羅的海沿岸的三小國；這用惡的解釋，等於阻止希特勒向東南歐進攻，而驅使他向東北歐奔竄。</p>
<p>在英蘇談判遲遲沒有進展的時期，侵略陣綫却就趁機大施反攻。這幾天來，無論在歐洲或是遠東，我們到處可以看到他們的跋扈活躍。在歐洲，德波關係這幾天又頓然緊張起來，但澤旦夕可以發生問題，希特勒目前雖似不致對波用兵，但他却正企圖以「東進」姿態的誘惑，促使張伯倫再演一幕「慕尼黑」；其决，納粹在南北歐和波羅的海的活動，也是異常的積極，而這些都正是英法所沒有加以軍事保障的「老鼠洞」。德義對南斯拉夫的威嚇，南國攝政的訪問柏林，表示了南國正節節被拖入德義的懷抱；丹麥拉脫維亞愛沙尼亞三國已先後與德國締結了互不侵犯條的，這至少表示了對於英法蘇聯談判的不信任。總而言之，在今天，德義侵略者正看淸了英法的弱點，儘量利用英蘇談判停滯的時機，加緊向南北擴展，增强其政治軍事的地位，以準備未來對英法大規模的進攻。</p>
<p>歐洲如此，遠東也完全一樣。日本儘管口口聲聲的說着拒絕加入德義同盟，但實際上它的外交行動郤處處響應着德義。在今天，日本正抓住英國爲對象，到處進行着猛烈的反英運動。鼓浪嶼問題，始終僵持着；上海浦東綸昌紗廠被迫不能開工，英籍職員丁格勒又被無辜刺死；英國武官在張家口，竟給扣留起來；籍口引渡「抗日份子」，日本索性要封鎖天津英租界了。遠東方面這一切的對英手術，多可以看做張伯倫政策所誘致的。</p>
<p>在英蘇談判停滯，普遍的集體安全制沒有建立起來的今天，侵略者當然反攻了。這可見得英法如果對侵略者不根絕妥協的幻想，蘇聯如果沒有發揮實力以反侵略的決心，英法蘇聯三國如果對集體安全不作更徹底的努力，結果是只有帮助了侵略者。我們以爲歐洲和遠東現實的痛苦敎訓，是侵略者各個擊破的初步，我們不以爲這還不夠做英法蘇聯的當頭棒喝！</p>

<p>市商會接醬園業公會函、以市面銅質輔幣日少、吾業油號醬油、人民日需、苦力居多、三五七零星、必爲找出、應付爲難、茲據報載、政府銀行角票、暫可分爲兩、作五分之用、再據政府最近印有分票、救濟市面之公令云、是吾有案、務請明示、以便轉函同業等情、當由商會函復云、查第一說並無根據、第二說亦尚未奉財政部電示、現此事本會正在電請財政部迅籌辦法補救、</p>
<p>避免零找　影響生計</p>
<p>滬市銅元錄幣、已呈空前缺乏現象、各業感受莫大影響、茲爲避免零找計、巳將各物售價予以調整、雖有將物價零數取消者、如一角一二分、改爲一角等、但大多數則乘機將零數加成整數、如一角五六分則加成二角、實行其變相加價、此種趁火打刦之市儈手段、殊屬可恥、無形中平民又增加負擔、故銅兀缺乏、影響平民生計、至深且鉅、</p>
<p>發行分券　盼望甚殷</p>
<p>自上海鍋元缺乏后、即盛傳政府當局將發行一分二分五分三種輔幣券、代替銅輔幣流通市面、各界對於該券之發行、均表同情、蓋香港方面如繼續將大量銅鎳輔幣運滬、途中或未必被刧、但運滬後、亦將被吸收而盡、如發行分券、則可杜絕銅幣繼縱被收之弊、而各業亦可憑此流通、故發行分券、有利無害、且近來市上鎳幣亦漸缺乏、亦係爲奸商所收買轉售、</p>
<p>購買貼標　殊爲擁擠</p>
<p>各業爲便利零找起見、會將郵票代替銅輔幣、此種現象、業已普遍於全市、因之郵票需要激增、在平時各烟兌店、本有郵票代售處、但其售價竟任意提高、如五分郵票竟需銅元十七枚、故目下各商店及私人、均直接向郵局購買、連日來各郵政局郵票　莫不頭擁擠、競相購買，</p>
<p>銅幣缺乏　最大原因</p>
<p>滬市銅元缺管之原因雖甚複雜、惟奸商爲虎作倀、搜羅圖利、致銅鎳新幣來源中斷、實爲最大原因、（一）某方提高價格利誘奸商收買、如銅元老一輩枚、約有市秤二斤半、可售法幣一元、奸商以對本對利、及競相搜集、輔售某方、（二）滬市銅鎳新幣、改由香港運滬供給后、故運輸工作、大都讬由外輪代運、但邇來某方迭次檢查外輸、會有運滬銅鎳輔券被沒收、來源中斷、</p>
<p>每年走私　五千萬元</p>
<p>中國銅元質地優良、在幣前、各地未實行新輔幣前、各地所流通之銅元及汀鄂等省之大銅元、又名雙銅元、市面流通數額頗鉅、新幣制實行後、一部份雖由中央造幣廠收回改鑄一分銅輔幣、部份則爲某方憑藉種種方法、盡量收集運回、作爲軍火原料、近一二年來、收集之風更熾、私運出口數額、亦更鉅、據估計每年走私之銅元、至少在五千萬元以上、</p>

<p>又悉、七日下午一時、日機五架侵入鎭海、投彈狂炸、經要塞防空部隊英勇射擊、擊落日機一架、墮沉於鎮海口外遊山海中、日飛行員一名、則於張傘降落時跌傷斃命、茲悉是役搜得戰利降落傘一頂、手槍一支、飛行帽一頂、皮靴一雙、已於十一日由防軍解送寗波防守司令部矣、至查擊毀墮海之日機、係八九式雙翼單發動偵察機、爲意國製造、價値三十滁龄餘萬元、至航空員之屍體、已在鎮海義塚埋葬、</p>

<p>字林報云、日文大陸新報昨（十一日）刋社評、題名「反英運動之無可避免性、」略稱、英國如欲保護其在華權益、吾人必須警告其不能以「有裨於中政府」之方法、而應覓他法出之、目前日曬億間之反英氣氛、乃日本國民之憤懣、與反對英國對日政策之表示、英國長此維持其</p>
<p>目前政策</p>
<p>則無抗議反英情緒之權、吾人知日本人民有强烈之反英情緒、旣不欲吾認、亦不擬守秘、然促起此種反英情緒者、非英國本身乎、日本今以其自己之前途、作孤注之一擲、而在華從事生死存亡之搏戰、予反日政府以精神上及物質上的援助者、旣屬英國、則日本對英不能有</p>
<p>友好情緒</p>
<p>勢所必然也、茲坦白表示日本一般人民之感想、即日本不僅與中政府、而與中政府另加英國作戰、英國或抗議日方鼓動、兼庇護華人之反英運動、吾人不知眞有日人參加此種運動吾、然縱有其事、亦不足怪、丁格勒事件、英日總領事互提抗議、事態</p>

<p>食米市價、近因外滙緊縮、百物昂貴、大戶米商看漲、囤戶大量採辦、致最高貨竟漲至十八元、豆米行業公會昨日發表第十一次各棧存米調查總數爲五十六萬七千餘包、較上决减少一萬餘包、惟全市存米、足供市民三個月需要而有餘、屆時新米亦可登塲、故滬市民食、絕無匱乏之虞、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>囤戶採辦　米市尚穩</p>
<p>食米市價、本已轉定、邇來以外、緊縮、各物均告漲價、於是大戶米商、均一律看漲、所擁有三十餘萬包存米、始終不肯出售、同時囤戶乘機在市塲大量採辦、致十一日最高常熟貨每包已回到十八元、昨日復因囤戶進胃活躍、復漲起五分、爲十八元零五分、惟以貨主心思頗堅、成交不到一百包、其他江陰·崑山·蘇州·同里等貨、則自十七元一角至十七元八角、供求相應、故米市情形、尚稱穩定、</p>
<p>疏通來源　到貨仍暢</p>
<p>國米來源、經各米業團體觀告米販向產地大量採辦運滬、疏通來源後、各地到貨頗暢、最近忽傳米船被扣、來源中斷等說、據新新社記者探悉、米船在途中被阻事件、雖屬難免、惟來源並未中斷、現平均每月到貨至少在五千包以上、如昨日河下到船及水陸兩路運到之米、亦達五千餘包、故食米來源、尚稱暢通、</p>
<p>存米可維　持三個月</p>
<p>滬市各堆棧存米數量、昨據豆米行業公會第十一次調查戰告、共爲五十六萬七千五百八十八包、較第十决調查、减少一萬一千三百七十一包、惟第十决調查數、曾較第七次增加一萬六千七百六十七包、故此决减少、絕不足慮、據米業中人語新新社記者、目下各棧存米五十六萬七千五百八十八包、連間全市各米店內棧存貨、的五六萬包在內、足數滬市三個月民食之需、且來貨未斷、而三個月後新米、亦可上市、故滬市民食、絕無匱乏之虞、</p>

<p>今戰事已進入新階段、舉凡軍事政治外交經濟、均從過去血的敎訓中、改進缺點，從新措置、具有充分勝利之把握、惟尚有爲我抗戰勝敗之關鍵、而爲一般民衆所忽視者、即受傷將士、尚未能得到完滿之救護與存卹、期誠抗戰以來最大之遺憾、蓋戰爭之勝利、不僅恃前錢將士之勇敢、及衛生機關設備之完善、必須前後方廣大民衆、能隨時隨地、予以精神物質上慰藉、俾負塲將士、早復康健、重上前綫、始克有濟、昔德之名將魯登道夫、以得到最高數量之歸隊士兵、擭取意料莫及之戰果、對後方人員、三致感謝、足發吾人之深省、我國蝠員廣大、戰區遼闊、益以人力財力物力之缺乏、後方勤務、對於傷病將士之救讓輸送、收容醫療、末能週到計劃、自不得與歐戰時有充分準備之德國相提並論、然「精神終勝物質、團結即是力量、」以五千年歷史悠久之民族、四萬五千萬廣大之人口、團結一致、本「有錢出錢、有力出力之旨、協助政府、救護傷病、自必能收彌補之效、</p>
<p>念餘月來壯烈精神</p>
<p>然念餘月來、前方英勇之將士、爲吾民族爭生存、飲彈茹血、所受之慘痛、絕非後方民衆想像之所能及、死者暴屍原野、塲者血肉糢糊、每遇主將一呼、創塲皆起、猶能鼓共餘勇、與奴爭頃刻之勝負、其壯烈之精神、誠可以泣鬼神而震天地、及重塲莫起、始退出戰塲、爲之裏紮担架、舁送後方醫治、政府固已盡其最大救護之力量矣、然而戰事愈激烈、叫負傷之將士愈多、救護之工作遂愈歷艱鉅、我民衆雖亦隨在參加救護工作、要非整個的統一的行動、其收效之微、以致傷病官兵、遺棄窮途、輾轉溝壑者有之、啼飢號寒、呻吟街巷者亦有之、此固非普遍之現象、要之、有一負塲士卒、遭此顚連痛苦、即係我政府與民衆、未能盡到救之職責、應共引爲莫大之恥辱、</p>
<p>救護存恤萬衆一心</p>
<p>須知政府已下長期抗戰之決心、若非日寇悔禍、退出我中華民國之領土、雖十年百年戰爭、亦在所不顧、因此戰士之精神激勵、物質之源源補充、在在有賴我前後方民衆之支撑、如傷病不救、視同陌人、匪惟有灰前綫將卒抗戰之心、且寒後方壯士從軍之膽、其影響抗戰前途、詎可言喻、故救護傷病、存恤有功、謂爲抗戰勝敗之關鍵、當非過言、同人等有鑒及此、爰發起組織傷兵之友社、希我社會團體、學校機關、一致加入尤賴我智識份子、社會先進、廣爲推動、各視力之所逮、或上前綫輸送、或在後方徵募、或赴醫院慰問、或對民衆宣傳、萬衆一心、羣力以赴、務使軍隊與民衆、打成一片、後方與前方、結成一環、在茲抗戰第二時期、絕不使負傷者、無一不獲救護、有功者、無一不蒙存恤、如此則最後勝利、指顧可待、謹啟、</p>

<p>有屋出頂</p>
<p>第二自訴人即知照趙侶靑、據趙云、亦係受中國女子中學校長王紫珠之託、欲霓屋擴充校舍、第二自訴人乃於三月廿六日、陪同王紫珠與敎務長王佩貞及趙侶靑等、同至被告家內看屋、據被告稱、此屋月租四百五十元、頂費九百五十元、王紫珠看屋結果、認爲滿意、約定决日交付定洋、屆時山第一自訴人又偕王紫珠·王佩貞·趙侶靑同至周超技處、</p>

<p>前杭州名律師朱鴻達之子朱鴻逵之姪朱銓、年近而立、曾受高等敎育、向在石家莊岳州等地海關服務、當民國二十六年朱銓曾向培成女校高材生浙江臨海女子陳守倫（現年二十八歲）追求結果竟即訂定婚約、旋於同年五月二日在上海新新酒樓舉行結婚典禮、自婚後、陳氏即追隨朱銓至任所陳亦一度</p>
<p>任職海關</p>
<p>後以海關規則、夫婦不能同時服務於海關、故陳即解職、夫婦之間、素稱和睦、詎最近朱忽染精神病症、因此來滬就醫、乃此時關房間情感突生裂痕、朱之家屬、亦拒絕陳與朱銓同居更不准其探望丈夫、雖經陳委託律師、歷次函請同居、及探望丈夫、然均遭</p>
<p>嚴予拒絕、陳不得已、乃向特一法院民庭對朱銓提起離婚之訴、同時並請求給付生活費五千元、共理由爲不堪虐待、惡意遺棄兩點、此案昨晨山桂裕推事開民三庭傳訊被告朱銓不到、由其母委律師到庭、聲明朱現因精神病就診於霞飛路虹橋療養院、故不能到庭應訴、並稱被告之</p>
<p>得精神病</p>
<p>共起因實由於原告云云、繼由陳守倫投稱、余前在培成求學時被告一再追求、始訂爲婚姻、乃自被告患病之後被告家庭間即任意遺棄、旣拒絕同居、復不准會夫一面雖曾歷次請求、均經被告之父及被告親函拒絕、現我雖暫時服務於江海關、月薪五十元、除房金十九元外、其餘衣食車費已覺</p>
<p>十分拮據</p>
<p>故對於訟費、實無能力繳付、請求准予訴訟救助至所請生活費、原本需二萬元、現暫訴判五千元、其請求此項生活費之根據、係被告於虐待我後、致我信函中所自承者、且查被告之精神病、業已醫愈、已向海關報到、更經</p>
<p>關醫認明</p>
<p>故今日之不到理由、實係推諉之詞、至我現確服務於海關、但係暫時性質、因被告一經開始服務、依例我即須退職云云、並呈出與被告父子往來之函件數通、以爲證明而被告方面之律師則稱、被告之病、實係尚未痊可、儘可飭醫檢騐、至拒絕原告之探望、係</p>

<p>囚恐被告再受刺激、而加重其疾病也、桂推事核供之下、以兩造間均屬世家、且均表示仍有繼續同居之可能、故本案宜進行和解、使美滿家庭、免遭破裂、乃宣告不定期改期、着兩造出外試行和解、</p>

<p>古人的詔：——從內之外者，調其內；從外之內者，治其外；從外之內，而盛於外者，先調其內，後治其外；從外之內而盛於內者，先治其外而後治其內；中外不相及，則治主病。（素問至眞耍大論）又「補上下者從之，治上下者逆之，以所在寒熱盛衰而調之。故曰上取下取，內取外取，以求其過。能毒者以厚藥；不勝毒者以薄藥。病在上取其下；病在下取其上；病在中旁取之。治熱以寒，溫而行之；治寒以熱，凉而行之；治溫以淸，冷而行之;治淸以溫，熱而行之；故消之削之，吐之下之，補之瀉之，久新同治。」（五常政大論）又：有在其標而求之於標；有在其本而求之於本；有在其本而求之於標；有在其標而求之於本。故治有取標而得者，有取本而得老，有逆取而得者，有從取而得者。治反爲逆，治得爲從。小大不利治其標，小大利治其本，病發而有餘，本而標之，先治其本，而後治其標。病發而不足，標而本之，先治其標，後治其本。謹察間甚，以意調之。（標本病傳論）又：何謂逆從，曰，逆者正治，從者反治，從少從多，觀其事也。反治何謂？曰：熱因熱用，寒因寒用，塞因塞用，通因通用，必伏其所主，而先其所因，其始則同，其終則異，可使破積，可使潰堅，可使氣和，可使必已」</p>
<p>以上所引，如是等等，在古籍中敷見不鮮，引在這一篇短文中，是一種生健的胚料。讀者一時或有感覺到一種不可名狀的奧妙，實在因古文簡要，須加以不少說明，方能領會。但在此處無暇一一加以說明，並且不能引證各家的註解以鋪張這篇幅。總之照前所引的種切，確然是一種巧妙的藝術手腕。倘然要解說中醫學是一種藝術的話，那末這些古語却好引用，較之陰陽五行的魔術咒語，高明萬倍，可稱中國醫學於不可宣示的奧妙中，却示後人以南針。故古籍亦曰：「治寒以熱，治熱以寒，方士不能繩墨，而更其道也。」</p>
<p>上面所引的，猶可說是漢代醫經的老話廢話，已不適於現代應用，然而朋代末期的醫師如李中梓所著之醫宗必讀，現尚爲時醫俗師所心維口誦的。有一篇名用藥須知內經之法論，「不妨抄在下面，以見前引漢代的醫經，不因年代的古老，而少貶其價値的，並可見中國醫學的藝術的應用，活活在時醫俗師的指頭之下，其文曰：</p>
<p>用藥之難，非順用之難，逆用之難也；非逆用之難，而與病情恰當之難也。今之醫師，知以寒治熱，以熱治寒，以通治塞，以塞治通，熱者熱之無遺，寒者寒之無遺而已矣！獨不聞諸經曰：「塞因塞用，通因通用，寒因熱用，熱因寒用，用熱遠熱，用寒遠寒，」則又何以說也？蓋塞因塞用者，若脾虛作脹，治以參朮，脾得補而脹自消也；通因通用者，若傷寒挾熱下利，或中有燥屎，用調胃承氣湯下之乃安；滯下不休，用藥湯通之而愈也；寒因熱用者，藥本寒也，而反佐之以熱：熱因寒用者，藥本熱也，而反佐之以寒，俾無拒格之患。所謂「必先其所中而伏其所因」也。用熱遠熱，用寒遠寒。如寒病宜投熱藥，熱病宜服寒藥，僅使中病而已，勿過用焉，過用則反爲藥傷矣。（鳳按：此處說解經文，語氣有不相値處，存疑！）如前諸法，非通達者，烏足以語此！故曰：「病無常形，醫無常方，藥無常品，順逆進退，存乎共時，神聖工巧，存乎其人，君臣佐使，存乎其用，……</p>
<p>李士材又於其苦欲補瀉論一文中有云：…善用藥者，不廢準繩，亦不囿於準繩。如熱應寒療，投寒而火熱反生；寒應熱治，進熱而沉寒轉甚，此喜攻增氣之害也。治寒有法，當益心陽，治熱有權，宜滋腎水，此求本化源之妙也。益心之陽，寒亦通行，强腎之陰，熱之猶可，此變化通神之法也。…</p>
<p>再小而言之，不論診病，而論用藥，時醫俗師所開方藥，其所得到於息息相傳之師承中，亦自有他們的巧妙，在各個執業者手指之下。醫言用藥：理血藥中加以氣藥，治風藥中先以養血，行水藥中，亦須理氣，理濕藥中亦加理氣，補益藥中加以消導，表散藥中加以緩劑，攻下藥中，輔以遵劑，表寒藥中，加以制劑，退熱藥中，加以和劑。他如寒熱相制，散歛相劑，表裏兼顧，上下相得，皆是一種小巧的藝術，不是頭痛醫頭，脚痛脚的簡單幼稗的成方所可比擬·何况加以複方奇方等等則其藝術巧妙，自在意中。</p>
<p>凡上所述，皆爲現代醫師所熟知，故其治病，一證到手，將整個的醫術打量在病人的身上，何去何從，自能得心應手。所以陰陽五行等話可以丟在一邊，眞是術士欺人之言，無　學術宏旨的。至論中國醫學在陰陽學說發生之前，已早有其經：在陰陽學說發生之後，也自有其進步。說也話長，恕不多絮在這裏。</p>

<h3 id="c70">處理創傷之法則 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 朱克聞</p>
<p>德國塲科學會，應全國工業從業員聯會，及全國農業從業員聯合會之請求，於去年十月二十六日在明興開會，參加者有Schmiedeu，ZurVerth，Heller，Maguus，Bochler，Buerklede．la　Ccamp諸氏，特擬訂「處理創傷之法則」，以爲醫界之參考。譯者以爲國內傷科事件，無論在戰時或戰後，其發生之决數，必將迅速增高，而醫師處理創傷之時，却缺乏相當之準繩，該會所擬各節，簡單明確，特譯之以供同道。（原文見上月十五日「外科家」雜誌第六期。）</p>
<p>甲、創傷之處理</p>
<p>一·整齊之普通輕微創塲，無嚴重之傳染嫌疑者，均須立刻由醫師處理之，並須每日在醫師監督之下。惟此類創傷，無需手術。</p>
<p>二·除此以外，其他各種創傷，醫師均須以最嚴格最激進之態度對付之。受傷後六至八小時以內之創塲，可稱爲「新鮮創傷」，然此限度，均以發生之情形與受傷之部位而定。有時亦可延至十二小時以內。各地醫師並得按照其經騐，在其服務之地點測定此項時間。</p>
<p>三·醫師治療之目的，在澈底用手術切除全部創傷面，以及於創傷之深部。</p>
<p>四·一切藥膏包紮，不能替代手術，亦不能輔助手術之不足。</p>
<p>五·淺而易見之創傷，在施行嚴格之切除術之後，得稀疏縫合之。若創口較深，如有筋肉創塲，則縫合之外，必留一排膿之處。</p>
<p>六·深而不易視察之創塲，或因解剖部位關係，不得澈底施行切除術，而僅可用手術割除受汚及腐敗之組織者，以及認爲有極大傳染危險與組織，曾受化學損害者，概不得縫合。凡有灣有底之創塲，均須排膿。但有時亦得略縫數針，以作繫維之用。</p>
<p>七·創傷之最易傳染者爲嚙塲，爪傷，有毒之手術塲，化騐室創傷，獸醫創傷，魚肆屠塲創塲，陰溝河道工作者之創傷等等，創傷之受化學損害者，如墨水筆尖刺破等是也。</p>
<p>八·新鮮之關節破裂，須於施行切除術之後，至少得將皮膚縫合之。開放之骨折，如骨組織不十分破碎，亦無傳染危險之汚垢，則可將於創塲切除術之後，縫合。吾則不可縫合。</p>
<p>九·創傷處理之後，必須絕對安置，河間斷。</p>
<p>十·創塲切除術或其他處置創傷之手術，必需有相當之設備，（消毒）及充分之外科經騐。</p>
<p>乙、破作風</p>
<p>一·上述之嚴格創塲切除術，爲預防破傷風之先決條件</p>
<p>二·凡有破塲風　之創塲，如街道塲害，農　或　　創傷，穿過鞋襪之足部創傷，汽車輾傷，開放破碎塲以及木刺塲等等，均須注射相當分量之破傷風抗毒血淸以預防之。</p>
<p>三·破塲風血淸注射之必要性，可依當地破傷風發生之情形，斟的施行。</p>
<p>四·破傷風血淸，頗能預防破傷風之發生，至相當程度，但不能絕對擔保其不致發生。在德國境內破傷風傳染之危險甚小，反之，注射破傷風血淸，爲並非絕對無危險之事，故未注射血淸，不能絕對的認爲醫師之過失。（譯者按：根據本埠四郊，戰事之經騐，彈片創傷後，傳染破傷風者估計的有千份之五，故注射血淸預防，本人認爲絕對必要）。</p>
<p>丙、氣壞疽</p>
<p>平時外科對於氣壞疽之經騐極少，創傷切除術，亦爲防止嫌氣菌發育之最有效方法，排膿管必須安置。據英法之戰事經騐，血淸極有效，但氣壞疽之血淸療法，迄今尚未成熟。</p>

<p>— 問纘曾</p>
<p>生平三大著作</p>
<p>一八七〇——一八七一年德法戰爭，考霍氏投自願軍，於休戰歸途中，被任爲Bomst縣醫官，公餘之暇，私人設一小小實騐室，研究脾脫疽病Anthrax　Milzbrand蓋斯時人獸遭其殃者，實不可勝數，二十年來諸醫師均欲探究此問題，考霍氏豈能例外·一八七六年，發表其多年之試騐結果：如何探尋脾脫疽病菌，培養法，及其消滅方法，由此大衆公認，「因」定之病菌，致成一定之疾患。」</p>
<p>由考霍氏之導示，後起者遂漸發現如傷寒瘧疾麻瘋等之病原體，彼於其私人實騐室中，再從事研究破傷風病，諸多困難，而未予成功。一八八〇年被詔入皇家衛生處，從事工作，斯時則以設備完好，進步多多，如其發明之水蒸氣消毒方法，至今尤爲細菌工作之所不可缺少者。</p>
<p>一八八二年三月二十四日在柏林生理學會上，考霍氏報告彼已發現結核桿菌，人類始明瞭結核病實有其病原體，絕非由於營養障礙，他若皮膚結核，骨結核，亦爲此桿菌所致成。</p>
<p>翌年，（一八八三）受任船醫，其所以顧任斯睵者，非爲享受航海樂趣，實因便於研究諸熱帶傳染病也；會菲洲霍亂盛行，大有蔓及印度埃及而達歐洲之概，考霍氏逐組纎赴菲控虎烈拉隊，絕不懼炎日威逼，於設俌最簡陋之化騐室內，得虎烈拉弧菌，乃由於飲水之傳染。繼則研究牛瘟疫Rinder．Pest於菲洲及人瘟疫（即黑死病）Pest　det　Menschen於印度，證明瘟疫之發生，實由於瘟菌所致，該菌繁殖於鼠身，由跳蚤而傳播人身；繼而又組織采采蠅病Texa—tse　Fliege及Texas—Fieber牛疫考察隊。</p>
<p>一八八五年被任爲柏林大學衛生教授中，同時繼續其研究工作，非若一般殺死書之先生可比，一八九一年受任爲其一特設之細菌學院院長，即今日柏林Fehrer街上之Bobert　Koch學院是也。考霍一氏當私自勉勵曰：不放鬆！其所以能屢有新發現者，實亦因其不稍放鬆也。（完）</p>

<p>港方尚不斷有供給</p>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、悉無變化、暗盤情況、頗形平定、市價則略帶軟化、蓋因德士古油公司兼其他洋行等結款頻繁、加以日紗廠與西商沙遜等亦一度扒結、雖則港電續來供塞、但因外行如滙豐等祇肯照掛牌價維持、故結果英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇六二五、交易平平、港匯因錢兌業與洋行等買意極濃、加之中外銀行賣胃頗淡、故繼續猛緊、</p>

<p>市上最近又有謠傳四行鈔票將行緊縮，而以發鈔未統一前所接收之各商業銀行鈔票在市行用，以免掉取外滙，此說由來，疑是報載收儲各銀行存鈔乏說所附會。據查各銀行付款之用舊時商業銀行鈔票（雜鈔）者容或有之。但此種情况，以在滬戰發生前後，各存戶紛紛提取存款，鈔票一時頓感缺乏，舊鈔票流出遂多，最近以來，各銀行付存款，用舊鈔相付者有之，但付四行鈔票者亦有之，市上旣對於各鈔無岐視，固不成問題。至外商銀行認定中中交農四鈔爲法幣，亦不自今日始。將來事態演進如何，甚而至於發行流通券，以抵抗無準備之鈔票，或即以雜鈔之作用等於流通券，在目前尚爲揣測之談，亦不必措意。</p>
<p>銅元缺乏，竟有人爲某方作辨護者，謂中央亦有收取，此固見於去年中國方面之通告，係指戰區或內地而言，以防將來爲人所租用，其事實如何，但觀內地銅元較上海豐富多多，而上海銅元在中國軍隊撤退之後，將及一年，亦並不感覺缺乏，可知其不然。直至袋近半年以來，方見羅掘已窮之狀，故如其說，中央目前所收藏之銅兀，旣無出運之可能，存儲於上海，究非得計，且何必待至一年之後，環境日非之下，再起收買，而事實所在，明係那一方面所爲，又何必抬出「中央」爲之作替身耶。可嘆！</p>

<p>— 維湘</p>
<p>一九三〇年的夏天，在浙江省的省會杭州，創辦了一所新興的學校，這便是以造成社會敎育人才，普及民衆敎育爲職志的省立民衆敎育實驗學校。當時，浙江全省各縣都有靑年學子前去投考，我便是該校社會敎育行政專修科所錄取的五十三個同學中的一個。</p>
<p>在民敎實校一年短促的求學期中，尚仲衣先生做了我們全校生活指導部的主任，同時，尚先生父兼任我們這一科裏教育心理學，現代文化等敎課。尚先生那種誠摯的態度，孜孜不倦的敎學精神，是深得我們全班同學們深切的敬愛的。</p>
<p>尚先生的性格和談吐，處處顯出他是一個十足「北方人」。爽直，懇摯，大公無私。他的敎育思想是趨向於革命的。尚先生同時又是一個非常好學的敎育學者，除了敎育外，他對於社會科學和自然科學的書物，都非常嗜讀。近幾年來，他爲了要直接閱讀蘇聯的進步的敎育書籍，曾努力學習俄文，聽說，結果他巳達到了如期的目的。由此，足見他好學的一斑了。</p>
<p>尚先生的文章，文筆剛健而質樸，絕沒有那種彎彎曲曲，扭扭揑揑的筆調，道正說明了他的爲人。民國二十年春，尚先生抨擊兒童讀物中的「鳥言獸語」，掀起了一塲有名的論戰，從那些可寳貴的論文裹，我們可以看出他思想的純正，文筆的質樸無華，論戰不越出討論學術範圍的一種學者態度。</p>
<p>尚先生對於兒童讀物是很有研究的人。他在美國時，曾就這一問題，讀了不少書，下過一番研究，他在哥倫比亞大學所做的博士論文，便是有關兒童讀物的。在全校那麼多的同學中，尚先生對我是比較的更親切的，這原因，大概是爲了我對兒童讀物，也有所「同好」的緣故吧！尚先生給予我的誘掖獎進，是我所永不能忘懷的。</p>
<p>民國二十年的春天，中華兒童敎育社在上海舉行年會，尚先生由杭赴滬參加。在席上，他發表了一篇抨擊兒童讀物中的「鳥言獸語」的演說，因而引起了跟吳研因先生在申報敎育欄的一番論戰。</p>
<p>自這决論戰以後，中國兒童讀物發生了一個轉變：鳥言獸語的故事，公主王子的童話，逐漸地不爲人所重視，開始走向沒落之路；同時，新型的知識性的科學的，社會的兒童讀物，代替了舊型讀物的（文藝性的讀物也有了顯著的進步）地位。猶憶當時尚先生在論戰時，要找一些國內所出合乎他理想的兒童讀物，眞是鳳毛麟角；但到現在，中國出版界中却儘有幾種優良的讀物了。（如法布耳的科學故事，蘇聯伊林的著作，中國都已有譯本。近年以來，國人自己創作的兒童讀物，也有不少優秀的作品。）這個開展，雖然一半是時代的演進，但要沒有那一决的論戰，我以爲是決不會轉　得那麼快的。</p>
<p>這對於中國兒童讀物的發展，無疑的是一個偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>民國二十年夏，尚先生繼任校長，我也已畢了業，在母校做事。因此，我常有機會銀尚先生討論兒童讀物的取材和寫作，使我蒙受了很多益處。一年半後，我到上海來担任一個兒童刊物的　編，尚先生則不多久後，也到國防前綫的北平任敎去了。</p>
<p>尚先生是一個熱情的愛國者，一個不屈不撓的民族鬥士，他到了北平，目擊當地環境日非，國　日重，他對學生們的愛國運勸，寄以極大的同情和贊助，因而下獄有十七天之久。</p>
<p>幾年來，因爲彼此都勞人草草，我們間的音信是久疏了。抗戰爆發以後，聽說尚先生在兩廣方面，從事敎育事業和動員民衆的工作；但那裏知道，今天翻開國際日報的現實」，竟會發見尚先生在廣東東江豐順覆車逝世的噩耗呢！</p>
<p>亦凄風苦雨中，展讀「現實」上的追悼文字，一邊父回憶起以往的經歷，益增我無限的悲痛</p>
<p>尚先生在生前，奉獻了他全副的精力，從事敎育事業；抗戰發動以後，他更領導青年學生，深入農村，喚起民衆，推動救國高潮，直到奉獻了他的生命給國家民族爲止。</p>
<p>尚先生是逝世了，敎育界損失了一位前進的導師，國家民族少了一個戰士。但尚先生的事業和精神是將永永存在的，我們後死的青年們，該怎樣負起尚先生卸下來的重担繼續奮鬥啊！（義賣獻金）</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>——戰地追記——</p>
<p>一到了戰地，什麽都不能預定。我們原想在宋埠留宿一宵，便往潢川訪問李宗仁將軍，順道考察一下豫鄂邊境的民衆動員工作。因爲戰事進入了第二階段，展開在前面的鬥爭，不是陣地戰，而爲山岳戰；也就是說，在戰略上必須轉變到廣大的流動戰，以期收得持久的良好戰果。豫鄂皖三省邊境，爲流動網的重要根據地；蜿蜒起伏的大別山脈，從平靖關東走，一直伸入了安徽，跟皖出脈手拉手似的接聯着，而環峙於西部的大洪山脈，尤其是鄂北的主要戰塲。然而在陳參議的卡車辦到以後，事情又發生了變化；原因是，我們一羣中的吳小姐，忽然接到北大舊同學從武昌寄來的快信說，馮治安將軍即日要到麻城，而且有一部份隊伍候令開入皖西，政訓處需要人帮忙，可以去跟他會見。</p>
<p>一那麽，我們先往麻城，行吧？一吳小姐徵求着人家的同意。</p>
<p>經過相常時問的考慮，才始決定下來，在高熱度的陽光底下，爬上了卡車；路面非常窄狹，非常崎嶇，所以顚簸得特別厲害，雖則短短的幾十里路程，連心臟也有點震動了。</p>
<p>提到麻城，不由你不記起過去的故事：這座遙望皖西的古城，在一九三一年的秋天，就是向「赤區』進縏的营壘，城外四郊的高地，還遺留着不少碉堡。常時『赤區」的中心點健立於金家寨，現在已經改爲立煌縣治，而且負起了流動戰的重大使命。大別山脈的一支鐵流，自然會泛濫起來，咆哮起來，跟！「赤區」時代同樣的發揮它的威力，如果歷史可爲前例的話。</p>
<p>費了一小時的功夫，把司令部找到了，但不幸得很，馮將軍還沒有到，政訓處也不在這裏，乘興而來，却撲了一空，便臨時變更計劃，作附近鄉村的訪問，由聯保處的介紹，連續訪問了七個鄉村。</p>
<p>「我們爲什麽要發動自衛戰爭？」</p>
<p>「爭獨立，爭自由，爭生存！」</p>
<p>「如果我們的軍隊退出了武漢，你們怎麽辦？」</p>
<p>「打流動戰。」</p>
<p>「你們沒有傢伙，怎樣打得起來？」</p>
<p>「有，有，有，他們會送上的！不，耜頭釘耙也打得來，祇要大家不怕死！」</p>
<p>這是民衆抗戰意識的測駝，同時，即爲潛伏着的　大力量。他們認識的正確，情緒的熱烈，團結的堅强，不能不使人詫爲奇蹟，而衷心地佩服起來。</p>
<p>「誰說勝利不屬於我們呢？」吳小姐在訪問後所下的結論。</p>
<h3 id="c87">（二）太陽如同新郎出洞房 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>詩人說：「太陽如同新郎出洞房，又如勇士歡然奔路，他　天這邊出來，繞到天那邊，沒有一物被隱藏不得他的熱氣。」每常曉日初昇，太陽似乎在彩霞上含笑而出，要形容他似新婦，則不够嫵媚，著看他如新郎，則言之恰合，但常他如火球似的高懸時，與共說他是勇士，再寗說他是武夫。但有時候，人對於他幻想：爲甚麽他要盡夜不停的奔跑？誰叫他這樣辛苦？他爲甚麽不罷工？假使一旦，他被別一個宇宙偷了去，這世界的人類，將要怎樣？——我對於幻想者，謹贈下述的聖經：「起初神創造天地，自從造天地以來，神的永能和神性是明明可知的，雖是眼不能見，但藉着所造之物，就可以曉得，呌人無可推諉。」由此可知，神是宇宙之主，祂創造太陽，他是人類生命的泉源，祂不但賜給太陽，以維持人類物質的生命，祂愛世人，甚至將祂的獨生子（耶穌）也賜給他們，叫一切信他的，不至滅亡，反得永遠的生命，——上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號。</p>
<h3 id="c88">細菌及麻醉劑戰爭（上）  J．MurrayＭ　天任譯 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>晚近一個比國科學家宜佈說，細菌將於下次大戰被用爲殺人的利器，這使得億萬人士不寒而慄，同時引起了無數專家們熱烈地討論。</p>
<p>法國報上曾傳說，德國化學實騐室，正日夜從事培養億兆具有不同毒性的各類細菌，預備用來掃減敵國人民。許多法國化學家還莊重地將這些致人死命的毒菌分門別類，並指明每種細菌所能引起的病害。一些英國的科學家，雖未置信這些傳說，但對於細菌會被用於下次大戰的一問題，都嚴肅地點頭—很難預告。</p>
<p>這些將出現於下次大戰的致死武器的秘密尚未洩露時。人們一提到牠就戰慄不已，大家都厭惡談論這種會絕滅億萬人類的細菌戰。但歐洲許多報章，現在深感過去太忽略這一問題的錯誤。因爲一開始討論這問題後，（雖然略覺過遲）就得到可信的結論，認爲細菌作爲武器，所能招致的損失極有限。</p>
<p>（一）施用細菌極受限制</p>
<p>英法兩國的專家們，都堅信施行細菌戰，較諸使用別的武器，受限制更甚，已發現的細菌，各國的科學家都知道了。牠們的習性特性都曾深刻地研究過，並且分類記錄下來。毒氣是能在試騐室中製造的，但細菌—即使能培養出可以掃滅人類的新種—却難大量地孵養。即使有某國的軍部企圖利用已知的細菌作戰，仍然有許多困雜存在。</p>
<p>傳佈疾病方法有二種：</p>
<p>第一個方法，由於個人間的直接接觸，而傳遞疾病。因此如要將疾病廣佈敵國，使牠屈膝，則首先須犧牲無數本國軍隊，使他們感染疾病，再秘密派往敵國。用這種方法去打擊敵人，犧牲顯然太重。因爲這種「媒介」即使能完成其使命，但敵人能隔離病人並設法撲滅這種流行病害。</p>
<p>第二種方法是，用蚤，鼠等爲媒介將疾病汪入敵國。用這種方法，則軍中須携帶數百萬蚤，鼠而行。且須是感染桿狀菌性的肺病或黑死症。</p>
<p>（二）鼠輩不能完成使命</p>
<p>常我將蚤，鼠是否能用以傳播疾病於敵國一問題，向一個瑞士化學家提出時，他對我說不可能。因爲蚤鼠並無國族意識。經騐過第一次大戰的人，當能證明牠們是不會分淸敵友的。困此蚤鼠不分界線的傳散疾病，將令雙方戰線上都盛行傳染病。</p>
<p>一位英國的細菌學者約翰華哂（John　Fawcett）說如無下述原因，則以上二種方法都能絕滅敵人。</p>
<p>他說：「每種疾病的細菌，只要知道了，都能用一種血淸去抵抗牠。這種血清是感染這種疾病的動物血液製成的，具有避疫効能。因而已知的各種傳染病發生時，或發生之前，可以迅速地大量製出血淸以减除病害。</p>
<p>「只有一些未知其種類的細菌，才眞能絕減人種族。如果有那一國的細菌研究部能秘密地培養出一種未知名的疫病細菌，並能製出血淸，以注射本國人民，則那個國家就眞能用這種不能防制的疫病去滅亡敵人。然而這種可能性，似乎仍屬渺茫。」</p>
<p>（三）以麻醉藥爲武器的戰爭。</p>
<p>那些討論及下决戰爭中所用的武器的專家們，都堅信麻醉藥將得優勝。一位英國作家卡兵特（John　Carpenetr）是專門研究戰爭武器的，曾在他的一篇文章上說，麻醉劑可以大規模地用作戰爭武器，而且使用簡便。他叙述使用麻醉劑的情形如下：</p>

<p>與歌的幻想，</p>
<p>到赤熱的營地上，</p>
<p>吐出忿恨的燄火，</p>
<p>常同寳劍在一起，</p>
<p>效學着戰士的笑。</p>

<p>咋夜的露冷；</p>
<p>今朝的霜重：</p>
<p>軍號嘹亮地揚着，</p>
<p>朝着遠的山林。</p>
<p>抖落了征衣上的薄冰，</p>
<p>我喊着：「遠方的雙親啊</p>

<p>兒子正等待着戰鬥，</p>
<p>心中充滿了希望。」</p>
<p>戰馬</p>
<p>我的戰馬跟着我，</p>
<p>有如是一個好友，</p>
<p>當我衝鋒而受塲，</p>
<p>牠立直在我身邊，</p>
<p>牠的鼻子嗅嗅我，</p>
<p>好像說：「起來！戰士，</p>
<p>你還沒有打退敵人，</p>
<p>必須再去衝一陣。」</p>

<p>— 熙</p>
<p>（去年十月十六日有白俄）特利福諾夫等六人，在上海結伴同乘遊船維斯拉號出發法租界曰俄義勇隊服務，間辭職加入此行。日前本埠有人接到特氏於五月有十一日由菲列錄數段如下，以便非英美籍的冒險家讀了，知道不享有這種便利，乘遊船或民船橫渡大在洋，萬一不幸，在日本地方登陸，便不免遭受酸心粗暴的待遇，雖鮁這種國籍便利，有也沒有多大用處。）</p>
<p>遊船</p>
<p>由　出發的第四天，在風　中大受損傷。我們因為須立即修理，不得不在台灣附近青　小島伊希迦克斯（譯音）登　。不料日本憲兵瞥見，立將我們扣留，指找們替英美做間　。我們求將遊船請一駛過的汽船拖入港內，他們並不理睬，我們把　　　報所載遊船由濕出發　　　　稿給他看，也沒有效果，他們反說我們在四天中駛行六百為荒唐之談。</p>
<p>我們在　禁的四個月中，猶如處身地獄。我第圖將同伴所受　拷問詳情寫下，那筆向乎從我手指間落地。自從我們六人被　後，裝有貴重設備的那　遊船，不由我　管，任令小販們攫取船中的一切物品。後來我們知道警察也借以自肥，我們的罐頭物品和全　炊具，都不見了。</p>
<p>憲兵</p>
<p>迫令我們把所有的美　換他們的日元，美金一元只換日金兩元。不久我們的資斧告罄，於是警察便毫不猶豫地處分我們的最佳物品，至一無所剩而已。衣服，皮鞋，　錶，部為警察長所昨，每件物品給我們日金一元至三元不等。某次風雨，警察問我們「借去一的雨衣，筆來一個把也沒有再見。致了極點，我們的行李「拍賣」所得的款項，警察也來麻煩，開始「借用」了。最不堪的，是那個卑鄙狡滑無情的舌人某氏。</p>
<p>我們在兩個月中曾受仔細的盤　，每次臉上總受巴掌拳頭一兩下不等。後來警局決定解送我們到日本附近某大島的那恰（譯　）港，和日本囚徒同處在一間囚室中。那裏　日本警察較有禮貌，較有慈心。日本囚徒似犯感染布爾希維主義之罪，他們不分　夜，逐一被押出空。我們能遙聞呼喊之聲原來那時正在審問　夜間守衛熟睡之時，日本囚徒口吹着第三國際歌曲，其聲響應全　。</p>
<p>拘禁</p>
<p>滿四個月，當局不願再給養我們，因為我們已成了他們一種担負。這時我們的行李都失去了，　中又空無一文，不昨不把遊船出賣，然而誰來買呢？這船和岩石相撞，已四個月，無人照料，螺絲的推動機已損壞了，馬達已完全不靈動了，所以出賣是不可能，而我們又浰不動身。</p>
<p>在我們離日的一星期前，才許我們寫信，我們同伴中有一位波蘭人，他將困苦情形陳告駐東京的波蘭領事，懇請解　相助，寫信時曾預日憲兵監視，信中的內容，曾受嚴密審查。盡兵說明我們的「寄宿」費，和其他一切用費，都由日政府付　，等收到波蘭事的款項時，須　數償還</p>
<p>未幾，波蘭領事送來覆信，說　需的款項，將即照送。日當　得悉之下，便判我繳罰鍰日金三百元，那罪狀是我們遊船擅入豬區。同時又悉我們同伴中有三人以賣藝為業，便令三人在某戲塲奏藝，我們奏藝數天，共　　百日元　，那是收入毛數的百分之十五，但到付款那天，結算之後，我們不但分文無着，反欠戏塲二十九元。这顧示我们辛苦愈久，积欠便愈多。我们辛苦愈久，積欠便愈多。我們的伙食，每天規定兩元，我們用這錢只能夠買點甜薯麵粉，和一些脂肪，我們因為得不到烟劃，甚為快怏。</p>
<p>戲場</p>
<p>的生活，結果使我們喪失所餘的衣服等物。波蘭大使聞悉我們的困苦情形，便向日外務省交涉，日外務省即向他保證，將我們所失的物品尋獲歸還。等到我們回至遊船時，見原有的清水五桶，只剩了兩桶，其餘如盤碟臺罐等，和全套炊具，以及點照片的紀念册，都已不冀而飛了。</p>
<p>遊船的狀態，眞屬可僯，處處是洞也，馬達和推動機，都已損壞。費了日多七十元，才得整下理」下，那並非全部整理，不過使它能夠駛離日本　「天堂」罷了。</p>
<p>現在我們已到了菲列賓，豫備開往澳大利亞，我們住過日本後，更感覺菲列賓人的彬彬有禮，態度友好，我們和日人相處的經騐，將長留腦海，而為一種可怖的夢魔！（譯密勒氏評論報）</p>

<p>— 任明發</p>
<p>到難民收容所去放映電影，這是値得推行的，因為在難民收容所裏的　胞。他們神經，都是受着了過分的刺激，一切都失去了本性。我們將要怎樣，才能减少他們的心的苦悶，剷除他們精神上的痛苦，增進他們對於抗戰信念，添補他們不足的思想，打消他們少數人不潔的心靈，使他們明白國家今日所處的立塲。</p>
<p>我曾經在難民收容所裏，看過的四部影處，簡略的寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）是滑稽片：描寫一個人酒醉後的瘋狂，　了不和的笑話，躭誤了大事，毀破了家　。使得　個難胞的苦臉上，都露出了笑容。</p>
<p>（二）是衛生片：部解一個人全身的骨髓，與行血的經過。同時指示着劇列運動和不運動的劣點。及普通流血的防備法。</p>
<p>（三）是卡　片：內容是許多米老鼠，不堪受老貓的壓迫，在忍無呆忍的環境裏，偶鮁的　　起來，連絡了南北的米老鼠，結果將老貓打死了。</p>
<p>（四）是生產片：在美國的某一個地方，有許多人民，每當春季的時候，將魚的卵，放入海裏，經過　當的時候，放入海裏的卵，都變成了很大的魚。　　捕來的魚裏的卵，如同前法泡製。至於魚，皆用科學的方法製成，裝入罐頭，售於市上。如此的生產，效率是都麼的驚人啊！</p>
<p>上述的四部影片，獻映在大衆的眼前，敎訓着我們，要團結，能夠得到勝利。要生產，能夠得到生活。以及，每個人必須知道的普通常識。</p>

<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>提倡婦女職業　訓練服務人才</p>
<p>上海婦女敎育館是一個摔倒進婦女敎育的機關，館赴在華龍路五十四號，和中華職業敎育社相隔不遠，法國公園也近在　尺。</p>
<p>在上海這磁一個都市之中，婦女至少在百萬以上，而從事婦女敎育工作的團體機關是太少了。像上海婦女敎育館，可以算是努力婦敎的一個機關，而値得我們介紹的。</p>
<p>就我們所知道的，婦女敎育館的工作，範圍也是很廣，除了舉行演講或　　婦女的書畫等作品餐，最重要的工作，是摔倒進婦女的補習敎育。他們所設的婦女職　補習學校，科目很多：像國文，英文，算術，刺　，簿記，打字，鋼琴，珠算，會話，縫　等，全是有關婦女　業敎育的。現在利用業餘的時間，去補習各種科止的婦女很多。</p>
<p>婦女敎育館不僅　有婦女職　補習學校，更有服務人員訓練班。根據敎學做合一的主張，從實際工作中訓練婦女敎育服務人才。最近適　該館第七屆招考期內，凡是自十六歲到二十五歲而尚未結婚的女子，身心健全，志願終身服務婦女敎育事業的，都可報名應考的。</p>
<p>訓練的時間，依各人所受的敎育淺深而不同：初中畢業或有相當程度者訓練三年：高中疑業一年半以上者訓練　年；高中畢業者訓練一年；大學疑業者訓緡半年。訓練的期間，學膳宿費完全免收的，成績良好的還可給予津貼及獎金。訓練期滿，正式起薪，最低每月三十五元，並供給膳宿，以後根據服務成績，年彈簧加俸。</p>
<p>今年招考，第一次五月二十一日，第二次六月十八日，考試的科目：分國主，英文，算學，黨識，以上為第一試；而演說，談話，體格檢查是第二試。一經錄取，就可照規定日期進館。不過日後成績過分惡劣，被認為不堪造就者　是會令其退學的。</p>

<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重縍良綠</p>
<p>可知畢有湊巧，當趙樂天在這次夜襲受傷的當兒，天個傳訛，說時趙樂天已經是壯烈殉國了。尤其是對方的報紙，不說自己的輜　車被奪，官軍等的被殲滅，却只說那一隊的游擊隊被他們　蕰了，他們的隊長趙樂天也陣亡了。潘佩英的父親，看見了這一節新聞紀事，很為得意，便把那一張報紙，給他女兒去瞧。因想倘然我僅不過聽業這　一個消息，說與女兒聽，她也許不相信，以為這或者是我揑造出來的，以斷女兒之念。此刻報紙上登載，是個確克實實的消息，不但是淪陷區裏的報紙登載，連舊海的報紙也有登載的。說他：忠勇救國，壯烈犧牲，可異他怎樣一位有志的青年，那是　不會差的了。她給這張報與女兒看時，還嚕嚕囌囌說了許多不入耳之言。他說：　這個小子我早知他是不得好死的。打仗自有軍人，要你們學生出來幹麼？那都是受了共產黨的煽惑。共產黨就是無男無女，都要出來當兵。他們稱之為紅軍。現在死了倒也乾凈了，不然，回頭來也許帶累別人咧，什麼游　隊，都是共產黨想出來的新花樣，用來擬　鄉下人。所以我早先就不許你與他往來，後來他還你煞有倡事的寫信來，幸虧早懷他拒絕通信，我是早知道他沒有好強求果的，此刻佻也該　悟了吧？』潘佩英的父親，算是　　女兒，一面也借此絕了女兒之心，以後可以另有打算。誰知潘佩英聽到了這具消息，心如刀割，因想：完了！這一切都完了！以前聽了父親之言，受了他的壓迫，原為一時之計，恐怕趙樂天遭了他們的　手。預德以後總有相見之日是，可以慢慢地和他說明，只要幾名話和他一說，他也未有不相信。所以即使家中監視很嚴，我也暫時陷忍，因為望昨見這個時局是不會長久的，我　大家年青，總有相見之日。不想他竟就為國犧牲了，他接到了我那時拒絕他的信，不要以為　眞個拒絕了他。大家沒有說明的機會，而他也再沒有信來。飲恨茹痛，一瞑不視，這是如何傷心的事呀！（一三五）</p>

<p>二十世紀福斯公司的金髪電影明星格露麗絲都（Gloia　Strart）和她的夫君著名電影編劇家希克門（A　　Sheekmen）環游全球，昨晨八時，乘俄羅斯皇后號到達上海，在這裏觀光一星期，然後乘輪赴港，再勾留約一星期，然後取道西貢與荷屬東印度，前往歐洲。</p>
<p>最先歡迎絲都女士的是上海影迷的「代表」，—兩個年輕的西籍女學生，她們和英文大美晚報的記者，在絲都女士剛到滬的早上便宜到華柳懋飯店會見這位女明。這兩個女學生羞人答答地，漲紅了臉，把朱色的臂鐲脫下來贈給絲都女士，並歡迎她快樂地在這裏觀光，絲都女士受之有愧，就把這兩個影迷的姓名住址記了下來，答允送照片給他們。</p>
<p>希氏和他的夫人現在還沒決定在滬游歷的詳細計劃，他倆第一次的應酬，是曾寫過一本烹飪書，名呌「中國人的吃」的劉夫人，請希氏伉儷來吃午飯，一嚐眞正口國菜餚的風味，絲都女士和他的丈夫便很高興地接受了劉夫人的邀請；英文大美晚報已和西人馬迪氏不名招待希氏伉儷在明後天午後，到閘北憑弔毀於砲火的戰跡</p>
<p>絲都女士對於上海的夜生活顯然是很關懷的她郁：關於這「東方的巴黎」的歡娛地點，聽得多了，離開上海以前，要到各游藝塲和夜總會暢游一番，但是不想在上海多買東西。</p>

<h3 id="c98">為「胡琴槪論」　解答幾個問題 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>胡琴槪論自本刋發表之後，有人問我許多問題，我似乎應當再加以說明。不過有人問：什麽呌作「對位法」？那是西樂上的名詞，倘要詳細知道，可讀專門講對位的書。（如口華書局有一本對譜音樂「這裏不便談論，因地位有限，而且我不是西樂專門研究者。還有人問：什麽呌作外推裏帶？這也很多難郁，這是一種艱難的弓法，非常難使。這是王少卿先生所發明的，他並沒有名目，所謂外推裏帶，是我擬的名詞，不一定要會的，在文字上我沒有方法來敎人家，眞是抱歉。</p>
<p>有人說胡琴的技巧是要的，思想又怎樣講？這很容易講，技術（有形）是思想（無形）的表演。故完美的思想，非要有完美的技術來表演。單有技術，而思想不高，那就末沒有價値了。單有思想，而沒有技術，那末不能收到好的結果。譬如說，孫佐臣的胡琴就是技術超過了思想。而我的蒙師陳道安先生是思想超過了技術，故而陳先生敎我東西，往往不能應用。（他自己亦不能應用）。終於為了思想太高之故，技術上發生許多問題，便不能表演了。王少卿先生敎我的，亦因為我的技術不够應用，實在差得太遠了—不能表演，雖我我十分下苦功練習，在精神方面總談不到。倘若比較起來，那末他的手上彷彿是有機器一般的，發音來得生動矯捷，我是一棵萎黃的枯草。</p>
<p>還有人問我是否有唱片？那末我告訴你，百代公司麗歌牌有郭效靑的女起解，那二胡是我拉的。在技術上，我自己覺得比以前好些。在「寃枉難辯」下面的過門裏，用一個下把，因我慢慢上去的，而胡琴竟直接用高音，因此並不動聽。打鼓的亦稍覺慌忙。在第三面亦用下把。胡琴照拉，祇在我的二胡上用下把，有好些音是二人不同的。有人聽得非常滿意。可惜胡琴又稍嫌慢了一些。這是我自己編撰的譜與拉法，上下把的調動，亦並不很容易，但短時期中，有此成績，總算過得去。</p>
<p>我或者要着手編撰胡琴講義，但一時似乎尚不需要，並且關於照片等收錄未全。還有一層，我近來患着心痛症，亦恐未必能有完善的出品，粗製濫造去騙人，好像是不應當做的事情。</p>
<h3 id="c99">偽君子觀後 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 覺</p>
<p>新演劇社第二週公演</p>
<p>看了新演劇社發表的「我們的信念」之後，足以見到他們有對於劇運的信念和決心。</p>
<p>在環境和財力的限制下，短短的時期裏，新演劇社已樹立了她的根蒂。十一日是該劇社第二週假座卡爾登大戲院公演莫里哀的「偽君子」。這齣戲劇的題材是最精粹的社會實相的描寫，儘管情節不大錯綜複雜，而它底演出的效果終能抓住觀眾的心。</p>
<p>現在我們來檢視一下「偽君子」的故事：白雪剛最信託的朋友戴度甫，表面上是拘謹不過的人，平素滿口仁義道德，然而在白家差不多沒有一個人不憎惡他，因為他們深知戴度甫的虛偽，而戴度甫又是一個奸猾陰險居心叵測的人，他為了要達到和白雪剛的女兒瑪麗結婚的目的，不惜破壞瑪麗和楊蔚如婚姻，他更調戲白妻愛密，却給白子達理窺見，當塲拆破了他的虛偽，但白雪剛不但始終沒有明白戴度甫的虛偽，反譴責家人，並把產業承繼權給戴度甫，因此戴度甫在白家更加作威作福用盡狡計需要一手携取白家的權益，直到白雪剛新風他調戲自己的妻子，於是盛怒之下，要把他驅逐出去，但不幸得很，白家一切產業契據全落戴手，他終於惱羞成怒，想把白家全家攆去，最後戴度甫把公安局的科長和巡警帶來了，可是，出於他的意料，當局已明眞相，結果判定戴度甫入獄。</p>
<p>雖這樣簡章，然結構却很嚴緊。而這劇中的人物止如易卜生所說：「每個人物必須是眞的，生動的；每個人物必須是有價値的不是無意義的</p>
<p>飾「偽君子」的周起，是成功的一個，表情的深刻，確是處處都能貼合劇中人，記得好許多日子以前，他在曉風劇團「洪水」及「武則天」裏的演出已得到很多觀眾的擁戴，這一次是給人們更滿意了。飾瑪麗的陳琦與飾楊蔚如的嚴化，當這一對情人，鬧得尬尷的當兒，喜劇的氣氛多末濃厚呢。飾丫環的蔡瑾，伶牙俐齒，把劇中人的身分，完全刻劃出來，飾白夫人張琬的情態，更得人家的好評，其餘的演員，也都很賣力認眞，就是舞台的裝置，也使人滿意。</p>
<p>希望新演劇社，以後的演出，有更大的進步。</p>

<p>今天，忽然又傳來了這樣一個消息，郁藝華經　嚴幼祥，業已啟程赴港，聽郁多少還與王寳釧有關，據一般猜測，除發行事務之外，尚有下列三點：</p>
<p>（一）追踨張翠紅，因張翠紅欲避藝華之邀，已去香港，嚴君此行亦表示並不灰心之意。</p>
<p>（二）聘請廣東紅星李綺年滬。</p>
<p>（三）前上海影人集中港地甚多，冀有以邀一二個來。</p>
<p>上述三點，似乎後二點比較可靠，假使萬一嚴君到香港眞是為了追踨張翠紅，這却是一件很僥興起的事，那末，香港的報紙上定有很發噱的材料了。</p>

<p>余叔岩不願出演的最大原因</p>
<p>鬚生與丑角合演的戲本已少，而「天雷報」「慶項珠」「瓊林宴」等更非有老搭當不能相得益彰。實錄除有時與長林同為叔岩配演「出箱」之差人外，其餘各劇就未曾與叔岩配演過。所以余氏倘擬再作馮婦，第一件要緊事就須先找到一位能守規矩，作戲有準補子的名丑，這樣他才敢長期演唱。要是敎他馬馬虎虎的隨便找幾個配角，我想他為顧惜以往的盛名計，他決不如此草率從事的。</p>
<p>此外還有一個最大的原因，時時阻碍他出演的，就是他的經濟太也充裕了。據說他每月可以拿進兩三千元的利息，他的家庭，人口很簡章，夫妻兩女之外，別無他人。北平生活程度又低，他們無論如何耗費，決不會開支到五六百元的，每月利上加利，家產一年多似一年，自己又沒有兒子，再掙上十萬百萬，終是便宜異姓人家，因此他但是能借故不唱，他就不必自尋苦惱啦。從前淸道人批評大鶴山人的書畫道：山人書畫俱精，然而非窮不賣。可見凡屬藝人，皆不可過於有錢。叔岩年僅五旬有零，正是當年老譚成名的年齡，這時火候才到，但正好以夙年所學貢獻社會，而他却歸隱舊京，不使他的絕技與世人相見，這不但是戲迷們的不幸，同時一輩後進伶人，都無緣看到他的藝術，以為參考借鏡，而有所遵循，這於伶界本身上也損失頗鉅呢。（三五）</p>

<p>坤伶鬚生馬雲樵，歷在外埠演唱，以嗓音圓亮，極受歡迎。月前來平後，一度出演廣德樓，名琴師徐蘭沅目為可造之材，即轉挽遲子俊汲引，拜入鮑古祥門牆，與坤伶鬚生首席孟小冬　成師姊妹，每日除得鮑吉祥指點外，復得小冬之幫助，藝事猛進。近有人為雲樵組班公演，不日即可實現</p>
<p>名凈金少山年前嗓音一度失潤，後經某大夫悉心診治，現已痊愈，然至今尚未登台，其原因據云售盤細布漲經濟問題，故一時不能出演。據另訊謂金不日即將出演國　藝術振興會主辦之佳劇。消息兩歧尚待證實</p>
<p>後起武生張雲溪在東省跌傷腿部，外則傳說傷勢頗重，恐將殘廢云云。唯聞諸雲溪之跟包人言，雲溪此跌，不過引起舊傷，只帶調養而已。又雲溪之下把張小傑，有與李少春合作之醞釀，亦被他人勸阻，仍將與雲溪合作，由此而觀，雲溪痊愈有日也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Consolidation of Jin-Hua Army's River Defenses; Japanese Troops Repelled at Liulin Ferry <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Heavy Fighting Continues as Chinese Troops Pursue and Attack; Japanese Troops Surrounded in Villages Such as Cun in Southern Jin; (Xingji) Japanese troops occupying Liulin Ferry at Jundu have retreated eastward in succession, securing the river defense. This time, the Japanese army attacked from central and western areas via both north and south routes but were repelled. The central route advanced to Jundu but was affected by the Chinese army's scorched-earth policy and ambushes along the way. In addition, the Japanese army was weakened in the central and western areas. A certain unit of the Chinese forces approached Licheng, while another unit controlled Dawu and Zhongyang, providing direct containment. The Japanese army was unable to cope with both ends and could not gain a foothold. When the Chinese army began its counteroffensive on the evening of the ninth, the Japanese army at Jundu was first defeated by the Chinese forces. They were then intercepted and attacked from the flanks along the way, resulting in a dire situation. East of Jundu, areas such as Mucun, Xiecun, and Yangjiaping were further pressured by the Chinese forces. Simultaneously, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Liulin, severing all communication lines of the Japanese army. On the morning of the tenth, they withdrew from Liulin and retreated towards Lishi. After the Chinese army recovered Liulin, they immediately pursued and attacked. Currently, there are no Japanese troops west of Liulin. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) This time, the Japanese army in Zhongyang and Lishi launched a large-scale westward attack but suffered heavy casualties after the Chinese army launched a fierce flank attack on the south side of the highway. After the Japanese army occupied Liulin and Mucun, they were attacked by the Chinese army day and night and were unable to gain a foothold. Since the eighth, they have shown signs of wavering. The Chinese army immediately launched a fierce ambush on the Japanese army on the Lishi-Jun highway. On the evening of the ninth, all routes of the Chinese army attacked simultaneously, resulting in a fierce battle throughout the night and causing numerous Japanese casualties. By dawn on the tenth, the Japanese army in Liulin and Mucun could not withstand the attacks and retreated eastward in full force. Chinese ambush troops intercepted them at the Shueixuanwan hilltop east of Liulin, killing more than two hundred Japanese soldiers. They then dispatched troops to pursue. Liulin and Mucun were immediately recovered by the Chinese army. Subsequently, on the ninth, the remaining Japanese troops at Jundu were cleared, restoring transportation at the ferry. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yuji) According to a certain commander, the Japanese army in western Shanxi, with a force of 20,000 troops, launched a three-pronged attack from Zhongli on the first, attempting to encircle Liulin and seize ferry crossings such as Jundu, Qikou, and Sanjiao to cross the river and invade westward. A certain unit of the Chinese army employed new tactics, launching ambushes, flank attacks, and night attacks everywhere. First, they killed more than a thousand Japanese soldiers near Wanglaoposha Mountain on the Liqi Highway, defeating the right flank of the Japanese army. Then, they engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army for three days and nights at Hutouquzhai, Zewan, and other locations on the left flank, killing five to six hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army's attempt to invade Sanjiao with three forces was also thwarted. The central route of the Japanese army, with more than ten thousand troops, launched a fierce attack on Liulin from multiple routes, including Lijiawan, Jinluozhen, and Xiazhaocun, and supported by more than ten airplanes. A certain division of the Chinese forces, in order to cover the completion of the scorched-earth plan, held their ground near Liulin, resulting in being heavily besieged. After four days and nights of bloody battle, they finally broke through and moved to Waiqian, joining forces with the armies from the north and south of Jin, and launched a fierce counterattack on the Japanese army while they were still unsteady. They also dispatched strong units to cut off the connection between the Japanese army in Li and Liulin, advancing to Jundu. The Japanese army, due to the cutoff of supplies and lack of reinforcements, were extremely panicked. On the morning of the ninth, the Chinese army approached both sides of the Li-Jun highway, leading to fierce fighting. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses, and by the afternoon, Jundu was recaptured. The Japanese troops in Xiecun and Mucun retreated to Liulin, still attempting to hold it. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to besiege them. At the same time, a small unit of the Chinese army captured Shueixuanwan east of Liulin. The Japanese army was surrounded on all sides. On the morning of the tenth, they were defeated by the Chinese forces and retreated eastward. Liulin was recaptured that day, and troops were dispatched to pursue towards Lishi. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, Maojin Ferry and Pinglu in southern Shanxi have been officially recovered after a large-scale counteroffensive by the Chinese army. Japanese casualties are estimated to be over a thousand. According to reports, when the Japanese army attacked Maojin Ferry on the fifth of this month, the Chinese army offered slight resistance before conducting a planned retreat, but then immediately reinforced and counterattacked. After a fierce battle on the night of the sixth, Maojin Ferry and Pinglu were recaptured. According to Chinese observations, the reason why the Japanese army cannot maintain long-term control after occupying a city or territory is due to the fact that most of the newly recruited Japanese soldiers entering Shanxi have not received sufficient training. These new recruits still have considerable strength when operating under artillery fire, but they cannot hold out when engaging in close combat with the Chinese army. As for the Zhongtiao Mountain area, Japanese casualties are estimated to be over two thousand. In western Shanxi, Jundu has been recaptured by the Chinese army, and fierce fighting is currently underway east of Liulin. (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yuanqu) After the Chinese army in southern Shanxi captured the two strongholds of Pinglu and Maojin Ferry, their military prestige greatly increased, and the river defense was further consolidated. The Chinese army then took advantage of the victory to pursue. The majority of the Japanese troops retreated to the north of Zhongtiao Mountain, while a small number retreated to Zhangdian. Currently, there are over two thousand Japanese troops in the area south of Dacun Village, and over three thousand Japanese troops in the areas of Xiniu, Xiani, and south of Zhangdian, who are being besieged by various routes of the Chinese army.

<p>(Zhengzhou) A unit of the Japanese army consisting of over four hundred soldiers and six cannons from Bo'ai harassed Xuliang Town on the morning of the day before yesterday. A certain unit of the Chinese army went to attack them, and a bloody battle ensued near Xuliang. The Chinese army charged bravely, resulting in a fierce battle for three hours. Many Japanese soldiers were wounded or killed. By 10:00 a.m., the Japanese army could not withstand the attack, abandoned over twenty corpses, and retreated towards Bo'ai. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shaanzhou) The Japanese army in northern Henan has suffered heavy casualties in recent days due to fierce attacks by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army ambushed the Japanese army from Penyao to Wankuanshan Village on the seventh, killing seventy to eighty Japanese soldiers. A certain unit attacked the Japanese army in Huojia. On the sixth, they had already approached the outskirts of the city. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted by relying on the city walls. The Chinese army continuously bombarded the city with mortars for days, resulting in extremely heavy Japanese casualties. Currently, the Chinese army is fiercely besieging the city.

<p>(Wuyuan) The Japanese army in western Sui has repeatedly attempted to attack Daqingshan but has been repelled by the Chinese army. The railways and highways in the area have been destroyed by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army is constantly harassed. Feeling threatened, the Japanese army recently redeployed troops to launch a large-scale attack on Daqingshan. The Chinese army fought bravely and repelled the attack, killing over four hundred Japanese soldiers. Six trucks were used to transport the corpses, and over ten trucks were used to transport the wounded, all of which were transported to Taolin and Jining. Currently, the Japanese army is no longer capable of launching another attack and is only holding onto their strongholds. The Chinese are seeking an opportunity to attack. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Wengyuan) On the morning of the eleventh, the Japanese army in Zengcheng and Conghua launched a three-pronged attack on Zengcheng, Fuhe, and Gonghe. One route detoured from Taipingchang Dongwenge, emerging from Liangtian and Taoying. The Chinese army occupied the superior terrain of high mountains and dense forests. The Japanese army, with over a thousand troops, was unable to make progress. The fierce battle lasted until 8:00 p.m., resulting in heavy casualties and a retreat towards Fuhe. Another route of the Japanese army, with several hundred troops, advanced northward from Zhonghe and reinforced with over a thousand troops, attacking Gonghexu from Dajingjun. They engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese ambush troops. The Chinese also dispatched troops to ambush at Dakengyang and Guangku. The battle raged until noon, and this route of the Japanese army was defeated by the Chinese army. One route of the Japanese army, with over a thousand troops, attacked the northwest area of Fuhe from Hemu, northeast of Conghua. The bloody battle lasted until 4:00 p.m., and all three routes of the Japanese army were repelled by the Chinese army. In this battle, over five hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless military supplies were seized. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhaoqing) On the morning of the tenth, over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops from Jiangmen, escorted by three artillery vehicles and supported by four Japanese aircraft, once again harassed the area near Huatangxia. They encountered a unit of the Chinese army, resulting in a battle. By noon, the Japanese army could not withstand the attack. The Chinese army in Jiangmen dispatched troops to pursue and search, recovering many Japanese supplies near Dongzhong. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Wengyuan) On the third, a valiant Chinese air force squadron flew from a certain location to the Xicun area of Guangzhou and bombed the Japanese positions, killing many Japanese soldiers and destroying many Japanese aircraft and military supplies. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese authorities here today notified the U.S. Consulate, stating that from June 14th, the British and French concessions in Tianjin will be blockaded. According to U.S. Consul Caldwell, the Japanese military spokesman stated that residents of the two concessions would not be allowed to leave, but food would still be allowed to enter the concessions. Currently, there are 450 Americans and 700 British residents in the British and French concessions, but there are also 1,000 British troops and their families, and the women and children have begun to relocate. At the same time, Japanese shipping companies have notified customers to quickly remove goods stored in Japanese warehouses in the concessions. There are many rumors here, and the situation is tense. Foreigners outside the concessions are quite uneasy. After the Japanese acknowledged the blockade of the concessions, the British would be greatly inconvenienced. (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese newspapers here, it is reported that the Japanese authorities have decided that from June 14th, all those entering and leaving foreign concessions, except for public officials, will be subject to search, and Japanese residents will be instructed not to go to the British and French concessions unless it is absolutely necessary. It is reported that the search methods will be stricter than last year. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, a mass rally was held by the China Affairs Association, attended by nearly 10,000 people. Several speakers, all well-known figures, criticized the interference of Britain, France, and the United States in Chinese affairs, allowing it for the Gulangyu issue, and interfering in the issues of public concessions and foreign settlements in China. The rally then passed a resolution demanding that the government not only denounce the interference of the three countries, but also quickly conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The resolution has been sent to the ambassadors of Britain, France, and the United States to Japan, Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to diplomatic circles here, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to the extradition of two so-called Chinese terrorists from the British concession in Tianjin to the Japanese, has not only protested to the British Embassy in China, but has also instructed Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, to negotiate with the British Foreign Office in the near future. It is reported that the protest is worded very strongly, aiming to prevent this incident from setting a precedent. According to Chinese officials, the Chinese government has repeatedly requested the concession authorities to protect their Chinese people in the concessions and has earnestly informed the concession authorities that handing over Chinese to the Japanese would be detrimental to the foreigners themselves. The appeasement policy has failed in Europe, so how can one expect it to succeed in the Far East? Furthermore, if Chinese commit crimes, they should be punished under Chinese law. Extradition to the Japanese is completely inconsistent with legal practices. Moreover, this action will effectively recognize the "puppet" government fostered by the Japanese in North China.

<h3 id="e9">Anglo-Soviet Negotiations and the Advance of Aggression <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, Anglo-Soviet negotiations have remained in a state of on-again, off-again. Although Britain and France have drafted another proposal, there has been little actual progress. France has repeatedly expressed its intention to "mediate," and the British government has sent the head of the Central European Department to Moscow to make contact, but the results are still uncertain. Chamberlain's insistence on not making concessions on practical issues and not providing positive guarantees for the security of the Baltic states proves the difference in approach between Britain and the Soviet Union. In Chamberlain's subjective view, he may simply want to use Anglo-Soviet negotiations as a weapon to demonstrate to Germany. His purpose is simply to promote old policies in a new direction. Yesterday's London dispatch in this newspaper said: "According to Chamberlain's plan, even if the Soviet Union accepts the proposals of Britain and France, what will follow will not be specific sanctions against aggression, but rather the beginning of 'adjusting relations' with Germany and Italy. If this 'adjustment' goes smoothly, it will at any time turn in another direction and head towards a four-power pact, retracing Chamberlain's old path." This is not an impossible outcome. We can see this trend from recent British diplomatic expressions: Halifax's speech on the 8th emphasized that "the age of aggression is over," and Chamberlain's speech on the 9th expressed a willingness to discuss Germany's demands through negotiations; is all of this not a clear reflection of Chamberlain's illusions?</p>
<p>Precisely because Chamberlain has not eradicated the illusion of "appeasement," the collective security system cannot be established smoothly, and the crisis of aggression cannot be effectively prevented. Yes, under the active advancement of Germany and Italy, Britain has indeed established a partial security system, providing guarantees to countries such as Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Greece. However, this guarantee is limited to the above-mentioned countries and does not extend to other countries at risk of aggression. This restriction on the guarantee is equivalent to strengthening the rejection of guarantees for security in other directions. The famous British political commentator Dodd put it well: "Chamberlain filled in some mouse holes but refused to fill in others, the purpose being simply to let the mice run to the unfilled holes." He guaranteed Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Poland, but refused to clearly guarantee the three small countries on the Baltic coast; this, interpreted in a bad way, is equivalent to preventing Hitler from attacking southeastern Europe and driving him to scurry towards northeastern Europe.</p>
<p>During the period when Anglo-Soviet negotiations have been slow to progress, the aggression front has taken the opportunity to launch a major counteroffensive. In recent days, we can see their arrogance and activity everywhere, whether in Europe or the Far East. In Europe, German-Polish relations have suddenly become tense again in recent days, and the Danzig issue could erupt at any moment. Although Hitler does not seem likely to use force against Poland at present, he is trying to use the temptation of an "eastward advance" to induce Chamberlain to stage another "Munich." Moreover, Nazi activities in northern and southern Europe and the Baltic Sea are also exceptionally active, and these are precisely the "mouse holes" that Britain and France have not provided military guarantees for. The threats of Germany and Italy against Yugoslavia and the visit of the Yugoslav regent to Berlin indicate that Yugoslavia is being dragged into the embrace of Germany and Italy step by step; Denmark, Latvia, and Estonia have all concluded non-aggression treaties with Germany, which at least indicates a lack of confidence in the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In short, today, German and Italian aggressors are seeing clearly the weaknesses of Britain and France and are making full use of the opportunity of stalled Anglo-Soviet negotiations to intensify their expansion to the north and south, strengthening their political and military position in preparation for a large-scale attack on Britain and France in the future.</p>
<p>Just as in Europe, the situation in the Far East is entirely the same. Although Japan is saying repeatedly that it refuses to join the German-Italian alliance, its diplomatic actions are responding to Germany and Italy everywhere. Today, Japan is seizing Britain as a target and is carrying out a fierce anti-British movement everywhere. The Gulangyu issue remains deadlocked; the Lun Chang cotton mill in Pudong, Shanghai, is being forced to remain closed, and a British staff member, Ding Gl, has been innocently stabbed to death; a British military attaché in Zhangjiakou has actually been detained; on the pretext of extraditing "anti-Japanese elements," Japan has simply blockaded the British concession in Tianjin. All of these anti-British operations in the Far East can be seen as induced by Chamberlain's policy.</p>
<p>In the absence of progress in Anglo-Soviet negotiations and the failure to establish a universal collective security system, the aggressors are naturally launching a counteroffensive. It is clear that if Britain and France do not eradicate the illusion of compromise with the aggressors, if the Soviet Union does not exert its strength and determination to oppose aggression, and if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union do not make more thorough efforts towards collective security, the result will only be to help the aggressors. We believe that the painful lessons of reality in Europe and the Far East are the first step in the piecemeal defeat of the aggressors, and we do not believe that this is not enough to serve as a warning to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union!</p>
<h3 id="e10">Previous Night, Japanese Planes Attacked Chongqing and Chengdu; Bombs Mostly Landed in Residential Areas; American Methodist Hospital and West China Union University Were Affected <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese planes bombed Chongqing this evening, dropping more than 50 bombs, mostly in the western district. The educational school grounds of the American Methodist Church and the residence of the missionary Lan Pu, who has lived in China for more than 30 years, were hit. This Japanese attack on Chongqing entered the city airspace from the west. The bombed area started from the embassy district near the Yangtze River to the north of the Jialing River. When the Japanese planes attacked, 15 Chinese planes took off to intercept them. According to official sources here, it is said that the Chinese planes shot down as many as three Japanese planes. Because the houses in the western district are quite far apart and not very dense, and the air-raid shelters there are sufficient, one bomb hit the entrance of a certain air-raid shelter, killing 20 people and injuring 30. The American Methodist Hospital on the banks of the Yangtze River was almost destroyed, injuring more than 60 people. The air-raid alarm was issued at 5:30 pm. The Japanese planes entered the city airspace at 7:20 pm, and the alarm was lifted at 9 pm. Among the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes, there were many incendiary bombs. Several bombs landed on the opposite bank of the Yangtze River from the Mobil Oil Depot. According to observations from the French Embassy, the range of the Japanese bombing formed a semicircle, starting from the Jialing River in the north and reaching the Yangtze River in the south. Several bombs also hit near the reception room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (American Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) After the Japanese planes bombed this area today, both Chinese officials and foreigners said that the targets of the Japanese bombing were entirely residential and commercial areas, which were more than ten miles away from important military areas or General Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters. According to officers on the American gunboat "Tutuila," the British gunboat "Eagle," and the French gunboat, they personally witnessed 18 Chinese planes taking off to fight the Japanese planes during the bombing of Chongqing. Two Japanese planes were shot down by Chinese planes. However, there were no reports from Chinese or foreign sources here on whether the Chinese planes suffered any losses in this air battle. According to the Chinese side, the Japanese bombing of Chongqing this time was not worth the loss in terms of both material damage and casualties. There are three reasons for this: Most of the population of Chongqing has been evacuated; Many new air-raid shelters have been built; The aiming technology of the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery team is better than before. This point is also acknowledged by foreign military personnel. (American Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Details of Bombing in the Suburbs of the Two Cities</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The number of casualties in Chongqing and Chengdu last night after the bombing by Japanese planes is unknown, but it is widely believed that Chengdu suffered heavy casualties because the geological conditions there do not allow for the construction of basements. Twenty-seven Japanese bombers each attacked Chongqing and Chengdu, totaling 54 planes. At 5:30 pm yesterday afternoon, 54 Japanese bombers were discovered, flying in two groups through Yichang and heading west along the Yangtze River towards Chongqing. Chongqing immediately issued an air-raid alarm, and Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to the east to intercept the Japanese planes. Only a small squadron of 27 bombers appeared over Chongqing at 7:20 pm, encountering intense fire from the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery team. The leading Japanese plane dropped four flares in one or two places, illuminating the western suburbs of Chongqing as if it were daytime. The Japanese bombers then bombed the area with many beautiful residences along the way, with several bombs landing in the Yangtze River, not far from the Mobil Oil Depot. The Japanese planes used several heavy bombs, and when they exploded, it was like an earthquake. Those who took refuge in the basement near the door were knocked to the ground by the force of the explosion. After the leading Japanese plane dropped the flares, several planes flew low to drop bombs. Near 9 pm, the alarm was lifted in Chongqing. Another batch of 27 Japanese bombers had passed Chongqing and flew towards western Chengdu. At 9:10 pm, a long-distance telephone call was received from the mayor of Chengdu, stating that the city had been bombed, but the details were not known. However, the casualties in Chengdu must be heavy. It is reported that the current population of Chengdu, after the evacuation of residents from the occupied areas, has exceeded one million. Basements cannot be built there because water is found only three feet below the surface, and there are no mountains in the city, which is different from the situation in Chongqing. In this attack on Chongqing, the heaviest casualties were in the lumber yard in front of the Yangtze River, with more than 100 casualties. At midnight, a Reuters reporter overlooked the lumber yard from the top of the mountain and saw rescue workers, stretcher teams, and first-aid teams carrying torches back and forth, carrying the dead and injured up the mountain from the riverbank in the darkness. This scene was very rare. This morning, a Reuters reporter went to the riverbank and saw 30 bodies waiting to be buried, with their heads, hands, and feet mostly blown off. When the alarm sounded, many coolies crawled under the woodpile, thinking they would be safe. However, one bomb fell ten feet away from the woodpile, and another bomb hit the woodpile directly, killing 20 coolies under the woodpile. This morning, one body was still not removed from under the woodpile. There were many bombs on the south bank of the Yangtze River opposite Chongqing, near the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River. The American Embassy and many foreign shops are on the south bank. In this Japanese attack on Chongqing, very few incendiary bombs were used. Most of what was dropped were explosive bombs, but three incendiary bombs fell into the Yangtze River, burning on the surface of the water for several seconds. One bomb fell into a sweet potato field on the hillside, creating a huge crater. The sweet potatoes within a radius of 50 feet were all uprooted. Two bombs also hit the main road, killing ten people and destroying a car. Yesterday's Japanese air raid proved the safety of the air-raid shelters built under the cliffs of Chongqing. Several heavy bombs directly hit a well-built air-raid shelter with five exits. The shelter was covered with sand, creating a huge crater ten feet deep, but the rocks were not damaged. Three exits were blocked by the fallen soil, but the people in the shelter escaped from the remaining two exits unscathed. One bomb hit another air-raid shelter directly, blasting a large rock that fell down the hillside, injuring three people standing outside the entrance of the shelter. Another interesting feature of yesterday's bombing was that the impact of bombing the suburbs was far less than bombing the densely populated urban areas. Although Japanese planes dropped more than 100 bombs in various districts of the suburbs of Chongqing, there were fewer casualties and less property loss, except for the elderly in the lumber yard on the riverbank. No fires broke out in any district, and most of the bombs fell on open ground. This morning, a Reuters reporter went to various districts and saw only six houses completely destroyed and twenty damaged. The situation in the bombed western suburbs was the same as before, which was very different from the scene after the recent bombing in the urban area of Chongqing. It is reported that five Japanese bombers were shot down by Chinese planes in the air battle, two crashed in Chongqing and three crashed in Chengdu. According to Chinese sources, the air battle in Chengdu was fierce. Three Japanese planes were shot down in the southeast of Chengdu. Japanese planes dropped many incendiary bombs in Chengdu, and fires broke out in many places, but the fires were all under control by midnight. Three bombs were dropped on the campus of West China University, injuring two foreign professors. Two students of the school were members of the International Emergency Relief Team, one died and one was injured. It was recently learned that Japanese planes also dropped bombs in the consulate area of Chongqing, and a heavy bomb fell behind the British Consulate General, destroying an ancient temple. No casualties were reported. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties at West China Union University</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This afternoon, this area received a telegram and long-distance telephone call from Professors Fei En and Shi Mo Si of Jinling University and Fei Wusheng, the secretary of the National Executive Committee of the YMCA, who is currently in Chengdu, stating that the wife of Professor Shi Telan De, a doctor at West China Union University, was injured by shattered glass during the Japanese bombing of Chengdu yesterday, and a female student was killed on the spot. In addition, 14 people were injured, and seven of them also died from their injuries. A total of six bombs hit the university campus, two of which did not explode. A total of 26 Japanese bombers attacked Chengdu yesterday, dropping incendiary and explosive bombs in the city, causing two fires, which were extinguished at 4 am this morning. There are currently 40 American expatriates and 35 Canadians living at West China Union University. The school is run by American and Canadian churches and is located one and a half miles outside the south gate of Chengdu. Currently, Jinling University, Jinling Women's University, and the Medical College of Zhongda University in Nanjing, and Qilu University in Jinan are all holding classes at the school. Nearly one bomb landed near the houses where the president of Jinling University and his family lived, nearly causing an accident. One bomb also hit near the faculty dormitory of the medical school, and the faculty members were holding a meeting there at the time, so they were almost in danger. The number of casualties in this Japanese bombing of Chengdu has not yet been determined, but it is widely believed to be around 500. American expatriates in Chongqing and Chengdu are extremely angry about the Japanese bombing of West China Union University, saying that the school has no military targets. They sent telegrams to U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull today, detailing the bombing. It is reported that 48 Japanese planes did fly over Yichang this afternoon, but they did not continue to fly to Chongqing, so Chongqing did not sound the alarm. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>American Expatriates Telegraph Hull to Report</p>
<p>(Chongqing) American YMCA executive Fei Xiu, West China Union University professor Li Qiumen, and Chengdu Jinling University professor Shi Mishi today jointly telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, Bide Man and Lai Nuo, asking them to pay attention to the Japanese planes' indiscriminate bombing of Chongqing and Chengdu. The original telegram stated: "The areas bombed by the Japanese planes are completely without military targets. Their intention is clearly to bomb civilians and carry out the aim of killing people and destroying property. However, the reason why this indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes can be implemented is still due to the supply of oil and other materials to Japan by the United States. Therefore, we cannot but ask you to pay attention to this so that we can get rid of this inhuman responsibility for slaughter as soon as possible." (American Associated Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Five Hundred Civilians Killed and Wounded in Chengdu</p>
<p>(Chengdu) The Japanese planes bombed here yesterday, dropping bombs from north to south, towards densely populated areas. The bombs dropped by the Japanese planes in Chengdu included both explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. Fires broke out in several places in the city center and the south of the city, but they were all extinguished in time. A bomb also hit the dormitory of a school run by the Baptist Church. The home of Dr. Chen, the president of Jinling University, and his family were severely damaged when their residence collapsed. In addition, the "Fuyuan" registered under the French flag was also sunk by a bomb. West China University was also hit by six bombs, but two of them did not explode. At the same time, because the bombs fell in the square, only one female student was killed and 15 male students were injured. It is reported that more than 500 civilians were killed and injured in this Japanese bombing, and they have all been transported to the university hospital for treatment.

<p>(London) Stirling, Head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office, was ordered to go to Moscow as a representative of the Foreign Office. He flew to Warsaw this morning at 10 o'clock and then to Moscow. It is reported that he carried special instructions regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet anti-aggression pact. Before Stirling's departure, a meeting was held this morning at the Foreign Office and the residence at Downing Street. Mr. Stirling went to the Foreign Office early in the morning to have final discussions with Foreign Secretary Halifax and the British Ambassador to France, Phelips, who was in London at the time. Shortly after, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky also met with the Foreign Secretary and then went with Phelips to meet with Chamberlain at Downing Street. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) British foreign policy has recently been commented on by various newspapers here, all of which say that there is no fundamental change in the current policy. In other words, Britain will continue to resolutely resist all forms of aggression and attempts to dominate Europe. In addition, a certain Italian newspaper believes that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech in the House of Commons on the 8th of this month was an attempt by the British government to restore its appeasement policy, which has recently been denied by major British newspapers. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax were very busy meeting with various dignitaries today. In the morning, they held talks with Stirling, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, for more than an hour. The Foreign Secretary then met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and immediately informed the Ambassador of the new draft of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement passed by the Cabinet. (According to the draft, the text has been handed over to Director Stirling to take to Moscow.) Afterwards, he met with Sir Phelps, the British Ambassador to France. In addition, Colonial Secretary MacDonald will go to Geneva tomorrow to attend the Standing Mandates Commission of the League of Nations to discuss the Palestinian issue. He was interviewed by Prime Minister Chamberlain today. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon, "Mr. Stirling, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, flew to Moscow today. Regarding the progress of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, everything is as I reported on the 7th of this month, and there is nothing more to add." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords is scheduled to discuss foreign policy tomorrow afternoon, at which time Foreign Secretary Halifax will deliver a speech to supplement his previous statement on the 8th of this month. Political figures expect the meaning of the speech to be very important, so they are all eager to know its contents. Prime Minister Chamberlain, who spent his weekend vacation in Birmingham yesterday, has returned here. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Dalton, a Labour Member of Parliament from the opposition, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "The failure of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement has caused anxiety among the people of the country, and they all believe that the government intends to delay the matter in order to restore the policy of the Munich Agreement. Does the Prime Minister know this?" Prime Minister Chamberlain suddenly stood up and replied, "Mr. Dalton's statement is extremely baseless. I do not know any reason why the government should be blamed for the length of the current negotiations." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Henderson, a Labour Member of Parliament from the opposition, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "According to the government, what are the main conditions for convening a world conference to resolve various outstanding international issues?" The Prime Minister replied immediately, "For such a conference to be successful, all participating countries must have a heart of mutual trust and be willing to obtain a fair solution to various outstanding issues, and be willing to abide by the accepted constraints and the promises made in spirit and letter. The British government is determined to do its best to promote this spirit of trust, but other governments must also make the same efforts to be effective." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>The Simon Faction Seeks to Win Over Italy and Germany</p>
<p>(London) The European situation has recently been commented on by certain Conservative figures, who all said that Britain's military strength is sufficient and that it has also achieved an extremely superior position in diplomacy, so it can rest easy. Therefore, it is time to convene an international conference to discuss the issue of "economically vital space," as Foreign Secretary Halifax advocated on the 8th of this month. However, in order for Germany to agree to participate in the conference, it is necessary for Italy to come forward and mediate. If this can be done, Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will jointly discuss the matter with Sir Loraine, the British Ambassador to Italy (who just left for his home country yesterday). Those close to Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon even believe that it would be easier to reopen negotiations with the Axis powers if Britain does not conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. When a European conference is convened to discuss the issue of firmly establishing peace in the future, the Soviet Union should also be excluded from the conference. Although this view is not endorsed by the British Cabinet, if Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov fails to show a spirit of compromise in future negotiations with Britain, the views held by Chancellor Simon's faction may gradually gain the upper hand. From this, it can be seen how British foreign policy will evolve, which can be seen within this week. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Canberra: Australian Federal Prime Minister Menzies stated here today that he welcomed British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks that if Germany is prepared to engage in negotiations in a peaceful spirit, then Britain is prepared to respond accordingly. He believes that if it is desired to restore a more peaceful era in which commerce and finance are all stable, then the method of a round table conference must be adopted. The distorted relations between the major powers and the sense of injustice felt by some countries cannot be adjusted or eliminated by force. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Questions British Good Faith</p>
<p>(Rome)</p>
<p>The newspapers here have expressed their approval of the speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and British Foreign Secretary Halifax last week, but said that Britain's good faith remains to be proven. Gatta, Mussolini's mouthpiece, wrote an article published in the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," which stated that the British Prime Minister's new remarks made us feel doubtful. Listening to his words makes us feel that there is hope for the future, but the facts and developments seem to run counter to the spirit of his words. The Agency News reported that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ciano believes that we believe in the complete sincerity and goodwill of Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Halifax, but if they really want to establish a round table conference, then they should say "I am prepared to discuss" and not repeat the words. It is reported that Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Halifax both declared last week that if there is a real and reasonable hope of a solution, then Britain is still prepared to discuss the demands of Germany or any other country at a round table conference.

<p>Hyde Park – Last night, President Roosevelt's mother hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the King and Queen. The King presented President Roosevelt with a gold inkstand engraved with the royal crest. After days of strenuous socializing in Washington and New York, the King and Queen were finally able to take a much-needed rest here towards the end of the week. After attending a prayer service at church yesterday, the King and Queen had a picnic with President Roosevelt and others around noon on the verdant hillside surrounding the President's private residence. They sat casually around eight tables, enjoying wild game and cold food, drinking beer, and laughing without formality. After the meal, they listened to American Indians playing music until 4 PM. Then, President Roosevelt drove the royal couple to his wife's villa for refreshments. Hyde Park, usually very quiet, became a center of public gathering this week because of the King and Queen's visit. Knowing that the King and Queen would attend a prayer service at St. James's Church, people began gathering outside the church on Saturday night. By 3 AM on Sunday, the crowd was enormous. President Roosevelt and his wife, along with the King and Queen, went to the church, where Bishop Tuke delivered a sermon. His position is equivalent to that of the Archbishop of Canterbury in England. In his sermon, he stated that the countries participating in this service occupy a position of greater than ordinary influence in world affairs. Therefore, they bear a major responsibility for saving the world from the threats to its happiness. (June 12, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hyde Park – King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England arrived here last night and stayed at President Roosevelt's private residence. This morning, the President's entire family, four generations, accompanied them to St. James's Church to attend Sunday prayer. From early morning, residents emptied their homes and gathered under the hundred-year-old trees outside the church to see the royal couple. At precisely 11 AM, the King and President arrived in the same car, casually dressed, chatting and laughing along the way. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King was also in attendance. The Queen, the President's mother, and the President's wife rode in the second car. The President's son and daughter-in-law, and granddaughter were in the last car. After getting out of the cars one after another, they entered the church. The crowd outside the church cheered enthusiastically. Only about 200 people were invited to attend the prayer service inside the church. The King and Queen sat side-by-side with the President and his wife in the first row. The prayer service began shortly thereafter. The ceremony was quite simple, no different from usual. Only Bishop Tuke touched on the issues of "class selfishness" and "religious exclusion" in his sermon, saying that the difficulties faced by various countries could be resolved with the help of Britain. Reverend Wilson, stationed at the church, spoke next, without mentioning politics. He only said that he was pleased that one of the church's parishioners had come with their distinguished guests, causing the people near the church to be almost completely crowded. The prayer service ended at noon. The King and Queen and the President's entire family returned to the private residence, changed into casual clothes, and drove to a forest three miles away for a picnic. The King and Queen, the President and his wife, and the President's daughter-in-law rode in the same car, driven by the President himself at a very high speed, forcing the King to hold on tightly to his hat against the wind. Later, they stopped in front of a small wooden cabin in the forest, where the guests sat on the porch and enjoyed the surrounding scenery. About 150 guests were invited, including Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and his wife, New York Governor Lehman and his wife, and other dignitaries, as well as ordinary citizens. The guests personally gathered firewood to cook sausages, bread, and other foods. After the meal, two red Indian girls sang to entertain. Finally, the President introduced the guests to the King and Queen. On the return trip, the President again drove himself. After returning to the private residence, a small tea party was held before everyone departed in high spirits. In the evening, the President and his wife hosted a farewell banquet, with 20 people invited to accompany them. The King and Queen bid farewell to the President at 10 PM and boarded a special express train to return to Canada. (June 12, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) Czech Envoy to France Osusky recently told a "hardline newspaper" interviewer, "The Czech people have been subjected to unwarranted foreign invasion and are no longer an independent nation, but have become part of Germany's 'vital space.' German Leader Hitler solemnly declared on March 16 of this year, the day after the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia, that he would respect the independence of the Czech people. At that time, there were no atrocities committed by the German authorities in those provinces, and the Czech civil servants were able to stay in their positions, and the people were not mistreated. But as time passed, these promises were broken. Recently, many Czech employees in public and private institutions have been dismissed and replaced by Germans. The people's property and food have been requisitioned, and goods have been confiscated, including iron railings, livestock, wood, and enamelware. Cloth is scarce, and prices are soaring. Meat is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Families of modest means have become destitute. What is most intolerable is that the Czech people's basic freedoms have been deprived, and patriotic movements have been banned. German cabinet member Frank publicly declared yesterday that the Czech people have no right to enjoy independence and that their only duty is to work hard and promote the welfare of Greater Germany." But in any case, the Czech people will never submit to this kind of oppression." (June 12, Havas dispatch)</p>

In the evening, the Leader went to the Burgtheater to listen to a play. The original program was a historical play depicting the German Emperor Henry IV of the Middle Ages humbling himself and going to Canossa to seek forgiveness from the Pope. The theater authorities temporarily replaced it with a comedy. (June 11, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The third defense line, ordered by Hitler last October to strengthen the defenses between Aix-la-Chapelle and Saarbrucken, has now been completed. It is reported that the new defense line is built to the west of the road connecting the two cities, while the earlier two defense lines are to the east of the road. According to news from German newspapers, the new defense line is heavily armed. At the same time, special strong fortresses have been added to the defense line from Saarbrucken to Basel. Germany's most famous defense line is the Siegfried Line, facing the French Maginot Line, which was completed last year with the labor of hundreds of thousands of workers.

<p>(Berlin) Germany is actively expanding its armaments and has recently built fortifications on its eastern and western borders, employing a large number of workers. As a result, there is a severe shortage of workers in various industries. The government is considering re-employing Jews who have been forced to give up their jobs in order to supplement the workforce. These Jews include many lawyers, doctors, merchants, and cultural figures. They are currently demolishing old houses in certain areas in accordance with the Berlin beautification plan. One of the workers, a former lawyer, said that this kind of work is not of a controlling nature. In particular, Jews who are willing to be employed are easily hired. Some intellectuals felt tired in the early stages of work, but after a while, they became accustomed to it. Supervisors at various construction sites all recognize Jews as good workers. Our wages average one mark and ten fennigs per hour, with an average of eight hours of work per day. There is occasional overtime, which is also paid by the hour. Workers with wives and children receive additional allowances. In short, although our situation is not considered good, it is better to work hard than to be idle all day or suffer other misfortunes. This is commensurate with our former status, so it does not matter. (June 11, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Dr. Todt, the Director-General of German Highways, said in a speech at a National Socialist Party meeting yesterday that the news published in foreign newspapers and released by the Strasbourg wireless relay station that the "Western Wall" of the Western Border Defense Project had been submerged due to flooding was not accurate. Although the German "Western Wall" suffered from flooding, all camouflage projects and underground trenches remained intact. Moreover, the project is not only exceptionally solid, but also cannot be detected by spies within France. Therefore, in the event of war, this newest type of German defense project will never be conquered by the enemy. (June 12, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian stated in today's editorial, "Why does Japan want to openly provoke Britain? If one can investigate a good reason for it, then we will have to say that Japan now clearly intends to start a conflict. Britain is indeed aiding China, but not as much as the United States, and even less than Germany. Does Japan have a special reason to choose Britain alone to vent its anger? Or is it because Britain is convenient to take the blame for Japan's failures? Is Japan rewarding Germany for refusing to join the Axis by carrying out its actions to stimulate Britain in the Far East? Or has Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy hinted to Japanese authorities that they can truly threaten to drive Britain out of China? Call a halt! This is the time! If Japan's policy continues, we must make it responsible and warn it of the consequences. Britain should urgently consult with the US and French governments at this time, because their interests are also in the same predicament. It would be a great mistake to obey Japan's aggression in the Far East in exchange for its promise of neutrality in European disputes, because promises can be broken and Japan is not in Europe."

<h3 id="e35">Yunnan-Burma · Yunnan-Sichuan Two Railway Constructions in Progress Central Government has dispatched commissioners to Yunnan to preside over them Yunnanese advocate for the southern route for the Yunnan-Burma Railway <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Kunming Dispatch: For the construction of the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Sichuan railways, the central government had already selected and dispatched commissioners to Yunnan last year to establish offices and actively carry out the work. Recently, in order to accelerate construction and accommodate transportation workers discharged from the front lines, the central government intends to reorganize the Yunnan-Sichuan and Yunnan-Burma Railway Bureaus. It has also been decided to appoint an additional Director-General for the Yunnan-Burma Railway. It is proposed to appoint Zeng Yangfu as the Director of the Yunnan-Burma Engineering Bureau, and Sa Fujun will be transferred to the Xukun Engineering Bureau Director.</p>
<p>Regarding the preparations for the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, according to a report by Yang Wenqing, co-organizer of the Yunnan-Burma Highway Administration, the proposal to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway was initiated thirty years ago, but it could not be realized due to manpower and financial constraints. After the September 18th Incident, the international situation became increasingly dangerous. The government, recognizing the importance of the Yunnan-Burma Railway for rear area transportation, had to prepare early. Therefore, it specially dispatched commissioners to investigate. After several considerations, it was believed that connecting to Nandai near Gunlongjiang, which is generally referred to as the southern route, would result in a shorter route and easier construction, allowing for completion and opening to traffic in the shortest possible time to meet urgent needs. Therefore, it was decided to adopt this route. Later, due to financial difficulties, it was temporarily shelved. Although the highway is now open, the war is becoming increasingly tense. To strengthen rear area transportation and enhance the power of resistance against Japan, the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway is still imperative. The Ministry of Communications established the Yunnan-Burma Railway Bureau last year to oversee the project, dividing it into sections and aiming to complete it within two years. The route goes from Kunming along the highway to Zhennan, deviating northeastward, passing through Yao'an to Qinghuadong in Xiangyun. From Qinghuadong, it passes through Midu, Menghua, Shunning, Yunxian, Mianran, Zhenkang, to Nandai on the Yunnan-Burma border, divided into two sections, with a total length of over 480 kilometers. The engineering work is not very difficult. If there are no difficulties with funding and materials, there should be no major problems in opening to traffic within the set timeframe. However, while actively proceeding, people from Tengchong in this province and members of the National Political Council have proposed building the northern route, that is, from Xiangyun via Yangbi, Shuiping, Baoshan, Tengchong, to Myitkyina. The reasons given are all well-founded. However, after careful examination of the facts, the northern route is indeed inferior to the southern route, because the southern route is shorter, the construction is easier, and it can be completed in the shortest possible time to meet wartime needs. This reason is more than sufficient compared to any other reason. Because of the time constraints, the selection of the route should prioritize the ability to save time. In addition, the southern route is located in the southwest or center of the province. Extending it northward can control Tengyong, and extending it southward can control Sijin, making it the best route politically and internationally. Moreover, the places along the southern route, such as Midu, Nanjian, Gonglang, and Yunxian, Zhenkang, etc., have fertile land and a hot climate. All industrial plants such as cotton, tea, sugarcane, camphor, and tung oil can be produced in large quantities, and gold, silver, copper, and iron are said to be widely available, with considerable value for economic development. Therefore, no matter from which perspective, the southern route is indeed superior to the northern route. It is hoped that the transportation authorities will make a decisive decision, eliminate dissenting opinions, and continue to actively proceed with the southern route without hesitation, so as not to hinder the project. However, it is true that the southern route passes through areas with a smaller population and a hotter climate, resulting in a shorter working time. Ways should be found to remedy this. During this rainy season, preparations should be made early for the recruitment of workers, the transportation of rice and grain, and the provision of hygiene and medicine. From September to October, manpower should be concentrated and construction should begin actively. By March of next spring, the entire subgrade is expected to be completed. Continuing to build bridges and culverts should not delay the project. However, the construction methods should be thoroughly corrected, taking into account the actual situation and emphasizing local customs. For all contracting work, not only should contractors not be required to pay security deposits, but they must first be given some recruitment fees to facilitate the promotion of the project.</p>

<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Han River originates from the borders of Fujian and Jiangxi, gathers the waters east of the Five Ridges, and flows into the sea through Chaoan and Chenghai. From Xiangzi Bridge in Chaoan city to Sanheba in Dapu County is the main stream. Below the South Gate of Chaoan, it splits into four tributaries. Only one small river passes through Fengxi and enters Fengkou in Jieyang County. The Han River's tributaries pass through fertile plains, forming rice paddies and wetlands. The river flows slowly, and silt accumulates, raising the riverbed almost to the level of the land. Each village must raise the dikes every year. Every autumn and summer, mountain torrents erupt in the mountains of Fujian and Jiangxi, and Chaozhou often suffers from dike collapses. Crop losses are often in the millions. If there is no flood, it is a bumper year. Because there are sluices in the dikes, water can be released into the fields for irrigation. Small streams and ditches, like spider webs hanging in the fields, can be used for small boats. Small boats can also be used to transport agricultural products, eliminating the need for oxen carts. There is a dike-protecting highway built from Chaoan to Shantou. At present, the war is pressing, and the Chao-Shan Railway has already been dismantled. The dike-protecting road must be thoroughly destroyed. However, once the dike is broken, there will be floods, and millions of people and millions of acres of fertile land will inevitably be turned into lakes and swamps. The authorities have spent a lot of effort on this issue, asking water conservancy experts to study it for half a year, making sure to minimize harm and maximize benefits, reducing the damage to the people as much as possible. Now, the research has entered the implementation phase, which is to dig three new canals to replace land transportation. Currently, those going from Shantou to Chaoan must first take an electric boat to Anbu, or directly to Chaoan city. The first new canal has already begun to be realized. The sluice of the Longweiye Taizi Dike in Anbu has been opened, and the river water is flowing in torrents. Originally, it was excavated to a depth of two zhang, but now, with the water flowing into the channel, the power of the water can make the canal wider and deeper. When the dike is cut off, the water will naturally flow into the Chupu of Pengzhou, without washing away all the civilian houses and villages. The second new canal is in Jishuitayinhu, and the third new canal is at the Chuncheng Zong Station outside the South Gate of Chaoan. When the dike is cut for the second time, the river water will pass through 700 mu of Huzhou mandarin orange orchards. The third time, it will have to pass through Fengxi.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 4th, the number of Japanese warships outside Mayu Port in Shantou increased to eight, including cruisers of over 10,000 tons. On the 5th, three more transport ships loaded with Japanese soldiers anchored off the coast of Nanao. More than ten armed electric boats repeatedly sailed close to the North and South Ports of Mayu Port, attempting to probe the situation and secretly land. Also, merchants who had not evacuated from Shantou City left the city in droves on the evening of the 4th, taking boats. At present, Shantou City is like an isolated island, with only one escape route left, with a floating bridge, reserved as a last resort in an emergency. At around 8:00 AM on the 5th, Shantou City issued a piercing air raid alarm. Japanese planes flew into Shantou City from overseas four times, scouting the suburbs for more than an hour and dropping five bombs. At noon, eight more Japanese planes flew over the upper reaches of the Han River, dropping eight bombs on Xingning Nanwai, destroying one Diaolou house, killing three people, and injuring more than ten. Four bombs were also dropped on Meixian City, one of which landed in the Li Family Ancestral Hall in the city. The location and extent of the other losses have not yet been determined.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal United Branch of North Fujian Road Issues Substitute Vouchers The Rumor That Quarter Tickets Can Be Used for Half Value Is Not True</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is extremely inconvenienced by the lack of subsidiary coins. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly find a remedy. The original text reads: To the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, it has been a long time since the old copper coins and one-cent subsidiary coins suddenly disappeared in Shanghai. Finding change is made through postage stamps instead, which is extremely inconvenient and causes disturbance from time to time. Please quickly find a remedy, so as to facilitate the circulation, the sooner the better. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Koutou, Wen,</p>
<p>City United Branch Issues Substitute Vouchers</p>
<p>The 37th Branch of the Shanghai Municipal United Association of North Fujian Road approved the suggestion of Member Fukang Sauce Garden, saying that copper coins are lacking and it is impossible to find change, some are replaced by postage stamps, and some are printed with substitute vouchers, the situation is very chaotic, postage stamps are substitutes for national postage, and in this copper shortage, they are most appropriate to replace, but the purchase of postage stamps is also difficult at present, and it is inevitable that they will be dirty after a long period of use, and it is difficult to use them to replace postage, regarding the small number of substitute vouchers printed by themselves, giving change to customers, can only be limited to the issuing store, our number thinks that please your association to print a few one, two, three, four, and five-cent substitute vouchers, each store needs a certain number, bring money to the meeting to buy a certain number, this substitute voucher is generally available in all stores on this road, once the government stipulates a remedy, or the copper coins are replenished, you can transfer the silver vouchers issued by your association to your association for legal tender, is it not inappropriate, I hope that the public will make a decision, the association approved the proposal, yesterday night, it invited various shops on the road to discuss, it was decided that for the convenience of citizens and the sake of the whole business, two kinds of one-cent and two-cent temporary substitute vouchers will be printed temporarily, each kind with 10,000 sheets, the voucher has a stub, and is stamped with a hard seal, to be more solemn, the validity period is until the end of September this year, anyone holding the voucher for ten cents, can exchange it for one dime of legal tender,</p>
<p>Sauce Garden Guild Writes to Inquire About Two Points</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Sauce Garden Industry Association, saying that the copper coins in the market are becoming less and less, the oil and soy sauce of our industry, people need it every day, mostly coolies, three, five, seven are sporadic, it is difficult to find, it is reported that the government bank corner tickets, can be temporarily divided into two, for five cents of use, and then according to the government recently printed corner tickets, to relieve the city's public decree, is our case, please make it clear, so that the letter to the industry, etc., when the Chamber of Commerce replied in a letter saying, check the first statement is unfounded, the second statement has not yet been received by the Ministry of Finance, the current matter, the Chamber of Commerce is sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to quickly find a remedy,</p>
<p>Avoid Finding Change Affects Livelihoods</p>
<p>The lack of copper coins in Shanghai has reached an unprecedented phenomenon, and all industries feel a great impact, in order to avoid finding change, the prices of various items have been adjusted, although some have cancelled the odd prices of goods, such as one dime, one or two cents, changed to one dime, etc., but most of them take the opportunity to add the odd numbers to the whole number, such as one dime, five or six cents, then added to two dimes, implementing their disguised price increase, this kind of profiteering means of market clerks is really shameful, and the burden of civilians is increased invisibly, so the lack of copper coins affects the livelihood of the civilians, to a great extent,</p>
<p>Issuing Corner Vouchers Hope Is Very Much</p>
<p>Since the lack of copper coins in Shanghai, it has been rumored that the government authorities will issue three kinds of corner vouchers, one cent, two cents, and five cents, to replace the copper coins circulating in the market, all sectors are sympathetic to the issuance of the vouchers, if Hong Kong continues to transport a large number of copper-nickel coins to Shanghai, the journey may not be robbed, but after being transported to Shanghai, they will also be absorbed and exhausted, if the corner vouchers are issued, it can prevent the copper coins from being repeatedly taken, and all industries can rely on this circulation, so the issuance of corner vouchers is beneficial and harmless, and recently the nickel coins in the market are also gradually lacking, but also by the profiteers bought and resold,</p>
<p>Buying Stamps Is Very Crowded</p>
<p>All industries, in order to facilitate finding change, will use postage stamps to replace copper coins, this phenomenon, has been common throughout the city, therefore, the need for postage stamps has increased sharply, in peacetime, each tobacco store, there are postage stamp retailers, but their prices are arbitrarily increased, such as five-cent stamps actually need seventeen copper coins, so at present, each store and individual, are directly to the post office to buy, in recent days, all post offices stamps, are all crowded, competing to buy,</p>
<p>The Biggest Reason for the Lack of Copper Coins</p>
<p>The reasons for the lack of copper coins in Shanghai are very complicated, but the profiteers act as accomplices, searching for profits, resulting in the interruption of the source of copper and nickel coins, which is the biggest reason, (1) a certain party raises the price to entice profiteers to buy, such as the old generation of copper coins, about two and a half pounds of market weight, can be sold for one yuan of legal tender, profiteers pair the capital and profit, and compete to collect, auxiliary sale to a certain party, (2) the new copper and nickel coins in Shanghai, after being transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai for supply, the transportation work, mostly entrusted to foreign ships for transportation, but recently a certain party repeatedly inspected foreign exports, there have been copper and nickel auxiliary vouchers transported to Shanghai that were confiscated, and the source was interrupted,</p>

<p>Chinese copper coins are of excellent quality, before the currency, before the implementation of new subsidiary coins in various places, the copper coins circulating in various places and the large copper coins of Hubei and other provinces, also known as double copper coins, the amount of circulation in the market is quite large, after the implementation of the new currency system, although some of them were taken back by the Central Mint and reminted into one-cent copper subsidiary coins, some of them were used by a certain party to collect and transport them back as raw materials for military fire by various means, in the past one or two years, the trend of collection has become more intense, the amount of private exports is also more enormous, it is estimated that the copper coins smuggled each year, at least at 50 million yuan or more,</p>

<p>The puppet banknotes could not be promoted, so he was anxious and sick, and his old illness relapsed, so he could not afford it.</p>
<p>Chen Jintao, the puppet "Vichy Government Finance Minister" and current president of the "Huaxing Bank," has recently been staying in Shanghai for a long time due to his age and long illness, and to facilitate the handling of the bank's affairs. After the opening of "Huaxing," all the puppet banknotes, that is, in the occupied areas, were rejected by the people, and Chen was originally the puppet Finance Minister, and then the puppet government reassigned Yan Jiachi to replace the department, so he was not without regret, which triggered his old illness. Yesterday, it was learned that Chen died of his old illness in his private residence on Baole'an Road at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Chen was 68 years old this year, a native of Guangdong, and the "Huaxing" Bank may suffer a further blow due to Chen's death.</p>

<p>London's Viewpoint Reuters London, December 12th: London Financial News stated that, according to the phenomenon, the new price of Chinese legal tender should be above six pence. If this price can be supported for a certain period of time, the Chinese Stabilization Fund Committee may adopt this level as the formal new exchange rate and stabilize it. However, it would be unwise to think of this as the final equalization price. When the Stabilization Fund was established in March, the authorities were confident that they could maintain the exchange rate of eight pence and twenty-five, but in less than three months, the authorities had to reconsider. Therefore, the natural level, when the Sino-Japanese War drags on, must change.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Situation</p>
<p>After the Chinese government implemented the adjustment of exchange rates, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and other banks in Shanghai have restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, and for legitimate needs, they are still supplying and selling according to the listed price, so import firms can still obtain a considerable amount of foreign exchange as usual, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank accepts applications as usual, and approves foreign exchange, still supply according to the Central Bank's hanging price of one shilling, two pence, and two five, yesterday the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Chase, Favorex and other banks, supplied with British exchange of six pence and half, US exchange of twelve yuan, six eight seven five, the Hong Kong side also telegraphed Shanghai to supply and sell, so the foreign exchange situation is still stable, public investigation is gradually rising, the exchange discount rate is still around five yuan, but the cash rise is still dramatic, yesterday it created a new record of two thousand five hundred and sixty-two yuan, the silver building jewelry gold listing, then rose to two hundred and fifty-six yuan,</p>

<p>According to the shipping industry news, at 9:00 AM on the 10th, seven more Japanese planes raided Zhenhai, dropping 14 bombs, and the ancestral tomb of Fu Xiaoan, the puppet "Mayor" of Shanghai, in Qingzhi, was also bombed. Also, the war spoils of a Japanese plane shot down by the garrison on the 7th have been transported to Yong. The Zhejiang Provincial Government allocated 25,000 yuan to build temporary residences in various counties that have been bombed. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Attack Tomb of Fu is Bombed</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, at 9:20 AM on the 10th, the sky was gloomy and it was drizzling. The air defense monitoring team of Yin County reported that seven Japanese planes flew from Longshan in the northeast and entered the territory of Zhenhai County. They issued an air raid and emergency alert. The Japanese planes first circled over Zhenhai City several times, then dropped three bombs on Xiaogang, and then dropped 11 bombs on the port, destroying more than 60 civilian houses, killing two women, and injuring one woman. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes retreated along the original route. Two Japanese planes were also seen passing over the eastern countryside of Yin. The air raid alert was lifted in Yongbu at 9:50 AM. The ancestral tomb of Fu Xiaoan, the puppet mayor of Shanghai, in Qingzhi, was also hit by a bomb, destroying it completely. The coffin boards were shattered and the corpses were scattered. At 1:30 PM, the second team of the Yongbu monitoring team again issued an air raid alert, which was in the direction of Xiangshan, and gunshots were heard. However, since they did not enter the territory, it was lifted after a while.</p>
<p>Japanese Plane Shot Down War Spoils Obtained</p>
<p>Also, on the afternoon of the 7th, five Japanese planes invaded Zhenhai and dropped bombs wildly. After heroic shooting by the air defense forces of the fortress, one Japanese plane was shot down and fell into the Youshan Sea outside Zhenhaikou. A Japanese pilot was injured and killed when he fell while deploying his parachute. It is now learned that the war spoils found in this battle include a parachute, a pistol, a flying cap, and a pair of leather boots, which were escorted to the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters by the garrison on the 11th. It has been determined that the Japanese plane that was destroyed and fell into the sea was an Italian-made Type 89 biplane single-engine reconnaissance aircraft, worth more than 30,000 yuan. The corpse of the aviator has been buried in the Zhenhai Charity Cemetery.</p>
<p>Temporary Residences Built in Various Counties</p>
<p>The Provincial Relief Association previously decided to request the Provincial Government to allocate funds to build temporary residences for residents in various counties that have been heavily bombed. The Provincial Government approved the allocation of 25,000 yuan first and formulated a plan to distribute the funds separately. Yong gets 1,000 yuan, and Zhen gets 2,000 yuan. The method is based on thatched huts, located ten kilometers outside the city, and completed within one month. After the construction is completed, it will be opened first. It would be even better if the local area could raise funds to add to the construction.</p>
<p>Anti-Occupation Leaflets Found on Daishan Island</p>
<p>Daishan Island, which belongs to Dinghai County, has been searched by the Japanese army in all directions since they landed and occupied it on the 22nd of last month, threatening merchants and civilians to use military tickets and counterfeit subsidiary coins, and the people are extremely angry. Also, large numbers of Japanese anti-war leaflets have been found in the streets and alleys of Dongshajiao for days, and it is heard that there are recently five Japanese warships, one transport ship, and one armed fishing ship, a total of seven ships, docked in Daishan. The Japanese troops who landed, including more than 300 marines, are stationed in Dongshajiao, Gaoting North Peak Mountain and other places, all under the command of Japanese Commander Yu He Yinzuo.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Japanese Newspaper Openly Expresses Anti-British Sentiment; Even Suggests a Similar Incident to the Dingkeler Case Might Occur <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The *Chinese-Language Press* reports: The Japanese newspaper *Continental New Report* published an editorial yesterday (the 11th), titled "The Unavoidability of the Anti-British Movement," which stated, in brief: If Britain wishes to protect its interests in China, we must warn it not to do so through methods that "benefit the Chinese government," but to seek other ways. The current anti-British atmosphere across Japan is the resentment of the Japanese people and an expression of opposition to British policies towards Japan. If Britain continues to maintain its</p>
<p>current policy,</p>
<p>it has no right to protest against anti-British sentiment. We know that the Japanese people have strong anti-British feelings, and we do not wish to deny or conceal them. However, is it not Britain itself that is causing this anti-British sentiment? Japan is now making a desperate gamble with its own future, engaging in a life-or-death struggle in China. Britain is providing spiritual and material assistance to the anti-Japanese government, so it is inevitable that Japan cannot have</p>
<p>friendly sentiments</p>
<p>towards Britain. We frankly express the feelings of the general Japanese public: Japan is fighting not only against the Chinese government but also against the Chinese government plus Britain. Britain may protest against Japanese incitement and protection of anti-British movements by Chinese people. We do not know if any Japanese people are participating in such movements, but even if they are, it is not surprising. The Dingkeler incident, in which British and Japanese consuls-general exchanged protests, was</p>
<p>serious,</p>
<p>but it was merely an unfortunate event arising from the deteriorating relationship between Britain and Japan. If British-Japanese relations in China are so bad, and such unfortunate incidents occur, as in the Dingkeler case, it is possible that similar incidents will be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>Eggs Continue to Arrive; Egg Product Exports Sharply Decrease</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang provincial authorities permitted the export of eggs, egg factories in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign-owned, have dispatched personnel to eastern Zhejiang to purchase them. For several days, ships sailing from Wenzhou and Ningbo to Shanghai have been arriving with large quantities of eggs. All egg factories have resumed operations. According to egg merchants, China's egg production for export and foreign sales has traditionally been concentrated in Shanghai, occupying an important position in foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the war, egg exports from Shanghai have decreased sharply, accounting for only 20-30% of pre-war levels.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Shanghai Citizens Need Not Worry About Food; Rice Reserves Sufficient for Three Months; Eleventh Survey Shows 560,000 Bags in Storage; Supply Still Smooth; Grain Merchants Buying, Rice Prices Rise Slightly <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the high cost of goods, large rice merchants have been bullish on prices, and grain merchants have been buying in large quantities, causing the highest price to rise to 18 yuan. The Bean and Rice Trade Association announced yesterday that the eleventh survey of rice reserves in various warehouses totaled more than 567,000 bags, a decrease of more than 10,000 bags compared to the previous survey. However, the city's rice reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of the citizens for more than three months, and new rice will also be available at that time, so the citizens of Shanghai need not worry about food shortages. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grain Merchants Buying, Rice Market Still Stable</p>
<p>The price of rice had already stabilized, but recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, prices of all goods have risen. As a result, large rice merchants have been uniformly bullish on prices and have refused to sell the more than 300,000 bags of rice they own. At the same time, grain merchants took the opportunity to buy in large quantities in the market, causing the highest Changshu rice price to return to 18 yuan per bag on the 11th. Yesterday, due to active buying by grain merchants, the price rose again by five cents, to 18 yuan and five cents. However, because the holders of the goods were quite firm in their intentions, less than 100 bags were sold. Other goods from Jiangyin, Kunshan, Suzhou, and Tongli were priced from 17 yuan and one dime to 17 yuan and eight dimes, with supply and demand meeting, so the rice market situation was still stable.</p>
<p>Smooth Supply Channels; Arrivals Still Flowing</p>
<p>The source of national rice is that various rice industry groups have been buying and transporting large quantities of rice from the producing areas to Shanghai. After unblocking the supply channels, arrivals from various places have been quite smooth. Recently, rumors suddenly spread that rice boats were being detained and that the source was interrupted. According to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, although incidents of rice boats being obstructed on the way are unavoidable, the source has not been interrupted. Currently, an average of at least 5,000 bags arrive per month. For example, yesterday, rice arriving by river and land reached more than 5,000 bags, so the source of rice is still smooth.</p>
<p>Reserves Can Last Three Months</p>
<p>The quantity of rice stored in Shanghai's warehouses was reported yesterday by the Bean and Rice Trade Association's eleventh survey as a total of 567,588 bags, a decrease of 11,371 bags compared to the tenth survey. However, the tenth survey had increased by 16,767 bags compared to the seventh survey, so this decrease is not at all worrying. According to a person in the rice industry interviewed by the Xin Xin News Agency, the current 567,588 bags of rice in various warehouses, plus the 50,000 to 60,000 bags stored in the city's rice shops, are enough to meet the needs of Shanghai's citizens for three months. Moreover, arrivals have not been interrupted, and new rice can be put on the market in three months, so the citizens of Shanghai need not worry about food shortages.</p>
<p>Ordered Foreign Rice Already Returned</p>
<p>Twenty-four rice shops in Shanghai jointly entrusted the French company Dufay to order 2,000 tons of foreign rice, originally scheduled to be delivered to Shanghai in the middle of this month. However, according to a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, the shipment of foreign rice has been terminated. When the rice shops ordered the foreign rice, they stipulated that the price of each bag upon arrival in Shanghai would be 19 yuan and four dimes in national currency, regardless of exchange rate fluctuations. Unexpectedly, the exchange rate has recently tightened. If the settlement is made according to the current exchange rate, the foreign company will suffer a significant loss, so it is willing to compensate the ordering parties for some loss fees and cancel the order. The rice shops also believe that if the foreign rice is transported to Shanghai and sold, it will inevitably lose money at the current market price. On the other hand, they can obtain more than 20,000 yuan in so-called loss fees. Thus, under the mutual interests of both parties, the foreign rice has been declared canceled. Merchants' goals are originally to profit, so how can we criticize them?</p>

<h3 id="e50">U.S. Far East Fleet Scheduled to Sail to North China; Four Submarines and Nine Destroyers in Total; Sail to Yantai and Weihai in Batches to Escape the Heat <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Navy's Far East Fleet stationed in the Philippines, including destroyers (torpedo boats) and submarines, goes to Yantai, Weihaiwei, and the waters of North China every summer to escape the heat and conduct training. It returns to its base in the fall. When the fleet passes through Hong Kong and Shanghai, it must enter the port and delay for a few days for sightseeing.</p>
<p>Departed from the Philippines in Mid-Month</p>
<p>The summer heat escape period for this year has arrived, and the ships, led by the command ship, departed from the Philippines in mid-month. Some ships did not enter port when they passed Wusong and sailed directly to Yantai, so fewer ships came to Shanghai this year. Four submarines, Nos. 36, 38, 40, and 41, led by a submarine tender, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of last month and entered the port to moor at the floating buoys in the Yangshupu River. After delaying for a week, they sailed to North China at the beginning of this month, led by the tender.</p>
<p>Flagship *Black Hawk* Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition, four destroyers, *Beelmer* No. 222, *Parrott* No. 218, *Edsall* No. 219, and *Stewart* No. 224, arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. Four more destroyers, *Alden* No. 121, *John D. Edwards* No. 216, *Whipple* No. 217, and *Barker* No. 213, arrived on the 6th of this month. All were moored in the Yangshupu River. The flagship *Black Hawk* also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 11th) and was moored at the U.S. Navy floating buoys in the Yangjingbang River. The ships are now leaving Shanghai and heading to North China.</p>
<p>Returning to the Philippines in Mid-August</p>
<p>It is reported that the four destroyers that arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month will leave Shanghai on the 16th, led by the flagship *Black Hawk*. The four destroyers that arrived on the 6th of this month will leave Shanghai on the 19th, led by lead ship No. 227, and will return to the Philippines in mid-August. They may come to Shanghai again at that time.</p>
<p>Wusong Guerrilla Force Attacks Yanghang at Night</p>
<p>Japanese Barracks Burned; Wusong-Shanghai Traffic Interrupted</p>
<p>On the night of the 10th, a guerrilla force of 400-500 men from Wusong attacked the Japanese barracks in Yanghang Town. They launched the attack at 11:00 PM. Before the attack, they destroyed the traffic around the Japanese barracks, digging a wide and deep ditch at the Wangjiabang Bridge on the Songyang Highway to block the support of the Japanese army in Wusong and Baoshan. Then, they tightly surrounded the barracks and sent several daredevils to sneak in and set fire. In an instant, the fire blazed, and the Japanese army responded in a panic but could not break out. For a time, the fire illuminated the sky, and gunshots echoed. Jiangwan and Baoshan could be seen clearly. The two sides fought fiercely until about 3:00 AM on the 11th, when the guerrilla force safely withdrew. It is estimated that the Japanese army suffered more than 30 casualties, and two-thirds of the barracks were burned down. Three military trucks, 50-60 warhorses, grain, and other losses were very heavy. By dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese army had mobilized troops from Baoshan and Jiangwan to provide support and are now conducting large-scale searches in the Yanghang and Wusong areas. Traffic between Wusong and Shanghai has been interrupted, and nearby residents have fled.</p>
<p>Passing Through Jiading</p>
<p>According to someone from Jiading yesterday, a large guerrilla force, estimated to be 3,000 to 4,000 men, passed through Jiading the day before yesterday morning. Several flags of Blue Sky White Sun were flying in the sky. They were fully armed and, according to reports, passed through Jiading from North Chuansha and went to a certain place, according to transportation sector sources.</p>
<p>Tension in the Suburbs of Hangzhou</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th, the Chinese guerrilla force that roams the territory of Haining County suddenly attacked the Longwangmiao Station, killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers. Another unit continuously attacked Babu, Yuanhua, Changan, and Xucun, and destroyed the tracks of the Changan-Hangzhou Railway. Traffic on the road has been completely blocked since the 8th. The atmosphere in Hangzhou is tense, and most of the shops set up by Japanese merchants have moved to Jiaxing. On the Jinghang National Highway, the Chinese army fiercely fought the Japanese army to seize the Shangbu stronghold north of Wukang on the 7th, causing more than 100 Japanese casualties. On the same day, the Chinese artillery destroyed a Japanese cannon at the Sanqiaobu in Wukang.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Pseudo "Provisional Government" Plans to Seize U.S. Soldiers' Gold Dollars; Plans to Implement an Ordinance in Yantai; One U.S. Dollar Worth Three Yuan in Pseudo Currency <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The *Continental News* reports: American Asian Fleet sailors going to Yantai this summer may find it difficult to exchange their U.S. dollars at full value. Yesterday (the 11th), it was learned from reliable sources here that the Japanese and the "Provisional Government" authorities plan to implement an ordinance in Yantai to prevent sailors from exchanging U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of other ports in China. Notices have been issued to various pubs, hotels, exchange shops, etc., to exchange sailors' U.S. dollars for "Federal Reserve" currency according to the current Japanese yen exchange rate. This means that U.S. sailors will not be able to exchange one U.S. dollar for seven yuan at the current exchange rate, but will instead get three yuan and six dimes in "Federal Reserve" currency. If this ordinance is successfully implemented, sailors will suffer considerable losses upon landing. Since the value of the legal currency has recently fallen, merchants in Yantai who import beer and other beverages from Shanghai have had to raise prices. According to the owner of a Yantai pub who is currently purchasing goods in Shanghai, buying a bottle of Shanghai beer in Yantai this summer will cost one ocean yuan.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that most of the items listed in the table of goods designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs as prohibited from being transported to the enemy were native products of the province. If they were banned, not only would the rural economy be hit, but local finances would also be indirectly affected. It submitted three points to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting</p>
<p>flexible handling.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has now received a reply from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the prohibition of transporting goods to the enemy is to prohibit transportation to the designated prohibited areas, and not a general prohibition of exports. The various prohibited items in Zhejiang Province, if they are for export or re-export to ports such as Hong Kong and Shantou that have not been designated as prohibited, should be released.</p>
<p>To transport to Shanghai,</p>
<p>the Chamber of Commerce in the city and the Chamber of Commerce or Public Association at the place of departure must issue a certificate, which must be approved by the county or city government at the place of departure before being submitted to the customs for inspection and release. This method has been telegraphed for compliance. With the approval of the telegram, all items other than food, salt, metal materials, coal, gasoline, and alcohol listed in the prohibited list,</p>
<p>are allowed to be inspected and released.</p>
<p>Although the procedures for certification are not entirely consistent with the review methods for transporting to Shanghai, they can be temporarily handled in response to the times and to evacuate stockpiles. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Finance to telegraph the customs for compliance, a special telegram is sent for reference.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Yancheng</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Is Devastated; Western Personnel Cooperate in Relief</p>
<p>The Northern Jiangsu International Relief Committee office in Shanghai is cooperating with Western personnel from the American Advisory Committee to coordinate spring relief efforts in Northern Jiangsu. A total of more than 330,000 yuan has been allocated to Yancheng, Pixian, and other counties. Relief directors have been dispatched to work with local charities and church personnel to investigate households and distribute funds. The committee has now received a detailed report on the disaster situation from Qiu Xiang, the Yancheng Relief Director. The report states: Xiang and others arrived in Yancheng on the evening of the 19th. The area is devastated, and recovery has not yet begun. Refugees have taken refuge in various villages. In the urban area, only a corner of the West Gate outside the ferry terminal has stalls and trade. The tragic situation is unique to Northern Jiangsu. After consulting with Chinese and Western personnel, it was decided that Xiang and others would first conduct surveys in the first, second, third, fourth, thirteenth, and fourteenth most affected areas. Pastor Qiao will lead personnel to investigate households in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh severely flooded areas. The first district has summoned refugees back to the city to receive relief.</p>

<p>President Chiang's telegram orders the country to control waste, nurture national strength, and strive for final victory. The original order states: Modern warfare is a final showdown of the sum of a country's manpower, material resources, and financial resources. The one whose economic and material resources can provide sustained supplies will win the final victory. However, our country's production is backward, and most of what is needed for the war of resistance depends on foreign countries. Recently, all the coastal ports have been blockaded, and military supply has become even more difficult. To thoroughly implement the goals of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, it is essential that the entire country, from top to bottom, shares concerns and dangers, encourages each other, practices thrift, and nurtures national strength. It is necessary to make one thing do the work of two, one person do the work of two, one penny do the work of two, and one day do the work of two, in order to break through the difficult road ahead and complete the great cause of saving the country. Also, think of the compatriots who have been displaced by the war and the hard-working masses in dire straits. They are still generously donating their life's blood with fervent patriotism, which is truly worthy of gratitude. If our soldiers forget their responsibilities, disregard dangers, continue bad habits, and are extravagant and wasteful, how can they face the public and how can they console the soldiers who died in the war of resistance and the patriotic people? It is specially and earnestly warned that they must deeply reflect, cherish public property, control waste, value personality, and cultivate integrity. They should strive to achieve the maximum effect with the minimum resources and win the final victory in the shortest time, returning our rivers and mountains and ushering in a great era of prosperity. Great hope is placed on this.</p>

<p>The war has now entered a new stage. Military, political, diplomatic, and economic affairs are all being improved from the past bloody lessons, and new measures are being taken with full confidence in victory. However, there is still a key to the victory or defeat of our war of resistance that is ignored by the general public, namely that wounded soldiers have not been able to receive complete care and relief, which is the greatest regret since the beginning of the war. The victory of the war depends not only on the bravery of the soldiers at the front and the perfect equipment of the health institutions, but also on the ability of the vast masses in the rear to provide spiritual and material comfort at any time and place, so that wounded soldiers can recover as soon as possible and return to the front lines. The former German general Ludendorff obtained unexpected battle results by obtaining the highest number of returning soldiers and thanked the rear personnel three times, which should inspire us to reflect deeply. China is vast, the war zone is vast, and the lack of manpower, financial resources, and material resources means that rear services, such as the rescue and transportation, reception and medical treatment of wounded and sick soldiers, have not been able to be carefully planned, so they cannot be compared with Germany, which had full preparations during the European War. However, "spirit ultimately triumphs over matter, and unity is strength." With a nation with 5,000 years of history and a population of 450 million, united in their belief that "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength," assisting the government and caring for the wounded and sick will surely achieve the effect of making up for shortcomings.</p>
<p>Remember the Heroic Spirit of the Past Few Months</p>
<p>Thinking of the past few months, the heroic soldiers at the front, fighting for the survival of our nation, drinking bullets and eating blood, have suffered pain that the people in the rear cannot imagine. The dead are exposed in the fields, and the wounded are covered in blood and flesh. Whenever the main general calls out, the wounded all rise up and are still able to muster their remaining courage to fight the enemy for every inch of land. Their heroic spirit can move gods and shake the earth. When they are seriously wounded and cannot stand up, they are withdrawn from the battlefield, bandaged, and carried to the rear for medical treatment. The government has indeed done its utmost to provide care. However, the more intense the war, the more wounded soldiers there are, and the more difficult the work of care becomes. Although our people are also participating in the care work, it is not a whole and unified action. The effect is so small that some wounded and sick officers and soldiers are abandoned on the road and end up in ditches, and some are crying from hunger and cold and groaning in the streets. This is certainly not a universal phenomenon. However, the fact that there is even one wounded soldier suffering such pain means that our government and people have failed to fulfill their duty of care and should consider it a great shame.</p>
<p>Rescue, Care, and Everyone Is of One Heart</p>
<p>It must be known that the government has made the determination to fight a long-term war of resistance. If the Japanese invaders do not repent and withdraw from the territory of the Republic of China, they will not care about fighting for ten or a hundred years. Therefore, the morale of the soldiers and the continuous replenishment of materials depend on the support of our people at the front and in the rear. If the wounded and sick are not rescued and are treated like strangers, it will not only discourage the soldiers at the front from resisting the war, but also chill the courage of the young men in the rear to join the army. The impact on the future of the war of resistance cannot be overstated. Therefore, rescuing the wounded and sick and caring for the meritorious is said to be the key to the victory or defeat of the war of resistance. We and others, in view of this, initiated the organization of the "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers Association." We hope that our social groups, schools, and institutions will join together. We especially rely on our intellectuals and social leaders to promote it widely. Each will do what they can. Some will go to the front line for transportation, some will raise funds in the rear, some will visit hospitals for comfort, and some will conduct propaganda to the public. Everyone will be of one heart and go all out to ensure that the army and the people are united and the rear and the front are connected. In this second stage of the war of resistance, we will never allow a wounded person to not be rescued or a meritorious person to not be cared for. In this way, final victory can be expected. Sincerely yours.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "China Press Evening Edition," Mrs.伐遜 (Fáxùn), a German Jewish woman of about twenty-eight years old, was very beautiful. She came to Shanghai with her husband on May 18th to seek refuge. She resided in apartment number two above the 拔佳 (Bá Jiā) shoe store at 915 Avenue Joffre, while her husband was staying in a refugee camp in the 滙山 (Huìshān) district. This morning (the 12th) around 8 a.m., an unidentified German Jewish refugee went to Mrs. 伐遜's room and violently slashed her throat with a razor. The cut was deep. He then placed a basin under her head to collect the blood. Afterwards, he cut his own wrists with the razor in an attempt to commit suicide, collapsing to the ground from blood loss. At 9 a.m., other residents of the building heard the man groaning, but did not pay much attention. Around 10 a.m., the landlord of the building arrived, listened, and notified the police station. Police officers forced their way inside and found the woman dead. They immediately sent the man to the hospital for treatment. The motive for the crime has not yet been discovered. The French Concession Police Department is currently trying to determine the identity of the assailant, who is about forty-five years old. It is generally believed that he came from the refugee camp in the 滙山 district. The deceased's husband still resides in the refugee camp, and the police are also trying to ascertain his whereabouts, but as of dusk, the police had not yet found a way to locate him.</p>
<p>(Another report) 伐森華脫 (Fá Sēn Huátuō) (transliteration), a Russian Jewish man, is thirty-five years old this year. His wife, 伐森茵什 (Fá Sēn Yīnshí) (transliteration), also a Russian Jew, is twenty-eight years old this year. They used to conduct business in Germany.</p>
<p>The couple came to Shanghai to seek refuge, arriving on March 27th of this year. 伐森華脫 found employment with a telephone company and lived at number 26, Lane 50,华德路 (Huá Dé Lù), in Hongkou. His wife, 伐森茵什, continued to reside in room number two on the second floor of an apartment building established by Russians at 915 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. 伐森茵什 had a German Jewish lover named 爱纳莱亚 (Ài Nà Lái Yà) (transliteration), who is forty-four years old this year. He also fled to Shanghai and lived at number 40, Lane 225, 公平路 (Gōngpíng Lù), in Hongkou. The two of them</p>
<p>frequently met.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:30 a.m., 爱纳莱亚 went to 伐森茵什's apartment. The attendants of the building did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, after the two met, they began to quarrel, and then 爱纳莱亚 suddenly produced a sharp dagger and committed the crime, first slitting 伐森茵什's throat, then cutting both of his wrists, and finally stabbing himself in the chest. He collapsed to the ground, injured. The apartment attendant heard something fall to the ground in the room and went in to check. He saw 伐森茵什 lying on the bed with her throat cut. A basin was placed under her shoulder, seemingly to collect the blood. She had already</p>
<p>breathed her last.</p>
<p>The man, 爱纳莱亚, was lying on the floor, blood gushing from his wrists and the center of his chest. He was on the verge of death. The landlord of the apartment called the French police station, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They immediately called for an ambulance and sent the injured man to the 廣慈 (Guǎng Cí) Hospital for treatment. They also transported the body of the deceased woman to the Western coroner's office attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on 台拉斯脫路 (Táilāsītuō Lù), awaiting an examination by personnel sent by the Special District Court, as reported in today's newspaper. It is said that the man's murder-suicide was caused by a change of heart in love, stemming from jealousy. The police are currently investigating.</p>

<p>Three Dead, One Critical</p>
<p>張國人 (Zhāng Guórén), a local Shanghainese, and his shared wife, 張氏 (Zhāng Shì) (thirty years old), lived together at number 4, Lane 483, 愚園路 (Yúyuán Lù), in western Shanghai. 張國人 used to work in education. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he went to the interior to work in education. 張氏 lived alone in Shanghai. She contracted an illness after childbirth that did not heal after a long time, and she suddenly had the thought of ending her life. Yesterday morning around 8 a.m., she secretly swallowed a large amount of Lysol. Later, she was discovered by her family and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on 海格路 (Hǎigé Lù) for treatment. However, due to severe poisoning, she passed away before reaching the hospital, and her body was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<p>徐紀昌 (Xú Jìchāng), a local Shanghainese (seventeen years old), was an apprentice at a rice shop at number 954 極司非而路 (Jísīfēiér Lù) in western Shanghai. A few days ago, a person came to the shop and asked 徐 for the repayment of ten yuan owed. The apprentice took out ten 法幣 (fǎbì) from his pocket and returned it. Afterwards, the shop owner suspected the source of the 法幣 and questioned him. 徐 did not answer. Yesterday morning at 7:30 a.m., 徐 suddenly swallowed poison and attempted suicide. After being discovered, he was rushed to the hospital for treatment. He was severely poisoned and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>呂根花 (Lǚ Gēnhuā), a woman from Jiangsu (twenty-five years old), for some unknown reason, suddenly had the thought of death last night around 9 p.m. She swallowed a large amount of toxic Lysol at home and immediately hired a car to go to the 先施 (Xiānshī) Company's 先施樂園 (Xiānshī Lèyuán). When the car arrived there, she paid the fare and took the elevator to the amusement park. After walking only a few steps, she fainted and fell to the ground, her face pale, foaming at the mouth, and groaning miserably. After someone reported to the Chinese police, they rushed her to the 仁濟 (Rénjì) Hospital for treatment. Due to severe poisoning, the medical treatment was ineffective, and she died at 10 p.m. Her body was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination. A suicide note was found, and the sealed note was taken to the police station.</p>
<p>朱有來 (Zhū Yǒulái), an old man from 阜寗 (Fùníng), eighty-one years old, lived in a bungalow on 大通路 (Dàtōng Lù) on 新閘路 (Xīnzhá Lù). Because the lease on the house had expired, there was a matter of vacating the premises. Because 朱 was unable to find a house for a while, he suddenly had the thought of death. Yesterday morning around 5 a.m., he hanged himself at home. After being taken to the hospital by the police car, it was impossible to save him, and he was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<p>Youths Meet Privately in a Room</p>
<p>Reported to the Police Station and Arrested Together; White Powder Seized Awaiting Chemical Analysis</p>
<p>盛志凱 (Shèng Zhìkǎi), the son of 盛蓮舟 (Shèng Liánzhōu), a local Shanghainese living on 憶定盤路 (Yìdìngpán Lù) in western Shanghai, has just come of age. Since last winter, he has been in love with 盛妙珍 (Shèng Miàozhēn), the eighteen-year-old daughter of his neighbor 盛秋聲 (Shèng Qiūshēng). They often went out privately, behind their parents' backs, using inns as places for secret meetings. The early signs of spring had not yet been revealed. As time went on, they became inseparable, attracting the attention of bystanders. The day before yesterday, this pair of young lovers went to the 新新 (Xīnxīn) Hotel on 南京路 (Nánjīng Lù) and booked room 522 for immoral acts. The matter was learned by the girl's parents, 秋聲 and 盛氏, who urgently reported to the 老閘 (Lǎozhá) police station. Detective 郁有文 (Yù Yǒuwén) and Officer 高永安 (Gāo Yǒngān), together with a Western detective, rushed to the scene, arrested the two lovebirds, and seized a package of white powder in the room. They were taken back into custody together and escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation yesterday. Because the police still need to perform chemical analysis on the white powder, Police Lawyer 汝葆彝 (Rǔ Bǎoyí) requested that the case be adjourned. After Judge 馮 (Féng) briefly questioned the defendant, he ordered 盛志凱 to be held in custody pending a seven-day adjournment for further questioning.</p>
<p>Female Hostess Spoke Carelessly; Assaulted and Injured</p>
<p>Two Tourists Detained for Interrogation</p>
<p>朱文秀 (Zhū Wénxiù), a female hostess at the 大新 (Dàxīn) Amusement Park on 南京路 (Nánjīng Lù), was on duty in the park at 7:30 p.m. the night before. She solicited two tourists, 徐之金 (Xú Zhījīn) and 羅根榮 (Luó Gēnróng), both local Shanghainese, to buy tea. 徐 and 羅 did not like to drink tea and refused. The female hostess inevitably made sarcastic remarks in her words, leading to an argument. 徐 and others then used their fists and feet against her, and Miss 朱 was assaulted and injured. The Chinese police officer 郭升甫 (Guō Shēngfǔ), who was on duty at the scene, took both parties to the 老閘 (Lǎozhá) police station for questioning. After questioning, in addition to ordering detectives to send the injured person to the hospital for treatment, 徐 and 羅 were taken into custody and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday. Police Lawyer 汝葆彝 stated that the plaintiff's injuries were serious and that she was still bedridden, requesting an adjournment for further investigation. The two defendants hired lawyers 范剛 (Fàn Gāng) and 俞恩良 (Yú Ēnliáng) to appear in court to defend the cause. Judge 馮 then briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to remain in custody pending a seven-day adjournment until the plaintiff recovered from her injuries and could be questioned again.</p>
<p>Messengers Impersonate Donors; Each Offender Sentenced</p>
<p>朱俊傑 (Zhū Jùnjié), 蔣樹生 (Jiǎng Shùshēng), 胡阿海 (Hú Āhǎi), etc., messengers from the former Charging Telegraph Bureau of Anhui, recently distributed leaflets in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Telecommunications Economy Association, soliciting donations from all walks of life for their own use. Yesterday, someone reported this to the police station, which dispatched Chinese and Japanese detectives to arrest 朱 and the other two, along with the leaflets, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer 錢恂九 (Qián Xúnjiǔ) prosecuted them for fraud. The defendants confessed without denial. Judge 孟 (Mèng) sentenced 朱俊傑 to four months' imprisonment and 胡 and 蔣 each to three months' imprisonment.</p>

<p>徐幹臣 (Xú Gànchén), a Ningbo native, lives at number 164, Lane 400, 武定路 (Wǔdìng Lù), and works as a teacher at the Religious Moral Society. His daughter, 徐林玉 (Xú Línyù), is twenty-nine years old and works in a pharmacy on 中央路 (Zhōngyāng Lù). At night, she attends English classes at the 吉生 (Jíshēng) School on 成都路 (Chéngdū Lù). A young man named 周永富 (Zhōu Yǒngfù), a middle school graduate, is the same age as 徐林玉. Due to the difficult times, he had difficulty finding employment, so he joined the British Naval Hospital on 中央路 as a servant. His home is also located at number 6, Lane 31, 武定路, and because his workplace and residence are not far from 徐林玉, they see each other day and night, becoming familiar and falling in love. Two months ago, they went together to the Aiwen Hotel on 爱文義路 (Àiwén Yì Lù) and had physical relations. From then on, their meetings became more frequent and intimate. The matter was discovered by the girl's father, 徐幹臣, who severely reprimanded 徐林玉. As a result, on the tenth of this month, 徐林玉 left home in anger and met 周永富 on 新閘路. They went together to room 205 of the 新閘 (Xīnzhá) Hotel to stay. On the eleventh, 徐林玉's whereabouts were discovered by her father, who brought her back and reported the matter to the 新閘 police station. Detective 王岐山 (Wáng Qíshān) arrested 周 at number 280 派克路 (Pàikè Lù). Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court. Police Lawyer 厲志山 (Lì Zhìshān) presented the case, but 徐幹臣 and 徐林玉 did not arrive. 徐林芸 (Xú Línyún), 徐林玉's sister, arrived and requested an adjournment. When questioned, 周永富 denied abduction and admitted to having a relationship. After the presiding judge verified the testimony, the court acquitted 周永富.</p>

<p>盛彭年 (Shèng Péngnián) (forty-seven years old) and 盛鳳英 (Shèng Fèngyīng) (forty-two years old), currently residing at number 5, 美麗園 (Měilì Yuán), 大西路 (Dàxī Lù) in western Shanghai, both Shanghainese, hired lawyers 袁仰安 (Yuán Yǎng'ān) and 蘇景祺 (Sū Jǐngqí) to represent them in a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against 黃佩蘭 (Huáng Pèilán) (i.e., Miss 黃三), residing at number 47, 馬斯南路 (Mǎsīnán Lù) in the French Concession, for fraud and obtaining property, requesting a legal investigation and bringing a civil suit as an adjunct. According to the statement, the second plaintiff, in March of this year, was entrusted by a friend, 趙侶靑 (Zhào Lǚqīng), to find a house on his behalf. Then, another friend, 周超技 (Zhōu Chāojì), informed him that the defendant</p>
<p>had a house for transfer.</p>
<p>The second plaintiff immediately informed 趙侶靑, who said that he was also entrusted by the principal of 女子中學 (Nǚzǐ Zhōngxué) [Girls' High School], 王紫珠 (Wáng Zǐzhū), to find a house to expand the school buildings. The second plaintiff then, on March 26th, accompanied 王紫珠, the director of studies 王佩貞 (Wáng Pèizhēn), and 趙侶靑 to the defendant's home to see the house. According to the defendant, the monthly rent for the house was 450 yuan, and the transfer fee was 950 yuan. After 王紫珠 looked at the house and was satisfied, she agreed on a date to pay a deposit. When the time came, the first plaintiff also accompanied 王紫珠, 王佩貞, and 趙侶靑 to 周超技's place.</p>
<p>王紫珠</p>
<p>paid the second plaintiff 400 法幣, which was transferred to 周, who brought it to the defendant's home and handed it over, and agreed to pay the balance of the transfer fee the next day and complete the transfer procedures. On the second day, March 28th, the second plaintiff arrived at 周超技's home at 2 p.m. 王紫珠 and 王佩貞 also arrived. 王紫珠 paid another 550 yuan for the balance of the transfer fee, and another 1,000 yuan in national currency as a reward for the introducer, which the second plaintiff handed over to 周超技. 周 then sent 550 yuan to the defendant to pay it off. The defendant returned to 周's house with 周 and stated in person that</p>
<p>the transfer fee had been paid in full.</p>
<p>王紫珠 then directly paid the defendant three months' rent, totaling 1,350 yuan. After the defendant handed over all the electric lights and tap water deposits to 王紫珠, the defendant accompanied 王佩貞 and the second plaintiff in the defendant's car to the 義品 (Yìpǐn) Bank to process the transfer procedures. Unexpectedly, the defendant regretted transferring the house halfway through because the house was to be used as a school, and returned to 周's house, forming a stalemate. Later, 王紫珠 offered to take over the house in her personal name, but was also rejected by the defendant, who only returned the three months' rent that had been received and refused to return the 950 yuan in transfer fees that had been received and refused to issue a receipt. After several</p>
<p>negotiations failed,</p>
<p>the first plaintiff had no choice but to issue a receipt on behalf of the payment recipient, 王紫珠. Later, the plaintiffs negotiated with the defendant again and reported to the 盧家灣 (Lújiāwān) police station, but the defendant consistently ignored them. It is clear that the defendant used the transfer of the house as bait, leading people to their doom, and defrauding them of property. They requested that the court investigate the matter according to Article 339 of the Criminal Code and order the return of the 950 yuan in transfer fees. According to the complaint, Judge 蔣澄泉 (Jiǎng Chéngquán) opened a court hearing yesterday morning, but the defendant did not appear. Only the plaintiffs and their lawyers arrived. After a brief hearing in court, the judge ordered that the defendant be summoned again on an adjourned date. If the defendant continues to resist the summons, an arrest warrant will be issued.</p>
<p>Girl Drowns in Straw Boat</p>
<p>At around 8 a.m. yesterday morning, west of the 新閘 (Xīnzhá) Bridge on the 蘇州河 (Sūzhōu Hé) [Suzhou Creek], there was a straw boat on which three or four children were playing. Unexpectedly, a seven-year-old girl slipped and fell into the river. At that time, the tide was rising. Four or five men who were familiar with the water jumped into the water to rescue her, but failed to save her.</p>

<p>朱銓 (Zhū Quán), the nephew of 朱鴻達 (Zhū Hóngdá), a famous former lawyer from Hangzhou, is approaching thirty, has received higher education, and used to work for the Customs Service in Shijiazhuang, Yuezhou, and other places. In 1937, 朱銓 pursued 陳守倫 (Chén Shǒulún) (currently twenty-eight years old), a top student at the 培成 (Péichéng) Girls' School from Linhai, Zhejiang, and they eventually entered into an engagement. They held their wedding ceremony at the 新新 (Xīnxīn) Restaurant in Shanghai on May 2 of the same year. After the marriage, 陳 followed 朱銓 to his post. 陳 also once</p>
<p>worked for the Customs Service.</p>
<p>Later, because of the Customs Service regulations, husband and wife could not work for the Customs Service at the same time, so 陳 resigned. The relationship between husband and wife has always been harmonious. Unexpectedly, 朱 recently contracted a mental illness, so he came to Shanghai for medical treatment. At this time, a sudden rift appeared in the relationship between the two, and 朱's family refused to allow 陳 to live with 朱銓, let alone visit her husband. Although 陳 entrusted a lawyer to repeatedly request to live together and visit her husband, she was</p>
<p>sternly refused. 陳 had no choice but to file a divorce suit against 朱銓 in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, and at the same time requested the payment of 5,000 yuan in living expenses, citing abuse and malicious abandonment as the reasons. The case was heard in the Third Civil Court yesterday morning by Judge 桂裕 (Guì Yù). The defendant, 朱銓, did not appear. His mother entrusted a lawyer to appear in court, stating that 朱 was currently being treated for mental illness at the Hongqiao Sanitarium on Avenue Joffre and could not appear in court to respond to the lawsuit, and claiming that the cause of the defendant's</p>
<p>mental illness</p>
<p>was actually due to the plaintiff. 陳守倫 then testified that she had been pursued by the defendant repeatedly when she was studying at 培成, and that was how they became engaged. However, after the defendant fell ill, the defendant's family arbitrarily abandoned her, refusing cohabitation and not allowing her to see her husband. Although she had made repeated requests, she had been rejected by the defendant's father and the defendant himself in letters. Although she is currently temporarily employed at the Jianghai Customs Service, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan, after deducting the room fee of 19 yuan, her other expenses for clothing, food, and transportation are already</p>
<p>very tight.</p>
<p>Therefore, she is unable to pay the litigation fees and requests that she be granted litigation aid. As for the requested living expenses, she originally needed 20,000 yuan, but now she is temporarily suing for 5,000 yuan. The basis for her request for this item of living expenses is what the defendant admitted himself in a letter to her after abusing her. Moreover, the defendant's mental illness has been cured and he has reported to the Customs Service, and it has also been</p>
<p>certified by the Customs doctor.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason for his absence today is actually an excuse. As for the fact that she is currently working at the Customs Service, it is only temporary, because once the defendant starts working, she will have to resign according to the rules. She also presented several letters to and from the defendant and his father as proof. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant's illness had not yet fully recovered and could be ordered by the doctor to be examined. As for refusing the plaintiff's visit, it was</p>
<p>the doctor's suggestion</p>
<p>for fear that the defendant would be stimulated again and his illness would worsen. After reviewing the testimony, Judge 桂 (Guì) stated that both parties belonged to prominent families and both indicated that there was still a possibility of continuing to live together. Therefore, this case should be reconciled to prevent a happy family from being broken up. The case was adjourned indefinitely, and the two parties were directed to attempt reconciliation outside of court.</p>

The afternoon before yesterday at around 1 p.m., 石 rode a bicycle to 法華鎮 (Fǎhuá Zhèn), but has not returned since. A search has been conducted everywhere, but to no avail. He had no money on him and was only wearing a white shirt, blue striped foreign cloth pants, and bare feet with running shoes. His family is very anxious.</p>

<p>Lawyer Li was known for his charm and elegance in dress. His wife, Madam Lin, resided with Li at No. 24 Zhilan Fang, Kaizi'er Road in the French Concession. Initially, their marriage was harmonious. However, recently, Madam Lin faintly heard rumors of her husband's affair, leading to frequent quarrels. A few days ago, another argument erupted, and Madam Lin angrily returned to Ningbo. Subsequently, Li became even more unrestrained and rented a small apartment at No. 56, second-floor attic, Lane 645, Tiantong Road with his mistress, Wang Lizhen, practicing the adage of "keeping a beauty in a golden house." Unexpectedly, Madam Lin's return to Ningbo was a ruse. She secretly sent someone to investigate Li's activities, discovering that her husband and his mistress were living together like a married couple, openly frequenting dance halls, theaters, and parks. Simultaneously, the secret address on Tiantong Road was discovered. Initially, she consulted with a police officer at the French Concession Police Station. However, as the location fell within the International Settlement, the officer referred her to Shang Wu, the Chinese Detective Inspector in charge of the Tiantong Road jurisdiction at the Huishi Police Station. Thus, on the 2nd of this month, Inspector Shang, accompanied by Madam Lin and several Chinese and Western private detectives, arrived at No. 56, Lane 645, Tiantong Road at around 5:00 AM, knocked on the door, and went straight up to the attic. They caught the pair of "wild mandarin ducks" red-handed and temporarily detained them at the police station. The investigation is now complete, and the police have filed a public prosecution. The trial is scheduled to take place on the morning of the 15th in Criminal Court No. 8.</p>

<p>The Great White Umbrella Dharma Assembly</p>
<p>Esoteric Buddhism Flourishes in China, Dharma Assemblies Held Simultaneously in Shanghai and Singapore</p>
<p>The Great White Umbrella Prajna Dharma Assembly has been held simultaneously in Shanghai and Singapore since the 10th of this month. In Shanghai, it is jointly presided over by Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Feng Yangshan, and the three Dharma Masters, Yuanchen, Xingru, and Zhenkong. Three altars have been set up in the assembly. One is the</p>
<p>Great White Umbrella</p>
<p>ceremony conducted by Dharma Master Rongzengda. The so-called Great White Umbrella consists of a white umbrella, various Dharma instruments, and a thousand Buddha lamps on both sides, offering purified water, fragrant incense, rice, flour, and other items. The thousand lamps shine brightly, filling the room with light. In the center is offered the "Kangyur Sutra," personally spoken by Sakyamuni Buddha. This sutra has not been widely circulated in China. When the Panchen Lama came to Shanghai, he brought a copy. People in Shanghai considered this sutra rare. At that time, Mr. Duan Zhiqiao was resting in Shanghai, so Duan, along with Qu Wenliu, Feng Yangshan, and others, initiated the Bodhi Society, requesting the Panchen Lama to entrust the sutra to the society for preservation and translation into Chinese. They also invited Grand Khenpo Rongzengda to stay in Shanghai to oversee the sutra translation. This decision led to the establishment of the Dharma Assembly. Dharma Master Rongzengda vowed to benefit all beings, protect the country, and bless the people, chanting the Golden Sutra a thousand times daily from morning to evening. He also offered the Kangyur Sutra for the first time for the public to pay homage. The ritual for the cremation will be held on the 16th, and the empowerment on the 17th. Another altar is the</p>
<p>Prajna Dharma Assembly conducted by Dharma Master Chishong. Dharma Master Chishong practices the Eastern Esoteric Buddhism, while Dharma Master Rongzengda practices the Art Esoteric Buddhism, which belongs to the Yellow Sect. There is also the Red Sect of Esoteric Buddhism, prevalent in various parts of Xikang, which has also recently spread to China. In Shanghai, it is presided over by Dharma Master Shantang. Eastern Esoteric Buddhism originated in China, flowed into Japan during the Tang Dynasty, and after its prevalence in Japan, China lost its transmission. Later, Dharma Master Chishong and others reintroduced it from Japan, hence the distinction of Eastern Esoteric Buddhism. Another altar is the Great Compassion</p>
<p>Avalokiteśvara Buddha Recitation Retreat conducted by Dharma Master Yici, which belongs to the Exoteric School. Incense is offered three times daily, and the name of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva is chanted in unison. From 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM in the afternoon, Dharma Masters from various mountains are invited to lecture on the scriptures and provide guidance. Such a grand Dharma Assembly, with the perfect fusion of Esoteric and Exoteric Dharma power, is indeed a cause for joy for both humans and celestial beings.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to the statement made by the person concerned, Sun Yonghe, "Having read the Shanghai news published in the Shen Bao on the 5th of this month regarding the case of Sun Yonghe suing Shen Bide for annulment of marriage, which stated that (1) 'Having started from the money business and accumulated assets of several million, Sun Jiqing bought his daughter, Yonghe, born to his wife, Xu, at the instigation of his concubine, Lao Wu, and arranged for her to marry Shen Bide. Over several years, she had four children,' (2) 'She returned to her parents to negotiate and blamed Lao Wu for ruining her life, and since then, she has lived with her mother's family. Lao Wu took the opportunity to repeatedly slander the unfortunate daughter to Sun Jiqing and his first wife, Xu, causing Yonghe's resentment towards her parents to deepen.' All the facts are inconsistent and greatly harm the reputation of my father and stepmother. As for my previous lawsuit for alimony and recovery of deposits, it has long been withdrawn. Why bring up old news? I request your lawyers to write to the newspaper to correct this immediately and publish this letter in the 'Letters to the Editor' column to clarify the truth and correct the rumors,' etc., this lawyer hereby responds accordingly to the truth and sends this letter for handling. Sincerely, to Mr. Zhong Bi of the Zhong Bao Newspaper Office, Lawyer Lin Yingqing, June 7th, 28th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>"I recently saw in your newspaper on June 7th a news item titled 'Fan Gencai's County Reward Wanted Tao Xisheng,' and I was very surprised. Upon investigation, Xisheng and Captain Fan are comrades-in-arms and have always looked out for each other and helped each other, acting with sincerity and openness. Moreover, Xisheng is dedicated to providing relief to refugees and promoting rural education in the Caohejing area. What is meant by 'evil forces'? Therefore, all the sections in your newspaper's report are clearly attempts by someone to deliberately create confusion, divide people's hearts, and sow discord. I am writing this letter specifically to clarify the situation and request that this letter be published in the 'Letters to the Editor' column to correct the record. Respectfully submitted to the Editor of the Shen Bao, Tao Xisheng, 28.6.11."</p>

<h3 id="e64">Overview of Vocational Education in China (V) Investigating Industry to Improve Vocational Education; Vocational School Assistance Focuses on Mechanical Engineering <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Curriculum Compilation and Examination</p>
<p>Vocational schools often independently edit their teaching materials for each subject, but the content varies in detail and has its own strengths and weaknesses, requiring urgent improvement to emphasize teaching and learning. In the 24th year, the Ministry of Education ordered 73 vocational schools in various provinces and cities with relatively good results to compile and submit self-edited lecture notes or practical teaching materials that had been tested for a considerable period and were considered suitable for application. More than 300 types were submitted. After investigation, many good copies were found that could be used. Therefore, the Shanghai Commercial Press was commissioned to hire experts from various subjects to form a review committee to carefully examine and revise them. Lecture notes deemed publishable were then printed and sold by the press. By the 27th year, a total of 72 types had been published or were about to be published. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education found the mechanical workshop practice program drafted by the Shanghai Private China Vocational School to be usable. The program was sent to eight industrial vocational schools with relatively good results for them to provide comments. Currently, the schools have submitted their comments to the Ministry of Education for transfer to the China Vocational School for handling. Once this program is finalized, it can serve as the basis for mechanical workshop practice in various schools. In the 27th year, the Ministry of Education, due to the promulgation of curriculum standards for civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and telecommunications, and the lack of suitable textbooks on the market, specially designated the National Central Industrial Tongji University Affiliated High School and the China Vocational School to start editing separately, with a deadline for completion and submission to the Ministry for review, with appropriate subsidies from the Ministry to encourage them. Regarding books for midwifery and nursing, the respective specialized committees have already compiled and sent them to print. Other teaching materials for agriculture, industry, and commerce will also be compiled after the curriculum standards are promulgated.</p>
<p>Vocational Survey</p>
<p>The main raw materials produced in each province and city, and the new industries that urgently need to be established in each locality, are of great importance to the promotion of vocational education. In September of the 23rd year, the Ministry of Education specially created a survey form on the types of industries in each province and city, as well as the existing and planned subjects of vocational schools, ordering the education departments of each province and city to investigate and fill in the form item by item. The results of the survey were organized and published in September of the 24th year. The Ministry also issued a notice to all provinces and cities, instructing them to strictly abide by the situations where the existing subjects in each province and city were not closely related to the types of industries in each province and city, and the measures that should be taken to improve the situation in the future.</p>
<p>In February of the 24th year, the Ministry also issued a survey form on major handicrafts, ordering the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to work with the construction departments to fill in detailed information on the name, location, required materials, required tools, working methods, wages and treatment, learning methods and required time, output quantity, sales channels, the future of the industry, and suggestions for improvement for each major handicraft. Most provinces and cities have complied and submitted the forms to the Ministry. When the forms are organized in the future, they can serve as a reference for the implementation of vocational supplementary education in various places.</p>
<p>In the 27th year, the Ministry of Education believed that the experience of elderly farmers in our country had reference and research value. It specially created a form, including eleven types such as water conservancy, meteorology, pests and diseases, horticulture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and handed it over to the provinces to order vocational school staff and students to conduct investigations within a time limit and submit them to the Ministry of Education for research.</p>
<p>Vocational School Assistance</p>
<p>Since vocational schools require heavy equipment and large expenses, the state should provide subsidies to show encouragement. The Ministry of Education presented a proposal to the Executive Yuan, which approved the establishment of subsidies for excellent public and private vocational schools starting in the 25th year. The amount of the subsidies would be allocated from more than one-half of the production education funds each year by the Ministry of Education. The use of the funds would be limited to expanding the practical training and research equipment of vocational subjects and the salaries of specialized teachers. It was also stipulated that vocational schools in agriculture and industry should account for 80 to 90 percent of the total subsidy amount each year, and vocational schools in commerce and home economics should account for 10 to 20 percent each year. The education departments of each province and city should select one or two public and private vocational schools under their jurisdiction that have achieved excellent results and are experiencing financial difficulties and apply to the Ministry of Education for subsidies. In the 25th year, the total amount of the subsidies was 430,000 yuan. There were more than 60 schools in various provinces and cities that applied for subsidies. After review by the review committee, subsidies were approved for 48 schools, including 20 in industrial subjects, 12 in agricultural subjects, 3 in commercial subjects, and 5 in home economics subjects. In the 26th year, the total amount of subsidies was 400,000 yuan. Subsidies were approved for 53 schools, including 45 industrial schools and 8 agricultural and other subject schools. In the 27th year, the total amount of subsidies was 140,000 yuan. Approval was granted to 15 schools, mostly industrial schools. Since the 26th year, the aforementioned subsidies have focused on the completion of equipment for mechanical engineering vocational schools, followed by agricultural schools. In the future, attention should be gradually paid to the enrichment of subjects such as wool weaving, cotton weaving, and leather making, and the establishment of primary practical vocational schools.</p>

<p>Introducing the Republic of China Map of the South China Islands</p>
<p>Compiled by Tan Lian</p>
<p>The Map of the South China Islands of the Republic of China, compiled by Tan Lian of Wujin, includes all the islands in the South China Sea of our country. In addition to a part of the land, (including Guangdong, Guangxi, the entire province, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, most of the Xinle Railway and highway have been added), there are Dongsha Island. Xisha Islands. Nansha Islands. Tuan Sha Islands and other islands, of which Tuan Sha Islands are of great importance to our country's national boundaries, because there are nine small islands in the islands that were occupied by France in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Many textbooks have not been carefully examined, or mistakenly believe that the nine small islands are the entire Tuan Sha Islands, or mistakenly believe that the Anbona Reef, the southernmost of the nine small islands, is the southern border of our country, and the loss of sovereignty is the most serious. This map includes all ninety-six small islands of the Tuan Sha Islands. The nine small islands occupied by France are marked with double red lines to distinguish them from other islands. The five-color shadow is clear at a glance, and the back is attached with an article on the southern border that our country urgently needs to correct, as well as a table of Chinese and Western comparisons of the islands. Those who study geography and pay attention to national boundaries should purchase and read it as soon as possible in order to understand the true meaning. The fixed price is two jiao and five fen, and the current special price is two jiao. It is issued by the China Geography Society at 38 Xinmin Village, Malang Road.</p>

<h3 id="e69">On Chinese Medical Art (II) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Citing Ancient Texts</p>
<p>An edict of the ancients: "Those who treat from the inside to the outside, regulate the inside; those who treat from the outside to the inside, treat the outside; those who treat from the outside to the inside and its manifestation is outside, first regulate the inside and then treat the outside; those who treat from the outside to the inside and its manifestation is inside, first treat the outside and then treat the inside; if the inside and outside are unrelated, then treat the primary disease." (Plain Questions - 至眞耍大論) Also, "Supplement those above and below by following them, treat those above and below by going against them, and regulate them according to the cold, heat, abundance, and deficiency of their locations. Therefore, it is said to take from above, take from below, take from inside, take from outside, to seek out their excess. For those who can tolerate poison, use strong medicine; for those who cannot tolerate poison, use mild medicine. If the disease is above, take from below; if the disease is below, take from above; if the disease is in the middle, take from the sides. Treat heat with cold, warm it and circulate it; treat cold with heat, cool it and circulate it; treat warmth with coolness, refrigerate it and circulate it; treat coolness with warmth, heat it and circulate it; therefore, eliminate it, reduce it, vomit it out, purge it downwards, supplement it, drain it, treat the old and the new alike." (Five Constant Movements - 政大論) Also: "Some seek at the manifestation and seek it at the manifestation; some seek at the root and seek it at the root; some seek at the root and seek it at the manifestation; some seek at the manifestation and seek it at the root. Therefore, treatment sometimes gains by addressing the manifestation, sometimes gains by addressing the root, sometimes gains by treating in reverse, and sometimes gains by treating in accordance. Treating against is reversing, treating successfully is in accordance. For minor or major disadvantage, treat the manifestation; for minor or major advantage, treat the root; if the disease develops with excess, addressing the root targets the manifestation, first treat the root and then treat the manifestation. If the disease develops with deficiency, addressing the manifestation targets the root, first treat the manifestation and then treat the root. Carefully observe the intervals and severities, and regulate them according to intention." (On Manifestation, Root, and Disease Transmission - 標本病傳論) Also: "What is reversing and following? Reversing is orthodox treatment, following is paradoxical treatment, following little, following much, observe the matter. What is paradoxical treatment? It is using heat for heat, using cold for cold, using blockage for blockage, using flow for flow, always subduing what is primary, and prioritizing what caused it; the beginning is the same, but the end is different, it can be used to break accumulations, it can be used to dissolve hardness, it can be used to harmonize qi, it can be used to surely heal."</p>
<p>The above quotes, and others like them, are commonly seen in ancient books and are used as vibrant raw material in this short essay. Readers may at times feel an indescribable profundity, which is due to the conciseness of ancient texts, and requires further explanation to comprehend. But here there is no time to explain each one, and it is impossible to cite the commentaries of various schools to expand this length. In short, everything quoted above is indeed a clever artistic technique. If one wants to explain that Chinese medicine is an art, then these ancient words are good to cite, a myriad times superior to the magic spells of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, and can be called the south-pointing needle of Chinese medicine, showing future generations the mysteries that cannot be explicitly stated. Therefore, ancient books also say: "Treating cold with heat, treating heat with cold, cannot be constrained by rules, but changes its path."</p>
<p>What is quoted above can still be said to be the old, useless words of Han Dynasty medical classics, and is no longer suitable for modern application. However, the writings of physicians from the late Ming Dynasty, such as Li Zhongzi's "Essentials for Physicians," are still recited by contemporary doctors and common practitioners. There is an essay called "Using Medicine – Essential Knowledge of the Inner Canon's Methods," which may as well be copied below to show that the medical classics of the Han Dynasty, despite their age, have not diminished in value, and that the application of Chinese medical art vividly exists under the fingertips of contemporary doctors and common practitioners. The essay says:</p>
<p>"The difficulty in using medicine is not in using it in accordance, nor in using it in reverse; the difficulty in using it in reverse is not in using it in reverse, but in using it appropriately for the disease. Today's physicians only know to treat heat with cold, to treat cold with heat, to treat blockage with flow, to treat flow with blockage, to completely heat those who are hot, and to completely cool those who are cold! Have they not heard the various classics say: 'Use blockage for blockage, use flow for flow, use heat for cold, use cold for heat, use heat far from heat, use cold far from cold'? What is the explanation for this? Blockage used for blockage is like spleen deficiency causing bloating, treating it with ginseng and atractylodes, the spleen is supplemented and the bloating naturally disappears; flow used for flow is like typhoid fever with heat causing diarrhea, or with dry stool in the middle, using 調胃承氣湯 to purge it downwards and it is safe; persistent dysentery that does not stop, use medicinal soup to open it and it heals; cold used for heat, the medicine is inherently cold, but counter-supplementing it with heat; heat used for cold, the medicine is inherently hot, but counter-supplementing it with cold, so that there is no risk of rejection. This is what is called 'first subdue what is targeted and subdue what caused it'. Using heat far from heat, using cold far from cold, like a cold disease should be treated with hot medicine, a hot disease should be treated with cold medicine, only to make it suitable for the disease, do not overuse it, overuse it and it will be medicine that harms you." (Feng's note: The explanation of the classics here has inconsistencies, doubts remain!) Like the previous methods, those who are not enlightened are not qualified to speak of this! Therefore, it is said: "Disease has no constant form, medicine has no constant formula, medicine has no constant quality, following, reversing, advancing, retreating, exist with the same time, divine sagacity and skill exist with the person, sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy exist with its use...""</p>
<p>Li Shicai also said in his essay "On Bitterly Desiring Supplementation and Drainage": "...Those who are good at using medicine do not abandon the standard, nor are they confined to the standard. For example, if heat should be treated with cold, but using cold causes the fire and heat to be reborn; if cold should be treated with heat, but giving heat makes the sinking cold even worse, this is the harm of liking attack and increasing qi. Treating cold has a method, one should supplement heart yang, treating heat has authority, one should nourish kidney water, this is the wonder of seeking the root source. Supplementing heart yang, cold will also flow, strengthening kidney yin, heat can still be contained, this is the method of change and divine transformation..."</p>
<p>To speak on a smaller scale, regardless of diagnosis, but discussing the use of medicine, the formulas and medicines prescribed by contemporary doctors and common practitioners, which they obtain from the teacher-student inheritance passed down from generation to generation, also have their own ingenuity, under the fingers of each practitioner. Doctors say about using medicine: adding qi medicine to blood-regulating medicine, first nourishing blood in wind-treating medicine, also regulating qi in water-promoting medicine, also adding qi-regulating medicine in dampness-regulating medicine, adding digestion-promoting medicine to supplementing medicine, adding slow-acting medicine to exterior-releasing medicine, supplementing with a compliant agent in purgative medicine, adding a restraining agent to exterior-cold medicine, and adding a harmonizing agent to fever-reducing medicine. Other examples include cold and heat counteracting each other, dispersing and astringing each other, addressing both the exterior and interior, and complementing the upper and lower, all of which are small artistic techniques, incomparable to the simple, immature formulas of treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts. Furthermore, with the addition of complex formulas and extraordinary formulas, etc., their artistic ingenuity is naturally in mind.</p>
<p>All of the above is well-known to modern doctors, so when treating diseases, once a syndrome is identified, the entire medical skill is measured on the patient's body, where to go and where to come from, one can naturally be handy. Therefore, talk of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements can be discarded aside, they are truly the words of deceitful sorcerers, without the grand purpose of academic learning. As for Chinese medicine before the occurrence of Yin-Yang theory, it already had its classics; after the occurrence of Yin-Yang theory, it also had its progress. It is a long story, and I will not elaborate here.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Treatment</p>
<h3 id="e70">Principles of Handling Traumatic Injuries <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Kewen</p>
<p>The German Society for Field Science, at the request of the National Federation of Industrial Employees and the National Federation of Agricultural Employees, held a meeting in Munich on October 26 of last year. Participants included Schmiedeu, ZurVerth, Heller, Maguus, Bochler, and Buerklede．la　Ccamp. They specifically drafted the "Principles for Handling Traumatic Injuries" as a reference for the medical community. The translator believes that in the country, the number of traumatic injury events, whether in wartime or after the war, will inevitably increase rapidly, while doctors lack adequate guidelines when handling traumatic injuries. The sections proposed by the society are simple and clear, and are translated here for the benefit of colleagues. (The original text can be found in the sixth issue of the "Surgeon" magazine of the previous month.)</p>
<p>A. Treatment of Traumatic Injuries</p>
<p>1.  Clean, ordinary, and minor traumatic injuries, without serious suspicion of infection, must be treated immediately by a doctor and must be under the doctor's supervision daily. However, this type of trauma does not require surgery.</p>
<p>2.  Except for the above, all other types of traumatic injuries must be dealt with by the doctor with the strictest and most aggressive attitude. Traumatic injuries within six to eight hours after injury can be called "fresh traumatic injuries," but this limit depends on the circumstances of the occurrence and the location of the injury. Sometimes it can be extended to within twelve hours. Doctors in various regions may also determine this time according to their experience in their service locations.</p>
<p>3.  The doctor's purpose of treatment is to thoroughly surgically remove the entire wound surface and the deep parts of the wound.</p>
<p>4.  Any ointment bandage cannot replace surgery, nor can it assist in the inadequacy of surgery.</p>
<p>5.  Shallow and easily visible traumatic injuries can be sparsely sutured after strict excision. If the wound is deep, such as a muscle wound, then a drainage site must be left outside the suture.</p>
<p>6.  Deep and difficult-to-inspect traumatic injuries, or those that cannot be thoroughly excised due to anatomical location, and can only be surgically removed from contaminated and corrupted tissues, as well as those considered to have a great risk of infection and tissues that have been chemically damaged, must not be sutured. All traumatic injuries with bends and bottoms must be drained. But sometimes a few stitches may be slightly stitched to maintain it.</p>
<p>7.  The most easily infected traumatic injuries are bite wounds, scratch wounds, poisonous surgical wounds, chemical laboratory wounds, veterinary wounds, fish market butcher wounds, and wounds of workers in sewers and waterways, etc. Traumatic injuries that have been chemically damaged, such as being punctured by the tip of an ink pen.</p>
<p>8.  Fresh joint ruptures must be sutured at least with the skin after the excision. Open fractures, if the bone tissue is not very broken and there is no infectious risk of dirt, can be sutured after the wound excision. Otherwise, it cannot be sutured.</p>
<p>9.  After the treatment of traumatic injuries, absolute rest must be provided and cannot be interrupted.</p>
<p>10. Traumatic injury excision or other procedures for treating traumatic injuries must have adequate equipment (sterilization) and sufficient surgical experience.</p>
<p>B. Tetanus Prevention</p>
<p>1.  The above-mentioned strict traumatic injury excision is a prerequisite for preventing tetanus.</p>
<p>2.  All traumatic injuries at risk of tetanus, such as street injuries, farm injuries, or injuries, foot injuries through shoes and socks, car injuries, open broken injuries, and wood splinter injuries, etc., must be injected with an appropriate amount of tetanus antitoxin serum to prevent it.</p>
<p>3.  The necessity of tetanus serum injection can be implemented based on the local situation of tetanus occurrence.</p>
<p>4.  Tetanus serum is quite capable of preventing the occurrence of tetanus, to a considerable extent, but cannot absolutely guarantee that it will not occur. In Germany, the risk of tetanus infection is very small. Conversely, injecting tetanus serum is not an absolutely risk-free thing, so not injecting serum cannot be absolutely regarded as the doctor's fault. (Translator's note: According to the experience of the suburbs of this city during the war, it is estimated that 5 out of 1,000 people are infected with tetanus after shrapnel wounds, so injection of serum for prevention is absolutely necessary in my opinion).</p>
<p>C. Gas Gangrene</p>
<p>Ordinary surgery has very little experience with gas gangrene. Wound excision is also the most effective way to prevent the development of anaerobic bacteria, and drainage tubes must be placed. According to the war experience of the British and French, serum is very effective, but serum therapy for gas gangrene has not yet matured.</p>
<p>Biographies of Medical Professionals</p>
<h3 id="e71">A Brief Biography of Robert Koch, the Founder of German Bacteriology (Continued from Issue 31) <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zuanzeng</p>
<p>Three Major Works of His Life</p>
<p>During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, Koch enlisted in the volunteer army. On his way home after the armistice, he was appointed medical officer of Bomst County. In his spare time, he privately set up a small laboratory to study anthrax. At that time, countless people and animals suffered from it. For twenty years, doctors had wanted to investigate this problem, and Koch could not be an exception. In 1876, he published the results of his many years of experiments: how to find anthrax bacteria, cultivation methods, and its elimination methods, and from then on, the public recognized that "a specific bacterium causes a specific disease."</p>
<p>Guided by Koch, later generations gradually discovered pathogens such as typhoid, malaria, and leprosy. He then engaged in research on tetanus in his private laboratory, but many difficulties prevented success. In 1880, he was called into the Royal Institute of Hygiene to work. At that time, the facilities were complete and progress was much greater. For example, the steam sterilization method he invented is still indispensable for bacterial work today.</p>
<p>On March 24, 1882, at the Berlin Physiological Society, Koch reported that he had discovered the tubercle bacillus. Humanity then understood that tuberculosis actually had its pathogen, and was definitely not due to nutritional disorders. Other diseases such as skin tuberculosis and bone tuberculosis were also caused by this bacillus.</p>
<p>The following year (1883), he was appointed as a ship doctor. The reason he accepted this appointment was not to enjoy the pleasure of sailing, but to facilitate the study of tropical infectious diseases. At that time, cholera was prevalent in Africa, and was about to spread to India, Egypt, and Europe. Koch then formed a cholera team to Africa, not afraid of the scorching sun. In the simplest laboratory, he obtained the cholera vibrio, which was due to water contamination. He then studied rinderpest in Africa and human plague (i.e., the Black Death) in India, proving that the occurrence of plague was actually caused by plague bacteria. The bacteria breed in rats and are transmitted to humans by fleas. He then organized an expedition to study the tsetse fly disease and Texas fever.</p>
<p>In 1885, he was appointed as a professor of hygiene at the University of Berlin, and at the same time continued his research work, unlike the average teacher who only reads books. In 1891, he was appointed as the director of a specially established bacteriology institute, which is today the Robert Koch Institute on Fehrer Street in Berlin. Koch encouraged himself privately: "Don't let go!" The reason why he was able to make new discoveries repeatedly was because he did not relax in the slightest. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Finance: Although Foreign Exchange is Stable, the Gold Rush Rises Again <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>New Peak Reaches 2,570 Yuan, Gold Prices Have Not Yet Risen Enough Based on Black Market Calculations, but are Still Double the Price at the Outbreak of the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot market situation showed that although foreign exchange had stabilized, the gold market was still in extreme chaos. Prices rose sharply and endlessly, reaching an unprecedented peak of 2,570 yuan at the close. This was because some operators believed that based on the British gold price on the black market, the gold price should have risen to 1,733 yuan, and based on the U.S. exchange rate, it should have risen to 2,767 yuan and 9 jiao. Since the sharp rise in foreign exchange, the British gold exchange rate has reached 1.75, and the U.S. exchange rate has also softened by 3.40625 yuan. Based on this price reduction, the entire market should rise by 577 yuan. However, gold has risen wildly for six consecutive days, totaling 476 yuan, so there is still a difference of more than 100 yuan from this price. As a result, all parties' bullish expectations and wait-and-see attitudes are still very strong. In the morning, a certain bank (acting for foreign firms) and a certain gold shop (acting for the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs) competed to increase prices and drag in. It was expected that another gold firm's long positions would profit and exit, but it still felt like a drop in the bucket. The market was firm. In the afternoon, a certain bank (acting for foreign firms) was ordered to profit and exit, but a certain gold firm suddenly stopped and advanced sharply, so the market finally saw an upward victory. As a result, the market closed at a peak price, 103 yuan higher than last Saturday. Because there were many scalpers in the trading, it was even more lively. The total turnover for the whole day reached more than 5,000 taels. Jewelry gold shops also followed suit with a leap of 10 yuan, producing an unprecedented record of 260 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Crude Gold Rises Another Hundred Yuan: From the opening at 9:30 a.m. (per bar, 10 taels), it was 3 yuan higher than last Saturday. A certain money changer bought 50 taels from a jewelry shop gang at a price of 2,470 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be soft, and sellers were rare, so the price soared. A certain money changer bought more than 100 taels from the jewelry shop gang and gold shops at a price that was raised to 2,500 yuan. Later, because the jewelry shop gang and gold shops competed to sell, the market turned weak and once returned to 2,480 yuan. Most of the absorption was done by a certain bank (acting for the Hong Kong gang). After that, a certain gold shop acting for the Guangdong gang poured in a large amount. At the same time, a certain money changer rose again to collect. Although there were cash shops and jewelry shop gangs repeatedly limiting prices to get out one after another, there were many more buyers, so the price soared again by 44 yuan, breaking through the 500 yuan mark. A money changer sold 90 taels to a certain gold shop at a price as high as 2,530 yuan. Later, it was heard that after the foreign exchange was dumped by Hong Kong telegraph, there was an echo, which caused a treasure wind. Money changers and gold shops came to sell again, and a certain broker (acting for the Northern gang) also tended to exit, but the Guangdong gang took the opportunity to pull up the price and accept it. Money changers mutually traded 50 taels, once retreated to 2,504 yuan. After 11:30 a.m., the sellers' intentions weakened, and a certain gold shop's suction became stronger, so the rising wind re-emerged, and soared again by 28 yuan. At 11:45 a.m., it soared to 2,530 yuan. Later, gold shops mutually traded 50 taels at a price of 2,529 yuan as the closing price for the afternoon. In the afternoon, a certain gold shop, which had always been exiting, suddenly came back to advance, and the market was even firmer. At two o'clock, the opening immediately raised by 4 yuan. A certain gold shop advanced 50 taels from the money changer at a price of 533 yuan, and then advanced another 50 taels from the money changer at a price of 132 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold shop continued to advance sharply, and the guest gangs also followed suit to buy. Therefore, although a certain bank acting for foreign firms limited the price to profit and exit, it still felt like there was too little porridge for too many monks. The price then advanced towards the peak. A certain bank advanced 50 taels from the gold shop, and it rose to the 2,560 yuan mark. At that time, a certain bank continued to sell, and scalpers also exhausted their strength at the high price, so it was once pressed down to 904 yuan. At 3:40 p.m., a certain gold shop's buying intention re-emerged, and a certain money changer acting for the wealthy also digested it, so the rising wind re-emerged, soaring by 30 yuan. At four o'clock, a certain gold shop advanced 90 taels from a certain bank, and a certain money changer advanced 50 taels from the same industry, with prices all at 2,570 yuan, setting a new unprecedented record. After this, there were many sellers at 570 yuan, but a certain gold shop and a certain money changer stopped advancing and waited and watched. However, the jewelry shop gang returned the price of 565 yuan to buy, but there was no transaction, so it still closed at a high price of 2,570 yuan. As a result, it soared again by 103 yuan compared with the closing on the weekend. It has been found that it has risen for six consecutive days, totaling a huge 476 yuan. The fluctuations throughout the day were very large, with a distance of 105 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold is about 10 yuan higher than the spot price. The current standard gold price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there are very few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold at 260 Yuan</p>
<p>Jewelry gold from jewelry shops, the initial opening price offered by the large shops was still 250 yuan per tael. At 9:45 a.m., the price was unanimously raised by 3 yuan. At 11:25 a.m., it rose again by 3 yuan. At 3 p.m., it was raised by a big 4 yuan. There were no changes after that. The large shops actually offered 260 yuan, while the new shops offered 258 yuan and bought in at 252 yuan, all of which are unprecedented peak prices, equal to twice the gold price after the outbreak of the Shanghai War.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unmoved: The buying price of Chinese cash by the Central Bank is still 1,211 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold price is still flat, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard gold price is also still 1,206 yuan and 9 jiao, which is due to the London telegram on the 10th reporting that British pure gold was fixed at £7, 8 shillings, and 5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Importers Frequently Settle Accounts, Foreign Exchange is Stable with a Slight Tightening <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Still Has a Continuous Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation showed that the HSBC listing had no changes. The off-market situation was quite stable, and the market price was slightly softened, because Texaco Oil Company and other foreign firms frequently settled accounts, and Japanese spinning factories and Western firm Sassoon also settled accounts at one time. Although Hong Kong telegraph continued to supply, because foreign firms such as HSBC were only willing to maintain the listed price, the result was that British exchange tightened by 0.03125 and U.S. exchange softened by 0.0625. Transactions were flat. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to tighten sharply because money changers and foreign firms had a strong buying intention and Chinese and foreign banks had a rather weak selling appetite.</p>
<p>Japanese Spinning Factories Also Come to Settle Accounts</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London large bars continued to shrink by 0.0625, the New York silver price was fixed, the London raw gold remained flat, the exchange rate of British to U.S. was 3 cents, and to Shanghai and France were flat. The U.S. to British was longer by 0.0625, to Shanghai was smaller by 1 jiao, and to France was unchanged. The Central Bank listed the various exchange rates as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 6.53125 pence for British exchange and 11.6875 yuan for U.S. exchange, softer than last weekend, British exchange tightened by 0.03125 and U.S. exchange softened by 0.0625. After the opening, because major import firms settled a large number of accounts, coupled with the sluggish supply from foreign banks, and HSBC was only willing to maintain the listed price, the market was slightly softer. It was estimated that foreign firms settled and advanced HSBC spot British gold at 6.5 pence. When the HSBC listing was announced, it did not move, and the silver balance was announced to be smaller by 0.25, calculated at 2.75%. After that, foreign firms and Japanese spinning factories successively settled large amounts of spot British gold at the same price with 大通、华比、有利 banks at 6.5 pence, and spot U.S. exchange at 12.6875 yuan. At that time, Hong Kong telegraph continued to sell, and it was immediately rebounded. Hong Kong telegraph sold spot British gold at 6.53125 pence to foreign firms. Near noon, the foreign banks' intention to supply Hong Kong exchange was quite weak, and the selling price had softened to 45.25 yuan. Extended to the afternoon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 6.93125 pence for British gold and 12.6875 yuan for U.S. exchange, not much different from the morning opening.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Continues to Shrink and is Still Fierce</p>
<p>In the later market, Hong Kong telegraph continued to sell British gold at 6.5 pence to Western firm Sassoon. Then, HSBC and 麦加利 banks also sold spot British gold at 6.5 pence to foreign firms, and also sold June's shillings at the same price to foreign firms. Later, a certain bank also sold spot U.S. exchange at 12.6875 yuan to Texaco Oil Company. The market was calm. After entering, 华行、广东 banks sold spot Hong Kong exchange to money changers, softening to 44.5 yuan. By the late closing, the bank's spot selling price was 6.53125 pence for British exchange and 12.6875 yuan for U.S. exchange, no different from the morning opening. As a result, compared with the afternoon closing on the previous weekend, British exchange was tighter by 0.03125, U.S. exchange was softer by 0.065, and Hong Kong exchange was fiercely shrunk by 1.25 yuan based on the transaction price. Now, a record of the opening transaction for the day is recorded later.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold remained unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate decreased by 0.0625. Yesterday, foreign exchange transactions in the local market were active among foreign firms settling accounts. Foreign banks provided ample supply, and the market was slightly soft. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6.5%, and the US exchange rate was 12.625 yuan, increasing by 0.0625 and 0.125 respectively compared to last Saturday. The Shanghai Gold Bar opened firm and showed considerable strength, with market sentiment being quite bullish and most people expecting prices to rise. A rising trend quickly resurfaced, and gold dealers and speculators actively absorbed supply. Inventory became very scarce, and supply was not smooth. This resulted in a new record high of 2,532 yuan. In the afternoon, market conditions were even more bullish, with gold dealers and money changers showing even stronger buying interest. Gold prices continued to advance towards new highs, closing at a peak of 2,570 yuan, which was 103 yuan higher than last Saturday. There were still buyers after the market closed. Based on the settlement price of the British exchange rate, the gold price was 2,740 yuan, so new highs are still to be discovered. Due to the soaring Shanghai Gold Bar, the demand for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds was very high, and market prices rose sharply again. British and American gold notes were more expensive because the exchange rate was softer and the supply was not smooth. Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Dutch notes all tended to rise due to the impact of the weak exchange rate. The Japanese yen failed to rally and tended to loosen. The evening price for Japanese gold notes was 0.98 yuan, and Korean notes were 0.85 yuan. The guild did not open for trading. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose 2.10 yuan, British gold notes rose 0.60 yuan, US gold pounds rose 3.00 yuan, US gold notes rose 0.02 yuan, Hong Kong notes rose 0.05 yuan, French franc notes rose 0.003 yuan, Singapore notes rose 0.06 yuan, Dutch notes rose 0.05 yuan, Annam notes rose 0.02 yuan, Rupee notes rose 0.08 yuan, Canadian notes rose 0.10 yuan, Philippine notes rose 0.05 yuan, Italian notes rose 0.005 yuan, German gold notes rose 0.10 yuan, Australian gold notes rose 0.20 yuan, and Siamese notes rose 0.10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Will Old Banknotes Be Used as Circulating Notes? Is the Central Government Collecting Copper Coins? <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors in the market that the banknotes of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) will be tightened, and the banknotes of various commercial banks received before the unification of banknotes will be used in the market to avoid the drain of foreign exchange. The origin of this statement is suspected to be an association with the report that the storage of banknotes from various banks is lacking. According to investigations, some banks may use old commercial bank notes (miscellaneous banknotes) for payments. However, this situation occurred around the time of the outbreak of the Shanghai war, when depositors rushed to withdraw their deposits and banknotes were in short supply for a time, resulting in a greater outflow of old banknotes. Recently, some banks have used old banknotes and also four bank banknotes to pay out deposits. Since the market does not discriminate against various banknotes, there is no problem. As for foreign banks recognizing the four banknotes as legal tender, this did not begin today. How the situation will evolve in the future, even to the point of issuing circulating notes to resist unprepared banknotes, or even using the function of miscellaneous banknotes as circulating notes, is currently just speculation and does not need to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Some people are defending a certain party for the shortage of copper coins, saying that the central government is also collecting them. This was indeed seen in last year's announcement from the Chinese side, referring to the war zone or the interior, to prevent them from being rented in the future. As for the actual situation, one can observe that the interior has far more copper coins than Shanghai, and Shanghai did not feel a shortage of copper coins for almost a year after the Chinese army withdrew, which shows that it is not the case. It was not until the last half year that the situation of depletion became apparent. Therefore, according to their saying, since the copper coins currently collected by the central government have no possibility of being shipped out, storing them in Shanghai is not a good idea. Moreover, why wait until a year later, when the environment is deteriorating day by day, to start buying again? The facts clearly show which party is responsible, so why bring out the "central government" to be a scapegoat for them? It is deplorable!</p>

<p>The securities grey market remained extremely firm yesterday, showing signs of rapid advancement. Type A bonds surged to a high price of 63.60 yuan on January 10, setting a new record and also the highest price seen since August 13. Type C bonds also broke through the high price of 53.85 yuan on April 21 and broke through the 4-yuan mark. The rest were also new highs for the recent market. There were various rumors in the market, and it was impossible to investigate the truth. Some said it was inflation, some said it was the issuance of circulating notes, and some said the atmosphere of peace was浓浓again, all of which were just conjectures. In fact, the strength of the bulls among the major players was not to be underestimated. At this high price, they were not only unwilling to let go but even engaged in adding more positions, or even using other people's names to avoid attention. This is a good phenomenon since the war. Moreover, the rise in market prices was not due to short covering but still due to the addition of positions by the bulls. As the market opened yesterday, prices rose. Xinfengyong bought in enthusiastically. Runlixingyuan and the sellers of Nos. 5 and 20 were weak and far from being a match for the bulls. Although Lianhe, Tongrun, Nos. 7, 16, and 42 sold, the difference between supply and demand was still far apart. Therefore, the prices rose by 0.35 to 0.55 yuan in the morning. The market atmosphere was very firm in the afternoon. Type C bonds suddenly broke through the 4-yuan mark, and Type A bonds even surged to a high price of 3.60 yuan. Xinfengyong continued to buy in very enthusiastically. Tiansheng, Fuda, Yuji, and Lemao all bought in one after another. Sellers Tongkang, Tongrun, Hongda, and Hengfu sold off slightly. No. 35 also sold off slightly. Retail investors bought more than they sold. Market prices were very firm. As a result, prices rose by 0.85 to 1.10 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 1.5 million yuan. The following is a brief table: Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A | 63.95 | 63.00 | 63.85 | +1.05</p>
<p>Unified B | 55.85 | 55.10 | 55.70 | +0.85</p>

<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of Shanghai Electric Stock were traded at a price of 5.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Kaida Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm in this city, decided yesterday at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 0.10 yuan per share (national currency) for the current term (i.e., from October 1, 1938, to the end of September 1939), it is said. Yesterday was the largest spot delivery day in the history of the Zhongye Guild. The morning suspension board was also assisted by the bank, which allowed the extension of the bill settlement to 2:30 p.m. The guild was able to clear all deliveries. The afternoon trading time was very short, but the market atmosphere was very lively, and the price fluctuations were minimal. Jardine Matheson shares rose to 22 yuan, and the China General Edison Company 8% bond price rose to 81 taels. Trolley shares were in good demand, with a price of 43.75 yuan, and the transaction price was also this price. Some bulls of Shanghai Land Investment Company shares and ______ shares sold to take profits, but ______ the trend was firm. The buying price of Shanghai Silver Company shares was 7.60 yuan, and the buying price of ______ shares was 7.30 yuan.

<h3 id="e77">Yarn and Cloth: The Financial Sector Also Starts to Search for Goods; the Rising Trend of Cotton Yarn Intensifies <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Each brand jumps by about 20 yuan; factory prices are also quite impressive.</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to be firm, and the rising trend was fierce, with a tendency to intensify further. This is because buyers are gathering, hoarding is very strong, and there is not enough inventory to distribute for a time, so market prices are advancing straight ahead. It is said that the financial sector is also searching for goods in the market, and the peak price of 20-count Double Horse yarn has reached 494 yuan.</p>
<p>When the spot yarn market opened in the morning, there were many rumors, and buyers were in a strong mood, with opening prices increasing by 3 to 5 yuan. The price of a Double Horse warehouse order for 10-count yarn was 470 yuan, and the price outside the warehouse once reached 480 yuan. The special Jin Cheng yarn reached 510 yuan, only 5 yuan lower than the peak price of last year. The price of Shepherd yarn was 400 yuan, which was dozens of bales traded by the industry. After a while, buyers crowded in, and the shouting was very strong. Fortunately, some major yarn merchants, such as so-and-so, believed that the recent increase had been large and sold out half of their holdings, which slightly eased the market situation. At the same time, the sales of spot goods were not extensive. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn outside the warehouse fell back to 476 yuan, but the market price of warehouse orders was not loose. By the close, major players such as so-and-so came to buy again, and the market rose again. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn outside the warehouse was 482 yuan, and the price of warehouse orders was 476 yuan. However, the price of 32-count Tiannv single yarn fell by 3 yuan alone due to weak demand. The opening of the market in the afternoon was still flat. Soon, the Yunnan and Hong Kong gangs made some purchases, and practitioners came to buy indiscriminately, which caused market prices to skyrocket. The high price of 20-count Bian Ma yarn was 494 yuan, and the closing price of warehouse orders was 485 yuan. It was found that the total amount bought by various gangs throughout the day was 3,535 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 20 yuan, Shepherd also rose by 15 yuan, Wufu rose by 16 yuan, others also rose by 10 yuan, and coarse yarn rose by 10 yuan. However, 32-count single yarn fell by 3 yuan. The factory opened 50 bales of 10-count special Jin Cheng yarn from Yong'an Factory at a price of 440 to 450 yuan, 50 bales of 20-count special Jin Cheng yarn at a price of 500 to 510 yuan, 10 bales of 32-count special Jin Cheng yarn at a price of 690 yuan, 1 bale of 10-count Jiahe yarn at a price of 400 yuan. Chongxin Factory opened 255 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn at a price of 380 yuan. Tongyi Factory opened 160 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn at a price of 452 yuan, 160 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster yarn at a price of 382 yuan, and 65 bales of 10-count Colored Golden Rooster yarn at a price of 290 yuan. All were cash prices, and the Yunnan gang bought them. Today, 495 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin and 85 pieces were shipped to Yantai. The following is a list of the amounts bought by each gang:</p>
<p>Industry: 1,425 Hong Kong: 680</p>
<p>Inland: 475 Shantou: 90</p>
<p>Yunnan: 740 Wenzhou: 125</p>
<p>Total: 3,535</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is also rising step by step. Although actual transactions are not strong, business ideas are frequent. The morning closing price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month was 402 yuan, and the closing price of cattle yarn was 410 yuan, an increase of 16 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Cotton futures bring up a lot of activity; the industry is very busy buying and selling.</p>
<p>Cotton transactions are still bleak, but foreign cotton business is quite prosperous. Although factory demand is sluggish, the buying and selling among the industry is very lively. From this environment, it presents a world of foreign cotton. The source of northern Jiangsu is slightly smooth, with 944 bales of cotton arriving. The following is a record of the current cotton situation:</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market: The New York cotton market is progressing more steadily and slowly today. At first, some bulls took profits and weakened, but later, because Washington has not yet made a definite statement on export subsidies and other issues, the industry is waiting and watching. Foreign cotton markets are also waiting for news from Washington as a standard for cotton market fluctuations. Yesterday, New York fell by 1 to 5 pounds of sound, India fell by 2 rupees, and predictions returned to good by more than 1 rupee. Egypt stopped trading.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions: Due to the sharp contraction of the exchange rate, foreign firm transactions are completely suspended, but mutual trafficking among the industry is quite prosperous. However, they are all speculative transactions. Before the exchange rate stabilizes and the United States determines its cotton export subsidy plan, manufacturers are unwilling to do business. Fortunately, each factory has a strong inventory, enough for four months. Foreign cotton prices will be calculated after the exchange rate stabilizes slightly.</p>

<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot sales of khaki-colored cloth and serge cloth turned active. Due to the high price of grey cloth, the selling price also rose step by step, by about 0.10 yuan per piece. The price of white goods, fine cloth, fine serge, and coarse cloth rose by 0.05 to 0.20 yuan per piece. Demand from Zhejiang continued to be strong, with the Wenzhou gang purchasing more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, serge cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, and 50 to 60 boxes of _______. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs added more than 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, serge cloth, bleached cloth, bleached serge, poplin, printed cloth, and ramie yarn. The Guangdong gang's purchase of serge cloth continued strongly, with the most active areas being the Mazhang and Shantou ports, which were transshipped from Wenzhou. Serge cloth was most popular in the Fujian and Jiangxi regions, reaching several thousand pieces. The purchasing appetite of Xinghua and other ports in northern Jiangsu was also strong, with a total of more than 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, serge cloth, and fine cloth purchased. Singapore also purchased bleached goods in an endless stream. However, the demand appetite of the Yantai and Tianjin gangs in the northern route was the weakest.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The market atmosphere was firm, and the actual sales of fine cloth and fine serge turned quiet. The "pigskin ball" trading in the market was only done for half a day yesterday due to a meeting, so speculative business was only about 1,000 pieces. However, the dark market was still expensive. The current month of the leading fine cloth was opened at 14.75 yuan, while other brands such as Yanghe and Wufu were not valued by speculators. Although the grades were the same, each piece was still called lower by 0.50 yuan, which shows that there are many non-industry people speculating in hoarding and fanning goods.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Yesterday, 900 pieces of cloth were shipped to other ports, and ______ were shipped to Wenzhou today. ______ were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Grains: Spot Flour Transactions Total More Than 100,000 Bags, and Each Bag Rises by 0.30 Yuan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot flour trading made considerable progress because the customer sales, which had been holding out for many days, had begun to move. Since the tightening of foreign exchange, the cost of foreign flour has been estimated to increase by more than 0.50 yuan. Various factories took advantage of this to hold firm. Up to yesterday, the price had risen by 0.30 yuan per bag. Customers, seeing that the market was difficult to loosen for a while, began to accept it. It is estimated that the Beiyang gang bought a total of 50,000 to 60,000 bags of flour, such as Bingchuan Pao, at a price of 4.70 yuan in remittance, and Pao Che Bie Xiao was 0.025 yuan, which was called 4.675 yuan. It is reported that the Nanyang gang also added 20,000 to 30,000 bags of flour such as Tianzhu, and there were more than 10,000 bags of retail transactions in this street and inland. The total transaction amount was more than 100,000 bags. The market continued to be firm, and the asking price for foreign flour was also expensive, and there was a lack of wholesale supply. The selling price was more expensive than factory flour. The buying and selling parties were still holding out. It is reported that the Relie brand once opened several thousand bags, and the selling price has reached 4.80 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Today, 18,700 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>New Wheat is Stocked to Await a Good Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, new wheat continued to arrive, with hundreds of bags of Nanjing Che Wheat arriving. Also, some new wheat from nearby arrived in sporadic batches of two or three. At present, because Hua Flour Factory has sufficient foreign wheat raw materials, the need for new wheat has been absent for a long time. Even Japanese merchants are just responding to social obligations and are directly distributing it, with no official market. Those who hold the goods are also planning to wait for a good price because the flour price is rising step by step. Yesterday, it was heard that the newly arrived wheat was stocked to wait for an opportunity to sell, and it was also heard that the factory-delivered Jiangbei Chen Wheat was still opened at 5.80 to 5.90 yuan. The market is temporarily seeing a stagnant situation, it is said.</p>
<p>Guangdong Gang Buys Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Kexian Hoards, Dujing Stabilizes</p>
<p>Jing Rice: The source of each gang's River Down goods has still not arrived. Wheel and Baozi have only arrived at 2,700 to 2,800 bags from the Tongkunli gang, and 2,040 bags have arrived from Hong Kong. In the early market, this street and hoarding households were also active, and industry thoughts were also good. Later, hoarding households took advantage of the high prices to sell out, and the situation was slightly reduced, turning into a stable situation. As a result, the price of thick and thin Jing rice only had a few cents of ups and downs.</p>
<p>Bian Yuan: Because a lot of foreign glutinous rice was launched, the market price was also flat under the squeeze.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: The market situation rose with people's hearts in the early morning. Yesterday, the Shantou gang was very active, buying more than 1,000 bags. The sellers, in addition to retail households, were mainly the Guangdong gang's 800 bags. Because the total inventory of foreign rice in the city was only about 10,000 bags, as soon as the Xiantou gang bought smoothly, the market price immediately rose. The initial opening price of 19.70 to 19.80 yuan was only for retail households. The wholesale transaction price was generally 19.90 yuan.</p>
<p>Kexian: The hoarding stomach is not ring, and the continuous outflow from the inland and this street caused the market to continue to rise. However, yesterday's rising wind was not as sharp as the day before yesterday, because some hoarding households sold out to take profits, and the stack-stored goods were also afraid of steaming in the hot weather, so the market price only rose by about 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. However, in the afternoon, the market widely rumored that the Wuhu origin reported a price increase of 0.50 to 0.60 yuan, and the cargo owners once again hoarded and teased, with a total of 6,000 bags of each Kexian opened out from each machine.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the sunny weather, new broad beans have appeared in most production areas. In the face of the dangerous environment where one does not worry about the next day, the purpose of farmers in various places is to obtain money as soon as possible. ______ meaning is eager, so the arrival of goods is crowded recently, and the market price is frequently seen downstream. Yesterday's market price was 0.20 to 0.30 yuan lower than last Saturday. The Tianjin gang and this street still purchased white-skinned beans, while the Nanyang route welcomed green-skinned beans. It is estimated that 1,500 bags of Jiading white-skinned broad beans were opened at a price of 6.00 yuan, 200 bags of Nanjing white-skinned small-grain beans at 5.30 yuan, and 600 bags of Maojia City Beigang green broad beans at a price of 6.50 to 6.20 yuan. 200 bags of Minhang goods were sold at 5.95 to 5.90 yuan, and 50 bags of Xiashi beans were sold at 5.80 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the change in the exchange market, the rising wind of soybeans is still continuing to jump in the cabinet, and the sales in each road are more prosperous than before because the green and yellow are not connected. Yesterday's market price rose by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan compared to the price at the end of last week. It is estimated that more than a dozen trucks of Dalian beans were traded at a price of 9.10 to 9.30 yuan, 1 truck of Xicheng beans at 9.05 yuan, 200 bags of Tianjin beans at 9.00 yuan, and 120 bags of Chongming Sha Huang at 8.57 yuan. On the 12th, 500 bags of beans were shipped to Wenzhou.</p>

<p>Therefore, the selling price is still difficult to pass down; raw oil sales are sluggish and prices are falling back.</p>
<p>Raw Oil: Yesterday's market had reported a setback, because the gold and foreign exchange market entered a stable state, so the general speculators who followed the trend also slightly converged, and the actual sales also had a full trend, so yesterday's market saw a drop of 0.50 yuan, with 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil traded at a price of 34.50 yuan (35.00 yuan was opened on Sunday), and 400 pieces of Yanhai ______ oil at 48.00 yuan, and 20 barrels of Qingdao ______ barrel oil at 47.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: The market situation also watched the environmental changes of peanut oil, but the source of the two days was reduced, and the goods in the hands of the bull company were even more squeezed, causing a shortage of chips, and the market price was still difficult to fall. The drastic rising wind has been slightly curbed. Yesterday, except for Tianjin canned oil, which rose by 1.00 to 2.00 yuan alone, all rose by 0.30 yuan, and Jiaozhou oil still opened at 31.00 yuan, with 400 pens of original plates being made. 500 cans of Tianjin listening oil were priced at 41.00 to 42.00 yuan, 300 pieces of Qingqi oil at 31.40 yuan, 350 pieces of Yanqi oil at 31.80 yuan, and 20 barrels of Dalian oil at 43.60 yuan. Also, 600 barrels of Kobe-Lian oil arrived at a price that first fell by 0.20 yuan to 42.80 yuan and then gradually rose to 43.50 yuan. It was found that 100 pieces of soybean oil came from Yantai, and 1,550 pieces were also shipped from Qingdao, it is said.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: Coming to Shanghai, pieces shipped from Yantai, 5,000 more pieces, and from Qingdao, 13,000 more pieces, and from Yantai to Shantou.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to foreign telegrams, there were no changes in the sugar market, so the trend of the local guild's drawing board was flat and soft, with a slight slack. The current spot price of 24 coarse white in the local warehouse was 0.02 yuan, which was 29.00 yuan, and the external warehouse was 0.01 yuan, which was 28.90 yuan. Transshipment goods were priced at 20.75 yuan, with 1,100 bags traded. Taikoo Che Bai (vehicle white) top-grade was more tired, falling by 0.30 yuan, B Mark was 28.70 yuan, with 100 bags traded, and CW Mark was 218.50 yuan, and CX Mark was 28.20 yuan. Lower-grade was slightly tighter due to the long distance, DY Mark was 27.50 yuan, and HX Mark was 27.30 yuan. The local cotton white was 0.05 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 28.50 yuan, No. 2 was 28.00 yuan, No. 3 was 17.00 yuan, and No. 4 was 27.00 yuan. There were more than 100 bags of ordinary Huanggang Qing, opened by the Chaozhou gang, at 14.90 yuan. The Cantonese gang raised the price of Pian Qing by several cents, but it was not successful. The Min gang Diao Qing heard that the dark market had slightly increased, with more than 200 bags traded. Yesterday, 2,780 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the cost of raw materials for coal balls has skyrocketed, and shipping has also increased water feet. Therefore, the price of each ton of coal balls from Yitai, Xingguo, and Guohua has increased by 2 yuan. The same industry's own car is 31 yuan per ton. It is 1.80 yuan per dan when it is delivered and sold separately at the gate of another shop.</p>

<h3 id="e84">In Memory of Teacher Shang Zhongyi <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Xiang</p>
<p>In the summer of 1930, a new school was founded in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province. This was the Provincial Public Education Experimental School, dedicated to creating social education talents and popularizing public education. At that time, young students from all counties in Zhejiang Province went to take the entrance exams, and I was one of the fifty-three students admitted to the Social Education Administration specialization.</p>
<p>During the short year of studying at the Public Education Experimental School, Mr. Shang Zhongyi served as the director of our school's student life guidance department. At the same time, Mr. Shang also taught courses such as educational psychology and modern culture in our department. Mr. Shang's sincere attitude and tireless teaching spirit were deeply respected and loved by all of our classmates.</p>
<p>Mr. Shang's personality and conversation revealed him to be a thorough "Northerner." He was straightforward, earnest, and selfless. His educational ideology leaned towards revolution. Mr. Shang was also a very studious educational scholar. Besides education, he was very fond of reading books on social and natural sciences. In recent years, in order to directly read progressive educational books from the Soviet Union, he worked hard to learn Russian. I heard that he achieved his goal as planned. From this, one can see a glimpse of his love for learning.</p>
<p>Mr. Shang's articles were written in a strong and simple style, without the winding, twisting, and affected tone. This precisely reflected his character. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), Mr. Shang criticized the "bird and beast language" in children's literature, sparking a famous debate. From those valuable papers, we can see the purity of his thought, the simplicity of his writing style, and a scholar's attitude that did not stray beyond the scope of academic discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Shang was a person who had done a lot of research on children's literature. When he was in the United States, he read many books on this issue and conducted a lot of research. His doctoral dissertation at Columbia University was related to children's literature. Among so many students in the school, Mr. Shang was comparatively more kind to me. This was probably because I also had a "shared interest" in children's literature! Mr. Shang's encouragement and advancement were something I could never forget.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the China Children's Education Society held its annual meeting in Shanghai. Mr. Shang went from Hangzhou to Shanghai to participate. At the meeting, he delivered a speech criticizing the "bird and beast language" in children's literature, which led to a debate with Mr. Wu Yinyin in the education column of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Since that debate, a transformation occurred in Chinese children's literature: stories with bird and beast language and fairy tales of princesses and princes gradually lost their importance and began to decline. At the same time, new types of knowledge-based, scientific, and social children's literature replaced the old types of literature (literary literature also made significant progress). I still remember that at the time of the debate, it was rare to find children's literature published in China that met his ideals. But now, there are several excellent publications in the Chinese publishing industry. (For example, Fabre's scientific stories and Ilin's works from the Soviet Union have already been translated into Chinese. In recent years, there have also been many excellent works of children's literature created by Chinese people themselves.) Although this development is partly due to the evolution of the times, I believe that it would not have transformed so quickly without that debate.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a great contribution to the development of Chinese children's literature.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), Mr. Shang took over as principal, and I had also graduated and was working at the alma mater. Therefore, I often had the opportunity to discuss the selection and writing of children's literature with Mr. Shang, which benefited me greatly. A year and a half later, I came to Shanghai to work as an editor for a children's publication, while Mr. Shang soon went to the front line of national defense in Beiping to teach.</p>
<p>Mr. Shang was a passionate patriot and an unyielding national fighter. When he arrived in Beiping, he witnessed the deteriorating local environment and the increasingly serious national crisis. He showed great sympathy and support for the students' patriotic movement, which led to his imprisonment for seventeen days.</p>
<p>Over the years, because we were both busy, our correspondence had become infrequent. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, I heard that Mr. Shang was engaged in education and mobilizing the people in the Guangdong and Guangxi areas. But who knew that today, when I opened the "International Daily News," I would discover the sad news of Mr. Shang's death in a car accident in Fengshun, Dongjiang, Guangdong!</p>
<p>In the midst of the cold wind and bitter rain, I read the memorial words on "Reality," and as I recalled my past experiences, my grief only increased infinitely.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Mr. Shang dedicated all of his energy to education. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, he led young students deep into the countryside, awakened the people, and promoted the high tide of national salvation, until he dedicated his life to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Shang has passed away. The education community has lost a progressive mentor, and the country and the nation have lost a soldier. But Mr. Shang's cause and spirit will exist forever. How should we, the surviving youths, shoulder the heavy burden that Mr. Shang has laid down and continue to fight! (Fundraising through Charity Sale)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Visit to a Rural Village in Macheng <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>——War Zone Diary——</p>
<p>Once you arrive in the war zone, nothing can be predetermined. We originally wanted to stay overnight in Songbu and then visit General Li Zongren in Huangchuan, and also inspect the mobilization of the people in the border area between Henan and Hubei provinces. Because the war has entered the second stage, the struggle unfolding in front of us is not a positional war, but a mountain war; that is to say, strategically, we must shift to a large-scale mobile warfare in order to achieve lasting and good results. The border area between Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces is an important base for the mobile network. The winding Dabie Mountains, stretching eastward from Pingjing Pass, extend all the way into Anhui, connecting with the mountains of Anhui like hands clasped together. And the towering Hong Mountains in the west are the main battlefield, especially in northern Hubei. However, after Councilor Chen's truck was arranged, things changed again; the reason was that Miss Wu in our group suddenly received an urgent letter from an old classmate from Peking University in Wuchang, saying that General Feng Zhian would be arriving in Macheng on the same day, and that some troops were waiting for orders to move into western Anhui, and that the political training office needed help, and she could go and meet with him.</p>
<p>"Then, let's go to Macheng first, shall we?" Miss Wu asked for everyone's consent.</p>
<p>After a considerable period of consideration, we finally decided to climb onto the truck under the scorching sun. The road was very narrow and very rugged, so the bumps were particularly severe. Even though it was only a few dozen miles, even our hearts were shaken.</p>
<p>Mentioning Macheng, you can't help but remember the past stories: this ancient city, overlooking western Anhui, was the fortress for advancing into the "Red Zone" in the autumn of 1931. Many bunkers still remain on the highlands outside the city. At that time, the center of the "Red Zone" was built in Jinjiazhai, which has now been changed to Lihuang County, and it has undertaken the important mission of mobile warfare. A torrent of iron from the Dabie Mountains will naturally overflow and roar, exerting its power in the same way as in the "Red Zone" era, if history can serve as a precedent.</p>
<p>It took an hour to find the headquarters, but unfortunately, General Feng had not yet arrived, and the political training office was not here either. Disappointed, we temporarily changed our plan and made visits to nearby villages. With the introduction of the Lianbao Office, we visited seven villages in a row.</p>
<p>"Why do we want to launch a war of self-defense?"</p>
<p>"To fight for independence, for freedom, for survival!"</p>
<p>"What will you do if our troops withdraw from Wuhan?"</p>
<p>"Fight a mobile war."</p>
<p>"You don't have weapons, how can you fight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, yes, they will send them! No, even hoes and rakes can fight, as long as everyone is not afraid of death!"</p>
<p>This is a test of the people's awareness of resistance, and at the same time, it is a latent great power. Their correct understanding, enthusiastic emotions, and strong unity cannot but make people marvel at the miracle and sincerely admire them.</p>
<p>"Who says victory does not belong to us?" Miss Wu's conclusion after the visit.</p>

<p>— Sang</p>
<p>The poet says: "The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of the bridal chamber, and like a hero running his course with joy. He comes out from one end of the heavens and circles to the other end, and nothing is hidden from his heat." Every time the dawn rises, the sun seems to emerge smiling from the colorful clouds. To describe him as a bride is not charming enough, but to see him as a bridegroom is just right. But when he hangs high like a fireball, it is better to say he is a warrior, or rather a martial artist. But sometimes, people have fantasies about him: why does he have to run non-stop all night? Who told him to work so hard? Why doesn't he go on strike? If one day, he is stolen by another universe, what will happen to the human race in this world? - To those who have fantasies, I respectfully present the following Bible verse: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Since the creation of the world, God's eternal power and divine nature have been clearly known. Although they are invisible to the eye, they can be understood through the things that have been created, so that people have no excuse." From this, we can know that God is the Lord of the universe. He created the sun. He is the source of human life. He not only gives the sun to sustain human material life, but He loves the world so much that He even gives His only begotten Son (Jesus) to them, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. - Shanghai Christian Literature Council, P.O.

<h3 id="e88">Germ and Anesthetic Warfare (Part 1) by J. Murray, translated by Tian Ren <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a Belgian scientist announced that germs will be used as lethal weapons in the next war. This sent chills down the spines of hundreds of millions of people and sparked heated discussions among countless experts.</p>
<p>French newspapers have reported that German chemical laboratories are working day and night to cultivate trillions of germs of various toxicities, preparing to wipe out the people of enemy countries. Many French chemists have solemnly classified these deadly germs and specified the diseases that each germ can cause. Some British scientists, although they did not believe these reports, nodded solemnly regarding the question of whether germs would be used in the next war - it is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>When the secrets of these deadly weapons that will appear in the next war have not yet been revealed, people shudder at the mention of them. Everyone hates to talk about this germ warfare that will wipe out hundreds of millions of human beings. But many European newspapers now deeply feel the mistake of neglecting this issue in the past. Because after starting to discuss this issue (although it feels a bit too late), a credible conclusion was reached, believing that the losses that germs can cause as weapons are extremely limited.</p>
<p>(1) The use of germs is extremely limited</p>
<p>Experts from Britain and France both firmly believe that the implementation of germ warfare is more restricted than the use of other weapons. Scientists from various countries know all the germs that have been discovered. Their habits and characteristics have been studied in depth and classified and recorded. Poison gas can be manufactured in the laboratory, but germs - even if new species that can wipe out human beings can be cultivated - are difficult to incubate in large quantities. Even if the military department of a certain country attempts to use known germs for combat, there are still many difficulties.</p>
<p>There are two ways to spread diseases:</p>
<p>The first method is to transmit diseases through direct contact between individuals. Therefore, if you want to spread diseases widely in an enemy country and make it surrender, you must first sacrifice countless troops of your own country, infect them with diseases, and then secretly send them to the enemy country. Using this method to attack the enemy is obviously too costly. Because even if this "medium" can complete its mission, the enemy can isolate patients and try to eliminate this epidemic.</p>
<p>The second method is to use fleas, rats, etc. as vectors to inject diseases into the enemy country. Using this method, the army must carry millions of fleas and rats. And they must be infected with pneumonic plague or bubonic plague.</p>
<p>(2) Rats cannot complete the mission</p>
<p>When I asked a Swiss chemist whether fleas and rats could be used to spread diseases to enemy countries, he told me it was impossible. Because fleas and rats have no national consciousness. Those who have experienced World War I can prove that they cannot distinguish between friend and foe. Therefore, fleas and rats spread diseases indiscriminately, which will cause infectious diseases to prevail on both sides of the front line.</p>
<p>A British bacteriologist, John Fawcett, said that the above two methods can wipe out the enemy unless the following reasons exist.</p>
<p>He said: "For every kind of disease germ, as long as it is known, it can be resisted with a serum. This serum is made from the blood of animals infected with this disease and has immunity. Therefore, when various known infectious diseases occur, or even before they occur, serum can be quickly produced in large quantities to reduce the harm of the disease.</p>
<p>"Only some bacteria whose types are unknown can truly wipe out the human race. If the germ research department of a certain country can secretly cultivate an unknown epidemic germ and produce a serum to inject into its own people, then that country can truly use this uncontrollable epidemic to destroy the enemy. However, this possibility still seems slim."</p>
<p>(3) Warfare with Anesthetic Drugs as Weapons.</p>
<p>Those experts who discuss and decide on the weapons used in the next war firmly believe that anesthetic drugs will prevail. A British writer, John Carpenetr, who specializes in the study of weapons of war, said in one of his articles that anesthetics can be used as weapons of war on a large scale, and that they are easy to use. He describes the use of anesthetics as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Russian Yacht's Encounter in Japan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>(Last October 16th, six White Russians, including Trifonov, set off from Shanghai on the yacht "Visla" to serve in the French Concession Russian Volunteer Corps, but later resigned to join this trip. Recently, someone in this city received a number of messages from Mr. T. on May 11th from the Philippines, as follows, so that adventurers who are not of British or American nationality will know that they do not enjoy this kind of convenience. If they cross the ocean by yacht or civilian ship and unfortunately land in Japan, they will inevitably suffer harsh and rude treatment. Although this kind of nationality is convenient, it is not of much use.)</p>
<p>Yacht</p>
<p>On the fourth day after departing from, it was severely damaged in a storm. Because we needed immediate repairs, we had to land on the small island of Ishigaksk (transliteration) near Taiwan. Unexpectedly, Japanese military police caught sight of us and immediately detained us, accusing us of spying for Britain and the United States. We asked them to have a passing steamboat tow the yacht into the port, but they ignored us. We showed them the manuscript published in the newspaper about the yacht departing from , but it was also ineffective. They retorted that it was absurd for us to have traveled six hundred in four days.</p>
<p>During the four months we were detained, it was as if we were in hell. I tried to write down the details of the torture my companions suffered, but the pen almost fell from my fingers. Since the six of us were detained, the yacht with its valuable equipment was left unattended, allowing vendors to seize everything on board. Later we learned that the police were also using this to enrich themselves, and our canned goods and all the cooking utensils disappeared.</p>
<p>Military Police</p>
<p>Forced us to exchange all our US dollars for their Japanese yen, exchanging one US dollar for only two Japanese yen. Soon our funds ran out, so the police unhesitatingly disposed of our best items, until nothing was left. Clothes, shoes, watches, were all taken by the police chief, giving us one to three Japanese yen for each item. One time, during a storm, the police "borrowed" our raincoats, but not a single one was ever seen again. To the extreme, the police also came to bother with the money obtained from the "auction" of our luggage, and began to "borrow" it. The most unbearable was a certain Mr. Tong, who was despicable, cunning, and ruthless interpreter.</p>
<p>During two months, we were subjected to thorough interrogations. Each time, we received one or two slaps and punches on the face. Later, the police station decided to send us to the port of Nacha (transliteration) on a large island near Japan, where we were placed in the same cell with Japanese prisoners. The Japanese police there were more polite and compassionate. The Japanese prisoners seemed to have committed the crime of being infected with Bolshevism. They were taken out one by one, day and night. We could faintly hear shouts. It turned out that they were being interrogated. When the night guards were asleep, the Japanese prisoners blew the Internationale, and the sound echoed throughout.</p>
<p>Detention</p>
<p>After four months, the authorities were unwilling to feed us any longer, because we had become a burden to them. At this time, we had lost all our luggage, and there was nothing in our pockets. We had no choice but to sell the yacht, but who would buy it? The ship had collided with a rock and had been unattended for four months. The propeller was damaged and the motor was completely out of order, so selling it was impossible, and we could not move.</p>
<p>We were only allowed to write letters a week before we left Japan. One of our companions, a Polish man, reported his plight to the Polish consul in Tokyo, begging for help. When writing the letter, it was under the supervision of the Japanese military police, and the contents of the letter were closely scrutinized. The soldiers explained that our "lodging" fees and all other expenses were paid by the Japanese government, and that we would have to repay the money when we received the money from the Polish consulate.</p>
<p>Before long, the Polish consul sent a reply, saying that the required funds would be sent immediately. Upon learning this, the Japanese authorities fined me 300 Japanese yen, on the grounds that our yacht had entered the pig zone without permission. At the same time, they learned that three of our companions were making a living by performing, so they ordered the three to perform at a certain theater. We performed for several days and earned a total of hundred Japanese yen, which was 15% of the gross revenue, but on the day of payment, after the settlement, we not only had no money left, but owed the theater twenty-nine yen. This shows that the longer we worked hard, the more we owed. The longer we worked hard, the more we owed. Our meals were set at two yuan per day. With this money, we could only buy sweet potato flour and some fat. We were very unhappy because we couldn't get cigarettes.</p>
<p>Theater</p>
<p>The life resulted in us losing the rest of our clothes and other items. The Polish Ambassador, upon learning of our plight, lodged a complaint with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry assured him that the lost items would be found and returned. When we returned to the yacht, we saw that only two barrels of the original five barrels of clean water remained. The rest, such as plates, platters, and the entire set of cooking utensils, as well as the souvenir album of photos, were all gone.</p>
<p>The condition of the yacht was truly deplorable. There were holes everywhere, and the motor and propeller were damaged. It cost 70 Japanese yen to get it "repaired", but that wasn't a complete repair, just enough to get it away from the Japanese "paradise".</p>
<p>Now we have arrived in the Philippines and are preparing to go to Australia. After living in Japan, we feel even more that the Filipinos are polite and friendly. Our experience of living with the Japanese will remain in our minds as a terrible nightmare! (Translated from Miller's Review)</p>

<p>— Ren Mingfa</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to promote showing movies in refugee camps, because the compatriots in refugee camps are all excessively stimulated and have lost their true nature. How are we to reduce their mental distress, eliminate their spiritual pain, increase their belief in the War of Resistance, supplement their inadequate thoughts, dispel the impure minds of a few, and make them understand the country's position today?</p>
<p>I have seen four movies in a refugee camp, which I briefly write down below:</p>
<p>(1) A slapstick comedy: depicting a person's madness after being drunk, making discordant jokes, delaying important matters, and destroying the family. Making the bitter faces of the refugees reveal smiles.</p>
<p>(2) A hygiene film: explaining a person's entire bone marrow and the process of blood circulation. At the same time, it indicates the disadvantages of drastic exercise and no exercise. And common bleeding prevention methods.</p>
<p>(3) A cartoon: The content is that many Mickey Mice, unable to withstand the oppression of the old cat, in an environment where they can no longer bear it, suddenly rise up, connect the Mickey Mice in the north and south, and finally kill the old cat.</p>
<p>(4) A production film: In a certain place in the United States, there are many people who, every spring, put fish eggs into the sea. After a appropriate time, the eggs placed in the sea all become very big fish. The eggs from the captured fish are prepared in the same way as before. As for the fish, they are all made using scientific methods, put into cans, and sold in the market. The efficiency of such production is so amazing!</p>
<p>The above four films are shown in front of the public, teaching us that we must unite to achieve victory. To produce, to be able to live. As well as, the common sense that everyone must know.</p>

<p>— A New Dream</p>
<p>Promoting Women's Professions, Training Service Talents</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Education Center is an organization dedicated to women's education. It is located at 54 Hualong Road, not far from the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and close to the French Park.</p>
<p>In a metropolis like Shanghai, there are at least a million women, but there are too few groups and organizations engaged in women's education. The Shanghai Women's Education Center can be considered an organization striving for women's education and is worthy of our introduction.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the work of the Women's Education Center is extensive. In addition to holding lectures or exhibitions of women's calligraphy, paintings, and other works, the most important work is promoting women's continuing education. The Women's Vocational Supplementary School they have established offers many subjects: such as Chinese, English, Arithmetic, Embroidery, Bookkeeping, Typing, Piano, Abacus, Conversation, Sewing, etc., all related to women's vocational education. Many women now take advantage of their spare time to take various supplementary courses.</p>
<p>The Women's Education Center not only has a Women's Vocational Supplementary School but also a Service Personnel Training Class. Based on the principle of combining teaching and practice, it trains women to become educational service talents through practical work. The center is currently in its seventh recruitment period. Any unmarried woman aged 16 to 25 who is healthy in body and mind and willing to serve in women's education for life can apply for the exam.</p>
<p>The training period varies depending on the individual's educational background: Junior high school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications train for three years; senior high school students who have studied for more than one and a half years train for two years; high school graduates train for one year; and university students who have studied for more than half a year train for six months. Tuition, board, and lodging are completely free during the training period, and students with good grades may also receive stipends and bonuses. Upon completion of training, the starting salary is at least 35 yuan per month, with free board and lodging, and the salary will be increased annually based on service performance.</p>
<p>The first recruitment examination this year will be held on May 21, and the second on June 18. The subjects of the examination are divided into two parts: Chinese, English, Arithmetic, and Party Knowledge are the first test; Speech, Conversation, and Physical Examination are the second test. Once admitted, students can enter the center on the specified date. However, those whose performance is excessively poor and deemed unsuited for training will be asked to withdraw from the school.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Beautiful Women Avenge Enemies but Cannot Eliminate Karma; Loving Talks in Green Windows Renew Good Bonds</p>
<p>It turned out that Zhao Letian was injured in the night raid. Rumors spread, saying that Zhao Letian had gloriously sacrificed himself for the country. In particular, the enemy newspapers did not mention that their baggage train had been captured or that their officers and soldiers had been annihilated. Instead, they only said that a guerrilla unit had been wiped out and that their leader, Zhao Letian, had been killed in action. When Pan Peiying's father saw this news report, he was very pleased and showed the newspaper to his daughter. He thought that if he only heard the news and told his daughter, she might not believe it, thinking that he had fabricated it to break her attachment. But now the newspaper reported the news, which was a verifiable fact, published not only in newspapers in the occupied area but also in newspapers in the old Shanghai. It said that Zhao Letian was loyal and courageous in saving the country, and gloriously sacrificed himself. He was truly a young man with aspirations, and there was no mistake about it. When he showed the newspaper to his daughter, he also rambled on with many unpleasant words. He said, "I knew that this kid would not have a good death. Fighting is for soldiers; what do you students want to do? You were all incited by the Communist Party. The Communist Party has no men or women; they all come out to be soldiers. They call them the Red Army. Now that he is dead, it is all clean, otherwise, he might have implicated others in the future. Guerrilla units are all new tricks invented by the Communist Party to deceive the villagers. That's why I didn't allow you to associate with him before. Later, he even had the nerve to write to you. Fortunately, I refused to let you communicate with him. I knew he wouldn't have a good ending. Now you should understand, right?" Pan Peiying's father thought he was enlightening his daughter, and he also wanted to cut off his daughter's heart so that he could have other plans in the future. Who knew that when Pan Peiying heard the news, her heart was like a knife. She thought, "It's over! Everything is over! I listened to my father's words before, and I was under his pressure. It was all a temporary measure. I was afraid that Zhao Letian would be harmed by them. I expected that there would always be a day when we could meet. I could explain it to him slowly. As long as I said a few words to him, he would believe me. So even if my family was under strict surveillance, I would endure it for the time being because I hoped that this situation would not last long. We are all young, and there will always be a day when we can meet. I didn't expect that he would sacrifice himself for the country. He received the letter I rejected him at that time. Don't think that I really rejected him. We didn't have the opportunity to explain, and he never wrote back. How sad it is to drink with hatred and never look back!" (135)</p>

<h3 id="e96">Movie Star Mr. and Mrs. Hickman Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday on World Tour <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Two Female Students Present Bracelets to Express Welcome; Mrs. Liu Invites Them to Eat Chinese Food</p>
<p>Gloria Stuart, the blonde movie star of 20th Century Fox, and her husband, the famous screenwriter A. Sheekmen, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM aboard the Russian Empress on a world tour. They will sightsee here for a week, then take a boat to Hong Kong, stay there for about a week, and then travel to Europe via Saigon and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>The first to welcome Ms. Stuart were the "representatives" of Shanghai movie fans — two young Western female students. They and a reporter from the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post went to the Hua Liu Mao Hotel early in the morning when Ms. Stuart had just arrived in Shanghai to meet the actress. The two female students shyly took off their vermilion bracelets, their faces flushed, and presented them to Ms. Stuart, welcoming her to sightsee here happily. Ms. Stuart felt unworthy of the gift and wrote down the names and addresses of the two fans, promising to send them photos.</p>
<p>Mr. Hickman and his wife have not yet decided on a detailed travel plan in Shanghai. Their first social engagement was an invitation from Mrs. Liu, the author of a cookbook called "The Way Chinese Eat," to have lunch with the Hickmans to taste the authentic flavors of Chinese cuisine. Ms. Stuart and her husband gladly accepted Mrs. Liu's invitation. The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post has also asked Mr. and Mrs. Hickman to visit the war-torn sites in Zhabei in the afternoons of the next few days to commemorate the dead.</p>
<p>Ms. Stuart is clearly concerned about Shanghai's nightlife. She said, "I have heard a lot about the entertainment venues in this 'Paris of the East.' Before leaving Shanghai, I want to visit various entertainment venues and nightclubs, but I don't want to buy too many things in Shanghai."</p>
<p>The blonde movie star and Mrs. Karen of the Shanghai Associated Press are friends. She wanted to visit Shanghai two years ago, but she was tied down by the duties of the film company, so she did not make it until now.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Answers a Few Questions Regarding "An Outline of the Erhu" <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Since "An Outline of the Erhu" was published in this journal, I have been asked many questions, and it seems that I should provide further explanations. However, someone asked: What is "counterpoint"? That is a term in Western music. If you want to know more details, you can read specialized books on counterpoint. (For example, there is a book on counterpoint music published by the Zhonghua Book Company.) It is not convenient to discuss it here because of the limited space, and I am not a specialist in Western music. Someone else asked: What is "outward push and inward pull"? This is also difficult to explain. It is a difficult bowing technique that is very difficult to master. It was invented by Mr. Wang Shaoqing, and he did not give it a name. The so-called "outward push and inward pull" is a term I coined. It is not necessary to learn it. I have no way to teach people in writing, and I am really sorry.</p>
<p>Someone said that the skills of the erhu are important, but what about the ideas? This is easy to explain: technique (tangible) is the performance of thought (intangible). Therefore, perfect thought must be performed with perfect technique. If you only have technique, but your thoughts are not high, then there is no value. If you only have thought, but no technique, then you cannot achieve good results. For example, Sun Zuochen's erhu is a case of technique exceeding thought. My teacher, Mr. Chen Dao'an, was a case of thought exceeding technique. Therefore, Mr. Chen often taught me things that I could not apply. (He himself could not apply them). In the end, because his thoughts were too high, many problems occurred in his technique, and he could not perform. What Mr. Wang Shaoqing taught me was also impossible to apply because my technique was not good enough. It was too far off — I couldn't perform. Although I worked very hard to practice, I couldn't reach that level of spirit. If you compare it, his hand seemed to have a machine in it, and the sound was lively and agile, while I am a withered and yellow weed.</p>
<p>Someone also asked me if I have any records? Then I will tell you that the Pathé Records of the Baidai Company has Guo Xiaoqing's "Female Escort," and I played the erhu for that. Technically, I feel that I am better than before. In the interlude below "Difficult to Defend Injustice," I used a down-bow because I was slowly going up, and the erhu went directly to the high notes, so it was not pleasant to listen to. The drummer was also a little flustered. I also used a down-bow on the third side. The erhu followed the playing, but I used a down-bow on my erhu, and some of the notes were different between the two of us. Some people listened to it very satisfied. It is a pity that the erhu was a little too slow. This is the score and playing method that I compiled myself. The changes in the upper and lower bows are also not very easy, but in a short period of time, this achievement can be considered passable.</p>
<p>I may start compiling erhu lecture notes, but it does not seem necessary at the moment, and the collection of photos and other materials is not complete. Another thing is that I have been suffering from chest pain recently, and I am afraid that I may not be able to produce a perfect product. It seems that it is not right to deceive people with shoddy products.</p>
<h3 id="e99">After Watching "The Hypocrite" <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Second Week Performance of the New Drama Society</p>
<p>After watching the New Drama Society's "Our Belief," it is enough to see that they have a belief and determination for the drama movement.</p>
<p>Under the constraints of environment and financial resources, the New Drama Society has established its roots in a short period of time. On the 11th, the drama society performed Molière's "The Hypocrite" at the Carlton Grand Theatre for the second week. The theme of this drama is the most quintessential depiction of social reality. Although the plot is not very complicated, the effect of its performance can capture the hearts of the audience.</p>
<p>Now let's examine the story of "The Hypocrite": Bai Xuegang's most trusted friend, Dai Duofu, is outwardly a very reserved person who is usually full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality. However, almost no one in the Bai family hates him because they know Dai Duofu's hypocrisy, and Dai Duofu is a cunning and treacherous person. In order to achieve the purpose of marrying Bai Xuegang's daughter, Mary, he does not hesitate to destroy Mary's marriage with Yang Weiru. He also teases Bai's wife, Ai Mi, but is seen by Bai's son, Dali, who exposes his hypocrisy on the spot. However, Bai Xuegang not only does not understand Dai Duofu's hypocrisy but instead condemns his family and gives Dai Duofu the right to inherit the property. As a result, Dai Duofu becomes even more powerful in the Bai family and uses all his cunning to seize the Bai family's rights. Until Bai Xuegang discovers that he is teasing his wife, he is furious and wants to drive him out. Unfortunately, all the property deeds of the Bai family fall into Dai's hands. He finally becomes ashamed and angry and wants to drive the entire Bai family away. In the end, Dai Duofu brings the section chief and police officers from the Public Security Bureau, but to his surprise, the authorities have already understood the truth, and the result is that Dai Duofu is sentenced to prison.</p>
<p>Although this is a simple chapter, the structure is very tight. And the characters in this drama are just as Ibsen said: "Each character must be real, vivid; each character must be valuable, not meaningless."</p>
<p>Zhou Qi, who plays "The Hypocrite," is a success. His deep expressions can indeed fit the character in the play everywhere. I remember many days ago, his performances in Xiaofeng Drama Troupe's "Flood" and "Wu Zetian" had already won the support of many audiences, and this time he is even more satisfying to people. Chen Qi, who plays Mary, and Yan Hua, who plays Yang Weiru, are a pair of lovers. When they are in an embarrassing situation, the atmosphere of comedy is so strong. Cai Jin, who plays the maid, is eloquent and completely portrays the identity of the character in the play. Zhang Wan, who plays Mrs. Bai, is even more praised for her demeanor. The rest of the actors are also very hardworking and serious, and even the stage setting is satisfactory.</p>
<p>I hope that the New Drama Society will make greater progress in future performances.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Yan Youxiang Suddenly Goes to Hong Kong <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— (Yinshui)</p>
<p>Hiring Li Qinian; Seeking Zhang Cuihong</p>
<p>In the past few days, the newspapers have been very nervous about the issue of the protagonist of Yihua's "Wang Baochuan." In particular, they have been disappointed and regrettable that Zhang Cuihong refused to play Wang Baochuan. It seems that Zhang Cuihong must be a fairy descending from heaven.</p>
<p>Today, another news suddenly came that Yan Youxiang, the manager of Yihua, has already set off for Hong Kong. It is said that it has something to do with Wang Baochuan. According to general speculation, in addition to distribution matters, there are the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Chasing Zhang Cuihong, because Zhang Cuihong wanted to avoid Yihua's invitation and has gone to Hong Kong, Yan's trip also shows that he is not discouraged.</p>
<p>(2) Hiring the Guangdong star Li Qinian to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) There are many former Shanghai filmmakers concentrated in Hong Kong, hoping to invite one or two to come.</p>
<p>The above three points seem to be more reliable in the latter two points. If Yan's trip to Hong Kong is really to chase Zhang Cuihong, this is a very exciting thing, then there will definitely be very funny materials in the Hong Kong newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Anecdotes of the Pear Garden <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Biggest Reason Why Yu Shuyan Doesn't Want to Perform</p>
<p>There are already few operas co-performed by old men and clowns, and "Tian Lei Bao," "Qing Xiang Zhu," and "Qiong Lin Banquet" cannot be as good as the old partners. In fact, except for Chang Lin, who sometimes played the role of a postman in "Chu Xiang" with Shuyan, Shuyan has never partnered with him in other operas. Therefore, if Yu intends to perform again, the first important thing is to find a famous clown who can follow the rules and act accurately, so that he dares to sing for a long time. If he is taught to casually find a few supporting actors, I think he will never be so hasty in order to take care of his past reputation.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another biggest reason that always prevents him from performing, that is, his economy is too abundant. It is said that he can take in two or three thousand yuan of interest every month. His family has a very simple population. Besides his wife and two daughters, there are no others. The living standard in Peiping is also low, and no matter how much they spend, they will never spend five or six hundred yuan. The family property is more than one year old with interest on interest. He has no sons himself, and he earns hundreds of thousands more, which is ultimately cheaper for people of different surnames. Therefore, he does not have to seek his own troubles if he can find an excuse not to sing. In the past, Qing Daoren criticized Da Heshan's calligraphy and painting, saying: Shanren's calligraphy and painting are both exquisite, but they are not sold unless they are poor. It can be seen that all artists should not be too rich. Shuyan is only fifty years old, which is the age when Lao Tan became famous. At this time, the fire is just right, but it is good to contribute what he has learned in his old age to the society, but he returns to the old capital and does not allow his unique skills to be seen by the world. This is not only the misfortune of the opera fans, but also a great loss to the younger generation of actors, who have no chance to see his art and learn from it for reference, and follow it for guidance.

<h3 id="e103">Secret News from the Pear Garden of the Old Capital <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Xin Yanqiu, the famous female Kunqu performer who was once rumored to have died in Shanghai, arrived in Ping from Tianjin this spring. She originally prepared to form a troupe in Ping to perform, but her mother's attitude was firm and strongly opposed her reappearance on the red stage. Xin Ling has always obeyed her mother's orders, so she was discouraged and no longer wanted to perform on stage. A few days ago, she secretly left Ping for Tianjin, and temporarily lived in her sister's residence. Her house in Ping has also been rented out. The outside world knows very little about the matter. This proves that Xin Ling really has the determination to take off her opera costume?</p>
<p>Kunqu old man Ma Yunqiao, who has been performing in other places, is very popular because of his round and bright voice. After coming to Ping a month ago, he once performed at Guangdelou. Xu Lanyuan, a famous qin player, regarded him as a promising talent, and then turned to Wan Chi Zijun for help, and entered the door of Bao Guxiang, and became sisters with Meng Xiaodong, the chief of Kunqu old man. Every day, in addition to Bao Jixiang's guidance, he also gets Xiaodong's help, and his artistic career is advancing rapidly. Recently, someone is forming a troupe for Yunqiao's public performance, which will be realized soon</p>
<p>Famous Jing Jin Shaoshan's voice once lost its luster a few years ago. After a doctor carefully diagnosed and treated him, he has now recovered, but he has not yet performed on stage. The reason is said to be the sale of cloth and economic problems, so he cannot perform for a while. According to another message, Jin will soon perform in a good play hosted by the National Art Revitalization Association. The news is divergent and still needs to be confirmed</p>
<p>Wu Sheng Zhang Yunxi, who was rising up, injured his leg in the east of the province. The outside world said that the injury was quite serious and that he might be disabled. However, according to Yunxi's follower, Yunxi's fall only caused an old injury and only needed to be recuperated. Also, Zhang Xiaojie, Yunxi's follower, had been brewing cooperation with Li Shaochun, but he was persuaded by others and will still cooperate with Yunxi. From this point of view, Yunxi will recover soon.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Chinese Residents in India <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In the city of Le La Jia, the capital of India, there are 570 Chinese people who live and marry among themselves, not interacting with the natives. They all make a living by making boots and raising pigs, forming a class of their own. As for when they came here, they claim to have been here for over ninety years. A wealthy merchant from Guangdong, when the local officials coveted his wealth, often used excuses to extort him. The wealthy merchant, fearing that his assets would be completely lost, made a plan to escape. He bought and built a foreign ship, converted all his assets and belongings into gold and silver, loaded them into the ship, and gathered four or five hundred men and women from his relatives and employees to set sail and entrust themselves to India, in the spirit of the Bearded Guest fleeing to Fuyu. It has been nearly a hundred years since then, and they have been marrying each other. Their offspring are not very numerous, but they live and work in peace.</p>

<p>The road from Hongkou to Baoshan is leased by the Public Works Department at a price in perpetuity, to be used as public land. Recently, there have been rumors that a railway line will be built, and even the Taoist officials have inquired about this. Railways cannot be built without the approval of the Prime Minister's Office. After investigation, it was learned that a road is to be opened to facilitate the passage of vehicles and horses.</p>

<p>The boats docked at Touting, Lingbai, and Langgan in Jianggan, Hangzhou, are collectively known as Jiangshan, and also called the Nine-Surname Fishing Boats. Some say that they are descendants of the generals of Chen Youliang, so they do not associate with the common people and entrust themselves to the flower trade. Recently, the magistrate, because the provincial examinations are approaching, and there have been malpractices such as hooligans making trouble, issued a strict ban, prohibiting them from docking in front of the Butterfly Silk Wharf Boat Bureau, and ordering them to move far away. Alas! Those who entrust themselves to the hibiscus and the phoenix, and those who are driven away. The boundless scenery of the past has now become fleeting clouds. Those who come to Hangzhou to study for the examinations, who will re-order the record of Banqiao, and trace the tracks of the pines and cypresses in Xiling?</p>
