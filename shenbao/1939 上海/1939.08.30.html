<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國之遠東政策</h3>
<p>中國駐英大使郭泰祺氏昨在倫敦，訪晤英國外相哈立法克斯氏；晤談情狀，未經公表。據傳：英外相向郭大使提供保證，略稱歐局縱使劇變，英國遠東政策決不改變云。其言其行，俱待證實、竊以爲可信也。</p>
<p>五六日來，國際之一般氣象，承蘇德兩國突然簽訂互不侵犯條的之後，倍見陰森黯淡，紊亂動搖。誠以國家之感受蘇德條的直接影響者、利害所繫，亟應有所作爲，務期適應新局勢；凡百紛更，動費周章，事非得已，理宜若是也。亦有爲感情所驅，奔突叫囂，而不遑悉中事理者；亦有爲一時之變態所囿，患得患失，而類乎饑不擇食者；察之各方之宣傳，弱點畢見；於是表面之紊亂動搖，視實際之演變爲愈烈。英外相昨日所作保證，有使國際一部分之紊亂動搖，趨於澄淸穩定之功效，是足稱也。</p>
<p>夫國際何以形成今日之氣象？其因果功罪，非止一端；或以咎英國，其實英國豈眞獨任其咎；然英國遭遇最艱窘，此則應爲人人所共認也。彼在歐洲爲德國之怨府府，在遠東爲日本所排擠；强硬則惟恐觸發戰爭而犧牲過鉅，屈服則惟失墜國勢而瀕於危亡；聯絡美國則輒爲美國之孤立主義所祟，結歡蘇聯則卒爲蘇聯之孤立政策所絕；及至今日，惟有嚴陣以窺希特勒氏之喜怒而已。雖然，英國朝野意念之齊一而堅定，始亦無逾於今日者。當彼欲强硬而不敢，欲屈服而不能之際，徘徊歧途，進腿皆非，惟企圖僥倖兩全，惟企圖蹊徑可循；今則和戰雖待決於德國，然實逼處此，登臨最後關頭，更不容復作他想矣。戰則一聲動員，義無返顧；不戰則共謀各種糾紛之總解決，非英國一國事也。當彼追求於莫斯科之日，遷延不決而希望無窮；惟多希望，故意念亦未免於雜駁不純；抑且與主義政策以及民族素質國家機構絕不相侔之蘇聯，相期以捐棄現實之矛盾，破除傳統之隔閡，是誠無異於同時並嘗甜酸苦辣，旣不免面生可疑，又不免受寵若驚。而今茲蘇德之簽訂互不侵犯條的，在蘇德爲完成率直之創作，在國際爲掃除離奇之烟慕；在英國似逢意外奇變，實則因是而得體認眞面目，是亦可珍之收穫，英人不謂無得也。</p>
<p>今日之英國，，經紆迥而還原，經磨折而堅定，必自此收拾幻想，不作他想。蓋保全國勢保全權益，並無捷徑，亦無可假借於國際。國際相處，親親疎疎，必有所本，非事急相隨，可以苟合。合不合視國策，視需要；各國各有其國策，求變更他國之國策以適合本國之需要，而乞靈於外交，終必失敗；需要相合，甯若尊重他國國策。以此檢討英國之遠東政策，則有三端焉，允必爲今日之英國所能大徹大悟者：以中國之崇尚信義，以中英之利害相共，則中國旣以抗戰爲應付侵略之唯一方法，中國旣以爭持主權領土之完整爲抗戰之唯一目標，則英國自應確認其意義而盡其所能，惟力是視、此其一也？英國在遠東所受之排擠，根本由於現狀與野心之利害矛盾，非因國際之煽動，非因主義之枘鑿，亦非於利害之外有何友敵恩怨；今日國際情况之變化，旣不足以融和根本之矛盾，亦未見其能消滅對方之野心，則英國在遠東所受國際變化之影響者，至多爲所受排擠今後有緩急隱顯之殊而已，非得不受排擠也，此其二也。</p>
<p>美國在國際，有其固定之國策，對華對英對德對日，各有必然之態度與分際；然所以推行其國策者，將以情勢而異其效率；或以爲美國同情於英法，故將爲英法拉攏遠東之日本，此則端視英法之遠東政策適合美國國策吾耳；或以爲英法拉攏日本則可以抵銷蘇聯之變卦，其實英法在遠東之行動若與美國國策相牴牾，則拉攏日本亦可以抵銷美國之同情，此其三也。凡此三端，英國當局必所熟察，是以彼外相哈立法克斯氏所坦然爲郭大使言之者，宜非虛語也。</p>
<p>（東京）阿部大將今日午後分別走訪町田·中島·久原等各氏後、於下午三時三十分在虎門霞山會館招致組閣參謀遠藤柳作·橫山助成·庚澤俊樹等三、商討積極進行組閣事、關於新閣僚全部要員之決定須於卅日上午完成手續、並擬定於同日午後在宮中舉行各閣僚就任式、（廿九日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）據今晚所發消息、日本阿部內閣之人選、最早須明日正式發表、名單大致如下、</p>
<p>相阿部大將、外相內定重光、在重光未回國前、由阿部暫兼、內相小原直（岡田內閣時之法相、）藏相靑木一男陸相畑俊六、海相吉田善吾、法相宮城長五郞、文相河原田稼、（林權助內閣時代之內相）商相兼農相伍堂卓雄、遞信大臣永井柳太郞、（齋藤內閣時代之拓相、）拓相金光庸夫（衆院副議長）（九日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本政友會之大口善六、決定加入新內閣、（二十九日同盟電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國外相哈里法克斯昨日向中國駐英大使郭泰祺保證、英國遠東政策、不因歐洲糾粉、或蘇德簽訂不侵犯公的、而稍改變、據稱、郭氏曾向哈里法克斯外相、說明過去二年來、中國在遠東所努力者與英國企圖在歐洲所爲者無異、雙方目標、均爲與侵略者戰爭、此間觀察家相信、中國政府恐日本因蘇德簽訂互不侵犯公的後、外交方面趨於孤立、英國或犧牲中國、與日本在遠東覓取諒解、當郭氏往英外務部時、與日本駐英大使重光葵在英外相辦公室外候客室相値、雙方各不招呼、哈里法克斯外相、分別接見中日兩國大使、重光葵訪英外相宗旨未曾宣布、然衆信渠係探詢歐洲局勢最近發展情形、並通知英外相以日本內閣改組事、（二十九日美聯電）</p>
<h3>英美人士觀察　日本政局</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日評論日內閣辭職事、謂日本當有若干理由自覺爲人愚弄、許多日人定早知西特勒在機會適宜於已時將背棄日本之可能性、然日本無人料及若是之驟也、未獲早一日之警告、遽遭拋棄、而受惠者適爲其主要敵國、如此命運誠非可歡迎、德外長里賓特羅甫言及莫斯科時而發之輕蔑的暗示、及其所稱日德關係可更臻親密之言論、大足證明德國不獨待遇日本毫無禮貌、且視日本爲第五等國之不愉快的眞相、此誠可痛心者、但除尊榮受侮外、日本無甚損失、而反獲極有價値之敎訓、今後可自由規劃其自己之前途、然其前途旣無歐洲方面之主義上任何聯絡復有充分之糾纏、縱使歐局澄淸、當新相阿部亦將有不少煩惱、惟有一事爲阿部所瞭然者、即英日關係對於日本頗關重要、日本新政府尚知在英國方面未有出人意外的舉動。含混不定的態度。及兩重的折術也、英國遠東政策之目的、今猶是中日戰爭初起時之目的、英國願對日本有良好之關係、與英國對他國如中國等所有者同、英國願欣然覩中國和平之恢復、但此必須爲公正之和平、英國要求其在華利益之受人尊重、並凖備保障之、綜之、英日關係之任何改善、乃對於和平之供獻、如英國簡單而堅定的原則爲日方所了解、則英國遠東政策未有可阻止此種改善實現之處也云、（廿日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院官員對於新內閣、在其人選與政策未完全明瞭之前、不願有所批評、惟據此間熟悉時事者言、日本此次內閣之更迭、由於日本內部輿論之轉變、蓋日本人士多認蘇德不侵條的之簽訂、確已危及日本之安全、惟有人以爲日本今後在國際方面之活動、尚難預測、惟就大體言、日本今後對於英美、將和緩其敵對之態度、蓋無論就軍事上言與在商業上言、此種態度之改變、乃極爲合理者、因其採取此種態度之後、假若歐洲犬戰不爆發、則日本在遠東之地位、即不致十分不利、假若歐戰爆發、則日本當然可以多做些生意、不致遭民主國之忌憚、另有一政治批評家名勞倫期者、主張美國利用日本爲德國擯棄之機會、恢復美日間之友好關係、其意日本須接受九國公約為解決遠東問題之基礎、中国之土地完整、必須加以保持、但日本在華之勢力區域與經濟機會、亦須爲相當之承認、美日關係調整之後、美國之艦隊、即可移調一部至大西洋、爲民主國助威矣、（二十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本閣潮極為國務院所注意、副國條卿威爾斯會與駐日大使格魯（現在美國休假）進行談話、英國駐美大使林德賽旋亦訪問威爾斯副卿、除磋商歐洲時局而外、並會討論日本政局情形、（林德賽大使定於本月三十日返英）此間接近國務院人十頃謂、德辦爾國互不侵犯條約成立之後、業以最嚴重的影響加諸日本、該國茲或組成溫和內閣、而與英法兩國有接近之可能、至以美國而論、日本若果組成溫和內閣、而願在遠東恢復均勢、則美國所處地們、實甚良好、美日兩國所可討論之問題不一而足、除締結新商約而外、「滿洲國」問題或亦可研究及乙、查日本現在中國所行政策、與美國遠東政策所根據之門戶開放原則、完全牴觸、茲者日本倘原油改弦易轍、而設法與美國接近、則美國政府或將為「忠實的居間人」、為日本與英法兩國設法拉攏、此舉雖屬假想的、他日結果如何、亦難逆覩、但國務院某某人士、仍希望日本態度超于溫和、并謂日本倘與英法兩國携手合作、即足以抵銷蘇聯在歐洲改變態度之影響云、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（重慶）　軍政部長何應欽昨晨在中樞紀念週報告最近三個月軍事概况、略謂、最近三個月來、除了晋東南的戰鬥以及豫南明港一帶的戰鬥而外、各方沒有很激烈的戰鬥、其他比較重大的戰况、就是日軍在潮汕登陸、和珠江口寳安附近登陸、與中英邊界深圳之戰鬥、（一）晋東南戰鬥、華北日人、企圖肅淸我據晋南山地中的部隊、曾在五月中竭其全力、八次進攻晋南中條山、經我軍奮勇反攻、截至六月中旬、將進攻日人、全部擊潰、六月十五日我軍克復□□以後、日乃變更計劃、集中晋南晋中幷平漢錢及道淸路各部隊、分五路進攻太行山、其主要目標在希攻晋城、因晋城是晋東南一個極重要的據點、在七月、陽城·沁水·長·遼·均有激烈戰鬥、最後雖晋城被佔、但我軍叉將陽城·沁水·長子·遼縣·沁源·各城相繼克復、時時斷其速絡、日因背後受我威脅、於是除以第某某師團之主力固守晋城·以某某某師團之一部固守長治外、其餘各師團均調回原地、我軍積極分途反攻、並到處截擊其外圍交通、遂於八月二十日克復晋城、十三日克復高平、現正向各路追擊、日在晋東南之企圖、至此完全打破、（二）潮汕方面日軍登陸之戰門經過、六月下旬、日由粵抽調部隊、並以海軍空軍之掩護、在汕頭登陸、我守軍猛力抵抗、但因配在該處之兵力較薄、汕頭遂陷、我軍照預定計劃撤至潮安西北山地、日之進攻潮汕、目的在封鎖我華南海口、我方一部份之商業經濟、雖不免略受影響、並無多大關係、（三）豫南明港一帶之戰鬥、豫南鄂北的日人、自五月中隨棗會戰失敗以後、久已潛伏不動、七月中晋省日人正實行五路進攻太行山之際、豫南信陽長台關地帶之日人、亦集結步騎兵萬餘、分向西北兩方竄擾、其目的在牽制我黃河南岸之各路、以策應其晋中的進擊、於是乃有明港一帶的戰鬥、七月二十四日進陷明港一十五陷平昌後、並分兵進犯沁陽桐柏、其一部北擾確山、經我沁陽桐柏確山各方面截擊、遂告頓挫、旋我軍行有計劃的反攻、八月三日將明港以北的日人肅淸、日向南潰退、明港克復、（四）珠江口寳安附近日軍登陸與深圳附近之戰鬥、當日英東京談判停頓的第三天上午一時、日千餘人突在珠江口寳安南方的南頭地方登陸、並即向深圳及九龍邊界前進、於十八日下午陷深圳、日人在中英邊界登陸目的、在威脅英國、欲使東京談判易於就範、並作可能封鎖香港之形勢、對於華方軍事、殊無影響、至於近三月來我們所獲戰果、每月月終都已由負責機關公布、載在報端、不再贅述、我們就三個月來情形、回顧兩年來抗戰經過、對日人情形、可以得一總括觀察、（一）就軍事方面說、日人戰鬥力、確已一天比一天薄弱、尤其在武漢會戰以後、日人攻擊力、已遠不如前、如隨棗之役、中條山太行山各役、不惟不能達其預相企圖、而且還遭受很大損失、原因很簡單、第一是日人經長期作戰、精銳巳損失大半、補充兵員、大多是後備兵、精神與敎育自然差得很遠、第二是戰綫的延長、我戰區的擴大、日人在每一個地方、都要支配若干兵力、無法活動、第三便是軍心的渙散、侵華戰事、經過兩年、不僅日木的人民，巳深知中國人民之不可征服、因而醞釀反戰、即日人下級官和士兵、也發生厭棄的心理、進而發生反戰的行爲、（二）外交方面、日人行爲、完全背義失信、侵略我國、已是毀棄九國公約、其後炸沉美艦、槍擊英使、又在長沙炸傷英艦、外僑生命財產之被損害、不可勝計、最近封鎖鼓浪嶼及天津租界、爲任何人所不能忍受、我們看兩年來世界對日本的輿論、就可以知道、最近德國毅然和蘇聯締結互不侵犯協商條約、就是顯明認爲日無力量、所以日本在國際上、巳完全陷於孤立、若竟不能覺悟、終必爲世界所共棄、此外日人還有一個敗亡因素、就是紀律之敗壞、巳至不可收拾、日人因爲軍事外交政治的着着失敗、而猶不能覺悟、所以這半年來、利用他優勢空軍、不斷的轟炸我們後方不設防的城市、企圖擾亂我們的後方、打擊我國的人心、但這不是武力强大的表現、而正是表現對我無計可施的窘狀、就重慶而言、各位可以看得着我們的民衆、決沒有因轟炸而减低抗戰精神與決心、我們的軍隊、數量上較武漢會戰前增加一倍、戰的技術技能、因長期的作戰經騐、而長足進步、所以戰門力較武漢會戰前加强了幾倍、這些詳細情形、本已過去曾在各方面報告、現在不必再報、簡單設、就是日人的戰力是日趨衰微、而我們是越打越强、至於國際上對於我國、已由精神的同情而至實除的援助、而我們全國精神的團結、意志之集中、和信仰唯一的主義、服從唯一的領袖、更爲日人所不能及、所以我之必勝、是很可以預判的、我們能够奠定勝利的基礎、能够獲得國際的同情和援助、完全是因爲我們全國人自己的努力、完全是因爲我們素來尊重信義愛好和平、而此次的抗戰又爲維持人類正義和平而戰、決不是僥倖的、現在我們最後勝利的獲得、已一天接近一天、只希望我們無論前方後方的同志、和無論前後方的同胞、益加團結、再接再厲、共同努力來完成這抗戰最後一簣的工作、（二十九日電）</p>

<h3>法波兩國外交的運用　倫敦航訉</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>按自德蘇互不侵犯協定成立後，德國對波態度，益趨强硬。此函猶爲該約宣布前十餘日所發，歐洲情勢，與今逈異，故函中有所謂「但澤問題，這兩天來，突然鬆了下來，而大有退到不被注意的地位上去的趨勢」等言，然其內容，仍値得一閱也。－編者－</p>
<p>這些天來，歐洲形勢瞬息萬變，法·波·兩國外交運用的得當，實在是短期內穩定歐洲局面的最大因素之一。這兩個國家，在種種方面，都可能放在一塊並舉，不過近些時來她們外交的運用裹，我們却可以看出一個共同點來。這共同點是什麼呢？毫無疑義的，是同樣地與「張伯倫內閣路綫」着背馳的方向。</p>
<p>我們都知道一個公開的軍事秘密，那是：英國空軍去年以來從事擴張的目標，是本年十二月底及明年一月初之交，達到和德國相等的境地；法國呢，則在同一時期內，達到和意大利平等。德·意·當局，對這，當然是十二分的淸楚。如果德·意·是眞想冒險和英·法·開仗的話，那末，最好的時機，應當是本年年初。因而，當沙赫特博士對英經濟談判失敗以後，當時一般的看法，以爲是最危險的時期。尤其納粹戰略家，一貫是相信速決戰的，所以當時大家最擔心的，就是說不定會在什麼時候，希特拉會突然把他的戰鬥機構發動起來，直撲到英·法·的頭上。後來，危機終於安然地渡過了。那以後，時日不斷地前進，與之同進的，却是英·法·的龐大軍備擴張；而成爲反比例在遞减着的，却是戰爭的危險。再把視綫展開一點，遠東方面，中·日·間强弱之差，在明顯地變動著。而比起德·日·意·併在一處還要强大得多的蘇俄與美國又立在這一面。</p>
<p>一直到今天，還要說，英·法·萬一忠實於反侵略陣綫時，有被德·日·意·逕行加以攻擊的危險的話，那實在是欺人之談。成爲反侵略陣綫腹心之患的，倒是「張伯倫內閣的路綫」。這一「路綫，」具有着自行拆散反侵略陣綫的可能，因而，也就具有威脅世界和平的可能；而在當前這一個短暫的階段裹，就把英·法·兩帝國的生存，放入了一個最危險的境地。</p>
<p>所以，當英國目前舉國一致地在監督着張伯倫首相一流人物時，法·波·兩國近來外交運用的得當，實在値得指出來的必要。</p>
<p>首先是法國。去年慕尼黑會議以後，在歐洲外交壇玷上，法國的地位，一落而爲二等國。一年來，她的外交，也祇是一個二等國的外交。而目前，在歐洲這大危機又要到來的前夜，一般觀察家們又在估計着，萬一這一回達拉第還是尾隨張伯倫之後的話，那末，結果下來，法國的外交地位，會再落而成爲三等國。因而大家都爲法國前途擔心着的。可是近來，我們却忽然見到了達拉第非常有力的幾個步驟，眞是令人高興之至的事。那是；第一，英·法·蘇·同盟問題。英國國會一休會，立刻召回在莫斯科已經兩個月的史德隆；再然後，就儘可能地延長軍事代表團的出發期日。這原是張伯倫一流人物早就安排好的計劃。所以，國會休會的當天晚上，英政府就漏出消息，說是軍事代表團，也許要暫緩出發了，理由是；先要和法國代表之間，詳細交換意見和情報。然而大家都知道，法國代表團，早已就任命了的。而且遠在英國代表團任命之前，法國的意見，也早就通知了英國。英政府的這一着，分明是意在拖延。可是因爲國會巳經休假，英國輿論失去了一個最有力的奧援，大家都焦急得很。幸而法國却出了面。她逕行派代表團來英面洽，然後繞道赴俄。現在這一批英·法·軍事代表們，總算已經順利在途了，雖然原先是打算直飛莫斯科的，現在却改爲坐船，先繞道列寗格拉，結果總共多躭擱了一個禮拜。一直到現在寫着這篇通訊時，英國的現政府，對於英·法·蘇·同盟的成立，還是毫無誠意；吾則的話，牠早就應當停止對日的「東京談判」，對德的秘密接洽了。在這時，我們還是祇能把將來成功的希望，一大部份放在法國外交運用的身上。第二，對於遠東方面。法國願出全力，支持英國在遠東所取的步驟，這本是衆目昭彰的事。可是，也許因爲太追順張伯倫政策的緣故吧，因而，對於像東京方式」那樣純屈辱的外交，也跟着籠籠統統地在稱讚。法國有些報紙，竟然說是非常得計，理由是：英·法·幸而沒有上希特拉的圈套，去分心遠東，忽略歐局云云。接着，英國國會休會期决定後，最後一次的會議席上，張伯倫公然宜稱着，英國在遠東，除屈服外，實在是毫無辦法；因爲：（一）英國是一國站在那裏的，美·法·不加過問；（二）如果强硬的括，就須立即派遣主力艦，可是目前歐局緊張下，又絕對騰不出。在這時，法國却又採取了一個有力步驟。她立刻向英政府擔保，如果英國認爲必須派遣主力艦時，可以由駐大西洋的艦隊裏撥出去；至於空下來的大西洋防務，法國可以派艦補充。並且，法國的海軍當局，認爲在最近的相當期間的，德。意·絕對無力威脅英·法·的大西洋防務。這個消息一傳出，英國的人心，立刻爲之一振。然而現在，張伯倫首相派造主力艦的話，似乎又擱了起來。雖係如此，法國這一舉，到底也令張伯倫面目露得更加分明，今後應該少了一個最有力的藉口。第三，是對於反侵略集團形成的供獻。雖然在表面上，英國外交，對波蘭對土耳其等國，在單獨活躍著：可是我們知道，在另一面，盡着促成之力的，法國的外交作用，實際也絕對不小於英國。對土耳其的借款及割讓土地，是早已爲大家議爲賢明的舉措了。而最近，當西門財相不久前爲對波借款問題，故意延挨時，法國也立刻表示了合作的意思，並加以催促。法國願意目動借相當數目的款子，給波蘭去擴充軍備。這一舉措，要是和犧牲捷克·西班牙·等盟國的行爲一對照起來，令你小由不覺到法國外交的今昔大異。因了這一舉，那結果，就是促成了英·波·借款的部份成立。</p>
<p>不久前，我曾經提到過法國在今天國際形勢演變巾的任務現在我們看到了這最近的法國幾個外交措施。對於法國今後外交的動向，從這裹，我想是可以大體地推測得出來。達拉第內閣的任期，已經延長了一屆，今後的兩三年內，法國外交，是操在牠手足不前裏的。如果能這樣加强下去，一直不變，那末，實在是反侵略陣綫的福事。</p>
<p>其次，說到波蘭。</p>
<p>以前的歷次外交成就且不去說；最近這一回的波蘭外交運用成功，誠然是太値得注目了。事情的發生時期，就在八月初旬的那個十天以內。當時，我們都知道，在意大利，有着波河流域的大規模的示威演習，在德國，巳經有一百多萬大軍的動員，在但澤內部，又有六萬的武裝力量，準備動作。這樣的環境下，希特拉突然召見但澤的納粹領袖，擺出了對於去年對蘇台德一模一樣的姿勢。而同時，德·波·兩方，就開始了宜傳戰，弄德歐洲佈滿了暗雲。在英國，甚至有人在担心會被捲入了戰爭，而對外相哈立法克斯與波締盟的舉措，開始埋怨了起來。</p>
<p>可是這時，波蘭却做出了更令人吃了一驚的事；對但澤的議院，提出了最後通牒，限定在五號以前，撤回禁止波蘭在東普士邊境檢查員行使職權的命令。這時，大家一致認爲她太冒險了！因爲，當時但澤議院的措施，是出於希特拉自己的發動，縱使爲了個人威權，希特拉也絕難讓步。可是跟着第二步，波蘭却在邊境集合了兩師兵，聲稱準備進攻但澤。直到最後，但澤議院終於屈服了；這也就是希特拉的屈服！這眞是波蘭外交的一個重大收穫；大大地出於一般人意料之外，尤其是爲英國現政府的意料所不及。</p>
<p>她的成功秘訣，就是在於事前嚴厲地關閉了第三者調解和干預的門。</p>
<p>所以，醞釀了好幾個月的所謂但澤問題，這兩天來，突然鬆了下來，而大有退到不被注意地位上去的趨勢。因而，意外長齊亞諾，又在打算和德外長里本特洛甫見面了，大槪最重要的，就是討論對但澤間題下台的辦法。希特拉仍是在辦「武力外交」，而並非打算立刻發動大戰。</p>
<p>波蘭的勝利，對「張伯倫內閣路綫」，是一個重大打擊；使牠少去了一個向德國要好的獻物，也是對牠的一個重大警告，萬一英·法·不早日促成反侵略陣綫的話，德國是可以和波蘭緩衝的。</p>
<p>但澤問題外，下一歩，大家現在的目光，都在注意着匈牙利和南斯拉夫。（八月十一日發）</p>

<h3>照中交掛牌結匯訂米　准購英金一萬磅　虞和德等申請救濟民食　孔院長復電照准並免稅</h3>
<p>工部局昨發公告米價將逐步回跌</p>

<p>上海虞洽卿李馥蓀徐寄廎先生鍳、敬電悉、本年江浙各地、均屬豐收、方慮穀賤作農、及因阻碍運輸之故、使賤借國米、不能運滬銷售、而江浙內地、又被騷攏、避居滬上者日衆、兼以收容難民至八萬餘人、以至人口增加、存米不敷供給、每石漲至三十五元以上、尚屬無處購買、言念民食、至爲痛心、所請准照中交掛牌價格、申請購買英金一萬鎊、由各團體聯合訂購西貢米二萬石、准予照辦、希趕速運滬濟急、並特予免稅進口、以期减低米價、加惠平民、除分令外滙審核委員會總稅務司外、合亟電復查照、孔祥熙感、</p>
<p>工部局昨　發表公告</p>
<p>昨日工部局發表公告云、最近數日間、國米已源源向上海啟運、其數量足敷通常消耗之用、米價巳見减低、現在之售價雖仍過高、不能認爲滿意、但將來不久當有續見减低之望、關於米糧問題、本局在進行重要談判並考慮各種可以選擇採用之計劃時、不便隨時向外間闡明本局之立塲、已往數星期間、本局對於食米供給之狀况、無時不深爲關切、此項問題、不獨恒由本局各董事及職員等勝續討論、且有糧食供給委員會專司其事、該委員會之主席爲英僑卡台馬賽爾爵士、至於外間之謠傳、謂有所存若干食米、可在無論何時由本局任意處分、純屬不確、外間又謂近來米糧之匱乏、係由公共租界內之若干私人囤積所致、據本局調查所得結果、此說亦與事實不符、關於公共租界內所有食米數量、逐日均有報告、經本局審閱、各棧房等處所存米量、悉經本局隨時愼重查騐、法租界當道與本局對於米糧問題、完全合作、</p>
<p>疏通來源　最為切要</p>
<p>本局曾於一九三七年自西貢運米來滬、惟當時與現在之環境迪異、本局如照現在之外幣匯價、購運大批洋米、爲本埠居民長期之用、則在經濟上受重大損失之危險、自所難免、况在米糧發生恐慌以後、本局始終認定必須疏通自內地之來源、方可使此項問題、獲得真實實之解決、</p>
<p>嚴重狀況　顯見改善</p>
<p>因此本局曾向日本當道表示意見、請其對於自日方控制區域運米至上海一事、予以便利、本局之意見、業經日方予以同情考量、結果已使嚴重之狀况、顯見改善、本局在米糧發生恐慌以後、會與任何團體或私人、凡能協助運米至上海者、無時不相接觸、各方面之合作、本局至爲感紉、米價之劇漲、當然使階級較低之華籍居民、受影響最重、因此本局各華董對於此層、自當特別注意、某華董已設法籌措款項、爲採辦西貢米一千八百噸之用、以便應付難民及較貧之居民之急需、</p>
<p>首批洋米　啟運來滬</p>
<p>叉訊、本市商界領袖虞治卿氏、前因鑒於滬市食米存底不足、內地來源被阻、致米價急遽上漲、影響平民生計、至重且鉅、爲减除民食恐慌、安定一般人心起見、特採權宜辦法、提議訂購洋米、以資接濟、並首先向國外訂購一萬八千包、所有米款、由虞氏設法籌墊、茲據大光社記者探悉、該首批洋米、業於昨日由挪威商輪承裝、在西貢起運、預計下月十日以前、即可抵滬、至於各界最近集團訂購之洋米、決仍繼續採辦、款項方面、已籌集三十萬元外、必要時當由發起人虞洽卿等籌足一百萬元、以充實存底、遏平國米售價爲目的、</p>
<p>國米湧到　人心安定</p>
<p>叉據大光社記者探悉、工部局方面爲維持民食、曾向日軍當局洽商疏運內地米源、聞已得日方同意、故連日國米來源已暢、昨日河下到貨達十五船、計共二千三百餘包、同時蕪湖方面亦將有大量米糧運滬、故市民人心已趨安定、市塲方面因洋米即將到滬、國米來源又湧、故價格一致看跌、囤戶亦遂乘機脫籠、但買方則意存觀望、不願輕易進貨、致市塲進胃滯呆、一般囤戶、莫不呌苦、</p>
<p>米價可望　繼續低跌</p>
<p>米市塲昨日行情、因供過於求、交易淸淡、故價格又趨低跌、計新秈米暴跌三四元、最好爲二十五元至二十七元、頭號白粳跌三元、每石售三十元、頂高包子亦僅三十四元、較高峯時已跌去十餘元之鉅、糯米跌二元、計約三十七八元、據米業中人談、照現時米業市塲情形、米價可望繼續低跌、大致最多句日、米價或將跌近限價、</p>
<p>加拿大駐港　商務專員調滬</p>
<p>法參謀長歸國</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、加拿大政府駐香港商務專員杜克波斯、巳調駐上海、可望於十月杪來滬履新、英文大美晚報云、駐滬法軍司令部參謀長巴志大尉、頃乘阿拉米斯號輪返國、</p>
<h3>颶風轉向　昨夜侵滬市　風力極猛但移動甚慢　外轉行止已失去自由</h3>

<p>風向轉變　滬受侵襲</p>
<p>前晚六時觀察、颶風方向爲北西、故上海不致受襲擊、將在上海以北掠過、自方向轉變爲西北側西後、上海有被襲擊之可能、昨晚方向依然、晚間十時後遂被侵襲、昨日起巳有疾風陣雨、氣候轉變甚凉、今舟山羣島一帶、巳受颶風之襲擊、預料吳淞崇明一帶、亦已遭襲擊、</p>
<p>風雨滋擾</p>
<p>本埠自前日起即為風翼所擾、有疾風暴雨、當晚風雨澈宵、昨日風勢甚緊、浦江因船隻停止出入、故極爲靜止、祇渡輪仍在開行、路上行人稀少、又昨日午後零時起、浦江適有高潮、江西路。浙江路·南京路·英華街·廣西路·甘肅路·福煦路·薩坡賽路。等處、均有潮水胃出、路面一片在洋、又因受風勢影響、外灘江水溢岸、</p>
<p>浦江高潮　彌足重視</p>

<p>風力雖鉅　移動不速</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據海關信號站今（二十九日）晨十一時之報告、颶風襲擊或迫近上海之可能性已大减、該報告稱、今晨六時、颶風自前傳之地位、北轉的三十哩、其時颶風中心在北緯二九·五〇度、東經一二四·五〇度六〇哩以內、在上海東南的一八〇哩、江海關旗桿今晨懸黑球兩枚、表示颶風正向上海前進、至十一時移去一球、表示危險已减、信號站於今晨九時甫過、接得駛來上海之哈列遜總統號輪無線電訊、稱該輪在颶風中心以北的九十哩、附近並無强烈之風云、同區中駛往臺灣之日本貨輪一駛發出之相類之無綫電訊、根據此等消息、衆信颶風風力雖猛、惟移動較前益緩、風向北北西、朝山東半島前進、</p>
<p>昨下午起　風又轉緊</p>
<p>前日（二十八日）本市即有遭颶風襲擊之消息、海關遂於日問懸黑球一個、入晚改懸紅燈兩盞、警告船隻勿駛出口外、以免危險、至昨晨海關鐘樓屋頂旗桿上、仍高懸黑球二個、以示颶風尚未脫險、但至中午十一時許、有風勢變更向方之消息、斯時風勢確已稍殺、海關將黑球移去一個、至下午一時許、忽又接報告颶風復將到滬、乃即將移去黑球一個、復仍加懸、風勢亦漸緊、浦江內船隻本擬開航、繼又中止、</p>
<p>海輪行動　已受阻撓</p>
<p>昨日上午進口之輪船全無、出口有美郵船克利佛倫總統號、於昨晨七時起椗返美、法郵船阿拉米斯號、於上午十時許出口返歐、惟兩郵船、昨日是否駛出揚子江口、或在揚子口內拋錨避風、均無確訊、昨日下午一時許、進口一輪名大連（譯音）、五時許又有日輪新太古丸進口、大英公司之喀賽其號郵船、原定昨日下午二時出口、回返倫敦、因颶風來滬、暫行品止、一俟風勢稍殺、即行起程、今日原有意輪汝廉該薩號、亦由滬返歸威尼斯、昨據公司云、因颶風關係、今日能吾準時起椗、未能決定、須以風勢如何而定、又美國輪船公司之披亞士總統號、原定今日中午自美來滬、停怕於十二·十三號浮筒、今日能吾進口尚無確訊、太古公司廣東。江蘇兩輪、前日即應到滬、因颶風之故、廣東輪改今日進口、江蘇輪已改明日到滬、怡和洋行之定生輪、及同和輪、均應於昨日來滬、現亦改今日進口、出口之貴生·利生·兩輪、已延期二天、太古公司北洋班湖南輪、南華班慶元輪、今日能吾出口、亦不能確定、</p>

<p>大陸報云、英政府雖决定將天津暗殺案四嫌疑犯移交日人、惟嫌疑犯之本埠律師愛理思律師公館、昨（二十八日）接倫敦律師來電、將於九月初向此間英國按察使署提出保護人身法令狀之呈請、據辦理此普世聞名案件之愛理思律師公館瓊斯氏</p>
<p>切實聲明</p>
<p>英政府對於立即引渡嫌疑犯、八月二十六日似已作最後之决定、但迄無即將實行引波之徵象云、九月初、提出令狀之呈請、英按察使署之推事莫肅爵士、或將適於是時返滬、而呈請或將由推事瓊思</p>
<p>兩次聽訟</p>
<p>但推事瓊思預定不久離滬休假、按倫敦律師已得該四政治犯之書面授權、最先於七月初在此間英按察使署與倫敦呈請令狀、而引起普世之注意、惟先後均遭駁回、嫌疑犯之律師今方與時間相競賽、因各犯將隨時引渡也、然此案長此存在、則如有必要、將訴諸英國最高法院、</p>

<h3>青年少作自凟　健康即多一層的保障</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>春情發動的時期，爲個人於其一生之中，最易染成手淫習慣的時期，在女子方面，雖蓄有粘液，並沒有任何感覺的意識，但與男子同樣，神經有時發生緊張，因其生殖器，已完全充分的成熟，發生充血，而其精神的緊張的程度，似不及男子的强烈，此等粘液的蓄積，女子自身，也能感覺得出來的，到達相當年齡的女子，若聽到關於性的與自凟等談話，往往就有染成自凟的習慣，例如沒有知識的父母或看護婦等，爲使嬰兒不哭，即摩擦小兒的生殖器部份，所引起的惡結果，她們是毫不知道，事實上，小見的自凟習慣，是在不知之中染成，也有因不潔，癬疥，或太緊的衣服，染成自凟習慣的，小兒在極幼小的時期，若染成這個習慣，即在父母的面前，也要作那自凟的行爲，其父母旣對於自凟，沒有相當的知識，以爲是小孩的事情，即聽其自便，此種小兒，若一入學校，就不能去掉他自凟的習慣，沒有一個學校的學生，不犯此等惡習的，在學校裏耽於自凟的少年男女們，他們若結成一體，早晚要把這個惡習，傳染全校，在學校下課的時間，男女學生，如此耽於極端的褻談，而且學生們，若受自凟行爲或娼婦的誘惑，有時即陷入色慾的邪道。</p>
<p>自凟若不戒除，其身心的健康即無保障，蓋自凟行之甚易，易成習慣，使神經衰弱，遺精早洩，若不速戒速治，而其病態會延及全身，如面色蒼白，肌肉削瘦，頭腦漲痛，精神萎靡，健忘失眠，幸現在的醫學已發明內分泌療法可使該症澈底根治，如積極服以雄壯動物睪丸內分泌製劑男用「補體康」能使早洩，陰痿迅速消滅，性力健全，決無短促現象，同時使腦力振作，新陳代謝的機能促進，肌肉壯茁，面色紅潤，該劑藥力週到，廿四小時即能生精補腎，是故功效爲一切內分泌之冠，其女用「補體康」，功能調經種子。</p>
<p>現代醫學</p>
<h3>內分泌　在體內的地位</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>人與人相通，必有其相通之道，而身體內各組織器官之相通，亦必有其道，此其道卽特殊之化學成分是也。蓋此成分造於一定之器官，於諸血液中，循環而達到其他組織器官時，由於化學的作用，故於其機能，遂有顯著之影響。往往甲器官之作用，影響於乙丙諸器官之作用，其間相互連絡，以保全身生活機能之統一調和，而能任此重要之職務者，厥爲刺戟素Hormon亦卽今日所稱之內分泌物，而刺戟素之名稱，蓋起於希臘文之喚醒Opuaw之語根。而其所以又稱爲內分泌者，以大多數腺，其分泌物，均有導管送出於體表，如乳腺汗腺者，向外表面分泌，而胃腺，及腸腺之類者，向內表面分泌，惟內分泌之腺，皆反是。旣不具導管，而其分泌分物又多直接送入體之內部——卽送入血液中，因而得名者也。內分泌腺，以內分泌物與血中之現象，故稱之爲內分泌。</p>
<p>凡是人之智識之賢愚，性機能之發育與吾，亦全視內分泌機能之是否健全而巳。故對於內分泌之地位的重要，亦可以概見矣。</p>
<p>內分泌如一旦失去正常之機能，則身體發育卽發生問題，如下部短小，神經愚鈍，記憶力缺乏，精神渙散，不能集中，使事業無成，而在遺精，早洩，腎萎之症，亦多發於內分泌機能之紊亂者。德國內分泌學大家梅倫博士所發明之「補體康」，爲內分泌製劑中之權威，服之能矯正內分泌機能之紊亂，而起於正常，則因內分泌失常而發生之一切性病，與發育不全症，悉可治愈。</p>
<h3>肺病氣逆現象</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病患者如有氣逆現象發現，則病勞有相當之危險，無疑已入第三期肺病，有吐血者更現嚴重，故患者絕不可忽略，但依余經騐所知，只要患者能靜養，攝取富有營養物，並加以藥物之治療，無有不奏起殺回生之功效者，</p>
<p>最近有患者曾天源者？年二十四歲，無錫人，患肺病已有二年有餘，雖已遍服各中西藥，而絕然無效，去秋由朋友介紹來余處醫治，經用X光檢查之後，已發現肺部有大小空洞各一，已氣逆甚劇，盜汗甚多，病勢甚爲危篤，乃令服「補肺拿爾」並令攝養，三個月後病勢已去大半，再服三月而愈。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　遺精不能誤服劣藥　而應從事正當療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>有患者唐仁基者，無錫人，年二十五歲，（自訴）——十七歲時，因受劣友之引誘，會犯自凟之癖，但後即知害戒絕，一年後，即人某商店服務，工作繁忙，終日無片刻之休息，故精神頗感疲憊，未至三月，入夢忽有遺精發現，初時約五六天一次，後竟一二天須遺精一次，不勝慌惶，乃閱報章，見有某種固精片出售，購而服之，固屬靈騐，乃連服二月，自稱遺精已完全根治，不料停服之後，所患竟變本加利，日間工作之時，精液即自然流出，始知已受劣藥之害云云（治愈經過）——唐君精關寬弛，內分泌缺乏，乃令其攝生，投以「耐而斯遺精片」及睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」並每日電療十五分鐘，治療一月，遺精已根治，至今已歷三月，遺精從未復發，而肌肉壯茁，身體健康多矣。</p>
<p>淋病座譚</p>
<h3>淋病易治難治之樞紐</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病療法上之差別，實不可用一種定律言之，但於無定律之中，亦有其一定之定律，此定律者何？卽科學的定律是也。凡是能合科學定律的療法，則治療淋病，亦甚容易，惟一般醫家，囿於俗見，拘於陳法，不知進取改用最新科學方法，則雖經騐豐富，亦無足取，蓋經騐並不一定有價値，因爲死守老法，縱使某醫生有百年的經驗。亦毫不足貴，反之却有落伍之譏。原來淋病治療之難易，旣賴療法之是否合理，同時亦當使病家明瞭攝生方法之必要，如此配合此兩種必須之條件，則任何頑固之淋病，不畏其兇橫而終可制服。否則，縱使任何醫師經騐如何，而不注意到時代之進展，不知利用科學上發明之淋病特效藥，及不囑咐病家攝生之法，經必勞而無功也。</p>
<p>余固亦有二十年之歷史，但余不菲薄一般有效的療法，就余多年之研究，擇長捨短之結果，在內服藥方面，以淋病特效藥「克淋儂」爲最。因此劑係蛋白體黃色素混合製成，具有抗淋噬菌的作用，而一切新舊淋病所有之淋菌，祇要服用「克淋儂」，一如推枯拉朽；無不迅速獲愈。余更用德國最新發明之靜電療法，及抗淋血淸等，於急慢性淋中之攝護腺炎，關節炎，精囊炎，膀胱炎等，治愈尤快。</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角，並贈價値一元之「性病全書二册。</p>

<p>烚赤竟軋漲八十元</p>

<h3>紗花　喊賈之聲充溢場中　棉紗跌風再接在厲</h3>
<p>雙馬慘跌四十五元</p>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風甚熾、蓋以實銷屠导孱弱、香港帮因港幣貶價、且連朝廣帮吸收之額殊鉅、市面一呆、該帮首先將自己之貨抽出趕裝、躱避損害、於是對於紗號之貨、無意嘗試、由此籌碼一鬆、呌喊賣出者、勢如魚貫而來、昔日互相高抬、一變大家撳低、爭先恐後之出檔矣、故雙馬跌風最慘、實則天理循環、如此之漲、如斯之跌也、二一十支雙馬比上日價猛瀉四十五元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開局勢欠佳、因日本內閣辭職、外匯黑市大鬆、同業相聚大家觀風色而小動、相延九時五分後尚未開盤、實以現銷缺乏之故、旋後開價跌卅元、雙馬廠單價爲五百九十五元、現貨價爲六百七十元、一跌三十五元、嗣後仍無銷路、再跌九元、廠單價以同業買進、稍漲幾元、出六百元外、查半日成交統計僅七百十四包、行情雙馬跌四十三元天女跌三十四元、雙地球跌二十元、今日有棉紗三十五件、運厦門、十件運香港、三十件運海口、將茲各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<h3>纱價不振　棉市愈覺靜寂</h3>
<p>現棉交易、依然靜寂、廠方需要清談、蓋以紗價續跌三四十元之鉅、廠家對於高價原料、更無納意、加之各路新棉絡續上市、不過販運抵滬、尚覺困難、各路地頭之價、較爲廉宜也、蘇北來源繼續爽快、到通州花四百四十六包、現棉僅日廠大康廠進大賴拉二百件、價爲一百三十二元、鈔票送廠、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、廠方因日來紗價不振、心意甚淡薄、故未聞做開、日來倫敦純金價値飛漲、海關金單位亦由三元三角九分六昇至二元六角、折合每担原棉漲起五角餘、市上盛傳九月起海關關金將加値、故一般棉商均不願賤價出售也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨出因孟買來電報跌、多頭了結、美國股票市價、因歐洲風雲之緊張、股票軟弱無力、影饗紐的棉市殊甚、投機者在市拋賣頗烈、咋日市價、自晨至暮、始終無力振作、結果收盤時較之上日跌去二十餘磅音、惟歐洲各棉市俱漲、計印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦漲上餘磅音、</p>
<h3>蘇浙新花上市</h3>
<p>特訊、浙江方面新姚花、業已紛粉上市、近因德商輪船停駛、不久當可抵滬、京滬綫太倉嘉定等處、本年因天氣順適、新榣生長茂盛、故上市較往年爲早、開該處當地售價爲八十五元、業已開始拋盤交易矣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　限制輸入內地　布銷稅減</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>自國府逐步加强管理貿易匯兌後、由滬埠輸入內地之棉布、遭受嚴格限制，如壓低售價、提高滙率、核發採辦證制度、故各客帮以經營困難、去貨銳减、咋甬帮消息、丸月一日起、有每疋（四十碼計）加稅二元之說、客帮進胃淡薄、購囤各布、頗有隨市脫售之意、市盤頗呈軟化、惟廠方成本反日見增高、若謂市盤將繼續下墮、恐不可能、昨日白貨色布趨勢均疲、開盤大致照舊、而客帮小額手貨轉銷、故肯每疋鬆廉一角至五角不等、售價紊亂、本街成交粗布·細斜·色布·絨布一百餘件、甬帮辦色斜·藍布·綫呢·嗶嘰六七十箱、粵帮辦色布·色斜·元色·洋紗等貨二千餘疋、川滇及南洋帮衹添辦零星小額、本街門市及內地游擊區、批發生意、均一致衰落、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>白布市氣續軟、細布每疋再跌一角至角半、龍頭細布現貨降至十七元六角、惟十二磅飛魚細布本街有吃戶收羅、成交百餘包、由十六元九角半、回升至十七元一角、其他雜牌則一致下瀉、細斜形勢較堅、藍雙魚寶貝等牌本街染廠需要不斷、價乃穩定</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>疋頭定於今日出口者、計七十件運香港、三十件運廣州灣、七件運海口、三件運北海、十五件運厦門、惟屆時能否出口、當視風勢如何爲定、</p>
<h3>糧食　新陳湧到　米價急轉直下　客家甩價求脫貨　高粳開三十五元</h3>
<p>杜米　自各路新貨湧到一路暴跌後、計先後以最高價而論、已降落七元左右、若新貨絡繹不斷、市面尚有續小之象、昨則各路來源、河下雖僅到松江稱六號、而車輪包子抵埠者、計各區新陳各貨有萬餘包、人心更虛、大都棘手、本街店胃觀望於前、而行團各戶亦皆袖手於後、形勢呆頓、一般客家、際此遂不的而同、羣相猛甩、謀求速脫、尚難引起胃口、結果厚粳跌落三元有奇、一般早晚稻跌四元餘、陳新各尖貶削尤烈、最低者竟達九元之巨、而統計全市成交數尚不滿三四千包、計做開高錫粳三十五元、三十四元、蘇同崑粳三十四元、次至三十二元、河下早晚稻三十元、二十九元、原包三十元、三十一元半、陳蘆尖三十元、二十九元半、新川尖二十八元、次之二十五元、變元三十元、二十九元、陰元二十五元、陳羊尖三十二元、新羊尖二十八元、二十七元、團尖二十九元、二十八元、杜尖二十七元、查米今有一百包、運往厦門、</p>
<p>客秈　昨到源尤湧、江北蕪湖南京等新陳各秈到有七八千包、市傳某方對於封禁措施、漸見寬弛、近日來源已不似日前之一再被阻、且糧商請求販運、大量無米亦有邀准之傳、市上人心乃一致向下、而新到之江北新秈尤圖貶價早脫、昨高檔祗二十八元半、中决自二十七元至二十五元不等、高京秈三十一元、蕪秈三十元、次祇二十六元左右、比之前市乃在瀉三四元不等、</p>
<h3>回籠粉續見疲落　比廠盤低二角　小麥跌價動銷</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉市况續見暗鬆、蓋廠盤雖仍勉站原盤、而回籠貨則已逐見疲落、目下比廠盤巳降低一角外、內地散戶趁低略有吸收惟本街實銷、因米價回小、進胃銳减、故回籠貨籌碼依然充塞、價祇六元一角半至一角左右、較前又鬆數分、統市成交、的計二萬包、因風雨關係、交易極爲淸閑也、今日有三千包粉運厦門、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日跌勢殊爲猛烈、蓋緣連日到貨踵接、各廠進胃初時甚懈、良以米價大跌、本街粉銷轉滯、且北洋帮以水災影響、客銷無望、因此各廠原料需要甚淡、客戶見勢不佳、粉紛貶價求脫、始引起廠方之貪取、結果跌價動銷、計由福阜兩廠合辦京鎭常蘇等麥、共四萬餘包、最高價爲九元一角决至八元、比前小去半元左右云、</p>
<h3>證卷　內債續漲　外債升降不一</h3>
<p>證券暗盤昨日市況、漲風繼續俏俐、多方漸有吃胃、一般人以爲起因於日本內閣之改組、其實軍人內閣、不啻以牛易羊、未必遽改其故態、惟不可以繩、最近世態之瞬息萬變、觀於德蘇言好後之日英態度、先後判若兩人、因此各方頗有和平空氣之傳來、雖屬言之過早、、但亦須防其如德蘇之故智、迅雷不及掩耳、公債市塲做空者、已覺懍然、故市價縱有升沉、但終將作曲綫之上騰、昨開初爲茂太抬價買進、旋以同康大康恒孚等賣出而回落四五角、後以永康又乘低大爲吸收、大豐聯和亦有相當買進、賣戶除鴻康聯益外、零星散戶而已、故結果仍好起五六角至一元一角半不等、午後繼續高起三四角、但未能立定、成交總數共計的七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股一百五十股、價爲五元三角、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報告云、股市仍受歐局勢力支配、加以此决交割之煩重、更顯大衆與趣缺乏之一般、下午市况略呈起色、數千股怡和紗廠股在十八元左右之價成交、</p>
<p>倫教英商遠東各公司股票、本月二十八日（週一）·掛牌行市、呆滯少變化、僅古拉客傍橡皮微跌一便士半、爲十五先令七便士半、其餘均無變動、　古拉客林傍一五·七1/2跌00.1/2</p>

<h3>絲茶　茶價不跌</h3>
<p>近兩日來、洋莊綠茶銷路、因歐洲形勢緊張、非常冷落、各種綠茶交易、普通珍眉最爲呆滯、抽芯珍眉祇有零星走銷、蝦目珠茶雖比較活潑、但市勢亦非前比、蓋人心虛軟、茶價一致降低、昨市僅祇同孚保昌等行、買進珠茶珍眉等項、共計一百八十餘箱、珠茶售價三百八十五元、珍眉售價二百四十元、抽珍售價三百四十六元、市盤均較前見跌五六十元、後市尚恐難站定云、</p>

<h3>物價飛漲與加薪</h3>
<p>— 茫茫</p>
<p>「統一戰綫」這一口號喊出後，大家都集中力量去對付抗戰，階級鬥爭早已停止了下來。勞働者在能够維持最低限度的生活條件之下，無有不忍耐着的。而資產者也不像以前那樣去壓迫賣力者。在抗戰兩年來勞資協調的情形，眞是爲前所未見。</p>
<p>近幾月來，因爲上海地位特殊，物價的飛漲，直令人透不過氣來。這影響於勞働者允鉅。勞働者所得的報酬，原是維持最低限度生活的，現在生活程度突趨高漲，這在中上階級尚可以「節流」來解圍，而勞働者旣無「流」可「節」，現在連掙扎也復不可能了。幸而資產者深明大義，瞭解</p>
<p>苦大衆的困難，紛紛自動的加薪（如前天本刋所述），問也就很容易的解决了。這一方面固然是資產者逐漸理解「統一戰錢」的眞義；而另一方面也是明瞭壓迫勞働者的結果，除了不幸的衝突外，還會造成社會的不寗靜，從而影響到資產者的安定的生活。所以，自動加薪一舉，非但有利於抗戰，同時，於資產者自身也有好處的。</p>
<p>但，還有少數資產者停留在戰前的階段中，近視自己的利益，拒不答應勞慟者加薪的要求，以致發生了如意工罷工等不幸的風潮，是非常遺憾的事。不過，這中間基本的衝突是沒有的。多少還是有一點誤會。勞働者能够避不使用激烈手段，善意地去據理力爭；而資產者如能在可能範圍中讓步一點，勞資中間的隔膜，也就會消除的。</p>
<p>爲了使資產者易於接受起見，勞働者提出的要求不妨是動的，不是固定的。換句話說，隨着生活稈度的高低而增减酬報，這種動的條件，對於雙方都有好處。在資產者，生活程度低落，可以比例地减薪，不致永遠有較大的支出。在勞働者，日後生活程度又復高漲時，也可比例地再度加薪，不必重提要求，引起麻煩。</p>
<p>下面，就我個人所想到的幾點辦法建議之，以供社會上參考。</p>
<p>（一）加薪辦法不應依薪水的多寡比例支配，如一百元者加十元以及十元者加一元等辦法完全無用，因爲困難者原是小薪水階級的人，所以應以最低限度的生活費爲標準，酌加低薪額者才爲合理。（二）加薪不妨以米價高低爲準繩，因爲構成勞働者生活要素的，究竟是米啊！（三）不願加薪，可採用米貼方法，原薪額不加，薪水外依米市酌加津貼。</p>
<p>由資方購買大批白米，而以最廉價格轉賣與勞働者（避免囤積投機圖利）。</p>
<p>（五）由資方直接供給勞働者膳宿，使勞働者家庭移向內地去，以原薪水維持家庭生活。</p>
<p>（六）澈底掃除勞資中間的剝削。</p>
<p>這些條件，在資方看來認爲多一層支出，而在勞方收入也許反不如前，所以，勞資雙方是並不敵對的，相反，勞資雙方倒有一個共同的敵對的人，而抗戰正是爲了要消滅這樣的障碍。勞資精誠合作是安定國內有助於抗戰，那麼，勞資雙方爲了將來的自由幸福，也得要暫時忍耐把目前的困難解决之，不要使之擴大。</p>

<p>你知道此人是誰，便是這位中國留法學生成功了。果然，這天愛麗絲因爲頭痛，老早已睡着了。而且因爲母親已出去，家裏靜靜的睡得很香。一直到了馬路上救火車都來了，一片聲喧，方攪把她香夢驚醒。其實五層樓上，還有好多鄰居，他們都已逃下。他們難道不去喚醒愛麗絲，這一點公德心也沒有，只顧自已逃命嗎？這却不是的。他們以爲愛麗絲母女都出去了，愛麗絲的不去音樂會，是臨時取消的。又瞧見她房裹黑洞洞的電燈也沒有，更以爲她們母女不在家。愛麗絲從夢中驚醒，幸虧她的臥房，是臨馬路的，一瞧馬路上的情形，知道是失火了。她那時還不知道是那裹失火，因爲三層樓起火的方向，却在她們房子的背後。她趕緊的衣服也沒穿好，便奔到電梯傍邊，那電梯已經沒有人開，撳鈴也沒有人應。她連忙跑到抉梯傍邊，剛走下一層，只見一團濃烟，正向樓梯上捲來，撲到愛麗絲的臉上，連眼睛也張不開。愛麗絲尖銳的呌了一聲，知道失火的就是本公寓。忽然想到還有個太平鬥，從太平們出去到樓下，還有隻螺旋梯，所有生機，就只有這樣一綫了。她打開太平門，向下一看，喊聲：阿呀！那螺旋梯只賸了半段，下面的已經斷了。她仍舊奔回到自己臥室裹，推開窗子，想縱身跳下去。但是在五層的高樓上，如何跳得下去？跳下去也是手足折斷，腦漿迸裂罷了。她那時身上穿件雪白曳地長紗的睡衣，赤了玉雪一般的脚，似烏雲蓬鬆的黑髮，拖在滿頭頸，滿背心，跪在地上禱告。等那烈火燒到自己身上，再無別法。心中還想：要不是爲了頭痛，早已和母親同到音樂會裹去了。也是我合該受此慘刧，所以把我一個人留在此間，想母親此刻還是在音樂會中吧？等你出來時，你的女兒已成為焦林枯炭了。主啊！你可憐我是一個無辜的女兒呀！她正在默禱時，只見從窗子裹，躥進一個人來。她也瞧不淸楚是誰，只見他走近前來，輕輕巧巧的把愛麗絲抱在手中。他附着她的耳朶道：『密司愛麗絲！我來了！你媽急得什麼似的，我們下去吧！」（一七五）</p>
<h3>汽車學校的內幕</h3>
<p>— 過來人</p>
<p>一個月放假廿天學些什么　實習一年還不敢去考照會</p>
<p>爲了要在暑期中獲得些技能，所以在大考後，便毅然到××汽車學校去報了名。學的是駕駛，除了卅二元的學費外，照會費也化了八元三角，其它的雜費還沒算。駛車地點在滬西一帶，爲了時間的任便，每天。車子一到指定地點後，誰都可以上去駕駛的。可是一輛破舊得不能冉破的蓬車，至多容六人，經過你爭我奪，力壯的常然佔得了座位，窳弱的我，只好眼送它們開去。一車……二車，到最後的一車時，方始有我的座位。報名時雖說有廿分鐘一决可開，事實上却沒有一决超過十分鐘。而且。假日又多得難以數計，除了星期日紀念日外，廢歷的節日，照校例亦得放假，還有意外的價日，像天雨車損等，有時爲了破裂一個車胎，就休息半日至一日，讓同學們一個個曝于烈日下的馬路中，它們從沒有走來通知過。如果車子內部稍有損壞時，接連放幾天假，是不算希罕的，所以它們常利用道點來節省它們的汽油，像這兩天的風雨飄搖，在它們正是求之不得的。一個月卅天，至少有廿天是沒開車的，這樣還能够練得純熟嗎？且拿我自己來說，聰頴不好算，還不致過份愚笨，到現在已學過了二閱月，駕駛的技術却依舊漠然，考照會只成了夢想。有很多同學習了快一年，還不能去嘗試。</p>
<p>二個月暑期巳荏苒地過去，多數學堂又開學了。當然，我不能讓寳貴的光陰，在空虛的期待中消滅，我得依舊於本位上努力去。不過我希望與我同志的朋友，不再重蹈我的覆轍，我是個很好的前車之鑒。並且我敢保證，除了這徒有外形的學校外，沒有再較它更腐敗的學校了。</p>

<h3>名旦于素蓮小姐談　舞臺生活及願望（上）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>（編者介紹）于素蓮杭籍，年二一十二歲；藝搜花杉，能劇亦多。其先常演本戲，眞才未露，去冬改隸「黃金」，始獲盡展所長；由是芳譽鵲起，劇壇地位，驟異往昔；而求進心切，初不自滿，前途造就，允未可量；於今南方坤旦行中，確是一位不可多得的優秀人。</p>
<p>在一面學戲，一面演戲的情狀之下，我這舞臺生活到今朝不覺巳有七個年頭了！唱戲是一件多麼繁難的工作，在這樣短促的過程中，藝術上當然不會有甚較高的成就，但是，自己抱定了很堅强的向學主張，並沒有一天稍微地忽視我的課程與業務。我很相信，成功常是屬於努力者的。所以，我的唯一任務就只認定在藝術之途上不斷的埋頭奮進</p>
<p>童年學戲</p>
<p>我的父親藝名于笑儂，向演在派鬚生，以前是北平喜連成科班出身。十歲那年，在杭州家裏，便敎我唱戲，因爲鬚生戲不很愛學，不久遷家寗波，亦即仍去上學讀書了。後來，到十三歲。移家來滬，方才開始投師學戲，而又側重於靑衣，花杉。說戲的敎師先後歷經二十多位，學過的各類戲目也很不少，算來大概巳有百齣上下了。</p>
<p>初次登臺</p>
<p>第一次登臺，記得是在杭州，唱了一禮拜的義務戲；那時還只十四歲，頭幾天初上紅氍，膽子還小，等到唱過兩三天後，却就意興倏發，更沒一些兒的怯塲情態了。此後，下苦工加緊學戲，同時又請了一位女先生敎書，到十六歲正在「一二八」滬戰發生的時候，恰巧寗波那裹有人來邀我們父女倆同去搭班，我們就在半逃難的情形下離去了上海。赴甬演唱歷一年，亦耶是我正式下海的起端。關於演戲經歷，從十七歲起，就只在南京，長江一帶度過一年多的流浪生活；翌年重回上海，隨即應邀共舞臺，演唱了近兩年，嗣轉卡爾登戲院歷八個月；到去年冬初，應聘黃金戲院，就這樣直到了現在。</p>

        <h1>1939.08.30</h1>
<h3>Chamberlain Announces in British Parliament: Final Reply Sent to Germany, Correspondence Temporarily Unannounced, Only Main Points Explained, Hitler Calls Party, Government, and Military Conference to Discuss Reply</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated this afternoon in the House of Commons that since the adjournment of the House on August 25th, the danger of a calamitous outbreak has not diminished, nor has there been much change. Although a great disaster has not yet arrived, I cannot say that the danger has lessened. During this period, the various developments in the situation should be reported to the House of Commons as much as possible. This will be the principle we will adhere to in any future meetings of the House. The Prime Minister then advised the press to exercise extreme caution in their statements, saying that inconsiderate remarks in the press, though not particularly important, could undermine the government's entire effort to seek a satisfactory solution. He also said that the British government's final reply to Germany was delivered to the German leader last night. We have stated therein that Britain's obligations to Poland will be implemented. We now await Hitler's response. The time ahead is for us to study the situation and allow the many forces working for peace to proceed, depending on the nature of the German reply. At the same time, we have no doubts or disagreements about our duties. Our resolve is not weak (cheers from the crowd). We have prepared everything. The Prime Minister then detailed Britain's military preparations, saying that air defenses have been well deployed, and the air force is ready for war. Although the issue of peace or war is still undecided, we will not slacken our resolve to adhere to our established course. We have no fear, nor any violent impulses. All this is due to our plans, and the calmness of the British people is also commendable. The Prime Minister then mentioned the exchange of documents between London and Berlin, saying that Sir Nevile Henderson returned from Berlin on Saturday night, believing that Berlin did not consider his return that day necessary. However, Hitler was eager for us to carefully study his note, so the British government spent the entire Saturday night and Sunday morning making a very careful and thorough study of the German document. It was then decided to reply, and the knight flew back to Berlin with the reply yesterday and personally delivered it to Mr. Hitler last night. He was happy to publish the contents of the two documents. However, members of the House should know that in such a delicate situation, with such a serious dispute, and with danger hanging in the balance, publishing such confidential documents or commenting in detail at this stage would not be in the public interest. Hitler was eager for a complete and lasting understanding between Britain and Germany and wanted Britain to feel his desire. Hitler also stated emphatically that the issue between Germany and Poland must be resolved immediately. The British government, of course, welcomes discussions with Germany to permanently resolve the dispute, but everything will depend on how the current dispute between Germany and Poland is handled. The necessary condition for a beneficial opportunity for discussion of the German-Polish problem is to reduce the tension on both sides of the border. Therefore, the British government hopes that the governments of Germany and Poland will do their utmost to prevent accidents from recurring and to stop the spread of false rumors and the occurrence of other dangerous events. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons convened at 2:45 PM this afternoon, and the hall was packed. Everyone present warmly welcomed Prime Minister Chamberlain when they saw him. The Prime Minister then delivered a speech, briefly stating that Leader Hitler had declared to our government his willingness to establish a complete and lasting understanding between the two countries and had also emphasized that various issues between Germany and Poland urgently needed to be resolved, in clear and unambiguous terms. Our country's obligations to Poland, which were confirmed by the agreement signed on the 25th of this month, will definitely be fulfilled. This has already been clearly stated. In short, the British government still hopes that the consultations between Germany and Poland can lead to a fair solution through free negotiations, thereby concluding a broader agreement that will benefit world peace. The key to peace or war is still undecided. We still hold hope and are willing to continue to work for peace. However, since we have chosen a course, we must adhere to it unswervingly. All naval, land, and air forces are ready and can handle all contingencies. (Members of Parliament cheered enthusiastically.) Thereupon, the House of Commons adjourned until September 5th, but could still be convened at any time if necessary. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Leader Hitler, along with key figures from the party, government, and military, has been holding meetings at the Chancellery without interruption. General Keitel and General von Brauchitsch, Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Minister of Aviation Göring, and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels all left the Chancellery before 4 PM. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) At 1 AM this morning, Leader Hitler was still at the Chancellery, discussing the document brought by the British ambassador and the German government's forthcoming reply with Minister of Aviation Göring and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop late into the night. It is believed that the written reply can be delivered to British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson this morning. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Flies to Berlin, Immediately Meets with Hitler, Berlin Political Circles Say the Door to Negotiations is Not Closed, German Government to Issue Important Statement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Nevile Henderson flew here from London at 8:30 PM today. He immediately drove to the British Embassy to talk with French Ambassador Coulondre. Then, at 10:15 PM, he went to the Chancellery, where Leader Hitler immediately received him. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Foreign Ministry interpreter Schmidt were present. Minister of Aviation Göring also arrived shortly thereafter. The meeting ended at 11:40 PM. It can be seen that Ambassador Henderson not only delivered the British reply to Leader Hitler but also discussed the situation at length. Afterward, an official statement was issued, saying only that Leader Hitler met with British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson at 10:30 PM in the evening, and the ambassador personally delivered a document from the British government. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Leader Hitler then held a meeting with key government figures, which lasted all night. It is generally believed that the German government will submit a written reply to Britain tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) When British Ambassador Henderson arrived at the Chancellery, the Black Guards saluted with their rifles and immediately led him to Hitler's office. Mr. Henderson quickly walked into the brightly lit inner room, where several high-ranking Nazi officials in brown uniforms stood up to greet him. Regarding the content of the British reply, not a word has been revealed to the outside world. According to Reuters, although the situation is extremely serious, the possibility of a peaceful solution has not been completely blocked. People in London feel that the key to peace or war in Europe lies in the hands of Hitler alone. Mr. Henderson was photographed by people when he left the London airport at 4 PM this afternoon, and he looked quite happy. Before leaving, he bid farewell to the reporters who saw him off, saying, "Thank you for seeing me off. I sincerely hope that this trip will have good luck." The plane Mr. Henderson took was a Lockheed airliner of British Airways, the same type of plane that Prime Minister Chamberlain took to Germany last year.</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is expected that the German government will issue a document, but when it will be issued is not yet known. The air here is filled with anticipation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin is now filled with tension and anticipation. After British Ambassador Henderson returned here with the British government's important reply, it is generally said that all events have now rapidly reached a decisive period. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Messengers Shuttle Between London and Berlin, Two More Germans Fly to London</h3>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Nevile Henderson, who took a plane to Berlin yesterday, arrived at Heston Airport in the suburbs at 3:30 PM this afternoon. There were three passengers in total, one British and two German. The luggage was labeled with the name of British Chargé d'Affaires in Germany Sir Forbes. British Airways officials refused to announce who the passengers were. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is heard that the British reply requested Germany to make a glorious retreat so that an international peace conference could be convened. This peace conference may be convened by Mussolini. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th) Rome The Roman People's Daily recently stated that according to remarks made by external personnel today, the British note to Germany contained the suggestion that Germany and Poland first demobilize a portion of their forces and postpone for several months to allow the atmosphere to cool down, and then hold a meeting. If the British note is based on such naive remarks, then there is little hope for preserving Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Reliable sources in Germany say that Hitler completed military preparations last night. The regular army has been fully mobilized, totaling about 2.5 million troops, all of whom have been deployed to key locations. Nazi Party sources say that Hitler is determined to first recover Danzig and the Polish Corridor and then consider peace negotiations. However, if peace negotiations can proceed according to Hitler's wishes, he may change his attitude. Hitler is extremely willing to cooperate with all parties to maintain European peace, but all parties must make considerable concessions. Senior Nazi Party officials believe that there will be no military action this week, although they also acknowledge that the situation is volatile. German officials say that no genuine action has yet been seen regarding mediation. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A spokesman for political circles told a Reuters reporter today that the door to negotiations is still open, but we must insist on realizing the German leader's demand for the return of Danzig and the Corridor to Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Belgium and the Netherlands Mediate for Peace, Plan to Convene a Five-Nation Conference</h3>
<p>(Paris) It has been learned that Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierlot, during a meeting with French Ambassador Bargeton last night, requested him to convey to the French government that the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands are willing to come forward to mediate and try to convene a five-nation conference of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland in order to find a peaceful solution to the current crisis in Europe. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Belgian Capital The Belgian News Agency recently issued a message stating that Prime Minister Pierlot met with the ambassadors of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and the envoy of Poland, and the discussion concerned Belgium taking on the role of mediator. However, official circles have not yet confirmed this. In addition, the Belgian government's preventive measures for the current military situation are already sufficient, and there are no plans to take further action for the time being. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>(London) Diplomatic and political figures here were unusually active today. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru successively visited the Foreign Office in the evening to conduct talks with foreign authorities. Shigemitsu Mamoru stayed at the Foreign Office for an hour and a half. Dominion Secretary Inskip summoned senior commissioners stationed in England from the various dominions to inform them of the contents of the government's reply delivered to German leader Hitler. Prime Minister Chamberlain met with opposition Labour Party leader Greenwood at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, reportedly also to explain the contents of the reply. In addition, the National Labour Movement Executive Committee is scheduled to meet in the House of Commons tomorrow evening to discuss the European situation. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain's Far Eastern Policy</h3>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to England Guo Taiqi met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax in London yesterday; the details of the meeting were not made public. It is rumored that the British Foreign Secretary provided assurances to Ambassador Guo, stating that even if there were drastic changes in the European situation, Britain's Far Eastern policy would not change. Both his words and his actions remain to be verified, but we believe they are credible.</p>
<p>In the past five or six days, the general atmosphere in the international arena, following the sudden signing of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, has become more gloomy and turbulent. This is because countries directly affected by the Soviet-German treaty, with their interests at stake, should urgently take action to adapt to the new situation. All changes involve much effort and are unavoidable and reasonable. There are also those who are driven by emotion, rushing and shouting without understanding the facts; there are also those who are confined by temporary changes, worrying about gains and losses, and acting like the hungry who do not choose their food. Upon examining the propaganda from all sides, weaknesses are evident; thus, the superficial turbulence appears more intense than the actual evolution. The assurances made by the British Foreign Secretary yesterday have the effect of making a portion of the international turbulence tend towards clarification and stability, which is commendable.</p>
<p>How has the international situation come to its present state? The causes, consequences, merits, and demerits are not limited to one aspect; some blame Britain, but in reality, Britain is hardly solely responsible. However, Britain is encountering the most difficult circumstances, which should be universally recognized. In Europe, it is the object of German resentment; in the Far East, it is squeezed by Japan. To be tough would risk triggering a war and sacrificing too much; to yield would risk losing national power and approaching collapse. To ally with the United States is often hindered by American isolationism; to befriend the Soviet Union is ultimately rejected by the Soviet Union's isolationist policy. As of today, it can only watch Hitler's moods while maintaining a strong defense. Although, the unity and firmness of British public opinion have never been greater than they are today. When it wanted to be tough but dared not, wanted to yield but could not, it wavered on the crossroads, and every step was wrong, only attempting to achieve both ends by luck, only attempting to find a shortcut. Now, although peace or war depends on Germany's decision, it is truly in a situation where it has reached the final turning point, and it is no longer possible to have other thoughts. If there is war, a mobilization order will be issued, and there will be no turning back; if there is no war, there will be a joint effort to resolve all kinds of disputes, which is not just a matter for Britain alone. When it was pursuing Moscow, it hesitated and had endless hopes; with many hopes, its ideas were inevitably mixed and impure; moreover, trying to abandon real contradictions and break traditional barriers with the Soviet Union, whose doctrines, policies, national character, and national institutions are completely dissimilar, is truly no different from simultaneously tasting sweet, sour, and bitter. Inevitably, suspicion arises, and one is overwhelmed with gratitude. Now, the signing of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany is a straightforward creation for the Soviet Union and Germany, and it clears away strange illusions for the international community. For Britain, it seems like an unexpected change, but in reality, it can recognize the true face, which is also a valuable harvest. The British do not say they have gained nothing.</p>
<p>Today's Britain, after twists and turns, returns to its original state, and after磨折, it becomes firm. It will inevitably put away its illusions from now on and have no other thoughts. Protecting national power and protecting rights and interests have no shortcuts, nor can they be borrowed from the international community. International relations, whether close or distant, must have a basis; it is not a matter of hastily following along and acting perfunctorily. Whether to cooperate or not depends on national policy and needs; each country has its own national policy. Seeking to change the national policy of other countries to suit one's own needs and appealing to diplomacy will ultimately fail. If needs coincide, it is better to respect the national policies of other countries. Examining Britain's Far Eastern policy in this light, there are three aspects that today's Britain can certainly fully understand: Given China's emphasis on trustworthiness and the shared interests of China and Britain, and given that China has adopted resistance as the only way to deal with aggression, and that China has adopted defending the integrity of its sovereignty and territory as the only goal of resistance, Britain should confirm its significance and do its best. Only strength should be considered; this is the first aspect. The squeeze that Britain has been subjected to in the Far East is fundamentally due to the contradiction between the interests of the status quo and ambition, not due to international incitement, not due to the conflict of doctrines, nor to any friendship, enmity, or grievances outside of interests. Today's changes in the international situation are not enough to reconcile fundamental contradictions, nor do they seem to be able to eliminate the ambitions of the other party. The impact of international changes on Britain in the Far East is, at most, that the squeeze it is subjected to may have different degrees of urgency and visibility in the future, but it will not be free from being squeezed; this is the second aspect.</p>
<p>The United States has a fixed national policy in the international arena. It has inevitable attitudes and distinctions towards China, Britain, Germany, and Japan. However, the efficiency of promoting its national policy will vary with the situation. Some believe that the United States sympathizes with Britain and France, so it will woo Japan in the Far East for Britain and France. This depends entirely on whether the Far Eastern policies of Britain and France suit the national policy of the United States. Others believe that if Britain and France woo Japan, they can offset the Soviet Union's change of heart. In fact, if the actions of Britain and France in the Far East conflict with the national policy of the United States, then wooing Japan can also offset the sympathy of the United States; this is the third aspect. The British authorities must be familiar with all three of these aspects. Therefore, what Foreign Secretary Halifax candidly said to Ambassador Guo is likely not empty words.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After visiting Mr. Machida, Mr. Nakajima, Mr. Kuhara, and others this afternoon, General Abe gathered his cabinet formation advisors Endo Ryusaku, Yokoyama Sukenari, and Kanozawa Toshiki at the Kasumigaseki Hall in Toranomon at 3:30 PM to discuss the active formation of a cabinet. The decision on all key members of the new cabinet must be completed by the morning of the 30th, and the inauguration ceremony of the cabinet ministers is planned to be held in the Imperial Palace in the afternoon of the same day. (Domei dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news released tonight, the selection of members for the Japanese Abe cabinet will be officially announced at the earliest tomorrow. The list is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: General Abe, Foreign Minister: Shigemitsu (Abe will temporarily serve as Foreign Minister before Shigemitsu returns to the country), Minister of Interior: Ohara Nao (former Minister of Justice during the Okada cabinet), Minister of Finance: Aoki Kazuo, Minister of the Army: Hata Shunroku, Minister of the Navy: Yoshida Zengo, Minister of Justice: Miyagi Chogoro, Minister of Education: Kawaharada Gaho (former Minister of Interior during the Hayashi Gonnosuke cabinet), Minister of Commerce and Agriculture: Godo Takuo, Minister of Communications: Nagai Ryutaro (former Minister of Colonial Affairs during the Saito cabinet), Minister of Colonial Affairs: Kanemitsu Tsuneo (Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives). (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Okuchi Zenroku of the Japanese Seiyukai has decided to join the new cabinet. (Domei dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Prime Minister Abe is currently very busy meeting with various leading politicians for the formation of a cabinet. However, it is generally expected that the new cabinet will be difficult to complete before Wednesday evening. The Japanese newspapers and financial circles have expressed their approval of Abe's appointment. The newspapers expect Abe to continue to pursue the basic East Asian policies of the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets, with the handling of the Sino-Japanese War as the primary goal, while in other aspects of the world, he will base his policies on enhancing friendship with other countries, in order to establish a new independent policy, but only with those countries that recognize Japan's mission to build a new order in East Asia and are willing to cooperate. It is believed that as a result of the rapidly changing international situation, Japan will inevitably be subjected to more external pressure. It is heard that people in the military here have expressed today their desire to see the new cabinet engage in strengthening national mobilization and the powers of the Prime Minister. It is said that the policies supported by the military include the following: (1) Establishing national unity and enhancing the national spirit; (2) Increasing military expenditures, especially to deal with the Soviet Union; (3) Expanding production capacity; (4) More efficient trade controls; (5) Adjusting national economic and social affairs. In addition, military personnel believe that Japan's foreign policy must be based on its policy towards China. It is heard that the military will adjust everything that hinders its work in China and must eliminate it. This morning, the Japanese newspapers all published comments on the resignation of the cabinet and Abe's appointment to form a cabinet. The Asahi Shimbun stated that although the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was the reason for the collapse of the Hiranuma cabinet, if a more accurate judgment is made, the executioner of the previous cabinet was actually the issue of strengthening the Berlin-Tokyo anti-Comintern axis. The Hiranuma cabinet had decided to adopt a policy of strengthening the anti-Comintern pact between Japan and Germany, which had been submitted to a five-minister conference for deliberation. Unexpectedly, Germany suddenly announced the conclusion of a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, so the thought conference could not but stop its discussion. Hiranuma and his cabinet accepted responsibility for the failure of their policies and resigned. The newspaper expressed its approval of Hiranuma's decision to stop proposing to strengthen the anti-Comintern axis with Germany, believing that he had seen that defending against communism had become one of the main goals of Japan's war against China. The newspaper also praised Hiranuma for leaving the responsibility of formulating a new European policy to his successor. The Hochi Shimbun predicted that Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, who most strongly supported the anti-Comintern pact and advocated Japan's joining the Axis military alliance, would soon be recalled to the country. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>After General Abe Nobuyuki was ordered to form a cabinet in Tokyo, well-informed political figures declared that the Hiranuma cabinet was forced to resign due to pressure from the military. At the same time, the military will have significant decision-making power in the selection of new cabinet members and the drafting of new government plans. It is said that Minister of the Army Itagaki still enjoys the trust of the military, opposing the inclusion of former Foreign Minister Ugaki, Hirota, former Ambassador to England Yoshida, and Ambassador to France Sato in the cabinet, but agreeing to Ambassador to England Shigemitsu Mamoru's assumption of a cabinet post. In addition, the military also requested more action and fewer meetings to increase the Prime Minister's authority and to quickly end the war against China. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph today published an editorial on the resignation of the Japanese cabinet, stating that regardless of who is chosen for the new cabinet, one thing can be said for certain: trusting in Germany's promises is no longer their creed. Moreover, under the current circumstances, reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Japan is a distant prospect. The Italian guarantee given to Foreign Minister Arita, adjusting Italy's attitude towards Japan so that it will not change due to Germany's actions, is sure to be accepted by Japan. However, from Japan's perspective, the anti-Comintern pact is equivalent to being shattered, and this guarantee has no deep impact. The newspaper concluded that Japanese politicians will be motivated by a new concept in the future and will seek friendship outside their own borders. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Three Prominent Figures of the Ministry of Finance All Enter the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Japanese Financial and Industrial Circles Hold High Expectations for Aoki</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Minister of Finance in the Abe Cabinet has finally been appointed: Aoki Kazuo, President of the Planning Board. The so-called three prominent figures of the Ministry of Finance are Kaya, Ishiwatari, and Aoki. Now, with the formation of this new cabinet, all three gentlemen are simultaneously appointed as ministers, which is indeed a beautiful thing. Mr. Aoki hails from Nagano Prefecture. After graduating from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in Taisho 5 (1916), he immediately took a position in the Ministry of Finance. In Showa 11 (1936), he transferred to the Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau and Vice-President of the Planning Board. When the Hiranuma Cabinet was established in January of this year, he was promoted to President. With the birth of this new cabinet organization, he was immediately appointed as Minister of Finance. (29th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the expectations of the financial circles for the new Minister of Finance, they are listed below. After the formation of this new cabinet, what the financial and industrial circles here expect from the new Minister of Finance is the establishment of a Japanese-Manchukuo-China economic system and the adjustment of external economic relations. In general, the implementation of Japan's wartime economic policy is based on established principles that any Minister of Finance can clearly put into practice. However, regarding the crucial issue of how to smoothly navigate the complex and eventful wartime economic policies of today, many believe that the new Minister of Finance Aoki, as a long-time expert in financial administration, along with Kaya and Ishiwatari, are known as the three strongmen of the Ministry of Finance. Later, Mr. Aoki served as Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau and President of the Planning Board, implementing reforms such as expanding the currency and stimulating production in North and Central China. Part of this expertise is suitable for the new East Asian economic construction. Now, after the major tax system reform, the calculation of the next fiscal year's budget is very urgent. Furthermore, there are complex and diverse international financial situations, such as the outbreak of the European War, which need to be addressed. How the new Minister of Finance will demonstrate his abilities is something we are paying close attention to. It is also hoped that government and the private sector will cooperate to prevent any drastic changes in the financial world. What the industrial circles expect from the new Minister of Finance is the establishment of a solid goal, a willingness to adapt policies as much as possible, and cooperation with those with will and drive. However, Mr. Aoki is generally recognized here as an authority on financial adjustment policies. Moreover, since assuming the presidency of the Planning Board, he has been striving to coordinate wartime economic operations and formulate mobilization plans for goods, and he is presumably well-versed in the industrial field. The industrial world places great emphasis on the so-called suitability of the new Minister of Finance upon assuming office. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be significant changes to Ishiwatari's financial policies after the appointment of the new Minister of Finance Aoki. Nevertheless, the new Minister of Finance has a thorough understanding of trade and exchange rate policies, so he will strive for new and active initiatives in export trade. The issue of establishing a Ministry of Trade will become more concrete. (29th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) Japanese sources in London claim that there is currently no confirmed information regarding the rumor that Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Shigemitsu Aoi, will be transferred to become the new Foreign Minister. Although Shigemitsu Aoi is a suitable candidate, the former Foreign Minister Sato Naotake is also one of the candidates for this position and is currently in Tokyo. If Shigemitsu Aoi returns to his home country to take up the new position, it will take several weeks to conclude the affairs of the embassy and return to Tokyo. They believe that the position of the resident ambassador in London is crucial in Japan's future policies, so it is more appropriate for Shigemitsu Aoi to remain in office in the UK because Shigemitsu Aoi is generally recognized as one of Japan's most capable diplomats and is welcomed in London. According to the general opinion of the Japanese in the UK, Japan must maintain neutrality in the European war. Currently, Shigemitsu Aoi is constantly communicating with Tokyo, and his advice is an important factor in formulating Japan's new foreign policy. (9th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of the New Army Minister, General Hata</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Army Minister, General Hata Shunroku (61 years old), is from the Tohoku region. He graduated from the 12th class of the Army Officer Academy, specializing in artillery. His family was poor. General Hata had a deceased elder brother, Eitaro, who was also an Army General. During his lifetime, he and General Hata were an honorable pair of Army Generals. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, General Hata served as the supreme commander of the Central China Front, and he wore the military sword left by his deceased brother to show that he would not forget his late brother's will. This is sufficient evidence of the harmony and affection between the two brothers. Furthermore, among the graduates of the Officer Academy in the same class as the General were the current Supreme Commander of the North China Front, General Sugiyama Moto, and former Colonial Minister Koiso. His classmates at the Prefectural First Middle School included former Minister of Justice Shiono and Professor Ikeuchi Hiroshi of Tokyo Imperial University. The General is a modern military officer who can endure hardship, is considerate, and has a clear mind. This spring, he established distinguished military achievements in Central China. After returning to his home country, he was appointed as Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor on May 25th. (19th Dispatch from the Allied News Agency)</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of the New Minister of Justice, Mr. Miyagi</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Miyagi Chogoro (62 years old), who has been appointed as the new Minister of Justice in the new cabinet, is a prominent figure in the Japanese prosecution world. From Showa 7 (1932) to 9 (1934), he handled a series of earth-shattering cases, such as the May 15th Incident, the God Sent Troops Incident, the Black Riot Group Incident, the Japanese People's Incident, and the Tokyo City Council Scandal. These major cases are worthy of the world's memory. Furthermore, Mr. Miyagi and Shiono, the Minister of Justice from a purely judicial background, and Chao Yuan Nei, etc., graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo University in Meiji 39 (1906) in the same class.

<h3>Japan Secretly Sends Overtures to Britain and the United States, Still Using Anti-Communism as a Pretext</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun published an article today, stating that if Germany can continue to show cooperation in Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia, then Japan will be able to enhance its friendly relations with Germany from a completely new standpoint. Japan's opposition to the Communist Party remains unchanged, and defending against communism is the greatest objective of our war against China. It is an inconceivable fantasy to suddenly change its policy towards the Soviet Union and immediately cooperate with the Soviet Union. Therefore, Japan's policy towards the Soviet Union is unlikely to change course for the time being. If Britain can proceed with everything according to the methods agreed upon by Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie and agree to cooperate with Japan, then Japan is prepared to conduct negotiations with Britain. Everything will depend on the extent to which Britain recognizes the reality of the Far East. As for the recent policies of the United States, there are many aspects that are regrettable. If the United States can correct its attitude towards Japan, then the friendship between the two countries may be maintained. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Britain Reassures China Again that Its Far East Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Guo Taiqi and Shigemitsu Separately Visit the British Foreign Secretary. The Two Meet in a Room but Remain Silent.</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax assured Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi yesterday that Britain's Far East policy will not change due to European disputes or the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. It is said that Mr. Guo explained to Foreign Secretary Halifax that what China has been striving for in the Far East in the past two years is no different from what Britain is trying to do in Europe. The goals of both sides are to fight against aggressors. Observers here believe that the Chinese government fears that Japan may become diplomatically isolated after the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, and that Britain may sacrifice China to seek understanding with Japan in the Far East. When Mr. Guo went to the British Foreign Office, he met Japanese Ambassador to the UK Shigemitsu Aoi in the waiting room outside the British Foreign Secretary's office. The two did not greet each other. Foreign Secretary Halifax separately received the ambassadors of China and Japan. The purpose of Shigemitsu Aoi's visit to the British Foreign Secretary has not been announced, but it is generally believed that he was inquiring about the latest developments in the European situation and informing the British Foreign Secretary of the Japanese cabinet reshuffle. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British and American Observers' Views on the Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the resignation of the Japanese cabinet today, saying that Japan has some reason to feel deceived. Many Japanese must have known long ago that Hitler would abandon Japan when the opportunity was right, but no one expected it to be so sudden. Without the warning of even a day, they were suddenly abandoned, and the beneficiary was their main enemy. Such a fate is certainly not welcome. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's contemptuous allusions when mentioning Moscow and his comments that Japanese-German relations could become even closer are enough to prove the unpleasant truth that Germany not only treats Japan with no courtesy but also regards Japan as a fifth-rate country. This is truly regrettable. But apart from wounded honor, Japan has not lost much and has gained a very valuable lesson. It can now freely plan its own future. However, its future has no ideological connection with Europe and is full of entanglements. Even if the situation in Europe clears up, the new Prime Minister Abe will still have many troubles. But one thing that Abe understands is that British-Japanese relations are very important to Japan. The new Japanese government also knows that there have been no surprising moves, ambiguous attitudes, or double-dealing tactics on the British side. The purpose of British Far East policy is still the same as when the Sino-Japanese War first broke out. Britain wants to have good relations with Japan, the same as it has with other countries such as China. Britain is happy to see the restoration of peace in China, but this must be a just peace. Britain demands that its interests in China be respected and is prepared to protect them. In summary, any improvement in British-Japanese relations is a contribution to peace. If the simple and firm principles of Britain are understood by the Japanese side, then there is nothing in British Far East policy that can prevent the realization of this improvement. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials are unwilling to make any criticism of the new cabinet until its personnel and policies are fully understood. However, according to those familiar with current affairs here, the cabinet reshuffle in Japan is due to a change in public opinion within Japan. Many Japanese people believe that the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty has indeed endangered Japan's security. However, some believe that Japan's future international activities are difficult to predict. In general, however, Japan will ease its hostile attitude towards Britain and the United States. This change of attitude is extremely reasonable, both militarily and commercially. After adopting this attitude, if the European war does not break out, then Japan's position in the Far East will not be too unfavorable. If the European war breaks out, then Japan can of course do more business without being resented by the democracies. Another political critic named Laurence argues that the United States should take advantage of Japan's abandonment by Germany to restore friendly relations between the United States and Japan. He means that Japan must accept the Nine-Power Treaty as the basis for resolving the Far East issue. China's territorial integrity must be maintained, but Japan's spheres of influence and economic opportunities in China must also be duly recognized. After the adjustment of US-Japan relations, the US fleet can transfer a portion to the Atlantic to cheer on the democracies. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Japanese cabinet reshuffle is receiving great attention from the State Department. Undersecretary of State Welles held talks with Ambassador to Japan Grew (currently on leave in the United States). British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay also visited Undersecretary Welles to discuss the situation in Europe and the political situation in Japan. (Ambassador Lindsay is scheduled to return to the UK on the 30th of this month.) Sources close to the State Department said that after the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, the most serious impact has been placed on Japan, which may now form a moderate cabinet and have the possibility of approaching Britain and France. As for the United States, if Japan forms a moderate cabinet and is willing to restore the balance of power in the Far East, then the position of the United States is very good. There is no end to the problems that the United States and Japan can discuss. In addition to concluding a new trade agreement, the "Manchukuo" issue can also be studied. Currently, Japan's policy in China completely contradicts the open-door principle on which US Far East policy is based. Now, if Japan is willing to change course and try to approach the United States, then the US government may act as a "faithful intermediary" and try to bring Japan and Britain and France together. Although this is hypothetical and the future results are difficult to predict, some State Department officials still hope that Japan's attitude will be more moderate, and said that if Japan joins hands with Britain and France, it will be enough to offset the impact of the Soviet Union's change of attitude in Europe.

<h3>Japan Still Deploys Heavy Troops on the Border. Hong Kong Authorities Remain Vigilant. Rumors of British Troop Withdrawal Are Not True. Schools Are Requisitioned as Field Hospitals, with Roofs Painted with Markings to Prevent Air Raids.</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong government is under orders to prepare for contingencies. The Great Hall of Hong Kong University and other parts have been requisitioned and converted into field hospitals. King's College and Queen's College will also be converted into temporary hospitals if necessary.

<h3>In Southeast Shanxi, Chinese Troops Achieve Victory After Victory. Japanese and Puppet Troops Are Planning to Retreat Separately. Changzhi Is Already Under Siege from All Sides.</h3>
<p>Luoyang: In the Southeast Shanxi battle situation, Chinese troops are achieving victory after victory. After capturing Jincheng and occupying Gaoping, they are pursuing northward with irresistible force. Most of the remaining Japanese troops have retreated to Changzhi. Currently, there are a total of over 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops near Changzhi, with some continuing to retreat north, and others gathering northeast of Lucheng, attempting to scatter and escape.

<h3>Chinese Troops Once Charged into Zengcheng</h3>
<p>Wengyuan: The Chinese troops besieging Zengcheng suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Japanese stronghold of Heling in the northern suburbs on the 28th. The Japanese resisted desperately, but were eventually bravely attacked by the Chinese troops, who captured a large number of them. The Japanese abandoned about 100 corpses and retreated to the north bank of the North Gate, confronting the Chinese across the river with artillery fire. Until 3:00 AM this morning, a unit of the Chinese × regiment, under the cover of artillery fire and braving the rain of bullets, swam across the river and charged into the North Gate of Zengcheng, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese for an hour, killing many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, a large Japanese reinforcements arrived and concentrated their firepower, bombarding the Chinese troops. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese troops who had entered the North Gate immediately retreated to the high ground in the northern suburbs, where they continued to fight fiercely with the Japanese. (29th Dispatch) Wengyuan: On the morning of the 28th, after a unit of Chinese troops once attacked the North Gate of Zengcheng, they retreated to the nearby suburbs due to the large number of Japanese troops and the small number of Chinese troops, waiting for an opportunity to continue their advance. Currently, the Japanese troops in the four suburbs of Zengcheng are all under intense pressure from the Chinese troops. Furthermore, on the morning of the 29th, the Japanese troops in Fuhe Xu and Datangwei (northwest of Zengcheng) were also being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese troops. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Under the Moonlight Night, A Large Number of Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing. Divided into Four Squadrons with a Total of Fifty-Four Aircraft. Bombs Dropped in the Western Suburbs Cause Three Fires. In the Air Battle, Two Aircraft Are Shot Down.</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Four squadrons of Japanese aircraft, totaling 54 aircraft, raided Chongqing at 9:00 PM, 9:30 PM, 10:30 PM, and 10:50 PM last night. Immediately after the initial alert, the Japanese aircraft launched their attack, which lasted for an hour and a half. The Japanese aircraft dropped 12 incendiary bombs in the western suburbs of Chongqing, causing three fires, but all were extinguished within five minutes. Because the bombs did not hit the refugee camps, the casualties were minimal. Several bombs fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River, with no loss. Although the moonlight was bright and the target of Chongqing was visible, it was not attacked. Thirty Chinese fighter planes took off to meet the attack and engaged in a heroic air battle with the Japanese aircraft. According to reliable sources, two Japanese aircraft were shot down. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) On the night of the 28th, Japanese aircraft once again launched a stealth attack on Chongqing. Under the moonlight, a fierce air battle broke out. When the Japanese aircraft invaded in batches, the Chinese air force waited for the opportunity to attack, inflicting heavy damage. One Japanese aircraft was shot down by the Chinese side. After defeating the Japanese aircraft, the Chinese air force returned in formation. The Air Defense Command had previously reported that three batches of Japanese aircraft, numbering about 20, were flying west along the Yangtze River from Hubei, with the intention of attacking Chongqing. The Chinese air defense forces made early preparations. Soon, the first batch of nine Japanese aircraft sneaked into the airspace from the north. Taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese aircraft had come from afar and were illuminated by the lights, the Chinese air force fought bravely. The Chinese artillery units also fired their guns to provide support. The Japanese aircraft did not dare to linger and hurriedly dropped bombs as they passed through the city's airspace before fleeing to the east. Subsequently, at intervals of no more than ten minutes, a second batch of nine aircraft invaded the city's airspace. The Chinese air force soldiers then redoubled their efforts and concentrated their firepower, launching a fierce attack. The Japanese aircraft were heavily pressured by the Chinese side and had little power to resist. Moreover, their formation was quite scattered after being attacked by the Chinese side. At that time, it was seen that the right-wing aircraft in the Japanese aircraft formation was hit by a shell, and white smoke came out of the tail of the aircraft, which fell from the air. Several other aircraft were damaged, and the remaining aircraft knew that they could not compete and fled east across the city's airspace. About an hour later, the third batch of Japanese aircraft still arrived on the outskirts of the city from the original direction. However, by then, white fog was spreading over the river, and it was no longer possible to distinguish the number of incoming aircraft. After circling in the air once, they did not drop bombs and fled in panic. According to a post-incident investigation, the Japanese aircraft in the first and second batches dropped bombs, but they all fell in the barren land in the suburbs, so the Chinese side suffered very little loss. The investigation is ongoing. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese bombers, divided into three squadrons, attacked Chongqing at 9:00 PM, 9:15 PM, and 10:30 PM last night, dropping bombs in the western suburbs. Therefore, explosions were barely heard here. The Japanese aircraft encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire each time, and Chinese fighter planes quickly engaged in battle. The alert was lifted at 11:30 PM. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Last night, the Japanese air force took advantage of the moonlit night to continuously bomb Chongqing three times. Each time, there were nine Japanese aircraft dropping bombs in the suburbs of the city. Chinese fighter planes took off to pursue them, and at the same time, anti-aircraft guns fired intensely. The Japanese aircraft fled one after another. The extent of the damage is under investigation. (29th Dispatch from Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Air Defense Command officially announced today that Chinese fighters shot down at least one Japanese bomber last night, and several other Japanese aircraft were badly damaged and may not be able to fly back to their original defenses. The second squadron of nine Japanese bombers appeared over the city of Chongqing at 11:15 PM, but were chased by Chinese fighters, causing the Japanese formation to break up. One of the aircraft on the far right wing was hit in the tail by machine gun fire and immediately caught fire and fell to the ground. (29th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman today, one of the Japanese aircraft was indeed shot down by the Chinese side during last night's air raid, and its wreckage was found on the south bank of the Yangtze River this morning. (29th Dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>

<h3>If War Breaks Out in Europe, China's Foreign Policy Will Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>—Statement from a Senior Official— Close Attention Will Be Paid to the Situation. The Hope for Peace Between China and Japan Is Extremely Slim.</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a senior Chinese official speaking to the Associated Press today, if war breaks out in Europe, China's foreign policy will remain unchanged. Because China's greatest task at present is to resist Japan, it is unwilling to pay too much attention to changes in the diplomatic world. However, China will closely monitor the situation so that we can change our actions at any time. Speaking of the Japanese cabinet reshuffle and the impact of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty, a Chinese official told the Associated Press that Japan currently has only three paths to take: (1) Compromise with Britain and the United States; (2) Compromise with the Soviet Union (According to the Soviet side here, the signing of a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan is in fact impossible); (3) Make peace with China. As for China's established policy, it is that unless the Japanese troops withdraw from China and the Japanese government changes its policy towards China, there is absolutely no possibility of peace talks. In other words, as long as the Japanese troops do not withdraw from China and the Japanese government does not change its policy towards China, China's resistance against Japan will not stop for a single day. According to the official, the hope for peace between China and Japan is still extremely slim at present. Although Japan has changed its cabinet this time, the policy of the new cabinet will still be the policy set before the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. Subsequently, the official believed that Japan's flattery towards Britain and the United States (such as automatically easing the blockade of Tianjin and withdrawing the Japanese troops from the Kowloon border) would not achieve anything, because Britain would never make major concessions that would ruin its interests in the Far East.

<h3>German Nationals in Shameen Have Not Received Evacuation Orders</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to authoritative sources here, the rumor that the German nationals in Shameen, Guangzhou, have been ordered to evacuate is completely false. (29th Dispatch from Haitong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Observations from Chongqing: Trends in Japanese Diplomacy; Pursuing Amity with Britain and America to Exert Full Effort Against Russian Threat</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to observations from the Chinese side today, the reason for the resignation of the Hiranuma Cabinet still lies in the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Japan's diplomatic policy has never utilized the Anti-Comintern Pact to restrain the Soviet Union. After the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, the effectiveness of Japan using the Anti-Comintern Pact to contain the Soviet Union was completely lost. Therefore, it was necessary to change the cabinet and re-formulate a new diplomatic policy. According to the Chinese side, the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet was due to its inability to end China's resistance after issuing a declaration of peace. As for the resignation of the Hiranuma Cabinet, it was because it could not maintain the core of Japan's diplomatic policy, the Anti-Comintern Pact. According to observations from the Chinese side, Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu indeed has the possibility of being appointed as the new Foreign Minister, seeking to utilize him for closer relations with Britain and America. However, the Chinese side is determined to respond to this Japanese conspiracy with all its strength. Furthermore, according to observers familiar with current affairs, the Japanese are now planning to transfer a large army to the "Manchukuo" area to prevent large-scale military actions by the Soviet Union. However, according to the Soviet side here, speaking to the Associated Press, the Soviet Union has no intention of attacking Japan. However, rumors that Japan and the Soviet Union will conclude a non-aggression treaty are practically impossible. Some people also believe that the fall of the Hiranuma Cabinet was due to its inability to defeat the Soviet troops at Nomonhan. Therefore, the appointment of the new Minister of the Army will inevitably strengthen its position against the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Reports: Military Overview for the Past Three Months; All Japanese Attempts Have Failed; Combat Capabilities Are Weakening Daily</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin reported on the military overview of the past three months at the Central Memorial Week this morning, stating briefly that, in the past three months, apart from the battles in southeastern Shanxi and the area around Minggang in southern Henan, there have not been any very fierce battles in other areas. Other relatively major situations were the Japanese landing in Chaozhou and Shantou, and the landing near Bao'an at the mouth of the Pearl River, and the battle of Shenzhen at the Sino-British border. (1) The battle in southeastern Shanxi: The Japanese in North China attempted to eliminate our troops based in the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi. In mid-May, they exerted all their strength and launched eight attacks on Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi. After our army bravely counterattacked, by mid-June, the attacking Japanese had been completely defeated. After our army recovered □□ on June 15, the Japanese changed their plan and concentrated troops from southern and central Shanxi, as well as the Pinghan Railway and Daoqing Road, and launched a five-pronged attack on the Taihang Mountains. Their main target was to attack Jincheng, because Jincheng is a very important stronghold in southeastern Shanxi. In July, there were fierce battles in Yangcheng, Qinshui, Changzhi, Licheng, and Linyuan. Although Jincheng was eventually occupied, our army then successively recovered Yangcheng, Qinshui, Changzhi, Licheng, and Qinyuan, constantly cutting off their lines of communication. Because the Japanese were threatened from behind by us, they used the main force of the XX Division to hold Jincheng and part of the XXX Division to hold Changzhi, while the other divisions were transferred back to their original locations. Our army actively launched counterattacks on various fronts and intercepted their outer lines of communication everywhere. Consequently, on August 20, Jincheng was recovered, and on the 13th, Gaoping was recovered. Now they are pursuing and attacking them on all fronts. The Japanese attempts in southeastern Shanxi have been completely shattered by this point. (2) The battle of the Japanese army landing in the Chaozhou and Shantou area: In late June, the Japanese drew troops from Guangdong and, with the cover of naval and air forces, landed in Shantou. Our defending troops resisted fiercely, but because the troops stationed there were relatively weak, Shantou fell. Our army withdrew to the mountainous area northwest of Chao'an according to plan. The purpose of the Japanese attack on Chaozhou and Shantou was to blockade our South China ports. Although a part of our commercial economy has been slightly affected, it is not of great consequence. (3) The battle in the Minggang area of southern Henan: The Japanese in southern Henan and northern Hubei had been lurking for a long time after the failure of the Battle of Suizao in mid-May. In mid-July, when the Japanese in Shanxi Province were carrying out a five-pronged attack on the Taihang Mountains, the Japanese in the Xinyang Changtaiguan area of southern Henan also gathered more than 10,000 infantry and cavalry and harassed the northwest in two directions. Their purpose was to contain our various routes on the south bank of the Yellow River in order to support their attack in central Shanxi. Thus, there was the battle in the Minggang area. On July 24, they invaded Minggang and on the 25th Pingchang, and then divided their troops to invade Qinyang and Tongbai, with one part harassing Queshan to the north. After interception by our forces in Qinyang, Tongbai, and Queshan, they were thwarted. Subsequently, our army launched a planned counterattack, and on August 3, the Japanese north of Minggang were eliminated, and the Japanese retreated south, and Minggang was recovered. (4) The Japanese army landing near Bao'an at the mouth of the Pearl River and the battle near Shenzhen: On the third day of the suspension of the Anglo-Japanese talks, at one o'clock in the morning, more than a thousand Japanese suddenly landed at Nantou, south of Bao'an, at the mouth of the Pearl River, and immediately advanced towards the border between Shenzhen and Kowloon. Shenzhen fell on the afternoon of the 18th. The purpose of the Japanese landing on the Sino-British border was to threaten Britain and make the Tokyo talks easier to concede, and to create the possibility of blockading Hong Kong, which had no particular impact on the Chinese military. As for the battle results we have achieved in the past three months, they have been announced by the responsible authorities at the end of each month and published in the newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. Looking back on the past two years of the War of Resistance based on the situation in the past three months, we can draw a general observation of the Japanese situation: (1) In terms of military affairs, the Japanese combat power has indeed become weaker day by day. Especially after the Battle of Wuhan, the Japanese offensive power is far from what it used to be. In battles such as Suizao, Zhongtiao Mountain, and Taihang Mountain, not only were they unable to achieve their expected goals, but they also suffered great losses. The reason is very simple. First, the Japanese have lost most of their elite troops after a long period of combat. Most of the replacements are reserve soldiers, and their morale and education are naturally far inferior. Second, the extension of the front line and the expansion of our war zone mean that the Japanese have to allocate some troops to every place, making it impossible to maneuver. The third is the disintegration of military morale. After two years of the war of aggression against China, not only the Japanese people have deeply realized that the Chinese people cannot be conquered, thus brewing anti-war sentiment, but also the lower-ranking Japanese officers and soldiers have developed a sense of weariness, which has led to anti-war behavior. (2) In terms of diplomacy, the Japanese behavior is completely unrighteous and untrustworthy. The invasion of our country is already a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. After that, they bombed American ships, shot British envoys, and injured British ships in Changsha. The damage to the lives and property of foreigners is countless. The recent blockade of Gulangyu and the Tianjin Concession is intolerable to anyone. We can see from world opinion towards Japan in the past two years that Germany's resolute conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union is a clear recognition that Japan has no strength, so Japan has been completely isolated internationally. If they fail to wake up, they will eventually be abandoned by the world. In addition, the Japanese have another factor of defeat: the corruption of discipline, which has reached an irreparable point. The Japanese have failed in military, diplomatic, and political terms, but they still cannot wake up, so in the past six months, they have used their superior air force to continuously bomb our undefended cities in the rear, attempting to disrupt our rear and strike at the morale of our country. But this is not a manifestation of strong military force, but a reflection of their predicament of having no other choice against us. Taking Chongqing as an example, everyone can see that our people have not reduced their spirit and determination to resist the war because of the bombing. The number of our troops has doubled compared to before the Battle of Wuhan, and the technical skills of war have been greatly improved due to long-term combat experience, so the combat power is several times stronger than before the Battle of Wuhan. These detailed situations have been reported in various aspects in the past, so there is no need to report them again. In short, the Japanese combat power is declining day by day, while we are becoming stronger and stronger. As for the international community, it has moved from spiritual sympathy to practical assistance for our country. Moreover, the unity of the national spirit, the concentration of will, and the belief in a single doctrine and obedience to a single leader are beyond the reach of the Japanese. Therefore, our victory is very predictable. We have been able to lay the foundation for victory and obtain international sympathy and assistance entirely because of the efforts of our entire country, and entirely because we have always respected faith, valued peace, and fought this war of resistance to uphold human justice and peace. It is by no means a fluke. Now, the attainment of our final victory is getting closer day by day. We only hope that our comrades in the front and rear, and our compatriots in the front and rear, will become more united, persevere, and work together to complete the final task of this War of Resistance.

<h3>Southwest Highway: Thriving Transportation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Fuxing Trading Company, a Chinese import and export trading company with the United States, will greatly expand its transportation capacity in September because 900 new trucks from the United States will be used entirely for transportation. It is reported that 100 of these new trucks have already started operating in Guangxi, specializing in transporting tung oil to the Annam railway station. It is reported that after all these trucks are in operation, the amount of tung oil transported to the United States each month can reach more than 4,000 tons. At the same time, a large amount of gasoline, machinery, and munitions can be transported in from the United States. After these new trucks are put into use, the number of trucks operated by the Southwest Transportation Company will reach as many as 2,000. The company's manager, the American Grove, and other American truck experts have established the most advanced transportation system in China. The training school established by the company has two branches, and 600 driving talents and technicians have been hired from Singapore and Shanghai as training cadres. Repair shops, refueling stations, warehouses, and dormitories are set up everywhere on the various routes of the Southwest Highway. At the same time, in the past, the life of a truck in wartime was only six months, but in the future, the life of a truck can be extended to two years. It is reported that in addition to transporting tung oil to the United States, Fuxing Trading Company also plans to transport it to the United Kingdom to repay loans, and also to transport it to the Soviet Union to conduct barter trade with the Soviet Union.

<h3>The Netherlands and Switzerland Implement Mobilization: Determined to Strictly Maintain Neutrality; Norway Calls Up Naval Reservists; Belgium Completes the First Step of Mobilization</h3>
<p>The Hague The Netherlands mobilized its army and navy, limited to the 15th class. From 3:00 PM today, all passenger cars nationwide will be temporarily suspended and used exclusively for mobilized officers and soldiers. However, international express trains will continue to operate as usual. Regarding the Netherlands implementing mobilization, external sources here believe that it indicates that the government has now abandoned its optimistic attitude and is preparing for war in case of emergency. (Haitong telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>The Hague Queen Wilhelmina gave a radio speech tonight, stating briefly that our country has decided to defend its neutrality. For the sake of vigilance, the government has taken various mobilization measures this afternoon. This is compelled by the situation and is understood by the people of the country. At this moment, the situation is indeed very serious, but preserving peace is not completely hopeless. As far as the Netherlands is concerned, it is impossible to maintain its neutral position without mobilizing the strength of the entire country. The government is aware of this and has decided to immediately take various active preventive measures to ensure complete safety. But in reality, our country has no reason to be threatened by any party. Our precaution is only because the situation is tense and we have to be careful." The Queen also ordered today that Lieutenant General Landell be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the national army and navy. (Havas telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>The Hague The Dutch government issued a mobilization order last night. The first batch of mobilized personnel is 650,000. The purpose of the Dutch mobilization is purely to maintain its neutral position towards all parties. At the same time, since last night, German troops along the Dutch border have begun digging trenches and setting up barbed wire and other defensive works. There are now few roads that have not been blocked by the German side. (Associated Press telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland The Swiss Federal Government has issued an order to mobilize the national border guards. From 5:00 AM tomorrow, 80,000 to 100,000 border guards will successively be stationed in the border areas. After the issuance of this order, the people of the country, especially the people in the border areas, have been deeply impressed. Many officers have arrived in the city of Basel today, and the situation in the city is even more tense. The Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Etter, also issued a declaration today, stating that Switzerland does not directly feel threatened, but the federal government is determined to defend its neutral position. At the same time, the government has also ordered the convening of a joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives at 5:00 PM on the 30th of this month to elect the commander-in-chief of the Federal Army. (According to the Swiss constitution, the candidate for commander-in-chief of the Federal Army should be elected by a joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, but this can only be done in wartime.) In addition, the government also issued an order to temporarily restrict the purchase amount of certain foods such as white sugar and vegetables. (Havas telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Capital of Norway The Norwegian Navy's 1935 and 1936 classes were called up yesterday. The State Council passed a decree yesterday prohibiting the export of fish, timber, and minerals. At the same time, Norwegian ships and shipping stocks may not be sold to foreigners. (Haitong telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Brussels The Belgian cabinet decided at yesterday's meeting to adopt various laws regarding ensuring national security and maintaining a neutral position. The Ministry of Agriculture is now implementing measures to ensure the nation's food supply. The artistic and valuable items in Belgium are now being moved to safe areas. Prime Minister Pierlot met with the ambassadors of Britain and France after the cabinet meeting and reiterated Belgium's determination to strictly maintain neutrality and resist foreign aggression. It is also learned that the first step of the Belgian mobilization has been completed, and the second step of mobilization has now begun. In addition, news control has also been implemented.

<h3>Hungarian Public Opinion: Advocates Neutrality; And Improves Relations with Romania</h3>
<p>Capital of Hungary The newspapers are commenting on the European situation. The Free Party's organ newspaper, Esti Kurir, stated that Germany is our friendly country, and Poland is a brotherly country. If war breaks out, it is most reasonable for our country to maintain neutrality. The newspapers of the government faction stated that it is the officially promoted policy of the government to maintain friendly relations with Germany and Italy, which is also in line with genuine and widespread beliefs. (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Capital of Hungary Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy received the Chief of Staff today to discuss direct defense measures to be taken in an emergency. Hungary has made new proposals to Romania, reportedly suggesting the conclusion of a treaty to protect minority ethnic groups. According to the Hungarian side, this treaty can greatly improve relations between the two countries. (Reuters telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Amidst War Clouds: Italy Sings of Peace; Mussolini Will Make the Greatest Efforts; Roman People's Daily Advocating War Confiscated</h3>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini stated that he will make the greatest efforts to seek peace in Europe. The official newspaper yesterday published for the first time that Mussolini had suggested to Hitler by telephone to resolve the German-Polish dispute with a peace plan. Gada, the spokesperson for Rachele, said that even at the last minute, the Prime Minister's policy is still a policy of peace. However, when presenting peace proposals to Mussolini, attention must be paid to the peace proposals previously put forward by Mussolini himself, so as not to contradict them. This means that Mussolini very much wants to convene an international conference, not only to discuss satisfying Germany's demands, but also to discuss Italy's demands. (Associated Press telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian radio station yesterday broadcast a speech commenting on Italy's attitude towards the international situation and expounding on the historical mission of the Axis powers. It said briefly, "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly issued calls for a peaceful resolution of international disputes based on the principles of rights and justice. At this moment, with the threat of war imminent, the Italian Prime Minister has not given up hope for a peaceful resolution. If the other party still speaks of re-establishing mutual trust, then we should answer that the Treaty of Versailles must be abolished before it can make amends for the facts. The Italian Prime Minister has devoted himself to the cause of peace for seventeen years. In order to seek world peace and justice, as far as the merits and demerits of the Axis countries are concerned, the Axis countries have worked hard to save the European crisis." (Haitong telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy is now anxiously awaiting the outcome of the exchange of documents between Britain and Germany. The people have not shown any warlike spirit and unanimously hope to preserve peace. This is the most prominent feature of the current crisis. All newspapers are saying that Mussolini is now working hard to maintain peace. The Postal News published an article by Battano, saying that Italy will first consider its own interests. The lesson that Versailles cannot be forgotten makes Italy have to carefully consider the move to rashly participate in the war. Peace is above all else, but if all attempts to maintain peace fail, Italy will not hesitate to abide by its statements. (Reuters telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>Slovakia: German Troops Enter; Plan to Attack Poland on Three Routes</h3>
<p>Bratislava The government announced today, stating briefly that German troops have now entered the territory of Slovakia and have been ordered to defend Slovakia when necessary. (Reuters telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times recently published a telegram from a correspondent in Bratislava, claiming that Slovak Prime Minister Tiso said yesterday that since the state is a protectorate of Germany, it should be prepared to "fight alongside" it. The correspondent also said that the German troops concentrated near the border between the state and Poland are divided into three routes. The first route plans to attack along the Vah River, the second route plans to attack along the Civalong Highway, and the third route plans to attack along the Presov Highway. The task of the Slovak troops seems to be to cover the rear of the German troops or to defend the areas near Hungary. The state is now stepping up the anti-Polish movement. All propaganda slogans are the same as those used by Germany. Residents in various places have held demonstrations many times, demanding the recovery of the cities ceded to Poland last September. Incidents have also occurred near the city of Katowice, when a team of Polish soldiers mistakenly entered the Slovak border and were immediately detained by German troops. A Polish officer was also killed. (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Advocate: Exchange of Nationals; To Resolve the German-Polish Dispute</h3>
<p>(London) The Times published an article today, saying that the German claim of a lack of living space is actually nothing more than a new German method of conquest. If Poland's treatment of the German minority is indeed a genuine pain, then this is merely a simple matter of moving this minority of Germans into Germany. The exchange of populations is a method of making political and ethnic boundaries suitable for each other. It has been carried out elsewhere in Europe and has been effective. This move can eliminate the source of this pain forever, but the excuse of pain is to seek strength, and the need for frequent trends is to coerce Poland, or to recognize this solution as unwelcome. The News Chronicle also made the same suggestion, saying that if Hitler is prepared to discuss the exchange of populations to solve the minority problem, as France and Turkey have already done and Italy is currently trying in the South Tyrol province, then this is indeed a proposal that can be discussed and is part of a general solution. (Reuters telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>US Authorities Closely Monitor: International Situation, Discover; Prepare to Convene an Extraordinary Congress When Necessary; Isolationists Gradually Tend to Abolish Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull gave a speech to reporters today, stating briefly that he could not disclose the situation in Europe and the Far East, but its development is being closely monitored by the State Department, and reports are being received constantly. It is rumored that the US government intends to convene a meeting of the American republics in accordance with the resolutions of the successive Pan-American Conferences and issue a final appeal to European countries, but in fact, this is not the case, but any head of a Latin American republic who can follow in the footsteps of President Roosevelt and issue the same statement is welcome. In addition, reports that the US government intends to appeal to Stalin for peace are also unknown to official sources. (Havas telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House has drafted a message, which will be signed by President Roosevelt as soon as it is certain that European war is inevitable, to immediately convene Congress to hold an extraordinary session. At that time, Congress should support the President and decide to aid Britain and France to the greatest possible extent. White House officials even said that Congress may go even further than maintaining "friendly neutrality" towards Britain and France. Although President Roosevelt does not intend to require the people to "maintain neutrality in speech and thought, as President Wilson did in 1914, he is determined to maintain lasting peace for the United States. (Havas telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to a Washington dispatch from the New York Post, the leaders of the isolationist factions of the Republican and Democratic parties, who previously struck down President Roosevelt's neutrality bill in Congress, have now decided to change their resolution when war breaks out. It is said that they do not want newspapers to announce their names. They have recently announced to people that they have changed their point of view because they now believe that the people of the whole country want them to make this change. If war breaks out, they will vote in favor of abolishing the current neutrality law. After examining the situation, they feel that there will be no difficulty in abolishing the current neutrality law. (Reuters telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Conference Discusses New Conscription Law, German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Approval Unlikely to Be a Problem</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to official sources here, the rumor that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has already been approved is incorrect. This issue is the third item on the agenda of the current Supreme Soviet meeting, and only the first item was discussed yesterday. It is expected that approval will not be possible until tomorrow at the earliest. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Supreme Soviet meeting was held today. Discussion of the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty will have to wait two or three days. The new Conscription Law and the Agricultural Tax Law will be put to a vote first. According to the current Conscription Law, the term of military service is already very long. In the army, infantry service is fixed at three years, and after the expiry of that term, soldiers continue to participate in military training for two years. The term of service for other arms, such as cavalry and artillery, is even longer. In the navy, the term of service for new recruits is uniformly fixed at five years. It has been rumored that the term of military service stipulated in the new Conscription Law will be extended for some time, but it turns out that this is not the case. The term of military service will remain the same. After the establishment of the new Conscription Law, the number of young men enlisted nationwide will be higher than it is now, because under the current Conscription Law, only one-third of new recruits at all levels are enlisted. In addition, young people across the country who have been deprived of their political rights by the government were originally exempt from military service, but from this year onwards, they will also be enlisted for six months. (Havas Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" in Moscow, the impression among foreigners in Moscow is that the reason why the ratification of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Agreement was listed as the last item on the agenda of yesterday's Supreme Soviet meeting is that if war breaks out and the agreement has not yet been ratified, the Soviet Union will reconsider its position if it deems it convenient. Yesterday, the Supreme Soviet unanimously passed a three-point agenda, the third point of which was the ratification of the new German-Soviet Agreement. The meeting lasted only five minutes. (Reuters Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<h3>Details of German-Soviet Trade Agreement Announced</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The details of the German-Soviet trade agreement were disclosed for the first time yesterday. The main points are as follows: (1) Germany will lend the Soviet Union 200 million marks, of which only 120 million marks will be used in the first year. (2) German goods exported to Russia include factory equipment, mining equipment, chemical industry machinery, and electrical equipment. (3) Soviet goods exported to Germany include agricultural and forestry products, raw materials, and petroleum. (4) Current trade is not included. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)</p>

<h3>Sweden and Finland Withdraw from the Gold Pound Group</h3>
<p>(London) The Treasury has ordered a ban on the trading of various overseas securities on the stock exchange, which has been met with satisfaction. According to stock exchange personnel, this is a good strategy for maintaining the pound. Today, the price of gold in London reached a new peak of 161 shillings per ounce, an increase of six shillings compared to yesterday. This is a natural result of the continued strength of the US dollar. (Reuters Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Sweden has now decided to withdraw from the sterling bloc, lowering the exchange rate of the pound from 19.4 kronor to 17.9 kronor. The Swedish krona is no longer linked to the British monetary system. After the government adopted this new measure, banks stopped exchanging pounds for Swedish kronor. It is believed that the value of the pound will fall again. At the same time, hotels here are also refusing to accept pounds, causing some British tourists to be unable to cash their pounds or pay their hotel bills to return home. (Haitong Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish National Bank today abandoned its link to the gold pound and set the exchange rate for the Finnish currency at 210 marks to one British gold pound. The previous exchange rate for the gold pound was 217 Finnish marks. (Associated Press Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Maneuvering by France and Poland: London Dispatch</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>According to information, since the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Germany's attitude towards Poland has become increasingly tough. This letter was sent more than ten days before the announcement of the agreement. The situation in Europe is very different from today, so the letter contains statements such as "The Danzig problem has suddenly eased in the past two days and has largely retreated to an inconspicuous position." However, its contents are still worth reading. - Editor -</p>
<p>In recent days, the situation in Europe has been changing rapidly. The proper diplomatic maneuvering by France and Poland is indeed one of the biggest factors in stabilizing the situation in Europe in the short term. These two countries may be placed together in many ways, but in their recent diplomatic maneuvering, we can see a common point. What is this common point? Undoubtedly, it is the same direction that runs counter to the "Chamberlain Cabinet Line."</p>
<p>We all know a public military secret, which is that the goal of the British Air Force's expansion since last year is to reach the same level as Germany between the end of December this year and the beginning of January next year; France, for its part, will reach the same level as Italy during the same period. The German and Italian authorities are of course perfectly clear about this. If Germany and Italy really want to risk starting a war with Britain and France, then the best time would be at the beginning of this year. Therefore, after Dr. Schacht's economic negotiations with Britain failed, the general view at the time was that it was the most dangerous period. In particular, Nazi strategists have always believed in quick-win battles, so the biggest worry at the time was that Hitler might suddenly launch his combat apparatus at any time and rush straight at Britain and France. Later, the crisis was finally overcome safely. Since then, time has moved forward, and along with it, the massive expansion of British and French armaments; and becoming inversely proportional is the danger of war. Expanding our horizons a little further, in the Far East, the difference in strength between China and Japan is changing significantly. And Russia and the United States, which are much more powerful than Germany, Japan, and Italy combined, are standing on this side.</p>
<p>Even today, it would be a lie to say that Britain and France, if they are faithful to the anti-aggression front, are in danger of being directly attacked by Germany, Japan, and Italy. The real danger to the heart of the anti-aggression front is the "Chamberlain Cabinet Line." This "line" has the potential to dismantle the anti-aggression front itself, and therefore also has the potential to threaten world peace; and in the current short-term phase, it has placed the survival of the British and French empires in a most dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, while Britain is currently united in monitoring Prime Minister Chamberlain and his ilk, the proper diplomatic maneuvering by France and Poland in recent days deserves to be pointed out.</p>
<p>First, France. After the Munich Conference last year, France's position in the European diplomatic arena fell to that of a second-rate country. For a year, her diplomacy has also been that of a second-rate country. And now, on the eve of this major crisis in Europe, general observers are once again estimating that if Daladier still follows Chamberlain this time, then the result will be that France's diplomatic position will fall again to that of a third-rate country. Therefore, everyone is worried about France's future. But recently, we have suddenly seen several very powerful steps by Daladier, which is really a cause for great joy. That is: first, the British-French-Soviet alliance issue. As soon as the British Parliament adjourned, he immediately recalled Strang, who had been in Moscow for two months; and then, he extended the departure date of the military delegation as much as possible. This was originally a plan that Chamberlain and his ilk had arranged long ago. Therefore, on the night of the adjournment of Parliament, the British government leaked the news that the military delegation might be delayed, the reason being that they needed to exchange views and information in detail with the French representatives first. But everyone knows that the French delegation had already been appointed. Moreover, France's views had been notified to Britain long before the British delegation was appointed. This move by the British government was clearly intended to delay. But because Parliament had already adjourned, British public opinion lost its most powerful support, and everyone was very anxious. Fortunately, France stepped forward. She directly sent a delegation to Britain for face-to-face talks, and then detoured to Russia. Now this group of British and French military representatives is finally on its way, although it was originally intended to fly directly to Moscow, it has now been changed to travel by ship, first detouring to Leningrad, resulting in a total delay of a week. Even now, as I write this dispatch, the current British government is still not sincere about the establishment of the British-French-Soviet alliance; otherwise, it should have stopped the "Tokyo negotiations" with Japan and the secret contacts with Germany long ago. At this time, we can only place a large part of our hope for future success on the diplomatic maneuvering of France. Second, regarding the Far East. France is willing to do its utmost to support the steps taken by Britain in the Far East, which is obvious to all. However, perhaps because it was too subservient to Chamberlain's policy, it also praised the purely humiliating diplomacy of "Tokyo style" in a vague way. Some French newspapers even said that it was a very clever move, because Britain and France were fortunately not fooled by Hitler and distracted by the Far East, neglecting the European situation. Then, after the British Parliament decided on the adjournment date, at the last meeting, Chamberlain openly declared that Britain in the Far East had no choice but to submit; because: (1) Britain was standing there alone, and the United States and France did not intervene; (2) If it was to be tough, it would have to send a battleship immediately, but under the current tense situation in Europe, it could not spare one at all. At this time, France took another powerful step. She immediately guaranteed to the British government that if Britain thought it necessary to send a battleship, it could be transferred from the fleet stationed in the Atlantic; as for the vacated Atlantic defense, France could send a ship to supplement it. Moreover, the French naval authorities believe that in the near future, Germany and Italy will absolutely not be able to threaten the Atlantic defenses of Britain and France. As soon as this news came out, the hearts of the British people were immediately cheered up. However, now, Prime Minister Chamberlain's plan to build a battleship seems to have been shelved again. Even so, this move by France has made Chamberlain's face even clearer and should have eliminated one of his most powerful excuses. Third, it is a contribution to the formation of the anti-aggression group. Although on the surface, British diplomacy is acting alone towards Poland, Turkey, and other countries, we know that on the other hand, France's diplomatic role in promoting it is actually no less than that of Britain. The loans and land concessions to Turkey have long been regarded by everyone as wise moves. And recently, when Finance Minister Simon deliberately delayed the issue of loans to Poland not long ago, France immediately expressed its willingness to cooperate and urged it. France is willing to lend a considerable amount of money to Poland to expand its armaments. This move, when compared with the sacrifices of allies such as Czechoslovakia and Spain, cannot help but make you feel the great difference between French diplomacy in the past and the present. As a result of this move, the partial establishment of the British-Polish loan was promoted.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I mentioned the mission of France in today's evolution of the international situation. Now we have seen these recent French diplomatic measures. From this, I think we can roughly infer the future direction of French diplomacy. The term of office of the Daladier cabinet has been extended for another term, and French diplomacy will be in his hands in the next two or three years. If it can be strengthened in this way and remain unchanged, then it is really a blessing for the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about Poland.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the previous diplomatic achievements; the success of Poland's diplomatic maneuvering this time is indeed too noteworthy. The period in which the events occurred was within the ten days of early August. At that time, we all knew that in Italy, there were large-scale demonstrations and exercises in the Po River basin; in Germany, there had been the mobilization of more than one million troops; and inside Danzig, there were 60,000 armed forces preparing to take action. In such an environment, Hitler suddenly summoned the Nazi leader of Danzig, putting on the same posture as he did for the Sudetenland last year. At the same time, Germany and Poland began a propaganda war, filling Europe with dark clouds. In Britain, some people were even worried about being dragged into the war and began to complain about Foreign Secretary Halifax's move to form an alliance with Poland.</p>
<p>But at this time, Poland did something even more surprising; it issued an ultimatum to the Danzig parliament, setting a deadline of the 5th to withdraw the order prohibiting Polish inspectors from exercising their powers on the East Prussian border. At this time, everyone thought she was taking too much of a risk! Because the measures of the Danzig parliament at that time were initiated by Hitler himself, and even for the sake of his personal authority, it would be difficult for Hitler to give in. But then, in the second step, Poland gathered two divisions of troops on the border, claiming that it was preparing to attack Danzig. Until the end, the Danzig parliament finally surrendered; and this was also Hitler's surrender! This is indeed a major gain for Polish diplomacy; greatly exceeding the expectations of the general public, especially the expectations of the current British government.</p>
<p>Her secret to success lies in strictly closing the door to mediation and intervention by third parties in advance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called Danzig problem, which had been brewing for several months, has suddenly eased in the past two days and has largely retreated to an inconspicuous position. Therefore, Foreign Minister Ciano is again planning to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, probably the most important thing is to discuss how to step down on the Danzig issue. Hitler is still doing "military diplomacy" and does not intend to launch a major war immediately.</p>
<p>Poland's victory is a major blow to the "Chamberlain Cabinet Line"; it has deprived it of a gift to ingratiate itself with Germany, and it is also a major warning to it that Germany can buffer with Poland if Britain and France do not promote the anti-aggression front as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the Danzig issue, everyone's attention is now focused on Hungary and Yugoslavia. (Sent on August 11)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attempts to Open Up Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Greatly Reinforces Shantou and Chaozhou, Corresponding to the Japanese Army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Guangzhou invaded Baoan, it successively increased its troops, attempting to invade Huiyang along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and then sweep through Chaozhou and Meizhou from Huiyang, connecting Zhangzhou and Xiamen in southern Fujian, in order to open up Fujian and Guangdong. Therefore, the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou has also been greatly increased since the 16th, in order to correspond. Half of the troops increased were from the Taiwanese army and more than 5,000 puppet restoration troops transferred from a certain place. Combined with the original Japanese army, there are now more than 10,000 troops. According to investigations, the battles in eastern Guangdong have been stalemated on the Anjie Road for more than a month. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. If it is not greatly reinforced, it is feared that even the strongholds on the railway stations cannot be guaranteed. Now, only on the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway line, traces of the Chinese army are found every day. Since the 17th, the Japanese army has only fired randomly from a long distance. On the evening of the 17th, a certain battalion of the Huazhen Middle Brigade of the Chinese army rushed into Fuyang Station and destroyed the platform. In this battle, more than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed and more than 30 feet of railway tracks were dug up. It was not until 2:00 a.m. the next morning that they retreated to their original positions. On the 18th, the Japanese army immediately transferred 200 troops from Shantou to reinforce Chaoan. On the 19th, they divided into two routes and advanced towards Fengxi, Fengling, and Yunti Mountain, one departing from Chaoan County and the other heading north from Anbu and Caitang, with tanks and cavalry as the vanguard. The Chinese army used hand grenades and machine guns to fight back at Niaoyang Mountain and Yunti Mountain. The Japanese army could not break into Anjie Road. On the 20th, they were still fighting fiercely. On the 19th, there were two Japanese destroyers in Shantou Port, one Japanese cruiser outside Mayu Kou, and four other transport ships. More than 30 steamships were moored in the port. Every day, more than a dozen ships sailed inland to loot livestock and food. On the afternoon of the same day, four armored fishing boats and speedboats, carrying more than 200 Japanese soldiers, sailed from Mayao Dianxi Island into Shantou, transporting a lot of military equipment and forcing the people to help them unload and land. These armored ships are equivalent to shallow-water submarines. Looking at their intentions, they have a plan to invade Jieyang from the waterway. Therefore, according to general observations, when the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is in a tight battle to spy on Huiyang, there must be a fierce battle in Jieyang.</p>

<h3>Sino-Foreign Exchange Rate Used to Set Rice Prices, Approval for Purchase of £10,000 Worth of Gold, Yu Hede and Others Petition for Relief of People's Food Shortage, President Kong Replies Approving and Exempting Taxes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Issued a Public Notice Yesterday Stating that Rice Prices Will Gradually Decline</p>
<p>(Chongqing, 29th) Shanghai's situation has become extremely serious due to Japanese and puppet obstruction of transportation and rice-snatching riots. Yu Hede, Li Ming, Xu Jiqing, and others jointly telegraphed President Kong on the 24th, requesting relief. President Kong, concerned about the people's food shortage in Shanghai, immediately approved the purchase of £10,000 worth of gold, to be used by various Shanghai organizations to jointly order 20,000 shi of Saigon rice, to be rushed to Shanghai for emergency relief. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Yu Hede and Others</p>
<p>To Your Excellency President Kong:</p>
<p>The Shanghai citizens are experiencing a severe food panic due to obstructed transport of domestic rice and difficulty in purchasing foreign rice due to black market restrictions. Investigations reveal that the total rice reserves in the entire foreign concessions are only about 80,000 bags, making the situation extremely precarious. Even at the inflated price of thirty-five yuan per shi for foreign rice and thirty-eight yuan for domestic rice, there is nowhere to buy it. The people are bewildered and greatly concerned. Moreover, the concessions are sheltering over 80,000 refugees, making food provision even more difficult. We, therefore, request your Excellency to consider the people's hardship and approve the application for £10,000 worth of gold at the Sino-Foreign exchange rate to pay for the 20,000 shi of Saigon rice to provide relief. Awaiting your orders,</p>
<p>Yu Hede, Li Ming, Xu Jiqing, respectfully.</p>
<p>President Kong's Reply Telegram</p>
<p>To Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Li Fusun, and Mr. Xu Jiqing of Shanghai:</p>
<p>Your respectful telegram is acknowledged. This year, Jiangzhe areas have had bumper harvests. We were concerned about farmers suffering from low grain prices and the inability to transport domestic rice to Shanghai for sale due to transport obstructions. Furthermore, Jiangzhe hinterland has been disrupted, and the number of people seeking refuge in Shanghai is increasing daily. Coupled with sheltering over 80,000 refugees, the population increase has led to insufficient rice supply, with prices rising to over thirty-five yuan per shi and nowhere to buy it. The people's food shortage is deeply distressing. Your request to purchase £10,000 worth of gold at the Sino-Foreign exchange rate for various organizations to jointly order 20,000 shi of Saigon rice is approved. It is hoped that it will be rushed to Shanghai for emergency relief. Special exemption from import duties is granted to reduce rice prices and benefit the common people. In addition to instructing the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee and the Chief of Customs, this urgent telegram is being sent for your information. Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Issued a Public Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Council issued a public notice stating that domestic rice has been continuously shipped to Shanghai in recent days, and the quantity is sufficient for normal consumption. Rice prices have already decreased. Although the current selling price is still too high and unsatisfactory, further price reductions are expected in the near future. Regarding the rice issue, the Municipal Council is conducting important negotiations and considering various optional plans, and it is inconvenient to explain the Council's position to the outside world at any time. In the past few weeks, the Council has been deeply concerned about the state of rice supply. This issue has been continuously discussed by the Council's directors and staff, and a Food Supply Committee has been specifically established to handle it. The chairman of the committee is Sir Victor Sassoon. As for the rumors that there is a certain amount of rice in storage that can be arbitrarily disposed of by the Council at any time, this is completely inaccurate. Furthermore, it is said that the recent rice shortage is due to hoarding by certain private individuals in the Public Concession. According to the results of the Council's investigation, this statement is also inconsistent with the facts. Daily reports are made on the quantity of rice in the Public Concession, and the Council carefully verifies the amount of rice stored in each warehouse at any time. The French Concession authorities are fully cooperating with the Council on the rice issue.</p>
<p>Dredging Supply Routes is of Paramount Importance</p>
<p>The Municipal Council shipped rice from Saigon to Shanghai in 1937, but the environment at that time was different from the present. If the Council purchased and shipped a large amount of foreign rice at the current foreign exchange rate for the long-term use of the residents of this city, it would inevitably run the risk of significant economic losses. Moreover, after the rice panic occurred, the Council has always believed that it is necessary to dredge the supply routes from the hinterland in order to achieve a truly practical solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Serious Situation Significantly Improved</p>
<p>Therefore, the Municipal Council has expressed its views to the Japanese authorities, requesting them to facilitate the transportation of rice from the areas controlled by the Japanese side to Shanghai. The Council's views have been sympathetically considered by the Japanese side, and as a result, the serious situation has been significantly improved. After the rice panic occurred, the Council has been in contact with any group or individual who can assist in transporting rice to Shanghai at all times. The Council is very grateful for the cooperation from all parties. The sharp rise in rice prices has naturally had the greatest impact on Chinese residents of lower social classes. Therefore, the Chinese directors of the Council should pay special attention to this. A certain Chinese director has found a way to raise funds for the purchase of 1,800 tons of Saigon rice to meet the urgent needs of refugees and poorer residents.</p>
<p>First Batch of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>It is also reported that Mr. Yu Zhiqing, a leader in the Shanghai business community, previously considered that the rice reserves in Shanghai were insufficient and the supply from the hinterland was obstructed, resulting in a sharp rise in rice prices, which had a very serious impact on the livelihood of the common people. In order to reduce the panic over food and stabilize the general public, he adopted expedient measures and proposed ordering foreign rice to provide relief. He first ordered 18,000 bags from abroad, and all the rice funds were raised by Mr. Yu. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency, the first batch of foreign rice was loaded onto a Norwegian merchant ship yesterday and shipped from Saigon. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai before the 10th of next month. As for the foreign rice recently ordered by various groups, the procurement will continue. In terms of funds, 300,000 yuan has been raised. If necessary, the initiators Yu Qiaqing and others will raise 1 million yuan to replenish the reserves and curb the price of domestic rice.</p>
<p>Domestic Rice Pours In, Public Sentiment Stabilizes</p>
<p>It is also reported by a reporter from Da Guang News Agency that the Municipal Council has negotiated with the Japanese military authorities to dredge the source of domestic rice in order to maintain the people's food supply. It is said that the Japanese side has agreed, so the source of domestic rice has been smooth in recent days. Yesterday, 15 boats arrived at the river, totaling more than 2,300 bags. At the same time, a large amount of rice will also be shipped from Wuhu to Shanghai, so the public's sentiment has become more stable. In the market, because foreign rice is about to arrive in Shanghai and the source of domestic rice is pouring in, prices are unanimously expected to fall. Hoarders are taking the opportunity to sell, but buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to purchase easily, resulting in a sluggish market. Most hoarders are suffering.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Expected to Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice market行情 was weak due to oversupply and sluggish trading, so prices fell again. Newly harvested Xian rice plummeted by three to four yuan, with the best quality selling for twenty-five to twenty-seven yuan. Top-quality white粳 rice fell by three yuan, selling for thirty yuan per shi. The highest-priced包子 rice was only thirty-four yuan, a drop of more than ten yuan from its peak. Glutinous rice fell by two yuan, estimated at about thirty-seven or thirty-eight yuan. According to people in the rice industry, given the current state of the rice market, rice prices are expected to continue to fall. At most in a few days, rice prices may fall close to the limit price.</p>
<p>Canadian Trade Commissioner to Hong Kong Transferred to Shanghai</p>
<p>French Chief of Staff Returns Home</p>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Mr. Duke Porth, the Canadian government's Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong, has been transferred to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of October to take office. According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Captain 巴志, the Chief of Staff of the French military headquarters in Shanghai, recently returned to his country on the Aramis.</p>
<h3>The Typhoon Shifted Direction and Invaded Shanghai Last Night, the Wind Was Extremely Strong But Moved Very Slowly, its Outward Movement Has Lost Freedom</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory reported: (1) At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the typhoon had reached 29.30 degrees east longitude and 124.30 degrees north latitude. The direction had changed from northwest to west-northwest. The wind force in the center was 60 nautical miles, but the wind was very strong. It is now 180 nautical miles from Shanghai, and Shanghai may be attacked. (2) The 4:00 p.m. report stated that the typhoon had reached 30.30 degrees east longitude and 123.30 degrees north latitude. The direction was still west-northwest, the wind force center was about 30 nautical miles, and it was still strong, but the progress was very slow. Also, yesterday afternoon, the wind force at the mouth of the Yangtze River was seven, and the wind force at Xujiahui in Shanghai was six. The wind force in the center of the typhoon is more than this, so the wind is still very strong.</p>
<p>Wind Direction Changed, Shanghai Under Attack</p>
<p>Observations at 6:00 p.m. the night before showed that the typhoon was heading northwest, so Shanghai would not be attacked and would pass north of Shanghai. Since the direction changed to west-northwest, Shanghai may be attacked. The direction remained the same last night and was attacked after 10:00 p.m. There have been strong winds and showers since yesterday, and the weather has turned very cool. The Zhoushan Islands area has already been attacked by the typhoon, and it is expected that the Wusong Chongming area has also been attacked.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Disturbance</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, this city has been disturbed by the typhoon wing, with strong winds and heavy rain. The wind and rain continued all night. The wind was very strong yesterday. The Huangpu River was extremely quiet because ships stopped entering and leaving, and only ferries were still operating. There were few pedestrians on the road. Also, the Huangpu River had high tides starting at zero o'clock yesterday afternoon. Jiangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Yinhua Street, Guangxi Road, Gansu Road, Fuxu Road, and Sapo Sai Road were all flooded with tidal water, and the road surface was all flooded. Also, due to the influence of the wind, the river water on the Bund overflowed the bank.</p>
<p>High Tides on the Huangpu River Deserve Attention</p>
<p>During this period of typhoon attacking Shanghai, the Huangpu River has high tides. Yesterday's morning tide was eleven feet two inches, the afternoon tide was ten feet zero four and six minutes. Today's morning tide is eleven feet eight inches, the afternoon tide is eleven feet zero two inches. Tomorrow's morning tide is twelve feet one inch, the afternoon tide is eleven feet two inches and four minutes. The highest of the morning and afternoon tides from the 1st to the 4th is eleven feet seven and a half inches, and the lowest is nine feet eight inches.</p>
<p>Although the Wind is Strong, the Movement is Not Fast</p>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, according to the Customs Signal Station's report at 11:00 a.m. this morning (the 29th), the possibility of the typhoon attacking or approaching Shanghai has been greatly reduced. The report stated that at 6:00 a.m. this morning, the typhoon turned 30 miles north from its previous location. At that time, the center of the typhoon was within 60 miles of 29.50 degrees north latitude and 124.50 degrees east longitude, 180 miles southeast of Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs flagpole flew two black balls this morning, indicating that the typhoon was heading towards Shanghai. At 11:00 a.m., one ball was removed, indicating that the danger had decreased. The signal station received a radio message from the President Harrison, which was arriving in Shanghai, just after 9:00 a.m. this morning, stating that the ship was 90 miles north of the typhoon center and there were no strong winds nearby. A similar radio message was sent by a Japanese freighter sailing to Taiwan in the same area. Based on this news, it is generally believed that although the typhoon's wind force is strong, its movement is slower than before, and the wind is heading north-northwest towards the Shandong Peninsula.</p>
<p>Wind Tightened Again Starting Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 28th), there was news that this city would be attacked by a typhoon, so the customs hung a black ball during the day and changed it to two red lights at night, warning ships not to sail out of the harbor to avoid danger. This morning, two black balls were still hanging high on the flagpole on the roof of the customs clock tower, indicating that the typhoon had not yet passed. However, at about 11:00 a.m., there was news that the wind had changed direction. At that time, the wind had indeed weakened slightly, and the customs removed one black ball. At about 1:00 p.m., a report was received that the typhoon was about to arrive in Shanghai again, so the removed black ball was immediately re-hung, and the wind gradually tightened. Ships in the Huangpu River originally planned to set sail, but then stopped again.</p>
<p>Ocean Liners' Actions Have Been Obstructed</p>
<p>There were no ships arriving in the morning yesterday. Departing ships included the American mail ship President Cleveland, which set sail back to the United States at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, and the French mail ship Aramis, which departed back to Europe at about 10:00 a.m. However, there is no confirmation whether the two mail ships sailed out of the mouth of the Yangtze River yesterday or anchored in the mouth of the Yangtze River to avoid the wind. At about 1:00 p.m. yesterday, one ship named Dalian (transliteration) arrived, and at about 5:00 p.m., the Japanese ship Shintaiko Maru arrived. The British company's mail ship Kasaki, originally scheduled to depart at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to return to London, was temporarily stopped due to the typhoon in Shanghai. It will depart as soon as the wind weakens. The Italian ship Ruliangaisha, which was originally scheduled to return to Venice from Shanghai today, was said by the company yesterday that it was uncertain whether it could set sail on time today due to the typhoon. It will depend on the wind conditions. Also, the American Shipping Company's President Pierce, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States at noon today and stop at buoys 12 and 13, has no confirmation yet whether it can arrive today. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong and Jiangsu ships, which were supposed to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, have been changed to arrive today and tomorrow respectively due to the typhoon. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Dingsheng and Tonghe ships, which were supposed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, have also been changed to arrive today. The departing Guisheng and Lisheng ships have been postponed for two days. It is also uncertain whether the Taikoo Company's Beiyang class Hunan and Nanhua class Qingyuan ships can depart today.</p>

<h3>National Salvation Bonds Pay Interest, Bank of China Telegraphed Chongqing for Instructions, Reconstruction Bonds to be Discounted and Paid from Tomorrow, Railway Construction Bonds Default on Principal Repayment</h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee, in order to maintain creditworthiness, will allow the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture to discount and pay tariff-guaranteed domestic debts. Reconstruction bonds will be discounted and paid from tomorrow. The payment of interest on national salvation bonds has been telegraphed to the Chongqing head office for instructions. Railway construction bonds will default on principal repayment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>National Salvation Bond Interest Payment Requires Instructions from Head Office: The National Government, in order to encourage the people to concentrate their financial resources and fill the national salvation expenses, issued 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds on September 1, 1937, stipulating an annual interest rate of 4%. Interest is paid once a year at the end of August, starting in 1938. The first interest payment was fully paid by the Central Bank at the end of August last year. The second interest payment, according to the regulations, is on the 31st of this month, totaling 20 million yuan in national currency. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank telegraphed the Chongqing head office yesterday morning to request instructions on the method of paying interest on national salvation bonds. It will be followed as soon as the head office replies. It is expected that the reply telegram will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Reconstruction Bonds Discounted and Paid: The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank received a notice from the head office that the seventh principal and interest payment of the 25th year reconstruction bonds, guaranteed by tariffs and due on August 31, will be allowed to be discounted and paid by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture in accordance with the unified bond method. The bank and its entrusted China and Communications banks will start discounting and paying from tomorrow. All bondholders should first fill out an application form for discounting principal and interest of tariff-guaranteed domestic debts, and the bank will issue a temporary receipt, which will be exchanged for a "discount certificate" in the future. Shanghai will pay in six installments, each installment being one month, and will be paid by汇劃票據.</p>
<p>Railway Construction Bonds Default on Principal Repayment: The third phase of railway construction bonds managed by the Ministry of Communications, the first and second issues, were each 40 million yuan in national currency. The regulations stipulate that the principal and interest payment dates are the end of February and the end of August each year. The fund is also managed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. Since February 1939, the third principal and interest of the first issue and the second principal and interest of the second issue have only paid interest and defaulted on principal repayment. This time, the fourth principal and interest of the first issue and the third principal and interest of the second issue, which are due at the end of August, will only pay interest and default on principal repayment. The National Debt Fund Committee has requested instructions from the Ministry of Communications, and will follow them after receiving a reply telegram.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Navigation of German Ships on Shanghai-Ningbo Line is a Temporary Measure, Future Definite Actions will Depend on European Situation</h3>
<p>After the German merchant ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line received a notice from the German Consulate on the 26th, ordering them to suspend navigation immediately, the Haiford of Reiss &amp; Co. stopped sailing to Zhenhai. Yesterday, a special envoy of Reiss &amp; Co. went to the German Consulate to request instructions on navigation matters, and the consulate allowed the resumption of navigation of German ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line on a temporary basis. However, the definite actions in the future will still depend on the tightness of the European situation. Also, after the fall of Dinghai County, the local residents have flocked to neighboring islands to seek refuge. The residents of Qingji Island, located between Dinghai and Zhenhai, are particularly numerous and urgently need to take ships to Shanghai. It is known that the EWO has dispatched the Lima to operate between Shanghai and Jintang to facilitate travelers. Haiford did not sail yesterday due to the typhoon. However, requesting landlords to extend rent increase 本埠, a joint association of Chinese and Western tenants in some apartments organized the Shanghai Tenants Association, which issued an open letter to Shanghai landlords yesterday, stating briefly that the association originally scheduled a mass meeting on the 23rd of this month, which was postponed due to the serious international situation, but does not intend to wait until the situation is clear to hold the meeting. It is now requested that the landlords consider postponing the rent increase request. If the landlords accept this request, the tenants will definitely feel relieved and will improve the increasing tension between landlords and tenants.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Community in Shanghai Remains Optimistic About European Situation, Believes that Hitler's Allowing Continued Negotiations is an Exciting Factor</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, it was learned today (the 29th) that the diplomatic community in Shanghai remains optimistic, because it is said that the European situation has improved as a result of the meeting between German leader Hitler and British Ambassador Henderson in Berlin last night. The diplomatic community also said that Hitler is now negotiating under the threat of force. Although Germany's urgent preparations for war are a "bad omen," no matter what the situation of the meeting is, Hitler's continued negotiations are an exciting factor. It is rumored that Hitler is somewhat disappointed in the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, because it is now rumored that the Soviet Union only concluded this pact with Germany because it is weak and unable to fight in Europe, rather than having any active friendship with Germany. There is a brighter prospect for the relationship between Japan and the Western democracies. This is another reason for optimism. It is said that Tokyo is forming a moderate cabinet, and Japan has an image of renewing relations with the Western democracies.</p>
<h3>Polish Government Appoints 巴斯德 as Chargé d'Affaires to China, 魏登濤 Summoned to Return to Ministry to Serve, Deeply Regrets Ill Health Prevents Trip to Chongqing to Say Goodbye</h3>
<p>Polish Minister to China 魏登濤, who came to China as Chargé d'Affaires in 1919, signed the Sino-Polish Commercial Treaty with former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting. In 1934, he was promoted to Minister. Up to this year, he has been in office for ten years. Due to old age and illness, 魏氏 has long been tired of his duties. Recently, he was ordered by the government to transfer to the Ministry to serve. He has decided to return to his country on the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company on the 3rd of next month. His successor has been appointed by the Polish government as 巴斯德 as Chargé d'Affaires, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai to take office on November 1. Before 魏氏 returns and the new appointee arrives, the duties of the embassy will be carried out on his behalf by Bao Hemolizhi, the Consul General in Shanghai. The reporter visited the Polish Embassy in Shanghai yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>魏氏 is Old, Has Been Ill for a Long Time, and Has Just Recovered</p>
<p>魏氏 is over sixty years old. His morality and writings have always been valued by the world. He is proficient in both English and French, and his wife is particularly proficient in French. In addition to his wife, he only has one ten-year-old daughter in Shanghai. In recent years, he suffered from eczema, with spots of skin peeling off. He was treated by both Chinese and Western medicine for a year before he recovered. It is heard that the Chinese doctor is from Qingpu and is Professor Li Ximou of Jinan University. This gentleman used snake gallbladder in medicine to treat him, and it was quite effective. Among the foreign ministers in China who take Chinese medicine for treatment, 魏氏 is probably the first one. Unexpectedly, after the eczema was cured, he suffered from appendicitis and was operated on at Hongen Hospital on July 4. Because he was weak and the weather was hot, it was not appropriate to use a knife to remove the abscess. What could have been cured in two weeks took a month to heal, and he was discharged from the hospital on August 5. 魏氏 was ordered to start his return to his country in mid-August and report to the Ministry in October. Now, because he has just recovered from a long illness and has difficulty walking, he had to delay his trip slightly. It is heard that he will first go to the United States for two months of convalescence and then return to Poland.</p>
<p>The Ministry Urges Him to Come, But He Cannot Overcome the Hardships of Travel</p>
<p>As far as the reporter knows, 魏氏 repeatedly planned to visit Chongqing in the two years after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War to visit the central authorities. This year, Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui repeatedly sent letters to 魏氏 urging him to come, but 魏氏 was unable to make the trip due to his weak health. According to diplomatic practice, when a minister of a country leaves his post and returns to his country, he must go to the seat of the host country's government to say goodbye. 魏氏 deeply regretted that he could not overcome the hardships of travel, so on July 26, he sent a letter to Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui to say goodbye, explaining that he could not go to Chongqing and expressing his apologies. It is heard that the Ministry has replied to Shanghai, extending greetings and farewell remarks. When the reporter arrived at the embassy yesterday morning, 魏氏 had just gotten up and was being examined by a doctor. 魏氏 sent an embassy official to meet the reporter on his behalf. Because the reporter was unable to meet with 魏氏, he asked the person who met him on his behalf to ask 魏氏: "Is Poland determined to resist? Will the European situation become a second Munich Agreement?" 魏氏 expressed very firmly that Poland's "determination to resist aggression" and "determination not to agree to convene a second Munich Conference" are beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>Yu Taosheng's Troops Prepare to Attack Nanhui Datuan</h3>
<p>The guerrilla forces of Yu Taosheng, scattered east of the Qinxiao Pond in Nanhui County, Pudong, are now taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese troops in Zhuqiao Town at the end of the Shangchuan Road have been repelled, so there is no need to worry about the north. Therefore, the main force is now advancing towards the Qinxiao Pond, preparing to drive out the Japanese troops in Nanhui City, Datuan Town, which are in a state of isolation. As soon as the deployment is completed, the attack will begin, and the civilians in the city and Datuan will be notified to quickly move to a safe area to avoid being suspected and harmed. Those villagers who are relatively well-off have been moving to the Shanghai urban area along the Pudong coast in recent days. Evacuees have been found in the Dongchang Road area of Pudong. Because they do not have "citizen certificates," they are often detained. It is said that Datuan Nancheng, regardless of the rich or the poor, has been evacuated, leaving only the old and weak. No shops are open on the streets, which is equivalent to a dead city.</p>
<h3>Rescuing Four Chinese in Tianjin: Another Protection Order to be Requested</h3>
<p>Petition Expected to be Filed with the British Consulate in Early September; No Immediate Signs of Extradition for the Four Chinese</p>
<p>A Mainland newspaper reports that although the British government has decided to hand over the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case to the Japanese, the legal firm of Mr. Ellis, the suspects' lawyer in this city, received a telegram yesterday (the 28th) from a lawyer in London stating that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus will be submitted to the British Consulate-General here in early September. Mr. Jones of the Ellis law firm, which is handling this world-renowned case,</p>
<p>emphatically declared</p>
<p>that while the British government seemed to have made a final decision on August 26 regarding the immediate extradition of the suspects, there are still no signs of an imminent handover. The petition for the writ, to be submitted in early September, might coincide with the return to Shanghai of Sir Mose, a judge of the British Consulate-General, and the petition may be heard</p>
<p>twice by Judge Jones.</p>
<p>However, Judge Jones is scheduled to leave Shanghai for vacation soon. It is reported that the London lawyer has obtained written authorization from the four political prisoners. They first petitioned for the writ with the British Consulate-General here in early July, attracting worldwide attention, but both times it was rejected. The suspects' lawyers are now in a race against time, as the prisoners may be extradited at any moment. However, if this case continues, they will appeal to the British Supreme Court if necessary.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Fractional Currency Notes Awaits; Postage Stamps to be Temporarily Used</h3>
<p>Central Bank Telegraphs Chongqing to Inquire About Methods for Distributing Fractional Currency Notes; Various Businesses Plan to Temporarily Use Postage Stamps for Market Stability</p>
<p>The Central Bank, upon orders from the Ministry, is issuing fractional currency notes, with an initial batch of 500,000 yuan, entrusted to the American company Yong Ning for printing. Originally scheduled for release on July 22, the issuance was postponed due to the discovery of sample notes in the market. For the sake of caution, the matter was extended, and negotiations were held with the printing company. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank that the branch had telegraphed the head office in Chongqing regarding the discovery of sample notes in the market and other related matters, requesting instructions. Therefore, the date of issuance will depend on the head office's reply to Shanghai before further action can be taken.</p>
<p>Various Businesses Still Hope for Postage Stamps as a Substitute</p>
<p>Since the Central Bank's fractional currency notes were suspended due to the incident, and at the same time, the post office declared its refusal to redeem postage stamps at face value, resulting in the stamps being unusable, various businesses in this city have faced numerous difficulties. In desperation, they hastily issued substitute currency notes. At the time, it was only intended as a temporary emergency measure, but unexpectedly, after several days, it was exploited by unscrupulous individuals who imitated the styles of various businesses and privately printed counterfeit notes, leading to repeated disputes in the market recently, even resulting in fatal incidents. The substitute currency notes issued by the United Dried Seafood Merchants Association have already been recalled due to the emergence of counterfeit notes. Other businesses are also well aware of the dangers and have ceased issuing them. The Chamber of Commerce and various sectors have already notified businesses, explaining the dangers and urging them not to issue any more. It is now known that various businesses in this city, in view of the lack of fractional currency, have suffered significant losses in their operations. If remedial measures are not taken as soon as possible, it will lead to serious consequences. At this critical time, merchants can hardly bear further heavy blows. In addition to requesting the Central Bank to issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible, yesterday, the Southern Goods, Northern Goods, and Tobacco Exchange industries jointly submitted a request to the City Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Exchange industry, requesting them to approach the Postal Bureau and ask it to consider the difficulties of the time and make special accommodations regarding the redemption of postage stamps, or to formulate alternative redemption methods, so that postage stamps can temporarily be used as substitutes to stabilize the market.</p>
<p>Tobacco Exchange Industry Urges Cautious Issuance</p>
<p>Recently, large and small businesses have been independently printing substitute currency notes for circulation in the market. Some are jointly issued by several businesses, while others are issued by individual businesses, in a wide variety of forms. Most are makeshift, using simple written words and adding the business's chop, making them usable. However, because of the inconsistent designs and poor quality of paper, and the number of notes issued is not publicly announced, they are easily exploited by unscrupulous individuals. Citizens who receive these substitute currency notes can only use them to make purchases at the issuing business. Other businesses often refuse to accept them, leading to frequent disputes, especially among tobacco exchange shops. The Tobacco Exchange Industry Association in this city, in addition to submitting a request to the City Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Central Bank to quickly issue fractional currency notes for circulation, has also urged its members to be cautious about issuing makeshift substitute currency notes that are prone to abuse, in order to avoid disputes.</p>

<h3>Youthful Masturbation: One More Layer of Protection for Health</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The period of puberty is the time when individuals are most likely to develop a habit of masturbation. In women, although there is mucus, there is no conscious awareness of any sensation. However, like men, nerves sometimes become tense, because their reproductive organs have fully matured and become congested. However, the degree of mental tension does not seem as strong as in men. Women themselves can feel the accumulation of this mucus. Women who have reached a certain age often develop a habit of masturbation if they hear discussions about sex and masturbation. For example, ignorant parents or nannies, in order to stop infants from crying, rub the child's genitals, not knowing the evil consequences this causes. In fact, a child's masturbation habit is often acquired unknowingly, or due to uncleanliness, scabies, or overly tight clothing. If children develop this habit at a very young age, they will masturbate even in front of their parents. Since their parents do not have sufficient knowledge about masturbation, they think it is just a child's matter and let them do as they please. If such children enter school, they cannot get rid of their masturbation habit. There is not a single student in school who does not commit this evil habit. In schools, young men and women who indulge in masturbation will, sooner or later, spread this evil habit throughout the school. During after-school hours, male and female students indulge in extreme lewd talk, and if students are tempted by masturbation or prostitutes, they sometimes fall into the evil path of lust.</p>
<p>If masturbation is not stopped, there is no guarantee of physical and mental health. Masturbation is easy to do and can easily become a habit, causing neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, and premature ejaculation. If it is not stopped and treated quickly, the condition will spread to the whole body, causing symptoms such as pale complexion, muscle wasting, headaches, mental weakness, forgetfulness, and insomnia. Fortunately, modern medicine has invented endocrine therapy that can completely cure this condition. Actively taking "Body-Building Tonic" for men, a strong animal testicle endocrine preparation, can quickly eliminate premature ejaculation and impotence, restore sexual health, and ensure no short-lived effects. At the same time, it invigorates the mind, promotes metabolic function, strengthens muscles, and gives a rosy complexion. This agent is effective in all aspects and can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys in 24 hours. Therefore, its efficacy is the best of all endocrine preparations. "Body-Building Tonic" for women can regulate menstruation and promote fertility.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>The Role of Endocrine Glands in the Body</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>People communicate with each other, and there must be a way for them to communicate. Similarly, there must be a way for the various tissues and organs in the body to communicate with each other. This way is a special chemical component. This component is produced in a certain organ, circulates in the blood, and when it reaches other tissues and organs, it has a significant impact on their function due to chemical action. Often, the action of organ A affects the action of organs B and C. There is mutual communication between them to maintain the unity and harmony of the body's life functions. The one that can perform this important task is Hormon, also known as endocrine, and the name Hormon comes from the Greek root of "awaken" (Opuaw). The reason why it is also called "endocrine" is that the secretions of most glands are sent out of the body through ducts, such as mammary glands and sweat glands, which secrete outwards, and gastric glands and intestinal glands, which secrete inwards. However, endocrine glands are the opposite. They do not have ducts, and their secretions are mostly sent directly into the inside of the body—that is, into the blood, hence the name. Endocrine glands are called endocrine because endocrine secretion occurs in the blood.</p>
<p>A person's intelligence, the development of sexual function, and our well-being all depend on whether the function of the endocrine system is healthy. Therefore, the importance of the position of the endocrine system can be generally seen.</p>
<p>If the endocrine glands lose their normal function, then problems occur in physical development, such as short lower body, dull nerves, lack of memory, scattered spirit, inability to concentrate, and failure in career. Symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and kidney atrophy are also often caused by disorders of endocrine function. "Body-Building Tonic," invented by Dr. Melen, a leading German endocrinologist, is an authority in endocrine preparations. Taking it can correct disorders of endocrine function and restore it to normal, and all sexual diseases and developmental deficiencies caused by endocrine disorders can be cured.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Qi Reversal in Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>If patients with lung disease experience symptoms of Qi reversal, the disease is quite dangerous and has undoubtedly entered the third stage of lung disease. Those who cough up blood are even more seriously affected. Therefore, patients must not ignore it. However, according to my experience, as long as patients can rest quietly, consume nutritious foods, and receive medication, there is no one who will not respond with a miraculous effect of revival.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a patient named Zeng Tianyuan, 24 years old, from Wuxi, who had been suffering from lung disease for more than two years. Although he had taken various Chinese and Western medicines, none of them were effective. Last autumn, he was introduced by a friend to my clinic for treatment. After an X-ray examination, it was found that there were one large and one small cavity in his lungs. He was suffering from severe Qi reversal and profuse night sweats. His condition was very critical. I prescribed "Lung-Nourishing Elixir" and instructed him to rest and recuperate. Three months later, his condition had improved significantly, and after another three months of medication, he recovered.</p>
<h3>Cured Case of Spermatorrhea: Spermatorrhea Should Not Be Treated with Inferior Medicine but Should Be Treated with Proper Therapy</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>A patient named Tang Renji, from Wuxi, 25 years old, (complained) —— at the age of seventeen, he was seduced by bad friends and developed a habit of masturbation, but later he realized the harm and quit. A year later, he went to work in a shop, where he was busy and had no rest all day, so he felt quite tired. Before three months had passed, he suddenly had spermatorrhea in his dreams. At first, it was about once every five or six days, but later it became once every one or two days. He was very flustered, so he read the newspapers and saw that a certain sperm-consolidating pill was being sold. He bought it and took it, and it was indeed effective. He continued to take it for two months, claiming that his spermatorrhea had been completely cured. Unexpectedly, after he stopped taking it, the condition became even worse. During the day when he was working, semen flowed out naturally. He realized that he had been harmed by inferior medicine, etc. (Treatment process) —— Tang Jun's sperm gate was lax, and his endocrine system was deficient. I ordered him to recuperate and prescribed "Nair's Spermatorrhea Pills" and the male testicle essence preparation "Body-Building Tonic" and electric therapy for fifteen minutes every day. After one month of treatment, the spermatorrhea was completely cured. It has been three months now, and the spermatorrhea has never recurred, and his muscles are strong and his body is healthy.</p>
<p>Discussion on Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>The Key to Treating Gonorrhea: Easy or Difficult</h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The differences in the treatment of gonorrhea cannot really be spoken of with a single rule. However, within no rule, there is also a certain rule. What is this rule? It is the scientific rule. Any therapy that conforms to scientific rules makes the treatment of gonorrhea easy. However, ordinary doctors are limited by vulgar views, confined to outdated methods, and do not know to take the initiative to change to the latest scientific methods. Then, even if they have rich experience, it is not enough to take. Because experience does not necessarily have value, because sticking to old methods, even if a doctor has a hundred years of experience, it is not at all valuable, and instead may be ridiculed for being outdated. The difficulty of gonorrhea treatment depends on whether the therapy is reasonable, and at the same time, patients should understand the necessity of recuperating. If these two necessary conditions are met, then any stubborn gonorrhea, no matter how fierce, can eventually be controlled. Otherwise, no matter how experienced any doctor is, if they do not pay attention to the progress of the times, do not know how to use scientifically invented effective gonorrhea medicines, and do not instruct patients on the method of recuperation, the results will inevitably be laborious and without success.</p>
<p>I also have twenty years of history, but I do not belittle generally effective therapies. Based on my many years of research, the result of choosing the best and discarding the worst is that, in terms of oral medicine, the most effective gonorrhea medicine is "Kelimunon". This agent is made of a mixture of protein and yellow pigment and has anti-gonococcus and phagocytic effects. All the gonococci in both new and old gonorrhea, as long as they take "Kelimunon", will be destroyed like a dry branch and rotten wood; they will all be quickly cured. I also use the latest German-invented electrostatic therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum, etc., to treat prostatitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, cystitis, etc. in acute and chronic gonorrhea, and the cure is especially fast.</p>
<p>Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty numbers will be given out every day, with a fee of only five dimes per number, and two volumes of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one dollar will be given as a gift.</p>

<h3>Dangerous Conditions for Barge Passengers on Ningbo Ships; Fellow-Provincials Association Requests Proper Improvement Plans</h3>
<p>Passenger numbers should be limited, and passengers should not be allowed to scramble onto barges; each ship should have iron ladders to facilitate passengers boarding and disembarking.</p>
<p>The Daguan News Agency reports that the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai is requesting improvements in the methods for barging passengers on Ningbo ships in order to emphasize the importance of life. Yesterday, they sent letters to the shipping departments of the German merchant Lihua Yanghang, Far Eastern Shipping Company, Italian merchant Zhongyi Shipping Company, and Yihua Yanghang, etc. The letter states: "We are writing to inform you that, according to a letter from our fellow-provincials as a whole, since the Moufude, Deping, and Hana ships of the upper month's eighth day have all sailed directly between Shanghai and Ningbo, which has made it convenient for our fellow-provincials, these ships are anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai,</p>
<p>Barge Transportation of Passengers</p>
<p>Boarding ships via barge at and after 8:00 PM, in times of darkness and rapid tides, transporting elderly, weak, women and children is inherently extremely dangerous. All these shipping companies only know to greedily take on more passengers, and don't have passenger number limits; before the barge transportation, the majority of passengers wait on the wharfs in Ningbo and Zhenhai, and at the time of barging there is no method to maintain order, which allows the passengers to compete and disembark. Strong and powerful men rush ahead to embark first, and the weak remain overnight at the wharfs for five, six, even ten nights and are still unable to embark. Cases of people who</p>
<p>Exhaust their Resources</p>
<p>unable to return are known. Cases of heatstroke and illness, becoming incapacitated are known; the sounds of sobbing and complaints are unbearable to listen to. During the jostling to board the barge, they push against each other, causing luggage to fall into the water, family members become scattered, shouts and screams, it is horrifying to behold. This unnecessary suffering, the shipping companies should take full responsibility for. There is also a portion of passengers trapped in Zhenhai who, fearing that being slightly late to embark, will find the ship full and be denied boarding, hire ferry boats in advance to board the ships before the Deping departs. Unexpectedly, when sailing near the blockade line outside the mouth, the tidal flow is rapid, resulting in the boats striking the ships and capsizing,</p>
<p>Passengers Drown</p>
<p>More than ten people (see the Ningbo Current Affairs Gazette of August 2nd). The creation of this accidental disaster, the shipping companies' methods are inadequate, resulting in it. It is also heard that during the Deping's barge transport, passengers crowded, with two people falling into the sea and losing their lives (see the Current Affairs Gazette). Learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, each shipping company for the passengers' boarding and disembarking methods outside of Zhenhai mouth, it is naturally necessary to have improvement. Your association serves the country and town and is dedicated to pursuing benefits for our fellow provincials, not neglecting any effort. We dare not be tasteless and forward to your association the actual congestion and inadequate methods of the ships. We must pray that your association in turn write each shipping company, first,</p>
<p>Set Passenger Numbers</p>
<p>in advance, publish it clearly. Passengers must register on the wharfs, the embarking of all the quotas being sufficient, there is a deadline. Those who are not registered may not disembark on the barge. When passengers board and disembark, it is also necessary to thoroughly consider a proper method, maintain order, valuing human life. We cannot bear to be without our hopes," etc. Based on this, investigation reveals that the boat-capsizing tragedy of Shanghai and Ningbo route ships carrying barge passengers has been heard of often. It is urgent to devise methods for improving it, valuing human life. According to the letter of the previous circumstances, we should write and ask you to act soon with</p>
<p>Proper Safety</p>
<p>Methods, to benefit travelers and value human life, the public is grateful." It is also learned that the association is re-informed, by the letter from fellow provincial Wang Dihui, requiring turning to the various companies to comply with the foreign ocean shipping equipment methods, adding several iron open-air ladders of appropriate dimensions at the sides of the ship, to be freely used before and after arriving in port, for passengers' boarding and disembarking. Compared to rope tying, it is no different than heaven and hell. The cost on each ship, at most, is only several hundred yuan, and for passengers' lives, it ensures safe guarantees. The association has also turned this into a letter to the various companies, requesting that they adopt and comply with it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Declares Shutdown; Tianjin Floodwaters Haven't Receded; Passengers and Cargo Quietly Await Disposition</h3>
<p>The Tianjin flood has remained extremely severe as of yesterday. The water level in the Japanese Concession has risen to over thirteen feet. The Japanese side estimates that material losses have reached a staggering four hundred million yen. Furthermore, the railway between Tanggu and Tianjin has been washed away by the floodwaters, causing travelers intending to go from Tianjin to Dagu to be stranded. All foreign ships operating on this line have declared a shutdown due to the Hai River's banks being a vast expanse of water and the navigational channels being indistinguishable. Shipping between Shanghai and Tianjin has been completely blocked. The Swatow of the Taikoo Yanghang, originally docked at the mouth of Tanggu, returned on the 27th without carrying any passengers. This ship will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 31st), and the date of its next departure to Tianjin will depend on the situation of the floods in Tianjin. The Shanghai-based Weili Han Shipping Company, Taikoo Yanghang, Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Taichangxiang Shipping Company, and Weitai Shipping Company's Xinan Na, Xinan Fu, Xinxiangtai, Hongshun, Anshui, Taishun, and Shengjing, etc., after sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin one after another, have been temporarily docked at Dagu, Tanggu, and Zizhu Lin, etc., due to being blocked by the floods. The cargo they carry cannot be unloaded. The companies have announced to their customers that they intend to store the goods at the nearby port of Dalian, according to Article 13 of the bill of lading, with all freight charges still borne by the customers. However, the customers mostly advocate transporting the goods back to Shanghai, so negotiations are still underway with the companies' authorities. As of yesterday, no decision has been made. Therefore, each ship is currently docked at Tianjin, quietly awaiting the company's instructions before sailing to Dalian or returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Staff of the Zhao Feng Park Murder Case; Four Criminals Sentenced Separately; Hua Yi is Also Transferred to the First Court to Face Charges; Guns and Ammunition Await Verification Before Transferring to the French Police</h3>
<p>Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen (aka Qian Xizhen), both from Changzhou, were instigated by their mentor (i.e., the master of the gang) Ren Xiaorong, and persuaded their friend Qin Yuanxing to steal two handguns, over one hundred bullets, and a lighter in the shape of a gun from the residence of their employer, British expatriate Mr. Willington, located at No. 4, Lane 641, Xiafei Road, in the French Concession, on the afternoon of the 16th of this month. They handed them over to Ren's disciple, Ah Gou, to hide them in a room at the Oriental Hotel. Ren, fearing that Qin would reveal the crime afterward,</p>
<p>ordered Chen and Zhou</p>
<p>to lure Qin to the Zhao Feng Park that evening, where they gathered Zhou Wenqing (i.e., Xiezhen's younger brother) and Zhang Xiaoer to strangle his neck with a rope and beat him severely, hoping to silence him by killing him. Qin cried for help, and nearby British soldiers heard the cries and entered the park, capturing Wenqing and Xiaoer. Guoyuan and Xiezhen escaped into the darkness, but were captured by detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station the next day, and the stolen goods were recovered. They were sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Qin Yuanxing, who was beaten severely, was sent to the hospital for treatment. The French Police, because the gun theft occurred in the French Concession, first took Qin to investigate and sent a separate letter to the First Special Court to transfer</p>
<p>the other four criminals</p>
<p>The details of what happened have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke ordered the four criminals, including Chen Guoyuan, to be brought to court for further trial. The French Police also sent detectives to escort Qin Yuanxing to court to testify and requested that the four criminals be handed over to them for further investigation. Judge Meng first questioned Qin Yuanxing about the circumstances of the attack that night. According to Qin, at three or four o'clock in the afternoon on the 16th, Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen came to the apartment, suggesting a walk in Zhao Feng Park. I arrived at the park with Chen at five o'clock. Xiaoer and Xiezhen arrived at seven o'clock, followed by Wenqing, and we sat down to chat, discussing Jinbao introducing me as a lover. Unexpectedly, Guoyuan suddenly took advantage of the dark night when there were no lights and few people, left his seat and approached me from behind</p>
<p>and strangled my neck tightly with a rope. I immediately cried out, and the other three began to beat me fiercely. By the time the British soldiers arrived, I had already lost consciousness. He denied knowing about the theft of the guns and ammunition from his employer. When questioned, Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer only admitted to helping to beat Qin, and said that they did not participate in the rope strangulation. Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen admitted that they used a rope to strangle Qin's neck and ordered Wenqing and Xiaoer to assist in the beating without denying it. However, they claimed that the whole thing was instigated by the runaway mentor Ren Xiaorong, and they dared not disobey his orders, etc. Finally, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, based on the facts of the case and the confessions of the defendants, requested that Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen be punished for</p>
<p>premeditated murder.</p>
<p>as well as the evidence is clear for the remaining two defendants. The lawyer Fan Gang then defended each defendant, and Judge Meng immediately ruled that Chen Guoyuan and Zhou Xiezhen were each sentenced to seven years in prison, and Zhou Wenqing and Zhang Xiaoer were each sentenced to one year and six months in prison. After the sentence was pronounced, the four criminals, along with Qin Yuanxing, were handed over to the personnel from the Second Special District Local Court to be taken back for trial. As for the stolen guns and ammunition, it is said that they must be inspected by the Bureau of Public Works' firearms inspection office before being transferred to the French Police.</p>
<h3>The Black Market for Foreign Exchange Eases; Bond Prices Soar; HSBC Quotes Longer on Foreign Exchange; Black Market Price of Gold Falls</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, the situation in Europe has suddenly become tense, and the financial markets in Shanghai have improved. The black market for foreign exchange has eased, the price of gold has fallen, and bond prices have soared. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday that (1) The black market HSBC quotes suddenly eased, with British exchange at three and a half pence, up two five, and US exchange at six yuan two five, up one eight seven five, with actual market prices of four pence for British exchange and seven yuan zero six two five for US exchange.

<h3>Hua Central Opium Suppression Bureau Intensifies Poisoning, Holds Important Meeting</h3>
<p>After the exposure of the corruption case of "Director-General of the Hua Central Opium Suppression Bureau," Zhu Yao, and due to connections seeking a thorough investigation, Zhu became greatly fearful. He first sought assistance from the puppet "Governor of Jiangsu Province," Chen Zemin. Still fearing that he could not maintain his position, he further pleaded with Liang Hongzhi, crying and lamenting. As Zhu was a close relative of Liang, the thorough investigation was temporarily suspended. Therefore, in order to repay the favor, Zhu actively promoted the policy of poisoning. He recently convened an important meeting with the owners of opium paste shops in various counties at the headquarters on North Sichuan Road. He ordered each opium paste shop owner to sell at least a whole number of units each day, divided into upper, middle, and lower grades. The upper grade was required to sell 200 taels per day, the middle grade 100 taels, and the lower grade 50 taels. Those who violated this regulation would have their public sales licenses revoked. The opium paste shop owners expressed difficulties with this coercive policy and requested a reduction, but Zhu refused. It is reported that this resolution will be implemented starting on the first day of the month.</p>
<h3>Refugee Shelter Staff Embezzles</h3>
<p>Li Xiang (39 years old), a native of Yancheng, Jiangbei, recently worked as the chief of the 13th district at the International Refugee Shelter located at 360 Yanping Road. He managed over 500 refugees, including men, women, children, and the elderly. All entry and exit permits for the refugees in the shelter, as well as cancellations for those returning home and replacements for new refugees, were reported by him to the director, Wang Yangqiao, for review. Li Xiang suddenly became eccentric and defrauded new refugees Yao Wenzhi and Wu Busi, a married woman, of their money. He also altered entry and exit permits for four men and women, obtaining five yuan. This was discovered by the shelter director, Wang Yangqiao, who reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station at 2:15 PM on the 26th.

<p>Policeman's Daughter Accuses Husband of Abandonment</p>
<p>Ding Xiuying, a 21-year-old woman from Hebei, who lived at 15, 176 Lane, Chongqing Road, and whose father is currently a policeman, was married to Zhang Fengming (28 years old this year), also from her hometown, through a matchmaker three years ago. However, the couple only lived together for half a year before Zhang left and abandoned his wife. The woman was forced to live with her mother for three years. If this continued, she would not have lifelong happiness. Therefore, Ding Xiuying filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against her husband, Zhang Fengming, accusing him of abandonment and requesting a legal investigation. After reviewing the complaint, the court opened the Second Criminal Court for trial yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The defendant, Zhang Fengming, failed to appear in court. Only the plaintiff, Ding Xiuying, appeared in court to testify about the defendant's abandonment. The court advised the plaintiff that the situation in this case was not of great importance to criminal matters and could be resolved through civil procedures to resolve the marital relationship. As a result, because the plaintiff insisted on arresting and interrogating the defendant, the court ordered a suspension of the trial and would proceed with the trial when the defendant appeared in court.</p>

<h3>Finance: British and American Exchange Rates Diverge; British Exchange Rate Once Reached Four Pence; American Dollar Actually Contracted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market was open as usual after the holiday. The HSBC posted rates showed that the British exchange rate rose by 0.025, reaching 0.035 pence, while the American exchange rate rose by 0.1875, reaching 6.25 yuan. Other rates also generally increased. The British and American exchange rates suggested that the inter-exchange rate between Britain and America had sharply contracted by 0.11 to 0.225 yuan compared to last Saturday. The morning opening showed a British stable and American weak scenario, with the British gold rate at 0.03875 pence and the American exchange rate at only 6.9375 yuan. Later, due to selling pressure from the China Bank and China Merchants Bank, as well as slight sales from Hong Kong Electric and the Japanese Bank, and sluggish buying interest from foreign banks, the market was listless. Subsequently, under selling pressure, the situation hardened, and the rate increased to the 0.04 pence level. However, HSBC had unlimited buying interest at the 0.04 pence British gold rate, so the decline was blocked. Afterwards, China Merchants Bank and others, seeing HSBC's strong buying interest, also started to buy, so the situation slightly softened. As a result, the British rate loosened by 0.0625, while the American rate contracted by 0.1875. The futures market was also very calm, with trends similar to the spot market. Trading in the spot and futures markets was very quiet throughout the day due to large investors remaining on the sidelines.</p>
<p>HSBC Posted Rates Generally Increased</p>
<p>In the morning, the London rate for large amounts recently contracted by 0.09375, and the forward rate decreased by 0.011875 pence. The New York silver price slightly decreased by 0.03625. The London spot gold price surged by 0.106 pounds. The exchange rate between British and American currencies fell by 0.21 yuan, rose by 0.025 yuan against Shanghai, and fell by 0.12 yuan against France. The American exchange rate fell by 0.2025 yuan against British currency, rose by 1.05 yuan against Shanghai, and decreased by 0.001125 yuan against France. All of the above were adjusted according to the exchange rate before customs duties. The Central Bank posted rates remained the same. The morning opening selling price for spot goods was 0.03875 pence for British gold and 6.9375 yuan for the American exchange rate, which was stable for the British rate and tight for the American rate compared to last Saturday. This was due to the continued decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, due to sales from Hong Kong Electric and the China Bank, and poor buying interest from foreign banks, the trend weakened. Hong Kong Electric and the China Bank sold spot British gold to foreign banks such as HSBC and China Banking Corporation at 0.04 pence. Soon, the Japanese Bank also sold spot British gold to a certain bank, still at 0.04 pence. When the HSBC posted rates were announced, the British exchange rate surged by 0.025, the American exchange rate rose by 0.1875, and other exchange rates also increased. After the announcement of the silver balancing tax, the rates were posted as tax-exempt. After this, the situation became very quiet, and the trend was also flat. Hong Kong Electric and the China Bank sold spot American exchange rate at 7 yuan and 7.125 yuan to a certain bank and China Banking Corporation. Later at noon, a certain bank sold September British gold at 0.0375 pence to China Merchants Bank. By the closing at noon, the bank's spot selling price was 0.0396875 pence for British gold and 7.0625 yuan for the American exchange rate, which was 0.0009375 pence higher for the British rate and 0.00125 yuan higher for the American rate compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>British Gold Stabilized Slightly in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The afternoon situation remained very quiet, and trading was very sluggish. It was reported that Hong Kong Electric resold spot British gold at 0.04 pence and 0.0396875 pence, and spot American exchange rate at 7.0615 yuan to foreign banks such as HSBC. Afterwards, China Merchants Bank and foreign firms bought spot British gold at 0.039375 pence from foreign banks, causing the market to soften slightly. By the closing in the evening, the bank's spot selling price was 0.039375 pence for British gold and 7 yuan for the American exchange rate. The September British gold rate was 0.0365625 pence and the American exchange rate was 6.375 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot and September British rates both loosened by 0.000625, while the American rate contracted by 0.001875.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Exchange Market Was Unstable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, August 29th: The exchange market opened this morning without any telegrams from Shanghai. At 10:00 AM, the market was extremely unstable. The first telegram indicated that the spot British exchange rate was 0.0003125 tighter than yesterday's closing, at 1.290625 yuan, while the spot American exchange rate sharply contracted by 0.08125, at 26.5 yuan. There were no reports on the forward rates. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 6 yuan, to 334 yuan. At 10:20 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 16 yuan, to 350 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate remained unchanged, at 106 yuan. At 10:35 AM, the market remained unstable. The spot British exchange rate continued to tighten by 0.0003125, to 1.2875 yuan. The forward rate opened at 1.278125 yuan, which was also 0.0003125 tighter than yesterday's closing. The spot American exchange rate loosened by 0.00375, to 26.875 yuan. There was no market for the forward rate. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by 8 yuan, to 358 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the British, American, and Shanghai exchange rates remained unchanged. The Japanese exchange rate loosened by 2 yuan, to 108 yuan. At the noon closing, the spot American exchange rate loosened by 0.0009375, to 1.296875 yuan. The forward rate remained unchanged. The American exchange rate remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate rose again by 12 yuan, to 370 yuan. The market opened at 2:30 PM. The British and Shanghai exchange rates remained unchanged. The spot American exchange rate contracted by 0.00125, to 26.75 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate tightened by 2 yuan, remaining at 106 yuan. There were no changes until the closing. The spot Shanghai exchange rate fluctuated by 36 yuan, and rose by 30 yuan compared to yesterday's closing.</p>
<h3>British Pure Gold Repeatedly Reached Unprecedented High Prices; Cash Market in Shanghai Inevitably Increased</h3>
<p>The 4,000 Yuan Mark Was Once Breached</p>
<p>The situation in the cash market yesterday, which was actively traded in the dark, opened weak in the morning but then rebounded sharply. The market sentiment was firm. After the 4,000 yuan mark was breached, it retreated again. This was because the sentiment was originally weak, and the news that the British gold rate had reached the 0.04 pence level caused strong selling pressure, especially from a certain money exchange business, which sold heavily. In addition, buyers remained on the sidelines, causing the morning opening to fall to a low of 3,930 yuan. Subsequently, retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy heavily, and Hong Kong investors also showed strong buying interest due to the easing of the situation in the region. Although securities firms tried to sell at that time, they still felt that the supply was insufficient. The price surged to 4,080 yuan. The noon closing retreated to 4,065 yuan. The afternoon opening was still flat. Soon, a certain jewelry store resumed active buying on behalf of Hong Kong investors, and securities firms also turned from sellers to buyers. In addition, the foreign exchange rate slightly softened, causing another leap to a peak of 4,135 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm took advantage of the high prices to cash in, causing a slight decline. The closing price was 4,105 yuan, which was 80 yuan higher than last Saturday. Trading volume throughout the day was about 1,000 taels. Gold jewelry stores also saw prices rise sharply, with prices for Customs Order gold and Chinese-British pure gold surging and reaching unprecedented highs.</p>
<p>Actively Traded Cash Increased by 80 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened low due to weak sentiment and news that the British exchange rate had reached the 0.04 pence level, which caused sellers to rush to the market, especially a certain money exchange business acting on behalf of local investors. The opening was 95 yuan lower than last Saturday, or 140 yuan lower than the off-market price on the previous day. A money exchange business sold 30 taels to a certain gold firm at a price of 3,930 yuan. After the opening, the market sentiment stabilized and there was frequent absorption by brokers who saw the price as cheap. While a certain gold firm still had buying interest, securities firms frequently came to sell, but the demand still exceeded the supply, and the price rose. Soon, it surged by 140 yuan. A money exchange business bought 20 taels from a gold firm at a price of 4,070 yuan. Afterwards, securities firms sold again, and buyers reduced their buying interest, lowering the price by 30 yuan. A securities firm sold 10 taels to a cash firm at 4,040 yuan. At that time, Hong Kong investors strongly supported a certain jewelry store's aggressive buying of more than 200 taels. Although a certain gold firm sold, the trend continued to rise. Soon, it rose by 40 yuan. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to a money exchange business for 4,080 yuan. Later, jewelry stores frequently sold, and Hong Kong investors stopped buying, causing the price to gradually fall by 40 yuan. Jewelry stores sold 30 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 4,040 yuan. At the time, a certain money exchange business aggressively bought dozens of taels, causing it to rise by 35 yuan. A money exchange business traded 50 taels mutually at 4,075 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm sold 10 taels to a jewelry store, causing the price to fall back by 15 yuan to 4,060 yuan. Then, a cash firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange business for 4,065 yuan, setting the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the first transaction was a mutual trade between money exchange businesses for 10 taels, and the price was still 4,065 yuan. Soon, a certain jewelry store started another buying spree, and securities firms and a certain money exchange business followed suit, and the foreign exchange rate slightly softened, and sellers' intentions were weak, causing it to surge by 70 yuan. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange business for 4,135 yuan. Later, the wind of rising was thwarted because a certain gold firm liquidated profits, and it fell by 30 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange business for 4,105 yuan, setting the evening closing price. The result was that the active trade rose 80 yuan compared to the holiday before (last Saturday). The price of cash firm's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the actively traded gold, and the current bid gold was 65 yuan lower than the posted gold, and few deals were concluded.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Posted at 415 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate of gold jewelry per tael also turned from falling to rising. Datong Trading Company was at 9.5 yuan, which was 405 yuan. At 9:45, it rose 5 yuan, and at 2:30 PM, it rose another 5 yuan, reaching 415 yuan. Xintong Trading Company initially fell to 403 yuan, then rose back to 413 yuan (the take-back price was about 20 yuan lower), all rising by 5 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Rose Again by 6 Shillings</p>
<p>The Central Bank posted rates showed that the Customs Order gold surged violently, soaring by 0.172 yuan, reaching an unprecedented peak of 2.601 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price surged by 85.4 yuan, exceeding the 1,300 yuan mark, reaching 1,309.2 yuan. The Chinese pure gold buying price rose accordingly, reaching 1,313.9 yuan. This was because during the Confucius birthday holiday, the European situation became increasingly critical. World War II was about to break out, causing great shock in the London market. The British pound lacked support and was extremely weak. All parties were selling off British pounds and buying pure gold as much as possible, resulting in a surge of 0.46 pounds on the 26th and a further surge of 0.6 pounds on the 28th. The two days totaled 1.06 pounds (or 126 pence), rising to an unprecedented peak of 8.1 pounds.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Sharply Contracted: London, August 28th - The silver market suddenly moved in the opposite direction, falling sharply. Indian and speculative merchants sold, and there was a lack of support, causing the recent rate to sharply contract by 0.09375 and the forward rate to contract by 0.010625, both retreating to around the 0.19 pence level. After the market closed, the situation stabilized. A few buyers quoted the posted price. A telegram from New York stated that the American silver spot price was still falling sharply by 0.013625, retreating to 0.36125. A telegram from Mumbai stated that the Indian silver spot and October rates both contracted by 0.03 rupees, while the September rate contracted by 0.01 rupees. A total of 100 contracts were traded, and the market situation was calm.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Fell Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange fell slightly, hovering around 177.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan throughout the day, without significant fluctuations. It fell by 2.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. The money industry association's call rate remained unchanged, posting 0.18 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>British and Australian Gold Tickets Rebounded</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds were first weak and then firm, but the results were not stable. Although the British gold ticket exchange rate loosened again, there was hope for peace in the current situation. The market sentiment was optimistic, and the market situation was firm and bullish. There was not much demand for American gold tickets, and the posted rate was slightly higher, and the market situation was slightly loose. Hong Kong tickets rebounded due to the easing of the border situation and stable public sentiment, and the market price rebounded. Singapore and Annam tickets did not see demand and all turned downward. Australian remaining tickets fell too violently last week, and now peace has not been completely abandoned, and the market situation is firm and rebounding. Japanese gold tickets were first weak and then firm, and the results were not very glorious. The evening market was 1.165 yuan. Korean tickets are scarce and the market is very popular. The evening market was 1.05 yuan. Yesterday's market price was British gold ticket up 2 yuan, American gold ticket down 0.05 yuan, Hong Kong ticket up 0.2 yuan, Singapore Cai down 0.1 yuan, Annam ticket down 0.2 yuan, Han gold ticket up 5 yuan, and other currencies were not changed.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Sound of Bidding Prices Filled the Market; The Decline in Cotton Yarn Continued</h3>
<p>Double Horse Plummeted by 45 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is fierce. This is because actual sales were weak. Hong Kong investors depreciated the Hong Kong dollar. Moreover, Guang investors absorbed a large amount, resulting in a stalemate in the market. The Hong Kong investors first removed their own goods and rushed to install them to avoid losses. Therefore, they did not intend to try to buy the goods of the yarn companies. As a result, the chips were loose, and those who shouted to sell came one after another. The past mutual high bids have changed into everyone pressing down and rushing to make a first offer. Therefore, the decline of Double Horse was the most tragic. In fact, it is the cycle of heaven. Such an increase is like such a decrease. The price of 210 thread Double Horse plummeted by 45 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The opening situation of the current yarn market in the morning was poor. Because the Japanese cabinet resigned and the black market for foreign exchange loosened significantly, colleagues gathered to observe the situation and moved slowly. It did not open until 9:05 AM, because of the lack of actual sales. Later, the opening price fell by 30 yuan. The factory price of Double Horse was 595 yuan, and the spot price was 670 yuan, a drop of 35 yuan. Afterwards, there were still no sales, and it fell another 9 yuan. The factory price rose slightly by a few yuan due to purchases from colleagues, reaching 600 yuan. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were only 714 bales. The market prices were Double Horse down 43 yuan, Heavenly Girl down 34 yuan, and Two Earths down 20 yuan. Today, 35 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 30 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amount purchased by each investor is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Sagging Yarn Prices Make the Cotton Market Even Quieter</h3>
<p>Current cotton trading remains quiet. Factories need to clear their inventory, mainly because yarn prices continue to fall significantly by thirty to forty yuan. Manufacturers have no interest in high-priced raw materials. Furthermore, new cotton from various regions is continuously entering the market, but transportation to Shanghai remains difficult. Prices at the origin are relatively cheaper. The supply from northern Jiangsu continues smoothly, with 446 bales arriving in Tongzhou. Regarding spot cotton, only the Japanese-owned Dakang Factory imported 200 pieces of "Dala" cotton, priced at 132 yuan, with payment in banknotes made directly to the factory.</p>
<p>In other news, regarding Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, factories' enthusiasm is low due to the recent slump in yarn prices, so no deals have been reported. Recently, the price of pure gold in London has soared, and the customs gold unit has also risen from 3.396 yuan to 2.60 yuan, equivalent to an increase of over 0.5 yuan per picul of raw cotton. There are rumors in the market that customs duties will increase starting in September, so cotton merchants are generally unwilling to sell at low prices.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market opened with a drop due to a telegram from Bombay, leading to the liquidation of long positions. U.S. stock prices were weak due to the tense situation in Europe, significantly impacting the New York cotton market. Speculators were aggressively selling. Yesterday's market price remained weak throughout the day, and the closing price was over 20 points lower than the previous day. However, all European cotton markets rose. India, including forecasts, rose by over one rupee, Egypt rose by over 20 points, and Liverpool rose by over one point.</p>
<h3>New Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cotton Enters the Market</h3>
<p>Special dispatch: New "Yao" cotton from Zhejiang has already entered the market in large quantities. Due to the suspension of German merchant ships, it should arrive in Shanghai soon. In areas such as Taicang and Jiading along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, the weather has been favorable this year, and new cotton is growing vigorously, so it has entered the market earlier than in previous years. The local selling price there is 85 yuan, and sales have already begun.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Restrictions on Imports to the Interior, Reduction of Cloth Sales Tax</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Since the National Government gradually strengthened the management of trade and foreign exchange, cotton cloth imported from Shanghai to the interior has been subject to strict restrictions, such as lowering selling prices, raising exchange rates, and implementing a procurement permit system. As a result, various merchant guilds face operating difficulties, and sales have sharply declined. According to news from the Ningbo guild, there is talk of an additional tax of two yuan per piece (calculated at 40 yards) starting on September 1st. Merchant guilds have little interest in purchasing and stockpiling cloth, and there is a willingness to sell off goods with the market. The market shows signs of softening, but factory costs are increasing daily. It is unlikely that the market will continue to decline. Yesterday, white and colored cloths were generally weak, with opening prices largely unchanged. However, small amounts of hand goods were resold by merchant guilds, resulting in price reductions of 0.1 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Selling prices were chaotic. Over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and velvet were traded on this street. The Ningbo guild handled sixty to seventy boxes of colored twill, blue cloth, serge, and broadcloth. The Guangdong guild handled over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, undyed cloth, and yarn. The Sichuan, Yunnan, and Southeast Asian guilds only added small amounts of goods. Wholesale business in this street's stores and in the guerrilla areas of the interior has uniformly declined.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>The white cloth market continues to soften, with fine cloth falling another 0.1 to 0.15 yuan per piece. The current price of "Dragon Head" fine cloth is 17.60 yuan. However, "Flying Fish" 12-pound fine cloth was collected by buyers on this street, with over 100 bales traded, rising from 16.95 yuan to 17.10 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands uniformly declined. Fine twill is relatively firm. Brands such as "Blue Double Fish" and "Baby" are continuously needed by dye factories on this street, so the price is stable.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Piece goods scheduled for export today include 70 pieces to Hong Kong, 30 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 7 pieces to Haikou, 3 pieces to Beihai, and 15 pieces to Xiamen. However, whether they can be exported at that time depends on the wind conditions.</p>
<h3>Grain: New and Old Grain Arrive in Large Quantities, Rice Prices Plummet, Merchants Sell Off at a Loss, High-Quality Indica Rice Opens at 35 Yuan</h3>
<p>"Du" Rice: Since the influx of new grain from various regions caused prices to plummet, they have fallen by about 7 yuan from the highest prices. If the inflow of new grain continues unabated, the market may continue to decline. Yesterday, although only Songjiang No. 6 rice arrived from the riverine areas, over 10,000 bags of new and old grain of various grades arrived from the "cartwheel" and "baozi" regions, causing further market anxiety. Most people are struggling. Stores on this street are watching from the sidelines, and brokers are also standing by, resulting in a stagnant situation. Generally, merchants are unanimously and aggressively selling off their goods in an attempt to quickly get rid of them, but it is still difficult to attract interest. As a result, high-quality japonica rice fell by more than 3 yuan, and ordinary early and late season rice fell by more than 4 yuan. The price reduction for old and new "Jian" rice was particularly severe, with the lowest reaching 9 yuan. However, the total volume of transactions in the city was less than 3,000 to 4,000 bags. High-quality Xixi japonica rice traded at 35 yuan, 34 yuan, and Sutong-Kun japonica rice traded at 34 yuan, down to 32 yuan. Riverine early and late season rice traded at 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and original bags traded at 30 yuan, 31.5 yuan. Old "Lu Jian" traded at 30 yuan, 29.5 yuan, new "Chuan Jian" traded at 28 yuan, and lower grades traded at 25 yuan. "Bian Yuan" traded at 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and "Yin Yuan" traded at 25 yuan. Old "Yang Jian" traded at 32 yuan, and new "Yang Jian" traded at 28 yuan, 27 yuan. "Tuan Jian" traded at 29 yuan, 28 yuan, and "Du Jian" traded at 27 yuan. 100 bags of "Cha" rice are being shipped to Xiamen today.</p>
<p>Customer Indica Rice: Yesterday's supply was particularly abundant, with 7,000 to 8,000 bags of new and old indica rice arriving from northern Jiangsu, Wuhu, and Nanjing. There are rumors that restrictions are gradually easing, and the flow of goods has not been as repeatedly blocked as it was a few days ago. Furthermore, it is rumored that grain merchants' requests to transport large quantities of rice have been approved. Market sentiment is unanimously downward, and the newly arrived indica rice from northern Jiangsu is particularly eager to be sold off at reduced prices. Yesterday's high-end rice traded at only 28.5 yuan, with mid-range prices ranging from 27 yuan to 25 yuan. High-end Beijing indica traded at 31 yuan, and Wuhu indica traded at 30 yuan, with lower grades trading at around 26 yuan, a decline of 3 to 4 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Returned Flour Continues to Weaken, Lower Than Factory Prices by 0.2 Yuan, Wheat Prices Fall, Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market continued to show signs of softening. Although factory prices remained stable, returned goods gradually weakened. Currently, they are 0.1 yuan lower than factory prices. Scattered buyers in the interior slightly absorbed flour at low prices, but actual sales on this street sharply declined due to the drop in rice prices. As a result, returned goods remained abundant, with prices only at 6.15 yuan to 6.1 yuan, a further decline of several points. The total volume of transactions in the city was estimated at 20,000 bags. Trading was extremely quiet due to windy and rainy conditions. Today, 3,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's price decline was particularly severe, mainly because arrivals have been continuous in recent days. Factories were initially hesitant to purchase due to the sharp drop in rice prices and the sluggish flour sales on this street. Furthermore, the Northern Ocean merchant guilds were affected by the floods, making sales prospects bleak. Therefore, factories' demand for raw materials was very low. Seeing the unfavorable situation, customers actively reduced prices to sell off flour, which triggered factories' opportunistic buying. As a result, prices fell, and sales increased. It is estimated that the "Fu" and "Fu" factories jointly handled over 40,000 bags of wheat from Beijing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and Suzhou, with the highest price at 9.1 yuan, down to 8 yuan, a decline of about 0.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Continue to Rise, Foreign Bonds Mixed</h3>
<p>The securities market's off-exchange trading showed a continued bullish trend yesterday, with increasing buying interest. Some believe that the cause is the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. In reality, a military cabinet is no different from replacing a cow with a sheep. It is unlikely to change its old ways. However, the recent rapid changes in the world situation, as seen in the attitudes of Britain and Japan after the German-Soviet rapprochement, have been drastically different. Therefore, there are rumors of a peaceful atmosphere, although it is too early to say. However, it is necessary to guard against a similar strategy of Germany and the Soviet Union, striking like lightning. Short sellers in the government bond market are already feeling apprehensive. Therefore, even if market prices fluctuate, they will eventually rise in a curve. The opening saw "Mao Tai" raise prices to buy in, followed by "Tong Kang," "Da Kang," and "Heng Fu" selling off and falling by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Later, "Yong Kang" took advantage of the low prices to absorb a large amount, and "Da Feng Lian He" also made significant purchases. The sellers were mainly scattered retail investors, apart from "Hong Kang Lian Yi." As a result, the final rise was still significant, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 yuan. In the afternoon, prices continued to rise by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan but failed to stabilize. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 150 shares of "Huashang Electrical" were traded at 5.3 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai Public Industry Association reported that the stock market is still dominated by the European situation. Coupled with the complexity of this settlement, the public's interest is generally lacking. In the afternoon, the market slightly improved, with several thousand shares of "Yihe Yarn Factory" being traded at around 18 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market quotations for British-owned Far Eastern companies in London on the 28th of this month (Monday) were sluggish with little change. Only "Gulag Rubber" slightly fell by 1.5 pence, to 15 shillings and 7.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged. Gulag Lin Pang 15/7 1/2 down 0.1/2.</p>
<p>London's Chinese foreign debt market quotations for the 28th of this month (Monday) showed mixed ups and downs. British-German continuation (British issuance) and British-French (British issuance) each rose by 2 pounds, with the former at 41 pounds and the latter at 40 pounds. The "Crespo" loan rose by 1 pound, to 18.5 pounds. The "Rehabilitation" loan and the "Shanghai-Nanjing Railway" loan each fell by 1 pound, with the former at 25 pounds and the latter at 12 pounds (according to the telegram from the 23rd, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway loan fell from 13 pounds to 8.5 pounds due to a coding error. This is a correction). The "Tianjin-Pukou" original British issuance fell by 1.5 pence, and the "Tianjin-Pukou" original German issuance and the "Tianjin-Pukou" continuation British issuance each fell by 2 pounds, with prices all at 10 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Tea Prices Do Not Fall</h3>
<p>In the past two days, the sales of foreign-owned green tea have been very sluggish due to the tense situation in Europe. The trading of various green teas, especially ordinary "Zhenmei," is the most stagnant. Only a few "Chouxin Zhenmei" have been sold. Although "Xiamu Zhucha" is relatively active, the market is not as good as before. Market sentiment is weak, and tea prices have uniformly decreased. Yesterday, only "Tongfu Baochang" and other firms bought "Zhucha" and "Zhenmei," totaling over 180 boxes. "Zhucha" sold for 385 yuan, "Zhenmei" sold for 240 yuan, and "Chouzhen" sold for 346 yuan. The market has fallen by 50 to 60 yuan compared to before, and it may be difficult to stabilize in the future.</p>

<h3>Soaring Prices and Wage Increases</h3>
<p>— Mangmang</p>
<p>Since the slogan of "United Front" was shouted, everyone concentrated on dealing with the war of resistance, and the class struggle has long been stopped. Laborers are enduring under the conditions of being able to maintain the minimum standard of living. And the capitalists do not oppress the workers as they used to. In the two years of the War of Resistance, the situation of labor-capital coordination has never been seen before.</p>
<p>In recent months, because of the special status of Shanghai, the soaring prices have made people breathless. This has a huge impact on the laborers. The compensation obtained by the laborers was originally to maintain the minimum standard of living, but now the standard of living has suddenly increased sharply. This can be solved by "reducing expenditure" in the middle and upper classes, but laborers have no "expenditure" to "reduce," and now even struggling is impossible. Fortunately, the capitalists are well aware of the righteousness and understand the difficulties of the suffering masses, and have taken the initiative to increase wages (as mentioned in this publication the day before yesterday), and the question is easily resolved. On the one hand, it is that capitalists gradually understand the true meaning of "United Front"; and on the other hand, they also understand that the result of oppressing laborers, in addition to unfortunate conflicts, will also cause social unrest, thereby affecting the stable life of capitalists. Therefore, the act of increasing wages automatically is not only beneficial to the War of Resistance, but also beneficial to the capitalists themselves.</p>
<p>However, there are still a few capitalists who remain in the pre-war stage, taking a short-sighted view of their own interests and refusing to agree to the laborers' request for wage increases, which has led to unfortunate disturbances such as the Ruyi factory strike, which is very regrettable. However, there is no fundamental conflict in this. There is still a bit of misunderstanding. Laborers should be able to avoid using drastic measures and argue reasonably in good faith; and if capitalists can make concessions within a possible range, the gap between labor and capital will be eliminated.</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for capitalists to accept, the demands put forward by the laborers may be dynamic, not fixed. In other words, increasing or decreasing remuneration according to the level of the standard of living is beneficial to both parties. For capitalists, a lower standard of living can proportionally reduce wages, so that there will not always be a larger expenditure. For laborers, when the standard of living rises again in the future, wages can also be increased proportionally again, without having to re-raise the request and cause trouble.</p>
<p>Below, I will suggest a few methods that I have thought of for social reference.</p>
<p>(1) The method of increasing wages should not be distributed according to the proportion of the amount of salary. Methods such as adding 10 yuan to those with 100 yuan and adding 1 yuan to those with 10 yuan are completely useless, because the people who are in difficulty are originally the people in the small salary class, so it should be based on the minimum living expenses as the standard, and it is reasonable to add to those with low salaries. (2) Wage increases may be based on the level of rice prices, because what constitutes the living elements of laborers is rice! (3) If you are unwilling to increase wages, you can use the rice subsidy method. The original salary amount is not increased, and a subsidy is added to the salary according to the rice market.</p>
<p>(5) The capital side purchases a large amount of rice and resells it to the laborers at the lowest price (avoiding hoarding, speculation, and profiteering).</p>
<p>(5) The capital side directly provides laborers with food and accommodation, allowing the families of laborers to move to the interior and maintain their family life with their original salaries.</p>
<p>(6) Thoroughly eliminate exploitation between labor and capital.</p>
<p>These conditions may be considered as an additional expense from the capital side, and the income on the labor side may not be as good as before. Therefore, labor and capital are not hostile to each other. On the contrary, labor and capital have a common hostile person, and the War of Resistance is to eliminate such obstacles. The sincere cooperation between labor and capital is to stabilize the country and help the War of Resistance. Then, for the sake of future freedom and happiness, both labor and capital must temporarily endure and solve the current difficulties without expanding them.</p>
<h3>Tears from the West</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>History is the supreme treasure of the human world. If you are nurtured by national history to save the country, you will have a strong and unyielding spirit of unity. If you are a scientist who knows the history of science in detail, you can achieve inventions. The "Shen Bao" is the oldest daily in Chinese history. Great figures in the West, such as Wilson of the United States, achieved their life's work from political history; such as Dr. Colijn, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, a generation of authority traces back to economic history. The use of history is too numerous to mention. On a smaller scale, as for oneself, because of not forgetting the past, it is easier to solve the difficulties and setbacks of the second half of life, so Zhao Shi has helped my ability and spirit. I am grateful for the hard struggle of life, from the past to the present, and I will never forget the past of Mao Yi, who sacrificed himself to exchange experience for me in the lane 20 years ago. On the 20th anniversary of Mao Yi's death, I composed 20 seven-character quatrains. This is the painful history of the past, which is the foundation of my life's learning, and I advise my compatriots across the country not to lose heart if they suffer pain. You must know that the more painful the spirit, the stronger it is, and only with the strongest spirit can you achieve great success. October 14th, 27th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>A mound floats outside the misty autumn smoke,</p>
<p>Ten thousand emotions sob before the setting sun,</p>
<p>I bitterly remember the place of heartbreak in the West,</p>
<p>Twenty years of regret are paid to the abyss.</p>
<p>The place of heartbreak refers to the Lankenau Girls' School on 22nd Street in Philadelphia, the old capital of the United States, where Mao Yi died in the seventh year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Lotus Pavilion and Orchid Oar, I ask about the old traces,</p>
<p>Water flows out of Yongjin Gate,</p>
<p>A broken dream remains where the green mountains are missing,</p>
<p>Hang a late bell when the blue sea withers.</p>
<p>In the sixth year before the beginning of the Republic of China, in the year of Bingwu, I met Mao Yi on a yacht in the Hu Mansion on the edge of the Lotus Fragrance Residence by the West Lake.</p>
<p>Qiannan is as dangerous as Hangu Pass,</p>
<p>I got several bends of the road in the setting sun,</p>
<p>Green leaves are like tides, yellow leaves are like rain,</p>
<p>The whip silk and temple shadows are between the tribute chapters.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the fifth year before the Republic of China, in the year of Dingwei, I followed my father-in-law, Lian Zhai Mingfu, south to take up a new post. The following autumn, I forked and traveled north with my entourage. The whip silk and temple shadows were reflected among the overlapping mountains and peaks. Mao Yi rode in a sedan chair, and I and my brothers Zhi Xiang rode horses, enjoying the scenery of Qiannan. This feeling will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Hundreds of miles of baskets and wide eyes,</p>
<p>Teenage tours of Jiangshan city,</p>
<p>What is worth remembering in life,</p>
<p>Firecrackers and bright lights under Ganzhou.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth year before the Republic of China, in the year of Wushen, I was newly appointed as the principal of An Yuan, and I immediately packed my bags and went to Ganzhou to manage the Wen Lai. On the eve of the fifth day of the New Year, I arrived at the government city. Along the way, there were firecrackers and bright lights, as if welcoming distant guests. On the way back, I traveled in the mountains in a sedan chair. The wind and snow were heavy. After returning to the Yishou, Lian Zhai Zhang and Duanmu Juchu Fu cared for me so much. Good times do not come again, and the impression is profound.</p>
<p>The ancient gate and idle government office have no barking dogs,</p>
<p>I lingered in Sanjiang to avoid the summer,</p>
<p>How extreme is the feeling on this night,</p>
<p>The bright moon shines on thousands of homes and brocade windows.</p>
<p>In the second year before the Republic of China, in the year of Gengxu, Lang Xian Xian.</p>
<p>Uncle Yue Yong took office as Sima of Sanjiang, and I wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>To spend the rest of the summer, I went to Cao'e River for a tour. (Unfinished)</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Overseas rumors suddenly greet Taoye, a strange scene in the fire turns into a lotus flower.</p>
<p>Do you know who this person is? It is this Chinese student who studied in France who succeeded. Sure enough, Alice had a headache this day and had already fallen asleep. Moreover, because her mother had gone out, the house was quiet and she slept soundly. It was not until the fire trucks came on the road and there was a lot of noise that her sweet dream was awakened. In fact, there were many neighbors on the fifth floor, and they had all escaped. Wouldn't they wake up Alice? They had no sense of public morality and only cared about their own lives? That's not true. They thought that Alice and her mother had gone out, and Alice's cancellation of the concert was a temporary one. They also saw that the lights in her room were dark, and they thought that her mother and daughter were not at home. Alice woke up from her dream, and fortunately, her bedroom was facing the road. When she looked at the situation on the road, she knew that there was a fire. She didn't know where the fire was, because the fire on the third floor was behind their house. She quickly ran to the elevator without putting on her clothes, but no one was opening the elevator and no one was answering the bell. She quickly ran to the steps, and just as she went down a floor, she saw a cloud of thick smoke rolling up the stairs and hitting Alice's face, making it impossible to open her eyes. Alice screamed sharply and knew that the fire was in the apartment. Suddenly, she thought of the escape door. Going out from the Taipingmen and going downstairs, there was still a spiral staircase, and all the chances of survival were only in this line. She opened the Taipingmen and looked down, shouting: Ah! Only half of the spiral staircase was left, and the bottom was broken. She still ran back to her bedroom, opened the window, and wanted to jump down. But how could she jump down from the high building on the fifth floor? Jumping down would also break her hands and feet and burst her brains. At that time, she was wearing a snow-white long gauze nightgown, with jade-snow-like feet bare, and black hair as fluffy as dark clouds, dragging on her head, neck, and back, kneeling on the ground and praying. She had to wait for the fire to burn her body, and there was no other way. She also thought in her heart: If it weren't for the headache, I would have gone to the concert with my mother long ago. It was also my fate to suffer this tragic disaster, so I was left here alone. I wonder if my mother is still at the concert at this moment? When you come out, your daughter will have become scorched wood. Lord! Have mercy on me, an innocent daughter! While she was praying silently, she saw a person rushing in from the window. She couldn't see clearly who it was. She only saw him walk up to her and gently and skillfully hold Alice in his arms. He attached to her ear and said: 'Miss Alice! I'm here! Your mother is so anxious, let's go down!" (175)</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Automobile School</h3>
<p>— A Person Who Has Been There</p>
<p>Twenty Days of Vacation a Month, What to Learn? After a Year of Practice, I Still Don't Dare to Take the Exam</p>
<p>In order to acquire some skills during the summer vacation, I resolutely went to ×× Automobile School to register after the big exam. I was learning to drive. In addition to the 32 yuan tuition fee, the license fee cost 8.3 yuan, and other miscellaneous fees were not included. The driving location is in the western suburbs of Shanghai, for the convenience of time, every day. After the car arrives at the designated location, anyone can go up and drive. However, an old car that can no longer be broken can accommodate up to six people. After you compete, the strong ones naturally occupy the seats, and the weak me has to watch them drive away. One car...two cars, it wasn't until the last car that I had my seat. Although it was said at the time of registration that you could drive every 20 minutes, in fact, no trip exceeded 10 minutes. Moreover. There are so many holidays that it is difficult to count. In addition to Sundays and anniversaries, holidays in the abolished calendar must also be taken off according to school rules. There are also unexpected price days, such as rainy days and car damage. Sometimes, in order to break a tire, you have to rest for half a day to a day, allowing students to be exposed to the sun on the road. They never come to inform you. If there is any damage to the inside of the car, it is not uncommon to take several days off in a row, so they often use Daodian to save their gasoline. Like the windy and rainy days these two days, they are exactly what they want. There are at least 20 days a month when you don't drive. Can you still practice so skillfully? Let's take myself as an example. I'm not good at being smart, but I'm not too stupid. I've been learning for two months now, but my driving skills are still indifferent, and the test has only become a dream. There are many students who have been studying for almost a year and still can't try.</p>
<p>The two-month summer vacation has passed slowly, and most schools have started again. Of course, I can't let the precious time be destroyed in empty expectations, I have to continue to work hard in my position. However, I hope that my comrades and friends will not repeat my mistakes. I am a good warning. And I dare to guarantee that, in addition to this school with only an external appearance, there is no school more corrupt than it.</p>

<p>Random Notes on Performers</p>
<h3>Miss Yu Sulian, a Famous Dan, Talks About Stage Life and Aspirations (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Leng Fang's Records</p>
<p>(Editor's Introduction) Yu Sulian, from Hangzhou, is twenty-two years old. She specializes in female roles (Hua Shan) and has a wide repertoire. She initially performed local plays, and her true talent was not revealed. Last winter, she joined "Golden Stage," and finally, she was able to fully demonstrate her strengths. As a result, her reputation rose sharply, and her position in the theater world changed dramatically from the past. Eager to improve, she is not complacent, and her future achievements are immeasurable. Today, among the southern female roles, she is indeed a rare and excellent person.</p>
<p>While learning and performing at the same time, my stage life has unknowingly reached seven years today! Singing is such a difficult job. In such a short process, there will certainly not be very high achievements in art. However, I have a very strong commitment to learning and have not neglected my courses and work for even a day. I firmly believe that success always belongs to those who work hard. Therefore, my only task is to constantly bury myself in hard work on the path of art.</p>
<p>Learning to Act as a Child</p>
<p>My father's stage name is Yu Xiaonong, and he used to play male roles (Xu Sheng). He was originally from the Xiliancheng Opera School in Beijing. When I was ten years old, he taught me to sing opera at home in Hangzhou. Because I didn't really like learning male roles, we soon moved to Ningbo, where I went back to school to study. Later, when I was thirteen, we moved to Shanghai, where I began to learn opera from teachers, focusing on Qingyi and Hua Shan roles. I have had more than twenty opera teachers, and I have learned quite a few different plays, probably around a hundred.</p>
<p>First Time on Stage</p>
<p>I remember my first time on stage was in Hangzhou, singing a week of charity performances. I was only fourteen years old at the time. For the first few days, I was a little nervous on the red carpet, but after singing for two or three days, my enthusiasm suddenly soared, and I no longer felt shy. After that, I worked hard to learn opera and also hired a female teacher to teach me to read. When I was sixteen, the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident occurred. Coincidentally, someone from Ningbo invited my father and me to join their troupe. We left Shanghai in a semi-refugee situation. I performed in Ningbo for a year, which was also the beginning of my formal debut. Regarding my acting experience, from the age of seventeen, I spent more than a year wandering around Nanjing and the Yangtze River area. The following year, I returned to Shanghai and was invited to perform at the same stage for nearly two years. Then, I moved to the Carlton Theater for eight months. In the early winter of last year, I was hired by the Golden Theater, and I have been there ever since.</p>

<h3>Preface to the An Kang Elegant Gathering (4)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Among the "Four Unions", although there are also places where Yifan transitions, its first section is purely southern style, never mixing in northern tunes. It is only when transitioning to allegro that it enters the northern melody and uses Yifan. People in the Ming and Qing dynasties liked to incorporate Southern Xianlü into Shuangjiao tunes, which shows that "Four Unions" actually originated in the Ming dynasty. Although Song people had lyrics like "Four Offenses" and "Eight Offenses" and favored self-composed tunes like Jiang Baishi, they still did not adopt Yifan. Only Su Dongpo's "Water Melody" has the style of a Guanxi strongman with a bronze zither and iron clapper. This is because Long and Shu are close to each other, making it so. The name "Four Unions" can be proved by "Eight Unions."</p>
<p>In our Hangzhou Lantern Festival, the dance of fish and dragons is performed, with a so-called score of "Yang Xiang Eight Unions." All eight sounds of gold, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood are fully equipped, similar to ten-beat gongs and drums, but without Zhaojun's pipa and Wenji's Hu jia. This is based on Shao Shi Yang striking the chime stone and Xiang. Two cymbals, three gongs, two drums, and one clapper are used with hand percussion and wooden fish to mark the rhythm. Additionally, trumpets are used instead of Xun Chi. The so-called "Four Unions" removes gold, stone, gourd, and earth, and uses silk, bamboo, leather, and wood. But drums and clappers are combined with silk and bamboo, and gongs and drums are not used. Although divided into four sections, there are eight segments, from adagio to allegro, symbolizing the division of time. Heaven has no words, so there is sound but no text. It cannot be compared with the loss of sound of Lu drums and Xue drums. It is like the unspoken understanding between high mountains and flowing water. As for its singing sentences, they are not seven-character quatrains, but Partridge Sky and Auspicious Partridge. Qin Guan and Yan Shu liked this tune, which proves that it is a Song dynasty lyric rather than a Tang dynasty poem. It is a pity that Wen Tianxiang's story has no tradition of singing. It was probably forbidden by the Yuan people, just like the Guangling San, which has been lost. It is a pity. I sincerely hope that the people in the An Kang Elegant Gathering can supplement its loss like Shu Xi, so that it will be beneficial to the world and people's hearts like the poems of South Nigh.

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The new theaters have superstitions about opening the door and breaking the stage, so general insiders always attribute the blame to the pharmacy opposite the stage. The gate of the Tianchan is facing northeast, and the pharmacy opposite is located in the corner facing southwest. The so-called tip-to-tip, corner-to-corner, point-to-point is not biased. I do not understand why the owner who built the house in the first place, since he wanted to build a theater, no matter what the seniors of the Pear Garden said, he could always change the gate to face north or east, avoiding this number, wouldn't it eliminate the distorted psychology of general superstitious people? In addition, such as the wind of the stage often rises, sometimes open and sometimes closed, is also in line with a Beijing slang: it is really a bit evil.</p>
<p>The opening of the door is certainly a careful matter, and at the same time, when the stage is completed, there must also be a grand ceremony of breaking things. The actors who sing martial arts plays and the people of the entire martial arts line are certainly particularly devout to pay attention to this matter, hoping for the blessing of the gods, so that they will not throw the knives and guns out of their hands and smash them on the eyes of the audience, or fall off the iron railings (now abolished on the stage) and several tables and break their waists and legs. Even the students, dans, and clowns who sing civil plays are also afraid that they will get their head tendons and break their arms and backs at the limit of bone setting during grabbing backs and hanging hair (the limit of bone setting, that is, the important). If there are really these unfortunate events on stage, then the general actors will blame it on the carelessness of the initial breaking of the stage, resulting in today's mistakes, if they do not recognize their own mediocrity. Regarding this matter, I have personally seen it in the Yunlong Stage in my hometown, and the actor who caused the trouble that day was the martial arts student Shan Deyuan, who is currently performing on a certain stage in this city. Those who are familiar with Shan Ling may wish to inquire. (Eight Nine)</p>
