<p>社評</p>
<h3>安定外匯黑市幾點希望</h3>
<p>上海黑市外滙市價，自縮入對英四辦士關口以後，常呈動盪不定的現象。在一年半黑市之每一階段，此種現象殊屬少見。正惟此種現象是少見的，所以我們可以相信，這決不是顯示維持方面的沒有力量，而是說明尙沒有到維持方面決定政策的時候。在香港電訊中，很可以看到跟平衡匯市有關的羅傑女氏，在視察上海金融市塲以後，正在跟有關方面進行談話，日方且傳說中英兩國有採用新通貨計劃的擬議。不論將來如何歸趨，然而我們相信，對目前動盪不安的黑市，當局必然將採取更有效更有利的方法，來增强法幣在抗戰中的抗禦力，則是可以無疑的。</p>
<p>黑市滙價的貶低，對整個法幣的外滙基礎並不削削弱，對日方却是一種壓力。日方不但在佔據區中攫得大量的關稅，在黑市中結購外滙；就是流落在上海的日圓市價，也是掩護在法幣的外滙黑市身上。外滙黑價的貶低，使日方獲得更少的外滙，使日圓顯呈更甚的跌價，這是對的。但因為黑市的一再貶低，却也使許多購買外滙與黃金的人獲得了許多不當利得，加甚了關於法幣的惡意謠言，也增多了資金的對外逃避。同時，黑市的貶低，固可以增進出口，但因了市價的動盪不定，却也有使貿易商有暫時趨向觀望的可能。所以從這幾點看來，今後外滙黑市，採取進一步的安定方策自有考慮的必要。</p>
<p>外匯黑市之所以進展到現階段，除日方的搜奪以外，我們對港滬兩地的投機商，實不能予以恕辭。中英外匯平衡基金一千萬鎊的設立，是在本年四月初，至今不過三月，而半年來全國貿易的入超不過，一萬萬元，合成英金不足三百萬鎊。假定平準會已經放出五百萬鎊來維持黑市，就可以知道其中幾乎一半是給無意義的投機家消耗了。因此，外滙黑市的緊縮，入超固然是一個原因，但眞正的原因，還是在投機家的搗亂。平衡基金本來是扶助正當貿易商的，而現在受惠的却是一批惡意的與投機的人，想來是很可以痛心的。</p>
<p>日方與投機者所以在黑市中有活動的可能，是因為外滙黑市原則上是放任的。過去平衡基金的目標，只在維持市價的均衡，而對於購買外滙的用途，却沒有經過審核的手續。所以在供給無謂消耗的一點上，固然近於浪費，而對於加强法幣抗禦力的一點上，也沒有完全顯示效能。　我們覺得維持外滙黑市的目標既在扶植正當的貿易，而同時維持法幣的用意是在增强法幣的信用；因此，在今後，希望新擬議能夠顧到下列各方面。</p>
<p>第一，黑市的存在，是法幣的漏巵，不論黑市滙價如何貶低，但是惡意者拿了法幣就可以向黑市扒得外滙，無論如何是抗戰中資源的損失，也是正當貿易商的損失，所以各友邦銀行應該帮同中國政府，不再支持黑市。</p>
<p>第二，法幣流通的地方，就是保障各國貿易的安全地帶。所以任何方面破壞法幣的工作，就是破壞各國貿易的工作。有關各國，允其是英美，為了維護其本身的利益計，應該帮同中國，使法幣的抗禦力格外加强起來；其利害與協助中國抗戰純是一致的。</p>
<p>第三，外匯必須實施審核制度，這是中國政府一年半來苦心孤詣的一點，也是各友邦應該共同了解的。這不但合乎經濟原理，也對各國正當貿易有利。中國政府願意維持各國的正當商業，却不願意因此而反予惡意者以利用機會。各國政府如果必須維持黑市，也必須跟中國政府採用同一審核的步驟，使正當貿易者能夠獲得必要的外匯。</p>
<p>最後，為了增强法幣的抗禦力計，要遏止投機與一切資金逃避，在一定匯率上安定下來，也是必要的。</p>
<p>法幣外匯最後的基礎，是站在中國的無限富源上，絕不會動搖毫末。同樣的戰時貨幣，法幣業已打敗日圓。將來獲得勝利之後，外匯黑市的惡氛，雖亦能自趨消滅，但當前安定黑市的良好方法，却可以使法幣的基礎比現在更充實起來。</p>
<h3>中國幣制問題　英法美商榷中　英報主張拒絕日方企圖　風傳新貨幣計劃說不確</h3>

<h3>英國會休會期間　張伯倫謀貫澈主見　英國本身勢遭犧牲　全國人心極形不安　反對派準備大奮鬬　倫敦航信</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>目前英國人心的不安與騷動，眞有「惶惶」不可終日之勢，的確，像這種人心惶惶的樣子，在這裏，已經不止是一天的了；但要指出來的是，自前天張伯倫首相在議院裏，以二百五十票對一百三十二票的多數，否決了反對派提出的，提早於八月二十一日召集議會的提議以後，這兩天來，英國全國的人心，特別地呈現了緊張與浮動。</p>
<p>近幾個多月來，各方面的勸服·遊說，甚至驚吿等等，誠然是用盡了方法，然而張伯倫的全意，已經完全打定，毫無通融更改的餘地，他還是要照着他的「路綫」，一意孤行到底。於是，為了遂行他的「路綫」，他不得不盡量地對外採取秘密外交，對內採取寡頭政治。因而除了今後一切機密外交消息，他打算澈底封銷外，遺對於那些議院裏的反對派議員們，打算採取躱避政策。所以從八月四日起到十月三日止的議會例定休假期間，在他，是早就期待著的了。不過事件來得往往超過他的意料之外，剛在休假來臨的前夜，他自以為外交傑作的所謂「東京方式一，並沒有像上次慕尼黑會議一樣，為他取得「和平使者」的頭銜，相反的，却激起了全英國人士的憤槪和惶感，跟著，在開明的保守黨人士邱吉爾·艾登·等人指導下的每日電訊報，就揭出了當時正在進行中的所謂「赫德生和平計劃」。這兩個事件的相繼來臨，立刻在英國造出了一種深刻的不安空氣。據記者個人的看法，這一回的不安程度，恐怕還超過去年慕尼黑會議的前夜。因為大家都淸淸楚楚地了解，去年慕尼黑會議的犧牲品，僅僅不過是捷克，而這一次，一個不留神，那犧牲品，却直接地就是英帝國自身！</p>
<p>和英國一般開明的，有遠見的人們打擊阻止「張伯倫內閣路綫」的同時，有中國的蔣總裁，發表了他的有力表示；跟著，美國大總統羅斯福，忽然毅然地宣佈廢止美日商約。這兩個來自中美兩友邦的措施，除外交的作用不計外，在英國內政上，也立刻受到了波動，替反對「張伯倫內閣路綫」的人士們，盡了一個聲援的作用。這樣一來，英國全國與論的力量，全都動員起來了。</p>
<p>一個短期間內，張伯倫對日屈服的計劃，是被阻止在僅僅「方式」的階段內了，而毫無進展的可能；尤其令他塲心的；是那個大刀闊斧的「赫德生和平計劃」，被大家一揭穿，立刻就宣佈了流產。</p>
<p>張伯倫一流人們，對於這一次的不能貫澈到底他們的計劃，是惱怒極了；除掉不願絲毫修改他們的原有計劃外，還進一步，打算改變方式，趁即要到來的議會兩個月的休假期內，來施展他們的路綫。這兩天來，英德間的秘密接觸，又頻繁起來了。詳細情形，外面一點也不知道；不過就所能知道的來說，最値得注意的是張伯倫親信人物之一的凱姆斯來勳爵（Lord　Kemsley）的秘密赴德。他此行意義，據他對人說，是在於會見德國宣傳部長戈培爾，為了與德國各報「交換文章」，藉以「了解彼此的觀點；」因為在地的統制之下，一共有四份在英國銷行很廣的報紙，那是：每日記事報·（Daily　Sketeh）星期泰晤士報·（Sunday　Times）星期繪事報·（Sumday　Graphie）及星期紀事與裁判報（Sundayh　Chrinicle　and　Referee）。他在德國停留了大約三五五的樣子，又已回到了英國。所謂「文章」云云，固未得見，但接著而起的傳聞，却是德國戈林將軍打算訪英，及某幾位英國要人的不久後的訪德。這一切。雖沒有完全具體化，但英現政府未來外交的方向，是非當淸楚地，可以表示出來的。</p>
<p>所以從「東京方式」宣佈「赫德生和平計劃」揭穿時起，一直到七月底止的大約十天之內，英國全國賢明人士們，以邱吉爾·艾登·為首，在不斷致力著一個運動，那是：無論如何，要縮短議會休會期間，以便全國人民，對現政府取絕對嚴密的監視。照當時的空氣判斷，再加上這一班有力人士的推動與領導，大家的佔計，滿以為他們一定可以達到目的，通過縮短議會休假期間的，然而，在這種千鈞一髮的時候，張伯倫首相却開始反攻了。</p>
<p>他的第一步，是在七月三十一日那夫，在議會裏，劈別就宣佈凖備適應法國的要求，派出三個軍事代表，立即赴莫斯科，開始參謀部間的談判。這一點，原是英法蘇同盟不能成立的最大癓結之一，張伯倫一流人物，對這，一貫地是拒絕討論；而現在，却忽然自動地宣佈派遺代表，那安定人心的作用之大，是可以想見的。誠然，沒有這樣一個重大的舉措，他萬難安定下當時因「東京方式」和「赫德生和平計劃」而十二分浮動起來的人心。於是連著，在八月一二兩天內，他不斷地又宣佈了些為英國全國人所要求，而沒有得到滿足的，一些政府方面的讓步，比如關於套老金案空防設備案等等。這一切，自然是為的安定人心，以便在議會裏擊退反對派們提出來的縮短議會休假期間的議案。</p>
<p>經過了嚴密的佈置和處心積慮的運動，在八月二日這一次的議會裏，張伯倫首相是竟然能以大多數的票數，擊退了反對派人士們的縮短休假期間的提案；二百五十票對一百三十二票。</p>
<p>那一天，為了這一個上下不過相差一個半月時間的休假期問題，張伯倫首相與反對派領袖人物們之間，眞是爭論得「臉紅　子粗」；那時，張伯倫首相的又惶急又惱怒的姿態的，是頗為可掬的。然而，在明眼的旁觀者看來，這却是一個具體的幽默；照例定，十月三日復會，而反對派們的擬定期間，却是八月二十一日。如果張伯倫首相並沒有什麼不可對人言的計劃，要打算在這一個期間內去施行，那末，為了區區的一個半月的相差間題，他又何必那樣固執？那樣不惜費力呢？</p>
<p>其實，英國比較消息靈通的人，早就知道得非常淸楚了，大概最可注意的期間，是在於德國九月初紐倫堡國社黨年會的左右。所以，他們的目標，是八月二十一日復會。這，却剛剛碰在張伯倫首相最疼痛的心病上！</p>
<p>現在，從今天起，英國的國會，開始休會了。張伯倫首相，據說也要回到鄕下去「釣魚」·不過，照現在的情形看起來，他這一回的下鄕以後，比起在倫敦唐寗街十號的辦公時來，也許還要忙些，也說不定。下鄕的主要目的，自然是在避開在倫敦時必不可免的注意。那末，他將忙的些什麼呢？具體的項目，現在我們還不敢預料，但推想起來，自然仍是推行他的「路綫」，而絕不是如這兩天來所口口聲聲說着的，什麼「加緊英法蘇同盟的談判」，或什麼「和美國政府保持密切合作」。</p>
<p>可是，這絕不是兒戲的事！現在英帝國的自身，是巳經處在非常危險的境地裏了！這些年來，全世界普遍的口號，是「集體安全」，是一切國家携起手來，打擊專以侵略為業的德日意三國；但，自從英國「張伯倫內閣路綫」推行以來，他已經先後出賣了奧國·捷克·西班牙·以及亞爾巴尼亞等國。直到今天為止，我們最理想的情勢歸宿，自然仍是「集體安全」。不過，情勢的發展，有時是不獨超出人們的願望，而且也超出人力的控制的。以目前情勢判斷，如果張伯偷首相仍然固執地推行固有「路綫」，如什麼「進攻蘇聯」，「瓜分中國·南美」，「瓜分東南歐各小國」，「拆散德日意」等等，那一類的做法，公然去做，那末，情勢之所趨，幾年來的所謂「集體安全」口號，當然有一天會永歸消滅，接着而起的，倒不是別的國家的災禍，這災禍，第一個就恐怕會落在英帝國自己身上的！</p>
<p>對這一種非常分明的情勢的趨向，英國一般比較有頭腦的人，都是了然的。從這裏，因而就產生了目前英國人心惶惶的狀態。因而，英國人民，也就把監視張伯倫現內閣當為他們目前的唯一重大任務。</p>
<p>雖然在國會休假案上，張伯倫這一次是如願以價了。但同時，在另一面，我們必須指陳出來，英國反對「張伯倫內閣路綫」的人們，也在更進一步地團結自身的力量，凖備和張伯倫一流人物，作最大的奮鬬。現在，除去所有比較重要的報紙及與論機關的人士們，巳經完全動員起來，特別工作緊張起來，凖備用最大努力，衝破張伯倫首相即將佈置的新聞封鎖綱，隨時向世界及英國民衆們指示事實眞相外，那些比較有力的國會議員們，也都彼此約定，不到離開倫敦太遠的處所去，以便保持最密切的接觸，一遇必要，就立即督促政府召集國會復會。</p>
<p>在外交方面，他們現在最堅持的幾個目標，不外：（一）制止政府出賣中國，（二）制止政府對波蘭·對土耳其·背信，（三）加强與美國合作，（四）促成英法蘇同盟。好在這幾個最低限度的目標，是目前英國全國人民最普遍一致的要求。尤其和美國合作及援助中國抗戰這兩點，則更是比較普遍地被全英國人所接受和贊助。萬一他們現政府的措施，有違背這兩點的處所時，那末，一經他們指摘出來，就立刻會激動一種反對的空氣，很足以制止張伯倫放手做下去的。此如東京方式」和美國廢止商約措施後那些天，在英國反應的情形，就是最好的例子。</p>
<p>雖係如此，但我們也絕對不能忽略英國反對一張伯倫內閣路綫」的開明進步人士們，在內政上所處地位的困難。他們雖然亳無疑問的，在反對張伯倫首相的看法和做法，但，在可能範團內，他們也在竭力避免着在外國人的眼裏，造成「分裂」的現象。他們恐怕那麼一來，不獨與等無補，相反的，反會提早英國禍患的來臨。此外，比較有身分，有參進未來內閣人士們的態度，則格外來得愼重。像邱吉爾·艾登·等人，就絕對不能學元老身分的路易喬治的放言無忌。在英國這傳統的政治空氣裏，想上政治舞臺的人，第一不可失去的，就是所調「紳士風」。</p>
<p>所以當前的困難，就是在於怎樣一面不失「紳士風」，一面又能阻止張伯倫首相一意孤行地做去；換句話說，就是在於不令張伯倫首相利用他們的「紳士風度」，去遂行他自己的寡頭政治和秘密外交。（八月四日寄）</p>

<h3>今晨潮汛將達　最高峰　有登陸可能　商戶已預防</h3>
<p>黃浦江高潮、昨晨零時四十六分續發、數量在十二英尺以上、雖因天氣之晴爽、潮水並未溢岸、惟低窪馬路、均有潮水自陰溝灌登、迄十時許、始行退盡、昨日午後一時三十一分、繼續高潮、惟數量較早潮略低、今日晨前一時三十分之高潮、據濬浦局預測有十三英尺一寸五分、而外灘駁岸之高度、則祇十三英尺、故江水殊有登陸可能、極堪注意也、</p>

<p>上海租界所有建築黃砂石、原產於嵊山及泗礁列島一帶由各帮運砂船、裝運來滬銷售、以供各營造商所需、惟邇來某方企圖統制該項砂石、特派遣汽艇多艘、在吳淞口外銅沙洋面一帶、往來游弋、攔阻所有砂船、迫令貶價出售與所謂「華中砂石公司」、致目前租界各地、砂石來源奇缺、滬市營迭業、咸起恐慌、</p>
<h3>日圖統制菜蔬　忽生變卦　菜販徬徨　無所適從</h3>
<p>日方於日前在浦東方面、張貼通告、希圖將浦東蔬菜、自咋日（十六日）起、一律截往虹口統制出售、頃據調查、此項新辦法、昨日忽發生變卦、原因不明一亦未於事先知照展期實行、以致昨日上午、有大批浦東菜販、徬徨浦東大道、有擬走其昌棧碼頭、有擬走東昌路碼頭、莫知適從、相持良久、無人指引、結果中偽「警局」仍許彼等由東昌路碼頭原道搭乘渡船運進租界、故昨日各市塲蔬菜、未見缺乏、</p>

<p>吳淞前（十五）晚九時、張華浜日駐軍及金谷憲兵司令部、突發警告云、中國飛機一小隊、計三架、飛抵淞境天空、飛翔頗高、而無響聲等語、遂突行燈火管制、同時通知鐵路工廠及蘊藻浜西華豐·永安·兩紗廠、各該工廠聞報、立即煞車停工、中國飛機飛翔於天空約兩小時、似係偵察性質、故未擲彈、嗣因任務完畢、安返根據地、至十一點三十分、日軍始告解警、各工廠亦即開車復工、然停已有兩個半鐘之久、一塲虛驚、始得完畢、故昨晨八時、到有小型兵艦一艘、停泊於亞生關輪之旁、至十時餘始開往上海、</p>
<h3>工部局拒絕猶太能民　實行尙有問題　局方與日方意見相左　住居地點「頗多糾葛」</h3>
<p>大陸報云、關於工部局昨日（十五日）所發終止德籍猶太難民來滬之命令、巳起許多糾葛、工部局總辦費利浦昨在日領署中與日總領事三浦晤談、嗣經記者叩詢、費氏不願披露談話性質、惟稱、「頗多糾葛」、費氏對於所傳業已首途來華之難民、將准登岸、及不准登岸兩說、不能言定、咋據消息靈通方面聲稱、此即現加</p>
<p>討論要點</p>
<p>聞工部局堅主蘇州河南岸無難民容身之餘地、但在「人道的」理由上、局方宣稱、應准移民登岸、惟須居蘇州河北岸、就他方面言、日方則頒令、謂留居公共租界「被佔區」中之歐洲猶太移民、均須於今日（十六日）登記、過期不發留居許可證、聞日當局為人道主義的」理由亦願准移民入公共租界、惟須留居</p>
<p>蘇州河南</p>
<p>岸、同時、移民昨日羣赴本市照相館攝影、俾於今日截止期內登記、蓋日本海軍陸戰隊上週所頒登記命令、規定須附照相也、據咋日估計、至今日截止期為止、向日當局登記之難民、當不下萬人、按彼等巳在此間德總領事館登記、又字林報云、記者咋向工部局某</p>
<p>高級人員</p>
<p>叩詢、昨日搭意郵輪自熱那亞啟椗來滬之猶太難民八百五十人，將吾准許登岸、據答、尙未決定、惟有拒絕彼等登岸之可能、同時、現居上海之猶太難民一萬五千人、旣悉星期五日日方發言人宣佈不復准難民入虹口、復聞工部局突然宣佈將來難民不得在此登岸、乃</p>
<p>大起騷動</p>
<p>蓋上海為舉世對猶太移民不加限制之唯一口岸、至星期一日午後始宣佈限制也、各收容所中許多難民均焦切以期彼等之親串、本年內離德抵滬、昨聞若輩將不准登岸、收容所中遂現悲慘景象、此項新辦法、將拆散難民家屬，而德境內盈千纍萬猶太人、已被剝奪</p>
<p>離德希望矣、然一般人以為工部局與日當局旣對難民苦境寄予同情、或將從寬實施新規定、聞對此間移民負責之委員會於工部局及公董局星期一日宣佈此等辦法後、雖未舉行會議、惟對此等辦法所起種種問題、刻正加以研究中、</p>

<h3>為行旅安全起見　限制滬輪駛鎭</h3>
<p>規定兩輪運駁為限　天寶專輪担任駁卸　謀福裝貨過量退關</p>
<p>滬甬航綫自經本巿德商禮和洋行謀福輪首先呈准寗波當局、改泊鎭海口外、宣告復航後、先後呈請核准加入行駛者、計有德平新北京寶利哈納頴州恩德等六艘、連謀福共為七艘、至新北京雖已呈請、但運貨泉州又赴厦門卸貨、定今日始可返、故滬甬綫尚未開航、該輪返滬後是否駛甬、現尚未定、惟以甬埠駁船缺乏、且悉以木質製造、載重不多運駁需時、兼以外輪駛鎭突增、遂愈感不敷分配、往往每輪停滯鎭海逹十餘日之久、猶未獲起卸客貨者、致一般旅客囦處船中、痛苦不堪、且在開行前、又因旅客擁擠、爭先恐後、尤足釀成危險故已决定租用該輪為運駁專輪、則客貨運駁均可較臻安全便利、不致有被海浪激盪危險、聞該輪已開始運駁、</p>
<p>當局限制　駛鎭次序</p>
<p>據大光社記者昨向航業界探悉、寗波防守司令部鑒於外輪駛鎭增多、駁船不敷分配、且運駁方面、因輪多人雜、易起爭攘而肇災禍、故為力策行旅安全起見、業經決定限制滬輪駛鎭次序、規定外輪駛泊口外運駁以兩艘為限、待兩輪裝卸完畢後、方准第二批輪隻再行駛入駁運、當即令飭鄞縣航業工會轉知滬各輪公司遵照、並請自行排定開船時間、以免抵鎭後不准卸駁、而遭受無謂損失、</p>
<p>租用天寶　運駁專輪</p>
<p>德商施毅德洋行之天寶輪、向行駛甬定航綫、自定海失陷、甬定交通被阻後、該輪即泊甬停航、迨滬鎭綫恢復、該輪為便利旅客往返、經開航甬鎭綫、茲以甬埠駁船缺乏、各輪當局以天寶輪船身較小、在鎭海封鎖綫缺口、仍可進出、</p>

<h3>國師近狀</h3>
<p>（重慶訊）敎育部鑒於中等學校缺乏優良師資、對於整個敎育亦發生不良影響、特創設國立師範學院為改進全國各級敎育基礎、茲將抗戰期間國立師範學院狀况分誌如次、</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>國師的籌備、是始於去年七月、其時由敎部聘請潘公展·朱經農·注德耀·吳俊升·廖世承五位先生為籌備委員、並指定廖世承為籌備主任、旣以潘公展就任湖南省政府委員、因又改聘袁哲遞補主任、廖世承對於國師的籌設、因負有專責、所以自奉命以後、即開始工作、親至湖南各地、選擇院址、建造院舍、並先後至上海、重慶、聘請敎授、出席全國高等師範敎育會議、商討師院今後一切實施大計、而汪德耀袁哲兩位先生、則協助辦理一切籌備事宜、對於國師之籌設、皆有極大的貢獻、至十月下旬、遂乃正式成立、</p>
<p>院址院舍</p>
<p>國師的院址、原經敎部決定設於湖南、初擬於湘西淑浦、嗣因交通不便、及匪風甚熾、改擇湘中安化藍田、為國師設立地址、藍田地鄰湘鄕、距淸季偉人會國藩的出生地、非常之近、地在湘黔道上、交通頗為方便、且為銻鑛出口之地、電燈電話、以及日常生活所需的物品、尙稱大致粗備、鎭北一里多路、在崗巒起伏之問、有一座大宅名叫「李園」、瓦屋百餘間、四而環植靑松綠竹、前有淸流曲溪、風景淸幽、絕無世俗紛華之氣、誠為讀書講學的大好處所、因由籌委會決定租為國師院舍、並於屋後隙地、添築講堂九間、於是敎室·宿舍·圖書館·試騐室、皆能具備、自去年十一月一日開學、五日上課、師生修藏游息其間、頗為適意、最近因為耍適應下學年的需要、正在計劃着建築新的院舍、以為新生及附設中學之用、敎職員與學生、國師籌設雖甚倉促、且受戰事及交通影響、聘請敎授頗為不便、但此次所聘各科敎授、則仍多碩學之士、現任敎職員、計有授課敎授講師十六人、助敎五人、及其他職員十餘人、除由籌委在德耀任敎務主任、及袁哲任公民訓育系主任外、並聘請敎界名宿任誠為主任導師、國學大師錢基博為國文系主任、敎育系主任、則由廖院長兼任、共餘敎授、亦皆聘自滬渝、多為歷任各大學敎職、講授多年、素負聲望之學者、學生係由敎部統一招考分發來院、錄取名額、原為一七九人、惟因戰事阻隔、未能完全到院、截至最近、到院學生計有男生九三人、女生一二人、合計一零五人、其中以省區分配、計湖南五四人、江蘇一三人、湖北九人、江西七人、廣東四人、安徽四人、廣西三人、浙江三人、河南三人、貴州二人、福建一人、四川一人、以湖南佔第一位、决為江蘇、亦尙佔全數百分之十二强、餘則均為少數、</p>
<p>圖書儀器</p>
<p>抗戰時期學校、對於圖書儀器的缺乏、幾為一致的感覺、但這新興的國師、却是例外的幸運、儀器方面、接收了安徽大學二百多箱、舉凡數理化生物以及醫務所用儀器藥品、幾乎可說是應有盡有、院內巳闢有化學生物試騐室各一、學生試騐、頗稱便利、至於圖書方面、初由部令將江蘇省立鎭江圖書館存湘書籍、移院應用、後以該項圖書為江蘇中學運至乾城、因交通及其他關係、一時無法接受，於是曾經一度感到圖書恐慌、但不久即將這個困難間題解決、即與湖南私立南軒圖書館商的、供用該館岡書一萬六七千册、合之院內由長沙金華湘潭等處所購、共有中西書籍二萬餘冊、其中重要中文書籍、計有古今圖書集成、四部叢刊初編續編三編、二十四史、四庫珍本、叢書集成、萬有文庫、宛委別藏等大部叢書、及湖南各縣方志、與古今名人集部多種、西文書籍中、以英文百科全書最為珍貴、至於坊間出版之中西書籍，亦能粗備、益以各地出版之雜誌刊物百十種、日報二十三種、圖書館的規模、已可適應院內師生需要、</p>

<p>烚赤猛抬二百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因鑒報載消息利多、且外滙形勢略疲、致塲中人心頗堅、開市即猛抬一百四十二元、錢兌業進某金號二十兩、價為四千四百九十元、繼之證券帮塞予錢兌業十兩、價四千四百八十元、時錢兌業納胃仍健、且散戶亦有吸胃、市勢上升、不久即抬高六十元、銀樓帮吐予現金號三十兩、價四千五百四十元、後回落五元、錢兌業賣予證券帮廿兩、價四千五百三十五元、此後證劵帮續來收買、兼某銀號亦稍有納胃、漲風又起、立升三十五元、證券帮進金號二十兩、價四千五百七十元、後買者觀望、立撳三十元、銀樓帮售予某金號十兩、價四千五百四十元、時聞外匯又軟、且錢兌業買意復萌、力吸數十兩、再抬四十元、某錢兌業進現金號十兩、四千五百八十元、其時港帮雖頻來吸收、但錢兌業忽反進為出、且某銀號亦來吐售、市象頓見反動向下、未幾即撳小五十元、錢兌業貿予某金號十兩、價四千五百三十元、後某銀樓進錢兌業二十兩、價又拾高至四千五百五十元、旋因外滙轉平、買者漸稀、證券帮與銀縷帮相繼塞出、為狀頓疲、不久回落四十五元、證券帮吐予銀縷帮十兩、價四千五百零五元、將近午刻某錢兌業忽代客力吸、情勢重堅、飛漲四十元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、為四千五百四十五元、咋午收價、午後潛勢轉平、開市做高五元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、價四千五百五十元、後某金號與證券帮頻來塞出、步落一十五元、金號互做三十兩、四千五百二十五元、入後錢兌業復來吸收、逐步向上、錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、四千五百五十元為晚收價、結果比上日猛漲二百零二元、全天一百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛轉金低六十五元、均鮮聞做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛高二十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百四十元、迨至九時四十分突掛高十五元、十時零五分又掛大五元、此後無變化、結果軋漲二十元、計大同行改懸四百六十元、新同行為四百五十八元、收進的减低二十元、</p>

<h3>外滙買風亦轉盛　九月份掉期拔開　套息在一角左右</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市況、匯豐掛牌揭曉、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、因上數日所傳中英平凖基金委員會將冉維待黑市外匯之說、仍無法證實、且日方電傳、香港中英已商妥新貨幣計劃、若此項計劃實行、對於某方與投機商頗受打擊、但對於法幣地位、則反而有利、故日方已在從中阻撓、再以歐洲局勢突轉樂觀、致一般操業者、又轉懷買意、如各大洋行界興華商等均前來吸收、兼西商沙遜亦稍購現貨先令、雖某美行賣意尙佳、無如頭寸仍感不敷分配、致潛勢步軟、十時二十分、英金曾緊至三便士四六八七五、美匯亦曾軟至六元七五、嗣後因扒風稍戢、且外行較肯塞出、致結果以英金三便士半、美匯六元八一二五收盤、本月期緊勢無異、但九月份因賣者甚少、故較現貨為緊、掉期更影拔開、聞某行曾貼予華商美金五六二五、合月息（除佣）九分三厘、若大數則某行肯貼出美金六二五、合月息一角〇三厘、半天交易尙旺、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均長一二五、紐約銀價亦大一二五、倫敦生金回落半便士、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬升〇六二五、美對英·對法俱平、對滬漲一角、中央掛脾各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士五六二五、美滙六元九三七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後華商吸力殊健、兼進口商及各洋行界等紛來扒結、但幸某美行對於英美匯尙肯塞出、致為狀僅略軟化、計洋行與華商結進某美行現貨英金三便士五三一二五、並現貨美滙六元九三七五及八七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、悉無上落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免徵、此後華商又扒進某行本月份美滙六元七五、繼而西商沙遜亦結進外行現貨英金三便士五三一二五、後華商再購結某行本月份美匯六元六八七五、兼又扒結匯豐等外行現貨英金三便士半、後最緊銀行會討過英金三便士四六八七五、美滙六元七五、將近午刻、外行賣意稍佳、致市勢漸平、時華商又結進外行九月份美匯六元、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三便士半、美滙六元八一二五、本月份三便士四三七五、美滙六元六八七五、九月份英金三便士〇九三七五、美匯六元、結果比上日現貨與本月英均緊〇六二五、美同軟一二五、九月英縮〇九三七五、美貴一八七五、午後週三無市、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊　上漲銳利</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外滙趨軟、烚赤上漲猛烈、英美金鎊、急趨堅俏、英美金票需耍甚盛、惟外滙變動未劇、且午後傳日軍在香港邊境進襲、空氣緊張、上升較微、香港法郎等票需要尙殷、市况頗堅、坎拿大票·菲律濱票·亦跟美金票而貴、澳金票供少而挺、日金票需耍殷切、晚市為一元一角六分、朝鮮票供給不暢、亦呈挺佾、晚市為九角五分、公會交易禾做開、昨日市價、英金鎊升四元五角、英金票升一元、美金鎊升四元、美金票升五分、香港票升五分、法郎票升五厘、坎拿大票升五角、菲律濱票升二角、澳金票升二元、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現回昂　拆息掛小</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、由跌回昂、每千元上午初做一百七十元光景、嗣更不支、即退至一百六十二元低價、近午漸見回上至一百六十七元半、下午步升突銳、昂至一百八十六元、終稍回下、結果為一百八十元、比上日回漲十二元半、錢業公會拆息、突見掛小二分、早午兩市均開一角八分云、</p>
<h3>美銀再度放長</h3>
<p>十五日倫敦電、銀市印度及投機家買進、供給有限、市面平、收盤後市面帶硬、照掛牌價高〇六二五有少數成交、大條銀近遠期均升二一五、紐的銀電、美現貨又長一二五、又孟買銀電、印銀市况堅挺、現貨與八月均續漲九安那、九月亦叉犬八安那、成交眾祇五十張、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價復抬　客秈源源到滬</h3>
<p>杜米　隔咋一度回跌後、昨以河下來源無到、車輪包子祗松江楓涇貨一千二三百包、更以跌價之後、引起本街店胃、致晨初開市、即見漲風、直至午收、巳恢復隔咋所跌、計漲一元半之譜、高錫粳開至二十九元、中市貨亦開二十八元半、常州鮮粳開二十九元、蘇同崑粳開二十八元半至二十八元二角、南港及松江早晚稻、河下開二十七元、包子開二十八元半、高蕪尖開二十五元、中决貨開二十四元左右、變元二十七元、香港糯二十八元、沛東新粳由滬廠出售五十擔、價二十七元、亦較隔昨漲上一元有奇、統計全市、成交不下七千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈　產地雖未正式續發搬出證、然少數存米、巳由華日行販設法由車輪兩路運到、今後尙有源源抵滬可能、因此咋日在粳米往漲店胃貪辦之下、客秈一度亦漲七八角、但旋又回落、結果祗較大五六角、成交數則三千包以上、</p>
<p>洋米　新定萬噸之說、尙未見諸事實、故行囤心思向上，上週開卅一元、前喊卅二元之新西貢、咋則以卅三元開出三百餘包云、</p>
<h3>麺粉堅穩　麥價微鬆</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉廠盤續開六元現鈔、本街交易仍活、良以近日各米店附帶零售麵粉者、已屬不少、故需要較往日為殷、惟囤戶方面、在市收買者、已覺减縮、蓋自前日米價一度回跌後、人心已較軟化也、統市成交本客併計二萬包强、市上回籠貨售價略鬆、但比廠盤仍須見加一角、咋亦開過數千包、價為六元一角云、今日出口有粉五千包運天津、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨來源頗旺、到貨的有七八千包、因目下火車噸位均小、故尙無大量抵埠也、連日市價一再猛騰、最高價已達八元九角外、其漲勢亦可謂透足矣、昨日廠胃及囤戶均有收辦、惟吃盤已較前為苛、統市計由福阜兩廠辦去丹陽·常州·浦鎮·浦東等麥五千包、囤·進蘇州南京丹陽等麥一千餘包、價較前疲數分至角許、</p>
<h3>證劵　北帮賣出　內債不易抬頭</h3>
<p>證劵盤、昨市人心仍見疲軟、市上又有不經之謠但交易則愈見消談、稍高即有放空、故價仍不易抬頭、北帮賣出頗踴、市上除少數補空外、新買戶寥若晨星、因金子又漲、人氣缺少興奮、集會時間無形减少、市價雖仍盤旋、市勢不易看好、咋日交易北帮十西號賣出為多、恒康號買進為多、故價先高後低、甲種又打破五十元關、後以順亨稍有吸進、但潤利及泰源仍有供給、結果仍小三角半至六角、成交總數不過三十萬元之譜、午後暗市又略疲一二角、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商證劵交易所設十股、價為二十六元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所報告云、咋日市况續趨平穩、各股價上落極微、據頃間收到美國上月份橡皮數字所示七月份消費計為四萬三千九百噸、六月份則為叫萬七千三百噸、而存底七月份係十七萬四千二百噸、六月份則為十八萬一千八百噸、</p>
<h3>紗花　公會照常營業　棉紗又升</h3>
<p>本日紗業公會照常開市營業、紗市趨勢轉昂、藍以在此二日中華南帮口對於二十支雙馬紗吃胃旣健且宏、故市價復趨上升、二十支雙馬新高學曾達七百五十九元、旋以獲利奢吐出、又復回挫十元、二十支特金城亦見七百七十五元、目前紗市有一部份鑒於原棉脚地暫無鬆落之望、心思看好、但消費方面、僅恃香港帮發展也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人心堅挺、因需要良好所致、開價廠單貨即漲十元外、少頃廣帮又有採辦、市態續緊一步、中途聞客帮納量已絕、現貨稍停不買、立刻下降十元光景、查半日成交七百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十元、牧羊漲十元、其餘均漲五元、廠家未有舉動、今日出口有紗一千一百件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>內地　一四〇　同行　四〇〇</p>
<p>香港　一六〇　北帮　二五</p>
<p>統計　七二五</p>
<p>午後消息、二十支雙馬廠單貨價又見昂漲、做到六百九十元外、比　盤價好幾元、</p>
<h3>外棉交易不弱</h3>
<p>中外棉花交易尚稱不弱、但本棉成交誠屬寥寥外棉多數係同業中賣買、廠方進胃亦微、申新廠進巴西花五十包、價為一百八十四元五角、永安廠進匯司登二百包、價為一百五十元、均係（鈔票送廠）、本棉僅一筆成交蘇北來源又見减少、到細絨花一百十二包、惟日商未有動靜、故市價大致與上日相彷、身骨較優之貨、微見昂漲、茲將現棉售盤情形錄左、</p>
<p>巴西花　一八四·五〇　申新廠進　鈔票送廠</p>
<p>白洛去　一四八·〇〇　同業中進　又　棧交</p>
<p>匯司登　一三五·〇〇　又　又　又</p>

<p>匯司登　一五〇·〇〇　永安廠進　又　送廠</p>
<p>彭家浦　一六〇·五〇　同業中進　又　棧交</p>
<p>美種打包　一一三·五〇　又　又　又</p>
<p>Prf藍貢　一四二·〇〇　又　又　又</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨日又因匯兌略緊之故、現棉售價轉挺、惟滬上存底微薄、故同業間爭相抬高、然華廠方面存底雄厚、祇有日廠方面因原棉缺乏、購意較為濃厚耳、日來因賣方售價之未能放鬆、購意亦趨鬆懈矣、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來殊為靜寂、開盤之初、因利物浦及孟買來電報指、及一部份空額之抵補、略有一部份海外棉商之購買而漲、華爾街方面亦較堅定、後因多額了結、及一週間美國廠方進棉報告减少、市况較疲、結果棉市平平、漲跌互見一二磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及漲二磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細布廠盤　仍見昂貴　東疋續鬆</h3>
<p>細布廠盤前日會索價二十二元、昨見再漲、手貨晨開二十一元五角、較前日亦漲二角半、午前又張二角半、重磅粗斜每疋二角半、餘檔粗細布、細斜印花貨價多平穩、絨布及漂染整理貨售盤混亂、廉價貨交易尙活、咋川滇帮辦色布·色斜二千餘疋、細布·細斜五大十包、粵港帮辦細布·細斜·粗斜·色斜·嗶嘰一百餘件、南洋帮需胃續盛、本街成交粗布·細斜·漂染整理印花各布二百餘件、</p>

<h3>南北貨　金山枝試新</h3>
<p>金山元枝、本屆新貨因成本寄昂、號方無敢嘗試、查前日僅到二十箱、以作探市性質、盈虧當所不計、昨曾開盤、尙未成交、陳貨亦到二十餘箱、當即開出、比前日又升近十元、又糯米枝開至二百六十五元、成交二十二箱、趨勢緊秀、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵續高</h3>
<p>會司鐵交易、素以本街印鐵廠·製罐廠·玩具廠·香烟廠·餅乾公司·及猶油聽作等為最大、其他客帮、則以天津為最活、靑島·烟台·溫州·福建·諸帮决之、長江帮以及華南諸帮則更决、惟自最近以來、長江及華南生意異常零落、其惟一之依賴者、當屬本街廠家及天津客商、查現時市上存底不充、人心甚佳、行情較前又好起四五元、刻市二百磅老鋼廠貨每箱售一百二十元、新鋼廠貨每箱售一百十七元、野鷄貨一百十四元、扎頭貨好者須一百十四元、决則開一百十元左右、查海外定貨、大的近一二天內可抵申、一</p>
<h3>煤炭　操縱煤價　慾壑難塡　再加八元</h3>
<p>近日外滙先令雖見回鬆、但煤業市塲各項貨色、仍見突飛猛進、尤以舶來白煤為最、日前鴻基煤同業拆價巳喊九十六元、較十日續加八元、其他如海峯馬克一致帶上、怒風猛浪、層出不窮、實係奸商圖利、推波逐流、有意抬高、結果有行無市、迄無成交、甚望煤業當局平定價格、以資劃一、减輕用戶負担、</p>
<h3>進出口　豆子二萬餘件　——由津運滬——</h3>
<p>十四日自天津豆子來八千三百五十包、北沙來豆子二千一百五十包、薄荷油二百七十件、秦皇島來水泥八千包、十五日天津來豆子一萬四千六百八十包、北沙來豆子九百六十五包、薄荷油九件、羊六十頭、十五日豆子運孟買二百四十噸、十六日疋頭運烟台一百件、運天津二十五件、</p>
<h3>海味　胡椒市況不一　茴香依然無到</h3>
<p>黑胡椒以底存稀少、去路仍活、市價乃繼續增高、前日售開數十包、黑大椒成盤為八十三元、一號椒八十五元、比前升起八九元、白椒較平、售一百三十元、</p>
<p>八角茴香、北海貨久巳乏到、惟銷路零星、此間尙有底積、足以應付、但來源維艱、苟轉手香港、頗難合劃、故近市漸緊、刻高呌一百零五元、較前須漲二十元矣、</p>
<p>藥材</p>
<h3>山奈業已售開</h3>
<p>山柰以來源斷絕、號貨扳緊未售、故乏成交、最近開過一莊、其價為三十三元、刻已呌三十五元、勢頗堅定、</p>
<h3>呢絨　英製呢絨　市況一斑</h3>
<p>市上昔所銷售之呢絨、均為英國貨、近年來方有非西貨到滬、傾銷競爭、「八一三」後、本街客帮買賣、門莊帮零剪及西服帮定製衣着主顧、多指選國產呢絨、如國產無出品、則悉指辦英國貨、行號方面為證明起見、將到貨樣及呢絨兩頭與包裝、一律改變、印寫「英國製造」字樣、同時為市面環境關係、到埠减少、先令一再猛跌、成本昂之不昂英製呢絨、在近來市塲上、可稱鶴立鷄羣、至形昂俏、茲將英貨最近市况一斑、查誌於下、</p>
<p>高等全毛呢絨　不論春夏秋冬四季衣料、均以英製者為上乘、西裝花呢類、更具特長、故一般拆貨店非此不能開設也、按英製呢絨、價雖昂貴、但質地身骨、確屬堅固耐穿、縮水褪色走樣發脆等弊、不特非西貨不能望其項背、即德法美意波蘇諸國出品、亦所不及也，英製各色呢絨、得能永久盛銷、良有以也、</p>
<p>呢邊有西文字呢絨　近仍風行一時、定價增加二辦士、現價漲五六角、尙比無字者為佾、今昔始終盛銷之老牌貨、有TTT維也納絨、A一一匕七法西襯、一五三三零元直貢、四零二六雨衣布、一零零五馬褲呢、白直貢近來以好華最為馳名、白嗶嘰以豐裕為普遍、黃斜紋以天祥為旺銷、珠羅紗以瑞康大兩花最著名、海林棒以林南牌子最老、華服袍料花呢普通市銷最賣者、則為九二五三身骨云、</p>

<h3>「我歌唱」</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>現代文學及藝術的應由內容來決定，恐怕已很少有人會表示異議。偶然在一本雜誌上看到一幅英國現代女流彫刻家巴巴拉，海普瓦斯的作品「母與子」，就可以作為證明。但筆者在未看圖旁的說明以前，只看見一大一小的兩塊磨琢鏤雕過的石頭，大的一塊上面有一個洞窟，擱在洞窟旁邊的小的一塊，則宛像一個石枕。若說這樣的雕刻為象徵「母與子」，筆者實自愧藝術素養的淺薄。據說道是「量，綫與動所構成的微妙的美，非外行所能瞭解。」</p>
<p>像這種只有少數「內行」能瞭解的桀作，並不是大衆所需耍的藝術。不錯，文化較低的一般大衆，固然不一定能够直接瞭解較高級的藝術品，但就連具有較高程度瞭解能力的「小衆」也不能看得懂的東西，至少是沒有甚麼現實價値的。</p>
<p>最近偶在友人處見到一本新出的詩集「我歌唱」。雖然不過是一本六十頁左右的小冊，却是十位新詩人的結晶。中間包含十篇創作，三篇譯詩，二篇理論。在整個文化事業快成眞空的「孤島」，就是這樣一本小書，也倍覺可愛，於是借回來讀了一通。</p>
<p>這本詩集的所以不稱詩而題名「我歌唱」，頗能表示詩的現實的意義。眞的，一般人提起文藝領域中的詩，就如同提起學術領域中的哲學一樣，好像是一種僅是少數人的高深莫測的玩意兒。其實哲學不過是組織化了的思維術，詩的來源也是人間藝術最原始的歌唱。歌唱是屬於大衆的，從而詩也本是應該屬於大衆的東西。只是由於物權階級的存在，詩也像別的文藝東西一樣，有一個時期被關進了象牙塔內，成了少數人的呻吟而不再是大衆的朗誦或歌唱了。這種惡影響，就是在抗戰中的中國，也不無發現，某一輩人的要求非關抗戰的文藝，就是一例。</p>
<p>要求非關抗戰的文藝東西，固然要不得，但在文藝上把抗戰的意義解得太狹，太機械，也同樣是不對的。在今日，國家的戰爭與國民個人間的生活，本應打成不可分離的一片。雖然實生活的形相是多方面的，但總不能離開一個總的歸依。不過唯其因為如此，將實生活作抒情表現的詩，也應該在總的目標下歌唱生活的各種形相和其意義。正如關露先生在其「詩歌精神總動員」一文中所說：「我們不一定要歌唱士兵刀刃和屍骨，此方像海湼歌唱萊茵河，高爾基歌唱海燕，普希金歌唱皇村：萊茵河，海燕，皇村也是歌唱自由解放與鬥爭的。我們可以歌唱充實我們生活中的任何東西。我們底生活是現實的生活，我們的歌唱也是現實的…」</p>
<p>詩人今日的任務固然不一定要歌唱直接與刀槍戰塲有關的東西，但他一定得歌唱「現實的生活」（不是現象的生活）——推動自由解放鬥爭的現實生活，換句話說，他必得高唱正義的歌聲！</p>
<p>限於篇幅，且不是書評，不能將本集的詩作較詳的分析。但「我歌唱」與「母與子」的雕刻完全不同。這雖不能說是大衆的詩集，至少一定知識程度的小衆可以讀得懂。每篇詩不獨各有一個內容，且在技巧上也頗具質樸美。但也許因為詩在技巧上偏重美學的關係吧，用太多的詞藻來强調內容的地方，是不無可以指謫的。但這樣的詩不過一二篇。</p>
<p>希望詩人們不以「我歌唱」為滿足，請以更充實的內容，把「我歌唱」擴大為每一個人的歌唱！</p>
<h3>流浪羣</h3>
<p>— 徐靑</p>
<p>路，沿着山麓伸展着，有時直坦到地平綫下；有時突然被山嘴擋住，來一個大兜灣。</p>
<p>路上的行列全攤開了胸，讓七月的夜風吹散一身的炎煩。喃吶的談天已在愉悅中靜下來，代替着的是噓噓的口笛，與扁担在肩上的嘰格嘰格響，這聲音，就給人們來一個辛苦的兌換。</p>
<p>睡在路一邊的江水，趁看夜籟發出它的夢囈。缺月鈎住了憂鬱的藍空，這情境又使幾個人起了懷鄉病。</p>
<p>「你看！我一家子，就剩這一担孩子啦！」說這話的是個四十朝外的中年人。</p>
<p>「總比全家都了結的强！」年靑的旅伴給他個倔强的安慰。</p>
<p>行列中有傷兵，老百姓，學生與敎授。為了野蠻的人在三十里外製造毀滅的故事，這些人毫不猶豫地離開了他們美麗的都市，拋棄了祖先遺留下來的居住地。</p>
<p>在後面的學生唱起歌來，是一支奮敎的老調：</p>
<p>「……不願做奴隸的人們！」這老調就越唱越精采，千百遍也不厭，一面又與一個脚上生濕氣的兵拉開嘴談笑。</p>
<p>矮子敎務長打起湖南官話：「大學生啦！黑夜行軍的規則都不懂，受過軍訓沒有？」</p>
<p>談笑的聲浪又一度的靜下去，影饗到前列的老百姓也啞息了嘴。</p>
<p>夜空裏添上無數星星，天河在不留意中轉變了指向，傲慢地與銀色的江水爭相交輝，夜，就在靜默的行程裏悄孽地奔溜着。萬籟俱寂裏，一個孩子尖起了喉嚨：</p>
<p>「爸！離外祖家還有多少路？」</p>
<p>「……怨聲加着哄騙，老年的爸底鬍鬚上沾上幾點唾沬。</p>
<p>路是畏的，夜是長的，然而流浪的人們忘却了這些，只知道在辛苦後會有卸下担子的甜息；趕長路後就會出現美麗的鄉村；黑夜過後有一個光明的睛天。</p>
<p>「遠的旅程總有歸宿的一天吧！」人們想着，抬頭望望天邊，月亮巳跌落山峯，牛女星收去了天河，東方正吐出一條靑，滲透了夜的輕紗。</p>
<p>「天快要亮了！」說這話的人底臉上畫出了熱情興希望。</p>
<h3>希望？事實？夢想？</h3>

<h3>伙夫班長（上）</h3>
<p>— 矞華</p>
<p>俞濟時將軍部下五一師三〇團一營二連的伙夫班長卜光德，他幹這項工作足足有二十年了，十四歲時候到軍隊里當小伙夫，到今天還是伙夫，參加過千萬回戰鬥，原想不幹了，可是他一年來宣了誓：『不打敗日軍，決不退伍幹別的，除非打死。』</p>
<p>卜班長，今年四十歲了，可是看樣子還像三十一二歲，身體很結實，能挑六七十斤重的担子，爬山，一天步行一百里路，臉上老掛着笑，性子是挺老實的。小時候，唸過四年書，十二歲起，在一家餐館裏當學徒，會燒些家常的菜，許是購辦伙食的機會太多了，他心算特別靈快而精確。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，五一師參加了瀏河，隴海綫，開封，南潯錢一帶很多决戰役，卜班長眞是無戰不參加，而且在前綫活躍得很，經過許多决危險，他至今還很康健。</p>
<p>那是去年六月間的事情，五一師在九江作戰，卜班長的一連配置在最前錢，他的廚房離火錢四里多路，那一天，打得很好，連隊特地預備了十斤牛肉，預備痛快地吃一頓，慰勞自己，卜班長率同伙夫出勁地煮這十塊錢的牛肉，九點多鐘，牛肉快熱了的時候，睛朗的天空裹，突然嗡嗡地出現了十八架大轟炸機，向火綫後面飛來，班長趕忙停火，把同志們都散開，立刻炸彈已大批在空中呼呼地往下掉，很多就炸中在廚房，一枚打碎牛肉又打碎飯鍋，十二個伙夫同志，六個被炸死，叫個炸傷，就剩班長跟另外一個小伙計。這是卜班長最氣憤的一天，其實同樣的遭遇也無數次了。</p>
<p>做伙夫的把飯煮好，他還得挑着送上前綫去，那是不管怎樣大風雨，或是綿密的彈雨底下，都得冒險送上去。依照中國軍隊的法律，伙夫非不得已不送飯給前綫作戰弟兄，他就得受槍斃的處罰。</p>
<p>班長在開封前方，跟兩個伙夫挑着千百担上火綫，一個伙夫中彈倒地死了，班長就一人挑了兩担，慢慢地送了去，這情形給他們團長知道了，特別獎了班長十塊錢，班長說過他倒不是怕犯法，祇覺得在火錢上作戰的同志是挺辛苦的，要是再挨餓，他煮飯的就過意不去。</p>
<p>所以全連的人，都跟班長親近，呌他『卜老板。』</p>
<h3>「觀人」和「知人」</h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>有人問我：「你以為在世界上做大事的人，要能獲得成功，他的第一個秘訣應該是什麼？」我說：「在善於用人而已！」他說：「這樣簡單麼？」我說：「看起來是簡單，做起來是萬分困難的。觀人的方法很多，知人的道理太大，孟子上說：「觀其眸子」，這是着重在眼晴上的；左傳上說：「舉趾高，心不固矣」，這是着重在脚跟上的。從眼睛看到脚跟，是觀的方法，不過「觀猶不難，難在一知」字。經書上說：「知人則哲」，可見能知人的就算得是個哲人了。</p>
<p>「知人」是第一套大學問；有了這一套大學問，纔可以談得上「用人」。人面易識，人心難知，所謂「知人知面不知心」，必能知心，然後可以說得上知人。有的人貌為溫良而實屬奸詐，有的人貌為恭順而實屬欺偽；有的人外勇而內怯，有的人外表盡力而內心實屬不忠。假使你不能表裏全知，沒有不上他的當的。那麼用什麼方法去測騐呢？據心書上說：</p>
<p>……知人之道有七焉。一曰問之以是非而觀其志，二曰窮之以詞辯而觀其變，三日諮之以計謀而觀其識，四曰告之以禍難而觀其勇，五日醉之以酒而觀其性，六日臨之以利而觀其廉，七曰期之以事而觀其信。</p>
<p>這些話實是觀人和知人的秘訣。和孔子所說：「始吾於人也，聽其言而信共行；今吾於人也，聞其言而觀其行，」有相得益彰之妙。覜志，觀變，觀識，觀勇，觀性，觀廉，觀信，觀人的道理，盡在於此，知人的道理，也盡在於此了。</p>
<p>近讀曾國藩覆方子白函有云：「……大抵觀人之道，以樸實廉介為質，有其質而更傳以他長，斯為可貴。無其質則長處亦不足恃。甘受和，白受采，古人所謂無本不立，義或在此。……」</p>
<p>心書上所說的七種觀察法，雖然詳盡，倒不及曾國藩所說的一種觀察法——觀質。觀質是根本的辦法，不過說來容易做來難，曾國藩一生事業的成功，就在能「觀人之質」吧。</p>

<h3>程硯秋本姓「成」</h3>
<p>— 一粟</p>
<p>偶在北平世界日報副刊上瞥見「程硯秋姓成」一文，頗感興趣，因特記之。程為四大名旦之一，獨創一派，名聞海內。最近侯玉蘭出演於黃金，博得盛讚，現已載譽榮歸。因其宗程腔，故有「女硯秋」之稱。從侯玉蘭之紅，可以想見程硯秋矣。惟關於「程硯秋」三字之由來，其中還有一段秘密。</p>
<p>關於他的姓名，固然硯秋是由艷秋諧音改成，就是他的尊姓，也是如此。他祖籍本是在旗，平時所認為旗人的姓，都是跟着譜名，一代和一代不同，他的父親，呌李成林，他用他父親的第二字作姓，應該呌成艷秋；但因為最初登臺，寫戲報的，以為姓成的太少，就自作主張，將他改為程艷秋，他們也沒有去改正，將錯就錯，就算姓程，現在巳經二十年（到現在，應為二十多年）了，大家却很少有人知道這段經過。他的兒子，本應姓永；但現在決定放棄原來習慣，自此以後，子子孫孫，永遠姓程了。</p>

<h3>Southern Henan Chinese Army Recaptures Changtai Pass; Japanese Forces at Yiyicheng Suffer Over a Thousand Killed; Qinyuan Also Retaken; Japanese Landing at Nantou Captures Shenzhen; British Bolster Border Defenses</h3>
<p>(Xi’an) Japanese troops occupying Xinyang and holding the Changtai Pass area were subjected to continuous assaults by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties. On the night of the 12th, the Japanese garrison at Changtai Pass, unable to hold their position, made a disorderly retreat to Xinyang. The Chinese army promptly retook Changtai Pass. Currently, the Japanese in Xinyang are in a state of panic, and some are showing signs of withdrawal. (Telegram dated the 16th)</p>
<p>Luoyang – In southern Shanxi, battlefield conditions have fluctuated. The Japanese intended to use six divisions to break the strategic north–south axis from Baiyin via Shanxi Highway to Meng County and the east–west axis from Linfen to She County. After suffering severe blows from Chinese forces on all fronts, the plan failed. Nearly at a standstill, the Chinese, leveraging superior strength, recaptured strongpoints along the Hongtun Road—Shangtun, Liangmazhen, and Fuchengzhen—and advanced toward Guxianzhen. The Japanese grew increasingly alarmed. Centering on Qinyuan, they launched six prongs from Huo County, Anze, Wanghe Town, Hechuan Old Town, and Donghong to “sweep” the Chinese north of Hongtun Road. Chinese forces split to intercept. Following a week of fierce fighting, the Japanese failed to achieve their objectives. As fresh Chinese units arrived, they adopted mobile tactics, striking northwest of Qinyuan. With morale soaring, they overwhelmed the Japanese despite stubborn resistance. After two days and nights of intense combat, on the afternoon of the 11th, the Japanese were routed and Qinyuan City was secured. Remnants fled via Songjiao and Xindian back to Qin County. Qinyuan, the enemy’s hub for six‑pronged operations, once in Chinese hands, turned their former ambitions to ashes. Military experts judge that the Japanese are now rushing to repair the North Shanxi–Shanxi Highway north of Changzhi and a light railway. Once transport is restored, they will again attack mountain passes southeast of Changzhi and the Lingchuan area. This is evidenced by 4,000–5,000 Japanese westward from Dongyang Pass, who seized Hancheng on the 8th in a bid to choke key eastern Shanxi points. However, since Chinese control of Hongtun, Yifu, and Fen routes, the situation has vastly changed. Across eastern and southern Shanxi, Chinese corps operate actively. Regardless of Japanese capability, any overreach will meet combined Chinese counterattacks and end in annihilation in mountain ridges and valleys. (Telegram dated the 16th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to today’s dispatch, Chinese forces in southeast Shanxi have continued remarkable victories. After five days of fierce assaults, Japanese troops at Yicheng suffered over a thousand fatalities. Jincheng is now heavily encircled. Japanese units advancing west from Qin County were intercepted by strong Chinese detachments. In Guangdong’s Dongjiang region, the Japanese again attempted to act, but their landing force at Dapeng Bay, despite naval bombardment from four warships, was repelled by Chinese forces. Concurrently, Japanese who landed at Nantou aimed to advance south along the Guangzhou–Kowloon Road, so Chinese reinforcements were dispatched to Shilong and Shitan to block them. Reports indicate about 3,000 Japanese troops moving south along the road. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports here today, Japanese troops landed at Nanshan at 1:00 a.m. and by 2:30 a.m. also at Bao’an in Nantou. About 1,000 troops, divided into four detachments, advanced along the twenty‑mile British boundary at Kowloon toward Shenzhen. By 11:00 a.m., they reached Shenzhen, having previously bombarded it from the air. Upon learning of the landing, British forces dispatched two battalions along the Japanese axis to bolster defenses. The Japanese claim the operation aims to eliminate Chinese guerrillas in the area and will conclude today. Some suggest the move is to seal off the entire Kowloon border, but British authorities dismiss this as rumor. It is reported that, 48 hours before occupying Shenzhen, the Japanese informed British authorities. After arrival, they conducted house‑to‑house searches. According to 5,000 Chinese refugees who fled into the British area, Japanese conduct was extremely brutal. Any household found harboring arms had occupants shot. As the troops neared Shenzhen’s outskirts, they swept the streets with machine‑gun fire. St. John Ambulance teams have been deployed to the border for refugee relief. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) About 1,000 Japanese landed overnight at Nantou in the Pearl River Delta, advancing towards Shenzhen on the Sino‑British border at Kowloon. These forces are now deployed along the border. Authorities have mobilized the Middlesex Regiment and a company of the Rajputana Rifles to the frontier. Four Japanese warplanes bombed Shenzhen before the attack this morning, apparently to suppress any resistance. Observers believe these actions may presage a blockade of Hong Kong similar to that imposed on the British concession in Tianjin, following unsatisfactory outcomes in Tokyo. (Reuters, 16th) Five hundred Japanese occupied Shenzhen this afternoon. British and Japanese forces now face each other across the boundary bridge, with Japanese troops less than twenty yards from the bridge. Before the occupation, a Japanese plane flew low over Shenxun Town, strafing the streets to deter guerrilla resistance, but encountered no opposition. The border is now calm. Troops on both sides stand guard across the bridge. There is no panic in Hong Kong, as the full implications of the Japanese move remain unclear. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to Japanese official sources, at 1:00 a.m. this morning, Japanese forces landed at Bao’an and advanced toward the Guangzhou–Kowloon Railway, intending to sever the line within the British boundary to facilitate clearing guerrillas alongside. The Japanese had informed Hong Kong authorities in advance. (Reuters, 16th) Tonight the frontier is quiet. The Japanese have fully occupied Shenzhen and nearby villages. It is reported that some farmers found with weapons were shot on the spot. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning’s landing at Nantou and assault on Shenzhen included aerial bombardment. By 10:00 a.m., reports indicated the capture of Shenzhen. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese dispatches received here, Chinese military authorities, with Hong Kong’s cooperation, have established a munitions supply route from Hong Kong via Bao’an into the interior of Guangdong Province. Since late July, the route from Bao’an inland has been defended by the 153rd and 159th Divisions of the Guangdong Army. Before today’s advance, on August 14, the South China Japanese command notified British authorities in Hong Kong that Japan would begin military operations at Dongguan and Bao’an, adjacent to the Kowloon lease boundary, requesting noninterference and that Chinese troops not use the leased territory—failure to comply would be Britain’s responsibility. Further reports state that this afternoon the Japanese occupied Shenzhen and commenced new operations to clear Chinese regular and guerrilla forces along the border of the leased territory. Early this morning at 1:00 a.m., Japanese troops made a landing at Nanshan in the Bay of Guangzhou near the leased boundary, occupied Bao’an by 2:30 a.m., then advanced east along the border toward Sha Tau Kok, expected to reach there today. During Guangzhou’s fall, the leased boundary region was once occupied by Japanese forces but was withdrawn to avoid international disputes. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) About 1,000 Japanese landed at Nantou in the Bao’an County jurisdiction on the night of the 15th, encountering fierce resistance from Chinese militia. Another Japanese detachment, supported by air cover, reached Shenzhen by 10:00 a.m. on the 16th. Gunfire and artillery could be heard in the New Territories. Two British battalions have been sent to the border on alert. Observers note that Bao’an County holds no major military value; the timing appears linked to stalled Anglo‑Japanese talks in Tokyo, aiming to blockade Hong Kong and cut off livestock and vegetable supplies from the mainland as a threat to Britain. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Japanese forces, over 1,500 strong, recently massed around Twenty‑Li Ridge (south of Jie County) launching a major southward offensive. On the afternoon of the 13th, they seized Monanbo and planned further incursions. Chinese forces are advancing to meet them. (Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) On the afternoon of the 13th, over a thousand Japanese captured Monanzhen. Chinese forces exploited the enemy’s unsettled position, attacked from both flanks, and forced the Japanese to withdraw overnight to Twenty‑Li Ridge. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Zhangye – In northern Jiangxi, since the 11th, Japanese forces have attacked the area around Boyu Mountain northwest of Jing’an and Anyi. Chinese troops engaged them separately, fighting fiercely for several days. Japanese assaults repeatedly failed. By dawn of the 15th, the Japanese, with over 200 casualties, were in disarray and retreated. Chinese forces captured considerable booty. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) An officer returning from the front told reporters that in the battle east of Yicheng, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. After five days of bloodshed, over a thousand casualties were inflicted. It was reported a Japanese regimental commander was killed. When the Japanese broke out of Huojia Pass (northwest of Zhangma), they were in a rout. Part retreated to Yicheng, part to Houma. Upon arrival in Houma, a Japanese commander refused the fleeing troops entry, addressing them that they had been defeated by Chinese and that poor discipline and harassment of locals, resulting in failure to gain civilian support, was one cause of the defeat. He questioned how they could face Lieutenant General Niu Dao’s divisional commander. That night the commander committed suicide. The Japanese in Houma were thrown into such confusion that they were leaderless. (Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) Along the Xinqiang–Jiuling River Front near Yixiang, only sporadic artillery duels have occurred in recent days. Chinese mobile units operating behind Japanese lines continue attacking Japanese supply lines, achieving some successes. At Nanlin Bridge on the Chongqing–Tongren route, Chinese and Japanese armies are fiercely locked in battle. Meanwhile, in the Linxiang–Yueyang–Tongcheng area, Japan is dumping its goods, prompting bans on British and American merchandise. Political officers in the Chinese front have mobilized to wage economic guerrilla warfare against these operations, mainly to stop Japanese goods from breaching Chinese defenses and entering the rear. (Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) In Jiaodong, Chinese forces have assaulted Japanese troops at Pingdu for several days. Remaining Japanese in the suburbs have been mopped up. All four passes are fully under control. Japanese holdouts are defending to the last in the city and are under fierce Chinese siege. Another Chinese unit has advanced on Yexian; the Japanese there, entrenched in the city, are surrounded and facing heavy attack. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Over 500 Japanese, accompanied by light artillery, moved out this morning from Taiping Field along the Panyu–Guangzhou Road. By 7:00 a.m. they seized Nantou; by 9:00 a.m., Shenzhen fell. Six Japanese aircraft simultaneously bombed Shenzhen. Many refugees fled into the British area at Luohu. It is reported that before occupying Shenzhen, the Japanese notified the Hong Kong government. This morning British Indian troops were ordered to strengthen border defenses. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Lianxian – Thirty Japanese aircraft this morning reconnoitered the northeastern counties of Guangdong in three squadrons. The first disturbed counties including Wengyuan, Longmen, and Lianping. The second, nine planes, dropped multiple bombs on Yingde County town. The third, eighteen aircraft, conducted reconnaissance near Yinzhanyao and Puohu. (Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Shandong Province Revolt En Masse</h3>
<p>A location in Shandong – Puppet troops in Shandong Province have been defecting in droves in recent days, like spring bamboo shoots after rain, beyond the Japanese Army’s control. Recently, Han Bingzhen led over a thousand men in defection, clashing fiercely with the Japanese and killing over 200. Yesterday, Huang Aijun again slew several Japanese liaison officers, defecting with over 1,500 men. All units have been taken into Chinese service to await orders to strike the Japanese. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Crash at Baotou</h3>
<p>Wuyuan – Reliable news: A Japanese aircraft based in Baotou recently encountered difficulties shortly after takeoff and was forced down, destroyed, killing the pilot. (Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Planes Bomb Cixi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Jinhua – At 7:20 this morning, two Japanese aircraft intruded over Cixi, dropping seven bombs on the city area, including Cihu Middle School, destroying 29 houses and injuring seven. They then proceeded to Guanhaiwei, dropping five more bombs, demolishing 14 houses, killing seven and wounding twenty. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Higher Examinations Postponed</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Examination Yuan’s published schedule for this year’s higher civil service exams—initial test dates, regions, sites, categories, and special measures—has been announced. Due to wartime transport difficulties preventing many candidates from arriving on time, the initial exams have been postponed from September 20 to begin October 11. Test centers remain in the seven regions of Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guilin, Chenggu, Lanzhou, and Yongkang. (Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Confess in Letter to Governor, Admitting True Assassins of Inspector Cheng Xigeng; Pledge Surrender in Hong Kong if Granted Fair Trial to Exonerate Tianjin Suspects</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) This evening two Chinese men presented documents to the Reuters office here—draft open letters addressed to Sir Thomas Fisher, Governor of Hong Kong, and Sir Archibald Kirkland, British Ambassador to China—admitting they were the real assassins of Tianjin Customs Supervisor Cheng Xigeng. Signed Zhuo Zhongliang and Yuan Hanzhong (phonetic), the letters state that if they receive a fair trial and are not handed over to the Japanese, they will surrender themselves to British authorities in Hong Kong to clear the four Tianjin suspects. Several Chinese-language newspapers have received similar letters, though many reporters are skeptical. Supporters view these letters as a brave gesture aimed at preventing the extradition of the four suspects. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Some Hopes for Stabilizing the Foreign Exchange Black Market</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai black market exchange rate narrowed to four to the pound sterling, market prices have been in constant flux. Such volatility is rare in any phase of the year‑and‑a‑half‑old black market. Precisely because this instability is uncommon, we can be confident it does not reflect a lack of enforcement but rather that policy decisions to stabilize have yet to be made. Hong Kong dispatches show that Ms. Rogers, associated with the Exchange Stabilization Fund, after inspecting Shanghai’s financial markets, is in talks with relevant authorities. Rumors also suggest an Anglo–Chinese new currency plan is under discussion. Regardless of the outcome, we believe the authorities will adopt more effective measures to bolster the fiat currency’s defensive strength during the war.</p>
<p>A falling black market rate does not weaken the overall foreign exchange foundation of the fiat currency but rather imposes pressure on Japan. The occupying Japanese not only reap large customs revenues but also purchase foreign exchange on the black market. Even the yen trading in Shanghai is masked within the fiat currency’s foreign exchange black market. A depreciating black rate yields fewer foreign exchange proceeds for Japan and forces the yen to fall further—correct. Yet repeated black rate declines benefit speculators who profit unfairly, fueling malicious rumors about the currency and encouraging capital flight. Furthermore, while a lower black rate can boost exports, price instability may prompt traders to adopt a wait‑and‑see approach. Thus, stabilizing the black market warrants further consideration.</p>
<p>The black market’s development to this stage is due not only to Japanese plunder but also to speculators in Hong Kong and Shanghai. The £10 million Anglo–Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund was established only in early April—barely three months ago—and in half a year, the country’s trade deficit was only 100 million yuan, equating to less than £3 million. Even if the fund had released £5 million to stabilize the market, nearly half would have been consumed by pointless speculation. Hence, although the trade deficit matters, the true culprit is speculators. The stabilization fund was meant to support legitimate traders, yet now benefits malicious speculators—a regrettable outcome.</p>
<p>That Japan and speculators can operate in the black market stems from its laissez‑faire nature. The fund’s past objective was only to maintain a price equilibrium, without vetting the purposes of foreign exchange purchases. Consequently, funds were wastefully dissipated, and the currency’s defensive strength was never fully realized. We believe the purpose of stabilizing the black market is to support legitimate trade and bolster the currency’s credibility. Therefore, going forward, the proposed measures should address:</p>
<p>1. The black market represents a leakage of the fiat currency. Whatever its rate, malicious actors can drain currency for foreign exchange, depleting resources critical to the war and harming honest traders. Allied banks must cooperate with the Chinese government by withdrawing support from the black market.</p>
<p>2. Wherever the fiat currency circulates, it secures international trade. Undermining it undermines all trade. Allies, including Britain and America, should assist China by strengthening the fiat currency’s defenses, aligning with their vested interests and support for China’s war effort.</p>
<p>3. Foreign exchange must be subject to proper vetting—a principle the Chinese government has pursued for a year and a half and one allies should understand. This aligns with economic theory and aids legitimate trade. China supports foreign commerce but refuses to provide opportunities to malicious speculators. If any government insists on maintaining a black market, it must adopt the same vetting procedures as China so that genuine traders obtain necessary foreign exchange.</p>
<p>4. Finally, to reinforce the currency’s defenses, speculation and capital flight must be curbed, and the rate stabilized at a fixed level.</p>
<p>The ultimate foundation of the fiat currency lies in China’s immense wealth, which remains unshakable. Already, in wartime conditions, the fiat currency has outperformed the yen. When victory arrives, the black market will wither. For now, however, a sound policy to stabilize the black market can further solidify the currency’s foundation.</p>
<h3>Chinese Currency System Issue Under Discussion by Britain, France, and the U.S.; British Press Advocates Rebuffing Japanese Ambitions; Rumors of New Currency Plan Unfounded</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports no change in discussions over China’s currency system. Britain continues consultations with France and the U.S. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Today’s Financial Times states that China’s fiat currency situation is among the most difficult financial issues ever faced, even more thorny than any exchange troubles of the past twenty years. The currency’s depreciation severely hampers Britain’s remaining trade in China. However, the root cause lies more in military than economic factors. The Stabilization Fund has worked well, but its recent decline shows that efforts to maintain eight pence in June or six and a half pence in early July were futile. The fund’s inception owed largely to British efforts. Britain has exerted great efforts on its own and allied interests in the Far East. Its lack of success has provoked serious repercussions in Japan, albeit passively satisfying them. We cannot expect Britain to assist China’s foreign exchange without close cooperation from all relevant nations. We should and can refuse Japanese demands aimed at expanding their limited monetary successes in China and depriving us of our own commercial interests. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Financial circles here admit that in recent days, the National Government’s Finance Commissioner met with representatives of the China–Britain Stabilization Fund to discuss China’s currency future, but no conclusions were released. Rumors that China will abandon the silver standard and rely on foreign capital for a new currency plan are entirely unsubstantiated. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Military Attaché in Japan Returns Home Unconnected to Tokyo Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reports that Major‑General Pickard, Britain’s military attaché in Japan for thirty‑five years, will depart via Canada on November 3 for London. His trip is unrelated to the Anglo–Japanese round‑table talks, during which he served as translator. The paper quotes him saying he does not wish to discuss politics and hopes the Anglo–Japanese dispute will find a peaceful resolution before his return. Having lived in Japan so long—his father was a legal advisor to the Japanese government—he came at five, returned to Britain at eight, and served as lieutenant‑translator during the Russo‑Japanese War. In 1910, he returned as assistant attaché and was promoted to attaché in 1936. Considering his long tenure, he regards Japan as a second home and feels little sadness over leaving. His successor will be Lieutenant‑Colonel Murray, who has been in Tokyo three years as translator. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Defenses Quite Thorough; Capable of Withstanding Blockade</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph today published a letter from Colonel Weir, an authority on Far Eastern military affairs, asserting that Hong Kong is not as undefended as some imagine. Defenses are very thorough, and the garrison strong enough to withstand a complete blockade for at least nine months. Hong Kong possesses fixed and mobile gun positions and submarines sufficient for sea combat, and forces adequate to prevent enemy landings or long‑term continental offensives spanning months or years. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>North China Floods Disrupt Japanese Military Transportation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tientsin dispatches report that flooding in North China has gravely disrupted Japanese military transport. The Pingzhuang–Suizhong, Pinghan, Beining, and Jinpei railways were washed out, the Pinghan line most severely. Passenger service between Pingbao and Pingshi resumed only reluctantly on the 13th, while the northern section of the Jinpu line is again broken. Tens of miles of torrents near Yangliuqing and Jinghai span the horizon, forcing passengers and goods to be ferried by civilian boats. Persistent rains in eastern Hebei have inundated sections of the Beining line. Trains scheduled to reach Tientsin on the 15th failed to arrive. With railway transport interrupted, Japanese forces suffer supply shortages and guerrilla ambushes, leaving them in dire straits. On road networks, garrisons of only two to three hundred men are now isolated. Near Tientsin, Japanese units at Wen’an and other locales have already been annihilated by Chinese forces.

<h3>American Expat in Tianjin Slapped by Japanese Soldier; U.S. Consulate Submits Written Protest; Demands Punishment of Offending Soldier; Guarantee of No Further Attacks on Americans</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Acting U.S. Deputy Consul General in Tianjin, Mr. Berg, delivered a written protest to the Japanese Consulate today regarding yesterday’s incident in which Mrs. Liquet (aged 59) was slapped by a Japanese sentry. The American note demands that the Japanese side guarantee their soldiers will no longer attack American citizens and requests punishment for the Japanese sentry involved in Mrs. Liquet’s case. Reportedly, when Mrs. Liquet returned to the British concession yesterday carrying some vegetables, a Japanese sentry slapped her. The sentry refused to acknowledge her U.S. nationality certificate or the pass issued by the Japanese Vice‑Consul. When she was forced into the inspection room for questioning, a Chinese man present was compelled to remove his trousers. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) Reports state that Mrs. Liquet, an American expatriate in Tianjin, was slapped by a Japanese sentry upon entering the French concession. The State Department has recently instructed its embassy in Japan to investigate the circumstances so as to respond appropriately. (August 15, Havas)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A representative from the Japanese Consulate informed a Reuters correspondent this afternoon that the U.S. Consulate lodged a written protest with the Japanese Consulate this morning concerning the slapping of Mrs. Liquet by a Japanese soldier. The requests were: (1) a guarantee that no American woman will be insulted in the future; (2) punishment for the responsible soldier. According to this source, the consulate will soon express its apologies. This matter does not hinge on whether Mrs. Liquet’s U.S. nationality certificate was valid. Mrs. Liquet frequently used this certificate to pass through border checkpoints. On the day of the incident, two Japanese sentries initially allowed her to pass with that certificate. When she presented a pass issued by the Japanese Vice‑Consul for the third inspection, a conflict arose because she refused to allow the soldier to read the text on the pass. A dispute ensued, the soldier became enraged, and struck her. (August 16, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peking) According to today’s reports, the Japanese Embassy has apologized to the American Embassy for the incident on Monday in which an American elderly woman was slapped by a Japanese sentry. A Japanese military spokesman further commented that, in carrying out their duties, Japanese sentries are entitled to take any actions they deem necessary. However, he reminded reporters that Japanese soldiers are, after all, very straightforward and blunt. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Weekly Battle Report — August 8 to 14 —</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that since this week’s operations began, Japanese forces along all fronts seem increasingly exhausted. As the full‑scale war of resistance enters its second year, our armies and officers, defending the country with iron and blood, are more determined and courageous. The active operations of our large guerrilla forces behind enemy lines and the repeated setbacks suffered by the enemy on various battlefields fully demonstrate that the enemy has fallen into an inextricable dilemma. The course of operations is summarized below:</p>
<p>Shanxi Front</p>
<p>Since the enemy’s defeat in southeastern Shanxi, they have continued to stir and struggle on three sides—east, south, and west—this week. In eastern Shanxi, after capturing Changzi, our forces recaptured Gaoping and have pressed the remaining enemy toward Jincheng. More than ten thousand enemy troops divided into six routes through Huoxian, Zhaocheng, Hongtong, Anze, Fushan, Yicheng, and Sixian to encircle Jincheng. We struck them on separate routes, fighting bloody battles for several days. All enemy columns were routed, and the situation is now at a standstill. In southern Shanxi, enemy forces at Anyi, Yuncheng, and Yongji repeatedly attacked our positions, engaging in fierce battles at Zhangdian Town, Dongcun, and Wangbei, but our troops held firm and even briefly recaptured Zhangdian Town, inflicting heavy casualties. In western Shanxi, enemy forces from Lishi divided into four routes advancing westward, attempting to cross at the Liulin ford. We intercepted them on separate paths, dealing them a severe blow. We have now occupied major positions at Mount Heng, cutting off the enemy’s retreat and throwing them into panic. Overall, the enemy’s plans to support operations in eastern Shanxi have been rendered impotent by our firm resistance.</p>
<p>Henan Front</p>
<p>After our victories in southeastern Shanxi, the enemy remnants from Jincheng used Lin County in northern Henan as an important outer base, but Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on Henshui (east of Daxian) and, with a flanking force, severed the enemy’s communication lines at Shuiye, forcing them to flee. The Lin County communication routes were thus cut off. Seizing the moment, we launched a vigorous assault on Lin County itself, causing isolated enemy troops to retreat northward, and the county was retaken. In eastern Henan, Japanese forces at Chenliu, Tongxu, and Huaitaixian sent out detachments on multiple axes over consecutive days, suffering many casualties. We thoroughly disrupted their communication lines and advanced on Kaifeng, reaching Nankai, where a detachment penetrated the city walls and, after street fighting, demolished Japanese military installations with explosives before withdrawing safely. In southern Henan, enemy remnants at Changtaiguan remain tightly besieged by our forces; successive engagements have yielded captures. One of our guerrilla detachments also bypassed to attack the Japanese positions at Liulin’s Wusheng Pass, striking from north and south, shaking the enemy’s morale. Intense fighting is now unfolding.</p>
<p>Hubei Front</p>
<p>In northern Hubei, Chinese forces on successive days intercepted advancing Japanese columns along multiple routes. By the afternoon of the 8th, we recaptured Anju Town, killing over 600 Japanese soldiers, and shifted from defensive to offensive operations, pursuing the enemy vigorously. We successively seized Lishan, Gaocheng, Qigudian, Liangshuigou, and Junchuandian, advancing to Suixian and surrounding the enemy from east and west, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese attack on Zaotai and Jintu was completely shattered. In central Hubei, Japanese troops advancing via Qianjiang Duobao and Luohansi were met with spirited Chinese resistance, repelling them with over 400 enemy killed and sinking more than 30 boats. Capitalizing on our success, we captured positions near Zhongxiang, including Huangcheng Temple and Zhangjiatai; the east bank of the Han River is now entirely under our control. In southern Hubei, Japanese forces concentrated at Mushigang, Bainiqiao, Nanlinqiao, and Tingsiqiao have faced fierce assaults by our troops. Mushigang’s streets were stormed, leading to street battles with heavy enemy casualties. The Japanese at Bainiqiao and Nanlinqiao remain surrounded and are being annihilated. Tingsiqiao was briefly captured by us on the night of the 11th, and the enemy command post was blown up. For a time, traffic on the Xiang–E line was completely disrupted.</p>
<p>Guangdong Front</p>
<p>Along the Beijiang River line, fighting has been relatively quiet, but at Chao’an on the Dongjiang River on the morning of the 9th, six Japanese aircraft supported an assault on Fengxi. Our forces resisted bravely, and after fierce fighting until about 8 p.m., the enemy, unable to press their attack, retreated along their original route. We pursued them, reaching the southwestern two passes. The enemy stubbornly held their defenses until the morning of the 10th, when we demolished their barracks and warehouses with explosives before they withdrew. Along the Xijiang River, enemy patrols continued to harass Zhongshan’s affiliates. On the morning of the 9th, four Japanese warships steamed to Die Shi to shell our positions. That evening, several Japanese vessels on the Mu Chau River attempted a landing but were repelled. Separately, Japanese naval infantry landed from Chichawan to Nanshan, south of Bao’an, and advanced on Bao’an County. Outnumbered, our troops initially fell back, but reinforcements arrived, mounted a counterattack, and completely routed the Japanese, who fled back to their ships via Nanshan. The county was retaken, dealing a serious blow to Japan’s plan to seize Bao’an and threaten Zhongshan’s rear. Elsewhere, battles this week yielded important victories: in Suiyuan, Japanese troops advancing from Baotou toward Anbei were repelled; in Shandong Province, fierce attacks on Mongyin outskirts; in northern Jiangsu, our forces captured two positions outside Xiaoxian, killing over 500 Japanese; in southern Jiangsu, three columns of Japanese advancing on Jintan were utterly defeated; in southern Anhui, we recaptured Jiangyao and stormed Tongling’s Pailou suburb; in Zhejiang Province, we advanced on Jiaxing and Jiashan, repelling Japanese landings at Xiangshan and besieging Xin City; in northern Jiangxi, we broke through the Japanese lines at Ruichang; in northern Hunan, we sank several Japanese boats on Lake Lu Jiao. These are the significant results of the past week. (August 15 dispatch)</p>
<h3>Economic Warfare in Southeastern Guerrilla Zone Intensifies</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) A cable from Chongqing reports that economic warfare in the Southeastern Guerrilla Zone is intensifying. Gu Zhutong has submitted a petition to the central government requesting that the Ministry of Economic Affairs establish an office in that zone to centralize authority in order to further strike at the Japanese side. It is reported the candidate has already been selected and will depart soon. (August 16 special cable)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Deploys Large Forces, Bolsters Siberian Defenses; Air Force Conducts Bombing and Target‑Practice Drills; Reports of Reprimand for General Studen Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to various reports, the Soviet government, in view of recent developments near the border between Outer Mongolia and Manchukuo, has dispatched a large number of troops eastward to various garrisons in Siberia, strengthening the Far Eastern Red Army. All passengers coming from the Far East are being rerouted to Svyatrolovsk (east of the Ural Mountains), where troop movements have been observed to be extremely busy, though no similar activity has been seen west of there. Furthermore, the August 6 issue of Khabarovsk’s Krasnaya Zvezda reported that General Popov, commander of the First Far Eastern Army, on the one‑week anniversary of the Zhanggu Ridge incident, issued a letter to the army’s officers and men. The paper also published a congratulatory telegram from General Studen to the First Army, indicating he has not been reprimanded and remains Commander‑in‑Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, while General Popov continues as commander of the First Army. (August 15, Havas)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Pacific Air Force is reportedly conducting bombing and gunnery target‑practice exercises near Vladivostok and over the Sea of Japan. Similar exercises are taking place in Leningrad and Moscow in preparation for a nationwide joint air drill to be held on Aviation Day, August 18. (August 16, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Discuss Scope of Agreement; Soviet Pushes to Extend to Far East; Staff Talks Kept Confidential</h3>
<p>(London) According to today’s reports, at last night’s staff talks among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet side raised the question of the Far East: in the event Japan attacks the Soviet Union and receives aid from the Axis powers, what stance would Britain and France adopt? Although this topic closely relates to European issues, the British and French military representatives felt it exceeded the scope of their discussions and decided to defer it, focusing instead solely on European matters. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Staff officers from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been in talks since the other day, meeting daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. At the head of the table sit British Chief Representative Admiral Pound‑Geddes, French Representative General Dumont, and Soviet People’s Commissar for Defense Marshal Voroshilov, with other delegates seated behind to provide consultation as needed. According to British and French sources, the talks are being kept strictly confidential, but the progress is reportedly very satisfactory. (August 15, Havas)</p>
<h3>Soviet Begins Work to Widen Canal between White Sea and Baltic Sea to Allow Passage of Large Warships</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to official announcements here, the Soviet government, noting that the canal linking the White Sea and the Baltic Sea is too narrow even for medium‑sized Soviet warships, has begun active work to widen it, aiming for completion in the shortest possible time.

<h3>U.S. Press Weighs Prospects for Japanese‑German‑Italian Alliance and Far East Situation</h3>
<p>(New York) A cable from New York indicates that today’s editorial in the Journal of Commerce stated that Japan seeks a military alliance with Germany and Italy in the hope of seizing the Shanghai concessions, Hong Kong, French Indochina, and the Dutch East Indies at a time when Germany and Italy are preoccupied squabbling with Britain and France. If the European war drags on, Japan may even capture the British stronghold of Singapore. Then not only would the Philippines fall under Japanese control, but Japan’s Greater East Asia Co‑Prosperity Sphere would become reality. However, whether such benefits will truly follow a Japanese‑German‑Italian military alliance is highly questionable. Once the Allied fleets destroy the Italian navy in the Mediterranean and, with Soviet cooperation, blockade the German navy in the North Sea—Germany, lacking essential raw materials, may be forced to surrender. The U.S. Navy could then freely move to the Far East, not only defeating Japan’s inferior navy but also implementing a cordon policy to sever Japan’s vital lifelines of raw materials and maritime trade, potentially ending Japan’s capacity to fight. Such an outcome would be hard for Japanese militarists to believe, hence they continue to indulge in fanciful hopes about a German‑Italian alliance. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British Transport Union Demands Tougher Stance on Japan</h3>
<p>(Gibraltar) The executive committee of the Transport and General Workers’ Union today passed a resolution urging the government to take stronger and more decisive action to prevent continued Japanese breaches of international law in China. A copy of this resolution has been sent to Prime Minister Chamberlain. (August 16, Reuters)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Proposes Ban on Arms Shipments to Japan; State Department Drafting Reply</h3>
<p>(New York) Senator Homer T. Bone, a Democrat from Washington State, recently sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull advocating that American arms manufacturers be advised not to ship munitions to Japan. Regarding this suggestion, Undersecretary Welles recently stated in a speech that the State Department is preparing a reply, but he did not disclose its contents or the date it will be issued. (August 16, Havas)</p>
<h3>Strong Anti‑Japanese Sentiment in the Philippines; Anti‑War Art Exhibition Closure Postponed</h3>
<p>(Manila) This morning, local police sent officers to the Chinese War of Resistance art exhibition venue, requesting that anti‑Japanese leaflets calling for a boycott of Japanese goods not be distributed. The organizers, who largely support the boycott, informed the officers that no such leaflets had been distributed and that they could be prepared by 6 p.m. If the police wished to make arrests, they might do so then. At about 6 p.m., Filipino and three American participants (two of them women) began distributing anti‑Japanese and boycott leaflets in front of the venue for over an hour without police interference. The organizers then announced the conclusion of the event and said they would distribute more leaflets tomorrow. These pamphlets contain quoted statements by Sir Hugh Selwyn, Mohandas Gandhi, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, Canadian Prime Minister King, and various Western public groups urging a boycott of Japanese goods. According to Mr. Lopez, secretary‑general of the “Friends of China” Association, the Chinese War Resistance exhibition was scheduled to close today, but it has been decided to extend it to Saturday. It is said that since the opening, 75,000 people—mostly Filipinos—have visited, with 33,000 signing petitions to the new U.S. Commissioner in the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, urging the severance of trade ties with Japan. Donations for Chinese war refugees have reached 3,000 pesos. However, eight photographs depicting Japanese military atrocities, taken by the police, have yet to be returned.

<h3>Japan to Purchase Modern Aircraft from the U.S.</h3>
<p>(Santa Monica) According to a statement by the Douglas Aircraft Company yesterday, the Japan Air Transport Company has signed a low‑priced contract worth US$715,000 to purchase one of the only available Douglas DC‑4‑2424 modern aircraft. This plane is the largest land‑based commercial aircraft in the world and was recently test‑flown by the U.S. Army with satisfactory results. Company sources say this aircraft will not be converted for military use. They also noted that talks between Japan Air Transport and Douglas began 18 months ago, and before signing, they learned the U.S. government had no objections. Other reports indicate that Japan may also purchase the manufacturing rights for the aircraft for US$10 million. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) Concerning the Douglas Aircraft contract with Japan Air Transport, the State Department issued a statement last night saying that these negotiations began before Secretary Hull implemented his “moral embargo” on Japan. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Large Leather Factory Bombed and Set Ablaze by Anti‑War Elements</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo reports that on the 12th, anti‑war activists threw a bomb into the Dagu Leather Factory, causing a large fire that spread to as many as sixteen nearby factories, resulting in heavy losses. No suspects have been arrested. (August 16)</p>
<h3>Another New Roosevelt Policy: Thanksgiving Date Moved Up; Christmas Shopping Season Extended; Roosevelt Arrives at Halifax Harbor</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt yesterday moved Thanksgiving up to November 23, a departure from the usual celebration on the last Thursday of November. Merchants have welcomed the change, as it extends the Christmas shopping season. However, the New England Association of College Football Officials, calendar manufacturers, poultry farmers, and several governors have opposed the move, citing the sanctity of precedent—such as the tradition against a third presidential term—transmitted from Washington. They have expressed shock at the change and some governors plan not to recognize the earlier Thanksgiving, insisting on their own proclamations. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Halifax) President Roosevelt arrived here yesterday at 11:10 a.m. aboard the cruiser USS Tuscaloosa. The Canadian battery stationed on Citadel Hill fired a 21‑gun salute in his honor. The President is on a North Atlantic holiday tour and yesterday also visited the Roosevelt family summer home at Campobello. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Interior Department has received a petition from 50,000 residents of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, requesting that President Roosevelt run for a third term in next year’s election. (August 15, Havas)</p>
<h3>President of the Indian National Congress to Visit China; Chongqing Preparations Underway</h3>
<p>(Bombay) It has been learned here today that Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the All India National Congress, will fly to Chongqing and Yan’an on August 21, stopping in Rangoon and Hanoi. Yan’an is where the Indian military medical band is stationed. Reports indicate that Chongqing is actively preparing a warm welcome for Mr. Nehru, establishing a special committee to arrange hospitality. He will meet Chinese government leaders, including Chairman Chiang Kai‑shek. (August 16, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Scant Rainfall in Dalian Causes Severe Water Shortage; Residents Suffer</h3>
<p>(Dalian) Over the past ten months, Dalian has suffered from a severe shortage of drinking water, a hardship that has worsened daily. Residents can only obtain fresh water between 7 and 9 a.m., and that water still contains salt and a brackish taste. Since January, only on July 4 was there heavy rain. Local reservoirs are nearly dry. It is said that a nearby new chemical plant has used large quantities of water to fulfill military contracts, leaving very little for the public. Water rationing has been in force since October of last year, with domestic supply gradually reduced to just two hours per day. People use bathtubs and various pots and buckets to store their daily allotment. Chinese water vendors are active, but their water—unless boiled—is unsafe to drink. In addition to the water crisis, Dalian also faces an ice shortage. In the heat, residents pray for a week of continuous rain to relieve them from this ordeal. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Three Areas around Chongqing Designated as County Self‑Government Pilot Zones; Autonomy Plan Drafted by Chiang Kai‑shek; Gan Naiguang and Others Appointed Administrative Commissioners</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Following the decision of the National Defense Supreme Council to designate Jiangbei, Baxian, and Chongqing as pilot zones for county autonomous governments, Gan Naiguang, Wen Qun, and Lai Dian (transliterated) have been appointed administrative commissioners of these zones to oversee implementation. It is reported that the county autonomy plan was drafted by Chairman Chiang Kai‑shek, aiming to make the county an independent unit within the political organization and to allow every citizen to participate in county governance. The expanded organization of county consultative councils also seeks to deepen ties between the Kuomintang and the autonomous governments. (August 16, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>China Industrial Development Company Established in Chongqing</h3>

<h3>Italy Publicly Backs Germany’s Demand for the Return of Danzig; Asserts Peaceful Avenues Are Not Closed; Germany Clearly Seeks to Gain Without Bloodshed</h3>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here recently declared that the European situation is extremely serious, the likes of which have not been seen since 1918. Foreign Minister Ciano’s recent talks with German Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop constitute the Axis powers’ final warning to the democracies. Democracies should no longer harbor illusions of thwarting Germany diplomatically. To this day, they seem unaware that the Treaty of Versailles has entirely lost its validity, and they still plan to use the Danzig question as a pretext to rally anti‑German, anti‑fascist forces and complete an encirclement policy. They also wish to exploit the Danzig issue to wash away the shame of the Munich Agreement. In truth, this matter concerns the honor and prestige of the German nation, and neither Germany nor Italy will permit the democracies to complete any encirclement plan. While both powers wish to resolve the Danzig question by peaceful means and no avenues are yet closed, the Axis have already issued their final warning. Should the democracies remain obstinate, reject a “fair solution,” and not abandon the encirclement policy, war could break out at any time. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today’s newspapers unanimously assert that the question of peace or war over Danzig lies in the hands of the democracies, and in a novel tone they are calling for a peaceful settlement. Ansaldo, editor of the Telegraph, writes that the gravity of the situation is no less than last September; sooner or later the German government will be compelled to accept the solemn, unanimous decision expressed by the Danzig populace. If the Polish military clique, faced with German annexation, brandishes Chamberlain’s empty blank check, then full‑scale war will ensue. The Italian People’s Daily reports that ninety to ninety‑five percent of all Danzig issues have in fact been resolved; what remains is only the symbolic matter of the state’s coat of arms, or at most a provisional arrangement to ease tensions, which should not be a hardship. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to extremely reliable sources, following recent talks in Salzburg between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Italy has agreed to join forces with Germany in a joint initiative regarding the city of Danzig. This decision has already led German and Italian newspapers to shift their tone, openly backing the German position. German papers had at one time called for revisions to the Austro‑Hungarian treaties of the Versailles settlement, coveting Upper Silesia and the Olza coal region and advocating the partition of Poland. Now they speak only of demanding the city of Danzig. These shifts serve as circumstantial evidence of the two nations’ new decision. Originally, the Italian government, wary of German zeal, was uneasy while Ciano was away. After Ribbentrop’s earnest assurances that Germany had no intention of implicating Italy in any risky ventures, both countries agreed that, in their mutual interest, they should adopt the same strategy with the greatest determination. Germany reasons that if it merely demands the city of Danzig and makes participation in a peace conference its quid pro quo, Britain and France will view this as an opportunity to achieve peace and readily comply, perhaps even causing a split in the Anglo‑French peace front. Ciano largely concurred. The two nations’ attitudes thus fell into unity. Within German political circles there had been fear that the authorities might act unilaterally and invite disaster, but today there is a measure of optimism: should Germany be willing to attend a peace conference, it could shatter the resistance of Poland and its allies, making the return of Danzig a nearly foregone conclusion. And if the conference fails, the peace front would certainly collapse, making any subsequent Axis action all the more feasible. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today’s L’Ordre carries an article by Bertin discussing the visit of Professor Bechardt, League of Nations High Commissioner to Danzig, to meet Hitler. Bertin describes this as a new German movement toward the bloodless acquisition of the Free City of Danzig, and asserts that all Germany asks of Commissioner Bechardt is to convey its new scheme for obtaining tangible benefits without resorting to war. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Danzig Question: Germany Has Made No New Proposals; League Commissioner’s Report Under Close Study by Britain and France</h3>
<p>(London) Sources close to the British government express concern over the evolving European situation. The report by League Commissioner Bechardt on his meeting with the German leader is now being closely studied by Foreign Secretary Halifax and experts at the Foreign Office. It is generally speculated that, since Halifax serves as chairman of the Tripartite Commission administering the Free City of Danzig, he may seize this opportunity to convene a commission meeting to discuss Bechardt’s report. According to the Daily Express, Prime Minister Chamberlain may return from Scotland next week and call an early cabinet meeting to address the matter. As for rumors that the Danzig question could be resolved through negotiation and peaceful means, The Times correspondent reports that nothing of the sort has been heard here; in any case, if negotiations were held without Polish participation, the results could never be satisfactory. (16th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) According to last night’s information, during his meeting with Commissioner Bechardt last Friday, Hitler stated that returning Danzig to Germany was the German government’s minimum demand under the present European situation. Hitler also agreed that Germany would grant Poland a free maritime outlet within Danzig’s territory. He made no new demands to Bechardt; their discussion lasted less than half an hour, with Hitler doing all the talking while Bechardt sat silently listening. After receiving Bechardt’s report yesterday, the British government forwarded it to France and Sweden, as both are members of the League’s Danzig Commission. A British government spokesman declared last night that Britain had received no peace proposals from Germany, nor had Bechardt come to London. As of last night, there are no signs of a peaceful resolution to the Danzig question, though all nations continue to study the path to peace. (16th, UPI)</p>
<p>(Paris) League Commissioner Bechardt’s recent talks with Hitler were reported to the British government, which then informed the French Foreign Ministry; the report is now under close study by the responsible departments. Officials refuse to divulge details beyond stating that Hitler explained Germany’s views on Danzig to Bechardt in language identical to his public orations, without offering any proposals for a solution. Britain and France have repeatedly declared that, no matter what diplomatic tactics or propaganda Germany employs, their stance will not change. Germany is actively taking military measures, conscripting reservists, and has increased its army to over two million men, a development to which France must pay utmost attention. Foreign Minister Bonnet will today receive the British Ambassador Capron and the Polish Ambassador Lugashiewicz to discuss the Danzig issue. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Polish Populace Filled with Grief and Wrath, Military Preparations Unremitting</h3>
<p>Warsaw—The conservative Gazeta Krajowa reports that the recent Salzburg talks between the German and Italian foreign ministers have produced no final decision. Berlin is eager to take immediate action on Danzig but has so far been restrained by Rome, which wishes first to secure support from Spain, Japan, Hungary, and Bulgaria. The Polish Courier, the government’s mouthpiece, dismisses proposals to partition Poland as utterly meaningless. Criticizing Commissioner Bechardt’s trip to Berchtesgaden, the Courier declares that the Polish government was entirely unaware of his actions, which were purely his own initiative. According to a semi‑official dispatch by the Polish Telegraph Agency: “Regarding Bechardt’s recent return from Germany to Danzig and rumors of statements in Basel, Warsaw papers uniformly report the nation’s desire to know what Bechardt now intends to do.” At this moment of acute international tension, today’s Polish Army Anniversary celebrations stirred extraordinary fervor: President Mościcki personally inspected troops in Wilno, and military exercises were held nationwide, including in Warsaw. Radio stations broadcast martial songs and marches, and newspapers ran editorials stressing that the Polish people must see themselves as a warrior nation ready to sacrifice their lives for the country.

<h3>Danzig Belongs to Poland, German Intervention Unacceptable</h3>
<p>Warsaw—The Polish Reserve Officers’ Association yesterday passed a resolution calling on all Poles to cease referring to Danzig as the “Free City.” In a declaration, the association explained that there is fundamentally only Polish Danzig, not a “Free City.” The Vistula Delta regions have belonged to Poland for centuries and must never be transferred to another state.

<h3>Berlin Maintains Cautious Stance, Optimism Outweighs Pessimism</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Local conditions suggest that the Danzig situation has suddenly grown calm; press criticism has quieted, though officials are paying close attention to Commissioner Bechardt’s Monday meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden. The true purpose of that meeting remains unknown even to German papers, which published nothing about it, but there is a sense that optimistic elements outweigh the pessimistic. Authorities continue to exercise utmost caution, discouraging rumors of any peaceful plan. Today, Danzig Social Democratic leader Glaeser will meet with Polish Commissioner Zordaki to discuss customs matters. It is reported that large‑scale German mechanized maneuvers, after ten days of preparation, will begin in earnest this Friday. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Poland and Danzig to Hold Direct Talks, Sign of Changing Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Chronicle reports that representatives of Poland and Danzig, together with League Commissioner Bechardt, will hold a roundtable meeting in Danzig today. This development is the result of Bechardt’s journey to Berchtesgaden to meet Hitler. While the general impression is that the situation remains unchanged, the gathering of Polish officials and Danzig Social Democrats at the negotiating table is itself seen as progress. A correspondent for the Daily Telegraph notes that the British authorities, reviewing the latest intelligence, believe that more alarming rumors of a Hungarian threat are intended to divert attention from the German‑Polish dispute; nevertheless, the Danzig corridor remains the true focal point of current international tension.

<h3>Germany Builds Highway in Protectorate to Polish Border, Completion Due End of Month</h3>
<p>Prague—German authorities are actively constructing highways in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia and in the Slovak Region, while seeking to conceal their strategic importance. Originally scheduled for completion at the end of September, the project has been advanced to the end of August. The routes run west to east, directly reaching the border with Poland and the Carpathian Ukrainian Province (formerly Czechoslovakia, now part of Hungary). (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>US Congressman to Propose European Political Truce, Calling for Four‑Power Foreign Ministers’ Conference to Seek Peaceful Solutions to Outstanding Issues</h3>
<p>Oslo—US Congressman Fish of New York, attending the World Conference of Speakers of Parliaments, told Aftenposten that he will tomorrow present a resolution advocating a thirty‑day “political truce” among European nations, during which Foreign Secretaries Halifax, Bonnet, Ribbentrop, and Ciano would convene to resolve Europe’s outstanding disputes. If they cannot reach a compromise, he proposes an arbitration tribunal under King Haakon VII of Norway, King Leopold III of the Belgians, the President of the Irish Free State, and President Baumann of Switzerland to render a binding decision. Mr. Fish revealed that he discussed this plan with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg. (16th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Le Peuple’s London correspondent reports that, after the Salzburg talks between Ribbentrop and Ciano, a plan has been drafted to resolve European disputes. Reportedly, the German and Italian ambassadors to the Vatican informed the Holy See that ethnic Germans in Poland and Italians in French Equatorial Africa and Tunisia suffer oppression, yet both governments remain willing to resolve Europe’s controversies peacefully. They are preparing to put the following final proposals to Western European states:</p>
<p>1. A thirty‑day period during which all nations agree to refrain from any action, allowing a conference of the four foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>2. Each minister shall seek a solution to the Danzig question and, if necessary, submit it to Poland for consideration.</p>
<p>3. If the Danzig question is settled, the thirty‑day period may be extended so the four ministers can address other outstanding issues.</p>
<p>They hope Western European states will accept these terms to pacify the international situation and seek the Vatican’s spiritual support for their success. (16th, Havas)</p>
<h3>League Commissioner’s Remarks</h3>
<p>Danzig—League Commissioner Bechardt, after his meeting with Hitler, returned here yesterday. He told reporters: “I held a brief conversation with the German leader at Berchtesgaden, during which we discussed various internal affairs of the Free City of Danzig. After this talk, I have not abandoned hope for a peaceful solution to the Danzig problem. Reports that I visited Geneva to meet Secretary‑General Joseph Avenol or that I will soon go to London are entirely unfounded. The Polish Commissioner Zordaki and the city council chairman Glaeser will meet tomorrow to discuss certain local matters.” (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw—Official sources here state that Bechardt’s talks with Hitler were purely in his private capacity, with no prior knowledge by the Polish government. Rumors that Foreign Secretary Bonnet assigned Bechardt a “special mission” are false and represent German propaganda aimed at undermining Poland’s position. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Coercion Tactics to Force Hungary into Alliance</h3>
<p>Berlin—Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky, currently near Salzburg, is being hosted by Interior Minister Frick and may meet again with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Informed circles report that Hungary’s accession to the Axis Pact remains under consideration. “Since the recent meeting between Ribbentrop and Csáky,” they say, “the German government has delivered no formal note to Budapest; Hungary must judge for itself the gains of cooperation versus the drawbacks of refusal.” (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Held Firmly by Britain, German Press Voices Opposition</h3>
<p>Berlin—The Eisenbürger Zeitung, mouthpiece of Air Minister Goering, declares that British control of Gibraltar is a threat Spain can no longer and will not indefinitely tolerate. Italy likewise desires that Gibraltar become Spanish territory, since it plays a key role in Britain’s encirclement strategy and in Italian trade with South America and the United States. It will soon be the test of whether Britain can hold Gibraltar against Spain’s increasingly urgent claims. Spain can no longer permanently tolerate British occupation of Gibraltar, just as it once endured the international condominium in Tangier. (16th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Swiss Federal Council Refuses to Resume Relations with Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Bern—The Swiss National Council recently passed a motion advocating recognition of the Soviet Union. After submission to the Federal Council, it was promptly rejected. Furthermore, given the continuing gravity of the international situation, the Council is taking various precautionary measures to ensure civilian food supplies will not be deficient in wartime.

<h3>German Agricultural Study Group Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The German agricultural delegation led by former Agriculture Ministry official Moritz has arrived to visit the Soviet agricultural exhibition. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>King of Romania Declares Determination to Preserve Independence, Asserts Romania and Turkey Already Bound by Military Cooperation, No Need for Additional Treaties</h3>
<p>Bucharest—King Carol II, speaking yesterday on Navy Day, warned that any attempt to alter Romania’s borders would provoke a global crisis. He declared that the Romanian navy stands ready, if necessary to preserve the country, to fulfill its duties to the last. (16th, Havas)</p>
<p>Bucharest—Observers here pay close attention to the King’s speech, noting that the government is sparing no effort to strengthen and train its armed forces. Reserve troops are being summoned for service in preparation for exercises, demonstrating Romania’s resolve to maintain its independence. (16th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspaper Tonight reports that Turkey and Romania have signed a military agreement in Ankara stipulating that, in the event of war, Turkish naval and ground forces may be placed under Romanian command. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Ankara—Reports that Turkey has concluded a military agreement with Romania are unfounded, according to Turkish political circles. In reality, a Romanian military delegation is expected to arrive here to consult with Turkish General Staff officers on adjusting mutual cooperation. The resulting misunderstandings have given rise to rumors. In fact, Turkey and Romania are both signatories of the Balkan Pact and are already bound to cooperate, with no need for an additional military treaty. (16th, Havas)</p>
<h3>US Gold Imports Increase in Volume</h3>
<p>Washington—According to Commerce Department statistics, in July the United States imported gold valued at $278,644,761, an increase of $38,194,786 over June and $214,765,106 over July of last year. Silver imports in July totaled $5,530,688, down $9,239,312 from June and $12,795,666 from July of last year. The decline is attributed to the drop in the U.S. purchase price of foreign silver from 4.3 cents per ounce to 3.5 cents. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>During the Parliamentary Recess, Chamberlain Schemes to Fully Implement His Views; Britain Itself Faces Sacrifice; National Sentiment in Deep Unrest; Opposition Prepares a Great Struggle — London Cable</h3>
<p>— Shudi</p>
<p>Currently, the unease and unrest among the British people is truly such that they live in constant fear, unable to endure a single day in peace. Indeed, this state of alarm has persisted here for more than just one day; but it must be emphasized that since the day before yesterday, when Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons, by a majority of 250 votes to 132, rejected the opposition’s proposal to summon Parliament early on August 21, over the past two days the entire nation’s mood has been marked by heightened tension and volatility.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, every method of persuasion, lobbying, and even warning has indeed been exhausted; yet Chamberlain’s mind is wholly made up, with no room for concession or alteration—he is determined to follow his “line” resolutely to the end. Accordingly, to carry out his “line,” he has been compelled to adopt secret diplomacy abroad and oligarchic politics at home. Thus, he intends to suppress absolutely all future confidential diplomatic news, and toward the opposition members in Parliament he plans to adopt a policy of avoidance. The regular parliamentary recess from August 4 to October 3 is therefore something he has long anticipated.</p>
<p>But events often unfold beyond his expectations. Just on the eve of the recess, his so‑called “Tokyo Method”—which he regarded as a diplomatic masterpiece—failed to earn him the title of “Peacemaker,” unlike at the Munich Conference last time. On the contrary, it provoked anger and alarm throughout Britain. Immediately thereafter, under the guidance of enlightened Conservatives such as Churchill and Eden, the Daily Telegraph on a daily basis exposed the then‑ongoing so‑called “Hudeson Peace Plan.” The succession of these two events instantly created a profound atmosphere of unease in Britain. In my personal view as a reporter, this level of anxiety likely even exceeds that on the eve of last year’s Munich Conference—because everyone clearly understands that last year’s sacrifice at Munich was only Czechoslovakia, whereas this time, with the slightest slip, the sacrifice could be the British Empire itself!</p>
<p>As those in Britain who are equally enlightened and farsighted moved to combat and obstruct the Chamberlain Cabinet’s “line,” President Chiang Kai‑shek of China made a powerful statement in support; then U.S. President Roosevelt abruptly and resolutely announced the abrogation of the U.S.–Japan commercial treaties. Beyond their diplomatic impact, these two measures from Britain’s allied friends immediately sent ripples through British domestic politics, lending strong encouragement to those opposing the Chamberlain Cabinet’s “line.” In this way, the forces of public opinion across all of Britain have been mobilized.</p>
<p>Chamberlain’s plan to yield to Japan has thus been halted at the merely “methodological” stage, with no prospect of further progress; what especially disturbs him is that the bold “Hudeson Peace Plan,” once exposed, was immediately declared stillborn.</p>
<p>Chamberlain and his circle are greatly angered by their inability to carry their plan through to completion; refusing to modify their original design in the slightest, they further intend to change their approach and, during the forthcoming two‑month parliamentary recess, press forward with their line. Over these past two days, secret contacts between Britain and Germany have again become frequent. Details remain entirely unknown outside, but one noteworthy event is the secret trip to Germany by one of Chamberlain’s confidants, Lord Kemsley. According to what he told people, the purpose of his trip was to meet with the German Propaganda Minister Goebbels to “exchange articles” with the German press in order to “understand each other’s viewpoints.” Under local control there are four widely circulated British newspapers—Daily Sketeh, Sunday Times, Sunday Graphie, and Sundayh Chronicle and Referee. He stayed in Germany for about three or five days and has now returned to Britain. These so‑called “articles” have not been seen, but rumors have since arisen that Germany’s General Göring plans to visit Britain, and that certain prominent Britons will shortly visit Germany. Although none of this has fully materialized, one can now clearly discern the future direction of the current British government’s diplomacy.</p>
<p>Thus, from the announcement of the “Tokyo Method” and the exposure of the “Hudeson Peace Plan” up until the end of July—approximately ten days—Britain’s enlightened figures, led by Churchill and Eden, have been engaged in an uninterrupted campaign to shorten the parliamentary recess, so that the entire nation may maintain absolute, rigorous surveillance of the present government. Judging by the prevailing atmosphere and the momentum of these influential leaders, they felt confident they could achieve their goal of passing a motion to shorten the recess. Yet at this critical juncture, Prime Minister Chamberlain launched his counterattack.</p>
<p>His first move, on July 31 in Parliament, was to announce readiness to meet France’s request by sending three military representatives to Moscow at once to begin inter‑staff negotiations. This had long been one of the major obstacles preventing an Anglo‑French‑Soviet alliance, and Chamberlain’s circle had consistently refused even to discuss it; now, however, he suddenly proclaimed the dispatch of envoys—a move whose pacifying effect can easily be imagined. Indeed, without such a major initiative, he would have found it almost impossible to stabilize public sentiment so thoroughly unsettled by the “Tokyo Method” and the “Hudeson Peace Plan.” Subsequently, on August 1 and 2, he repeatedly announced other concessions that the British public had demanded but not yet received—such as on old‑age pensions and air‑defense equipment. All of these were naturally intended to calm the public and to fend off the opposition’s proposal to shorten the parliamentary recess.</p>
<p>After meticulous preparation and calculated maneuvering, on August 2 in Parliament Prime Minister Chamberlain, by a majority of 250 votes to 132, successfully defeated the opposition’s proposal to shorten the recess.</p>
<p>On that day, over the issue of a recess differing by only a month and a half, Chamberlain and the opposition leaders truly debated with flushed faces and raised voices; Chamberlain’s anxious and angry demeanor was, in a sense, quite endearing. Yet to an astute observer, it appeared almost comic: by rule, Parliament was scheduled to reconvene on October 3, while the opposition wished to reconvene on August 21. If Chamberlain had no secret plan that he intended to carry out during that interval, why expend such effort over a mere month and a half? The fact is that those in the know in Britain have long understood that the critical period is the Nazi Party’s Nuremberg Rally in early September; their target has been to reconvene on August 21. That, however, strikes at the very heart of Chamberlain’s most painful secret!</p>
<p>Now, as of today, the British Parliament begins its recess. It is said that Prime Minister Chamberlain will return to the countryside to “go fishing”—yet judging by present circumstances, this country retreat may prove even busier than his affairs in his Whitehall office at 10 Downing Street. The main purpose of his departure will naturally be to avoid the unavoidable scrutiny in London. So what will keep him occupied? We cannot say with certainty yet, but one can surmise he will continue to pursue his “line,” and certainly not, as has been loudly claimed these past two days, “to intensify negotiations for an Anglo‑French‑Soviet alliance” or “to maintain close cooperation with the U.S. government.”</p>
<p>But this is no trifling matter! The British Empire itself now stands in grave peril. In recent years, the global rallying cry has been “collective security”—that all nations should join hands to defeat the three aggressor states Germany, Japan, and Italy. Yet since the implementation of the “Chamberlain Cabinet line,” Britain has successively betrayed Austria, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Albania, among others. Up to the present, our most ideal destination remains “collective security.” However, developments sometimes exceed not only people’s hopes but also the bounds of human control. Judging by the current situation, if Prime Minister Chamberlain obstinately continues on his established “line”—such as “attacking the Soviet Union,” “partitioning China and South America,” “dividing up the smaller states of Southeast Europe,” “dismembering Germany, Japan, and Italy,” and so forth—and openly acts on these plans, then the so‑called “collective security” slogan of recent years will inevitably perish one day. What will ensue will not be the disaster of others—but first and foremost the catastrophe of the British Empire itself!</p>
<p>Those in Britain with clear heads are fully aware of this unmistakable trend. Hence the present state of national alarm. Therefore, the British people now regard surveilling the Chamberlain Cabinet as their sole paramount duty.</p>
<p>Although Chamberlain has succeeded this time in retaining the full length of the recess, on the other hand we must point out that those opposing the “Chamberlain Cabinet line” are further consolidating their strength to prepare for the greatest possible struggle against Chamberlain and his circle. At present, all the major newspapers and opinion‑forming bodies have already been fully mobilized; special efforts are intensifying to break through the news blackout that Chamberlain is about to impose, so as to inform the world and the British public of the true facts at any moment. The more influential Members of Parliament have likewise agreed among themselves not to stray far from London, in order to maintain the closest contact and, should necessity arise, immediately press the government to summon Parliament back into session.</p>
<p>In diplomacy, the key objectives they now insist upon are: (1) preventing the government from betraying China; (2) preventing breaches of faith toward Poland and Turkey; (3) strengthening cooperation with the United States; (4) bringing about an Anglo‑French‑Soviet alliance. Fortunately, these minimum objectives are those most widely and unanimously demanded by the British public. Especially the points of cooperating with the United States and aiding China in its war of resistance are broadly accepted and supported throughout Britain. Should any measure by the current government violate these two points, the moment such transgressions are pointed out, a wave of opposition will be aroused sufficient to stop Chamberlain in his tracks. The British reaction in the days following the “Tokyo Method” and the U.S. abrogation of the commercial treaties provides the clearest example of this.</p>
<p>Even so, we must by no means overlook the difficulties faced by Britain’s enlightened, progressive figures in opposing the “Chamberlain Cabinet line” on the domestic front. Though they are unquestionably united in their opposition to Chamberlain’s views and actions, within permissible limits they also strive to avoid appearing “divided” in the eyes of foreigners, lest such division prove counterproductive and hasten Britain’s misfortune. Moreover, those of higher standing who may join the future cabinet—such as Churchill and Eden—must exercise extreme caution; they cannot emulate the uninhibited candor of elder statesmen like Lord George. In Britain’s traditional political climate, those aspiring to the political stage must above all not lose their “gentlemanly bearing.”</p>
<p>Thus the present difficulty lies in how, on the one hand, to maintain their “gentlemanly bearing” and, on the other, to prevent Prime Minister Chamberlain from persisting in his course unchecked—in other words, how not to allow Chamberlain to exploit their “gentlemanly courtesy” to carry out his own oligarchic politics and secret diplomacy.

<h3>Large Rice Hoarders Should Be Compelled by Authorities to Sell; Hoarders Driven Solely by Profit, Disregarding Public Food Supply; Arrival of Wumike‐Type Rice Yesterday Was Overwhelmingly Crowded</h3>
<p>Our paper has, day after day, received letters from readers regarding the recent disorder in the rice market. At the crux, it is said, are certain industry magnates who, with vast capital, have engaged in massive hoarding—stubbornly refusing to release their stock until the price per shi reaches thirty yuan, intent on reaping huge profits and caring nothing for the people’s livelihood—and they should be exposed. This rumor has circulated for some time. According to responsible authorities, since the rice market fell into disarray and faced an informal suspension, ordinary rice shops now have almost no rice to sell, affecting the food supply for the entire city and thus public security in the concessions. Inquiries were made of these hoarders urging them to release their holdings, but the hoarders, speaking earnestly yet ignoring all entreaties, shifted blame and feigned deafness. Even in recent days, when Wumike‑type rice arrived yesterday the crowds were exceptionally dense. Moreover, among merchants and households, those who have stockpiled rice at home are estimated to be numerous, yet rice prices continue to rise without falling. Under these circumstances, authorities must forcibly compel sales to enforce price limits; this is imperative and must be carried out resolutely to reassure the public. Furthermore, examination of rice prices shows that from late spring into early summer they have gradually soared, by mid‑June bursting past the twenty‑yuan mark. At that time, our paper reported the major hoarding activities of speculators and urged the concession authorities not to turn a blind eye but to impose the harshest sanctions on manipulators. By late July, after dark‑market trading was discovered, we also reported that money‑lending institutions should tighten rice‑pledge loans to prevent profiteering by speculators during peak seasons, exposing such practices. As for our periodic reports on rice stocks, once the published quantities proved insufficient to meet the city’s three‑month needs, we feared the figures were inaccurate and therefore did not publish them. Now that the rice market has deviated from normal channels and citizens are anxiously awaiting measures by the authorities to safeguard the food supply, surely there is grounds for comfort and hope.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Crashes; Pilot Killed</h3>
<p>The English‑language Evening American reports that a Japanese Army aircraft, this morning (the 16th) just after 10 a.m., attempted a rapid descent south of Xujiahui, failed to pull up in time, and crashed in the nearby suburbs. Although the exact details of the accident are not yet known, it is reported that the pilot was killed, and no civilians in the area were injured.</p>
<h3>French Police Stations; Precautions Strengthened</h3>
<p>The Zilin News reports that in the French Concession, police stations after 6 p.m. yesterday (the 15th) closed their iron gates. The French police department’s adoption of this measure remains mysterious, and the authorities have remained silent on the matter. According to other sources, however, it is out of fear that terrorists may attack the concession’s police stations—particularly the Central Police Station on Xuehualilu—and thus this exceptional precaution has been implemented.</p>
<h3>Japanese Again Plotting to Undermine the French Currency; Reports All Unreliable</h3>
<p>The English‑language Evening American says that Japanese sources, purportedly relayed from Hong Kong and forwarded by Tokyo to Shanghai, claim that a committee of Sino‑British financial experts in Hong Kong has decided to sever the link between the French franc and foreign exchange and to issue a new currency to finance China’s foreign trade. These claims are not to be lightly believed. According to local banking circles, even if the report were true, it would only indicate that Britain has not ceased its economic assistance to China. Some remain puzzled by the recent secret visit here of Mr. Rogers from the London Bank, formerly of the Hong Kong Sino‑British Stabilization Fund committee; yet those who met Rogers here emphatically state that he did not make any such assertions.</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces Increase on the Eastern Battlefield; Press Supply Lines; Two Divisions Arrive in Mud on the Hangzhou Line; Jinhuai Bridge Town Recaptured</h3>
<p>According to maritime industry sources, the mobile units of China’s regular forces entering the eastern battlefield have been steadily reinforced. In the outskirts of Songjiang, two divisions—the Xth Division and the Yth Division—have been discovered, fully armed and well disciplined. In dealing with civilian vessels entering and leaving the waterways, they conduct inspections only at entry and exit points; any craft confirmed to have no connection with Japanese military operations is not detained but immediately released. These newly arrived troops have not yet undertaken any sudden military actions, but they are gradually advancing to control the rail and road supply lines around Songjiang. Meanwhile, at Jinhuai Bridge Town on the Fengxian border south of Pu, originally garrisoned by a large detachment under Ding Xishan’s command, on August 13 several Japanese motor launches carrying over one hundred troops steamed into Jinhuai Bridge Town, intent on a direct assault. Forewarned, Commander Pei Zilin repositioned his main force to both sides, encircling the attackers on three sides. The Japanese suffered significant casualties and, upon reaching the town, discovered the defenders had already withdrawn—though the surrounding four townships had been seized by guerrilla forces, placing the Japanese in a dilemma. According to confirmed reports, the guerrillas launched a large‑scale counter‑attack the night before last; after fierce fighting, the Japanese, unable to hold their ground, retreated by those same motor launches to outside the sluice port early yesterday morning. Consequently, Jinhuai Bridge Town has once again fallen into Chinese hands.</p>
<p>Special policies or plans are under discussion; they disbelieve the Japanese‑propagated new currency scheme. This morning, the local franc exchange rate weakened: banks opened with sterling quoted at three pence five, and the U.S. dollar at 6.8125 yuan, with no shortage of buyers. The Zilin News reports that at a press reception hosted by the Japanese side yesterday (the 15th), reporters asked the Embassy spokesman about the Asahi Shimbun’s report that Japanese experts believe paying customs duties in francs would incur huge losses and is therefore unacceptable, and what comment he could offer. The spokesman replied that the matter is under consideration, and if the franc continues to fall, adjustments will be made.</p>
<h3>Counterfeits Mixed with Genuine Domestic Goods; Ministry Orders Complete Prohibition; Internal Conditions of State‑Backed Manufacturers to Be Reported Every Six Months</h3>
<p>To safeguard domestic products and prevent the mixing of counterfeits with genuine goods in shipments to the interior, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in September of the 27th year (1938) promulgated rules for issuing Domestic Product Certificates. In view of frequent internal changes among manufacturers who have already received such certificates—making verification difficult without timely inspections—it has now been provisionally stipulated: (1) All manufacturers holding a Domestic Product Certificate must every six months complete and submit a statement of specified matters to the ministry for record; the form is the same as that used in the original certificate application. (2) The completed statement must be submitted via the local supervising authority or certified by a legitimate local industrial and commercial association before being forwarded for approval. All domestic manufacturers in this city, seeing that this concerns the government’s protection of the domestic manufacturing industry, have uniformly complied, submitting their reports on schedule so that the state of domestic production in Shanghai can be clearly understood. In addition, each domestic and trade association has exercised extreme caution in issuing Domestic Product Certificates, to avoid non‑domestic goods entering the interior and undermining the wartime economy.</p>
<h3>Inland Waterway Restored from West Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to maritime industry reports, the inland waterway running west from Shanghai—from Beixinjing via Yejidun (commonly called Wild Chicken Dun), Jiangqiao Town, Hongqiao, Ji Wang Miao, Huangdu, Sigangkou, Baihe River, Kongzhai, Qingpu, and surrounding areas—had been blocked due to guerrilla activity and Japanese defensive deployments. Vessels bound for Shanghai have generally had to detour south via Huangpu Bay. It is now understood that conditions have eased, so yesterday morning from 8 to 10 a.m. more than ten small steamboats of the Public Concession operated on the Suzhou Creek, each towing seven to ten large wooden barges loaded with coal dust and other cargoes westward. From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., a further four to five hundred civilian boats, taking advantage of the tide, sailed westward. At Beixinjing ferry crossing to Caojiadu opposite St. John’s University, inspection delays caused congestion; except for a few small steamboats able to reach Huangdu and lie overnight, the remaining vessels did not fully clear the crossing until evening. Navigation westward will resume at daybreak today.</p>
<h3>Buying Refugee Passes to Spy on Military Information; Incident Discovered, Strict Precautions Ordered; Relief Committee Also Issues Notice of Alert</h3>
<p>According to charitable organizations, in recent days various war zones have discovered that certain parties are buying refugees’ passes and dispatching criminals to infiltrate rear areas to spy on military matters and plot sabotage—actions of great significance to the war. The authorities have ordered strict preventive measures, and the Central Relief Committee has also issued a circular to all relief agencies to exercise special caution in the management and dispatch of refugees.</p>
<h3>Tide Surge Expected to Reach Peak Early This Morning; Possible Flooding; Merchants Have Taken Precautions</h3>
<p>The Huangpu River’s high tide surge began again at 12:46 a.m. yesterday, reaching over twelve feet. Although clear weather prevented overflow onto the banks, low‑lying streets experienced inlet flooding from drains until about 10 a.m., when the water fully receded. Another surge followed at 1:31 p.m., slightly lower than the earlier one. The predicted surge at 1:30 a.m. this morning is thirteen feet, one inch, and five tenths—whereas the Bund’s quay height is only thirteen feet. Thus there is a strong possibility of flooding, warranting close attention. Merchants have already taken precautions.</p>
<h3>Motor Launches at Songpu Mouth Obstruct Sand Barges; Prices Suppressed, Forced Purchases</h3>
<p>All construction‑grade sand and stone in the Shanghai concessions, originally sourced from Shengshan and the Sijiao Islands and transported by various associations’ barges for sale to builders, have recently been subject to control by certain parties. Several motor launches have been dispatched to patrol the Tongshayang area off Wusongkou, intercepting every sand barge and compelling owners to sell at reduced prices to the so‑called “Central China Sand and Stone Company.” As a result, sand and stone supplies to all parts of the concessions are extremely scarce, and businesses throughout Shanghai are in a state of panic.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Control Vegetables Suddenly Reversed; Vendors Stranded, Unsure What to Do</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese authorities in Pudong posted a notice intending that, from yesterday (the 16th), all Pudong vegetables should be diverted to Hongkou for centralized sale. According to investigations, this new measure was abruptly changed yesterday without explanation or prior notice, postponing its implementation. Thus yesterday morning a large number of Pudong vegetable vendors wandered aimlessly along Pudong Boulevard—some planning to go to the Changzhan Wharf, others to the Dongchang Road Wharf—without guidance. After much hesitation, and in the absence of any directive, the so‑called “police station” nonetheless allowed them to board ferries at the Dongchang Road Wharf to enter the concessions as before. Consequently, the vegetable markets saw no shortage yesterday.</p>
<h3>Prohibition on Imported Goods Entering Inland; Postal Bureau Notice Prohibits Forwarding</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1563 states: In accordance with a communication from Kunming Post Office, the items listed in the attached schedule of imported goods are prohibited by local customs from entering the interior provinces. All such items may not be mailed to Yunnan or forwarded to any other provinces. This notice, together with the attached schedule in both Chinese and English, is hereby promulgated for general information. Director Zhao Peilin</p>
<p>The attached schedule categorizes the prohibited goods under: cotton and its products; jute, hemp, ramie, linen, and related products; wool and its products; silk and its products; foodstuffs and beverages; leather and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Provisioning the Isolated Army; Japanese Papers Launch Assault, Saying Japanese Are Quite Indignant and May Immediately Cease Paying Taxes</h3>
<p>According to the Zilin Daily, the local Japanese‑language “Continental News” yesterday (the 15th) published a special war dispatch stating that the Municipal Council’s finances have been exhausted, yet it is maintaining hundreds of Chinese soldiers within the International Settlement at great expense. Japanese taxpayers are reportedly deeply resentful and may immediately stop paying taxes. These Chinese soldiers are the 1937 October remnant force that retreated from Zhabei into the British military defense zone of the International Settlement and were detained in the camp at the corner of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road. Originally numbering 230, their upkeep was initially funded by the Chinese government, but since the fall of Nanjing, no payments have been made. “The Municipal Council hopes to obtain reimbursement from the Chongqing government at some future date, but that is impossible,” the report said. The Japanese, angered that the Council “for so long has protected and maintained Chinese prisoners of war within the Japanese‑controlled zone,” are incensed. Last year, the isolated soldiers clashed with the White Russian unit of the International Merchant Marine Association over flying the national flag, resulting in several casualties. The Continental News did not suggest how the isolated soldiers should be dealt with.</p>
<h3>A Chinese Air Squadron Flies to Wusong for Reconnaissance; Circles in the Sky for Two Hours Without Dropping Bombs; Japanese Forces Panic, Enforce Blackout</h3>
<p>At 9 pm last night (the 15th) at Wusong, the Japanese garrison under Commander Zhang Huabang and the Kinjiro Gendarmerie Command suddenly issued a warning stating that a small squadron of Chinese aircraft—three planes in total—had entered Wusong airspace, flying at considerable altitude and without any sound. They immediately imposed a blackout. At the same time, they notified the Railway Workshops and the Huafeng, Yong’an, and two yarn factories west of Yunzhen Harbor. Upon receiving the report, each factory immediately applied emergency brakes and halted work. The Chinese planes circled the sky for about two hours, apparently on reconnaissance, and did not drop any bombs. After completing their mission, they returned safely to their bases. At 11:30 pm, the Japanese forces ended the alert and all factories resumed operations, though they had been halted for two and a half hours, causing a needless scare. At 8 am yesterday morning, a small warship docked beside the Yangshengguan, departing for Shanghai after 10 o’clock.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Refusing Jewish Refugees; Implementation Still Problematic; Council and Japanese Side Disagree; Residential Locations “Rife with Complications”</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that regarding the Municipal Council’s order issued yesterday (the 15th) to cease admitting German Jewish refugees to Shanghai, many complications have already arisen. The Council’s chief administrator, Philip, met on behalf of the Council at the Japanese Consulate yesterday with Japanese Consul General Miura. When questioned by reporters afterward, Philip declined to disclose the details of their conversation, only stating that “there are many complications.” As for the refugees already en route to China, some say they will be permitted to disembark, while others say they will be refused—no definitive decision has been reached. According to well‑informed sources, the current discussion points are as follows:</p>
<p>Key Discussion Points</p>
<p>• The Municipal Council insists that there is no room for refugees to settle on the south bank of the Suzhou River, but on “humanitarian” grounds, argues they should be allowed to land, provided they reside on the north bank of the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>• The Japanese side, on the other hand, has issued a directive requiring that all European Jewish immigrants already residing in the occupied areas of the International Settlement must register by today (the 16th), after which no residence permits will be issued. For humanitarian reasons, they are willing to allow immigrants into the International Settlement, but only on the north bank of the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>• Yesterday, immigrants flocked to city photo studios to have their photographs taken so they could register before today’s deadline, as last week the Japanese Marines had issued a registration order requiring photographs.</p>
<p>• It is estimated that by today’s deadline, fewer than ten thousand refugees will have registered with the Japanese authorities, and they are already registered at the German Consulate here.</p>
<p>According to the Zilin Daily, when a reporter asked a senior Municipal Council official about the eight hundred fifty Jewish refugees who boarded a Genoa mail steamer yesterday bound for Shanghai, the official replied that nothing has been decided, though there is a possibility of refusing them landing. Meanwhile, there are already fifteen thousand Jewish refugees in Shanghai, and since the Japanese spokesman announced last Friday that no more refugees would be allowed into Hongkou, and then the Municipal Council abruptly announced that future refugees would also be barred from landing here, a great uproar ensued. Shanghai is the only port in the world that imposes no restrictions on Jewish immigration. It was not until Monday afternoon that any limitations were announced, causing many in the refugee shelters—eager for relatives to leave Germany and arrive here this year—to fall into despair at the news of a possible landing ban. This new regulation will separate refugee families, and thousands upon thousands of Jews in Germany have already lost any hope of leaving Germany. However, the public generally believes that since the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities sympathize with the refugees’ plight, they may implement the new rules more leniently. It is reported that the committee responsible for these immigrants is currently studying all the issues arising from these new measures, following the announcement by the Municipal Council and the Municipal Council Board on Monday.</p>
<h3>Yantai Customs Japanese Inspect American Women; US Consulate Alerts American Residents, Urges Precautions</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday (the 15th) news from Yantai indicated that a US Navy petty officer, while riding a rickshaw along the waterfront in Yantai last week, was struck by a Japanese military truck carrying sand. The petty officer and the rickshaw puller were both thrown out; the petty officer suffered a broken nose, severe facial and chest injuries, and lost several teeth. He is currently receiving medical treatment in Yantai. This is the second similar accident in Yantai in the past ten days. Earlier, a US sailor had been crushed by a Japanese military truck and treated in hospital for several days before recovering. Last night, another report from Yantai stated that Japanese personnel at Yantai Customs have begun inspecting American naval officers’ wives departing the port. Last week, an American woman was stopped, her handbag searched, and one hundred US dollars confiscated, as restrictions on carrying currency into and out of Yantai have tightened. Consequently, the US Consulate in that city has notified all American residents to take precautions to safeguard their money.</p>
<h3>American Charitable Transfer Investigation; Relief Situation; Relief Efforts Are Vast, Must Have Accurate Statistics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross yesterday sent letters to all local relief organizations stating: “Our committee has recently received a letter from an American charitable organization commissioning us to investigate, on its behalf, the total expenditures for refugee relief in Shanghai since the outbreak of the Sino‑Japanese conflict. Since the war began, relief organizations in this city have sheltered up to two hundred thousand refugees, and relief expenditures must be enormous. However, due to a lack of close coordination among the various charitable groups, it has been impossible to obtain accurate totals and thus impossible to convey the full scope of the city’s relief efforts. We have therefore written to inquire, via this special letter, that you please fill in the attached form detailing your committee’s total relief expenditures and average refugee numbers from the outbreak on August 13 until the end of June this year, and send it back to us for compilation and reply. If your committee has already published a work report, please send a copy.”</p>
<h3>Rotation of British Warships on the Yangtze</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Rear Admiral E. H. Hart’s flagship, the light cruiser HMS Scorpion, will sail to Hankou together with HMS Wren on the morning of the foreseeable 17th, relieving HMS Scarab as the Yangtze British vessel. The flagship Scorpion will shortly return to Shanghai. Additionally, HMS Osprey sailed for Jiujiang yesterday (the 15th) morning, relieving HMS Aphid.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side’s Plans for Shanghai; Closely Watched by Chongqing; Japanese Military Representatives Return Home for Consultations</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 16th, wireless: Regarding reports from Shanghai that Japan plans to blockade the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession, and that the two concession authorities have already prepared to cope with the situation, local officials are paying close attention. Many predict that Japan intends to drive Chinese out of the settlements into Japanese‑occupied zones in order to exert pressure on the concessions. The Continental Daily reports that last night (the 15th) Japanese‑language newspapers stated that Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, representing the local Japanese military authorities, left Shanghai yesterday for Tokyo to discuss important measures with the government regarding solutions to the Shanghai Settlement issue. Also, Lieutenant Colonels Mitsunobu and Terasaki, representing the local Imperial Japanese Navy and the Consulate authorities, respectively, are scheduled to depart for Tokyo today (the 16th).</p>

<h3>Limiting Shanghai Vessels’ Calls at Ningbo for Passenger Safety</h3>
<p>Limited to Two Shuttle Vessels; Tianbao Dedicated for Transfer; Mofu Returns Excess Cargo to Customs</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai–Ningbo route resumed service with the German firm Leh &amp; Co.’s steamer Mofu first obtaining Ningbo authorities’ approval to anchor outside Zhenhai Harbor and resume voyages, six additional ships—German vessels Ping, New Beijing, Prahara, Hanna, Yingzhou, and Ende—have applied for approval to join the route, making seven in total including Mofu. While New Beijing has also applied, it is currently unloading cargo at Quanzhou and then at Amoy and will not return until today, so the Shanghai–Ningbo service has yet to officially restart. Whether that ship will call at Ningbo after returning to Shanghai remains undecided. However, given the shortage of local shuttle boats—made of wood and of limited carrying capacity—transfers take time, and with the sudden increase of foreign vessels calling at Ningbo, distribution has been inadequate, causing some ships to wait at Zhenhai for over ten days without being able to unload passengers or cargo. Cold and cramped conditions have made the ordeal unbearable for passengers. Moreover, before operations resumed, crowding among passengers vying to board created dangerous situations. It has therefore been decided to charter the vessel Tianbao as a dedicated shuttle for cargo and passenger transfers, ensuring safer and more convenient operations without risk of dangerous waves. The vessel has already commenced shuttle services.</p>
<p>Authorities’ Restrictions on Berthing Order</p>
<p>According to reporters from Daguan News Agency who yesterday inquired within the maritime industry, Ningbo Defense Command, noting the increase in foreign vessels calling at Ningbo and the shortage of shuttle boats, and concerned that crowded transfers among many ships might lead to disputes and accidents, has decided, for the sake of passenger safety, to limit the sequence of Shanghai vessels calling at Ningbo. Regulations now stipulate that only two foreign vessels may transfer cargo and passengers at the outer anchorage at a time; once these two vessels have completed loading and unloading, a second batch may proceed. The command has instructed the Yin County Maritime Association to inform all Shanghai shipping companies to comply and to schedule departure times in advance to avoid arriving at Ningbo and being denied transfer, thus incurring needless losses.</p>
<p>Charter of the Tianbao as Dedicated Shuttle</p>
<p>The German firm Schell &amp; Co.’s steamer Tianbao, which runs the Shanghai–Ningbo route, anchored at Ningbo and suspended service when Zhejiang’s ports fell. With the resumption of the Shanghai–Ningbo line, and to facilitate passenger travel, it has been employed on that route. Given the shortage of Ningbo shuttle boats, authorities have chosen the smaller-hulled Tianbao, which can still enter and exit the break in the Zhenhai harbor blockade line, as the shuttle vessel.</p>
<p>Mofu Calls at Ningbo; Hanna Ports at Shanghai</p>
<p>It is also reported that Leh &amp; Co.’s steamer Mofu was originally scheduled to call at Ningbo on the morning of the 15th, but before departure, the owners discovered excess cargo loading, so they returned five bags of wheat and some sugar to customs and only departed yesterday at 2 pm. Meanwhile, the German firm Far East Company’s steamer Hanna arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday at around 2 pm, carrying numerous passengers and cargo. The German vessel Ping is also scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow, and several others, including Ende and Prahara, have yet to call at Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Effects of Foreign Exchange Collapse; Industrial Contraction</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council’s Industrial Division yesterday issued its summary of July’s industrial situation in this city, excerpts as follows:</p>
<p>Market Impact</p>
<p>Factories have suffered greatly from banks limiting withdrawals, a sharp drop in exchange rates, difficulties procuring raw materials from outside the city, and partial blockades in some areas, leading to widespread contraction in production. The most affected industries are rubber, enamelware, tobacco, hot‑water bottles and glass—each has seen sales decline ever since repeated price hikes, and some have completely halted, reversing previous gains. As for timber, with Zhejiang’s ports blockaded, timber imports have ceased. All sawmills, unable to obtain raw timber and facing soaring prices for foreign lumber, have shut down one after another. Flour mills, however, have ample wheat reserves and grain prices continue to rise, so business remains brisk and production stable. Silk reeling factories, beset by raw material shortages and high prices, fare worse than low‑quality overseas operations, while condiment powder factories are exceptionally busy.</p>
<p>Industrial Accidents</p>
<p>A total of 170 industrial accidents occurred, twelve of which were fatal. There were 42 incidents involving machinery‑driven devices, four fatal; nine electrical shock injuries, four fatal; eight burns from molten substances, four fatal; 35 falls causing injuries, two fatal; and 24 struck‑by accidents. The textile industry saw 36 incidents, the transport sector 18, machinery and hardware 10, the glass industry five. Eighteen fire incidents occurred in industrial facilities: four in garment factories, three each in celluloid and weaving, six each in chemical, woodworking, and machinery sectors.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index</p>
<p>In July, the overall living cost index for workers rose to 188.56 yuan, an increase of 12.41 over June. Compared with July of last year, it increased 20.98%, and compared with 1936, it rose 88.56%. Therefore, one yuan in silver currency that bought goods in 1936 only buys 0.5303 yuan worth now. Compared with last month, the food index rose 9.56%, rent 4.67%, fuel and lighting 5.58%, miscellaneous 0.46%, while clothing fell 0.07%.</p>
<h3>Dark Market for Cotton Yarn Resumes in Compliance with Government Directives</h3>
<p>Trading under the Three Principles of Nationality, Domestic Goods, and Spot Transactions; Strictly Preventing Speculation, Restricting Access</p>
<p>The clandestine cotton yarn market organized by local yarn industry groups has now been reformed to follow the Ministry’s instructions and restrict trading to spot transactions in domestic yarn under the Three Principles of nationality, domestic goods, and spot. Trading resumed yesterday morning at the original venue, with a notice warning speculators not to exploit the situation and announcing planned restrictions on entrance to facilitate monitoring of transactions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Trading</p>
<p>The clandestine cotton yarn market jointly run by the Yarn Industry Association and the Business Research Association had been ordered stopped by the Ministry of Economic Affairs due to some traders dealing in Japanese yarn and futures. To comply with government orders and eliminate speculator activity, the associations held careful discussions and decided to suspend trading temporarily, then resume under the Three Principles of nationality, domestic goods, and spot transactions. Internal matters having been settled, trading officially resumed yesterday morning, and merchants flocked to buy and sell. According to yarn magnate Mr. Tang Ziliang, speaking to a Daguan News Agency reporter, since reopening, the dark market will strictly follow government directives and steadily progress toward completely eradicating improper transactions. He hopes all industry parties will observe this.</p>
<p>Contrary reports that trading has resumed on the second floor of the pseudo‑Chinese Mercantile Securities Exchange are unfounded; the venue remains at the Andar Bank building on Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Preventing Speculation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Yarn Association and Business Research Association jointly posted the following notice at the market: “To all members: Transactions between members must be settled promptly; futures trading is strictly prohibited. Given the market’s price fluctuations, there is concern that speculators may exploit the situation. We hereby solemnly notify all members to abide by their business scope, refrain from futures trading, and focus on domestic goods.”</p>
<p>Restricting Entrance</p>
<p>“To facilitate orderly trading and due to the intense heat that had previously closed the office, operations have resumed now that temperatures have cooled. Effective immediately, all members entering the market must wear their badges; those without badges will be denied entry. The association is now preparing measures to limit the number of people admitted; new membership applications are temporarily suspended. Once the entrance restriction measures are decided, they will be announced separately. This notice is issued to ensure close monitoring of the market—any transactions that violate the Three Principles will be strictly prohibited.”</p>
<h3>Following Vigorously Developing Mineral Resources, Centralized Exports Surge</h3>
<p>Tin, Antimony, and Other Ores Predominate; Exports Now Exceed Prewar Levels</p>
<p>The Finance and Economic Ministries have made great efforts to develop inland mineral resources. Production of antimony, tin, and other minerals has surged; all are controlled by the national government for centralized export from Hong Kong and other ports. Exports in the postwar period have actually surpassed prewar levels. In the first half of this year, mineral exports were valued at 49,960,096 yuan, an increase of 1,209,137 yuan over the same period two years ago. The names, quantities, and values of exported minerals for the first half of this year are as follows:</p>
<h3>Postal Services Fully Restored in All Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Ordinary, Fast, and Parcel Mail Sent as Usual; Japanese Authorities Only Have Inspection Rights</p>
<p>Reported by Daguan News Agency: According to inquiries at the Postal Bureau, postal offices in all occupied areas—from Nanjing to Shanghai, Shanghai to Hangzhou, Nanjing to Anhui, and cities large and small along the upper and lower Yangtze—have resumed normal operations wherever they were not destroyed by shelling. Those that were destroyed have relocated and reopened. The staff in all bureaus are, for the most part, the same Chinese employees as before. Ordinary and registered mail, as well as parcels, are handled completely normally. The only restrictions imposed by the Japanese concern letter censorship. Postal savings operations at each bureau continue as before wherever possible. Postal services in North and South China still have some areas not yet restored, all in regions where fighting is ongoing. Mail transport still relies mainly on trains and ships; letters undeliverable are due solely to senders’ failure to know recipients’ addresses, not to any deficiency on the postal services’ part.</p>
<h3>Homeless Children Flooding the Streets; Crimes by Youth Are Common; Municipal Council Studying Relief</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated “island,” the city’s underage beggars and wandering children have filled the streets, with many turning to theft and other offenses. Although police authorities have passively arrested and sentenced them, the Municipal Council is now studying ways to bring these homeless children into proper channels. The Children’s Protection Division is also preparing to establish a special school where non‑offending child beggars captured by the police can be sent to receive education. According to the Municipal Council’s report for July, there were 24 juveniles under age twenty found to have violated laws, and 74 who broke the Council’s regulations. Their offenses include aiding in brothels (66 cases), theft (54), vagrancy (42), and pickpocketing (10). Sentences included 82 restitutions, 75 fines, 36 prison terms, 11 deferred sentences, and 8 acquittals; 1 was sent to charitable institutions, and 16 cases remain unresolved.</p>
<h3>Special Open‑Air Concerts in Two Parks</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council orchestra will hold special open‑air concerts from 9 to 11 pm on the 17th at the French Park and from 9 to 11 pm on the 19th at Zhaofeng Park (weather permitting). Famous vocal soloists and dance masters will perform, with a program of nine items identical at both venues. Music lovers are urged not to miss these events.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Shanghai National Goods Factories Plan Establishment of Singapore National Goods Company</h3>
<p>Capitalized at 200,000 Straits dollars; Office Already Secured</p>
<p>Former head of the South Seas Commercial Inspection Delegation, Mr. Gao Shi, at the urging of various Shanghai national goods factories this spring traveled to Singapore to promote domestic products. At the same time, commissioned by the National Goods Joint‑Stock Company, he has been preparing in Singapore to establish the China National Goods Company to introduce a wide range of domestic products for use by the local Chinese community. Since domestic merchants have paid scant attention to national goods in the past, and have not leveraged the vast markets of the South Seas, and since overseas Chinese were previously unaware of major advances in domestic craftsmanship—often suspecting the quality of national goods—the mission of the new company is to introduce and connect Chinese factories with South Seas commerce. With unanimous support from the banking community and overseas Chinese leaders, the Singapore National Goods Company is planned with capital of 200,000 Straits dollars and is seeking suitable premises, with hopes to open shortly. Mr. Gao recently wrote to friends in Shanghai reporting on recent developments, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>South Seas Trade</p>
<p>Commerce throughout the region is almost entirely in Chinese hands, with Chinese shops in both cities and rural areas. In fact, overseas Chinese dominate trade in the South Seas. On the Malay Peninsula alone, total imports in 1937 amounted to 692 million Straits dollars, of which imports from China were only 276 million Straits dollars—just over 3% of the total—representing only a small fraction of the trade handled by business circles dealing in national goods; most businesses trade European and American goods. Given the Chinese commercial advantage, expanding exports of national goods to the South Seas has great potential. If domestic factories improve and adjust their products and we promote them properly in the South Seas, Shanghai factories’ goods can secure a key position in that market.</p>
<p>Favorable Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Current exchange rates offer significant benefits to export trade. They also help obtain foreign currency, exchangeable for hard cash to facilitate raw material purchases. Recently, the exchange rate is 100 French francs to 16 Straits dollars, a ratio of about 6 to 1. In the midst of sluggish domestic markets, overseas development is the only sales outlet. Except for leather goods and stoves, every day‑to‑day item produced by Shanghai factories can be marketed in the South Seas, where overseas Chinese consumption habits are on par with domestic ones, and their enthusiasm for national goods is even greater.</p>
<p>Establishment of Office</p>
<p>To facilitate communication between Shanghai factories and South Seas merchants, Mr. Gao has set up an office at 46A Cross Street, Singapore, Straits Settlements. Any Shanghai factory, large or small, wishing to market products in the South Seas or seeking consultation may write directly to Mr. Gao. He is eager to serve factories to open development channels for national goods. If samples or price lists are sent directly to him, the process will be even faster—an excellent opportunity to address Shanghai factories’ current woes and develop overseas trade.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Spreads Narcotics in China</h3>
<p>League of Nations Opium Committee – United States Representative’s Report</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Fowler, the American representative to the League of Nations’ Opium Advisory Committee, has recently produced an astonishing report exposing the trade and consumption of narcotics within China.  It explains that the Chinese government has adopted powerful measures to eradicate narcotics, whereas in the Japanese‑occupied areas of China the narcotics situation—through both official and private channels—has grown markedly worse.  Fowler’s report, covering the two‑year period ending May 20 of this year, severely condemns the Japanese attitude toward the narcotics problem.</p>
<p>The report provides a city‑by‑city and jurisdiction‑by‑jurisdiction account throughout China, citing examples of increased narcotics consumption and trade among the Chinese population under Japanese control and among the Japanese themselves.  It also presents two court cases from Shanghai—one Chinese, one Japanese—as illustrating the contrasting approaches of Chinese and Japanese authorities to opium trade:</p>
<p>A Japanese woman, found carrying twenty‑five ounces of heroin, was arrested in Shanghai on April 2, 1938.  She confessed that she had purchased the drug in Nagasaki intending to sell it in Shanghai for large profit.  She embarked on the Nagasaki Maru with the narcotics on April 7 and arrived in Shanghai.  On May 6 of the same year, the Japanese administration court charged her with attempting to sell twenty‑five ounces of heroin and imposed a fine of thirty yen.</p>
<p>By contrast, on April 22, 1938, a Chinese man surnamed Tang (phonetic) was arrested in Shanghai for carrying twenty‑five ounces of Japanese‑manufactured heroin.  On May 7, the Shanghai Special Zone Court sentenced him to life imprisonment for possession of heroin with intent to sell.</p>
<p>Fowler’s report further states that the United States is deeply concerned about the current narcotics situation in the Japanese‑occupied areas of China because, first, the U.S. government has obtained evidence showing that since 1935 a large proportion of the heroin seized in illicit transactions within the United States originated from the Japanese concession in Tianjin; and second, that all opium seized in smoking‑ready form in the United States has come from China, labeled as “China” or “Iran” opium—some of it processed in or near Shanghai, the rest from South and North China.  This smoking‑ready opium has no legitimate market in China and is destined solely for illicit trade within the United States.  Recently, large quantities were seized in Honolulu and Manila, indicating a sharp increase in opium smuggled from the Far East into America, accounting for roughly three‑quarters of the total opium seizures in the latter half of 1938.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. government, it is willing to take all necessary steps to improve the dire Far Eastern narcotics situation on the following conditions:</p>
<p>1.  The Japanese government must exercise effective authority over its nationals and the puppet regimes in occupied Chinese territories to prevent:</p>
<p>(a)  importation of opium into those regions;</p>
<p>(b)  transport of opium from one part of those regions to another;</p>
<p>(c)  manufacture, from opium, of other narcotics within those regions;</p>
<p>(d)  sale, within those regions, of narcotics derived from opium;</p>
<p>(e)  export of opium and its derivatives from those regions to third countries.</p>
<p>2.  The Iranian authorities must immediately adopt effective measures to stop illicit exports of opium from Iran to the Far East.  Regrettably, such illicit trade appears to have increased rather than diminished.</p>
<p>3.  The Portuguese government should adopt effective measures, in cooperation with international efforts against illicit narcotics trade, to prevent Macau from being used as a base for such trade.</p>
<p>The report then describes Shanghai’s situation: reliable sources indicate that a renowned narcotics manufacturer from Osaka plans to establish a large drug factory in Shanghai before the end of 1938.  It is estimated that by late 1938 Shanghai’s daily opium consumption will reach about five thousand taels, of which one thousand taels will be Iranian opium.  In February of this year, opium and other narcotics continued to be sold freely in the Shanghai Municipal and French Concessions, as well as in all major cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui under Japanese control.  Observations indicate that neither the Japanese nor their puppet regimes are making any effort to curb this burgeoning illicit trade.</p>
<p>Regarding Hankou, the report states that the puppet regime there has enacted narcotics regulations aimed at (1) generating revenue and (2) facilitating opium and other narcotics consumption by the Chinese.  Under the supervision of the Anti‑Opium Bureau of the Wuhan Maintenance Committee, opium sales began in January this year.  On January 28, the Wuhan Gazette promulgated regulations governing opium sale and use, vesting all licensing of vendors, retailers, and smokers in that bureau, with no apparent limit on vendor licenses.  According to officials, in the “Chinese districts” of Hankou—refugee areas and neighboring quarters—countless opium shops and smoking parlors have opened.  By the end of January there were seventy registered smoking parlors; by the end of March that number had risen to four hundred.</p>
<p>In Tianjin, although local newspapers claimed that all smoking parlors in the Japanese concession were closed on October 1, 1938, small establishments continued selling opium, and larger ones simply relocated outside the concession to areas nominally under Chinese management.  Conservative estimates put their number at five hundred.  All manner of addictive narcotics could be obtained almost instantly at many locations within the concession.  On December 12, 1938, the Chinese‑language newspaper under Japanese control reported that Tianjin’s Taxation Bureau had received orders permitting fifteen additional smoking parlors.  In the districts nominally managed by Chinese, licensed smoking parlors thus totaled one hundred eighty‑nine.</p>
<p>In Peking, reliable sources estimate that about three hundred licensed opium‑smoking establishments operated in October 1938; heroin was also sold openly at numerous locations with no attempt at suppression.  By March this year, these establishments had grown to over four hundred.</p>
<p>In Jinan, after the Japanese occupation, the Jinan branch of the Taxation Bureau allowed opium to be sold publicly upon payment of taxes.  By the end of September 1938, four shops were licensed to sell raw opium and forty to sell prepared opium paste.  By the end of November, the number selling prepared paste had risen to one hundred thirty‑six.  Between December 1, 1938, and March 20 of this year, Jinan’s opium trade statistics were as follows:</p>
<p>During that period the value of imported opium reached approximately 2,905,993 yuan.  These taxation figures do not represent total revenue from public opium sales; other sources include (1) monthly license fees of 100–200 yuan from raw‑opium shops, (2) fifty‑yuan monthly license fees paid six months in advance by prepared‑opium shops, (3) a two‑jiao policing tax per tael on imported raw opium, (4) a one‑quarter‑yuan per month policing tax on license fees, (5) a three‑yuan per month policing tax per smoking lamp, (6) a fifty‑cent per month policing tax on licensed opium smokers, (7) a five‑cent per tael transfer tax to the Taxation Bureau, and (8) heavy fines for regulatory violations.  In November 1938 raw opium sold for eight to ten yuan per tael; by March this year the price had climbed to ten to thirteen yuan.</p>
<p>The report concludes with Nanjing: according to a letter dated November 22, 1938, from Professor Pei Ci, in 1938 Nanjing’s monthly public opium sales reached two million yuan, while heroin sales in the surrounding region reached three million yuan per month.  Private estimates suggest that of Nanjing’s 400,000 residents, at least 50,000 were addicted to heroin, including many young men and women.  Much of the opium is said to have come via Dalian through Shanghai.  The Japanese “Anti‑Opium Bureau” manages Nanjing’s public opium sales system, its regulations designed to tax all private trade and consumption.</p>

<h3>Western District Anhe Temple Road: Thugs Shoot Two Chinese Constables; Patrol Officers Suddenly Ambushed; One Constable Seriously Wounded in the Abdomen</h3>
<p>Chinese Constables No. 2404 and No. 275 from the Jing’an Temple Police Station were on routine border patrol at around 7:30 p.m. yesterday when they passed the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Kaixuan Road in the Western District.  Observing forty or fifty suspicious men loitering nearby, the officers approached to question them and intended to conduct a search.  Unbeknownst to them, the men had been lying in wait.  As soon as the constables drew near, the assailants opened fire to resist arrest.  The two officers returned fire, but outnumbered and without cover, No. 2404 was shot in the abdomen and No. 275 in the leg.  The attackers then fled.  Nearby officers rushed to the station to report the incident and conveyed the wounded men to hospital.  No. 2404 remains in critical condition.  The police are conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Fake Police and Armed Thugs Engage in Melee</h3>
<p>Early yesterday morning in western Shanghai, a clash broke out between members of the so‑called “Avenue Police” and several plainclothes men.  At approximately 1:15 a.m., the “Avenue Police,” having received a report that armed men were hiding at the Sanhe Hotel on Yidingpan Road in Anbang, proceeded to search the premises.  Those inside, alerted to the impending raid, opened fire on the pseudo‑officers.  Over a hundred shots were exchanged; stray bullets flew in all directions, awakening frightened residents.  Although one apartment occupant was injured, no bystanders were struck.  It remains unclear whether there were casualties among the two warring groups.</p>
<h3>Infatuation with a New Flame Leads Husband to Abandon First Wife, Falsely Accuse Her of Adultery; Wife Acquitted, Now Seeks Divorce</h3>
<p>Fang Changsheng, fifty, a Shaoxing native operating a wine shop in the South District, married a woman surnamed Chuan (forty‑seven, also from Shaoxing) over twenty years ago.  Their early marriage was harmonious, but Fang, alleging infertility, took a new mistress and subjected Chuan to repeated abuse.  On December 19 last year, Chuan, unable to endure the mistreatment, stayed temporarily at her cousin Mao Gensheng’s wine shop.  Fang reported her to the French Concession police on a false charge of adultery with Mao.  After an investigation found no evidence of infidelity, she was declared not guilty.  Having suffered abuse and wrongful accusation, Chuan filed for divorce in the Second Special Tribunal’s Civil Court through lawyer Yun Tao.  Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiaoke heard initial arguments in the Seventh Court.  Fang and his attorney opposed the divorce, while Chuan insisted.  The court adjourned to review the case files before the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Banditry in the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>At around 11:30 p.m. the night before last, over thirty armed bandits attacked Sun Genglalang village in the Southern Direct Zone of Hongqiao Town, Western District, Japanese‑occupied area.  They surrounded the village from all sides, then entered and looted over twenty households—including those of Sun Sigen, Sun Wenzuo, Sun Quansheng, and Sun A Qiu.  After about two hours, having loaded their loot, they moved on to the nearby Panjiashi Bridge area (half a li from Sun Genglalang) and ransacked the homes of carpenter Pan Lanfang and farmer Pan Sigen Zhu Xingsheng, stripping them of all clothing and belongings.  It was not until 3:30 a.m. that they departed toward the Caohe’embankment, loaded with plunder.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Wife and Concubine: Husband Aids Concubine in Attack, Injuring First Wife; Husband Flees; Concubine Chen Wang Case Heard, Sentence Pending</h3>
<p>Chen Runfu, thirty‑seven, a native of Yangzhou and former employee of a slaughterhouse on Calais Road in the French Concession, lived near his workplace with his wife Cheng and their two sons, all dependent on his income.  Three years ago he took as a concubine Wang—a Changshu woman living at No. 587, Lane 8, Matheson Road—by whom he had two more children.  With his wife’s consent, Chen moved in with Wang in mid‑July to reduce expenses.  On the morning of the 27th, his eleven‑year‑old son Jin Hua insulted Wang by calling her a “little mistress,” touching off a fierce quarrel between mother and child that soon turned into mutual blows.  Chen sided with his concubine, forced Cheng onto the bed, and handed a kitchen knife to Wang to silence her.  Unexpectedly, Cheng was struck in the neck, suffering a severe, life‑threatening wound.  Alarmed by the grave situation, Chen fled.  The Gordon Road police station, notified of the incident, dispatched Detective Liu Zhenggang to rush Cheng to Guangren Hospital.  Chen and Wang were arrested and taken to the First Special District Court.  Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi resumed the hearing in the Third Criminal Court.  Prosecutor Li Zhishan requested an adjournment; Chen remains at large.  Cheng, whose condition has somewhat improved, testified that Wang, incensed by the insult, beat her and her son and then stabbed her in the neck with intent to kill, demanding 100 yuan for medical and convalescence expenses.  Jin Hua contradicted this, claiming his father and uncles forced Wang to attack and that his mother, in anger, picked up the knife herself.  Judge Jiang found the facts sufficiently clear and, after initial arguments by counsel, set the verdict for next Monday morning.  Wang remains in custody.</p>
<h3>Workers’ Armed Brawl at the Junction of Jiaozhou Road and Areca‑nut Road: Five Injured</h3>
<p>At around 6:40 a.m. yesterday outside No. 150 Jiaozhou Road near the American United Industries office, Pang Guangyu, a Hui Muslim from Shandong employed there, quarreled with Zhao Changsheng, a Taizhou man working at a neighboring woolen mill.  The dispute escalated into violence as each side summoned reinforcements—over forty men armed with knives, axes, and clubs—resulting in a full‑scale melee.  The Putuo Road police station dispatched a large force of Chinese and Western detectives, but the combatants had already dispersed upon hearing of the police intervention.  Only one man, Tang Jusheng (a Taizhou native), was apprehended.  Five wounded individuals—Pang Jincai (25, head and back injuries), Hou Zigao (23, right thigh), Gao Maosheng (23, head and left shoulder), Pang Qingyu (28, head and right hand wounds), and Chen Yulao (26, head and left leg)—were taken by cart to the Laogong Hospital on Xia Shadu Road for treatment.</p>
<h3>Xu Bingnan: Ship Lost After the War Newly Discovered; Shipowner Arrested After Being Reported to the Police</h3>
<p>Xu Bingnan, thirty, from Wuxi, residing at No. 4 Pingjiang Hotel on Sanma Road, recently reported to the French Concession police station that on August 8, 1935, he had chartered a sixty‑ton cargo vessel named Xi Zhang under the Luheji Company.  After the August 13 conflict, he fled in panic and neglected the ship; upon his return it had disappeared and could not be found.  Unexpectedly, on August 11 this year, he learned the vessel had been discovered on the banks of the Youdai Corner River and identified its possessor as Wang Hongyou, thirty‑nine, of Funing.  Wang allegedly purchased it in 1938 for 750 yuan.  Doubting the claim’s veracity, Xu requested Wang’s arrest and interrogation.  Police detectives apprehended Wang and brought him to the station.  Yesterday he was escorted to the Second Special Court, Eighth Criminal Division, where Judge Zhu Chuzhe heard the case.  The prosecution requested an adjournment, noting the investigation was incomplete.  Wang stated he had indeed bought the vessel in 1938 and held a contract as proof, which was then in his home county; he requested bail to retrieve it for verification.  The court adjourned to the 23rd and remanded Wang.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Between Two Women Drags in Baby: One Splashes Cold Water, Infant Catches Cold and Dies</h3>
<p>Lu Shunfa, fifty‑two, a native of Ningbo who works as a steward on the Shanghai‑Ningbo ferry “Mufu,” lives with his wife Li and their four‑month‑old daughter Huaiqin in the French Concession at No. 9 Zhicheng Lane, Ailiage Road.  Their niece Liu Zheng, twenty‑eight, also resides in the parlor.  On the night of the 13th at about 9 p.m., while holding Huaiqin, Li and Liu quarreled over bedding.  In the tumult, Liu accidentally overturned a basin of cold water onto the baby.  Despite neighbors’ efforts, the infant developed chills and fever by midnight and died at 6 p.m. on the 15th due to lack of treatment.  Li, blaming her niece for the child’s illness and death, reported the matter to the French Concession police.  Investigator Jiang Zhongjia carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan morgue.  Yesterday the prosecutor of the Second Special Court and a forensic physician examined the remains and concluded the girl died of illness, with no other cause.  After questioning the father and Li, and reviewing the investigation, the court, noting the family’s inability to pay for burial, ordered the body turned over to public burial authorities.</p>
<h3>Attack on Newspaper Office Case: Three More Released</h3>
<p>In the case of the attack on the China–America–Japan Evening News office, seven suspects, including Shen Yufei, were detained.  Police investigation determined that three individuals, including Wu Yiwei, were uninvolved and released.  Further inquiry cleared another man, Tan Zhiyi, who this morning was released by order of Judge Xu Fen in the First Special Court upon petition by police lawyer Wang Yaotang.  The remaining three suspects—including Shen Yufei—will face trial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Crushed Under Wheels: Driver Found Not at Fault</h3>
<p>Song Jinbo, a native of Suzhou and father‑in‑law of the celebrated opera performer Tang Xiaofei, was struck and killed by bus No. 15067 of the British‑owned Public Bus Company, driven by Yang Fuyun, in front of the Hua’an Insurance Company on Jing’an Temple Road.  The victim was taken to Baolong Hospital, where he died.  His son, Song Xintian, engaged a lawyer to bring a private prosecution against Yang for negligent manslaughter at the First Special Court.  After the initial trial, Yang was acquitted.  Song appealed to the Second High Court.  Yesterday, Chief Judge Yu presided over the appeal.  Yang, defended by attorneys Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong, argued that in his ten years of service he had no prior incidents; on the day in question the victim suddenly crossed the street and collided with the bus’s fender, causing fatal injuries.  Police at the scene found no negligence and declined to press charges.  The company also paid 150 yuan in compensation.  The private prosecution six months later was improper, they argued, and the appeal should be dismissed.  The appeals court rejected the appeal.</p>
<h3>Asiatic Cholera Continues to Appear in the City</h3>
<p>At the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital at the junction of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, on the 11th of this month a patient named Zhao Chen, thirty‑five, a Hunan native living in a makeshift hut near Zhaofeng Garden, was treated in critical condition.  A stool sample sent to the Municipal Health Department confirmed genuine cholera.  Following treatment, his condition has improved.  A previous cholera patient, Zhang Binghai, survived after receiving four saline infusions totaling twenty‑three pints (about twenty jin).  A follow‑up test by the Health Department confirmed the bacteria have entirely disappeared, and Zhang is expected to be discharged soon.  To prevent further spread, the Health Department has dispatched staff to disinfect patients’ homes and has vaccinated their families and cohabitants—a measure of considerable public benefit.</p>
<h3>Life on the Isolated Island Grows More Difficult; Ready‑Boiled Water Service Also Raises Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, due to tightened foreign exchange, prices in many trades have risen sharply, making life increasingly difficult for ordinary people.  Yesterday, the city’s ready‑boiled water vendors (commonly called “Tiger Stoves”) announced a fifty‑percent price increase—up from two wen for ten ladlefuls to ten wen per ladle—and warned that undercutting would incur a thirty‑yuan fine.  Bathhouse operators likewise announced price hikes of one to five fen, averaging increases of one‑sixth to one‑quarter.</p>
<h3>Li Yongkuan and His Sons Sentenced to Heavy Prison Terms; All Appeal</h3>
<p>Anhui native and notorious bandit leader Li Yongkuan, together with his sons Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua, took advantage of the Nationalist Army’s westward retreat two winters ago to lead gangs in looting, arson, murder, and forced marriages throughout the villages and towns of Songjiang.  After their arrests last winter by the French Concession police at Xujiahui, they were brought before the Second Special Court’s criminal division on charges of robbery, murder, and violation of public morals.  Following dozens of hearings under Presiding Judge Liao, the trial concluded recently.  This morning in the First Criminal Court, the verdict was delivered:</p>
<p>Li Yongkuan was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment for continuous robbery and deprived of civil rights for ten years.  Li Jiazhou received fifteen years for murder, eight years for continuous robbery, and five years for continuous rapes, to be served concurrently for a total of eighteen years, and was deprived of civil rights for fifteen years.  Li Bihua was sentenced to eight years for continuous robbery and five years for continuous rapes, to be served concurrently for ten years, and deprived of civil rights for eight years.</p>
<p>All defendants protested the verdicts, claiming that during the previous winter in Songjiang they had served as local peacekeepers under Commander Pan Yingchang and had not committed robbery.  As for the two girls, Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian, they alleged that village elders arranged their marriages to Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua without coercion.  The girls’ mother was reportedly killed by stray bullets while fighting Japanese forces, not by Li Jiazhou.  They also claimed that the accusations were instigated by others.  The defendants have appealed to the Third High Court.</p>
<h3>Roguery to the End of Conscience: Forcing a Young Girl into Prostitution—Two Rogues Apprehended, Case Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Young girl Zeng Cuihong, twelve years old, nickname Maomao, whose parents remained in their native village. Because of their family’s poverty, they entrusted someone to bring her to Shanghai and recommended her for work in a cotton mill. There were two idler ruffians from north of the river, Wang Lindi and Li A’er, who habitually lured ignorant women in the mill district and committed rape for profit—it had become their regular trade. Unluckily, they happened upon Cuihong. Seeing her young and lively—though only twelve, her physical development was fully mature, like that of an adult, and she had a certain charm—they deceived her with promises of gain and took her to Room 3 of the Huishan Hotel on Bailao Hui Road in Hongkou, where they forced her to spend the night with men she did not know. Since the beginning of last month, the total number of clients she served—both new faces and familiar ones—numbered no fewer than twenty. Day after day she was violated; how could the little girl endure such repeated torment? Helpless and naive, though she suffered grievously, she was so terrified by Wang and the others that she dared not report them or seek help. Only the day before yesterday, taking advantage of their unguarded moment, she escaped. Intending to seek refuge with a relative in west Shanghai but unfamiliar with the routes, she wandered near the Xiaosha Ferry Road, where she was suddenly spotted by French Concession patrolman No. 3305, Hua police. Finding her appearance suspicious, he brought her into the Xinzha police station. After questioning her about the circumstances, they notified the Huishan station, which dispatched detectives to her address and arrested Wang Lindi and Li A’er. Yesterday morning they were delivered to the First Special District Court and publicly indicted on charges of rape. The inquiry was conducted by Procurator Jiang Shuzi. Because the case involved indecency, attendance was prohibited. Further investigation was reported as necessary, and the hearing was postponed for additional questioning.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Public Works Commendation: Distinguished Detective Work by Deputy Detective Superintendent Clitden and Chinese Officer No. 2512</h3>
<p>On April 19 at about 7:45 p.m. on Yuyuan Road, a case occurred in which bandits fired shots to resist arrest. Three bandits, two of them armed with pistols, intended to rob a passerby—which happened to be Deputy Detective Superintendent Clitden of the Police Department. He immediately drew his weapon and advanced. The bandits opened fire first; Clitden returned fire, and they fled into an alley leading into the Chinese quarter. On May 25 the Police Department captured one of the thieves. After interrogation, he was confirmed to be the same bandit who had struggled with Clitden on Yuyuan Road and had shot Clitden in the leg at that time. Then, on June 28 at about noon, Chinese officer No. 2512 was on post at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road when a passerby reported that three armed bandits had robbed him and were fleeing east along Yuyuan Road. Officer 2512 immediately drove after them and, with great courage, captured two of the bandits. The Police Commendation Committee judged each officer’s bravery and alertness as highly commendable. With approval from the Ministry of Public Works Board of Directors, each was awarded a Second Class Special Merit Medal as a public encouragement.</p>
<h3>Over Sixty and Involved in Litigation: White‑Haired Man and Woman in Dispute; Elderly Woman Seeks Alimony</h3>
<p>Mr. Ye Qixiang, an elderly white‑haired man residing at No. 28 Henry Road, was recently sued by Mrs. Ye Zhang, a sixty‑one‑year‑old widow living at No. 47‑6, Juqing Li, Xinzha Road. Through her attorney Ye Shaoying, she petitioned the Civil Mediation Court of the Second Special Tribunal, requesting that Mr. Ye be summoned to appear for mediation and be ordered to pay living expenses of 15,000 yuan in national currency. She argued that twenty‑eight years ago she and Mr. Ye Qixiang, out of love, cohabited at Yide Li on Xiamen Road and later at No. 81 Guling Road, and that for more than twenty years their relationship had been harmonious. After the outbreak of the Shanghai conflict, the respondent, under the pretext of seeking refuge, treated the petitioner as though she were an old discarded autumn fan; with regard to the petitioner…</p>
<h3>Bandits Kill Victim with Gunfire: Xu Baosheng Sentenced to Death; Other Defendants Receive Varied Punishments</h3>
<p>At the Chengdu Road police station, Chinese Detective Chief Shao Jingfan and Detective Chen Yaoting arrested on the eighteenth of last month five bandits: former gang member Zhu Zhangqing; local man Zhu Juxiang (alias Chenxi); Peidong native Cai Futing; Ding Chuanlin; and Xu Baosheng (alias Zhu Zhongyun). They seized two pistols and eleven rounds of ammunition. Investigation found that these men had, on March 2 of this year, robbed Mr. Shen Qilin at No. 576, Lane 391, Haifang Road of property worth 100 yuan; on April 11 they robbed Mr. Yang Taxia at No. 728 Kangnao Lane of property worth 30 yuan; and on May 23 at 9:55 p.m., in an attempted robbery at No. 7687 Xiaosha Ferry Road, they fired their weapons and fatally shot the victim Mr. Wang Jintang. The case was transferred to the First Special Tribunal for interrogation and finalization. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Xiao Xiefen convened the Second Criminal Division to announce the verdict. The judgment is as follows: Zhu Zhangqing, for conspiring with three or more persons, carrying weapons, and committing nighttime residential robbery, is sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment; Zhu Juxiang receives six years; Cai Futing and Ding Chuanlin, for jointly intending to procure military‑use timber as implements of crime, each receive one year; and Xu Baosheng, for continuous robbery and intentional homicide, is sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life, with two pistols and ten rounds of ammunition confiscated and temporarily held at the station.</p>
<h3>Apartment Manager Assault Case: Appeal Reduces Fines</h3>
<p>At No. 431 Pubo Road, manager Xin Lichong of the Mainland Apartments and accountant Xin Runquan, on the night of March 24 this year, quarreled over a room fee with Mr. Hu Shaochuan, clerk of the Wu County Court, and his wife Ms. Hu Qian. They ordered the teahouse staff to seize and beat the Hu couple, causing injuries. Hu’s two‑year‑old daughter, frightened when her mother Ms. Hu Qian was dragged and thrown to the ground, succumbed to her shock and died. After the assault, the Xins turned themselves in to the police station, claiming the Hus had tried to evade the room fee; with no evidence, the case was dismissed. The Hus then requested a forensic examination from the Second Special Court and privately sued Xin Lichong and Xin Runquan for instigating assault, attaching a civil claim for medical expenses and damages. In the first instance, the court fined Xin Lichong 600 yuan and Xin Runquan 200 yuan, and transferred the civil suit to the civil chamber for trial. Dissatisfied, the Xins appealed to the Third Branch Court. Taking the circumstances into account, presiding Judge Wu Tingqi of the Third Branch, together with Assistant Judges Chen and Wang, held a hearing yesterday morning and reduced each appellant’s fine by 100 yuan; all other claims of the appeal were dismissed.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments at the National Normal College</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education, in view of the shortage of qualified teachers in secondary schools and its negative impact on overall education, has established the National Normal College to improve the foundation of education at all levels nationwide. The wartime status of the College is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>Preparations for the National Normal College began last July, when the Ministry appointed Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Mr. Zhu Jingnong, Mr. Zhu Deyao, Mr. Wu Junsheng, and Mr. Liao Shicheng to the Preparatory Committee, naming Liao Shicheng as Director of Preparations. After Pan Gongzhan accepted a post on the Hunan Provincial Government, Mr. Yuan Zhe was appointed to replace him as committee director. Director Liao, bearing full responsibility, immediately set to work—visiting sites throughout Hunan to select a campus, overseeing building construction, and traveling to Shanghai and Chongqing to recruit faculty and preside over national higher normal education conferences, where plans for the College’s future were discussed. Mr. Wang Deyao and Mr. Yuan Zhe assisted with all preparatory matters and made great contributions. By late October, the College was formally established.</p>
<p>Location and Facilities</p>
<p>The Ministry originally decided to site the College in Hunan’s western region at Shupu, but due to inconvenient transport and frequent banditry, the site was moved to Lantian in central Anhua County. Lantian, adjacent to Xiangxiang and close to the birthplace of the Qing‑era luminary Zeng Guofan, lies on the Hunan‑Guizhou Road, offering relatively convenient transport. It is also a cassiterite export region, with electricity, telephone service, and daily necessities roughly available. About one mile north of the town, amid rolling hills, stands a large estate called “Li Yuan,” with over a hundred tile‑roofed rooms encircled by green pines and bamboo. A clear stream winds through its front, creating a tranquil scholarly setting free from worldly bustle—an ideal place for study and teaching. The Preparatory Committee decided to lease it as the campus and added nine classrooms behind the main buildings. Thus, lecture halls, dormitories, a library, and laboratories were all in place. Classes began November 1, and on the fifth instruction commenced; faculty and students settled in comfortably. Recently, to meet next year’s needs, plans have been drawn up to build new facilities for incoming students and the attached secondary school. Although setup was rushed and impeded by war and transport difficulties, recruiting professors was still challenging. Nevertheless, those appointed to teach are accomplished scholars; current faculty include sixteen professors and lecturers, five teaching assistants, and over ten additional staff. Besides committee member Wang Deyao serving as Academic Director and Yuan Zhe as Head of Civic Education, the College also appointed renowned educator Ren Cheng as Chief Tutor and national history master Qian Jibo as Chair of Chinese Literature. The Dean, Liao Shicheng, also serves as Chair of Education. Other professorships were filled largely from Shanghai and Chongqing, many by longtime university lecturers of high reputation. Students were recruited through a central Ministry examination and assignment, with initial enrollment quotas set at 179. Because of wartime transport difficulties, not all could arrive. To date, 105 students have matriculated—93 male and 12 female. By provincial allocation: Hunan 54, Jiangsu 13, Hubei 9, Jiangxi 7, Guangdong 4, Anhui 4, Guangxi 3, Zhejiang 3, Henan 3, Guizhou 2, Fujian 1, Sichuan 1. Hunan accounts for the largest share; Jiangsu is second, with 12% of the total; the remainder are minorities.</p>
<p>Library and Equipment</p>
<p>During the war, schools universally felt the lack of books and apparatus, but the newly founded College has been particularly fortunate. In equipment, it received over 200 crates from Anhui University, encompassing instruments and reagents for mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and medical use—practically everything needed. On campus there are fully equipped chemistry and biology laboratories, facilitating student experiments. For books, the Ministry initially ordered transfer of volumes from the Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Library for use at the College, but since those volumes were needed for Jiangsu secondary schools at Qiancheng and transport was impossible, there was fear of a book shortage. Soon this was resolved by arranging with Hunan Private Nanxuan Library to provide 16,700 volumes. Combined with purchases from Changsha, Jinhua, Xiangtan, and elsewhere, the College now holds over 20,000 Chinese and Western books. Important Chinese classics include the Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Works, the Siku Quanshu primary and supplementary editions, the Twenty‑Four Histories, rare Song‑era Siku editions, the Congshu Jicheng, Wan You Wenku, Wanwei Bie Cang anthologies, various county gazetteers of Hunan, and many collections of essays by famed figures. Among Western books, the Encyclopedia Britannica is especially prized. A broad selection of contemporary Chinese and Western publications is also maintained, along with over a hundred periodicals and twenty‑three newspapers, satisfying faculty and student needs.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Actively Promotes Wartime Curriculum</h3>
<p>(The Taixian Report) To advance wartime patriotic education, the Jiangsu Education Department has repeatedly instructed all secondary and primary schools in the province to accelerate implementation of wartime curricula. For secondary schools, they have distributed the Ministry’s National Secondary School Curriculum Outline, the Special Wartime Secondary Education Guidelines, and other wartime secondary education regulations for reference and implementation. For primary schools, they have likewise issued the Ministry’s Special Wartime Primary Education Guidelines and other wartime elementary regulations, urging all schools to study and apply them. Additionally, the Department has promulgated five methods for training primary students during the war, and various county‑level wartime special education implementation measures, all for schools to consider and adopt.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Education Department Adjusts Provincial Secondary School Salaries, Effective Year 28</h3>
<p>(Kunming Report) To adjust the remuneration of principals in provincial secondary schools to suit current conditions, the Yunnan Education Department, based on the newly issued budgetary guidelines for monthly school funding and on the Rules for Principal Appointment and Remuneration, has separately compiled and promulgated a monthly salary schedule for principals of provincial secondary schools, to be adhered to. Compensation for principals serving concurrently in multiple roles is also specified in detail. All provisions take effect from Year 28. The salary schedules have already been distributed to each school for compliance. In addition, salaries and wages for full‑time teachers, administrative staff, and service personnel in provincial secondary schools have also been adjusted by the Department.</p>
<h3>American Democracy Education Conference Opens</h3>
<p>(Havana, July 15, via New York wire) The Democracy in Political Education Conference recently opened here. A dispatch from President Roosevelt (currently traveling over Canadian waters) was read, stating, “If the foundation of democratic politics is not enriched through educational methods, it cannot be firmly established.” Columbia University President Butler then delivered a welcome address to the delegates, followed by a speech from former Polish Ambassador to the U.S. Cichonowski, who remarked that there is a fable claiming that all dictatorships are now too powerful to defeat; the primary task of democratic politics is to prove that fable false. Other representatives also spoke in turn, unanimously condemning the dictatorships.</p>
<h3>Shanghai East Commune Plans to Establish Two More Apprentice Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai East Commune of Hujiang University has long been noted for its promotion of social education. In view of the scant academic training apprentices receive from merchants, this spring the Commune organized four regional apprentice schools—on Nanjing Road at the Mainland Commercial Arcade of Hujiang University, at Guangdong Road City Middle School, on Xinzha Road at the Methodist Chinese School, and at Lao Weiqiao Zhenru Primary School—admitting impoverished apprentices and providing them with education to promote commercial ethics and improve service efficiency. All schools are now in session during the summer break, but several sites will soon change addresses with the new term. The Commune also plans to open two additional schools to further expand apprentice education; they are currently busy planning and seeking locations.</p>

<h3>Finance: Cash Market Again Sees Astonishing Surge; Peak Reaches 4,580 Yuan; Sudden Decline in Evening on Unfavorable News</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Japanese market cash spot price on the black market soared dramatically, then intensified further, consecutively breaking through key thresholds of 4,400 and 4,500 yuan per 10‑tael bar, and at one point neared the 4,600 yuan mark. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant. The surge can be attributed to four factors:</p>
<p>1. Repeated rumors that the Exchange Stabilization Committee would restore the gold purchase price to 4 .75 taels per ounce, unconfirmed yet prompting banks like HSBC to aggressively absorb gold at 3 .75 taels 6.25, raising hopes—but that news may prove unfounded.</p>
<p>2. Reports that Japanese telegrams indicated Sino‑British negotiations in Hong Kong on a new currency plan, with Japan planning to obstruct it.</p>
<p>3. A proposed peaceful resolution to the Danzig question, temporarily easing European tensions.</p>
<p>4. Slight softening of the foreign exchange selling rate over the past two days to around 5,100 yuan, still 600–700 yuan below market; HSBC’s posted price was nearly 1,000 yuan below. Disappointed sellers rushed to buy, fueling further demand.</p>
<p>Consequently, on the morning open the price leapt to 4,490 yuan, then retreated to 4,480 yuan at the day’s low. Buying pressure soon flared again, pushing sterling into the “3½ yar” area. Hong Kong firms also entered aggressively, driving the high to 4,580 yuan. Profit‑taking by money‑exchange businesses on behalf of clients caused a midday dip back to around 4,500 yuan, but prices rebounded soon after, closing the afternoon session at 4,550 yuan—an increase of 202 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the close, reports of a major Japanese land, sea, and air assault on Shenzhen intended to threaten Hong Kong spread, weakening sentiment. The market moved into a supply‑exceeds‑demand state, and by 6:30 p.m. prices fell back to 4,480 yuan with no buyers in sight. Overall, the outlook remains highly uncertain; those without deep expertise should refrain from following blindly. Trading volume was relatively thin: morning and afternoon combined saw about 1,200 taels of ornamental gold traded, which rose 20 yuan to as high as 410 .10 yuan; customs and standard gold likewise retreated uniformly.</p>
<p>Cash Spot Price Surges by 200 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning per bar (10 taels), the market opened buoyed by favorable rumors and a slight softening of foreign exchange tension, resulting in a firm sentiment and an opening jump of 142 yuan. A money‑exchange house bought 20 taels from one gold dealer at 4,490 yuan; shortly after, a securities firm sold 10 taels to a money‑exchange house at 4,480 yuan. The money‑exchange house remained keen to buy, and retail investors also joined, pushing the price up another 60 yuan when jewelers sold 30 taels to a cash house at 4,540 yuan. A slight correction of 5 yuan followed when the money‑exchange business sold 20 taels to securities firms at 4,535 yuan. Securities firms continued buying, and another gold house also purchased, reigniting the rally by 35 yuan when a securities firm bought 20 taels at 4,570 yuan. Buyers then paused and prices eased by 30 yuan when jewelers sold 10 taels at 4,540 yuan. Hearing further softening in foreign exchange and renewed buying by money‑exchange firms, the price jumped another 40 yuan when one such firm bought 10 taels at 4,580 yuan. At that point, Hong Kong firms were still active buyers, but money‑exchange houses reversed to selling, and a jeweler off‑loaded stock, causing a swift reversal of about 50 yuan when a money‑exchange house sold 10 taels at 4,530 yuan. Shortly thereafter a jeweler bought 20 taels back at 4,550 yuan. As foreign exchange stabilized and buyers thinned, securities and jewelry firms off‑loaded further, weakening the market. A 45 yuan drop to 4,505 yuan ensued when a securities house sold 10 taels to jewelers. Nearing midday, one money‑exchange house aggressively bought on behalf of clients, pushing the price up 40 yuan to 4,545 yuan for 20 taels. That was the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the market opened 5 yuan higher at 4,550 yuan for 20 taels, but subsequent heavy selling by gold houses and securities firms drove it down 15 yuan to 4,525 yuan for 30 taels. Buying then resumed, step by step pushing the price up to the evening close of 4,550 yuan for 30 taels—up 202 yuan on the day, with intra‑day swings of 100 yuan. The selling price of the house bar remained 10 yuan above the spot price. The standard mark gold price remained 65 yuan below the foreign exchange office rate; both showed little activity at the open.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Up 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Jewelers’ price for ornamental gold per tael opened at 440 yuan but jumped 15 yuan at 9:40 a.m. and another 5 yuan at 10 :05 a.m., then stabilized, closing up 20 yuan: major jeweler rate 460 yuan; smaller jeweler rate 458 yuan. Purchasing dropped by 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Purity Gold Down Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 15th: U.S. gold floated down half a penny per ounce, falling 7 pounds 8 shillings 7 pence, causing the Central Bank’s Chinese cash buying price to drop to 1,213 yuan. The customs’ mark gold also fell by three cents to 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen 6 li; the Shanghai standard gold mark fell by 3 jiao to 1,208 yuan 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Buying Also Strengthens; September Forwards Widen; Carry Around 0.10 Yuan</h3>
<p>In yesterday’s foreign exchange market, HSBC’s quoted rates were unchanged. In the black market for sterling and U.S. dollars, rumors of a forthcoming Sino‑British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee decision to curb black‑market rates remained unverified. Tokyo telegrams reporting Sino‑British agreement on a new currency plan—if implemented—would hit speculators but benefit the franc; Japan was reported to be blocking it. An unexpectedly optimistic European situation also reignited buying appetite among traders. Major trading houses and Chinese merchants aggressively bought, and Western firm Johnson also purchased spot pounds. Despite some supply from an American bank, the market softened slightly. At 10:20 a.m., sterling fell to 3 .46875, and the dollar to 6 .75 yuan; later some support arrived and the market closed at sterling 3 .5 and U.S. dollar 6 .8125. Month‑end forwards remained tight; September forwards, with few sellers, widened further. One firm quoted Chinese merchants U.S. dollar 562.5 at monthly interest (excluding commission) of 0.93 jiao; for large amounts, the bank would sell U.S. dollar 625 at 1.03 jiao per month. Half‑day trading was still active.</p>
<p>At open, London large bills and near‑ and far‑date forwards were at plus 1.25; New York silver at plus 1.25; London gold down half a penny; sterling vs. dollar and franc flat; sterling vs. Shanghai up 0.0625; dollar vs. Shanghai up 0.10. HSBC’s posted rates were unchanged. Banks opened spot selling at sterling 3 .5625 and U.S. dollar 6 .9375. Despite heavy buying by Chinese merchants and importers, an American bank’s willingness to sell limited weakness to a slight extent. Chinese merchants and Western firm Johnson bought the bank’s spot sterling at 3 .53125, and spot U.S. dollar at 6 .9375 and 6 .875. When HSBC’s rates were posted, there was no change; the silver balancing tax remained exempt. Chinese merchants then bought September U.S. dollar at 6 .75, followed by Johnson buying the bank’s spot sterling at 3 .53125, and Chinese merchants buying September dollar at 6 .6875, and spot sterling from HSBC at 3 .5. By late morning, bank negotiation rates were sterling 3 .46875 and U.S. dollar 6 .75, with spot closing at sterling 3 .5, U.S. dollar 6 .8125; current‑month sterling 3 .4375, U.S. dollar 6 .6875; September sterling 3 .09375, U.S. dollar 6 .00—sterling and dollar tighter by 0.0625 vs. previous day; September sterling tightened by 0.09375, dollar stronger by 0.1875. No trading Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3>British and U.S. Pound Notes Rally Sharply</h3>
<p>With foreign exchange softening and cash markets surging, British and U.S. pound notes strengthened markedly; demand for both was vigorous. Foreign exchange remained stable, but evening reports of Japanese military incursions on the Hong Kong border created tension, tempering the rise. Hong Kong franc and other notes also saw firm demand; Canadian and Philippine notes followed U.S. dollar moves higher; Australian pound notes were tight and firm; Japanese yen saw keen demand, ending at 1 .16; Korean notes, in short supply, were also firm at 0 .95. Guild exchange remained untraded. Yesterday’s price changes: Australian pound note up 2 yuan; Canadian up 0 .5; Philippine up 0 .2; Hong Kong note up 0 .05; franc up 0 .005; Korean up 0 .005.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Rise; Call‐Loan Rates Dip Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank draft financing rose from an opening of around 170 yuan per 1,000 yuan to a low of 162 yuan, then recovered to 167.5 yuan by late morning. In the afternoon it surged to 186 yuan, settling at 180 yuan—up 12.5 yuan from the previous day. Call‑loan rates in the Money‑Exchange Association market suddenly fell by 0.02 to open both morning and noon markets at 0.18 (per day).</p>
<h3>American Silver Again Extended</h3>
<p>London, 15th: In India and among speculators, silver buying prevailed amidst limited supply, leading to stability and post‑close strength. According to posted rates, large‑lot near‑ and far‑date forwards rose by 2.15; New York silver forwards and spot were both up 1.25. Mumbai silver forwards and spot rose 0.09 anna in both spot and August, and September forwards rose 0.08 anna. Volume was limited to fifty contracts.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Prices Rise Again; Non‑local Indica Continues Flowing into Shanghai</h3>
<p>Domestic Rice: After yesterday’s brief decline, the absence of lower‑Yangtze supplies—and with only 1,200–1,300 packages of Songjiang and Fengjing rice arriving—along with the previous fall triggering restocking by local shops, led to a rally at the morning open, and by noon prices had fully recovered yesterday’s losses, up 1.50 yuan. High‑grade Jiangsu japonica opened at 29.00 yuan; mid‑grade 28.50 yuan; Changzhou fresh japonica 29.00 yuan; Suzhou‑Kunshan japonica 28.50–28.20 yuan; Nankang and Songjiang early‑late indica 27.00 yuan; packaged Songjiang 28.50 yuan; high‑grade Anhui 25.00 yuan; mid‑grade 24.00 yuan; imported Vietnam indica 27.00 yuan; Hong Kong glutinous rice 28.00 yuan. Peidong new japonica from the Shanghai mill sold fifty packages at 27.00 yuan—up 1.00 yuan. City‑wide volume exceeded 7,000 packages.</p>
<p>Non‑local Indica: Although no official export permits have been issued, a small quantity of rice has been shipped in from Huari and Japanese lines by rail and road, and more supplies may arrive. Yesterday, under the rice rally mentality, non‑local indica briefly rose by 0.70–0.80 yuan, but then eased back to 0.50–0.60 yuan above prior levels, with transactions exceeding 3,000 packages.</p>
<p>Imported Rice: Rumors of a new 10,000‑ton quota remain unconfirmed. The market expects higher prices; last week prices opened at 31.00 yuan for new Saigon; yesterday they opened at 33.00 yuan for over 300 packages.</p>
<h3>Flour Steady; Wheat Prices Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, factory quotations remained at 6.00 yuan per bag, cash. Street sales remained active, buoyed by the growing number of rice shops adding flour to their offerings. However, stockists have become more selective since the brief rice price drop, softening demand. City‑wide transactions, including flour sold alongside rice, approached 20,000 bags. Re‑stocking prices from mills remain 0.10 yuan above factory quotes; several thousand bags were sold yesterday at 6.10 yuan. Today’s exports to Tianjin total 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday’s arrivals were brisk—7,000–8,000 packages—but limited rail car capacity has restrained large arrivals. Prices have surged repeatedly over recent days, peaking at 8.90 yuan, demonstrating a sustained rally. Both millers and stockists bought, though under more stringent terms. Overall, 5,000 packages were shipped from Fufu mills to Danyang, Changzhou, Puzhen, and Pudong; stockists shipped over 1,000 packages to Suzhou, Nanjing, and Danyang. Prices softened by a few cents to as much as 0.10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Northern Faction Selling; Domestic Bonds Hard to Rally</h3>
<p>In yesterday’s securities market, sentiment remained weak, and unsubstantiated rumors kept trading subdued. Prices found any uptick promptly met with short selling, making advances difficult. Northern‑backed sellers were active; aside from a few closing trades, new buyers were scarce, especially as rising gold prices dampened enthusiasm. Meeting attendance fell and trading time shortened. Despite lingering price fluctuations, outlooks were cautious. Yesterday’s volume saw heavy sales by “Northern” brokers in the ten Western shares, with Hengkang House leading purchases. Prices initially rose then fell; Alpha shares again broke the 50 yuan mark before being supported by Shunheng. However, Runli and Taiyuan houses continued supplying, and prices ended down 0.35–0.60 yuan, with total turnover around 300,000 yuan. In the afternoon’s black market, prices weakened another 0.10–0.20 yuan. The Chinese Merchants’ Exchange reported the following simplified summary:</p>
<p>Equity trading: Hua‑Shang Securities Exchange handled ten lots of shares at 26.00 yuan each.</p>
<p>Textile Association report: Yesterday’s market remained broadly stable with negligible fluctuations. Recent U.S. rubber figures show July consumption at 43,900 tons vs. June’s 17,300 tons, with stocks at 174,200 tons in July vs. 181,800 tons in June.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Operating Normally; Cotton Yarn Rises Again</h3>
<p>Today the Yarn Industry Association opened for business as usual. The yarn market has turned firm, driven by strong buying interest from South China merchants in 20‑count double‑ply Ma yarn. The market high for 20‑count double‑ply “New Gaoxue” reached 759.00 yuan before profit‑taking trimmed it back by 10 yuan. 20‑count Specialty “Jincheng” hit 775.00 yuan. Some in the market, noting no immediate relief in raw‑cotton producing regions, remain optimistic, though consumption hinges largely on Hong Kong orders.</p>
<p>At the morning open, firm sentiment led to a 10 yuan increase on new mill orders; soon after, Cantonese merchants resumed buying, tightening the market further. Mid‑session saw retail buying cease, prompting an immediate 10 yuan drop. Half‑day trading totaled 725 packages. The net changes were: 20‑count double‑ply Ma +10 yuan; “Sheep” +10 yuan; others +5 yuan. Mills made no moves. Today’s exports: 1,100 cases to Hong Kong. Below is the breakdown of purchases by trade group:</p>
<p>Domestic: 140</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 400</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 160</p>
<p>Northern merchants: 25</p>
<p>Total: 725 packages</p>
<p>Afternoon reports: 20‑count double‑ply mill orders rose further to over 690 yuan, several yuan above open market levels.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Transactions Not Weak</h3>
<p>Domestic and foreign cotton transactions remain fairly robust, though actual sales of domestic cotton have been sparse. Most foreign cotton transactions occur between traders, with mills’ purchases minimal. Shenxin Mill has procured fifty bales of Brazilian cotton at 184.50 yuan each; Yong’an Mill has taken in 200 bales of Havistden at 150.00 yuan each—both paid by remittance. Domestic cotton saw only one deal: 112 bales of fine upland cotton from northern Jiangsu, though supply appears to be dwindling. Japanese merchants remain inactive, so market prices are generally similar to the previous day, with slight firming in higher-grade stock. Below is a record of today’s cotton offerings:</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton    184.50    Shenxin Mill Purchase    Payment by Remittance</p>
<p>American Upland    148.00    Trader Purchase    Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Havistden    135.00    Ditto    Ditto    Ditto</p>
<p>Darlila    127.25    Ditto    Ditto    Ditto</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton    182.00    Ditto    Ditto    Ditto</p>
<p>Havistden    150.00    Yong’an Mill Purchase    Remittance</p>
<p>Pengjiapu    160.50    Trader Purchase    Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>American Staple    113.50    Ditto    Ditto    Ditto</p>
<p>Prf Langong    142.00    Ditto    Ditto    Ditto</p>
<p>Additional information: At the Shanghai foreign cotton market yesterday, slight tightness in exchange rates led to higher spot sales prices. However, Shanghai’s stocks are thin, prompting traders to bid up prices, whereas Chinese-owned mills remain well supplied. Only Japanese mills, facing a shortage of raw cotton, exhibit stronger buying interest. Recently, sellers have not relaxed their asking prices, and buyers have grown hesitant.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market values: The New York cotton market has been unusually quiet of late. At the opening, reports from Liverpool and Bombay of compensatory arrivals for some cancellations spurred some overseas merchants to buy, and Wall Street also held firm. Later, widespread liquidations and a week’s decline in U.S. mill inquiries weakened the market, resulting in a flat performance with mixed gains or losses of one or two points. Indian cotton and futures fell by one rupee, while Egyptian cotton rose by two points.</p>
<h3>Piece-Goods: Fine Cloth Mill Prices Still High, Eastern Pieces Continue to Loosen</h3>
<p>Two days ago, fine cloth mills asked 22.00 yuan per piece; yesterday saw another rise. Morning offers for spot fine cloth were 21.50 yuan—up 0.25 yuan from two days earlier. Before noon, another 0.25 yuan advance was quoted. Heavy-weight coarse twills sell at 0.25 yuan per piece. Other coarse and fine cloths, printed twills, and general-print goods remain mostly stable. Velvet and bleached/printed finished goods are chaotic in offerings; cheaper lines still trade actively. Sichuan-Yunnan agents handled over 2,000 pieces of colored cloth and twill; five large cases of fine cloth and twill; Canton-Hong Kong agents handled over 100 lots of fine, twill, coarse twill, colored twill, and bickram. South Seas demand remains strong. On Main Street, over 200 lots of coarse cloth, twill, and bleached/printed goods traded.</p>
<p>Eastern Pieces</p>
<p>White goods for domestic customers remain sluggish; fine cloth and twill offerings continue to soften. In the morning market, the leading fine cloth spot price fell to 18.45 yuan, later rebounding to 18.55 yuan. This month’s contract stands at 19.00 yuan; next month’s at 19.50 yuan. Miscellaneous brands such as Yanghe, Wufu, Flying Fish, Trumpet, etc., each dropped by 0.25 yuan per piece. Customer orders total some 500–600 lots. Northern routes, especially via Qinhuangdao, show stronger interest. Shanghai Cotton Company took in over 100 packs of leading fine cloth at 18.65 yuan per piece. On the 17th, 650 lots were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Rebounds</h3>
<p>According to London telegrams, raw sugar futures rose another half-penny to 2s.5d; December at 6s.075d; next March at 6s.125d; June at 6s.125d. From the Netherlands, September took a discount back to 6.85 guilders. Hong Kong reports raw granulated sugar at HK$8.00. The local guild set prices higher amid firmer exchange rates and market recovery: spot No.24 raw white rose 0.67 yuan to 1.50 yuan; warehouse sales initially 37.00 yuan, then up to 37.50 yuan; bonded warehouse started at 36.60 yuan, rose to 37.00 yuan, ending at 37.50 yuan. Re-export sugar jumped 1.00 yuan to 1.50 yuan, trading at 29.00–29.50 yuan. Taikoo’s white sugar rose 1.00 yuan to 1.40 yuan. East Warehouse B brand at 42.20 yuan, West Warehouse at 42.40 yuan; CW at 12.10 yuan; CX brand at 41.80 yuan; DY brand at 41.40 yuan; HX at 41.20 yuan; H-brand raw (red) at 26.50 yuan. Dutch red sugar eased slightly, spot at 33.00–33.50 yuan; re-export began at 27.00 yuan, then rose to 27.50 yuan. Domestic raw white cotton sugar regained 1.00 yuan; Zhenji No.1 at 38.00 yuan; domestic No.1 ice sugar likewise up 1.00 yuan to 42.50 yuan; Jingming sugar at 44.00 yuan; Guotang ordinary raw at 35.00 yuan; Huizhou white rose nearly 1.00 yuan higher, at 44.45–44.60 yuan. Over a hundred packs changed hands. On the 14th, 3,500 packs of sugar arrived from Hohei.</p>
<h3>Souvenirs North and South: Gold Hill Branches Tested</h3>
<p>New Gold Hill branch fruit is expensive this season, so no dealers dared try it. Two days ago only 20 boxes arrived as a market trial, with profits or losses disregarded. An initial offering was made yesterday, still unsold. Over 20 more boxes have since arrived, immediately priced nearly 10 yuan higher than the previous day. Sticky rice branches reached 265 yuan, with 22 boxes sold—demand appears tight.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Iron Trade Association Continues High</h3>
<p>Trade in association-standard iron has traditionally centered on local tinplate mills, canners, toy factories, cigarette factories, biscuit companies, and oil merchants. Among outsiders, Tianjin buyers are most active; Qingdao, Yantai, Wenzhou, and Fujian follow. Jiangsu and South China merchants once thrived but have recently fallen off sharply. The only steady demand now comes from local factories and Tianjin merchants. Current stocks are insufficient, sentiment is very positive, and prices are 4–5 yuan higher than before. At present, 200-pound cases of old steel mill stock sell at 120.00 yuan per case; new steel mill stock at 117.00 yuan; “wild” stock at 114.00 yuan; good head-banded stock demands 114.00 yuan—standard cases open around 110.00 yuan. Foreign orders of significant size can arrive in Shanghai within 10–12 days.</p>
<h3>Coal: Manipulating Coal Prices, Insatiable Greed, Another 8 Yuan Increase</h3>
<p>Though foreign exchange rates have recently eased, all grades of coal continue their meteoric advance, especially imported white coal. Hongji Coal peers have already quoted 96.00 yuan, up 8.00 yuan since the 10th. Others, such as Haifeng Mark, uniformly raised theirs—furious waves of increases abound. Truly the work of profiteers, fanning the flames to push prices higher, resulting in bids without trades. We urge coal authorities to stabilize prices for uniformity, alleviating the burden on users.</p>
<h3>Import and Export: Over Twenty Thousand Bags of Beans — Shipped from Tianjin to Shanghai —</h3>
<p>On the 14th, Tianjin shipped in 8,350 bags of beans; Beisha supplied 2,150 bags of beans and 270 cases of peppermint oil; Qinhuangdao sent 8,000 bags of cement. On the 15th, 14,680 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin; Beisha supplied 965 bags of beans, nine cases of peppermint oil, and 60 sheep. On the 15th, 240 tons of beans were shipped to Bombay; on the 16th, 100 pieces of piece-goods were shipped to Yantai and 25 pieces to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Dried Seafood and Spices: Mixed Pepper Market, Fennel Still Absent</h3>
<p>Black pepper, whose stocks are low, remains active, driving prices higher. The other day, several cases were sold: coarse black pepper at 83.00 yuan, No.1 pepper at 85.00 yuan—up 8–9 yuan. White pepper is steadier at 130.00 yuan.</p>
<p>Star anise fennel from Beihai has long been out of supply, and sales are sporadic. Local stocks remain adequate to meet demand, but fresh arrivals are scarce. If rerouted via Hong Kong, it is difficult to arrange. Hence the market tightens, and current bids are at 105.00 yuan—a 20.00 yuan rise.</p>
<p>Medicinal Herbs</p>
<h3>Aromatic Ginger Now on Sale</h3>
<p>With supplies cut off, offers of aromatic ginger are tight and unsold, so transactions are rare. Recently one lot was offered at 33.00 yuan; current bids are at 35.00 yuan—showing firm sentiment.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth: British‑Made Woolens, A Glimpse of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Historically, all woolens sold here were British-made. In recent years, non-Western stock has begun arriving in Shanghai, introducing competitive pressures. Since August 13th, local dealers and tailors have largely favored domestic woolens; if none are available, they order British stock. To verify origin, merchants now alter labels, swatches, and packaging—stamping “Made in England.” Meanwhile, arrivals have decreased, sterling has weakened, and costs for English woolens (already high) stand out in the market. Below is an overview of current British woolen conditions:</p>
<p>High‑Grade All‑Wool Cloth: Across all seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—British-made cloth is supreme. Suiting and tweed varieties excel further and are essential for specialty shops. Although expensive, their texture and substance are remarkably durable; they resist shrinking, fading, deformation, and brittleness unlike any non‑Western cloth. Even German, French, American, Italian, or Russian products cannot match their performance. The enduring popularity of British woolens is well justified.</p>
<p>Cloth with English Script Labels: Still in vogue, these fetch an additional two pence; current prices have risen 0.5–0.6 yuan, remaining higher than unlabeled stock. The long‑established best sellers include TTT Vienna Cloth; A117 French backing; 15330 yuan direct‑import; 4026 raincoat cloth; 1005 riding breeches cloth. White direct‑import from China’s top mills is famed for quality; white bickram for abundance; yellow herringbone from Tianxiang sells well; grosgrain shirting by Ruikang with double floral patterns is most renowned; Hailin strié from Linan brand is oldest. For general outer garments and cheongsam tweeds, the top seller is 9253 in fine weave.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>“I Sing”</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Whether modern literature and art should be determined by content is now rarely disputed. A case in point is the British sculptor Barbara Hepworth’s work “Mother and Child,” featured in a recent magazine. Before reading the caption, one sees only two carved, polished stones—one large, one small. The large block has a hollow; the smaller is placed beside it like a stone pillow. To call this “Mother and Child” reveals the author’s own lack of artistic training. It is said to embody “the subtle beauty formed by volume, line, and motion, beyond the comprehension of laymen.”</p>
<p>Works understood by only a few specialists are not what the public needs. While a less educated audience may not grasp higher art directly, art that even the more enlightened “minority” cannot understand has little real value.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a new poetry collection, I Sing. Though only about sixty pages, it represents ten new poets: ten original poems, three translations, and two theoretical essays. In today’s cultural scene—an “island” nearly devoid of genuine culture—such a little book brings delight. I borrowed and read it thoroughly.</p>
<p>The title I Sing, rather than simply Poems, aptly expresses the real purpose of poetry. Usually poetry in the arts is like philosophy in academics—an abstruse pastime for a few. Yet philosophy is just a system of organized thinking; poetry originates as the most primitive of human song. Singing belongs to the people; so too should poetry. But with private property classes, poetry, like other arts, was sequestered in ivory towers for a time, becoming the lament of a few rather than a song for the many. Even wartime China saw this negative influence: some demanded art unrelated to the war effort.</p>
<p>Rejecting all art unrelated to the war is wrong, but so is interpreting the war’s meaning too narrowly or mechanically. Today, the nation’s war and individual life should form an inseparable whole. Actual life is multifaceted, yet one overarching purpose persists. Therefore, lyric poetry should sing of all facets of life under that shared goal. As Mr. Guan Lu wrote in “General Mobilization of Poetic Spirit”: “We need not sing only of soldiers’ blades and corpses—like Neruda singing the Rhine, Gorky the Sea Swallow, Pushkin the imperial village. The Rhine, sea swallow, and village all celebrate freedom, liberation, and struggle. We can sing any aspect that enriches our real lives. Our lives are real; our singing, too…”</p>
<p>A poet today need not sing only of battlefields, but must sing “real life” (not just its phenomena)—the real life of fostering liberty and liberation. In other words, he must raise a triumphant song of justice!</p>
<p>Due to space and lack of intent to review in full, I cannot analyze each poem in detail. But I Sing differs entirely from the “Mother and Child” sculpture. Though not strictly a “popular” anthology, it is intelligible to any moderately educated reader. Each poem has distinct content, and their craftsmanship shows a plain grace. Perhaps, due to an emphasis on aesthetic technique, some overuse ornate language to stress content—one or two poems invite critique. But overall they are few.</p>
<p>I hope these poets will not rest with I Sing, but expand it into a song for every person with even richer content!</p>
<h3>“Wandering Group”</h3>
<p>— Xu Qing</p>
<p>The road winds along the mountain’s base—sometimes straight to the horizon, sometimes abruptly blocked by a promontory forcing a wide turn.</p>
<p>Marchers open their chests to the July night wind, dispersing summer’s stifling heat. Murmured chatter quiets in pleasure, replaced by soft whistles and the creak of shoulder‑slung yokes—an exchange of hardship for relief.</p>
<p>On one side, the river murmurs its dream‑talk. A slender crescent moon hooks the blue sky, stirring homesickness among some travelers.</p>
<p>“Look! My whole family—only this boy left!” says a man in his early forties.</p>
<p>“Better than losing everyone,” retorts his younger companion stubbornly.</p>
<p>Among the ranks are wounded soldiers, villagers, students, and professors. Forced by a brutal enemy’s destruction thirty miles behind them, they abandoned their beautiful cities and ancestral homes without hesitation.</p>
<p>Students in the rear strike up a familiar marching song:</p>
<p>“People who will not be slaves…” The refrain grows lively, sung a thousand times without fatigue, even as they banter with a soldier whose boots drip moisture.</p>
<p>A short, gray‑haired academic prods them in his Hunan dialect: “University students! Don’t you know night‑march rules? Haven’t you been trained?”</p>
<p>Their laughter subsides, and the villagers in front hush in turn.</p>
<p>Stars multiply overhead; the Milky Way, without notice, shifts its orientation, proudly reflecting in silvered river waters. Night glides forward imperceptibly. In the profound silence, a child cries out:</p>
<p>“Dad! How far to Grandma’s?”</p>
<p>Grievance mingles with reassurance, and the old man’s beard bristles with spittle.</p>
<p>The road is daunting, the night long, yet these wanderers forget, knowing sweet rest comes after burdens are set down; a lovely village awaits after a long march; dawn follows darkness.</p>
<p>“Surely this long journey has a homecoming day!” they think as they gaze eastward—where the moon has slipped behind the peaks, Vega has withdrawn the Milky Way, and a ribbon of pale green dawn seeps through night’s gauze.</p>
<p>“It’s almost morning!” someone cries, hope lighting their face.</p>
<h3>“Hope? Reality? Dream?”</h3>
<p>— by Ni Changmin</p>
<h3>Kitchen Squad Leader (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Yu Hua</p>
<p>Yu Jishi’s 51st Division, 30th Regiment, 1st Battalion, 2nd Company includes Kitchen Squad Leader Bu Guangde, who has held this post for twenty years. At fourteen he joined the army as a camp helper; today he is still the cook. He has fought countless battles. He once thought of leaving, but for the past year he swore: “I won’t leave the service or change roles until the Japanese are defeated—or unless I die.”</p>
<p>Now forty, he looks thirty‑one or thirty‑two. He is robust—able to carry sixty to seventy jin (30–35 kg) up mountains and march 100 li (50 km) in a day. He always wears a smile and is honest by nature. He received four years of schooling as a child, and at age twelve apprenticed at a restaurant, where he learned home-style cooking. Frequent provisioning duty sharpened his skill and mental math.</p>
<p>Since the war began, the 51st Division fought at Liuhe, the Longhai Line, Kaifeng, and south of Xunqian, among many major actions. Bu’s company always joined the fight and was active at the front. Surviving many near disasters, he remains in good health.</p>
<p>Last June, at Jiujiang, his company was stationed at the front; his kitchen was over four li behind the line. After a successful day, the company had reserved ten jin of beef for a celebratory meal. Bu and his assistants cooked eagerly until, just after nine o’clock, eighteen heavy bombers appeared overhead, diving toward their rear. Bu hurriedly extinguished the fires and scattered his men—but bombs fell in large numbers, hitting the kitchen. One shell shredded both the beef and the cooking pot. Of the twelve cooks, six died; the rest were maimed. Only Bu and one helper survived. That was his angriest day—but such trials were countless.</p>
<p>After cooking, he must carry provisions up to the front, regardless of storms or artillery fire. Under Chinese army law, any cook who fails to deliver rations to combat comrades without necessity faces execution.</p>
<p>At Kaifeng, Bu and two cooks carried hundreds of packs to the front. One was shot and killed; Bu carried two packs alone, delivering them slowly. His regiment commander awarded him ten yuan, but Bu said he did not fear punishment; he simply felt for his hungry comrades on the line.</p>
<p>Thus the entire company calls him “Boss Bu.”</p>
<h3>“Observing People” and “Knowing People”</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Someone asked me, “What do you think is the first secret to success for anyone achieving great deeds?” I replied, “Being good at employing people.” He said, “So simple?” I answered, “It seems simple, but it is exceedingly difficult. There are many methods to observe people, but understanding them is vast. Mencius says, ‘Observe their eyes’—focusing on the gaze. Zuo Zhuan says, ‘Raising the heel shows an unsteady heart’—focusing on the step. Seeing from eyes to heels are observing methods, but ‘observation is not hard; knowing is hard.’ Classics say, ‘Knowing people is sage-like’; clearly, to truly know others is wisdom.</p>
<p>‘Knowing people’ is a major discipline; only with it can one talk of ‘employing people.’ Faces are easy to read; hearts are hard to know—‘You can know the face but not the heart.’ Only by knowing the heart can you truly know the person. Some appear gentle but are treacherous; some seem submissive but are deceitful; some are outwardly brave but inwardly timid; some outwardly energetic but inwardly disloyal. Failing to know both fabric and lining, you will be fooled. How then to test? Heart Treatise says:</p>
<p>To know people, use seven methods. First, question them on right and wrong to observe their will. Second, press them with debate to observe their changes. Third, consult them on strategy to observe their wisdom. Fourth, warn them of disaster to observe their courage. Fifth, inebriate them with wine to observe their nature. Sixth, confront them with profit to observe their integrity. Seventh, assign tasks to observe their reliability.</p>
<p>These are secrets of observing and knowing people. Confucius said, “At first I listened to their words and believed their deeds; now I listen to their words and observe their deeds”—a wonderfully complementary insight. Observe will, change, wisdom, courage, nature, integrity, trustworthiness—this encapsulates observing people, and thus knowing people.</p>
<p>Recently I read Zeng Guofan’s reply to Fang Zibai: “Generally, to observe people, see whether they have integrity and honesty as their core; if so, lend them other strengths—that is truly valuable. Without that core, their talents are unreliable. To accept sweet words or flattery is placing form above substance; true standing depends on substance alone.” Though the Heart Treatise’s seven methods are thorough, Zeng Guofan’s one method—observing core quality—is fundamental. Though easy to say, hard to practice, Zeng Guofan’s success lies in his ability to “observe a person’s quality.”</p>

<h3>The Secret of the Sexy Star: An Xiulidan’s Reply</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>Ever since Jean Harlow’s death, An Xiulidan was voted Hollywood’s top sexy star, and many movie fans—especially middle‑aged ladies and young women—have been writing letters to Miss An, asking her to divulge her secret magic spells, wanting to know how one can make any man go dazed and infatuated at first sight, lose all self‑control, and from then on forever bow beneath the soles of her high heels.</p>
<p>Miss An is a very straightforward woman; she doesn’t like to keep people guessing. Below is her public reply to the masses in the newspaper:</p>
<p>You want to make yourself sexy. This is not a difficult task; the whole matter hinges on makeup technique. For example, the most crucial point is that the color of your face powder should be completely different from the color of the lipstick on your lips. Also, when choosing the color of your face powder, it must harmonize with your hair color—this is just a bit of personal experience. However, according to beauty experts, people have eight different natural skin tones, six types of eyes, and eight shades of hair color. So the method I mentioned above is effective for me but may not necessarily apply to everyone; you’ll have to experiment for yourselves.</p>

<h3>Confirmed News of New Actors for the Renewed Stage</h3>
<p>— Nan Qiang Bei Diao Ren</p>
<p>The Renewed Stage is now managed by the Golden Dance Company and will open this autumn. Du Juchu and the Plum Blossom Hall director were invited north to recruit actors. Initially they planned to engage Xun Sheng, but due to unforeseen circumstances that did not succeed. Thus, to the outside world there was much speculation about who would be in the first batch of new actors for the Renewed Stage. According to a telegram sent on the thirteenth from Beiping by the Plum Blossom Hall director, detailing the confirmed information, we print the original letter below for those interested.</p>
<p>"(Omitted above) The first batch of new actors for the Renewed Stage have now been officially invited. The four leading Dan roles are Zhao Xiaolan, Wu Suqiu, Lin Yansiu, and Zhao Jinrong. In addition to performing the ribbon‑cutting on opening day, they will each perform in rotation, half a month per performer. (Xiaolan has made remarkable progress recently. Last night at Qingle she sang all of 'Thunder Peak Pagoda', including the 'Sacrifice at the Pagoda' section in the second line of Huang, performing for thirty‑eight minutes. Her voice is both powerful and richly nuanced, and from start to finish nearly every line was superb. Li Yansiu is the fourth daughter of the veteran actor Li Shunli; her voice is bright, her stature tall; she has become a famous rising Dan in recent years.) The leading Lao Sheng is Chen Shaolin; the Wu Sheng is Liang Huichao; the Lao Dan are Li Duokui, Zhang Jufang, Li Chunheng, and Gao Suishong; (Gao is an outstanding student from the Opera School, excellent in both gong and frame rhythms, and his voice is quite forceful.) The Xiao Sheng is Zhou Weijun (a top disciple of Jin Zhongren; his martial skills are very solid, and his voice is both bright and sweet). The Hua Dan is Wang Shengyi; the clowns are Sun Shengwu, Jia Duocai, Li Yiche, and Wang Shengru… (Middle omitted)… The second batch will consist of Gou Huisheng’s entire troupe; the third batch will be Tan Fuying’s entire troupe; these are currently under negotiation, but it is generally expected they will all be secured. (Omitted below)"</p>
<p>For the starring Hua Dan roles, four were invited at once, performing in rotating phases, introducing fresh faces. Judging from the above list, the roster of roles is quite complete. It is expected that when the Renewed Stage opens in the future, there will surely be a brand‑new atmosphere.</p>
<p>(Editor’s Note: Our paper previously ran “Renewed Stage Invites Famous Actors,” which is the same as the above. Readers are invited to cross‑reference.)</p>
<h3>Cheng Yanqiu’s Original Surname Is “Cheng”</h3>
<p>— Yi Su</p>
<p>By chance I saw in the supplement of the Beiping World Daily an article titled “Cheng Yanqiu’s Surname Is Cheng,” which I found quite interesting and made a note of. Cheng is one of the Four Great Dan and created his own performance style, renowned across the land. Recently Hou Yulan performed at the Golden [Theater] and received high praise, and has now returned home in glory. Because she follows Cheng’s style, she is called the “Female Yanqiu.” From Hou Yulan’s success, one can imagine Cheng Yanqiu’s stature. Yet there is still a secret behind the three characters “Cheng Yanqiu.”</p>
<p>Regarding his name, certainly “Yanqiu” was a homophonic alteration from “Yanqu,” and his honorable surname is likewise altered. His ancestral home was originally in the Banner region; ordinarily one assumes the surnames of Banner people follow the genealogical register, changing from generation to generation. His father was named Li Chenglin, and he adopted his father’s second character as his surname, so he should have been called Cheng Yanqu; but when he first debuted onstage, those writing the playbills thought that the surname Cheng was too uncommon, so on their own initiative they changed it to Cheng Yanqu. They never corrected the mistake, and so he came to be regarded as surname Cheng. Now more than twenty years have passed (now in fact over twenty years), and few people know of this episode. His son, by rights, should have been named Yong; but now it has been decided to abandon the old practice, and from now on his descendants will forever bear the surname Cheng.</p>
<h3>Nan Tiesheng’s Stage Debut</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Mr. Nan Tiesheng has long been honored as the “Mei Lanfang of Hankou.” In his early years he lived in the old capital, where his fame spread far and wide. At every grand public gathering and charity performance, none failed to consider it an honor when the xisheng appeared onstage. His portrayal of Mei in the so‑called “Tiger and Lion Middle General” style, with a sweet and pleasing voice, impressed all. Although Mr. Nan is an amateur enthusiast, his carriage and speech are indistinguishable from a veteran lao sheng, with no flaws. He initially sought instruction from Mr. Cheng, then studied under Wang Yaoqing and Dr. Mei, drawing from the teachings of masters and choosing what suited his temperament, thereby forging a new voice, avoiding the trappings of predecessors. Outside the qingyi role, he is also adept at hua dan; if one cannot both sing and act, one cannot perform such roles. This season at the Golden Grand Theater’s summer hiatus, Mr. Nan was invited to perform charity plays for two days. On the first day he performed “The Pair of Spring and Autumn” (I hear this play was personally instructed by Master Mei). On the second day he performed “Visiting Mother,” accompanied by Mr. Zhao Peixin and Mr. Sun Junqing’s “Fourth Young Master,” which added an extra flourish—a perfect match. The qin accompaniment for Mr. Nan was by the esteemed accompanists Zhou Dongming and Li Shishan; their qin art follows the Xu and Wang schools, and their technique is quite commendable. The two gentlemen are indeed rare talents among the rising generation. Northern and southern famous accompanists performing renowned dramas together is a truly uncommon undertaking. It not only assists those in need but also offers an auditory feast, benefiting both others and oneself—an infinitely meritorious deed. (Payment to follow.)</p>

<h3>Anecdotes Outside the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Long‑Legged General Troupe’s Performance Busy with Hanging and Splitting Plaques</p>
<p>At Zhang’s three‑day hall performance, the program lineup was arranged very neatly. All the famous actors from the old capital, except for Mei Lanfang who had not yet arrived due to other commitments, were invited, including Yang Xiaolou, Yu Shuyan, Xun Huisheng (then known as Bai Mudan), Cheng Yanqu, Wang Fuchen, and Zhu Ren. This time the troupe comprised the entire New Ming troupe and all the students of the Bin Qing Society. Among the performers, aside from those five, there were the solid leads Zhang Chunyan and Bao Jixiang, the renowned jing actor Qian Jinfu, and the martial clown Wang Changlin, among others.</p>
<p>(Also, the Bin Qing Society’s Huang Zhibin, Li Wanchun, and Xiao Guihua, among others, as rising talents of the capital, have also come to Xu, each performing their signature works.)</p>
<p>First day: Xiaolou performed “Changbanpo” (paired with Huisheng); Shuyan performed “Qingdingzhu” (paired with Huisheng); Yanqu performed “Defending the River Pass” (paired with Lin Goufu); the clown performed “Pearl Rashing Moles” (paired with Zhao Zhixiang).</p>
<p>Second day: Xiaolou performed “The Eight Great Hammers” (paired with Shuyan) and “The Set of Fortune” (paired with Qian Jinfu and Wang Changlin); Shuyan performed “Pearl Curtain Fort” (paired with Huisheng, Wang Changlin, Qian Jinfu, and Bao Jixiang); Yanqu performed “The Strange Double Assembly” (paired with Zhang Chunyan, Wu Fuqin, and Wang Yiquan) and “Yutang Spring” (paired with Zhang Chunyan, Cao Ergeng, and Wang Yiquan); Wang Fuchen performed “Three Golden Leopards” (i.e., “The Soul‑Stealing Bell”) and “The Empty City Stratagem.”</p>
<p>Third day: Xiaolou performed “Iron Dragon Mountain”; Shuyan performed “The Gathering of Heroes”; Huisheng performed both editions of “Hongni Pass” (paired with Lin Junfu); Yanqu performed “The Woman’s Liberation” and “Prince Mu of Heaven”; Zhu Ren performed “Capture and Release” (paired with Fu Xiaotian). The main finale was “The Prize Plucking Gathering,” jointly performed by Yang, Yu, and Xun. This play has not been staged in over ten years; it was only added to the program after Mr. Xu and I discussed it the day before yesterday—Mr. Xu being the Long‑Legged’s master. Upon arrival in Xu, the Zhang troupe sent a special carriage to fetch him. As the second day’s performance of “The Eight Great Hammers” was about to begin, I suddenly saw inside the stage gate, on the front row of the main desk, a large red felt carpet. Seated in the center was Mr. Xu, accompanied by Zhang, Chen, and others. He spotted me and earnestly beckoned me forward. I motioned to the armed guards flanking the stage to show I could not pass. Li then asked the Long‑Legged to dispatch a bodyguard to escort me to the front. After a few words, Li introduced me to Zhang, saying, “This gentleman is a drama expert. Taking advantage of the gathering of famous actors in Xu, you might invite Mr. Xu to arrange a play for the last day.” I suggested, “The play ‘Great Battle at Wan City’ is indeed excellent, but it is already well known; it would be better to stage the rare ‘Prize Plucking Gathering.’” (82)</p>
