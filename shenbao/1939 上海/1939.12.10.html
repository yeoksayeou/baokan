<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇芬戰事與國聯</h3>
<p>蘇芬戰事的發生，使世界人都感到突元，因此大家也都很重視。國際與情對蘭表示深厚的同情，對蘇聯不稍原諒。目前戰事雖僅進行了十天，芬蘭的抗戰情况雖極壯烈，但芬蘭的前途黯淡·却無可諱，而各國對芬蘭的援助亦是非常渺茫。據各方面消息，各國對芬蘭已經分別予以援助；但是芬蘭政府外交部發言人却有如下的哀訴：「芬蘭人民現相詢曰，世人對於芬蘭，將有何舉動乎？各方面固皆給以同情，惟吾人所需者，不僅爲同情。如無人來爲芬蘭援助，則此三百萬人民之小國，安能永遠與一萬八千萬人民之蘇聯相抗乎？恐芬蘭行將滅亡，與波蘭同一命運，或更惡劣。故各國口惠實無補於事。」從這幾句話裏可知芬蘭期待切實援助的迫切了。目前芬蘭政府已把這問題向國聯申訴，而本届國聯會議也將把芬蘭問題當做檢討的主題；可是國聯這樣一個告朔餼羊的機關，一向的行動就如老子所說的「豫若冬涉川，猶若畏四鄰」的樣子；這一回關於芬蘭問題，在芬蘭自有申訴的權利，國聯亦自有接受申訴的義務；但事實所示，國聯對於芬蘭問題商討的結果，除所謂道義的安慰以外，一定還是有限的。</p>
<p>援助芬蘭的意義，不就是裁制蘇聯；而各國對芬不能積極援助的原因，決非同情心的不足，即因制裁蘇聯的杆格難行。自蘇聯對芬蘭用兵之後，各方對蘇聯的與論，非難雖同而剛柔不一。這在蘇聯方面，雖宣傳有鑒於世界反蘇運動的存在，所以不得不先發制人，攻打芬蘭；如此云云，雖見得蘇聯對於國際如何憂疑，但國際却亦不會接受這種宣傳，不會是認這種藉口，因此並不怕遭受醞釀反蘇運動的嫌疑，而依然對芬蘭予以莫大的同情。空口同情是不夠的，細微零星的援助是不夠的，而切實有效的援助却在目前爲不可能；所以事實問題，就在於芬蘭政府自身對戰局能否支持，如果能夠支持長久，各國對芬的援助或許會積極起來；否則就不免遭遇慘酷的厄運了！</p>
<p>蘇芬戰事發生後，中國政府當然沒有說明立塲的必要，但中國人民却都表示着無限的關切。因為果蘇聯在芬蘭問題上已確實表示着是一個無限度的略者，那未它是否會「狐埋狐搰」，回過頭來拆中國抗戰的臺？或者聯旣有事於西方，是否會為了它本身的利害關係起見，竟與東方的侵略者取得妥協？這兩點可以說是每一個中國人當蘇芬戰事發生以後共有的疑問。但是事實的表現，上述兩點，或許都是過慮。蘇聯對華的友誼既始終沒有減退的迹象，而且最近一星期內中蘇聯航的告成，恰又足以象徵着友誼的鞏固。至於蘇日妥協問題，雖然東京方面屢作宣傳，但是觀察日本的國體與國民思想的根本上，畢竟不宜效法於德國，有何大轉變。就蘇聯方面觀察之，以前蘇聯進兵波蘭，曾經先和日本訂立了諾蒙亨停戰協定；此次有事於芬蘭，却未聞有此先遣舉動，况且中國與芬蘭不同一格，而東亞與北歐又不可相提並論，所以蘇聯爲自身前途利害打算，亦決不致於賣了朋友養老虎。至於在一個普通旁觀者的立塲上，對蘇芬問題固然不免由正義感而感覺近乎不可忍耐的感情衝動，但是一抗戰第一」，「我躬小閱」，惟有祝望蘇芬之間，終能得到滿美解決方案；至於國聯開會，未必有裨於本問題的解決！</p>

<h3>進攻孟納與防線　蘇聯精銳受重創　湖沼縱橫機械部隊失效用　北部前綫昨發生激烈砲戰　芬軍士氣旺盛固守原陣地</h3>
<p>丹京蘇芬兩國邊境之戰事、使蘇聯軍隊遭遇重大之損失、據丹麥特派訪員稱、蘇聯扣齊茲部隊、以善戰著名、但於誤入芬蘭機關槍陣地後、被殲滅甚衆、該戰區每日廿四小時、幾全部在黑暗之中、故芬蘭軍得利用共熟悉地勢之特點、襲擊蘇聯軍隊、（九日海通電）</p>
<p>芬京此間一般人預料蘇聯之決定封鎖芬蘭海岸、乃擬派兵在維浦利附近登陸之先聲、其目的在從後方進攻、以奪取芬闌之主要防綫即「孟納興」陣綫、芬京人士聞蘇方封鎖之消息、並不驚愕、雖阿波與瑞京間之尋常航運、將因此而停頓、但芬蘭或仍可統制波塞尼亞灣、昨夜聞在喀萊里亞地頸進攻之蘇軍已在數處進抵孟納興陣綫上四大防綫之一、蘇軍在地頸北段沿伏斯基河之攻勢、以昨晚爲最烈、蘇軍人數較衆、故其前進勢難阻遏、惟芬蘭參謀部謂芬軍之撤退、較蘇方所預期者爲緩、紅軍刻在一望無際之松林區域推進、遭遇許多障礙、因有結冰之河流與無數小湖縱橫其間也、大塊土地標識全無、積雪深而地勢崎嶇、在在可爲坦克車之天然陷阱、芬軍現採游擊戰術、能重創敵方　减少自己之傷亡、聞芬軍現仍扼守貝柴摩之陣地、該處蘇軍近已大增、傳說蘇機昨曾轟炸柯索卓基鎳鑛（九日路透電）</p>
<p>芬京北部前錢頃於今晨發生激烈戰事、據可靠消息、蘇聯軍隊曾在三公里長之前綫突出襲擊、但卒爲芬軍擊退、芬軍砲隊轟擊之準確、較紅軍爲勝、凡屬軍事專家咸承認之云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>芬京昨日在凱那期西部方面、蘇芬軍砲戰異常猛烈、紅軍現向芬軍主要防綫進攻、紅軍因其通過之區域中、爲退却芬軍埋置地雷、復因芬軍砲火猛烈、故前進不僅遲緩、且受創甚大、唯戰綫之其他部份並無多大戰事、芬蘭軍事領袖皆認蘇軍現正靜候天氣之轉晴、以便利用飛機作爲進攻「孟納興」陣綫之協助、芬蘭漁人之妻、向來每日爲其丈夫兄弟祈禱天氣晴朗、但至今彼等祈禱時、則多盼望天色之晦暗與多雲矣、日來竟天從人願、氣候惡劣、空軍難於活動、紅軍在蒂包丁河之渡河冀圖、已爲芬軍擊退（合衆電</p>
<p>芬京此間軍界方面頃談　、前綫戰事、數日以來仍屬前哨戰、除雙方巡邏部隊在「孟納興」防綫前「無人區域」發生接觸外、砲隊未有活動、中立國軍事觀察家多人頃自前綫返抵此間、據談稱、在此種接觸中、芬蘭軍隊因熱悉地理之故、顯居優勢、蘇聯巡邏部隊往往迷途、乃被芬蘭軍隊所俘獲、此外、芬軍士氣旺盛、所有軍械及設備均極精良、又據各方面消息、紅軍迭决前進、均由平民爲前驅、此輩殆係蘇聯在波蘭淪陷區內所捕獲之政治犯、（八日哈瓦斯蘿）</p>
<p>芬京蘇聯紅軍昨日攻入納姆區域、各界咸認爲此係紅軍企圖包圍芬蘭孟納興綫之舉動、蘇援軍現已在芬東南集中、向　萊里亞東南前綫與芬蘭東境推進、據軍事觀察家云、紅軍現正用與德軍攻波蘭時相似之戰略、以圖擊破芬蘭之抵抗、但因氣候惡劣及芬軍之頑强抵抗、已使蘇軍計劃受頓挫（合衆電）</p>

<h3>糧食　忍令大衆愁眉呌苦　獨讓囤米者發橫財　市場一進一出坐獲巨利　小民一升一合血和淚併　行情愈抬愈高無所底止</h3>
<p>昨日早市米業開手、據傳到蘇嘉路一帶之貨十四五車、賣戶依然居奇、不肯出樣、一遇問津、遂即高價迭出、無論粳尖行情、霎時喊起二元有奇、常粳竟達四十九元相近、愈抬愈高、將午市面再起反響、此係近數日來米市塲上一貫作風、蓋大批交易多已成就、囤戶操縱反進爲出、獲利了結、只苦了一般薪工階級、終日辛勞、難買斗米、一升一合、血和淚併、坐視奸商操縱自如、獨發橫財、不稍防止、其實只要從各進出口調查到貨、所有到米、集中市塲、分由各米號買進、以應市銷、行市視到貨之多寡、參酌市塲之需要、公開議定、一律遵守、絕對禁止上棧囤積、照此辦法、不數日可使米價立即平定、一面澈查各公私棧房存米、一面則向各洋行調查洋米定額、並飭米業將定貨陳報、然後再籌議整個民食管理辦法、上海民食、即使不能平復如前、終有安定之一日、其如漠然無動於中乎、昨市結果收盤行情、無論粳尖價好半元至近一元、若常帮特粳爲四十八元、中市粳四十六七元、西貢爲三十九元三十八元半也、</p>
<p>客秈晨市與各米一致飛漲、比之前市又大一二元、旋被獲利浮戶售出、且洋米存到兩充、而客秈近來江北京蕪漢口一帶均有零整到滬、元米亦復絡繹搬到、因此後市轉平、然比之前日又漲七八角、</p>
<p>洋米新定難劃、前電數批均未覆到、惟定貨則已大半付裝、昨有二萬五千包在卸儎外、續有二萬二千包到浦待卸中、現貨早市又被囤販投機之把持搗抬、高西貢一度喊到四十元、結果爲卅九元、回籠路貨漸形熱鬧、昨日成交併計有七百四五十噸、價自四十五元半至四十六元一角、均以原包計、</p>
<p>新到洋米昨晨又有三千六百四十包、由太古公司新北京輪自杳港運來、聞該輪尙有運往華北之洋米甚多、確數未詳、</p>
<h3>投機買賣　側重日粉　黃豆又謠傳被統制</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日趨勢平和、蓋緣一再提升、實銷漸清、本街已有某方雜牌粉之傾銷、故成交已不足三萬包、二號粉廠盤、暫居定局、回籠貨砲車粉續開八元五角、惟目下投機以本廠粉旣遭限制、棧單貨籌碼早枯、大都注意買賣日粉、故鳳凰牌等粉市面、頗有出入、昨市初開喊價八元三角、進戶不貪、結果盤旋於二角左右、今日運往天津麵粉二萬四千包、厦門五百包、</p>
<p>小麥來源仍稀、滬存均被行囤執住、不肯鬆落、致市價迭現新高峯、昨市售開僅一車、價開十三元六角五分、</p>
<p>黃豆晨盤因豆油賣買守定局、豆亦未若何變動、行市在行囤出口本街採辦之下、升砌二角、計成交蕪湖豆三千餘包、價爲十七元六角、南京豆三車、價爲十七元一角半、十七元、丁家州豆三四百包、價爲十八元三角、江北豆一百五十包、價爲十六元四角三分、及崇明沙黃五百包、價自十八元一角至十八元四角半、但至午後情形劇變、謠傳所到未卸之貨、突遭扣留、產地一律統制、因之疾風陡起、暗波殊鉅、市塲中賣手絕跡、買戶曾放價半元外、尙乏供應之貨、</p>
<p>黃豆昨日北沙來一百二十包、今日有七十八包運厦門、一千三百七十包運香港、尙有生仁四百廿五包運香港、</p>
<h3>金融　滙市平凡</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市況、滙豐掛牌俱無上落、英美滙暗市、半天情况平凡、偶有上落、範圍亦小、當日經過、晨開英稍報軟、爲四辦士四六八七五、美則仍吿七元二八一二五、嗣因進口商購納本月期貨、兼有利亦扒入若干、故爲狀穩中似稍帶軟，美滙曾緊達七元二五、不久幸港電套賣、且某華行亦有吐出、故狀况頓見回平、午刻買賣更稀、遂於平定狀態下、即吿收盤、英金四辦士四八四三七五、美滙七元二八一二五、與上日相埒、期貨趨勢、仍與現貨相同、</p>
<p>港方尙有售出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期各降一八七五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬·法等各滙俱平、美對英·對滬亦平、對法小一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士四穴八七五、美滙七元二八一二五、較前收、英緊〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、開後洋行首來扒進、外行本月份英金四辦士四六八七五、爲狀穩定無變、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小一分、此後有利前來結進某行現貨美滙七元二八一二五及二五、市况似稍帶軟、但不久港電突來售予華比現貨英金四辦士四八四三七五、其時華行中興亦來塞予大通現貨美滙七元二八一二五、是以過程回平、午刻成交愈淸、故狀態益形呆滯、迄至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四八四三七五、美滙七元二八一二五、本月份英金四辦士四六八七五、美滙七元二五、正月份英金四辦士四三七五、美滙七元一五六二五、結果比隔昨現期英美兩滙、悉無軒輊、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港滙價不動</p>
<p>香港九日電、今晨滙市開盤平平、各地滙債、均無榮辱、十一時〇五分、申滙現貨微升一元、爲三百三十二元、十一時三十分平穩無上落、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英美放長</p>
<p>天津九日電、今日滙市晨開呆滯、英滙現貨鬆一二五、爲四便士〇六二五、美滙現貨亦長二五、爲六元五六二五、申滙微降半元、爲一百十一元、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂二角半、爲九十二元七角半、</p>
<h3>現金呆定　起伏祇哦念元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、因外滙呆滯、故變動殊少、起伏不大、僅有一十元上落、惟潛勢堅定、其中某錢兌業雖續來出籠、及某金號代投機商脫售、但因香港帮不時委某銀樓代辦、其數不少、故終則軋漲十元、晨開即高十元、爲四千一百八十元、嗣後滙市略軟、加以某證券帮及香港帮先後搜入、遂一度盤高、達四千二百元、奈滙市突報回平、某錢兌業及某金號賣意隨之轉濃、雖港帮續有撈入、但一般浮多亦了結不少、故頭寸終難相敵、致午收仍回至四千一百八十元、與晨開相同、午後塲外趨勢續挺、因金號吸收於前、某錢兌業復進繼後、據聞最後價爲四千一百八十八元、半天交易的有二千兩以上成交、銀樓飾金掛高五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開局勢靜而堅俏·九時三十五分開市即抬起十元、錢兌業進金號五十兩、爲四千一百八十元、嗣以某銀號代客撈入、續漲十元、錢兌業互做十兩、爲四千一百九十元、時證券帮塞出數十兩、且銀樓帮亦有吐出、遂回落十元、證券帮售予金號五十兩、爲四千一百八十元、後因外匯穩中帶軟、引起某證券幫等來市搜入‘不久再以港帮委某銀樓代買、復漲二十元、證券帮進余號三十兩、爲四千二百元、旋以港帮止進、價即下挫、某金號與某　兌業互相代大戶出籠、未幾又回落二十元、金號出錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百八十元、後某銀樓又代港帮收買、重抬起十元、錢兌業進證券帮二十兩、爲四千一百九十元、午刻證劵帮續來復出、同時某金號等仍有賣胃、故某銀樓頓然束手、扳價四千一百八十五元、某銀樓再吸進某金號一百六十兩、及散戶數十兩、後因港帮吃胃知足、又回小五元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千一百八十元、作午收價、結果比上日軋漲十元、半天祇二十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進約减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛大五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百二十元、迨至九時五十分掛大五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百二十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進約减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣緊張未弛</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊需要轉殷、市價堅秀、金票供求勢均、英票穩定未更、美票晚市爲十三元六角七分、比前晚僅降一分、可知市價下跌非易、港票法郞票供給未爽、安南票需要見增、市價堅俏、坎拿大票供給稀少、市價昂貴、日金票需要未盛、市况稍弱、晚市爲一元二角四分四厘、朝鮮票亦趨呆滯、晚市爲一元一角三分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升一元、美金票降一分、香港票法郞票俱升五厘、安南票升五分、坎拿大票升二角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>證券　外股成交　至為可觀　內債呆滯</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况愈見呆滯、多數均袖手旁觀、雙方擯持、靜待環境之轉變、目下最簡單之觀測、即美日商約滿期前有無新恊定等、此種未來變化、關係較鉅、目下尙在醖釀期內、昨日戊種舉行抽籤、故市塲交易已除籤計算、較之連籤者小一元餘、若按隔日除籤價尙微好五分、各種公債、祇丙種略有交易、餘則極爲寥寥、市價結果仍祇五分一角之差額、成交數目的三十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大達輪船公司股五十股、價爲三十六元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、成交至爲可觀、實業股中、無論屬於投機或投資類、買方勢力、俱極優越、國際信託·揚子銀公司·會德豐·及鋼業等股獲有新的助力、而呈活潑、怡和紗廠股一度漲至二十六元半高價、電話股收盤二十一元七五有買戶、橡皮股因世界存底、低價下缺乏供給、故有多種業被忽視之股、尤其西門布與薛納王二者、漲勢迅疾、收盤各股俱有買戶、</p>
<p>倫敦八日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票、掛牌行市略有跌落、開平煤礦不記名股跌一先令、爲十七先令六便士、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌六便士、仍爲廿先令七便士、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦八日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍告平穩、上下檔各債券，均無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　本棉交易　愈見熱鬧　獲利轉賣漲勢尙緩美棉趕定的數萬包</h3>

<h3>生氣蓬勃的新都</h3>
<p>— 菊塵</p>
<p>四川—土地面積比日本國本部爲大的四川，其土壤的肥美，物產的豐富，地位的優越，…誰都知道道是我國抗戰的根據地；而掌握這根據地的鎖鑰是巴縣（即重慶）。在從前，四川除成都外，巴縣在全省一百四十六縣中，實居其首，民國廿六年冬，國府遷入巴蜀，重慶就成了新都。</p>
<p>面積行將增加三倍</p>
<p>重慶在本年（廿八年）五月間，又設爲市，牠的面積是一四七方公里左右，最近將四郊各地，劃入市中。勘界的初步工作，業已完成，今年年底，市區的面積可增大三倍。地域擴充，預算當然也可增加，本年度爲三百餘萬元，明年預料可增加七百萬元的收入。計劃建築環城馬路</p>
<p>雖然在這日機往來如織的時候，政府仍撥款一千萬元，建築環城馬路，預計三年完成。大家知道重慶在嘉陵江與長江會合的三角洲上，又有「地無三尺平」之諺，所以可說是多山的半島，築路自然倍覺困難，有些近谷的地方，還須得築六十英尺高的隄岸。所以這一千萬元中，只十分之三用於購地皮，十分之七須用於工程上，足見工作的艱鉅，及政府當局努力不怠的精神了。至於與外界的交通，可說水陸空四通八達，這是母庸贅述的。</p>
<p>築路約計劃，預備明年正月實行，因爲彼時稅收可以增加，並且路築成後，地皮的價値就會增高，將現在賤價買進的多餘地皮，再行售出，則築路費可以失之東隅，收之桑楡，也是値得的事。現在兩江沿岸，頗多貧民窟，將來馬路完成，馬達卡，公共汽車，（也另有許電車。），風馳電掣起來，當令人興滄桑之感罷。</p>
<p>建築隧道及住宅區</p>
<p>另一計劃，擬在市中區及南區連接地下隧道，以免目前車馬行走繞道之勞，同時還可以做防空壕用萬元。如果分三處着手，大約六個月工夫可以完成。</p>
<p>根據疏散人口的辦法，擬在市郊建設平民住宅區，地址已選定數處，並已向中國的銀行借得款項三百萬元，作爲建築費。第一期預備先建四處，繼之以八處。每一處有一個公園，一個運動塲，四週繞以商店及住宅。這些商店及住宅，或由市政府造，或由人民自造</p>
<p>財政的預算及人口</p>
<p>目下的重慶，已成了西北西南運輸的中心地，渡船也正在設法改良了。市內的人口在被轟炸以前為五十萬，現在因爲疏散，只有三十八萬。若非戰時，是不能成爲特別市的。蓋照章特別市須有一百萬的人口，才能成立，得直轄於行政院。</p>
<p>本年重慶的預算爲三百三十萬，百分之三二·〇八用於公衆安全事業，百分之二五·六用於公共建築，百分之一一用於敎育社會事業，百分之三一·三二用於公共衛生事業。明年預備對於敎育經費再加一點。</p>
<p>生氣蓬勃的新都，好像一個火油池，愈矗炸，愈發旺。原來「片葉浮沉巴子國，雙江襟帶浮圖關」的重慶，實爲我國民族「重慶」更生的發源地呀</p>
<h3>新都生活花絮</h3>
<p>— 雅文</p>
<p>假使你到了新都，放眼一看，便要感到無限驚奇；因爲戰時新都，雖曾迭遭轟炸，不但並沒有變成廢墟，</p>
<p>住反而一天興盛一天，民衆都呈現着一種嚴肅而快樂的樣子，大家都相信最後勝利時期已不在遠。馬路上流型錢的汽車，絡繹不絕，被炸的地方，馬上又蓋起竹篾所造的平房。魚市街武庫街都郵街勸工局街一帶的地價，每方丈漲到七百餘元，而地主仍然不肯脫手。商店的貨物，應有盡有，只要你出得起價錢，甚麼化妝品，照像材料，呢絨嗶嘰，罐頭食品，俱可隨意選購到手。</p>
<p>衣新都市民的服裝，異常樸素，娘兒們以穿藍布面子的旗袍爲最時髦，安安藍布，在新都市面上供不應求。普通男子們則多喜着布製的中山裝，西裝店工價殊貴，普通三件一身的西裝，除呢料外，工資非三十元不可；所以着西裝的人不若上海多，男女學生則一律着規定的制服，在街頭行走，整齊之至。新都高貴婦女，沒有着高跟皮鞋的，因爲市府規定妓女始着高跟皮鞋，所以沒有人願意仿效。</p>
<p>食飲食方面，除川菜館外，其他各式菜館，無不俱備，粤菜如大三元，冠生園；蘇州菜如松鶴樓，北方菜如燕市酒家等，寗波菜有四明消夜館，揚州菜有瘦西湖，甫京菜有國泰等數家。無一家不生意鼎盛，每晚電燈來火時，總是座無隙地，吐出一批人，又呑進一批人。西餐社雖亦有數家，但因鮮魚產量不多，奶油製煉不甚得法，味道不如上海佳。現又新開俄國菜館數家，一小鍋羅宋湯，略佐麵包，所費不多，即可果腹，所以人多趨之，生意亦頗不惡。</p>
<p>行新都的馬路，雖不及上海廣闊，但行人都能遵守走路的規則，因此狹窄道上，雖充滿行人，決不會發生擁擠衝突，尤其是集會的時候，羣衆的遵守秩序，魚貫而入，決無爭先呌囂的聲浪，這一點頗引起外僑的讚嘆。</p>
<p>衛生　新都本地人，頗具有倪瓚潔癖，市內浴室，較其他地方爲多，且普通浴室，均備有招待女性之所，並有所謂家庭浴室，普通家庭都携眷前往同浴，浴費以時間計算，每小時一二元不等。現市府當局因恐有人携帶妓女冒充眷屬前去沐浴，爲維持風化起見，已通令經營浴堂者，將男女浴室，加以分開，不准再行同浴，並不得招容留宿。</p>
<p>外僑　新都的外國僑民，最近的三百六十餘人，（海軍除外）女性佔三分之一，其中大部份是使館職員和傳敎士。其餘便是商業經營的代表人。自默戰發生後，英德法各國的僑民，在咖啡館中的談話，開口閉口都是關於祖國戰爭的消息，他們隨時準備遄回爲祖國服務。</p>
<p>空防　新都空防佈置，極爲周密，現又新掘防空壕洞多處，分城區江北南岸三大區，共計有五百餘壕洞，總共可容六萬餘人。遇有空襲時，防空司令部即用電笛警鐘發出警報聲，民衆聞警，絕不慌亂，相率避入壕洞，且有手挾書冊，在防空洞中就石油燈或手電筒之光不輟誦讀的，態度鎭靜，可見一斑。</p>
<h3>重慶的物產及啊商業</h3>
<p>— 紹唐</p>
<p>重慶產米不多，半賴隣縣供給，雜糧如馬鈴薯玉蜀黍花生芝蔴及各種豆類之產量，則極爲豐富，尤以豆類一項爲最，蓋因氣候關係，較下江早熟，雖在隆冬之季，可食新鮮豆類。此外家畜中如雞鴨水果中如橙柑橋柚生梨等之產量，亦極豐富。鑛產開發甚少。附近山中所採取者以煤爲主要品；南岸石油溝地方，有石油天然流出，可資應用。</p>
<p>工廠最著名者爲四川絲業所辦之改良絲廠，全市織布機共有四千餘架，南岸有水泥廠，規模極大，產量足供四川全省之用。川渝豬鬃廠所出之漂白豬鬃，銷行歐美，尤著盛名。自抗戰以來，滬漢各地遷往內地之工廠，據經濟部調查，共有三百四十餘家，其中機器五金業約一百五十家，電氣無綫電業二十餘家，化學工業約四十家，陶器玻璃業約十家，飲食品工業的廿家，紡織業六十家，印刷業四十餘家。其中十分之四移置川省，有一部份已在重慶開工，紗廠有慶新裕華豫豐大成等四家，據該業表示，刻下重慶紗廠綻，合計有五萬餘。商業出口貨以桐油生絲藥材豬鬃牛革羊皮等爲大宗，進口貨則以疋頭棉紗五金蘇貨顏料等爲大宗，出口貨中以桐油最著盛名，佔我國出口商品之第一位。銀行除聚興誠中中交農四行外，上海銀行浙江興業銀行等亦均設有分行。金融活潑，氣象日新。</p>
<h3>重慶的交通</h3>
<p>重慶因三面環水，故交通以水道稱便，各國航行長江輪船西上者，向以此爲終點。戰前川人盧作孚氏所經營之民元民本二巨輪，曾直航渝滬，下水只有十天，上水不過二星期，即可到達。現因戰事關係，下游航行只開至宜昌爲止，上游則駛至嘉定，北上則駛至合川爲止。此外有小輪船行駛各地，如渝涪綫由重慶至涪陵，渝木綫由重慶至木洞，渝松綫由重慶至淞溉，渝溫綫由重慶至溫泉，渝磁綫由重慶至磁器口。鐵路有成渝綫，刻正在建築中，尙未通車。公路主幹分西向與南向兩綫，西向之綫，由重慶直達成都，全程計四百五十公里，此綫可啣接西北公路，南向之綫直達貴陽，全程計四百八十八公里。此外尙有渝沅公路，由重慶至湖南沅陵，全程計九百九十三公里，惟尙未能完全通車。由重慶至磁器口，亦有短程汽車通行，稱爲渝磁綫，由重慶至貴陽一段，尙有海溫支綫，由重慶海棠溪開至溫泉，由重慶至成都一段，尙有靑北支綫，由重慶靑木關開至北碚。市區內有汽車公司所辦之公共汽車駛行，共分四路，一路行駛曾家岩與過街樓之間，一路行駛通街樓與菜園　之問，三路行駛大溪溝與化龍橋之間，四路駛行小什字至上淸寺之間。此路所經各站，本爲第一路之中段，因第一路乘客過多，爰增設第四路以减少擁擠。商用航空，有中國航空與歐亞航空兩大公司，均有定期班機飛行。中國航空公司飛行桂林香港貴陽河內昆明瀘州　叙府嘉定萬縣　宜昌與成都各綫，歐亞航空公司飛行桂林昆明河內成都漢中西安蘭州寗夏凉州西寗各綫。郵政爲東川管理局之轄區，除總局外，共有十二支局，分布全市。電報現已擴大成立川康藏電政管理局每日平均收發電報在一千八百通以上，接轉者亦達七千件左右，國際電報通常均由無綫電或水綫傳遞，國內電報亦因綫路關係以無綫電傳遞者較多。長途電話，除軍用外，</p>
<p>嘉陵江邊的大佛可直接通話地點，有成都實陽內江夾江樂山綦江萬縣梁山長壽巴東墊江奉節南溫泉昆明香港等處。今春又曾與新疆之迪化及甘肅之蘭州試通無綫電話，成績良好，想不久亦可開放了。</p>
<h3>重慶的鹽井</h3>
<p>— 浣瀾</p>
<p>俗語有句話：「開門七件事，柴·米·油·鹽·醬·醋·茶。」鹽雖居在第四位，其實牠的重要，實不亞於柴·米·油。因爲人人需要，所以國課中鹽稅實爲極重要的一項。</p>
<p>盬有岩鹽　鹽及井　專，四川的鹽出自井中，謂之井鹽。在數年前，全省有二十三區鹽塲，從事燒製。統計鹽井有八千八百餘處，重慶附近也有不少。井鹽因爲滷質淡薄，平均製鹽一斤，要蒸發水二十斤左右，當此燃料昂貴的時候，成本也就隨之而貴了。據今年十一月杪報載，由某化學工業社，介紹法德兩國之篠枝曬法製成曬架，在牛華溪鹽塲實騐，成績極佳。此法能節省燃料，使其天然蒸發。據云曬架每具的三四千元，但全省實行起來，可省一千萬元的然料費。</p>
<p>圖爲重慶的鹽井，木架及輪槃係取滷的轆轤，即物理學中所說的，利用支點减少勞力之滑輪裝置。</p>
<h3>重慶地方簡誌</h3>
<p>— 紹唐</p>
<p>重慶地當東經一〇六度三七分四八秒，北緯二九度三五分十秒，地勢高度海拔二四〇尺，位置當嘉陵江與長江合流處，三面環水，一面通陸，兵家謂其扼水陸要衝東下荆夔，西指成都，南走黔滇，北顧漢中，形勢至爲險要。在周代爲巴國，姬姓子爵，秦漢時爲巴郡地，晋朝改爲巴都那，隋初改爲渝州，煬帝時又改爲渝郡，唐時復改爲渝州，甫宋孝宗時始改爲重慶府，元立重慶路，明仍改爲重慶府，淸仍之，民國初年廢府爲縣，二十五年析置市，至二十八年改爲直轄市，直隸於國民政府行政院，全市面積共一百七十四方公里，淸光緒十六年因中英北京追加條約，許爲通商口岸，光緒二十年中日馬關條約，闢爲商埠。</p>

<h3>重慶的名勝</h3>
<p>— 紹唐</p>
<p>重慶環山帶水，勝蹟甚多，最著名的爲南北二溫泉。南溫泉距城約四十里；水源自建禹山而來，溫度常保持至華氏表四十四度，含硫黃質甚多，故能洽療各種皮膚病。大泉以外，尙有小泉兩處，一名子泉，在溫泉塲後面覺園內，水量甚小，並不公開。一名小溫泉，在花灘溪左岸，距溫泉塲約三里，北溫泉在嘉陵江下游溫湯峽，離重慶水程一百四十里，民生公司每日有專輪行駛；陸路較水路略近，僅七九·五公里，游人如走陸路，可由靑木關乘公路汽車到北碚，由北碚再乘溫泉公園之游船即可直抵北溫泉。泉水分三股從山麓湧出，溫度較甫溫泉稍低，冬日較溫，夏日較凉，與南溫泉溫度終年不變小同。據中國西部科學院化騐結果，北泉溫度最高時在攝氏表三十七度上下，所含礦質，石灰成份稍多，但亦可治療皮膚病。南溫泉附近名勝，有建文峯，相傳明建文帝曾遁跡此峯，山巓原有建文廟，惟年久失修；廟內屋宇，多半頽毀。北溫泉附近有高坑岩，瀑布橫飛；高的百餘尺，寬近二百尺，人於三丈內不能逼硯，爲北溫泉左近最奇偉之風景。此外尙有金碧流省洪崖滴翠等巴渝十二景及園林別墅山洞寺院諸名勝地，不勝紀載，茲從略。</p>

<h3>重慶婦女的戰時工作—服務的精神比男子有過無不及—</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>在重慶的街市上，時常可以看到有一隊隊的中國少女面孔和皮膚被太陽晒得漆黑，口唱軍歌，後面背了毛毯等東西，步伐很整齊，她們在蔣夫人的領導之下，生活是有規律的，軍事化的。在這些女子裏面，有四百五十人是來自長江下游，最年輕的祇有十四歲，但爲了要加入婦女戰時服務團而推說十五歲了。她們曾在湖南受過軍事訓練，現在，她們在蔣夫人領導之下，從事各種戰時工作。她們在後方祖任些敎導小學生怎樣唱軍歌，怎樣防空襲的工作並參加民衆集會，慰勞征人家庭，改善人民和軍人間的關係。</p>
<p>五月三，四兩日，重慶曾遭過日機慘烈的轟炸，總共死的有五千人，受傷的也有一千人，她們就參加各種救護的工作，服務的精神，較男子有過之無不及。同時，在重慶的附近，蔣夫人更設一新生活紡織廠，計劃招收服役軍人的妻女一千，使她們各有工作。最初是半工半讀，除了授以紡織技能以外，更敎以音樂，語言，算術等科目，畢業之後，實行合作，可以半價購買紡織機，並得分期付款，軍人的家庭，向廠方購物，更得享特別折扣</p>
<p>自漢口，廣東相繼淪陷之後，在戰區中救出的難童，載到重慶的，至少有一萬以上。關於救濟，敎養等工作，完全由婦女界負責進行。目前重慶的婦女團體很多，但完全由最高的婦運機關統率指揮是統一的。天是寒冷了，征人的寒衣在急切的需要着，所以近來重慶的婦女界，又在忙着縫製寒衣。關於這種工作，在蔣夫人領導下，當初在漢口時早已有過相當成績，這次自然也不會遜色的。</p>
<h3>重慶漫談</h3>
<p>自重慶市物價評定委員會成立後，規定重慶物價以本年十一月二日之市價爲準則，以後不准高漲。計上等米每市担標準價爲十六元，菜油每市斤標準價六角六分。</p>
<p>據本年八月份外人斯坦因的調查，重慶附近由上海漢口遷移過去的工廠有三百八十六所，機器六萬五千噸。</p>
<p>本月九日間敎育部推動社敎工作，除創立戰時社敎工作團四出服務外，計民衆學校有學生一千餘人，婦女補習學校有學生六百餘人。</p>
<p>全國最大的防空壕在重慶，壕內可容萬人，並裝有抽氣機及發電機等。</p>
<p>重慶的乞丐都被收容，施以軍事訓練。</p>
<p>重慶的勝蹟及古跡的有十二處：中央公園，將軍墳，羅漢寺，江北公園，禮園，老君洞，眞武山，南山，華岩，老鷹岩，南溫塘，北溫塘等。</p>
<h3>四位新部長</h3>
<p>— 冠卿</p>
<p>中國國民黨第六次中决全體會議，最近在新都重慶舉行之後，關於黨務，推定了四個新部長。一爲新宜傳部長王世杰氏，湖北人，現年四十八歲。他早歲就畢業北洋大學，隨即赴英國倫敦大學深硏經濟敎育和政治諸科，後又至法國巴黎大學攻讀法學，得博士學位歸國，被聘任北京大學憲法學敎授。及一九二八，敎部聘爲國立武漢大學校長，辦學認眞，深得蔣委員長賞識，翌年，即長敎育部，學界頗崇仰氏之廉潔刻苦。氏著有「比較憲法學「中國奴隸制」等書。少年時，聰穎而勤讀，在留學期間，各西洋敎授咸贊獎氏性之敏行和好學。氏待人和藹可親，一身以學者之精神從政，素以廉潔著稱於政治和敎育界。</p>
<p>二爲新組織部長朱家驊氏，字騮先，現年四十七歲，浙江吳興人，爲德國柏林大學哲學博士。歸國後，歷任北大，中山大學和中央大學敎授，廣東省政府委員兼民政廳長，敎育部長，交通部長，中英庚款董事會董事長（現尙在職）。朱氏少年英俊，博學廣識，談吐活潑流利，辦事負責，急公好義，是中國靑年政治家之柱石</p>
<p>三爲新組織部長吳鐵城氏，爲一典型軍人和學者，現年五十一歲，廣東中山縣人，生於江西。早歲留學日本，爲總理得意鬥徒，曾任江西省參加南京全國代表大會代表，總理諮議。旋任廣東公安局長兼憲兵司令，部下以驍與著，後改編爲國民軍第十七師。後復任中央立法委員，上海市長，抗戰軍興時，調任廣東省政府主席。氏擅長交際，更熱心公益慈善義舉，他身材魁梧，氣慨豪爽，蔣委昌長很賞識他是一個多材而又多藝的人物。</p>
<p>四爲新社會部長谷正綱氏，貴州人，他很熱心於黨務，辦事勇於負責，歷任中央執行委員會候補委員，組織部副部長，實業部參議等職。谷氏從政廉潔刻苦，凡有益黨國和國人的事業，他不肯稍讓於人，故中央深爲倚畀云。</p>
<h3>重慶的霧値三千萬</h3>
<p>重慶一交冬令，就爲大霧所籠軍，一直要到來年初夏，始行晴朗。這種霧有牠的壞處，也有牠的好處。壞處是一有大霧，不見太陽，氣候很壞，人在這樣環境中極爲不舒適。好處是爲有了霧，飛機容易迷失方向，同時又恐觸及四周的高山，而使飛機撞毀。所以一交冬令後，日本往重慶去的轟炸的飛機，就不大有了。這是天然的防護飛機轟炸的利器。參政員陶行之先生今年春天到香港演說時，曾說過「重慶的大霧，要値三千萬，」他的解釋是：要重慶防空周密，至少須一百尊高射砲，每尊砲如果以三十萬的代價計算，那末就需要三千萬。重慶一有了霧，日本人就不敢去森炸，那末重慶的大霧，不是値三千萬麼？</p>
<h3>影劇在重慶</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>爲了戰事有幾家影片公司，自上海遷至南京，由漢口搬到重慶。過往很著名的電影明星，現在已參加中國的精神動員，使他們的生活降到最低限度，不論是服裝或食物，都是這樣。擔任主角的女明星，目前每月祗支生活費六十元。爲了各種準備，工作却非常忙碌，而對於薪水，好像感覺不到什麼。據當地的人士說，重慶的光綫很壞，影片的製作，有時竟因而停頓，甚至四川的狗，看見了重慶的太陽也會恐怖而狂吠起來，可知有時爲了光綫，是不能拍戲的。</p>
<p>然而有一部分電影明星，對於光陰是非常珍惜，就是不拍影戲，也會利用餘閒做些工作。尤其是過往演過舞台劇的，就加入合法的劇團，在重慶和鄰近重慶的鎮市上演戰時戲劇，喚起一般的民衆。目前重慶的戲劇團體很多職業的，業餘的，靑年學生所組織的，都站在同一的戰綫上表演救亡戲劇，從事劇運，是相當努力，所以差不多每天有劇團在上演</p>
<p>歐戰發生以後，外匯又逐步緊縮，攝影的材料，不但來源减少，而且售價很貴，製片的成本也就加高不少。但在重慶的影片公司，尤其是「中製」和「中央」兩廠對於製片工作，更在積極進行。所攝的影片，更全是含有抗戰意識的。目前在西南各地大小城市之中，所映的影片，也就全是這種出品。在這裏，已不難看出，重慶的影劇運動，在極力推進哩！</p>

<p>自從戰事發生以來，號稱孤島的上海，產生了很多的難童，雖說由各慈善機關收容撫養，但因人數過多，不勝收容，由是在街頭巷尾，隨處可見流浪的兒童，道輩可憐的小孩子，有的雖有父母，爲了事變後，離鄕背井出來，中途各自分散，有的更是連父母也沒有的，他們的生活多麼悽慘！每日躑躅街頭，拾荒的，求乞的，更有作偷竊行爲的都有，其中作偷竊行爲的流浪兒童，固然犯罪，但因其知識幼稚，且未足法定年齡，法律上每以年幼無知，從寬處置的。</p>
<p>可是最近本報所載，「流浪兒童犯罪史」，情形却有不同，按前日所載：「上海流浪兒童林美源，年十三，日前在南京路偷竊貴重物件，被緝獲解送法院，法官以是兒年輕，轉送工部局兒童保障科，據該兒自述：由叔父林長春，自奪波帶來上海，即敎以偷竊方法，各慮竊物，由叔變賣一人化用，有時不願去偷，其叔即加毒打，直至屈服始已」云云，這眞豈有此理！林孩自知偷竊是犯罪行爲，不願去做，那知這無賴叔父，偏任主使毒打威迫，爲其利用，這犯罪的成立，完全爲無賴的叔父所造成，應該設法拘獲，從嚴懲處！而這林孩天性朱泯，從善可嘉！</p>
<p>偷竊是不道德的犯罪的劣行，何况敎導無知的幼童，趨於犯罪的途徑，而自身反逍遙法外，這是何等罪大惡極！但社會間儘有成人偷竊，孩子學樣的，像這林孩能自覺悟，辨別善惡的却不多，還望負社會之責者，對於天性純潔的孩童，應該自幼導入正軌，以免成人後爲非作惡，更引誘他人同流合汚才是。</p>
<h3>常識問答</h3>
<p>— 陳志鋆</p>
<p>問：桃梨被咬的地方，為甚麼會起黃褐色的？</p>
<p>（答）桃梨等某品，裏面都含有多量的鐵質，我們把皮咬去以後，鐵質就和空氣接觸，起氧化作用，故變色。</p>
<p>（問）熱水洗衣爲甚麼比冷水淸潔</p>
<p>（答）塵垢的微粒，常給油膜黏在衣服上和皮膚上，熱水能够把這油膜變軟和溶解在水中，故較淸潔。</p>
<p>（問）河水爲甚麼兩旁較中央流得慢？</p>
<p>（答）兩旁的水，因岸邊有沙土等的阻力，所以流得慢。中央的水，阻力較少，故流得較快。</p>
<p>（問）太陽爲甚麼早農大，到午較小？</p>
<p>（答）早晨太陽光平射地面，穿過很厚的空氣層，射到眼睛中，光線已經不很强烈了。我們眼睛受到這種光線，瞳孔用不着收縮，瞳孔不收縮以後，就覺得大。到中午時太陽直射地平，穿過的空氣層，較早晨稀薄，光線射到地面的光很强烈，我們眼珠接受這種光線，瞳孔非收縮不可，瞳孔收縮後，就覺得小。但是日常的物件，因視覺的關係，不論遠近，瞳孔收縮多小，都是一樣的大。</p>
<p>（問）雨後的花，爲甚麼嗅着更香？</p>
<p>（答）原因有二：（一）因下雨以後，空氣淸新，香味顯着濃厚。</p>
<p>（二）因下雨以後，花心噴放香氣的細孔，都被洗濯通達，能出多量的香氣，故雨後的花，嗅着更香。</p>
<p>（問）食物嚥下時怎麼還要用力呢</p>
<p>（答）胃中有空氣，要有勝過它的上壓力，故嚥下要用力。</p>
<h3>野火—明兒避難記之四十六—</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>眼見得那太陽打從東方的山隙間昇將起來，漸漸地，慢慢地在西邊的丘嶺後沉沒下去，一天又這樣的過去了。睡了吃，吃了睡，糊裏糊塗的把日子白白的消耗。氣候也隨着日子而轉變到和暖，那表示冬將逝去而春將來了。地面上的生物，由死亡的屍體中醞釀着它們的新生命，微微地甦醒，便稍有一絲生氣。</p>
<p>山峯巓，地面上，丘壑間，水溪邊，到處都是殘體狼籟衰黃的野草，死去的枝條，荒蕪的稻桿，枯敗的老葉，眞可憐！這些大自然的遺物，沒人收殮，便腐敗的腐敗，踐踏的殘踏，全是一片凄凉的氣象。</p>
<p>經過了這一個漫長的隆冬，春竟然來了。枯草敗葉畢竟腐敗不了許多，踐踏不了多少；依舊密佈在大地上，沒有消減，似乎想永永不朽，長留在茫茫無際的荒野裏，可是冬去春來，它們的子孫重又生長，然而被那遺體壓榨得不能十分動彈，給與它們的子孫一重生命的打擊，村子裏的人們似乎很懂得，自然而然到了這時，沒有人再往山裏去砍柴了，無形中成了一種不成文的法律。這一片成千成萬的枯草要是任它們縱橫枕藉，再加以將來新草的長成，便要妨礙他們耕種的田畝，如果把這些草一起削去，倒是件不容易的事，因此在這靑黃不接之際，便有燒山的壯舉。</p>
<p>近幾天來，村子裏祠堂的牆壁上，可以發見一張張從縣城裏派人來張貼的布吿：禁止燒山，一是保護樹木，二是顯露飛機投彈的目標。然而布吿盡它去公布，山是不可不燒，這種陽奉陰違的舉動，使人奈何他不得。</p>
<p>這是一個漆黑的晚上，明兒家剛吃好了晚飯，發見那正對他們屋子的山麓下，一球熊熊的火光，似乎是一團火球，在四周黑暗中打着滾，顯得格外的耀目。火球遂漸向山腰裏滾去，它的面積也擴大了，一星星的火花四射，火舌血紅地舐着，它所要呑沒的目的物。那光茫閃爍着，把黑幕消滅得無踪無跡，在它的勢力範圍內，勢無忌憚的蠻榦着。枯草本已風吹日晒得異常乾燥，只消遭到一點火星便足以着火，一縷白烟和火熖，把它衰黃的本來面目改造成一攤黑灰，一陣風驅逐它到不知那裏去了？火熖更劇烈的飛散開來，火舌具有一股無窮盡的野心，拼命的向它附近的地方擴展着。樹木的爆裂聲，野草的燃燒聲，和着火熖的暴炙聲，東風的在呌聲，形成了大自然的交饗曲。火熖似野牛般的把這一大片的枯草呑下肚去。它更蔓延到一個小山丘上面着火了。一片融融的火光，把站在屋子裏觀光的明兒，也照耀得很光亮，可是野火仍是勢不可遏，然而倒底有它窮途末路的時候，不久便消滅了。</p>
<p>那山麓下便成了一片焦土，似乎受到砲火的洗禮。明兒更遙想到那一片錦繡河山！不禁起了一陣惆悵！侵略的火熖終有消滅的一天！而新的生命仍能從焦土中建立起來！</p>
<h3>野驢與鶯</h3>
<p>— －克里洛夫寓言－趙易林譯</p>
<p>有一天，驢子看見一隻夜鶯。他對夜鶯說：「我親愛的，你聽我說：他們說你唱歌唱得非常的好，我老早就想聽你唱歌，看看你所唱的，是不是他們所說的一樣的好？」夜鶯聽了這話，就唱了起來。它用各種的調子唱，宛轉和鳴，從這個歌唱到那個歌。一會兒，聲音極低，遙遠的蘆葦也發出低低的回聲來；一會兒，一陣細小的調子，灑到樹林四處，差不多沒有一個人不聽這些歌的。微風吹過，鳥下停了下來：牛也躺在草地上。牧童聽了歌聲，也屛着氣，一面聽，一面向牧羊女郞微笑。</p>
<p>終於歌聲停止了。於是驢子把頭俯向地上，批評道：「我聽得難過得很！講老實話，沒有一個人聽見你的歌聲，不會感到疲倦的。可惜你不曾聽見過我們的公鷄呌，如果你向公鷄學習，你可以唱得好一點…</p>
<p>夜鶯聽了這；睬也不睬他，早巳飛得很遠了</p>
<h3>藍矮子　（十一）</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>矮人見阿麗沒哦話說，便又說道：「晚餐已預備好了，他們正在等候着呢？」阿麗轉過身去，見那邊一座屋子，比其他的屋子大得多，那高度似乎恰够給伊戀着腰走將進去。伊從窗子裏向屋子望時，見有一張長長的桌子，上面鋪着淺藍色的毯子，安放着許多小巧的碟子，碟子旁邊又放着一柄刀，一柄又，和一隻藍色的小玻璃杯。桌子兩頭又放着兩隻很大的碟子，熱氣蒸騰的，有一股美妙的香味，從窗子裏送將出來。阿麗開着香味，一壁想道：「我倒並不覺得饑餓，他們既請我去吃，那就不妨叨擾一頓，但願他們不要請我去吃松樹上的松子呢。」那矮人似乎知道伊的意思似的，在旁說道：「他們一定會給你預備些好吃的東西的。」於是他發出一聲又急又銳的口哨，衝破了沉靜的空氣，霎時之間，全村的矮人好像表演魔術一般，立刻出現在眼前，忽忽地走進屋子，但是一進甬道，就分站在兩旁，讓出中間一條路來。先前的那個矮人很謙恭地鞠躬道：「請進。」</p>
<p>阿麗欣然問道，「你們　夜用晚膳時，都是這樣。集合攏來的嗎？那是何等的有趣啊？」那矮人答道：「並不如此，不過在公共宴會時召集一下罷了姑娘，請進去坐下來吧。「阿麗便不再開口，低倒了頭，很小心的預備走進門去，誰知突然之間，又聽得一聲又急又銳的口哨使伊吃了一驚，抬一抬頭，却砰的一聲，就在門楣上猛磕了一下，痛得什麼似的。當下伊惱了，放聲喊道：「這－這又是什麼一回事？為什麼又沒來由的吹起口哨來，使我嚇了一跳，我－」以下他沒有話了。那口哨的聲音却又來了一下，就把阿麗驚醒過來，原來做了一個夢。</p>
<p>阿麗將信將疑的，還不知道自己是醒是夢；伊瞪着眼向四下裏看時，見是一片漆黑，身上又僵又冷，頭上還元自隱隱作痛，原來剛才在那老樹幹上磕了一下。伊定一定神，却聽得遠處又起了口哨之聲，原來是早起的鳥在那裏開始呌伊夢中聽得矮人的口哨，原是就鳥呌。</p>
<p>伊抽抽咽咽地自言自語道：「呀！呀！這怎麼好呢？我的身子到底在那裏？在這樣一片黑唁之中我又怎樣找着路走回去呢？咦，我知道了，這一定是那些藍矮子在那裏搗鬼，在作弄我，相信自己是在做夢。我料知那些矮人也是妖怪，我不該跟着他們到村子裏去的。」於我不是伊又靜坐了好幾分鐘，一半兒睡，一牛兒醒，仍然蹲在那老樹旁邊，好像要它保護伊似的。如此又捱過了好些時候，伊的意識漸漸地回復過來，心想一動不動的老坐在這裏總不是辦法，必裏須設法找出一條路來，回到那小客店去，料想伊的伯父伯母正在給伊担憂，不知道伊迷失在那呢？伊想到這個，幾乎放聲痛哭起來。</p>
<p>可憐的阿麗，終於掙扎着站起身來，接着想起了伊所帶的書和傘，伸手同地上一摸，居然好好的仍在樹邊，伊卽忙取來挾在臂間，搖搖擺擺的向前走了幾步，心想伊要是走出了樹陰，那就不會這樣的黑暗了。道一點，倒不曾使伊失望，伊遠遠地離開了那老樹之後，果然覺得亮了一些，然而夜色總是黑暗的，還不能發見一綫的曙光。在這樣的黑夜中，要找到一條走出森林的路，實在不是一件容易的事，倒懊悔先前不該冒冒失失的闖進這森林來了。</p>

<h3>搜孤救孤（上）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>八義圖演春秋時代晋國趙氏興滅之史跡、趙氏自宣子至武子，祖孫屢受磨難，多賴義人相救，始得保全，謂之八義圖者，傳奇言程嬰繪趙氏受難之經過及八義人之義行為圖，使趙氏觀之，令知其本末也。時趙武十五歲矣，孔武有力，見圖之後，始得復仇，崑曲常唱者有鬧朝，撲犬，救孤，觀畫等齣，即演此故事焉。二簧班中所演之「搜孤救孤」，蓋出於元代雜劇，元曲選有「趙氏孤兒」，演程嬰公孫杵臼救孤事，而二簧班乃自二人定計起，前無韓厥自刎，後無報仇，則更不完全之齣頭戲耳。不演全本，斷不可籠統名為八義圖，只可名為「搜孤救孤」而已。</p>
<p>今皮簧戲祇演「搜孤救孤」，誠以救孤情節最佳，極盡人情，而所用智謀又出於人情之外也。程妻不忍捨其襁褓之兒，杵臼暗示程嬰須出以勉强，比之「法塲換子」徐策一跪之下，徐氏便捨己子，為盡情矣，用計如連環，層出不窮，程嬰出首杵臼，一也；且親手鞭之，二也；孤兒令屠岸賈眼見搜出，（按史載屠岸賈旣殺趙朔趙括等，曾數入宮搜趙朔妻，朔妻，晋公女也，始分娩孤兒，朔妻祝天，命兒勿聲，有聲則趙氏絕知，屠搜甚久，兒無器聲乃免，屠仍搜之急，韓厥受屠之命守宮門，程嬰以藥箱携出孤兒，被韓搜出，程哭求甚哀，韓放之行，乃自刎死，今屠之搜，乃第三搜也。若排全本，三搜趙氏孤兒，更僥趣味，）使之不疑，三也；杵臼與假孤兒同死，令屠息心，四也；程嬰偕眞孤兒反投屠府長養，五也；五計皆出乎人情之外，故狠若屠賊，如坐鼓中而不覺也。</p>
<p>戲中程嬰乞求其妻捨子，至屈膝跪之，刀刃挾之，趣矣，然此乃戲劇上之組織也。按之史冊僅云：「公孫杵臼謬負他嬰，匿於山中，」蓋杵臼與俱死之假孤，乃不知誰氏之兒，非程嬰親子也，戲中謂即程氏子，好添出許多戲做，更見親切，更見出色，此最好之組織法，即謂為程氏親子可也。</p>
<p>此劇二簧亦有全本搜孤之後過十五年有觀畫，復仇等塲，譚派老生票友王雨田曾收百代鑽針唱片八義圖程嬰之二簧元板唱詞云：「隱藏孤兒在空山，到如今算來十五年，我心中只把奸賊怨，苦害趙家為那般，可嘆我公孫兄把命染，可嘆我年半百絕了兒男，老天爺若睜三分眼，仇報仇來冤報冤，」即報仇前之唱也。（王雨田嗓音哀思，宜唱二簧調，最似老譚，工力亦好，曾下海演戲，死於天津，年祇四十耳，）</p>
<h3>藝壇雜寫</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>大華大戲院定於上二日晚塲啟幕，獻映米蓋羅納，裘第珈倫的「金玉滿堂」，今天下午七時半在戲院招待各界，及試映新片。</p>
<p>大家知道上海的四家首輪西片院現在是完全是在亞洲影院管轄之下，所以逢到佳期節日，已不像過去那樣大家爭奇鬥勝，選映互相爭抗的巨片。現在大華大戲院崛起於後，並目奪得了每年出品最多的米高梅公司首映權，這樣大光明與南京的排片，勢必要有一番考慮了。（國泰以西人觀衆為多，大上海現在也無形之中降低了半級，所以是沒有問題的。）</p>
<p>一九三九的歲尾，話劇界繼「明末遺很」之後又下了一件大事。那便是「改良文明戲」的重整旗鼓，劇壇老將魏如晦於伶和周貽白等在顧夢鶴介紹下，加入綠寳劇塲編劇。自從譚志遠顧夢鶴白虹等最早提出「改良文明戲」的口號後，雖也遇到許多挫折，但在顧夢鶴的埋頭苦幹之下，一向給話劇界認為文明戲的錄寳居然建立了廣大觀衆的健全礎基。最近，有許多劇人覺悟了，爭取文明戲並不是墮落，尤其該教育太太奶奶們，應該打進腐爛的生活圈去，「我不入地獄，誰入地獄？」于伶周貽白等劇壇老將便親自出馬，這倒也很可以使一般「思想淺視病」患者作一個當頭棒喝。</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Finds It Extremely Difficult to Deal with Foreign Nationals - Talk by Tada</h3>
<p>Beiping: Lieutenant General Tada Hayao, commander of the Japanese garrison in Beiping, told reporters yesterday that "Japan is currently not worried about the redification of Northwest China; Japan's main problem is only dealing with China." Tada commented on foreigners' "suspicions that Japan intends to expel foreigners in China," and said, "We have never encountered such difficulties in dealing with foreigners in China as we do today during wartime. There is virtually no precedent in the history of the army." Tada asked foreigners to abandon their suspicions of Japan and told them to rest assured, saying that if Japan wanted to expel third-country people in China, Japan "will do it openly." Tada claimed that the British Concession in Tianjin "is no longer a base for anti-Japanese economic and political activities," but he stated that this cannot be interpreted as Japan will lift the blockade of the British and French concessions, "when the British and Japanese truly feel the need for cooperation and realize their mutual interests, the Tianjin issue can be fully resolved."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet-Finnish War and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War has taken the world by surprise, and everyone is paying close attention to it. International sentiment expresses deep sympathy for Finland and does not readily forgive the Soviet Union. Although the war has only been going on for ten days and Finland's resistance is extremely heroic, Finland's future is undeniably bleak, and the assistance from various countries is very slim. According to various sources, countries have already provided assistance to Finland separately; however, the spokesperson of the Finnish government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following lament: "The Finnish people are now asking, what will the world do for Finland? All parties have given sympathy, but what we need is not only sympathy. If no one comes to help Finland, how can this small country of three million people forever resist the Soviet Union of 180 million people? I am afraid that Finland will perish, with the same fate as Poland, or even worse. Therefore, lip service from various countries is of no help." From these few words, we can know the urgency of Finland's expectation of practical assistance. At present, the Finnish government has appealed this issue to the League of Nations, and the current League of Nations meeting will also take the Finnish issue as the theme of review; however, the League of Nations, such a ceremonial sacrificial organization, has always acted like Lao Tzu said "hesitating as if crossing a river in winter, as if fearing the neighbors"; this time regarding the Finnish issue, Finland has the right to appeal, and the League of Nations also has the obligation to accept the appeal; however, the facts show that the League of Nations' discussion of the Finnish issue, in addition to the so-called moral comfort, must still be limited.</p>
<p>The significance of helping Finland is not just to sanction the Soviet Union; and the reason why countries cannot actively help Finland is definitely not a lack of sympathy, but because sanctions against the Soviet Union are difficult to implement. Since the Soviet Union used troops against Finland, the opinions of various parties towards the Soviet Union are the same in condemnation, but differ in firmness. On the Soviet side, although it is publicized that it is aware of the existence of the world's anti-Soviet movement, it has no choice but to preemptively attack Finland; although this shows how the Soviet Union is worried about the international community, the international community will not accept this kind of propaganda, and will not recognize this kind of excuse, so it is not afraid of being suspected of brewing an anti-Soviet movement, and still gives Finland the greatest sympathy. Empty sympathy is not enough, small and sporadic assistance is not enough, and practical and effective assistance is currently impossible; therefore, the factual problem lies in whether the Finnish government itself can support the war situation. If it can support it for a long time, the assistance of various countries to Finland may become active; otherwise, it will inevitably encounter a tragic fate!</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Chinese government certainly has no need to explain its position, but the Chinese people have expressed infinite concern. Because if the Soviet Union has indeed expressed itself as an unlimited raider on the Finnish issue, will it "bury the fox and then dig it up," turning around and dismantling China's war of resistance? Or if the Soviet Union has something to do in the West, will it compromise with the invaders in the East for its own interests? These two points can be said to be common questions of every Chinese person after the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War. However, the expression of the facts, the above two points, may all be overthinking. The Soviet Union's friendship with China has always shown no signs of diminishing, and the recent completion of the Sino-Soviet airline within a week is just enough to symbolize the consolidation of friendship. As for the issue of Soviet-Japanese compromise, although Tokyo has repeatedly publicized it, but observing the fundamentals of Japan's national system and national thinking, it is not suitable to emulate Germany, what great changes are there. From the Soviet Union's point of view, when the Soviet Union advanced into Poland before, it had first concluded the Nomonhan truce agreement with Japan; this time, there was something to do in Finland, but there was no such prior action, and China and Finland are not in the same category, and East Asia and Northern Europe cannot be compared, so the Soviet Union, for the sake of its own future interests, will never sell friends to raise tigers. As for the position of an ordinary bystander, one cannot help but feel an almost intolerable emotional impulse from a sense of justice towards the Soviet-Finnish issue, but "resisting the war is the most important," "I am only concerned with myself," I only wish that the Soviet Union and Finland can eventually get a satisfactory solution; as for the League of Nations meeting, it may not be helpful to the solution of this problem!</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Ambushed in Changzi, Jin: Fierce Battle Lasts All Day, Over 200 Killed; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Begins Full-Scale General Offensive</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The war situation in the Shangdang area of Eastern Shanxi, which has been silent for a long time, has also ushered in a triumphant song after the recent victories in Southern Shanxi. The Chinese and Japanese forces in Changzi have been in a stalemate for a long time. On the evening of the 4th, a certain Chinese unit ambushed several troops on the north and south highlands of Shizhe Town in order to lure and attack the Japanese troops in Changzi. At the same time, a small number of troops launched an attack on the Japanese army via Nanhancun (west of Changzi). The Japanese army saw that the Chinese forces were weak and fell into the trap. On the afternoon of the 5th, 700-800 Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked Shizhe (west of Changzi). The Chinese ambushed troops took the opportunity to attack from both sides, and the Chinese troops facing the Japanese army counterattacked. After a fierce battle that lasted all day, over 200 Japanese troops were killed. The surviving Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and retreated along the original route. (Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: Since the 3rd of this month, the Japanese army has invaded Zhongtiao Mountain again in the war in Southern Shanxi. After suffering heavy losses from the separate attacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese army has been in a slump. The Chinese army took advantage of the exhaustion of the Japanese army and launched a full-scale general offensive, successively recovering the strongholds above and below Hengyu and actively sweeping away the Majiamiao (northeast of Xiaxian). In order to save the declining situation, the Japanese army has been reinforcing 3-4,000 troops in the past few days, stubbornly resisting. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese army launched a flank attack on the Japanese army from Qingshancun and northeast of Majiamiao, and directly launched an attack forward. After half a day of hand-to-hand combat, countless Japanese troops were killed. By noon, the line of the (1500) highland and the northeast highland of Majiamiao had been occupied. They are still in a fierce battle in the suburbs of Majiamiao. In addition, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Xiaxian disturbed the east from Shangjiaping, Yangjiayin (east of Xiaxian) and other places on the morning of the 8th, and fought with the Chinese army in the Daling area south of Hanjialing (west of Shangjiaping). The Chinese army is currently flanking the Japanese army attacking east of Xiaxian. (Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>Xingji: In the Ronghe area, 400-500 Japanese troops attempted to attack Yuwang Mountain. They were intercepted by the Chinese army, and the battle situation was quite fierce. Another unit raided the rear of the Japanese army, and the Japanese army was unable to withstand the assault and retreated in defeat. The Chinese army also moved to a certain place and encountered the reinforced Japanese army, and launched a bloody battle again. After holding on all day, the Japanese were finally defeated. (Telegram of the 8th)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese troops who invaded Zhongtiao Mountain have suffered heavy losses in recent days. The Japanese troops in Xinjiang, Hejin and other places are extremely panicked. Train tickets south of Houma have been suspended. (Telegram of the 7th)</p>

<h3>North Road慰勞团 Returns to Chongqing to Report</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The North Road Comfort Mission departed from Chongqing on June 28th, starting from 　樊 in the south, reaching Wuyuan in the north, Luoyang in the east, and Qinghai in the west, traveling 18,500 miles. They visited and comforted the military and civilians along the way with great effort. Wang Shiyu, the deputy head of the delegation, and the members Hu Xianglin, Chen Xixiang, Lao She, Zhang Xiluo, Xu 　Mo and others returned to Chongqing on the 9th to report. More than a hundred representatives of all sectors of the people welcomed them in the suburbs. When the delegation's special car arrived, music was played loudly and the welcomers rushed forward to shake hands and greet each other, and the atmosphere was very harmonious and enthusiastic. Although the representatives traveled thousands of miles, their spirits were extremely excited and they showed no signs of fatigue. (Telegram of the 9th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Elite Suffers Heavy Losses Attacking Mannerheim Line; Mechanical Units Ineffective in Lake and Marsh Terrain; Fierce Artillery Battles on the Northern Front Yesterday; Finnish Troops Maintain Strong Morale, Holding Original Positions</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: The battles on the border between the Soviet Union and Finland have caused the Soviet army to suffer major losses. According to a special correspondent from Denmark, the Soviet Kotiz unit, known for its fighting prowess, was annihilated in large numbers after mistakenly entering a Finnish machine gun position. In this war zone, almost the entire 24 hours of each day are in darkness, so the Finnish army can take advantage of its familiarity with the terrain to attack the Soviet army. (Haitong telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: It is generally expected here that the Soviet Union's decision to blockade the Finnish coast is a prelude to sending troops to land near Viipuri, with the aim of attacking from the rear to seize Finland's main defensive line, the "Mannerheim Line". People in Helsinki were not surprised by the news of the Soviet blockade, although normal shipping between Åbo and Stockholm will be suspended as a result, but Finland may still be able to control the Gulf of Bothnia. It was heard last night that Soviet troops attacking in the Karelian Isthmus have reached one of the four major defensive lines on the Mannerheim Line in several places. The Soviet offensive along the Voksi River in the northern part of the Isthmus was the most fierce last night. The Soviet army has a larger number of troops, so its advance is difficult to stop, but the Finnish staff said that the retreat of the Finnish army is slower than the Soviet Union expected. The Red Army is currently advancing in a vast area of pine forests, encountering many obstacles, because there are frozen rivers and countless small lakes crisscrossing it. There are no large land markers, and the snow is deep and the terrain is rugged, making it a natural trap for tanks everywhere. The Finnish army is now adopting guerrilla tactics, which can severely damage the enemy and reduce its own casualties. It is reported that the Finnish army is still holding the positions in Petsamo, where the Soviet army has recently increased significantly. It is rumored that Soviet aircraft bombed the Kolosjoki nickel mine yesterday. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Fierce battles broke out on the northern front early this morning. According to reliable sources, Soviet troops launched a surprise attack on a three-kilometer-long front line, but were ultimately repelled by the Finnish army. The accuracy of the Finnish artillery bombardment is better than that of the Red Army, which is recognized by all military experts. (Havas telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Yesterday, on the western side of Kainuu, the artillery battles between the Soviet and Finnish armies were exceptionally fierce. The Red Army is currently attacking the main defensive line of the Finnish army. The Red Army's advance is not only slow, but also greatly damaged because the retreating Finnish army buried landmines in the area through which they passed, and because of the fierce Finnish artillery fire. However, there are not many major battles in other parts of the front line. Finnish military leaders all believe that the Soviet army is currently waiting for the weather to clear up so that they can use aircraft to assist in the attack on the "Mannerheim Line". The wives of Finnish fishermen have always prayed for clear weather for their husbands and brothers every day, but now they mostly hope for dark and cloudy weather when they pray. In recent days, the weather has been as they wished, and the climate is bad, making it difficult for the air force to operate. The Red Army's attempt to cross the Tihuta River has been repelled by the Finnish army. (United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Military circles here are currently talking about the front-line battles, which have been skirmishes in recent days. In addition to the contact between patrols from both sides in the "no-man's zone" in front of the "Mannerheim Line", there has been no activity by artillery units. Several neutral military observers have recently returned here from the front line. According to them, the Finnish army clearly has the advantage in these contacts because it is familiar with the geography. Soviet patrols often get lost and are captured by the Finnish army. In addition, the Finnish army has strong morale and all its ordnance and equipment are extremely sophisticated. According to various sources, the Red Army has repeatedly resolved to advance, and civilians are in the forefront. These people are mostly political prisoners captured by the Soviet Union in the Polish occupied area. (Havas telegram of the 8th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet Red Army entered the Namua area yesterday, and all circles believe that this is an attempt by the Red Army to encircle Finland's Mannerheim Line. Soviet reinforcements have now concentrated in southeastern Finland, advancing towards the southeastern front of Karelia and the eastern border of Finland. According to military observers, the Red Army is now using a strategy similar to that used by the German army to attack Poland, in an attempt to break through Finland's resistance. However, the adverse climate and the stubborn resistance of the Finnish army have thwarted the Soviet plan. (United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Finnish Representative Applies to League of Nations to Handle Soviet-Finnish Dispute; League of Nations Council Holds Secret Meeting Yesterday; Sino-Japanese Issue Not on Agenda</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Finnish representative to the League of Nations, Holsti, formally submitted an application today based on Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. It is heard that the League of Nations Secretariat has stepped up the process of handling the Soviet-Finnish dispute. It is worth noting that the League of Nations must have a unanimous vote of the Administrative Council before it can expel a member. However, given the current organization, it is almost impossible to obtain unanimous agreement. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations Administrative Council, which was scheduled to hold an open meeting today, has been postponed because Finnish representative Holsti has not yet prepared a detailed statement opposing the Soviet Union. It is expected to meet on Monday next week, allowing Holsti to consult with delegations from various countries at ease. The Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting at noon today to discuss the agenda, and will continue the meeting this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The 100-odd regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting this morning, chaired by Belgian representative Gaton de Vieira. The Soviet Union did not send a representative to the meeting. After the Administrative Council passed the agenda, Chinese representative Gu Weijun immediately declared that the application submitted by China regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict has been included in the agenda of previous meetings of the Administrative Council. Although this session may be an exception and not submitted for discussion, I will still issue a statement on this application when the Administrative Council holds an open meeting. The Administrative Council then decided to continue the meeting at 5 pm today to discuss the Finnish issue. (Havas telegram of the 9th)</p>

<h3>Britain Unwilling to Offend the Soviet Union, Plans Only to Condemn Perfunctorily</h3>
<p>The Argentine government in London had previously telegraphed the League of Nations, requesting a declaration expelling the Soviet Union from the League. However, the Soviet embassy there suddenly released a communique today, implying that if the League of Nations intends to impose sanctions on the Soviet Union or declare the country expelled from the League, many neutral countries in Europe may find it inconvenient to vote. It also stated that when the staff of the Finnish embassy in the Soviet Union departed from Moscow to return home, the envoys of Germany and Italy, as well as Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, did not send personnel to see them off according to usual diplomatic etiquette, which is noteworthy. Diplomatic circles here attach great importance to this communique and unanimously praise it, believing that Argentina's attitude has become more moderate and that it no longer insists that the League of Nations Administrative Council declare the Soviet Union expelled from the League. This coincides with the views held by most important British figures. In other words, on the one hand, they are severely condemning the Soviet Union's acts of aggression, and on the other hand, they are considering the consequences that the League of Nations' actions against the Soviet Union may cause. Informed sources also say that the essence of Britain's current policy consists of no more than three points: (1) There is absolutely no justification for the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland, and it should be condemned. (2) Within possible limits, Finland should be supplied with as much military equipment and other goods as possible, but the quantity cannot be too large in reality. (3) Britain is willing to cooperate with other countries that sympathize with Finland to actively assist Finland. The above three measures are more practical than other actions that the League of Nations can take. If the League of Nations takes action, it will not only fail to strike the Soviet Union, but will also make the collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union even closer. However, if any member of the League of Nations makes various proposals, even including proposals to implement sanctions or declare the Soviet Union expelled from the League, Britain, as a member state, is willing to study them. In the future, Britain is also willing to abide by any resolutions that are approved by the majority of member states. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Netherlands Has No Intention of Contending for a Council Seat</h3>
<p>The Hague Today, the Government Information Office announced that the Dutch government has decided not to accept the candidate status for the vacancy in the League of Nations Administrative Council, believing that it is possible for both the Netherlands and Belgium to attend, but the fact that the Scandinavian countries do not occupy a seat is unhelpful. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva Excluding Italy, a Council member, (which declared its withdrawal from the League on December 11, 1937), there are a total of fourteen countries in the Administrative Council. Among them, only Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are permanent members. Among the other non-permanent and quasi-permanent members, five countries have either completed their terms, been re-elected, or been succeeded by other countries, which has yet to be determined. What is known is that the seat occupied by New Zealand will be succeeded by another dominion of the British Empire, and the seat occupied by Bolivia will be succeeded by another Latin American country, or perhaps by Argentina.

<h3>Soviet Union Declares War on Finland Without Declaration, Blockade is Clearly Illegal, US Interests If Damaged, Declaration Should Be the Responsibility of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Oslo The Soviet government has recently notified the Norwegian Navy that the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia will be blockaded by the Soviet Union from this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Helsinki After the Soviet government implemented a blockade of the Finnish coast, local officials here declared that since the country insists that it is not at war with our country, its blockade of our coast is naturally an illegal act. Even in terms of a "peacetime blockade," it is necessary for the blockaded party to have indeed violated the League of Nations Covenant before it can be implemented, and it must be participated in by all civilized countries. Since our country has no such situation, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's actions have absolutely no legal basis. In addition, the waters around the Åland Islands have been mined by our country, and Soviet warships cannot enter the Gulf of Bothnia, so the blockade has little practical effect. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Helsinki The German embassy in Finland yesterday requested that all German ships anchored in Finnish ports leave their original ports before noon today. This notice implies that the Soviet Union will soon impose a blockade on the Finnish coast, but the Finnish government declares that Finland is not afraid of the Russian blockade, because the Russian naval power is not sufficient to make the blockade effective.

<h3>United States Declares to Britain Maintenance of International Law Integrity, Also Sent Note to Britain Regarding the Confiscation of German Goods, US Merchant Ship Navigation Plan Under Study</h3>
<p>London The American Chargé d'Affaires in Britain met with Foreign Office officials this afternoon and presented a note, declaring a reservation of all rights regarding Britain's blockade of German export trade. The British government will submit a reply after careful study. (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington The United States has notified Britain that it is reserving its rights under international law due to the Allies' decision to confiscate German exports carried by neutral ships. The original text was published here today, stating that the tendency to disregard international law is threatening the security of peace-loving countries, and at this time, we must strive to uphold the integrity of international law. If Britain's order to confiscate German exports is implemented, American ships carrying goods produced or owned by Germany will be taken to British ports, regardless of the place of loading or unloading, and regardless of the ownership of the goods when the ship is intercepted. According to American legislation, American ships have been prohibited from operating in certain areas on the west coast of Europe, so the situation of interfering with American ships on the grounds of breaking the blockade should not occur. A belligerent country's plan for another belligerent country should not be appropriately extended to expand the belligerent country's rights over neutral ships, or to the extent that it hinders the legitimate trade of neutral countries. The United States cannot ignore the plans to be adopted by the British Order in Council, and if it is implemented, it will increase the many obstacles and damages that international trade is currently encountering. Diplomatic circles here, in view of the current political situation in the United States and the accusations of isolationists against the government's actions, believe that the wording of this American document could not be more moderate, but they also feel that the US government has failed to use harsher wording, because the United States has not protested against Germany's laying of mines or detaining ships. (Reuters dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington After meeting with US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy yesterday, President Roosevelt stated at a reception for reporters that the government is currently studying a plan for the navigation of US merchant ships, so that US ships can sail outside the war zone, carrying goods currently carried by ships from the warring countries. The President also said that he would meet with Kennedy yesterday afternoon to discuss world affairs. The President has discussed with Kennedy a plan to restore the southern pine trade, which has been stalled due to the European blockade. Kennedy stated at a reception for reporters yesterday, "The United States will never participate in the European war." When a reporter asked if the Allies hoped for US assistance, Kennedy replied, "No one in the world loves war. If the United States adheres to neutrality, they cannot force it." (United Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>London Regarding Britain's blockade of German export trade, the US government has submitted a note declaring reservation of rights. British political and public opinion circles originally believed that Germany's submarine and mine warfare posed a major threat to international trade and the lives and property of the people of various neutral countries. Britain had no choice but to take legitimate self-defense measures. In view of the situation, the United States would not, after other neutral countries, make accusations against Britain. Now it is beyond expectations, and after being surprised, I feel quite depressed. Political figures also said that this issue is a matter of life and death in Britain. If it does not want to risk defeat or allow the war to drag on for a long time, it is inconvenient to sit idly by while Germany uses all means to fight, without trying to deal with it. For the benefit of various neutral countries, the two allied countries, Britain and France, must win before they can obtain protection. In short, this matter is a comparison between Sweden's blockade policy and the blockade policies of Britain and France. All neutral countries will be able to choose which side they want to win. Now that the United States has submitted a note, the British government should naturally provide an answer in law and try to reduce inconvenience in practice. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>New York, Regarding the blockade of German export trade by Britain and France, after the US government submitted a note to Britain yesterday, reserving its rights, the New York Times commented, "The position of the United States has been explained by this note. In other words, the United States, as the most powerful neutral country, has always regarded maintaining international law as its main interest, but it also sympathizes with the efforts of Britain and France to curb German aggression. This is why the word 'protest' was not used in this note. It is hoped that Britain will do its best to ensure that the needs of the country and the interests of the United States do not run counter to each other. (Havas dispatch of the 9th)</p>

Germany will permanently control the area of the North Sea from the German coast to the Shetland Islands, 900 kilometers long and 450 to 100 kilometers wide, which has been controlled by the "elite troops" of the German Air Force. Germany has used the air hegemony of the North Sea to control the navigation of various ships. (Haitong dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<h3>Italy Adopts a Wait-and-See Policy on the European Situation, Especially Emphasizing Balkan Security; German-Italian Alliance Remains Unwavering; Ciano to Clarify Stance Next Saturday</h3>
<p>Rome – The "Italian Daily" published an article by Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaida, stating that the Italian state of "non-belligerence" mentioned in the Fascist Grand Council's communiqué differs from neutrality. Any involvement in the Balkan countries involves Italy's interests, which is why Italy pays special attention to developments in the Balkans. The communiqué reflects Italy's reserved attitude and confirms the steadfastness and continuation of Italian policy. German-Italian relations remain unchanged as stipulated in their alliance. It is expected that Foreign Minister Ciano will speak in parliament next week to elaborate on Italy's stance. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome – Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Fascist Corporations Council on the 16th of this month, explaining Italy's current policy. According to reports, the Foreign Minister will present a clear and comprehensive report on Italy's policy at that time. Furthermore, various newspapers have commented on the communiqué issued by the Fascist Grand Council yesterday, stating that Italy attaches the utmost importance to maintaining the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region. The "Messenger" newspaper also stated, "Our country's policy towards the Balkan Peninsula is based on geography, history, economics, and even the European balance of power. In short, the Balkan Peninsula should belong to the Balkan nations." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris – The communiqué issued by the Italian Fascist Grand Council yesterday has been commented on by the local morning newspapers, which generally believe that Italy's primary consideration of its own interests is its right and cannot be opposed by anyone. The country's current attitude remains ambiguous, but in fact, considering the course of this war, it is expected that the country would adopt such an attitude. The right-wing "Petit Parisien" newspaper stated, "No one is currently attempting to break the German-Italian axis. If this axis were to break one day, it would be Germany that did it. In other words, it would be because Germany wanted to threaten, destroy, or encompass everything, which has nothing to do with us." The moderate "L'Ordre" newspaper stated that Germany and Italy had once signed a secret agreement stipulating that if one signatory country went to war, the other must provide assistance in the army, navy, and air force. However, if Germany went to war before 1942, the year of the opening of the Rome International Exposition, Italy could temporarily not participate in the war. Foreign Minister Ciano visited Adolf Hitler in Germany on October 8th of this year to declare the country's decision to invoke this reservation clause and avoid joining the war, thus showing that Italy is not refusing to fulfill its obligations under the political and military agreement. In short, Italy's current policy is clearly a wait-and-see policy. The fact that the Fascist Grand Council's communiqué yesterday did not mention the Finnish incident is clear evidence of this.

<h3>Uruguay Decides to Withdraw from the League</h3>
<p>Uruguay’s Capital – The Uruguayan Senate, by a vote of 22 to 4, decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. Newspapers prominently featured speeches by senators criticizing the League, believing it had completely failed to guarantee peace and security. Foreign Minister Juan expressed strong opposition to the withdrawal and had attempted to prevent the Senate vote, arguing that a decision should be made after the League of Nations convenes and the attitudes of the various countries are known. Political figures therefore believe that the Senate's decision to withdraw is a failure of the government. Uruguay's note to the League of Nations aimed to expel the Soviet Union from the League, not for Uruguay itself to withdraw. (Haitong, 9th)</p>

<h3>Philippine Hopes to Postpone Independence Deadline; President Quezon to Visit the U.S. Next Summer</h3>
<p>Hong Kong International News Agency, Washington, 8th – According to information obtained by this agency, Philippine President Quezon plans to visit the United States next June to urge the U.S. to extend the date for the complete independence of the Philippines beyond the scheduled year of 1946. It is understood that Quezon intends to request the government to amend the Philippine Independence Act, so that the Philippines will not be absolutely independent de jure, but can obtain the status of a self-governing dominion de facto. Official sources say that from the U.S. government's point of view, the Philippine issue is still open to discussion, as the government has always regarded the Philippines as a major key to the U.S. maintaining its position in the Far East. According to reliable sources, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre has fully informed President Quezon of this intention, and has also told him that the issue of extending Philippine independence should be initiated by the Philippine side first. It is understood that Quezon's trip next year is due to the Philippine people's desire to maintain ties with the U.S., and because of the European and Asian situation, they hope to rely on U.S. military strength for protection. Official sources say that Japan's new policy aims to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible and has proposed a non-aggression pact to the Soviet Union, which is causing great panic in the Philippines. Once the Japanese troops in China can be redeployed, the Philippines, located in a key position between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, which Japan covets, may be subject to the possibility of Japan using force to implement annexation. Official sources say that Philippine strategists, in order to ensure national security, seem to be prepared to implement the proposal to extend independence. According to sources in Washington, the Philippines, in view of Germany's annexation of Poland with lightning speed, is deeply concerned that if Japan launches a southward advance policy, it may also quickly annex the Philippines. It has also been learned that the Japanese Navy has conducted exercises twice this year off the east coast of New Guinea. (8th)</p>
<p>Manila – According to news from here today, U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre is currently conducting a broad inspection of the Philippines. His automobile has traveled through more than three provinces, meeting with local leaders everywhere and inspecting indigenous troops. It is reported that Sayre will go to the Japanese area of the Philippines, Davao Province, tomorrow. After arriving there, Sayre plans to inspect the Japanese hemp cultivation industry and the Japanese way of life. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Reassigns Flag Officers</h3>
<p>Washington – According to an announcement by the Navy Department, Admiral Bloch, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, is scheduled to be reassigned to the position of Commander of the Fourteenth Naval District, Pearl Harbor, Hawaiian Islands, on January 6th next year. The vacancy will be filled by Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the Battle Fleet, and Rear Admiral Snyder will succeed him as Commander of the Battle Fleet. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Landon Discuss Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Washington – Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in 1936, held a formal meeting with President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday to discuss U.S. foreign policy. Some people regard this meeting as having great significance, as it is generally recalled that Landon has repeatedly supported Roosevelt whenever the government has taken major actions on foreign policy. It is also generally recalled that some Republican senators regard President Roosevelt's recognition of the Soviet Union as a major political issue, and the meeting may be related to President Roosevelt's refusal to recall the U.S. ambassador to Moscow or to meet with the two. When Landon left the White House, he claimed that he and the President only discussed foreign policy and that the conversation was "informal." He did not mention the message he sent on Thursday requesting President Roosevelt to announce whether he intended to run for a third term. (United Press, 9th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Mongolian-Japanese-“Manchukuo” Boundary Demarcation Conference Held in Chita</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet-Mongolian-Japanese-“Manchukuo” Mixed Commission, established in accordance with the Molotov-Togo Agreement for the purpose of demarcating the boundaries of the recent conflict zone between the Mongolian People's Republic and “Manchukuo,” was convened on December 7 in the Chita region under the chairmanship of Brigade Commander Podenov, representative of the Soviet government. After exchanging greetings and documentary evidence, it has begun to discuss formal working procedures. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Improve Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Although there is much discussion about Japan's intention to negotiate a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, the general opinion here is that this is not entirely impossible, but it must wait until (1) some pending issues such as the rights of Japanese people in Northern Sakhalin and Japanese fishing issues are resolved, and (2) the Japanese-Soviet trade negotiations are established before negotiations can proceed. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated in its editorial today that the date for the formal opening of the trade negotiations has been tentatively set for mid-January next year. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo is currently having frank talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in the hope of facilitating the trade negotiations and obtaining a political solution to Japanese-Soviet relations. The Japanese government's commencement of trade negotiations with the Soviet Union before the Japanese-American trade negotiations are abolished clearly has deep meaning. Will Japan actively use the policy of controlling one country with another? (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Meets with National Representatives</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to today's "Yomiuri Shimbun," Prime Minister Abe will meet with sixteen leaders of the "Spiritual Mobilization" to hear their reports on the public's reaction to government policies and to learn what measures they want the authorities to take. Among these sixteen people is Hatta, the former Minister of Commerce and Industry, who went to several districts from September to November to listen to the opinions of rural leaders. He learned that the people are now unanimously demanding the elimination of social ills, the cessation of the habit of exchanging gifts, and striving for simple clothing. On the last point, the people feel that government officials and the rich should set an example. Regarding government policies, the people demand a unified approach to the continued war in China and the situation around the world. Of the nine counties he visited, the people wanted the government to clarify its foreign policy so that the public would not be confused. As for the people's emotions towards the countries concerned, they varied greatly, with some advocating friendship with the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and others opposing it.

<h3>Two Instances of Valor by French Air Force Personnel</h3>
<p>Paris – A Havas correspondent who witnessed the heroic actions of French air force personnel on the Eastern Front has selected the two most admirable and decisive achievements and described them as follows: According to reports, four air force personnel, including one reconnaissance officer, one pilot, and two machine gunners, recently boarded a large reconnaissance plane and went to reconnoiter the enemy. As soon as they arrived over the enemy's position, they were confronted by six Messerschmitt fighter planes. A fierce battle immediately broke out between the two sides. The French machine gunners calmly responded and at one point repelled the enemy planes, but soon the enemy planes returned and fired intensively at the reconnaissance plane with machine guns. The fuselage and wings were riddled with bullets. Finally, the enemy used incendiary bombs and hit the plane's left engine, which immediately caught fire. The plane suddenly descended from a height of 6,000 meters to 2,000 meters. At that time, the reconnaissance officer and one of the machine gunners had already been shot and killed. The other machine gunner was ordered by the pilot to jump with a parachute, but according to various reports, this person also failed to land safely. The pilot himself was injured, but he still flew the plane back to French territory. The plane finally landed not far from the front line, and the pilot died. According to the French Air Force authorities, the photos and other documents taken by the plane did not fall into the hands of the enemy. This is all due to the pilot's loyalty and dedication. In addition, another reconnaissance plane, after taking many photos, was surrounded by a squadron of enemy planes. The reconnaissance plane ascended and hid in the clouds, and fired at the enemy planes with machine guns. It then hurriedly flew back to its base, but the enemy planes closely pursued, firing intensively at it along the way. The reconnaissance plane's two machine gunners were both seriously injured and the machine guns were also damaged, so that it had no ability to fight back. At that time, the situation was already bordering on despair, but the pilot's improvisation allowed him to safely return to the base. However, all personnel were injured when they got off the plane and were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. The heroic situation can be seen. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>"Sao Dang Bao" Warns the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing's "Sao Dang Bao" today commented on the losses suffered by Americans since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War due to Japanese bombing. The newspaper continued, saying that 50% to 60% of the losses suffered by American people and property in China at the hands of the Japanese were caused by weapons that the United States supplied to Japan. Now, Nomura is once again using sweet words with Grew, saying that Japan does not want to harm American rights and interests, but in fact, American lives and property are not guaranteed at all. Nomura's claim that Japan can guarantee that such incidents will not happen again is an empty check, because the Japanese government has never been able to keep its word, and even if the government hopes to keep its word, its soldiers in China will definitely not put the government in their eyes. In short, Nomura will definitely have no control over the military, so Grew and the American authorities should definitely not be deceived by what Nomura says. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing today issued a statement describing the bombing of American industries in China by Japanese aircraft. It is said that since the outbreak of war between China and Japan over the Lugouqiao Incident and up to September of this year, a total of 36 American churches and schools have been bombed, resulting in 24 deaths and 25 injuries. (It is believed that this number includes both Americans and Chinese.) American properties destroyed by Japanese bombers also include the gunboat Panay and one aircraft of the China National Aviation Corporation, namely the Guilin. According to estimates by the Chinese official news agency, American properties have been bombed by Japanese aircraft a total of 150 times. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>National Government Orders Praise for Wu Peifu</h3>
<p>Chongqing National Government Order of the 9th: (1) Wu Peifu is to be posthumously awarded the rank of General of the First Class of the Army. This order, (2) The late Army General Wu Peifu was upright in character and steadfast in his aspirations. In the past, he reorganized the army and achieved remarkable fame. He hated evil and expelled the wicked, maintained righteousness and was incorruptible, which was beneficial to the world and people's hearts. Since the Mukden Incident, he has been concerned about national difficulties and has always encouraged himself with utmost loyalty. After the fall of Peiping, his situation became more difficult, but he was able to maintain his position from beginning to end, adding glory to the country and nation. His heroic demeanor and noble character were admired by both Chinese and foreigners. It was hoped that he would enjoy a long life and be a model for others. However, he passed away due to a minor illness, and in memory of his loyalty and righteousness, we express our deepest sorrow. He should be publicly praised, and the Military Affairs Commission should deliberate on generous condolences. A special funeral fee of 10,000 yuan is granted. His life story should be recorded and sent to the Historical Archives to show the state's concern for virtuous and upright people and to encourage utmost loyalty and righteousness. This order.</p>
<p>After the death of General Wu Peifu, the Chinese newspapers under Japanese control in Peiping expressed great praise for Wu, and the Japanese military spokesman also spoke to express his admiration, calling Wu the most capable and upright figure among Chinese soldiers, and saying that Wu's death was a great loss to Japan. He also said that Wu had expressed his willingness to assist the Japanese before his death, but the spokesman could not say to whom Wu had made this statement. Currently, Qi Xieyuan, Wang Yitang, Chen Zhongfu, and others are preparing for funeral affairs. The Peiping authorities have ordered all agencies to fly flags at half-mast on the third day of Wu's death and plan to hold a meeting to discuss the funeral ceremony. Wu's family has received numerous condolence telegrams and letters. Japanese dignitaries such as Konoe have also sent telegrams of condolence. Wu's coffin is temporarily placed in his residence in Dongcheng and is scheduled to be buried on the seventh day. It will be moved to Changchun Temple, and after the arrangements are completed, it will be buried in Penglai, Shandong Province. (9th)</p>
<p>Although the Japanese military in Peiping has released He Yingqin's condolence telegram to Wu Peifu's family to the press, Wu's family has not received this telegram. According to Chinese reports, Jin Yunpeng, the former Premier of the Anfu Clique, arrived in Peiping from Tianjin today. The Japanese military may give Jin the position previously given to Wu Peifu.

<h3>The Concession Authorities Set a Rice Price Limit, Strictly Enforced Starting Today, with the Highest Grade White Rice at Forty-Five Yuan Per Shi, and Xian Rice Priced at Thirty-Eight Yuan Per Shi; Violators Will Be Reported to the Public Works Department for Punishment</h3>
<p>The concession authorities of both concessions are quite concerned about the entire rice market in Shanghai. Given the rising rice prices, which are greatly related to the security within the concessions, it is heard that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession is preparing legal sanctions. Mr. Hoteck Quy, the Deputy General Manager of the department, specifically telegraphed Mr. Fu Qian Geng, the Director of the Rice Shop Tea Association Market Management Committee, and Mr. Zhang Nian Xuan, the Chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, at 2:00 PM yesterday. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhang rushed to the department to meet with Mr. Hoteck. Mr. Fu and Mr. Zhang separately reported on the recent situation of the rice market, the source of rice, the chaotic situation of the market, and the strict supervision of the transactions of fellow traders in the market. Mr. Hoteck immediately discussed the selling price of rice: (1) the highest price for white rice should be forty-five yuan per shi (one market shi is 160 catties), and (2) the price for Xian rice should be thirty-eight yuan per shi, and no one should take advantage of the situation to raise prices, in order to maintain the entire rice market within the concessions. Anyone exceeding this price limit will be reported to the authorities for severe punishment.</p>
<p>Soybean and Rice Association Holds Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>In addition to instructing the Rice Shop Association Market Management Committee to take strict measures to ban illegal cross-level transactions in the market, the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association also convened the 57th joint meeting of the 3rd Executive and Supervisory Committee at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange on the second floor of 15 Avenue Edward VII. Seventeen committee members attended, including Xing Zhi Gang, Chen Zi Yi, Zhu Zi Xiang, She Bing Wen, Jin Zhao Yun, Hu Wen An, Cha Sheng Ming, Fu Qian Geng, Yin Fu Xiang, Xu Ye Sun, Zhou Zhi Zhen, Gu Yi Sheng, Zhang Nian Xuan, Zhu Xiang Sheng, Jiang Hong Bin, Yan Xiao Quan, and Zhang Li Zhong. Xing Zhi Gang, the chairman, first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Fu Qian Geng reporting on his meeting with the authorities and the chaotic situation of the rice market. Chen Zi Yi then contributed his opinions on comprehensive solutions. The discussion then began and concluded at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Planning for Comprehensive Solutions</p>
<p>One motion was discussed yesterday: The recent increase in rice prices is causing hardship for the common people and affecting local security. How should we find ways to remedy this situation and achieve balance? Upon investigation, the recent increase in rice prices is a cause for concern. We should find ways to remedy this situation and achieve balance. The association, recognizing the importance of this matter, convened a meeting for serious discussion and believes that there are three short-term solutions: (1) Accept the Public Works Department's intention to temporarily set the price of high-grade white rice at no more than forty-five yuan per shi, and foreign rice and Ke Xian rice at no more than thirty-eight yuan per shi, with Du Xian and Yang Xian rice excluded from this rule. This will be announced and implemented from the 10th of this month, and the Management Committee will strictly enforce it. Violators will be reported to the concession authorities for punishment. (2) The agreement reached in the rice market yesterday to set a three-day deadline for the delivery of domestic rice is a good policy and should be ratified, but it should be supplemented to ensure that all domestic rice, Xian rice, and foreign rice are delivered within three days of the transaction. Violators should be severely punished. (3) Please report any unscrupulous merchants who are manipulating the market and hoarding goods as much as possible. The association will forward the reports to the concession authorities for severe punishment. There are also three long-term solutions: (1) From yesterday onwards, all rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains transported to the port by train should not be allowed to be transported to the concessions. We should immediately write to the concession authorities to find a way to dredge the canal to alleviate the urgent need. Also, the price of Wuhu rice is only a little over fifteen yuan at most. We should immediately write to the concession authorities to find a way to obtain 50,000 bags of Wuhu Xian rice export permits for merchants to use, thereby increasing the source. The price can be set by the concession authorities according to the cost. (2) It is suggested that the concession authorities, the Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Qia Qing convene a meeting of various public organizations to discuss group purchases of foreign rice to increase strength and add sources. Please also ask the Chamber of Commerce to inform the banking industry to provide loans as much as possible to those who purchase domestic or foreign rice. (3) Please ask the Chamber of Commerce and Yu Qia Qing to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance, following the previous example, to apply for legal foreign exchange, at least to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice to be used for price stabilization and to help the poor.</p>

<p>Yu Qia Qing had previously initiated a group purchase of Saigon foreign rice, entrusted to the Accountants Association for registration, and this association, together with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and other organizations, organized the first price stabilization effort. Although it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem, many people went to buy miscellaneous goods. This time, the source of rice has not been interrupted, but the price of rice has continued to rise, breaking the new record of forty-eight yuan. The Soybean and Rice Trade Association, recognizing this, had Zhang Nian Xuan contact Yu Qia Qing to discuss a second Saigon rice price stabilization effort. Recognizing the importance of this matter, it was determined that it could not be achieved in the short term. Currently, all parties are actively negotiating, and once everything is in order, it will be categorized and processed step by step.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Saigon Rice Traded Continuously</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from various rice industry organizations in the city that Shun Feng Rice Trading Firm in the city had successively commissioned the French Da Fu Foreign Firm, the British He Yi Foreign Firm, the Swedish Fu Jia Foreign Firm, and the Jian Yuan Hua Firm to order Saigon foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for regulation, totaling 330,000 bags agreed by telegram. One-third of them, or 110,000 bags, have been transported to Shanghai. It is learned that the Qin Lai Ma Le, Suzhou, Chongqing, Qin Lai Bao Tuo, and other ships left Saigon for Shanghai on the 28th of last month and the 7th and 8th of this month, all loaded with large quantities of Saigon rice, and will arrive in port within a few days. The Saigon rice transported by the Nan Ning ship was unloaded by 3:00 PM yesterday. It is reported that yesterday, another telegram was sent to the Swedish Fu Jia Foreign Firm to trade 5 tons of No. 2 Saigon rice, weighing 198 catties per bag, and another 5 tons of broken rice.</p>
<p>Market Management Committee Issues Public Notice This Morning</p>

The notice was issued to the market and sent to more than one hundred firms yesterday morning. It is learned that the committee has scheduled its 56th committee meeting at the public sampling office in the market at 10:00 AM this morning. At that time, the price limits of forty-five yuan for the highest grade white rice and thirty-eight yuan for foreign rice and Ke Xian rice will be reported, and all rice trading firms will be strongly urged to comply, in order to stabilize the entire rice market. The Soybean and Rice Trade Association decided to issue a public notice to the market this morning to implement it.</p>

<h3>Christmas Economy Campaign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA Industrial Department, considering the cold weather and the special circumstances in the Nanshi area, where many refugees are homeless and without adequate clothing, appealed to various circles to raise funds for winter clothing. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations from Chinese and foreign philanthropists, the results have been remarkable. However, the number of refugees in the area is large, and the amount of winter clothing raised is still insufficient to meet the needs. Many are still thinly clad and unable to withstand the cold. Efforts to raise funds for winter clothing are still being promoted in many ways. In view of the imminent arrival of Christmas, a campaign to save money and aid the needy has been launched. The purpose is to save money on Christmas celebrations to fund the purchase of winter clothing. The campaign is currently underway to benefit the refugees. The office is located at Room 308, 113 Jiujiang Road, telephone number 16082.</p>

<p>Between the 7th and 8th, a large number of troops from Taiwan and Manchukuo, totaling more than nine thousand, suddenly arrived in the Nanshi area.

The troops were transferred from Wuhu, with disorganized uniforms and lacking winter clothing. At 8:00 PM on the night of the 7th, three soldiers from the puppet Manchukuo army broke into a civilian house near the puppet police station outside the Dananmen gate in Nanshi, searching for winter quilts. When the elderly occupant refused, they were enraged and stabbed him to death with a bayonet. After the arrival of these troops, the residents of Nanshi were terrified, fearing for their safety and discussing ways to protect themselves. Young men and women were particularly alarmed. It is also learned that the Shangchuan Guild Hall in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, and several newly built Western-style civilian houses at the former site of the police headquarters on Xundao Street inside Dadongmen are spacious and were not destroyed in the war. They have now been furnished with low beds and are prepared to house large numbers of Japanese troops who are being transferred to Shanghai. It is said that the total number of Japanese troops being transferred to Shanghai is in the tens of thousands and that they will all arrive by the 15th of this month.

Yesterday, applications from major factories, businesses, and various trade associations were reviewed, and applicants were notified to collect the fractional currency notes.

It is confirmed that one-yuan notes have been transported from Hong Kong</p>
<p>A large number of new notes have been exchanged by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, so the panic over one-yuan notes is no longer a problem. Regarding one-jiao and two-jiao fractional currency notes, after the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Industries Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to promptly increase printing and transport them to Shanghai for relief, they are still awaiting a reply from the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Chinese Insurance Industry Adjusts Fire Insurance</h3>
<p>Adopting Gross and Net Prices, To Be Implemented Within Half a Year</p>

The Shanghai Insurance Trade Association, recognizing this, has resolved to change it to net prices, to be implemented within six months. Before the net price method is implemented, the discount rate will be slightly adjusted from today to ensure that the entire Chinese insurance industry can move forward in unison. Yesterday, a notice was sent to all Chinese and foreign insurance companies in the city, stating that from the 9th of October this year, all member companies of the association that underwrite various fire insurance policies for Chinese-owned properties in the city must adhere to a minimum discount rate of 18% of the price set by the association and may not give any other discounts or rebates. This notice is hereby given.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Japanese Military Police Assaulting Westerners Not Yet Resolved, Japanese Media's Claim of Reconciliation Is Unilateral, Must Await Return of US Reporter to Shanghai for Processing</h3>
<p>At approximately 10:30 AM on the 6th, a plainclothes member of the Japanese Marine Military Police invaded a US Navy barge anchored at Public Wharf No. 4 on the Bund, questioned what was being loaded, and assaulted Russel, an employee of the US Navy Purchasing Office. Lieutenant Commander Fox, the director of the Purchasing Office, prepared a report</p>
<p>Submitted the report</p>
<p>Presented to Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze Patrol Fleet. The Rear Admiral had left for Wuhu by ship on the 7th on official business and must wait until he returns to Shanghai to take action. This was reported by a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency on the 8th. The Japanese side, realizing that they were in the wrong, sent Major Hayashi of the Marine Military Police to visit US Acting Consul General Lockhart to formally</p>
<p>Expressed an apology</p>
<p>That evening, a Japanese Navy spokesperson stated at a press briefing that the case had been reconciled because Major Hayashi had visited the US Consul General and that the case was due to a misunderstanding between the two sides. When a reporter visited the US Consulate yesterday, it was learned that the Japanese side's belief that a "reconciliation" had been reached was a unilateral hope. The US Consulate stated that the handling of the case would be entirely up to Rear Admiral Glassford to decide. Although the Japanese side had expressed its apology to the US Consul, the US side has not considered the case to be "reconciled."</p>

<h3>Ma Xiangbo's 57th Day Anniversary Yesterday, Relatives and Friends Held a Grand Mass, Presided over by Bishop Zhu Kaimin of Haimen District, the Ceremony Was Solemn and Grand, and a Commemorative Photo Was Taken</h3>
<p>After the death of the centenarian Ma Xiangbo, the "57th day" anniversary was held the day before yesterday (8th). Zhu Kaimin, Bishop of Haimen District and Ma's nephew, came to Shanghai from Haimen a few days ago and decided to hold a memorial mass on the day of the "57th day" anniversary. However, since the 8th was a Catholic holiday, the memorial ceremony could not be held, so it was postponed to 7:15 AM yesterday at St. Peter's Church on Lyuban Road. Those who participated yesterday were all</p>
<p>Ma's relatives and friends, including Zhu Kaimin, his brother Zhu Zhi Yao, his younger brother Zhu Ji Lin, his nephew Zhu Si Man, Zhu Lu Yi, and about 30 members of the Zhu family, Ma's old friends Xu Wei Hui, He Li Zhong, Pu Ji Ting, and Lu De, president of the Hankou Catholic Action Association, and Ma's great-grandson Zhang Chongren also participated yesterday. A memorial platform was set up in the hall, with white candles lit around it. At 7:15</p>
<p>The ceremony began, presided over by Zhu Kaimin, with Zhu Ximan as the assistant celebrant, assisted by Father Shen and Father Fa. Zhu Zhi Yao's son led the playing of the piano and singing, and the ceremony was held solemnly according to the prescribed rituals. At 8:30, the ceremony ended and the participants dispersed. The participants then took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. According to a member of the Zhu family, who spoke to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, yesterday's memorial mass was officiated by a bishop</p>
<p>Serving as the main celebrant is a grand mass in Catholicism, so in addition to the main celebrant, there is also an assistant celebrant. The ceremony is complete, and the chanting is also more complete, making it more solemn and grand than the previous memorial masses. Zhang Chongren also mentioned that Ma Xiangbo's family in Liangshan has sent a letter requesting him</p>
<p>To print 20,000 five-color memorial cards in Shanghai, with a portrait of Ma on the back, and distribute them to Catholic parishes and relatives throughout the country for permanent commemoration. They are currently being designed.</p>

<h3>Antimony Management Office Approves Sales of Antimony Products Needed by Factories</h3>
<p>However, it is required that the official agency certify that it is for its own use before it can be sold</p>
<p>The Antimony Management Office of the Economic General Resources Committee has stipulated that small factories in various places that need antimony products can purchase them directly from the office, but it is required that the official agency or official government certify that it is for its own use before it can be sold. The office has recently sent a letter to the Construction Departments of various provinces and relevant agencies to inform them in order to facilitate wartime industrial production.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Expands Switchboard</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Road West Telephone Added Numbers Starting with Six</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the population has surged, and the original lines and switchboard equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Company have become insufficient. All numbers in the Central District of the Public Concession starting with 10,000 and 90,000 and in the Central District of the French Concession starting with 8 and in the Western District starting with 7 will be full. This is especially true for numbers in the Western District of the Public Concession starting with 3. Therefore, the company has specially used the numbers starting with 6, which were previously used in the Central District of the Public Concession, as the numbers for new users in the district, including the area north of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, south of the Suzhou Creek, west of Yu Qiaqing Road, and as far as Jing'an Temple (excluding areas beyond the concession). If new users in the area request telephone installation, it will generally start with 60,000. More than 200 units have already been installed. At the same time, the company has decided to expand the manual switchboards starting with numbers 1, 9, 8, and 7 to facilitate users' installation and calls.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Pei Yunqing reported that today is the eighth redemption of principal of the 1936 Unified Public Debt Class E Bonds and the seventeenth redemption of principal of the 1935 Electrical Administration Public Debt. The lottery method for the Unified Public Debt uses the last three digits, and the lottery method for the Electrical Administration Public Debt uses the last two digits. I will briefly report on the circumstances of the above public debts to everyone. The Unified Public Debt Class E Bonds were issued in February 1936, with a fixed amount of 260 million yuan. This is the eighth redemption of principal, with eight draws, each draw worth 260,000 yuan, for a total of 2,080,000 yuan. The 1935 Electrical Administration Public Debt was issued in October 1935, with a fixed amount of 10 million yuan. This is the seventeenth redemption of principal, with three draws, each draw worth 100,000 yuan, for a total of 300,000 yuan. The payment of principal and accrued interest for the Electrical Administration Public Debt lottery winners will begin on December 31, 1939, and will be paid by the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various locations. The payment of principal and accrued interest for the Unified Public Debt lottery winners will begin on January 31, 1940, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, and will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized China and Communications Banks and the Central Trust Bureau in various locations. Now, I would like to ask the supervisors to check the lottery tickets and the ledger for accuracy before executing the lottery.</p>
<p>Winning Numbers</p>
<p>After the supervisors checked the lottery tickets and the ledger for accuracy, representatives from the Central, China, and Communications Banks executed the lottery. The winning numbers are listed below. (1) Unified Public Debt, eight draws: No. 033, No. 129, No. 281, No. 393, No. 676, No. 775, No. 831, No. 936. (2) Electrical Administration Public Debt, three draws: No. 20, No. 74, No. 83. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the eighth redemption of principal and payment of interest for the five types of Unified Public Debt (A, B, C, D, and E) will begin at the end of January next year, but the specific procedures will be announced by the Ministry at that time. The seventeenth redemption of principal and payment of interest for the Electrical Administration Public Debt is scheduled to begin on the 31st of this month, but due to the interception of international telegraph fees, which serve as collateral, it is feared that the payment of principal and interest due this time will continue to be delayed.</p>

<h3>Shame and Integrity Movement Holds Meeting, Sends Condolences to Wu Peifu's Family</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shame and Integrity Movement Committee believes that General Wu Ziyu was in an adverse environment, but was not tempted by profit or intimidated by power. He supported the Party and the country and was unswervingly loyal. Now that he has passed away due to tooth disease, the committee expresses its deep condolences and sends a telegram to General Wu's family to express its condolences. The telegram reads: "To the family of General Wu Ziyu in Beiping, greetings. Mr. Ziyu once held a military seal and had the demeanor of a Confucian general. He then hid in the mountains and forests, resolute in his ambition as a man. With tigers and wolves pressing in, he was not intimidated by force. With foxes and rats running rampant, he was able to maintain his purity and resist vulgarity. He was the righteousness of the country and a model for the people. Suddenly hearing the news of his death, the cause of death is quite suspicious. Looking forward to the smoke and dust, the living must be more inspired. We offer our condolences and hope you will restrain your grief. Shanghai Shame and Integrity Movement Committee seal."</p>
<p>All Circles Initiate the Construction of a Bronze Statue</p>
<p>After General Wu Ziyu, a famous Chinese Confucian general and veteran, passed away in Ping on the 4th of this month due to a tooth disease, the news spread and the whole country mourned. The Supreme National Defense Council believes that Wu has been in the enemy's atmosphere for several years, but he has remained unblemished, strictly rejected inducements and threats, and maintained his integrity in his later years, demonstrating his righteousness. Therefore, he was posthumously awarded the rank of first-class general, and the National Government issued an order to commend him in order to encourage and motivate. "This autumn, all circles in the city also believe that General Wu's loyalty is outstanding and his righteousness is awe-inspiring, which is not only enough to make the crowd ashamed, but also the national righteousness is relied upon to flourish. His great personality is enough to leave a fragrance in history and last forever. In today's atmosphere of demonism, if there is no commemoration of Wu, there will be no way to commemorate the sages and warn the unworthy. Therefore, it was decided to initiate the fundraising for a bronze statue of General Wu. However, due to the special environment in Shanghai, a committee will not be established for the time being. It was decided to first conduct fundraising separately, requesting major newspapers to temporarily collect the donations. After raising a considerable amount, the method of building the bronze statue will be discussed, or the proposal will be suggested to the central government for adoption, and the donations will be remitted to Chongqing to comfort the heroic spirit and last forever."</p>

<h3>Fuxing Road Traffic Restored</h3>
<p>Barbed Wire Has Been Removed Yesterday</p>
<p>The intersection of the bottom of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road was equipped with barbed wire frames and other obstacles during the Shanghai War. When the Japanese army blockaded the eastern section of North Jiangxi Road, another barbed wire frame was added there. The passage from North Jiangxi Road to Fuxing Road was also blocked by barbed wire and other obstacles, and pedestrians had to detour. Until yesterday, several Japanese soldiers carried knives and axes and removed the barbed wire frames placed at the intersection of the bottom of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road and at the passage to Fuxing Road. The traffic between North Jiangxi Road and Fuxing Road has now been restored, but the western side of the blocked area of North Jiangxi Road and the eastern section of Bazi Road are still blocked by barbed wire frames.</p>
<h3>After the Success of Sino-Soviet Airmail, Shanghai-Europe Airmail Route</h3>
<p>After the success of the Chongqing-Moscow air route, airmail to European countries can be sent via this route in the future.

Therefore, it has not been received and sent via the Sino-Soviet airmail route. However, post offices in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and Hami have begun to receive and send mail.</p>

<h3>Christmas Card Posting Schedule to Europe</h3>
<p>If Sent by Airmail, It Can Arrive in France Before the Holiday</p>
<p>Recently, as Christmas and the New Year are approaching, foreigners in the city are enthusiastically sending greeting cards. However, due to the war raging in Europe this year, the number of deliveries will inevitably be less than in previous years. On the 3rd of this month, a large batch of greeting card mail was shipped from Shanghai via the Suez Canal to Europe, and will arrive in Marseille on the 28th of this month and in London on the 30th. If sent by airmail, it will be sent from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 7th of this month, and then transferred to an airplane. It will take off on the 13th and arrive in Paris and Marseille on the 21st of this month, which is just before Christmas and more convenient than before. In addition, a large batch of European mail was sent to Europe via the Pacific Ocean yesterday (the 4th), and is expected to arrive in London on January 10th (1940). On the 11th of this month, another batch will be sent to Europe via the Suez Canal, and will arrive in London on January 13th.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Kidnapping Case Occurred on Jiaozhou Road the Night Before Last, Xiao Was Suddenly Kidnapped on the Way Home from the Theater, Watchman Reported to the Police with Suspicious Behavior and Was Detained, and the Suspect Was Arrested Together with the Domestic Servant</h3>
<p>At 8:50 p.m. the night before last, a kidnapping case occurred in House No. 11, Lane 148, Jiaozhou Road. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Xiao Shi, a Cantonese</p>
<p>He opened the Guangya Dyeing and Weaving Factory at the bottom of Jiaozhou Road and lived with his wife at No. 11, Lane 148, Jiaozhou Road. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Xiao went out to watch a movie in their own car No. 2477 and returned late at night. After dinner, Xiao went upstairs alone to rest in the bedroom. Unexpectedly, at 8:50 p.m., three kidnappers suddenly entered from the back door, showed guns, and threatened to make a noise. One of the kidnappers went upstairs,</p>
<p>Kidnapped Xiao</p>
<p>Dragged him into a pre-hired car, and drove away quickly. Before leaving, the bandits falsely said that they were sent by the police station, and told them not to be afraid. Unexpectedly, after the kidnappers left, not long after, Wang Jinshan, a watchman from No. 1470 in the lane, who was a native of Anhui, first broke into Xiao's house and reported to the police station by telephone that Xiao had been kidnapped. When the Jing'an Temple Police Station heard the alarm, they immediately sent Chinese detective Wu Wenke and Western detective Gulokov to investigate. Because the kidnappers had just left in this case, the people in the room had not yet reported to the police, but the doorkeeper Wang Jinshan already knew everything,</p>
<p>First Report</p>
<p>This situation was really suspicious, so he asked Wang for information. According to him, before the kidnappers kidnapped Xiao Shi, they first threatened him, took away his gun, and ordered him to face the wall. After the kidnapping, they returned the gun to him. His confession was vague and highly suspicious, so he was arrested and taken to the police station along with Lu Fusheng, a 14-year-old runaway servant from Anhui at Xiao's house. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the above situation, saying that Chen Fusheng and his brother Chen Yinsheng had been</p>
<p>Adopted and raised by Xiao since childhood</p>
<p>Later, Chen Yinsheng was introduced by someone to work at the Hollywood Casino. Recently, Chen Yinsheng asked Xiao's wife for a loan but failed. He held a grudge and once expressed in front of Wang Jinshan that he wanted to kidnap Xiao. Before the incident last night, Xiao's wife also saw Chen Yinsheng in the lane, so Wang Chen was highly suspected, and he should be allowed to be detained for investigation. After the judge Xiao checked the confession, he ordered that he be allowed to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple Is in Constant Litigation</h3>
<p>A temple of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple in Shengdeli, Rue du Pere Froc, French Concession, was mortgaged to the British business Guangdi Real Estate Company by the former abbot. Because it was not redeemed when it was due, the principal and interest totaled 18,000 yuan. Guangdi Company sued the Second Special Court, and the judgment was made to execute the auction. Abbot Qinliang of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou purchased it from Guangdi Company as a branch of Jingci Temple. When taking over, because the current</p>
<p>Abbot Yuanhua</p>
<p>The monks did not want to move out on the orders of the board of directors, Yuanhua filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Qinliang to confirm the ownership of the temple property, while Qinliang also filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Yuanhua for occupying the temple property and obstructing freedom. Yuanhua also filed a counterclaim, and it was discussed that criminal proceedings would be carried out after the civil confirmation of property rights was determined. Later, Monk Guanru, the abbot of Yuhuang Temple adjacent to Sanjiao Leshan Temple (formerly Abbot Yangxi of Jing'an Temple in the West of Shanghai), also filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court against Monk Qinliang for</p>
<p>Obstructing the Freedom of Worship</p>
<p>Qinliang also filed a counterclaim for false accusation. As a result, Qinliang was found not guilty, and Guanru was sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. The three parties were constantly litigating for the property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple. The situation has been recorded in previous reports. Now, Monk Qinliang has filed a complaint with the French Police Station, accusing Monks Guanru and Ziqing of occupying the property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple, which has made it impossible to take over for a long time since the purchase, and has obstructed freedom. He requested that the case be investigated. The police chief approved the words and summoned the two defendants to the case.</p>
<p>After an Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the two parties were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the French Concession Administrative Authority explained the case and filed a public prosecution on the charge of obstructing freedom. After Judge Qiu Huanxing questioned the plaintiff Qinliang and the defendants Guanru and Ziqing, he instructed that the hearing be postponed to the 20th for further investigation. After leaving the court, Monk Qinliang also</p>
<p>Incited the Case of Rolling Away</p>
<p>Wan Yuan was arrested and imprisoned and is now serving his sentence, while Sun Lanzhen confessed when she was arrested that she had taken out three gold bracelets and 2,000 yuan in cash when she rolled away, and handed them over to Wan Yuan, who transferred them to Qinliang for the purchase of the property of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple. Yang Yunwu then filed a lawsuit against Qinliang, and the court repeatedly issued summonses, but Qinliang avoided appearing in court. Yesterday, the investigating detective learned that Qinliang had come to court to respond to the case of Guanru and Ziqing obstructing freedom, so he took Qinliang to the police station to await verification.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Hardware Materials, Civil and Criminal Cases Adjudicated</h3>
<p>Fan Dazhang (also known as Fan Juemin), a native of Ningbo, was a broker in Fuxingxiang Hardware Store at No. 263 Chengdu Road. From August 15th to November 9th of this year, Fan suddenly used the names of Taikang Biscuit Company, Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xieji Timber Store, and Guangzhong Paper Mill to privately engrave seals. He used fraudulent methods to embezzle 9,038 yuan of hardware materials. Xie Shaofang, the owner of Fuxingxiang Store, found out and hired Lawyer Le Junwei to report to the police station, ordering the detectives to arrest Fan Dazhang and escort him to the First Special Court. After repeated interrogations, the case has been concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court. Fan Dazhang was sentenced to one year and two months' imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of business property. In the attached civil lawsuit, Fan Dazhang should repay the plaintiff 5,783 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen. If he is still unable to repay after compulsory execution, his guarantor Pu Meisheng shall be responsible for compensation. The forged receipts, return receipts, and seals shall be confiscated as listed.</p>
<h3>Impersonating and Claiming Remittances, Bailer to be Summoned for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Qianwen, a 17-year-old girl from Guangdong, residing at No. 32, Jiande Lane, Yuyuan Road, entrusted Ugo Cheiso, an Italian who had dealings with Citibank on Jiujiang Road, to guarantee between October 18th and last month, impersonating and claiming 1,800 US dollars (more than 20,000 legal currency) remitted from San Francisco, USA to Shanghai and delivered to Chen Sanmei. At the end of last month, Chen Sanmei, who resided at No. 4, Jing'an Villa, took a letter to the bank to question why the funds remitted from San Francisco had not been notified for collection for so long. At this point, the bank realized the mistake, so it secretly sent someone to the address to arrest Chen Qianwen and hand her over to the police station for escort to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention for investigation. The defendant claimed that she had an uncle doing business in San Francisco. When Citibank notified her to collect the funds last month, the name translated by the English translator was similar to her name. She thought it was the funds sent by her uncle and did not intend to defraud. The case was continued yesterday morning, and the police station filed a public prosecution against the defendant for fraud. Judge Zhan presided over the trial. The police station requested an extension because the Italian who guaranteed the collection of funds sent a telegram from Tokyo stating that he would return to Shanghai within three or four days to testify in court. The court checked the words and ordered the defendant to be remanded and the trial adjourned.</p>
<h3>Assassination Bloodbath on Foch Road, Ge Shusen Shot in the Leg, Later Admitted Himself to Fumin Hospital for Treatment</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, Ge Shusen, a certain team leader from Hebei who was assassinated on Foch Road the day before yesterday, hired a car himself after the incident and went to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment because Ge was shot in the leg during the assassination. Ge once served as an inspector of the former Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. At that time, there was a saying of the Four King Kongs among the inspectors, and Ge was also their team leader.</p>
<p>At around 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, a shooting incident occurred at the intersection of Foch Road and Weihaiwei Road, the boundary between the British and French concessions. Ge Shusen, the person who was shot, dodged quickly when he heard the gunshot and fell to the ground, thus escaping the disaster. At that time, three pedestrians were injured and two were killed by stray bullets, and the shooter was finally arrested. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the reporter of Huawen News Agency, the reason for this shooting is that Ge's nickname is Ah San, he is 50 years old, a native of Hebei Province, illiterate, and very burly. He used to serve as an inspector in the Municipal Police Bureau. Recently, a certain party commissioned him to organize the "Special Service Third Brigade." Ge did his best to flatter him, so he was valued by his superiors. Ge acted as an accomplice to the tiger and summoned bandits to join the team in the name of expanding the team, but they had to bring guns and equipment with them. When the guns and equipment were in hand, they were disbanded. Those who resisted were subjected to various tortures. Therefore, many people were fooled, so they were extremely resentful and came up with this strategy to avenge themselves.</p>
<h3>Zhang Deqing, the Owner of Huanhua Iron Factory, Was Kidnapped Yesterday and Was Taken Away by Two Female Bandits in a Car and Disappeared</h3>
<p>Huanhua Iron Factory is located at No. 364, Lane 1125, Yuyuan Road. The owner of the factory is named Zhang Deqing. The factory has a very thick capital and a considerable scale. Zhang's residence is in the French Concession. He must go to the factory every morning to work, and occasionally return home for lunch. Yesterday around noon at 12 o'clock, when Zhang was clearing debts in the factory and preparing lunch, more than a dozen male and female bandits suddenly rushed in with weapons and broke into Zhang's office. First, they drove and imprisoned all the staff in the room, and then two female bandits took out pistols and forced Zhang Deqing to follow them. Zhang had no choice but to let them do as they pleased. At that time, the two female bandits held Zhang on the left and right, went to the front of the factory gate, and made him enter a car parked on the side of the road and left. Afterwards, the factory urgently reported to the police station for assistance.</p>
<h3>Theft Cases Also Recorded</h3>
<p>At No. 118, Pingliang Road, East Shanghai, at around 6:30 last night, two bandits suddenly came, one of whom was holding a pistol. They were forbidden to make a noise and searched arbitrarily. When the bandits escaped with the loot, they were followed by the victim behind. When they arrived at the post office, they reported the information, and the police rushed to arrest one of the bandits and intercepted a bag of clothes. The other bandit managed to escape without a trace.</p>
<p>A certain watch shop at No. 693, Macdonnell Road, was robbed of dozens of watches by three bandits, one of whom was holding a pistol, at 7:20 last night.</p>
<p>Two passers-by at No. 588, Rue Massenet, were stopped by five thugs who blocked their way at around 7:25 last night. After a thorough search, there was no loss.</p>

Also, Dazhong Paper Store at No. 320 on the same road was robbed of 120 national currency by three bandits, one of whom was holding a pistol, who shouted and left at around 6:50 last night.</p>
<h3>The Group of Suicides</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuanming, a local man from Shanghai, Zhang Yuanming, 23 years old, worked at the Deli Piano Factory in No. 54, Wulin Lane, Yulin Road, East Shanghai. Due to the large number of people in his family and the high prices of everything recently, he felt economic pressure. The night before last, he went to Dales Hotel at No. 8, Lane 640, Route Voyron, and lived there in seclusion. At 7 a.m. the next morning, he committed suicide by swallowing poisonous potion. After being discovered, an ambulance was called to take him to the Hudong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>A Tourist, Zhang, a 26-year-old man from Ningbo, a guest at No. 34, Sanjiang Hotel, Beihai Road, did not know how, but he had the idea of dying. He secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide at around 12:52 p.m. yesterday. After being discovered, he was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Xu Zhaomei, Xu Zhaomei, a 19-year-old girl at No. 526, Connaught Road, swallowed raw opium and committed suicide at 3:05 p.m. yesterday due to family quarrels and unusual depression. Afterwards, she was taken to Tongren Hospital by family members for treatment by car.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuhe, Zhang Yuhe, a 44-year-old man from Hangzhou, has been unemployed for a long time and cannot maintain his livelihood. His clothes are ragged and he looks like a beggar. Unable to support himself due to poverty, he went alone to the Bund No. 10 Wharf at 6:19 last night and jumped into the river to commit suicide. After being rescued by people, he was rushed to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Zhang Wangshi, Zhang Wangshi (51 years old), a housewife from Nanjing, a resident of No. 379, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, suddenly hanged herself at home at 11:30 a.m. yesterday. After being discovered, she had died. The reason is unknown.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Gang Fight</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, a large gang suddenly started fighting at the intersection of Rue Robert and Rue Pignan in western Shanghai. At the time, the two sides had a total of thirty to forty gangsters gathered, arranged in formations, each wielding lethal weapons such as iron rods, iron rulers, knives, and axes. Pedestrians, seeing this, fled in alarm. As a result, many people on both sides were injured. It is said that the gang fight was caused by a feud between local gangs and gangs from Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Apprentice Injured</p>
<p>Kang Zhicai, an apprentice at the Xinchang Machinery Factory located at 1212 Avenue Edward VII, a sixteen-year-old native of Ningbo, was working at around 2:30 PM yesterday when, due to a moment's carelessness, his body was caught in a machine belt, lifted into the air, and his chest and arms were crushed. He was later rescued by his companions and taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qihui's Memorial Service Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qihui of Baoying, a member of a distinguished scholarly family, had resided in Shanghai for many years. Since the sudden outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Mr. Zhu suffered from asthma and suddenly passed away. His eldest son, Yinyu, who was away from home on business at the time, rushed back upon hearing the news. Upholding his father's last wishes, the funeral arrangements were kept simple. The remains were temporarily placed at the Jiangning Guild Hall. Originally, it was planned to choose a date to escort the coffin back home for burial and mourning. However, as Baoying has fallen, there is no hope of returning for burial. Moreover, the second anniversary of his death is approaching, and the mourning period will soon be over. A memorial service will be held today (the 10th) in Kuling. All relatives and friends are expected to attend, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We have read in your newspaper's local news column on the 6th of this month a news item titled "Opium Paraphernalia Confiscated from the National Correspondence School." The content vaguely states that someone had privately set up an opium den at the Qifeng Chinese Painting Correspondence School at No. 443 and 445 Kangti Road, and that opium paraphernalia and a pot of opium paste were confiscated from the principal's office, and that a woman named Gu Tong from Anhui and others were arrested. We are extremely shocked. According to our school, which has been established for many years and has already been approved and registered by the education authorities, our school's family members and others conduct themselves with integrity. We have neither established an opium den nor have any bad habits. However, there are many tenants living in the same building, and it is possible that some of them may possess opium paraphernalia. As for the confiscation of opium paraphernalia from the principal's office, this is completely unfounded. This matter concerns the reputation of our school, so we are writing this letter to request that your newspaper grant us a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column, so as to avoid confusion and rumors. This is our sincere request. Sincerely, The Qifeng Chinese Painting Correspondence School, December 9th.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and this area will be sunny and cold with strong, biting northwesterly winds. The East China Sea will be sunny with strong, biting northerly to easterly winds. The center of the hurricane moved to within 120 miles of 16 degrees north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude yesterday afternoon, stopped moving forward, or deviated to the north to northeast. The wind force is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 62.6 degrees, and the lowest was 41.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 6.1 degrees, and the lowest was 51.0 degrees.</p>
<h3>Idle Funds Gather in Shanghai: Real Estate Transactions Active</h3>
<p>The sale of the New World site in this city has become the largest real estate transaction of this year. However, according to the reporter's investigation, there was another large real estate transaction in the past, but because both parties kept it secret at the time, it was not noticed by the public. According to reports, the original site of the former Sofa Garden at the corner of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, covering more than 20 mu of land, was sold to Anping Company by a British real estate company this autumn. According to recent news, the owner, in order to comply with the wishes of all sectors of society, has specially allocated a portion of the land to be developed into a high-end residential area, subdividing it into plots for sale. It is said that Wuhe Foreign Firm has been commissioned to design it, and construction will begin next spring along the road, building new-style city houses and apartments (see picture). The area is quiet and secure, and it is expected that there will be many buyers at that time. It can be seen that the completion of large real estate transactions will lead to many smaller transactions.</p>

<h3>Offense and Defense Inferior to the Enemy's Rampage: Tung Wah Suffers a Crushing Defeat to Westfords; Two Goals Scored with Difficulty in the Second Half; Zhuang Youren Absent Yesterday, Leaving the Defense Empty</h3>
<p>Western Union Football League Group A, Tung Wah vs. Westfords, kicked off at Recreation Ground at 2:30 PM yesterday. The referee was Pei Nan. Impressed by Tung Wah's victory over the British team last week, no fewer than 3,000 spectators gathered on the north and south stands, making it extremely lively. However, Zhuang Youren, a key defender of Tung Wah, was unable to attend due to work commitments and was replaced by Hu Hanwen. Hu was less experienced and often had loopholes, which affected the overall situation. The Soviet army performed brilliantly, and the forwards were especially sharp, regaining their vigor from last year. They controlled the entire first half and won by five goals (the fourth goal was a penalty kick. When Duncan kicked the ball, Sipes was standing in the semicircle of the penalty area, which should have been invalid, because the rules stipulate that when taking a penalty kick, all players on both sides, except the kicker and the goalkeeper, should stand outside the penalty area and must be ten yards away from the penalty spot. This goal was ruled valid, and the referee was clearly negligent.) After changing sides, Wu Luo successively scored for Tung Wah, seemingly showing signs of revival, but it was only a flash in the pan. Sipes scored another goal, resulting in a 2-6 defeat for Tung Wah to Westfords. At the same time, the Tung Wah youth team played against East Seles at Zhendan, resulting in a 0-3 defeat for Tung Wah.</p>

<h3>Food: Can We End the People's Woe and Sorrow, And Let Hoarders Make a Fortune? Market Sits and Profits from Each Transaction, Small People Shed Blood and Tears for Every Unit of Grain, Prices Rise Without End</h3>
<p>According to reports, the rice market opened early yesterday with about 14 or 15 trucks of goods arriving near the Suzhou-Jiading Road area. Sellers continued to hold back, refusing to show samples. As soon as inquiries were made, prices soared. Regardless of whether it was japonica or indica rice, the price was called up by more than two yuan in an instant, and ordinary japonica rice even reached nearly 49 yuan. The higher it was raised, the higher it went. The situation rebounded again at noon. This has been the consistent style of the rice market in recent days. A large number of transactions have already been completed, and hoarders are manipulating the market from selling to profiting. Only the working class suffers, struggling to buy a liter of rice with the sweat of their labor, watching helplessly as unscrupulous merchants freely manipulate the market and make a fortune without any prevention. In fact, as long as the arrivals are investigated from various import and export sources, all the rice that arrives is concentrated in the market, and purchased by various rice shops to meet market demand. The market price is determined publicly according to the quantity of arrivals and the needs of the market, and everyone must abide by it. It is absolutely forbidden to hoard rice in warehouses. If this method is followed, the price of rice can be stabilized immediately in a few days. On the one hand, thoroughly investigate the rice stored in various public and private warehouses, and on the other hand, investigate the fixed amount of foreign rice with various foreign firms, and order the rice industry to report the orders. Then, discuss the entire food management method. Even if the food situation in Shanghai cannot be restored to its previous state, there will eventually be a day of stability. How can we remain indifferent and inactive? At the close of the market yesterday, prices rose by half a yuan to nearly one yuan, regardless of japonica or indica rice. Special japonica rice from the Changbang area was 48 yuan, middle japonica rice was 46 to 47 yuan, and Saigon rice was 39 yuan and 38.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Ke Xian rice soared in unison with other types of rice, rising by another one or two yuan compared to the previous market. It was then sold by floating profit-takers. Moreover, there were two full shipments of foreign rice, and Ke Xian rice has recently been arriving in Shanghai from the Jiangxi, Beijing, Wuhu, and Hankou areas, and raw rice is also being transported in an endless stream. Therefore, the market turned flat later in the day. However, it still rose by seven or eight cents compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>New foreign rice is difficult to allocate. Several previous telegrams have not been replied to, but most of the orders have been loaded. Yesterday, there were 25,000 bags being unloaded, and another 22,000 bags arrived in Pudong waiting to be unloaded. In the early morning, the spot market was once again manipulated and inflated by hoarders and speculators, and Saigon rice was once called up to 40 yuan. The result was 39 yuan. Relocated road cargo gradually became lively. Yesterday's total turnover was 745 tons, with prices ranging from 45.5 yuan to 46.1 yuan, all calculated by the original package.</p>
<p>Another 3,640 bags of newly arrived foreign rice arrived yesterday morning, transported from Rangoon by the Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship. It is said that the ship also carries a lot of foreign rice bound for North China, but the exact number is unknown.</p>
<h3>Speculative Trading Focused on Japanese Flour; Rumors of Soybean Control Again</h3>
<p>The trend of flour yesterday was peaceful, because after repeated increases, actual sales gradually cleared. Some miscellaneous brands of flour have already been dumped in this street, so the turnover is less than 30,000 bags. The No. 2 flour factory's offer is temporarily stable. Returned goods, artillery powder, continued to open at 8.5 yuan, but at present, speculation is focused on trading Japanese flour because the factory's flour has been restricted and the warehouse list chips have long been exhausted. Therefore, the market for Phoenix brand flour and other flours fluctuates. The market opened at 8.3 yuan yesterday, and buyers were not greedy. As a result, it hovered around two cents. Today, 24,000 bags of flour were transported to Tianjin and 500 bags to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is still scarce, and the Shanghai stocks have been held by speculators, unwilling to release them, resulting in the market price repeatedly reaching new peaks. Only one truck was sold in the market yesterday, with the price opening at 13.65 yuan.</p>
<p>The soybean market was stable in the morning because the soybean oil market was stable, and the soybeans did not change much. With purchases from exporters and local buyers, the market price rose by two cents. A total of more than 3,000 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at a price of 17.6 yuan, three trucks of Nanjing soybeans were traded at a price of 17.15 yuan and 17 yuan, 300 to 400 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans were traded at a price of 18.3 yuan, 150 bags of Jiangbei soybeans were traded at a price of 16.43 yuan, and 500 bags of Chongming sand soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 18.1 yuan to 18.45 yuan. However, the situation changed dramatically in the afternoon. Rumors spread that goods that had not yet been unloaded were suddenly detained and that the place of origin was uniformly controlled. As a result, a sudden storm arose, and the undertow was huge. Sellers disappeared from the market, and even with a price increase of half a yuan, there was still a shortage of goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 120 bags of northern sand soybeans arrived, and today, 78 bags are being transported to Xiamen and 1,370 bags are being transported to Hong Kong. There are also 425 bags of raw kernels being transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Currency Market Ordinary</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was stable. HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The informal market for British and American exchange rates was ordinary in the first half of the day, with occasional rises and falls, but the range was small. The course of the day was as follows: In the morning, the British pound was slightly softer, reported at 4 shillings 4.6875 pence, while the U.S. dollar was still reported at 7.28125 yuan. Later, because importers purchased futures for this month, and some profiteers also entered the market, the situation was stable and slightly softer. The U.S. dollar once tightened to 7.25 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong Electric sold out, and a Chinese bank also sold some, so the situation immediately returned to normal. Trading was even scarcer at noon, so it closed in a stable state. The British pound was at 4 shillings 4.84375 pence, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.28125 yuan, the same as the previous day. The trend of futures remained the same as the spot market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Still Has Sales</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bars, near and distant futures, each fell by 0.1875, the New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold was stagnant, and the exchange rates of British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The U.S. dollar was slightly lower than the British, Shanghai, and French currencies by 0.125. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 shillings 4.84375 pence for the British pound and 7.28125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared with the previous close, the British pound tightened by 0.015625, while the U.S. dollar was neither good nor bad. After the opening, foreign firms first came to pull in, and foreign firms entered into a settlement for this month's spot British pounds at 4 shillings 4.6875 pence, and the situation was stable without change. Until HSBC's listed price was announced without change, the silver balance tax was announced down by a small amount. After that, a profit came to settle the spot US dollar in a certain bank at 7.28125 yuan and 25 yuan, and the market seemed to be slightly soft. But not long after, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to sell the spot British pound to Hua Bi at 4 shillings and 4.84375 pence, and at that time, the Zhongxing Bank of China also came to sell the spot US dollar to Datong at 7.28125 yuan, so the process returned to normal. Transactions became clearer at noon, so the state became more stagnant. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 shillings and 4.84375 pence for the British pound, and 7.28125 yuan for the U.S. dollar. The British pound for this month was at 4 shillings and 4.6875 pence, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.25 yuan. The British pound for January was at 4 shillings and 4.375 pence, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.15625 yuan. As a result, there was no difference between the current period of British and American exchange rates compared with the day before yesterday. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th: The currency market opened flat this morning. Exchange rates in various regions were neither good nor bad. At 11:05, the Shanghai Exchange spot rate rose slightly by one yuan to 332 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable without rising or falling. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Lengthened</p>
<p>Tianjin, 9th: The currency market opened sluggishly this morning. The spot British exchange rate loosened by 0.125 to 4 pence 0.0625. The spot American exchange rate also lengthened by 0.25 to 6.5625 yuan. The Shanghai Exchange rate dropped slightly by half a yuan to 111 yuan. The informal market for "Joint Notes" rose slightly by 2.5 cents to 92.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Stagnation: Fluctuations Only a Few Dozen Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market was tepid and unclear. Due to the stagnation of foreign exchange, fluctuations were minimal, only rising and falling by about ten yuan. However, the underlying trend was firm. Although some money changers continued to release cash and some gold shops sold on behalf of speculators, the Hong Kong syndicate frequently commissioned certain silver shops to handle transactions, and the volume was considerable. Ultimately, the price rose by ten yuan, opening ten yuan higher at 4,180 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market softened slightly, coupled with purchases by certain securities firms and the Hong Kong syndicate, the price briefly rose to 4,200 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market suddenly reported a return to par, and the selling intentions of some money changers and gold shops intensified. Although the Hong Kong syndicate continued to buy, many general long positions also closed, making it difficult to match the supply. As a result, the price returned to 4,180 yuan at the noon close, the same as the morning opening. In the afternoon, the off-exchange trend continued to strengthen, as gold shops absorbed supply previously, and some money changers followed suit. It was rumored that the final price was 4,188 yuan, with over 2,000 taels traded during the half-day session. Silver shop jewelry was priced five yuan higher, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Tepid Market Rises Ten Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened quietly and firmly. At 9:35 AM, the market opened ten yuan higher, with money changers buying 50 taels from gold shops at 4,180 yuan. Subsequently, a silver shop bought on behalf of a client, raising the price by another ten yuan, with money changers trading ten taels at 4,190 yuan. At that time, securities firms released dozens of taels, and silver shops also sold, causing a drop of ten yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to gold shops at 4,180 yuan. Later, due to the steady and slightly soft foreign exchange market, some securities firms and others came to the market to buy. Soon, the Hong Kong syndicate commissioned a silver shop to buy again, raising the price by another twenty yuan, with securities firms buying 30 taels from other firms at 4,200 yuan. When the Hong Kong syndicate stopped buying, the price immediately fell. Gold shops and money changers mutually helped large clients to sell, and soon the price fell another twenty yuan, with gold shops selling twenty taels to money changers at 4,180 yuan. Later, a silver shop again bought on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, raising the price by ten yuan, with money changers buying twenty taels from securities firms at 4,190 yuan. At noon, securities firms continued to release supply, and at the same time, some gold shops and others were still willing to sell, so the silver shop suddenly gave up, quoting the price at 4,185 yuan. The silver shop then absorbed 160 taels from a gold shop and dozens of taels from retail investors. Later, as the Hong Kong syndicate was satisfied with its purchases, the price fell back by five yuan, with money changers mutually trading twenty taels at 4,180 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, the market rose by ten yuan compared to the previous day, with only a twenty yuan fluctuation in the half-day session. The selling price of cash gold shops was a few yuan higher than the tepid market, and the buying price was reduced by about twenty yuan. Spot gold was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Up Five Yuan</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry was sold at 420 yuan per tael at the beginning, but at 9:50 AM, it was priced five yuan higher. There were no changes after that. As a result, the large shops changed the price to 425 yuan, the same as the new shops. The buying price was reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Shortage Remains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for British and American gold pounds increased, and market prices were firm. The supply and demand for gold tickets were balanced, and British tickets remained stable. The evening price of American tickets was 13 yuan and 67 fen, only one fen lower than the previous night, indicating that the market price was not easy to fall. The supply of Hong Kong and French tickets was not smooth, and the demand for Annam tickets increased, with market prices firm. The supply of Canadian tickets was scarce, and market prices were high. The demand for Japanese gold tickets was not strong, and the market was slightly weak, with the evening price at 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 4 fen and 4 li. Korean tickets were also sluggish, with the evening price at 1 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both rose by one yuan, American gold tickets fell by one fen, Hong Kong and French tickets both rose by five li, Annam tickets rose by five fen, Canadian tickets rose by two jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stock Trading Remarkable, Domestic Bonds Stagnant</h3>
<p>The securities market was even more stagnant yesterday, with most people remaining on the sidelines, both sides holding their positions and waiting for a change in the environment. The simplest observation at present is whether there will be a new agreement before the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty. This kind of future change is more important and is still in the brewing stage. Yesterday, Type Wu bonds were drawn, so the market transaction has been calculated excluding the lottery, which is one yuan more than those with the lottery. According to the price excluding the lottery the day before yesterday, it is still slightly better by five fen. Only Type Bing bonds had some transactions, and the rest were extremely rare. The market price still only had a difference of five fen and one jiao, with a transaction volume of more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: A large number of Dada Shipping Company shares were traded, with 50 shares traded at a price of 36 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The public market of the General Chamber of Commerce had remarkable transactions. In industrial stocks, whether belonging to the speculative or investment category, the buying power was extremely superior. International Trust, Yangtze Silver Company, Jardine Matheson, and Steel stocks all received new support and became active. Jardine Matheson Textile once rose to a high price of 26 and a half yuan. At the close, the price of Telephone stock was 21 yuan and 75, and there were buyers. Because of the world's low rubber reserves, there was a lack of supply, so many neglected stocks, especially Ximen Bu and Xue Na Wang, rose rapidly. At the close, all stocks had buyers.</p>
<p>London, August 8th: Today, the listed prices of British companies in the Far East have fallen slightly. The unnameable shares of Kaiping Coal Mine fell one shilling to seventeen shillings and six pence. The Gulag Kerin Bang Rubber shares fell six pence, remaining at twenty shillings and seven pence, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, August 8th: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remain stable, and there are no changes in the bonds at the top and bottom.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Local Cotton Trading Becomes More Lively, Profit-Taking and Reselling Slow Down the Rise, Tens of Thousands of Bales of American Cotton Purchased in Advance</h3>
<p>Local cotton trading is still active, and factories are also actively purchasing, so transactions are becoming more and more frequent. Anda and Xinyu factories are absorbing the most, while others have not yet taken action. As for the market price level, it was originally intended to rise sharply, because some of the profits have been considerable, and there is a doctrine of holding out for sales to make money. As a result, the price increase has been slow. However, most of the industry is optimistic about the rise, with Fire Machine Flower expected to see 160 yuan, and Tong Flower to see 170 yuan. The selling price today is 167 and a half yuan for Tong Flower, which is two and a half yuan higher than the previous day. There are 3,130 bales of Tong Flower from Subei, 515 bales of Changyinsha Flower, and 5,684 bales of Beisha. The current cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market has been very firm recently. The US government's second change to export subsidies is generally expected to cause the market to fall. However, the market opened surprisingly well this morning, rising more than ten points again. Subsequently, due to good spot transactions and aggressive purchases by overseas cotton merchants, the cotton price was very stable. Although there was some profit-taking in the middle, the closing price rose six to seven points to more than ten points compared to the previous day. India also rose more than ten rupees, Egypt rose more than seventy points, and Liverpool rose more than twenty pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The day before yesterday, in order to try to take advantage of the second reduction in export subsidies, American cotton was purchased in advance, hoping to get an export subsidy of 75 points. The total transaction was about tens of thousands of bales from all parties. In the future, American cotton may be weak, but according to rumors from various parties, because the US government's export subsidy fund is about to be exhausted, it is possible that the Secretary of Agriculture will petition the government to stop this only 40-point subsidy. The cotton market price yesterday, converted into factory prices at the US exchange rate of 7.25, is as follows: 20-count American Mid-ling 220.20; 20-count American Mid-ling lower grade 225.65; 32-count American Mid-ling 237.30; 32-count American Mid-ling lower grade 231.10; 42-count American Mid-ling 241.15; 42-count American Mid-ling lower grade 241.95.</p>
<p>The US Department of Agriculture announced that the amount of the sixth cotton production report this year is 11,792,000 bales, a decrease of 52,000 bales from the previous report.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Syndicate's Demand for Single Yarn Recovers, 20-Count Yarn Still Has Thick Inventory, Nothing More Than Being Driven Up by Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The yarn market has seen price increases, because not only is it difficult for the overseas cotton market to loosen, but it is also seeing a slow pace forward. As a result, people unanimously expect prices to rise. At the same time, the demand from the Guangdong syndicate has recovered, and buyers and hoarders are even more excited. The market price is firm. However, it is found that the inventory of 10-count yarn is still thick, so the fundamental problem is nothing more than being driven up by raw materials. Factories cannot make profits based on the current cotton price, so they are unanimously dragging in, and the situation is becoming more lively.</p>
<p>When the yarn market opened in the morning, the industry gathered together, and the mood was particularly firm. Because the off-market trading had already seen an increase the day before yesterday, speculators, seeing the improved environment, were very active in buying. The opening price rose seven yuan, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 718 yuan. Then, Yong'an Factory opened 150 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng, with a price of only 711 yuan, and the market was restrained again, falling back by two yuan. A little later, it was heard that the Hong Kong syndicate needed single yarn, and a speculator suddenly bought more than 100 bales, and the market suddenly became noisy, and the price rose steadily to 727 yuan. It was found that the half-day trading statistics were 2,830 bales. The price of 20-count Bianma rose 15 yuan, Double Earth rose 10 yuan, and Tiannv rose 10 yuan. 330 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong on the 10th, and 200 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of purchases by each syndicate is listed on the left: Hong Kong 830; Same Industry 1,890; Mainland 70; Xiamen 40; Total 2,830.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diaoqing Rises Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tightest for domestic Diaoqing, with a total of 2,000 bags opened at a price of 30 yuan, up about two yuan. Chao syndicate also opened dozens of bags of Huanggangqing at 40 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of 7 jiao. The Public Association's foreign sugar market saw mixed rises and falls. Spot 24 crude white slightly fell, with the local warehouse at 55 yuan 7 jiao to 56 yuan 3 jiao, and new goods at the foreign warehouse at 57 yuan and old goods at 56 yuan 7 jiao to 8 jiao. However, transit goods rose again by one yuan due to the Hong Kong syndicate's appetite, with a price of 47 yuan and a half to 48 yuan, with 400 bags traded. Taikoo White also fell by a small half yuan, B Mark East Warehouse 55 and a half yuan, West Warehouse 56 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged, H Mark Che Chi 40 yuan, He Chi 41 yuan to 41 and a half yuan. This cotton white and No. 1 ice are lacking in change. It was found that 1,635 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: New White Chrysanthemum Production Price is High</h3>
<p>White chrysanthemum, that is, tea chrysanthemum, is now in the new season. According to a letter from a client in Xieqiao, Haining, the production price is very high, and the market price is 120 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Dust Increases Water Footprint</h3>
<p>The white coal dust business is usually only needed by coal ball factories as raw materials for large-scale purchases, and the market price rarely changes. Recently, due to the increase in the water footprint of three shillings, the cost per ton has increased by six yuan. Hongji White Coal No. 1 dust has also risen from 61 yuan to 67 yuan. Retail in Menzhuang is 3 yuan and 6 jiao per dan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Nanyang Purchases Printed Cloth Endlessly</h3>
<p>The cloth market has risen due to the rising cost of raw materials, yarn and cotton, and the mood is stable. The demand for hoarders and local dye factories is gradually increasing. The market price of fine cloth and fine twill from brands such as Dapeng and Fugui has risen by 2 jiao and a half to 5 jiao per piece, and the price of coarse cloth has risen by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth has also risen across the board, with the price increasing by about 5 jiao per piece. The local market has seen particularly strong transactions, totaling more than 2,000 pieces. The Hong Kong syndicate has purchased more than 100 packages of coarse and fine twill. The Yong syndicate has purchased nearly 100 pieces of fine and coarse cloth. Overseas sales continue to be smooth, and the Nanyang syndicate purchases printed cloth endlessly. On the 10th, there were 81 pieces of piece goods shipped to Xiamen and 145 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Eastern cloth market saw continued price increases due to the firm rise of yarn and thread, and the mood was high. The morning opening price of the fine cloth from the White Goods Longtou was 20 yuan and 8 jiao and a half per piece. In the later market, because the industry and hoarders still had strong intentions to buy, the price gradually rose to 21 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. Ito, Dongmian and other companies opened more than 500 pieces of Longtou fine cloth futures, with the price ranging from 21 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 21 yuan and 5 jiao for this month, and the price for January was even more surprisingly high, ranging from 22 yuan and 5 jiao to 21 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. About 4500 pieces of this month's goods from other brands such as Laba, Wufu, and Caiqiu were opened, with a morning price of 20 yuan per piece and an afternoon price of 20 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. The closing price of the Four Gentlemen Serge was 6 jiao, 6 fen and 7 and a half li per yard.</p>

<h3>The Vigorous New Capital</h3>
<p>— Ju Chen</p>
<p>Sichuan—Sichuan, whose land area is larger than the mainland of Japan, with its fertile soil, rich products, and superior position... Everyone knows that it is the base of our country's war of resistance; and the key to controlling this base is Ba County (i.e., Chongqing). In the past, Sichuan, apart from Chengdu, Ba County was actually the leader among the 146 counties in the province. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the National Government moved into Bashu, and Chongqing became the new capital.</p>
<p>The Area is About to Increase Threefold</p>
<p>Chongqing was established as a city in May of this year (28th year). Its area is about 147 square kilometers. Recently, the suburbs have been incorporated into the city. The preliminary work of surveying the boundaries has been completed, and by the end of this year, the area of the city can be increased three times. With the expansion of the area, the budget will naturally also increase. This year's budget is more than 3 million yuan, and it is expected that the income will increase by 7 million yuan next year. Planning to Build a Ring Road Around the City</p>
<p>Although the Japanese planes are constantly flying back and forth, the government still allocated 10 million yuan to build a ring road around the city, which is expected to be completed in three years. Everyone knows that Chongqing is located on the delta where the Jialing River and the Yangtze River meet, and there is a saying that "there is no three feet of flat land," so it can be said to be a mountainous peninsula. Building roads is naturally doubly difficult. Some places near the valley also need to build 60-foot-high embankments. Therefore, only 30% of this 10 million yuan is used to purchase land, and 70% must be used for engineering, which shows the arduousness of the work and the unremitting spirit of the government authorities. As for transportation with the outside world, it can be said that it is accessible by water, land, and air. This is unnecessary to elaborate on.</p>
<p>The road construction plan is planned to be implemented in the first month of next year, because tax revenue can be increased at that time, and after the road is built, the value of the land will increase. It is also worthwhile to sell the excess land purchased at a low price now, so that the cost of road construction can be recovered. There are quite a few slums along the banks of the two rivers now. In the future, when the road is completed, buses and public buses (also some trams) will be speeding by, which will surely make people feel the vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>Building Tunnels and Residential Areas</p>
<p>Another plan is to build underground tunnels connecting the downtown area and the southern area to avoid the current labor of detouring on the road. At the same time, it can also be used as an air-raid shelter for millions of yuan. If we start in three places, it will take about six months to complete.</p>
<p>According to the method of dispersing the population, it is planned to build affordable housing areas in the suburbs. The addresses have been selected in several places, and a loan of 3 million yuan has been obtained from the Bank of China as construction costs. In the first phase, it is planned to build four places first, followed by eight places. Each place has a park, a sports field, surrounded by shops and residences. These shops and residences may be built by the municipal government or by the people themselves.</p>
<p>Financial Budget and Population</p>
<p>Chongqing is now the center of transportation in the northwest and southwest, and ferries are also being improved. The population of the city was 500,000 before the bombing, but now it is only 380,000 due to evacuation. If it were not wartime, it could not become a special municipality. According to regulations, a special municipality must have a population of one million to be established and directly under the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>This year's Chongqing budget is 3.3 million, 32.08% is used for public safety, 25.6% is used for public construction, 11% is used for education and social undertakings, and 31.32% is used for public health. Next year, we plan to add a little more to the education budget.</p>
<p>The vigorous new capital is like an oil pool, the more it is bombed, the more prosperous it becomes. The original Chongqing, "a leaf floating in the country of Ba, with two rivers floating around the Futu Pass," is actually the origin of our nation's "Chongqing" regeneration.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Life in the New Capital</h3>
<p>— Ya Wen</p>
<p>If you come to the new capital and take a look, you will feel infinitely surprised; because the new capital in wartime, although it has been bombed repeatedly, has not only not become a ruin,</p>
<p>Instead, it is becoming more prosperous every day, and the people are showing a solemn and happy appearance. Everyone believes that the time for final victory is not far away. The cars flowing money on the road are endless. The bombed place is immediately covered with bungalows made of bamboo. The land price in the Yushi Street, Wuku Street, Doyou Street, and Quanggongju Street areas has risen to more than 700 yuan per square foot, and the landlord is still unwilling to let go. The goods in the store have everything they should have, as long as you can afford the price, any cosmetics, photographic materials, woolen tweed, canned food, can be bought at will.</p>
<p>Clothing: The clothing of the new urban residents is very simple. The most fashionable for women is to wear cheongsams with blue cloth faces, and Ann Ann blue cloth is in short supply on the face of the new capital. Ordinary men mostly like to wear cloth Zhongshan suits. The labor cost of tailor shops is very expensive. An ordinary three-piece suit, excluding the woolen material, costs no less than 30 yuan in wages; therefore, there are not as many people wearing suits as in Shanghai. Male and female students all wear the prescribed uniforms and walk on the street, which is very neat. Noble women in the new capital do not wear high-heeled leather shoes, because the municipal government stipulates that prostitutes only wear high-heeled leather shoes, so no one is willing to imitate.</p>
<p>Food: In terms of food, in addition to Sichuan restaurants, all other types of restaurants are available. Cantonese cuisine such as Dasanyuan and Guanshengyuan; Suzhou cuisine such as Songhelou, Northern cuisine such as Yanshi Restaurant, Ningbo cuisine with Siming Night Snack Restaurant, Yangzhou cuisine with Slender West Lake, and several Nanjing cuisine restaurants such as Guotai. None of them are not thriving. Every night when the lights come on, there is always no space, spitting out a batch of people and swallowing another batch of people. Although there are also several Western restaurants, the taste is not as good as Shanghai because the production of fresh fish is not high and the refining of cream is not very effective. Several new Russian restaurants have recently opened. A small pot of borscht, slightly served with bread, does not cost much, and can fill the stomach, so many people tend to go there, and the business is quite good.</p>
<p>Transportation: Although the roads in the new capital are not as wide as those in Shanghai, pedestrians can abide by the rules of walking, so although the narrow road is full of pedestrians, there will never be any crowding or conflicts. Especially during gatherings, the masses abide by order, file in, and there is no sound of rushing or shouting. This point has aroused the admiration of foreigners.</p>
<p>Hygiene: The locals in the new capital have a Ni Zan-like cleanliness. There are more bathrooms in the city than in other places, and ordinary bathrooms are equipped with places to receive women, as well as so-called family bathrooms. Ordinary families take their families to bathe together. The bathing fee is calculated by time, ranging from one to two yuan per hour. Now the municipal government is afraid that some people will bring prostitutes to pretend to be family members to take a bath, and for the sake of maintaining customs, it has ordered those who run bathhouses to separate men's and women's bathrooms, not to allow them to bathe together again, and not to allow them to stay overnight.</p>
<p>Foreigners: There are recently more than 360 foreign nationals in the new capital (excluding the Navy), with women accounting for one-third. Most of them are embassy staff and missionaries. The rest are representatives of commercial operations. Since the outbreak of the war with Germany, British, German, and French expatriates have been talking about the news of the war in their home countries in cafes, and they are ready to return to serve their countries at any time.</p>
<p>Air Defense: The air defense deployment in the new capital is extremely thorough. Many new air-raid shelters have been dug, divided into three major areas: the urban area, Jiangbei, and Nan'an, with a total of more than 500 air-raid shelters, which can accommodate more than 60,000 people. In the event of an air raid, the air defense headquarters will issue an alarm with electric sirens, and the people will not panic when they hear the alarm. They will enter the shelter together, and some will carry books and read without stopping in the light of kerosene lamps or flashlights in the air-raid shelter. The calmness of their attitude can be seen.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Products and Commerce</h3>
<p>— Shao Tang</p>
<p>Chongqing does not produce much rice, and mostly relies on the supply of neighboring counties. The output of miscellaneous grains such as potatoes, corn, peanuts, sesame and various beans is extremely rich, especially beans, because the climate is earlier than the lower Yangtze River. Even in the winter season, fresh beans can be eaten. In addition, the output of livestock such as chickens and ducks and fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, pears, etc. is also extremely rich. The development of mineral products is very small. Coal is the main product extracted from the nearby mountains; in Shiyougou, Nan'an, there is natural outflow of petroleum that can be used.</p>
<p>The most famous factory is the improved silk factory run by the Sichuan Silk Industry Institute. There are more than 4,000 looms in the city. There is a cement factory in Nan'an with a very large scale, and its output is sufficient for the entire Sichuan province. The bleached bristles produced by the Chuanyu Pig Bristle Factory are sold in Europe and the United States and are especially famous. Since the War of Resistance, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a total of more than 340 factories have moved from Shanghai and Wuhan to the inland, including about 150 machinery and hardware industries, more than 20 electrical and radio industries, about 40 chemical industries, about 10 ceramic and glass industries, about 20 food and beverage industries, 60 textile industries, and more than 40 printing industries. Among them, four-tenths have been moved to Sichuan Province, and some of them have already started construction in Chongqing. There are four yarn factories, namely Qingxin, Yuhua, Yufeng, and Dacheng. According to the industry, there are currently more than 50,000 yarn factories in Chongqing. The main export commodities are tung oil, raw silk, medicinal materials, pig bristles, cow leather, and sheepskin, while the main import commodities are piece goods, cotton yarn, hardware, Soviet goods, and pigments. Among the export commodities, tung oil is the most famous, accounting for the first place in my country's export commodities. In addition to the Juxingcheng Zhongzhongjiaonong four banks, Shanghai Bank and Zhejiang Xingye Bank also have branches. Financial activities are lively, and the atmosphere is new every day.</p>
<h3>Transportation in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Because Chongqing is surrounded by water on three sides, water transportation is convenient. Foreign ships navigating the Yangtze River westward have always used this as their terminal. Before the war, the two giant ships, "Minyuan" and "Minben," operated by Mr. Lu Zuofu of Sichuan, sailed directly from Chongqing to Shanghai, taking only ten days downstream and no more than two weeks upstream. Due to the current war situation, downstream navigation only reaches Yichang, while upstream navigation reaches Jiading, and northward navigation reaches Hechuan. In addition, there are small steamers traveling to various locations, such as the Yu-Fu Line from Chongqing to Fuling, the Yu-Mu Line from Chongqing to Mudong, the Yu-Song Line from Chongqing to Songgai, the Yu-Wen Line from Chongqing to Wenquan, and the Yu-Ci Line from Chongqing to Ciqikou. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is currently under construction but not yet open to traffic. The main highways are divided into westward and southward lines. The westward line runs directly from Chongqing to Chengdu, totaling 450 kilometers, and connects to the northwest highway. The southward line runs directly to Guiyang, totaling 488 kilometers. In addition, there is the Yu-Yuan Highway from Chongqing to Yuanling in Hunan, totaling 993 kilometers, but it is not yet fully open to traffic. There is also a short-distance bus service from Chongqing to Ciqikou, called the Yu-Ci Line. On the Chongqing-Guiyang section, there is also the Haitangxi-Wenquan branch line from Haitangxi in Chongqing to Wenquan. On the Chongqing-Chengdu section, there is also the Qingmuguan-Beibei branch line from Qingmuguan in Chongqing to Beibei. Public buses operated by bus companies run within the city, divided into four routes. One route runs between Zengjiayan and Guojielou, one route runs between Tongjielou and Caiyuanba, one route runs between Daxigou and Hualongqiao, and one route runs between Xiaoshizi and Shangqingsi. The stations along this route were originally part of the first route, but due to the excessive number of passengers on the first route, the fourth route was added to reduce congestion. For commercial aviation, there are two major companies, China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, both with regular scheduled flights. China National Aviation Corporation flies to Guilin, Hong Kong, Guiyang, Hanoi, Kunming, Luzhou, Xufu, Jiading, Wanxian, Yichang, and Chengdu. Eurasia Aviation Corporation flies to Guilin, Kunming, Hanoi, Chengdu, Hanzhong, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Ningxia, Liangzhou, and Xining. Postal services are under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Sichuan Administration Bureau, with a total of twelve branches distributed throughout the city, in addition to the General Bureau. The telegraph service has now been expanded to form the Sichuan-Kang-Tibet Telegraph Administration Bureau, with an average daily volume of over 1,800 telegrams sent and received, and approximately 7,000 telegrams relayed. International telegrams are usually transmitted via radio or submarine cable, and domestic telegrams are also often transmitted via radio due to line issues. For long-distance calls, in addition to military use,</p>
<p>the Great Buddha by the Jialing River can directly communicate with Chengdu, Shiyang, Neijiang, Jiajiang, Leshan, Qijiang, Wanxian, Liangshan, Changshou, Badong, Dianjiang, Fengjie, Nanwenquan, Kunming, Hong Kong, and other places. This spring, trial wireless telephone calls were also made with Dihua in Xinjiang and Lanzhou in Gansu, with good results, and it is expected that they will be open to the public soon.</p>
<h3>Salt Wells in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Huanlan</p>
<p>There is a common saying: "The seven necessities to begin a day are firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea." Although salt ranks fourth, its importance is no less than that of firewood, rice, or oil. Because everyone needs it, salt tax is a very important item in the national revenue.</p>
<p>Salt includes rock salt, lake salt, and well salt. Sichuan's salt comes from wells, called well salt. A few years ago, there were twenty-three salt fields in the province engaged in production. Statistics show that there were more than 8,800 salt wells, and there are many near Chongqing. Because the brine quality of well salt is weak, on average, evaporating about 20 jin of water is required to produce 1 jin of salt. At a time when fuel is expensive, the cost is also high. According to a report at the end of November this year, a certain chemical industry society introduced the Shinoda drying method from France and Germany and built drying racks, which were tested at the Niuhuaxi salt field with excellent results. This method can save fuel and allow for natural evaporation. It is said that each drying rack costs three to four thousand yuan, but if implemented throughout the province, it could save ten million yuan in fuel costs.</p>
<p>The picture shows a salt well in Chongqing. The wooden frame and wheel disc are the pulleys used to extract brine, which, as physics explains, use fulcrums to reduce labor.</p>
<h3>A Brief Record of Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Shaotang</p>
<p>Chongqing is located at 106 degrees 37 minutes 48 seconds east longitude and 29 degrees 35 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, with an elevation of 240 feet. It is situated at the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, surrounded by water on three sides and connected to land on one side. Strategists consider it a crucial point for both water and land routes, controlling Jing and Kui to the east, pointing to Chengdu to the west, leading to Qian and Dian to the south, and looking to Hanzhong to the north, making its terrain extremely important. In the Zhou Dynasty, it was the State of Ba, with a viscount of the Ji surname. During the Qin and Han dynasties, it was the territory of Ba Commandery. In the Jin Dynasty, it was renamed Badu. At the beginning of the Sui Dynasty, it was renamed Yuzhou. During the reign of Emperor Yang, it was renamed Yu Commandery. In the Tang Dynasty, it was renamed Yuzhou again. It was not until the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty that it was renamed Chongqing Prefecture. During the Yuan Dynasty, it was established as Chongqing Circuit. In the Ming Dynasty, it was renamed Chongqing Prefecture again, and this continued in the Qing Dynasty. In the early years of the Republic of China, the prefecture was abolished and replaced by a county. In the twenty-fifth year, a city was established. In the twenty-eighth year, it was changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan of the National Government. The total area of the city is 174 square kilometers. In the sixteenth year of Guangxu (Qing Dynasty), it was permitted as a treaty port due to the Sino-British Beijing Additional Treaty. In the twentieth year of Guangxu (Qing Dynasty), the Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan designated it as a commercial port.</p>

<h3>Scenic Spots in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Shaotang</p>
<p>Chongqing is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with many scenic spots. The most famous are the North and South Hot Springs. The South Hot Spring is about 40 li from the city. The water source comes from Jianyu Mountain, and the temperature is constantly maintained at 44 degrees Fahrenheit. It contains a lot of sulfur, so it can treat various skin diseases. In addition to the main spring, there are two small springs, one called Ziquan, located in Juewen Garden behind the hot spring resort. The water volume is very small and is not open to the public. The other is called Xiaowenquan, located on the left bank of Huatanxi Creek, about 3 li from the hot spring resort. The North Hot Spring is located in Wentang Gorge downstream of the Jialing River, 140 li by water from Chongqing. The land route is slightly shorter than the water route, only 79.5 kilometers. Tourists can take a bus from Qingmuguan to Beibei if traveling by land, and then take a tourist boat from Beibei Hot Spring Park to directly reach the North Hot Spring. The spring water emerges from the foothills in three streams. The temperature is slightly lower than that of the South Hot Spring, warmer in winter and cooler in summer, unlike the constant temperature of the South Hot Spring throughout the year. According to the chemical analysis results of the Western China Academy of Sciences, the highest temperature of the North Spring is around 37 degrees Celsius. The mineral content, especially lime, is slightly higher, but it can also treat skin diseases. Famous scenic spots near the South Hot Spring include Jianwen Peak. Legend has it that Emperor Jianwen of the Ming Dynasty once hid on this peak. There was originally a Jianwen Temple on the mountain peak, but it has been in disrepair for many years; most of the buildings in the temple have collapsed. Near the North Hot Spring is Gaokeng Rock, where waterfalls fly across. It is over a hundred feet high and nearly two hundred feet wide. People cannot approach within three zhang, making it the most magnificent scenery near the North Hot Spring. In addition, there are also the Twelve Scenic Spots of Bayu, such as Jinbi Liushui and Hongya Dicui, as well as gardens, villas, caves, temples, and other famous scenic spots, too numerous to mention, so they are omitted here.</p>

<h3>Wartime Work of Women in Chongqing—A Spirit of Service Exceeding That of Men—</h3>
<p>— Xinmeng</p>
<p>In the streets of Chongqing, one can often see teams of Chinese girls with sun-darkened faces and skin, singing military songs, with blankets and other items on their backs, marching in orderly steps. Under the leadership of Madame Chiang, their lives are disciplined and militarized. Among these women, 450 are from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The youngest is only fourteen years old, but she claimed to be fifteen in order to join the Women's Wartime Service Corps. They received military training in Hunan, and now, under the leadership of Madame Chiang, they are engaged in various wartime tasks. In the rear, they are responsible for teaching elementary school students how to sing military songs and how to take precautions during air raids, as well as participating in public gatherings,慰劳征人家庭, and improving relations between the people and the military.</p>
<p>On May 3rd and 4th, Chongqing suffered a brutal bombing by Japanese aircraft, resulting in a total of 5,000 deaths and 1,000 injuries. They participated in various rescue efforts, demonstrating a spirit of service that exceeded that of men. At the same time, near Chongqing, Madame Chiang established a New Life Textile Factory, planning to recruit 1,000 wives and daughters of servicemen, so that they would each have work. Initially, it is half-work and half-study, teaching not only textile skills but also subjects such as music, language, and arithmetic. After graduation, they implement cooperation and can purchase textile machines at half price, with installment payments. Military families can enjoy special discounts when purchasing goods from the factory.</p>
<p>Since the successive fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, at least 10,000 war orphans rescued from the war zones have been brought to Chongqing. The work of relief and education is entirely carried out by women's organizations. Currently, there are many women's organizations in Chongqing, but they are all unified and commanded by the highest women's movement organ. The weather is getting cold, and servicemen urgently need winter clothing, so recently, women in Chongqing have been busy sewing winter clothes. Under the leadership of Madame Chiang, considerable achievements were made in this work in Hankou, so this time it will naturally be no less impressive.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Chongqing</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chongqing Municipal Price Assessment Committee, it has been stipulated that the prices in Chongqing shall be based on the market prices on November 2nd of this year, and no increase shall be allowed thereafter. The standard price for high-quality rice is 16 yuan per dan, and the standard price for vegetable oil is 6.6 jiao per jin.</p>
<p>According to a survey by a foreigner named Stein in August of this year, 386 factories that had relocated from Shanghai and Hankou to the vicinity of Chongqing had 65,000 tons of machinery.</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, the Ministry of Education promoted social education work. In addition to establishing a wartime social education work corps to provide services everywhere, there are over 1,000 students in civilian schools and over 600 students in women's supplementary schools.</p>
<p>The largest air-raid shelter in the country is in Chongqing, capable of accommodating 10,000 people and equipped with air pumps and generators, etc.</p>
<p>The beggars in Chongqing have all been taken in and given military training.</p>
<p>There are twelve scenic spots and historical sites in Chongqing: Central Park, General's Tomb, Luohan Temple, Jiangbei Park, Liyuan Garden, Laojun Cave, Zhenwu Mountain, Nanshan Mountain, Huayan Temple, Laoying Rock, South Hot Spring, and North Hot Spring, etc.</p>
<h3>Four New Ministers</h3>
<p>— Guanqing</p>
<p>The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was recently held in Xindu, Chongqing. Regarding party affairs, four new ministers were appointed. One is the new Minister of Publicity, Mr. Wang Shijie, a native of Hubei, currently 48 years old. He graduated from Beiyang University at an early age and then went to the University of London in the United Kingdom to study economics, education, and political science. Later, he went to the University of Paris in France to study law and obtained a doctorate. After returning to China, he was hired as a professor of constitutional law at Peking University. In 1928, the Ministry of Education hired him as the president of National Wuhan University. He was serious in his work and was deeply appreciated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The following year, he became the Minister of Education. The academic community admired him for his integrity and hard work. He is the author of books such as "Comparative Constitutional Law" and "Chinese Slavery." In his youth, he was intelligent and diligent in his studies. During his studies abroad, various Western professors praised him for his quick thinking and studiousness. He is amiable and approachable, and he has been known for his integrity in politics and education.</p>
<p>The second is the new Minister of Organization, Mr. Zhu Jiahua, courtesy name Liuxian, currently 47 years old, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, with a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Berlin, Germany. After returning to China, he served as a professor at Peking University, Sun Yat-sen University, and National Central University, as well as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Minister of Education, Minister of Communications, and Chairman of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Directors (currently still in office). Mr. Zhu was handsome, erudite, eloquent, responsible, and public-spirited in his youth, and he is a cornerstone of China's young politicians.</p>
<p>The third is the new Minister of Social Affairs, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, a typical soldier and scholar, currently 51 years old, a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, born in Jiangxi. He studied in Japan at an early age and was a successful protégé of the Prime Minister. He served as a representative of Jiangxi Province to the National Congress in Nanjing and as a consultant to the Prime Minister. He then served as the Director of the Guangdong Public Security Bureau and Commander of the Military Police. His subordinates were known for their bravery, and were later reorganized into the 17th Division of the National Revolutionary Army. Later, he served as a member of the Central Legislative Yuan and Mayor of Shanghai. When the War of Resistance broke out, he was transferred to serve as the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. He is good at socializing and is enthusiastic about public welfare and charity. He is tall and has a bold demeanor. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek appreciates him as a versatile and artistic figure.</p>
<p>The fourth is the new Minister of Social Affairs, Mr. Gu Zhenggang, a native of Guizhou. He is very enthusiastic about party affairs and is courageous and responsible in his work. He has served as an alternate member of the Central Executive Committee, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, and Counselor of the Ministry of Industry. Mr. Gu is honest and hardworking in politics. He is unwilling to let others take the lead in any undertaking that benefits the party, the country, and the people, so the central government relies heavily on him.</p>
<h3>The Fog in Chongqing is Worth 30 Million</h3>
<p>Once Chongqing enters winter, it is shrouded in fog, which lasts until the early summer of the following year before clearing up. This fog has its disadvantages and advantages. The disadvantage is that when there is heavy fog, there is no sun, and the climate is very bad, making people feel extremely uncomfortable in such an environment. The advantage is that with fog, planes can easily get lost and are also afraid of hitting the surrounding high mountains, which could cause them to crash. Therefore, once winter arrives, there are not many Japanese bombers going to Chongqing. This is a natural weapon against air raids. When Senator Tao Xingzhi gave a speech in Hong Kong this spring, he said, "The fog in Chongqing is worth 30 million." His explanation was: To make Chongqing's air defense comprehensive, at least 100 anti-aircraft guns are needed, and if each gun costs 300,000, then 30 million would be needed. Once Chongqing has fog, the Japanese dare not bomb, so isn't the fog in Chongqing worth 30 million?</p>
<h3>Film and Drama in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Due to the war, several film companies moved from Shanghai to Nanjing, and then from Hankou to Chongqing. Famous movie stars of the past have now joined the Chinese spiritual mobilization, reducing their lifestyles to the bare minimum in terms of clothing and food. Actresses playing leading roles currently receive only 60 yuan per month for living expenses. They are extremely busy with various preparations, but they don't seem to care much about the salary. According to locals, the lighting in Chongqing is very bad, and film production sometimes comes to a standstill because of it. It is even said that dogs in Sichuan are terrified and bark wildly when they see the sun in Chongqing, so you can imagine that sometimes it is impossible to film because of the light.</p>
<p>However, some movie stars cherish their time very much, and even if they are not filming movies, they will use their spare time to do some work. Especially those who have performed in stage plays in the past join legitimate theater troupes and perform wartime dramas in Chongqing and neighboring towns to awaken the general public. Currently, there are many theater groups in Chongqing—professional, amateur, and organized by young students—all standing on the same front line to perform national salvation dramas and engage in theater movements, working quite hard, so there is almost always a theater group performing every day.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, foreign exchange has gradually tightened, and not only has the supply of photography materials decreased, but the price has also become very expensive, which has greatly increased the cost of filmmaking. However, film companies in Chongqing, especially "China Film" and "Central Film," are actively proceeding with filmmaking. All the films they shoot contain a sense of resistance. Currently, the films shown in large and small cities in southwestern China are all of this kind. Here, it is not difficult to see that the film and drama movement in Chongqing is being vigorously promoted!</p>

<h3>The Problem of Children's Crime</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai, known as an isolated island, has produced many war orphans. Although they are taken in and cared for by various charities, the number is too large to accommodate. Therefore, one can see wandering children everywhere in the streets and alleys. These poor children, some still have parents, but they became separated from their homes after the upheaval and scattered along the way. Some don't even have parents. Their lives are so miserable! Every day they wander the streets, scavenging, begging, and even committing theft. The wandering children who commit theft are certainly committing crimes, but because of their young age and lack of knowledge, and because they are under the legal age, the law usually deals with them leniently on the grounds of youth and ignorance.</p>
<p>However, the situation in the "History of Crime by Street Children" recently published in this newspaper is different. According to what was published the other day: "Shanghai street child Lin Meiyuan, thirteen years old, recently stole valuable items on Nanjing Road and was arrested and sent to court. The judge, considering that the child was young, transferred him to the Children's Protection Section of the Public Works Department. According to the child's own statement: his uncle Lin Changchun brought him to Shanghai from Duobo and taught him how to steal. He had to steal items, and the uncle sold them and spent the money himself. Sometimes when he didn't want to steal, his uncle would beat him until he submitted." This is truly outrageous! The child Lin knew that stealing was a criminal act and did not want to do it, but this rogue uncle insisted on instigating him, beating and coercing him for his own gain. The commission of this crime was entirely caused by the rogue uncle, who should be arrested and severely punished! And this child Lin is innocent by nature and capable of being reformed!</p>
<p>Stealing is an immoral and criminal act, let alone teaching ignorant children to embark on a path of crime, while oneself remains free from the law. This is an extremely heinous crime! However, there are adults in society who steal, and children learn from them. There are not many children like Lin who can awaken themselves and distinguish between good and evil. It is hoped that those responsible for society will guide children with pure natures onto the right path from an early age, so as to prevent them from becoming evildoers as adults and leading others to do the same.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhijun</p>
<p>Q: Why does the bitten area of peaches and pears turn yellowish-brown?</p>
<p>(A) Peaches, pears, and other fruits contain a lot of iron. After we bite off the skin, the iron comes into contact with the air and undergoes oxidation, thus changing color.</p>
<p>(Q) Why does hot water clean better than cold water when washing clothes?</p>
<p>(A) Particles of dirt often stick to clothes and skin with a film of oil. Hot water can soften and dissolve this film of oil in the water, making it cleaner.</p>
<p>(Q) Why does river water flow slower on both sides than in the center?</p>
<p>(A) The water on both sides is slowed down by the resistance of sand and soil on the banks. The water in the center has less resistance, so it flows faster.</p>
<p>(Q) Why does the sun appear larger in the morning and smaller at noon?</p>
<p>(A) In the morning, sunlight shines on the ground at a shallow angle, passing through a very thick layer of air before reaching the eyes. The light is no longer very strong. When our eyes receive this light, the pupils do not need to contract, so they appear larger. At noon, the sun shines directly on the horizon, and the layer of air it passes through is thinner than in the morning. The light shining on the ground is very strong. Our pupils must contract to receive this light, and after the pupils contract, things appear smaller. However, for everyday objects, because of visual perception, the pupils contract the same amount regardless of distance.</p>
<p>(Q) Why do flowers smell sweeter after rain?</p>
<p>(A) There are two reasons: (1) After it rains, the air is fresh, and the fragrance is noticeably stronger.</p>
<p>(2) After it rains, the pores in the flowers that release fragrance are washed clean, allowing them to release more fragrance, so flowers smell sweeter after rain.</p>
<p>(Q) Why do we still have to exert force when swallowing food?</p>
<p>(A) There is air in the stomach, and swallowing requires overcoming its pressure, so exertion is needed.</p>
<h3>Wildfire—Ming'er's Refugee Diary, Part 46—</h3>
<p>— Baizheng</p>
<p>Watching the sun rise gradually from the mountain crevice in the east and slowly sink behind the hills in the west, another day passed like this. Sleeping and eating, eating and sleeping, wasting the days away in a daze. The climate also changed from warm to warm with the days, indicating that winter was passing and spring was coming. The organisms on the ground, brewing their new lives from the dead corpses, slightly awakened and showed a glimmer of life.</p>
<p>Mountain peaks, the ground, among the hills, by the streams, everywhere there were remnants of tangled and withered weeds, dead branches, barren rice stalks, and withered old leaves. How pitiful! These relics of nature were not collected. Some decayed, others were trampled, all a desolate scene.</p>
<p>After this long winter, spring finally came. The withered grass and fallen leaves could not rot completely, nor could they be trampled all away; they still densely covered the earth, seemingly wanting to last forever, remaining in the vast wilderness. But as winter passed and spring came, their descendants grew again, but they were squeezed by the remnants, unable to move freely, giving their descendants a blow to their lives. The people in the village seemed to understand this very well. Naturally, when this time came, no one went into the mountains to chop firewood anymore, forming an unwritten law. If these tens of thousands of withered grasses were allowed to lie crisscrossed, and new grass grew on top of them in the future, it would hinder the fields they cultivated. If all these grasses were cut away, it would be no easy task. Therefore, during this lean time, there was a grand burning of the mountains.</p>
<p>In recent days, one could find posters plastered on the walls of the village's ancestral hall: Banning the burning of mountains, one is to protect trees, and the other is to reveal the targets of aircraft bombing. But let the posters be posted, the mountains cannot but be burned. This kind of lip service leaves people helpless.</p>
<p>It was a pitch-black night. Just after Ming'er's family finished dinner, they discovered a ball of blazing light at the foot of the mountain opposite their house, like a ball of fire rolling around in the surrounding darkness, appearing particularly dazzling. The ball of fire gradually rolled towards the mountainside, and its area also expanded. Sparks flew in all directions, and the tongues of fire licked the ground, blood-red, licking at what it wanted to devour. The light flickered, eliminating the darkness without a trace, recklessly doing what it wanted within its sphere of influence. The withered grass had already been dried by the wind and sun and was extremely dry. All it took was a spark to ignite it. A wisp of white smoke and flames transformed its withered yellow original appearance into a pile of black ashes, and a gust of wind drove it away to who knows where. The flames spread more violently, and the tongues of fire had an endless ambition, desperately expanding to the places nearby. The crackling of trees, the burning of weeds, and the roaring of flames, along with the shouting of the east wind, formed a symphony of nature. The flames devoured this large area of withered grass like a wild bull. It even spread to and set fire to a small hill. A bright glow illuminated Ming'er, who was standing in the house watching, very brightly, but the wildfire was still unstoppable, but in the end, it had its dead end. Soon it was extinguished.</p>
<p>The foot of the mountain became a scorched earth, seemingly having been baptized by artillery fire. Ming'er remotely thought of that beautiful land! He couldn't help but feel a burst of melancholy! The flames of aggression will eventually be extinguished! And new life can still be built from the scorched earth!</p>
<h3>The Donkey and the Nightingale</h3>
<p>— Krylov's Fable — Translated by Zhao Yilin</p>
<p>One day, a donkey saw a nightingale. He said to the nightingale, "My dear, listen to me: they say you sing very well, and I have long wanted to hear you sing, to see if what you sing is as good as they say?" The nightingale, hearing this, began to sing. It sang in various tones, melodious and harmonious, moving from one song to another. At one moment, the sound was extremely low, and the distant reeds echoed softly; at another, a delicate melody scattered through the forest, and almost everyone listened to these songs. A breeze blew, and the birds stopped; the cows lay down in the grass. The shepherd boy, listening to the song, also held his breath, smiling at the shepherdess as he listened.</p>
<p>Finally, the song stopped. Then the donkey bowed its head to the ground and criticized, "I found it very unpleasant to listen to! To be honest, no one who hears your singing will not feel tired. It's a pity you haven't heard our rooster crow; if you learned from the rooster, you could sing better..."</p>
<p>The nightingale, hearing this, ignored him and had already flown far away.</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf (11)</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>The dwarf, seeing that Ali had nothing to say, said again, "Dinner is ready, and they are waiting?" Ali turned around and saw a house over there, much larger than the others, its height just enough for her to bend over and enter. When she looked into the house through the window, she saw a long table, covered with a light blue cloth, on which were placed many delicate plates, and next to the plates were a knife, a fork, and a small blue glass. At both ends of the table were two large plates, steaming with a wonderful aroma, which wafted out of the window. Ali smelled the aroma and thought, "I don't feel hungry, but since they have invited me to eat, I might as well accept their hospitality, but I hope they don't ask me to eat pine nuts from the pine trees." The dwarf seemed to know what she meant and said, "They will definitely prepare something good for you to eat." Then he let out a sharp whistle, breaking the silence, and in an instant, the dwarfs in the whole village appeared before her eyes as if by magic, rushing into the house, but as soon as they entered the corridor, they stood on both sides, leaving a path in the middle. The dwarf from before bowed very politely and said, "Please come in."</p>
<p>Ali asked happily, "Do you all gather together like this when you have dinner? How interesting!" The dwarf replied, "Not always, only for public banquets. Please come in and sit down, girl." Ali then stopped speaking, lowered her head, and carefully prepared to enter the door, but suddenly, she heard another sharp whistle, which startled her. She looked up, but bumped hard into the lintel with a bang, which hurt terribly. Immediately, she was annoyed and shouted, "What—what's going on? Why did you whistle again for no reason, startling me? I—" She had no more to say. The sound of the whistle came again, waking Ali up; she had been dreaming.</p>
<p>Ali was dubious, not knowing whether she was awake or dreaming. She stared around, seeing only darkness, her body stiff and cold, and her head still throbbing, because she had just bumped into the old tree trunk. She composed herself, and then heard the sound of a whistle in the distance; it was the early-rising bird starting to sing. The dwarf's whistle that she had heard in her dream was actually the bird's call.</p>
<p>She sobbed to herself, "Oh! Oh! What am I going to do? Where is my body? How can I find my way back in this darkness? Oh, I know, it must be those blue dwarfs playing tricks and making fun of me, making me believe I am dreaming. I knew those dwarfs were also monsters; I shouldn't have followed them to the village." Then she sat quietly for several more minutes, half-asleep, half-awake, still crouching next to the old tree, as if wanting it to protect her. After more time had passed, her consciousness gradually returned, and she thought that sitting still was not a solution; she had to find a way to return to the small inn, thinking that her uncle and aunt were worrying about her, not knowing where she had gotten lost. Thinking of this, she almost burst into tears.</p>
<p>Poor Ali finally struggled to stand up, then remembered the book and umbrella she had brought. She reached out and felt the ground, and they were still by the tree. She hurriedly picked them up, tucked them under her arm, and staggered a few steps forward, thinking that if she walked out of the shade of the trees, it wouldn't be so dark. This did not disappoint her; after she moved away from the old tree, she did feel a little brighter, but the night was still dark, and she could not see a glimmer of dawn. In such darkness, finding a way out of the forest was not easy; she regretted having rashly entered the forest in the first place.</p>

<h3>Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>"The Eight Righteousnesses" depicts the history of the rise and fall of the Zhao family of the Jin Kingdom during the Spring and Autumn period. From Zhao Xuanzi to Zhao Wuzi, the Zhao family suffered repeated hardships, but were saved by righteous people, so they were preserved. The legend says that Cheng Ying painted the Zhao family's suffering and the righteous deeds of the eight righteous people into pictures, so that the Zhao family could see them and know the whole story. At that time, Zhao Wu was fifteen years old, strong and powerful. After seeing the pictures, he was able to take revenge. Kunqu often sings scenes such as "Trouble in the Court," "Striking the Dog," "Saving the Orphan," and "Viewing the Paintings," which depict this story. The "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan" performed in the Erhuang opera is based on the Yuan Dynasty zaju. The Yuanqu Selection has "Zhao's Orphan," which tells the story of Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu saving the orphan. The Erhuang opera starts from the two men's plan, without Han Jue's suicide in front and revenge in the back, so it is not a complete opera. If the whole play is not performed, it cannot be named "The Eight Righteousnesses" in general, but only "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan."</p>
<p>Now, the Pihuang opera only performs "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan" because the plot of saving the orphan is the best, extremely emotional, and the used wisdom is beyond human emotion. Cheng's wife can't bear to give up her swaddled child, and Chujiu implies that Cheng Ying must do it reluctantly. Compared to "Changing Children at the Execution Ground," Xu Ce kneels down, and Xu's family gives up her own child to be loyal. The tactics are like links, emerging endlessly. Cheng Ying exposes Chujiu first, one thing; and whips him personally, two things; the orphan is searched out by Tu Anjia in person (according to historical records, after Tu Anjia killed Zhao Shuo, Zhao Kuo, etc., he repeatedly searched Zhao Shuo's wife in the palace. Shuo's wife, the daughter of Duke Jin, gave birth to an orphan, and Shuo's wife prayed to heaven, ordering the child not to cry, and if there was a sound, the Zhao family would be cut off. Tu searched for a long time, and the child was silent, so he was spared. Tu continued to search urgently, and Han Jue was ordered by Tu to guard the palace gate. Cheng Ying carried the orphan out in a medicine box and was searched out by Han. Cheng cried and begged very sadly, and Han let him go and committed suicide. Now Tu's search is the third search. If the whole play is arranged, three searches for Zhao's orphan will be more interesting), making him not suspicious, three things; Chujiu dies with the fake orphan, making Tu relieved, four things; Cheng Ying and the real orphan return to Tu's mansion for upbringing, five things; the five plans are all beyond human emotion, so even if the Tu thief is ruthless, he doesn't realize he's in the drum.</p>
<p>In the play, Cheng Ying begs his wife to give up her child, even kneeling down and holding a knife to her throat, which is interesting, but this is the organization of the drama. According to the historical records, "Gongsun Chujiu falsely carried another infant and hid in the mountains." The fake orphan who died with Chujiu was the child of an unknown family, not Cheng Ying's own child. The play says that it is Cheng's child, which adds a lot of drama and makes it more intimate and outstanding. This is the best organization method, and it can be said that it is Cheng's own child.</p>
<p>The Erhuang opera also has a complete version of this play, with scenes of viewing paintings and revenge fifteen years after searching for the orphan. Tan school old student amateur actor Wang Yutian once recorded the Erhuang Yuanban lyrics of Cheng Ying in "The Eight Righteousnesses" on a Baidai Diamond phonograph record, "Hiding the orphan in the empty mountain, it has been fifteen years now, in my heart I only hate the traitor, who harmed the Zhao family like that, alas, my brother Gongsun gave his life, alas, I am half a hundred years old and have no son, if God opens his eyes three points, revenge will be avenged, and injustice will be redressed," which is the singing before revenge. (Wang Yutian's voice is sad and suitable for singing Erhuang tunes, most like the old Tan, and his skills are also good. He once went to sea to perform in operas and died in Tianjin at the age of only forty.)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Dahua Grand Theater is scheduled to open on the evening of the second day, presenting Miguel Lona and Judy Garland's "Meet Me in St. Louis." This afternoon at 7:30, the theater will host all sectors and preview the new film.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the four first-run Western film theaters in Shanghai are now completely under the jurisdiction of the Asia Cinema, so during the holidays, they no longer compete with each other as they did in the past, selecting and screening giant films that compete with each other. Now, the Dahua Grand Theater has risen up and won the premiere rights of MGM, which produces the most films every year, so the programming of the Daguangming and Nanjing theaters will have to be considered. (The Cathay is mostly attended by Western audiences, and the Da Shanghai has now implicitly lowered its level by half, so there is no problem.)</p>
<p>At the end of 1939, after "The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," another major event occurred in the drama world. That was the reorganization of the "Improved Civilization Drama." Veteran dramatist Wei Ruhui, Yu Ling and Zhou Yibai, etc., joined the Green Treasure Theater as screenwriters at the introduction of Gu Menghu. Since Tan Zhiyuan, Gu Menghu, Bai Hong, etc. first proposed the slogan of "Improved Civilization Drama," although they also encountered many setbacks, under the hard work of Gu Menghu, the Green Treasure Theater, which had always been regarded by the drama world as a civilization drama, actually established a sound foundation of a large audience. Recently, many dramatists have realized that striving for civilization drama is not a fall, especially to educate the ladies and grandmothers, they should break into the corrupt circle of life, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" Veteran dramatists such as Yu Ling and Zhou Yibai personally took the stage, which could also serve as a wake-up call for general patients with "shallow thinking."</p>
