<p>（香港）興寗電，華軍退出汕市後、現守庵埠至金沙市之綫、迤西與潮陽之錢形成包圍汕頭之外圍、日運來騎兵千餘、並甲車多輛、圖截斷華軍東路幹錢、昨庵埠激戰、日軍塲亡甚重、華方已派大軍三路赴援、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>潮安　華軍出擊部隊、於二十三晚克復庵埠梅溪、現雙方在庵埠西方之彩糖相持中、（二十三日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據今日華方消息稱、汕頭東市郊飛機塲一帶、戰事仍極猛烈、日軍塲亡甚重、非待再事增援、日軍決難進展、不僅在汕市郊外、戰事仍在相持中、同時在汕頭市內、巷戰亦在進行中、華軍皆以鋼骨水泥之堅固建築物爲壁壘、在衝要地點、架置機關槍、從事抗戰、因此日機對於汕市、仍在猛烈轟炸中、又訊日軍沿韓江乘汽艇開至菴埠者、曾冀圖於此登陸後、向西進展、但經一夜之猛戰後、日軍終於撤退、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今日此間接華方消息、汕頭東郊與飛機場附近、中日兩軍刻在作戰中、六月廿一日午後十時、汕頭潮州間之電話仍通、又據昨晨六時發出之華方電訊稱、汕頭華軍仍扼守城市內外陣地、旋聞與日軍巷戰中、日機四十餘架昨日輪流向汕頭轟炸十二决、直至昨晚九時、仍盤旋汕市天空投彈、同時另一股日軍、乘馬達艇循漢河譯音）前進、已抵汕頭北十二哩之菴埠、（廿三日路透社電）</p>
<p>潮安　汕頭華軍廿三晨自退出庵埠後、在西北郊佈防、十時許華軍突出擊、一時槍聲復起、日不敢戀戰退守街市、戰事旋歸沉寂、庵埠以北平靜無事、（廿三日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）據電訊所傳、日軍於前日晨藉飛機軍艦掩護、在汕頭附近强行登陸、向該市包圍前進、當經華駐軍奮勇抵抗、迄今劇戰仍在進行中、記者爲明瞭戰况及日人企圖起見、特往訪軍事當局、叩詢一切、據軍委會發言人聲稱、略謂此决日軍進犯汕頭、本在意料之中、華軍在該地一帶、早已預爲準備、嚴密佈置、故已予登陸日軍以意外打擊、現仍集中兵力、在汕頭附近、與之激戰、務期達成消耗日軍之預定目的、至於日軍攻佔汕頭、就軍事上之意義而言、已無價値、其主要企圖、固不在軍事而在經濟、允其以侵奪各國在太平洋沿岸之權益、排除歐美在中國之勢力爲主要目的、藉以遂其獨覇東亞之野心耳、總之、日軍最近所以不敢深入內地、祗在沿海各口岸大肆滋擾者、適足證明共爲深陷苦境之一種掙扎而已、華軍決將按照預定計劃、予日軍痛擊、而促其早日崩潰、（二十三日電）</p>
<p>潮安　進犯汕頭之日軍、二十二日分四路進犯、（一）由東湖進犯達濠、經華猛烈抵抗、斃日軍甚衆、旋日軍增援數百、以密集砲火轟擊、華軍因地形關係、至晚轉移達濠西岸、與日對峙激戰中、（二）日軍六百餘由四基圍進犯、現與華軍在新村·楊村（四基圍西北的四五里）一帶劇戰、（三）汕市東區崎碌飛機塲一帶、日軍雖以陸海空軍夾擊、華軍仍扼守陣地、日軍無法寸進、汕市至晚八時、仍在華軍手、（四）數度迂迴進犯庵埠之日軍步騎兵、經華軍迎頭痛擊、敗退後、複於二十二晚十一時許、以小汽艇二十餘艘、載日兵數百、沿江進襲、被華軍在梅溪（庵埠之東）截擊、雙方發生混戰、（二十三日電）</p>
<p>（香港）據今日汕頭方面傳來消息、汕市現安謐、華人已有返城者、外僑亦皆安全、又據今日由汕抵此之難民言、在廿一晨四十三十分時、汕市發生空襲警報、當有日機十七架對汕市四周防軍區域大施轟炸、直至清晨六時、麵包島（譯音）之燈塔處卽有日旗扯起、至晨九時、卽有日艦七艘出現於港口、至十時增至十艘、皆泊於美孚油棧之對岸、對汕市猛烈砲轟、美孚油棧處墜落榴霰片甚多、因有叙利亞籍雇員一名、爲散片所傷、至十時四十五分鐘時、市中卽有兩處起火、顯爲日艦砲轟之結果、至下午六時、華方卽將自來水廠炸毀、據稱其時日軍已進抵汕市郊外、嗣後日軍卽有小隊侵入、至翌晨全市始告淪陷、此時美艦「壁爾斯巴利」號泊於美孚油棧二號浮標、他國海軍陸戰隊皆未登陸、至星期四下午美艦「浦泊」號開抵汕市、艦長曾訪問日艦高級長官、此後汕市卽甚安靖、（廿三日美聯社電）</p>

<p>（重慶）經濟部因汕頭陷落之後、中國東部之重要海口、除寗波一口外、幾已盡落日人之手、爲防日方利用此等口岸、推銷日貨計、經濟部已搜集所有日貨之商標、彙印成册、准定分發全國各抵制日貨之團體、細爲鑒別、俾能作有效之抵制、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>日軍若圖侵入　內地必受鉅創</p>
<p>（重慶）重慶聯合日報今日社評稱、日軍近在各綫失敗、爲轉移國際間與國內之注意、乃決在汕頭登陸、須知日軍在汕登陸、並非擴大共在華取攻勢之行動、反而暴露日本之荏弱、日軍近在湘北·鄂南與晋南取攻勢、旣已失敗、戰事結束遙遙無期、乃決取此舉、中國軍事當局在汕潮區、已作必要之軍事準備、日軍得軍艦飛機之協助、或能在沿海一帶登陸、但欲達其目的、勢必作重大犧牲、日軍若圖侵入內地、則其冒險行動、將得重大之懲創、汕頭以西山脈綿延、而粵人亦以優秀戰士著稱、近數月後、汕潮區之村民、已經組織訓練、並備武裝、以防不測、此等强有力之自衛團、對於日軍前侵、將予以最堅强之抵抗、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）中國駐法大使顧維鈞昨對新聞記者聲稱、日軍佔據汕頭、對於中日戰事前途、並不發生影饗、顧氏宣稱、中國軍火自汕頭輸入內地者、爲數甚少、日軍佔據汕頭、對於獲得如「歐洲式」勝利目的、爲期仍遙、渠稱日軍勝利消息在報紙上喧染甚盛、然因華軍施用游擊戰略之得當、對於延長戰事、及消耗日軍能力、不受阻礙、渠稱「日軍對汕行動、無疑的乃日軍對港行動之先聲、對港行動、日軍覺時機已到、可隨時發動云、」（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>英海軍當局令　恢復港汕航運</p>
<p>（香港）此間英海軍當局已勸告英商各航業公司、恢復汕頭之航綫、日方雖請求外國船隻勿駛入汕頭港內、但英當局並不承認此項封鎖、英砲艦桑那特號及驅逐艦史考特號現均留泊汕頭港、以保障英國船隻不受他人之干涉、美艦波爾斯白雷號及敎皇號目下亦在汕頭、驅逐艦阿須維爾號雖已於今日開往鼓浪嶼、但準備於必要時駛往汕頭、英輸發羅米能號今晨抵港時、路透社訪員曾登輪視察、見由汕頭撤退者、祇英籍婦女二人、美籍婦女一人、及兒童三人而已、惟船上載有避難華人三百人、其中若干係屬英籍云、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（香港）據今日此間官方消息、日軍在汕頭所實施之封鎖、爲英方所不承認、故英國海軍當局已請英國船隻仍繼續開汕、從事貿易、此點可表示英方實有打開日方封鎖之決心、因英海軍已有此種勸告、故怡和之「佛山」號及太古之「江蘇」號、已定於星期日開汕、同時美國僑民、至今亦無撤退者、英國海軍當局現雖持沈默態度、但軍官多認英美對日方封鎖汕頭之答覆、態度顯然極爲强硬、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（香港）此間今日各報、僉以巨額標題、刋登英國拒絕承認日本封鎖汕頭爲合法之消息、據悉英國當局通知所有英國船隻、照樣保持與汕頭之航綫、今日英輪、「佛山號」卽爲遵照此項通知、循例駛往汕頭之第一艘、第二艘英輪訂於本星期日開往汕頭、（二十三日海通社電）</p>
<p>（香港）首批離汕外僑婦孺二十三晨抵港、英海軍當局下令、英輪繼續航行港汕、對日軍封鎖汕頭、決不承認、（二十三日電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國首相張伯倫向下院宣稱、英國當局得日方之合作、已準備撤退駐汕頭所有英國婦孺、張伯倫預告、英國擬採取任何必要辦法、以應付日本所提各國軍艦均須撤離汕頭要求、英國政府對日本要求「極爲關懷」、張氏對於「日軍侵襲外國在華利益、是吾企圖覇佔遠東」之質問、則答稱「余希望不致如是」、先前、張伯倫首相與外相哈里法克斯曁芙國陸海空軍領袖會晤、考慮日軍在華之新行動、英國政府發言人宣稱、倘日本繼續反英政策、「英國自當採取對策、英國地位、不能長此不明」、此際關於在華事件、英國政府與美國時時接觸、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於中國汕頭港局勢、此間海軍界人士頃宣稱、日本駐華海軍當局曾經「要求」各國艦船離開該處、並未提出哀的美頓書、此在英國決當予以拒絕、加之英美兩國在汕頭港利益相同、英國態度自益堅決、要之英國艦船旣在該港、決當逗留其地、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美國增派軍艦　赴汕保護僑民</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國駐亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾昨晚電告華盛頓當局稱、渠已拒絕日本所提美國兵艦撤離汕頭之要求、雅納爾致海軍作戰部部長李希大將電稱、渠已通告日本、謂美國在無論何處、必要時、當保護美國人民、雅納爾致日海軍通牒宣稱、「渠當努力適合渠之使命、藉以避免干與日本軍事行動、」該項通牒由美國駐滬總領事高斯提交之、此間美國海軍界鄭重聲言、雅爾大將所發宣言、與渠在一九三七年所發者、乃舊事重提、是時渠宣稱美國兵艦、在無論何處、無論何時、於必要時、有權保護美國在華利益、並擬繼續保護之、美國駐汕領事楊格、報告國務院稱、在汕頭美僑四十八人均安、（二十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>（香港）自昨日日方之哀的美敦書發出後、除已在汕頭之英艦「太納特」號與美艦」壁爾蒲利」號外、復有外艦二艘駛入汕頭港、此卽美艦「浦的」號與英艦「司谷特」號是也、聞自日軍佔領汕頭後、卽推陳覺民爲維持會長、又據衛利韓輪船公司之發言人稱、昨日日方曾圖於該公司之碼頭登陸、認爲招商局之碼頭、經該公司告以此非招商局之碼頭、而爲衛利韓公司之產業、日軍若欲於此登陸、則將視爲破壞外人之權益、勢將提出抗議、至是日方始行作罷、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於日本駐華海軍當局要求美國艦船退出汕頭港事、美國駐亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾大將、已予拒絕、此項複文、乃由美國駐滬總領事高斯轉致日方、頃在此間發表其全文、略謂「日本當局曾經宣佈該國海軍將對中國汕頭港開始行動、並通告各國僑民與軍艦離開該港、關於此事、應請貴總領事通知日本駐滬領事、請其轉達該國海軍高級當局云、美國駐遠東各軍艦之職責、首在保護美國僑民、不論何處、凡有此必要時、美國軍艦卽當駛往共地、要之美國旅華僑民一日需要保護與援助、美國軍艦卽當一日留在中國各港口、」喬治亞洲民主黨衆議員文生（衆院海軍委員會主席）頃加以評論云、余對雅納爾大將此項答詞、完全表示贊同、美國公民一日僑居該處地方、政府卽一日負保護之責、」渥海渥州共和黨衆議員伏利斯宣稱、余以爲吾人倘能堅持到底、日本終必退讓云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本海軍當局曾經要求美國軍艦離開汕頭港、爲美國駐亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾大將所拒絕事經海軍部頃予以蹬實、並悉美國驅逐艦「畢爾斯堡萊」號、非特不擬離開汕頭港、有如日方所提要求、且另一驅逐艦「波浦」號、甫經駛抵汕頭港、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日外務省治態　度已漸趨軟化</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省發言人今日宣稱、日本請各國撤離汕頭之警告、係「友善之建議」、並非如各外報所稱之哀的美敦書、蓋日本海軍當局鑒於在現存局勢下、有謂外國船艦離開汕頭之必要、藉免發生不幸事件、其實勸外艦離開汕頭、並非規定外船不能停靠汕頭（二十三日海通社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此間日官方表示、日海軍成不再事要求外國軍艦離開汕頭、據日發言人向美聯社記者云、此决日方「請求」已被「誤會」、蓋日方謂求外艦離開汕頭、目的係避免在港內發生過於擁擠之意外事件也、記者問日方是吾因英美拒絕而軟化、日發言人認爲不確、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>

<h3 id="c2">汕頭登陸之分析觀 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>日本軍陽之在中國汕頭登陸，本報尚未置一辭。蓋汕頭雖爲中國之海口，然內離主要之陣地窎遠，交通維艱；外有日艦窺伺，雖外輪亦不免於檢查；故自始未嘗取爲輸入軍火之路綫，亦即得失無關軍運。中日決戰，允不在沿海。就經濟言之，依汕頭爲生者，雖非少數，然中國生機，方以內地爲根據；爲保全國力而限制外匯外貨之漏巵，孜孜惟恐不及；是以海口淪陷，適以助長限制之功能，推進內地之生產。斯以抗戰全局視汕頭，固無足重輕者也。顧國際論壇，頗因汕頭而騷動：大抵英法美輿論，視此爲新刺激；德義爲日本張目，而奢陳其爲大穫；日軍允「吹聽」之，謂軍事價値如何，經濟價値如何，政治意義允如何如何。夫一城一池之得失，當然不容抹煞之如無物；顧謂得失汕頭將有多大關係者，則日本挾海空二軍之長，取此濱海彈丸之地，誠所謂易如探囊；乃作戰將及兩年而始出此，此足反證初無多大關係。雖然，此在日本方面，則有其可資稱述之成功；且事僅三日，彼旣以「求仁得仁」而充分獲致所求。彼求不在此城此池，蓋一片焦土，得之何益；亦不在軍事經濟政治，謂此而有何價値與意義，乃是欺人之談；所求乃爲宣傳資料，茲得之矣，亦儘量宣傳之矣，內以慰彼軍民，外以眩示英法美德義；此其爲成功，不可諱也。</p>
<p>彼何爲而蘄求告慰軍民之宣傳資料？何爲蘄求目前之宣傳資料而重增今日軍力分散，今後孤軍難保之憂？此非吾人所欲詳爲註解；要之彼於匝月以來，損兵於晋西，折將於鄂北，宣傳資料亦確是難得，則求之汕頭，自有其苦衷。况乃藉此眩示他國，固一舉兩得也。抑何爲而眩示他國？此有二義：日本與德義軸心，同牀異夢，貌合神離。德義最欲借重於日本者，厥爲歐洲發生戰事之日，日本竭其海陸空之實力，與德義立於一條戰綫；不然，德義無取於日本。日本最忌憚者，在海爲美國，莫能助日抗美，故惟媚美；在陸爲蘇聯，此則願結德義以防蘇；除此而外，不願對歐洲未來之變局，因與德義有何的束，而徒爲德義工具。三國軍事同盟之說，雖經多方策動，卒無成議者，日本與德義之願望不同耳。然國際大勢，日本旣漸陷於不利，則謀所以勾結德義者，要在避免牽入歐洲漩渦，而不與德義締結廣泛之軍事同盟；同時又亟需德義爲彼聲援，專爲對付遠東與蘇聯而成立何種協定；因此條件之矛盾，乃必以若干事，眩示德義；俾德義承認日本在遠東之所作爲，乃間接有利於德義在歐洲之活動，用以促德義接受日本關於三國締盟之建議。彼之封鎖天津英法租界，與登陸汕頭，意義蓋在於斯，此其一也。國際之縱橫捭闔，虛實殊無常軌；故各國一面竭力提高一己之實力，以爲制勝之張本；一面造爲種種威脅之虛聲，以冀制勝於實力之外。理智之倫，雖論斷於虛聲之無效，然至目前爲止，任何人不敢斷言於懦怯者之必不屈服於虛聲。緣是之故，英法美諸國雖於日軍在汕頭登陸之後，顯示强毅之反應；然在日本發動登陸之初，固滿望英法美之不勝威脅而漸趨軟化；北天津，南汕頭，倒行逆施，變本加厲，眩示英法美以進攻之決心，此其二也。</p>
<p>對此情况，我人深信英法美不致變更政策於威脅之下，故得斷言於日本虛聲威脅之爲徒勞；然我人亦以爲日本必不以他國之表示憎惡而放棄其侵略，故得斷言於英法美空言抗議之無效！至於運命之判斷，惟視實力之行動；日本實力之不足取勝，自無可疑，然儘彼步步安排，而不急起直追，作有效之應付，則萬一更有何種意外之變局，亦有足使他國措手不及而遭其荼毒之可能，如以瓊島對越南，以汕頭窺香港，凡今日之貌似虛聲威脅者，皆得以萬一之機會而作意外之運用，是則大可注意者也。</p>

<p>縣爲自治單位、縣政府爲一切政令推行之基本核心、過去因上級機關之不統一、於是一縣之內、獨立機關過多、或則縣長另兼一名義、而事樓不一、經費浪費、矛盾摩擦、均由此生、現本省旣已一律裁局改科、本年度復將各縣司令部裁撤、改爲軍事科、併爲縣政府之一部、縣長仍兼司令名義、副司令兼軍事科長、以便執行團隊之指揮、而軍事行政、固已與一　般縣政相合一、所惜各項單行法令及事關中央法令者、一時尚未能辦到完全集中、而縣長依法例兼之職街、尚在二十個左右、</p>
<p>（二）行政經費、專員公署兼區保安司令部、及甲種縣政府、依照省定編制概算、全數由省庫支撥、乙種縣政府之行政經費、其數額依縣等有差、向例省庫對各縣行政經費、亦有撥補、其撥補數亦係視縣等高低而不同、因以一等縣本爲大縣、地方富力較優、省撥補數亦較多、二三等縣本已貧瘠、撥補數反較少、偏枯如此、自難以求平均發展因於本年度其、各縣行政經費數額、隨仍視縣等規定、而省撥補數、則改視該縣地方收入數額爲準、凡一縣地方收入在三十萬元以上者、其縣政府行政經費、全數由縣支出、不予撥補、在二十五萬元以上三十萬元以下這、就該縣政府行政經費總額、省款撥補五分之一、十萬元以上、二十五萬元以下者、省款撥補四分之一、十五萬元以上二十萬元以下者、省款撥補三分之一、十萬元以上十一五萬兀以下者、省款撥補一分之一、五萬元以上十萬元以下者、省款撥補三分之二、五萬元以下者、概由省款撥給、計全年由省款撥補之縣行政經費、共爲一百十二萬一千零力十三元、較之上年度共增三十四萬一千五百七十三元、區署經費純爲縣款、惟戰區獲接近戰區縣份、亦有由省撥補者、昔各縣每將區署經費列入自治經費項下、實係誤解區署之性質、近已隨時予以改正、飭列入行政經費</p>
<p>各縣鄉鎭保甲之經費、過去多恃各縣之自治戶捐、其捐率最低爲每月一角或每年一元、最高每月不得過三元、雖亦曾訂有籌集編查各辦法、但編查欠公、徵收繁擾、允以鄉鎭長自收自用爲最大流弊、自本年度起、爰將各縣之自治戶捐飛出、另按照田賦普通營業稅制標準、徵收自治經費二成存入省庫、由省統支、全年的可共收一百零九萬六千三百六十六兀、另由省庫撥十萬餘元、共足成一百二十萬元之數、以二十萬元抵補原有自治戶捐中體用之義務教育經費、另一百萬元、按各縣鄉鎮保數、分配撥用、其民國二十叫年度以前民欠自治戶捐、一律豁免、二十五六七年度欠額、准在本年六月底以前收淸、逾期亦予免除、以卹民艱、過去自治戶捐之按戶微收、實拘於保甲係以戶爲單位、其實在鄉村之中、按戶按地、負担者同而按地反較爲公平、現各縣另尚有按田畝微收之自治附捐一種、全省年共的五十萬元、將來亦擬併入省自治經費、統盤收支、</p>
<p>（三）行政用人、關於縣長之考試甄別、係屬中央職權、省政府未便辦理、民政廳已辦理者爲二十七年度縣長考績、値此抗戰時期、自必對於軍事方面多所注重、計考績之內容、爲民政·財政·建設·教育·保安·會計·司法·兵役·社訓·抗敵自衛·國民工役、各估百分數有差、現各主管機關已先後將分數送到、即可開始計算總分、惟縣長於考續日到任尚未及三個月者、依章不在考績之內、各縣佐治人員之任用、抗戰後幾完全授權於縣長、除會計人員因超海主計制度、由省會計處逕派外、即向由省委之警察局長警佐、亦皆改出縣長自行報委、惟其中因銓叙審查之停頓、各縣用人不免雜亂、戰時縣長之職權、固應提高、而國家之法令、亦不能違背、故本省銓叙委託審查委員會、業經恢復工作、甄審省以下各級行政人員、一方面培養新幹部人員、使有所取才、得資保障、另再訂定各項整飭辦法、務期矯正斯項陋習、</p>
<p>（四）民政廳主管之工作民政廳主管之各項工作、除已於上述三節中有所論述者外、關於糧食之管理、於去年秋間奉省府令、移於建設廳、本年複另置戰時糧食瞥理委員會、由主席任主任委員、</p>
<p>關於振濟之行政、本省已置浙江省振濟會辦理、惟關於救濟事　款產之整理、省立貧兒院之管理、仍奉省府決議、由民政廳主辦、又近奉中央振濟委員會令知、關於社會救濟事業、仍由民政廳隨時策動列爲經常不斷之工作、所有災振等事項、概須由民政廳策動運用及輔導、此似與中央頒發之省振濟會組織規程第四條、有所衝突、現正呈請解釋、如何劃分權限中、關於兵役、則壯丁之調查管制、出徵軍人家屬之優待、及縣辦理兵役人員之管理、雖仍屬於民政廳主辦、而於兵役之徵送、各縣兵額之配賦、國民兵之編組训練、及納金緩役、係屬於軍管區司令部主管、惟關於兵役法令之解釋、則仍會同辦理、關於警政及禁烟禁毒、一本諸中央法令辦理、由杭州退出之省會警察局及省警察敎練所員警、大部改組爲抗衛支隊、担任國防任務、內河外海兩水上警察局、亦已眞接參與作戰、</p>
<p>至若戶籍地政積　衛生各項工昨、民政廳深致主義、亦已分別　施矣、</p>

<p>世界是在日益進步中的、自然、社會的任何事物、也都是在跟着改良發明和進展的當中、即如呢質的夏料呢、在眼前上海所風行着的、畢竟也有多種了、醫如據我所接觸到的、像派立司呢凡而丁、（應市已有稍具歷史）靑灰和糙米色的直貢、最特色的還有種呌做「網眼呢」的</p>
<p>派立司呢、在市上的別類很多、質地亦極有高下、在年前日貨異常活躍、價値亦最低廉、僅四五元一碼、故一時簡直連派立司長衫也風行異常了、自滬戰　發、日本因原料缺乏、故日貨已稍星「退潮狀、」且價亦不再如前時之廉、隨之而起、足可欣喜的、國產派立司、也稱活躍、價亦在六七元之間、此外也有上海怡和廠出品的、但其質地與價格最高昂的、當推「英國來路貨」了、價値一般在十元左右、顏色有米·黃·灰等、都有深淡多種、</p>
<p>凡而丁同樣是完全毛織的All　wool）顏色有米·灰·白棕綠·莊·元·等甚多、市上除英貨外、也有其他國家的冲貨、但以毛質關係、英貨最算細潔、價七八元間、去年今年、銷行極廣、今年如米·莊·灰·元色者）尤爲暢銷、幾皆無貨矣、</p>

<p>— 晟</p>
<p>戰前，金華在浙贛鐵路上佔有極重要之地位。自戰事發生以後，難然受到相當的威脅，但是始終還是握着交通的重心。據最近接到金華的通訊，那兒的交通狀况，仍然是很暢通的，現且分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）公路　自金華通往各地的公路，計分金溫，金甬，金徽，金衢四綫。金溫錢以靑田爲終點，計長一百九十五公里半，行程一天，中途可以在麗水午餐，晚間即在靑田住宿。决日自靑田改搭小划船先到溫溪，再換輪就可以抵達溫州了。金華麗水問的車票，快車國幣五兀，慢車四元二角。自麗水至溫州，聯票三兀五角，包括麗水到溫溪的划船和自溫溪到溫州的小輪。金甬綫以溪口爲終點，長二百五十五公里餘，行程一天半，午在長樂午餐，晚在新昌住宿，到了溪口，就可以乘赴髯波的輪船到甬。票價金華到長樂幽幣五元四角二分，長樂到嵊縣，國幣一元，嵊縣到新昌一元，新昌到溪口二元一角，由溪口到寗波的輪船二元三角。金微綫是以威坪爲終點的，全長一四六·五八公里，行程一天半，中途要在蘭谿住宿，第二天在威坪午餐，下半天就可接安徽的公路汽車到屯溪了。由金華到蘭谿的票價爲八角，由蘭谿到威坪的票價叫元零五分，由威坪至屯溪之票價爲四元一角。金衢綫是以衢州爲終點，長只九十九公里，行車三小時半，票價國幣二元七角五分。各綫的免費行李，每人祗准携帶二十公斤，超過時每十公斤（或不滿十公斤）每公里加收運費四釐。</p>
<p>（二）鐵路　現在浙贛路不能全段通車，如目金華登車，可以到達諸暨，蘭谿，龍游，衢縣，江山，玉山，上饒，弋陽，貴溪，鷹潭等處。特快車之三等票價，自金華至龍游一元西角，至衢縣二元二角五分，至江山三兀二角五分，至玉山四元三角，至上饒五元三角五分，至弋陽六元五角五分，至貴縣七元一角五分，至鷹潭七兀七角。普通車自金華至諸暨二元六角五分，至蘭谿四角五分，至龍游一元二角五分，至衢縣二元一角，至江山二元九角五分，至玉山四元，至上饒四元九角，至弋陽六元一角，至貴溪六元七角，至鷹潭七元一角。二等車照上面的價錢加倍，頭等事加二倍，三等旅客每人祗准帶行李四十公斤，超出者每十公斤每公里照加運費一釐。二等旅客准帶免費行李六十公斤，頭等准帶八十公斤。</p>

<p>— 洵</p>
<p>關於川滇東路之大概情形，曾於本刊第十一期有簡略之記載，最近有某君由昆明至瀘州，親自調查，所得該路情形，頗爲詳細，用再記述於下：</p>
<p>川滇東路起自昆明，經滇省曲靖，宣咸；黔省威寧，赫章，畢節，赤水河，川省叙永而達瀘州，全綫里程，共畏九一二·七〇公里。由瀘州過沱江，有公路可達川南之隆昌，在此啣接成渝公路，該段共畏六十二公里，亦爲川滇公路之一段。</p>
<p>全路工程概況</p>
<p>可分四段，其情形如後，</p>
<p>（一）自昆明至宣威止，計二五八公里，所有路面橋楔，涵洞等工程，均早吿完成，路面平坦堅實，載重車輛，可以行駛。雲南省公路局已在運車營業，</p>
<p>（二）自宣威至城寧止，計一七九公里，本年五月初，該路路面方吿完成，路面尙未動工，橋樑涵洞，均在建築中。開山工程，尙未結束，便道甚多，天雨不能行車，目前情形載重車輛，絕不可冒險行駛。該路完成之期，依據工程推進情形，預測約在七月第左右。</p>
<p>（三）自威寧起至赤水河止，計二六三公里，工程方面，均已完成，可行駛車輛。</p>
<p>（四）自赤决河至瀘州止，計二一〇公里，路面已吿完成，惟開山工程正在推進中。在此興工期內，行車頗感困難，且其中少數橋標，亦未完成，行車須經便橋·現交通部西南公路局設有改善工程處，擬着手巡行，除橋標外，其他工程，在七月底以前，或可完工，照目前情形，載重車輛，亦不宜行駛。</p>
<p>渡口：</p>
<p>若運輸車輛，自昆明起，至瀘州止，須過波四决。若在藍田　止，祇須過波三次。照目前各機關與商行車輛，均以籃田壩爲終點；故來日運輸水輛，紙須過波三决，計七星關，赤水河，永寗河，等三處，</p>
<p>車站設置：</p>
<p>川滇東路除瀘州至隆昌外，昆明至瀘州，計長九百餘公里，似應分別設站，以利管理。全路除昆明，瀘州，爲規定值起讫站外，中途擬設曲靖，宣威，　脚，威寗，赫章，畢節，赤水河，叙永等八站·其中以宣威，咸寗，畢節，叙永，爲宿站，曲靖，　脚，赫章，赤水河爲膳站</p>
<p>行程及里程：</p>
<p>該路行程，可分爲五天，第一日由昆明至宣威（二五八公里），第二日由宣威至威寗（一七八公里）；第三日由威寗至畢節（一七五公里）：第四日由畢節至叙永（一八四公里）；第五日由叙永至瀘州（一一八公里）。</p>
<p>駁運。</p>
<p>該路目前尙無駁運，西南運輸處，及交通部駁運管理所，現正擬着手進行。</p>
<p>通車時期：</p>
<p>全路除昆明至宣威，成髯至赤永河二段路面橋樑，涵洞均已完成外，其餘赤水河至瀘縣間橋樑等未完成者甚多，開山工程，亦在興築中。單行道，便道時有遇到，允以宣威至威寗間一七九公里，路面尙未開工，天雨不能行車，觀察工程方面推進情形：及各縣政府暨各工程處之調査，可以通行載重車輛之期，的在本年七月底左右也。</p>

<p>— 石也</p>
<p>近閱報載梧州通信，最近桂省府與欽廉守備司令部商定一種統制交通計劃，組織物資聯運站，發動各地之公路職員，碼頭夫，車夫，挑夫，共同組合集團，辦理運輸事宜。其統制管理，由政治部主持。現粵南方面，自北海起，以迄廣西之橫縣止，首先成立物資聯運站，在橫縣及北海各設立總站。由橫縣經南鄉，靈山，武利，合浦，以達北海，凡各大墟市，均設立分站。各總分站之管理聯運人員，由原有公路職員充任。每一站均有碼頭夫，車夫，挑夫等之設備，共計雇用苦力工人，的三千餘人，各聯運站隨時可以代辦客貨運輸，逐站送至目的地·其發動此種物資聯運之目的：一爲從事戰時運輸事業，使一切貨物輸運，不因戰事而受影響，並不因公路破壊而停滯。二爲維持後方交通，解決失業員工生活。三係杜絕出入口私梟走運私貨瞞騙政府稅收。</p>
<p>觀夫上述消息，桂省此種物資聯運之組織，共目的之正當偉大，固已足使吾人敬服，而疏通貨運及解決失業員工之生活兩點，允爲當務之急，引起吾人以深刻之注意。因憶及兩月前，會有自渝滇返滬之旅客之片段談話，內有，滇渝交通，雖暢通無阻，行旅稱便，惟因車輛缺乏，貨運方面，極感因難。由滬港等處運往內地銷售之貨物，屯積於昆明貴陽諸地者，多如山積，一時頗難疏通。惟由昆明至四川三敘府，已有公路可通。當局爲節省汽油計，以馬車運貨，馬由小隊壯丁押運，並以每三十公里爲）驛站，預計需時叫十二日可達，正在試辦，成續尙佳·又以前舊有馱運，每馬馱貨八十公斤，信用可靠，惟運費亦高，昆叙間四十日可達，倘貨物屯積而無法起運者，採用此法，亦聊勝於無也，等話。按現在運往內地之貨物，均取道海防，經昆明，貴陽，以達重慶，公路車輛，既感缺乏，貨運困難，當爲必然之勢。今果據返滬旅客之談話所述之馬車運貨，與鴃運兩項而論，以叙昆間之邋輸，雖均達四十日之多，不能不謂過久，然較之屯積不疏，終勝一籌，且舊有鴃揮，均係私人經營，組織不全，人手缺少，其成績當較遜色，倘渝滇當局，能注意及此，亦仿照桂省物資聯運站辦法，利用此項馬車與馱運，爲運輸工具，從事健全其組織，推動大批馱夫，車夫，挑夫，苦力及失業員工，實行官商合作之解決貨運總動員。四十日之行期，或能减爲三十日，乃至二十日，八十公斤之馱馬，每批或可增其欺量，而儘量疏通。</p>
<p>此種辦法，初視之，或過近於理想，但主持者果能本桂省物資聯邋站之精神，迅予改良此種馱運，使其成爲戰時運輸之利具，不獨輸運恃以疏通，而大批失業工員，能因之以維持其生計，造福人羣，常允非淺鮮矣。</p>

盡艱辛，而其志曾不稍懈，故收效之速，有非公始料之所及者焉。公來滬第二年，敎化大行，更以得同會賈公宜陸P.　Le　Gravina之臂助，授洗一千一百二十四人，翌年即昨新信友一千二百四十人，四鄉敎外聞風來歸者日益眾。崇明名醫徐啟元懸壺滬上，於公到由後之第一年中，領洗奉敎；至是，乃邀公赴島上開敎，西士之傳敎崇明，自公始。公留崇未久，而歸化者亦殊不少。一六四一年滬民苦旱，繼又飛蝗為厲，田禾縱不枯槁，亦將為蝗食盡。而是時倭寇正熾，沿海居民，屢遭劫掠，更苦不堪言，鄉愚迎神賽會，顧皆祈福無靈，信眾則守齊克苦，虔誠誦禱，惟求上主保全，果蒙垂允。信眾於歡欣鼓舞，熱忱百倍，至欲將鄉間所有淫祠妖廟，悉予搗毀，公力阻乃已。徐文定公旣誶於北京，其家護喪南下回籍安葬，出殯日，公為領葬，官紳信眾臨執紼者數百人，禮儀極隆重，歷三日始竣事；旣葬，公乃以耶蘇會全體名義，書拉丁文作銘，譯成華文置墓中。　　越三年，流賊陷京師，懷宗殉國，吳三桂引淸軍入關遂賊，滿人遂乘機據帝都，進窺中原。及弘光卽位金陵，淸兵南下，江南因以大亂，滬地適當要衝，受禍尤烈。　　淸軍南下之際，蘇滬大遭蹂躪，居民遷徙他鄉，而公始終不願辭其職守，仍專心致力於照料信眾，傳敎化人，上主鑒其勤勞，特加護佑，敎務益形發達，信友人數，與年俱增。計公傳道至一六六五年楊光先誣陷湯公（若望），公與各省敎士二十五人盡皆被逐回澳之際，松屬七縣城鄉，已建敎堂六十六所，信友達五萬餘人，而去世時則更增至九十公堂，四十五經堂，至奉敎人數之增加，尤當以江南為首屈一指。蓋一六四八年一年中，公付洗一千一百四十二人，而觀於公於一六六一年致聶公格爾P.　GorinNikel之書，謂年來敎外人士之歸化聖敎者，幾必在二三千人以上，亦可以見當時之盛況為何如矣。顧公以十餘年之建樹，其一切事業所以能臻若是之偉且大者，固由於公熱心毅力舉措得宜，成立各種善會，使信友中之傑出者有德者，分任救靈工作，收事半功倍之效，然亦有賴乎文定公孫女，許母徐太夫人甘第達之力為不少焉。緣甘弟達自幼熱心敬主，年十六于歸松江許姓巨紳，生有子女八人，以善言德表，感化合家奉敎，越十四年而夫亡，益修德務善，訓子女俱成熱心敎友。長子纘曾洗名巴西略，少年登第，累官至河南按察，任職江西湖廣時，纘曾皆奉母赴任，太夫人所至之地，協助該處司鐸傳敎，不遺餘力，南昌武昌等處，皆有其所建之敎堂。其後還鄉，更捐助巨貲於江南各屬，修建大小聖堂三十餘所，尤樂善好施，貧人恃以存活不可勝數，又籌募鉅款，創立育嬰堂於松江蘇州二處，一時好善富紳聞風興起，無不踴躍捐輸，共襄義舉。公來江南，甘第達叩囑其父驥與子纘曾，分函蘇松寗滬各當道，請其保護。一六六五年遘楊光先之難，各省敎士，奉旨拿獲，解京審解，上諭傳至江南，公方在滬，以當道夙善公，得旨並不拘押，聽公自行人才擇日起程，晉京候處，七月十八日，公等抵京師，寄居東堂。各省敎士，已陸續到齊，當是時，傳敎中國之西士，都三十一人，計耶蘇會士二十五，多敏我會士四，方濟各會士一〇公等居東堂二月，禮部請旨處斷，奉旨押解來京之敎士，但遺發廣東交該省總督看管。公等遂於翌年二月底廣州，圈禁城內耶酥會老堂，不准出城，亦不准傳敎。一六七一年湯公寃獄蒙昭雪，帝尋准南公懷仁之請，許被禁廣州之敎士還復自由。公知蘇松兩郡各屬敎堂，以得地方官保護，俱無恙，信眾亦皆安善如常，故決重來滬上，繼續傳敎。然公是時以積勞日久，精力已衰，且夙患胃疾，十八年來發劇恒作，痛苦難堪。暮年公所食益菲，體乃益弱，至是整裝待發，遽爾一病不起，一六七一年四月二十五日，公卒於廣州，卒後，言公德望將公遺骸運往上海安葬。殯葬之日，信眾舉哀執紼者不知紀數，亦以見公遺愛在民焉。墓在滬城南門外聖墓堂。　　自潘國光司鐸故世後，柏應理及畢嘉二公扶潘公棺來上海，然不一年，即康熙十一年（一六七二年）畢公奉旨赴陜西西安，柏公則往松江，是時留上海傳敎者有劉迪我Le　Fovre金百鍊　Emman　de　pereira二司鐸；於一六七六年同柏畢二公來滬者也。一六七六年一月二十八日劉公卒，柏公於是重來上海主劉公之喪事，祔葬於潘先生之左正昭位，并為之立石，題其墓曰：「泰西天學修士聖及劉公之墓。」柏公到上海後，又至崇明（一八七七年），巡視敎務，一六八〇年則返廣州，為至羅瑪述職故也。柏公去，在上海傳敎者，有張安富Posateri及金百鍊二司鐸。張公於一六七八年到上海；金公則於一六八一年（康熙二十年）五月十八日在上海故世，葬於上城南聖墓堂。　　金公卒後駐上海者惟張安當司鐸一人，一六八二年，管理八千多敎友。一六八七年聖伯實祿聖保占禮羅文羅主敎在上海行聖祭。羅主敎者吾國第一任國籍主敎，福建福寗羅家巷人，生於一六一四年，一六八五年四月八日在廣州城外祝聖為南京主敎，是年七月初一日到南京上任；此次到上海恐非第一次焉。　　羅主敎此次到滬，感傳敎士之缺乏，故於一六八八年八月一日祝聖三位中國耶穌會士為司鐸，即萬其省，吳歷，劉蘊德。吳歷號漁山，江蘇常熟人，祝聖司鐸時，年已五十八，後回滬，助張魚傳敎於上海嘉定間，一七一八年二月二十四日卒，安葬於城南聖墓堂。　　張安當於康熙三十一年（一六九二年）離上海至山西陜西傳敎，一七〇五年卒於太原。上海之敎務由孟山義司鐸Emman.　Mendes　接管。孟公於一六八四年曾一度到上海，繼到江西傳敎，吳漁山司鐸卒（康熙五十七年）後為之立墓石者乃孟公也。一六九九年，一七〇四年，一七二八年敎史謂孟公之踪跡猶見於上海；惟因雍正之難為聖敎，不得自由傳敎；卒被迫至廣州，於一七四三年卒於澳門。　　雍正後國籍敎士傳敎最為出名者：為何天章，嚴尚賢，樊守義，程儒良，羅秉中，高若望，陳聖修，沈東行諸司鐸。耶穌會士南懷仁L'Aimlekhoven（奧國籍）於一七五二年祝聖為南京主敎，在上海蘇州一帶宣傳福音中；在一七八五年計江蘇敎友有三〇·〇〇〇。除南主敎外，在上海四鄉傳敎者，又有國籍耶穌會士姚若翰。姚公卒於一七九六年。當此敎　時期，又有一不幸事件，即在一七七五年十一月十五日，在中國之耶穌會奉令解散，傳敎之前途頗呈慘澹焉　　耶穌會後在歐洲重行恢復，我國敎友聞此喜訊，即聯名上敎皇書請准耶穌會士來上海傳敎者。溯自耶穌會取消，江南敎務由北京味增爵會畢Mgr.Pirespereira主敎　理，一八三八年羅伯濟Mgr　de　Besi來江南，代畢主敎管理敎務；羅公為傳信部之司鐸，一八四〇年祝聖為主敎，繼畢公位，至是亦上書傳信部，與信友同求羅瑪，遺耶穌會士到上海傳敎。同年正月十三日傳信部總長　機法郎松義Card　Fronsoni　與耶穌會總長勞大恩Le　T.R.　P.　Roothaan商議是事，勞總長准之，將江南傳敎事務，委於法國巴黎省會士。省會長於一八四二年四月二十日派南格祿Gotteland艾方濟　Esteve李秀芳Brueyre三位會士乘輪來華，是年十月二十一日，三公安抵澳門，旋至上海。　　三公旣至上海，一八四三年羅主敎委李公創辦修院，院立於余山相近之張樸橋，南公為副牧，兼會長職，艾公　傳敎於浦東。　自以後，上海之敎務重　旗鼓，有蒸蒸日上之勢；耶穌會則建會於徐家匯，時道光二十七年（一八四七年）之事也。上海特區　公共汽車事業槪述  徐承勳　　上海公共汽車事業站於民國十三年（一九二四）經管者為英商中國公共汽車公司。但先該公司而興辦者，尚有中國汽車公司（Chinese　Motor　Bus　Co.　Ltd.）所創辦行駛靜安寺路至兆豐公園之一綫，當時祗有公共汽車兩輛行駛而已。此為上海公共租界行駛公共汽車之第一聲。　　中國公共汽車始創於民國十一年（一九二二），發起者為僑居上海之英人阿諾爾特（HE.　Arnhold）等：民國十二年（一九二三）阿諾爾特等集股一百萬元組織中國公共汽車公司在香港註册成立先行駛由外灘沿愛多亞路經福煦路及哈同路至靜安寺路一綫，該公司路綫及車輛因營業發達，後繼續擴充。　　目前因上海工商業日臻發達，因之路綫及車輛數目為適應現狀之故，較之以前已增加不少。路綫表車輛表　　（雙層始於民國二十三年四月一日）　　車廠位在公共租界康腦脫路一一七一號，佔地約四萬平方尺，足容公共汽車一百餘輛；其他如材料之堆藏，汽車之檢查，繕漆及裝置，均在此處。辦公處設在南京路一號，總事務所即在康腦脫路一一七一號。　　去年八一三　戰發生之後，本來通過蘇州河北之路綫即停止行駛，同時三路及七路即併為一綫行駛（行駛海格路Avanne　Haig，南至白利南路BrenanPiece之間）十五路即轉行至外灘為止，十四路亦於去年十月起始行駛，同年十二月　As二路及九路A合併為二一綫，（行駛安和寺路與四川路橋Am　fer　stamherst　and　Szecbnan　Rd.　Bridge法租界法商公共汽車於民國十六年（一九二七）二月一日開始行駛，其行駛範圍皆在法租界之內，因其行程頗長之故，現祗行駛兩路。（即二十一路及二十二路）辦公處及車廠均在法租界呂班路二四九號。　　二十一路（始於民國十六年）由外洋涇橋經愛多亞路，敏體尼蔭路，愷自邇路，蒲柏路，貝勒路，辣斐德路，金神父路至打浦橋為止。　　二十二路下行由外洋涇橋經愛多亞路，敏體尼蔭路，愷自邇路，愛多亞路，福煦路，聖母院路，蒲石路，亞爾培路，辣斐德路，拉都路福履理路，台拉斯脫路，海格路至徐家匯，上行由貝當路進福履理路按原路回至外洋涇橋。</p>

<p>春秋滬西女靑年會服務社　舉辦夏令衛生運動週  徐珍　　曾爲七百工人打防疫針　明日舉行兒童健康比賽　並舉辦衛生展覽母親會　　上海宗敎團體，常常超越常人的熱忱，在辦理種種敎育，慈善事業，他們在這些事業中間，往往能克服種種艱苦與困難，使他們所辦的事業如期實現。這一種精神，我常常想，可以說是宗敎者「殉道」的精神；他們雖然明知困難，但却能迎頭趕上去。雖然仔細研究他們的工作路綫，往往還是爲了「傳道」，但在客觀效果上，他們爲一般平民所造的福利，這在仟何團體中所僅見的。　　尤其是戰後的上海，滬西難民區及南市難民區的設立，各種救難團體之成立，國際敎友們不知化了多少心血　　比如以女靑年會說，她們這一羣，照樣的默默地幹着多少救難慈善的工作，她們不想什麽報酬，也不想得什麼人的獎勵，她們始終默默地依照着預定計劃，幹下了多少功績。　　最近，我知道她們在滬西工廠區域，又在辦理「夏令衛生運動週」，日期日由十九日起至二十五日止。工作是異常緊張的進行着，爲了明瞭詳細的內容，特地到靜安寺路女靑年會，訪問她們的勞工部主任張女士，她用了一口流利的北平話，淸朗的吿訴我這「夏令衛生運動週」舉行的意義及工作計劃。　　二百個女工學生　　滬西工廠區域，誰都知道那裏住滿了各個工廠的男女工人，他們生活的骯髒，淸苦，不是租界中心區少爺小姐們所可以想像得到的。他們沒有敎育，沒有醫藥，沒有娛樂，沒有休息，他們爲了生活，被人當作牛馬樣的看待。因此，第一步，女靑會特地在滬西小沙波路檳榔路口三和里二十三號設立了一個「滬西服務社」，這服務社啊作的對象，也就是滬西的男女工人。　　她們先爲女工們設立了一個女工學校，辦理到現在成績很不壊，每天上課時間雖然很短（早晚兩决），但女工來上學的，却有二百多人。　　最近這二百女工學生向服務社要求，因爲她們的家屬病了不能得到好好的診治，希望服務社能設立一個診病室，多請幾個醫生，能爲她們家屬看病。　　這個要求不但馬上被接受，而且也就立刻成立起來。　　醫藥診病不取費　　自從這個診病教成立以後，她們特地請了三位義務醫生，每逢星期二五下午四時至六時，及星期日十時至十一時開始應診。本來她們是決定不取什麼費用的，因爲你一個錢不收，反要引起一般工人們的懐疑，所以診費暫定收費五分，醫藥什麽當然是奉送的了。　　這三位熱心的義務醫生的名字，是沈徵華（她是尙賢堂的醫生一，倪逢生及郭星孫。　　自從夏令衛生運動週開始以後，這診病室爲工友們打的預防針，已經有三百多人，如使以派出去的護士到工人家中打過預防針合計起來，那麼總數有七百多人。　　她們的啊作當然不僅僅是打打預防針而已，一切時疫病症，她們都非常熱心的爲工友們診治，有許多病非得進醫院時，她們設法把病人介紹到難民醫院等慈善醫院去。　　現在每天應診的工友很多，她們很希望熱心的醫師們能盡一二個鐘頭的義務，爲滬西男女工人盡一點警師神聖的責任。如有願意去的醫師，可通知女靑年會勞工部張女士。　　捐贈獎品還不够　　除了診病室以外，夏令衛生運動週又舉辦「衛生展覽會」「兒童健康比賽」及「母親會」。　　「衛生展覽會」已於前日開幕，會塲中陳冽着商務，大衆，兒童，中華各書局的模型及各種衛生掛圖。　　二十五日舉行兒童健康比賽，這種比賽的意義，只是希望引起男女工人們對於衛生的注意罷了，比賽以後，並且頂備了一點棕欖公司及五洲藥房捐贈的棕橄香皂及五洲藥皂。　　據張女士表示，希望各界能損助一點蒼蠅拍及糖菓，她們可以分配贈給參加的孩子及母親。　　兒童健康比賽的額制是五十人，現在已有很多人報名。　　二十六日上午九時起，舉行母親會，下午舉行夏令術生運動週的結束會。　　各方捐贈醫藥費　　她們這個滬西服務社診病教成立之初，各方面捐的醫藥費用很多，最熱心是同孚路劉家捐一千元醫藥，新亞藥廠捐很多醫藥，聖瑪利亞同學會捐四百元，國際婦女團體代表國際友仁會捐診病床一架，他們的熱心都是很可敬佩的。「畫中愛寵」觀感  企華　　“Love　Affair”　雷電華出品　南京大戲院映　　「晝中愛寵」是一個除了戀愛之外，其他什麽也沒有的戀愛故事。那末，允許我在劇本之外，談一點「其他」。　　自然，最先得提起的是木片的導演，他幾乎是像寫作一章優美的詩篇那樣處理這化一般的戀愛故事的。第一是精緻和細膩：如到美國去結婚的却爾斯鮑育，到輪船上遇見了愛琳鄧。導演者從他們開始的一瞥起，一直到第一决接吻，把他們不知地墮入情網的過程，是利用了各種精細的陪襯來旁敲側擊，最後又用浪花沖激的畫面，及接吻時移下移上的鏡頭，寫出這一對戀人的熱奔放，是够生動可愛的。又　他們相約六個月之後，在紐約摩天樓頂相會，這塲戲他先寫受琳鄧從汽車中出來，再寫却爾斯鮑爾在樓上等候，第二决升降機上來的時候，隱隱地聽見救護車出動及開回的聲音，又開升降機的幾决問却爾斯鮑育下去嗎，及後來的雷雨交加，用這種精緻的寫法來加强却爾斯鮑育的焦慮迷茫，我以爲是很能感動人的。其他如却爾斯鮑育和愛琳鄧的下船，雙方的對方來接的時候，那些細小的動作，也都有趣。　　第二是情緒氣氛的把握：却爾斯鮑育偕愛琳鄧去見他祖母的那塲戲，那個憧憬着年輕時美夢的祖母一和這對墮人情網的新愛人，在祈禱和彈琴時，眞太感動人了；及至却爾斯鮑育重來，琴音的重覆，重覩遺物披肩，前後對比，沉痛悽凉的情緒，處處緊扣着觀衆的心弦。最後却爾斯鮑育諷刺愛琳鄧，及看到畫像後的大團圓，也够味。　　至於却爾斯鮑育和愛琳鄧的演技，南京大戲院的一位職員對我說「頗有譚味」，他的意思大概是指他們倆的演技，頗有譚派一抬手，一舉足那樣的韻味·寫些「觀後感」已屬廖化作先鋒了，對於平劇，更是「羊毛一，「火爆」的「海派」戲雖看過幾齣，什麼「京朝派」簡直就莫明其妙，自然更談不上「譚味」了，不過却爾斯鮑育和愛琳鄧在這戲中的「做工」頗爲重頭，那倒是實在的。如一開塲在輪船上的那樣冗長的戲，在他們演來，確是針鋒相對，而那些輕巧的動作，都很自然。兩次到祖母隱居的島上，第一次兩人同去，那種若即若離的姿態，和第二决却爾斯鮑育的傷感，也都是吃重的「做工」。允其最後那塲戲，愛琳鄧的强顏爲歡，和後來的高興得流下眼淚來，使人感動之至。　　我的「觀感」祇如此而已，如果眞想看「京朝派」的「高見」，在上海，似乎也有李萬春那樣的「名角兒」的。　　蕭屋泉先生作品（近在大新公司開個人畫展）雨過天靑  包天笑　　第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣　　但是多年不見的一對情侶，此刻相見了，好似黏住了一般。潘佩英幾次要走，都被趙樂天留住，說是：「好久不見，談談別後衷情。』一直到夕陽盤樹，暮靄蒼然，佩英要走時，他却留她吃了夜飯去，說：『我們這裏夜飯是很早的，不放心，我雇了汽車，送你到城裏去。潘佩英道時忍不住了，便問：『嫂子在家嗎？何妨請出來見見！』趙樂天正色的道：『嫂子我娶了兩位，倒幸虧他們，帮助我不少。』潘佩英聽了這話，不自覺的一個心直沉下去，好像直沉到脚底下。趙樂天那時父笑着說道：「你要見見兩位嫂子嗎？就在我身邊。』他把身邊的兩校拐杖，舉了起來，給她瞧道：『這便是你兩位嫂子，這一位在左，是左夫人，這一位在石，是右夫人。倒幸虧她們，朝夕相伴，出入相扶持，帮助了我不少。除了她兩位以外，沒有什麽嫂子。』佩英這時的心中，好像有人掇去了她幾十斤一塊大石頭，便說：『那來樂哥怎麽不娶一位嫂子呢？』趙樂天道：『我是一個僅有一條腿的人，是一個殘疾了，誰肯來嫁我一個殘廢的人呢？不比佩英妹，你是一個有幸福的人呀。』潘佩英道：『我的幸福在那裏？一提起我的身世，便早枕被人家瞧不起了。樂哥！你是知道我肿氣的。我若是無端被人恥笑一兩句話，我倒是髯可老死空山，不與世人相往來的了。』這天，她在趙樂天家裏，吃了那位老肘子所燒的菜，趙樂天送她回去。明天，趙樂天又來訪她。一個知道她志節昭然，決不爲了她是一個失節者的女兒而厭棄她。况且她的守貞不嫁，也許是爲着他咧。一個也不會因他是個一條腿的殘廢，而有所不滿，從前一封拒絕他的信，給他個很大的大的刺激，如今當然要報償他呀。以後的事，作者不必詞費，讀者諸君，可以想像得之。趙潘結婚的那天，他們還把袁淑文夫婦，請了來作爲介紹人咧。而趙樂天這一天竟裝了一天假腿，人家却瞧不出來，但他却嚷着『不慣！不慣！』不甘拋却左右二夫人呀。現在趙潘之間，已經生了一男一女兩個孩子，是一個幸輻的家駐了。正是　　但願有情成眷屬　翻從多難獲因緣（一四四）</p>

<p>游藝界香島影壇珍聞  銀絲　　胡蝶　減瘦著效　勤習英文　　銀后胡蝶女士，前為將演新華「楊貴妃」古裝影片，深感體胖增憂，曾亟厲行減瘦術經久甚勤。「楊貴妃」嗣因他故，暫緩開拍。決由當地南粤公司先將偵探劇「菲島血淚」提前拍演。南粤導演人為近甫被邀南去之王次龍君。此片南粤仍與新華合作，同時兼製國粤語兩種拷貝，彼此各得其一，固與前攝「胭脂淚」片辦法無殊也。關於減瘦術事，胡於數月來力行勿替，業已大著成效。日常除服藥，打針外，迄尚　絕米粒，惟將蔬菓麵包果腹如故。自上月間起，故又聘一專任敎師，攻習英文，蓋為當地各公司，近多兼製英語拷貝，為圖銷海外之謀，胡以未甘後人，因亦奮發為此，從而急起直追也。　　陳雲裳　專使速駕　來滬有期　　「花木蘭」陳雲裳女士，自揚名海上，「衣錦還鄉」之後，港地各電影公司一時爭邀攝片，莫不視為　寳。而陳以鄉誼情重，又多未便固却；以致困於大包圍下，勢將應付不遑，回滬無期。張善琨君主持之華成公司，於陳倚畀特殷，正有多片待拍。為此特派專使李大深君南下速駕，守待偕行。自經迭番交涉，已獲圓滿結果。南粤古裝片「西廂」紅娘一角，本與簽定合同，非拍不可。現經李君情商，解約作罷；但俟民族公司拍演中之「南島相思曲」工作完畢，便可偕同來滬。預計行期在廢磨五月底前，為時固已不遠矣。　　李綺年　藝華邀聘　商洽未定　　李綺年女士，負名南島影壇，向與陳雲裳並稱瑜亮。陳旣來滬攝片，一舉成名；李亦不禁怦然心動，頗欲踵起相競，展其長才。邇時藝華公司籌攝「王寳釧」片，女主角以張翠紅女士勿為乃夫所許，一再却謝，難得其選。因而屬意彼姝，隨由嚴幼祥君為赴港敦聘之行。惟李現隸香港南華公司，訂有長期專約。能否來滬，須視南華意向如何。而迭經商談之後，迄求獲有成議也。以意度之，殆將訂期後會，俟諸異日。蓋此王寳釧一角，張翠紅近為情不可却，已許勉為其難，即於日內動工開拍，藝華得此結果，因亦可無急需矣。　　彭飛　來滬求偶　邀請白虹　　王次龍君月前膺邀南粤公司去港攝片，係與大力士彭飛聯袂偕行。近除籌攝胡蝶主演之「菲島血淚」片外，又有摹倣西片「泰山情侶」之新劇本「中國泰山」，將由彭飛主演。王以片中女主角，須擇富於肉感美者，相與配演，而又確定白虹女士為一最適當之人選。由是專派彭飛到滬，晤白相邀。惟白現為新華基本演員，事實固須商得新華許可，「中國泰山」方能如願以償，欣然獲此「情侶」也。素心未白竟殉情  以鍾　　孤島的劇壇，目前是相當的熱鬧，許多名劇都繼續演出，現在，　俄的名劇「狄四娘」也行將上演了。　　「狄四娘」，這生疏的名字恐怕惹不起上海人士的注意，而且在上海也很難找到這珍貴的劇本，但我不禁記起從前金陵大學在南京公演時的盛况。那時是由名藝術家張道藩先生導演，劇情豪放凄絕，表演記得畫入微，當時曾惹得全塲觀眾落淚。不意睽隔多年，不久竟又將在這裏公演了。　　「狄四娘」是法國著名作家　俄的名作，（東亞病夫譯）是十八世紀浪漫主義的作品。描寫一個威尼斯巴鐸總督項日樂愛上一個女優狄四娘，而總督夫人白妲麗又與一平民羅道佛戀愛。當時正是宗敎與夫權極度盛行之時，總督因為發現羅道佛與白妲黑的情書，而不惜賜與無情的毒藥，强迫這毫無抵抗的羔羊在自己的眼前瞑目，在這淫威之下，狄四娘因為絕對愛羅道佛，同時也萬分同情這可憐的白妲麗。但狄四娘始終不得愛人羅道佛的諒解，羅道佛知白妲麗之死係出於狄四娘之所為，便以最無情的子彈，把整個靈魂愛着自己的狄四娘成為愛情的犧牲者。當白妲麗倉惶地出來時，羅道佛才恍然知道狄四娘因為愛着自己不惜以身殉情，來成全自己與白妲麗的愛情。這是一齣非常緊張的四角戀愛的五幕大悲劇　　現在已由聖靑劇團積極籌備，將於本月廿五日在環龍路法工部局禮堂公演。聽說這次收入的票資是移充諸聖堂靑年團契作慈善用的。聖靑劇團是由一班從前自南京來滬的戲劇工作者和戲劇愛好者所組織而成的一個嶄新的劇團，陣容是相當堅强的。預料演出成績一定不錯。對於「玩票」極感興趣的　寗萱將重登銀幕  銀笛　　在藝華新片「女子公寓」中演出　　息影已久的寗萱女士，現在又有重上銀幕的消息。過去，寗萱曾化名任慧萱，在天一公司的「熱血靑年」一片中露過臉，這可以說是寗萱的處女作。後來，為了她的父母反對她拍戲，　脫離天一。但她愛好電影的熱度並不因之而減退，終於取得了雙親的同意，以寗萱之名二次加入了天一。　　以天一之不能重用，不久她又轉入華安公司，自此寗萱　漸漸地在電影界裏抬頭，當華安的「麒麟樂府」第一集「斬經堂」大賣銅鈿之後，曾預備續攝第二集「明末遺恨」，內定由寗萱與周信芳合演，不意正在計劃時，戰事忽起，此事遂吿停頓之後，寗萱很熱忱地參加了傷兵醫院的看護工作，度過了一個電影界的消沉時期。　　近來，寗萱對於「玩票」極感興趣，參加了數次堂會和義務處，差不多已成為上海有名的女票友之一了。對於平劇寗萱是有了愛好，但她還沒有忘情於銀幕，不久以前曾在「影城記」一片中與徐琴芳合演「四郎探母」，現在藝華公司開拍「女子公寓」，她將在此片中，飾黃蕙芳一角；此後寗萱也就是藝華之一員了。上海之電台  大衛　　目前上海電台之多，實開未有之新紀元，但泰半係國軍西撤後，交通部國際電信局無形解放，乃紛紛設立者，計有二十餘家之多。往日無綫電中播特別節目，頗能引起百萬聽眾興趣，今則除慈善節目外，客家之播送特別節目者，往往四五天有一次，所播之節目無非滑稽申曲彈詞等，恐日久以後，聽眾將欲厭棄矣，蓋所謂特別節目當然要特別，今播來播去是老調，不能稱特別也明矣。　　電台之播送特別節目，往往播固定節目之客家受其損失，但亦有幾家電台情願照補日子於客家，但亦屬少數耳，故客家寗願出較貴之電費，不假座播特別節目之電台播送節目，實有因也。　　播送特別節目之電台泰半係入一三以後新設立者居多，其餘老電台除大陸電台則泰半係慈善特別節目為難民呼援，間或有一二以商業宣傳者亦有之，華東電台則除慈善節目外，拒不播送特別節目，故頗受固定客家及聽長節目之聽眾所歡迎，國華電台則特別節目較多，另有聽眾。　　初滬上之電台，除二四西人電台外，完全為華商經營，後國軍西撤，幾家著名華商電台不得不暫時轉讓於外商，即華東大陸東方三家亦不肯失節而讓渡與英商管理矣，上海富星二電台則均自動停業。其餘新設之電台，恕不贅述。至於廣吿方面，幾家老電台生意當然不成問題，以客家寗願出較貴之電費假座播送，以其擁有廣大之聽眾也；幾家新電台則價格較廉，客家亦不肯出較高之電費，往往以情面難却，而略出電費播送節目者，實屬不少，據我所知，電費最高者，首推華東，然大陸東方國華等老電台價亦不廉也。電台之成績，最佳者當推大陸華東國華等，外埠多能收得，本埠淸晰異常，尤其是華東能夠播至北平重慶，彈詞家嚴雪亭常在該台接到北平聽眾來信，點唱開篇，誠屬難能也。（義賣獻金）舞女聯誼社　昨日成立　　上海市舞業婦女聯誼社，係百樂門舞女王琴珍等發起，由袁履登陳鶴琴姚惠泉林康候陶樂勤等名流所贊助，昨日下午該社在寗波同鄉會召開成立大會，除推選名譽理事長袁履登名譽副理事長陳鶴琴理事王琴珍殷美鳳倪文仙韋楚雲楊文英候羅美等當選外，當時並由名譽理事長及西籍名譽理事等訓話，情况殊為熱烈云舞國寫影（廿八）  小田星六星紀之一陳曼麗　　說也慚愧，不曉得甚麽緣故，一天到晚，總是窮忙得很，但生性是重要然諾的，旣答應了本報每星期六撰一篇舞稿，倒也不肯失信，題目上「星六星紀」四字，就是表示每星期六寫一篇跳舞明星的記載，因為現在稱明星的，如電影明星，歌舞明星，交際明星之類，委實太多了，所以不得不註釋一下：　　舞塲跑了將近一年，這位天字第一號紅星，陳曼麗，却從沒請她伴過舞，這其間也有一點小小的理由，因為她坐檯的生意太忙了，偶爾遇着她坐在本位上的時候，這算是一個機會，但同舞一曲甫終，她又被別人喚去坐檯了，這時節你若等她下檯，不知等到什麽時候，若一走了帳，她雖並不介意，自己總覺的帶些揩油意味，要買舞票吧，一元二元似乎拿不出手，五元十元又好像太寃，所以還是不跳為是。我旣沒有請她伴過舞，對於她的舞技如何，當然不能有所藏否，不過她這人極聰明而且很有良心，這是從目見耳聞的兩椿事實上可以推想得到的，大約遠在五六年前，我一位親戚孫老太太，假座大中華飯店做壽唱堂戲，大軸是陳曼麗的全本棒打薄情郎，由孫履安先生飾金松，陳桐雲配莫稽，據桐雲說，曼麗的戲，就是由他指授的，我以為一個舞女演戲，那有什麽可看，不過孫履安先生的丑角，是向來馳名票界，而且不肯輕易演唱的，似乎不可錯過機會，不料曼麗的做表，居然超出意料之外，從來票友演戲，大多數的毛病，總是臉上無戲，曼麗居然會運用眼神，臉上非常生動，她是個票友，並且是初出台的票友，豈不是難能可貴，不是聰明人，能有這樣的成績嗎？　　至於良心好的推測，乃是另一位舞女吿訴我的，據說她曾與一位客人，結下朱陳之好，那客人也是一位靑衣票友，遭不幸在去年下世去了，這位陳小姐居然守到七七期滿，　肯出來重理舊業，你想旣無名分，更無所謂禮敎束縛，竟肯犧牲着花花綠綠鈔票，不要替人家守七，也可算是心喪了，這還不夠有良心嗎？梨園外紀  徐慕雲　　臥雲居士的墮落與李多奎的上進　　民國十七年硯秋蒞滬出演，多奎也隨同南下，那時他的包銀，才僅僅拿到三百塊錢，再除去陸五的八十塊錢，他只剩二百餘元啦。幸虧他的胞兄替他跟包，所以又能省下幾十元錢。有一天打鼓老喬三（玉泉）到我寓中向我說道：「聽說您向來很幫我們梨園行老角的忙，孫老元·瑞德寳·灌一回話匣子，都能收進七八百元，這次陸老先生，跟多奎南來一趟，繼拿到七八十元的包銀，可否請您也帮帮他的忙，同勝利公司的外國人說說，也灌他們幾張片子，隨便給他們幾個錢都可以的。」那時我因為行裏的工程師不在上海，頗覺躊躇。第二天喬三又來說：「現在已快到年底，陸先生接到北平家信，急等匯款到平還帳，可憐他出遠門一趟，自己才掙八十老洋，又那有餘錢寄回家中呢？」？我聽罷之後，也很代他憂慮，一面掬出十元錢，差人贍給陸五，一面竭力向大中華唱片公司接洽這事。那時我因兼任該公司的顧問，所以經一度商談之下，就將此事辦妥，說明三百塊錢灌三片，只費了數小時的工夫，李陸兩人已賺到一月包銀之數了。當然他們很覺開心，誰知兩星期後，樣片製出，成績非常美滿。一因多奎的嗓子衝，又係第一次灌音，想借此留個名譽。二因陸五先生頗知感念余之厚意，將所有老旦的好過門統統使了出來，所以結果才能如此之佳。翌年剛過正月十五，該公司復再三托余再灌李片若干，代價由每片百元，增為一百五十，因此遂又灌了五片。多奎雖僅南來一次，可是唱片製出後，銷到全國各埠，就是沒聽過他的戲的人，一聞得這條好嗓子，就起了一種好感，人說唱片能捧人，這話的確不錯。後來多奎的名氣一天高似一天，其得力於唱片的宣傳，却也不小呢。（四五）　　　今日棋苑暫停一天，明日照登。（編者）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Fighting in the Eastern Suburbs of Swatow; China Dispatches Large Reinforcements in Three Routes; Street Fighting in the City Has Not Stopped; Japanese Planes Continue Bombing; Japanese Troops Attacking the Port Are Repelled; Meixi Has Been Recaptured <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xingning Telegraph, after the Chinese army retreated from Swatow, they are now defending the line from Anbu to Jinsha City, forming an encirclement of Swatow together with Chaoyang to the west. The Japanese have transported over a thousand cavalrymen and many armored vehicles, attempting to cut off the main eastern route of the Chinese army. Yesterday, there was fierce fighting in Anbu, with heavy casualties on the Japanese side. The Chinese side has dispatched large reinforcements in three routes. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chao'an: The Chinese army's assault troops recaptured Anbu and Meixi on the evening of the 23rd. Currently, both sides are in a stalemate in Caitang, west of Anbu. (23rd Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the fighting in the eastern suburbs of Swatow, around the airfield, is still extremely fierce, with heavy Japanese casualties. Unless further reinforcements are sent, it will be difficult for the Japanese to advance. Not only in the suburbs of Swatow, but the fighting remains in a stalemate. At the same time, street fighting is also taking place in Swatow city. The Chinese army is using sturdy steel-reinforced concrete buildings as fortresses, placing machine guns in key locations to resist. Therefore, Japanese planes are still heavily bombing Swatow. Also, it is reported that Japanese troops sailing up the Han River in motorboats to Anbu attempted to land there and advance westward, but after a night of fierce fighting, the Japanese finally retreated. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, this office received news from Chinese sources that Chinese and Japanese troops are currently fighting in the eastern suburbs of Swatow and near the airfield. The telephone line between Swatow and Chaozhou was still open at 10:00 PM on June 21st. Furthermore, according to a Chinese telegram issued at 6:00 AM yesterday, the Chinese army in Swatow is still defending the city's inner and outer positions. It was then learned that they are engaged in street fighting with the Japanese. Yesterday, over forty Japanese planes took turns bombing Swatow twelve times until 9:00 PM last night, still circling over Swatow and dropping bombs. At the same time, another group of Japanese troops advanced along the Han River (transliterated) in motorboats, reaching Anbu, twelve miles north of Swatow. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Chao'an: After withdrawing from Anbu on the morning of the 23rd, the Chinese army in Swatow deployed defenses in the northwestern suburbs. At around 10:00 AM, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack, and gunfire erupted again. The Japanese, not daring to linger, retreated to the streets, and the fighting subsided. There was peace and quiet north of Anbu. (23rd Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports, the Japanese army forcibly landed near Swatow on the morning of the previous day, under the cover of airplanes and warships, and advanced towards the city in an encirclement. The Chinese garrison bravely resisted, and the fierce fighting is still ongoing. To understand the battle situation and the Japanese intentions, reporters visited the military authorities and inquired about everything. According to the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, the Japanese army's invasion of Swatow was expected, and the Chinese army had already made preparations and deployed defenses in the area, giving the landed Japanese army an unexpected blow. They are now concentrating their forces and fighting fiercely with them near Swatow, striving to achieve the predetermined goal of depleting the Japanese army. As for the Japanese army's occupation of Swatow, it has no value in terms of military significance. Its main intention is not military but economic, allowing them to seize the interests of various countries along the Pacific coast and eliminate the influence of Europe and the United States in China, thereby fulfilling their ambition to dominate East Asia. In short, the fact that the Japanese army recently does not dare to penetrate deep into the interior but only harasses the coastal ports is enough to prove that it is a kind of struggle in a deep predicament. The Chinese army is determined to give the Japanese army a heavy blow according to the predetermined plan and promote its early collapse. (23rd Telegraph)</p>
<p>Chao'an: The Japanese army invading Swatow advanced in four routes on the 22nd. (1) Advancing from Donghu to Dahao, they encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. Subsequently, the Japanese army sent hundreds of reinforcements and bombarded with concentrated artillery fire. Due to terrain constraints, the Chinese army shifted to the west bank of Dahao in the evening and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese. (2) Over six hundred Japanese troops advanced from Sijiwei and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Xincun and Yangcun areas (four or five li northwest of Sijiwei). (3) In the Qilu airfield area in the eastern district of Swatow, although the Japanese army launched a combined attack by land, sea, and air, the Chinese army still held its positions, and the Japanese army could not advance an inch. Swatow was still in the hands of the Chinese army until 8:00 PM. (4) The Japanese infantry and cavalry, which had repeatedly detoured to attack Anbu, were met with a head-on blow from the Chinese army and retreated. They then launched an attack along the river with over twenty small motorboats carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers at around 11:00 PM on the 22nd, and were intercepted by the Chinese army in Meixi (east of Anbu), where a mixed battle broke out.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from Swatow today, Swatow is now peaceful, and some Chinese people have returned to the city. Foreigners are also safe. Furthermore, according to refugees who arrived here from Swatow today, an air raid alarm occurred in Swatow at 4:30 AM on the 21st, when seventeen Japanese planes heavily bombed the defensive areas around Swatow until 6:00 AM. At the lighthouse on Bread Island (transliterated), the Japanese flag was raised. By 9:00 AM, seven Japanese warships appeared in the harbor, increasing to ten by 10:00 AM, all anchored opposite the Mobil Oil depot and fiercely bombarding Swatow. Many shrapnel shells fell at the Mobil Oil depot, and a Syrian employee was injured by the shrapnel. By 10:45 AM, two fires had started in the city, obviously the result of Japanese naval bombardment. At 6:00 PM, the Chinese side blew up the waterworks. It is said that at that time, the Japanese army had advanced to the suburbs of Swatow, and subsequently, small teams of Japanese troops invaded. The entire city fell the next morning. At this time, the American warship "USS Pillsbury" was berthed at Mobil Oil's No. 2 buoy. No marines from other countries landed. On Thursday afternoon, the American warship "USS Pope" arrived in Swatow, and the captain visited the senior Japanese officer. After that, Swatow became very peaceful.

<p>(Swatow) The Japanese army occupied Swatow at dawn today, amidst a city-wide fire caused by the Chinese scorched-earth policy. Last night, the city was ablaze, illuminating miles around, and many warehouses and buildings were razed to the ground. The Chinese army further destroyed the waterworks before retreating. So far, there have been no reports of harm to the lives and property of foreigners. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Because after the fall of Swatow, almost all of China's important eastern seaports, except for Ningbo, have fallen into Japanese hands, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to prevent the Japanese from using these ports to promote the sale of Japanese goods, has collected all the trademarks of Japanese goods, compiled them into a book, and approved its distribution to anti-Japanese goods organizations across the country for detailed identification so that they can effectively boycott Japanese goods. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>If the Japanese Army Attempts to Invade the Interior, It Will Suffer a Major Setback</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily News editorial today stated that the Japanese army, having failed on various fronts, decided to land in Swatow to divert international and domestic attention. It should be known that the Japanese army's landing in Swatow is not an action to expand their offensive in China, but rather exposes Japan's weakness. The Japanese army's offensives in northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and southern Shanxi have already failed, and the end of the war is nowhere in sight. Therefore, they decided to take this action. The Chinese military authorities in the Swatow-Chaozhou area have made the necessary military preparations. With the help of Japanese warships and airplanes, they may be able to land along the coast, but to achieve their goals, they will inevitably make major sacrifices. If the Japanese army attempts to invade the interior, their adventurous actions will be severely punished. The mountains west of Swatow are continuous, and the Cantonese are also known as excellent soldiers. In recent months, the villagers in the Swatow-Chaozhou area have been organized, trained, and armed to prevent any unforeseen events. These strong self-defense groups will provide the most resolute resistance to the Japanese invasion. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun told reporters yesterday that the Japanese army's occupation of Swatow will not affect the future of the Sino-Japanese war. Gu stated that the number of Chinese military supplies imported into the interior through Swatow was very small. The Japanese army's occupation of Swatow is still far from achieving a "European-style" victory. He said that the news of the Japanese army's victory is heavily publicized in the newspapers, but because of the proper use of guerrilla tactics by the Chinese army, the prolongation of the war and the depletion of the Japanese army's capabilities are not hindered. He said, "The Japanese army's actions against Swatow are undoubtedly a prelude to the Japanese army's actions against Hong Kong. The Japanese army feels that the time has come for actions against Hong Kong and can launch them at any time." (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>British Naval Authorities Order Resumption of Hong Kong-Swatow Shipping</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British naval authorities here have advised British shipping companies to resume the Swatow route. Although the Japanese have requested that foreign ships not enter the port of Swatow, the British authorities do not recognize this blockade. The British gunboat HMS Gannet and the destroyer HMS Scout are currently stationed in the port of Swatow to protect British ships from interference by others. The American warship USS Pillsbury and the USS Pope are also currently in Swatow. The destroyer HMS Ashville has already sailed to Gulangyu today but is prepared to sail to Swatow if necessary. When the British ship SS Falaminia arrived in Hong Kong this morning, Reuters reporters boarded the ship and saw that only two British women, one American woman, and three children had been evacuated from Swatow. However, the ship carried 300 Chinese refugees, some of whom were British citizens. (23rd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to official sources here today, the blockade implemented by the Japanese army in Swatow is not recognized by the British side. Therefore, the British naval authorities have asked British ships to continue sailing to Swatow for trade. This indicates that the British side is determined to break the Japanese blockade. Because the British navy has already issued this advice, Jardine Matheson's "Foshan" and Swire's "Jiangsu" are scheduled to sail to Swatow on Sunday. At the same time, no American expatriates have yet evacuated. Although the British naval authorities are currently maintaining silence, many officers believe that the British and American response to the Japanese blockade of Swatow is clearly very strong. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Today, all newspapers here published the news that Britain refused to recognize the Japanese blockade of Swatow as legitimate with large headlines. It is reported that the British authorities notified all British ships to maintain shipping routes to Swatow as usual. Today, the British ship "Foshan" is the first ship to sail to Swatow in accordance with this notification. The second British ship is scheduled to sail to Swatow on Sunday. (23rd Haitong Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The first batch of foreign women and children evacuated from Swatow arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of the 23rd. The British naval authorities ordered British ships to continue sailing between Hong Kong and Swatow, and refused to recognize the Japanese blockade of Swatow. (23rd Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons that the British authorities, with the cooperation of the Japanese side, are prepared to evacuate all British women and children stationed in Swatow. Chamberlain warned that Britain intends to take any necessary measures to deal with Japan's request that all foreign warships withdraw from Swatow. The British government is "extremely concerned" about Japan's demands. When asked about "the Japanese invasion of foreign interests in China is our attempt to dominate the Far East," he replied, "I hope it will not be so." Previously, Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Halifax and the leaders of the French land, sea, and air forces to consider the new actions of the Japanese army in China. A British government spokesperson declared that if Japan continues its anti-British policy, "Britain will naturally take countermeasures. Britain's position cannot remain unclear for long." At this time, the British government is in constant contact with the United States regarding the events in China. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation in the port of Swatow, China, naval circles here recently declared that the Japanese naval authorities in China had "requested" that ships of all countries leave the port, but did not issue an ultimatum. This will definitely be rejected by Britain. In addition, the interests of Britain and the United States in the port of Swatow are the same, and Britain's attitude is even more firm. In short, since British ships are in the port, they will definitely stay there. (22nd Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>The United States Sends More Warships to Swatow to Protect Expatriates</p>
<p>(Washington) The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, telegraphed Washington last night that he had refused Japan's request that U.S. warships withdraw from Swatow. Yarnell telegraphed Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, that he had notified Japan that the United States would protect American citizens wherever necessary. Yarnell's note to the Japanese Navy declared, "He will strive to fulfill his mission in a way that avoids interfering with Japanese military operations." The note was submitted by U.S. Consul General Gauss in Shanghai. U.S. naval circles here solemnly stated that Admiral Yarnell's declaration was a reiteration of his declaration in 1937, when he declared that U.S. warships had the right to protect American interests in China wherever and whenever necessary and intended to continue to do so. U.S. Consul in Swatow, Mr. Young, reported to the State Department that the 48 American expatriates in Swatow were all safe. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Since the Japanese ultimatum was issued yesterday, in addition to the British warship HMS "Tern" and the American warship USS "Pillsbury" already in Swatow, two more foreign warships have sailed into the port of Swatow, namely the American warship USS "Pope" and the British warship HMS "Scout." It is reported that after the Japanese army occupied Swatow, they appointed Chen Juemin as the chairman of the maintenance committee. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for Weir &amp; Hanbury Steamship Company, the Japanese tried to land at the company's wharf yesterday, mistaking it for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf. The company informed them that this was not the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's wharf but the property of Weir &amp; Hanbury, and if the Japanese army wanted to land here, it would be regarded as a violation of foreign interests, and a protest would be lodged. At that point, the Japanese gave up. (23rd Associated Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Japanese naval authorities' request that American warships withdraw from the port of Swatow, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell has refused. The full text of the reply, which was forwarded to the Japanese side by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, has recently been published here, stating that "The Japanese authorities have announced that their navy will begin operations against the port of Swatow, China, and have notified foreign nationals and warships to leave the port. Regarding this matter, please inform the Japanese Consul in Shanghai to convey to the senior authorities of their navy that the duty of the United States warships in the Far East is primarily to protect American nationals. Wherever there is a need, American warships will sail to that place. In short, as long as American expatriates in China need protection and assistance, American warships will remain in Chinese ports." George's Democratic Congressman Vincent (Chairman of the House Naval Committee) recently commented, "I fully agree with Admiral Yarnell's reply. As long as American citizens reside in a place, the government is responsible for their protection." Otawa's Republican Congressman Volis declared, "I believe that if we can hold out to the end, Japan will eventually back down." (22nd Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department recently confirmed that the Japanese naval authorities requested that American warships leave the port of Swatow, which was rejected by Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. It also learned that the American destroyer USS "Pillsbury" not only did not intend to leave the port of Swatow, as requested by the Japanese, but another destroyer, USS "Pope," had just sailed into the port of Swatow. (21st Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry's Attitude Gradually Softens</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that Japan's warning to all countries to evacuate Swatow was a "friendly suggestion," not an ultimatum as claimed by foreign newspapers. The Japanese naval authorities believed that under the current circumstances, it was necessary for foreign warships to leave Swatow to avoid unfortunate incidents. In fact, advising foreign warships to leave Swatow does not mean that foreign ships are not allowed to dock at Swatow. (23rd Haitong Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) According to Japanese officials here, the Japanese Navy will no longer demand that foreign warships leave Swatow. According to a Japanese spokesperson to an Associated Press reporter, this decision by the Japanese side "request" has been "misunderstood." The Japanese said that the purpose of asking foreign warships to leave Swatow was to avoid accidents due to excessive crowding in the port. When asked if the Japanese side had softened its stance due to the rejection of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese spokesman considered it inaccurate.

<h3 id="e2">An Analytical View of the Swatow Landing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper has yet to comment on the Japanese army's landing in Swatow, China. Although Swatow is a Chinese seaport, it is far from the main battlefields, and transportation is difficult. Foreign ships are also subject to inspection by Japanese warships. Therefore, it has never been used as a route for importing military supplies, and its gains and losses are irrelevant to military transport. The decisive battle between China and Japan will certainly not take place along the coast. Economically speaking, although those who depend on Swatow for their livelihood are not few, China's vitality is based on the interior. The restriction of foreign exchange and foreign goods is intended to preserve national strength, and we are working tirelessly to do so. Therefore, the fall of the seaport will help to strengthen the restriction and promote domestic production. From the perspective of the overall war of resistance, Swatow is insignificant. However, the international arena is quite disturbed by Swatow. In general, public opinion in Britain, France, and the United States sees this as a new stimulus. Germany and Italy are advocating for Japan, extravagantly presenting it as a great harvest. The Japanese army is also "listening to the news" and claiming how valuable it is militarily, economically, and politically. Of course, the gains and losses of a city or a pool of water cannot be dismissed as nothing. But to say that the gains and losses of Swatow will have much impact is an exaggeration. Japan, taking advantage of its strengths in the sea and air, took this coastal pocket-sized area, which is said to be as easy as taking something out of a bag. But they waited nearly two years after the start of the war to do so, which is enough to prove that it had little significance in the first place. However, on the Japanese side, they have some success to boast about. And since it has only been three days, they have fully achieved what they sought, "seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence." What they seek is not this city or this pool of water, for it is a scorched earth, and what good is it to obtain it? Nor is it in military, economic, or political terms, for to say this has any value or meaning is deceptive. What they seek is propaganda material, and now they have obtained it, and they are also publicizing it as much as possible, internally to comfort their soldiers and civilians, and externally to dazzle Britain, France, the United States, Germany, and Italy. This is their success, and it cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Why do they seek propaganda material to comfort their soldiers and civilians? Why do they seek current propaganda material and increase their current dispersion of military strength, and the worry that isolated troops will be difficult to protect in the future? This is not what we want to explain in detail. In short, in the past month, they have lost soldiers in western Shanxi and generals in northern Hubei, and propaganda material is indeed difficult to obtain. Therefore, seeking it in Swatow has its own difficulties. Moreover, it can also be used to dazzle other countries, which is a double win. But why dazzle other countries? This has two meanings. Japan and the German-Italian Axis share the same bed but have different dreams, and their alliance is only superficial. What Germany and Italy want most from Japan is that when war breaks out in Europe, Japan will use all its naval, land, and air forces to stand on the same front as Germany and Italy. Otherwise, Germany and Italy have no use for Japan. What Japan fears most is the United States at sea, and it cannot help Japan resist the United States, so it can only curry favor with the United States. On land, it is the Soviet Union, and it is willing to ally with Germany and Italy to defend against the Soviet Union. Other than that, it does not want to be bound to Germany and Italy because of the future changes in Europe, and only be a tool for Germany and Italy. The theory of a tripartite military alliance, although it has been promoted in many ways, has not been agreed upon in the end, because Japan and Germany and Italy have different wishes. However, as the international situation gradually becomes unfavorable to Japan, it seeks to collude with Germany and Italy in order to avoid being dragged into the European vortex, and does not want to conclude a broad military alliance with Germany and Italy. At the same time, it urgently needs Germany and Italy to support it in order to deal specifically with the Far East and the Soviet Union, and to form some kind of agreement. Therefore, due to the contradiction of conditions, it is necessary to dazzle Germany and Italy with certain things so that Germany and Italy can recognize what Japan is doing in the Far East, which is indirectly beneficial to Germany and Italy's activities in Europe, in order to promote Germany and Italy to accept Japan's proposal for a tripartite alliance. Their blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin and their landing in Swatow have this meaning. This is one. The international maneuvering and bargaining are unpredictable. Therefore, while each country is doing its best to enhance its own strength as the basis for victory, it is also creating all kinds of threatening false noises in the hope of winning outside of strength. Although rational people judge that false noises are ineffective, so far, no one dares to assert that cowards will certainly not succumb to false noises. For this reason, although Britain, France, and the United States have shown a strong response after the Japanese army landed in Swatow, at the beginning of the Japanese landing, they fully expected Britain, France, and the United States to be overwhelmed by the threat and gradually soften their stance. The inverted acts in northern Tianjin and southern Swatow have intensified, dazzling Britain, France, and the United States with the determination to attack. This is the second.</p>
<p>In this situation, we firmly believe that Britain, France, and the United States will not change their policies under threat, so we can assert that Japan's false noise and threats are futile. However, we also believe that Japan will not abandon its aggression because of other countries' expressions of disgust, so we can assert that the empty protests of Britain, France, and the United States are ineffective! As for the judgment of fate, it depends only on the action of strength. There is no doubt that Japan's strength is insufficient to win. But as long as they arrange things step by step without rushing to catch up and make an effective response, there is a possibility that there will be some kind of unexpected change, which may cause other countries to be caught off guard and suffer its poison. For example, using Hainan Island to target Vietnam, using Swatow to spy on Hong Kong, all of today's seemingly false noise and threats can be used unexpectedly in the event of a one-in-ten-thousand chance. This is what should be paid attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Concerning the Situation in the Tianjin Concessions, the Puppet Authorities Make Four Demands, Presented to the British and French Embassies, Including Political and Monetary Issues, a Large Anti-British, Anti-Communist Meeting is Held in Peiping, Participants Show No Interest <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) It was learned here today that the "Provisional Government" of Peiping has presented the British and French embassies with the following four demands regarding the situation in the foreign concessions of Tianjin: Terrorists and communists in the concessions should be extradited immediately; cooperation must extend to the "Provisional Government's" monetary policy, including banning the circulation of banknotes of the National Government and assisting in the transfer of the National Government's reserves within the British concession; inspecting Chinese banks, money shops, and stores in the British concession; and suppressing all actions and expressions of opinion that violate the "Provisional Government's" policies. It is reported that the British consular authorities received a letter from the "Mayor" of Tianjin on June 22, enclosing a draft of the "Provisional Government's" letter to the British and French embassies presenting the above demands. It is also reported that the French consular authorities received the same letter, warning that if the concession authorities tolerate any disturbances caused by the Chiang Kai-shek regime, the "Provisional Government" will have to investigate the root of the problem and take necessary steps. The British warship HMS Lowestoft (990 tons) arrived in Beidaihe today and is said to be heading to Shanhaiguan, and the HMS Dainty will also visit Qinhuangdao. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The anti-British, anti-communist meeting held here today was clearly a failure. Although there were as many as 3,000 Chinese participants, the Japanese propagandists, despite their earnest speeches, were met with indifference from the audience, who showed no interest. Many did not even sing along to the anti-British songs prepared by the organizers. Most of the participants were schoolchildren who did not understand the fiery anti-British and anti-communist speeches, so they simply played around. As for the older attendees, most were indifferent good-natured people with no anti-British or anti-communist sentiments. Therefore, although the Japanese propagandists passionately advocated a hard line against Britain and communism, there was no enthusiastic response from the audience below, and very few joined in the singing. However, many anti-British slogans were indeed posted on the walls of the Forbidden City, stating that the current Sino-Japanese war was entirely instigated by the British and advocating the recovery of the concessions. At the same time, propaganda teams were singing anti-British songs in various parts of the city. It is also reported that similar anti-British gatherings are being held in the surrounding rural areas. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to Japanese official sources here last night, the Tianjin issue has now escalated. In addition to demanding that the British extradite the four Chinese to the Japanese side, the Japanese government will also demand that the British authorities transfer the Chinese funds held in the British concession to the "Joint Reserve" bank. Unless the latter demand is also accepted by the British side, the Japanese side will not lift the blockade. The Japanese side also accused the British side of preventing them from circulating the new currency system in North China. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin reports that there is still no communication between the British authorities in Tianjin and the Japanese side. Observers believe that although the Japanese military unanimously advocates a hard line against Britain, there seems to be no room for negotiation. However, Japanese merchants in Tianjin all hope for an early resolution. It is reported that before implementing the blockade, the Japanese military notified all merchants to completely move their goods out of the concessions, but very few actually complied. Because Japanese merchants' goods are all under control in the country, they hoard a large amount of goods in Tianjin, but there are few warehouses in the city, so the inventory is concentrated in the British and French concessions. Currently, the warehouses of the International Transportation Company, Hebei Provincial Bank, and others are piled high with goods. Merchants are extremely dissatisfied with the military blockade due to the suspension of trade. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Far Eastern Situation Under Review, If Japan Persists in Aggressive Attitude, the US Will Take Stern Measures, If It Does Not Completely Withdraw from the Far East, It Must Resist Firmly, Japan Should Understand That the US Will Not Overlook the Tianjin Affair, Newspapers All Say That US Cooperation is Necessary to Curb Japan's Ambitions <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Far Eastern situation is currently under intense study by the relevant authorities here, and newspapers are discussing effective actions to deal with Japan. Although the press refuses to consider resorting to war, various forms of economic pressure, such as boycotting Japanese goods, ceasing trade with Japan, or even implementing a blockade, seem to be generally supported. In general, American public opinion may have various prejudices regarding European events and is unwilling to actively cooperate with democratic countries, but in the Far East, concerns are much reduced. A senior official close to the White House recently made informal remarks, stating, "It is true that the protests made by the United States to Japan have been worded mildly, and efforts have also been made to promote a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident, but if Japan persists in its aggressive attitude, the United States is very likely to take stern measures to make it respect American rights in China. Government officials acknowledge that the significance of the incidents in Tianjin and Shantou is far more serious than the temporary damage to American interests. Japanese spokesmen have threatened to no longer respect the Open Door Policy, but this policy, like the Monroe Doctrine, is a cornerstone of American foreign policy and cannot be allowed to be violated. In short, after the constant occurrence of incidents in China, the United States will have to choose one of the following two paths: to put it bluntly, it must either completely withdraw from the Far East or resist firmly. Specifically regarding the Tianjin incident, it is still unknown whether the United States should make a decision immediately or delay determining its policy. At this time, the U.S. government is proceeding cautiously, unwilling to be more active than Britain and France, so as not to force Japan to take immediate action, but at the same time, it is working to make its position clear, so that Japan understands that the United States will not overlook the Far Eastern problem. Observers in political circles say that the Japanese actions against the British and French concessions in Tianjin are due to the belief that Britain and France cannot send warships from Europe to the Far East. Newspapers therefore all state that if Japan's attempt to control Asia is to be curbed, it cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the United States. In addition, the State Department compares the methods currently adopted by Japan with those of Germany, saying that both countries' strategies are based on alienating the other side and are well aware that democratic countries are averse to war and are unwilling to use force to defend various interests that are not very important on the surface, and therefore make every effort to exploit this psychology, repeatedly increasing their demands. All of this is the same." (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Meets Japanese Ambassador</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this morning, Conservative MP Pilkington asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether he intended to immediately implement retaliatory measures against Japan regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British concession in Tianjin, China. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "I do not believe that the situation has yet reached this stage." Thereupon, Prime Minister Chamberlain also presented a report, saying, "Members of Parliament have probably already read the news that British nationals in Tianjin have been subjected to insults in recent days. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax has invited Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu to meet with him today to discuss this matter. At this time, there is a severe shortage of fresh food in the British and French concessions. The amount transported into the concessions each day is only 10% of the normal amount. The government is discussing remedies. As for flour and rice, the stocks in the two concessions are still quite sufficient." Thereupon, Conservative MP Adams asked, "Regarding the insults suffered by British nationals in Tianjin, does the Prime Minister intend to notify the Japanese government that this action may cause British nationals around the world to suffer serious consequences?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "These insults are intolerable. Foreign Secretary Halifax will certainly inform Ambassador Shigemitsu today of our views on this matter." Thereupon, opposition Labour MP Henderson asked the Prime Minister to report on the situation in Shantou, China. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the government had not yet received official news. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) When Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had requested Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu to meet with him at the Foreign Office today because of the recent atrocities against British nationals in Tianjin, the whole house cheered. The Prime Minister continued, "Members of Parliament have probably already read the news that British nationals in Tianjin continue to be subjected to insults." Labour MP Adams asked, "Does the Prime Minister intend to communicate to Tokyo that the insults suffered by the British may have serious consequences for Japanese nationals in British territories around the world?" The Prime Minister replied, "The Foreign Secretary will undoubtedly explain to Shigemitsu our view of this intolerable insult." Labour leader Henderson then asked about the situation in Shantou after the Japanese military issued the final ultimatum. The Prime Minister replied that he had not yet received an official report on this matter today, but according to news reports, the Japanese side seemed to have made some concessions regarding its position. Conservative MP Pilkington also asked the Prime Minister whether he would consider immediately implementing retaliatory measures. The Prime Minister replied that he did not believe the situation had reached that stage. The Prime Minister also replied to a question from Labour MP Wilkins that he could not comment on the total number of British nationals currently in Tianjin before he received notification. Mr. Haleji also asked whether the Prime Minister knew that the British people's anger had been aroused and that they were willing to back him when the Prime Minister mentioned this intolerable insult. The Prime Minister did not answer. Mr. Hai continued to ask whether the Prime Minister had any statement regarding the panic of British nationals in Tianjin. The Prime Minister replied that the current supply in the Tianjin concession was only one-tenth of normal and that measures were being studied to make up for the lack of various non-perishable foods in the concession. The stock of rice and flour currently stored in the concession is still quite sufficient. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the unfortunate events in Tianjin have gradually become intolerable. Chamberlain also said that Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu today and clearly informed Shigemitsu of the British government's view, that is, that this kind of insult has reached an intolerable point. When asked about the possibility of retaliation against Japan, Mr. Zhang claimed, "I don't think we have reached the point where we have to consider this." When answering a question from Conservative Adam, he said, "The British government is determined to ensure that the residents of Tianjin can obtain sufficient food." He also said that regarding the Japanese side's letter to Lamenton ordering foreign warships to withdraw from Shantou, the Japanese side seemed to have made a considerable retreat. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, when the House of Commons meets on the 26th of this month, several Conservative MPs will demand that the government take strong measures to deal with Japan. Among them, Sir Milner will advocate that the government should negotiate with Japan regarding the insults suffered by British nationals, demanding an apology and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

<p>(Singapore) Multiple sources believe that the British and French defense conference being held here takes a serious view of the situation in Tianjin and Shantou. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, may return to China early, but this has not been confirmed. It is also believed that the protection of Hong Kong is an important feature of the discussion. It is reported that defense experts believe that Hong Kong can withstand a long siege because it has recently taken measures to expand and modernize Hong Kong's defenses. Defense experts also believe that although the British and French navies are smaller than the navy of the enemy in the Far East, they still have great nuisance value, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements. Thorough preparations have been made for stationing a battle fleet in Singapore in wartime. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Singapore) According to news here today, the British and French joint defense conference being held here has made important decisions on various key points today. The naval, air, and land subcommittees of the conference all met separately. The naval committee discussed how the British and French navies should jointly patrol in the China Sea in the event of an incident, and decided on a thorough plan for warships to protect merchant ships. The air force committee discussed the plan to reinforce the Singapore air force from India based on the results of recent British and French naval exercises. The land subcommittee deliberated on how Britain and France would mobilize their military resources in the Far East. According to the Singapore Times, the conference has made concrete decisions on actions to be taken in the event of war. It is also reported that the Siamese Air Force will visit Singapore on July 4. According to the Singapore Times, the conference fully discussed the importance of Siam's position, and the Siamese Air Force's visit here therefore has important political significance. It is reported that the Siamese Air Force's visit to Singapore is the first of its kind. The Siamese aircraft participating in the visit include ten aircraft, nine Corsair reconnaissance bombers and one Martin bomber. After arriving here, they will stay here for two or three days to observe the performance and training of the British Air Force bombing, and will be hosted by the Governor of Singapore, Stenton, and the British Far East Air Force Commander, Babbington.

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Soldiers Intensify Searches in Tianjin, British Nationals Suffer Insults, Clothes and Shoes Removed for Thorough Inspection, Even Respected Individuals Not Spared <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Seven British nationals were ordered by Japanese searchers yesterday to strip naked for inspection, and were subjected to other insults. Crowds of Chinese men and women watched, finding it strange. British nationals are extremely indignant about this kind of atrocity. Yesterday, Japanese searchers invaded a certain location within the British concession and boarded a British barge moored at the Jardine Matheson wharf to investigate its cargo. By the time the British authorities received the news and sent personnel to the scene to stop them, the group had already fled. The Japanese Consul-General has sent the same letter to the foreign consulates, stating that all foreigners entering and leaving the blockade zone must carry their nationality certificates, must not be arrogant, and must strive to be humble, and must not photograph objects without the permission of Japanese personnel. The British Consul-General has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General regarding the Japanese personnel's strip searches and boarding of British cargo ships for inspection, and has mentioned that British national Smith has been detained by the Japanese side for a week, and has asked why he has not been released. The Japanese Consul-General has promised to reply today. The Soviet authorities have also protested to the Japanese Consul-General because the Japanese side has insulted Soviet citizens. According to eyewitnesses, there are a total of 200 Soviet nationals in Tianjin, and they have been subjected to shameful insults. Even Soviet women have been subjected to strip searches, which were conducted by women, but the final interrogation was still conducted by a man. Yokohama Specie Bank has announced that it is willing to resume transactions with import and export merchants on the basis of 14 pence, but the bank is not responsible for losses incurred by merchants due to the current situation. Yesterday, three British nationals tried to enter the Special District, formerly the German concession, through the barriers on Wilson Street. One was Mr. Davis, a junk dealer and honorary agent for Newsron, one was Mr. Haoth, an employee of the Pacific Trading Company, and one was Mr. Lauder, an assistant secretary of the Tianjin Race Club. Mr. Davis was allowed to pass through without special harassment. However, when Mr. Haoth and Mr. Lauder arrived in front of the search post, the Japanese personnel immediately asked, "Are you British?" The two men replied in the affirmative, whereupon the Japanese personnel waved them to a mat in the middle of the walkway and ordered them to strip for searching. The two men then stripped naked in front of Chinese women and children, who were also waiting to be searched. Mr. Haoth stripped completely naked, while Mr. Lauder was allowed to keep his shirt and trousers on. The clothes of both men were subjected to a thorough inspection. The Japanese personnel also ordered Mr. Lauder to open his mouth. After he opened it, they ordered, "Open it wider." When Mr. Lauder could not answer, the Japanese personnel stuffed his passport into his mouth, forcing him to open it even wider. Mr. Lauder's hair was also messed up. Finally, the Japanese personnel ordered the two men to spread their legs and inspected their crotches. Only then were they allowed to pass through. The search of the two men lasted for 15 minutes. In addition, it is confirmed that five British employees of the Beining Railway were also mistreated when they tried to cross the International Bridge to their office. Among them were Mr. Villiers, the chief engineer and general manager, and Mr. Borden, the chief accountant. These five people were accompanied by several Belgian and French nationals. The Belgian and French nationals were not harassed and passed through safely, while the British nationals were all stripped to the waist and their pockets were thoroughly searched. They were then ordered to take off their trousers and shoes before being released. These five British men are highly respected among the British community, but now they have been insulted in front of a group of Chinese coolies, which is regrettable. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Recent facts have revealed that brightly colored photos with large stamps are a treasure for passing through the Japanese military blockade, and their effectiveness is almost equal to the signature of an important person. The players at the Spanish pelota court in the Italian concession live in the British and French concessions. Recently, because the British and French concessions have been blockaded by the Japanese military, and they have to pass through the Japanese military barriers every day to go back and forth to the pelota court, it is necessary to prepare passports for the convenience of entry and exit. However, there is currently no Spanish consul in Tianjin, so it is not easy to obtain a formal passport. Subsequently, a certain resourceful player devised a clever plan to create and issue his own passport. The beauty and elegance of the style should be superior to the passports of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, these Spaniards followed the predetermined plan and used the red and green menus in the nightclub of the pelota court as signed card stock, and then pasted each person's photo on the menu, signed their fancy names, and stamped them with dazzling stamps. After the passport was made, a brave Spanish youth made a daring test. The Japanese sentry, seeing this exceptionally exquisite document, could not help but smile and let him pass without hindrance. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The details of the insult to British national Davis by the Japanese are as follows: When the Japanese insisted that he take off his clothes, Mr. Davis refused with a smile. A Japanese man then struck him in the mouth with his passport three times. Mr. Davis always replied with "Thank you." Thereupon, the Japanese man summoned three more Japanese men. Seeing this, Mr. Davis knew that continuing to insist would be ineffective, so he agreed to take off his clothes and stood naked for 15 minutes. At that time, several Chinese were standing around the search hut, and more than a dozen foreign women were passing by. Mr. Davis is 47 years old, 6 feet 3 inches tall, and has a burly physique. He showed great patience for this extreme insult. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, according to two foreigners who entered the concession, they saw the body of a Chinese man hanging on the electric wire barrier on Xinlu Road, on the edge of the concession, 500 yards from the entrance to Shanxi Road. The man looked like a coolie and his body was blue and yellow. This is the first person to die from electrocution after the concession was blockaded. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Today, the Kremlin continued its meetings, discussing the anti-aggression agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The meeting lasted for about half an hour before adjourning. Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, Deputy Foreign Commissar Potemkin, and External Affairs Representative Sterling all attended. It is heard that Molotov informed the British and French representatives that the Soviet Union still cannot accept the recently proposed amendments by Britain and France. Non-official sources currently believe that the content of the new British and French proposals still cannot satisfy the Soviet Union's insistence on providing solid guarantees to the Baltic states. However, this does not mean that the negotiations have broken down. The British and French representatives have reported the results of the meeting to London and Paris and will temporarily suspend the talks to await new instructions. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

It is rumored that Germany will provide the Soviet Union with a credit loan of 750 million marks, repayable in ten years, for the purpose of purchasing goods from Germany. In return, Germany will purchase large quantities of raw materials from the Soviet Union, such as timber, leather, and various oils.

According to reliable sources, the delegation is instructed to propose to the Soviet Union a German credit loan of 750 million marks, with a term of ten years, to be used for purchasing German goods. Germany is also prepared to purchase large quantities of raw materials from the Soviet Union, especially timber, leather, and oils.

Certain sources said that, while the British, French, and Soviet Union are continuing negotiations, it is not an appropriate time for the Soviet Union to conduct trade negotiations with Germany. However, after the Soviet Union signs an agreement with Britain and France, it is not impossible to sign an economic agreement with Germany. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union previously ordered a new-style cruiser from an Italian shipyard with a displacement of 8,500 tons. It has been completed and accepted by Soviet personnel and named the "Liov" and incorporated into the Baltic Fleet. Its name was mentioned in the newspapers for the first time during exercises from the 19th to the 22nd of this month. In addition, June 20th each year is the Soviet Navy Day. The goal of this year's celebration is to mobilize huge numbers of workers to build the Soviet Navy. Deputy People's Commissar of the Navy Rogov recently declared that 1939 is a very important year for the Soviet Navy. A number of new ships will be added. In addition, the Navy's recruitment of sailors has been very successful, and a number of sailors whose terms have expired have volunteered to continue their service, accounting for a quarter of the total. The newly established naval academy has 300 places, and there are more than 400 applicants. As the former Navy Day is about to begin, workers from all over the place should send delegations to Leningrad and Sevastopol to participate in the celebrations, "where they will be entertained on all the warships in our country, demonstrating the strength of the national navy."

Labor leader Greenwood moved that if President Roosevelt could break the old traditions and visit Britain or one of its dominions, he would also receive the same warm welcome. (Loud cheers) Greenwood continued, saying that the King's visit to the United States has opened a new page in the relationship between Britain and America, which proves that blood is thicker than water, and proves that the love of the people living under the banner of freedom and democracy is more intimate than before.

After Sir Bowes delivered a brief welcome speech, George VI immediately delivered a reply, saying, "The impression I have received from my travels to the north is that the people's hearts can influence the world situation in this age of mechanical civilization, the scale of production is so great that its power is far beyond the reach of other forces. According to historical records, it is unheard of for a British monarch to tour the Dominion of Canada. The completion of this trip by myself and the Queen is truly a pioneering event in history. I deeply hope that this trip will have a significant impact on the future of the British Empire. An American historian once said that a nation is also humankind, and this statement is indeed appropriate for the Americas. When I was in Canada, the symbols of the British royal family could be seen everywhere I went, not only that, but the British codes and cultures were also widely promoted. All of these are propagated by the freedom and justice we believe in, and their significance to us is even greater than the glory of our history and language. Moreover, the people of Canada are able to trust us, not only because of my personal visit with the Queen, but also because all the ethnic groups within the British Empire are able to enjoy civil liberties, and they are expressing their gratitude for this. I will certainly support the ideals of the various ethnic groups within the British Empire in order to demonstrate that these ideals are indeed the potential forces for promoting peace and establishing sincerity. My responsibility with the Queen is to fulfill them with all our strength," (Havas, 23rd)</p>

After the King spoke with Prime Minister Chamberlain, he and the Queen and Queen Mary walked in front of the cabinet members and diplomatic corps officials. The King and Queen immediately took a four-wheeled open carriage to Buckingham Palace, smiling and nodding to the crowds holding British and American flags and cheering along the road.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today sent separate letters to the Speakers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, requesting that the government be allowed to allocate US$3.5 billion, of which US$3 billion would be used to undertake various public works projects, and US$500 million would be used to subsidize foreign trade. This money is not intended to be included in the regular budget expenditure and will be raised through bond issuance. According to the President's view, once the various public works projects are completed and put into use, this money can be returned in succession. In the fiscal year of 1940, US$870 million can be raised through bonds for public works projects, and US$250 million can be raised through bonds for the development of foreign trade. According to the President's plan, the main goal is to stimulate the US economy and make it active again. There are two main points: one is to carry out public works projects to relieve unemployment, and the other is to allocate US$500 million to the Federal Import and Export Bank to develop foreign trade, so that various countries can enjoy the convenience of purchasing goods from the United States on credit. This will be beneficial to Latin American countries. The majority of Democratic members of Congress seem to be prepared to support the President's plan. Republican members of Congress regard it as a strategy for the next general election. A few conservative Democratic members of Congress have also adopted a reserved attitude. Democratic Senator Byrnes of Utah (who advocated an agreement with Britain and the Netherlands to exchange surplus cotton and wheat in the United States for rubber and tin) said that Congress should study President Roosevelt's plan. He will hold talks with the leaders of the two houses and consult with President Roosevelt to discuss everything. Democratic Senator King of Utah has expressed his disagreement with the plan, calling it a "groundless plan." Republican Senator Taft also expressed his opposition, saying that he does not support any plan to expand federal lending unless a special event occurs. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Rogers, a member of the Exchange Equalisation Account, will recently go to Chongqing and then return to England. If time does not permit, he will fly directly to England to report on China's financial changes. He will return to Hong Kong in a week or two, at which time Leith-Ross will accompany him again. The Hong Kong Government Gazette will publish a statement on the stabilization of the Chinese legal tender. After it is published, Rogers will make a major statement. The legal tender in Hong Kong has now risen to 44 [units of currency]. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Writers on financial issues have discussed the currency affairs of the Far East in detail, and many believe that the recent devaluation of the Chinese legal tender and the current Tianjin crisis are sufficient to shake confidence in China, and as a result, there will be an attempt to escape from the legal tender, so strict measures should be taken. However, London bankers have stated to Reuters that rumors that the Equalisation Account has been overly stressed are completely unfounded. Some even believe that the fund's management is still making far-sighted moves, aiming to squeeze out speculators. The Times said that in the current environment, the control of foreign exchange in China is far more complex than the control of foreign exchange elsewhere in the world. What is surprising is that China has encountered such obstacles, and even without implementing stricter measures, it can still maintain its currency exchange. Financial News said that the strengthening of the existing restrictions by the Japanese has not alarmed the circles in London and the Far East, because they believe that Japan's gold and foreign exchange are rapidly depleting. The newspaper also said that it is widely believed that Japan is now secretly planning for the flow of an informal market for the Japanese yen, hoping to encourage the use of devalued Japanese yen to increase invisible exports such as traveler traffic.

<p>(Tokyo) At 12:20 this afternoon, the Kwantung Army issued a bulletin stating that at 4:00 PM on Thursday, 150 Soviet aircraft flew across the "Manchukuo" border and appeared in the sky over Kanzhuo (transliteration) on the north bank of Lake Ber. Eighteen Japanese aircraft immediately took off and shot down 49 Soviet aircraft. The Japanese also lost five aircraft. Since the Nomonhan Incident, the Mongolian and Soviet aircraft have constantly challenged the "Manchukuo" Japanese army. On June 19, more than a dozen Soviet aircraft repeatedly crossed the border to bomb the Halo Nurshal Kanzhuo Temple, Ankolo, and Jiaha Temple (all transliterations) in the "Manchukuo" territory on the north bank of Lake Ber. Afterwards, the "Manchukuo" Japanese army prepared to pay close attention to the actions of the Soviet and Mongolian forces. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports here, regarding the "invasion" of the "Manchukuo" border by the Mongolian Air Force yesterday, which resulted in a fierce battle with the Japanese Air Force, which resulted in the shooting down of 49 Mongolian aircraft and the loss of five Japanese aircraft, the "Manchukuo" government has protested to Mongolia, saying that if such "border crossing" incidents are not stopped, Japan and "Manchukuo" will take the most drastic retaliatory measures.

<h3 id="e27">The Result of Two Years of Sino-Japanese War: The Chinese Are United; The Japanese Get More Than They Bargained For <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Red Star newspaper published an article today analyzing the results of the Sino-Japanese War in two years, saying, "The Japanese warlords' strategic plan to quickly defeat and encircle the Chinese army has failed. In the course of the war, the Chinese army has not only increased in number, but has also become a unified entity with excellent morale, high combat effectiveness, and unified command. The Japanese have attempted to divide the unity of the Chinese people, but this attempt has also failed. "What have the Japanese gained in two years of war, at the cost of more than 800,000 casualties? Only 12% of Chinese territory, and even in this area, there are still one million Chinese guerrillas and 80 regular divisions engaged in activities, making the Japanese control of the occupied areas extremely weak. At the same time, the price paid by Japanese imperialism for this harvest is also extremely large. The prolongation of the war of aggression against China has brought Japan's economic life to the brink of bankruptcy. Military expenditure has consumed more than half of the country's gold reserves. Due to the extreme lack of raw materials for military use and daily necessities, the total amount of national debt has increased sharply, and taxes have also increased several times. The people's dissatisfaction with the war is growing, and anti-war sentiment has recently spread throughout the army. "From this point of view, the Chinese people have every reason to believe that although they have lost a part of their territory, the victors are now also on their side. "The Chinese people are now united, have passed through the stage of strategic withdrawal, and are entering the stage of accumulating strength and preparing for a general counter-offensive. They have gained the sympathy of all progressive mankind, and they have deep confidence in the final victory. (TASS, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e30">West River in Guangdong Province Rises; Southwest Roads Become More Secure; Rumor Claims Japanese Army Plans to Take Advantage of the Rising Water to Invade Guangxi, But This is Probably Impossible in Reality <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence, Guangxi Inland, Every year during the turn of spring and summer, continuous rain and mountain floods cause the rivers to rise. Ships can navigate everywhere. Since the beginning of summer this year, heavy rains have fallen in Guilin, Yong, Liuzhou, Longzhou, Baise, Yulin, and other areas, causing the Lijiang River, Liujiang River, Yongjiang River, and the rivers of Baise and Longzhou to rise simultaneously. Since mid-May, electric ships traveling from Wuzhou to Guilin, Liuzhou, or Nanning have been able to navigate directly, greatly facilitating transportation. However, most of the Guangxi highways have been destroyed. The benefit of the weather and rain can be used as a remedy for transportation after the destruction of various highways.</p>
<p>After the rivers in Guangxi Province have flooded, there is a rumor that the Japanese army is preparing to invade westward, or that the Japanese army will use its shallow-draft ships and iron-hulled sailboats to sail upstream to capture Wuzhou. However, judging from the terrain of the West River waterway, although the water level is high, the rise and fall of the water level in the upper reaches is quite rapid. If it rains heavily for ten days without stopping, it can rise more than ten feet or even ten feet overnight. Conversely, it can fall to the same level in a few days. Moreover, above Zhaoqing, the water is rapid and the shoals are treacherous; above Wuzhou, the reefs are jagged and scattered all over the riverbed, which can serve as a natural barrier for military purposes. From a military perspective, according to information obtained in the lower half of May and the first half of June, the Japanese army along the banks of Jiujiang, Shatou, Makou, Hekou, and Sanshui has less than 5,000 troops. In Jiangmen, Xinhui, Heshan, and other places, excluding puppet troops, the regular Japanese army is also less than 3,000 troops. In Guangzhou, less than 20,000 troops are assigned to northern Guangdong and the eastern routes. In total, the Japanese army stationed in Guangdong, including all army, navy, and air force branches, is actually less than three divisions. If they were to rashly attempt a westward invasion, it would be impossible in terms of strength.</p>
<p>On the southern front, Japanese warships have been moving unpredictably along the coast recently. For the sake of preparedness, the Chinese authorities have implemented martial law along the coast of Gaolei from the 10th of this month, including Zha Po, Shuidong, Meicha, Xuwen, Suixi Jianghong, Anpu, Shankou, and other areas. In all martial law areas along the coast, the population is thoroughly evacuated according to the scorched earth policy, and food, livestock, and all materials are moved away. Outgoing passengers are strictly inspected. Recently, General Xia Wei, commander-in-chief of a certain group army, has dispatched crack troops commanded by two generals from Guilin to Qinzhou and Lianzhou to assist the special garrison area troops in jointly defending the southern coastal route. At the same time, Liang Hansong, commander of the Yongning militia area, and Long Zhenyi, deputy commander of the Yulin militia area, were ordered to lead some elite militia to the southern route to deploy defenses in key areas along the Guangdong-Guangxi border, so that in the event of an emergency, they can quickly join the coastal troops to block the enemy head-on.</p>
<h3 id="e31">League of Nations Advisor, Hydraulic Expert, Puteli Deng, Dies in Accident; Drowned While Surveying Water Conservancy on the Jinsha River; Capsized Boat at Laojundong <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Kunming Airlines News, The Jinsha River, also known as the Yangtze River, has a very long basin. Navigation is unimpeded and transportation is convenient in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Sichuan. Only in the Yunnan border area, the water is turbulent, the shoals are large, and there are many rocks, making it impossible to navigate ships. Over the years, the government has sent personnel to survey and improve the situation, but without any results. Recently, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Communications specially hired League of Nations consultant and hydraulic expert Puteli, along with technician Zhang Jiong, the Southwest Transportation Office water conservancy survey committee member Hu Yunzhou, and a group of eight people, to survey the water conservancy of the Jinsha River. They encountered an accident when they were going to Laojundong, only the sailor Yan Mengyuan was rescued. After the two ministries and the provincial government heard the news, they sent personnel to investigate the truth one after another, and ordered the counties along the river to search for the corpses. On the 28th of last month, they sent Yan Mengyuan to point out the location. Later, a corpse was found near Xintang Bay in Qiaojia County. It was so rotten that it could not be identified. A badge of the Ministry of Communications No. 71, a drawing eraser, and a Chinese knife were found on his body. After detailed investigation, the badge was worn by Advisor Pu. The body of Pu was transported to the province the day before yesterday. Zhang Yuanshan, a member of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, heard the news and immediately transferred Pu's body to Kunhua Hospital. Representatives of Pu's family, Du Lu, a representative of the League of Nations Anti-epidemic Committee, and Chinese and Western doctors examined the body. A gold ring with Pu's name engraved on it was found on Pu's finger. There were no wounds on the body, confirming that he had drowned. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to report the details, and a reply was sent that the ministry would be responsible for Pu's coffin, burial, and post-mortem compensation, and requested the National Government to commend him. Du Lu approved. It is planned to transport Pu's coffin back to Holland for burial within a few days.</p>

<p>Qingpu Correspondence, Since the emergence of the China Development Bank, the Japanese army stationed in Qingpu has forced the public to use counterfeit currency. However, the public does not trust it. Therefore, except for purchasing bus tickets and obtaining passes with counterfeit currency, legal tender is still generally used. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese army stationed in Qingpu ordered the puppet organization to notify the public that from the 20th of this month, they are not allowed to carry legal tender out of the country, and those who violate this will be severely punished. Therefore, Qingpu commerce has been extremely chaotic recently, and several businesses must have closed down.</p>

<p>A General Warning to Other Accomplices</p>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence, Wang Youzhi, the puppet magistrate of Kunshan, organized a puppet rent and tax office last year and appointed Xie Anbo as the puppet director to collect land taxes. However, after the farmers were robbed, very few of them paid their rent and taxes. Seeing that it was ineffective, Wang Youzhi assigned a large number of puppet officials to set up branch offices in the countryside to force payment in coordination with the puppet police. Liu Chengzhang, the chief of the Pengjian Township puppet branch office, had served as the director of the county government's land tax office before the war. This time, when Xie Anbo came to power, Liu also willingly acted as a demonic dog, oppressing the villagers on weekdays and acting as a tiger's henchman, his arrogance was immense. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly arrested by the puppet detective team the day before yesterday, allegedly on suspicion of embezzling funds. He is now detained in the puppet detective team, awaiting investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Zhejiang Provincial Government Administration Situation Ruan Yicheng's Report at the Provincial Council <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondence, Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, reported on the department's administration at the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Council on May 1 this year. A brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative organization. The wartime administrative organization should be simple in structure, centralized in power, and flexible in operation. Therefore, this province has determined that the commissioner's office at the commissioner level is supervisory and guiding in nature, and formulated the criteria for exercising its powers. The application of both peacetime and wartime powers is clearly stipulated. The commissioner's office and the district command headquarters are merged to form an organization to achieve military and political unity. The division of the previous administrative inspectorate districts is not entirely consistent with the current military situation. In the western Zhejiang area, the enemy and we restrain each other, and the counties under the jurisdiction of each district must be re-divided according to military geography in order to facilitate command. Therefore, the counties under the jurisdiction of the original first, third, and fourth districts are redistributed based on railways, highways, money, and the Qiantang River. With the consent of the provincial party headquarters, the commissioners of the first, second, and third districts concurrently serve as party affairs instructors in their respective districts to achieve the effect of unifying the party, government, and army.</p>
<p>At the county government level, the counties in the province are first divided into two types, A and B, which are the types of counties, and each type is further divided into three classes and six grades, which are the grades of counties. All counties in the guerrilla area are designated as Type A counties, and the provincial government will designate these counties from time to time according to the actual situation. The rest are Type B counties. Type A counties focus on being able to cooperate with guerrilla warfare and compete with the enemy for the people. Therefore, their establishment does not need to be greatly expanded. The county government should focus on command, and the execution of administrative orders should be assigned to various districts, townships, and towns, so that each unit can be enriched and used as the basis for political offensive. At the beginning of the fall of western Zhejiang, all county magistrates retreated to the rear. At one time, action committees were set up or two counties were jointly established. Most of the responsible persons also lingered and did not move forward. However, the people have a long-standing understanding of the county government and the county magistrate. If the action committee and the chairman are generally unaware of its meaning, they cannot follow the orders of the county government. Moreover, the organization of the county government is China's unified official system. Although the county territory has fallen, this local administrative agency should have been withdrawn or changed its name. Now the establishment of the various Type A county governments are all the same, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the guerrilla area. As for the establishment of the various Type B counties, it should vary according to the grade of the county.</p>
<p>The county is an autonomous unit, and the county government is the basic core for the implementation of all government orders. In the past, due to the lack of unified upper-level agencies, there were too many independent agencies within a county, or the county magistrate held another position concurrently, and things were not unified, expenses were wasted, and conflicts and friction occurred. All of this was caused by this. Now that the province has uniformly abolished bureaus and changed them to sections, and this year the command headquarters in various counties have been abolished and changed to military sections, which are incorporated into the county government. The county magistrate still holds the title of commander, and the deputy commander concurrently serves as the chief of the military section, so as to facilitate the command of the teams, and military administration has been integrated with the general county administration. It is a pity that various special laws and regulations and matters related to central laws and regulations cannot be completely concentrated for a while, and the number of positions that the county magistrate concurrently holds according to law is still around twenty.</p>
<p>(2) Administrative expenses. The expenses of the commissioner's office cum district security command headquarters and the Type A county government are fully paid by the provincial treasury according to the provincial establishment estimate. The administrative expenses of the Type B county government vary according to the county level. As a rule, the provincial treasury also allocates subsidies to the administrative expenses of various counties. The amount of subsidies also varies according to the county level. Because the first-class counties are large counties with better local wealth, the provincial subsidies are also more. The second- and third-class counties are already barren, and the subsidies are less, so it is difficult to achieve balanced development. Therefore, this year, the amount of administrative expenses of each county will still be determined according to the county level, but the provincial subsidies will be changed to be based on the amount of local revenue in the county. For counties with local revenue of 300,000 yuan or more, the administrative expenses of the county government will be fully paid by the county and no subsidies will be provided. For those with 250,000 yuan or more and less than 300,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-fifth of the total administrative expenses of the county government. For those with 100,000 yuan or more and less than 250,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-quarter. For those with 150,000 yuan or more and less than 200,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-third. For those with 100,000 yuan or more and less than 150,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize one-half. For those with 50,000 yuan or more and less than 100,000 yuan, the provincial government will subsidize two-thirds. For those with less than 50,000 yuan, the provincial government will pay all expenses. It is estimated that the total amount of county administrative expenses subsidized by the provincial government throughout the year is 1,121,073 yuan, an increase of 341,573 yuan compared to the previous year. The expenses of the district office are purely county funds, but counties in or near the war zone are also subsidized by the province. In the past, each county included the expenses of the district office under the item of autonomous expenses, which was a misunderstanding of the nature of the district office. It has recently been corrected at any time and ordered to be included in administrative expenses.</p>
<p>The expenses of the townships, towns, bao, and jia in each county were mostly based on the autonomous household donation of each county in the past. The donation rate was at least one cent per month or one yuan per year, and the maximum could not exceed three yuan per month. Although various methods for raising, compiling, and inspecting were also formulated, the compilation and inspection were unfair, the collection was cumbersome, and the township and town chiefs' own collection and use were the biggest drawbacks. Starting from this year, the autonomous household donations of each county will be abolished, and 20% of the autonomous expenses will be collected according to the standards of the land tax and general business tax and deposited into the provincial treasury for unified provincial payment. A total of 1,096,366 yuan can be collected throughout the year. Another 100,000 yuan will be allocated from the provincial treasury, making a total of 1.2 million yuan. 200,000 yuan will be used to offset the compulsory education expenses of the original autonomous household donations, and another 1 million yuan will be allocated according to the number of townships, towns, bao, and jia in each county. All outstanding autonomous household donations before the 24th year of the Republic of China will be exempted. The outstanding amounts from the 25th, 26th, and 27th years will be allowed to be collected by the end of June of this year, and will also be exempted if they are overdue, in order to alleviate the people's hardships. The previous collection of autonomous household donations by household was actually limited to the bao and jia system, which was based on households. In fact, in the countryside, those who bear the burden by household and by land are the same, but bearing it by land is fairer. There is now another kind of autonomous surcharge levied on each mu of land in each county. The total province is 500,000 yuan a year, and it is planned to incorporate it into the provincial autonomous expenses in the future for unified revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>(3) Administrative employment. The examination and selection of county magistrates are the responsibility of the central government, and the provincial government is not in a position to handle it. The Department of Civil Affairs has handled the performance appraisal of county magistrates in the 27th year. At this time of the war of resistance, it is bound to pay more attention to military affairs. The content of the performance appraisal includes civil affairs, finance, construction, education, security, accounting, justice, conscription, social training, resistance to the enemy and self-defense, and national corvée, each with different percentages. The competent authorities have successively sent the scores and are about to start calculating the total score. However, if the county magistrate has not been in office for three months on the day of the performance appraisal, he will not be included in the performance appraisal according to the regulations. The appointment of assistant county officials in each county has been almost completely authorized to the county magistrate after the war of resistance. Except for accounting personnel who are directly dispatched by the provincial accounting office due to the independent accounting system, even the police chiefs and police assistants who were originally appointed by the province are now appointed by the county magistrate himself. However, due to the suspension of personnel selection and review, the use of personnel in each county is inevitably chaotic. The powers of the county magistrate during the war should be increased, but the laws of the country cannot be violated. Therefore, the province's Personnel Selection and Review Committee has resumed work, selecting and reviewing administrative personnel at all levels below the province, cultivating new cadres on the one hand to make talent available and gain security, and also formulating various rectification measures to correct this bad habit.</p>
<p>(4) Work supervised by the Department of Civil Affairs. In addition to what has been discussed in the above three sections, the management of food was transferred to the Department of Construction by order of the provincial government last autumn. This year, a Wartime Food Management Committee was established, with the chairman serving as the director.</p>
<p>Regarding disaster relief administration, this province has established the Zhejiang Provincial Disaster Relief Association for handling. However, the organization of disaster relief funds and property, and the management of provincial orphanages, are still decided by the provincial government to be handled by the Department of Civil Affairs. Recently, the Central Disaster Relief Committee ordered that social relief work should still be promoted by the Department of Civil Affairs at any time and listed as a regular and continuous task. All disaster relief and other matters must be promoted, utilized, and guided by the Department of Civil Affairs. This seems to conflict with Article 4 of the organizational regulations of the Provincial Disaster Relief Association promulgated by the central government. The current application for interpretation is in progress on how to divide the powers. Regarding conscription, although the investigation and control of strong men, the preferential treatment of families of soldiers in the expeditionary force, and the management of personnel in charge of conscription in the county are still the responsibility of the Department of Civil Affairs, the conscription of soldiers, the allocation of military quotas for each county, the organization and training of the national army, and the payment of money to delay military service are the responsibility of the military district command headquarters. However, the interpretation of conscription laws and regulations will still be handled jointly. Regarding police administration, and the prohibition of smoking and drugs, everything is handled in accordance with central laws and regulations. The police officers of the provincial police bureau and the provincial police training institute who withdrew from Hangzhou were mostly reorganized into anti-defense detachments to take on national defense tasks. The two inland and offshore water police bureaus have also directly participated in combat.</p>
<p>As for household registration, land administration, accounting, hygiene, and other tasks, the Department of Civil Affairs has paid close attention to them and implemented them separately.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Overview of Northwest Fujian Products; Northwest Fujian Plays an Important Role in Wartime Material Supply <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence, The northwestern parts of Fujian Province, located in the interior of the province, have always been known as desolate and impoverished. After the efforts of the local authorities to develop them, they have now become a vigorous and prosperous place. Moreover, since the important cities along the southeastern coast of Fujian have been completely designated as war zones after the War of Resistance, all political, economic, industrial, cultural, and other undertakings have moved to the interior. Therefore, northwestern Fujian currently occupies a more important position in the supply of materials during the war. The following is a description based on the findings of the investigation:</p>
<p>Rice Production</p>
<p>Most counties in northwestern Fujian are rich in rice. Among them, Pucheng, Chong'an, Jianyang, Shaowu, Taining, Jianning, Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu are the nine counties with an absolute surplus. Songxi, Zhenghe, Shunchang, Jiangle, and Ningyang are the five self-sufficient counties. As for the counties with insufficient rice production, the first is Jian'ou, where the shortage of food is not very serious. Jian'ou has a population of more than 300,000. Compared with its grain production, it is short of more than 10,000 dan of rice every year. However, it is the center of grain transportation in northern Fujian. Jieshou, Changping Street, Masha, and Jukou in Jianyang, Jiangkou and Xingtian in Chong'an, and Linjiang, Shibi, Xianyang, and Fuling in Pucheng are its supply areas. Dikou, Fangcun Pass, Yanping County, Xiadao, Zhanghuban, Yunxi Pass, and Fuzhou are its sales areas. Rice passing through Jian'ou is at least 100,000 shi (140 catties per shi) or more per year, so the lack of grain is not very serious. The other is Yangkou. Yangkou used to be a special zone, but now it is the seat of the third district office in Shunchang. It is also short of no less than several thousand dan of rice every year. However, Yangkou is also the center of grain transportation. Jianning, Taining, Jiangle, and Shunchang are its supply areas. Yanping, Xiadao, Zhanghuban, and Fuzhou are its sales areas. Rice passing through Yangkou is at least 50,000 shi or more per year, so the lack of grain is also not very serious. In addition, there are the sparrow boats from Minqing, which are also the largest center for transporting grain. Guangze, Yanshan, Gushan, Tieluoxiang, Nakou, Shuikouzai, and Dagan are its supply areas, and Fuzhou, Yanping, Xiadao, and Zhanghuban are its sales areas. The annual transportation of rice is at least 80,000 to 90,000 dan or more. The only counties that are completely short of rice are Nanping, Shaxian, Yong'an, Liancheng, and Changting. Nanping has many mountains and few fields. The rice produced each year is only enough for three months. Shaxian is short of 76,000 dan of rice every year. At present, the population in the urban area and Sanyuan and other places has suddenly increased by 6,000 to 7,000 people, making the shortage even more acute. Yong'an has always been short of rice. Since Xiaotao, which produces rice, was placed under the jurisdiction of Ningyang, the shortage of rice has become even worse. Liancheng and Changting will inevitably face a rice shortage unless they rely on the assistance of Ninghua, Qingliu, and Mingxi.</p>
<p>Bean Production</p>
<p>There are two types of beans: green beans and soybeans. Soybeans are produced in Jian'ou, Jiangle, Taining, and other places. Most of the green beans are produced in Jiangxi. Every year in November and December of the lunar calendar, large quantities of green beans are transported from Jiangxi to Peicheng, Ninghua, and other places for sale. After selling them, they buy some sugar, salt, flour, etc., and transport them back to Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Water Bamboo Shoot Production</p>
<p>There are two types of water bamboo shoots: winter water bamboo shoots and spring water bamboo shoots. Winter water bamboo shoots are those that are baked within December, and spring water bamboo shoots are those that are baked from January to March. The annual production of winter water bamboo shoots in northern Fujian is 400,000 catties, and the annual production of spring water bamboo shoots is 700,000 catties. Winter water bamboo shoots are best when they are produced on snowy days. The more snow, the thicker the water bamboo shoots. This year is a lean year, and the production is not abundant. Currently, the market price in Yangkou is 120 yuan per 100 catties of winter water bamboo shoots. The most abundant areas for water bamboo shoot production are Shunchang, Jian'ou, and Shaowu. Jian'ou and Yangkou are the two major water bamboo shoot markets in northern Fujian.</p>
<p>Bamboo Shoot Production</p>
<p>Bamboo shoot production is dominated by dried bamboo shoots. Dried bamboo shoots can be divided into black bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot slices. Black bamboo shoots are those that are produced before the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar, and bamboo shoot slices are those that are produced after the Dragon Boat Festival. In addition, there is a kind of magnolia petal, which is dried at the same time as the spring water bamboo shoots in January of the lunar calendar. Nanping produces more than 20,000 dan per year. Shunchang, Jian'ou, and Jianyang each produce 5,000 to 6,000 dan. Shaowu and Jianning have the least production.</p>
<p>Oil Production</p>
<p>Every year after the Frost's Descent in the lunar calendar, it is the time for northern Fujian to manufacture tea oil and collect tea products. After the tea oil is produced, tung oil is continuously refined. Pucheng, Chong'an, Shaxian, Jian'ou, and other places are all rich in production.</p>

<p>Wang's Mother Commits Suicide as a Result</p>
<p>Nantong Correspondence, The Japanese puppets in Tongcheng, in view of the fact that Chinese patriots are very active in the city, have recently dispatched a large number of military police, led by traitors, to search the residences of people who have previously worked in various government agencies. Double posts are set up at each important intersection to prohibit pedestrians from passing through, in order to prevent Chinese patriots from hiding upon hearing the news. In the residence of Mr. Wang, a teacher at a certain elementary school in Chengxi outside the South Gate, several magazines and books published in Shanghai before the war of resistance were searched and taken away. At that time, Mr. Wang was out on business, so he was not caught, but his female relatives, who were young and beautiful, were all humiliated. Afterwards, Mr. Wang's family complained about the atrocity to Xu Yuchun, a member of the puppet organization committee in the urban area, but Xu dismissed it with a smile because the Japanese army had planned to attack the north to capture Shijiao but failed, losing the favor of the Japanese side, and he was unable to appeal for them. Mr. Wang's mother, because she was so humiliated and could not get redress, immediately committed suicide. The people in the urban area were all resentful when they heard about it. It was also heard that on that day, during the time when the Japanese army announced martial law, Wang Shaoqing, the head of the puppet organization center Fang, tried to pass through forcibly, and was slapped several times by the Japanese military police. Wang could only retreat with a mournful cry.</p>

<p>A total of 258 graduates (122 from senior high and 135 from junior high) from the various senior and junior high schools of the Shanghai Baptist Association, including Yates Memorial Girls' School, Mingqiang Middle School, Jinde Girls' School, the Affiliated Middle School of Shanghai University, Huiling Girls' School, Hudong Middle School of Hudong Commune, and Yancheng Middle School, held a joint graduation ceremony at the Great Shanghai Cinema at 9 a.m. on the 23rd. Over 1,220 people attended, including school board members, faculty, staff, parents of students, guests, and the graduates themselves. The theater was filled to capacity. Party and national flags were hung on the stage, and many pots of flowers were arranged, creating a solemn and beautiful atmosphere. Details of the event are as follows:</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Meeting</p>
<p>The meeting began at 9 a.m. with music played by Ms. Bai Lude. Guests, school board members, faculty, staff, and graduates took their seats. Then, all students and staff sang the hymn "Beautiful China." Pastor Fan Er delivered a prayer. Chairman Dr. Li Haoshan gave the opening address. The entire audience sang the hymn "Great Is Thy Faithfulness." Lin Kanghou delivered a speech. Ms. Li Meiyu performed a piano solo. Dr. Liang Gen delivered a speech. Principals of each school presented diplomas. Zhao Jinqing gave a speech. Graduates of each school sang the graduation song. Pastor Wang Chenghao delivered a benediction. A photograph was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Record of Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Chairman Dr. Li Haoshan's opening address briefly stated: "Today marks the occasion of the joint graduation ceremony of the seven Baptist senior and junior high schools. We are very grateful for the presence of the school board members, distinguished guests, and parents. We are also thankful to the Great Shanghai Cinema for providing a spacious venue, which is greatly appreciated. We operate our schools based on educational principles and the various decrees promulgated by the central government, cultivating young people and establishing an educational foundation for the nation. Some of the schools present have a history of thirty to forty years. We dare not boast about our past achievements, but we trust that they have been recognized by the public. We will continue to adhere to our planned educational program and develop our schools. This year's graduating class from the seven schools totals 258 senior and junior high students. While this represents the achievements of the schools in one year, the cause of education is constantly progressing. Therefore, we hope that the senior and junior high graduates will continue their studies and not be complacent after graduation. We also hope that all the esteemed guests present today will offer guidance and contributions. We are immensely grateful." (2) Lin Kanghou's speech briefly stated: "In such times and in such an environment, I feel fortunate to be able to participate in such a well-organized and solemn joint graduation ceremony of seven schools. I believe all those present share the same sentiment. You are now graduating, but I believe there is no such thing as graduation in this world. As the saying goes, 'One is never too old to learn.' This is merely the completion of a stage of study in senior or junior high school. After this temporary graduation, your paths will diverge due to the differing family circumstances. Some will pursue further education, while others will enter the workforce. And within further education and employment, choices will vary according to individual interests. In this era of academic competition, one cannot stand alone without learning. Those who can strive should pursue higher learning. Guidance for further education relies on school teachers and parents, and students should also make a firm decision based on their aptitudes in order to choose their field of study. Those who cannot pursue further education and enter the workforce will come into contact with society. They should not only focus on academics but also pay attention to the ways of the world. I now present the eight virtues of the American International Society for Ethical Culture—'Sincerity, Integrity, Selflessness, and Universal Love'—to all graduates as a motto. Whether you pursue further education or enter the workforce, if you practice these eight virtues, you will benefit immensely throughout your life." (3) Dr. Liang Gen delivered a speech in English, saying that studying is like a clock, with its gears constantly turning without stopping. You should not stop just because you have temporarily graduated. You should constantly strive for self-improvement. He also said that young people have weak wills and should be cautious and maintain self-control to avoid going astray. (4) Zhao Jinqing's address briefly stated: "I have an indirect relationship with the school, so I am not worthy of delivering this speech. I will just say a few words. In these difficult times, how fortunate you are to be able to study peacefully and graduate. You have already gained general knowledge from your middle school education. At the age of twenty, you are considered masters of the country under civil law. Senior high school graduates are gradually approaching society. Given the current social and economic conditions in China, it is not easy to receive a senior high school education. Since you have had the privilege of receiving secondary education, you should understand your responsibilities to the country, your family, and society. Do not be lazy or wasteful. You should uphold the spirit of Christianity, not be selfish, and expand your concern to others. As the saying goes, 'He is a man, and I am a man.' Those who strive can achieve great things."</p>

<h3 id="e40">Charity Basketball for Banking and Finance Industries: Baolian and Guoguang Draw; Mixed Team Defeats Banking and Finance Joint Team; Youyou Will Play Banking and Insurance Joint Team Tonight <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The charity basketball tournament organized by the Banking and Insurance Amateur Association was held last night at the Zhongqing Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. In the first women's match, Xiangying was behind by four to six points in the first half. Unexpectedly, after the break, Xiangying's Rong Shujian and Xi Xun continuously scored, and the score soared, eventually winning by a score of twenty to eight. The second match was originally between Chizhi and Yinlian. Chizhi, due to the pressure of exams, was enthusiastic about this charity match but was ultimately constrained by circumstances, so only Zhang Liangxiong attended. Chizhi's coach, Wen Zongyuan, felt apologetic. A mixed team was temporarily organized by inviting Xufang team members to play against Yinlian. As a result, Yinlian's shooting was not consistent, with only Li Zhenzhong holding the fort. Although they led by 18 to 13 in the first half, they lost to the mixed team in the second half with a close score of 36 to 40 due to the rise of Mixed's Lu Dazhen. In the final match between Baolian and Guoguang, Guoguang initially flowed smoothly, with Chen Hongqi and Wang Nanqun scoring five points with dribbling, throwing, and free throws. Baolian struggled and finally scored a goal by Chen Xuechong. Later, they increased the score to nine to two, which was Guoguang's best period. After fourteen to nine, Baolian recovered and surpassed with seventeen to fourteen in an instant, leading by twenty-one to eighteen in the first half. In the second half, Baolian relied on Lu Gusui's activity, and the score increased to twenty-five to eighteen and twenty-nine to twenty-four. Unexpectedly, Guoguang revived and twice caught up to twenty-nine, thirty-one, and thirty-three points each. In between, they also surpassed twice with thirty-one to twenty-nine and thirty-five to thirty-three. Until the last minute, Baolian relied on Xi Lin and Xuechong's two throws, resulting in a thirty-five tie. Just as they were about to make further progress, the final whistle sounded. The second charity match will continue tonight at 7 p.m., with an even more exciting schedule. The final match between the Banking and Insurance Joint Team and Youyou is like a battle for the title between two giants in Shanghai. Tickets cost six jiao.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association held a committee meeting at Xiqing to discuss the resumption of this year's Intercity Swimming Championships. The meeting concluded that the sharp decline in foreign exchange makes it impossible for the Shanghai team to travel to Hong Kong. It would be easy for the Hong Kong team to come to Shanghai. At the same time, due to the special environment in Tianjin, it is also difficult to participate in the event. Therefore, Tianjin will not be able to participate in this year's Intercity Championships. It is only possible to consult with Hong Kong and ask them to come to Shanghai, which would be easier to arrange. As for the water polo league, seven teams will participate in this year's competition: two teams from Dongselei, two teams from Xiqing, two teams from the Rowing Club, and one team from the French Chamber of Commerce. The competition will begin in early July. The Intercity Swimming Competition was last held in Tianjin in 1936. It was suspended due to the August 13th incident, and has been discontinued for two years.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Finance Cash Black Market Opened Yesterday; Bullish Traders Hampered by Limited Liquidity; Volume Only Exceeded Four Hundred Taels <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash silver bullion black market situation was unpredictable, fluctuating constantly. Generally, it rose and fell, ultimately falling again. This was entirely dependent on foreign exchange rates and buying/selling momentum. Initially, due to the previous day's order restricting withdrawals of soft currency deposits and rumors of a sharp depreciation of foreign exchange, sentiment tended downward. Furthermore, some small, undercapitalized bullish speculators were being pressured to repay loans, leading them to urgently sell off holdings. Consequently, the market opened lower at 2,570 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver firm, acting on behalf of a wealthy bullish trader, aggressively bought over one hundred taels, pushing the price to a high of 2,620 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued depreciation of foreign exchange, the resurgence of selling interest among money exchange houses, and the constraint on buyers due to a shortage of cash, making activity difficult, the price returned to the 2,600 yuan level, once retreating to a low of 2,560 yuan. Afterwards, the underlying trend stabilized, gradually becoming stagnant. As a result, there was a significant drop of 107 yuan. Although there were no large transactions, fluctuations of twenty yuan or more were common. Trading was quiet, with only over three hundred taels traded in the morning and only one hundred taels in the afternoon. Silver jewelry also fell by ten yuan. Customs gold remained stable, while British pure gold, etc., rose slightly.</p>
<p>Bullion Drops 107 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening prices for each bar (ten taels) were met with a wait-and-see attitude. Around 9:30 a.m., upon hearing news of a weakening foreign exchange rate, sentiment grew more pessimistic. Sellers directly lowered offers from 2,600 yuan to 2,560 or 2,570 yuan, yet still struggled to find buyers, mainly due to a lack of cash. Around 10:30 a.m., a certain silver firm suddenly began to accumulate on behalf of a wealthy client, and transactions were seen. A certain silver firm purchased fifty taels from a money exchange house at a price of 2,570 yuan, which was 19 yuan less than the small silver dollar rate on Tuesday of this week. Subsequently, gold firms traded amongst themselves for twenty taels at a price of 575 yuan. Although the foreign exchange rate was weakening, a certain silver firm's buying interest remained strong, with an upward underlying trend. A certain silver firm purchased fifty taels from a fellow trader at a price that jumped 25 yuan to 600 yuan. Soon after, a certain silver firm sold ten taels back to a gold firm at a price that leapt another 20 yuan to 620 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued strengthening of foreign exchange, a selling trend emerged, but the decline was also sharp, dropping 19 yuan instantly. A certain money exchange house sold one hundred taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 601 yuan. Subsequently, another money exchange house also started selling, and the price broke below the 600 yuan level. A money exchange house sold fifty taels to a silver firm at a price of 590 yuan. At this time, buyers were scarce, and the price plunged another 25 yuan. A money exchange house sold twenty taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 565 yuan. Following this, a money exchange house unloaded thirty taels to a silver firm at a price of 560 yuan. By this time, it was 11:30 a.m. No further trading was heard, so the noon closing price remained at 560 yuan. The market opened around 2:00 p.m., trading higher than the noon closing price by 5 yuan. Money exchange houses traded fifty taels amongst themselves at a price of 565 yuan. Subsequently, a gold firm purchased twenty taels from a money exchange house at a price of 570 yuan. Later, money exchange houses again traded fifty taels amongst themselves at a price of 565 yuan. At 3:00 p.m., a silver firm unloaded ten taels to a money exchange house at a price of 562 yuan. Afterwards, there were buyers at 565 yuan, but sellers waited, resulting in no transactions for a long time. The evening closing price was still 2,562 yuan, a sharp drop of 107 yuan compared to Tuesday of this week, fluctuating 60 yuan throughout the day. The cash gold firms' benchmark gold price was 10 yuan higher than the bullion price. The spot gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Also Drops Ten Yuan in a Row</p>
<p>The initial offering price for silver jewelry from major silver shops was still 270 yuan per tael. Around 10:00 a.m., upon hearing that there was a formalized market price for bullion trading, with prices falling by about 100 yuan, they all lowered prices to small eight yuan. Later, until 2:00 p.m., they lowered prices again by small two yuan. It is estimated that major silver firms changed the offered price to 260 yuan, new silver firms to 258 yuan, and the purchasing price to 252 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Suddenly Increases by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 22nd dispatch: British pure gold suddenly increased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6½d. As a result, the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash also rose to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed Customs gold price remained stable, at 1.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also rose by four jiao, reaching 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Japanese Bank Suddenly Started Selling Foreign Exchange; Bullish Traders Hastened to Liquidate; Exchange Rate Became More Soft <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed rates. In the black market, the Japanese Bank suddenly started aggressively selling, with the Yokohama Specie Bank offering the most. Some Chinese merchants and the Central Bank, etc., affected by the cash shortage, continued to liquidate, and the selling pressure was quite intense. Furthermore, Western merchant house Sassoon also unloaded a large amount, and foreign banks' appetite was not strong, resulting in a temporary oversupply that was several times greater than demand. Therefore, the weakening trend was quite sharp. At one point, the British gold rate fell to as low as 6 5/16 d 8125, and the US dollar rate was once quoted as high as 13.25 yuan. Later, the sellers' willingness to supply lessened, and Western merchant house Sassoon also stopped unloading and began to buy on the cheap, so the situation softened slightly. However, there were many twists and turns in between, but there were no overly large fluctuations and trading was still brisk. The Hong Kong dollar rate also loosened suddenly due to the aggressive selling by foreign banks.</p>
<p>Market Conditions Still Showed Oversupply</p>
<p>In the early morning, the near-term London Big Bar rebounded by 0.25, and the forward rate also rebounded by 0.125. The silver price remained stable. London raw gold rose by half a penny. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and against Shanghai remained stable. The rate against French francs rose by 0.025. The US dollar rate against British pounds was stable, the rate against Shanghai rose by 0.1 yuan, and the rate against French francs rose by 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. At the bank opening, the spot selling rate for the British pound was 6 5/16 d 5625, and the US dollar rate was 12.75 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound rose by 0.03125, while the US dollar saw no change. After the opening, the Japanese bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, suddenly started selling, and foreign banks' appetite was sluggish, causing the market to weaken suddenly. The Japanese bank sold spot British pounds at 6 5/16 d 6875. At the same time, a foreign firm absorbed spot US dollars from a certain bank at 12.875 yuan. When the HSBC listed rates were announced, they remained unchanged. And when the silver equalization tax was announced, it was a slight 0.75%. At that time, the Japanese bank's selling interest grew stronger. Western merchant house Sassoon also resumed selling. Moreover, foreign firms and Chinese merchant speculators also oversupplied, causing the market to weaken further. The Japanese bank, Sassoon, and foreign and Chinese merchants all competed to sell spot British pounds to foreign banks such as HSBC, from 6 5/16 d 6875, weakening to 8125. They also sold spot US dollars to US banks, from 12.875 yuan, weakening to 13.125 yuan. At this time, foreign banks were also willing to supply at the above prices, but the absorption price for US dollars even exceeded 13.25 yuan. Near noon, the foreign bank, Banque de l'Indochine, aggressively sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms, weakening to 45 yuan. At this time, the selling pressure for British and US currencies subsided slightly, and they slightly tightened. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling rate for the British pound was 6 5/16 d 6875, and the US dollar rate was 13 yuan.</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, Sassoon Suddenly Started Buying</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Western merchant house Sassoon stopped selling and started buying, and foreign firms also came to buy. However, foreign banks' selling interest was still good, causing the market to weaken instead. Foreign banks and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger sold spot British pounds to Sassoon at 6 5/16 d 6875 and 75. Subsequently, a US bank also sold spot US dollars to Sassoon at 13.0625 yuan. At this time, the US dollar rate was quoted as high as 13.1875 yuan, but it soon tightened. Afterwards, Banque de l'Indochine successively sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms at 45 yuan, which was relatively stable. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling rate for the British pound was 6 5/16 d 6875, and the US dollar rate was 13.0625 yuan. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, the British pound weakened by 0.15625, and the US dollar strengthened by 0.03125. The Hong Kong dollar, calculated based on the transaction price, also depreciated by 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Plunges Eight Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 23rd dispatch: The market opened quietly this morning. The market price was unchanged from yesterday's close. At 10:00 a.m. sharp, the Shanghai exchange rate plunged eight yuan, to 217 yuan. At 11:05 a.m., the British and US exchange rates softened. The British spot exchange rate rose by 0.03125, to 1s 2 8125/256d. The US spot exchange rate rose by 0.0625, to 28.875 yuan. The forward rates remained at the original levels. The Shanghai exchange rate rebounded five yuan, to 222 yuan. There were no changes at the noon closing. The market opened at 2:30 p.m., and the British, US, and Japanese exchange rates were stable. The Shanghai exchange rate fell again by two yuan, to 220 yuan. At 3:05 p.m., it continued to fall by two yuan, to 218 yuan. The US forward exchange rate also rose by 0.0625, to 28.8125 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate softened slightly by 0.0025, to 105.75 yuan. The market turned firm at the closing, and the exchange rate fell again by one yuan, to 217 yuan. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Foreign Currencies Continue to Fall; Japanese Gold Notes Fall to 9.55 Cents <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar remained unchanged. In this port, foreign firms still had a strong demand for foreign exchange. Japanese banks and speculators had stopped buying and were selling, causing the market to be very soft. The British pound was trading at 6 5/16 d 8125, and the US dollar was trading at 13.125 yuan. The market price fluctuations were quite sharp. The British pound closed at 6 5/16 d 6875, and the US dollar closed at 13.0625 yuan. Bullion opened at 2,570 yuan. Due to restrictions on deposits and withdrawals by silver and money firms, trading was greatly diminished, and the market price fluctuations were very narrow. The noon closing price was 2,560 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose first and then fell, and the evening closing price was 62 yuan, a sharp drop of 107 yuan compared to Tuesday. Due to the weakening of foreign exchange and the drop in bullion, foreign currencies all fell. The demand for British and US gold pounds was very scarce, and the decline was quite significant. Trading in British and US gold notes was not brisk, and the market price decline was also sharp. There was little demand for Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, Dutch guilder notes, etc., and the market was weak. Japanese gold notes lacked buyers, and the market price plummeted, with the evening market at 9.55 cents. Korean notes were at 8.6 cents. There was very little trading at the association. Houji sold 300 yuan of US gold notes to Taijin, and Changtai sold 200 yuan of US gold notes to Taijin. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 0.08 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.01 yuan, US gold pounds fell by 0.15 yuan, US gold notes fell by 0.024 yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by 0.006 yuan, French franc notes fell by 0.0004 yuan, Singapore Dutch notes and rupees each fell by 0.005 yuan, Annam notes fell by 0.002 yuan, Canadian notes fell by 0.03 yuan, Philippine notes fell by 0.015 yuan, and Australian gold notes fell by 0.01 yuan. Only Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes did not change.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Discounting Now Has a Formal Market Rate; From 135 Yuan, it Leveled Out to 100 Yuan at Closing <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discounting rate for exchange drafts decreased because, after the silver and money firms agreed on seven payment methods, people were no longer as fearful as they were the day before, and the demand for cash had decreased. The discounting rate had also developed a formal market rate. It was heard that the initial discount was 135 yuan per thousand yuan, but by noon it had gradually retreated to around 100 yuan. The afternoon rate was still 100 yuan, a decline of 60 yuan compared to the unofficial rate of the previous day. Compared to before the summer holidays (20th), it was 30 yuan higher. The interbank lending rate of the money industry association remained stable, suspended at the original price of 0.25 yuan.</p>

<p>London, 22nd dispatch: In the silver market, China sold a small amount, while India and speculators bought, resulting in limited trading. The market was stable. After the closing, it remained stable. India bought at the listed price, but sellers held back. The near-term big bar rose by 0.25, and the forward rate also rose by 0.125. From New York: The US spot price remained stable. From Bombay: The Indian silver market stabilized. Both the spot and futures prices rebounded by five annas.</p>
<h3 id="e52">From the Tongzhi-Guangxu Period to the Republican Era, the 21 Yuan Rice Price Ceiling, While Nominally the Same as in the 19th Year, Actually Set a Record <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The price of Shanghai japonica rice during the Tongzhi-Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty was around three yuan per shi. Between the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, although the rice price was more than double that of before, it was still only seven yuan and some odd change. Rice prices of four or five yuan were often seen. Once the Republican era began, the situation changed greatly. The highest summer rice price was above nine yuan, but there was no price of ten yuan per shi. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], as a result of Japanese transportation, the rice price rose to twelve yuan, which led to the annual average rice price remaining around eleven yuan after the eleventh year [1922]. From the fourteenth year [1925] onward, the rice price was even more expensive. In that year, the highest price was eighteen yuan, and the annual average was fifteen yuan and seventy jiao. Afterwards, although the rice price sometimes fell slightly, it was mostly high. In the eighteenth year [1929], the Jiangzhe region suffered a plague of rice stem borers. In the summer of the nineteenth year [1930], the high price of twenty-three yuan per shi was seen, and the price ceiling also rose to twenty-one yuan. The autumn harvest in that year was quite abundant, and the rice price leveled off. Until after the August 13th Shanghai Battle, due to panic, the rice price once rose sharply. However, that was a wartime price and cannot be taken as an example. As foreign rice was supplied and the war shifted westward, the rice price gradually returned to normal. Until the late spring and early summer of this year [1937], rice merchants manipulated the market and hoarders speculated, manipulating the rice price to above twenty-one yuan and fifty jiao. Yesterday (June 23rd), the two municipal councils set the price ceiling at twenty-one yuan (17 yuan for indica rice). Although this price is the same as the price ceiling in the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930], it is actually higher. This is because the current market is calculated in shi, which is 85% of the old Shanghai shi. Therefore, the price ceiling of twenty-one yuan, converted to the old shi, is about twenty-four yuan per shi, which is the highest rice price since the use of silver dollars. According to this year's rice price trend, and only setting a price ceiling after the rice price exceeded twenty-one yuan, this year's rice merchants can all be wealthy, but the stomachs of the masses are small.

<h3 id="e53">Piece Goods: Procedures for Delivering Payment for Goods; Chinese Factories Have Changed Methods; Change to Payment by Remittance at 10% Above Cash; Japanese Merchants Still Insist on Payment in Cash; Dyeing and Weaving Factories Face Difficulties <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Cotton cloth, plain and patterned, only has small transactions on this street. Most of the quoted prices for payment by remittance remain the same. Cash prices are slightly lower than before the festival. Various client groups on this street were originally scheduled to pay for bleached and dyed cloth and grey cloth due on remitted prices. The producing factories are separately urging payment and clearing of accounts. For the 70% remittance and 30% cash goods originally sold by Chinese Shenxin and other factories, the method was changed yesterday to convert the 30% cash to payment by remittance at a 10% increase, i.e., calculated at a discount rate of 100 yuan. Many other companies followed suit, which was quite convenient. Both buyers and sellers of new transactions lack interest. However, Japanese merchants still insist on cash payment, and delivery has stopped. Warehouse receipts have been sorted out. All those with clear procedures can pick up goods as usual. Client groups are mainly shipping goods from Guangdong province's Mazhang and other places to various provinces by mail package.</p>
<p>Eastern Fixed</p>
<p>The plain goods market is still closed. There are no formal market prices for fine cloth and fine twill. However, the warehouse receipt goods that were refused payment the day before yesterday have already been organized and delivered separately yesterday. As for the talk of changing to selling by remittance, there is no way to discuss it. There are many difficulties in new trading. The situation is deadlocked and cannot be opened up for a while. As a result, the dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai, which are springing up everywhere, usually use Japanese piece goods for printing and dyeing, add their own brands, and sell them as domestic goods in the market, selling well in the southwest domestic goods stores. 70% to 80% of the cloth sold in the city is Japanese goods. If you ask about the brand, they are all Chinese merchants. In fact, the so-called dyeing and weaving factories are all "dyeing" but "not weaving." Now, restrictions on cash deposits and withdrawals have been imposed, causing these loyal customers of Japanese factories - the dyeing and weaving factories - to force them to still pay in cash, because their factory owners do not care about their previous sales efforts, making it impossible to do business, and they are frowning and not far from decline.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 24th, piece goods exports: 75 pieces to Yantai, 5 pieces to Xiamen, 40 pieces to Hong Kong, 35 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 46 pieces to Beihai.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Talking About Summer Western Clothing Materials <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>The woolen industry is usually a silent season in the summer of each year because, at this time, except for a small number of white bombazine and white Zhigong, there are very few woolen fabrics that can be adapted to hot weather wear. Woolen fabrics are suitable for spring, autumn, and winter. However, there are still transactions in woolen shops, but most of them are not pure woolen fabrics. There are thick skins, yarn Zhigong, double-yarn woolen fabrics, etc. mixed with cotton (yarn), and some linen (linen) fabrics. Indeed, linen cloth has also produced many styles in recent years, with crepe ground, small grids, color dots, and herringbone patterns (Harmgbon). The average prices are between three, four, and five yuan.</p>
<p>The world is progressing, and naturally, everything in society is also being improved, invented, and progressed. As for the summer woolen fabrics, there are indeed many types that are popular in Shanghai. As far as I have come into contact with, there are Palitos wool, Fanerding (which has been on the market for a short history), light gray and coarse rice-colored Zhigong, and the most characteristic is a kind called "mesh wool."</p>
<p>There are many different types of Palitos wool on the market, and the quality is also very high. Years ago, Japanese goods were extremely active, and the value was also the lowest, only four or five yuan per yard. Therefore, for a time, even Palitos long gowns were extremely popular. Since the Shanghai War broke out, Japan has been short of raw materials, so Japanese goods have shown a slight "ebb" and the price is no longer as cheap as before. Following this, it is gratifying that domestic Palitos wool is also active, with prices between six and seven yuan. In addition, there are also products from Shanghai Yihua Factory, but the highest quality and price are "British imports," with values generally around ten yuan. There are many shades of colors such as rice, yellow, and gray.</p>
<p>Fanerding is also completely woollen (All wool). There are many colors such as rice, gray, white, brown, green, etc. In addition to British goods, there are also other countries' parallel imports on the market. However, due to the quality of the wool, British goods are the finest and cleanest, priced between seven and eight yuan. Last year and this year, it has been selling extremely well. This year, colors such as rice, brown, gray, and solid colors are particularly popular, and almost all are out of stock.</p>
<p>Coarse rice and light gray Zhigong are probably not common on the market because their wool quality is good and the value is high, making them not as common as Palitos and Fanerding. The rice-colored ones have white "Made in England" words and a "lion playing ball" pattern printed on the edge of the fabric every three yards. This kind of Zhigong is called Concord Worsted in English and costs 23.5 yuan per yard (retail). The gray ones are cheaper and can be bought for 18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Mesh wool should be the most expensive type of summer woolen fabric. It is woven from cashmere wool. It is incredibly soft and smooth to the touch. The fabric has countless small holes, so it is called "mesh wool." Although it is worn on the body, the small holes allow air to pass through, making it cooler than any other woolen fabric in summer. It costs 27 yuan per yard, and a suit, including tailoring, often costs more than 100 yuan. Therefore, those who can wear this kind of "mesh wool" are always wealthy young masters, bosses, and spendthrifts, which is not something that ordinary people can afford.</p>

<p>Customs Guaranteed External Debt Also Slightly Down</p>
<p>Yesterday, the domestic debt market was transacted in the public hall during the market, and Qiahe shares were still the most active stock, with a total of 23,100 shares traded. The initial price fell to 18.2 yuan. This price only rose to 18.7 yuan at the close after large buyers completed their buying. In the previous market, it was not decided how to deal with the restrictions on withdrawals from Chinese banks, resulting in sluggish trading. In the subsequent market, sentiment improved, and the buying prices of most industrial stocks also increased. The rubber stock market also showed a slight recovery. There were several stocks that were traded at the current low price.</p>
<p>The listed prices of Far East companies' stocks in London on the 22nd of this month (Thursday) fell across the board due to the Shanghai market changes. Shanghai Electric Tramway shares fell by two shillings and six pence, to 22 shillings and six pence. Baohan Insurance shares fell by three pounds, twelve shillings, and six pence, to 26 pounds and one shilling and six pence. Mecca Lee Bank shares fell by two shillings and six pence, to seven pounds. HSBC Bank shares each fell by one pound, with British registered shares at 77 pounds and Hong Kong registered shares at 80 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine shares fell by six pence, to 18 shillings. Fook Company shares fell by three pence, to one shilling and nine pence. Gulag Klim Pang Rubber shares fell by seven and a half pence, to 18 shillings and one and a half pence. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>The listed prices of Chinese external debts in London on the 22nd of this month (Thursday) showed a continued decline of one pound for customs guaranteed government bonds. The British-German Continued Loan (British issue) was priced at 52 pounds, and the Rehabilitation Loan (British issue) was priced at 37 pounds. The rest remained stable, with no changes. Physical goods were offered for sale in London, including 2,000 pounds of the German issue Rehabilitation Loan (with stamps), with a selling price of 30 pounds, a drop of seven pounds from the British issue listed price.</p>

<p>The seventh lottery draw of the 24th year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds was held in Chongqing on the 16th of this month. A total of six numbers were drawn: "01," "13," "136," "49," "641," and "184." The principal to be repaid was 4.2 million yuan in national currency, and the interest payable, together with the eighth-period interest coupons, was 1,512,000 yuan in national currency. Both are scheduled to be paid by the Central Bank of Chongqing starting on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Yarn and Cotton: No Trading in Spot Yarn; Yarn Shipped to Shantou Returned to Warehouse <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Although some people in the spot yarn market gathered as usual yesterday, most of them were just talking, because they could not raise enough cash and it was difficult to turn around. Business can only be conducted after a concrete solution is in place. According to news from clients, due to the Japanese army landing in Shantou and fierce fighting there, some of the yarn shipped to that place by the Fujian merchants has been returned, including 450-500 bales of 20-count cotton yarn, which are now stored in the yarn and cloth warehouse. As for Japanese yarn, since the new financial stability measures, there is a lack of legal tender, and the buying and selling of this yarn is all done in cash, making trading even more difficult. It is said that future transactions will require Japanese merchants to change to full remittance payments.</p>
<p>Today's cotton yarn exports include: 20 pieces to Xiamen, 100 pieces to Hong Kong, 105 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 235 pieces to Beihai, and 470 pieces to Haiphong. In addition, nine pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e58">After Relief Bill Passes, US Cotton Rises More Than Ten Pounds <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>New York cotton prices were very firm yesterday. The market opened lively, and traders were buying enthusiastically. This was because Washington announced that the long-debated agricultural relief bill was officially passed by a vote of 180 to 175. The government will allocate 215 million yuan, and at the same time, allocate 11.3 million gold yuan by a vote of 145 to 100 specifically for the promotion and transportation of surplus cotton. It is believed that 35 million yuan will be used for cotton export subsidies. (According to reporters' observations, if calculated based on the average of 7 million bales exported in previous years, each pound of US cotton could receive a subsidy of 0.01 yuan.) As a result, New York rose by more than ten pounds yesterday. India fell by one rupee, and Egypt fell by twenty pounds.</p>
<p>The outside market in Shanghai has been in chaos since the government restricted the free withdrawal of deposits. Due to payment issues, disputes have arisen on all sides. Recently, more and more foreign cotton has been arriving by ship. In order to calculate lower prices, foreign firms are calculating exchange rates based on the arrival date of the ship. With this sudden change in finance, manufacturers cannot pay on time, and foreign firms are suffering significant losses. It is hoped that this serious problem can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Trading in spot cotton, both Chinese and foreign, remains suspended. Not a single bale has been traded in any factory, completely falling into a state of stagnation. However, 760 bales of cotton from Tongzhou in northern Jiangsu arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Grain: Trading in the Rice Market is Very Quiet on the First Day of Price Controls <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Still Affected by Restrictions on Cash Payments</p>
<p>Since last week, rice merchants claimed that the supply of japonica rice had been affected, and the price rose all the way, reaching 22 yuan. The bourgeoisie did not care, but the general public's living standards could no longer cope. After the rice market was closed for two days for the Dragon Boat Festival, the authorities in the concession seemed unwilling to let it continue. From yesterday, price controls were implemented, with a ceiling of 21 yuan for high-quality japonica rice and 17 yuan for white indica rice, and no exceeding of these prices was allowed. Goods traded before the 20th will still be settled at the original price, and those with incomplete procedures should register immediately and be reported to the two municipal councils by the Rice Industry Association. Therefore, when the market opened yesterday, personnel from the political departments of the two municipal councils came to the market to inspect. Trading in the market was extremely sparse. Due to the extremely hot weather, sellers were afraid that the quality of the rice would change and wanted to sell. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance was preventing capital flight and stabilizing finance by restricting cash payments. As a result, only three batches of japonica rice were traded, totaling two to three hundred bales, and the price was difficult to maintain, falling within the price ceiling of 21 yuan. It is estimated that Chinese warehouse japonica rice was 20.082 yuan, Hengxing japonica rice was 21 yuan, and Maotai warehouse japonica rice was 20.5 yuan. Based on this rice situation, there seems to be a downward trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for indica rice was almost invisibly stagnant. Only two to three hundred bales were traded throughout the day. Because of the cash problem, companies and hoarders were not interested, and most stores on this street were also waiting and seeing. However, the selling price uniformly complied with the concession authorities' price ceiling of 17 yuan. High-quality Wuxi indica and Dashi Beijing indica were originally close to the price ceiling, but specially high-quality Nanjing indica was still a few jiao off.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Ten Thousand Bags of Flour Shipped to Korea, Local Sales Quite Slow <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market's condition, though open as usual, saw unusually sluggish transactions, mainly due to a shortage of cash. Customers were hesitant, unable to make further deals. Local transactions were also scarce due to the lack of cash. Millers continued to hold firm at four yuan, six jiao, and five fen in cash, refusing any bank drafts. Consequently, only a hundred or two bags were traded in small batches locally. The market's future recovery seems difficult in the short term. As for miscellaneous grains and wheat, there was no regular market.</p>
<p>Today, ten thousand bags of flour were loaded onto the British ship "Xinjiang" bound for Rashin in Korea. Shipping flour from this city to Korea is unprecedented, or perhaps it was previously done via Japanese ships, which is unknown. However, this is definitely the first time being shipped by a British vessel. According to those familiar with shipping, it is likely because Japanese ships are all used for military purposes, leaving no ships available for loading, hence the switch to a British ship. Additionally, today one thousand bags were shipped to Weihaiwei, and another five hundred bags to Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cakes: No Proper Method for Trading <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Trading in the oilseed cake and miscellaneous grains market largely relies on cash transactions. Supply outlets from all regions also depend entirely on cash for transportation and sales. Therefore, since the 22nd, when Chinese merchants and banks followed the "Ma Telegram" and restricted cash withdrawals for depositors, all sources and destinations have been completely obstructed. Currently, the guild has few good solutions for disputes arising from transactions before the 12th (because sellers are urging for payment and delivery, but buyers lack sufficient cash to pay). Moreover, in this environment of high prices, new transactions are indeed difficult. Yesterday's market still saw only scattered transactions. Besides new broad beans, which are reaching their peak sales season and saw a rise of one or two jiao compared to before the Dragon Boat Festival (details in the market price section), other commodities saw declines. Yellow beans fell by five fen to one jiao, and soybean cake prices have fallen below the three-yuan mark, with Dalian Yuanji cake at two yuan, nine jiao, and eight fen, and miscellaneous brands plunging from three yuan and one fen to two yuan, nine jiao, and six fen. Yesterday, 1,400 bags of imported cottonseed and 280 pieces of hide oil arrived from Ningbo, along with 11,720 pieces of soybean cake, 789 pieces of soybean oil, and 369 pieces of crude oil, all shipped from Qingdao. Today's exports included 100 bags of wheat bran and 825 bags of beans bound for Xiamen, and another 280 bags bound for Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Markets Weak, Silk Sales Unlikely to Expand <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Overseas silk markets, both in Japan and America, are trending downward. Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices fell another 20 yuan, with the afternoon closing still in the lower range. Futures fell by 27 yuan. New York prices also lacked activity, with nearby contracts down by a small two and a half fen, and futures down by half a fen. Spot Japanese silk prices fell by one fen each, while Chinese silk prices fell by two fen each.</p>
<p>The local silk market is still waiting for a turnaround in the export of white filature silk. Currently, foreign firms are not offering high prices, and there is no prospect of cocoons from inland areas arriving in Shanghai, making it difficult for silk sales to expand. White "Tu Silk" and printed silk saw thirty dan traded yesterday. New goods also arrived in small quantities, making the market more active. Today, ten pieces of silk are being shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Eastern Zhejiang Dry Cocoons Arrive Safely in Shanghai; Western Zhejiang Dry Cocoons Still Under Threat of Coercion <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The transportation of cocoons from Zhejiang province remains at an impasse. It is now known that a certain party insists on forcibly purchasing half of the cocoons, with half of the payment in arrears and the other half in "Huaxing" currency. At the same time, they are attempting to entice cocoon merchants to gather dry cocoons from guerrilla areas and move them towards transportation lines or areas under their control. It seems all conditions are subject to negotiation after the cocoons are en route. This clearly reveals the other party's ambition to seize everything. As long as bargaining is underway, the other party still has some leverage because they do not yet control all the cocoons. Once the cocoons reach the transportation lines, they will take whatever they want at their discretion, no longer needing to maintain this facade and haggle over the issues of "donations" and "taxes." It is hoped that the silk industry will not be fooled by this because once they compromise, they will lose everything.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new cocoons from eastern Zhejiang have safely arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, dry cocoons north of the Qiantang River can be transported via detour. Regarding the export of local products from eastern Zhejiang, it is necessary to settle foreign exchange as usual, but since the price of eastern Zhejiang cocoons is not high, the estimated value is probably not very large. Therefore, the losses in exchange rates can be compensated for through this method. Moreover, settling foreign exchange is a beneficial act for the nation and its people. (Xiang)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local tea market at foreign firms saw strong and smooth transactions. A total of 652 boxes of various grades, including "Chouxin Zhenmei," were sold by Yongxing, Renji, Jinlong, Tianyu, Xiehe, Yih and, and Baolong firms. The highest price for "Chouxin" was 320 yuan to 260 yuan. Ordinary "Zhenmei" traded in large quantities from 250 yuan to 196 yuan. Also, Baolong imported 39 pieces of "Saitianxiang Zhenmei," selling for 61 yuan. The market remained firm and showed no signs of weakening.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday fourteen pieces of tea leaves arrived from Ningbo. Today (the 24th), eight pieces are being shipped to Guangzhou Bay.</p>

<p>After a long period of silence, the black steel billet market, previously burdened by an excessive influx of goods and sluggish sales in all directions, leading to a soft market, has shown signs of activity since yesterday. Tianjin merchants took the initiative, and inquiries also came from Yantai, Qingdao, and other regions. Furthermore, local thermos bottle factories and printing iron factories also joined the search, causing a sudden shortage of spot goods on the market, and the standard prices surged temporarily. For example, 200-pound goods sold for 37 yuan per box, and 2,000-pound goods (calculated at 200 pounds) sold for 42 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Sugar Market: Dutch White Spot Prices Rise by Seven Jiao <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphs, the sugar market saw near-term August futures rise another two "bans" to 7 shillings and 4 "bans" 25, while far-term prices remained unchanged. According to Dutch telegrams, July-August futures were at 8.55 Dutch guilders, and September-October at 8.20. The local guild's bid for spot goods of 24 grade coarse white was stable, with our firm at 29 yuan and 2 jiao, trading 100 bags. Other firms and re-export goods were asking for original prices. Taikoo's "Che Bai B Mark" from the West Warehouse was at the original price of 28 yuan and 8 jiao, trading 500 bags at a small discount of two or three jiao. CW "Ka Dong" warehouse was at 28 yuan, 50 bags; the West warehouse at 28 yuan and 3 jiao; CX mark at 28 yuan; DY mark at the East warehouse at 27 yuan and 4 jiao; and HX mark at 27 yuan and 2 jiao. Dutch white spot prices were asking for a rise of seven jiao, at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, and re-export goods rose by half a yuan, to 14 yuan. Both domestic sugar firms were observing, with few transactions. Only inter-dealer trading saw some transactions. Although the prices were higher, they could not be considered a regular market. It is also rumored that foreign sugar dealers are proposing to switch to selling through bank drafts. Whether this will be realized remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Kailan bituminous coal, sourced from Qinhuangdao under the control of a certain party, is not affected by foreign exchange. However, local customers are stockpiling in anticipation of shortages, leading to strong buying interest. Sellers, considering their goods scarce and valuable, have raised prices accordingly, by two or three yuan per ton. The price for Kailan No. 1 lump coal is 44 yuan per ton, special fines are 40 yuan, and No. 2 fines are 30 yuan, ex-warehouse. Customer delivery incurs additional charges.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Jinhua Transportation Lines <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Before the war, Jinhua occupied a very important position on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Since the outbreak of the war, although it has been under considerable threat, it has always held the center of transportation. According to recent communications received from Jinhua, the transportation situation there is still very smooth, and is now described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Highways: The highways from Jinhua to various places are divided into four lines: Jinhua-Wenzhou, Jinhua-Ningbo, Jinhua-Anhui, and Jinhua-Quzhou. The Jinhua-Wenzhou line ends at Qingtian, with a total length of 195.5 kilometers, a one-day journey. You can have lunch in Lishui and stay overnight in Qingtian. The next day, take a small boat from Qingtian to Wenxi, and then switch to a wheel to reach Wenzhou. The ticket from Jinhua to Lishui is 5 yuan in national currency for the express train and 4.20 yuan for the slow train. The combined ticket from Lishui to Wenzhou is 3.50 yuan, including the boat from Lishui to Wenxi and the small wheel from Wenxi to Wenzhou. The Jinhua-Ningbo line ends at Xikou, with a total length of more than 255 kilometers, a one-and-a-half-day journey. Have lunch in Changle, stay overnight in Xinchang, and arrive at Xikou, where you can take a steamer to Ningbo. The fare from Jinhua to Changle is 5.42 yuan in national currency, Changle to Shengxian is 1 yuan, Shengxian to Xinchang is 1 yuan, Xinchang to Xikou is 2.10 yuan, and the steamer from Xikou to Ningbo is 2.30 yuan. The Jinhua-Anhui line ends at Weiping, with a total length of 146.58 kilometers, a one-and-a-half-day journey. You have to stay overnight in Lanxi and have lunch in Weiping the next day, and you can take the Anhui highway bus to Tunxi in the afternoon. The fare from Jinhua to Lanxi is 8 jiao, the fare from Lanxi to Weiping is 2 yuan and 5 fen, and the fare from Weiping to Tunxi is 4.10 yuan. The Jinhua-Quzhou line ends at Quzhou, with a length of only 99 kilometers, a three-and-a-half-hour drive, and a fare of 2.75 yuan in national currency. For each line, each person is only allowed to carry 20 kilograms of free luggage, and an additional freight of 4 li per kilometer is charged for every 10 kilograms (or less than 10 kilograms) exceeding this amount.</p>
<p>(2) Railway: Now the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway cannot be fully opened to traffic. If you board the train at Jinhua, you can reach Zhuji, Lanxi, Longyou, Qu County, Jiangshan, Yushan, Shangrao, Yiyang, Guixi, Yingtan, etc. The third-class fare of the express train is 1.80 yuan from Jinhua to Longyou, 2.25 yuan to Qu County, 3.25 yuan to Jiangshan, 4.30 yuan to Yushan, 5.35 yuan to Shangrao, 6.55 yuan to Yiyang, 7.15 yuan to Guixi, and 7.70 yuan to Yingtan. The ordinary train fare from Jinhua to Zhuji is 2.65 yuan, to Lanxi is 4.5 jiao, to Longyou is 1.25 yuan, to Qu County is 2.1 yuan, to Jiangshan is 2.95 yuan, to Yushan is 4 yuan, to Shangrao is 4.9 yuan, to Yiyang is 6.1 yuan, to Guixi is 6.7 yuan, and to Yingtan is 7.1 yuan. Second-class cars double the above prices, and first-class cars double the price. Third-class passengers are only allowed to carry 40 kilograms of luggage free of charge. For those exceeding this amount, a freight of 1 li per kilometer is charged for every 10 kilograms. Second-class passengers are allowed to carry 60 kilograms of free luggage, and first-class passengers are allowed to carry 80 kilograms.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Recent Situation of the Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation of the Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road, a brief record was published in the eleventh issue of this journal. Recently, a certain gentleman went from Kunming to Luzhou to conduct a personal investigation, and the information obtained about the road is quite detailed, so it will be described again below:</p>
<p>The Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road starts from Kunming, passes through Qujing and Xuanwei in Yunnan Province; Weining, Hezhang, and Bijie in Guizhou Province, Chishui River, and reaches Luzhou through Xuyong in Sichuan Province. The total length of the entire line is 912.70 kilometers. After crossing the Tuojiang River from Luzhou, there is a highway to Longchang in southern Sichuan, which connects to the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. This section has a total length of 62 kilometers and is also a section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway.</p>
<p>General Overview of the Entire Road Project</p>
<p>It can be divided into four sections, and the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) From Kunming to Xuanwei, a total of 258 kilometers, all road surfaces, bridges, and culverts have been completed early, the road surface is flat and solid, and heavy vehicles can drive. The Yunnan Provincial Highway Bureau has already been operating vehicles.</p>
<p>(2) From Xuanwei to Weining, a total of 179 kilometers. The road surface was only completed in early May of this year. The road surface has not yet started construction, and bridges and culverts are under construction. The mountain excavation project has not yet ended, there are many temporary roads, and vehicles cannot travel in rainy weather. In the current situation, heavy vehicles must never risk driving. Based on the progress of the project, the completion date of the road is estimated to be around the end of July.</p>
<p>(3) From Weining to the Chishui River, a total of 263 kilometers, the engineering aspects have been completed and vehicles can be driven.</p>
<p>(4) From Chishui River to Luzhou, a total of 210 kilometers, the road surface has been completed, but the mountain excavation project is in progress. During the construction period, driving is quite difficult, and some of the bridge markings have not been completed, and vehicles must pass through temporary bridges. The Southwest Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has set up an improvement engineering office and plans to start patrol work. Except for the bridge markings, other projects may be completed before the end of July. According to the current situation, heavy vehicles should not be driven.</p>
<p>Ferries:</p>
<p>If transportation vehicles start from Kunming and end at Luzhou, they must cross the river four times. If it stops at Lantianba, it only needs to cross the river three times. According to the current vehicles of various agencies and business firms, Lantianba is the terminal; therefore, in the future, transportation vehicles only need to cross the river three times, including the Qixingguan, Chishui River, and Yongning River.</p>
<p>Station Setting:</p>
<p>The Eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road, except for Luzhou to Longchang, Kunming to Luzhou, has a total length of more than 900 kilometers, and stations should be set up separately to facilitate management. In addition to Kunming and Luzhou as designated departure and arrival stations for the entire route, it is planned to set up eight stations along the way: Qujing, Xuanwei,  Jiaojiao, Weining, Hezhang, Bijie, Chishui River, and Xuyong. Among them, Xuanwei, Weining, Bijie, and Xuyong are lodging stations, and Qujing, Jiaojiao, Hezhang, and Chishui River are meal stations.</p>
<p>Itinerary and Mileage:</p>
<p>The itinerary of the road can be divided into five days. The first day is from Kunming to Xuanwei (258 kilometers), the second day is from Xuanwei to Weining (178 kilometers); the third day is from Weining to Bijie (175 kilometers); the fourth day is from Bijie to Xuyong (184 kilometers); the fifth day is from Xuyong to Luzhou (118 kilometers).</p>
<p>Transshipment.</p>
<p>There is currently no transshipment on this road. The Southwest Transportation Office and the Transshipment Management Office of the Ministry of Communications are planning to start.</p>
<p>Opening Time:</p>
<p>Except for the Kunming to Xuanwei and Chengdu to Chiyong River sections of the entire road, where the road surface bridges and culverts have been completed, there are many bridges that have not been completed between the Chishui River and Luxian, and mountain excavation projects are also under construction. Single lanes and temporary roads are encountered from time to time. As for the 179 kilometers between Xuanwei and Weining, the road surface has not yet started construction, and vehicles cannot travel in rainy weather. Observing the progress of the engineering aspects and the investigation of various county governments and engineering offices, the date when heavy vehicles can pass is at the end of July this year.</p>

<h3 id="e71">In the Midst of Transportation Difficulties, Efforts Should Be Made to Utilize Pack Animal Transport <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ye</p>
<p>Recently, I read a correspondence from Wuzhou in the newspaper. Recently, the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Qinlian Garrison Headquarters jointly formulated a transportation control plan to organize material joint transportation stations, and mobilize highway officials, dock workers, cart drivers, and porters from various places to jointly form groups to handle transportation matters. The control and management are presided over by the Political Department. At present, in the southern Guangdong area, from Beihai to Heng County in Guangxi, a material joint transportation station has been established first, and general stations have been established in Heng County and Beihai. From Heng County via Nanxiang, Lingshan, Wuli, and Hepu to Beihai, branch stations are set up in all major market towns. The management and joint transportation personnel of each general and branch station are filled by the original highway officials. Each station is equipped with dock workers, cart drivers, and porters, with a total of more than 3,000 coolies hired. Each joint transportation station can handle passenger and freight transportation at any time and send it to the destination station by station. The purpose of launching this material joint transportation is: First, to engage in wartime transportation so that the transportation of all goods is not affected by the war, and does not stagnate due to highway destruction. The second is to maintain rear transportation and solve the lives of unemployed employees. The third is to prevent smugglers from smuggling goods in and out and deceiving government tax revenue.</p>
<p>Looking at the above news, the purpose of the organization of this kind of material joint transportation in Guangxi Province is indeed worthy of our admiration, and the two points of dredging the freight and solving the lives of unemployed employees should be the top priorities, arousing our deep attention. I remember a few months ago, there were fragments of conversations with tourists who had returned to Shanghai from Chongqing and Yunnan, including that although transportation between Yunnan and Chongqing was smooth and unimpeded, and travel was convenient, the lack of vehicles made freight very difficult. Goods shipped from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to the mainland for sale are piled up in Kunming, Guiyang, and other places, as high as mountains, and it is quite difficult to dredge them for a while. However, there is already a highway from Kunming to Xufu in Sichuan. In order to save gasoline, the authorities used horse-drawn carts to transport goods, and the horses were escorted by a small team of soldiers, with 30 kilometers as a post station, and it was expected to take 12 days to reach the destination. It is being tried out and the results are good. In the past, there was also pack animal transportation, with each horse carrying 80 kilograms of goods, which was reliable, but the freight was also high, and it took 40 days to reach Kunxu. If goods are stockpiled and cannot be shipped, it is better to use this method than nothing, etc. According to the current goods transported to the mainland, they all take the route of Haiphong, via Kunming, Guiyang, to reach Chongqing. The lack of highway vehicles and freight difficulties are inevitable. Now, according to the horse-drawn carts and pack animal transportation mentioned in the conversation with the tourists returning to Shanghai, although the delivery time between Xukon is as long as 40 days, it cannot be said to be too long, but it is better than not being dredged at all, and the old pack animals were all privately operated, the organization was incomplete, and there was a shortage of manpower, and the results were less satisfactory. If the Chongqing and Yunnan authorities can pay attention to this, they can also learn from the Guangxi Provincial Material Joint Transportation Station and use this horse-drawn cart and pack animal transportation as transportation tools, improve their organization, promote a large number of porters, cart drivers, coolies and unemployed employees, and implement the solution of freight total mobilization through official-business cooperation. The 40-day journey may be reduced to 30 days, or even 20 days, and the number of 80-kilogram pack animals may be increased in each batch to dredge as much as possible.</p>
<p>This kind of method may seem too close to ideal at first glance, but if the person in charge can be based on the spirit of the Guangxi Provincial Material Joint Transportation Station and quickly improve this kind of pack animal transportation so that it becomes a beneficial tool for wartime transportation, not only can transportation be dredged, but a large number of unemployed employees can maintain their livelihoods because of it. Benefiting the people is often not shallow.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Travel Correspondence <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Feng Jiarui asks about the procedures and expenses for going to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Answer (1) You should prepare a passport and proof of identity before departure. If you entrust the China Travel Service to apply for a passport, the fee is 8 yuan in national currency. (2) The itinerary to Chongqing is to first go from Shanghai to Haiphong (37 yuan for the economy class, 10 days to reach)—Kunming (3 days by train, 22 yuan in national currency for the fourth class)—Guiyang (3 days by car, the fare is 33.10 yuan in national currency)—Chongqing (2 and a half days by car, the fare is 24.40 yuan). (3) Free luggage allowance, 30 kilograms by train, 16 yuan in Vietnamese currency per 100 kilograms exceeding the limit, 20 kilograms by car, 4 yuan in national currency per 5 kilograms exceeding the limit.</p>
<p>Zhang Tizhen asks about the situation of going to Lanzhou.</p>
<p>Answer (1) First go from Shanghai to Chongqing (please refer to the above for details). After arriving in Chongqing, take a highway bus to Chengdu, which takes two and a half days and costs 21.60 yuan. Take a bus from Chengdu to Baoji, and take a train from Baoji to Xi'an, which costs 38 yuan and takes 5 days. From Xi'an to Lanzhou along the Xilan Highway, it takes four and a half days and costs 26.35 yuan. (2) The China Travel Service now has travel checks for sale.</p>
<p>Liang Zhaoming asks about going to Ningming, Guangxi;</p>
<p>Answer (1) Those who go to Ningming, Guangxi, can take the route via Haiphong, Vietnam, passing through Hanoi, Liangxu, and Longzhou. For details, please refer to the "Shanghai to Guangxi" items in the previous and current issues of this journal. As for from Ningming to Chengdu, you can first go to Liuzhou, and then follow the Southwest Highway via Guiyang to Chongqing, the fare is more than 60 yuan, and the bus fare from Chongqing to Chengdu is 21.60 yuan in national currency. Those who take the above-mentioned route should prepare a passport and have it signed by the French consulate before they can pass.</p>
<p>Zhou Huaying asks about the route to Shangrao, Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Answer (1) Take the route via Wenzhou via Lishui to Jinhua, and then take a train from Jinhua to Shangrao. You should prepare a guarantor in Wenzhou before departure, otherwise the shipping company will not allow you to issue a ticket to Zhen.</p>
<p>Shang Boyuan asks about going to Deli, Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Answer (1) There is no other direct route from Shanghai to Deli Medan except for the North German Shipping Line. The company's ships only have first and second class cabins, and the second class ticket is 17 pounds per person. If you take an Italian or French mail ship from Shanghai to Singapore and then transfer, it will be slightly more economical. A landing deposit of 150 Dutch guilders must be paid. You should prepare a passport before departure and have it signed by the Dutch consulate before you are allowed to set off.</p>
<p>Xu Zhengji asks about the details of returning to Shanghai from Yunnan.</p>
<p>Answer (1) To return to Shanghai from Yunnan, first take a train from Yunnan to Haiphong, which usually takes three days to reach, 55 yuan in national currency for the third class, and 22 yuan for the fourth class.

<p>Japanese Warships Linger Along the Coast of Fujian Province</p>
<p>But No Unusual Movements, Garrison Maintains Close Surveillance</p>
<p>According to a telegram received from shipping circles, Japanese warships have been frequently traveling to and from the coast of Fujian Province recently. It was reported that five Japanese warships arrived and anchored outside the mouth of the Min River on the morning of the 22nd, launching motorboats for constant patrols. Local garrison troops are maintaining close surveillance, and coastal defenses are extremely solid and have not been relaxed at all. Shanghai-to-Fuzhou flights are operating as usual. The British merchant ship "Shenfu" was originally scheduled to depart on the 23rd, but due to insufficient cargo loading, it has been postponed to the 25th.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Attack Guerrillas, Unwilling to Break off Combat</p>
<p>At 5:00 AM yesterday, forty to fifty Japanese army soldiers, fully armed and carrying three machine guns, boarded the No. 3 "Municipal Government" paddle steamer at the South Pier of Pudong. They sailed to the garbage beach area at Xinlonghua South Head of South Huangpu and landed, attempting to attack the Wang Zonglin unit of the guerrillas. Initially, they lingered along the shore under the cover of warships for several hours, observing the situation before attempting to move south. At noon, they advanced westward for about three *li* (approx. 1 mile). The ambushing guerrillas responded instantly, unleashing a fierce barrage of machine-gun fire. Several Japanese soldiers fell, and the rest dropped to the ground to return fire. After an hour of engagement, as the guerrillas appeared and disappeared unpredictably, and their numbers grew with the battle, the Japanese troops, unwilling to continue fighting, retreated to the shore and returned to their original defense area on the same ship.</p>
<p>The Wind of Rising Prices Unabated, Cash Transactions Common, Copper Coins Scarce, the Cost of Living Ever Increasing, Relying on Cooperation from All Sectors to Stabilize Market Prices</p>
<p>Since the drastic shrinkage of foreign exchange, various industries in this city, to maintain their own capital, have successively raised their selling prices. However, even those unrelated to foreign exchange are taking the opportunity to raise prices. This situation is heard of every day. Whether it's clothing, food, or transportation, nothing is exempt. Those announcing price increases yesterday include: (1) Watson's soda water, (2) lace products from both Sande and Meixin, (3) Zhenhe paint, (4) Changyu wine, (5) Bo'an light bulbs, (6) electric machine silk, (7) toothbrushes, (8) Tianyiwei extract, (9) Shaoxing rice wine, and (10) paper products. Cash transactions are also required. Moreover, copper coins are extremely scarce on the market, so the cost of living for citizens is increasing, and everyone is complaining bitterly. However, because the national government's authority does not extend this far, it is hoped that all sectors will quickly devise sound strategies to suppress market prices and maintain the livelihood of the common people.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Enforce Rice Price Limits, Sending Personnel to the Rice Market for Supervision, Rice Merchants Violating Orders Given Severe Warnings</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rice prices, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have stipulated that, starting from the 23rd of this month (Friday), whether wholesale or retail, the highest market price for white *geng* rice shall not exceed 21 national currency dollars per *shi* (approx. 133 pounds), and the highest price for *ke xian* rice shall not exceed 17 national currency dollars per *shi*. Mid-range prices will be reduced accordingly. This has been announced by the Municipal Council. Yesterday (the 23rd), the Soy and Rice Trade Association market and various retail rice shops in the two concessions complied with the limits. The Municipal Council sent personnel to secretly investigate, and it was discovered that Qian Heng Yuji Rice Shop (located at 1174 Xinwen Road, i.e., the corner of Gordon Road) dared to outwardly comply but secretly violate the limits, selling privately at prices exceeding the limits. This was deemed highly inappropriate. The police immediately issued a warning, ordering them to reduce prices to the limit. According to the Municipal Council, if the shop continues to violate the regulations, it will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Transactions for Various Goods Must Be Registered Within a Deadline</p>
<p>Market Management Committee Public Announcement No. 70: According to the Market Management Committee yesterday (the 22nd), in a joint meeting with representatives of various trade guilds, the chairman reported that because market prices are too high, the two Municipal Councils, to ensure the people's livelihood, will implement price limits. For all goods traded by fellow merchants in this market before the 20th that have not yet been settled, a detailed list must be submitted to the North Market Office for registration before 5:00 PM today (the 23rd), so that it can be reported to the Municipal Council for explanation and to avoid accidents. If you do not report on time, this committee will not accept any disputes that arise. This is a special announcement, and it is hoped that fellow merchants will take note and not make a mistake.</p>
<p>Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Supervise On-Site</p>
<p>The Public Concession and the French Concession, to maintain the people's food supply and stabilize rice prices, have agreed with representatives of the various rice trade groups in this city that, starting today, whether wholesale or retail, the highest market price for white *geng* rice shall not exceed 21 dollars per *shi*, and the highest price for *ke xian* rice shall not exceed 17 dollars per *shi*. The Soy and Rice Trade Association has already made a public announcement in the market so that everyone is aware. Subsequently, the Municipal Council will dispatch personnel to the Qinglian Pavilion market every day to supervise the implementation. Those who exceed the price limits will be prosecuted. The appointed supervisors are Englishman Logan, Chinese Pan Lian, and Zhang Yingmei. All three are staff members of the Political Department of the Municipal Council Police Department. In addition, a western constable and two senior Chinese constables from the Laozha Police Station will maintain order in the market.</p>
<p>After the Market Opened, Transactions Almost Ceased</p>
<p>The Soy and Rice Trade Market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday. Market Management Committee members Fu Qian'geng, Wang Tianchou, Gu Yisheng, and Zhou Zhibai arrived at the market before it opened, informing the 105 firms in the market that all transactions should be conducted in accordance with the authorities' price limits, and should not exceed the price limits to avoid being prosecuted by the authorities. After the market opened, because of the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram (urgent telegram) restricting the deposit and withdrawal of funds, the rice trade, which previously relied on cash transactions, now faced a 500-dollar limit on previously traded goods, whether due or not yet due, resulting in check return disputes. As a result, market transactions almost came to a standstill. However, market prices did fall back to within the price limits.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Management Committee Meets to Discuss Measures</p>
<p>This *Xinsheng She* reporter learned from rice industry groups yesterday that, in addition to setting new price limits and rigorously enforcing the crackdown on speculation and manipulation, the authorities of the two concessions are quite concerned about maintaining the food supply for the concessions and facilitating the source of domestic rice. To prepare for potential problems, the Concession Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided to convene a Management Committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month (Tuesday), where the matter will be discussed. It is also heard that the concession authorities believe that, as the rice supply in Shanghai is still sufficient and the source of domestic rice has not been cut off, there is no need to order foreign rice at this time, as there is no fear of a food shortage in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Block the Northern Mouth of the Yangtze River; Britain Takes Active Measures, Adopting the Same Approach as the Swatow Incident; Japan Aims to Completely Exclude Britain</p>
<p>The *English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that merchants in this city believe that the Shanghai British authorities will respond to the Japanese navy's request that British ships and warships not sail the Yangtze River north of Chongming Island and below Qinglong Port (excluding the port itself) by answering in the same vein as in the reply to the Swatow warning and uphold the right of British ships and warships to sail in the inland rivers of China. It will also tell the Japanese authorities that Japan's warning does not relieve it of the responsibility of not obstructing British ships. The Japanese naval authorities have stated that if British ships are hit during Sino-Japanese military operations, Japan cannot be held responsible. According to sources in this city, Japan's plan to completely exclude Britain by sending new river steamers to sail the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been thwarted. The plan was made by the Nissin Kisen Kaisha, which intended to operate three 500-ton ships. However, due to the active guerrilla activity in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the launch has been postponed. It is heard that the guerrillas are currently engaging with Japanese troops at Songji Port, which controls the ports of the lower reaches. Although the British Consul-General in Shanghai has notified the Japanese Consul-General that he cannot accept its warning regarding Swatow, it is heard today that merchants in Swatow believe that Japan will attempt to block the port of Swatow, just as it has blocked the Pearl River. The response in Shanghai to this matter is that the British government will not lodge ineffective protests but will take active steps to curb Japan. This is probably the time.</p>

<p>Adjusting the Availability of Currency, Please Formulate Supplementary Measures, Silver and Money Industries Telegraph the Ministry of Finance Stating that Legitimate Needs Are Still Supplied as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's urgent telegram (Ma telegram) ordering the silver and money industries to restrict withdrawals of deposits is seen by all sectors as an effective measure to curb foreign exchange speculation. The silver and money industries, in addition to having discussed and determined seven implementation measures, yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, reporting on the implementation process. Regarding the current availability of legal tender in Shanghai, it is predicted that, after the implementation of this measure to restrict deposits and withdrawals, cash availability will inevitably become tighter. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will adjust the availability of currency at any time. If necessary, it is earnestly requested that the government allocate more cash to balance market needs. According to well-informed sources in the financial sector, the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram was in response to excessive withdrawals by some speculative merchants in this city last week and early this week to engage in speculation in the black market for foreign exchange. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance, at the request of various industries in Shanghai, will consider formulating supplementary measures to invigorate industry and commerce, or for the funds needed by factories to store raw materials, so as to provide convenience to legitimate industry and commerce while curbing speculation. According to banking sources, the clause "except for the payment of wages" in the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram restricting deposit withdrawals, all national funds originally deposited in national banks such as the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, etc., are also not subject to this restriction on withdrawals. The Ministry of Finance has also recently stipulated that, except for national needs and the payment of wages, the new measures should be implemented.</p>
<p>Legitimate Needs Hope for Remedy</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also received the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram on restricting deposit withdrawals yesterday and immediately notified all sectors to comply. It is heard that various sectors previously had measures to stabilize finances, stipulating that the number of weekly withdrawals was 5%, but the maximum amount was not to exceed 150 dollars per week, i.e., not more than 600 dollars per month. The new measures stipulate that the maximum weekly amount is 500 dollars, and the monthly amount is 2,000 dollars, which is broader than before and the difficulties are not as great as before. However, manufacturers, due to legitimate needs for purchasing raw materials, still hope that the Ministry of Finance will formulate supplementary measures to continue production and maintain the livelihood of laborers.</p>
<p>Market Situation Gradually Returns to Normal</p>
<p>Since the Silver and Money Industries Association agreed on seven important measures to deal with the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram, all banks and money shops have complied. Market rumors have ceased, people's hearts are at ease, and depositors withdrawing and depositing funds at banks and money shops have decreased. However, cash availability is extremely scarce, causing some difficulties for transactions in various industries, but this is a temporary phenomenon, and it will soon return to normal. Also, there have been many disputes regarding cash check withdrawals in the market. This is an inevitable phenomenon after restricting deposit withdrawals. For example, the discount rate for telegraphic transfers had no market on the previous day due to the chaotic market situation, but yesterday there was a formal market.</p>
<p>Requests for Funding to Be Approved</p>
<p>Regarding the payment of employee wages by various factories and firms, the Ministry of Finance's *ma* telegram is not subject to restrictions. Now the Silver and Money Industries Associations have decided that depositors paying wages, whose amounts are more than 500 dollars, may refer to the previous measures for stabilizing finances. According to this *Xinsheng She* reporter, all factories and firms paying wages must fill out an application form, which will be forwarded by the bank to the joint office of the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Development Bank for approval before payment. As for the application form, it can be obtained from the deposit bank.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange and Foreign Currency Transactions Decrease</p>
<p>(1) In the foreign exchange black market, foreign exchange had eased in the morning due to a lack of cash, and the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. Later, due to the entry of Japanese merchant banks, prices tended to tighten again. Yesterday, some large foreign banks and Japanese merchant banks dumped foreign exchange, causing prices to ease. (2) The discount rate for telegraphic transfers had no market on the previous day, but yesterday the discount rate for small money shops was 120 dollars per 1,000 dollars, but few transactions occurred. (3) Formal transactions began in the cash black market yesterday, but the transaction volume was very limited. The price was 2,570 dollars, slightly lower than the unofficial market on the previous day. (4) Due to a decrease in buyers, the price of foreign currency in the money exchange industry has fallen. (5) The securities black market has been suspended for two days starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Rams Norwegian Merchant Ship on the High Seas off Weihaiwei, "Kaizan Maru" Loses Course, Violently Collides with the Fourth Hatch of the HSBC Ship, All 60 Crew Members Miraculously Survive</p>
<p>The HSBC ship of the Norwegian company Lide Foreign Firm (Phams Co.) was chartered to Fuma Shipping Company at 31 Gongguan Ma Road, and recently re-chartered to British Fortune Shipping Company on Jiangxi Road, sailing the northern shipping route. On the 20th of this month, the ship loaded over 50,000 bags of flour, 3,000 cases of Chinese Soap Company soap, and over 200 tons of other miscellaneous goods, set sail from Shanghai, bound for Tianjin, intending to directly unload at Zizhu Forest.</p>
<p>Encounters Fog at Sea, Japanese Ship Violently Collides</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, around 10:00 PM on the 22nd, when the ship sailed to the sea off Weihaiwei, it suddenly encountered heavy fog. At that time, the Japanese ship "Kaizan Maru" (Kazan Maru) was also sailing in the area. Due to losing its course, for some unknown reason, it violently collided with the HSBC ship. The fourth hatch of the ship's forward water compartment was destroyed and severely damaged. After the accident, the captain, a Norwegian named Danielsen, immediately issued a distress signal. Another Japanese ship, "Kozni Muru," together with the "Kaizan Maru," jointly provided assistance and immediately sent a telegram to Weihaiwei, requesting tugboats for rescue, but received no response.</p>
<p>Ship Sinks, Crew Rescued</p>
<p>British Fortune Shipping Company received a telegram from the ship at 8:00 AM yesterday, reporting the details of the accident and stating that all 60 crew members had been rescued and boarded the Japanese ship, fortunately unharmed. After 10:00 PM that night, the ship's hull was still visible above the water. However, the company resent a telegram inquiring about the situation yesterday afternoon, but had not received a reply as of late last night. However, according to a radio telegram received by the radio station, the ship has completely sunk.</p>
<p>Ship and Cargo Losses Reach 1 Million Dollars</p>
<p>This *Daguang She* reporter learned from Fortune Shipping Company that the HSBC ship was built in 1927 and was only twelve years old. Its gross tonnage was 1,920 tons, and its construction cost was 15,000 British pounds, equivalent to 450,000 Chinese dollars. As for the cargo carried, such as 50,000 bags of flour, 3,000 cases of soap, and over 200 tons of miscellaneous goods, its total value was between 500,000 and 600,000 dollars. Therefore, if the ship has indeed sunk, the loss of the ship and cargo will be over 1 million dollars. However, it is understood that the hull and all cargo are insured by the shipowner and cargo owners respectively.</p>
<p>Outside-Boundary Roads Fire-Fighting Equipment: 15 Fire Hydrants Added to Baoli'nan Road and Other Locations</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council, based on suggestions that the number of fires in the area of the outside-boundary roads in the Western District is increasing daily, has approved the addition of 15 fire hydrants on the roads in the area. It is also reported that the cost can be greatly reduced by using the T-shaped water pipes on one side of the main water pipes installed on the roads. Therefore, the locations for installing the hydrants have been specially selected to connect with the T-shaped water pipes. The installation cost of the 15 hydrants will be approximately 400 dollars. Once installed, they can be used immediately, shortening the time required for firefighters to draw water for firefighting, and preventing a small fire from becoming a conflagration. The roads where the fire hydrants will be added are Baoli'nan Road, Kaixuan Road, Dunxin Road, Daxilu Road, Columbia Road, and Anhe Temple Road.</p>

<p>The wife of the German Chargé d'Affaires to China, Ambassador Fischer, held a grand bazaar in her official residence garden on the evening of the 17th of this month to raise funds for the Chinese Displaced Children's Shelter.

The remaining 300 dollars will be donated for the expenses of the Chinese Displaced Children currently receiving treatment at the Baolong Leprosarium.</p>
<p>"East Asia New Order," Japan's New Interpretation, Claims That It May Not Expel the Rights and Interests of Other Countries, Even Providing Protection or Increase</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that, at a reception for reporters held by the Japanese side yesterday (the 22nd), a reporter asked whether the "open door policy" would be maintained under the "East Asia New Order." A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy did not give a definitive answer but said that the "New Order" did not aim to expel foreign rights and interests from China but would protect and increase these rights and interests. Asked whether this meant respecting the treaties related to Nanjing, Tianjin, and extraterritoriality, the spokesman replied that the question expressed a completely different view of military operations. The "New Order" did not necessarily mean expelling the rights and interests of other countries from China. Every treaty needed to be investigated and discussed. The Japanese side did not intend to disregard treaty provisions. The spokesman also responded to a question about the blockade of Gulangyu, saying that the mainland was still in the hands of Chinese troops. The current measures were to prevent undesirable elements from infiltrating the Public Concession. A reporter then turned to the Tianjin issue, asking whether the United States was already involved. The spokesman replied that an answer could be found in Hull's recent remarks. Hull stated that the United States had no direct relationship with the extradition of the four suspects to the Japanese side, but other aspects of the case were related to the United States. The matter was triggered by the British authorities' refusal to hand over the four suspects. The British side then began to propagate the matter as if it were related to the rights and interests of all third countries in China. Asked when a peaceful attitude would be restored in Swatow and whether foreign ships would be allowed to enter the port, a spokesman for the Japanese Navy replied that the matter would be discussed at that time. Regarding discrimination against British personnel, the spokesman said that all foreigners were treated equally, but Japanese officials and people were well aware that the British government was assisting the Chinese government, so there might be discrimination against the British. The spokesman also said that the authorities of the two concessions had provided some cooperation in curbing anti-Japanese activities and that the Japanese Marines were also cooperating in the "Safety First Movement."</p>
<p>Five Provinces (Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong) Inland and Water Transportation</p>

The office has specially licensed a commercial motorcade of fifteen vehicles, organized by the commercial sector, which began operations on the 11th of this month. Its route starts in Zhejiang, passes through Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, and ends in Guangdong province. Therefore, passenger and freight transportation between the five provinces will become more convenient.</p>

Today is the last day of the promotion week, ending at 12:00 AM, but the authorities of the two concessions have stated that, although the Safety Week has ended, they will continue to make their utmost efforts to ensure that the spirit of this event remains permanent.</p>
<p>"Deping" and "Moufook" Ships to Ningbo Allowed to Carry a Small Number of Passengers, Limited to Those with Important Matters Certified with Guarantees; Rumors of 200 Passengers Are Absolutely Inaccurate</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of resuming passenger service on the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route, repeated requests had been made by all parties, but they have not been approved due to the restrictions. Recently, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, in response to the requests of a majority of its members, decided to send a telegram to General Chiang and Commander Gu, requesting permission to carry passengers to facilitate the return of fellow villagers. However, the telegram was sent only a few days ago and has not yet been approved. Yesterday, it was reported that the passenger issue had been resolved, with the "Deping" ship allowed to carry 200 passengers from Shanghai to Ningbo, and the "Moufook" ship also carrying a small number of passengers as an example. According to this *Daguang She* reporter's inquiries to the Sino-Italian Shipping Company yesterday, although requests have been made to the Ningbo authorities regarding the passenger issue, they have only agreed to allow passengers with necessary matters to travel to Ningbo, provided that they have accurate proof and reliable guarantees. The number of passengers is strictly limited, and the rumor of 200 passengers is not true. The "Deping" ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will now set sail for Ningbo at 4:00 AM this morning. According to news from the shipping department of the German Lihua Foreign Firm, the "Moufook" ship has the same passenger procedures as the "Deping" ship, but passengers are still strictly prohibited from traveling from Ningbo to Shanghai. The rumor of formally restoring passenger service has been firmly denied. The "Mourfook" ship arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and is scheduled to return directly to Ningbo at 4:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Statistics of Displaced People</p>

Interest payments for the savings department began on June 20th, and the commercial department is scheduled to begin closing on the 25th (tomorrow). Moreover, various industries in Shanghai have developed abnormally after the war, so the funds released by the banks have been recovered on schedule. It is expected that each bank will achieve considerable profits after the mid-year closing.</p>

<p>Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing Five Times: More Loss Than Gain, Japan Consumes 40 Million (Currency), China Losses 5 Million (Currency)</p>
<p>The *Millard's Review* reports that Japan's recent five air raids on Chongqing cost at least US$1 million each time, for a total consumption of US$5 million for the five raids. This is the opinion of foreign aviation experts, several of whom were in Chongqing during the air raids. The Japanese consumption figures are as follows: the average number of bombers participating in the raids was 27, and each time the Japanese lost four of them. Each bomber used by the Japanese costs approximately US$125,000. Losing four aircraft each time amounts to US$500,000. Each bomber carries seven airmen, four of whom operate machine guns. Training an airman in the United States costs approximately US$100,000. If training a Japanese airman costs only half that amount, the loss is still significant. Other items such as bombs and gasoline are also considerable. Each aircraft carries approximately 1,000 pounds of bombs, costing an average of US$1.50 per pound, which means that the bombs for each aircraft cost approximately US$1,500. Since the nearest air base is in Hankou, each aircraft flies for eight hours, requiring approximately 800 gallons of aviation gasoline. Shanghai's major companies sell aviation gasoline in bulk at approximately US$0.25 per gallon, so the gasoline for each aircraft costs approximately US$200, totaling approximately US$5,400 for the entire fleet. The property destroyed in Chongqing does not exceed 5 million National Currency dollars (fapi). Therefore, the cost of the five Japanese air raids, according to the current exchange rate, has reached as much as 40 million National Currency dollars (fapi).</p>

<h3 id="e74">Japanese Demand Foreigners Withdraw from Shantou: Britain and America Firmly Refuse; Japan Must Bear Full Responsibility; British and American Warships Stationed in Shantou Also Do Not Withdraw; Foreign Observers Express Satisfaction <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that U.S. Consul General Gauss and British Consul General Philip firmly rejected yesterday afternoon (the 22nd) the final ultimatum from the Japanese Navy demanding that all foreigners withdraw from Shantou by 1:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd), stating that after this time, the Japanese authorities would not be responsible for the lives and property of foreigners. Earlier, the U.S. Consul General received a telegram from Admiral Yarnell and immediately drafted a reply to the Japanese authorities. Admiral Yarnell set sail from Qinhuangdao on a warship and is currently en route to Qingdao.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Japanese Government Fully Responsible for the Lives and Properties of American Citizens <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The telegram instructed Gauss to immediately notify the Japanese authorities that the United States requires the Japanese forces in Shantou to bear full responsibility for the safety of the lives and properties of American citizens. The U.S. Consul General then sent a note to the local Japanese authorities, refusing their demand and reiterating the U.S. policy in the Far East, stating that the U.S. government authorizes U.S. warships to sail to any location where the lives and properties of American citizens are in danger and refusing the Japanese request for U.S. warships to withdraw from Shantou. Before Gauss received the telegram from Admiral Yarnell, he had already forwarded the Japanese ultimatum to Washington.</p>
<h3 id="e76">British Consul Takes the Same Stance, Rejecting the Japanese Request <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Shortly after noon yesterday, the British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, visited Gauss. After leaving the U.S. Consulate General, Philip drafted a note rejecting the Japanese ultimatum, following the same approach as the U.S. note. The note firmly stated that British citizens have the full right to reside in Shantou and British warships have the full right to anchor there, as Shantou is a treaty port. It also stated that the British authorities cannot accept the Japanese attitude of not taking responsibility for the lives and properties of British citizens in the area and that Britain requires Japan to bear full responsibility for the lives and properties of British citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Japanese Send Conflicting Messages <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that less than two hours after the Japanese troops landed in Shantou at 2:50 PM on Wednesday, they sent an ultimatum to the foreign consulates at 4:00 PM, demanding that all foreigners completely withdraw from Shantou by 1:00 PM yesterday. The Japanese authorities first notified the British warship "Sarnat" docked in Shantou and then sent the same telegram to the foreign consulates in Shanghai. Although the foreign consulates have confirmed receiving this message and have rejected it, the Japanese spokesman stated at a press conference in this city yesterday that he was unaware of the ultimatum and claimed that the statement that the Japanese authorities would not be responsible for the safety of foreigners and their property after 1:00 PM yesterday was "completely inaccurate."</p>
<h3 id="e78">British and American Authorities Cooperate; Foreigners Express Satisfaction <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>When asked why foreigners were asked to withdraw from the city, the spokesman stated that this was a routine step taken immediately after the Japanese launched military operations and that there were Chinese troops "north and south of Shantou," so there was still the possibility of fighting in the city. Foreign observers believe that the Japanese spokesman's statement that it was "completely inaccurate" and the fact that the foreign consulates had received the ultimatum are contradictory and that the Japanese diplomats in this city are trying to cover up the ultimatum issued by the Japanese naval command in Shantou. It was also learned last night that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, telegraphed the British authorities in Shantou yesterday morning, instructing them not to encourage the evacuation of British citizens unless serious dangers were considered. Foreign observers expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between the British and American authorities in this city in handling the Shantou ultimatum. It is said that this cooperation is sufficient to demonstrate the close cooperation between Washington and London in handling Far Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, according to a person who has just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, British people in Tianjin were not only searched and insulted by Japanese soldiers, but also robbed by them, resulting in not only mental trauma but also material losses. For example, a British person carrying 100 yuan in legal tender was robbed by Japanese soldiers, and the mechanism of his watch was removed from the case. Foreigners in Tianjin believe that this action by the Japanese soldiers was purely provocative. An Australian was also humiliated, stripped of his clothes, and even his socks and shoes were taken away. Then, he was pushed back into a line of two thousand pedestrians waiting on the street corner for five hours before it was his turn to be searched. However, the search was not yet over when the Japanese soldiers ordered him to return again the next day. Any foreign nationals from Germany, Italy, or America were allowed to pass, even without being searched, but not British nationals. However, the Australian had important business to discuss and decided to enter the British Concession. He consulted with a Japanese friend, who accompanied him to the entrance of Shansi Road on the border of the former German Concession and told the Japanese officer in charge that he was Australian. The officer thought he said "Austrian," and his passport only had "British Consulate" and not "Britain," so he was not noticed and was able to enter.</p>

<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, Mr. Steele, a reporter from the *Chicago Daily News* stationed in China, told reporters today (the 23rd) that he recently met with Gandhi in India, who is supported by millions of Indians, and discussed Chinese affairs for an hour and a half. Gandhi was deeply concerned about the Sino-Japanese War and deeply sympathized with China's struggle, as Gandhi hoped for universal peace and hated any kind of violence. Although some people oppose Gandhi's doctrine, Gandhi still holds significant power in India today. Although his appearance is calm, he lives in a noisy environment, and his keen mind is still active. It is reported that Mr. Steele traveled to India, Burma, and the southwestern provinces of China for half a year and has just returned to Shanghai. When he was in southwestern China, he traveled the entire length of the</p>
<p>Burma Road.</p>
<p>Mr. Steele called the road "one of the most amazing achievements of modern engineering," employing as many as 160,000 coolies during its construction. Mr. Steele met with Chairman Chiang in Chongqing and was deeply impressed by the Chairman's unwavering spirit. He also said that today, everywhere one sees the strength of Chairman Chiang, which is a clear sign of China's unity. Mr. Steele also commented on the Burma Railway, which is currently under construction, stating that the work on this project is currently</p>
<p>in progress</p>
<p>at a rate that is rarely seen. More than 100 miles of the roadbed have already been laid, and a portion of the line is expected to be open to traffic next winter. It can be completed in three or four years.</p>
