<p>四日之前，報載內地消息，各地奉令普遍建立抗戰陣亡將士紀念碑。昨載香港電訉，軍事委員會令，凡參加各地偽組織者，除實係被迫，願卽革面洗心，應許自新免懲外，倘有民族叛徒，尙自執迷不悟，或厕身傀儡，或潛作漢奸，應按懲治漢奸條例，嚴緝懲辦，以彰法紀云。此二事者，一以彰忠貞，一以儆奸邪，意義厥同。夫士氣民心之鬱勃，淵源有自也；在外侮侵陵之會，士氣民心輒以先天血統為基礎；益以平時敎育之啓迪，於是體認愈眞，發揚愈大；然求其普遍深入，而可以切實主宰一般心靈與行動者，尤必國家有獎懲之法令，社會有褒貶之制裁。蓋必如是，而後功罪榮辱之報應於斯人者，顯見忠貞與奸邪之辨，無可假借；是培養士氣民心之為效最速最宏，殆有十百倍於敎育者矣。</p>
<p>中國方在抗戰中途，國家政治與社會狀態，皆逈殊於平時而各有其非常時期之徵象；在後方與前綫以及游擊戰區，則又同時幾乎畫然為三天地焉。游擊戰區最多變態，最堪懷念。其間志士仁人節婦烈女以皎潔之心靈，沸騰之熱血，演為種種可歌可泣之事蹟者，不知凡幾。其次，捐介孤忠之匹夫匹婦，不得逃生，不得死所，閉戶索居，苟延殘喘，而惟听夕以求天日重光者，又不知其凡幾。若乃喪心病在，奴顏婢膝，倚勢凌人，作威作福，欺壓良懦，荼毒鄕里者，亦比此皆是，初不必掛名偽職也。莫為善者獎，亦莫能執惡者而懲之；不獎則無以勸善，不懲則無以儆惡；誠使中國及早收復失地，則亦已矣，不然，時日稍久，則掙扎求存於黑暗鄕中者，必至良懦歸於淘汰消滅，而競為虎狼。是以我人以為各地普建抗戰陣亡將士紀念碑而外，猶必就游擊戰區，以各種不同之形式與方法，激勸賢良，表揚忠烈；中央明令倡導於上，責成游擊戰區之政訓工作與行政人員切實奉行於下，而滯留於游擊戰區之明達之士，對於鄕里之賢良忠烈亦負有義不容辭之責任焉。</p>
<p>至於懲惡，應不惟傀儡與漢奸而已。懲治漢奸條例所列，固屬無可寬假；此外猶必針對游擊戰區之罪惡，約法數章，檄示內外。蓋淪陷於游擊戰區者，猶是中國人民，旣未可視如化外，即未可置之度外；能為防止一分罪惡。即可保存一分淸明之氣。且在變態之下，有為平時法律所不罪，而在此期間與境地，則其心可誅，其行為不可赦者。有為平時法律所容許所保障，而在此期間與境地，則輙為罪惡之媒介與憑藉者。中國政府若遙為厲禁，則雖目前為國力國法所不及，未可遽期以制止奸邪，然風聲所播，俾游擊戰區之人民，獲有是非黑白之新標準，洞明利害，知所從違。夫如是云云者，非以謀游擊戰區人民之安於淪陷也；要知彼等生活於水深火熱之中，半由不肖同胞之為爪牙鷹犬，狼狽為奸。若使中國政府針對罪惡，別訂專法，在遙禁之下，使是非黑白，昭然若揭；於是而得减少若干爪牙鷹犬，或减少若干奸邪之行為，則游擊戰區人民固得稍紆疾苦，而彼强佔斯土者，亦减少其剝削之機會，减少其綱羅之效用。是以即就目前言之，實為有益之措施。於是更推而之於戰後，則是非黑白之新標準所在，無論將來懲治之於正式法庭，或取决之於民衆裁判，或為法綱所不及而放任之於社會制裁，使荼毒同胞者，必食其報，是則不僅彰公道而已，亦建國之基礎所寄也。</p>

<h3 id="c37">上海敎育界　改革敎育意見　當前改進我國高等敎育的意見書（三）  蔭樓 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>或有人說大學院系合併後、大學校數量减少、質量提高、决非一般高中畢業舉生所可人其門牆、欲高等專門人才之增加、勢必更難、關於這一點、我認爲補救之道、一方面應取消高等敎育學額上的限止、他方面於大學或獨立學院中得增設各該特長系別之專修科、縮短其年限、放寬其學額、注意其實用、以適應社會的需要、</p>
<p>或有人說我這種主張是理想的、恐於事實上不能辦到、因爲一校有一校的歷史、一校有一校的背景、强合爲分固不可能、强分爲合談何容易、的確要學校由分而合、究不免發生許多困難、不過我們辦敎育者、苟以整個中華民國的敎育爲前題、須不應當冉堅持着自己的歷史、牢守着自己的門戶、尤其是在道非常時期、我中國敎育界更應通力合作、節省人力物力以爲國家致用、最近在南鄭有北平大學北平師大北洋學院合併組織的西北聯合大學、在昆明有北京淸華南開等大學合併組織的西南聯合大學、在上海有束吳滬江之江約翰等合併組織的華東基督敎聯合大學、（可惜還沒有達到院系合併的程度）、不是已各有相當的成效麼、我希望這種聯合性的大學能逐漸地推廣、而成爲永久的組織、</p>
<p>六·學校應合理分佈</p>
<p>就全國大學校與獨立學院的分佈言、則根據民國二十三年度敎育部的統計全國專科以上已立案之學校計、共有一百十一校（現已不祇此數）、而其中設在平津者有二十校、設在京滬者共計有三十校、是平津京滬兩處之大學巳佔全國大學的半數、較諸英法德意等任何一國大學的總數爲多、而同時內地各省中如貴州西康然河靑海西藏蒙古寗夏綏遠黑龍江等省尙未有一專科學校的設立、遑論正式的大學、一方大學過剩、一方大學缺少、高等敎育如此分佈、實屬大不合理、蓋大學學生於沿海幾省的都市集中訓練、其耳濡目染、習見習聞者、是汽車是馬路是電燈、是無綫電、是抽水馬桶、是影戲院、是跳舞塲、內地各省的民衆生活、衣襤褸、居茅棚、吃樹皮草根、目不識之無、鳩形鵠面的形態、他們那裏能見得到、至於內地各省的土壤氣候水利地質昆蟲植物和寶藏等、他們又那裏能澈底明白、這所以在通商大埠培植的人才、往往不能爲鄕村用、在蒙古新疆所培植的人才、也往往不能爲上海北平用、中國過去數十年高等敎育的成績、可以說是繁榮了沿海幾省的都市、而遺棄了枯寂將死的農村、我們試從上海而向西北行走、則儼然如走上了歷史的程綫、可以從二十世紀的現代、一直跑到上古的原始社會、這也可以說是敎育分佈不合理的結果、要糾正這種病態我希望敎育行政當局、値此非常時期、大學不能安於原址的時候、應從速提倡高等敎育的內移、於短時期中能依各省中學校的多少、而達到每省一大畢的最低標準、再斟酌各該地的特殊情形、而增設各種專門學校以發展其生產、領導其民衆、這樣方可以收地無遺利人無遺才的功效、最近德國政府移動、其一部份大學到Alsace　Lorraine的邊區、期遂其開拓邊疆的雄心、也可以見得高等敎育分佈地點的重要性、所以我們要開發西北、應速增設大學於西北、我們要保衛邊省、應速增設大學於邊省、不然千里沃野、每失之於不知不覺之中、這是誰的責任、這是我們敎育的責任、</p>
<p>我中華民國的敎育就過去的歷史來說、於一八六二年英法聯軍後有一次改革、一八九五年甲午之役後又有一次改革、一九〇一年庚子之役復再有一次改革、經一次國難、有一次革新、這三次的革新、於敎育史上不可謂非重要、不過仍是表面的變動、沒有發生重大的效果、我們看到全國的大中學生在過去的幾年中、雖是於數量上增加不少、惟於質量上依然沒有什麼顯殊的進步、尤其是關於那百分之八十的文盲、仍是占着世界各國的首位、也可以說是我們中國敎育界的恥辱、中國當前的政治和社會經過這樣嚴重的國難、必有劃時代的改進、極希望敎育當局能於過去痛下鋮貶、作澈底的改革、一方面於高等敎育之質量上力加改善、一方面於大衆的識字敎育衛生敎育生產敎育等努力推進、迎頭趕上、必使人人有飯吃個個都識字、二十世紀中國新敎育的使命、方告完成、上述幾點、不過就找個人對於當前高等教育的感想、約略陳述、是否有當、還祈全國敎育會議公决、（完）</p>

<p>據外人方面消息、駐滬日總領三浦、前日突通知英·美·意·法·挪·葡·等各國領署、謂日本海軍將在浙東海門採取軍事行動、希通知第三國船隻、限十七日晚駛離、各外商輪公司、均已接得各該頭署轉知、泊台之外輪、擬暫時避離、以觀動靜、旅滬浙人、態度極鎭定、探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>日領通告揚言攻台</p>
<p>英·美·意·德·挪·葡·等各國駐滬領署、前晚突接日領事三浦通知、謂駐泊浙東日海軍、卽將在台州灣及海門採取軍事行動、希望卽行轉告第三國商輪、儘於本月十七日（卽今日）晚六時以前駛離或停止開往海門、最低限度、須距離該處三十海里、否則如發生一切損害、日軍方面、將不予負責云云、各領署接得上項通知後、當卽轉告各該國航商、謂爲注意、</p>
<p>外商暫避藉觀動靜</p>
<p>現泊駐海門準備消度春節之輪隻、僅葡商正德公司之山泰輪一艘、茲爲暫時避免意外、以觀動靜起見、已由滬公司電該輪船主卽行駛滬、昨下午接覆電、該輪準於今晨離台來滬、又美商美利公司之美達輸、於昨晨由甌駛台、卽於當晚到達、定今晨卽行逕駛寗波、美商華美公司之棠貝輪、於前日到滬、原擬今日駛台度歲、現决暫時停開、寗紹公司承租之英商永陞輪、原定今日駛台、茲改直達駛甬、是吾再由甬轉台、須俟局勢如何决定、至尙有滬台錢哈納·海福·兩輪、則適在滬入塢歲修、</p>
<p>旅滬浙人態度鎭定</p>
<p>自前項消息傳出後、頗引起浙人之注意、但據一般推測、海門係浙東貧瘠之區、除出產若干橘類外、毫無其他物產、且在軍事上更無重要意義、現悉泊駐浙東洋面之日艦、僅第四號一艘、其力量亦殊談不到登陸、蓋在海門沿海一帶、我方均有餒密佈置、而該地自衛團及壯丁等、亦具相當抵抗力、日如進犯、必遭痛擊、日頒此决通告、或係含有恐嚇性質、卽或採取軍事行動、亦不過肆行騷擾而已、至寗波·溫州·兩處、則沿海要塞防範、允極鞏固、日方計劃、决難得逞、故旅滬浙人、態度極爲寗靜鎭定、對前項消息、並不十分重視、</p>

<p>日海陸軍爭奪沿江各口稅收、雙方意見、積不相容、近日愈演愈烈、竟於前晚（十四日）在小川沙發生衝突、情勢非常緊張、該鎭居民、均逃避一空、旋經日軍事當局設法處置後、始未擴大、惟海陸軍積怨甚深、遲早必將發生嚴重事變、茲經現代社記者探誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>衝突原因</p>
<p>小川沙係寳山縣管轄、位於吳淞瀏河之間、爲沿江要隘、離港口四五里許、有一小鎮、平日居民極少、「八一三」滬戰爆發、國軍堅持抵抗、兩越月後、因日軍在小川沙登陸、包抄大塲·羅店·等後路、國軍三面受敵、爲保持實力起見、即將閘北放棄、故小川沙自戰後以來、成商業交通區域、日方因該鎮係屬軍事據點、除駐守日陸軍數十名外、日艦復來往弋巡頻繁、在去年未駐兵前、商旅貨運、異常發達、各項稅收頗鉅、迨後駐防日軍、各項商貨、進出驟减、稅款收入有限、但日方仍視爲禁臠、該項稅收進益、槪歸駐防之陸軍及偽組織方面主持、而沿江海軍、則無法分肥、初對商旅來往、極盡各種留難手段、作間接方面之傾軋、但近日來日海陸軍雙方積怨愈深、竟至發生直接衝突、</p>
<p>全鎭紛擾</p>
<p>當日海陸軍於本月十四日晚發生衝突時、槍聲甚厲、岸上駐防日軍、情勢緊張、該鎭居民、疑爲演習或進攻遊擊隊、迨後海軍登岸擎槍向岸上日軍瞄準射放、始知日軍自相衝突、全鎮居民、恐慌萬分、紛粉從黑夜中逃避四鄉、到翌晨（十五日）天明時、槍聲停止、情形稍爲緩和、所有登岸之海軍、仍回兵艦、至中午十二時許、該日艦離沙、向吳淞方面駛去</p>
<p>日方制止</p>
<p>此次日海陸軍之衝突、日方當局保守秘密、頃據寳山嘉定等處來人先後談及此事之內幕、（係由偽組織方面透露）其衝突之根本原因、完全爲權利爭奪、當雙方演成特殊行動後、日方軍事當局得悉、卽設法竭力壓制、始未擴大、惟照目前各地日海陸軍情形而論、彼此啣恨異常、遲早將發生更嚴重之事變、</p>

<p>據關係方面探悉、漢陽兵工廠被日軍侵佔後、華軍未及移走之廠底笨重機件、均被陸續拆卸、派運輸艦運走、近復有大量鐵砂、亦被分批運走、前三日有日運輸艦山形丸、自長江中抵滬、裝有此項鐵砂千餘噸、又在浦江中附載廠鐵千餘噸、一併運回日本、</p>

<p>昨日上午、法租界安納金路及杜神父路與貝勒路之間、連續發生開槍暗殺案兩起、被殺者均係僞組織之傀儡、一爲現任南市僞地方法院院長武進人屠振鵠、一爲現充僞警察局水巡隊書記天津人高鴻藻、兩人均傷中要害、當塲身死、而兩案兇手均得從容逸去、茲將當時情形、分述於下、</p>
<p>（一）屠振鵠</p>
<p>曾任律師</p>
<p>曾於民國二十二年二月間加入上海律師公會爲會員之武進人屠振鵠、字寳彝、最近更名屠復、年五十二歲、在滬執行律務、巳五載、與其繼室屠袁氏、（三十六歲蘇州人）同居於法租界貝勒路底徐家滙路口恒慶里五弄廿四號、</p>
<p>出任僞職</p>
<p>上年秋末、屠鑽營得南京「維新政府」之邪路、出任上海南市僞地方法院院長後、因上海法院原址、屋宇巳被焚燬、屠乃擇定蓬萊路西城小學校址、從事佈置、於本年一月一日、草草成立、宣告視事、幷委同業中之費國禧·陳國才兩律師、任民刑庭庭長</p>
<p>防範綦嚴</p>
<p>而屠每日赴院辦公、於早晨離寓、至深晚始歸、出入隨帶護衛十餘人、以防意外、即在南市僞法院內、亦請僞警局撥派僞警多名、駐院保護、近數日屠不赴南巿辦公、在寓深居簡出</p>
<p>突遭狙擊</p>
<p>昨日上午十一點三刻、屠由恒慶里廿四號寓所、身穿靑灰色長袍、外罩黑馬褲呢大衣出外、由恒慶里穿至天祥里、（兩里戰事後貫通）、詎甫至五十三號過街樓下時忽有壯漢一人、由屠之身前冲出、拔槍向屠連開三槍、屠不及躱避、致被擊中頭部、右眉角、與胸前</p>
<p>當塲身死</p>
<p>計乳傍中兩彈、另一彈則擊落屠頭上之呢帽、屠受創倒地、因均傷在要害、即時氣絕身死、而開槍之男子、見目的巳達·即從容出弄而去、迨法捕房得報、派大批探捕趕到、兇手已遠麗無蹤、僅檢獲彈壳三枚、</p>
<p>捕房偵查</p>
<p>探等在弄中阻止交通、經詳加偵查、幷無所獲、至十二點半時、屠之屍身、經過拍照手續後、舁往台拉斯脫路工部局醫院內騐屍所候騐、一面由捕房傳屠妻袁氏到案偵訊、</p>
<p>（二）高鴻藻</p>
<p>僞隊書記</p>
<p>天津人高鴻藻、現年卅六歲、前在上海市公安局西門分局書記室充當錄事自上年發生戰事、南市淪陷、國軍西移、上海市公安局結束後、高營謀得充僞上海市大道市政府警察局水巡隊書記</p>
<p>與妾同居</p>
<p>高寓居法租界安納金路金裕里內之敦仁里廿五號三層樓亭子間內、與妾同居、其妻室子女則仍住天津原籍、昨晨七點四十分時、高由寓起身、穿黑呢西裝、外罩咖啡色厚呢大衣、頭戴呢帽、足登革履、由寓所出外</p>
<p>被擊身死</p>
<p>詎甫步出安納金路全裕里弄口、跨至馬路時、突有壯漢兩人、由路傍躍出、袖出手槍、對準高連開數槍、高猝不及防、致頭部被擊中三彈、即倒於一四五號潤康新南貨店、與一四七號一本煤炭店之門前、旋卽氣絕身死、</p>
<p>兇手遠颺</p>
<p>而行兇之兩壯漢、見目的已達、遂返身揚長而去、經法捕房得報、立派大批中西探馳往調查、並由總巡捕房攝影股西人携帶器具到塲、將死者所倒斃之處、拍照備查、並由探員在該處檢獲彈壳數枚、</p>
<p>流彈傷人</p>
<p>高之尸體舁送台拉斯脫路工部局醫院、（卽小病房）附設之騐尸所、候今日報請特二法院派員檢騐、當壯渶開槍殺高之際、子彈橫飛、有住在金裕里十六號之老嫗呂王氏、行經該處、致被擊傷倒地、由補房車送廣慈醫院醫治、</p>

<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>抗戰第二期的工作，行政重於軍事，實在是有眞知灼見的說法。最近行政院通令各機關，組織「促進行政效率委員會」，正可以作爲這種說法的證明。</p>
<p>過去我們在行政上有多少缺點，大槪都在我們的聞見中，也無庸諱言。其中最普遍的，便是洩洩沓沓，成爲習慣，似乎凡事不痛不癢，儘可以過日子。直到八一三的砲聲響了，才將這個迷夢驚破，而由此缺點所迭成的破綻，也就一槪暴露了出來。現在，政府勵精圖治，與民更始，發出了這樣的通令，眞呌我們寄着無限的期望。因爲只有行政有了效率，庶政才能上軌道，而抗戰的力量才能切實增加，而立於不敗之地。</p>
<p>國家如此，團體，會社，甚至家庭，也莫不如此。往往在某一個團體中，其中的成員，一些不奮發，過着因循敷衍的日子，以爲長此以往，儘可以安坐而食。一旦遭了橫逆，或者意外的壓逼，便弄得手忙脚亂，不知所措。假使這團體能够羣策羣力，一致奮鬭，增進行政效率，這團體就有復興的希望，否則這團體的消滅，必將成爲不可避免的慘果。</p>
<p>不過原則是如此，方法又將怎樣呢？當然，方法多得很，我們來不及在這裏條舉　析。但是我們也可以有方法上的原則，來作爲我們進行的標準。不是別的，就是耍有組織，有計劃，要因時制宜，因事設人，因利乘便，……總之，凡事要通盤打算過，然後分工合作，按步就班，各人飛速地幹着。人人有此决心，固然爲最要緊，但人人有一定的辦法，有確實遵行這辦法的决心，尤爲重要。否則儘有努力向上之心，而依然漆黑一團，無所措手足，於事何補呢！現在政府的通令，也就是這個道理吧。</p>
<p>外國人時常說我們不知組織，沒有計劃。現在我們的政府，已經有所表見，一雪此恥了，我不知道依然散漫的各團體，各會社，甚至各家庭，有動於中否！</p>

<p>— 千山</p>
<p>「萬人如海一身藏！」</p>
<p>心裏萌起「藏」，便有一般酸溜溜的滋味。醋麼？淚麽？橄欖的酸澀麽？</p>
<p>是自尊心被鞭箠呢！—這麼庸碌地，躱在一個角落里，分享人生的歡宴。是歡筵也是酸辛的苦酒呢！彷彿經過了一度的傳杯，而酒味已變了。消損，如蟲蝕；寂寞，如黃昏：漠然，如虛白，絕緣，如隔世。迥繞在周遭，是狂笑，是人潮，是獸鬨，是鬼泣，…但這些喧鬧於我何有呢？躱在一角落，分享人生之歡宴，偸嚼着牙慧與唾餘，別人不知道我，我却不知道別人。</p>
<p>彷彿「項脊」那末大一個軒，躱藏着一顆從前是活躍但今已靜穆的心。像輕球的拋擲，把一個人從舊夢中拋出。彷彿李迫一塲鼾睡，醒時，抹抹眼晴，現象已非了。遼東之故鶴，更從何認識那些城郭與人家？</p>
<p>慷慨高歌，結客少年塲上的豪氣，元龍湖海，巳不賴人世的滄桑。撕去舊日的喧囂，厮磨着今天的冷僻。沸天的歌管，誰說不是歡情？迥繞在周遭，誰說沒有聲音？是狂笑，是人潮，是獸閧，是鬼泣，…然而這些喧闐，於我何有呢？</p>
<p>都市的噪聒，與我是無綠的。那些歡笑也是秋蟲的呻吟啊！腐敗的細菌，佈滿在都市，包圍着我，令我厭倦，憎恨，躲藏；然而我更不能忘記那些豺狼的奔號，千家的野哭，天陰雨濕時寃鬼的啁啾，…誰能裝聾作啞呢？雖然我是悶在「項脊」般的室中，一粒眇小的芥子內，但我的耳已長上荊棘，我的背已刺滿芒針。「藏」的苦，已十分侷促，但偏隱不住人世的悲酸。我一面分担着他人的苦酒，一壁咀嚼着牙慧與唾餘。是兩重的悲哀啊！相迫，相感，相糾纏。</p>
<p>熊熊的火，爲烟，爲光，爲熱，爲蛇舌，爲龍髯，散向四方，冲開八表：一張薄紙，豈能相隱，使火燼淪爲寒灰？就算一堆舊夢壓住了我吧，我亦須衝開那些迷霧，那一片濛濛的迷霧呵！</p>
<p>轅下駒的侷促，已不耐守在這小屋中了。小屋中，是只有呌入愚昧，昏蒙，疲倦，卑陋的。將生命的血紅，儘塗抹在窗牖上，屋簷下，看不見遼闊的大地，羣衆的生命，我何能堪？</p>
<p>懷若雄渾的心情，遙望那遼闊，那高空，想像中的「南溟」，</p>
<p>無涯的「南溟」啊！我想飛！</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>—戰地旅行雜感—</p>
<p>蔣百里先生把日本民族比作英沙士比亞悲劇中的人物—哈姆來脫，比擬得非常切當。所謂悲劇的性格，就是內在精神上有幾種不可消解的矛盾並存着。矛盾呢，本來不可免的，但得有一種力轉動其他的力，作相對的調和，儘是對立起來，那就變成內在的力相磨擦以至相消，這便是一個大悲劇。在柏拉圖的共和國寡，有一段關於幸福的神話，說有一位使者召集了地獄裏的幽靈，對他們說；</p>
<p>過路的衆魂，你們將開始一個新的途程，進入一個會得死減的肉體中。你們的命運，並不由神明來代爲選擇而將由你們自己選擇。用抽籤來决定選擇的次序，第一個輪到的，便第一個選擇，但一經選擇，命運即爲决定，不可更改的了……那時候，使者在衆魂前而　下許多包裏，每包之中藏有一個命運，每個幽　可在其中檢取他所希冀的一個。那第一個輪着有選擇權的幽靈，牠熱中地上前，端相着一堆可觀的暴力，他貪心地，冒失地拿起，帶走了；隨後富他把那雙袋搜羅到底時，發見他的命運註定要殺死他自己的孩子，並要犯共他的大罪。於是他連哭帶怒，指責神明，指責一切，甚麽都被詛咒了。</p>
<p>這位食心而冒失的幽靈，可以說，便是日本民族。</p>
<p>歷史告訴我們，一個民族的野心和她的貪心，不能兩全的；貪心很大的民族，必不能遂她的野心。羅馬是一個野心極大的國家，她固然征服了許多民族，但她並不要滅絕那些民族，她兼收並蓄，故能成其大。西班牙，葡萄牙都是貧心極大的民族，她的殺鵝以求金蛋的殖民政策，終於失去大部分殖民地；英國採取一種較開明的殖民政策，貪心减低，其第一帝國的野心畢竟如願了。蘇俄沙皇貪心極重，共南進東進野心都受了打擊；蘇俄放棄了侵峪的貪心，其建立無產階級民主國的大野心終於實現。這都是實證。</p>
<p>我們冉來看日本民族，一邊是一個大野心，如田中內閣奏議所說的，建立一個亘古未有的亞　亞洲大帝國，三分世界；一邊却是一個大食心，想把中華民族四萬五千萬人連皮帶骨吃到肚子裏去，把歐美各國的東方勢力一脚踢開去；無雜馬民挨的氣度，而要想建立比羅馬帝國還偉大的帝國，此之謂『不度德，不量力。』</p>
<p>我和珂雲在魯南隨軍時，她聽了日軍把自己的傷兵活燒的故事，心爲之慘痛。她說：『我彷彿聽見敵人的傷兵在火焰中呌喊！我說道便是那位貪愛暴力的那位冒失的幽靈，他的命運註定要殺死他自己的孩子！日本民族的性格，用佛語來說：—缺少一些菩薩性子。孟子說：「以不忍人之心行不忍人之政。」日本的軍閥政治，就是以忍人之心行忍人之政，我們可以斷定其必然的悲劇結局—野心未遂而食慾莫塡，空犧牲了日本民衆的血（經濟）和肉（生命）。</p>

<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『殺！』指揮刀在暗空中劃破了一條銀允，落下來就刺到躱在坦克車後面的敵軍身上，敵軍似乎完全沒有肉捕的經騐，只是慌亂地用手裏的步槍招架。葉團長施展出他在軍校裏嫻習的劈刺技術，很快的就把敵軍刺死了三個，其餘的敵軍，狼狽地拖着槍潰退下去了。正在肉搏的兵士們，若見團長親自出來衝鋒，都興奮得發了瘋似的，敵軍終於心虛氣怯的支持不住，全綫潰敗，連那幾輛鐵甲車和坦克車都來不及退回去。</p>
<p>這是葉團長出馬以來的第一次勝仗，完全穩定了國防陣綫王江涇的陣地。</p>
<p>葉團長回到原防來，就遇見了師部的馮參謀長。</p>
<p>『你眞勇敢！』馮參謀長伸出大拇指向葉團長說：『不過你像一部份軍官一樣，喜歡毫無掩蔽的把全身暴露在敵前，這實在不足取法；要知道軍隊裹把團營長看得很重要呢。』</p>
<p>『這也顧不得許多了。』葉團長微笑說：『我只要一想到國家受外寇的欺凌，心頭就像火燒一樣。』</p>
<p>『告訴你一個好消息，』馮參謀長得意地說：『剛才接到前方電話，平湖敵被我壓迫，有後退的模樣，楓涇嘉善兩車站已被我克復，這裏的危機可說完全解除了。』</p>
<p>『眞的嗎？』葉團長高興得幾乎跳將起來，似乎方才打的勝仗，還沒有他聽到這消息時那樣喜歡。</p>
<p>然而這喜歡的時間並不怎樣長久，以後的幾天，幾乎天天都處於失望之中，警報接二連三的傳來。左翼和中路，失陷的地方很多，整個國防陣錢都起了震動。但最重要的還是右翼方面，嘉興我軍只守了兩天，因爲敵軍的砲火過於猛烈，城牆和工事全毀，只得忍痛退出。敵軍在攻下了嘉興以後，便開始進犯烏鎭南潯，因爲王江涇是水陸交通要道，從那邊可以由水路用汽艇運兵去抄襲南潯的後路，所以對這一路的進攻，非常積極。</p>
<p>在左右兩翼形勢危急的時候，葉團長所隸屬的那一師，便巳奉到了最高軍事當局的命令，和其他恊同防守的友軍，一律西撤到吳興長興，但葉團長却仍舊奉令負起了掩護撤退的仟務，用他那一團兵力，死守着這國防陣綫上的最後一個據點。這一個掩護撤退的任務，是又具體地完成了。</p>
<p>可是葉團長這一團兵力却從此變成了孤軍。起初師部還接連打軍用電話來，催他們趕快撤退，以後忽然寂無音訊，顯然烏鎭南潯的戰局又起了新的變化，軍用電話已被破壞，於是他們和後方的聯絡便完全隔絕了。</p>
<p>但葉團長的堅毅的意志，却使他雖在萬難的環境裹，仍舊不肯退出這最後陣地，儘管部隊裏已經沒有重砲，只能用步槍機關槍小鋼砲來和敵人猛烈的砲火對抗。</p>
<p>在大砲炸彈輕重機關槍和排槍的複雜合奏下，傳令兵坌息地像昏了頭一樣的奔來報告消息：</p>
<p>『報告團長，第七連只剩下十二個人了，怎麽辦？』</p>
<p>『去！去！告訴他們，就是只剩下一個人，也要死守到底。』葉團長揮着手，固執地說。他凛然的站在硝烟彈雨裏，那一張國字臉，就好像是生鐵鑄成的一樣。（一五）</p>

<h3 id="c75">中國發明已久之臟器療法（一） <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 謝也農</p>
<p>動物臟器，歐美人士向來視爲棄物，且認有碍衛生，不屑進食。自臟器療法發明，於是舉世重之。中國實發明其功用已久，略述如次：</p>
<p>猪脾（俗名肚子），巿上各肉店都有可買，價格低賤，此物爲疳積小癆病特效良藥。緣小兒脾胃薄弱，消化力不强，飲食過飽，或多吃零食，積滯腸胃中，阻碍脾胃腸壁之蠕動，失却腐化能力，而引起消化不良，變成疳癆。俗語謂「只吃飯，勿長肉，活食袋在死脾裏」，蓋形容其能食而不能化也。猪脾能健運脾胃，去積導滯，輔助消化，故治療此症，具有特效。疳癆至危重時期，大概有二種不同之症象：　腹部臌大，肌肉消瘦，潮熱口乾，舌上光紅，虛汗煩躁；　大便塘瀉，面色靑黯，氣急目陷，形瘦骨立，精神枯萎。猪脾雖能統治二種病症，然須分別加用藥物。</p>
<p>先向肉店購新鮮猪脾，洗掙，用刀劃碎幾條，入磁盆中，再用藥粉摻脾上。——　種症用珠兒參粉。　種症用五倍子粉。（藥店有買，可代研粉）。——然後置飯鍋上蒸熱，切成小塊，停止病者飲食，飢餓卽食猪脾，病愈爲止。此法曾屢試而屢騐。</p>
<p>猪羊睪丸　陽痿病除先天遺傳性外，大都因性慾過度，腎虧精不充其力所致，療法宜補陰以助陽，不可用興奮藥物，壯陽以刧陰。西法取獸之某部內分泌，注射於人體某部，國醫則用猪羊畢丸治之，兩者同一意義。宰取猪羊睪丸，陳酒浸數小時，榨汁飲之；不煮熟而食者，恐失其有效成分也。尙有一法，以白蓮子研粉，用猪羊脊髓搗爲丸，每日服四十丸，亦可補精强腎。</p>
<h3 id="c76">鹿茸海藻 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 王介人</p>
<p>鹿茸爲我國共知之大補品，通俗以爲身體虛弱者，皆可購服，但其性廿溫純陽，能生精補髓，强筋健骨，治一切虛損勞傷之症，脈細相火衰弱者，極有效力，爲治療神經衰弱者之良品，若痰火熱體服之，不但於病無補，反且有害，實類抱薪救火，故必先問於醫生，方無憤事。</p>
<p>海藻昆布爲海產食物，我國自古卽供藥用。如本經云：「海藻主治癭瘤結氣，散頸下硬核堅氣」。又名醫別錄云：「海藻療皮間積聚，暴潰，瘤氣結熱，利小便等」，皆因其中含碘之成分最多，而碘對於癭瘤，瘰癧，惡瘡等症，尤爲特效藥物，近時有人採爲製碘之原料者甚多，故患瘰癧者煮茶常食之，確有淸血排毒變質之奇效。</p>
<h3 id="c77">小兒食物宜忌 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 汪駝</p>
<p>諺云：若要小兒安，常帶三分飢與寒。因使小兒飲食過飽，則腹中每多積食，健康易受影響也。</p>
<p>小兒二歲以上者，宜每日四餐，餐後略進蘋果，橘子，雅梨，甘蔗等水菓，以潤腸胃，而助消化。十歲以上者，每日三餐，下午略與點心充飢。至小兒通常宜食之物，爲鷄蛋，蔬菜，牛肉汁，鷄汁，牛乳魚肉，麵包等，因以上各物，富於營養料，小兒食之，能充分調劑內體各部，且易於消化，無食積之患。</p>
<p>小兒最宜禁忌者，則餐後禁絕零食，夜睡時禁食點心，以防疳積。小兒進食，大忌偏嗜，多數皆喜食糖果，花生，豆，生山苧，芝蔴之類，不知糖果易使胃中發酵，障碍消化；花生如不細嚼，則停積腸胃，有碍健康；豆，山芋，芝蔴壅滯氣道，多食腹大而脹。凡此皆與健康有碍，爲父母者最宜注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c78">豆腐靑菜 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 許錦濤</p>
<p>豆腐富於蛋白質，爲植物中之肉類，與鷄蛋牛肉同功；然鷄蛋有時能助長細菌之復活，牛肉有時使脂肪過於肥壅，而豆腐無斯弊。豆芽爲補心臟之上品，兼助腎臟之濾泌。凡患心臟病與淋泌病者，以豆芽煎湯飲之爲最宜。</p>
<p>共他如靑菜可以暢肺葉之呼吸，而滌蕩留蝕之斑點；蘿葡可以轉脾絡之動旋，而消化不良之積滯。肉食者流，宜常調劑食之。此皆吾人習知其味，視爲日常食品；不知調劑臟腑，營養生元，增加抗毒素，抵制疾病功能，盡在此類植物之中，固不能以價賤而鄙視之也。</p>
<h3 id="c79">介紹六種補品（下） <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 胡祥麟</p>
<p>羊肉粥　製法：羊肉山藥各四兩，煮熱搗爛，加米煮粥食之。羊肉能補虛勞益氣，配以滋養健胃之山藥，以代老年人之夜膳，不惟味美，並能補身。五妙湯製法：豆汁（豆腐漿）一盌，龍眼肉（桂元）一盃，乘熱冲入生鷄蛋一個（須打鬆）廣橘皮一張，白糖一兩。豆汁鷄卵之富滋養，盡入皆知，龍眼肉養心安神，橘皮調氣開胃，故此湯不但可治消化不良，亦神經衰弱者之良友。</p>
<p>益脾餅　製法：熟棗肉半斤，白朮四兩，鷄內金乾姜各二兩；先將白朮鷄金研細焙熟，再將乾姜研末，和棗肉內搗如泥，作小餅，木炭火上烘乾。此餅健康人食之，固有益於腸胃；消化不良或泄瀉胃秘者，食之尤能止瀉進食。以貽小兒尤宜。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c80">橄欖治咽喉症 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 葛希文</p>
<p>咽喉在人體生理上，確佔一極重耍之地位，試觀吾人所以能生存於世間者，一賴氣息之呼吸，一靠飲食之運輸，二者無不假道於咽喉，故稱其爲呼吸出人之門戶；倘一旦氣息窒塞，或水穀不進，即有生命危險。可知咽喉雖如彈丸之地，而其重要則關於生命之安危</p>
<p>咽喉在小舌（父名帝丁）之下，有一小竅，其在左者爲咽，在右者爲喉，咽竅通於胃，即爲食管，以運納水穀；喉竅通於肺，即是氣管，以主司呼吸。大凡咽喉患病，多屬氣候亢燥，嗜食辛辣，風火蘊蓄上升，肺胃熱痰留積等因所致。但分門別類，則喉症之種類極夥，故致病之原因不一，如白喉，猩紅熱，喉痧，纏喉風，走馬喉風，喉癬，乳蛾等，皆係極險惡之疾病，患者切勿漠視，一經發覺，急須延良醫診治，萬勿因循致誤，而成不治之症，因此類險症，每易變化於頃刻也。</p>
<p>橄欖，人皆知其爲消香可口之消閒果品，但對於咽喉却具「有百利無一弊」之功效。考本草：橄攬一名諫果，性酸甘溫無毒，功能開胃下氣，生津液，止煩渴，治咽喉痛，咀嚼嚥汁能解一切魚鱉毒。觀乎此，則知橄欖之與吾人，確爲最有益之果品矣。橄欖不特能治咽喉疼痛諸症，凡在喉痧猖獗盛行之時，每日常嚼數枚或取六七枚煎湯代茶，皆有頂防傳染之功效；尤其在隆冬嚴寒時節，置有煤爐人家，能常喫幾枚或時含口中，更能免煤毒燻灼，减去喉嚨乾燥。</p>

<h3 id="c81">安眠良藥 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 丁濟華</p>
<p>一月之中，偶而失眠數次，不足爲病，由偶然而成習慣，由習慣而現種種病象，如頭痛心跳，胃呆便秘，記憶衰弱等，斯乃成病。此病之患者，體都虛弱，體虛思煩，則易於失眠，愈失眠則體愈虛，遂成極端痛苦。病輕者尙可勉强支持，病深者不得不服市上所售之安眠藥，以濟一時之急。茲將國產安眠良藥，擇其易於服用而確有功效者，介紹於下：</p>
<p>硃砂安神丸　此丸專治心神煩亂，頭痛便閉，心肝火旺之失眠，每决臨睡前服十五丸，開水送下，病愈停服。</p>
<p>琥珀多寐丸　此丸專治心血不足，腎氣虧損，心跳，記憶力衰弱，睡後累醒，心神恍惚之失眠。臨睡前二小時，每次吞服五分，用硃燈心煎湯送下，以愈爲度。</p>
<p>天王補心丹　此丸專治思慮過度，心血不足，心跳健忘，大便或閉或搪，屢屢失眠。每服二錢，用桂圓煎湯送服，時間不拘。尙有北平藥局之袖腦安睡丸亦可服用，患者可先向國藥店索取此三種丸劑之仿單，詳細審閱，擇合於自己病情者服之。</p>
<h3 id="c82">山藥糕 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 張三思</p>
<p>山樂能補虛勞，常食，益氣力，强筋骨，有培元益精之功。北方人多喜食之。其種類極多，凡形如圓柱，皮帶紅色者均不佳；扁而帶白色者爲淮山藥，補力最大。但以白水燒熟或蒸熟食，微嫌澀麻，不如山藥泥之易於人口。但味最美者當推山藥糕。茲將其做法詳述於後：先將山藥蒸熟，剝去皮，俟其冷透，加粳米粉（只要有山藥數量三分之一）及白糖，生猪油槐等置入石曰內春爛拌勻，然後攤入長方形之鐵盤內，上蒸籠蒸熱，用刀劃成長方塊。如須有香味，可再加桂花糖，則香甜可口，不復澀麻。患肺癆病及虛症者，每日食數塊，旣能增加身體抵抗力，且可充飢適口。</p>
<h3 id="c83">食養識小錄 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>關於食養稿件，各方投寄者甚多；存稿山積，茲因篇幅關係，不及一一錄登全文，特闢此欄，以納精萃。雖一鱗半爪，要多經騐之談，想亦爲讀者所愛閱也。</p>
<p>冬瓜液療虛腫</p>
<p>用冬瓜一個，於蒂部切去一蓋，挖盡子　，人冰糖一斤，仍將蓋蓋住，就炭爐上薰炙，俟瓜肉化水，冰糖融盡，取其液緩緩飲之，可治病後虛腫，輕者一次即愈，重者三次必愈。</p>

<p>海參有益婦女</p>
<p>常用海參同火腿同煮，以代他肴，則有孕之婦少難產之虞，經事不調者亦可漸復正常。產後食之，大補氣血。</p>
<p>— （沈林）</p>
<p>落花生治黃腫</p>
<p>落花生性辛香，能行氣，故凡陽氣不運，水濕停留，致成黃腫之症者，可多食落花生，至兩斤之多。</p>
<p>— （愈生）</p>
<p>山楂粉愈赤痢</p>
<p>以山楂粉一兩（即山楂炭研末），與紅糖若干拌和，煮成濃茶，飲之可愈赤痢。因山楂有消食積，去油汚之功，紅糖則有去積生新之效，以治赤痢，自易收功。</p>
<p>— （周錦濤）</p>
<p>脚氣病之食養</p>
<p>患脚氣病者除急應改食未經春碾過度之糙米外，平日又應多食落花生，黃豆，碗豆，新鮮蔬菜及橘子汁等，以增加體內營養素。</p>
<p>— （姚若琴）</p>
<p>虛癆病與火腿</p>
<p>火腿味甘鹹溫，益脾開胃，頗補氣血。可將整塊洗凈，置大碗中就飯鍋上乾蒸六七次，至極爛，然後食之，可治虛癆之症。或熬湯，撇去浮油，但飲其汁亦可。</p>

<h3 id="c84">傷寒症之病情變化及食養程序（七） <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>乙，傷寒寒熱退後之第五日起</p>
<p>食料方面，可增多四種：　麵包，　焦米粥，　冬霜米粥，　稀薄米粥。飲料方面可增多二種：　牛肉汁，　童鷄汁。</p>
<p>菜肴方面可配食：　素菜湯，　紹興乾菜湯，　菠菜蛋白湯，　番茄湯，　蛋花湯，　鴨湯，　鷄血湯，　菠菜豬肝湯，　鷄湯，　絲瓜湯。尙有可食而不忌之物品爲：冬瓜，麵筋，山藥，烤麩，火腿，肉鬆，白菜干，乾菜筍，筍衣，香菌，豆腐皮，豆腐衣，通心粉，扁尖及各種醬菜。</p>
<p>上所舉名目甚多，可供病者更換選用，但終屬不宜多食，决數不妨稍多，量數不可過多。第十日起可食較厚米粥，第十五日起可食軟飯，（如陳米，冬霜米，香粳米之類）上列所舉日期，尙須視病之輕重而有仲縮。但粥飯一類必須按此决序，早食米飯，最易復病，病後總以富於營養易於消化之流汁爲最宜，故傷寒病後，鷄汁，牛肉汁雖屬葷品，實爲不可缺少之養身妙品也。（全篇完）</p>
<h3 id="c85">透發痘疹冬筍鯽魚湯 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 秦伯未</p>
<p>冬筍鯽魚湯，係一鮮美之佳肴，同時亦爲透發痘疹之妙品。際茲時氣不正，天花流行，特爲表而出之。</p>
<p>冬筍氣味甘寒，主治小兒痘疹不出，並能解毒，有透發之力，詳載本草網目。鯽魚甘溫，能調中益五臟，內經謂魚類使人熱中，凡痘症見點，必須溫託，促其灌漿。二者之性質，恰相符合。</p>
<p>煮食之時，取鯽魚去腸雜洗凈，以冬筍切片，加水淡煮，（切勿入鹽豉　葱之屬）頻飲其湯，但在灌漿期內爲妥，非病中長宜之飲料也。又筍有滑利大腸之弊，無益於脾，故大便溏薄者應忌。</p>
<p>此係民問單方之一，近來醫家亦多採用，以助藥力；而單用筍片於方劑者，尤多。</p>

<h3 id="c97">勞來與哈台 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 玉全</p>
<p>偶然在一張畫報上看見一幅漫畫；上面畫着勞來與哈台的滑稽面孔，下面畫着墨索里尼與希特勒，也畫得一胖一瘦的十分有趣，旁邊附印了下面幾句話；「世界上有二對勞來哈台，一對在好萊塢新近要拆班，一對你猜是誰？要不要拆班？」</p>
<p>勞來和哈台，可說是一對老搭擋了，他們在好萊塢是數一數二的滑稽明星，且爲全世界影迷所歡迎。但是如果有了勞來而沒有哈台，或祇有哈台而缺少了勞來，那就要孤掌難鳴，不能收牡丹綠葉之效，演出來的戲劇，也不會怎樣的有趣了；所以這兩人應該相依爲命才是，不知爲什麼却要拆班，一般影迷都十分可惜，這就是所謂「合久必分」的道理吧。</p>
<p>至於希特勒和墨索里尼配成搭擋，那不用說，他們自然要有一番驚人的演出了，所怕的就是恐怕他們也不能逃出那「合久必分」的道理，和勞來哈台一樣的不能維持着永久的友誼，而終至拆班，那就不會有什麼噱頭了，不知他們是吾是和勞來哈台一樣的命運呢</p>
<p>記得本埠某影院曾開映過勞來與哈台主演的「袖裏乾坤」，這影片裏勞來與哈台，都是沒出息的扒手，時常因分贓不勻，而發生內鬨，結果是被捉將官裏去行刑，兩個人都變成怪模怪樣的形狀，這倒和墨索里尼和希特勒所演出的差不多，因爲他們也是想把整個「乾坤」扒到自已衣袖裏去啊！但是這兩個都是貪得無饜的朋友，分起贓物來，誰肯多少一點呢？說不定還有第三者在旁邊「努力」，這一來，不打緊，大家恐怕就要不客氣起來，都不能顧及那「互不侵犯」的條約了，到了那時，卽使「拆班」也不能解决一切，恐怕要打得頭破血流，同歸於盡而後已了。</p>
<h3 id="c98">木蘭從軍 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>（一）製作歷史電影的態度</p>
<p>採取歷史上（或民間）的故事來作爲電影題材，在目前的「孤島」上，巳成爲國產電影取材的新途徑了。巳公映的，如「貂蟬」，「武松與潘金蓮」等；現在又同時有三部新作品公映：國華的「孟姜女」，藝華的「楚覇王」，及這部華成的「木蘭從軍」。對於這新的傾向的發展，似乎頗引起國產片觀衆的注意：「爲什麼製作歷史電影」？我彷彿聽到過這樣關切的發問。</p>
<p>在敵人處心積慮向中國電影事業進攻的時候，在客觀環境限止這樣嚴密的現在，我們應該如何從艱難困苦的壓迫中打開一條血路，使用電影這「武器」及這「武器」所要我們負起的責任，確是一個値得注意的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>在最近一個時期中，凡從事於電影事業的每一份子，都巳看淸楚了我們當前的危機，那末，攝製歷史電影决不是逃避責任是很明顯的了。不過，製作歷史電影應該確定唯一的態度，就是並不是把歷史上（或民間）的古色古香，和可歌可泣的故事，依樣畫葫蘆地搬上銀幕就了事，而是應該通過了劇作者的正準的觀點，從古人身上灌輸以配合這大時代的新生命；換一句話說，祇要在並不十分違背史實記載的原則下，把有意義的部份加以强調，沒有意義的部份儘量减削，甚至全部揚棄。</p>
<p>（二）銀幕上的「木蘭從軍」</p>
<p>「木蘭從軍」是一個民間故事，「唧唧復唧唧，木蘭當戶織」曾選爲小學敎科書讀本，這也可算是個家喻戶曉的民間故事了。但是這個故事之所以傳流迄今，不外是「阿爺無大兒，木蘭無長兄」的花木蘭能够「從此巷爺征」這一點「孝意」感動了後人的緣故。現在銀幕上的花木蘭，當然仍是個「孝女」，但是她的「孝」是在「盡忠報國」的大前題之下而確定了它的新的價値，「誓將此生報家國，××故劍斬離情」！這是多麼有力的證明！</p>
<p>而且在「將軍百戰死，壯士十年歸」的中間，劇作者更無情地剝露了當時幾個人物的面具，—這幾個人物在現在的我們看起來，還是十分熟悉的。如：作爲丑角的老韓和老劉，被花木蘭是這樣敎訓過來的：「如今邊關緊急，大家前去投軍，無非是爲國效勞，决沒有自己人還欺負自己人的道理！」那個自誇「李家村的人都是文武雙全」的老趙，也祇是扭着木蘭胡調，而在木蘭得勝歸的時候，却父是「他是我的老朋友」地「自我陶醉」起來了。描寫得最眞切却輪到「好好的事情看看斷送在奸細之手」的那位軍師，在他身上，我們彷彿透過了他的心臟一樣，看到了大開「和平之門」的影子。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩與陳雲裳</p>
<p>這里，我不得不對歐陽先生和陳雲裳表示最高的敬意。</p>
<p>關於劇本的編製，因爲篇幅關係，簡單寫一點如下。　木蘭的性格：歐陽對於這位現代木蘭的性格，是自始至終抓住了她的靈魂的，一開始，寫她到李家村去打獵，因爲她一箭誤射了李家村的老王，被他們圍住的時候，木蘭是那樣不慌不忙應付這一批無輯，使計脫逃，這點就淸花木蘭是個文武雙全，智謀過人的女英雄，後來的她和元度去探刺軍情，洞燭奸謀，指揮殺敵就並不見過兀突了。　平劇風味：「木蘭從軍一不能否認是含有着平劇風味的，或許是「桃花扇」所給我的印象太深了，感到這平劇風味的可愛。如：李家村人圍着木蘭的時候，那些調笑的「小木蘭，下馬來咱們談談。」「小木蘭，不害羞，不會打獵只會偷。」「小木蘭，小乖乖，要找男人我這兒來。」小木蘭，別囉囌、我還沒有娶老婆。」這都有平劇「詞兒」的風味的，其他的例子還有，如「誓將此生報家國，××故劍斬離情！」又像平劇中的「引子。」　兒女之私：歐陽先生描寫兒女之私是有獨到之處的，「木蘭從軍」中寫得最精彩的是木蘭和元度在營帳中唱「月亮在那里」的一段，眞是細膩溫馨，風趣傳神。　三支挿曲：「月亮在那里」如上述；「太陽一出滿天下」雖然是在木蘭和小同伴們遊戲時唱的，但第二首中「太陽一出滿大下，快把工夫練好他，强盜賊來都不怕，一齊送他們回老家！」也見作者的用意了；「三人同走一條道呀」這支歌，頗有異國情調，而且非常適合劇情。</p>
<p>陳雲裳，這位從南國到『孤島』來的影星，這一部作品的成功，似乎足够償還她到溫帶上來所受的不舒適了。她的木蘭，開始時的小女兒之態，活潑可愛，替父從軍時之正義，及改換軍裝後的英俊，行止，對話的姿態都達於臻化之境。尤其是營帳中的一塲戲，和梅熹對唱「月亮在那里，」把女兒家的心理演得淋漓盡緻。嗓音轉變也很自然。</p>
<p>她的下一部作品倒眞是値得我們注意的。（據說她曾有拒演「雲裳仙子」的表示，不知確否？）</p>
<p>導演及其他</p>
<p>卜萬蒼是「貂蟬」的導演，如今來導演這部「木蘭從軍」，可以說是導演古裝片的熟手了。「貂蟬」和「木蘭從軍」有一個明顯的特點，就是前者的調子是非常沉重的，後者是流利而輕快。對於大塲面的處理，還是和貂蟬」一樣，不免有紊亂之處。梅熹的劉元度，在後半部戲中，演得很够味，不過前面太缺少英雄氣槪，和木蘭對比之下，好像太軟弱了。沙漠及營帳等幾塲的攝影都狠好。收音也淸晰。</p>
<p>爲了篇幅關係，雖遺漏之處很多，祇得帶住了。</p>
<p>最後，我誠意地向全滬觀衆推駕這部不可多得的電影。</p>
<h3 id="c99">邑廟市塲巡禮 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>「上海是寸金地」，這一句話，到現在的確表現得更共深刻了。任何一個角落裹的空地上，甚至荒地上，現在都被人利用着建造起高大的房屋，建造起廣闊的市塲，而趁這個人口擠居，市面畸形繁榮的機會裏，來經營買賣獲得盈餘。</p>
<p>在呂宋路的中段，一條短狹而僻靜的路上，一塊空曠而荒蕪的塲地上，又建築起了一所「邑廟市塲」，（十四日開幕），遠遠地望去，一排那麼低矮的屋子，架托着一個高聳的門樓，像城頭，像古刹，又像風雨亭。在外表的輪廓上，在五彩的色調上，在窗鬥的花紋上，都充分地表現着東方藝術建築美的姿態，保持着古典意味的品格，而同時，也會使人因之想念到上海中國佛敎策源地的邑廟的不幸的遭遇，神的力量巳經顯示了它的弱點，而現在是應該注意自己—人的力量了！</p>
<p>踏進大門，空氣是緊張的，動態是忙碌的，滿眼盡是燦爛炫耀的色調，新的屋子，新的商品，新的佈置，工作在這裏的人羣也因爲有一個新開始的生活源泉，而顯露着異樣的歡欣，異樣的得意，異樣的興奮！</p>
<p>兩條彎曲的小路，左右分開包夾着一所八角亭式的屋子；面積雖然小，但站在這邊却望不到那邊，空間盡是紙花，廣告，標　，人羣像螻蟻似的蠕動，來來往往，把一條條的小路都擁塞得極度飽滿，使人難以疾行。</p>
<p>這裏面的低矮屋子，間閣得那麽小小的一間一間（每間租金三十五元或六十元，另加小租二百元），堆滿了售賣的商品，有：布疋，食物，文具，玻璃，衣帽，鞋襪，藥料，紙張，玩具，胭脂？香粉，等等日用所必需的物件，以及迷信偶像所耗費的香燭，和賭博所用的麻雀牌，撲克等；各種商號工廠集結成這樣一個百貨巿塲，成爲日用物品的總匯，就像是每一個部門集結起來，成功一個社會，產生一種强大的動力是一樣的，假使不用每一個細胞的力量集結起來，那麼，不知道要籌集幾多萬塊錢才能成就一個市塲哩。雖然它沒有四公司那麼偉大，商品也沒有那麼廣泛，衆多，但却具有一個市塲的雛型，像內地的村鎭上似的，有一種簡樸的風味。</p>
<p>在信步徘徊着，徜徉着，觀摩着，由柬面慢慢地踱到西面，又由西面慢慢踱到東面；在那些商家的門前仔細看各種貨品的來歷，和它的製造工廠，瀏覽着各部門的佈置方式，注意他們內部的組織機構，同時，也留心望那些消費者的風度，趕然鬧的人羣底閑散形態。</p>
<p>現在，也許因爲是廢曆歲暮，消費的人特別多，在這市塲裹每一個部份，每種貨品，都有大量的買主，一包包一紮紥的提出去；富裕者在在都是不在乎的，祇要自己享受得適意，鈔票像草紙似的使用。因此，我們覺得現在的上海正需要更多的建築，正需要更多的生產和消費的組織，來供給一般人享受，容納一般失業羣，同時，也希望在市塲裏開拓國貨的出路，成爲純粹的國貨巿塲，俾能直接間接增厚抗戰的經濟力量，發揮國民的天職。</p>

<p>第四回　溯往事樂天傳妙語　締新交勝地作淸游</p>
<p>何雙玉又問道：『大槪也是戰塲上受了傷，在醫院裹鋸去的嗎？』趙樂天道：『戰爭的事，此刻也不用再提了。兩國相爭，兩國的人民有什麼深仇宿恨，你要殺我，找殺你。不過侵略者要減人的國奪人的地，凡有人心的，總要出來抵抗。我這條腿，爲了保衛國家而犧牲，也是保衛自己而犧牲。說起來，我也値得了，我雖然去了此條腿，人家在我手裏去掉的性命，也不知有多少。我是個機關槍手，我瞄得很準，我只輕輕一搖，敵兵傷亡在這一搖中的就很不少。所以我雖肢體傷殘，我倒只有懺悔的份兒，並沒怨恨的份兒。我抬到醫院裏去的當兒，滿以爲不能活了，此後的歲月，都是餘下來的餘生，所以我頗樂天安命，我的名字，就呌樂天。』三位小姐聽得很有興味，吳君素又問：『趙先生！你當初鋸下一條腿的時候，你自己是怎樣一種感覺呢？』趙樂天道：『那時巳是糊裏糊塗的了，還有什麽感覺？好在我那時父母雙亡，也沒討過老婆，只是一個光身漢子，眞是了無牽掛。他們把我的腿鋸去時候，是上了蒙藥的，昏昏沉沉，我也不知道。我中心銘感的，那幾位看護小姐，待我眞好。就是自己的姊妹，也沒有這樣。最可笑的，我的脚已經鋸去了，我還當沒有鋸去，我和一位看護的王小姐說：「我的脚背上癢起來了。」其實脚已沒有了，有什麼脚背？有什麼癢不癢？但是王小姐並不說穿我沒有脚，却安慰我道：「脚背上癢嗎？我來給你撫摩撫摩就好了。」後來我自己想到沒有脚，却要人搔癢，反而失笑了。她們並不笑，她們倒有背着我彈眼淚的。噯！我眞感激她們的好心腸，我至今還不能忘掉。」趙樂天說到那裏，瞧着這三位小姐，都有些感動，似乎顯出悲容。他便道：『我們不談這些。我是名喚樂天，持樂天主義者。我告訴你們一件事：我因爲是一條腿，很佔了一點便宜。』吳君素是個最性急的人，便問：『什麽事？趙光生佔了便宜？』趙樂天道：『到鞋子店裹買鞋子，人家要買一雙，我却只要買一隻。但一隻是不肯賣的，我買了一雙分兩决穿，可不便宜了。』（四一）</p>

<p>陳　雲裳主演一木闌從軍一，英姿颷爽，武藝超羣。在片中揮戈殺敵如　，而有目共諸而被殺的，計有六人以上。那天下導演對着陳小姐喟然長歎地說：「你到上海一個多月，已經殺死六個人了。這怎麼好呢」？陳小姐聞言，却裝出得意的笑容。</p>
<p>到沙漠駱駝落淚</p>
<p>「木蘭從軍」片中的沙漠大佈景，平沙無垠，一望千里，眞是偉大之至。那天僱了一頭駱駝做戲。那頭駱駝來滬已十六年之久，一見沙漠佈景，幾乎疑是回到牠的家鄕了。牠兩眼竟落下淚來，發出慘疼的呌聲。陳雲裳化裝蒙古式番女，領着她走過沙漠。牠（指駱駝）更加傷感。和陳小姐喂倚不捨，見者都說她在發思鄕病，是一頭多情的駱駝。</p>
<p>古裝片想賺外滙</p>
<p>夏歷新年間公映的古裝國貨片據說都很偉大當麗，大槪製片公司都不自菲薄吧，所以像藝華的「楚覇王」，華成的「木蘭從軍」，都破例地在本埠西文報上大登廣告，大槪是想拉點外國觀衆，好賣點外國拷貝吧！如能成爲事實，則可多少發點洋財，增加中國的外滙資金，不能說不是推銷國貨的好方法。但國華公司的「孟姜女』不想外滙，閉關自守，爲什麼要那麽客氣呢？</p>
<p>「武則天」打進大上海</p>
<p>佈景大王方沛霖加入新華後的第一部古裝巨片「武則天」成績優美，允其是佈景富麗偉大，不讓洋貨影片。大上海戲院素以專映美國片爲號召，但一見該片成績十分滿意，已取得該片在滬的初映權。該片已定農歷元宵節正式公映。這一砲必定可以打得響的。也可算是國片的榮光呢。</p>

<p>伶人對於吃喝嫖賭及玩弄鳥獸蟲魚等的嗜好</p>
<p>北　平有些窮人家的孩童，也日夜捕捉，大批的賣給有錢收買的人家。所以像叔岩等，一養就是幾桌，大槪一張八仙桌上，可以擺放着幾十個砂罐，每一罐內，置播　一二隻不等，並目罐上置罐，的有三四層或五六層，因此每二張桌上就有蟋蟀百數十隻之多。有些大府邸的闊少爺，每遇到同好的人就問「你府上今年養幾桌？」其實一桌的代價，就很可觀啦；何况是養個三桌五桌呢？有一年我在榮稚峯府中的西花廳裹，看到叔岩同一位無錫人姓楊的大鬥一番，這位楊君是平津養蟋蚌的大王，他家裏本來就很富足，而他每年在這上頭還可以　個一萬兩萬，所以他家養的蟋蟀比誰都多都好，平日專雇着幾個人管理這事，每逢同人家比賽的日期，先命人挑着担兒，揀上好的擺在盒担裏三二十罐，及至到了的定的地點，將罐兒取出，放在天井裏的桌案上，罐蓋揭去後，用極細緻的竹簾子蓋在上面，讓這些小蟲兒矖矖太陽。未咬之前，先把每個的分最秤了一秤，註明一錢或是八分九分，一錢多甚至二錢重的也有，不過身個太大的反倒不如短小精悍的來得兇猛耐久，故而雙方鬥交的時候，總是以一錢上下的蟲兒爲多，一錢同一錢的咬，九分同九分的鬥，兩方的分量是决不能懸殊一點的，所以掌天秤的這人，非心地公正不可，叔岩同楊某交了幾陣，總是　給他的多，後來花了拾塊錢買了一隻蟲兒，也曾交敗了不少的勁敵，他心中非常得意，過幾日又的在榮宅决鬥，這决睹的輸贏，比歷來都大，起先還能咬個平手，等到後來仍是改在人家手裏，輸了錢不算，但是面子上太不好瞧啦，所以他從此以後，就氣得不再玩啦。</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to reports here, the Japanese Navy Ministry announced last night that it had decided to turn Hainan Island, which was recently occupied, into a naval and air force base. Yulin Port on the south coast of the island will be converted into a naval port to protect Japan's transportation to and from the South Sea Islands. The outer docks can accommodate 10,000-ton warships, and the inner port can accommodate 3,000-ton battleships. A large airfield will be built in a certain area on the north coast as a base for air raids on South China. Previously, when Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with the British and French ambassadors, he guaranteed that the occupation of Hainan Island had no military intentions. (February 16th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Japanese Foreign Ministry's guarantee to the British and French ambassadors that the occupation of Hainan Island had no territorial intentions, the "Asahi Shimbun," the most influential newspaper in Tokyo, published a special article vehemently criticizing the Foreign Ministry. The newspaper stated that since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the Foreign Ministry had repeatedly used such official guarantees to cover up Japan's territorial ambitions. In fact, such guarantees are completely superfluous. (February 16th, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Xuwen: The two brigades of Japanese troops invading Hainan Island are composed of a mixed force from the Taiwan Army and the Naval Landing Force, with Lieutenant General Kondo Nobutoki as the overall commander. Currently, Japanese and Chinese troops are still engaged in mixed combat in the Dongshui Chengmai Xincheng Jinjiang area. (February 16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to military news received here, after withdrawing from several coastal cities, the Chinese army on Hainan Island is now defending new positions at the foot of the Five Finger Mountains. These mountains stretch across the island from northwest to southeast. The fighting in the northeast corner of the island is currently taking place in Tianhuatang (transliteration) in the southeast of Qiongzhou. The Japanese troops advancing south from Chengmai are currently engaging the Chinese army in Jinjiang and Ruiwan (both transliterations). According to informed sources here, it is doubtful whether the Japanese army can penetrate deep into the interior of Hainan Island, as the interior is mostly mountainous and can provide support for guerrillas. (February 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to Chinese sources here, the Japanese troops invading south from Qiongzhou have not made much progress due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army. Ding'an and Wenchang are still in the hands of the Chinese army. The city of Jinjiang southwest of Chengmai is still under battle. The Chinese artillery unit at Hainan Mouth east of Haikou is currently engaged in fierce artillery battles with Japanese warships. The Japanese troops have repeatedly attempted to land near Hainan Mouth, but have not succeeded due to the heavy Chinese artillery fire. (February 16th, Express News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources outside Guangzhou Bay, when Japanese troops landed at Sanya Bay near Yulin Port in southern Hainan Island on the 14th of this month, the Chinese army on the shore resisted fiercely. However, the Japanese army dispatched large squadrons of aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the area, and a large fire broke out throughout Sanya Town. The Chinese army withdrew from the town to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. After landing, the Japanese troops advanced in two routes, one towards Lingshui Bay and the other west towards Yaxian. It is reported that the Japanese troops on the former route have been wiped out by the Chinese army northeast of Yulin Port. Although the Japanese troops on the latter route have made some progress, they have also paid a heavy price. Currently, fierce fighting is still taking place near Yulin Port and Yaxian. (February 16th, Express News Agency)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military news received here today, after inflicting considerable casualties on the Japanese army, the Chinese army in Yaxian and Yulin Port in southern Hainan Island have retreated to the mountainous areas outside these cities to continue the war. Anding, 30 miles south of Qiongzhou, fell yesterday. The Chinese army is currently setting up new positions in the southwestern suburbs of the area. The battle in Wenchang is fierce, and Wenchang is still in the hands of the Chinese army. (February 16th, Express News Agency) The State Council received a notification today stating that American and foreign nationals on Hainan Island are safe and sound. According to this report, it was notified by the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou to the American Consul General in Guangzhou, Mayer, who then relayed it to his country. (February 15th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Melbourne: According to Dr. Bennet, Professor of International Affairs at Burlington University, "Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is a sign of Japan's southward advance, but at present there is no intention to advance further south and covet Australia." "Chiang Kai-shek's words are certainly pleasing to the ear in order to attract the attention of Britain and France, but Japan will definitely deny it." Regarding the independence of the Philippines, he said that it may be delayed from now on, because allowing the Philippines to become independent in 1946 is, in fact, tantamount to handing the Philippines over to Japan. (February 15th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources outside Guangzhou Bay, the situation on the Leizhou Peninsula is currently very tense, as the Japanese army intends to land on the southern part of the island at any time. It was rumored last night that a small Japanese team had landed on the beach seven miles east of Xuwen, opposite Haikou, but this has not been confirmed. (February 16th, Express News Agency)</p>

The rest either caught fire or were damaged, and the gasoline depot at the airfield was hit, causing a fire. Japanese aircraft bombed the outskirts of Xi'an on Sunday, but the Chinese airfield there was not damaged. (February 15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: On the 31st of last month, seven Chinese aircraft flew to bomb Xinxian Station, which belongs to Huo County. At 3 p.m., three Chinese bombers again flew to the Japanese garrison in Huo County and dropped many bombs, all of which hit their targets. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters, who stated today at a reception for guests at the China Branch of the International Peace Conference, "China will definitely achieve final victory within two years, at most three years." According to Chen Cheng, one of China's new military figures, based on his observations of the Japanese side's strategic errors, diplomatic isolation, and economic difficulties, China only needs to prolong the war and deepen Japan's difficulties, and it will be able to quickly achieve final victory. Chen also stated that "China's only way out is to continue the war of resistance and absolutely not talk about peace recklessly." There were 400 people present at the meeting, including many foreign guests and foreign journalists. Various slogans were hung in the reception room, such as "Down with the Aggressors" and the slogans displayed by the London General Assembly, "End the War in China" and "Boycott Japanese Goods," all of which were hung high on the walls.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign journalists who have just arrived in Hong Kong from Qingdao, the tax revenue in Qingdao City has always been in the hands of the Japanese Navy. On the 2nd of this month, the Army demanded several million from the Navy authorities, and the Navy refused. The Army authorities then dispatched a large number of troops to surround the Navy Headquarters. The Navy opened fire in resistance, creating an amusing scene of a major conflict between the Navy and the Army. The situation was very serious. Later, the Japanese Consul General and the consuls of various countries stationed in Qingdao mediated, and after telegrams of reprimand from the Tokyo Naval and Army authorities, the conflict was quelled. However, casualties on both sides exceeded 1,000. (February 16th dispatch)</p>

<p>Zhongxiang: The war situation in central Hubei has been in a state of tension for the past week. Japanese and Chinese forces are still facing off in their original positions. The Japanese army has recently been forcibly conscripting laborers in central Hubei to rush repairs on the highways of Yunmeng, Anlu, Yingcheng, Zaoshi, and Jingshan, and is strengthening the defensive fortifications of various strongholds in eastern Hubei. Japanese aircraft are constantly flying over Chinese positions to scout. The Japanese army in Yueyang also seems to be preparing to cross north and peek west. (February 16th dispatch)</p>

Unexpectedly, the wind direction changed suddenly, and the poisonous gas blew back towards the Japanese positions, resulting in more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers being poisoned and killed. Currently, Japanese Officer Yamamoto Otsuzo has ordered the urgent dispatch of 150,000 gas masks for front-line use. (February 16th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Rewarding and Punishing in Guerrilla Areas <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Four days ago, it was reported that inland areas were ordered to universally establish monuments to fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance. Yesterday, a telegram from Hong Kong stated that the Military Affairs Commission ordered that all those who participate in puppet organizations in various places, except those who are truly coerced and willing to turn over a new leaf and repent, should be granted amnesty. However, if there are national traitors who are still stubbornly unrepentant, or who are involved in puppet regimes, or who are secretly acting as traitors, they should be strictly arrested and punished in accordance with the regulations for punishing traitors, in order to uphold the law and discipline. These two things, one to honor loyalty and the other to warn against evil, have the same meaning. The vigor of morale and popular sentiment has its own source. In times of foreign aggression, morale and popular sentiment are often based on innate blood ties, and are further enlightened by peacetime education, so that understanding becomes more genuine and development becomes greater. However, in order to make it universal and deep-rooted, and to effectively dominate the minds and actions of the general public, it is even more necessary for the state to have laws and decrees for rewards and punishments, and for society to have a system of praise and criticism. This is because only in this way can the retribution of merit, demerit, honor, and disgrace to these people be clearly seen, and the distinction between loyalty and evil cannot be faked. This is the most effective and far-reaching way to cultivate morale and popular sentiment, and it is almost ten to a hundred times more effective than education.</p>
<p>China is currently in the midst of the War of Resistance, and the state of national politics and society is very different from peacetime, each with its own characteristics of an extraordinary period. In the rear, the front line, and the guerrilla warfare areas, there are almost three separate worlds. The guerrilla warfare areas are the most changeable and the most memorable. Among them, there are countless stories of noble-minded people, virtuous women, and martyrs with pure hearts and boiling blood, acting in various moving and tragic ways. Secondly, there are countless ordinary men and women who remain loyal but cannot escape death or find a proper burial place, who live in seclusion, eking out a living, and listening only to the evening hoping for the return of daylight. As for those who are depraved, servile, rely on power to bully others, act like tyrants, oppress the good and weak, and poison the countryside, these are also common, and they do not necessarily have to be nominally in a puppet position. No good deeds are rewarded, and no evil deeds can be punished. If there is no reward, there is no way to encourage good; if there is no punishment, there is no way to deter evil. If China were to recover lost territories early, then it would be fine, but if time passes, then those struggling to survive in the dark countryside will inevitably lead to the elimination of the good and weak, and everyone will compete to be tigers and wolves. Therefore, we believe that in addition to the universal construction of monuments to fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance, it is still necessary to use various different forms and methods in the guerrilla warfare areas to encourage the virtuous and commend the loyal and righteous. The central government should clearly advocate this from above, and assign the political training work and administrative personnel in the guerrilla warfare areas to earnestly implement it from below. The enlightened people who remain in the guerrilla warfare areas also have an unshirkable responsibility to the virtuous, loyal, and righteous people in their villages.</p>
<p>As for punishing evil, it should not be limited to puppets and traitors. The regulations for punishing traitors are already unforgivable. In addition, it is still necessary to enact several chapters of law, specifically targeting the crimes in the guerrilla warfare areas, and issue edicts to both inside and outside. Those who have fallen into the guerrilla warfare areas are still Chinese people, and they cannot be regarded as uncivilized or ignored. Being able to prevent a fraction of crime is enough to preserve a fraction of purity. Moreover, under abnormal circumstances, there are things that are not considered crimes by the laws of peacetime, but during this period and in this situation, their hearts are punishable and their actions are inexcusable. There are things that are permitted and protected by the laws of peacetime, but during this period and in this situation, they often become a medium and basis for crime. If the Chinese government issues strict prohibitions from afar, then although the national strength and laws may not be able to reach them at present, it cannot be immediately expected to stop evil. However, as the news spreads, the people in the guerrilla warfare areas will have a new standard of right and wrong, understand the advantages and disadvantages, and know what to follow and what to avoid. These things are not to seek the safety of the people in the guerrilla warfare areas who have fallen into enemy hands. It is important to know that they are living in dire straits, half of which is due to the evil acts of fellow countrymen acting as henchmen. If the Chinese government formulates special laws against crime, making right and wrong clear under remote prohibition, then by reducing some henchmen or reducing some evil acts, the people in the guerrilla warfare areas will be able to alleviate their suffering, and those who forcibly occupy this land will also reduce their opportunities for exploitation and reduce the effectiveness of their nets. Therefore, even from the current point of view, it is a beneficial measure. Furthermore, after the war, the new standard of right and wrong will be in place. Whether the punishment is decided in a formal court, or by a popular tribunal, or is not covered by the law and is left to social sanctions, those who poison their compatriots will surely reap their rewards. This will not only uphold justice, but also build the foundation of the nation.</p>

<p>(Paris) The right-wing "Figaro" recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in London, stating that the French government had recently proposed to the British government that the staff departments of both sides should hold talks to discuss further cooperation methods. The British government is said to have accepted this proposal and agreed to discuss military cooperation plans as soon as possible, especially in the Far East and the Mediterranean. (February 16th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) France has suggested to Britain that talks should be held immediately on adjusting the defense plans of the two countries in the Far East, Near East and the Mediterranean. Diplomatic circles here believe that this suggestion is a direct reaction to the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island, because the occupation of Hainan Island is enough to threaten French Indochina, and Italy's demands on France are enough to lead Europe into another crisis. French officials apparently took this action after hearing reports that Japan had set up defenses on Hainan Island. In addition, Japan's failure to guarantee to France that it would withdraw its troops from the island soon has further strengthened France's determination to cooperate with Britain in defending the Far East. If the negotiations between Britain and France are successful, then the United States may be invited to join the cooperation. Well-informed sources believe that it is undoubtedly true that Britain and France will jointly defend the Far East, Near East and the Mediterranean. Furthermore, British and French military personnel are very satisfied after hearing reports that Washington is preparing to expand cooperation with Latin American countries to jointly resist foreign aggression, because they believe that this move is another sign of democratic countries strengthening their ties, which can be used to strive for a balanced position in the world.

<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, China and Spain were equally concerned by the members. The events discussed were as follows: (1) The suggestion to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911; (2) The proposal to send a warship to Hainan, or even to land British troops; (3) The question of whether the government will provide financial assistance to the National Relief Commission of the Chinese government; (4) The proposal to establish a gunboat passenger transport service between Shanghai and Hankou; (5) Japan's discrimination against all countries and exclusive preferential treatment of Germany; (6) The status of British shipping, especially the status of Qingdao. (February 15th, Reuters) First, Conservative MP Graham asked about the Japanese military's occupation of Hainan Island. Undersecretary of State Butler immediately replied that the British and French governments, "want to maintain the common interests held by both sides in the Chinese Sea in the most appropriate way, and are maintaining close contact." Conservative MP Milner then raised three questions: (1) Was Britain notified before the Japanese military landed on Hainan Island? (2) Was France notified? (3) Has the Japanese government indicated how long it will occupy the island? Butler gave a negative answer to the first and second questions. Regarding the third question, he said, "The Japanese government has stated that it has no territorial ambitions, and the length of its occupation of the island will be determined by military needs." Milner then asked, "Has the US government sent a warship to Hainan Island?" Butler replied, "I am afraid I cannot answer." Graham then asked, "The Japanese naval authorities' encroachment on Far Eastern commerce is becoming more and more common. Is Prime Minister Chamberlain prepared to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911?" Butler replied, "The British government is constantly studying various methods that can maintain Britain's interests in the Far East." Graham then said, "Repeated protests in the past have been ineffective. The only weapon that can achieve satisfactory results is retaliation. Is this not obvious to the government?" Butler replied, "I do not believe that this is the only way to achieve satisfactory results." (February 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>Labour MP Tomlinson asked whether the government intends to provide financial assistance to the National Relief Commission of the Chinese government, which has recently been reported to have achieved remarkable results. Butler replied that the government has assisted in handling the League of Nations' epidemic prevention work in China through its contribution to the League of Nations. Milner then asked, noting the current situation of passenger traffic between Hankou and Shanghai, saying that only Japanese ships can operate, and very few British nationals are allowed to travel, while German nationals have no difficulty in traveling. What action does the government intend to take regarding this matter? Is it intended to transport passengers by gunboat as in the Pearl River, or use merchant ships flying a white flag? Butler replied that he was aware of the difficult situation described by Milner, but according to the information he had received, there was no preferential treatment for Germans. He stated that he had made a statement on February 6 and that the government had raised questions with the Japanese government again on January 14. The suggestions made by Milner, along with other suggestions, are now under consideration by the government. Graham asked whether the Japanese authorities have now allowed British ships to freely sail to Qingdao Port. Butler replied, "Not yet." The government has recently continued to negotiate with the Japanese government on this matter. The British Consul General in Qingdao and local British naval personnel are continuing to urge the Japanese authorities to reopen the port. Butler also replied to a question from Thornton of the National Conservative Party, saying that the information he had received did not mention any confiscation of cargo ships in any Chinese port occupied by the Japanese army. However, the inconvenience of British ships transporting goods to the lighter ships in Qingdao and Yantai has indeed been delayed and other difficulties have been encountered. British authorities have been negotiating with the Japanese authorities in both local and Tokyo. Then, Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied to a question about labor organizations in Hong Kong, saying that trade unions are allowed to work freely there. There were about eight industrial disputes last year, all of which were resolved peacefully through mediation by the Chinese Affairs Department. All good trade unions are not prohibited. However, some associations and federations that call themselves trade unions have been deemed illegal by the authorities from time to time, mostly because they engage in terrorist and political activities. One of the most recent was banned more than a year ago. (February 15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies discussed the situation created by the Japanese military's occupation of Hainan Island this afternoon. Chairman Mistraloff gave a speech, stating that this move could have a major impact on military strategy. Hainan Island is located at the intersection of the spheres of influence of Britain, France, and the United States, and the countries must take joint action diplomatically. From a legal point of view, China and France exchanged documents in 1897, stipulating that China must not cede the island to a third country. France and Japan also signed an agreement in 1907, agreeing not to take any actions that would be detrimental to the other party. It can be seen that the Japanese military's landing on the island has no legal justification. Finally, Mistraloff commented on the results recently obtained by the British and French governments in their negotiations with Japan. The committee then submitted it for discussion and decided to invite Foreign Minister Ponle to attend a report in a short period of time. In addition, the Naval Committee of the Chamber of Deputies will also submit the issue of Hainan Island's connection with French maritime security for discussion and decided to invite Marine Chief Kang Bingji to attend a report.

<p>(Berlin) According to the German government organ, President Roosevelt clearly intends to create his "hegemony in the Pacific." The newspaper, named "Armed Forces," is the organ of the German Army and is published weekly. It published two articles attacking the United States for threatening Japan's position in the Far East. One was written by Dr. Chou Gela, and the other was written by Asendorf. Chou Gela's article, entitled "The American Offensive," claims that the American Philippines is no different from a threat to Japan's vital interests, and President Roosevelt seems determined to use the Philippines as a base to restrain Japan's leap forward. If the United States retains the Philippines, the United States' power can reach the Far East directly via Hawaii, giving the United States a base for attacking Japan. As for Asendorf's article, it is accompanied by a map showing the United States' bases in the Pacific. The depiction of the defenses of Pearl Harbor is quite detailed. Asendorf claims that those who talk about the United States' Pacific bases all recognize Pearl Harbor as the iron fist of the United States in the Pacific and as a weapon for attacking Japan. The United States can directly attack Japan from Pearl Harbor and can also support the Philippines in attacking Japan. However, it is impossible for Japan to dispatch a strong navy and 100,000 troops to attack Hawaii and the United States' coast. At the same time, the United States seems to have no intention of granting independence to the Philippines and is unwilling to proceed. The most obvious thing is that the Philippine army currently trained by Americans is no different from an outer line supply station for the United States Army. The Philippines is located between Japan's armpit and ribs, and is closely related to Japan's security in both political and economic terms. Now Roosevelt's policy coincides with Stalin's policy, and they both want to use this as a base to oppose Japan and communism in the Far East. From this point of view, Stalin and Roosevelt, communism and democratic politics, are all birds of a feather. In world politics, there is no difference between the two.

<h3 id="e30">Britain's Huge Defense Budget, Implementation of Five-Year Plan, Total of 1.1 Billion Pounds for First Three Years, Actively Expanding Strength of Army, Navy, and Air Force <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to the defense white paper released today, the defense budget for 1939-40 totals 523 million pounds, the defense expenditure for 1937-38 was 262 million pounds, and the expenditure for 1938-39 (ending March 31) is estimated to require 388 million pounds. Therefore, within the five-year period in which Parliament passed the borrowing of 400 million pounds for defense expenditure, the total expenditure for the first three years is 1.173 billion pounds. The above figures only refer to the expenditure of the army, navy, and air force, and the additional civilian defense expenditure is not included. If this civilian defense expenditure is calculated together, the total expenditure for 1939-40 will require approximately 580 million pounds. The white paper also states that the preliminary stage of the five-year defense program has now been completed, the difficulties in production have been overcome, and future plans will depend on the world situation.</p>
<p>The white paper proposes adding two more battleships to the 1939 program, so there will be a total of nine under construction. The 1939 program stipulates the construction of two new destroyer squadrons, twenty new-style fast escort ships to protect various ships from submarine and air attacks, and one aircraft carrier. In addition to the "Royal Ark" which has now been completed, there are a total of six under construction. In addition, there are four large cruisers equipped with six-inch gun positions and several small warships. The renovation of existing old ships is currently underway, and the air defense equipment of other ships has also been greatly enhanced. The equipment of the army has made great progress.</p>
<p>The air force budget for 1939 will exceed 200 million pounds. The monthly aircraft production rate will double in the current fiscal year, and the number of first-line aircraft will reach the original target of 1,750 by the end of March. In 1939, the Royal Air Force will continue to expand in accordance with the declaration of May 1938 in order to reach the target of 2,370 first-line aircraft in the home defense area and 500 overseas. At the same time, the Fleet Air Arm will also complete its objectives in accordance with the continued expansion measures announced on November 10, 1938.</p>
<p>The white paper also explains that one factor in the increase in defense expenditure is the genius of inventors in creating new products, which makes modern military equipment increasingly complex. However, the main reason is that adequate preparation must be made to resist air raids. Most of the huge air force expenditure is due to the manufacture of a large number of modern aircraft, and huge expenditure is still required to increase manufacturing capacity and build thirty-seven new airfields. The air defense aspect has also been greatly strengthened, especially new anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. Civilian defense also requires extremely huge expenditure. The tonnage of naval shipbuilding increased from 139,000 tons in 1935 to 660,000 tons this year. Steps have now been taken to establish the manufacturing capacity of the various autonomous territories. Therefore, large bombers and fighter planes have been ordered from Canada, and a committee is currently in Australia, traveling to New Zealand, to take similar action. In addition, ordinary reconnaissance and training aircraft have been ordered in the United States. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons today that the government's power to borrow defense funds will be doubled from 400 million pounds to 800 million pounds. The effect of this new power is that only 600 million pounds can be borrowed from now until March 31, 1942, because 200 million pounds has already been borrowed. The 1937 Defense Loan Act authorized the government to borrow 400 million pounds during the five-year period from 1937 to 1942 under the program of rearmament. However, when this case was presented, it was explained that 400 million pounds was not the final limit, and if the situation required it, Parliament would be asked to grant the power to continue borrowing. Therefore, a resolution on a method was specifically proposed today, thereby forming a draft bill to double the amount borrowed during the five-year period until 1942, making the total amount reach 800 million pounds. Simon continued that the cost of rearmament to date totals less than 200 million pounds, so the new bill will stipulate the continued borrowing of approximately 600 million pounds. The content of this bill will be the same as the 1937 Defense Loan Act, but he proposed including the expenditure on civilian defense and the purchase of food and other major goods in the use of this loan. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British government's white paper also revealed important figures on the army and air force as follows: "Increase in Naval Tonnage" On January 1, 1935, a total of 139,330 tons of warships were under construction. On January 1, 1936, a total of 291,900 tons of warships were under construction. On January 1, 1937, there were a total of 375,700 tons of warships. On January 1, 1938, there were a total of 547,000 tons of warships. On March 1, 1939, there will be 659,000 tons of warships. "Naval Officers and Soldiers" In 1922-23, there were only 89,000 people, which has increased to 119,000 people in 1938. "Air Force Personnel" The recruitment of Air Force personnel has continued since 1918. There are currently 31,000 Air Force officers, including 1,700 pilots. "Air Raid Shelters" will be completed by March 1 of this year and will be able to accommodate 10 million people. 16th Huitong dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Arita entered the palace this morning to report to the Emperor on the details of the stalemate in the negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding Japan's right to fish in the Soviet Union's territorial waters in the northern Pacific. Arita also briefly presented the steps decided by the Japanese government to the Emperor. Arita then instructed the Japanese Ambassador to Moscow to explain to the Soviet government that if the Soviet Union still refuses to reconsider its attitude, the diplomatic negotiations have obviously failed, and "Japan will have to use straightforward and appropriate methods to break this situation." Because the fishing season is approaching and the fishing area will also be auctioned in Vladivostok on March 15, the army, navy, and foreign ministries have been discussing plans in recent days and decided that if the Soviet Union does not reconsider its attitude, Japanese fishing in Soviet territorial waters will be unavoidable.

Republican Representative Andrews proposed an amendment suggesting that the army purchase a maximum of 1,000 aircraft per year, rather than ordering over 3,000 at once. Some Republican representatives echoed this sentiment, citing technical reasons and arguing that the United States was not under threat of air attack from other countries. However, Chairman May of the House Military Affairs Committee and Democratic leader Rayburn opposed the amendment. Rayburn stated that the United States had previously entered the European war unprepared, and he did not want to repeat that mistake. In any case, it is necessary to be prepared to safeguard the nation's security, rights, and freedom. The current situation in Europe is like a volcano, ready to erupt, and the danger is greater than in 1914. For the sake of our country, preparedness is key. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee recently passed a bill authorizing $68.4 million to strengthen naval air bases in the Alaskan Peninsula, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific. Republican Representative Hess proposed a motion to explicitly state that no bases of any kind would be established on Guam, but the Naval Affairs Committee rejected it by a vote of 14 to 5. This motion sparked a heated debate. Rear Admiral Cooke, Chief of Naval Aviation, attended and explained that Guam's location was extremely important to the U.S. Navy and that the proposed construction was not of a provocative nature. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States is currently building over one hundred warships. According to the Navy Department today, it is still necessary to build two cruisers of over 6,000 tons. Bethlehem Steel Corporation of Massachusetts quoted a price of $11,695,000 per ship, while the government shipbuilding company quoted $15,950,000 per ship. According to the contract, the two ships should be completed in 32 to 38 months. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the government's military expansion bill was passed by the House of Representatives, political figures generally stated that President Roosevelt's general policies had gained support. Regarding the United States selling aircraft to Britain and France, most members of Congress have acknowledged that assisting Britain and France in expanding their military is, in fact, safeguarding the security of the United States. For example, Republican Representative Pease, though an opposition member, stated, "I am convinced that President Roosevelt did not say that the American border is on the Rhine, but I believe the President can issue a statement saying that our country's first line of defense is in Britain and France. If those countries are defeated, then our country will be threatened." Assuming war breaks out in Europe and Germany wins, the British Bermudas (not far from the American coast) may be ceded to Germany, and the United States will inevitably face a serious military threat.

<p>American Press Observations:</p>
<p>International Situation:</p>
<p>Japan's Excessive Losses Prevent Attack on Soviet Union</p>
<p>(New York) Today, the New York World-Telegram prominently published an article by Sims, foreign news editor of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. The article pointed out that "Germany and Italy will take action within four to six weeks, but the Sino-Japanese War may hinder this plan. It is said that the points of initiation are: Italy in the Mediterranean area, Germany in central and eastern Europe, and Japan in eastern Siberia. Hitler will use the same tactics against Hungary and Romania as he did against Czechoslovakia. At the same time, Japan will threaten the Siberian coastal area and the Siberian Railway, and Italy will make demands on France." Sims stated that while he could not fully guarantee the accuracy of this report, it was definitely sent by Nazi party members to their respective trade relations. Sims added, "In their eyes, Germany, Italy, and Japan may not have fully decided to take this action, as Germany will not strike first until Japan attacks the Soviet Union. However, Japan has suffered excessive losses in China and is unable to attack the Soviet Union." According to the source of the report, "This plan is close to exaggeration and will inevitably be delayed. Germany and Japan anticipate that they can defeat the Soviet Union within six months after the start of the war, thereby incorporating eastern Europe completely into Germany, while Japan becomes the leader of the western Pacific and the Far East." (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>U.S. Neutrality Act Amendment to be Introduced for Discussion in Congress</p>
<p>(Washington) The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Senator Thomas, a Democrat from Utah, will soon be introduced for discussion. Political figures are paying close attention to it. According to this amendment, if any country violates international treaties signed by the United States and attacks another country, the President, with the consent of Congress, may determine that it is an aggressor nation and prohibit the shipment of arms and raw materials to that country. All countries in the world, including the United States, are signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which applies in practice, making this amendment highly significant. Although this bill does not fully meet the government's wishes, the situation will become clearer when the Neutrality Act amendment is discussed in the future. The State Department is also pleased to see the evolution of diplomatic views among members of Congress. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Germany Seeks Trade Development with Soviet Union; Head of East European Department to Visit Moscow Next Month</p>
<p>(Moscow) Dr. Schnurre, head of the East European Department of the Trade Division of the German Foreign Ministry, is scheduled to arrive here around March 10 to discuss the development of bilateral trade with Soviet government officials. Local authorities claim that Germany may supply the Soviet Union with armaments. It is reported that Schnurre recently arrived in Warsaw, preparing to come here, but suddenly postponed his trip and returned directly to Germany. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Hemispheric Defense Plan to be Gradually Implemented</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources in the Army and Navy Departments today, President Roosevelt's vision of "defending the Western Hemisphere" against foreign aggression has been realized. The two departments stated that they would send military and naval missions to various Latin American republics to expand military cooperation with those countries. The State Department has long prepared plans for expanding military and naval cooperation with Western Hemisphere powers. The detailed contents of this plan were largely decided at the Pan-American Conference in Lima last December. U.S. Army and Navy experts will assist Latin America in training and organizing their defense forces and will serve as senior military advisors to South and Central American countries. Government officials stated that although the details of the joint defense plan for the Western Hemisphere have not yet been finalized, South American countries have accepted U.S. Army and Navy advisors in accordance with the agreement, so the main steps to achieve this goal have been successful. More practical steps may develop after the upcoming U.S. naval review in the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The results of the review will test the defenses of the Panama Canal and other important Western Hemisphere locations, informing Latin American countries so they can draft defense plans in cooperation with the United States. Observers here believe that the support for the U.S. Western Hemisphere joint defense plan is more significant than what was formally declared in Lima. The U.S. naval mission currently has seven officers in Brazil, three in Argentina, four in Peru, and one in Colombia. The U.S. Army has military advisors in Brazil, Colombia, and Haiti. Argentina also has an air force mission. It is expected that the missions of the Army and Navy will expand to South America in the near future, especially to Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, and Peru. The recent visit of Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha to consult with senior State Department officials also attracted attention. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar's Defenses Strengthened</p>
<p>(London) Sir Harrington, the former Governor of Gibraltar, whose five-year term expired last October, made a startling statement today at the Royal Empire Society. He said that Gibraltar was unprepared during the European crisis last September, with only four anti-aircraft guns on either end of the Rock. At the time, France had a large army gathered on the border of Spanish Morocco, seemingly planning to occupy Ceuta and Tetouan. According to his information, Franco intended to remain neutral, and Hitler had given his permission, but stated that Spanish airfields would be used by his bombers. Therefore, if France seized Ceuta, Hitler would retaliate, and Gibraltar would be a natural target. At the time, there were only four anti-aircraft guns. It is reported that the situation there is very different now. (Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Germany Actively Preparing for War; Dredging the Wilhelm Canal; Connecting the North Sea and the Baltic Sea; Another Step in Anti-British Policy <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Ministry of Transport announced yesterday that work will begin on widening the Wilhelm Canal, which connects the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, to allow passage for larger ships and improve navigation. The canal was originally opened from 1887 to 1895, and subsequently deepened from 1907 to 1914. Two locks, 330 meters long, 45 meters wide, and 14 meters deep, were added in Holtenau-Brunsbüttelkoog, which were among the largest locks in the world at the time. The old locks are no longer suitable and need to be rebuilt, with a project even larger than before. The bridges along the canal also need to be rebuilt, and the riverbed in the lower Elbe section needs to be deepened. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) After the news came that the German authorities were planning to widen the "Wilhelm Canal," also known as the Kiel Canal, naval circles here were extremely concerned. They said that this was another step in the country's anti-British policy. Currently, the country is engaged in a commercial war with Britain in the global market in the economic field. In the naval field, it is demanding to increase the tonnage of submarines to be on par with Britain, based on the Anglo-German agreement. Now, the widening of the Kiel Canal is because the country's fleet cannot freely move between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea while dealing with the British and Soviet fleets. If the country currently wants to transfer its fleet from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea, or from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea, it must go through the Great and Little Belts of Denmark. This requires prior permission from the Danish authorities before passage is allowed. If the Danish authorities place mines in these straits, the German fleet will be unable to pass. However, after the "Wilhelm Canal" is widened and deepened, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea will be connected, and the country's fleet can be freely transferred between the two seas. The survival and vital interests of Britain and the Soviet Union will also be significantly affected. (Note: The Wilhelm Canal runs from the port of Kiel on the Baltic coast to the Elbe River. The Elbe River connects to the North Sea.) (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Goering Issues New Order; Adjusting Labor Force; Concentrating National Efforts; Completing the Four-Year Plan</p>
<p>(Berlin) General Goering, the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, issued an order yesterday stipulating that German citizens and unprotected foreigners are obligated to serve in various emergency public works projects. The order stated, "During this construction period, projects related to the country's main policies must not be delayed. The lack of manpower must not hinder progress. Therefore, local authorities may conscript residents within their jurisdiction to work and must increase their work obligations." For projects that the Four-Year Economic Plan Committee considers particularly important, labor groups may also force public and private organizations and businesses to allocate workers to undertake them. In the case of these organizations and businesses, the employees should be treated as being on leave. Foreign nationals within the country who are not protected by treaties or who do not enjoy special rights conferred by international law also have the same obligation to serve. The Frankfurter Zeitung commented on this measure, saying that the goal of this order is to adjust the labor force to concentrate national efforts to complete the Four-Year Economic Plan.

<h3 id="e34">Britain Advises Both Sides of the Spanish Civil War to Make Peace Early; Recognition of Franco's Regime is Only a Matter of Time; French Senator Périer to Go to Burgos Today <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that he is currently negotiating with both sides of the Spanish military to prepare a ceasefire plan in order to seek peace. According to Chamberlain's information, Hitler told him during the Munich Conference that if other countries take the same action as Germany, then Germany will withdraw its troops from Spain. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed parliamentary sources recently stated that when Foreign Secretary Halifax met with French Ambassador Corbin this afternoon, he told him that the British Cabinet had decided in principle to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government, but left it to Prime Minister Chamberlain and himself to recognize it at the most appropriate time. The timing depends on three things: 1. How General Franco treats the people of the Republican government. 2. What is the result of French Senator Périer's second trip to Spain? 3. What kind of power does a certain country have in the Nationalist government? Regarding the first point, the Nationalist government issued an order the day before yesterday deciding to punish officials and political figures of the Republican government, and even lower-level civil servants were not spared. Britain originally hoped that the Republican government would issue an amnesty order. Upon hearing the news, it was disappointed. Sir Roger Senhouse, the British commercial representative in Burgos, has discussed this with the Nationalist government authorities, but has not yet received a reply. Regarding the second point, the French government's attitude will also change depending on the outcome of Périer's trip. If Britain is satisfied with the report Périer may submit, it will formally recognize the Nationalist government as the legitimate government within a week, or perhaps even earlier. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Right-wing Senator Périer was ordered to go to Burgos, Spain again to hold talks with the Nationalist government authorities in order to discuss relations and the resettlement of Spanish refugees. He is scheduled to depart for Spain tomorrow night at 8:50 PM with two secretaries and several other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>Palestine Conference at a Stalemate; Arab and Jewish Representatives Insist on Original Positions</p>
<p>(London) The Palestine Conference has been going on for many days and has entered an important stage. According to well-informed sources, the conference seems to have reached a stalemate, because the Arab representatives still insist on their original demands: 1. To establish an independent Arab state. 2. To abolish the Balfour Declaration of 1917. 3. To prohibit Jews from purchasing land. The Jewish representatives also insisted on their original position during talks with British government representatives last night: 1. Their right to live and prosper in Palestine is a historical right. 2. Jews have a necessary right to massively immigrate to Palestine. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Battle News from Northern Guangdong: From Hua County; Chinese Troops Launch Attacks with Repeated Successes <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Shaoguan Correspondence: The military situation in the northern part of Guangdong Province, the Beijiang area, has seen fierce fighting around Zengcheng and Conghua in the middle of last month. The stubborn Japanese troops were defeated by the Chinese army, suffering great losses in their main force. After reinforcements arrived in Zengcheng, Conghua, and Hua County over the past half month, approximately 5,000 to 6,000 men were stationed in various places, including Shengang, Zhongluotan, Zhu'gang, Taipingchang, Longkou, Xinjie, Hengtan, Xiangshan, and Longtan. Therefore, they have recently made further attempts to invade the north. Among them, the Japanese troops in Conghua launched disturbances towards the Chinese army's positions in Maxi, Wuhe, Wuyatou, and Dagangling at 11 a.m. on the 31st of last month, with three tanks leading the way, covering their infantry of over 200 men, advancing along the Shengang Highway. Upon receiving the news, the Chinese army in that area divided into three routes, left, right, and center, to counterattack. At noon, an engagement occurred near Nanshetou, which was extremely fierce. The two sides fought to a standstill until 5 p.m., with advances and retreats on both sides. In the end, the Japanese troops showed signs of being unable to withstand the attack. The Chinese army then switched from defense to offense, launching a full-scale attack on the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops finally retreated along their original route. In this battle, the Japanese troops suffered over 100 casualties, and two tanks were destroyed. On the 1st of this month, Japanese troops again attacked the Chinese army's front line in Dagangling. The Chinese army temporarily shifted its position, but both sides engaged in repeated seesaw battles, and the fighting was very fierce. By the morning of the 4th, the Chinese army had recovered Dagangling and had a certain mechanized unit stationed in the Dagangling area to reconstruct defensive fortifications. The morale of the army was greatly boosted. On the morning of the 5th, a large-scale counterattack was launched against the remnants of the Japanese troops who had retreated to Shengang. First, the mechanized unit, together with a part of Liang Shi's Wu Regiment, attacked Shengang directly, engaging the Japanese troops. Another part of the Chinese army outflanked the mianfang, attacking the Japanese troops from the side. The engagement on this line was even more intense than the one in Shengang. The Chinese army's artillery also showed great power, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese troops. At the same time, the Chinese army successively increased its forces, launching a fierce attack. The Japanese troops in mianfang retreated one after another, and the Chinese army recovered mianfang. In this battle, hundreds of Japanese troops were killed. On the Shengang front, the Chinese army pressed forward step by step. The Japanese troops of the Miyake unit, stationed there, were extremely panic-stricken due to their weak strength, and could only desperately defend their positions, waiting for reinforcements.</p>
<p>In Hua County, the main force of the Japanese troops was stationed in Caoluo Village and Fengyong. In order to facilitate their northward invasion, the Japanese troops captured Tanbu from Fengyong on the 28th of last month, planning to advance from Tanbu to Lubao. After Lubao was captured, they would connect with the Japanese troops in Sanshui, Xijiang, creating an arc shape. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese troops arrived in Tanbu, the Chinese army calmly responded and telegraphed for reinforcements. The Yu Brigade and two regiments near Tanbu arrived first and cut the Japanese troops into several sections, encircling them and defeating them. Over 500 Japanese troops who had broken into Tanbu, including over 100 cavalry and a team of artillery, suffered over 100 casualties in this battle. The remnants retreated back to Fengyong around 4 p.m. The Chinese army seized three Japanese machine guns, over 30 rifles, two cannons, and a Japanese flag, and continued to pursue the remnants of the Japanese troops in Fengyong. However, 70% of the shops in Tanbu city were destroyed, and the scene was extremely desolate. After this decisive defeat, the Japanese troops continuously increased their forces to Hua County. The Sugiyama and Fujita units also carried out large-scale construction work in Hengtan, Xinjie, Longkou, Xiaobu, and Xiangshan to prevent the Chinese army from attacking. The Fujita unit also moved about 300 men, with a team of infantry and a team of artillery, west to Shijiao, planning to make closer contact with the Japanese troops in Xinjie, Hengtan, Taipingchang, and Zhongluotan. However, the Chinese army learned that they were asking the Japanese troops in Guangzhou for reinforcements, and their front line was not very strong. Taking advantage of the situation, they concentrated their forces in a certain place and rushed to Hongheyue at night, launching a night attack on the Japanese troops in different directions. A certain battalion advanced directly towards Zhongluotan. It was late at night, and the Chinese army's actions were extremely secretive. The Japanese sentries failed to detect them. At 1 a.m. on the 6th, they advanced to the vicinity of Zhongluotan and bravely broke into the Japanese army's position. The Japanese troops were caught off guard, and their formation was in chaos. All the officers and soldiers of a certain battalion charged bravely, and the fighting was very fierce. The Japanese troops in Taihe City heard the alarm and transported over 300 Japanese soldiers with armored vehicles to reinforce them. As a result, the fighting became even more fierce. The Chinese army fought bravely and fearlessly. Company Commander Fang Zhongping led his troops into the Japanese army's headquarters, killing several Japanese troops, but made a heroic sacrifice. The fighting continued until dawn. The Chinese army killed over 100 Japanese troops. The Japanese troops were defeated and retreated in different directions. The Chinese army burned several Japanese army camps and the ferries and motorboats moored in the nearby river, as well as the bridges they had built. They also seized a large number of military equipment, food, and baggage. In addition to Company Commander Fang Zhongping, who was killed in action, Company Commander Lao Yaoming was wounded, and over 20 soldiers were wounded. On the same day, another battalion of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops in Taipingchang. Around 3 a.m., they arrived at certain villages near Taipingchang, and took advantage of the Japanese troops' unpreparedness, using machine guns and rifles to shoot at them fiercely. The Japanese troops also relied on fortifications to resist stubbornly. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese formation wavered. The Japanese troops then launched a dense bombardment of the Chinese army with artillery, non-stop throughout the night, for about 500 or 600 rounds, but mostly missed their targets. Afterwards, the Chinese army, believing that they had achieved the goal of depleting the Japanese troops, safely returned to their original defense before dawn. There were no losses in this battle.</p>
<p>According to military intelligence from Hua County, there are approximately 1,000 Japanese troops occupying Hua County city. When they first occupied Hua County, they sent a cavalry team along the railway front from Xinjie and Juntian to occupy Yinzhan'ao, attempting to attack Yuantan. The Chinese army took advantage of the terrain to set up a solid position, intercepting them. The general public also armed themselves to assist in defending the land. Therefore, the Japanese troops only advanced to the vicinity of Yinzhan'ao and were repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army, suffering heavy losses. Because the county seat was not easy to establish a foothold in, they retreated the main force to the Xinjie stronghold. Several hundred cavalrymen often appeared between Juntian and Yinzhan'ao, but they still did not dare to go deep. Therefore, until now, the two armies in that area are still holding their positions in the original location.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 15th: Fisher, the distinguished President of Oxford's New College, hosted a luncheon today. He stated that the World Student Association is assisting in the restoration of Chinese universities and specialized schools destroyed during the war. Fisher said that China's rebuilding of shattered institutions in the west and southwest demonstrates extreme heroism and determination. The British branch of the World Student Association raised £5,500 for this effort in 1938 and hopes to continue assisting with £4,000 this year. Guests included Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, Dr. Gu Ziren, Viscount Cecil, Sir Ross, Sir Hilaire (British Consul-General in Hankou), Mr. Ping Rong (poet), Mr. Omorphopolis (famous art collector), and Sir Milner (Conservative Member of Parliament). Dr. Gu delivered a speech, detailing the reconstruction work China has undertaken in the past 30 years, establishing primary schools capable of accommodating six million children, as well as 112 universities and specialized schools. Due to the destruction of universities in the war, 30,000 students have become homeless refugees, with losses reaching at least two million pounds sterling. Dr. Gu also mentioned students walking hundreds of miles to reach schools. Currently, there are 83 universities and specialized schools either being rebuilt or already completed. In Sichuan province's capital alone, 10,000 students have been accommodated. Yunnan province is also building new school centers, which is clear evidence of China's ability to cope with extreme difficulties and the unwavering determination to rebuild the nation. Viscount Cecil followed, stating that Japan's aggression against China should not be seen as an isolated event. It is merely one aspect of a determination to turn back the clock of modern progress. The rest of the world can now see this determination in various forms. China is not only fighting for itself but also fighting for the rule of law and freedom for the whole world.</p>

<p>Some may say that after the merger of university departments, the number of universities will decrease, and the quality will improve, making it difficult for general high school graduates to enter. This would inevitably make it more difficult to increase the number of highly specialized talents. Regarding this point, I believe that the way to remedy it is, on the one hand, to remove the limits on enrollment in higher education. On the other hand, specialized courses in various specialized departments should be added to universities or independent colleges, shortening the duration of study, increasing enrollment, and focusing on practical application to meet the needs of society.</p>
<p>Some may say that my proposition is idealistic and may not be feasible in reality. Because each school has its own history, and each school has its own background. It is impossible to force a merger, and it is not easy to split a merged entity. It is indeed inevitable that many difficulties will arise in merging schools. However, we educators, if we take the education of the entire Republic of China as the premise, should not stubbornly adhere to our own history or guard our own doors. Especially in this extraordinary period, the Chinese education community should work together to save human and material resources for the country's use. Recently, Northwest Associated University was formed by the merger of Peking University, Peking Normal University, and Beiyang College in Nanzheng, and Southwest Associated University was formed by the merger of Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai Universities in Kunming. In Shanghai, East China Christian Associated University was formed by the merger of Soochow, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and St. John's Universities (unfortunately, it has not yet reached the level of departmental mergers). Haven't each achieved considerable results? I hope that this type of united university can be gradually promoted and become a permanent organization.</p>
<p>6. Schools Should Be Rationally Distributed</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of universities and independent colleges nationwide, according to the Ministry of Education's statistics for 1934, there were a total of 111 registered schools above the junior college level (there are now more than this number). Among them, 20 were located in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), and 30 were located in Beijing and Shanghai. The universities in Pingjin and Shanghai account for half of the country's universities, which is more than the total number of universities in any country such as England, France, Germany, or Italy. At the same time, some inland provinces, such as Guizhou, Xikang, Rehe, Qinghai, Tibet, Mongolia, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Heilongjiang, do not even have a junior college, let alone a formal university. On the one hand, there is a surplus of universities; on the other hand, there is a shortage of universities. Such a distribution of higher education is extremely unreasonable. Because university students are concentrated in the cities of a few coastal provinces, what they see and hear is cars, roads, electric lights, radios, flush toilets, cinemas, and dance halls. The lives of the people in the inland provinces—wearing rags, living in thatched huts, eating tree bark and grass roots, illiterate, and emaciated—they cannot see. As for the soil, climate, water conservancy, geology, insects, plants, and treasures of the inland provinces, they cannot thoroughly understand them. Therefore, talents cultivated in commercial ports often cannot be used in rural areas, and talents cultivated in Mongolia and Xinjiang often cannot be used in Shanghai and Beijing. The achievements of higher education in China in the past few decades can be said to have prospered the cities of a few coastal provinces and abandoned the desolate and dying countryside. If we try to walk from Shanghai to the northwest, it is as if we have embarked on a historical timeline, running from the modern 20th century all the way to the primitive society of ancient times. This can also be said to be the result of an unreasonable distribution of education. To correct this unhealthy state, I hope that the education administrative authorities, in this extraordinary period, when universities cannot be secure in their original locations, should promptly promote the relocation of higher education inland. In the short term, they should reach the minimum standard of one university per province, depending on the number of middle schools in each province. Then, they should consider the specific circumstances of each location and add various specialized schools to develop their production and lead their people. In this way, we can achieve the goal of making the most of the land and not wasting any talent. Recently, the German government moved some of its universities to the border areas of Alsace-Lorraine to fulfill its ambition to develop the border regions. This shows the importance of the location of higher education. Therefore, if we want to develop the northwest, we should quickly add universities in the northwest. If we want to defend the border provinces, we should quickly add universities in the border provinces. Otherwise, thousands of miles of fertile land will be lost without us even realizing it. Whose responsibility is this? This is our education's responsibility.</p>
<p>In the history of the Republic of China's education, there was a reform after the Anglo-French allied forces in 1862, another reform after the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, and another reform after the Boxer Rebellion in 1901. Every time there was a national crisis, there was a reform. These three reforms cannot be said to be unimportant in the history of education. However, they were still superficial changes and did not produce significant results. We see that although the number of college and middle school students nationwide has increased significantly in the past few years, there has been no significant progress in quality. In particular, the 80% illiteracy rate still ranks first in the world, which can be said to be a disgrace to the Chinese education community. China's current politics and society will undergo epoch-making changes after such a serious national crisis. It is hoped that the education authorities can severely criticize the past and make thorough reforms. On the one hand, they should strive to improve the quality of higher education. On the other hand, they should make efforts to promote mass literacy education, hygiene education, and production education, catching up as soon as possible. They must ensure that everyone has food to eat and everyone is literate. Only then will the mission of China's new education in the 20th century be completed. The above points are just my personal feelings about the current state of higher education. Whether they are appropriate is up to the National Education Conference to decide. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e38">Football Friendly Match: Lido Defeats British Navy by a Landslide of 8-0, 4-0 at Halftime; Xu Wenkui's Performance Was the Most Energetic <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>To prepare for winning the Scott Cup Championship and to test the skills of the famous North China players Tan Fuzhen and Zhang Xueyao, who recently arrived in Shanghai, the Lido football team played a friendly match against the British Navy's HMS Mantis at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon at 3 pm. 2,000 spectators attended. The entire match lasted one hour. HMS Mantis was making its debut in Shanghai, and its football skills were mediocre, with no outstanding players. Lido defeated them easily. Tan Fuzhen's performance in yesterday's match was not as outstanding as when he participated in the previous World Games qualifiers. Zhang Xueyao was still steady, but his footwork was lacking, probably due to a lack of practice. The most outstanding performer was Xu Wenkui, who was able to attack and defend, with his skillful dribbling and accurate passing playing the opposing team at will. Just four minutes after the start of the match, Zhang Mingsheng took a corner kick, Xu Wenkui headed the ball to Li Yichen, who added a header, and the ball flew into the net. Six minutes later, Cao Qiuting got the ball and shot, and Xu used the same trick again. Li added another shot and scored again. After fifteen minutes, Sun Jinshun, assisted by Cao Qiuting, launched a long-range shot, and the iron leg hit the target. Xu Wenkui, seeing this, also scored a goal in the twentieth minute. At the end of the first half, Lido was ahead 4-0. As the second half began, the British Navy still showed no improvement. Within three minutes, Li Yichen shot, and although the opponent's goalkeeper saved the ball, it had already crossed the goal line, but the referee ignored it. Three minutes later, Sun Iron Leg, picked out by Zhang Mingsheng, shot and hit the bullseye. After seventeen minutes, Cao Qiuting passed to Li Yichen, who swept the ball into the net. In the last five minutes, Xu Wenkui and Li Yichen each scored another goal. As the silver whistle blew, Lido defeated the British Navy by a landslide of 8-0.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Japanese Navy Threatens to Attack Haimen, Zhejiang; Hope to Notify Third-Country Vessels; Deadline to Leave Taizhou Tonight -- Ningbo People in Shanghai Remain Calm -- <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, abruptly notified the consulates of England, America, Italy, France, Norway, Portugal, etc., the day before yesterday that the Japanese Navy will take military action in Haimen, Zhejiang, and hopes to notify third-country ships to leave by the evening of the 17th (today). Foreign shipping companies have all received notification from their respective consulates. Foreign ships docked in Taizhou plan to temporarily leave to observe the situation. The Ningbo people in Shanghai remain calm. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Announces Attack on Taizhou</p>
<p>The consulates of England, America, Italy, Germany, Norway, Portugal, etc., in Shanghai suddenly received a notification from Japanese Consul Miura the night before last, saying that the Japanese Navy stationed in eastern Zhejiang will soon take military action in Taizhou Bay and Haimen. They hope to immediately inform third-country merchant ships to leave or stop sailing to Haimen by 6:00 PM on this month, the 17th (today), and must be at least 30 nautical miles away. Otherwise, the Japanese military will not be responsible for any damages that occur. After receiving the above notification, the consulates immediately informed their respective national shipping companies to pay attention.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Temporarily Evacuate to Observe the Situation</p>
<p>Currently, the only ship docked in Haimen preparing to spend the Spring Festival is the Shantai Wheel of the Portuguese Zhengde Company. In order to temporarily avoid accidents and observe the situation, the Shanghai company has telegraphed the shipowner to return to Shanghai immediately. Yesterday afternoon, they received a reply confirming that the ship will leave Taizhou for Shanghai this morning. In addition, the American Menda Transport of the American Merrill Company sailed from Ou to Taizhou yesterday morning and arrived that evening. It is scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo this morning. The Tangbei Wheel of the American Huamei Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and originally planned to sail to Taizhou today for the New Year. It has now been decided to suspend sailing temporarily. The British Yong Sheng Wheel, rented by Ning Shao Company, was originally scheduled to sail to Taizhou today but has been changed to sail directly to Ningbo. Whether to transfer from Ningbo to Taizhou will depend on how the situation develops. As for the Shanghai-Taizhou Qianhana and Haifu Wheels, they are currently in Shanghai for annual repairs.</p>
<p>Ningbo People in Shanghai Remain Calm</p>
<p>Since the above news came out, it has attracted the attention of the people of Ningbo. However, according to general speculation, Haimen is a barren area in eastern Zhejiang, producing nothing other than some citrus fruits, and has no important military significance. It is now known that only one Japanese warship, No. 4, is stationed in the waters of eastern Zhejiang, and its strength is not enough to land. In the coastal area of Haimen, our side has deployed nets, and the local self-defense corps and able-bodied men also have considerable resistance. If Japan invades, it will be severely attacked. Japan's announcement of this decision may be of a threatening nature, and even if military action is taken, it will only be a harassment. As for Ningbo and Wenzhou, the coastal fortresses are extremely well-defended, and Japan's plan will be difficult to succeed. Therefore, the Ningbo people in Shanghai are very calm and do not attach much importance to the above news.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Opposing Wan Tai's Monopoly of the Sand and Gravel Industry; Four Gang Sand Barges Strike to Assist; Sand and Gravel Industry Association Petitioned the Public Works Bureau Yesterday; 7,000 Tons of Korean Sand Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday for Dumping <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>After the sand and gravel industry struck to oppose Wan Tai's monopoly, the association petitioned the Public Works Bureau and other authorities yesterday to protect their business. The four gang sand barge industries, upon receiving notification from the association, have ceased operations starting today and plan to petition the Taxpayers Association and various Chinese directors again today for assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Association Petition</p>
<p>The Sand and Gravel Industry Association yesterday sent representatives Lu Xiaozuo, Cao Genggui, Fang Changgen, Xu Yongde, and others to petition Deputy General Manager He and the Public Works Department of the Political Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau, requesting them to protect their business. Their petition stated, "According to a letter from our member, Wanxing Sand and Gravel Company, our company is contracted to supply yellow sand to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau. We have hired seven sailing boats, including No. 875 Qian Dexing, No. 734 San Hexing, and No. 941 Xin Dexing, to transport sand to Shanghai for use. These ships all have certificates issued by the Public Works Bureau on file. Last month, when these ships sailed to Sijiao Mountain, the original sand mining site, to load sand, all seven ships hired by our company, including Qian Dexing, were refused loading by the local maintenance committee. They said that in the future, sand-carrying ships must register with Shanghai Wan Tai Company and obtain a permit before loading. Furthermore, all the sand transported must be unloaded and sold by the company; otherwise, loading permits will not be issued. Therefore, currently, among the seven ships, only the sand transported by Qian Dexing, Fuli, and Dongyuan has been unloaded to the Public Works Department's warehouse. The remaining ships cannot go to their destinations to mine and transport sand, and are staying in Shanghai. In this situation, the source of sand and gravel in Shanghai is completely monopolized by Wan Tai Company and the Sijiao Sand and Gravel Maintenance Committee. The boatmen and laborers are impoverished and find it difficult to survive. Not only are our members affected, but your bureau's Public Works Department cannot freely obtain sand and gravel." Therefore, in addition to reporting the details of the situation to your bureau, we have sent representatives Lu Xiaozuo, Cao Genggui, Fang Changgen, Xu Chengde, and others to present the documents and personally explain everything to your office. We hope to be received and ask for your support and assistance, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Four Gang Strike</p>
<p>The four gang sand barges, specializing in transporting sand and gravel from Sijiao Mountain, include: Xiushan Gang, about 100 ships; Cen Gang Gang, about 50 ships; Shao Yu Gang, about 20 ships; Sijiao Gang, about 30 ships. In total, there are about 200 sand barges in these four gangs. They have now been notified by the association to stop loading to avoid being exploited. Starting today, they will unanimously strike to assist, so the arrival of sand barges in Shanghai will be cut off.</p>
<p>Korean Sand Dumping</p>
<p>According to news from the sand and gravel industry reported by the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the Japanese ship Kinpei Maru transported 7,500 tons of sand and gravel from Korea yesterday and is currently docked at buoy No. 14 in Yangshupu. In addition to supplying the Japanese construction projects, this sand and gravel is also being dumped on the Shanghai market. It is reported that after receiving the news, the sand and gravel industry has notified its members and sand and gravel dealers to unanimously refuse to sell it.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Chambers of Commerce and Tea Industry; Telegram Requesting Release of Rough Tea for Transport to Shanghai; No Reason to Prohibit Domestic Sale of Rough Tea; Zhejiang Customs' Enforcement of Regulations May Be Excessive <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The tea merchants in this city mainly engage in domestic sales of tea leaves. Last spring, they sent personnel to Zhejiang and Anhui to purchase rough tea and transport it to Ningbo, then to Shanghai. After purchasing foreign exchange according to regulations, the Ningbo office of the Trade Commission issued transport permits. Now, the Zhejiang Customs refuses to release the tea, claiming it is enforcing an order prohibiting the transport of goods to Shanghai that aid the enemy. It is now reported that the Tea Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believe that the rough tea is intended for domestic sale and should be released. They have sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Finance requesting this. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Industry Telegram</p>
<p>To the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Affairs: Regarding the Zhejiang Customs' misunderstanding of the prohibition order and preventing the transport of tea, we urgently request that you order its release to comply with national policy and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Our association members specialize in the domestic sales of tea leaves. Previously, due to the high demand in Shanghai, we collected various types of rough tea from the Zhejiang and Anhui tea regions last spring and transported it to Ningbo for shipment to Shanghai for sale, in large quantities. Initially, processing the inspection procedures in accordance with the regulations for domestic sales of rough tea caused difficulties for half a year before the Ningbo office of the Trade Commission settled the foreign exchange and issued transport permits. Just as we were preparing to ship the tea to Shanghai, the Zhejiang Customs, citing the Ministry of Economic Affairs' regulations prohibiting the transport of goods aiding the enemy, claimed that tea leaves aid the enemy and that Shanghai is a prohibited area, and refused to release the tea. However, the purpose of this prohibition order is to prevent raw materials from aiding the enemy and reducing national strength. Shanghai is not under enemy control, and tea leaves are by no means a necessity for military use. The Zhejiang Customs' enforcement of the prohibition is inappropriate. Moreover, there are separate regulations for the domestic sale and export of domestic tea leaves, which are handled by the Trade Adjustment Commission, which is sufficient to prevent abuses. The aforementioned tea remaining in Ningbo is all rough tea for domestic sale and has been approved for transport by the commission. The Zhejiang Customs' continued prohibition is even more inappropriate. (Omitted paragraph) Tea is best when fresh. The aforementioned rough tea was all produced last spring and has been held up in the Ningbo River for over six months, causing much of it to mold. Soon it will be Qingming Festival, and new tea will be on the market, making it difficult to sell the old tea. Not only will our association members lose all their capital, but the economy of the tea-producing regions will also suffer a significant impact. Therefore, we urgently present our case, hoping that you will consider it and issue an order to the Zhejiang Customs to release the tea quickly. We await your orders with great anxiety. Shanghai Tea Industry Association and members Chun Ji, Tong Taixiang, Yuan Fengxiang, and thirteen other companies respectfully request.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Economic Affairs: According to a letter from the Shanghai Tea Industry Association (omitted): We believe that since the tea leaves are intended for domestic sale, foreign exchange has been settled, and the nature of the goods is not related to aiding the enemy, there is no reason to prohibit transport. Furthermore, the Zhen telegram from your ministry on the first day of the year also stated, "Domestic tea leaves should still be handled according to the current review procedures of the Trade Commission," which does not indicate an absolute prohibition. This time, the Zhejiang Customs' refusal to allow the tea remaining in Ningbo to be transported to Shanghai is an excessive enforcement of regulations. We request that your ministry review and issue an order to the Zhejiang Customs to investigate and release the tea for the public good. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japanese Residents in Hongkou; Occupying Houses <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>9,000 Residents Living Without Permission; Many Owning Up to 18 Months of Rent</p>
<p>The Dalu News reported that in the "Finance and Business" magazine published yesterday (the 15th), citing figures published in a certain Japanese newspaper, 9,000 Japanese residents in Hongkou have illegally occupied houses north of the Suzhou River without the permission of the landlords. The magazine stated that it emphatically declares the seriousness of the situation. If it is true that 9,000 residents avoid paying rent, then there must be more Japanese residents than this number.</p>
<p>Not Paying A Single Cent</p>
<p>Land tax, and see how the Public Works Bureau feels about this issue, there are many landlords who are spending a great deal to repair houses. Although this move to cater to the wishes of the tenants, but the rent continues to be unpaid. There are currently Japanese tenants who owe several months of rent. When the war began, they moved out and waited for the situation to permit, without the owner's permission, moved back into their houses. Many of them not only do not try to clear pre-war rent, but also the current rent, not to compensate, therefore, homeowners are now encountering nine months to eighteen months overdue rent of</p>
<p>Bad Tenants</p>
<p>One of the problems that the Japanese authorities are concerned about. We are still comforted to hear that, at the end of the magazine, the above are from an article recently published in a certain Japanese newspaper in this port, which stated that there are about 12,200 Japanese-occupied stores, houses or factories in the Hongkou district, but so far only 2,163 have registered with the Japanese Residents Association to report their rental.</p>

<p>According to Kuai Xun News Agency, after Cai Xiren was appointed as the Administrative Commissioner of the nine counties in the suburbs of Shanghai by the Free Jiangsu Provincial Government, the guerrilla district heads of the nine counties of Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Shanghai, Nanhui, Chuansha, Fengxian, Jiading, and Baoshan have also been appointed. Governments have been established in these counties to promote the anti-Japanese administration in the guerrilla areas. Now, the Third War Zone Headquarters of the East Battlefield has also appointed Cai Xiren concurrently as the Songhu Garrison Commander. Cai has already taken office and is working closely with the guerrilla commanders in the suburbs, such as Ding Xishan.</p>

<p>In recent days, the Chinese military guerrilla forces in the suburbs of Shanghai have become more active. Yesterday on the Qinghu Highway, there was another guerrilla attack. At about 11:00 AM, a public bus of the Huazhong Automobile Company, which is protected by the Japanese side, carrying more than 20 passengers, was traveling from Qingpu to Xujing. Suddenly, Chinese guerrilla forces jumped out from the vicinity, fired blank shots at the bus, and ordered it to stop. The Japanese driver, in a panic, mistakenly drove the bus into the field. The guerrilla forces came forward to search the bus, and detained the Japanese driver and two Japanese ticket collectors. Among the passengers, more than 20 Chinese, except for two who were injured after falling out of the bus and came to Shanghai for treatment, all were unharmed. It is also learned that a truck of a certain automobile company in Shanghai was also detained by the guerrilla forces on its way to Qingpu to transport food. It is said that it will only be decided whether or not to release it after the use of the food has been clarified.</p>

<p>The Japanese army and navy have been arguing over the tax revenues from various ports along the Yangtze River. Their opinions have been irreconcilable, and in recent days, the situation has escalated, leading to a conflict at Xiaochuansha on the evening of the 14th. The situation was very tense, and the residents of the town all fled. The situation did not escalate until the Japanese military authorities took measures to deal with it. However, the Japanese army and navy have deep grievances, and sooner or later a serious incident will occur. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Conflict</p>
<p>Xiaochuansha is under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County and is located between Wusong and Liuhe, a key point along the Yangtze River, about four or five miles from the port. There is a small town, with very few residents on weekdays. During the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, the National Army persisted in resisting. After two months, because the Japanese army landed in Xiaochuansha, outflanking the Datang and Luodian rear routes, the National Army was attacked on three sides. In order to maintain its strength, it abandoned Zhabei. Therefore, since the war, Xiaochuansha has become a commercial and transportation area. The Japanese side considered the town a military stronghold. In addition to stationing dozens of Japanese army soldiers, Japanese warships also frequently patrolled back and forth. Before the troops were stationed last year, trade and freight were very developed, and tax revenues were quite high. However, after the Japanese army was stationed, the entry and exit of various merchants and goods decreased sharply, and tax revenue was limited. However, the Japanese side still regarded it as a forbidden fruit. The tax revenue was mainly controlled by the stationed army and the puppet organization, while the navy along the river could not share the benefits. At first, they used various means to indirectly squeeze the merchants and travelers, but in recent days, the grievances between the Japanese army and navy have deepened, leading to a direct conflict.</p>
<p>The Whole Town in Turmoil</p>
<p>When the Japanese army and navy clashed on the evening of the 14th of this month, the gunfire was fierce. The Japanese army stationed on the shore was in a state of tension. The residents of the town suspected it was an exercise or an attack by guerrillas. Later, the navy landed and aimed their guns at the Japanese army on the shore, and then it was realized that the Japanese army was in conflict with each other. The residents of the whole town were panic-stricken and fled to the surrounding countryside in the darkness. By dawn the next morning (the 15th), the gunfire had stopped and the situation had eased slightly. All the naval forces that had landed returned to the warships. At about 12:00 noon, the Japanese warship left the sand and sailed towards Wusong.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Suppressed</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities kept the conflict between the Japanese army and navy secret. According to people from Baoshan and Jiading who came one after another, the inside story of the incident (revealed by the puppet organization) was that the root cause of the conflict was completely a struggle for power. After the two sides developed into special actions, the Japanese military authorities learned about it and immediately tried to suppress it. It was not expanded. However, judging from the current situation of the Japanese army and navy in various places, they are abnormally resentful of each other, and a more serious incident will occur sooner or later.</p>

<p>The foreign ships Hafar, Yongzhen, and Haida, etc., sailing between Shanghai and Funing, were previously illegally seized by Japanese warships and customs patrol boats and sailed to Qingdao. Furthermore, Japanese planes bombed and harassed the Hexing Town, causing the ships to be unable to sail and stop operating one after another. The British ship Yongzhen and the Norwegian ship Hafar have changed to Tianjin, while the Norwegian ship Haida has changed to Hong Kong. However, the British ship Marler Company's Kailing authorities believe that foreign merchants sailing to the port is a legal right and cannot be stopped due to Japanese obstruction. Therefore, it resolutely sailed to try the voyage a few days ago. When the ship arrived at the Yanghekou, the Japanese warships did not take any action, so it sailed into the port and docked at Hexing Town. However, most of the merchants there have dispersed, so there were no goods to load. It has been staying in the port for many days and is said to sail back to Shanghai today and tomorrow. Because the cargo transportation has sharply decreased, the next shift will not be sailing and will be changed to another route.</p>

<p>According to sources, after the Hanyang Arsenal was occupied by the Japanese army, the bottom of the heavy machinery and equipment that the Chinese army did not have time to move away were successively dismantled and transported away by transport ships. Recently, a large amount of iron sand has also been transported away in batches. Three days ago, the Japanese transport ship Yamagata Maru arrived in Shanghai from the Yangtze River, loaded with more than 1,000 tons of iron sand and more than 1,000 tons of factory iron on the Huangpu River, and transported it back to Japan together.</p>

<p>The English Great American Evening Post reported that Chinese guerrillas launched a brave attack last night (the 15th), throwing a hand grenade at two Japanese patrol soldiers on Huade Road between Lan Road and Ningguo Road. The Japanese soldiers were seriously injured. Therefore, Japanese Marine Corps soldiers searched all passing cars, trucks, and pedestrians on the bridges over the Suzhou River this morning (the 16th). The guerrillas also attacked a truck driving from Shanghai to Qingpu and overturned it. The driver of the car walked back to the vicinity of the Hongqiao Airport, hired a car, and brought it into the city.</p>

<p>The dredging work in the port of Shanghai has been suspended since the dredgers and survey ships of the Dredging Bureau were all detained, causing the silt in the Huangpu River to accumulate day by day, which is enough to harm navigation. It is now learned that the matter has been continued by the Inspector General of Customs to negotiate with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side has conditioned on the Dredging Bureau hiring Japanese personnel, so the negotiation has been difficult to progress. However, it is currently rumored that the negotiations between the two sides have made more progress than before, but the truth is not easy to know.</p>

<p>The Zilin News reported that at the Japanese press conference last night (the 15th), a reporter asked whether there were gunshots in the French Concession a few days ago, and whether there was a war near the French Concession. The Japanese military spokesman admitted that in the past few days, there may have been some military actions against guerrilla forces in the Shanghai area, and said that the gunshots were clearly heard in the French Concession because of the wind. As far as he knew, the war took place outside of Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Two Puppets Killed; Tu Zhenhu and Gao Hongzao Both Found Dead on the Roadside; Tu Was the Puppet "President of the Local Court"; Gao Was the Puppet "Clerk of the Police Bureau" <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, two successive shooting assassination cases occurred on Annakin Road and between Father Du Road and Baylor Road in the French Concession. The victims were both puppets of the puppet organization. One was Tu Zhenhu, a native of Wujin and the current puppet president of the Nanshi Local Court. The other was Gao Hongzao, a native of Tianjin and the clerk of the Water Patrol Team of the puppet Police Bureau. Both were fatally wounded and died on the spot. The murderers in both cases escaped calmly. The situation at the time is described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Tu Zhenhu</p>
<p>Formerly a Lawyer</p>
<p>Tu Zhenhu, formerly known as Tu Fu, a native of Wujin, joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member in February of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933). He was 52 years old and had been practicing law in Shanghai for five years. He lived with his second wife, Tu Yuan, (36 years old, from Suzhou) in No. 24, Lane 5, Hengqingli, the intersection of Baylor Road and Xujiahui Road in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Appointed to a Puppet Position</p>
<p>In the late autumn of last year, Tu pursued the path of the "New Government" in Nanjing and became the puppet president of the Nanshi Local Court in Shanghai. Because the original site of the Shanghai court was burned down, Tu chose the site of the Xicheng Elementary School on Penglai Road and began to arrange it. On January 1 of this year, it was hastily established and announced its inauguration, and he appointed two lawyers, Fei Guoxi and Chen Guocai, from the industry to be the presiding judges of the civil and criminal courts.</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>Tu went to the court every day to work, leaving his residence in the morning and returning late at night. He was accompanied by more than a dozen guards to prevent accidents. Even in the puppet court in Nanshi, he asked the puppet police bureau to send many puppet police to the court for protection. In recent days, Tu did not go to the Nanshi office and stayed at home.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ambushed</p>
<p>At 11:45 yesterday morning, Tu left his residence at No. 24, Hengqingli, wearing a green-gray robe and a black serge overcoat, walking through Tianxiangli from Hengqingli, (the two alleys were connected after the war). Suddenly, a strong man rushed out from in front of Tu and fired three shots at Tu with a gun when he was just at No. 53, under the building crossing the street. Tu had no time to dodge and was hit in the head, right eyebrow, and chest.</p>
<p>Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Two bullets hit the breast, and another bullet knocked off Tu's hat. Tu fell to the ground after being hit. Because the injuries were fatal, he died immediately. The man who fired the gun saw that his purpose had been achieved and calmly left the alley. By the time the French police arrived after receiving the report, the murderer had long disappeared, only three bullet casings were recovered.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>The detectives stopped traffic in the alley and investigated in detail, but found nothing. At 12:30, after the photo of Tu's body was taken, it was carried to the autopsy room of the Public Works Bureau Hospital on Taras Road to wait for the autopsy. At the same time, Tu's wife, Yuan, was summoned by the police to investigate.</p>
<p>(2) Gao Hongzao</p>
<p>Puppet Team Clerk</p>
<p>Gao Hongzao, a native of Tianjin, is 36 years old. He was formerly a clerk in the clerk's office of the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. After the war broke out last year, Nanshi fell, and the National Army moved west. After the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau ended, Gao managed to become the clerk of the Water Patrol Team of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Dadao Municipal Government Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Living with a Concubine</p>
<p>Gao lived with his concubine in the three-story pavilion room at No. 25 Dunrenli in Jinyuli on Annakin Road in the French Concession. His wife and children still lived in their original home in Tianjin. At 7:40 yesterday morning, Gao got up from his residence, wearing a black serge suit, a brown thick serge overcoat, a hat, and leather shoes, and left his residence.</p>
<p>Killed</p>
<p>Suddenly, two strong men jumped out from the side of the road and pointed a gun at Gao and fired several shots when he had just stepped out of the alley of Quanyuli on Annakin Road and crossed the road. Gao was caught off guard and was hit three times in the head, and then fell in front of No. 145 Runkang Xinnan Goods Store and No. 147 Yiben Coal Store, and died immediately.</p>
<p>The Murderers Escaped</p>
<p>The two strong men who committed the murder turned around and left. After receiving the report, the French police immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. A Westerner from the photography department of the General Patrol Bureau carried equipment to the scene and took photos of the place where the deceased fell for future reference. The detectives also recovered several bullet casings from the scene.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure People</p>
<p>When the strong men opened fire to kill Gao, stray bullets were flying. An old woman, Mrs. Lu Wang, who lived at No. 16, Jinyuli, was passing by the scene and was hit and fell to the ground. She was taken to the Guangci Hospital for treatment by the police car.</p>

<p>The Zilin News reported that on Tuesday afternoon, several bullet casings were recovered at the scene of the shooting case near Fahua Town on Columbia Road. Yesterday (the 15th), it was proven that the firearms that fired the bullets were known to the Public Concession authorities, and the firearms had been used by people who appeared to be Chinese irregular forces in recent weeks. It is said that two Koreans and one Chinese who were selling drugs in the Japanese-controlled area were killed in a similar execution-style shooting. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Road patrol station obtained several bullet casings abandoned by the assassins. It was proven that they were fired from high-speed C96 pistols and smaller automatic pistols. Many of the atrocities in the outer road areas in recent weeks have been committed by the above-mentioned firearms. These crimes include assassinating personnel from the so-called "Shanghai Municipal Government," sniping Public Concession patrol officers, and raiding several puppet police stations. After inspection by the ordnance experts at the police headquarters, it was proven that these crimes were committed by the same large group.</p>

All money shops, factories, and firms have rushed to complete their final closing and will take a four-day holiday starting on the 19th to sort everything out. Because of the abnormal development of all industries in the Shanghai Concession after the war, and with the efforts of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China to maintain stability, the financial market has been as stable as ever. Business and industry are determined to pass the New Year safely. The call loan interest rate in the money market is open until today. Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Eve. Money shops extend the time for accepting checks, doing internal office work, until dawn. The collection and delivery of money by banks and money shops has been particularly busy in recent days. The exchange of bills by the two industries has increased sharply. Banks will increase the exchange once tomorrow, and money shops will extend the exchange by two hours tomorrow.</p>

The collection point is at 57 Nanjing Road. The Deputy Commander of the Army expressed great gratitude for the generosity of the Chinese donors. Many donations were made under the names of anonymous donors or "Chinese friends." The Salvation Army will continue its good works of assisting released prisoners, operating training centers for homeless children, and providing relief to foreigners, as well as establishing a refugee camp to accommodate 43,000 refugees.</p>

The Yihe steamer on the Haimen-Qidong line is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 23rd. Except for Yuanlong Company's Kelisiding and Zhenxin Company's Aweimali, scheduled to resume sailings on the 23rd, it is uncertain whether other companies will continue to operate or lease new vessels due to business reasons. Therefore, there is no definite date for resumption of service. As for the special Ningbo route, only Ning Shao Company's newly leased Yong Sheng (i.e., Joan Maller) is scheduled to depart at 5 p.m. today.

<p>The North China Daily News reports that Kawashima Yoshiko, known as "Japan's Mata Hari," was shot by patriots while visiting a friend in Tianjin on New Year's Eve last year. She died from severe wounds in a Tianjin hospital last Sunday. With Kawashima's assassination, Japan has lost a woman comparable to Europe's</p>
<p>greatest female spy</p>
<p>during the World War. On that day, Kawashima went to the Madanfu Hospital (transliteration) on Dagu Road (transliteration) in the French Concession of Tianjin to visit the wife of wealthy businessman Wang Zhuolin (transliteration), who was assassinated in December of last year. Suddenly, she was ambushed by four Chinese patriots. Wang's wife was killed, and Kawashima was also seriously injured. She was taken to Tianjin Hospital, where it was hoped she could recover, but she eventually died in the hospital. Kawashima set up</p>
<p>a Chinese restaurant</p>
<p>on Songdao Road in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin. She was originally the third daughter of Prince Su of the Qing Dynasty, who fled to Lushun in 1912, and a cousin of Puyi. After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, Prince Su died, and she was adopted by Japanese man Kawashima Naniwa, who took her to Japan. Therefore, Kawashima grew up in Japan and was educated in Japan. In 1927, Kawashima was 21 years old and</p>
<p>left Japan for Dalian.</p>
<p>At the end of that year, she married a Japanese military officer. After the divorce, she married a Mongolian prince, but that also ended in divorce. During the September 18th Incident, she went to Tianjin and drove the escaped Puyi away in a car. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, Kawashima engaged in espionage in Shanghai. After the end of the Shanghai war, she returned to Dalian and lived a dissolute life in taverns.</p>
<p>During her time in Shanghai,</p>
<p>she also frequented various taverns, sometimes even wearing men's clothing and traveling with several women. Recently, she organized the so-called Dingguo Army (transliteration) cavalry regiment in Rehe, which was highly valued by the Japanese army and navy.</p>

More than 20 thatched houses were burned down and spread to more than 20 simple houses near Wuding Road. Fire trucks rushed to the scene and completely extinguished the fire at around 8 p.m. The residents in the area are all common people. With the Lunar New Year approaching, they suffered this misfortune and cried bitterly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens Group Fundraising Committee recently issued a "One-Day Disaster Relief Campaign" declaration, saying, "Celebrating the Lunar New Year, what a happy time! So, things that shouldn't be wasted are wasted, and things that shouldn't be gambled are gambled. Giving New Year's gifts and eating New Year's feasts are routine affairs and unavoidable behaviors, not to mention anything else. Ah, let us think about the Shanghai refugees, spending the New Year in hunger and cold. What kind of scene is that? If we close our eyes and imagine ourselves in their situation, how bitter it is! Therefore, all Shanghai citizens should think about the refugees in every move during this Lunar New Year celebration, so that they can also celebrate the Lunar New Year. They should save one day's (or several days') waste to relieve the refugees; donate one day's (or several days') profit to relieve the refugees; donate one day's (or several days') salary to relieve the refugees; save New Year's expenses to relieve the refugees; save New Year's feast expenses to relieve the refugees (the cost of several New Year's gifts and one New Year's feast can save several refugees). Participating in the "One-Day Disaster Relief Campaign" is the responsibility of Shanghai citizens. Continue to sponsor refugees by practicing New Year's savings. Our methods are: 1. Date: The Citizens' "One-Day Disaster Relief Campaign" is scheduled to be held on February 23, i.e., the fifth day of the Lunar New Year (but it is welcome to transfer the savings from New Year's gifts to help the refugees in advance). 2. Collection: Please send donations for the "One-Day Campaign" to our association (Room 414, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road) or notify our association (telephone 18533) to send someone to collect. 3.

<p>Ren Xipeng, over 60 years old from Jiangbei, used to sell used goods in Nanshi. After Nanshi fell, he made every effort to ingratiate himself, recklessly flattering the Japanese. He became a member of the Nanshi Autonomous Association and falsely established the Fushun Shelter on Dajing Road, serving as the district chief of the refugee area. He relied on a talisman from a Japanese officer, Mo Yifu, to embezzle food and rape women, offering refugee women for abuse by foreigners. His son, Ren Xiaopeng (nickname "Little Red Serpent"), was unscrupulous and stole the exquisite rosewood furniture of residents and sold it, amounting to tens of thousands of gold. Although the victims filed complaints, they were helpless because he had a powerful backer. He became even more intensified and falsely established the Fushun Charity Association, using the excuse of handling corpses in Nanshi. In recent months, shockingly cruel methods have been discovered. He would remove the corpses from the coffins of middle and upper-class families at night, replace them with four pine boards, and strip the burial clothes from the corpses, resulting in more than a hundred tragic cases. The victims repeatedly complained without effect. Recently, the Chaozhou Guild Hall, Siming Public Office, Yongxi Hall, Huizhou Guild Hall, Jingjiang Public Office, etc., together with the bereaved families, jointly complained to Father Rao of the International Relief Committee. After Father Rao's investigation, he informed the "Nanshi Branch" to go to the upstairs bedroom of the Fushun Charity Association on Dajing Road with the Japanese military police. They found more than a hundred sets of burial clothes stripped from the corpses and more than twenty superior coffins that had been modified. Ren and his son Ren Xiaopeng were arrested. The former Ren Xipeng was arrested and detained the other day, awaiting severe punishment. However, now the general victims have jointly submitted a petition to the Japanese Military Police Department, demanding that Ren and his son be decapitated to satisfy public anger.</p>

Yesterday morning, the Xinzha Police Station cracked two cases of mixing counterfeit banknotes. In one case, a woman named Xu Wangshi was arrested. When she was arrested, two counterfeit five-yuan notes of the Chinese Farmers Bank were found on her, with the numbers 267444 and 267446. When the woman was brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for interrogation, she claimed that the two banknotes were either given by the pawnshop as</p>
<p>pledged items</p>
<p>or were savings from washing clothes for people, and she did not know they were counterfeit notes. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu revealed that the woman's statement was false, saying that according to the defendant's testimony, it is known that the sources of the two banknotes are absolutely different. However, observing the numbers on the banknotes, there is only one number difference, and there can be no such coincidence. This shows that the statement is not credible. Moreover, the woman has been punished by the Second Special District Court for mixing counterfeit banknotes before and is now a repeat offender and should be severely punished. Judge Meng then ordered the defendant to be detained,</p>
<p>awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>In the other case, Shan Bangzhen, manager of the Zhongli Tin Foil Shop at 320 Xinzha Road, and Zhang Yongpei, the accountant, sent Chen Wuzhong, an unemployed youth from the same hometown who lived in the shop, with two counterfeit five-yuan notes of the Bank of China to purchase tin foil at the nearby Guanghe Tin Foil Shop at 302. At that time, Chen purchased tin foil worth 15.3 yuan. Among the three five-yuan banknotes paid, two were counterfeit, with the</p>
<p>note numbers</p>
<p>being 267463 and 267406. After Ma Zhenxing, a staff member of Guanghe, discovered this, he asked Chen to exchange them. Chen refused to exchange them because he had been repeatedly instructed by Shan and Zhang, claiming that it was too far away and inconvenient to go back and forth. Seeing that there was no reason to be made, Ma called the police and took Chen, along with the counterfeit banknotes and the purchased tin foil, to the Xinzha Police Station. After the head of the police sent detective Chen Baozhong and a Western detective to interrogate Chen, they</p>
<p>continued to arrest</p>
<p>Shan and Zhang. Yesterday morning, they were brought to the First Special Court together with Chen Yuanzhong and interrogated by Judge Meng Tingke. After the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, Ma Zhenxing immediately testified to prove that Chen Yuanzhong had intentionally mixed the counterfeit banknotes at the time. When questioned, Chen admitted that he was sent by Shan and Zhang to Guanghe to purchase tin foil, and Shan et al. instructed him not to exchange them even if they were discovered. Shan Bangzhen still claimed that he did not know the banknotes were counterfeit. The court questioned him about the</p>
<p>source of the counterfeit banknotes,</p>
<p>but he was evasive. Later, Shao Yu, speaking in his native dialect, admitted that the banknotes were received at the store and repeatedly said, "The New Year is coming, please help, sir." Zhang Peiyong fully admitted to the fact that he knew they were counterfeit banknotes and specially sent Chen to Guanghe to purchase tin foil. After Judge Meng finished the interrogation, he ordered the start of the debate. The police lawyer then stated that the defendant's attempt to use counterfeit banknotes was fully proven, but he was still</p>
<p>evasive.</p>
<p>He was originally a tin foil shop, but he bought tin foil from others. This alone is enough to prove that he was intentionally using counterfeit banknotes and should be heavily fined. The defendant's lawyer then defended them, and the court subsequently sentenced Chen, Shan, and Zhang to a fine of 50 yuan each. If they were to do labor service, they would be compensated at one yuan per day, and the counterfeit banknotes were confiscated.</p>

<p>The Yihua Cotton Mill, a British-owned enterprise on Weituoma Road, Yangshupu, suddenly experienced a strike wave the other day. At that time, the order was chaotic and the situation was dangerous. The Yulin Road Police Station, upon hearing the alarm, immediately led a large number of Chinese and Western detectives led by Western Detective Chief Heiden to the scene. They arrested a total of eighty workers on the pier who were preventing people from going to work and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. It was determined that a special interrogation would be scheduled later. However, after that, the police successively arrested two batches of twenty-six and fourteen workers involved in the incident, and they have been sent to the Special Court one after another for punishment. Yesterday afternoon, these eighty Jiangnan people were sent by the police to the First Special Court for continued interrogation. Judge Fang Qinghuan presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police side said that because there were so many people involved in this case, a large number of dozens of Chinese and Western patrols were specially dispatched to distribute them around the court to maintain security, and the situation suddenly became serious. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case. After Judge Fang questioned each defendant and made it clear, he gave them punishment respectively. The terms of imprisonment varied from forty days to thirty days.</p>

<p>Xiao Yuezhen, wife of Shenqu opera star Xiao Wenbin, had a quarrel with Wenbin's mother the night before because of a minor matter. At that time, Yuezhen slapped her mother-in-law twice. Xiao Wenbin happened to be not at home at the time. After Wenbin returned home, his mother told him the truth. Wenbin was extremely angry and filed for divorce with Yuezhen. Through the mediation of the famous female figure Lu Laoqi, both parties agreed to terminate their marital relationship. The terms of negotiation were that Wenbin would give Yuezhen 3,000 yuan in one lump sum and a monthly allowance of 500 yuan. However, the condition stated that although they had terminated their marital relationship, they would still cooperate in performing Shenqu opera. According to people familiar with the entertainment industry, the divorce between Wenbin and Yuezhen was expected by some people. It was faintly heard that if Xiao Wenbin did not divorce Yuezhen as soon as possible, Wenbin might face unexpected lawsuits with other third parties.</p>

<p>Wang Gengsheng, a native of Changzhou, is 48 years old this year and currently lives at No. 10 Wulin Lane, Xinzha Road. He used to make a living farming in his hometown. He had a daughter named Wang Jinfeng, who is in her early twenties. She received a little education in her childhood. Later, Wang, because his situation became increasingly difficult, could not afford to have Jinfeng continue her studies. Until 1934, through a friend's introduction, she came to Shanghai to work as a dancer in a dance hall, changed her name to Fang Lili, and began her</p>
<p>hugging career.</p>
<p>She was once very popular. A few years ago, Jiang Yongnian, a young man from Ningbo (22 years old, currently living at No. 86 Weihaiwei Road, whose father, Jiang Changqi, is the former director of the cashier section of the Lianglu Administration), frequented the dance floor, behaved lavishly, and had a private car (numbered 375). Seeing that Miss Wang was beautiful, he</p>
<p>began to seduce her.</p>
<p>He often went to the dance hall to support her, in order to win her heart. Until July 28 of the year before last, Jiang suddenly went to Miss Wang's place, using the excuse of going out for a trip, and took Miss Wang in his private car to Hangzhou, where they spent three days sleeping together in the Dahua Hotel. They also took photos together at various scenic spots. After returning to Shanghai, he promised to choose a date to marry her and</p>
<p>lived together</p>
<p>at No. 14 Daodeli, Kaizi Liang Road, which Miss Wang rented. Since then, Miss Wang became secretly pregnant. On April 28 of last year, she gave birth to a son at Dadet Hospital on Gordon Road, named Jiang Ahu, who looked very much like Jiang Yongnian. Unexpectedly, Jiang Yongnian recently became involved with another woman, becoming fond of the new and tired of the old, and treated Miss Wang like a stranger. At first, he still entrusted a friend, Sun Liang, to send living expenses, but recently he has</p>
<p>stopped coming altogether.</p>
<p>Miss Wang, because of what she encountered, only sighed at her fate. However, Miss Wang's father, Wang Gengsheng, was unwilling, so in his capacity as legal guardian, he specially hired lawyer Feng Meixue and sued Jiang Yongnian in the criminal court of the Second Special Court for the crime of intentionally raping and abducting a minor and leaving home at night. In the first instance, Jiang Yongnian was found not guilty. Wang,</p>
<p>not satisfied with the verdict,</p>
<p>presented evidence and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After several trials, the verdict was announced yesterday, rejecting the appeal. It is now heard that Wang Jinfeng, on her personal side, will also present reasons and file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court, and confirm the identity of the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Zhang Deming, 26 years old this year, is the son of Zhang Jingan, owner of the Zhang Yande Hall medicinal materials shop at the intersection of Laohai Road and Nanjing Road in the Public Concession, and a native of Gaoqiao, Pudong. Seven years ago, he married Miss Zhou (the same age as Zhang), a native of Ningbo, through a matchmaker. They have a son named Yongji, who is five years old this year, and a daughter named Shundi, who is four years old this year. The couple's relationship was very harmonious at the beginning. They used to live at No. 3, Xixiang Lane, at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Qiale Road in the French Concession. The lane is a self-owned property. Recently, because Deming</p>
<p>frequents song and dance</p>
<p>venues, and has been doing so for three years, he thinks that Miss Zhou, although he has had her dressed up, is not as cute as fashionable girls, resulting in frequent quarrels. On April 14 of last year, another conflict broke out between the young couple. Deming pointed out that his wife, Miss Zhou, had taken the clothes at home to be pawned, so he beat her and threw her out of the house. Miss Zhou then returned to her mother's home at No. 15 Zhili Road. To this day, Deming has not gone to pick her up. Miss Zhou, because her husband</p>
<p>is unbearable to live with,</p>
<p>hired lawyer Xu Lin as her agent and filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Zhang Deming and his father, Zhang Jingan, for malicious abandonment and being unbearable to live with, requesting that the court order a separate residence for sixteen years and pay alimony calculated at 80 yuan per month, totaling 14,400 yuan for sixteen years. The children born should be supported by her, and her dowry should be returned. According to the lawsuit, the court opened the Civil Court Seven courtroom</p>
<p>to summon both parties</p>
<p>for trial yesterday morning. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit and the object of the request for judgment. The defendant's lawyer argued, objecting to the separate residence, and requesting that the court order the plaintiff to return home to live together. He also claimed that because the plaintiff had taken the clothes at home to be pawned, he questioned her about it, and the plaintiff herself returned to Ningbo and had no face to return. He requested that the court order her to live together, and that the defendant not give her living expenses or return the dowry. The plaintiff's lawyer then said that the plaintiff's</p>
<p>own dowry</p>
<p>is all red sandalwood, worth three or four thousand, why would she need to take the defendant's clothes to be pawned? What he said is unreasonable. The court then advised them to reconcile, asking the defendant to take the plaintiff home to live together and give her some guarantees, such as giving her some pocket money every month, etc. In the end, because they could not reconcile, the court ordered the lawyers of both parties to argue and then announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduled to be judged on the 21st.</p>

<p>Harsh methods should be severely punished. Wang Meirong, a Tongzhou native, has been working as a laborer in Shanghai. As the New Year approached, he and his fellow villager Yu Xiru went to Wharf 13 on the Bund at 1:00 PM yesterday, intending to board the De'an Steamer to return home. Wang Haihai, a member of the same clan, had previously requested a loan from Wang Meirong and was refused. Seizing the opportunity, he secretly hid two packets of heroin in Wang and Yu's luggage and reported it to Chinese Constable No. 3176 of the Central Police Station. The constable went to search and found two packets of drugs, taking them all back to the police station. After investigation by Chinese Constable Han Shoushan, the truth was discovered. Wang Haihai was arrested and taken to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court yesterday. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendant's behavior was extremely heinous. If the detective had not uncovered the truth, Yu and Wang would have been wrongly subjected to severe punishment. However, they are now unable to return home this year. Due to a minor feud, he attempted to have them suffer severe punishment. His methods were so malicious that they were appalling. He requested that Wang Haihai be temporarily detained for further investigation before prosecution. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Wang Haihai was remanded in custody for another week of interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Promoting Administrative Efficiency <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The work in the second phase of the War of Resistance, with administration being more important than military affairs, is indeed a insightful statement. The recent circular from the Executive Yuan to all agencies to organize "Committees for Promoting Administrative Efficiency" can be seen as proof of this statement.</p>
<p>In the past, we have had many shortcomings in administration, which are generally known to us, and there is no need to avoid mentioning them. Among them, the most common is procrastination, which has become a habit. It seems that everything is done half-heartedly, and we can just get by. It was not until the sound of the cannons on August 13th that this illusion was shattered, and the loopholes formed by these shortcomings were exposed. Now, the government is working hard to govern the country and is starting anew with the people, issuing such a circular, which truly fills us with boundless expectations. Because only with administrative efficiency can all government affairs be on track, the strength of the War of Resistance can be effectively increased, and we can stand in an invincible position.</p>
<p>This is true for the country, for groups, societies, and even families. Often, in a certain group, some members are not motivated, living a life of following the old ways, thinking that they can just sit back and enjoy the benefits. Once they encounter adversity or unexpected pressure, they become flustered and do not know what to do. If this group can work together and strive together, increasing administrative efficiency, this group will have the hope of revival; otherwise, the destruction of this group will inevitably become a tragic outcome.</p>
<p>However, the principle is like this, but what about the method? Of course, there are many methods, and we do not have time to list them all here. However, we can also have methodological principles as a standard for our progress. It is nothing else but to have organization, have planning, to adapt to the times, to assign people according to the job, to take advantage of opportunities… In short, everything must be thoroughly planned, and then divided into labor and cooperation, step by step, with everyone working at full speed. It is most important for everyone to have this determination, but it is even more important for everyone to have a certain method and a firm determination to follow this method. Otherwise, even with the desire to strive upward, it will still be a chaotic mess, with nothing to do, and what good will it do? The government's circular is also based on this principle.</p>
<p>Foreigners often say that we do not know organization and have no plans. Now our government has already shown something, washing away this shame. I wonder if the still scattered groups, societies, and even families, have been moved by this!</p>

<p>— Qianshan</p>
<p>"Ten thousand people like the sea, one person hidden!"</p>
<p>The thought of "hiding" brings a sour taste. Is it vinegar? Tears? The sourness of olives?</p>
<p>It is the self-esteem being whipped!—So mediocrely, hiding in a corner, sharing the feast of life. It is a feast, but also a sour and bitter wine! As if after a round of passing the cup, the taste of the wine has changed. Depleted, like worm-eaten; lonely, like dusk; indifferent, like emptiness, isolated, like another world. Surrounding me are laughter, crowds, animal roars, ghost cries… but what do these noises have to do with me? Hiding in a corner, sharing the feast of life, secretly chewing on others' wisdom and leftovers, others do not know me, but I do not know others.</p>
<p>As if the "Xiangji" studio were that big, hiding a heart that was once active but is now silent. Like throwing a light ball, throwing a person out of an old dream. As if Li Bing had a long sleep, and when he woke up, wiped his eyes, the scene had changed. Where can the old cranes of Liaodong recognize those cities and houses?</p>
<p>The generosity of singing loudly and making friends with young heroes on the field, Yuanlong's ambition to embrace the sea and lakes, no longer depends on the vicissitudes of the world. Tearing off the old noise, rubbing against today's solitude. Who says that the singing and music filling the sky are not joyful? Who says that there is no sound surrounding us? It is laughter, crowds, animal roars, ghost cries… but what do these noises have to do with me?</p>
<p>The noise of the city has nothing to do with me. Those laughter are also the groans of autumn insects! Corrupt bacteria are all over the city, surrounding me, making me tired, hateful, and hidden; but I can't forget the howls of jackals, the cries of thousands of families, and the chirping of ghosts in the cloudy and rainy weather… Who can pretend to be deaf and dumb? Although I am suffocating in a "Xiangji"-like room, a tiny mustard seed, my ears have grown thorns, and my back is covered with awns. The bitterness of "hiding" is already very cramped, but it cannot hide the sorrows of the world. I share the bitter wine of others while chewing on their wisdom and leftovers. It is a double sadness! Approaching, feeling, intertwined.</p>
<p>The raging fire, as smoke, as light, as heat, as a snake's tongue, as a dragon's beard, spreads in all directions, breaking through the eight cardinal points: how can a piece of thin paper hide it, causing the embers to become cold ash? Even if a pile of old dreams is pressing on me, I must break through those mists, that hazy mist!</p>
<p>The narrowness of a foal under a cart can no longer bear to stay in this small house. In the small house, there is only stupidity, confusion, fatigue, and meanness. The blood-red color of life is painted on the windows and under the eaves, and I cannot see the vast earth or the lives of the masses. How can I bear it?</p>
<p>With a magnificent mood, I look at the vastness, the high sky, the imagined "Southern Sea,"</p>
<p>The boundless "Southern Sea"! I want to fly!</p>

<p>— Cao Jurei</p>
<p>—Impressions from a Wartime Journey—</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Baili compared the Japanese nation to a character in a Shakespearean tragedy—Hamlet, which is a very appropriate analogy. The so-called tragic character is one who has several irreconcilable contradictions coexisting in their inner spirit. Contradictions are inherently inevitable, but there must be a force to turn other forces, to make relative harmony, instead of being completely opposed, which turns into internal forces rubbing against each other and even canceling each other out, and this becomes a great tragedy. In Plato's Republic, there is a passage about the myth of happiness, saying that an envoy gathered the spirits in hell and said to them:</p>
<p>Passing souls, you will begin a new journey, entering a mortal body. Your fate will not be chosen by the gods, but by yourselves. The order of selection will be determined by lottery. The first to be selected will choose first, but once selected, the fate is determined and cannot be changed... At that time, the envoy placed many bags in front of the souls, each containing a destiny, and each soul could take the one they hoped for. The first soul to be selected eagerly stepped forward, scrutinized a pile of impressive violence, and greedily and rashly took it away; later, when he searched through the remaining bags, he discovered that his destiny was to kill his own children and commit other great sins. He cried and raged, blaming the gods, blaming everything, and everything was cursed.</p>
<p>This short-sighted and reckless spirit can be said to be the Japanese nation.</p>
<p>History tells us that a nation's ambition and its greed cannot be reconciled; a nation with great greed cannot fulfill its ambition. Rome was a country with great ambition, and although it conquered many nations, it did not want to exterminate them. It assimilated and integrated, and thus achieved greatness. Spain and Portugal were both nations with great greed, and their colonial policy of killing the goose to get the golden eggs eventually led to the loss of most of their colonies. England adopted a more enlightened colonial policy, reducing greed, and its ambition of the First Empire was finally realized. The Tsarist Russia had very heavy greed, and its ambitions to advance south and east were both thwarted; the Soviet Russia abandoned its greed for invasion, and its great ambition to establish a proletarian democratic state was finally realized. These are all proofs.</p>
<p>Let's look at the Japanese nation again. On one side is a great ambition, as stated in the Tanaka Memorial, to establish an unprecedented great Asian empire, dividing the world into three parts; on the other side is a great greed, wanting to eat the 450 million Chinese people, skin and bones, into its stomach, and kick out the Eastern forces of European and American countries in one fell swoop; lacking the tolerance of the nomadic peoples, yet wanting to establish an empire even greater than the Roman Empire, this is called "not knowing one's own virtue, not measuring one's own strength."</p>
<p>When I and Ke Yun were with the army in southern Shandong, she heard the story of the Japanese army burning their own wounded soldiers alive, and her heart was pained by it. She said: "I seem to hear the enemy's wounded soldiers shouting in the flames!" I said that it was the reckless spirit who loved violence, his fate was destined to kill his own children! The character of the Japanese nation, in Buddhist terms, lacks some compassion. Mencius said: "To practice humane politics with a heart that cannot bear to see others suffer." The Japanese warlord politics is to practice inhumane politics with a heart that can bear to see others suffer, and we can conclude that its inevitable tragic ending is that its ambition is unfulfilled while its appetite is not filled, sacrificing the blood (economy) and flesh (life) of the Japanese people in vain.</p>

<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"Kill!" The command knife cut through the dark sky, leaving a silver arc, and fell to stab the enemy soldier hiding behind the tank. The enemy soldier seemed to have no experience in close combat, and only frantically used the rifle in his hand to parry. Regiment Commander Ye displayed the bayonet skills he had mastered in military school, and quickly stabbed three enemy soldiers to death. The remaining enemy soldiers, in a panic, dragged their guns and retreated. Seeing that the regiment commander had personally come out to charge, the soldiers engaged in close combat were so excited that they went mad. The enemy finally became timid and disheartened and could not hold on, and the entire line collapsed, and even those armored cars and tanks did not have time to retreat.</p>
<p>This was Regiment Commander Ye's first victory since he took command, completely stabilizing the defensive line at Wangjiangjing.</p>
<p>When Regiment Commander Ye returned to the original defense, he met Staff Officer Feng from the division headquarters.</p>
<p>"You are so brave!" Staff Officer Feng gave Regiment Commander Ye a thumbs up and said: "But you, like some officers, like to expose your whole body to the enemy without any cover, which is really not a good example to follow; you must know that the army values regimental and battalion commanders very much."</p>
<p>"I can't worry about that much." Regiment Commander Ye said with a smile: "As soon as I think of the country being bullied by foreign enemies, my heart burns like fire."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you some good news," Staff Officer Feng said triumphantly: "I just received a call from the front line that the enemy in Pinghu has been pressured by us and is showing signs of retreating. The Fengjing and Jiashan railway stations have been recaptured by us, and the crisis here can be said to be completely lifted."</p>
<p>"Really?" Regiment Commander Ye was so happy that he almost jumped up, as if the victory he had just won was not as pleasing as hearing this news.</p>
<p>However, this happiness did not last very long. In the following days, he was almost always in a state of disappointment, and alarms came one after another. Many places on the left and central wings were lost, and the entire defensive line was shaken. But the most important thing was on the right wing, where our army in Jiaxing only held out for two days. Because the enemy's artillery fire was too fierce, the city walls and fortifications were completely destroyed, and they had to withdraw in pain. After capturing Jiaxing, the enemy began to invade Wuzhen and Nanxun. Because Wangjiangjing was an important transportation hub by land and water, troops could be transported by water using motorboats to attack Nanxun's rear, so they were very active in attacking this route.</p>
<p>When the situation on the left and right wings was critical, the division to which Regiment Commander Ye belonged was ordered by the highest military authorities to withdraw west to Wuxing and Changxing along with the friendly forces defending in coordination. However, Regiment Commander Ye was still ordered to undertake the task of covering the retreat, using his regiment of troops to defend to the death the last stronghold on this defensive line. This task of covering the retreat was concretely completed.</p>
<p>But Regiment Commander Ye's regiment of troops became an isolated force. At first, the division headquarters kept calling military telephones, urging them to retreat quickly, but then there was suddenly no news, indicating that new changes had taken place in the battle situation in Wuzhen and Nanxun, and the military telephones had been destroyed, so their communication with the rear was completely cut off.</p>
<p>But Regiment Commander Ye's firm will enabled him to refuse to withdraw from this last position even in the midst of great difficulties, even though the troops no longer had heavy artillery and could only use rifles, machine guns, and small mortars to confront the enemy's fierce artillery fire.</p>
<p>In the complex harmony of artillery, bombs, light and heavy machine guns, and volleys, the messenger ran breathlessly, like a dazed man, to report the news:</p>
<p>"Report to the regimental commander, the seventh company has only twelve people left, what should we do?"</p>
<p>"Go! Go! Tell them that even if there is only one person left, they must defend to the death." Regiment Commander Ye waved his hand, stubbornly said. He stood凛然 in the smoke and rain of bullets, his square face, as if cast in pig iron. (15)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Organ Therapy Invented Long Ago in China (1) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yenong</p>
<p>Westerners and Europeans have always regarded animal organs as discarded items, and they despise eating them because they think they are unsanitary. Since the invention of organ therapy, the world has re-evaluated them. China has actually invented their usefulness for a long time. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>Pig Spleen (commonly known as belly), can be purchased from various meat shops in the market at low prices. This item is a particularly effective medicine for infantile malnutrition. The spleen and stomach of children are weak, and the digestive power is not strong. Overeating or eating too many snacks causes food to accumulate in the stomach and intestines, hindering the peristalsis of the spleen, stomach, and intestinal walls, losing the ability to decompose, and causing indigestion, turning into malnutrition. The common saying is "Only eating rice, not growing meat, a living food bag is in a dead spleen," which describes its ability to eat but not digest. Pig spleen can strengthen the spleen and stomach, remove accumulation and guide stagnation, and assist digestion, so it has special effects in treating this disease. When malnutrition reaches a critical stage, there are generally two different symptoms: the abdomen is swollen, the muscles are emaciated, there is tidal fever, the mouth is dry, the tongue is smooth and red, there are night sweats and restlessness; loose stools, a pale face, rapid breathing, sunken eyes, emaciated body, and mental exhaustion. Although pig spleen can treat both diseases, it is necessary to add different medications depending on the disease.</p>
<p>First, purchase fresh pig spleen from the butcher, wash it, cut a few strips with a knife, put it in a ceramic pot, and then mix the medicinal powder on the spleen.——For the first type of symptom, use Zhuer ginseng powder. For the second type of symptom, use gallnut powder. (Available in pharmacies, they can grind it into powder for you).——Then steam it on a rice cooker, cut it into small pieces, stop the patient from eating other food, and eat the pig spleen when hungry until cured. This method has been repeatedly tried and repeatedly tested.</p>
<p>Pig and Sheep Testicles: In addition to congenital heredity, impotence is mostly caused by excessive sexual desire and kidney deficiency. The treatment should nourish yin to help yang, and not use stimulants to strengthen yang and damage yin. Western methods take endocrine secretions from a certain part of animals and inject them into a certain part of the human body. National doctors use pig and sheep testicles to treat it, both with the same meaning. Slaughter and take pig and sheep testicles, soak them in rice wine for several hours, and squeeze the juice to drink; if you do not cook it, you may lose its effective ingredients. There is also a method of grinding white lotus seeds into powder and mixing them with pig and sheep spinal cord to make pills, taking forty pills a day, which can also replenish essence and strengthen the kidneys.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Deer Antler and Kelp <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jieren</p>
<p>Deer antler is a well-known tonic in our country. It is commonly believed that anyone with a weak body can purchase and take it, but its nature is warm and pure yang, which can generate essence, replenish marrow, strengthen muscles and bones, and treat all kinds of deficiency and labor damage. It is extremely effective for those with weak pulses and declining fire, and it is a good product for treating neurasthenia. If people with phlegm and fire take it, it will not only not help the disease, but it will also be harmful. It is like holding firewood to put out a fire, so you must first consult a doctor to avoid any problems.</p>
<p>Kelp is a marine food, which has been used for medicinal purposes in our country since ancient times. For example, the Classic of Materia Medica says: "Kelp mainly treats goiter, qi stagnation, and dissipates hard masses under the neck." Another famous doctor, Bie Lu, said: "Kelp treats masses under the skin, rapid swelling, lumps of qi and heat, promotes urination, etc." This is all because it contains the most iodine, and iodine is especially effective for goiter, scrofula, malignant sores, etc. Recently, many people have used it as a raw material for making iodine, so those who suffer from scrofula often cook tea and eat it, which has a miraculous effect of clearing blood, removing toxins, and changing the constitution.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Children's Food: What to Eat and What to Avoid <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Tuo</p>
<p>As the saying goes: If you want your child to be safe, always keep them slightly hungry and cold. This is because if children overeat, they often develop food stagnation in their stomachs, which can easily affect their health.</p>
<p>Children over two years old should eat four meals a day, and after each meal, eat a small amount of fruits such as apples, oranges, Asian pears, and sugar cane to moisten the intestines and stomach and aid digestion. Children over ten years old should eat three meals a day and have a light snack in the afternoon to stave off hunger. As for foods that are generally suitable for children, they include eggs, vegetables, beef broth, chicken broth, milk, fish, meat, and bread. This is because these foods are rich in nutrients, which can fully regulate various parts of the child's body, are easy to digest, and do not cause food stagnation.</p>
<p>The most important things to avoid for children are snacking after meals and eating late-night snacks, to prevent malnutrition. Children should not be picky eaters. Many children like to eat sweets, peanuts, beans, raw yams, sesame seeds, and the like, not knowing that sweets easily cause fermentation in the stomach and hinder digestion; peanuts, if not chewed carefully, will accumulate in the intestines and stomach, harming health; beans, yams, and sesame seeds congest the respiratory tract, and eating too much can cause abdominal distension. All of these are harmful to health, and parents should pay close attention to them.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Tofu and Green Vegetables <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jintao</p>
<p>Tofu is rich in protein, making it the "meat" of the plant world, with the same effects as eggs and beef; however, eggs can sometimes help revive bacteria, and beef can sometimes cause excessive fat accumulation, whereas tofu has no such drawbacks. Bean sprouts are a top-quality tonic for the heart and also help the kidneys filter waste. People with heart disease or urinary problems should drink soup made from bean sprouts.</p>
<p>Other foods such as green vegetables can promote lung respiration and cleanse residual stains; radishes can promote the movement of the spleen and stomach and digest accumulated food. Those who eat meat should often eat these foods to balance their diet. We are all familiar with their taste and consider them everyday foods; however, we may not know that regulating the internal organs, nourishing the essence of life, increasing antitoxins, and resisting disease are all functions found in these plants. Therefore, we should not look down on them just because they are cheap.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Introduction to Six Tonics (Part Two) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>

<p>Mutton Porridge: Preparation: Take four ounces each of mutton and yam, boil until tender, mash them, add rice, and cook into porridge. Mutton can replenish vitality and boost energy. When paired with yam, which nourishes and strengthens the stomach, it can replace the evening meal for the elderly, providing not only delicious flavor but also nourishment. Five-Wonder Soup: Preparation: Take one bowl of bean juice (tofu whey), one cup of dried longan pulp (guiyuan), pour in one raw egg while hot (beaten lightly), one piece of broad tangerine peel, and one ounce of white sugar. It is well known that bean juice and eggs are rich in nutrients. Longan pulp nourishes the heart and calms the mind, while tangerine peel regulates qi and stimulates the appetite. Therefore, this soup is not only effective for indigestion but also a good friend for those with neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Spleen-Strengthening Cakes: Preparation: Take half a pound of cooked jujube pulp, four ounces of white atractylodes, and two ounces each of dried chicken gizzard lining and dried ginger. First, grind the white atractylodes and chicken gizzard lining into a fine powder and bake until cooked. Then, grind the dried ginger into a powder and mix it with the jujube pulp, pounding it into a paste. Make small cakes and dry them over a charcoal fire. These cakes are beneficial to the intestines and stomach for healthy people. Those with indigestion, diarrhea, or constipation will find that they stop diarrhea and improve appetite. They are especially suitable for children. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Olives for Throat Ailments <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Xiwen</p>
<p>The throat occupies an extremely important position in human physiology. If we consider that our survival in the world depends on breathing and the transportation of food and drink, both of which rely on the throat, we can call it the gateway for breathing and food intake. Once breathing is obstructed or food and water cannot enter, life is in danger. This shows that although the throat is only the size of a bullet, its importance is related to the safety of life.</p>
<p>Below the uvula (named Diding) in the throat is a small cavity, with the pharynx on the left and the larynx on the right. The pharynx leads to the stomach, serving as the esophagus to transport food and water; the larynx leads to the lungs, governing breathing. Generally, throat ailments are often caused by excessive dryness in the climate, a preference for spicy foods, the accumulation of wind and fire, and the accumulation of heat and phlegm in the lungs and stomach. However, if we classify them by category, there are many types of throat ailments, each with its own cause. For example, diphtheria, scarlet fever, throat rash, acute laryngitis, gangrenous stomatitis, and thrush are all extremely dangerous diseases. Patients should not ignore them. Once they are discovered, they should seek treatment from a good doctor immediately, and not delay, lest they become incurable. This is because these dangerous ailments can change in an instant.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that olives are a refreshing and delicious snack, but they have a "hundred benefits and no drawbacks" for the throat. According to the "Compendium of Materia Medica," olives, also known as "admonishing fruit," are sour, sweet, warm, and non-toxic in nature. They open the stomach, lower qi, generate fluids, quench thirst, and treat sore throats. Chewing and swallowing the juice can relieve all fish and turtle poisoning. From this, we know that olives are indeed a most beneficial fruit for us. Olives not only treat sore throats and other ailments, but also, when throat rash is rampant, chewing a few olives daily or decocting six or seven olives in soup as tea can prevent infection. Especially during the severe winter months, families with coal stoves can often eat a few olives or hold them in their mouths to avoid coal poisoning and reduce throat dryness.</p>
<p>Plasters, Pills, and Powders</p>
<h3 id="e86">Good Sleep Medicine <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Jihua</p>
<p>Occasional insomnia a few times a month is not a disease. But when occasional insomnia becomes a habit, and the habit leads to various symptoms such as headaches, heart palpitations, stomach upset, constipation, and memory loss, it becomes a disease. Patients with this disease are generally weak. Physical weakness leads to anxiety, which leads to insomnia. And the more insomnia, the weaker the body becomes, resulting in extreme suffering. Those with mild cases can barely cope, while those with severe cases must take over-the-counter sleeping pills for temporary relief. Here are some domestically produced good sleep medicines that are easy to take and truly effective:</p>
<p>Zhu Sha An Shen Wan (Cinnabar Calming Pill): This pill is specifically for treating restlessness, headaches, constipation, and insomnia caused by excessive heart and liver fire. Take fifteen pills with warm water before going to bed. Stop taking the medicine once you recover.</p>
<p>Hu Po Duo Mei Wan (Amber Dream-Enhancing Pill): This pill is specifically for treating insufficient heart blood, deficiency of kidney qi, heart palpitations, memory loss, restless sleep, and insomnia due to mental confusion. Two hours before going to bed, take five fen each time with a decoction of rush pith. Continue until you recover.</p>
<p>Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan (Emperor of Heaven Heart-Nourishing Pill): This pill is specifically for treating excessive worrying, insufficient heart blood, heart palpitations, forgetfulness, alternating constipation and diarrhea, and frequent insomnia. Take two qian each time with a decoction of longan pulp. The timing is not restricted. Additionally, the Xiu Nao An Shui Wan (Sleeve Brain Sleep-Aid Pill) from the Beiping Pharmacy is also effective. Patients can first ask the Chinese medicine store for the leaflets of these three types of pills, carefully review them, and choose the one that suits their condition.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Yam Cake <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Sansi</p>
<p>Yam can replenish vitality. Regular consumption strengthens energy, strengthens bones, and has the effect of nourishing essence. Northern people like to eat it. There are many types, but those that are cylindrical in shape and reddish in skin are not good. Those that are flat and white are Huai yam, which has the greatest nourishing power. However, boiling or steaming it in plain water makes it slightly astringent and numb. It is better to make yam puree, which is easier to eat. But the best-tasting is yam cake. Here are the detailed steps: First, steam the yam until cooked, peel it, and let it cool completely. Add glutinous rice flour (only one-third the amount of yam), white sugar, and raw lard, etc., and grind it in a stone mortar until well mixed. Then spread it into a rectangular iron plate and steam it in a steamer. Use a knife to cut it into rectangular pieces. If you want a fragrant flavor, you can add osmanthus sugar, which will make it fragrant, sweet, and no longer astringent or numb. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and deficiency syndrome can eat several pieces daily to increase the body's resistance and satisfy their hunger.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Notes on Dietary Therapy <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Many people have submitted articles on dietary therapy, and the number of manuscripts is piling up. Due to space constraints, we cannot publish the full text of each one. Therefore, we have opened this column to collect the essence. Although it may be just fragments, they are based on experienced discussions, which we believe readers will enjoy.</p>
<p>Wax Gourd Juice for Treating Edema</p>
<p>Take a wax gourd, cut off the top at the stem, scoop out all the seeds, and add one pound of rock sugar. Replace the top and roast it over a charcoal stove until the gourd flesh turns into water and the rock sugar melts completely. Slowly drink the liquid. It can treat edema after illness. Mild cases can be cured with one dose, and severe cases will be cured with three doses.</p>
<p>— (Liu Minshu)</p>
<p>Sea Cucumber is Beneficial for Women</p>
<p>Often cook sea cucumber with ham instead of other dishes. Pregnant women will have less risk of difficult labor, and those with irregular menstruation can gradually return to normal. Eating it after childbirth greatly replenishes qi and blood.</p>
<p>— (Shen Lin)</p>
<p>Peanuts Treat Jaundice and Edema</p>
<p>Peanuts are pungent and fragrant in nature, and can promote qi circulation. Therefore, those with jaundice and edema caused by poor yang qi circulation and water retention can eat more peanuts, up to two pounds.</p>
<p>— (Yu Sheng)</p>
<p>Hawthorn Powder Cures Dysentery</p>
<p>Mix one ounce of hawthorn powder (i.e., hawthorn charcoal ground into powder) with a certain amount of brown sugar and cook it into a thick tea. Drinking it can cure dysentery. This is because hawthorn has the effect of digesting food stagnation and removing greasy dirt, while brown sugar has the effect of removing accumulation and generating new qi. Using it to treat dysentery is easy to achieve results.</p>
<p>— (Zhou Jintao)</p>
<p>Dietary Therapy for Beriberi</p>
<p>Patients with beriberi should not only immediately switch to eating brown rice that has not been excessively milled, but also eat more peanuts, soybeans, peas, fresh vegetables, and orange juice to increase nutrients in the body.</p>
<p>— (Yao Ruoqin)</p>
<p>Ham for Deficiency Syndromes</p>
<p>Ham is sweet, salty, warm, and beneficial for the spleen and stomach, and can replenish qi and blood. Wash the whole piece clean, place it in a large bowl, and steam it over the rice cooker six or seven times until it is extremely tender. Then eat it to treat deficiency syndromes. Alternatively, boil it into a soup, skim off the oil, and only drink the broth.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Progression of Typhoid Fever and Dietary Program (VII) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>B. Starting from the Fifth Day After the Fever Subsides in Typhoid Fever</p>
<p>In terms of food, four more items can be added: bread, scorched rice porridge, dongshuang rice porridge, and thin rice porridge. In terms of beverages, two more items can be added: beef broth and young chicken broth.</p>
<p>In terms of dishes, the following can be paired with meals: vegetable soup, Shaoxing dried vegetable soup, spinach and egg white soup, tomato soup, egg drop soup, duck soup, chicken blood soup, spinach and pork liver soup, chicken soup, and loofah soup. Items that can be eaten without restriction include: wax gourd, gluten, yam, baked gluten, ham, meat floss, dried cabbage, dried vegetable shoots, bamboo shoot tips, shiitake mushrooms, tofu skin, bean curd sheets, macaroni, broad beans, and various pickles.</p>
<p>The above list is quite extensive, allowing patients to switch and choose. However, it is still not advisable to eat too much. You can decide on the number of items, but the amount should not be excessive. From the tenth day onwards, you can eat thicker rice porridge, and from the fifteenth day onwards, you can eat soft rice (such as aged rice, dongshuang rice, and fragrant japonica rice). The dates listed above should be adjusted depending on the severity of the illness. However, the order of porridge and rice must follow this sequence. Eating rice too early can easily cause a relapse. After illness, fluids rich in nutrients and easy to digest are most suitable. Therefore, after typhoid fever, chicken broth and beef broth, although meat products, are essential for nourishing the body. (End of entire article)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Winter Bamboo Shoot and Crucian Carp Soup for Promoting Measles Eruption <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Bowei</p>
<p>Winter bamboo shoot and crucian carp soup is a delicious dish and an excellent remedy for promoting measles eruption. As the weather is currently unfavorable and smallpox is prevalent, I am writing this article to share this remedy.</p>
<p>Winter bamboo shoots have a sweet, cold taste, and are mainly used to treat children's measles that do not erupt. They can also detoxify and have the power to promote eruption, as detailed in the "Compendium of Materia Medica." Crucian carp is sweet and warm, and can regulate the middle burner and benefit the five internal organs. The "Inner Classic" states that fish can cause internal heat. All measles cases must be warmed to promote pus formation. The properties of the two ingredients are perfectly compatible.</p>
<p>When cooking, take crucian carp, remove the internal organs, and wash it clean. Cut winter bamboo shoots into slices, add water, and simmer lightly (do not add salt, fermented soybeans, or scallions). Drink the soup frequently, but only during the pus-formation period. It is not a suitable drink for long-term consumption. Also, bamboo shoots have the drawback of lubricating the large intestine, which is not beneficial for the spleen. Therefore, those with loose stools should avoid them.</p>
<p>This is one of the folk remedies. Recently, many doctors have also adopted it to assist medication, and many use bamboo shoot slices alone in prescriptions.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Financial Tianjin and Hong Kong Gangs Jointly Pursue, Gold Price Breaks New Record - Two Thousand and Seventy-Five Yuan - Limited Number of Circulating Chips in This City - How Can It Withstand Unlimited Attraction <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market in this city, although the foreign exchange potential was quite flat, suddenly experienced a surprising surge, leaping straight up, successively exceeding the two major thresholds of two thousand and sixty and seventy yuan, breaking the previous record of two thousand and sixty-eight yuan on November 28 of last year, appearing at an unprecedented peak of two thousand and seventy-five yuan. The morale of all parties is surprisingly strong, due to the limited number of circulating chips in this city, being relentlessly pursued by a certain jewelry store and cash house (representing the Hong Kong gang) and a certain gang and currency exchange (representing the Tianjin gang) regardless of the high price. Therefore, although a certain gold store and other jewelry stores and two other currency exchanges sold after the price increase satisfied them, the upward momentum was difficult to stop slightly, akin to adding fuel to the fire, leading to a trend of difficult return, finally seeing a sharp increase of seventeen yuan. Due to the small number of sellers, the overall daily transaction was not very prosperous, only eight hundred and fifty taels. Jewelry gold also rose to an unprecedented high price of two yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold, etc., slightly rebounded.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises Sharply by Seventeen Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially opened because the buying interest of various guest gangs was quite strong, bid to buy at two thousand and fifty-seven or eight yuan, but sellers wanted sixty yuan before they were willing to supply, so it took a long time to open. Until 9:50, the northern gang bought fifty taels from the jewelry store gang, with the opening price of two thousand and fifty-nine yuan, three yuan higher than the previous day. After opening, a certain gold store suddenly absorbed purchases on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, buying fifty taels from the jewelry store gang, priced at sixty yuan. Later, the northern gang also bought fifty taels from the gold store, with the same price. Following that, the same price was seen when a certain jewelry store also searched for purchases on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, buying fifty taels from a certain currency exchange. After the currency exchange sold, it strongly held back two hundred taels, with the price still at sixty yuan. Then, a certain gold store absorbed one hundred taels on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, and the jewelry store gang and currency exchange each absorbed fifty taels. It was heard that the seller sold what was bought from the retail department. After that, another currency exchange suddenly searched for purchases on behalf of the Tianjin gang, buying fifty taels from a fellow trader, priced at sixty-one yuan. Later, the gold store also absorbed fifty taels from the jewelry store gang, with the price also at sixty-one yuan. Soon after, a certain jewelry store again bought fifty taels from a fellow trader on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, with the price still at sixty-one yuan. Subsequently, it stabilized for a while. Until near noon, a certain currency exchange continued to search for purchases on behalf of the Tianjin gang, but at that time, sellers were extremely scarce, and the buyers had no choice but to buy at a high price, causing the price to jump by several yuan. A certain currency exchange bought fifty taels from the gold store, making sixty-seven yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, although the foreign exchange was still flat, the Hong Kong gang searched even harder, and there was a lack of sellers, so the price soared. Initially, a certain gold store bought fifty taels from a fellow trader on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, priced at sixty-seven yuan. Later, a certain currency exchange bought fifty taels from the jewelry store gang, priced at seventy yuan. After that, sellers became even scarcer, and a certain gold store bought fifty taels from a currency exchange again, priced at seventy-four yuan. Then, it bought fifty taels from a currency exchange again, with seventy-five yuan as the new peak. After that, because retail investors sold for profit, the rise stopped and flattened. The currency exchange sold fifty taels to a certain gold store, with two thousand and seventy-three yuan as the closing price, a sharp increase of seventeen yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of sixteen yuan throughout the day. The company's own brand gold was sold at two thousand and eighty yuan, and bought in at two thousand and sixty-five yuan. The current standard gold is hung at fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, all without any trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Suspended at Two Hundred and Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was initially unchanged. Until 11:10, due to the firm potential of spot gold, it was also raised by one yuan. Then, at 3:30 in the afternoon, due to the intensified rise of spot gold, it was raised by one yuan again. Datonghang, Lao Qingyun, and others changed the suspension to two hundred and ten yuan. Xinhanghang suspended at two hundred and eight yuan, and bought in at two hundred and two yuan, all creating an unprecedented new peak in the jewelry gold exchange rate.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Recovers Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 15th: British pure gold also rebounded by half a penny per ounce due to the weakening of the British pound, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and four pence. As a result, the People's Bank of China's cash purchase price also rose to one thousand two hundred and ten yuan and nine jiao. The listed customs gold remained unchanged, still at two yuan, three jiao, nine fen, and four li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by three jiao, totaling one thousand two hundred and six yuan and two jiao.</p>
<p>Large Bars Near the Long-Term Flat</p>
<p>London, 15th: Speculators bought and sold, with few transactions, and the market was calm. After closing, it was still flat, with a few purchases at the listed price. The recent return of large silver bars was up by 0.0625, and the long-term was unchanged. New York silver telegraph: The price of American silver remained unchanged. Also, Bombay silver telegraph: The Indian silver market was calm, and the spot price and the near and far terms remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply with Gold Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.1875. Foreign exchange settlements were slightly active. The Tianjin foreign bank had a slight search for purchases. Hong Kong telegraph supply was smooth. The banks' intention to sell was weak. Spot gold opened steadily. Subsequently, the Tianjin gang and the jewelry industry started searching for purchases, and the end of the lunar year was approaching, and those lacking positions urgently needed to offset them, causing the market price to gradually soar. Foreign currencies rose sharply with the price of gold. British-American gold pounds rose sharply. American bills and Hong Kong bills were accepted by foreign banks. All gangs tended to rise. The transaction of Japanese bills and Korean bills was very active. The association's transactions were extremely rare, with only Yongtai issuing Chengtai's American bills for two thousand yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British-American gold pounds each rose by three jiao and five fen, British gold bills rose by seven fen, American gold bills rose by one fen and eight li, Hong Kong bills rose by eight li, French francs rose by half a li, Singapore bills rose by one fen, Annam bills rose by two fen, Philippine bills rose by one fen, and all other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Although the Buying Wind is Fierce, the Sale is Also Strong, the British and American Exchange Markets have No Difference <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Exchange Market yesterday, with the advantage of the bank, was vigorously supporting the North China Foreign Trade Bank, and foreign firms also had some settlements. Moreover, foreign banks (except HSBC) also tracked the settlements. Fortunately, the supply of foreign telegrams and HSBC and Sassoon Wa Hang, etc., maintained a relatively stable potential, and transactions were still active. As for the Hong Kong exchange, because the currency exchange's intention to sell was not strong, and the appetite of various foreign banks was good, the market situation was slightly tight.</p>
<p>In the morning, initially, the recent return of London's large bars was up by 0.0625, the long-term was unchanged, and the New York silver price was also unchanged. London's raw gold rebounded by half a penny, the exchange rate of British to American shrank by one li and nine, to France by a small two dinars, and to Shanghai as before. The US to British fell by 0.1875, to France was flat, and to Shanghai fell by five fen. The central listing exchange rates were fixed as before. The banks' morning opening selling price was eight pennies one two five for the British exchange and fifteen yuan eight seven five for the American exchange. Compared with the previous close, the British and American exchanges had no difference. After opening, the favorable still supported the North China Foreign Trade Bank, but fortunately, HSBC was willing to supply, resulting in little change. The Silver Equilibrium Tax was announced to rise by half a cent, totaling slightly 7.50 percent. After that, the favorable came to purchase settlements again, and foreign firms and foreign banks also tracked settlements, so the situation suddenly became tight. The softest British gold shouted over eight pennies one zero nine three seven five, and the tightest American exchange also shouted over fifteen yuan eight four three seven five. At that time, fortunately, the Hong Kong Telegraph, HSBC, and Wah Hang came to maintain, so the potential immediately turned flat. Hong Kong Telegraph Wah Hang HSBC sold to favorable, foreign firms, Dutch, Hua Yi, Hua Bi British gold eight pennies one two five, and American exchange fifteen yuan eight seven five. Near noon, Anda and Hua Yi absorbed the currency exchange's Hong Kong exchange from fifty-four yuan and a half shrank to three seven five, resulting in a slightly tight potential. In the afternoon, the bank's selling price was eight pennies one two five for British gold and fifteen yuan eight seven five for American exchange.</p>
<p>In the latter market, although favorable and foreign banks still came to purchase, the supply of Bombay, Sassoon, and HSBC kept the situation unchanged. Bombay Sassoon HSBC sold to favorable, Hua Bi, and Dutch British gold eight pennies one two five, and American exchange fifteen yuan eight seven five. After entering, the Dutch ate the currency exchange's Hong Kong exchange at fifty-four yuan three seven five, resulting in a flat process. The evening closing bank selling prices, both British and American exchanges, had no honor or disgrace compared with the previous close, while the Hong Kong exchange was slightly softer one two five.</p>

<p>London Chinese foreign debt, the listed market on the 15th of this month (Wednesday), only the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Public Debt rebounded by one pound, with a price of twenty pounds, and the rest were flat without any change. The London physical supply was only one pen of Sino-French American five percent public debt with no printed debt ticket, totaling one thousand six hundred and fifty pounds (that is, eight thousand two hundred and fifty US dollars), with a selling price of sixty-seven pounds two shillings and sixpence, a drop of seven shillings and sixpence compared with yesterday's close.</p>
<p>London British-owned Far East companies' stock listed market on the 15th of this month (Wednesday), the ups and downs were very limited.

<p>Between 1931 and 1936, the British-American Tobacco Company Limited paid an annual net dividend of ordinary shares (dividends exempt from income tax) of two cents per annum. In 1937, it increased by one cent and two and a half mils, totaling two cents, one cent, and two and a half mils. In 1938, it was reduced to two cents per annum. It was found that the net profit for this year (one year from October 1, 1937, to the end of September 1938) was £5,590,886, a slight decrease compared to the previous year's surplus of £5,760,480. However, this year's surplus deducted a national defense donation, and the income tax also increased to five shillings and sixpence per pound. The loss of taxation caused a net profit reduction of £169,600. The company's operating records for the past three years are listed below (unit: pounds).</p>
<h3 id="e95">Cotton Yarn, Cotton Yarn Hoarders Continue to Increase Their Stakes, the Market Jumps Again by More Than Three Yuan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Yarn Market continued to move forward, and the sentiment of rising momentum was increasingly strong. Although the customer gangs' business had no wholesale transactions, sporadic purchases in the corner of South China continued non-stop. At the same time, the demand for northern coarse yarn followed. The hearts of the people are soaring. The hoarders' intentions are still strong. Not only is the amount of absorption not returned, but it is seen that it will be dragged in again. Therefore, the current spot gold chips in the market feel dry. A peak of over four hundred and six yuan was seen again. After the raw material price rose, the general floating buyers took the opportunity to emerge, mostly holding the principle of making money in hand. It is worth the urgent scenery declining year, the market will stop the market from today, and will resume normal opening business until February 23.</p>
<p>The situation of the current yarn, at the beginning of the morning opening, inherited the strong and expensive atmosphere of the previous day and continued to rise, and although buyers were not very crowded, the holders asked for high prices, so it took a long time to open the market, increasing the price by three yuan. The price of 20s Double Horse was four hundred and five yuan, with ten packages traded among peers. After a short while, it rose by one yuan, to four hundred and six yuan. The peers and hoarders' purchases were still not weak, and the market sentiment was extremely firm. Halfway through, those who made a profit slightly frustrated the settlement. As a result, the total number of transactions in the morning was one thousand four hundred and eighty-five packages, and the number of transactions in the afternoon of the previous day was two hundred and sixty packages, totaling one thousand seven hundred and forty-five packages. The market price of 20s Double Horse rose by one and a half yuan, the special Jin Cheng rose by three and a half yuan, Tian Nu rose by three and a half yuan, and Shuang Di Qiu rose by four yuan. 10s coarse yarn was also firm. The factory opened out 5 packages of 20s special Jin Cheng from Yong'an Factory, priced at four hundred yuan, and the current deposit slips. Yesterday, one hundred and five pieces of cotton yarn and seventy pieces of cotton cloth were shipped from Qinglong Port. Today, another 30 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Tianjin, and 25 pieces will be shipped to Yantai, and 22 pieces of piece goods will be shipped directly to Yantai. The amount purchased by various gangs is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Drastic Drop in Indian Cotton Prices Causes Concerns for Factories <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Overseas, the cotton market prices and the New York cotton market are unusually quiet. Initially, this was due to telegrams from Bombay and Liverpool indicating slight price drops. Indian brokers were also selling off in the market. Businesses are holding a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting the development of the Smith proposal. Yesterday, New York fell by 2 to 9 points. In India, due to the sluggish stock market and mass selling by brokers, the cotton market plummeted by 3 rupees. Egypt also dropped by over 10 points. Yesterday's exchange rates were relatively stable, but even when converted to legal tender, cotton prices still fell. American and Brazilian cotton each dropped by over 40 cents per dan (a unit of weight), Indian cotton fell by over one yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 2.1 yuan.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, overseas cotton trading saw a new low price since October due to the drastic fall in Indian cotton prices. Factories, recognizing the low cotton prices, made some purchases. New Yu bought 500 bales, and orders were also placed for various grades. Yu Feng, a Japanese factory, also purchased 1,750 bales of Brazilian cotton. Overseas cotton trading is spicing up the end of the year, making it quite lively. It is expected that next year's market will open strong, leading to even more vigorous trading.</p>

<p>Yesterday, woolen cloth trading was mostly halted as businesses were busy with year-end closing. Upon review of the year 1927, most businesses reported profits. The volume of business was not lower than in previous years. Some businesses specializing in local retail sales even saw more prosperous business. It is reported that the business with the highest annual turnover reached 1.56 to 1.6 million yuan, while the lowest was around 50,000 yuan. The highest profits reached about 110,000 to 120,000 yuan.</p>

<p>A batch of 10,000 bags of Dutch raw white sugar that arrived in Amoy was originally intended to be transshipped to Shanghai to reduce taxes. Yesterday, it was learned that Amoy suddenly could not allow transshipment. Telegrams have already been sent to Amoy, instructing them to ship directly to Shanghai. While this measure may slightly reduce costs, it clearly contradicts the principle of transparency in the sugar industry. It seems that a clear distinction should be made in the future to maintain the historically strict standards.</p>

<p>The market for bitter almonds was previously sluggish, selling for only 31 to 32 yuan per dan. Recently, brokers from Hong Kong and Shantou have been actively seeking them, and a batch has been sold and already shipped. The goods are of mid-range quality, priced at 34 to 35 yuan. However, those seeking higher-grade almonds are willing to pay 38 yuan. It is reported that a certain firm has over ten pieces in stock, asking as high as 42 yuan, but no agreement has been reached. However, due to a lack of supply, they are expected to become popular.</p>

<p>The white coal market continues to rise sharply, with prices showing a sharp upward trend. Market sentiment is firm as users rush to purchase and store coal before the end of the lunar year. Supply at stores is insufficient to meet demand, leading to a genuine price increase. Sourcing coal is particularly urgent, causing suppliers to unilaterally raise prices. Yesterday, a certain firm offered Hongji white coal with a further increase of two yuan. The total price for lump coal is 47 yuan per ton, screened lump coal is 49 yuan, and graded lump coal is 51 yuan. Customers picking up from the warehouse will be charged extra, according to the trade.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Laurel and Hardy with Hitler and Mussolini <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Yuquan</p>
<p>I happened to see a cartoon in a pictorial magazine, depicting the comical faces of Laurel and Hardy, and below them, caricatures of Mussolini and Hitler, one fat and one thin, equally amusing. Beside the drawing were the words: "There are two pairs of Laurel and Hardy in the world. One pair in Hollywood is about to break up. Guess who the other pair is? Should they break up too?"</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy are arguably a classic duo. They are leading comedy stars in Hollywood, beloved by movie fans worldwide. But if there's Laurel without Hardy, or Hardy without Laurel, it's a solo act, lacking the interplay, and the resulting performance will not be as enjoyable. These two should be inseparable. I wonder why they would break up, which is a shame for the fans. It's the so-called principle of "what comes together must fall apart".</p>
<p>As for Hitler and Mussolini as a pair, no need to say, they will naturally put on an amazing show. The only fear is that they cannot escape the fate of "what comes together must fall apart". Just like Laurel and Hardy, they won't maintain their friendship forever and will end up breaking up. That won't have any appeal at all. Who knows if they're destined to have the same fate as Laurel and Hardy.</p>
<p>I recall that a local cinema showed "Sons of the Desert", starring Laurel and Hardy. In the film, Laurel and Hardy are both unsuccessful pickpockets, and are often in conflict over the division of stolen goods, ultimately being arrested and punished. Both of them end up looking strange and ridiculous. This is similar to what Mussolini and Hitler are doing because they also want to stuff the entire "universe" into their own sleeves! But these two are insatiable. When it comes to dividing spoils, who would be willing to give up even a little? Perhaps a third party is "working hard" on the side. If that happens, everyone will become impolite and disregard the "non-aggression" pact. At that time, even "breaking up" won't solve everything. They might fight to the death and end up perishing together.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Mulan Joins the Army <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Baihua</p>
<p>(I) The Attitude Towards Producing Historical Films</p>
<p>Using historical (or folk) stories as film material has become a new path for domestic films in the current "isolated island". Already released films include "Diao Chan" and "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian." Now, three new works are being released simultaneously: Guohua's "Meng Jiang Nu," Yihua's "Xiang Yu the Conqueror," and Huacheng's "Mulan Joins the Army." The development of this new trend seems to have attracted the attention of domestic film audiences: "Why produce historical films?" I seem to have heard this concerned question.</p>
<p>At a time when the enemy is deliberately attacking the Chinese film industry, and the objective environment is so strictly limiting, how should we break a path out of the oppression of hardship and use the "weapon" of film and the responsibilities that this "weapon" requires us to undertake? This is indeed a serious issue worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In recent times, every member engaged in the film industry has clearly seen our current crisis. Therefore, producing historical films is definitely not avoiding responsibility. However, the only attitude that should be adopted when producing historical films is not simply to copy the antique charm and moving stories of history (or folklore) onto the screen, but to infuse the characters of the past with a new life that matches this great era through the accurate perspective of the playwright. In other words, as long as it does not greatly violate the principles of historical records, the meaningful parts should be emphasized, and the meaningless parts should be reduced as much as possible, or even abandoned altogether.</p>
<p>(II) "Mulan Joins the Army" on the Screen</p>
<p>"Mulan Joins the Army" is a folk story. "Weaving shuttle goes 'Ji Ji,' Mulan weaves by the door" has been selected as a textbook reading in elementary schools. This can be regarded as a household folk tale. But the reason why this story has been passed down to this day is nothing more than that the "filial piety" of Hua Mulan, who could "departed to the battlefield for her father" because "her father has no grown-up son, Mulan has no elder brother," has moved future generations. Of course, the Hua Mulan on the screen today is still a "filial daughter," but her "filial piety" is determined by its new value under the major premise of "serving the country with utmost loyalty," "I vow to repay my country with this life, and cut off the love of parting with the ancient sword"! What powerful proof this is!</p>
<p>Moreover, in the middle of "generals die in a hundred battles, warriors return after ten years," the playwright ruthlessly exposed the masks of several characters at that time—characters that still seem very familiar to us now. For example, the old Han and old Liu, who serve as clowns, were taught by Hua Mulan in this way: "Now that the border is in urgent need, everyone is going to join the army, nothing more than to serve the country, and there is absolutely no reason for our own people to bully our own people!" The old Zhao, who boasted that "the people of the Li family village are both civil and military," was only twisting Mulan playfully, but when Mulan returned victoriously, he was "self-intoxicated" by saying "he is my old friend." The most accurate description falls on the military advisor, who said, "good things are about to be ruined by the hands of spies." Through him, we seemed to see the shadow of opening the "door of peace."</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian and Chen Yunshang</p>
<p>Here, I must express my highest respect to Mr. Ouyang and Chen Yunshang.</p>
<p>Regarding the script compilation, due to space constraints, I will write a little bit as follows. Mulan's character: Mr. Ouyang has grasped the soul of this modern Mulan from beginning to end. At the beginning, he wrote about her going to Li's village to hunt, because she accidentally shot old Wang from Li's village, and when they surrounded her, Mulan was so calm and dealt with this group of disorganized people and used tricks to escape. This shows that Mulan is a woman hero who is both civil and military, and is wise and resourceful. Later, she and Yuan Du went to scout out military intelligence, saw through the traitorous conspiracy, and commanded the killing of the enemy. This was not seen before. Pingju Flavor: "Mulan Joins the Army" cannot be denied that it contains the flavor of Pingju. Perhaps the impression given to me by "The Peach Blossom Fan" is too deep, and I feel the loveliness of this Pingju flavor. For example, when the people of Li's village surrounded Mulan, those teasing "Little Mulan, get off your horse and let's talk." "Little Mulan, don't be shy, you can only steal if you can't hunt." "Little Mulan, little darling, if you want to find a man, come here." "Little Mulan, don't be long-winded, I haven't married a wife yet." These all have the flavor of Pingju "words." There are other examples, such as "I vow to repay my country with this life, and cut off the love of parting with the ancient sword!" It's also like the "introduction" in Pingju. Private Affairs of Children: Mr. Ouyang has a unique way of describing the private affairs of children. The most wonderful part of "Mulan Joins the Army" is the section where Mulan and Yuan Du sing "Where is the moon" in the camp tent. It is truly delicate, warm, witty and vivid. Three Interludes: "Where is the moon" as mentioned above; Although "When the sun comes out, it fills the world" was sung when Mulan and her little companions were playing, the second song, "When the sun comes out, it fills the world, quickly practice your skills, don't be afraid of robbers and thieves, send them all back home!" also shows the author's intention; "Three people walk the same road" This song has a very exotic flavor and is very suitable for the plot.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang, this movie star who came to the "isolated island" from the south, the success of this work seems to be enough to compensate for the discomfort she has suffered from coming to the temperate zone. Her Mulan, at the beginning, has the state of a little daughter, lively and lovely, the justice when she joined the army for her father, and the handsome, demeanor, and conversation after changing into military uniform have reached the state of perfection. Especially in the camp tent, the scene of singing "Where is the moon" with Mei Xi vividly shows the psychology of a daughter's family. The voice change is also very natural.</p>
<p>Her next work is really worth our attention. (It is said that she once refused to play "Fairy Yunshang", I don't know if it's true?)</p>
<p>Director and Others</p>
<p>Bu Wancang is the director of "Diao Chan", and now he is here to direct this "Mulan Joins the Army". It can be said that he is an expert in directing costume films. "Diao Chan" and "Mulan Joins the Army" have a clear characteristic, that is, the former's tone is very heavy, and the latter is fluent and brisk. The handling of large scenes is still the same as "Diao Chan", and there are inevitable places of chaos. Mei Xi's Liu Yuan Du played very well in the second half of the play, but he lacked the spirit of a hero in the front, and compared with Mulan, he seemed too weak. The photography of several scenes such as the desert and the camp tent are very good. The sound is also clear.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, although there are many omissions, I have to leave it at that.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely recommend this rare movie to all audiences in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e104">A Tour of the City God Temple Market <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>"Shanghai is a land of every inch of gold," this sentence is indeed expressed even more profoundly now. Any corner of empty land, even wasteland, is now being used to build tall houses and spacious markets, taking advantage of this densely populated and abnormally prosperous market to engage in business and obtain profits.</p>
<p>In the middle section of Luzon Road, on a short, narrow, and secluded road, a "City God Temple Market" (opened on the 14th) has been built on an open and barren field. From a distance, a row of such low houses supports a towering gatehouse, like a city head, like an ancient temple, and like a wind and rain pavilion. In terms of external outline, colorful tones, and window patterns, it fully expresses the posture of Eastern artistic architectural beauty and maintains the character of classical meaning. At the same time, it will also make people think of the unfortunate encounter of the City God Temple, the source of Chinese Buddhism in Shanghai. The power of God has already shown its weakness, and now it is time to pay attention to the power of oneself!</p>
<p>Stepping into the gate, the air is tense, the dynamics are busy, and the eyes are full of brilliant and dazzling tones, new houses, new products, new arrangements, and the crowds working here also show a different kind of joy, a different kind of pride, and a different kind of excitement because they have a new source of life!</p>
<p>Two winding paths separate to the left and right, sandwiching an octagonal pavilion-style house; although the area is small, you can't see the other side when standing on this side. The space is full of paper flowers, advertisements, slogans, and crowds of people moving like ants, back and forth, and each path is crowded to the extreme, making it difficult to move quickly.</p>
<p>The low houses inside are divided into such small rooms (the rent for each room is 35 yuan or 60 yuan, plus a small rent of 200 yuan), filled with goods for sale, including: cloth, food, stationery, glass, clothing, hats, shoes, socks, medicines, paper, toys, rouge? Fragrant powder, etc., daily necessities, as well as incense candles used for superstitious idols, and mahjong tiles and poker cards used for gambling, etc.; various shops and factories are gathered into such a department store market, becoming a collection of daily necessities, just like each department is gathered together to form a society and generate a powerful driving force. If you don't use the strength of every cell to gather together, then I don't know how many tens of thousands of dollars it will take to build a market. Although it is not as great as the four companies, and the goods are not as extensive and numerous, it has the prototype of a market, like a village or town in the interior, with a simple flavor.</p>
<p>Strolling around, wandering around, observing, slowly walking from the east to the west, and then slowly walking from the west to the east; carefully looking at the origin of various goods and their manufacturing factories in front of those merchants, browsing the layout of each department, paying attention to their internal organization, and at the same time, paying attention to the demeanor of those consumers and the leisurely state of the noisy crowd.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps because it is the end of the lunar year, there are particularly many consumers. In every part of this market, every kind of goods has a large number of buyers, and they are taken out in bags and bundles; the rich are all indifferent, as long as they enjoy themselves comfortably, using banknotes like waste paper. Therefore, we feel that Shanghai now needs more buildings, more production, and consumer organizations to provide the general public with enjoyment and accommodate the general unemployed people. At the same time, we also hope to open up outlets for domestic goods in the market and become a pure domestic goods market, so as to directly and indirectly increase the economic strength of the war of resistance and give play to the national duty.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Tracing Back the Past, Zhao Letian Shares Wonderful Words, Forging New Friendships, and Making a Leisurely Trip in a Scenic Place</p>
<p>He Shuangyu asked again: "I suppose you were also wounded on the battlefield and had it amputated in the hospital?" Zhao Letian said: "There's no need to mention the war now. Two countries fought each other. What deep hatred do the people of the two countries have? You want to kill me, and I kill you. But the aggressors want to reduce people and seize people's land. Anyone with a heart will come out to resist. My leg was sacrificed to defend the country, and it was also sacrificed to defend myself. Speaking of which, I'm worth it. Although I lost this leg, I don't know how many lives I took in my hands. I was a machine gunner. I aimed very accurately. With just a slight movement, many enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. So even though my body is disabled, I only have to repent and have no resentment. When I was carried to the hospital, I thought I couldn't survive. The years after that were all leftover days, so I'm quite optimistic and resigned to my fate. My name is Letian (Optimistic)." The three young ladies listened with great interest, and Wu Junsu asked again: "Mr. Zhao! When your leg was amputated, what did you feel?" Zhao Letian said: "At that time, I was already muddled. What feelings could I have? Fortunately, both my parents were dead at that time, and I hadn't married a wife, so I was just a bachelor. I really had no worries. They put medicine on me when they amputated my leg, so I was in a daze and didn't know. What I'm most grateful for are those nurses who treated me so well. Even my own sisters wouldn't have done that. The funniest thing is that my foot had already been amputated, but I still thought it hadn't been amputated. I said to a nurse, Miss Wang, 'My foot is itchy.' But the foot was already gone, so what foot was there? What itchiness was there? But Miss Wang didn't say I didn't have a foot, but comforted me and said, 'Is your foot itchy? I'll rub it for you and it'll be fine.' Later, I thought to myself that I didn't have a foot, but I wanted someone to scratch it, and I laughed at myself. They didn't laugh. They even shed tears behind my back. Alas! I'm really grateful for their kindness, and I still can't forget it." Zhao Letian looked at the three young ladies, who were all moved and seemed to show sadness. He said, "Let's not talk about these things. My name is Letian, and I'm an optimist. I'll tell you something: because I have one leg, I've taken advantage of it." Wu Junsu was the most impatient and asked, "What's the matter? Zhao Guangsheng took advantage of it?" Zhao Letian said, "When I go to the shoe store to buy shoes, people want to buy a pair, but I only need to buy one. But they won't sell just one.

<p>Chen Yunshang Kills Six People in Shanghai</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang, who starred in "Mulan Joins the Army", is heroic and skilled in martial arts. She brandishes her spear to kill the enemy in the film. Those who were visibly killed totaled more than six people. One day, the director sighed to Miss Chen and said, "You've been in Shanghai for over a month and have already killed six people. How is that okay?" Miss Chen, upon hearing this, put on a smug smile.</p>
<p>Camels Shed Tears in the Desert</p>
<p>The desert set in the film "Mulan Joins the Army", with its boundless and vast sandy expanses, is truly magnificent. One day, a camel was hired to perform in the play. The camel had been in Shanghai for sixteen years. Upon seeing the desert set, it almost thought it had returned to its hometown. Tears welled up in its eyes, and it let out a painful cry. Chen Yunshang, dressed as a Mongolian woman, led it across the desert. It (referring to the camel) became even more saddened. It leaned on Miss Chen with a reluctance to part, and those who saw it said it was homesick and a sentimental camel.</p>
<p>Costume Dramas Aim to Earn Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>It is said that the domestic costume dramas released during the Lunar New Year are all grand and magnificent. Film companies are probably not self-deprecating, so films like Yihua's "Xiang Yu the Conqueror" and Huacheng's "Mulan Joins the Army" have made exceptions by placing large advertisements in local Western newspapers, presumably wanting to attract foreign audiences in order to sell foreign copies! If it can become a reality, it can earn some foreign wealth and increase China's foreign exchange funds, which can be said to be a good way to promote domestic goods. But Guohua Company's "Meng Jiang Nu" doesn't want foreign exchange and closes itself off, why is it so polite?</p>
<p>"Wu Zetian" Enters Great Shanghai</p>
<p>Fang Peilin, the king of set design, joined Xinhua and his first costume epic "Wu Zetian" has achieved excellent results, especially the magnificent sets, not inferior to foreign films. The Great Shanghai Theater has always been known for specializing in American films, but upon seeing the film's very satisfactory results, it has obtained the exclusive premiere rights in Shanghai. The film is scheduled to be officially released on the Lantern Festival. This shot will definitely be a hit. It can also be regarded as the glory of domestic films.</p>

<p>The News of Yingxiang Island's Plum Blossom. Dr. Mei Hua of Xiang Island recently suffered from rhinitis, because when Dr. Mei blew his nose, he covered his nostrils with a handkerchief, causing his eardrums to be injured. (According to the doctor, this method of sneezing is not suitable.) He initially felt severe pain, but was cured after surgery. Recently, his close friends in Shanghai have received his telegram saying that he is well.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Grand Opening of the Golden Gate Theater <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Golden Gate Theater at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Ya'erbei Road held its opening ceremony at 8:30 last night. The situation was very enthusiastic and grand at the time. On Fuxu Road, there was a constant flow of traffic, and there were ants of viewers in front of the theater. At 8 o'clock, the music team of the post office played music first. At 8:30, the party song was played, and Mrs. Ma Xiangsheng was invited to cut the ribbon. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a famous figure in the business community, opened the ceremony. Then, Mr. Ma Xiangsheng, the chairman of the theater, gave an opening speech, followed by guest speeches and a thank-you speech by President Wu Maobao. The opening ceremony was successfully completed. Immediately, the movie was shown, with clear light and accurate sound. The entire building has soundproofing equipment, so the sound can be gathered and not scattered, and every word can be heard. The equipment inside the theater is exquisite and unparalleled, making it the only film palace in the West Shanghai District. It is heard that the opening date of the theater has been set for 9:00 p.m. on February 18th, with the premiere of Sonia Henie's skating epic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (i.e., "Thin Ice"). The seat prices are 30 cents, 50 cents, and 80 cents. Tickets for 80-cent seats can be reserved by phone. The reservation phone number is 74456.</p>

<p>Opening Method 14th Game</p>
<p>Black First</p>
<p>(Explanation)</p>
<p>Reverse Cannon against Central Cannon (Straight Chariot Method)</p>
<p>The move continues from game thirteen</p>
<p>Pawn 5 advances 1, changes to Cannon 8 moves to 9 Horse 8 advances 7 Chariot 2 advances 6</p>
<p>Reverse Horse advances 2 to 3. The reverse cannon against the central cannon takes the method of concealing skill in clumsiness to wait for the opportunity to work. Cannon 8 moves to 6 is the official move. The reason for first advancing the Elephant 4 to 5 without moving the Horse 8 to 7 is the method of waiting for the opportunity to work. If the Chariot is used to press the Horse, the Cannon 2 can retreat 1 to attack the Chariot. The Elephant 3 advances 5 to facilitate the advancement of the Chariot. Pawn 5 advances 1 is the next move. Cannon 6 advances 5 to gain a piece. At this time, the black side must lose a piece. It can be seen that Cannon 8 moving to 6 is definitely not a casual move. Its function is to prevent the opponent's Commander Horse from advancing urgently, which is one method that those who hold the central cannon should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Pawn 5 advances 1 and changes to Cannon 8 moving to 9 to avoid attacking the Horse and also to open up the Chariot path. Horse 8 advances 7 to guard against the opponent using the Chariot to press the Horse. After starting the Horse, if Pawn 7 advances 1 again, the Horse can advance to the river mouth, creating a powerful momentum. Chariot 2 advances 6, already seeing the intention of advancing the Horse, so advance the Chariot to control the Horse path. At this time, the situation is very stable. The above are all official moves, so there is no loss of the advantage.</p>

<p>The actors' habits of eating, drinking, gambling, and playing with birds, beasts, insects, and fish</p>
<p>In Beiping, some children from poor families also catch them day and night, selling them in large quantities to wealthy families who buy them. Therefore, people like Shuyan raise them in several tables. Generally, dozens of sand jars can be placed on an eight-immortal table. Each jar contains one or two crickets. Some jars are stacked three, four, five, or six layers high, so each table has hundreds of crickets. Some wealthy young masters from large mansions ask their like-minded friends, "How many tables are you raising this year?" In fact, the price of one table is considerable; how much more for raising three or five tables? One year, in Rong Zhifeng's mansion's West Flower Hall, I saw Shuyan in a great battle with a Mr. Yang from Wuxi. This Mr. Yang was the "King of Cricket Farming" in Pingjin. His family was already wealthy, and he could still earn ten or twenty thousand on this every year. Therefore, he raised more and better crickets than anyone else, and he hired several people to manage this matter. Whenever it was time to compete with others, he would first have people carry them in baskets, selecting the best thirty or so jars in the box. When they arrived at the designated location, the jars were taken out and placed on tables in the courtyard. After the jar lids were removed, they were covered with extremely delicate bamboo curtains to let the little insects bask in the sun. Before the fight, each one was weighed, noting one "qian" (a traditional unit of weight), or eight or nine "fen," or even more than one "qian," or even two "qian." However, the larger ones were not as fierce and durable as the short and sturdy ones. Therefore, during the fight, most of the crickets were around one "qian." One "qian" fought one "qian," and nine "fen" fought nine "fen." The weight difference between the two sides could not be too great. Therefore, the person holding the scales had to be impartial. Shuyan fought several rounds with Mr. Yang, and often lost to him. Later, he spent ten yuan to buy a cricket, and also defeated many powerful opponents. He was very proud of it. A few days later, there was another decisive battle at Rong's residence. The stakes of this decisive gamble were greater than ever. At first, they could still fight to a tie, but in the end, he still lost to the other person. Losing money was one thing, but it was too embarrassing. So, from then on, he was so angry that he stopped playing.</p>

<h3 id="e111">New Lineup of Shanghai Theaters <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Changes in the roles of actors in Shanghai theaters. Except for the Golden Grand Theater's business policy, which usually uses average actors for short periods and changes them from time to time. Every time the Lunar New Year comes, the theater is wholeheartedly focused on the selection and abandonment of roles. People who love drama in society also pay attention to the changes in the lineup of each theater. Now, based on the names of the artists in the table above (this table is not very detailed), it can be seen that the Grand Theater, the Carlton, and the Gong Stage have basically no changes. And can slightly distinguish their nature as left.</p>
<p>The Golden Grand Theater is all about the Peking actors, and the performances are limited to the old Beijing-style dramas.</p>
<p>The Grand Theater and the Gong Stage are engaged in the continuous performance of stage machinery, elaborate sets, dancing, and grand fight scenes, which is their usual style. There is no sign of changing their style at present.</p>
<p>The Carlton is a theater that emphasizes both old plays and newly compiled plays. Since the theater uses Kylin Tong as its cornerstone, it emphasizes acting and recitation, regardless of old or new plays, and is relatively weak in large singing passages.</p>
<p>Tianchan has hired a group of northern actors, including Huang Guiqiu, Guan Shaohua, Du Fulong, Zhang Haichen, Zheng Yuhua, San Jixian, and Wu Jinkui, on top of its original basic artists, which has a general outline to rival Golden.</p>
<p>The Carde Grand Theater only has one Xin Yanqiu, who is said to have been invited from Tianjin. The other roles, such as Zhang Erpeng, Xiao Sanmazi, and Gao Jingmin, have all lived in Shanghai for a long time. During the Lunar New Year, they will probably be calling on old plays.</p>
<p>The Queen's Theater uses Gai Jiaotian as its main pillar, and supplements it with Little Gai Jiaotian. Those who like to watch Gai-style martial arts dramas can go to this theater to enjoy them.</p>
<p>Overall, considering the roles of each theater, the Golden Grand Theater is the most complete for listening to old plays. The Huang Guiqiu and Guan Shaohua of Tianchan can also be a refreshing change. To watch the Kylin style, of course, it belongs to the Carlton. To watch stage machinery, sets, dancing, and grand fight scenes, you can go to the Grand Theater and the Gong Stage. As for the Queen and the Carde, the Gai-style martial arts dramas each stand on their own. Since Zhang Yunxi of the Golden Grand Theater has not come to Shanghai, looking around the martial arts actors of the various theaters in Shanghai, almost all of them are dominated by the Gai-style martial arts actors. This situation is indeed unique in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Shortcut to Fame for Hollywood Movie Stars (Part Two) <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhenxiong</p>
<p>A reference for men and women who aspire to be on the screen</p>
<p>(16) Fall in love with a Hollywood publicist. He can admire you and introduce you in many ways, and promote you extensively. Janet Gaynor became famous!</p>
<h3 id="e113">Ya Ling Hui Lan <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>(17) Be a manicurist in a large Hollywood barbershop, waiting for an honest studio mogul, because he says he can give you a screen test. After waiting two weeks, Ya Ling Hui Lan stepped onto the screen.</p>
<p>(18) Originally an elementary role in a choir, she later worked hard and stood in the front row, attracting the attention of people in the film industry, allowing Joan Crawford to step onto the film stage.</p>
<p>(19) A handsome player on a football team, he jumped from the West Coast team to Hollywood's Rose Bowl team. Like John Mack Brown of Alabama, he stepped into the film city because of this.</p>
<p>(20) Those who became famous in nightclubs and then transitioned to the screen include the Ritz Brothers, Martha Raye, Margo, Ann Miller, and Doris Weston.</p>
<p>(21) Study singing for several years, then perform in Los Angeles. After a year, people from the film industry will come to invite you. This is like Elson Eddie.</p>
<p>(22) Looking like a character in an illustration in a magazine, Maurice was hired by the film company.</p>
<p>(23) It is best to perform in a theater, but it should be very close to Hollywood. Like Florence Eldridge, Robert Young, and Jane Bryan, they all came from here.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Jane Bryan <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>(24) If you are only twelve years old and have eight years of stage experience, then you should boldly enter the film industry. For example, the child star Judy Garland.</p>
<p>(25) Those who have a good reputation in foreign countries include Annabella, Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, Louise Rainer, Francesca Gaal, Madeleine Carroll, and Danielle Darrieux.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Danielle Darrieux <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>(26) Learn the basic knowledge of acting, then perform in small theaters, and then make a living on the New York stage. Although this is not necessarily a shortcut to the screen, it is an accurate path. Like Claudette Colbert, Paul Muni, Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy, James Stewart, and Basil Rathbone, they all followed this path to the Hollywood studio.</p>
<p>(27) If you have a beautiful singing voice on the radio, and your face is as beloved as your singing voice, then you are destined to be on the screen. For example, Bing Crosby, Joe Penner, and Don Ameche.</p>
<p>(28) Coming to Hollywood with her mother for a visit, she visited a few old friends, one of whom took her to the screen. Nancy Carroll was also fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Nancy Carroll <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(29) If your voice and appearance are like a certain movie star, then you can run to his studio and tell them that you are his protector, and you can get a screen test. This is how Frank Coghlan Jr. got to play James Cagney's childhood role in "The Public Enemy."</p>
<p>(30) Studying at a Hollywood high school, snatching other people's breakfasts and eating them as your own food, and constantly eating things on the street, attracting people's attention, and then Lana Turner was also led into the Hollywood studio.</p>
