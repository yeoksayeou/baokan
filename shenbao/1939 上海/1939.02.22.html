<h3>此三日間</h3>
<p>此三日間，國內外無甚意外之大變化。</p>
<p>本報以寒假休刊三日，今日始復與讀者諸君相見。以報紙之為社會耳目喉舌，所由司視聽，達意念，是應如何晝夜宏張，終年母使或間；况值世局艱危，瞬息萬變之秋，茲乃間以三日，雖曰事屬萬不得已，顧亦我報人所不安，抑且深愧。所幸者，此三日間，國內外無甚意外之大變化，此則小別之後、應首先告慰讀者。至於一般動態，諸多可紀，追紀之於新聞欄。其間有尤足述者焉。</p>
<p>行遠自邇，請先言上海：此三日內，包括上海百業總結束期；回溯全年，戰局推移，上海一隅，雖以交通之阻梗而類孤島，却以人事之趨避而居民激增，又以供需之失常而物價步漲；於是本屆之總結束，工商界非但不聞倒閉，且有家家盈餘之觀；故在整個上海為畸形榮枯之甚，在工商界則可謂空前豐年，是可大書特書者也。同時在此三日之內，上海暗殺案特多，半在租界之內，半在租界警權所不及之區，俱未破案。</p>
<p>在中國：政治方面最可注意者，厥為國民參政會集會重慶，蔣委員長以兼議長致辭；對於抗議建國之過去未來，有剴切詳明之指示；其演辭詳刋報端，精博宏大，非數言所得舉其要旨；而最為我人感不絕於心者，厥為勗國人務以言論與行動，自精神方面作全國族總動員。自抗戰以來任何方面之總動員說，俱成老生常談：而實際事功，頗可懷疑；其間病態，原不祗一端，然從細微處加以分析，則到處可以發現二重人格實為病源。云何二重人格？聞其言係一人，察其行係又一人：在大庭廣衆間係一人，在私室係又一人；責人者係一人，律己者係又一人。國人原有不以人廢言之誡，彼侃侃而談者，但聞其所談之切合真理與吾，而不必問其為何如人，此誠為勤求眞理之絕好態度；然其流弊所至，問彼侃侃，揆彼營營，不但見其言論之不由眞誠而不予人以絲毫感動，且以其行動而根本致疑於所侃侃者之初非眞理。抗戰以來。精神總動員之浮而不實，非以此歟？蔣委員長以克己克苦，身體力行，成其偉大；茲復將言論與行動並舉以相勗者。針對時弊而發者也。國民參政會决議要案甚多，內容有待公布；其間有組織特種委員會之决議，專事檢討歷屆决議案之實際成效，此則議政之機樞也。至於軍事方面。三日來，各戰塲雖交綏無虛日，但無大規模戰爭，最值興奮者，中國空軍屢建功勛，在蘭州與長沙且以空戰制勝；此則至少可以反證中國重建空軍之已有成就，而近頃所表演者，可見端矣。</p>
<p>在國際：德義二國，於此三日之內，無公然之駭人舉動；西班牙內戰難於調停，但未絕望；英國對國際之態度，於其和平的作為之中，頗能表示强勁；法國在越南與東菲洲，俱事充實防務；美國輿情漸見其明期而硬化；蘇俄沉默，然與世局之大漩渦，漸見其疏遠而灑脫。此外，如荷蘭整軍經武，北愛爾蘭表示在英國對外作戰時無可中立，英法兩國相繼向國際聯盟會秘書處，正式表示對於國際糾紛之仲裁議定書，平時雖信守不渝，但至大局劇變，發生戰事時則不再受議定書之拘束；此數事者，雖未可視為極重要之形態，然對於目前之國際現象，或自正面，或自側面，亦既表示其一部份之態度，而間接亦頗成為安定國際現象之因素者也。國際反侵略大會方在倫敦開會，决議制日援華，此與各國政府之行動無直接關係，然中國在國際之趨向有利，有如銳角猛進；而日本在國際之孤立，則愈演愈深刻；是可於反侵略大會見之矣。</p>
<p>此三日間，內外動態之輪廓，大致如此。總之，一切演變，皆向是非黑白利害禍福之分水嶺而進行、蓋與最後决定之距離愈接近矣。利用有組織的物質、然後可以掃蕩侵略的暴敵、樹立戰後建國的永久基礎、這種任務、這種使命、無疑的皆是中國有史以來最艱巨最偉大的、去年臨時全國代表大會决定召集國民參政會、目的是在集中全國的力量、以排除空前的國難、集合全國的意志、以樹立建國的基礎、我們可以說國民參政會對國家最大的貢獻、就在於發揮我們全國一致的民族精神、提高我們固有民埃道德、這種精神和道德的感應力、直達到各省各縣直達到文化經濟每一職業每一部門的國民、就可以鼓舞起同仇敵愾不屈不撓的精神、啟示全國國民對於國家民族光明前途的自信、臨此這個抗戰進入第二期的時候、我以為强化的精神、集中精神、以我們的霄論行動、領導全國精神總動員、應該是本屆大會的工作中心所在、我們要集中國民的精神、就必須使全國國民對於自身、都確立共同的道德、對於國家民族、堅定共同的信仰、而每一份子、能够根據這個共同道德觀念、共同的建國信仰、而努力而奮鬥而犧牲、這個共同的道德是什麽、就是捨小我為大我、我們的共同信仰是什麽、就是三民主義、根據這個信仰去實現的目的是什麼、就是我們中國政治最高理想、大同世界、禮運說、「大道之行也、天下為公、選賢與能、講信修睦故人不獨親其親、不獨子其子、使老有所終、壯有所用、幼有所長、鰥寡孤獨廢疾者、皆有所養、男有分、女有歸、貨惡其棄於地也、不必藏於己、力務其出於身也、不必為已、是故謀閉而不與、盜竊亂賊而不作」這眞是我們建國的目的、達到了這個目的、纔是全國人民共同享划了幸福、纔是三民主義眞正的實現、諸位先生、我們今天一方面是流血流汗在抗戰、一方面是琿精竭智在建國、我們總理孫先生所欲建立的新國家、就是要做到禮運所說的大同之治、這一次五中全會宣言中所說的三點、　眞誠純一加强團結、　貢獻能力自由生命於國家、積極奮鬥、　集中一切時間精力、以實行辦理建設、政治建設與經濟建設、這固然為抗戰、同時也為建國、我門所着眼的、不僅在目前、更在久遠的將來、我們中國建國的理想旣然是人人不私其力、不私其身、勤勞互助、和平康樂的境界、因此我們的出發點、必然要眞誠純一、利害相共、眞正做到天下為公、我們的努力、必須是積極的、而不是消極的、同時我們的增强力量、更必須加緊實施一切有關建國的建設、五中全會的宣言、不僅希望全黨員如此做、尤其希望全國同胞、特別是全國社會領袖、一致接受來實行、我們參政員各位先生、都是富有學問經騐的社會領袖、政府一方面以「選賢與能」的誠意、集中全國才智來共負國家的責任、同時更希望以「講信修睦」四個字、作為團結全國力量的基礎、因此我所誠懇希望各位參政昌同人的、就是大家首先確立互信與共信、一切都開誠相與、肝胆相見、造成了和諧親睦、有如一家兄弟手足的態度、無事不可直言，無事不可共諒、一方面要各位儘量的徵取民意、切實的代表民意、來分別發揚民愛、知無不言、言無不盡、使政府社會之間、完全相互了解融治貫通、沒有一絲一毫的阻滯、一方面更希望各位以宏博悲憫之胸懷、實行我們先哲所謂「不獨親其親、不獨子其子」的敎條、將一人一家一鄉一地方的利益、融匯到全國與整個民族的利益、我們要推親親之心、以及於敬老恤貧、扶助痛苦的同胞、解救國家的危難、我們耍推慈愛自家子弟之心、來愛護全國靑年、保育全國靑年、給他們以良好的模範、導引他們到眞誠純一共同為國奮鬥的途徑、以鞏固我民族久遠的生命、我們參政員同人能以此精神、領導全國、我敢說「抗戰必勝、建國必成」、三民主義最終目的、大同世界、也必能實現、為要具體說明我個人的希望、我不憚反覆的再要提出兩點的意見、我以為這兩點完全做到了以後、我們參政會對於目前抗戰建國的貢獻、將更偉大、我們共赴國難的精神、將更顯著而光明、我們全國賢者能者領袖人士的精神、能提振起來、打通政府和人民的意志、集中政府和人民的力量、這一種效力、較之提高前錢上官兵勇敢犧牲的精神、還要大過十倍、我所說的兩點希望是什麼呢、第一、本屆大會、要充分表現積極的精神、我們參政會的產生、不同於通常國家的議會、我們的組織、精神、我們成立　環境和經過、都是在世界政治史上沒有先例的、而我們過去兩屆大會中的成績、盡量避免了普通議會的積習、更是我們足以自豪於世界的、現在抗戰建國的工作更是迫切、為節省時間增進效能起見、我以為我們要更進一步、盡量减少不重要的提案、而多多致力於積極的富有建設性的實際的建議與討論、記得上屆大會為了原稿審查辦法一案、討論許久、消耗了抗戰時期的寶貴光陰、到今天諸位一定很明白、我們政府是革命的政府、是具有責任心的政府、而且完全是以民意與公理為依歸的政府、祇要不違反抗戰建國的利益、政府决沒有理由限制人民的權利、因之我們參政員人人也不必過分為個人的利與自由着想、反致忽略了國家整個的利害、我們到了今天、必須盡量發揚我們的積極性、而避免我們過去千年來習染很深的消極性、我們過去的國民性、例如懷疑·磨擦·防止對抗·都是偏於消極方面的、不但不能促進一切的事業、反而消耗了許多有用的精力阻礙不少的進步、甚至躭誤了國家的大事、我們祇看宋明兩代的滅亡、並不是由於軍事的無辦法、也不是絕對沒有愛國愛民的賢者、只是大家互矜意氣、各立門戶、私心自用，主張紛歧、遂使精神不能統一、意志力量因此分散、看局部的利益、高於國們今日要為全國國民與千秋後世立一個好榜樣、就必須以積極性來代替消極性、以建設性來代替破壞性、以互助團結來代替懷疑和排拒、所以我們這一屆工作、要多多集中了抗戰後期一切實際方案辦法的建議、要特別提高公忠體國共禦外侮的精神、一切討論和建議都要貫注以積極性、第二、本屆大會要充分發揚眞誠純一互信共信的精神、國家到今天這樣地步、我們坐視不救、將待誰來救、國家民族的利益、我們不慎重愛護、將待誰來愛護、我們必須使個人和國家融合為一個人的力量、要使成為國家的力量、個人的意志、要服從國家的意志、必先國家獲得自由、而後個人纔眞能享有自由、我們每個人都以國家民挨的利益、放在第一位、更要推己及人、相信中華民國的國民、都有愛國的良知、有了共信、就必有互信、我們要怎樣做到眞誠純一呢、能為國家民族利益而犧牲、　是真誠、國家民族以外、無其他雜念、　是純一、我們為了國家、死且不惜、　論其他、我們全體一致站在國家民族的利益上、宣傳要為國家民族而宣傳、行動要為國家民族而行動乃至思想、也要為國家民族而思想、我們在己、固要竭誠努力、然是要純粹的為國努力、對人對事、耍絕對的彼此相信、然後纔能發生共同的力量、來對付共同的敵人、完成我們共同的志願、現在政府中負責的人員、如果不是為了國家民族的前途、决不會道樣任勞任怨的負責下去、諸位如果不為了國家民族的前途、也不會這樣辛辛苦苦來共赴國難、所以政府和我們參政員的認識是一致的、目標也是一致的、彼此對國家民族的前途、抱有共信、彼此之間、抱有互信、這就可以打破一切的隔閡、屛絕一切成見、親愛精誠、實事求是、做到和衷共濟、顚危相扶的程度、只要憑這一段精誠、任何困難都可克服、任何事業必能成功、以上所貢獻的兩點、思想很平凡、但希望皆甚眞擎、中正自抗戰以來、身負重託、精神意志、無時無刻不與我全體同人相感通、現在擔任了本會議長、和諸位接觸的機會更多、彼此之間、更可以進一步的同心戮力、互相切磋、在這個抗戰建國的重大使命中、得與諸位共同負責、實在覺得感奮而欣幸、祇是自問愚拙、恐不足以副同人之望、以後中正個人如有見不到的地方、或有什麽差誤過失、或言行不一、或有不誠不實、不能盡忠職守之時、務望諸位不吝敎益、隨時糾正、以期毌負斯職、中正只憑着這一片為國為民之愚忠與赤忱、願與各位患難與同、榮辱與共、一心一德、貫澈始終、以盡到我們對抗戰建國所負的使命、以答政府和全國同胞的期望、」（十九日電）</p>

<h3>新運五週紀念　蔣委員長廣播演講　過去工作適合抗戰需要　應更努力重建立國精神</h3>
<p>（重慶）在重慶居民慶祝陰曆新年聲中、政府各機關因國難關係、雖遇例假、仍照常辦公、本年陰曆元旦、適為新生活運動之五週紀念日、蔣委員長曾於昨晚在無綫電中演說此項運動之重大意義、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）蔣委員長於十八日廣播新生活運動五週年紀念講詞、茲錄全文於次、</p>
<p>全國同胞、今天是新生活運動五週年的紀念日、我們將這五年來新運進程中所得的成績、和五年來國家民族前後遭遇的情形兩相比較、澈底檢討一番、第一、我們覺得五年光陰很快的過了、而我們對於復興事業的努力、實在沒有達到我們所預期的地步、我們同胞的精神、還不能十分振作、沒有做到各竭其能、各盡其職的地步、但同時我們又覺得五年以前所播下的種子、畢竟發生了相當的功效、我們民族固有的道德精神、由於新生活運動的喚起、在一年有半的抗戰中間、隨時隨地、都有熱烈堅强的表現、我們全國上下、得到種種事實的鼓勵、秉持了民族自信心、已經踏上了建國復興的大道、無論精神和事業都巳顯示着在逐步前進之中、尤其我們感覺到在抗戰中間、由於國民生活的變遷和戰時環境的接觸、凡是新生活運動所要做到的各種生活習慣的改造、例如迅速·確實·簡樸·整齊、多半不待督促、而皆能順利地實現、</p>
<p>一般國民從現實中去鍜鍊、從行動中去學習、都已領悟着新生活運動的眞正意義和價值、因之我們今後推行新運、就可以事半功倍、就可以將從前用於口舌文字宣傳的力量、用於推進實際的行動、綜括一句話、我們應該本着已有的成績、推廣努力的範圍、順着國民精神自然演進的趨勢、就在這抗戰建國的非常時期中、奠定我民族光明進步現代生活的基礎、在過去一年之中、新生活運動總會所發動的工作、如組織戰地服務團、慰勞傷兵和前敵將士改善壯丁的生活、提倡節的運動、發動學生暑期晨村服務、都為適合抗戰的需要、也都得到同胞們熱烈的贊助、而婦女同胞在新生活運動的組織下、踴躍參加有關抗戰的工作，更是進一步的做到全民衆動員的徵象、這種種推行的成績、都不是在平時所容易得到的、但加果戰前不植立初步的基礎、也不見得有這樣的收穫、（未完）</p>
<h3>槍傷日人事件　與政治無關　開槍者似確為韓人　其動機殆出於妬念</h3>
<p>（本報今晨特訊）昨日下午、有某西報記者向公共租界警務處某高級人員詢及星期日南京路冠生園前有人向三日人開槍、傷及一日婦、是案具何動機、據該員答稱、是案確無政治性質云、又據他方面消息、開槍者似確為一韓人、甚至當時日人所　汽車之汽車夫對捕房所作之供辭、亦稱渠意開槍者乃一日人、或韓人云、又據甚可靠方面猜測、受傷者乃一舞女、操英語甚流利、就各情觀之，槍擊案必出於前愛該舞女者之妬念、猶億星期一日晚間，本埠日報界開會時、有某訪員提及該女子之職業時、會中主席即曰、「吾人無庸再聽此言、據日憲兵調查所得、是案實有人企圖歪曲事實、故不必完畢是問」、於是該訪員即止發言、由此觀之、是案眞相、亦可明白矣、</p>

<h3>日方又用恫嚇故技　擬對租界施壓力　甚至謂將置條約於不顧　租界當局必謀適當處置</h3>
<p>路透社二十一日東京電、據朝日新聞今日消息、在滬舉行之日軍會議、已决定於必要時施用武力、以期肅淸公共租界內之反日恐怖份子、路透社二十一日東京電、民政黨議員小山、今日在衆院開會時、對於上海之局勢、作緊急之問話、並對於「維新政府」外交部長陳錄於二月十九日晚在日軍佔領區域內被刺身死事、表示哀悼、小山所發問者、有</p>
<p>下列各問題</p>
<p>（一）上海公共租界工部局是吾無維持秩序之能力、或有此項能力而無維持秩序之誠意、（二）中政府之行刺者、有無與工部局當局結合之徵象、（三）如條的及法律有使人猶豫之處、則自衛之權、是否可超越一切條約、日方是吾未有實施此項自衛權之意、（四）日方有無擴張肅淸工作至公共租界與法租界之意、平沼首相於其答詞中略謂、向來一般人所認為安全區域之上海</p>
<p>公共租界內</p>
<p>屢次發生恐怖示威事件、已開始使人發生該租界祇為不法份子恐怖行為根據地之印象、果使如此、則採取手段以保障中國和平與秩序的問題、是必須從根本上重行予以考慮、吾人對於中政府及共產黨在租界中之秘密活動、不能加以忽視、政府方面已訓令該地之當局採取適當之有效辦法矣、綜之、無物可阻止自衛權之實施云、有田外相繼起宣稱、政府對於上海公共租界內</p>
<p>形勢之發展</p>
<p>向以深切之注意監視之、上海日總領事三浦、已於二月十日請求公共及法租界之當局、嚴厲處置非法及激烈份子、如局勢未有進步、則必須採取根本上辦法、以保障法律與秩序云、海相米內發言謂、關於上海公共租界將來和平之維持、實有實行一種澈底改革的必要、渠甚願對於此事、採取</p>
<p>最有效辦法</p>
<p>云、米內表示其個人意見、以為上海公共租界工部局缺乏誠意、如長此不已、渠認為有採取有效的自衛手段之必要、據日方消息、民政及政友兩黨對於上海恐怖事件之層出不窮、均極為關切、聞國會方面贊成使用武力、以彈壓公共租界中之恐怖份子、日本各報則對於上海形勢表示甚大之憤慨、日日新聞力促「維新政府」及日政府</p>
<p>行使自衛權</p>
<p>以取締上海兩租界中之不法份子、並謂此項份子、專向日人及親日華人作恐怖之示威、而不受懲戒、該報又悼惜陳籙之死於其時、並表示日本人民對於公共租界當局無力管束不法份子事之憤慨、又謂兩租界當局於接到日本抗議時、輒作事前準備之答復、但從朱施行取締恐怖行為之有效的方法、兩租界當局雖竭力保護第三方面之人民、然對於中日人</p>
<p>所有之危險</p>
<p>則殆不注意、天津英法兩租界亦有同樣情形之存在、中政府與共產黨之黨羽、現均從事於反對日本及中國新政權之活動、而不受懲戒、彼等之根據地設於上海之公共租界、與法租界、及天津之英法兩租界、中國新政權與日政府、亟宜行使自衛權力、因公共租界與法租界當局、不能保護中日人之生命，已喪失其　衛相力也云、朝日新聞亦</p>
<p>發同樣論調</p>
<p>謂上海兩租界發生恐怖案件二十餘起，而未有一兇犯就遠、此事殊可扼腕、兩租界當局未有約束不法份子或制止其秘密活動之能力、及其與此輩結合而企圖援助中政府之舉動、現已受人指摘、據日方在其致工部局總董樊克林之抗議文、早已料及目前恐怖案件之發生、故上海日當局之决定採取步驟、以應付此種驚人局勢、實不足為奇、日政府宜採取嚴厲手段、以消滅上海兩租界之反日恐怖份子、</p>

<p>滬台綫因台州　有戰事及椒江之封鎖、自二月十八日起、完全斷絕、最後一輪離開海門者、為葡商正德公司之山泰輪、前日英商怡和公司之永陞輪、由海防抵滬、經過台州灣口外洋面時、見有日艦六艘、惟該地天氣、異常惡劣、日軍之企圖登陸、勢必大受影響、又滬溫·滬甬·兩航綫則仍暢通、葡商美利公司之美達輪、已於昨日下午二時由甬駛滬、葡商正德公司之山泰輪、定明日由滬駛甬、意商義華洋行之寳利輪、定後日由滬駛溫、美商華美公司之棠魯輪、定二十六日由滬駛溫、</p>
<p>日艦曾向定海開砲</p>
<p>定海（即舟山）為口之海過去日艦曾經一度登陸、此次海門發生砲戰後、定海形勢、又趨緊張、禁止各輪停靠定海、地方上由民團及警察駐紥、並宜佈戒嚴、二月十八日晨十一時、曾有日艦三艘駛定、在竹山門外向　頭開砲十餘發後即竄去、惟當地警團、未予還擊、該項砲彈均落荒野、故並無損失、現在該島形勢雖緊、但地方安謐如常、</p>

<p>陳　來滬</p>
<p>並未通知警務處、且信陳氏並不知警務處曾作是項請求、昨晚又經警務處某高級人員證實、公共租界當局會請日當局於日方團體欲入蘇州河南岸時、通知警務處、公共租界當局曾向日當局迭作此請、但日方未予答覆、據同盟社消息、昨日日文大陸新報號外載稱、</p>
<p>上海日僑</p>
<p>對日人四名在南京路遭狙擊、與偽南京政權「外交部長」陳籙之被殺、頗為憤懣、刻正要求日軍當局在公共租界內藉武力行事、日僑並擬舉行羣衆大會、促請日當局取激烈行動、以處理恐怖專件、而日僑因「不傷人與無防衛之婦人」即日籍舞女兩人、亦受狙擊之恐怖、故憤懣益甚、</p>

<h3>日又傀儡　鼓吹停戰　設「中國復興社」　並發表荒謬宣言</h3>
<p>日本自侵華軍與以來、其國內財政、已趨　崩潰、人民及軍隊對我之長期抗戰、均恐　異常、厭戰情緒、日形滋長、故日方　急萬狀、曾勾通汪精衛主張議和、　遭國人一致痛斥、計未得售、旋復製造空氣、企望吳佩孚呼籲和平、已遭吳氏堅拒、日方近又嗾使偽「維新政府」各傀儡、組設「中國復興社」、從事鼓吹停戰、並倡言親日防共、於十九日發表宣言、內容荒謬絕倫、見者莫不曲冷、</p>

<h3>日本紙幣發行額激增　通貨準備微少　膨脹危機已在目前　日圓價值勢將慘跌</h3>
<p>大陸報云、據同盟社消息、東京政府决將日本銀行發行紙幣之合法最高限制額、自日金五萬萬元增至二十七萬萬元、同時、日本各殖民地銀行之發行紙幣最高限制額、亦予提高、朝鮮銀行將自六千萬元擴張至一萬萬六千萬元、臺灣銀行自三千萬元提高至八千萬元、自此次</p>
<p>中國戰事</p>
<p>發生以還、日本銀行所發紙幣、業已用各種方法、一再提高、日本本部與其殖民地所流通之紙幣、不斷增加、使東京政府不得不一再更變其管理日本國家銀行紙幣準備金之法律與條例、戰前最後一年、即一九三六年抄、日本銀行之</p>
<p>紙幣流通</p>
<p>額、達一·八六五·七六〇·〇〇〇元、兩年戰爭之後、在一九三八年杪、此紙幣流通額已增至二·八五八·六〇〇·〇〇〇元、所增幾十萬萬元、同期內、朝鮮與臺灣兩銀行所發紙幣亦大增、在日本及其殖民地所發紙幣之總數、於戰爭期間自二·〇五七·二〇〇·〇〇〇元增至三·一一九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、計增百分之五十强、此種</p>
<p>日本紙幣</p>
<p>流通額之擴張、其主因為東京政府在華作戰、消耗過鉅之故、日本國家銀行為抵消其有增無减之國內戰事公債額不得不增加其紙幣之發行、而日本民衆則未能消化此等戰事公債、故仍由日本銀行與上述兩銀行持有之、據日本銀行所刊佈之賬目所載、可見活期</p>
<p>政府存款</p>
<p>銀行存款、貼現證券、與外國滙票墊款、均於一九三七至三八年間减少數額、他方面日本銀行持有之政府公債、則自八二九·〇七三·〇〇〇圓、增至一·八四一·四〇七·〇〇〇圓、計增十萬萬圓有奇、或百分之一百二十五、日本銀行持有公債增加之數、與該銀行所發紙幣增加之數</p>
<p>適相符合</p>
<p>根據以公債形式出之而未經消化的新國債以激增發行紙幣、顯即膨脹之謂、不久前、日本報紙上禁用膨脹字樣、但邇來日本經濟報紙已不復能不承認有膨脹矣、「東方經濟學者」為日本最署名</p>
<p>經濟刊物</p>
<p>其二月號中有言如次、」由此可得結論、日本今方經過比例顯明的膨脹時期、故政府與民衆責當竭力遏制膨脹運動」云云、日本報紙力圖精別金融界之學說、開始論及日方所稱兩種不同的膨脹、即</p>
<p>有害膨脹</p>
<p>與無害之膨脹是、當然、日本報紙稱日本今日所發生者為無害之膨脹、且稱此種膨脹、並無常與有害膨脹有關之不利、當然、此乃純屬胡言、膨脹即是膨脹、與論理學毫無關係、總之、與日本過度之軍費相反者、厥為日本通貨準備金額之極度微少、提高紙幣發行額之</p>
<p>最高限度</p>
<p>易言之、即减低紙幣發行之金準備而已、此次戰爭初起時、日本金準備為百分之四十九、去歲初减至百分之四十、去年杪减至僅百分之二十、旋稍增至百分二十四、此即自軍興起、日本金標準已減低半數之惟、凡此種種、其結果絕無疑義、即日圓之價值將續見大跌是、</p>

<h3>偽組織「外交部長」　陳籙被狙擊斃命　出事地點在西區華界　公共捕房已發現綫索</h3>
<p>路透社二十日重慶電中央日報社評曰、陳籙之被殺、為上海華人贈送前敵戰士之廢曆新年賀禮、在陳籙之前、已有漢奸多人遭同樣之命運、在陳籙之後、吾人其注視之云、</p>
<p>在積習未除之廢曆新年元旦（即十九日）、本埠各業、多數休業、街市景象、另有風光、不圖竟於是日發生極堪驚人之暗殺案、被刺者為甫於上月由南京來滬之偽「維新政府外交部長」陳籙、（字任先）、茲將各情錄下、</p>
<p>來滬度歲</p>
<p>陳籙滬寓地點係在本埠滬西愚園路六六八弄二十五號、亦即越界築路區域、屬於華界鎭寗路轄區、陳於廢曆（十八）日下午六時由南京來滬、當即返其寓所、陳平時出入戒備殊嚴、故除滬寓雇有護衛之保鑣多名外、隨身亦帶有衛士、以防不測、此次陳之來滬、完全係因度歲關係、</p>
<p>開槍狙擊</p>
<p>十九日之晚七時許、突有身　長袍靑年十餘人、均執有手槍盒子砲等武器、自陳寓後門直入、當有二人將陳所雇之保鑣二人、加以監視、若輩見來人旣多、且事出倉卒、被禁後、即無法抗拒、當時靑年中之六七人、即逕入陳寓客堂、時陳方與其友人羅某及家人圍坐客堂中、閒話家常、驟見此不知姓名之多人人內、正在驚奇欲問之際、詎來人已連發二槍、向陳頭部射入、一彈從頸間穿出、一彈射斷喉管、從喉部貫穿、旋復連續發出五六槍、彈貫其右大腿、陳中彈後、當即流血倒地、氣息奄奄、</p>
<p>不罪妻孥</p>
<p>時陳之友人及其妻女、在旁見狀、駕悸欲絕、開槍者見目的已達、當即散發署名「中國靑年鐵血軍」之字單一張、上書「抗戰必勝、建國必成、共滅奸賊、永保華夏」等字樣、幷聲稱我輩為國除害、罪不及妻孥、旋即分途出門而去、據悉此十數人來去陳寓時、因該處係越界築路區域、故足跡均未曾履及公共租界一步、事後各方會竭力設法搜查、卒無所獲、</p>
<p>屍體移殮</p>
<p>陳被狙擊後、當即車送海格路紅十字會醫院求治、惟因彈中要害、在途中已氣息僅屬、比抵該院後、即吿氣絕身死、當於二十日晚五時半由其家屬將陳屍移往台拉斯脫路上海殯儀館殯殮、</p>
<p>陳子戒備</p>
<p>事後據可靠方面消息、謂當陳在樓下被擊之際、陳子友濤、（現任「維新」偽組織偽「外交部總務司長」）其時正在樓上高臥、驟聞亂槍齊嗚、初尙疑係元旦爆竹之聲、旣聞得樓下嘈雜異響、知有變故、乃急起身奔至扶梯口、將該處裝就之鐵柵緊閉、以防有人衝擁上樓、直待樓下十餘靑年任務　事、扶持保鑣一人遠颺之後、陳子友濤方始倉皇下樓、而其時乃父已身中數槍垂斃於血泊中矣、</p>
<p>陳籙身世</p>
<p>陳字任先、年六十二歲、福建閩侯人、前淸進士、經張之洞之薦、留學法國巴黎大學、嗣充淸翰林院編修、民國後在北京政府外交部充政務司長、外交部次長、復出國先後任墨西哥法國等國公使、自國民政府成立、陳賦閑家居、迨中日戰起、陳與「維新」各要員往返旣多、遂復以衰年失節、竟充偽「外交部長」、此次被殺、頗引起各方之注視、</p>
<p>發現綫索</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、偽「維新政府」「外交部長」陳籙、於星期日（十九日）晚被殺後、公共租界警務處共已抄獲手搶九支、其一經確認為擊斃錢某所用之槍、靜安寺捕房探員於發生槍擊案之當晚、發現手槍三支、相信係保鑣所有者、昨（二十日）晨探員等復赴陳氏寓所附近、沿愚園路一帶各私宅之花園中、大舉搜查、復發現手槍不下六支、</p>
<p>東京反應</p>
<p>海通社二十二日東京電、「維新政府」「外交部長」陳籙被刺之消息、傳至此間後、此間政界人士及輿論、均極為重視、大表震憤、「朝日新聞」要求日本政府、詢問上海工部局、究擬何時、始採取激烈行動、以淸除上海之某種份子、該報認為此類暗殺事件之層見迭出、將使日本與列强尤其英國之關係、大受影響該報主張上海之日本當局、應「掃除上海之反日羣衆」云、</p>
<h3>滬西各偽鎮長　粉墨登塲</h3>
<p>滬西北新涇·華漕·虹橋·漕河涇·等各鄉鎭、自國軍西移後、在日人卵翼下、均有「自治會」之設立、由一班無賴地棍、主持會務、除獻媚敵人、甘作奴隸外、專向商民勒逼捐稅、塡發通行證、（每張三四元不等）橫征暴斂、魚肉鄕民、為唯一之工作、甚至為虎作倀、狼狽為奸、上月間偽「市長」傳筱庵將各處「自治會」改組為「鎮公所」、各「鎭長」由前原任「自治會會長」充任、滬西先劃六區試辦、計北新涇鎭鎭長王鰲、華漕鎭鎮長趙嘉餘、虹橋鎭鎭長胡汀、漕河涇鎮（與龍華合併）鎭長陳琳、曹家渡（與周家橋合併）鎭長管某、法華鎮鎭長陸和、業已發表、於農歷元旦、各鎭長咸粉墨登塲、表演醜劇、又七寳鎭目洽會會長繆志仁、梅隴鎮自治會會長黃俟淸、長橋鎭自治會會長唐林生、以上三鎭現正在計劃進行中、</p>
<h3>農曆新年中　滬郊有游擊戰　虹橋區已作戰三次　圖攻江灣進逼滬東</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨（十七日）得消息、星期四日（十六日）晚與昨（十七日）晨、華方非正規軍與日方巡邏兵、在虹橋區作戰三次、所傳上海日軍控制區內游擊隊復趨活躍之說、因此更可徵信、據可靠方面消息、星期四晚九時十五分、及十一時十五分、居住虹橋與麥克奧特萊路（譯音）近郊之</p>
<p>許多外僑</p>
<p>曾聞沉重之槍聲、昨晨二時二十分、續聞槍聲、同時本埠華方非正式軍、在虹橋區對該地華籍居民、發出警吿謂、入晚八時後、不可出門云云、預料行將到來之廢歷新年中、將續有戰事、日方當局、已禁止在新年內燃放爆竹、關於謠傳星期四日、</p>
<p>日兵兩名</p>
<p>在楊樹浦區被擊斃事、日當局已加吾認、謂該區中並無日兵遭槍擊、但據可靠方面稱、此項謠傳、不無根據、並稱、確實發生之事、乃華方游擊隊取攻勢、圖於星期三至四日攻克江灣、但彼等方開始進攻、日軍援兵調至該地、若干游擊隊發現與己軍隔離、乃</p>
<p>避入東區</p>
<p>而在蘭路河之某橋上、擊斃日兵兩名、然至各捕房探詢、謂關於所傳槍擊日兵事、並無所聞、但信如所傳屬實、則該兩日兵係在接連蘭路與華德路之橋上被擊斃者、蓋若在他橋被擊、則昨日加以詢問之附近若干居民、必聞槍聲也、據華德路一帶居民聲稱、彼等曾閒</p>
<p>似屬炸彈</p>
<p>之爆炸聲、但無確切消息、據昨得消息稱、日當局今在虹橋路·滬杭公路·與中山路、採取特別戒備、且已大舉搜查、短期內將見武裝日兵巡邏、同時傳聞浦東游擊隊、有大規模進攻之可能、續使日當局為之不安、</p>
<h3>南京路上　彈傷日人　路旁有一乞丐　亦被擊傷右腿</h3>
<p>十九日下午一時半左右、本埠南京路突有槍聲、當時適有日籍男女各二人、由酒家餐畢外出、正在等候所雇之億太公司汽車、忽有子彈射來、其中一日女、被子彈射及胸部、擊中乳房、兩男子中一人、則被射及右膊、其一則擦傷右手腕、傷勢輕微、其時路旁有乞丐周雲、南通人、五十歲、亦被擊傷右腿、附近崗捕聞警、當即分頭追捕、因事出倉猝、未有所獲、故初不知放槍者為何許人也、嗣捕房據報、立即嚴密奄緝、一面將受傷者送醫院治療、聞該兩日籍男子、係日方軍報道部職員、</p>
<h3>孩童嬉戲　墜樓跌斃</h3>
<p>住居法租界華格臬路新首安里十七號三樓杜某之五歲男孩祥祥、生來肥嫩可愛、父母鍾愛異常、廢歷歲首（卽十九日）正午十二時、與同居之小孩在三層樓晒臺上嬉玩、不知如何、祥祥忽失足由晒臺上跌至後面夾弄中、撲地時頭顱猛觸水鬥汀地上、登時腦漿迸流、氣息僅續、立即車送醫院求治不及斃命、父母聞信痛哭失聲、幾成瘋顚、</p>
<h3>勞勃生路火警　焚斃一命　一婦人亦灼傷甚重</h3>
<p>昨晚十時許、滬西勞勃生路菜市弄二十一號內、突然起火、頓時火光燭天、濃烟密佈、霎時延燒左右鄰屋、嗣經救火會聞警驅車到塲、竭力施救、的一小時火始熄滅、當火熾時、有一男子未及逃出、被火焚斃、尙有婦人江沈氏從火窟中逃出、被火灼傷極重、經救火會車送廣仁醫院救治、</p>

<h3>春節期間　四郊動態　一股烏烟瘴氣</h3>
<p>廢歷新年三日中、四郊戰區因防游擊隊活動、情勢緊張、居民深居簡出、街道上因僅有之若干小商店休業、行人稀少、景象凄凉、各情分紀如决、</p>
<p>居民爭扯荒謬春聯　南市·閘北·浦東·滬西各區、巳經有人居住之一小部份街道上、所開若干商店、因循舊例休業三天、偽「市府」為乘此機會獻媚起見、於事先印就大批紅底黑字不倫不類之春聯、强貼各店舖及住戶門上、詞句計分三種、多含反動意議、姑抄錄三聯、以見荒謬一斑、　「親仁善鄰·同歌樂土」、「安良除暴·共慶新年」、「　抗戰力衰·舊政已去一、安居心定·新業振興」、　「旭日高懸·歡騰五挨」、「一年好景·人樂三春、但貼出未久、即被人爭先扯去、</p>
<p>烟賭猖獗無異魔窟　在此三百日中、烟賭三項、在浪人偽員、流氓勾串下、應時而興、與原有之燕子窠白粉窠及大小賭窟競攬主顧、爭奪營業、完全公開性質、無人干涉、甚目街道之上、賭攤林立、引誘無知愚民、用種種技倆、詐騙金錢、故四郊遍地烏烟瘴氣、身入其境、無異走入魔窟</p>
<p>日軍防範水陸仍通　日軍因四郊謠諑繁　、深恐遊擊隊乘機活動、不得不從事小心防範、在沿浦江兩岸各渡口、及陸地上重要公路橋樑要道、均加派哨兵防守、對出入居民、搜查綦　、無偽「市民證」不能通過、惟水陸舟車交通、均勉强維持行駛、但乘客稀少、收人銳减、日偽損失頗重、</p>

<h3>傷風咳嗽盛行　氣候急變的賜予　「威靈」良藥奏速效</h3>
<p>傷風咳嗽一症我國人患者甚多，而以氣候急變之時令為最，因短時期內，通常無性命之憂，故人人視為無足重輕之些微小病，任其自生自愈，其實星星之火，可以燎原，各種急性傳染病，如肺炎等，往往由極平常之傷風咳嗽而起，肺癆一症，允以咳嗽為初步，危險已不堪設想，即或釀成慢性氣管炎，變為老年咳嗽，哮喘痰湧，苦不勝言，故歐美人士，視傷風咳嗽為毒蛇猛獸，一經初起，立即診治，俾吿速痊，普通藥品中有白松糖漿一種，為天然治咳之良劑，蓋白松盛產歐洲北部，歐人患肺病者，輒坐臥於白松林，吸取其芳香之氣，即奏奇效，於是製成糖漿，遠輸國外，以惠同病，但單純白松糖漿，功效尙不顯著，威靈藥行，特按照我國人體質，配以君臣佐使，製成複方白松糖漿，功能化痰止咳，鎭痙平喘，芬芳適口，老幼咸宜，以較單純白松糖漿，效力奚啻倍蓰，患傷風咳嗽之人，幸勿猶豫，急速購服威靈複方白松糖漿，每瓶定價一元，特價七角五分，二馬路英華街口正威大藥房發售，電話九二五二五，購買不取送力，</p>

<h3>偽「市府」撤消　水上救護隊　封鎖綫水流湍急溺水將無人援救</h3>

<p>科學與人生</p>
<h3>科學敎師成功的條件</h3>
<p>— 尙堯</p>
<p>一個成功的科學敎師，對於自己所專門的學科當然用功研究，但是對於其他的科學門類也博覽旁通。</p>
<p>他懂得如何敎，並如何敎科學。</p>
<p>他能暢達他自己的意思。他在講台上和實騐室裏隨時有豐富的資料，兩隻手更能做得老練而精巧。他能管理儀器，更能管理人羣的秩序。</p>
<p>他具有哲學的風度。他也通曉歷史，能和靑年學生們坐集一室，娓娓談話伽利略，牛頓，法拉第，達爾文等諸先哲的一生事蹟。</p>
<p>此外，他更富於責任心，對於自己的工作有自信力。</p>
<p>一個科學敎師或許會有第一等的實騐室，充裕的時間和理想的計劃，但是除非他眞正知道如何敎學和熱心敎學，决沒有成功的希望。反過來說，假使他眞是熱心而又好學的，雖沒有良好的設備也會成功。</p>
<p>成功與否全在乎人，一切困難是都可以打破的。</p>
<h3>棉衣棉褲</h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>「全家都在風聲裏，九月衣裳未剪裁。」這是淸代詩人的名句：詩人的雅骨不能傲風，風雅只好暫時不談，且談談切身的禦寒問題。</p>
<p>我眞佩服畜生，牠們到了天寒的時候沒有絨衫大衣等等麻煩事情。牠們用什麼方法禦寒呢？就吾人肉眼的簡單觀察所及，誰都知道牠們有的是羽毛，但是誰都得懷疑，牠們何以能冬夏無別呢？實際上有的畜生能依寒暑而掉換其羽或毛，有的畜生却另有辦法。牠們只要把毛層裏所含的「不動空氣」，加以改變，或增加其容量，或减少其容量，就是調節寒暑的辦法。因為空氣是不大傳熱的，所以毛層裏的空氣加厚，瞪溫容易保留就是對付天寒的辦法，而毛層裏的空氣减薄，體溫較易發散，就是對付天熱的辦法。試想全身的毛平舖在皮膚上時，與全身的毛直立在皮膚上時，互相比較其所含空氣之多少，我們不難明白，直立時所含的空氣總比較的多。所以畜生的禦寒辦法之一，就在「舉毛」。皮膚裏毛根附近處有一條肌肉，呌「舉毛肌」，利用牠的收縮就把毛舉了起來。</p>
<p>我們人類有毛嗎？有，太少一點。有舉毛肌嗎？有，同毛的多少大概一樣。「北風寒起栗」，我們試披襟當之，大家都會發見皮膚上起了一顆一顆的小疙瘩，就如鷄皮一樣。這是舉毛肌收縮的結果。不過人體的毛已經退化，所以舉毛肌雖克盡厥職而仍無補於事。因此，我們為取得一層防寒的空氣起見，就要借重畜生的毛——皮貨——或他種含有多量空氣的材料，如呢絨等類，這是狐裘煌煌或大衣裏體的先生女士們所親自試騐過的。衣服禦寒的理由就在乎此。</p>
<p>生理學有一術語：「衣服與食料同價」。這是說，假定天寒不穿衣服，體溫不免大大的損失，而我們補充這損失的辦法，離不了多吃點東西。換句話說，如果我多穿了衣服，體溫得以保留，那些為賠償損失而多吃的東西就可以不必吃了，所以說，衣服與那些東西的價値是相同的。於是聰明朋友來了；他穿上皮袍，裏上棉衾，安臥於楠木之棺，外加上陰沉之槨，他說，身外的不動空氣富足有餘，體溫自然萬無一失，就此可以謝絕飮食，安度寒冬。然而他不到一小時而汗出如漿，不到一整天而飢腸雷鳴（棺村蓋當然沒有蓋上）。汗出如漿的理由說來話長，就此帶住。至於飢腸雷鳴顯然證明了食物的使命不止一端，除了與衣服同價的一部份外，尙有其他非衣服所能代替的使命。關於食物的使命也只好帶住。可是我們已經明白，衣服不能取食料而代之，只能在某種條件下與之同價。倒過來說食料也一樣：食料不能取衣服而代之（指禦寒），只能在某種條件下與之同價。所以赤身裸體游北極，雖跟隨着任有多少的滿漢行厨也難免凍死。</p>
<p>也許有人要問，何種材料的衣服，何種式樣的衣服，方合乎科學呢？</p>
<p>哦！在舉國一致的節的口號之下，我的回答是如此簡單：禦寒的單位是棉衣棉褲。</p>

<h3>科學聊齋</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>黑礦</p>
<p>馬可波羅初來中國，見中國人用煤燃火，頗為驚異，在其著述中稱中國人能利用一種黑礦（Black　mineral）而收火之效力。其時歐洲不知煤之作用，文化程度，遠遜於中華民族。數百年後，科學發達，歐洲竟變成一種新世界，而吾國竟以科學落後，受制於人，可為浩嘆！</p>
<p>大老妖</p>
<p>民國初年，北平南下窪地方，夜間聞見一種鳥聲，甚為奇異，遲之日久，卒未見有何物，後因夜夜聞之，居民惴惴以為妖異，警察局派隊偵索，於叢葦中發見一大鳥，白色，喙下懸一大囊，鮮紅色，臨風張喙，其囊膨脹，鳴聲一作，與夜間所聞者相同，振翼飛去，見者稱為大老妖，一時各報盛載之。此鳥名鵜鶘，又名淘河（Pelican），在北方河流所在之處多有之。性食魚，與魚鷹同科，以喙下大囊在水中撈魚，如拖網然，此乃普通之鳥，惜不常見於城市之中，居人指為妖異，殊可哂已。</p>
<p>蛙異</p>
<p>往時北平城內驟見蛙類千萬隻，由某一處向別處結隊而行，歷數晝夜而不休，居人咸以為不吉之兆。蓋其時雨量頗大，與往年春旱不同。蛙產卵甚多，天旱則多數乾死，僅發達至蝌蚪時期，亦以缺乏水及食而夭折。故每年之蛙較少。乃是年因雨水過勤，多數卵及蝌蚪皆得長成，老蛙少蛙以居處擁擠，遂相率喬遷，唯以其數過多，遂竟有以上所言之現象，與吉凶禍福無涉也。</p>
<p>老處女之興邦</p>
<p>達爾文嘗謂英國各處紫雲英之蕃茂，因蜂類繁多，助其雜交。蜂類之繁多，因鼠類之减少，以鼠足以害蜂也。鼠類之减少，則以猫之增多，以猫喜捕殺鼠類也。猫之增多，則以各處之老處女最喜養猫之故，即此足見生物彼此之間，實佈成關係之網。佛克特氏（Vogt）謂十九世紀中，英倫以紫雲英之繁殖，畜牧之革塲甚富，牛肉至美且廉，人人得而食之，英人之心力體力，皆特別發達。科學發明，幾日有所聞，工商事業，日形膨脹，探險成續亦甚佳。英人勢力遍於全球，為世界一等强國矣。</p>
<h3>人體摩托船快哉快哉！</h3>
<p>— 葉人</p>
<p>一隻小船的屁般上裝了一具小汽油機和葉子推進器，就可變做一隻摩托船，那末一個會游泳的人身上裝了同樣的一具推進機，豈不也可變成一隻摩托船嗎？實際上這個玩意兒已有人做過，據説去年夏天在美國米阿米海濱十分流行。游水在背腰上裝了小小的一具推進機，用四肢做舵，轉彎自如，速度極高　君琪繪圖</p>
<h3>這是什麽？</h3>
<p>— （美國航空雜誌）</p>
<p>看去好像是一隻挖泥機或者一架打穀機，是不是？實際上這是一隻飛機。它的確能够飛行，而且據它的發明者近在紐的試騐，它能筆直向上飛，還能翺翔於空中好多時呢。</p>
<h3>自火山噴出的資財</h3>
<p>— 希微</p>
<p>火山爆發確是摧毀生命財產的巨災，但是它能將地球內部的蘊藏移到地面，供給地面上的生物利用，其賜福於生物之功確也不小。</p>
<p>火山自它的烟囱內送出的贈品，花樣繁多，上自金和鑽石以至塵埃和可飲的水無所不有。</p>
<p>有許多金屬，尤其是較重和較稀有的，常常發現於大量的火山岩中。其原因由於它們在地面下極深的地方給酸蒸汽溶解，復被帶至近地面的地點，然後留在該處變成濃厚狀態，供我們應用。</p>
<p>許多非金屬也同出於一源，以硫最為顯著。其决較不顯著而較為重要者為氯氣，它是火山呼出的一部分氣體，而我們生活所不可少的鹽，即由它和鈉化合而成的。</p>
<p>自火山中噴出一切流體中之最豐富者是一種最普通的化合物——水。水是岩石晶體組織的一部。當岩石在火山爆發的進程中受到化學的分解時，這種年久被石所束縛的水也被解放，向地面逃遁。</p>
<p>在火山烟囱內更放出對於生命極重要的另外一種氣體。它和人造烟囱內吐出的氣體相同，即是二氧化碳。它被植物吸取後，耶開始製造食物。它在動物體內與磷和鈣化合，成為骨和貝壳。最後珊瑚和珠的發源，我們也不能不歸到火山。</p>
<h3>科學書報介紹中國森林植物誌</h3>
<p>— 闕疑生</p>
<p>錢崇澍主編，中國科學社生物硏究所，經濟部林墾署合印，民國26年12月出版，定價國幣二元，代售處上海，福煦路649號，中國科學圖書儀器公司。</p>
<p>我國高等植物分類學，經十餘年來若干學者之努力，慚具頭緒，不僅在學術上多所貢獻，亦且探得吾國植物資源之所在，於國家經濟建設，抗戰前途關係至鉅。</p>
<p>因硏究成績斐然，故論著亦特多，除多種研究論文外，專刋之作，所在多有？最早有陳煥鏞氏之中國經濟樹木誌，决有胡先　，陳煥鏞二氏合編之中國植物圖譜（已出四册），近來又有陳嶸氏之中國樹木誌等書問世，皆為極有價値之科學著作。惟此等專刊，多由學理方面著眼，對於所描述之樹木的經濟用途，少加注意，求其旣重學理而又兼及經濟價値者，則錢氏此書，堪稱其選。</p>
<p>本書編輯計劃，雖未明白揭示，但就體制上可以看出係依植物分類學之系統，挑選吾國森林植物之重要者加以叙述，每五十種合為一册，先作植物學名之考定，詳徵文典，决作形態之描叙，决論在吾國之地理分佈，决詳其繁殖及栽培與造林之價値，最後窮究其多種經濟用途，根皮花葉種子木材無不加以詳細推敲，何者可供造紙原料，何者可為飛機材料，何者可作傢具，何者可造軍艦，車輛，種子或可榨油，或可供食用，花葉或供觀賞，或製香料藥品等等，無不應詳盡詳。讀者於閱覽每種植物描述後，即明瞭該植物之各種經濟用途，與在國防建設上之價値，不僅為農林學校之良好敎本，實為造林及從事植物生產者不可或缺之參考書。</p>
<p>本書之另一特色為凡所論述之植物，均附有繪製極精之圖版，除葉莖畢眞而外，花卉菓實均作放大之解剖，便於學者辨認。至於印刷之精美，用紙之優良，有目共睹，母待贅述，惟略有排印上之錯誤，不難辨正。</p>

<h3>上海灘民救濟恊會發表　勸募難民生產敎育經費宣言　敎育界自動提議捐學校補助費一成</h3>
<p>上海難民救濟協會敎育組勸募委員會發起勸墓難民生產敎育經費、已得全市敎育界及學生家屬之贊助、開始慕集、茲錄該會發出「舉辦難民生產與敎育募捐宣言」於下，</p>
<p>勸募宣言</p>
<p>在上海各收容所的難胞據最近統計還有的十萬人、內中成人的六萬三千、兒童的三萬七千、這個數目不可謂不大、這許多難胞救濟費的籌措當然成為絕大的問題、但上海有四百萬的人口、以四百萬的居民救濟十萬的難胞、祇要每個人都肯量力捐輸、亦不是十分困難的事、而且是我們在這非常時期分內應盡的責任、本市敎育界文化界同人以及二十萬的靑年學生在以往對於難民救濟事業巳經有了很大的努力、但難民問題一天不解决、我們的責任便一天未了、今後的繼續捐輸仍有待於我敎育界文化界同人以及親愛的靑年學生額努力、</p>
<p>就難民救濟工作而論、最低限度須使難胞不受飢寒、不致流離失所、換句話說、就是難胞的給養、但僅養而不敎是絕對不够的、除給養而外我們須設法增進難胞的智能、培養難胞的生產能力、所一難民敎育的設施和生產技能的訓練是十分重要而迫切的、難民總有遣散的一日、總有回鄕的一天、我們假使不趁這個時候施以相當的敎育、授以生產的技能、那麼遣散以後、回鄕以後、難胞的生活問題仍舊得不到解决、所以祇有敎養兼施才是積極的澈底的救濟、</p>

<h3>精彩籃球表演賽　華大勝百樂門　名不虛傳球藝卓絕結果六二比五四分</h3>
<p>美國華盛頓大學籃球隊（即西雅圖業餘體育協會代表隊）於十八日晨（星期六）搭淺間丸輪由港抵滬、一行八人、由隊長羅斯溫納管理雷夫卡奈率領、當晚八時、即在西靑籃球房與百樂門隊作表演比賽、華大球藝、果然各不虛傳、表演出神入化、上半時以三十九比十五大勝、下半時百樂門努力反攻、華大攻守亦較鬆懈、結果六十二比五十四、百樂門僅負八分、西靑籃球房、慕名前往欣賞球藝者、上下擠得水洩不通、為申報杯賽後之第一决盛况、該隊全體於决日十九日搭原輪赴日、前往火奴魯魯、再返美國、在日比賽與吾、刻尙未定、</p>
<p>談話　據該隊管理雷夫卡奈吿記者稱、此决赴菲、係應菲律賓籃球協會之邀請、為美國籃球隊東遊之技藝與實力最强者、在菲共賽十五决、戰無不勝、僅日本大學聯合隊、最初稍有競爭、入後即被其控制、該隊於十二月二十三日離西雅園赴菲、預算於三月初返美、在日本或將與日本聯大隊再賽、在火奴魯魯則將有二决比賽云、</p>
<p>球藝　該隊全體隊員、體格莫不魁偉異常、身高俱在六呎以上、全隊合作、速度、投籃工夫、俱臻化境、較前决之南太平洋隊更高一籌、其進攻方法、完全採用極美妙之碍法Blocking覓取空隙、後衛更自後跟進、投籃阻不拘角度、板下之連續投擲、尤為巧妙、守則用各個防守法、但並不指定死釘、隨機應變、到處見其『余蟬脫殼』、全隊以惠格納、洛夫列區、及B愛格三人最為出色、</p>
<p>比賽　百樂門上塲、全失敗於慌張混亂、一任華大蹂躪、幾無招架之力、進攻則亦一籌莫展、有球無路、蔡演雄先以罰球連中開紀錄、繼達云亦中、百樂門第二度以四比三佔先、從此一直落後、上半時成三十九比十五、相差達二十四分、下半時百樂門以賈幼良入代陳祥龍、果然連得七分、追成二十二比三十九、再以許文奎入代周達雲、文奎之遠射、如得神助、連連進籃、五十一比三十二時、學崇文奎幼良、全力反攻、一再中的、華大攻守、亦較鬆弛、分數愈追愈近、結果成五十八比五十、百樂門雖敗猶榮也、裁判員白朗及康拉特、</p>

<h3>上海敎育界　改革敎育意見　改進我國師範敎育的意見（上）　吳增芥</h3>
<p>小學校是實施國民敎育的塲所、受這種敎育的兒童、年齡是六歲到十二歲、正需要優良敎師的敎誨、和培育、使他具有健全的體魄、活潑的精神、實用的知能、良好的習慣、敎育是立國之本、國家的榮枯視國民的敎育程度而分別、故欲求國家的强盛非致力於敎育的發展不可、在各級敎育中、小學的階段、是一個始基、自應加以軍視、我們耍希望有完善的小學、就應注意造就良好的師資、目前的敎育制度、以師範畢校為訓練小學師資的機關、師範學校猶如母親、小學譬如兒子、母體的健康與吾、直接影饗到嬰兒的身心、所以我們不欲改良小學敎育則已、如果要改進的話、師範敎育、便不容漠視、我對於師範敎育改進的意見、可分為下面的幾點、</p>
<p>養成學生勤勞的習慣現時的師範生、即未來的小敎師、小學敎師工作繁重、生淸苦、非習於勤勞者不克勝任、過去師範學校的學生、除少數設在鄕村者外、都缺少勞動的訓練、若干城市里的學校、校舍設備、講究得很、學生過着舒適的生活、且不免沾染都市的奢侈、浮囂的氣味、城市師範學校的畢業生、多不肯在鄕村小學服務、我以為今後師範學校、一律要設在鄕間、使學生常與樸索的鄕村環境接觸、學校生活、以勞動為主、養成克苦耐勞的精神、俾不致視小學敎育事業為畏途、况且今後的小學、鄕村的需要尤大於城市、師範學校設在鄕間、可使學生多獲農事方面的知識、以增加服務鄕小的效率、</p>
<p>增加專業訓練時間</p>
<p>師範敎育、可分普通的和專業的兩方面、前者包括閱讀·書寫計算·體育·音樂·勞作·史地·科學知識等、後者則指小學敎學技術、小學敎材的編選、敎育和心理學的知識等而言、巳往的師範學校、普通敎育、還沒什麼問題、爾專業訓練、殊嫌不足、尤以小學敎學技術的訓練、更感缺乏、以致師範生畢業後服務小學、仍不免茫無頭緒、暗中摸索、這種情形、我們只能歸咎於師範專業訓練的不充分、而不能責備師範畢業生的、今後師範學校的最後一年、應完全從事於小學敎學、行政的實習、和敎材的試作等、使學生對於小學的實際工作、不但澈底的明瞭、而且眞正會做、假如因增加專業訓練而影響到普通敎育，那末師範修業期限、就有延長的必要、（未完）</p>

<h3>「意思很平凡」</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>廢曆新年中最重大的五件事，也許就是蔣委員長在第三屆參政會議席上的演說吧。他反覆地說明，對日决不妥洽，勗勉國民始終以國家民族的利益為第一，積極抗戰救國。他自謙說，他的話「意思很平凡」。</p>
<p>我們看，他的話果然平凡麽？當然，他並沒有什麼新奇的理論，來震動人的耳目，要說平凡，也的確是平凡的。但是我們知道，平凡並不就是不重要，適得其反，天下事往往最平凡者，却最為重要，正如水火的平凡，人却不能一日離水火而生活。</p>
<p>蔣委員長這决的霄論，據我看，一方面重申抗戰的决心，剷除了和平的腐念，一方面提醒國人，不要日久玩生，忘了當前的艱難，意思儘管是老生常談，平凡得很，而在這第二期抗戰開始時，意義却很重大。假使人人能够記在心中，並且予以實行，那末，勝利的希望，就一定能够實現了。</p>
<p>除了這國家大事以外，社會上，以及個人方面，任何事也莫不皆然：儘有許多原則，說來意思很平凡，人人能够懂得，而其關係的重大，却遠過於其表面的平凡。例如節的一端，誰不知道牠的理論和實踐的方法，可是能够眞正實踐的，允其在這廢曆新年中，又有多少人呢？這幾天我們的耳目所接觸到的，那一樣是合乎節的的？那末，也就難怪蔣委員長夫婦要在電台上重行廣播節的救國的意義，而社會上有識之士，更不惜舌敝唇焦，一再大聲疾呼了。</p>
<p>現在，我們的領袖要我們合力抗戰，我們自己也决意合力抗戰。說起來簡直卑之無甚高論就只在我們的埋頭苦幹。假使誰要是忘了，我希望大家彼此提醒一下；誰要是實行得不努力，我希望大家彼此督促一下。用不着唱高調，更不要顧忌什麽平凡不平凡！</p>
<h3>白楊樹下</h3>
<p>— 亞德</p>
<p>剛跑進這鋪着石子路的弄堂，老遠就望見一株兩丈來高的白楊樹，筆直的站在圍牆裹面。這白楊樹，在最近四年之中，我幾乎沒有隔過一個星期不跟它見面，因為自從小陳搬到這弄裏來居住之後，我隔不了三五天就要來探望他一趟。</p>
<p>這一天我又照例跑到小陳家裏來，老遠就望見白楊樹已經在落葉了，面目看來有點憔悴。我在鐵門邊按了門鈴。</p>
<p>鐵門開了，我跑了進去。在院子裏除了矮小淸瘦的小陳之外，白楊樹底下還站着一位穿藍布長袍的高個子。這高個子有兩隻發亮的眼睛，鬍子茸茸地，却沒有遮掩住他的年靑的姿態。</p>
<p>小陳瞧見我緊瞪住這陌生的客人，便微笑地拍着我的肩頭介紹着：「建仁，這位就是我提起過的老平。」</p>
<p>這陌生客人，急遽地伸出他的手，我機械地握住它。小陳又朝着我說話：</p>
<p>一老平，建仁是我的老同學，前兩天才從江北來。…時間過得眞快，我們已經分離將近八年了呢，八年前的生活，現在回想起來，還像是昨天的事五樣。」</p>
<p>小陳得意忘形的說着，大家的脚步慢慢地移近白楊樹。那陌生的客人，用他的手親切地撫摸着光滑的樹身。</p>
<p>「我們還是到屋子裹去吧！」小陳推着我們，向前跑。</p>
<p>「不，」陌生的客人拒絕了：「我愛這白楊，我們還是站在這兒來得舒適。我留在這兒就只有兩天，回到家鄉之後，誰也不曉得什麽時候我們才再見。」</p>
<p>他說得很自然，但有些感傷。我想立刻問他，他到底回家鄉幹什麼去？却給彼此的緘默壓住了，我沒有開口發問。我只微抬起頭仰視這陌生的高個子，他眼睛望着灰闇的天際，粗大的手正撫摸白楊樹幹。</p>
<p>「建仁，你回鄉後該如何做起呢？」</p>
<p>小陳邊說，邊掏出烟盒來，我們每人取了一支，燃了火抽着，讓烟霧隨着風兒，在空際飄盪。</p>
<p>「先從訓練部隊着手。」那多末洪亮的聲音！「我是一個死裏逃生的人，不怕什麽死的了，…可是，這白楊樹，不知怎的，我一見就鍾愛了它，倒似乎有點不大捨得遠離它。」</p>
<p>「哪！你跟老平正有同好。」小陳的的笑聲，衝破了嚴肅的空氣。</p>
<p>我立刻追問着，「死裏逃生到底是什麽意思。」</p>
<p>這决回答的不是建仁，却是小陳。他說：建仁是個速長，南京因戰略關係放棄的時候，他跟另外的四百多個戰士就成了俘虜，給粗索縛了雙手，用機關槍作集體掃射之後，還一個一個用刀刺着，又再拿手溜彈丟在屍堆中；他睡在死屍中，聽血流如瀑布般的傾瀉着，他聞到强烈的血腥味，他沒有想起他底死活。過了好些時候，他才感到自己還活着，就用力掙扎，把粗索脫掉了，帶着肩頭的刀傷，在曠野裏亡命的趕路，穿過亂人的防綫，受盡凍餓，整整三天後，才安然到了一個遊擊區裹。因為烽火已在家鄉燃起來了，他才决定南下，回家鄕去發動遊擊戰。</p>
<p>這故事像一團火，燒着我的心；叉好像一首詩，我覺得一字一句都非常刺激</p>
<p>就在第二天的晚上，我們沽了幾斤酒，買了些菜，三個人坐在白楊樹下，邊談邊喝，作為建仁的餞行酒。建仁的酒量很豪，一盅一盅直向喉裏倒，酒喝得多，話也談得多，不知怎的，我感到一股非常親切的味兒，我想把他抱着吻着，我愛他的眼睛，也愛他茸茸的鬍子。</p>
<p>月亮已經昇上來，但是只有像香蕉那樣的小半爿。建仁望着月亮，伸長頸項說着：「現在我們和平的生活，已經消失了，要待抗戰勝利建國完成之後，才能恢復這個，我多愛恬靜而和平的生活啊！」</p>
<p>建仁的話正打在我們的心坎裏，我低着頭不說什麽話，小陳却呆呆地注視着他。過了半晌，小陳原說：</p>
<p>「老平，建仁明天走了，我們要到碼頭去送行。」</p>
<p>送行？我頂怕的是送朋反遠行，特別是一個心愛的朋友。我登時堅决地拒絕了小陳；可是我並不遮掩，我坦白地說出不送行的原因。我站了起來，跑前去握緊建仁的手，我囁嚅的說，「朋友，我們相見似很偶然又很容易，但是別時可就有點依依不捨了。不過，我能够阻止你回家鄉麼？不可能的，不可能的！」</p>
<p>建仁和小陳愕然的望着我。我却像失了知覺似地，佇立在白楊樹旁。</p>

<h3>猜德國「新書」</h3>
<p>— 王隱</p>
<p>報載海通社訊：德國去年出版新書，數量居世界第一位，計二五四〇〇册。</p>
<p>這眞値得我們羨慕。不過也不能不呌我們奇怪的是：德國自從成了希特勒天下以後，只聽見不停地燒書，所毀的書底「數量」倒是「居世界第一位」，怎麼忽然郤又這樣大量地出起書來了呢？</p>
<p>自然，通訊上說得明白：出的是「新書」。燒了舊的，便不能不出新的。不錯，對得很。但我們却忍不住又要問一下：在一年中所出的這樣多的「新書」到底都是些甚麽書呢？</p>
<p>我們雖然住得遠，但却已經從電報中大概知道了過去德國所燒的書都是些甚麽書。這回出版的「新書」雖然還沒有見說明是那些種類，但我們要猜出一個大概，却也不難。</p>
<p>現在，我且來猜一下，把這二五四〇〇册的新書」底種類試給開一個統計表如下：</p>
<p>誇希特勒及國社黨　一〇〇〇〇册</p>
<p>駡社會主義及蘇聯　五〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>呌婦女回到厨房去　一〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>講奧國即是德國　三〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>說捷克須受德國保護　三〇〇〇册</p>
<p>指猶太人都是壞蛋　三〇〇〇冊</p>
<p>論烏克蘭有五十萬日耳曼人　四〇〇册</p>
<p>總數：二五四〇〇冊</p>
<p>我敢說，我這個表一定是相當正確的。</p>
<p>但倘是還要問：這些書的讀者底「數地」是怎樣呢？那却就成了難答的問題。不過却也可以猜出一個大概。那便是：讀者底「數量」要是和書底「數量」一比較起來時，那現象也一定是「居世界第一位」的。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>在反覆爭辯之下，葉團長才有些心軟下來。恰好梁團附朱參謀也來勸阻，於是他也就不再固執，决定撤退，只是撤退到那裏去，却也頗成問題。</p>
<p>『現在我們已經和後方失去了聯絡，東南北三面都被敵人封鎖住了，只有西面靠太湖這一隻死角可退。我的意思，不如就向西退去，化整為零，把正規軍改成游擊隊，分散埋伏，控制住鐵路錢一帶的大鎮，一面隨時襲擊敵人，一面普遍組織民衆武力，再徐圖規復。』梁團附提議說。</p>
<p>『打游擊固然是我們今後唯一的出路，不過也得找一個根據地才行。』朱參謀帶些提醒意味的說。</p>
<p>『那麼就退到合浦鎭去罷。』葉團長輕鬆地吐了一口氣：『合浦鎮是我的故鄕，到那裏，軍隊的給養比較有辦法，雖然地方稍為僻遠一些，却是個很好的根據地。』</p>
<p>大家都表示了同意。剩下來的部隊還有兩營不足一些，於是便令戰鬥力較弱的一營在前綫担任掩護，且戰且退，另外精銳的一營，則連同武器和輜重，用急行軍退向合浦鎭去。</p>
<p>那時合浦鎭正受了戰局變化的影響，陷於不安慌亂之中，鄉公所裏定的那份老申報已有多天不來了，大家得不到正確的消息，便只好互相打聽。而且鎭上並沒有傑出的有見識的人物出來領導，所以大家除了相對着急以外，也沒有什麼辦法。</p>
<p>葉團長就在這時，率部到來。他離家前後還不過十天，這番重來，戰局却已起了重大的變化，眞是「風景不殊，舉目有河山之異，」使他的心頭很覺感慨。在將耍到鎭時，他下令部隊暫時駐紥在鎭外，不許進鎭，以免驚動民衆，他自己只和梁團附趙營長朱參謀三人，一同到鎭上鄉公所去訪鎭長陳兆前。</p>
<p>陳鎭長見葉團長和三位軍官同來，便知道戰局有些不妙，一時心慌意亂，連忙問道：『前方的情形怎樣了？』</p>
<p>葉團長也來不及和他細說，只呌他趕快去召集鎭上全體民衆。陳鎮長不敢怠慢，連忙把棄置在塵灰中的一面舊銅鑼找了出來，就呌打雜的到門外去敲。</p>
<p>「鍠鍠鍠！」緊急而又響亮的銅鑼聲，把全鎭民衆都驚動了，大家一齊停下了手裏的工作，跑向鄉公所來，連素來不常上街的葉老先生，也捧着水烟袋慢騰騰的踱了來。</p>
<p>『方俊，』老先生在鄉公所裏意外地發現了葉團長，不禁驚異地呌了起來，隨即問他道：『你怎麼回來了？前方的情形怎樣？』</p>
<p>葉團長向他父親作了個手勢，呌他暫慢動問。他看見鄉公所裏來的人漸漸多了，便開始跳到一張凳上去，向他們說道：（一七）</p>

<h3>由投機白熱化所造成　畸形繁榮之上海孤島　就表面觀之固欣欣向榮　從內骨觀之實處處斵傷</h3>
<p>投機之動機</p>
<p>上海各交易所、受戰事影響、於八一三以後一律停市、各投機份子頓失其投機之淵藪、在平時、卽證券及紗布兩交易所之每日交易之價值、恒各有數千萬元之鉅、自失去其投機之目標後、即有大量國幣流出國外、此在投機份子一方言之不過轉移目標物、顧猶是向來固投機作風、然而國家受其影響則已甚鉅、其愛國思想之薄弱、遠不及其圖利觀念之深厚默察基本原因、一般接近外人之神經過敏者、咸恐國家戰時財力、容有不足、於是投機外滙之風大熾、</p>
<p>外匯投機</p>
<p>投機份子、其投機外滙者之心理不外二種、其一即一般與外人相接近者、神經過敏、咸惴惴焉惟恐國家戰時財力之衰弱、而至於通貨膨脹、或將形成國幣市值之跌落、一轉移間、其財產已因改換國籍而得有保障、同時外滙滙兌市值之漲跌觀測、亦利於做多、其二爲洋貨商之預爲存儲、其表面爲防　滙兌漲跌之虧耗而實際則亦含有第一種同樣之大量投機性、餘則拋賣以及各國貨幣之套利、均與交易所投機買賣相等、政府　則對於需要外滙者無量供給、繼因國幣之大量流出而加之限制、於是引起中外銀行對於同一貨幣、其滙兌價有顯著的懸殊、</p>
<p>西藥商及金融界</p>
<p>自滬戰內移之後、上海已形成孤島、西藥商鑒於戰事之延長、其資本雄厚者、即爭先大量向國外訂定各種中國所無而又必需要之種種藥品、以備缺貨及漲價損耗之預爲儲藏、此種獲利、一方爲利便病人、一方則營業方面不致失算、且在滙兌上得意外鉅大之盈餘、當此時期之金融界、因內地資產階級之會集滬上、各銀行之存款、乃有鉅量之增加、此種游資、在此非常時期、竟無妥善方法、充份利用以生利、除少數供給工業及實業之用外、大部份則結進外滙、其數量及盈餘之多少、各隨其財力及眼光爲斷、是以一年中盈餘之多者達千萬、而一般小銀行、則因無信用力吸收存款、乃非特不能獲得此意外之利潤、而反有倒閉之虞、其餘私人獲得外滙之利者、尚不在此數、</p>
<p>標金及貨幣</p>
<p>八一三以前之標金標、比之目下之標金價、每條高漲八九百元、八一三以前、外國紙幣及硬幣價、比之現在、其漲額相差、亦有百分之七八十、其猛漲之狂烈、無非由於資產階級之儲藏、投機之熱、不亞於外滙之烈、不過一則往往僅有數字之表示於契約、一則乃係實貨買賣之交易、惟小民則非特不得享受此種絲毫權利、而間接的反更受到物價抬高之損害、長袖善舞、且亦善同其機也、</p>
<p>公債與紗花</p>
<p>公債及紗花兩市塲、雖於八一三以後停頓、而其暗盤買賣、於戰事內移後、漸漸萌芽、逐步擴大、由不規則之後亦漸具規則、其買賣數量、因受現款之拘束、雖不及從前開市時之鉅大、但亦相當可觀、其上落之數字、公債約居市價百分之五六十、紗花約居百分之四五十、花衣上落較小、此種實貨之投機或居奇、大都經營紗花者比公債爲優、但投機多係一般向來熟悉此道者、各依其固有之眼花爲買賣、不過範圍已經縮小、而外行則甚少在此中討生活者、是以各紗廠、因實力之未全消滅、而得復業者、其獲利之厚、亦遠在一般人意料之外、（參觀紗花業另條）</p>
<p>五金與建築材料</p>
<p>五金因戰事需要及來路不易、其漲價之高昂、至可驚人、靑鈴一項、因有特別需要、而又最感缺貨、市價逐步飛騰、竟漲至百分之千分以上、而猶不易得貨、（得享此種權利者、爲本業及金融界居多）、其餘各種、亦各隨其需要之緩急、而互有等差、但至少亦漲起百分之五十、建築材料、以各種銅骨、最爲一般本業經營商居爲奇貨、存貨雖多、而甘願回絕主顧、以待善價、故一般普通　建築家、每因無法得其所需要之銅骨、而未能擴大其營業、其次爲各種木料、最普通之洋松一種、一時亦不易求得大數、餘若磚瓦水泥等、亦因新建築之勃興、營業無不特別發達、有在上海四周淪陷區內運出殘破磚瓦、亦無不得善價、</p>
<p>旅館及二房東</p>
<p>八一三以前之旅館業、無不以减價廣告爲號召、戰事初興、小型旅館之倒閉或招盤者、所在皆是、戰事內移後、上海人口劇增、各旅館乃家家客滿、且更有暗中增價者、有以少數資本、盤進小旅館者、年獲利一倍至三倍不等、二房東之精於計劃者、一幢或兩幛之屋、最普通可住房客七八家、或十餘家、除二房東自家居住外月可得數十元或一二百元之意外收入、而二房東猶可居熱心調劑一般人住的問題之美名、其有自居住　屋、全部出頂都、少則數百元、多則數千元不等、爲一次意外不規則的獲得、</p>
<p>菜館腦顱食物店</p>
<p>菜館生意之鼎盛、至足令人傷感不置、在此非常時期、全滬四百餘萬人口必有半數以上爲失業者、一般人雖獲有職業、多數不過勉强在此高生活中糊口、甚至有朝不保暮者、宜若此等菜館業、當屬有减無增、不料有出乎任何人所不及逆料者、非特無减、而劇增之盛、較之八一三前更有驚人之發展、內地各處之菜館平時稍具名望、無不在英法兩租界內、出重價覓屋營業、星羅棋布、大小新增不下百數十家、大多數無不利市三倍、竟有一年中盈餘十萬元以上者、其餘茶室以及零星食品店、數亦無不劇增、生意亦無不興隆、其中尤以茶室爲最、若某某等大茶室數家、從早至暮、無時不在客滿中、</p>
<p>以上種種僅爲昭昭在人耳目之熒熒大者、餘若不甚需要之絲茶皮毛燃料等業、雖亦頗有盈餘、已不若人注目、更有珠翠之抑價收進、以及舊貨商之來路不明、其投機手段、則更卑劣、不足爲訓、多財善賈、要亦善於利用時機之畸形發展、惟此種種利子之來源、少數出於內地資產階級之供給、其大部份、則爲政府受到之損害、歸納其最大原因、則不出人口劇增、及外滙奇緊之兩事而已、（癸未生）</p>
<h3>證券　戰時公債之消化</h3>
<p>一國之財政、有時因種種特別設備及改進、而感到經常收入經濟力之不足時、以發行公債補充財政上之缺憾爲最合經濟原理、以其取之於民、用之於民、絕無利權外溢之流弊、比之增加稅收、或增發紙幣、爲穩妥而迅速、然發行公債之數量、非可按照國家財政量出爲入之原則誅求無厭、國家之利源如何、人民之財富如何、事前必須經過精密考查、以不妨害人民生計及工商業之發達爲先决條件、在可能範圍內、發行適當數量公債、以補助國家正當財政上之需要、則其消化力、必亦事半功倍、</p>
<p>我國自民元發行公債始、至廿五年整理統一後、連同同時增發之復興公債三萬四千萬元在內、共計不過十八萬萬元、（其中以民國廿年發行公債五種總額四萬萬元爲最鉅）以全國人口比例計算、每一人之擔負、不過四元而已、八一三以後、因戰事上之特別需要、截至廿七年終止、已發行之公債、有下列四種、</p>
<p>（甲）廿六年救國公債五萬萬元</p>
<p>（乙）廿七年金債券、內分（一）海關金一萬萬元、（二）美金五千萬元、（三）英金一千萬鎊、共約合國幣五萬五千萬元、</p>
<p>（丙）廿七年國防公債五萬萬元</p>
<p>（丁）廿七年振濟公債一萬萬元</p>
<p>上列四種公債、其總額爲十六萬五千萬元、在一個財政年度中、發行公債數量、至如此之鉅、當然是驚人的創舉、但加以詳細分皙、則可知爲數仍屬有限、如廿七年之金債券、爲外幣計算、不在內國公債之列、廿六年救國公債、乃人民的熱忱獻金、即民眾自動的救國捐款、政府爲被動的伏爾泰救國公債來接受民眾的自由捐納、故廿七年救國公債到期息票、有大部份持此仍轉獻政府、以表現其救國捐款之初衷、所以上列兩種債券、不得將其全數包括在內國公債發行範圍以內、經此分析後、可知抗戰一年有半以來、其發行的眞正內國公債、不過六萬萬元、連前發行十八萬萬元、共計爲二十四萬萬元、人民負擔數量、亦不過每人六元而已、即連同上兩次債券合計在內、每人負擔之數、仍不過九元、比之日本、七千數百萬人口、一百五十萬萬元公債額、每人有二百元公債負擔、則不過居其二十分之一弱、假定以最低限度估計我們的國力、衹居日本十分之一的話、可知我國民眾、尚有四五十萬萬元公債消化力、民眾對於公債之消化力、與其對於公債之信仰心、有密切關係、欲覘民眾對於公債之信仰心、可於證券市塲公債市價之漲跌測騐得之、茲將八一三以列表於左、</p>
<h3>統一公債停市前後高低比較表及經過原因之大事紀錄</h3>
<p>觀右表，不啻爲民眾對於公債信仰的寒暑計，表內公債市價高漲之重大原因，不外信仰抗戰前途得最後勝利，及英美等國對我國之同情二事而已，憑上兩種信仰基本，則可知民眾對於公債消化力量極强，此種測騐所得，其關係於政治及經濟上之影響尤非常重大也，（九）</p>
<h3>紗花　紗花業　破天茺之盈餘　快哉此時</h3>
<p>二十七年紗花業之興隆發達、可爲有史以來未有之盈利、遠過於歐戰黃金時代、凡屬紗號花號、可說無一家不賺錢、無一人不腰包中麥克麥克、至於紗廠獲利之豐厚、殊可驚人、多在六七百萬元之間、（中略）故有一部份紗廠已將銀行押款淸償、賺回自力管理、不受任何債權節制矣、茲將上年紗花業飛黃騰達之情形曁各方盈利之狀况、簡述如下、</p>
<p>（一）紗價在上半年極萎靡、至秋季因抗戰立塲、始終一貫、人心堅昂、內地人口齊集滬上、潯漢紗廠、拆卸遷蜀、內地需要乃盡集中於滬上矣、</p>
<p>（二）上海方面之紗廠、在日軍侵犯之區域中、泰半爲砲火破壞、不能工作、即能工作、亦由日人經營、所存者僅特區內之華商紗廠、尚能照常工作、但生產之紗綫數量、每日不滿一千包、區區之數、何能應付普遍之需求、調劑不勻、市塲遂呈求過於供狀態、由此一來、四川湘鄂東粵西粵等處受貨物缺乏、市價步步飛騰、故蜀中一包紗、價竟狂漲至一千元以外、</p>
<p>（三）一般殷富者鑒於以上之情况、搜羅囤藏之念、油然而生、交易所各經紀人、空閑一載有餘、靜極思動、於是集資成尋、新創紗花號者、如雨後春筍、且一入市塲、即刻拖進、因此市塲籌碼尤感估涸、市况乃一往直前、新高峯層見迭出矣、</p>
<p>（四）日軍侵襲廣東、漢口又告放棄、華南紗銷主要之區域、頓告喪失、大受打擊、一時猶似激流下注、一瀉千里、直跌至三百十八元、但價格慘落之後、實需漸漸起色、廣州雖陷落、內地唯一交通綫之廣九粵漢運輸綫截斷、然海防至昆明、由達重慶之交通、自努力建築完成後運輸之敏捷、遠非昔比、於此西南需要增進、閩南亦來採辧、兼之我國陣地　固贛省商業恢復繁榮、客幫業集、浙東購辧、轉輾支往後方、而棉布疋頭棉紗尤見暢盛、以　凋敝久　之市面、逐步顯著昭蘇之象、迨至歲暮、因銀行金融寬舒收買益見緊劇、同時南方一隅、消費增加紗價復漲至四百元外、因此紗業一致盈利優厚、據市塲言、紗號最多在五十萬元、、十萬、二十萬元亦有、普通二三萬元爲多數、</p>
<p>（五）再述棉花情况、首先不及紗市之佳、但自入秋季之後、美印棉市雖紛紛下降、然本埠由「日僞」實施統制以後、內地苛捐雜稅、來源梗阻、而長此以來路頭到貨旣枯各鬆懈、漲風反見積極前進、新高價創造不窮、火機花則昂至七十元外、亦係花業之新紀錄、故花號在上半年春夏季中稍有存貨無不大獲利也、花號潤利最大之戶爲七十萬元外、中等在二十三十萬元、亦有好幾家不過爾爾、可稱棉業界發財年、然亦係千載難逢之機會、蹈破鐵鞋無尋處、希望來年再繼續更生也、（源）</p>
<h3>去年現紗成交情形　及其高低價格</h3>
<p>現紗實銷狀况、全年各方面成交總計十九萬零一百四十八包、但其中囤戶及同業之成交量占百分之五十强、至需要最旺者、當然爲西南非戰區域中、戰區以內之紗銷、已爲日紗侵奪殆盡矣、再查去年成交情形、一二月份各方交易爲最少之時期、三月以後隨時局良好而漸漸起色、六月份成交已見增進、九月·十二月丙個月之生意、爲一年中之最盛時期、十月中之成交、因價格超越軌外狂騰、及廣州變色、成交大降、比九月之量、激减百分之八十强、旋即價低、南北戰局順遂、日見增進、至十二月份成交大旺達三萬零三百七十八包、爲本年成交之最夥數量、茲將十二個月成交之多寡、製表分列如左、（單位包）</p>
<p>再將一年以來之最商低價及休假以前之價、比較如下、以資參差、</p>
<h3>從史的方面來談　上海呢絨業</h3>
<p>— 志峯</p>
<p>上海的呢絨業、爲全中國的先驅、當時各省採辧呢絨、要齊向上海購辧、因之上海呢絨業不啻爲全國呢絨業總樞紐、但是在前淸同治年間尚沒有正式經營呢絨店舖、大都由西人來華、隨身帶來備作製衣之用、其後魯意師摩拍賣行、始有少數呢絨運到呌賣、因這時的上海人口與交通建設、商業榮繁、遠不及現在十之九、兼之斯時多通用制錢、生活程度甚低、而呢絨須售銀兩、我國人又不悉呢絨之優點、以爲衹可西洋人作衣着之用、以是所用絕少、至光緒廿八年因爲經過拳匪之役、各地人士到上海者甚眾、且又下詔變法、推行新政、開辧學校、派遣學生出洋、上海租界續放馬路、市面逐漸興旺、歐美西人亦多紛紛來滬開設洋行、邦交敦睦、商賈幅輳、呢絨業在此維新景運之中、油然而見萌芽矣、</p>
<p>民國紀元前二三年、因效法歐西、呢絨遂爲時髦人士所樂用、尤其學界中人士、取其輕柔暖熱、耐穿不縐、婚喪咸宜、男婦老幼、出客常穿、均頗大方、不若綢緞之有富貴氣、同時以穿西裝高尚、洋行小開即有財之留學生、因之銷路擴大、百姓滙路蓬路呢絨店、開設者大增、當民國元年、明令改服制之關係、又爲呢絨開闢獨占之銷塲、同業無一家所賺不盈千盈萬、於是新開及分設者如雨後春筍一般、隨造成虹口區之呢絨市塲、此時可謂爲呢絨業之開創時代也、</p>
<p>上海呢絨商業旣節節發達、西裝人士日增、西服裁縫店林立、大衣生意突繁、花旗兵船生意之利厚、呢絨店與年俱增、但專以西服爲對象、故其生意尚未普通、所賣之貨物、俱係雙幅、不合於製中國服裝之用、於是業中人在棋盤街中、特設一專注重門市、推銷華服衣料、標明每單尺價格、其營業果甚發達、另外則開設批發字號、滿佈於陶朱里·景行里·五福弄·香粉弄·積福里·盆湯衖等處、呢絨銷塲遂奪綢緞之地位而代之、嗶嘰呢絨之長袍、觸目皆是、英美法波德意洋行家、同時亦來滬開行、相率販運現貨出售、斯時華服駱駝絨袍子、風行全滬、雨天則一襲雨衣、寒着、此風流入內地、客幫亦來滬設莊、採辧呢絨、於是呢絨兼中西裝之銷塲而有之、至是同業亦分爲二派、（一）爲虹口拆貨幫、（二）爲上海大路幫是也、</p>
<p>歐洲大戰時、英滙到八九先令、銀樓飾金每兩兌廿四元、虹口拆貨店定貨幫、多有吃虧、一二年內、竟先後倒閉收歇者一半有奇、虹口呢絨市塲幾爲之沒落、及此風潮過去、其有重新開設者、多半遷移於棋盤街、棋盤街呢絨店、因之越聚越眾、雖間有倒閉、然隨閉隨開、店基迄未空虛、大路幫奪門推銷華服衣料外、大多數亦兼營西裝套頭衣料、所異者不出樣板耳、如此每過一年、銷路增大一年、北幫·川幫·粵閩幫·大連幫·採購呢絨相繼擴張、上海呢絨店舖營業之盛、棋盤街呢絨幫勢力超過虹口幫、呢絨同業公會亦由下海遷移至上海、斯時可謂歐戰後之復興時代也</p>
<p>民國十六年、北伐統一、奠都南京、中山裝風行、同時軍政學商各界、穿西裝者特別增夥、着華服者、普通亦以毛製品爲多、城市鄉村、多有大量採辦、掮客跑街突見增多、棋盤街幾成呢絨大市塲、因其店多成市、花色齊全、行情公道、夥友招待、自較拆貨幫爲圓活、便於選擇、互相評價、其時上海一般洋貨店綢緞店、大半亦多經售呢絨、以便顧客之採辦、蓋非如此則生意將受打擊矣、可稱爲呢絨業之鼎盛時代、</p>
<p>棋盤街的呢絨幫、現在可以代表全上海的呢絨大市塲、除需要高等優美呢絨至出樣板之拆貨店去購剪外、普通需要中西衣着料子、莫不駕臨棋盤街去選購、其中除三五家眞不二價外、大半都得還價談判、方可獲得眞實便宜貨、店中常在春秋二季旺銷期中、舉行大减價、一到下午、各店都有不及招待之辛苦、星期日尤甚、廿七年份更加閙忙、足見孤島各路人口集中、消費擴大、亦廿六年中呢絨業所意想不到者也</p>

<h3>接財神</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>接財神的目的，完全是自私；所以有人認為這行為不但迷信得可笑，而且也愚妄得可恥。不過工商界的接財神，却還含有另一種意義；原來一年度的營業，是要從這一天財神日，經過這一種典禮纔開始的。因此各商店行號，對於接財神的典禮是很隆重的，儀式也是很嚴肅的；當廢曆年初四深夜，一方面開列參加禮拜的名單，便决定了人事上的更迭，一方面談談上年度的營業狀况和今後的方針，便宣布了新的目標。為了這，接財神的舉動，至今在工商業界盛行不衰。</p>
<p>據各方的消息，本市各工商業上期總結束的報吿，都各有盈餘。其中以紗業為最佳，有掙賺五六百萬者；匹頭業决之，有凈賺百餘萬者；其他各行各業，十萬五萬不等，比較往年都好看。今天晚上接財神，情緒當然要比以前來得更高興，更熱烈，排塲也必更鋪張，更喧鬧，希望接得財神保佑本行本業，更發皇，更賺錢。不過我們覺得，孤島工商業去年度所以能够有盈餘，却不是財神的賜佑，而是受戰神的恩惠。假使不是戰神將內地的人口驅集此間，將內地的生產破壤無遺，是不會有像今天這樣畸形的反常的繁榮的。正因為如此，所以這繁榮的本質，是十分脆弱，十分虛幻的，而這浮面的景氣，却還包藏着孤島工商業前途的危機。宛如病後之人，身體雖胖，却是虛腫，不是實壯。虛腫的演變是很危險的。</p>
<p>倘然接財神的典禮，果眞是决定新營業方針的時期，那麽希望一般工商業家，別再留戀這空氣惡濁，四周漆黑的孤島，應該計劃投資到內地去，開發我們的無窮盡的富藏。耍明白：將來孤島情形不孤了，現在虛偽的繁榮，便要萎落，何况魔鬼環伺在側，任意攫奪，任意剝削，將是無法逃避的刦運呢！</p>
<h3>楚霸王</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>歷史電影不是史籍的複製，所以稍稍有些出入的改編是可以，有時而且必耍的；但這「可以」或是「必要」，它應該基於新的歷史觀，揚棄地，批判地來運用它，要不然，牛頭不對馬嘴，弄成畫蛇添足，畫虎類犬，那才是個笑話。</p>
<p>所以歷史電影（所謂「古裝片」）的困難，它不僅是在服裝道具的考證以及塲面偉大上，更且是在製作者的觀點上。這之間不會沒有製作者的主觀，因之也决不能模稜二可；編新聞的編輯先生該是最「客觀」的了，但是在標題的大小以及地位的顯著上，却還是無法逃避他的善惡和對某項新聞的意識的反映；作為藝術品的電影，若說是能超然物外，成為「第三種人」，這能成嗎？一</p>
<p>所以對歷史電影的製作，我們基本態度，倒不是如何忠於史實的問題，而是如何以現在的中國人的立塲，來批判接受歷史的敎訓。</p>
<p>「楚覇王」的劇旨，編導者王决龍先生說得很明白：『因為要使故事合乎現代潮流，就以項羽和劉邦兩個人說，一個是主戰窮兵黷武，一個是主和而仁義和平，結果是前者失敗而後者勝利，這是「楚覇王」的劇旨』。</p>
<p>「窮兵黷武」和「仁義和平」，這是針對着現在的中國局勢，也是針對着現在的世界局勢的；「仁者昌，覇者亡」，這原是不易的至理，但在「主戰」「主和」上，我們却還有加以確切的註解的必要，耍不然，「主戰」的岳飛成了千秋的罪人，而「主和」的秦檜，則反而成為萬世的功臣了。際此在精衛之流以出賣祖國為「和平」的藉口，滿嘴「王道」的東方法西斯蒂者主戰不得下台，滿冀求「和」以保贓物的現在，若單單在字面上講什麼「主戰」「主和」，實在有成為侵略者的「尾巴」的危險。想來，本片的製作者的本意，是不會如此的。</p>
<p>所以關於「和」，「戰」，我們實在還應該進一步的來看它。</p>
<p>東方法西斯蒂者在「膺懲」旣吿失敗，「肅淸」又吿絕望之餘，牠在江南所施行的新政策，是懷柔政策，也即是買服人心是也。所謂懷柔政策，拆穿了實在也是不値半分錢的，牠一方面嗾使漢奷，在征暴歛，軟詐硬欺，把糧食等等集攏夾，然後，由牠們出面，把甲地的糧食以一部份運到乙地去「　賑，」儼然是「王者之師」，這樣的鬼把戲，表面上是「仁我和平」之至了，而實際上呢　－－反正很少有人會知道這手鬼把戲的。</p>
<p>而這樣的「仁義和平，」是真的「仁義和平」嗎？</p>
<p>「楚覇王」是以「仁義和平」　勝利，「窮兵黷武」者失敗來作劇旨」的，這原是很好；但所遺憾的也正在這裏，它祇是　了表面，而沒有進一步的來作解剖，而這樣是不够的。</p>
<p>我們同情製作者的苦心，我們更心折這樣嚴正的劇旨，同時却也正因為此時此地，我們更不能不求全責備，以防流并。－－萬一這樣的戲流入到　陷區去公映，那麼這樣的缺陷更應防止。</p>
<p>關於這點，我想舉出一個例子來談談：</p>
<p>「項羽進軍咸陽，不聽衆　，殺秦王子嬰，戮咸陽百姓數萬人」後，銀幕上是有民婦謀進項帳，刺殺覇王一塲戲的，這塲戲很重要，那個民婦的話更値得我們注意。她說：「百姓們推倒秦王以後，所希望的是仁義和平之師，那知道覇王一至咸陽，便殺百姓無數，……所以被殺者的家屬，便結為同盟，打成刺刀，由她進帳來謀行刺，以巷被殺戳的百姓們復仇。……（大意如此）這一塲戲，以「劇旨」講，是也確乎合「劇旨」的，並目顯示民衆的不可輕侮，然而，在我們看來，則覺得這樣的「劇旨」，却還有加以明確的指示的必要，第一，我們應該正確顯明的指示出民衆的敵人是誰？第二，我們必須把敵人固定起來，這樣，才不致把在暴殘酷的敵人，悮認為仁義和平之師，而寄以愛撫的希望，在這種地方，我們唯有以今日的中國人的立塲，來强調「劇旨，」來警吿動搖苟且的落後的民衆；若這樣的主題不把它明地表現出來，則可能地會招致許多恨會的</p>
<p>可遺憾的是「楚覇王」沒有顯明的百分之百的把它做到。</p>
<p>其他的，在劇本編製上，也正是在導演的處理上，似乎因為太着重于幾塲重頭戲，把過塲戲忽略了，以致使人有似看京戲的「全部楚漢相爭」之類，形成為一齣一齣老戲的連續的感覺，這固然是史料太多，不易處置，但也是因為劇作者太着重于覇王的匹夫之勇的結果，歷史不是個人造成的，太强調了個人，而忽略了他的環境和演變，那也是一件危險的事情。</p>
<p>這個，也許是劇作者受了平劇的影響，（攝古裝片的困難，如何跳出平劇的影響，也正是其一）所以在分塲上，不自覺的造成如此，而在對白的編寫上，演員的動作和念白上，也是如此。</p>
<p>王元龍的覇王，在粗暴上是有他的可取之處的，但力拔山兮的氣概則還不够，特別是馬上英姿，因為體格的不够，更不足狀這位一世之雄的覇王：金素琴的虞姬，戲不多，也許更因為是初上鏡頭，所以也並不驚人，其他幾位，在氣質上，似也有可商榷的地方。</p>
<p>這個戲最可取之點，是塲面的偉大，從這一點上來看，可見是不惜工本的，但因爲敵我的不够寫得分明，所以雖化費甚大，我們總還不能覺得十分滿意。</p>
<p>攝古裝片有其特殊便利的地方，那是在乎喻古惕今，而這點，以此時此地的中國人來看，在「楚覇王」中，是不够使人過癮的。</p>
<h3>喜訊</h3>
<p>— 墨典</p>
<p>接到你的來信，已在大除夕晚上了。上海的古歷新年是比國曆新年來得繁忙的，被稱了「孤島」後並沒有兩樣；或許更甚焉。據報上記載，各業總結賬，都是大盈餘，你也可想闊別二年的上海的繁榮狀態了。但是故人如舊，筆耕所入，是不足以養家的，大除夕晚上，依然是被信務窘迫着，漫無頭緒的四出奔波，而且，幾乎坐「香港車」去兜喜神方，到巡捕房去「守歲」。</p>
<p>這自然是僅僅屬我個人的事，是無關於大除夕的。</p>
<p>南京路上的店舖，都延長營業時間，糖菓部的擁擠情形，呌人駭而却步；八點剛敲過，電形院門前已高懸着「客滿」之牌了；跳舞塲裏自然是盛况空前；街頭佇立着人羣，我奇怪，他們在看什麽呢？</p>
<p>回到家裹，四面都是牌聲，這似乎是一過年」應有的點綴。</p>
<p>恕我免俗，或許是窮，有得舒一口氣的機會，就倒在床上睡了；這一點，和你比起來是還算幸福的。</p>
<p>大年初一醒來，最先的聲音送進我的耳朵的，依然是牌聲，我不知他們打了個通宵，還是像電影院一樣特放早塲的？總之，這種精神殊令人欽佩！</p>
<p>天公却是不作美，下起雨來了。我木來可以休息一天，但隔晚和一個朋友的定，還有點未了事宜要乘早交代淸楚。家裏也沒有預備得圓子，蓮子，所以像平時一樣，空着肚子出鬥</p>
<p>在厨房裏碰見二房東太太，她在點香燭，拜菩薩，見了我，堆着終年難見的笑容，向我道恭喜，並問我望親戚去嗎？我不知怎樣回答她的，大概祇是頷首為禮而已。終年倒霉，如果今年眞有喜訊高照的話，就是她的難見的笑容了。</p>
<p>在朋友家裹吃了午飯，朋友的妻要去看電影，邀我一同去。因為是熟朋友，他們請客也不是今日始，老實地跟着走了。可是說也奇怪，連跑了兩個電影院都是「客滿」，而且五時半的票子也沒有，要在下午二點鐘時候，就預計看九點鐘的電影，這種好整以暇的性情我們是沒有的。天又下着雨，向朋友吿辭而別。</p>
<p>難得有一天休息的機會，却又覺得太空　了。回家去嗎？冷冰冰地也太辜負這大年初一了；那末，我在雨中躑躅着，像幽魂似的，打不定主意了。</p>
<p>本來，在上海雖沒有親戚，朋友還多，不過人家不會像我這樣閒散的，有家的人總得向各處走走，即使能百中選一，免强找一個同病相憐的朋友，然在大年初一，就去雨齋撩天，在人情上也是說不過去的。也虧我忽發奇想，買了一份報，在一家新開幕的電影院穿堂裏坐定了。那裏有水汀設備，頗舒適的沙發，燃了一支捲烟，彷彿等候情人那樣地看看報，看看呆片，……到五時半的電影開塲才溜了出來，因為那個穿皇家制服的僕歐，似乎有點注意我的樣子了。</p>
<p>這時候街燈巳亮了，街頭却是十分寗寂的我在愛多亞路上找到一家小館子，居然照常營業，就挨進去和那些戴歪帽子的「朋友」坐在一起，要一點酒，大嚼一頓，回家又往床上一倒</p>
<p>這個新年是怎樣過的，已赤裸裸的吿訴你了，雖然我還沒有描寫我的心境怎樣，不過老朋友總不難從字里行間去猜測的。</p>
<p>今天我照常工作了，反覺得遍體舒泰，大概生就的窮相！不過，我覺得做人確是要「做「的，像你，總不會把這幾天白白地放走的，而且，在你們這一羣裏，不但把手頭的事「做」，更拚命地找事來「做」呢。</p>
<p>如果今年眞有喜訊的話，那末一定從你那裏傳來的。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第四回　溯往事樂天傳妙語　締新交勝地作淸游</p>
<p>第二件國內新聞，也很為別緻。却是中國與蘇聯訂了一個貿易條件每年以中國五千萬元的茶葉，掉換蘇聯同價値的煤油。這個「以物易物」的方法，在初民時代是流行的。就是所謂以其所有易其所無，當初始行於個人間。譬如你有了布，我有了米，我就把米來換你的布。反之，你要別樣的東西，也可以和人交換，那就是貿易的起點。不想到如今，國際間也盛行起這個以物易物的制度來。因為中國近來也有幾個煤油礦是開採了，實在需用浩繁，單靠自已國內所出產的煤油，是萬萬不够用的。照現在的情形，十成之三，是用自己國內所產的煤油，十成之四是用美國的煤油，尙差十成之三，就非得用蘇聯出產的煤油了。好在中國的茶葉，銷到蘇聯去的也是大宗，因此便訂了這一個交換條件。聽到了這一條新聞時別人不打緊，何家兩位小姐，却注意了。他們想；這是父親到了北平以後，方始開表的·父親在上海的時候，已經接頭過的了，那也是她們父親北行後許多事件中的一件。這時儷玉向雙玉看看，雙玉也點了點頭，大家會意，也不便說出來。除了這兩件國內新聞，比較重要外，其餘便很瑣屑了。國內新聞報吿以後，叉報吿國際新聞。國際新聞重要的是决定明年一月十日，開第三决軍縮會議。軍縮會議不是鬧了二三十年嗎？從前橫也一個軍縮會議，豎也一個軍縮會議，今年也開軍縮會議，明年也開軍縮會議。開來開去，結果，軍縮會議，變成了軍擴會議。這一决，却是眞正的軍縮會議了。各國吃了齊心酒，大家說開了，有什麼過不去呢？因此在明年一千九百五十二年一月十日，在美國華盛頓，開第三决軍縮會議。第一件事，無論那一國，不許再製造轟炸飛機。以前的軍用飛機，一律都改為民用，不能改為民用的，概行燬去。還有那種製造毒氣彈的人，無論你怎樣的化學博士，或是發明家。倘然自此以後冉要製出那種殘害人類的毒氣來，便公認為世界的罪人，無論到伺國，都可以拘禁他起米。（四三）</p>

<h3>新艷秋爲國犧牲</h3>
<p>— 慕雲</p>
<p>路透社二十日北平電　接可恃華人消息，女伶新艷秋（譯音）女士，數星期前在吉祥戲院圓刺繆斌未果，而關徵林（譯音）則當場殞命，未幾新艷秋卽遭日憲兵逮捕，頃已瘐死獄中。</p>
<p>新艷秋，姓王，名玉華，北平人。其父王海山，人甚長厚，兄子祥，嘗從徐蘭元習胡索，及成乃爲妹操琴，玉華姓聰慧，貌亦秀美，眉目間有英爽氣，故飾爲「紅拂」「虞姬」等最見精彩。武生泰斗楊小樓平生不甚與女伶合演，惟「霸王別姬」一劇，獨以玉華配虞姬，足微其藝術之超越矣。玉華唱宗程艷秋，貌亦幾分似程，爰取名新艷秋焉。後復從名旦王瑤卿學劇，造詣益深，十年前同時有三坤伶自平來滬出演。一爲大舞台之雪艷琴，二爲天蟾之劉艷琴，三即丹桂第一台之新艷秋也。三艷爭雄，色藝均有足取，較之寰昔重色不重藝時之一輩坤伶皆高出多多矣。三人中雪艷琴以嗓勝，新艷秋以腔勝，而劉艷琴則以刀馬武工見長也。不數年間雪則爲溥儀之從見納爲　室，劉則於離滬後，失其下落，獨新艷秋則於返平後仍不時出演。言菊朋，王又宸等且均先後爲其跨刀（即掛二牌之老生也）故聲譽鵲起，儼然被推爲坤旦中之首席焉。四五年前忽爲中央軍某少年師長所眷戀，嘗以數千金爲購一新汽車，時時馳騁於前外各鬧市間。舊京伶人之有自備汽車者除連良，小雲，叔岩，數人外。餘如程硯秋等均係以包車代步。故玉華之有汽車頗爲同行所驚異，一時謠言　起，咸謂其將謝絕　毺生活，而與某師長諧白首焉。旋聞其家庭中條件甚苛，有非十萬番佛不肯許嫁之說，因之事又中止。此次報載玉華在東城吉祥園謀刺繆斌未果，竟爲日憲兵捕去，瘐死獄中。據一般人推測，玉華旣與中央某少年師長感情甚篤，且日夕受其熏陶，愛國之心，自亦不肯後人，日覩繆等喪心病狂，甘心認賊作父，或觸其義烈之念，願倣紅拂等俠女之所爲，故作驚人之舉，偕爲伶界中放一異彩，否則或以嫌疑入獄，遂致香消玉殞。至其確實原因，衹好待諸將來之調查云。（上刊乃其四年所攝「別姬」劇照）</p>
<h3>羅賓漢考</h3>
<p>— 家鳳</p>
<p>英勇的羅賓漢是射箭的無敵大將軍，擊劍的能手，很浪漫，快樂而和霭可親。他在現代，像在司各脫爵士，歐文幾世紀以前一樣，是一個著名和活躍的人物。事實上現在他並且更比以前更加紅得發紫了，因爲范朋克和佛林恩兩個名角已經把這個活躍和可愛的人物攝成了影片。</p>
<p>但是世界上眞有這個勇敢的戰士嗎？有些會很詫異的，向我們提出這樣一個問題來。自然事實上這個可愛的大盜，除了在歌謠中和故事書裏以外，的確在正史上是無法找到他的事跡的。</p>
<p>首先提到羅賓漢的，一三七七年出版威廉郎蘭的詩集。接着尉湯的蘇格蘭史也提到了他。從此以後，關於這個勇敢的綠林好漢和他的部下的傳說及軼事，就愈傳愈多。愈傳愈復雜。在司各脫著的撒克遜劫後英雄各裏面，羅賓漢是書中的主人翁，他先以拉弓的迭更和射箭的洛克司雷兩個名字出現，最後，他還用他的老名字羅賓漢和世人相見。</p>
<p>有些歷史家和小說家雖然知道尚須要歷史的資料來加以證實，總覺得羅賓漢是眞有其人似的。</p>
<p>人家以爲羅賓漢是當獅心的理查皇時代，在英格蘭的希烏特查林內出現的。這是當地薩克遜人受繼任威廉皇的諾曼底的勝利者的壓迫時代。他們在一零六六年征服這個國家。</p>
<p>依照早年流傳下來的故事，說到這個暴徒的事業，羅賓漢是搶富濟貧的。起初人家假定他是窮苦人家出身，但是這個故事一年一年的流傳下去，一般人覺得他實在太好了，所以人講故事的人就說他是出身貴族。最近在華納兄弟公司的影片中，他的眞名字呌「洛克司雷伯爵」</p>
<p>關於好萊塢怎樣取捨羅賓漢的傳說這件事是很有趣的。范朋克爲他的出品，在一張紙上寫了四十四個字的一個綱要。華納兄弟公司的研究部對於這很做了一番研究的工作。研究部研究了四五年關於這個人物的記載。佛林恩的劇本作者萊恩和密萊讀了一切流行的關於羅賓漢的材料，然後把他們的筆記扔了，做了一個故事　，恰巧和范朋克所做的一樣。</p>
<h3>蒨蒨室劇話談蕭太後一角</h3>
<p>— 肖傖</p>
<p>陳德霖爲民國以後之靑衣泰斗，其唱但守舊法，不務新奇，而台下聽者，羣稱其妙，不厭其舊，此乃由於嗓音唱法，皆有眞實力量，眞實工夫，故能於靑衣新腔競爭時代，巍然獨存，近鄭過宜先生在新聞報談雁門關，力繩王瑤卿在該劇中飾蕩蕭太後之聲容並茂，瑤卿念白之老辣乾脆，不同凡響，其神情氣度，亦自成一格，雍容大方，爲俗伶所勿逮，愚於德霖瑤卿兩伶之唱做，俱許爲菊部奇才，惟過宜先生未能一見德霖之蕭太後，茲以本報黃寄萍先生一再索稿，特草此文，以示同好。</p>
<p>陳德霖探母回令之蕭太後一角，在舊都幾成爲彼一人之專職，凡盛大堂會中，大軸又往往排探母一劇，故久寓北京者，無不知德霖蕭太後之獨步歌壇，其道白之佳，固不待言，而其舉止容儀之華貴端肅，尤擅勝塲，蓋其供奉內廷，於八旗貴族婦人之度態舉止，揣摩極有心得，故能恰合身分斯豈等閒所能窺效耶。</p>
<p>王瑤卿在民國十年以前，絕不飾蕭太後一角，良以珠玉在前，不欲與德霖爭一日之長，瑤卿之念白，乾脆老辣固其所長，而發音未脫角音，亦爲其唯一弱點，德霖京自之淸脆勁聽，而能宛然逼肖旗婦之聲，遂超居瑤卿之上，比德霖在探母回令中之快板，爲靑衣第一，以其口風淸脆，嗓音圓轉，愈唱得快，愈顯仕妙，與老譚之快板，異曲同工，德霖具此兩優點，遂非瑤卿所得並肩，况德霖之氣度神態，亦駕乎瑤卿之上，故談蕭太後，必以陳德霖爲絕唱，又探母回令中太後與公主對白一段，針孔相對，一氣呵成，略一遲緩，便失精採，德霖之受人稱賞，於此處亦大顯身手，德霖瑤卿之後，當代推許吳彩霞與落芙蓉草兩人，彩霞純守舊法，桐珊則一以德霖爲法，海上無不稱譽桐珊探母太後之佳，實則桐珊太後之旗裝台步法，猶露矜持跡象，做作氣尚未脫盡，以視德霖台步之純任自然，眞有上下牀之分，此非敢以德霖已逝，故作此論，以驚世俗，實以兩人之藝，作平心之論，想爲常聆德霖之蕭太後者，許爲公言也。</p>
<p>愚於民國三年冬，舊都伶聯會義務戲，在天樂聆及陳德霖　雲甫王瑤卿路三寶胡素仙賈洪林金仲仁王蕙芳等角之雁門關，（南北和一折）德霖之太後，老　佘太君，兩人工力悉敵，洵可稱爲此曲天上矣，其後在新明大戲院梅蘭芳排整本雁門關，乃以德霖雲甫王鳳卿朱素雲錢金福王長林荀慧生朱桂芳李壽山姜妙香諸伶爲配，亦極盛一時，愚未窺全豹，僅去聽一天，至今猶引爲憾事也。</p>
<h3>廢歷新年中海上平劇戲院巡禮</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>海上平劇戲院自去冬封箱後，整頓內部及增减角色，均已籌劃完備，一律於已卯元旦開鑼復業，點綴年景，記者曾在各院後台探訪，茲將所見盛况分述如後：</p>
<p>黃金　北派坤旦祭酒章遏雲，其色藝久爲滬上人士所傾仰，此番出演，由楊寶森，葉盛蘭，劉連榮，馬富祿輩爲之輔，益收花紅葉綠之妙，顧曲界醉心遏雲者，趨之若驚，故連日客滿，成績彌優。</p>
<p>卡爾登　移風劇社原定於封箱期內排練二本文索臣，劇以爲時短促而未果，開鑼以來，預定演唱舊劇半月，再行排演新戲，戲迷對該社有深刻信仰，除夕前紛紛定座，業將元旦至財神日之全部座票，預售一空，周信芳誠可謂「平劇界之權威者」矣。</p>
<p>共舞台　該台排演紅連寺一劇，已深卽入觀眾之腦海，號召力極爲强大，元旦夜即開演二十九本新戲，自武生袁小樓，黃寶岩及童伶筱小神童加入，陣容尤爲鞏固，故是晨九時，即有觀眾購票入座，至十一時半已緊拉鐵門，被摒於外，何止數百，猶有竚候至日塲完畢始獲入內者，其盛况實爲各院之冠，該台門前以火燒紅連寺全景爲裝飾，頗令人注目，亦吸引觀眾之絕妙工具也。</p>

<h3>藝人趣味</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>在電影界裏提起「美髯公」這個名字，大家就會想到滿臉於思的高梨痕：據說他所以要在漂亮的面龐上裝上這一業十分討厭的東西，是有一個原因的，而且這原因的內幕又是一種不可告人的隱秘！他是四川人，帶有四川腔的上海方言便鬧成了許多笑話，於是一般女明星往往誤會他的說話而跟他吵嘴起來！他愛吃辣味，家中常年必備的小菜便是一甕辣菜！</p>
<p>專門飾演「王先生」的就是湯傑，表演的藝術是勝過他的導演手法，這也就是說，他在導演方面是不及在表演方面容易獲到成功的！若干年前，他有愛看漫畫癖，報上雜誌上，凡是刊有漫畫的東西，他都要看個明白，方才心死。但是他最欽佩的却是葉淺予盡的「王先生」，他覺得「王先生」的舉動行事，不僅十分有趣，而且又暴露了各層社會的病態。所以當他服務於天一公司的時候，他便介紹「王先生」給邵醉翁，提議攝製；同時他還主張由自己來担任「王先生」這一角。結果，他的提議成爲事實，因此便在開拍的前夕爲求逼眞，他不惜把滿頭黑髪薙去，甚至忍痛拔去兩隻美觀的門牙。</p>
<p>有「第二胡蝶」之稱的貂斑華，原是文逸民斑的强華公司裏的一個不重要的演員。然而，女人以美幸賣錢，脫離强華之後的貂斑華，終於一帆風順，也變成一個紅明星了。她有小孩子的天眞脾氣，因爲天眞，對於一切就也視爲兒戲。例如戀愛；她是沒有認識的，她覺得人人可愛，可是她却無法辨別對象所以可愛的地方，於是一而再，再而三，接連着鬧出了許多笑話；而且笑話影響了她的前途！</p>

<h3>孤島劇話</h3>
<p>— 王唯我</p>
<p>我談麒派</p>
<p>談麒派不是一件容易的事，倒非對於這一門，有深刻硏究不能下筆，以前思君的「麒派」一文，未免有些不能使人同情的地方，現在姑且捨麒派主人的周信芳不說，講到目前學麒派的人，雖然以高百歲的地位和聲譽最好，可是以實際論，將來繼傳信芳衣缽的的人，當非王椿柏莫屬。</p>
<p>王椿柏原名王雲森，是武英雄（即戲班所謂打下靶的）出身，嘗在新新公司屋頂花園掛頭牌，入共舞臺後，易今名，有一登龍門，身價百倍之概。椿柏學麒，頗費心血，唱做皆恰到好處，允以武工有相當基礎，此爲百歲　峯諸人所不及。信芳早年爲武工武生，信芳所演諸戲，間接而言，非武工有相當根底，不能討好，故信芳亦嘗下絕對斷語，相信王樁柏必爲學麒最有成就之一人。</p>
<p>至於百歲，其藝遠駕椿柏之上，惟學麒則不如椿柏之對工，百歲原宗劉鴻聲，半路出家，拜了周信芳，其實，以百歲那樣一條好嗓子，學麒眞糟塌了。百歲武工，亦有根底，但身上則並不美觀，允以　步之常走斜步，難看到極點，唱唸嘴裏爲麒派中最佳之一人，做工則涉於呆板，不如陳鶴峯之靈活。陳鶴峯早年以靈活過度，近於油滑，近年來鶴峯頗能去蕪存菁，乃不如以往之油滑，而反多可取，允以身上之漂亮，與水袖跳袍之工夫，極能　邊式美觀之能事，其藝確是進步不少。</p>
<p>以上三人外，信芳之及門弟子，尙有已故之王瀛洲，及楊寳童二人，（于宗瑛王少樓王富英難皆列入信芳門牆但亦本工武生故棄之不論）王瀛洲之嗓，最效信芳，做則過火，但其藝實較楊寳童爲佳，楊寳童之學麒，可謂一無可取，惟其人好學不倦，「有志者事竟成」，將來當有進展也。</p>
<p>陳筱穆，李非春，徐鴻培等，亦皆挑麒派幌子，（思君所謂之鄭元嶙，朱均培，則未嘗聞爲麒派老生）陳李之藝，不登大雅，徐鴻培近得范叔年之敎導，有蒸蒸向上之慨，後生可畏也。</p>
<p>講到票界，學麒派者，近年來，多如過江之鯽，以前當以郭翛翛爲最佳，郭退隱後，信芳之快婿張中原，可稱此中魁首。學信芳之「追韓信」，允推孫蘭亭第一；唱幾句，汪其俊最動聽，資格最老經騐最富者，爲朱聯馥；餘如王雪塵華震亞，亦皆麒派之信徒。思君所謂之程毓章，爲周信芳之大弟子，原非票友，且毓章亦非老生底子，這些是我的意見質之思君，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>希特勒的愛人猶太女明星</h3>
<p>— 皓</p>
<p>誰都以爲這一語驚天下的德元首希特勒至今。其實，天曉得，他早已有情人了，這也不奇，奇的是他的情人，還正是他最痛恨的猶太人！這眞令人莫名其妙，豈是英雄氣短兒女情長耶。</p>
<p>提起這位猶太女子，原來是銀幕上的紅星，芳名呌蘭訥黎芬詩德LaneRefenster現在芳齡二十一，她在十四歲時，就成了無父母的孤兒。由她的舅父帶她到聖康司城裏的一個歌舞戲院裏去學習舞蹈。因爲她天生麗質，聰明活潑，所以不到三個年頭，已很有名了，就變了一個大衆的安琪兒，最後她得到友人的帮助，進了奧地利亞的菲納斯影片公司，於是她又是一個銀幕上的明星了。</p>
<p>她進了影片公司以後，演的片干都是音樂片或歌舞片，並且演的很少。直到前年的夏天，影片公司裏的一個頂紅的女明星患肺病而死了，於是她的命運轉佳了，就像雨過天靑的透了起來。</p>
<p>去年蘭訥到德國去找一位著名的音樂家，這位音樂家却是希特勒的摯友。蘭訥和希特勒就由這位「月下老人」介紹而熟識了</p>
<p>當希特勒一見這當世允物蘭訥的時候，他的鐵錚錚的心，竟大爲搖動，使這位元首，把一些排猶的思想，幾乎拋到九霄雲外，於是二個勢不兩立的人竟熱戀起來了。</p>
<p>但起初，希特勒並不知道這紅星是猶太人。當他們的戀情，正如火如荼的時候，蘭訥便很勇敢地對希特勒說：「我是猶太女人呀！你竟愛我嗎？」希特勒聽了非但不忿怒，反擁抱着蘭訥吻着說：「沒有什麼關係的，只要我愛你就是了，」說完，又是甜密的一吻……</p>
<p>這段香艷的事被德國陸軍總長戈林聽到了以後，即忠吿希特勒，但是希特勒竟對戈林說：「請你不要干涉我的私生活，」戈林聽到這樣一句話，就氣憤地走了。</p>
<p>是的，這該是怎樣神秘的事呢！蘭訥很知道自己處境的危險，但只有小心地把柔軟的情絲繞住了這當世硬漢—希特勒。</p>
<h3>關於劇本的題材和編製</h3>
<p>— 孝蘭</p>
<p>誰都知道劇作者的使命，在乎找好的題材，寫成一部好的劇本，供給扮演的人們，題材的產生，是根據劇作者超特的理智，認淸社會上許多人們不經意的大問題。運用他聰敏的頭腦，安排好眞切的和假想的事實，憑他靈活的筆尖，寫成劇本，表示題材的重要性，甚或聰敏的劇作者，穿揷自己的批判劇本裏，作爲本題的解决方式，這樣劇作者，不單使觀衆認識了這問題的嚴重，更給予觀衆解决這問題的帮助。要是劇作者，對於社會沒有豐富的經歷，深切的認識，那還是把題材忠誠地寫出，不加一些自我的批判，讓觀衆認識了這素來不經意的問題，自己去解答爲妙。</p>
<p>劇作者如已找到了好的題材，着手編製之先，要抓住題材的重心，如果這題材的重心，憑着編製的技巧，能够在一幕中顯示無遺的，那就可以知道這是獨幕劇的題村。本來編製劇本，並不在幕數的多寡，分幕劇的編製，除了表演本題材重心的主幕，其他各慕，在襯托和加强主幕的重要性外，亦須抓住各分幕的重心，在演出上就不致散漫，平淡；又須斟酌到各分幕所含蓄的情緒，不使其緊張熱烈的程度，超過主幕的演出，有喧賓奪主的弊病，反使觀衆模糊認識的本能，這一點，劇作者於編製時亟宜加以注意的。</p>

<p>伶人對於吃喝嫖賭及玩弄鳥獸蟲魚等的嗜好</p>

<p>少山有一次同梅博士到香港唱戲，曾花了六百塊錢買了一隻小老虎，這個虎的頭上有個很淸楚的王字，又因他自已是屬虎的，所以他情願出了很大的代價買了牠來，預備帶回上海，在他寓中可以開一個虎·猴·貓·狗·的動物博覽會了。不料想這隻虎兒太小，當他在船上的時候，把一大塊生牛肉給牠吃，牠因爲沒有很大的咀嚼力，呑又呑不下，吐又吐不出，這樣一來，活活的就卡死了。他道種揮霍無度同他那愛養牲畜的性兒，在梨園行裏的確算是罕見而很可怪的。</p>

        <h1>1939.02.22</h1>
<h3>The National Political Council Unanimously Resolved to Wholeheartedly Support the Government in Implementing the Second Phase of the War of Resistance National Policy, Insisting on Supporting the Established War of Resistance Policy to the End, and the Great Righteousness Demonstrated in Chairman Chiang's Declaration. The Government Should Order the Military and Civilians Nationwide to Unanimously Obey. After Nine Consecutive Meetings, More Than Eighty Proposals Were Passed. The Congress Closed Yesterday.</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council held its sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth (final) meetings on the afternoon of the 19th, the morning and afternoon of the 20th, and the morning of the 21st. All councilors in Chongqing and all senior officials attended. Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and Recording Secretaries Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu, among others, were present. Because all the proposals had been discussed extensively, the atmosphere remained extremely enthusiastic. The following is a record of the proposals that were passed:</p>
<p>Proposal to Support the National Policy of Resistance</p>
<p>During the sixth meeting held on the 19th, the following three proposals were discussed together: (1) Councilor Chu Fucheng and 23 others proposed that the Council should solemnly declare and reiterate its support for the national policy of resistance at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. (2) Councilor Wang Zhuoran and 24 others proposed to firmly support Chairman Chiang's rejection of the Konoe Statement. (3) Councilor Lin Zuhan and 20 others proposed to support Chairman Chiang's stern condemnation of the Konoe statement and to take it as the sole standard for the national policy of resistance in the future. After discussion, when put to a vote, all councilors present stood up and passed the resolution. The resolution was solemn and moving. The full text of the resolution is as follows: The resolution to support the "Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction" passed by this Council at its first session and the "National Policy for Maintaining Prolonged Resistance" passed at its second session were powerful expressions of national will and unity, and it was already well known at home and abroad that we must be determined to abide by them together. On December 22nd of last year, the former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe issued a statement in an attempt to realize his ambition to dominate all of China and monopolize East Asia. Chairman Chiang, with his insight into his treacherousness, issued a declaration on December 26th of the same month, refuting the statement and demonstrating the determination of our government and people to maintain the established national policy. The declaration was righteous and firm, and the whole country admired it. When the members of this Council were scattered in various places at that time, they were greatly inspired after hearing this wise and great declaration. At this meeting, Councilor Chu Fucheng and 23 others proposed that the Council should solemnly express and reiterate its support for the national policy of resistance. Councilor Wang Zhuoran and 20 others and Councilor Lin Zuhan and 20 others proposed to support Chairman Chiang's declaration refuting the Konoe statement. The purposes of these proposals are the same. After joint discussion, it is now solemnly resolved that the established policy of resistance must be supported to the end. Our nation should wholeheartedly support the government in implementing the second phase of the national policy of resistance. Our government should order the military and civilians nationwide to obey the great righteousness declared by Chairman Chiang in his declaration of December 26th of last year, strengthen their confidence, unify their steps, and be of one heart and one mind from beginning to end, so as to restore the integrity of our territory, sovereignty, and administration, and complete the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Internal Affairs</p>
<p>(1) Councilor Zhang Yuanfu and 21 others proposed that in order to promote the effectiveness of administration, attention should be paid to administrative coordination. (2) Councilor Luo Heng and 22 others proposed that a national population census should be conducted and a "Residence Permit" and "Production Permit" system should be implemented to thoroughly rectify national security and benefit the long-term war of resistance. (3) Councilor Fu Sinian and 53 others proposed that the government should formulate a "Civil Servant Recusal Law". (4) Councilor Qian Gonglai and 20 others proposed that in order to overcome the theocratic superstition and fatalistic propaganda of the masses with low cultural standards in the rear, wartime education and cultural decrees should be implemented. (5) Councilor Yang Ziyi and 23 others proposed that the government should promptly issue measures for evacuating the population in order to provide relief. The review opinion was that the principle was approved and the government was requested to properly plan and implement it effectively. (6) Councilor Luo Wengan and 20 others proposed that the government should implement the selection of the virtuous and capable to purify officialdom, etc. (7) Councilor Wang Baozhen and 37 others proposed to provide relief to Hebei refugees and unemployed and out-of-school youth. (8) Councilor Wang Baozhen and 32 others proposed to organize a large-scale border service corps to investigate border conditions, unite border residents, develop border areas, and increase the strength of the war of resistance. (9) Councilor Li Yuanding and 24 others proposed that the government should carefully select county magistrates, improve their treatment, determine their tenure, and strictly supervise them in order to improve county administration and benefit the war of resistance and national reconstruction. (10) Councilor Zhang Junli and 23 others proposed that a large sum of money should be allocated quickly to relieve the flood-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu. (11) Councilor Dong Biwu and 26 others proposed to strengthen the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and promote the spirit of the people to benefit the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Economic and Financial Affairs</p>
<p>(1) Councilor Zhang Jianming and 32 others proposed four suggestions for actively promoting the construction of the southwest, and requested the government to adopt and implement them. (2) Councilor Zou Taofen and 20 others proposed to abolish the increase in postage for books and printed matter in order to popularize education and increase the strength of the war of resistance. (3) Councilor Xirao Jiacuo and 22 others proposed to pay attention to the issue of commodity prices and food in the rear to prevent crises. (4) Councilor Gao Xibing and 21 others proposed to merge all agencies into economic construction agencies in order to centralize the research information from all parties and formulate a design for the entire national economic construction during and after the war. (5) Councilor Li Zhongxiang and 22 others proposed to regulate food in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and consolidate the foundation of the war of resistance. (6) Councilor Wang Shiying and 19 others proposed to improve the economic institutions in the war zones in order to enrich the strength of the all-out war of resistance. (7) Councilor Chen Xihhao and 26 others proposed to establish an economic policy in the war zones to benefit the war of resistance and maintain people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Education and Culture</p>
<p>(1) Councilor Gao Xibing and 22 others proposed to compile a history of the war of resistance as soon as possible in order to value wartime literature. (2) Councilor Zhang Yi and 21 others proposed to put the opinions on the format of compiling war history to a public vote. (3) Councilor Liu Xinqing and 22 others proposed that the central government's funding for compulsory education should be doubled year by year according to the original plan in order to promote compulsory education in the war zones and rear provinces. (4) Councilor Liu Hengjing and 22 others proposed that the central government should increase funding for general education and culture when compiling the next fiscal year's national budget in order to actively promote national education. (5) Councilor Hu Shiqing and 27 others proposed that the government should increase special funding to maintain and expand special education in order to exert the effectiveness of education and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. (6) Councilor Chen Shi and 21 others proposed to urgently rescue youth in the occupied areas to prevent them from being used by the enemy. (7) Councilor Huang Jianzhong and 21 others proposed that senior high schools should be divided into arts and science departments, and the arts department should be divided into two groups, A and B, in order to improve the level of students. (8) Councilor Wang Zaoshi and 19 others proposed to establish comprehensive cultural work to adapt to the second phase of the all-out war of resistance policy. When this proposal was presented, Councilor Wang Zaoshi stood up and spoke, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the concentration of newspapers and publications in the rear and large cities, and the lack of cultural food in the front. Councilor Huang Yanpei also said that there are currently 14 newspapers in Chongqing, and 80% of their content is completely the same, and it is too uneconomical to concentrate publishing in one place. (9) Councilor Wang Liming and 22 others proposed to eliminate traitorous texts and strengthen the people's belief in the victory of the war of resistance. Councilor Chen Shouming and 23 others proposed that the central government should widely print various foreign propaganda materials to facilitate overseas propaganda.</p>
<p>At the eighth meeting held by the third session of resident councilors on the 20th, the list of elected members of the third session of resident councilors was recorded as follows: Kong Geng, Xirao Jiacuo, Zhang Junli, Li Zhongxiang, Lu Qian, Huang Yanpei, Xu Xiaoyan, Tao Baichuan, Ma Liang, Fan Yushui, Zuo Shunsheng, Wang Jiazhen, Deng Feihuang, Zhang Lan, Liu Hengjing, Liu Xumo, Wang Shiying, Hu Shiqing, Dong Biwu, Li Huang, Jiang Yong, Fu Sinian, Shen Junru, Xu De, Qin Bangxian. Councilor Zhou Binglin was originally elected as a resident councilor, but because he had assumed the position of Deputy Secretary-General, he resigned from the position of resident councilor to the Speaker, who approved it. Councilor Qin Bangxian was elected to fill the vacancy. (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>The Congress Held a Closing Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council, which opened on the 12th, held nine plenary sessions, passed more than eighty resolutions, and achieved good progress and satisfactory results. After the ninth session at 10:00 AM on the 21st, a closing ceremony was held. President Kong of the Executive Yuan, Vice President Zhang Qun, Central Committee members Ye Chucang and Wu Tiecheng, and councilors Zhong Rongguang and Hu Yuan, among others, totaling 133 people, attended. Speaker Chiang led the attendees in performing the ceremony as usual, and then delivered a closing speech. After the speech, the audience applauded warmly. Next, Vice Speaker Zhang and Councilor Zhang Yi delivered speeches on behalf of the councilors. The audience applauded and welcomed them. The meeting was then adjourned. The ceremony was solemn and grand. The closing speech of Speaker Chiang is recorded as follows: Closing speech of the Third Session of the National Political Council. Vice Speaker Zhang and fellow councilors, the Third Session of the National Political Council is being held at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. Domestic and foreign countries are paying close attention to the progress of our meeting. Over the past ten days, we have all discussed the major plans for the country and the nation in a proactive spirit. When I attended the meeting, I expressed my sincere expectations for this session, and I am fortunate that everyone accepted them. The spirit of sincere unity and harmonious cooperation in this session can only be expressed approximately by the two idioms "gathering of talents" and "harmonious and solemn". Seeing this scene, I have increased my confidence in the future of our nation and the inevitable victory of the war of resistance, and I feel infinitely gratified. During this meeting, the responsible officials of the various ministries and commissions of the government have worked together and made detailed reports. The government has obtained our cooperation. At the same time, all resolutions and suggestions have focused on the urgent needs of the second phase of the war of resistance, and have been concentrated on several specific and constructive points. The number of proposals is not large, but the content is very rich. In particular, many proposals are based on practical experience in participating in the war of resistance, contributing the hardships and joys of personal experience, and putting forward many practical opinions that can benefit the government's implementation. Since the government and this Council are so closely connected, sharing the same hardships and difficulties, I am confident that we will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resisting the war and building the country, and complete our mission of resisting the war and building the country. Now that the Third Session is closed, although the meeting is closed, our work as colleagues to serve the country will not rest for a day. I believe that as long as this Council continues to exert this proactive spirit, openly and honestly assist the government, and do what we should do in a down-to-earth manner, not only can the government obtain a lot of assistance, but it will also enable the people of the country to accept this spirit and work together to strive to strengthen our strength to defeat the enemy, and lay the foundation for national construction after the war. In the history of China's political system, this Council will certainly occupy an important and glorious position. The historical mission of this Council is to establish the foundation of democratic politics, especially the foundation of true democratic politics. I have already mentioned this point in my opening speech at the first meeting. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the Three Principles of the People, and the ultimate goal of his Principle of People's Rights is democratic politics. If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot create a strong country. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on the basis of public opinion, and must take the interests of the people as their interests and the views of the people as their views. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of people's rights is to create a country owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people. There is no difference in principle between ancient and modern times, and between China and foreign countries. We are now resisting the war on the one hand and building the country on the other. To achieve victory in the war of resistance and success in national construction, we must not rely solely on military force. We must mobilize the spirit of the people and organize the people who have already been mobilized. The sum of the spiritual will and strength of the nation will be the backing of the soldiers at the front and the driving force for development in the rear. Therefore, in addition to strengthening military strength, we must mobilize the strength of the people and, more importantly, gather public opinion. The reason why the Provisional National Assembly resolved to convene the National Political Council last year was that, on the one hand, it hoped that the true public opinion of the nation could be concretely expressed through our councilors, so that the government could understand the people's suffering and know the people's hopes as the basis for policy implementation. At the same time, it also hoped that our councilors would represent the people in participating in the major plans of resisting the war and building the country with their status, prestige, experience, and actively contribute our talents and experience to assist the government and guide the people. Then, every action of the government can respond to the people's hearts, and every word and deed of the people can support the government. The success or failure, honor or disgrace of the government is the success or failure, honor or disgrace of the people. The government and the people work together to fight the war, and national construction will be effective. From the process of the formation of this Council, we can know that whether or not China can defeat the enemy and achieve national independence and freedom is certainly the responsibility of the members of this Council, but on the other hand, whether or not China can create a truly democratic political structure during this difficult period of the war of resistance and lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country is also the responsibility of our fellow councilors. (To be continued) (Dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin's Speech on the Opening Day</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Third Session of the National Political Council held its opening ceremony at 8:00 AM on February 12th in Chongqing. A plaque with the words "Love, Unity, and Sincerity" was hung on the stage of the auditorium, with the flag of the Kuomintang and the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the center. The interior and exterior were simply and solemnly decorated. Government officials Kong, President of the Executive Yuan, President Sun, Vice Presidents Zhang Qun, Ye Chucang, Zhen San, Ministers He Yingqin, Weng Wenhao, He Jian, Zhang Jiaao, Central Committee members Ding Huaifen, Lu, Li Wenfan, He Chengjun, Shao Lizi, and 116 councilors including Li Yongxin, and Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and Secretaries Lei Zhen and Gu Xiwu were present. After the music was played, Speaker Chiang led the attendees in performing the ceremony as usual. First, they observed three minutes of silence for the national war dead and the compatriots who died in the disaster. Next, Secretary-General Wang Shijie announced that 116 people had arrived for the Third Session by the time of the opening, which was more than the legal quorum. Then, the Speaker delivered an opening speech (the original text is in another article). After the speech, Secretary-General Wang Shijie read Chairman Lin's speech as follows: "The most important thing about building a republic is the people. Moreover, those who are virtuous and outstanding are superior to the masses. To express their aspirations and feelings is the voice of the people. In the face of great difficulties, it is especially important to provide assistance. A meeting is held to lead the people of the country. Mutual trust and cooperation depend on sincerity. Resisting the war to strengthen the country is a matter of great importance overseas. Assisting in the revitalization and stability is the key. Joint efforts are needed to support the building together. Be aware of the difficulties and dangers, open up the road to the future, eliminate the invaders, and with one heart and one mind, China will be forever strong. Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen." Next, Councilor Hu Yuan, on behalf of all the councilors, delivered a speech welcoming the new Speaker (the speech is omitted). Then, Vice Speaker Zhang Boling delivered a speech, recounting the difficult situation the country has encountered, but will eventually overcome it. He said that he deeply believed that the country and the nation would be able to turn danger into safety. Vice Speaker Zhang repeatedly explained his views, which were enough to enhance the Chinese people's belief in the war of resistance. After the speech, the audience was excited. In addition, there were many congratulatory telegrams from overseas Chinese and various parts of the country to Speaker Chiang on his inauguration and the opening of the Third Session (the speeches are omitted). The meeting was then adjourned after a group photo. (Dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) At the meeting on the 12th, two telegrams were passed, one to comfort the soldiers at the front and the other to comfort the people in the war zones, and both were sent immediately. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>Original Text of Speaker Chiang's Opening Speech</h3>
<p>The following is the original text of Speaker Chiang's opening speech at the Third Session of the National Political Council: "Vice Speaker Zhang and fellow councilors, the National Political Council is holding its Third Session today. I have been ordered by the government to assume the position of Speaker of this Council. In front of the national dignitaries and veterans, I am aware of my shallowness and feel very apprehensive. However, the country is in such a difficult situation that you gentlemen have come from afar with sincere hearts to face the great difficulties of the country and the nation together. I am very moved by this spirit. Since you have come with a spirit of responsibility, duty, and shared security, I dare not fail to encourage myself with one heart and one mind, faith and loyalty. I hope that during this session, I will listen to your great opinions and work together with you to complete the mission of resisting the war and building the country. Although this Council has only been established for eight months, it has already made great contributions to the country. During the two sessions, you have put forward many constructive suggestions on many current domestic and foreign issues. Among them, there are two things that I cannot forget. The first is the resolution to safeguard the national policy passed by the two sessions of this Council. At its first session, this Council passed a resolution to support the "Program for Resisting the War and Building the Country." At its second session, it passed the "National Policy for Maintaining Prolonged Resistance." These two resolutions not only unified the hearts of the people of the country, united the will of the country, and strengthened the strength of the government and the people, but also clarified international views and eliminated all the enemy's rumors and discord, and the conspiracies and tricks to suppress us with spirit. This is most gratifying. The second thing is that in addition to striving to participate in the meetings, many councilors are also engaged in the practical work of resisting the war and building the country outside the meetings. Whether in the war zone or in the rear, there are our councilors who have achieved remarkable results in their efforts to brave dangers, overcome difficulties, and persevere, giving the people of the country a powerful inspiration and letting them know that we not only contribute opinions, but also bravely put them into practice. In particular, many councilors have not spared their efforts to go to the front to inspect military discipline and comfort the soldiers fighting, and although they have been injured, their spirit has remained unwavering, which is even more admirable. Now that the war of resistance has entered its second phase, the responsibilities of our national government and people are even greater, and the responsibilities of this Council are also correspondingly increased. The first phase of the war of resistance laid the foundation for victory. The task of the second phase of the war of resistance is to concentrate and exert all our strength from the front and the rear, and even in the occupied areas, to strive for final victory and success in national construction. In the first phase of the war of resistance, both spirit and matter were equally important. In the second phase of the war of resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of matter. To exert the strength of the war of resistance, we must not only invigorate the spirit and concentrate the spirit, but also focus on spirit and use matter. We must first raise the strong and enterprising spirit of the people of the whole country before we can overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and complete the mission of resisting the war. After the war of resistance entered the second phase, the enemy was already in a dilemma militarily, and was becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more at a loss every day. Recently, the enemy has focused on political malpractice, fabricating facts and sowing discord among the people, with the aim of first subduing our spirit and disintegrating our spirit, and then conquering the entire nation. To break this conspiracy, in addition to continuing to focus on military affairs and material things, we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance. We should not only mobilize all the materials and manpower in the country, but also mobilize the spirit and will of the whole country. We should not only launch the spirit of the whole country, but also organize the spirit that has already been launched, and use the organized spirit to exert the organized manpower."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>These Three Days</h3>
<p>During these three days, there have been no significant unexpected changes at home or abroad.</p>
<p>Our newspaper has been on a three-day break for the winter holiday, and today we resume meeting with our esteemed readers. Because a newspaper serves as the ears, eyes, and voice of society, it should be open for observation and communication day and night, year-round, without interruption. Especially when the world situation is difficult and changes rapidly. Although this three-day break was a last resort, we, as journalists, feel uneasy and deeply ashamed. Fortunately, there have been no major unexpected changes at home or abroad during these three days, which is the first thing we should tell our readers upon our return. As for general developments, there are many things worth recording, which will be chronicled in the news section. Among them, some are particularly worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Starting from the near and moving to the far, let us first talk about Shanghai. These three days mark the end of the business year for all industries in Shanghai. Looking back at the entire year, despite the disruptions to transportation turning Shanghai into a virtual island, the population has surged due to people seeking refuge. Furthermore, abnormal supply and demand have led to rising prices. As a result, at the end of this business year, not only have there been no reports of bankruptcies among businesses in Shanghai, but there is a sense that every household is making a profit. Therefore, in the context of Shanghai as a whole, there is a significant degree of abnormal prosperity and decline, while for the business community, it can be described as an unprecedentedly bountiful year, which is worthy of extensive coverage. At the same time, within these three days, there has been an unusually high number of assassinations in Shanghai, half of which occurred within the concessions and half in areas beyond the reach of the concession police, and none have been solved.</p>
<p>In China: The most noteworthy aspect of politics is the convening of the National Political Council in Chongqing. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech as concurrent speaker, providing incisive and detailed instructions on the past and future of the resistance and nation-building. The full text of his speech is published in the newspaper. It is refined, profound, and extensive, and cannot be captured in a few words. What touches us most deeply is his encouragement to the people to mobilize the entire nation spiritually through words and deeds. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, any talk of total mobilization in any field has become a cliché. The actual achievements are highly questionable. The underlying problems are not just one aspect, but upon closer analysis, one can find a dual personality everywhere as the root cause. What is dual personality? What one hears them say suggests one person, but what one observes them doing suggests another. In public, they are one person, but in private, they are another. When criticizing others, they are one person, but when holding themselves accountable, they are another. The Chinese people have a saying that one should not dismiss a person's words because of their character. When listening to eloquent speakers, one should only consider whether their words align with truth and our own views, without asking what kind of person they are. This is indeed an excellent attitude for diligently seeking truth. However, the resulting drawback is that when one questions their eloquence and examines their actions, one not only finds that their words lack sincerity and fail to move people, but also fundamentally doubts whether what they are eloquently saying is indeed the truth. Is this not why spiritual mobilization since the war of resistance has been superficial and impractical? Chairman Chiang has achieved his greatness through self-discipline, perseverance, and practical action. Now, he is again encouraging people to combine words and actions. This is aimed at addressing the current malpractices. The National Political Council has made many important resolutions, the content of which is yet to be announced. Among them is a resolution to establish a special committee dedicated to reviewing the actual effectiveness of previous resolutions, which is the key to political discussion. As for military affairs, although there have been skirmishes on various fronts every day for the past three days, there have been no large-scale battles. What is most encouraging is that the Chinese Air Force has repeatedly achieved successes, even winning air battles in Lanzhou and Changsha. This at least proves that China's reconstruction of its air force has achieved some success, and what has been demonstrated recently is indicative of this.</p>
<p>Internationally: Within these three days, Germany and Italy have not engaged in any openly shocking actions. The Spanish Civil War is difficult to mediate, but not hopeless. Britain's attitude toward the international situation, through its peaceful actions, demonstrates a certain strength. France is strengthening its defenses in Vietnam and East Africa. Public opinion in the United States is gradually becoming clearer and more hardened. Soviet Russia is silent, but it is gradually distancing itself from the great vortex of the world situation and becoming more detached. In addition, the Netherlands is strengthening its military, Northern Ireland has stated that it cannot remain neutral when Britain goes to war with foreign countries, and Britain and France have successively formally informed the Secretariat of the League of Nations that while they will adhere to the arbitration protocols for international disputes in peacetime, they will no longer be bound by the protocols when the overall situation changes drastically and war breaks out. Although these events cannot be regarded as extremely important developments, they represent, either directly or indirectly, a certain part of their attitude toward the current international phenomenon, and indirectly contribute to stabilizing the international situation. The International Anti-Aggression Conference is being held in London and has resolved to support China against Japan. This has no direct relationship with the actions of various governments. However, China's international trajectory is favorable, like a sharp angle advancing rapidly, while Japan's international isolation is becoming increasingly profound, as can be seen at the Anti-Aggression Conference.</p>
<p>The outline of domestic and international developments during these three days is roughly as described above. In short, all developments are moving toward the watershed between right and wrong, good and bad, benefit and harm, and the distance to the final decision is getting closer and closer. Using organized materials to eliminate aggressive enemies and establish a permanent foundation for nation-building after the war is undoubtedly the most arduous and greatest task and mission in Chinese history. The provisional national representative conference last year decided to convene the National Political Council with the aim of concentrating the nation's strength to overcome unprecedented national difficulties and gathering the nation's will to establish the foundation for nation-building. We can say that the greatest contribution of the National Political Council to the country lies in promoting our unified national spirit and enhancing our inherent national morality. The responsiveness of this spirit and morality extends directly to the people in every province and county, and to every sector of culture, economy, and profession. It can inspire the spirit of shared hatred against the enemy and unwavering perseverance, and inspire the national confidence in the bright future of the nation. As the war of resistance enters its second phase, I believe that strengthening the spirit, focusing the spirit, and leading the national spiritual mobilization with our public discussions and actions should be the central focus of this conference. To unite the national spirit, we must ensure that all people establish a common morality for themselves and a firm common belief in the nation. And every individual can strive, struggle, and sacrifice based on this common moral concept and common national belief. What is this common morality? It is sacrificing the individual self for the greater self. What is our common belief? It is the Three Principles of the People. What is the goal of realizing this belief? It is the highest political ideal of our Chinese people, the world of great harmony. The Book of Rites says, "When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. Talented and virtuous people are selected, and good faith and harmony are emphasized. People do not care only for their own parents and children, so that the elderly are cared for, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled are all provided for. Men have their occupations, and women have their homes. People hate to see goods lying unused on the ground, but they do not necessarily hoard them for themselves. They want to exert their efforts, but not necessarily for their own benefit. Therefore, conspiracies are prevented, and thieves and rebels do not arise." This is truly the goal of our nation-building. Achieving this goal is when the people of the whole country share happiness together, and it is when the Three Principles of the People are truly realized. Gentlemen, today we are shedding blood and sweat in the war of resistance on the one hand, and exhausting our wisdom and efforts in nation-building on the other. The new country that our leader Sun Yat-sen wanted to build is to achieve the state of great harmony described in the Book of Rites. The three points mentioned in the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session: Sincerity, purity, and strengthening unity; Contributing ability, freedom, and life to the country, and actively striving; Concentrating all time and energy to implement construction, political construction, and economic construction—these are, of course, for the war of resistance, but also for nation-building. What we focus on is not only the present, but also the distant future. Since our Chinese ideal of nation-building is a state where everyone does not selfishly reserve their efforts, does not selfishly protect their own bodies, and works diligently and helps each other in peace and happiness, our starting point must be sincere and pure, with shared interests, and truly achieving a world that belongs to all. Our efforts must be active, not passive. At the same time, our strengthened strength must be used to expedite all construction related to nation-building. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session not only hopes that all party members will do so, but especially hopes that all compatriots in the country, especially social leaders, will unanimously accept and implement it. Gentlemen, our councilors are all social leaders with rich knowledge and experience. The government, on the one hand, concentrates national talent with the sincerity of "selecting the talented and virtuous" to share the responsibility of the country. At the same time, it hopes to use the four words "emphasizing good faith and harmony" as the foundation for uniting the nation's strength. Therefore, what I sincerely hope from all fellow councilors is that everyone first establish mutual trust and common faith, be open and honest with each other, and create an attitude of harmony and kinship, like brothers and sisters. There is nothing that cannot be spoken frankly, and there is nothing that cannot be understood together. On the one hand, you should collect public opinion as much as possible and earnestly represent public opinion to promote and develop public welfare, knowing everything and saying everything, so that there is complete mutual understanding, integration, and communication between the government and society, without the slightest obstruction. On the other hand, I also hope that you will, with a broad and compassionate mind, implement what our predecessors called "not caring only for their own parents and children," integrating the interests of one person, one family, one village, and one place into the interests of the whole country and the entire nation. We must extend the heart of kinship to respecting the elderly, caring for the poor, and helping our suffering compatriots, and alleviating the country's difficulties. We must extend the heart of loving our own children to loving all the youth in the country, nurturing all the youth in the country, giving them good role models, and guiding them to the path of sincerity, purity, and common struggle for the country, in order to consolidate the long-term life of our nation. If our councilors can lead the country with this spirit, I dare say that "the war of resistance will be won, and the nation-building will be successful." The ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the world of great harmony, will also be realized. In order to specifically illustrate my personal hopes, I will not hesitate to repeatedly put forward two points of view. I believe that after these two points are fully realized, the contribution of our Council to the current war of resistance and nation-building will be even greater, our spirit of sharing national difficulties will be even more evident and bright, and the spirit of our national sages, talents, and leaders can be uplifted, the will of the government and the people can be connected, and the strength of the government and the people can be concentrated. This kind of effect is more than ten times greater than raising the spirit of bravery and sacrifice of the officers and soldiers at the front. What are the two points of hope that I am talking about? First, this conference must fully demonstrate an active spirit. The establishment of our Council is different from the parliaments of ordinary countries. Our organization, spirit, establishment environment, and process are all unprecedented in the history of world politics, and our achievements in the past two conferences, avoiding the common habits of ordinary parliaments as much as possible, are even more something we can be proud of in the world. Now, the work of resistance and nation-building is even more urgent. In order to save time and increase efficiency, I believe that we should go a step further, reduce unimportant proposals as much as possible, and focus more on active, constructive, and practical suggestions and discussions. I remember that at the last conference, a case concerning the method of reviewing original drafts was discussed for a long time, consuming valuable time during the war of resistance. Today, you must all understand that our government is a revolutionary government, a responsible government, and a government that fully relies on public opinion and justice. As long as it does not violate the interests of resistance and nation-building, the government has no reason to restrict the rights of the people. Therefore, every member of our Council does not need to overthink personal interests and freedoms, lest they neglect the overall interests of the country. Today, we must maximize our initiative and avoid the passivity that we have been infected with for thousands of years. Our past national character, such as suspicion, friction, prevention, and confrontation, is all biased towards passivity, which not only cannot promote all undertakings, but also consumes much useful energy and hinders much progress, and even delays national affairs. We only see the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties, not because of military incompetence, nor because there was absolutely no patriotic and people-loving sages, but because everyone cherished their own ideas, established their own factions, were selfish and self-serving, and had divergent opinions, which made it impossible to unify the spirit and disperse the will and strength. Looking at the partial interests as higher than the overall interests of the nation, today's compatriots must set a good example for the people of the whole country and future generations, and must replace passivity with activity, replace destruction with construction, and replace suspicion and rejection with mutual assistance and unity. Therefore, this term of our work should focus more on suggestions for all practical plans and methods in the later stage of the war of resistance, and should especially promote the spirit of public loyalty, national unity, and common defense against foreign aggression. All discussions and suggestions should be filled with initiative. Second, this conference should fully promote the spirit of sincerity, purity, mutual trust, and common faith. The country has reached this point today, and if we sit idly by and do not save it, who will save it? The interests of the country and the nation, if we do not cherish and protect them, who will cherish and protect them? We must integrate the individual and the country into one person's strength, and make it become the country's strength. The individual's will must obey the country's will. The country must first gain freedom, and then the individual can truly enjoy freedom. Everyone puts the interests of the country and the nation first, and extend it to others, believing that the people of the Republic of China have the conscience to love their country. With common faith, there must be mutual trust. How can we achieve sincerity and purity? Being willing to sacrifice for the interests of the country and the nation is sincerity. Having no other distracting thoughts outside the country and the nation is purity. We are not afraid to die for the country, let alone other things. We all stand on the interests of the country and the nation, and our publicity must be for the country and the nation, our actions must be for the country and the nation, and even our thoughts must be for the country and the nation. We must make sincere efforts in ourselves, but we must strive purely for the country. We must absolutely believe in each other in people and affairs, and then we can generate common strength to deal with common enemies and accomplish our common aspirations. The people in charge of the government today, if not for the future of the country and the nation, would never be so willing to work hard and bear the burden. If you are not for the future of the country and the nation, you would not work so hard to share the national difficulties. Therefore, the understanding between the government and our councilors is consistent, and the goals are also consistent. We have a common faith in the future of the country and the nation, and we have mutual trust in each other. This can break down all barriers, eliminate all prejudices, and achieve a degree of affection, sincerity, and pragmatism, helping each other in times of difficulty and danger. As long as we rely on this sincerity, any difficulties can be overcome, and any undertaking will be successful. The two points mentioned above are very ordinary thoughts, but the hopes are very sincere. Since the war of resistance, Zhongzheng has been entrusted with a heavy responsibility, and his spirit and will are always connected with all of our colleagues. Now that he has taken over as the speaker of this conference, he has more opportunities to contact you. We can further work together, learn from each other, and share the responsibility in this important mission of resistance and nation-building. I really feel grateful and happy. However, I ask myself to be foolish and clumsy, and I am afraid that I am not enough to live up to the expectations of my colleagues. In the future, if there are any shortcomings in Zhongzheng's personal views, or any mistakes or faults, or inconsistencies in words and deeds, or any insincerity or dishonesty, or inability to fulfill his duties, I hope that you will not hesitate to teach and correct him at any time, so as not to betray this position. Zhongzheng relies only on this foolish loyalty and red heart for the country and the people, and is willing to share weal and woe with everyone, share honor and disgrace, be of one heart and one mind, and carry through to the end, in order to fulfill our mission to resist the war and build the nation, and to answer the expectations of the government and the people of the whole country.

<h3>The British Government Is Considering Continuing Economic Aid to China; British Businesses Operating Inland China Shipping Do Not Recognize Japan's Right to Control</h3>
<p>(London) During today's session of the House of Commons, opposition Labour MP Mr. Burke inquired as to what financial measures the government plans to take to aid China, in accordance with the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly last September. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler replied, "This matter is still under consideration, and it is inconvenient to make any statements at this time, which I deeply regret." Mr. Burke then declared, "If the government can take any action in this matter, it will receive the greatest support from the House and the people of the whole country." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently announced that the British government is currently considering a plan to stabilize the value of China's legal tender. Furthermore, due to the establishment of the law expanding the authority of the Export Credits Guarantee Department of the Board of Trade, new trade facilities can be granted to China. In short, the British government will continue to implement its policy of assisting China within the bounds of the law. If Japan becomes embroiled in a serious dispute with France due to the occupation of Hainan Island, the British government will take even tougher measures in accordance with the Anglo-French cooperative policy to deal with it. Regarding the proposal to retaliate against Japan by economic means, no one expressed dissent at yesterday morning's cabinet subcommittee meeting, but a decision was not made to take immediate action. It is generally believed that while the situation in Europe is not yet stable, Britain should proceed cautiously in the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) During today's session of the House of Commons, several members inquired about the expansion of the narcotics trade controlled by Japanese forces in the Shanghai area and various parts of North China occupied by Japanese forces. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Butler replied that the information he has received does not indicate any significant changes to the situation described on December 22 of last year. However, he believes that the Japanese authorities may now be aware of the dangers that accompany the development of the drug trade and may be trying to deal with them. A member also asked about the investigation regarding the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company, which I have already reported as completed. Mr. Butler replied that the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Phillips, reported that the company is still operating its business but has encountered some difficulties and is currently being reorganized to become a subsidized enterprise of the companies initiated by the Japanese government. The British authorities have protested to the Japanese authorities, stating that the British government does not recognize Japan's right to impose any control measures on British ships operating inland China shipping.

<h3>Democratic Nations Should Cooperate to Stop Japanese Aggression; Anti-Aggression Congress Passes Resolutions; Zhang Pengchun Believes China Will Win the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(London) The Executive Committee of the World Anti-Aggression Congress today passed two resolutions. The first advocates that all countries should: (1) prohibit the shipment of munitions to Japan; (2) establish an international agreement to boycott Japanese goods; (3) the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union should genuinely cooperate to assist China and stop aggression, and refuse to supply aggressor nations with money or other war necessities. The original text stated, "If the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union can genuinely cooperate at this time, it will not be difficult for China to win the war against the aggressor as a result of its heroic resistance." The second is related to the Spanish Civil War, stating that although the World Anti-Aggression Congress wishes to see an early end to the fratricide among the Spanish people, it opposes placing any pressure on the legitimate government of that country to force it to surrender unconditionally. Peace-loving nations should establish an agreement to guarantee the following: (1) respect Spain's political and economic independence and sovereignty; (2) immediately withdraw foreign combatants and prevent foreign forces from controlling Spain; (3) after the cessation of hostilities between the parties involved in the civil war, no Spaniard should be mistreated for their political views during the war. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Anti-Aggression Congress held in London today, a letter from Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was read, expressing gratitude for the material and spiritual assistance given to China by the Congress, and declaring China's determination to continue the war of resistance. The meeting was attended by sixty representatives from seventeen countries. Zhang Pengchun addressed the audience, stating that China has always been confident that final victory will belong to China, and this confidence is now even stronger than at the beginning of the war. Events in the Far East and Europe are interrelated. The concessions made during the tense situation in Europe last September led to the Japanese attack on Guangzhou. The occupation of Hainan Island is another new blow to Britain and France, as the island is a strategically important point that can be used to attack Hong Kong, Annam, and the Philippines. Japan will now use Hainan Island as a base for its air force and submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>China Rebuilding Air Force</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to official sources, the expansion and reconstruction of the Chinese Air Force in 1939 is now actively underway. When the war began 19 months ago, China had only 300 front-line aircraft and 1,200 combat personnel. During the war, the strength of the Air Force has been damaged, making it necessary to rebuild it. According to Mr. Qian Dajun, Secretary-General of the Aviation Commission, the goals of rebuilding the Air Force include (1) increasing the number of front-line aircraft to 500, (2) training more aviation talents, and (3) building more airfields in the interior. In addition, the principles are (1) maintaining a front-line aircraft count of 500, (2) replenishing them monthly as needed, (3) restoring and increasing manufacturing capacity, (4) increasing the efficiency of repair work, (5) providing rigorous training to aviation personnel, (6) building more and better airfields, (7) consolidating the ranks of senior aviation personnel and improving the entire administration of the Aviation Commission. Also, when the war began, the Japanese sent 200 aircraft to China, which had increased several times by the end of last year, totaling 826, including 330 in North China, 120 in Guangdong and Fujian, and 376 in Central China. To date, the number of Japanese aircraft operating in China has increased to 1,200, accounting for 60% of the total strength of the Japanese Air Force. It is said that the Japanese Air Force has suffered extremely heavy losses. According to recent reports, to date, a total of 219 Japanese aircraft have been shot down, 179 Japanese aircraft have been destroyed or severely damaged, and 39 Japanese pilots have been captured. In addition, 145 Japanese warships have been damaged by Chinese aircraft bombing and 40 have been sunk. Since the January 28th Incident, the Chinese government has hired American and Italian training groups to train the Chinese Air Force. They have done an excellent job, but the rapid development of the Chinese Air Force is largely due to General Chiang Kai-shek. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>

Recently, according to a certain dispatch, the Japanese army is quite troubled by the Chinese guerrilla forces along the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei, and is gradually attempting to pressure the Dabie Mountains in order to prevent Chinese forces from flanking them when they attack west. However, the strength of the Chinese guerrilla forces is increasing daily.

<h3>Japanese Forces Withdraw from the Yangtze River Basin; Now Fewer Than 200,000 Troops</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Japanese forces in the Yangtze River basin have recently made large-scale withdrawals. People from all walks of life in China are puzzled as to why. It is now known that the withdrawn Japanese forces have gathered in the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong in North China and are now engaged in suppressing guerrilla forces in North China. There is currently fierce fighting in central Hebei Province, with Japanese forces attempting to encircle General Lu Zhonglin, chairman of Hebei Province, and the troops of Generals Zhang Yingwu and Sun Lianzhong. According to reliable sources here, there are now fewer than 200,000 Japanese troops in the Yangtze River basin. Japanese forces have abandoned many cities and towns between Beijing and Hankou, so Huangmei in eastern Hubei and Hukou below Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province are now back under Chinese control. It is reported that Japanese forces have also withdrawn from the entire area east of the Ping-Han Railway in northeastern Hubei Province. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Actively Enhances National Strength, Aiming to Lay a Foundation for Resistance Against Japan, Industrializing the Far East Region, Pursuing a Policy of Appeasement Towards Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Observers here recently declared that, for several months, Soviet Russian foreign policy has undergone significant changes. While the principle of collective security has not been publicly abandoned, it has leaned towards a policy of appeasement towards the omnipotent nations of Europe. Towards Japan, it has adopted a relatively tough stance, but without resorting to severe measures. Instead, it is intensifying industrialization and land reclamation policies in the Far East region to enhance national strength and lay the foundation for resistance. For example, coal production must be doubled, and 75% of planned iron smelters will be located in the Far East region. Once the Third Five-Year Economic Plan is implemented, most factories will be moved from the Soviet Russian mainland to Siberia. Furthermore, the Soviet Russian authorities are demanding the full recovery of thirty Japanese fishing grounds in the coastal strategic zones of the Primorsky Krai. They will also restrict Japanese business operations in the area, such as the North Sakhalin Japanese Oil Company. Such measures will be promoted in an orderly manner. However, the Soviet Russian authorities are also well aware that their navy is not yet a match for Japan, so they do not want to completely expel Japanese fishermen from Soviet Russian territorial waters to avoid retaliatory actions by the Japanese navy. As for Japan in the eyes of the Soviet Union, due to the uncertainty of when the Sino-Japanese War will end, Japan has no remaining strength to take large-scale military action against Russia. The occupation of Hainan Island by Japanese forces is seen as an echo of Germany and Italy, threatening France and Britain. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The recent changes in Soviet Russia's foreign policy are clearly due to the various developments in the international situation. This has also been mentioned by local radio stations and newspapers. It is claimed that since the Munich Agreement, the actions of France and Britain have effectively released Soviet Russia from its obligations. Since then, Soviet Russia has been completely free in dealing with various international issues and is not subject to any constraints. If war breaks out in Europe, Soviet Russia can stay out of it, similar to the situation of the United States not being drawn into the vortex. At the same time, no matter how Soviet Russia and Germany get along, the Soviet Russian side will never ask its neighbors to take sides between Russia and Germany. In other words, those countries can maintain friendly relations with both Russia and Germany simultaneously. In addition, regarding the plan of Finland and Sweden to build fortifications on the Åland Islands in the Baltic Sea, Soviet Russia will not raise any objections. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Policy Changes, Promoting Relations with the Soviet Union, Minister of Overseas Trade Visits Moscow, Politically Significant</h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, will visit Moscow and other places in the second half of March to implement the British government's desire to increase and strengthen relations with other governments, and will pay special attention to the possibilities of trade relations. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently announced in the House of Commons that the Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, is scheduled to visit Moscow in late March. Well-informed sources here say that this trip is of great political significance, but official circles say that this trip is only intended to adjust the commercial agreement signed between Britain and the Soviet Union in 1936. When Hudson goes to Moscow, he will be accompanied by the Director of the Economic Department of the Foreign Office, Ward King (currently in Berlin), to visit the Nordic countries en route, to discuss the adjustment of British commercial relations with those countries, especially the issue of increasing British exports. In short, Sir Seeds, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, has made many efforts to promote relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Hudson's visit to the Soviet Union is indeed a signal of Britain's political and economic reconciliation with the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that Hudson, the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, will travel to Moscow and other northern European capitals in late March. Currently, Hudson and Stanley, the Minister of the Department of Overseas Trade, are preparing to go to Berlin to discuss British-German trade relations. It is rumored that Hudson will also visit Poland and Finland. The current plan is to go from Berlin to Warsaw, then to Moscow, and return home via Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The main purpose of this trip is to persuade industrialists from various countries to purchase more British-made products. Recently, the Department of Overseas Trade has received complaints from manufacturers and chambers of commerce, referring to British-Soviet trade as one-sided. Hudson will now draw the attention of the Soviet authorities to this request. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>British and German Economic Talks, Seeking to Ease Trade Competition</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Ward King, Director of the Economic Department of the British Foreign Office, has arrived in Berlin to conduct economic talks between Britain and Germany. These talks will continue until the arrival of Stanley, the British Minister of Overseas Trade. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Financial and economic circles here generally believe that Germany's economic situation is extremely difficult, food is particularly scarce, and the people are suffering greatly. Although the country is expanding its political influence everywhere, it is not enough to alleviate the economic situation. If the country's current economic policy is not changed, a serious crisis will soon arrive, without a doubt. Some people in the country also deeply know that isolation is not a good plan and are willing to promote economic relations with other countries. This can be seen from the country's commercial negotiations with various countries and the upcoming visit of a delegation from the British Confederation of Industries to Germany. It is hoped that the future negotiations between Britain and Germany can strengthen the power enjoyed by these people, and that Germany can abandon its dumping policy and establish an agreement with Britain to avoid mutual competition in the world market. Otherwise, Britain is prepared to implement a dumping policy and use Germany's spear to attack Germany's shield. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Soviet-Polish Trade Agreement Established, Based on the Most Favored Nation Principle</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After weeks of negotiations, the Soviet Union and Poland signed an agreement here on the 19th to adjust all economic relations between the two countries, including a commercial treaty, a goods exchange agreement, and a clearing agreement. The Soviet representative signing the agreement was Mikoyan, Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade, and the Polish representative was Lichovski, Chairman of the Commercial Negotiation Delegation and Ambassador to the Soviet Union. This agreement is the first general economic treaty concluded between the two countries based on the most-favored-nation principle. It includes several basic provisions regarding the exchange of goods and shipping. Regarding the exchange of goods, the agreement has expanded the volume of trade between the two sides. The Soviet Union mainly exports cotton, cotton yarn ends, furs, apatite, tobacco, manganese ore, asbestos, pencil lead, etc. to Poland. Poland exports coal, iron, zinc, cotton fabrics, cotton textile machinery, leather, and trace elements to the Soviet Union. The clearing agreement stipulates that the payment of prices and other matters should be resolved by the Polish Accounting Institute with the consent of both parties. (TASS dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Defense Budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer Requests Issuance of Huge Amount of Public Debt, So That Military Build-Up Plans Can Be Completed on Schedule</h3>
<p>(London) When British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon moved in the House of Commons today to pass a bill to increase the government's defense borrowing power to 800 million pounds, the two-day debate on defense in the House of Commons began. Simon said that this borrowing power not only involves the army, navy, and air force, but also includes air raid prevention and food storage. The British military build-up plan is intended to be completed within five years, and according to the original estimates, it will cost about 1.5 billion pounds. In the first three years, a total of 1.25 billion pounds is needed for the army, navy, air force, and civil defense. It is now estimated that defense spending will be 406 million pounds by the end of March 1940, of which 274 million pounds will be compensated from national income, and the remaining 130 million pounds will be taken from debt. He felt that the fiscal year 1939-40 will be a period of great economic development and one of the most substantial progress. It is estimated that defense spending in that year will be 580 million pounds, of which 230 million pounds will be covered by taxes, and the remaining 350 million pounds must be paid for by debt. In the first three years of the 1.25 billion pounds of defense spending, a total of 700 million pounds will be covered by taxes, and the rest must be financed by debt. The government has decided that there are sufficient reasons to raise debt to finance the military build-up plan. The financial resources required for defense are greater than what taxes can bear, and this point is probably generally recognized by the people of the country. Since the military build-up plan must be completed within a limited five-year period, it would seem unfair to clear all the expenses within five years. However, the people of the country must express their willingness to bear it year by year, so there is a proposal to increase the government's borrowing power so that it can be repaid gradually by tax revenue year by year. The estimates of the army, navy, and air force will be released in a few days. He estimated that 230 million pounds could be allocated from tax revenue, and the remaining 350 million pounds should be raised by debt. The people of the country must know that the number of defense expenditures actually includes civil defense. In the period from 1932 to 1935, the country had witnessed a prosperous trend, so the burden taken from the people in 1931 could be reduced a lot. In the past three years, the British people have increased income tax three times, totaling one shilling more per pound. In addition, there is a temporary defense tax, which will be fully harvested in the next year. We are born at this time, just in time for the opportunity to bear this burden, but we must not lose our current responsibility, nor can we incur the condemnation of future generations. All the repayment terms of the debt are clearly stipulated. When an administrative department is allowed by the National Assembly to issue public debt, an annual interest of 3% will be borne by the department until the end of the five-year period, after which the principal and interest will be paid to the Ministry of Finance in 30 installments.</p>
<p>Simon then put forward the following proposals: (1) To increase the borrowing power approved by the 1937 Defense Public Debt Act from 400 million pounds to 800 million pounds; (2) To redefine the definition of defense so that the debt raised can be used for civil defense and to fund the necessary goods preparation fund. Simon continued that civil defense is becoming an increasingly important part of the entire national defense today. It is regrettable that the world has used such huge sums of money for this purpose instead of using it to promote peace (loud cheers from the audience). If general disarmament is achieved, it will definitely improve the situation, but if we still have to bear this burden, then we should at least know that other countries also feel that the burden is no lighter than ours. We should also know that our country, with its financial resources and other sources of benefits, as well as the characteristics of the British people and their belief in democracy, will definitely be able to take on difficult tasks. Labor Party Dalton, representing the opposition Labor Party, moved a formal amendment to reduce the borrowing power by 100 million pounds, saying that the total amount of defense spending was too high and unprecedented in peacetime. If this money is used on the assumption that a great war will occur, then there should be protection measures for those who stay in the country to engage in production. He hoped that the government would declare to the House of Commons that it would not reject the House of Commons' request to allocate funds to build deep bomb shelters. The Labor Party had no reason to trust the government's defense plan. Liberal Party Shelley, representing the opposition Liberal Party, said that we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that we are using this huge amount of money due to the German threat. Now that we have used this huge amount of money, we should strive to ensure that when the threat comes, we are prepared. The issue of the future expeditionary force will definitely become a very big event. In terms of the army, what we are facing now is even more serious than what we had before the last European war, because we now know that Germany's peacetime army is about one million people. Although we are using this huge amount of money in the country, it is still a major issue whether we will send our troops to join forces with the European army. He felt that continuing the military build-up may not be able to promote the most complete security possible, and it seemed appropriate to make extra efforts in the area of collective security. Simon's remarks on raising defense funds were well received by all parties. Many people believed that there would be no further increase in income tax in the next year. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Italy Increases Troops in Libya, Clearly Contradicting the British-Italian Agreement, British Members of Parliament Question the Undersecretary of State Who is Almost Unable to Cope</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, many members of Parliament questioned the Undersecretary of State, Butler, who seemed almost unable to cope, as to whether Italy's repeated increase of troops in its North African Libyan territory contradicted the British-Italian agreement. He first said that since the 8th of this month, the Foreign Office had not received any reports of Italy increasing its troops in Libya. Until recently, the Italian government had notified British Ambassador Sir Payne that, in order to maintain the security of Libya, it would send 30,000 more troops to the area for defense. Once the official departure is made, the British government will be notified in accordance with the military intelligence exchange measures contained in the British-Italian agreement. Henderson, the opposition Labor Party member of Parliament, then asked, "Italy's repeated increase of troops in Libya contradicts the British-Italian agreement." Butler again answered with ambiguous words, "The Italian government has promised to reduce the number of troops stationed in Libya to 30,000, which should not be considered a violation of the British-Italian agreement." Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labor Party, immediately declared, "According to the British-Italian agreement, this number of troops stationed should have been reduced. Now Undersecretary of State Butler says so, is it that this agreement must be implemented at a later date?" Butler replied, "Regarding this matter, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano made a commitment to the British government in a letter dated April 16 of last year. This promise has actually been fulfilled." Major Attlee said again, "Then the so-called reduction in the number of troops is a temporary measure, and it can still be increased afterwards, is that the case?" (All members of the opposition party laughed upon hearing this). Butler replied again, "The Italian Foreign Minister's letter does not involve the permanent application of this level." At this point, Sinclair, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, also asked, "After the government added 30,000 troops to Libya, is the number of troops stationed there the same as the original number before the British-Italian agreement was signed? In other words, is it the same as the number of troops before the reduction?" Butler replied, "Yes, that is indeed the case." (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>With British and French Cooperation and Mediation, the End of the Spanish War is Not Far Off, The Two Countries Will Soon Recognize the Franco Regime, French Officials Have Cordial Talks in Burgos</h3>
<p>(London) The Times diplomatic correspondent said on Sunday that when Britain recognizes the Franco government in the future, former Air Force Minister Swinton may be appointed as the British ambassador to Burgos. According to the newspaper's Paris dispatch, Paris believes that the Spanish armistice treaty is expected to be established at the end of this month. It is rumored that Western countries are currently requesting General Franco to give assurances that (1) he will not join the Anti-Comintern Pact, (2) he will not form a close alliance with Italy and Germany, and (3) he will not allow British loans to be transferred to the treasuries of Germany and Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government, well-informed sources here recently declared that the current situation should not be delayed. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the current diplomatic negotiations, the British government will recognize the Nationalist government as the legal government within this week. The reason why it has not yet been implemented is to wait for the negotiations between French right-wing Senator Pétain and the Nationalist government to come to an end, and to satirize the Republican government to make it understand that the Nationalist government will be recognized sooner or later. It is better to surrender unconditionally. As for the issue of amnesty for Spanish political prisoners, although Britain and France have repeatedly made representations, General Franco has not yet publicly promised guarantees. At this time, the only thing that can be hoped for is that the Nationalist government will make vague promises, stating that it does not intend to take advantage of the victory to severely punish dissidents politically. Such promises will have no binding force, but Prime Minister Chamberlain can report to the House of Commons that the authorities of the Spanish Nationalist government will definitely not go too far. Then, in legal terms, recognition can be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Burgos French right-wing Senator Pétain, bearing a mandate, came here and held talks with General Jordana, the National Government's aide and foreign minister, as well as the heads of the European, cultural, and political departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for a total of six hours yesterday afternoon. According to well-informed sources, the atmosphere was originally very gloomy when they started talking, but it improved by evening. According to well-informed sources, the talks were limited to the issue of establishing diplomatic relations and did not involve the issue of mediating the domestic war. Pétain has already reported the process and his impressions to Foreign Minister Bonnet via long-distance telephone today, and will submit a written report to the Foreign Minister tomorrow. He will continue to meet with General Jordana on the 22nd of this month, or he may return to Paris the next day, which is not certain. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Nationalist Government Will Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Biarritz According to intelligence from well-informed sources, Spanish General Franco is currently planning to reorganize his government, and will appoint the current Minister of the Interior, Suñer, as the Prime Minister, while Franco himself will remain the head of state and commander-in-chief of the army. Suñer has a marriage relationship with Franco and is one of the most active leaders. It is heard that Franco plans to reduce the number of cabinet members to eight, and the rest will be appointed as secretaries. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain Recognizes in Principle That the Arabs Can Enjoy Political Independence, Restrictions Must be Placed on Jewish Immigration to Palestine</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of Palestine, the British authorities recently declared that the cabinet has decided in principle to recognize the Arab people's right to political independence in the Palestinian region, and to restrict the number of Jews immigrating to Palestine and the number of land purchases to avoid endangering the special status of the Arab people. In addition, a constitution will be promulgated for the Palestinian region, stipulating that the Arab and Jewish people are equal in politics. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Cliff, Battle Situation: Self-Defense Corps and Strong Young Men Rise Up to Resist Japan; Leizhou Peninsula Greatly Threatened</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Guangdong, after occupying Hainan Island on the morning of the 10th, have continued their aggression for several days, not ceasing due to protests from France and England. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army used transport ships to carry 5,000 soldiers, assisted by more than 20 gunboats and three large squadrons of aircraft, first landing at Haikou City. Chinese troops were stationed in Haikou, and the Xiuying Fort had returned fire, bombarding the Japanese ships, but ultimately were outnumbered and the fort was too close to the coast, resulting in it being controlled by Japanese warships and aircraft. The Chinese troops, for strategic reasons, then moved to a new position. After the Japanese army landed in Haikou, they advanced southward, pushing into the hinterland, dividing into three routes to attack Ding'an, Chengmai, and Wenchang. Until the 13th, several thousand Chinese troops and local forces on Hainan Island were still guarding the Fuhai Highway (from Qiongshan County Fucheng to Haikou), intercepting the enemy step by step. At the same time, heavy troops were stationed in Anren, south of Qiongshan County, to protect the Chengmai-Ding'an line, and the situation is still stalemated. After being blocked, the Japanese army has dispatched planes for several days to bomb cities such as Wenchang, burning civilian houses and causing civilians to flee to the interior. It is heard that the Japanese army has landed one division and two marine corps in Haikou over the past three days. The Chinese troops in Ding'an front are now under the command of Wang Yi, commander of the Hainan Island Garrison, and Yun Zhenzhong, deputy commander. Wu Daonan, commissioner of the Ninth District Administrative Inspectorate, has also mobilized local armed groups to cooperate with the regular army. Currently, the self-defense corps and strong young men teams from Ding'an, Wenchang, Nada, Jiaji, and other counties and cities have been dispatched, no less than 80,000 to 90,000 people. The authorities have ordered the coastal officials of Hainan Island to completely destroy the roads within three days, and all food must be moved to the interior. When the Japanese army landed in Haikou on the morning of the 10th, in order to contain the Chinese troops, they sent a part of their troops, protected by several ships, to forcibly land at Yulin Port (belonging to Yaxian County) at the southern end of Hainan Island. This was discovered by the Chinese local forces, who met them with a head-on attack. The Japanese army's attempt to seize the port was actually because there were huge salt fields near the port, and they intended to take the opportunity to loot salt, but the salt had been transported away by the Chinese troops in advance, and considerable forces were stationed at the port to guard it. Therefore, the Japanese army tried to land at Yulin Port twice that day, but both attempts failed.</p>
<p>Hainan Island is geographically isolated from the mainland, north of the Leizhou Peninsula, separated only by a strait. The coastal areas are all plains, with no natural defenses. The central mountains run vertically, making it defensible and attackable. The island has a population of about 3 million, with the Li ethnic group accounting for three-tenths, known for their bravery and combativeness. Strategically, the defending troops are bound to abandon the coastal counties, but even if the Japanese army has landed, it will face significant difficulties in defense. The Wuzhi Mountain area in the center is mostly plateau, with mountain caves reaching 5,000 feet above sea level. Furthermore, with the defense works that the Chinese army has long operated, the Japanese air force will likely have difficulty exerting its power. After the coastal residents fled the war zone, they have now moved to the mountainous areas. Hainanese people residing in Hong Kong have formulated relief measures for the refugees yesterday, immediately establishing the Hainan Island Refugee Relief Association, and sending telegrams to Hainanese people overseas and inland to donate funds for relief, while purchasing food and chartering ships to provide assistance. At the same time, they have also telegraphed the China Relief Council to allocate funds for assistance.</p>
<p>The Japanese army has stated that occupying Hainan Island is a base for invading the southern part of Guangdong Province and the border of Guangxi, strengthening the blockade of South China's international transportation routes. The French fleet has paid close attention and sailed to Haikou to investigate the actual actions of the Japanese army. The authorities of the Chinese troops in southern Guangdong are actively deploying defenses in preparation for any eventuality. The Qinlian area is the only way to enter Guangxi. In addition to building defensive works, elite troops from Guangdong and Guangxi have been added to guard every section, and mechanized units have been transferred to annihilate the enemy. The highway from Qinxian to Nanning has been destroyed in sections, and the defense is very thorough. After Haikou on Hainan Island was occupied by the Japanese army, the Leizhou Peninsula on the opposite shore was greatly threatened. Xuwen and Haikang counties protrude into the sea and are threatened by the enemy on both sides. Yesterday, it was reported that Japanese warships were cruising in the waters of Haian Port in Xuwen, and the county authorities have made war preparations. However, according to general observation, although the Leizhou Peninsula is connected to Hainan Island, it is still worrying. However, because the northeast of the peninsula has the French Guangzhou Bay, if the Japanese army invades the Leizhou Peninsula again, it will lead to direct conflict between Japan and France, creating more diplomatic complications. It is expected that after the Japanese army occupies Hainan Island, Xuwen and other counties may be able to survive temporarily. However, this is a theoretical speculation, and it cannot be applied to those who are crazy about militarism. (February 14)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Yangxian Shao Attempted to Invade East, But Failed; They Immediately Withdrew After Suffering Heavy Losses, But Wasted a Lot of Ammunition</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army in Yangzhou and its subordinate areas of Xiannvmiao and Shaobo have been attempting to invade eastward for days. On the 13th, two trucks departed from Yangzhou, loaded with 60-70 Japanese soldiers, four cannons, and 18 boxes of shells, heading to Xiannvmiao and Shaobo. The Japanese army in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo also purchased a large amount of food and supplies, actively preparing for an eastward invasion. On the morning of the 14th, Yangzhou sent over 100 more Japanese soldiers to Xiannvmiao, joining the original garrison there, totaling about 400 soldiers. They then divided into three routes to set out. The first route advanced from Xiannvmiao to Zhangwanggou. At the same time, the Japanese artillery in Xiannvmiao fired dozens of shells from Henan, covering the advance. They arrived at Zhangwanggou around 11:00 AM. The Chinese troops there, in order to avoid the real and attack the empty, had already gathered at a certain location. The Japanese army attacked an empty camp and immediately withdrew, burning down a bathhouse and a temple in the town and looting a large amount of food such as chickens, ducks, and pork. The second route, with over 200 soldiers, set out from Xiannvmiao at the same time, attempting to invade Zhuanqiao. They arrived at Sanguantang, about three miles away from Zhuanqiao, and, knowing that the Chinese troops were prepared, did not dare to act rashly. Around 3:00 PM, they all withdrew. The third route, with over 100 soldiers, carrying four small steel cannons, set out at 6:00 AM to harass Dahanzitou. Dahanzitou is more than ten miles northeast of Xiannvmiao. The Japanese army had suffered a great defeat there by the guerrillas, so this time they planned to vigorously "suppress" this guerrilla force. However, the guerrillas had already dispersed into smaller units, and the Japanese army's attempt completely failed. They then conducted a large-scale search in the area and set fire to the Doutian Temple, withdrawing around 1:00 PM. In total, the Japanese army gained nothing from this operation and wasted a lot of ammunition. After the Japanese army withdrew to Xiannvmiao, they immediately set up a cannon and a small steel cannon at the east and west ends of the town, guarding against a Chinese counterattack.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle in Wuzhen; Chinese Troops Launch a Large-Scale Counterattack; Rumor Has It That the Japanese Army Has Collapsed and Retreated</h3>
<p>Tongxiang Correspondence: After Wuzhen, which belongs to Tongxiang County, was occupied by the Japanese army some time ago, the various Chinese troops were concentrated outside the Zha Shan, etc., and reorganized and redeployed by the captain Zhu. Together with a friendly army division, they repeatedly contacted the Japanese army in the four suburbs. Due to their weak forces, the Japanese army only relied on fortifications to resist stubbornly. It is reported that the Chinese troops began a general counterattack on the 17th, and the battle was fierce. The sound of gunfire did not cease from morning to night, which was unprecedented since the anti-Japanese war in western Zhejiang. According to those who fled from there, the casualties on both sides were heavy, and corpses were scattered everywhere. By dusk, the Japanese army was unable to hold on and retreated towards the south fence. There were also more than 20 Japanese motorboats in Baimatang, about two or three miles away from Wuzhen, fully loaded with soldiers, seemingly sailing from Jiaxing to reinforce Wuzhen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Harass Dinghai; Open Fire and Bombard the Coastline</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Two Japanese warships arrived in the Qianjiang River area of Datoutou, in this county, at noon on the 17th. After dropping anchor, they removed the gun covers. At 1:00 PM, they opened fire and bombarded the coastline, firing a total of eleven shots. The Chinese side suffered little damage. The Japanese warships retreated immediately after the shelling.</p>
<h3>The Puppet Tax Office in Kunshan Was Destroyed; But the Traitors Still Suppress the Peasants</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: The Kunshan puppet county government has long coveted the enormous amount of over one million in taxes from the entire county. But since the opening of the collection counter last year, the income has been very small. Recently, on the proposal of Xie Anbo, the director of the puppet tax office, a large number of puppet officials were sent to various villages to urge the collection, in the hope of increasing revenue. Ma Ziliang, the puppet tax director of Jia Hong, is a local rogue and a disciple of Lu Ruifu, the chief tax collector of the puppet tax office. He held an important position in the tax office before the war. This time, he was appointed as the director of the puppet tax office in Chajiahama, and he is in fact Xie's henchman. After Lu arrived in Cha, he forced the collection of taxes and desperately urged the collection. Whenever villagers were unwilling to pay taxes, he ordered the puppet police to arrest them, acting lawlessly and recklessly. Under this tyranny, the general weak villagers dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. However, the more severe the oppression, the stronger the resistance. A few days ago, Jin A'mei, Jin Bingsheng, and other villagers near Zhen gathered more than 300 villagers and destroyed the puppet tax office and the puppet self-defense group. All the puppet officials and puppet self-defense team members fled in all directions. After the villagers achieved their goal, they then drove the puppet Baozhang Yu to the scene of the incident and set fire to the house of Fang Ya, who initiated the rent resistance. Because the puppet Baozhang acted as a tiger's paw, helping the puppet office to urge the collection, he deserved to be punished. Later, the puppet director Ma Ziliang rushed to report to the puppet chief collection office and dispatched more than 100 puppet police officers to arrest Jin Bingsheng, Jin A'mei, etc., and tortured them cruelly. It is heard that the two have been secretly executed recently, but the peasants are still firmly resisting the payment of taxes.</p>
<h3>Lingdong Church Appeals to the United States to Ban the Shipment of Munitions and Gasoline to Japan</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese air force indiscriminately bombs churches, hospitals, and schools, and even forcibly occupies the charitable and educational institutions run by the American Baptist Church in China. The business that Americans have painstakingly operated in various parts of China for nearly a hundred years has almost vanished. The Lingdong Baptist Church has sent letters to the American General Assembly reporting the actual situation and requested the US government to prohibit arms dealers from selling munitions and gasoline to the aggressors. Recently, the Lingdong Baptist Church has received a reply from Dr. Howard of the General Assembly, stating that he has notified all church pastors and members in the United States to urge the US government to effectively implement the ban on the transportation of munitions to Japan. The churches here are very pleased to hear the great sympathy from all over America. Because the planes, bombs, and gasoline used by the Japanese air force are mostly purchased from American arms dealers. If strictly prohibited, disasters in the interior of China can be reduced, and the future of world peace will also benefit a lot.</p>
<p>There are 72 foreign households here, with 136 men and women, all of whom sympathize with China's resistance to Japan. Unless absolutely necessary, they will not leave the country. Among the foreigners, the British account for the most, with 58 British men and 10 women, 16 American men and 11 women, 9 German men and 2 women, 7 French men and 4 women, 1 Russian man and 2 women, 3 Dutch men and 1 woman, 2 Norwegian men, 3 Swiss men and 1 woman, and 1 Portuguese man. The foreigners here are able to live and work in peace.</p>
<h3>Golden Gate International Exposition Opens in San Francisco; President Roosevelt's Speech: Upholding Democracy, Criticizing Dictatorship, Promoting Good Neighborliness and American Security; Besides Resisting Aggression, He Abhors Resorting to Force</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) President Roosevelt delivered a radio address today at the opening ceremony of the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, criticizing dictatorial systems, saying that the American countries have established a model of international unity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance, which can revive trust in the hearts of the worried and uneasy, and can elevate democracy far above dictatorial cruelty. The US President then issued a radio address at the opening ceremony of another venue in Tampa, Florida, expounding the US foreign policy, saying that we want to promote the freedom of trade and travel, and the exchange of human cultural life by various legal means. We do not want to expand our land, nor do we covet our neighbors. We are willing to cooperate with anyone who faithfully proposes any suggestions for disarmament. Besides dealing with aggression, we abhor resorting to force. However, we must tell the world that the democratic government system in the Western Hemisphere, which has the consent of the governed, must be maintained. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) At 8:00 AM this morning, as soon as the gates of the Golden Gate International Exposition opened, thousands of people rushed in to participate in the exhibition. A total of thirty-six countries participated in the exhibition. China was absent due to military difficulties. The "Treasure Island" where the venue is located will be converted into a Pacific aviation base in the future. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Receiving Ominous Intelligence From Overseas; The US President Worries About the European Situation; It Is Said That the Totalitarian Countries Will Use Terror Tactics; Or Will Shorten the Period of Naval Review</h3>
<p>(New York) It is heard from official circles that President Roosevelt will shorten his period of naval review because he has received reports on overseas developments. It is rumored that the totalitarian countries may use aggressive terror tactics instead of the usual diplomatic methods in order to make further demands. When President Roosevelt met with reporters on the way to Key West, he said that because the international situation is unsettling, he may return to Washington before March 3rd or 4th. From this, it can be seen that President Roosevelt had already indicated that he might have to return to the capital early. As for the nature of the reports received by President Roosevelt, it has not yet been announced. However, according to what United Press International has heard, overseas developments are quite possible, not just something that may happen. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is rumored that President Roosevelt received intelligence about developments in Europe, so he will reduce the period of the naval review and return to the capital early. Key figures in Congress said that they did not know whether President Roosevelt had received intelligence. The State Department was relatively inactive, but it was said that President Roosevelt may have exchanged phone calls with the ambassadors to Britain and France, and thus obtained special intelligence. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The meaning of "ominous news from overseas" mentioned by President Roosevelt when he met with reporters in Key West is unclear to the world. London is paying close attention to the news that President Roosevelt is going to Key West to observe the US naval maneuvers and may return to Washington early. However, political circles do not know the details of what special intelligence President Roosevelt received that caused him to make this statement. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Newspapers Ridicule and Criticize</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Since US President Roosevelt issued a mysterious report, saying that because he had received disturbing news about the European situation, he might shorten the period of visiting the naval exercises and return to Washington early, the "Berlin Evening News" here recently responded, saying, "The European situation here is as usual, we have not found any new serious developments." "It is also heard that various American news agencies telegraphed their European branches from New York, inquiring about the source of the news, but so far, there is no sign of a crisis in Europe." The newspaper said, "Why should President Roosevelt be so worried about Europe? In fact, Europe has nothing to do with Roosevelt, and he does not need to bother his mind and worry about it." (Haitong, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) All the newspapers here published President Roosevelt's remarks that he might shorten his trip. A political observer said that if the US president really made the statement that he might have to change his plan due to ominous overseas intelligence, then he was just playing a drama. According to non-official sources, people chatting in clubs now hold the view that there will be developments soon, and that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will be the first to act after the election of the new pope. An editorial in the Stampa newspaper said that there is a growing impression that the two Anglo-Saxon nations have decided to use strong methods and have a disapproving attitude towards the totalitarian countries.

<h3>Japanese, German, and Italian Aggressive Ambitions; Pittman Launches a Major Attack; Saying Nurturing Them Will Lead to Trouble</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a radio address this afternoon, attacking the totalitarian countries with very strong language. He said, in brief, that the totalitarian countries all want to dominate the world, and the American people are prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend the ideals they believe in. "Because the American people cherish these ideals so deeply, they value them even more than their lives." "If all our countrymen sincerely want to prevent the United States from being dragged into the vortex of war again, then the only way is to promote an active policy, that is, to use powerful means to safeguard its interests in the 'whole world.' The so-called appeasement policy, 'not only nurtures trouble, but also violates morality.'" "Life is only a few decades, and death is only once. Rather than enduring humiliation and lingering on, it is better to sacrifice for the ideals they cherish. In other words, even if it means dying a few days earlier for Christian dogma, justice, and freedom, it is worth it." After such an impassioned speech, Pittman went on to directly attack the head of state, Hitler, saying, in brief, "Hitler's eastward policy was originally intended to occupy the Ukrainian region to reach Siberia. If anyone suspects that I am exaggerating, please read Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf' and they will suddenly understand. As for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, we will not criticize him for the time being, although there are things that must be exposed, that is, he has completely militarized Italy and has a strong force at his command, and because of the international situation, it has evolved into the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis. As for Japan, its ambition lies in dominating the Asian continent and the Pacific islands. Combining the goals of these three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, is to prepare to control Latin America. As far as the current situation is concerned, the intrusion of these countries into Latin America is not a major issue, because if Germany and Italy can control Europe, and Japan can control Asia, then they can proceed to plot Latin America. It is far away from now, but the situation is like this, and the signs are obvious, so we should prevent it as early as possible. Who says it is not appropriate?" The saying goes, "Prepare for a rainy day, be prepared for trouble." This is what all rational people must feel the same way. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Discusses the Japanese Army: Laborious But Ineffective</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian stated that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the initiative has always been in the hands of the Japanese army. Now, for the first time, it has shifted to the Chinese army. Since the successive fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, the Japanese army has been in a laborious but ineffective state. The soldiers are tired and frustrated, and the officers are confused and at a loss. People may think that now is the time for the Chinese people to work together, but in reality it is not necessarily so, because the territory is too vast and the transportation is inconvenient. Chinese soldiers can match Japanese soldiers, but the officers are inferior. China's greatest hope lies in the organization of large-scale guerrilla warfare, and, when necessary, the arming of farmers and villagers. The guerrilla movement will spread further in the future, and the Japanese will not be able to stop it. A year later, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army may gladly accept any peace conditions that can be secured. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement; Chairman Chiang's Radio Address: Past Work Suited the Needs of the War of Resistance; Should Work Harder to Rebuild the Spirit of National Construction</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Amid the celebrations of the Lunar New Year by the residents of Chongqing, government agencies, due to the national crisis, continue to work as usual despite the holidays. This year's Lunar New Year's Day happens to be the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang gave a speech on the great significance of this movement on the radio last night. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang broadcasted a speech on the 18th for the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. The full text is recorded below.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen across the country, today is the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. We will thoroughly review the achievements of the New Life Movement in the past five years, and compare them with the situation of the country and the nation in the past five years. First, we feel that the five years have passed very quickly, but our efforts for the cause of restoration have not really reached the level we expected. The spirit of our compatriots is still not fully invigorated, and we have not achieved the point where everyone can do their best and fulfill their duties. But at the same time, we also feel that the seeds sown five years ago have after all produced considerable results. Due to the awakening of the New Life Movement, the inherent moral spirit of our nation has shown enthusiastic and strong manifestations at any time and any place during the year and a half of the War of Resistance. Our country, up and down, has been encouraged by all kinds of facts, has adhered to the national self-confidence, and has embarked on the road of national construction and restoration. Both the spirit and the cause have shown that they are progressing step by step. In particular, we feel that in the War of Resistance, due to the changes in the national life and the contact with the wartime environment, the various lifestyle changes that the New Life Movement wants to achieve, such as speed, certainty, simplicity, and neatness, can mostly be achieved smoothly without prompting.</p>
<p>The general public has been tempered from reality and learned from action, and has realized the true meaning and value of the New Life Movement. Therefore, we can promote the New Life Movement in the future with half the effort. We can use the power of propaganda from the past in words and texts to promote practical actions. In a nutshell, we should base ourselves on the existing achievements, expand the scope of efforts, follow the trend of the natural evolution of the national spirit, and lay the foundation for the bright, progressive, and modern life of our nation in this extraordinary period of the War of Resistance and National Construction. In the past year, the work launched by the New Life Movement Headquarters, such as organizing battlefield service groups, consoling wounded soldiers and front-line soldiers, improving the lives of strong young men, advocating thrifty movements, and launching student summer rural service, have all been suitable for the needs of the War of Resistance, and have also been warmly supported by the compatriots. The women compatriots, under the organization of the New Life Movement, enthusiastically participated in work related to the War of Resistance, which is a further sign of the mobilization of the whole people. These achievements are not easy to obtain in peacetime, but if the preliminary foundation was not established before the war, there would not have been such gains. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Shooting of Japanese People; Not Related to Politics; The Shooter Seems to Be Korean; The Motive Is Likely Jealousy</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's special news this morning) Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from a certain Western newspaper asked a senior officer of the Public Concession Police Department about the shooting of three Japanese people in front of the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road on Sunday, which injured a Japanese woman, what was the motive of the case? According to the officer, the case does not have any political nature. According to other sources, the shooter seems to be a Korean. Even the driver of the car that the Japanese people were riding in at the time said in his testimony to the police that he thought the shooter was a Japanese or a Korean. According to very reliable speculation, the injured person is a dancer who speaks English very fluently. Judging from the circumstances, the shooting must have been out of jealousy of a former lover of the dancer. It is also remembered that at a meeting of the Japanese newspaper industry in the city on Sunday evening, when a reporter mentioned the woman's profession, the chairman of the meeting immediately said, "We don't need to listen to this anymore. According to the investigation by the Japanese military police, someone is trying to distort the facts, so there is no need to finish the question." From this point of view, the truth of the case can also be understood.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Side Employs Coercive Tactics Again, Planning to Exert Pressure on the Concessions, Even Claiming They Will Disregard Treaties, the Concession Authorities Must Devise Appropriate Measures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st, Reuter - According to today's Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese military conference held in Shanghai has decided to use force when necessary to eliminate anti-Japanese terrorists in the Public Concession. Tokyo, 21st, Reuter - Minseito party member Oyama, during a meeting of the House of Representatives today, raised an urgent question regarding the situation in Shanghai, and expressed condolences for the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Reformed Government" Foreign Minister, in the Japanese-occupied area on the evening of February 19. Oyama's questions included the following:</p>
<p>(1) Does the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council lack the ability to maintain order, or does it have the ability but lack the sincerity to do so? (2) Is there any indication that the assassins from the Chinese government are colluding with the Municipal Council authorities? (3) If treaties and laws cause hesitation, can the right of self-defense override all treaties, and does the Japanese side intend to exercise this right of self-defense? (4) Does the Japanese side intend to expand the cleansing operations to the Public Concession and the French Concession? In his reply, Prime Minister Hiranuma stated that the Shanghai Public Concession, which has always been considered a safe area by the general public,</p>
<p>has repeatedly experienced terrorist demonstrations, which has begun to give the impression that the Concession is merely a base for the terrorist activities of lawless elements. If this is the case, the issue of taking measures to safeguard peace and order in China must be fundamentally reconsidered. We cannot ignore the secret activities of the Chinese government and the Communist Party in the Concession. The government has instructed the local authorities to take appropriate and effective measures. In summary, nothing can prevent the exercise of the right of self-defense. Foreign Minister Arita then declared that the government is</p>
<p>closely monitoring the development of the situation within the Shanghai Public Concession. Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, had already requested the Public and French Concession authorities on February 10 to severely deal with illegal and radical elements. If the situation does not improve, fundamental measures must be taken to safeguard law and order. Naval Minister Yonai stated that regarding the future maintenance of peace in the Shanghai Public Concession, it is necessary to implement a thorough reform. He is very willing to take</p>
<p>the most effective measures. Yonai expressed his personal opinion that the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council lacks sincerity. If this continues, he believes it is necessary to take effective self-defense measures. According to Japanese sources, both the Minseito and Seiyukai parties are extremely concerned about the continuous emergence of terrorist incidents in Shanghai. It is said that the Diet supports the use of force to suppress terrorists in the Public Concession. Japanese newspapers have expressed great indignation towards the situation in Shanghai. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun strongly urges the "Reformed Government" and the Japanese government to</p>
<p>exercise the right of self-defense to crack down on illegal elements in the two Shanghai Concessions, saying that these elements are engaging in terrorist demonstrations exclusively against Japanese and pro-Japanese Chinese, without being punished. The newspaper also lamented the death of Chen Lu at this time, and expressed the Japanese people's anger at the Public Concession authorities' inability to control illegal elements. It also stated that when the two Concession authorities receive Japanese protests, they invariably respond with prepared answers, but fail to implement effective methods to curb terrorist activities. Although the two Concession authorities have made every effort to protect the people of the Third Party, they pay little attention to</p>
<p>the dangers faced by the Chinese and Japanese. The same situation exists in the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. The factions of the Chinese government and the Communist Party are now engaged in activities against Japan and the new Chinese regime, without being punished. Their bases are located in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, and the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. The new Chinese regime and the Japanese government should exercise their right of self-defense because the Public Concession and the French Concession authorities cannot protect the lives of the Chinese and Japanese, and have lost their defensive capabilities. The Asahi Shimbun also</p>
<p>expressed a similar view, stating that more than twenty terrorist cases have occurred in the two Shanghai Concessions, and not a single perpetrator has been brought to justice, which is extremely regrettable. The two Concession authorities lack the ability to restrain illegal elements or prevent their secret activities, and their actions of colluding with these people in an attempt to aid the Chinese government have now been criticized. According to the Japanese side, their protest letter to Fessenden, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, had long anticipated the occurrence of the current terrorist cases. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Shanghai Japanese authorities have decided to take steps to deal with this shocking situation. The Japanese government should take stringent measures to eliminate anti-Japanese terrorists in the two Shanghai Concessions.</p>
<h3>Investigation into Salary Increases Report Accepted by Municipal Council, To Be Implemented from March 1st, Salaries of Heads of Departments Reduced Accordingly</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Municipal Council held a special meeting yesterday (20th) at noon to discuss the report made by the special committee of business representatives investigating salary increases within the bureau. It was subsequently resolved to accept the report, and it was announced that the points listed in the report would be implemented from March 1st. Regarding this, the Municipal Council's announcement stated that the bureau intended to</p>
<p>implement the committee's report as soon as possible, and that the relevant heads and deputy heads readily agreed without waiting for notification. Therefore, the changes recommended by the special committee will be implemented from March 1st. The salary increases given to the heads of departments by the Municipal Council this year will be gradually reduced, with the exception of Philip, the Chief Secretary, whose salary of 2,500 yuan remains unchanged, as Mr. Philip</p>
<p>also holds the position of Commissioner-General. As for the salaries of other department heads, they will all be gradually reduced, with a minimum reduction of 900 yuan and a maximum of 1,300 yuan. For example, a certain department head who received a basic salary of 2,250 yuan in December last year and 4,392 yuan in January will receive 3,057 yuan according to the new plan set by the special committee. The special committee's recommendations regarding the salary increases for</p>
<p>foreign and Chinese staff employed by the Municipal Council in Shanghai with employment contracts have not been changed. At the same time, the committee's recommendation regarding the bureau's regulation that retirement pensions are only calculated based on basic salary has also not been changed. According to the Municipal Council's salary increase plan, the estimated annual</p>
<p>increase in expenditure would be 700,720 yuan, while according to the committee's recommendations, the annual increase in expenditure would be 720,600 yuan, which is nearly 20,000 yuan more than the bureau's plan, because the basic salaries of other foreign employees will be increased by 15% according to the committee's recommendations.</p>
<h3>Gunfight Occurs at Haimen in Eastern Zhejiang, Chinese Troops Valiantly Retaliate, Haimen Suffers No Losses, Population Evacuated, Jiaojiang Completely Blockaded, Shanghai-Taizhou Navigation Severed</h3>
<p>Since Japanese warships concentrated in the Hezhou Bay, attempting to land, they have been shelling Haimen since February 18th. The Chinese troops retaliated. Haimen has suffered no losses. Order is very good. The evacuation of the population has been completed, and important defense works have been built. Shanghai-Taizhou shipping has been forced to stop, while Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes are operating as usual. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of the Battle of Taizhou Bay</p>
<p>In the Taizhou Bay area of eastern Zhejiang, after Japanese warships concentrated in an attempt to land, on February 18th, two Japanese warships approached the blockade line and dispatched four small boats carrying more than a hundred naval personnel, attempting to land at the Haimen pier. At that time, the Japanese warships first shelled Haimen, and our local garrison immediately retaliated, and waited for the Japanese small boats to approach the pier before opening fire to stop them. The Japanese navy, seeing that the shore was heavily guarded, immediately fled back to the Japanese warships. The gunfight lasted for about two hours before stopping. There was no gunfight all day on the 19th. From 6:00 AM on the 20th, two Japanese warships outside the blockade line suddenly opened fire, and the gunfight between the two sides stopped at 9:00 AM. On the morning of the 21st, Japanese bombers flew to Taizhou, but did not drop bombs. The Japanese warships did not move.</p>
<p>The Jiaojiang Blockade is Completely Deployed</p>
<p>A New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese warships</p>
<p>in Taizhou Bay (i.e., Jiaojiang) shelled Haimen, with the shells landing in the "North Bank" villages of Haimen. We suffered no losses, only destroying a few civilian houses, and there were no deaths or injuries. As for the population in Haimen city, the authorities have completed the evacuation, so order is very good. However, heavy troops are stationed on both sides of Haimen and Jiaojiang, and the defense works have been completed and are very solid. The blockade line has been completely blockaded, prohibiting all ships from entering or leaving. The buoys of the anchored ships outside the blockade line have been automatically destroyed. Defensive items such as mines have been placed within the blockade line. If the Japanese army attempts to land, the local garrison is determined to strike hard.</p>
<p>Six Japanese Warships off the Coast of Zhejiang</p>
<p>Due to the war in the Taizhou area and the blockade of Jiaojiang, the Shanghai-Taizhou route has been completely cut off since February 18th. The last ship to leave Haimen was the Shantai of the Portuguese company, Zhengde. The British company Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng arrived in Shanghai from Haifang, passing through the waters outside the mouth of Taizhou Bay, and saw six Japanese warships. However, the weather in the area was extremely bad, and the Japanese army's attempt to land would inevitably be greatly affected. In addition, the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo routes are still open. The Portuguese company, Merrill's Meda, sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. The Portuguese company, Zhengde's Shantai, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo tomorrow. The Italian company, Yihua Shipping's Baoli, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. The American company, Huamei's Tanglu, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 26th.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Once Shelled Dinghai</p>
<p>Dinghai (i.e., Zhoushan) was once landed on by Japanese warships in the past. After the gunfight in Haimen, the situation in Dinghai has become tense again, prohibiting all ships from docking at Dinghai. Local militias and police are stationed, and martial law is declared. At 11:00 AM on February 18th, three Japanese warships sailed to Dinghai and fired more than a dozen shells towards the head of Zhushan Gate before fleeing. However, the local police and militia did not retaliate. The shells all landed in the wilderness, so there were no losses. Although the situation on the island is tense now, the local area is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Protests to Municipal Council Regarding Terrorist Incidents, In Addition to Verbal Statements, He Will Also Submit Written Material, Municipal Council Maintains Security Based on Its Previous Position</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, previously blamed the Concession authorities for failing to take strict precautions against the repeated occurrence of "terrorist incidents," and once visited Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, to make verbal representations. The Concession authorities then clarified their position, pointing out that the occurrence of "terrorist incidents" mostly occurred outside the Concession's jurisdiction, and that the Japanese side's failure to completely return police powers to the Concession was the main reason. Therefore, it was believed that the representations made by the Japanese side were not entirely consistent with the facts. However, recently, during the Lunar New Year period, cases of traitors being killed have continued to occur, and the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet "Reformed Government," and the wounding of two Japanese people in front of Guanshengyuan, have made the Japanese and puppet sides even more uneasy. Therefore, Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, visited Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, for the second time on the afternoon of the previous day (20th) to make another verbal warning. The Japanese Consul General believes that the continuous occurrence of these "terrorist incidents" is the complete responsibility of the Concession authorities for failing to take serious measures. It was decided that the above demands would be submitted in writing. He then took his leave. It is now heard that the Municipal Council has decided to maintain its previous position and implement the spirit of cooperation among police personnel to deal with everything. The so-called written notice from Japan has not yet been delivered as of last night.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, visited Fessenden, Chairman of the Municipal Council, yesterday (20th) afternoon and made a verbal protest regarding the "recent continuous occurrence of violence." According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, speaking to reporters last night, Miura told Fessenden that the Japanese authorities were seriously observing the recent continuous occurrence of violence in the Public Concession, and that the Municipal Council must bear full responsibility for these acts of violence. The spokesman's official statement ended by saying that Miura reserved the right to make a written detailed report on these unexpected events. In response to questions, the spokesman said that in his position, he could not say whether the Japanese authorities would deploy armed patrols on Nanjing Road. Regarding the rumor from a Shanghai correspondent of a certain Tokyo newspaper that the Japanese authorities are currently considering taking direct action in the Public Concession and searching suspicious locations, in his position, he could not say whether it was true. A reporter asked whether the Police Department had asked the Japanese authorities to notify the Police Department if any Japanese groups wanted to enter the Public Concession, especially during</p>
<p>Chinese holidays and festivals. The spokesman replied, "We have not received this information, so we do not know about it." A reporter asked whether Chen Lu, a puppet official of the Nanjing puppet regime, notified the Public Concession Police Department when he arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, the day before he was fatally wounded in an assassination attempt at his residence on YuYuan Road. The spokesman was also unable to answer. According to inquiries last night,</p>
<p>Chen did not notify the Police Department when he came to Shanghai, and it is believed that Mr. Chen was unaware that the Police Department had made this request. It was also confirmed last night by a senior official of the Police Department that the Public Concession authorities had asked the Japanese authorities to notify the Police Department when Japanese groups wanted to enter the south bank of Suzhou Creek. The Public Concession authorities had made this request to the Japanese authorities repeatedly, but the Japanese side did not respond. According to a Domei News Agency report, yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Continental News Extra edition stated that</p>
<p>the Japanese expatriates in Shanghai were quite indignant about the sniper attack on four Japanese people on Nanjing Road and the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet Nanjing government. They are currently demanding that the Japanese military authorities take action by force in the Public Concession. The Japanese expatriates also plan to hold a mass meeting to urge the Japanese authorities to take drastic action to deal with the terrorist incidents. The Japanese expatriates are even more indignant because "innocent and defenseless women," namely two Japanese female dancers, were also subjected to the terror of the sniper attacks.</p>
<h3>Refugees Request to Return Home for Spring Planting, Shanghai International Relief Committee Dispatches Father Ba, etc., to Plan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee has achieved considerable success in its relief work for refugees since its establishment after the "August 13th" incident. It has been found that the three shelters, namely the First Shelter on Masnan Road, the Second Shelter on West Ames Road, and the Sixth Shelter on North Henan Road, house a total of nearly ten thousand refugees. Pan Da, Feng Shiguang, and Guan Ganzhong are responsible for managing the shelters, supervising the entire staff of the three shelters, and constantly working hard without sparing any effort. Therefore, the education and production work of the refugees in these three shelters are outstanding, and they serve as models for refugee shelters in Shanghai. It is learned that the International Relief Committee, in order to further promote refugee production, is not only establishing various production works in the shelters, but also paying close attention to refugees returning to their hometowns for spring planting. Moreover, many refugees in the refugee shelters under the committee have recently requested assistance to return to their hometowns for spring planting. Therefore, the 35th Standing Committee meeting of the committee decided to dispatch Maris, Li Guiyong, and Father Ba to form a committee (and authorize the addition of members) to formulate measures and estimate the food and travel expenses for refugees on the way, in order to provide assistance for them to return home.</p>

<h3>Li Guojie Assassinated Yesterday, Li Walking with Friend on Xin Zha Road, Suddenly Shot Dead by a Strong Man with Four Shots</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, Zi Weihou, from Hefei, Anhui Province, was the eldest grandson of the late Qing Dynasty Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang. He was 60 years old and lived at No. 1030 Qinyuan Village, Xin Zha Road, Public Concession. In 1931, Li served as the manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but Li was by nature muddleheaded and fond of corruption. During his tenure, not only did he fail to achieve anything, but he dared to collude with his associates to steal and sell state assets, mortgaging the four wharves with a value of as much as 30 million yuan, thereby losing national sovereignty. His crimes were heinous. After the case was exposed by the National Government to the ministry, Li was transferred to the court. After repeated trials, it was determined that Li's scandalous record was obvious and he could not escape.</p>
<p>He was brought to justice and sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for five years. At that time, all sectors of society paid close attention to this case and unanimously condemned him, and the newspapers also carried detailed reports, which readers, if not forgetful, should be able to recall one or two things. After Li was released from prison, he moved his residence from No. 1005 Xiafei Road to his current residence. However, his actions still did not show any self-reflection. He liked to associate with unscrupulous people. After the National Army withdrew to the west, the general villains ignored national interests and shamelessly served the outside. When the puppet "Reformed Government" puppets took the stage, it was rumored that Li was also among them,</p>
<p>itching to move and thinking of plotting for the position of puppet "Minister of Industry," but it ultimately failed. However, Li's close relationship with the puppet organization puppets has not been interrupted. At about 4:05 PM yesterday, it was learned that Li was walking out of his friend's place and walking along Xin Zha Road with his friend, talking and walking. When they reached the intersection of Gordon Road, a strong man suddenly jumped out from the roadside, drew a box gun, and fired four or five shots at Li in succession. Li Guojie was hit by four shots in the body, one in the left eyebrow, one in the waist, one in the abdomen, and one in the leg. He immediately</p>
<p>fell to the ground. Blood flowed like a river. The strong man, seeing that his goal had been achieved, left calmly and disappeared. By the time the police arrived after hearing the alarm, Li was already barely breathing and his life was hanging by a thread. So they summoned an ambulance and sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but because the injuries were in vital parts, he died at 5 PM. The police are now investigating.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Various Industries Determines Method for Proving Goods Transportation, Guaranteed by Guild, Certificate Issued by Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Commerce Notifies Chamber of Commerce at the Place of Origin After Issuing Certificate</h3>

<h3>The Japanese and Puppets Advocate Ceasefire, Establish "China Revival Society," and Issue Absurd Declaration</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese invasion of China, its domestic finances have tended to collapse. The people and the army are extremely afraid of our long-term war of resistance, and war-weariness is growing daily. Therefore, the Japanese are in a hurry, and have colluded with Wang Jingwei to advocate peace negotiations, which have been unanimously condemned by the Chinese people and have failed. Later, they created an atmosphere, hoping that Wu Peifu would call for peace, but Wu firmly rejected them. Recently, the Japanese have instigated the puppets of the puppet "Reformed Government" to form the "China Revival Society" to engage in advocating a ceasefire and advocating pro-Japanese anti-communism. They issued a declaration on the 19th, the content of which was absurd and ridiculous, and all who saw it sneered.</p>
<h3>All Agencies Purchasing Foreign Goods Should Entrust to the Trust Bureau, Now in a Period of Controlled Foreign Exchange, Private Firms May Not Purchase on Behalf</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a public letter Yuku Zi No. 5614 on January 9, 1939, to various agencies, stating: "It is found that the Central Trust Bureau was established in accordance with the order of the National Government to engage in trust business. All government or public agencies purchasing goods and materials should entrust the bureau to handle them uniformly. In February of the 25th year, an order was issued by the Executive Yuan and then by the National Government for compliance. Now, in the period of long-term resistance against Japan and controlled foreign exchange, the purchase of various equipment from abroad should be entrusted to the bureau for overall planning and verification. In the future, if your department needs to order equipment and other items from abroad, please entrust the bureau to handle them in accordance with the case, and do not order from private firms, in order to comply with the law. In addition to sending letters separately, a corresponding letter is issued for reference and handling, and to transfer to subordinate agencies for compliance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai All Circles Share the Same Hatred of the Enemy, Leaders Express Gratification, and Hope to Contribute Funds and Devote Efforts to Greater Performance, Promote National Spirit and Assist</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang yesterday notified all important public groups in Shanghai that it had recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, stating, "The Shanghai Municipal Party Department and all groups that were transferred have been informed. Sharing the same hatred of the enemy, it has become more solid after a long time, and is very gratifying. Now the victory of the war of resistance is more assured. Shanghai is the focus of Chinese and foreign attention. I deeply hope that you will contribute funds and devote efforts to greater performance, so as to promote our national spirit and contribute to the effort. This is our earnest hope." Following this, the corresponding telegram letter was delivered, and it is hoped that you will refer to it. In the future, we also hope to encourage each other to work hard to support the war against the enemy, and live up to the earnest expectations of the leaders, which is the most important thing.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Local Goods Allowed to Be Exported, Shipping Active, Yongsheng Loaded with a Large Batch of Cotton, Moufu and Others All Went to Load Goods</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route was approved for direct shipping, the connection between the city and the mainland has become much more convenient. The goods transported from Shanghai are unobstructed. However, the export of goods from Ningbo is still restricted. The industries have sent telegrams requesting that local goods be allowed to be exported to facilitate regulation. It is now heard that a military agency has approved five types of local goods, namely tea, cotton, cotton yarn, local paper, and fresh eggs, to be temporarily allowed to be exported. It is also learned that the Yongsheng has been loaded with a large batch of cotton from Ningbo and will arrive in Shanghai today. Moufu of Jardine Matheson was originally planned to return to Shanghai on the Lunar New Year and then stop for repairs. Seeing that Ningbo local goods are allowed to be exported, and cargo transportation will be prosperous, the repairs have been postponed for two weeks and went to Ningbo the day before yesterday. Taikoo's New Beijing and Sino-Italian Deping sailed to Ningbo empty the day before yesterday to load cargo to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Commercial Association Accepts the Wuhai Bank Settlement Case, Appoints Executive Member Pei Lingqing, And Works with the Accountant</h3>
<p>Shanghai Minhang Wuhai Commercial Bank, due to the impact of the war, could not adapt to the receipt and payment, in accordance with Article 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, prepared a balance sheet, a property catalog, a list of creditors and debtors, a settlement plan, etc., and applied to the Shanghai Commercial Association for settlement. The Shanghai Commercial Association accepted it according to law, and appointed Executive Committee Member Pei Yunqing to preside over the handling together with accountant Wang Haifan, and sent a letter to the First Special District Local Court for review.</p>
<h3>Surge in Japanese Banknote Issuance, Meager Currency Reserves, Inflation Crisis Imminent, Yen Value Poised for Dramatic Fall</h3>
<p>According to a report in the *Continental Daily News*, citing a dispatch from the Domei News Agency, the Tokyo government has decided to increase the legal maximum limit for banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan from 5 billion yen to 2.7 billion yen. At the same time, the maximum limits for banknotes issued by banks in Japanese colonies will also be raised. The Bank of Chosen will expand from 60 million yen to 160 million yen, and the Bank of Taiwan will increase from 30 million yen to 80 million yen. Since the commencement of the</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese War,</p>
<p>the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan have been repeatedly increased through various means. The banknotes circulating in mainland Japan and its colonies have continuously increased, forcing the Tokyo government to repeatedly alter the laws and regulations governing the reserve requirements for banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan. In the last year before the war, i.e., 1936, the</p>
<p>Banknote Circulation</p>
<p>amounted to 1,865,760,000 yen. After two years of war, by the end of 1938, this amount had increased to 2,858,600,000 yen, an increase of several hundred million yen. During the same period, the banknotes issued by the Banks of Chosen and Taiwan also increased significantly. The total amount of banknotes issued in Japan and its colonies increased from 2,057,200,000 yen to 3,119,000,000 yen during the war, an increase of over 50 percent. This kind of</p>
<p>Japanese Banknote</p>
<p>circulation expansion is mainly due to the enormous expenditures incurred by the Tokyo government in its operations in China. To offset the ever-increasing amount of domestic war bonds, the Bank of Japan has had to increase its banknote issuance. However, the Japanese people have been unable to absorb these war bonds, which are still held by the Bank of Japan and the two aforementioned banks. According to the accounts published by the Bank of Japan, it can be seen that current</p>
<p>Government Deposits,</p>
<p>bank deposits, discounted securities, and advances on foreign bills of exchange all decreased in amount between 1937 and 1938. On the other hand, the Bank of Japan's holdings of government bonds increased from 829,073,000 yen to 1,841,407,000 yen, an increase of over 1 billion yen, or 125 percent. The increase in the Bank of Japan's holdings of government bonds is</p>
<p>perfectly consistent</p>
<p>with the increase in the banknotes issued by the bank.</p>
<p>The issuance of banknotes is sharply increased based on the new national debt issued in the form of public bonds and not digested, which is obviously called inflation. Not long ago, the use of the term "inflation" was forbidden in Japanese newspapers, but recently Japanese economic newspapers have been unable to deny the existence of inflation. "Oriental Economist," Japan's most reputable</p>
<p>economic publication,</p>
<p>stated in its February issue, "From this, it can be concluded that Japan is currently undergoing a period of evident inflation, so the government and the people must strive to curb the inflationary movement." Japanese newspapers are trying to refine the theories of the financial world, beginning to discuss two different types of inflation, as the Japanese call them:</p>
<p>Harmful Inflation</p>
<p>and Harmless Inflation. Of course, Japanese newspapers claim that what is happening in Japan today is harmless inflation and that this type of inflation does not have the disadvantages that are usually associated with harmful inflation. Of course, this is pure nonsense. Inflation is inflation and has nothing to do with logic. In short, the extreme meagerness of Japan's currency reserve stands in stark contrast to Japan's excessive military spending. Raising the</p>
<p>maximum limit</p>
<p>for banknote issuance is, in other words, reducing the gold reserve backing for banknote issuance. At the beginning of this war, Japan's gold reserve was 49 percent. Early last year, it was reduced to 40 percent, and at the end of last year, it was reduced to only 20 percent, before slightly increasing to 24 percent. This means that since the outbreak of hostilities, Japan's gold standard has been reduced by half. The inevitable result of all this is that the value of the yen will continue to fall sharply.</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily News*, British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who had been visiting North China and meeting with British officials and businessmen in Tianjin, Beijing and Qingdao, returned to Shanghai aboard the British warship HMS *Bee* at 11:00 AM on Sunday (the 19th). The Royal Navy's 10,000-ton cruiser HMS *Dorsetshire* also arrived in Shanghai at the same time as HMS *Bee*, docking at the British naval pontoon, replacing the British warship HMS *Cardiff*, which had been stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Kuling Foreign Residents to Descend the Mountain Today; First Batch Totals 45, With 20 More to Remain Temporarily</h3>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily News*, the local U.S. naval authorities received a final message from Kuling yesterday (the 20th) stating that 45 foreign residents of the mountain were scheduled to descend the mountain tomorrow (the 22nd), meaning that 20 foreign residents would remain in Kuling. As of yet, no information has been received regarding these 20 people. With the foreign residents scheduled to descend the mountain tomorrow, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday that the Japanese authorities have agreed to further extend the deadline again. If they</p>
<p>cannot descend the mountain</p>
<p>tomorrow, they will have to wait until February 25 to depart. Of the 45 foreign residents, nine are American. The exact number of people of other nationalities was not known as of yesterday. Of the 20 foreign residents remaining on the mountain, nine or ten are American. Commander Jaffe of the U.S. warship USS *Wake*, and Commander Stanford of the British warship HMS *Gnat*, who ascended the mountain three days ago,</p>
<p>returned to base</p>
<p>on Sunday afternoon. They are scheduled to re-ascend the mountain yesterday to make final preparations for the 45 foreign residents and assist in their descent. It is reported that they will travel to Shanghai aboard the *Wake* and the *Gnat*. Otherwise, the two gunboats will dock in Jiujiang, and after the foreign residents arrive, they will be transferred to a Japanese warship and transported to Shanghai. The summary closing period of 1938 saw Shanghai industries safely navigate the year-end due to the stable financial market and the distorted development of industry and commerce in the post-war concessions. Companies, firms, factories had started the year's business yesterday, while most had to wait until after today (the fourth day of the first lunar month) to resume operation. Members of the Money Trade Association and the Money Exchange Association, including money shops such as Hui Hua, Yuan Heng Li Zhen, and Fu Lu Shou Xi, have started reporting to the two associations, ready to start business tomorrow. Both associations have scheduled annual meetings to discuss new business policies after listing. It is reported that the Money Trade Association will meet on March 3, while the Money Exchange Association will wait for the decision of the executive committee. New account books used by all industries after the year-end closing have been decided to uniformly affix stamps at 40 cents per book in accordance with the government's promulgated stamp tax law for extraordinary times. If old account books continue to be used, stamps will also be affixed at 40 cents per book to maintain national tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Sends Telegram to National Political Council, Vowing to Endeavor in National Resistance Based on President's Sincere Instructions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters, in response to a telegram from the National Political Council expressing sympathy for the people in the occupied areas, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, on behalf of the citizens, sent a return telegram to the Council, expressing its determination to endeavor in national resistance based on President's sincere instructions. The text is as follows: To Speaker Jiang, Deputy Speaker Zhang, and all Councilors of the Chongqing National Political Council: As the second phase of the War of Resistance begins, at a time when our final victory is in sight, your Council is convening in the new capital to deliberate on national affairs. The news has spread, and all within the seas are rejoicing. We are especially moved by your telegram of sympathy. Although the people of Shanghai are in enemy territory, living in the tiger's den, the more dangerous the situation, the more courageous we become, and the more bitter the hardship, the more steadfast our resolve. When flags are raised, our hearts think of the Han; when flags are changed, righteousness does not submit to Qin. With the fellowship of those in the same boat, we contribute to alleviate the suffering of our local compatriots. With ardent patriotism, we donate funds to support the national treasury. Although the government cannot exercise its functions, the people obey national laws and accept the leadership of our Party, consistently from beginning to end. In the future, we vow to endeavor in the national resistance to the end, based on the President's sincere and pure instructions. Though Chu has only three households, Chu will surely destroy Qin. The people of Shanghai wish to encourage themselves in this way. Respectfully replying by telegram, we await your instructions. Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, leading various public organizations and citizens of the city, respectfully bows and presses its seal.</p>
<h3>Italian Steamer Arrives in Shanghai This Morning, Carrying a Batch of Jewish Refugees: 841 Men, Women, and Children, Relief Society Prepared to Accommodate</h3>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily News*, the Italian steamer *Conte Verde* is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 22nd), carrying 841 refugees, men, women, and children, from Germany. At that time, the number of German Jewish immigrants in Shanghai will reach 3,500. The Shanghai European Jewish Refugee Relief Committee is</p>
<p>quite apprehensive</p>
<p>about these 800 newcomers, unlike with previous groups of refugees arriving in Shanghai, because the 532 men, 268 women, and 41 children can be housed in the single men's residence on Ward Road, the family residence on Huishan Road, or temporarily in the Riverside Mansion. Of the current group of refugees, 15 have already landed in Manila on February 15, according to the conditions of the Philippine government for admitting refugees, namely that the refugees can provide</p>
<p>adequate guarantees</p>
<p>that they will not burden the host country. The single men's residence on Ward Road can accommodate 1,000 single men, but currently only 200 are housed there, so there is ample room to accommodate the new single men. The committee has also acquired</p>
<p>a building</p>
<p>on Washington Avenue at its disposal, but has not yet decided how to use it. Judging from the current situation, the building will be converted into a hospital, run and managed exclusively by immigrants, to treat Jewish refugees and those who wish to seek medical treatment there.</p>
<h3>American Citizens in Hainan Island Safe; There are Ten American Citizens on the Entire Island</h3>
<p>According to the *Continental Daily News*, the American destroyer USS *Edwards* was recently ordered to Haikou to investigate the ten American citizens currently residing on Hainan Island. Yesterday (the 17th), the ship sent a message to Hong Kong, which was relayed to Shanghai, stating that all American citizens residing on Hainan Island were safe and remained in their residences. Seven of them reside in Haikou, while the other three reside in other parts of the island. Nine of them are missionaries, and the remaining one is a customs official of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. It is reported that the *Edwards* sailed from Hong Kong to the island to dock, so that it could evacuate the American citizens if necessary. According to a message sent by the ship's officers, they found the situation in Haikou to be peaceful and the American citizens to be in no danger. The American citizens residing elsewhere on the island were also safe. The property of the American citizens was also undamaged during the Japanese occupation. As there was no apparent need for the American citizens to evacuate, the</p>
<p>destroyer decided to return to Hong Kong to prepare for service along the Chinese coast.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Eagerly Provide Disaster Relief; Famous Performers Broadcast and Sing to Raise Funds; Donations from All Sectors Reach Over 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Philatelist Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Fundraising Committee, considering that people from all walks of life were spending the Lunar New Year, while tens of thousands of refugees were without food or clothing, shivering in the cold and crying from hunger, launched a fundraising effort for relief. Initiated by Yu Qiaqing, Jin Tingsun, and Yuan Ludeng, over 600 famous amateur and professional performers from all over Shanghai were invited to perform in a grand Peking opera broadcast at the Continental Radio Station of the Franco-Chinese Pharmacy on the first and second days of the Lunar New Year. All the amateur and professional performers enthusiastically participated, pleading for the lives of refugees throughout the city. Before the broadcast, Yu, Jin, and Yuan delivered speeches, followed by various exciting programs until 4:00 AM. Patrons from all walks of life were extremely enthusiastic in requesting songs, with the total proceeds for the two days reaching over 12,000 yuan. The fundraising committee is currently collecting the funds and preparing a report to submit to the association for use as relief funds.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee's Citizen One-Day Disaster Relief Movement Propaganda Conference opened at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Great Asia Radio Station.

It is scheduled to close at midnight tomorrow at the Continental Radio Station.</p>
<h3>Sijiao Sand Transport Resumes Original State; Over 20 Boats Carrying Over 600 Tons Arrive; Court Opens Second Hearing, Scheduled for Verdict</h3>
<p>After the Wantai Sand and Gravel Company monopolized sand transport for several days, in addition to the Sand and Gravel Association appealing for assistance from all sectors, over ten thousand sand transport workers also went on strike. Sijiao sand transport workers voluntarily petitioned Wang Pinrong, captain of the Sijiao guerrilla team, who approved the restoration of the original state. Yesterday, over 20 boats carrying about 600 tons of yellow sand from Sijiao, including those of Zhou Yeyong, Chuan Chunsheng, Wang Lingao, and Yu Dongming, unloaded their cargo at the New Garbage Bridge. As for the lawsuit filed by Jinximin Lawyer employed by Wantai against Fang Jinxiang and others for obstructing business, the Shanghai First Special District District Court held a hearing. A second hearing was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. Jinximin Lawyer appeared in court to defend Wantai. Defendants Fang Jinxiang, Liu Yongqing, and Xu Fuqing all appeared in person and hired Feng Meixue Lawyer to defend them. The result was a scheduled verdict on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Lumber Industry Almost Completely Lost; Estimated Loss of Over 17 Million; Mostly Seized and Sold at Low Prices</h3>
<p>The lumber businesses and plank shops opened by Chinese merchants, numbering over 20 in the Bund wharves and Gaoshanmiao area of Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi, with the largest scale being the Jufeng Lumber Business (opened at the New Wharf) established by Ma Jiliang, and the Xiangtai, Santai, Shuntai, Kaitai, Zhen Changtai, Jiu Ji Nan Zhan (on Jichang Street), Changtai, Zhengyu, Yongtai, and the Lin Ji Lumber Business (established on the Bansongyuan Bund) founded by Zhang Xiaolin. After the retreat of the National Army to the west, all the businesses fell into the war zone, and the Bund area was a Japanese defense zone, and citizens could not pass through. Except for the Huyu Chang Lumber Business, which managed to move out some of its goods early, the remaining 20 businesses, all the houses, properties, sawmill machines, various lumber, and expensive coffins, totaling an estimated value of over 17.7 million yuan, have now been seized by the Japanese and completely lost. To sell off the lumber, the Japanese instructed rogues to collude with the puppet organization to establish the "Nanshi Revival Lumber Stacking and Firewood Shed," and converted the former Penglai Road Experimental Elementary School into an office, soliciting business everywhere in order to turn the stolen goods into money, and forced carpenters to make various wooden items at low wages, which were transported by the puppet transport company to the concessions for sale. It is learned that recently, puppet police on Zhonghua Road on the inside roads of Nanshi have been using free cars to oppress residents, dragging dilapidated cars back and forth in a busy manner, with more than ten vehicles transporting various lumber. As for expensive coffins, which usually cost over 2,000 yuan, such as nanmu and sand-panel coffins, are now sold for only 100 yuan each. If they have a relationship with the puppet organization, they can be discounted by half.</p>
<h3>Trademark Exclusive Scope; Judicial Yuan Order Interpretation; Limited to Designation</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan previously had doubts about the scope of trademark exclusivity and consulted the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed the Trademark Bureau to investigate and follow up. The original text is recorded below.</p>

However, if only one type of goods in a certain category is designated at the time of registration, there is still doubt whether its exclusive right can extend to all goods in the entire category. Correspondingly, please investigate and reply for reference. To demonstrate public friendship, this consults the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs Order</p>
<p>Approved the Executive Yuan's order No. 9340 on November 14, 1938, stating: "This Yuan previously had doubts about the issue of trademark exclusivity and consulted the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. Now approved the Judicial Yuan's reply No. 1808 on November 7, 1938, stating: 'It has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this Yuan that a registered trademark has, in accordance with Article 25 of the Trademark Law, only designated its trademark for use on one type of goods in a certain category in the application, then its exclusivity naturally does not extend to the entire category. Correspondingly, reply for reference, etc.'." Approved this, a copy of the original consultation will be sent to the department. Please be informed, this order.

<h3>Flower Gambling Factory Receives Gift; A Bomb as a Gift; Warning from the Iron-Blooded Army</h3>
<p>The gambling atmosphere is rampant in the Robert Road area of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road, causing considerable harm. The most prominent of these is the Yiji Flower Gambling Factory at No. 20, Gongyi Lane. The den opens three times a day, extorting the people's fat and scraping the meager weight. In particular, ignorant women are most deeply victimized, and even those who lose their families are not uncommon. The factory is opened by the well-known gangsters Li Xiaobao and Mao Axiang. Because of their great evil power, the business is also considerable. The matter was known to the Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese Elimination Traitors Iron-Blooded Army, which hated its harm to people's livelihood, and then wanted to punish it. Then, on the 13th of this month, an uninvited guest was sent to warn. At that time, the person held a paper package, first greeted the guard at the entrance of the den, and said, "Here is a humble gift, please forward it to your master." After speaking, he handed the paper package to the guard, turned around and said goodbye. After they accepted it, they felt that the object was very heavy, knowing that things were not good, and then gathered many classmates and then chased out, intending to negotiate with the gift-giver, but they did not say that when they reached the entrance, they were pointed at by other strong men with guns. He had to send the original object back to Li and Mao's room. After dismantling and inspecting it, there was a bomb inside, and an enclosed warning letter from the "Chinese Youth Anti-Japanese Elimination Traitors Iron-Blooded Army". At that time, Li and others were afraid that the matter would be leaked, which would be related to business, so they secretly ordered the hired personnel to strictly prohibit disclosure, but the facts were obvious, so it was finally revealed to the outside world after four or five days.</p>

<h3>The Truth of the Yuchunchi Shooting Incident: Han Zhengyi Avenges His Cousin, Han's Gunshot Wound Not Yet Healed, Retrial Postponed</h3>
<p>Han Zhengyi (also known as Lu Youlin) from Zhenjiang, his cousin was recently reported to the Japanese Headquarters by a Zhou, accusing him of being a guerrilla. The Japanese arrested and shot him. Upon hearing this news, Han vowed to avenge his cousin. He secretly tracked Zhou's whereabouts. On the 3rd of this month, Han learned that Zhou was bathing at the Yuchunchi Bathhouse at No. 184 Hubei Road. He went there at 2:50 PM with a handgun, intending to assassinate Zhou. However, for some reason, he mistakenly identified the bather Pan Shirong as Zhou and fired a shot at him. The bullet missed Pan but injured the arm of Nie Rongxiang, a back scrubber standing nearby. Han immediately tried to escape with his gun. At that moment, Guo Shouxin, a Chinese detective from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, was also taking a bath. Seeing the situation, he immediately drew his gun and fired two shots at Han, both hitting him. Han was injured and fell to the ground. The detective seized his handgun and five bullets and sent both Han and Nie Rongxiang to the hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the police charged him with attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide opened the trial. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the circumstances and said that according to the doctor's report, Han's injuries prevented him from leaving the hospital, so he requested that the hearing be postponed until Han had recovered. The court verified and ordered the retrial to be postponed.</p>
<h3>Puppets Fear Death, Demand Protection</h3>
<p>The puppet "Reformed Government" sees its large and small puppet officials repeatedly targeted and killed, while Liang Hongzhi and his ilk, though protected by escorts, are timid as mice and fear that even with precautions, they could be assassinated. They have become increasingly fearful. Smaller puppet officials have also come forward to demand guarantees of their safety. Liang and others, finding themselves in a precarious situation, besieged both internally and externally, are at their wits' end. After a secret meeting, they agreed that while they could not guarantee the safety of puppet officials serving in the "institutions," they could provide compensation for their deaths. That is, they cannot be responsible for the safety of any puppet official, but should they be assassinated, a sum of "compensation" and living expenses for their families would be provided to express their condolences. At the end of the lunar year, they enacted a "Compensation Ordinance," stipulating that 100,000 yuan would be paid for the killing of a puppet "Special Appointee," 50,000 yuan for a "Senior Appointee," 30,000 yuan for a "Recommended Appointee," and 10,000 yuan for a "Commissioned Appointee" (with smaller sums for lower-ranking puppet officials, omitted for brevity). If there are children, the puppet "salary" will continue to be paid until they reach adulthood and are able to find employment. The puppet "Ordinance" has been sent to the Shanghai puppet "Municipal Government."</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization's "Minister of Foreign Affairs," Chen Lu Assassinated, Incident Occurred in the Chinese Area of the Western District, Public Concession Police Have Discovered Clues</h3>
<p>Reuters Chongqing, 20th - The Central Daily News editorial states that the assassination of Chen Lu is a Lunar New Year gift from the Chinese people of Shanghai to the soldiers on the front lines. Before Chen Lu, many other traitors have met the same fate. After Chen Lu, we should keep a close watch.</p>
<p>On the first day of the Lunar New Year (i.e., the 19th), many businesses in this city were closed, and the streets had a different atmosphere. Unexpectedly, a shocking assassination occurred on this day. The victim was Chen Lu (alias Renxian), the puppet "Reformed Government's Minister of Foreign Affairs," who had just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing last month. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai to Spend the New Year</p>
<p>Chen Lu's Shanghai residence was located at No. 25, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, in the western part of the city, in the area of extra-settlement roads, under the jurisdiction of Zhenning Road in the Chinese area. Chen arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 18th of the lunar calendar and immediately returned to his residence. Chen's comings and goings were usually heavily guarded. In addition to the many bodyguards hired at his Shanghai residence, he also carried guards to prevent accidents. Chen's trip to Shanghai was solely for the purpose of spending the New Year.</p>
<p>Gunfire and Assassination</p>
<p>At about 7 PM on the evening of the 19th, suddenly more than a dozen young men in long gowns, all armed with handguns and Mauser pistols, entered directly through the back door of Chen's residence. Two of them monitored Chen's hired bodyguards. Seeing the large number of attackers and the suddenness of the event, the bodyguards were unable to resist after being restrained. At that time, six or seven of the young men went straight into the living room of Chen's residence. Chen was sitting in the living room with his friend Luo and his family, chatting casually. They were surprised and about to ask who these unknown people were when the attackers fired two shots at Chen's head. One bullet exited from the neck, and the other severed the throat, passing through the throat. Then they fired five or six more shots in succession, and bullets pierced his right thigh. After being shot, Chen immediately fell to the ground bleeding, barely alive.</p>
<p>Not Punishing Wife and Children</p>
<p>At this time, Chen's friend and his wife and daughters were terrified by the scene. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the shooters immediately distributed a leaflet signed "China Youth Iron and Blood Army," which read "Resistance will win, nation-building will succeed, jointly eliminate traitors, and forever protect China." They also claimed that they were eliminating harm for the country and that their wives and children would not be punished. Then they left in different directions. It is reported that when these dozen or so people came and went to Chen's residence, because the area was an extra-settlement road area, their footprints did not touch a step of the Public Concession. After the incident, all parties tried their best to search, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Moving the Corpse for Burial</p>
<p>After Chen was shot, he was immediately taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. However, because the bullets hit vital points, he was barely alive on the way. After arriving at the hospital, he died. At 5:30 PM on the evening of the 20th, his family moved Chen's body to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Taras Road for burial.</p>
<p>Chen's Son Takes Precautions</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, when Chen was shot downstairs, his son Youtao (the current "Director-General of the General Affairs Department" of the puppet "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" of the "Reformed" puppet organization) was sleeping upstairs. Suddenly hearing a burst of gunfire, he initially suspected it was the sound of New Year's firecrackers. Hearing the noisy noises downstairs, he knew that something had happened. He quickly got up and ran to the staircase, closing the iron gate installed there to prevent anyone from rushing upstairs. Only after the dozen or so young people had completed their mission and helped one of the bodyguards away did Chen's son Youtao come downstairs in a panic. By that time, his father had been shot several times and was dying in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Chen Lu's Background</p>
<p>Chen, alias Renxian, was 62 years old and a native of Minhou, Fujian. He was a Jinshi in the late Qing Dynasty. Recommended by Zhang Zhidong, he studied at the University of Paris in France. He later served as an editor in the Hanlin Academy of the Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China, he served as Director of Political Affairs and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Beijing government. He later went abroad and served as the Minister to Mexico and France. Since the establishment of the National Government, Chen had been living in retirement at home. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chen had frequent contact with various officials of the "Reformed" puppet organization. He then lost his integrity in his old age and became the puppet "Minister of Foreign Affairs." His assassination has attracted considerable attention from all parties.</p>
<p>Discovery of Clues</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail said that after Chen Lu, the puppet "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the "Reformed Government," was killed on Sunday (the 19th) evening, the Public Concession Police Department had seized nine handguns. One of them has been identified as the gun used to kill a Qian. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station discovered three handguns on the night of the shooting incident, believed to belong to the bodyguards. Yesterday (the 20th) morning, the detectives went to the vicinity of Chen's residence and conducted a large-scale search in the gardens of various private houses along Yuyuan Road, discovering no less than six more handguns.</p>
<p>Tokyo Reaction</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd - After the news of the assassination of Chen Lu, the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the "Reformed Government," reached here, political figures and public opinion here have attached great importance to it and expressed great shock and anger. The "Asahi Shimbun" demanded that the Japanese government ask the Shanghai Municipal Council when it intends to take drastic action to eliminate certain elements in Shanghai. The newspaper believes that the frequent occurrence of such assassinations will greatly affect the relationship between Japan and other powers, especially Britain. The newspaper advocated that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai should "eliminate the anti-Japanese masses in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Puppet Town Chiefs of Western Shanghai Don Stage Makeup</h3>
<p>In the towns of Xinxijing, Huacao, Hongqiao, Caohejing, etc. in northwestern Shanghai, since the westward movement of the National Army, "Autonomous Associations" have been established under the protection of the Japanese. These are managed by a group of rogue local bullies who, in addition to flattering the enemy and willingly acting as slaves, specialize in extorting donations and taxes from merchants and civilians, issuing permits (each costing three or four yuan or more), and engaging in rampant exploitation and oppression of the local people as their only work. They even act as accomplices of tigers and collude with wolves. Last month, the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaonan reorganized the "Autonomous Associations" in various places into "Town Offices," and the former "Autonomous Association Chairmen" were appointed as "Town Chiefs." Six districts in western Shanghai were first designated for a pilot project. The announced Town Chiefs are Wang Ao of Beixinjing Town, Zhao Jiayu of Huacao Town, Hu Ding of Hongqiao Town, Chen Lin of Caohejing Town (merged with Longhua), a Guan of Caojiadu Town (merged with Zhoujiaqiao), and Lu He of Fahua Town. On the lunar New Year's Day, the Town Chiefs put on their stage makeup and performed their ugly plays. In addition, Miao Zhiren, chairman of the Seven Treasures Town Negotiation Association, Huang Siqing, chairman of the Meilong Town Autonomous Association, and Tang Linsheng, chairman of the Changqiao Town Autonomous Association, are currently planning and implementing similar projects in these three towns.</p>
<h3>Guerilla Warfare in Shanghai Suburbs During Lunar New Year, Three Battles Fought in Hongqiao District, Attempting to Attack Jiangwan and Approach Eastern Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury says that yesterday (the 17th) we received news that on Thursday (the 16th) night and yesterday (the 17th) morning, Chinese irregular forces and Japanese patrols fought three battles in the Hongqiao District. The rumor that guerrillas are once again active within the Japanese-controlled areas of Shanghai is therefore more credible. According to reliable sources, at 9:15 PM and 11:15 PM on Thursday night,</p>
<p>Many Foreigners</p>
<p>Residing in the suburbs of Hongqiao and MacArthur Terrace (transliteration) heard heavy gunfire. At 2:20 AM yesterday morning, gunfire was heard again. At the same time, Chinese irregular forces in this city issued warnings to Chinese residents in the Hongqiao District, stating that they should not go out after 8 PM. It is expected that during the upcoming Lunar New Year, there will be continued fighting. The Japanese authorities have banned the setting off of firecrackers during the New Year. Regarding the rumor that on Thursday,</p>
<p>Two Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>Were killed in the Yangshupu District, the Japanese authorities have denied it, saying that no Japanese soldiers were shot in that district. However, according to reliable sources, this rumor is not without foundation. It is said that what actually happened was that Chinese guerrillas took the offensive, attempting to capture Jiangwan on Wednesday and Thursday. But as they began their attack, Japanese reinforcements were dispatched to the area. Some guerrillas discovered that they were isolated from their own forces and</p>
<p>Fled into the Eastern District</p>
<p>And killed two Japanese soldiers on a bridge on the Lan Road River. However, inquiries at various police stations revealed that they had heard nothing about the reported shooting of Japanese soldiers. But if the report is true, then the two Japanese soldiers were killed on the bridge connecting Lan Road and Huade Road, because if they had been killed on another bridge, some of the nearby residents who were questioned yesterday would have heard the gunfire. Residents in the Huade Road area claimed that they had heard</p>
<p>What Sounded Like a Bomb</p>
<p>Explosion, but there was no definite news. According to news received yesterday, the Japanese authorities are now taking special precautions on Hongqiao Road, Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and Zhongshan Road, and have launched a large-scale search. Armed Japanese soldiers will be seen patrolling in the near future. At the same time, there are rumors that guerrillas in Pudong may launch a large-scale attack, which continues to make the Japanese authorities uneasy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Injured by Bullets on Nanjing Road, Beggar Injured in Right Leg</h3>
<p>At around 1:30 PM on the 19th, gunfire suddenly erupted on Nanjing Road in this city. At that time, two Japanese men and women had just finished eating at a restaurant and were waiting for their hired Yitai Company car. Suddenly, bullets were fired. One of the Japanese women was hit in the chest, hitting her breast. One of the two men was hit in the right shoulder, and the other suffered a minor abrasion to his right wrist. At that time, a beggar named Zhou Yun, from Nantong, 50 years old, was also shot in the right leg. The police officers on duty nearby heard the alarm and immediately split up to pursue the attackers. Because the incident was sudden, they did not catch anyone. Therefore, it is not yet known who the shooters were. Later, the police received a report and immediately launched a strict search. Meanwhile, the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that the two Japanese men are staff members of the Japanese military news department.</p>
<h3>Child Falls to Death While Playing</h3>
<p>A five-year-old boy, Xiangxiang, the son of a Du living at No. 17, Xinshou'an Lane, Huage Road, French Concession, was born chubby and lovable, and his parents loved him very much. At noon on the lunar New Year's Day (i.e., the 19th), he was playing on the third-floor balcony with other children living in the same building. Somehow, Xiangxiang suddenly lost his footing and fell from the balcony into the narrow alley behind the building. When he hit the ground, his head hit the water drain and the ground, and his brains immediately splattered. He was barely alive. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment but died. The parents cried bitterly upon hearing the news and nearly went mad.</p>
<h3>Fire on Robison Road, One Person Burned to Death, One Woman Also Severely Burned</h3>
<p>At about 10 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 21, Caishi Lane, Robison Road, in western Shanghai. Suddenly, the fire illuminated the sky, and thick smoke filled the air. The fire quickly spread to neighboring houses on both sides. Later, the fire brigade heard the alarm and drove to the scene, making every effort to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished after an hour. When the fire was raging, one man failed to escape and was burned to death. A woman, Jiang Shen, escaped from the fire, but was severely burned. She was taken by the fire brigade to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Anli Transportation Company Transports Military Supplies for the Japanese, Letter Demands Military Funds and Meeting, Two Arrested</h3>
<p>The Anli Transportation Company at No. 16, Park Villa, Lane 1423, Yuyuan Road, is a partnership between Gu Jiangsheng and Chen Adi (i.e., Chuan Liang). Because the company specializes in doing business with the Japanese, its business has flourished in recent months, and it has made considerable profits. At about 8 AM on the 16th of this month, three uninvited guests broke into the Anli Company, handed over</p>
<p>A letter and left. When the company opened the letter, it turned out to be a threatening letter. The letter read as follows: "To Gu and Chen, the two old bosses: Recently, you treacherous merchants have been transporting military supplies by car for the Japanese and are very prosperous. Now, a unit of our troops has been transferred to Shanghai for rest. The end of the year is approaching,</p>
<p>Military funds are insufficient for expenses. Please provide 1,500 yuan. Our captain will send someone to contact you at the Deyi Restaurant in the Xiaocaichang, Baxianqiao, French Concession. The contact should be made between 3 and 4 PM on the 29th of the lunar calendar. If there is no reply, there will be a later date. Captain Li Lun," and so on. Gu and others immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Detective Tang Jian, Detective Tie Guobin, and others to</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, together with detectives from the French Concession Police, waited at the Deyi Tea House at No. 82, Avenue Joffre. At 3:45 PM, two men, Hong Renjun from Anhui and Tao Junru from Jiangbei, came forward to contact them and were immediately arrested by the detectives and taken back to the police station for detention. On the morning of the 18th, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, saying that the case</p>
<p>Still needs investigation and requested that the hearing be postponed. According to Gu Jiangsheng and Chen Adi's report, they stated the contact situation and said that the Anli Company had not conducted any transactions for two months due to the situation. Before February, it did rent vehicles to the Japanese to transport military supplies. After a brief interrogation of the two defendants, Hong and Tao, the judge ordered them to be detained pending rescheduling the hearing for the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Conditions in the Suburbs During the Spring Festival, A Murky and Pestilent Atmosphere</h3>
<p>During the three days of the Lunar New Year, the war zones in the suburbs were tense due to the prevention of guerrilla activities. Residents stayed indoors and kept a low profile. Only a few small shops were closed on the streets, and there were few pedestrians. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Residents Scramble to Tear Down Absurd Spring Couplets: In the areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and western Shanghai where some streets are already inhabited, some shops were closed for three days according to the old customs. In order to ingratiate itself, the puppet "Municipal Government" had printed a large number of red-bottomed, black-lettered, nonsensical spring couplets in advance and forced them to be pasted on the doors of various shops and households. The phrases are divided into three types, many of which contain reactionary meanings. Here are three couplets to show their absurdity: "Love neighbors and be kind, sing together in a happy land," "Pacify the good and eliminate violence, celebrate the New Year together," "Resistance is weakening, the old government is gone; live in peace, the new business is revitalized," "The rising sun hangs high, rejoicing and cheering," "A good year, people enjoy the three springs." But not long after they were posted, people scrambled to tear them down.</p>
<p>Gambling and Opium Dens Flourish Like Demon Caves: During these 300 days, opium dens, gambling dens, and prostitution, under the collusion of Japanese ruffians and puppet officials, have sprung up in response to the times. They compete with the original opium dens, heroin dens, and large and small gambling dens for customers and business, and they are completely open in nature, with no one interfering. There are even gambling stalls lining the streets, enticing ignorant people and defrauding them of money using various tricks. Therefore, the four suburbs are full of a murky and pestilent atmosphere. Entering them is like walking into a demon cave.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Take Precautions, Water and Land Routes Remain Open: The Japanese troops, because of the numerous rumors in the four suburbs, fear that guerrillas will take the opportunity to operate, so they have to take careful precautions. They have increased the number of sentries guarding the ferries on both sides of the Huangpu River and the important highway bridges and roads on land. They strictly search residents entering and exiting. Those without puppet "citizen certificates" cannot pass. However, water and land transportation by boat and car are barely maintained, but there are few passengers and revenue is sharply reduced. The Japanese puppets suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>After Three Days, Puppet Officials "Pick Up Bones": All large and small organizations of the puppet "Municipal Government," except for the puppet "police officers on duty in the puppet police station," were notified by Chuan Xiaonan to take three days off (including Sunday). All the puppet "institutions" were as quiet as death. During the three days, the puppet officials with higher positions hid in secret places and dared not go out, for fear of encountering danger on the way. Small puppet officials flocked to the isolated island, indulging in pleasure and debauchery. The puppet "institutions" are scheduled to open today, and the puppet officials are all calling for "picking up bones" again.</p>
<h3>Colds and Coughs are Prevalent, A Gift from the Rapidly Changing Weather, "Weiling" Medicine is Quickly Effective</h3>
<p>Colds and coughs are very common diseases among Chinese people, and are most prevalent during times of rapid weather changes. Because they usually do not pose a life-threatening risk in the short term, everyone regards them as insignificant minor ailments and allows them to heal on their own. In fact, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Various acute infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, often arise from extremely ordinary colds and coughs. Tuberculosis begins with a cough, and the danger is unimaginable. Even if it develops into chronic bronchitis, turning into old age coughs, asthma with phlegm, the suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, Westerners regard colds and coughs as venomous snakes and beasts. Once they start, they immediately seek treatment and hope for a speedy recovery. Among common medicines, there is a kind of white pine syrup, which is a natural remedy for coughs. White pine is abundant in northern Europe, and Europeans suffering from lung diseases often sit and lie in white pine forests, inhaling its fragrant air, which has miraculous effects. Therefore, it is made into syrup and exported to foreign countries to benefit fellow sufferers. However, pure white pine syrup is not very effective. Weiling Pharmaceutical Company has specially formulated a compound white pine syrup according to the constitution of the Chinese people, with principal, assistant, and auxiliary ingredients. It can dissolve phlegm, relieve cough, suppress spasm, and relieve asthma. It is fragrant and palatable, and suitable for both the old and the young. Compared with pure white pine syrup, its efficacy is multiplied many times. People suffering from colds and coughs should not hesitate. Quickly purchase Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup. Each bottle is priced at one yuan, a special price of 75 cents. Sold at Zhengwei Pharmacy at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Malu. Telephone 92525. No delivery service for purchases.</p>
<h3>Customs Receives Two Merchant Ships for Smuggling Suppression in the Huangpu River, Asia Sheng and Wan Li</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs patrol ships, including eleven large and small ships such as Heguang, Fuxing, Lianxing, Yunxing, Fucheng, and Jiaoji, have been detained by the Japanese. Only Heguang and Liuxing remain, and because they are grain transport ships, they are still used by the Customs, regularly carrying out the task of supplying food and fish to offshore lighthouses and light buoys, so the task of suppressing piracy at sea has long been abandoned and cannot be carried out. At the same time, the anti-smuggling work in the port of Shanghai is also lacking in vessels, so cases of smuggling and drug trafficking have occurred repeatedly. It is now learned that the Japanese have agreed to issue the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships Asia Sheng and Wan Li to the Customs for use. The two ships have been received by Shanhaiguan, and after a slight refitting, they will be used for anti-smuggling in the Huangpu River, and will not be dispatched to sea to arrest pirates. Because the Japanese have imposed a blockade on the seas of our country, the Customs, in order to avoid misunderstandings, has voluntarily given up maritime patrol work.</p>
<h3>The Puppet "Municipal Government" Abolishes the Water Rescue Team, Swift Currents at the Blockade Line, Drowning Victims Will Have No Rescue</h3>
<p>Because the water flow at the Sixteen Shop Blockade Line was rapid and often caused ferries and sampans to capsize and drown people, the puppet "Municipal Government" had previously organized a water rescue team, with expenses subsidized by the puppet "Municipal Government." There were a total of eight people, each team member receiving 33 yuan per month, and one squad leader receiving 44 yuan per month. Since Chuan Xiaonan took office as "Mayor," he has installed many private individuals and greatly embezzled money. However, he ordered the abolition of this organization, which benefited the people, on the 15th of this month. In the future, if there are capsized ships near the Huangpu River blockade line, there will be no one to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police and Puppet Police Arrest Eight Chinese, Searching and Arbitrarily Arresting People Near the Pentagon, Taking Them Away in Vehicles</h3>
<p>At the western end of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road, near the Pentagon, around 9:45 AM the day before yesterday, eight Chinese were suddenly arrested by Japanese military police and puppet police. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Before this incident, two Japanese military police, wearing khaki uniforms, led more than thirty puppet police, each carrying a rifle, in a Japanese military truck. In addition, four armed Japanese soldiers in four cars successively arrived near the Pentagon and swarmed down, immediately searching houses in the Xin Sen Li and Er Kang Li areas. Residents who witnessed this scene were terrified and had no way to avoid it, and their homes were arbitrarily searched for over an hour. As a result, Lu Pengjiang (30 years old), a Shaoxing man who dealt in silk and satin from No. 30 Xin Sen Li, and Cai Dingkang (24 years old), Cai Dingzheng (19 years old), workers from the Public Welfare Yarn Factory in Chongming, Mao Laigou, a peddler from Chongming, Shi Cailang, and a Mr. Gong from Chongming who dealt in foreign cloth in No. 31, were arrested. Two young men were also arrested in Er Kang Li, forcefully dragged onto the truck, and sped eastward on Extra-Settlement Road. The families of those arrested are unclear about the reasons for the arrests. However, it is rumored that the Japanese soldiers took this action because, according to the puppet police at the time, they wanted to arrest a Mr. Wang and a Mr. Zhu.</p>
<h3>Wife Lives with Lover, Husband Seeks Revenge, Gathers Crowd to Borrow Money, Takes the Opportunity to Kill, Lover Killed with Three Axe Blows on the Spot</h3>
<p>Sun Zhangxing, 41 years old, from Nanhui, Pudong, is a servant at a Westerner's house at 1730 Avenue Joffre. He has been living with Han Chen, 29 years old, the wife of Han Daochun, a Shanghai resident at No. 5, Lane 57, Panxing Road, for two years. She has turned her back on her husband and lives with Sun, sharing meals and lodging.</p>
<p>Appearing like Husband and Wife, it aroused the jealousy of her husband, who could do nothing about it but harbor resentment in his heart, long intending to take revenge on Sun. On the night of the 20th of this month, her husband, Han Daochun, brought three people home and asked Sun to borrow 300 yuan for an urgent need, pretending to be calm. Sun did not refuse and took out dozens of yuan in banknotes to lend him. Han accepted it,</p>
<p>Said goodbye with a smile. Sun saw him off at the door. Unexpectedly, at that moment, the three people waiting outside the door pulled out sharp axes and struck Sun's right hand with one axe. Because he reached out to resist, his thumb was chopped off. Then, he was violently struck twice on the back of the head, his brains splattering. Sun immediately fell to the ground. The murderers and her husband saw that their goal had been achieved and fled in a panic. Neighbors and</p>
<p>Sun's lover, Han Chen, came out to see, Sun had already died. They reported to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body of Sun was sent to the morgue of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. Meanwhile, Sun's lover, Han Chen, was taken in for questioning to investigate the murderers. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Special No. 2 Court, and Prosecutor Wang and a coroner arrived at the scene. It was confirmed that the deceased died from</p>
<p>Axe Wounds. Because no family members were present, after the handling detective reported the case, the official ordered the body to be handed over to the hall for burial. Later, the deceased's wife, Sun Peng, received the news in her hometown and rushed over. Friends of the deceased raised funds to prepare a coffin and collect the body, and then requested the court to issue a certificate to retrieve the body and coffin and transport it back for burial. They also reported to the French police station, requesting a strict search for the escaped murderers to bring them to justice and redress the injustice.</p>

Suddenly, she heard gunshots outside the door. Li ran out to see when someone fired a shot, and the bullet hit Li's waist, penetrating her.

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Please note that the name of the commodity "Ajinomoto" is legally exclusively used by our company, and only our company manufactures "Ajinomoto". The news about the Taiyi Ajinomoto Factory published in your newspaper today may cause misunderstandings. Please publish this letter in the Letters column to correct the record. Sincerely, Tianchu Ajinomoto Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Factory Affairs Management Office, February 18.</p>
<p>To the Editor, We have been jointly informed by our clients, Ms. Zhang Qin, Ms. Zhang Dai, and Mr. Zhang Haoqiu, that they were shocked to read the news published in your newspaper on the 15th of this month under the local news section, "Jeweler's Elderly Mother Accuses Grandson of Theft". The estate of the late Zhang Bingxin should legally be jointly inherited by Haoqiu and Bingxin's daughter, Haoqiu's sister, Hao Yu. Previously, Qin, Dai, Haoqiu, and others invited friends to check and copy the inventory and seal it to the Huang residence for safety. The grandmother, Ou, was fully aware of this. Later, an evaluation committee was organized to conduct the valuation, and Haoqiu and Hao Yu successively sent letters to Ou and announced the analysis in the newspaper. It can be seen that everything was open and transparent, so how could there be any theft? As for Ou's daily expenses, there is an income of more than 100 yuan per month from the rent of rooms 28 to 31, Continental Square, Luban Road, which is more than enough to provide the necessary support. Now it is reported that Ou has made false accusations, which they had no prior knowledge of, and the court summons has not yet been received. If it is true, then the law must be based on facts, and criminal evidence must be used as the basis for conviction. False accusations and abuse of litigation have their own deserved punishment. However, the value of the jade tripod mentioned in the article is 50,000 yuan, which is even more untrue. The total value of Binggong's entire estate is not even this much. Before the valuation, Ou was invited to recommend a member of the committee, and each item of the estate was recorded in the valuation book. A jade furnace was valued at only 500 yuan, with the personal signatures of the evaluation committee members as proof, which can be verified separately. It is absolutely impossible to fabricate and harm. Deeply fearing that rumors will spread and confuse the hearing, we entrust you to write a letter to clarify the facts and make them clear. Sincerely, Lawyers Shen Weihan and Sun Qiying, February 18, 1939.</p>

<h3>Conditions for a Successful Science Teacher</h3>
<p>— Shang Yao</p>
<p>A successful science teacher, of course, studies his specialized subject diligently, but also reads widely in other scientific fields.</p>
<p>He knows how to teach and how to teach science.</p>
<p>He can express his own meaning clearly. He has abundant information on the podium and in the laboratory, and his hands are more skilled and delicate. He can manage instruments and, even more, manage the order of the crowd.</p>
<p>He has a philosophical demeanor. He is also well-versed in history and can sit in a room with young students, talking at length about the lives of Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Darwin, and other philosophers.</p>
<p>In addition, he is more responsible and has confidence in his work.</p>
<p>A science teacher may have a first-class laboratory, ample time, and an ideal plan, but unless he really knows how to teach and is enthusiastic about teaching, he has no hope of success. Conversely, if he is truly enthusiastic and studious, he will succeed even without good equipment.</p>
<p>Success or failure depends entirely on the person, and all difficulties can be overcome.</p>

<p>"The whole family is in the wind, and the clothes for September have not yet been cut." This is a famous line from a Qing dynasty poet: The poet's elegance cannot withstand the wind, so we will put aside elegance for now and talk about the practical issue of staying warm.</p>
<p>I really admire animals. When it gets cold, they don't have the trouble of sweaters and coats. What methods do they use to keep warm? As far as our simple observation with the naked eye is concerned, everyone knows that they have feathers, but everyone must wonder how they can be the same in winter and summer? In fact, some animals can change their feathers or fur according to the cold and heat, while other animals have other ways. They just change the "still air" contained in the fur layer, either increasing or decreasing its capacity, which is the way to regulate cold and heat. Because air is not very conductive of heat, thickening the air in the fur layer makes it easy to retain heat, which is the way to deal with the cold, while thinning the air in the fur layer makes it easier for body heat to dissipate, which is the way to deal with the heat. Imagine comparing the amount of air contained when the fur is spread flat on the skin and when the fur is upright on the skin, we can easily understand that the amount of air contained when it is upright is always more. Therefore, one of the ways animals keep warm is by "raising their fur." There is a muscle near the hair root in the skin, called the "arrector pili muscle," which uses its contraction to raise the hair.</p>
<p>Do we humans have hair? Yes, but too little. Do we have arrector pili muscles? Yes, about the same amount as hair. "When the north wind rises, we shiver." If we try to open our clothes and face it, everyone will find small bumps on their skin, just like goosebumps. This is the result of the contraction of the arrector pili muscle. However, human hair has degenerated, so although the arrector pili muscle does its best, it is still useless. Therefore, in order to obtain a layer of cold-proof air, we must rely on animal fur—leather goods—or other materials containing a large amount of air, such as wool, etc. This has been personally tested by gentlemen and ladies wearing fox fur or fur-lined coats. The reason why clothes keep warm lies in this.</p>
<p>Physiology has a term: "Clothing is the same price as food." This means that if you don't wear clothes in the cold, your body temperature will inevitably be greatly lost, and our way to make up for this loss is to eat more. In other words, if I wear more clothes, my body temperature can be retained, and those things that I eat more to compensate for the loss can be avoided, so it is said that the value of clothes and those things is the same. So, a clever friend came; he put on a fur robe, lined with a cotton quilt, and lay in a nanmu coffin, with an ebony outer coffin on top. He said that the still air outside the body was more than sufficient, and his body temperature would naturally be foolproof. In this way, he could refuse food and spend the winter safely. However, in less than an hour, he was sweating like a slurry, and in less than a whole day, his stomach was rumbling with hunger (the coffin lid was of course not covered). The reason why he was sweating like a slurry is a long story, so we'll leave it at that. As for the rumbling hunger, it clearly proves that the mission of food is more than just one. In addition to the part that is the same price as clothes, there are other missions that clothes cannot replace. We'll also have to leave the mission of food at that. But we already understand that clothes cannot replace food, but can only be the same price as it under certain conditions. Conversely, the same is true for food: food cannot replace clothes (for keeping warm), but can only be the same price as it under certain conditions. Therefore, if you swim in the Arctic naked, even if you are followed by as many Manchu and Han chefs as you want, you will inevitably freeze to death.</p>
<p>Maybe someone wants to ask, what kind of clothes, what style of clothes, are scientific?</p>
<p>Oh! Under the slogan of national unity and thrift, my answer is so simple: the unit of keeping warm is cotton clothes and cotton pants.</p>

<h3>Scientific Strange Tales</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Black Ore</p>
<p>When Marco Polo first came to China, he was quite surprised to see the Chinese using coal to burn fire. In his writings, he called the Chinese able to use a kind of black ore (Black mineral) to achieve the effect of fire. At that time, Europe did not know the effect of coal, and its cultural level was far inferior to the Chinese nation. Hundreds of years later, with the development of science, Europe has become a new world, and our country has been controlled by others due to its scientific backwardness, which can be sighed for!</p>
<p>Big Old Monster</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, in Nanxiawa, Beiping, a strange bird sound was heard at night. After a long time, it was never seen what it was. Later, because it was heard every night, the residents were worried that it was a monster. The police station sent a team to investigate and found a large bird in the reeds, white, with a large sac hanging under its beak, bright red. When the wind blew, its beak opened and its sac expanded. The sound it made was the same as what was heard at night. It flapped its wings and flew away. Those who saw it called it the big old monster. For a time, all newspapers carried it. This bird is called a pelican, also known as Taohe (Pelican). It is common in the northern rivers. It eats fish and is in the same family as cormorants. It uses the large sac under its beak to catch fish in the water, like a dragnet. This is an ordinary bird, but it is rarely seen in the city. The residents pointed it out as a monster, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Strange Frogs</p>
<p>In the past, thousands of frogs were suddenly seen in the city of Beiping, marching in teams from one place to another, lasting for several days and nights without stopping. The residents all thought it was an ominous sign. At that time, the rainfall was quite large, which was different from the spring drought of previous years. Frogs lay many eggs. In dry weather, most of them die. Only when they develop to the tadpole stage do they die due to lack of water and food. Therefore, there are fewer frogs each year. But that year, due to excessive rain, most of the eggs and tadpoles were able to grow up. The old and young frogs were overcrowded, so they moved together. Only because there were too many of them did the above-mentioned phenomenon occur, which has nothing to do with good or bad luck.</p>
<p>Old Maids Revive the Nation</p>
<p>Darwin once said that the abundance of purple clover in various parts of England is due to the large number of bees, which help its hybridization. The large number of bees is due to the decrease in the number of rats, because rats are enough to harm bees. The decrease in the number of rats is due to the increase in the number of cats, because cats like to kill rats. The increase in the number of cats is due to the fact that old maids in various places like to raise cats the most. From this, it can be seen that organisms are interconnected in a network of relationships. Vogt said that in the middle of the nineteenth century, the breeding of purple clover in England enriched animal husbandry, the beef was very beautiful and cheap, and everyone could eat it. The mental and physical strength of the British were particularly developed. Scientific inventions were heard almost every day, and industrial and commercial undertakings expanded day by day. The achievements in exploration were also very good. The power of the British people spread all over the world, making them a first-class power in the world.</p>
<h3>Human Motorboat, How Wonderful!</h3>

<p>A small gasoline engine and a propeller are installed on the butt of a small boat, and it can be turned into a motorboat. Then, if a swimmer installs the same propeller, wouldn't he also be able to become a motorboat? In fact, this gadget has been made by someone. It is said that it was very popular on the beach in Miami, USA, last summer. The swimmer installed a small propeller on his back and waist, used his limbs as a rudder, turned freely, and the speed was extremely high. Jun Qi's illustration</p>

<h3>Wealth from Volcanoes</h3>
<p>— Xi Wei</p>
<p>Volcanic eruptions are indeed major disasters that destroy life and property, but they can move the reserves inside the earth to the ground for the use of organisms on the ground. Their contribution to blessing organisms is indeed not small.</p>
<p>The gifts sent by volcanoes from their chimneys are diverse, from gold and diamonds to dust and drinkable water, there is everything.</p>
<p>Many metals, especially the heavier and rarer ones, are often found in large quantities of volcanic rock. The reason is that they are dissolved by acid vapors deep underground, carried to locations near the surface, and then remain there in a concentrated state for our use.</p>
<p>Many non-metals also come from the same source, with sulfur being the most prominent. Those that are less prominent and more important are chlorine gas, which is part of the gas exhaled by volcanoes, and the salt that is indispensable to our lives is formed by its combination with sodium.</p>
<p>The most abundant of all fluids ejected from volcanoes is a very common compound—water. Water is part of the crystal structure of rocks. When rocks are chemically decomposed in the process of a volcanic eruption, this water that has been bound by the stone for a long time is also released and escapes to the ground.</p>
<p>Another gas that is extremely important for life is also released in the volcanic chimney. It is the same as the gas emitted from man-made chimneys, namely carbon dioxide. After it is absorbed by plants, they begin to make food. It combines with phosphorus and calcium in animal bodies to become bones and shells. Finally, we must also attribute the origin of coral and pearls to volcanoes.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Book "Chinese Forest Flora"</h3>
<p>— Que Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Edited by Qian Chongshu, jointly printed by the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China and the Forest and Land Reclamation Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, published in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China, priced at two yuan in national currency. Available at the China Science Book and Instrument Company, 649 Foch Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Through the efforts of several scholars over the past decade, China's higher plant taxonomy has gradually taken shape, making significant contributions not only to academic fields but also revealing the location of our country's plant resources, which is of great importance to national economic construction and the future of the war effort.</p>
<p>Due to these outstanding research achievements, there have been many related publications. In addition to various research papers, there are also numerous specialized works. The earliest was Chen Huanyong's "Chinese Economic Trees," followed by the "Chinese Plant Atlas" (four volumes published) co-edited by Hu Xiansu and Chen Huanyong. Recently, Chen Rong's "Chinese Trees" and other books have been published, all of which are highly valuable scientific works. However, these specialized publications often focus on academic theory and pay little attention to the economic uses of the trees described. Qian's book is a good choice for those seeking a balance between academic theory and economic value.</p>
<p>Although the editorial plan of this book is not explicitly stated, it can be seen from the structure that it selects important Chinese forest plants for description based on the system of plant taxonomy. Each volume contains fifty species. It first examines and determines the botanical names, referencing extensive literature; then describes the morphology in detail; then discusses the geographical distribution in China; then details the value of propagation, cultivation, and afforestation; and finally explores the various economic uses in detail. Roots, bark, flowers, leaves, seeds, and wood are all thoroughly examined. Which can be used as raw materials for papermaking, which can be used as aircraft materials, which can be used as furniture, which can be used to build warships and vehicles, whether seeds can be pressed for oil or used for food, whether flowers and leaves can be used for ornamental purposes or to make fragrances and medicines, etc., all should be detailed. After reading the description of each plant, readers will understand its various economic uses and value in national defense construction. It is not only a good textbook for agricultural and forestry schools, but also an indispensable reference book for those engaged in afforestation and plant production.</p>
<p>Another feature of this book is that all the plants discussed are accompanied by exquisitely drawn illustrations. In addition to accurate depictions of leaves and stems, flowers and fruits are also shown in enlarged dissections to facilitate identification by scholars. The exquisite printing and excellent paper quality are evident to all and need not be赘述. However, there are some typographical errors that are easy to correct.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Relief Association Issues Declaration for Soliciting Production and Education Funds for Refugees; Educational Circles Voluntarily Propose Donating 10% of School Subsidies</h3>
<p>The Education Group Solicitation Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has launched a campaign to raise funds for refugee production and education. It has received support from educational circles and student families throughout the city and has begun fundraising. The following is the "Declaration for Fundraising for Refugee Production and Education" issued by the association:</p>
<p>Fundraising Declaration</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, there are still 100,000 refugees in Shanghai's various shelters, including 63,000 adults and 37,000 children. This number is not small. Raising funds for the relief of these refugees is, of course, a huge problem. However, Shanghai has a population of four million. If each of the four million residents is willing to contribute as much as they can, it is not too difficult to provide relief to 100,000 refugees, and it is our responsibility to do so in this extraordinary period. The educational and cultural circles of this city, as well as the 200,000 young students, have already made great efforts in the past for refugee relief. However, as long as the refugee problem is not resolved, our responsibility is not over. Our continued donations in the future still depend on the efforts of our educational and cultural circles and our beloved young students.</p>
<p>In terms of refugee relief work, the minimum requirement is to ensure that refugees are not hungry or cold and are not displaced. In other words, it is to provide sustenance for refugees. However, it is absolutely insufficient to only provide sustenance without education. In addition to sustenance, we must find ways to enhance the intelligence of refugees and cultivate their productive capacity. Therefore, the provision of refugee education and the training of production skills are very important and urgent. Refugees will eventually be resettled and will eventually return to their hometowns. If we do not take this opportunity to provide them with appropriate education and teach them production skills, then the livelihood problems of refugees will still not be solved after resettlement and after returning to their hometowns. Therefore, only the combination of education and sustenance is active and thorough relief.</p>
<p>Therefore, this association has invited enthusiastic people from the educational and cultural circles of Shanghai to launch a fundraising campaign. The purpose is to raise a sum of money to promote refugee education and run refugee production enterprises. The goal of this fundraising is 100,000 yuan. This association will prepare "Charity Medals" to be issued to schools and organizations and will be given to enthusiastic people who donate one yuan each. The purpose is clear and upright, and the method is simple and easy to implement. We sincerely hope that our colleagues in the educational and cultural circles, as well as all 200,000 of the city's beloved young students, will enthusiastically donate with the aim of "the greatest joy in doing good," so that the goal of 100,000 yuan can be achieved in one fell swoop, and from then on, refugee education work and production enterprises can be smoothly promoted. Then, not only will 100,000 refugees benefit greatly, but the contribution to the country and society will also be significant. This is the declaration.</p>
<p>Educational Circles Propose Donating 10% of Subsidies</p>
<p>In order to expand the fundraising for the refugee production and education fund, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has launched a city-wide mobilization of all large, medium, and small schools to solicit donations from students and parents starting on the 18th of this month. Since its implementation, the results have been very good. Now, educational circles have jointly proposed to voluntarily contribute 10% of the educational subsidies from the Public Concession Municipal Council this year to relief funds. According to the current total amount of subsidies for each school, which is 160,000 yuan, raising 10% would also amount to 16,000 yuan, which is not a small amount. At the same time, it is suggested that the Relief Association use the students of each school at graduation to prepare exquisite handbooks and use the proceeds to fund refugee production and education. The effect will be very significant. The authorities of the association are pleased to accept the spirit of automatic donation and the good suggestions of the educational circles and will use this as a long-term relief fund for the educational circles in the future.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Education in Jiangsu Province (Part 2): Middle and Elementary School Teachers Continue to Dedicate Themselves to Education; Schools Are Still Established in Guerrilla Areas North and South of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Secondary Education: There were originally more than 30 provincial secondary schools in Jiangsu Province. After the outbreak of the war, a small number of provincial schools were unable to hold classes due to their proximity to the war zone. The remaining schools continued to operate. After the fall of Shanghai and the capital, all provincial schools north and south of the Yangtze River were suspended. At that time, the provincial government considered the area north of Jiangsu to be relatively safe, and it was not feasible for young students to be out of school for a long time. Therefore, it was decided to establish two provincial joint middle schools to accommodate teachers and students from provincial middle schools in the war zone. The First Joint Middle School was located in Lianshui, with Wu Hailou as the principal. The Second Joint Middle School was located in Yancheng, with Qi Shuzu as the principal. Since Japanese troops landed in Tianshenggang on March 17, these two schools were closed. The provincial government asked Chairman Han to use military vehicles to transport students who wished to go west, and they continued to attend classes in Wanxian, Sichuan, until now. The principal is still Wu Hailou. In mid-April, the Provincial Department of Education, considering that there were still many middle school students out of school in the area north of Jiangsu, adopted the principle of breaking up the whole into parts and promulgated the Regulations for Self-Study and Tutoring Groups for Secondary Schools in the War Zone. Each group consisted of 50 people and hired teachers with secondary school qualifications to tutor the main subjects. For a time, such groups were established in counties such as Taixian, Xinghua, Gaoyou, and Baoying. At the same time, several private middle schools opened in various counties in northern Jiangsu, such as the Private Yangzhou Middle School, which moved to Gaoyou to hold classes, the Zhongnan Middle School, which established a branch in Baoying, the Shanghai Huguang Middle School, which established a branch in Taixing, and the Guangshi Middle School Association, which established a branch in Dongtai. The Qiaoguang Middle School, etc., once had branches in Rugao. However, the Guangshi and Qiaoguang branches were suspended due to the fall of Tongru. After July, the provincial middle schools in southern Jiangsu successively moved to Shanghai to resume classes, including Suzhong, Yangzhong, Sunushi, Zenshi, Sishi, Songnushi, Suguang, Nantong Middle School, Changzhong, Zhenzhong, Songjiang High School, Taishi, and other schools. In the north of Jiangsu, the Provincial Department of Education also planned to establish nine temporary middle schools and normal schools in Xuhai, Huaiyan, Xingtongtai, and other areas, based on the principle of setting them up in rural areas. In this way, secondary education in Jiangsu Province gradually gained vitality. In addition, the junior middle schools in Jiangdu, Xinghua, Taixian, Taixing, Lianshui, Huaian, Gaoyou, Huaiyin, Baoying, and other counties in the lower reaches of the Huai River continued to open as usual. In Yixing, in southern Jiangsu, the county Education Bureau also planned a county-run junior middle school to continue classes in the guerrilla area.</p>
<p>Elementary Education: After the fall of the counties in southern Jiangsu, most of the elementary schools in the cities and towns were suspended. Many of the elementary schools in the rural areas were still supported by the original teachers. These people generally do not receive public subsidies but rely on a sincere enthusiasm to win the sympathy of the villagers. Recently, counties such as Yixing, Jiading, Juxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha have restored elementary schools one after another. Although the treatment is very low, the teachers deeply feel that elementary education is the basic education of the country and are happy to engage in it. In the counties of northern Jiangsu, even under the extremely tight financial resources for education, they still try their best to maintain it and strive to promote wartime education. The education bureaus of each county have formulated general guidelines for the implementation of wartime education and ordered the elementary schools to comply with them. In addition, in order to relieve out-of-school children and unemployed teachers in the war zone, the counties in northern Jiangsu have increased the number of temporary elementary schools to accommodate them. For example, the Xinghua County Temporary Elementary School was opened in March of the 27th year and was initially headed by Jin Yingwu. Later, Jin was transferred to the Director of the Xinghua Education Bureau and was succeeded by Zhao Shiru as the principal. The Temporary Elementary School in Taixian was headed by Zhang Xianwu and was scheduled to open in February of the 28th year.</p>
<h3>Proposals for the National Education Conference from Various Educational Organizations in This City; More Than Ten Proposals Have Been Delivered</h3>
<p>The National Education Conference will be held in Chongqing starting on March 1. Various educational organizations in this city, including large, medium, and small schools, have jointly formulated more than ten proposals for developing and rectifying education in this city during the Anti-Japanese War. They have already been sent to the Ministry of Education for discussion.</p>
<p>School News</p>
<p>Shanghai Women's University and Middle School: Shanghai Women's University on Xin Dagu Road has paid more and more attention to the quality of students this semester. In addition to expanding the library and equipment as much as possible, it also holds academic or celebrity lectures during memorial weeks. Yesterday, it invited Zhao Yidong, the secretary-general of the school, to speak on "Building Life." Mr. Zhao is knowledgeable and has a deep understanding of life philosophy. He elaborated in great detail at the time, and the audience listened intently. Next week, Lin Kanghou will be invited to give a lecture at the school.</p>
<p>Xiangyao Middle School: Since the beginning of this semester, Xiangyao Middle School at 289 Shandong Road, Jiujiang Road intersection, has made more and more improvements in education. The library has recently added a large number of literary books and has begun lending them out. The principal personally reviews the students' original in-class and out-of-class homework notebooks and diaries. Thirty-six students with excellent homework scores in the last semester, including Chen Zhigang and Fei Heming, were awarded cash prizes ranging from ten to six yuan by the school to show encouragement. This semester, scholarship and financial aid measures have also been established to reward students with excellent character and academics and students in need. In addition, Bu Huilian, the honorary principal of the school, is scheduled to come to the school to speak at 2:00 p.m. on February 26.</p>
<p>Fuwei Guo Ying Night School: In order to meet the learning desires of general commercial youth and improve their work efficiency, the Fuwei Guo Ying Night School has been established in this city.

<h3>Charity Football Match: Huali loses miserably by one goal; Western United wins by luck with a score of 3-2; Lu Zhongen loses the country carelessly; Gao Huaide bids 400 yuan to purchase the match ball</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Charity Football Match, sponsored by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association, Huali vs. Western United, met again at the Yiyuan Stadium on the day after the Lunar New Year (20th) at 3:00 p.m. The two sides were evenly matched, and the game was extremely tense. After an hour and a half of fierce battle, each side scored two goals, and the outcome was undecided. Until the last five minutes, unfortunately, due to the mistake of goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, the "yellow-haired" Lobastov took advantage of the opportunity and shot the ball into the empty goal, calmly rolling it into the net. Huali then lost again by a score of 2-3. Huali had already lost 1-2 in last year's Christmas charity match, and it is a pity that they still failed to retaliate. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, the Yiyuan Stadium was crowded with people, totaling no less than 10,000 people, with an income of more than 6,000 yuan. After the match, the match ball was auctioned off, and Gao Huaide, the president of the Lido Sports Association, generously donated 400 yuan to purchase it. The second match, Lido vs. the Army United, is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 5th of next month (Sunday) at the Yiyuan Stadium.</p>

<p>Lu Zhongen Zhang Xueyao Zhuang Youren Xu Chengxun Tan Fuzhen Jiang Zhaoxiang Cao Qiuting Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Xu Wenkui Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Dutch Consul Opens the Match: The Dutch Consul-General to Shanghai, Mr. Bao Xuewen, President of the International Relief Committee, accompanied by Mr. Li Guiyong, Executive Director of the Relief Committee, performed the opening ceremony. The match was affected by yesterday's heavy rain all day, and the field was muddy and slippery. The performance of both sides was greatly diminished. Although Xiao Dai, the forward of Huali, was absent, Li Yichen was replaced, and the performance was still perfect. The ferocity was far above Western United, which was most satisfying. Tan Fuzhen's center was mediocre and failed to stand out. Xu Chengxun and Zhang Xueyao also had occasional loopholes, causing Fafanxiao and Fohn to be extraordinary in their activities. Because the rear line could not provide sufficient support, the forward line was often seen returning in vain. The forwards of Western United did not cooperate as well as the five tigers of Huali. However, the center back line was strong and terrifying. Maxigan can be described as outstanding. Willie Walter's goalkeeper performed the best, saving countless dangerous balls. The last hurdle for the five tigers of Huali was that their barrage of shots failed to break into the goal. This was the person.</p>
<p>Opening the Record: After the two sides came into contact, Sun Tie Leg opened the record first. Thompson and Robert of Western United scored three consecutive goals. In the first half, Huali was 1-2 behind. In the second half, Xu Wenkui topped the flower, tied the score. It is a pity that in the last five minutes, Lu Zhongen rushed out, trying to intercept Fafanxiao, but was unexpectedly picked by Fafanxiao, and Lobastov sat back and reaped the benefits, shooting the ball into the empty goal. After the kickoff, Western United attacked fiercely. Later, because Robert committed a handball, he was sent into the Western United area. Sun Tie Leg raised his foot and shot fiercely, but it was caught by Willie. Jia Youliang carried the ball forward, and Li Yichen swept forcefully in front of the goal, also falling into Willie's hands. After fifteen minutes of stalemate, Jia Youliang hooked in, Li Yichen headed Sun Jinshun, and Tie Leg swept in, opening the record first. Fafanxiao passed cleverly to the middle, and the three forwards missed the opportunity one after another. Tang quickly raised his legs and scored, only three minutes away from losing the ball. Youliang hooked in again, Li Yichen's shot was saved, and Xu Wenkui added a kick, but it crossed the crossbar, and the good opportunity was lost, which is a pity. In twenty-five minutes, Lobastov got Thompson's pass and knocked on the door. The long-legged deer failed to save, the ball rolled towards the goal, Robert rushed up and pushed it straight into the net. At the end of the first half, Western United took the lead with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>Miserable Loss by One Goal: Changing places and fighting again, Huali's Cao Qiuting passed the ball to Xu Wenkui. Xu moved forward and picked it up. Li Yichen lay down and launched. The ball bounced back from Willie's foot. Xu caught it and knocked again and was kicked out by Willie. Not long after, Huali got a free kick opportunity. Sun Tie Leg kicked from 25 yards away from the goal, with an extremely fierce sweep, but it was caught by Willie. Youliang, Tie Leg, and Wenkui shot again and again, but Willie was agile and all became illusions. After seventeen minutes, Jia Youliang cut in from the bottom line, and Xu Wenkui waited for a good shot and headed the ball into the net, clearly and beautifully, winning warm applause and tying the score at 2-2. Western United counterattacked again and again, but all failed. After a stalemate until the last five minutes, Fafanxiao got Fohn's shot, carried the ball and rushed in. Lu Zhongen rushed out in a panic, but was picked up by Fafanxiao in the middle. Lobastov reaped the rewards and shot into the empty goal. Before long, the game ended, and Huali lost miserably by a score of 2-3.</p>

<h3>Wonderful Basketball Performance: Washington University Wins Over Paramount; The Reputation is Well-Deserved, the Skills are Superb, the Result is 62 to 54</h3>
<p>The basketball team of the University of Washington in the United States (i.e., the representative team of the Seattle Amateur Athletic Association) arrived in Shanghai by the Asama Maru on the morning of the 18th (Saturday), a group of eight people, led by Captain Ross Winner and Manager Ralph Carnae. That evening at 8:00 p.m., they played a performance match with the Paramount team at the Western Youth Basketball Hall. The basketball skills of Washington University were indeed well-deserved, and the performance was superb. They won by a large margin of 39 to 15 in the first half. In the second half, Paramount worked hard to counterattack, and Washington University's offense and defense were also more relaxed. The result was 62 to 54, and Paramount lost by only eight points. The Western Youth Basketball Hall was crowded with people who came to admire the skills, making it the first grand occasion after the Shenbao Cup. The entire team boarded the original ship on the 19th, the decisive day, and went to Japan, then to Honolulu, and then back to the United States. The competition in Japan with us has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Talk: According to the team manager Ralph Carnae, the reporter was told that this decision to go to the Philippines was at the invitation of the Philippine Basketball Association, and it was the strongest American basketball team in terms of skills and strength in the East. They played a total of 15 games in the Philippines, and they were invincible. Only the Japanese University United Team had some competition at the beginning, but it was controlled by them after entering. The team left Seattle on December 23 to go to the Philippines and is expected to return to the United States in early March. They may play again with the Japanese United Team in Japan, and there will be two games in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Skills: All the team members are unusually tall and strong, all over six feet tall. The team's cooperation, speed, and shooting skills have all reached the realm of perfection. It is even better than the South Pacific team in the previous decision. Its offensive method completely adopts the extremely wonderful blocking method to find gaps. The guards also follow up from behind, and the shooting is unrestricted by angles. The continuous throwing under the board is especially ingenious. The defense uses individual defense methods, but it does not specify dead nails, adapts to changes, and sees its "chrysanthemum cicada shedding its shell" everywhere. Wigner, Lovelich, and B. Aeger are the most outstanding players in the team.</p>
<p>Competition: Paramount's appearance was completely lost in panic and confusion, allowing Washington University to trample on it, with almost no power to parry. The offense was also at a loss, with no way to go with the ball. Cai Yanxiong scored first with a free throw, and then Darwin also scored. Paramount took the lead for the second time with a score of 4 to 3. From then on, it continued to lag behind. The first half ended with a score of 39 to 15, a difference of 24 points. In the second half, Paramount replaced Chen Xianglong with Jia Youliang, and he scored seven consecutive points, chasing to 22 to 39. Then Xu Wenkui was replaced by Zhou Dayun. Wenkui's long-range shooting was like a godsend, and he scored repeatedly. At 51 to 32, Xue Chong, Wenkui, and Youliang counterattacked with all their strength, scoring repeatedly. Washington University's offense and defense were also more relaxed, and the score was getting closer and closer. The result was 58 to 50, and Paramount lost with honor. Referees Blanc and Conrad.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong-Philippines Football Match: Philippine Team Loses Both Games; 4-1 Defeat to Hong Kong Interport; 5-3 Defeat to Hong Kong Chinese Team; Li Huitang's Undiminished Prowess</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong, 19th) The Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match was held here today, attracting a massive and unprecedented crowd. The Hong Kong team took a 1-0 lead in the first half and ultimately won decisively with a score of 4-1. Center forward Li Huitang scored three goals singlehandedly, and right winger Fupu scored one goal. Philippine right winger Reyas scored one goal when the score was 2-0. Li Huitang performed exceptionally well. The Philippine players displayed skillful play but lacked the final burst of energy.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 20th) The Philippine team participating in the Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match lost again to the Chinese team on the 20th with a score of 5-3, although their performance was better than on the 19th. Li Huitang of the Chinese team was tightly marked and unable to fully display his skills. Left winger Hou Chengtou was the most active player and the standout performer of the entire match. After the start of the game, the Philippine center forward opened the scoring, but Li Huitang quickly equalized with a penalty kick. Chengtou then scored two consecutive goals. The Philippine right forward and center forward also each scored a goal, resulting in a 3-3 draw at halftime. In the second half, Shanxi inside forward Li Zhaorong scored two goals, leading the Chinese team to a 5-3 victory. The Philippine team is scheduled to play the Hong Kong United team on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education Circle: Opinions on Reforming Education; Opinions on Improving Teacher Training Education in Our Country (Part 1) Wu Zengjie</h3>
<p>Elementary schools are the places where national education is implemented. The children receiving this education are between the ages of six and twelve, and they need the teaching and nurturing of excellent teachers to develop healthy bodies, lively spirits, practical knowledge, and good habits. Education is the foundation of a nation, and the prosperity or decline of a country depends on the level of education of its citizens. Therefore, if we want a strong nation, we must devote ourselves to the development of education. Among all levels of education, the elementary school stage is the starting point and should be given special attention. If we want to have perfect elementary schools, we should pay attention to cultivating good teachers. The current education system uses normal schools as institutions for training elementary school teachers. Normal schools are like mothers, and elementary schools are like sons. The health of the mother directly affects the physical and mental well-being of the infant. Therefore, we cannot ignore teacher training education if we want to improve elementary education. My opinions on improving teacher training education can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>Cultivating Students' Habits of Diligence: Current normal school students are the future elementary school teachers. Elementary school teachers have heavy workloads and live simple lives, so they must be accustomed to diligence to be competent. In the past, students at normal schools, except for a few located in rural areas, lacked training in labor. Some schools in cities had very elaborate school buildings, and students lived comfortable lives, inevitably acquiring the atmosphere of urban luxury and extravagance. Graduates of urban normal schools are often unwilling to serve in rural elementary schools. I believe that in the future, all normal schools should be located in rural areas, so that students are constantly in contact with the simple rural environment. School life should focus on labor to cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance, so that they do not regard elementary education as a daunting task. Moreover, in the future, rural elementary schools will have a greater need than urban ones. Locating normal schools in rural areas can allow students to acquire more knowledge of agriculture, increasing the efficiency of serving rural elementary schools.</p>
<p>Increasing Professional Training Time</p>
<p>Teacher training education can be divided into two aspects: general and professional. The former includes reading, writing, arithmetic, physical education, music, manual labor, history, geography, and scientific knowledge. The latter refers to elementary school teaching techniques, the selection and compilation of elementary school teaching materials, and knowledge of education and psychology. In the past, normal schools did not have much problem with general education, but professional training was insufficient, especially the training of elementary school teaching techniques. As a result, after graduating from normal school and serving in elementary schools, students still felt at a loss and groped in the dark. This situation can only be attributed to the inadequacy of normal school professional training and cannot be blamed on normal school graduates. In the future, the final year of normal schools should be devoted entirely to elementary school teaching, administrative internships, and the trial production of teaching materials, so that students not only thoroughly understand the practical work of elementary schools but also truly know how to do it. If increasing professional training affects general education, then it is necessary to extend the duration of normal school studies. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"The Meaning is Very Ordinary"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important of the five major events during the Lunar New Year holiday was Chairman Chiang's speech at the Third National Political Council. He repeatedly stated that there would be no compromise with Japan and encouraged the people to always put the interests of the nation first and actively resist Japan to save the country. He modestly said that his words were "very ordinary."</p>
<p>In our view, are his words truly ordinary? Of course, he did not present any novel theories to shock people's ears and eyes. In terms of being ordinary, they are indeed ordinary. However, we know that ordinary does not mean unimportant. On the contrary, the most ordinary things in the world are often the most important. Just as water and fire are ordinary, people cannot live a day without them.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Chairman Chiang's decisive statement, on the one hand, reiterated the determination to resist Japan, eliminating the corrupting idea of peace, and on the other hand, reminded the people not to become complacent over time and forget the current difficulties. Although the meaning is commonplace and very ordinary, it is of great significance at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. If everyone can keep it in mind and put it into practice, then the hope of victory can certainly be realized.</p>
<p>In addition to this national affair, the same is true in society and in personal matters: there are many principles that seem very ordinary, and everyone can understand, but their importance far exceeds their superficial ordinariness. For example, consider the principle of frugality. Who doesn't know its theory and practice? But how many people can truly put it into practice, especially during this Lunar New Year holiday? In these past few days, everything we have seen and heard has been in accordance with the principle of frugality? It is no wonder that Chairman Chiang and his wife had to rebroadcast the significance of frugality in saving the country on the radio, and informed people in society did not hesitate to tirelessly and repeatedly appeal to the public.</p>
<p>Now, our leader wants us to unite and resist Japan, and we ourselves are determined to unite and resist Japan. Simply put, there is no grand theory to be found; it lies only in our hard work. If anyone forgets, I hope everyone will remind each other. If anyone is not working hard enough, I hope everyone will urge each other. There is no need to sing high-sounding tunes, and there is no need to worry about whether something is ordinary or not!</p>
<h3>Under the Poplar Tree</h3>
<p>— Ya De</p>
<p>As I ran into this alley paved with cobblestones, I saw from afar a poplar tree, more than twenty feet tall, standing straight inside the wall. In the past four years, I have hardly gone a week without seeing this poplar tree, because ever since Little Chen moved into this alley, I have come to visit him every three to five days.</p>
<p>This day, I ran to Little Chen's house as usual, and from afar, I saw that the poplar tree was already shedding its leaves, looking a little haggard. I rang the doorbell at the iron gate.</p>
<p>The iron gate opened, and I ran in. In the courtyard, besides the short and thin Little Chen, there was also a tall man in a blue cloth robe standing under the poplar tree. This tall man had two bright eyes and a fuzzy beard, but it did not hide his youthful appearance.</p>
<p>Little Chen, seeing me staring intently at this unfamiliar guest, smiled and patted my shoulder, introducing him: "Jianren, this is Old Ping, whom I've mentioned to you."</p>
<p>This unfamiliar guest hastily extended his hand, and I mechanically grasped it. Little Chen then spoke to me:</p>
<p>"Old Ping, Jianren is my old classmate. He just came from north of the Yangtze River two days ago... Time really flies. We've been separated for almost eight years now. Looking back on our life eight years ago, it's as if it were yesterday."</p>
<p>Little Chen said ecstatically, and everyone's footsteps slowly moved closer to the poplar tree. The unfamiliar guest used his hand to gently stroke the smooth trunk of the tree.</p>
<p>"Let's go inside the house!" Little Chen pushed us, running forward.</p>
<p>"No," the unfamiliar guest refused, "I love this poplar tree. It's more comfortable for us to stand here. I'm only staying here for two days. After returning to my hometown, no one knows when we'll see each other again."</p>
<p>He said it very naturally, but with some sadness. I wanted to immediately ask him what he was going back to his hometown to do, but I was held back by the silence, and I didn't ask. I only slightly raised my head to look up at this unfamiliar tall man, his eyes gazing at the gray sky, his large hands stroking the trunk of the poplar tree.</p>
<p>"Jianren, what will you do after you return to your hometown?"</p>
<p>Little Chen asked as he took out a cigarette case. We each took one, lit it, and smoked, letting the smoke drift into the sky with the wind.</p>
<p>"Start by training troops." What a loud voice! "I am a person who has escaped death, so I am not afraid of dying... But, for some reason, I fell in love with this poplar tree the moment I saw it. It seems that I am a little reluctant to leave it."</p>
<p>"Ah! You and Old Ping have the same preferences." Little Chen's laughter broke through the solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>I immediately asked, "What does 'escaped death' mean?"</p>
<p>The one who answered was not Jianren, but Little Chen. He said: "Jianren is a 'quick grower.' When Nanjing was abandoned for strategic reasons, he and more than four hundred other soldiers became prisoners of war. Their hands were tied with thick ropes, and they were collectively shot with machine guns. After that, they were stabbed one by one with knives, and then hand grenades were thrown into the pile of corpses. He slept in the corpses, listening to the blood flowing like a waterfall, smelling the strong smell of blood. He didn't think about his life or death. After a long time, he felt that he was still alive, so he struggled to break free from the thick ropes. With knife wounds on his shoulder, he desperately fled in the wilderness, crossed the enemy's line of defense, endured hunger and cold, and finally arrived safely in a guerrilla area after three full days. Because the flames of war had already ignited in his hometown, he decided to go south and return to his hometown to launch guerrilla warfare."</p>
<p>This story was like a fire, burning in my heart; it was also like a poem, and I felt that every word was very stimulating.</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day, we bought a few pounds of wine and some dishes. The three of us sat under the poplar tree, talking and drinking, as a farewell drink for Jianren. Jianren had a very large capacity for alcohol, pouring one cup after another straight down his throat. The more he drank, the more he talked. For some reason, I felt a very warm feeling. I wanted to hug him and kiss him. I loved his eyes and his fuzzy beard.</p>
<p>The moon had already risen, but it was only a small half-moon, like a banana. Jianren looked at the moon, stretching his neck and saying, "Now our peaceful life has disappeared. It will not be restored until after the victory in the war of resistance and the completion of national reconstruction. How much I love a quiet and peaceful life!"</p>
<p>Jianren's words struck our hearts. I lowered my head and said nothing, but Little Chen stared blankly at him. After a long while, Little Chen said:</p>
<p>"Old Ping, Jianren is leaving tomorrow. We have to go to the dock to see him off."</p>
<p>See him off? What I fear most is seeing friends off on long journeys, especially a beloved friend. I immediately firmly refused Little Chen; but I didn't hide it, I honestly said why I didn't want to see him off. I stood up, ran forward to clasp Jianren's hand tightly, and I murmured, "Friend, it seems that we met by chance and very easily, but parting is a little reluctant. But, can I stop you from returning to your hometown? Impossible, impossible!"</p>
<p>Jianren and Little Chen stared at me in surprise. But I stood by the poplar tree as if I had lost consciousness.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Lines of Poetry</h3>
<p>— Shao Sun</p>
<p>Seeing beautiful houses turn to ashes,</p>
<p>Returning swallows cannot find their way home.</p>
<p>Clumps of green grass cover the grave fields,</p>
<p>Where can my cherished loved ones find rest?</p>
<p>Many villages are filled with desolation,</p>
<p>Rabbits roam freely amidst weeds and desolate smoke.</p>
<p>Mud cannot bury the brilliant traces of blood,</p>
<p>The man-eating demon is ferocious everywhere.</p>
<p>Sparse gunfire can be heard in the fields,</p>
<p>The mission of many brave men is being completed.</p>
<p>Every human bomb resists hundreds of artillery shells,</p>
<p>Every head trades for ten enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>This gunfire answers years of accumulated hatred,</p>
<p>Seizing the future's light from scorched earth.</p>
<h3>Shorty: "Old Man, Pass!"</h3>
<p>— Dai Cangqi</p>
<h3>Guessing Germany's "New Books"</h3>
<p>— Wang Yin</p>
<p>A report from the Haitong News Agency states: Germany published the most new books in the world last year, totaling 25,400 volumes.</p>
<p>This is truly worthy of our envy. However, we cannot help but be surprised that: ever since Germany became Hitler's world, we have only heard of continuous book burnings, and the "quantity" of books destroyed was "the highest in the world." How could they suddenly publish so many books?</p>
<p>Naturally, the news report clearly states that they are publishing "new books." After burning the old ones, they cannot but publish new ones. That's right, very correct. But we can't help but ask: what kind of books are these "new books" that were published in such large quantities in one year?</p>
<p>Although we live far away, we have already learned from telegrams what kind of books Germany burned in the past. Although it has not been specified what kinds of "new books" have been published this time, it is not difficult for us to guess a general idea.</p>
<p>Now, let me make a guess and try to create a statistical table of the types of these 25,400 "new books" as follows:</p>
<p>Praising Hitler and the National Socialist Party: 10,000 volumes</p>
<p>Scolding socialism and the Soviet Union: 5,000 volumes</p>
<p>Calling women back to the kitchen: 1,000 volumes</p>
<p>Claiming that Austria is Germany: 3,000 volumes</p>
<p>Saying that the Czech Republic must be protected by Germany: 3,000 volumes</p>
<p>Pointing out that all Jews are bad guys: 3,000 volumes</p>
<p>Discussing that Ukraine has 500,000 Germans: 400 volumes</p>
<p>Total: 25,400 volumes</p>
<p>I dare say that my table is quite accurate.</p>
<p>But if you still want to ask: what is the "number" of readers of these books? That becomes a difficult question to answer. However, it is still possible to guess a general idea. That is: when the "number" of readers is compared to the "number" of books, the phenomenon must also be "the highest in the world."</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>After repeated arguments, Regiment Commander Ye finally softened a little. Coincidentally, Deputy Regiment Commander Liang and Staff Officer Zhu also came to dissuade him, so he no longer insisted and decided to retreat. However, where to retreat to became quite a problem.</p>
<p>"We have now lost contact with the rear, and the east, north, and south sides are all blocked by the enemy. Only the west side, near Taihu Lake, is a dead end for retreat. My idea is to retreat westward, breaking up the formation and turning the regular army into guerrillas. We should disperse and lie in ambush, control the major towns along the railway line, and at the same time, universally organize the armed forces of the people, and then gradually plan for recovery," Deputy Regiment Commander Liang suggested.</p>
<p>"Fighting guerrilla warfare is certainly our only way out from now on, but we also need to find a base of operations," Staff Officer Zhu said with a hint of reminder.</p>
<p>"Then let's retreat to Hepu Town," Regiment Commander Ye breathed a sigh of relief, "Hepu Town is my hometown. It will be easier to supply the army there. Although the place is a bit remote, it is a good base of operations."</p>
<p>Everyone expressed their agreement. The remaining troops were still slightly less than two battalions, so they ordered the weaker battalion to take on the task of covering the front line and retreating while fighting. The elite battalion, along with weapons and baggage, retreated towards Hepu Town in a forced march.</p>
<p>At that time, Hepu Town was being affected by the changes in the war situation and was in a state of anxiety and panic. The old Shenbao newspaper that was ordered by the township office had not arrived for many days, and everyone could not get accurate news, so they had to inquire from each other. Moreover, there were no outstanding and insightful figures in the town to lead, so everyone had no other way but to be anxious.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye arrived with his troops at this time. It had only been ten days since he left home, but the war situation had undergone major changes upon his return. It was truly "the scenery is the same, but the view is different," which made him feel very emotional. When he was about to reach the town, he ordered the troops to temporarily station outside the town to avoid alarming the people. He himself only went to the township office in the town with Deputy Regiment Commander Liang, Battalion Commander Zhao, and Staff Officer Zhu to visit Town Chief Chen Zhaoqian.</p>
<p>Town Chief Chen saw Regiment Commander Ye and three officers coming together, and he knew that the war situation was not good. He panicked for a while and hurriedly asked, "What is the situation at the front?"</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye did not have time to explain to him in detail. He only told him to quickly gather all the people in the town. Town Chief Chen did not dare to delay and hurriedly found the old bronze gong that had been discarded in the dust and ordered the errand boy to knock it outside the door.</p>
<p>"Gong gong gong!" The urgent and loud sound of the bronze gong alarmed all the people in the town. Everyone stopped their work and ran towards the township office. Even Mr. Ye, who did not usually go to the street, slowly strolled over with his water pipe.</p>
<p>"Fangjun," Mr. Ye unexpectedly discovered Regiment Commander Ye in the township office and could not help but call out in surprise. He immediately asked him, "Why are you back? What is the situation at the front?"</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye made a gesture to his father, telling him to wait. He saw that more and more people were coming to the township office, so he started to jump onto a stool and speak to them (17)</p>

<h3>Caused by Feverish Speculation: Shanghai's Distorted Prosperity as an Isolated Island, Flourishing in Appearance but Injured Internally</h3>
<p>The Motivation for Speculation</p>
<p>All Shanghai exchanges were closed after August 13th due to the war. Speculators suddenly lost their dens of speculation. In peacetime, the daily trading value of the securities and cotton yarn exchanges alone was tens of millions of yuan each. Since losing their speculative targets, large amounts of national currency flowed abroad. From the perspective of speculators, this was merely a shift in target objects, but it was still the same speculative style. However, the impact on the country was significant. Their patriotic sentiments were weak, far outweighed by their desire for profit. Observing the fundamental causes, those who were overly sensitive to foreigners feared that the country's wartime financial resources might be insufficient. Thus, the speculation in foreign exchange became rampant.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Speculation</p>
<p>The psychology of speculators in foreign exchange was driven by two factors. First, those who were generally close to foreigners were overly sensitive and apprehensive about the weakening of the nation's wartime finances, leading to inflation or a drop in the market value of national currency. In a single shift, their assets would be protected by changing nationality. At the same time, observing the rise and fall of foreign exchange rates was also conducive to bullish bets. Second, merchants of foreign goods made advance stockpiles. Superficially, this was to guard against losses from exchange rate fluctuations, but in reality, it also contained the same large amount of speculation as the first factor. The rest, such as selling off and arbitrage between currencies of various countries, was equivalent to speculative trading on the exchange. The government then supplied an unlimited amount of foreign exchange to those who needed it, but then restricted it due to the large outflow of national currency. This led to a significant discrepancy in the exchange rates of the same currency between Chinese and foreign banks.</p>
<p>Western Medicine Merchants and the Financial Sector</p>
<p>Since the internal shift of the Shanghai war, Shanghai had become an isolated island. Western medicine merchants, seeing the prolongation of the war, and those with strong capital, rushed to order various medicines from abroad that China did not have but desperately needed. This was done to prepare for shortages and price increases, which would incur losses, as a preemptive measure. This kind of profit, on the one hand, was convenient for patients, and on the other hand, avoided miscalculations in business. Moreover, they gained unexpectedly huge surpluses on exchange rates. During this period, the financial sector saw a massive increase in deposits in various banks due to the gathering of the landed class in Shanghai. These idle funds, in this extraordinary period, had no proper way to be fully utilized to generate profits. Apart from a small portion being used for industry and commercial sector, the majority was tied up in foreign exchange. The amount and surplus depended on their financial strength and vision. Thus, the more profitable ones earned tens of millions in a year, while general small banks, due to a lack of creditworthiness to absorb deposits, not only could not obtain this unexpected profit but were also in danger of collapse. The benefits obtained by other private individuals from foreign exchange are not included in these numbers.</p>
<p>Gold and Currency</p>
<p>Before August 13th, the gold price per bar was eight or nine hundred yuan higher than the current gold price. Before August 13th, the price of foreign banknotes and coins was different from the present, and the increase differed by seventy or eighty percent. The sharp rise was nothing but due to the storage of the landed class. The fervor of speculation was no less than that of foreign exchange. However, one often only had a numerical representation on the contract, while the other was a spot transaction. The common people, however, not only did not enjoy this slightest of rights, but were indirectly harmed by the increase in commodity prices. Those with long sleeves dance well, and are also good at seizing the opportunity.</p>
<p>Government Bonds and Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Although the government bond and cotton yarn markets were suspended after August 13th, their grey market trading gradually sprouted and expanded after the war shifted inland. From irregular, they gradually became regular. Although the amount of trading, restricted by cash, was not as large as when the market was open, it was still considerable. The fluctuation of numbers was about 50-60% of the market price for government bonds and about 40-50% for cotton yarn. The fluctuation of flannel was smaller. This kind of spot speculation or hoarding was mostly superior for those who ran cotton yarn than for government bonds. However, the speculation was mostly done by those who were familiar with this path, each buying and selling according to their inherent vision. However, the scope had already shrunk, and outsiders rarely made a living in this. Therefore, the various yarn factories, because their strength had not been completely destroyed, and those who were able to resume operations, their profits were also far beyond the expectations of ordinary people (see separate article on the cotton yarn industry).</p>
<p>Metals and Building Materials</p>
<p>Due to the war and the difficulty of supply, the price increase of metals was staggering. Green bell, due to special needs and the most felt shortage of goods, the market price gradually soared, and even rose to more than 1,000%, and it was still not easy to get the goods (those who enjoy this kind of right were mostly in the industry and finance sector). The other kinds all varied according to the urgency of their needs, but at least they also rose by 50%. Building materials, with various copper frames, were mostly hoarded by the merchants in the industry, willing to reject customers in order to wait for a good price. Therefore, general ordinary builders often could not obtain the copper frames they needed and could not expand their business. Second, various kinds of wood, the most common of which was western pine, was also not easy to obtain in large quantities. In addition, bricks, tiles, cement, etc., also enjoyed particularly developed businesses due to the rise of new construction. Even transporting broken bricks and tiles from the occupied areas around Shanghai could fetch a good price.</p>
<p>Hotels and Second Landlords</p>
<p>Before August 13th, the hotel industry invariably used price reduction advertisements as a call to action. At the beginning of the war, small hotels were closing or being sold everywhere. After the war shifted inland, the population of Shanghai increased dramatically, and all the hotels were full, and some even secretly increased prices. Some who had a small amount of capital and rented small hotels made profits ranging from one to three times a year. Second landlords who were good at planning, a building or two, could accommodate seven or eight or more tenants in the most common cases. In addition to the second landlord's own residence, they could obtain tens or one or two hundred yuan in unexpected income per month, and the second landlord could still maintain the good name of enthusiastically regulating the housing problems of the general public. Those who had their own houses, the total amount for all tenants ranged from a few hundred yuan to several thousand yuan, for a one-time unexpected irregular gain.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Snack Food Stores</p>
<p>The prosperity of the restaurant business is enough to make one feel sad. In this extraordinary period, more than half of the four million people in Shanghai must be unemployed. Although most people have jobs, most of them can only barely make a living in this high cost of living, and some even do not know what the next day will bring. It would be fitting that this kind of restaurant business should decrease rather than increase. Unexpectedly, what no one expected was that not only did it not decrease, but the increase was even more impressive than before August 13th. Restaurants from various places in the interior that usually had a slight reputation all sought houses for business in the British and French concessions at high prices, dotted all over the place, with no less than a hundred or ten new ones. Most of them were tripling profits, and some even made more than 100,000 yuan in profits in a year. The number of other tea houses and scattered food stores also increased dramatically, and the business was also booming. Among them, tea houses were the most popular. Several large tea houses, such as so-and-so, were always full from morning to night.</p>
<p>The above are just the obvious and eye-catching large examples. The remaining industries, such as silk, tea, fur, and fuel, which are not very necessary, although they also have considerable profits, are not as eye-catching. Even more, the purchase of jewelry at reduced prices and the unclear sources of old goods merchants, their speculative methods are even more despicable and cannot be taken as a model. Those with much wealth are good at buying and selling, and are also good at taking advantage of the deformed development of opportunities. However, the sources of these various profits, a small number come from the supply of the inland landed class, and the majority are the losses suffered by the government. To sum up, the biggest reasons are nothing more than the dramatic increase in population and the extreme shortage of foreign exchange (Kui Wei Sheng).</p>
<h3>Securities: The Digestion of Wartime Government Bonds</h3>
<p>When a country's finances feel that its regular income and economic strength are insufficient due to various special equipment and improvements, issuing government bonds to supplement financial deficits is the most economically sound principle. Because it takes from the people and uses it for the people, there is absolutely no harm in the outflow of rights and interests. Compared to increasing taxes or issuing more banknotes, it is safer and faster. However, the amount of government bonds issued cannot be inexhaustible according to the principle of measuring income and expenditure in national finances. How is the country's source of profit? How is the people's wealth? Beforehand, a careful investigation must be conducted, with the condition precedent that it does not harm the people's livelihood and the development of industry and commerce. Within the scope of possibility, issuing an appropriate amount of government bonds to subsidize the country's legitimate financial needs, then its digestion will surely be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Since the issuance of government bonds in our country since the beginning of the Republic of China, until the reorganization and unification in the 25th year, including the 340 million yuan of recovery bonds issued at the same time, the total is no more than 1800 million yuan (of which the 400 million yuan of the five types of government bonds issued in the 20th year of the Republic of China was the largest). Calculated according to the national population ratio, each person's burden is only 4 yuan. Since August 13th, due to the special needs of the war, as of the end of the 27th year, the government bonds that have been issued are of the following four types:</p>
<p>(A) 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds in the 26th year</p>
<p>(B) Gold bonds in the 27th year, divided into (1) 100 million yuan of customs gold, (2) 50 million US dollars, (3) 10 million pounds sterling, totaling about 550 million yuan in national currency</p>
<p>(C) 500 million yuan of national defense bonds in the 27th year</p>
<p>(D) 100 million yuan of relief bonds in the 27th year</p>
<p>The total amount of the above four types of government bonds is 1.65 billion yuan. In a fiscal year, the amount of government bonds issued is so large, which is certainly a shocking initiative. However, after detailed analysis, it can be known that the number is still limited. For example, the gold bonds in the 27th year are calculated in foreign currency and are not included in the list of domestic government bonds. The national salvation bonds in the 26th year are the people's enthusiastic donations, that is, the people's voluntary national salvation donations. The government is the passive Voltaire national salvation bonds to accept the people's free donations. Therefore, a large part of the matured coupons of the national salvation bonds in the 27th year are still transferred to the government to express their original intention of national salvation donations. Therefore, the above two types of bonds must not be fully included in the scope of domestic government bond issuance. After this analysis, it can be known that in the one and a half years since the War of Resistance, the true domestic government bonds issued are only 600 million yuan, adding the previously issued 1.8 billion yuan, totaling 2.4 billion yuan. The amount borne by the people is only 6 yuan per person. Even including the above two bonds, the amount borne by each person is still only 9 yuan, compared to Japan, with a population of 77 million and a government bond amount of 1.5 billion yuan, with each person bearing 200 yuan in government bonds, which is only slightly less than one-twentieth of it. Assuming that we estimate our national strength at the lowest limit, only one-tenth of Japan's, it can be known that the people of our country still have a government bond digestion capacity of 400-500 million yuan. The people's digestion capacity for government bonds is closely related to their faith in government bonds. To observe the people's faith in government bonds, it can be measured by the rise and fall of the market price of government bonds in the securities market. The following table lists the statistics since August 13th.</p>
<h3>Comparison Table of High and Low Prices Before and After the Suspension of the Unified Government Bonds and Major Records of the Causes</h3>
<p>Looking at the table on the right, it is nothing less than a thermometer of the people's faith in government bonds. The major reasons for the high price of government bonds in the table are nothing more than faith in the final victory of the War of Resistance and the sympathy of countries such as Britain and the United States for our country. Based on the above two basic beliefs, it can be known that the people have extremely strong digestion power for government bonds. The results obtained from this measurement have a very significant impact on politics and economics (Nine).</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Cotton Yarn Industry: Unprecedented Profits: How Wonderful This Time</h3>
<p>The prosperity and development of the cotton yarn industry in the 27th year can be described as unprecedented profits in history, far exceeding the golden age of the European War. All yarn firms and cotton firms can be said to have made money, and everyone had a full pocket. As for the abundance of profits for yarn factories, it is surprising, mostly between six and seven million yuan, (omitted). Therefore, some yarn factories have cleared their bank mortgages, earned back their self-management, and are not subject to any creditor restrictions. The following is a brief description of the booming situation of the cotton yarn industry last year and the profit situation of various parties.</p>
<p>(1) The price of yarn was extremely sluggish in the first half of the year. In the autumn, due to the consistent stance of the War of Resistance, people's hearts were firm and high. The population of the interior gathered in Shanghai, and the Xunhan yarn factories were dismantled and moved to Sichuan. The needs of the interior were all concentrated in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Most of the yarn factories in Shanghai, in the areas invaded by the Japanese army, were destroyed by artillery fire and could not work. Even if they could work, they were operated by the Japanese. Only the Chinese-owned yarn factories in the special zone were still able to work as usual. However, the amount of yarn produced was less than 1,000 bales per day. How could such a small number meet the general demand? The adjustment was uneven, and the market showed a state of demand exceeding supply. As a result, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and West Guangdong were short of goods, and the market price soared step by step. Therefore, the price of a bale of yarn in Sichuan soared to more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(3) The general wealthy, in view of the above situation, the idea of ​​searching and hoarding arose spontaneously. The brokers of the exchange had been idle for more than a year, and they were eager to move after being still. Therefore, they gathered funds to form new cotton yarn firms like mushrooms after a rain. As soon as they entered the market, they immediately dragged in, so the chips in the market felt even more scarce, and the market situation went straight ahead, with new peaks emerging one after another.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese army invaded Guangdong, and Hankou was abandoned again. The main area for cotton yarn sales in South China was lost, and it was hit hard. For a time, it seemed like a torrent of water pouring down, falling to 318 yuan. However, after the price plummeted, the real demand gradually improved. Although Guangzhou fell, the only transportation line to the interior, the Guangjiu Yuehan transportation line, was cut off. However, since the completion of the transportation from the sea defense to Kunming and from there to Chongqing was completed, the agility of transportation was far from what it used to be. The southwest demand increased, and Minnan also came to purchase, and the transportation to Chongqing was not what it used to be. This southwest need increased, and Southern Fujian also came to purchase, and the troops solidified the business in Jiangxi Province, and the Hakka gathered, and eastern Zhejiang purchased, and transported to the rear, and cotton cloth and cotton yarn were especially prosperous, and the market, which had been in decline for a long time, gradually showed signs of recovery. By the end of the year, due to the easing of bank finance, the purchase was even more intense. At the same time, the consumption increased in the southern corner, and the yarn price rose again to more than 400 yuan. Therefore, the yarn industry was uniformly profitable and generous. According to the market, the most yarn firms had 500,000 yuan, 100,000, and 200,000 yuan, and most had 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) To reiterate the situation of cotton, first of all, it was not as good as the yarn market. However, since autumn, although the US-Indian cotton market has fallen one after another, after the "Japanese puppets" implemented control in this port, the inland heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes blocked the source, and the long-term arrival of goods was depleted and slack, and the rising wind was actively advancing. New high prices were created endlessly, and fire machine flowers rose to more than 70 yuan, which is also a new record for the flower industry. Therefore, the flower firms with a little inventory in the first half of the year, spring and summer, all made great profits. The household with the largest profit for the flower firm was more than 700,000 yuan, the middle one was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and there were also several that were just so-so. It can be called a year of fortune for the cotton industry, but it is also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I hope to continue to regenerate in the coming year (Yuan).</p>
<h3>Last Year's Spot Yarn Transaction Situation and Its High and Low Prices</h3>
<p>The actual sales of spot yarn, the total transaction volume in all aspects throughout the year was 190,148 bales, but among them, the transaction volume of hoarders and fellow traders accounted for more than 50%. The most popular, of course, were those in the southwestern non-war zone. The yarn sales within the war zone had been almost completely seized by Japanese yarn. In addition, an investigation of last year's transaction situation showed that the transaction in January and February was the smallest period. After March, it gradually improved with the good situation. The transaction in June had seen an increase. The business in September and December was the most prosperous period of the year. The transaction in mid-October, due to the outrageous price increase and the change of color in Guangzhou, the transaction dropped sharply, a sharp reduction of more than 80% compared with September. Then the price was low, and the north-south war situation was smooth, and it was increasing day by day. The transaction in December was very prosperous, reaching 30,378 bales, which was the largest amount of transaction this year. The following table lists the quantity of transactions in twelve months (unit: bales).</p>
<p>The highest and lowest prices since one year and the price before the holiday are compared as follows for reference.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Shanghai Woolen Industry from a Historical Perspective</h3>
<p>— Zhifeng</p>
<p>Shanghai's woolen industry is the pioneer of the whole of China. At that time, the provinces purchased woolens, and they had to purchase them from Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai's woolen industry is nothing less than the general hub of the national woolen industry. However, there were no formal woolen shops in the Tongzhi period of the former Qing Dynasty. Most of them were brought to China by Westerners for making clothes. Later, the Louis Smore Auction House began to transport a small number of woolens for sale. Because at that time, Shanghai's population and transportation construction, commercial prosperity, were far less than nine-tenths of what they are now. In addition, at that time, most of the money was used, and the standard of living was very low, and woolens had to be sold in silver. Our people did not know the advantages of woolens, thinking that they could only be used by Westerners for clothing. Therefore, there was very little use. By the 28th year of Guangxu, because of the Boxer Rebellion, many people from all over the country came to Shanghai, and an edict was issued to change the law, implement new policies, open schools, and send students abroad. The Shanghai Concession continued to release roads, and the market gradually prospered. Westerners from Europe and the United States also came to Shanghai to open foreign firms. The diplomatic relations were cordial, and merchants gathered. The woolen industry emerged in this era of restoration.</p>
<p>Two or three years before the founding of the Republic of China, woolens became popular among fashionable people because they imitated Europe and the West. Especially people in the academic community, took it for its softness, warmth, wear resistance and non-creasing, suitable for weddings and funerals, men, women, old and young, often wore it as guests, and they were quite generous, unlike silk and satin, which had a rich and noble atmosphere. At the same time, wearing a suit was noble, and the young bosses of foreign firms, that is, the wealthy students studying abroad, expanded the sales. The number of woolen shops on Bai Xing Road and Peng Road increased greatly. In the first year of the Republic of China, the decree to change the clothing system opened up an exclusive market for woolens. Every firm in the industry made thousands or tens of thousands of profits. Therefore, newly opened and branch shops sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, creating a woolen market in the Hongkou district. This time can be said to be the pioneering era of the woolen industry.</p>
<p>As the Shanghai woolen trade developed steadily and the number of people in suits increased day by day, Western clothing tailor shops stood in large numbers, and the overcoat business suddenly flourished. The profits from the business of the U.S. Navy ships were great. The number of woolen shops increased every year, but they were only for Western clothing. Therefore, their business was not yet common. The goods they sold were all double-width, which were not suitable for making Chinese clothing. Therefore, the people in the industry specially set up a special retail store in Qipan Street, selling Chinese clothing materials, marking the price per foot. Its business was very developed. In addition, wholesale shops were opened, distributed in Tao Zhuli, Jingxingli, Wufunong, Xiangfen Lane, Jifuli, Pintang Alley and other places. The woolen sales market seized the position of silk and satin and replaced it. Biji woolen long robes were everywhere. Foreign firms from England, the United States, France, Poland, Germany and Italy also came to Shanghai to open shops at the same time, and transported spot goods for sale. At this time, Chinese camel wool robes were popular throughout Shanghai. On rainy days, a raincoat was worn. This trend flowed into the interior, and the Hakka also came to Shanghai to set up villages to purchase woolens. Therefore, woolen sales markets for both Chinese and Western clothing were available. By then, the industry was also divided into two factions: (1) the Hongkou unpacking gang, (2) the Shanghai Dalubang.</p>
<p>During the European War, the British exchange rate reached eight or nine shillings, and the gold decoration in silver shops was exchanged for 24 yuan per tael. Many of the Hongkou unpacking shops and the booking gang suffered losses. Within one or two years, more than half of them closed down one after another. The Hongkou woolen market almost declined. After this trend passed, most of those who reopened moved to Qipan Street. The woolen shops in Qipan Street gathered more and more, although they closed down from time to time, they closed and opened, and the store base was never empty. The Dalubang promoted Chinese clothing materials in addition to door-to-door sales, and most of them also operated Western clothing sets. The only difference was the samples. In this way, every year the sales increased by one year. The northern gang, the Sichuan gang, the Guangdong-Fujian gang, and the Dalian gang successively expanded their purchase of woolens. The woolen industry in Shanghai was prosperous, and the strength of the Qipan Street woolen gang surpassed the Hongkou gang. The Woolen Industry Association also moved from Xia Hai to Shanghai. This time can be said to be the era of recovery after the European War.</p>
<p>In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition was unified, and the capital was established in Nanjing. Sun Yat-sen's suit was popular. At the same time, people from military, political, academic, and business circles specially increased the number of people wearing suits. Most of those wearing Chinese clothes also used woolen products. Cities and villages had a large number of purchases. The number of brokers and street runners suddenly increased. Qipan Street almost became a large woolen market. Because of the many shops, complete colors, fair prices, and friendly hospitality, it was more convenient to choose, evaluate each other, Shanghai's general foreign goods stores and silk and satin stores mostly also sold woolens in order to facilitate customers' purchases. If it were not so, the business would be hit. It can be called the prosperous era of the woolen industry.</p>
<p>The woolen gang on Qipan Street can now represent the entire Shanghai woolen market. In addition to purchasing high-end and excellent woolens from unpacking shops to get samples, ordinary people need Chinese and Western clothing materials, and they all come to Qipan Street to choose and purchase. Among them, except for three or five that are really not two prices, most of them have to bargain to get real cheap goods. The shops often hold large discounts during the peak sales period in spring and autumn. In the afternoon, each store has the hard work of not being able to entertain. It is even worse on Sundays. The 27th year was even more lively, which shows that the population of various roads in the isolated island is concentrated, and the expansion of consumption is also unexpected by the woolen industry in the 26th year.</p>
<p>In the era of commercial warfare, the woolen industry also competed with each other to attract customers. Among them, the sales of woolen products can also be divided into three periods: (1) In the initial pioneering era, British goods accounted for the top spot, (2) In the recovery era, French, German, American, Italian and Polish goods were in high demand. Although British goods still accounted for the top spot, there was a great shake, (3) In the prosperous era, our country's products were successively born, struggling to sell well, unfortunately, inferior goods were dumped, and they were hit a lot. In recent years, the domestic woolen factories, buyers and sellers, have adhered to the uncompromising tenet, always firmly believed in the highest industry association, and tried their best to promote sales. With a fearless spirit, they repelled inferior goods and tenaciously fought a protracted war. The final victory must belong to us.</p>
<h3>Finance: Little Change in the Exchange Market at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>On February 18 (last Saturday), the exchange market only traded for half a day. The market was calm and stagnant, completely filled with pre-holiday atmosphere. Initially, the bank's selling price was 8 pence 125 for British gold and 15.875 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was longer by 1 centime and 1875 for the British and American exchange rates compared with the previous closing British average US loose 03125, After opening, foreign firms and foreign banks settled. However, telegrams from Hong Kong and other places were sold to be favorable (on behalf of a bank in North China). Chase Holland shillings 8 pence 125. Another US dollar of 15.875 yuan was issued. After the US bank absorbed it, it resold it to foreign firms for 15.8125 yuan. Therefore, it was once hard to shillings 8 pence 140625. US exchange rate of 15.90625 yuan, both can be settled. Although Hong Kong exchange rate, foreign banks and Anda absorbed, but the money exchange industry also had good selling intentions, so the situation was not much changed. At noon, the bank's selling price was 8 pence 125 for British gold and 15.875 yuan for the US exchange rate. As a result, the previous closing British average US was loose 03125. The Hong Kong exchange rate was neither honored nor disgraced, and it was still 54.375 yuan. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<h3>During the Winter Vacation, There Were No Transactions in the Gold Market. There Were Only Buyers and No Sellers</h3>
<p>On February 18 (Saturday), the gold market was closed due to the winter vacation. Only a few members came to the market to buy and sell, so the Hong Kong gang had no way to search for purchases. At the same time, the buyers wanted to purchase at about 20823 yuan, but the sellers were reluctant to move forward, so there was no transaction. The gold decoration in silver shops was not changed, and the old firm, such as Lao Qingyun, still hung the original price of 211 yuan. The new firm also still hung 209 yuan, and received 203 yuan.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the God of Wealth</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>The purpose of welcoming the God of Wealth is entirely selfish. Therefore, some people consider this behavior not only ridiculously superstitious but also shamefully foolish. However, the business community's welcoming of the God of Wealth contains another layer of meaning. Originally, a year's business operations are meant to start on this day of the God of Wealth, after this kind of ceremony. Therefore, stores and businesses take the ceremony of welcoming the God of Wealth very seriously, and the rituals are also very solemn. On the late night of the fourth day of the old Lunar New Year, on the one hand, the list of attendees for the worship is drawn up, which determines personnel changes. On the other hand, they discuss the business situation of the past year and future strategies, announcing new goals. Because of this, the practice of welcoming the God of Wealth continues to thrive in the business world.</p>
<p>According to news from various sources, the final reports of the business community in this city for the last period all show profits. The best performing was the yarn industry, with some earning five or six million; the piece goods industry certainly earned over a million; other industries varied, with tens of thousands or fifty thousands, all looking better compared to previous years. Tonight, welcoming the God of Wealth will naturally be even happier and more enthusiastic than before, and the display will certainly be more extravagant and noisier, hoping to receive the blessing of the God of Wealth to protect their industry and business, to make it even more prosperous and profitable. However, we feel that the reason why the isolated island's business community was able to make a profit last year was not the blessing of the God of Wealth, but the grace of the God of War. If it were not for the God of War driving the population of the mainland to gather here and devastating the mainland's production, there would not be such an abnormally prosperous situation today. Precisely because of this, the essence of this prosperity is very fragile and very illusory, and this superficial prosperity still conceals the crisis of the isolated island's business community's future. It is like a person after an illness; although the body is fat, it is swollen, not truly strong. The evolution of edema is very dangerous.</p>
<p>If the ceremony of welcoming the God of Wealth is truly the time to decide on new business strategies, then we hope that business people will no longer be attached to this isolated island with its polluted air and dark surroundings, and should plan to invest in the mainland to develop our infinite wealth. They must understand that when the situation of the isolated island is no longer isolated, the current false prosperity will wither away, and besides, devils surround us, seizing and exploiting at will, which will be an unavoidable calamity!</p>
<h3>Xiang Yu, the Conqueror</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Historical films are not reproductions of historical records, so slight adaptations are permissible, and sometimes even necessary. But this "permissible" or "necessary" should be based on a new historical perspective, using it selectively and critically. Otherwise, it will be like putting a cow's head on a horse's body, turning it into a case of gilding the lily or making a tiger resemble a dog, which would be a joke.</p>
<p>Therefore, the difficulty of historical films (so-called "period dramas") lies not only in the research of costumes and props and the grand scale of the scenes but also in the viewpoint of the creators. There will inevitably be the creator's subjectivity, and therefore there can be no ambiguity. The news editor should be the most "objective," but in the size of the headline and the prominence of the position, he still cannot escape his likes and dislikes and the reflection of his awareness of a certain piece of news. As an art form, can a film truly be detached and become a "third person"?</p>
<p>Therefore, our basic attitude toward the production of historical films is not so much the issue of how faithful to historical facts, but rather how to critically accept the lessons of history from the standpoint of the Chinese people today.</p>
<p>Director Wang Yuanlong has made it very clear about the theme of "Xiang Yu, the Conqueror": "Because we want to make the story conform to modern trends, we use Xiang Yu and Liu Bang as examples. One is a warmonger and militarist, while the other advocates peace and benevolence. As a result, the former failed and the latter succeeded. This is the theme of 'Xiang Yu, the Conqueror.'"</p>
<p>"Warmongering and militarism" and "benevolence and peace" are aimed at the current situation in China and also at the current world situation. "The benevolent prosper, the hegemon perishes," is originally an unchanging truth, but on the issue of "advocating war" and "advocating peace," we still need to add a precise annotation. Otherwise, Yue Fei, who "advocated war," became a villain for all time, while Qin Hui, who "advocated peace," became a hero for eternity. At a time when the likes of Jingwei use selling out the country as an excuse for "peace," and Eastern fascists with mouths full of "benevolent governance" who advocate war cannot step down, and many hope for "peace" to protect their loot, simply talking about "advocating war" and "advocating peace" in terms of words alone is truly in danger of becoming the "tail" of the aggressors. I imagine that the original intention of the filmmakers would not be like this.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding "peace" and "war," we should really look at it further.</p>
<p>After the Eastern fascists' "punitive expeditions" failed and their "purge" became hopeless, the new policy they implemented in Jiangnan was a policy of appeasement, which is to buy people's hearts. The so-called policy of appeasement, when exposed, is actually not worth half a cent. On the one hand, they instigate Han traitors to collect exorbitant taxes and levies, using both soft and hard tactics to gather grain and other supplies, and then, they come forward to transport some of the grain from area A to area B for "relief," pretending to be a "righteous army." This kind of trickery is seemingly the ultimate in "benevolence and peace," but in reality... anyway, very few people will know about this trick.</p>
<p>And is this kind of "benevolence and peace" really "benevolence and peace"?</p>
<p>"Xiang Yu, the Conqueror" uses the "victory of benevolence and peace" and the "failure of warmongering and militarism" as its theme, which is originally very good. But the regret lies precisely here: it only talks about the surface and does not make a further dissection, and this is not enough.</p>
<p>We sympathize with the filmmakers' painstaking efforts, and we admire such a solemn theme, but at the same time, precisely because of this time and place, we cannot help but demand perfection to prevent misinterpretations. -- If such a play were to be publicly shown in the occupied areas, then such defects should be prevented even more.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, I would like to use an example to discuss it:</p>
<p>"Xiang Yu advanced into Xianyang, ignoring the advice of the crowd, killed the Qin Prince Ziying, and slaughtered tens of thousands of people in Xianyang." After that, there is a scene on the screen of a woman from the people plotting to enter Xiang Yu's tent to assassinate the conqueror. This scene is very important, and what the woman from the people said is even more worthy of our attention. She said: "After the people overthrew the King of Qin, what they hoped for was an army of benevolence and peace, but who knew that as soon as the conqueror arrived in Xianyang, he slaughtered countless people... so the families of those killed formed an alliance, forged daggers, and sent her into the tent to plot the assassination, to avenge the people who were killed..." (roughly like this). This scene, in terms of the "theme," certainly fits the "theme" and shows that the people cannot be underestimated. However, in our view, we feel that such a "theme" still needs to be clearly indicated. First, we should correctly and clearly indicate who the enemy of the people is. Second, we must fix the enemy, so as not to mistakenly regard the brutal and cruel enemy as an army of benevolence and peace and place hopes of affection on them. In this situation, we can only emphasize the "theme" from the standpoint of the Chinese people today to warn the vacillating, compromising, and backward people. If this theme is not clearly expressed, it may lead to many regrets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, "Xiang Yu, the Conqueror" did not do it clearly and one hundred percent.</p>
<p>In other aspects, in terms of script writing and the director's handling, it seems that because too much emphasis was placed on a few major scenes, the transitional scenes were neglected, so that people have the feeling of watching a Beijing opera-like "Complete Story of the Chu-Han Contention," forming a continuous feeling of old plays one after another. This is certainly because there is too much historical material and it is not easy to handle, but it is also because the playwright focused too much on the individual courage of the conqueror. History is not created by individuals; too much emphasis on the individual and neglecting his environment and evolution is also a dangerous thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is because the playwright was influenced by Beijing opera (the difficulty of filming period dramas is also how to jump out of the influence of Beijing opera), so in the division of scenes, it unconsciously created this situation, and the same is true in the writing of dialogue and the actors' movements and lines.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong's Xiang Yu is admirable in his roughness, but his heroic spirit of uprooting mountains is still not enough, especially his heroic posture on horseback, because his physique is not good enough to portray this great hero of an era. Jin Suqin's Yu Ji has few scenes, and perhaps because it is her first time on camera, she is not amazing. Several others also seem to have questionable qualities.</p>
<p>The most commendable thing about this play is the grandeur of the scenes. From this point of view, it can be seen that no expense was spared, but because the enemy and ourselves are not clearly distinguished enough, so although a lot of money was spent, we still cannot feel very satisfied.</p>
<p>Filming period dramas has its special advantages, which lie in using the past to warn the present, and from the perspective of the Chinese people at this time and place, "Xiang Yu, the Conqueror" is not enough to make people feel satisfied.</p>
<h3>Happy News</h3>
<p>— Mo Dian</p>
<p>I received your letter on New Year's Eve. The traditional Lunar New Year in Shanghai is busier than the Gregorian New Year; it hasn't changed after being called an "isolated island"; perhaps even more so. According to reports, all industries have had large surpluses; you can imagine the prosperous state of Shanghai after two years of separation. But old friends remain the same; my writing income is not enough to support my family. On New Year's Eve, I was still struggling with urgent matters, aimlessly running around, and almost took the "Hong Kong tram" to welcome the God of Happiness, going to the police station to "stay up all night."</p>
<p>This is naturally just my personal matter and has nothing to do with New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>The shops on Nanjing Road have extended their business hours, and the crowds in the candy shops are daunting; just after eight o'clock, the movie theaters have already posted "Sold Out" signs; the dance halls are naturally packed; crowds of people stand on the streets. I wonder, what are they watching?</p>
<p>Back home, there is the sound of mahjong everywhere, which seems to be a necessary decoration for "passing the New Year."</p>
<p>Forgive me for being unsophisticated; perhaps because I'm poor, I take the opportunity to stretch out and fall asleep in bed; this is still considered fortunate compared to you.</p>
<p>When I woke up on the first day of the New Year, the first sound that entered my ears was still the sound of mahjong. I don't know if they played all night or if they had special early showings like movie theaters? In short, this spirit is admirable!</p>
<p>But the weather is not good; it's raining. I could have rested for a day, but there were still some unfinished matters to clarify with a friend from the other night. My family didn't prepare glutinous rice balls or lotus seeds, so I left the house on an empty stomach as usual.</p>
<p>I ran into the landlady in the kitchen. She was lighting incense and candles, worshiping the Buddha. When she saw me, she smiled a rare smile and wished me a happy new year, asking if I was visiting relatives. I didn't know how to answer her; I probably just nodded as a greeting. If there is any happy news this year, it will be her rare smile.</p>
<p>I had lunch at my friend's house. My friend's wife wanted to go to the movies and invited me to go with them. Because we are close friends, they often treat me, so I honestly went along. But strangely enough, both movie theaters we went to were "Sold Out," and tickets for the 5:30 show were not available; you had to plan to watch the 9:00 movie at 2:00 in the afternoon. We don't have that kind of leisurely temperament. It was raining again, so I said goodbye to my friend and left.</p>
<p>It's rare to have a day off, but it feels too empty. Should I go home? It's too disappointing to spend the first day of the New Year in such a cold and lonely place. So, I wandered in the rain like a ghost, unable to make up my mind.</p>
<p>Originally, although I don't have any relatives in Shanghai, I have many friends, but they wouldn't be as idle as me. People with families have to visit various places, and even if I could find a kindred spirit by chance, it wouldn't be right to go and chat on a rainy day on the first day of the New Year. Fortunately, I suddenly had an idea. I bought a newspaper and sat down in the lobby of a newly opened movie theater. There were water fountain facilities and comfortable sofas. I lit a cigarette and looked at the newspaper and the dull film, as if waiting for a lover... I slipped out when the 5:30 movie started, because the doorman in the royal uniform seemed to be paying attention to me.</p>
<p>By this time, the street lights were on, but the streets were very quiet. I found a small restaurant on Edinburgh Road that was still open, so I squeezed in and sat with those "friends" wearing crooked hats, ordered some wine, had a hearty meal, and then collapsed on the bed again when I got home.</p>
<p>I have told you frankly how I spent this New Year, although I haven't described my state of mind, but old friends can easily guess from between the lines.</p>
<p>Today I went back to work as usual and felt refreshed; I guess I was just born to be poor! However, I feel that people really have to "work." People like you would never let these few days go to waste, and in your group, you not only "work" on the things at hand, but also desperately find things to "work" on.</p>
<p>If there is any happy news this year, it will definitely come from you.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Tracing the Past, Le Tian Conveys Wonderful Words; Forming New Friendships, a Pleasant Trip to a Scenic Spot</p>
<p>The second piece of domestic news was also very unique. It was that China and the Soviet Union had agreed to a trade agreement in which China would exchange tea worth 50 million yuan with the Soviet Union for kerosene of the same value each year. This "barter" method was popular in primitive times. It is the so-called exchanging what you have for what you don't have, which initially occurred between individuals. For example, if you have cloth and I have rice, I would exchange rice for your cloth. Conversely, if you want something else, you can also exchange it with people; that is the beginning of trade. Unexpectedly, this barter system has now become popular internationally. Because China has also mined several kerosene mines in recent years, the actual demand is huge. It is simply impossible to rely solely on domestically produced kerosene. According to the current situation, 30% is from domestically produced kerosene, 40% is from American kerosene, and 30% is still lacking, so we must use Soviet-produced kerosene. Fortunately, Chinese tea is also exported to the Soviet Union in large quantities, so this exchange agreement was signed. Others didn't care when they heard this news, but the He sisters paid attention. They thought: This was announced after Father went to Beiping. He had already made contact when Father was in Shanghai; that was also one of the many events after their father went north. At this time, Liyu looked at Shuangyu, and Shuangyu also nodded. Everyone understood, but it was not convenient to say it out loud. In addition to these two pieces of domestic news, which were relatively important, the rest were very trivial. After reporting the domestic news, they reported international news. The important international news was that the Third Disarmament Conference would be held on January 10th next year. Hasn't the Disarmament Conference been going on for twenty or thirty years? In the past, there was a Disarmament Conference this way and a Disarmament Conference that way. This year there is a Disarmament Conference, and next year there is a Disarmament Conference. After opening and opening, as a result, the Disarmament Conference has become an Arms Expansion Conference. This time, it is a real Disarmament Conference. The countries have had a drink together and said everything is open. What can't be overcome? Therefore, on January 10, 1952, the Third Disarmament Conference will be held in Washington, D.C. The first thing is that no country is allowed to manufacture bomber aircraft anymore. All previous military aircraft will be converted for civilian use. Those that cannot be converted for civilian use will be destroyed. Also, those who manufacture poison gas bombs, no matter how much of a chemical doctor or inventor you are, if you produce that kind of poison gas that harms humanity from now on, you will be publicly recognized as a criminal of the world, and you can be detained wherever you go.

<h3>Xin Yanqiu Sacrifices Herself for the Country</h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Peiping, 20th: According to reliable Chinese sources, the female actress Xin Yanqiu (transliteration) attempted to assassinate Miao Bin at Jixiang Theater several weeks ago, but failed, and Guan Zhenglin (transliteration) died on the spot. Shortly after, Xin Yanqiu was arrested by the Japanese military police and has since died in prison.</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu, whose surname is Wang and given name is Yuhua, is from Peiping. Her father, Wang Haishan, is a very kind person. Her older brother, Zixiang, once studied the huqin with Xu Lanyuan, and when he succeeded, he played the instrument for his sister. Yuhua is intelligent and beautiful, with a heroic spirit in her eyes, so she is most brilliant in portraying "Hong Fu" and "Yu Ji." The martial arts master Yang Xiaolou rarely performed with female actresses in his life, but he uniquely paired Yuhua with Yu Ji in the play "Farewell My Concubine," which shows the transcendence of her art. Yuhua's singing style is based on Cheng Yanqiu, and her appearance is also somewhat similar to Cheng, so she was named Xin Yanqiu. Later, she studied drama with the famous actress Wang Yaoqing, and her attainments became even deeper. Ten years ago, three female actresses came to Shanghai from Peiping to perform at the same time. One was Xue Yanqin at the Grand Stage, the second was Liu Yanqin at Tianchan, and the third was Xin Yanqiu at Dan Gui First Stage. The three beauties competed, and their skills were commendable, far surpassing the previous generation of female actresses who valued appearance over art. Among the three, Xue Yanqin excelled in voice, Xin Yanqiu excelled in singing style, and Liu Yanqin excelled in martial arts. Within a few years, Xue was taken as a concubine by Puyi's cousin, Liu disappeared after leaving Shanghai, and only Xin Yanqiu continued to perform from time to time after returning to Peiping. Yan Jupeng, Wang Youchen, and others also successively supported her (i.e., as the lead male role), so her reputation rose sharply, and she was recognized as the chief of the female roles. Four or five years ago, she was suddenly favored by a young division commander of the Central Army, who spent thousands of gold to buy her a new car, which she often drove around the downtown areas in front of and outside the city. Among the old Beijing actors who had their own cars, there were only a few people such as Lian Liang, Xiao Yun, and Shuyan. Others, such as Cheng Yanqiu, used chartered cars instead. Therefore, Yuhua's possession of a car was quite surprising to her peers. Rumors arose for a time, and everyone said that she would give up her acting life and marry the division commander. Later, it was heard that the conditions in her family were very harsh, and they would not agree to the marriage without a hundred thousand silver dollars, so the matter was stopped. This report says that Yuhua attempted to assassinate Miao Bin in Jixiang Garden in the Eastern District, but was arrested by the Japanese military police and died in prison. According to general speculation, Yuhua had a very deep relationship with a young division commander of the Central Army, and she was influenced by him day and night. Her patriotism would certainly not lag behind others. Seeing Miao and others lose their minds and willingly recognize the enemy as their father, it may have touched her sense of righteousness, and she wished to imitate the actions of heroic women such as Hong Fu, so she made a surprising move, adding a unique color to the acting world, or she was imprisoned on suspicion, resulting in her demise. As for the real reason, we can only wait for future investigations. (The above is a photo of her in the play "Farewell My Concubine" taken four years ago.)</p>
<h3>Robin Hood</h3>
<p>— Jia Feng</p>
<p>The heroic Robin Hood is an invincible archery general, a skilled swordsman, very romantic, cheerful, and amiable. He is a famous and active figure in modern times, as he was in the centuries before Sir Walter Scott and Owen. In fact, now he is even more popular than before, because Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, two famous stars, have filmed this active and lovable character.</p>
<p>But is there really this brave warrior in the world? Some will be surprised to ask us such a question. Of course, in fact, this lovable bandit cannot be found in official history, except in ballads and storybooks.</p>
<p>The first mention of Robin Hood was in William Langland's collection of poems published in 1377. Then, Wyntoun's Scottish History also mentioned him. Since then, the legends and anecdotes about this brave outlaw and his subordinates have been spread more and more widely and become more and more complicated. In Walter Scott's "Ivanhoe", Robin Hood is the hero of the book. He first appears under the names of Yeoman Locksley and the archer Locksley, and finally, he meets the world under his old name, Robin Hood.</p>
<p>Some historians and novelists, although they know that historical data is still needed to verify it, always feel that Robin Hood was a real person.</p>
<p>People think that Robin Hood appeared in Sherwood Forest in England during the time of King Richard the Lionheart. This was the era when the local Saxons were oppressed by the Norman victors who succeeded William the Conqueror. They conquered this country in 1066.</p>
<p>According to the stories passed down from earlier years, Robin Hood's career was robbing the rich and helping the poor. At first, people assumed that he came from a poor family, but as the story spread year after year, people felt that he was too good, so the storytellers said that he came from a noble family. Recently, in Warner Bros.' film, his real name is Earl of Locksley.</p>
<p>It is interesting how Hollywood has selected and rejected the legends of Robin Hood. Fairbanks wrote a forty-four-word outline on a piece of paper for his production. The Warner Bros. research department did a lot of research on this. The research department studied the records of this figure for four or five years. The scriptwriters Ryan and Miller for Flynn read all the popular materials about Robin Hood, then threw away their notes and made a story that happened to be the same as Fairbanks's.</p>
<h3>A Play Critic's Conversation About the Role of Empress Dowager Xiao in "Qian Qian Studio Theatre Talks"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Chen Delin is a leading figure among female impersonators since the Republic of China era. His singing adheres to old methods and does not seek novelty. However, the audience below the stage praises his skills and never tires of the old ways. This is because his voice and singing method possess true power and skill, allowing him to stand tall in the era of new female impersonator tunes. Recently, Mr. Zheng Guoyi, in Xinwenbao (News Daily), discussed Yanmenguan (Yanmen Pass), praising Wang Yaoqing's vivid portrayal of Empress Dowager Xiao in the play. Yaoqing's delivery was sharp and decisive, unlike anything else. His demeanor and bearing were also unique, elegant and generous, beyond the reach of ordinary actors. I, like Mr. Zheng Guoyi, admire both Delin and Yaoqing's singing and acting and consider them outstanding talents in the opera world. However, Mr. Zheng Guoyi has not seen Delin's Empress Dowager Xiao. Therefore, at the repeated request of Mr. Huang Jiping of this newspaper, I have written this article to share my thoughts with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Chen Delin's role as Empress Dowager Xiao in "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Orders" was almost exclusively his in the old capital. In grand ceremonial performances, "Visiting the Mother" was often the final act. Therefore, those who resided in Beijing for a long time all knew that Delin's Empress Dowager Xiao was unrivaled in the opera scene. His dialogue was undoubtedly excellent, and his dignified and solemn bearing was particularly outstanding. It is said that because he served in the inner court, he gained a deep understanding of the demeanor and gestures of noble Manchu women, allowing him to perfectly embody the character. How could ordinary people easily emulate him?</p>
<p>Before the tenth year of the Republic of China, Wang Yaoqing never played the role of Empress Dowager Xiao. This was because there was already a master ahead, and he did not want to compete with Delin for a single day's advantage. Yaoqing's sharp and decisive delivery was his strength, but his voice still retained some male tones, which was his only weakness. Delin's Beijing accent was clear and powerful, and he could perfectly mimic the voice of Manchu women, surpassing Yaoqing in this aspect. Delin's allegro sections in "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Orders" were considered the best among female impersonators because his articulation was clear, and his voice was round and smooth. The faster he sang, the more exquisite it became, similar to Lao Tan's allegro. Delin's possession of these two advantages made him superior to Yaoqing. Moreover, Delin's demeanor and bearing were also superior to Yaoqing. Therefore, when discussing Empress Dowager Xiao, Chen Delin must be considered the ultimate performer. Furthermore, the dialogue between the Empress Dowager and the princess in "Visiting the Mother and Returning to the Orders" required perfect synchronicity and seamless execution. Even the slightest hesitation would ruin the performance. Delin's performance in this section was highly acclaimed. After Delin and Yaoqing, Wu Caixia and Luo Furong Cao were the most praised contemporary performers. Caixia purely adhered to the old methods, while Tongshan modeled himself after Delin. Shanghai praised Tongshan's Empress Dowager Xiao in "Visiting the Mother." In reality, Tongshan's Manchu costume and stage steps still revealed traces of affectation, lacking the pure and natural grace of Delin. There was a clear difference in quality. I am not making this assessment because Delin has passed away, to shock the world. Rather, I am offering an unbiased opinion on the art of the two performers. I believe those who have frequently listened to Delin's Empress Dowager Xiao will agree with my fair assessment.</p>
<p>In the winter of the third year of the Republic of China, I attended a charity performance organized by the Beijing Opera Association in the old capital at the Tianle Theatre, where I saw Chen Delin, Yunfu, Wang Yaoqing, Lu Sanbao, Hu Suxian, Jia Honglin, Jin Zhongren, Wang Huifang, and others perform "Yanmenguan" (a scene from "Northern and Southern Harmony"). Delin as Empress Dowager and Lao Yunfu as She Taijun were equally matched in skill and could be considered the heavenly voices of this opera. Later, at the Xinming Grand Theatre, Mei Lanfang staged the complete "Yanmenguan," with Delin, Yunfu, Wang Fengqing, Zhu Suyun, Qian Jinfu, Wang Changlin, Xun Huisheng, Zhu Guifang, Li Shoushan, Jiang Miaoxiang, and other actors as supporting roles. It was also a grand occasion. I only managed to attend one performance and still regret not seeing the entire play.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Shanghai's Peking Opera Theatres During the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Since closing their doors last winter, Shanghai's Peking Opera theatres have completed their internal reorganization and adjustments to their casts. All reopened on the first day of the lunar new year, to enhance the festive atmosphere. A reporter visited the backstage areas of each theatre and now presents the observed grandeur as follows:</p>
<p>Golden Theatre: Zhang Eyun, the northern-style female impersonator and respected figure, has long been admired by the people of Shanghai for her beauty and artistry. This time, she is performing with the support of Yang Baosen, Ye Shengli, Liu Lianrong, Ma Fulu, and others, creating a harmonious blend of talent. Those who are captivated by Eyun are flocking to see her, resulting in sold-out performances every day and excellent results.</p>
<p>Carlton Theatre: The Yi Feng Theatre Company originally planned to rehearse the two-part "Wen Suochen" during the break, but the time was too short. Since reopening, they plan to perform old plays for half a month and then rehearse new plays. Opera fans have deep faith in the company. Before New Year's Eve, they rushed to book seats, selling out all tickets from New Year's Day to the God of Wealth Day. Zhou Xinfang can truly be called the "authority of the Peking Opera world."</p>
<p>Gong Wu Tai Theatre: The play "Red Lotus Temple" has deeply resonated with the audience and has a very strong appeal. On New Year's Day night, they premiered the 29th installment of the new play. With the addition of martial arts actor Yuan Xiaolou, Huang Baoyan, and child actor Xiao Xiaoshentong, the cast is even stronger. Therefore, at nine o'clock in the morning, audience members were already buying tickets to enter, and by eleven-thirty, the iron gates were tightly closed, with hundreds being barred from entry. Many waited until the end of the day's performance to gain entry. The theatre's splendor was truly unmatched by any other theatre. The front of the theatre was decorated with a full view of the burning of the Red Lotus Temple, which was quite eye-catching and an excellent tool for attracting the audience.</p>
<p>Da Wu Tai Theatre: Monkey King Zhang Yipeng had once expressed a desire to retire. However, after the authorities earnestly persuaded him to stay, he dispelled his intentions and continued to perform on stage from New Year's Day. The 32nd installment of "Journey to the West C," which premiered the night before last (the second day of the new year), had special contributions in terms of plot and technique. Moreover, the authorities provided extremely magnificent scenery and prizes made of four thousand taels of gold, creating an unprecedented record of ticket sales. Yipeng will be adding the play "Dang Peng Beats Zou Wannianchun" in the 33rd installment, which has profound significance and is being actively rehearsed.</p>
<p>Tianchan Theatre: Famous dan Huang Duqiu and sheng Gu Shaohua performed together. Martial arts actors Wang Duqing and Wang Fuying, who had left the Gong Wu Tai Theatre, also joined the troupe, and the cast was well-organized and not inferior to other theatres. However, due to excessively high ticket prices and the exorbitant demands of the tea servers, the audience was hesitant to attend, resulting in mediocre business, which was unexpected. It was not until the past two nights, when Huang Duqiu and Gu Shaohua performed "Yu Tang Chun" and "Si Lang Visits His Mother," that the theatre was finally sold out. Opera fans have a very good reputation for Gu Shaohua.</p>
<p>Queen Theatre: One of the masters of southern-style short-play martial arts, Gai Jiaotian, after being strongly encouraged by famous amateur actor Yu Yung, came out of retirement with his young son Guan Fu (stage name Xiao Gai Jiaotian) and joined the Queen Theatre. Although the scale is small, most of the audience members are highly respected people, and opera fans gather here. The expenses of the backstage and front stage are very low, and profits are guaranteed.</p>
<p>Kade Theatre: The theatre was reorganized and taken over by Yongji Zhongyuan Company. In addition to famous actors Xiao San Mazi, Guo Yurong, Xin Yanqiu, Wang Guiwu, Zhao Yunhe, and others, they also negotiated with Zhang Yipeng and hired his third brother Yupeng (stage name Erpeng) to perform as the mainstay of the theatre. Yupeng has a deep family background and his art is comparable to that of his father and brothers. After taking the stage, he received extremely high praise and made a sensational debut, which was expected. Some say that with the Gai family's father and sons all coming out of retirement, the Shanghai opera scene is dominated by their family, which is no exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Interests of Performers</h3>
<p>— KS</p>
<p>In the film industry, whenever someone mentions the name "Mei Ran Gong" (Mr. Beautiful Beard), everyone will think of Gao Lihen with his face full of whiskers. It is said that the reason he puts this very annoying thing on his beautiful face is because there is a reason, and the inside story of this reason is an unspeakable secret! He is from Sichuan, and his Shanghai dialect with a Sichuan accent has caused many jokes. As a result, female stars often misunderstand him and quarrel with him! He loves spicy food, and a jar of spicy pickles is a staple dish in his home all year round!</p>
<p>The one who specializes in playing "Mr. Wang" is Tang Jie. His performing art surpasses his directing technique, which means that he is less likely to succeed in directing than in performing! Years ago, he had a habit of reading comics. He would read everything with comics in newspapers and magazines before he was satisfied. However, he most admired Ye Qianyu's "Mr. Wang." He felt that "Mr. Wang's" actions and deeds were not only very interesting but also exposed the ills of all levels of society. Therefore, when he worked at Tianyi Film Company, he introduced "Mr. Wang" to Shao Zuiweng and suggested filming it. At the same time, he also advocated playing "Mr. Wang" himself. As a result, his proposal became a reality. Therefore, on the eve of filming, in order to seek realism, he did not hesitate to shave off his full head of black hair and even painfully pull out two beautiful front teeth.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua, known as the "Second Hu Die," was originally an unimportant actor in Wen Yimin's Jianghua Company. However, women sell beauty for money. After leaving Jianghua, Diao Banhua finally had a smooth career and became a red star. She has the naive temperament of a child. Because she is naive, she regards everything as child's play. For example, love; she has no understanding of it. She feels that everyone is lovable, but she cannot distinguish the lovable aspects of her object. Therefore, again and again, she has made many jokes; and the jokes have affected her future!</p>

<h3>Isolated Island Drama Talk</h3>
<p>— Wang Weiwuo</p>
<p>I Talk About the Qi School</p>
<p>Talking about the Qi School is not an easy task. It is not that one cannot write without in-depth research on this school. Si Jun's article on the "Qi School" earlier inevitably had some aspects that were difficult to sympathize with. Now, let's put aside Zhou Xinfang, the master of the Qi School, and talk about the people who are currently studying the Qi School. Although Gao Baisui has the best status and reputation, realistically speaking, the person who will inherit Xinfang's mantle in the future should be none other than Wang Chunbai.</p>
<p>Wang Chunbai, originally named Wang Yunsen, came from a martial arts background (that is, what the opera troupe calls "hitting the target"). He once hung the top sign at the New New Company's roof garden. After entering the Gong Wu Tai Theatre, he changed his name to his current name, giving the impression of ascending the dragon gate and increasing his value a hundredfold. Chunbai put a lot of effort into learning the Qi School, and his singing and acting are both just right. It is acceptable that he has a considerable foundation in martial arts, which is something that Baisui and Hefeng cannot match. Xinfang was a martial arts actor in his early years. Indirectly speaking, the plays that Xinfang performs cannot be pleasing without a considerable foundation in martial arts. Therefore, Xinfang once made an absolute judgment, believing that Wang Chunbai will definitely be one of the most successful people in learning the Qi School.</p>
<p>As for Baisui, his artistry far surpasses that of Chunbai. However, his study of the Qi School is not as skilled as Chunbai's. Baisui originally followed Liu Hongsheng and joined halfway, paying his respects to Zhou Xinfang. In fact, with such a good voice as Baisui's, it is a real waste to learn the Qi School. Baisui also has a foundation in martial arts, but his movements are not graceful. It is acceptable that he often walks diagonally, which is extremely unsightly. His singing and reciting are among the best in the Qi School, but his acting is stiff, not as lively as Chen Hefeng's. Chen Hefeng was overly lively in his early years, almost greasy. In recent years, Hefeng has been able to weed out the dross and retain the essence. He is not as greasy as before, but more commendable. It is acceptable that his body is beautiful, and his skills in water sleeves and jumping robes are extremely capable of achieving a beautiful style. His art has indeed improved a lot.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three people, Xinfang's direct disciples also include the late Wang Yingzhou and Yang Baotong (Yu Zongying, Wang Shaolou, and Wang Fuying are all difficult to include in Xinfang's school, but they are also martial arts actors, so I will not discuss them). Wang Yingzhou's voice is the most like Xinfang's, but his acting is excessive. However, his art is indeed better than Yang Baotong's. Yang Baotong's learning of the Qi School can be said to be completely unremarkable. However, he is studious and tireless. "Where there is a will, there is a way." He will definitely make progress in the future.</p>
<p>Chen Xiaomu, Li Feichun, Xu Hongpei, and others are also hanging the banner of the Qi School (I have never heard of Zheng Yuanlin and Zhu Junpei, who Si Jun mentioned, as Laosheng of the Qi School). The art of Chen and Li is not elegant. Xu Hongpei has recently received guidance from Fan Shujian and has the air of making rapid progress. The younger generation is to be feared.</p>
<p>Speaking of amateur actors, there have been as many people learning the Qi School in recent years as there are carps crossing the river. In the past, Guo Xiaoxiao was the best. After Guo retired, Xinfang's son-in-law Zhang Zhongyuan can be called the leader in this field. Sun Lanting is considered the best in learning Xinfang's "Chasing Han Xin." Wang Qijun's singing is the most beautiful, and Zhu Lianfu is the most qualified and experienced. Others, such as Wang Xuechen and Hua Zhenya, are also believers in the Qi School. Cheng Yuzhang, who Si Jun mentioned, is Zhou Xinfang's eldest disciple, but he is not an amateur actor, and Yuzhang is not a Laosheng. These are my opinions, what do you think, Si Jun?</p>
<h3>Hitler's Lover: A Jewish Movie Star</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that the German leader Hitler to this day. In fact, who knows, he already has a lover, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that his lover is precisely the Jew he hates the most! This is really inexplicable, is it that heroes are short-lived and have long-lasting feelings for their children?</p>
<p>Speaking of this Jewish woman, she was originally a red star on the screen, named Lan Na Lifen Shide Lane Refenster, who is now twenty-one years old. She became an orphan without parents when she was fourteen years old. Her uncle took her to a song and dance theatre in Shengkangsi City to learn to dance. Because she was born beautiful and clever and lively, she became very famous in less than three years, and became an angel of the public. Finally, she got the help of friends and entered the Finas Film Company in Austria, and then she became a movie star again.</p>
<p>After she joined the film company, the films she acted in were all musicals or song and dance films, and she acted very little. It was not until the summer of the year before last, when a top red female star in the film company died of lung disease, that her fate turned for the better, like the sky clearing up after the rain.</p>
<p>Last year, Lanna went to Germany to find a famous musician, who was a close friend of Hitler's. Lanna and Hitler became acquainted through this "matchmaker."</p>
<p>When Hitler saw this contemporary celebrity Lanna, his iron heart was greatly shaken, causing this leader to almost throw some of his anti-Jewish thoughts out of the window. As a result, two people who were incompatible with each other fell in love.</p>
<p>But at first, Hitler did not know that this red star was Jewish. When their love was in full swing, Lanna bravely said to Hitler, "I am a Jewish woman! Do you still love me?" Hitler not only did not get angry after hearing this, but embraced Lanna and kissed her, saying, "It doesn't matter, as long as I love you," and then gave her a sweet kiss……</p>
<p>After the German Army Chief of Staff Goering heard about this sensational matter, he immediately advised Hitler, but Hitler said to Goering, "Please do not interfere in my private life." Goering was so angry when he heard this that he left.</p>
<p>Yes, how mysterious this should be! Lanna knew very well the danger of her situation, but she carefully wrapped the soft threads of love around this contemporary hard man—Hitler.</p>
<h3>On the Subject Matter and Compilation of Scripts</h3>
<p>— Xiaolan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the mission of a playwright lies in finding good subject matter and writing a good script to supply to the actors. The generation of subject matter is based on the playwright's unique intellect, recognizing the many major issues in society that people inadvertently overlook. Using his intelligent mind, he arranges authentic and imaginary facts, and with his flexible pen, he writes scripts to express the importance of the subject matter. Or, a clever playwright intersperses his own criticism into the script as a way to resolve the topic. In this way, the playwright not only makes the audience aware of the seriousness of the problem but also gives the audience help in solving the problem. If the playwright does not have rich experience and deep understanding of society, then it is better to write the subject matter faithfully without adding any self-criticism, so that the audience can recognize this long-unnoticed problem and solve it themselves.</p>
<p>If the playwright has found good subject matter, before starting to compile it, he must grasp the core of the subject matter. If the core of this subject matter can be displayed without a trace in one act through the skills of compilation, then it can be known that this is the subject matter of a one-act play. Originally, the compilation of a script does not lie in the number of acts. In addition to the main act that showcases the core of the subject matter, the other acts in the compilation of multi-act plays must also grasp the core of each sub-act, so that the performance will not be scattered and bland. In addition to setting off and strengthening the importance of the main act, the emotions contained in each sub-act must be considered, so that the intensity of tension and enthusiasm does not exceed the performance of the main act, which would cause the defect of taking the host's place, and instead make the audience's ability to recognize it vaguely. The playwright should pay attention to this point when compiling.</p>

<h3>Silhouette of Chen Yunshang</h3>
<p>— (Deng Zhongwei)</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Zhihang is a master in the silhouette world. His superb skills have long been known for their reputation. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he went to Hong Kong. Almost all of the film industry and Cantonese opera stars there have Mr. Zheng's silhouettes. The above is one of his recent works.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City Liyuan in the Old Capital (120)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Actors' hobbies for eating, drinking, gambling, and playing with birds, animals, insects, and fish</p>
<p>After saying that, Shao Shan shouted at it again, "Three, yawn, bow, I'll give you smoke to smoke." The clever monkey immediately made these two movements. At that time, I found it very interesting. Shao Shan's buddy took the cage downstairs and put it on the bed for Shao Shan to burn for it to smoke. Unfortunately, monkeys are naturally fond of movement and not fond of quiet. Shao Shan's original intention was only to restrain its nature, and he would release it in at most three or four days. Unexpectedly, it suffocated to death in a few days. Shao Shan was very regretful about this matter, and even cried loudly. He put it in a wooden box and sent it to Pushan Villa. People who didn't know the situation suspected that it was a young master or a young lady from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>Once, Shao Shan went to Hong Kong with Dr. Mei to perform. He spent six hundred yuan to buy a small tiger. This tiger had a very clear "king" character on its head. Also, because he was born in the year of the tiger, he was willing to pay a great price to buy it, intending to bring it back to Shanghai, where he could open an animal exhibition hall of tigers, monkeys, cats, and dogs in his residence. Unexpectedly, this tiger was too small. When he was on the ship, he gave it a large piece of raw beef to eat. Because it did not have great chewing power, it could not swallow it down, nor could it spit it out. In this way, it was stuck to death alive. His extravagance and his love for raising livestock are indeed rare and very strange in the Liyuan industry.</p>
