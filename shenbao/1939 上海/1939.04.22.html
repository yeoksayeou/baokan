<p>社評</p>
<h3>展開反汪運動</h3>
<p>在全國精神總動員推行的今日，應該立刻展開一個反汪運動，反汪就是反漢奸，只有反汪才是全中國意志集中現階段最具體的表現。</p>
<p>要認識反汪運動的必要，就得先清除一切對汪兆銘賣國行動的恕辭。有些人以為汪兆銘的荒謬行為，無非起於一時的觀察錯誤，至於他的動機總還是可諒的。其實汪兆銘的叛國勾當，事前早有預定計劃，所以屢次發表怪誕言論，最後竟不恤與近衛合串雙簧，做日閥的內應；等到叛跡昭著以後，又沒有絲毫悔禍的表示，反而變本加厲，偽造文件，播弄是非，嗾使黨羽，進行反動組織，這種有計劃有步驟的行動，還可以算是一時的觀察錯誤嗎？另有些人珍惜汪兆銘過去的政治生命，認為目前他雖屬倒行逆施、但不妨處之以恕道。其實對一個人寬恕，無非希望他能夠悔悟；汪兆銘既然不會悔悟、寬恕他何用？況且一個人的善惡，全看最後的表現，汪兆銘的軀體雖尚未到蓋棺的時期，但是精社上的已經結果束了他的一生，他已經自我表現為一個賣國求榮的奸徒，即使過去有一二小善，也何能掩蓋其最後的奸惡？何況汪兆銘一生歷史全是投機、為了發揮他的領袖欲起見，慣作朝三暮四覆雨翻雲的勾當，根本連小善小信也找不到，我們可以珍惜他什麼呢？更有一些人以為汪兆銘除幾個爪牙以外，沒有群眾，他的言論只是個人的行動，根本不會發生什麼作用的，不妨聽他自己幻滅，何必這樣重視呢？其實汪兆銘誠然沒有群眾，誠然不足重視；可是他現在已經是日閥的工具，他的主子已從那可憐的荷包裏掏出了一部份錢替他張揚，替他拉攏群醜，有所重大企圖，同時他的爪牙又大肆活動，正打算從印刷物或教育界裏施展鬼蜮技倆，遂其　惑人心的陰謀，倘使不加防止，聽其滋長，這是抗戰過程中所不能容許的。</p>
<p>我們只有一讀吳稚暉氏斥責汪兆銘的文字，便知道他如何處心積慮地出賣國家民族，如何做了日閥的內應，自毀其治政生命，更如何不知悔禍，繼續進行他的陰謀。所以每一個中國人都應該知道汪兆銘是無可宥恕的奸徒，寬恕奸徒就是一種罪惡。</p>
<p>自從汪兆銘對他的「友邦」獻了一個滅亡中國的計劃以後，日本已於三月上旬起開始在江西等處舉行新進攻；可是中國政府除了再三申明堅決抗戰的立場以外，再在日方氣衰力竭的時候，舉行反攻，而且節節勝利，這不啻粉碎了日閥與汪兆銘的聯合陰謀。然而這還是不夠的，中國國民應該把普遍的反汪運動來配合政府的行動，使汪兆銘的陰謀，不但一時粉碎，而且永遠不再發生。</p>
<p>反汪運動的內容應該是蕭清一切的漢奸理論。第一，抗戰是國策，抗戰勝利是必然的結果，二十一個月來的事實已證明了中國根本未敗，日本卻已著著走上了潰敗的道路，因此根本上無所謂「兩敗俱傷，」在未達到勝利的目的以前根本上無和平可言，如果妄談和平，那就是漢奸。第二，中國的統一戰線是根據事實的需要而建立的，目前正在成長，正在充實，無絲毫破裂的徵象；即使將來抗戰結束以後，中國還要在統一戰線的陳營裏建設斬新的三民主義共和國，也沒有絲毫破裂的可能。那替中國前途作無謂杞憂的言論的，也就是漢奸。在反汪運動中，人人應該負有檢舉漢奸理論加以糾正的責任。</p>
<p>反汪運動應該是普遍的，有組織的；應該與精神總動員相配合，作為精神總動員實施要項之一。至於在上海，應該由教育界來領導這反汪運動，並且教育界自身先舉行澈底的思想上的肅反運動，因為反汪運動的性質是意識上的爭取真理，由教育界來領導最為適宜，而且又盛傳汪系爪牙正企圖向上海教育界施展陰謀，行使思想毒菌的注射。</p>
<p>反汪運動應該盡量地擴充到遊擊區裏去。因為在日偽控制的區域中，中國同胞受著知識的封鎖，不容易了解到目前中國的局勢；同時日偽又積極地施行麻醉和奴化的精神訓練，在偽報紙上把汪兆銘捧作救世的真主，蒙蔽中國同胞。因此反汪運動應該滲入淪陷地域，用一切可能的方法揭穿日偽捧汪的用意，宣揚抗戰的真諦，解除苦難同胞們精神上的錮蔽。</p>
<h3>日本報紙失望　美對日本　又提出抗議　要求恢復長江通航　及佔領區美僑自由</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國艦隊已集中於太平洋、據國務卿赫爾昨日宣稱、美國為企圖使在華日軍佔據區域內之美僑，可以獲得較多之自由起見，或將再行向日本提出緊急抗議、同時國務副卿韋爾斯曾接見日大使堀內謙介、質問關於日方允諾開放揚子江事件、赫爾亦謂、揚子江問題、乃為美國行將提起抗議中主要點之一、此一抗議、將由美駐日大使格魯向日外務省提出、（二十一日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>美對中日兩國　應分別待遇　討論中立法修正問題　美學者教士發表意見</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國外交政策協會主席布爾、昨在參院外交委員會中聲稱、渠對畢德曼之「現款交易」條款雖極贊同、但對遠東方面、則應除外、以防日本受惠、據布氏言、日本擁有海軍及大批商船、獲取美國之軍火材料與其他需要品、殊為易易、故國會假若取畢氏之辦法、則應另立條文、不使日本得享此項利益、蓋為維持中國門開放政策·對華之人道利益·九國公約·及菲列賓之地位計、美國確應將中國問題分別而論、布氏對於德國、認為德國假若擊敗英法、則美國即將為其俎上肉、故英法與中國假若一日抵抗反其集團、則美國即可苟安一日、又據最近自華返此之教士吉德博士在眾院外交委員會中言、美國在日本此次對華戰爭中、實居於幫凶之地位、美國假若拒絕與日本貿易、則不出三月、日本即將無從進行戰爭、且美國不許日本獲取美國資源、辭正義嚴、理由極為充足、一則日本已破壞九國公約、二則日本此次侵略中國、純為有意破壞文化之殘酷行動、三則倘日本征服中國、則日本即將進而攫取荷屬東印度與菲列賓、蓋東京方面之南進主張、甚為有力也、（二十一日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>紀武寧爭奪戰</h3>
<p>（長沙）　昨歲九月、武漢會戰方酣、日軍為掩護其由瑞武公路轉經　鄂幹線北犯陽新部隊之側翼、曾遺萱島·牟田·兩聯隊、進襲武寧東北之覆血山、以牽制武寧華軍之出而截擊、當時日軍前鋒、一度攻至覆血山西南之羅盤·棺材·諸山·並佔據各高峯、武寧岌岌可危、後經華軍　　　·　　　·兩部隊、奮勇與日軍血戰於羅盤·棺材·兩山之深穀、日軍凶熖始挫、武寧亦</p>
<p>轉危為安、自此以後、華日各據羅盤·棺材·兩山之半、今歲三月、日軍謀攻略南昌、由鄂南調兵、循贛鄂幹線南下、參加戰鬥、俾中途不致遭遇意外、以約一師團半兵力、逞其凶熖、自二十日起、指向華武寧東北、於是英勇壯烈之武寧爭奪戰序幕、</p>
<p>遂告展開　日於武漢南昌兩役、均不得不對武寧方面加以嚴重顧慮、於會戰時期、必須以重兵在該方面助攻、其理由、（一）武寧位於贛鄂線之中間、而贛鄂幹線又為現階段作戰中、日軍賴以來回使用侵入湘鄂贛邊境兵力之重心、蓋經由南潯線循長江至</p>
<p>粵漢北段　終不若經由贛鄂幹線之直捷、日循該條幹線向西北週轉、又須通過武寧北部之大橋、向東南週轉、更須通過武寧東南之著溪、華方據有武寧、無異向敵之軸心中、打入一楔子、並如砥柱之隨時可使日之軸心中斷、而週轉不靈、乃至</p>
<p>陷於潰滅　故在武漢南昌兩役、日軍均非以重兵攻擊武寧不可、我方亦不惜以相等兵力固守之、此次日軍之擊武寧、雖開始於上月廿日之拂曉、在前夕、箸溪巾口一帶之人聲嘈雜、與馬鳴蕭蕭、華前線將士已斷定此為日將攻擊之徵兆、嚴陣以待、先是、我據羅盤·棺材·兩山南部各軍、利用與日軍南北對峙時期、在陣地前方、築有</p>
<p>堅固塹壕　並完成爾後、羅盤·棺材·為東西向之山地、贛鄂幹線與箸溪武寧公路交叉之三角地、南有修河之阻、西障波田河（一名蘆水）、與水舟尖加白　望人舟諸山相望、距武寧約十五公裏、華方預知在羅盤·棺材·南部難作久守、故先於箸武公路以北之波田西岸有利要地、選作與日軍</p>
<p>血戰之場　二十日拂曉、日於攻擊開始前、先排列各種大小炮數十尊於羅盤·棺材·之北部、向華陣地集中發射達四百餘發、晨九時、日機三十餘架、不斷向華陣地輪迥投擲輕磅炸彈、及後約兩聯隊之日軍、利用炮火掩護、專向羅盤·棺材·南部衝鋒、另有日軍二百餘、偷渡波田、擾亂華後方、是時嘯空密來之巨彈爆發、與</p>
<p>山崩地裂　之濃煙塵霧、雖彌漫天地、而華英勇將士仍能沉著以機槍手溜彈、對日不稍後退、竟日混戰、華陣地屹然未動、華陣地前方、日軍屍首滿穀、並有日兩聯隊長在內、偷渡波田之少數日軍、亦悉被殲滅、（未完待續）</p>

<h3>美當局分析　羅斯福計劃　對墨索里尼演說失望但認爲尙留作餘地</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院某員今日聲稱、義相墨索里尼之拒絕羅斯福總統和平提議、固屬使人失望、然尚留合作之餘地、如美總統願進行其担保和平與召開大會解決國際紛爭之建議、則當可於墨索里尼言論中表示和平意思之處、覓見繼續進行之根據、墨索里尼雖輕視召開大會之價値、然未完全拒絕此種主張、據美總統之計盡、最大的會議、應討論經濟問題、軍縮會議應以軍備强盛之國家爲限、而政治會議則僅限於直接有關之歐洲國家、羅斯福總統在其呼籲和平之電文中、業已言及召開三種大會、分別考慮軍縮經濟與政治問題矣、國務院入員預料、希特勒對於美總統答復、大旨當與義相所言者相同、不過較長、且將言及其所可接到巴爾幹諸國之覆文、因希特勒現已向巴爾幹諸國詢問其是否感覺德國之威脅也云、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>墨索里尼言論　德方完全贊同　謂對羅斯福間接答復美報謂實力在希特勒</h3>
<p>（柏林）義相墨索里尼昨在羅馬所發表之言論、此間官塲認爲滿意、並予以完全同意、指此爲對羅斯福總統而發之間接答復、且爲對民治國而發的軸心國團結之又一有力表示、某政論家謂、希特勒亦曾言及德國之建設活動、乃德國和平意志之明證云、（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）義國首相墨索里尼本日所發表之演說、頃由此間各觀察家加以評論云、此乃德義軸心對於羅斯福總統之初步答案、一俟本月二十八日衆議院開會時、希特勒元首即當提出詳細答案、其內容聞將譴責各民治國惟知自利、凡爾賽和的種種不公道、並謂德國因欲樹立正義、奠定和平、曾經提出各種建議、卒爲各民治國所拒絕、以致不克實現云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）義大利首相墨索里尼昨所發表之演說、頃由紐的泰晤士報加以評論、略謂德義軸心之實權、操諸希特勒元首之手、於此灼然可見矣、墨索里尼首相會以「地理的謬誤」爲言、此殆德義兩國提出要求之新論據、此種要求、實巳耳熟能詳、即德義兩國資源有限、未便株守現狀、務求擴展勢力、以不利於他國是也、關於此層、希特勒元首於本月二十八日發表演說時、當可作較詳之說明、此次墨索里尼首相之客吐其詞、而將正式答復羅斯福總統之責諉諸合夥人、則德義軸心之盟主係屬何人、不問可知云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）義國首相墨索里尼本日發表演說之後、赫爾國務卿僅在報端見其大要、拒不加以評論、國務院方面亦云、義相此項演詞、未知是否羅斯福總統本月十四日電之唯一答覆、此在各報、則衆口一詞、加以譴責、咸謂義相所言、實即對於羅斯福總統之呼籲、率直加以拒絕、但外交界人士則謂、德義兩國提出覆文時、原不能望其有切實的「是或否、」蓋在獨裁者口中即使表示妥協、亦必出以聲勢洶洶之口吻、始可取悅於本國輿論、此外、一般人均謂義相墨索里尼既不允提供保證在某一時期內不以侵略爲事、他日發生爭端時、義國若果參加、則何人爲侵略者即不難予以指定、今茲唯一希望、厥爲義相經由外交途徑、再以正式覆文、送達羅斯福總統、至渠本日所發表之演說、或可認爲一種策略、欲在美國與世界各國引起反應、藉以覘知輿論向背、以便正式草擬覆文云（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）義國首相墨索里尼昨所發表之演說、頃由此間各報加以評論、咸謂此乃一種「臨時的答案」、其語氣雖尚溫和、但不足以引起樂觀、加之、西班牙國民軍總司令弗朗哥將軍、奏凱式進入瑪德里城日期、業已再度延展、（原定於五月二日、嗣經改爲十五日、茲又改爲三十日）、德國艦隊又將開至西班牙國海面、凡此均應加以極大注意、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英法俄軍事同盟　蘇俄提出對案　英國方面稍爲難　但不致影響談判</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日電報外交記者稱、蘇聯方面所提出建設性質之辦法、似可無疑問的證明、蘇聯不附保留或限制、加入英法所提出以其所有力量與資源在歐洲抵抗獨裁國侵略之願意、惟蘇聯所提議者、或將引起若干技術上難題、聞英駐蘇大使西資曾向蘇聯外長李維諾夫提議、蘇聯對波蘭與羅馬尼亞兩國、担保以任何最便利方法予以援助、上星期莫斯科對此建議、尚猶豫不決、而懷疑於英國對羅波兩國担保之實際價値、今則異是、英內閣現須考慮、蘇聯提議如何將在各小國之已知態度上與其政治輿地形勢上、發生影響、大的須研究數日後、英國方能以其研究所得者、回答莫斯科也、柏林傳稱、英國如加强其對蘇關係、則一星期後希特勒發表和平言論的機會、將歸消滅、此項諷示決不能使英政府停頓其對蘇交換外交意見云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府因欲組成反侵略集團、正與蘇聯進行談判、擬由該國接受片面的的束、以保障各鄰邦、勿任遭受侵略、頃悉蘇聯政府業已提出對案、正由英國內閣加以硏究、其內容聞共四點、（一）東歐西歐倘欲組成反侵略集團、則參加各國、必須成立自動實施性之協定、互相團結、關於此層、英國現行外交政策、則欲避免自動的的束、藉以安慰羅馬尼亞波蘭兩國、（二）英法蘇三國當簽訂無保留的互助公的、而由各該國參謀部成立協定、加以補充、此乃　體安全制之惟一可能的基礎、（三）英法兩國向羅馬尼亞波蘭兩國所提供之安全保障、對於任何國所可加諸各該國之侵略一律適用、未免有將蘇聯列入侵略國之嫌、宜加以修正、而作爲針對德國之保障、（四）羅波兩國、宜先成立軍事協定、專爲防止德國侵略、然後蘇聯乃能向各該國提供保障、凡此各節、英國負責方面所獲初步印象·並不十分惡劣、認爲蘇聯確有參加集體安全組織之誠意、但依照對案須當明白指定德國爲侵略國、則和平集團殆已變爲包團陣綫、匪特德國可引爲口實、即羅波兩國亦未必願意接受、他如義大利、葡萄牙、西班牙三國、尤無復贊成英國政策之可能、以故英國各閣員中、即使顧與蘇聯締結同盟條的者、亦復有難色、惟是土耳其國亟盼英蘇兩國成立協定、而蘇聯之參加又爲組成反侵略集團所不可少、英國政府或當覓致折衷方案、俾蘇聯應允合作、其他各國亦能加以接受云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）關於反侵略集團組織問題、蘇聯態度如何、外國方面曾經發出各種消息、但蘇聯所採立塲並不若是鮮明、人民外交委員長字維諾夫、連日與英國大使西慈爵士進行談話、駐英大使遇斯基日昨已自倫敦返國、携有各種情報、以供李維諾夫參考、蘇聯態度或可因而有所確定云、（二十日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間外交界人士頃宣稱、關於組織集體安全制事、英國與蘇聯兩國所進行之建設性質的談話、經過至爲良好、英法蘇三國與其他各關係國、均有成立妥協之望云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據此間可靠方面消息、英法兩國、不問波蘭羅馬尼亞願否於被侵略時接受蘇聯之軍事援助、決計與蘇聯訂立三國軍事協定、該項軍事協定、目前雖尚在繼續談判中、但大致已告完畢、其所以猶在談判中之原因、無非欲探悉波羅二國之反對緣由、並將二國拉入三國軍事協定之中、假設波羅堅不加入、則英法蘇三國軍事協定、卽將成立、同時一旦有事時、三國軍事如何合作之辦法、將於最近期間再開軍事談話會商定、至外傳英法將担保蘇聯遠東方面疆界之謠傳、此間認爲無稽、並謂此一問題應由美國出而發言、」（二十一日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府仍希翼與義大利和解、昨夜對義相墨索里尼在古羅馬帝國京城坎波多格里奧地方之演說、已開始作詳細硏究、此間官方對墨氏演說之第一反嚮、即爲此次演說、雖對羅斯福總統之和平建議及英國之包圍政策、表示反對、然內容並無足以增加歐洲情勢之嚴重性處、義相墨索里尼宣告羅馬柏林軸心政策爲和平政策者、完全與義大利在阿比西尼亞西班牙及阿爾巴尼亞之活動、互相矛盾矣、（二十一日美聯社電）</p>

<p>假名索詐工作、然彭朱雙方均各自為政、並不合作、而陳學明雖屬於朱祁之一派、但一面仍與彭派暗送秋波、互通消息、最近朱陳祁三人偵悉河南路金隆街二十號楊鼎源棉花廠主楊雪樵、於國軍西移之後、曾出任某方所組織之滬西七寶鎮「維持會會長」之職、</p>
<p>魚肉鄉民更以其出品之棉花與某方交易、乃依此題目、於月之九日上午十一時、三人同往楊處、向楊雪樵要挾、謂若不以巨款為壽、將以爾之過去罪跡公諸報章、同時並以厲詞相恫嚇、楊懼而即以一百五十元給與祁等三人、始相偕而去、但此消息經陳學明傳達與彭紅天輩、彭以楊既</p>

<h3>外交的歧途</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>政治的內容，固然很複雜，而外交的進行，尤其多歧途。歧途旣多，莫知適從，當然要有「亡羊」的結果，而擇途不愼，誤入邪途，也一樣達不到正當目的。</p>
<p>侵略我們的鄰邦，從前曾用「水鳥外交」來對付我們，意思便是說，表面上如水鳥一般，身體浮在水面上，頗有和平氣象，而兩爪則仲在水下，盡其鈎索的能事，因此他們一面和我們開談判，講親睦，一面則蠶食鯨呑，由東北四省而華北，逼得我們不得小在蘆溝橋開始放出抗戰的砲聲。這是他們誤入邪途的結果。</p>
<p>發起反侵略同盟的英國，似乎已經從「莫知適從」的進行上，確定其正途了，然而我們現在父聽見了張伯倫似在採取「糖菓與皮鞭政策」的外交。他所領導的政府，一面在組織集體安全，一面又不惜對德國表示好感，願與德國作經濟談判，甚焉者還有人說英國在暗地裏勸說波蘭，將但澤和平地交還德國·這常然危險；如果按照這種政策推行下去，英國的外交誤入邪途，發生惡果，又將成爲必然的事實了。</p>
<p>侵略我們的鄰邦，據說，現在關於外交，又在「彷徨歧途」了。牠的軍閥要加入反共軍事同盟，而外交界則「認爲與民治國接近，較爲得計，否則恐將走入自殺之途。」他們將來究竟要走正途或邪途，現在還不曉得，不過我想，假使他們不要自殺，總應該不走邪途而與民治國接近吧。</p>
<p>外交上的歧途太多了，而歧途中的邪途，也可以說是絕途，尤其多至不可勝數，只有賢明的政府當局，才能抉別得淸楚而在正途上推行得徹底·除了我們早就有一定的主張，徹底抗戰，完成建國大業，走上坦蕩的大途以外，美國現在也總算淸楚地表示出她的態度了，什麼中立法，孤立派，都因羅斯福的宣言，而成爲無足輕重的細事了。我們和美國，在今日的外交上，也足以自豪了。</p>
<p>所以，外交的歧途是多的，但這裏面到底這有一條正途在。我望每一個政府當局，都能找到這一條正途，而追回「亡羊」，就是奠定世界的和平，共存共榮。</p>
<h3>笨（上）</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>他四十多歲，呌王本中。但是在我們隊裏，大家都呌他王笨蟲，有時簡單些，就只呌笨蟲，不提他的姓。</p>
<p>這不是隨便呌呌的；他的確笨，叉因爲本中和策蟲的音相近，所以就呌定了。</p>
<p>隊長初見他，問他的話，他除了自己的姓名以外，便說不大淸楚。後來問了鎭上人，才知道他不是本地人，從小跟父母到此，父母死後，就一直流落在此。叉據鎭上人說，他除了吃飯睡覺以外，一無所知；除了有氣力可以替人家挑水挑東西以外，一無所能。孤零零的一身，就此由幼而長，由</p>
<p>不過隊長問他爲什麼要加入隊伍時，他却也說得出，爲了××着實可惡，他要殺××人，隊長說，他知道這一點，不算笨；又看他本身毫無牽墨，人旣老實，又有氣力，也許有些用塲，隊長便答應他加入了我們的隊伍。</p>
<p>然而他舉竟是笨的。他不會操。無論如何敎他，跨起步來，不是左手和左足同前，便是右手和右足同後；再不然，就只有兩隻手夾緊了身體，一動不動。隊長呌我們注意前面的目標，不可旁觀時，他果然就一眼不　，老望着前面，甚至隊長發了別的口令，他都聽不進去，以致獨自落在隊伍的後面，或者衝出隊伍的前面。</p>
<p>一枝槍在他的肩頭上，斜斜地宛如掮扁担的形式，老改不過來。敎他放槍，那就更其不會了！退膛，裝子彈，瞄準，拔機，這一切事情，敎了這樣，忘了那樣，總是弄不像。有一天，隊長急了，對他說：　『你不會放槍，怎麼能够打仗呢？』他却笑笑說：『那不要緊，可以用刀戳的。』</p>
<p>因此大家還是笑他，說他到底還是笨的：不會放槍，只會用刀戳。</p>
<p>的確，我們除了每人有一枝槍外，還有一把大刀。他，笨蟲，不，王本中，不要說不會放槍，連擦槍也不會，因爲他拆不開機器，也裝不攏牠們；他只會磨刀，每天他總將刀磨得刷亮，鋒利無比。</p>
<p>幾個月來，他在我們裏面的笨事幹得很多。例如我們說，誰吃飯最多，誰就是好漢，他一定就比誰都吃得多，寗願捧了肚子倚在墻壁上噎氣。只要我們稱讚他氣力大，搬東西時，儘可向他的肩頭上裝，壓得他腿都立不直，　玎而行，他决不推辭一句。我們賽跑，他當然跑不過我們，可是他總是上氣不接地跑到頭。……</p>
<p>這一晚，隊長安排了進攻』華鎭的計劃，華鎭本來是沒有×軍的，今天却從城裹開來了五六十個人，說是來搜索游擊隊的，因爲來不及回城，就此在市梢吳家祠堂裏住下了。隊長正在祠堂的前後面，都分派了人，只等他的號槍一放，呌大家前後夾攻進去；又在由祠堂通到鎮外去的要道上，分頭埋伏了好幾擋人，以便截擊·</p>
<p>王本中是跟着隊長在前面的，他覺得很高興，今晚居然可以殺××人，只是將手裏的刀在空中揮舞着。槍呢，因爲學不會放，早就不措了·</p>
<p>黑沈沈的半夜裹，隊長拍的放一響，吳家祠堂的前後，就像爆芝蔴一般，槍聲連續地響了起來。可是奇怪，裏面却一些沒有聲息，而意料中的回擊的槍聲，却在他們的背後響了起來。</p>
<h3>春天的新裝</h3>
<h3>從新啓蒙運動到精神動員</h3>
<p>— 同芳</p>
<p>新啟蒙運動是目前最迫切需要推進的一種文化和思想運動。中國的抗戰進展到現階段，無疑的我們需要更强固的民族意識，以完成建國的任務。文化和思想雖屬觀念形態，但牠却是社會發展不可缺少的動力，我們今日能够築成這樣强固堅韌的民族統一戰綫，展開這樣偉大的抗戰局面，完全由於全國有着一致的抗戰禦侮的共同信念和思想。任何思想雖是出自實踐的，可是爲求實踐獲得實效，就應把各種思想加以精密的硏討與批判，使與實踐吻合；在全國人民的思想自然的鎔滙以後，才可以充分地表現出劃一的意見，人力物力也才有完全發揮的可能。所以，在目前的中國基於實踐的發展的要求，從思想與文化上廣泛地推廣新啟蒙述動，統一各方的見解，以建立鞏固的思想陣綫，來擊破抗戰期中的各種不健全的思想，掃蕩各種傳統的歪曲理論，實在是再近切沒有的。</p>
<p>從這點上，我們就得重視蔣委員長昭示給我們的國民精神動員了。在目前抗戰進展到第二個階段，敵人正處於進退維谷的時候，精神動員綱領的提出，不僅可以强調我們的精神意識，貫微抗戰禦侮的決心，以奠定全國一致的思想的基礎，並且還指示出現階段中國思想的共同目標，作爲未來建設新中國的電要準備，我覺得這正和新啟蒙運動同爲促成國民精神武裝所必需的一種運動。</p>
<p>精神動員綱領規定了今日中國國民應盡的任務，又要我們把民族國家視爲前提，集中思想與意志，爲爭取生存而奮鬥；更提出抗戰最後的目的在建立獨立自由平等，民有民治民享的三民主義共和國。革除自私自利的封建思想，建立抗戰期中所必需的新人生觀，可說趁精神動員的骨幹。僅就改造國民精神，革除傳統惡習和積極的充實及集中國民意志幾點來說，已可知精神動員不僅提供了中國今後思想運動所應走的途徑，同時還是民族團結對外的更高階段的發展。由各黨各派各階層的聯合，進而爲思想的統一和精動的集中，因此凡是動搖抗戰，破壞國家統一與民族利益的漢奸思想，都應完全廓淸，使民主政治的理想得以實現。</p>
<p>但是我們爲要逹到精神動員的各項共同目標，仍須努力推進大衆的知識運動，亦即是說，我們不能忽略展開思想上的新啟蒙運動，以完成抗戰建國的最後的任務。</p>
<p>在二期抗戰的過程中，固應注重軍事的發展，而動員移個民族的思想，也是不可忽視的；因此我們迫切地需要描蕩一切不利抗戰的傳統思想，並推進建設新中國的精神基礎。如果我們承認新啟蒙運動對於抗戰建國的重要，那麼我們就應接受精神動員的綱領，以形成廣大的思想陣綫，做實踐的主要依據！</p>
<h3>向榮草</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>在淺水池塘邊，荒城郊野外，垂楊古道旁，僻靜深山中，甚或半弓小圃內，經過幾番夜雨，偶然晴霽時，透露了欣欣的歡笑，告訴我們：春意愈深，生命愈滋長也愈蓬勃了。</p>
<p>「天涯何處無芳草？」卽使黃天萬里的沙漠中，亦不免於傍水處，佈開一片萋萋，綠色的歡愉，給旅人解除心的飢渴。</p>
<p>撒下一把生命的種子，在字宙間，這往往象徵着生命的活力，脚步踐踏了，她會再長高些身材；霜雪摧零了，她會再接受更多的溫暖；野火燒焦了，春風起時她將再生。從奮鬭中來，也將奮鬭中去。千萬年來，永遠有牠一份生命，佔領着宇宙的一席。不曾吞噬於寒冬，屈伏於死亡，摧殘於暴力力；壓下的，頂高了；逼緊的，排開了；擠近的，推遠了；攫奪的，討回了；打擊的，還手了；蟄伏的，開展了。——在淺水池塘邊，……</p>
<p>跟着深深的春意，野草一天天發育，長高。在溫暖陽光中，花開又花落，陽光愈暖，春意愈深，生機也愈蓬勃。不似巫山巫峽的蕭森，也不似風急天高時的玉露，過往的凄凉，消失於塵士。晴翠與遠芳，乃換來一幅熱情的筆調。</p>
<p>忘記了昨天的厄運，我們又看見野草爬上泥土。帶着戰士的姿態，她向我們笑，祝我們各有一個春天。</p>
<p>我們感激，也驚訝。</p>
<p>「你從那兒來？」</p>
<p>「我從奮鬭中來。」</p>
<p>「你再往那兒去？」</p>
<p>「往奮鬭中去。」</p>
<p>她坐下了，坐在「大地」的磐石上。</p>
<p>她告訴我們許多故事。跌入在過去的回憶裏，一會兒她笑，一會兒她又肅然流淚。說了一整天，一整夜，流利，生動，天眞，溫柔，深刻。</p>
<p>春風駘蕩中，野草的臉閃爍有光。過去的艱苦，今日都已變成趣味的回憶。想起昔日的淚，乃萌芽今日之歡笑。</p>
<p>春猶淺，天猶微寒，草猶未十分茂盛。雖已欣欣向榮了，但須尤繁，尤高，尤密，尤加開展。</p>
<p>「祝你也有一個好好的春天。」我們報以微笑。</p>
<h3>自我良心測驗</h3>
<p>— 吟川</p>
<p>精神總動員的發動，使孤島上每一個人都有一番猛烈的反省了！各本良心，根據綱領，先作以下的自我測驗一下吧！（一）我現在的生活是正當的有意義的還是醉生夢死的？沉醉在賭窟，舞塲？（二）我在糊糊塗塗中過生活嗎？「抗戰到底」「抗戰必勝，建國必成」的信仰，奮發蓬勃樂觀的朝氣我有嗎？（三）我是不是想永遠像這樣平安的生活，永遠在孤島上住下去？還是一有機會，或者國家需要我們的時候馬上獻出一切？（四）我有沒有忘記了國家民族的利益？喪權辱國消損國力的勾當我幹過嗎？（五）我有沒有想過，我是一個中華民族的國民？中華民族的國民是篤信正理眞義，爲殺滅摧隳人類文明福祉的蟊賊而戰，爲民族的復興而奮鬥。絕對服從最高領袖的指揮，擁護民族統一戰綫：那些托派漢奸汪逆游塊的荒謬理論有沒有搖撼過我？</p>
<p>國民精神總動員在五月一日就要開始了，我們在自我良心測驗過後，就要本着良心宣誓，在誓的上簽字。從此天天時時刻刻在心底腦海鐫着這幾句話：國家至上，民族至上；軍事第一，勝利第一；意志集中，力量集中。同時自問：我有沒有違背國民公的？我遵着誓的實行嗎？</p>

<h3>外滙供求　依舊平衡</h3>
<p>滙市昨以墨索里尼演說、內容未露戰意、故歐洲人心稍定、致英美間滙率開盤平定、收盤猛長一八七五、至本市暗槃、爲狀仍頗穩定、中途雖洋行扒結現貨英美兩金外、及五月份美滙兼日銀行託英行有利跟踪扒結現貨英金、無如英美銀行界仍肯供塞、因之結果仍平、交易尚旺、至港滙因雙方買賣勢均、故仍鮮變化、結果亦平、</p>

<h3>證券　債市升沉靡定</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、仍以消息反復不已、市價隨之亦震盪不已、經一度高漲後、旋即下游、升沉靡定、波動亦頻、可見人心尚恍惚、在此環境出入頗鉅之際、易爲環境消息所支配、隨市浮沉者、倐而抬倐而壓、無非做作、以遂其搶帽子之砍望、實亦利用消息兩歧之時機耳、環境若無變化、市價當暫盤旋矣、昨日趨勢、上午情形、幾與前兩日完全相同、初則猛漲、繼則猛跌、收盤時又微緊、各號進出頻繁、天生號先進後出、大通聯和　德恒孚及水康均有需要、四十二號亦有相當吸收、惟叫號十一十四及二十號等賣氣甚湧、大豐同康等亦有出脫、市况乃漸漸轉疲、比之隔日反小三五角、午後形勢比較堅穩、但交易巳淸、收市甚早、買賣雙方均不踴躍、市價結果、略小三角至四角半、成交總數共計約八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　潮汕帮止辦後　現紗一度傾跌　終以多頭又起維持各紗售價反跌爲漲</h3>
<p>紗市仍屬不脫盤旋之境、但實需交易、益覺滯遲無勁、市塲上傳言潮汕帮有止裝止辦說、謂該處情形略緊、於是該帮在前市只包未曾動辦、致一部份人心怠懈、但筆者得此消息後、作一度詳細調查、據某棉業機關消息、謂該處運進之貨、被官廳嚴厲檢查以後、發現有劣貨魚目混珠之棉織品殊夥、因此官方囑商號登記核准貨名、然後才許進口、所以來電暫行買貨須待手續辦妥、再當裝貨、上午市象微受影響而平疲、午後又轉熱鬧、多說日紗在騰、華紗售價較廉、買戶復起而挺進矣、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、有一部得到閩帮不辦貨消息、市氣鬆落、開價忽跌二元、二十支雙馬價爲四百元、棧單價爲三百九十五元半、市上實銷平淡無奇、旋以日紗價昻、有某布廠進二十支金虎三百五十包、人心振盪、市况轉昂、徐徐回升、二十支雙馬價爲四百零一元半至二元、與上日價相平、後市開槃中身二十支紗因塌戶活動、市情上升二三元、二十支五福牧羊漲力爲强、二十支雙馬價爲四百零二元半、汕頭帮始終未有交易、查全日各帮買去統計一千九百九十包、行情二十支雙馬漲五角、牧羊五福漲二·三元、十支粗紗交易轉少、價平、三二支·四二支亦無上下、廠方由崇信廠開出廿支大發二百包、價爲三百九十包、五月至八月利泰廠、開出十五支醒獅五十包、價爲三百四十七元、今日有棉紗五百五十件運天津、五十五件運烟台、茲將各帮口買去之額錄左、</p>
<h3>英日紗何爲而漲　英紗的漲是自然趨勢日紗的漲是奸商把戲</h3>
<p>英紗二十支五福牧羊昨日銷路驟形活躍、同時售價亦趨上升、實因其價格較廉、乃引起一般囤戶注意焉、查其過去與二十支雙馬紗價之差額、比較略述如下、</p>
<p>（一）今年紅盤開價、二十支雙馬現紗價爲四百〇三元、牧羊價爲三百八十二元、目前雙馬現紗價復漲至四百〇二元、比較僅小一元、牧羊現紗價爲三百六十二元、比較耍跌二十元光景、</p>
<p>（二）照此情形、雙方比較差額程度相去太遠、今日他紗飛漲、就事實上着想、英紗較廉、於是引起買方在市搜羅、午後乃激動上漲三元以外、二十支牧羊價爲三百六十五元半、五福價爲三百五十七元至八元、</p>
<p>日紗市塲、近來耳聞步步昂騰、且昨日漲風愈形銳利、又現緊張局面、謂有軋空風潮、查其內幕情形、異常複雜、泰半理由、謂長江一路需要比較起色、然江浙兩省游擊區中、近來游擊戰尤劇、日紗布之銷路停滯、於是一般爲實際情况如斯、對於下月份拋空意思濃厚、豈料拋額一增、乃引起對方介意、由此一來、多方聯絡某方、將日紗額子關閉不開、市上在呌現貨缺乏、至於本月份、時期日近、拋空之額無處招等抵補、形勢一緊、乃軋空風聲洶洶、如果說其軋空、與事實覺得父不相符、因爲本月份二十支藍鳳紗價做三百六十六元、下月份卽五月到做三百七十二元、較上月價漲起五六元、</p>
<p>就其陣綫測之、仍是係本月小而下月大、查市塲過去情形觀之、決不象軋空頭、蓋軋空應當本月份漲得特別高、抬過下月份價、方才合乎事理、此中緣由、深恐局外人不知究竟、演的一齣什麼把戲、總之對於此項交易、謹愼爲上策也（A）</p>
<h3>美貸棉已允贖　印棉源源到滬</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初因利物浦電告下落、及國內外了結而跌、大衆同業俱抱觀望態度、華盛頓方面出口津貼之說、捉摸不定、此說尚有極大勢力之潛伏、美政府棉花貸款管理處、昨日公佈允許作一九三七年棉花貸款者、得按照前借款數額、加拆息棧租、備款可向政府取該年度之貸款棉、按照此種法則、各種等級之美棉、均可隨意購得矣、（一九三七年度之貸款棉共五、一九二、〇二〇包、總重二、六六九、八五〇、四〇〇磅）、昨日紐約跌叫磅音、印棉連同預測漲二羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、折合法幣計美棉及巴西棉每擔跌三角、印棉漲六角、埃及漲五角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、前因印棉定貨過多而水脚奇少、經各方極力設法、輪公司已包定輪船叫五艘、往來運輸印棉、故日來到貨尚多、因之各廠對於購辦原棉、又轉鬆懈、但衆料設能紗價高漲、或外棉猛跌、則各廠　將大量訂購矣、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價錄下、</p>
<p>印棉　續進口、明日到滬之意輪Arabia號、自印度喀拉基、運來棉花三千六百二十五件、起卸於浦東其昌棧云、</p>
<p>本棉生意、較爲起色、華廠對於顏色玉潔之華棉、納胃轉健、完全採取其漂亮關係、可予印棉相攙和合、然印棉爲主體、本棉僅拼配之用、數量歿鮮、故成交包脚不旺、然售價依然堅昂如恒、查其實際情形、絕無精彩可言、前途狀况、殊乏把握也、大概仍在進退維谷之問、蘇北來源中斷、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日美絲價猛跌　滬廠經外銷頓呆　輯里絲印非需要轉旺</h3>
<p>國外絲市、昨雖漲跌互見、但主要市塲、如美之紐約、及日之橫濱、一致猛跌、紐約近期猛跌一角〇五厘、計每擔跌去、法幣八十元許、遠期跌八分、日絲各跌四分、上海絲市一分、橫濱現貨跌三十元、遠期跌十元、僅里昂一埠、各絲獨見上升、良以里昂絲市、向唯日美絲價馬首是瞻、漲跌均不若前者靈活、昨里昂獨見上挺、或謂前受日美漲風影響所致耳、該埠絲價計日絲漲三法郞、上海絲A字漲五法郞、B字漲三·五〇法郞、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、昨白廠絲銷呆滯、洋行進價、較前日跌去五〇—七〇元、各廠商以前日售得善價、咸引爲幸運、但鑒於國內存底枯薄、中日生絲市價仍能保證相當高昂水準之條件、並未有基本變化、故人心依舊樂觀、是以洋行白廠絲銷、乃告停頓、又印非絲銷久告岑寂、邇來中外絲市步步上升、亦深受刺激、致昨日三星美大等白頭洋行、紛出輯里經交易、下干輯里雙烏等級、售開八百三十元、計漲三十元許、共成交四十担、又灰經昨亦有來賬、藥水絲價八百五元、計成交三十担、市盤均較前堅挺、</p>
<h3>新荼登場　茶商紛赴產區採辦</h3>
<p>本年新茶已屆登塲、各省紅綠箱茶、經貿委會繼續加强統制機構、在各產區設立收買機關、施以全部收買、並規定運輸新路綫、以便轉運香港集中、仍由當華公司與蘇俄訂立茶銷新契約、繼續去年茶銷優先權、故預料今年華茶貿易、當可益臻良好、至毛茶及店莊茶之內銷者、則須經貿委會核准、及結匯手續後、方可轉口、因此本埠經營洋莊茶業公會之會員茶棧、除一部分已前赴各產區就地設廠採製、及在港設營業辦事處、辦理接洽推銷事宜、另一部則已改設土莊製茶廠、均於近日紛派水客前往寗波·溫州·及游擊區之湖州一帶、準備採辦新茶、並有新創牌號多家、在積極籌備中、一俟新貨辦到、即可趕製成箱、與駐滬洋行自由交易、故日來本埠洋莊市面、仍在暫時停頓中、惟據一般茶商推測今年新茶山價一定高昻、在產地新茶價格未揭開以前、如能沉着觀　、勿事爭相放價採辦、則營業前途、或有可爲、否則未許樂觀也、</p>

<h3>自昆明取道安南　至星加坡之行程</h3>
<p>— 惲</p>
<p>近年以來，我國交通網綫，日益增密，抗戰軍興，內地交通，尤見發展。所有國內交通情形，已數見本刋記載，惟對於國外與我國內地之交通情形，則尚少發表。按以翁國人之赴歐　者，均自上海或香港轉道，乘郵船前往，即赴英屬馬來半島之星加坡，亦均以航行爲主。茲者，西南各省，已爲國人結集之中心地，昆明貴陽，更成轉赴內地之要道，倘與國外交通的由港滬啟程，不獨時間經濟，兩不相宜，而旅途展轉，亦多勞頓。今探得由昆明取道安南往星加坡之路徑行程，略述如次，或蒙讀者許爲自內地赴國外之捷徑，而加以注意者也。</p>
<p>由昆明首至河內，有滇越鐵路火車，每日開行，班次甚多，本刋上期曾有滇越鐵路行車時刻表之刋載，茲不贅述。抵河內後，改乘法國國有鐵路火車至西貢，行程二日，每日有快車開行。至西貢後再乘五小時之公路汽車即至安南之安哥，再前進抵安南暹羅之邊境，可乘檳暹鐵路火首乘檳暹聯運車至檳城，再乘星檳聯運車直達星加坡。曼谷至星加坡，行程爲三日，票價頭等叻幣八十三元一角九占，二等叻幣四十一元四角九占，三等叻幣廿三元五角四占。總計自昆明首途，直至星加坡，爲時不過七日，當較由港滬轉道，便利不少。又星加坡與昆明間航空，亦能接連，亦附記其行程票價，以供參考：</p>
<p>荷蘭飛機，每逢星期二日中午十二時自星加坡起飛，同日下午四時四十分到西貢，票價叻幣一百二十九元·西貢至河內，有法國飛機，每星期三日上午七時在西貢起飛，同日上午十一時整即達河內，蔡價一千八百法郞。至河內後，有中國航空公司之飛機，每星期三五飛往昆明，三小時可到，票價越幣九十五元。如此則星滇航行，亦僅數日之時間而已。</p>
<h3>內地公路詳記（二）</h3>
<p>— 景洵</p>
<p>貴陽到重慶（海棠溪）</p>
<p>此段公路，是西南公路幹綫的北段；全程共長四八八公里，客車兩大半可達，但是貴陽是各路集中之點，由此到重慶去的旅客很多，雖然這段路上，每天有四輛客車對閒，可是要買到車票，實在不是容易的事。所以旅客都要預先登記，向車站或中國旅行社登記均可，機會碰得巧的時候，一二天就可得到車位；否則大概非一二星期不可。其沿途食宿情形如后：</p>
<p>第一日出貴陽到桐梓，此段距離計長二二一公里，早晨七時，由貴陽出發，中午到烏江渡，汽車要在此渡江。烏江的水，流得很急，渡江很費時候，旅客們就可利用這時間在此進膳，公路局委託中國旅行社在此設立特約烏江食堂，每餐三角，味頗可口。由烏江渡至桐梓，僅數小時，桐梓有中國旅行社辦理的桐梓招待所，設備淸潔衛生，樓上下有分房間，兼有統房，價格一元起至三元五角。第二日由桐梓到綦江，此段距離一八三公里，早晨由桐梓出發，要經過涼風埡，鈎絲岩，九龍山等危險地帶，此段山路崎嶇，一邊是高山，一邊是深谷，很是危險，旅客還是下車走一段，比較安全一些。中午在松坎午膳，晚抵綦江，綦江的招待所正在籌設中，暫時僅可宿於一個特約招待所迎賓旅館，旅客還是自備被單爲宜。第三日由綦江到海棠溪，此段距離僅八四公里，車行三小時卽可到逹。由此渡過長江，就是軍慶了。渡輪每小時往復開行三四次，須時約十分鐘。公路上每人可帮的免費行李是二十公斤，逾量行李，每五公斤取費一元九角八分六厘。（軍慶到貴陽，行程相反，惟公路車山海棠溪出發時刻爲下午一時。）</p>
<p>貴陽到柳州此段是西南公路幹綫的南段，全程共長六三二公里，公路汽車三天可達。此段公路的旅客，沒有北段及西段擁擠，所以購票比較容易，沿途食宿情形如后：</p>
<p>第一日由貴陽到獨山，全程長二三〇公里，行車約十小時可達。中途在馬塲坪用膳，該地是西南公路東綫和南錢的會合食站，膳菜甚爲可口。晚宿獨山，獨山有特約招待所—協安旅館，一宿二餐，取費六角，有改良鋪位十只，每只取費九角。第二日由獨山到河池，此段距離一八一公里，車行約八小時可達。中途在六寨或南丹午膳，此段公路，路面非常崎嶇，且很惡劣，晚宿河池，有中國旅行社河池招待所，設於鳳儀街，離車站僅半里，設備及膳食均佳，可住旅客四十餘人。房金自五角至二元，膳食分五角三角二種。第三日自河池到柳州，距離二二一公里，車行約八小時可達。中途在宜山午膳，下午五時許，就可以到柳州了。免費行李每人准帶二十公斤，逾量行李每五公斤取費一元八角九分六厘。（柳州到貴陽的行程柑反）。—待續—</p>

<p>旅行常識</p>
<h3>乘輪船的種種</h3>
<p>— 琅</p>
<p>選外艙，固然比較空氣好，但是遇到風浪，外艙就比裏艙顚簸得厲寄，要是不怕暈船，儘管選擇外艙。如果怕暈船，還是裹艙好點。</p>
<p>遇到暈船的時候，吃兩個鹹橄欖，效力比暈船藥還要靈。</p>
<p>在船剛剛靠碼頭的時候，大家多爭先恐後的搶着上岸，在這時候，行李最容易失竊，最好鎭靜點,不要忙。</p>
<p>假如你想呌船上的茶房多帮點忙，而且預備多給他點小帳的話，那麼還是請你在上船後就給他。如若能夠滿足他的慾望，那你一路上可就沾光不少。不然，他摸不准你的出手如何，他不會十分幫忙的。</p>
<p>遇到有雙層床鋪的訪間，當然是下鋪比上鋪好。</p>
<p>有的船的被頭，是不很清潔的，如若你蓋不慣的話，最好帶一條被單，把你的身體裹起來。</p>
<p>你如果帶著家眷，不願意到飯廳上去吃飯，請你關照茶房，呌他開到房間裏來，船上有這種待遇，不必多化錢。</p>
<p>船在中途靠岸裝貨或上下客的時候，最好將靠走路一面的窗關上，國為你如果要離開房間，或是要睡覺的話，那麼是最容易失竊的。</p>
<p>有時候茶房會拉你去與不認識的人去賭錢，假如你不是老江湖，還是拒絕為上策。還有生人向你攀談，說話也要特別當心，不可亂講。</p>
<h3>一九三九式　納喜車優點槪述</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>美國納喜汽車，向以　造堅固，機力高强，式樣美妙，裝璜富麗，馳名於世。一九三九年式新車，尤具有驚人之新進步，茲以新納喜即將於月之二十三日抵埠，爰以其特色之犖犖大者，略述如次：</p>
<p>冷熱調節器　當一九三八年式納喜汽車行世時，即已因具有新式通風系而轟動汽車界，蓋因其功能調節空氣，使冬季行車，亦殊和暖，其舒適並無異於置身家庭中也。今則此項發明，幾經研究改良，功用尤爲顯著，蓋現已成爲完全自動之冷熱調節器矣。按此器係表　式，裝於表板之下，祇須隨手一撥，車中氣溫之高低，自可恰如已意，冬暖夏凉，彌感舒適。目經此調節而獲得恰爲已所需要之溫度，不論氣候風向及車行速率若何，並可保持於不變。至在夏季，則車內空氣通暢，極感凉爽，而車窗則儘可緊閉，以免風雨灰沙或虫豸之侵襲。</p>
<p>機力充沛　新納喜之引擎，逈不同於其他引擎，即如以進汽管而言，普通均係敞露於外，無所掩蔽，致汽紅內充滿煤氣化合物，而引擎遂不克產生始終一致之最大功能，惟新納喜則不然，其進汽管係嚴密封裹於引擎內，是以每只汽缸，始終得有相同之溫度，而所受煤氣化合物之影響則極少。凡此蓋皆與引擎效能之高强，具有密切關係者。新納喜引擎，採用雙發火系，具有旋風般之原動力，瀰漫充實，動作敏妙，得未曾有。藎如以是趾輕輕一觸，遂即可由緩緩前進，一變而爲疾駛如飛。</p>
<p>簡易調排　新納喜汽車，調排彌極簡易，其新式調排裝置，裝配於轉向柱上，恰在轉向盤下，其運用方法，一如舊式調排桿，而靈便遠過之。駕駛人之手，甚至可無須離開轉向槃，而仍能迅速調排，且極準確而自然。再因調排桿現已不復存在，故踏脚處一無阻絆，倍覺寬敞，置身駕駛座上，自然得心應手，更能應付裕如。再因新納喜汽求，裝有新式自動第四擋排，故於時速四十英里時，引擎之速率，自可减少百分之三十，不致因速率過高而受損，而車則安然疾馳，如飛而過。至於燃料，並可因此而節省百分之二十五，機油則且節省百分之五十。</p>
<p>安全舒適　新納喜汽車之全部機構，極精細縝密優越之至，故不論以何種速率，行駛於何種路上，胥極穩靜安適。至其純鋼構造之車身，運用靈活之塞車，簡易準確之調排，以及無往而不得心應手之駕駛操縱等，蓋皆新納喜汽車絕對安全可靠之重要因素也。</p>
<p>新納喜汽車，具有如許優點；而其式樣之美妙，裝璜之富麗，設備之齊全，以及內部之寬敞等，並皆達於極點，故其適合汽車界人士之需要，而博得熱烈之歡迎，殆爲當然之結果。納喜汽車，係由本埠靜安寺路一四六〇號大通汽車公司經理，該公司刻正積極裝修佈置，日內即將正式開幕。</p>

<h3>東京自殺之羣</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>十九日東京電：據東京首都警察廳統計，一九三八年內，東京自殺者達一千四百九十八人，自殺未遂者三百八十六人，總計一千八百八十四人。此種自殺之羣，僅僅限於東京一隅之地，若以日本全國統計，正不知幾個或竟幾十個「一千八百八十四人」矣。</p>
<p>此種自殺之羣，其自殺之緣由，該警察處雖未曾公布，無由得知，然亦可猜測其一二矣。日本自侵華以來，完全以戰勝國自居，則其人民應欣欣向榮，樂生怕死，以享受戰勝國之幸福，求生不暇，　論求死？夫人至於不欲生而自殺，則其內心之痛苦為何如？</p>
<p>人民所期求者，祇有安居樂業四字，窮兵黷武，妄動干戈，素為人民所反對。自從「七七」事變以來，日本人民被軍閥逼迫而上火線苦，不知凡幾；其間父兄子弟，朋友親戚，戰死於槍林彈雨中者，又不知凡幾！好好人家子弟，好好人家父兄，好好人家親戚朋友，被軍閥逼迫而去當兵，去上前線，去充炮灰，活躍而來，死灰而去，試問何來？即使未被逼迫上前線的婦人女子，以及未成成之幼童，步履難艱之老弱，身處國中，生活困難，工資低落，物價高漲，中小產業，相繼崩潰，限制消費，加重負擔，物質精神，兩感痛苦，此種日子，確亦難過，與其惡生，不若一死，索性自殺，了此一生，自殺之羣，宜其多也。</p>
<p>更聞駐守我國淪陷區域之日軍，一聞調上　　之訊，莫不抱頭大哭，或互相自殺者，亦不知有幾個或幾十個「一千八百八十四人」？日本人民如是死法，我深為日本人民悲，我更為日本軍閥懼。總之此種情形，無非受日本軍閥之賜，驅數百萬健兒於炮火炸彈之中，以填塞個人之欲　，欲以殺人，先以自殺，此是因果律所支配，莫可逃循者也。試問自殺之羣，為何而死？</p>
<p>社會一角</p>
<h3>汽車裏的家</h3>
<p>— 震</p>
<p>沿著海防路向東走，穿過戈登路，便有一段泥路，開闢了沒有成功。陰雨天，泥濘得很難舉步，中間連一塊小石子都沒有。兩邊盡是些低矮的瓦屋或茅屋，那些不是從前鄉鎮的遺物，便是新搭建的避難所，廣集著那流著血汗的一羣，天天在飢餓線上掙扎。</p>
<p>就在路口轉灣的地方，遠望著有一輛汽車停著，但當你跑近去時，便不禁會失笑，呵！那是一輛破舊的汽車空殼呀！</p>
<p>車子外面的綠漆，還沒有錄蝕完盡，玻璃車胎全沒有了，窗上糊著申報紙，裏面雜堆著破絮和草席——他們所有財產的一切。車外靠牆，是起坐舉炊的地方，車子是臥房。晴天還好，雨天，他們便只能搬到老遠屋簷下去躲著，煮熟兩餐賴以果腹的稀粥，和補綴僅有的幾件破衣裳，天晚了，才鑽進車裏去，他們沒有力量買一幅布幕，有了布幕，孩子便沒有衣服了。靠著男人拉老虎車所入，一家五口維持著生活。</p>
<p>故鄉的景象，逃生的經歷，時時在他們腦海裏憧憬。西面　紗廠的旗子，每次升起來時，他們總得罵上一回。之外，他們還有什麼怨望和幻想呢？寒冷在他們是不能企求躲避的，因為他們是窮人。他們還該是多麼幸運呢，隣居們不盡多著在沒有屋頂底地方過夜的嗎？</p>
<h3>賣花女</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“Pygmalion”</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品　國泰戲院開映</p>
<p>蕭翁是上海人熟知的幽默大師，一九三三年時，他曾到過上海，這本「賣花女」是他一九一二年寫成的舞臺劇；一九一三年上演，曾得到過熱烈的歡迎。一九二五年他曾得過諾貝爾文學獎金，這次「賣花女」劇本，雖然好萊塢電影術科學院給予最優獎，但他卻拒絕接受。蕭翁認為好萊塢是影公司只知道賺錢，因此他的劇本總不肯交給美國電影公司攝制。這次「賣花女」雖然由米高梅公司擔任攝制，但蕭翁卻提出一點，就是所有演員必須是英國人，而米高梅公司為了鄭重攝制起見，特地到英國去攝制。</p>
<p>關於蕭翁著作，思想，中國出版界已有過很多介紹，我們想不必再多事贅述了。這本「賣花女」林語堂先生很早曾經為「開明」翻譯過，但現在已經買不到了。</p>
<p>但以這次「賣花女」的成績來看，這確是一　近來少見的文藝電影。整個影片，除了使觀眾浸潤在諷刺幽默的對話中間以外，同時劇本編制非常優越，比如：（一）寫語音學教授海根，教授賣花女語言的六個月中，它所運用手腕，非常簡練，安只是割取每一片段教授的過程，來寫賣花女怎樣在學習；（二）賣花女第二次試驗時期，某少年曾數度來記問賣花女，劇本上在這晨只有女傭人口中的要見賣花女，而始終不使他出場，直到賣花女由海根家中出來，說預備結婚去，才由海根眼中，看見賣花坐上某少年的汽車。在這裏才介紹出某少年的出場；（三）寫賣花女內心的痛苦，由參與公使宴會回來，只聽見海根與某將軍的哄笑，而賣花女卻痛苦地伏在椅子上流著眼淚；這裏有海根等漠不關心，來對照賣花女的自覺性與她對於海根等的痛恨。這種心理描寫，是夠動人而且是深入的。</p>
<p>本片導演，除了李思　霍華自己以外，同時還有愛通尼·愛斯叩。以演出水淮，以及導演運用的手法看，「賣花女」確是達到了優越的地步。我們不妨舉出幾個例子來看：（一）當賣花女訓練成熟以後，她由家裏奔出來，她穿的是一件貴族婦人衣服，她回到她從前舊生活骯髒的街道上，一個賣花驚訝地想喊她名字，馬上又縮回來，她遞給她一朵花，她在皮夾裏摸出錢來給她，那條灰黯的街道，和賣花女馬上和她現在生活起了一個強烈的對照；（二）當賣花婦被領到浴室中間洗澡的時候，我們只看見她不肯脫及服，直到她被拉住推進浴缸的時候，賣花女大聲的叫起來，鏡頭由樓廊下滑到樓下海根和某將軍仰著頭在聽賣女的呌聲，這裏用聲音介紹出海根站在樓下已聽得很久；（三）在教授賣花女發音的訓練過程中，以賣花女夢中，回憶白天的教授情形，導演者用了多樣的角度，去攝取海根教授時的姿態，它給人的印像，非常明朗而挑撥的。</p>
<p>在所有畫面編織及情感氣氛描寫過程中，都可以看出本片導演人對於全片處理之卓絕與成功。</p>
<p>兩個主要角色，本思廉翟華及溫黛希拉演得都非常成功，溫黛希拉的演技，更為動人而細膩。</p>
<p>這是一張成功的文藝影片，愛好蕭翁作品及電影藝術的，應該去欣賞一下這張影片。</p>
<h3>上海市美術界義賣救難</h3>
<p>— 庸我</p>
<p>下月十二日起在大新公司開展覽會</p>
<p>合名作家二百人　集結晶品兩千件</p>
<p>我國自發動全面搞戰以來。已經過了二十一月，始終是以長期持久的抗戰來消耗對方的戰鬥力。而獲取最後的勝利。然而難胞們一天天的增加，苦痛的生活，一天天的延長，誰見了似乎都感到不安的，但這些也是我們意料中的事實，為了爭取整個國家的生存，對於私有的損失，自然是在所不計。不過他們目前一時的生活，不得不仰給於當地慈善家們的賑濟，才能夠難持下去。</p>
<p>在當今的孤島上，所有的難胞，大都是在宿在難民怕裏，飯雖是勉強有得食了，衣雖是勉強有得穿了，但他們也需要受教育和從事生產，使難胞們有學識，有技能，個個能生產，人人能自立，不賴他人為活。中國工商業美術作家協會有鑒於斯，為貢獻同人之棉力，以謀孤島上難胞前途的幸福計，將舉行一次「上海市美術界義賣救難」的展覽會。救濟的辦法，花分兩種：甲等，除開支外，全部捐助難胞，以作教育與生產的基金：乙等，除開支外，半數捐助難胞，半數提回出品人。筆者為了欲明了該會籌備的內容，特地在昨天下午到該會會所去作一度訪問，由該會的常務委員顧廷王　昌兩君，陪同談話。茲將所得數點，記述於後：</p>
<p>關於此次富有偉大意義的展覽會，該會已籌備就緒，定於下月十二日起假座南京路大新公司四樓陳列室內舉行，限期十天。所參加的團體，計有：都錦生絲絨公司，生生美術公司，黎明工業公司等各大著名團體。展覽的種類，計分：工藝美術，美術工藝品，商業美術，美術商藝品，還有國畫，西畫，雕塑，攝影，及臘染，古玩等。展覽的數景，共選精緻的作品計兩千多件。參加的作家，有汪亞塵，都錦生，杭　英，顧廷康，五　昌，孫雪泥，顏文樑，王守仁，戈湘風等二百多位名作家。</p>
<p>此次該會所舉行的展覽會，據雲已經過了相當時間的籌備，範圍頗大，種類繁多，會合各名作家的結晶品，　集古今珍貴藝術的傑作。定價方面，力求減低，以資普及。所以這次的展覽會，確是給愛好古今西洋藝術欣賞家一個不可多得的機緣，同時也是一個既獲珍品，又惠難胞，一舉二得的好機會。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回　是幻是真逢場作戲　宜行宜止到處為家</p>
<p>金澹雲來了，又添了許多熱鬧。和何家姊妹，小別了幾天，此刻又聚在一處了。據說她兩天是很忙，因為前幾天在上海招待這位美國　　蘇理雅太太，又回到上海來了。原來蘇理雅太太的父親，本來是個美國大富豪，他的所以致富之由，就是在中國貿易上起家的。後來嫁了蘇理雅先生，蘇裏雅先生也是很願意在中國投資，可惜蘇理雅先生，在某一次航海飛行中，飛機失事，受傷身故了。但是蘇理雅太太的父親，只有她一個女兒，卻沒有兒子，所有遺產，除了一小部份捐助公益以外，一大部份的卻是歸他女兒蘇理雅太太。不但此也，蘇理雅先生也是一位美國的钜商，雖然資產不及他的丈人峰，千餘萬美金的資產，也是有的。而且蘇理雅先生也沒有兒子，只有一位女兒，名字喚作曼玲，現在還在美國大學校讀書。因此蘇理雅太太的手裏，四五千萬美金的資產是有的。蘇理雅太太年青的時候，跟隨了她的父親，也曾到過中國。自從嫁了以後，卻不曾來過，一直到蘇先生過世以來，她又為了她的女兒求學問題，她也不願意離開她。此刻女和也長成了，她所以到中國來遊歷，投資中國，也所以竟她的父夫未竟之志。到了中國，有許多人知道蘇理雅太太是位資本家，極力和她周旋。大家都要招她的股份，請她投資，但蘇理雅太慶雖則有錢，不是馬馬虎虎的，凡事要審　一下。現在中國新興的事業中，最盛的是開礦。中國的富，最富的是在地皮底下，試想那一個省份，沒有幾處蘊藏最富厚的礦。不論煤礦，鐵礦，金礦，銀礦，銅，錫，鉛，鋅，以及各種各樣的礦，凡是世界各國所有的礦，中國莫不齊有。而中國所有的礦，如銻，如鎢等等，各國倒未必都有。從　因為中國有了這許多礦，不及開採，倒弄得人家垂涎了，要想來奪取，鬧出戰爭等事。這好比一家巨宅中落了，子孫們懶惰不做事，終日仰屋興嗟，其實他們屋後藏鏹很富。金子幾十　，銀幾十缸，那能不使人家眼紅。因此有一種強盜心腸的人，便要想法子來刦奪了。</p>

<h3>胡琴槪論（上）</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>我看到西洋音樂的書，就有無窮的感慨。中國的「祇可意會，不能言傳」的觀念太深了。不但技術上沒有什麼進步，連一本敎人看得懂而可以應用的書都沒有。就是有人把某一種技術，修養得很好，終於沒有記錄的方法，不能保存，後來者並不由此而再進步了。（雖然原因不止這一端。）所以弄得今不如古，越來越糟。怪不得比不上西洋音樂的發達了。我並不反對學習西洋音樂，但我們自己的音樂呢？失了眞傳，可惜不可惜？西洋音樂並不是當初就這樣完備的，也是經過多少次的硏究改良，纔到今日的地步。我對於西洋音樂也曾硏究多少時候，而我對於胡琴則會費了十八年的苦功，到如今還是不能達到理想的目的。假如我硏究了十八年梵珴林，那末我也許會成功一個很有名的提琴家。這並不是胡琴難梵珴林容易，就因爲胡琴的方法並沒有一個可靠的方法來硏究，而且所謂名家者不能天天來敎我，最感到痛苦的就是沒有系統的方法來研究。我現在寫一些關於胡琴的學說，還是很簡單的。我希望將來做成一本有系統有方法的專書。</p>
<p>從賈三說起</p>
<p>皮黃的歷史很短，普遍地應用胡琴還是後來的事，至於最古的胡琴，有人說是彈的，不是拉的。所以皮黃用的胡琴，歷史很淺。因爲沒有專書的考查，先前的現在弄不明白了。就是知道它的歷史，也於實際無益。但是有一件値得紀念的事，就是以前用的弓子上的馬尾，非常之鬆，拉的時候，要繞在手腕上的，因此不能運用腕力，只能直僵僵的像鋸木頭的神氣。自從買三起，發明用硬弓，即將馬尾扣緊，從此拉法上便利多多。現在有些老徽班，仍奮用老法拉的，實在笨得可笑。賈三有兩個徒弟——梅雨田，孫佐臣。梅雨田我已經聽不到了，但在梅氏傳人陳彥衡先生那裏，體會此當初梅氏的格局和風味來，祇是我不敢下批評因爲究竟我不曾聽到他木人，這祇是閒接的罷了。孫佐臣是一代宗匠，發音很好，作風亦與別人不同。現在還有人學孫氏的一路。不過貌似神非的居多。在格局上改良的，先有陸硯亭，後有徐蘭園先生，創造此種種的方法來，這也是一種進步。後來敝業師王少卿先生出來，完全改變以前的陳套，無論在技術上，思想上，都是前人所沒有的，尤其是他的內在心理特別顯露出　一種精神來，一時影響到全國的琴師，凡是會拉胡琴的人，都因爲他而改變了作風。這是一個藝術界上有功的人物。</p>
<h3>「羅賓漢」導演　威廉凱萊氏將來滬</h3>
<p>— 舒曉春</p>
<p>華納方面現正籌備歡迎凱萊氏將參觀滬戰遺跡</p>
<p>去年十大巨片之一華納出品之「羅賓漢」曾轟動本市十餘萬觀衆，賣座始終不衰，目聞不久將捲土重來，是則未獲觀此片者之絕好佳音也。該片係出諸名導演威康凱萊氏William　Keighley之手，茲悉凱萊氏巳於三月底完成吉姆賈格迺與喬治雷夫脫合演「黎明即死」（暫譯）Each　Dawn　I　Die一片後，即與其新夫人余納弗吐蘋Genevieve　Tobin離好萊塢而作環遊世界之蜜月旅行，五月二日將乘日本皇后號由神戶來滬，盤桓數日，定於五日去港，然後搭機飛西貢，新夫人吐蘋於凱萊氏導演之「少女的煩悶」Yes,My　Darling　Daunbler一片中，飾潘立茜拉藍之姑母，該片即將於下月十一日起公映於國泰云。</p>
<p>凱萊夫婦抵滬時，將下榻於國際飯店，華納駐滬當局，刻正在籌備歡迎，聞凱萊氏除參觀滬上著名戲院如大光明，國泰等，及大舞塲如麗都仙樂等外，幷將往閘北一觀滬載戰跡。</p>
<p>凱萊氏從事戲劇工作，垂廿二年，其中任演員十二年，導演十年，故其經騐豐富，宜共成爲著名導演也。氏生於美國費城，自幼愛好戲劇藝術，迨受完敎育後，即加入劇團，勝演莎翁諸名劇，當時旅行劇團均採用古舊劇本，氏獨首先以自編之新型近代劇本，如：「理想而已」Just　Suppose等十餘齣，售之與却但蘇士且大半均由氏自任導演或演員，氏曾往巴黎硏究法國舞台劇二年，返紐的後，與霍蒲金導演」善於辯白The　Perfect　Aibil劇，旋又往倫敎導演若千劇本，重返紐的後即導演Penny　Arcade，明星瓊白朗台兒及吉姆賈格迺均由氏提拔而成名，該劇權爲亞爾喬生所有，喬生售之與華納，氏遂同之至好萊塢，於是氏導演「大飯店」Grand　Hotel「伊立莎白皇后」Elizabete　the　Queen等名劇，幷爲勞州之勃拉斯哥Belasco戲院導演「明日復明日」To-morrow　&amp;　To-morrow一劇，又爲立却賓納譯法名劇Cyrano　de　Bergerae，幷導演之。</p>
<p>氏之學識經騐，旣如此豐富，於是聲譽日隆，華納公司延聘之，初爲劇務指導，旋任顧問導演，以資實習，良以導演影片與導演舞台劇，略有不同故也。五年前氏始獨自導演「水性楊花」自此以後，氏導演之名片頗多，如：「大學遊藝會」「乞丐皇帝」「靑山紅粉」「開天闢地」「歌壇風月」「一身是胆」「直搗黃龍」「軍校風光」「巨人谷」及最近將公映於國泰之「少女的煩悶」等，巨片「羅賓漢」即氏與蜜茜寇迪司之傑作也。</p>
<p>氏於去歲（一九三八年）與吐蘋結稱，同住於白倫塢Brentwood一不甚華麗但很舒適之住宅中，最近且築一游泳池，於是不必遠出，即可享受其愛悅之運動矣。</p>

<p>舞國寫影（十九）</p>
<p>— 小田</p>
<h3>眞美善</h3>
<p>我在二年前會經替樂天集紀念特刋寫過一篇文章，題目是戲劇三原則眞美善，這動機是因爲看了鄉前輩曾孟撲所著說部「眞美善」纔聯想釗的，咋天看見本報仙樂舞宮所登廣告，也用着眞美善做標題，另有聲光座三個小字，綴在上面，不知是否聲眞光美座善的意思。仙樂這位主持廣告的先生，或許也是因曾先生說部而聯想到的罷？至於我那一篇東西，文旣不佳，流傳亦少，決沒有被人採用的價値。</p>
<p>我認爲無論何神藝術，若要使人感動，總逃不出眞美善三項條件，換句話說，若能具備眞美善三條件而不能引人入勝者，未之有也。梨園中人，常有假戲眞做之說，前些時卡爾登排演溫如玉一劇，台下觀眾涕泣聲，幾乎勝過台上絃歌聲，這就是眞字的動人處，那末舞塲的眞美善父常怎麼說呢，且就　見所及，來剖釋一下，對與不對，尚待高明指示。</p>
<p>舞塲之當美化，盡人皆知，墻壁之裝璜，桌椅之配置，舞池之地板，燈光之色調，音樂之悅耳，舞女之服裝，身段容貌，在在須事講求，舞客是硬繃繃的，你若不使他感到滿意，拉也拉不到來，這其問就不曉要絞盡幾許人的腦汁，仙樂在謝葆生先生未接辦以前，常慮虧蝕，現在却常有贏餘，這不是什麼額角頭亮暗的關係，你若到仙樂去仔細硏究一下，關於美的條件，的確改良得不少。</p>
<p>眞和善的條件，從膚淺地看來，似乎與舞塲有些風馬牛不相及，但若切實推究，徒美是不能算完備的，譬如將臘像做成一個蛟全塲舞女更美的模型，總沒有人會化錢把她搬過來坐抬子，再如一個較美的舞女以惡意相待，而另一舞女則以善意相待，即使其美稍遜，我想大多數人，總也樂於就意善而姿美稍遜的了。我現在再來下個斷語曰：眞者，誠也，不欺也。善若，無惡意也，常見幾家影戲院，廣告上載着塲塲客滿·火速購票，這恐不及等字樣，及至光觀其地，則座客　若晨星，其實所映的片子，也並不怎樣不好，不過已引起了顧客一種不良印象，以後的廣告，就减少效力了。</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to news from the front lines, Japanese troops are moving towards Yueyang from Wuchang by land and water, and from Chongyang towards Tongshan. At the same time, Japanese troops along the Nanxun Railway are also moving west. This shows that Japanese troops in northern Hunan are preparing to attack. Japanese troops in Dongting Lake are extremely active. According to the Chinese side, the Japanese will attack along Dongting Lake and western Hunan, while simultaneously attacking Changsha from Yueyang. According to reports, fierce guerrilla warfare has broken out near Guihua and Baotou on the Pinghan and Pinggui Railways, and both railways have been cut off by guerrillas.

Then, Chinese troops launched a surprise guerrilla attack, and the Japanese troops were caught off guard and retreated back to Tongshan City, with many Japanese soldiers killed. One machine gun and over ten rifles were captured. (21st Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Times Discusses the New Chinese Offensive: The Goal of Attrition Warfare Against Japan Has Been Achieved</h3>
<p>(London) After studying the achievements of the Chinese counter-offensive, The Times commented: "The importance of the Chinese counter-offensive should not be underestimated or overestimated, either of which would be a major mistake. There is ample evidence that China's spirit remains extremely high after two years of defeat, and there is no need to list them all. This new offensive is a clear demonstration of its careful preparation and adjustment. The progress in Kaifeng is more important than the encirclement of Guangzhou, because it can shatter the Japanese hope of bringing Wu Peifu out. Even if the Chinese army's recapture of Guangzhou may not be realized, the counter-offensive in the south has reached its goal within a non-negligible scope by imposing on the Japanese side the casualties of soldiers, the consumption of armaments, and the extension of time. Now the Chinese army is obviously making good progress towards this goal." (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chinese General Counteroffensive Has Not Yet Begun</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reporters who have learned from military authorities, although our troops on all fronts have begun to attack and actively engage this month, the overall general counteroffensive has not yet begun. The current objective of our army's operations is to utilize mountainous terrain to lure Japanese troops in, waiting to attract the majority of the Japanese main force to appropriate areas, where weapons lose their effectiveness, and then give full play to our army's advantages, giving the Japanese army a major blow and gradually losing its combat capability. Until recently, this situation, which is beneficial to our army, has gradually formed, and our army has begun to launch fierce attacks on each front. In the past twenty days, more than seventy important towns have been recovered, and the magnitude of the war results has truly caused national encouragement and excitement. As for the conquered cities, such as Zengcheng in Guangdong, Gao'an, which was once conquered in northern Jiangxi, Yixing and Pixian in Jiangsu, Kaifeng, which was repeatedly stormed into in Henan, Nangong, which was conquered in Hebei, and Monanzhen Ruicheng Anze Xiaxian, which were repeatedly conquered in Shanxi, all these counties and towns are important military strongholds, and now they have been recovered by us in sequence, and its significance is extremely important. This not only shows the enhancement of our military strength and the prosperity of morale, but also fully exposes the weakening of the Japanese military strength. Therefore, public opinion from various countries has repeatedly praised us. After setbacks, the Japanese army made a big statement in Tokyo Broadcasting, saying that our army (the general counteroffensive in April) had failed, which is not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. Our army has indeed made considerable preparations for the general counteroffensive, and has accumulated small victories into big victories, and the posture of the war of resistance is also forming day by day. However, now is not the time for our army's general counteroffensive. (21st Telegram)</p>

<h3>Launching an Anti-Wang Movement</h3>
<p>Today, as the National Spiritual Mobilization is being implemented, an anti-Wang movement should be launched immediately. Anti-Wang means anti-traitors. Only anti-Wang is the most concrete manifestation of the concentration of the will of the entire Chinese people at the current stage.</p>
<p>To recognize the necessity of the anti-Wang movement, one must first eliminate all excuses for Wang Zhaoming's treasonous actions. Some people think that Wang Zhaoming's absurd behavior is nothing more than a momentary mistake of observation, and that his motives are generally understandable. In fact, Wang Zhaoming's treasonous activities had a predetermined plan, so he repeatedly published bizarre remarks, and finally colluded with Konoe to act as the Japanese warlords' internal support. After the treasonous traces were revealed, he did not show any remorse, but instead intensified his efforts, forged documents, spread rumors, and instigated his cronies to carry out reactionary organizations. Can this kind of planned and step-by-step action be regarded as a momentary mistake of observation? Other people cherish Wang Zhaoming's past political life, and believe that although he is currently acting against the tide, it is okay to treat him with leniency. In fact, to forgive a person is nothing more than hoping that he can repent. Since Wang Zhaoming will not repent, what is the use of forgiving him? Moreover, a person's good or evil depends entirely on the final performance. Although Wang Zhaoming's body has not yet reached the time of covering the coffin, his spirit has already concluded his life. He has already presented himself as a traitor who seeks glory by selling his country. Even if there were one or two small acts of kindness in the past, how can it cover up his final treachery? What's more, Wang Zhaoming's entire history is full of speculation. In order to exert his desire for leadership, he is used to doing things that change his mind and turn his face faster than the weather. He can't even find a little bit of kindness and trust. What can we cherish about him? Still other people think that Wang Zhaoming has no mass support except for a few henchmen, and that his remarks are only personal actions that will not have any effect at all. It is okay to let him destroy himself, why should we pay so much attention to him? In fact, Wang Zhaoming really has no mass support, and he is really not worth paying attention to. However, he is now a tool of the Japanese warlords, and his masters have taken out a portion of money from their pitiful pockets to promote him and win over ugly people, with a major conspiracy. At the same time, his cronies are also actively working, planning to use their tricks in print or in the education world to carry out their conspiracy to confuse people's minds. If this is not prevented and allowed to grow, it is not allowed in the process of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>We only need to read Wu Zhihui's writing rebuking Wang Zhaoming to know how he painstakingly planned to sell out the nation and the country, how he acted as the Japanese warlords' internal support, destroying his political life, and how he did not know how to repent and continued to carry out his conspiracy. Therefore, every Chinese should know that Wang Zhaoming is an unforgivable traitor, and forgiving a traitor is a crime.</p>
<p>Since Wang Zhaoming offered his "friendly" country a plan to destroy China, Japan has begun to launch new offensives in Jiangxi and other places since early March. However, in addition to repeatedly declaring its firm stance on resisting Japan, the Chinese government is also launching counter-offensives when the Japanese are losing their strength, and is winning victories one after another, which is tantamount to shattering the joint conspiracy of the Japanese warlords and Wang Zhaoming. However, this is still not enough. Chinese citizens should combine the universal anti-Wang movement with the government's actions, so that Wang Zhaoming's conspiracy will not only be shattered temporarily, but will never happen again.</p>
<p>The content of the anti-Wang movement should be to eliminate all traitorous theories. First, resistance to Japan is a national policy, and victory in the war of resistance is an inevitable result. The facts of the past twenty-one months have proved that China has not been defeated at all, but Japan has embarked on a path of collapse. Therefore, there is no such thing as "both sides are hurt," and there is no peace to be talked about before the goal of victory is achieved. If you talk about peace, you are a traitor. Second, China's united front is based on the needs of facts, and is currently growing and enriching, without any signs of rupture. Even after the war of resistance is over in the future, China will still build a brand-new Three People's Principles republic in the trenches of the united front, and there is no possibility of rupture. Those who make unnecessary worries about China's future are also traitors. In the anti-Wang movement, everyone should be responsible for reporting traitorous theories and correcting them.</p>
<p>The anti-Wang movement should be universal and organized. It should be combined with the National Spiritual Mobilization and serve as one of the essential items for the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. As for Shanghai, the education community should lead this anti-Wang movement, and the education community itself should first carry out a thorough ideological anti-corruption movement, because the nature of the anti-Wang movement is the conscious pursuit of truth, which is most suitable for the education community to lead, and it is also widely rumored that Wang's cronies are trying to carry out conspiracies in Shanghai's education community and inject ideological poisons.</p>
<p>The anti-Wang movement should be expanded as much as possible to the guerrilla areas, because in the areas controlled by the Japanese and puppet regimes, Chinese compatriots are subject to the blockade of knowledge, and it is not easy to understand the current situation in China. At the same time, the Japanese and puppet regimes are also actively carrying out anesthetizing and enslaving spiritual training, touting Wang Zhaoming as the savior of the world in the puppet newspapers, and deceiving Chinese compatriots. Therefore, the anti-Wang movement should penetrate the occupied areas, expose the Japanese and puppet regimes' intentions to tout Wang, publicize the true meaning of the war of resistance, and release the spiritual imprisonment of the suffering compatriots by all possible means.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Disappointed: US Lodges Another Protest Against Japan; Demands Restoration of Navigation on the Yangtze River and Freedom for American Nationals in Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US fleet has concentrated in the Pacific. According to Secretary of State Hull yesterday, the US, in an attempt to allow American nationals in Japanese-occupied areas in China to obtain more freedom, may again lodge an urgent protest with Japan. At the same time, Under Secretary of State Welles met with Japanese Ambassador Kensuke Horinouchi and questioned him about the Japanese promise to open the Yangtze River. Hull also said that the Yangtze River issue is one of the main points of the protest that the United States will raise. This protest will be submitted to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs by US Ambassador to Japan Grew. (21st Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the rights of Americans on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, State Department official Welles has made a verbal protest to the Japanese government. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi visited the State Department at Welles' invitation. Welles expressed to the ambassador that the US government was quite dissatisfied with the "restrictions on the activities of Americans in the area" and asked the Japanese side to respect the rights of American merchants and missionaries on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Secretary of State Hull then told reporters that US Ambassador to Japan Grew might therefore negotiate with the Japanese government. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press, saying that it is unfair that Japanese military authorities do not allow American merchants to travel freely in the occupied areas of China, while Japanese merchants can come and go freely. I have protested to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi, and have ordered the US Ambassador to Japan Grew to protest to the Japanese government. US officials in China will also negotiate with local Japanese authorities. It is reported that Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently issued a statement, saying that since Japan has discriminated against American interests, the United States should implement various economic measures as retaliatory means to be applied to Japanese commerce. The US government has protested to Japan again, which, in the eyes of diplomatic circles here, is not unrelated to Pittman's above-mentioned statement. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan to Issue Another ¥300 Million in Public Bonds; Over 50,000 People Violate Raw Materials Control Regulations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) March 31 was the last day of Japan's 1938-39 fiscal year. On that day, the total amount of debt owed by the Japanese government was ¥17,344,853,000, of which domestic debt accounted for ¥16,065,138,000 and foreign debt accounted for ¥1,279,714,000. These are all long-term loans with collateral, and short-term loans of ¥492,262,000 have not been included. The Japanese government has now decided to issue 300 million Chinese Incident 3.5% bonds on April 25, which will be repaid in seventeen years and three months. The actual receipt is 98, of which 200 million will be absorbed by the government storage bureau, and the remaining 100 million will be purchased by the Bank of Japan. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, in the nine months since the implementation of the National Raw Materials Control Regulations, 54,351 Tokyo citizens have been charged with violating the regulations. As far as people violating the Prohibition of Profiteering Law are concerned, the total number has reached 20,500. A total of 17,473 people have violated the Price Control Regulations. In addition, the number of people in the metal, fuel, cotton textile, leather, rubber, and timber industries who have violated the regulations is also large. Most of them were released after being arrested and given a slight warning. The police department is finding it increasingly difficult to cope with these cases. In the future, it plans to severely punish violators. The most difficult thing to deal with is the issuance of gasoline coupons to car owners. The official regulation stipulates that the price of each gallon of gasoline is 55 sen. Taxis can use 100 to 150 gallons per month and purchase gasoline with coupons. Private cars are only allowed to use 13 gallons of gasoline per month. In order to make profits, taxi drivers have sold the gasoline coupons they obtained to private car owners at a high price of 1 yen 20 sen to 2 yen per gallon. Their income is actually higher than renting out taxis. The authorities are unable to prohibit this, because the control regulations do not have any provisions for this special situation.

<h3>Japan's International Standing Greatly Affected by China's Resistance; Germany Finds Japan No Longer Useful; Japan Unable to Wage War Against Russia</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian wrote today that when Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan in October 1936, it hoped to use it as a new weapon against Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Regardless of the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War, one thing is now certain: Japan today is worth much less as an ally than it was two years ago. The Chinese army is not only far from being exhausted and weakened, but is in fact increasing its strength and conviction. Even the most optimistic Japanese generals cannot predict when the war will end. The recent statements of the Japanese cabinet have been much more moderate than before. If Germany makes sufficient inducements, Japan will naturally join hands with it in any war. However, in this matter, it depends as much on President Roosevelt as it does on Hitler. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's correspondent in Manchuria today made a detailed speculation on the status of the Soviet Union and Japan, and concluded that neither country wants to fight. The correspondent also quoted a spokesman for the Kwantung Army as saying that the possibility of Japan waging war against the Soviet Union depends entirely on the nature of the proposals put forward by Germany.

<h3>The United States Should Treat China and Japan Separately; Discussion of Neutrality Act Amendments; Opinions Expressed by American Scholars and Clergy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The chairman of the American Foreign Policy Association, Mr. Buell, stated yesterday in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that while he strongly agrees with Mr. Pittman's "cash-and-carry" clause, it should be excluded in the Far East to prevent Japan from benefiting. According to Mr. Buell, Japan has a navy and a large number of merchant ships, making it very easy to obtain American munitions and other necessities. Therefore, if Congress adopts Mr. Pittman's approach, it should establish separate provisions to prevent Japan from enjoying this benefit. In order to maintain China's open door policy, humanitarian interests in China, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the status of the Philippines, the United States should indeed consider the China issue separately. Mr. Buell believes that if Germany defeats Britain and France, the United States will become its prey. Therefore, if Britain, France, and China resist the anti-Comintern bloc for one day, the United States can survive for one day. According to Dr. Kidd, a priest who recently returned from China, the United States is actually an accomplice in Japan's current war against China. If the United States refuses to trade with Japan, Japan will be unable to wage war within three months. Moreover, the United States' refusal to allow Japan to obtain American resources is justified by compelling reasons. First, Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty. Second, Japan's current invasion of China is a deliberate and brutal act of destroying culture. Third, if Japan conquers China, it will then seize the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines, as Tokyo's southward expansion claims are very strong. (21st Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who advocated adding the "cash-and-carry" clause to the Neutrality Act amendment, told the Associated Press reporter today that in order to maintain fairness to all countries, he could not compromise on the clause he proposed. "If we want to maintain neutrality, impartiality, or morality, we must choose one of two paths. One path is to ban all shipments to warring countries, except for food and clothing transported by the Red Cross to the people of warring countries. The other path is to implement the "cash-and-carry" method. The current situation between China and Japan clearly shows that banning the shipment of munitions and war materials, or allowing the transport of raw materials, munitions, or war materials to China and Japan, is neither neutral nor moral. We know very well that Japan has the facilities to utilize war materials, while China does not. The same situation will arise when a war occurs between a manufacturing country and a non-manufacturing country. Therefore, I cannot compromise on the "cash-and-carry" clause. Regarding the control of American vessels engaged in trade with warring countries, I am willing to make any reasonable changes." (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Battle for Wuning</h3>
<p>(Changsha) Last September, when the Battle of Wuhan was in full swing, the Japanese army, in order to cover the flank of its troops advancing north through the Ruiwu Highway via the Hubei-Jiangxi line to Yangxin, sent the Kayashima and Muta regiments to attack Fuxueshan, northeast of Wuning, to contain the Chinese forces in Wuning from intercepting them. At that time, the Japanese vanguard once attacked the Luopan and Guancai mountains southwest of Fuxueshan, and occupied the high peaks, making Wuning precarious. Later, the Chinese army's XX and XX units bravely fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army in the deep valleys of the Luopan and Guancai mountains, and the Japanese army's ferocity was initially frustrated, and Wuning turned from danger to safety. Since then, the Chinese and Japanese forces have each occupied half of the Luopan and Guancai mountains. This year in March, the Japanese army planned to capture Nanchang, and transferred troops from southern Hubei to march south along the Jiangxi-Hubei line to participate in the battle, so as not to encounter unexpected events along the way. With about one and a half divisions of troops, they displayed their ferocity and pointed towards the northeast of Chinese-held Wuning from the 20th. Thus, the prelude to the heroic and tragic Battle of Wuning was launched. In both the Wuhan and Nanchang campaigns, the Japanese had to pay serious attention to the Wuning area. During the battle, they had to use heavy troops in that area to conduct supporting attacks. The reasons are: (1) Wuning is located in the middle of the Jiangxi-Hubei line, and the Jiangxi-Hubei line is the center of gravity on which the Japanese army relies to move back and forth to invade the borders of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in the current stage of operations. After all, going through the Nanchang-Jiujiang line along the Yangtze River to</p>
<p>the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is not as direct as going through the Jiangxi-Hubei line. When the Japanese army turns northwest along this line, it must pass through the Daqiao north of Wuning. When turning southeast, it must pass through the Zhuoxi southeast of Wuning. If the Chinese forces occupy Wuning, it is tantamount to driving a wedge into the enemy's center of gravity, and like a pillar, it can interrupt the Japanese's center of gravity at any time, making it unable to maneuver, and even</p>
<p>fall into collapse. Therefore, in both the Wuhan and Nanchang campaigns, the Japanese army had to attack Wuning with heavy troops, and our side did not hesitate to defend it with equal forces. Although this attack by the Japanese army on Wuning began at dawn on the 20th of last month, the noises and neighing of horses in the Zhuoxi and Jinkou areas the night before led the Chinese front-line soldiers to determine that this was a sign that the Japanese army was about to attack, and they were ready to meet the enemy in battle. First, the Chinese troops stationed in the southern part of the Luopan and Guancai mountains took advantage of the period of confrontation with the Japanese army in the north and south to build</p>
<p>solid trenches in front of the positions and completed them later. Luopan and Guancai are east-west mountain areas. The triangle where the Jiangxi-Hubei line and the Zhuoxi-Wuning Highway intersect is blocked by the Xiu River in the south and the Botian River (also known as the Lushui River) in the west, facing the Shuizhoujian, Jiabai, and Wangrenzhou mountains, about fifteen kilometers from Wuning. The Chinese side foresaw that it would be difficult to defend the southern part of Luopan and Guancai for a long time, so they selected a favorable location on the west bank of the Botian River north of the Zhuwu Highway as the battlefield for a bloody battle with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 20th, before the attack began, the Japanese first arranged dozens of artillery pieces of various sizes in the northern part of Luopan and Guancai, and concentrated their fire on the Chinese positions, firing more than 400 rounds. At 9:00 AM, more than 30 Japanese planes continuously bombed the Chinese positions in rotation, dropping light bombs. Afterwards, about two regiments of Japanese troops, using artillery fire as cover, charged specifically towards the southern part of Luopan and Guancai. In addition, more than 200 Japanese troops secretly crossed the Botian River to disrupt the Chinese rear. At this time, huge bombs roared through the air and exploded, and</p>
<p>the thick smoke and dust of the earth-shattering explosions filled the sky, but the brave Chinese soldiers were still able to calmly use machine guns and grenades to fight the Japanese without retreating. After a day of mixed fighting, the Chinese positions remained unmoved. The valley in front of the Chinese positions was full of Japanese corpses, including two Japanese regimental commanders. The few Japanese troops who secretly crossed the Botian River were also wiped out. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>China's Highways and Motor Roads Total Over 72,000 Miles, One Car for Every Mile of Highway, Improvement Work Underway on the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to official figures released here today, China's highways and motor roads currently total 71,240 miles, and the number of cars in China is about 72,000, or about one car per mile.</p>
<p>Recently, the world has been paying attention to China's two international highways in the northwest and southwest. The first is the highway from Lanzhou to Hami, Dihua, and the Soviet border, which is 730 miles long. The second is the highway from Guilin to Nanning and the Vietnamese border, which is 470 miles long. The third highway starts from Kunming, passes through Chuxiong, Baoshan, and reaches Anding (transliteration), and then splits from Anding, reaching Bhamo on the Irrawaddy River to the north, and Lashio on the Burmese railway to the south. The distance from Kunming to Anding is 610 miles, from Anding to Lashio is 160 miles, and from Anding to Bhamo is 110 miles. The last two sections are in Burmese territory. There is direct road traffic from Lashio and Bhamo to Rangoon.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Transportation told a Reuters reporter that the US government has approved a credit loan of US$25 million to China, part of which will be used to maintain the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Yunnan-Burma Road was started by the Yunnan Provincial Government in August 1937. After receiving assistance from the central government last winter, many sections of the road have been passable, but recently, consolidation work has been carried out, such as leveling the road surface and strengthening the roadbed and bridges, so that the entire road is suitable for wartime needs. The spokesman also said that the work of improving the highway is still ongoing, and it is hoped that the road can still be used for transportation in the coming rainy season. There are 200,000 engineers and workers working on the Yunnan-Burma Road, and it takes five days to travel the road by car, passing through 289 bridges carrying 10 to 15 tons and 1,959 culverts. The roadbed is 9 to 16 feet wide, the maximum gradient is 8%, the shortest bend radius is 50 feet, and the maximum altitude is 8,520 feet above sea level. The location is about 60 miles from Xiaguan and 257 miles from Kunming. It is estimated that the initial construction of the road cost about 5 to 6 million yuan, and now an additional 10 million yuan has been allocated to meet the needs of improvement, equipment, and traffic.

<h3>People Must Greet Wounded Soldiers with Respect, Joint Order from the Military, Interior, and Education Ministries</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, China's loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting heroically on the battlefield, fulfilling their duty to defend the country. Those who are wounded in battle and come to the rear for treatment should be deeply respected by the people. The military service conference in February of this year passed a resolution that the people of the whole country should salute wounded soldiers at any time and in any place. The military, interior, and education ministries have now jointly ordered all military, government, and educational organizations and groups across the country to instruct their subordinates to comply, and the Political Department of the Military Commission has ordered political departments at all levels to explain this to the soldiers and strictly comply with it. The original proposal is as follows: "Whenever and wherever you meet a wounded soldier, salute him with respect. Those in military police uniforms, student uniforms, long gowns, or other casual clothes should take off their hats and bow with attention. Those without hats should nod." Those receiving the salute should return the salute. (21st dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Authorities Analyze Roosevelt's Plan, Disappointed with Mussolini's Speech, But Believe There is Still Room for Maneuver</h3>
<p>(Washington) An official of the State Department stated today that although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's rejection of President Roosevelt's peace proposal was disappointing, there was still room for cooperation. If the US President is willing to proceed with his proposal to guarantee peace and convene a conference to resolve international disputes, then a basis for continued progress can be found in the part of Mussolini's speech that expressed peaceful intentions. Although Mussolini belittled the value of convening a conference, he did not completely reject such a proposal. According to President Roosevelt's plan, the largest conference should discuss economic issues, the disarmament conference should be limited to countries with strong military power, and the political conference should be limited to directly related European countries. President Roosevelt had already mentioned in his appeal for peace that three types of conferences should be convened to consider disarmament, economic, and political issues respectively. State Department officials expect that Hitler's response to the US President will be largely the same as that of the Italian Prime Minister, but it will be longer and will mention the replies he may receive from the Balkan countries, as Hitler has now asked the Balkan countries whether they feel threatened by Germany.

Prime Minister Mussolini's reference to "geographical absurdity" is probably a new argument for the demands made by Germany and Italy. These demands are already familiar, namely that Germany and Italy have limited resources and cannot maintain the status quo, and must expand their influence to the detriment of other countries. In this regard, President Hitler will make a more detailed explanation when he delivers a speech on the 28th of this month. This time, Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed his views and delegated the responsibility of formally responding to President Roosevelt to his partner, so it is clear who is the leader of the German-Italian axis. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) After Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered his speech today, Secretary of State Hull only saw the gist of it in the newspapers and refused to comment on it. The State Department also said that it is not known whether this speech by the Italian Prime Minister is the only response to President Roosevelt's telegram of the 14th of this month. In the newspapers, everyone condemned it, saying that the Italian Prime Minister's words were a direct rejection of President Roosevelt's appeal. However, diplomatic circles said that when Germany and Italy submit their replies, it cannot be expected that they will give a clear "yes or no." After all, even if dictators express compromise, they must do so in a forceful manner in order to please their domestic public opinion. In addition, everyone generally said that since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is unwilling to provide a guarantee that he will not engage in aggression within a certain period of time, it will not be difficult to designate who is the aggressor if a dispute occurs in the future and Italy does participate. The only hope now is that the Italian Prime Minister will send a formal reply to President Roosevelt through diplomatic channels. As for the speech he gave today, it may be regarded as a strategy to elicit reactions in the United States and the world, so as to gauge public opinion in order to formally draft a reply.

<p>(Paris) The speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday has just been commented on by the newspapers here, which said that this is a "temporary answer." Although the tone is still mild, it is not enough to arouse optimism. In addition, the date for General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, to enter Madrid in a triumphal procession has been postponed again (originally scheduled for May 2nd, then changed to the 15th, and now changed to the 30th). The German fleet will also sail to Spanish waters. All of this should be paid close attention to. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here today prominently published a Berlin dispatch, saying that it has been learned from reliable sources that Germany recently sent troops to various places due to the tense international situation, but they have now all been recalled to their original locations, indicating that the German side believes that the situation has eased.

<h3>Anglo-French-Russian Military Alliance; Soviet Russia Proposes a Counter-Proposal; The British Side Finds It Somewhat Difficult; But It Will Not Affect Negotiations</h3>
<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph claims that the constructive measures proposed by the Soviet Union seem to prove, without doubt, that the Soviet Union is willing to join the Anglo-French proposal to resist dictatorial aggression in Europe with all its strength and resources, without reservations or restrictions. However, the Soviet proposal may raise some technical difficulties. It is reported that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, suggested to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov that the Soviet Union guarantee assistance to Poland and Romania in any most convenient way. Moscow was still hesitant about this suggestion last week and doubted the actual value of Britain's guarantee to Poland and Romania. Now things are different. The British Cabinet must now consider how the Soviet proposal will affect the known attitudes of various small countries and their political and geographical situations. It will take several days of study before Britain can answer Moscow with its findings. A Berlin dispatch claims that if Britain strengthens its relations with the Soviet Union, Hitler's opportunity to issue a peace speech in a week will be eliminated. This insinuation will not stop the British government from exchanging diplomatic opinions with the Soviet Union. (21st Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The British government is negotiating with the Soviet Union to form an anti-aggression bloc, intending to have the country accept unilateral constraints to protect its neighbors from aggression. It is learned that the Soviet government has already proposed a counter-proposal, which is being studied by the British Cabinet. It is reported to contain four points: (1) If Eastern and Western Europe want to form an anti-aggression bloc, the participating countries must establish an agreement that is automatically implemented and unite with each other. Regarding this, the current British foreign policy seeks to avoid automatic constraints in order to appease Romania and Poland. (2) The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an unconditional mutual assistance agreement, which should be supplemented by an agreement established by the general staff of each country. This is the only possible basis for a collective security system. (3) The security guarantees provided by the United Kingdom and France to Romania and Poland apply to any aggression that any country may impose on these countries. This inevitably makes the Soviet Union suspected of being an aggressor and should be revised to serve as a guarantee against Germany. (4) Poland and Romania should first establish a military agreement specifically to prevent German aggression, and then the Soviet Union can provide guarantees to these countries. The initial impression obtained by the British responsible party is not very bad, believing that the Soviet Union is sincere in participating in a collective security organization. However, according to the counter-proposal, Germany must be clearly designated as the aggressor, then the peace group has almost become an encirclement front. Not only can Germany cite this as an excuse, but Romania and Poland may not be willing to accept it. In addition, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are even less likely to support British policy. Therefore, even some British cabinet members who are considering concluding an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union are hesitant. However, Turkey is eagerly looking forward to the establishment of an agreement between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and the participation of the Soviet Union is essential for the formation of an anti-aggression bloc. The British government may seek a compromise solution so that the Soviet Union agrees to cooperate, and other countries can also accept it. (20th Havas)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the question of the organization of the anti-aggression bloc, foreign countries have issued various messages, but the position taken by the Soviet Union is not so clear. People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, has been talking with British Ambassador Sir Seeds for several days. The Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, returned from London yesterday, bringing various intelligence for Litvinov's reference. The Soviet attitude may therefore be determined. (20th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Diplomatic figures here recently declared that the constructive talks between Britain and the Soviet Union on the organization of a collective security system have progressed very well. The United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and other related countries all have hope of reaching a compromise. (21st Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources here, regardless of whether Poland and Romania are willing to accept Soviet military assistance in the event of aggression, the United Kingdom and France have decided to conclude a trilateral military agreement with the Soviet Union. Although this military agreement is still under negotiation, it is largely complete. The reason for continuing negotiations is nothing more than to explore the reasons for the opposition of the Baltic countries and to bring the two countries into the trilateral military agreement. Assuming that the Baltic countries firmly refuse to join, the Anglo-French-Soviet military agreement will be concluded. At the same time, the methods of how the three countries will cooperate militarily in the event of an emergency will be determined at a military conference to be held soon. As for the rumors that the United Kingdom and France will guarantee the borders of the Soviet Union's Far East, this is considered unfounded here, and it is said that this issue should be spoken on by the United States.

<p>(London) The British government still hopes to reconcile with Italy. Last night, the speech of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Campo Doglio, the capital of the ancient Roman Empire, began to be studied in detail. The first reaction of officials here to Mussolini's speech is that although the speech expressed opposition to President Roosevelt's peace proposals and Britain's encirclement policy, its content was not enough to increase the severity of the European situation. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's declaration that the Rome-Berlin axis policy is a peace policy is completely contradictory to Italy's activities in Abyssinia, Spain, and Albania.

<h3>World's Largest Anti-Aircraft Gun Discovered in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, when Germany held a military parade to celebrate Hitler's birthday, military attachés from various countries paid close attention to what they saw as the world's largest anti-aircraft gun. The gun is divided into three sections, carried by trucks, with a caliber of 15 centimeters, not the 8 centimeters that Germany has always used. (20th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Did Not Congratulate Hitler on His Birthday</h3>
<p>(New York) According to news from Washington, people from all walks of life are paying close attention to the fact that President Roosevelt did not send a telegram to Hitler to congratulate him on his birthday, as King George of England did. According to reports, the State Department issued the following statement on the matter: "According to custom, the President of the United States congratulates foreign heads of state only on their national day." (21st Haitong)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently made a speech, saying that he has obtained the necessary powers to take various measures to control the foreign exchange market when the international situation requires it. Informed sources recently commented that if the European situation is extremely tense, the financial authorities may order the foreign exchange market to temporarily close, and it is not impossible to control exchange rates after the resumption of business.

<h3>Germany Actively Attracting Various Countries Diplomatically; And Seeking Opinions from Various Small Countries to Lay the Groundwork for Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, on the occasion of the 50th birthday of Head of State Hitler, many governments sent representatives to offer their congratulations. The German government was able to take this opportunity to conduct large-scale diplomatic activities. Officials were full of confidence, saying that if various countries had doubts about our country's intentions, they would not automatically send representatives to offer their congratulations. In particular, the impending visit of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovic and Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki proves the strong attraction of the Rome-Berlin axis to the countries of the Danube region. In addition, authorities from other countries will also come to Germany in a short period of time, so the German government has more opportunities to shift the views of the countries in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula, not only to prevent them from cooperating with various democratic countries, but also to establish joint relations with Germany in economic and political terms. When Head of State Hitler delivers a speech in the House of Representatives on the 28th of this month, he will definitely use the fact that authorities from various countries have come to visit one after another and are willing to establish friendly relations with Germany as a way to answer US President Roosevelt. In addition, it is generally believed that the government has already conducted probes through diplomatic channels to the governments of the various small countries listed in President Roosevelt's telegram, hoping that the various small countries will directly announce that they have not been threatened by Germany. (21st Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) US President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram to the authorities of Germany and Italy, asking them to provide guarantees that they will not invade other countries in Europe for several years. It is recently learned that the German government has already ordered its envoys stationed in various small countries in Europe to raise two questions to the diplomatic authorities of these countries: (1) Does each country believe that its independence has been threatened by Germany? (2) Have they requested President Roosevelt to intervene? The authorities of the various countries are inconvenienced to give an affirmative answer due to considerations of face. If this is the case, then Head of State Hitler can declare in the German House of Representatives on the 28th of this month that these countries have not been threatened, in order to refute President Roosevelt's appeal. (20th Havas)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia Informed sources here recently declared that Foreign Minister Markovic will fly to Berlin on the 25th of this month to conduct talks with the German authorities and is scheduled to return home on the 27th. (21st Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is heard that the German government will propose to the Romanian government that it is willing to guarantee the country's security for a period of thirty years in order to develop economic relations, but this has not yet been confirmed. Observers here all say that Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu was very satisfied with the talks with the German government authorities. The attitude of the various democratic countries is firm, but in fact, it is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. None of the countries on the European continent are willing to fight for Britain. Germany should still conduct a "peaceful" struggle in order to obtain the space essential for its survival. (20th Havas)</p>
<h3>Italy Cozying Up to Hungary and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>(Rome) Informed sources here recently declared that Italy is currently working hard to establish close cooperative relations with Yugoslavia and Hungary. Whether it can succeed depends on whether Yugoslavia and Hungary can reconcile. Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go to the port of Venice tomorrow to conduct talks with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovic to persuade the country to join hands with Hungary. Hungary has agreed to abandon its territorial claims against Yugoslavia after Italy's persuasion. Therefore, the estrangement between Yugoslavia and Hungary has disappeared, and if Italy obtains close cooperation between Yugoslavia and Hungary, then its plan to organize an alliance in the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula (including Bulgaria) will be easier to realize. In addition, it is also heard that Foreign Minister Ciano and Foreign Minister Markovic will also discuss the two issues of Yugoslavia joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and withdrawing from the League of Nations. In a word, Foreign Minister Ciano is currently doing his best to persuade Yugoslavia to join the German-Italian group. If this can be done, then the "Danube Alliance" under Italian leadership will not only have a great impact on Turkey, Greece, and Romania, but also fundamentally disintegrate the Balkan Entente.

<h3>Bulgaria Raises Demands, Bulgarian Prime Minister Denies</h3>
<p>(London) According to today's "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Sofia, Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov told the parliament that the Bulgarian government has made a request to restore the Bulgarian borders before the 1913 Balkan Wars and World War I. The territorial claims include (1) southern Dobruja in Romania, with an area of 3,000 square miles, (2) eastern Greece, with an area of 3,250 square miles. If this area is returned to Bulgaria, Bulgaria will have access to the Aegean Sea, (3) western Yugoslavia and the Strumica region, with an area of 1,000 square miles. Also, the "Daily Mail" reporter has the same report, claiming that Bulgaria has notified Romania and Greece to return the land ceded to the two countries after the war, namely Dobruja in Romania and eastern Greece. (21st Associated Press)</p>
<p>Capital of Bulgaria After Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov explained foreign policy to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives yesterday, it was rumored that the government had made territorial demands on Romania (according to the Romanian province of Dobruja, which originally belonged to Bulgaria before the European War). Informed sources here recently denied that there was no such thing. (21st Havas)</p>
<h3>World War II Can Still Be Avoided, The US is Observing</h3>
<p>Minneapolis, USA According to Secretary of State Hull's secretary, Edmund, last night, the United States' hope of saving World War II has not yet disappeared, and said that the reason why President Roosevelt did not hesitate to send telegrams of peace appeals to Hitler and Mussolini was that he "firmly believed that it was not too late to save the situation and return to peace," and at the same time firmly believed that international economic relations should be established on a "sound and permanent basis."

<h3>Roosevelt Summoned Lindbergh</h3>
<p>(Washington) Colonel Lindbergh, a famous aviator, was summoned by President Roosevelt yesterday after returning from Europe, and had a long talk with him. He then attended the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (composed of experts from the Army, Navy Air Corps, and various civil aviation companies) and reported on it. Afterwards, according to responsible sources, Colonel Lindbergh suggested to the committee that the United States must develop aviation technically with all its strength in order to compete with other countries. The main point is to step up scientific research and improve the quality of various types of aircraft, both military and civilian, without rushing to increase the quantity. He is scheduled to visit various research institutions and aircraft factories in the coming days. (20th Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Colonel Lindbergh met with President Roosevelt yesterday for half an hour, mainly to report on his investigation of the strength of the air forces of various countries. According to Lindbergh's statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the production of aircraft depends on the superiority of quality. He advocated developing the aircraft industry in various South American countries to enhance defense capabilities. (21st Associated Press)</p>
<h3>The UK is Strengthening National Defense, Progress is Rapid</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters correspondent in Parliament said that the UK's national defense movement is progressing very rapidly. The War Office today adopted two measures to improve the army: (1) changing the overseas service period from six years to four years, (2) giving reservists the opportunity to rejoin the ranks. Soldiers in their last year of active service can now continue to serve for twenty-one years and receive a pension upon completion. At the same time, various industries in the UK are cooperating with the government to actively prepare for contingencies. Imperial Chemical Industries, which employs the most people, second only to railway companies, has now decided to provide subsidies to its 63,000 workers who join the army in wartime. This week, it has begun to recruit 100,000 young nurses to serve in hospital auxiliary teams in emergencies. The government has also issued a circular to local authorities, making civil national defense the top priority in the next three months. 60,000 steel air-raid shelters are distributed to each place every week. It is estimated that 2 million homeowners will be provided with this air-raid shelter free of charge by the government. (20th Reuters)</p>

<h3>The Saodang Bao Refutes Wang Jingwei's Fallacies; The Army's Offense and Defense Are Irreproachable; Comparing the Present to the Past is Also Absurd</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Saodang Bao published a statement issued by the Political Department of the Military Commission in a prominent position this morning, refuting Wang Jingwei's article disclosed in the Nanhua Daily, which criticized the actions of Chinese generals in the battle and harbored doubts about the results of the war. It stated that the Chinese army's offensive or defensive posture is determined by strategic needs and is irreproachable. Comparing the Song and Ming Dynasties to modern times is also absurd. It should be known that the conquest of the Song and Ming Dynasties by foreign races was due to the indecision of those in power and the efforts of traitors to seek peace. (21st Reuters)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Trade Associations Express Hatred for Wang</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Shanghai City (115) Trade Associations jointly submitted a telegram to the Central Executive Committee, Chairman Lin of the National Government, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, expressing their indignation and hatred at the rumors that Wang Jingwei and his party were secretly preparing to go to Shanghai to participate in the Nanjing puppet organization. The original text is as follows, titles omitted: Wang Jingwei, as a person who bears the important responsibilities of the party and the country, actually advocated peace talks that would lead to the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race at a time when the anti-Japanese situation has improved. Even a three-foot-tall child knows that this is absurd. Reading in the newspaper about the telegram of peace advocated by him last December, the words and lines are purely for the benefit of Japan and are truly unforgivable. The merchants of Shanghai have long had a firm belief in the established national policy of the inevitable victory of the anti-Japanese war and the inevitable success of national construction, and will never be tempted by his heresies. Because of the rumors that he and his accomplices are secretly preparing to come to Shanghai to participate in the Nanjing puppet organization, the merchants of Shanghai are all filled with hatred and hate. We hereby jointly send a telegram to express our intention. Respectfully request your wise judgment, Shanghai Xiyanliao Industry Trade Association, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Association, Shanghai Department Store Industry Trade Association, etc. (25) Industry Trade Associations bowing.</p>
<h3>Wang is a Shameless Villain Who Was Abandoned by the People Long Ago</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Political Department of the Military Commission issued a declaration, comparing Wang Jingwei to the treacherous officials of the late Song and Ming Dynasties. It said that Wang Jingwei is truly a "shameless" villain. He cited historical examples, but who is he? He is the same as the treacherous officials of the Song and Ming Dynasties, or even worse than these treacherous officials. The Ming Dynasty was destroyed by Boyan. Notes: So-and-so is Wang Jingwei's ancestor, so the saying that the ancestor must have his descendant is indeed true. Wang Jingwei mocked the Chinese military's strategy. He was happy when he heard of the Chinese army's failure, and he was downcast when he heard of the Chinese army's victory. He is a heartless person. He has disclosed many military secrets in his article. He has betrayed the country and the people. Wang wants to see the complete failure of the anti-Japanese war and the annihilation of the entire Chinese army, so that he can negotiate peace and submit to the enemy. Shouldn't he be killed for this? At the same time, the "Saodang Bao" reported that Wang Jingwei's accomplices in Shanghai intended to take over the Huadong Printing House in order to publish the so-called "Far East Daily," and also intended to found a certain evening newspaper and organize a Republican Publishing House to promote Wang.</p>
<h3>US VIPs Attack Silver Purchase Policy; Advocate Reducing by 10%</h3>
<p>(Washington) Federal Reserve Board Chairman Eccles also joined the attack on the silver purchase policy when presenting his views to the Senate Banking and Business Committee today, opposing the Treasury Department's continued purchase of silver, but said that stopping the purchase of silver would cause a serious situation in the silver market, so he advocated that before Congress decides on the measures to be taken for domestically produced silver, only foreign silver should be stopped from being purchased. Proposed a new policy to reduce government purchases by 10% compared to existing and previous purchases. According to this plan, imported silver is prohibited, and the country purchases domestically produced silver that has not been absorbed by domestic commerce at a price of about 50 cents per ounce.

<h3>Submarine Discovered off the Coast of Canada</h3>
<p>Ottawa Defense Minister McGowan recently said that a mysterious submarine was heard to have been discovered off the coast of Nova Scotia. Patrols are currently searching and vigilance is extremely tight. According to news from Nova Scotia, the naval commander has ordered that the entrance ships that passed by the Halifax pilot boat after midnight on April 18 and 19 must communicate with the naval authorities. This time, the discovery of a mysterious submarine off the coast of Canada is reminiscent of the amazing events in the Atlantic in February, when a "mystery ship" sent out a distress signal, saying that the ship was torpedoed by an unidentified submarine 200 miles south of the Azores. The name of the ship that was attacked is still a mystery. Some believe that there is a possibility of joking, but this matter has caused great fear, and Europe and the United States have widely inquired. At that time, the British ship Queen of Australia and the Greek ship Monte Sgrelon were searching in the Atlantic Ocean in the area where the unnamed ship sent out the distress signal, but did not find the ship. (20th Reuters)</p>
<p>Ottawa A submarine of unknown nationality was discovered in the sea off Halifax, Canada yesterday. According to military sources, the coastal defense authorities are sure that this submarine does not belong to the United Kingdom or the United States, and there is no doubt that it came to spy on Canada's coastal defenses. Although Defense Minister Mackenzie declared in the House of Representatives today that the authorities have sent destroyers and reconnaissance planes to patrol near the port and have not found any traces of submarines, many members of Congress are still uneasy. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of National Defense has not only stepped up coastal defense, but also ordered the authorities of Ontario to strictly guard against power plants and other important factories.

<h3>German Goods Rushing to the US</h3>
<p>(Washington) The government authorities previously announced that, starting from the 22nd of this month, all goods imported from Germany must pay an additional tax of 25%. With the deadline approaching, German ships are rushing to load goods and come here. The "Hamburg America Line" claims that the company's ships have already sailed to various ports on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and there are as many as eleven ships that will arrive here soon, some of which originally belonged to the Pacific route and were specially transferred to the Atlantic line so that they can load goods and transport them to the United States before the 22nd of this month.

<h3>Polish Declaration: Determined to Protect Danzig</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish government has issued a statement asserting that any country attempting to undermine the current legal status of the Free City of Danzig will be considered an act of aggression and met with military resistance. They have also expressed opposition to Germany's construction of an autobahn through the Polish Corridor, demonstrating a firm stance. The situation concerning the Free City of Danzig has undergone a change due to three factors: (1) The Nazi Party members in the city have little hope of a successful uprising, as their strength pales in comparison to the forces Poland can mobilize, and the Polish government has decided to impose a military blockade. (2) Any German military action against the city risks triggering a major war, necessitating extreme caution. (3) Once the League of Nations Council convenes to discuss the Danzig issue, the position of High Commissioner to the city will likely be abolished. If this happens, Germany and Poland will have room for direct discussions on a compromise. There is no need to rush matters now. Some suggest that the Free City of Danzig should be reorganized as an independent state controlled by the Nazi Party, while Poland retains free control over the port and other economic interests. This approach might be possible, but observers here generally believe that neither Germany nor Poland is currently inclined to begin negotiations or consider concessions. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Floodwaters Recede in Northern Jiangsu, Spring Returns to the Land, People Recovering. Both Che and Xin Dams at Gaoyou Have Been Re-closed; Upstream Water Sources Blocked, Downstream Dredging Continues.</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: Last year, the area south of the Huai River in northern Jiangsu was affected by the breach of the Yellow River, causing flooding in eight or nine counties. The disaster was severe, affecting no fewer than 200,000 people. The area flooded spanned over two thousand square li, a vast expanse resembling a lake. Officials and gentry in Jiangsu repeatedly appealed for aid, and the Central Government approved funding to reinforce the dams and dredge the waterways to the sea for drainage. Despite the tense military situation, the Provincial Government actively pursued these projects. The breaches at Che and Xin Dams on the Gaoyou Canal have now been closed, and both sides of the levee are being reinforced. The upstream floodwaters have been stemmed, and the dredging of the downstream waterways is progressing rapidly. Since last week, the floodwaters in northern Jiangsu have receded significantly, with the land drying up by more than two chi. Farmers are busy with spring plowing. A high-ranking officer, amidst a busy schedule, took time to inspect the water diversion and levee restoration projects, travelling from a certain place to Gaoyou. Along the way, the rivers crisscrossed the landscape, and patches of dry land appeared like scattered stars. The green willows lined the banks, the red peach blossoms were half open, and the vegetable fields were yellow with rapeseed flowers. The wheat seedlings were green. The scene was like another world compared to the vast expanse of waves that had been visible two weeks ago. The officer arrived in Gaoyou, listened to reports from military and government personnel on the general situation, and then personally inspected the levee restoration projects at Che and Xin Dams. Last year, the levee at this point was breached by the Yellow River, causing hundreds of zhang to collapse. The surging waters flowed eastward, as if ten thousand horses were galloping. The lands of the counties south of the Huai River were submerged, all due to the waters directed from these two sources. Now, the gap has been closed, and the waves have calmed. The officer commended the engineers and laborers, urging them to complete the levee restoration soon. He left Gaoyou that evening for other destinations. The county is only forty li away from the front line at Lujin Zhaoguan. The Chinese army bravely defends the area, and the Japanese and puppet forces have not succeeded in attacking, so the people of Gaoyou can live in peace. Now, the military situation in northern Jiangsu has stabilized, and the flooding will be alleviated. Spring has returned to the land, and the people have hope for recovery.</p>
<h3>Administrative Conference in Western Zhejiang: Divided into Six Groups for Discussion</h3>
<p>Xiaofeng Correspondence: The Western Zhejiang Administrative Conference was held recently in a mountain area at ××××. Attendees included: Wang Hao, Administrative Commissioner of the First District; Qiu Yulin, Administrative Commissioner of the Second District; Yang Lingchao and Yuan Xun, Deputy Commanders of the Second District; Meng Zhi and Zhu Xi, Commanders of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Corps of the Second District; Chen Li, Secretary of the Western Zhejiang Tax Office; Yang Wenzhao, Chief of the War Zone Material Transportation Office; as well as county magistrates and party secretaries from various counties. Huang Shaobi presided over the meeting. Following the opening session, the conference divided into six groups to discuss war zone civil administration, finance, construction, military affairs, mass organization, and cultural education. Magistrates from guerrilla-affected counties all presented reports. It was agreed that the undesirable activities of bandit-style guerrilla units should be eliminated to increase the strength of the resistance and stabilize the livelihood of the people in the war zone. At the same time, efforts should be made to collect all materials within the war zone to prevent them from benefiting the enemy. It was also resolved to organize a joint Party-Government War Zone Office.</p>
<h3>Large Youth Organization in Xinghua, Hosted by Political Training Organs</h3>

<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Over two hundred refugees from Cixi and Yuyao counties have recently moved to the Huatang area of Sanmen Bay in eastern Zhejiang to reclaim land. They plan to plant American cotton on the reclaimed land to increase wartime production. They are currently building thatched huts and dredging ditches.</p>

<h3>Invading Japanese Troops in Xinhui Advance Along the Ningyang Railway Line, Chinese Troops Firmly Defend Key Points, Intense Resistance, Cannon Fire Unceasing Near Guangzhou, Japanese Eastern River Front Lines Have Already Wavered</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese troops invading Jiangmen and Xinhui in Guangdong have been reinforced for days, Guangzhou troops were emptied. On the 10th of this month, over a thousand Japanese cavalrymen took the route through Jiujiang and headed towards Tangxia in Xinhui, hoping to prevent the Chinese army from launching a counterattack south from Heshan. As a result, Tangxia has become a key point of contention between the two armies. The Chinese army is advancing steadily along the Jiangmen-Foshan road, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army five or six times. The fighting continued until the 13th, with the result of the tug-of-war being more than a thousand casualties on both sides. To the south of Tangxia, in the Huangzhuang and Yugang areas, the Japanese army is still on the defensive and has successively dispatched reinforcements three times. The ones coming from Jiujiang to Zhutoushan to aid Tangxia are the Gushantani unit and cavalry. The Murakami unit, the Kanamaru battalion, and the Tanakada platoon, no less than two thousand men, are all part of the regular Japanese army, stationed in Beijie Jiangmen. As for the puppet army and mercenary troops, they have all been driven to the front line of Xinhui, attempting to invade the Four Counties. On the 13th, they invaded along the Ningyang Railway, using cavalry to charge, and under the firepower of more than ten steel cannons, they fiercely attacked the Daze area. The brave soldiers of Guangdong and Guangxi tightly guarded the Sishui River Village and the Tanjiang Bridge in various places and resisted strongly. The Japanese army seemed to be trying to break through from this route into Danshuikou and disturb Kaiping. On the 12th, more than ten Japanese planes bombed Danshuikou, and the people fled to Kaiping Xinchang and Digai to take refuge. The Chinese main force, to defend the Kaiping and Taishan county borders, has been sent to the Xinhui and Kaiping border areas to set up defenses. If the Japanese army arrives, they will be severely attacked. In addition, Japanese warships on the sea have sent teams to harass Taishan Guanghai twice. On the 11th, more than a hundred Japanese marines tried to land in Haiyan. The Japanese warships fired hundreds of shells to cover the advance of the infantry. The local defense force waited for the Japanese army to advance to a suitable location, and then launched an intense barrage of fire. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, with thousands killed and wounded, and fled in a panic back to the warships. This Japanese route seems to be a probing action. The situation in Guanghai has become slightly milder, and the focus of the war is still in Tangxia, Daze, and Siqian in Xinhui.</p>
<p>Crushing Defeat for Japanese Army in Conghua</p>
<p>In terms of the overall war situation, although the Xinhui and Kaiping border areas are still in a stalemate, after the Chinese army in the North River recovered Conghua, and annihilated the regular Japanese army Abe, Koga, and the 17th and 18th Regiments on both sides of the Conghua River, the northern barrier of the Guangzhou Japanese army has been removed. According to refugees from Guangzhou on the 13th, after the Japanese army suffered a crushing defeat in Conghua, the Chinese army advanced to Xin Street and once rushed into Jiangcun. The sound of artillery fire in the northwest suburbs of Guangzhou was unceasing all day. At night, a curfew was imposed in the city, and the Japanese army and military supplies were transported to the North River to respond, and were extremely busy. If the Japanese army in the North River loses again at Jiangcun, then the Chinese army may soon approach the outskirts of Guangzhou. Most of the citizens worried about street fighting and fled the urban area. Therefore, a total of 1,200 people from Guangzhou took the Foshan ferry to Hong Kong. The Japanese military police in Guangzhou have recently been ending their patrols earlier every evening. River traffic has also been completely cut off, and robbery cases continue to occur. The sounds of citizens shouting for thieves and help at night mixed with the sound of gongs and drums, but the so-called self-defense team huddled in a corner, turning a deaf ear, so the city's public security is still unable to be maintained.</p>
<p>Chinese Army Raids Shitan</p>
<p>On the East River front, guerrilla warfare occurred near Dongguan, so foreigners mistakenly reported that Shilong, Dongguan, had been recaptured by the Chinese army. In fact, the center of gravity of the eastern route battle is still in Zengcheng. A month ago, the Japanese army in Zengcheng invaded the Longmen area. Recently, the Chinese army on the eastern front launched a counterattack on Zengcheng in several routes. On the afternoon of the 11th, it finally captured the bell and drum ridge, mosquito ridge, and Qiaotou strongholds near Zengcheng. The Japanese army rushed to support from Zhucun and other places, but failed. The Chinese guerrillas gathered various troops and raided Shitan. The Japanese army feared that if Shitan was lost, the outer defense line of the Guangzhou Japanese army would be shaken, and they forced engineers to build fortifications in the Longyandong suburbs day and night, trying to resist to the end, and the situation was very embarrassing.</p>

The above is the truth about the evacuation in various parts of Chaoshan. At present, due to the increasingly urgent war situation, people and materials have been moving towards the upper reaches of the Han River, filling the land and water with mountains of people, all ordered to evacuate.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Western Zhejiang Starts Counter-Offensive, Fierce Fighting Occurs on Various Lines for Days</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese army ×× and other divisions in western Zhejiang were ordered to start a counter-offensive, fierce battles have occurred on various lines for days. The war reports from various places are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>The Japanese troops near Yanmu Town, which belongs to Jiaxing County and borders Jiangsu, were besieged by a Chinese army guerrilla unit some time ago. The fighting was fierce. Later, the Japanese side used sulfur guns to fire at the civilian houses in the Chinese army's strongholds in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese army's morale. However, the morale of the Chinese army was very high. Therefore, although the fire in the rear was very fierce, they continued to charge and kill. As a result, the Japanese army collapsed.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>The Chinese army Huyang浜, near Nanxun Town, Huzhou County, was about to set off to attack Nanxun when it was detected by a traitor. The Japanese army immediately sent a large team to attack. The Chinese side responded fiercely with small cannons, and finally annihilated the Japanese soldiers. On the evening of the 15th, the Chinese army in Wuzhen attacked the Japanese army headquarters west of Nanxingqiao River from the northwest fence and captured a lot. The Chinese army at ×× place near the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway captured Sanqiaobu on the 14th and continued to press towards Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Tongxiang</p>
<p>The Tongxiang County Self-Defense Regiment was ordered to attack Yicheng some time ago, and immediately came into contact with the Japanese army in the suburbs. Then, because the Chinese side's mission was over, it retreated to its original position. Since then, the Japanese army in the city has dared not stay in the camp every night. Shen Mingcai, the magistrate of Chongde County, once led his troops to capture Xinshi on the 13th, and once attacked Yicheng.</p>
<p>Haiyan</p>
<p>The Chinese army ×× Division in Haiyan attacked the coastal strongholds of Yu City and Ganpu some time ago, and the fighting was fierce. They also destroyed some of the Japanese army's coastal works. Then, the Chinese army retreated after the purpose was achieved. The Chinese army in Haining is now getting help from ×× Division and is actively attacking Yicheng.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, the Chinese army is extremely active. Gunshots are heard in the city from time to time. There was once a rumor in the city that the army had captured Songmucha and other places in the suburbs. There was also a Chinese army attack on the Jianqiao Japanese airfield, and a section of the railway was pried off. It was repaired by the Japanese side the next morning.</p>
<h3>Pirates Harass the Waters of Yule, Gang Members Protected by Certain Parties, Japanese Planes Scatter Leaflets in Wenling</h3>
<p>Yuhuan Correspondence: The Japanese warships anchored in the waters of Damenshan and Xiaomenshan, which border this county and Yueqing, have now sailed away. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of this month, two hundred and one hundred pirates were found on the sea, fully armed, robbing passing merchant ships. As a result, the cargo ships of Yongjia, which travel from Wenling Jiangxia Port, a port under the jurisdiction of the entire district, have all stopped running. As a result, the export of local products from the Taiwan district cannot be transported to other places, and the price has also fallen sharply. The gang of bandits originally perched on Dachen Mountain and Langqi Mountain in Wenling County. Recently, Zhang Xiaosong, the deputy commander of the county, personally led the team to encircle and suppress them. They fled upon hearing the news and harassed the waters. It is also heard that the gang of bandits are protected by certain parties and are divided into Damenshan, Pishan, and other places. The authorities will send teams to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>In addition, in the airspace along the coast of this county and the neighboring county of Wenling, Japanese planes have been flying to scatter absurd leaflets of red and green paper in recent days.</p>

<h3>United States Modifies Neutrality Act, Shanghai Public Organizations Ask to Maintain Justice, Telegraph to US Senate and House Foreign Relations Committees, Clarify Position and Request a New Bill</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various important public organizations in this city telegraphed the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses of the US Congress regarding the US amendment to the Neutrality Act, expressing our country's position and requesting that justice be upheld. The telegram is as follows: To the Honorable Members of the Foreign Relations Committees of the US Senate and House of Representatives in Washington: News reports indicate that the proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act by your committees not only fails to distinguish between aggressor and victim but also expands the "cash and carry" provisions, which clearly benefit Japan and harm China. The news has deeply alarmed our organizations. We respectfully request that you carefully consider and expedite the enactment of measures to prohibit the export of all war materials, including oil, iron, cotton, etc., to Japan. This will enhance the century-old friendship between China and the United States and end the Japanese massacre of civilians, women, and children. It will also help restore the rule of law and world justice in the Far East. We fervently hope for this outcome. Another telegram was sent to Pittman, saying: To the Honorable Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committees of the US Senate and House of Representatives in Washington: Having read the news, we are delighted to learn that you have recommended to your committees the enactment of a new law to stop Japanese aggression. Our organizations extend our congratulations and respect. We hope you will continue your efforts to lead US public opinion in adopting effective measures to uphold international justice and re-establish peace.</p>
<h3>The Press of This City Publishes a Declaration Denouncing Traitors, Calls on Citizens to Block the Activities of the Wang Clique and Rebel Party</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Mental Mobilization Cultural Promotion Day in this city. The members of the press in this city specially issued a joint declaration, denouncing the fallacies and reckless actions of the traitors, and calling on all citizens to block all avenues of activity for Wang Jingwei and his faction. The full text of the declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>As the national war of resistance enters its second phase, Japanese imperialism has realized that its dream of conquering China by force cannot be realized. Therefore, it emphasizes the activities of traitors, on the one hand, attempting to split China's anti-Japanese ranks, and on the other hand, to cover up its new offensive and seek to relax China's vigilance. Among these traitorous activities, especially the treasonous activities of Jingwei and his faction, the dissemination of national failure emotions in the form of "peace" and "direct negotiations" has been very poisonous. The traitor's "peace" proposition, echoing the smoke of the New Order in East Asia, although he can justify it himself, is actually a thorough condition for national subjugation. As President Chiang said, "If this is considered peace, then there is no word 'surrender' in the dictionary." Today is the Propaganda Week of National Mental Mobilization, the Culture Promotion Day. We solemnly declare that we will do our best to oppose the activities of aggressors and traitors. We will resolutely strike back against the activities of aggressors and all traitors in the rebel party. We call on all citizens to unite to oppose the ghostly activities of all traitors in the rebel party and block the path of any activities of the rebel party and all traitors.</p>

<h3>Interference with Flag Hanging Case: Quietly Awaiting External Negotiations; French Concession Shops Fully Reopened Yesterday; Chinese Ratepayers Association Letter to French Consul for Return of National Flag</h3>
<p>The French Concession's interference with the flag-hanging incident, the closed businesses, all reopened yesterday. The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the French Consul-General requesting the return of the national flags. Various public organizations have telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Ambassador, awaiting a reasonable resolution. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shops Fully Reopened Yesterday</p>
<p>Various businesses in the French Concession, spurred by patriotic fervor due to interference with flag-hanging, voluntarily closed. After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association made strenuous efforts to persuade them to avoid escalation, they all reopened yesterday. Most of the citizens arrested this time were shop employees. According to an investigation by the Xin Sheng News Agency, a total of forty-three people were arrested, including Yang Ke Dong and others, some of whom sustained minor injuries. After being released the day before yesterday afternoon, they went to hospitals for treatment. However, the French police still maintained a state of alert yesterday, dispatching armored vehicles and detectives to patrol closely, but it was not as tense as the day before.</p>
<p>Letter to the French Consul-General for Return of National Flag</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, based on the agreement reached by the three representatives, Qu Zhenhua, Dai Chunfeng, and Gong Jingyan, with the French Police Commissioner, sent a letter to the French Consul-General at 1:00 PM yesterday, requesting the return of the confiscated national flags. However, as of the time of this reporter's dispatch, they had not yet been returned. According to reliable sources, this was due to procedural delays and not a change of heart. The original letter from the association to the French Consul-General stated: "Regarding the flag-hanging incident, this association appointed Qu Zhenhua, Jingyan, and Dai Chunfeng as committee members to discuss solutions with the French Concession Police Commissioner. The Commissioner agreed to have all confiscated national flags returned upon a letter from this association, for distribution. In addition to notifying all shops, we respectfully request Your Excellency the Consul-General to swiftly instruct the Lu Jia Zui Police Station to return the national flags so that they can be transferred to the shops."</p>
<p>Various Public Organizations Request External Negotiations</p>
<p>Various public organizations in this city believe that the national flag represents the dignity of the nation, and citizens have the freedom to hang the national flag. The repeated interference in the French Concession is detrimental to friendly relations between the countries. They have jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Ambassador for rectification, in order to promote harmony. Therefore, all sectors are awaiting a reasonable resolution. Furthermore, the license for the Golden Grand Theater was returned yesterday afternoon, and the theater is scheduled to resume normal business day and night today.</p>
<h3>Swiss Consul Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General to China, von Planta, returned to Shanghai from North China yesterday (the 20th).</p>
<p>British Warship Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The "China Mail" reports that the British warship HMS "Taurus" arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 20th) and berthed at the British naval pontoon.</p>
<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization: Today is the Day of Propaganda for Professional Circles; Listing Seven Key Points to Mutually Supervise and Encourage, Concentrating Willpower and Collective Efforts</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the day of propaganda for the cultural sector during the National Spiritual Mobilization Propaganda Week. In addition to issuing declarations, various newspapers also published special supplements. The press also issued a declaration denouncing traitors, calling on citizens to block the movements of the Wang Jingwei regime. Today is the day of propaganda for professional circles. The Shanghai Professional Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association has issued an inaugural declaration, and various newspapers have published special supplements. The following is a verbatim transcription: "Our country's war of resistance has entered a new and more arduous stage. In this stage, as the supreme leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has declared, 'To defeat the enemy and build the country successfully, we must rely heavily on unleashing the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, arduous, and dangerous our environment will inevitably become, and the more we must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to achieve final success.' Therefore, at this critical juncture of survival, we must mobilize all the strength of the entire nation to overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and strive for the final victory of the Chinese nation's freedom and liberation. On March 12th, the central government promulgated the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline and Implementation Measures, which are the most effective weapons to mobilize the strength of the entire nation to strike at the enemy's attacks. The people of the whole country, under the leadership of the government and the supreme leader, are actively promoting it. The Shanghai Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association headquarters was established last month, and our professional circles headquarters is following suit today. In Shanghai, national spiritual mobilization has its own special significance, and the tasks undertaken by professional circles are particularly important. Shanghai is a political and economic center, and the aggressors' political conspiracies and economic plunder are particularly severe. The activities of traitors are extremely rampant. In the past, a class of traitors based in Hong Kong and other places has recently gradually moved to Shanghai to serve as their main base, spreading rumors of peace, carrying out divisive conspiracies, and attempting to buy off some corrupt elements in the cultural and business circles to serve as their pawns. Economically, the enemy is issuing counterfeit currency, disrupting our financial foundation, controlling industry and commerce, strangling our national industries, and dumping inferior goods to absorb our funds. These are all actions taken by the enemy in preparation for their final struggle and new attacks. Therefore, our professional circles must not only cooperate with all sectors of Shanghai to respond to the great call of the supreme leader's national spiritual mobilization, but also implement it more practically and resolutely fulfill the important tasks entrusted to us by the government. However, in order to make this movement thorough and truly innovative, we advocate that people in professional circles and professional organizations, based on the specific circumstances and environment of their respective industries, take the following points as the center and mobilize the entire professional circles, regardless of superiors or subordinates: (1) Launch an anti-traitor movement, enhance political awareness, eliminate all wavering and compromising thoughts, and strictly prevent the actions of all corrupt elements, in order to extinguish the traitorous activities of Wang Jingwei and his pawns and strengthen our anti-Japanese front. (2) Persist in not cooperating with the enemy and puppet regimes. Financial circles should not use counterfeit currency or engage in economic dealings with the enemy and puppets. Industrial circles should not sell raw materials to the enemy and puppets or jointly run enterprises with them. Commercial circles should not buy or sell Japanese goods and should oppose all control by the enemy and puppets, so that the enemy cannot extract our money or use it. (3) Mobilize funds, machinery, and talent to the interior to build the rear area and consolidate the economic wall. (4) Eliminate bad habits, ban speculation, correct the life of indulgence, cultivate a spirit of striving and vigor, break the selfish pursuit of profit, ban illegal businesses, and suppress profiteering and speculation during the national crisis. (5) Participate in collective life. All people in professional circles who do not participate in the Chamber of Commerce National Spiritual Mobilization Association should participate in the branch organizations of this association in various industries. Companies and shops should be led by managers to ensure that everyone can actively participate in collective life automatically. (6) Practice thrift and donate money, quit bad habits, prohibit luxury and extravagance, and reduce the standard of living, so that the money saved can be used to help refugees and donate to the country. Encourage those with assets to sacrifice their families to relieve the national crisis, and earnestly promote various movements to contribute to the country in spirit or material. (7) Concentrate efforts and intensify labor-capital unity. General workers should strive to improve production in their positions, while capital should also take into account the wartime life of workers and make appropriate improvements. The outline states, 'Although the promotion of spiritual mobilization originates from top to bottom, in order to achieve true and unadulterated results, it must rely on mutual supervision and encouragement. In families, family members and siblings should warn and encourage each other. In institutions and organizations, all members should work together and learn from each other. In society, regardless of status, those with similar identities should supervise and encourage each other as comrades and compatriots. Even for those with higher status, if there are thoughts, speeches, or actions that violate the spirit, they should earnestly persuade them to reform based on the standpoint of the country and the nation.' Therefore, general mobilization is a democratic movement from top to bottom and from bottom to top. We must intensify the unity of labor and capital in order to achieve 'concentration of will and concentration of strength' and unleash collective strength. We believe that if we can grasp the above points and cooperate with each other, spiritual mobilization will definitely be greatly expanded in professional circles. We will use this to encourage and compete with people from all walks of life. Recently, the war situation has turned in our favor day by day, and the dawn of victory has already emerged. But we cannot forget Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration, 'The closer we get to victory, the more difficult, arduous, and dangerous our environment will inevitably become, and we must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to achieve final success.' Let us shoulder this important task, expand spiritual mobilization, turn it into a widespread and in-depth mass movement, mobilize all the spiritual strength of the entire nation, complete the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction, and realize the new China of the Three Principles of the People: national independence, civil rights, and people's livelihood. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3>Buses and Inland River Vessels: Puppet Regime Forcibly Imposes Control, Sets Harsh Examples, Arbitrarily Exploits Transportation Industry; Trade Groups Discuss Resistance</h3>
<p>Regarding inland war zones, after the Japanese side used its special violence to control shipping in various ports, it has recently forcibly imposed control over land and water transportation tools, arbitrarily exploiting the interests of the people. According to a report by a reporter from the "Modern Society," the Japanese puppet regime (1) will bring inland river vessels under the jurisdiction of inland river shipping companies, levying various fees based on the tonnage of each ship, and extracting a percentage of the operating surplus or freight income for each trip. The civilian vessels are resolutely opposed, and the matter is still in stalemate. (2) Highway automobile transportation in various places is subject to the issuance of Japanese military passports by the Japanese company Dazhi Company. Thereafter, automobile transportation companies may not directly apply for them. The business operations and the number of goods carried by the vehicles are valued by the company, and a highway toll is collected based on the freight rate, ranging from ten to twenty yuan per vehicle. Transportation companies in this city are currently jointly discussing this matter and will take concerted action to resist the Japanese puppet regime.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Along Two Railways: Utter Terror; Tracks Sometimes Destroyed by Chinese; Organizing "Railway Defense Unit"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Shanghai branch line are sometimes damaged by Chinese plainclothes teams, and Japanese military vehicles often derail and overturn. The Japanese side, fearing that this will happen again, is actively organizing a "Railway Defense Unit." The Shanghai side has already been formed, with the headquarters located in the middle section of Qiu Jiang Road in Zhabei. The captain is Imai. It is reported that there are ten sub-teams, which are currently being organized. Japanese troops in Balianjing were wiped out. Waterway traffic in the southern Huangpu River was temporarily suspended yesterday (the 20th). The Japanese side imposed a blockade on various ferries. Fierce fighting broke out in the Balianjing area as guerrillas attacked Japanese troops stationed there. At that time, there were only about 40 Japanese soldiers, who were almost completely wiped out by the guerrillas. The Japanese side is mobilizing troops and attempting to counterattack. The Japanese are building fortresses in Chongming. Japanese troops have recently built a dozen fortresses at various strategic points along the coast of Chongming, and construction has now begun. It is suspected that they intend to control the gateway to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to supplement the strength of ground troops. Japanese troops in Luodian suffered losses in men and equipment. Various teams under the 6th Column of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force in the Jiangzhe border area fought with the Japanese in Luodian at about 7 p.m. last night (the 19th). The situation was very intense, and the Japanese forces were unable to hold out and retreated completely. They seized two machine guns, six Mauser pistols, dozens of rifles, and more than ten boxes of ammunition. Six Japanese soldiers were killed and dozens were injured. Residents in the northeast of Luodian fled one after another.</p>

<h3>Puppet "Municipal Government" Forcibly Sells Stamps; Merchants Resolutely Refuse to Buy; Hongkou Businesses All Clearly Understand the Greater Cause; Consistently Purchase and Affix National Government Stamps</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, shops in the two districts of the Public Concession and the French Concession have uniformly affixed the legal stamps of the National Government to fulfill the obligation of national taxpayers. However, the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government," with its resources exhausted, has recently been forcibly selling puppet "stamps" everywhere. In the Hongkou district of the concession area, the puppet "municipal government" salesmen have been forcibly selling fake stamps.</p>
<p>Forced Sales Door to Door Meet With Strong Rebuke</p>
<p>On the 19th, in shops along Yangshupu Road in Hongkou, salesmen suddenly appeared claiming to be puppet "municipal government" stamp salesmen, carrying fake stamps with thin paper, intending to forcibly take out the books and records of various businesses and force them to affix the fake stamps. At that time, the manager of a certain store on that road rebuked the salesman with indignation, saying that the store had already affixed the stamps of the National Government in accordance with the law. The puppet government has not been recognized by various countries, so how can it forcibly sell them in the Hongkou area of the concession? Moreover, who with any sense of righteousness would be willing to sell for the puppet municipal government?</p>
<p>Robbing Auxiliary Currency Is Akin to Thievery</p>
<p>Upon hearing these words, the salesman was dejected. Spotting someone buying an item at the store with twenty cents in legal tender, he actually snatched it, left a fake twenty-cent stamp on the counter, and left. Afterwards, the salesman went to other stores to continue to force sales, but was firmly rejected. The stores in Hongkou feel that since they pay concession police fees and tobacco and alcohol taxes on a quarterly basis, fulfilling their tax obligations, it is very dark to be subjected to such behavior, and Hongkou is shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>National Government Stamps Unanimously Purchased and Affixed</p>
<p>The paper of the fake stamps is extremely thin. The one-cent stamp has a pagoda and tripod pattern printed in the middle, and "Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Stamp Tax Ticket" is written on it. The words "Jiangsu Special Zone, Republic of China" are printed in imitation Song block letters. Currently, all stores in Hongkou have unanimously refused to use these fake stamps and affix National Government stamp taxes in accordance with regulations. From this, it can be seen that the puppet "municipal government" is racking its brains in vain.</p>
<h3>Claimed Japanese Naval Ship Spying on Zhenhai Fortress: Difficult to Confirm; Ente Telegraphed that Ningbo Is Safe; Ningbo Not Notified of Spying Vessel</h3>
<p>Last night's newspapers reported that, according to a report received by the shipping industry, at 1 p.m. on the 19th, a Japanese warship suddenly arrived at the Zhenhai estuary, spying on the Chinese fortress. The Chinese garrison opened fire, and the Japanese warship retreated. The Modern Society reporter inquired with the shipping departments of the German firm Rehder &amp; Co. and the Italian firm Sino-Italian Shipping Company (both of which have branches in Ningbo). They replied that the news was only seen in a special dispatch in this morning's Ningbo Public Bulletin. As of 6 p.m., the company had not received any telegrams from Ningbo. Therefore, the reliability of the news could not be confirmed, because if it was true, there would definitely have been a telegram from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Moufuk Steaming to Ningbo is Absolutely Untrue</p>
<p>In addition, the Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company's Ente Wheel, with the special permission of the military authorities of Zhejiang Province, loaded and shipped American wheat and arrived directly in Ningbo at 4 p.m. on the 17th. It entered the port at 1 p.m. the following afternoon and arrived safely in Ningbo. Yesterday, the company received a telegram stating that the American wheat had been unloaded on the 21st and they were currently loading goods for Shanghai, and would return to Shanghai around the 22nd or 23rd. The situation in Ningbo was safe, and there was no mention of the firing at the Zhenhai estuary or the Japanese warship spying on Ningbo. Therefore, according to observations from the shipping industry, the rumors were untrue. In addition, it was rumored in Shanghai yesterday that the German merchant Moufuk Wheel was about to sail to Ningbo, but the company stated that the news was absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>American Shipping Line to the Far East: Route Changes; Only the Coolidge Still Includes Shanghai on the Return Trip</h3>
<p>After the American firm Dollar Steamship Lines was reorganized in November of last year and renamed American President Lines, it resumed its Far East route. The route is slightly different from before the reorganization. After the resumption, the ships on the World Route will still not come to Shanghai. The Taft, Cleveland, and Pierce will ply the US-Japan-Shanghai-Hong Kong-Philippines route. For the past three months, from San Francisco to Japan, they have gone to Hong Kong and the Philippines. Returning to the US from the Philippines did not include Shanghai, but went to Japan via Hong Kong. Starting with the President Taft, which departed from San Francisco on the 24th of last month, the route has been changed. After arriving in Japan, it will sail directly to Hong Kong and the Philippines. Returning to the US from the Philippines, it will come to Shanghai via Hong Kong, then go to Japan and return to the US. Therefore, for the next three months, the company's ships will only come to Shanghai on their return to the US. Only the President Coolidge will still follow the original route, while the others will stop in this city. The Taft has already arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port at 8 a.m. on Monday (the 24th). The tender boat left the New Customs Pier at 7 a.m. and returned to the New Customs at 8:15 a.m. The ship is scheduled to weigh anchor at 11 p.m. that afternoon and head to Japan and then the US. The last tender boat for sending passengers will depart from the New Customs Pier at 9:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Postal Ship Guangdong to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow from Hong Kong; Feilun Scheduled to Return to Marseilles Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The British company's new postal ship Guangdong, which sailed from Shanghai on March 28th with cargo and passengers for Europe, collided with the General Zhafei on the sea between Shantou and Hong Kong at about 9 a.m. on the 30th. Both ships were seriously damaged. The Guangdong arrived in Hong Kong and was repaired immediately. All cargo bound for Europe was transferred to the company's branch, the Zhitelei (transliteration), to be shipped to Europe. The Zhafei also returned to Hong Kong for repairs after the collision. It is now reported that the Guangdong has been repaired and will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong tomorrow (the 23rd) at 2 p.m. It will berth at buoys 11 and 12 and will return to Europe on the 25th. The Zhafei suffered heavier damage and will not be able to leave the dock until early next month. It is scheduled to return to Marseilles from Shanghai on May 8th.</p>
<h3>Five Countries: China, Soviet Union, England, America, and France, Have Not Established a Joint Bank; So-Called Issuance of Banknotes is Clearly a Forgery by Someone; Ministry of Finance Telephoned Orders to Investigate and Ban This Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumors in Shanghai that China, the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and France had established a joint bank in Tianjin and issued banknotes jointly, the New Voice News Agency reporter inquired with various Chinese and foreign banks yesterday and received no reports from the North China branches. They also stated that it was practically impossible for China, the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and France to establish a joint bank and issue banknotes. If there are any such banknotes being issued, they are clearly counterfeits intended to disrupt the Chinese monetary system. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has consulted the provincial governments to investigate and ban them, saying, "The Ministry of Military and Political Affairs forwarded a telegram from Commander Wei Lihuang stating that on the 6th of this month, five-nation joint legal tender from China, the United States, Britain, France, and Russia were discovered in Bo'ai City, in denominations of one cent, two cents, five cents, one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. The banknotes are clearly a forgery by someone. In addition to instructing various departments to publicize and expose the conspiracy, we respectfully report this to you, requesting that you investigate and ban the use of such banknotes, and requesting the public to pay attention."</p>
<h3>Portuguese Ships Detained for Half a Month: Japanese Side Has Yet to Respond; Portuguese Consul Repeatedly Urges Inquiry; If No Results, Government Will Telegraph Domestic Government to Negotiate; Cargo of Detained Ships Has Been Allowed to Be Discharged</h3>
<p>Ten Portuguese merchant ships, including Hailong, Libao, Meida, Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu, Baode, Lude, Dade, and Fulü, have been seized by the Japanese navy since the 6th of this month in waters off Dinghai and in the Yangshupu River. The Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Alves, has repeatedly protested to the Japanese Consul and submitted written protests, demanding the immediate release of the detained ships. However, negotiations have been going on for half a month, and the Japanese side has yet to make a clear statement. As of yesterday, there has been no response to the Portuguese Consul's protest. The Portuguese merchants have expressed extreme indignation. According to news from the shipping industry, Portuguese Consul-General Alves was originally scheduled to go to the United States on the 16th to take up his new post, but he has postponed his departure due to the detained ships case. In order to resolve the matter quickly so that he can leave as soon as possible, he has decided to urge the Japanese Consulate to reply quickly, in order to understand the Japanese side's attitude and take appropriate measures. Since the ship seizure case occurred, the shipping operations of various Portuguese shipping companies in this city, such as Mei Li, Zhengde, Wanguo, Far East, Guo Side, and the American firm Huamei Company, which represents Portuguese ships, have all been suspended, resulting in huge daily losses. Therefore, representatives were sent to the Portuguese Consul to petition, requesting that the Portuguese Minister to Japan be telegraphed to lodge a protest with Tokyo. It is understood that the Consulate is unable to lodge a protest with Tokyo at this time because it has not yet received a reply from the Japanese Consul. Because the Japanese side has repeatedly delayed and prevaricated, and seems to disregard Portuguese-Japanese relations and diplomatic procedures, it has been decided to telegraph the circumstances to the domestic government for instructions on how to proceed. If necessary, the Ambassador to Japan will lodge a strong protest with Tokyo to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Portuguese merchants in China. The Portuguese side has negotiated for the cargo on the detained ships to be discharged first, but has not yet received results. Subsequently, the American firm negotiated on behalf of Tangbei, Tangqiao, and Tanglu, and were allowed to unload. All the cargo on the three ships has been unloaded. The shipping industry said that after continued negotiations, the cargo on the remaining Portuguese ships has also been allowed to be discharged. The Fulü began unloading the day before yesterday, and Baoli and Meida are also going through customs and port bureau procedures and can begin unloading today or tomorrow. The other ships will also be unloaded successively.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Industry and Others: Rectifying Discipline; Organizing a Sanctions Committee; Severe Punishment for Those Who Violate Oaths</h3>
<p>In order to rectify discipline and prevent the wavering of fellow traders, the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association is organizing a sanctions committee and has jointly allied with related parties: (1) South and North Markets, (2) Friendship Association of Various Pig Shops, (3) Owners of Various Pig Yards, (4) Yard Servants, (5) Pig Transportation Companies, etc. Each party has sent one representative to jointly organize the sanctions committee to formulate sanctions measures and pay close attention to the actions of all members of the industry, including managers, employees, and transportation personnel. If anyone violates the oath and the declared position stated in the joint declaration, and willingly sells their character and undermines public opinion, they must be reported to the sanctions committee for public discussion and sanctions, which will be strictly enforced, in order to rectify discipline and fight to the end.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Group: Safety Campaign; Publication of Letter to Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>After the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works established a safety campaign committee, it has held many meetings and decided to carry out separate campaigns for trams, buses, motorcycles, rickshaws, cars, and small vehicles. It was also decided to hold a propaganda week from June 3rd to 10th. The rickshaw group held a meeting yesterday and decided to form 50 teams, divided into areas such as the French Concession, the British Concession, north of the Suzhou River, and western Shanghai, and each team will be headed by a captain appointed by the association. The group also published a letter to rickshaw pullers, which reads in part: "According to a report from the police department, there were as many as 15,183 accident cases in the British and French Concessions last year, with 5,166 people killed or injured. This is such a terrifying record. Now the Bureau of Public Works has organized a 'Safety Campaign Committee' in order to eliminate these unfortunate events. What is a 'Safety Campaign'? A 'Safety Campaign' is to 'reduce accidents.' How can rickshaw pullers participate in the safety campaign? Please pay attention to the following points: First, pull the rickshaw steadily and do not bump into pedestrians. Second, at intersections, listen to the instructions of the police. Third, go forward on a green light and stop on a red light. Fourth, keep to the left and make a wide turn. Fifth, do not stop at intersections. Sixth, do not cross the road to solicit passengers. Seventh, do not carry two people or heavy goods. Eighth, do not carry dirty items. Ninth, do not carry people with infectious diseases. Rickshaw friends, a safety campaign is a life-saving campaign and is the most urgent matter at the moment. Please quickly implement the above nine things, which will save yourselves and others. Rickshaw friends, let's all join the safety campaign quickly."</p>
<h3>The Appraisal Committee Investigates Rice Stocks - The Authorities Express Gratitude</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Appraisal Committee received reply letters from the two concession authorities: (1) The French Municipal Council's letter states, "In response to your esteemed committee's letter of the 13th of this month, along with the attached inventory of rice stocks in various rice warehouses within the two concessions obtained from the two surveys by your committee, we are deeply grateful. The Council hopes that your committee will, in the future, after each survey of rice warehouse inventories is completed, immediately send a copy to the Council, which would be greatly appreciated." (2) The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement's letter states, "We have now received your letter of the 13th of this month and the Shanghai Rice Stock Statistics compiled by your esteemed committee. Thank you."</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Japanese Police Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police; Renamed the Second Foreign Division and Applies Revised Salary Scales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported on the upgrading of the Japanese Police Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Police's Intelligence Office announced the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Police, stating that the Council had considered the organizational structure of the Japanese Section of the Police Department last year and this year and decided to abolish the name "Japanese Section" from May 1st of this year. The Japanese Section has been renamed the Second Foreign Division, and the original Western Section has been renamed the First Foreign Division. Starting from the same date, the patrolmen of the Second Division will be renamed Probationary Sergeants. To maintain the police force of the Second Division and to easily recruit qualified personnel, the Council believes it is necessary to reconsider the salary scales. The revised salary scales have been set to apply to all ranks of police officers in the Second Division from May 1st. According to the scales, if police officers of the rank of Sergeant or above, after passing a trial, are deemed capable of performing the same duties and assuming the same responsibilities as police officers of the First Division, they may, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner of Police, receive the salaries of police officers of the First Division.</p>
<h3>British Ship "Silesia" Loading Salt - Intimidated and Detained by Japanese Warship - After British Ship "Scillia" Sailed to Protect, British Ship Proceeded as Normal to Load Salt and Head to Fuzhou</h3>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry in Shanghai, the British ship "Silesia," represented by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., loaded salt in Quanzhou Bay, Guangdong Province (east of Nan'ao), on the 8th of this month. While loading, a Japanese warship suddenly fired warning shots into the air from a distance, ordering them to stop. Subsequently, a Japanese motorboat carrying Japanese soldiers arrived and seized all the salt. The shipowner urgently reported this to the British Consulate in Shantou, which dispatched the British warship "Scillia," stationed in Shantou, to provide protection. The British ship had been transporting salt from the Quanzhou Bay area more than once. It had been interfered with by Japanese warships once before. Moreover, the salt was purely purchased by British merchants, so they argued based on reason. Now the ship has loaded the salt as normal and sailed to Fuzhou, and the British warship has also returned to Shantou.</p>
<h3>After Imported Goods are Released by Customs, No Objections Allowed; Declarations Cannot Be Amended, and Taxes Cannot be Claimed for Refund</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has re-established the rule that once imported goods declared by merchants have been released by the Customs, all items declared on the declaration form, as well as the classification and tax rates, cannot be amended again. Even taxes mistakenly reported or overpaid cannot be claimed for refund after the goods have been released. However, if amendments to the above items are desired, the goods must first be inspected or re-examined before a decision can be made on whether approval is possible. If the declared goods have already been released and the relevant documents have been returned in full, it is impossible to verify the validity of the request and there is no way to examine and verify the matter. Merchants should pay particular attention to the classification and tariff numbers of the goods before paying taxes. If there are any objections to the Customs' assessment or unclear points, they should immediately apply for a re-assessment. If an application for amendment or refund is made to the Customs after the tax has been collected, the Customs will not be able to consider or accept it.</p>
<h3>National Music Organizations Jointly Broadcast to Raise Funds - Seeking Participation to Join in the Grand Event</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Music Organizations Joint Broadcasting Fundraising Conference has already held a preparatory meeting, attended by representatives from various organizations such as the Postal National Music Group, Datong Music Society, Nanyang Model High School, Jingwu Cantonese Music Group, New Trend Music Society, Sun Sun Theatre, Friends' Voice Touring Troupe, and more, as well as over fifty people including Lu Gongbang, Xu Qiutian, and Ren Zimu. It is reported that the conference is scheduled to hold its second preparatory meeting at 3:00 PM on the 23rd of this month (Sunday) at the conference hall of the Refugee Relief Association, located on the fourth floor of 93 Sichuan Road, Guangdong Road. It also seeks enthusiastic participation from various national music organizations and renowned national musicians to join in the grand event.</p>
<h3>New Bus Route Added - Route 16 - Route 14 Extended - 47 New Buses Purchased</h3>
<p>The China General Omnibus Company held its 16th-anniversary meeting at Sassoon House at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Major. According to reports, although there was war last year, the number of passengers increased due to the influx of refugees from the Shanghai countryside seeking refuge in Shanghai. All vehicles felt the hardship of being insufficient to meet demand. The company has now added 47 new buses, worth 2.92 million yuan, including 26 double-decker buses and 21 single-decker buses. The buses are expected to be delivered before May of this year. Once they arrive, two buses will be added to service each week until all additions are completed. It is also planned to extend Route 14, which runs from the Bund to Avenue Foch, to Dunsing Road. In addition, a new Route 16 will be opened, running from Yichang Road, via Gordon Road, Chengdu Road, the Racecourse, and ending at Avenue Yu Qiaqing. The route application is currently awaiting approval from the Municipal Council. Once approved, it can be implemented. Although operations on routes north of Suzhou Creek were suspended due to the war, the company's average daily passenger count in the second half of last year was 190,408, far exceeding previous records. As a result, last year's profits were also higher than in previous years, amounting to 612,064.46 yuan. In the future, if Yangshupu is opened, the prosperity of the company's business will be even more evident.</p>

<h3>Japan Follows in the Footsteps of Germany and Italy - Encourages Marriage and Childbirth - Hopes Each Household Will Have Six Children - "Rearguard Plan" to be Implemented</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, an editorial in the Millard's Review, to be published tomorrow (the 22nd), states that Mr. Masujima, the recently appointed head of the "Living Section" of the Japanese Ministry of Welfare, has declared that his goal is "six children per Japanese household." He further stated that an agency to encourage childbirth and control the national population will soon be established. Among the countless "Rearguard Plans" proposed for national welfare during this critical period, increasing the Japanese population is the most important. Therefore, it is proposed that the Japanese should follow the examples of Germany and Italy by providing state subsidies to encourage marriage and childbirth. The obvious reason for the low birth rate is that Japan has lost 500,000 war dead since the outbreak of war in 1937. However, the authorities do not acknowledge this reason. Another credible reason for the low birth rate that Japanese leaders apparently have not taken into account is that over a million Japanese farmers have been sent to the mainland, resulting in delayed marriages and the general dispersion of millions of households. To cope with this situation, several suggestions have been made, including so-called "Bride Schools" and the proposal to mobilize 2,400 women to be trained and assigned to young volunteers sent to "Manchukuo."</p>

<h3>Too Many Parcels - Urgently Awaiting Clearance - Parcels to Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou Temporarily Suspended - But Small Medicine Parcels Accepted as Usual</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration resumed accepting large parcels and small packages to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces on the 17th of this month. However, due to the congestion of parcels, which have piled up like mountains, two announcements were issued yesterday: (1) Large Parcel Group: From the 20th of this month, all large parcels to Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces will be temporarily suspended. However, medicines and personal parcels to these provinces can still be accepted as usual. (2) Small Package Joint Dispatch Group: Due to the excessive number of packages received and the time required for clearance, all large and small packages to Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces will be temporarily suspended from the 20th of this month. However, medicines and personal small packages to these provinces can still be accepted as usual.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Hu Jianbo's Detention at the Fourth Hospital in the Refugee Zone - The Principal of a Puppet Elementary School Plotted to Seize the Hospital's Premises Unsuccessfully - The Japanese from the Puppet Police Station Falsely Accused Hu of Political Suspicion - The French Consul's Plea to Father Zhao Shen Saved Him from Danger</h3>
<p>Hu Jianbo, the director of the Fourth Hospital in the Nanshi Refugee Zone, began assisting with the Shi'en First and Second Refugee and Wounded Soldier Hospitals at 456 Jiujiang Road and No. 15 Ziler Lane, Nanjing Road, from the start of the August 13th Incident. When the Nanshi Refugee Zone was established, he contacted Father Shi Siming to organize the Fourth Hospital in the Refugee Zone, providing medical treatment and medicine at his own expense, managing it diligently, and benefiting the refugees. He also received enthusiastic support from new pharmaceutical companies such as Tu Kaizheng, Yuan Hesong, and Yao Junzhi. The hospital's address at 456 Yanhai Road, Nanshi, was rented from</p>
<p>Gu Dingyi, the principal of Zijing Elementary School. Unexpectedly, Zhou Zhirang, the principal of the puppet Municipal Fifth Elementary School, repeatedly plotted to seize the hospital's premises without success. He did not go after the Japanese military special service department Nanshi squad leader Horikawa Tsutomu summoned him for a talk. Then, together with Saito, a Japanese national from the puppet Nanshi District Police Station, he sent two puppet police chiefs to invite Hu for a talk. After arriving at the station, they only asked Hu, "Why do you disobey the military police's orders and refuse to move out?" Hu replied, "I rented the premises to run a charity and there is nothing wrong with that, so I did not move."</p>
<p>Saito was speechless and only said to wait downstairs for further discussion, and then detained him. At the same time, rumors were released, falsely accusing Hu of political suspicion, and saying that he would be investigated. On the other hand, he threatened the hospital staff to move out. Hu's wife then visited Mr. Asphe (transliteration), the French Consul in Shanghai, to report the incident. The French Consul was very enthusiastic about the refugee zone. In addition to comforting Hu's wife, he repeatedly pleaded with Father Zhao Shen to rescue him. On the tenth day, puppet officials and patrol officers declared to Hu that</p>
<p>It was a misunderstanding and that the investigation was clear. Mr. Hu not only had achieved great success in charitable work in the refugee zone, but also his character and knowledge were very high. This time, he was subjected to insults, etc., and after a few perfunctory words, the matter was concluded. It is now reported that the Fourth Hospital has moved to 105 Xiaoponong, continuing to work hard for the refugees, with further assistance from Tu, Yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Gambling Device "Slot Machine" - Manufacturing Organization Cracked - Two Machines and Parts Seized - Waiting to Arrest the Perpetrators for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Among gambling devices, there is one called "Slot Machine," which are mostly found in public entertainment venues, allowing people to openly place bets. Initially, it was touted as a game, but over time, the police authorities discovered that this type of game was actually enticing gambling and deception. Therefore, it was strictly investigated and banned, and offenders were severely punished. But recently, there seem to be fewer openly displayed ones, but there are still many secretly prepared ones. Moreover, there are some who are good at speculation. Seeing that the prices of all imported goods have soared, the demand for this kind of slot machine is quite high. Therefore, they established a specialized factory in a bungalow at No. 80, Lane 711, Chengdu Road, constructing them in the same manner. The French Concession police recently seized this type of machine gambling device at No. 746 Avenue Joffre. According to the suspect, the machine was purchased from the factory. The French police then notified the Xinzha police station and applied to the First Special District Court for a hot search warrant. Detective Wang Pingsen and Chinese and Western detective chiefs Li Shizhong, etc., went to the house according to the address. After searching, they seized two finished gambling devices and many other parts. However, the perpetrators had all fled. Yesterday morning, the investigating detectives sent a part of the items to the court, and the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested that the gambling device be seized first. At the same time, the police continue to investigate. Judge Zhong approved the request, ordering the gambling devices to be stored in the warehouse, awaiting review and handling.</p>
<h3>Creditors of the Pu Hai Bank Urged to Register Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the Minhang Pu Hai Commercial Savings Bank reconciliation case, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened a creditors' meeting on April 8 to discuss the reconciliation plan. At that time, the meeting could not be convened because the number of creditors attending did not meet the legal quorum. Now, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has re-notified that creditors should register from now on, and another meeting will be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Escorting Opium - Six Armed Bandits Intercepted and Robbed - Eight Cans of Opium, Each Weighing 100 Pounds, Escorted by Ten Puppet Police Officers - While Traveling North from Suzhou Creek to Bailey Road, Suddenly Encountered Highway Robbery - Puppet Police Disarmed and Driven Out - Bandits Drove Away</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, "Just after 5:30 AM this morning (the 21st), the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company received a phone call for a rental truck and dispatched a truck to a location in the Japanese-controlled area north of Suzhou Creek. Ten 'Great Way' police officers loaded eight cans of opium, each weighing 100 pounds, into the truck. Then seven 'Great Way' police officers, two of whom were armed with pistols, boarded to protect it and instructed the driver to head towards Wujiaochang on Bailey Road. When they arrived within a few yards of Wujiaochang, and near where there were no public concession police, they were suddenly met by six armed bandits. Because the road was narrow and there was a lot of traffic, the driver could not speed past. Pedestrians, seeing the situation, scattered to avoid the line of fire. The 'Great Way' police, in their shock, raised their hands high along with the driver. The bandits quickly searched the 'Great Way' police and took the pistols from the two officers, ordering them to get out of the truck and return the way they came. Then one bandit boarded the truck and took the driver's seat, another sat beside him, and the remaining bandits boarded the truck and pointed their guns at the retreating 'Great Way' police. The truck made a turn and the bandits put their guns back in their bags. Afterwards, the driver immediately reported the incident to the police, who reported it to various police stations and began searching. One or two hours later, the hijacked truck was found parked on Zhu Bao San Road, empty. It was then returned to the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company."</p>
<h3>Stealing the Name of "Three Principles of the People Youth League" - Extortion and Fraud - Arrested - Six Shameless Youths Formed Two Factions - Arrested for Extorting Yang Xueqiao</h3>
<p>Peng Jiangtian, Zhang Xingzhi, Liu Liansheng (also known as Liu Deren), Zhu Shaoliang (also known as Zhu Xudong), Chen Xueming, and Qi Renzhang, all from Shanghai, had a middle school education or higher. Peng, Zhang, and Liu opened the Times Service Company at 332 Avenue Yu Qiaqing, while Zhu, Chen, and Qi founded the China News Agency in Room 514 of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, with Qi serving as president. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Peng Hongtian and Zhu Xudong</p>
<p>Seized the opportunity to impersonate the so-called "Shanghai Third Brigade Eighth Detachment of the Three Principles of the People Youth League." They printed a large number of letters and distributed them according to the Shanghai Who's Who. Peng and others then went to the addresses several days after sending the letters, threatening and extorting large sums of money. The Fuxin Tobacco Company in this city was once bombed for 200 yuan. Later, because Peng and Zhu disagreed on how to divide the loot, they split up. Peng then recruited Zhang Xingzhi and Liu Liansheng, while Zhu recruited Chen Xueming and Qi Renzhang to continue their</p>
<p>Impersonation and extortion work. However, Peng and Zhu acted independently and did not cooperate. Although Chen Xueming belonged to Zhu and Qi's faction, he still flirted with Peng's faction and exchanged information. Recently, Zhu, Chen, and Qi learned that Yang Xueqiao, the owner of Yang Dingyuan Cotton Mill at No. 20 Jinlong Street, Henan Road, had served as the "Chairman of the Maintenance Association" in Qibao Town, West Shanghai, organized by a certain party after the retreat of the National Army.</p>
<p>Oppressing the villagers and trading his cotton products with a certain party, they relied on this topic. At 11:00 AM on the 9th of this month, the three of them went to Yang's residence, threatening Yang Xueqiao, saying that if he did not offer a large sum of money, they would publish his past crimes in the newspapers. At the same time, they threatened him with harsh words. Yang was afraid and immediately gave 150 yuan to Qi and the others, and they left together. However, this news was passed on to Peng Hongtian and his group by Chen Xueming. Peng believed that Yang</p>
<p>Had these bad deeds, it could be used to extort a larger sum of money. So, on the morning of the 13th, Peng, Zhang, and Liu went to Yang's residence and first delivered a letter from the fake "Three Principles of the People Youth League." Then they said that if he did not offer them 4,000 yuan, not only would they announce his bad deeds to society, making him an outcast, but also the lives of his entire family would be in danger. Yang's son, Yang Shudong, happened to be there and used a sanitary gun to stop Peng's actions. Peng and others tried to escape, and Yang's son</p>
<p>Fired a warning shot, and Peng and others dared not move. Hua detective chief Wang Chengying, Jiang Shangpei, and Yang Peisheng from the General Patrol Bureau received the report and rushed to the scene, arresting Peng and his group. Then, Zhu, Chen, and Qi were arrested at the Daxin Teahouse. The letters and seals of the fake "Three Principles of the People Youth League" were seized at the Times Service Company. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court to hear the case. Qi Renzhang hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Police lawyer Ru Bao</p>
<p>Chen Ming narrated the above facts, filing charges under the criminal law for completed and attempted extortion and fraud. He also stated that Sha Jintang at 391 Mintili Road, who made the seals for the defendants, and Chen Ming, the owner of Liwen Printing House at 423 Kangdi, who printed the letters, were being investigated by the French police, so they could not be present in court today. He also stated that the defendants had committed many crimes and that they could not be investigated in a short time, so he requested a postponement for further interrogation. The court then questioned Yang Xueqiao and his son and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, postponing the interrogation for a week to investigate further.</p>
<h3>The Shooting on Yuyuan Road the Night Before - Detective Fired Gun to Pursue the Murderer - Exchanged Multiple Shots with Three Bandits - Tea Merchant Injured, Bandits Escaped</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, at approximately 8:00 PM on Wednesday, three bandits on Yuyuan Road attempted to rob a tea merchant. They fled into Lane 1125, where one bandit shot and wounded the tea merchant. It was learned yesterday (the 20th) that the pistol used by the bandit had a long record in police history. According to the tea merchant's interrogation of the police, he had just gotten off the No. 9 bus when he was attacked, intending to go to the Hollywood Amusement Park. The details of the case are as follows: After the tea merchant got off the bus, he was met by thugs who ordered him to go with them, presumably intending to rob him in a dark alley. Fortunately, detective Clayton and his wife had also gotten off the bus at the same stop a few minutes earlier. Seeing the suspicious behavior of the three men, he pushed his wife between two buses to avoid the line of fire. Then he saw one of the bandits take a box cannon out of his coat and force the tea merchant to go with him. Clayton was quite calm and went to the other side of the road with his wife, telling her to take temporary refuge in a nearby alley. He then loaded live ammunition into his service pistol, but the sound of the ammunition being loaded was heard by the thugs, who immediately fired a shot at Clayton. Clayton then returned three shots but missed. The bandit then fired a shot at the tea merchant, who had been pushed to the ground by the other two bandits, and then fled into the alley. Clayton pursued them and fired two more shots. One bandit staggered a few steps, but managed to escape when Clayton's vision was blocked by several pedestrians in the alley. At the same time, the tea merchant, who had suffered a minor injury to his right leg, ran wildly along Yuyuan Road. Clayton caught up with him and escorted him back to his residence, reporting the incident to the Jing'an Temple Road police station.</p>

<h3>South Huizhou Da Zhang Silk Store Relocates to Shanghai: Manager Accused of Embezzlement; Shareholders Demand Audit, Refused; Defendant Summoned for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Wang Zhonglin of South Huizhou, 29 years old this year, and his brother-in-law Qiu Dasheng jointly opened the Da Zhang Silk Store on North Gate Street in South Huizhou in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), with a total capital of 5,000 yuan. Wang invested 3,500 yuan, and Qiu invested 1,500 yuan. Wang served as the manager, fully managing the store's business and financial transactions. There was a yearly surplus. After Qiu Dasheng passed away, Wang, believing he could take advantage of his widowed sister-in-law, Qiu Wang's family, never reported the store's accounts. After the outbreak of war, Wang moved the Da Zhang store's inventory to Shanghai, renting the premises at No. 55 Nanhe Le Lane, West Aixian Road, in the French Concession to continue operating. Now, Qiu Wang's family (35 years old, from South Huizhou, currently residing opposite No. 6 Wangjia Lane, Daxi Road), because her request to Wang Zhonglin for an audit was unsuccessful, appointed lawyer Xi Mengqi to represent her. She filed a complaint with the Special No. 2 Court's Criminal Division, accusing Wang Zhonglin of breach of trust and embezzlement, and additionally filed a civil suit to recover the inventory and require the submission of account books. The complaint roughly stated that the plaintiff is one of the shareholders of the Da Zhang Silk Store, and the defendant is the major shareholder and manager. He has never reported the accounts or the business situation. After the war, the defendant transported the store's inventory to Shanghai to continue operating. When she requested an audit, he refused. After sending a letter through a lawyer, the defendant only submitted 15 incomplete account books, and also refused permission to inspect the inventory, claiming it was lost. He also refused to hand over important account books. Upon checking the submitted accounts, there were hundreds of yuan allegedly embezzled by the defendant. She requested that the court summon the defendant in accordance with Articles 336 and 342 of the Criminal Law to investigate the matter. According to the complaint, the court, based on the complaint, summoned both parties by Judge Liao Yuan at the Criminal Division No. 2 yesterday afternoon, both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's representative lawyer stated the grounds of the prosecution and claimed that the defendant had committed embezzlement since October of the 27th year (1938) when he moved the store to his jurisdiction to operate. They requested an investigation and submitted the account books as evidence. The defendant's defense lawyer first raised the issue of jurisdiction and then stated that the defendant was unable to attend court today due to illness and because he resides in the British Concession. The court, upon reviewing the statements, decided that it could not proceed with the trial due to the defendant's absence and adjourned the case, ordering the defendant to appear for further questioning at 3:00 PM on May 1st.</p>
<h3>Female Bandit Army Discovered in Pudong: Kidnapping for Ransom</h3>
<p>Banditry and false governments' kidnapping for ransom are rampant in Pudong. Recently, a female bandit leader named Jin Fenying has emerged, and with her husband, Jin A'xi, she leads a gang of twenty-eighty men, entrenched on the border of Upper River. The other day, they broke into the town of Jinjia Lane, within the Shanghai city limits, kidnapped farmer Jin Xiaobao, and demanded a ransom of two thousand yuan. He has not yet been rescued. The hostage is over sixty years old.</p>
<h3>Forged and Sold Curfew Passes in Concessions; Zhiyuan Hotel Raided, Perpetrators Arrested with Evidence</h3>
<p>Since the war, two types of passes have been issued in Shanghai in response to the needs of the times. One type is issued by the Japanese military for people traveling to and from their occupied areas. This type of pass has been repeatedly imitated and forged and sold everywhere. Recently, the Hongkou Police Station cracked down on a counterfeit pass operation at the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road, and the perpetrators Wang Shide and Zhu A'da are still in custody and under investigation. The other type is issued by the Concession Police Department, and holders of this pass are allowed to travel freely throughout the Concession even during curfew hours. However, the issuance of this pass requires various legal procedures and must be applied for in person. Third-party applications and sales are strictly prohibited, so there have been no reports of forgery and sale. However, the other night, a rickshaw driver from Tongzhou named Lu Jindao was driving north across the Sichuan Road Bridge when he was stopped by a Japanese constable at No. 236. Upon inspection of his pass, it was discovered to be a counterfeit, and he was immediately arrested. Under questioning, he claimed to have purchased it from Zhou Baochang and Rong Yaogen, two Ningbo natives in Room 234 of the Zhiyuan Hotel on Tianjin Road. The police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Zhou and Rong and seized a forged pass, 96 applications submitted by applicants, 296 guarantee forms, 400 cards, and nine account books in the room. They were taken to the Hongkou Police Station. Under interrogation, they confessed to purchasing them from Zhang Huishou, a native of Linghu, Huzhou, who in turn purchased them from a Wuxi native. The two were then arrested, but Zhang claimed that he also purchased them from a Frenchman for five yuan each and sold them for five yuan and five jiao. Yesterday morning, the police station transferred Zhou and others to the First Special District Local Court. After a brief hearing by Judge Zhong, he approved the request of the police lawyer Zhu to detain the suspects, and adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>
<p>According to another report, a Chinese resident who had obtained a Hongkou District pass from the Japanese military was stopped in Hongkou yesterday and had his pass confiscated by the Japanese military, who also detained the holder. When some of them asked for the reason, they were insulted by the Japanese military. A total of more than 400 people had their passes confiscated in one day, and the detainees were not released until dusk. As for the reason for the confiscation of the passes, the Japanese military claimed that the unit that issued the passes had been transferred elsewhere and were no longer valid, hence the confiscation. However, according to the reporter's speculation, this statement by the Japanese military is definitely not the truth. However, the reporter vaguely heard that all the confiscated passes were obtained by freight companies from French merchants, who then transferred them to the Japanese military headquarters.</p>
<h3>Motorcycle Speeds and Kills Young Woman; Girl Fell to Death After Emergency Brake to Avoid Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Xu Shiyuan, over thirty years old, residing at No. 569, Lane 81, Albert Road in the French Concession, was riding his motorcycle around 6:45 PM on the other day (the 20th), with his sister Xu Lanfen (26 years old) riding behind him. As they were speeding east to west past No. 769 Avenue Joffre, a woman named Wang Fengying suddenly crossed the road. Xu braked sharply to avoid her, causing Xu Lanfen, who was sitting behind, to be violently jolted by the motorcycle. Unable to control herself, she was thrown to the ground, cracking her skull and suffering severe injuries all over her body, with blood gushing out. The nearby patrol constable heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, summoning an ambulance to rush her to Guangci Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and she died shortly after. Yesterday morning, the court was notified and sent personnel to investigate. The family then transported the body to the Shanghai Funeral Home for preparation for burial.</p>
<h3>Gold Bar Robbery: Robbery Also Occurred on Zhejiang Road Last Night</h3>
<p>At about 2:10 PM yesterday, a man with a lavish demeanor suddenly went to a gold shop at No. 402 Guangdong Road, pretending to be a customer and claiming to buy and sell cash. The shop treated him with genuine suspicion, so they took out gold bars and other items to negotiate prices. Unexpectedly, upon seeing the glittering gold, the man immediately pulled out a pistol, ordered the people in the shop not to move, and took the opportunity to grab the gold bars and miscellaneous banknotes and silver dollars on the table and flee. According to the people in the shop, the total loss amounted to more than 8,000 gold yuan, but they were unable to pursue him, so they reported to the police station and requested a pursuit. After receiving the news, the police station immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene to investigate and inquire about the incident in detail for investigation. At about 7:45 PM yesterday, at No. 14, Lane 575, Zhejiang Road, seven or eight robbers suddenly went to rob. Among them, only three robbers had pistols. One was on the lookout, and one was watching over the men and women in the house in the corner, while the remaining robbers divided up and searched each room. After about half an hour, they looted and fled. The total amount of jewelry, clothing, money, and banknotes stolen was very large, and it was difficult to estimate accurately for a while. Afterward, the victim reported to the police station and requested a pursuit.</p>
<h3>Hollywood: Truth About the Homicide; Zhou Zhongfa Killed; Dong Chunsheng Detained</h3>
<p>Around 5:00 PM on April 20th, a shooting was reported in the "Hollywood" gambling den in the extra-boundary area of Yu Garden Road in Western Shanghai. This reporter made a special trip to investigate and learned that the report was inaccurate, but the shooting was a fact. It turned out that a Changzhou native named Zhou Zhongfa was working as a "hugger" in the Hollywood gambling den, that is, a disciple of the den's manager Zhu Shunlin. At the same time, another person named Dong Chunsheng, from Hubei, was Zhu's grand-disciple, and also working as a "hugger" in the den. At 5:00 PM on the other day (20th), Dong suddenly fired a gun at Zhou, causing Zhou to be injured. The incident caused a great disturbance in the den. Afterward, Zhou was sent to the hospital for treatment by bystanders, but he died due to his serious injuries. Zhou's wife, feeling resentful that her husband had died unexpectedly, went to Dong to fight him. But Dong insisted that the incident was unintentional and that there was no animosity. Zhou's wife claimed that Dong had flirted with her and was reprimanded by her, so he acted viciously. The two argued endlessly. The news was received by the pseudo "Municipal Police Bureau," which sent pseudo "police" to the scene, who arrested both parties. After interrogating Dong, he confessed that the gun used in the crime was supplied by a person named Liu Bingyuan, who was also in "Hollywood." Therefore, Liu Bingyuan was also arrested afterward. However, it was learned yesterday that Liu Bingyuan had been released, and Dong Chunsheng was still in custody. The truth behind the scenes is unknown to outsiders.</p>

<h3>Loyalty and National Salvation Army Fan's Troops Attack and Suppress Zhang Xu's Puppet Army; Xu Xinzhou Captured and Executed; Zhang Miaogen's Troops Forced to Flee in Disarray</h3>
<p>The area north of Dujiahang in Pudong is the stronghold of the Japanese puppet army, Zhang Miaogen and Xu Xinzhou. They committed all kinds of evil deeds, including rape, robbery, and kidnapping for ransom, which were carried out brazenly. As a result, the general residents were exhausted and suffering unspeakably.

<p>(8) On the one hand, provide appropriate teaching materials, train private school teachers and teachers in private schools so that they can take responsibility for training themselves; on the other hand, formulate measures to require physical education teachers or instructors in schools at all levels or stadiums to assist voluntarily, so that adults, young people, and children receiving remedial education can simultaneously have an appropriate amount of physical education, in order to create preliminary facilities for popularizing national physical education. (10) Actively enrich the content and increase the number of sports fields and recreational activity places for women and children, hold various physical and mental activities, and provide opportunities for the public to participate at any time, to create a trend of improving social life and achieving the goal of strengthening the nation. (11) Physical activities in the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors should be promoted. Any group or organization should have a physical education organization to lead and manage the sports associations of its staff. Widespread organization should be encouraged for those who achieve results, and the government should provide financial subsidies or assistance to promote the natural development of social sports. (13) Establish standards for national physical fitness using scientific methods, strive for practical implementation, and based on the test results, create statistics for comparison to show the progress of national physical fitness. At the same time, edit a small booklet of National Physical Education Guidelines, detailing the meaning and methods of physical education and hygiene, to prepare the public for physical exercise and daily hygiene. (14) The training of physical education teachers should be planned and managed by the competent educational administrative authorities to fully cultivate qualified and capable teachers and administrative personnel, who will be responsible for promoting school and community physical education and health education. The training curriculum should be effectively adjusted, with listed outlines and definite content to ensure a certain standard. In addition to specialized academic knowledge, training methods should especially focus on cultivating abilities and character, to become true role models and leaders for young people. (15) Existing physical education and health education teachers should be given opportunities for refresher courses and further studies, and if necessary, the government should enforce this. The country should be divided into several regions, and short-term training classes should be established. Anyone who has served in education for three years must attend a class for training once to absorb new knowledge and research new methods, so that they can keep up with the times and permanently maintain the latest and most effective teaching methods. (16) In-depth research on physical education academics should be earnestly promoted and rewarded. Universities and teachers' colleges' physical education departments should establish research classes. Each year, public-funded scholarships should be established for physical education, and those who have received advanced physical education training and have proven teaching experience should be selected to go to developed countries to study their physical education facilities, advancing both theoretically and practically, and improving the efficiency of domestic physical education research facilities. The writing of physical education academic works should be encouraged. (17) The implementation of physical education should have an overall plan, concrete programs, and reasonable standards, followed by strict assessments and effective supervision, implementing them in order of urgency and importance, to achieve the goals within a certain period.</p>
<h3>### Talk by Responsible Person of Small School Principals' Association</h3>
<p>The Small School Principals' Association of this city has been established for many years. This time, to expand the organization and strengthen unity, the current board of directors decided to add more directors. Currently, there are 49 directors in total. The first plenary meeting of the board of directors was held a few days ago, electing 21 standing directors and resolving various cases. The news was published in the newspaper. Yesterday, the responsible person of the association made a statement to the Shanghai Voice News reporter, expressing surprise that today (the 21st), newspapers carried news about the association's standing board meeting. Upon investigation, the association has not yet held its first standing board meeting since the first plenary meeting of the board of directors. The source of this news is unknown and appears to have other motives, attempting to confuse right and wrong. The standing directors of the association, Xu Zexiang, currently serves as the principal of Wanbai Elementary School, and Li Liuyao currently serves as the principal of Zhongxin Elementary School. The claims that both Mr. Xu and Mr. Li are not principals and have been asked to resign are completely false. In short, the association has not convened a standing board meeting, so where did these resolutions come from? An investigation is currently underway.</p>

<p>The Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties, which opened on April 11th on the fourth floor of the Great New World Building, was originally scheduled to last only ten days.

<h3>A Fork in the Road of Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The content of politics is certainly very complex, and the process of diplomacy is especially full of forks. With so many forks, not knowing which way to go, there will of course be the result of "losing the sheep." Choosing the path carelessly and mistakenly entering a wrong path will also fail to achieve a proper goal.</p>
<p>The neighboring country that is invading us used "waterfowl diplomacy" to deal with us in the past. This meant that on the surface, like a waterfowl, its body floats on the water, with a peaceful atmosphere, while its claws are hidden underwater, doing everything possible to hook and seize. Therefore, while they were negotiating and talking about friendship with us, they were also nibbling away and annexing, from the four northeastern provinces to North China, forcing us to start the war of resistance at Lugou Bridge. This is the result of them going down the wrong path.</p>
<p>England, the initiator of the anti-aggression alliance, seems to have determined its proper path from the "not knowing which way to go" process. However, we now hear that Chamberlain seems to be adopting a diplomacy of "carrots and sticks." The government he leads is on the one hand organizing collective security, and on the other hand is willing to express goodwill toward Germany and is willing to conduct economic negotiations with Germany. Even worse, some people say that England is secretly persuading Poland to peacefully return Danzig to Germany. This is of course dangerous; if this policy continues to be implemented, it is inevitable that England's diplomacy will go down the wrong path and lead to bad results.</p>
<p>The neighboring country that is invading us is said to be now "wandering on a fork in the road" with regard to diplomacy. Its warlords want to join the anti-communist military alliance, while the diplomatic community "believes that it is more advantageous to get closer to democratic countries, otherwise, it may go down the path of suicide." We don't know whether they will take the right path or the wrong path in the future, but I think that if they don't want to commit suicide, they should not take the wrong path and get closer to democratic countries.</p>
<p>There are too many forks in diplomacy, and the wrong paths among the forks can be said to be dead ends, especially so many that they cannot be counted. Only wise government authorities can distinguish them clearly and implement them thoroughly on the right path. Apart from the fact that we already have a definite position, a thorough war of resistance, and the completion of the great cause of national construction, and are taking the broad path, the United States has now clearly expressed its attitude. The Neutrality Act and isolationists have become insignificant details due to Roosevelt's declaration. We and the United States are also proud of our diplomacy today.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are many forks in the road of diplomacy, but in the end, there is only one right path in it. I hope that every government authority can find this right path, and that recovering the "lost sheep" will be laying the foundation for world peace, co-existence and co-prosperity.</p>
<h3>The Dummy (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>He was over forty years old and was called Wang Benzhong. But in our team, everyone called him Wang Dumb-Bug, or sometimes simply Dumb-Bug, without mentioning his surname.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a casual nickname; he really was dumb, and because Benzhong and Dumb-Bug sounded similar, it stuck.</p>
<p>The team leader first met him and, apart from his name, he couldn't say much clearly. Later, after asking the townspeople, they found out that he wasn't a local; he had come here with his parents when he was young, and had been drifting around here ever since his parents died. The townspeople also said that he knew nothing except eating and sleeping; he was capable of nothing except having the strength to carry water and things for people. Alone, he had grown from a child to an adult, from</p>
<p>However, when the team leader asked him why he wanted to join the team, he was able to say that ×× was really hateful and that he wanted to kill ×× people. The team leader said that he knew this, which wasn't too dumb; and seeing that he was completely unencumbered, honest, and strong, he might be useful somewhere, so the team leader agreed to let him join our team.</p>
<p>However, he turned out to be dumb. He couldn't drill. No matter how we taught him, when he started to march, it was either his left hand and left foot moving forward together, or his right hand and right foot moving backward together; or, he would just clamp both hands to his body and not move at all. When the team leader told us to pay attention to the target in front and not to look around, he really didn't look anywhere else, just staring straight ahead. He couldn't even hear the team leader's other commands, so he would either fall behind the team or rush ahead of the team.</p>
<p>A rifle on his shoulder was slung diagonally, like carrying a carrying pole. He couldn't break the habit. Teaching him to fire a gun was even worse! Unloading the gun, loading the bullets, aiming, pulling the trigger – he would forget one thing after learning another. He could never get it right. One day, the team leader got angry and said to him: "If you can't fire a gun, how can you fight?" He just smiled and said, "That doesn't matter, I can stab with a knife."</p>
<p>So everyone still laughed at him, saying that he was still dumb after all: he couldn't fire a gun, he could only stab with a knife.</p>
<p>Indeed, in addition to a rifle, we each had a large knife. He, Dumb-Bug, no, Wang Benzhong, not only couldn't fire a gun, but he couldn't even clean it, because he couldn't take the parts apart or put them back together. He could only sharpen his knife. Every day he would sharpen his knife until it was gleaming and incredibly sharp.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, he had done a lot of dumb things in our team. For example, if we said that whoever ate the most was a hero, he would definitely eat more than anyone else, preferring to lean against the wall and choke, clutching his stomach. As long as we praised him for being strong, when moving things, we could load them all onto his shoulders. Even if it weighed him down so much that he could barely stand straight, he would never refuse. When we raced, he couldn't run faster than us, of course, but he would always run to the end, panting and out of breath. …</p>
<p>That night, the team leader arranged a plan to attack Huazhen. Huazhen originally had no × troops, but today five or sixty people had come from the city, saying they were there to search for guerrillas, and because they didn't have time to return to the city, they stayed in the Wu family ancestral hall on the edge of town. The team leader distributed people in the front and back of the ancestral hall, waiting for his gunshot to signal everyone to attack from both sides. He also arranged several roadblocks on the main road leading from the ancestral hall to outside the town, to intercept.</p>
<p>Wang Benzhong was following the team leader in the front. He was very happy. Tonight he could actually kill ×× people, so he waved the knife in his hand in the air. As for the gun, he had long given up on it because he couldn't learn how to fire it.</p>
<p>In the dark, silent night, the team leader fired a shot. The front and back of the Wu family ancestral hall erupted with gunfire, like popping sesame seeds. But strangely, there was no sound inside, and the expected return fire came from behind them.</p>
<h3>New Clothes for Spring</h3>
<h3>From New Enlightenment Movement to Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>The New Enlightenment Movement is the most urgently needed cultural and intellectual movement to promote at present. As China's war of resistance has progressed to the current stage, there is no doubt that we need a stronger national consciousness to complete the task of nation-building. Although culture and thought belong to the realm of ideas, they are indispensable driving forces for social development. The reason why we can build such a strong and resilient national united front today, and launch such a great war of resistance, is entirely due to the common belief and thought of resisting aggression and defending against insults that are shared by the entire nation. Although any thought originates from practice, in order to make practice effective, various thoughts should be carefully studied and criticized to make them consistent with practice; only after the thoughts of the people throughout the country have been naturally integrated can a unified opinion be fully expressed, and only then can human and material resources be fully utilized. Therefore, in today's China, based on the requirements of practical development, it is extremely urgent to extensively promote the New Enlightenment Movement in terms of thought and culture, unify the views of all parties, and establish a solid ideological front to defeat various unsound thoughts during the war of resistance, and to sweep away various distorted traditional theories.</p>
<p>From this point, we must pay attention to the national spiritual mobilization that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has revealed to us. As the current war of resistance progresses to the second stage, and the enemy is in a dilemma, the proposal of the outline of spiritual mobilization can not only strengthen our spiritual consciousness, penetrate the determination to resist aggression and defend against insults, and lay the foundation for a unified national thought, but also indicate the common goal of Chinese thought at the present stage, as an important preparation for the future construction of a new China. I think this, like the New Enlightenment Movement, is a necessary movement to promote national spiritual armament.</p>
<p>The outline of spiritual mobilization stipulates the tasks that Chinese citizens should fulfill today, and requires us to regard the nation-state as a prerequisite, concentrate our thoughts and will, and strive for survival; it also proposes that the ultimate goal of the war of resistance is to establish an independent, free, equal, and a republic of the Three People's Principles of the people, by the people, and for the people. Eliminating selfish and self-interested feudal ideas and establishing a new outlook on life necessary during the war of resistance can be said to be the backbone of spiritual mobilization. Judging from the aspects of transforming the national spirit, eradicating traditional bad habits, and actively enriching and concentrating national will alone, it can be known that spiritual mobilization not only provides the path that China's future ideological movement should take, but also is a higher stage of development for national unity against foreign enemies. From the union of all parties, factions, and strata, to the unification of thought and the concentration of energy, therefore, all traitorous thoughts that shake the war of resistance, undermine national unity, and harm national interests should be completely eliminated so that the ideals of democratic politics can be realized.</p>
<p>However, in order to achieve the various common goals of spiritual mobilization, we must still strive to promote the mass knowledge movement, that is to say, we cannot ignore the unfolding of the New Enlightenment Movement in thought to complete the final task of resisting the war and building the country.</p>
<p>In the process of the Second War of Resistance, we should pay attention to military development, and mobilizing the thoughts of a nation is also indispensable; therefore, we urgently need to eliminate all traditional thoughts that are not conducive to the war of resistance, and promote the spiritual foundation for building a new China. If we recognize the importance of the New Enlightenment Movement for resisting the war and building the country, then we should accept the outline of spiritual mobilization to form a broad ideological front and serve as the main basis for practice!</p>
<h3>Toward Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>Beside shallow ponds, in desolate suburban wildernesses, beside drooping willow-lined ancient roads, in secluded deep mountains, or even in small semi-acre gardens, after several nights of rain, when the weather clears, a cheerful laughter is revealed, telling us: the spring deepens, and life grows more and more vigorously.</p>
<p>"Where can't fragrant grass be found in the world?" Even in the yellow desert stretching for thousands of miles, there is bound to be a patch of lush greenery near the water, giving travelers relief from the hunger and thirst of the heart.</p>
<p>Sowing a handful of seeds of life in the universe often symbolizes the vitality of life. If footsteps trample it, it will grow taller; if frost and snow destroy it, it will receive more warmth; if wildfires scorch it, it will be reborn when the spring breeze rises. It comes from struggle and will also go to struggle. For thousands of years, it will always have its share of life, occupying a place in the universe. It has never been swallowed by the cold winter, succumbed to death, or destroyed by violence; what is pressed down, it will push higher; what is squeezed tight, it will push aside; what is crowded close, it will push away; what is seized, it will take back; what is struck, it will fight back; what is dormant, it will unfold. —Beside shallow ponds,...</p>
<p>Following the deep spring, the weeds grow taller day by day. In the warm sunshine, flowers bloom and fall again and again. The warmer the sunshine, the deeper the spring, and the more vigorous the vitality. It is unlike the bleakness of Wushan and Wuxia, nor is it like the jade dew when the wind is strong and the sky is high. The past desolation disappears into the dust. The clear verdure and distant fragrance are exchanged for a passionate style of writing.</p>
<p>Forgetting the misfortune of yesterday, we see the wild grass climbing up the soil again. With the posture of a warrior, it smiles at us, wishing us each a spring.</p>
<p>We are grateful and surprised.</p>
<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>"I come from struggle."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"To struggle."</p>
<p>It sat down, sitting on the bedrock of the "earth."</p>
<p>It told us many stories. Falling into past memories, it laughed for a while and then solemnly shed tears. It spoke for a whole day and a whole night, fluently, vividly, innocently, gently, and profoundly.</p>
<p>In the gentle spring breeze, the face of the wild grass shone with light. The past hardships have now become fond memories. Remembering the tears of the past sprouts today's laughter.</p>
<p>Spring is still shallow, the weather is still slightly cold, and the grass is not yet very lush. Although it is already thriving, it must be even more lush, even taller, even denser, and even more expansive.</p>
<p>"I wish you also have a good spring." We replied with a smile.</p>
<h3>Self-conscience Test</h3>
<p>— Yin Chuan</p>
<p>The launch of the spiritual mobilization has caused everyone on the isolated island to have a fierce reflection! Based on conscience and in accordance with the outline, let's take the following self-test first! (1) Is my current life proper and meaningful or is it drunken and dreamy? Am I indulging in gambling dens and dance halls? (2) Am I living in a daze? Do I have the belief of "resistance to the end" and "victory in resistance and success in nation-building," and a vigorous and optimistic spirit? (3) Do I want to live such a peaceful life forever, and live on the isolated island forever? Or will I dedicate everything immediately when there is an opportunity, or when the country needs us? (4) Have I forgotten the interests of the country and the nation? Have I done anything that betrays our sovereignty and humiliates the nation, and undermines the national strength? (5) Have I ever thought that I am a citizen of the Chinese nation? The citizens of the Chinese nation firmly believe in justice and righteousness, and fight to kill and destroy the moths that destroy human civilization and well-being, and strive for the revival of the nation. Absolutely obey the command of the supreme leader, and support the national united front: Have the absurd theories of those Trotskyite traitors and Wang's rebellious remnants shaken me?</p>
<p>The National Spiritual Mobilization will begin on May 1st. After we have taken the self-conscience test, we will take an oath based on our conscience and sign the oath. From then on, these few words will be engraved in our hearts and minds every day and every moment: the country is supreme, the nation is supreme; military affairs are first, victory is first; will is concentrated, power is concentrated. At the same time, ask yourself: Have I violated the public conscience of the people? Am I following the oath?</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Speculation Concentrated on Public Bonds, Cash Fluctuations Minimal</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for gold was sluggish, with no excitement. Prices hovered around 2,070 yuan throughout the day. This was because operators saw opportunities for speculation in the public bond market, and their interest in cash waned. It was also because they wanted to wait for Hitler's response to Roosevelt's peace proposal before deciding on a strategy. Therefore, transactions were lackluster. However, a certain gold firm resumed absorbing more than 300 taels on behalf of the Xiamen gang, but gold firms, silver shops, and money changers were still selling actively, so the price increase was minimal. As a result, the price only rose by 3.5 yuan. It was heard that there was potential weakness after the market closed, and that a certain money changer was willing to sell at 2,071 yuan. Transactions were not heavy throughout the day, about 400 taels. Gold ornaments in silver shops did not move. Customs gold, Sino-British pure gold, etc., also did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Spot Price Rose 3.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar of ten taels was initially quite quiet due to scarce supply and demand. Until around ten o'clock, a certain gold firm suddenly absorbed heavily on behalf of the Xiamen gang. Fortunately, local customers have been less interested in gold reserves recently, so the supply intention was still strong, and the process did not change much. A certain gold firm first entered 50 taels from the same industry at 2,070 yuan, which was the opening price, one yuan higher than the previous closing price. After opening, a certain gold firm entered another 50 taels from silver shops and gold firms at the same price. Then, it entered another 100 taels from a certain money changer. The arbitrage price was still 70 yuan. Later, cash firms also entered 50 taels from gold firms at 71 yuan. It was already around eleven o'clock. After that, a certain gold firm entered another 50 taels from a money changer at 72 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, supply and demand were even scarcer, so the situation was quite stable and transactions became clearer. Only a certain gold firm entered 50 taels from a money changer at 72.5 yuan. After that, money changers still wanted to sell, but the gold firm had no appetite. It was delayed until after four o'clock when a certain money changer was heard to be willing to sell at 71 yuan, but those who wanted to buy were still waiting and watching, so no transaction was made. Therefore, the evening closing price was still 2,072.5 yuan. As a result, it rose by 3.5 yuan compared to the noon closing price the day before. The difference throughout the day was only 2.5 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's own brand of gold was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no transactions were made.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments in Silver Shops Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of gold ornaments in silver shops was not changed because the fluctuations in spot gold were quite stable. Da Tonghang still hung 210 yuan, Xin Tonghang 208 yuan, and the buying price was 202 yuan.</p>

In the local black market, the situation was quite stable. Although foreign firms settled spot English and American gold in bulk, and the May American exchange and the Japanese bank entrusted the English bank to settle spot English gold with favorable tracking, the British and American banking communities were still willing to supply, so the result was still flat and transactions were still strong. As for the Hong Kong exchange, there was little change because the buying and selling forces on both sides were evenly matched, and the result was also flat.</p>

The foreign firm settled the HSBC British exchange at 8 pence, 25. HSBC's listing announcement did not move, and the silver balance tax announcement also did not rise or fall, remaining at 5.25 percent. After that, although the foreign bank helped the Japanese bank to buy English gold in bulk, and foreign firms followed and settled American exchange, the British and American banking communities still had a strong willingness to supply, so the situation was still stable. The foreign bank bought the Huabi English exchange at 8 pence, 25. Then, the foreign firm bought the American exchange of a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Near noon, transactions became scarce, while the Hong Kong exchange slightly opened. The foreign firm absorbed the Hong Kong exchange of Anta at 56 yuan, and the potential situation was also unchanged. The bank's selling price at noon was the same as in the morning.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms had no spot settlements, so the market was even more sluggish. There was slightly more buying of forward American exchange, but foreign banks also had a strong willingness to supply, so the situation was quite flat. Foreign firms settled the May American exchange of foreign banks at 16 yuan. The bank's final price in the evening was 8 pence, 25 for English exchange, 16.625 yuan for American exchange, and 56 yuan for Hong Kong exchange.

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Fluctuates Unpredictably</h3>
<p>Yesterday's security black market was characterized by constantly changing news, causing prices to fluctuate accordingly. After rising sharply once, they immediately fell downstream, with unpredictable ups and downs and frequent fluctuations. It can be seen that people are still dazed, and in this environment of large ins and outs, they are easily dominated by environmental news, and those who float with the market are raised or suppressed without doing anything but speculation in order to achieve their wish to grab profits. They are also taking advantage of the ambiguous timing of the news. If there are no changes in the environment, the price should temporarily hover. Yesterday's trend was almost the same as the previous two days in the morning. Initially, there was a sharp rise, followed by a sharp fall, and then a slight tightening at the close. Various firms entered and exited frequently. Tianshenghao entered first and then exited. Datong Lianhe, Deheng Fuyu, and Shuikang all had demand. No. 42 also absorbed a considerable amount, but Nos. 11, 14, and 20, etc., had a strong selling pressure. Dafeng Tongkang, etc., also made disposals, and the market gradually turned tired, slightly smaller than the previous day by 3 to 5 jiao. In the afternoon, the situation was relatively stable, but transactions were cleared, and the market closed very early. Both buyers and sellers were not enthusiastic. As a result, the price was slightly smaller by 3 jiao to 4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was approximately 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Market: 50 shares were traded on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange at a price of 29.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Industrial Institute Stock Market: There was not much activity. Although most stocks had demand, sellers had to wait for a higher price before they were willing to sell. There is currently a lot of bad debt. During this unstable situation, rice dares to circulate in the market. Once the political situation is stable, it will be invested in stocks. Jardine Matheson stocks have demand throughout the day. At the close, the actual price was 20.02 yuan, and the selling price was 20.03 yuan. Jardine Matheson price was 35.25 yuan, Tramway stock price was 40 yuan, and Public Bus stock price was 26.25 yuan (excluding interest of 7 jiao).

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: After the Chaoshan Gang Stopped Shipping, Spot Yarn Once Plunged, But Eventually Maintained, and All Yarn Selling Prices Reversed and Rose Because the Bulls Rose Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a swirling state, but the actual transaction is becoming sluggish and weak. Rumors spread in the market that the Chaoshan gang had stopped loading and shipping, saying that the situation there was slightly tight. As a result, the gang only packed but did not ship in the foremarket, causing some people to become slack. However, after the writer received this news, I conducted a detailed investigation. According to news from a certain cotton industry organization, the goods shipped to the place were strictly inspected by the authorities, and it was found that there were many shoddy cotton textiles mixed with fish eyes and pearls. Therefore, the authorities instructed merchants to register and approve the name of the goods before they were allowed to be imported. Therefore, the telegram temporarily buys goods, and must wait for the procedures to be completed before loading the goods. The market was slightly affected and flat in the morning, and turned lively again in the afternoon. It is said that Japanese yarn is soaring and Chinese yarn is cheaper. Buyers rose again and moved forward.</p>
<p>Spot yarn situation, the initial opening in the morning, a part of the news that the Min gang did not handle the goods, the market gas loose, the opening price suddenly fell by two yuan, 20 count double horse price of 400 yuan, stack price of 395 and a half yuan, the market sales mediocre, then Japanese yarn price Ang, a certain cloth factory into 20 count golden tiger 350 bags, the people shake, the market situation turned Ang, slowly rebounded, 20 count double horse price of 401 and a half yuan to 2 yuan, with the previous day's price flat, the latter market opening in the middle of 20 count yarn because of the collapse of households activities, the market situation rose by two or three yuan, 20 count five-fold shepherd force is strong, 20 count double horse price of 402 and a half yuan, Shantou gang did not have a transaction from beginning to end, check the full day of each gang bought a total of 1990 bags, the market of 20 count double horse rose 5 jiao, the Shepherd Five Blessing rose 2.3 yuan, 10 count coarse yarn transactions turned less, the price of flat, 32 count and 42 count also no up and down, the factory opened 20 count Dafang 200 bags, the price of 390 bags, May to August Litai factory, opened 15 count Sleeping Lion 50 bags, the price of 347 yuan, today there are 550 pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Tianjin, 55 pieces shipped to Yantai, now record the amount of each gang bought to the left,</p>
<h3>Why Do British and Japanese Yarn Rise? The Rise of British Yarn is a Natural Trend, and the Rise of Japanese Yarn is a Trick of Treacherous Merchants</h3>
<p>British yarn 20 count five blessing shepherd yesterday's sales suddenly became active, at the same time the selling price also tended to rise, in fact, because its price is cheaper, it caused the attention of the general hoarding households, check its past and 20 count double horse yarn price difference, compared as follows,</p>
<p>(1) This year's red plate opening price, 20 count double horse spot yarn price of 403 yuan, Shepherd price of 382 yuan, the current double horse spot yarn price rose to 402 yuan, the comparison is only small one yuan, Shepherd spot yarn price of 362 yuan, the comparison wants to fall 20 yuan or so,</p>
<p>(2) According to this situation, the difference between the two sides is too far away, today other yarn soars, in fact, thinking, British yarn is cheaper, so it caused the buyers in the market to search, in the afternoon, it stimulated the rise of more than three yuan, 20 count Shepherd price of 365 and a half yuan, five blessing price of 357 yuan to eight yuan,</p>
<p>Japanese yarn market, recently heard step by step up, and yesterday's rise is more sharp, and now the tense situation, said there is a squeeze wind, check its inside situation, very complex, most reasons, said the Yangtze River all the way needs more improvement, but Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces guerrilla area, recently guerrilla warfare is more intense, Japanese yarn sales stagnation, so the general situation is so, for the next month's air strike intention is strong, Unexpectedly, the amount of throwing increased, which caused the other party to care, from this, the multi-party contact with a party, will be the Japanese yarn quota closed and not open, the market is shouting spot shortage, as for this month, the time is approaching, the amount of air strike no place to call to compensate, the situation is tight, it is a squeeze sound, if you say its squeeze, and the facts feel that the father does not match, because this month 20 count blue Phoenix yarn price to do 366 yuan, the next month that is, May to do 372 yuan, compared to the previous month's price rose five or six yuan,</p>
<p>From the line of the test, is still a small this month and the next month, check the market past situation of the view, is not like a squeeze, should be this month's rise is particularly high, over the next month's price, just in line with the reason, the reason for this, I am afraid that outsiders do not know the truth, played a what trick, in short, for this transaction, cautious for the best policy also (A)</p>
<h3>American Loaned Cotton Allowed to be Redeemed; Indian Cotton Steadily Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, influenced by the initial drop in New York cotton prices due to Liverpool's telegram and domestic and international settlements, saw a wait-and-see approach from the general industry. The Washington side's export subsidy rumors remain uncertain, but these rumors still have great potential influence. The US government's Cotton Loan Administration announced yesterday that those who made cotton loans in 1937 could redeem them by paying the original loan amount plus interest and storage fees. With these funds, they could retrieve the government's loaned cotton from that year. According to this rule, all grades of American cotton can be purchased at will. (The 1937 loaned cotton totaled 5,192,020 bales, with a total weight of 2,669,850,400 pounds). Yesterday, New York prices fell by the pound, while Indian cotton, along with forecasts, rose by two rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by over ten pounds. Converted to legal currency, American and Brazilian cotton fell by three jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by six jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by five jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade previously suffered from extremely low shipping fees due to excessive Indian cotton orders. After extensive efforts from all parties, shipping companies have already chartered five ships to transport Indian cotton. Therefore, the daily arrivals are still numerous, leading factories to become more relaxed about purchasing raw cotton. However, it is generally expected that if yarn prices rise sharply or foreign cotton prices plummet, factories will place large orders. Below are the converted factory prices of yesterday's cotton market:</p>
<p>Indian cotton continues to be imported. The Italian ship Arabia, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, is carrying 3,625 bales of cotton from Karachi, India, and will unload at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong.</p>
<p>The business of local cotton has shown improvement. Chinese factories are increasingly interested in the pure white color of local cotton, fully adopting it due to its attractive qualities, and it can be mixed with Indian cotton. However, Indian cotton remains the main component, with local cotton only used for blending, so the quantity is not significant, and transactions are not active. However, the selling price remains firm and high. In reality, there is nothing remarkable to report, and the future situation lacks certainty. It is likely to remain in a state of dilemma. Supply from northern Jiangsu has been interrupted. Below is a record of the current cotton situation:</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea; Japanese and American Silk Prices Plummet; Shanghai Factories’ Foreign Sales Stagnate; Tussah Silk Demand from India and Africa Turns Active</h3>
<p>Although overseas silk markets saw mixed gains and losses yesterday, major markets such as New York in the US and Yokohama in Japan uniformly plummeted. New York’s near-term prices plunged by 1.05 cents, equivalent to a drop of about 80 yuan in legal currency per dan, while long-term prices fell by 8 cents. Japanese silk prices fell by 4 cents, and Shanghai silk prices fell by 1 cent. Yokohama’s spot prices fell by 30 yuan, and long-term prices fell by 10 yuan. Only Lyon saw an increase across the board, mainly because the Lyon silk market always follows the lead of Japanese and American silk prices, and its fluctuations are not as flexible as the latter. Lyon's upward trend yesterday may have been due to the influence of the previous gains in Japan and the US. The price of silk in Lyon saw Japanese silk rise by three francs, Shanghai A-grade silk rose by five francs, and B-grade silk rose by 3.50 francs.</p>
<p>Shanghai's silk market saw sluggish sales of white filature silk yesterday. Trading houses' buying prices fell by 50-70 yuan compared to the previous day. Manufacturers considered themselves lucky to have sold at good prices the day before. However, considering that domestic inventory is low and the price of Chinese and Japanese raw silk can still be guaranteed at a relatively high level, the basic conditions have not changed, so sentiment remains optimistic. Therefore, trading houses have stopped selling white filature silk. Moreover, sales of silk to India and Africa have been quiet for a long time, and the recent rise in Chinese and foreign silk markets has also deeply stimulated demand. As a result, white trading houses such as Samsung and Great America actively traded tussah silk yesterday, selling lower-grade tussah silk at 830 yuan, an increase of about 30 yuan, with a total of 40 dan transacted. In addition, gray silk also had orders yesterday, with chemical silk priced at 805 yuan, with 30 dan transacted. Market conditions were more firm than before.</p>
<h3>New Tea Season Begins; Tea Merchants Flock to Production Areas to Procure</h3>
<p>This year's new tea season has arrived. The Trade Commission continues to strengthen its control mechanism for red and green boxed tea from various provinces, establishing purchasing agencies in various production areas to carry out full purchases and stipulating new transportation routes to facilitate transfer to Hong Kong for concentration. The China Tea Company will continue to sign new tea sales contracts with the Soviet Union, continuing last year's priority tea sales rights. Therefore, it is expected that this year's Chinese tea trade will be even better. As for the domestic sales of raw tea and store tea, they must be approved by the Trade Commission and complete foreign exchange settlement procedures before they can be re-exported. Therefore, members of the tea associations operating foreign tea companies in Shanghai, apart from a part that has already gone to various production areas to set up factories for on-site processing and has established sales offices in Hong Kong to handle business negotiations and sales, another part has changed to setting up local tea factories. Recently, they have sent watermen to Ningbo, Wenzhou, and the Huzhou area in the guerrilla zone to prepare to procure new tea, and there are also many new brands being actively prepared. Once the new goods arrive, they can be quickly made into boxes and freely traded with foreign firms stationed in Shanghai. Therefore, the foreign market in Shanghai is still temporarily stagnant. However, according to general tea merchants, the mountain price of this year's new tea will definitely be high. Before the prices of new tea in the production area are revealed, if they can calmly observe and not compete to offer prices for procurement, there may be prospects for business; otherwise, optimism is not warranted.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, 25 pieces of tea were shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market; Refined Sugar Futures; Production Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures prices of refined white sugar for September and October new goods, according to reports from the production area, were 8.20 florins (per kilogram), up 0.10 from the previous day. Therefore, the association's pricing became tight again. For the 24th of refined white re-export goods, it was found that the previous day had reached $18.15, and yesterday it rose again to $18.225 to $18.20, with about 600 bags transacted. Spot prices were quoted at $26.25, and our store quoted $26.40. Taikoo refined white sugar did not fluctuate much. The supply from domestic sugar merchants was still scarce. Chaozhou common Huanggang green sugar was $14.80-90, Shantou red sugar was $15, totaling over a hundred bags. Jianzhou miscellaneous Lu Bai Gong sugar, over ninety bags, was quoted at $22.50. On the 20th, 6,000 bags of sugar were imported.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods; Shantou Slows Down; Fujian Merchants Repackage; British Ships; East Piece Goods Market Turns Firm; Domestic Cloth</h3>
<p>Customer transactions have become quieter. Yesterday, Shantou merchants telegraphed that various cloths would be temporarily delayed in shipment. Fujian merchants, considering the needed goods, only loaded them onto British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships to avoid the dangers of the voyage, and their interest in purchasing was also very weak. Parcels destined for Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan are excessively crowded and have stopped being accepted. Although shipping is open, capacity is still insufficient. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased over three thousand pieces of colored, twill, and printed cloth. Transactions on this street were better, with few price fluctuations. White coarse cloth is in tight supply from factories, and sentiment is optimistic. Some industry members and wholesale merchants on this street continue to be healthy in purchasing. Merchants from Zhejiang purchased over a hundred packages, all sold by hoarders. Including 200-odd packages of 11, 13, 14, and 16-pound coarse cloth from Yihe, Dasheng, and Xinyu factories. Industry members made profits by hoarding and then selling out over 200 packages. Fine cloth and fine twill from factories continue to be expensive, and current sales are slightly sluggish. Cheap spot goods in the market are still mostly purchased by industry members. Scattered amounts of thirty to forty packages were purchased from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and fifty to sixty packages were purchased by Guangdong merchants. For dyeing purposes on this street, nearly a hundred pieces were purchased, and sales are slightly firm, at five to ten cents per piece.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the white goods market turned firm due to active customer sales. Tianjin and Qingdao merchants purchased over four hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Dyeing factory industry members on this street also transacted seven to eight hundred pieces. Longtou fine cloth was sold at $13.175, so the overall price of fine cloth increased by about five cents per piece. The fine twill market remained the same, but due to low inventory, it was even more stable than fine cloth.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 22nd, 260 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, and 120 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Food; Flour Sales Sluggish; Flat and Weak as Usual; Factory Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions of local factory flour became even more sluggish. Northern merchants are currently loading over 100,000 bags of spot flour today, and new transactions are trending towards a wait-and-see attitude due to the unclear exchange rates in Tianjin. Southern merchants are also busy loading previous batches of flour, so their interest in purchasing is very quiet. Therefore, the total transactions, apart from small-scale retail on this street, are less than 10,000 bags combined from northern and southern customer sales. Factories believe that even if prices are lowered, it will be difficult to boost sales, so they are superficially maintaining the original price of $4.45. If entire lots are cleared, negotiations are possible. Whether there will be a formal reduction or not will be decided early next week. Today, 27,000 bags are being exported to Tianjin and 4,000 bags to Yantai.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign flour market generally remained stagnant. According to overseas news, due to the dangerous international situation, grain prices are not expected to be low. No one inquired about long-term American and Australian foreign flour due to unclear pricing. Spot foreign flour transactions in the market were also quiet. It is said that customers have returned previously purchased foreign flour, but holders are still unwilling to lower prices due to the high overseas pricing and related costs. Mid-range high-brand prices are above $4.20, and the next level is $4.15, all priced in cash. Entire lot transactions have stopped, with only small-scale sales of a few thousand bags, all retailed on this street.</p>
<h3>Stored Rice Prevents Steaming; Most Owners Willing to Sell</h3>
<p>Du Geng Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, sources from all regions downstream had not arrived. 1,700-1,800 bags of Shanghai Suzhou Tong region rice, and 500 bags of Kunshan rice have arrived. Sales on this street continued to be stagnant, and hoarders have mostly stopped buying, because the weather is humid and steaming, and their moods are troubled. Moreover, warehouse storage is abundant, and they fear that if the quality of the rice changes one day, there will be an immediate rush to sell, leading to this phenomenon. The sellers' moods depend on the quantity of their inventory, and they are devising plans to sell. Therefore, the market outcome yesterday was that thick glutinous rice prices fell by a few cents to one jiao, while thin high-grade rice owners, knowing their own costs are heavy and that inland transportation is temporarily blocked, are unwilling to sell lightly, so although there are few transactions, prices fluctuate greatly. Other downstream goods rely on scarcity to stay put. Du Yangbu sharp rice sources are rare, and warehouse stock is decreasing daily, so it is very different from the glutinous rice market. Yesterday, a fixed situation appeared, and the path to variable elements has been stagnant for a long time. Now it is being lowered from the glutinous rice market, making it even harder to find a foothold.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales were more lively due to low prices. The number of transactions for the whole day increased to slightly over 2,000 bags. However, supply continued to flow in an endless stream. Yesterday, over 3,000 bags were delivered by the car wheel. Therefore, high and medium grades saw another reduction of one jiao. However, in the afternoon, as digestion turned active, the downward trend gradually subsided. If today's sales continue unabated, the market may stabilize.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods; Dried Longan Meat Weak and Unable to Recover</h3>
<p>Shima sun-dried longan meat, due to the continuous arrival of goods and supply exceeding demand, is in an extremely weak market. The goods that arrived before and after the holiday have not been sold. However, calculating the production price, it is about ten yuan cheaper than in Shanghai, suggesting that the future market will have to be sold cheaply.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports; Many Goods from Holland</h3>
<p>It was found that the previous day's imports included 1,010 pieces of rubber, 3,000 bags of coconut shells (soap raw material), 500 pieces of coconut oil, 640 boxes of tires, and 120 pieces of kapok, all shipped from Holland to Shanghai. Yesterday, 190 bags of beans were shipped from Tianjin, and 3,400 pieces of fresh eggs were shipped from Xingang.</p>

<p>Transportation and Traffic Weekly</p>
<h3>Taking the Route from Kunming via Annam to Singapore</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's transportation network has become increasingly dense, and with the rise of the War of Resistance, inland transportation has become more developed. The situation of domestic transportation has been recorded in this journal many times, but there have been few reports on the transportation situation between foreign countries and our inland. Those who want to go to Europe from our country all take a postal ship from Shanghai or Hong Kong. Even to go to Singapore in the British Malay Peninsula, most people take a ship. Now, the southwestern provinces have become the center of gathering for the people of our country, and Kunming and Guiyang have become important routes for going inland. If traffic is taken from ports in Shanghai, it will not only be unsuitable in terms of time and economy, but also the journey will be hard. Now, the route and itinerary from Kunming to Singapore via Annam is explored and described below, which may be considered by readers as a shortcut from the mainland to foreign countries, and attention should be paid to it.</p>
<p>From Kunming to Hanoi, there is the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway train, which runs every day and has many trips. The last issue of this journal had a publication of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway timetable, which will not be repeated here. After arriving in Hanoi, change to a French national railway train to Saigon, which takes two days, with express trains running every day. After arriving in Saigon, take a five-hour road bus to Anko in Annam, and then proceed to the border between Annam and Siam. You can take the Pin-Siam Railway train to Penang, then take the Star-Pin joint train directly to Singapore. The journey from Bangkok to Singapore takes three days, and the fare is 83.19 ringgit for first class, 41.49 ringgit for second class, and 23.54 ringgit for third class. In total, it only takes seven days from Kunming to Singapore, which is much more convenient than transferring through Hong Kong and Shanghai. Also, air travel between Singapore and Kunming can also be connected. The itinerary and fares are also attached for reference:</p>
<p>Dutch planes take off from Singapore every Tuesday and Sunday at 12 noon and arrive in Saigon at 4:40 pm on the same afternoon. The fare is 129 ringgit. From Saigon to Hanoi, there are French planes that take off from Saigon at 7:00 am every Wednesday and arrive in Hanoi at 11:00 am on the same morning. The Cai price is 1,800 francs. After arriving in Hanoi, there are China National Aviation Corporation planes that fly to Kunming every Wednesday and Friday, which can be reached in three hours. The fare is 95 Vietnamese currency. In this way, the voyage between Star and Yunnan only takes a few days.</p>
<h3>Detailed Records of Inland Highways (II)</h3>
<p>— Jingxun</p>
<p>Guiyang to Chongqing (Haitangxi)</p>
<p>This section of the highway is the northern section of the trunk line of the Southwest Highway; the entire journey is 488 kilometers long, and passenger cars can reach more than half of it. However, Guiyang is the central point of various roads, and there are many passengers going to Chongqing from here. Although there are four passenger cars running back and forth every day on this road, it is not easy to buy a ticket. Therefore, passengers must register in advance. You can register at the station or the China Travel Service. When you are lucky, you can get a seat in one or two days; otherwise, it will probably take one or two weeks. The food and accommodation situation along the way is as follows:</p>
<p>On the first day, leave Guiyang to Tongzi. This section is 221 kilometers long. Depart from Guiyang at 7:00 in the morning and arrive at Wujiang Ferry at noon. The car must cross the river here. The water of Wujiang flows very fast, and it takes a lot of time to cross the river. Passengers can use this time to eat here. The Highway Bureau entrusted China Travel Service to set up a special Wujiang Canteen here, which costs three jiao per meal, and the taste is quite good. From Wujiang Ferry to Tongzi, it only takes a few hours. Tongzi has a Tongzi Hostel run by China Travel Service. The equipment is clean and hygienic. There are separate rooms and dormitory rooms upstairs and downstairs, and the price ranges from one yuan to three yuan five jiao. On the second day, from Tongzi to Qijiang, this section is 183 kilometers long. Depart from Tongzi in the morning. You have to pass through dangerous areas such as Liangfengya, Gou Si Cliff, and Jiulong Mountain. This section of mountain road is rugged, with high mountains on one side and deep valleys on the other, which is very dangerous. Passengers should get off the car and walk for a while to be safer. Lunch is at Songkan at noon, and arrive at Qijiang in the evening. The Qijiang Hostel is under preparation, and only a special hostel, Yingbin Hotel, can be temporarily stayed in. Passengers should bring their own bedding. On the third day, from Qijiang to Haitangxi, this section is only 84 kilometers long, and the car can reach it in three hours. Cross the Yangtze River from here, and you will be in Military Celebration. The ferry runs back and forth three or four times an hour, which takes about ten minutes. Each person on the highway can carry 20 kilograms of free luggage, and the charge for excessive luggage is 1 yuan, 9 jiao, 8 fen, and 6 li per 5 kilograms. (The journey from Military Celebration to Guiyang is the opposite, but the departure time of the highway car from Haitangxi is 1:00 pm.)</p>
<p>Guiyang to Liuzhou This section is the southern section of the Southwest Highway trunk line, with a total length of 632 kilometers, and highway cars can reach it in three days. There are not as many passengers on this section of the highway as there are on the northern and western sections, so it is easier to buy tickets. The food and accommodation situation along the way is as follows:</p>
<p>On the first day, from Guiyang to Dushan, the entire journey is 230 kilometers long, and it takes about 10 hours to travel. Have lunch at Ma Changping in the middle of the journey. This place is the meeting station for the east line and the south line of the Southwest Highway, and the dishes are very delicious. Stay at Dushan in the evening. Dushan has a special hostel - Xie An Hotel, which costs six jiao for one night and two meals. There are ten improved beds, each costing nine jiao. On the second day, from Dushan to Hechi, this section is 181 kilometers long, and it takes about 8 hours to travel. Have lunch at Liuzhai or Nandan in the middle of the journey. This section of the highway has a very rugged and bad road surface. Stay at Hechi in the evening. The China Travel Service Hechi Hostel is located on Fenghuangyi Street, only half a mile from the station. The equipment and meals are good, and it can accommodate more than 40 passengers. The room fee ranges from five jiao to two yuan, and the meals are divided into three types: five jiao, three jiao, and two jiao. On the third day, from Hechi to Liuzhou, the distance is 221 kilometers, and the car takes about 8 hours to reach. Have lunch in Yishan in the middle of the journey, and you can arrive in Liuzhou at about 5:00 pm. Each person is allowed to carry 20 kilograms of free luggage, and the charge for excessive luggage is 1 yuan, 8 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li per 5 kilograms. (The journey from Liuzhou to Guiyang is the opposite.)—To be continued—</p>

<p>Travel Tips</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of Taking a Steamboat</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Choosing an outer cabin is certainly better for air circulation, but in the event of wind and waves, the outer cabin will be much more turbulent than the inner cabin. If you are not afraid of seasickness, by all means, choose an outer cabin. If you are prone to seasickness, an inner cabin is better.</p>
<p>When seasickness strikes, eating two salted olives is more effective than seasickness medication.</p>
<p>When the boat has just docked, everyone is eager to rush ashore. At this time, luggage is most easily stolen. It is best to remain calm and not be hasty.</p>
<p>If you want the ship's steward to help you more and are prepared to tip him generously, then you should give him the tip as soon as you board the ship. If you can satisfy his desires, you will benefit greatly throughout the journey. Otherwise, if he is unsure of your generosity, he will not be very helpful.</p>
<p>When encountering rooms with bunk beds, the lower bunk is, of course, better than the upper bunk.</p>
<p>Some ships' blankets are not very clean. If you are not used to using them, it is best to bring a bed sheet to wrap yourself in.</p>
<p>If you are traveling with family and do not want to eat in the dining room, please ask the steward to have the meals brought to your room. This service is available on the ship and does not require extra money.</p>
<p>When the ship docks mid-journey to load cargo or disembark passengers, it is best to close the windows on the side facing the walkway, as it is easiest for theft to occur if you leave the room or are sleeping.</p>
<p>Sometimes the steward will try to get you to gamble with strangers. If you are not an experienced gambler, it is best to decline. Also, be especially careful when talking to strangers who strike up a conversation, and do not speak carelessly.</p>
<h3>1939 Nash Car: Overview of Advantages</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Nash cars, known for their solid construction, powerful engines, beautiful styling, and luxurious interiors, are famous throughout the world. The 1939 model features even more astounding new advances. As the new Nash is scheduled to arrive in port on the 23rd of this month, here is a brief description of its most prominent features:</p>
<p>Climate Control System: When the 1938 Nash car was introduced, it caused a sensation in the automotive industry due to its new ventilation system, which regulated the air to keep the car warm in winter. The comfort was no different from being at home. Now, this invention has been researched and improved several times, and its function is even more remarkable, as it has become a fully automatic climate control system. The device is dial-type and is installed under the dashboard. With a simple turn, the temperature inside the car can be adjusted to your liking, providing warmth in winter and coolness in summer, making you feel extremely comfortable. Once you have adjusted to the temperature you need, it can be maintained regardless of the weather, wind direction, or vehicle speed. In the summer, the air inside the car is smooth and very cool, and the car windows can be closed tightly to avoid the intrusion of wind, rain, dust, or insects.</p>
<p>Abundant Power: The engine of the new Nash is very different from other engines. For example, ordinary intake pipes are exposed to the outside without protection, causing the gasoline inside to be filled with gaseous compounds, and the engine cannot generate maximum function consistently. However, this is not the case with the new Nash. Its intake pipe is tightly wrapped inside the engine, so each cylinder always has the same temperature, and the influence of gaseous compounds is minimal. All of this is closely related to the engine's high performance. The new Nash engine uses a dual ignition system, has a whirlwind-like power, is full of power, and the action is sensitive, which has never been possible before. With just a light touch of the toe, it can change from slowly moving forward to speeding like flying.</p>
<p>Easy Shifting: Shifting in the new Nash car is extremely easy. Its new shifting device is installed on the steering column, just below the steering wheel. Its operation method is the same as the old-style shifting lever, but it is much more convenient. The driver's hands do not even need to leave the steering wheel, and they can still shift quickly, accurately, and naturally. Because the shifting lever no longer exists, there is no obstacle in the foot area, which makes it feel more spacious. Naturally, it is easier to handle in the driver's seat. Furthermore, because the new Nash car is equipped with a new automatic fourth gear, the engine speed can be reduced by 30% at 40 miles per hour, so it will not be damaged due to excessive speed, and the car will safely fly by. As for fuel, it can be saved by 25%, and oil can be saved by 50%.</p>
<p>Safe and Comfortable: The entire mechanism of the new Nash car is extremely precise, meticulous, and superior, so it is extremely stable and comfortable no matter what speed you drive on any road. The all-steel structure of the car body, the flexible use of the carburetor, the easy and accurate shifting, and the easy handling of the steering are all important factors in the absolute safety and reliability of the new Nash car.</p>
<p>The new Nash car has so many advantages, and its style, luxury, equipment, and internal space are all at their peak. Therefore, it is no surprise that it meets the needs of people in the automotive industry and wins a warm welcome. Nash cars are managed by Datong Automobile Company at No. 1460 Jing'an Temple Road in this port. The company is actively renovating and arranging, and will officially open soon.</p>

<h3>The Group of Suicides in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th: According to statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, in 1938, the number of suicides in Tokyo reached 1,498, and the number of attempted suicides was 386, totaling 1,884 people. This group of suicides is limited to just one corner of Tokyo. If we take statistics from all over Japan, we don't know how many or even dozens of "1,884 people" there will be.</p>
<p>The reasons for these suicides have not been announced by the police department, so we have no way of knowing them, but we can guess at one or two of them. Since Japan invaded China, it has completely regarded itself as a victorious nation. Therefore, its people should be thriving and afraid of death, so as to enjoy the happiness of a victorious nation. They are too busy seeking life, let alone seeking death? When people do not want to live and commit suicide, what is the pain in their hearts like?</p>
<p>What people want is only peace and prosperity. Wars of aggression are always opposed by the people. Since the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese people have been forced to go to the front lines by the warlords. I don't know how many of them suffered. I also don't know how many fathers, brothers, sons, friends, and relatives died in the hail of bullets! Good family children, good family fathers and brothers, good family relatives and friends were forced by the warlords to become soldiers, go to the front lines, and fill the artillery fire. They came alive, and went back as dead ashes. Where did they come from? Even women, children who are not yet adults, and the old and weak who are unable to walk, who have not been forced to go to the front lines, live difficult lives in the country, with low wages, high prices, and the collapse of small and medium-sized industries. They are restricted from consuming and burdened more heavily. They feel pain both materially and spiritually. These days are indeed difficult to live. Instead of living miserably, it is better to die. It is better to commit suicide and end this life. It is no wonder that there are so many suicides.</p>
<p>I also heard that the Japanese troops stationed in the occupied areas of our country cried loudly or committed suicide with each other when they heard the news of being transferred to the front lines. I don't know how many or even dozens of "1,884 people" there are? I feel deeply sad for the Japanese people who died in this way, and I am even more afraid for the Japanese warlords. In short, this situation is nothing more than a gift from the Japanese warlords, driving millions of strong men into artillery fire and bombs to fill their personal desires. They want to kill people, but first commit suicide. This is governed by the law of cause and effect, and no one can escape it. I ask, why did the group of suicides die?</p>
<p>A Corner of Society</p>
<h3>A Home in a Car</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Walking east along Haifang Road, crossing Gordon Road, there is a section of dirt road that has not been successfully opened. On rainy days, it is very muddy and difficult to walk on. There is not even a small stone in the middle. On both sides are low tile or thatched houses, which are either relics of former towns or newly built shelters, gathering a group of people who shed blood and sweat, struggling on the poverty line every day.</p>
<p>At the bend of the road, there is a car parked in the distance, but when you run closer, you can't help but smile. Ah! It's a dilapidated car shell!</p>
<p>The green paint on the outside of the car has not been completely eroded. There are no glass tires. The windows are covered with Shenbao newspapers. Inside, there is a pile of rags and straw mats—all of their belongings. Outside the car, against the wall, is the place to sit, cook, and eat. The car is the bedroom. It's okay on sunny days, but on rainy days, they can only move to the eaves far away to hide, cook two meals of meager porridge to fill their stomachs, and mend the few pieces of clothing they have. When it gets dark, they crawl into the car. They don't have the strength to buy a piece of cloth. If they had a piece of cloth, the children would have no clothes. Relying on the money the man earns from pulling a rickshaw, a family of five maintains their life.</p>
<p>The scene of their hometown and the experience of fleeing are always in their minds. Every time the flag of the West Side Yarn Factory is raised, they have to scold it once. Besides that, what other grievances and fantasies do they have? Cold is something they cannot hope to avoid because they are poor. They should be so lucky. Aren't many of their neighbors spending the night in places without roofs?</p>
<h3>The Flower Girl</h3>
<p>— Yanhua</p>
<p>"Pygmalion"</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, screening at Cathay Theatre</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao is a well-known humor master in Shanghai. He visited Shanghai in 1933. This "Flower Girl" is a stage play he wrote in 1912. It was staged in 1913 and was warmly welcomed. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925. This time, although the Hollywood Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave the "Flower Girl" script the highest award, he refused to accept it. Mr. Xiao believes that Hollywood film companies only know how to make money, so he never wanted to give his scripts to American film companies to make films. Although the "Flower Girl" was filmed by MGM this time, Mr. Xiao made a point that all the actors must be British, and MGM went to England to film it for the sake of serious filming.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Xiao's works and thoughts, the Chinese publishing industry has already introduced a lot, so we don't think it is necessary to repeat it. Mr. Lin Yutang translated this "Flower Girl" for "Kaiming" very early, but it is no longer available for purchase.</p>
<p>However, judging from the results of this "Flower Girl," it is indeed a rare literary film in recent years. The entire film, in addition to immersing the audience in satirical and humorous dialogues, also has a very excellent script compilation, such as: (1) Writing about Professor Higgins, a phonetics professor, teaching the flower girl the language for six months, the techniques he uses are very concise, only cutting out each fragment of the teaching process to write how the flower girl is learning; (2) During the second experiment period of the flower girl, a certain young man came to ask about the flower girl several times. The script only mentioned that the maid wanted to see the flower girl, but never let him appear on the stage, until the flower girl came out of Higgins' house and said she was going to get married, and then, from Higgins' eyes, she saw the flower girl getting into a certain young man's car. Here, the young man's appearance is introduced; (3) Writing about the flower girl's inner pain, after returning from participating in the ambassador's banquet, she only heard Higgins and a certain general laughing, while the flower girl painfully lay on the chair and shed tears; here, Higgins et al.'s indifference contrasts with the flower girl's self-awareness and her hatred for Higgins et al. This kind of psychological description is touching enough and profound.</p>
<p>In addition to Lees Howard himself, Antoni Asku also directed this film. Judging from the performance standards and the techniques used by the director, "Flower Girl" has indeed reached an excellent level. We might as well give a few examples: (1) After the flower girl's training was completed, she ran out of the house, wearing a noblewoman's clothes, and returned to her old, dirty street. A flower seller was surprised and wanted to call her name, but immediately retracted. She handed her a flower, and she took out money from her wallet to give her. The gray street and the flower girl immediately contrasted strongly with her current life; (2) When the flower woman was led into the bathroom to take a bath, we only saw that she refused to take off her clothes, and it was not until she was pulled into the bathtub that the flower woman shouted loudly. The camera slid from the corridor to the downstairs, and Higgins and a certain general were looking up and listening to the flower girl's cry. Here, the sound introduced that Higgins had been standing downstairs for a long time; (3) In the training process of teaching the flower girl to pronounce, the director used various angles to capture Higgins' posture when he was teaching in the flower girl's dream, recalling the daytime teaching situation. It gave people a very clear and provocative impression.</p>
<p>In the process of weaving all the scenes and describing the emotional atmosphere, we can see the excellence and success of the director's handling of the entire film.</p>
<p>The two main characters, Benslian Zhaihua and Wenda Xila, both played very successfully, and Wenda Xila's acting skills were even more touching and delicate.</p>
<p>This is a successful literary film. Those who love Mr. Xiao's works and film art should go and appreciate this film.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Art Circle Charity Sale to Rescue Refugees</h3>
<p>— Yongwo</p>
<p>Exhibition to be held at the Great Sun Company starting next month</p>
<p>Two hundred artists participating, collecting 2,000 works</p>
<p>Since our country launched a full-scale war, it has been twenty-one months, and we have always used a long-term and sustained war to exhaust the opponent's combat power and obtain the final victory. However, the number of refugees is increasing day by day, and the painful lives are extended day by day. Everyone who sees it seems to feel uneasy, but these are also facts that we expected. In order to fight for the survival of the entire country, the loss of private property is naturally not worth mentioning. However, their current temporary lives have to depend on the relief of local philanthropists to continue.</p>
<p>In today's isolated island, most of the refugees are living in refugee camps. Although they can barely get food to eat and clothes to wear, they also need to be educated and engage in production, so that the refugees can have knowledge and skills, everyone can produce, and everyone can be self-reliant, and not rely on others to live. The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Art Writers Association, in view of this, in order to contribute the strength of its colleagues and seek the future happiness of the refugees on the isolated island, will hold an exhibition of "Shanghai Art Circle Charity Sale to Rescue Refugees". There are two ways to provide relief: Category A, all donations except expenses will be donated to refugees to be used as education and production funds; Category B, half of the donations except expenses will be donated to refugees, and half will be returned to the producers. In order to understand the contents of the association's preparations, the author made a visit to the association's office yesterday afternoon, and the standing committee members Gu Tingwang and Wu Chang accompanied the conversation. The points obtained are recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding this exhibition with great significance, the association has been prepared and will be held in the exhibition hall on the fourth floor of the Great Sun Company on Nanjing Road starting on the 12th of next month, for a limited period of ten days. The participating groups include: Du Jinsheng Velvet Company, Shengsheng Art Company, Liming Industrial Company, and other major famous groups. The types of exhibitions include: industrial arts, artistic crafts, commercial art, artistic commercial products, as well as Chinese paintings, Western paintings, sculptures, photography, batik, antiques, etc. The number of exhibits is more than 2,000 exquisite works. The participating artists include Wang Yachen, Du Jinsheng, Hang Zhiying, Gu Tingkang, Wu Chang, Sun Xueni, Yan Wenliang, Wang Shouren, Ge Xiangfeng, and more than 200 famous artists.</p>
<p>It is said that the exhibition held by the association has been prepared for a considerable period of time, with a large scope and many types. It brings together the crystallization of various famous artists and gathers precious artistic masterpieces from ancient and modern times. In terms of pricing, we strive to reduce it to promote it. Therefore, this exhibition is indeed an invaluable opportunity for ancient and modern Western art lovers, and it is also a good opportunity to obtain treasures and benefit refugees at the same time, achieving two goals with one move.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Is It Illusion or Reality, Playing a Role; Is It Appropriate to Act or Stop, a Home Everywhere</p>
<p>Jin Danyun came and added a lot of excitement. She had been separated from the He sisters for a few days, and now they were together again. It is said that she was very busy for two days, because she had been in Shanghai a few days ago to host Mrs. Sulia, an American, and then returned to Shanghai. It turned out that Mrs. Sulia's father was originally a wealthy American, and the reason for his wealth was that he started in trade in China. Later, she married Mr. Sulia, and Mr. Sulia was also very willing to invest in China. Unfortunately, Mr. Sulia was injured and died in a plane crash during a sea voyage. However, Mrs. Sulia's father only had one daughter, but no son. All the inheritance, except for a small part donated to public welfare, was mostly returned to his daughter, Mrs. Sulia. Not only that, Mr. Sulia was also a major American businessman. Although his assets were not as high as his father-in-law's, he had assets of more than 10 million US dollars. Moreover, Mr. Sulia also had no son, only one daughter, named Manling, who is still studying at an American university. Therefore, Mrs. Sulia has assets of 40 to 50 million US dollars in her hands. When Mrs. Sulia was young, she followed her father to China. Since she got married, she has never been here. Since Mr. Su passed away, she has also been unwilling to leave her because of her daughter's education. Now that her daughter has grown up, she came to China to travel and invest in China, so she wanted to complete her father's and husband's unfulfilled aspirations. When she arrived in China, many people knew that Mrs. Sulia was a capitalist and tried their best to socialize with her. Everyone wanted to recruit her shares and invite her to invest, but Mrs. Sulia, although she had money, was not sloppy and would consider everything carefully. Among the emerging industries in China now, the most popular is mining. China's wealth is mostly under the ground. Just think about which province does not have several of the richest mines. Whether it is coal mines, iron mines, gold mines, silver mines, copper, tin, lead, zinc, and various other mines, China has all the mines in the world. And some of the mines in China, such as antimony, tungsten, etc., are not necessarily available in other countries. Because China has so many mines that have not been exploited, it has made people covet them and want to seize them, causing wars and other things. This is like a giant house declining, and the children are lazy and do nothing, sighing all day long. In fact, they have a lot of hidden money behind their house. There are dozens of gold bars and dozens of silver jars. How can it not make people jealous. Therefore, some people with robber-like hearts want to find a way to rob them.</p>

<h3>An Outline of the Huqin (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When I see books on Western music, I have endless feelings. The Chinese concept of "it can only be understood, not expressed in words" is too deep. Not only has there been no progress in technology, but there is not even a book that teaches people to understand and apply. Even if someone has cultivated a certain skill very well, there is ultimately no way to record it and it cannot be preserved, and those who come later do not make further progress from it. (Although the reasons are not limited to this.) So it has gotten worse and worse. No wonder it can't compare with the development of Western music. I am not against learning Western music, but what about our own music? It is a pity that the true inheritance has been lost. Western music was not so complete from the beginning, but it has reached today's stage after many times of research and improvement. I have also studied Western music for some time, and I have spent eighteen years of hard work on the Huqin, but I still cannot achieve my ideal goal. If I had studied the violin for eighteen years, then I might have become a very famous violinist. This is not because the Huqin is more difficult than the violin, but because the method of the Huqin does not have a reliable method for research, and the so-called famous masters cannot teach me every day. The most painful thing is that there is no systematic method for research. I am now writing some theories about the Huqin, which are still very simple. I hope to make a systematic and methodical special book in the future.</p>
<p>Starting with Jia San</p>
<p>The history of Peking Opera is very short, and the widespread use of the Huqin came later. As for the oldest Huqin, some people say it was plucked, not bowed. Therefore, the history of the Huqin used in Peking Opera is very shallow. Because there is no special book to investigate, the previous one is now unclear. Even knowing its history is of no practical benefit. But there is one thing worth commemorating, that is, the horsehair on the bows used before was very loose, and when playing, it had to be wrapped around the wrist, so the wrist strength could not be used, and it could only be stiff like sawing wood. Since Jia San, he invented the use of a hard bow, that is, tightening the horsehair, which has made it much easier to play since then. Some old Hui Opera troupes still stubbornly use the old method to play, which is really ridiculously stupid. Jia San had two apprentices—Mei Yutian and Sun Zuochen. I have not been able to hear Mei Yutian, but in the Mei family's successor, Mr. Chen Yanheng, I can appreciate the pattern and flavor of Mei's original style, but I dare not comment because I have not heard his master after all, this is just indirectly. Sun Zuochen was a master of the generation, with very good pronunciation and a style different from others. There are still people learning Sun's way now. However, there are many who look like him but are not. Lu Yanting and later Mr. Xu Lanyuan made improvements in the pattern, creating various methods, which is also a kind of progress. Later, my teacher, Mr. Wang Shaoqing, came out and completely changed the previous clichés. Whether in terms of technology or thought, he was unprecedented, especially his inner psychology revealed a spirit, which temporarily affected the Qin masters across the country. All those who could play the Huqin changed their style because of him. This is a meritorious figure in the art world.</p>
<h3>"Robin Hood" Director William Keighley to Visit Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiaochun</p>
<p>Warner Bros. is Preparing to Welcome Keighley to Visit Shanghai War Relics</p>
<p>"Robin Hood," one of last year's top ten blockbusters produced by Warner Bros., caused a sensation among over ten thousand spectators in this city, with its box office success remaining strong. It is rumored that it will soon make a comeback, which is excellent news for those who have not yet seen it. The film is the work of the famous director William Keighley. It is now known that Keighley finished directing "Each Dawn I Die" (tentative translation), starring James Cagney and George Raft, at the end of March. He then left Hollywood with his new wife, Genevieve Tobin, for a honeymoon trip around the world. On May 2nd, they will arrive in Shanghai from Kobe aboard the Japanese Empress. After staying for a few days, they are scheduled to go to Hong Kong on the 5th, and then fly to Saigon. Mrs. Tobin played the role of Priscilla Lane's aunt in Keighley's film "Yes, My Darling Daughter," which will be released at the Cathay Theatre on the 11th of next month.</p>
<p>When the Keighleys arrive in Shanghai, they will stay at the International Hotel. Warner Bros. officials in Shanghai are currently preparing to welcome them. It is reported that Keighley will visit famous Shanghai theaters such as the Grand Theatre and the Cathay, as well as grand dance halls such as the Lido and Ciro's. He will also visit Zhabei to view the war relics of the Shanghai Battle.</p>
<p>Keighley has been working in the theater for twenty-two years, including twelve years as an actor and ten years as a director. Therefore, he has rich experience and deserves to be a famous director. He was born in Philadelphia, USA, and loved theater art since childhood. After completing his education, he joined a theater troupe and excelled in playing various Shakespearean plays. At that time, touring troupes used old scripts. Keighley was the first to sell his self-written new modern scripts, such as "Just Suppose," etc., more than ten plays in total, to Curtiss, and he himself served as director or actor for most of them. He went to Paris to study French stage plays for two years. After returning to New York, he directed "The Perfect Alibi" with Hopkin. He then went to London to direct several scripts. After returning to New York, he directed "Penny Arcade," and stars Joan Blondell and James Cagney were promoted to fame by him. The play was owned by Al Jolson, who sold it to Warner Bros., and Keighley went with him to Hollywood. Then he directed famous plays such as "Grand Hotel" and "Elizabeth the Queen," and also directed "Tomorrow &amp; Tomorrow" for Belasco's Theater in Los Angeles, and also translated and directed Rostand's famous play "Cyrano de Bergerac".</p>
<p>With such rich knowledge and experience, his reputation grew day by day. Warner Bros. hired him, initially as a play director and then as a consultant director, to gain practical experience, because directing films and directing stage plays are slightly different. Five years ago, he began to direct "The Working Man" independently. Since then, he has directed many famous films, such as "College Coach," "Emperor for a Day," "Sweet Music," "The Man Who Came to Dinner," "Footlight Serenade," "Princess O'Rourke," "Secret Service of the Air," "Brother Rat," "Valley of the Giants," and "Yes, My Darling Daughter," which will soon be released at the Cathay Theatre. The blockbuster "Robin Hood" is a masterpiece by Keighley and M. Curtiz.</p>
<p>Last year (1938), he married Tobin and lived in a not-so-luxurious but very comfortable house in Brentwood. Recently, he built a swimming pool, so he does not have to go far to enjoy his favorite sport.</p>

<p>Dance World Sketches (19)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Truth, Beauty, Goodness</h3>
<p>Two years ago, I wrote an article for the commemorative special issue of Lotte Ji, entitled "The Three Principles of Drama: Truth, Beauty, and Goodness." The motivation for this was inspired by reading the novel "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness" by the senior fellow Zeng Mengpu. Yesterday, I saw the advertisement published by the Sin Lok Dance Palace in this newspaper, which also used "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness" as the title, with the smaller words "Sound, Light, Seat" attached above. I wonder if it means "True Sound, Beautiful Light, Good Seat." Perhaps the person in charge of the advertisement for Sin Lok also thought of it because of Mr. Zeng's novel? As for my article, the writing was not good, and the circulation was small, so it certainly does not have the value of being adopted by others.</p>
<p>I believe that no matter what kind of art, if it is to move people, it cannot escape the three conditions of truth, beauty, and goodness. In other words, if one possesses the three conditions of truth, beauty, and goodness, and cannot attract people, it has never happened. In the Peking Opera world, there is often the saying of "acting a play as if it were real." Some time ago, the Carlton performed the play "Wen Ruyu," and the sound of weeping from the audience was almost greater than the sound of the strings and singing on the stage. This is the moving aspect of the word "truth." So, how should we talk about the "truth, beauty, and goodness" of the dance hall? Let's analyze it based on what I have seen. Whether it is right or wrong, I still need the guidance of experts.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that dance halls should be beautified. The decoration of the walls, the arrangement of the tables and chairs, the floor of the dance floor, the color of the lights, the pleasantness of the music, the costumes, figure, and appearance of the dancers all need to be carefully considered. The dancers are stiff, and if you don't make them feel satisfied, they won't come. This requires a lot of people to rack their brains. Before Mr. Xie Baosheng took over Sin Lok, it was often worried about losses, but now there are often surpluses. This is not a matter of brightness, but if you go to Sin Lok and study it carefully, the conditions for beauty have indeed been greatly improved.</p>
<p>The conditions of truth and goodness seem to be irrelevant to the dance hall from a superficial point of view, but if we delve into it, beauty alone is not complete. For example, if we make a more beautiful model of a dance hall dancer out of wax, no one would spend money to bring her over to sit on the stage. Furthermore, if a more beautiful dancer treats others with malice, while another dancer treats others with kindness, even if her beauty is slightly inferior, I think most people would still be happy to choose the one who is kind and slightly less beautiful. Now, I will give a judgment: "Truth" means sincerity, not deception. "Goodness" means without malice. I often see some movie theaters advertising "Full houses every show. Buy tickets quickly," or words like "Don't wait," but when you visit, the number of seats is as sparse as the stars in the morning. In fact, the movies being shown are not that bad, but it has already caused customers a bad impression, and future advertisements will be less effective.</p>
