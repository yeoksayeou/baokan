<h3>日本新攻勢與戰局</h3>
<p>昨天報載香港消息，日本方面又計畫採取新攻勢。據稱：過了七月，日本用五師團攻宜昌，三師團從贛西包圍長沙，六師團沿着洞庭湖擾湘北。此類消息，並非最可信的諜報；故攻勢採取與吾，發動時期，用兵數量，以及攻擊目標，所傳消息是吾恰合日軍計畫，在在皆是問題，未可便視爲千眞萬確。但證以兩年來的經騐，香港消息有時却極靈敏，歷來不少成績；何况日方再取攻勢，亦自有其理由；所謂騎上虎背，欲罷不能；這在驕橫躁進者，終必如此悲哀，輕在者，終必如此顚躓；識者早予估定，不是意外。至於怎樣確定結局，祇是時間問題罷了。因此之故，我們不問消息究竟何所根據，何自傳來，甯願鄭重期待續來消息的證實。</p>
<p>戰爭是行動，勝敗是事實，最後的事實是不可爭的鐵案。至於半途局勢如何，不足爲憑。長距離競爭是最確切的譬喻：劉長春氣槪雄偉，他把握着速戰速決而制勝於初期的一百米，二百米，乃至四百米八百米；但出了萬目睽睽的運動場，轉入內地，繞一個大圈，便絕對沒有他的地位；最後勝利必然的歸屬於骨瘦如柴，似乎營養不足的王正林。現在朋明是長距離競走，乃在四百米八百米的當兒，喝令停步，陰謀中止，無論以王正林滿頭大汗爲理由，出以悲天憫人的作風，但如何可以掩飾劉長春祇是短跑健將？喜怒哀樂，淋漓盡致，祗暴露了他的認識不足；捧劉長春，咒王正林，有何益處？明知不用捧，不必咒，我們沉默着不多談戰局。現在偶爾得到上述的香港消息，請就消息，略述我們對於戰局的見解。</p>
<p>日本方面最初希望速戰速決，也祇準備了速戰速決。初步失敗了，第二步希望在筋疲力竭之前，克竟全功，也許仍能鯨呑　括，爲所欲爲。第二步絕望了，第三步希望有一妙法，換一方式，永久保持它戰爭初期所得的軍事佔領區域。目前戰局，正從第二步踏進第三步。</p>
<p>從第二步踏進第三步，以政治與經濟爲重，以軍事爲輕。假定舉重若輕，確然妙極，不料事實並不如此。姑就淺處近處爲例：一，南京北平兩組織，不但不能爲日軍分勞，且非日軍保護，不克存在；二，各地地方組織，日軍若放任而不預聞，却不放心，放任了但見漢奸的趁火打刧；三，法幣在黑匯市大跌特跌，從一先令二五降爲六七辨士；法幣大跌，敵人拍掌稱快，誰知日幣一圓始終祗値法幣九角幾分，換一句話說，日圓已緊跟了法幣跌價。這從政治經濟上說明第二步到第三步，還非軍事的硬幹不可。這也就是採取新攻勢的主因吧。再從軍事說，『進攻是最好的守勢』，自有其技術的原因，故攻宜昌爲了保武漢，攻長沙爲了保南昌，攻湘北爲了保岳州；况又不但如此而已。第一，驕橫躁進而輕在者，尚未絕望於『克竟全功』；不到最後，不知末日的降臨，故取攻勢。第二，中國公然宣稱採取機動的作戰；亦即在抗戰的意義之下，始終運用堅守與反攻兩種方式；故日軍不攻宜昌則華軍必攻武漢，亦即日軍不能取宜昌則並不能守武漢，故取攻勢。第三，戰局沉悶三閱月，究竟是抗戰已成弩末，還是改編訓練補充將近完成；事須試探，故取攻勢。軍事上有這三項原因，演爲可能的採取攻勢。此外，英日兩國的東京談判，以白本在軍事上發揮更大的聲勢，爲外交上最有力的後盾；充極其量而言之，中國若放棄抗戰，英國早已被逐出遠東之外，何來現在的東京談判；日軍若長驅直入，英國早已喪失立足之地，何來現在的東京談判；中國若已將日軍逐出領域之外，何來現在的束京談判；可知中國戰局與東京談判其中有着不可分的關係，那末，在東京談判開始之際，日方表示再取攻勢，亦自有國際的理由。蘇日在諾蒙亨的戰爭，其事實因果，其宣傳眞僞，姑勿深究；但已使日人氣餒，已使日軍徬徨，這是必然的。故在幾路調兵應援的同時，唯有宣稱在華再取攻勢。最足以掩飾捉襟見肘的窘態；這是另一個國際的理由。</p>
<p>這是長距離競走！無論距離如何長，總之越走越近；無論日本的採取新攻勢，或中國的發動總反攻，總之是接近終點的重要動態。動態所造就的事實，不是捧或咒所能麻醉的；也不是一切喜怒哀樂，所能變更的；最後的事實，即是最確實的歸宿；最後歸宿之前，以新攻勢爲重要階段，拭月以待可也。</p>

<h3>歐亞風雲激盪中　世界和戰問題　但澤危機仍屬一觸即發　戈林膺德意空軍總司令　叔棣六月三十日於倫敦</h3>
<p>倫敦航訊，愈是密切地注視着各種客觀形勢的演變，我們愈是不得不感到，今天的全世界，確是一天一天地，在走向一個不可分離的，整個有機體的境地。比如這裏這個問題：</p>
<p>「和平呢還是戰爭？」</p>
<p>廣義地說，國際性的戰爭，早就在這世界上進行了好幾年，所謂「和平」也者，早就消失了牠的存在，所有一切的世界各國，分起類的話，是僅僅有作戰的和準備作戰的兩大類，根本無所謂「局外」，常然更談不到「中立」。但是，如果說戰爭云云；僅是指實際參加作戰，猶如上决世界大戰的方式，那末，這一决的世界大戰，確是還沒有正式揭幕。在這時候，要是眞有決心去挽救世界和平的話，那末，看起來，也還是十分可能的。不過那途撫却毫無疑義的，僅僅祗有兩條；一條是由決心維持和平的各國，組成一個壓倒優勢地位的集團，以準備一戰的決心，對於一切近幾年來的侵略成果，加以取消和補救，而對於那些正在侵略着的，則加以强迫制止，跟着，則未來的侵略自然消弭於無形了。到那時，所謂和平也者，方始奠下了基礎，不然的話，就採取另一條途徑，那是，由決心維持和平的各國澈底合作起來，强調集體安全制，把正在侵略着國家，首先予以擊敗，那其餘的侵略國，自然要縮了回去，然後，就可以進一步謀世界未來和平的奠定。</p>
<p>不久以前美國大總統羅斯福的向德意提出的詢問，那規模，多多少少，是循着第一條途徑的。至於第二條途徑的例子，我們可以舉出近年來蘇聯政府所採取的，援助被侵略國家的政策。除此而外，那些劃分地域，個別應付，拆散侵略國集團的企圖，結果是反而墮入了牠們交相爲用的陷阱，至於以爲可以予以相當滿足，即可令牠們適可而止的想頭，那是事實上更加會提高了牠們的慾求。到了最後，不獨不能挽救世界和平，反而會促進大規模戰爭的爆發。</p>
<p>可是我們檢討一下近來國際形勢的進展，我們不得不承認：客觀事實的演變，是已經超出了主觀力量的控制了。所以雖然有着美俄兩國的主觀努力，但整個的形勢發展却一天一天地，更加接近了那個大戰的來臨。</p>
<p>對於這倘大戰前夜的階段，通常說法，是有一個專門名詞的，那是：「危機」。目前的歐洲又到處充滿了另一個「危機」到來的預報。</p>
<p>首先，英法蘇合作談判的一再躭擱，使德國的舉動，近來顯得特別活躍起來。希特拉是下了全力，在籌劃着如何阻止這個同盟的成立，現在我們確切地知道，他已經在近來這幾天內，取得了波羅的海沿岸各國的堅定承諾；萬一英法蘇自動担保她們獨立與完整的話，那末，她們是一定要首先予以拒絕，甚至抵抗的。這一點，如果在兩個禮拜前英法蘇同盟成立的話，那時，也許還沒有這麼僵硬，現在這局面，確實是有點麻煩了。不過，僅以目前狀况而論，如果馬上英法蘇成立同盟，那末，祗要費一點事，也還是可以挽回。値得担心的，倒是希特拉的第二步陰謀，那是一等英法蘇談判失敗後，他計劃着向蘇聯提議，共同担保她們的安全。蘇聯那時的是吾接受，固然是問題，但僅就這一提儀的本身而論，對她們這一流弱小國家，目前確有着無比的誘惑性。</p>
<p>萬一英法蘇談判這麼毫無結果地拖下去，那末，到了本年的八月一號左右，德國就有了一百五十萬的軍隊動員起來。那時，希特拉會立刻提出了收回但澤的要求。德國的計劃，大概是先在但澤內部醞釀一個分裂運動，屆時可以順流而下，好像去年的奧國一樣。至於那一百五十萬大軍的動員，主要的還是爲了向波蘭和英法示威。直到目前爲止，英國雖一再地警告德國，萬一以武力威脅，提出要求的話，英國是絕不能坐視，如果波蘭覺得有抵抗的必要，那末，英國是準備履行英波協定，共同動作的。同時，波蘭也在一再宣稱，她絕不能讓但澤歸入德國，必要時，寗可一戰，但是，德國是絕對不相信這些表示的。她認定了，如果她的一切估計不錯，那未到時候，英波唯一可走的路，大概是祗有屈服。所以，希特拉打算着，在九月裏，一年一度國社黨大會的席上，無論如何，他一定可以在那時以前取得但澤，作爲一件外交的勝利，而提出來報告。</p>
<p>上一决四月二十九號的，襲取但澤的危機，我們知道，是墨索里尼的熊度猶豫，把牠暫時打消掉的。現在，這計劃養的，對但澤的陰謀，當然，也正在磋商之於墨索里尼。墨索里尼的下一决熊度如何呢？現在就各方面看，似乎還沒有確定，不久以前，墨索里尼爲了這個，曾特別訓令駐英大使格蘭第，令他考察英國可能的反應態度。後來，這位以反英著名的格蘭第大使，這一决，却立刻報告着說，以英國目前的熊度而論，任何在歐洲的侵略，她是大的要抵抗的了，這個報告，一達到羅馬時，首先爲意外長齊亞諾所見。這位齊亞諾，是主張親德最力的，希特勒的崇拜者，所以，他立刻不以那裏面的意見爲然，而把牠壓下了，並沒有讓墨索里尼看見，直到最近，格蘭第回到羅馬時，他方把詳細情形，告訴了墨索里尼。因而引起了墨索里尼對齊亞諾的大大不滿。大概在對於這事的熊度上，直至目前，墨索里尼和齊亞諾之間，還多多少少的，有着一些分岐。</p>
<p>這兩天來，因爲德軍紛紛集中波前邊境，歐洲人心，叉惶惶不安了起來。不過，依情勢推測，短期間內，似乎還不至來一個突然的進襲。</p>
<p>意大利準備在非洲侵略英，法領土的陰謀，近來，有了進一步的具體發展。上個禮拜，意大利的陸，空兩軍當局曾和德國當局在柏林舉行重要會議，决定一切未來進攻的計劃</p>
<p>我們祗知道意大利的空軍代表，是航空部長外里將軍，代表德國的，却是密里黑將軍，事後據傳，大概將來萬一發生大戰時，德，意空中聯軍的總司令，已定爲現在德國「四年經濟計劃」獨裁者戈林將軍担任。而且聽說已下了正式任命狀。</p>
<p>决定的作戰計劃，首先大概是分兩路會攻埃及，一路由意屬利比亞出發，一路由阿比西尼亞出發，最後目的地，在於蘇伊士運河。與攻埃及的同時，另有兩路軍隊，由阿比西尼亞的公達爾（Goudar）出發，一路攻英埃蘇丹的哈薩拉（Kassala）一路攻喀土穆（Khartoum），這個計劃，是由德方提出來的。</p>
<p>不過，上述的計劃，在意大利方面，却有些著名的軍事人員加以反對，如巴爾波將軍，拔多里阿將軍等等，至於德國提出這一計劃的最大理由呢，却是因爲法國在突尼斯所築的工事，在目前，已經難予以摧毀，而英國在埃及的準備，離完成還遠哩，所以先向埃及方面下手，比較易於致勝。</p>
<p>與上述在非洲侵略計劃的同時，作爲歐洲牽制作用的種種計劃，也在加緊進行，在意大利西北，沿着亞爾卑斯山脚下，向着法國的那條防綫，近來，由德國派了大批的技術人員，帮着從事加强工事。據德國估計，萬一大戰發生，法軍是會打算由這裏突進意大利的，所以一等道條防綫和德，奧方面的防綫一銜接，那末，在一個大戰裹，至少短期內，英，法聯軍，是無法由陸上開入東歐，給波，羅，土，等國以援助的了。</p>
<p>這一條防綫的加强工事，無論怎様，德，意，定在七月底以前完成。到了那時，萬一德國提出但澤要求，那末，她是指望拿這給波蘭一個警告，暗示以英，法，援助的無望，而不如對德屈服。</p>
<p>比上面一些更足以表示侵略集團國家彼此呼應的，是近來德，日，意，三國聯繫的密切。兩禮拜前的那篇通訊裏，記者曾指出過，如果日本在天津租界問題上，對英失敗的話，那末，她蹙會立刻加入德，意，軍事同盟的。現在知道，實在的情形，還不止於此。最近德國的福斯特海軍大將，爲了察看日本軍人推動加入德，意，軍事同盟的可能，曾奉希特拉的命令赴日，並且已經向希特拉提出了報告。他的報告，大概可以這麼分成幾點。（一）不獨對英租界問題失敗後，一定加入德，意同盟，縱使勝利，勝利後也一定加入。原因是，那様子，可以牽制以後的英，法，干涉，一勞而永逸。（二）據日軍當局說：大概八月中以前，可以有一個最後結論。（三）不獨天津英租界，日軍的意思，打算廢除，中國各處的原有的一切外國租界，都在計劃廢除之列。將來由日軍和德，意，簽定經濟條的，以德，意經濟商業，代替過去的英，美，法等國。</p>
<p>當記者寫着這篇通訊時，正是英國政府打算和日本在東京談判解決天津事件的時候。現在，英國全國的與論，對於政府，都處在一種反感而又有點懷疑的空氣之中。不過，照現在情形推測，在所謂「較大範圍」問題上，似乎還說着絕沒有讓步的餘地。</p>
<p>就整個國際形勢而論，不獨英，法，蘇同盟的需要，是非常的迫切，英，美，法步調一致的需要，是非常的迫切，而在這時，英，法，蘇，和站在她們之間的，比較有力的友邦，如波，土，及中國之間，又何嘗不急需更進一步的默契和合作。</p>
<p>這一切，都在指示着，世界和平是不可分的，安全也是如此。</p>
<h3>滿洲是日本重累（續）</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>數字難以取信</p>
<p>軍閥和他們的宣傳者說：日本對滿洲的輸出增加了，這話不錯，有數字可以證明，但是，當這些貿易數字用來表示日本已由此而獲利的時候，便令人憶及美國有一句老話說：「數字並不說謊，可是數字是說謊者所製的。」因爲滿洲普通華人貧窮不堪，缺乏購買力，現在日本輸出的棉貨和其他物料，供滿洲羣眾消費的，確已低落了。日本對滿洲輸出物大增的，只有某幾類特殊物品，其中包括鐵路和建築材料，以應軍閥在侵佔區中，作軍略上和工業上的需要，還包括汽車，小麥，麵粉，啤酒，菓類等等，供日本軍閥，或他們的屬下的幕僚們消費各項。「奢侈品」現在雖已劇减，然而關於滿日貿易關係，一切經濟的局勢，依然未變，日本輸往滿洲的物品，無論是供軍略上和工業上之用的，或是供日人統治階級和華人傀儡個人享樂用的，都是從每年由日本傾入滿洲，供軍事和「投資」之用的幾萬萬日元中提出償付價値。輸出品的性質，已使這點明晰而絕無疑義，它們多半是由在滿洲的日人代替在日本的日人消耗的，付其代價的，却是資助軍閥的日本納稅人。</p>
<p>即在一九三七年長城以南的戰爭開始之前，日本人民所荷滿洲重負的可怖，已嚴重地感覺到了。自一九三一年日本開始侵佔滿洲以來，滿洲的重負已達二十萬萬日元以上，日本的經濟已因這種重負而暴露嚴重的緊張，而軍閥却在這種緊張的經濟之下從事目前的戰事。自從開戰時起，因爲須應付滿洲華人的叛變，中國第八路軍的攻入，和蘇聯方面予以打擊的恐怖的可能，所以軍閥在滿洲的支出，已大見增加。如今夏日本因力竭而崩潰，那原因多半是由於軍閥侵佔滿洲，以不能支持的負担，加於日本人民的肩上，這是追溯已往而可了然的。（完）</p>
<h3>淪陷後之定海　滿目淒涼</h3>
<p>定海通信、定海位浙江之東、爲我國漁鹽業之大產地、自於上月二十三日、遭日軍佔據後、各方對於定海近狀、均極關懷、茲將最近情形、分述於後、</p>

<p>燒殺甚慘</p>
<p>本城北門外頭橋附近之洪家祠堂、前曾爲定海縣工程通訊人員訓練班班本部、爲軍用電話總機之所在、因此日軍搜查至北郊時、當即將該祠堂縱火焚燬、付之一炬、近聞日軍搜查至東門外西起嶺時、見一在鄉避難之新娘、貌甚秀美、日軍即欲姦污、該新娘見之、駭極而逃、日軍乃放一槍中腰重傷、後復放二槍、遂被擊死、又東港浦冰廠主人金阿有、携秤去稱冰、亦被棄擊斃、</p>
<p>日艦戒備</p>
<p>日軍自佔領定海後、因恐華軍波海反攻、故現調集各地日艦、分泊舟山羣島、以爲防備、聞現停泊定海各島者的計七八艘、二艘泊　　附近、一艘泊余塘洋面、一艘泊馬峙洋面、一艘泊朱家尖洋面、二艘泊岱山高亭、東沙角等處、一艘泊螺門附近、又據聞東港浦民生精鹽廠面前、並停有水上飛機六七架、由此可見其畏　遊擊隊渡海反攻之情形也、</p>

<h3>金融家談新輔幣劵　印刷成本　應將紙値提高　平準會不保障</h3>
<p>流通市面之銅鎳輔幣、自蒙某方收買囤集影響、烟兌鈔兌兩業會員莊號、雖竭力設法應付市面需要、然仍不免缺乏恐慌、中行發行局奉財部令、已在香港中華書局印製一分與五分之輔幣券、不久行將大量</p>
<p>運滬流通</p>
<p>大光社記者昨特以此事向金融界某鉅子徵詢該券流通、今後是吾仍將蒙收買缺乏影響、請予發表意見、據稱、我國以前輔幣、原係銅鈔銅元、後以百物價格高漲銅鈔銅値超過銅鈔之値、所以廢銅鈔而祇用銅元、不久銅元又感受上述影響、財部當局會於廢兩改元之後、即新鑄一分銅質輔幣、及五分一角二角鎳質輔幣、迄至中日戰事發生、百物價格一再飛漲、以致該銅輔幣之値、小於該幣銅値倍屠、此幣旣屬軍用重要原料、一方又可達到淆亂平民日常需要之</p>
<p>經濟企圖</p>
<p>遂被收買、今主管機關劉於此種問題、尤能洞燭其中利弊、故特發行新輔幣券流通、依據本人意見、中行發行此新券、財部應盡量提高該一分五分新券紙値、最好超過幣値三四倍以上、繫如該券明爲一分之幣値、而其紙之質地成本價格、反値三四分之數、該券每種明明發行一百萬元之幣値、即成本反需三四百萬元、如此、對此虧本事業、常不禁而自行收歇、且此種新券、祇限上海之淪陷區域使用、平準委員會再不予保障、對於國際市場、不生問題、實爲最妙之預防保壘、姑備一說、以供參考、</p>

<h3>上海禁毒內幕　毒物科主任辭職時所談　上海之毒物多來自天津</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、公共租界警務處毒物科主任林特、最近巳辭職、本週初將離滬赴新加坡、頃晤記者、林民首稱、以渠之地位、不能談及之事甚多、然林氏確披露禁毒工作之詳情、據稱、所抄獲數量較大之鴉片。海洛因。或其他任何毒物、絕大多數係運此毒物來滬之倫船船員供給情報而抄出、警務處毒物科僱有大批</p>
<p>中外密探</p>
<p>華探大都按照其情報所獲得之結果而給資、若干外人則有固定薪給、林氏旋言及外人結黨、於已往十餘年中從事毒物買賣、結果已成鉅富、此輩僑居本埠之外人、國籍不同、以中歐人爲最多、記者詢毒物如何</p>
<p>運來上海</p>
<p>材氏答稱、曩者若輩自天津由鐵道運來、然自軍興以還、若輩遂用假遞箱箧裝船運來、一般人以爲製成之鴉片、大半出自上海、其實不然、上海僅爲世界此部份毒物買賣之銷售中心地、海外</p>
<p>抄獲鴉片</p>
<p>恒指上海爲其出處、實則鴉片之來源或出處、乃爲天津、目前運入美國而被抄獲或業已運入美國之大量海洛因、係自香港運往者、毒物買賣之重要特點、爲許多携毒者完全無辜、甚且不知自己</p>

<h3>工部局發表六月份　工業概況　絲繭原料缺乏堪虞　物價指數又復增高</h3>
<p>各業會議</p>
<p>前月曾召集小燈泡工廠會議一次、本月份復又舉行一决、關於同業應遵守之標準、商議已有進步、同時又學行梵皇渡車站附近各皮革廠會議、討論結果、訂開自流井一口、供作皮革廠十三家公共之用、現決再開二决會議、以便商討沉澱池事宜</p>

<p>生活指數</p>
<p>工人生活費之指數、其總指數照一九三六年百分基數、高達一七六。一五、又造成新紀錄、近七個月來、繼續增高、本月份比上月增百分之六。八四、比上年六月份增百分之一五。四八、故本月總指數之倒數爲五六·七七、故一九三六年一元之購買力、至本月僅値·五六七七元、其分類與上月相比、食物增百分之十·九四、雜項增百分之六·〇三、燃料類增百分之三。八二、衣服類减百分之四。二一、</p>

<h3>港滬英僑強迫軍役　遠東風雲急轉　兩地英籍壯丁不得規避　港政府命令已到達上海</h3>
<p>本埠英僑、於十五日晚接獲香港英政府命令、關於香港英籍壯丁、已奉命參與香港防務工作、上海年靑英籍壯丁、亦須服役、不得規避、聞該强迫軍役之實施、目的在組成一强勁有力之後備軍、性質與上海之義勇團相似、港政府此種緊急措施、頗與遠東風雲急轉有關、</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨據本埠英人方面非正式消息、上海英僑未必將受香港政府本星期命令之强微訓練、因上海英僑靑年之精壯者、業已加入上海萬國商團、且上海缺少應付大隊受長期的不斷訓練之便利、再承平時期上海英僑與香港英人之受統制、頗多不同、戰爭發生、則微兵法當然公允的適用於每一適宜作戰之英人云、</p>

<h3>偷得半日閒　集體報告　一·仲夏的園景</h3>
<p>夏天的氣候，不一定會惱人，如果天上有薄薄的黑雲，將驕陽遮住，你立在大可合抱的古樹下，你準覺得週身碧綠，一股凉意。</p>
<p>這種境地，像北平中山公園，幾乎隨時可以遇到，那裏有高齡的古柏，枝葉交柯，綠天綠地,凌晨和午後，散步一回，反覺得夏天之可愛？</p>
<p>在上海，不必說塵囂萬斛　肯選就現實，不悵望匡廬之雲，亦不必說無地可去，你如果，不其想莫干之竹，你能够以半日餘閒，到西郊兆豐公園一游，準可把一切煩惱，暫時拋却。這裏有小橋流水，古木蒼松，還有土阜可登。</p>
<p>兆豐公園當然不能和北平中山公園比儗，所謂各有所長，無分軒輊。依我個人的見解，中山公園，頗殷古趣，那裏的特長，是有廻廊，曲檻，和水榭，是供「士大夫」之流去游賞的，圍棋一局，再加上一壺香片，儘可以無憂無慮，盤桓永日。兆豐公園的特點，在於艷麗，活潑，平坦和纖巧，匆匆地走，匆匆地看，不容你沉滯着流連不去，也不使得你一覽無餘，雖無古趣，但亦恰到好處。</p>
<p>由於天天感傷着孤島生活，大家有點苦悶，經S君建議，於星期日作兆豐公園之游，相的在池畔等待。我們都是中年人了，但靑年活躍的氣質，多少還保持一點，午夜遲眠，尚能早起，大家都於的定時間到達，於是携着鏡箱，開始行進。</p>
<p>應當先從進園門時說起，呈露在眼前的，是一條灣曲寬闊而且很長的水泥路，舉目四望，蒼綠的氣氛，令入胸襟頓時爲之」爽。沿着路前進，右面是灣灣的小河，荇藻浮萍之類，長得滿滿的。左面碧綠的一片大廣場，場的中央，就是很大的一個池塘，池畔的草地，高低起伏，有垂楊，有常綠樹，還有一個茆亭，沿着河岸的叫週，隨便放些椅子，大人們坐着憩息，孩子們便在池畔盪着小船，這是進園後所見到的一個輪廊，倘是詳細描寫，有點浪廢筆墨罷！我且寫茲園的妙處。</p>
<p>兆豐公園的妙處，在於草地之有坡度，遠遠望去，不覺得平凡，萃地雖然很寬闊廣大，但多是隨着自然地形設計的，有幾處長着大樹，有幾處架着小亭，灣曲幽倩處佈置着石凳，甚至於有些地方，草地隨坡度一路平衍下去，眼力所窮，一望不盡。</p>
<p>其决，此園獨多小徑，綠陰四覆中，似無去處，仔細一看，却有石子小路，雖然短短的，但很富詩意。如果在月夜，徘徊在這些小石路上，月影滿地，淸空靜寂，必有人間何世之感。</p>
<p>再其决，園裏雖無活水，但幽僻之處，亦有細流伏地，上架小橋。橋的製作，非常樸雅，全是用木段釘成的。或平衍如坦途，或隆起如駝背，隨地易形，顯得不俗。</p>
<p>園的西部，新建土阜，自跌至頂，大的數十步，均鋪以石級，遍植綠竹，好像杭州的韜光竹徑。我們在山巔眺望了好久，綠樹茆亭，波光雲影，都一覽無餘，雅有烟水之趣。</p>
<p>這樣盤桓了半天，眞所謂匆匆地走，匆匆地看，在如張華蓋的古松下，體會到夏天的凉意。大家也曾想到北平中山公園的古柏；所可喜者，我們並不失望，我們都有信心結伴北游，也不是沒有指望的事。</p>
<p>先生說：夢也許成爲事實的Dream　may　berealised，我們不是在夢中，爲什麼不踏上光明之路呢（景行）</p>

<h3>女子缺乏愛力的幾種區分</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>男子先天性缺乏愛情的，很是少見；然而女子却很多，醫舉上呌做一性的缺乏症」。也有性力微弱，對養愛結合冷淡的，呌做「鈍感症」。也有愛力存在，但是不惹起快感的，呌做「快感缺乏症」。也有生殖機關，並沒發生障碍，只有愛力不發達，和小兒似的，呌做「精神的性的小兒症。」這種女子，往往與丈夫絕無情愛，男子被迫不得不向家庭外滿足他的慾望，遂迭成男子宿娼，蓄妾，和姦通的一大原因。</p>
<p>女子的缺乏愛力，雖有的爲先天性之關係，然社會上常有因男子精力渙散，腎虧而早洩，在性生活上不能予妻子以滿足，久而久之，妻子遂感覺性感之遲鈍，形成永無快感的機會，此即釀成一部分不感症的主因。</p>
<p>有人說：「女子的愛力，比男子微弱。」這是表面的話，實際講起來，女子的愛力，決不比男子微弱；要是橫決起來，或者還要高過男子，也未可知。况且女子易動感情，容易受異性誘惑，更喜歡官能的享樂；執是以觀，故一個陰痿早洩之丈夫，他不受妻子所歡迎，這是當然之事了。</p>
<p>我想，一個丈夫總不願使妻子受到此種苦悶，故最佳的辦法，唯有趕快增精補腎，以培植其靑春腺之繁榮，因爲人體內之靑春腺，爲主宰性慾的重要腺器，故能使靑春腺强壯，上述之病，即告消失，余爲性病專門醫師，知此種疾病，唯有服以德國眞正睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」始能澈底根治，蓋「補體康」之成分除睾丸精質之外，尚有補腦之燐質溶入其內，故對於神經衰弱，失眠健忘，頗有奇效，此余在臨床實騐上久所信賴，臨診七年從未遇失效病例，至於女子性慾缺乏，不感症等，非服女甩「補體康」不可，良由該劑功能調經種子，爲婦科聖藥。</p>

<p>一個人患了肺病好着了洗不淸的油衣，着實覺到有點可怕。患者因其性極慢，多不留不云注意牠。及到病家自己發現是肺結核，而要云醫治，又苦於經濟能力之不足，或者不知服何藥為最有特效。余於肺病之經騐，惟德國街梅博士所發明之肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」一藥，功效最勝。因此藥服後可以增强肺部之抵抗力，並直接扑滅肺部之結核菌。蓋結核菌之抵抗力極強　，惟有增強本身之抵抗力，以包圍肺結核之毒菌，使其獲不到生活之供給原料，一方增加其四邊之堤防，使頑強之癆菌，完全自斃。而可怖之肺癆病，亦永獲根治了。巿上一般肺病藥，不知個中病原，所以大多無效。而「補肺拿爾」則對準病源發藥，所以能詞奏效。</p>

<h3>暑天宜進補</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>見效勝冬天</p>
<p>我們往往看到許多先天寰弱的人，他們一到冬天，什麼人參啊，鹿茸啊，海狗腎啊，及什麼的賜保命的針，劑啊等，都無不各擇他們自己性之所近的而服用之，但一到炎炎的夏天，却並不用什麼培補的藥物，這實在是錯誤之至。因爲夏天我人之勞動，倍於冬天，其所消耗者，亦倍於其他季節，即以房事而言，夏天因女性多衣蟬翼之衣，袒胸露臂身體婀娜多姿肉感惑人。故允易引起我人想人微微的，凡此等等，都是夏天進補，勝於冬天，實在可說，夏、天的進補，較之冬天允爲重要</p>
<p>但是，夏天進補之重要，大家旣然明白了，而跟上來又一問題，就是服用那一種藥品，才有實效呢？關於這一點，我可就歷年經騐所得，介紹大家。</p>
<p>從補劑本身的立場來看，許多冬天的補品，都嫌牠太膩了，因爲補品太膩，對於胃臟的消化機能，就感到不快。何况在這本來胃口不佳的夏天呢</p>
<p>幸而現在這個問題已經解決了，因爲德國梅倫博士發明靑春腺製劑「補體康」一藥，可稱極適宜的夏天補劑。不燥不膩，服之能振奮精神，促進食慾，使終日工作的人們，不感到一點厭倦，允其在夏天容易感到失眠的人，服「補體康」絕對可以保障不會失眠。因爲「補體康」是增加靑春腺的健全，使食慾與性慾二者均獲到完全的健全。</p>
<h3>腦弱耳鳴的原因</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>耳鳴的情狀不一，有發于偶然，有久嗚而不己，有忽高忽低，有忽止忽作，有人按耳鳴之高低，而區別其發生之原因，謂低者係因傳音器疾患而發，其高者之令屬性者，由感音器疾患而來，但此說亦不甚可靠。</p>
<p>蓋耳嗚發生之原因，甚爲複雜，然大都由於病後失調，先天不足，與後天斷傷所致，然有遺精者，則十九罹患本症，蓋久遺不止，如畦之水，涓涓不息流於外，其結果則農作物失其潤澤，必致枯萎，故久遺之人，面色不澤，形熊萎疲，毫無英秀雄岸之氣象，宜急爲調治，以防久延成損。</p>
<p>關於遺精的治法，選擇有效的藥劑，以鞏固精關，固屬扼要，但若不注意攝生，或有自凟行爲，雖服大量的藥物，可說依然無效，此時患者應淸心寡慾，擴絕淫念，施以神經衰弱療法，絕對必要，服雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」每日三次，每日三片，及在睡前服以「耐而斯遺精片」三片。不僅遺精能够完全根治，而對于遺精所引起的腦弱耳鳴，保證在短期內根治。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>妻子失歡的原因</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>生了淋病的人，大都爲了性的問題，才去拈花惹草，這已經使家有妻室者所不愜意，若更由此而轉染淋病，更何以對房內之佳人以自解？因爲淋毒之病原菌，乃是雙菌球，具有强大之傳染力。假如已染淋毒而已結婚的男子，從人道與愛情方面着想，俱應該先將淋毒治愈，然後再作魚水之歡，可是一般男子，因爲做丈夫者，一方是急廹求其速愈，一方是爲要瞞過妻子之疑心，仍要與妻子敦倫，不知淋菌是最易傳染性之細菌，丈夫之淋病既然是未治愈，則一旦與妻子性交，自然要傳給妻子也。</p>
<p>妻子不幸一旦被丈夫傳染，下體白帶即大量産生，真是受害非小，妻子平白遭此無妄之災，自然對丈夫愛情破裂，推厥原因，俱因男子淋病患者，玩忽本身病毒之故，但要迅速解决淋毒在初起時並非難事。以余經騐，可服彼德博士發明之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，最有特效，因爲「克淋儂」乃根據非特異性療法，採用蛋白體黄色素混合製成。服後於短期內使病家全部細胞，發生一種抗淋噬菌的毒素作，不論初期及遠年老白濁，均能按歩就班，根本肅淸之，余更用德國静電療法，及抗淋血淸審症而用，在三五星期內即可完全根治。即不幸妻子亦已染毒，余賞囑其外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，內服「克淋儂」內外兼治，見功尤速。　診時：上午十時至下午六時自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並送「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>美國銀政策變更之由來</h3>
<p>— 陳成仁</p>
<p>動工了兩年多，到去秋才完工的一座水泥鋼骨的保險庫，是在美國西部的某軍校塲上。四週設着最新式的保護機關。該庫全長二百五十二呎，一百六十六呎闊，二十二呎高。於是將全國所有白銀的一半數目，的有銀條三萬五千噸，自紐的城運至該處，保藏在這樣防衛嚴密的大銀庫中。這個聳人聽聞的消息還栩栩活躍在世界人士的印象裏，但是不到一年，美國高抬銀價的這個政策，現在已被迫修改了，雖則沒有完全取消，但對於海外銀價的收買價格，現已節節降低，據說：這是帶着外交作用的，因爲墨西哥政府想收回美國在墨的油礦權；美國便把貶抑海外銀價來作爲報復手段，又說：因爲日本會在中國的戰區裏搜刮到不少存銀，所以放棄維持銀價的政策來給他一價棒擊。道種說法，倒並不是附會，多少有相當事實可做根據的，不過美國變更銀價政策的根本理由：畢竟還在銀價政策，從未使美國得到若何利益，甚至因此反白賠了實施這個政策的經費，像前述那個銀庫的建築費，便是其中之一，這個無益的政策，除了美國銀礦主及其雇用的議員之外，幾乎沒有人會去擁護，下面便是紐的市立銀行記者所做的一篇反銀價政策的論文；發表在去秋該行的月板上，他從縱的方面指出美國銀政策的變遷，並推斷該政策勢必停止的命運，在美國白銀派失勢的現在讀之，更易於理解這决變動的必然性了。（以下數量單位兩，皆英制）</p>
<p>大約在一百年前，美國已開始注意到白銀問題。一八七八至九三年的十五年中，共計購進白銀四五九，九四九，〇〇〇兩，價値四六二，二一〇，〇〇〇元，後來因爲發生過一次恐慌，由克萊佛蘭Cleveland總統召集國會，議決停止購買，由是白銀問題才告了一個結束。等到歐戰的時候，因爲印度商品出口量激增，以致感到支付工具的缺乏，美國乃將銀幣出售於英國。然而國會中的白銀派還堅持着採用畢德鬥Pittman的方法，即日後仍須將出售的白銀數量設法袖充，並限定買價每兩在一元以上。直到一九三三年全世界發生了經濟恐慌，各處都感覺得貨幣缺乏的現象，因此白銀派便開始要求政府從速買進白銀價格至一·二九的提議。並以爲果能提高白銀價格至一。二九元（按舊日鑄幣率）則必能提高中國方面的購買力，就可以建立複本位制，也就可以恢復全世界的繫榮了，於是在美國領導之下，一九三三年在倫敦舉行了一决白銀會議，成立了八國保存或購貿白銀的協定；美國須購買二四，四一二，四一〇兩（的等於本國生產量）從一九三三年十二月開始購買，每兩値美金六四，六四分，政府收鑄幣率（一，二九元）的百分之五十作爲「鑄幣稅」，市價的叫十三分。到一九三四年六月又通過白銀法，照財長個人意志，要收買白銀至國庫所有數量等於全銀總數的百分之二五為止，但買價不得超過白銀的貨幣價値（即一，二九元）。這樣的白銀法，等於一八七八年和九〇年的白銀法，以為購買白銀的結果，定可提高銀條市價與鑄幣比率相等，而推廣白銀的貨幣用途。該年八月，美總統頒布了白銀國有的命令，將所有商業存銀，一律由政府按照固定價格收集，凡買價與一·二九元間的差額，任務為鑄費。且馬上實行向國外購買，當即有白銀一批計四百噸，由倫敦運至紐約這次的白銀交易，竟創造了白銀橫渡大西洋的最高紀錄。</p>
<p>在當時的經濟恐慌時期，白銀本也跟其他商品同樣跌價。白銀在一九二八年還平均每兩値美金五八分，到一九三二年竟跌至二七·八分，一九三三年因美元晚離金本位及八國協定成立，銀價方維持着三四，七分平均價，一九三四年又因美政府努力平均提高至四七·九分。去年下半年，受美國庫積極購買的影響，與一·二九元的目標，所以又得瘋狂地飛漲過一陣。</p>
<p>其實銀價的飛漲，並不利於中國，也不利於中美的貿易，却和他們的希望相反。因爲中國向來採用銀本位的，銀幣漲價，就是貨物跌價。譬如一九三二年和三三年，因爲中國產品的跌價，就造成貿易不順利和白銀外流等現象。</p>
<p>一九三四年十月，中國政府下令禁止白銀出口，但是因爲銀價普遍騰漲的關係，仍有偷運白銀出口，其數也很可觀。常時白銀投機盛極一時，以致抬價高出美國定價以上。一九三五年四月，倫敦銀價達美金八一分。而美國庫收買本國白銀的價格不過七七，五分，同年十一月中國政府宣佈脫離銀本位，採用管理紙幣制。同時倫敦銀市塲失掉了華盛頓的擁護，馬上發現頭重脚輕的病象，外國白銀，就從八一分跌到四三分。美國銀價，起初仍舊維持七七，五分，到一九三八年初，纔减成六四從八分之一分。</p>
<p>一九三六年五月，中政府請求美政府合作，能使中國的銀行券貨幣和美國貨幣保持穩定的關係。當時就成立協定，美政府購買若干中國白銀，（數額沒有公布）交換美元信用或黃金。並且這個協定，已經轉期過好幾决。中國白銀，從香港轉倫敦運至紐的。一九三八年上半年，收買中國銀幣的一四〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，値價美金六三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。前在一九三四年白銀法下所買中國的白銀，根據非正式估計，前後共的三〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩。</p>
<p>中國這項銀幣的現款賣買，楚開始於中日戰爭以前兩年光景，究屬多少數目，雖然沒有正式公布，大概除掉有標肥的黃金以外，都留作了銀行存款。中國就利用這筆巨大的款子，來支付國外的費用。</p>
<p>一九三叫年美國初行購銀法的時候，國庫存有黃金七，八五六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，根據新法，應有白銀二，六一九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇〇元，以一·一九元合算之，則爲二，〇一六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，當時原有白銀六九三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩（包括輔幣在內），所以應收白銀一，三三三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，然而到一九三八年六月底，金準備額已達一二，九六二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，就拿九萬萬元的代價，購買白銀一，六八七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩以後，還缺少九七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩。這當然因爲現余旣增，而應收白銀也要增加了。美國庫所收的白銀，除本國外，各國都有，但是外國白銀共計一，三五三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，而本國銀不過三三三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，其中新出鑛的占了一二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩。上述情形，就是美國購銀法對於銀價的影響。在這四年之內，全世界銀幣集中到美國去溶化的數目，超過了收買新出鑛的白銀。算來每一兩國內新出鑛的白銀，相對購買外國銀六·二兩。所以要恢復全世界複本位制的努力，結果等於頂了石臼做戲。</p>
<p>美國購銀政策的結果，不但如此，還發生下面幾種情形。</p>
<p>（一）恢復複本位制的希望，從此消滅。在美國政府顯然爲後盾時，一般作買空投機者就十二分踴躍，一旦美政府稍有退縮現象，投機者立刻停買。並且在一九三七年底倫敦白銀協定滿期的時候，其他七個國竟然沒有一個國家提議要轉期，於是本來由別國購買的白銀，也一律向美國傾銷了。</p>
<p>（二）唯一使用銀幣而向來每年購買白銀的一萬萬兩的中國，只得放棄白銀，採用管理紙幣制，反而再將歷代積存的白銀出售在世界市塲上。</p>
<p>（三）美國竭力提高銀價，竟將全世界所有存銀完全吸收。然而銀價的維持，全靠美國繼續收買，一旦購買不力，銀價就從八一分跌到四三分，其實這個四三分的價格，還是美國出來收買所以才能維持的。</p>
<p>（四）一九三八年七月一日國　報告中，普通基金內「鑄幣稅」所得四四六，〇八八，七九三元和一九三四年購銀法下所購銀條數額都沒有擴大，而在資產項下，有白銀八七〇，九四〇，三〇六兩，以每兩五五分平均價値計算，得四七九，六〇〇，一九八元。這個數目還是第一决出現，爲沒有取得「鑄幣稅」的白銀，很有討論的價値。</p>
<p>查前年上半年內，美政府曾購進口黃金値十萬萬元，而特別設法消滅牠的活動力，使牠不侵入貨幣制度，這明明曉得美國貨幣準備中根本不需要白銀。</p>
<p>所以該誌記者的結論是：「常購銀法繼續有效時期，美國白銀生產自一九三二年的二四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩增至三七年的六九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，其他國家的白銀生產的三四倍於美國的產量，大部份都售給美政府。去年上半年美國白銀進口共計二六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇兩，値價一一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。這種投資，對於美國人民有什麼利益呢？况且自從美國購銀運動開始以來，美國就從來沒有轉售的機會，每决美國要想設法售出白銀的時候，就會引起普遍的恐慌，以及世界白銀價格的崩潰，直到現在還是這樣。單講美國庫購買白銀所化的行政費用，在一九三七年度已爲二十八萬七千元了。」</p>
<p>最後又援用一八九三年美總統克萊佛蘭在國會上主張取消一八九〇年白銀購買法的理由，批評近年銀價政策的錯誤，他說：「美國人民，應有健全穩定的幣制，並且應該爲各種匯兌和各處市塲所公認。政府決沒有權利可以耀行金融試騐，違反其他文明國家的政策和習慣，以致損害人民的利益國也沒有地位，可以利用吾人物質上富厚的能力，而危害人民貨幣的健全。」在本年初的美國國會上，白銀反對派又把這抨擊有力地運用。可可見美國這次銀政策的變更，顯然不僅是具有外交作用這一端了。美國銀政策的放棄，果已勢所必然；但步驟上還不得不充分　愼，一方仍維持國內產　的收買價於較高水準，他方又徐徐降低海外白銀的收買價，這是唯恐銀價一落千丈罷了！</p>
<h3>半年來上海經濟之回顧（續完）</h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>半年來之商品界</p>
<p>回顧過去半年來之上海商品市塲，顯呈一大危機，即某方已在展開其壟斷與操縱之手段是，商人不察，不共謀聯合抗禦，而唯私利是爭，終於任人壟斷成功，各貨乃先後出乎情理而暴漲。</p>
<p>個中原因：不外乎上海租界區內，僅有若干輕工業及農產加工業之生產設備，淪陷區內之加工業生產，早在某某方手中運轉；生產總量，遠較租界區內爲大。故在供給市塲上，本身已具壟斷之力，况所有農產及原料，租界區內絕無坐產，全部仰給於內地及海外之進口，某方旣用武力控制淪陷區內之物產的分配，復利用其對於各地交通機關之把持與交通綫之控制；於是淪陷區內之物產運滬，莫不受某方之所欲，意處理：沿途勒索也，截留自用也，絕對不准運滬也，非向彼等手中購用不可也；於是上海商品市塲之佻給來漲，時斷時績；運滬費用，亦節節高漲。設上海商品市價有節制性，無自由仲縮之餘地。並亦採聯合購買政策以對峙，則尚能阻遏某方之任意要挾與苛索，但各業中人，眛於此理，不此之圖，而唯爭先購囤以期居奇，於是入其殼中，半年來，紗花暴漲於先，豆油暴漲於後，繼之絲蘭沸騰，終及限價中之米市，魔手所至，各價即起空前未有之漲風，論者每誤認爲受外匯之間接影響，實則魔手之操縱，遠較匯價之影響爲鉅。</p>
<p>過去半年來上海商品價之漲風（單位國幣元）</p>
<p>（註）上列各貨所選之標準品（一）紗（二十支雙馬牌）；（二）花（火機花）；（三）米（各級白粳）；（四）粉（二號綠船）；（五）豆（大連元豆）；（六）豆油（大連油）；（七）餅（大連餅）；絲（係八十分以上，二〇／二二條分）。除六月份係全月中之最高低價外，餘皆全月平均。惟絲係各月中句之平均：</p>
<p>至於進口品方面，隨匯價之下降，自亦在相反增漲。此種漲度，與匯價降落率大致相等。就整個國民經濟言，進口物價之高漲，有自然抑制進口之效；惟必需能以自給或代用爲條件。國民之厲行節的，固可補上項條件不足時之困難。但節的有一定限度，吾則，在民困增加之另一面，亦足以削弱社會經濟之活力。惟中國之進口貨內，除少數絕對必需品外，餘皆屬不急不需或國內有所替代之物。惜在民間以歐化爲榮，致成主要之入口，今日財部雖已實施禁止進口之策，惟法力難入滬地，其能抑制進口者，恐尚非仰賴外匯政策不可歟？</p>
<p>危機之潛伏與惡化</p>
<p>上海人口集中，職業供應有限。在物價如是激昂，顯然足以威脅整個社會經濟之繁榮。昔日可漲者，尚以進口品及生活决要品，故一般市民，尚能各就可能，以節的苟延殘喘。試就中國統計學社所編之上海工人生活費指數觀之：則今昨兩年上半期內之生活負担，巳較前增加至鉅。有如次列：</p>
<p>但五月以來，食料費急劇飛漲。此項消費節的，至爲有限，除撙節他種消耗費以爲維持民食外，別無他法。有之：唯有增加彼等之收入。果然：則一般物價更度抬漲；不然，則一般市塲將亦因大衆購買力之下降而萎縮，殆無疑義。此爲潛伏於上海經濟的危機之一。</p>
<p>今日上海固在所謂「戰時景氣」時期，致此之道：人口增加一也；戰事遠離上海而在地理上已逐漸恢復其集散之地位二也；租界區內小規模生產隨市塲需要而發展三也；四郊各地生產設備之毀滅與生產减退四也；游資充斥，投機旺盛，不勞利得收入增加而縱情消費五也；滙價下落，物價上昇，刺激一般商業之操作六也。然其主要理由，尚在人可激增，與對內交通關係之維持兩者，不幸此兩大條件，現已有所變化。滬地人口固猶未减？但其增加，業已停止。是以木市之市塲需要，無形中已有限制，加以物價超乎購買力而上漲，益在削减市塲需要之程度。此其一，邇來日軍對於封鎖中國各地海可之戰略，正在變更加厲而力行中，內銷門戶一絕，上海巿塲勢必陷入柘竭之狀。此其二。淪陷區內物產之運滬，已受某方壟斷，淪陷區內之生產設備從先後在日方手中復活，此皆足以大大打擊上海租界區內之生產，以及增大租界區對淪陷區之貿易逆勢。此其三。此等打擊，有其一，已足束縛上海經濟而使之不能繼續活路矣。況已三端並發，而平民生計從因糧價狂漲而不安，故上海經濟之今日「景氣」，恐已瀕最危急之關頭矣。</p>
<h3>戰前戰後的上海工業（續完）</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>這裏把全上海工業所遭受戰事的損失，根據各同業公會的報告：「（一）紡織廠，華商所辦三十家，其中七廠，始終工作，所餘二十三家，損失輕重不等。（一）染坊，大小共十九家，於戰時被燬。（三）針織廠，共五十家，有十五家被燬。（四）繅絲廠，除在防綫內之四家外，殆全數被燬。（五）絲織廠，的有叫百家，被燬者的三百家。（六）化學品廠，大規模工廠被燬者的九家。（七）肥皂廠，大規模的六家，完全被燬，（八）紙廠，僅四家開工，五家完全被燬，十五家遭受不等之重大損害。（九）印刷廠，有最大兩家，毀損綦重，小規模印刷廠被燬者，的共二百家。（十）烟草廠，共十八家，其中八家完全被燬。（十一）麵粉廠，共有十五家，被燬者八家。（十二）木廠，共有二十二家，非被毀壞，即受損繁重。（十三）機器廠，有大規模之造船廠，機器廠，　廠，印刷機器製造廠，科學儀器廠各一家，均受損奇重；小規模之廠，全被燬者，數以百計。（十四）橡膠廠，共三十五家，其能復業者僅六家。（十五）玻璃廠，共二十六家，被燬者的佔半數。此外尚有日常用品製造廠若干家，包括製造罐頭，教育用品，麻綫及其貨物之公司在內，亦均被燬。」（見五月一日大英夜報所載）統計其損失，有估計四五萬萬元，有估計八萬萬至四十萬萬元。但精確數字，到現在還不能確定。不過，戰後上海的工業所受到的損失，誰也不會吾認是不重大呢。</p>
<p>雖然，上海的工業，在戰後受到重大的破壞和損失，但不久即漸呈活躍的姿態而出現了。而至去年下半年，更有迅速的進展。</p>

<h3>英督謁暹羅王</h3>
<p>英水師提督乘戰艦埃綸竺，駛至邏羅賓角。賓角亦名邦哥，乃暹之京都也，建於湄南河濱。時海口水淺，不得入，乃以小輪船二艘，載提督及隨從各官。道經各處，見田禾茂密，甘蔗繁盛，　畝間一望碧靑，淸　徐至，襟袍皆凉。船駐泊於央領事衙門，蓋所建之署，本面海也。是日天氣炎熇，寒暑針昇至九十叫度。英領事爲之照會暹羅大官，述提督請見國王之意。時潯暑逼人，而仰瞻盛禮，例須軍服。暹羅國中居王位者有二：一曰大王，二曰二王。進時，光謁大王，彼坐於文榻，而憑玉几，二王則待坐其側。總領事導提督至前，瞻謁禮畢，大王請往偏殿，殿中陳設華麗。王坐，總領事提督列坐左右。王春秋鼎盛，年僅二十有一。二王戎服負劍，其裝束有若英國之騎兵，其職爲統領羽林伙飛之衆。有大臣年已老邁，衣以鑽石爲鈕。宮中之地，悉舖雲母，窗　皆蒙以羅綺，五色輝爛，目爲之眩。聚談旣竟，乃出聽鼓樂，音節悠揚，鏗鏘中節，因提督固携有鼓樂一班，爲之迭奏也。旋提督回舟，始脫戎服，如出火坑。翌日，叉往謂二王，其宮室之華，似爲稍遜，然氣象矞皇，亦極宏敞。越三日，二王偕一老臣至兵艦答拜，因命升桅燃砲，以示恭迎。言語之間，極爲款洽。二王細觀船上器械，甚爲悅佩！以金牌等件，饋於提督，禮意之優隆，周旋之謙遜，若忘其爲王位之尊也。</p>

<h3>原適</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>人生於世，不得不適應環境，吾則就要有「落伍」與「退化」之危險。故人欲求進步，欲求合乎時代之趨勢，非對四圍的環境一一適合不可。如能變本加厲而具「過度敏感」則更佳，蓋防息於未然，因噎而廢食，因嗆而廢飲，至不食不飲，「死而後已」，甚或杞人憂天，個個上吊，則爲適應中之上策。</p>
<p>同讀古書，古人與今人的讀法截然不同。古人讀書，以爲大丈夫「富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈」；叉以爲大丈夫「一言旣出，駟馬難追」，今人則只背得一句「大丈夫能屈能伸」，甚至疑以前兩句係後人僞造，儘可不讀，蓋今人善適也。是故在「國軍西撤環境不同」的不朽定理之下，奇形怪態，不一而足。如有人閒着無事，寫一部近代聊齋倒也是一筆好生意。舉其小者言之，則總理逝世紀念去大大的娛樂一者，以示淸高，屈也；遇人則說將來抗戰勝利當在總理遺像前多賠三個響頭，伸也。摩登靑年跳舞，溜冰，游泳，人詰之就說環境如此，屈也；還說去跳舞可習肉搏，去游泳溜冰可習水戰，而雖衝鋒於北地冰凍之區，可套上跑冰鞋一滑而下，風馳電掣，勢如破竹，伸也。能屈能伸，眞不愧爲「大丈夫」！小者如斯，大者更可想而知，母庸多說。大丈夫如此之衆，失陪！失陪！</p>
<p>然則大丈夫苟能屈而能伸，尚不愧爲大丈夫。世間最薄命的，莫過於能屈而不能仲之大丈夫了！時勢好，他們根本不知道仲；時勢壞，他們便一屈而再屈，咬緊牙關，「迎頭苦屈」；機會一來，還勸別人更學着他「屈」。他們對於環境可說適得淋漓盡致；他們屈，也可說屈得淋漓盡致。故可名之曰「屈大丈夫」，與從前的「屈大夫」幾乎同名。其實他們屈到死，的確比屈大夫的投河好得多；推其原委則因他們善適之故，怪不得達爾文老先生喟然嘆曰：「嗚呼，適者生存　」</p>
<p>翻開字典，才想到適這個字還可當「嫁」解。由「嫁」，我便無意中想到「嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗」的「嫁」字上來了。我沒有讀過說文一書，想來「適」之所以可作嫁解，也就是這句成語的關係。一個人要適應環境，便不得不捧着飯碗嫁鷄隨雞，嫁狗隨狗，一嫁之後，以前所說的話盡可聲明作廢，並可以放屁視之。國音字典「適」下第一條曰：「往也，叉女子出嫁曰適人」，可見「適」「嫁」「往」三字有同樣的意思。因此我們也就可以說：「往雞隨雞，往狗隨狗。」「往狗」自然是「往狗處」之謂。狗見衣杉襤褸者就呌而咬之，見衣服華麗者就迎而媚之，可見「往狗」也不大容易咧。</p>
<p>跋云：作者學識淺陋，遺漏之處，當所不免，但並不希望海內學者不吝賜教，蓋偶一明言，即失「適」之道矣。</p>
<h3>旦旦而伐之</h3>
<h3>到丹陽去的路上</h3>
<p>— 樂還</p>
<p>——京滬綫戰地追記——</p>
<p>是十一月的天氣，初决飄着雪，刮着風，村野間露出一片肅殺的氣象，我們一小隊迎着風雪開始向丹陽進發。</p>
<p>一路憑着鐵路兩旁高聳的電綫木做南針，踏着泥滑的小路，穿過小溪村落；沿途各自默計着在脚下會溜滑過了幾許路程；村落中不時傳來稀疎的鷄鳴聲，犬吠聲，益顯得大地還是那般平靜。</p>
<p>風越刮越大，身上穿的雖是棉衣，但單薄得像秋裝；劇烈的奔跑還抵不了寒氣的侵襲，四肢在麻木，身體在發枓，風是迎面吹來的，速度减低到每小時七里友右。</p>
<p>一步挨一步，緊閉了嘴。風勢的猛烈，時常會使你阻塞住鼻子的呼吸；每個同志都灣了腰，像掩護着衝鋒時，更像河畔的縴夫。</p>
<p>走過石橋，穿過幾株小樹，前面來了一個小村；是需要休息的時候了，全程已畢了三分之二。</p>
<p>村子裏的壯丁都出防去了，留下的祇有幾位婦女和幼小的孩子。我們踏進靠近路口的一間屋子，一個年紀的在六十光景的老太太，正倚門望着，旁邊站着兩個天眞的孩子。</p>
<p>「請問老太太，你們家裏有沒有什麽東西可以賣點給我們充充飢呀？」秘書拉着湖南官話打問，一面抖去身上的雪花。</p>
<p>「哦……」老太太翻着白眼，沒有聽懂秘書的話，這正需要我們來當臨時翻譯了。</p>
<p>「鄕下沒有好的東西，米是現成的，可是沒有菜呢！」老太太對於我們帶着一點兒當地鄕音的言語發生好感，皺了的慈祥的臉上掛上和藹的笑容</p>
<p>「飯倒不需要，而且太麻煩，最好能有現成的。因爲我們還要趕路哩！」四正很緩和的要求老太太替我們想個法子。實在我們的肚子裏所剩餘的，還是昨天晚上的東西呢！</p>
<p>「那末讓我來找找看……。」老太太開始去摸索，孩子們也幫着去翻尋。</p>
<p>「山芋……！」一個孩子擎起一隻很大的。</p>
<p>「山芋？」我喜歡得跳了起來，我對它曾愛好過長久，還在三四年前故鄕的時候；自從踏進生活圈子以後，三四年沒有問津過，想不到重嘗滋味，竟在此時此地。</p>
<p>老太太給我巨大的呼聲呆住了。</p>
<p>「就山芋吧，那很可口的東西，謝謝老太太！」</p>
<p>「可口？鄉下怎會有好東西，要是不厭，就煮了它吧！」</p>
<p>「好！就這樣做。」秘書也表示歡喜。</p>
<p>老太太在形上雖是那麽籠鍾，可是她的動作却迅速而有力，她把一根根廣　折斷了送進灶肚中去，融融地燃起。屋裏漸漸地溫熱，麻木的四肢也慢慢地舒服過來。</p>
<p>她呆望着火燄許久，把蘆　多放了一些進去，回顧我們說：「你們很辛苦吧！」火光閃爍在老太太的面上，照得十分紅潤。</p>
<p>「不，老太太，你才辛苦呢！」</p>
<p>「唉！我是老了沒有用哩！祇配坐在家裏等死……曖，這幾天風聲怎樣，該不要緊的吧！」</p>
<p>「這裏嗎？暫時不要緊。」心裏起了兩種思潮。</p>
<p>水滾了，老太太沒有問下去，立起身來，揭開鍋蓋，用筷夾着山芋，很高興的說：「快好了！」</p>
<h3>悼公孫旻</h3>
<p>— 王墳</p>
<p>—一個戲劇界的鬥士</p>
<p>偶然在報紙上看到公孫旻逝世的消息，我便不可抑遏地震愕起來。難逍就是他，就是那個以戰士的恣態出現於舞台上的公孫旻，在上海逝世了嗎？報紙上的記載，語焉不詳，祗說他傷寒復發，醫治罔效，歿於××醫院；而對於他的造詣，他的業績，他的身世，他的家况，一個字都沒有提。我懷疑那是另外一個偶然與他同名同姓的人，在醫院裏罹疾以卒；然而我又直覺地以爲這種懷疑是多餘的，我竟直覺地肯定那一定是他！上海方面的朋友，認識公孫旻的恐怕不多，也許我的朋友中，認識公孫旻的很少，所以除了報紙上的一段消息外，竟沒有聽到任何人談起過；有時問問人家，他們竟速報上的記載都不知道。一個戲劇界的鬥士，這樣寂寞地死去，實在是一件最堪悲悼的事情。我不知道上海劇壇的同志，知道這一位鬥士沒有？知道這一位鬥士的噩耗沒有？如果也有認識他的人，我相信應該好好地哀悼他一番的。</p>
<p>我和公孫旻的認識，是在一年以前。那時我在廣西桂林。每個星期日，我往往到毓棠鳳子家裏去閒談。因爲鳳子是愛好戲劇的，所以在她家裏往往可以碰到許多作家和演員。有一决我們正在跟歐陽予倩閒談，忽然來了一位穿着黑襯杉的朋友，行動急遽，一臉是興奮的神氣，鳳子含糊地把他介紹給我，知道他是第五路軍總司令部國防藝術社的演員，正在排演陽翰笙的『前夜』和歐陽予倩的『靑紗帳裏』。這兩個劇本，都有鳳子的份；而且在『前夜』中，連毓棠也參加演出呢。大概那一天下午，他們又預備排戲的，所以我先告辭了出來。隔了一個星期，我又照例上鳳子家去，在那邊看見一個早已在她家裏的客人，我一時記不起是誰，可是他却向我招呼了，這一决我才知道他叫公孫旻。而這一决，他便給了我一個深刻的印象：他有靑年的熱情，也有老年人的端莊，有詩人的敏感，也有戲劇家的心靈；他有思想，有成就，也有骨氣！我覺得像他那樣的演員，不應該僅僅以演員目之的！</p>
<p>此後，我又見過他兩三决。而這兩三决，却完全是另一副而目。那是在舞台上，那是以戰士的恣態出現的。聽了他的台詞，看了他的表演，我被深深地感動了；而且被感動的，我相信決不止我一個人。我簡直忘肥自己在看戲，也忘記他在演戲，我以爲一切的行動，一切的說話，都是每一個有血肉的中國人民所應該表現和表白的。我覺得公孫旻就是劇中的人物，而劇中的人物，就是公孫旻的人格的形象化。在藝術上，他是成功了；而在人格上，我已更進一步地瞭解他。然而因爲我一直忙着瑣屑的事務，此後竟沒有機會再看到他。及至我離開廣西，便與他更隔得遙遠了。</p>
<p>兩個多月以前，忽然有一位朋友來找我；出乎我意料之外的，那是迢迢地從廣西來滬的公孫旻。他還是那樣一副旣熱情又端莊的神氣，滔滔地述說着離桂的經過；他問我上海劇壇的情形，我慚愧沒有什麼話好說；我問他今後怎麽樣生活，他彷彿仍然預備從事文藝和戲劇的工作。他告訴我住在××路，他也抄了我的電話去，預備過後再的談，豈知這一別竟成永訣呢？我自己因爲成天忙碌着，什麽朋友都沒有空閒去拜訪；而他呢，不知也爲什麽一直沒有來我過我。及至我看到報上的記載，才知道一個月來他一直在生病，而一個月之後，他竟以傷寒復發而逝世了！這樣一個戲劇界的鬥士，不死於砲火，不死於轟炸，而死於不可醫治的傷衆，那實在是太寃屈了！</p>
<p>寫這篇短文的時候，我一直看着『良友』第一四〇期上刊載的公孫旻的劇照，那就是在桂林演出的。然而人亡影在，徒然更增我的傷悼而已！</p>
<h3>紅鬼子瓦西卡</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>她們雖然低聲的說，可是勢頭却很兇。她們圍住瓦西卡的床，以兇惡的，然而愉悅的眼光，望着他那灰色的臉孔；他也望了望她們。他的眼裏，已陘沒有那重無厭的貪慾——這是無時無刻都在他眼裏輝閃着的，莫名其妙的貧慾。</p>
<p>「你們……瞧淸……我會好的……」</p>
<p>「這是神的意思，不會好了唷……麗達打斷他。</p>
<p>瓦西卡緊閉着嘴不做聲了。</p>
<p>『那條腿痛呢？』她們中的一個俯下身去，親切地問着，她的臉孔發靑，牙齒格格的磨着，「啊，是這邊嗎？」</p>
<p>她說着便抓住瓦西卡的傷腿，使勁往身邊一拉。</p>
<p>瓦西卡咬着牙，發出呻吟，他的左手也是跌壞了的，他揮着右手想去打她，可是却打在自己的肚皮上了。</p>
<p>哄笑聲爆發在他的四週。</p>
<p>『臭東西！』他害怕似的睜開眼來暴呌，『你們留心！將來我會殺了你們的……」</p>
<p>可是她們在他床的四週來回跳着，扯他的頭髮，唾他的臉，拖他的痛脚。她們的眼睛發火。她們笑着，駡着，和犬一樣呌着。對他的咒駡都是用那惡俗不堪的言語，她們是因爲報仇報得出了神，直變成激怒了。她們把衣服都脫了，變成雪白的一羣，呌人十分害怕。</p>
<p>瓦西卡搖着右手吼呌。老鴇站在門口以粗野的聲音：怒駡起來：</p>
<p>『够啦……再動他，我會呌警察來的！你們會把他弄死的呀……天啊！天……啊！」</p>
<p>但是她們沒有聽到她的話。他已經蹂躪了她們好幾年了——她們不過一時兒報答報答，所以她們都氣吼吼的不甘罷休……</p>
<p>忽然在這喧囂和呻吟的「享受」中，起了一陣粗暴的，教訓的聲音：</p>
<p>『你們也　够了吧，……請你們憐憫一點……他也是……同樣……不是在受苦的嗎？好心的人啊，看邪穌的臉上，……好心的……』這話好像一股冷水澆在妓女們的身上，發生了效力？她們吃驚着很快的跑開了。</p>
<p>說話的是阿玖斯尼亞。她站在窗前渾身發抖，雙手捧住肚皮，可笑地把身子仲向前面，深深的向她們鞠躬。</p>
<p>瓦西卡已睡熟了。他那胸上的襯衣給撕碎了，長着密密的紅毛的廣闊的胸膛迫促的跳着，——好像急流湍激着似的。</p>
<p>咕嚕咕嚕的嚮着喉頭。閉着眼。　（九）</p>
<h3>喜樂（一）</h3>
<p>喜樂的人，社會上並不多見，也可以說永遠不會見。因為社會上所見的，都是苦毒，惱恨，嫉妒，紛爭，怨懟，謗　，仇恨、兇殺，慘痛的景象，那裏能有喜樂的人呢？</p>
<p>有人說上海的社會，是喜樂社會，影戲院，跳舞聽，評劇，雜曲。鼓詞，賭場，煙館，以及新興的俱樂部，各處人滿爲患，不都是歡　跳躍，擁擁擠擠的喜樂的人嗎。我說，唉！這是苦悶的反應，那裏有喜樂呢。共中的人，渾渾噩噩的，根本談不到憂喜，若　有理　的，莫不愁雲慘霧，如入人間地獄；一旦　落，無力自拔，眞是欲哭無淚，又從裏得　喜樂呢？</p>
<p>我所說的喜樂，不但不包括這種下等娛樂，就是最上上等物質享受，最高超的陶情適性，都不包括在內。這兩等人，或者偶有淺嘗的喜樂，然而並非喜樂之眞而大者，故亦不得爲喜樂、我所說的喜樂，乃至眞至的喜樂。環境萬變，喜樂不變，人事無常，喜樂有常。其喜樂發自性靈的深處，別人不能抑制，自已不能遏止，洋溢活潑，自然流露。使接近的人，都能感覺但和鳳甘雨，光天化日的快活。惟有眞信主耶穌者為然。此等大喜樂，人人能實施經驗，卻不能以筆墨形容萬一。上海基督教文字　道會郵　一二二七號</p>

<h3>滙劃票據清償效力之透視</h3>
<p>— 丁裕長</p>
<p>昨讀俞詠華君作「書財部馬電限制提款辦法後一文，有云：「獨就法律方面觀察，前之安定金融辦法，能行之於內地，歷久而無礙，何獨於上海竟漸失效用，而必藉財部新近之馬電，再度限制以爲補救，是不得不歸咎於銀錢業聯準會之公訂匯劃行市，與法院之裁判不認匯劃票據有法償效力，有以致之。」此於上海銀行同業聯合準備會及法院對於安定金融之國策，不能深切了解而切實遵行，深致慨嘆。春秋責備賢者，其立論殊爲允當。雖然，上海環境特殊，政府於戰時推行國策，時多阻礙，固不僅劃票一事而已。此中　結，要在我國法權在上海未能保持完整耳。</p>
<p>自我國施行法幣政策後，法幣即爲唯一之通貨，爲法律及事實所確認。迨「八一三」事件後，政府施行「安定金融辦法」限制提存；在上海並由銀錢通用匯劃票據，其作用防止資金逃避及縮減法幣之流通額，免爲日僞利用，套取外匯，匯劃原具票據之形式，而爲法幣之補充通貨，銀錢業以之支付法幣存款，依法與法幣有同一之清償效力，並無軒輊。而其不能兌換法幣，如一般票據者，固爲政府法令所確認，亦即發揮其防止資金逃避及減縮法幣流通額之作用也。然以戰局延長，二十星期之時間，早已消逝，即每星期限取百分之五之存款，亦可提取淨盡。且自去歲三月，政府實施統制外匯，頒行「外匯請核規則，」外匯之賣買，依法律言，應集中於中央銀行。「國家拒絕供給之外匯，轉以謀諸黑匯市塲者皆不得調爲正常。」特以租界制度存在，外商銀行林立，資金逃避，早有坦途可循。重以戰事西移，上海之爲我國金融中心，又無動搖之象，故內地對外貿易，均以上海爲最後之清算地點。入超激增，爲我國國際貿易之經常現象，政府於國策上及事實上均不能與上海外匯市塲以滿足，亦屬不可諱言。於是有外匯黑市之發生。此非法的外匯黑市，法幣即可在「外匯請核規則」外，自由買入外匯。匯劃票據則不能於黑市換取外匯，必須兌成法幣而後可。以此，匯劃票據之清償效力，遂不免發生動搖。亦即滙劃發生貼水之主要原因。如外匯無黑市，法幣非依「外匯請核規則」申請中央銀行核准以外，不能取得外匯，則匯劃票據之持有人何必貼水，而換取法幣。各業對於匯劃，何必存歧視之心理？而匯劃與法幣有保持其同一之清償效力，何至發生問題？然則政府有權取消外匯黑市乎？無人能肯定答復此問題。故匯劃票據之被否認與法幣有同　清償效力，形式上雖爲法院之判決，實質上係非法的外滙黑市也。外匯黑市既不能依法取締，即使法院判決，仍維持匯劃有清償效力，事實上徒滋糾紛。充其極，不過由法律問題，轉化爲外交問題耳。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，銀準會公佈滙劃行市，當時係受國家銀行之委託，且爲顧全一般正當商業起見。蓋當匯劃貼水，繼續高翔，投機操縱，積重難返，如國家銀行不授權與銀準會，而平準匯劃之貼現率，則匯劃與法幣之作格，相差更遠，益授投機家以利益。且政府對於上海金融，雖煞費苦心，力謀安定，而以環境特殊，法權未能完整，致其措施，亦難貫澈。如「八一三」後之「安定金融辦法」既已確認匯劃票據可以支付法幣存款，則對於匯劃之清償效力，在此法未失效前，應予保持，何以最近報載，自七月四日起，中中交農四國家銀行對於銀錢業之滙劃存款二千二百萬元，衹允換給百分之九十五之法幣？是則匯劃票據無法幣同一之清償效力，不僅爲法院所判決，抑且爲政府所確認。政府之措施，前後矛盾若此，則匯劃票據之清償效力，烏能保持乎？</p>
<p>總之，上海環境特殊，金融業之富有殖民地性，尤以今日孤島時代爲尤甚。政府根據國策，而頒行戰時安定金融之法規，每因法權之不完整，時有扞格難行之苦，甚或呈畸形之現象。滙劃票據之清償效力，初爲法令所確認，繼爲法院及政府所否認，亦此畸形現象之　端。即最近政府對於外匯之措施，修正「外匯請核規則」爲「進口物品申請外滙規則，」以及頒行「禁止進口物品辦法」等，謂非受上海非法的外匯黑市之影響，不可得也。而上海法權未能完整保持，即爲構成特殊環境之重要因素也。</p>

<h3>自訴與被害人之關係（續）</h3>
<p>— 穆緯均</p>
<p>被害人如何利用自訴程序</p>
<p>凡一刑事案件，具備上述積極消極要件時，被害人固得提起自訴而請求提起公訴，亦屬合法。故在具備自訴要件情形之下，提起自訴或告訴請求提起公訴，可任被害人選擇爲之。自訴程序，雖爲保護個人之法益而設，然自訴程序，對於被害人究有何等利益，爲一般人民所不注意，故往往被害人對於合自訴要件之犯罪，亦僅告訴請求提起公訴，而不知利用自訴程序。茲將自訴程序對於被害人之利益略述如左：</p>
<p>如被害人願採公訴程序，則向檢察官或司法警察官（上海租界向捕房）告訴即可，在手續方面雖較自訴爲簡單，然依刑事訴訟法第三一五條之規定，「同一案件經檢察官終結偵查者，不得再行自訴。」則告訴後，經檢察官偵查終結，不問其結果起訴與否，被害人即喪失自訴權，且依刑事訴訟法第二三二條之規定，「檢察官於刑法第六一條年列各罪之案件，參酌刑法第五七條所列事項，認爲以不起訴爲適當者，得爲不起訴之處分。」若安伯經偵查終結而不起訴，被害人（原告訴人）依刑事訴訟法第二三五條僅得於接受不起訴處分書後，七日內以書狀叙述不服之理由，經由原檢察官，向直接上級法院首席檢察官或檢察長，聲請再議，別無救濟方法也。</p>
<p>依刑事訴訟法第三三六條之規定，「當事人對於下級法院之判決有不服者，得上訴訟於上級法院。」此處所謂當事人，依同法第三條之規定，係指檢察官，自訴人，及被告而言。故檢察官，自訴人，及被告，皆得爲上訴之主體；但因公訴與自訴之當事人不同，以致上訴之主體有別。公訴程序中之當事人爲檢察官及被告，故有上訴權者，亦爲檢察官與被告：被害人既非公訴之當事人，則當然無上訴之權。如被害人爲原告訴人時，雖得請求檢察官上訴，然准許與否，檢察民有酌量之權，決不受其拘束。在自訴程序中，當事人爲自訴人與被告，有上訴權者，亦爲自訴人與被告；故爲自訴之被害人，對於自訴案件之判決，如有不服，依法得爲上訴。</p>
<p>依刑事訴訟法第四九一條之規定，「因犯罪而受損害之人於刑事訴訟程序得附帶提起民事訴訟，對於被告及依民法負賠償責任之人，請求回復其損害。則被害人如因犯罪而受損害時，不問在自訴或公訴程序中，均得依同法第四九二條於刑事訴訟起訴後，第二審辯論終結前，提起附帶民事訴訟。如被害人告訴請求提起公訴而經檢察官偵查終結，不起訴時，被害人依法僅得請求再議，而不得再行自訴，已如前述；如再議這結果仍爲不起訴時，該因犯罪而受損害之被害人，僅能繳納訟費另向民庭提起附帶民事訴訟矣。蓋提起附帶民事訴訟，依法必在刑事訴訟起訴後，始合於附帶之性質也。</p>
<p>依刑事訴訟法第五〇七第二項之規定，「因刑事訴訟論知無罪，免訴，或不受理之判決，致附帶民事訴訟受駁回之判決者，非對於刑事訴訟之判決有上訴時，不得上訴」。在公訴程序中被害人既非刑事訴訟之當事人，依法不得爲上訴之主體已如前述；如檢察官對於刑事訴訟之判決不爲上訴時，則被害人雖不服駁回附帶民事訴訟之判決，然亦不得單獨上訴矣。</p>
<p>自訴與被害人之關係既如上述，則被害人於有可以利用自訴程序之情形時，當知所趨從矣。（完）</p>

<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（問）甲男與乙女（均已成年）兩願結婚，乙女家長反對，且言倘與甲結婚，決欲說離此女。今甲乙　參加集團結婚，但定章須雙方家長蓋印，乃乙女家長既反對，勢難蓋印，因有下列疑問：（一）倘甲因婚姻而私刻乙女家長圖章，蓋證書上，（甲方蓋印無問題）此證書有效否？（二）若乙女家長偵知此事，訴甲私刻圖章，依法可減輕或無罪否？（三）乙女因此觸怒家長，甚至被家長登報，或用其他方法聲明脫離，此種情形，依法有何規定？　乙女果被家長脫離，對於將來之遺產承繼權，能否存在？（高驥）</p>
<p>（答）（一）甲私刻乙女家長印章，蓋用於與乙結婚之證書，其證書並非全部無效。（二）甲僞造印章如是生損害於公眾或他人，應負刑法第二百十七條第一項之罪責。（三）父母子女之關係，基於血統而發生，並非法律行爲所可脫離；惟家長如有正當理由，依民法第一一二八條之規定，得令其家屬由家分離。四）乙是否喪失繼承權，應以有無民法第一一四五條第一項各款所列之情形爲斷。總之乙既已成年，婚姻原可自主，而結婚證書，又非法律上必備之要件，甲實不必僞造印章，致蹈法網。（璜）</p>

<p>（問）甲有子女各一，子已婚，女已嫁，甲於四年前去世，遺有鉅額財產，其子於二年前，依據遺囑，衹分給其妹。（即女）洋二百元。（一）現女可否向其兄要求分析遺產，（二）何種情形視爲民法第一一四六條之侵害繼承權。（張立夫）</p>
<p>（答）（一）如未失時效自可要求。（二）其情形有種種之不同，凡應繼承而未得繼承者皆是。（吳光鼎）</p>

<h3>「連環圖畫」的演變</h3>
<p>— （鈞相）</p>
<p>三四十年來的「連環圖畫」　專向讀者灌輸濃烈的毒液</p>
<p>「連環圖畫」一名「人書」，亦稱「小書」。它之所以能够盛行了三四十年，爲一般小市民及孩子們歡迎的緣故，一是因爲「連環圖畫」的畫意淺顯，文字部份至少也要比「章回小說」中的淺明得多，易於使道班未受過高深教育的平民大衆充分瞭解；二是「連環圖畫」的租價便宜，適合於普通平民的經濟力。此外，大多數的「連環圖畫」的內容中充滿各式各樣的「低級趣味」，自然其號召力也是頗大的。</p>
<p>初期的「連環圖畫」，不論共形式或是內容都較後來的差得遠：它是不火有連續性的，大多以「章回小說」的一回畫圖畫兩幅，支離分散，看不出整個故事的發展，演變；中的人物也畫得極粗俗，簡單；沒有背景，也沒有說明。紙張是用油光紙的，印刷也極差。</p>
<p>之後，「連環圖畫」開始漸漸地進步了，首先，「連環圖畫」的作者們爲了使圖畫更有趣，生動起見，將「連環圖　」中的故事內容貫連起來，使閱者對於整個故事的輪廓得到一個淸楚的梗槪。其次是在每幅圖畫之上另闢一個「說明欄」，說明有時用作爲畫圖根據的原文，有時由作者們自己寫下一個大意。每幅圖畫上則進一步的添加了適合於故事轉變的背景，畫人物的技藝也較初期高明得多，不過紙張依然是油光的，印刷自然也沒有進步。</p>
<p>時至最近，「連環圖畫」在形式上算是大大的進步了，它的紙張已由有害目光的油光紙改用報紙了；畫圖較過去的更爲精緻，更合藝術化；說明也由作者們把它改成更淺明，通俗，易於使大衆充分瞭解。</p>
<p>在形式上講來，「連環圖畫」的確是在不斷的進步着；可是，我們檢討起這三四十年來的「連環圖畫」中的故事內容的演變狀况，實在是未許我們樂觀。</p>
<p>初期的「連環圖畫」，它的故事內容是不貫連的，考究一點的，每一章回畫圖兩幅，簡單的，大多選一則故事中最精彩，最為人熟知的幾段畫圖數幅，因此一則頗長的故事，只能盡成薄薄的一小本。作者自己是沒有創作的，作爲畫圖根據的是明淸小說家們留下的幾部通俗小說，其中間或也有依據於皮簧戲的。</p>
<p>第二時期的「連環圖畫」，故事雖然是貫連了，但作爲畫圖根據的仍舊是幾部通俗的章回小說；雖然以上海社會作題材的「閻瑞生」，「蔣老五殉情記」之類的較新鮮的作品也未始沒有。</p>
<p>在那一個時期裏，劍伙的小說，劍俠的電影曾經大盛過，「迎環岡畫」的作者們看透了人們對於這種超人的英雄—劍俠的崇拜心理，於是杜撰了很多的劍伙的「連環圖畫」，獲取了一大羣的中下流的平民讀者，注灌了濃烈的毒液。</p>
<p>直到現在，劍伙的「連環圖畫」在攤子上仍舊可以佔到三分之二的地位，這實在是「連環圖畫史」上最可悲的一點</p>
<p>產生電影寫真</p>
<p>以通俗小說爲題村的「連環圖畫」因了大衆對它們漸漸不發生興趣的緣故，差不多將要銷聲匿跡了，代售這三分之一地位的是「電影寫眞」。</p>
<p>「電影寫眞」的產生，還是在這最近的兩三年內。它居然也號召得很多的讀者，有許多看不起電影的平民，他們都藉「電影寫眞」看到每一部影片中的內容；現在差不多每一部影片開映後的半個月內就有「電影寫眞」的「連環圖畫」出版了</p>
<p>至於「連環圖畫」的作者們自己創作出來的切合於目今時代的連環圖畫，在目前可以說是鳳毛麟角，絕對的少數，我只看到過一部以上海難民圈作題材的「難民淚」。</p>
<p>以上是關於三四十年來的「連環圖畫」演變狀况的一個小小的報告。嚴格的講，三四十年來的「連環圖畫」，它非但沒有担負起教育大衆的任務，相反地，它爲了替銷路着想，帶給大衆各種濃烈的毒液，——我們不是看到很多純潔天眞的孩子，看了圖上劍俠的各種形態，着了迷，想跑到什麼山，什麼洞去找那些劍仙？在抗戰進入第二階級的現在，「連環圖畫」非但沒有跟抗戰配合起來，而且加倍的在麻醉着大衆</p>
<p>據說，一部份前進的畫家們，正在開始利用「連環圖畫」，使它跟抗戰配合起來，作爲教育大衆的一種有力的工具，我希望他們在最近就做出一點良好的成績來，作爲一個榜樣！</p>

<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行　　到後來，　合作商店益觀　展了。人家的日用必需之品，都要向合作商店去取，合作商店要供人家的需要，所備的貨物，也愈加增多了。那一年年底，朱愛立把商店裏出售的貨品，計算一下，却有三百四上五種。他笑着說道：「人家向來對於都市間那種大雜貨店，稱之篇百貨商店。具實何止是百種，只我們這個小小合作商店，已經有了貨品三百餘種。因爲我們這裏，有許多東西是沒有的。不然，稍爲再寬放一下，就是一千種貨物，立刻愛爲千貨商店呢。」原來他們起初開辦這合作商店時，定下一條章程，是不　奢侈品。而且最先規定的，是一塊錢以上的貨物不出售，這也不但是因爲不賣者侈品的緣故，也是因爲資本實在太小。倘然要出售幾塊錢以上的貨物，只要幾十件貨品一取，就咬週轉不靈了。後來資本加到一千元以後，放寬到兩塊錢以上的貨品不售。實在合作商店內，奢侈品早便不備。譬如襪子部裏，他們只備紗襪綫　，不備絲襪。肥皂部份裏，只備洗衣肥皂，浴身肥皂，藥水肥皂等等，而高價的百花香料肥皂就不備。其他如化妝品部，有幾項必不可少的婦女用品，也是有的。什麽幾塊錢一瓶的香水，還有新奇豔麗的妝品，尤其就外國的舶來品，一槪禁止出售。香烟起初不賣的，後來也賣了，因爲香烟近來歸國家統制，成了國營事業，已屬於公賣的了。這個合作商店，逐漸擴展，一千元資本又不敷了。但後來成了一個慣例，凡是住居於自由村的村民，人人都要人股，人人都變爲合作商店的股東。就是由別處遷移到自由村來的，也就要入股，作爲合作商店的一份子，方司享受這個合作的權利。凡是合作商店的股東，每人給他一個摺子，倘然要取什麽貨品的，憑摺支取，每到月底結賬。不過所取貨物，不得超越他的股本—元以外，但預先有將款項存在合作商店者，不在此限。每半年工未，結一决賬，所有盈餘，除開消以外，分派於各股東。這種消費合作社，現在中國已設立了不少，妙在顧客就是店主，店主就是顧客，一而二，二而一者也。（一五九）</p>
<h3>銀錢業業餘聯會主辦　海上名家扇面展覽會</h3>
<p>— 瑩</p>
<p>集海上藝苑名流傑作於一堂</p>
<p>銀錢業業餘聯誼會，這個名字，對於我們不該生疏吧！從銀行錢莊的茶役，信差，老司務，練習生，到經理，行長；從難民收容所嗷嗷待哺的難民到主持救難工作的熱心人士，以至一切會爲難民慷慨輸捐的人們，沒有不知道這一個團體的。</p>
<p>原因是很簡單而鮮明的：</p>
<p>由於她是令融界中從同人自身發展起來的一個唯一的大集團。過去如此，現在如此，將來更將繼續如此，她爲上海金融業從業員的工作效能，學識修養，業餘生活，和福利事業努力不懈地推動着；同時，她也從來沒有忘記時代所賦予的使命，允共是在目前上海所應担負起來的救難工作。用球類比賽，用話劇公演，用會員最高的工作熱　，用同人煞費苦心的薄思，從過去到現在，她一直站在救難的最前綫，不斷地爲難胞呼籲請命。</p>
<p>最近，她又來主辦一次海上名流扇面展覽會了。</p>
<p>山於環境的關係，本來想將所得的作品售價，提成的或全部的作爲義賣救難的宗旨？已被取消了。只好改作用來充實該會學術委員會書畫金石班及圖書館經費和添置福利委員會同人醫藥衛生設備的費用。</p>
<p>因此，這次「海上名家扇而展覽會」，和尋常扇面展覽不同，舉凡目前海上鼎鼎大名的藝苑中第一流聖手，如吳湖帆，吳待伙，秦淸會，湯定之，馮超然，趙叔孺，徐邦達，等諸位先生的傑作，還有銀錢界的畫畫大家如潘子爕，葉元卿，陳子受，等諸先生的最近佳品，無不在積極徵求之中。（因爲名家甚多，不能備舉）這裏，還得開帶地說一句的便是：那些也許被疏忽遺忘了去徵求的作家，和些對書畫有緣的人，聯誼會方面也同樣期待着他們能將自己的和收藏的作品踴躍地陳列到這次展覽會裏來</p>
<p>預定的徵求扇面目標是一千頁，展覽地點是南京路三三四號聯誼會會所。展覽日期是七月二十三日—三十一日。時日是愈過愈近了，這幾天，聯誼會裏，不僅該會學術委員會和福利委員會所有的工作人員，如這决扇面展覽會全部動員起來，積極進行工作。即使該會名譽理事，如徐寄廎，吳蘊齋，朱博泉，林康侯，裴雲卿幾位金融界前輩，對這次扇面展覽會也異常關懷熱心，除擔任贊助人外，還每人担承書繪扇面二頁，使這决展覽會更無形生色不少。</p>
<p>等着吧：一切愛好藝術的人們，一切願意在酷熱的暑天中取得一頁優美的扇面的人們，這决海上名家扇面展覽會是會給你們一個十二分滿意的收獲的！（却酬）</p>
<h3>力士豔婦</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Winner　Take　All”</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>「力士豔婦」是描寫美國那些經營拳擊業的商人，怎樣投機取巧，把拳擊師曚在鼓里，而替他們作歛錢的工具。這樣的題材自然不是「力士豔婦」始了。但是在「力　豔婦」中有更使我們注意的一點，就是那位拳擊家史緹夫在成名以後，不自約束，驕傲而放蕩，殊不知自己的前途將在一刹那間，完全毀滅。因之，使我想到最近風傳有許多電影從業員，到滬西「歹土」去賭博，因大負之後，而行爲不檢，被公司當局撤職。這「風傳」或許確是「空穴來風」，但亦不無「蛛絲馬路」可尋，我們姑且不談別的，而用自己的手來毀滅自己的前途，已經是多末可怕的冒險呢！</p>
<p>在演出上，木片的導演者也能刪除冗塲，而使全片順利地發展下去。在三决拳擊塲面上，他吏緊緊地抓住當時緊張的空氣，而把各個人物不同的情緒分析開來。第一次：史緹夫代替波萊出塲，不被衆人注意，祇有，甘比尼高興若在，當他擊　的時候，連經營拳擊業的華爾克也驚駭起來。第二决：當史緹夫被擊敗的時候，導演者同時寫甘比尼輸錢後的悵然，及姝麗的悲痛及慚愧。第三次：在各方如醉若狂的情況下，史　夫大獲勝利。這三次不同的拳擊塲的空氣，導演者的處理手腕確實是十分高强的。</p>
<p>寫甘比尼這人物也成功。他頭腦簡單，感情容易衝動，在每一個動作上都明顯地勾劃出了他的性格。自然，演這個角色的亨萊阿米泰，也是個優秀的演員。</p>
<p>演史緹夫的湯尼馬丁稱職而已。不久前到過上海的葛露麗史都華，她飾姝麗，戲平平。</p>
<h3>國光藝刊中之顏魯公書</h3>
<p>— 吳湖帆</p>
<p>蘇東坡嘗曰：「至顏魯公，天下之能事畢矣。」顏書之爲昔賢推重也如此，稚子入塾，塾師教之學書，必取顏仰（公權），而顏多於柳，共爲天下後世矜式也又如此，蓋魯公書豐偉　勁，端正沈雄，一掃六朝初唐織媚穠麗之習，歸之渾樸，如少陵之詩，昌黎之文，皆宜爲百代宗匠也，傳世有墨爲多，眞跡寥寥可數，僕所寓目者，行草則祭姪季明文，瀛洲帖，正書則自書誥身，與竹由堂連句耳，季明文今在故宮，瀛洲在李氏，誥身在溥氏，並不易再見，竹山連句册，前藏番　葉氏，今歸吳興張君時鑒玩，其書古奧特甚，雄偉獨絕，猶出酷身上也，質而不野，肆而　　，巍巍乎商周鼎　重器，以視二王虞　，尚嫌徒趁姿媚耳。</p>
<p>徐子邦達，近有國光藝刋之輯，悉取前代金石書畫之跡，影印流傳，以宣揚美術藝文，意至善也，初期首頁，即弃魯公竹山眞跡，知所擇材哉，昔者張氏秘笈獨珍，今則藝林奇文共賞，其功允不可沒也，因爲記。</p>

<h3>East Jin Experiences Fierce Battle of One Day and Night, Japanese Troops Invading Liaoxian Are Completely Repulsed, Southern Hubei Chinese Troops Recapture Tongshan and Advance Northwest, Fierce Battle Between Jiangmen and Xinhui Continues with Japanese Troops Suffering a Crushing Defeat, Chinese Troops Briefly Charge into Chao'an City and Anbu Township</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese troops attacking Southeast Jin in nine routes are being encircled and annihilated by the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops have suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese troops advancing towards Liaoxian, East Jin, from the Zhengtai Railway have been repulsed by the Chinese troops after a day and night of counter-offensive and fierce battle. Liaoxian has also been recaptured by the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops advancing along the Baijin Highway have reached Qin County. The Chinese troops in that area are retreating eastward to lure them deeper. The battles in the areas of Liyuan and Wuxiang are unfolding fiercely. The Japanese troops advancing eastward from Pingyao are now suffering heavy blows from the Chinese troops north of Qinyuan. The Japanese troops in Anze are also advancing towards Qinyuan to coordinate with the Japanese troops advancing from Pingyao. Currently, the Japanese troops are still continuously reinforcing their forces, so there will be even greater battles within two or three days. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Pingjiang The Chinese troops' offensive in Southern Hubei is progressing smoothly. They recaptured Tongshan on the evening of the 12th and advanced to Wanshou Bridge and Ma'anshan north of Tongshan on the morning of the 13th. That evening, they further occupied Xizhang Bridge, six or seven kilometers northwest of Tongshan, killing and wounding more than fifty Japanese soldiers. They are currently continuing to pursue the Japanese troops retreating northward. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) There are currently no battles along the coast of Zhongshan. Many farmers have returned to their villages to harvest crops. The Jianghui Line is still experiencing fierce battles, and the Chinese troops are continuously winning victories. It is rumored that the Japanese side abandoned Huimen yesterday, but this has yet to be confirmed. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan After the Chinese counter-attacking troops recaptured Tuopu Township at You time (5-7 PM) on the 14th, they immediately divided their forces to the west of Anbu and attacked Chao'an from the north and south. The battle with the Japanese troops was extremely fierce. The Chinese troops once bravely charged into the South Gate of Chao'an and Anbu Township, killing and wounding more than two hundred Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, the Japanese troops reinforced with more than two thousand troops and concentrated artillery fire to bombard fiercely. To avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese troops withdrew to a certain position on the morning of the 15th. Tuopei Township is currently still firmly held by the Chinese troops. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports, the Chinese troops in Northern Jin made progress in their operations yesterday. The three most tense areas are: The Japanese troops are launching a large-scale offensive against Tongguan, using tanks and heavy artillery for attacks, and aircraft are also assisting in the atrocities, creating a formidable force. However, the Chinese troops are calmly responding to the battle, guarding key passes, and fighting bravely. Military figures in Chongqing are paying close attention to the battle situation at Tongguan. (Haitong Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tongguan More than ten thousand Japanese troops who fell into Qinshui and Zhangma Zhongcun (Southeast Yicheng) and other places, started a bloody battle with the Chinese troops in the area of Dangdian Town, east of Qinshui, from the 10th. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese corpses covered the field after being ambushed by the Chinese troops. Most of them have been defeated, and more than a thousand remaining Japanese troops are being encircled and annihilated. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) More than seven thousand Japanese troops who invaded east along the Yi-Qin Highway and more than four thousand Japanese troops who invaded south of Fushan, after falling into Qinshui on the 8th, were ambushed by a certain Chinese unit in the rain on the 9th, 10th and 11th, and the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. They are still near the outskirts of the city, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese troops. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese telegrams received here today, Chinese troops attacked several locations on the Chao-Shan Railway on July 14th. On the same day, a Chinese troop stormed into Chaozhou City and engaged in street fighting with Japanese troops. It is also reported that Chinese troops have recovered three stations. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Miluo Chinese troops on the north bank of the Xinqiang River have dispatched teams in the past two days to launch night attacks on Japanese troops in the southeast of Yueyang, Xitang, Wujiang Bridge, and Wujiashan, and have made gains. Wujiashan has indeed been recovered by the Chinese troops. This mountain is an important barrier south of Matang. Now that it is in Chinese hands, Matang is under Chinese control. The Japanese troops, suffering this unexpected blow, are extremely panicked and are stubbornly resisting in their strongholds. Chinese troops are using artillery to carry out destructive fire. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang On the 14th, Chinese troops launched a large-scale counter-offensive against Japanese troops in Tuopu, Sangpu, and Anbu. That evening, Chinese troops recaptured Fuyang. Another Chinese troop attacked Japanese troops in Xihu, Bamanan, and Yunbu Township in Chao'an via Qiaoxi and are still engaged in fierce battles. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo On the morning of the 13th, Chinese troops launched attacks on Japanese troops in Wanshou Bridge, Ma'anshan and other places in several routes, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese troops. After several hours of charging and killing, countless Japanese soldiers were killed. By noon, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed. The Japanese positions in the Wanshou Bridge and Ma'anshan area were all recovered by the Chinese troops. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang The Chinese troops pursuing northward from Tongshan across Xigang Bridge are progressing rapidly. On the evening of the 15th, they occupied Gao Saichou between Baisha Bridge and Ma Bridge. The connection between the Japanese troops in Xianning and Nanlin Bridge was cut off, causing great panic. They mobilized troops from Ma Bridge and Baidun in two routes to launch a counter-offensive against the Chinese troops, and are currently being fiercely attacked head-on by the Chinese troops. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang In the Xinyang area, there has been no change in the situation in recent months. To maintain their stronghold in Xinyang, Japanese troops are forcibly conscripting laborers in Fengjiadian, Youhe, Wujiadian, Luotuo Shop, etc., to build fortifications such as traffic trenches and barbed wire obstacles, attempting to hold their ground and prevent Chinese attacks. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese telegrams received here today, there are currently fierce battles between Xinhui and Zhongshan. It is reported that the Japanese troops are attempting to break through the Chinese water defenses near Da'ao and Shenwan in order to attack Shiqi. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Shanggao On the 15th, Chinese troops attacked Japanese troops in Wuchen Mountain, Lukeng, Zhang Daling, Huangtu and other places. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted, but after the Chinese troops bravely charged and killed, countless Japanese soldiers were killed. These places were successively recovered by the Chinese troops, and the remaining enemies fled towards Wuning and Ruichang. The Chinese troops are pursuing them. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde After the Japanese troops invaded Junshan, there have been no further movements. Large Chinese forces are currently closely monitoring the area near Junshan. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing The battle situation in Zhongshan has turned silent, and Shiqi is as peaceful as ever. The Japanese troops are mostly gathered in the Hai Shiyan, Zhuzhou, Mazhou, Xinsha, and Sansha areas (all under the jurisdiction of Xinhui), building fortifications and waiting for an opportunity to attack. From time to time, they use small units to harass the coast of Zhongshan. The Japanese troops in various places have been repulsed by the Chinese troops. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Seven or eight thousand Japanese troops who fled from the Yicheng and Jiangxian area to Zhangma Zhongcun (Southeast Yicheng) and other places have been counter-attacked by a certain Chinese unit in recent days, killing four or five hundred Japanese soldiers, and most of them have collapsed and fled towards Northeast Shanxi. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Chinese troops recaptured Guxian Town (Southwest Qin County) on the night of the 12th and continued to attack the area near the highway. In addition, a certain Chinese unit recaptured Yushe in one fell swoop on the 10th, and further occupied Wuxiang on the 11th. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>China Decides to Continue the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, the local Lianhe Daily reported that China's war of resistance will continue until the Japanese troops are driven to the other side of the Yalu River. The newspaper strongly condemned peace talks and urged the entire country to remain united and faithfully engage in the war of resistance under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Xin Jiang Puppet Troops Defect</h3>
<p>Dali More than three hundred Japanese troops and more than twenty puppet troops in Xin Jiang were attacked by Chinese troops on the 12th. The Japanese troops immediately went out of the city to stubbornly resist. During the fierce battle, all the puppet troops defected and charged towards the Japanese troops. The Chinese troops took advantage of the situation to charge into the Japanese positions, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled into the city, and all the puppet troops were incorporated into the Chinese army. (15th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's New Offensive and the War Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported news from Hong Kong that the Japanese side is planning to launch a new offensive. It is claimed that after July, Japan will use five divisions to attack Yichang, three divisions to encircle Changsha from Western Jiangxi, and six divisions to harass Northern Hunan along Dongting Lake. Such news is not the most reliable intelligence. Therefore, the adoption of the offensive, the timing of the launch, the number of troops used, and the target of the attack, the news that is transmitted is whether it coincides with the Japanese plan. These are all issues and cannot be regarded as completely true. However, based on the experience of the past two years, news from Hong Kong is sometimes extremely sensitive and has had many successes in the past. Moreover, the Japanese side has its own reasons for taking another offensive; it is said that riding on the back of a tiger makes it impossible to get off. This is ultimately the sad fate of those who are arrogant and impetuous, and the ultimate stumbling block of those who are trivial. The knowledgeable people had already estimated this, it is not unexpected. As for how to determine the ending, it is only a matter of time. Therefore, we do not ask what the news is based on or where it comes from, but would rather solemnly expect the confirmation of subsequent news.</p>
<p>War is action, and victory or defeat is a fact. The final fact is an indisputable ironclad case. As for the situation in the middle of the journey, it is not to be relied upon. Long-distance competition is the most accurate metaphor: Liu Changchun was magnificent, he grasped the quick battle and quick victory to win in the initial 100 meters, 200 meters, and even 400 meters and 800 meters; but when he left the stadium watched by thousands of eyes and turned inland, circling a large circle, there was absolutely no place for him; the final victory inevitably belonged to Wang Zheng, who was skinny and seemed to be undernourished. Now, it is clear that it is a long-distance race, but at the moment of 400 meters and 800 meters, ordering to stop, conspiring to stop, whether it is on the grounds of Wang Zheng's sweaty head, or with a compassionate attitude, but how can it cover up the fact that Liu Changchun is just a sprinter? Joy, anger, sorrow, and joy, all vividly exposed his lack of understanding; what is the benefit of praising Liu Changchun and cursing Wang Zheng? Knowing that there is no need to praise or curse, we remain silent and do not talk much about the war situation. Now that we occasionally receive the above-mentioned news from Hong Kong, please discuss our views on the war situation based on the news.</p>
<p>The Japanese side initially hoped for a quick battle and quick victory, and only prepared for a quick battle and quick victory. After the initial failure, the second step was to hope to achieve complete success before being exhausted, and perhaps still be able to annex and do whatever they wanted. After the second step was desperate, the third step was to hope for a wonderful method, to change the method, and permanently maintain the military occupied area obtained in the initial stage of the war. The current war situation is moving from the second step to the third step.</p>
<p>Moving from the second step to the third step, politics and economy are emphasized, and military affairs are de-emphasized. Assuming that it is easy to lift a weight, it is indeed wonderful, but the fact is not so. Let's take a shallow and near example: First, the two organizations in Nanjing and Beiping not only cannot share the burden of the Japanese army, but also cannot exist without the protection of the Japanese army; second, if the Japanese army lets go of the local organizations in various places without intervening, they are not at ease, but if they let go, they will only see the traitors taking advantage of the fire; third, the legal currency has plummeted in the black market, from one shilling two five to six seven pence; the enemy claps their hands and cheers when the legal currency plummets, who knows that one Japanese yen is only worth nine corners of the legal currency, in other words, the Japanese yen has closely followed the devaluation of the legal currency. This politically and economically shows that the second step to the third step still cannot be done without military hard work. This is probably the main reason for taking a new offensive. From a military perspective, "offense is the best defense" has its own technical reasons, so attacking Yichang is to protect Wuhan, attacking Changsha is to protect Nanchang, and attacking Northern Hunan is to protect Yuezhou; moreover, it is not only that. First, those who are arrogant and impetuous have not yet given up hope of "achieving complete success"; they do not know the arrival of the end until the end, so they take the offensive. Second, China openly declared that it would take a mobile combat; that is, under the meaning of the War of Resistance, it always uses the two methods of firm defense and counterattack; therefore, if the Japanese army does not attack Yichang, the Chinese army will attack Wuhan, that is, if the Japanese army cannot take Yichang, it cannot defend Wuhan, so it takes the offensive. Third, the war situation has been dull for three months, is the War of Resistance exhausted, or is the reorganization, training, and replenishment about to be completed; the matter needs to be probed, so it takes the offensive. There are these three reasons in military affairs, which have evolved into a possible offensive. In addition, the Tokyo negotiations between Britain and Japan use the momentum of a greater military voice on the white version as the strongest diplomatic backing; to the extreme, if China abandons the War of Resistance, Britain would have been driven out of the Far East long ago, how could there be the current Tokyo negotiations; if the Japanese army drives straight in, Britain would have lost its foothold long ago, how could there be the current Tokyo negotiations; if China has driven the Japanese army out of its territory, how could there be the current Tokyo negotiations; it can be seen that there is an inseparable relationship between the Chinese war situation and the Tokyo negotiations, then, at the beginning of the Tokyo negotiations, the Japanese side expressed that they would take another offensive, which also has its own international reasons. The truth and falsehood of the Soviet-Japanese war in Nomonhan, the cause and effect, and the propaganda, will not be explored in depth; but it has made the Japanese discouraged, and the Japanese army has been at a loss, which is inevitable. Therefore, while transferring troops to support several routes, they can only claim that they will take another offensive in China. The most can cover up the embarrassing situation of being stretched; this is another international reason.</p>
<p>This is a long-distance race! No matter how long the distance is, it is always getting closer; whether Japan takes a new offensive or China launches a general counter-offensive, it is always an important dynamic approaching the end. The facts created by the dynamics cannot be anesthetized by praise or curse; nor can they be changed by all the joys, sorrows, and joys; the final fact is the most certain destination; before the final destination, taking a new offensive as an important stage, we can wait and see.</p>

The division has neither Zhong Ziqi nor a deputy brigade commander who was captured.

<h3>Military Affairs Committee Announces Weekly War Report</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Military Affairs Committee issued a statement saying that in the past week, the war on all fronts has continued to progress, with particularly fierce fighting along the Taihang Mountains. A summary of the combat operations is as follows:</p>
<p>Jin-Yu Front: After the Japanese army suffered heavy defeats at the hands of the Chinese army in southern and western Shanxi last month, they regrouped on a large scale at the beginning of this month and launched an offensive against the Chinese army in the Taihang Mountains in five routes. One force proceeded from Pingyao and Longyao. After the Chinese army bravely resisted, in the Battle of Pingyao, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and over eight hundred corpses were abandoned in Liuwangzhen and Yangcun near Heshun, and they fled. Liaoxian was subsequently reported to have been recaptured. One force attempted to peer east into Chenshui and Yangcheng from Yicheng. After a week of bloody fighting, the Japanese advance was halted and they are currently deadlocked in the area west of Qinshui. One force attacked Huixian from Xinxiang to the north. After the Chinese army employed mobile tactics to encircle and severely attack the Japanese, who were in dire straits, they repeatedly requested aid from Xinxiang. One force advanced from Bo'ai to the southwest on two fronts, and after being encircled and annihilated at Xiaoweiying, five to six hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army urgently sent reinforcements from Xinxiang, but they were ambushed en route, resulting in significant casualties. Under the Chinese army's encirclement, ambush, and interception, the five routes of the Japanese army have all become spent arrows, with no strength to attack again.</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: The remaining Japanese forces in Dongguan, Dongjiang, were wiped out by the Chinese army's fierce attack, and the county seat has been recaptured. As for the Japanese army in Chao'an, on the evening of the 7th, they launched a fierce attack against the Bijia Mountain to the north. More than five hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated to Donglong and Nanting. Another unit of the Chinese army took the opportunity to recapture Chenghai County. The outer defenses of Chao'an are now completely surrounded and controlled. The Japanese army at Longkou, Beijiang, harassed Pingshan and Lianglong on the morning of the 11th, but were intercepted near Lianglong and suffered a hasty retreat. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced with over sixteen hundred infantry soldiers, and four airplanes provided air support, attacking the Chinese army on two fronts. The Chinese army employed mobile tactics, luring the Japanese into a pre-set ambush and launching a major encirclement. The Japanese fled in disarray, abandoning over four hundred corpses. The Japanese army in Xijiang, under the cover of artillery fire on the 11th, advanced on two fronts, one attacking Dieshi, and the other besieging Xinhui and Zhongshan. The Chinese garrison fiercely resisted, and the Japanese made no progress. Japanese warships gathered in the Mushi and Shimen waters were shelled by Chinese artillery, suffering considerable losses. The situation in Xinhui and Jiangmen is becoming increasingly stable, and the Japanese offensive has faltered.</p>
<p>Gan-Xiang-E Front: On the north and south banks of the Xiu River in northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Wuning from multiple routes starting on the morning of the 10th. The soldiers were loyal and brave, and have achieved many victories in recent days. On the north bank, after recapturing the Xidaqiao river stronghold, they continued to advance towards the county seat. On the south bank, a unit of the Chinese army broke through the Japanese defense line on the Xiu River and stormed into Yutianqiao and Jinkou, bombarding the city walls with artillery. The Japanese army within the city was under attack from all sides by the Chinese and was in great disarray, showing signs of fleeing. Another elite unit, after mopping up the Japanese army near Fengxin, fiercely pressed on the outskirts of the city, inflicting many casualties. Over a thousand Japanese soldiers in southern Hubei launched an offensive against Shentangpu and Tangpingpu for three days and nights. Due to the continuous arrival of Japanese reinforcements, the Chinese positions were temporarily breached by the Japanese army, but they immediately counterattacked and recaptured them completely. The remaining Japanese forces fled in disarray, and after pursuing them to the vicinity of Chongyang, over two hundred more were killed. The battle has now subsided. As for northern Hunan, the Japanese army that had invaded Junshan on the north bank of Dongting Lake on the morning of the 7th was pursued until the evening, and the Japanese, caught off guard, abandoned over a hundred corpses and fled by ship. The area was subsequently recaptured. In addition, within the territory of Suiyuan, our forces cut off the traffic between Guisui and Bailingmiao of the Japanese army invading from [missing characters], beheading over six hundred. In southern Henan, the remaining enemies at Luotuo Store were annihilated and Xinyang was besieged. In northern Jiangsu, Siyang was recaptured for a time, killing four to five hundred Japanese. In Anhui, they entered Huaiyuan and destroyed a large Japanese warship near Zhide. Repelling the landing Japanese troops on the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian were also important victories in the past week, and are reported here as an addendum. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Guoguang Discusses Chongqing's Administrative Policy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Mayor He, the Chongqing New City Government's administrative policy has two aspects: one is passive, focusing on protection work to reduce damage to citizens; the other is active, laying the foundation for construction for future reconstruction. Regarding the former, the city government is trying to increase air defense equipment, adding air-raid shelters, reservoirs, organizing alarm equipment, urging the accumulation of sand and water storage, and training fire brigades and rescue teams. Regarding the latter, the city government is building roads, improving transportation, and engaging in construction. Suburban markets have already been established, and the Construction Committee has borrowed a fund of three million yuan to actively proceed. After this plan is completed, a large Chongqing can be transformed into countless small Chongqings. At the same time, due to the improvement of transportation, countless small Chongqings can still be connected to form a large Chongqing. In this way, the threat of the Japanese can be eliminated, and the prosperity of the temporary capital can be promoted. (16th dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Neutrality Act Amendment Issue: President Determined to Adhere to Original Intention, Will Appeal to National Public Opinion If Isolationists Continue to Obstruct</h3>
<p>(Washington) Isolationist senators led by Senator Borah stated in Congress this morning that there is no prospect of the Neutrality Act being passed in this session of Congress, so Congress should adjourn on August 5. However, government senators said that this is a conspiracy to sabotage and prevent the Neutrality Act from being fairly discussed. The government side stated that if the isolationists force Congress to adjourn, President Roosevelt will make a broadcast speech to appeal to the people on the Neutrality Act issue, and will also speak on this issue while traveling along the West Coast. The President deeply feels that the international situation requires Congress to decide on the Neutrality Act immediately, and he will not compromise on the isolationists' demands. The isolationist senators are eager to return home, but seem to forget that the President can reconvene a special session of Congress. If the isolationists do not allow the Senate to discuss the Neutrality Act at this critical juncture, the President will definitely exercise his right to reconvene Congress. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Message Receives High Praise from Newspapers, Pittman's Arms Embargo Bill Awaits Hull's Response</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, although President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday received high praise from American newspapers, people in Congress said that Congress will adjourn on August 5, and there is no hope that the Neutrality Act issue will be brought up for discussion in the current session of Congress. A liberal newspaper, the Washington Daily News, recently commented on the President's message: "It is doubtful whether Congress will be able to achieve anything in the current session. … The President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull's proposed neutrality plan should be accepted immediately by Congress. If it is shelved and Congress is eager to adjourn, then the German Nazi Party workers in the United States will be able to report to Führer Hitler that no matter what happens in the future, the United States will only act within the scope of the current Neutrality Act. However, recent public opinion polls have shown that the majority still support providing war materials to Britain and France in wartime. Once Germany initiates hostilities, the people's sentiment in support of Britain and France will quickly solidify in Congress. It is hoped that the Nazi Party workers will pay attention to this and offer a sincere warning to Führer Hitler." (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently proposed a bill to authorize the President to prohibit the shipment of weapons, ammunition, kerosene, etc. to countries that violate the Nine-Power Treaty. According to the current situation, not only Republicans are opposed, but also the government is hesitant. The Committee is concerned that after the passage of this bill, it may conflict legally with the current US-Japan Treaty of Commerce (established in 1911, stipulating that neither signatory country may impose discriminatory treatment on the other), and has decided to first seek the opinion of Secretary of State Hull. The Secretary of State will submit a written response early next week. According to diplomatic sources, the response will state that such an embargo is inconsistent with the obligations accepted by the United States government in the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. Observers say that the US government has no intention of denouncing the treaty, because the United States' cotton production still relies on Japan as its largest customer. In the past eleven months, Japan has purchased 846,000 bales of American cotton, worth 42,569,000 US dollars, more than twice the amount purchased by Britain. There is a large surplus of cotton in the United States, and if an embargo is imposed on Japan, Japan will definitely stop buying American cotton in retaliation, which is not something the United States wants to see. Therefore, it is almost certain that the Pittman bill will not pass. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Man Sails Small Boat Across Pacific Ocean</h3>

<h3>US Considers New Loan to China, President of US Export-Import Bank Says Previous Loan Used Successfully</h3>
<p>(Washington) Government officials here are very satisfied with the progress of the $25 million credit loan granted by the US Export-Import Bank to China last year, a semi-official nature. Therefore, it is generally expected that the United States will likely continue to grant new loans to China. Mr. Pierson, President of the US Export-Import Bank, told a reporter from the Associated Press yesterday that he was satisfied with the progress of the previous credit loan to China. Due to the situation in the Far East, he did not want to announce how much of the $25 million credit loan had been delivered to China, but a large quantity of goods has been shipped to China. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of granting new loans and new credit loans to China depends entirely on the upcoming discussion in the US Congress of the "Increase Export-Import Bank Loan Economy" bill. An increase in loan funds seems to be no problem. Pierson continued that the smooth progress of the first loan to China is an important factor in continuing to grant loans to the Chinese government in the future. Well-informed sources claim that to date, several million US dollars of US credit loans to China have been used, mostly for the purchase of cargo vehicles. (16th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Peasants Riot in Mexican Mountains, Government Troops Suppressing</h3>
<p>Mexico City: Rumors have spread that a revolutionary movement has broken out in Mexico. Officials here have denied this, but said that disturbances occurred in a certain area in the interior around the wheat harvest season, which is true. All states have armed peasant forces, and their leaders each advocate political beliefs, or act for their own benefit, or serve a certain political party. Recently, a large armed peasant force, led by the bandit Cabecilla, has been looting in the Cuechalen Mountains. The terrain is rugged and difficult to suppress, so government troops have imposed martial law and dispatched a large army, commanded by General Cama Cho, Governor of the State of Puebla, to be responsible for the suppression. Local order has now returned to normal. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Governors of India and Burma Discuss Defense</h3>
<p>Simla, India: The Governor of Burma, Sir Cochrane, who is returning to England on leave, stated yesterday that he had a long conversation with the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, discussing various issues related to India and the British headquarters, among which defense issues are particularly important.

<h3>British Undersecretary and French Ambassador Discuss Diplomatic Issues, Moscow Talks Will Continue, Britain and Poland Promote Military Cooperation, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin Returns Home for Consultation</h3>
<p>(London) French Ambassador to Britain Corbin returned home for consultation and departed last night. Before leaving, he had a long conversation with Sir Cadogan, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Sachett, Assistant Secretary. According to diplomatic sources, the topics discussed were extensive, including the Far East issue, the progress of the British-French-Soviet talks, the Polish issue, and the Spanish issue. Regarding the Far East issue, it involves the Tokyo talks between Britain and Japan. The British side has always maintained that the subject of the negotiations should be limited to resolving the Tianjin incident. Regarding the British-French-Soviet talks, the British government has sent new instructions to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, several points of which the Ambassador requested clarification. The British and French authorities exchanged views yesterday so that the Moscow talks can continue next week. Regarding the Polish issue, General Ironside, Inspector-General of Overseas Forces of Britain, will travel to Warsaw on the 17th by plane with the Deputy Military Attaché of the Polish Embassy in Britain, for a four-day stay, and will hold talks with the Polish Army General Staff and General Smigly-Ridz, Inspector-General of the Army. It is rumored that General Ironside will take the opportunity to visit Moscow, but this statement has been denied by well-informed sources. However, if the British-French-Soviet talks are successful, General Ironside will immediately consult with the French and Soviet military authorities on the technical issues of implementing the trilateral mutual assistance agreement. It is hoped that this military conference can be held in London or Paris. Regarding the Spanish issue, since General Franco recently published a statement in the Portuguese newspaper "Noticias", stating that if war breaks out in Europe, Spain will remain neutral, this can be regarded as another favorable factor in the European situation. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) General Ironside will fly to Poland tomorrow to begin British-Polish military talks. The purpose of the talks is to strengthen the power of joint action between the two countries in wartime and to promote the British-Polish mutual assistance agreement. In addition to seeking a permanent mutual assistance agreement, Britain also plans to provide economic assistance to Poland. (16th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Discusses Situation in Danzig, Says Fate Depends on Britain and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The "Frankfurter Zeitung" published an article today discussing the general international situation and the Danzig issue, stating: "Britain's plan to bring the Soviet Union into the encirclement has not made much progress. Regarding the Danzig issue, Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration has repeatedly stated that Britain will provide military assistance. If war breaks out as expected, Britain will protect Poland just like the Wailing Wall. Regarding this issue, the London "Daily Express" said: "The Western democracies have no foothold in Eastern Europe. If war breaks out, Poland must mobilize an army equal to the German army in Eastern Europe. After Poland achieves final victory, it can decide its fate. The Western countries want to launch this war to destroy totalitarian countries and thus end all problems." What is the basis for this statement? We believe that if Britain treats Poland with sincerity, it should urge Poland to make peace with Germany and find a solution to the Danzig issue, because Britain is in fact unable to guarantee Poland's independence and welfare, no matter how long it takes. In fact, the fate of Danzig depends on Germany and the Soviet Union. Danzig's geographical location and political interests are all within the scope of Germany and the Soviet Union."

<h3>First Batch of British Militia Trained, 34,000 Young Men Enlist, Secretary of War Speaks to New Recruits</h3>
<p>(London) 34,000 of the 200,000 British militiamen reported to military camps today. Those in camps near Folkestone were inspected by Queen Mary, while other camps were inspected by Secretary of War Bailey Xia and military officers. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the first batch of 34,000 new soldiers, all young men aged 20 to 21, departed from railway stations in major cities in an extremely pleasant atmosphere and went to various places for training. The authorities treated these young men with great hospitality. After they arrived at the camp, they first enjoyed a rich lunch, and then were guided to visit all parts of the camp for a week before distributing weapons and various equipment. According to the regulations of the training program, the new soldiers will be trained for six months. In the first two weeks, they will first receive preparatory training, and then receive formal military training, such as long-distance walking and various exercises. However, physical education will always occupy an important position. Those who personally inspected the barracks in various places today included Queen Mary and Minister of War Bailey Xia. The Secretary of War also made a brief speech to the trainees, stating that "You will experience an extremely democratic life here in these six months, a rare encounter in your life."

<h3>The Baltic States Threatened by Germany: The German Minority Question and German Demands</h3>
<p>At a time when negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are underway in the Latvian capital, Riga, the relationship between the Baltic states and Germany has drawn considerable attention from the press. The Nazi Party newspaper "Danziger Vorposten" of the Free City of Danzig recently reported that when Germany previously negotiated non-aggression treaties with Estonia and Latvia, it requested compensation for the German minority issue in those countries. This revelation has caused considerable shock among those concerned. Estonia has approximately 20,000 ethnic Germans whose legal status was resolved by the 1925 Minority Law, which even the Germans feel satisfied with. Latvia, on the other hand, has 70,000 ethnic Germans, most of whom are landowners, with the remainder being merchants, teachers, and Christian pastors, primarily residing in cities. They form a leadership class and constitute the bourgeoisie. The native Latvians are mostly farmers, economically dominated by the German landowners and culturally influenced by German teachers and pastors. Consequently, the German minority in Latvia has been able to establish its own unique identity in both economic and cultural terms, effectively creating a "state within a state." This is inconsistent with the trends in modern nation-states. It was not until 1935 that the Latvian government began to implement various measures to reform this situation, which immediately caused an uproar among the Germans, who claimed that their vital living space was being seized by Latvia and that Germany must resist with the utmost determination. Now that the "Danziger Vorposten" has stated that Germany has demands regarding the German minority issue, it is clear that Germany intends to revisit the old issue and exert pressure on the Baltic states. Given this, it is not difficult to understand why the Soviet Union raised the issue of "indirect aggression" during the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, demanding a definition. Germany's claim that "Germandom is under threat and must be defended with action" raises the question of what degree of action would be deemed sufficient to stop. Latvia, having learned from the past events in Czechoslovakia and the Memel region, is undoubtedly aware of the threat and feels understandably uneasy. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>How Generous are New York Beggars! Can Earn US$120 Per Month. New York Mayor Begins Anti-Begging Campaign</h3>
<p>(New York) Mayor LaGuardia of New York has announced the start of a campaign to "eradicate" street begging. City officials estimate that New York beggars earn no less than $15 million annually. Notices have been posted on buses, trams, and subways stating that genuine paupers in New York can now receive public assistance and that the only way to eradicate begging is not to give alms to beggars. According to Mr. Hodson, the head of the New York City Welfare Bureau, it is estimated that at least 10,000 people in New York are living off begging. He also stated that a blind musician asked the city authorities to guarantee him public assistance of $125 per month, but he would still beg because he could earn at least that amount playing the violin in the street. New York beggars have guilds and clubs that use all sorts of begging techniques. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>National Socialism, Art: German Art Festival, Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>(Munich, Germany) Today is the German Art Festival in Munich. Leader Hitler delivered a speech here, elucidating the National Socialist view of art. He stated, "The government not only has the right to intervene in art, but it is also its duty. Every great revolution of an era must leave a distinct mark on art. Thus, art must embrace modern trends. Before 1870, our country was politically strong, but it did not fully express its national character in art. Today, art should no longer be controlled by sickly aesthetes but should be based on national life, creating a type of art that even the government should not hesitate to intervene in."

<h3>Preliminary Anglo-Japanese Negotiations: Vastly Different Opinions: Arita Demands Recognition of New Situation in the Far East; Craigie Insists on Maintaining Existing Rights and Interests</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to political figures here, the three-hour meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie yesterday morning resulted only in a formal explanation of both sides' positions. Arita explained the reasons for Japan's actions in Tianjin, believing that Japan's measures were not only reasonable but also necessary. He stated that Anglo-Japanese relations are strained everywhere and that a satisfactory solution is impossible unless Britain is prepared to cooperate with Japan. Arita then emphasized the intensity of Japanese public opinion, stating that the British Ambassador should note that public opinion is undoubtedly leaning towards a definite solution to fundamental issues. Craigie presented the following points as the basis for negotiation: (1) The neutrality of the concessions must be respected; (2) British rights and interests in China must be maintained as they are. Craigie also stated that he was not instructed to discuss general issues; in other words, he will limit the scope of discussion to the Tianjin incident. According to political speculation, the first round of talks has indicated how the negotiations will proceed, so the distance between the two sides' opinions is undeniable. Therefore, the difficulty and length of the negotiations are expected. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>

Sir Craigie replied that the fundamental principles should be discussed after the real causes of the Tianjin dispute have been discussed. Thereupon Arita stated that understanding on fundamental principles was necessary for negotiations to proceed. It is also rumored that Arita stated that negotiations should be conducted based on Japan's views. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italian Government Intends to Abolish Anglo-Italian Agreement: Gayda Reviews Anglo-Italian Relations</h3>
<p>(London) There are rumors that the Italian government will abolish the Anglo-Italian Agreement (established on April 16, 1938). Political figures here commented that the agreement has long been a mere formality, but Britain does not want to initiate its abolition and allow Italy to regain freedom of action. Italy, also, does not consider it advantageous to be the first to abolish it. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Famous journalist Gayda (considered Mussolini's spokesperson) recently wrote an article in the "Giornale d'Italia" reviewing the current relations between Britain and Italy due to foreign newspapers' comments on the transfer of Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi to the position of Minister of Justice, some taking it as a sign of Italy changing its policy towards Britain. He stated, "It is inaccurate to say that Italy has changed its attitude towards Britain, because it is Britain, not Italy, that has changed its attitude. Since 1935, Britain's policy towards Italy has changed, adopting an aggressive and hostile attitude instead of the past harmony and understanding. When the time is right, Italy will naturally respond accordingly. Today, Italy is determined to defend its national interests and advance hand in hand with its loyal allies, regardless of any events that may occur." Political figures here commented that the Italian government may intend to declare the abolition of the Anglo-Italian Agreement established on April 16, 1938. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>American Airplane Broker Seeks Compensation from Mitsubishi Corporation: A Total of US$265,000</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) American export merchant Clement sued Mitsubishi Corporation in court here yesterday, demanding Mitsubishi pay $265,000 in aircraft purchase commissions. In April 1936, Lockeheed sold 40 aircraft to Japan through Clement, with a total price of $2.85 million. Clement should have received a commission of $385,000. Clement originally planned to sue Lockheed as well, but because the company had already paid $20,000, Clement withdrew the lawsuit against the company. (Associated Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Bank Involved in Lawsuit in the United States: Sues Federal Bank, Court Rejects</h3>
<p>(New York) The former Republican government of Spain sold silver worth $6.45 million to the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States. After the Nationalists won in Spain, the Spanish Bank wanted to claim this amount from the Federal Reserve Bank, and thus became involved in a lawsuit. The Federal Reserve Bank's lawyer argued in the New York State Federal Court that the Republican government was the legitimate government of Spain at the time, and that the purchase of silver and payment of the silver price by the Federal Reserve Bank was entirely legal. The court recently ruled to reject the Spanish Bank's complaint. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Turbulent Situation in Europe and Asia: The Question of World Peace and War: The Danzig Crisis Remains a Ticking Time Bomb; Göring Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the German-Italian Air Force; Unofficial Discussion in London on June 30th</h3>
<p>London Airmail: The closer we watch the evolution of various objective situations, the more we cannot help but feel that today's world is indeed heading towards an inseparable, completely organic state day by day. For example, this question here:</p>
<p>"Peace or War?"</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, international wars have been going on in this world for several years, and the so-called "peace" has long disappeared. All countries in the world can be divided into only two major categories: those at war and those preparing for war. There is no such thing as "outsider," and certainly no "neutrality." However, if the term "war" only refers to actually participating in combat, as in the last World War, then this next world war has not yet officially begun. At this time, if there is a genuine determination to save world peace, then it still seems quite possible. However, there are undoubtedly only two paths to take: one is for countries determined to maintain peace to form an overwhelming dominant group, and with the determination to fight a war, cancel and remedy all the achievements of aggression in recent years, and forcibly stop those who are still aggressing. Then, future aggression will naturally disappear. Only then can the foundation of so-called peace be laid. Otherwise, take another path, which is for countries determined to maintain peace to cooperate thoroughly, emphasize the collective security system, and first defeat the aggressing countries. The remaining aggressor countries will naturally shrink back, and then it will be possible to further lay the foundation for the future peace of the world.</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt's inquiry to Germany and Italy not long ago was, to some extent, following the first path. As for an example of the second path, we can cite the Soviet government's policy of aiding aggressed countries in recent years. Other than that, attempts to divide regions, deal with them individually, and break up the aggressor country groups have only resulted in falling into their trap of exploiting each other. As for the idea that they can be given enough satisfaction to stop them, it actually increases their desires. In the end, not only will it not save world peace, but it will promote the outbreak of a large-scale war.</p>
<p>However, when we review the recent progress of the international situation, we must admit that the evolution of objective facts has exceeded the control of subjective forces. So although there are the subjective efforts of the United States and Russia, the overall situation is developing closer and closer to the arrival of that great war day by day.</p>
<p>There is usually a specific term for this stage of the eve of the Great War, which is: "Crisis." Today's Europe is again filled with predictions of the arrival of another "crisis."</p>
<p>First of all, the repeated delays in cooperation negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have made Germany's actions appear particularly active recently. Hitler is putting all his efforts into planning how to prevent the formation of this alliance. We now know for sure that he has obtained firm commitments from the Baltic states in recent days: if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union automatically guarantee their independence and integrity, then they must first refuse, and even resist. If the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance had been formed two weeks ago, then it might not have been so rigid. The current situation is indeed a bit troublesome. However, based on the current situation alone, if the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance is formed immediately, then it can still be recovered with a little effort. What is worrying is Hitler's second conspiracy, which is that after the failure of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, he plans to propose to the Soviet Union to jointly guarantee their security. Whether the Soviet Union will accept at that time is certainly a question, but based on the proposal itself, it does have an unparalleled allure for these weak countries.</p>
<p>If the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations continue to drag on without any results, then by around August 1st of this year, Germany will have 1.5 million troops mobilized. At that time, Hitler will immediately raise the demand to reclaim Danzig. Germany's plan is probably to first brew a separatist movement within Danzig, and then go with the flow, like Austria last year. As for the mobilization of 1.5 million troops, it is mainly to demonstrate to Poland and Britain and France. Up to now, although Britain has repeatedly warned Germany that if it uses force to threaten and make demands, Britain will never sit idly by. If Poland feels it necessary to resist, then Britain is prepared to fulfill the Anglo-Polish agreement and take joint action. At the same time, Poland has also repeatedly declared that it will never allow Danzig to be incorporated into Germany, and would rather fight if necessary. However, Germany absolutely does not believe these statements. It is determined that if all its estimates are correct, then when the time comes, the only path that Britain and Poland can take is probably to succumb. Therefore, Hitler intends to obtain Danzig before the annual Nazi Party Congress in September, as a diplomatic victory, and present it in his report.</p>
<p>We know that the crisis of seizing Danzig on April 29th was temporarily dismissed due to Mussolini's hesitation. Now, this plan, this conspiracy against Danzig, is of course also being discussed with Mussolini. What will Mussolini's next attitude be? From all sides, it does not seem to be certain yet. Not long ago, Mussolini specially instructed Ambassador Grandi to Britain to investigate Britain's possible reaction. Later, this Ambassador Grandi, known for his anti-British sentiments, immediately reported that, based on Britain's current attitude, it is bound to resist any aggression in Europe. When this report reached Rome, it was first seen by Foreign Minister Ciano. This Ciano, who is the strongest advocate of pro-German sentiment and a worshiper of Hitler, immediately dismissed the opinions in it and suppressed it, not letting Mussolini see it. It was not until recently, when Grandi returned to Rome, that he told Mussolini the details. This caused great dissatisfaction from Mussolini towards Ciano. Presumably, regarding the attitude towards this matter, there are still some differences between Mussolini and Ciano to this day.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the German troops have concentrated on the border with Poland, and the people of Europe are once again uneasy. However, judging from the situation, it does not seem that there will be a sudden attack in the short term.</p>
<p>Italy's conspiracy to invade British and French territories in Africa has recently had further concrete developments. Last week, Italian army and air force authorities held an important meeting with German authorities in Berlin to decide all future offensive plans.</p>
<p>We only know that the Italian air force representative was Aviation Minister General Valle, while the German representative was General Milch. Afterwards, it was rumored that in the event of a great war in the future, the commander-in-chief of the German-Italian joint air force had been decided to be General Göring, the dictator of Germany's "Four-Year Economic Plan." Moreover, it is said that a formal appointment has been issued.</p>
<p>The decided operational plan is probably to first attack Egypt in two routes, one starting from Italian Libya and the other starting from Abyssinia, with the final destination being the Suez Canal. At the same time as the attack on Egypt, there are two other armies departing from Gondar in Abyssinia, one attacking Kassala in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the other attacking Khartoum. This plan was proposed by the German side.</p>
<p>However, some well-known military personnel in Italy opposed the above plan, such as General Balbo and General Badoglio. As for the biggest reason Germany put forward this plan, it is because the fortifications built by France in Tunisia are currently difficult to destroy, while Britain's preparations in Egypt are far from complete, so it is easier to win by attacking Egypt first.</p>
<p>At the same time as the above-mentioned invasion plan in Africa, various plans to contain Europe are also being accelerated. In northwestern Italy, along the foot of the Alps, towards France, a large number of technicians have been sent by Germany to help strengthen the fortifications. According to German estimates, in the event of a major war, the French army intends to break into Italy from here, so once this line of defense is connected to the German and Austrian lines of defense, then in a major war, at least in the short term, the British and French Allied forces will be unable to enter Eastern Europe by land to give assistance to Poland, Romania, Turkey, etc.</p>
<p>This line of defense reinforcement, in any case, will be completed by the end of July by Germany and Italy. By then, in the event that Germany raises the demand for Danzig, then it hopes to use this to warn Poland, implying the hopelessness of British and French aid, and that it is better to succumb to Germany.</p>
<p>What is even more indicative of the mutual support of aggressor groups is the close connection between Germany, Japan, and Italy recently. In the communication two weeks ago, the reporter pointed out that if Japan fails to deal with the Tianjin concession issue with Britain, then it will immediately join the German-Italian military alliance. Now we know that the actual situation is more than that. Recently, German Admiral Förste went to Japan on Hitler's orders to observe the possibility of Japanese soldiers promoting joining the German-Italian military alliance, and has already submitted a report to Hitler. His report can probably be divided into the following points: (1) Not only will it join the German-Italian alliance after failing to deal with the British concession issue, but it will definitely join even after victory. The reason is that in that way, it can restrain future British and French intervention once and for all. (2) According to the Japanese military authorities, there will probably be a final conclusion before mid-August. (3) Not only the British concession in Tianjin, but the Japanese military intends to abolish all existing foreign concessions throughout China, all of which are in the planning list. In the future, economic agreements will be signed by the Japanese military with Germany and Italy, with German and Italian economic trade replacing the past British, American, and French economies.</p>
<p>At the time when the reporter was writing this communication, it was when the British government intended to negotiate with Japan in Tokyo to resolve the Tianjin incident. Now, the entire British public opinion is in a state of resentment and suspicion towards the government. However, judging from the current situation, it seems that there is absolutely no room for compromise on the so-called "larger scope" issues.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall international situation, not only is the need for an Anglo-French-Soviet alliance very urgent, the need for the United States, Britain, and France to be in step is very urgent, but at this time, the need for further tacit understanding and cooperation between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the more powerful allies standing between them, such as Poland, Turkey, and China, is also urgent.</p>
<p>All of this indicates that world peace is indivisible, and so is security.</p>
<h3>Manchuria is a Heavy Burden for Japan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>Numbers Are Hard to Trust</p>
<p>The warlords and their propagandists say: Japan's exports to Manchuria have increased. This is true; there are numbers to prove it. However, when these trade figures are used to indicate that Japan has profited from this, it reminds one of an old American saying: "Figures don't lie, but liars figure." Because the ordinary Chinese people of Manchuria are extremely poor and lack purchasing power, the Japanese exports of cotton goods and other materials for consumption by the Manchurian masses have indeed declined. The significant increase in Japan's exports to Manchuria is limited to certain special items, including railway and construction materials to meet the military and industrial needs of the warlords in the occupied areas. It also includes automobiles, wheat, flour, beer, fruits, etc., for the consumption of Japanese warlords or their subordinate staff. Although "luxury goods" have decreased sharply, the overall economic situation regarding trade relations between Manchuria and Japan remains unchanged. Whether the goods exported from Japan to Manchuria are for military and industrial use or for the personal enjoyment of the Japanese ruling class and Chinese puppets, the value is paid from the hundreds of millions of yen that Japan pours into Manchuria each year for military and "investment" purposes. The nature of the exported products makes this clear and beyond any doubt. They are mostly consumed by Japanese people in Manchuria in place of Japanese people in Japan, but the cost is borne by Japanese taxpayers who subsidize the warlords.</p>
<p>Even before the war south of the Great Wall in 1937, the terrible burden of Manchuria on the Japanese people was severely felt. Since Japan began its occupation of Manchuria in 1931, the burden of Manchuria has reached over 2 billion yen. The Japanese economy has shown serious strain due to this burden, but the warlords are engaged in the current war under this strained economy. Since the beginning of the war, the warlords' expenses in Manchuria have greatly increased due to the need to cope with the rebellions of the Chinese people in Manchuria, the entry of the Chinese Eighth Route Army, and the terrifying possibility of being struck by the Soviet Union. If Japan collapses this summer due to exhaustion, the reason will likely be that the warlords' occupation of Manchuria has placed an unsustainable burden on the shoulders of the Japanese people. This can be clearly understood by looking back at the past. (The End)</p>
<h3>Dinghai After the Occupation: A Scene of Desolation</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Dinghai is located east of Zhejiang and is a major production area for fisheries and salt in our country. Since it was occupied by the Japanese army on the 23rd of last month, all parties have been extremely concerned about the recent situation in Dinghai. The recent situation is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Miserable Market Conditions</p>
<p>In Dingcheng, all the major stores closed their doors and suspended business during the Japanese attack and evacuated to the suburbs. After the county town was occupied, the Japanese army forced the owners of the stores to return to the city and resume business as usual. Currently, among the stores in the city, the earliest to reopen was the Tongshoutai Sauce and Pickles Shop. The Jinchang Store at the front of the street has not yet resumed business because the partners and employees have taken refuge in Shanghai and Ningbo and have not yet returned. Currently, very few residents have returned to the city, so business in the stores is sluggish, and the market situation is extremely desolate, like a dead market.</p>
<p>Process of the Occupation</p>
<p>After Dinghai was occupied by the Japanese, a maintenance association was organized. The "chairman" is Ding Ziheng, the "vice-chairman" is a Mr. Chen, the "police chief" is Shen Kunquan, the "finance section chief" is Chen Songling, and the "transportation section chief" is Hu Hesheng. Chen Zizhen's son, Botang, and He Acang, etc., filled out certificates of good citizenship. Thugs Guo Ading, Xiao Jin, etc., have now been ordered to go to Daxie to try to cut off the sea route between Dinghai and Chuanshan. The address of the "Maintenance Association" is located at the former county government site. The fact that Dinghai fell in a few hours after the Japanese army's invasion was truly unexpected. According to sources, those who guided the Japanese army to invade were the son of Mr. Lu, the owner of the Xinyizhai Pharmacy in Nancheng, and a waiter from a certain hotel at the front of the street. They are all local hooligans. The private Zhoushan Junior High School in this county was founded by Liu Hongsheng. Its principal, Fang Tongyuan, is a Bachelor of Arts from Shanghai Hujiang University. He went to Japan in the autumn of the 23rd year to study education. In order to protect the school property, he was detained by the Japanese and forced to serve as a key member of the Maintenance Association. Later, Mr. Fang seized the opportunity to escape to Jintang and cross the sea to Ningbo. When he arrived in Ningbo, the military and political authorities detained him because he had served as a puppet. After Mr. Fang clarified the situation, he was released and took a car to Jinhua.</p>
<p>Terrible Burning and Killing</p>
<p>The Hongjia Ancestral Hall near Touqiao outside the North Gate of this city was previously the headquarters of the Dinghai County Engineering Communications Personnel Training Class and the location of the military telephone switchboard. Therefore, when the Japanese army searched the northern suburbs, they immediately set the ancestral hall on fire, burning it to ashes. Recently, it was heard that when the Japanese army searched Xiqiling outside the East Gate, they saw a bride who had taken refuge in the countryside and was very beautiful. The Japanese army wanted to rape her. When the bride saw this, she was terrified and fled. The Japanese army fired a shot and seriously injured her in the waist. Then they fired two more shots, and she was killed. Also, Jin Ayou, the owner of the Donggangpu Ice Factory, was shot and killed when he went to weigh ice with a scale.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships on Alert</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Dinghai, fearing that the Chinese army would counterattack by sea, they have mobilized Japanese warships from various places and stationed them in the Zhoushan Islands for defense. It is said that there are currently seven or eight ships stationed in the islands near Dinghai. Two ships are anchored near, one ship is anchored in the Yutang waters, one ship is anchored in the Mazhi waters, one ship is anchored in the Zhujiajian waters, two ships are anchored in Gaoting, Daishan, Dongshajiao, and other places, and one ship is anchored near Luomen. It is also said that there are six or seven seaplanes parked in front of the Minsheng Refined Salt Factory in Donggangpu. From this, it can be seen how afraid they are of guerrilla teams crossing the sea to counterattack.</p>

<h3>New Price Limit for National Rice: To Be Implemented Starting This Morning; Previous Transactions to Follow Original Prices; Any Transactions Exceeding the Price Limit Hereafter Will Not Be Considered Valid</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association announced in the market yesterday morning: It has been found that the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau and the French Concession Public Bureau, in order to regulate the people's food supply, have convened representatives of this association to discuss the results and decided to continue to suppress rice prices. From today (transactions before July 15, 28th year will be calculated according to the original transaction price), whether wholesale or retail, the price of high-quality japonica rice must not exceed 20 yuan of national currency per stone, and the highest price of premium indica rice must not exceed 16 yuan of national currency per stone. The middle grades must be reduced accordingly. Any transaction exceeding the price limit by both the buyer and seller will not be considered valid, and real reports can be made to the police at any time for investigation and punishment. This announcement is urgently made to all colleagues in the industry to comply with the regulations in order to maintain the people's food supply. This is the announcement.</p>
<p>Invite Companies to Advise Compliance</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee convened a meeting of representatives from 105 companies at the Qinglian Pavilion venue at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qian'geng, Director of Market Management Committee. He first reported on the results of discussions with Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Nianxuan, and He De Kui, Deputy Director of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau. It was also decided that the new price limit for national rice would be implemented starting from the 17th, and all colleagues were expected to comply in order to avoid sanctions from the Concession authorities. However, transactions before July 15, 28th year will be calculated according to the original transaction price. If any transaction exceeds the price limit by both buyer and seller hereafter, it will not be considered valid.</p>
<p>Market Opening, Association Regular Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday was the market's regular holiday on Sunday. The market will open at 9:00 this morning. It is heard that the Public Concession Engineering Bureau has assigned supervisors to station in the market to monitor the transactions of each company. Therefore, transactions after the market opens this morning will definitely be concluded below the new price limit. In addition, the Rice Trade Association will hold a joint executive and supervisory committee regular meeting at 3:00 this afternoon. In addition to discussing internal meetings, a report will be submitted on the new price limit agreed with the Concession authorities. Also, a reporter from Xin Sheng She interviewed a leader of the rice industry yesterday. According to him, there are more than 300,000 bags of rice stored in Shanghai, and this does not include the rice pre-purchased by residents. At the same time, rice stored inland is being transported to Shanghai one after another, and the time for new rice to enter the market is near. The overall food supply in Shanghai will definitely not be lacking.</p>
<h3>After the New Typhoon Landed, It Dissipated and Disappeared; The Local Climate Was Also Affected; The Atmospheric Pressure Increased, and Clear Weather Is Expected</h3>
<p>The newly formed hurricane near Luzon Island landed in southern Fujian and Hainan the day before yesterday morning. At 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, it reached the vicinity of Qingyuan County in Zhejiang Province, 120 nautical miles west of Wenzhou. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's investigation yesterday morning, the hurricane has now shown signs of dispersion and disappearance. The weather in Shanghai yesterday morning was cloudy with occasional squalls and showers, which was affected by the dispersed and scattered hurricane. Therefore, Shanghai has been spared from being attacked. In addition, the atmospheric pressure in Shanghai is now trending upward, and the weather will improve.</p>
<h3>Financiers Talk About the New Subsidiary Currency Vouchers: The Printing Cost Should Increase the Paper Value; The Stabilization Fund Does Not Guarantee It</h3>
<p>Since the copper-nickel subsidiary coins circulating in the market have been affected by a certain party's purchase and hoarding, members of the exchange and banknote exchange industries have tried their best to meet the needs of the market, but there is still an unavoidable shortage and panic. The Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, has printed one-cent and five-cent subsidiary currency vouchers at the China Bookstore in Hong Kong. They will soon be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities for circulation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Daguang News Agency specifically consulted a giant in the financial community about the circulation of these vouchers. He was asked whether they would still be affected by hoarding and shortages in the future. Please give your opinion. According to him, the subsidiary currencies of our country used to be copper notes and copper coins. Later, because the prices of all goods rose sharply and the value of copper notes exceeded the value of copper in the notes, copper notes were abolished and only copper coins were used. Soon, copper coins were also affected by the above-mentioned factors. After the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, the financial authorities cast new one-cent copper subsidiary coins and five-cent and one-dime nickel subsidiary coins. Until the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the prices of all goods soared again and again, so that the value of the copper subsidiary coins was less than twice the value of the copper in the coins. This coin is both an important raw material for military use and can achieve the economic goal of disrupting the daily needs of civilians.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was purchased and hoarded. Today, the competent authorities, Liu, are particularly able to understand the advantages and disadvantages of this problem. Therefore, they specifically issued new subsidiary currency vouchers for circulation. According to my opinion, when the Central Bank issues these new vouchers, the Ministry of Finance should increase the paper value of these one-cent and five-cent new vouchers as much as possible, preferably exceeding the currency value by three or four times. It is like the voucher clearly stating a currency value of one cent, but the cost price of the paper material is worth three or four cents. Each type of voucher clearly issues a currency value of one million yuan, but the cost would be three or four million yuan. In this way, for this loss-making business, it will naturally stop on its own. Moreover, these new vouchers are only limited to the occupied areas of Shanghai, and the Stabilization Committee will no longer guarantee them. They do not create problems for the international market and are the most wonderful preventive fortress. This is just a suggestion for reference.</p>
<h3>Unified Government Bonds: Payment to Begin at the End of the Month; Bondholders Should Fill Out Discount Certificates Application Form; Payment Method for Renaissance Bonds Has Also Been Determined</h3>
<p>In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong and agreed that the seventh installment of principal and interest on unified government bonds guaranteed by customs duties should be paid by discount. The Chongqing head offices of the three banks of Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao will pay in full, while Shanghai and other ports will pay in six installments. Although the official order has not arrived in Shanghai, the banking community has confirmed that this is a fact. Therefore, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has printed discount certificates and installment payment forms. It is stipulated that when bondholders apply for this installment of principal and interest, they should fill out the application form for discount certificates for the redemption of principal and interest on government bonds in detail, along with the matured principal and interest coupons, and submit them to the staff of the three banks of Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao for verification. They will immediately divide the actual amount paid for the winning bonds equally into six installments and fill them out in the blank space for the face value of the bond on the left side of the application form. It has been approved that payments will begin on July 31. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has also determined the method for the seventh installment of principal and interest on the Renaissance Bonds due at the end of August and the twelfth installment of principal and interest on the Long-Term Financial Bonds due at the end of September. Although the details of the method have not been announced, according to the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency, the method is roughly the same as the payment method for unified government bonds.</p>
<h3>Money Shop Funds: Supply Exceeds Demand; Exert All Available Resources; Strive to Protect National Goods</h3>
<p>Since the member money shops in this city have completed the long-term transfer and loan interest settlement at the end of June, they will make every effort to lend to new and old customers who apply for new loans after careful consideration, so as to stabilize the market. They will exert all available resources to strive to protect the industrial and commercial industries that operate national goods. The rumor that new customers are refused loans is actually a misunderstanding of the refusal of commodity mortgage loans. It is heard that the various transfer and loan shops have thorough preparations for financial funds, and the current situation is that supply exceeds demand.</p>
<h3>After the Recovery of Zhangjiagang, Inland Waterways Resumed Navigation</h3>
<p>Zhangjiagang in Jiangyin has been recovered by the Chinese army. The German merchant ship Changde has resumed sailing and is running smoothly. At the same time, the small steamship service from Zhangjiagang to the inland cities of Changzhou and Wuxi has also been restored. Passenger and cargo transportation is gradually becoming busy. The Italian merchant ships I.A. Nor, etc., have also joined the sailing, making passenger and cargo transportation to and from the inland areas more convenient.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Yunnan Intermodal Transport: Convenient for Merchants; Developed Transportation</h3>
<p>Passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and the inland provinces of Southwest China was changed to be transferred through the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian and Haifang after the outbreak of the war in South China. Currently, the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian have been repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships, and shipping has been affected and suspended. Goods to and from the inland areas have been concentrated in Haifang. Therefore, passenger and cargo transportation on the Haifang line is particularly prosperous. Foreign shipping companies find it difficult to transport goods to Haifang and then to the inland areas, causing goods to pile up like mountains in Haifang, and there is almost no space in the warehouses. Therefore, Shanghai-Yunnan intermodal transport has been implemented to alleviate the situation. Since its implementation, cargo transportation has been convenient, and transportation has therefore become increasingly developed.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Shanghai's Drug Prohibition: What the Director of the Narcotics Department Said When He Resigned; Most of Shanghai's Narcotics Come from Tianjin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Linte, Director of the Narcotics Department of the Public Concession Police, recently resigned and will leave Shanghai for Singapore at the beginning of this week. When interviewed by reporters, Lin stated that there were many things that he could not talk about in his position. However, Mr. Lin did reveal the details of the drug prohibition work. According to him, most of the opium, heroin, or any other narcotics seized in large quantities were seized based on information provided by crew members of ships carrying narcotics to Shanghai. The Narcotics Department of the Police has hired a large number of</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Secret Agents</p>
<p>Chinese detectives are mostly paid according to the results obtained from their intelligence. Some foreigners have fixed salaries. Mr. Lin then spoke of foreign parties engaged in narcotics trading in the past ten years or so, resulting in great wealth. These foreigners residing in this port are of different nationalities, with Central Europeans being the most numerous. The reporter asked how narcotics were</p>
<p>Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Lin replied that previously, these people transported them from Tianjin by rail, but since the outbreak of the war, they have been shipped in fake delivery boxes and suitcases. The general public believes that most of the manufactured opium comes from Shanghai, but this is not the case. Shanghai is only the sales center for narcotics trading in this part of the world.</p>
<p>Seized Opium Overseas</p>
<p>Constantly refers to Shanghai as its origin, but in fact, the source or origin of opium is Tianjin. Currently, the large amount of heroin being transported to the United States and being seized or already transported to the United States is being shipped from Hong Kong. An important feature of narcotics trading is that many carriers are completely innocent and may not even know that they are</p>
<p>Smuggling Narcotics</p>
<p>Groups that smuggle and sell narcotics often take many years to form, and those who wish to join must work as apprentices for many years before they gain their trust and are allowed to work internally. However, those who smuggle narcotics risk their own freedom and everything. It is said that there are those who continue to engage in this even after they have become wealthy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Bomb Taizhou; More Than Twenty Japanese Warships Gather in the Waters of Pingtan Chuanshi</h3>
<p>Cable from shipping industry in Shanghai, on the 15th at 8:00 AM, 3 Japanese warships appeared in the waters of Taizhou, Eastern Zhejiang and deployed speedboats, patrolling the coast and detaining several sailing vessels, and at 9:00 AM, they fired more than ten shots at the shore before leaving. The Japanese warships are testing the strength of the Chinese army and disturbing the rear. The Chinese army is heavily guarded along the coast of Haimen. On the 14th, 3 Japanese warships arrived in the waters of Zhenhai Ligang and left on the afternoon of the 15th. The situation along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang is peaceful.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Attempt</p>
<p>Recently, the navigation industry received a cable stating that more than twenty Japanese warships have gathered in the waters of Pingtan Chuanshi in the Min River Estuary, deploying boats, patrolling and spying along the coast. The attempt of the strengthened joint defense between Fujian and Zhejiang is even more consolidated.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Passengers</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo passenger transport cable has been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters and the military authorities, and forwarded to the Shanghai shipping company for notification. Passengers coming to Shanghai from Ningbo will continue to follow the regulations of the Provisional Measures for Navigation in Eastern Zhejiang for the issuance of travel permits. That is, young men leaving the country must have two stores as guarantors with more than 2,000 yuan, and they must return within a limited time. The elderly, young children, and women can be issued permits based on their household registration identity cards from the township offices. Merchants purchasing goods will still be transferred by the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. Civil servants of various agencies and units will be issued permits by their original service agencies.</p>
<h3>Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Will Return to Shanghai from North China Tomorrow; Coming to Shanghai to Greet the New Commander for Regular Turnover; Scheduled to Return to the U.S. Next Month to Meet President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Admiral Yuanar, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, has completed his three-year term and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on August 1 and go directly to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt. His new commander will be Rear Admiral Hull, former Chairman of the General Board of the Navy in Washington. Rear Admiral Hull departed from the U.S. on the President Coolidge on June 30 and stayed in Honolulu.</p>
<p>A Little Relaxation</p>
<p>He arrived in China on the President Coolidge on the 5th of this month to take over his post. Admiral Yuanar is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from North China on the U.S. ship Augusta tomorrow (the 18th) to greet the new commander. The ship will be docked at the head of the naval ship row in the Huangpu River, and it is stipulated that the</p>
<p>Handover Date</p>
<p>Will be the 25th of this month. A grand ceremony will be held on the rear deck of the flagship Augusta. First, Commander Yuanar will read the order, and then the duties of the fleet commander will be transferred to Rear Admiral Hull. Rear Admiral Hull will then read the order in front of the officers and men of the flagship, stating that he has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the military, and then the flag of Commander Yuanar</p>
<p>Will Be Removed</p>
<p>Replaced by the flag of Commander Hull. After Rear Admiral Hull takes over as commander of the Asiatic Fleet, he will be promoted to admiral. According to Rear Admiral Hull, he and Commander Yuanar are close friends. After taking over as commander of the Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai, he will continue to carry out Commander Yuanar's planned plans. When Rear Admiral Hull was in Honolulu, he praised Commander Yuanar for the</p>
<p>Difficulties Faced During the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>According to Hull, Hull was born in Davis, Michigan, U.S. in 1877 and is now 62 years old. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929. In 1935, he served as Chairman of the General Board of the Navy in Washington.</p>
<p>Recently Resigned</p>
<p>He participated in two battles in the Spanish World War and has a good political record. General Hull's term as commander of the Asiatic Fleet will last until July 1, 1941, when General Hull will be 60 years old. As for Admiral Yuanar, after his resignation, he is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the country on the President Coolidge on August 1, first going to Washington to meet with President Roosevelt to receive awards.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Releases Industrial Overview for June: Shortage of Raw Silk and Cocoons Is Worrying; Price Index Rises Again</h3>
<p>Industry Meetings</p>
<p>A meeting of small light bulb factories was convened last month, and another meeting was held this month. Progress has been made in discussions on the standards that the industry should comply with. At the same time, a meeting of leather factories near the Fanhuangdu Station was also held. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to open a well in Ziliujing to be used as a public well for 13 leather factories. It has now been decided to open another meeting to discuss sedimentation ponds.</p>
<p>Accident Statistics</p>
<p>There were 175 industrial accidents, including nine fatal accidents and fourteen female workers injured. There were 45 accidents involving machinery, two of which were fatal, and fourteen female workers were injured. There were 12 accidents involving belts and linkages, and 7 accidents involving calendering machines, etc. There were 21 accidents in the transportation industry, with 32 workers falling and 26 being crushed. Five people were injured by electric shock, three of whom died. Seven people were injured by explosions, one of whom died. Five people were burned by molten metal, one of whom died. There were 22 factory fires, five of which were related to celluloid, with six injuries and two deaths. There were five fires in the weaving industry, with one injury. There were two fires each in the lumber, machinery, hardware, and food and beverage industries. There was one fire each in the house construction, chemical, clothing, and transportation industries, with a total of eight injuries and two deaths.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index</p>
<p>The total index of workers' living expenses, based on the base of 100 in 1936, reached 176.15, setting a new record. It has continued to increase in the past seven months. This month's increase is 6.84% compared to last month and 15.48% compared to June of last year. Therefore, the reciprocal of this month's total index is 56.77. Therefore, the purchasing power of one yuan in 1936 is only worth 0.5677 yuan this month. Compared to last month, the classification is as follows: food increased by 10.94%, miscellaneous items increased by 6.03%, fuel increased by 3.82%, and clothing decreased by 4.21%.</p>
<p>Rice Price Comparison</p>
<p>The section also published a comparison of rice prices over the years. From 1864 to 192, the highest price of japonica rice was 3 yuan to 7 yuan per stone. In 1912, it rose to 9 yuan. In 1920, it rose to 13 yuan. In 1925, it rose to 18 yuan. In 1930, it rose to 23 yuan. The price limit in 1930 was 21. Although the current price limit is nominally the same as in 1930, due to changes in the market system, the current stone of rice is only 85% of what it was then. According to the calculation, the current price limit is actually equal to 24 yuan per stone in 1930. Usually, the rice price accounts for 23.31% of the total consumption of a worker's family. The difficulty of the lives of ordinary workers is evident.</p>
<h3>Contagious Diseases Are Gradually Rampant Among Jewish Refugees in North Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that two cases of scarlet fever and three cases of dysentery have been discovered in the Jewish refugee camp on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek. Because the Zhaofeng Road Refugee Hospital is full, there are no isolation facilities available for these patients, so there is a risk of another contagious disease outbreak.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase: Controlled Exports, Absorbed Overseas Remittances, Secured New Loans, Part of the Issuance Reserve Has Been Converted into Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>After the success of the National Government's legal tender policy, the legal tender reserve cash has always been guaranteed above 60%, while the guarantee is below 40%. It is checked monthly by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to demonstrate its trustworthiness. However, before the war, this cash reserve was stored in the warehouses of major domestic banks. After the war, it has been transported to the UK and the US one after another, either entrusted to be kept in custody or exchanged for foreign exchange and deposited abroad. The current high number of issuance reserves is the highest in the world. Although it has been used to purchase necessary supplies for the war of resistance and maintain market relations, the foreign exchange position under the cash reserve is inevitably slightly reduced. However, due to government purchases and exports, the settlement of foreign exchange by exporters, the collection of gold and silver, the absorption of overseas remittances, and the establishment of new foreign loans, the foreign exchange reserves have been replenished and increased successively. As for the concerns that funds would flow into foreign banks after the restriction on withdrawals from Malayan dollars, because foreign commercial banks are not subject to the restrictions, the facts have proved that the above-mentioned situation has not occurred.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Military Service for British Nationals in Hong Kong and Shanghai: Rapid Turn of Events in the Far East, British Subjects of Military Age in Both Locations Must Not Evade Service, Hong Kong Government Order Reaches Shanghai</h3>
<p>British nationals in Shanghai received an order from the Hong Kong government on the evening of the 15th regarding the conscription of British subjects of military age in Hong Kong, who have been ordered to participate in Hong Kong's defense work. Young British nationals in Shanghai must also serve and may not evade service. It is reported that the implementation of this compulsory military service aims to form a strong reserve force, similar in nature to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This emergency measure by the Hong Kong government is likely related to the rapid turn of events in the Far East.</p>
<p>According to a mainland newspaper, an informal source among British residents in Shanghai stated yesterday that British nationals in Shanghai may not be subject to the intensive training stipulated in this week's order from the Hong Kong government. This is because the strong and fit young British nationals in Shanghai have already joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and Shanghai lacks the facilities to accommodate long-term, continuous training for a large group. Moreover, in times of peace, British nationals in Shanghai and Hong Kong are governed differently. However, in the event of war, military law would, of course, be fairly applied to every British person fit for combat.</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing Advocates Developing the Petroleum Industry: Imports Exceed 100 Million Annually, Fluid from Zigong Contains Oily Components</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has been advocating for the development of the petroleum industry, issuing a statement to all sectors, stating that humanity is advancing daily, science is flourishing, the volume of production is increasing, and the needs of society are becoming more pressing. This is the evolution of the times to meet the balance of supply and demand. China is a historically long-standing agricultural nation, with natural resources that surpass all others in the world. Most of the raw materials needed by various countries are supplied by China. The provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu are particularly rich in minerals. The saying "real treasures are like forests, and resources block the roads" is not an exaggeration. Westerners regard China as a land of gold, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>However, the widespread presence of gold has instead attracted the covetousness of ambitious individuals who plot against us day and night. In recent years, the government has been determined to strengthen the country, develop industry, and strive for production. Emerging industries are also springing up like bamboo shoots after rain, gradually reaching a point where they can compete with advanced countries. It is a pity that scientific progress has been slow, and inventions are few.</p>
<p>The petroleum needed for national defense, military supplies, and daily civilian use still relies on other countries, which is truly alarming. Originally, the petroleum industry was operated by American merchants. When it first entered China, it only met the fuel needs of the people. Later, with the development of industry, all the motive power of machinery relied on petroleum. The consumption was huge, and the economic losses increased. According to customs records,</p>
<p>The amount of imports exceeds 100 million annually. The magnitude of the figure and the amount of the leak are alarming. Mr. Yu Shunqing of Yin County has been studying petroleum, which is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, for many years. In the past, he did not shy away from difficulties and dangers, going to Sichuan four times to conduct on-site investigations. In the Zigong area, he discovered a large amount</p>
<p>of gas, a liquid with a black color and foul odor, originally regarded as waste by the locals. After several studies, it was confirmed to contain oily components. He immediately moved the raw materials back to Shanghai and asked Mr. Shen Xiongqing, a technician and director of the Industrial Testing Institute of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, to conduct a chemical analysis. The results were quite good, yielding gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil. A report and certificate were issued. Since he has obtained the benefits of natural resources, he should actively proceed. How can he give up due to a minor setback? Moreover, materials that are discarded can satisfy our</p>
<p>pressing needs, which is of great benefit to the country and a contribution to society. It is more than just plugging a leak. Furthermore, during this period of national crisis, regardless of light or heavy industry, everything is developing in the interior. Sichuan Province has always been known as the "Land of Abundance." Operating this industry here is suitable for both the time and the place. This is also an excellent opportunity for investors. I have heard that comrades are gathering to formulate plans</p>
<p>to engage in development, turning decay into magic, and building the country through production. I appreciate their ambition and support their success. I am happy to introduce them and hope that celebrities from the government and the public, as well as industrial experts, will rise up and contribute their talents and resources to achieve this goal as soon as possible. This may well be the dawn of self-reliance.</p>
<h3>Rubber Industry: Sales Improve, Factories Resume Operations, Five New Factories Established</h3>
<p>Since Hankou, Guangzhou, and Nanchang successively fell, domestic sales of all national goods relied solely on eastern Zhejiang. After the implementation of the blockade of various seaports in Zhejiang, sales of national goods were limited to Shanghai. Therefore, the rubber industry reduced production. Now, as summer arrives and the Dragon Boat Festival approaches, sales of white sneakers and galoshes have shown a slight upturn. Therefore, various factories have increased production. Currently, the factories that are in operation include Da Zhonghua, Jiaotong, Da Shanghai, Minsheng, Guanghua, Huafeng, Yisheng, Hongda, Yongqin, Likang, Yuanyuan, Wuhua, Guotai, Yonghe, and Nanyang, a total of fifteen factories, an increase of five factories compared to last month.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Vessels Not Yet Returned, Crew Dismissed, China-America Navigation Company Also Implementing Reductions</h3>
<p>Regarding the dozen or so Portuguese merchant ships that were previously seized because the Japanese side deemed their nationality unclear, and moored at Yangshupu's pontoon buoys, the former Portuguese Consul-General to Shanghai, Mr. Alves, and the new Consul, Mr. Melo, repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consul, Mr. Miura, and naval authorities. The situation had originally progressed, and there was considerable hope for their return. Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the negotiations now seem to have stalled again. The seized vessels have not been returned. As a result, the various Portuguese shipping companies have been unable to maintain operations due to the suspension of business for more than three months. Most of the internal and shipboard staff, except for a few key personnel, have been temporarily dismissed with compensation to avoid excessive losses. In addition, the China-America Navigation Company, which represents Portuguese shipping interests, has also implemented reductions. Mr. Li Yaoting, the Chinese manager of the company, has resigned from the company to start his own Hong An Dyeing and Weaving Factory.</p>
<h3>Wife of French Ambassador Heads North for Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 16th that the wife of French Ambassador Cosme, along with her daughter, took Swire Company's Shun Tian steamer to Beidaihe for a summer vacation.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Reach 15,000, Another 200 Arrive, Sent to Shelters</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that 200 Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) aboard the "Grakshinna" steamer, bringing the total number of Jewish refugees in the city to approximately 15,500. The newcomers went from the Gonghexiang Wharf to various shelters prepared in advance in the Yuyuan area.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's June Public Works Report: Council Properties Damaged by War: Three Repaired, Three Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>Last month, the painting project of the Old Rubbish Bridge began. The water pipe railings and steps on the Bund embankment have been completed. The construction of six new sedimentation tanks in the West District Sewage Disposal Plant has been completed and put into use. The expansion and repair of the McKinley Tuberculosis Sanatorium have also been completed. The houses and all equipment of the Hongkou Open-Air Swimming Pool have been repaired, and the pool water has been filtered and replaced to be opened in early July. Some Council properties were damaged by the war, and those that have been repaired include the foreign isolation hospital on Bazilu, the Songpanlu vegetable market, and the sports equipment storage in Hongkou Park. Those under repair include the Shanghai Municipal Council Prison on Ward Road, the Huishan Vegetable Market, and the warehouse in Hongkou Park. Emergency sanitation work in the squatter settlement area outside the West District, such as the removal of garbage, the excavation of ditches, the cleaning of river floods, the burial of corpses, and the filling of polluted land, is proceeding as usual. A total of 662 new houses are under construction, and 193 new houses have been valued for tax collection. A total of 407 construction drawings were submitted for review, and 220 were approved. Public Works Department inspectors inspected a total of 9,862 new buildings.</p>
<h3>Philippine Consul Yang Guang-sheng Promotes Sino-Philippine Friendship</h3>
<p>Since taking office last winter, Mr. Yang Guang-sheng, the Consul-General to the Philippines, has had very harmonious relations in all aspects. Sino-Philippine friendship has been growing daily. Earlier this month, Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon hosted a banquet to entertain Consul-General Yang and his wife.

<h3>Zhejiang Specialty Products Management Office Formulates Cocoon Merchant Registration Rules: Strict Management to Promote Production, Approved and Implemented by the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>In order to strictly manage cocoon merchants and promote production, the Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office has formulated Cocoon Merchant Registration Rules, which have been submitted to the Provincial Government for record and implementation. The rules are recorded as follows: (1) The Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office formulates these rules specifically to manage cocoon merchants; (2) Before each cocoon harvest season, cocoon merchants should collect registration application forms from this office or various branch offices (the locations and registration dates of various branch offices will be announced separately), fill them out, and submit them to the respective branch offices for review and transfer. After being reviewed and approved by this office, a license will be issued before they are allowed to operate. Those who do not obtain a license must not operate without authorization. Those who violate this rule will be ordered to close down by the local administrative authorities. The registration form will be formulated separately. Cocoon merchants jointly established by the cocoon industry production cooperatives in various counties should also register in accordance with the provisions of these rules; (3) The establishment of cocoon merchants will be determined according to the following criteria: 1. The number of improved silkworm seeds distributed by the cocoon merchant is more than 2,000 sheets; 2. The output of fresh cocoons near the location of the cocoon merchant is more than 500 piculs; 3. The cocoon merchant has four or more double stoves; 4. The transportation in the location of the cocoon merchant is relatively convenient; 5. It is estimated that the cocoon merchant's cocoon collection and baking fees are sufficient to cover the minimum operating expenses; (4) All cocoon merchants approved to operate should repair and complete the stoves and all necessary equipment after receiving the license and submit the trade license fee to the county government, which will then transfer it to the Finance Department for verification and collection, and issue a business license; (5) Cocoon merchants shall adopt a contract baking system for cocoon collection. The minimum amount is calculated at 30 piculs of fresh cocoons per double stove, and the maximum amount shall not exceed 120 piculs of fresh cocoons per double stove; (6) The contract baking fee for fresh cocoons is calculated at 3.60 yuan per picul for each stove within 30 piculs. If it exceeds 30 piculs, the baking fee will be reduced by 0.20 yuan per picul for every additional 10 piculs, down to 2.40 yuan; (7) The maximum and minimum amounts of baked cocoons and the contract baking fees for machine stoves are calculated as ten double stoves; (8) Cocoon merchants should register once for each cocoon season, and no fees will be charged; (9) These rules will be implemented after being submitted by the Construction Department to the Provincial Government for record.</p>
<h3>Situation in Tianjin Still Deadlocked: Soviets Prevented from Coming to Shanghai: Even Shirts of Britons Were Removed, Food and Milk Supply Insufficient</h3>
<p>According to a mainland newspaper, the Soviet Consul in Tianjin and two other Soviets were stopped by Japanese soldiers on the Hai River last Wednesday on their way from Tianjin to Tanggu and forced to leave the dock, unable to board Jardine Matheson's Taishun. Two of the Soviets intended to take the ship to Shanghai, while the Soviet Consul did not intend to come here, only accompanying the other two to board the ship. It is unknown whether the three returned directly to Tianjin or were detained by the Japanese army. This news was reported by a foreigner who arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on the Taishun. The Taishun was delayed until 4:15 p.m. yesterday due to carrying a lot of cargo. According to other passengers on the ship, the situation in Tianjin is currently deadlocked, and everything has only slightly eased. A British national stated that when he entered the British Concession in Tianjin last Sunday, he saw a British resident's shirt being removed. The supply of fresh food and milk in the Tianjin Concession is completely insufficient, business is stagnant, and the general public is quite resentful of the situation.</p>
<h3>Stealing a Half-Day of Leisure: Collective Report: 1. A Midsummer Garden Scene</h3>
<p>The summer climate is not necessarily annoying. If there are thin dark clouds in the sky, obscuring the scorching sun, and you stand under an ancient tree that can be embraced, you will definitely feel green all over and a coolness.</p>
<p>This kind of situation, like in Zhongshan Park in Beiping, can be encountered almost anytime. There are ancient cypresses with high ages, their branches and leaves interweaving, a green sky and green ground. Taking a walk in the early morning and afternoon, you will feel the loveliness of summer?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, not to mention the myriad of dust and noise, willing to choose reality, not yearning for the clouds of Mount Lu, nor is it necessary to say that there is nowhere to go. If you are not thinking of the bamboo of Mogan Mountain, you can take a trip to Zhaofeng Park in the western suburbs for half a day of leisure, and you will surely be able to temporarily cast aside all your troubles. Here there are small bridges and flowing water, ancient trees and pines, and even earthen mounds to climb.</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Park certainly cannot be compared with Zhongshan Park in Beiping. Each has its own strengths, without distinction. In my personal opinion, Zhongshan Park is quite ancient. Its special features are its cloisters, curved railings, and waterside pavilions, which are for "literati" to visit. A game of Go, plus a pot of scented tea, can be carefree and linger all day long. The characteristics of Zhaofeng Park lie in its gorgeousness, liveliness, flatness, and delicacy. Walking in a hurry, watching in a hurry, it does not allow you to be sluggish and linger, nor does it allow you to see everything at a glance. Although it has no ancient charm, it is just right.</p>
<p>Because everyone is feeling sad about the life of an isolated island every day, everyone is a little depressed. On the suggestion of Mr. S., we made a trip to Zhaofeng Park on Sunday and waited by the pool. We are all middle-aged people, but the active temperament of youth is still maintained to some extent. Sleeping late at midnight, we can still get up early, and everyone arrives at the scheduled time. So, carrying a camera case, we started walking.</p>
<p>It should start from when you enter the park gate. What is revealed in front of you is a curved, wide, and very long cement road. Looking around, the atmosphere of green makes people feel refreshed. Walking along the road, on the right is a winding small river, with duckweed and algae growing fully. On the left is a large green square, and in the center of the square is a very large pond. The grass on the bank of the pond is undulating, with weeping willows, evergreens, and a thatched pavilion. Chairs are placed casually around the riverbank for adults to sit and rest, and children are paddling boats on the pond. This is a contour of what you see after entering the park. If you describe it in detail, it would be a bit of a waste of ink! I will write about the wonderfulness of this park.</p>
<p>The wonderfulness of Zhaofeng Park lies in the slope of the grassland. Looking from a distance, it does not feel ordinary. Although the land is very wide and vast, it is mostly designed according to the natural terrain. There are several places with large trees, several places with small pavilions, and stone benches are arranged in the curved and secluded places. Even in some places, the grassland extends down the slope, and the eyesight is exhausted, and you cannot see the end at a glance.</p>
<p>Moreover, this park uniquely has many small paths. Surrounded by green shade, it seems that there is nowhere to go. Upon closer inspection, there is a pebble path. Although it is short, it is very poetic. If you linger on these small stone paths on a moonlit night, with the moonlight all over the ground, clear and quiet, you will definitely feel like you are not in this world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although there is no running water in the park, there are also small streams running underground in secluded places, and small bridges are built on top. The construction of the bridge is very simple and elegant, all made of wooden sections. It is flat like a thoroughfare or raised like a hump, changing shape according to the location, appearing unconventional.</p>
<p>In the western part of the park, a new earthen mound was built. From the bottom to the top, it is dozens of steps large, all paved with stone steps and planted with green bamboo, like the Taoguang Bamboo Path in Hangzhou. We looked out from the top of the mountain for a long time, and the green trees, thatched pavilions, the reflection of the waves and clouds were all in full view, with the charm of a misty landscape.</p>
<p>After wandering like this for half a day, it is truly what is called walking in a hurry and watching in a hurry, experiencing the coolness of summer under ancient pines like Zhang Hua's canopy. Everyone also thought of the ancient cypresses in Zhongshan Park in Beiping; what is gratifying is that we are not disappointed, we all have the confidence to travel north together, it is not a hopeless thing.</p>
<p>The teacher said: Dreams may be realised. We are not in a dream, why not step on the path of light? (Jingxing)</p>

<h3>Famous Female Peking Opera Singer Xue Youqin's Costumes and Jewelry Stolen, Her Stage Assistant Guan Wanyou's Bad Behavior and Unrepentant Nature Leads to Six Months' Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Guan Wanyou, a native of Beiping who was the stage assistant for the famous female Peking opera singer Xue Youqin, had served her for many years, managing all of Xue's costumes and props. In recent years, Guan's behavior had deteriorated. He once stole items belonging to his mistress, and after Xue berated him, he had friends and relatives intercede on his behalf. He begged for forgiveness and promised to reform, so Xue allowed him to continue working as before. However, Guan's</p>
<p>thieving heart resurfaced, and he secretly stole items for pawn. Xue did not notice at first, but on the evening of the 12th of this month, while Xue was putting on makeup backstage at the Tianchan Theatre, she asked Guan to fetch a mirror. However, Guan had already pawned the mirror at the Changsheng Pawnshop during the day, so he could not provide it. After Guan stammered an explanation, Xue still did not suspect that he had stolen it. However, Guan felt guilty and dared not linger. While his mistress was performing on stage, he quietly fled. Later,</p>
<p>Xue finished singing and returned to her residence at No. 4 Renheli, Guling Road. Not seeing Guan return all night, she became suspicious. She checked the items he was managing and found that 67 costumes, 5 knives, 1 sword, 10 silver ornaments, and 7 steel items were missing, totaling a value of a thousand gold. It must have been Guan who stole them. She searched in all directions but found no clues. The next day at dusk, Xue's relative Zhai Shuliang passed by Ma Hall Road and unexpectedly encountered Guan. Zhai already knew that Guan had stolen his mistress's belongings and fled, so he called the police.</p>
<p>Guan was taken into the News Police Station. Under investigation, Guan admitted that he had started stealing costumes on February 11th of this year, pawning them at the Dechang Pawnshop on Parker Road a total of 34 times, receiving over 210 yuan in pawn money. All the pawn tickets were still preserved. The head detective immediately ordered the surrender of the pawn tickets and sent Deputy Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Yang Feizhang to recover the stolen goods. The day before yesterday, Guan was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Meng Tingke interrogated him. Xue was also summoned</p>
<p>to confront him. After the actress explained the case to the police station's lawyer Qian Xunjiu, she recounted the defendant's past behavior and the facts of this theft and escape. However, Guan Wanyou claimed that he stole because his mistress owed him wages. Xue then supplemented her statement, saying that Guan indeed owed her money and she had not shorted his salary. Guan then lowered his head and remained silent. The court immediately sentenced Guan to six months' imprisonment, and the stolen goods were to be redeemed by the owner at her own expense.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Joins Forces with French Police to Search for Days</h3>
<p>A Hotel Room in Great Shanghai Searched, Traveler Out, Nothing Found</p>
<p>At 4:00 AM yesterday, more than ten Japanese personnel went to the French Police Department, requesting them to send Chinese and Western detectives to assist in searching Room 8230 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on East Xinqiao, Avenue Edward VII. It happened that the guest in that room had gone out the night before and had not returned, so nothing was found. After the search, no prohibited items were found either.</p>
<h3>Stroke While Playing Mahjong, Dies Laughing</h3>
<p>Ye Huajin, an 18-year-old native of Wuxi, lived at No. 26, Lane 886, Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai West, earning a living nearby. Last night, he invited friends to play mahjong at home for entertainment. Around 10:00 PM, Ye drew a card and completed a hand with all one suit, getting rich with a matched pong of middle. He was extremely happy. Later, he drew another card, and as he pushed the tiles down, he laughed once and immediately fell to the ground and died. His friends were greatly alarmed and quickly called a car to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was found that there was no way to save him, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Continued Interrogation of Extortion of School Principal</h3>
<p>Xu Hao, a native of Jiading who served as a teacher at Hengmao Elementary School at No. 87, Hengmao Lane, Baixianqiao, recently colluded with Yao Tingsen, a local who worked in the Public Concession Police Department on Jing'an Temple Road, and Yue Qiuxin, a Cantonese, claiming that the school principal Yang Guoping had not obtained a permit from the French Municipal Council and had privately built a four-story loft in the school. They impersonated officials from the donation department of the French Municipal Council and extorted 1,000 gold from Yang. After the incident was exposed, Yao and others were arrested and transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday was another scheduled continuation of the trial. The plaintiff Yang Guoping hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested an incidental civil suit for 370 yuan. However, the police record stated that the investigation was not yet complete and requested a further extension. After reviewing the statements, the court summoned each defendant for questioning and then adjourned the hearing to the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Two Hand Grenades Found at Asia Petroleum Station on Nanjing Road, Workers Discovered Them, Fortunately Did Not Explode, Truth of Placement Under Investigation</h3>
<p>At approximately 6:00 AM yesterday, two hand grenades were found abandoned in the open space of the Asia Petroleum Station at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. Fortunately, they did not explode. The hand grenades all had wooden handles, resembling taro, and were black. They were placed in the open space about a foot away from the petroleum. The first to discover them was Xue Ergen, a worker at the station. When he rode his bicycle to the station to take over the shift, he caught sight of the explosives and immediately informed Hua Bu No. 21. Hua Bu No. 21 relayed to the Central Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene and take away the two hand grenades. The intention of the person who placed the grenades is still unknown. The police authorities are currently investigating the source and truth of the hand grenades.</p>
<h3>Scheme to Alter Check for Fraudulent Withdrawal, Bank Clerk Unrelated, Zhou Liankui Granted Release</h3>
<p>Recently, the China Industrial Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road discovered that someone had altered a check of the Yongxin Linen Weaving Company, an account that had already been canceled, and forged the signature and seal of another account holder, Ge Yanqing, fraudulently withdrawing 300 yuan of national currency. When Ge tried to withdraw money, the bank returned it, claiming insufficient funds. After Ge negotiated with the bank, the bank manager Wang Boyuan reported it to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Qian Xianting, they believed that Zhou Liankui, a Ningbo native and employee of the bank, was suspected and arrested him, transferring him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Now, after investigation by the police station, it was determined that there was no conclusive evidence of Zhou's involvement in the case. Therefore, the police station's lawyer Jiang Baolian applied to the First Special Court to stop the detention of Zhou Liankui and release him. After deliberation, Magistrate Feng Shide ordered that Zhou Liankui be granted release from detention.</p>
<h3>Female Servant Convicted of Theft</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang, the main character in a comedy film in the movie industry, 39 years old, a native of Nanjing, lives at No. 6, Lane 383, Ladu Road, French Concession. Recently, a newly hired maid, surnamed Wang, seized the opportunity to steal all of Tang's ordinary and filming suits, worth over 100 yuan, and pawned them for use. After Tang discovered it, he reported it to the French Police Department, and Detective Gao Jinsheng arrested Wang and recovered the stolen goods. The day before yesterday, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police station's lawyer prosecuted according to the law. The plaintiff Tang Jie appeared in court to recount the theft and the circumstances of the discovery. When questioned, Wang pleaded guilty. After reviewing the confession, the magistrate sentenced Wang to two months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, and the stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Three Petty Thieves Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>The thugs Zhu Jingui (21 years old, from Yangzhou), Yin Dongmai (19 years old, from Hangzhou), and Chen Honglin (24 years old, from Yancheng) colluded, specializing in selling "foreign devils" as a pretext to attract people to watch and then steal. At 3:00 PM on the 14th of this month, Zhu and the other two stood in front of No. 64, Ximen Road, French Concession. Zhu placed a newborn speckled rabbit in a Great Britain brand cigarette box and shouted to sell foreign rabbits. Pedestrians were curious and stopped to watch, while Yin and Chen stole. It happened that Jin Zhu San, a Zhenjiang native working at the World Amusement Park inside No. 64, also went forward to watch and was robbed of a wallet containing two yuan and two corners in paper money and a World pass. After discovering it, he reported it to the French Police Department, and Detective Ke Enqi arrested the three criminals Zhu, Yin, and Chen. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation to see if they had committed other crimes and then to be tried. After questioning by Magistrate Miao, they were ordered to be interrogated again on the 20th, and the defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Broad Daylight in Fahua</h3>
<p>At approximately 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, four robbers speaking with a Hakka accent and wearing Xiangyun gauze short shirts and pants suddenly arrived at the Shunchang Clock and Watch Shop in Fahua East Town, Shanghai West. One of them held a gun, and another was on the lookout outside. The other three went inside and robbed over 40 yuan in French currency and seven watches from the counter drawer. After stealing the goods, they broke into the Jiangyuan Sauce Garden Shop on the west side and robbed dozens of yuan in French currency from the counter.</p>

<h3>Bank Accountant Embezzles Over 40,000 Yuan, Exploits Water Sprinkling and Transfers for Profit, Ultimately Losing Everything in Gambling Den, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Fang Xile, a Cantonese employee of the accounting department of the Dandong Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road, was addicted to gambling, resulting in insufficient income. He devised a way to embezzle funds. His method of embezzlement involved cases where depositors entrusted the bank to remit money abroad. Assuming that the money remitted at the time of remittance was equivalent to 100 yuan in Chinese currency based on the foreign currency exchange rate, and by the time of settlement, due to changes in market prices, the exchange rate required 130 yuan in Chinese currency, the bank would charge the customer based on 130 yuan. The bank would then have a surplus of 30 yuan. Fang, by virtue of his position, took this surplus for himself. In this way, over the years, Fang embezzled no less than tens of thousands of gold, but lost it all in gambling dens. Recently, Fang's fraudulent activities were discovered by the bank, and they reported it to the Silk Patrol Police Station. Chinese Detectives Jiang Shangpei and Yang Peisheng arrested Fang and transferred him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Magistrate Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court for continued interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that he was now prosecuting based on Article 336 of the Criminal Law for fraud and Article 217 for forgery. According to the investigation, Fang embezzled a total of over 40,000 yuan, and should be punished according to the law. Fang also hired lawyer Rong Zhenlong to defend him, but he did not dispute the accusations. After detailed questioning by the court, he ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin their arguments, announced the conclusion, and scheduled the sentencing for next Thursday.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Monk Murder Case Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhao Kong, a monk from Tongzhou staying at Fuguo Temple at No. 4725 Labourdonnais Road, mixed poison, "oxalic acid," with yellow spirits because his request for money was unsuccessful, and then mixed it into tiger bone papaya wine, intending to poison the abbot Monk Kongci, but failed. It was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which detained him and transferred him to the First Special Court, prosecuting him for attempted murder.

Shi Chenglang, the cook, was arrested on suspicion and transferred to the First Special Court, which sentenced him to one year and two months' imprisonment. Shi was dissatisfied with the sentence, and his pro bono lawyer Wang Xiaowen drafted an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court on his behalf. After investigation and conclusion by Court President Yu, the original judgment was overturned, and Shi Chenglang was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Suicide Attempts</h3>
<p>Apprentice Hangs Himself Wei Yongsen, an 18-year-old local apprentice at Yuanchang Pawnshop at No. 1740 North Shansi Road, Public Concession, had an argument with another apprentice at approximately 3:50 PM yesterday, which escalated into a physical fight. After mediation, the matter was resolved. However, Jiang was stubborn and became despondent. He took the opportunity to enter the room and hang himself. He was discovered by someone, who quickly tried to save him, but he was already barely breathing. It was reported to the Huisi Police Station, which ordered Patrolman No. 158 to rush to the scene and call an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was said that he had been hanging for too long and his life was in danger.</p>
<p>Student Takes Poison Xia Shicai, a 22-year-old Shanghai native residing at No. 3, Lane 277, Wenlin Road, French Concession, was a student at a certain middle school. For unknown reasons, he swallowed medicine and attempted suicide at approximately 8:00 PM last night. He was discovered by his family and taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. His poisoning was severe, and his life was in critical condition.</p>
<p>Indignant Young Woman Commits Suicide Jiang Xingqin, a 25-year-old woman with deceased parents, currently lives in the front building at No. 59 Beijie, Xujiahui Town. Her husband, Hu Zhifu, also known as Zhang Di, is a businessman who occasionally comes to Shanghai. Her aunt, Zhang, is very fierce, so Jiang is often abused. As a result, the aunt and daughter-in-law live separately. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Zhang came to scold her again. Overcome with resentment, Xingqin became despondent and secretly purchased opium to commit suicide at approximately 4:00 PM in the afternoon. She was discovered by her housemate and rushed to Yanci Hospital for treatment. It was reported that she had ingested a large amount of poison and her life was in danger.</p>
<p>Woman Hangs Herself Shen Qian, a 48-year-old local woman, lives at No. 14, Xinyu Lane, Zhuanbang, Shanghai West. Recently, her husband lost his job, and her son was ill with no money for medical treatment, causing her great anxiety. She became despondent and secretly hanged herself in the room in the front. By the time her family discovered her and tried to save her, her body was already cold as ice, and there was no way to revive her.</p>
<p>Unable to Live On Cheng Biao Wang A'gen, a 22-year-old Shanghai native residing at No. 91 Jiaofan Village, Lane 877 Foch Road, became despondent due to economic pressure.

At midnight, the teahouse attendant discovered him and reported it to the sweepers. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by car, but the treatment was ineffective. He died yesterday afternoon. The police took the body to the coroner's office for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Angered by Wife's Affair, Splashes Acid and is Arrested, Husband Instigates Fellow Townsman to Harm Lover, Backfires, Husband Also Arrested</h3>
<p>Shi Biao, a 36-year-old merchant from Chongming, lives in the garage at No. 682 Rue Massenet. Shi's wife, Jin, is 32 years old and has some looks, but is naturally flirtatious. Recently, she had an affair with Lu Shangxian (36 years old), a fellow townsman who works as a comprador at No. 108, Room 1, Gōngsìfáng Building 455, Avenue Lafayette.</p>
<p>A month ago, while Lu and Jin were walking hand-in-hand on the street, they were spotted by Shi Biao, who slapped Jin twice on the spot. Afterwards, Shi often quarreled with and beat Jin. At the same time, he hated Lu to the bone and thought of revenge. Until recently, Shi instigated his fellow townsman Ni Afang (35 years old, who runs a butcher shop at No. 59 Xicheng Lane, Route Massenet) to use</p>
<p>acid to harm</p>
<p>Lu Shangxian. Three days ago, Shi gave Ni five yuan to buy a bottle of acid. At approximately 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Ni used a teacup to fill it with acid and lay in wait next to the toilet inside No. 455, where Lu lived, because Shi knew that Lu would definitely go to the toilet around 5:00 AM in the morning, so he instructed Ni to lie in wait there. When the time came,</p>
<p>Lu indeed arrived.</p>
<p>At 5:30, Lu went to the toilet. Just as he was stepping out, Ni rushed up, ready to raise the cup and splash it on Lu's face, but Lu was quick-witted and used his left hand to block. At this time, Ni was flustered, and all the acid in the cup spilled on his own face, causing severe burns. Lu immediately called the police on the spot</p>
<p>and arrested Ni, taking him to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, Ni confessed that Shi Biao was the instigator. They then arrested Shi and sent Ni to the hospital, awaiting his recovery before sending him to court for trial.</p>
<h3>Fake "Political Affairs Office" in Nanshi Organizes Housing Registration, Charging One to Five Yuan Per Building, All Businesses Ignore It</h3>
<p>According to people from Nanshi, the fake "Municipal Government," facing financial difficulties, organized a "Land Registration" last year, but as a result of public non-cooperation with the fake authorities, the matter came to nothing. It is learned that the fake authorities, facing financial difficulties and having exhausted all means, the fake "Political Affairs Office" in Nanshi is again organizing "Housing Registration," charging from one to five yuan per building. However, the public still ignores it. After the war, thieves are rampant in Nanshi, and now they are stealing and robbing everywhere, so they are forming groups to privately dismantle houses, selling the bricks and tiles. When the owners report to the fake "police station," the "police station" first asks if they have registered the "Housing," and if they have not "registered," the "police station" says that it will not provide protection.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning Robbery on Xin Zha Road: Bandits Opened Fire, Resisting Arrest; Result: One Bandit Captured, Firearm Seized; Discovery that the Firearm Belonged to the Police Makes Case Extremely Important</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 4:45 AM, a store located at 867 Xin Zha Road was suddenly targeted by a lone bandit carrying a handgun. The bandit barged in and robbed the store of legal tender and pawn tickets before fleeing. Nearby patrol officers, upon hearing the alarm, immediately pursued the bandit while sounding their whistles. The bandit dared to open fire to resist arrest, firing and fleeing along the way. Police officers returned fire. The bandit fled to Lane 464, Shanhaiguan Road, where he was finally captured by Chinese officers. A handgun and two bullets were seized. After investigation, the handgun was identified as a service pistol belonging to the Public Concession Police Department, serial number 559. Police authorities are taking this case very seriously and are currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>According to information gathered by our reporter after the incident, the weapon seized from the captured perpetrator was confirmed by the police investigation to be the same service pistol, number 1670, belonging to the Chinese police officer of the Huizi police station who was fatally attacked with an axe on July 13 while on duty at the Guangdong Refugee Shelter at 834 Peng Road. The pistol had been taken by the assailant at that time. Therefore, the captured perpetrator in this case may be significantly related to the previous case, and a careful and thorough investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Mock Election Ticket Exhibition Concludes</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Mock Election Ticket Exhibition, organized by the Beijing Road Money Exchange Association of this city, has been open for a week. More than 16,000 Chinese and foreign visitors attended. Even during the heavy rain and wind on the 12th, people continued to arrive by car in an endless stream, demonstrating the significance of the event. As the original scheduled time has expired, and other work of the association urgently needs to be carried out, the exhibition was closed last night. It is also reported that this decision was made because the association's premises were too small, causing the guests to be very crowded, and the reception was inadequate, which was quite regrettable. Once the weather cools down in the autumn, the association will hold another side-by-side exhibition of genuine and fake election tickets at a suitable venue, and preparations are currently underway.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Dr. Xu Daoren, who has informed us that the news item in the local news section of the Shen Bao on the 15th of this month, titled "Second Landlord Evicts Third Tenant," contains many inaccuracies. The front and rear buildings at 7 Ruian Lane, Maybaik Road, Xin Zha Road, were rented to a third tenant, Bi Wanshi, for a monthly rent of 35 yuan (20 yuan for the front building and 15 yuan for the rear building) when the Xu family evacuated to the countryside during the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Bi was notified three months ago that the property would be reclaimed for personal use. Bi has now moved back to his hometown in Pudong, and the lease has legally ended. Therefore, the fourth tenant, Pan Zhishan, has no lease relationship with me, so how could he forcibly occupy the house? I reported this to the Xin Zha police station and ordered his removal. Pan Zhishan asked someone to plead on his behalf, and I gave him one and a half months to move out. There was no "dispatch of detectives to investigate and await verification," etc. Therefore, we specially request your newspaper to publish this letter in the "Letter to the Editor" column to clarify the situation and correct the record. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Lawyer Mi Xitong, to the Local News Section of the Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>Overview of National University Curriculum (Part 1): Curriculum, Except for Medical Schools, is Set by Each School, Resulting in Diverse, Repetitive, and Disorganized Subjects</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education recently compiled a detailed statistical overview of the curriculum of colleges and universities nationwide. The following is the information regarding the university curriculum:</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, the university curriculum, except for medical schools, has been set by each school. With so many departments and schools, and without consistent standards, the subjects have become diverse, repetitive, disorganized, and uneven in level. This situation can be seen from the statistics of the subjects offered by universities nationwide. In 1935, the Ministry of Education compiled and arranged the subjects listed in the overviews and course descriptions of excellent universities in the country, and produced a comparative table of required and elective subjects by department. The statistics were based on the same subject in each department, as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Literature Department: 20 schools surveyed (abbreviated as "schools" below), 126 required subjects (abbreviated as "required" below), 134 elective subjects (abbreviated as "elective" below), 260 total required and elective subjects (abbreviated as "total" below). Foreign Literature Department: 21 schools, 69 required, elective details unknown. History Department: 11 schools, 79 required, 60 elective, 139 total. Philosophy Department: 7 schools, 49 required, 94 elective, 143 total. Education Department: 12 schools, 57 required, elective details unknown. Physics Department: 19 schools, 81 required, 90 elective, 171 total. Chemistry Department: 15 schools, 98 required, 84 elective, 182 total. Biology Department: 18 schools, 91 required, 65 elective, 156 total. Mathematics Department: 0 schools, 82 required, 92 elective, 174 total. Geography Department: 3 schools, 55 required, 48 elective, 103 total. Psychology Department: 3 schools, 32 required, elective details unknown. Sociology Department: 7 schools, 66 required, 74 elective, 140 total. Law Department: 27 schools, 108 required, 73 elective, 181 total. Political Science Department: 15 schools, 152 required, 241 elective, 393 total. Economics Department: 13 schools, 110 required, 230 elective, 340 total. Civil Engineering Department: 14 schools, 139 required, 45 elective, 184 total. Electrical Engineering Department: 9 schools, 86 required, 37 elective, 103 total. Chemical Engineering Department: 7 schools, 104 required, 24 elective, 128 total. Mechanical Engineering Department: 11 schools, 104 required, 25 elective, 129 total. Agronomy Department: 14 schools, 105 required, 37 elective, 142 total. Animal Husbandry Department: 10 schools, 103 required, 8 elective, 111 total. Agricultural Administration Department: 2 schools, 62 required, 15 elective, 77 total. Agricultural Economics Department: 6 schools, 63 required, 29 elective, 91 total. Agricultural Chemistry Department: 4 schools, 78 required, 20 elective, 98 total. Sericulture Department: 10 schools, 79 required, 16 elective, 95 total. Banking Department: 8 schools, 101 required, 75 elective, 186 total. Accounting Department: 8 schools, 91 required, 66 elective, 157 total. International Trade Department: 3 schools, 66 required, 33 elective, 99 total. Business Administration Department: 6 schools, 97 required, 61 elective, 168 total.</p>
<p>Although the number of schools on which the above statistics of each department are based is not uniform, ranging from 25 to 2 schools, it can be seen here that the subjects offered are complex. The statistics of each department range from as many as 393 subjects in the Law Department to as few as 77 subjects in the Agricultural Administration Department. This is because the statistics of the Agricultural Administration Department are based on only two schools. The more schools that contribute to the data, the greater the total number of subjects. This is an important manifestation of the diversity and complexity of the subjects offered by each school. Furthermore, an analysis of the content of each school's curriculum reveals the following phenomena:</p>
<p>(1) Inconsistent Common Required Subjects: University regulations and the National Physical Education Law stipulate that the common required subjects for universities are: Party Ideology, Chinese Language, Physical Education, Military Training, and First and Second Foreign Languages. Each school should set up these subjects uniformly. However, in reality, some schools lack one, two, or even three of these subjects. Taking the College of Science as an example, out of 20 schools, only half offer Party Ideology, 16 offer Chinese Language, 19 offer English, 6 offer Physical Education, 11 offer Military Training, and 3 offer a Second Foreign Language. In the College of Engineering, out of 14 schools, only 5 offer Party Ideology, 9 offer Chinese Language, 13 offer English, 3 offer Physical Education, 6 offer Military Training, and 5 offer a Second Foreign Language. In the College of Law, out of 17 schools, 8 offer Party Ideology, 10 offer Chinese Language, 11 offer English, 8 offer Military Training, 1 offers General Physical Education, and 5 offer a Second Foreign Language.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Plans for High School Students' Further Education</h3>
<p>(Xinghua Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department is preparing for the upcoming summer vacation, when the issue of students' further education will need to be addressed in view of the large number of middle schools in the province. The Ministry of Education has been requested by telegram to instruct national universities in Shanghai to expand their enrollment and increase the number of classes in order to accommodate students. In order to facilitate students who wish to go to the rear, a recruiting office has been requested to be set up in Shanghai according to last year's precedent. The ministry is also requested to subsidize the travel expenses of admitted students westward for relief. The Ministry of Education has recently replied by telegram that it will set up a recruiting office in Shanghai for unified enrollment this year. If the quotas of Shanghai schools are full, students will be assigned to schools in the rear based on their grades and preferences. The travel expenses are being planned. It is reported that the Education Department has already issued a notice.</p>
<h3>National Christian Student Representatives Conference Endorsed by Student Unions Nationwide</h3>

<h3>Change of Principals in Taizhou Schools; Provincial Yangzhou Middle School Taizhou Branch to Move to Shanghai; Reorganization of the Board of Directors of Shimin Middle School</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) Chen Dehong, the principal of Taixian County Middle School, has resigned for personal reasons, which has been approved. The Taixian Education Bureau previously recommended three people for the Education Department to select. The county government has now received instructions to appoint Mr. Li, the former director of moral education at the school. After the Education Bureau issues the appointment order, he will begin recruiting students.</p>
<p>The Provincial Yangzhou Middle School Taixian Branch, originally located at the former site of the Mingde Girls' School in Dajiaochang, will move to Shanghai in the next semester and merge with Taizhou School Branch of Yangzhou Middle School because the owner of the original building needs to take it back and it is not easy to find a suitable school site at the moment.</p>
<p>Taixian Private Shimin Middle School has been operating for a long time. In recent years, due to poor management, the Education Department has instructed the school to reorganize its board of directors. Lu Xiaobo has been publicly elected as the chairman of the board of directors, and local people who are enthusiastic about education have been appointed as directors. The school board is currently looking for suitable talent to serve as principal.</p>
<h3>YMCA Boys' Department Summer Service for Refugee Children to Commence Soon</h3>
<p>The Boys' Department of the Shanghai Chinese YMCA is utilizing the summer vacation to train outstanding YMCA members to promote the movement to serve refugee children, in order to assist in the educational activities of various shelters, improve the daily living habits of refugee children, and at the same time enable YMCA members to understand the meaning of their service and improve their service effectiveness. The association originally scheduled the service movement to begin on the 10th of this month, but because the Education and Health Movement Week also opened on that day, YMCA members went to various places to promote health knowledge, so it was not possible to realize it on schedule. Now that the association's Education and Health Movement Week has ended yesterday, the summer service for refugee children movement will soon follow.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Private Shanghai Cup Basketball: Tiger Team Loses Again, Strong Teams Also Win Big; Today Ning Shao Battles</h3>
<p>In the Private Shanghai Cup basketball tournament, yesterday's cup featured a fierce battle between Zhongchu and Zhiqiang, with Zhongchu narrowly winning by one point, making the situation extremely tense. The matches between Qiu Zuyi team and Qun Yi, as well as between Zhongzu Huafan and Shangwu, were also quite close. In the women's group, Qing Bai Hong's victory over Haiguang, and in the men's group, Qianghua's victory over the Tiger Team, both became one-sided. The Tiger Team was quite active yesterday, a stark contrast to their performance against Hualian the day before. Xi Jiaode and Shen Yigu both attacked and defended, showing promise, but Qianghua was more experienced. Xu Tiankui and Zhang Shao Xiang watched from the sidelines, executing their strategies skillfully. After Shen Yigu of the Tiger Team broke the deadlock, Xu and Zhang issued order after order, completing a 16-2 run in one go, deflating the Tiger Team's momentum. Although the Tiger Team briefly revived its spirit, it ultimately succumbed. The first half ended with Qianghua leading 36-19. The final score was 72-38. Yesterday, Xu Wenkui scored 15 points alone, and Zhang Shaoqing scored 20 points, demonstrating Qianghua's strong performance. Today's five matches include two in the women's group, one in Group A, and two in Group B, including Tianxing vs. Qingyou, and Ningshao vs. Pengbi.</p>

<h3>Faber Cup Final Second Leg: Lido and Samsung Draw; 1-1, No Score in the First Half; The Two Teams Will Play the Final Match This Weekend</h3>
<p>The second leg of the Faber Cup Group A final, Lido vs. Samsung, was held yesterday afternoon at the Sino-French Stadium on Albert Road. The audience was as crowded as in the first match, with nearly a thousand people. Lido won the first leg 2-0. If they could win yesterday's match, they would win the championship. However, Samsung played exceptionally hard yesterday, and their attacks dominated Lido's goal for three-fifths of the game. However, Lido's defense was impenetrable, and they could not score. Although Jin Peigen once attacked the center directly, Zhang Mingsheng returned the favor, resulting in a 1-1 draw. According to the rules, extra time should have been played, but both sides agreed not to, and the winner will be decided in the third match next Sunday. The champions of each group in Group B will be determined within this week and will be held at the same time as the final match of Group A.</p>
<p>Match Highlights:</p>
<p>Samsung kicked off and immediately took the offensive. Wu Shaotai headed the ball towards the goal, and the crossbar bounced it back, causing Lido a scare. Lido seized the opportunity to counterattack, and Zhang Mingsheng took two shots, both missing widely. Soon after, Samsung's star player Fan Jinyong injured his wrist in a Lido attack and was replaced by Hong Guangwei. The first half ended 0-0, with no goals scored. After the second half started, Lido Wenliang accidentally handled the ball, resulting in a free kick for Samsung. Wu Shaotai took the kick, which went out of bounds. After that, both sides went back and forth, neither side giving an inch. Twenty minutes later, Jin Peigen received a pass from Wu Shaotai and shot the ball into the net, breaking the deadlock. After Lido conceded, they launched a full-scale counterattack. Zhang Mingsheng went on a solo run and scored, tying the game. Time ran out, and the score was 1-1, with no winner determined. In addition, there were two Group B matches. Zhongyou and Nanmo both won. In a friendly match, Hengchang defeated Youyou.</p>

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Several Distinctions of Women's Lack of Libido</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>It is rare for men to be born with a lack of love; however, it is very common in women. In medicine, it is called "sexual deficiency." There is also weak libido, indifference to sexual intercourse, called "dulled sensitivity." There is also the presence of libido, but without arousing pleasure, called "anorgasmia." There are also cases where the reproductive organs do not have problems, only underdeveloped libido, like a child, called "psychological sexual infantilism." These women often have no romantic love with their husbands, forcing men to satisfy their desires outside the home, leading to a major cause of male prostitution, concubinage, and adultery.</p>
<p>Although some women's lack of libido is due to congenital reasons, it is common in society for men to have dissipated energy, kidney deficiency, and premature ejaculation, failing to satisfy their wives in their sex life. Over time, wives feel a dulling of sensation, forming a chance of never experiencing pleasure. This is the main cause of some cases of anorgasmia.</p>
<p>Some say, "Women's libido is weaker than men's." This is superficial. In reality, women's libido is not weaker than men's. If compared, it may even be higher than men's. Moreover, women are easily emotional, easily seduced by the opposite sex, and prefer sensual pleasure. Therefore, it is natural that a husband with impotence and premature ejaculation is not welcomed by his wife.</p>
<p>I believe that no husband wants to make his wife suffer this kind of distress, so the best solution is to quickly replenish essence and tonify the kidneys to cultivate the prosperity of his youth glands, because the youth glands in the human body are important glands that dominate sexual desire, so strengthening the youth glands will eliminate the above-mentioned diseases. I am a specialist in venereal diseases, and I know that these diseases can only be completely cured by taking the German genuine testicular essence preparation "Butibon" for men, because the composition of "Butibon" includes brain-tonifying phosphorus in addition to testicular essence, so it is very effective for neurasthenia, insomnia, and forgetfulness. This is what I have long relied on in clinical practice, and I have never encountered a case where it was ineffective. As for women's lack of libido and anorgasmia, women must take "Butibon," because this agent has the function of regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy and is a holy medicine for gynecology.</p>
<h3>The Root Cause of Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Tuberculosis Expert Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Contracting tuberculosis is like putting on a dirty oilcloth, which is indeed a bit scary. Patients often do not pay attention to it because of its very slow progress. By the time the patient discovers that they have tuberculosis and wants to seek treatment, they are burdened by insufficient economic resources or do not know which medicine is most effective. In my experience with tuberculosis, the most effective medicine is "Pulmonal," a special medicine for tuberculosis invented by German Dr. Street. This medicine can enhance the lungs' resistance and directly kill the tuberculosis bacteria in the lungs. The resistance of tuberculosis bacteria is extremely strong. One can only increase one's own resistance to surround the tuberculosis bacteria and deprive them of the raw materials for survival, while increasing the defenses around them to completely eliminate the stubborn tuberculosis bacteria. Then, the terrible tuberculosis will be permanently cured. Most common tuberculosis medicines on the market do not understand the underlying cause, so they are mostly ineffective. "Pulmonal" targets the source of the disease, so it is effective.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>It is Appropriate to Nourish the Body in Summer</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Better Results Than in Winter</p>
<p>We often see many people with congenital weaknesses. When winter comes, they use ginseng, deer antler, sea dog kidney, and various other life-saving injections, choosing what suits their individual constitution. But when the hot summer comes, they do not use any nourishing medicines. This is a big mistake. Because our labor in summer is twice as much as in winter, and what is consumed is also twice as much as in other seasons. Taking sexual activity as an example, women in summer wear cicada-winged clothes, revealing their breasts and arms, and their bodies are graceful and sensuous. Therefore, it is easy to arouse our slight desire. All of these factors make supplementing the body in summer better than in winter. It can be said that supplementing the body in summer is even more important than in winter.</p>
<p>However, now that everyone understands the importance of supplementing the body in summer, another question arises: what kind of medicine is truly effective? Regarding this point, I can introduce you to what I have gained from years of experience.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the supplement itself, many winter tonics are too greasy. Because tonics are too greasy, they are unpleasant for the digestive function of the stomach. What's more, it is summer, when appetite is not good.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this problem has now been solved. Because German Dr. Mellon invented the youth gland preparation "Butibon," which can be said to be a very suitable summer tonic. It is not dry or greasy, and it can invigorate the spirit, promote appetite, and make people who work all day not feel a bit of boredom. It is absolutely guaranteed that people who easily feel insomnia in summer will not have insomnia if they take "Butibon." Because "Butibon" increases the health of the youth glands, making both appetite and sexual desire completely healthy.</p>
<h3>Causes of Weak Brain and Tinnitus</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>The conditions of tinnitus are varied. Some occur occasionally, some last for a long time, some are suddenly high and low, and some stop and start suddenly. Some people distinguish the causes of tinnitus according to its pitch, saying that low pitch is caused by disorders of the sound transmission device, and high pitch is caused by disorders of the sound perception device, but this statement is not very reliable.</p>
<p>The causes of tinnitus are very complex, but most are caused by imbalance after illness, congenital deficiencies, and acquired injuries. Those with nocturnal emission often suffer from this condition. Long-term nocturnal emission, like water in a field, flows out continuously, resulting in the crops losing their moisture and withering. Therefore, people with long-term nocturnal emission have dull complexions, are weak and tired, and have no heroic spirit. They should be treated quickly to prevent long-term damage.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, choosing effective medicines to strengthen the sperm gate is essential, but if one does not pay attention to health preservation or engages in masturbatory behavior, taking large amounts of medicine can be said to be still ineffective. At this time, the patient should have a clear mind and few desires, reject lewd thoughts, and administer neurasthenia therapy. It is absolutely necessary to take the testicular essence preparation "Butibon" for men three times a day, three tablets each time, and take three tablets of "Ners nocturnal emission tablets" before bed. Not only can nocturnal emission be completely cured, but also the weak brain and tinnitus caused by nocturnal emission are guaranteed to be cured in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<h3>Reasons for Wife's Displeasure</h3>
<p>— Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9</p>
<p>Most people who have contracted gonorrhea have gone to engage in promiscuous behavior because of sexual problems. This is already displeasing to those with wives. If they further transmit gonorrhea as a result, how can they explain themselves to the beauty in the house? Because the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea are diplococci, which have strong infectivity. If a married man has already contracted gonorrhea, he should first cure the gonorrhea before engaging in sexual intercourse from the perspective of humanity and love. However, most men, because they are husbands, urgently seek a quick cure and want to hide their suspicion from their wives, still engage in intercourse with their wives. They do not know that gonococci are the most easily transmitted bacteria. Since the husband's gonorrhea has not been cured, it will naturally be transmitted to the wife once they have sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>If a wife is unfortunately infected by her husband, a large amount of vaginal discharge will be produced, which is a great harm. The wife suffers this undeserved disaster for no reason, and her love for her husband will naturally be broken. The reason for this is that men with gonorrhea neglect their own viruses. However, it is not difficult to quickly resolve gonorrhea in its early stages. In my experience, taking the gonorrhea special medicine "Clinon," invented by Dr. Peter, is the most effective, because "Clinon" is based on non-specific therapy and is made with a mixture of protein and yellow pigment. After taking it, it causes all the cells of the patient to produce a kind of anti-gonorrhea toxin in a short period of time. Whether it is early or old white discharge, it can systematically eliminate it fundamentally. I also use German static electricity therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum for examination and use. It can be completely cured in three to five weeks. If the wife has also been infected, I prescribe her to use "Carr-Shute vaginal suppositories" for external use, and take "Clinon" internally and externally for treatment, and the effect is even faster. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Daily from today, 20 consultation numbers will be given out. Each number costs only 50 cents and comes with a free copy of "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases."</p>

<h3>The Origin of the Change in US Silver Policy</h3>
<p>— Chen Chengren</p>
<p>A concrete and steel-reinforced vault, which took more than two years to build and was only completed last autumn, is located on the grounds of a military academy in the western United States. It is equipped with the latest protection mechanisms. The vault is 252 feet long, 166 feet wide, and 22 feet high. There, half of the nation's silver, amounting to 35,000 tons of silver bars, was transported from New York City and stored in this heavily guarded vault. This sensational news is still vividly imprinted in the minds of people around the world. However, in less than a year, the US policy of raising silver prices has now been forced to change. Although not completely canceled, the purchase price for overseas silver has been steadily decreasing. It is said that this is a diplomatic tactic because the Mexican government wants to reclaim US oil mining rights in Mexico; the US is retaliating by devaluing overseas silver prices. It is also said that because Japan has plundered a considerable amount of silver in the Chinese war zone, the policy of maintaining silver prices is being abandoned to strike a blow against them. This explanation is not entirely far-fetched and has some factual basis. However, the fundamental reason for the US changing its silver price policy is that the silver price policy has never benefited the US in any way, and it has even incurred expenses for implementing the policy, such as the construction cost of the aforementioned vault. Apart from the US silver mine owners and the congressmen they employ, almost no one supports this unprofitable policy. The following is an essay against the silver price policy by a reporter from a New York City bank, published in the bank's monthly bulletin last autumn. It points out the changes in US silver policy from a longitudinal perspective and predicts the inevitable end of the policy. Reading it now, with the silver advocates in the US having lost power, it is easier to understand the inevitability of this change. (The units of quantity below are all in the British system.)</p>
<p>About a hundred years ago, the US began to pay attention to the silver problem. In the fifteen years from 1878 to 1893, a total of 459,949,000 taels of silver were purchased, worth $462,210,000. Later, due to a panic, President Cleveland convened Congress and resolved to stop the purchase, thus ending the silver problem. During the European War, due to the surge in Indian exports, there was a shortage of payment instruments. Therefore, the US sold silver coins to Britain. However, the silver advocates in Congress insisted on adopting Pittman's method, that is, the amount of silver sold must still be replenished in the future, and the purchase price was limited to more than one dollar per tael. Until 1933, when the world experienced an economic panic and there was a shortage of currency everywhere, the silver advocates began to demand that the government quickly purchase silver at a price of 1.29. They believed that if the silver price could be raised to $1.29 (according to the old coinage rate), it would definitely increase the purchasing power of China, establish a bimetallic system, and restore the prosperity of the world. Therefore, under the leadership of the US, a silver conference was held in London in 1933, and an agreement was established by eight countries to preserve or trade silver; the US had to purchase 24,412,410 taels (equal to its domestic production) starting from December 1933, at a value of 64.64 US cents per tael. The government charged 50% of the coinage rate (1.29) as "coinage tax" and 13% of the market price. In June 1934, the Silver Purchase Act was passed, requiring the purchase of silver until the amount in the national treasury was equal to 25% of the total monetary reserves, but the purchase price could not exceed the monetary value of silver (i.e., 1.29). This Silver Purchase Act was similar to the Silver Purchase Acts of 1878 and 1890, believing that the result of purchasing silver would definitely raise the market price of silver bars to be equal to the coinage rate and expand the monetary use of silver. In August of that year, the US president issued an order for nationalizing silver, requiring the government to collect all commercial silver at a fixed price, and the difference between the purchase price and 1.29 was considered the coinage fee. And immediately implemented purchases from abroad. Immediately, a batch of silver weighing 400 tons was transported from London to New York. This silver transaction created the highest record for silver crossing the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>During the economic panic at that time, silver also fell in price like other commodities. Silver averaged 58 US cents per tael in 1928, but fell to 27.8 cents in 1932. In 1933, due to the US dollar leaving the gold standard and the establishment of the eight-nation agreement, the silver price was maintained at an average price of 34.7 cents. In 1934, due to the efforts of the US government, it was raised to an average of 47.9 cents. In the second half of last year, influenced by the active purchases of the US Treasury and the target of 1.29, it soared madly for a while.</p>
<p>In fact, the soaring silver price was not beneficial to China, nor was it beneficial to Sino-US trade, contrary to their expectations. Because China has always adopted the silver standard, the rise in silver prices is the fall in the price of goods. For example, in 1932 and 1933, the fall in the price of Chinese products caused trade imbalances and silver outflows.</p>
<p>In October 1934, the Chinese government ordered a ban on silver exports, but due to the general rise in silver prices, silver was still smuggled out, and the amount was considerable. At that time, silver speculation was at its peak, raising prices above the US-set price. In April 1935, the London silver price reached 81 US cents. However, the US Treasury's purchase price for domestic silver was only 77.5 cents. In November of the same year, the Chinese government announced its abandonment of the silver standard and adopted a managed paper currency system. At the same time, the London silver market lost Washington's support and immediately showed signs of being top-heavy. Foreign silver fell from 81 cents to 43 cents. The US silver price initially remained at 77.5 cents, but was reduced to 64 and one-eighth cents in early 1938.</p>
<p>In May 1936, the Chinese government requested the cooperation of the US government to maintain a stable relationship between Chinese banknotes and US currency. At that time, an agreement was established in which the US government purchased a certain amount of Chinese silver (the amount was not announced) in exchange for US dollar credit or gold. And this agreement has been extended several times. Chinese silver was transferred from Hong Kong to London and then to New York. In the first half of 1938, 140,000,000 taels of Chinese silver coins were purchased, worth 63,000,000 US dollars. The Chinese silver purchased under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, according to informal estimates, totaled 300,000,000 taels.</p>
<p>This cash sale of Chinese silver coins started about two years before the Sino-Japanese War. Although the exact amount was not officially announced, it was probably used as bank deposits, except for the marked gold. China used this huge sum to pay for foreign expenses.</p>
<p>When the US first implemented the Silver Purchase Act in 1934, the Treasury had $7,856,000,000 in gold reserves. According to the new law, there should be $2,619,000,000 in silver. At a rate of 1.19 per tael, this would be 2,016,000,000 taels. At that time, there were 693,000,000 taels of silver (including subsidiary coins), so 1,333,000,000 taels of silver should be purchased. However, by the end of June 1938, gold reserves had reached $12,962,000,000. Even after purchasing 1,687,000,000 taels of silver at a cost of $900,000,000, there was still a shortage of 970,000,000 taels. This was naturally because as the current surplus increased, the silver that should be purchased also increased. The silver collected by the US Treasury came from various countries in addition to its own. However, foreign silver totaled 1,353,000,000 taels, while domestic silver was only 333,000,000 taels, of which newly mined silver accounted for 120,000,000 taels. The above situation is the influence of the US Silver Purchase Act on silver prices. In these four years, the amount of silver coins concentrated in the United States for melting exceeded the purchase of newly mined silver. It is estimated that every tael of domestically newly mined silver was purchased relative to 6.2 taels of foreign silver. Therefore, the effort to restore the worldwide bimetallic system was like doing a play with a stone mortar on one's head.</p>
<p>The result of the US silver purchase policy was not only this, but also the following situations occurred.</p>
<p>(1) The hope of restoring the bimetallic system has since disappeared. When the US government was clearly behind the scenes, speculators were very enthusiastic. Once the US government showed a slight retreat, speculators immediately stopped buying. Furthermore, when the London Silver Agreement expired at the end of 1937, none of the other seven countries proposed to extend it. Therefore, the silver originally purchased by other countries was also dumped to the US.</p>
<p>(2) China, the only country using silver coins and purchasing 100 million taels of silver every year, had to abandon silver and adopt a managed paper currency system, and instead sell the silver accumulated over the dynasties on the world market.</p>
<p>(3) The US tried its best to raise silver prices and completely absorbed all the silver in the world. However, the maintenance of silver prices depended entirely on the US continuing to purchase. Once the purchase was weak, the silver price fell from 81 cents to 43 cents. In fact, this price of 43 cents was still maintained because the US came out to buy.</p>
<p>(4) In the July 1, 1938, Treasury report, the "coinage tax" income of $446,088,793 in the general fund and the amount of silver bars purchased under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 did not increase. However, under the asset items, there were 870,940,306 taels of silver, valued at $479,600,198, calculated at an average price of 55 cents per tael. This number appeared for the first time as silver that did not receive "coinage tax," which is worth discussing.</p>
<p>It was found that in the first half of the year before last, the US government purchased $100 million worth of imported gold and specially tried to eliminate its activity, so that it would not invade the monetary system. This clearly showed that silver was not needed in the US monetary reserves.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reporter of the magazine concluded: "During the period when the Silver Purchase Act continued to be effective, US silver production increased from 24,000,000 taels in 1932 to 69,000,000 taels in 1937. The silver production of other countries was three to four times that of the US, and most of it was sold to the US government. In the first half of last year, the US silver import totaled 260,000,000 taels, valued at $112,000,000. What benefit does this investment bring to the American people? Furthermore, since the US silver purchase movement began, the US has never had the opportunity to resell. Every time the US wants to find a way to sell silver, it will cause widespread panic and the collapse of world silver prices, and it is still like this now. Just the administrative expenses spent by the US Treasury to purchase silver amounted to $287,000 in 1937."</p>
<p>Finally, he quoted President Cleveland's reasons for advocating the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act of 1890 in Congress in 1893, criticizing the mistakes of the recent silver price policy. He said: "The American people should have a sound and stable monetary system and should be recognized by various exchanges and markets. The government has no right to conduct financial experiments that violate the policies and habits of other civilized countries, thereby harming the interests of the people. The country also has no position to use our material wealth to harm the soundness of the people's currency." At the US Congress earlier this year, the silver opponents powerfully used this criticism again. It can be seen that this change in the US silver policy is clearly not just a diplomatic tactic. The abandonment of the US silver policy is indeed inevitable; but in terms of steps, it still has to be fully cautious. On the one hand, it still maintains the purchase price of domestic production at a higher level, and on the other hand, it slowly lowers the purchase price of overseas silver. This is out of fear that the silver price will plummet!</p>
<h3>A Review of Shanghai's Economy in the Past Six Months (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an</p>
<p>The Commodity Market in the Past Six Months</p>
<p>Looking back at the Shanghai commodity market in the past six months, it clearly showed a major crisis, that is, a certain party has already started its monopoly and manipulation methods. Merchants were unaware and did not conspire to unite to resist, but only competed for private interests. Finally, they allowed the monopoly to succeed, and the prices of various goods rose irrationally.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are nothing more than that within the Shanghai concession area, there are only some light industry and agricultural processing industry production facilities. The processing industry production in the occupied area has long been operated by a certain party. The total production volume is far greater than that in the concession area. Therefore, it itself has monopoly power in the supply market. Moreover, all agricultural products and raw materials are not produced in the concession area and are entirely dependent on imports from the mainland and overseas. A certain party used military force to control the distribution of products in the occupied area, and also used its control over transportation agencies and transportation lines in various places. Therefore, the transportation of products from the occupied area to Shanghai was subject to the will of a certain party. Whether it was extortion along the way, interception for their own use, or absolute prohibition of transportation to Shanghai, they had to be purchased from them. Therefore, the supply of the Shanghai commodity market increased and decreased from time to time. The transportation costs to Shanghai also rose steadily. If the Shanghai commodity market had restraint and no room for free contraction, and also adopted a joint purchase policy to confront, it could still curb the arbitrary demands and exactions of a certain party. However, people in various industries were ignorant of this principle and did not try to do this, but only competed to purchase and hoard in order to profit from the scarcity. Therefore, they entered their trap. In the past six months, cotton yarn rose sharply first, followed by soybean oil, then silk and rayon soared, and finally the rice market, which was subject to price limits. Wherever the evil hand reached, the prices rose to unprecedented levels. Commentators often mistakenly believe that they were indirectly affected by foreign exchange, but in fact, the manipulation of the evil hand was far greater than the impact of exchange rates.</p>
<p>The Price Increase of Shanghai Commodities in the Past Six Months (Unit: National Currency Yuan)</p>
<p>(Note) The standard products selected for the above commodities are: (1) Yarn (Double Horse Brand, 20 count); (2) Cotton (Fire Machine Cotton); (3) Rice (various grades of white japonica); (4) Flour (Green Ship No. 2); (5) Soybeans (Dalian round soybeans); (6) Soybean Oil (Dalian Oil); (7) Bean Cake (Dalian Cake); Silk (80 points or more, 20/22 denier). Except for June, which is the highest and lowest price of the entire month, the rest are the monthly averages. However, silk is the average of the middle of each month:</p>
<p>As for imported goods, with the decline in exchange rates, they also increased in the opposite direction. This degree of increase is roughly equal to the rate of decline in exchange rates. From the perspective of the entire national economy, the high prices of imported goods have the effect of naturally suppressing imports; however, it must be conditional on being able to self-supply or substitute. The people's strict frugality can indeed make up for the difficulties when the above conditions are insufficient. However, frugality has a certain limit. Otherwise, on the other hand, the increase in the people's hardship is also enough to weaken the vitality of the social economy. However, among China's imported goods, except for a few absolutely necessary items, the rest are non-urgent or unnecessary items or items that can be replaced domestically. Unfortunately, the people take pride in Europeanization, resulting in the main source of imports. Today, although the Ministry of Finance has implemented a policy of prohibiting imports, its legal power is difficult to enter Shanghai. I am afraid that the ability to suppress imports still cannot rely on foreign exchange policy?</p>
<p>The Latent and Deteriorating Crisis</p>
<p>Shanghai has a concentrated population and limited job supply. With prices so high, it is obviously enough to threaten the prosperity of the entire social economy. In the past, those that could rise were still imported goods and essential daily necessities. Therefore, the general public could still survive by frugality as much as possible. Judging from the Shanghai Worker's Cost of Living Index compiled by the China Statistics Society, the cost of living in the first half of the two years of this year and last year has increased significantly compared with before. As listed below:</p>
<p>However, since May, food costs have risen sharply. This item of consumption is very limited. In addition to cutting other consumption expenses to maintain food for the people, there is no other way. Yes: Only to increase their income. If so: Then the general price will increase again; otherwise, the general market will also shrink due to the decline in the purchasing power of the public, which is beyond doubt. This is one of the crises latent in Shanghai's economy.</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai is indeed in the so-called "wartime boom" period. The reasons for this are: First, the increase in population; Second, the war is far away from Shanghai, and it has gradually restored its position as a collection and distribution center geographically; Third, small-scale production in the concession area has developed as the market needs; Fourth, the destruction of production facilities and the decline in production in the suburbs; Fifth, the abundance of floating capital, the prosperity of speculation, the increase in unearned income and the indulgence in consumption; Sixth, the decline in exchange rates and the rise in prices have stimulated the operation of general commerce. However, the main reasons are still the dramatic increase in population and the maintenance of internal transportation relations. Unfortunately, these two major conditions have now changed. Has the population of Shanghai not decreased? But its increase has already stopped. Therefore, the market demand of the wood market has been invisibly limited. In addition, prices rise beyond purchasing power, which is reducing the degree of market demand. This is one of them. Recently, the Japanese army's strategy of blockading the sea routes in various parts of China is becoming more intense and being implemented. Once the door for domestic sales is cut off, the Shanghai market will inevitably fall into a state of exhaustion. This is the second. The transportation of products from the occupied area to Shanghai has been monopolized by a certain party, and the production facilities in the occupied area have been revived in the hands of the Japanese one after another. All of this is enough to greatly hit the production in the Shanghai concession area and increase the trade deficit in the concession area. This is the third. Any one of these blows is enough to restrain Shanghai's economy and prevent it from continuing to thrive. Moreover, three aspects have occurred at the same time, and the people's livelihood is uneasy due to the soaring price of grain. Therefore, Shanghai's "boom" today is feared to be on the verge of the most critical juncture.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industry Before and After the War (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Here are the losses suffered by the entire Shanghai industry during the war, based on reports from various trade associations: "(1) Textile factories, 30 run by Chinese businessmen, of which 7 factories have been working throughout, and the remaining 23 have suffered losses of varying degrees. (2) Dyehouses, a total of 19 of all sizes, were destroyed during the war. (3) Knitting factories, a total of 50, of which 15 were destroyed. (4) Silk reeling factories, almost all of them were destroyed except for the 4 within the defense line. (5) Silk weaving factories, with hundreds, of which 300 were destroyed. (6) Chemical plants, 9 large-scale factories were destroyed. (7) Soap factories, 6 large-scale factories were completely destroyed. (8) Paper mills, only 4 were operating, 5 were completely destroyed, and 15 suffered major damage of varying degrees. (9) Printing factories, the 2 largest were severely damaged, and a total of 200 small-scale printing factories were destroyed. (10) Tobacco factories, a total of 18, of which 8 were completely destroyed. (11) Flour mills, a total of 15, of which 8 were destroyed. (12) Lumber mills, a total of 22, were either destroyed or severely damaged. (13) Machine factories, there were large-scale shipyards, machine factories, ordnance factories, printing machine factories, and scientific instrument factories, all of which suffered extremely heavy damage; hundreds of small-scale factories were completely destroyed. (14) Rubber factories, a total of 35, of which only 6 were able to resume operation. (15) Glass factories, a total of 26, half of which were destroyed. In addition, there were several daily necessities manufacturing factories, including companies manufacturing canned goods, educational supplies, hemp rope and its goods, all of which were also destroyed." (See the "Great British Night Post" published on May 1). The estimated losses range from 450 million yuan to 800 million to 4 billion yuan. But the exact figures cannot be determined even now. However, no one would deny that the losses suffered by Shanghai's industry after the war were not significant.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's industry suffered significant destruction and losses after the war, it soon gradually showed a lively posture and emerged. And in the second half of last year, there was even rapid progress.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial Spot Black Market Not Heard of Opening, Price Similar to Saturday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local spot black market was closed due to the Sunday holiday. The price of outside trades has not been called. It is heard that the retail price of the money exchange industry is similar to the closing price of last Saturday, around 2,620 yuan, with little fluctuation.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael has of course not changed. Da Tong Hang quoted 265 yuan, Xin Tong Hang quoted 263 yuan, and the purchase price was 257 yuan. Only Heng Fu offered a high price of 266 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Quiet</h3>
<p>London, 15th: English pure gold has not changed, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silver Prices Quiet</h3>
<p>London, 15th: The large silver market, both near and far futures have not changed. India and speculators both traded in and out differently, the market situation is stable. Also, New York reported that US silver spot prices are still stable. Bombay reported that Indian silver spot prices and July futures both increased by one anna, August increased by two annas, and the market situation is stable. A total of 120 transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs Saigon Rice Arrives, 700 Tons</h3>
<p>The local national rice price soared, and foreign rice took the chance to revive its business. General foreign rice merchants have been placing orders from Vietnam and Siam. However, recently the foreign exchange application has been strict, which is extremely inconvenient. But with the excuse of people's food, it can still be managed. It is now heard that Da Fu Foreign Company's first batch of 700 tons of foreign indica rice, namely 7,000 bags, has been shipped, loaded on the Italian postal ship company's Cortellazzo, which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, Monday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Local Factory Ice Drops Half Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat and soft, continuing to decline. The association's trading price for spot goods was 24 yuan and a few jiao for coarse white. The local company's price was 29 yuan and 1 jiao, the foreign company's price was 29 yuan, and the transferrable goods were 20 yuan and 8 jiao for a few jiao. Tai Koo's Car White B Mark maintained its original price, decreasing by a few jiao in order. CW Mark was 30 yuan and 1 jiao, CX Mark was 29 yuan and 8 jiao, DY Mark was 29 yuan and a half, HX Mark was 29 yuan and 3 jiao. Spot Dutch red decreased by a few jiao to 22 yuan and 2 jiao. The local factory ice dropped by half a yuan. No. 1 Ice was 34 yuan and a half, and Jing Ming Ice was 36 yuan. As the price of national sugar has been rising recently, although the goods are scarce, sales are also low, so the company's intention to import has gradually faded. Except for a few scattered transactions, there is a lack of wholesale transactions. The future market is guarded against loosening.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Dalian Soybeans Recover 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The lowest price of Dalian soybeans in the previous market had fallen to 21 yuan and a few yuan. But recently, the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs suddenly became active, handling a total of five or six truckloads, a total of 1,500 to 1,600 bags, so the market price rose by about two yuan. Yesterday's market price was 24 yuan and a half. It is heard that the new season of Xu Kui soybeans is approaching in the production area, and the large ones may be shipped to Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Coal Firewood Arrived in Short Supply</h3>
<p>The firewood market, recently due to the ever-changing situation in eastern Zhejiang, the arrival of sailboats is intermittent, and the local market's outbound routes, due to Tianjin and Gulangyu having handled large quantities a month ago, have led to a shortage of spot goods, and the market situation continues to be strong. The industry's split prices are as follows: large anti-white firewood is 6 bundles per yuan, small anti-white firewood is 22 bundles, firewood is 14 bundles, and firewood is 20 bundles. Dock transfer and delivery require additional cartage fees.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Iron Tiles Sell Well, Market Considered Active</h3>
<p>The white iron tile sales market primarily targets the local construction trade, while sales to other trades are also considered active. Recently, due to vigorous purchases by the Tianjin trade and subsequent competition from local construction groups, the white iron tile market is quite lively, with standard prices rising sharply. Currently, 6-foot sheets sell for 2 yuan 5 jiao and 7-foot sheets sell for 3 yuan, both increases compared to previous prices. Other construction materials, such as 3-4 fen bamboo-joint steel bars, are priced at 370 yuan per ton, while 5 fen to coarse patterns sell for 340 yuan per ton. 6-foot plain white iron sheets sell for 2 yuan 4 jiao each, and 7-foot sheets sell for 2 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen. New disc ingots sell for 18 yuan per dan (unit of weight), binding wire sells for 16 yuan 5 jiao per dan, and original capital nails are priced around 20 yuan per barrel, all showing a slight upward trend compared to previous prices.</p>

<h3>British Admiral Visits the King of Siam</h3>
<p>The British Naval Admiral, aboard the warship Erlunzhu, sailed to Luo Luobin Cape, also known as Bangkok, the capital of Siam, built along the Chao Phraya River. Due to shallow waters at the sea entrance, the warship could not enter, so two small steamers carried the Admiral and his accompanying officers. Along the way, they saw dense fields of crops and flourishing sugarcane, with a vast expanse of green between the fields, and the breeze brought coolness to their robes. The ship docked at the British Consulate, a building originally facing the sea. The weather that day was scorching, with the thermometer rising to 90 degrees. The British Consul informed the Siamese high officials of the Admiral's desire to meet the King. Despite the oppressive heat, full military dress was required for the audience. There were two Kings in Siam: the Great King and the Second King. The Admiral first paid respects to the Great King, who sat on a couch, leaning on a jade table, with the Second King seated beside him. The Consul led the Admiral forward, and after the formalities, the Great King invited them to a side hall, lavishly decorated. The King sat, with the Consul and Admiral seated to his left and right. The King was in his prime, only twenty-one years old. The Second King wore a military uniform with a sword, resembling a British cavalry officer, and his duty was to command the royal guards. An elderly minister wore diamonds as buttons on his robe. The palace floor was covered with mica, and the windows were draped with silk brocade, with dazzling colors. After the conversation, they went out to listen to drum music, the melody was melodious and rhythmic, as the Admiral had brought his own band to perform. The Admiral then returned to his ship, removing his military dress, feeling as if he had escaped from a fiery pit. The next day, he also visited the Second King, whose palace was slightly less luxurious, but still grand and spacious. Three days later, the Second King, accompanied by an old minister, returned the visit on the warship, ordering the raising of the mast and firing of cannons as a respectful welcome. The conversation was extremely cordial. The Second King closely examined the ship's equipment, expressing great admiration, and presented the Admiral with gold medals and other gifts, showing exceptional courtesy and humility, as if forgetting his royal status.</p>

<h3>Original Suitability</h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>Born into this world, people have to adapt to the environment, or there will be a danger of "falling behind" and "degenerating." Therefore, if people want to seek progress and conform to the trends of the times, they must adapt to the surrounding environment one by one. It would be even better if they could intensify this and be "overly sensitive," because preventing problems before they happen, refusing to eat because of choking, and refusing to drink because of sputtering, until not eating or drinking, "dying only after," or even being like the man of Qi fearing the sky and everyone hanging themselves, is the best strategy for adapting.</p>
<p>Reading the same ancient books, the way ancient people read them is completely different from the way modern people read them. Ancient people read books thinking that a great man should be "rich and not licentious, poor and not moved, and mighty and not bent"; they also thought that a great man "once speaks, four horses cannot catch up." Modern people only memorize the sentence "A great man can bend and stretch," and even suspect that the previous two sentences were forged by later generations and can be ignored. This is because modern people are good at adapting. Therefore, under the immortal theorem of "the National Army retreating west in a different environment," strange things are endless. If someone had nothing to do and wrote a modern Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, it would be a good business. To give a small example, attending entertainment events on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death to show superiority is bending; when meeting people, saying that when the war of resistance is won in the future, they will kowtow three times more in front of Sun Yat-sen's portrait is stretching. Modern youth dancing, skating, and swimming, when questioned, say that the environment is like this, which is bending; they also say that dancing can practice hand-to-hand combat, and swimming and skating can practice water warfare, and even when charging in the frozen areas of the north, they can put on ice skates and slide down, speeding like the wind and splitting bamboo, which is stretching. Being able to bend and stretch is truly worthy of being a "great man"! Small things are like this, and big things can be imagined, so I won't say more. There are so many great men like this, excuse me! Excuse me!</p>
<p>However, if a great man can bend and stretch, he is still worthy of being a great man. The most unfortunate people in the world are those great men who can bend but cannot stretch! When times are good, they simply don't know how to stretch; when times are bad, they bend again and again, gritting their teeth and "bending bitterly"; when an opportunity comes, they even advise others to learn to "bend" like them. They can be said to adapt to the environment to the fullest extent; they can also be said to bend to the fullest extent. Therefore, they can be called "Bending Great Men," which is almost the same name as the former "Qu Yuan." In fact, their bending until death is indeed much better than Qu Yuan's throwing himself into the river; the reason is that they are good at adapting, so no wonder Darwin sighed: "Alas, the fittest survive!"</p>
<p>Opening the dictionary, I just thought that the word "fit" can also be interpreted as "marry." From "marry," I inadvertently thought of the phrase "marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog." I have not read the Explaining Words and Analyzing Characters, but I think the reason why "fit" can be interpreted as marrying is because of this idiom. A person who wants to adapt to the environment has to hold a bowl of rice, marry a chicken and follow the chicken, marry a dog and follow the dog. After marrying, everything said before can be declared invalid and can be regarded as farting. The first item under "fit" in the National Pronunciation Dictionary says: "To go, also a woman's marriage is called fitting a man," which shows that "fit," "marry," and "go" have the same meaning. Therefore, we can also say: "Go chicken, follow chicken; go dog, follow dog." "Go dog" naturally means "go to the dog's place." Dogs bark and bite at those who are dressed in rags, and welcome and fawn on those who are dressed in gorgeous clothes, which shows that "going to the dog" is not easy.</p>
<p>Postscript: The author's knowledge is shallow, and omissions are unavoidable, but I do not hope that scholars at home and abroad will not hesitate to teach me, because even a slight statement will lose the way of "fitting."</p>
<h3>Chop It Down Day After Day</h3>
<h3>On the Road to Danyang</h3>
<p>— Le Huan</p>
<p>——A Battlefield Account from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line——</p>
<p>It was November, and snow was just starting to fall, with wind blowing. The countryside revealed a desolate scene. Our small team, facing the wind and snow, began our journey towards Danyang.</p>
<p>All along, relying on the towering telegraph poles along the railway as our guide, we trod on the slippery muddy path, crossing streams and villages. Along the way, each of us silently calculated how much distance we had slipped under our feet. Sparse sounds of chickens crowing and dogs barking occasionally drifted from the villages, further emphasizing the tranquility of the land.</p>
<p>The wind grew stronger, and although we wore cotton clothes, they were as thin as autumn clothes. Even vigorous running couldn't resist the cold. Our limbs were numb, and our bodies were shivering. The wind blew head-on, reducing our speed to about seven miles per hour.</p>
<p>Step by step, we kept our mouths shut. The force of the wind often blocked our breathing through our noses. Each comrade bent over, as if covering during a charge, or more like a boat tracker by the river.</p>
<p>After crossing a stone bridge and passing several small trees, we arrived at a small village ahead. It was time for a rest, and we had completed two-thirds of the journey.</p>
<p>All the strong men in the village had gone to defend the area, leaving only a few women and young children. We entered a house near the entrance of the village. An old woman, around sixty years old, was leaning against the door, watching. Two innocent children stood beside her.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, old lady, do you have anything you can sell us to fill our stomachs?" the secretary asked in his Hunan dialect, shaking off the snowflakes.</p>
<p>"Oh..." The old woman rolled her eyes, not understanding the secretary's words. This was when we needed to act as temporary translators.</p>
<p>"There's nothing good in the countryside. We have rice, but no vegetables!" The old woman took a liking to our local dialect and wore a kind smile on her wrinkled face.</p>
<p>"We don't need rice. It's too much trouble. It would be best if there was something ready-made because we still need to travel!" Si Zheng very gently asked the old woman to think of a solution. In fact, what was left in our stomachs was still from last night!</p>
<p>"Then let me look around..." The old woman began to rummage, and the children helped her search.</p>
<p>"Sweet potato...!" A child held up a very large one.</p>
<p>"Sweet potato?" I jumped up with joy. I had loved it for a long time, even when I was in my hometown three or four years ago. Since entering the circle of life, I hadn't tasted it for three or four years. I didn't expect to taste it again at this time and place.</p>
<p>The old woman was stunned by my loud exclamation.</p>
<p>"Just sweet potato then. It's a very delicious thing. Thank you, old lady!"</p>
<p>"Delicious? How can there be anything good in the countryside? If you don't mind, I'll cook it for you!"</p>
<p>"Good! Let's do that." The secretary also expressed his happiness.</p>
<p>Although the old woman was so old, her movements were quick and strong. She broke off the reeds one by one and sent them into the stove, which burned brightly. The house gradually warmed up, and our numb limbs slowly recovered.</p>
<p>She stared at the flames for a long time, putting more reeds in, and said to us, looking back, "You must be very tired!" The firelight flickered on the old woman's face, making it very rosy.</p>
<p>"No, old lady, you're the one who's tired!"</p>
<p>"Alas! I'm old and useless! I'm only fit to sit at home and wait to die... Alas, how's the situation these days? It shouldn't be too bad, right!"</p>
<p>"Here? It's safe for now." Two streams of thought rose in my heart.</p>
<p>The water boiled, and the old woman didn't ask any more questions. She stood up, lifted the lid of the pot, and used chopsticks to pick up the sweet potatoes, saying happily, "It's almost ready!"</p>
<h3>Mourning Gongsun Min</h3>
<p>— Wang Fen</p>
<p>—A Fighter in the Theater World</p>
<p>I was shocked when I accidentally saw the news of Gongsun Min's death in the newspaper. Could it be him, Gongsun Min, who appeared on the stage with the demeanor of a warrior, who died in Shanghai? The newspaper's account was vague, only saying that he had a relapse of typhoid fever, the treatment was ineffective, and he died in ×× hospital. It didn't mention a single word about his accomplishments, his career, his background, or his family situation. I suspected that it was another person who happened to have the same name and surname as him, who died in the hospital from illness. However, I also intuitively felt that this suspicion was unnecessary, and I intuitively affirmed that it must be him! There are probably not many friends in Shanghai who know Gongsun Min, perhaps very few of my friends know Gongsun Min, so apart from a piece of news in the newspaper, I haven't heard anyone talk about it. Sometimes when I ask people, they don't even know about the record in the newspaper. A fighter in the theater world, dying so lonely, is really a most lamentable thing. I don't know if the comrades in the Shanghai theater world know this fighter? Do they know the sad news of this fighter? If there are also people who know him, I believe they should mourn him well.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Gongsun Min was a year ago. At that time, I was in Guilin, Guangxi. Every Sunday, I often went to Yu Tang Fengzi's house to chat. Because Fengzi loved drama, I could often meet many writers and actors at her house. One time, we were chatting with Ouyang Yuqian when suddenly a friend wearing a black shirt came, acting quickly and looking excited. Fengzi vaguely introduced him to me, knowing that he was an actor in the National Defense Art Society of the Fifth Route Army Headquarters, and was rehearsing Yang Hansheng's "The Eve" and Ouyang Yuqian's "In the Green Yarn Tent." Both of these scripts had Fengzi's involvement, and even Yu Tang participated in the performance of "The Eve." Probably that afternoon, they were preparing to rehearse, so I said goodbye and came out first. A week later, I went to Fengzi's house as usual, and saw a guest who was already at her house. I couldn't remember who he was for a moment, but he greeted me. This time, I knew that his name was Gongsun Min. And this time, he gave me a deep impression: he had the enthusiasm of youth, and the dignity of old age, the sensitivity of a poet, and the soul of a playwright. He had thoughts, achievements, and backbone! I felt that an actor like him should not be regarded as just an actor!</p>
<p>After that, I saw him two or three more times. But these two or three times were completely different. It was on the stage, appearing with the demeanor of a warrior. After listening to his lines and watching his performance, I was deeply moved, and I believe I was definitely not the only one who was moved. I simply forgot that I was watching a play, and I also forgot that he was acting. I thought that all the actions and all the words were what every Chinese person with flesh and blood should express and proclaim. I felt that Gongsun Min was the character in the play, and the character in the play was the personification of Gongsun Min's personality. In art, he was successful; and in personality, I had a better understanding of him. However, because I was always busy with trivial matters, I had no opportunity to see him again after that. When I left Guangxi, I became even more distant from him.</p>
<p>More than two months ago, a friend suddenly came to find me. Unexpectedly, it was Gongsun Min who had come all the way from Guangxi to Shanghai. He still had that enthusiastic and dignified appearance, narrating the experience of leaving Guilin in a torrent of words. He asked me about the situation in the Shanghai theater world, and I was ashamed that I had nothing to say. I asked him how he would live in the future, and he seemed still prepared to engage in literary and theatrical work. He told me that he lived on ×× Road, and he also copied down my phone number, preparing to talk again later. Who knew that this farewell would become eternal? I myself was busy all day long and had no time to visit any friends. And he, I don't know why, never came to visit me. When I saw the record in the newspaper, I learned that he had been ill for a month, and after a month, he died of a relapse of typhoid fever! Such a fighter in the theater world, not dying in artillery fire, not dying in bombing, but dying from an incurable disease, was really too wronged!</p>
<p>When writing this short article, I kept looking at Gongsun Min's stills published in the 140th issue of Liangyou, which were from the performance in Guilin. However, the person is gone, and the image remains, only increasing my grief!</p>
<h3>Red Devil Vasika</h3>
<p>— By Maxim Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>Although they spoke in low voices, their momentum was fierce. They surrounded Vasika's bed, looking at his gray face with fierce but gleeful eyes; he also looked at them. In his eyes, there was no longer that insatiable greed—that inexplicable greed that was always shining in his eyes.</p>
<p>"You... see clearly... I will get better..."</p>
<p>"That's God's will, you won't get better..." Rita interrupted him.</p>
<p>Vasika closed his mouth tightly without saying a word.</p>
<p>"Does that leg hurt?" One of them leaned down and asked kindly, her face turning green, her teeth grinding, "Ah, is it this side?"</p>
<p>As she spoke, she grabbed Vasika's injured leg and pulled it hard towards her.</p>
<p>Vasika bit his teeth and groaned. His left hand was also broken. He waved his right hand to hit her, but hit his own stomach instead.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter erupted around him.</p>
<p>"Stinky thing!" He opened his eyes in fear and shouted, "You be careful! I will kill you in the future..."</p>
<p>But they jumped back and forth around his bed, pulling his hair, spitting on his face, and dragging his sore feet. Their eyes were on fire. They laughed, cursed, and cried like dogs. Their curses were all in vulgar and unbearable language. They were so caught up in revenge that they became enraged. They took off their clothes and became a group of snow-white figures, which was very frightening.</p>
<p>Vasika shook his right hand and roared. The madam stood at the door and shouted in a rude voice:</p>
<p>"Enough... If you touch him again, I will call the police! You will kill him... God! God..."</p>
<p>But they didn't hear her. He had abused them for several years—they were just repaying him for a moment, so they were all angry and unwilling to give up...</p>
<p>Suddenly, in this clamor and groaning "enjoyment", a rude, reprimanding voice arose:</p>
<p>"You... enough already... Please have a little pity... He is also... suffering the same... Aren't you? Good-hearted people, for Jesus's sake... good-hearted..." These words seemed like a basin of cold water poured on the prostitutes, and had an effect? They were surprised and quickly ran away.</p>
<p>The one who spoke was A Qusniya. She stood by the window, shaking all over, holding her belly with both hands, comically stretching her body forward, and bowing deeply to them.</p>
<p>Vasika had fallen asleep. The shirt on his chest was torn, and his broad chest, covered with dense red hair, was beating quickly—as if agitated by a torrent.</p>
<p>Gurgling sounds came from his throat. His eyes were closed. (Nine)</p>
<h3>Joy (1)</h3>
<p>Joyful people are rarely seen in society, and it can be said that they are never seen. Because what is seen in society is bitterness, resentment, jealousy, strife, grievances, slander, hatred, murder, and tragic scenes, where can there be joyful people?</p>
<p>Some people say that Shanghai society is a joyful society. Movie theaters, dance halls, Pingju operas, variety shows, drum lyrics, casinos, opium dens, and emerging clubs are all crowded with people. Aren't they all happy, jumping, crowded, joyful people? I say, alas! This is a reaction to depression, where is there joy? The people inside are muddled and cannot talk about joy or sorrow. If there are rational people, they are all shrouded in clouds of sorrow, as if entering human hell. Once they fall, they are unable to extricate themselves. It's really wanting to cry but having no tears, so where can they get joy?</p>
<p>The joy I am talking about not only does not include this kind of inferior entertainment, but also does not include the highest level of material enjoyment and the most transcendent cultivation of sentiment. These two kinds of people may occasionally have a taste of shallow joy, but it is not the true and great joy, so it cannot be regarded as joy. The joy I am talking about is the most real joy. The environment changes in myriad ways, but joy does not change. Human affairs are impermanent, but joy is constant. Its joy comes from the depths of the soul, and others cannot suppress it, and oneself cannot stop it. It is full of vitality and naturally revealed, so that people who are close to it can feel the sweetness and the joy of broad daylight. Only those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus are like this. This kind of great joy can be experienced by everyone, but it cannot be described in writing even in the slightest. Shanghai Christian Literature Publishing Society, P.O. Box 1227.</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the Legal Validity of Transfer Drafts for Settlement</h3>
<p>— Ding Yuchang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Yu Yonghua's article, "Following My Article on the Ministry of Finance's Telegraphic Transfer Restriction Measures," which stated, "Solely from a legal perspective, the previous financial stabilization measures were implemented effectively in the interior for a long time without hindrance. Why have they gradually lost their effectiveness in Shanghai, requiring the Ministry of Finance's recent telegraphic transfers for supplementary restrictions? This can only be attributed to the Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Association's publicly set exchange rates for drafts and the court's rulings that transfer drafts do not have legal tender status, leading to this situation." This expresses deep regret that the Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Association and the courts have failed to deeply understand and earnestly implement the national policy of stabilizing finance. Criticizing the virtuous is a classic principle, and its argument is quite appropriate. However, Shanghai's environment is unique, and the government often faces obstacles when implementing national policies during wartime, not just in the matter of drafts. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that our country's legal rights in Shanghai have not been fully maintained.</p>
<p>Since our country implemented the legal tender (fapi) policy, the legal tender has been the sole currency, as confirmed by law and in fact. Following the "August 13th Incident," the government implemented "Financial Stabilization Measures" to restrict withdrawals and deposits. In Shanghai, transfer drafts were universally used by banks and money shops, serving to prevent capital flight and reduce the circulation of legal tender, preventing it from being exploited by the Japanese puppet regime to obtain foreign exchange. Transfer drafts originally took the form of negotiable instruments but served as a supplementary currency to the legal tender. Banks and money shops used them to pay legal tender deposits, and according to the law, they had the same settlement validity as legal tender, without any distinction. The fact that they could not be exchanged for legal tender, like general negotiable instruments, was confirmed by government decrees, which also served to prevent capital flight and reduce the circulation of legal tender. However, as the war prolonged, the twenty-week period had long passed, and even the 5% weekly withdrawal limit could be fully exhausted. Furthermore, since March of last year, the government implemented foreign exchange controls and promulgated the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations." Legally, the buying and selling of foreign exchange should be centralized at the Central Bank. "Foreign exchange that the state refuses to supply, sought instead in the black market, cannot be considered normal." However, due to the existence of the concession system and the presence of numerous foreign banks, capital flight had an easy path to follow. Coupled with the westward shift of the war, Shanghai's position as China's financial center remained unshaken. Therefore, foreign trade in the interior relied on Shanghai as the final clearing location. A surge in imports became a common phenomenon in China's international trade, and it is undeniable that the government could not satisfy the Shanghai foreign exchange market, both in terms of national policy and in practice. This led to the emergence of a foreign exchange black market. In this illegal foreign exchange black market, legal tender could be used to freely buy foreign exchange outside the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations." However, transfer drafts could not be exchanged for foreign exchange in the black market; they had to be converted into legal tender first. Consequently, the settlement validity of transfer drafts inevitably became unstable, which is the main reason for the discount on transfer drafts. If there were no foreign exchange black market, and legal tender could not be used to obtain foreign exchange without applying to the Central Bank according to the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations," then why would holders of transfer drafts accept a discount to exchange them for legal tender? Why would various industries hold discriminatory views towards transfer drafts? And why would the maintenance of the same settlement validity between transfer drafts and legal tender become a problem? But does the government have the power to eliminate the foreign exchange black market? No one can answer this question with certainty. Therefore, the denial of the same settlement validity between transfer drafts and legal tender, while formally a court judgment, is essentially due to the illegal foreign exchange black market. Since the foreign exchange black market cannot be legally suppressed, even if the court rules to maintain the settlement validity of transfer drafts, it would only create further disputes. Ultimately, it would merely transform a legal issue into a diplomatic one.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association announced the exchange rates for transfer drafts at the time under the entrustment of national banks and to safeguard general legitimate commerce. When the discount on transfer drafts continued to rise sharply, speculation and manipulation became deeply entrenched. If national banks did not authorize the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association to stabilize the discount rate on transfer drafts, the disparity between transfer drafts and legal tender would widen even further, further benefiting speculators. Although the government has put great effort into stabilizing Shanghai's finances, the special environment and incomplete legal rights have hindered its measures. For example, since the "Financial Stabilization Measures" after the "August 13th Incident" confirmed that transfer drafts could be used to pay legal tender deposits, their settlement validity should be maintained before this law becomes invalid. Why, according to recent reports, did the four national banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank—only allow 95% of the 22 million yuan in transfer deposits from banks and money shops to be exchanged for legal tender starting from July 4th? This means that transfer drafts do not have the same settlement validity as legal tender, not only as judged by the courts but also as confirmed by the government. With such contradictory measures from the government, how can the settlement validity of transfer drafts be maintained?</p>
<p>In conclusion, Shanghai's environment is unique, and the financial industry has a strong colonial character, especially in today's isolated island era. The government's promulgation of wartime financial stabilization laws and regulations based on national policy often encounters difficulties due to incomplete legal rights, sometimes even leading to distorted phenomena. The settlement validity of transfer drafts, initially confirmed by laws and regulations and then denied by the courts and the government, is one example of this distorted phenomenon. Even the recent government measures regarding foreign exchange, revising the "Foreign Exchange Application Regulations" to the "Imported Goods Foreign Exchange Application Regulations" and promulgating the "Prohibition of Imported Goods Measures," cannot be said to be unaffected by Shanghai's illegal foreign exchange black market. And the failure to fully maintain Shanghai's legal rights is an important factor contributing to this unique environment.</p>
<p>Research and Criticism</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Private Prosecution and the Victim (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mu Weijun</p>
<p>How Victims Can Utilize Private Prosecution Procedures</p>
<p>If a criminal case meets the above-mentioned positive and negative requirements, it is legal for the victim to initiate a private prosecution and request a public prosecution. Therefore, in situations where the requirements for private prosecution are met, the victim can choose to initiate a private prosecution or file a complaint requesting a public prosecution. Although the private prosecution procedure is designed to protect individual legal rights, the benefits it offers to victims are often overlooked by the general public. Consequently, victims often only file complaints requesting a public prosecution for crimes that meet the requirements for private prosecution, unaware of the potential advantages of utilizing the private prosecution procedure. The benefits of the private prosecution procedure for victims are outlined below:</p>
<p>If the victim wishes to pursue a public prosecution, they can file a complaint with the prosecutor or judicial police officer (in the Shanghai concessions, with the police). While this procedure is simpler than private prosecution in terms of formalities, Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "if the prosecutor concludes the investigation of the same case, a private prosecution cannot be initiated again." Therefore, after a complaint is filed, if the prosecutor concludes the investigation, regardless of whether the result is prosecution or not, the victim loses the right to initiate a private prosecution. Furthermore, Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "in cases involving crimes listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law, the prosecutor may make a disposition of non-prosecution if they deem it appropriate, taking into account the matters listed in Article 57 of the Criminal Law." If Anbo concludes the investigation and decides not to prosecute, the victim (original complainant) can only, according to Article 235 of the Criminal Procedure Law, within seven days of receiving the decision of non-prosecution, submit a written statement outlining the reasons for disagreement, through the original prosecutor, to the chief prosecutor or procurator general of the direct superior court, requesting reconsideration. There is no other means of redress.</p>
<p>Article 336 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "if a party is dissatisfied with the judgment of the lower court, they may appeal to the higher court." The term "party" in this context, according to Article 3 of the same law, refers to the prosecutor, the private prosecutor, and the defendant. Therefore, the prosecutor, the private prosecutor, and the defendant can all be the subjects of an appeal. However, because the parties in a public prosecution and a private prosecution are different, the subjects of appeal differ accordingly. The parties in a public prosecution are the prosecutor and the defendant, so those with the right to appeal are also the prosecutor and the defendant. Since the victim is not a party in a public prosecution, they naturally have no right to appeal. If the victim is the original complainant, they may request the prosecutor to appeal, but the prosecutor has the discretion to grant or deny the request and is not bound by it. In a private prosecution, the parties are the private prosecutor and the defendant, and those with the right to appeal are also the private prosecutor and the defendant. Therefore, a victim who initiates a private prosecution has the right to appeal if they are dissatisfied with the judgment of the private prosecution case, according to the law.</p>
<p>Article 491 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "a person who has suffered damage as a result of a crime may, in criminal proceedings, incidentally file a civil lawsuit, requesting compensation for their damages from the defendant and the person liable for compensation under the Civil Code." Therefore, if a victim has suffered damage as a result of a crime, whether in a private prosecution or a public prosecution, they may, according to Article 492 of the same law, file an incidental civil lawsuit after the initiation of criminal proceedings and before the conclusion of the second instance arguments. If a victim files a complaint requesting a public prosecution and the prosecutor concludes the investigation and decides not to prosecute, the victim can only request reconsideration according to the law and cannot initiate a private prosecution, as mentioned earlier. If the result of the reconsideration is still non-prosecution, the victim who has suffered damage as a result of the crime can only pay the litigation costs and file an incidental civil lawsuit in the civil court. This is because filing an incidental civil lawsuit, according to the law, must be done after the initiation of criminal proceedings to meet the requirement of being incidental.</p>
<p>Article 507, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that "if an incidental civil lawsuit is dismissed due to a judgment of acquittal, dismissal of prosecution, or non-acceptance in criminal proceedings, an appeal cannot be filed unless there is an appeal against the judgment in the criminal proceedings." In public prosecution proceedings, the victim is not a party to the criminal proceedings, so they are not entitled to be the subject of an appeal, as mentioned earlier. If the prosecutor does not appeal the judgment in the criminal proceedings, the victim cannot appeal the judgment dismissing the incidental civil lawsuit, even if they are dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Since the relationship between private prosecution and the victim is as described above, victims should know what to do when there is a situation where they can utilize the private prosecution procedure. (The End)</p>
<p>News</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bar Association</h3>
<p>It has been found that member Xu Zuoliang has submitted two proposals that have been processed and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Proposal Regarding Lawyers Wearing Neat Uniforms in Court to Emphasize the System</p>
<p>Judges, prosecutors, and lawyers are the three major professions in the judiciary. The state, in the solemn courtroom, specially permits lawyers to wear uniforms and sit in court to respect their position. Lawyers, in performing their duties, should not only fulfill their responsibility of integrity and trustworthiness, but also be mindful of their demeanor and etiquette. It has been observed that some lawyers appearing in court do not button their uniforms properly, and some even have their lapels open like cloaks, which is disrespectful to the system. The Shanghai court is subject to scrutiny by both Chinese and foreigners, and all lawyers should exercise self-restraint. It is hoped that in the future, when appearing in court, lawyers will wear neat uniforms and not neglect these minor details. Members may have occasional observations and dare to offer them without impropriety, requesting discussion and resolution to notify all members to pay attention to the system and respect etiquette. This request is addressed to the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>
<p>A Proposal Regarding Matters Requiring Attention and Correction in Court Trials of Criminal Cases</p>
<p>I rarely handle criminal defense cases. Recently, I observed in a certain court of the Special First Court that there are aspects of the trial of minor criminal cases that urgently need improvement. Article 306 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the appeal period and the appellate court for judgments subject to appeal shall be announced together. This shows that the legislator attaches great importance to the defendant's right to appeal. Therefore, the court should give the defendant ample opportunity to consider. However, in a certain court, the inquiry of whether the defendant wishes to appeal is not made by the judge but by a court clerk or bailiff immediately after the judge announces the judgment. If the defendant is not a repeat offender, they may not even know what it means to "accept" or "not accept." Many vaguely agree and then regret it later. Whether the defendant appeals is related to the length of their detention pending judgment. The judge should carefully analyze and explain the advantages and disadvantages of appealing or not appealing, so that the defendant understands clearly, and then ask the defendant to express their intention to appeal or not appeal. This is the proper way. The Shanghai court is subject to scrutiny by both Chinese and foreigners, and such an important inquiry is actually performed by a court clerk or bailiff on behalf of the judge. While it may be convenient in practice to have the talent of resolving cases with a few words, what about the prestige of the court? This is one aspect that should be corrected.</p>
<p>Article 283 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the presiding judge should, before announcing the conclusion of the debate, ask the defendant if they have anything to say. This is a right granted to the defendant by law and should not be neglected by the judge. However, the judge in a certain court often does not pay attention to this last inquiry to the defendant. This is another aspect that should be corrected.</p>
<p>Article 41 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the record should be read to the person being questioned or shown to them for review, and they should be asked to sign or affix their fingerprint immediately after the last line of the record. However, it has been observed that in a certain court, the person being questioned is only asked to sign or affix their fingerprint, without being read or shown the record. Moreover, the person being questioned may not even know the purpose of their signature or fingerprint. This is another aspect that should be corrected.</p>
<p>It is common to see court clerks writing summaries of judgments beside the judge after the judge announces the judgment, while simultaneously having the defendant make a uniform cross on the delivery receipt. It is unknown whether this summary has been delivered to the defendant. If it has been delivered to the defendant, why is it not signed by the defendant themselves? This is another aspect that should be corrected.</p>
<p>Judges and lawyers share a common responsibility to uphold the spirit of justice. Having observed these issues, I dare not remain silent and specially submit this proposal, requesting that it be presented to the court for attention and correction. Your approval of its appropriateness is respectfully awaited. This is addressed to the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(Question) Man A and Woman B (both adults) mutually desire to marry, but Woman B's parents object and state that if she marries Man A, they will definitely persuade her to divorce him. Now, Man A and Woman B are participating in a group wedding, but the regulations require the signatures of both parties' parents. Since Woman B's parents object, it is difficult to obtain their signatures. Therefore, the following questions arise: (1) If Man A forges Woman B's parents' seal for the marriage certificate (Man A's seal is not a problem), is the certificate valid? (2) If Woman B's parents discover this and sue Man A for forging the seal, can the sentence be mitigated or can he be found not guilty according to the law? (3) If Woman B angers her parents as a result and they even announce her disownment in the newspaper or use other methods to declare her separation from the family, what are the legal provisions for this situation? If Woman B is indeed disowned by her parents, will her right to inherit their estate in the future still exist? (Gao Ji)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) The fact that Man A forged Woman B's parents' seal on the marriage certificate does not render the entire certificate invalid. (2) If Man A's forgery of the seal causes damage to the public or others, he shall be held liable for the crime under Article 217, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. (3) The relationship between parents and children is based on blood ties and cannot be severed by legal acts. However, if the parents have a legitimate reason, they may, according to Article 1128 of the Civil Code, order their family members to separate from the household. (4) Whether Woman B loses her right to inherit depends on whether any of the circumstances listed in Article 1145, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code exist. In conclusion, since Woman B is an adult, she has the right to decide on her own marriage, and a marriage certificate is not a legally required document, so Man A should not forge a seal and violate the law. (Huang)</p>
<p>(Question) (1) Suppose A has two wives, each with one son. When the first wife died, her eldest son's name was inscribed on the ancestral tablet for worship. Later, the eldest son died, and then the eldest grandson died. According to local custom, after A dies, his great-grandson B should have his name inscribed on the tablet and issue funeral announcements, specifically enjoying a certain amount of sacrificial land. However, A had recorded in his diary that he was abolishing the great-grandson and replacing him with his second son C, and that the sacrificial land would also be given to him, with a draft funeral announcement attached. After A dies, C performs his duties according to his father's wishes, but B protests based on custom. (1) Does A's diary have the effect of a will? (2) Is B's protest reasonable? (3) Does C have the right to the title and enjoyment of the sacrificial land? (Tian Tong)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) If it meets the requirements for a written will, it can take effect. (2) No. (3) Yes.</p>
<p>(Question) A has one son and one daughter. The son is married, and the daughter is married. A passed away four years ago, leaving a large estate. Two years ago, the son, based on a will, only gave his sister (i.e., the daughter) 200 yuan in silver. (1) Can the daughter now request a share of the estate from her brother? (2) What circumstances are considered an infringement of inheritance rights under Article 1146 of the Civil Code? (Zhang Lifu)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) If the statute of limitations has not expired, she can request it. (2) There are various different circumstances. All those who should inherit but have not inherited are included. (Wu Guangding)</p>
<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>The Merits and Demerits of Women's Inheritance Rights</h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Before the implementation of the Civil Code, inheritance of parents' estates was limited to men. Therefore, those without sons had to adopt a son to carry on the family line, while biological daughters could not inherit. Later, due to the efforts of women's associations to advocate for gender equality, women were granted the same inheritance rights as men. This is a benefit. However, according to Article 1148 of the Civil Code, inheritance involves inheriting all rights and obligations of the deceased's property. Furthermore, Article 1153 of the same law states that heirs are jointly liable for the debts of the deceased. Therefore, if women obtain inheritance rights to parents with an estate, they can share it equally with their brothers. However, if they inherit from parents with debts and do not perform limited inheritance or renounce inheritance within the statutory period, the result will inevitably be that all of the parents' debts will be transferred to them. This is the demerit. However, there have been reports of brothers and sisters fighting over property, but there have been no reports of fighting over debts. Is this the true meaning of equality?</p>

<h3>The Evolution of "Serial Pictures"</h3>
<p>— (Jun Xiang)</p>
<p>For Thirty or Forty Years, "Serial Pictures" Have Been Incessantly Infusing Readers with Potent Poison</p>
<p>"Serial pictures" are also known as "person books" or "small books." The reason why they have been popular for thirty or forty years, and welcomed by the general public and children, is twofold: firstly, the meaning of the pictures in "serial pictures" is straightforward, and the text portion is at least much clearer than that in "chapter novels," making it easy for ordinary people with limited education to fully understand; and secondly, the rental price of "serial pictures" is cheap, suitable for the economic capacity of ordinary people. In addition, most of the content of "serial pictures" is full of various kinds of "low-level interests," so their appeal is naturally quite large.</p>
<p>In the early days, "serial pictures," whether in form or content, were far inferior to those of later years: they were not continuous, mostly depicting one or two pictures from each chapter of a "chapter novel," fragmented and scattered, making it impossible to see the development and evolution of the entire story. The characters in the pictures were also drawn extremely crudely and simply, without background or explanation. The paper used was glossy paper, and the printing was extremely poor.</p>
<p>Later, "serial pictures" gradually began to improve. Firstly, in order to make the pictures more interesting and vivid, the authors of "serial pictures" connected the story content, allowing readers to get a clear overview of the entire story. Secondly, a "description column" was added above each picture, sometimes using the original text as the basis for the picture, and sometimes the authors themselves wrote a summary. Suitable backgrounds for the story's transformation were further added to each picture, and the art of drawing characters was much better than in the early days, but the paper was still glossy, and the printing naturally did not improve.</p>
<p>Recently, "serial pictures" have made great progress in form. The paper has been changed from eye-damaging glossy paper to newspaper paper. The drawings are more refined and artistic than in the past, and the descriptions have been changed by the authors to be more clear, popular, and easy for the public to fully understand.</p>
<p>In terms of form, "serial pictures" are indeed constantly improving. However, when we examine the evolution of the story content in "serial pictures" over the past thirty or forty years, we have little reason to be optimistic.</p>
<p>In the early days, the story content of "serial pictures" was not continuous. More elaborate ones would depict two pictures for each chapter, while simpler ones would mostly select a few of the most exciting and well-known segments of a story to draw. Therefore, a rather long story could only fill a thin little book. The authors themselves did not create, and the drawing was based on a few popular novels left by Ming and Qing novelists, with occasional adaptations from Peking opera.</p>
<p>In the second period of "serial pictures," although the stories were connected, the drawing was still based on a few popular chapter novels. Although there were also fresher works with Shanghai society as the theme, such as "Yan Ruisheng" and "Jiang Laowu's Martyrdom."</p>
<p>During that period, swordplay novels and movies were very popular. The authors of "serial pictures" saw through people's psychology of worshiping such superhuman heroes - swordsmen, so they fabricated many swordplay "serial pictures," gaining a large group of middle- and lower-class readers and infusing them with potent poison.</p>
<p>Even now, swordplay "serial pictures" still occupy two-thirds of the stalls, which is truly the most lamentable point in the "history of serial pictures."</p>
<p>The Emergence of Movie Stills</p>
<p>"Serial pictures" with popular novels as their theme were about to disappear due to the public's gradually waning interest in them, and "movie stills" took their place.</p>
<p>The emergence of "movie stills" has only been in the last two or three years. They have also attracted many readers. Many ordinary people who look down on movies see the content of each film through "movie stills." Now, almost every film has a "movie still" "serial picture" published within half a month of its release.</p>
<p>As for serial pictures created by the authors themselves that are in line with the current era, they are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, an absolute minority. I have only seen one, "Refugee Tears," which uses the Shanghai refugee circle as its theme.</p>
<p>The above is a brief report on the evolution of "serial pictures" over the past thirty or forty years. Strictly speaking, "serial pictures" over the past thirty or forty years have not only failed to take on the task of educating the public, but on the contrary, in order to boost sales, they have brought various potent poisons to the public - haven't we seen many pure and innocent children, after seeing the various forms of swordsmen in the pictures, become obsessed and want to run to some mountain or cave to find those sword immortals? Now that the War of Resistance has entered its second stage, "serial pictures" have not only failed to cooperate with the War of Resistance, but have redoubled their efforts to anesthetize the public.</p>
<p>It is said that a group of progressive painters are beginning to use "serial pictures" to cooperate with the War of Resistance and use them as a powerful tool to educate the public. I hope they will make some good achievements in the near future and set an example!</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes Benefit from Village Cooperation, Myriad Miles of Waves Witness Flight across the Sea</p>
<p>In the end, the cooperative store became even more impressive. People needed to obtain their daily necessities from the cooperative store, and to meet their needs, the store stocked an increasing variety of goods. At the end of that year, Zhu Aili calculated the number of goods sold in the store and found that there were over three hundred and forty-five kinds. He said with a smile, "People have always referred to those large general stores in cities as department stores. But in reality, they have more than a hundred kinds of goods. Even this small cooperative store of ours already has over three hundred kinds of goods. The reason is that there are many things we don't have here. Otherwise, with a little more flexibility, we could easily have a thousand kinds of goods and be called a 'thousand-goods store'." Originally, when they first started this cooperative store, they established a rule that they would not sell luxury goods. Moreover, the initial regulation was that items costing more than one yuan would not be sold. This was not only because they didn't sell luxury goods, but also because their capital was too small. If they were to sell items costing several yuan or more, they would quickly run out of working capital after stocking just a few dozen items. Later, after the capital was increased to one thousand yuan, they relaxed the rule to not selling items costing more than two yuan. In reality, the cooperative store never stocked luxury goods. For example, in the socks section, they only stocked cotton socks and thread socks, not silk stockings. In the soap section, they only stocked laundry soap, bath soap, medicated soap, etc., but not expensive floral-scented soaps. Other sections, such as the cosmetics section, also had some essential women's products. However, things like perfume costing several yuan a bottle, as well as novel and glamorous cosmetics, especially imported foreign goods, were strictly prohibited from being sold. Cigarettes were not sold at first, but later they were, because cigarettes have recently come under state control, becoming a state-owned enterprise and a public monopoly. This cooperative store gradually expanded, and a capital of one thousand yuan was no longer sufficient. But later, it became a custom that all villagers residing in Liberty Village had to buy shares, and everyone became a shareholder in the cooperative store. Even those who moved to Liberty Village from elsewhere had to buy shares and become a member of the cooperative store in order to enjoy the rights of this cooperative. Every shareholder of the cooperative store was given a booklet. If they wanted to obtain any goods, they could use the booklet to get them, and the accounts would be settled at the end of each month. However, the value of the goods taken could not exceed their share capital—one yuan—unless they had previously deposited funds in the cooperative store, in which case this limit did not apply. Every six months, the accounts would be settled, and all profits, after deducting expenses, would be distributed to the shareholders. Many such consumer cooperatives have now been established in China. The beauty is that the customers are also the shopkeepers, and the shopkeepers are also the customers, one and two, two and one.

<h3>Sponsored by the Silver and Banking Industry Amateur Association: Exhibition of Fan Paintings by Famous Shanghai Artists</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Gathering Masterpieces of Renowned Figures from Shanghai's Art Scene in One Place</p>
<p>The Silver and Banking Industry Amateur Association – shouldn't this name be familiar to us? From tea servers, messengers, and veteran clerks to managers and bank presidents; from refugees crying for food in refugee camps to enthusiastic individuals presiding over disaster relief efforts, to all those who generously donated to the refugees, no one is unaware of this organization.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple and clear:</p>
<p>Because it is the only large group in the financial industry that has developed from its own members. It has been so in the past, it is so now, and it will continue to be so in the future. It tirelessly promotes the work efficiency, academic cultivation, leisure life, and welfare of employees in Shanghai's financial industry; at the same time, it has never forgotten the mission given to it by the times, namely the disaster relief work that Shanghai should be undertaking at present. Through ball games, drama performances, the highest level of enthusiasm from its members, and the painstaking efforts of its colleagues, it has always stood on the front line of disaster relief, constantly appealing and pleading for the suffering people.</p>
<p>Recently, it is hosting another exhibition of fan paintings by famous Shanghai artists.</p>
<p>Due to the environment, the original idea of using the proceeds from the sale of the works, either through commissions or entirely, for charity and disaster relief has been cancelled. It has been changed to replenish the funds for the calligraphy, painting, and seal engraving class of the Association's Academic Committee and the library, and to purchase medical and health equipment for the Welfare Committee.</p>
<p>Therefore, this "Exhibition of Fan Paintings by Famous Shanghai Artists" is different from ordinary fan painting exhibitions. It includes masterpieces by the top masters of the current Shanghai art scene, such as Wu Hufan, Wu Daiqiu, Qin Qinghui, Tang Dingzhi, Feng Chaoran, Zhao Shuru, Xu Bangda, and other gentlemen, as well as recent excellent works by well-known painters in the silver and banking industry, such as Pan Zixie, Ye Yuanqing, and Chen Zishou. Efforts are being made to actively solicit contributions from them. (Because there are many famous artists, they cannot all be listed.) Here, it is also necessary to add that the Association also hopes that those artists who may have been overlooked or forgotten to be solicited, and those who have an affinity for calligraphy and painting, will enthusiastically display their own and collected works in this exhibition.</p>
<p>The pre-determined target for collecting fan paintings is one thousand pages, and the exhibition location is the Association's headquarters at 334 Nanjing Road. The exhibition dates are from July 23rd to July 31st. The days are getting closer and closer. In these few days, not only all the staff of the Association's Academic Committee and Welfare Committee have been fully mobilized for this fan painting exhibition, actively carrying out their work. Even honorary directors of the Association, such as Xu Jijing, Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Boquan, Lin Kanghou, and Pei Yunqing, several senior figures in the financial industry, are extremely concerned and enthusiastic about this fan painting exhibition. In addition to serving as sponsors, they have also each agreed to write or paint two pages of fan paintings, making this exhibition even more impressive.</p>
<p>Wait and see: All art lovers, all those who wish to obtain a beautiful fan painting in the hot summer, this exhibition of fan paintings by famous Shanghai artists will give you a twelve-point satisfactory harvest! (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Strong Man, Glamorous Woman</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Winner Take All"</p>
<p>Produced by 20th Century Fox, Screening at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>"Strong Man, Glamorous Woman" depicts how American boxing promoters speculate and deceive boxers, using them as tools to make money. This kind of theme is naturally not new to "Strong Man, Glamorous Woman." But in "Strong Man, Glamorous Woman," there is one point that makes us pay even more attention, that is, after the boxer Steve became famous, he did not restrain himself, became proud and dissolute, not knowing that his future would be completely destroyed in an instant. Therefore, it makes me think of recent rumors that many film industry employees went to gamble in the "badlands" of Western Shanghai, and after losing heavily, their behavior became improper, and they were dismissed by the company. These "rumors" may indeed be "groundless," but they are not without "clues." Let's not talk about anything else for the moment, but destroying one's own future with one's own hands is already such a terrible risk!</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the film's director can also remove redundant scenes and make the entire film develop smoothly. In the three boxing scenes, he tightly grasps the tense atmosphere at the time and analyzes the different emotions of each character. The first time: Steve replaced Boley in the ring, and was not noticed by the crowd. Only Gambini was overjoyed. When he struck, even Walker, who was running the boxing business, was shocked. The second time: When Steve was defeated, the director simultaneously depicted Gambini's disappointment after losing money, and Shirley's grief and shame. The third time: In a situation where everyone was ecstatic, Steve won a great victory. The director's handling of the atmosphere in these three different boxing scenes is indeed very skillful.</p>
<p>The character of Gambini is also successfully portrayed. He is simple-minded and easily emotional. His character is clearly outlined in every action. Naturally, Henry Armetta, who plays this role, is also an excellent actor.</p>
<p>Tony Martin, who plays Steve, is merely competent. Gloria Stuart, who recently visited Shanghai, plays Shirley, and her performance is average.</p>
<h3>Yan Lugong's Calligraphy in the Guoguang Art Journal</h3>
<p>— Wu Hufan</p>
<p>Su Dongpo once said: "With Yan Lugong, the world's talents are exhausted." Yan's calligraphy was so highly regarded by the wise men of the past. When young children enter school, the teacher teaches them calligraphy, and they must take Yan Zhenqing (Gongquan), and Yan's style is more common than Liu Gongquan's, together becoming the standard for the world and future generations. Yan's calligraphy is robust and vigorous, upright and majestic, sweeping away the weaving and charming customs of the Six Dynasties and early Tang Dynasty, returning to simplicity, like Du Fu's poetry and Han Yu's prose, all suitable to be masters for a hundred generations. There are many ink rubbings handed down, but very few genuine works. Those that I have seen are the "Memorial to My Nephew Ji Ming," the "Yingzhou Post" in running script, and the "Autobiographical Imperial Edict" and the "Bamboo Mountain Couplet" in regular script. The "Memorial to Ji Ming" is now in the Forbidden City, the "Yingzhou Post" is in the Li family, and the "Imperial Edict" is in the Pu family, and they are not easy to see again. The "Bamboo Mountain Couplet" was previously collected by the Tibetan Ye family, and now it is appreciated by Mr. Zhang Shijian of Wuxing. Its calligraphy is very ancient and profound, majestic and unique, as if emerging from harsh self-cultivation, simple but not unrefined, unrestrained but not excessive, majestic like the heavy bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, compared with the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi and Yu Shinan, it still seems to be merely pursuing beauty.</p>
<p>Xu Bangda recently compiled the "Guoguang Art Journal," which collects and prints the traces of ancient bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings to promote art and literature. His intention is excellent. The first page of the initial issue is the genuine work of Yan Lugong's "Bamboo Mountain," showing that he knows how to choose materials. In the past, Zhang's secret collection was treasured exclusively, but now the rare texts of the art world are appreciated together. His contribution is truly indelible, hence this record.</p>
