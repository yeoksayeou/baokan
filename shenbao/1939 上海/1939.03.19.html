<p>社評</p>
<h3>論最近戰局</h3>
<p>近二三星期來，歐洲大陸的風雲極度緊張，上海租界的局面又十分嚴重；同時中國境內各地的戰事也一度劇烈，到目前才又緩和了下來。這種一張一弛的局面，說明了日本的在華軍事，雖不至一時就會崩潰·但是已經形成了强弩之末的情勢；同時又證實了中國持久抗戰理論的正確性，事實上中國軍事已經有了相當的勝利把握。不過此種一張一弛的局面，以後還要屢屢的發生着·而且中國的英勇鬥士還必須繼續忍受着極大的犧牲，才能夠一步緊一步把敵人趕跑去，直到完全光復河山爲止。</p>
<p>最近的戰事大概可以分幾方面說：湖北方面，日軍企圖奪取襄樊，如果襄樊得手，不但可以鞏固武漢，還可以北趨鄖陽，由武關進窺西北，南指荊宜，控制入川要路和洞庭湖的上游。但是進攻襄樊的日軍，一路滯留鍾祥，侷促於襄河東岸，已成反攻為守的狀態；另一路在淅河一帶，遭逢了堅强的抵抗，死傷竟達三萬多名，目前不能有何動作，所以這一方面的企圖顯然已經停頓了。山西方面，日軍以鐵路沿綫的太原，臨汾，新絳等處為根據地，企圖分南北兩路西進渡河，攻略西北；可是屢决出擊，都遭挫折，後方側面，又都碰着英勇的游擊軍隊的嚴重襲擊，傷亡重大，結果祗得退居原地·無尺寸的進展。蘇北方面，日軍企圖打通隴海路東段·由銅山及連雲港陸海兩道，會攻淮陰；雖然淮陰已告陷落，可是南部揚州的日軍被阻於昭關壩，南通的日軍又徘徊於如皋泰縣一帶，無法向北取得聯絡，並且最近泗陽漣水已有克復的消息、那麼淮陰的日軍簡直已經陷於孤立·控制蘇北的企圖已很難成功了。廣東方面，海南島雖然情形特殊·然而日軍始終無法深入內地；至於粵江流域，日軍雖頻頻出動·可是作用祗在防禦華軍的反攻，並沒有什麼積極的意義。此外，贛北方面，日軍有從鄱陽湖東繞道進攻南昌的企圖，可是華軍的準備已很充分，幾天以來戰事並沒有多大的發展。浙東方面，日海軍雖屢决揚言要進攻臨海，但是目的僅在牽制華軍反攻杭州的兵力，所以根本並沒有進攻的事實，祗是虛張聲勢罷了。</p>
<p>在最近各地的戰局裏，顯然地可以發見卞列幾個特點：第一，日軍已經不能像以前那樣地各方協同，併力攻取某一點，而祗是在各處局部的發動。並且發動的目標也很不一致，與其說是積極性的準備新進攻，母寗說是消極性的防禦已得的軍事據點，這足以證明日軍已從主動轉入了被動的階段。第二，日軍自身的各部分已失却了協動性。例如鄂中日軍企圖奪取襄樊，豫東的日軍却並無西進呼應的意思；又如徐海日軍南攻淸江浦的時候，通揚的日軍又並不積極策應。這裏可以看出不是日軍自已號令的不能統一·就是他們的配備上已露出了窘態。第三，中國的游擊戰已漸漸發生了積極的效果。例如武漢日軍北攻時，鄂東鄂南的游擊戰就大大的展開，牽制了日軍的前進，又如蘇北淮陰一經失陷，運河東西就立卽佈滿了游擊部隊，使日軍陷於孤立，此外魯南，魯東，浙西，冀南各地，游擊戰都廣泛地發展着，牽制了日軍很多的兵力，使他們窮於應付；至於山西高地游擊部隊的控制華北局勢，阻止日軍西犯的企圖，已經有了一年多的歷史，現在竟越戰越得法，更有根本殲滅日軍的可能。第四，中國軍隊的戰鬥力已經日漸加强，這决鍾祥戰役裏中日兩軍的傷亡數已成一對一的比例。總結上述幾點，可知單就軍事形勢而論，中國的抗戰已經轉入了有利的階段，何况軍事以外，還有外交，經濟等各方面，中日間的一消一長，都已在轉變的關鍵中呢！</p>
<p>中國目前正把握着這種軍事外交經濟互相配合的有利形勢，不久的將來就要展開一個廣大的反攻塲面，英勇的鬥士們，應該為着預期的偉大勝利而歡喜吧！</p>

<h3>違反諾言信義安在　張伯倫警吿希特勒</h3>
<p>行施暴力終必自食其報　英國對德政策轉趨強硬</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今夜在伯明罕演說、其言曰、歐洲現所發生之大事、巳使任何他事為决要問題、余覺在座諸君所欲聞者、厥為英政府對於此種糾紛事件的意見之表示、世界輿情今所受之震駭、較諸德政府前所加者允為尖銳、此乃確無可疑者、人心如此擾動、將有何種影響、莫可預卜、惟余確信其將來之結果、必甚遠大也、星期三日余因未接充分情報、故對於當時余所認為未便多置批評之局勢、不得不僅作愼重而有的束之言論、詞稍冷靜而偏於客觀、致誤會紛起、以為余對此事件、無甚感觸、此實錯誤、余願今夜糾正之、</p>
<h3>首爲绥靖政策辯護</h3>
<p>批評者謂捷克之被佔據、乃去秋余游德國之直接後果、並謂近事之結果、旣為慕尼黑協定之撕毀、則余德國之游完全失策、允可證明、更謂此乃首相個人政策、故捷克命運必須由首相負之云、上述結論全無理由、余之往游德國、其第一主要原因、為當時局勢險惡已極、可挽回歐洲戰爭之唯一機會、似僅在此而已、余游德國之第一目的卒能達到、而歐洲和平賴以保全、苟無此游、則歐洲今日哭者不知有幾十萬家、誠然余無須辯護德國之行、苟當日無之、試問時局將如何、英法俄所能為者、未必果能保全捷克免於侵略與摧殘、從吾人出兵討德、而在可怖的損失之後卒獲勝利、然吾人亦决不致造捷克如凡爾賽和的所規定也、余赴慕尼黑以推進所謂歐洲綏靖政策、欲此政策成功、必列强放棄其獨覇歐洲之野心、而以覓取適合情理的便利、俾發展其自己利源鞏固其自己國際貿易·及改善其自已人民的狀况為專務而後可、</p>
<h3>德莊嚴諾言猶在耳</h3>
<p>當時希特勒在慕尼黑曾發諾言、聲明其在歐洲之土地野心、不越出蘇台德地之外、希特勒且在柏林重申此旨、余　於此種一再申明之擔保、余覺大可作捷克問題從此解决之希望、蓋當日慕尼黑情形、固似可進行綏靖政策也、惟非至綏靖政策業已成立而爲他國所接受後、余不準備稍弛戒備故在慕尼黑會議之後、吾國國防程序着實進行而加以擴張、以期補救在危局中所發現之某種弱點焉、余確知慕尼黑會議後、英國大多數人民皆與余同一希望、而急紛綏靖政策進行無滯、但在今日此種希望全被擊破、此余與多數國人同一失望而憤懣不已者也、最近事件如何可與余頃所述之擔保相融合乎、余旣為慕尼黑協定簽字者之一、苟希特勒以為應取銷前的、則應依照慕尼黑宜言規定、而就商於余、詎不此是圖、希特勒竟獨斷獨行、</p>
<h3>捷克人民竟遭茶毒</h3>
<p>當捷克總統尙未接到其力所不能拒絕之德國要求時、德軍已出動在途、不數小時而入捷京、强令捷克爲其附庸、於是捷克勇武人民、倏遭荼毒、自由被削、獨立巳亡、吾人對之能不予以同情乎、所謂不復有土地野心者而今何在、所謂决不吸收捷克人民於德國者而今何在、希特勒在貝許德斯加登鎭主張蘇台德地與捷克脫離時、向余力爭之自决主義而今何在、如此莊嚴之擔保一再聲明者竟被置諸不顧苟尙能輕易覔得良好理由以掩飾其非、則同一方面所發之任何其他擔保、安得不發生如何可以信任之問題乎、本星期之事件、由於德政府完全不顧其自定原則而造成者、</p>
<h3>新冒險嘗試的起點</h3>
<p>不得不使吾人相問曰、此豈為舊的冒險嘗試行為之結局乎、抑新的冒險嘗試行為之起點乎、此豈為加諸弱小國家之最後打聲乎、抑尙有繼之而起者乎、此得勿為以武力支配世界的嘗試之一種步驟乎、此乃嚴重緊急問題、恕余今夜不解答之、惟余確知不獨德國之隣邦、即距離較遠之他國、甚至遠在歐洲以外之各國、亦將對此問題予以嚴重緊急之考慮也、就現有景象觀之、此種趨勢業巳開始、顯將迅速進展，</p>
<h3>維護自由引爲職志</h3>
<p>以吾人本身言，吾人當然先須注意於英帝國內之各份子、决及於與英國關係密切之法國、吾人現必須以時局嚴重性所需要的實任心檢討時局、凡與國家安全有關者、皆必在檢討之列、吾人必須再從國家安全之立塲、注視吾人國家生活所繫之各點、為和平計、固無物不可犧牲、惟有一物不可犧牲者、即吾人千百年來所享之自由、永不放棄是、余固不準備使吾國受新的而漫無限制之束縛、但外人如謂吾國不準備以其全部力量、參加抵拒挑戰之行動、則其錯誤莫此為甚、余作此言、余確信余不獨獲有吾國全體人民之贊助·同情、與信任、且得英帝國全部及世界各他國愛護和平、但更愛護自由者之贊同云、聽衆聞張伯倫末段言論後、擊掌聲與歡呼聲相繼不絕、聽衆旋向首相致謝、首相答曰、吾人無須懊喪、英國為强大國家、較六個月前更為堅强、凡强暴與不公道之行為、遲早必食其報、德國每一侵略行為、巳使德國前途發生新危險、余敢預言、德國將來必深惡其政府今所爲者云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美法好評</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）英首相昨在伯明罕城所發表之演說、此間政界人士咸予好評、均謂英國態度業巳轉變、對於德國不復以妥協姑息為事、換言之、張伯倫業已坦然承認前此所行「綏靖政策」實屬失着、並已表示願追隨羅斯福總統、而以民治自由之擁護者自居、是可欣幸也、至以美國輿論而論、原來有贊成綏靖政策者、亦有擁護羅斯福總統之政策者、及至今日、英國政策旣巳變更、在美國輿論方面、自必連帶發生重大影響、此外更有一事可述、即張伯倫首相昨晚發表演說時、美國多數要人均藉無綫電遙事聽取、深覺其語氣中、流露其為希特勒所愚弄之意云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國各報咸認英相張伯倫昨在伯明罕演說之重要、如欲加以判斷、必須較側重於張氏著名之保守性質、甚於演詞所用頗為嚴重之詞句、小日報稱、張氏前會發表德國對於其政府之行為、必將痛加悔恨之言論、張氏之作此語、蓋已深知必須以武力對待武力、、各種和解之努力、皆被認為懦弱云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>德義印象</h3>
<p>（柏林）此間各報迄未載英相張伯倫演詞隻字、官塲某發言人對路透訪員稱、德國官員未有時間透澈研究之、但政界另一發言人則謂、就時局言之、張伯倫之演詞極為偏激而失公允、張伯倫有此態度、殆由於羅斯福言論之影響、英法歡迎此種議論之程度、已在德國有深切之印象云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英首相昨在伯明罕發表演說、嚴辭抨擊希特勒之後、此間各界人士、在表面上雖若不甚重視、實則不能無所感動、外交界人士有謂、此項演說、意義非常重大、前途影響如何、未可限量、其允足注意者、厥為美國方面業已發生反響、該國現行中立法、在短時期之內、即將修正云、（十八日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>羅國寬慰</h3>
<p>（羅馬）此間聞英首相張伯倫昨在伯明罕所發之演說、大為寬慰、因張氏聲明英國將不放棄其在歐洲東南之利益也、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日下午五時、英內閣召集特別會議、聞英內閣將攷慮對德方違反慕尼黑協定一點、提出抗議、苟內閣通過向德抗議一節、則亦須暫緩提出、蓋英方現正在等待希特勒發表答覆張伯倫之演詞也、外傳英法美蘇將成立反全能國共同陣綫、觀乎義國對德侵捷態度之嚴峻、此舉不無可能、（十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間政界人士頃宣稱、英法美蘇四國政府代表、有在倫敦進行談話之說、迄今雖未證實、但英國主管方面、確擬邀請蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫前來倫敦一行、此外、政界人士幷就張伯倫首相昨在伯明罕城所發表之演說加以評論、認為首相在此决事變中所獲得之敎訓、業巳充分認識、因此即當以「現實主義的政策」、代替「理想主義的政策」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美政府發表宣言　譴責德國行動爲非法</h3>
<p>尊重國際法紀始可保持和平　羅總統認中立法有修正必要</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務副卿威爾斯、昨日得羅總統之許可、發表宜言、譴責德國行動之在妄非法、謂「美國政府曾屢决聲述、美國深信世界和平之保持、惟有世界各國能對世界秩序與法紀予以尊重支持而後可、美國政府對於以武力消滅一個獨立民族自由之行動、不能不予以痛斥、美國政府之立塲早巳宣示世界、即美國向來側重條的與諾言之神聖、向來主張不應干預他國之內政、且曾屢次表示其對於軍事侵略之斥責、國際間無法紀之行動及武力行動、皆爲危害世界和平及文化基礎之行動、過去三月中所發生之事變、已足證明美國主張之絕對準確、即世界和平必須以各國皆能遵守世界和平之原則、而後始能發生效力、」（十八日美聯電）同時羅斯福總統於威爾斯發出此項宜言後、亦對記者言、美國因歐局之變遷、非另訂新中立法不可、並表示此事現正在與國會領袖及各國防領袖商量中、按羅斯福總統於本年一月四日對國會之咨文中、曾指出現行中立法之不適用、因其不獨無補於和平國家、抑且有助於好戰之國家、據當時總統言、爲遏阻侵略之橫流計、美國除用戰爭方法之外、更有較空言更爲有力之方法、總統昨晚又表示、美國對於弗朗哥並不準備予以承認、同時美財政部對於前予捷克之優惠條款亦宣佈撤銷此後捷貨進口、將與德貨同受美國高關稅之限制、至於關島港口工程發展案、總統表示將歸入河道海口工程案中辦理、足見美國對於關島設防仍將進行、藉以警吿遠東之侵略國家也、（十八日美聯電）</p>
<p>判决口吻　極堪彎味</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據此間消息、副國務卿威爾斯今日正式發表譴責德國政府在妄非法之言論、係有意屛棄有禮貌之外交辭令、而用判决之口吻、據接近政府之發言人宣稱、吾人對於侵略、可母須冉作可憐的洗刷、最少限度、世人現在巳能見到吾人之立塲云、民主黨議員金氏今日在參院發表演說稱、英法對於捷克遭刧之態度、爲見危不救、渠願見美國與各侵略國斷絕一切關係云、此間對於英國駐德大使已奉召返國之消息、甚表歡迎、謂此舉雖嫌稍遲仍可使英國與去年十一月間羅斯福總統之行動、聯成一綫云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>閏國仗義　援助弱小</p>

<p>捷貸輸美　徵附加稅</p>
<p>（華盛頓）負責人士頃宣稱、德國兼併捷克之後、美政府不擬直接或間接承認爲合法舉動、但摩拉維亞與波希米亞兩省貨物、他日輸入美國時當令其繳納附加稅、一如德國本部貨物然云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>捷駐美使館</p>
<p>拒不移交與德</p>

<p>久佔該島　德國軍事專家近自香港啟程赴海南島要港海口、從事彼等之工作、聞若干德　軍器與軍用新飛機亦在海口起岸、加强日軍在該島之地位、據此間消息靈通人七聲稱、謠傳防共公約不僅聯合反對共產主義而已之說、由此似可證實、彼等並接得重慶傳來關於日軍進佔海南島陰謀之</p>
<p>驚人消息　據此消息稱、德意日已商妥在歐洲與遠東打擊英法、以大量軍器與轟炸機供給弗朗哥將軍、用以突然進攻法國、而地中海上之德意艦隊、則困擾英國海軍、俾阻其駛來遠東、日本攫得海南島後、利用該島爲根據地、進攻華南之英法殖民地與租借地、如香港·廣州灣·與越南、故日本悍然進侵海南島、但其軸心同盟國則未實行計劃、此則由於弗朗哥突然</p>
<p>改變意向　之故、因英相張伯倫已使弗朗哥深信共謀歐洲與遠東之英國利益、不若獲得英國之經濟援助爲有價値、是項陰謀、乃歸失敗、軸心國家對此陰謀之中途夭折、頗爲惶惑云、此說或係來自海外中國外交界、雖不能證實之、惟其影響於華南者殊巨、故此間對於是項情報、均加以批評、</p>

<h3>山明水秀　宋哲元養疴陽朔</h3>
<p>縣長月薪微薄生活清苦　張國權談李白勇於作戰</p>
<p>常人自陽朔寄</p>
<p>陽朔通訊二月秒，正是雨季重來南國的時節。筆者應駐桂的國際友人之邀，偷閒作陽朔的遊訪。汽車穿出桂林南門，向着赴陽朔的大道行進，桂林的城郊和山嵐逐漸溶沒於沉重的曉霧中。天空的濕雲，從密岫中推擁出來，父遊栘的向另一羣山林中流去。有時送來濛濛的細雨，有時夾着微冷的水珠。公路上浮着一層薄薄的黃泥漿，一些不深的坎坷映着山影，不時讓載重汽車的膠輪濺起黃濁的水花。戰時運輸的忙碌，使公路也蒙上一重艱苦仟重的形色。從公路兩邊，農田與松林直擴展到不遠的山麓，假如是黃土山，那麼辛勞的廣西農人把山麓到山腰也闢成農田，看得不能淸楚的農作物，已堅定在迎着風雨。近處，菜花如黃金灑地，大片大片的在車旁溜過，田畦中蠶豆也已展開紫葩，這宛然是江南暮春的鄉景，喚起了我這江南人的鄉思。汽車趕上了由桂林出發到南方去工作的廣西學生軍第一團，這一千多男女靑年，在桂林受了三個月的訓練，現在將去發動和組織南方的人民，準備在必要時，保國衛民，他們全副武裝，在泥濘的公路邊和原野上行軍，這一列綠色的靑年隊伍，正在爲衛護他背後的山林和田野而踏上戰塲。從桂林到陽朔是六十四公里，的合一百二十華里，愈近陽朔，兪覺陽朔與桂林近郊諸山有一個顯著的分野，桂林的山巒不可謂不奇，其奇在石，而陽朔諸山，却大都披上一層荊樹的外衣，郁郁靑靑，掩蔽蔽了崚嶒的怪石，特顯着一種古秀的風度，公路在陽朔以北三二十里內，幾乎就迴環曲折地穿行怪石之間。</p>
<p>施政一斑　陽朔東濱灕水，西南北三面，都是層疊的巒嶂。縣城爲山水所限，面樻恐尙不及四方里，人口只三百多家，除了三，六，九日的墟塲以外，沒有商業可言。縣城以北十八里的白沙墟，東南的福利墟，東北三四十里的興平墟，句圍着它，這幾個墟市擁有比縣城多幾倍的人口，有着縣城所沒有的較熱鬧的市街，它們使縣城孤零起來，冷落起來。筆者和縣長朱謨，副縣長劉碧光晤談了幾次。他們保持涪廣西行政官吏的樸實和誠懇，縣長，在過去，甚至在廣西以外的現在，還是「百里侯一，是所謂「父母官」，但朱縣長的月俸是桂幣一百五十元，（法幣七十五元）。雖然每年在田賦收入中，有政府規定縣長可得百分之一的酬金，但他畢竟是一個縣長，有許多少不了的支出和應酬，因此他現在還無法把湖北故鄉的眷屬迎來陽朔；現在縣政府每月辦公費僅二百元，單是燈油一項，就得費一百多元，使他必須限制縣府點燈的時問，時常可囑辦事員節省紙筆來平衡收支，山此看來，我相信他生活的淸苦。陽朔全縣，山多村少，是個貧瘠的四等縣份，每年經常及臨時的平衡收支的十二萬元，最大的收入是田賦附加，其餘，田畝附加和土產稅佔十分之三，公產收入佔十分之一，行政費和敎育費各佔全支出上分之三·七，現有縣立中學一所，中心小學上四所，初級基礎小學一百六十餘所。據朱縣長說：全縣已沒有失學的學齡兒童，成人敎育也在積極推進，文盲已减低到最少的數字，比較上，女性的文盲扔較男性爲多，原因是廣西女子的操作時間較男子爲長，至於僻處深山窮谷間約村婦，在推行和接受敎育的雙方面，更多不便，但概括地來說。文盲也可說是肅淸了。全縣出征人共一千餘人，尙有三十歲以內的後備壯一萬七千餘人，叫十歲以內的三萬人，都受過各鄕村長的督練，知道谷種基本戰術。劉副縣長是日本士官學校的畢業生，頭髮已經花白，仍不失少壯軍人的氣概。我看見他冒着雨在公共體育塲對六個連的集訓，遊擊隊講話。那些遊擊隊員是由各村推派的，每村五人，他們自備槍枝。子彈。服裝。並且自備伙食，到縣裹來受一個月的遊擊戰術訓練，然後再把所學得的帶回去，傳授給其他受過普通軍事訓練的壯丁。常劉副縣長領着我參觀他們的宿合時我覺得他們相處如同家人。最使我驚佩的，是陽朔縣現在巳具傭了若干處遊擊戰的根據地，那些工事，便是在這兩位縣長指導之下，與民衆合作完成的。</p>
<p>如鹵江山　筆者沒有過多的時間泛舟欣賞灕江，只能策杖作近郊的盤玩。廣西省原有把陽朔闢成風景區的計劃，陽朔縣也設有管理和建設風景區的組織，實際上，陽朔的風景是無須再事「建設」的，所謂建設，只要在山崖水灣稍微做一些亭台之類的點綴罷了。朱縣長就仟後，鑒於省縣都無餘款來進行一切，正擬廣請海內外名人捐款興築，即以其名名其建築物，以誌紀念。但蘆溝橋事　發，這件事只能延擱到勝利以後再進行了。市街以西，公路以東的谷地上，盆景似的矗立着高的二百尺的仙人山和獨秀峯。在道兩座奇峯的週圍，陽朔公園的雛形巳經完成。仙人山周圍僅數百步，山麓有可以穿越的岩洞和可以憑眺的「觀溪台一。從陡峻　曲石級上山，過半有亭曰「會仙」，大概是因爲適對着一條裂開的人形山石的緣故。山頂不到兩方丈，有亭名「萃英」，可以縱覽全城景物。近在咫尺的公路，柔媚地蜿蜒沒入馬鞍山的狹谷，遠處，灕江的流水靜靜地映着起伏的山影，對面，幾頭山烏，帶着遺世獨立的神氣，飛憇在無法攀登的獨秀峯上。眞是如畫的江山。碧蓮洞是陽朔最大的山石洞，鐘乳纍纍，深黝宏大。北口經正在陽朔休養的宋哲元氏雇石工修整，並於洞壁鐫「衆善咸集」四字，可容數百人躱避空襲，沿灕江的景色比較明朗開豁，有上依危崖，下臨急流的小石道向南起伏。北來的江水在此折轉，和石岸相撞，成無數漩渦，泛出一片片的白沫，隨着流水直到「泡水渡」口，才慢慢的破滅。有人在崖石上大書着一個「帶」字，確是灕水掠過陽朔的傳神描摩。</p>
<p>訪宋哲元　過去，站在馬鞍山的谷口，可以望見灕水的西岸，有一大片蔗田和一家土製蔗糖的榨坊，現在蔗田的一部分被新的竹籬包圍了，在幾棵高高的棕樹下，三間式的平房分散的在田土上建造起來，那是「進德新邨」，陽朔每一位居民都知道那是宋上將哲元的別墅。走進籬門，繞過一列屏風似的修竹，是小小的會堂，兩旁是傳達室和汽車間，路一灣，就見一個掛着匣槍，握着二十九軍的著名大刀的侍衛，他把我的名片交給宋氏的秘書主任高子厚氏，而隨卽延兌。宋氏自結束第一戰區副司令長官任務後，曾在南嶽休養若干時日，去年下半年，爲愛陽朔的山水，特在此購地建屋。現在正患輕性的半身不遂症，只能勉强在庭園裹散步。眷屬看　着他，代他婉謝來訪的賓客。高主任是一個謹嚴的山東人，曾任察哈爾省政府秘書長等職，相談甚懽，他們居信北方久了的人，在這已連月不見日光的陽朔山中，潮濕的氣候使他們感到不慣，但晨夕徜徉山水，在戒馬倥惚之餘，却也不無清趣·據高主仟說：「宋氏最近在陽朔就任軍事委員會委員職，已電蔣委員長請假，一俟病體復原，即赴渝到會辦事。這裹除宋夫人，男女公子和秘書辦事員若干人外，尙有衛隊六十餘人，宋氏有時也親臨講話，希望部下蔚爲國用，宋氏現服中藥，預計冉休養一月，當可呼籲世１　宋氏再晨八時起身，晚十時許休息，日常生活是寫字，讀經和散步。」新邨佔地的三十餘畝，購地所費的一千餘元，宋氏雖不能長住陽朔，但房屋構造仍極堅固，每幢的費洋千餘元，將來他準備把這新邨交給縣政府作爲地方的產業。宋氏今年五十六歲，在高主任送我出邨時，我瞥見他穿着便裝，握着手杖，和夫人女公子在院落裏閒談，氣色很好。宋氏對抗戰前途非常樂觀，他認吳佩孚决不會受人愚弄。（未完）</p>

<p>、異常危險、旋鳴回聲避讓、不料右面叉有日小型運輸艦一艘、船頭向西岸、船梢向東、橫在江中、致不能向右避讓、急行停車、但日艦依然直駛而下、瑞和輪將船頭向右檔略移、日艦乃在左邊駛過、該艦兩邊置有砲位、砲身</p>
<p>露出艦身</p>

<h3>日機轟炸外國產業　經引起嚴重詰難</h3>
<p>西報記者紛紛提出質問　日方代表一味游移其詞</p>
<p>大陸報云、日方昨（十七日）晚招待記者席上、各記者紛起質問日機襲擊南昌與平江事、日方發言人答稱、毘鄰華軍機關之建築物上所置之外國旗幟與標記、並無價値、縱有亦殊微細、某記者詢發言人能吾供給襲擊平江之詳報、至是乃開始關於日機師轟炸外國產業之</p>
<p>長時間討論</p>
<p>發言人答稱、吾人未續得詳報、陸軍發言人缺席、渠不知星期三日被炸之美以美敎會學校附近是吾有華軍機關、某記者詢日本空軍偵察員在平江曾吾發現標有旗幟或標記之某種英軍產業、發言人答、渠未得星期三日空襲時曾轟炸外國產業之消息、故此一問題不成立、作此質問之記者復稱、非詢是否</p>
<p>有外國產業</p>
<p>被炸、僅問臼當局是吾知悉平江之外國產業、發言人答稱。無消息、復答覆另一詰問云、日方陸海軍當局於開始攻擊前、先查閱外國領事館當局所供給之地圖、惟此等地圖、不甚詳盡、故日方曾一再請外國當局供給關於外國產業所在地之詳細情報、某記者詢、日當局會數度聲明被摧毀之產業、未予淸晰標明、則外國產業</p>
<p>將如何標明</p>
<p>之、始可不遭轟炸乎、發言人答稱、此事須加調查、氣候狀况、大有不同、某記者詢、日方三度空襲、何故將明白標明之美國產業三處均加破壞乎、發言人答、華軍常在外國產業附近設軍事機關、並謂漢口中央銀行大厦之下、闢有蔣介石將軍之防空室、某記者詢、</p>
<p>蔣介石將軍</p>
<p>乃軍事目標乎、又詢、平江英國敎會產業附近有任何軍事目標乎、發言人答稱、平江外國產業、旣未聞有破壞者、則此等問題、不必談論云、某記者詢、宜昌有美國產業四處、被炸者竟有三處、此乃特殊之例證、吾人頗欲得其詳、發言人答、吾人未得充份之情報、惟有此可能、即高射砲火逼日機高飛是、某記者詢、日方非前稱空襲宜昌、</p>
<p>未遇高射砲</p>
<p>乎、發言人答首次如是、其他數次空襲時、日機會被高射砲轟擊、某記者云、一次空襲中、美國產業爲十七枚炸彈所擊中、其中四枚、幾擊中長達二十呎之美國旗幟、發言人答、此事果屬實、則須加調查、該記者再度述及宜昌美國產業、</p>
<p>一次空襲中</p>
<p>被中十七彈事稱、此舉非不加區別而轟炸、即擲彈者技術低劣、發言人答覆其他詰問云、苟非天氣明郎、投彈未能準確、凡此種種、耐幹須加研究之問題、惟如上所述者、日本轟炸機之唯一目標、爲軍</p>
<h3>傅日方在租界內　　設便衣司令部</h3>
<p>租界當局嚴重注意　惟日方則極力否認</p>
<p>現代社云、據外人方面可靠消息、日方藉口防遏租界內發生恐怖事端、自與工部局成立協約後、即在漢口路某飯店內闢窒、組設便衣司令部、招聚大批浪人、從事偵查拘捕工作、事爲租界當局聞悉、當以日方此舉完全違法、核與所訂協的、亦無根據、顯屬妨碍租界行政、故向日方交涉取締、惟日本方面、則極力否認有組設便衣司令部事件、至於某飯店內所闢之室、完全以娛樂消遣爲目的、絕無其他作用云云、現租界當局、對此仍嚴重注意、並偵查其一切行動、</p>

<h3>傅程霖生　亦甘心作傀儡</h3>
<p>赴漢活動僞「市長」　偕地肥原悄然離滬</p>
<p>現代社云、本市地產商人程霖生、原係著名富賈、積資甚鉅、自一二八後、滬市地產事業失敗、程乃一落千丈、每况愈下、終至將麥特赫司脫路之私宅、亦一併變賣，遭遇頗爲悲慘、數年來度其艱苦生涯、已不復爲人所注意、茲據關係方面消息、程以境况蕭條、百無聊賴、故竟不顧節操、甘作傀儡、曾與偽組織方面密切往還、企圖出仟偽職、以爲發財之計、旋得陳孚木之吸引、與陰謀家土肥原相職、允畀以偽「漢口市長」之職、程受寵若驚、已於日前悄然偕土肥原陳孚木·離滬赴漢，從事活動、</p>
<p>日長期公債</p>
<p>數額驚人</p>
<p>一百六十九萬萬餘日元</p>
<p>大陸報云、日政府之長期公債、於上月底已達日金一六·九一四·七一九·〇〇〇元之數、較一月份增加二九留·三四四·〇〇〇元、除此等有息無期之借款而外、東京政府之短期公債以米劵之名發行者、達四六八·六一二·〇〇〇元、以絲券之名發出者、達七〇二五·〇〇〇元、二月杪日本之內債總額共達一五·六三五·〇〇四·〇〇〇元、較一月份增加三〇一·一六七·〇〇〇元、外債總額爲一·二七九·七一五·〇〇〇元、已减少三·七三三·〇〇〇元、內債之增加、大半因發行中國事變國庫公債與三厘半息國庫公債、以彌補軍費之不足而起、</p>
<h3>日軍當局　從容士兵姦殺</h3>
<p>不如是卽無法作戰　中國婦女慘遭蹂躪</p>
<p>大陸報云、今隨新四路軍之著名作家史沫特萊、撰文刊本週密勒氏評論週報、解釋日本士兵之在中國從事大屠殺、與姦淫刧掠、乃由若輩受軍官殘暴待遇所致、據史女士之文載稱、今已充份證明日軍高級司令故意使其士兵野蠻化、苟非如是、戰事即不能繼續進行、因一般</p>
<p>大半縈念</p>
<p>日兵其國內家庭中之貧困也、許多日本軍官率領並指揮其軍隊燒擄姦殺、如一閱奪獲之日軍書信與日記、允其在日記中可見日軍現巳逐步野蠻化矣、余今所在之南京與鎭江全區中之日兵唯一勾當、非屠殺人民即</p>
<p>追逐婦女</p>
<p>若謂日軍僅以中國妓女洩慾此實不確、蓋全中國之妓女、猶不足充滿僅上海虹口一隅中之日本妓院也、「皇軍慰安所」中之婦女、大多數爲被俘之女子、文明人士今日决不能視若無覩、而謂日軍所淫之婦女係娼妓、此言實屬不確、如日軍在此戰中獲勝、則今日中國婦女</p>
<p>所遭受者</p>
<p>他國婦女亦將遭受之、日軍之智識上與精神上之發展、幾與數百年前成吉斯汗之部衆相若、所差勝者唯區區虛表而已、事實上日軍今日在華作戰、頗效允當時野蠻之蒙古軍也、</p>
<p>三門灣日艦經</p>
<p>駐軍擊退</p>
<p>浙東沿海安謐　人口設法疏散三門灣健跳所洋面、十五日發現日艦三艘、先以機槍向岸上掃射、繼即放小艇一艘、載日兵十餘名、馳至寗海縣屬之貓頭山地方、企圖</p>
<p>強行登陸</p>
<p>搜索民間食糧及鷄猪羊等、嗣經該地駐軍及自衛團協力抗禦、登陸日兵、始乘原艇竄回艦上、該三艦業已他駛、該三門灣爲浙東之重要口岸之一、戰後禁止一切船隻駛入、由寗波防守司令部派有</p>
<p>重兵駐紮</p>
<p>、其沿海各口岸、已由寗波　台兩防守司令、築有鞏固之防禦工程、亦有重兵駐紮、嚴密戒備、甬江·椒江·甌江·鰲江，等均已封鎖、惟甬江及甌江爲</p>
<p>維持航行</p>
<p>計、仍准船隻駛入封鎖綫、沿海匪徒經兜剿後、漸將肅淸、惟浙東各地、時有日機發現、洋面時有日艦巡弋、因駐軍之戒備森嚴、日方之登陸企圖、决難得逞、各地依然安謐如常、海門等處人口、業已設法疏散、</p>
<h3>日破壞華北金融　應予直接報復</h3>
<p>法幣亦在外人財產之內　實行摧毀僞幣並非難事</p>
<p>日方漠視英美抗議之反響</p>
<p>大陸報云、華北實行名義上之廢除中國法幣、與一部份統制出口外滙、至今已一週矣、據華北傳來一切消息觀之、此等辦法、已遇先前性質相同的發展之同等結果、於貨幣方面、禁止法幣</p>
<p>顯已失敗</p>
<p>、蓋法幣非特並未跌價或絕跡於市、且於本週中用以易北平偽幣其升水續有增加、其他方面此對華北泰西商業所施的打擊之新辦法、暫巳成功、渤海各港口與靑島之歐美出口貿易、暫時已趨停頓、日偽方面甚至不准泰西商行違反新統制制度而履行前經的定之商業據路透社天津電訊所稱、可見此華北新經濟辦法、係由日本軍隊爲後盾、日兵在前德租界入口處拽查中外人士有吾携帶法幣、此舉乃蠻橫軍隊之</p>
<p>無禮行動</p>
<p>、完全侵犯泰西人民所享之條的上權利、領判權不僅應在法律上、且在事實上保護外人之財產、不問日方之願吾、即中國法幣亦在外人財產之內、在華許多泰西商人、對其本國當局未在華北向日軍對壘、深致遺憾、彼等大多欲知、爲不顧北平傀儡之命令、由泰西軍隊保護、在大津以外輪裝貨出口、並由外國砲艦護送、則將發生何種事故、當然整個事件尙未結束、英國下院對此巳發銳利之言辭、並與美國同向東京政府提出</p>
<p>正式抗議</p>
<p>矣、據日方報紙載稱、日方對此等抗議、將不予重視云云、但泰西民治國見其抗議之遭駁斥、必不致默然無言、諒將取某種報復也、但一般均望不直接向華北本身施報復、因此舉必使該地之外國利權受損失、且或將由日方間接操縱之、故必須向日本直接施報復、華北之新辦法、乃日方實行之泰西國家必須使日人感覺此等辦法爲</p>
<p>魯莽滅裂</p>
<p>而後已、華北之日偽經濟與貨幣立法、卒能成功與否、不獨與泰西國家之態度有關、大半須視華人而定、日軍所控制之華北各城中之華人、並不利用武力之直接方法，惟以不合作繼續作被動之抵抗、而漸使日方之努力失效、如華人方面予以合作、則今日法幣易偽幣、必不致　水、如華人繼續一致堅决不移、則華方銀行業之特殊機構、及其兌換店之衆多、頗可用以</p>
<p>繼續摧毀</p>
<p>北平偽幣也、友人某甫自華北返滬、一再令記者注意價格問題、渠切實聲明、日方鼓動實行新貨幣辦法、顯已忽視價格平準問題之嚴重性、須知一先令二便士合偽幣一元之價格、必須大事减削而後可、質言之、目下北平傀儡銀行掛牌之外滙價格、實較所應定者高出百分之六十左右、日人希望將能减低價格平準、但價格絕無减低之象、反在繼續上漲中、甚至在北平本身、傀儡當局、雖訂立無數官定價格之條例、但</p>
<p>不能停止</p>
<p>價格之繼續高漲、本週初、西貢米價格在北平躍至平均每包二十五元五角、華北出口物產、亦照偽幣流通額擴大之比率而價格激堆、各種入口貨物之價格亦增、蓋新貨幣辦法使入口受新障碍、並使舶來品短缺益甚也、北平偽銀行宜佈出售外滙、以償付入口貨物、但尙無外商爲私人來往而向其購買外滙者、偽銀行並訂立所謂具優先權之入口貨物表、先以外滙供給表中各貨、然後辦理其他貨物之外滙、表內所列、日軍軍用品</p>
<p>佔大多數</p>
<p>在此等情况中、華北新辦法實行後之第一週、並未鼓舞人心、此舉未能解决經濟與金融大問題、反使此等問題較前更不安定耳、</p>
<p>笱市來源暢旺</p>
<p>今年本市筍市、因來源稀少、致售價頗昂、旬日以來、天氣轉暖、貨物擁擠、市面已見降跌、現竹筍每百市斤售價十元至十一元、毛筍七元、以後市面隨天時之轉變爲轉移、</p>

<p>庽居楊樹浦杭州路平房之阜寗人竇有清（年二十四歲業馬路小工）、近娶同鄉名張二姑娘爲妻、夫婦間情感不洽、時生勃谿、上月二十一晨一時許（即廢歷元旦）、被人用斧砍斃、移屍無蹤、而妻張二姑娘向鄰居及自己生母張周氏僞稱其夫竇有清、在附近某茶肆啜茗、被某方拉去作工、</p>

<p>晨初每條（十兩）、賣方先喊二千〇八十五六元、而進者還價八十元、致雙方擯持至九時三刻、方始做開、首由現金號進錢兌業五十兩、二千〇八十二元爲開盤價、較上日做低二元、開後又進某掮客五十兩、爲八十一元、此後雖銀樓帮與某錢兌業傾向吐售、但因金號吸收亦力故爲狀頗平、逗留於八十元左右、金號進銀樓帮百兩、價八十元及八十一允、某掮客復進錢兌業五十兩、價八十兀、銀樓帮互做五十兩、八十一元、金號進銀樓帮五十兩、八十元、繼之某金號進錢兌業五十兩、價亦八十元、後父進錢兌業五十兩、價七十八元、此後金號止進旁觀、而售者更形殷切、故爲狀頓疲、而價亦立破入七十元關口、錢兌業互做五十兩六十九元、未幾又互做五十兩六十七元、此後因某金號又興買風、反動上昇、金號進錢兌業五十兩、六十九元、後又進錢兌業五十兩、七十五元爲午收價、午後因進者更缺、故重退入七十元關內、而交易僅錢兌業互做五十兩、二千〇六十六元爲晚收價、結果較之上日軋跌十八元、（巳連跌二天、共計三十元）、全天十六元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇七十五元、收進二千〇六十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>節金改小一元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至十一時〇七分、因烚赤潛勢頗疲、故亦掛小一元、大同行改懸二百十元、新同行爲二百〇八元、收進二百〇二元、</p>
<p>純金昨未更動</p>
<p>十七日倫敦電、英純金未更、每盎斯仍屬七鎊八先令六辨士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦仍爲一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金亦未更動、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦仍爲一千二百〇七元六角</p>
<p>外幣多數下跌</p>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美滙兌續降二五、本埠外滙市况、洋行結款尙盛、銀行供給暢旺、市價穩定、烚赤開盤軟弱、浮多拋塞頻仍、銀樓業亦時有供給、金號錢兌業等納胃未暢、一度猛烈下瀉、後金號錢兌業等、趁低吸納、漸呈穩定、下午交易凋零、浮多繼續出籠、進者寥寥、市價續疲、本週間津港帮購進甚少、因津埠滙水高漲關係、港埠金價巳落、亦難合算、外幣英美金鎊需要已稀、惟殷富搜購英金票、爲數頗鉅、外銀行吸收美金票亦吐、市價因烚赤虛弱、多數下降、坎拿大票、因軋坎美互滙趨升、公會交易稀少、僅承泰出長泰進美金票三百元、永泰出長泰進美金票二百元、昨日市價、英金鎊降三角五分、英金票降五分、美金鎊峰二角、美金票降二金鎊厘、法郞票升七毫半、安南票降一分、坎拿大票升九分、義大利票升半分、德金票降一分、澳金票降一角、其他各幣俱無更動、</p>
<p>貼現不動</p>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、突又趨平、每千元仍站於五十元左右、終爲五十元、與前日未有榮辱，</p>
<p>準備基金</p>
<p>分任資金</p>
<p>中英滙兌準備基金、由滙豐及中國銀行各出三百萬鎊、麥加利交通兩行各出兩百萬鎊、實行調節滙市、其人員亦即就各該行中選任一人、聞中交兩行之資金、出自海外存金云、</p>
<p>大條近遠俱降　銀銀平定逾恒</p>
<p>十七日倫敦電、大衆賣出、缺少維持、交易有限、市况平靜、收盤後繼續平定、大條銀近期猛縮三七五、遠期降一二五、紐的銀電、美現貨依然呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀平靜、現貨續降一安那、近遠期則未更改、</p>
<h3>津港雖買銀行則塞　外匯絕無變化</h3>
<p>英美匯兌昨再告下降　平衡稅猛跌二分二五</p>
<p>滙　市昨以外電香港曁天津幫及洋行等、雖相繼扒結、但因銀行頗肯塞出、故潛勢極形平稱、結果均未分軒輊、英美互匯連跌四天、毫無影響，牛天成交亦寥寥無幾、港滙因雙方供求勢均、故爲狀亦頗穩定、</p>
<p>晨　初以倫敦大條、近期縮三七五、遠期亦跌一二五、紐的銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金亦無升降、匯兌英對美降一厘九、對法長六生丁、對滬小一二五、美對英縮二五、對法跌一八七五、對滬降五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之前收、英美均平、開後雖港電與天津帮及洋行等互相扒結、但因銀行供塞尙殷、致爲狀甚鮮變幻、港電天津帮洋行結進匯豐華比某行英滙八便士二五、兼美匯十六元〇六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅褐曉猛跌二分二五計徵百分之六·二五、此後供求轉稀、僅略有銀行互做期貨買賣、於是狀態愈形穩定、外銀行購結某行（四月份）美滙十六元、將近午時、洋行又吸進外行安達港匯五十五元三七五、爲狀亦鮮變化、迨午收銀行賣價、英匯八便士二五、美滙十六元〇六二五、與晨開無異、結果較之前收、亦無上落、港滙亦平、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>津港滙市電訊</p>
<p>天津　十八日電、滙兌行市、與昨日相較、英滙縮〇三一二五、美滙縮〇六二五、申滙不動、茲將上午開盤市價列下、英滙七辨士六五六二五美滙十四元九三七五申匯　一〇七元（申交百元天津應收之數）</p>
<p>香港　十八日電、英美申滙兌行市、上午開盤、與十七日下午二時三十分價同、至十一時三十分均未有更動、茲將上午開盤市價列後、</p>
<p>英滙　一先令二辨士九〇六二五美滙　二十九元〇六二五申滙　一八〇元二五　（申滙爲港紙百元合上海法幣之數）</p>
<p>南北貸</p>
<p>靑岛生菓</p>
<p>亦被「統制」</p>
<p>靑島通訊、該處生仁生菓、復爲某方統制、如運至華中華南、俱須先向所謂「聯準銀行」所設之「外滙管理處」辦理匯兌賣出證明書、吾則海關不予放行、故產價轉升、生仁比本月初前後漲起一元八九角、中莊貨開十二元八角、由洋莊辦去一千六百包、大粒仁十三元八角、成交三千一百包、生菓漲起一元一二角、高密生十元五六角、王台生十元二角、成交三千二百包、查糖貨進口、咋一千二百二十包、由香港運來、又一千五百七十包、由汕頭來滬、</p>
<h3>紗花　實需稍動　綫價一漲十餘元</h3>
<p>二十支紗獨無榮譽</p>
<p>紗　市平靜、趨勢稍緊、因南華香港·汕頭兩幫需要略增、致人心堅昂、至於浙東方面、湘贛等處、對於夏季之細紗綫採辦應用、於是業中某戶、在市吸收允烈、關閉不售、市態較緊、做作更甚、因之漲風銳不可當、然查其實際交易、固然小弱、但同業買賣超過於客銷數倍也、此貨存底允缺、波瀾容易掀動、故二十支紗籌碼比較充盈、氣勢和緩耳、午後二十支紗市平平、惟綫價續趨昂騰、漲勢鋒銳、三二支飛漲十元以外、</p>
<p>現　紗情形、晨初開盤、市情尙平和、但綫以浙東帮探問較多、人心激昂、且大家拉緊不願脫售、市態更昂、開價二十支雙馬仍爲三百九十四元半、惟三二支綫價一跳十元、繼以細紗綫價漲勢甚熾、紗價帶好一步、迨至收幫仍屬平平、午後開盤、紗市仍平澹無特色、惟三二支綫價互相高抬、因溫州湖南稍有辦胃之故也、但廠方乘漲時開出綫幾百包、結果成交統計一千二百八十九包、行情三二支及四二支激漲五元至十五允、二十支紗無甚軒輊、廠方由振華廠開出十六支雙龍五十包、價爲三百二十五元、申新九廠開出三二支雙馬二百五十包、價爲五百五十元、新裕廠開出三二支地球一百五十包、價爲五百四十兀、均四月份出貨、今日有紗四十五件運天津、四百件運泉州、茲將各帮買去之額量列左、汕頭　三一〇　香港　一三〇　內地　四五寗波　七九　湖南　五五　雲南　一二〇溫州　一五〇　厦門　三〇　同行　七三〇統計　一二八九　日　紗市塲依然堅定、蓋北方天津陳情邇來布疋需要暢盛、故紗市帶起矣、二十支水月現紗價爲三百三十九元、到過四十元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十九元、到過三十兀外、收盤又買進云、</p>
<p>申請進印棉一千件</p>
<p>外　棉市價、紐的棉市異常恍惚、晨初因利物浦電告而下落、華盛頓方面傳出消息獎勵棉花出口津貼之計劃書、正在進行、傳農部建議政府即日放出貸款棉一百萬包、但詳情尙難探悉、據議員施密斯語人、對農部此項建議、將作堅决之反對云、昨日紐的近期漲三磅音、遠期跌二磅音、印度連同預測較漲一羅比、因歐洲時局之不寗、及美貸款棉之放出問題印度棉恐有小面也、埃及跌三磅音、昨日匯兌無甚軒輊、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西棉每担漲二角、印棉漲三角、埃及棉不動、</p>
<p>滬　市外棉交易、日來十支及廿支紗買賣較盛、故各廠所購之棉、多爲組紗原料、申新昨日又進印棉白洛區一千件、合送廠價爲七十五元半、日廠方面、因印棉水脚殊難派到、不敢冒險訂購、故日廠之訂購印棉、止辦已有多日、大衆目光巳轉移於美棉、唯在美貸款棉尙未放出前、購買美棉時有無貨之不便也、茲將昨日棉價分列於後、</p>
<h3>通花漲達八十元</h3>
<p>本　棉生意較少、額量雖稀、筆數甚繁、華日各廠隻包未辦、實綠價格太高、且日見漲無止境、總之各方產區存貨雖未斷絕、然運輸受阻、來源缺乏、故市價節節前進、新高價層見疊出、通州花叉現高峰價爲八十元、比上日再漲一元、火機芥維持原價、蘇北到貨、通州花僅二百六十八包、今日出口有機棉花二百件運寗波、七十件運香港、昨進口姚花、有四千六百八十件、由寗波運來、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<p>大馬口鐵</p>
<p>售盤猛晉</p>
<p>大馬口鐵自天津帮及某機關等大量在收後、標準猛漲、查海外同業定貨雖屬不少、但行情却突飛猛晋、如二十四號定價每箱四鎊八先令六辨士、二十六號每箱三鎊十先令、（皆德貨）、均比前漲五先令之多、查係遠期貨、殊不能供給本埠近期需耍、故市氣益挺最近售盤二十四號每箱沽一百四十五元、較前漲起五元、二十六號每箱售一百三十元、比前亦好起四元、而本街如紗廠·玩具廠·及客帮等銷路甚暢、查前昨兩日共銷去有百餘箱之多云、印報紙亦有到滬</p>
<p>進出口</p>
<p>茶葉烟葉來滬不少</p>
<p>印報紙亦有滬</p>
<p>昨日進口貨物、有茶葉一百二十件、由寗波運來、烟葉四十件亦由寗波來滬、烟葉一千一百噸、由紐的運來、又二百五十件、由溫州來、鮮蛋四百八十五件寗波來、士紙一萬四千五百七十件、溫州來、又五千八百件、寗波來、印報紙三百六十九件、紐的來、</p>
<p>海味</p>
<p>生粉街銷盛</p>
<p>生粉此問底存旣薄、而本街辦胃叉濃、於是售盤再見挺進、刻市飛麒麟標爲十六元五角、三×標十六元、人槍標十八元四角、各標升三四角不一、</p>

<h3>證券　歐陸風雲</h3>
<p>英商遠東股票連跌內債行市亦形不安</p>
<p>證　劵暗盤、昨日市况仍在波動不已、未能寗靜、因歐洲風雲、又在醞釀、誠恐一旦有事、人心爲之不定、全日以四號始終買進爲最可注意、其背景亦俱屬大戶、同康亦始終吸收、五號則出丙戊而掉進甲種、當然另有打算、賣出方面、則頗不一致、上午有永康天生及中一賣出、下午有樂茂永康及散戶賣出、買戶零星者亦有五號四十二號及貿大、故市價在各帮取捨中、波動不已、上午初疲後漲、終則仍跌、下午初跌而復行回高、市價一日數變、足見人心之忐忑、結果續小五七角、趨勢混沌、殊難捉摸也、成交總數的計六十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股　票交易成交華商電氣股五十股、價爲五元四角二分半、倫　敦英商遠東各公司股票本有十七日（星期五）掛牌行市、因受歐局發展影響、續吿下跌、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股續跌一鎊、價爲八十六鎊、香港註冊股續跌二鎊、價爲八十四鎊、開平煤礦股續跌三便士、價爲十八先令、古拉客林傍橡皮股續跌一先令三便士、價爲十八先令九便士、惟麥加利銀行股微回二先令六便士、價爲八鎊十七先令六便士、餘無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外幣債券本月十七日（星期五）掛牌行市、中法美金五釐公債有印債票猛跌一鎊半、價爲六十七鎊半、　海鐵路公債有印債票則上升半鎊、價爲十六鎊半、共餘均無變動、英倫實貨供求、亦吿沉寂、</p>
<p>苦杏仁</p>
<p>天津限制出口　本市長漲不已</p>
<p>苦杏仁因天津限制出口、本月十日實行、故十日前裝出之貨、尙有運到、於是漲風甚熾、較高之貨、會開七十元至六十元、昨北貨行家到有五十餘件貨品較遜、但以六十五元開出三十餘件其餘堅持七十餘元、方肯再開、</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>黃豆交易衰落</p>
<p>昨日黃豆銷塲特殊衰落、出口帮不動、祇本街略有問津、統市計成交浦東杜豆二十包、價爲十元、崇明沙黃二百包、八元四角五分、大連現豆一百六十包、八元四角三分、行囤回出四月份交二車、八元三角六及三角七、行市除沙黃跌去五分外、共餘小挫一二分云、</p>
<p>今日有豆子一千三百四十包運泉州</p>
<p>煤炭</p>
<p>白煤悄行情步低</p>
<p>白煤屑高檔各貨、開歲來突見充溢、目前某外輪又有鴻基屑五千噸大批裝到、而各廠胃納漸足、交易難見起色、致行情頓呈外强中乾之象、惟二號屑銷路尙暢、蓋煤球廠貧廉易售、日昨高决貨計共成交六百餘噸、開價一號屑每噸念八元、二號屑念二元、新鴻屑念一元五角、棧房出貨、行槓另加、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲再漲的索隱</h3>
<p>由於通貸膨脹這影響爲多　滬絲高漲爲日人絲拓銷場　又促成外銷絲市長期停閉</p>
<p>橫　濱絲市、前日再起猛烈漲風、現貨晨開一〇七〇元、漲三十五元、遠期一〇二五元、漲四十元、又創空前紀錄、按橫濱絲市在第一次激漲時、會爲橫濱當局取締投機、飭令停拍、且據傳來消息、東市絲價會因或種規定、限止在一千元關內、是以日美絲價才轉跌風、至本月十一日橫濱曾跌至九六〇允、然七日來東市絲價父向上挺進、竟飛躍一一〇元、幾超出『規定』二〇〇元許、而並未聞受若何干涉、是故此種漲風、上海絲市、因有如是之了解、即日絲漲風受限止於前、而得放任於後、當由於日本幣制價値問題所造成、囤購貨物掀起投機風潮、係因最近日本藏相提及决擬實施通貨膨脹所致、此種漲風祇在日本國內較有價値、在世界市塲上、尙須通過　率關係、而减低其激漲之影響此其一、最近橫濱絲價雖形激漲、但現貨及近遠各期、騰漲甚不一律、且聞亦有現貨漲而同時遠期跌、此點當係週前絲價下落時、種下了補空回漲之原因、此外紐的現貨枯薄、（二月底存絲减少一萬擔）需要較覺迫切、而三月份生絲輸美到貨遲緩、形成爭購現貨局勢、此其二、故此决漲風、可推知由於消費者之支持者少、由於其他特殊原因者多、與上决漲風之性質、並無軒輊、</p>
<p>紐　的絲市前日漲風亦熾、近期漲三分半、遠期漲五分、現貨日絲各漲七分、上海絲廣東絲漲五分、尙未超過前决最高紀錄（尙差二分許）、復因邇來滙率放長、上海絲美市合價、仍在一七〇〇兀、故木埠外銷、尙難接近、</p>
<p>本　埠絲市、在此次國外絲價猛烈騰漲中、顯見得沒有前决熱烈、人心猶豫、仍鮮進出、蓋上决本埠絲價之過度高漲、在突轉跌風之後、直至現在、尙未受盡其惡果影響、如綢廠之改用人造絲代眞絲、巳有百分之六十、誠爲非常嚴重之問題、蓋藉此可知國內絲價之過度騰　、（與實銷分道揚鑣之騰漲）不僅使生絲斷絕了內銷的出路、客觀上更替大批日本人造絲開闢了廣大市塲、這便是直接損虧了抗戰的基金、增加了法西斯侵略的資本、此其一、第二外銷絲市之長期停閉、也促使絲銷呆滯、促使絲價失去有力的支持、這不僅使投機家自食其果、也帶上整個絲業跑上了陷阱甚多的道路、如此等等、已足够證實本刊前載「最近絲價爲什麼會過度騰漲」一文中之結論、卽「受到這種騰漲的壓力的、還是自己人」一語、實誠堪痛惜者、</p>
<p>書至此、作者願冉提出這個問題、誠懇請絲業界接受這絲價過度上騰之敎訓、以免冉蹈覆轍、（揚）</p>

<p>客秈產地來電禁遠　行情跳二三角</p>
<p>客　秈咋得南京蕪湖來電、該地禁止出口、存米不克盡量付裝因此貨主又見居奇扳倘、不肯賤脫、行情頓時跳漲二三角、蕪秈又開至十三元、南京高秈則至十三元一二角、中次一致帶起、</p>
<p>洋　米定價　昂、人心又被本客秈價漲帶好、現洋米一號西貢立漲一二角、售開三四百包、價十七元二角至十七元一角半、十七元一角不等、目下市價步高、米商又注神於定貨、但暫時尙難通運、即報載甬紹定訂、亦未經證實云、</p>
<p>國　米來源、自經常錫等地某方禁發搬運證後、突見轉稀、雖河下到有十七八號、而車運包子祗一二千包、市上人心因復向榮、囤戶大都拉進、本街亦隨活動、售方遂乘機喊高、市面即呈帶緊、結果厚薄粳價回上一二角、杜洋尖埠尖亦好角許、變元則以價格已高、無榮辱、</p>
<p>今日有麫粉八千五百包運犬津、二百包運寗波、四千四百包運福州、一萬二千四百包運泉州、</p>

<p>昨日油餅市况、因値週末、且因連市報價、無甚出入、故趨勢和平、昨計做開膠州生油十件、價爲三十一元原盤、大連現豆油一百桶、三十二元零五分、及一角五分、七天交五十桶、三十一元九角、三月下交一百桶、三十一元八角及八角半、四月份交五百桶、三十一元八角五分至三十一元九角半、</p>
<p>豆餅祇五月份大連餅開五千片、價爲三元一角五分、</p>

<h3>疋頭　春夏貸　銷路日盛</h3>
<p>白襯絨存貨售罄　東疋細布染銷旺</p>
<p>國　布因今年短春，氣候早熱、本街及近地各幫、春夏貨動銷亦格外提早、故春夏貨需要允爲廣泛、且受漂煉廠缺乏之限制、供求苦難適應、昨因西南川滇粤帮實銷漸有起色、進漂白印花貨外、元灰秋香色斜紋藍布亦添辦四五千疋、故坯布售盤、驟見提高一角至二角半、本街對於深淺色布銷路繁盛、每疋亦提漲二角左右、白貨細斜粗布、廠盤雖堅、惟質際去化平庸、依然疲弱、細布以永安廠大鵬牌最俏、現貨搜購一殊難、富貴細布提漲五分餘、各廠出品、因實銷不振、回漲無力、粤帮購富貴愛字細布·細斜一百餘件、浙贛帮辦各牌細布細斜一百二三十包、本街門市春銷吒動、當令貨洋紗府綢漂布淺色布購辦甚殷、白襯絨去年存貨售罄、各廠殊尠出品、市盤在增、怡和襯絨漲價全每碼四角五分、紅盤時祇三角七分半、</p>
<p>東　疋細布·細斜、因本街染銷續旺、昨現期貸交易達一千五六百件之鉅、市氣激昂、每疋猛漲一角半至二角、各洋行訂開下月份細布期貨、亦有千餘件、細斜索價過高、致難接近、十二磅龍頭細布四月期十二元一角半、五福喇叭每疋爲十二兀一角、開額以飛魚細布最多、計七百餘件每疋價自十二元二角至十二元二角牛、</p>
<p>今　日疋關出口、二百十件運天津、七件運廈門、二百件運泉州、六百七十仆運寗波、</p>

<h3>女職員的生活</h3>
<p>— 海嘯</p>
<p>在失業浪潮澎湃的現在，婦女職業中的女職員，確是佔着很主要的一個職業部分，在目前畸形繁榮的上海，雖然沒有正確的統計過女職員的總數，但以的略的估計，我想起碼也在十萬左右呢！大半是在資本較小的百貨商店裏，不過在這裏作者所能知道而欲報道的，還是在規模較大的百貨公司。現在先來談談她們的待遇吧</p>
<p>女職員的待遇，也許在人們的想象中是很富裕的，她們藏身在高聳雲際的大厦中，豪華的點綴裹，在峭寒的冬天，有着熱水汀的暖意，在炎熱的夏天，也有冷氣的凉意，她們的服裝也是應時摩登的：燙着飛機式的鬆髮，穿的也多是閣閣閣的高跟皮鞋，的確，在外貌瞧起來，誰都以爲在大公司裏做女職員的是多麼闊綽啊！俸給是相當可觀呢！但事實却在我們的意想之外，他們正有訴不盡的苦處呢！</p>
<p>我曾聽到過一個女職員的怨聲：「吃公司飯，等於坐長期的自由監牢」！從這句的怨聲裏，我們已很可體味出她們的培遇了。</p>
<p>每天的營業時間，普通都是從上午九點到下午八點纔打烊，鎭天除進餐的時間外，幾乎要十小時，呆板地看守着（也許便是女職員眼中監獄鐵柵）「貨櫃」。在空閒的時候，也不能溜出一息時候的，因爲顧客隨時會光臨，要是，恰巧你不在時，那要當心上級主任的「排頭一，除非你在平常吹拍有方，上級是不會原諒的。所以在每天空閒得厭極的時候，你也得守住自己的崗位，只能在貨櫃的圈圍中，像白熊般的踱來踱去，死待着顧客，腿子酸倦時你也不能多坐冷板櫈，因爲你得更留心大闆和經理的偶然巡視。</p>
<p>每天最忙的時候，大槪都在三四時前後，當在顧客蜂擁的時候，你的手腦便得都要敏捷，不慌張，不緩慢，不然一日算錯了銀錢，就得照價吃賠賬，是義不容辭的職責，要是手脚慢了些，就是上級的「排頭一僥倖中錯過了，但顧客的「排頭也許　是免不了的。</p>
<p>招待顧客，是需要殷勤周到，堆着滿臉的迎笑；柔聲和氣地，這樣才能使顧客的鈔票，吸引到你的手裏，再轉到老闆的袋裏，要是你招待顧客，老是板板六十四地打一句走一步，問一句答一句，那老實講：你是不合格做個老闆的生意眼中底理想女職員。</p>
<p>顧客的上櫃檯，往往不是都會成交的，有嫌價格太貴而買不起的，也有招待不周而不買的，但還有另一種故意不買而尋閒事的顧客，也便是每個女職員所感到最棘手的一種顧客。看他們穿的也有筆挺的洋裝，熌亮的皮鞋，眼鏡，像煞有介事地走上來，要你拿東拿西，這　不好，那樣父不好，眼睛像老鼠似的斜來斜去，一邊還和你嚕囌地搭訕，纏擾了好久，　老着臉皮溜跑了。道種是什麽顧客呢？老實講就是上海的一般胡調朋友，是每個女職員經常會遭受到的侮辱。在這些胡調朋友的口中，女職員的名詞，也給代替了什麽「花瓶」，這是何等汚辱啊！是何等的惡意啊！</p>
<p>不過在一般的年靑顧客底心理，對於女職員的招待，似乎比男職員來得好感，吸引力較大，因此女職員在無形中，也變成了一般聰明商人，所利用的一種廣吿了。（明日續完）</p>

<p>前吳縣圖書館館長某耆宿，鑒於故鄉淪陷後，有一部份民衆被人麻醉，而認賊作父，願做傀儡，故將以前之民族英雄事略叙出，而撰成開篇，請彈詞家有便播諸絃索，俾聽衆知所崇拜，語重心長，値得提倡；目所叙事略，概用白話，得以普遍宣傳，爰錄兩則如下，諒亦愛國同胞所樂聞也。</p>
<p>（一）史可法</p>
<p>史可法先生，是河南省祥符縣地方人，他的號呻憲之，又呌道鄰。明朝崇禎時候的進士，他的官做到兵部尙書。自從李闖打進北京，崇禎帝弔死在煤山上，史先生哭暈了幾回，就起兵渡過江去，預備抵抗滿淸。那馬士英阮大鋮一班人，拿武力來擁護福王，恨史先生的忠直，封他做太子太保兵部尙書，派到揚州去督師，做那淮北泗水臨淮廬州的總兵，使他左右牽制。滿淸攝政王多爾袞，寫信勸他投降，史先生覆信去謝絕，後來淸兵圍困揚州，隔了五天，揚州城破了，史先生被他捉住，不肯屈服，就被淸兵殺死，滿淸恨史先生，並恨揚州的百姓，派兵來屠殺了十天，等到南京城破，福王逃走，揚州的百姓紀念史先生，把他的衣冠，葬在天寗寺門外的梅花嶺上頭，你們想史先生的人，不是十分可敬麼！</p>
<p>萬點寒梅帶血開，史督師柱石中原大將材。試看十日屠城記，痛煞揚州遭刼灰。想當年，崇禎皇帝登基後，一班朝士盡庸騃。貪官汚吏多多少，自古道武官要性命，文官要錢財。一朝逆闖興兵起，攻陷京畿實可危。兵窮餉絕無人問，不管那景陽宮鏑撞幾回。可憐那，思宗縊死煤山上，地坼天崩大舉哀。史閣部聞變號啕哭，勤王兵尅日渡江來。民族英雄齊奮起，聲聲鼙鼓像轟雷。可恨那，馬士英，阮大鋮一班奸黨爭權利，擁立福王釀禍胎。又有那，吳三桂把淸兵借，開門揖盜的大罪魁。弄得他，英雄幾無用武地，史可法束手困重圍。天明江山從此去，多少忠臣義士殉泉台。至今上丈梅花嶺，毅魄英魂終古埋，天寗門外幾徘徊。</p>
<h3>「書生有用論」</h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>「百無一用是書生，」文化人的「無用，」可見不是現在如此。「人生識字胡塗始，」因此，「字」實在「識」不得，道是「百無一用是書生」的明確的註解。「胡塗」人的「百無一用，」這是誰都曉得的。</p>
<p>現在是抗戰的時候，「投筆從戎，」是爲大家所敬佩，這可是「筆杆子」究竟是不及「槍杆子」的又一個明證。因此有些人對「文化人」在報章雜誌上大發議論，不禁輕視曰：「有種氣到前綫去，住在後方嘮嘮叨叨，這是口頭抗戰，這是文化人的墮落！」因此「書生」仍是「百無一用，」不過語氣是改變過來了。</p>
<p>然而「書生」果眞是「無用」麽？我說是「是的，」也是「不是的。」這話不是矛盾了麼？其實世界萬物，都是矛盾的。有其「善」的一面，必也有其「惡」的一面。「書生」有「無用」的，然而不能抹殺，也有「有用」的。吾則，魯迅先生好好在學醫生，爲什麽要棄醫而從事於文藝的工作呢？單以我手頭間的一本巧爾尼雪夫斯基的小說「何爲，」據說是十九世紀舊俄時代靑年男女的一個「天啟。」這只是在文藝一方面，其他如社會科學，亦莫不爲然。</p>
<p>採殺文化人的無用，輕視「筆杆子」而重視「槍杆子，」這種人可說是只生了一隻眼睛，而對世界萬物，也只看見了一面，實有糾正的必要。</p>
<p>其實，文化人也有「無用」的，在他的筆底下，所寫出來的，非唯與國家社會無益，而反而有害，這可說是超　「無用」之上了。還有一種「書獃子，」捧着書本子死讀，咬文嚼字，一派「書生氣。」「人生識字胡塗　，」這句話來給他們，實在是再也得當也沒有的了。因爲道種人，只見書本子上的「敎條，」而不見書平子之外的動亂的世界。把「敎條」來衡量動亂的世界，因此他的眼睛瞇糊起來了，覺得實　有點「胡塗。」冬烘先生從孔孟的學說上來一現代的婦女，他一定會「胡塗，」也一定會「憂患始，」不覺要搖頭教息：「世道日下」了。</p>
<p>像那樣的「文化人，」可說是「百無一用」的了。而抗戰對於那樣的「文化人，」我想是不必從他們那邊去求得一點什麼幫助的。然而，這只是「惡」的一方面，而從這「惡」的一方面去抹殺一切文化人的戰鬥性，這要不是「無知，」那末就是帶有點「惡意」了。</p>
<p>本月十五日的桂林電訊：說西南行營主任白崇禧將軍，十叫日招待文化界，席間發表演說，大意謂：「此决對日戰爭，其性質爲抗戰，爲應戰，吾人處於决殖民地地位，其爭勝方法，端賴全體性戰爭，在政治經濟文化各方面與敵奮鬥，文化人的工作，雖偏在後方，然其有助抗戰，决不亞於前方流血壯士。」文化人的「有用性」是從白將軍那裏司說是得到一個明證了。白將軍又指出，二期抗戰，我方在軍事方面取守勢，而在政治方面取攻勢。因此，這裹顯示出，文化人的筆杆子在健全國民的精神方面，可說是一種最爲優良的武器了。</p>
<p>我們不做「百無一用」的「書生，」我們也不爲識得字而「胡塗，」我們不聽人家的「妄言，」我們肩起我們的「筆杆子，「要發揮出我們的戰鬥的精神來，總之，我們是不亞於前方流血的壯士的「文化人！」</p>
<h3>「檀島血案」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>廿世紀福斯出品　大光明戲院開映</p>
<p>華納夏能壽終正寢以後，所謂「中國大伯探陳查禮」，也鬧了雙包案·一位是我們的「國貨」徐莘園先生，徐欣夫先生導演的「珍珠衫」，便是以「陳查禮回國第一次大血案」來宣傳的；還有一位便是這位薛尼托勒了，那是廿世紀福斯公司特地覓寳似的覓來作華納夏能的「承繼人」的。這兩位先生國籍面貌都各不同，不過化裝却是一致都是以華納夏能爲藍本，好像華納夏能即眞是所謂一中國大偵探陳查禮」似的。</p>
<p>徐莘園的陳查禮我們看過了，按下不提。那位薛尼托勒先生呢？他的作風是吾和他的化裝一樣，是繼承着華納夏能的一貫作風呢？</p>
<p>回答說：是的，可是也不是。這怎麼說呢？是的是他很想學華納夏能那種遲鈍緩慢的動作和發音；（這是中國人的特徵嗎？錯了！）不是提他究竟不是華納夏能，所以一切動亻和發音都較華納能來得快，但也因之失去了夏能的那樣的深沉，在我們中國人自己來看，就覺得更不像了。</p>
<p>「檀島血案」的開塲是以陳查　家的合家歡開始的，以他的大女兒即將生產始，也以他的大女兒生了一個男孩子終，中間則揷入一件「血案」。陳查禮探案以它的戲名及脚色按排來看，本來早巳注定是「連台好戲」了，現在介紹了他的令郞令嬡以及太太女婿，並以他私人的事件作爲開始和終結，看光景，是頗有爲陳查禮立傳趨向的。自然，這得以「生意眼」爲依歸，如有生意，那麼「小陳查禮出世」也未始不可來一個劇本，因爲在「檀島血案」中，叉有了二個夙有父志的令郞了也。</p>
<p>「檀島血案」的背景是在船上，所以這血案發生地的火奴魯魯的特點是沒有的；全戲除以「偵探」爲骨幹之外，在穿揷中，則有了點恐怖怪誕的成份，如那個帝人腦的卡迪根博士，關在籠子裹的野獸及養獅的船伙等。</p>
<p>劇本編製和導演手法都未見得如何高强，偵探片的疑陣是有一些的，（如對那個多少有點怪誕的卡迪根博士，不過以老看偵探片的經騐，使我們知道，越是在疑陣中的人物，越不會是兇手，因之對卡迪根，也使我們减低了興趣了。）然而破案的綫索則沒有，直待暗中攝影，再由陳查禮來說明一下，這是不够的。</p>
<p>飾查禮决子詹美的孫揚（Sen　Ynng，除了彈眼睛之外，沒有別的戲，他的一面孔恐怖，和乃父查禮先生的作風是相反的；倒還是查禮先生的第五令郞，人雖小，戲倒還顯得自然一點。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　叙友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>何雙玉道：「現在這三個小孩子還在嗎？』朱愛人道：『自然還在，我們是特別看護。生出來的時候，雖然比較別的嬰兒，略小一點，但也有五磅半至五磅又四分之三。難爲那個母親的肚皮，怎樣的裝得下呢？這三胞胎生下以後，報紙上一登載，便鬨動了許多人，耍來觀看。後來經我們一概謝絕了，不讓人家來參觀，你想倘然一天到晚，讓人家來參觀是，多們麻煩，而且於嬰兒又不相宜。其實也沒有什麽可觀，不過一向習慣上，是一人生一人的，這回她是一人生了三人了。這三人也和尋常人一樣，並不多）隻手和一條腿呢。但是人類總是好奇心重，有和章翳師認識和我認識的，都要求看看這三個孩子。在不妨碍他們的條件下，也只得引領人家去看看，因此贈給這小孩子的東西，倒不少呀！」何儷玉道：『你不要說人家好奇心，我就想去看看。現在這三個孩子在那裹？是幾時生的？此刻有多大了？』朱愛人道：『初生的時候，原是在我們醫院裹的。到滿了月以後，本該母子都可以回去了。但是那位方警官的夫人，產後身體就不大好，要敎她一個人撫育三個孩子，如何吃得消。不但是要她奶孩子了，就是不給他們奶吃，單是看護，也就很辛苦了。而且他們家裹，也沒有這餘力，雇用乳母以及看護人等，這時地方上，以爲一胎三兒。出於異數，村自治會願意每年補助撫育的費用。我們老章醫師，也以爲這一胎三兒，恰恰是出於我們醫院裏。而我們醫院裏看護盡力，母子皆安，也是我們醫院的榮譽。倘然方警官夫婦，肯交給我們醫院裹撫育的，好在我們這裏有育嬰院，我們願盡義務。後來議决是村自治會補助一半，我們的育嬰院盡一半義務。現在那三個孩子，巳經十八個月了。路也會走了，話也會說了，非常活潑可愛，人人見了，都喜歡他們。他們的父母，每月來看他們一次兩决，起初覺得自己生的孩子，現在近於公育了，那孩子好像不屬於自己的一般。後來我們章醫師開導他們，孩子終究是你們的孩子，爲了你們免於麻煩，我們代爲撫育罷了。』（六四）</p>

<h3>長征川滇的流亡的藝人　王獻齋回滬訪問記</h3>
<p>— 辛士</p>
<p>前　歲長征入川，從事演劇宜傳工作的「上海影人劇團」領導者王獻齋君，在飽嘗苦難，歷經蓉，渝，雲，貴各地，度着一年有半的流亡生活之下，最近業已安然北返，重回孤島來了。前天和他握手言歡、互訴別離情况、彼此深喜故人無恙，不禁同具恍如隔世之感。王先生負名銀壇近二十年是一位慣狀陰險人物在每個觀衆腦海裏都早鐫有深刻印象的獨以演技精湛見稱的優特藝人。關於他的旅途情况，當然也是每個電影觀衆都很予關懷的。他所領導的劇團旅况，我們在一月以前，曾有「孫敏從昆明歸來」一文，早經記述過了，因此這裹所要寫的訪談情形，祗是王先生所述一些感想和共他談片。</p>
<p>友派角色到處吃虧</p>
<p>「上海影人劇團」在前年十月間到了重慶以後，所有團方一切對外事宜，差不多都由他一人出任周旋。因爲在四川方面，明星公司的片子向來映得最多；只有他和龔稼農是最爲人所熟知的老角色；餘如白楊女士等一般新人，在當地人目光中大槪都還很覺生疏。所以，爲了接洽便利起見，他也只能義不容辭地担任領導名義，而這樣多做一些工作了。但又爲他在銀幕上常演反派爲色，四川人都眞當他是一位「十惡不赦」的奸詐人物關係，有時不免顧忌多端，使他遇事掣肘反覺難辦。他在又氣又覺好笑的情形之下，自己也認爲其在銀慕上作惡多端的應得報應。因此在辦事上處處受累不少，眞是一個絕大的笑話。</p>
<p>發生意見劇團分化</p>
<p>大隊影人們，此次在出征川蜀之初，大家懷着一腔熱烈的情緒，只圖各盡天職，誰都沒有分毫的名利觀念。所以團中人上自主角，下至工役；全都甘苦相共，待遇絕無等級。大家最初的願望，也只全在維持最低限度的生活。及後出演結果，售座奇旺，除去了一切開銷以外，天家在一月間居然還有一百多元的餘利可派，更覺喜出望外，愈感興奮。但在重慶演畢，轉上成都；因爲表演救亡劇「流民三千萬」竟會越出常情，引起當地官廳，發生誤會，至於多出一番麻煩之後，劇團內部便發生意見，分成了兩個組織。白楊，沈浮等二十餘人，改組爲「成都劇團」。王獻齋及孫敏，龔稼農，馬瘦紅，袁竹如，朱曼華等男女七人一體退出，另組「沙利文劇團」。兩下同在成都，繼續表演，漸决多演職業化的戲劇。這樣演過了兩個多月，叉在那裏休息了不少時候；他們這一個七小劇團，才於去年冬初，再作昆明之行。「成都劇團」方面，除白楊等幾位旋即加入中央攝影塲服務外，所有大部份的劇員們，後來又與「業餘劇團」合併，在作長期公演。</p>
<p>袁竹如旅途結良緣</p>
<p>女團員袁竹如小姐，和他原是明星公司的舊同事。此决在萬里征程的危難期中，彼此沿途照拂，同感情投合，漸决心心相印地趨上了戀愛之途。袁小姐端莊靜穆，旣是雲英未嫁的少女；他亦是位斷絃未續，「守節」了十三年的老鰥夫。因此「良緣天合」在去年一月十五那天，便在成都演出了一番結婚喜劇，當時大宴羣賓，情形且極熱鬧，袁小姐籍隸雲南昆明，後來到了那裏，並曾同返故鄉去爲她父母掃墓祭奠，也算盡了一點孝心。最近，賢伉儷同回上海之後，電影界許多朋友們，都爲慶得佳偶，並向他們紛紛討吃喜酒；他們也經準備定期設宴了，惟在現環境，絕對不作任何鋪張。</p>
<p>遊藝界鄉訊動歸思</p>
<p>從成都到了昆明，在那裏新滇劇院上演七十多天，演過「夜光杯」「醉生夢死」「雷雨」「日出」等七個劇目，情形都很不錯。本來，在孫敏，龔稼農兩人在那裏表演完畢，先行回滬之後，他們原是準備冉上貴陽去的。當時旣爲貴陽在二月四號受及敵機轟炸，市况不無影饗，大家頗感躊躇。叉爲剛巧看到申報「遊藝界」刋出那一篇「孫敏從昆明歸來」的談話，知道回上海沒有阻難，不免越發倦遊思歸，動了鄕思。這才打定主張隨時便和朱曼華小姐一行三人結伴首途，取道海防轉港回滬了。據王先生談，昆明市上的上海報紙，只有見到「申報」一種，風行一時；但也總得慢到十天之後，才得寄到，眞使旅人們都爲了不勝盼念，常得爲乙望穿秋水的。</p>
<p>各方爭聘出處未定</p>
<p>王先生在銀壇上是飾演反派角色的唯一能手。至今十餘年來，始終莫與頡頏，他還仍在這上面保持着最崇高的地位，在目前魑魅罔兩，公然橫行的現狀之下，那些燃犀燭奸的反面表現，正需他來刻劃在銀幕之上，才會顯出無所遁形的最大力量。關於今後出處問題，他爲各方爭聘不下，一時難以自决。允其在「新華」「明星」兩方面，一面旣爲接洽較早，未便相却；一面又以多年老賓主關係，亦覺甚感爲難。因此躊躇不已，迄尙未能確定。</p>
<h3>伶人動態</h3>
<p>黃桂秋輟演眞相天蟾舞台自名旦黃桂秋，管紹華登台以來，營業平平，台主顧竹軒爲謀補救計，特將座價减低，使趨平民化而易吸收觀衆，桂秋乃以事前並未與本人商洽，有碍聲譽，乃於前日突然諉稱身體不適，須稍休養爲辭，拒絕登台，並自牯嶺路人安里藝員宿舍遷出至法租界愛來格路友人某處。顧氏得訊後，乃派張健飛，常雲恒兩人携包銀二千元至黃處交涉，無結果而返，當晚所貼六月雪一劇，由坤旦雪又琴代演，雪孃色藝，久爲滬人所賞識，竟未發生任何事故，且捧塲之彩聲不絕，大紅特紅，聞桂秋以此番在申遭此失敗慘果，曾效阮郞之痛哭，誓不再來獻藝，惟天蟾方面仍與談判，俟健康恢復後，繼續登台。</p>
<p>王富英昨是銷假　武生王富英，自脫離共舞台，改搭天蟾後，甚受觀衆之歡迎，有人以其前途如何爲詢，則答稱「混到那裏是那裹」，近因略受風塞，偶攖客感，遂於前日向當局請假一天，以資休養，昨日已稍痊愈，銷假登台，演嘉興府一劇周信芳等春宴忙卡爾登大戲院移風劇社周信芳，高百歲，王熙春，金素雯，劉文魁，張慧聰等，前日下午五時，假座錦江餐廳舉行聚餐，周信芳定今日在大雅樓招待全體藝員，舉行春宴，高百歲等角兒，亦擬排日輪流歡突。</p>
<p>張美英乘輪返申先施樂園大京班後台經理張連奎之長女張美英，自赴平拜列五瑤卿門牆，已逾數月，彼姝於前日順天輪自北平返申，當晚至先施後台探視舊友，是否再行北上，尙未决定。</p>

<p>諸葛亮斬刀謖時帶審李七</p>
<p>某年老譚演「空城　」「斬馬謖」，去馬謖的　是李壽山，老譚　後台扮戲的時　，笑謂後台　同行道：「今天我唱」「斬馬謖」，外帶一齣審李七。衆人聽了都莫明其妙，誰知到了把馬謖推出斬首的當兒，只聽大李七仰天哈哈大笑三聲，老譚遂把他喚回，因問道：「將軍爲何發笑？壽山本沒想釗老譚會有這麼一問，登時急得目睜口呆，一句詞也沒回答上來。這樣還有不得倒彩的麽？幸而老譚說了一句「快快推出斬了，才算救了李七。如其不然的話，非待他答出笑的理由，不能饒恕他的。但是這時的馬謖，旣悔恨自已作事疏忽，罪有應得，復顧念家有八旬老母，不能孝養，此時此境，哭都不能成聲，那裏還有心腸去大笑三聲呢？况馬謖的被殺，是他認理服罪，死而無怨，道又與鎖烏龍」（烏常誤作五）劇裹的斬單雄信大不相同。雄信與李世民有殺兄仇恨，屢屢攪亂唐室天下，後旣被擒，瓦崗寨諸弟兄都向前進酒祭奠，雄信因故作豪語道：二十年投胎某再來。所以雄信就刑時，可作三聲在笑，藉以表示生死不足介懷之意。他這種笑是笑給他的大仇人李世民同　成看的，彷佛說你單老爺不在乎這一刀的意思，故而他的笑是對的，是合乎劇情的。「斬馬謖」這戲，不論誰去馬謖一角，也從沒聽說有大笑三聲的這麼回事。獨然這位素不安分，不守戲規的大李七，隨心所欲，任意添改，偏要在這齣戲裏加了三笑。往日同別的老生唱，人家也不與他計較，由他胡鬧一陣算啦。今天寃家路窄，偏偏遇着唱戲認眞，滿肚壞水的老譚，故意突如其來的把他二次招回來，問他個發笑的理由，以致作了個大瘸子，這眞是他作夢也想不到的。老譚先說一斬馬謖」帶一審李七，」大家全玻他朦着，不知是怎麽一回事，及至這齣戲唱完，衆人方才明白老譚所設的「審李七，」原來是審的大李七。</p>

<h3>讀書和衛生</h3>
<p>— 韋華</p>
<p>小朋友：你一定聽到爸爸媽媽或是先生講過下面一類的故事：甚麼映雪讀書啦！甚麼囊螢讀書啦！甚麼鑿壁偷光啦！甚麼頭懸樑錐刺股啦！這一些人對於讀書的用功，當然是極可佩服的，但是我們要不要學他們呢？小朋友：我得告訴你：我們萬不應該學他們，因爲這一些的讀書方法，是最不衛生的！也就是說最有害於身體的！</p>
<p>先說映雪讀書吧！雪的顏色雖然潔白，但是在晚上照出字來，一定還是糢糊不清的，這對於我們的眼睛有很大的害處，眼睛是人體第一件要緊的東西，假如你眼睛壞了，那是一件多麼不幸的事呵！那位映雪讀書的哥哥是因爲沒有錢買油點燈，所以才如此的，你現在如果能夠在電燈下讀書，當然很好；要不然就寗可不讀，壞了眼睛倒不是好耍的事！</p>
<p>此外借螢火蟲的光來讀書，也是不好的，許多的螢炎蟲既然不容易捉到，就是能夠捉到的話，光綫料想也還是很弱的。</p>
<p>再說鑿壁偷光吧，如果你沒有燈光讀書，你設法坐到街邊路燈底下去讀也行的，要不然你還可以到別的地方去找燈光；鑿壁總是一件不大好的事，試想壁上挖下一個窟窿，是多麼不體面的事呀！</p>
<p>最後要說「頭懸樑，錐刺股」了，你懂得這六個字的意思嗎？這就是說從前一個人，讀書非常用功，晚上也不睡覺，但是人在長時間的工作後，總是要疲倦的；眼睛自然要閉合起來，頭部也自然要向下低去，這個人爲了要使自己的頭不往下低，便將自己的頭髪用繩子繫在樑上，同着要使自己不致睡去，便時時用錐子刺自己的屁股和大腿，你看這是一個多麼愚笨的人呀！這樣的用功有甚麼用呢？我們知道年紀大的人，每天要有八小時的睡眠，小朋友們每天至少要有十小時的睡眠；不睡是無論如何要不得的，況且我們的知識，並不專在書本上——大自然便是我們最大的學校！</p>
<h3>童子軍的創始人貝登堡</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>要是充當過童子軍的小朋友，沒有不知道貝登堡這個人的。他是童子軍的創始人，所以每個當童子軍的，都深深地記着他。前天我們紀念中國童子軍節，尤其忘不了他。</p>
<p>他是英國的一位很勇敢，又聰明的軍人，他在軍隊之中，風餐露宿，過着艱苦的生活。但是他有耐勞刻苦的精神，却不覺生活的勞苦。</p>
<p>當公元一八九九年，英國和南非洲的戰爭爆發，他便踏上了戰塲。這次的戰爭，英國雖佔了優勢，但是他總覺得英國的兵士遠不及非洲兵士的刻苦耐勞。他也知道這刻苦耐勞的習慣，是須要在小時候養成的。</p>
<p>於是，在一九〇七年的時候，他便集合了一羣活潑的兒童，編成童子軍；在一個僻靜的島嶼上，開始作種種訓練。不到幾個月，成績果然很好，一個個都變成體格強健，能爲社會服務的有爲的兒童，便爲一般人所認識了。童子軍的事業，也就由英國而普徧於全世界了。</p>
<p>小朋友：請你轉告無力入學的朋友。快到四馬路世界書局隔壁復興里四號二樓義務小學校去報名上課。不收學費還贈送書籍和文具。</p>

<p>諸位小朋友，你們歡喜「睏晏朝」嗎？我想你們一定歡喜的。尤其在冬天的早晨，睡在溫暖的被窩裏，是多麼的舒適呀！但是小朋友們！你們知道「一年之計在於春，一日之計在於晨」這兩句古語嗎？早晨是每天最寶貴的時候，因爲這時的空氣異常清爽，我們的頭腦經過了一夜的休息後，腦力非常的充足，假若在這個時候讀書或者寫字，進步是非常快的，且每天早起，吸些新鮮空氣，對於身體也大有益處。小朋友們！你們願意不願意讓這樣寶貴的早晨，白白的費去嗎？假若不願意的話，那麼從今天起趕快養成早起的習慣，不要貪戀溫暖的被窩，而使寶貴的早晨白白地費去。</p>
<p>有許多小朋友歡喜在晚上讀書或者寫字，這是非常不好的，因爲一個人經過了一天工作之後，到了晚上，精神是非常的疲乏，假若在這個時候讀書，無論如何的用功，其進步一定非常遲緩的，像有時候做到一個難的算題，無論如何的想，總想不出，到了明天早晨再去想一想，很容易的想出來，這便可證明早晨的腦力確要比晚上靈敏得多，所以歡喜在晚上讀書的小朋友們！趕快變更一下，晚上早睡，早晨早起，把晚上要做的功課，放在早晨去做，你們若能照上面一樣，繼續不斷的實行着，我想你們的學問，進步一定是極快的。或許在這學期能考得第一名，當你把獎品和獎狀拿回家後，受到父親母親讚美的時候，那時你們的心裏感到快樂嗎？</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！你們想得獎品和獎狀嗎？趕快在寶貴的早晨努力讀書吧！</p>
<h3>做一個小無綫電家（五）</h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>三，天綫和地綫</p>
<p>「那麼天綫是什麼東西做成的呢」？王民向小花園四周人家屋頂上的天綫看了一會，又問他的堂哥說，王民有這個脾氣，一椿事不懂的時候，他一定要問一個清楚。</p>
<p>「天綫在無綫電行中可以買到，我們不用自己來做，但是做天綫用的東西我可以告訴你：天綫是用許多銅絲（大概七根到八根）絞起來做成一根，兩頭再結上兩個上面講過的絕緣子，然後去張在屋面上就得。」</p>
<p>王民的堂哥說完了上面的一大篇話，這時就頓了一下，搓一搓手，望一望天，忽然又記起了什麼，很急的對王民說：「我還忘了告訴了，天綫還有一種別的式樣。」</p>
<p>「是什麼式樣」？王民很急促的問。</p>
<p>「你慢點，讓我慢慢的來告訴你。關於裝無綫電，也要看地方而定的。譬如在上海，每一條街上都是密密的房子，張起天綫來就非常不容易，比不得在空曠的鄉下，四面都是空地，張起天綫來就非常便當；在這樣的情形下，我們就不得不另外想一個小巧而不佔地位的天綫出來，因爲這天綫是放在房子裏面的，我們就呌做室內天綫，又因爲它的形狀像蛛子的網一樣，所以又呌他做蛛網天綫。</p>
<p>「這一種天綫我倒沒有看見過呢！」王民說。</p>
<p>「你怎樣會看得見？人家都是放在房間裏的。喏，這本書上有一張照，就是這種蛛網天綫。」王民的堂哥隨手拿起一本書來，指着裏面的一張照像圖對王民說（見圖五）。</p>
<p>「這個圖上還有一個架子。」</p>
<p>「是的，整個的天綫身體是裝在一個架子上，而且這架子是可以活動的，四面可以轉來轉去。」</p>
<p>「為什麼要轉來轉去呢？裝定了豈不是好？」王民對於不明瞭的地方老是問，但是他的堂哥也並不覺得麻煩，始終微笑着替他解說。</p>
<p>「是的，本來是可以裝定了不使它動的，但是要知道，裝在房子裏的天綫，它收到的電力一定比房子外的小；所以我們一定要把這種天綫裝成活的，四周的轉來轉去，轉到在收音機裏發出的最響的聲音了，然後把它定住。」停了一停，又說，關於天綫方面，講到這裏可以說完了，現在可以講地綫了。」</p>
<p>「有了天綫還有地綫」？王民覺得非常奇怪。</p>
<p>「地綫在無綫電收音機中也是一件重要的東西，尤其在我們隨後就要實地試裝的礦石機中更爲重要，本來很響的，一拿去地綫就要輕得多。」</p>
<p>「天綫是裝在空中的，那麼地綫可不是裝在地下的」？</p>
<p>「對啊」！他的堂哥說，「地綫是裝在地下的，普通的裝法就用一根很長的鐵棒打到地裏去，再在這根鐵棒上連出一根綫來接在收音機上就可以了。」</p>

<p>春的專頁</p>
<h3>春來了</h3>
<p>— 早春小學六年組生　鄭本仁</p>
<p>春之神已降臨了！宇宙間的一切生物，都在欣欣地歡迎着。牠把萎靡憔悴的大地，裝點得如美女一般。春之神！你的力量是多麼偉大啊！</p>
<p>聽啊！那可愛而活潑的小鳥兒，在枝頭上唱着春歌，似乎在督促人們趕快去工作，不要虛度這快樂的春天。</p>
<p>看啊！那許多草木都透出鮮嫩的葉，開出美麗的鮮花，這一切的景象，好條都表示出春天的快樂！啊！溫和的天氣，秀麗的風景，春天是多麼可愛啊！</p>
<p>這可愛的春天，牠帶來了這樣好的景緻，一幕一幕地演給我們看，使我們身心舒暢，精神愉快，我們應該怎樣感謝它呢？</p>
<p>同學們！一年之計在於春，現已春到人間，我們快快及時努力吧！</p>
<h3>春天與讀書</h3>
<p>— 國光小學四年級生　郭豫昇</p>
<p>冬天的枯草，到了這時已是欣欣向榮了，馬路帝的老樹，亦發新芽了，蟲鳥們亦蠕蠕地生動了。號稱爲萬物之靈的人們，在這春天裏，當然是覺得很快樂的，然而可愛的春天，仍是像飛一般的過去，古人說：「一年之計在於春」，所以我們在這風和日暖的春天裏，應該格外的用心讀書，不然的話，就要再過一年，才有這個明媚的春光。</p>
<p>一年中，我們讀書，覺得最有興趣，最有進步的一季，莫不是春天呀？在夏天，有悶熱的日光，在秋季，有嘈雜的蟲聲，在隆冬，有凜烈的朔風，所以要努力吧讀書，除了春天，還有那一季呢？</p>
<p>努力吧！朋友！莫辜負這春天。</p>
<h3>春天的感想</h3>
<p>— 上海小學六年級生　楊聖</p>
<p>春天又來了！和暖的春光將殘酷的寒冬趕走了！我們在明媚的陽光下，聽着小鳥兒在唱着婉轉的歌，看着花草漸漸在土壤中生長，啊！我們是多麼快樂啊！</p>
<p>但是我却從春天的到臨，得到一個感想：</p>
<p>我們所遇到的殘酷的寒冷，正如我們做事時遇到的挫折，春天的到來，也正如我們做事的成功，我們耐了冷，才會享春天的和暖，這就是告訴我們說：「做事時克服了一切困難，忍耐着一切失敗，才會得到美滿的結果。」</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們！你們現在不要再玩吧！等到自己或國家的專業得到美滿的結果時，再來大大地慶祝吧！</p>
<h3>故鄕的春</h3>
<p>— 震東小學六年級生　馬元鏞</p>
<p>二十八年的春，已降臨到了人間，無疑的，又是一年開始了，春好像是個溫柔的姑娘，也好像是個慈愛的老母，她給予我們的是溫暖的風，和煦的陽光，大地上的一切生物，經過了春的撫育，都蓬蓬勃勃的滋長，茁芽，人們也受了春光的洗禮，覺得精神百倍。「春」，並沒有一點偏私，一視同仁的踏進了鐵蹄蹂躪下的故鄉，想起了故鄉，不禁使我要悽然了記得前年的今日，我們一羣小孩子，在春神的保護之下，作郊外春游，那時桃紅柳綠，是多麼美觀呀，而今呢？美麗的故鄉，衹勝了些斷磚殘瓦，一片焦土，沒有以前的可愛了，況且我們的幾個小朋友，也死的死了跑的跑了，再沒有見面的機會，天呀！是誰剝奪了我們春天的一切權利，故鄉的春，是不能再去欣賞了。</p>
<h3>小小的東西</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>一座很高的牆是許多塊的磚砌成的；一段很長的路程是被許多個「一步」「一步」走完的；假使沒有磚就沒有高牆，不肯舉一步，連一段短短的路程也走不完。</p>
<p>再拿更大的東西來譬喻：一座高山是許許多多塊的泥土積成的，假如一塊泥土都沒有，那裏來的高山？大海洋裏的水是一滴滴積下來的，假如一滴水都沒有，那裏來的大海洋？</p>
<p>有些小朋友說:一個銅子橫堅買不到別的東西，不如隨便去用它。有些小朋友說：每天早晨早起二十分鍾仍舊沒有工作做出，不如索性不要早起，可是每天一個銅元，積了一年有一元二角多，每天讀兩頁書，一年也可以讀完一本很厚的書。</p>
<p>古人說：「不以利少而不爲不以害少而爲之。」意思說，有一件好事，做出來利益雖然很少，却不應該因爲它利益少就不去做；一件壞事，做出來害處雖然很少，也不應該因爲它害處很少就去做它。</p>
<p>看見地上有一片香蕉皮，把它拾起來，利益雖然很少，算不定已經救了一個老人·捐了一分錢做難民捐，利益雖很少，算不定已經使一個難童不致餓死，吐一口痰在地上，雖然看來害處很少，算不定因你的一口痰使許多人生病。</p>
<h3>江山船</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>—明兒避難記之十六—</p>
<p>那一艘龐大的船向着遼闊的錢塘江的上游駛去。江面兩旁遙遠的小樹，矮矮的，參參差差的，明兒望去有些迷糊了，似乎那些樹在旋轉的向後退去，這是船在向前的緣故·江水不住的打在船板上，成了雪白的浪花而轉瞬間，便無形無蹤了，同時更發出一陣撲擈的水聲。</p>
<p>明兒是破題兒第一遭在船上度生活，更從來沒有乘過這種用人力來使船前進的大船，他問了父親後，才知道這呌江山船，因此他覺得這機會是很難得的，如果不是逃難的話，誰高興來乘這樣笨重而遲慢的船。</p>
<p>那船用杉木構成，船夫是很愛惜的，因爲這是他唯一的生命綫，因此在船的周身塗上了一層黃潤潤的桐油，更沒有絲毫的泥土沾染在上面，這表示出很是整潔和樸實的樣兒。船棚是由蘆葉和竹片編成的，半圓的罩在船上，這便是船艙。前面裝上了門板，更有玻璃窗，很是講究。艙裏搭了六個低矮的鋪位，在鋪位上面，一個個的木架，安放些船上所需要的一切器具，竹篙哪，木槳哪，　帽哪，簑衣哪等等。船艙後梢的一角地方，放着兩隻最緊要的東西——柴灶。它附近的船板上，釘上了洋鐵皮，揩得雪白似的像新的一般。再過去些，掛着一根根的竹筒，裏面盛的是油·監·醬油等東西，掛在高處，真是一些兒也不佔地位。在船上的一切，可說都是整潔樸素，佈置得井井有條，每一寸的地方都被利用得所謂合乎經濟的原則。</p>
<p>在船梢上，立着一個白髪斑斑的老頭兒，身材也不十分高大，面麗粗黃而黑，一絲絲的皺紋如蜘網般的密布在額上衣服是很清潔樸實，滿腮粗短的鬍髭，他一手把烟斗塞在嘴邊，一隻手把着舵，現出很自在的樣兒，據說是船老大的父親。</p>
<p>一個婦人拿着飯籃，彎着腰，差不多半個身上在船外，兩隻粗糙的手在淘着米，因爲船板是很高的，非要這樣不可。伊梳着一個大大的髪髻，身穿藏青的花布，身子似乎很結實，可是伊的腳是纏小的，可見在內地，要轉變這根深蒂固的風氣，是不容易的。</p>
<p>在船頭上，一根直貫雲霄的桅桿，直直地似乎依靠在船篷上。船老大立在船頭打着篙，四個船夫分列在兩旁，也各有用力的撐篙。那船頭是很尖而高的，很似龍船一般，這可以減小水的阻力。</p>
<p>明兒是這樣細細的看了個明白，因爲他實在太無聊，在船艙裏看得厭了，走出船艙，伸着頭他望望四周的景色，看得太無味了，便走了進去，不是躺便是向母親要東西吃。明兒覺得比了在到杭州的小船上是自由得了，不過到屯溪是不知道要多少日子哩。船又駛得這樣慢，怪悶氣的。</p>
<h3>沙眼</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>近幾星期來，英兒晚上溫課，總覺得眼睛像有什麼東西在摩擦似的，而且見了燈光睜不開眼，要流淚。但是，英兒並不把這件事告他的媽媽，以爲這是多看書，眼睛疲乏的緣故。後來，他的眼睛摩擦得一天比一天厲害了，一天比一天難過了。</p>
<p>英兒害怕起來，對他的媽媽說道：</p>
<p>「媽，近來我的眼睛裏，像有什麼東西在摩擦似的，時常要流淚，這是什麼一回事？」</p>
<p>「你爲什麼不早些告訴我？」媽媽埋怨他說，「這一定是沙眼的了，明天我領你去找眼科醫生。」</p>
<p>「什麼呌沙眼？我不懂。」</p>
<p>「沙眼是一種傳染病，染着了，內眼皮上就要生出一粒一粒的東西來，像沙粒一般。如果不去醫它，就要一年厲害一年，說不定會瞎了眼。以後你在理髪店，戲院，菜館這些公共地方，切不可拿他們的面巾來揩眼睛，因爲這些面巾是沙眼的媒介。」</p>
<p>第二天，媽媽領着英兒，到一個眼科醫生那裏去，醫生盡心地治療。一個月之後，英兒的沙眼痊愈了，再也不摩擦，再也不流淚了。</p>
<h3>白雪公主（十一）</h3>
<p>— 天孫</p>
<p>但那白雪公主帶勸帶騙的同他們到外面塲地上的水槽旁去，開始洗起浴來。伊回到屋子裏去時，見他們正把水潑了一身，亂擦亂抹，非常的高興，只有老頑固一個人還是不肯去洗。</p>
<p>他還站在旁邊嘲笑他的伙伴們：「呵呵，你們是好一束美麗的小蓮花啊！你們且等着吧。伊還得取了紅帶子，把你們的鬍子紥縛起來，更要在你們的耳朶後面洒些兒香水哩！我倒要瞧誰有這能耐，來使我洗一個浴，我才佩服他呢！」</p>
<p>他這麼一說，其餘的矮人們立時趕將過去，把老頑固抬到水槽旁來，預備把他撳在水中。</p>
<p>正在這當兒，猛聽得白雪公主在那裏喊道：「晚餐預備好了！」</p>
<p>他們把老頑固自水中一拋，好似拋下一隻熱山薯一般。六個矮人便高高興興地回到屋子裏用晚餐去了。</p>
<p>在那王宮裏頭，却有萬惡的事情，在進行中了。王后既從那面魔鏡中知道了獵官違背命令，沒有將白雪公主殺死，反把伊悄悄的放走了。王后氣憤之餘，對天王下誓來，伊要是一天不結果白雪，伊就一天不睡覺，一天不吃東西，這一個決心，誰也動搖不得的。於是伊急急的準備一切，打算明天早上親自趕往七矮人那裏去。</p>
<p>王后先搶到了一本破舊不堪的書，一個個蜘蛛正從那些蒙滿灰塵顏色黃黯的紙張間爬將出來，伊也好似沒有瞧見一樣，只是急不及待的將那書一頁頁的翻動着，末後翻到了關於化裝的一頁，伊認爲滿意，決定照着那麼辦。</p>
<p>當下伊自言自語的道：「這正是我所想到的，化裝一個賣雜貨的老婆子！那位白雪小公主一定上當，決不會趕走一個可憐的賣雜貨老婆子的。我得賣些好東西給伊，都是些很美麗的東西！哼，是啊，我還得把「死」賣給伊哩！」</p>
<p>這時王后真好像一個瘋婦一般，在那些彎頸蒸溜器和玻璃瓶中間跑來跑去，東也看看，西也望望；末後便取起一個雕成死人頭形的淡藍色的杯子來，倒了幾種奇怪的流質物在內，攪和起來。</p>
<p>伊攪好之後，便把杯子湊到嘴邊，一口氣將那滿杯的流質物喝了下去。說也奇怪，不多一會，王后就變成了模樣兒很可怕的老婆子，兩手的指爪，如同獸爪，笑起來活像鬼呌一樣，十分怕人，伊那寵愛的烏鴉，停住在一個骷髏上，看着伊手忙腳亂的準備一切，準備結果白雪公主的性命。王后放出一種陰狠可怕的聲音，很得意的對自已說道：「呵呵，這一下做得再巧妙也沒有了，一隻毒蘋果，只須咬上一口，就會像睡熟一般的死去，再也醒不回來，那些矮人們可要把白雪那小東西生生的活埋了！至於解毒的丹方呢，也未始沒有，必須要愛人的第一個接吻，才能把伊救醒，可是伊那裏有甚麼愛人，有那一個去救醒伊呢，呵，呵，呵，呵！」</p>

They killed over sixty Japanese soldiers, captured countless supplies, and used explosives to destroy important highways, bridges, and telegraph lines between Chengde and Gubeikou. After achieving their objective, the Chinese troops withdrew swiftly. Currently, transportation on highways both inside and outside the pass has been disrupted and has not yet been restored.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Recent War Situation</h3>
<p>In the past two or three weeks, the situation on the European continent has been extremely tense, and the situation in the Shanghai concessions has been very serious. At the same time, the fighting in various parts of China has also been intense for a while, but has now eased down. This ebb and flow of the situation illustrates that although the Japanese military in China will not collapse immediately, it has already reached the end of its strength. At the same time, it also confirms the correctness of the theory of China's protracted war of resistance. In fact, the Chinese military already has a considerable grasp of victory. However, this ebb and flow situation will continue to occur frequently in the future, and China's heroic fighters must continue to endure great sacrifices in order to drive the enemy away step by step until the complete restoration of the country.</p>
<p>The recent war can be divided into several aspects: In the Hubei area, the Japanese army attempted to seize Xiangfan. If Xiangfan were captured, not only could Wuhan be consolidated, but also Yunyang could be approached to the north, Guanzhong could be viewed in the northwest, and Jingyi could be pointed to the south, controlling the key roads into Sichuan and the upper reaches of Dongting Lake. However, the Japanese army attacking Xiangfan was stranded in Zhongxiang, confined to the east bank of the Xiang River, and has become a defensive position. Another route in the Xihe area encountered strong resistance, with casualties reaching more than 30,000, and currently cannot take any action, so the attempt in this area has obviously stalled. In the Shanxi area, the Japanese army used the railway line of Taiyuan, Linfen, Xinxing and other places as a base, attempting to advance westward across the river in two routes, north and south, to capture the northwest. However, repeated attacks were frustrated, and the rear flanks were severely attacked by the heroic guerrilla troops, with heavy casualties, resulting in a retreat to the original location without any progress. In the northern Jiangsu area, the Japanese army attempted to open up the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, attacking Huaiyin by land and sea from Tongshan and Lianyungang. Although Huaiyin has fallen, the Japanese army in Yangzhou in the south was blocked at Zhaoguanba, and the Japanese army in Nantong was wandering around Rugao and Taixian, unable to establish contact to the north, and recently there has been news of the recapture of Siyang and Lianshui, then the Japanese army in Huaiyin is simply isolated and the attempt to control northern Jiangsu is very difficult to succeed. In the Guangdong area, although Hainan Island is in a special situation, the Japanese army has never been able to penetrate inland; as for the Yuejiang River basin, although the Japanese army is frequently dispatched, the role is only to defend against the counteroffensive of the Chinese army, and there is no positive significance. In addition, in the northern Jiangxi area, the Japanese army has attempted to bypass the east of Poyang Lake to attack Nanchang, but the Chinese army's preparations have been very sufficient, and the war has not made much progress in recent days. In the eastern Zhejiang area, although the Japanese navy has repeatedly declared that it will attack Linhai, the purpose is only to contain the Chinese army's forces to counterattack Hangzhou, so there is no fact of the attack at all, but only a bluff.</p>
<p>In the recent war situation in various places, several characteristics can be clearly found: First, the Japanese army can no longer coordinate in all directions like before, and jointly attack a certain point, but only launch local attacks in various places. And the targets of the launch are also very inconsistent, rather than actively preparing for a new offensive, it is better to say that it is a passive defense of the military strongholds that have been obtained, which is enough to prove that the Japanese army has turned from an active to a passive stage. Second, the various parts of the Japanese army have lost their coordination. For example, when the Japanese army in central Hubei attempted to capture Xiangfan, the Japanese army in eastern Henan did not have any intention of responding to the west; and when the Japanese army in Xuhai attacked Qingjiangpu to the south, the Japanese army in Tongyang did not actively coordinate. Here, it can be seen that either the Japanese army's own orders cannot be unified, or their deployment has already revealed embarrassment. Third, China's guerrilla warfare has gradually produced positive effects. For example, when the Japanese army in Wuhan attacked north, the guerrilla warfare in eastern and southern Hubei was greatly launched, containing the Japanese army's advance, and as soon as Huaiyin in northern Jiangsu was lost, guerrilla troops were immediately deployed on the east and west sides of the Grand Canal, making the Japanese army fall into isolation. In addition, guerrilla warfare is widely developing in various places in southern Shandong, eastern Shandong, western Zhejiang, and southern Hebei, containing a lot of the Japanese army's forces and making them exhausted to deal with it; as for the control of the situation in northern China by the guerrilla forces in the highlands of Shanxi, preventing the Japanese army's attempt to invade the west, it has been more than a year ago, and now it is becoming more and more effective, and there is even the possibility of completely annihilating the Japanese army. Fourth, the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army has been gradually strengthened. In the decisive battle of Zhongxiang, the number of casualties of the Chinese and Japanese armies has become a one-to-one ratio. Summarizing the above points, we can see that judging from the military situation alone, China's war of resistance has turned into a favorable stage. What's more, in addition to the military, there are various aspects such as diplomacy and economy, and the rise and fall between China and Japan are all in the key to transformation!</p>
<p>China is currently grasping this favorable situation of military, diplomatic, and economic coordination, and in the near future, it will launch a large-scale counteroffensive scene. Heroic fighters, should rejoice for the expected great victory!</p>
<h3>Assassin of Fan Shisheng Surrenders</h3>
<p>The Assassin is the Son of Deceased Officer Zhen; Yang Weiqian Confesses that He Took Revenge for His Father</p>
<p>(Kunming) In the case of the assassination of Fan Shisheng, it is reported that the assassin has surrendered himself to the police station and issued a confession of revenge for his father. The police station has now transferred the assassin to the court for trial. Fan's body was moved to his private residence for encoffining on the evening of the 17th. His family has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Long Yun, reporting the circumstances of Fan's assassination and requesting that the assassin be punished according to law. Fan was 53 years old, graduated from the special class of the Yunnan Suoying School, and served as the captain of the 1st Battalion of the Northern Expeditionary Army Artillery, director of the Yunnan Kaiwu General Office Advisory Office, commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment of the Army, commander of the 2nd Army of the Yunnan Army stationed in Guangdong, commander of the 16th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, commander of the Xiangfan Garrison, and commander of the 51st Division, and member of the National Anti-Smoking Committee. His mother is over eighty years old and still alive, and his wife is currently living in Shanghai, leaving behind two daughters and one son (only four years old). His posthumous affairs are extremely desolate. (17th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Kunming) After the Fan case occurred, the local authorities here paid great attention to it. According to the assassin Yang Weiqian's father, the late officer Yang Zhen, was Fan's classmate and comrade. When Yang was a regimental commander, Fan served as his regimental adjutant. Until the 14th year of the Republic of China, Yang was the front-line commander of Fan's troops stationed in Nanning. Fan and Yang lived in the same room. Yang was assassinated by mutinous soldiers, but Fan survived unscathed. Therefore, Yang's son suspected that his father's death was instigated by Fan. This is the motive for the assassination. According to his confession, it was purely revenge for his father. (17th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin today telegraphed Chairman Long to express his condolences to the family of Lieutenant General Fan Shisheng on his behalf. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Chairman Long Zhizhou of Kunming, I am grieved to hear the news that Lieutenant General Fan Shisheng, a member of the Military Commission, was assassinated and killed in Yunnan. Fan joined the revolutionary work early in his career and made remarkable achievements. In recent years, he has devoted himself to healing the sick and saving the world, which is particularly commendable. He was killed unexpectedly, and I deeply mourn his loss. Please send someone nearby to express condolences to his family on his behalf. It is heard that the assassin has been apprehended, and I hope that the details of the interrogation will be shown.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Xian County Killed Over a Hundred</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese garrison in Xian County, central Hebei, requested the dispatch of a troupe of prostitutes to "comfort" the soldiers. Japanese in Baoding then hired thirty Chinese prostitutes and twenty Korean prostitutes, guaranteeing their safe return with a deposit. The prostitutes were paid two yuan per day, with meals provided. A Baoding guerrilla spy obtained the information and reported it to the guerrilla headquarters, estimating that the prostitute troupe would arrive in Xian County on a certain day. The guerrillas anticipated that the Japanese garrison would be less vigilant after the arrival of the prostitute troupe, so they attacked Xian County at that time. As a result, one-third of the 300 Japanese soldiers were killed. Some of the prostitutes were killed by the Japanese army, some joined the guerrillas, and others remained in Xian County.

Chen, the company commander of the Chinese army, personally led his troops and used machine guns to fire densely at the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers, unable to withstand the attack, attempted to flee. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue and completely annihilate them. Two Japanese aircraft happened to fly in at that time and circled in the air, covering the remaining Japanese soldiers, who were able to escape. (18th Telegram)</p>

Its development is worthy of attention. (18th Fast News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Still Held by Bandits</h3>
<p>The Kidnapping of Mr. Otte</p>
<p>Mr. Otte, the 52-year-old Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, was kidnapped yesterday afternoon from his residence in the former German concession by three Chinese men. He is still in the hands of the bandits. Previous reports that Mr. Otte had escaped were inaccurate, caused by a misreport from a village 12 miles away on the Tianjin-Gugu Highway. The actual situation is that around 3:30 PM yesterday, Japanese sentries in that village saw a car carrying one foreigner and three Chinese men, driven by a Chinese chauffeur. They ordered it to stop, but the chauffeur sped up and raced through the village gate. Major Mayne of the British Army in Tianjin, escorted by 30 Japanese soldiers, went to the village to search for Mr. Otte and learned the details. Initially, it was planned to have British police conduct the search, but at the last minute, the plan was changed, and Major Mayne was assigned the task. The 30 Japanese soldiers accompanying Major Mayne carried two machine guns. According to the Japanese sentries, they were under orders not to fire at vehicles carrying foreigners, so they could not stop the car carrying Mr. Otte. A phone call was immediately made to a village six miles away to inquire about the car's passage, and the Tianjin authorities were informed. The misunderstanding of these phone calls led to the false report of Mr. Otte's escape. When Major Mayne arrived at the village, he questioned the Japanese sentries and police, but could not obtain any further information. He then went with the Japanese guards to the village six miles away, but the villagers said they had not seen a car carrying a foreigner. Major Mayne and his party traveled between the two villages, but in the dim light, it was difficult to determine if the car had driven off the main road, although it was considered difficult, as there were deep ditches on both sides of the road. Major Mayne and his party conducted a search as far as Dazhan, but without any results. No one said they had seen a car pass in the afternoon. Major Mayne returned to Tianjin this morning.

<h3>Where Is the Good Faith in Breaking Promises? Chamberlain Warns Hitler</h3>
<p>The Use of Violence Will Inevitably Backfire. Britain's Policy Toward Germany Turns Tough</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham tonight, saying, "The major events currently taking place in Europe have made all other matters secondary. I believe that what you all want to hear is an expression of the British government's views on these disputes. There is no doubt that world opinion is now more shocked than ever by the actions of the German government. What kind of impact this turbulence will have is unpredictable, but I am certain that its future consequences will be far-reaching. On Wednesday, due to insufficient information, I had to make cautious and restrained remarks on what I considered at the time to be an inconvenient situation to criticize, and my words were slightly calm and objective, leading to misunderstandings that I was not very moved by this event. This is actually wrong, and I want to correct it tonight."</p>
<h3>First, Defending the Policy of Appeasement</h3>
<p>Critics say that the occupation of Czechoslovakia was a direct consequence of my trip to Germany last autumn, and that the result of recent events, the tearing up of the Munich Agreement, proves that my trip to Germany was a complete failure. It is further said that this is the Prime Minister's personal policy, so the Prime Minister must bear the responsibility for the fate of Czechoslovakia. The above conclusions are completely unfounded. My trip to Germany, its first main reason, was that the situation at that time was extremely dangerous, and the only opportunity to save the European war seemed to be here. The first objective of my trip to Germany was finally achieved, and European peace was preserved. Without this trip, I don’t know how many hundreds of thousands of families in Europe would be crying today. Of course, I don’t need to defend my trip to Germany. If it hadn’t happened that day, I ask, what would the situation be like? What Britain, France, and Russia could have done may not have been able to protect Czechoslovakia from aggression and destruction. From our sending troops to fight Germany, and finally winning victory after terrible losses, we would never have created Czechoslovakia as stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. I went to Munich to promote the so-called European appeasement policy. For this policy to succeed, the great powers must abandon their ambition to dominate Europe, and focus on seeking reasonable conveniences, so as to develop their own interests, consolidate their own international trade, and improve the conditions of their own people."</p>
<h3>Germany's Solemn Promises Are Still in My Ears</h3>
<p>At that time, Hitler made a promise in Munich, stating that his territorial ambition in Europe would not extend beyond the Sudetenland. Hitler also reiterated this in Berlin. I feel that this repeatedly stated guarantee can be hoped to solve the Czech problem from now on, because the situation in Munich that day seemed to be able to proceed with the appeasement policy. However, I will not prepare to relax my vigilance until the appeasement policy has been established and accepted by other countries. Therefore, after the Munich Conference, our national defense program was actually carried out and expanded, in order to remedy certain weaknesses found in the crisis. I firmly know that after the Munich Conference, most of the people in the United Kingdom shared the same hope as me, and were eager for the appeasement policy to proceed without stagnation, but today this hope has been completely shattered, and this is what I and most of my compatriots are disappointed and indignant about. How can the recent events be reconciled with the guarantees I just mentioned? I am one of the signatories of the Munich Agreement. If Hitler thought that he should cancel the previous one, he should have consulted me in accordance with the Munich Declaration, but he didn't do this. Hitler acted arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>The Czech People Were Actually Poisoned</h3>
<p>When the Czech President had not yet received the German demands that he could not refuse, the German army had already set out on the way and entered the Czech capital in a few hours, forcibly making Czechoslovakia its vassal state. Then, the brave Czech people were suddenly poisoned, their freedom was cut, and their independence was dead. How can we not sympathize with them? Where is the so-called no more territorial ambitions now? Where is the so-called never absorbing the Czech people into Germany now? Where is the principle of self-determination that Hitler strongly argued to me when he advocated the separation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in Berchtesgaden? Such solemn guarantees, repeatedly stated, were ignored. If a good reason can still be easily found to cover up its wrongdoings, then any other guarantee from the same party, how can the question of how to trust it not arise? The events of this week were caused by the German government's complete disregard for its own principles.</p>
<h3>The Starting Point of a New Adventurous Attempt</h3>
<p>We cannot help but ask ourselves, is this the end of the old adventurous attempts, or the beginning of new adventurous attempts? Is this the last blow to the weaker countries, or will there be successors? Is this a step in an attempt to dominate the world by force? These are serious and urgent questions. Please forgive me for not answering them tonight. However, I am certain that not only Germany's neighbors, but also other countries that are farther away, even countries far beyond Europe, will give serious and urgent consideration to these questions. Judging from the existing scene, this trend has already begun and will obviously progress rapidly.</p>
<h3>Taking the Maintenance of Freedom as a Vocation</h3>
<p>As far as we ourselves are concerned, we must of course first pay attention to the various parts within the British Empire, and definitely to France, which has close relations with Britain. We must now review the situation with the practical responsibility required by the seriousness of the situation. All matters related to national security must be included in the review. We must look at the points on which our national life depends from the standpoint of national security. For the sake of peace, nothing cannot be sacrificed, but there is one thing that cannot be sacrificed, that is, the freedom that we have enjoyed for thousands of years, and we will never give it up. I am certainly not prepared to subject our country to new and unlimited restraints, but if outsiders say that our country is not prepared to participate in actions to resist challenges with all its strength, then their mistake is nothing more than this. When I say this, I am sure that I have not only obtained the support, sympathy, and trust of all the people in our country, but also the approval of the entire British Empire and other countries in the world that love peace, but love freedom even more. After the audience heard Chamberlain's last paragraph, applause and cheers continued incessantly. The audience then thanked the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister replied, "We do not need to be saddened. Britain is a powerful country, even stronger than it was six months ago. All acts of violence and injustice will be repaid sooner or later. Every act of aggression by Germany has brought new dangers to Germany's future. I dare to predict that Germany will deeply hate what its government is doing now." (Reuter, 17th)</p>
<h3>Positive Reviews from the United States and France</h3>
<p>(Washington) The speech delivered by the British Prime Minister in Birmingham yesterday has been praised by political figures here, who all say that Britain's attitude has changed and that it is no longer compromising with Germany. In other words, Chamberlain has frankly admitted that the "appeasement policy" previously pursued was indeed a mistake, and has expressed his willingness to follow President Roosevelt and present himself as a defender of democracy and freedom, which is gratifying. As for American public opinion, there were originally those who supported the appeasement policy and those who supported President Roosevelt's policy, but now that the British policy has changed, there will inevitably be a significant impact on American public opinion. In addition, there is one more thing to mention, that is, when Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered his speech last night, most of the important figures in the United States listened remotely via radio, and deeply felt that his tone revealed his being fooled by Hitler. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French newspapers generally believe that the importance of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday must be judged by focusing more on Chamberlain's well-known conservative nature than on the rather serious words used in the speech. Le Petit Journal said that Chamberlain had previously made remarks that Germany would deeply regret the actions of its government. Chamberlain's making this statement is because he deeply knows that he must treat force with force, and all reconciliation efforts are considered cowardly. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<h3>Impressions of Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers here have not yet carried a single word of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech. A spokesman for the officialdom told a Reuters reporter that German officials did not have time to thoroughly study it, but another spokesman for the political circles said that in terms of the situation, Chamberlain's speech was extremely radical and unfair. Chamberlain's attitude is probably due to the influence of Roosevelt's remarks. The extent to which Britain and France welcome this kind of discussion has made a deep impression in Germany. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the British Prime Minister delivered a speech in Birmingham yesterday, severely criticizing Hitler, people from all walks of life here, although seemingly not paying much attention to it, were actually unable to remain unmoved. Diplomatic figures said that this speech is of great significance, and the future impact is incalculable. What is noteworthy is that the United States has already reacted, and the current neutrality law in that country will be amended in the short term. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Romania Is Relieved</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is heard here that the speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday was greatly relieved, because Chamberlain stated that Britain will not give up its interests in southeastern Europe. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Recall Their Ambassadors to Germany</h3>
<p>(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has been recalled home to report on the situation in Central Europe and is scheduled to leave for home today. (Haitong Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible officials here recently announced that the government has telegraphed Ambassador to Germany Coulondre to return home on the morning of the 20th of this month to report on his duties. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Some newspapers here expect that the French government will visit the British government's actions and recall its ambassador to Germany to report on his duties. Everyone feels that although this move does not sever diplomatic relations, it is a good way to express dissatisfaction with the act of breaking promises. (Reuter, 18th)</p>

<h3>Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union Join Hands in Governing the Country</h3>
<p>There is a Possibility of Forming an Anti-Dictatorial Front. Frequent Diplomatic Contacts in London</p>
<p>(London) At 5 PM today, the British Cabinet convened a special meeting. It is heard that the British Cabinet will consider protesting against Germany's violation of the Munich Agreement. If the Cabinet passes the protest to Germany, it must be postponed for the time being, because the British side is currently waiting for Hitler to issue a reply to Chamberlain's speech. It is rumored that Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union will form a common front against totalitarian countries. Judging from Italy's serious attitude towards Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia, this move is not impossible. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures here recently declared that the representatives of the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are conducting talks in London. Although this has not been confirmed so far, the British authorities are indeed planning to invite Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov to London. In addition, political figures also commented on the speech delivered by Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday, believing that the Prime Minister has fully recognized the lessons learned in this decisive incident, and therefore should replace the "idealistic policy" with a "realistic policy." (Havas Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Halifax met with French Ambassador Corbin, US Ambassador Kennedy, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, and German Ambassador Dirkson this morning, and instructed Ambassador to Germany Henderson to make representations to the German government regarding the decisive incident in Czechoslovakia, stating that the actions taken by Germany are in conflict with the Munich Agreement.

Preparations are being made for a grand welcome ceremony. As for the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Leader Hitler is unwilling to express his position until he understands the attitudes of various countries. Therefore, the House of Representatives may not convene a meeting for the time being. (Havas Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>Vienna: Leader Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army General Keitel, Director of Political Affairs of the Prime Minister's Office Lammers, Chief of the Political Police Himmler, and Director of the Foreign Intelligence Office Dietrich, returned to this city from Brno at 5 PM yesterday. (Havas Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Thousands of National Socialist Party members cheered for Hitler along the way to show their welcome.

<p>Warsaw: More than a thousand people here held an anti-German demonstration this afternoon, which was extremely intense, and shouted slogans such as "Down with Hitler" and "Long live democracy." They then wanted to march to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but were dispersed by mounted police, and many were injured. At night, the glass windows of several German stores were smashed, and the police authorities had to send more police officers to patrol the streets to maintain order. (Havas Telegraph, 17th)</p>

<h3>US Government Issues Declaration Condemning Germany's Actions as Illegal</h3>
<p>Peace Can Only Be Maintained Through Respect for International Law and Order; President Roosevelt Believes Neutrality Law Needs Revision</p>
<p>(Washington) US Under Secretary of State Welles, with President Roosevelt's permission, issued a statement yesterday condemning Germany's actions as outrageous and illegal, stating, "The US government has repeatedly stated that it firmly believes that world peace can only be maintained if all countries in the world respect and support world order and the rule of law. The US government cannot but denounce the action of eliminating the freedom of an independent nation by force. The US government's position has long been declared to the world, that is, the US has always emphasized the sanctity of treaties and promises, has always advocated non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and has repeatedly expressed its condemnation of military aggression. Actions that disregard international law and actions of force are actions that endanger world peace and the foundation of culture. The events of the past three months have fully demonstrated the absolute accuracy of the US's claims, that is, world peace must be effective only if all countries can abide by the principles of world peace." (AP, 18th) Simultaneously, President Roosevelt, after Welles issued this statement, also told reporters that the US, due to changes in the European situation, must enact a new neutrality law and indicated that this matter is currently being discussed with congressional leaders and national defense leaders. According to the President's message to Congress on January 4 of this year, the current neutrality law is not applicable because it not only does not help peaceful countries but also helps belligerent countries. According to the President at the time, to curb the rampant flow of aggression, the US has more powerful methods than empty words, apart from using war. The President also stated last night that the US is not prepared to recognize Franco. At the same time, the US Treasury Department also announced the revocation of the preferential terms previously granted to Czechoslovakia. Thereafter, imports of Czech goods will be subject to the same high US tariffs as German goods. As for the Guam port project development case, the President stated that it will be incorporated into the river and sea port project for handling, which shows that the US will still proceed with the defense of Guam to warn aggressive countries in the Far East. (AP, 18th)</p>
<p>Judgmental Tone; Extremely Worth Pondering</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources here, Under Secretary of State Welles' formal statement today condemning the German government's outrageous and illegal remarks intentionally abandoned polite diplomatic language and used a judgmental tone. According to a spokesperson close to the government, we no longer need to make pitiful justifications for aggression. At the very least, the world can now see our position. Democratic Senator King delivered a speech in the Senate today, stating that Britain and France's attitude towards the robbery of Czechoslovakia was to stand by and watch. He wants the US to sever all relations with all aggressor nations. The news that the British ambassador to Germany has been recalled is very welcome here, saying that although this move is a bit late, it can still connect Britain with President Roosevelt's actions last November. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Righteous Assistance to the Weak</p>
<p>(Washington) Under Secretary of State Welles' formal declaration on the Central European incident stated that Czechoslovakia's freedom was "temporarily extinguished." Responsible persons here recently commented that the US government does not intend to directly or indirectly recognize Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia as a legal act, as can be seen from the word "temporarily." Political figures also said that the government does not intend to recognize the new situation in Central Europe for a long time. The State Department will still recognize Hurban, the Czech ambassador. So far, the German government has neither formally offered an explanation nor stated its intentions. The current tense relationship between the US and Germany will inevitably be intensified by this. People in the State Department recently issued a statement saying that the US government has expressed its indignation at Germany's further act of aggression, so the spiritual strength of the democratic countries in Europe can be reunited. In addition, it is said that the US government intends to fully support the Czech people in restoring independence and has informally encouraged Czech Ambassador Hurban to maintain a stance of resistance. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Czech Loans to the US Subject to Additional Taxes</p>
<p>(Washington) Responsible persons recently declared that after Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the US government does not intend to directly or indirectly recognize it as a legal act, but when goods from Moravia and Bohemia are imported into the US in the future, they should be required to pay additional taxes, just like goods from mainland Germany. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Czech Embassy in the US</p>
<p>Refuses to Hand Over to Germany</p>
<p>(Washington) Czech Ambassador to the US Hurban recently received instructions from Foreign Minister Chvalkovský to hand over the embassy to the German embassy, but Ambassador Hurban, because President Hácha's surrender to Germany was a violation of the constitution, refused to obey. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Mirror of National Subjugation: Over 10,000 Czechs Arrested</h3>
<p>Prague – According to sources here, since the German army invaded Czechoslovakia, the number of Czechs arrested by the Germans has reached 12,000. The number of Jews and Czech soldiers who have committed suicide in the past three days is very large. Now, wherever the German army has arrived in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia, it has fallen into a state of terror. (AP, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Troops Gather on the Czech-Hungarian Border</h3>
<p>Unfathomable Motives Cause Anxiety; Is It a Preparation for the Invasion of Hungary?</p>
<p>Prague – In the past two days, the number of German troops passing through this city has been very large, far exceeding the troops needed to occupy Moravia and Bohemia. Observers here are extremely worried, fearing that Germany will have some major military action. Some even said that if there is further military action, its target will be the Hungarian capital. For two months, Germans in Bratislava have been using "Long Live March 15" as a slogan, and now they have changed to "Long Live April." This slogan may be a signal to advance into the Hungarian capital, or it may not be known. It is said that German troops were once concentrated west of the Hungarian border a few weeks ago. The Hungarian government immediately inquired about the reason, and the German government replied that it was an exercise and immediately withdrew the troops. Although this news has not been confirmed, given the current situation, how can we know that Germany's intention is not on the Hungarian border, assessing the situation and considering it as a future attack step. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Bratislava – It is rumored here that the Slovak government will cede this city to Germany, and Hungary will return Košice (originally belonging to the Slovak province and assigned to Hungary in early November of last year) to this state for compensation. It is heard that Hungarian troops have begun to withdraw from the city. In addition, German troops have occupied most of the important cities of this state, and some have reached the suburbs of this city and are scheduled to enter the city in the evening. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Central European Region</p>
<p>Completely Transformed</p>
<p>Other Countries' Territories Are Violated; Hitler Does As He Pleases</p>
<p>Prague – Today's "Czech Capital Daily" stated that the entire Central European region will be transformed according to the political will of the Führer, and Bohemia is only one part of it. The newspaper also said that the borders near the German center that were in danger have now fallen and explained that the Germans have the right to occupy territories sufficient to accommodate their large population and cultural achievements. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, the borders of the Moravia and Bohemia protectorates and the Slovak state, the border between the state and the Carpathian Ukraine province, have not yet been formally delineated. It is heard that Germany has decided to order the protectorates to incorporate some areas into German territory and for the Slovak state to cede some areas as compensation. At the same time, some areas will be ceded from the Carpathian Ukraine province to compensate the Slovak state. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Czech Parties Merge into One</p>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler has instructed Czech Fascist leader General Gajda to merge the Czech parties into one according to totalitarian principles, with Czech President Hácha as the leader. Various institutions and organizations, such as the Bar Association and the General Federation of Trade Unions, have begun to exclude Jews.</p>
<p>In addition, according to news from Prague, former Czech Defense Minister General Syrový is still residing there and met with Führer Büttler yesterday. Rumors that he has fled to the UK are not accurate. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Slovak People Anxious</p>
<p>Břeclav – The Slovak people are all anxious about the future status of the state. People are buying large quantities of leather, textiles, and other goods, implying distrust of the Czech currency. Banks have been temporarily closed for three days. Although it has been decided to reopen today, withdrawals are restricted. All traffic in the country will be changed to driving on the left side of the road from today. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Japan Cheers</p>
<p>Congratulates Germany on the Success of the Invasion of Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>(Berlin) Ambassador Oshima telegraphed the German Foreign Minister (currently in Vienna), expressing congratulations on the annexation of Czechoslovakia, stating, "Your government has recently achieved unprecedented victory. I am now ordered by my Foreign Minister to extend my congratulations on behalf of my country. Your Führer Hitler's courageous decision is unparalleled and greatly beneficial to the pacification of the European situation and the establishment of world peace. Please convey this intention to your government." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany Appoints Neurath as Governor of the Bohemian-Moravian Protectorate</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler has appointed Privy Councilor and former Foreign Minister Neurath as the German Governor of Bohemia and Moravia. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is widely believed that former Czech President Hácha will be appointed President of the new protectorate, and General Gajda, the so-called "Czech Führer," will be appointed Prime Minister. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Feels Depressed</p>
<p>(Rome) Although Italian government officials have expressed joy after Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, considering the overall situation, the Italian side also feels depressed. When Germany and Austria merged, there were signs of anxiety here. Now, Germany did not consult the Italian government and directly placed the fait accompli of the annexation of Czechoslovakia before Italy. Therefore, it is conceivable that Italy, in the midst of forced smiles, inevitably feels a hidden pain in its heart. People generally say that Germany's actions are not aboveboard, so trust in Germany has naturally decreased sharply. Moreover, watching Germany's territory expand day by day and becoming the dominant force, Italy's future has also been threatened by its de facto threat. Moreover, Italy has repeatedly been disappointed in Central and Southeastern Europe, so it plans to develop elsewhere and seek compensation in the Mediterranean and Africa. However, the difficulties Italy will encounter in the Mediterranean are greater than the obstacles Germany encountered when expanding into Central Europe. Therefore, the Italian government is waiting for Germany to provide assistance to achieve its goals. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>French Government</p>
<p>Enabling Act</p>
<p>Expected to Pass the Chamber of Deputies; Opposition Motion Defeated</p>
<p>(Paris) The government's proposed enabling act was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion this morning. Opposition parties immediately proposed motions to oppose it. As a result of the discussion, the motion was defeated by 334 votes to 258, and it was decided to submit the original bill proposed by the government for a vote in the afternoon. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Daladier submitted a resolution to the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, requesting the Chamber to grant full military and other powers to deal with the European situation, which was reviewed and passed by the Chamber's Finance Committee by a vote of 26 to 17. (AP, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier immediately submitted a bill requesting that full powers be granted to the government to take various measures to strengthen France's strength. The bill was submitted for discussion tomorrow afternoon. Members of various parties then delivered speeches, condemning Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia and saying that the agreement signed by Führer Hitler was equal to waste paper and had no value. France must be united to cope with external threats and will never give up an inch of land. Socialist leader Blum said that national unity is a top priority, but he also criticized Prime Minister Daladier's current policies and asked the Prime Minister to step aside for the worthy. Communist member Béry also expressed the same opinion. Then Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech saying, "I now want to quickly strengthen the country's strength and take appropriate military measures so that the country can act quickly when necessary and not be weaker than the totalitarian countries." (All members cheered. At this time, the whole country must bury their heads in work.) "If my resignation is beneficial to the country, I will not cling to my position for a day, but if I firmly believe that the people want me to continue to work hard, I will stay in office. No matter whether other countries threaten us with force or deceive us with fraud, we will never give up the rights and land we possess. Our country has spared no major sacrifice to maintain peace for twenty years. Now, disappointed, we have to strengthen our strength to cope with the current crisis. We love peace, but we also love our country. Only with a country can we be free people and should do our best to serve it." (Government parties all stood up and cheered) Members of other parties also almost unanimously echoed. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany Makes Economic Demands on Romania</h3>
<p>Presented in the Manner of an Ultimatum; Denied by Romania</p>
<p>Bucharest – The claim that Germany has made economic demands on Romania has been denied by responsible parties and denounced as absurd. It is said that German-Romanian negotiations are proceeding in a friendly manner. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondents of The Times and the Daily Telegraph published a message today about Germany presenting Romania with an economic ultimatum. It is said that Huldtart, the leader of the German economic delegation in Romania, in the name of the German government, sent a memorandum to the Romanian government requesting: (1) Romania should issue an order to stop its efforts to transform Romania into an industrial country and limit itself to agriculture; (2) Germany should have complete patent rights to Romania's various exports, such as oil, grain, timber, cattle, and food, etc., and Germany will guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and the independence of its people in return. It is heard that this request has been completely rejected, and all Romanian political parties have therefore abandoned their differences and joined a common front. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Warsaw – According to news received here, when Hungarian troops advanced into Beregszász in Carpathian Ukraine, there was a fierce bloody battle with the Ukrainian "Sich" Defense Forces and the Czech army. After a bloody hand-to-hand combat, the town was occupied. According to statistics from Warsaw newspapers, the Ukrainian "Sich" Defense Organization has a total of 40,000 officers and soldiers, not including the Czech army. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – News has been received here that the Ukrainian militia is continuing to fight fiercely with Hungarian troops. Both sides are vying for the city of Sevľuš, which is very intense, winning and losing each time, a total of three times. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – According to today's collapsed newspaper, the Carpathian Ukraine's "Sich" Defense Organization is currently using the area near Kasyna and the Romanian border as its base to resist the invading Hungarian troops. Carpathian Ukraine's Prime Minister Vološin, before going to Romania, authorized Colonel Jefremov to be responsible for military command. Colonel Jefremov then made various arrangements and obtained the service of some Czech officers, preparing to fight to the death with the Hungarian army. It is heard that the Hungarian army has suffered setbacks in its advance, and in the east, it can only drag on to the vicinity of Kasyna. Ukraine is now concentrating its military power around Mount Pyetros, which is 7,000 feet high. The terrain can be used to give the Hungarian army a head-on blow. News from Khust states that only thirty people died and sixty were injured in the battle today. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Is Prepared and Fearless</h3>
<p>Military Strength Enhanced; Economic Self-Sufficiency; Enough to Give Provocateurs a Fatal Blow</p>
<p>(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party continued yesterday. Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee Kaganovich first delivered a speech, stating that the Federal Government and Stalin are working diligently with a clear goal, that is, to seek remedial methods for the backward sectors of the national economy to ensure that the Soviet Union maintains an independent position economically, is able to cope with the blockade without worry, and the army is fully equipped and confident of victory. It is now comforting to inform you that our country has already possessed this kind of power. Some kinds of our heavy industries have had important progress year by year since 1933, and the national defense industry is the most important. In addition, the efficiency of railway transportation has also doubled compared with 1933. When necessary, our army will definitely receive sufficient and swift supplies." At the meeting, many officers of the army, navy, and air force from various places attended the congress to express their respects to the party representatives. Among them, an army lieutenant who participated in the Zhanggufeng Incident spoke to the congress, saying, "Japanese samurai are arrogant and recklessly waged war last year. We immediately gave them a lesson. In the future, those who incite war will also be given the same lesson. In short, the ability of our nation will be displayed by our border guards." A naval officer then took the floor, saying that Stalin is very concerned about the navy, which is very grateful. Our cruisers, submarines, and torpedo boats in the Baltic Sea, the Pacific Ocean, and the Black Sea are heavily guarded, and safety can be guaranteed. A representative of the Air Force pilots then spoke, saying, "Our Air Force is the best in the world. When necessary, we will do our best to destroy those who incite war." Finally, representatives of the cavalry, mechanized units, and artillery successively spoke, all claiming the strength of the Soviet army. All the representatives at the meeting applauded warmly. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Soviet Development</p>
<p>Far East Fishing Industry Plan</p>
<p>(Moscow) People's Committee for Fisheries Minister Zhemtchuzhina (wife of People's Committee Chairman Molotov) today submitted a report on the Far East fishing industry development plan to the All-Union Congress, stating that this plan stipulates the construction of a large number of fishing boats, refrigerated ships, and cold storage, which will inevitably require the establishment of new bases in the Far East, such as Nikolayevsk, Vladivostok, Sakhalin Island, Khabarovsk, Petropavlovsk, and Komsomolsk. Among them, the cold storage in Khabarovsk, Petropavlovsk, and Komsomolsk should be completed quickly. In addition, 20 cold storage should be built along the coast of Primorsky Krai. It is generally believed that at a time when the fishery disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan have not been resolved, the Soviet government's active development of the Far East fishing industry is noteworthy. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Stalin's Report (Continued - Part 4)</h3>
<p>Stalin continued to state the various tasks of the Communist Party's domestic policy as follows:</p>
<p>First, to continue the policy of developing industry, increasing labor productivity, and improving production technology, so that the Soviet Union, having surpassed the major capitalist countries in production technology and industrial development rate, can further surpass them economically within the next ten to fifteen years; second, to continue the policy of developing agriculture and animal husbandry, so that within the next three to four years, the Soviet Union can produce 800 million poods of grain annually, increase the average yield to 12 to 13 quintals per hectare, increase the yield of industrial crops by an average of 30 to 35 percent, and increase the number of livestock, doubling the number of sheep and pigs, increasing cattle by 40 percent, and horses by 35 percent; third, to continue to improve the material and cultural living standards of workers, peasants, and intellectuals; fourth, to resolutely abide by the socialist constitution, thoroughly implement the democratization of domestic political life, strengthen the moral and political unity of Soviet society, and the harmonious cooperation of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, promote the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and cultivate and develop Soviet patriotism; fifth, to pay attention to the surrounding capitalist world, to pay attention to the fact that foreign spy agencies will continue to send spies, assassins, and saboteurs to infiltrate the Soviet Union, and to pay attention to strengthening socialist intelligence agencies to help them systematically crush and eradicate the enemies of the people.</p>
<p>Regarding internal party matters, Stalin pointed out that from the observation of political policies and daily practical work, this period is indeed a period of thorough victory for the Party's general line. After crushing the enemies of the people and purging the corrupt elements of the Party and Soviet organizations, the Party has become more unified politically and organizationally, and more united in supporting the Central Committee. Stalin particularly elaborated on the issue of selecting and promoting cadres, pointing out that the most important aspect in this regard is the bold and timely promotion of young and new cadres. Stalin said, "I believe that some members of our Party still do not fully understand this point. Some people believe that in selection, we should mainly rely on old cadres, while others, on the contrary, believe that we should mainly rely on young cadres. I believe that both are wrong. The question is not whether to rely on old cadres or new cadres, but to properly combine old and new cadres, so that they can blend together to guide the work of the Party and the country. One of the most important achievements of our Party in strengthening Party leadership in this period is the success of the line of combining old and new cadres from top to bottom in the selection of cadres. During this period, the Party has promoted more than 500,000 Party members and young Bolshevik elements close to the Party to national and Party leadership positions, of which more than 20 percent are women."</p>
<p>Stalin then discussed certain theoretical issues, general national issues, and special socialist national issues, as well as the issue of Soviet intellectuals. Stalin strictly criticized the following theory, namely, that the socialist state will wither away, because socialism has been mainly established in the Soviet Union, and the exploiting classes have been eliminated. Stalin pointed out that the creators of this theory underestimated the current international situation, underestimated the fact that the Soviet Union is surrounded by the capitalist world, and underestimated the importance of the bourgeois state and its agencies, because they are sending spies, assassins, and saboteurs to infiltrate the Soviet Union, and are waiting for an opportunity to launch a military attack on the Soviet Union. At the same time, this theory proves that its creators have underestimated the significance of the socialist state and its military, special, and intelligence agencies in defending the Soviet Union and resisting foreign aggression." Stalin continued to point out that since socialism has only triumphed in one country, and that country is surrounded by capitalist countries, there is always a danger of being subjected to military aggression, and that country must have a well-trained army, a tightly organized special agency, and a powerful intelligence agency, and must have its own powerful state apparatus to resist foreign aggression and defend itself. Stalin continued to point out that after the October Revolution, this socialist country experienced two main stages. The task in the first stage was to crush the overthrown classes, organize national defense to resist foreign aggression, restore industry and agriculture, and create conditions for eliminating the remnants of capitalism. The second stage was the period for thoroughly eliminating the remnants of capitalism until the complete victory of the socialist economic system and the adoption of a new constitution. In this stage, the role of domestic armed suppression has become a thing of the past, because the exploiters have been eliminated, and there is no one to suppress. Stalin said that the main tasks of the Soviet Union internally are now economic, organizational, cultural, and constructional peaceful work, while the targets of the army, special agencies, and intelligence agencies are not domestic, but foreign enemies. Stalin then mentioned the question of whether the state will be preserved in the communist era, answering, "Yes, if the capitalist encirclement has not been eliminated, and the threat of foreign military aggression has not been removed, the state will still be preserved." Stalin then discussed the issue of Soviet intellectuals, pointing out that although the Party's position on Soviet intellectuals is very clear, there is still a trend within the Party that is hostile to Soviet intellectuals, which is contrary to the Party's position. At this stage of Soviet development, intellectuals have fundamentally changed in composition and status, have become closely aligned with the people, and are therefore fundamentally different from the old bourgeois intellectuals. Stalin sternly rebuked Party workers who showed an unfriendly attitude towards intellectuals, elaborated on the importance of Soviet intellectuals, and demanded that a friendly and cooperative attitude be adopted towards intellectuals.</p>
<p>Finally, Stalin pointed out that the Soviet working class has proven in practice that the masses can work just as well without exploiters, proving that they can not only destroy the old system, but also build a new and better system, namely, the socialist system, a system free from panic and unemployment. The bourgeois elements of all countries have strongly claimed that peasants cannot take the socialist road, but the collective farmers of the Soviet Union have proven in practice that they can not only take this road, but also succeed greatly. At the end of the report, Stalin congratulated the working class, the collective farmers, the socialist intellectuals, all the harmonious nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After speaking, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. When Stalin stepped down from the podium, all the representatives and attendees cheered and paid their respects, warmly expressing their love and support. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Anti-Communist Axis: Japan Plans to Occupy Hainan Island for a Long Time</h3>
<p>To Invade French Territories in South China</p>
<p>Hong Kong Communication, March 14th, English-language Ta Mei Evening Post: According to an International News Service telegram released here, the Japanese army in Hainan Island has hired several German engineers and military experts to draft plans for the island's industry and defense. This may indicate that the Japanese army will</p>
<p>Occupy the island for a long time. The German military experts recently departed from Hong Kong for Haikou, the key port of Hainan Island, to carry out their work. It is reported that some German weapons and new military aircraft are also being unloaded in Haikou to strengthen the Japanese army's position on the island. According to well-informed sources here, the rumor that the Anti-Comintern Pact only unites against communism may be confirmed by this. They have also received</p>
<p>Alarming News from Chongqing regarding the Japanese army's conspiracy to occupy Hainan Island. According to this news, Germany, Italy, and Japan have agreed to strike against Britain and France in Europe and the Far East, supplying General Franco with large quantities of weapons and bombers to launch a sudden attack on France. Meanwhile, the German and Italian fleets in the Mediterranean would harass the British Navy, preventing it from sailing to the Far East. After seizing Hainan Island, Japan would use the island as a base to attack British and French colonies and concessions in South China, such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and Vietnam. Therefore, Japan brazenly invaded Hainan Island, but its axis allies did not implement the plan. This is because Franco suddenly</p>
<p>Changed his mind. Because British Prime Minister Chamberlain had convinced Franco that it would be more valuable to obtain British economic assistance than to conspire against British interests in Europe and the Far East. This conspiracy has failed. The Axis powers are quite disturbed by the premature demise of this conspiracy. This statement may have come from Chinese diplomatic circles overseas, and although it cannot be verified, its impact on South China is significant. Therefore, this intelligence is being critically examined here.</p>
<p>Huang Shaohong Leads Troops</p>
<p>Preparing for a Counteroffensive</p>
<p>Japanese Army Panicked in the Suburbs of Hangzhou</p>
<p>Hangzhou Communication: Huang Shaohong, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, convened a Western Zhejiang Guerrilla Military Conference on the 15th. As a result of the conference, it was decided that he would personally lead the troops of Liu Jianxu and Zhu Xi to launch a joint encirclement of Hangzhou. At the same time, Liu Zuhan, the former Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police Bureau, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Taihu Lake Water Guerrillas to coordinate operations. Therefore, in the past week, the Japanese army in Hangzhou has become increasingly busy with security in the suburbs of Hangzhou. Collecting materials and rushing to build gun emplacements and dig trenches in the areas of Chenghuang Mountain, Yuhuang Mountain, Jiuhua Mountain, Taohua Mountain, and Houchaomen. Mortar teams from Chuan Yuan are stationed in Mantou Mountain, Nanxing Bridge, and other places. Strong fortifications have been built in front of each camp gate. The puppet police department is registering West Lake yachts and designating the Hubin Pier as a mooring place. Except for two bridges, the Su Causeway has been cut off from traffic. The public is checked daily, and even their clothes are stripped off.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Fights Bravely in Counteroffensive, Continuing to Recapture Huaian and Funing</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo. The Japanese Army Transfers Back to Zhenjiang from Yangzhou</p>
<p>Taixian Communication: In recent days, the war in Northern Jiangsu has become more and more intense. A certain unit of the Chinese forces is fighting very bravely. The army first recaptured Siyang and Lianshui, and then surrounded Huaiyin and Huaian overnight. On the 10th, they recaptured the county seat of Huaian, and the Japanese army retreated to Huaiyin. The battle in Funing has also intensified. The Japanese army intends to open up the Tongyu Provincial Highway and actively invade southwards. A certain unit of the Chinese army, in coordination with the guerrilla forces, is blocking them closely. For days, they have been fighting bravely in the heavy rain, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese side then sent planes to bomb various towns in Yancheng and arbitrarily strafed fleeing civilians. As for Yangzhou and other places, the Japanese army has made no progress. On the 11th, the Chinese army again launched a fierce attack on the Japanese positions in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo, fighting fiercely through the night in the rain, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese headquarters in Yangzhou is now urgently requesting reinforcements from Zhenjiang. On the morning of the 10th, more than 400 reinforcements from Zhenjiang set off for Yangzhou to transfer to Shaobo to provide support. At 2:00 p.m., more than 100 Japanese soldiers crossed the river to Xiannvmiao to reinforce the Japanese soldiers in Xiannvmiao. The Japanese soldiers in Xiannvmiao are now forcibly sealing small carts and recruiting many civilian laborers, and their intentions are unclear. Also, on the 12th, it was confirmed that a certain division commander led his troops to recapture the county seat of Funing, and the entire Japanese army fled to Shuyang. According to an investigation, there are many bandit troops such as Li Shouxin and Liu Guitang in this invading Japanese army, and their strength is simply不堪一擊 (unable to withstand a single blow).</p>
<p>Chinese Guerrillas Attack Zhenjiang. The Chinese guerrilla forces in Jiangnan took advantage of the Japanese army's current attention to the war situation in Northern Jiangsu to launch a large-scale guerrilla war to strike the Japanese army, causing the Japanese side to be overwhelmed. At this moment, the guerrilla army has launched a fierce battle with the Japanese in the area of Zhenjiang. On the previous day, the Japanese Central China Army in Zhenjiang had transferred four or five hundred men to Yangzhou and Xiannvmiao in order to invade Gaoyou Zhaoguan Dam to provide support. The Japanese army in Northern Jiangsu suddenly heard this news and suddenly returned to Zhenjiang on the 11th and 12th. On the 12th, dozens of cavalrymen also crossed the river from Yangzhou to Zhenjiang, dragging two heavy artillery pieces with them. The situation was unusually hurried and flustered. For a time, the situation in Jiangbei also became relatively relaxed.</p>
<p>The Army Forcibly Drafts Laborers On the Spot. Because of the difficulty in replenishing troops domestically, the Japanese side had set up recruitment offices in the Zhenjiang area last year to lure young people in the guerrilla areas to serve as puppet soldiers. However, the young people in various places were all deeply aware of righteousness, and the Japanese side had no way to do anything. Starting from this month, they began to check households in various cities and towns in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, forcibly conscripting them into the army. The situation is extremely tense. At present, most of the young people in the cities and towns of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou have fled to other places out of fear. The Japanese headquarters has ordered the heads of each baojia (administrative unit) to be responsible for retrieving them, and has tightened the defense of the city gates. All men between the ages of 16 and 45 are only allowed to enter, not to exit. The Yangzhou Japanese Yi Fu Ban (pacification unit) has also notified the puppet organization of the county, limiting them to demolish the civilian houses outside Nantou within a few days to build a large-scale training ground.</p>
<p>Chinese Army in Nanhui</p>
<p>Repels Japanese Army</p>
<p>Pudong Communication: At 7:00 a.m. on the 10th, hundreds of Japanese soldiers attacked Nanhui County by land and water from Zhuqiao. At that time, the defenders of the city were Li Wenyuan of the First Battalion and Tao Zengzhi of the Third Battalion of the Fourth Detachment of the Zhongyi Jiuguo Army (Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army) under Yu Taosheng. Seeing the arrival of the Japanese army, they were immediately directed by Captain Li Wenyuan to guard the four gates and resist bravely. The Japanese army used small steel cannons and machine guns to concentrate their firepower, and although the attack was fierce, they were ultimately unable to make any progress due to the solid city walls and the dedicated defense of the soldiers. Detachment Commander Yu Taosheng immediately ordered Deputy Commander Zhai Pengkui to lead a special service battalion to outflank the left wing, the Fourth and Sixth Battalions to attack the right wing, and the Bao Wei Tuan (Defense Corps) to attack the rear. After a fierce battle of more than four hours, the Chinese encirclement troops were getting closer and closer, charging and fighting hand-to-hand, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing many weapons. This was an unprecedented victory in the Pudong guerrilla warfare. The Shanghai gentry from Pudong are planning to慰勞 (comfort and reward) the troops.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Social Service Center Handles Traveler Registration</h3>
<p>Qujiang Communication: The Guangdong Provincial Social Service Center, in view of the fact that many people have been displaced since the outbreak of the war in South China, often sees notices in newspapers and busy streets of transportation hubs seeking missing persons. However, this has had little effect. In order to facilitate people from all walks of life to easily inquire about the news of relatives and friends, a Traveler Communication Registration Office was established on March 1st in the Personnel Consulting Office of the center to handle the matter. People from all walks of life, if they arrive in Shaoguan (i.e., Qujiang County) or leave the country, and want to make it easier for relatives and friends to inquire, can register their communication address at the center. At the same time, a Traveler Inquiry Office was established at the Qujiang Station of the Yuehan Railway. Any merchants and travelers who arrive in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province for the first time and are unfamiliar with the place and various situations and need to inquire, the center is responsible for providing guidance and various conveniences. Since its establishment, it has been convenient for merchants and travelers, and they do not feel difficulty even if they are unfamiliar with the place.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Opium Public Sales</h3>
<p>Puppet County Office Forcibly Conscripts Laborers</p>
<p>Qingpu Communication: The Qingpu puppet county office, recently realizing that the Japanese army stationed in Qingpu is weak, in order to curry favor and benefit itself, forcibly conscripts laborers to organize the Bao Wei Tuan (Defense Corps) to deal with the guerrilla teams in the surrounding villages. It ordered the puppet baojia (administrative unit) heads to be responsible for the conscription, with 30 people as a small squad and three small squads as a large squad. Each large squad is led by six to twelve Japanese soldiers and will be stationed in various towns in the suburbs after the conscription is completed. Each town must pay a monthly 保衛捐 (defense donation), stipulated to be from 30 yuan per village, 50 yuan per township, and 100 yuan per town. Wang Daoxing, the puppet director of the Qingpu Unified Tax Bureau, and Xu Bainian, the puppet director of the Finance Bureau, have been dismissed one after another. They contacted a group of local ruffians and established more than 30 opium sales and smoking dens in various places in the city and suburbs. In the Tang family residence in the Yuhang Bridge area in the city, a special goods store was set up, openly selling drugs. The puppet county office collects taxes from each sales and smoking den on a monthly basis.</p>
<h3>Picturesque Scenery: Song Zheyuan Recuperates in Yangshuo</h3>
<p>County Magistrate's Paltry Salary Makes for a Meager Life; Zhang Guoquan Discusses Li Bai's Valor in Battle</p>
<p>From a Regular Correspondent in Yangshuo</p>
<p>Yangshuo Correspondence, February: It is precisely the season when the rains return to the southern lands. At the invitation of an international friend stationed in Guilin, I stole away for a visit to Yangshuo. The car drove out of Guilin's south gate, heading towards the road to Yangshuo. The suburbs of Guilin and the mountain mists gradually dissolved into the heavy morning fog. Damp clouds in the sky pushed out from the dense peaks, drifting like fathers traveling to another group of mountains and forests. Sometimes they brought a misty drizzle, sometimes accompanied by slightly cold droplets of water. A thin layer of yellow mud floated on the highway. Some shallow bumps reflected the mountain shadows, occasionally causing the heavy car tires to splash up yellow, muddy water. The busy wartime transport gave the highway a sense of hardship. From both sides of the road, farmland and pine forests extended directly to the nearby foothills. If it was a loess hill, then the hardworking Guangxi farmers would cultivate the land from the foot of the hill to the mountainside. The crops, which could not be seen clearly, were firmly facing the wind and rain. Nearby, rapeseed flowers, like gold scattered on the ground, swept past the car in large patches. The broad beans in the paddy fields had also blossomed with purple petals. This was just like the rural scene of late spring in Jiangnan, evoking the homesickness of this Jiangnan native. The car caught up with the First Regiment of Guangxi Student Soldiers who had departed from Guilin to work in the south. These more than one thousand young men and women, after three months of training in Guilin, were now going to mobilize and organize the people of the south, preparing to defend the country and protect the people when necessary. Fully armed, they marched on the muddy roadside and in the fields. This green youth team was treading the battlefield to protect the mountains and fields behind them. From Guilin to Yangshuo is sixty-four kilometers, or one hundred and twenty Chinese miles. The closer to Yangshuo, the more one felt a clear distinction between Yangshuo and the mountains near Guilin. The mountains of Guilin are undeniably strange, their strangeness lies in the stone, while the mountains of Yangshuo are mostly draped in a thorny cloak, lush and green, concealing the rugged rocks, especially showing a kind of ancient and elegant demeanor. The highway, within thirty or twenty miles north of Yangshuo, almost winds back and forth between the strange rocks.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Governance: Yangshuo is bordered by the Li River to the east, and surrounded by layered mountain peaks on the west, north, and south sides. The county town is limited by the mountains and rivers, and the area may not even reach four square miles. The population is only over three hundred families. Apart from the market days on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month, there is no commerce to speak of. The Baisha Market eighteen miles north of the county town, the Fuli Market in the southeast, and the Xingping Market thirty to forty miles northeast surround it. These market towns have several times more people than the county town, and have livelier streets that the county town lacks. They make the county town isolated and desolate. I met with County Magistrate Zhu Mo and Deputy County Magistrate Liu Biguang several times. They maintained the simplicity and sincerity of Guangxi administrative officials. The county magistrate, in the past, and even now outside of Guangxi, is still the "lord of a hundred miles," the so-called "parent official," but County Magistrate Zhu's monthly salary is 150 Guangxi dollars (75 legal currency). Although the government stipulates that the county magistrate can get one percent of the reward from the land tax revenue each year, he is, after all, a county magistrate, with many unavoidable expenses and social engagements. Therefore, he is still unable to bring his family from his hometown in Hubei to Yangshuo. Currently, the county government's monthly office expenses are only 200 yuan. The cost of lamp oil alone is more than 100 yuan, which forces him to restrict the hours the county government lights are on. He often has to instruct the clerks to save on paper and pens to balance income and expenses. From this, I believe that his life is hard. Yangshuo County is full of mountains and few villages, a poor fourth-class county with an annual balanced income and expenditure of 120,000 yuan. The largest income is the land tax surcharge. The land surcharge and local product tax account for three-tenths, and public property income accounts for one-tenth. Administrative and education expenses each account for three and seven-tenths of the total expenditure. There is one county high school, over forty central primary schools, and over one hundred and sixty primary schools. According to County Magistrate Zhu, there are no school-age children out of school in the county. Adult education is also actively promoted, and the illiteracy rate has been reduced to the lowest number. Comparatively, the illiteracy rate among women is still higher than that of men, because Guangxi women work longer hours than men. As for the rural women living in remote mountains and poor valleys, there are more inconveniences in both promoting and receiving education, but in general, it can be said that illiteracy has been eliminated. The county has sent over one thousand men to war, and there are still over seventeen thousand reserve soldiers under the age of thirty and thirty thousand under the age of ten, all of whom have been trained by the village chiefs and know basic tactical knowledge. Deputy County Magistrate Liu is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. His hair is already gray, but he still retains the spirit of a young soldier. I saw him braving the rain to give a speech to six companies of militia in the public sports field. Those militia members were recommended by the villages, five from each village. They provided their own guns, ammunition, and clothing, and brought their own food to the county to receive a month of guerrilla warfare training, and then brought what they had learned back to teach the other able-bodied men who had received ordinary military training. When Deputy County Magistrate Liu led me to visit their dormitory, I felt that they got along like family members. What impressed me most was that Yangshuo County now has several guerrilla warfare bases. Those projects were completed under the guidance of the two county magistrates in cooperation with the people.</p>
<p>A Landscape Like a Painting: I did not have much time to enjoy the Li River by boat, so I could only wander around the suburbs with a cane. Guangxi Province originally had a plan to develop Yangshuo into a scenic area. Yangshuo County also had an organization to manage and construct the scenic area. In fact, the scenery of Yangshuo does not need any further "construction." The so-called construction is just to add some pavilions and terraces to the cliffs and bays. After County Magistrate Zhu took office, in view of the fact that both the province and the county had no surplus funds to carry out everything, he was preparing to invite celebrities at home and abroad to donate money for construction, and name the buildings after them to commemorate them. However, after the Lugou Bridge Incident, this matter could only be postponed until after the victory. In the valley west of the city and east of the highway, the two hundred-foot-high Old Man Mountain and the Solitary Beauty Peak stand like bonsai. Around the two strange peaks, the prototype of Yangshuo Park has been completed. Old Man Mountain is only a few hundred steps around. At the foot of the mountain, there are caves that can be traversed and a "Stream Viewing Terrace" from which one can overlook. Climbing up the mountain on the steep and winding stone steps, there is a pavilion halfway up called "Meeting Immortals," probably because it faces a cracked human-shaped rock. The top of the mountain is less than two square feet, and there is a pavilion called "Gathering Talents," from which one can have a panoramic view of the city. The highway, close at hand, meanders softly into the narrow valley of Ma'anshan. In the distance, the flowing water of the Li River quietly reflects the undulating mountain shadows. Opposite, several mountain crows, with an air of being independent from the world, fly and perch on the Solitary Beauty Peak that cannot be climbed. It is truly a landscape like a painting. Bilian Cave is the largest stone cave in Yangshuo, with stalactites stacked upon each other, deep, dark, and grand. The north entrance is being renovated by stone workers hired by Song Zheyuan, who is recuperating in Yangshuo, and the four characters "Zhong Shan Xian Ji" (Gathering of All Virtues) are engraved on the cave wall. It can accommodate hundreds of people to avoid air raids. The scenery along the Li River is relatively bright and open, with a small stone road rising and falling southward, leaning against the cliffs above and facing the rapid currents below. The river water from the north turns here, colliding with the stone bank and forming countless whirlpools, creating patches of white foam that slowly dissipate along with the flowing water until it reaches the "Paoshui Ferry" crossing. Someone has written a large character "Dai" (Belt) on the cliff, which is a vivid depiction of the Li River passing through Yangshuo.</p>
<p>Visiting Song Zheyuan: In the past, standing at the entrance of the Ma'anshan valley, one could see a large area of sugarcane fields and a local sugar mill on the west bank of the Li River. Now, part of the sugarcane field is surrounded by a new bamboo fence. Under a few tall palm trees, three single-story houses are scattered on the land. That is "Jinde New Village," and every resident of Yangshuo knows that it is General Song Zheyuan's villa. Walking through the fence gate, bypassing a row of bamboo screens, is a small hall, with a guard room and a garage on both sides. Turning a bend, one sees a guard carrying a holster and holding the famous broadsword of the Twenty-Ninth Army. He handed my business card to Song's chief secretary, Gao Zihou, who immediately extended his welcome. After ending his mission as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the First War Zone, Song had recuperated in Hengshan for some time. In the second half of last year, he bought land here and built a house because he loved the mountains and rivers of Yangshuo. He is now suffering from mild hemiplegia and can only barely walk in the garden. His family watches over him, and politely declines visits from guests on his behalf. Chief Gao is a rigorous Shandong man who once served as the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. We had a very pleasant conversation. People who have lived in the north for a long time are not used to the humid climate in the mountains of Yangshuo, where the sun has not been seen for months, but wandering in the mountains and rivers in the morning and evening, apart from the busy schedule of war, is not without its pleasures. According to Chief Gao, "Song has recently taken up the post of member of the Military Affairs Commission in Yangshuo, and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang for leave. As soon as he recovers, he will go to Chongqing to attend meetings. In addition to Madam Song, his sons and daughters, and several secretaries and clerks, there are more than sixty guards here. Song sometimes gives speeches to his subordinates, hoping that they will become useful to the country. Song is currently taking Chinese medicine and is expected to recover in a month, which should be enough." Song gets up at eight in the morning and rests around ten in the evening. His daily life consists of writing, reading scriptures, and taking walks. The new village covers more than thirty mu, and the land cost more than one thousand yuan. Although Song cannot live in Yangshuo for a long time, the construction of the houses is still very solid, costing more than one thousand yuan each. In the future, he plans to give this new village to the county government as local property. Song is fifty-six years old this year. When Chief Gao sent me out of the village, I caught a glimpse of him wearing casual clothes, holding a cane, and chatting with his wife and daughters in the courtyard. He looked very healthy. Song is very optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. He believes that Wu Peifu will never be fooled. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Eight Thousand Fans Cheer Enthusiastically: Lido Wins the Scott Cup</h3>
<p>Defeats the Westerners 4-3 with a Wonderful Performance, Only Glorious Achievement of This Year's Football Season</p>
<p>The Lido football team, with an extremely wonderful performance, perfect cooperation, and a fierce battle of ninety minutes yesterday, finally defeated the fierce Westerners 4-3 in the final, regaining the Scott Cup that had been separated from the Chinese for years. In the first half, Lido took the lead with 4-2. Yesterday, the weather was sunny and the more than eight thousand spectators at the amusement park cheered like thunder. After the game, Mr. Borge, the acting chairman of the Western Football Association, personally awarded the Scott Cup, which had been held by the British Army Doum team, to Lido captain Li Yichen, and delivered a congratulatory speech. According to the Scott Cup, which has been held since 1902, only in 1935 and 1936 did Donghua hold it for two consecutive years. The rest were all held by Western teams. Since it fell to the French Chamber of Commerce in 1937, it fell into the hands of the British Army Doum last year. This season, Lido, with the qualification of a C-level team, defeated strong enemies and won the championship, winning a lot of glory for the Chinese.</p>
<h3>Besieging the Westerners' Goal</h3>
<p>— (Photo by Zhang Hong)</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Decides the Winner: Yesterday, the two sides were evenly matched, with many wonderful moments. Lido's Xu Wenkui performed the best, and he deserves the first credit. Li Yichen also worked very hard. Cao and Zhang on the wings had good constructions from time to time. Zhang Mingsheng's corner kicks were accurate and unparalleled. Wang Kehou was less impressive. The center back line was not strong. Sun Jinshun was stationed at the rear, repeatedly saving dangerous balls, with more merit than demerit. Zhang Lingen was still barely satisfactory. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen still inevitably had a tendency to carelessness. Westerner goalkeeper Willie's performance was far above Zhongen's. His position was particularly good. The four goals conceded were really difficult to save. The center and back guards were all abnormal, and the ball was often kicked to the rear, and loopholes frequently appeared. The key to failure lies in this. Forward Qian is still called active. The central forward's shots were very fierce. Right winger Hutlai had many brilliant moments. Left winger Huo Gengsheng already felt old and weak. Lido's victory did not come easily.</p>
<p>Each Score One Goal: The Westerners attacked first, with Huisihute kicking remotely. Changjiaolu received the ball and passed it forward. Wang Kehou dribbled the ball and approached, passing it to Cao Qiuting. Cao hooked towards the center. Turner pulled his foot to save, and the ball flew backwards. Willie jumped up and pressed it down, avoiding a major mistake. Fengdu sent troops to attack the enemy camp. The Westerners saved a corner kick. Zhang Mingsheng kicked it in. The angle was very good. Willie patted it out not far. Cao Qiuting caught up and hooked a shot, directly rushing into the bottom of the net, opening the record, five minutes after the start of the game. Jinshun fouled, and Tefe kicked two free kicks in a row from twenty yards away, both missing. Xu Wenkui got a pass from Zhang Mingsheng and picked it up, but Wang Kehou failed to intercept it and also missed a good opportunity. At the tenth minute, Tefe came from the middle, picking up Hutlai. Hu hooked in, and Greenburg took a shot, and the ball entered the bottom corner. Changjiaolu did not save it, and it became a tie.</p>
<p>Xu and Wang Both Make Contributions: The Westerners launched another attack. Hutlai hooked and sent it to Greenburg. Greenburg shot without waiting for the ball to stop, flying over the horizontal bar. Lido advanced, Xu Wenkui passed to Li Yichen, who was blocked, and passed it back to Wenkui. Wenkui passed to Zhang Mingsheng again. Zhang hooked in, and Wang Kehou headed it out of bounds. The ball was kicked out of the Westerners' goal area. Tefe passed to Hutlai, who missed the opportunity. Xu Wenkui got the ball and dribbled forward, showing his skills, picking up the ball. Turner panicked and kicked it into a corner kick. Zhang Mingsheng kicked it in. Turner headed it out. Xu added another header, which was caught by Willie. Soon Lido got another corner kick opportunity. Zhang Mingsheng repeated his old trick. Xu Wenkui headed fiercely from sixteen yards away, making a contribution. Unexpectedly, only two minutes later, Zhang Mingsheng hooked in, and Wang Kehou entered the net with the ball and man. Lido took the lead with 3-1.</p>
<p>Westerners Are at a Disadvantage: The Westerners counterattacked. Peida shot hard, and Zhongen punched it out. Cao and Wang advanced together, passing it to Zhang Mingsheng, who shot with his left foot, but did not score. The Westerners counterattacked. Tielitui saved the ball carelessly, kicking it into the hinterland. Peida lightly passed it to Hutlai, who passed it to Greenburg again. Greenburg's shot was too soft. Zhongen lay down and扑住了。离上半场休息仅五分钟，活更生从左窜进，妙钧门前，培特额角有眼，西捕卒夺回一球。继培达得杰勃逊遥送，铁腿出阻落空，培于十码处攻门幸偏斜未中。李义臣高射敌门，威利扑空再扑，始吿脱险。迨上半场终了前一分钟，曹秋亭主开角球，李义臣顶上开花，亦得一功，上半时丽都以四对二佔先。</p>
<p>Lido Wins the Silver Cup: Changing sides to fight again, within a minute, Hutlai, with lightning speed, dribbled to the baseline and crossed. Zhongen touched it, and the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Greenburg stepped forward and greeted it, touching it into the door. The Westerners had already created a situation of 3 to 4, only one goal behind, and the attack was more urgent. The Westerners' hinterland was full of enemy cavalry. Huo Gengsheng got the ball kicked by Sun Jinshun, rushed forward and hooked it in. Zhongen was tall and hugged the ball out of danger. Peiter got Hutlai's pass and swept angrily, fortunately hitting the goalpost. Lido saw that the situation was not good and changed from defense to attack. Wenkui fired, and Willie lay down and扑住了滑去。迨义臣冲上，球巳被威利将身压住。杰勃逊远射，格林堡头顶，均被钟恩救出。卅六分钟，王克厚得李义臣派司，传递许文奎，许杀入禁区无人来挡，怪脚起处，竟吿偏逸，西捕虽极图挣扎，无奈心餘力绌，时间吿终，丽都以叫对三荣膺冠军。</p>
<h3>International Cup Soccer Final Today: Scotland vs. Portugal</h3>
<p>Group A Donghua to Play French Chamber of Commerce Again; Kickoff at 10:30 AM at Amusement Park</p>
<p>In this year's International Cup soccer match, Scotland and Portugal will face off in the final at the racecourse at 3 PM today. The two teams are evenly matched, and the outcome is difficult to predict. In this year's Chinese team, participating under the name of the Chinese United Team, unfortunately lost 0-5 to the Portuguese team in the semi-finals, resulting in a Westerner world in the final. In today's league, Group A Donghua will meet the French Chamber of Commerce again. In the first round, Donghua was defeated 0-2. I don't know if they can avenge their previous defeat today. In the reserve group, Donghua will play the Westerners. If Donghua wins, there is only one game left against St. Francis, and the championship is almost guaranteed. In addition, there are two games in Group B and one game in Group C. For the Chinese team in Group B, Qinghua will play the British Navy. The rest are empty. The order for today is as follows: Scotland vs. Portugal (International Final) 3:00 PM Pan Tuo Racecourse Donghua Club vs. French Chamber of Commerce (Group A) 10:30 AM Shen Huichun Amusement Park Westerners vs. Donghua (Reserve Group) 3:00 PM Fadafu Jiaozhou Park Qinghua Club vs. British Navy (Group B) 9:00 AM Feiert Jiaozhou Park (Reserves) Sun Huizhang, Lin Dianhua, Liao Yongxu</p>

<p>The Dismissal of Sichuan Education Director Yang Lian</p>
<p>The Truth of Being Detained and Investigated in Chongqing</p>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) Sichuan Education Director Yang Lian, because of problems with the examination expenses of more than seventy yuan during his tenure in the Anhui Education Department, was recorded with a major demerit on file. This decision was made while the transfer procedures in Anhui were not completed, and financial entanglements arose again, and he even kept as many as four concubines. Recently, he cohabited with a female staff member of the Sichuan Education Department. His wives and concubines rushed to Chengdu, making a scene at the Education Department. The Changju Bureau found out. Yang Lian came to Chongqing on February 25 to attend a certain training class, and was detained at Nanwenquan in Chongqing. The Executive Yuan held its 403rd meeting at 4 p.m. on February 28 and passed a resolution to dismiss him from his position and investigate him. The vacancy will be filled by Guo Youshou, a senior secretary of the Ministry of Education, a native of Sichuan. The appointment was announced one day, and Guo left Chongqing for Chengdu on March 10 to take office.</p>

<h3>Soy Bean Industry Announcement: Suppressing Private Transactions</h3>
<p>Implementing Regulations on April 1st, Making Every Effort to Dredge Grain Sources</p>
<p>After seven groups including the soybean industry formed a grain evaluation committee, the committee has sent personnel to investigate the total amount of rice stored in the city, evaluate the market price of rice at any time, and make every effort to dredge the sources. The market announced to suppress private transactions, and those who violate it will be punished. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suppression of Private Transactions in the Market</p>
<p>The Soybean Industry Association announced in the market that in order to ensure the stability of the business of all parties, the association has repeatedly stipulated that the photos should be affixed to the admission cards of all brokers and salespersons, and advised non-members to organize formal firms. The above methods have been announced and implemented successively. Now, the scope of business of brokers and the methods of guarantee and punishment are discussed and decided as follows. The seal of the broker's guarantee firm must be affixed with the official firm's seal, and a deposit of 20 yuan must be paid. The business scope of the broker shall be limited to selling to firms of the same industry in the market. In the future, those who engage in private transactions shall be punished. The penalties are as follows: (1) Those who violate the regulations for the first time shall be fined 20 yuan in national currency, the second time shall be fined 50 yuan, and the third time the person's admission card will be revoked. The fines shall be paid in full within three days, and if overdue, the deposit will be used to offset the amount. If the amount is insufficient, the guarantor shall be responsible for making up the difference. (2) Half of all fines shall be used for charitable donations and half shall be used as rewards for reporters. The above measures will be implemented from April 1st of this year. It is imperative to record and announce it, and all brokers and their guarantor shall abide by it. This is very important and hereby announced.</p>
<p>Allocation of Stored Rice and Dredging Sources</p>
<p>The Grain Evaluation Committee has designated Jin Shiquan to investigate the amount of rice stored in various rice firms and warehouses in the city as a reference for evaluating the price of rice. As soon as the investigation form is printed, it will be started immediately. The rice price evaluated by the committee must be uniformly observed by all firms, and those who violate it will be severely punished. At the same time, measures will be taken to suppress hoarding and manipulation. As for the rice and grain in the producing areas, after the various groups advised the vendors to purchase, the goods have been arriving in recent days, and the market price of rice has dropped. However, yesterday it was rumored in the market that the Japanese puppets controlled the food in their occupied areas and stopped issuing permits for moving goods from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. At the same time, Wuhu prohibited the transportation of rice and grain to Shanghai, which caused the market price of rice to suddenly rebound by one corner. However, the above rumors remain to be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Arrests German Ship Passengers Again</h3>
<p>Six People Arrested in Two Days, All by Japanese Personnel</p>
<p>Liulu Bao reports that according to responsible sources yesterday (17th), six Chinese people were arrested by Japanese personnel active in the Public Concession in each of the past two days. It is reported that three of them were passengers on the German ship Hanna, and were arrested on the ship when the ship was about to dock at the Bund of the French Concession. The other three were reportedly arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Police at the request of the Japanese side and handed over to the Japanese side yesterday. A team of plainclothes Japanese personnel boarded the Hanna for a search. It is believed that these Japanese people belong to the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces. After they arrested the three Chinese people on board, they took a motorboat and sailed to Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson's Suiwo Steamer Damaged by Izumo Battleship</h3>
<p>Suiwo Entered Port Izumo Headed Straight, Gun Barrel Touched Second Deck, Deck Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Yangtze River steamer Suiwo, with a deadweight of more than 2,000 tons, has been sailing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Xingan, Zhanghuanggang, Niantuo Port, Hupu and other ports since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the blockade of the Yangtze River. Yesterday, the ship came to Shanghai from Zhanghuanggang and Niantuo Port, loaded with war pigs, cattle, chickens, eggs and other goods. When it entered port at about 2 p.m., it saw the Japanese warship Izumo heading straight at it when it passed the Yushichang Poomian at 2:30 p.m. The Izumo left the Mitsubishi Wharf at the northern end of Baidu Bridge at 2 o'clock and was about to leave the port. When the two ships met there, the Suiwo</p>
<p>Saw the Izumo Heading Straight</p>
<p>It was extremely dangerous, so it sounded a whistle to give way. Unexpectedly, there was a Japanese small transport ship on the right, with its bow facing the west bank and its stern facing east, lying across the river, so it could not give way to the right. It quickly stopped, but the Japanese warship still sailed straight down. The Suiwo slightly moved its bow to the right to block it, and the Japanese warship sailed past on the left. The warship was equipped with gun emplacements on both sides, and the gun barrels</p>
<p>Exposed Outside the Hull</p>
<p>Therefore, when passing the Suiwo, the gun barrel touched the second deck of the Suiwo, and the left side of the plank berth and the two rooms of the account room and officer's cabin in the steerage passenger cabin were scratched by the muzzle of the gun, and completely damaged. The railings and iron pillars on the side of the ship were also knocked down. A Taiping sampan on the upper deck was also damaged, and a passenger was slightly injured in the head. After the accident, the Suiwo sailed to Shanghai as usual and docked at the Bund Wharf of Beijing Road at about 3 p.m. The crew immediately</p>
<p>Reported to the Company</p>
<p>After the Izumo damaged the Suiwo, it also docked at the Junpu Bureau Wharf near Wusong to see if the ship was damaged. It is said that after receiving the report, the manager and chief shipowner of Jardine Matheson went to the Izumo to negotiate. The outcome is unknown. The Suiwo was originally scheduled to leave port this morning, but due to the serious damage, it needs to be repaired and will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bombing Foreign Industries Triggers Serious Accusations</h3>
<p>Western Reporters Ask Questions, Japanese Representatives Equivocate</p>
<p>The mainland reported that at the reception for reporters held by the Japanese side last night (17th), reporters questioned the Japanese planes' attacks on Nanchang and Pingjiang. The Japanese spokesman replied that the foreign flags and marks placed on buildings adjacent to Chinese military institutions had no value, and even if they did, they were very small. A reporter asked the spokesman to provide details of the attack on Pingjiang. At that time, a long discussion began about Japanese pilots bombing foreign industries.</p>
<p>The spokesman replied that we have not received further details, and the army spokesman was absent. He did not know that there were Chinese military institutions near the US Methodist Church school bombed on Wednesday. A reporter asked whether Japanese air force reconnaissance personnel had discovered any British industries in Pingjiang marked with flags or marks. The spokesman replied that he had not received any news that foreign industries had been bombed during the air raid on Wednesday, so this question was not valid. The reporter who asked the question replied that he was not asking whether</p>
<p>There Are Foreign Industries</p>
<p>Was bombed, just asking whether the authorities knew about the foreign industries in Pingjiang. The spokesman replied that there was no news. In reply to another question, he said that the Japanese army and navy authorities consulted the maps provided by the foreign consulates before starting the attack. However, these maps were not very detailed, so the Japanese side repeatedly asked the foreign authorities to provide detailed information about the location of foreign industries. A reporter asked, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated that the destroyed industries were not clearly marked, so foreign industries</p>
<p>How Should It Be Marked</p>
<p>So that it will not be bombed? The spokesman replied that this matter needs to be investigated, and the weather conditions are very different. A reporter asked, why did the Japanese side destroy three clearly marked American industries in three air raids? The spokesman replied that Chinese troops often set up military institutions near foreign industries, and said that there was an air raid shelter for General Chiang Kai-shek under the Central Bank Building in Hankou. A reporter asked,</p>
<p>Is General Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>A military target? He also asked whether there were any military targets near the British Church industries in Pingjiang. The spokesman replied that since it had not been heard that the foreign industries in Pingjiang had been damaged, these questions did not need to be discussed. A reporter asked, there are four American industries in Yichang, and three of them were bombed. This is a special example, and we would like to know the details. The spokesman replied, we have not received sufficient information, but it is possible that anti-aircraft fire forced the Japanese plane to fly high. A reporter asked, did the Japanese side not say that the air raid on Yichang</p>
<p>Did Not Encounter Anti-Aircraft Guns</p>
<p>The spokesman replied that it was the first time, and the Japanese plane was attacked by anti-aircraft guns during other air raids. A reporter said that in one air raid, American industries were hit by seventeen bombs, four of which nearly hit the 20-foot-long American flag. The spokesman replied that if this was true, it would need to be investigated. The reporter again mentioned the American industries in Yichang.</p>
<p>During an Air Raid</p>
<p>Being hit by seventeen bombs, he said that this was either indiscriminate bombing or the bomber's skills were poor. The spokesman replied to other questions that bombing could not be accurate if the weather was not clear. All these problems require further study, but as mentioned above, the only target of Japanese bombers is the military.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Secretly Sets Up Plainclothes Headquarters in Concession</h3>
<p>Concession Authorities Pay Serious Attention, But Japanese Side Vigorously Denies</p>
<p>Modern News Agency reports that according to reliable sources on the foreign side, the Japanese side, on the pretext of preventing terrorist incidents in the concession, has set up a plainclothes headquarters in a certain hotel on Hankou Road since the establishment of an agreement with the Public Works Department, and has recruited a large number of ruffians to engage in investigation and arrest work. The concession authorities learned of the matter and believed that the Japanese side's move was completely illegal and had no basis in the signed agreement, and obviously hindered the administration of the concession, so they negotiated with the Japanese side to ban it. However, the Japanese side vigorously denied that there was an incident of setting up a plainclothes headquarters, and said that the rooms opened in a certain hotel were entirely for entertainment and recreation, and there was no other purpose. At present, the concession authorities are still paying serious attention to this and investigating all its actions.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th Birthday Today</h3>
<p>Fudan Alumni Association to Hold Celebration Tonight at Xin Xin</p>
<p>Today is Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday. The Fudan University Alumni Association, as Mr. Ma is the founder of the school, is celebrating his longevity, and has decided to hold a celebration at the Xin Xin Restaurant on Guizhou Road at 6 p.m. today. Those who wish to join can request temporarily. The association will also publish a special issue celebrating Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday and distribute it to the participants. Outsiders can also send a letter to the association to request it. Mr. Ma recently sent a letter to the association saying, "To my fellow Fudan students, I have learned from the newspaper that your association will hold a celebration in Shanghai for my 100th birthday, which shows that you have not forgotten me from afar. However, since the outbreak of the war, the country has been in turmoil and the people have been struggling. Why should an old man like me be wandering in a foreign land? I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and merit, and I am afraid of living a long and disgraceful life. I am ashamed to be celebrated. Thinking back to the establishment of your school, talents have emerged in large numbers, excelling in all fields. You have both devoted yourselves to self-cultivation and vowed to govern the country. I am truly honored. I would like to express my gratitude and wish you all progress in your studies. Your elder, Xiangbo." Mr. Xiangbo's recent photo and original letter are printed above to express our admiration.</p>
<h3>Members of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee Appointed</h3>
<p>Including Hao Shumin and Tang Shoumin, Among Five People, The Committee Decides on Capital Operations</p>
<p>In order to equalize foreign exchange and maintain the value of legal currency, the Chinese government established a loan of 10 million pounds with four banks, including HSBC, Mercantile, China, and Communications. It was decided to establish an Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, whose members are Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin, general manager of the Bank of Communications, Hao Shumin, manager of the Shanghai branch of HSBC, Thomas, former manager of the Tianjin branch of Mercantile Bank, and Rogers, British financial advisor to China. It is reported that the committee will be established in Hong Kong soon. The use of the loan fund will be decided by the committee. After the establishment of the committee, China's legal currency reserves will be more substantial, people's confidence will be more solid, foreign exchange prices will be more stable, the statutory exchange rate will be maintained permanently, and the black market foreign exchange will gradually become stronger. Trade between countries and China will improve.</p>

<h3>Fu Cheng Linsheng Is Also Willing to Be a Puppet</h3>
<p>Going to Hankou to Serve as a Puppet "Mayor," Leaving Shanghai Quietly with Di Feiyuan</p>
<p>Modern News Agency reports that Cheng Linsheng, a real estate businessman in this city, was originally a well-known wealthy businessman with a large amount of accumulated assets. After the January 28th Incident, the real estate business in Shanghai failed, and Cheng fell sharply, getting worse and worse, and eventually sold his private residence on Maitehesi Road. His experience was quite tragic. For several years, he lived a difficult life and was no longer noticed by people. According to sources from relevant parties, Cheng, due to his desolate situation and boredom, disregarded his integrity and was willing to be a puppet. He had close contacts with the puppet organization, trying to take up a puppet position to make a fortune. Soon, he was attracted by Chen Fumu and met with the conspirator Doihara, who promised him the position of puppet "Mayor of Hankou." Cheng was flattered and left Shanghai quietly with Doihara and Chen Fumu a few days ago to engage in activities.</p>
<p>Japanese Long-Term Government Bonds</p>
<p>Astonishing Amount</p>
<p>More Than 16.9 Billion Yen</p>
<p>The mainland reported that the Japanese government's long-term government bonds had reached 16,914,719,000 yen at the end of last month, an increase of 29,344,000 yuan compared with January. In addition to these interest-bearing perpetual loans, the Tokyo government's short-term government bonds issued in the name of rice coupons reached 468,612,000 yuan, and those issued in the name of silk coupons reached 7,025,000 yuan. At the end of February, Japan's total domestic debt amounted to 15,635,004,000 yuan, an increase of 301,167,000 yuan compared with January. The total foreign debt was 1,279,715,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,733,000 yuan. The increase in domestic debt was mainly due to the issuance of the China Incident National Treasury Bonds and the 3.5% interest National Treasury Bonds to make up for the shortage of military expenses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Indulge Soldiers in Rape and Murder</h3>
<p>If Not, They Cannot Fight, Chinese Women Suffer Trampling</p>
<p>Mainland News Agency reports that Agnes Smedley, a well-known writer who is currently with the New Fourth Route Army, wrote an article in this week's Millard's Review of the Far East explaining that the massacres, rapes, and looting committed by Japanese soldiers in China were caused by the brutal treatment of these people by their officers. According to Ms. Smedley's article, it is now fully proven that senior Japanese commanders deliberately savage their soldiers, and if not, the war cannot continue, because the general</p>
<p>Most Miss</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers are concerned about the poverty of their families at home. Many Japanese officers lead and command their troops to burn, loot, rape and kill. If you read the captured Japanese letters and diaries, you can see that the Japanese army is now gradually becoming savage in their diaries. The only thing that Japanese soldiers do in the entire Nanjing and Zhenjiang area where I am now is either kill people or</p>
<p>Chase Women</p>
<p>It is not true to say that the Japanese army only uses Chinese prostitutes to vent their desires, because the prostitutes in the whole of China are not enough to fill the Japanese brothels in Hongkou, Shanghai. Most of the women in the "Imperial Army Comfort Station" are captured women. Civilized people cannot turn a blind eye to this today and say that the women raped by the Japanese army are prostitutes. This statement is not true. If the Japanese army wins this war, then what Chinese women</p>
<p>Are Suffering</p>
<p>Women in other countries will also suffer. The intellectual and spiritual development of the Japanese army is almost the same as that of Genghis Khan's troops hundreds of years ago. The only difference is the mere appearance. In fact, the Japanese army is fighting in China today, which is quite like the barbaric Mongolian army at that time.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships in Sanmen Bay Are</p>
<p>Repelled by Garrison</p>
<p>East Zhejiang Coast Is Peaceful, Population Is Being Evacuated. Three Japanese warships were discovered on the sea off Jiantiao, Sanmen Bay on the 15th. They first strafed the shore with machine guns, and then released a small boat carrying more than ten Japanese soldiers, who drove to Maotou Mountain in Ninghai County, attempting to</p>
<p>Forcibly Land</p>
<p>To search for food, chickens, pigs, sheep, etc. from the people. Later, the garrison and self-defense forces in the area worked together to resist, and the landing Japanese soldiers fled back to the ship in their original boat. The three ships have already sailed away. Sanmen Bay is one of the important ports in eastern Zhejiang. After the war, all ships were prohibited from entering, and the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters sent</p>
<p>Heavy Troops Stationed</p>
<p>The coastal ports have been fortified by the Ningbo and Taizhou Garrison Commanders, and heavy troops have also been stationed there, with strict precautions. The Yong River, Jiao River, Ou River, Ao River, etc. have all been blocked, but the Yong River and Ou River are</p>
<p>To Maintain Navigation</p>
<p>Ships are still allowed to enter the blockade line. The coastal bandits have been gradually wiped out after being rounded up. However, Japanese planes are often discovered in various parts of eastern Zhejiang, and Japanese warships patrol the sea from time to time. Because of the strict precautions taken by the garrison, the Japanese side's attempts to land will definitely be difficult to achieve. All places are still as peaceful as usual. The population of Haimen and other places has been evacuated.</p>
<h3>Japan's Destruction of North China's Finances: A Direct Retaliation is Warranted</h3>
<p>Legal Tender is also Considered Foreign Property; Destroying the Puppet Currency is Not Difficult</p>
<p>Japan Disregards the Repercussions of Anglo-American Protests</p>
<p>Continental Press reports that the nominal abolition of Chinese legal tender and the partial control of export foreign exchange have been in effect in North China for a week. According to all news coming from North China, these measures have met with the same results as developments of a similar nature in the past. Regarding currency, the prohibition of legal tender has</p>
<p>Clearly Failed</p>
<p>Because not only has the legal tender not depreciated or disappeared from the market, but the premium for exchanging it for the puppet currency of Peiping continued to increase this week. In other respects, this new method of attacking Western commerce in North China has been temporarily successful. European and American export trade in the ports of the Bohai Sea and Qingdao has temporarily come to a standstill. The Japanese and puppet authorities even forbid Western commercial firms from fulfilling previously agreed upon commercial agreements in violation of the new control system. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tianjin, it is clear that this new economic measure in North China is backed by the Japanese army. Japanese soldiers search Chinese and foreigners at the entrance of the former German concession for anyone carrying legal tender. This act is a barbaric military</p>
<p>Rude Action</p>
<p>And completely violates the treaty rights enjoyed by Westerners. Consular jurisdiction should protect foreign property not only legally but also in fact, regardless of Japan's wishes. Chinese legal tender is also considered foreign property. Many Western merchants in China deeply regret that their national authorities have not confronted the Japanese army in North China. Most of them want to know what would happen if Western troops protected the loading of export goods on foreign ships outside of Dagu, and foreign gunboats escorted them, disregarding the orders of the Peiping puppet government. Of course, the whole matter is not yet over. The British House of Commons has issued sharp words on the matter, and, together with the United States, has lodged a</p>
<p>Formal Protest</p>
<p>With the Tokyo government. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese side will not pay attention to these protests. However, Western civilized nations will not remain silent when they see their protests rejected, and they will likely take some kind of retaliation. However, it is generally hoped that retaliation will not be directed at North China itself, because this would harm the foreign interests in the area and might be indirectly manipulated by the Japanese side. Therefore, retaliation must be directed directly at Japan. The new measures in North China are being implemented by the Japanese side, and Western countries must make the Japanese feel that these measures are</p>
<p>Rash and Reckless</p>
<p>Only then will it stop. Whether the Japanese-puppet economic and monetary legislation in North China will succeed or not depends not only on the attitude of Western countries, but mostly on the Chinese people. The Chinese people in the cities of North China controlled by the Japanese army do not use direct methods of force, but continue to resist passively through non-cooperation, gradually rendering the Japanese efforts ineffective. If the Chinese people cooperate, then the exchange of legal tender for puppet currency today will not succeed. If the Chinese people continue to be united and resolute, then the special institutions of the Chinese banking industry and its numerous exchange shops can be used to</p>
<p>Continue to Destroy</p>
<p>The puppet currency of Peiping. A friend who has just returned to Shanghai from North China repeatedly urged reporters to pay attention to the price issue. He solemnly stated that the Japanese side has obviously ignored the seriousness of the price equalization issue in promoting the implementation of the new currency measures. It must be known that the price of one shilling and two pence for one yuan of puppet currency must be greatly reduced before it is feasible. In other words, the exchange rate for foreign currency quoted by the Peiping puppet bank is currently about 60% higher than it should be. The Japanese hope to be able to reduce the price equalization, but there is no sign of price reduction, and it is continuing to rise. Even in Peiping itself, the puppet authorities have established numerous regulations on official prices, but</p>
<p>Unable to Stop</p>
<p>The continued rise in prices. Earlier this week, the price of Saigon rice in Peiping jumped to an average of 25.5 yuan per bag. The price of North China's export products has also increased in proportion to the increase in the amount of puppet currency in circulation. The price of various imported goods has also increased, because the new currency measures have created new obstacles to imports and made the shortage of imported goods even worse. The Peiping puppet bank announced that it would sell foreign exchange to pay for imported goods, but no foreign merchant has purchased foreign exchange from it for private transactions. The puppet bank also established a so-called list of imported goods with priority rights, first supplying foreign exchange for the goods on the list, and then handling foreign exchange for other goods. The list includes Japanese military supplies</p>
<p>Accounted for the Majority</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the first week after the implementation of the new measures in North China was not encouraging. This move failed to solve the major economic and financial problems, but instead made these problems more unstable than before.</p>
<p>Bountiful Bamboo Shoot Supply in the Market</p>
<p>This year, the bamboo shoot market in this city has been quite expensive due to the scarcity of supply. In the past ten days, the weather has turned warmer, and the goods have been crowded, and the market has seen a price drop. Currently, the selling price of bamboo shoots is ten to eleven yuan per hundred market catties, and mao bamboo shoots are seven yuan. In the future, the market will change with the changes in the weather.</p>
<h3>Joint Performance by Changzhou and Wuxi Opera Troupes for Fundraising</h3>
<p>Broadcasting to Raise Funds for Education and Upbringing; Youth Association Holds Children's Competition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group is sparing no effort in its work to relieve refugees. The Changzhou and Wuxi Hometown Associations of this group, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai and the vast amount of supplies needed, have specially organized a joint performance of seven Changzhou and Wuxi opera troupes. After repeated efforts, they have invited famous actors from various troupes to rehearse and perform improved, wonderful, and high-minded famous plays. The actors have enthusiastically participated, using entertainment for charitable purposes and art performances to relieve refugees. It is scheduled to be performed at the Hushe Theater for three days from April 7th to 9th. Tickets are priced at one yuan and one yuan each. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will participate in this good cause. Ticket sales for the Changzhou and Wuxi Opera Troupes Joint Performance Art Show are located at No. 6, Lane 102, Middle Section of Tongfu Road, Changzhou Hometown Association, telephone number 34128.</p>
<p>Broadcasting to Raise Funds Declares Opening</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special Municipal Joint Association's Refugee Relief Committee held a broadcasting ceremony to raise funds for the Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute yesterday at noon. Zhou Bangjun and Tao Leqin delivered opening speeches. Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, Song Shixiang, and others reported on the significance of educating and raising women and children. All sectors of society cared for the distressed women and children and donated money for their adoption, which was quite enthusiastic. The association's broadcasting dates are until the 21st, for a total of four days. During the broadcasting period, in addition to the unanimous mobilization of all members of the Art Performance Broadcasting Committee, the committee's director Zhang Ye'er and others will be responsible for reporting. Zhou Bangjun's opening speech briefly stated that the association is holding a fundraising event for the Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute at the Washington Radio Station today. He would like to first talk about the purpose of the Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute. Relief work in Shanghai has been carried out for nearly 20 months, but it still focuses on the passive aspects, which is unavoidable because there are too many refugees, and it is already very difficult to raise supplies. It is difficult to fully organize the active work of educating and raising refugees for production. Recently, the Refugee Association has been stepping up planning for the resettlement of refugees, striving to make young and strong people engage in production and support themselves, and the elderly, weak, women, and children will also be educated. The association's Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute will pay special attention to education and vocational training, so that refugees can avoid laziness and prepare themselves for independence in the future. It is hoped that all sectors of society will support it and jointly promote its success.</p>
<p>Efforts to Promote Piggy Bank Movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Township Organization Solicitation Committee, in order to launch a piggy bank relief movement, resolved to organize a Piggy Bank Promotion Movement Committee, and appointed Chen Jicheng and fifteen others as committee members. The first resolution meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon (19th) to discuss the implementation methods.</p>
<p>Youth Association Holds Children's Competition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association has always been dedicated to serving the society, and has made many contributions. In the past year, it has been particularly effective in relieving refugees. Recently, the association has considered the education of children in shelters, in order to develop their talents, and promote the four educations of morality, intelligence, physique, and community for children. In order to arouse the attention of people in the society, it plans to hold a four-education competition for children. Detailed methods are being planned and will be held in the association's building early next month.</p>
<h3>This Year's Tea Loan: 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Provinces Establish Tea Management Offices; New Tea Picking Begins During Qingming Festival</p>
<p>Tea is a unique product of China. After the government encouraged production and the Trade Commission implemented controls, exports after the war have increased. This year's new tea picking will begin during the Qingming Festival. The commission will work with various provinces to handle this year's loan of 20 million yuan, and will establish management offices in the tea-producing provinces. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Encouraging Production and Compiling Exports</p>
<p>Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces are the largest tea-producing areas in China. The production is mainly exported to Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. After the war, the Trade Commission implemented controls, concentrating exports through Hong Kong. Last year's production did not decrease due to the war. On the contrary, due to government encouragement and assistance, and the enthusiastic lending of the silver and money industries, tea production increased. All of them were purchased by the China Tea Industry Company and the Fuhua Company and various foreign tea houses. The Trade Commission assessed the prices and implemented them, which was quite effective. Last year's exports totaled 416,246 quintals, worth 33,054,085 yuan in national currency, an increase of 3 million yuan compared to the 25th and 26th years.</p>
<p>This Upper Year Loan of 20 Million</p>
<p>In order to increase production, the Trade Commission has promoted tea planting in various border provinces, and has worked with the governments of Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan provinces to handle joint venture loans. The total amount is determined to be 20 million yuan in national currency. The Trade Commission assumes 80%, and the rest is assumed by the provincial governments. It is designated as a loan for the 28th year, and tea management offices are established in the tea-producing provinces, responsible for registering tea shops and tea factories, guiding tea farmers, improving quality, and increasing production. As for this year's new tea, which will begin to be picked around the Qingming Festival, it will all be purchased by the government, concentrated in Hong Kong, and then shipped out. Various foreign tea houses in Shanghai have established offices in the production areas to prepare for purchase.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Refugee Relief Association (Continued) (Yesterday) Management Policy of Shelters</h3>
<p>All of us who have come to participate in the relief work of the association should take the relief of refugees and service to the society as our purpose. As long as it is beneficial to the refugees and the society, we will not hesitate to sacrifice personal happiness. As far as I know, many of you present have done great things, but recently I have found that a few colleagues feel the bitterness of life because the association was just founded, and all the organizations and equipment have not been fully realized, and even their work is not as hard as when they first came. Since Ren Bao took over as the head of the shelter, he has insisted on using talent as the most important thing for the staff, and never uses private individuals, so most of the staff have been recruited. Before being assigned to a position, everyone has an individual talk, the most important of which is to tell them that the service of the association must be able to endure hardship and work hard, and everyone has expressed that they will serve the refugees as their purpose, and are willing to endure hardship and work hard. I also told them that the association's treatment is meager, and everyone's answer is that they will serve the public and will never care about the amount of salary. Even if someone is introduced to the association and submitted to me by the secretariat for screening, they will never be hired casually because of the relationship of the introduction, and they must also pass a considerable assessment and hire them according to their talents. There is no omission in the above talks, and everyone must find a guarantor and fill in a guarantee form. The guarantee form also clearly states that "if there is any misconduct, embezzlement of public funds, borrowing money in the name of..., bribery, or private acquisition of public property, manipulation of the hands, deduction of relief grain, injury to refugees, violation of office rules, and all kinds of illegal acts, etc.," the guarantor must be fully responsible. The guarantor is so heavily responsible, how can the colleagues not be vigilant at all times? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Adulterer and Adulteress Murder the Husband</h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Husband's Sleep, They Chopped Him to Death with an Ax and Moved the Body, Which Disappeared Without a Trace. The Case Was Only Solved a Few Days Ago. The Adulterer Was Arrested and Awaiting Capture, and the Adulteress Was Under Investigation.</p>
<p>Dou Youqing (24 years old, road worker), a native of Funing living in a bungalow on Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu, recently married a fellow villager named Zhang Er Guniang as his wife. The couple's relationship was not harmonious, and they often quarreled. At about 1:00 AM on the 21st of last month (that is, the Lunar New Year's Day), he was chopped to death with an ax and the body was moved, disappearing without a trace. His wife, Zhang Er Guniang, falsely claimed to her neighbors and her own biological mother, Zhang Zhou Shi, that her husband, Dou Youqing, was sipping tea at a nearby tea house and was taken away by someone to work.</p>
<p>He Never Returned Home. The neighbors believed it to be true and did not ask. She then took the opportunity to move her family to Yaoshui Lane, Roberts Road. The case was only solved by Yangshupu Police Station Chinese Detectives Zhang Guanying, Jin Wanrong, Ji Xiucheng, and others at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, they were passing by the intersection of Hangzhou Road and Lan Road and saw a group of children surrounding a pond. The detectives went forward to investigate and saw a rotten male corpse</p>
<p>Floating on the Water. A rope was tied around his waist. The police immediately tried to pull the corpse up, and at the end of the rope was a lead bucket filled with pebbles. The face of the corpse, with an ax mark, was very deep on the left cheek. The corpse was sent to the police hospital, where a doctor examined it and found that the injuries to the neck and left cheek of the corpse were quite severe. They were transferred to the Jiaozhou Road corpse examination center, waiting for the court to send officials to examine the corpse. At that time, a passerby, Xu Faxi, and a woman, Li Jiang Shi, recognized the corpse as their former neighbor, Dou Youqing, and went to report to his mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou Shi, at No. 8, Taishun Lane, Pingliang Road. She was unaware of</p>
<p>The Inside Story, her son-in-law was actually killed by her daughter, Zhang Er Guniang, and her lover, a fellow villager, Pang Kaibao (22 years old), together with an ax. Therefore, after learning about it, she rushed to Roberts Road to find her daughter, but had already fled after hearing the news. Afterwards, Chinese detectives arrested the murderer Pang Kaibao, took him into the police station for detention, and yesterday sent him to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and said that the investigation in this case revealed that</p>
<p>The Deceased's Wife, Zhang Er Guniang, had been in a relationship with the defendant for some time. The first time she wanted to kill her with an ax was on New Year's Eve of the Lunar New Year last year. Because Dou was sleeping peacefully in bed at the time, he suddenly woke up and failed to start. The second time was late this night, when Zhang Er Guniang stole a firewood ax from her neighbor, Li Jiang Shi, and handed it to the defendant. He chopped her husband to death with an ax while he was asleep, and then moved the body and threw it into Hangzhou Road (a pond dug by someone to build a house and filled with water to this day). In this case,</p>
<p>Zhang Er Guniang is at large, please postpone it, etc. Then the Chinese and Western detectives stated the process of solving the case, and presented the rope and the lead bucket for inspection. According to the deceased's mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou Shi, her daughter and the defendant conspired to kill her son-in-law, Dou Youqing, and she did not know, please appreciate. According to Li Jiang Shi's proof, the ax presented in the case was indeed stolen from her home, etc. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendant and ordered him to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Passengers Drown at Sea on the Tangsai Ship Bound for Ningbo; Two Suicide Notes Have Been Sent to Family Members</h3>
<p>The Tangsai ship left Shanghai for Ningbo on the 14th. In the middle of the journey, a passenger jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The ship has now returned to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Drowning at Sea in the Deep Night. The Tangsai ship departed from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 14th for Ningbo. In the third-class cabin of the ship, a middle-aged passenger suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide when the ship arrived in the waters of Daji Mountain.

<h3>Young Woman Forced into Prostitution Sues to Escape the Fire Pit</h3>
<p>For the sake of future happiness, she is determined to extricate herself and accuses Hua Linmei of obscenity.</p>
<p>Wang Lili, a woman from Xiangshan, Zhejiang, is now 21 years old. Recently, she hired lawyer Yin Tinghua to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Hua Linmei, who lives at No. 2, Yuancheng Lane, Pingjili Road, Lafayette Road, of obscenity and other crimes. Her lawsuit briefly stated that since the plaintiff's parents died early, she was taken to Shanghai by someone in the 25th year of the Republic of China to live with the defendant. Who knew that the defendant would force the plaintiff to work as a prostitute, ordering an old woman to lead her to various hotels such as China, Dadong, Yipinxin, and Dongya, and various amusement parks such as Wing On, to be ravaged by men. Since October of last year, she was forced to enter the Qingyi Guidance Agency. For several years, the income from her nightly fees and guidance fees has been received by the defendant, amounting to a considerable amount. Usually, if she is slightly displeased, she will be privately imprisoned, which is very painful. Recently, she asked the defendant to restore her freedom, and was illegally detained in the attic, until recently, she was able to go out. The investigation shows that the plaintiff has reached adulthood and has the capacity to act according to law. For the sake of future happiness, she is determined to extricate herself, escape the fire pit, and restore all the freedom granted by law. However, the plaintiff has suffered this pain, and her life's happiness has been buried, and the harm is real. The defendant uses the detention of women to engage in adultery with others for profit as a regular business, and obviously commits the crimes of Article 231, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and should be summoned and tried according to law, etc. This morning, Judge Xiao took the seat in the Second Criminal Court to summon the defendant, Hua Linmei, but she did not arrive. It was ordered to wait for the defendant to arrive and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>One Criminal Arrested; One Criminal at Large; Hearing Rescheduled After the Case is Clarified</p>
<p>Lu Yili, a 36-year-old from Changzhou and a runner for Huacheng Coal at No. 33, Sichuan Road, Public Concession, claimed to Wu Jitong, the manager of the shop, on the 4th of this month that the Dachunghua Overshoes Factory needed to purchase 200 tons of Hongji coal dust. Wu asked Lu which coal shop in Shanghai had this coal dust for sale, and asked Lu to find a way. Lu replied that Yuanxiang Coal at No. 10, Gansidong Road, French Concession, still had</p>
<p>Hongji Coal Dust</p>
<p>Stock in stock, which can be purchased to replenish, etc. Wu Jitong sent shop staff Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen, together with Lu Yili, to Yuanxiang Coal to purchase the goods the next day (5th) according to the market price. Weng brought 4,680 yuan in cash, and Lu brought 2,000 yuan in cash, totaling 6,680 yuan. Weng, Lu, and Zheng hired a Yunfei car to go to Yuanxiang Coal on Gansidong Road. After arriving at the destination, they contacted Chen Kangyuan (34-year-old Ningbo native), a runner for Yuanxiang Coal. Weng handed the 4,680 yuan in cash to Lu Yili, who went to</p>
<p>Yuanxiang Coal's</p>
<p>Upstairs to inspect and deliver, with Chen Kangyuan. Weng and Zheng waited downstairs. Later, Chen and Lu went downstairs and handed Weng Shaoyou a bill of lading for 200 tons of Hongji coal dust from the same industry's Tongchang Coal's Pudong Sanjing Coal Stack. On the 7th, Wu Jitong, the manager of Huacheng Coal, sent someone to Pudong Sanjing Coal Stack to pick up the goods but was unable to find them. He went to Lu Yili to negotiate. It was known that Lu had already fled with his wife on this day, and there was no place to find him. He then negotiated with Chen Kangyuan of Yuanxiang Coal. Chen</p>
<p>Flatly Denied</p>
<p>That there was such a transaction. At this point, Wu realized that he had been cheated, and Lu had no place to track down. He then entrusted lawyer Wang Henggu to report to the French Police Station, Chen Kangyuan defrauded him of his property, and requested that he be arrested and investigated. The police chief approved the word and sent detectives to arrest Chen Kangyuan and send him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanxun continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan of the French Concession Administrative Authority stated the case and filed a lawsuit according to law. The prosecutor Wu Jitong entrusted lawyer Wang to represent the collateral civil suit, seeking to recover</p>

<p>6,680 yuan. The defendant Chen Kangyuan still firmly denied that there was such a transaction, and the witnesses Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen testified in court that Lu Yili contacted the defendant to purchase the goods and handed the money to Lu Yili, who went upstairs with the defendant to inspect and deliver, and handed it downstairs, and the defendant handed over the bill of lading of Tongchang.

<h3>Lawyers Association News</h3>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association had a total of 1,300 members before the outbreak of the August 13th Incident two years ago. During the tense period of the Shanghai war, most lawyers left Shanghai to work in the rear, and there were not a few of them. With the westward movement of the National Army and the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a small number also turned into upstarts in the puppet regime. Therefore, at the end of that year, less than half of the lawyers remained in Shanghai. Later, due to the expansion of the war zone, lawyers from various places gathered in Shanghai and successively applied to join the association as members to practice law in Shanghai. By the end of last year, the number had recovered to 1,300. Recently, the association, upon the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, has reported the expulsion of lawyers who have been clearly confirmed to have participated in important positions in the puppet organization, and their lawyer qualifications have been revoked. The association is now reprinting the membership directory and has included more than twenty new members who joined this year, such as Huang Zhenqing, Yu Zhewen, Chen Rongfa, Shan Zonglu, Ying Shulin, Chen Xintian, etc., in the new membership directory.</p>

<h3>Yu Zhendong's Residence and City Properties to be Sold at Auction by the Court for Over One Million</h3>
<p>No Bids Received; Litigation Arises Over Movable Property</p>
<p>The Western-style house at 43 Gu Bai Road in the French Concession is the residence of Yu Zhendong from Haimen. The city properties and residences nearby are also owned by Yu. Previously, they were mortgaged to the British firm Taylor &amp;amp; Little for one million National currency. Later, they were mortgaged to the Japanese firm Yatani &amp;amp; Co. for 100,000 yuan. Upon maturity without redemption, the Special Second Court ruled that Taylor &amp;amp; Little were the preferred creditor. The execution court auctioned the properties according to law, with a minimum price of 1.47 million yuan, but no one bid. Regarding all the movable property in the house, Shimada Mannosuke, a Japanese merchant, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court, suing Taylor &amp;amp; Little and Yu Zhendong, requesting confirmation of the mortgage right and opposing Taylor &amp;amp; Little's disposal of the movable property. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wu Xiaoke in the Seventh Civil Court. Both parties were represented by lawyers who appeared in court. The court noted that both parties intended to reconcile, so after a brief hearing, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to March 29th.</p>

<p>Qu Xin, a 38-year-old Cantonese man from Baitucun, Zhaoqing, Guangdong Province, worked as a fireman on a British Blue Funnel Line steamboat. The vessel had recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and was berthed at the Blue Funnel Line wharf in Pudong, opposite Yangshupu. It is said that, for some unknown reason, Qu suddenly had a moment of madness and committed suicide in his fireman's cabin on the night of the 17th by cutting his throat with a bayonet, leaving a hole in his throat. He died instantly. His body was discovered at 4:30 a.m. yesterday by another fireman, Li De (44-year-old Cantonese), and a coolie, Gao Xuezi (54-year-old Shanghainese).

The ship's authorities reported the incident to the Maritime Police Station, who dispatched Western Detective Arloff (transliteration) to investigate the cabin. The body was then transported by small boat to the Yuxing Wharf on the 16th Pier.

<h3>Public Works Bureau Rushing to Build Shanhai Pass Road</h3>
<p>Xinzha Road to be Repaired</p>
<p>The section of Xinzha Road in the Public Concession from North Chengdu Road westward to McTaggart Road has been damaged, and there are many vehicles, which often causes danger. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau ordered the Xinzha Police Station in charge to prohibit rickshaws from traveling on it. Construction has been underway for more than half a year. Now, except for a small part of the road from Datong Road eastward to Chengdu Road, which is still under construction, the rest has been repaired. Currently, rickshaws, handcarts, and bicycles are allowed to travel eastward from McTaggart Road, but are still not allowed to travel westward from Chengdu Road. Because since rickshaws were banned from Xinzha Road last year, a group of heavy-loaded flatbed carts, "tiger" carts, handcarts, rickshaws, and bicycles, whether from west to east or from east to west, had to detour via Shanhai Pass Road to the south of McTaggart Road and Chengdu Road, and via West Suzhou Road along the river to the north. Therefore, these two roads suddenly became lively. However, heavy-loaded vehicles found West Suzhou Road inconvenient to travel on and had to travel via Shanhai Pass Road. As a result, the road surface there was severely damaged. Although it was repaired from time to time, it was repaired and destroyed immediately due to the large number of vehicles, which was of no help. Recently, the Public Works Bureau specially dispatched a large number of coolies to remove the damaged road surface and carry out major repairs. Moreover, there is a small vegetable market there, and pedestrians are very busy, so construction is being rushed.</p>

<h3>Finance  European Situation Tense  Gold Price Plunge Spreads</h3>
<p>Closed at 2066 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market situation was dim and lifeless, its momentum also weak and sluggish, thus the downward trend gradually expanded. This was mainly because China, benefiting from British aid, established the Exchange Equalization Fund. Consequently, the legal tender base became increasingly solid. Moreover, it was reported that the British Parliament was expected to pass the stabilization of the Chinese legal tender plan within the next week. In addition, the European situation became increasingly tense as German forces encountered resistance from a small number of Czech troops. Therefore, operators generally believed that foreign exchange had the potential for long-term appreciation, leading to extreme anxiety. Jewelry shops sold off in droves, and money changers fiercely competed to unload on behalf of local clients. As a result, the price plummeted, reaching the day's low of 2,066 yuan. However, the price briefly rose mid-day due to purchases by gold firms, but ultimately, demand could not keep up with supply, and it was difficult to sustain the increase. Consequently, the price plunged 18 yuan. Trading volume was thin as Tianjin and Hong Kong traders remained on the sidelines, totaling only 700 taels. Silver jewelry also continued to fall by one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Plummeted 18 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, sellers initially quoted 2,085-86 yuan per bar (ten taels), while buyers bid 80 yuan, leading to a stalemate until 9:45 am. Trading finally commenced with a cash dealer buying 50 taels from a money changer at 2,082 yuan, 2 yuan lower than the previous day's close. Subsequently, a broker bought another 50 taels at 81 yuan. Although jewelry shops and some money changers tended to sell, the situation remained relatively stable due to strong absorption by gold firms, hovering around 80 yuan. A gold firm bought 100 taels from jewelry shops at 80 and 81 yuan. A broker then bought 50 taels from a money changer at 80 yuan. Jewelry shops traded 50 taels among themselves at 81 yuan. A gold firm bought 50 taels from jewelry shops at 80 yuan. Then, a gold firm bought 50 taels from a money changer, also at 80 yuan. Later, the gold firm bought another 50 taels from a money changer at 78 yuan. After this, the gold firms ceased buying and stepped aside, while sellers became more eager, leading to a sudden weakening and the price breaking through the 70 yuan barrier. Money changers traded 50 taels among themselves at 69 yuan, and soon after, another 50 taels at 67 yuan. Then, a gold firm resumed buying, triggering a rebound. The gold firm bought 50 taels from a money changer at 69 yuan, and later another 50 taels at 75 yuan, which was the noon close price. In the afternoon, demand further weakened, causing the price to fall back into the 70 yuan range. Trading was limited to money changers trading 50 taels among themselves at 2,066 yuan, which was the evening close price. Consequently, the price plunged 18 yuan compared to the previous day (having fallen for two consecutive days, totaling 30 yuan), with a daily range of 16 yuan. The cash firm's selling price for its own brand gold was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,060 yuan. The current gold spot price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Reduced by One Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. However, around 11:07 am, due to the weakening trend of cash gold, it was also reduced by one yuan. Da Tong Heng lowered its price to 210 yuan, while Xin Tong Heng lowered it to 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Remained Unchanged Yesterday</p>
<p>London, 17th. British pure gold remained unchanged, staying at £7 8s 6d per ounce. Consequently, the Central Bank of China's cash buying price also remained at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price also remained unchanged, at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold spot price also remained at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Most Foreign Currencies Fell</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged, and British-American exchange rates continued to decline by 0.25. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms continued to actively settle accounts, and banks provided ample supply, stabilizing market prices. Cash gold opened weak, with frequent selling of long positions. Jewelry shops also supplied from time to time. Gold firms and money changers did not absorb the supply smoothly, leading to a sharp plunge at one point. Later, gold firms and money changers took advantage of the low prices to absorb the supply, gradually stabilizing the market. Afternoon trading was sluggish, with long positions continuing to be unloaded and few buyers. Market prices continued to weaken. Tianjin and Hong Kong traders purchased very little this week due to high remittance rates in Tianjin and falling gold prices in Hong Kong, making it difficult to profit. The demand for British and American gold pounds had decreased. However, wealthy individuals purchased a significant amount of British gold notes. Foreign banks also sold American gold notes. Due to the weakness of cash gold, most market prices declined. Canadian dollars rose due to the trend of equalization between the Canadian and American exchange rates. Public Association transactions were rare. Cheng Tai sold 300 yuan of American gold notes to Chang Tai, and Yong Tai sold 200 yuan of American gold notes to Chang Tai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 0.35 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.05 yuan, American gold pounds peaked at 0.20 yuan, American gold notes fell by 0.02 yuan, French franc notes rose by 0.0075 yuan, Annamite piastres fell by 0.01 yuan, Canadian dollars rose by 0.09 yuan, Italian lira rose by 0.005 yuan, German gold notes fell by 0.01 yuan, Australian gold notes fell by 0.10 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts returned to normal, remaining at about 50 yuan per thousand yuan, ending at 50 yuan, unchanged from the previous day.</p>
<p>Reserve Fund</p>
<p>Separate Funds</p>
<p>The Sino-British Exchange Reserve Fund, with contributions of £3 million each from HSBC and the Bank of China, and £2 million each from Mercantile Bank and Chartered Bank, will implement exchange rate adjustments. Personnel will be selected from each of these banks. It is said that the funds of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications come from overseas gold deposits.</p>

<h3>Tianjin and Hong Kong Bought, but Banks Sold  Foreign Exchange Remained Unchanged</h3>
<p>British-American Exchange Rates Fell Again Yesterday  Balance Tax Plunged 0.0225</p>
<p>Exchange Market: Yesterday, although Hong Kong and Tianjin traders, as well as foreign firms, successively engaged in settlements, the potential trend was very balanced because banks were willing to sell. As a result, neither side gained an advantage. The British-American exchange rate fell for four consecutive days without any impact. Transactions were also very few. The Hong Kong exchange rate was relatively stable due to equal supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large bar silver fell by 0.375 for the near term and 0.125 for the distant term. New York silver prices remained stagnant. London raw gold also did not rise or fall. The exchange rate of British currency against American currency fell by 0.019, against French currency rose by 0.06 centimes, and against Shanghai currency fell by 0.00125. The exchange rate of American currency against British currency fell by 0.0025, against French currency fell by 0.1875, and against Shanghai currency fell by 0.05. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks' opening selling prices in the morning were 8.025 pence for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency, the same as the previous close for both British and American currencies. After opening, although Hong Kong traders, Tianjin traders, and foreign firms mutually engaged in settlements, the situation remained largely unchanged because banks were still providing ample supply. Hong Kong traders, Tianjin traders, and foreign firms settled accounts at HSBC, Hua Bi, and other banks at 8.025 pence for British currency and 16.0625 yuan for American currency. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax plunged by 0.0225, accounting for 6.25%. Afterwards, supply and demand became scarce, with only some banks engaging in futures trading. Thus, the situation became increasingly stable. A foreign bank purchased (April) American currency at 16 yuan from a certain bank. Near noon, a foreign firm absorbed 55.375 yuan of Hong Kong currency from a foreign bank in Andar, and the situation also remained largely unchanged.

<p>North-South Loan</p>
<p>Qingdao Fresh Fruit</p>
<p>Also Subject to "Control"</p>
<p>Qingdao correspondent: The local raw peanuts and fresh fruit are again subject to control by a certain party. If they are transported to Central China or South China, it is necessary to first obtain a certificate of exchange sale from the "Foreign Exchange Management Office" established by the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank," otherwise the customs will not release the goods. Therefore, production prices have risen. Raw peanuts have risen by 1.89 yuan compared to the beginning of this month. The Zhongzhuang grade is priced at 12.80 yuan, and 1,600 packages were handled by foreign firms. Large-grain peanuts are priced at 13.80 yuan, with 3,100 packages traded.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton  Actual Demand Slightly Moving  Yarn Prices Rise by More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>20-Count Yarn Alone Without Honor</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with a slightly tightening trend. The South China, Hong Kong, and Shantou traders have slightly increased their demand, resulting in a solid bullish sentiment. As for the eastern Zhejiang region and the Hunan-Jiangxi areas, they are procuring fine yarn and thread for summer use. Therefore, a certain firm in the industry is actively absorbing supply in the market, closing off sales. The market situation is tighter, with even more artificial maneuvering. As a result, the upward trend is unstoppable. However, upon examining actual transactions, they are indeed slightly weak, but trading among peers exceeds customer sales by several times. The inventory of this commodity is quite low, making it easy to stir up waves. Therefore, the 20-count yarn supply is relatively abundant, and the momentum is moderate. The 20-count yarn market was flat in the afternoon, but thread prices continued to rise sharply, with 32-count yarn soaring by more than ten yuan.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Situation: The market opened relatively peaceful in the early morning, but thread prices were more active due to increased inquiries from Zhejiang traders, leading to bullish sentiment. Everyone was holding tight and unwilling to sell, making the market even more bullish. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn remained at 394.5 yuan. However, the price of 32-count thread jumped by ten yuan. The price of fine yarn and thread then rose sharply, pulling up yarn prices. The market remained flat until the close. The yarn market remained plain and unremarkable when it opened in the afternoon, but 32-count thread prices were mutually bid up, due to some procurement from Wenzhou and Hunan. However, factories released several hundred packages of thread during the price surge, resulting in a total transaction volume of 1,289 packages. Prices for 32-count and 42-count yarn soared by 5 to 15 yuan. There was not much change in 20-count yarn. Zhenhua Factory released 50 packages of 16-count Double Dragon yarn at a price of 325 yuan. Shenxin No. 9 Factory released 250 packages of 32-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 550 yuan. Xinyu Factory released 150 packages of 32-count Earth yarn at a price of 540 yuan, all for April delivery. Today, 45 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin and 400 pieces were shipped to Quanzhou. The amounts purchased by each trader are listed on the left: Shantou 310, Hong Kong 130, Inland 45, Ningbo 79, Hunan 55, Yunnan 120, Wenzhou 150, Xiamen 30, Peers 730, Total 1289. The yarn market remains firm because the northern Tianjin region has reported strong demand for textiles recently, boosting the yarn market. The current spot price for 20-count Water Moon yarn is 339 yuan, and it has reached 40 yuan. The current spot price for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 329 yuan, and it has reached over 30 yuan. It is said that it was bought again at the close.</p>
<p>Application to Import 1,000 Bales of Indian Cotton</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market is exceptionally uncertain. It fell in the early morning due to a telegram from Liverpool. News from Washington indicated that a plan to encourage cotton export subsidies was in progress. It was reported that the Department of Agriculture had recommended that the government immediately release 1 million bales of loan cotton, but the details were difficult to ascertain. According to Congressman Smith, he will strongly oppose the Department of Agriculture's proposal. Yesterday, New York's near-term prices rose by 3 points, and distant-term prices fell by 2 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1 rupee, due to the instability of the European situation and the issue of the release of American loan cotton. There are concerns that Indian cotton may face slight setbacks. Egyptian cotton fell by 3 points. Yesterday's exchange rates did not fluctuate much. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices increased by 0.2 yuan per dan for American cotton and Brazilian cotton, increased by 0.3 yuan for Indian cotton, and remained unchanged for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Recently, there has been more trading of 10-count and 20-count yarn, so the cotton purchased by various factories is mostly for the raw materials for yarn spinning. Shenxin again imported 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, Bai Luo District yesterday, with the combined factory delivery price being 75.5 yuan. Japanese factories are refraining from placing orders due to the difficulty in securing Indian cotton, so Japanese factories have stopped ordering Indian cotton for many days. Public attention has shifted to American cotton. However, there may be inconveniences in purchasing American cotton if the American loan cotton is not released yet. Yesterday's cotton prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Tongzhou Cotton Rose to 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>The local cotton business is less active. Although the trading volume is small, there are many transactions. Chinese and Japanese factories did not handle a single package because the actual green prices are too high and are rising endlessly. In short, although the inventory in various production areas has not been exhausted, transportation is hindered, and the source is lacking, so market prices are advancing step by step. New high prices are emerging one after another. The current peak price for Tongzhou cotton has reached 80 yuan, up another yuan from the previous day. The price of Fire Machine Mustard cotton remains the same. Tongzhou cotton arriving from northern Jiangsu is only 268 bales. Today, 200 pieces of organic cotton were exported to Ningbo and 70 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 4,680 pieces of Yao cotton were imported from Ningbo. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<p>Tinplate</p>
<p>Selling Offers Increased Sharply</p>
<p>After Tianjin traders and a certain organization received a large quantity of tinplate, standards rose sharply. Although overseas firms have placed quite a few orders, the market has suddenly surged. For example, the price for No. 24 is fixed at £4 8s 6d per box, and the price for No. 26 is fixed at £3 10s per box (both German goods), both up 5 shillings compared to before. These are forward goods, which cannot supply the immediate needs of this port. Therefore, the market atmosphere is increasingly strong. The most recent selling offer for No. 24 is 145 yuan per box, up 5 yuan from before, and the price for No. 26 is 130 yuan per box, also up 4 yuan from before. Sales are very smooth to textile mills, toy factories, and customer traders in this area. It is said that more than a hundred boxes were sold in the past two days. Indian newspapers have also arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Imports and Exports</p>
<p>Tea and Tobacco Leaves Arrived in Shanghai in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Indian Newspapers Also in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday's imports included 120 pieces of tea leaves shipped from Ningbo, 40 pieces of tobacco leaves also from Ningbo, 1,100 tons of tobacco leaves shipped from New York, another 250 pieces from Wenzhou, 485 pieces of fresh eggs from Ningbo, 14,570 pieces of stationery paper from Wenzhou, another 5,800 pieces from Ningbo, and 369 pieces of Indian newspapers from New York.</p>
<p>Seafood</p>
<p>Arrowroot Flour Sells Well</p>
<p>Arrowroot flour inventory is thin, and local merchants' appetite for it is strong, so selling offers have become stronger. Currently, the market price for the Flying Unicorn brand is 16.5 yuan, the 3× brand is 16 yuan, and the Person and Gun brand is 18.4 yuan, with each brand up 0.3 to 0.4 yuan respectively.</p>

<h3>Securities  European Storms</h3>
<p>British Far East Stocks Declined Continuously  Domestic Debt Market Also Unsettled</p>
<p>Securities dark market: Yesterday's market situation continued to fluctuate and failed to calm down. Due to the brewing European storms, there was fear of an incident, and people were unsettled. Throughout the day, the most notable was the continuous buying by No. 4, whose background also belonged to large institutions. Tong Kang also continuously absorbed supply. No. 5 sold Class C and E shares and switched to Class A shares, obviously with other plans. On the selling side, there was much inconsistency. In the morning, Yong Kang, Tian Sheng, and Zhong Yi sold. In the afternoon, Le Mao, Yong Kang, and retail investors sold. Buyers also included sporadic numbers like No. 5, No. 42, and Mao Da. Therefore, the market price fluctuated due to the choices of various traders. The market initially weakened and then rose in the morning, ultimately declining again. The market initially fell and then recovered in the afternoon. The market price changed several times a day, demonstrating the anxiety of the people. Consequently, it continued to decline by a small amount of 0.57 yuan, with a chaotic trend that was difficult to grasp. The total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading included 50 shares of Chinese Electric Power Company, priced at 5.425 yuan. London British Far East companies' stocks had listed market prices on the 17th (Friday). Affected by the development of the European situation, they continued to decline. HSBC Bank's British registered shares continued to fall by £1, priced at £86. Hong Kong registered shares continued to fall by £2, priced at £84. Kaiping Coal Mine shares continued to fall by 3 pence, priced at 18 shillings. The Gulangyu Rubber Company shares continued to fall by 1 shilling and 3 pence, priced at 18 shillings and 9 pence. Only Mercantile Bank shares slightly recovered by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £8 17s 6d. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign currency bonds listed market prices on the 17th of this month (Friday): The Sino-French American 5% loan, with printed debt tickets, plummeted by £1.5, priced at £67.5. The Shanghai Railway loan, with printed debt tickets, rose by 0.5 pound, priced at £16.5. All other bonds remained unchanged. The supply and demand for physical goods in London was also sluggish.</p>
<p>Bitter Almonds</p>
<p>Tianjin Restricted Exports Local Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>The restriction on bitter almond exports from Tianjin came into effect on the 10th of this month. Therefore, goods shipped out before the 10th are still arriving, resulting in a soaring trend. The price for higher quality goods has been quoted at 70 yuan to 60 yuan. Yesterday, northern goods merchants arrived with more than 50 pieces of slightly inferior goods, but only 30 pieces were offered at 65 yuan, with the remaining merchants insisting on 70 yuan or more before making a further offer.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Soybean Trading Declined</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean sales market was particularly sluggish. Export traders were inactive, and only local merchants showed some interest. The total market trading volume included 20 packages of Pudong Du soybeans, priced at 10 yuan; 200 packages of Chongming sand soybeans, priced at 8.45 yuan; 160 packages of Dalian spot soybeans, priced at 8.43 yuan. Warehouses resold two cars for April delivery, priced at 8.36 yuan and 8.37 yuan. The market price, except for sand soybeans, which fell by 0.05 yuan, experienced slight declines of 0.01 or 0.02 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 1,340 packages of beans were shipped to Quanzhou.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<p>White Coal Quietly Declines</p>
<p>High-grade white coal fines have suddenly appeared abundant since the beginning of the year. Currently, another foreign vessel has arrived with 5,000 tons of large shipments of Hongji fines. As factories' demand gradually diminishes, it is difficult to see improvements in trading, resulting in a market situation that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. However, sales of No. 2 fines are still smooth, as coal ball factories are cheap and easy to sell. The high-resolution goods that were recently sold totaled over 600 tons. The quoted price for No. 1 fines is 28 yuan per ton, No. 2 fines are 22 yuan per ton, and Xin Hong fines are 21.5 yuan per ton. Warehouse delivery, with merchants adding extra.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Unraveling the Reason for the Continued Rise in Japanese Silk Prices</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of inflation, Shanghai silk prices have soared, turning it into a sales ground for Japanese silk, which has further led to a prolonged closure of the export silk market.</p>
<p>The Yokohama silk market experienced another surge in prices the day before yesterday. Spot prices opened at 1070 yen, up 35 yen, and forward prices at 1025 yen, up 40 yen, setting unprecedented records. During the first sharp rise in Yokohama silk prices, the Yokohama authorities suppressed speculation and ordered the suspension of auctions. Furthermore, it was rumored that East Market silk prices would be restricted to within 1000 yen by some regulations, which led to a decline in Japanese and American silk prices. However, since the 11th of this month, when Yokohama had fallen to 960 yen, the East Market silk prices have been rising for the past seven days, soaring by 110 yen, almost exceeding the 'regulation' by 200 yen, without any apparent intervention. Therefore, Shanghai silk market understands this price surge as follows: the initial restrictions on Japanese silk prices have been lifted, allowing prices to rise freely, which is attributed to the issue of Japanese currency value. The surge in hoarding and speculation is due to the recent announcement by the Japanese Finance Minister about the decision to implement inflation. This kind of price surge is more valuable within Japan, but in the global market, it still needs to go through exchange rate relations, which will reduce the impact of its sharp rise; this is the first point. Recently, although Yokohama silk prices have risen sharply, the increases in spot prices and near and far-term prices are very uneven, and it is also reported that spot prices are rising while forward prices are falling. This is probably due to the reason for covering shorts when silk prices fell the week before. In addition, New York's spot supply is scarce (silk inventory decreased by 10,000 bales at the end of February), making the need more urgent, and the arrival of raw silk shipments to the United States in March is delayed, creating a situation of scrambling for spot goods; this is the second point. Therefore, this surge can be inferred to be due to fewer supporters from consumers and more due to other special reasons, and there is no significant difference in the nature of this surge from the previous one.</p>
<p>The New York silk market also saw a strong price surge the day before yesterday, with near-term prices up 3.5 cents, far-term prices up 5 cents, spot Japanese silk up 7 cents, and Shanghai and Guangdong silk up 5 cents, still not exceeding the previous highest record (short by about 2 cents). Furthermore, due to the recent lengthening of exchange rates, the combined price of Shanghai silk in the American market is still at 1700 yuan, making it difficult for local port exports to approach.</p>
<p>In this surge of overseas silk prices, the local silk market clearly did not see the enthusiasm of the previous surge. People are hesitant, and there is still little buying or selling. The excessive surge in local silk prices in the previous period, followed by a sudden reversal, has not yet fully recovered from the negative impact. For example, silk factories using rayon instead of real silk has reached 60%, which is a very serious problem. It can be seen that the excessive increase in domestic silk prices (a surge that is divorced from actual sales) not only cut off the domestic sales outlet for raw silk but also objectively opened up a vast market for large quantities of Japanese rayon. This directly damages the foundation of the war of resistance and increases the capital of fascist aggression; this is the first point. Secondly, the prolonged closure of the export silk market has also led to sluggish silk sales and a loss of strong support for silk prices. This not only makes speculators reap the consequences but also leads the entire silk industry onto a path with many pitfalls. All of this is sufficient to confirm the conclusion in the previous article in this publication, "Why Have Silk Prices Surged Excessively Recently?" namely, "Those under the pressure of this surge are still our own people," which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>At this point, the author would like to raise this question again and sincerely ask the silk industry to learn from the lesson of this excessive rise in silk prices to avoid repeating the same mistakes. (Yang)</p>

<p>Ke Xian [a type of rice] Production Areas Send Telegrams Prohibiting Long-Distance Transport; Prices Jump Two or Three Jiao</p>
<p>Ke Xian rice has received telegrams from Nanjing and Wuhu, stating that exports are prohibited in those areas, and existing rice cannot be fully loaded. Therefore, the cargo owners are again holding out for higher prices and unwilling to sell cheaply. Prices immediately jumped two or three jiao. Wuhu Xian has risen to 13 yuan, and Nanjing High Xian has reached 13 yuan and 2 jiao, with middle and lower grades following suit.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Prices are High; People's Sentiment is Also Lifted by the Rise in Local Ke Xian Prices. Currently, Saigon No. 1 foreign rice has risen by one or two jiao, with 300 to 400 bags sold at prices ranging from 17 yuan and 2 jiao to 17 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, and 17 yuan and 1 jiao. The market price is rising, and rice merchants are again focusing on placing orders, but transportation is temporarily difficult. Even the report that Ningbo and Shaoxing have placed orders has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>The source of domestic rice has suddenly become scarce after a certain party in Changshu, Wuxi, and other places prohibited the issuance of transportation permits. Although there are 17th and 18th grade rice arriving at Hexia, only 1000 to 2000 bags are transported by train. Market sentiment has therefore recovered, with most hoarders buying in. The street also followed suit, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a tight market. As a result, the price of thick and thin粳 rice has risen by one or two jiao, and Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian have also risen by a jiao or so. Bian Yuan has not seen a change because the prices are already high.</p>
<p>Today, 8,500 bags of wheat flour were shipped to Tianjin, 200 bags to Ningbo, 4,400 bags to Fuzhou, and 12,400 bags to Quanzhou.</p>
<p>In addition, 250 bags of wheat were shipped to Ningbo, and 9,000 bags of wheat bran to Quanzhou.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes</p>
<p>Oil Market Turns Steady</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Pieces of Soybean Cake Shipped to Quanzhou</p>
<p>Yesterday, the oil cake market was peaceful because it was the weekend and there was not much change in the daily quoted prices. Yesterday, it was estimated that 10 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at 31 yuan original price. 100 barrels of Dalian current soybean oil were sold at 32 yuan and 5 fen, and 1 jiao and 5 fen; 50 barrels for delivery in 7 days at 31 yuan and 9 jiao; 100 barrels for delivery in the lower half of March at 31 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 jiao and a half; and 500 barrels for delivery in April at 31 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen to 31 yuan and 9 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Only 5,000 pieces of Dalian soybean cake for May delivery were offered at 3 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Today, 22,750 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Quanzhou, and 1,100 pieces were shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Spring and Summer Goods Sales Are Flourishing Daily</h3>
<p>White Shirting Flannel Inventory Sold Out; Dong Piece Fine Cloth Dyeing Sales are Strong</p>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Due to the short spring and early hot weather this year, the sales of spring and summer goods in this street and nearby areas have started exceptionally early. Therefore, the demand for spring and summer goods is widespread, and the supply is difficult to meet due to the limited bleaching and dyeing factories. Yesterday, the sales of Southwest Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong merchants gradually improved. In addition to buying bleached and printed goods, 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of raw grey autumn fragrance twill blue cloth were also added. Therefore, the selling price of grey cloth suddenly increased by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. The street is seeing flourishing sales of dark and light-colored cloths, and the price per piece has also increased by about 2 jiao. Although the factory prices of white fine twill coarse cloth are firm, the actual sales performance is mediocre and remains weak. Fine cloth is most popular from the Yongan Factory's Dapeng brand. It is very difficult to find spot goods. Fugui fine cloth has increased by more than 5 fen. Due to weak actual sales, the rebound in the products of various factories is weak. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of Fugui Ai Zi fine cloth and fine twill. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants purchased 120 to 130 packages of fine cloth and fine twill from various brands. Spring sales at the street's retail stores are very active. The current goods, such as foreign yarn poplin, bleached cloth, and light-colored cloth, are in high demand. Last year's inventory of white shirting flannel has been sold out. Very few factories produce it. The market price is increasing. Yihua shirting flannel has increased in price to 4 jiao and 5 fen per yard, while the red market was only 3 jiao and 7 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Dong Piece Fine Cloth and Fine Twill: Due to the continued strong dyeing sales in this street, yesterday's spot trade volume reached a huge 1,500 to 1,600 pieces. Market sentiment is soaring, and the price per piece has increased sharply by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao. Various foreign firms have also placed orders for more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth futures for next month. The asking price for fine twill is too high, making it difficult to approach. The April futures price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 12 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. The price for Wufu Trumpet per piece is 12 yuan and 1 jiao. The opening amount is the largest for Flying Fish fine cloth, totaling more than 700 pieces, with a price ranging from 12 yuan and 2 jiao to 12 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per piece.</p>
<p>Today's piece goods exports: 210 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 7 pieces to Xiamen, 200 pieces to Quanzhou, and 670 pieces to Ningbo.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Life of Female Office Workers</h3>
<p>— Hai Xiao</p>
<p>In the current surging wave of unemployment, female office workers in women's professions are indeed a very important occupational sector. In the currently abnormally prosperous Shanghai, although the total number of female office workers has not been accurately counted, a rough estimate suggests that there are at least around 100,000! Most of them work in smaller department stores. However, what the author knows and wants to report on here is still about the larger department stores. Let's first talk about their treatment.</p>
<p>The treatment of female office workers may be imagined by people as being very wealthy. They are hidden in tall skyscrapers, surrounded by luxurious decorations. In the bitterly cold winter, they have the warmth of hot water heating, and in the hot summer, they also have the coolness of air conditioning. Their clothes are also fashionable: they have permed airplane-style loose hair, and they wear high-heeled leather shoes. Indeed, in appearance, everyone thinks that female office workers in large companies are very affluent! Their salaries are quite considerable! But the reality is beyond our expectations, and they have endless grievances to tell!</p>
<p>I once heard a female office worker's complaint: "Eating company food is like sitting in a long-term free prison!" From this complaint, we can already understand their situation.</p>
<p>The daily business hours are usually from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm. Excluding meal times, they spend almost ten hours a day rigidly guarding the "counters" (which may be the prison bars in the eyes of female office workers). Even during idle times, they cannot sneak out for a moment, because customers may visit at any time. If you happen to be away, you must be careful of the supervisor's "scolding," unless you are good at flattering and the supervisor will not forgive you. Therefore, even when you are extremely bored every day, you must stick to your post and can only pace back and forth like a polar bear within the confines of the counter, waiting for customers to arrive. When your legs are sore and tired, you cannot sit on a cold bench for too long, because you must pay more attention to the occasional inspections of the boss and manager.</p>
<p>The busiest time of day is usually around three or four o'clock in the afternoon. When customers swarm in, your hands and brain must be agile, without being flustered or slow. Otherwise, if you miscalculate the money for the day, you must pay for the mistake at the price, which is an undeniable responsibility. If you are a little slow, you may escape the supervisor's "scolding," but the customers' "scolding" may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Serving customers requires being attentive and considerate, with a welcoming smile on your face; you must be gentle and polite. Only in this way can you attract the customers' money into your hands and then transfer it into the boss's pocket. If you serve customers always stiffly, taking one step for each instruction, answering one question for each question, then frankly speaking, you are not qualified to be an ideal female office worker in the eyes of the boss's business.</p>
<p>Customers who come to the counter do not always make a purchase. Some find the price too expensive and cannot afford it, while others do not buy because of poor service. But there is another type of customer who deliberately does not buy and looks for trouble, which is the most troublesome type of customer for every female office worker. They wear well-tailored Western suits, shiny leather shoes, and glasses, and they walk up as if they are important, asking you to take out this and that. This is not good, and that is not good. Their eyes dart back and forth like mice, and they chatter and harass you for a long time before shamelessly running away. What kind of customers are these? To be honest, they are just the general "Hu Tiao" friends in Shanghai, who are the insults that every female office worker often suffers. In the mouths of these "Hu Tiao" friends, the term "female office worker" has been replaced by something like "vase," which is such an insult! How malicious!</p>
<p>However, in the minds of the general young customers, the service of female office workers seems to be more favorable than that of male office workers, and the attraction is greater. Therefore, female office workers have unconsciously become a type of advertisement utilized by general clever businessmen. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3>Opening Chapter of National Heroes</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>A certain elder, the former director of the Wu County Library, seeing that after the fall of his hometown, a portion of the people had been anesthetized and recognized the invaders as their fathers, willing to be puppets, narrated the stories of national heroes from the past and composed an opening chapter, asking ballad singers to broadcast it through stringed instruments so that the audience would know whom to admire. The words are earnest and sincere, and worthy of promotion. The narratives are generally in vernacular Chinese, so they can be widely disseminated. Two excerpts are recorded below, which patriotic compatriots will also be happy to hear.</p>
<p>(1) Shi Kefa</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Kefa was from Xiangfu County, Henan Province. His courtesy name was Xianzhi, and he was also called Daolin. He was a Jinshi during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty, and his official position reached Minister of War. After Li Zicheng invaded Beijing and Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill, Mr. Shi fainted several times in grief. He then raised troops and crossed the river to prepare to resist the Manchus. Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng, and others used force to support Prince Fu and resented Mr. Shi's loyalty and integrity. They appointed him as Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent and Minister of War, and sent him to Yangzhou to supervise the army, serving as the commander-in-chief of Huaibei, Sishui, Linhuai, and Luzhou, to restrain him. Dorgon, the regent of the Manchu Qing, wrote a letter persuading him to surrender. Mr. Shi replied, refusing. Later, the Qing army besieged Yangzhou. After five days, the city of Yangzhou fell. Mr. Shi was captured and refused to submit, so he was killed by the Qing soldiers. The Manchus hated Mr. Shi and hated the people of Yangzhou, so they sent troops to slaughter them for ten days. After the city of Nanjing fell and Prince Fu fled, the people of Yangzhou commemorated Mr. Shi and buried his clothes and hat on Meihualing outside the Tianning Temple gate. Don't you think Mr. Shi is very admirable?</p>
<p>Ten thousand cold plums bloom with blood, Commander Shi, the pillar of the Central Plains, a great general. Look at the record of the ten-day massacre, a terrible disaster for Yangzhou. In those years, after Emperor Chongzhen ascended the throne, a group of courtiers were mediocre. There were many corrupt officials. It has always been said that military officials want their lives, and civil officials want money. Once the rebel Li Zicheng raised troops, capturing the capital, it was indeed dangerous. The soldiers were exhausted and the pay was cut off, and no one cared whether the Jingyang Palace was hit several times. Alas, Emperor Sizong hanged himself on Coal Hill, the earth shattered and the sky collapsed. Minister Shi heard the news and cried loudly, and the loyal army crossed the river to rescue the emperor. National heroes rose up together, the sound of war drums like thunder. How hateful, Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng, and a group of traitors fought for power, supporting Prince Fu and brewing disaster. And Wu Sangui borrowed Qing troops, a great traitor who opened the door to invite the enemy. Causing him, the heroes had no place to use their strength, and Shi Kefa was surrounded. The Ming Dynasty's empire disappeared. So many loyal ministers and righteous people sacrificed themselves. To this day, on Meihualing, his spirit and soul are buried forever, lingering outside Tianning gate.</p>
<h3>"On the Usefulness of Scholars"</h3>
<p>— Ge'er</p>
<p>"Scholars are useless," the "uselessness" of cultural people is not just now. "Life begins with recognizing characters confused," therefore, "characters" cannot be truly "recognized," which is a clear annotation to "scholars are useless." Everyone knows that "confused" people are "useless."</p>
<p>Now is the time of the War of Resistance, "abandoning the pen and joining the army" is admired by everyone, which is another clear proof that the "pen" is ultimately inferior to the "gun." Therefore, some people, looking at the cultural people who are making grand pronouncements in newspapers and magazines, cannot help but despise them and say, "If you have the guts, go to the front line, staying in the rear and nagging is verbal resistance, this is the depravity of cultural people!" Therefore, "scholars" are still "useless," but the tone has changed.</p>
<p>However, are "scholars" really "useless"? I say "yes" and "no." Isn't this a contradiction? In fact, everything in the world is contradictory. There is a "good" side, and there must be a "bad" side. Some "scholars" are "useless," but it cannot be denied that some are also "useful." Otherwise, why did Mr. Lu Xun, who was studying to be a doctor, abandon medicine and engage in literary work? Just with a copy of Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" in my hand, it is said to be an "apocalypse" for young men and women in 19th-century Old Russia. This is only in the literary aspect, and the same is true for social sciences.</p>
<p>Picking out the uselessness of cultural people, despising the "pen" and valuing the "gun," such people can be said to have only one eye and only see one side of everything in the world, and there is a real need for correction.</p>
<p>In fact, some cultural people are indeed "useless." What they write under their pen is not only not beneficial to the country and society, but is actually harmful, which can be said to be beyond "useless." There is also a kind of "bookworm" who holds books and reads to death, nitpicking and pedantic, displaying a complete "scholarly air." The phrase "life begins with recognizing characters confused" is perfect for them. Because such people only see the "dogma" on the books and do not see the turbulent world outside the books. Using "dogma" to measure the turbulent world, their eyes are blurred, and they feel a bit "confused." If a pedantic old man uses Confucius and Mencius's doctrines to evaluate modern women, he will definitely be "confused" and will definitely "begin to worry," shaking his head and sighing, "The world is going downhill."</p>
<p>Such "cultural people" can be said to be "useless." And in the War of Resistance, I don't think there is any need to seek any help from them. However, this is only the "bad" side, and to erase the combativeness of all cultural people from this "bad" side is either "ignorance" or "malice."</p>
<p>The Guilin telegram of the 15th of this month said that General Bai Chongxi, the director of the Southwest Military Headquarters, hosted cultural figures on the 10th and gave a speech, stating that "this war against Japan is a war of resistance and a war of response. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the way to win depends on total war in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, fighting against the enemy. The work of cultural people, although biased in the rear, is no less helpful to the War of Resistance than the heroic soldiers shedding blood on the front lines." The "usefulness" of cultural people can be said to be a clear proof from General Bai. General Bai also pointed out that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, our side takes a defensive stance in military affairs and an offensive stance in political affairs. Therefore, this shows that the pen of cultural people can be said to be the most excellent weapon in strengthening the spirit of the people.</p>
<p>We will not be "useless" "scholars," nor will we be "confused" by recognizing characters. We will not listen to other people's "nonsense." We will shoulder our "pens" and unleash our fighting spirit. In short, we are "cultural people" who are no less than the heroic soldiers shedding blood on the front lines!</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "The Honolulu Murder Case"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Produced by 20th Century Fox, playing at the Grand Light Cinema</p>
<p>After Warner Oland passed away, the so-called "Chinese detective Charlie Chan" also had two versions. One is our "domestic product," Mr. Xu Shengyuan, and Mr. Xu Xinfu's "The Pearl Shirt" was promoted with "Charlie Chan's First Major Murder Case in China"; the other is Mr. Sidney Toler, whom 20th Century Fox specially sought out as Warner Oland's "successor." These two gentlemen have different nationalities and appearances, but their makeup is consistent, based on Warner Oland, as if Warner Oland was the real "Chinese detective Charlie Chan."</p>
<p>We have seen Xu Shengyuan's Charlie Chan, so let's not mention it. How about that Mr. Sidney Toler? Is his style, like his makeup, inheriting Warner Oland's consistent style?</p>
<p>The answer is: yes, but also no. What does this mean? Yes, he tries very hard to learn Warner Oland's slow, deliberate movements and pronunciation (is this a characteristic of Chinese people? Wrong!). No, because he is ultimately not Warner Oland, so all movements and pronunciation are faster than Warner Oland, but he also loses Oland's depth. From the perspective of our own Chinese people, he seems even less like Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>"The Honolulu Murder Case" begins with a family reunion at Charlie Chan's home, starting with the imminent birth of his eldest daughter, and ending with the birth of his eldest daughter's son, with a "murder case" inserted in between. The Charlie Chan detective series, based on its title and cast, was originally destined to be a "continuous good show." Now that we have been introduced to his sons, daughters, wife, and sons-in-law, and with his personal affairs as the beginning and end, it seems that there is a trend towards writing a biography of Charlie Chan. Naturally, this is based on a "business perspective." If there is business, then "Little Charlie Chan's birth" may not be impossible to turn into a script, because in "The Honolulu Murder Case," there are already two sons with their father's aspirations.</p>
<p>The background of "The Honolulu Murder Case" is on a ship, so the characteristics of Honolulu, where the murder occurred, are absent. In addition to the "detective" as the backbone of the whole play, there are some elements of horror and grotesqueness interspersed, such as Dr. Cardigan, who studies human brains, the wild beast locked in a cage, and the lion-taming crew.</p>
<p>The scriptwriting and directing techniques are not particularly strong. There are some red herrings in the detective film (such as the somewhat grotesque Dr. Cardigan, but based on the experience of watching many detective films, we know that the more suspicious a character is, the less likely they are to be the killer, so our interest in Cardigan decreases). However, there are no clues to solve the case, waiting for a hidden camera to take photos, and then Charlie Chan explains it, which is not enough.</p>
<p>Sun Yong, who plays Charlie's son Jamie, has no other tricks besides flicking his eyes. His face is terrifying, which is contrary to the style of his father, Mr. Charlie; on the other hand, Charlie's fifth son, although small, seems more natural in his performance.</p>
<h3>Rain After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Praising a Prodigy, One Seed Bears Three Blossoms; Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Among Heroes</p>
<p>He Shuangyu asked, "Are those three children still here?" Zhu Airen replied, "Of course they are. We're giving them special care. When they were born, although they were a little smaller than other babies, they still weighed between five and a half and five and three-quarters pounds. It's really amazing how their mother's belly could hold them all. After these triplets were born, as soon as it was published in the newspaper, many people were stirred up and wanted to come and see them. Later, we politely declined everyone, not allowing anyone to visit. Imagine how troublesome it would be if people were coming to visit all day long, and it wouldn't be good for the babies either. Actually, there's nothing much to see. It's just that normally, one person gives birth to one child, but this time she gave birth to three. These three are just like ordinary people, they don't have extra hands or legs. But people are always curious. Some who know Doctor Zhang Yi or know me have asked to see the children. Under the condition that it doesn't bother them, we have to lead people to see them, so they've received quite a few gifts!" He Liyu said, "Don't say people are curious, I want to go see them too. Where are the three children now? When were they born? How old are they now?" Zhu Airen said, "When they were first born, they were originally in our hospital. After they turned one month old, the mother and children were supposed to go home. But Officer Fang's wife's health wasn't very good after the birth. How could she manage to raise three children on her own? It's not just about breastfeeding them, even just looking after them would be very tiring. And their family doesn't have the extra resources to hire wet nurses and caregivers. At this time, the local community thought that triplets were an unusual occurrence, so the village self-government association was willing to subsidize the cost of raising them every year. Our old Doctor Zhang also believed that these triplets were born in our hospital, and that our hospital's nursing care was excellent, ensuring the safety of both mother and children, which is an honor for our hospital. If Officer Fang and his wife were willing to entrust the children to our hospital for care, it would be good because we have an infant care center here, and we would be willing to fulfill our duty. Later, it was decided that the village self-government association would subsidize half of the cost, and our infant care center would fulfill half of the duty. Now, the three children are already eighteen months old. They can walk and talk, they're very lively and cute, and everyone who sees them likes them. Their parents come to see them once or twice a month. At first, they felt like their own children were now being raised publicly, as if the children didn't belong to them. Later, our Doctor Zhang guided them, saying, 'The children are still your children. We're just helping you raise them to save you trouble.'" (64)</p>

<h3>A Record of an Interview with Wang Xianzai, an Artist Who Fled with the Long March in Sichuan and Yunnan, Upon His Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xin Shi</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xianzai, the leader of the "Shanghai Film Actors Troupe," who engaged in drama propaganda work during the Long March into Sichuan the year before last, has recently returned safely north to the isolated island after enduring hardship and experiencing a year and a half of exile in Chengdu, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guizhou. The day before yesterday, I shook hands with him, exchanged news of our separation, and rejoiced that we were both unharmed. I couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment from the world. Mr. Wang has been famous in the film industry for nearly twenty years. He is a veteran villain, whose image has been deeply engraved in the minds of every audience, and he is known for his superb acting skills. The details of his journey are naturally of concern to every moviegoer. We had previously described the troupe's journey in an article titled "Sun Min Returns from Kunming" a month ago, so this interview will only cover some of Mr. Wang's thoughts and other related topics.</p>
<p>Playing the Villain Causes Disadvantages Everywhere</p>
<p>After the "Shanghai Film Actors Troupe" arrived in Chongqing in October of the year before last, almost all of the troupe's external affairs were handled by him alone. Because in Sichuan, the films of the Mingxing Film Company have always been the most popular; only he and Gong Jianong are the well-known veteran actors; others such as Ms. Bai Yang and other newcomers are generally unfamiliar to the locals. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, he could only take on the title of leader and do more work. But because he often plays villains on the screen, the people of Sichuan really regarded him as an "unpardonable" treacherous figure, which sometimes made them wary of him, hindering his actions and making things difficult. In a state of both anger and amusement, he himself believed that he was getting his just deserts for playing so many evil roles on the screen. Therefore, he suffered a lot in his work, which was a great joke.</p>
<p>Disagreements Arise, Troupe Splits</p>
<p>When the large group of film actors first set out on their expedition to Sichuan, everyone had a passion, intending only to fulfill their duties, and no one had any desire for fame or fortune. Therefore, everyone in the troupe, from the leading actors to the laborers, shared the hardships and enjoyed the rewards together, and there was no distinction in treatment. Everyone's initial desire was only to maintain a minimum standard of living. Later, the performances were surprisingly successful, and after deducting all expenses, the troupe even had a surplus of more than one hundred yuan per month, which was a pleasant surprise and made them even more excited. But after finishing the performances in Chongqing and moving on to Chengdu, the performance of the patriotic play "Thirty Million Refugees" went beyond the ordinary and caused misunderstandings with the local authorities, leading to a great deal of trouble. After that, disagreements arose within the troupe, and it split into two organizations. Bai Yang, Shen Fu, and more than twenty others reorganized into the "Chengdu Troupe." Wang Xianzai, Sun Min, Gong Jianong, Ma Shouhong, Yuan Zhuru, Zhu Manhua, and other seven men and women withdrew and formed the "Sullivan Troupe." Both groups continued to perform in Chengdu, gradually deciding to perform more professional dramas. After performing like this for more than two months, and resting there for a long time, this small troupe of seven finally made its way to Kunming in early winter of last year. The "Chengdu Troupe," with the exception of Bai Yang and a few others who immediately joined the Central Film Studio, later merged with the "Amateur Troupe" and gave long-term performances.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhuru Finds a Good Match on the Journey</p>
<p>Ms. Yuan Zhuru, a female troupe member, was originally an old colleague of his at the Mingxing Film Company. During the perilous journey of thousands of miles, they took care of each other along the way, and their feelings grew closer, gradually leading them to fall in love. Miss Yuan is dignified and serene, and a young unmarried woman; he is also an old widower who has been "celibate" for thirteen years. Therefore, their "heaven-made match" resulted in a wedding comedy in Chengdu on January 15 last year. At that time, they held a grand banquet for their guests, and the scene was extremely lively. Miss Yuan's family is from Kunming, Yunnan, and later, after arriving there, she even returned to her hometown with him to sweep her parents' tombs and pay respects, which was considered fulfilling a little of her filial piety. Recently, after the couple returned to Shanghai together, many friends in the film industry celebrated their good fortune and asked them to treat them to wedding wine. They have also prepared to host a banquet at a set time, but in the current environment, they will absolutely not make any extravagant displays.</p>
<p>Thoughts of Home Stirred by Local News in the Entertainment World</p>
<p>From Chengdu, they went to Kunming, where they performed at the New Yunnan Opera House for more than seventy days, performing seven plays including "The Luminous Cup," "Drunk Life, Dream Death," "Thunderstorm," and "Sunrise," and the situation was very good. Originally, after Sun Min and Gong Jianong finished performing there and returned to Shanghai first, they were planning to go to Guiyang again. At that time, Guiyang was bombed by enemy planes on February 4, and the city was affected, so everyone was quite hesitant. Also, they happened to see the article "Sun Min Returns from Kunming" in the "Entertainment World" section of the Shen Bao, and knowing that there were no obstacles to returning to Shanghai, they couldn't help but feel homesick. That's when they decided to travel with Miss Zhu Manhua and two others, taking the route through Haiphong and returning to Shanghai via Hong Kong. According to Mr. Wang, the only Shanghai newspaper available in Kunming was the "Shen Bao," which was very popular; but it always arrived ten days late, which made the travelers anxious and constantly longing for it.</p>
<p>Various Parties Compete for His Services, Future Undecided</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is the only master at playing villain roles on the silver screen. For more than ten years, no one has been able to compete with him, and he still maintains the highest position in this field. In the current situation where monsters and ghosts are rampant, these negative portrayals that expose evil are precisely what he needs to depict on the screen to show the greatest power of leaving nowhere to hide. Regarding his future plans, he is being courted by various parties and is finding it difficult to decide. On the one hand, he was contacted earlier by "Xinhua" and "Mingxing" and doesn't want to refuse them; on the other hand, he feels it would be difficult to break off the long-standing relationship with his old hosts. Therefore, he is hesitant and has not yet been able to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Performers' Activities</h3>
<p>The Truth Behind Huang Guiqiu's Suspension of Performances: Since the appearance of the famous Dan Huang Guiqiu on the Tianchan Stage, business has been mediocre. To remedy this, the stage owner, Gu Zhuxuan, specifically reduced seat prices to make them more accessible to the common people and easier to attract audiences. Guiqiu, however, believed that this was detrimental to her reputation because she had not been consulted beforehand. Thus, the other day, she suddenly claimed to be unwell and in need of rest, refusing to perform and moving out of the actors' dormitory at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, to a friend's place on Aigre Road in the French Concession. After receiving this news, Gu sent Zhang Jianfei and Chang Yunheng with 2,000 yuan in performance fees to Huang's place to negotiate, but they returned without success. That evening, the play "June Snow," which had been scheduled to be performed, was replaced by Kun Dan Xue Youqin. Xue Niang's artistry has long been appreciated by the people of Shanghai, and no accidents occurred. The applause was endless, and she was a great success. It is said that Guiqiu, after suffering such a miserable failure in Shanghai, cried like Ruan Lang, vowing never to perform here again. However, Tianchan is still in negotiations with her, hoping that she will continue to perform after she recovers.</p>
<p>Wang Fuying Reported Back to Work Yesterday: Since leaving the Gongwu Stage and joining Tianchan, the martial artist Wang Fuying has been very popular with audiences. When asked about his future, he replied, "I'll just muddle through wherever I am." Recently, he caught a slight cold and felt unwell, so he applied for a day off from the authorities the other day to rest. He has recovered slightly and reported back to work yesterday, performing in the play "Jiaxing Prefecture." Zhou Xinfang and Others Busy with Spring Banquets: Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, Wang Xichun, Jin Suwen, Liu Wenkui, Zhang Huicong, and others from the Yifeng Troupe at the Carlton Theater held a dinner party at Jinjiang Restaurant at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. Zhou Xinfang is scheduled to host a spring banquet for all the performers at the Daya Restaurant today, and leading actors such as Gao Baisui are also planning to take turns holding celebratory events.</p>
<p>Zhang Meiying Returns to Shanghai by Ship: Zhang Meiying, the eldest daughter of Zhang Liankui, the backstage manager of the Dajing Troupe at the Xianshi Amusement Park, has been studying under the tutelage of Wu Yaoqing in Peiping for several months. She returned to Shanghai from Peiping on the Shuntian ship the other day and visited old friends backstage at Xianshi that evening. It has not yet been decided whether she will return north.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (124)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>When Zhuge Liang Executed Ma Su, He Also Brought Along the Interrogation of Li Qi</p>
<p>One year, when Lao Tan performed "Empty City" and "Executing Ma Su," Li Shoushan played Ma Su. While Lao Tan was putting on his makeup backstage, he smiled and said to his colleagues backstage, "Today I'm singing 'Executing Ma Su,' and I'm also bringing along an interrogation of Li Qi." Everyone was baffled. Who knew that when it came time to push Ma Su out for execution, Old Li Qi laughed loudly three times to the sky. Lao Tan then called him back and asked, "General, why are you laughing?" Shoushan never expected Lao Tan to ask such a question and was immediately dumbfounded, unable to answer a single word. How could he not be booed? Fortunately, Lao Tan said, "Quickly push him out and execute him," which saved Li Qi. If not, he would not have been spared until he answered the reason for his laughter. But at this time, Ma Su regretted his carelessness and deserved to be punished. He also thought about his eighty-year-old mother at home, whom he could not take care of. In this situation, he couldn't even cry, let alone laugh loudly three times. Moreover, Ma Su's killing was because he admitted his guilt and died without resentment, which was very different from the execution of Shan Xiongxin in the "Locking the Dragon" (Wu Chang mistakenly written as Wu) play. Xiongxin had a vendetta against Li Shimin for killing his brother and repeatedly disrupted the Tang Dynasty. After he was captured, the brothers of Wagang Village all came forward to offer wine and sacrifices. Xiongxin deliberately made a heroic statement: "In twenty years, I will be reborn again." Therefore, Xiongxin could laugh three times when he was executed to show that he didn't care about life and death. His laugh was directed at his great enemy Li Shimin and everyone else, as if to say, "Your Grandpa Shan doesn't care about this knife." Therefore, his laugh was appropriate and in line with the plot. In the play "Executing Ma Su," no matter who played Ma Su, no one had ever heard of laughing three times. Only this restless, rule-breaking Big Li Qi, at will, arbitrarily added three laughs to this play. In the past, when he sang with other old Sheng, people didn't bother to argue with him and let him mess around. Today, he was unlucky and ran into Old Tan, who was serious about acting and full of tricks, who deliberately and suddenly called him back twice to ask him the reason for his laughter, which made him a big cripple. This was something he never expected in his dreams. Lao Tan first said "Executing Ma Su' bring an interrogation of Li Qi,'" everyone was confused and didn't know what was going on. It wasn't until the play was over that everyone understood that Lao Tan's "interrogation of Li Qi" was actually interrogating Big Li Qi.</p>
<h3>This Year's Wishes of Hollywood Movie Stars</h3>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Reading and Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Wei Hua</p>
<p>Children: You must have heard your parents or teachers tell stories like these: Studying by the light of snow! Studying with fireflies in a bag! Chipping a hole in the wall to steal light! Hanging one's head from the beam and stabbing one's thigh! These people's diligence in studying is certainly admirable, but should we learn from them? Children: I must tell you: We should never learn from them, because these studying methods are the most unhygienic! That is to say, they are most harmful to the body!</p>
<p>Let's talk about studying by the light of snow first! Although the color of snow is white, it must still be blurry when it shines on the words at night. This is very harmful to our eyes. The eyes are the most important thing in the human body. If your eyes are damaged, that would be such an unfortunate thing! That brother who studied by the light of snow did so because he didn't have money to buy oil for a lamp. If you can study under an electric light now, that's certainly very good; otherwise, you'd rather not study. Damaging your eyes is not a good thing!</p>
<p>In addition, borrowing the light of fireflies to study is also not good. It's not easy to catch many fireflies, and even if you can catch them, the light is likely to be very weak.</p>
<p>Let's talk about chipping a hole in the wall to steal light. If you don't have lamplight to study by, you can try to sit by a street lamp and read, or you can go somewhere else to find lamplight; chipping a hole in the wall is always not a good thing. Just imagine how unsightly it is to have a hole dug in the wall!</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about "hanging one's head from the beam and stabbing one's thigh." Do you understand the meaning of these six characters? This means that a person in the past studied very diligently and didn't sleep at night. But after working for a long time, people will always be tired; their eyes will naturally close, and their heads will naturally lower. To prevent his head from lowering, this person tied his hair to the beam with a rope, and to prevent himself from falling asleep, he often stabbed his buttocks and thighs with an awl. Look how foolish this person is! What's the use of such diligence? We know that adults need eight hours of sleep every day, and children need at least ten hours of sleep every day; not sleeping is absolutely not allowed, and our knowledge is not only in books—nature is our greatest school!</p>
<h3>The Founder of the Boy Scouts, Baden-Powell</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlü</p>
<p>Children who have been Boy Scouts all know Baden-Powell. He is the founder of the Boy Scouts, so every Boy Scout remembers him deeply. The day before yesterday, when we commemorated Chinese Boy Scout Day, we especially couldn't forget him.</p>
<p>He was a very brave and intelligent British soldier who lived a hard life in the army, exposed to the elements and sleeping in the open. But he had a spirit of endurance and hard work, and didn't feel the hardship of life.</p>
<p>When the war between Britain and South Africa broke out in 1899, he stepped onto the battlefield. Although Britain had an advantage in this war, he always felt that the British soldiers were far less hardworking and enduring than the African soldiers. He also knew that this habit of hard work and endurance needed to be cultivated in childhood.</p>
<p>So, in 1907, he gathered a group of lively children and formed the Boy Scouts; on a secluded island, he began to conduct various training exercises. In just a few months, the results were very good. Everyone became strong and healthy children who could serve society, and they became known to the general public. The Boy Scout movement spread from Britain to the whole world.</p>
<p>Children: Please tell your friends who can't afford to go to school. Hurry up and register for classes at the Obligatory Elementary School on the second floor of No. 4 Fuxingli, next to the World Book Company on Simalu. Tuition is free, and books and stationery are provided.</p>

<h3>Precious Morning</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yan</p>
<p>Dear children, do you like "sleeping in"? I think you must like it. Especially on winter mornings, sleeping in a warm bed is so comfortable! But children! Do you know the ancient sayings "The plan for a year lies in spring, the plan for a day lies in morning"? Morning is the most precious time of day, because the air is exceptionally fresh at this time, and our minds are very alert after a night's rest. If we read or write at this time, we will make progress very quickly, and getting up early every day to breathe some fresh air is also very beneficial to our health. Children! Are you willing to waste such a precious morning? If you're not willing, then start forming the habit of getting up early from today onwards, don't be greedy for the warm bed, and let the precious morning be wasted in vain.</p>
<p>Many children like to read or write at night, which is very bad, because after a day of work, a person's energy is very exhausted by the evening. If you read at this time, no matter how hard you work, your progress will definitely be very slow. For example, sometimes you can't figure out a difficult math problem no matter how hard you try, but if you think about it again tomorrow morning, you can easily figure it out. This proves that the mind is much more alert in the morning than in the evening, so children who like to read at night! Quickly change your habits, go to bed early at night, get up early in the morning, and do the homework you need to do at night in the morning. If you can follow the above instructions and continue to do so, I think your knowledge will definitely improve very quickly. Perhaps you can get first place this semester. When you take the prize and the certificate home and receive praise from your father and mother, will you feel happy in your heart at that time?</p>
<p>Dear children! Do you want to get prizes and certificates? Hurry up and study hard in the precious morning!</p>
<h3>Being a Little Wireless Radio Enthusiast (5)</h3>
<p>— Xi Ren</p>
<p>3. Antenna and Ground Wire</p>
<p>"So, what is an antenna made of?" Wang Min, after looking at the antennas on the roofs of the houses around the small garden for a while, asked his cousin. Wang Min had this habit; when he didn't understand something, he had to ask until he understood it clearly.</p>
<p>"You can buy antennas in wireless radio shops; we don't need to make them ourselves. But I can tell you what things are used to make an antenna: An antenna is made by twisting many copper wires (about seven to eight strands) together into one, then attaching the previously mentioned insulators to both ends, and then stretching it out on the roof."</p>
<p>After Wang Min's cousin finished that long explanation, he paused for a moment, rubbed his hands together, looked up at the sky, and suddenly remembered something, saying urgently to Wang Min: "I almost forgot to tell you, there's another style of antenna."</p>
<p>"What style is it?" Wang Min asked quickly.</p>
<p>"Slow down, let me tell you slowly. When it comes to installing a wireless radio, it also depends on the location. For example, in Shanghai, every street is filled with dense buildings, making it very difficult to string up an antenna, unlike in the open countryside, where there's open space on all sides, making it very easy to string up an antenna. In such a situation, we have to think of a small and space-saving antenna. Because this antenna is placed inside the house, we call it an indoor antenna, and because its shape resembles a spider's web, we also call it a spider web antenna.</p>
<p>"I've never seen this kind of antenna before!" Wang Min said.</p>
<p>"How would you see it? People keep them in their rooms. Look, there's a picture in this book that shows this spider web antenna." Wang Min's cousin casually picked up a book and pointed to a photo inside for Wang Min to see (see Figure 5).</p>
<p>"There's also a frame in this picture."</p>
<p>"Yes, the entire antenna body is mounted on a frame, and this frame is movable, able to turn around in all directions."</p>
<p>"Why does it need to turn around? Wouldn't it be better if it was fixed?" Wang Min always asked about things he didn't understand, but his cousin didn't find it troublesome and always patiently explained to him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, it could originally be fixed and not moved, but you have to know that an antenna installed inside a house will receive less electricity than one outside. So we must make this antenna movable, turning it around in all directions until the loudest sound comes out of the radio, and then fix it in place." He paused, then said, "As for antennas, I think that's all I can say. Now we can talk about ground wires."</p>
<p>"There's a ground wire after having an antenna?" Wang Min found it very strange.</p>
<p>"A ground wire is also an important component in a wireless radio, especially in the crystal radio we'll be trying to assemble soon. It can make a big difference in loudness."</p>
<p>"The antenna is installed in the air, so the ground wire must be installed underground?"</p>
<p>"That's right!" his cousin said. "The ground wire is installed underground. The common way to install it is to drive a long iron rod into the ground, and then connect a wire from that iron rod to the radio."</p>

<p>Spring Special</p>
<h3>Spring Has Come</h3>
<p>— Zheng Benren, 6th Grade Student at Early Spring Elementary School</p>
<p>The god of spring has descended! All living things in the universe are joyfully welcoming it. It adorns the withered and haggard earth, making it as beautiful as a woman. God of spring! How great is your power!</p>
<p>Listen! The lovely and lively little birds are singing spring songs on the branches, seemingly urging people to quickly get to work and not waste this joyful spring.</p>
<p>Look! Many plants are sprouting fresh leaves and blooming beautiful flowers. All these sights express the joy of spring! Ah! Gentle weather, beautiful scenery, how lovely spring is!</p>
<p>This lovely spring brings such beautiful scenery, presenting scene after scene for us to see, making our bodies and minds comfortable and our spirits happy. How should we thank it?</p>
<p>Classmates! The year's plan lies in spring. Now that spring has arrived, let us quickly work hard in a timely manner!</p>
<h3>Spring and Reading</h3>
<p>— Guo Yusheng, 4th Grade Student at National Light Elementary School</p>
<p>The withered grass of winter is now thriving, and the old trees on the roadsides are also sprouting new buds. The insects and birds are also stirring and lively. Humans, known as the most intelligent of all creatures, naturally feel very happy in this spring. However, lovely spring still passes like a fleeting moment. The ancients said, "The year's plan lies in spring," so we should study with extra diligence in this gentle and warm spring. Otherwise, we will have to wait another year to have this bright spring light.</p>
<p>Among the seasons of the year, the one in which we find reading most interesting and make the most progress is none other than spring, right? In summer, there is sultry sunlight; in autumn, there are noisy insect sounds; in the depths of winter, there is piercing north wind. So, let's work hard at reading. Besides spring, what other season is there?</p>
<p>Work hard! Friends! Don't waste this spring.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Spring</h3>
<p>— Yang Sheng, 6th Grade Student at Shanghai Elementary School</p>
<p>Spring has come again! The warm spring sunlight has driven away the cruel winter! We are listening to the birds singing melodious songs under the bright sunshine and watching the flowers and plants gradually grow in the soil. Ah! How happy we are!</p>
<p>But I have gained a thought from the arrival of spring:</p>
<p>The cruel cold we encounter is just like the setbacks we encounter when doing things. The arrival of spring is just like the success we achieve in doing things. We endure the cold, and then we can enjoy the warmth of spring. This is telling us that "when doing things, overcome all difficulties and endure all failures, and then you will get a satisfactory result."</p>
<p>Little friends! Don't play anymore! Wait until your own or your country's career gets a satisfactory result, and then celebrate greatly!</p>
<h3>Spring in My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Ma Yuanyong, 6th Grade Student at Zhendong Elementary School</p>
<p>The spring of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] has descended upon the world. Undoubtedly, another year has begun. Spring is like a gentle maiden, and also like a loving old mother. She gives us warm wind and gentle sunlight. All living things on the earth, after being nurtured by spring, grow vigorously and sprout. People also receive the baptism of spring light and feel a hundred times more energetic. Spring has no bias at all, and it steps equally into my hometown, which is trampled under the iron hooves [of the Japanese invaders]. Thinking of my hometown cannot help but make me feel sorrowful. I remember on this day two years ago, a group of us children, under the protection of the god of spring, went on a spring outing in the suburbs. At that time, the peach blossoms were red and the willows were green; how beautiful it was! But now? The beautiful hometown only has some broken bricks and tiles and a scorched earth left. It's not as lovely as before. Moreover, several of our little friends have either died or run away. There is no chance to meet again. Heavens! Who has deprived us of all the rights of spring? The spring of my hometown cannot be appreciated anymore.</p>
<h3>Small Things</h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>A very high wall is built of many bricks. A very long journey is completed by taking many "steps," one after another. If there were no bricks, there would be no high wall. If you are unwilling to take even one step, you cannot complete even a short journey.</p>
<p>Let's use even bigger things as metaphors: A high mountain is formed by accumulating many pieces of soil. If there were no pieces of soil, where would the high mountain come from? The water in the vast ocean is accumulated drop by drop. If there were no drops of water, where would the vast ocean come from?</p>
<p>Some children say: One copper coin can't buy anything significant, so it's better to spend it casually. Some children say: Getting up twenty minutes early every morning still doesn't allow me to get any work done, so it's better not to get up early at all. But one copper coin every day, accumulated for a year, amounts to one yuan and two jiao. Reading two pages of a book every day allows you to finish a very thick book in a year.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Do not fail to do good because the benefit is small, and do not do evil because the harm is small." This means that if there is a good deed, even if the benefit from doing it is very small, you should not fail to do it because the benefit is small. If there is an evil deed, even if the harm from doing it is very small, you should not do it because the harm is small.</p>
<p>Seeing a banana peel on the ground, picking it up, although the benefit is very small, may have saved an old person. Donating one cent to the refugee donation, although the benefit is very small, may have prevented a refugee child from starving to death. Spitting phlegm on the ground, although it seems that the harm is very small, may have caused many people to get sick because of your phlegm.</p>
<h3>Jiangshan Boat</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Ming'er's Refugee Diary, No. 16—</p>
<p>That huge boat sailed towards the upper reaches of the vast Qiantang River. The small trees on both sides of the river, far away, were short and uneven. Ming'er looked at them and felt a little blurry, as if the trees were spinning and receding backwards. This was because the boat was moving forward. The river water kept hitting the hull of the boat, turning into snow-white waves, and in an instant, they disappeared without a trace, while also emitting a burst of splashing sounds.</p>
<p>It was the first time for Ming'er to live on a boat, and he had never ridden on such a large boat that used manpower to move forward. After asking his father, he learned that it was called a Jiangshan boat. Therefore, he felt that this opportunity was very rare. If it weren't for fleeing the disaster, who would be happy to ride on such a clumsy and slow boat?</p>
<p>The boat was made of fir wood, and the boatmen cherished it very much because it was their only lifeline. Therefore, they painted a layer of yellowish tung oil all over the boat, and there was not a trace of mud on it. This showed a very clean and simple appearance. The boat shed was made of reeds and bamboo strips, and it covered the boat in a semi-circle. This was the boat cabin. The front was fitted with door panels, and there were even glass windows, which was very elaborate. Inside the cabin, there were six low bunks. Above the bunks, there were wooden shelves, one after another, where all the necessary utensils for the boat were placed: bamboo poles, oars, bamboo hats, raincoats, etc. In one corner of the stern of the boat, there were two most important things: firewood stoves. The tinplate around them on the boat panels was scrubbed as white as new. Further past, there were rows of bamboo tubes hanging, filled with oil, salt, soy sauce, and other things, hung high up, truly not taking up any space. Everything on the boat could be said to be clean and simple, arranged in an orderly manner, with every inch of space utilized according to the so-called principle of economy.</p>
<p>On the stern of the boat stood an old man with white hair, not very tall, with a complexion that was coarse yellow and dark. Fine wrinkles like spider webs were densely spread on his forehead. His clothes were very clean and simple, and his cheeks were full of short, coarse whiskers. He had a pipe in his mouth and one hand on the rudder, looking very comfortable. It was said to be the boat boss's father.</p>
<p>A woman was holding a rice basket, bending over, with almost half of her body outside the boat, her rough hands washing rice. Because the boat panels were very high, it was necessary to do this. She wore a large bun, dressed in dark blue calico, and her body seemed very sturdy, but her feet were bound small. This showed that it was not easy to change this deeply rooted custom in the inland.</p>
<p>On the bow of the boat, a mast that went straight into the clouds seemed to be leaning on the boat shed. The boat boss stood at the bow and poled, and four boatmen were lined up on both sides, each using their strength to pole. The bow of the boat was very pointed and high, very much like a dragon boat. This could reduce the resistance of the water.</p>
<p>Ming'er looked at everything so carefully because he was really too bored. After being tired of looking in the cabin, he walked out of the cabin, stretched his head, and looked at the surrounding scenery. After looking at it for too long and finding it too boring, he walked back in, either lying down or asking his mother for something to eat. Ming'er felt that he had more freedom than on the small boat to Hangzhou, but he didn't know how many days it would take to get to Tunxi. The boat was moving so slowly, and it was unbearably stuffy.</p>
<h3>Trachoma</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, Ying'er had been feeling like there was something rubbing in his eyes when he reviewed his lessons at night, and he couldn't open his eyes in the light and would tear up. However, Ying'er didn't tell his mother about this, thinking it was because his eyes were tired from reading too much. Later, the rubbing in his eyes became more and more severe day by day, and it became more and more uncomfortable day by day.</p>
<p>Ying'er became afraid and said to his mother:</p>
<p>"Mom, lately, it feels like there's something rubbing in my eyes, and I tear up often. What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me earlier?" his mother complained. "This must be trachoma. I'll take you to an ophthalmologist tomorrow."</p>
<p>"What's trachoma? I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Trachoma is a contagious disease. If you get infected, small, granular things will grow on the inner eyelid, like grains of sand. If you don't treat it, it will get worse year by year, and you might go blind. In the future, you must never use their towels to wipe your eyes in public places such as barber shops, theaters, and restaurants, because these towels are carriers of trachoma."</p>
<p>The next day, Ying'er's mother took him to an ophthalmologist, and the doctor treated him carefully. After a month, Ying'er's trachoma was cured, and he no longer felt rubbing or tearing up.</p>
<h3>Snow White (11)</h3>
<p>— Tian Sun</p>
<p>But Snow White, with both persuasion and deceit, took them outside to the water trough in the yard and began to bathe them. When she returned to the house, she saw them splashing water all over themselves, wiping and rubbing, very happy. Only Old Stubborn still refused to wash.</p>
<p>He still stood by and mocked his companions: "Hehe, you are a good bunch of beautiful little lotus flowers! You just wait. She will even get a red ribbon and tie up your beards, and even sprinkle some perfume behind your ears! I want to see who has the ability to make me take a bath. Only then will I admire him!"</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, the other dwarfs immediately rushed over, lifted Old Stubborn to the water trough, and prepared to push him into the water.</p>
<p>Just then, they suddenly heard Snow White shout, "Dinner is ready!"</p>
<p>They threw Old Stubborn out of the water, as if throwing down a hot sweet potato. The six dwarfs happily returned to the house for dinner.</p>
<p>In that palace, however, evil things were going on. The queen, having learned from the magic mirror that the huntsman had disobeyed her order and had not killed Snow White, but had secretly let her go, was furious. She swore to Heaven that if she did not kill Snow White in one day, she would not sleep or eat for one day. This determination could not be shaken by anyone. So she hurriedly prepared everything, intending to go to the seven dwarfs' house herself tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The queen first grabbed a tattered book, and spiders were crawling out of the dust-covered, yellowed pages. She seemed not to see them, but just eagerly flipped through the book page by page. Finally, she turned to the page about disguise, which she found satisfactory, and decided to follow it.</p>
<p>Then she said to herself, "This is exactly what I was thinking, to disguise myself as an old peddler woman! That little Snow White will definitely fall for it and will never drive away a poor old peddler woman. I have to sell her some good things, all very beautiful things! Hmph, yes, I also have to sell her 'death'!"</p>
<p>At this time, the queen was truly like a madwoman, running back and forth between those curved-necked distillers and glass bottles, looking here and looking there. Finally, she picked up a pale blue cup carved in the shape of a skull, poured several strange liquids into it, and stirred them together.</p>
<p>After stirring it well, she brought the cup to her mouth and drank the entire cup of liquid in one gulp. Strangely enough, after a short while, the queen transformed into an old woman with a terrible appearance. Her hands and claws were like animal claws, and her laughter sounded like a ghost's cry, very frightening. Her beloved crow perched on a skull, watching her frantically prepare everything, preparing to end Snow White's life. The queen let out a sinister and terrible voice, saying very triumphantly to herself, "Hehe, this time it couldn't be done more cleverly. One bite of a poisoned apple is all it takes to fall asleep as if soundly sleeping, and never wake up again. Those dwarfs will have to bury that little Snow White alive! As for the antidote, it's not that there isn't one. It must be the first kiss of a lover to wake her up, but where does she have any lover? Who will go and wake her up? Hehe, hehe, hehe!"</p>
