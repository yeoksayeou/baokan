<h3 id="c20">世界危機之展望 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>歐洲最近之形態與趨勢，可謂已臻不得不戰爭之境界；戰非意外之變故，不戰纔是意外之徼倖。導火綫已燃，爆發即在俄頃；謂猶得遏止者.有待非常之手腕，始有萬一之希望，顧非常手腕非可必得也。如此諭斷，言者已多；而二旬前美國駐英法德義四國大使之歸國述職，尤鑿鑿言之；最近二旬，趨勢益著。彼西班牙國民軍之陷琶塞隆納，共和政府軍有不復能繼續作戰之觀；如是之急轉直下者，可視為導火錢既燃至最後一霎那。自此日此時，此情此景，以迄於戰爭之爆發，祗須國民軍乘勢更進，一如義國羣衆所鼓動之「直衝法國」，則戰爭即至。自此日此時，此情此景，以迄於戰禍之消弭，有待國民軍中之義國士兵，勒馬懸崖，一如義國首相所保證之「退出西境」.則和平可保。二者異趨，皆在墨索里尼氏方寸間；按其本質，原非謂撒兵愈難於進攻，然近頃義國朝野所宣洩者，固無不以法國為矢的也。義國非不謂義國願望，以事實與正義為本，而興西班牙內戰無關；然謂義國將求貫澈其願望於撤退西班牙志願兵之後，誰則信之？義兵不撤，於是東北德意志，東南義大利，西南西班牙。環法蘭西者，三面皆敵也，不但與安南隔紹，且與非洲屬地隔絕；况安南海外，亦既有日本海軍空軍，以準備在中國北海登陸之姿態，與歐洲全能國家相呼應而窺伺安南矣。義大利之佈局若此，願望如彼，謂將姑捨之於今茲，而另圖之於異日歟？謂法蘭西將以領土拱手讓人，藉償義國之願望歟？</p>
<p>法義兩國之形態與趨勢若是，他國如何？察德義之所圖謀，以各個擊破為策略之中心；而以法國為首先擊破之對象。是不但德義所造就之輿情顯為之證，其外交活動亦灼然可覩也。就外交言之；對英，則努力離間英法關係；對蘇，則以蘇法互助協定所防者為德國而非義國，故德國對法有十二月六日之共同宣言，對蘇有商務官員之故相委蛇，以抵消蘇法協定之嚴重性，而以對法壓迫之勞怨，獨交之義大利；對中歐各國，則於制服捷克之後，於波蘭，匈加利，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞，懷柔示惠，無所不用其極；此其意義，要在分化蘇法兩國之衛星，以隔離蘇德之摩擦，而陷法國於孤立，一朝有事於地中海，德義得無後顧之憂。夫若是而竟盡如德義之圖謀，則義大利始以為剝法之皮，食法之肉，一舉手之勞而已，或兵不血刃可也。</p>
<p>雖然法國非捷克此也。法國陸軍負盛名，海軍視義國允勝，其歷史，其文化，其民族，自有維繫其國家之榮譽之道。屈膝外侮，坐待宰割，是見之捷克矣，而非所語於法國。况縱橫捭闔之為外交，以休戚利害為之基礎；殷鑒不遠，捷克以不獲外援於法捷協定，卒至瓜分豆剖，斯中歐諸國於德義之脅誘，安得不降志相從，然謂德義對中歐諸國之懷柔示惠，鑄成後方之銅墻鐵壁者，是迷信外交而忽視休戚利害之說也；一朝戰爭，友敵分野，有待重行釐整矣。故在各個擊破之策略之下：雖以法國不戰而屈為極則，然法國必應戰；雖以爭端不出法義二國範圍為願望，然中歐未可知也。至於英美蘇諸强之態度，夙為侵略國家所覷破而藐視，蓋一願獨善其身，二願有福共享；七八年來，一切國際重大變態，無不淵源於此。及至近頃，侵略國家咄咄逼人，使諸强不得不是認侵略者之面目為猙獰，不得不是認侵略者之野心為無饜，於是相率示人以漸知振作；法義而相見以兵，諸强殆將不復旁觀矣。於是言之，法義交鋒之日，即為世界第二决大戰之始，今其前夕也。萬一之望，惟有諸强慨然挺身而出，毅然表示民治諸國家，有難同當；或更進一步，針對彼侵略集團而各個擊破之，和平庶有可望歟。</p>

<p>— 任重</p>
<p>廣州三十萬的工人業經組織，在抗戰中英勇地担負着戰鬥的仟務。廣州失陷之後，三十個先鋒戰士，開進了山地，準備發動廣泛的游擊戰爭。</p>
<p>抗戰發動後一個月，廣州榨油，印刷，機器，電氣，建築工人，以及車夫苦力，就有人開始注意它的組織。一個靑年的工友—陳麗洲—，最先感覺到組織工作的必要，在他半生困苦的生活中，已經感覺到工人必須團結，尤其在暴敏瘋在的進攻下。同樣的，每一個廣州的工人，也眼看到敵人殘暴的攻擊不久就會加到自己身上，於是他們自覺的起來組織，克服了許多困難，才成立了一個勞工訓練班。</p>
<p>年青的工人們整批的跑來受訓，一個月一期的加緊訓練了四月，勞訓班的同志已有了三千多人，他們的力量相當偉大！三千多新的戰士在全廣州以至整個廣東的工人中，起了極大的推動作用！救亡的熱情，洋溢於每個工塲與作坊里，救亡的工作由工人影響到農人，商人，以至其他　衆。</p>
<p>勞訓班是全廣州三十萬工友們所擁護的團體，是最能接近羣衆工人的，因為他們平時有友誼的關係和同一的切身利害，所以聯絡與團結，要比任何職業團體來得緊密。</p>
<p>「班友會」是他們發動大衆參加抗日運動的一個主要的動力，三個月來，已有近十萬。成羣的農人，工人，小販，船夫……都來加人，在「班」的經費缺乏，無力推動工作的困難條件下，工友們自己拿出血汗錢來購買書報紙張，從整天勞苦不息的工作中，抽出時間來歌詠，演劇，經常出版街頭壁報，集合許多朋友看書讀報，討論時事。</p>
<p>一、游擊隊的母親－－趙老太太到達廣州，消息就傳進了「勞訓班」，於是便有「勞工歡迎隊」，在一個大雨滂沱之中到車站去迎接。「中國萬歲！」「游擊隊的母親萬歲！」「中華民族解放萬歲！」的呼聲，喊成一片。破舊的工衣濕透過破舊的襯衣，亂髮裹流過的雨水經過髒的皮膚，而發出臭味，隊伍中高高舉起一面錦旂，在熱烈的歡呼中，送到趙老太太的手裏。</p>
<p>雙十節，全國的獻金運動在風湧的推動，平時一無　聚的廣州工人們，也向被袋里搜案看僅有的銅子，每一個參加壁報，歌詠，運輸，担架的同志們，分別的奔跑到農村田莊，去找他們熟悉的朋友参加戲金，結果共集得二一千八百六十元」！這是幾千萬工友一毛一分金錢的積聚，這個數字表顯了工友們熱愛祖國的忠誠。</p>
<p>十一月十七日三萬靑年壯丁工人學生還在廣州舉行歌詠大遊行，二十一日廣州市民在無準備中倉惶退出，成羣的勞工救亡工友們，搗毀了重要的工廠作坊之後，也大部離開了市區，因為不願做亡國奴的勞工同志們，都是不為敵所使用的。</p>
<p>「勞工幹部」武裝起銅盔草鞋擎着來福槍和手溜彈，向廣花路上行進。漫天烽火把廣州毀滅將盡，三十多架敵機掠過市空投擲重磅炸彈，工人幹部勇敢地突園而出。到了嘉禾圩。人數少去一部，餘下的總計一百十三名。</p>
<p>「重新整飭我們的隊伍」！一百十三個排列起一條鐵的行列，經嘉禾圩西折官瑤蘆苞，沿江北夜行淸遠。三日三夜單衣餓肚，致病的同志十多個拖在隊的末尾，齊向一個村子裹去休息，那便是「沙河圩」，一百多戶的小市鎭。老百姓以為是擾人的軍隊，都跑了，村子上一點東西不能買到。工友們還是全部駐留下來，開始做民運工作。首先，接近許多逃走的老百姓，幫助他們維持治安，割木，打禾，担榖，挑水，經過三天之後，市上的人民增多了，物價也即刻低落下來。</p>
<p>他們發現了一個極大的武力：一百多戶人民的自衛槍枝有三百多枝！壯丁們携槍要求打游擊，羣衆情緒的高漲已到了頂點，這是同志們由宜傳而組織的極好機會。鄉村角落裹有人在個別談話，村民們經過一番宣傳之後，對於抗日游擊戰爭有了淸楚的認識，更多的村民要求加入「勞幹」的組織。</p>
<p>同志們一天祇得到一頓白飯，在經濟微薄的情况，他們不能把村民都帶走，不過，他們仍能保持兩下的聯絡，大部份工友到曲江，担任兵站總監的運輸工作，一小部份仍繼續做組織工作。工人幹部是他們整個工人羣衆的中心，他們决定在曲江補充一點幹部，同時就選出三十個文化政治水準較高，堅决勇敢能够獨立作戰的工作幹部，前往粵北一帶，發動羣衆，準備將來的游擊戰爭。這三十個幹部是鋼鐵軍的先鋒隊，「忠勇團結，堅苦　鬥，」是他們此去粵北共守的隊訓。</p>
<p>鐵的意志，鐵的紀律，鐵的洪流，我們是鋼鐵軍，我們開上前線，我們的使命楚求民族解放，爭取世界的和平。那種高吭的粗聲，吼出他們自己寫的歌曲，在一個熱烈的空氣中，三十個民族戰士踏上了征途。</p>

<p>論割除生殖腺之利弊</p>
<p>我們不能否認，現在科學的進步，確已把握了人類種族改進的機杻。允其黷武主義的國家，他們對於種族的優生問題，研究允爲積極，不惜大刀闊斧，用急進手段，對於不能生育患有性病之國民，施以宮刑，這樣以來，所有小國民，儘是壯健魁梧之士。將來衝鋒陷陣，不是可以指揮如意了嗎？</p>
<p>倡此政策者，爲德國的希特勒，據說頗有成績，凡欲結婚的國民，必先到國家指定的醫生處，施行嚴格檢查，如若發現患有花柳傳染病，及生殖機能不克產生壯健的子嗣。則施用手術，割除其生殖腺。</p>
<p>德國政府爲了要使此種政策推行時减少弊端起見，特制定了一種急進的法律呌做「遺傳病廢止法。」已實行五年了。依照此法律德國全境設立了數百個特種法庭，其使命爲判定割除生殖腺的處分。不料此種跡近奇特法律，時至今日，竟被日本所傚允，日議員亦倡割除生殖腺的建議，但旋給厚生省束置高閣，遲遲而不實行，厚生省採取此種觀望主義，爲了實行後，自有許多流弊，若操之過急，難免受民衆責難，蓋事關重大，若組織不善，不僅不能澈底推行，反使生殖率大爲减低。</p>
<p>根據各國專家的意見，這種法律應有擇其緩急輕重的必要，蓋患劇烈性的花柳病者，確宜割去其生殖腺，若僅健康水準低下，因生殖機能的衰弱，則可採用動物靑春腺（即生殖腺）素，以補入人體，可充分治愈。（編者按，德國今已採取此法，故割去生殖腺，僅施以嚴重的花柳病息者。）</p>
<p>蓋精力渙散，性機能衰弱的原因，完全由於縱慾及自凟所致，靑春腺遂失却其繁榮，遺精早洩，陰萎不妊等症相繼爆發。蓋此時若能回復靑春腺的繁榮，上述各症，自會消失，何待用此割除生殖腺的消極下策也。</p>
<p>德國醫學素稱發達，人材輩出，故著名生理學家梅倫博士，遂向猩猩提出共睪丸精質，發明眞正靑春腺素男用女用「補體康」，凡患生殖不能，性欲减退等病，從此同春有術，不復再上手術台矣。此不僅德國公民之幸，實爲全人類的福音。</p>

<p>藥足治病，然藥不對症，反足殺人，此猶水能浮舟，亦能覆舟，端在用之得當與吾爲斷，今余以淋病治療爲例，允可信然。自科學發展，一日千里，對於淋病療治，巳非囊時僅一般庸劣之醫家，作坐井觀天之推測。謂如何療法，是無效，如何療法爲無效。例如化學療法對於淋病治療的關係上，其事亦非起於今日，而不知者，遂以爲此乃治淋最新療法，此亦非是。該療法起原甚早，而因無眞實學養之醫家，（病家更不必說），遂目爲對治療上之異軍突起。蓋化學療法，對淋病上固有重大貢獻，但非一般醫家信口開河，據爲自己發明之美名耳。因發明一種淋病特效藥，决非一般終日忙碌診務之醫家所得問津，一種特效藥之發明，必須是眞正學者，終日孜孜不倦，在實騐室中下苦工夫，始或有獲，此事觀夫德國彼德博士而益可證明。彼德博士，是現代淋學大師，其所發明之「克淋儂」，歷盡千辛萬苦，具百折不回之心，有屢蹶屢起之勇，當其採用「克淋儂」的蛋白體與黃色素二種貴重成分時，費盡無限心血，逐步改良，淘汰不良之雜質，更以科學方法操作而成，復經過無數决之動物試騐，及各大醫院專科醫師，採爲臨床的實騐，始抵於成功。所費時間已逾三十餘年矣，試問發明一種特效藥，是何等困難之事，决不是人人可以尸發明之名的。</p>
<p>故凡是一切新舊白濁。經過其他化學療法，或局部手術所不愈，與夫一般誇稱三五天可愈之成藥，皆不能根治者，服「克淋儂」皆可治愈之，久已被國際醫家所證明，舉凡攝護腺炎，畢丸炎，膀胱炎，前後尿道炎等，非服「克淋儂」决難收效也。總之要解决本人切身痛苦之白濁，先要抉據特效藥，吾則，一輩子總難將拖泥帶水之淋病完全肅淸，淋病息者宜切實記牢。</p>

<p>一暴十寒終身難於</p>
<p>淋病在急性時期，治療得當，原也沒有什麼難事，（此指合法的對症治療而言）可是患者興醫家，對於急性淋，往往於慌亂之中，失去治愈之機會，因爲在急性淋時，病家十九不能忍耐他那樣入骨的痛苦，不免要求醫家作鎮痛之治法，以求苟安之局，而醫家也爲了迎合病家之心理起見，不惜迷亂對於治淋固有之步驟，及至淋病之痛苦漸减，病家以爲此是日就向愈之好現象，其實此是由急化慢之症狀，治療上較之急性爲難，醫家雖亦知之，而心中不便說出，徒拖延其時日而已。患者因被此等不良之醫治，往往嗒然似喪者，往後，遂失去其根治之决心，每作一暴十寒，終身難愈之害。</p>
<p>幸勿沉迷回頭是岸</p>
<p>以余所見，此種淋病患者，應當加强淋病必可根治之信念，同時又當快選確可負責之醫家，或特效藥，則淋病雖已屆如何絕望之境，不難挽回旣倒之在瀾也。在電療方面則德國靜電療法，及X線電療，均可交相爲用，其殺菌力有恰到好處之勝，更輔之以淋病聖藥「克淋儂」俾其服後細胞發生一種抗淋噬菌作用，如此則雖任何頑固難愈之淋病，亦不難尅日就痊矣，余臨床已近二十年，自採用此療法後，治淋成績爲之頓高，非無故也。診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起，每天送診甘號每號僅收號金五角</p>

<p>在新新旅館被人槍繫　腦部受重創不治斃命</p>
<p>馬近受「維新政府」僞命爲參議</p>
<p>公共租界貴州路新新旅館內、於昨日下午七時許、發生暗殺案一起、兇手在逃未獲、內慕含有政治性質、茲將各惰紀述於下、</p>
<p>從香港來</p>
<p>在本月二十六日左右、貴州路新新旅館內來一年近花甲之男旅客、察其舉止談吐、頗似富貴中人、當時該旅館招待卽爲導至六樓第六百零五號大房間、供其寄寓、並由其在旅客循環簿上、書明蔡君、粵籍、年四十一歲等字樣、訊其來自何處、則以香港對、並稱來滬純係探訪親友、</p>
<p>賓客盈至</p>
<p>連日來其本人極少外出、但每日往訪者、則頗不乏人、大都皆屬上等賓客、因此房中座客常滿、主人應接甚繁、而侍役等亦趨奉殷勤、招呼週到、昨日傍晚七時三十分左右、又有十餘賓客在該房中與主人閒談、當時主人身穿灰色嗶嘰棉襖、白條絨褲、拖鞋、坐在門右沙發椅上、手執當晚夜報、且閱且談、狀極自得、</p>
<p>忽聞槍聲</p>
<p>正在斯時、該房左近侍役堂口、忽聞槍聲一響、出自該房內、旋見先前在座許多賓客、紛紛奪門而出在奔逃命、而呼號之聲亦隨之而起、該侍役等乃急往探視、則見房中闐無一人、該蔡姓旅客已倒於地上、血漬殷然、尙在呼號不已、侍役等驚駭萬狀、遂往賬房報吿、卽轉報捕房、</p>
<p>氣息僅屬</p>
<p>該管老閘捕房近在咫尺、一得警報、立飭中西探捐馳往查勘、時本報記者亦經得訊趕往、則見房中桌椅東倒西歪、紛亂不堪、受傷者尙僵臥地上、血漬污滿四週、察其氣息、已屬細若遊絲、當時卽由探捕召到救護車、將其飛送仁濟醫院急救、一面卽在房中搜尋綫索、當拾獲彈壳一枚、並將房中所有足跡指痕等、逐一攝影、携回捕房存案、</p>
<p>不治斃命</p>
<p>傷者送達醫院後、卽由該院醫師爲之察勘傷處、則發覺子彈係從左太陽穴進射、由右耳下穿出、腦部完全受創、因此雖經多方施術、終於無濟、延至當晚九時四十五分氣絕身死、當時卽由醫院報吿捕房、又復派探前往查看、並在其身畔抄出名片一紙、及「維新政府」發給其本人之通行證一紙、於是眞姓名因而發覺焉、屍體將於今晨送往膠州路騐屍所待騐、</p>
<p>查出姓名</p>
<p>其名片上所刋姓名爲馬育航三字、而特別通行證上亦爲馬育航三字、係偽「維新政府立法院長」溫宗堯簽發、其職務欄內塡有僞「維新政府參議」字樣、當時記者憶馬氏曾任國民政府軍委會參議、現任國府資源委員會委員。華南米業公司不作此喪心病在之舉、許或另有其人也、但經以眞正馬育航照相核對、則確屬一人也、</p>
<p>死者略歷</p>
<p>查馬育航爲廣東惠州人、現年六十歲、爲遜淸秀才、旋入廣東法政學堂、與陳炯明爲同鄉、民國九年曾任汕頭籌餉局總辦、民十年任海南島民政處長、廣東財政廳長、經濟調查局長等職、自此案發生後、捕房方面偵查不遺餘力、至於被擊時情形、兇手自何而入、抑或卽雜在房內賓客中下手、目下尙難剖析、尙在嚴密審查中、</p>

<p>兩路要道</p>
<p>亦爲滬西日軍之根據地、惟該校建築鞏固、規模宏大、頗難進襲、金大隊長奉令後、即調集部下忠義健兒四百餘名、親自率領、於黑夜中行軍五十餘里、向該處進發、在出發前復由指導員周羗兩君先後致詞、當時各健兒咸高呼願死口號、聲震山岳、旁觀民衆、亦皆攘臂高呼、情之</p>
<p>悲壯熱烈</p>
<p>誠足使人淚下、進抵目的地時、日軍尙未知覺、待手溜彈與殺聲齊發、方倉惶應戰、斯時長官士兵爭先衝擊、日兵的百餘名、用大砲機槍亂轟、一時槍砲聲大作、密如連珠、激戰的半小時、日兵不支、向東逃上兵艦逸去、斯時全部隊伍衝入日軍司令部、用汽油分澆各處大厦、一時火熖騰空、日軍所存糧儲及軍用品</p>
<p>焚燬殆盡</p>
<p>此時浦江日艦之探照燈向四方照射、並開放大砲數響示威、游擊隊見任務已畢、仍向四方退去、此偉大之戰役、華方輕傷隊員三人、奪獲大砲一尊三八式步槍數支、日兵死六七人、軍用物品損失無算、此爲滬西民衆痛恨之日司令部、終於全燬矣、按此舉不惟表汞華方游擊隊之善戰與忠勇、更使人知日軍之脆弱、潰敗即在目前、</p>

<p>路透社東京二十四日電，據電文中略云：民政黨議員二人，詆責厚生省過於護慎迂緩，致不能在最近之將來，收滿意之成效，故擬在誶中提出割生殖腺議案，彼等認爲此案今爲迫切要圖。發起是案之某員稱：此一名詞，聞之固屬駭人，然男子經必要之手術後，能早日回復工作，女子則僅須休息兩三日……等語。按日本自發動中日戰事以來，其國內已民窮財盡，不可終日，此在稍具時代眼光者，幾爲盡人知之，但用割除生殖腺以爲挽救，亦適見其飮鴆止渴而已。</p>
<p>緣人類之有生殖腺，猶植物之有花蕾，動物之有睪丸與卵巢。我人欲享用其枝葉，使其枝葉特別茂盛，乃有摘去其花蕾，使其發育作用格外旺盛之一法。動物亦有去勢之法，使之肥育，因我人目前的乃在肉用也。如肉用雞，鴨，牛，羊之去勢是。此外在優生上亦有，如某特別種低劣或有病態，我人不欲其繁殖，乃去其勢，或摘其花蕾，以絕滅其繁殖作用，不使謬種傳流。惟此種方法，雖已用於植物及動物，但施用於人類，尙多　議。因人乃爲萬物之靈，除生命之外，尙有智，情，意等的高級作用，誰應繁榮種族？誰應剝奪幸福？這個標準殊難决定。何况今之日本，因經濟困窮，欲國民專力工作，用割除生殖腺以挽救，這未免太可　議的窮極無聊了。然我人不幸而生逢亂世，或說何幸而生在這大時代裏，爲環境的壓迫，或爲志願的奮勇，總之，我人的幸福固不必放棄，而工作效率必然要增加，然後才能應付目前的時艱而有所作爲。但我人的精力有限，何能達此目的？這在二十世紀的醫藥界上早已發明培補生殖腺的特效方法了。其發明的史實，在本篇因篇幅所限不能詳述，我們現在只能簡要的說，已能在雄壯動物與人類相近的如猿猴，猩猩，牛羊等體中提取其生殖腺素精製成劑，名爲斯丹那氏「生殖素」（藥分男女，各藥房均售），於服後確能於一日期夜間即能生精補賢，培補生殖機能使之健全，同時功效及血液，肌肉，腦部，神經以及各種內分泌腺內，使之增强機能。所以若繼續服用，則必能在短期內增强精力，却除疾病，使身體益臻健康，工作效率增加，頭腦淸明，春情活潑，收返老還童之效。男子如因早年自凟遺精，或婚後荒淫，多妻縱慾，或工作　傷，用腦過度，或先天衰弱，病後失調諸種原因，致生殖機能衰弱，暴發遺精滑精，早洩賢虧，性器短小如指，未老先衰，腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰痛背　，面黃肌瘦，精神萎靡，久婚不育諸種症象，則服此生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，尤爲最對症而特效，無不收藥到病除之功。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩則收效尤速，但患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，診用電療，注射，手術等其他最新療法，則尤可保證治愈。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>朱柏廬先生的治家格言裏。有兩句「宜未雨而綢繆。毋臨渴而掘井」的話來訓誡子孫，我認爲他這兩句話的涵義，對於人類的優生學上，與社會進化史上，都有着獨特的功勳。</p>
<p>我們現在不說別的，單把將來可以靠他噉飯的學術來講，假如一個學生，在中小學或大學的求學時代，因爲平日太不用功，祗知道有機會到什麼地方去玩玩。或則雖在上課，而兩隻眼睛根本不放在書本子上，及至考期到臨，自己想想，我的學業是萬難及格的，但不及格怎樣對得住父母的屬望呢？於是心中一急，連忙趕緊用功，但這種監渴掘井的用功，試問還來得及嗎？（至於羞愧之心已無而並不着急者，這種人更不屑一談）。</p>
<p>更有一種不知自愛的靑年，對生理的構造，旣無充分了解，對健康的寳貴，又不知道愛護，但逞一時的歡娛，或爲一時的衝動，不惜破壞健康，或則眠花宿柳，或則躭溺自凟，自凟與縱慾俱爲　傷靑春腺最厲害的舉動，於是精關松弛，便有遺精滑精。腦弱失眠，賢虧無能，發育不全，耳鳴心悸，及全身的神經衰弱等各種現象，這是一個軀體等於像一隻「碎盌」弄得處處都是毛病，然而他當此時期，還是不知怕懼，因循苟延，及至精枯血竭，幾將一病不起而方始着急求救，那雖幸而不死，然而已很吃力的了！</p>
<p>綜上所論，所以我認爲無論做什麼事情，事前應當有一種準備，而對於足以妨碍健康的疾病。尤應隨時加以預防，如不幸而已罹有遺精滑精時，更須速醫，至於醫治的方法，一方面須淸心寡慾，嚴守攝生，一方尤須以「布米脫氏固精神片』鞏固其精神關，則遺精可以當晚立止，不致再釀後患。其已因遺洩過頻而引起發育不全，賢虧陰萎，面色枯槁，形消骨立者，更宜同時服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補其精血，旺盛其靑春腺，促進新陳代謝機能，如能及時予以挽救，何致於有『臨渴掘井』之嘆？</p>
<h3 id="c63">女性健美要訣 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>語云：『緣木而求魚，其可得乎？』健美，雖爲每個女性所熱烈追求，但在脂粉中以求，此亦猶緣木而求魚，所以無怪世間女子醜的多，美的少！然則女子將怎樣以追求健美？這非在女性軀體的根本上着想不可，女性的健美，必須根據於女性特徵的發達。女性特徵的事發達，是必要根據於生理上卵巢機能的健全。如果卵巢機能健美，那乳峯即首先有良好的發育，呈高聳而有彈性的狀態。髖骨擴大，臀部亦呈發達現象，此在身段上即構成了女性最髖秘的曲線美。同時新陳代謝作用亦必相當旺盛，是以在皮膚，肌肉，血液，內分泌腺各部分中均充滿新生細胞，因此皮膚自然白嫩，肌肉自然豐腴，血液自然鮮紅，鮮紅的血色在白嫩的皮膚上透露出來，加以笑容可掬，體態嬝娜，這豈不是天仙一般的女郎？男子有了這種妻子，自然情切切而意綿綿，不會說「家花那有野花香」了。這種丈夫固然是多麼幸福，這種女郎也是多麼的光榮！所以眞正健美的女子，斷不在脂粉中講求。假使女性而患有月經不調，白帶不感等的暗疾，卵巢機能卽受其摧殘，新陳代謝作用亦因以减退，是以乳癟而顏衰，此種女子，雖塗滿了脂粉，亦適足於益顯其虛偽與醜陋。如果聰明的女郎，她們必要在根本上設法，就是服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」以培補卵巢機能使之健全，促進新陳代謝作用使之旺盛，則上述各症旣可根本痊愈，復可使乳峯聳起，面頰紅潤，增進天然可貴的健美。</p>

<p>眞眞僥倖！我到今日，才如撥雲而見靑天，方跳出這個遺精的陷阱，但是事後追想起來，我覺得名藥之功不可减，這裏有掬誠奉吿讀者的必要！</p>
<p>我今年二十歲，患遺精已足有五年，在初發生的第一年里，次數旣少，人也不覺得什麼疲勞，所以我根本不放在心上，及至第三年十八歲那年冬季，我由蘇州分店調至上海總店，工作旣繁，接觸的又盡是女性，於是症勢陡見增劇，簡直每隔一二日期必遺，有時一夜達二三次，此時雖已稍稍懼，然因限於經濟，終不獲毅然就醫，歲月蹉跎，倏忽經年，迨至去歲秋間，遺精竟變成滑精，日間亦會自動流出，此際身心之痛苦，肢體之疲乏，簡直非筆墨所能形容，自知長此以往，非徒職業要發生動搖，恐於將來之婚後幸福，益將無福消受，於是迫不及待，便向某大藥房購得遺精藥半打，以爲我是遺精，服遺精藥當然可以見效，豈知連服四盒，症勢依舊，半打服完，遺精倒沒有好，反弄得頭痛腦脹，精神不安起來，如此情形，我實不堪忍受，遂又向五洲購得『希米脫氏固精片』二盒『生殖素』二盒，依照貴刋之指導，在同一期間兼服，看它有沒有效驗？那知道一次的嘗試，竟出我意料之外，二盒服完，遺精已止，續服四盒，滑精亦愈，現在精强力足，神采飛逸，已一洗從前萎　狀態，欣慰之餘，爰記之以吿同病，</p>

<p>上海之戰事、雖已於前年停止、然社會狀態、尙未復原、租界內之「乙」「丙」「丁」三區防綫、仍有外國駐軍駐守、因此商團團員、僅於八月間一度代替英軍、在「乙」區內防守、其餘職務、不過協助捕房、或徇各防區司令之請、維持租界內部之治安、該團於上年之七七·八一三·九一八·及隻十節等紀念日、因時局緊張、奉命出動、協助捕房及外國駐軍、防止暴動、所採措置、頗有成效、</p>
<p>商團各隊、每月集合會操一次、並於靶子塲開放後不久、重行練習射靶、通至靶子塲之道路、因「甲」防區司令談判之結果、自三月三日起開放、准許商團團員通行、</p>
<p>在六月十三日與八月八日之間、租界捕房曾請商團派遣鐵甲車隊、在蘇州河以南巡邏、每週二次、時間自下午五時半起、至十一時止、</p>
<p>商團之巡邏、有鐵甲車巡邏與武裝軍用車巡邏兩種、捕房方面及「丙」防區司令、常請商團派鐵甲車、在轄境內巡邏、以資協助、武裝軍用車上之商團團員、在維持治安時、招待職務較便、故此種車輛、常隨同鐵甲車出發、以便彈壓暴動、成績頗爲良好、鐵甲車內裝置無綫電話以後、效用更見進步、捕房方面播送之消息、可以迅速傳至裝有此種電話之鐵甲車、因此各團員遇有需要時、立可奔往出事地點、</p>

<p>（八一三前後工資之變動）根據上列兩表、把戰前戰後的各業工資情形比較一下、戰後的工資、很明顯地比戰前低落了、這種低落情形、在實際收入的數字中、更是顯著、內衣·搪瓷·織襪·三業·戰後工資、减退最甚、一方面是由於交通阻隔、內地銷路銳减、一方面因戰後各該業規模較大廠家、什九停開、所存較小工廠、工資原屬較低、有幾個工業、戰後工資、反較增高、如棉紡業的每小時工資率、二十五年爲三分九厘、每月實際收入二十五年十元○五分、二十七年十三元三角、增高的原因、由於上海人口激增、棉織品需要孔殷、紗業亦即勃興、增雇熟手工人、因而提高工資、同時棉紡市塲的操縱抬價、造成紗價高漲、由無影響、絲織棉織兩業、工資亦形增加、增加的原因、實由於戰前數月中、正絲棉織業蓬勃興旺之時、紛紛要求加給工資、戰事一起、雖受打擊、工資已增、二十七年度稍形减退、惟以人口增加、服御用途大廣、故工資仍高於二十五年度、戰事發生、繅絲業所受影響甚烈、大半淪入戰區、存者亦時作時輟、惟入後因外銷漸旺、產量减少、絲價大昂、營業漸形活躍、工資亦復舊觀、近更以熟手工人缺乏、廠方爭以厚資誘引、工資益趨高漲、麵粉業工資、向以月計、故戰前後並無重大變動、他如榨油造紙兩業、戰後開工者、榨油權大有餘、大德新兩家、造紙僅竟成一家、調査範圍、旣不普遍、自難與戰前數字相較、雖有損益、殊未足據爲定論、</p>
<p>（每日工作時間）　在下列表中、各個工業、均依照平均每日實際工作時數排列、工作時間最長的、要推棉紡·麵粉·棉織·榨油·造紙·等業、每天在十一小時至十二小時之間、烟草火柴工作時間較短、在六小時半至八小時半之間、値得注意的是棉紡·麵粉·棉織·繅絲·等業、工資率最低、工作時間亦最長、冗工薄給、這幾業工人的境况、可以想見、工作時間的長短、是跟着商業盛衰而變遷的、在二十年至二十四年間、工商凋敝的時候、各個工業、都感受極度困難。因此相率减少工作、限制出口、這種情形、對於工作時間的影響甚著、而尤以件工爲甚、件工是依出件多寡給予工資的、在工業衰頺的環境下、件工首先受到、减少工作的機會、所以件工的工作時間之變動、比時工劇烈、在雇用多數件工的各業中、其平均工作時間、也往往較雇用時工的工業爲短、</p>
<p>（每月工作日數）　各工業中每月平均工作日數、以麵粉業每月工作二十九天、榨油業每月二十八天爲最多、一月之中、簡直沒有休息的時候、繅絲·織襪·機器·烟草·印刷等業、工作日數較少、每月在十八天至二十六天之間、在有幾業中、特別在火柴·烟草·繅絲·等、各月工作日數、頗不一致、陰晴的變化、原料的間缺、都是造成工作時輟時續的主因、工作旣無一定、收入亦即動搖、工人的生活、便不能有固定的保障了、據理、每日產量、非不能加以調整、這是工廠管理的問題、工作倘有間輟的情形、工廠當局、實不能辭其咎、民國二十七年度工作日數、較上一年頗有增加、足以表示上海的市面、戰後有畸形發展的現象、繅絲一業、在該業工人的二十六年度實際收入、是空前的低數、</p>
<p>（眞實工資之趨向）　眞實工資指數、可以顯示工人生活的實况、收入增高、生活費降低、則生活優裕、反之則生活艱難、故工人生活的優劣、要視兩者升降的程度而定、二十六年、實際收入指數急遽下降、而生活費劇漲、兩者背道而馳、眞實工資、遂自一○三·九六、降至八一·二七、二十七年實際收入、雖稍增加、情形却不見佳、生活費指數、突自一○六·二七、增至一三七·五一、眞實工資、續降至六二·八一、從上面眞實工資指數的升降中、可以看到戰時工人生活艱辛情狀的一斑了　（完）</p>

<p>— 黃雨</p>
<p>三，外挖裏扣之計算</p>
<p>至於專營匯劃貼現新機關之現鈔來源，一小部份爲向客商以匯劃票據零星買進，一大部份則向同行或銀行收買，其一般計算方法，卽爲外挖與裏扣，試舉數例說明之：</p>
<p>例一　甲商向同行乙商買進現鈔一萬元，設當日行市爲四十五元，則由甲出一票面一萬零四百五十元之匯劃票據交乙，而此所加之四百五十元，則係匯劃，其計算式如下：</p>
<p>例二　設客戶丙以票面一萬元之匯劃票據，向甲貼現，則依當日行市，甲付乙現鈔九千五百五十元，而此所扣之四百五十元，則係現鈔，其計算式如下：</p>
<p>例三　設客戶丁以現鈔向甲購買匯劃一萬元，依當日行市，應付現鈔九千五百七十元零二角五分，其計算式如下：</p>
<p>匯劃貼現之計算，槪不外上述三種方式，讀者倘對上列三式細加核算，當可知於同一行市之下，一度買進賣出間，相互之折合關係矣，更有進者，貼水行市，初無一定之準則，經營者之故事提高或抑低，藉資增加利潤，自屬不可避免之事實，本埠銀行聯合準備委員會，爲調劑市面起見，曾出而維持，限定貼水大小；而上述弊　，仍在所不免，大槪規模較大，歷史較久，而以貼現爲兼營業務之銀號或錢兌荘，其行市較爲正確，所取利潤亦較微；其他則匪所願言矣。惟以每日行市，變化莫測，且票據之是否可靠，更少相當保障，然則經營此業，亦非易事，各行荘之貼水，較規定貼現率必需略事提高者，殆亦以此。</p>
<p>四，匯劃貼現前途之瞻望</p>
<p>邇來社會一部分人士，頗有主張取銷匯劃票據者，以爲此項不兌現票據，對工商各界，實有弊而無利。殊不知匯劃票據，乃戰後之時代產物，與限制提存制度，有連帶關係，如根本予以取銷，則與財部安定金融辦法相抵觸，各銀行方面之大部存款頭寸，將停滯無用，而市上卽有籌碼不足之虞，退一步言，如將此種匯劃票據，一律改爲劃頭，則又與政府安定金融之根本相矛盾，故就戰時金融立塲言，此項票據，實有繼續聽其流動於市塲之必要，其理由凡三：</p>
<p>一，防止一部份資金變爲外匯，减少外匯市塲之波動，此與統制外匯之實施上有密切之連　。</p>
<p>二，减少法幣需要數量，避免以多量現鈔，流入奸人或敵方之手，作擾亂中國戰時金融之工具。</p>
<p>三，穩定銀錢業之基礎，使各商業銀行，得以調整戰時之存放事業，而提存之風險，可以避免。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，一年來匯劃票據，旣由事實證明，可以爲交易之籌碼，則往來匯劃，僅爲銀錢業同行間之手續，而存戶本身，並無不便之處，所損失者，僅爲畸形發展狀况下之上海產生一種貼現制度耳，設各界不需現鈔，則仍無損失可言，縱或以此種匯劃票據支付，在某種交易方面，價格容有折扣，然僅屬至少之數，於整個金融，無大影響，在另一方面，得藉此養成吾人使用票據之習慣，以票據有相當之認識，臻我國工商業於另一新階段，則塞翁失馬，未始非該制之意外收獲也，竊以爲本埠銀錢業如出而協議取銷貼現制度，或對於貼現率作嚴格之限制，則於安定金融市塲，當尤有裨益，總之，此項辦法，旣爲應戰時環境而設，則將來戰事結束，自可無形取銷；同時今日之不得兌現者，自亦係暫時狀態，吾人正不必斤斤引以爲憂，作庸人之自擾也。（完）</p>

<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>新吉訶德先生的以出身，不是貴族的爵士，而是破落中胡暴發戶；他并沒有真得要做騎士的心只是擺著像煞騎士的架子；他雖决不熱中於古俠，但是為迷惑於利慾，因而弄胡眼睛花亂，七顛八倒，顯出了一副比吉訶德先生先生更加可笑同時又非常可憎的尷尬騎士相。</p>
<p>他生的不長，其實很矮；所騎的不是瘦馬，而是餓狗；所拿的不是長矛，而是短聲。他想避免破落爾維持暴發戶，可又想不出堂堂正正的良策，沒法，只好偷偷摸摸地去掘人家的壁脚，盜竊財務回來，而後高踞寶座，牽著狗鼻，揮著鏧子威風凜凜地宣揚他這騎士出征魔鬼的勝利！</p>
<p>他的所謂魔鬼，不是錯看了的風車，而是一切他的盜竊物內所有主。</p>
<p>每决他總是在更深夜半，爲人不備的時候進行盜竊。但是，一而再，再而三，盜竊案發，人家自然要經心防備起來。於是，當他再去鑽壁脚時，就起了格門。破落的暗影，在他腦際映過，也竟鼓勵起了他的騎士氣概”硬着頭皮，舉起了鏧子逢人便打，牽住了餓狗，往人家內室亂竄，一邊翻箱倒篋，一邊高聲吆喊：「我是在替你們斬除魔鬼，驅逐盜賊，帮你們謀全家福利的呀！」而那在他袴下的餓狗，也「嘮嘮嘮」地着他不住狂吠。</p>
<p>他還以爲人家睡夢未醒，雖已站起身來，或許仍是昏昏懂懂；用小鑿子可以嚇得下，用幾句話可以騙得過。這樣他掠奪着了「勝利品」後，便能神氣十足地對外宣揚說：「我已除盡了魔鬼！」那是多麼漂亮的騎士風度？</p>
<p>不幸這只任利慾不看實情的如意算盤，打得七錯八搭。人家在這時，不但完全清醒，而且早有準備。這在破落中的暴發戶，雖像也有一股風的蠻勁，到底經不起人家長久的團攻。看看是已經聲嘶力竭，快要倒下去了，實再無法，只得再掙扎一下，對旁觀的人挺起舌頭，吐出幾句像然騎士的話來：「你們看，魔鬼在作怪了!你們快跟我合作提携，一同去殺魔鬼，以求永遠的安定…和平…」</p>
<p>可是，誰聽他的鬼話，肯讓他不斷地來打家刦舍呢？有的一掌打倒了這小醜，有的一脚踢翻了那餓狗。他，這位新吉訶德先生，只好摸着鼻子瞪着眼發呆。</p>

<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>後半夜格外冷，孟元仲元兄弟倆穿了農人的衣裳，冒着風，按着一張模糊的地圖，帶着那封信，要在天亮以前趕到指定的那地方。</p>
<p>天太冷，月亮星點不敢出來，只有黑黑的一團雲。路上也一點光都沒有，只有孟元仲元手裏的手電筒。他們每人帶着凍殭了的兩條脚，邁着又大又快的步子。偶爾嘴裹吹出幾聲歌調，可都被冷風刮倒了，結果還是一片寂靜。</p>
<p>他倆的心，跳動得比步子更快；熱，熱得幾乎沸騰。全身的血，也都汹湧着。他們的精神是够好的，這末挺起胸膛，很勇敢地向前行進。</p>
<p>走了一程，忽然，一聲暴跺驚奇的呼聲：</p>
<p>『喂！什麼人？』</p>
<p>孟元把電筒往旁邊照過去，仲元的電筒也亮了：一個穿草綠色軍服的人，矮矮的，學着來復槍，正是敵軍的哨兵。</p>
<p>『你們是什麼人？』來復槍的刺力在孟元仲元兩個人頭顱間幌着。</p>
<p>兩個人的電筒都滅了，仲元手裏的地圖也掉了。矮哨兵却掏出電筒來照着。他們走錯了路了。</p>
<p>地圖被矮哨兵拾了起來：「八個牙路！」</p>
<p>在來復槍的威脅下，他們被他帶了走。孟元我了一個機會引開了矮哨兵的注意，把那封信，那封機密的信，塞進嘴裏，嚼幾下，呑下去了。矮哨兵冷得正在抖，又在準備着扳槍鈕，根本沒注意到。</p>
<p>繞過一個小坡，順山路下去，就是敵兵的支營。</p>
<p>八九個留着小鬍子的兵，圍着一堆火打着寒噤。</p>
<p>矮哨兵帶了孟元仲元過去，他們都站了起來，好像很高興，又好像很害怕，趕緊提起槍桿。</p>
<p>『這兩個人在山路上偷偷摸摸，還帶着電筒，地圖……』</p>
<p>『你們幹什麼的？』一個哭喪臉的軍官，在一分鐘之後爆出這句話。</p>
<p>『我們種田的。』孟元低微的聲音。</p>
<p>『那末電筒那裏來的？』</p>
<p>『搶來的。』仲元宏亮的聲音。</p>
<p>『地圖呢？你們怎末會有地圖？』</p>
<p>「拾來的。』還是仲元。</p>
<p>『嘿，假話！們是奸細！還瞞得過我嗎？」矮哨兵捉住了孟元和仲元，當然要炫耀自己的功績，說完了還拉長了嘴笑一笑，像是示威，又像是自己得意。</p>
<p>他們已經在孟元仲元身上搜過，不但搜過，還用來復槍的柄重重的敲過幾下。</p>
<p>「你們把要帶的信息或者什麼要通知的戰策說出來，就可以不死！」軍官說。</p>
<p>他們沈默着。矮哨兵却又開口了：</p>
<p>不必好好的問，還是先給一點顏色他們看看！』</p>
<p>軍官居然接受了一個哨兵的建議。於是，一把斧頭拏來了。一個個子最高的人拏着斧頭，呌孟元仲元伸出手來，把手指按在桌上。他用斧頭的背面重重的槌下去。一下，兩下……眼淚從孟元仲元的眼眶裹掉出來，一滴，兩滴——落在身上，像一滴火油，落在火熖裏，激起了厲害的憤怒。</p>
<p>一分鐘，兩分鐘，他們的指甲裂開來了；血，一絲一絲的……</p>
<p>仲元忽然尖聲的呌起來，喉音啞了，帶着血和淚；神經也麻木了，臨死的刺激，魔鬼的毒手，使他失去了自主力。</p>
<p>『我愿意告訴你們了，我門帶的是一封信，信裏面是說明天早上……』仲元啞聲說。</p>
<p>個子最高的人停了手，大家屏着呼吸，望着仲元。</p>
<p>突然，在一旁的孟元搶起敵人手裏的斧頭，猛烈的擊在仲元頭上。一股鮮紅的血，噴得好幾尺高。</p>
<p>接着，順着勢，他又一斧頭砍在自己喉嚨口，鮮紅的血，也噴了好幾尺遠。</p>
<p>一羣矮子兵，嚇獃了，有幾個大聲喊起來；他們看到的是人間最悲壯的一幕！</p>
<p>孟元撲倒在血泊中，痙攣地爬了過去，用顫動的手撫摩着他弟弟底身子，臉上浮起了一層最後的微笑。</p>

<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>「綠野仙踪乃淸李百川所撰，燕京大學藏有舊抄本，載作者自序。他本僅有乾隆二十九年陶序及乾隆三十六年侯序。今僅知百川爲江南人，名朱詳。（見孫楷第通俗小說書目面二四九）</p>
<p>此書第五十四回到第五十九回這六回是寫浙江平倭的。歷史人物有兪大猷·林潤·張經·嚴嵩·趙文華。胡宗憲·海瑞等，捏造的人物也有朱文煒·林岱等。事實大的是一眞九假。這一分眞實的地方，書中大都特别提出。如海瑞上疏諫君，見明史卷二二六。第五十六回寫文華進酒一節則本之明史卷三百八趙文華本傳。，『文華欲自結於帝，進百花仙酒，詭曰：「臣師嵩服之而壽。」帝飲甘之，敕問嵩。嵩驚曰：「文華安得爲此？」乃宛轉奏曰：「臣生平不近藥餌。犬馬之壽，誠不知其何以然。」嵩恨文華不先白己，召至所詈責之。文華跪泣，久不敢起。徐階李本見之，爲解，乃令去。嵩休沐歸，九卿進謁。嵩猶怒文華，令從吏扶出之。文華大窘，厚賂嵩妻，爲之解，文華即出拜，嵩乃待之如初。」</p>
<p>小說小話云：「平倭一節，詆胡梅林不留餘地，不知何意？梅林將業，雖不足觀，然功過尙足相掩，在當時節鎭中，不可謂非佼俊者，正未容一筆抹殺也。」猜想起來，大的胡宗憲與嚴嵩敷衍，被認爲嚴黨，「小说中每痛悔之一，即由於此。但胡宗憲能用戚繼光和兪大猷，也可說是知人善任的了。</p>
<p>「剿倭寇三帥成偉績」一回，大率揑造。此回叙林岱在江寗城外率百餘將士在倭寇五六萬軍中殺死夷目妙美。徐海·在眞等，顯與史實不符。所謂三帥，即指兪大猷林岱和朱文煒。按明史兪大猷傳：「新倭三十餘艘敗南京都督周干德兵。」如此說來，死守南京的陸鳳儀總督也有些靠不住了。</p>
<p>但是這六回平倭故事，大致是不錯的，如張經蒙寃。林潤彈劾嚴嵩，都是有名的史實。</p>
<p>書中寫趙文華賄倭寇六十萬金，要他們佯敗，藉此邀功，可說是把這奸賊駡苦了。而寫三帥掃蕩倭寇一節，也極爲痛快：「倭寇被官兵殺得七零八落，叉跑了五六里，見追兵漸遠，一個個尋至江邊，只有二十多隻海船。衆賊爭渡，自相殘殺，啼哭之聲，驚天動地。人多船重，叉沉了幾隻。賊衆腹中飢餒，沿途倒斃，或不能行動者，盡被官兵斬絕，何止四五千人。天明追兵又至，四處搜拿。船內賊眾正走間，忽聽得江聲振撼，一聲大砲，滿江都是戰船，大砲火箭如雨點一般打來，倭寇中箭砲者傷損幾盡，十喪其九。到焦山又被大猷火砲連船打得粉碎，水路中端的未走脫一船，生全一人。各處海口，大猷俱有埋伏，斬殺逃賊亦極多。」（節引第五十九回）倭奴大敗，眞無異曹阿瞞在赤壁大敗一樣的使人興奮。</p>

<h3 id="c110">中國金銀政策之行程 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 傑</p>
<p>戰時財政政策中的貨幣政策，在沒有實行通貨管理的時代，是改鑄硬幣，减低貨幣的價値，以增財源；在實行通貨管理的現代，則施行通貨膨脹，以資運用。但中國並沒有走向通貨膨脹的途徑，而以增加稅源發行公債去配合運用起來，作爲戰時財政的第一要策，以收集金銀政策的進行，去增加戰時財政的力量。前日本報載二十一日財部通電禁止銀錢業私購金銀而定一收購辦法，可說是搜集金銀政策的進行已到最高峯了。</p>
<p>白銀因爲在一九三五年十一月三日已經收爲國有，所以在戰時金銀政策進行最力的還是十日公佈的金類兌換法幣辦法和施行細則，規定以生金·金器·金幣或新產之金塊·金沙等兌換法幣者，給以百分之三至百分之五的手續費，購救國公債的加給百分之六，作爲法幣存款的照新定利率加給週息二釐·其次一九三八年十一月一日公佈監督銀樓業收兌金類辦法，規定銀樓業收進或售出赤金及九成金原金等概以具有飾物器具的形狀爲限，金條·金塊·金葉·沙金·礦金一概不准收售，至專以收買沙金·礦金的店鋪應向中央銀行接洽訂立承受委託合同，悉數轉售中央銀行·同年十一月中更限制私運黃金及任何形狀的金飾出口或運往淪陷區。輔助的方法是：在救國公債募集辦法中規定國幣·硬幣·外幣·生金銀等，在金公債中規定生金或金幣等得購買公債。</p>
<p>以上主要的輔助的辦法對於金銀的收集，可說已很詳密·不過中國在施行法幣政策時，對於以六成正貨，四成保證向發行銀行領用法幣的辦法，并未廢止，故在戰時收集金銀政策的進展上，不無缺陷—主要辦法中雖於收購運輸有明確的規定，但對於藉名收購充作領券準備的一點，是沒有顧到。所以財部電令金融業，規定各地銀錢業曾向中·中·交·農四行締結領券合約的，因而收購金銀充爲準備的，應先報明接洽領券的發行銀行，並報請收兌金銀辦事處，照案委託辦理，杜絕投機或走私的弊端。假使未經締結領券合的，又不報請委託的，則以私購牟利論，按情節的不同，酌爲處分。此項辦法，耍關涉到發行銀行和收兌金銀辦事處的兩個機關，當然不易發生弊端，則對於投機或走私，自易於防止或杜絕。</p>
<p>此項規定辦法，對於中國戰時財政顯有可能發生的利益，常有下列兩點：</p>
<p>第一是法幣的深入民間。單就白銀說，自法幣制度實行之後，政府所收集的白銀，除去各銀行原有的準備金不計外，在一九三六年六日底止，共爲二萬二千五百萬元·但據估計，歷年輸入出的結果，國內最少應有存銀七萬萬元，最低限度可能集中者當有三寓萬五千萬元，則國內最少應尙有半數散在民間。現在規定各地銀錢行莊得收購充作領券準備金，是使得法幣更能普遍的流入窮鄉僻壤。</p>
<p>第二是海外資金的增加。所謂海外資金即是能够供爲國際間支付的財貨。目今世界各國雖然均已停止金本位，但是黃金在國際收支上仍是保有價値儲藏的職能。至如白銀，雖沒有黃金那樣有儲藏的職能，但在中美貨幣協定下，中國不難將白銀易爲黃金。現在通過此項辦法的運用，則對於收集各地金銀，比較單藉收兌金銀辦事處去辦理，自然更易收效，而迅速地增加海外的資金。</p>
<p>中國戰時收集金銀政策的進展，就本文第二段所論述，以至於現在施行的銀錢業收購金銀辦法，可見收集的方法愈趨多元化，防弊的章則，愈形嚴密化，而在短短的一年半間已進行到如此地步，殊可贊許。至於以收集金銀作爲戰時財政政策中的貨幣政策，代替了通貨膨脹的貨幣政策，以與租稅公債互相配合的政策平行運用起來，這一種的戰時財政政策，是値得研究的。</p>

<p>— 胡錫山</p>
<p>推動小單位制生產建設</p>
<p>自抗戰開始迄今十九個月，各工業之自戰區遷向內地，及在西南各省新建者，爲數匪少，此實爲吾國抗戰中之一良好現象。蓋欲加强抗戰之力量，首要乃在謀全國國民總生產量之增加。蓋一國政府之執行其職務，所使用者，並非是貨幣，而是實質上的物資與勞力。在平時狀態下，政府固可自每年國民的所得中，取得定額貨幣收入，以購入所需之物資與勞力。故平時國家財政之來源，可基於國民的收益，所得以及消費之上。但國家一旦進入於戰時的狀態，則其所需之物資與勞力數倍於平時，而其需要之性質更屬急不容緩。在此種情態下，政府欲應付這環境，則絕不能全賴之於租稅，而應盡力的利用國內的一切資源，加增全國國民的總生產量，以期獲得大量的物資，來供應戰時鈞一般需要。</p>
<p>在吾國目前的情形下，日本運用其經濟與武力，雙管齊下的企圖摧殘吾國的一切經濟事業。在各戰區中它佔奪了吾國的市塲與一切資源。同時利用武力將各戰區中所有的工廠，强佔硬覇，僅就京滬一帶言，吾國百分之七十最新的大規模工廠，已被損毀或佔有；吾國所有工業區包括天津·上海·無錫·南京·廣東·武漢等地，其所有之生產機能，亦已被全部消滅。蓋日本唯一的企圖，是想把中國整個生產能力全行消毀，而使中國抗戰上的物資所需，整僩的依賴於國外的輸入；同時，它更從事的來破壞與阻止外來物資的輸入，而使中國失却其長期抗戰的力量，一切均在日人把持操縱之下，這一種企圖，在事實上，雖屬一個夢想的政策；但，在目前中國各大城市及經濟機能爲日人摧毀與侵奪之下，倘吾國不速謀重行建設及力圖經濟生產力之加强，則將墮入日本彀中了。</p>
<p>故加强生產機構實爲吾國目前之急務；雖吾國自開戰以來，一般生產仍源源不絕的在後方發展着，但依吾國現今的經濟機構而論，這些並不能充份地來適應整個抗戰的需要，所以，吾們認爲大規模的發展小單位制工業，於中國目前的情態下，實應有推動的必要。什麼是大規模的發展小單位制工業？透切的說：就是全國在抗戰期中大量的建設小資本單位的實業內，散佈地建設起巨數的生產單位，來奠定長期抗戰中的經濟基礎，同時以補償戰區中所損失的一切生產能力。</p>
<p>實際上，來推動這小單位的實業生產，理由絕非單純的基於欲加强一般的生產機構，擴大一點的說，是爲着適應吾國抗戰上整個部份的需要，此點，吾人可從下列的各點以分述之：</p>
<p>（一）小資本工業最可取之點，乃籌設上之利便，此可從二方面分析之：　在資金方面：以人民一般的投資心理而說，在戰時的狀態下，私人的投資者，對於大規模實業之投資，往往認爲是一種冒險，是爲必然之現象，而對於提出其一部份的資金來從事於小資本的工業上，則事實上比較可能，同時更可使社會上一部份游散的資金，引導入正當的生產事業上。其次從設立上言之，建立一個大規模的實業，在平時尙多困難之點；何况於戰時，不論動力與機器之設計，原料之取得，技術人材之征集等種種問題，勢必加倍的困難，而小資本工業，則以簡便易舉爲前提，故易於解决上述各項的問題，且可儘量的利用各地的資源，作爲生產之依據。</p>
<p>（二）蓋欲大量生產以適應巨額的需要，而以大規模的工業集中於一地，則造成敵軍佔領及轟炸之標的，使此等生產之組織，失其安全的保障。且一旦在必要時，不易遷移，例如京滬·武漢各地之各工廠，因機件之不易遷移而遭受損害者，爲數在十萬萬元以上，故爲欲避免此種的損害及保持生產的實力，則不如化大爲小，於內地各處大量的設立小規模的工廠，此不僅可維護整個的生產力，且可建立一個將來經濟發展上的堅强基礎，蓋吾國一切金融與實業之組織，向集中於少數的城市中，內地雖資源蘊藏，而人口稀少，荒凉非凡，此種不平危機。今日即可利用小單位之實業組織，在這些未經開發之區域內，建下一個據點。日後即可以此據點爲根據發展而擴大之，同時更可以聯合若干的單位，依其地域的分配而建立爲一强力的工業中心，則不僅在計劃上可統籌一切，且為未來的生產建設上，開闢了一條穩固而實在之途徑。</p>
<p>（三）小單位制工業之推動，可直接的對軍事有接濟的效用，因其能供應抗戰前綫之需要。　設立大規模之工業，須採用重大的機械，僱用大量的勞工，必須以巨大的廠房建築以容納之，方能從事生產，故必須建立於後方安全之區，此種工業，其於能率上言之，固可構成政府所計劃的實業機構，而完成各部重要供給之生產，然其不若小規模工業之輕易而合於移動的原則，得設立於附近前綫的各區域，蓋於戰地之前綫，所需各種物質上之供給殊大，且大都具有急需之性質，但事實上則往往因運輸不便而受阻等等的原因，很難從後方應其所需地之迅速供給。在此種傷合之下，就很需要在前錢的近區，設立直接供應的單位，以利軍事之接濟·這種要求，大規模的實業，就很難合乎條件，而獨有小規模的工業可適應之。</p>
<p>（四）大規模的推動小資本工業，可解决吾國當前的難民問題，蓋吾國自戰事爆發以來，因戰區之　大，難民與日俱增，故今日難民之給養，已成爲吾國一嚴重問題·據估計目前全國至少有五千萬至六千萬的難民，陷於困苦的情境，其生活完全的依於政府或其他社會團體的維持，像這一種事實的存在，對於政府社會均有直接的損害，蓋這巨額的難民非僅是失其生產能力，且須供以巨額的消費，且日後難民的增加，尙有繼續不斷的可能，設長此以往，實不利於吾國長期抗戰之計劃。在大量小單位制工業推動之下，這些浪費着的勞動力，便有了生產的可能，同時，每月數百萬元的難民給養之需，亦可利用於生產之途徑上。</p>
<p>（五）小單位工業制度，可充任發展農村經濟組織之中心，蓋由於大嚴人口的向內地各農村的遷移，各荒凉之區，一且而成爲人口麕集之地，物質需要，頓時大增，然於自給自足的農村中，何來此巨額的物質以供需要？在此情狀下，則洋貨與劣貨之乘機輸入，自屬難免，而小資本工業的散佈於各地，則可隨地生產而應當地需要，繁榮荒凉之區而開發市傷，以振興農村經濟，同時更爲防止洋貨劣貨輸入的一條有效的警戒錢。</p>
<p>綜上數點，可明推動小單位制工業，對吾國抗戰計劃上，實有莫大的利點，且於今日各重要都市之經濟機能爲敵人摧毀之下，吾國對此更感有急切之需要。</p>
<p>應當怎樣的來推動這一個計劃，此亦爲吾人所應討論之點。夫欲建立巨量的小單位工業，實爲一偉大之計劃，絕非一朝一夕所能期實現，所以吾們希望能一步一步的按次序而進行之。爲求推動上的利便，最初當有一基本之組織，來作爲推動之中心·這個中心組織的首步工作，當舉辦一個概况的調查；這一個概况的調查，包括二項工作：一爲估計或調查目下物資需要之性質以及程度，蓋不明需要情形，試問將何以供應其需要？故此爲一確定生產之基本目標。根據此目標，亦即可確定應有之生產類別，依其重要决要而審核其緩急，加以調劑。其二當依地域之分配而調查各區資源之分佈情形，而分劃各單位之設立。有了這二個具體的目標，也就奠定了建設之基礎。同時，政府當運用激勵的方法，促進全國人民擴大投資於小單位工業之意志，並運用種種積極的方法，予以籌設上的便利協助以及保障，而使這一個正當投資的泉源，得以順利的推行。</p>
<p>有了具體的目標，確定了進行的計劃，同時在推行之管理上，亦當有一完備之組織，以爲統制及指導之中樞，使各個小單位在一體的行動下，獲得合理而良好的效率·茲分述統制及指導應有之點，略抒管見：</p>
<p>蓋統制者是以一團體之力量與方法，而對單位活動的種類，及範圍加以根本的管理是也，小單位制工業的分配於各地，設不加統制，則勢必造成散漫而不統一之現象，對小單位制工業統制之入手，有二個原則：（一）生產上的統制，（二）原料上的統制。生產上的統制：是在使各單位之生產，其供給與需要之程度能相適應，以防止不需的浪費及生產上的不平衡，同時更須促進單位生產之標準化，此非僅是指每一單位當標準化，而欲促進整個單位生產的標準化，蓋標準化之切效可使：（一）生產正確，（二）以少數之種類，而獲巨額的產量，使適應戰時的需要，（三）製品之事務可以簡單，而製品之完成可迅速而精良，（四）因生產的標準，則原斜及製造費的浪費可以减少。</p>
<p>關於原料上的統制，其重要性當過於生產；蓋戰時生產以軍需爲上。故原料統制上的第一個原則，須使軍需品之製造，其原料當有優先之使用權，如甲乙兩工廠，其所用爲同一原料，但乙工廠爲普通工廠，而甲工廠之製品爲供軍需之用。於此二者之下，則當使甲工廠對該原料獲得優先之使用權。因戰時對於軍需工業之原料，若不加統制，而使重要之生產獲得優先之使用權，則對軍事上之妨礙殊大。試舉歐戰時之美國爲例：蓋美國於參戰後，對東部工業地方，定下軍需品及軍需原料六萬件，於此巨額的物品中，其對於軍事價値有大有小有急有緩。但因缺乏統制之故，其中往往軍事價値較小或需要較緩者，反得先行生產。而其中急不容緩之軍需品，反因原料之缺乏，而不能製造。以致美國當時的戰時生產，陷入極端混亂之狀態，故際此非常時期，吾國對原料之統制，實不能忽視，否則影響所及，對軍事上之妨礙非淺也。</p>
<p>其次指導與改善亦頗重要，蓋指導是一種合理的啟示，改善便是前進的出發，於此戰時狀態下爲求全國國民總生產量之加增，政府對於生產及原料旣有統制之必要，則對於生產內部之一切亦應予以指導及改進；此可別爲作業·組織·勞動，機械·四部份，關於作業上：（一）作業方法的合理指導及生產技術的改進；（二）作業分工與合作系統連絡之能否適合；（三）對於作業時間休息時間應予合理之分配指示；（四）人與工程間能率之連絡。關於組織上：（一）組織系統之指導，（二）工務事務之劃分；關於勞動方面：（一）改進工人生活之實施；（二）工人動作之指導；使工人動作之單純，疲勞减輕，而求工作效率之加强。（三）從工人製造缺點上的發現，而予以方法上的改善與指導。歸納言之，際此非常時期之下，加强生產機構，實爲吾國當前之急務，大規模發展小單位制工業之生產，其重要性實與大企業相同，且其可取之點，實勝於大企業，而能切合戰時環境，故推動小單位制工業，實爲吾國今日戰時工業建設上應有之途徑</p>
<p>編者按唯動小單位制生產建設，的是要圖，但尙有兩點，似爲筆者所忽略，（一）爲小型機器之獲得，蓋小單位制生產建設，是爲慮大工業遭敵人之把持，或未適應內地生產之情况，故其性質爲介於手工業與機器工業之間，近來內地人士亦已有鑒及此，不觀連日本報常有來函徵詢小型磨粉機紡紗機之事乎？惟此種機件，如何製造，從何獲得，亦爲小單位生產建設之先决條件。（二）日軍所占領之地域，多爲城市，故在城市之工業，常爲所霸占統制，若欲不爲所利用，只有移轉於鄉村去。然在鄉村建築起小工業單位，保護而孕育之者，有賴於游擊軍。假如游擊軍不能負此責任，結果，仍將爲人所覇佔統制去，此亦値得深長思也。故游擊軍之責任，不僅在破壞對方工作，又在組織保護游擊區內人民財產，助長其建設，以爲異日民族工業復興之基也。</p>

<h3 id="c112">最近盛行市上之巴西棉 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 迪軒</p>
<p>過去因國內棉花生產少而銷費多，不得不輸入大量外棉以濟不足，至民國二十三年竟達三百七十萬擔之鉅，其後中央與各省均積極改進植棉，外棉進口激減，近年已不足五十萬擔，與輸出幾相平衡。八一三以後，紡廠大半停工，銷棉大减，棉花進口幾絕。詎自上年（二十七年）十一月起，上海紗廠購進外棉甚多，其主要原因，爲鄂豫魯陝等省之棉無法運滬，來源僅恃蘇浙兩省所產及天津出口之少量棉花而已，此項棉花之以交通不便，運輸費用奇昂，成本大增，而外棉適以存底甚豐，跌至最低價格，雖外匯大縮，其換算價已與上海棉價接近，有時或且較低，遂致沉寂已久之外棉交易，忽吿繫盛。此對於戰時國家經濟，殊不利也。</p>
<p>歷來我國進口外棉，有美棉印度與埃及棉三種。邇來驟增巴西棉一種。巴西棉產向不著名，我國輸入尤少，茲忽與美印棉並駕齊驅，試觀本報現棉交易，巴西棉每逾千包，不讓於美印棉花，埃及棉更無論矣。棉業界對此現象，頗引爲異，而對於巴西棉之認識亦殊不多，據余觀測，在現狀之下，此種棉花之輸人，頗能持久不衰。因略述巴西棉之概况，以備棉界之參考。</p>
<p>巴西棉產，在昔並不著聞。在一九三三年尙不足五十萬包，僅能自給。是年以後，政府積極推廣植棉，棉田產量驟增。一九三三—三四年一季即增至一百萬包。（每包四百七十八磅）一九三五—三六年一季再增至一百七十六萬五千包，較三年增逾三倍。一九三六—三七年爲一百七十一萬二千包。一九三七—三八年又增至二百二十萬三千包，較一九三三年增四倍半强。棉產進步之速，實堪驚人，以其增率觀之，不久即將與我國相埒。巴西北部最廣，亞瑪遜河交錯其間，但以氣候卑濕，不宜耕種，故植棉完全在南部。就其植棉地帶，可分爲南北兩部，植棉之發展，以南部為著，一九三一—三二年南部產棉十二萬六千包，北部產四十二萬九千包，至一九三七年—三八年南部爲一百四十萬四千包，北部爲七十八萬七千包。植棉最多者爲南部濱海之聖保羅省（Sao　Paulo)，產額占全國之半，其餘均不及十分之一，故棉市中心即在聖保羅市。巴西產棉允有可稱述者，即每畝產量之奇高是已，在聖保羅省每英畝最大產量有達一千英磅者，五百磅者甚普通，該州之Sorocabana區平均收量恒在四百五十磅，埃及向稱產量最高亦僅三百五十磅，我國與美國均在二百磅左右，不及其半，惟北部產量甚低，全國平均並不過高耳。因其主要棉區之每畝產量甚高，巴西之一般工資又低，故巴西棉花之成本較廉。據報告所載，瑪太棉之生產成本每磅約爲兩便士，如以我國法定之英幣匯價計算，僅合一角四分，我國植棉之最低成本，亦遠在此數之上，美棉更無待言。本報所戰巴西棉市價，比較同等級之美棉為低，殆以此故。</p>
<p>棉花之種類，在巴西有多年生之木棉及一年生之棉花兩大類，木棉可長十五年，纖維頗長，革本棉之種類亦繁，大多數爲美國陸地棉種。故其所產棉花之纖維，有能紡一百支以上之紗綫，亦有短至十五mm者，普通以二十七至三十五mm爲多。在聖保羅省設有分級局，對於棉花分爲九級，據報吿一九三六及一九三七兩年所產棉花各級所占百分之數如下：「一九三六年」一級無，二級〇·〇六，三級二·六四，四級一四·八四，五級三八·二五，六級二二·七五，七級一七·〇九，八級五·五四，九級一·一七，次九級〇·四四·「一九三七年」一級無，二級〇·三二，三級六·八五，四級二九·八五，五級三五·四一，六級一七·八〇，七級五·九一，八級一·七五，九級二·四五，次九級〇·一六。大致其普通棉花與美棉密得林相接近，合於紡製如我國之中級紗支之用，足以代替中等之美棉與高級之印棉。</p>
<p>巴西之棉紡業，亦有相當地位，在歐戰以前，國內紡錠計一百二十萬枚，其後逐步發展，最近已增至二百七十萬枚　所用之原棉完全爲本國所產，因其長短絨俱備，無須外求。其銷棉量一九三四—三五年一季爲五十八萬七千包，（每包五百磅）三五—三六年爲六十五萬四千包，三六—三七年爲七十一萬零三千包，三七—三八年爲六十二萬包，此外一般的消費的七萬包。故巴西棉產在昔僅足自給，近年產額增加後，遂吿過剩而運銷於國外。大致恃其植棉成本較低之故，當此美印棉輸出不振之時，而巴西棉之輸出，竟隨其生產之進步而激增。據巴西農部之報吿，巴西棉輸出，以每包一百八十公斤之包計，一九三五年七十七萬包，一九三六年一百十一萬三千包，一九三七年一百三十一萬二千包，所產之棉，除自用外，幾於悉數輸出。輸出之國別，以一九三七年言，德第一，計四十七萬包，日次之，計二十八萬三千包，英又次之，計二十六萬三千包，（一九三六年爲三十六萬包）此外法七萬包，意四萬四千包，葡四萬包，凡世界之主要消棉國，幾皆有之。即產棉之美國亦有一萬二千包，印度一千包，我國在一九三六年爲一萬一千六百二十八包，一九三七年增至二萬二千九百七十二包。據國際農會之世界棉花貿易統計報吿，在輸出國中，巴西已晋居第四位，蓋僅次於美印與埃及而已。</p>
<p>巴西因棉區氣候不同，栽種收穫之時期亦異。在棉帶之北部，其收棉期的自本年八月至翌年一月，南部較遲，約爲三月至六月。故在聖保羅之「棉季」以二月底爲止，與美印埃及我國之以七八月爲棉季終期，相差甚遠。因此巴西政府對棉產佔計之時期，南北不同，例如在南部棉產第一次估計時，北部已完全成第三次估計矣。</p>
<p>巴西植棉之發展，爲時尙短，對於棉花經濟方面之工作，猶在積極改進之中。往時軋花尙用滾軸，影響品質甚鉅，旋以政府統制軋花，改用鋸齒機，大有裨於棉花品級，政府已厲行分級工作，目前出口之棉，大數均經過分級；棉花貿易方法，亦在改善，若干大規模之棉行，漸有在巴西棉區設軋花廠從事收棉者，如向在我國經營美棉之美安洋行，即其一家.今後巴西棉之貿易，無論在國際間及我國市傷均將愈趨活躍，而受其影響者，當然爲美棉與印度棉也。商業新聞</p>

<p>上海是我國東方最大的都市·上海民衆的生活，是都市的生活。都市生活的缺點，是住屋狹小，空氣汚濁。所以都市民衆的身體，因受環境的限制，不如農村民衆的身體健康；上海民衆，自然也不能例外。</p>
<p>健身運動，是上海民衆所需要的。從前，上海地方當局，曾在無綫電臺上，廣播民衆早操的口令，指導民衆在每天工作開始之前，做幾節健身運動。這個辦法，非常之好。不過因無指定運動塲所，不能集團運動，成績未見顯著。最好委托專人，分區指定地點，實地領導民衆，到傷運動，較易收效。現在我且提出幾點意見於下：</p>
<p>（一）名稱　呌「海民衆健身運動」，暫定早操一項。以後如有可能，再行擴充。</p>
<p>（二）主辦人　由熱心地方事業團體主辦，最好請上海男女靑年會擔任。</p>
<p>（三）塲所　將全市劃分若干區，每區指定一個學校操塲或一塊空地，爲早操運動傷所。</p>
<p>（四）指導員　每一區設男女指導員各一人。</p>
<p>（五）運動時間　每天上午七時起，至多一小時，或隔日舉行。</p>
<p>（五）運動節目　除規定幾節早操外，在運動之前，可以喊幾句健身的口號。運動之後，可以唱一首健身歌，使身心同感興奮。</p>
<p>我們知道，有健全的身體，才有健全的事業。不注意健身運動，不獨影響於身體的健康，且足以影響於事業的發展。希望上海民衆，一致提倡實行。</p>

<h3 id="c121">帮助人們工作的—滑車 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 吳光</p>
<p>滑車，通常一般人是很熟習的東西，不過滑車的應用，却不是一般人所能完全了解的，現在我們借本刋的一角，來談談滑車。</p>
<p>滑車，在日常生活上，功用很大，牠可以使人用很小的氣力，舉很大的東西，並且可以使貨物上升到很高的地方。讀者們當然看到過輪船上上貨下貨吧？同時也看到過電梯的升降吧？其實，這其中滑車的作用，盡了很大的功能。</p>
<p>滑車，由三部分構造而成，第一部是滑輪，輪係圓板，周圍切凹槽以容繩索。第二部爲滑輪的支架，通常爲橢圓形的木塊，中間挖空，以容滑車。兩壁承受着滑輪的軸，以資支持。第三部爲繩索，運行在滑輪內，用以提升貨物。</p>
<p>滑車的起源　最初人類欲使重物升高，必須先立一人，在目的物所應升高的地位，然後冉用力提上物品，（如第一圖）</p>
<p>但是此法雖可减少一部分氣力，然工作者必須立在很高的地方，很不方便，於是進一步而有第二圖的方法，工作者立在下面，只要將繩一拉，重物便可上升。較前者已便利許多。但是這種方法，還是不好，因爲繩和木棍的阻力太大，拉起來仍舊很費氣力。後來經過相當的研究，有人發明了一個合理的東西，那就是滑車。</p>
<p>這種滑車，掛在高處，工人只要將繩于一拉，那末貨物上升也容易，下降也容易，一點不費氣力。</p>
<p>滑車的進化　上項的滑車是「空滑車」。僅可改變施力的方向，而不能有機械的助益，因爲若在繩的一端，施以一百斤傳達於他端的，也是一百斤，原因是上圖所用的「定滑車」物品的重量，只由一根繩牽引，阻力太大，所以並不十分省力，假是能用第四圖之「動滑車」，那末力就更省。因爲動滑車，有兩根繩牽引，阻力减小到一半，所以二斤重的貨物，拉起來只有一斤重了。但是依照第四圖的動滑車，經科學家研究，雖可有機械的助益，而施力方向，仍須向上牽引，很不方便，所以後來父有人發明一個動滑車，再加上一個定滑車，那麼困難就解决了。如第五圖所示，繩之一端繞過動滑車後，再繞過一個定滑車，這樣不特可以得到動滑車的助力，也可由定滑車而改變施力的方向。</p>
<p>這樣看來滑車的進化改進不少了。</p>
<p>滑車的效能　不過滑車的進度，還有改進的餘地，比方說吧，連合數個固定的和活動的滑車在一起，不是更可以省力嗎？對啦，只要注意拉繩的長短，和貨物上升的距離，就可以得到滑車的更大的助力，聯合使用多數滑車的方法，也有幾種。</p>
<p>（一）每一個動滑車座於一繩上，每繩的一端，釘在架樑的上面，除第一根繩外，其餘各繩的另一端，都繞過一個動滑車，而接在前面一個動滑車之下，第一根繩的另一端，則繞過一個定滑車，而緊握在工作者的手中，如第六圖所示，則十六斤的貨物，經過幾個周轉，而所費的氣力，只有一斤了。</p>
<p>（二）還有一種裝置，比前一種更靈活，不佔地方，使用時更簡單而便利，那就是如第七圖的裝置了。這種裝置，應用極廣，直到現在爲止，舉凡運輸建樂之傷合，皆有廣汎的應用。</p>
<p>總括以上所說，雖未將繩之長短與貨物重量之比例，詳細說明，但滑車構造之原理，已有概要之說明，現在科舉發達，有人以鋼鏈，來代替繩索，更以鐵製滑車，代替木製滑車，並用齒輪機構，代替平面之輪盤，更且以發動機，來代替人力·這樣一來，滑車之功用，實在是鷲人。</p>
<p>在一本科學畫報上，還登載着一個有趣的試騐：牠的題目是「一個孩子把四個壯丁拉在一起」，讀者們，會不相信吧？茲介紹在下面，以供試騐</p>
<p>壯丁四人，分作兩組，每組兩人，各持一堅硬木棍，互相對立着，用一根結實的蔴繩，一端挽結在右邊一根棍上，然後再往復繞過二棍共三匝，使兩棍間共有六條繩索。其最後伸出的繩索，使一個孩子執着，這就可以試騐了。</p>
<p>假定這四個壯丁，每人氣力有一百二十斤，那末，這個孩子，就只消用四十斤的氣力，便可以將四個壯丁，拉合在一起·這個道理，實在說起來，等聯滑車的作用一樣。</p>

<p>— 唐榮愷</p>
<p>敎育是一個國家生命之維他命，關係整個國家强弱存亡，在平時應該談敎育，而在道非常時期更應該談敎育，自一九二六年八一三戰事爆發後，造成空前浩刧，成千成萬被難同胞，流離失所，麕集在孤島上，此等難胞，刧後殘生，雖得維持最低生活，可是我人對於難胞所負責任，是何等重大，給養爲生命之延續，敎育爲精神之食糧，可知難敎之重要了。</p>
<p>談難民敎育，確非一件容易的事情，在特殊的環境下，辦非常的敎育，困難殊多，更非平時敎育所可比擬·是要從實踐地經騐中來體會，來應付這非常時期的難民敎育，在措置上，在經騐上，是要抱苦幹的精神，才能得到一點效果，作者服務難民敎育年餘，所得到的經騐，概略的談談，作爲一種難竄敎育的參考，掛一漏萬，尙祈識者隨時指正。（未完）</p>

<p>華南的戰局，始終是比晋西要激烈，數周以來，已有事實證明。</p>
<p>在不久以前，日軍曾幾度進攻西北，修築鐵路，增援渡河，打算乘冰凍黃河之際，一鼓而直達陝西，可是近月以來，進攻並未得手，其企圖早爲華軍預定計劃而殭化了。最近西北戰局，轉趨沉寂，雖然還不能斷定從此便無戰事，但在事實上，牠沒有舉動是很不合算的。</p>
<p>所以，牠只有在華南才是很好的目標；因爲擴大華南戰事，與牠的目前形勢，頗爲吻合，地勢旣甚切要，運輸又很便利，即退一步想，日方若欲威脅英法，聯絡德義，也是一個絕好的處所。</p>
<p>有了道些理由，我們便可以選擇些有關消息，讓讀者參考。</p>
<p>「粵省日軍，仍陸續增援，潿州島附近，日艦又增至十三艘，內有航空母艦驅逐艦各搜，運輸艦淺水艦各二艘，日內游弋海面運輸給養」</p>
<p>「三水方面日軍連日增援，一部有同小北江移動，犯粵漢路日軍，更圖進襲四會，斜撲肇慶之背，據外人觀察日軍在華南將分三路進攻，一在北海登陸，沿公路北進，侵入桂南，以切斷桂越間聯絡，一沿西江進犯肇慶梧州，另一路或迂迴前進，以侵入桂東，並威脅華軍之背，東江則採佯攻形勢，以爲牽制。」</p>
<p>「據海通廿一日電傳粵漢路附近戰事異常况寂，雙方均在調整陣容，自廣東軍田經花縣以至從化一帶均爲軍運倥偬調動繁忙之區，而西江日軍正向金利廬包進犯」。</p>
<p>「又，廿三日香港電法國戰艦數艘，已於昨是離海防駛往廣州彎，衆信此與日本海軍在　洲海峡之活動有關，外人方面消息，法當局現正密切注意雷州半島區域之發展，蓋恐一旦該處發生戰事，將危及廣州灣之安全也」。</p>

<h3 id="c133">諾貝爾和平獎金 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 桑子</p>
<p>諾貝爾（Alfrde　Itermbard　Nobel　1833-1896）是瑞典化學家，他發明以硝酸甘油等製成炸藥，而成爲巨富；死後，他將大部份財產捐為諾貝爾獎金基本金（Nobel　Prizes），總額約有一百七十萬鎊，每年以其利息，充在世界第一流學者的獎金一分爲五：一物理，二化學，三醫學及生理，四文學，五盡力於國際和平者；每種每年獎金約爲七千五百鎊。據有人說：諾貝爾的創立此項獎金，是爲了懺悔自己的業績。因爲他意料不到黷武者竟會利用他的發明來戕害同類。這句話，雖屬持之有故，但不免覺得有些刻薄。我們以爲：這獎金對於人類文明的進化是有很大的貢獻和輔助的。</p>
<p>據電訊　瑞典國會議員十二人最近向挪威國諾貝爾獎金委員會建議；一九三九年度的和平獎金，應贈予張伯倫，理由是因爲一九三八年九月間，歐洲因爲捷克問題，局勢阽危，卒賴張伯倫的力量，挽回浩刼，其功實不可沒。（二十五日路透社瑞京電）</p>
<p>是的，張伯倫去秋以年邁之身，携帶雨傘，二度飛往慕尼黑，居然將那時戰雲瀰漫的歐局澄淸下來，而透露出一綫的和平曙光。我們不能說不是他的現實主義，綏靖政策的成功。歐洲人士得免重罹戰爭浩刼，他的功勞是値得頌揚的。然而歐局的危機，是否如一般瑞典國會議員所感到的那麼樂觀，現在已經消除了呢？英前外交次官克蘭波子爵最近在韋茅斯演說：「英國目前態度的軟弱，適使戰禍愈近，渠未見德義有響應張伯倫和平政策之徵象。」（同日路透社倫敦電）這是極中肯的答復。換句話說：張伯倫的現實主義和綏靖政策，非但沒有促進和平，相反的，恰加速戰禍的來臨。同時捷克期拉夫因爲慕尼黑協定曾將蘇合德區煤炭供給，完全剝奪而去，現在已不得不取救急辦法，將高速度飛機引擎與飛機零件，供給德國，以防此項燃料的缺乏了。（同日路透社捷京電）是則，和平未成，捷克斯拉夫已感受被宰割之苦痛矣。孰令使之？孰令致之？非張伯倫之和平政策耶？</p>
<p>倘使說：諾貝爾和平獎金是獎勵犧牲弱小政策的，那麼簡直是多餘的，何况犧牲弱小還不能換取黷武的法西斯蒂的悲惘，還不能消滅黷武的法西斯蒂的野心呢？</p>
<h3 id="c134">漫談小賬 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 廷康</p>
<p>最近從香港回來的一位朋友說，他在那裏一家大酒樓裏宴客，因爲覺得香港比前奢華，從前他給小賬祇有十元這次加一倍給二十，不料那些侍者都淡淡的不以爲意，後來他方明白自從上海的闊老們到的香港以後，他們給小賬，起碼總是一百跟八十的，這是使我「大吃一驚」。</p>
<p>在都市型十足的社會裏，小賬這一項本在畸形地發展，據倫敦一個所得稅員調查，在酒館裏的一個僕歐平均每年獲得一千鎊的小賬，並不算多，所以也列入「容易賺錢」的一類裏，而小賬因此格外被人重視。很多小賬的收入超過份內明定薪水一二倍還不止的。</p>
<p>從前上海寗波綫的航輸裏的茶房，是以拿小賬出名的，普通二元錢的一個房艙客位，你的酒錢至少總要給二元錢，一個茶房能管四五隻客位，他每月平均收入五六百元，實在算不得一回事，所以不少茶房因此而成小康的（大部反以收入容易而染上了抽鴉片聚賭的惡習），後來國營招商局等的船隻都將酒資歸公司代收，小賬之風才稍殺。</p>
<p>據一個京戲館裏當案目的說，他最歡迎帶着孩子的女太太和年紀已大的商賈，他們往往一元錢的票價，小賬給上二三元，現在幸得有些戲館已把案目廢止，那末根本就沒有小賬了。</p>
<p>有人曾痛心疾首的說，小賬制度不推翻，中國社會永遠是這樣勢利這然而推源到小賬，這是自己弄壞的，你給了一百元，別人給二十元的就不免受冷淡了，自然，受賞者是不會想到不論一百和二十都屬額外，而給人看二種顏色，是絕不應該的。</p>
<p>我又想到另外二種日常生活中所碰到的事情：上理髮店和浴室。譬如規定剪髮二角修面一角，但有人一給就是四角六角，除規定的外，其餘自然又是小賬，他給你理得特別仔細道地，你於是多賞點，但想不到那些照規矩給的反受到歧視的待遇了，以此大家心照不宣的照規定的多給，這樣第一個做瘟頭，下面一個個都非做瘟頭不可，實在說起來，他給你理得道地點，也是份內事。</p>
<p>其他像在過年過節的時候，結婚做壽等喜事等，總免不吧要給賞錢，這似乎也是變相的小賬；差僕役送禮給親戚朋友時，「回來總帶回幾角或幾元的敬使台力」，這不能說是小賬的一種嗎？</p>
<p>例子太多了，這社會好似給小賬包圍着，雖然有些人專靠小賬來維持生活，但我希望給小賬的不要超乎入情才是。</p>
<h3 id="c135">閹人 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 小于先生</p>
<p>從前曾經養過一只貓。聽了老媽子的建議，把牠閹子。果然那畜生長雄壯非凡，但有一椿缺點，便是閹了之後，就此失魂落魄的只知吃睏，也不在晚上拿耗子，也不在春天找戀人。</p>
<p>翻開一月二十五日的申報，誰知赫然觸目的頭一張就有日議員建議割生殖腺的一個標題。據說厚生省因老百姓反對這個德（？）政而不敢換切從事，因而惹起民政黨兩議員的嚴辭詆責他們的迂謹不中用。這個閹人政策列入皇皇束亞盟主反共軸心新秩序發明家襲封一等强國的神聖議會的議程之中，眞是文明透頂於今爲烈了。</p>
<p>我不知道這兩位議員老爺是不是老百姓的代表？他倆難道眼看「老總」（軍人也）們的窮兵黷武，倒行逆施，動不動拿「大和魂」呀，忠君愛國呀等等的大帽子來逼着老百姓俯首貼耳的供他做砲灰來打同文同種的中國，還覺犧牲得不澈底，想把老百姓變成淸一色的呆頭呆腦的閹貓。</p>
<p>我倒替日本老百姓想了一個主意，便是卽以其人之道還治其人之身。爲今之計，爽性大家起來把這些軍閥和軍閥一鼻孔出氣的政客們先閹他一下。看他們做了閹貓，太監之後還會這樣窮兇極惡不？再說日後也好少生幾個翻江攪海煮豆燃萁的混世小魔王，和爲虎作倀欺壓同胞的半弔子</p>
<h3 id="c136">文化街靜後的動 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>四馬路，河南路的一角，書店和儀器公司林立產，一向被認為文化之街。在我們的體驗上，知道每一個年頭，寒假，暑假過后，開學的時候，文化街上，格外來得熱鬧，而其餘可算是靜止的時期。</p>
<p>為了在「孤島」上，敎育界在無領導的形態下，這一回的假期，各學校也就不統一，有些參差，有的在寒假期內，有的己開學了。因此，這幾天，文化街上，經過了幾個月的靜止而后，又在活動起來了。</p>
<p>先就幾家大書店說來，所出版的書籍，固不止一種，但教科書是整千整百的批發出去，銷數之大，比仟何文學書或科學書不知大過多少。因此，賺過不少錢：因此，到了開學時節，每一家書店，對於敎科書，聚精會神，來一次競爭。</p>
<p>這幾天，我們走過這文化之街，留心他們的櫥窗里所陳列的，完全是教科書，其他各種書籍是失蹤了。玻璃窗上，貼著「書籍文具，廉價發售」的字體，有的更用簡單的廣告書，放在櫥窗后面，作為教科書的襯托。</p>
<p>在這文化街上，我們耍是注意一下，男女靑年，每一個都忙著向書店或儀器店里進出。這里面，也有穿著校服，偑有校徽的，還有年輕的小學生，不是三五個在一起，便是由家長攙着，進去買書。出來的時候，十九手里拿幾包書籍，文具，而門口站着的賣筆者，會釘着他們，問一聲「筆要哇」</p>
<p>走進這幾家大書店裏，作一度巡行，每一雙櫃柱上面，擠滿了買書的人，店員滿頭汗，忙得來不及招呼顧客，允其是出售教科書的那雙櫃上一擠著幾批的人。批發處軋滿了帶管學校中庶條事項的男女教帥，在忙著配書。熱鬧的情形，是平時所難得看見了。</p>
<p>商務的店堂里，陳設兒童書籍的地方，擠滿了小朋友們，在看書；中華，另外放有一張長桌子，擠滿了中小學教科書，好多人坐在桌上，默默的閱讀，有的更在作剳記，大概是敎師們在選擇敎科書：世界，選出了好多應用的廉價書籍，疊得寳塔樣高。這幾家書店，在開學期內，就是營業時間，也每是會放長的。</p>
<p>幾家出售文具的，儀器的商店，櫥窗裏也陳設一新，把各種文其，體育用品，溜冰鞋，很整潔的堆置着。也有裝着霓紅燈的廣吿或畫幾幅水彩畫，以引顧客的注目，內中有一家，更繪着兩幅「白雪公主」的巨畫放在橱窗之中。</p>
<p>不但新書店是這樣，舊書攤也在活躍起來，這幾天，文文街上的舊書攤一，新的又多擺了幾個，舊的書也添了不少木箱，書架，書也比前幾天多，所有應用的學校書籍，都分門別類的陳列著。第一個舊書攤上，有著幾個男女在淘舊書，無疑，舊書攤的活躍，無非是新書店的競敵呀！</p>
<p>在望平街口，四馬路上的幾家雜誌公司裹面，翻看圖畫難誌的人也格外擠軋。想必這幾天還在寒假之中，上文化街去閒蕩的人，走過雜誌公司，每個會順便進去望望。但當你走進去時，門口會有煙容滿面的人，問你「春宮要哇？」「小照要哇？」使你感到莫名的厭惡。</p>
<p>一切的一切，是反正文化街上，在寒假將要終舉的當兒，呈現了一種靜後之動呢！</p>

<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>金小姐：「我知道的！這是社會的根本沒有改造，無可强求的。譬如說：嚮導員三個字，名詞是己經壞了，人家聽得了嚮導員這個名詞，便要推想到這是個卑汚的職業了。但是到了民風高尙一點，再沒有人開了旅館，徵召嚮導員，以爲取樂之資。那末嚮導員名詞的壞，一大半也是那時的社會使它墮落，造成它這個壞處。試問現在還有那種卑汚的職業嗎？當時國民外交委員會中，也以爲這嚮導員的名兒不好聽，有人提出擬改別一種名兒。我那時就說：「不耍緊！果然有人開了旅館，或者在舞傷餐館，打電話來喊嚮導員的，我就去。我至少也可以向那班不良少年以及不良老年，勸說一番，把他們嚮導到善良的路上去呢。」一我這話說得他們大家都笑了。那未嚮導員三字並不壞，又何必改呢？』何雙玉道：『澹雲姊道話眞痛快！社會的基礎不立好，什麼都會變壞的。人家說：橘踰淮而成枳，爲什麼橘會成枳呢？就是踰淮以後，它的士壤不合官於種橘，所以要變種了。這倒不用去說它！原本總是想學好樣，只是來了就變壞了。還有的，在歐美也並不是好樣，中國却樣樣都有，最多的是屬於娛樂，賭博等事，中國却全要學得。」何儷玉接着說道：『允其是我們女人的妝服，可以算得全倣效了歐美。有幾件是學得好的，像剪發，放乳，等等都是對的。但如穿高跟皮鞋，有何意思。中國為了女子纏足，算是婦女界歷史上一種汚點，常爲外人所恥笑。然而穿那種高跟鞋子，也未見得高明，使得兩脚也成爲畸形。那時中國的一般文明女人，差不多都穿高跟皮鞋，有幾位穿了平底鞋子，簡直是不能走路咧。其次像是燙頭髮，也是歌風東斬，不過歐美各國，是有各種顏色不同的頭髮，她們官乎作鬈曲形。也有的她們的頭髮，是本來鬈曲的，也不必再去燙的，至多用梳子捲捲。然而像中國是東方人的頭髮，一例是黑而直的，但一時卻流行燙髮，要學得和歐美人一樣。有時自己很好的頭髮，燙得焦黃，這是什么意思。」（二六）</p>

<p>— 張家鳳</p>
<p>蕭伯納是世界上最反對把他的作品拍影片的一個人。他的劇本，如果搬上銀幕，一定會大大成功。所以二十</p>
<p>年來，英，美，法，德各國製片公司，都想盡方法，要勝買他的小說或劇本的製片權。每决次製片商去要求他時，他總是巧妙地回答他們說：『每個劇本的製片橘樹權費一百萬鎊。只有你們攝製給聲啞看的影片，我的劇本才賣給你』。或者說。『我片中的主角要魯易。佐治（譯者按係英國當代大政治家）扮演才行。』</p>
<p>每次製片商請求准許攝製他的作品時，蕭伯納總是冷笑地說：『我是够出名了，不需要任何影片來增加我的光榮。我是够富足了，不需要你們的錢。所以我爲什麽要把我的作品費給製片商呢？他們也許會糟塌他們，給我不必要的煩惱』</p>
<p>一個一個製片商都這樣碰壁，不想再在他身上打什麼主。這個特權，後來却讓一個比較不出名的製片商獲得，一切有名的公司反而失敗。葛白利·巴斯葛，雖然這是一個法國人的名字，他是生在匈牙利的。他是一個新聞記者，說明書撰述人，小說家及製片人，他早在好萊塢，倫敦，柏林，維也納，羅馬及布達佩斯許多製片公司工作了不少時間，</p>
<p>最近他在巴黎，囊中不名一分，他忽發奇想，寫了一封信給兩三年前會在亞得里亞海灘見過一面的蕭伯納求助。他那封信的大意是：</p>
<p>『先生，也許你仍舊記得我，我們在意大利，曾經敘談過一次（實際上叙談過十五分鐘）。也許你還記得，我現在是一個製片商。我老是對於你的著作感覺興趣，我極希望把你著的一個劇本，尤其是「Pygmaljon」，製成影片。在什麼條件之下，你賜給我這個特權呢？至少，你隨便給我一種吧！』</p>
<p>眞奇怪，蕭伯納眞還記得這個匈牙利人，並且一反他平時的習慣，還給了他一封回信，這一次他不像先前一樣，老是說些令人失望的話。他指示他（巴斯噶）去找他的帳房先生，「這是個頂講理的人，他現在荷蘭旅行，他吿訴他（帳房先生）在路特迍的通信處。</p>
<p>『我唯一的機會是我自己到路特迍去！』巴斯葛對他在巴黎的唯一的朋友說，並且把蕭伯納的回信給他看。如果你能够借一千法郞給我，我在一星期內可以取得「Pygmaljon」的攝製權』。</p>

<p>陳查禮回國第二探案開場？</p>
<p>名導演徐欣夫君，頻年專力偵探作品，早就目成一派。諸如一翡翠馬」「金鋼鑽」「生龍活虎一以至最近映過的「珍珠衫」等片，都曾有其較多貢獻，獲得相當的成功。而那一個被譽爲「偵探片權威導演的榮稱，因亦當之無愧，確可說是獨步一時的了！昨天，這位債探片導演，竟在偶然間「親自登塲」！演出了一幕趣劇，那情形眞像一部偵探戰在展幕開塲。</p>
<p>當天「該有事」！徐導演爲他一部自備汽車，突吿損壊，自已帶着許多零件，和一個備用車胎，急忽忽的坐在黃包車上，忙着趕上某車行去，用備速爲修理。不意進車子行經汕頭路那裏，他所戴着那頂新的呢帽，突然不翼而飛，和他頭部脫離關係。當下很迅捷的回頭看時，只見有位短衣人一手將去，快步如飛的奔進一處狹衖之中。他爲有着重量不小的汽車另件壓在腿上，一時不便下車，也就只能在黃包車夫快步進行曲中「目送飛鴻」，付之一笑。</p>
<p>上海人的俗話，這呌做「拋頂宮」。徐導演這番損失，雖屬有限，但也未嘗不是一個很趣妙的偵探術實騐機會。至於今後案情怎樣發展，是吾眞會策動他的「陳査禮」在「珍珠袗」之後，來辦這一件「回國第二探案」暫時未見有何動靜，還得等待事質分解。</p>
<p>此外徐導演原在公共租界華人特別警務團供職，亦即是位輪班上差的純義務的特別巡捕。「馬路英雄」胆敢在「老虎頭上撲蒼蠅」；那也是很發噱的一個笑話。</p>

<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>「西線活地獄」這片子，滬上各影院早經歷映甚久，這幾天在浙江大戲院開映，運日售座之盛，且又更較以前爲甚。它們爲了日夜四塲，連映不停的關係，當在院內觀衆未及退出之前，外面便早擁擠不堪，常如銀行擠兌一般情形。因此在前天下午，曾一度發生浙江路交通阻斷，及經探捕多人，到塲彈壓，方得維持秩序，歸於平靖，這樣熱烈情况的最大原因。實際上也正是民衆擁護抗戰的另一種的表現。因爲「西綫活地獄」內容，是演述一九一六年德法兩軍苦戰九閱月，死傷數十萬，法軍在連失名城之後，卒經力抗强敵，獲得最後勝利的壯烈故事；而很使人們看了都覺大快人心的。國產片在現環境下，勢難有其刺戟性的表演，大家爲有借酒澆愁，</p>
<p>一快胸襟的需要，便都不期然的對於這類影片更多特殊好感了！</p>

<p>四種舞女　各有千秋</p>
<p>上海劇藝社行將公演的「花濺淚」，是于伶繼「女子公寓」後的傑作，該劇較「女子公寓」更多噱頭，是一齣舞女的悲劇。特請電影名導演吳永剛負責導演。</p>
<p>本劇所描寫的：</p>
<p>第一種舞女所謂「紅舞女」，舞塲裏風頭甚健，台型紮足，身穿灰背大衣，舞票二百三百，可是誰知道她背後擺着個只認法幣不要面孔的「乾嫣弄得「紅舞女」身體不自由，行動不自由，連戀愛都不自由。</p>
<p>第二種舞女　所謂紅得不透的舞女，在舞塲裏馬馬虎虎，也還有噱頭，但是她們旣要「面子」，又要「夾裏」，雖然是自已飽經風霜，主意擺定，但是爲了塲面，爲了生活，就不得不「敷衍」「勉强」「苟且」「將就一，於是在精神上，受到極大的痛苦。</p>
<p>第三種舞女　所謂「十三點」，舞塲裏流行着的「電話聽筒」，他們自己糊裏糊塗，舞客對於這些是專吃豆腐，可是她們並不在乎，常常「弗耍擺勒心浪」，於是一次二次……無數次的被欺騙，被侮辱，等到眞眞不得了的時候，便發出神經病來了，但是有誰可憐她們呢！</p>
<p>第四種舞女　所謂「包身工舞女一，她們像包身工似的被人剝削着，小鳥似的被人玩弄着，一方面遭受老板或本家的惡罵和毒打，另一面只能忍氣吞聲地受主顧們的玩弄，這些人只知道弄舞票交賬，憧憬着一個結婚的美夢，可是這個夢始終給黑暗的勢力破壊了。</p>

<p>台上唱寄子台下哭兄弟</p>
<p>俗語說要想生氣，賭錢看戲，一猛然一聽，好像這句話講不通似的。因為三歲的孩子也知道擲骰子看戲，全是娛樂開心的事，怎麼我偏說要想生氣，才去賭錢看戲呢。其實待我把裹邊的意想解說明白啦，那眞是冉通沒有的了。先說賭錢，無論你賭的是麻將牌九，倘若你老是抓不進張，或是被上家攔成，再不然就是對天碰見至尊，像遇到這樣情形的時候，試問你氣是不氣？至於看戲，要是看到岳少保被害風波亭，曹孟德鳩殺二皇子的當兒，再問你氣是不氣？往往人家拿橘皮茶碗去砸阿瞞，還有一個皮匠師那兩句話，就能就它沒有道理了吧。</p>
<p>會作戲的不光是能敎你氣，並且還能敎你哭，有一次老譚演「桑園寄子，」忽見台下一人伏案大哭，那種悲痛的情形，眞正如喪考妣一般。有好事的人將他拉在一邊問他是不是犯了神經病？他立時頓足道：先生你這是甚麼話？我這種哭是聽了譚老板的戲，觸動我的心思，發現我的天良，不得不由的一種愧悔無及的眞哭，而且我現在還要立刻回家，把我兄弟找回，並要對他痛痛快快的一哭，別人見他說的隠隠約約不大明白，因再三追問道：倒底老兄是為了聽了女人的話，欺負我胞弟年幼，把上好的家產全都吞佔，將些不甚值錢的房產物件，硬行分給了他。他心中當然忿恨，剛同我反抗了幾句，我馬上拿出長兄的勞頭，把他趕了出去。原因為生了氣，想聽戲解悶，誰想譚老板的一唱一作，都能把弟兄友愛的眞情表現出來，我坐在下邊看了聽了，實在如芒刺在背，一刻一秒全不安了。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) No major battles are currently taking place on any fronts, though there are intense local engagements. One military expert speculates that a second large-scale decisive battle between Chinese and Japanese forces is unlikely to occur in the short term. The Japanese military, seemingly aware of their rash missteps, appear to be shifting their operational plans. Despite repeated failed attacks by the Japanese forces in Pu, both sides have suffered considerable casualties. However, the Chinese forces have maintained their position as the main force controlling the overall situation. Furthermore, guerrilla tactics are being employed at all times to harass and contain the enemy. At present, small-scale battles frequently occur along the Zhongtiao Mountain and Datong-Puzhou Railway line, with continuous artillery duels along the river. Chinese infantry and artillery are deployed along the river defense, with fortified positions. Japanese forces in Guangdong Province are reportedly planning a combined sea, land, and air offensive, and the Chinese military is on high alert. (Special dispatch, 8:00 PM on the 29th)</p>

<p>Yuanqu: The retreating Japanese forces in southern Shanxi have recently shown signs of renewed activity, clinging to the delusion of wiping out Chinese strength in the triangular area. They are currently advancing on four fronts: one route from Shijingchi and Zhuyang Village attacking Jie County, another from Yuxiang advancing south towards Ruicheng, a third from Liuguan Village attacking Jiangkou Village to the east, and the last after occupying Hua's Daxiaoxijiao area is now continuing to advance eastward. Chinese forces are engaging the enemy head-on on all fronts, with intense fighting occurring. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman recently told reporters that Japanese forces in southwestern Shanxi have launched three general offensives against Chinese positions in Zhongtiao Mountain in the past ten days, all of which have resulted in failure, with casualties reaching over 7,000. Japanese forces in eastern Shanxi have launched offensives against Hes順, Liaoxian, and other locations in eastern Shanxi since the 24th of this month, and Chinese forces are intercepting them on multiple fronts. According to the spokesman, the Japanese forces' current offensive in the southwest of Shanxi aims to "pacify" the Chinese forces in the mountains of southwestern Shanxi to avoid any worries when crossing the river to attack Shaanxi. Although this attempt by the Japanese military has failed, their ambition to invade Shaanxi Province has not waned. They are currently transferring reinforcements from the Pinghan and Zhengtai railway lines in an attempt to achieve their goal. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Guilin dispatch: The number of Japanese troops in Sanshui is increasing daily, with over 5,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, planning to attack Sihui. At the same time, Japanese warships in South China have been ordered to assemble in Tokyo Bay, suggesting a plan to attack Beihai. (Special dispatch, 12:00 PM on the 29th)</p>

<p>Sihui: At around 8:00 AM on the 28th, four Japanese rubber boats were spotted near Laoyazhou in Sanshui, maneuvering back and forth, with the intention of landing at an opportune moment. The Chinese garrison is on high alert, and the Japanese military has not dared to attack. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Over 30 Japanese warships are concentrated in Qingdao, and 20,000 Japanese troops have begun to be transported south. Some have already arrived in Sanshui. There are currently over 4,000 Japanese troops at the Sanshui estuary. It is also reported that Japanese General Matsui has arrived in Sanshui. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Japanese military activity in the Guozhou Island area is very tense. The following information was obtained yesterday: (1) The Japanese military has transported a large quantity of food and military supplies, including a transport vehicle and 2,000 pieces of engineering equipment. (2) The Japanese military has built an airfield near the Catholic Church on the island. It is reported that the Japanese military initially planned to land near Beihai or along the coast of Shankou to invade Qinlian. Now, they plan to attack Fangcheng and Dongxing by sea.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to unverified reports from the Guangzhou Bay area, the Japanese Navy has completed landing operations in Anpu on the Leizhou Peninsula. Anpu is located 60 miles east of Beihai and 30 miles west of Guangzhou Bay. Clear sounds of gunfire and bombing can now be heard in the Guangzhou Bay area.

<p>Shaanzhou: Approximately 1,000 Japanese troops invading south from Bo'ai have advanced eastward along the northern bank of the Qin River. They were intercepted by Chinese forces in the Guanzhuang area, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the day. Over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese forces then split into groups and fled eastward through Lanxie Bridge, Yuanhezhuang, and Dayuan Village. Chinese forces are currently pursuing them. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Shaanzhou: Recently, 400-500 Japanese troops have been added to Daokou Town in Jun County, and 6,000-7,000 Japanese troops have been added to Ji County. The Japanese forces in the Zhan Dian, Ma Ying, and He Ying areas were occupied successively after a joint attack by Chinese infantry and cavalry. Later, the Japanese forces launched a full-scale counterattack, and a certain unit engaged them, resulting in even more intense fighting. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle. The Japanese forces were unable to withstand the attack and mostly retreated to Xiao Xinxiang. Currently, 400-500 remaining Japanese troops in Zhan Dian are being besieged by Chinese forces. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Dali: Approximately 2,000 Japanese troops northeast of the city have been engaged in intense artillery battles with a certain Chinese unit for days. The Japanese troops invading east are currently in contact with a certain Chinese unit. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<p>Wanjiafu: Chinese forces on the Xiu River front launched a second determined full-scale raid on the morning of the 28th. At dawn on the 28th, all routes reached the north bank of the Xiu River and advanced to Yongxiu Park, Qijin, Qingshan, Liuzhuang, and Baicha. The Japanese forces, having been subjected to repeated attacks by Chinese guerrillas, were heavily guarded. However, brave Chinese units eventually entered the Japanese positions and engaged the Japanese forces in hand-to-hand combat. At the same time, the Japanese forces fired intense artillery fire at the southern bank of the Chinese side, and the Chinese artillery also returned fire, resulting in a very fierce artillery battle. The fighting north of the Xiu River began to subside from dawn on the 28th to the morning of the 29th. In addition to capturing and killing many Japanese soldiers, a certain unit also went behind Japanese lines, launching continuous attacks on the Japanese forces. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>Wanjiafu: After being repelled by Chinese forces, the remnants of the Japanese forces that invaded Keleyuan fled to Zhangjiapu, Moshigang, and Longgang. Currently, the Hua 口口 Division is attacking Longgang. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<p>Changde: A telephone dispatch from Shashi reports that the war in central Hubei and on the Jingshan-Zaoshi line has stabilized due to the Chinese forces' lightning strikes and clever offensives. Although the Japanese forces recently sent troops from Yingcheng to reinforce, they were repeatedly dealt heavy blows, and their morale has been sapped. They are currently facing the Chinese forces in the area east of Jingshan. Japanese troops invading into the Tianmen County are still engaged in intense fighting with Chinese troops in the northern territory of Tianmen County.

<p>Miluo: Chinese guerrilla units in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border areas have repeatedly reported victories since the evening of New Year's Day this year. According to reports today: (1) A certain unit destroyed two railway bridges at Pingshuipu near Puqi, and Japanese trains traveling between Wuhan and Yueyang have been suspended. (2) On the evening of the 27th, another unit killed over 20 Japanese soldiers between Tongcheng and Chongyang. In order to prevent the Japanese military from harming residents, Chinese guerrilla units all left the four characters "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" after completing their missions. However, the Japanese military still vented their anger on innocent Chinese civilians, committing acts of rape, plunder, and murder in the Tongcheng area for days, doing everything imaginable. They even burned down two to three thousand houses near the incident site, resulting in the desolation of dozens of miles, and their brutality is unprecedented and unseen in the human world. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) The reporter recently went to the Longmen Factory front on the right flank of the Jiuling Mountains for an on-site inspection and obtained a very good impression. Along the way, I saw troops strengthening fortifications and actively training in the severe cold, all with high spirits. Farmers are still engaged in farming, with the same level of intensity as usual. The businesses in the towns of Xianzhang, Jiayi, and Changshou are even more prosperous than in the past. The people are assisting the army in transporting supplies, fully demonstrating the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. This is indeed a major advancement in the second phase of the war of resistance. Longmen Factory is located on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, a crucial pass through Pingjiang, Tongxiushui, and Tongcheng. Mount Mufu stands tall in the northwest, and Dongyang stretches across the southeast, with towering mountains serving as a barrier. Moreover, the people are heroic and are currently launching a large-scale movement to defend their homeland, cooperating with the regular army in counterattacks. If the Japanese military wants to bypass the natural defenses of the Jiuling Mountains and attempt to make inroads into this area, they will undoubtedly be defeated. (Dispatch from the 29th)</p>

He turned the tables, leading the Japanese forces into an area controlled by Chinese forces. After the Japanese forces discovered this, they killed He. After receiving the report, the provincial government believed that He Yezhong deeply understood the greater good and sacrificed for the country, and specially awarded him a pension of 100 yuan to show commendation and encouragement.

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Japanese side's claim that Wu Peifu has agreed to lead a national salvation and peace movement, Wu has not yet issued any written statement to confirm this. Since the failure of Wang Jingwei's peace movement, Wu Peifu has been under great pressure from the Japanese side. After receiving the request to lead this movement, Wu issued an article generally discussing the history of the current war, regretting the hostile behavior between China and Japan, and saying that if the war does not end, then once a great fire breaks out, China may be turned into ashes, and it will also be unfavorable to Japan. Diplomatic circles here believe that the wording of this article is extremely appropriate. In an extremely difficult environment, he had no choice but to make this unconstrained statement. What is even more noteworthy is that Wu did not make any attacks on the Kuomintang regime or Chairman Chiang. It is heard that Wu has recently had some contact with Chiang.

<p>(Chongqing) Although 54 universities, technical schools, libraries, and 140 other institutions have been destroyed in China due to the war, a new education system is being built in the interior to train China's future citizens and leaders. The Sino-Japanese War has not only brought about great political and industrial reforms in China, but also great cultural changes. According to this decision, China has 180 important cultural institutions and 122 universities and specialized schools that have been destroyed or fallen into Japanese-occupied areas. In addition, of the 3,330 middle schools, 1,407 have been destroyed. Of the 2,912 public and private libraries, 1,436 have been destroyed. As for the percentage of students who have dropped out of school, the percentage of university students is 71.2%, middle school students is 43.1%, and primary school students is 49.3%. It is certain that 30 universities have been completely destroyed due to the war. The loss suffered by cultural institutions is estimated at 217,401,743 yuan. The current educational policies in China are: (1) Establishing teachers' colleges as the first step to improving the curriculum of normal schools. (2) Major educational projects to support the war of resistance. (3) Promoting technical education. Therefore, the bombing and destruction of major middle schools in China is by no means a fatal blow to the Chinese education sector. China has now mobilized all of its well-known educators to work hard and create a bright new education system. (Associated Press dispatch from the 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Prospects of the World Crisis <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The recent state and trend of Europe can be said to have reached a point where war is inevitable. War is not an unexpected change; it is only by rare good fortune that it can be avoided. The fuse has been lit, and the explosion is imminent. Those who say that it can still be contained must rely on extraordinary means to have any chance of hope, but extraordinary means cannot be guaranteed. There are many who have said this, and the return of the American ambassadors to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy two decades ago to report on their duties particularly emphasized it. In the last two decades, the trend has become even more obvious. The capture of Barcelona by the Spanish Nationalist forces, with the Republican government forces appearing unable to continue fighting, such a rapid turn of events can be seen as the final moment after the fuse has been lit. From this day, this time, this situation, this scene, until the outbreak of war, it only requires the Nationalist forces to take advantage of the momentum and advance further, as the Italian masses advocated, "Charge directly into France," then war will come. From this day, this time, this situation, this scene, until the elimination of the disaster of war, it depends on the Italian soldiers in the Nationalist forces reining in their horses at the edge of the cliff, as Italian Prime Minister Mussolini guaranteed, "Withdraw from the western border," then peace can be maintained. The two different trends are both in the hands of Mr. Mussolini. According to its essence, it is not that withdrawing troops is more difficult than attacking, but in recent times, what has been expressed by the Italian government and public has all targeted France. Italy does not fail to say that Italy's wishes are based on facts and justice, and that it has nothing to do with the Spanish Civil War. However, who will believe that Italy will seek to realize its wishes after withdrawing its volunteer soldiers from Spain? If the Italian troops are not withdrawn, then in the northeast, Germany; in the southeast, Italy; in the southwest, Spain. Those surrounding France are all enemies on three sides, not only separated from Annam by Shao, but also separated from its African territories. Moreover, overseas in Annam, there are already Japanese naval and air forces, preparing to land in Beihai, China, echoing and watching Annam with the full-fledged countries of Europe. With Italy's layout like this, and its wishes like that, will it be abandoned for now and re-planned for another day? Will France hand over its territory as compensation for Italy's wishes?</p>
<p>If the situation and trends of France and Italy are like this, what about other countries? Examining what Germany and Italy are plotting, the strategy of defeating them individually is at the center, with France being the first target to be defeated. This is not only evidenced by the public opinion created by Germany and Italy, but their diplomatic activities are also clearly visible. In terms of diplomacy: towards Britain, they strive to alienate British-French relations; towards the Soviet Union, they claim that what the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is defending against is Germany, not Italy. Therefore, Germany has a joint declaration with France on December 6, and engages in superficial dealings with Soviet commercial officials to offset the seriousness of the Franco-Soviet Pact, leaving the responsibility for putting pressure on France to Italy alone; towards the Central European countries, after subduing Czechoslovakia, they use all means of appeasement towards Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania. The significance of this is to divide the satellites of the Soviet Union and France in order to isolate the friction between the Soviet Union and Germany, and to trap France in isolation so that Germany and Italy can have no worries in the Mediterranean once something happens. If this were to completely fulfill Germany and Italy's plans, then Italy would begin to think that skinning and eating France is as easy as lifting a hand, or even without bloodshed.</p>
<p>However, France is not Czechoslovakia. The French army has a great reputation, its navy is undoubtedly superior to Italy, and its history, culture, and nation have their own ways to maintain the honor of the country. Kneeling to foreign humiliation and waiting to be slaughtered is seen in Czechoslovakia, but not in France. Moreover, diplomacy, which is skillful and complex, is based on shared interests and harm. The recent lesson is not far away: Czechoslovakia did not receive foreign aid from the Franco-Czech agreement, and eventually it was divided up like melons and beans. How can the Central European countries not follow suit when Germany and Italy threaten and lure them? However, to say that Germany and Italy's appeasement of the Central European countries has created an iron wall in the rear is to believe in diplomacy and ignore the interests of all. Once there is a war, the lines between friends and enemies will need to be re-aligned. Therefore, under the strategy of individual defeat: although it is considered the ultimate goal to subdue France without a fight, France will inevitably fight back; although the wish is that the dispute will not go beyond the scope of France and Italy, Central Europe is unpredictable. As for the attitude of the great powers such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it has long been seen through and despised by the aggressor nations, as they only wish to be virtuous alone and to share the blessings. Over the past seven or eight years, all major international changes have originated from this. Until recently, the aggressor nations have been pressing closer and closer, forcing the great powers to recognize the aggressors' faces as ferocious, and to recognize their ambitions as insatiable. Thus, they have shown the people that they are gradually learning to cheer up. If France and Italy meet each other with weapons, the great powers will probably no longer stand by. Therefore, it is said that the day France and Italy clash will be the beginning of the Second World War, and this is its eve. The only hope is that the great powers will step forward and boldly express that the democratic countries will share the difficulties together; or even go a step further and individually defeat the aggressor groups, then peace may be hoped for.</p>

<p>Organizing Reclamation and Industrial Companies for Large-Scale Economic Construction</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Economic circles and authorities recently established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee, allocating 20 million yuan to implement various development plans. Currently, among the groups investing in national construction are the Hua Xi Reclamation Company, organized by Huang Xiu Feng and others, with a capital of 5 million yuan, actively proceeding; Liu Wenhui's Da Hua Industrial Company, with a capital of 10 million yuan, specializing in developing the resource-rich areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang; Hu Wenhu's decision to invest 30 million yuan to develop Yunnan Province's resources. Other entities, such as the National Official Merchant Bank and various foreign merchants from Britain and the United States, are also very active in investing in Southwest construction. China, Communications, and other banks have also decided to jointly establish a large-scale cotton mill in Kunming with the Fudian New Bank, raising funds with a planned capacity of 25,000 spindles. A preparatory committee has already been established, with Song Ziwen and Qian Xinzhi planning in Hong Kong. According to Zheng Tieru, the Hong Kong branch manager of the Bank of China, the mill's organization will be finalized soon. It is also learned that the four major banks, namely the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, have established 70 branches in the Northwest, Sichuan, and Xikang regions to promote development work.

<p>(Chongqing) According to Hua Fang news, Xikang's gold production has long been well-known. Recently, the central government and local authorities jointly established a gold mining bureau, appointing Lin Yun, former president of Shandong University, as the director to carry out all activities. To gain insight into the actual situation of gold production in Xikang, the reporter specially requested Dr. Li Chunyu, who has surveyed the geology of Sichuan and Xikang, to give his views. Dr. Li first stated that gold is produced everywhere in Xikang, especially in Daofu and Zhanhua. Guangduo of Zhanhua conducted extensive investigations in the Maike River area. The saying "walking on straw sandals over land filled with gold," although an exaggeration, is indeed quite rich. Because the geology of Xikang belongs to metamorphic rock, there are very thin quartz veins containing a lot of gold. Through natural forces, the quartz is broken, and the gold flows into the gravel. Its distribution in the water has less in the main streams and more in the tributaries. The amount of gold produced is still difficult to estimate, but the amount of gold produced is directly proportional to the number of workers. If the local situation can be eased and food can be supplied, the future of gold panning is very promising, he said. (Quick News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The European edition of the New York People's Forum recently published a telegram from the East, stating that it is widely rumored here that General Oshima, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, and Shiratori Toshio, the ambassador to Italy, have been conducting important talks with the authorities of their respective host countries for several days. The discussions revolve around strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact. Originally, the clauses of this pact were only for the prevention of the spread of communism. Now, it is proposed to amend it into a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. While this matter is related to the current duties of the two ambassadors, Oshima also participated in the past when the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed, so the relationship is very close. It is heard that after discussions in Sanremo, Italy, the two ambassadors submitted their results to the meeting of Japanese ambassadors to European countries held in Paris on the 27th of this month. Subsequently, a conference will be convened in Berlin or Rome to continue the discussions. The Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, and the ambassador to Poland, Sakoh, will also participate at that time. The Kokumin Shimbun, the Japanese military's official newspaper in Tokyo, stated that Ambassador Oshima will conduct important negotiations with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in the coming days to lay the cornerstone of the new world order.

<h3 id="e27">The Vanguard of the Guangzhou Labor Training Class <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Zhong</p>
<p>The 300,000 workers of Guangzhou are already organized and valiantly undertaking combat duties in the War of Resistance. After the fall of Guangzhou, thirty vanguard warriors marched into the mountains, preparing to launch extensive guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>One month after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, workers in Guangzhou's oil pressing, printing, machinery, electrical, and construction industries, as well as rickshaw pullers and coolies, began to pay attention to its organization. A young worker—Chen Lizhou—first felt the necessity of organizing, and in his life of hardship, he already felt that workers must unite, especially under the brutal and crazed invasion. Similarly, every worker in Guangzhou saw that the enemy's brutal attacks would soon be directed at them, so they consciously rose up to organize, overcame many difficulties, and finally established a labor training class.</p>
<p>Young workers came in batches to receive training. After intensive training for one month per term for four months, the comrades of the labor training class numbered more than 3,000. Their strength was considerable! More than 3,000 new warriors played a huge role in promoting the cause among the workers of Guangzhou and even the entire Guangdong! Patriotic enthusiasm filled every factory and workshop, and the work of national salvation influenced farmers, merchants, and other groups.</p>
<p>The labor training class is a group supported by all 300,000 workers in Guangzhou, and it is most capable of approaching the masses of workers because they have friendly relations and the same vital interests. Therefore, the connection and unity are tighter than any professional group.</p>
<p>The "Classmates Association" is a major driving force for them to mobilize the masses to participate in the anti-Japanese movement. In the past three months, nearly 100,000 people have joined. Groups of farmers, workers, peddlers, boatmen... all came to join. Under the difficult conditions of the "class" lacking funds and unable to promote the work, the workers themselves took out their hard-earned money to buy books, newspapers, and paper. From the tireless work of the whole day, they took the time to sing, perform plays, and regularly publish street wall newspapers, gathering many friends to read books and newspapers and discuss current affairs.</p>
<p>When the news that the mother of guerrillas—Old Lady Zhao—arrived in Guangzhou, it spread to the "Labor Training Class," so there was a "Labor Welcome Team" that went to the station to greet her in a heavy rain. Shouts of "Long live China!" "Long live the mother of guerrillas!" "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!" rang out. The old work clothes were soaked through the old shirts, and the rainwater flowing through the dirty skin smelled bad. A brocade banner was held high in the procession and handed to Old Lady Zhao amid enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>On Double Tenth Day, the national donation movement was surging. The Guangzhou workers, who usually had nothing to spare, also searched their pockets for the few copper coins they had. Every comrade who participated in the wall newspapers, singing, transportation, and stretcher bearing ran to the rural villages to find the friends they knew to participate in the donation, and as a result, they collected a total of 2,186 yuan! This is the accumulation of every penny from tens of millions of workers, and this number shows the workers' loyalty and love for the motherland.</p>
<p>On November 17, 30,000 young workers and students held a singing parade in Guangzhou. On the 21st, the citizens of Guangzhou retreated in a unprepared panic. Groups of labor salvation workers destroyed important factories and workshops and then mostly left the city because the labor comrades who were unwilling to be slaves of the subjugated nation were not used by the enemy.</p>
<p>The "Labor Cadres" armed with copper helmets and straw sandals, holding rifles and hand grenades, marched on the Guangzhou-Huaxian Road. The raging flames destroyed almost all of Guangzhou. More than 30 enemy planes swept over the city and dropped heavy bombs. The worker cadres bravely broke out of the encirclement and arrived at Jiahexu. The number of people was reduced by a part, and the remaining total was 113.</p>
<p>"Reorganize our ranks"! One hundred and thirteen people lined up in an iron row, turned west at Jiahexu to Guanyao Lubao, and traveled north along the river to Qingyuan at night. For three days and three nights, they were hungry and wearing single clothes. More than ten comrades who were sick dragged behind the team and went to a village to rest. That was "Shahexu," a small town of more than 100 households. The people thought it was a disturbing army and ran away. Nothing could be bought in the village. The workers still all stayed and began to do mass work. First, they approached the many fleeing people and helped them maintain law and order, cut wood, thresh rice, carry grain, and carry water. After three days, the number of people in the market increased, and prices immediately fell.</p>
<p>They discovered a huge force: more than 300 guns for self-defense in more than 100 households! Strong men carried guns and asked to fight guerrilla warfare. The high morale of the masses had reached its peak. This was a great opportunity for the comrades to organize through propaganda. People were talking individually in the corners of the village. After some propaganda, the villagers had a clear understanding of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, and more villagers asked to join the organization of "Labor Cadres."</p>
<p>The comrades only got one meal of white rice a day. In the situation of meager economy, they could not take all the villagers away. However, they could still maintain contact between the two. Most of the workers went to Qujiang to take on the transportation work of the military station's general supervisor, and a small part continued to do organizational work. The worker cadres are the center of their entire working masses. They decided to supplement some cadres in Qujiang, and at the same time, they selected 30 work cadres with higher cultural and political levels, resolute and brave, and able to fight independently, to go to the northern Guangdong area to mobilize the masses and prepare for future guerrilla warfare. These 30 cadres are the vanguard of the steel army. "Loyalty, courage, unity, perseverance, and struggle" are the team's training they share in northern Guangdong.</p>
<p>Iron will, iron discipline, iron torrent, we are the steel army, we go to the front line, our mission is to seek national liberation and strive for world peace. That kind of high-pitched rough voice roared out the songs they wrote themselves. In a heated atmosphere, 30 national warriors embarked on their journey.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Zhenjiang Pseudo-Organization Extensively Scavenges Merchants and People <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Forcibly Collecting Land Tax, Villagers Angrily Refuse to Pay; Several Pseudo-Soldiers Killed or Wounded During "Purge of the Countryside"</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The pseudo-organization in Zhenjiang has recently used its scavenging skills to forcibly collect land taxes from farmers in various rural areas. Because most farmers are unwilling to pay, the pseudo-county government has sent the connected ballots to the pseudo-autonomous associations in various districts to extort from households. Each mu (unit of land) is levied an exorbitant tax of about 6 jiao. If anyone refuses to pay, the pseudo-police or Japanese soldiers will go to the countryside to arrest and coerce them. The villagers cannot bear the harassment and automatically request nearby guerrillas to come and protect them. The pseudo-organization has also set up pseudo-tax collection offices and ticket inspection offices in various rural areas and at the four city gates to collect pseudo "goods tax." Merchants must declare the tax according to their "tax rules" for any goods entering, leaving, or being transported, and then go through the ticket inspection procedures along the way before they can reach their destination. The highest tax rate is 25%, and the lowest is 16%. However, when inspecting the tickets, merchants must also pay a considerable fee to the pseudo-officials. This is still within the so-called "Dantu County" area. If they want to export to neighboring counties, they have to change the road permit. The categories are not only abnormally complicated, but the expenses are also alarmingly high.</p>
<p>The market around Zhongzheng Road seems to have recovered on the surface. However, the various old goods stalls and cigarette paper stalls listed on the streets after the robbery have gradually closed down, and they have been replaced by eye-catching Japanese shops and restaurants that offer "special hospitality for women." As for ordinary shops, only 30% to 40% have resumed business. Therefore, there are still shops in the city that have been sealed by the Japanese Gendarmerie because no one has returned to do business. The pseudo-organization is now setting up a pseudo "Dantu County Chamber of Commerce" at the old site of the Iron Guild in front of the Stone Arch Bridge (this place was previously used as a comfort station). The position of pseudo-chairman has not yet been selected, but it has actively scavenged merchants and people. Merchants who resume business must register with the pseudo-association and pay various fees, including a registration fee of 5 jiao per household and a monthly fee ranging from 3 jiao, 6 jiao, 1 yuan, to 2 yuan per household. In addition, they must also pay a business license fee. According to the estimated capital, they have to pay a license fee of 1 yuan and 5 jiao for every 500 yuan, and so on in proportion. Merchants are pained by this kind of exploitation, so most of them have no intention of resuming business to avoid being extorted by the traitors in the pseudo-organization. The Japanese troops stationed in Zhenjiang are now the Guanglv troops, with four or five hundred people, stationed in the Five Great Halls, Boxian Ancestral Hall, Bank of China, and Railway Station. The Japanese Gendarmerie and Appeasement Squads are set up in the Central Bank. The Japanese soldiers are now forcing people to get vaccinated. When entering and leaving the city gates, they must show their "Good Citizen Certificate" and vaccination certificate. The previous first, second, and third phases of the epidemic prevention injection certificates have all been declared invalid. As for residents who travel outside and plan to take the train controlled by the Japanese army, they must first obtain a pass from the Japanese Appeasement Squad. The fee for obtaining the certificate is stipulated to be 5 jiao, but this pass cannot be obtained without a traitor from the pseudo-organization. Entrusting them to get it on their behalf will inevitably be extorted a black fee of 2 or 3 yuan per ticket. For example, if a resident has relatives and friends staying at home today, they must fill out an entry report at the ward chief, paying 2 fen per form. After the curfew at 10 pm, the Japanese army and pseudo-police knock on doors to check the household registration. If the number of people does not match, if there are more people, it can be accommodated, but if one person is missing, the whole family will be escorted to the "department" for interrogation. The reason is that the missing person at night must be out doing dangerous (guerrilla) work, so it must be thoroughly investigated, it is said.</p>
<p>Because their forces are weak, the Japanese side is currently garrisoning only the Zhencheng area and the two and four districts along the railway line. The other districts are all under the control of the guerrillas. The Japanese army only occasionally drives its enslaved pseudo-appeasement team to "purge the countryside" in various rural areas, but the guerrillas are elusive and give the other side a major blow from time to time. The Japanese and pseudo-troops travel back and forth, and the result is only to provide sacrifices. It is said that the pseudo-soldiers commanded by He Chunchao have suffered countless casualties recently. The people's armed forces in the rural areas are also being actively trained and gradually strengthened by the new county magistrate Zhuang, who was appointed by the government.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Chamberlain's Speech: Striving for International Understanding; Anglo-Italian Relations Are Good; Reasonable Demands Can Be Discussed; Strengthening National Defense Is for Self-Defense <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in his speech at the Birmingham Jewellers' Association last night that without progress in Anglo-Italian relations, he could not have obtained Mussolini's cooperation last September. The outside world has criticized the Munich Agreement and his intention to resolve the behavior that almost plunged the world into an unprecedented tragedy through personal contact. Although these criticisms came from all sides, they had one thing in common, that is, the critics did not bear the responsibility he had, and they did not know the various situations known only to the British government. Looking back, there is neither anything to regret nor any reason to believe that there is a more beneficial path. Modern warfare is extremely terrifying. Not only are those who participate in the war affected, but even those who watch from the sidelines suffer greatly. Therefore, if any honorable methods that are practicable can prevent war, we should not start a war without trying them one by one. The British government has held this view from the beginning. The Munich Agreement is only a casual event in a firm peace policy. He plans to do more than this. He dares to say that the reason why peace was maintained last September was because of the previous causes that had been planted before September, such as the exchange of letters between him and Mussolini in the summer of 1937, and the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement in February 1938. Recently, his trip to Rome with Foreign Secretary Halifax has been obstructed by people who do not want the safety, friendship, mutual understanding, and willingness to resolve disputes not by force but by discussion that the British and Italian people hold to be realized and criticized greatly. This is not only true in Britain and Italy, but also in France and Germany. We should create friendship between the people of all countries. This can be done by individuals and merchants, not only by official representatives. We should make the other party understand that we do not regard them as enemies, but as human beings just like us. We are always prepared to talk to them on an equal footing, listen to their opinions with an open mind, and meet their reasonable and appropriate desires as much as possible, and on the basis of freedom and justice, not to conflict with the rights of others. Only in this way can we dispel the doubts that poison the international atmosphere and restore the safety of mind and body, and the trust that is the lifeblood of successful undertakings. The achievement of peace requires at least two parties, while the making of war can be done by one party alone. This is what we must not forget. If we do not have a clear understanding to eliminate all kinds of political tensions, then we can only defend ourselves to prevent other countries from attacking our country, people, or the liberalism and democratic country on which survival depends, and which is the foundation of life and spirit. For the sake of self-defense and not aggression, we are now, with the full consent of the people, actively engaged in the reorganization of our military. This takes time, but progress in all aspects is now accelerating. Chamberlain then recounted the progress of the army, navy, and air force in the year before the end of March, saying that by the end of March, 60 new ships totaling 130,000 tons could be incorporated into the navy, and in the 12 months after that, even more new ships would be incorporated into the fleet, totaling 75 ships with 150,000 tons. The air force is also working hard to enrich it. In the past few months, the number of aircraft manufactured has doubled, and the recruitment of air force soldiers has also been successful. Most of the shortcomings found in the British air defense in September last year have now been eliminated. Air defense has been greatly improved, with more anti-aircraft guns and a more stringent air defense team. Chamberlain continued to elaborate on his views on the British National Voluntary Service, saying that if we are indeed caught up in the whirlpool of war, we will see that all the people of the country, even if they are not on the front lines, are practically all on the front lines. To cope with this danger, there is a new opportunity for civilians to serve in civil air defense agencies. We do not want to create a civil air defense team and enlist it in the army as a profession during wartime, thus exempting ordinary citizens from the responsibility of defending themselves. Our job is to find people for a certain job, not to find jobs for the people of the whole country. The government has to spend a lot of time and money to prepare for the war. It is hoped that today is a time to contribute to other countries, because today's atmosphere is full of rumors and doubts, which must not be allowed to exist for a long time. It is those who destroy peace who, as President Roosevelt said in his New Year's message, want to dominate the world by force, which must be rejected by democratic countries. He cannot believe that those who make this request have the intention of challenging, because the consequences of war are extremely serious and no government dares to try it easily. He still believes that any disputes can be resolved through negotiation and discussion, as stipulated in the Munich Declaration, without resorting to war. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>(London) With the unrest in Europe, the Dutch currency exchange rate has weakened greatly. At the same time, the amount of Dutch gold transshipped from London to the United States has also increased greatly. Today, about 7 million US dollars worth of gold bars were shipped to the United States by the "Aquitania". There are still seven batches waiting to be shipped, totaling approximately US$65,000,000, which are scheduled to leave the UK completely before February 25. It is said that the weakness of the Dutch currency and the outflow of Dutch gold are related to the dismissal of German Finance Minister Schacht and the rumors that Hitler is planning something. Today, the Dutch currency opened at 8.70 to one pound, and then fell to 8.715, breaking the lowest record since November last year. (Associated Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>140 US warships held large-scale exercises in the Caribbean Sea, which lasted for several days. The first phase of the exercise was to practice shooting, which will end on the 31st of this month. The second phase of the exercise is to defend the American continent, which is about to begin. A large number of warships are currently anchored in this port waiting for orders. According to this exercise, 5 battleships will cruise the coasts of South American countries, and many other warships will sail along the Atlantic coast to New York. At the same time, 80 bombers will take off from Puerto Rico and fly to the Panama Canal Zone to "attack" the canal, which will be defended by the sea and air forces there.

<p>(Paris) The local area expresses welcome for the speech given by British Prime Minister Chamberlain last night at the Birmingham Jewelers' Association, because Chamberlain's firm tone contains a gentle meaning. Therefore, everyone believes that it has the same intention as the speech given by French President Daladier in the House of Representatives recently. Because Chamberlain also wanted to repair relations with Italy and expressed his belief in the possibility of discussions between France and Germany. Moreover, one point coincides with Daladier: the necessity of combining the strength of defense with a firm position to seek peace. The saying in Chamberlain's speech that "Our motto is neither provocation nor obedience, but defense" can fully express the current responsibilities of major democratic countries. Local people also hope that Chamberlain's words that he is willing to ask Germany and Italy to make contributions to peace will be agreed by the other party, and Hitler and Mussolini will respond to it in their future speeches. As for the warning issued by Chamberlain at the end of his speech, saying that all democratic countries must unite to resist any attempt to organize the world by force, and cannot avoid it, the wording is extremely clear. (Reuters telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) People here believe that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham is an expression of Britain's firmer attitude to deal with future international factions. Various circles close to the US government believe that no matter what happens in the future, Chamberlain will always remain optimistic. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini just regarded the fall of Barcelona as a victory for Fascism. It is surprising that the British Prime Minister took this opportunity to swear by the Italian Prime Minister's words. Fascism has won in Spain, and it will threaten Britain and France in the Mediterranean, and France is even in danger of being oppressed by autocratic countries on three sides. The situation is like this, but Chamberlain still does not change his optimism, so everyone deeply hopes that his optimism is not without basis. (Reuters on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain yesterday in Birmingham, England, has been commented on and praised by American politicians. Everyone said that the principle put forward by President Roosevelt in his New Year's address to Congress, that the control of the entire world by violence must be resisted, seems to have been accepted by Prime Minister Chamberlain. Furthermore, Prime Minister Chamberlain's proposal that various democratic countries should unite is especially supported by the American people. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in his speech that the British arms expansion plan is now proceeding rapidly. This is regarded here as a warning directly aimed at various autocratic countries, and therefore everyone feels very satisfied. (Havas telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers have expressed sympathy for the speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday, especially emphasizing the section on the British cabinet minister's visit to Rome. Everyone said that this is an expression of peace. Prime Minister Chamberlain is full of realism and can use sincerity to help it, which can be described as rare and valuable. The Roman People's Daily stated that all governments say they want peace, including the French government. This is not a lie, but all the omnipotent countries believe that the conditions related to survival should be met, while other countries advocate maintaining the status quo. In other words, all the omnipotent countries want to establish peace based on justice, while other countries want to establish peace based on a very unfair status quo. This is the difference. (Havas telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) There are few German newspapers commenting on the speech made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday, but the words all express goodwill. The German General Journal stated, "Prime Minister Chamberlain knows that once a new type of war breaks out, the impact will be unimaginable. Green is to advocate achieving political goals through negotiations. As for his so-called various reasonable wishes, they must be met. We think this is worth considering." The local guide stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was a defense of the policy he was pursuing, but it is a pity that he did not reveal who was opposed to this policy.

<p>Bebeini When the border between France and Spain opened at eight o'clock this morning, Spanish refugees poured in. The number was more than before. Most of them had been running around hungry for several days. They looked haggard and pitiful. Then there were rumors that the National Army had landed in Losas Bay. The refugees outside the border were all startled birds and panicked. In fact, the landing statement was not accurate. Only a few National Army warships bombarded Balamos Port. As of now, the villages along the French border are full of refugees, and more are coming in an endless stream. Some even sneaked into the border without going through the border crossing. It was also heard that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Republican Government, Teldayu, had dispatched several teams of infantry to prevent deserters and government officials from crossing the border into France. In addition, 400 soldiers and civilians wounded by aircraft bombs in various hospitals in the Spanish Group of Girona Province were also transported to the French city of Serbor this morning by several trucks. The French authorities immediately set up a temporary hospital near the station to accommodate them. Various French public groups have set up shelters and provided generous supplies. Even for the refugees outside the border, they also used several trucks to load bread and utensils used by the army to provide food for relief. (Hass telegram on the 28th) Hong Gala There are a large number of refugees from various places in the Catalan Autonomous Region who are gathered here waiting for a train to go to France. All of them are women, children, the elderly, and the weak, carrying boxes and suitcases, looking very embarrassed. The border customs was originally scheduled to stop working at 9:00 p.m. every day, but due to the large number of refugees, they worked all night last night without a moment's rest. Most of the refugees had not eaten for two days, and their anxiety was beyond words. The roads to the French border were filled with cars and trucks, causing traffic jams. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republican Government has now temporarily moved to Girona City to work, and other departments have decided to move to Figueres City. As of now, except for the departments related to national defense, the rest have not been able to return to normal. (Havas telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Bebeignon The government recently instructed the border defense authorities on the border between France and Spain to prohibit strong men from Spain from seeking refuge in France, but women, children, the elderly and the weak are not subject to this restriction, because the strong men who remain in Spain can obtain supplies in certain places. As for the Spanish strong men who have entered France, they should be concentrated in certain shelters. (Havas telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Bebeignon The French Army authorities decided late last night that any Spanish men of military age who have crossed the border into France may stay in France, but no more will be allowed to enter France in the future. The French army received an order from the government at dusk yesterday that all Spanish men who crossed the border into France and were capable of military service would be sent back to Spain. When the order arrived, some refugees had boarded the train to wait for it to drive inland. The French mobile troops and border guards carried out this order. There were several times when they had to use force to force the refugees to get off the train and return to Spain, but many people tried their best to resist, saying that they would rather die in France than be captured by the National Army. After this order was issued, only Spanish women, children, the elderly and the weak will be allowed to enter France in the future. (Reuters telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>Bebeignon A group of Spanish government troops, a total of 1,500 officers and men, recently fled across the border into France near Moro today. According to the army's Memory Palace, he told the Havas reporter, "The enemy army has a majority of aircraft and is well-equipped, so our army cannot support it." A large number of Spanish refugees fled to France today in Morandani. Most of them are pale and hungry, exhausted, and many of them are pregnant women. As soon as they enter France, they moan by the roadside, and the situation is very miserable. The French local authorities sent many trucks to transport the refugees to the city of Blue. Many doctors and nurses have also gone to the city to provide treatment. (Havas telegram on the 28th)</p>

They were then dispersed by a large number of police and more than 300 people were arrested. Bi Faner, the leader of the "Socialist Workers' and Peasants' Party," was also among them and was immediately released. (Havas telegram on the 28th)</p>

Our country's relations with neighboring countries have improved, so the Thessaloniki Agreement has been established.

<h3 id="e38">A Very Important Eugenics Issue <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Physician, Graduated from the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>On the Pros and Cons of Removing the Gonads</p>
<p>We cannot deny that the current progress of science has indeed grasped the opportunity to improve the human race. For those militaristic countries, their research on eugenics is very active. They do not hesitate to use drastic measures and radical means to castrate citizens who cannot reproduce or have sexually transmitted diseases. In this way, all the people are strong and burly. In the future, can they be commanded as desired when charging into battle?</p>
<p>The advocate of this policy is Hitler in Germany. It is said that it has been quite successful. Any citizen who wants to marry must first go to a doctor designated by the state for a strict examination. If they are found to have venereal infectious diseases and their reproductive function cannot produce strong offspring, they will undergo surgery to remove their gonads.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the drawbacks of this policy when it is implemented, the German government specially formulated a radical law called the "Genetic Disease Abolition Law." It has been implemented for five years. According to this law, hundreds of special courts have been established throughout Germany, and their mission is to determine the punishment of removing the gonads. Unexpectedly, this almost peculiar law has been imitated by Japan today. Japanese parliamentarians also advocate the proposal to remove the gonads, but it was soon placed on a high shelf by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and it has been delayed for a long time. The Ministry of Health and Welfare adopted this wait-and-see policy because there are many drawbacks after its implementation. If it is handled too hastily, it will inevitably be criticized by the public. This is a major matter. If the organization is not good, not only will it not be thoroughly implemented, but it will greatly reduce the birth rate.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of experts from various countries, this law should have the necessity of choosing its urgency and importance. Those who suffer from severe venereal diseases should indeed have their gonads removed. If the health level is only low and the reproductive function is weak, animal youth gland (i.e., gonad) hormones can be used to supplement the human body, which can be fully cured. (Editor's note: Germany has now adopted this method, so removing the gonads is only applied to those who suffer from severe venereal diseases.)</p>
<p>The reason why energy is scattered and sexual function is weakened is entirely due to indulgence and masturbation, so the youth gland loses its prosperity, and symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence follow. If the prosperity of the youth gland can be restored at this time, the above-mentioned symptoms will disappear naturally, so why use the passive strategy of removing the gonads?</p>
<p>German medicine has always been developed and talents have emerged in large numbers. Therefore, the famous physiologist Dr. Merlen proposed chimpanzee testicle sperm and invented the true youth gland hormone, "Body Kang," for men and women. Anyone who suffers from reproductive failure and decreased libido will have the same spring from now on and will no longer have to go on the operating table. This is not only the luck of German citizens, but the gospel of all mankind.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Choosing the Right Medicine Should Be the First Step in Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Medicine is sufficient to cure diseases, but if the medicine is not suitable for the disease, it can kill people. This is like water that can float a boat, but it can also capsize it. The key lies in using it properly and judging it by ourselves. Now I will take the treatment of gonorrhea as an example, and it can be believed to be true. Since the development of science is advancing rapidly, the treatment of gonorrhea is no longer just the speculation of ordinary inferior doctors in the past, sitting in a well and watching the sky. Saying how to treat it is ineffective, and how to treat it is ineffective. For example, in terms of the relationship between chemical therapy and the treatment of gonorrhea, it did not start today, but those who do not know it think that this is the latest treatment for gonorrhea, which is also not true. This therapy started very early, but because there were no doctors with real knowledge and learning (not to mention patients), it was regarded as a sudden rise in treatment. Chemical therapy has made significant contributions to gonorrhea, but it is not for ordinary doctors to speak nonsense and claim it as their own invention. Because inventing a special medicine for gonorrhea is definitely not something that doctors who are busy with diagnosis all day long can get involved in. The invention of a special medicine must be done by real scholars who work tirelessly in the laboratory all day long, and then they may gain something. This can be further proved by looking at Dr. Peter in Germany. Dr. Peter is a modern master of gonorrhea. The "Kelinong" he invented has gone through countless hardships and has a never-say-die heart and the courage to rise again and again. When he used the protein and yellow pigment, two precious components of "Kelinong," he spent endless effort to gradually improve and eliminate bad impurities, and then operated it with scientific methods. After countless animal experiments and clinical experiments by specialized physicians in major hospitals, it finally succeeded. The time spent has exceeded 30 years. Ask how difficult it is to invent a special medicine. It is definitely not something that everyone can claim to have invented.</p>
<p>Therefore, all new and old leucorrhea that has not been cured by other chemical therapies or local surgery, as well as general patent medicines that boast of being able to cure in three or five days, cannot be completely cured, and "Kelinong" can cure them all. It has long been proven by international medical experts that prostatitis, epididymitis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., are difficult to cure without taking "Kelinong." In short, to solve the leucorrhea that is personally painful, you must first choose a special medicine. Otherwise, it will be difficult to completely eliminate the lingering gonorrhea in my life. Gonorrhea patients should keep this firmly in mind.</p>

<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>As a doctor and with my actual experience in treating tuberculosis for more than a few years, I deeply know that the lung disease holy medicine "Bufei Nal" has an effect that often exceeds expectations. In treating tuberculosis, it has significant effects on hemoptysis, expectoration, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, reduced appetite, fatigue, night sweats, etc. It is a particularly effective oral medicine for treating tuberculosis. It is especially effective in relieving cough and resolving phlegm. No matter how stubborn the cough is, as long as you take "Bufei Nal," you can relieve the cough within three hours, and it can be completely cured in a short period of time. It is the most reliable oral medicine for preventing tuberculosis when it has not yet developed into tuberculosis.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Gonorrhea Lecture <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road No. 9 and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Strengthen Your Belief in the Treatment of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>It is difficult to cure for a lifetime if you work hard for one day and slack off for ten days.</p>
<p>In the acute stage of gonorrhea, proper treatment is not difficult (this refers to legal and symptomatic treatment). However, patients and doctors often lose the opportunity to cure the disease in the midst of panic during acute gonorrhea. Because patients cannot tolerate the pain to the bone during acute gonorrhea, they cannot help but ask doctors to treat the pain to seek a temporary peace. Doctors also cater to the patient's psychology and do not hesitate to confuse the inherent steps in treating gonorrhea. When the pain of gonorrhea gradually decreases, the patient thinks that this is a good phenomenon that is improving day by day. In fact, this is a symptom of acute to chronic, which is more difficult to treat than acute. Doctors also know this, but they do not say it in their hearts, just delaying the time. Patients often seem lost due to such poor treatment. In the future, they will lose their determination to cure the disease completely, and often work hard for one day and slack off for ten days, which is difficult to cure for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Fortunately, don't indulge in the maze and turn back to the shore.</p>
<p>In my opinion, patients with this type of gonorrhea should strengthen their belief that gonorrhea can be completely cured. At the same time, they should quickly choose a responsible doctor or a special medicine. Then, even if gonorrhea has reached a hopeless state, it is not difficult to recover what has already fallen. In terms of electrotherapy, German static electrotherapy and X-ray electrotherapy can be used interchangeably. Their sterilization power has just the right advantage, and it is also supplemented by the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" so that cells produce an anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect after taking it. In this way, even any stubborn and difficult to cure gonorrhea can be cured in a short period of time. I have been in clinical practice for nearly 20 years. Since adopting this therapy, the results of treating gonorrhea have greatly improved. This is not without reason. Clinic hours: 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From now on, each diagnosis will only cost 5 corners of the diagnosis fee.</p>

<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea can be roughly divided into three categories. The mildest symptom is nocturnal emission, the decisive is spermatorrhea, and the most serious is slippery essence. At this point, it is really not suitable to delay and deceive yourself. You should quickly seek reasonable treatment.</p>
<p>Many people are inherently strong, but after committing masturbation, they become prematurely aging. Therefore, if you only take spermatorrhea medicine without abstaining from masturbation, it can be said to be completely ineffective. At this time, the treatment must be to clear your mind and reduce your desires, and not involve evil thoughts, so that you can abstain from masturbation. Take three tablets of "Body Kang," made from testicle essence, three times a day. It has a good effect on treating neurasthenia, brain weakness, insomnia, and back pain. No matter how severe the symptoms are, it has the magic of reviving the dead. If you feel frequent spermatorrhea or have slippery essence, you should also take "Nais Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop it immediately.</p>

<p>Hitler to Deliver Speech Today; German Newspaper Comments Advocate for Our Country</p>
<p>(Berlin) Reliable sources here recently stated that when Führer Hitler delivers a speech in the Reichstag tomorrow, he will first discuss the achievements of the Nazi Party in power for the past six years, and then discuss diplomatic events. It is expected to take half an hour to complete the speech. Loudspeakers have been installed throughout the country, and the speech will also be broadcast in the capital of Czechoslovakia and the capital of Slovakia. All schools in Germany will have a day off. The Reichstag has been newly arranged with a total of 22 rows of seats. Government officials and Nazi leaders will sit in the first row, and the 850 members of parliament will sit in the remaining 21 rows. Among the members of parliament, 28 are under the age of 30. The youngest member is a member from the Sudetenland, only 26 years old. Several German members of the Czech parliament have also been invited to attend. Italian Undersecretary of State Farinacci is currently visiting here and will also attend as a representative of Italy. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris: As German Führer Hitler is to deliver a speech in the Reichstag tomorrow, observers in political circles here recently expressed the opinion that the evolution of the international situation will depend on Italy's wishes regarding the Mediterranean issue and the assistance Germany can provide in this matter. Although the Italian authorities have unilaterally declared the termination of the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935, they have not yet made any special demands to the French government. From the perspective of the situation in Rome, the Italian authorities will likely wait until the Spanish Nationalist forces have achieved final victory before clearly stating their wishes and initiating discussions, which is expected to happen soon. Since Germany is not the main player in the Mediterranean issue, it is unlikely that Führer Hitler will act as a spokesperson for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in his speech in the Reichstag tomorrow and explain Italy's wishes on his behalf. As things stand, the views expressed by the Italian side through semi-official channels are not compatible with those of France. In other words, the "rights" that Italy seeks to enjoy in certain places are in conflict with French sovereignty. France has also stated that it will never cede an inch of land, as can be seen from the French National Assembly's discussion of foreign policy on the 26th of this month. At this point, Italian newspapers have repeatedly mentioned the imminent outbreak of war, and the Italian authorities have also called up a batch of reservists born in 1901. Prime Minister Mussolini and Undersecretary of State Farinacci (currently in Berlin) have successively issued strong statements. Responsible officials here are naturally paying close attention with all their spirit. The Chief of General Staff, General Gamelin, extended his visit to various territories in North Africa for this reason. As for the Berlin-Rome political axis, there is no doubt that it has a connected relationship, as can be seen from the fact that the opinions of Italian newspapers are often echoed by German newspapers. However, although public opinion is so strongly advocated at this moment, there are no major diplomatic actions. It is possible that Germany is currently focusing on Central Europe and may not change its course and suddenly move towards the Mediterranean. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) As the "Greater German" Reichstag is about to convene, the Nazi Party's organ newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, recently reviewed Italy's stated desires under the title "Italy and France" and analyzed the possible strategic consequences of an Italian-Spanish alliance in the event of war between Italy and France. The discussion of this issue in the German newspapers is led by the Völkischer Beobachter, which stated: "After the conquest of Abyssinia, Italy formed an axis with a resurgent Germany, and since then, Italy's existence has been filled with its true value and true meaning." Considering the remnants of the ancient Roman Empire, if Carthage (now the French port of Tunis) was not owned by Rome, then the Roman Empire could not maintain the province of Pannonia (an ancient Roman province located along the Danube River, south of Vienna). Similarly, if Italy cannot control the Mediterranean, then even if it wants to retain Central Europe, it is just wishful thinking. History shows that the missions of Germany and Italy in Europe are unique and must be carried out in cooperation. Otherwise, they will not be able to control Western and Eastern Europe and will be controlled by Western and Eastern Europe. Until recently, Italy was active in Africa, but the League of Nations hindered it. When the League of Nations had to end its sanctions, Italy sought further development in the western Mediterranean, which led to a direct conflict with France. France is the Carthage of modern Rome. The ancient war between Rome and Carthage broke out within the borders of Spain. Today, the conflict between Italy and France is the same. Because Spain is located on the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and has colonies in North Africa, it is naturally a valuable ally of Italy. With its help, it can break through the gates of Gibraltar and overthrow France's advantage in the western Mediterranean. Moreover, the Spanish Balearic Islands and Spanish Morocco in North Africa, if deployed by Italy, can cut off direct communication between France and its native African troops and cut off their source. At the same time, Italy will certainly strongly support Spain's various demands on the international neutral port of Tangier, Morocco, and West Africa. This is mutually beneficial in international affairs and is politically just and right. As for French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Corsica and Tunisia, it only proves that although the Treaty of Versailles has been repeatedly frustrated in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe, France still cannot fully understand that the "reunification movement" of Nice and Corsica (originally belonging to Italy, ceded to France) will be a barrier to Franco-Italian relations. However, France has failed to understand this. Today's France is gloomy and declining in birth rates, while Italy is full of vitality and fresh blood. It only needs space to develop naturally. France believes in weapons, while Italy believes in combatants. France believes in material things, while Italy believes in spirit. These are the differences between France and Italy. However, Italy can rely on the German-Italian axis on the one hand, and share weal and woe with a revitalized Spain, concluding a military alliance. In addition, the emerging nationalism of Islamic countries can be its backing. All these supports are not to be regretted, and the strength of Italy itself is not even taken into account. Can an eloquent lawyer win a lawsuit, but can he create history?" (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Führer Hitler issued an order today stipulating that the "Nazi Party's mechanized troops" should become a reserve force for the German army's mechanized units, and should organize specialized schools to train soldiers. In the future, new recruits must be trained in these schools before joining the Party's mechanized troops and practice with various tanks used by the regular army. Retired soldiers of the Party's mechanized troops should participate in exercises organized by the mechanized units on a regular basis during peacetime to maintain their proficiency.

<p>30,000 Killed, Over 60,000 Injured</p>
<p>Chilean Capital: According to news received tonight, the earthquake in Chile has affected an area of 4,000 square miles. At least 30,000 people have died in the earthquake, and 65,000 have been injured. It is the most severe earthquake in South America in the 20th century, and the tragedy is unprecedented. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Chilean Capital: Following the violent earthquake that occurred in various parts of southern Chile yesterday, the cities of Chillán and Florida, as well as the three small villages of Quircio, Tomé, and San Carlos, have been completely destroyed. The total loss is estimated to be no less than 1,500,000,000 pesos (Chilean currency). Corpses are scattered throughout the villages of Chillán, and have not yet been cleared, resulting in a foul odor and rampant epidemics. The mayor of that city has requested that the central government issue gas masks to prevent epidemics. The government is making every effort to provide relief to the disaster area, sending food and medicine by plane and ship every day, and instructing the military authorities to be responsible for maintaining order in the disaster area and promoting relief efforts.

<h3 id="e45">French Finance Minister's Speech: Finances Stable, Gold Reserves Greatly Increased <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address tonight, stating that the fiscal policies he has implemented since taking office have achieved remarkable results, and the franc has become a strong currency. "Of all the currencies in Europe, the franc is the safest." The reason why he implemented a free currency policy and refused to implement an exchange control system is twofold: "First, the situations in Germany and France are different. When Germany previously managed its exchange rate, its short-term debts to various countries amounted to 90,000,000,000 francs. The country's ban on the outflow of funds was tantamount to telling various countries, 'The 90,000,000,000 francs owed to you will definitely be retained.' In France, however, as a creditor country, the amount owed to it is also around 90,000,000,000 francs. If exchange control is implemented, it is tantamount to telling various countries, 'You owe 90,000,000,000 francs, feel free to keep it.' Is that acceptable? Second, the reflux of gold and capital. The Bank of France is the only issuing bank in the world that receives gold every day. For some time, capital reflux has been uninterrupted. If an exchange control system is implemented, there is no possibility of capital reflux. At this moment, France has a huge amount of gold reserves. To illustrate, even the most expensive foreign aircraft, France can buy as many as 5,000 at once. In addition, from January 1 to January 24 of this year, the total amount of savings nationwide was 1,150,000,000 francs, compared to 417,000,000 francs for the entire month of January last year, an increase of nearly threefold. The prices of public bonds in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the Netherlands have fallen by 2 to 4 percent since the end of October last year. The market price of French public bonds has increased on average. Since October 28 last year, various recurring expenses of no less than 12,000,000,000 francs have been fully covered by the national treasury. The financial situation has improved as described above, and there has also been significant improvement in the economic situation, as can be seen from the increase in tax revenue. For example, production tax revenue from December 20 last year to January 20 this year was 421,000,000 francs, an increase of 71,000,000 francs compared to the estimated amount, and an increase of 113,000,000 francs compared to the month from December 20, 1937, to January 20, 1938. The increase in various direct tax revenues is also the same. The production index has increased by 6 percent in two months. For example, steel production in October last year was 511,000 tons, which increased to 580,000 tons in December. The business volume of major department stores in Beijing in November and December last year also increased, which has not been seen for a long time." The current economic policy should be promoted in a "thorough" manner. "We have saved expenses on various civilian public works, and other expenses that are beneficial but not very urgent will be temporarily postponed, and priority will be given to manufacturing aircraft and machine guns. For this reason, although military expenditures have increased, we can still afford it. In short, there is much that can be done in Europe besides resorting to war. A strong France is both calm and determined. Today it is strong enough to resist, and tomorrow it can come out and cooperate. It is hoped that the world can understand this." (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The news of Schnurre, the chief of the Central European Section of the Commercial Department of the German Foreign Ministry, coming here has been widely commented on by Soviet political figures. However, German figures have a more reserved attitude. It was rumored that Schnurre would come with a large number of attendants and bankers, but it is now known that this is not true. It is possible that the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, who is currently on vacation in Germany, will return to his post with him. After Schnurre arrives here, he will meet with a certain representative of the Soviet government, but who the representative is and what is being waited for are unknown to the outside world. Sources here only say that Schnurre is a political and economic expert, and the commercial agreement signed between Germany and Yugoslavia was drafted by him and is highly regarded by Führer Hitler. Regarding the statement that Germany will supply the Soviet Union with military supplies, including aircraft and ammunition, German figures here recently stated that Führer Hitler has agreed to supply the Soviet Union with various materials for the military industry, but he is unwilling to supply finished military equipment to "ideological enemies." For this reason, sources said that the Soviet Union has always purchased the most military equipment from the United States. In the future, no matter which country is willing to supply new military equipment, it will be happy to purchase it. However, it is unbelievable that Germany is willing to supply military equipment on the condition that the Soviet Union provides guarantees on its use. It is reported that the Soviet government is currently conducting commercial negotiations with Germany, and is also conducting negotiations with the Polish economic delegation. The Latvian delegation is scheduled to arrive here on the 10th of next month, and the Finnish delegation will also come to Moscow in the near future. In addition, the Iranian representative will also come here soon to sign a commercial treaty with the Soviet government. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Overseas Chinese Hold Meeting in San Francisco; Prepare to Establish General Propaganda Office <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Promote Movement to Amend Chinese Exclusion Act; Raise One Million US Dollars in National Defense Bonds</p>
<p>Continental Report Airmail, San Francisco, January 14: Overseas Chinese on the Pacific Coast recently held an important meeting here to discuss the plan to immediately establish a general propaganda office to disseminate information and achieve effective results. As this news was being sent, the meeting was still in progress, but it was heard that the representatives were very much in favor of this plan. The propaganda office will become an agency for receiving and distributing Chinese propaganda materials on the West Coast of the United States. After its establishment, the central government will not have to communicate with more than fifty overseas Chinese centers in the United States, but only with the propaganda office, which will be able to make contact with overseas Chinese and American groups. It is now proposed to establish the propaganda office in San Francisco, with one resident manager, and if possible, several deputy managers and one secretary. This resolution was made immediately after President Roosevelt sent a message to the 76th Congress on January 4. In his message to Congress, President Roosevelt advocated amending the Chinese Exclusion Act and implementing sanctions against aggressor countries, and one of the purposes of the San Francisco meeting was to discuss ways to promote public opinion in order to realize President Roosevelt's recommendations. Mr. Feng (translation), chairman of the China War Relief Committee in the United States, served as chairman of the meeting. Mr. Zheng (translation), the Chinese Consul in Los Angeles, and Mr. Tolins, director of publicity for the American United Committee to Boycott Japanese Goods, attended and gave speeches. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting at the first session as follows: (1) To make public opinion support President Roosevelt's proposal to amend the Chinese Exclusion Act; (2) To have Congress pass legislation authorizing President Roosevelt to distinguish aggressor countries and prohibit the shipment of munitions to those countries; (3) To publicize and expand the boycott of Japanese goods; (4) To continue to provide charitable relief to Chinese civilians; (5) To establish a general propaganda office to organize and cooperate in propaganda work on the Pacific Coast. The United China War Relief Association in the United States is the central agency for raising war and relief funds on the Pacific Coast. After the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou last year, the confidence of the Association was inevitably shaken, but due to the unremitting efforts of overseas Chinese leaders in San Francisco such as Mr. Feng and Mr. Tang, as well as the guarantee from the central government and the Guangdong provincial government that the losses in the two places were by no means "sell-outs" but orderly retreats, and that the funds previously remitted to Hankou and Guangzhou had been received correctly, please rest assured, the confidence of the overseas Chinese was restored. Overseas Chinese in San Francisco also launched a movement to raise one million US dollars in national defense bonds. Half of the amount has already been raised after two weeks. Because the Golden Gate Exposition will open on February 18, the overseas Chinese want to end this movement within two weeks so that they can focus on business during the Exposition.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Yellow River Diverts into Huai River and Enters Jiangsu; Han Guojun and Others Telegraph to Request Closure <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Huai Canal Embankment Luckily Has Not Collapsed; Failure to Act Now Will Lead to Eternal Calamity in the Future</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: After the breaches of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and Zhaokou in Henan Province, a flood control committee was specially established due to its location at the tail end near the sea. Flood prevention and rescue were carried out in different areas. For four months, the dikes of the Huai Canal and lake were fortunately not breached, and safety was celebrated. However, the affected area was vast, and although repeated telegrams were sent to the central government to plan for closure as soon as possible to cut off the source, it was temporarily difficult to start the closure due to the proximity to the war zone. However, the wheat crops in the affected counties have been lost in vain. The spring plowing season is approaching. If remedial measures are not taken urgently, the consequences will be even more unbearable. Therefore, the authorities have actively drained the accumulated water in the Lixiahe area and organized a dredging project committee for waterways entering the sea. They have also measured the silted rivers in three groups and submitted a request to the central government for a subsidy of 100,000 yuan to complete the project. Local elders in Jiangsu Province, such as Han Zhishi, are deeply concerned and have repeatedly telegraphed to the provincial government to appeal. Yesterday, they sent another telegram to Niu Yongjian and Gu Zhutong to appeal. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Niu et al.</p>
<p>To Mr. Niu Tiren, Mr. Chen Guofu, Mr. Ye Chucang, and Mr. Yu Jingtang of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Chongqing: Since the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou and Zhaokou, it has diverted into the Huai River and entered Jiangsu, directly heading towards Hongze Lake, crossing the canal and inundating more than ten counties east of the canal. The water depth is several feet on the flat ground. It is already so in winter, and what will it be like when the river floods three times next spring? In the past, the ports returning to the sea were the outlets of the Huai River. As they are farther and farther from the sea, the discharge is extremely small. Now that the Yellow River water has been added, how can they bear it? The counties of Huaiyang will inevitably be submerged into lakes, and will even encroach on the Yangtze River. If the breaches are not quickly closed at this time, a great disaster will be imminent. You are in charge of the government of Jiangsu, care about the old territory, and have always been concerned about the prevention of floods in northern Jiangsu. You should not bear to see this remnant go to ruin. I have already jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that you earnestly consult with the government to quickly plan for closure and start construction on a specific date to save the people from disaster and avoid a great catastrophe. This urgent telegram is submitted, hoping to receive a reply.</p>
<p>Telegram to Gu Zhutong</p>
<p>This year, the Yellow River breached its banks and diverted east into the Huai River, directly inundating Jiangsu. The dozen or so counties in Huaiyang have been turned into swamps. The extent of the flooding, I trust, is obvious to you. Since the Frost's Descent, the source has become even stronger. In the area around the upper and lower reaches of Liyun, boats travel on flat ground, and the water depth is over several feet. As we approach the severe winter, the accumulated water does not recede. The fields are submerged underwater, and the autumn planting has been missed, and spring plowing will also be missed. If there is no harvest for the whole year next year, the famine and displacement will be unimaginable. Guojun and others have already telegraphed to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that a senior official be appointed to quickly close the breaches in Mou and Zheng, but due to the current situation, there may be obstacles. We also implore you to consult with experts from the League of Nations to start construction as soon as possible. We have not yet received a reply, presumably because the overall anti-Japanese war makes it impossible to take into account the interests of one corner. However, for the sake of Jiangsu, the corner of northern Jiangsu is of great importance. Now, Chairman Han has repeatedly telegraphed to Guojun, instructing him to organize the dredging project committee for waterways entering the sea in Lixiahe. The ports entering the sea in the lower reaches cannot smoothly discharge the Huai River. How can they discharge the Yellow River? Dredging the tributaries is just a small effort, and the effect is minimal. The fundamental plan is still to quickly close the breaches of the Yellow River. You once governed Jiangsu and witnessed the aftermath of the Huai Canal breach. The subsequent projects were planned and directed by you. Recalling the past is like seeing it now. The Huai River has already caused disaster, let alone the Yellow River. Now, you are leading the old territory from afar and caring for the old land. You should not bear to see this remnant go to ruin. If no action is taken now, the Yellow River will change its course, which may become an eternal calamity. We implore you to telegraph to Chairman Chiang, asking him to consider the people of northern Jiangsu, who are related to the rear support for the anti-Japanese war, and approve consultation with the central government to quickly plan the closure, so that the work can be completed before the peach blossoms bloom, in order to eliminate the Yellow River disaster and save the submerged land. This urgent telegram is submitted, hoping to receive a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Chinese Army Active in Western Zhejiang; Once Captured Chongtong <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Puppet Governor Arrested and Interrogated</p>
<p>Tongxiang Correspondence: Tongxiang is the center of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and is strategically important. Therefore, since its fall, the Chinese army has been unusually active there. It is reported that recently (the 27th), soldiers of the ××th division of the Chinese army set out from the ××th base and launched a full-scale attack on the city. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army, due to its small force (only one Sugi Team stationed in the county, numbering seventy to eighty people), did not dare to resist and tightly closed the four city gates. Thereupon, the Chinese army concentrated artillery fire to fiercely attack the city gate, eventually destroying the city gate and rushing into the city. The Japanese soldiers then fled in panic along the highway towards Puyuan. The Chinese army fiercely pursued, killing many enemies, and at the same time carried out a major search for traitors in the city. At this time, the county's puppet governor, Mr. Wang, and Fukushima, director of the propaganda outreach office, were about to jump into the river to escape because they had not retreated. They were spotted by the Chinese army and arrested and sent to the ×××th headquarters for disposal that day. It is also known that at about 6 p.m. that afternoon, the Japanese army that had retreated to Puyuan, with the help of reinforcements from Jiaxing, launched a counterattack along the highway. The Chinese soldiers, due to their hasty capture and lack of fortifications, found it difficult to hold their position. Therefore, they fought back on one hand and retreated to their original positions on the other hand. Also, Chongde is a neighboring county of Tongxiang, so when the Chinese army attacked Tongxiang, Chongde was also captured by the Chinese army, but it was abandoned to avoid sacrifices. In addition, in Pinghu, the Chinese army under Liu Jianxu attacked a certain town near the county seat on the night of January 28. The gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, and all the residents in the city were awakened from their dreams.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Just Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, Ma Yuhang Assassinated Yesterday <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Shot Dead in the Xinxin Hotel, Suffered Severe Brain Damage</p>
<p>Ma Had Recently Been Appointed as a Councilor by the "Renovation Government"</p>
<p>An assassination occurred at approximately 7 PM yesterday inside the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road in the Public Concession. The perpetrator is still at large. The incident is believed to be politically motivated. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Around the 26th of this month, a male traveler, appearing to be nearly sixty years old, checked into the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road. His demeanor and speech suggested he was a wealthy and prominent individual. The hotel receptionist led him to a large room, number 605, on the sixth floor, where he would be staying. He registered in the guest book as Cai Jun, from Guangdong, aged 41. When asked about his origin, he stated he was from Hong Kong and claimed he came to Shanghai purely to visit relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Frequent Visitors</p>
<p>In the days that followed, he rarely went out. However, he received numerous visitors daily, mostly high-class guests. As a result, his room was often full of people, and the host was busy entertaining. The hotel staff was attentive and accommodating. Yesterday evening, around 7:30 PM, more than a dozen guests were chatting with the host in his room. At the time, the host was wearing a grey serge cotton jacket, white velvet trousers, and slippers. He was sitting on the sofa chair to the right of the door, holding the evening newspaper, reading and talking with a satisfied expression.</p>
<p>Sudden Gunshot</p>
<p>At that moment, the nearby hotel attendant suddenly heard a gunshot coming from the room. Shortly after, many of the guests who had been sitting in the room rushed out, fleeing for their lives, and shouts arose. The attendants hurried to investigate and found the room empty. The guest named Cai was lying on the floor, covered in blood, still groaning. The attendants were shocked and reported the incident to the front desk, who then informed the police.</p>
<p>Barely Breathing</p>
<p>The Old Gate Police Station, which was nearby, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives upon receiving the alarm. Our reporter also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. The tables and chairs in the room were overturned and in disarray. The injured man was lying stiffly on the floor, with blood stains all around. His breathing was very faint. The detectives immediately called for an ambulance, which rushed him to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. At the same time, they searched the room for clues. They found a spent bullet casing and photographed all the footprints and fingerprints in the room, taking them back to the police station for filing.</p>
<p>Succumbed to Injuries</p>
<p>After the injured man arrived at the hospital, the doctors examined his wounds and discovered that the bullet had entered through the left temple and exited under the right ear, completely damaging his brain. Despite all efforts, he succumbed to his injuries and died at 9:45 PM that night. The hospital reported the death to the police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They found a business card and a travel permit issued to him by the "Renovation Government." Thus, his real name was discovered. The body will be sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue for examination this morning.</p>
<p>True Name Found</p>
<p>The name printed on the business card was Ma Yuhang. The special travel permit also bore the name Ma Yuhang and was signed by Wen Zongyao, the "President of the Legislative Yuan" of the false "Renovation Government." The occupation field stated "Councilor of the Renovation Government." The reporter recalled that Ma had previously served as a Councilor of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission and was currently a member of the National Government's Resources Committee. It is unimaginable that he would commit this outrageous act; perhaps it is another person. However, after comparing the photos with the real Ma Yuhang, it was confirmed to be the same person.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Deceased</p>
<p>Ma Yuhang was from Huizhou, Guangdong, and was 60 years old. He was a Xiucai (successful candidate in the imperial examination) of the late Qing Dynasty. He then entered the Guangdong School of Law and Politics and was a fellow townsman of Chen Jiongming. In 1920, he served as the Director of the Shantou Funding Bureau. In 1921, he served as the Director of the Hainan Island Civil Administration Office, the Director of the Guangdong Finance Department, and the Director of the Economic Investigation Bureau. Since this case occurred, the police have been investigating with all their might. As for the circumstances of the shooting, how the assassin entered, or whether they were among the guests in the room, it is still difficult to analyze and is under close investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e51">On the Night of January 28th, Chinese Guerrillas Display Their Might <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Burned Down the Japanese Headquarters on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, Killed Japanese Soldiers and Captured Cannons</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the 7th anniversary of the January 28th Songhu Anti-Japanese War. Ding Xishan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Suburban Guerrillas, issued a decree to all units to attack Japanese bases on that evening. Political instructors were also dispatched to each unit to participate in the battle. The Sixth Battalion directly under the Eighth Detachment of the Shanghai West Guerrillas also received a secret order from the headquarters to attack the Japanese headquarters at the Shanghai Middle School on the Shanghai-Minhang Road in western Shanghai. This location is a key point on the Shanghai-Minhang and Songhu roads and is the base for the Japanese army in western Shanghai. However, the school buildings are sturdy and the scale is grand, making it difficult to attack. After receiving the order, Battalion Commander Jin gathered more than 400 loyal and brave soldiers and personally led them to march more than 50 miles in the dark to the location. Before the departure, instructors Zhou Qiang delivered speeches. At that time, the soldiers shouted slogans vowing to die, and their voices shook the mountains. The onlookers also raised their arms and shouted. The scene was tragic and impassioned, enough to bring tears to people's eyes. When they reached the destination, the Japanese army was unaware. When hand grenades and shouts of killing erupted, they hastily fought back. At this time, officers and soldiers rushed to the front. More than a hundred Japanese soldiers used cannons and machine guns to bombard the area. The sounds of gunfire and artillery were deafening. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand and fled east onto warships. At this time, the entire team rushed into the Japanese headquarters and poured gasoline on the buildings. The flames soared into the sky, and the Japanese army's food reserves and military supplies were almost completely destroyed. At this time, the searchlights of the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River shone in all directions and fired several cannons as a show of force. The guerrillas, seeing that their mission was completed, retreated in all directions. In this great battle, three Chinese team members were slightly injured, one cannon and several Type 38 rifles were captured, six or seven Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless military supplies were lost. This Japanese headquarters, hated by the people of western Shanghai, was finally completely destroyed. This action not only shows the combat effectiveness, loyalty, and bravery of the Chinese guerrillas, but also makes people aware of the weakness of the Japanese army, and that defeat is imminent.</p>

<p>Reasons for Detention Not Yet Clear; Kailing Arrives in Funing Without Unloading Cargo</p>
<p>The Haida, Yongzhen, and other three vessels sailing between Shanghai and Funing were detained by Japanese warships and Qingdao customs patrol boats outside Hexing Town. Yesterday, they reported to Shanghai that they had been forced to sail to Qingdao at 10:00 AM yesterday. Consuls from the British and Norwegian consulates are scheduled to negotiate with the Japanese side for their release today. The Kailing vessel previously test-sailed to Funing. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Funing Route</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1936, the China United Dock and Warehouse Company, in order to develop the cultivation in the Huaibei area and facilitate commercial transport, attempted a direct route from Shanghai to Funing via the Sheyang River. The Shanghai export journey takes only 40 hours to reach Hexing Town, downstream from Funing. After the war, Chinese vessels were forced to suspend operations, and foreign merchants took the opportunity to send vessels on this route. These include the Kailing vessel of the British firm Luckee Shipping Company, the Yongzhen vessel of the British firm Tong Hing Navigation Company, the Haida vessel of the Norwegian firm Subei Joint Transportation Company, and the Hafva vessel of the Norwegian firm Fucheng Company. Goods from various counties in northern Jiangsu are transferred through this port.</p>
<p>Three Vessels Detained</p>
<p>The Norwegian Haida vessel and the British Yongzhen vessel both sailed from Shanghai to Funing on the 19th of this month. The Norwegian Hafva vessel sailed from Shanghai to Funing on the 23rd of this month. After the above three vessels arrived at Hexing Town in Funing, they unloaded their cargo and prepared to load cargo to return to Shanghai. On the morning of the 26th, Hexing Town was bombed by Japanese aircraft. The three vessels left Hexing Town to return to Shanghai in order to avoid danger. On the 27th, they were detained by Japanese warships and Qingdao customs patrol boats in the Yanghekou waters off the coast and forced to sail north. Negotiations by the shipowners were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Report Arrived in Qingdao</p>
<p>The Hafva, Yongzhen, and Haida vessels reported to their respective companies in Shanghai yesterday morning that they had arrived in Qingdao at 10:30 AM on the 29th. The reasons for the detention were not mentioned in the telegram. The above three vessels were originally foreign vessels and were not sold to foreign merchants after the war. The cargo they carried did not contain any prohibited items, so the companies were not clear about the reasons for the detention. They have reported to the British Consul General in Shanghai and the Norwegian Consul in Shanghai, respectively. It is heard that the British and Norwegian consuls are scheduled to negotiate with the Japanese side today (Monday).</p>
<p>Kailing Test Sailing</p>
<p>The British Kailing vessel loaded goods such as cloth and cigarettes in Shanghai the day before yesterday and sailed to Funing. At 5:00 PM yesterday, the company received a report from the shipowner stating that the Kailing had arrived in Funing yesterday afternoon and was temporarily anchored outside Hexing Town. The British shipowner, in order to be cautious, telegraphed the Japanese authorities in Qingdao to ask for permission for the vessel to enter and unload its cargo. If permission is granted by the Japanese authorities, it is scheduled to enter Hexing Town to unload its cargo tomorrow morning. It is heard that the value of the cargo loaded on the vessel is one million yuan in national currency.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Garrison Command recently issued a telegram ordering Dinghai and Zhenhai to strictly inspect all sailboats entering and leaving the ports of Zhejiang Province, transporting smuggled goods. The original text roughly stated that there have been frequent incidents of sailboats smuggling goods into the interior for sale through coastal ports in Zhejiang Province, and taking the opportunity to smuggle local products to aid the enemy. Those responsible for inspection have even privately released strong laborers for export. This is a serious violation of the prohibition order. It is stipulated that all inspection units must strictly comply with the regulations in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route Resumed; Measurement and Registration of Vessels <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Moufou, Liangzhou, and Xinanna Vessels all Sailed Directly to Ningbo for the First Time Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Headquarters of the ×th Army Corps recently re-promulgated and amended the Provisional Measures for Navigation in Eastern Zhejiang and approved the resumption of direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo, shipping companies are satisfied and are completing measurement and licensing procedures in accordance with the newly revised measures. The Moufou, Xinanna, and Liangzhou vessels all sailed directly to Ningbo yesterday. The Deping vessel will also sail directly to Ningbo tomorrow, no longer detouring. The Modern News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the following:</p>
<p>New Measures, Shipping Companies Satisfied</p>
<p>According to a source in the shipping industry who spoke to the Modern News Agency reporter yesterday, the operation of vessels in the coastal ports of eastern Zhejiang was previously the responsibility of the local shipping administration offices of the Ministry of Communications. Since the outbreak of the war, due to national defense concerns, it has been changed to be controlled by military organs. The military commanders issue orders regarding the blockade and opening of ports, and the orders are frequently changed, making it difficult for shipping companies to comply. The fact that direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo was not allowed required detours through Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Taiwan, causing great inconvenience to passenger and cargo transport. Although the Zhejiang provincial authorities readjusted, promulgated measures, and conducted registration, it still failed to address the key issues. Recently, since the promulgation of the amended navigation measures, the content is more realistic and practical. Furthermore, the registration of each shipping vessel must first be measured by the local shipping administration office to check whether the hull is stable. A guarantee of more than one year of operation must also be provided before the license is issued and its operation is approved. The measures are very appropriate and are sufficient to prevent speculation and ensure passenger safety. Therefore, shipping companies from various countries have expressed satisfaction.</p>
<p>Measurement and Registration of Vessels</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang authorities have thoroughly adjusted shipping and abolished the previously established navigation measures, and separately promulgated the new amended measures, the garrison commands of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo have issued orders to the local shipping guilds, informing the shipping companies to comply. It is learned that the 48 foreign vessels previously approved for operation on each route (actually only 47 vessels, because Anna and Xinanna were originally one vessel, and after Kaibo sank, there are now only 46 vessels), are preparing to comply with the regulations, and will apply to the Wenzhou and Ningbo shipping administration offices for measurement and inspection of the hull. After obtaining the certificate, they will find two or more guarantor shops, and provide a guarantee of more than one year of operation, before submitting the guarantee to the garrison command for submission to the Headquarters of the ×th Army Corps for review. According to the investigation by the Modern News Agency reporter, after these restrictions, the number of vessels approved for operation will be reduced by at least one-third.</p>
<p>Moufou and Other Vessels Sail Directly to Ningbo</p>
<p>After the direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo was approved by the authorities, the Moufou vessel of the German firm Rehder &amp; Co. and the Liangzhou vessel of the British firm Taikoo Dockyard both sailed directly to Ningbo from Shanghai yesterday. The Xinanna vessel of the American firm Wilh. Wilhelmsen, after being released from Ningbo and returning to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to sail to Taiwan and then to Ningbo. Now that direct navigation between Shanghai and Ningbo has been approved, it also sailed directly to Ningbo yesterday afternoon. In addition, the Deping vessel of the Italian firm Sino-Italian Company arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning and is scheduled to sail directly to Ningbo tomorrow, no longer detouring through Wenzhou and Taiwan. In the future, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo will become more convenient.</p>

<p>Industrial Groups and Political and Academic Circles Plan to Hold a Memorial Service on a Selected Day</p>
<p>Zhang Tuian, an industrialist from Nantong, passed away on the 26th of this month. His biography has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the dressing of the corpse took place at the China Funeral Home. Mr. Zhang and his elder brother, Mr. Se'an, had been running the Tonghai Industry for many years and had extensive social connections. Guests who arrived that day included Chu Minyi, Wang Dankui, Xu Jingren, Wu Yunzhai, Shen Xinqing, Liu Housheng, Xia Jiancheng, Yuan Bokui, Yu Zuoting, Pan Xulun, Lu Xuepu, Chen Taoyi, Xu Qiufan, Yin Zhiling, Li Qiqing, Zhao Shuyong, and more than a thousand Nantong Chonghai Qigu industry figures and residents. Many sent wreaths and epitaphs, too many to list. Teachers and students from Nantong College and Women's Normal School also came to pay tribute before the coffin. Zhang lived a frugal life. He left instructions that no obituary should be issued and no condolences should be accepted. His son respectfully followed his father's instructions, and the funeral was held in a frugal and simple manner. However, various industrial groups and political and academic circles related to Tonghai, because Mr. Zhang had devoted himself to villageism and had a far-reaching impact, plan to hold a joint memorial service on a selected day to express their condolences.</p>

<p>Past Recreational Place Now in Ruins; Owners Subjected to Unreasonable Treatment During Inspections</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the war in the Shanghai suburbs has shifted west for more than half a year. Zhoujiazui, where Shanghai residents used to visit on holidays, is still entirely under the control of the Japanese naval and military authorities. Although the foreign owners of the island have made strong protests, the Japanese authorities firmly refuse to return the land and real estate on the island to the owners. Moreover, unless under strict military supervision, owners are not allowed to inspect their property. It is heard that three or four groups of foreign owners were allowed by the Japanese to inspect the island under supervision. Most of these foreigners are members of the Minhang or Shanghai Rowing Club. After returning to Shanghai, they claimed that their houses were dilapidated and desolate, some were completely plundered, and others were deliberately destroyed. According to one owner, the partitions in his villa were taken away, and the remaining furniture was destroyed with heavy objects, apparently with rifle butts. Another owner said that only the four walls and ceiling of his house remained. It is said that after landing, the group was surrounded by Japanese soldiers on foot or on motorcycles, and they were not allowed to look around, but were only led to inspect each house after it had been plundered. Then they were forced to return to Shanghai. It was previously rumored that the Japanese authorities offered certain owners to negotiate directly with the Japanese authorities, rather than through their consulates, and that the Japanese authorities would be willing to pay a certain percentage of the requested compensation. This has not yet been confirmed. However, according to a member of the Foreign Real Estate Owners Association on the island, no member of the association can agree to this. Although negotiations have begun to return the property on the island to foreign owners, diplomatic circles believe that all negotiations regarding foreign rights and interests in China are extremely unsatisfactory. British, American, and French authorities in Shanghai and Tokyo have recently made requests and strong protests to the Japanese authorities, but to no avail. Some foreign owners on the island believe that the Japanese authorities are attempting to force foreigners to leave the island in order to establish a large-scale naval and military base there. Some foreigners who have visited the island agree with this view, as there are many Japanese troops stationed on the island.</p>

<h3 id="e61">On the Removal of Gonads: The Necessary Nourishment and Supplementation of Gonads <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th – According to a telegram, two members of the Minsei Party criticized the Ministry of Health and Welfare for being overly cautious and slow, failing to achieve satisfactory results in the near future. Therefore, they plan to propose a bill to remove gonads in their impeachment. They believe that this case is an urgent necessity. A member who initiated the case said: This term sounds horrifying, but men can return to work soon after the necessary surgery, and women only need to rest for two or three days...etc. Since Japan launched the Sino-Japanese War, its domestic situation has been one of poverty and exhaustion. This is known to anyone with a bit of foresight. However, using gonad removal as a remedy only serves to quench thirst with poison.</p>
<p>The reason humans have gonads is similar to plants having flower buds, and animals having testicles and ovaries. If we want to enjoy their branches and leaves, and make them particularly lush, we can remove the flower buds to make their growth exceptionally vigorous. There is also a method of castration for animals to fatten them, because our current purpose is for meat consumption. Such as the castration of chickens, ducks, cattle, and sheep for meat. In addition, there is also eugenics. For example, if a particular species is inferior or has a disease, and we do not want it to reproduce, we remove its genitals or pluck its flower buds to eradicate its reproductive function, so as not to pass on flawed genes. Although this method has been used in plants and animals, its application to humans is still controversial. Because humans are the most intelligent of all creatures, with higher functions such as intelligence, emotion, and will in addition to life, who should prosper the race? Who should be deprived of happiness? This standard is difficult to determine. Moreover, today's Japan, due to economic hardship, wants the people to focus on work, and uses gonad removal to remedy the situation. This is simply a desperate and absurd measure. However, we are unfortunate to be born in troubled times, or perhaps fortunate to be born in this great era. Due to environmental pressure or voluntary courage, in any case, we must not give up our happiness, and our work efficiency must be increased in order to cope with the current difficulties and achieve something. But our energy is limited, how can we achieve this goal? In the 20th century, the medical community has already invented effective methods to nourish and supplement gonads. The historical facts of its invention cannot be described in detail in this article due to space limitations. We can only briefly say that it has been possible to extract gonadal hormones from strong animals similar to humans, such as apes, orangutans, cattle, and sheep, and refine them into a preparation called Stan's "Gonadal Hormone" (medicines for men and women, sold in all pharmacies). After taking it, it can indeed produce sperm and nourish the kidneys overnight, and nourish the gonadal function to make it healthy. At the same time, it is effective on blood, muscles, brain, nerves, and various endocrine glands, enhancing their function. Therefore, if you continue to take it, you will definitely be able to increase your energy in a short period of time, eliminate diseases, make your body healthier, increase work efficiency, clear your mind, and revitalize your youth, achieving the effect of rejuvenation. Men who suffer from weakened reproductive function due to early masturbation and spermatorrhea, or indulgence after marriage, polygamy, or excessive work, excessive use of the brain, or congenital weakness, or imbalance after illness, resulting in frequent nocturnal emissions, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, short genitals like fingers, premature aging, brain decline and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, sallow complexion and emaciation, mental depression, and infertility after prolonged marriage, then taking this gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" is the most effective and specific remedy, without failing to achieve the effect of curing the disease. However, those who have nocturnal emissions must also take "Hymitol's Sperm-Stabilizing Pills" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, which will be even more effective. However, if patients can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by expert doctors and use other latest therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Common Diseases of Youth</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Evil Consequences and Salvation of Untreated Spermatorrhea <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>In Mr. Zhu Bolu's family precepts, there are two sentences, "Prepare for rain before it comes, and do not dig a well when thirsty" to teach his descendants. I believe that the meaning of these two sentences has unique merits in human eugenics and social evolution.</p>
<p>We are not talking about anything else now, but just about the academic skills that he will rely on to make a living in the future. Suppose a student, in the era of middle school or university, does not work hard on weekdays, only knowing to go to some places to play when there is a chance. Or, even if he is in class, his eyes are not on the books at all. When the exam period comes, he thinks to himself that it is impossible for my studies to pass, but how can I face my parents' expectations if I fail? So he is anxious and rushes to work hard, but is this kind of work hard when thirsty still timely? (As for those who are not ashamed and not anxious, such people are not worth discussing).</p>
<p>There is also a kind of young man who does not know how to cherish himself. He does not have a full understanding of the physiological structure, and he does not know how to cherish the value of health. He only indulges in temporary joy, or for a moment of impulse, he does not hesitate to damage his health, or he sleeps with prostitutes, or he indulges in masturbation. Masturbation and indulgence are the most harmful actions to the youth glands, so the sperm gate is relaxed, and there is spermatorrhea. Weak brain and insomnia, kidney deficiency and incompetence, incomplete development, tinnitus and palpitations, and various phenomena of neurasthenia throughout the body. This is a body equal to a "broken bowl" with problems everywhere, but at this time, he is still not afraid, procrastinating and lingering. When the essence is exhausted and the blood is exhausted, he is almost seriously ill and begins to worry and seek help. Even if he is lucky enough not to die, it is already very difficult!</p>
<p>In summary, I believe that no matter what you do, you should have some preparation beforehand, and for diseases that can hinder health, you should always take precautions. If you have unfortunately suffered from spermatorrhea, you must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. As for the method of treatment, on the one hand, you must be pure in heart and have few desires, and strictly observe health preservation. On the other hand, you must use "Bumitoll's Sperm-Stabilizing Pills" to consolidate your spiritual gate, so that spermatorrhea can be stopped that night, and you will not cause future troubles again. Those who have caused incomplete development, kidney deficiency and impotence, pale complexion, and emaciation due to excessive leakage should also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadal Hormone" at the same time to nourish their sperm and blood, revitalize their youth glands, and promote metabolic function. If it can be rescued in time, why should there be a sigh of "digging a well when thirsty"?</p>
<h3 id="e63">Key to Female Beauty <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Is it possible to climb a tree to catch fish?" Beauty, although eagerly pursued by every woman, seeking it in makeup is like climbing a tree to catch fish. So no wonder there are more ugly women in the world and fewer beautiful ones! Then how will women pursue beauty? This must be considered from the root of the female body. Female beauty must be based on the development of female characteristics. The development of female characteristics is necessarily based on the healthy ovarian function physiologically. If the ovarian function is healthy, the breasts will first have good development, presenting a high and elastic state. The hip bones are enlarged, and the buttocks also show development, which forms the most secret curve of female beauty in the figure. At the same time, the metabolic function must also be quite vigorous, so the skin, muscles, blood, and endocrine glands are filled with new cells, so the skin is naturally white and tender, the muscles are naturally plump, and the blood is naturally bright red. The bright red complexion is revealed on the white and tender skin, coupled with a warm smile and a graceful posture. Is this not a heavenly maiden? Men who have such a wife will naturally be deeply in love and have endless affection, and will not say "domestic flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers". Such a husband is of course so happy, and such a woman is so glorious! Therefore, truly beautiful women will never pursue it in makeup. If a woman suffers from hidden diseases such as irregular menstruation and leucorrhea, the ovarian function will be destroyed, and the metabolic function will also be reduced. Therefore, the breasts are shriveled and the face is衰, such women, even if they are covered with makeup, are only enough to show their hypocrisy and ugliness. If smart women, they must find a way from the root, that is, take ovarian preparation female "Gonadal Hormone" to nourish the ovarian function to make it healthy, and promote metabolic function to make it vigorous, then the above symptoms can be completely cured, and can make the breasts rise, the cheeks rosy, and increase the natural and precious beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Fortunately, I Jumped Out of the Trap of Spermatorrhea Today <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ziwei of Mintinein Road ××× Cotton Shop</p>
<p>Really fortunate! I, today, am like seeing the blue sky after clearing the clouds, and I jumped out of this trap of spermatorrhea. But after thinking about it, I feel that the power of famous medicine cannot be reduced. There is a need to sincerely inform the readers here!</p>
<p>I am twenty years old this year, and I have suffered from spermatorrhea for five years. In the first year of its first occurrence, the number of times was small, and people did not feel any fatigue, so I didn't take it to heart at all. Until the winter of my third year, when I was eighteen years old, I was transferred from the Suzhou branch to the Shanghai head office. The work was complicated, and the contacts were all women, so the symptoms suddenly increased sharply. Almost every one or two days, there must be nocturnal emissions, sometimes two or three times a night. At this time, I was slightly afraid, but due to economic constraints, I finally did not resolutely seek medical treatment. Time passed, and a year passed in a hurry. Until last autumn, spermatorrhea turned into spermatorrhea, and it would automatically flow out during the day. At this time, the pain in the body and mind, and the fatigue of the limbs, are simply indescribable. Knowing that if this continues, not only will my career be shaken, but I am afraid that I will have no happiness to enjoy after marriage in the future. So I could not wait, and bought half a dozen spermatorrhea medicines from a large pharmacy, thinking that I had spermatorrhea, and taking spermatorrhea medicines would of course be effective. I didn't know that after taking four boxes in a row, the symptoms remained the same. After taking half a dozen, the spermatorrhea did not get better, but instead caused headaches, brain swelling, and mental restlessness. In this situation, I really could not bear it, so I bought two boxes of "Hymitol's Sperm-Stabilizing Pills" and two boxes of "Gonadal Hormone" from Wuzhou, and took them at the same time according to the guidance of your publication, to see if they were effective? I knew that one attempt was beyond my expectations. After taking two boxes, the spermatorrhea had stopped, and after taking four more boxes, the spermatorrhea was also cured. Now I am strong and energetic, and my demeanor is free and easy. I have washed away the previous wilted state. In addition to being gratified, I recorded it to inform the fellow sufferers.</p>

<p>Although the war in Shanghai stopped the year before last, the social situation has not yet recovered. The "B", "C", and "D" defense lines in the concession are still guarded by foreign troops. Therefore, the members of the Volunteer Corps only replaced the British army in the "B" area for defense once in August. The remaining duties were only to assist the patrol or maintain the internal security of the concession at the request of the commanders of various defense zones. The corps was ordered to dispatch on the anniversaries of July 7, August 13, September 18, and October 10 last year due to the tense situation, assisting the patrol and foreign troops to prevent riots. The measures taken were quite effective.</p>
<p>The various teams of the Volunteer Corps gathered for exercises once a month, and resumed target practice shortly after the target range was opened. As a result of negotiations by the commander of the "A" defense zone, the road leading to the target range was opened from March 3, allowing members of the Volunteer Corps to pass.</p>
<p>Between June 13 and August 8, the patrol of the concession requested the Volunteer Corps to dispatch armored car teams to patrol south of the Suzhou River twice a week, from 5:30 pm to 11:00 pm.</p>
<p>The patrol of the Volunteer Corps has two types: armored car patrol and armed military vehicle patrol. The patrol and the commander of the "C" defense zone often request the Volunteer Corps to send armored cars to patrol within their jurisdiction to assist. The members of the Volunteer Corps on the armed military vehicles are more convenient for entertaining their duties when maintaining security. Therefore, these vehicles often depart with armored cars in order to suppress riots. The results are quite good. The effectiveness of armored cars has improved even more after the installation of wireless telephones. News broadcast by the patrol can be quickly transmitted to armored cars equipped with this type of telephone. Therefore, when needed, the members can immediately rush to the scene of the incident.</p>
<p>The training course of the Volunteer Corps has been completed in eight types. The commanders of the British and American defense forces stationed in Shanghai have strongly assisted in the training. The Volunteer Corps is very grateful.</p>
<p>The training of the Russian team is the same as in previous years. However, the training of newly recruited members is hindered due to the lack of available enemy troops. From August 12 to 14 last year, the team was ordered to carry out actual mobilization, and the results were of great benefit to the security of the concession. On weekdays, the team cooperated with the patrol from time to time to carry out duties such as suppression, search, and guard. The team members have good discipline and good health, which is very satisfactory. The accommodation problem of the team will be a lot of consideration in the future. Now the members are divided into two houses owned by the Chinese government, which is not very economical. The total number of members of the Volunteer Corps increased by 54 last year. The most members are now British, except for the Russian team, followed by Russian, Chinese, American, Portuguese, and Japanese. Around the anniversary of August 13 last year, three teams were fully mobilized.</p>
<p>The defense of the "B" defense zone has been taken over by the British army. At the same time, the Russian team of the Volunteer Corps has a specialized duty. Therefore, all the military vehicles of the team have been temporarily reduced by two. Some of the vehicles are too old and will need to be replaced in the future.</p>
<p>All rifles have been improved and are stored in the headquarters. All machine guns stored in the headquarters are good.</p>
<p>There are many members who have to retire due to their high age this year. Therefore, the commander of the team has paid attention to the recruitment problem.</p>
<p>Last year, the Volunteer Corps coordinated with foreign troops and the patrol to maintain security, making the situation in the concession more peaceful. Therefore, the value of its service cannot be obliterated. It can be asserted that this kind of service will still be needed in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Japanese Side Receives Foreign Journalists; Answers Are Vague; All Answered with "No News" <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reported that at yesterday's (27th) reception for journalists by the Japanese side, the journalists asked various questions, and the answers received were all "no news." Regarding the rumors that "Shao Lizi" was kidnapped by the Japanese in the public concession, the spokesperson replied, no news. Whether the Panamanian ship Yongda, which was detained in Qingdao on December 31 last year, will be released tomorrow, the spokesperson again replied no news. It is rumored in this port that guerrillas captured the village chief in Weihaiwei to prevent them from assisting the Japanese army in recruiting Chinese people. The spokesperson also replied no news. The journalist asked again whether the Japanese military special affairs department would be taken over by the Asia Development Board. The spokesperson replied maybe yes, maybe no. The journalist also asked why Chinese people were blocked at the bridgehead and searched when entering and leaving Hongkou, causing traffic jams for up to 20 minutes. The spokesperson Zhu did not answer, and finally said that it was because leaflets about the anniversary of the January 28 Incident were distributed on the south bank of the Suzhou River, so preventive measures were taken.</p>

<p>Cheng Ying, a woman from Changshu, is 25 years old. She received higher education and graduated from Cihang Midwifery School. She was previously married to Dr. Wei Guangcai. The wedding hall was set up in the New Hotel on Erma Road, and their cohabitation location was at No. 14 Fude Lane, Hed Road. Unexpectedly, the marriage was short-lived, and they divorced. Cheng then published an advertisement for marriage on a local newspaper on September 6 and 7 of the year before last. The only qualification was that the man could bear the economic burden. At that time, Zhao Liyuan, a native of Jiangyin, owner of Liyuan Well Company at No. 596 Haifang Road, went to apply.</p>
<p>After negotiation, it was considered that he met the qualifications, so they began to cohabit. Unexpectedly, after more than a year of cohabitation, a rift suddenly arose. Recently, Cheng suddenly hired lawyer Shen Yiqian to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special Court against Zhao Liyuan, accusing him of using fraud to entice her to rape, injure her body, and impede her freedom, etc. The Special Court has already interrogated him once, and the defendant has also hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to appear in court on his behalf. The court ordered that the trial be rescheduled. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case was continued in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning by Judge Xiao Peishen. The plaintiff invited the same</p>
<p>witness to court</p>
<p>to prove that the defendant had injured her. The defendant completely denied all the accusations made by the plaintiff and stated that this matter was not an enticement of the defendant, but a solicitation by the defendant in response to the newspaper advertisement, so the defendant was actually a deceived person. His representative lawyer Shen Ronghua submitted small newspapers such as "Holmes" and "Diamond", and the plaintiff and Dr. Wei Guangcai's</p>
<p>wedding photo</p>
<p>to the court. The small newspapers contained mostly various scandals about Cheng Ying in the past, which are too numerous to mention. The most notable of them was the incident of Tao Jianhua, the former intelligence section chief of the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently the inspector general of the Jiangsu Anti-Smoking Bureau, encountering a female con artist Cheng Yanbai escaping. It is recorded as follows, saying that Yanbai's original name was Cheng Ying, and she used aliases such as Cheng Ying, Ru, Tongyun, etc., more than ten in total, and</p>
<p>she was already 29 years old</p>
<p>She had relationships with Xu, the secretary of the Jiangxi Civil Affairs Department, Liang, the president of the court, Wu, the magistrate of Xingzi County, and Lu, the staff officer of the Fujian Pacification Park. She also worked as a mistress three times in Shanghai. Marrying Tao Jianhua was her ninth husband. Later, Cheng took Tao's marriage certificate and jewelry and fled Shanghai on the 15th, and married Dr. Wei Guangcai at the New Hotel on the 20th. After Tao reported to</p>
<p>the authorities,</p>
<p>it was found that Cheng had fled with property. He negotiated with Cheng, but Cheng took the marriage certificate and suitcase and escaped again. Later, Wei found Cheng at the Ningbo Merchants Hotel on Tianjin Road and twisted her into the patrol, and Cheng handed over the marriage certificate and other items. Then, she divorced Wei, etc. The defendant's lawyer stated that this evidence was delivered to our lawyer's office by someone during the rescheduling. He requested an inquiry. Judge Xiao then asked the plaintiff, how many times</p>
<p>have you been married?</p>
<p>Cheng admitted that she had married Wei Guangcai once, and denied the rest. Later, because Wei committed a criminal case, she broke away from him, etc. The court stated that the case was clear and ordered the debate to begin. After the plaintiff and defendant lawyers debated each other, the court ordered that the verdict be announced at a later date. It is also heard that the defendant will also file a lawsuit against Cheng Ying.</p>

<p>The shantytowns in western Shanghai are where common people live. Recently, fires have been heard from time to time. At 12:20 noon yesterday, a fire was reported in the thatched cottages near the Tokyo Road and Jilao Road in western Shanghai's Public Concession, and several people were burned to death. The situation was very tragic. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire</p>
<p>There are more than a hundred thatched cottages there. At noon yesterday, one of the shacks accidentally started a fire while cooking lunch, causing a single spark to start a prairie fire. At that time, due to the oblique wind and drizzle, the flames became even fiercer. The residents there supported the old and helped the young, weeping and wailing. Later, the Central Fire Department was notified and immediately dispatched six fire trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Because the thatched cottages there were close together, it was difficult to put out the fire. It took more than two hours to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that more than a hundred thatched cottages were burned down.</p>
<p>Many People Burned to Death</p>
<p>Due to the narrow paths in and out of the houses, even though the fire broke out during the day, several people were still buried in the fire. The firemen found the bodies of a boy and a girl. In addition, there were two bodies, which were charred and unidentifiable. In addition, women Lin Chen (56 years old) and Wu Lin (34 years old) were burned in the head, face, and hands and were sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment by car. As for whether there are any other people buried in the fire, the digging was still continuing last night. As for the victims, they were still standing outside the fire scene, in dire need of relief.</p>

<p>Personnel from the Public Concession Patrol discovered a dyeing workshop that counterfeited cigarettes produced by the British American Tobacco Company on Wuding Road on New Year's Day this month, and arrested 25 bandits on the spot. More than one million counterfeit Great Britain, Pin Hai, and Old Dao brand cigarettes were found in the counterfeit factory. All the bandits have been detained in the Central Patrol for a long time. The First Special District Court has now sentenced eight of them to six months in prison, and some have been fined from 30 to 300 yuan. It is heard that the Public Concession has been paying attention to the counterfeit cigarette factory for several years, and it was only cracked during the New Year's holiday this year.</p>

<h3 id="e73">1938 Labor Report of the Public Works Bureau (Continued) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Wage Changes Before and After August 13th) Based on the two tables above, comparing the wage situation of various industries before and after the war, the post-war wages are obviously lower than the pre-war wages. This decline is even more significant in actual income figures. The underwear, enamel, and hosiery industries suffered the most severe wage reductions after the war. On the one hand, it was due to transportation blockades and a sharp decline in sales in the inland areas. On the other hand, because most of the larger factories in these industries were shut down after the war, and the remaining smaller factories had originally lower wages. A few industries, however, experienced wage increases after the war. For example, the hourly wage rate in the cotton spinning industry was 3.9 cents in the 25th year, and the actual monthly income was 10.05 yuan in the 25th year and 13.3 yuan in the 27th year. The increase was due to the sharp increase in the population of Shanghai and the urgent need for cotton textiles, which led to the booming of the yarn industry and increased employment of skilled workers, thus increasing wages. At the same time, the manipulation and price increases in the cotton spinning market caused yarn prices to soar, which undoubtedly had an impact. The wages in the silk and cotton weaving industries also increased. The increase was actually due to the booming of the silk and cotton weaving industries in the months before the war, when there were many requests for wage increases. Although affected by the war, the wages had already increased. In the 27th year, there was a slight decline, but due to the increase in population and the wide range of clothing uses, the wages were still higher than in the 25th year. The reeling industry was severely affected by the outbreak of the war. Most of the industry fell into the war zone, and the remaining factories were sometimes operating and sometimes suspended. However, due to the gradual increase in exports after the war, the reduction in output, the high price of silk, the business gradually became active, and the wages also returned to the old view. Recently, due to the lack of skilled workers, factories are competing to attract them with high wages, and wages are becoming more and more high. The wages in the flour industry have always been calculated on a monthly basis, so there were no major changes before and after the war. As for the oil pressing and paper making industries, the oil pressing industries that started after the war had more than enough power. Only two companies, Dade and Xin, were in operation. Only one paper making company, Jingcheng, was in operation. Since the scope of the investigation was not widespread, it was difficult to compare with the pre-war figures. Although there were gains and losses, it was not enough to be used as a conclusion.</p>
<p>(Daily Working Hours) In the following table, each industry is arranged according to the average actual daily working hours. The longest working hours are in the cotton spinning, flour, cotton weaving, oil pressing, and paper making industries, which work between 11 and 12 hours a day. The working hours in the tobacco and match industries are shorter, between 6.5 and 8.5 hours. It is worth noting that the cotton spinning, flour, cotton weaving, and silk reeling industries have the lowest wage rates and the longest working hours. With long hours and low pay, the situation of the workers in these industries can be imagined. The length of working hours changes with the prosperity and decline of business. During the period from the 20th to the 24th year, when industry and commerce were in decline, all industries experienced extreme difficulties. Therefore, they reduced work and restricted exports. This situation had a significant impact on working hours, especially for piecework. Piecework is paid according to the amount of output. In an environment of industrial decline, piecework is the first to be affected by reduced work opportunities, so the change in working hours for piecework is more drastic than that for hourly work. In industries that employ a large number of pieceworkers, the average working hours are often shorter than those in industries that employ hourly workers.</p>
<p>(Monthly Working Days) Among the various industries, the flour industry has the most average working days per month, with 29 days per month, and the oil pressing industry has 28 days per month. There is almost no time to rest in a month. The silk reeling, hosiery, machinery, tobacco, and printing industries have fewer working days, with between 18 and 26 days per month. In some industries, especially in matches, tobacco, and silk reeling, the number of working days in each month varies greatly. Changes in weather and shortages of raw materials are the main reasons for the intermittent work. Since the work is not fixed, the income is also fluctuating, and the lives of workers cannot have a fixed guarantee. In theory, the daily output can be adjusted. This is a matter of factory management. If there is intermittent work, the factory authorities cannot shirk their responsibility. The number of working days in the 27th year of the Republic of China has increased significantly compared with the previous year, which is enough to indicate that the Shanghai market has experienced abnormal development after the war. In the silk reeling industry, the actual income of workers in the 26th year was an unprecedented low.</p>
<p>(Trend of Real Wages) The real wage index can show the actual situation of workers' lives. If income increases and living expenses decrease, then life is comfortable. Conversely, life is difficult. Therefore, the quality of workers' lives depends on the degree of rise and fall of both. In the 26th year, the actual income index fell sharply, and living expenses rose sharply. The two went in opposite directions, and the real wage fell from 103.96 to 81.27. In the 27th year, although the actual income increased slightly, the situation did not improve. The living expenses index suddenly increased from 106.27 to 137.51. The real wage continued to fall to 62.81. From the rise and fall of the real wage index above, we can see a glimpse of the difficult life of workers during the war. (End)</p>

<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Wang Xiaolai, in response to the call of the central government, went to Yunnan, Chongqing, and other areas via Hong Kong to inspect industries. In the middle of this month, the inspection was completed and they returned to Hong Kong from Hanoi. According to Mr. Du, who told the Hong Kong-based reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency, the impressions gained from this trip to the west were excellent. The authorities were able to devote themselves to construction projects during the war, and various light and heavy industries had been moved to safe locations to continue their production work. This kind of place can especially show the great spirit of perseverance and hard work of our people. Mr. Du expressed his respect for the current Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Weng Wenhao, saying that Mr. Weng was able to use pure scientific management methods to enable Chinese industry to quickly embark on a new track and establish a new system from the collapse. This could not be achieved without great intelligence and agile means. Mr. Du also said that the rich resources of northwestern and southwestern China, with a little development, would be sufficient to support the long-term war of resistance. The central government has a complete plan for developing the economy of the southwest, and the northwest is also in the planning stage. Finally, Mr. Du said that he would return to Hong Kong to communicate with overseas Chinese and encourage them to invest in various industries.</p>

<p>The British-owned gas company, due to soaring coal prices, successively raised prices by 18% in January and August of last year. In November, it once again petitioned the Public Works Bureau to increase the surcharges according to the exchange rate between the legal currency and the British gold. After deliberation by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau, it was recommended to the Board of Directors to increase the surcharge to 23%. The company notified users one month in advance and implemented it for three months. By the end of April, the Public Works Bureau would consider handling it. Now the company has sent letters to all users in the city, stipulating that the price increase will be implemented from February 15th, and the additional fee of 23% will be charged according to the table and the original price.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Shanghai Special: On the Remittance System (Continued) <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yu</p>
<p>3. Calculation of External Digging and Internal Deduction</p>
<p>As for the source of cash for the new agency specializing in remittance and discounting, a small part is purchased sporadically from merchants with remittance bills, and a large part is purchased from peers or banks. The general calculation method is external digging and internal deduction. Here are a few examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>Example 1: Merchant A purchases 10,000 yuan in cash from peer merchant B. Suppose the market price on that day is 45 yuan, then A will issue a remittance bill with a face value of 10,450 yuan to B, and the additional 450 yuan is the remittance fee. The calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Example 2: Suppose customer C discounts a remittance bill with a face value of 10,000 yuan at A, then according to the market price on that day, A pays B 9,550 yuan in cash, and the deducted 450 yuan is the cash discount. The calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Example 3: Suppose customer D purchases a remittance of 10,000 yuan from A with cash. According to the market price on that day, 9,570.25 yuan in cash should be paid. The calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>The calculation of remittance and discounting is generally no more than the above three methods. If readers carefully calculate the above three formulas, they will know the mutual conversion relationship between buying and selling at the same market price. Furthermore, the discount market price has no fixed standard. It is inevitable that operators will deliberately increase or decrease it in order to increase profits. The Joint Reserve Committee of Banks in Shanghai has come forward to maintain the market price and limit the size of the discount in order to regulate the market. However, the above-mentioned drawbacks are still unavoidable. Generally speaking, the market price of banks or money exchange shops with larger scale, longer history, and discounting as a concurrent business is more accurate, and the profit taken is also smaller. As for the others, it is beyond description. However, the daily market price is unpredictable, and there is little guarantee for the reliability of the bill. Therefore, it is not easy to operate this industry. The discount of each bank and shop must be slightly higher than the prescribed discount rate, probably for this reason.</p>
<p>4. Prospects for Remittance and Discounting</p>
<p>Recently, some people in the society have advocated the abolition of remittance bills, believing that this non-convertible bill is detrimental to all sectors of industry and commerce. However, everyone knows that remittance bills are a product of the post-war era and have a related relationship with the restricted deposit and withdrawal system. If they are fundamentally abolished, they will conflict with the financial stability measures of the Ministry of Finance. Most of the deposit balances of the banks will stagnate and become useless, and there will be a shortage of chips in the market. Taking a step back, if all these remittance bills are changed to checks, it will contradict the government's fundamental goal of stabilizing finance. Therefore, from the standpoint of wartime finance, this bill must continue to circulate in the market. The reasons are threefold:</p>
<p>1. To prevent a part of the funds from being converted into foreign exchange and reduce the fluctuations in the foreign exchange market, which has a close relationship with the implementation of foreign exchange control.</p>
<p>2. To reduce the amount of legal currency needed and avoid a large amount of cash flowing into the hands of traitors or the enemy to disrupt China's wartime finance.</p>
<p>3. To stabilize the foundation of the banking industry, so that commercial banks can adjust their deposit and lending business during the war, and the risk of deposit and withdrawal can be avoided.</p>
<p>Even more, for a year, remittance bills have been proven by facts to be able to be used as trading chips, so remittance transactions are only a procedure between banks and money shops, and there is no inconvenience to the depositors themselves. What is lost is only a discounting system that has emerged in Shanghai under abnormally developed conditions. If all sectors do not need cash, then there is still no loss to speak of. Even if this type of remittance bill is used for payment, the price may be discounted in certain transactions, but it is only a minimum amount and has no major impact on the overall finance. On the other hand, we can take this opportunity to cultivate our people's habit of using bills and have a considerable understanding of bills, so that our country's industry and commerce can reach another new stage. Therefore, losing a horse may not be a blessing in disguise. If the banks and money shops in this city come forward to negotiate the abolition of the discounting system, or impose strict restrictions on the discount rate, it will be even more beneficial to stabilizing the financial market. In short, this method was designed to cope with the wartime environment, so it can be abolished invisibly when the war ends. At the same time, the non-convertibility of today is also a temporary state. We don't need to worry about it and make a fuss about nothing. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Case of German-Jewish Man Violating Chinese Woman <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>High Court Second Branch Opens Trial Tomorrow</p>
<p>C. Brahn, a 52-year-old German Jew and representative of the German Golden Chemical Society in Shanghai, currently residing at No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, on the pretext of hiring a Chinese language teacher last summer, lured Shi Limi (19 years old this year), the daughter of Shi Hua, a Wuxi woman currently residing at No. 1346 Yuyuan Road, to his residence for sexual intercourse. A Korean woman was his assistant, causing Shi Limi to be unable to resist. Later, Brahn gave Shi Limi a check for 1,000 yuan, instructing her</p>
<p>not to make a fuss.</p>
<p>After being violated, Shi Limi became pregnant. Brahn, together with Huang Cheng, a Fujianese doctor of Western medicine residing at No. [illegible] Lane 30 Ximo Road, jointly instigated Shi Limi to have an abortion. Later, Shi Hua discovered it and Shi Limi revealed the previous situation. The mother and daughter then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the criminal court of the First Special District Court, accusing Brahn and Huang Cheng of disrupting the family and instigating abortion. The defendant Brahn confessed to the sexual intercourse and said</p>
<p>continuous sexual intercourse</p>
<p>had been going on for two years. After the preliminary trial, Judge Xiao Xiefen acquitted Brahn and Huang Cheng. Shi Limi and Shi Hua refused to accept the judgment and hired a lawyer Wei Wenhan to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The reason for their appeal was "For the case of suing the defendants for disrupting the family and instigating abortion, supplementary reasons are provided. According to the case, the first defendant Brahn intended to commit sexual intercourse and used money as a method of inducement to have a relationship with the first appellant. The first instance has already admitted in court that</p>
<p>pregnancy due to sexual intercourse</p>
<p>is also an undisputed fact by the appellees, and also caused the first appellant to leave the family, which constitutes a crime under Article 241, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After the first appellant discovered that she was pregnant and told the first appellee, he, in order to avoid responsibility, instigated the first appellant to have an abortion, threatening her with the reputation at stake and promising money as bait. The second appellee examined and designed the abortion. Between August 10th and 20th of the 27th year, the first appellee took her to the address of the second appellee, and the second appellee gave her abortion</p>
<p>black pills</p>
<p>twelve pills, and instructed her</p>
<p>to take one pill each time</p>
<p>three times a day, and to finish them in four days. When there was no effect, the second appellee performed an injection procedure, one injection every other day. After three injections, there was still no effect. The first appellee asked the second appellee to ask the German doctor Shoushibo to check and determine a date to proceed with the abortion procedure. The above facts, in addition to the statements made by the first and second appellees in court, are also evidenced by the documents presented to the court. Later, because the first appellant was</p>
<p>timid about the procedure</p>
<p>and dared not go, she finally dared not go despite the urging of the first appellee. The first instance confused the actions of the second appellee with the actions of Shoushibo, and concluded that it was only a preparatory act and could not be considered a crime. According to the unconsummated crime, it refers to starting to commit a crime but not succeeding, or not producing the result of a crime. The so-called start refers to the fact that the intention to commit a crime has not reached the degree of consummation. This is clearly stipulated in the precedent of the Supreme Court. The second appellee in this case</p>
<p>had an abortion</p>
<p>by giving the first appellant pills and performing injections. The act of committing the crime had already begun, which is very obvious. Furthermore, the preparatory act is the preparatory act before the start. The second appellee in this case has already started the act of committing a crime, only without the result of a crime. Therefore, the second appellee is undoubtedly guilty of attempted abortion. The first instance considered it to be only a preparatory act, which is completely inconsistent with</p>
<p>the facts and connections.</p>
<p>It is really inappropriate to suddenly declare the appellants not guilty. Furthermore, when the first instance was reviewing the case, the court announced that it had not questioned the facts of the second appellee in detail, such as (1) What illness did the first appellee introduce to see the doctor? (2) What illness did the second appellee's black medicine treat? (3) Whether the first appellant had an illness, whether the uterine disease was related to the facts of the crime were not questioned, causing the appellees to</p>
<p>get away with it.</p>
<p>We are really not satisfied. Therefore, we respectfully ask your court to summon the appellees to court for detailed questioning, and to make a fair judgment based on the facts and the law, which is really virtuous. We respectfully submit this to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court." According to the statement, the Second Branch of the High Court has scheduled the trial for 3 pm tomorrow (the 31st). It is hoped that this lawsuit involving a German-Jewish man violating a Chinese woman can obtain a fair trial in the near future.</p>

<p>Handed Over to the Court to Await the Arrest of Accomplices for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>In the French Concession, at the tram and bus stops on Nanyang Bridge, Dongxin Bridge Street, and Aiduya Road, Baxian Bridge, etc., there were often rogue bandits snatching passengers' hats. There were also guests carrying luggage on rickshaws whose hats (commonly called "flying palace") were snatched. It turned out that a certain inspector of the French Police Department also had a silk velvet hat worth more than 40 yuan snatched from him while passing the intersection of Ximen Road and Wangzhi Road in a rickshaw last month. Therefore, he ordered all patrol officers to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Now, detective Sui Wenzhi discovered that a large group of hat-snatching bandits were hiding in No. 146 Pingjili Road. So, he secretly went there the night before and arrested Wang A'er, Zhang Liansheng, Xu Decai, Zhang Jinsheng, Wu Xiaomao, Wan Gensheng, Zhou Jisheng, Huang Lianjiang, He Houcai, Zhang Wanchun, Lin Xiaogou, Liu Haiming, Li Jinshun, Huang Meisheng, Dong Xichang, Yu Caigui, Bian Yousheng, Li Qinghe, and other eighteen people, and found more than a dozen stolen hats, which were taken to the police station together. The day before yesterday, they were handed over to the Second Special Court, requesting detention and investigation to arrest the accomplices who were still at large. After Judge Liao took his seat in the Criminal Division One and interrogated them, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to February 9th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Hengxi Ship Escapes Danger and Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Two Salted Meat Junks Were Stolen and Plundered</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News reported that the German ship Hengxi encountered pirates near Zhanghuang Port on the north bank of the Yangtze River on Friday (the 27th). Because a certain Japanese small destroyer patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River received the news, it fired machine guns and turned on searchlights, so it was not plundered. The pirates were estimated to be more than fifty people, traveling in several junks, but they did not escape empty-handed. Two large junks fully loaded with salted meat were seized by the pirates and their whereabouts are unknown. The salted meat in the ships was originally scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai and was worth about 10,000 yuan. The Hengxi ship returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, carrying chickens, pigs, and other items. The Chinese crew members and passengers who were kidnapped and escaped told about what happened: that night, around 9 o'clock, the Hengxi ship was berthed at Zhanghuang Port, waiting for merchants in the area to load goods. The passengers of the ship who landed at Zhanghuang Port saw many junks in the darkness, and the people in the junks were carrying rifles and other weapons, so they believed they were pirates. When they saw the people in the junks ordering two junks full of salted meat to stop, they were even more convinced. They shouted loudly that they had encountered pirates. A certain Japanese destroyer that was not far from the Hengxi ship heard the news and immediately fired machine guns and turned on searchlights. The pirates fled. It seemed quite fast. In the rush, they were unable to board the Hengxi ship and carry out a large-scale looting. According to several passengers, there were six people dressed as workers who did not carry weapons and boarded the Hengxi ship from a junk, persuading the passengers on the ship to leave the ship. At that time, they suspected that these six people might be disguised as pirates, luring passengers to leave the ship and go to the ferry so that the pirates could search and loot more easily. It is reported that the Hengxi ship has encountered bad luck several times. At the beginning of last week, when it had just set sail from Shanghai, three armed bandits boarded the ship and went straight to the comprador's office, robbing more than 2,000 yuan in banknotes. The three thieves are still at large.</p>

Mr. He was a rare talent among Chinese physicists. He was born in 1882 and graduated from the Normal College of the Capital University and the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. After returning to China, he successively served as a teacher at the Capital University, the head and professor of the Physics Department of National Peking University, a lecturer at Beijing Normal University, and the head and professor of the Physics Department of Northeastern University. Today's scientific foundation in Chinese physics is due to Mr. He's contributions. In terms of translation, he wrote books such as "The Mechanism of Nature." When Yu Feipeng was the Minister of Communications, Mr. He served as an advisor to the ministry. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he worked too hard in Beijing, and his old illness recurred from time to time. After the National Government moved west, he also went to Chongqing. On January 17th, his old heart disease suddenly relapsed, and he died despite medical treatment at the age of 57. His relatives and friends in Chongqing, Chen Bulei, Hu Liangzhen, Hong Lingxi, and Mr. He's family decided to temporarily place the coffin in the Zhejiang Pavilion in Jiangbei County. Mr. He had good friends and students all over the country, and those who heard the news expressed their condolences, and believed that it was a major loss of talent for Chinese physics.</p>

<p>Mr. Qian Xuanqing, a senior gentleman of Songjiang, had been living in Feifang, Betijiao Road in this city since the outbreak of the war. Recently, his old hernia illness worsened and he sought treatment at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital, but to no avail. He passed away in the hospital on the 27th of this month. The funeral will be held at 3 pm on the 30th at the Shanghai Funeral Home in Fenglinqiao. Mr. Qian was a prominent family in Songjiang, a former scholar of the Qing Dynasty, and was respected by society for his morality and writing. He was 64 years old. He was usually enthusiastic about public welfare and charitable. He devoted himself to local charitable undertakings. He was elected as a standing supervisor of the Songjiang Red Cross Society. Since the outbreak of the Jiangzhe War in Jiazi, Songjiang has repeatedly suffered from war disasters. The local Red Cross Society has been handling the relief work of receiving refugees, and Mr. Qian has always generously donated money to promote it. Especially after the outbreak of the August 13th war, Songjiang was adjacent to the coast of Shanghai, and refugees gathered there for a while, numbering in the tens of thousands. Mr. Qian assisted the Songjiang Red Cross Society in raising funds, setting up a large number of shelters, and comforting the displaced people, which was not a small feat. Upon hearing of his death, everyone expressed their condolences.</p>

<p>Since Madame Curie of France discovered that the main component of mineral spring water is radium, scientists have developed Radigam Emanator tablets, which allow people to produce radium water of unparalleled value at home. These radium emanation tablets have small holes and contain radium salts that do not dissolve in water. To make radium water, simply immerse the tablet in plain boiled water. After twelve hours, it can be taken for drinking, and then immersed again for continued use. It is inexhaustible and truly the most economical natural tonic. Radium water is effective in treating rheumatism, rheumatic bone pain, headaches, neuralgia, lumbago, neuritis, sexual neurasthenia, premature aging, constipation, indigestion, insomnia and other ailments, and its efficacy far exceeds that of mineral spring water. Doctors in major hospitals are happy to use it. It is said that the general manager of the local branch is China Electrotherapy Company at 770 Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 33837. Explanations and written requests will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Hunan University Moves to Chenxi <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Teachers and Students Exert Much Effort</p>
<p>(Changsha Dispatch) Hunan University suffered a raid by 27 Japanese aircraft on April 10th last year. Staff and students were killed or injured, dormitories collapsed, the science building was half destroyed, and the library was completely destroyed. For a time, the school was in chaos, and it was extremely shocking. Fortunately, with the encouragement of the entire faculty and students and the efforts of the authorities, classes resumed immediately after only a week of suspension. Later, as the war became increasingly tense, Changsha was subject to frequent air raids, and schools at all levels in the provincial capital successively retreated to the countryside. For the sake of teaching safety, Hunan University had to deliberate on setting up a branch campus. Initially, they planned to set up a branch campus in Zhijiang and sent personnel to negotiate with three local schools to rent all the school buildings originally rented by a certain school, which could accommodate approximately 400-500 students. Unexpectedly, it was abandoned midway, and they had no choice but to move to a more remote location with fifty or sixty civilian houses, which could at most accommodate just over 200 people. However, the total number of new and old students at Hunan University exceeded 700, and with faculty, staff and workers, it would be no less than 900 people, which was insufficient. Therefore, they hesitated to make a decision. Fortunately, Minister Chen visited the school in August and instructed them to build temporary school buildings. Therefore, the school officials proceeded with renting or buying the houses on one hand and began preparing for construction on the other. Since October, the entire school has been mobilized and has been exceptionally busy. Books, instruments and school supplies have been shipped in batches, and the faculty and students gathered in Chenxi at the end of October and officially began working on November 1st, immediately opening registration and starting classes.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Guangdong East High School Adds a Senior Commercial Course <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong East High School (formerly known as Guangzhao High School) in Shanghai was founded by the current principal, Lu Songqian. It has a long history and an excellent reputation. After the August 13th Incident, the magnificent school buildings it had built on Shuidao Road were destroyed by the fires of war, and it moved to a temporary location at 629 Seymour Road (near Xin Zha Road). It has persevered and continued to work hard, and student performance has generally been better than before. Recently, due to the increasing number of students and the insufficient number of classrooms, it has expanded the school buildings by adding adjacent school buildings to increase the number of students. At the same time, it has increased the facilities for physical education and natural sciences in order to achieve its educational goals. In order to meet the needs of the times, it has added a senior commercial course starting in the spring of the 28th year, first enrolling one class each for the upper and lower semesters of the first year. It has hired Mr. Huang Peiqi, a bachelor of commerce from Columbia University in the United States, as the dean of academic affairs, and Mr. Li Bingyu, a master of commerce from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, as well as domestic well-known university graduates with teaching experience, as teachers. It has also hired business leaders as consultants to gather wisdom and create talents that meet the needs of the times. The school has close ties with major companies and banks in Shanghai, and graduates with excellent grades do not need to worry about finding suitable jobs, as the school is responsible for finding them employment. The school's general courses for senior and junior high schools and senior commercial courses are scheduled to recruit new students on February 3rd. It is said that the number of applicants has been extremely high recently. Those with formal credentials who pass the review may be exempted from part or all of the examination.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Achievements of the Chemical Engineering Department of Suzhou High School <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Seven years ago, Suzhou High School, in view of the extremely urgent need for chemical engineering talents in the domestic industrial sector, took the lead in the education sector of this province to establish a chemical engineering department to cultivate chemical engineering talents and established the Suzhou High School Chemical Factory to provide practical training. All products, such as soap, leather, paint, etc., are quite popular with society. They have been expanding their efforts and working hard year by year, and have made remarkable achievements. To date, there have been three graduating classes, and a large number of graduates are serving in the chemical industry both locally and abroad. The famous chemical factories in Shanghai, such as Tianli Ammonia Factory, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory, China Vegetable Oil Factory, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhenhua Paint Factory. Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, Guben Soap Factory, and Dazhong Dye Factory, as well as the largest-scale Tianjin Yongli Alkali Factory, and the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Factory in Liuhe County, which had just been completed and put into operation before the incident, and the Yongming Paint Factory in Peiping, all have graduates serving there, with excellent performance and the full trust of the factory. Therefore, each class of students is hired in advance by various factories when they are about to graduate, and there is a great shortage of supply, which shows that the school's training is effective and the equipment is complete. It is also conceivable that the industry has a great need for such talents. As for the graduates who have continued to study chemical engineering theory in pursuit of further education and have been admitted to Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, Central University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, and the Chemical Engineering Research Institute, there are also many, and their achievements are excellent. Since the school resumed operations in Shanghai last year, it has been actively preparing to restore the department. It is now heard that preparations are in place, and the student internship method has been agreed upon with several major factories in Shanghai.

<p>Pudong High School was founded in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty by Mr. Sheng from Chuansha. The original school building was located at Liuli Bridge in Pudong, covering an area of over 40 acres. The school building was grand, the equipment was perfect, and the history was long. Talented people emerged in large numbers, and it was known as one of the four famous middle schools in this city. During the August 13th War of Resistance, the school was located in the war zone, and the entire school building was destroyed. Subsequently, it was moved to a large building at 13 Avenue Dubail, French Concession, to continue its schooling. Principal Wang Manyun, Dean of Academic Affairs Zhang Jiashou, Dean of Student Affairs Fan Gongren, Director of General Affairs Hu Gengchu, and teachers Huang Jingxian, Huang Keren, Yao Renyan, and Li Tianxing have all been serving in the education field for many years. Their academic background and experience are superior to ordinary people. There are currently more than 300 senior and junior high school students in seven grades, attending full-day classes. The curriculum of each grade is implemented in accordance with the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, with reference to the actual situation. Emphasis is placed on Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and the number of hours is specially increased each week, so that graduates are convenient for both further education and employment. Teaching is usually very serious, and guidance is absolutely strict. In terms of equipment, after successive additions over the past year, it has also been considerably enriched. All scientific instruments, Chinese and Western paintings have dedicated rooms to facilitate teaching.</p>

<h3 id="e96">West Union First Division Football Match: Tung Wah Loses Two Matches to Western Capture <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>One to Three... First Half Zero to One</p>
<p>The West Union First Division football match between Tung Wah and Western Capture was held yesterday morning at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground despite the rain. The audience was deterred by the rain, totaling less than 400 people. The ball was heavy and the ground slippery, but the competition was quite fierce. Tung Wah's offense was strong, but their luck was not good, and they lost the first half by a small margin of zero to one. After the break, Western Capture became more and more courageous. After Living-stone scored a goal, Sun Huizhang pulled one back. Finally, Whiswood scored another goal. As a result, Western Capture won by three to one. In the afternoon, other matches such as the Chinese YMCA Cup, Lido vs. Yuanchang, etc., were not played due to rain.</p>
<p>Western Capture Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Western Capture kicked off and was blocked. Tung Wah penetrated twice from the right, but both failed. Wu Binghao tried a shot, which went wide. Then Willie Watert touched the ball outside the penalty area and was penalized with a free kick. A. Dae rushed it too quickly, and the ball flew out of bounds. Western Capture continuously took corner kicks, but without success. Tung Wah kicked the ball far forward. A. Dae took the opportunity to rush in and shoot with all his might, but missed the goal, which was a pity. Not long after, Western Capture was awarded a free kick just outside Tung Wah's penalty area. Xu Tu took the kick, and Zhou Dayun deflected it into a corner kick. Livingstone crossed the ball, but was saved by Dayun again. After 20 minutes, Livingstone passed to Hutley, who passed it to the center. Xu Tu fouled in the forward area, and Western Capture took the lead by one goal. Tung Wah vowed to counterattack. Wu Binghao received a pass from A. Dae. Jebson came out to block, and Wu shot hastily, going high over the crossbar. Western Capture attacked. Greenburg hooked a shot from 20 yards, which was extremely fast and dangerous. Dayun held it down. Tung Wah's Shen Shiyan dribbled the ball and rushed forward, but was blocked and fell to the ground. Jia Youliang rushed to pick up the ball, and A. Dae shot at the goal, forcing a corner kick. Jia's cross was excellent. Sun Huizhang headed the ball, but it was saved again. Western Capture thus led by one to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Unluckily Defeated</p>
<p>The second half began, and Western Capture changed its lineup. Victor was moved to the back, Pate took the position of right inside forward, and Jebson became the left midfielder. After this adjustment, their momentum became even stronger. Livingstone's shot was caught. Pate then chipped the ball, which landed by the goal. Zhou Dayun was blocked and unable to save it. Fortunately, Jiang Zhaoxiang rushed back and kicked the ball out, averting the danger. Not long after, Hutley received a short pass from Pate and swept the ball sideways. Dai Yun caught it. Hu then launched a long shot, which was saved again. Tung Wah was in a dangerous situation and urgently launched an offensive. A. Dae single-handedly charged straight into the enemy's territory, but Sun Huizhang was offside and the attempt was ruled out. Instead, Livingstone scored a goal with a long shot from Hutley, 20 minutes into the second half. Tung Wah counterattacked. Sun Huizhang and Wu Binghao advanced side by side. Wu's shot went wide. After 28 minutes, Jia Youliang hooked the ball, and Watert failed to catch it. The ball landed in the goal area. Whiswood tried to kick it but failed. Sun Huizhang rushed up and poked the ball in, and the ball went into the net. Tung Wah pulled back one goal, but not a minute later, after Hutley's corner kick was punched out by Zhou, he got another corner kick opportunity. Hu crossed the ball perfectly, and Whiswood was in the right position and scored with one kick. Tung Wah's fate was sealed, and they were defeated by three to one.</p>

Wang Zuyi pulled back one goal. Then K. Xu scored twice. Fuen and McKellar continued to score. In the first half, St. Francis won by a large margin of seven to one. After the break, Zhendan was even more unable to support themselves, and their goal was wide open. Hu Erfei became the target of everyone's attacks. Zhendan had a penalty kick opportunity, but Zhang Susheng missed it. When the St. Francis team took the lead by twelve to one, Zhendan began with Lin Jianpeng scoring a goal.

<p>The All-Shanghai Women's Table Tennis Championship, organized by the Women's Christian Association, began its second week of knockout matches at 2:00 PM yesterday in the Association's auditorium. Rong Mozhen, Yuan Lianru, and others successively advanced. The match between Xu Haili and Feng Mingyu was not played because Feng Mingyu was late. The Competition Committee did not order a make-up match and decided that both players would advance at the same time, which violated the competition rules and was inappropriate. It was also unfair to those who were eliminated. Currently, there are a total of 11 participants in the round-robin stage, including Liang Yujie, who had a bye in the first and second weeks. The results of yesterday's matches and today's schedule are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Mr. New Quixote <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>Mr. New Quixote's background is not a noble knight, but a nouveau riche who has fallen into ruin. He doesn't really want to be a knight, but just pretends to be one. He is not really enthusiastic about ancient chivalry, but is blinded by profit and desire, causing him to stumble and fall, showing a ridiculous and hateful image of an awkward knight that is even worse than Mr. Quixote.</p>
<p>He is not tall, in fact he is very short; he rides not a skinny horse, but a starving dog; he carries not a long spear, but a short sound. He wants to avoid ruin and maintain his status as a nouveau riche, but he can't think of any legitimate ways. So, he has to secretly dig into other people's walls and steal their property, and then sit high on his throne, leading his dog by the nose and waving his gavel, proclaiming his knightly victory over the demons!</p>
<p>His so-called demons are not windmills that he has mistaken, but all the owners of the things he has stolen.</p>
<p>Every time, he always steals in the dead of night, when people are unprepared. But, again and again, the thefts are discovered, and people naturally become wary. So, when he goes to dig into the walls again, he triggers an alarm. The shadow of ruin appears in his mind, but it also encourages his chivalrous spirit. He hardens his head, raises his gavel and strikes anyone he sees, and leads his starving dog to rampage through people's houses, rummaging through chests and cabinets while shouting: "I am helping you to slay demons, drive away thieves, and seek the welfare of your whole family!" And the starving dog under his crotch barks madly.</p>
<p>He still thinks that people are not awake from their dreams, and even if they have stood up, they are still confused; that he can scare them with a small chisel and deceive them with a few words. In this way, after plundering his "spoils of victory," he can proclaim to the outside world with great pride: "I have eradicated the demons!" What a beautiful knightly demeanor!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this wishful thinking, which only sees profit and not reality, is completely wrong. At this time, people are not only fully awake, but also prepared. This nouveau riche in decline, though he seems to have some brute strength, cannot withstand people's long-term group attack. Seeing that he is already hoarse and exhausted, and about to fall, he has no choice but to struggle again and stick out his tongue to the bystanders, uttering a few knightly words: "Look, the demons are at work! You must cooperate with me and work together to kill the demons, in order to seek eternal stability...peace..."</p>
<p>But who would listen to his nonsense and let him constantly rob their homes? Some slapped the clown to the ground, and others kicked over the starving dog. He, this Mr. New Quixote, could only touch his nose and stare blankly.</p>

<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>The second half of the night was particularly cold. Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan, two brothers dressed as farmers, braved the wind and followed a vague map, carrying that letter, to reach the designated place before dawn.</p>
<p>It was too cold, and the moon and stars dared not come out, only a dark cloud. There was no light on the road, only the flashlights in the hands of Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan. They each took their frozen feet and walked with big and fast steps. Occasionally, a few singing tunes came out of their mouths, but they were blown down by the cold wind, and the result was still silence.</p>
<p>Their hearts were beating faster than their steps; hot, almost boiling. The blood in their bodies was also surging. Their spirits were good enough, and they moved forward bravely with their chests raised.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, suddenly, a loud stomp and a surprised cry:</p>
<p>"Hey! Who's there?"</p>
<p>Meng Yuan shone the flashlight to the side, and Zhong Yuan's flashlight also lit up: a person wearing a grass green military uniform, short, with a rifle, was the enemy's sentry.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" The bayonet of the rifle was waving between the heads of Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan.</p>
<p>Both flashlights went out, and the map in Zhong Yuan's hand also fell. The short sentry took out a flashlight and shined it on them. They had gone the wrong way.</p>
<p>The short sentry picked up the map: "Eight ga ya lu!"</p>
<p>Under the threat of the rifle, they were taken away by him. Meng Yuan seized an opportunity to divert the attention of the short sentry, stuffed that letter, that confidential letter, into his mouth, chewed it a few times, and swallowed it. The short sentry was shivering from the cold and was preparing to pull the trigger, so he didn't notice at all.</p>
<p>Passing a small slope and going down the mountain road was the enemy's branch camp.</p>
<p>Eight or nine soldiers with small mustaches were shivering around a pile of fire.</p>
<p>The short sentry brought Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan over, and they all stood up, as if they were very happy, and as if they were very scared, they quickly raised their guns.</p>
<p>"These two people were sneaking around on the mountain road, and they were also carrying flashlights, maps..."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" A mournful-faced officer blurted out these words after a minute.</p>
<p>"We are farmers," Meng Yuan's weak voice.</p>
<p>"Then where did the flashlight come from?"</p>
<p>"Stolen," Zhong Yuan's loud voice.</p>
<p>"What about the map? How could you have a map?"</p>
<p>"Picked up," still Zhong Yuan.</p>
<p>"Hey, lies! You are spies! You can't hide it from me!" The short sentry caught Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan, and of course wanted to show off his achievements. After speaking, he smiled with his mouth stretched out, as if to show off, and as if he was complacent.</p>
<p>They had already searched Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan, and not only searched them, but also hit them hard with the butt of the rifle.</p>
<p>"If you tell me the information you want to bring, or the battle plan you want to notify, you can avoid death!" the officer said.</p>
<p>They were silent. The short sentry spoke again:</p>
<p>"No need to ask nicely, let's give them a little color to see first!"</p>
<p>The officer actually accepted a sentry's suggestion. So, an axe was brought. The tallest person took the axe and told Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan to stretch out their hands and press their fingers on the table. He hammered down hard with the back of the axe. Once, twice... Tears fell from Meng Yuan and Zhong Yuan's eyes, one drop, two drops—falling on their bodies, like a drop of kerosene, falling into the flames, arousing fierce anger.</p>
<p>One minute, two minutes, their fingernails cracked open; blood, thread by thread...</p>
<p>Zhong Yuan suddenly screamed sharply, his throat hoarse, with blood and tears; his nerves were also numb, and the stimulation of death, the devil's poisonous hand, made him lose his autonomy.</p>
<p>"I'm willing to tell you, we're carrying a letter, and the letter says tomorrow morning..." Zhong Yuan said in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The tallest person stopped, and everyone held their breath, looking at Zhong Yuan.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Meng Yuan, who was on the side, grabbed the axe from the enemy's hand and struck Zhong Yuan's head violently. A stream of bright red blood spurted several feet high.</p>
<p>Then, following the momentum, he struck his own throat with another axe, and bright red blood also spurted several feet away.</p>
<p>A group of short soldiers were stunned, and some shouted loudly; what they saw was the most tragic scene in the world!</p>
<p>Meng Yuan fell into the pool of blood, convulsed and crawled over, stroking his brother's body with trembling hands, a final smile floating on his face.</p>

<p>——On National Novels</p>
<p>"Emerald City was written by Li Baichuan of the Qing Dynasty. The Yenching University library has an old manuscript with the author's preface. The only other versions have a preface by Tao in the 29th year of Qianlong and a preface by Hou in the 36th year of Qianlong. It is now only known that Baichuan was a native of Jiangnan, named Zhu Xiang. (See Sun Kaidi's 'List of Popular Novels,' page 249.)</p>
<p>Volumes 54 to 59, these six volumes of this book, are about suppressing the Japanese pirates in Zhejiang. The historical figures include Yu Dayou, Lin Run, Zhang Jing, Yan Song, and Zhao Wenhua. There are also fictional characters such as Zhu Wenwei and Lin Dai. The big facts are one true and nine false. The true parts are mostly specifically pointed out in the book. For example, Hai Rui's memorial to the emperor is found in Volume 226 of the History of Ming. Volume 56, which describes Wenhua presenting wine, is based on Volume 308 of the History of Ming, the Biography of Zhao Wenhua: 'Wenhua wanted to ingratiate himself with the emperor and presented Baihua Immortal Wine, falsely saying, "Your servant's teacher Song takes it and lives long." The emperor drank it and found it sweet, and ordered to ask Song. Song was surprised and said, "How did Wenhua get this?" Then he said, "Your servant has never been near medicine. I don't know why I live so long." Song hated Wenhua for not telling him first, and summoned him to scold him. Wenhua knelt and wept, and dared not rise for a long time. Xu Jie and Li Ben saw this and interceded for him, and then ordered him to leave. When Song returned home after vacation, the nine ministers came to pay their respects. Song was still angry with Wenhua and ordered his servants to help him out. Wenhua was very embarrassed and heavily bribed Song's wife to intercede for him. Wenhua came out to pay his respects, and Song treated him as before.'"</p>
<p>The novel says: "The suppression of the Japanese pirates section criticizes Hu Meilin without reservation. I don't know what he means. Although Meilin's general career is not worth watching, his merits and demerits are enough to offset each other. Among the local officials at the time, he cannot be said to be unremarkable, and it is not right to write him off with a stroke of the pen." Guessing, the big reason is that Hu Zongxian flattered Yan Song and was considered to be part of the Yan faction. "The novel often regrets this." But Hu Zongxian was able to use Qi Jiguang and Yu Dayou, which can also be said to be knowing people and being good at employing them.</p>
<p>"The Three Marshals Achieve Great Achievements in Suppressing the Japanese Pirates" is mostly fabricated. This chapter narrates that Lin Dai led more than a hundred generals and soldiers outside the city of Jiangning to kill the barbarian leader Miao Mei among the 50,000 to 60,000 Japanese pirates. Xu Hai and Zaizhen, etc., are obviously inconsistent with historical facts. The so-called three marshals refer to Yu Dayou, Lin Dai, and Zhu Wenwei. According to the Biography of Yu Dayou in the History of Ming, "The new Japanese pirates defeated the soldiers of the Nanjing Capital Governor Zhou Gand the 30-odd ships." In this way, the governor Lu Fengyi, who defended Nanjing, was also somewhat unreliable.</p>
<p>But these six chapters of the story of suppressing the Japanese pirates are generally correct, such as Zhang Jing's injustice and Lin Run's impeachment of Yan Song, which are all famous historical facts.</p>
<p>The book describes Zhao Wenhua bribing the Japanese pirates with 600,000 gold, asking them to pretend to be defeated, so as to claim credit, which can be said to scold this traitor severely. And the section describing the three marshals sweeping away the Japanese pirates is also extremely gratifying: "The Japanese pirates were killed by the officers and soldiers in a chaotic manner, and they ran for another five or six miles. Seeing that the chasing soldiers were gradually far away, they each searched to the river bank, and there were only more than 20 seagoing ships. The pirates scrambled to cross, killing each other, and the sound of crying shook the sky and the earth. There were many people and the boats were heavy, and several more ships sank. The pirates were hungry, and they collapsed along the way, or those who could not move were all killed by the officers and soldiers, no less than four or five thousand people. At dawn, the chasing soldiers arrived again and searched everywhere. The pirates in the ship were walking when they suddenly heard the sound of the river shaking, a loud cannon, and the river was full of warships, and the cannons and rockets were like rain. The Japanese pirates were wounded by arrows and cannons, and nine out of ten were injured. When they arrived at Jiaoshan, they were smashed to pieces by Dayou's cannons, and not a single ship or a single person escaped from the waterway. Dayou had ambushes in all the sea entrances, and he also killed a lot of escaped pirates." (Excerpt from Volume 59) The Japanese pirates were defeated, which was no different from Cao Aman's defeat at Chibi, which made people excited.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Course of China's Gold and Silver Policy <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>In wartime financial policy, monetary policy, in the era before currency management, involved recoining to reduce the value of currency in order to increase revenue. In the modern era of currency management, it involves inflation for utilization. However, China has not taken the path of inflation. Instead, it has combined increasing tax revenue and issuing public debt for utilization, making it the primary wartime financial strategy. The ongoing policy of collecting gold and silver is aimed at increasing the strength of wartime finance. The recent report in this newspaper about the Ministry of Finance's circular on the 21st, prohibiting private purchase of gold and silver by silver businesses and establishing a purchasing method, can be said to represent the peak of the gold and silver collection policy.</p>
<p>Since silver was nationalized on November 3, 1935, the most forceful aspect of the wartime gold and silver policy has been the "Regulations for Converting Gold into Legal Tender" and its implementation details, announced on the 10th. These regulations stipulated that those who exchanged raw gold, goldware, gold coins, or newly produced gold nuggets and gold dust for legal tender would receive a handling fee of three to five percent. An additional six percent was given for purchasing national salvation bonds, and for legal tender deposits, a weekly interest of two tenths of a percent was added to the newly set interest rate. Secondly, the "Measures for Supervising Silver Shops in Collecting and Converting Gold" announced on November 1, 1938, stipulated that silver shops could only buy or sell gold and nine-tenths pure gold in the form of ornaments and utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, gold dust, and mined gold were strictly prohibited from being bought or sold. Shops specializing in buying gold dust and mined gold were required to contact the Central Bank to establish a entrusted contract and resell all of it to the Central Bank. In mid-November of the same year, restrictions were further imposed on the private export of gold and gold ornaments of any shape, or their transport to occupied areas. Auxiliary methods included: The "National Salvation Bond Issuance Measures" stipulated that national currency, hard currency, foreign currency, and raw gold and silver could be used to purchase bonds, while the "Gold Bond" regulations specified that raw gold or gold coins could be used to purchase bonds.</p>
<p>The above main and auxiliary measures for the collection of gold and silver can be said to be very detailed. However, when China implemented the legal tender policy, the method of issuing legal tender with 60% specie reserve and 40% guarantee to the issuing banks was not abolished. Therefore, there are still some shortcomings in the progress of wartime gold and silver collection policy. Although the main measures have clear regulations on purchase and transport, they have not considered the possibility of using the purchase as preparation for legal tender issuance. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance issued an order to financial institutions, stipulating that if silver businesses in various places have signed legal tender issuance contracts with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank, and purchased gold and silver as reserves, they should first report to the issuing bank they contacted and to the Gold and Silver Collection Office, and entrust them to handle the matter in accordance with the case, to eliminate speculation or smuggling. If they have not signed a legal tender issuance contract and do not report to request entrustment, they will be treated as private purchases for profit and punished according to the circumstances. This measure involves two agencies, the issuing bank and the Gold and Silver Collection Office, so it is naturally difficult for malpractices to occur, making it easier to prevent or eliminate speculation or smuggling.</p>
<p>This set of regulations is likely to bring the following two benefits to China's wartime finances:</p>
<p>First, the penetration of legal tender into the people. Taking silver alone, since the implementation of the legal tender system, the silver collected by the government, excluding the original reserves of various banks, amounted to 22.5 million yuan by the end of June 1936. However, according to estimates, the result of years of import and export is that there should be at least 700 million yuan of silver in the country. The minimum amount that can be concentrated should be 350 million yuan, meaning that at least half of the silver in the country is scattered among the people. The current provision that silver businesses in various places can purchase silver as legal tender reserve allows legal tender to flow more widely into remote rural areas.</p>
<p>Second, the increase in overseas funds. Overseas funds are financial goods that can be used for international payments. Although all countries in the world have now abandoned the gold standard, gold still retains the function of value storage in international payments. As for silver, although it does not have the same storage function as gold, China can easily convert silver into gold under the Sino-American Monetary Agreement. The application of this measure will naturally be more effective in collecting gold and silver in various places compared to relying solely on the Gold and Silver Collection Office, and will rapidly increase overseas funds.</p>
<p>The progress of China's wartime gold and silver collection policy, as discussed in the second paragraph of this article, to the current silver business gold and silver purchase measures, shows that the collection methods are becoming more diversified, and the rules for preventing malpractices are becoming more stringent. It is commendable that so much progress has been made in a short year and a half. As for using gold and silver collection as a monetary policy in wartime financial policy, replacing the inflationary monetary policy, and using it in parallel with tax and public debt policies, this kind of wartime financial policy is worthy of study.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Path Our Country's Wartime Industry Should Take <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xishan</p>
<p>Promoting the Construction of Small-Unit Production System</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan, nineteen months have passed, and the number of industries that have moved from the war zones to the interior and those newly built in the southwestern provinces is not small. This is indeed a good phenomenon in our country's War of Resistance. To strengthen the War of Resistance, the primary task is to increase the total national production. The government uses not currency, but material goods and labor to perform its duties. In peacetime, the government can obtain a fixed amount of currency income from the annual national income to purchase the necessary material goods and labor. Therefore, the source of national finance in peacetime can be based on national income, earnings, and consumption. However, once a country enters a state of war, its need for material goods and labor is many times greater than in peacetime, and the nature of its needs is even more urgent. In this situation, the government absolutely cannot rely entirely on taxes to cope with the environment, but should make every effort to use all domestic resources to increase the total national production, in order to obtain a large amount of material goods to supply the general needs of the war.</p>
<p>In our country's current situation, Japan is using both economic and military force in an attempt to destroy all of our country's economic undertakings. In the war zones, it has occupied our country's markets and all resources. At the same time, it is using military force to seize all the factories in the war zones, forcefully occupying them. Just in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, 70 percent of our country's newest large-scale factories have been damaged or occupied. All the industrial areas in our country, including Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuxi, Nanjing, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places, have had their production functions completely eliminated. Japan's sole attempt is to completely destroy China's entire production capacity, so that China's material needs for the War of Resistance will depend entirely on imports from foreign countries. At the same time, it is also engaged in destroying and preventing the import of foreign materials, so that China loses its long-term War of Resistance strength. Everything is under Japanese control and manipulation. This kind of attempt, in fact, is a policy of wishful thinking. However, with China's major cities and economic functions being destroyed and seized by the Japanese, if our country does not quickly seek to rebuild and strive to strengthen economic production capacity, it will fall into Japan's trap.</p>
<p>Therefore, strengthening the production mechanism is our country's current urgent task. Although our country's general production has been developing continuously in the rear since the start of the war, according to our country's current economic mechanism, these are not enough to fully adapt to the needs of the entire War of Resistance. Therefore, we believe that the large-scale development of small-unit industry is necessary to promote in China's current situation. What is the large-scale development of small-unit industry? To put it clearly, it is the large-scale construction of small-capital unit industries throughout the country during the War of Resistance, the scattered construction of a large number of production units to lay the economic foundation for long-term War of Resistance, and to compensate for all the production capacity lost in the war zones.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason for promoting this small-unit industrial production is not simply based on the desire to strengthen the general production mechanism. To put it more broadly, it is to adapt to the needs of the entire War of Resistance. This point can be explained in detail from the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The most valuable point of small-capital industries is the convenience of planning and establishment. This can be analyzed from two aspects: In terms of capital: Speaking from the general investment psychology of the people, in the state of war, private investors often regard investment in large-scale industries as a risk, which is inevitable. But it is more possible in fact to set aside a portion of their funds to engage in small-capital industries. At the same time, it can lead a portion of the idle funds in society into legitimate production undertakings. Secondly, from the point of view of establishment, it is difficult to establish a large-scale industry even in peacetime; let alone in wartime, whether it is the design of power and machinery, the acquisition of raw materials, the recruitment of technical talents, and other issues, it will inevitably be doubly difficult. Small-capital industries, however, take simplicity and ease as a prerequisite, so it is easy to solve the above-mentioned problems, and can make the most of local resources as a basis for production.</p>
<p>(2) If large-scale industries are concentrated in one place to achieve mass production to meet huge needs, it will create a target for enemy occupation and bombing, making these production organizations lose their security guarantee. And once necessary, it is not easy to move. For example, the number of factories in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places that have been damaged due to the difficulty of moving machinery is more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, in order to avoid this kind of damage and maintain production strength, it is better to turn large into small and establish a large number of small-scale factories in various parts of the interior. This can not only maintain the overall productivity, but also establish a strong foundation for future economic development. Our country's financial and industrial organizations have always been concentrated in a small number of cities. Although the interior is rich in resources, the population is sparse and desolate. This kind of uneven crisis can be solved by using small-unit industrial organizations to build a base in these undeveloped areas. In the future, this base can be used as a basis for development and expansion. At the same time, several units can be united to establish a strong industrial center according to their regional distribution. Then, not only can everything be planned in a unified manner, but also a solid and practical path can be opened up for future production and construction.</p>
<p>(3) The promotion of small-unit industrial system can directly assist the military, because it can supply the needs of the front line of the War of Resistance. To establish a large-scale industry, it is necessary to use heavy machinery, hire a large number of workers, and build huge factory buildings to accommodate them before production can be carried out. Therefore, it must be established in a safe area in the rear. This kind of industry, in terms of its efficiency, can indeed constitute the industrial mechanism planned by the government and complete the production of various important supplies. However, it is not as easy and mobile as small-scale industry, and can be established in various areas near the front line. The front line of the battlefield has a great need for various material supplies, and most of them are of an urgent nature. But in fact, it is often difficult to quickly supply what they need from the rear due to the inconvenience of transportation and other reasons. Under this kind of combination of injuries, it is necessary to establish direct supply units in the nearby areas of the front line to facilitate military assistance. This requirement is difficult for large-scale industries to meet, and only small-scale industries can adapt to it.</p>
<p>(4) The large-scale promotion of small-capital industries can solve our country's current refugee problem. Since the outbreak of war in our country, the number of refugees has increased day by day due to the large war zone. Therefore, the relief of refugees has become a serious problem in our country. It is estimated that there are currently at least 50 to 60 million refugees in the country, trapped in difficult situations, and their lives are completely dependent on the maintenance of the government or other social organizations. The existence of this kind of fact has a direct damage to the government and society. These huge number of refugees not only lose their production capacity, but also have to be supplied with huge consumption. And the increase in refugees in the future is still possible. If this continues for a long time, it will be detrimental to our country's long-term war of resistance plan. Under the large-scale promotion of small-unit industrial system, these wasted labor forces will have the possibility of production. At the same time, the need for millions of dollars of refugee relief every month can also be used for production purposes.</p>
<p>(5) The small-unit industrial system can serve as the center for developing rural economic organizations. Due to the migration of a large number of people to the rural areas in the interior, various desolate areas have become densely populated areas, and the need for materials has increased sharply. However, where does this huge amount of materials come from in the self-sufficient rural areas to meet the needs? In this situation, the opportunistic import of foreign goods and inferior goods is inevitable. And the distribution of small-capital industries in various places can produce locally and meet local needs, prosper desolate areas and develop markets, in order to revitalize the rural economy. At the same time, it is also an effective warning line to prevent the import of foreign goods and inferior goods.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be clearly seen that promoting the small-unit industrial system has great advantages for our country's War of Resistance plan. And with the economic functions of various important cities being destroyed by the enemy today, our country feels an urgent need for this.</p>
<p>How should this plan be promoted? This is also a point that we should discuss. To establish a huge number of small-unit industries is a great plan, and it cannot be expected to be realized in a day or two. Therefore, we hope to proceed step by step in order. For the convenience of promotion, there should first be a basic organization to serve as the center of promotion. The first step of this central organization should be to conduct a general survey. This general survey includes two tasks: One is to estimate or investigate the nature and extent of the current material needs. If you do not understand the needs, how can you supply them? Therefore, this is a basic goal to determine production. Based on this goal, the types of production that should be available can also be determined, and their importance and urgency can be reviewed and adjusted. The second is to investigate the distribution of resources in various regions according to the regional distribution, and to divide the establishment of various units. With these two concrete goals, the foundation for construction has also been laid. At the same time, the government should use incentives to promote the will of the people to expand investment in small-unit industries, and use various positive methods to provide convenience, assistance, and guarantees in planning and establishment, so that this source of legitimate investment can be smoothly promoted.</p>
<p>With concrete goals and a clear plan of action, there should also be a complete organization in the management of the promotion to be the central hub for control and guidance, so that each small unit can obtain reasonable and good efficiency under unified action. The following is a brief discussion of the points that should be controlled and guided:</p>
<p>Control is the fundamental management of the types and scope of unit activities by the power and methods of a group. The small-unit industrial system is distributed in various places, and if it is not controlled, it will inevitably create a scattered and uncoordinated phenomenon. There are two principles for starting to control the small-unit industrial system: (1) Production control, (2) Raw material control. Production control: is to make the supply and demand of each unit's production adapt to each other, in order to prevent unnecessary waste and imbalance in production. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote the standardization of unit production. This does not only mean that each unit should be standardized, but that the standardization of the entire unit's production should be promoted. The effectiveness of standardization can make: (1) Production accurate, (2) Obtain a huge amount of output with a small number of types to meet the needs of wartime, (3) The affairs of the products can be simple, and the completion of the products can be rapid and excellent, (4) Due to the standard of production, the waste of raw materials and manufacturing costs can be reduced.</p>
<p>The importance of raw material control is greater than production. Wartime production gives priority to military needs. Therefore, the first principle of raw material control is that the manufacture of military supplies should have priority in the use of raw materials. For example, if factories A and B use the same raw materials, but factory B is an ordinary factory, and the products of factory A are for military needs, then factory A should have priority in the use of that raw material. During wartime, if the raw materials of military industries are not controlled, and important production is given priority, it will greatly hinder military affairs. Take the United States during the European War as an example. After the United States entered the war, it set 60,000 items of military supplies and military raw materials for the industrial areas in the east. Among this huge number of items, their military value varied from large to small, from urgent to slow. However, due to the lack of control, often those with small military value or slow need were produced first. And the urgent military supplies could not be manufactured due to the lack of raw materials. As a result, the wartime production in the United States at that time fell into a state of extreme chaos. Therefore, at this extraordinary time, our country cannot ignore the control of raw materials, otherwise the impact will be no small matter for military affairs.</p>
<p>Secondly, guidance and improvement are also very important. Guidance is a reasonable inspiration, and improvement is the starting point for advancement. Under this wartime state, in order to increase the total national production, the government has the necessity to control production and raw materials, and should also give guidance and improvement to everything inside production. This can be divided into operation, organization, labor, and machinery. Regarding operations: (1) Reasonable guidance on operating methods and improvement of production technology; (2) Whether the division of labor and cooperation system of operations is suitable; (3) Reasonable allocation of operation time and rest time should be given; (4) The connection of efficiency between people and projects. Regarding organization: (1) Guidance on the organization system, (2) Division of industrial and administrative affairs; Regarding labor: (1) Implementation of improving the lives of workers; (2) Guidance on the actions of workers; to make the actions of workers simple, reduce fatigue, and seek to strengthen work efficiency. (3) Discovering the shortcomings of workers in manufacturing, and improving and guiding them in methods. In summary, at this extraordinary time, strengthening the production mechanism is our country's current urgent task. The production of large-scale development of small-unit industrial system is as important as large enterprises. And its advantages are better than large enterprises, and it can closely meet the wartime environment. Therefore, promoting the small-unit industrial system is the path that our country's wartime industrial construction should take today.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Promoting the construction of small-unit production system is indeed the main objective, but there are still two points that seem to be neglected by the author: (1) the acquisition of small machines. The construction of small-unit production system is to consider that large industries are controlled by the enemy, or not adapted to the production situation in the interior. Therefore, its nature is between handicraft industry and machine industry. Recently, people in the interior have also realized this. Do not see that this newspaper often has letters asking about small flour milling machines and spinning machines? However, how to manufacture this kind of machinery and where to obtain it are also prerequisites for the construction of small-unit production. (2) The areas occupied by the Japanese army are mostly cities. Therefore, the industry in the cities is often occupied and controlled. If you want not to be used by them, you can only move to the countryside. However, building small industrial units in the countryside, protecting and nurturing them, depends on the guerrillas. If the guerrillas cannot take this responsibility, the result will still be occupied and controlled by others. This is also worth thinking deeply about. Therefore, the responsibility of the guerrillas is not only to destroy the enemy's work, but also to organize and protect the property of the people in the guerrilla area, and to promote their construction, so as to be the foundation for the revival of the national industry in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Recent Popularity of Brazilian Cotton on the Market <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Di Xuan</p>
<p>In the past, due to the low domestic cotton production and high consumption, it was necessary to import a large amount of foreign cotton to make up the deficiency. As late as 1934, this reached a huge 3.7 million dan (a unit of weight). Subsequently, the central government and various provinces actively improved cotton cultivation, and foreign cotton imports were drastically reduced. In recent years, they have been less than 500,000 dan, roughly balancing with exports. After August 13th, most of the textile factories stopped work, cotton consumption greatly decreased, and cotton imports were almost completely cut off. Unexpectedly, since November of last year (1938), Shanghai textile factories have purchased a large amount of foreign cotton. The main reason for this is that cotton from the provinces of Hubei, Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi cannot be transported to Shanghai. The only sources are the cotton produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and a small amount of cotton exported from Tianjin. Due to inconvenient transportation, extraordinarily high transportation costs, and increased costs, the price of this cotton has greatly increased. Foreign cotton, on the other hand, has abundant reserves and has fallen to the lowest prices. Although foreign exchange has greatly shrunk, its converted price is close to the Shanghai cotton price, and sometimes even lower, which has led to a sudden surge in foreign cotton trading that has been dormant for a long time. This is particularly detrimental to the national economy in wartime.</p>
<p>Traditionally, my country's imported foreign cotton has included American cotton, Indian cotton, and Egyptian cotton. Recently, there has been a sudden increase in Brazilian cotton. Brazilian cotton production has not been well-known in the past, and my country's imports have been particularly small. Now it is suddenly on par with American and Indian cotton. Looking at this newspaper's current cotton transactions, Brazilian cotton exceeds a thousand bales, not inferior to American and Indian cotton, and even more so than Egyptian cotton. The cotton industry is quite surprised by this phenomenon, and their knowledge of Brazilian cotton is not very extensive. According to my observations, under the current circumstances, the import of this type of cotton can be sustained for a long time. Therefore, I will briefly describe the general situation of Brazilian cotton for the reference of the cotton industry.</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton production was not well-known in the past. In 1933, it was less than 500,000 bales, just enough to meet domestic demand. After that year, the government actively promoted cotton cultivation, and cotton field production increased dramatically. In the 1933-34 season, it increased to 1 million bales (each bale weighing 478 pounds). In the 1935-36 season, it increased again to 1.765 million bales, more than tripling in three years. In 1936-37, it was 1.712 million bales. In 1937-38, it increased again to 2.203 million bales, more than 4.5 times the increase from 1933. The speed of progress in cotton production is truly astonishing. Judging from its growth rate, it will soon be on par with our country. Northern Brazil is the most extensive, with the Amazon River crisscrossing it, but due to the humid climate, it is not suitable for cultivation. Therefore, cotton cultivation is entirely in the south. In terms of its cotton-growing areas, it can be divided into northern and southern parts. The development of cotton cultivation is most prominent in the south. In 1931-32, the south produced 126,000 bales, and the north produced 429,000 bales. By 1937-38, the south produced 1.404 million bales, and the north produced 787,000 bales. The province with the most cotton cultivation is Sao Paulo on the southern coast, accounting for half of the country's production. The rest are less than one-tenth, so the cotton market center is in Sao Paulo City. What can be said about Brazilian cotton production is the remarkably high yield per acre. In Sao Paulo province, the maximum yield per acre reaches 1,000 English pounds, and 500 pounds is very common. The average yield in the Sorocabana region of the state is consistently 450 pounds. Egypt, known for its highest yield, is only 350 pounds, while our country and the United States are both around 200 pounds, less than half of that. However, the yield in the north is very low, and the national average is not very high. Because the yield per acre in its main cotton-growing areas is very high, and the general wages in Brazil are low, the cost of Brazilian cotton is relatively low. According to reports, the production cost of Mater cotton is about two pence per pound. If calculated at our country's statutory British currency exchange rate, it is only 14 cents. The lowest cost of cotton cultivation in our country is far above this figure, not to mention American cotton. The market price of Brazilian cotton reported in this newspaper is lower than that of American cotton of the same grade, which is probably the reason.</p>
<p>There are two main types of cotton in Brazil: perennial tree cotton and annual cotton. Tree cotton can grow for 15 years and has relatively long fibers. There are also many varieties of herbaceous cotton, mostly American upland cotton varieties. Therefore, the fiber of the cotton produced can be spun into yarn of 100 counts or more, and some are as short as 15mm. Usually, 27 to 35mm is more common. The Sao Paulo province has a grading bureau that divides cotton into nine grades. According to reports, the percentage of each grade of cotton produced in 1936 and 1937 is as follows: "1936" Grade 1: 0, Grade 2: 0.06, Grade 3: 2.64, Grade 4: 14.84, Grade 5: 38.25, Grade 6: 22.75, Grade 7: 17.09, Grade 8: 5.54, Grade 9: 1.17, Sub-Grade 9: 0.44. "1937" Grade 1: 0, Grade 2: 0.32, Grade 3: 6.85, Grade 4: 29.85, Grade 5: 35.41, Grade 6: 17.80, Grade 7: 5.91, Grade 8: 1.75, Grade 9: 2.45, Sub-Grade 9: 0.16. Generally speaking, its ordinary cotton is close to American middling, suitable for spinning medium-count yarns like those in our country, and can replace medium-grade American cotton and high-grade Indian cotton.</p>
<p>The Brazilian cotton spinning industry also has a considerable position. Before the European War, there were 1.2 million spindles in the country. After that, it gradually developed, and recently it has increased to 2.7 million spindles. The raw cotton used is entirely produced domestically, because it has both long and short fibers, so there is no need to seek it abroad. Its cotton consumption was 587,000 bales in the 1934-35 season (each bale weighing 500 pounds), 654,000 bales in 1935-36, 710,300 bales in 1936-37, and 620,000 bales in 1937-38. In addition, general consumption is 70,000 bales. Therefore, Brazilian cotton production was only sufficient for self-sufficiency in the past. In recent years, after the increase in production, it has become surplus and sold abroad. Generally speaking, due to its lower cotton cultivation costs, at a time when American and Indian cotton exports are sluggish, Brazilian cotton exports have increased sharply along with the progress of its production. According to the report of the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Brazilian cotton exports, calculated in bales of 180 kilograms each, were 770,000 bales in 1935, 1.113 million bales in 1936, and 1.312 million bales in 1937. Almost all of the cotton produced is exported, except for domestic use. In terms of exporting countries, in 1937, Germany was first with 470,000 bales, Japan was second with 283,000 bales, and the United Kingdom was third with 263,000 bales (360,000 bales in 1936). In addition, France had 70,000 bales, Italy 44,000 bales, and Portugal 40,000 bales. Almost all of the world's major cotton-consuming countries have it. Even the cotton-producing United States had 12,000 bales, and India had 1,000 bales. My country had 11,628 bales in 1936, and it increased to 22,972 bales in 1937. According to the statistical report of the International Agricultural Association on world cotton trade, Brazil has risen to fourth place among exporting countries, second only to the United States, India, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Due to the different climates in the cotton-growing areas of Brazil, the planting and harvesting seasons also vary. In the northern cotton belt, the cotton harvesting period is from August of this year to January of the following year. The south is later, about March to June. Therefore, the "cotton season" in Sao Paulo ends at the end of February, which is very different from the end of the cotton season in July and August in the United States, India, Egypt, and our country. Therefore, the Brazilian government's accounting period for cotton production is different in the north and south. For example, when the first estimate of cotton production in the south is made, the north has already completely completed the third estimate.</p>
<p>The development of cotton cultivation in Brazil is relatively short, and the work on cotton economics is still being actively improved. In the past, roller gins were used for ginning, which had a great impact on quality. Later, the government controlled ginning and switched to saw gins, which greatly benefited the quality of cotton. The government has vigorously implemented grading work. Currently, most of the exported cotton has been graded. Cotton trading methods are also being improved. Some large-scale cotton companies are gradually establishing ginning factories in Brazilian cotton-growing areas to engage in cotton collection. For example, Meian Yoko, which used to operate American cotton in our country, is one of them. In the future, Brazilian cotton trade will become more active both internationally and in our country's markets, and those affected will naturally be American cotton and Indian cotton.

<p>Since this newspaper requested information about small spinning machines, we have received a letter from Mr. Chen Chuyao requesting to obtain the design of the Mu's 77 small spinning machine. We have also received a letter from a person named Hu Jiyou, stating that the Xin Zhong Xing Machine Factory on Xiaoshadu Road manufactures this small spinning machine. However, what kind of design it is is unknown and can be inquired about there. This letter did not originate from the factory, but from Mr. Hu. Since Mr. Hu does not know what the machine looks like, we dare not say that it definitely exists. Even if this machine exists, whether it is suitable is still unknown.</p>
<p>For this reason, the reporter also consulted friends familiar with the textile industry. According to them, someone mentioned the small hand-spinning machine trial-produced by the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute, which is roughly similar to a type of hand-spinning machine invented by Mr. Xing ten years ago (its description and photos were published in the Textile Times). However, Mr. Xing's machine was not promoted, presumably because there were still shortcomings in the structure. How the Mu's machine is structured is also unknown. However, according to the current inland yarn prices, profit can be obtained even with the most old-fashioned women's hand-spinning methods. Therefore, it is currently difficult to give a definitive answer about this spinning machine. We will disclose reliable information as soon as possible for the reference of those who are concerned about this matter. Liu Tang</p>
<p>Sugar Market: This Factory's Refined White</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Follows the decline of Dutch Raw White</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft. According to the guild's calculations, the market sentiment for Dutch raw white grade 24 was very weak after the futures price turned down. Spot prices also fell by 4 jiao, to 24.3 yuan. Transshipment goods fell by another 1 jiao, to 16.3 yuan. This warehouse's goods were 24.5 yuan, and Da Jin Qian grade goods were 24.7 yuan. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. This factory's refined white sugar, due to the decline in raw materials, also fell by 2 jiao. Zhen Ji No. 1 white was 25 yuan, and grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained the same. It is heard that a certain company still has more than 3,000 packages of old stock of Chaoqing, Youbao Huanggangqing, and other goods from the past, and plans to take advantage of the market to sell them all. The asking price may be slightly negotiable.</p>

<p>Tangerines (i.e., raw materials for immature tangerine peel) are produced in the inland areas of Chaozhou and Shantou. They are collected by rural farmers when the tangerines are first formed or when branches fall due to wind, and then dried. The best quality is considered to be heavy and firm. They are purchased in small quantities by local vendors and then sold. Recently, new goods have been abundant. A batch was recently loaded and immediately began selling well. The price for top-grade goods is 16 yuan per dan, middle-grade is 14 yuan, and lower-grade is 12 yuan. The market is stable, and several dozen pieces of old goods have been offered at a price of 9.5 yuan, a small decrease of 2 yuan from before.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Does the Shanghai Public Need Physical Exercise? <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in the East of our country. The life of the Shanghai public is an urban life. The shortcomings of urban life are small housing and polluted air. Therefore, the bodies of urban residents, due to environmental constraints, are not as healthy as the bodies of rural residents; the Shanghai public is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>Physical exercise is needed by the Shanghai public. In the past, the Shanghai local authorities broadcast the commands for public morning exercises on the radio, guiding the public to do a few physical exercises every day before starting work. This method was very good. However, because there were no designated sports venues, group exercises could not be performed, and the results were not significant. It is best to entrust specialists to designate locations in different districts and lead the public in person to engage in exercise, which is easier to achieve results. Now I will put forward a few points below:</p>
<p>(1) Name: Call it "Shanghai Public Physical Exercise," and tentatively set morning exercises as one item. If possible in the future, expand further.</p>
<p>(2) Organizers: Organized by enthusiastic local community groups, preferably the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA.</p>
<p>(3) Venues: Divide the city into several districts, and designate a school playground or open space in each district as a morning exercise venue.</p>
<p>(4) Instructors: One male and one female instructor should be set up in each district.</p>
<p>(5) Exercise time: From 7:00 am every day, for a maximum of one hour, or held every other day.</p>
<p>(5) Exercise program: In addition to stipulating a few morning exercises, a few fitness slogans can be shouted before exercising. After exercising, a fitness song can be sung to make the body and mind feel excited.</p>
<p>We know that only with a healthy body can we have a healthy career. Failure to pay attention to physical exercise not only affects physical health, but also affects the development of a career. It is hoped that the Shanghai public will unanimously advocate and implement it.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Pulley—Helping People Work <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Guang</p>
<p>The pulley is usually something that most people are familiar with, but the application of the pulley is not something that most people can fully understand. Now we will use a corner of this publication to talk about the pulley.</p>
<p>Pulleys have great utility in everyday life. They allow people to use very little strength to lift very large objects, and they can raise goods to very high places. Readers have certainly seen goods being loaded and unloaded on ships, right? At the same time, have you also seen the rise and fall of elevators? In fact, the role of the pulley has played a great function in this.</p>
<p>The pulley is constructed of three parts. The first part is the pulley wheel, which is a circular plate with a groove cut around the circumference to accommodate the rope. The second part is the pulley support, which is usually an elliptical block of wood with a hollowed-out center to accommodate the pulley. The two walls support the axis of the pulley to provide support. The third part is the rope, which runs inside the pulley and is used to lift goods.</p>
<p>The origin of the pulley: Initially, if humans wanted to raise heavy objects, they had to first erect a person in the position where the object should be raised, and then use force to lift the object up (as in the first diagram).</p>
<p>However, although this method can reduce some effort, the worker must stand in a very high place, which is very inconvenient. So, a step further was taken with the method in the second diagram. The worker stands below and just pulls the rope, and the heavy object can rise. This is much more convenient than the previous method. However, this method is still not good because the resistance between the rope and the wooden stick is too great, and it is still very difficult to pull. Later, after considerable research, someone invented a rational thing, and that is the pulley.</p>
<p>This pulley is hung high, and the worker only needs to pull the rope, then the goods can be raised easily, and lowered easily, without any effort.</p>
<p>The evolution of the pulley: The above pulley is a "free pulley." It can only change the direction of the force, but it cannot have any mechanical assistance, because if 100 catties of force is applied to one end of the rope, it will also be transmitted to the other end with 100 catties. The reason is that the "fixed pulley" used in the above diagram only pulls the weight of the object with one rope, and the resistance is too great, so it is not very labor-saving. If you can use the "movable pulley" in the fourth diagram, then the force will be even more labor-saving. Because the movable pulley is pulled by two ropes, the resistance is reduced by half, so it only takes one catty of force to pull up two catties of goods. However, according to the movable pulley in the fourth diagram, scientists have studied that although it can have mechanical assistance, the direction of force still needs to be pulled upwards, which is very inconvenient. So, later someone invented a movable pulley, plus a fixed pulley, then the difficulty is solved. As shown in the fifth diagram, one end of the rope is wrapped around the movable pulley, and then wrapped around a fixed pulley. In this way, not only can you get the assistance of the movable pulley, but you can also change the direction of force through the fixed pulley.</p>
<p>It seems that the evolution and improvement of the pulley is quite a bit.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the pulley: However, there is still room for improvement in the progress of the pulley. For example, wouldn't it be more labor-saving to connect several fixed and movable pulleys together? That's right, as long as you pay attention to the length of the rope and the distance the goods rise, you can get greater assistance from the pulley. There are also several methods of using multiple pulleys in combination.</p>
<p>(1) Each movable pulley is seated on a rope, and one end of each rope is nailed to the frame beam. Except for the first rope, the other end of each rope is wrapped around a movable pulley and connected under the movable pulley in front. The other end of the first rope is wrapped around a fixed pulley and tightly held in the worker's hand. As shown in the sixth diagram, after several turns of 16 catties of goods, the effort required is only one catty.</p>
<p>(2) There is also a device that is more flexible than the previous one, does not take up space, and is simpler and more convenient to use, that is, the device in the seventh diagram. This device is widely used, and until now, it is widely used in transportation and construction sites.</p>
<p>To summarize what has been said above, although the ratio of the length of the rope to the weight of the goods has not been explained in detail, the basic principles of the pulley structure have been generally explained. Nowadays, with the development of science, some people use steel chains instead of ropes, and iron pulleys instead of wooden pulleys, and use gear mechanisms instead of flat wheels, and even use engines instead of manpower. In this way, the function of the pulley is really astounding.</p>
<p>A scientific picture book also published an interesting experiment: Its title is "A Child Pulls Four Strong Men Together." Readers, will you not believe it? It is now introduced below for experimentation.</p>
<p>Four strong men are divided into two groups, two people in each group, each holding a sturdy wooden stick, facing each other. One end of a sturdy hemp rope is knotted on a stick on the right, and then wrapped back and forth around the two sticks for a total of three turns, so that there are six ropes between the two sticks. The last rope that extends out is held by a child, and this can be tested.</p>
<p>Assuming that each of these four strong men has a strength of 120 catties, then this child only needs to use 40 catties of strength to pull the four strong men together. The principle is actually the same as the function of compound pulleys.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Talking about Education for Refugee Children (1) <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Rongkai</p>
<p>Education is a nation's life vitamin, relating to the entire nation's strength, weakness, survival, and death. Education should be talked about in peacetime, and it should be talked about even more during extraordinary times. Since the outbreak of the August 13th war in 1937, it has created an unprecedented catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of fellow countrymen in distress have been displaced and gathered on solitary islands. These refugees, the remnants of the catastrophe, although able to maintain a minimum standard of living, but the responsibility we bear for the refugees is so great. Sustenance is for the continuation of life, and education is the food for the spirit. It can be seen how important refugee education is.</p>
<p>Talking about refugee education is indeed not an easy thing. Doing extraordinary education in special circumstances has many difficulties and is not comparable to ordinary education. It is necessary to understand and cope with refugee education in this extraordinary period through practical experience. In terms of measures and experience, a spirit of hard work is required to achieve some results. The author has been serving in refugee education for more than a year, and will talk about the experience gained in general terms, as a reference for a kind of refugee education. There will be omissions, and I hope that knowledgeable people will correct them at any time. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The war situation in South China has consistently been more intense than that in Shanxi, as has been proven by facts over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Japanese army launched several offensives in the Northwest, building railways and reinforcing troops crossing the river, intending to take advantage of the frozen Yellow River to reach Shaanxi in one go. However, in recent months, these offensives have not succeeded, and their plans have been thwarted by the Chinese army's pre-arranged strategies. The Northwest war situation has recently become quiet. Although it cannot be definitively said that there will be no more battles from now on, in reality, it is very disadvantageous for them to remain inactive.</p>
<p>Therefore, South China is the only good target for them. Expanding the war in South China is quite consistent with their current situation. The terrain is very important, and transportation is very convenient. Even thinking a step back, if the Japanese side wants to threaten Britain and France, and connect with Germany and Italy, it is also an excellent place.</p>
<p>With these reasons, we can select some relevant news for readers to refer to.</p>
<p>"The Japanese army in Guangdong Province continues to reinforce troops. The number of Japanese warships near Weizhou Island has increased to thirteen, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, and two each of transport ships and shallow-water vessels, patrolling the sea and transporting supplies daily."</p>
<p>"The Japanese army in the Sanshui area has been reinforcing troops for days. A part of them has moved along the Xiaobei River. The Japanese army attacking the Yuehan Railway is also planning to attack Sihui, approaching the rear of Zhaoqing obliquely. According to foreign observers, the Japanese army will launch attacks in South China in three routes: one landing in Beihai, advancing north along the highway, and invading southern Guangxi to cut off the connection between Guangxi and Vietnam; one invading Zhaoqing and Wuzhou along the West River; and another may advance circuitously to invade eastern Guangxi and threaten the rear of the Chinese army. The East River will adopt a feigned attack to contain the Chinese forces."</p>
<p>"According to a telegram from Haitian on the 21st, the war near the Yuehan Railway is unusually quiet. Both sides are adjusting their formations. The area from Guangdong Military Field via Huaxian to Conghua is a busy zone for military transportation and movements. The Japanese army on the West River is advancing towards Jinli and Lubao."</p>
<p>"Also, according to a telegram from Hong Kong on the 23rd, several French warships left Haiphong yesterday and sailed to Guangzhou Bay. It is widely believed that this is related to the activities of the Japanese navy in the Qiongzhou Strait. Foreign sources report that the French authorities are closely monitoring the development in the Leizhou Peninsula area, fearing that once a war breaks out there, it will endanger the safety of Guangzhou Bay."</p>

<p>Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) was a Swedish chemist who invented dynamite made from nitroglycerin and other substances, becoming immensely wealthy. After his death, he donated most of his property as the principal for the Nobel Prizes, totaling approximately 1.7 million pounds. Each year, the interest from this fund is used to award prizes to the world's top scholars, divided into five categories: 1. Physics, 2. Chemistry, 3. Medicine and Physiology, 4. Literature, 5. Those who have strived for international peace. Each category receives approximately 7,500 pounds annually. Some say that Nobel established this prize to atone for his achievements because he did not expect warmongers to use his inventions to harm their fellow human beings. Although this statement is based on fact, it feels somewhat harsh. We believe that this prize makes a significant contribution to the evolution of human civilization and assists it greatly.</p>
<p>According to a telegram, twelve members of the Swedish Parliament recently suggested to the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee that the 1939 Peace Prize should be awarded to Chamberlain because in September 1938, Europe was in a precarious situation due to the Czech issue, but Chamberlain's efforts saved it from a great disaster, and his contribution is truly undeniable.

<p>Yes, Chamberlain, in his old age, carrying an umbrella, flew to Munich twice last autumn and miraculously cleared up the European situation, which was filled with the clouds of war at that time, revealing a glimmer of hope for peace. We cannot say that it was not the success of his realism and appeasement policy. European people were spared from another war disaster, and his contribution is worthy of praise. However, is the crisis in Europe as optimistic as the Swedish parliamentarians feel, and has it now been eliminated? Former British Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Viscount Cranborne, recently stated in Weymouth: "The weakness of Britain's current attitude only brings the war closer. He has not seen any signs of Germany and Italy responding to Chamberlain's peace policy." (Reuters, London, same day) This is an extremely pertinent reply. In other words, Chamberlain's realism and appeasement policy have not only failed to promote peace, but on the contrary, have accelerated the arrival of war. At the same time, Czechoslovakia, because of the Munich Agreement, has completely deprived the Sudetenland region of coal supply. Now, they have no choice but to take emergency measures, supplying Germany with high-speed aircraft engines and aircraft parts to prevent the lack of this fuel. (Reuters, Prague, same day) Therefore, peace has not been achieved, and Czechoslovakia is already feeling the pain of being slaughtered. Who caused this? Who brought this about? Was it not Chamberlain's peace policy?</p>
<p>If we say that the Nobel Peace Prize is to reward the policy of sacrificing the weak, then it is simply superfluous, not to mention that sacrificing the weak cannot exchange the lament of the bellicose fascists, nor can it eliminate the ambition of the bellicose fascists.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Casual Talk on Tips <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Tingkang</p>
<p>A friend who recently returned from Hong Kong said that he hosted a banquet in a large restaurant there. Because he felt that Hong Kong was more extravagant than before, he used to give ten yuan in tips, but this time he doubled it to twenty. Unexpectedly, the waiters were indifferent and did not care. Later, he realized that since the wealthy old men from Shanghai arrived in Hong Kong, they give tips of at least one hundred or eighty. This made me "very surprised."</p>
<p>In a completely urbanized society, the tip system is developing abnormally. According to a survey by a London income tax officer, a waiter in a pub earns an average of 1,000 pounds in tips each year, which is not considered much, so it is also classified as an "easy money" category, and tips are therefore given extra importance. The income from tips often exceeds the explicitly stated salary by more than one or two times.</p>
<p>In the past, the stewards on the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping lines were famous for receiving tips. For an ordinary second-class cabin seat of two yuan, you would have to give at least two yuan in liquor money. A steward could manage four or five cabin seats, and his average monthly income was five or six hundred yuan, which was really not a small amount. Therefore, many stewards became moderately wealthy because of this (but most developed bad habits of opium smoking and gambling due to the ease of income). Later, state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other ships collected the liquor fees on behalf of the company, and the practice of tipping was slightly curtailed.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of seating arrangements in a Beijing opera theater, he most welcomed women with children and elderly merchants, who often gave two or three yuan in tips for a one-yuan ticket. Fortunately, some theaters have now abolished the seating arrangement system, so there are no tips at all.</p>
<p>Some people have painfully said that if the tip system is not overthrown, Chinese society will always be so snobbish. However, tracing the origin of tips, it is caused by ourselves. If you give one hundred yuan, and others give twenty yuan, you will inevitably be treated coldly. Naturally, the recipient will not think that both one hundred and twenty are extra, and giving people two different treatments is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>I also thought of two other things encountered in daily life: going to the barber shop and the bathhouse. For example, the stipulated price for a haircut is two cents, and for a shave is one cent, but some people give four or six cents at once. In addition to the stipulated price, the rest is naturally a tip. He gives you a particularly careful and thorough cut, so you give a little more reward. But unexpectedly, those who pay according to the rules receive discriminatory treatment. Therefore, everyone tacitly agrees to give more than the stipulated amount. The first person sets the trend, and everyone has to follow suit. In reality, it is his duty to give you a thorough cut.</p>
<p>Other things like giving rewards during the New Year, festivals, weddings, birthdays, etc., seem to be disguised tips. When servants deliver gifts to relatives and friends, "they always bring back a few cents or a few yuan as a thank you," can't this be considered a kind of tip?</p>
<p>There are too many examples. This society seems to be surrounded by tips. Although some people rely solely on tips to make a living, I hope that giving tips should not exceed what is reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Eunuchs <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Mr. Xiaoyu</p>
<p>I used to keep a cat. Following the advice of the old maid, I had it neutered. Sure enough, the animal grew exceptionally strong, but there was one drawback: after being neutered, it became listless, only knowing how to eat and sleep. It neither caught mice at night nor looked for lovers in the spring.</p>
<p>Opening the Shen Bao of January 25th, who knew that the first headline that caught my eye was a Japanese lawmaker suggesting castration. It is said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare dared not implement this virtuous (?) policy because the people opposed it, which aroused the severe criticism from two members of the Minseito party for their conservatism and uselessness. This eunuch policy is on the agenda of the sacred parliament of the supreme East Asian alliance leader, anti-communist axis, new order inventor, and successor to the first-class power. It is truly civilization to the extreme now.</p>
<p>I don't know if these two congressmen are representatives of the people? Are they seeing the "bosses" (military men) engage in militarism, reverse their actions, and constantly use big hats like "Yamato spirit" and loyalty to the emperor to force the people to bow their heads and obediently serve as cannon fodder to fight against the Chinese, who share the same culture, and still feel that the sacrifice is not thorough enough, wanting to turn the people into a uniform group of dull, neutered cats.</p>
<p>I came up with an idea for the Japanese people, which is to use their own methods to deal with them. For now, it would be better for everyone to rise up and castrate these warlords and politicians who speak with one voice as the warlords first. See if they will be so fierce and evil after they become eunuchs. Furthermore, it would be good to have fewer mixed-up little demons and semi-dummies who act as accomplices to oppress their compatriots in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Movement after the Silence of Cultural Street <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>The corner of Fourth Road and Henan Road, lined with bookstores and instrument companies, has always been regarded as a cultural street. In our experience, we know that every year, after the winter and summer vacations, when school starts, Cultural Street is particularly lively, while the rest of the time can be considered a period of silence.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the education sector on the "isolated island" is leaderless, the vacations of various schools this time are not unified, and there are some differences. Some are within the winter vacation, and some have already started. Therefore, these days, after several months of silence, Cultural Street is active again.</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about a few big bookstores. The books they publish are more than just one kind, but textbooks are wholesaled in thousands, and the number of sales is much larger than any literary or scientific book. Therefore, they have made a lot of money. Therefore, when the school season comes, every bookstore focuses on textbooks and engages in a competition.</p>
<p>These days, we walked through this Cultural Street, paying attention to what they displayed in their shop windows. They are all textbooks, and other books have disappeared. The words "Books and stationery, sold at low prices" are pasted on the glass windows, and some even use simple advertisements behind the shop window as a backdrop for textbooks.</p>
<p>On this Cultural Street, if we pay attention, both men and women are busy entering and exiting bookstores or instrument stores. Among them, there are also students wearing school uniforms and badges, as well as young elementary school students, either in groups of three or five, or accompanied by their parents, going in to buy books. When they come out, nineteen out of ten people are holding bags of books and stationery, and the pen sellers standing at the door will stare at them and ask, "Do you need a pen?"</p>
<p>Walking into these big bookstores and taking a tour, every counter is crowded with people buying books, and the clerks are sweating profusely, too busy to greet customers. Especially the counter selling textbooks is crowded with several groups of people. The wholesale department is filled with male and female teachers from schools who are in charge of general affairs, busy distributing books. The lively scene is rarely seen at ordinary times.</p>
<p>In the Commercial Press's shop, the area displaying children's books is crowded with children looking at books. China Bookstore has a long table filled with primary and secondary school textbooks, and many people are sitting at the table, silently reading, and some are even taking notes, probably teachers choosing textbooks. World Bookstore has selected many useful and cheap books, stacked as high as pagodas. These bookstores often extend their business hours during the school term.</p>
<p>The shop windows of several stationery and instrument stores have also been renovated, with various stationery, sports equipment, and ice skates neatly stacked. There are also advertisements with neon lights or several watercolor paintings to attract customers' attention. One of them even has two giant paintings of "Snow White" placed in the shop window.</p>
<p>Not only are the new bookstores like this, but the used bookstores are also active. These days, there are several new used bookstores on Wenwen Street, and a lot of new wooden boxes and bookshelves have been added to the old ones. The books are also more than in the past few days, and all the useful school books are displayed in different categories. In the first used bookstore, there are several men and women picking through old books. Undoubtedly, the activity of used bookstores is nothing more than a competitor to new bookstores!</p>
<p>In several magazine companies at the intersection of Wangping Street and Fourth Road, the people flipping through picture magazines are also particularly crowded. Presumably, since it is still the winter vacation these days, people who are walking around Cultural Street will take a look when they pass by the magazine companies. But when you walk in, there will be people with smoky faces at the door asking you, "Do you want pornographic pictures?" "Do you want small photos?" making you feel inexplicably disgusted.</p>
<p>Everything, everything, is that Cultural Street, as the winter vacation is about to end, presents a kind of movement after silence!</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 3: Admiring the Remains and Recalling the Old Righteous Man, Opening Literacy Classes and Asking Words of Little Teacher</p>
<p>Miss Jin: "I know! This is because the foundation of society has not been reformed, and there is no way to force it. For example, the three words 'guide,' the noun itself has been ruined. People who hear the noun 'guide' will think of it as a base and dirty profession. But when the folk customs are a little more noble, no one will open a hotel and recruit guides to entertain themselves. Then the bad name of the guide is mostly due to the society at that time that made it degenerate and created its badness. May I ask, what kind of base and dirty profession is there now? At that time, the National Diplomacy Committee also thought that the name 'guide' was not good, and someone suggested changing it to another name. I said at the time, 'It doesn't matter! If someone opens a hotel, or calls for a guide in a dance hall restaurant, I will go. At the very least, I can persuade those bad young people and bad old people to guide them to a good path.' Everyone laughed at my words. Then the three words 'guide' are not bad, so why bother to change them?" He Shuangyu said, "Sister Danyu's words are so pleasant! If the foundation of society is not established well, everything will turn bad. People say: Oranges over the Huai River turn into trifoliate oranges. Why do oranges turn into trifoliate oranges? It is because after crossing the Huai River, its soil is not suitable for planting oranges, so it has to change species. Let's not talk about it! Originally, I always wanted to learn good things, but when I came here, I turned bad. There are also some things that are not good in Europe and America, but China has everything, and most of them are entertainment, gambling, and other things, but China wants to learn everything." He Liyu continued, "Especially our women's clothing can be said to be all imitating Europe and America. Some things are learned well, like cutting hair, freeing breasts, etc., are all correct. But what is the point of wearing high-heeled leather shoes? China's foot-binding for women is a stain on the history of women's circles, and is often ridiculed by foreigners. However, wearing those high-heeled shoes is not necessarily brilliant, making both feet deformed. At that time, the general civilized women in China almost all wore high-heeled leather shoes, and some of them who wore flat-bottomed shoes simply couldn't walk. Secondly, like perming hair, it is also following the Eastern custom, but in various European and American countries, there are various colors of hair, and they only make it curly. Some of them also have naturally curly hair, and they don't have to perm it again, at most they use a comb to curl it. However, like China, the hair of Easterners is uniformly black and straight, but at one time, perming was popular, to learn to be like Europeans and Americans. Sometimes, one's own good hair is permed to a scorched yellow. What does this mean?" (26)</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Process of Shaw's Play Being Adapted into a Movie (Part 1) <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiafeng</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw is one of the world's most opposed people to turning his works into films. If his plays were adapted into movies, they would surely be a great success. Therefore, for twenty years, film companies in England, America, France, and Germany have tried every means to buy the film rights to his novels or plays. Whenever a film producer went to ask him, he would always cleverly answer them: "The film rights to each play cost one million pounds. I will only sell my play to you if you make a silent film for the deaf." Or he would say, "The protagonist in my film must be played by Lloyd George (translator's note: a contemporary British statesman)."</p>
<p>Whenever a film producer asked for permission to make a film of his work, Shaw would always sneer and say, "I am famous enough and don't need any films to add to my glory. I am rich enough and don't need your money. So why should I give my work to film producers? They might ruin them and give me unnecessary trouble."</p>
<p>One by one, the film producers were rebuffed like this and didn't want to bother him anymore. Later, this privilege was obtained by a relatively unknown film producer, while all the famous companies failed. Gabriel Pascal, although it is a French name, he was born in Hungary. He is a journalist, writer, novelist, and film producer. He has worked for many film companies in Hollywood, London, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and Budapest for a long time.</p>
<p>Recently, in Paris, without a penny to his name, he suddenly had an idea and wrote a letter to Shaw, whom he had met on the Adriatic beach two or three years ago, asking for help. The gist of his letter was:</p>
<p>"Sir, perhaps you still remember me. We chatted once in Italy (actually, we chatted for fifteen minutes). Perhaps you still remember that I am now a film producer. I have always been interested in your works, and I am extremely eager to turn one of your plays, especially 'Pygmalion', into a film. Under what conditions will you grant me this privilege? At least, give me one!"</p>
<p>Strangely, Shaw actually remembered this Hungarian and, contrary to his usual habit, gave him a reply. This time, he didn't say anything disappointing like before. He instructed him (Pascal) to find his accountant, "This is a very reasonable person." He is currently traveling in the Netherlands. He told him (the accountant) the address in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>"My only chance is to go to Rotterdam myself!" Pascal said to his only friend in Paris and showed him Shaw's reply letter. "If you can lend me a thousand francs, I can get the film rights to 'Pygmalion' within a week."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Road Hero Dares to Act Recklessly Detective Film Authority Director: Xu Xinfu's Hat Was Snatched <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Yinsi</p>
<p>Chen Charlie's Second Case Back Home Opens?</p>
<p>Famous director Xu Xinfu, has been focusing on detective works for many years and has long formed a style. Such as "A Jade Horse", "Diamond", "Vigorous Dragon and Tiger" and even the recently screened "Pearl Shirt" and other films have made more contributions, and achieved considerable success. And that reputation as the "authoritative director of detective films," is indeed well-deserved, and can be said to be unique at the time! Yesterday, this debt film director actually "personally went on stage" by chance! Staging a funny drama, the situation is like a detective war is opening.</p>
<p>That day "something happened"! Director Xu's car suddenly broke down, so he took a lot of parts and a spare tire, and hurriedly sat on a rickshaw, busy rushing to a car shop to have it repaired quickly. Unexpectedly, when the car was passing Shantou Road, the new felt hat he was wearing suddenly disappeared and separated from his head. Immediately looking back quickly, he saw a person in short clothes taking it in one hand and running quickly into a narrow alley. Because he had a heavy car part pressed on his legs, it was inconvenient to get out of the car for a while, so he could only "watch the flying swan" in the fast march of the rickshaw driver, and just laughed it off.</p>
<p>The Shanghai vernacular calls this "losing a hat". Although Director Xu's loss was limited, it was also a very interesting opportunity to experiment with detective techniques. As for how the case will develop in the future, will it really motivate his "Chen Charlie" to handle this "second case back home" after "Pearl Shirt"? There is no sign of any movement for the time being, and we have to wait for the analysis of the facts.</p>
<p>In addition, Director Xu was originally employed in the Chinese Special Police Force of the Public Concession, and is also a purely voluntary special patrol officer on shift. The "road hero" dared to "catch flies on the tiger's head"; that is also a very funny joke.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Re-screening of "The Living Hell of the Western Front" <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Xinren</p>
<p>"The Living Hell of the Western Front" has been screened in various theaters in Shanghai for a long time. These days, it is being screened at the Zhejiang Grand Theater. The prosperity of advance sales is even greater than before. Because of the continuous screening of four shows day and night, before the audience inside the theater had time to exit, the outside was already crowded, often like a bank run. Therefore, the traffic on Zhejiang Road was once blocked the day before yesterday afternoon, and after many detectives arrived at the scene to suppress it, order was maintained and returned to peace. The biggest reason for this enthusiastic situation is actually another manifestation of the public's support for the War of Resistance. Because the content of "The Living Hell of the Western Front" tells the tragic story of the French and German armies fighting fiercely for nine months in 1916, with hundreds of thousands of casualties. After losing famous cities in a row, the French army finally resisted the powerful enemy and won the final victory; which made people feel very happy to see. Under the current environment, it is difficult for domestic films to have their stimulating performances, and everyone has to use alcohol to relieve their sorrows.</p>
<p>There is a need to be happy, so everyone naturally has more special affection for this type of film!</p>

<p>— By Wen Biao</p>
<p>Dianjie's twin daughters, who first appeared in "Five Blessings Arriving in Battle," have recently met us again in "Five Phoenixes Singing Together." The most lively and beautiful of these five little darlings is Miss Youni. Despite her young age, someone is already planning to marry her. It's the son of a New York businessman, only eight years old. Because he often sees Miss Youni's beautiful image in movies and magazines, he finds her very lovely and moving. So, he boldly wrote her a letter proposing marriage, with the following words:</p>
<p>Dear Youni:</p>
<p>I am the first one preparing to marry you. There is no one in the world who loves you more than I do. In a few years, Roosevelt will retire, and I will succeed him as President. You will be the First Lady. If I ever lead troops into battle myself, you will take over national affairs for me.</p>

<p>Four Types of Dancers, Each With Their Own Merits</p>
<p>"Tears of Flowers," soon to be performed by the Shanghai Drama Society, is Yu Ling's masterpiece after "Women's Apartment." This play has even more gimmicks than "Women's Apartment" and is a tragedy about dancers. The famous film director Wu Yonggang has been specially invited to direct it.</p>
<p>The play depicts:</p>
<p>The first type of dancer, the so-called "red dancer," is very popular in the dance hall. She knows how to present herself well, wearing a gray overcoat. Her dance tickets cost two or three hundred, but who knows that behind her, she has a "dry mama" who only recognizes legal tender and doesn't care about face. This makes the "red dancer's" body not free, her actions not free, and even her love not free.</p>
<p>The second type of dancer, the so-called dancer who is not completely red, is just so-so in the dance hall, but still has some gimmicks. But they want both "face" and "lining" (material benefit). Although they have been through thick and thin and made up their minds, they have to "perfunctorily," "reluctantly," "make do," and "compromise" for the sake of face and for the sake of life. So, they suffer great mental pain.</p>
<p>The third type of dancer, the so-called "scatterbrain," is like the "telephone receivers" that are popular in the dance hall. They are confused themselves, and the dance patrons take advantage of them. But they don't care and often "don't put it in their hearts." So, they are deceived and insulted once, twice… countless times. When it really becomes unbearable, they go crazy. But who pities them!</p>
<p>The fourth type of dancer, the so-called "packaged dancer," is exploited like a packaged worker, played with like a little bird. On the one hand, they suffer abuse and beatings from the boss or their family; on the other hand, they can only swallow their anger and be played with by the patrons. These people only know how to collect dance tickets and hand them in, dreaming of a beautiful marriage. But this dream is always destroyed by the dark forces.</p>

<p>— By Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Singing of an Adopted Son on Stage, Brothers Weeping Below</p>
<p>There is a saying that if you want to get angry, gamble and watch a play. At first glance, this sentence seems to make no sense. Because even a three-year-old child knows that gambling and watching a play are all about entertainment and happiness. Why do I say that you go to gamble and watch a play when you want to get angry? Actually, after I explain the meaning inside, it will be clear. First, let's talk about gambling. No matter if you are gambling on mahjong or dominoes, if you can't draw good tiles or are blocked by the player to your left, or if you encounter the highest hand when you're waiting for a tile, wouldn't you be angry in such a situation? As for watching a play, if you see Yue Shaobao being killed in Fengbo Pavilion or Cao Mengde killing the two princes, wouldn't you be angry? People often throw orange peel teacups at Cao Cao. And isn't it because of the two sentences that the shoemaker said that there is no reason for it?</p>
<p>Being able to act is not only to make you angry, but also to make you cry. Once, when Lao Tan was performing "Sangyuan Jizi" (Adopting a Son in the Mulberry Garden), he suddenly saw a person in the audience weeping loudly on the table. The grief was as if he had lost his parents. A meddling person pulled him aside and asked him if he was having a nervous breakdown. He immediately stamped his feet and said, "Sir, what are you talking about? My crying is because I heard Boss Tan's play and it touched my heart. I discovered my conscience and couldn't help but feel genuine regret. And I want to go home immediately, find my brother, and have a good cry with him." Others saw that he was speaking vaguely and not very clearly, so they repeatedly asked him, "What exactly happened, brother?" It turned out that he had listened to his wife's words and bullied his younger brother for being young, taking all the good family property and forcibly dividing the less valuable real estate and objects to him. Of course, he felt resentful in his heart. As soon as he resisted me with a few words, I immediately showed my elder brother's face and drove him out. The reason for getting angry was to listen to a play to relieve boredom, but who would have thought that Boss Tan's singing and acting could express the true feelings of brotherly love? I sat below and watched and listened, and it was really like thorns on my back, restless every moment.</p>
