<p>社評</p>
<h3>開放長江與日美關係的調整</h3>
<p>關於日軍重行開放長江下游交通一事，日昨已由日本政府發出公告。並正式通知歐美有關各國。據所表示，準備解除南京以下的長江航禁，保留着維持治安與作戰上必要的種種限制；於準備工作何時可以完成，所謂限制又將是些什麼、這在日本沒有宣佈以前，當然無從推測。長江通航問題，爲中日戰事發生後日本與歐美各國間一宗最大的糾紛，歷經有關各國向日本提出多决抗議，都沒有獲得圓滿的解決！現在她自己忽然宣佈將要準備開放長江下游交通，其中自有絕大用意。不過自這項消息發表之後，却並未使英美等國發生重大反響；就是各國在華僑商，除感覺懷疑之外，也都並不表示愉快。可見日本的眞正用意，已不難爲國際人士所洞澈底蘊。</p>
<p>日本一般輿論，還認爲日本政府此舉乃一種巨大的犧牲。例如上週東京國民新聞，就極力反對；謂長江的開放，將使日本自中日戰爭以來的種種努力盡付東流。日昨又著論，謂此一建議若仍不能和緩第三國關係，則野村應辭職以謝國人；足見他們重視此事對於日本影響的重大。日本自侵入長江流域之後，曾組織種種工商會社，企圖獨占長江航業，壟斷長江貿易，以便搜括區域內一切經濟資源；可是事實並不能使她如願以償；偌大的長江區域，日本的軍力怎夠分配；就是日本所占沿江的幾個大都市，各種工商業也始終沒有恢復正常的活動。日本的所謂振興計劃，也在資金缺乏和軍事狀態下不能實現。所以日本封鎖長江交通，並沒有獲得其所預期的巨大利益；縱使日本不加封鎖，對於第三國也未必有從事正常貿易的可能。日本這决宣佈準備恢復長江下游交通，自稱其所犧牲怎樣重大，實是過甚其詞；她的眞正用意，無非想藉此以取得較大的交換代價。若第三國不能滿足她的慾望，此後的開放怕就遙遙無期；即使日本能取得相當代價，而實行開放，亦必與珠江通航無多區別。要想自由航行貿易，根本上有待日本放棄侵略或侵略全盤失敗之後。</p>
<p>據日本官方意見，這次宣佈準備開放長江下游，似乎完全在調整對美外交關係、以便繼續獲得軍火供給，避免美國採取經濟報復政策，故不得不設法結好美國，希圖締結新商的。但就事實觀察，關係不僅是美國，所以這也是日本想要調整整個外交的辦法。原來在過去的中國航業上，向以英國的勢力爲最大：如果恢復長江通航，當以對英國爲最有利益。這就很明顯表現日本的目的，也在聯絡英法等國，想從英法兩國取得相當的代價。不久之前，日輪山陽丸，得自英國封鎖中滿載德貨返國，以及最近所傳英日天津談判的進展，這裏面都不無蛛絲馬跡可尋。此外她還可以藉此表示日本與英美等國關係逐漸好轉；借此姿勢，亦可以迫令蘇聯改善對日的態度，這又是她的副作用。</p>
<p>即就日本企圖緩和日美關係一點來說，亦可見她的淺陋無聊：美國對日本的再三抗議之中，業已明白指出日本破壞了九國公約，然則僅僅解除長江下游短短一段的航禁，又豈足以代表中國門戶的開放？倘以實利主義的觀點來說；中日戰前美輪進出中國港口的，不過百分之二；而航行長江的，差不多完全沒有美國商輪。因此，開放長江下游，在航業本身上可說與美國絕無關係。便就商業權利言：僅祗南京以下一段長江航路，又有什麼貿易可以經營！長江三角洲上的重要產品，無一不在日本獨占統制運銷之下；他如碼頭設備和內地交通工具等項，倘若不擬給予第三國利用，這與始終未封鎖的華北各港，有何分別；則所謂開放到底是怎樣開放！這是絕大疑問。久經開放的珠江，在實際上又何嘗有外商航業貿易的自由！在這種狀態下開放長江下游交通，美國又將有什麼利益可圖呢？</p>
<p>可是日本準備開放長江下游的希望却是過奢：她竟希望美國能因日本此舉而續訂美日商的，並改正美國人民對於「東亞新秩序」的解釋；不僅是要求美國無條件的繼續供給她以侵華的車火，同時還想美國承認她的解除長江下游航禁爲合法的行動，間接承認她的所謂「中國新秩序」。這種類乎反要求的解除航禁，將祇有使美國在華繼續損失更大的權益，並且無異於使美國簽字承認、永遠捐棄重大的權益。如此淺陋無聊的嘗試。深信不是美國朝野所會接受的</p>
<h3>日美交涉將在兩京同時進行　日大使崛內將與赫爾會談　開放長江事尙未提出保證</h3>

<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨於新聞報道席上答記者問、謂日本僅表示其有開放長江之意、並未提出具體保證及辦法、赫爾並稱、彼對美駐日大使格魯之報告、尚未研究完畢、（二十日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　日本外相野村、昨日向內閣報告與美國大使格魯會晤之情形、及開放長江一部分之計劃、政界人士歸納美日談判之結果如下（一）日本準備開放長江及珠江已明白承認第三國在華權利、（二）日本希望美日商的滿期後、美國至少能贊同過渡時期之臨時商的、（三）日本亦承認英國之權利、關於天津及貨幣問題、必須有所讓步、（四）英美兩國業已與「新秩序」發生聯繫、因此、英美兩國承認中日戰事所產生之新局勢之問題、並不重要、（二十日海通電）</p>

<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>愛情是健康生活中的花朵，身體越發健壯，這種花朶也越發美麗。「健壯男子才配談愛情」！這是每個靑年都應牢記在心的格言。吾則如痿弱無能的男子而談愛情，就等於自討苦吃！男子漢，大丈夫，本應該健壯雄偉，精力豐足，爲女性所愛，妻妾所歡，而今何以痿弱無能，淪陷在人間地獄中！？這據醫學上的論斷：類多因早年浪漫，不知自愛，犯有自凟惡癖，或同性鷄奸，或遺精失治，或早婚縱慾，或多妻荒淫，或憂勞斵傷等行爲，把我人生命源泉的生殖腺內分泌液（卽精液）耗用枯竭，於是凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，頭腦脹痛，耳鳴眼花，腰酸背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，腎虧乏嗣，未老先衰等症象即不一而足。此種虧弱男子，每外强中乾，或竟面黃肌瘦，萎靡不振，不特求學不進，求業難成，有陷於失學失業的危險；就是在男女之間，欲談戀愛，每爲女性所棄，陷於失戀！，在婚後的夫婦生活上更將爲妻不滿，難以永好，由此而演出夫婦問之勃谿爭吵，私通私奔，離婚自殺等種種悲劇者，豈不亦時有所聞？或竟因上述症象失治，致短命妖殤，遺下了孤兒寡妻者，那眞慘絕人寰！愛情旣爲健康生活中的花朶，就應用以來增進健康則可，若荒淫縱慾有損健康，則切不可。惟萬一因當年無知，致患上述症象之一部或全部者，允應及早作澈底根治。</p>
<p>治療之法，據世界名醫及余等多年經騐，均以服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。因此劑品質最名貴，功效最確實，爲任何類似製劑所不及。服後於二十四小時內卽可生精補腎，健腦活血，連服不斷，則更助長發育，滋養神經，必於短期內根治各症，冬春常服，則延年益壽，反老還童。惟有遺精症者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲等大藥房均售每匣實價兩元，購時務須認淸希米晚字樣）以固精　，制止遺波，則收效允速！</p>
<p>患者盛志强辨，粤籍，年廿八，業進出口商，因早婚新傷，致患遺精，早洩症，有時竟陽痿不舉，腦腎虧損殊劇。曾服市上各種成藥，均無效，因之生趣索然！上月經其友介紹至本診所診治，經詳察其病狀後，即囑其購「生殖素」三打，「希米脫氏固精片」一打，使之兼服，幷施用電療注射等法，爲時月餘，頃已百病霍然，體重增加五磅，精力豐足，夫婦恩愛又勝於新婚矣！</p>

<p>不必諱言，無論怎樣敦厚老誠的男子，假如看到風姿綽約，肉感動人的健美女性，他也要注目凝視，心裏起着一種莫名的愛悅的。健美女性所以這樣可貴，而值得人們愛慕，這不能不歸功於胸前的一對乳峯，因爲女子的乳峯，正似琉璃塔上的預尖，沒有了它，那麼這個塔身無論怎樣精巧玲瓏，總覺得不成樣子。一個女性而沒有高聳的乳峯在胸前起伏生姿，那她縱有西子王嬙之美，亦祇多被人稱上一聲『病態美人』，不爲時代男子所重，自無福做新家庭的主婦，更不必仰望做富家闊太太。所以現在歐美各國的年輕婦女，她們對於愛美，已不肯浪費無謂的脂粉之資，而注重於乳峯一部的發育，她們對乳峯已視作第二生命，一有萎癟狀態，無不立即以德國『女用生殖素』爲挽救。因乳祟萎癟的主要原因，爲卵巢機能遭受白帶，痛經，自凟貧血，營養不良，多產虧弱等症所摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用所致。故最對症的療法，自以服雄壯動物的卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』爲最可靠。此劑歷經中西各大名醫負責證明，認爲藥性和平，功效偉大，不分寒暑，均可常服，如在冬至前後繼續進服，厥功更偉，不但可使萎癟的乳峯，逐漸高聳，同時且能調整月經，增加體溫，旺盛新陳代謝作用，產生多量新生細胞，使肌膚柔滑，面色紅潤，靑春長駐。</p>
<h3>遺精症的培補療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精不是病，可是日子久了會送命！尤其是在此冬臘時期，所謂「冬不藏精，春必病瘟」。遺精症雖非大病，却是有萬分危險的！因爲我們體內的精液，就是所謂生殖腺內分泌液，此種內分泌液，實是主宰我人健康，性情，生殖，發育及壽命的主要腺體，所以精足的人，必然體健熱情，而奮發有爲，同時亦爲女性理想中的伴侶，婚後生活，眞是幸福無窮！可是無知的靑年，往往不知精液的貴重，每因性的衡動，或爲惡劣環境所引誘，犯有手淫惡癖，或早婚縱慾，摧殖了性神經，使精關鬆弛後，必繼起着遺精症。此在聰明的靑年，或即知覺悟，一面戒絕手淫縱慾等惡習，一面必設法治愈其遺精；然在大多數糊塗靑年，因遺精無痛無癢，不以爲疾病，而一味因循失治，待到發育機能停滯，新陳代謝作用减退，而爆發着腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰痠背痛，腎痿早洩，局部短小如指等症狀後，那就難免要自誤誤人了！世間靑年，因患上述各症，致求學不進，習藝無成，求愛失戀，婚後的夫婦生活，更因爲妻不滿而演出勃谿失和，私通私奔，離婚自殺等種種悲劇者，亦多不勝計！</p>
<p>遺精的治療方法，據余多年經騐，則唯有速服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」以鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，則當夜即可收安眠止遺之神效。輕症者連服數日，必可除根。惟遺精已久而有上述虧弱症象者，除仍須積極服「希米脫氏固精片」外，更須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖紫」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，冬春常服，必可根治各症，益臻健康。患者如能親來本診所兼施電療注射等新療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>此事評述之不滿、蓋因日方之聲明、措辭含混所致、未知尊見如何、」發言人答、「關於開放長江之事、在本身方面、尚未有明晰之規定、故在聲明之中、不能含糊也、惟日軍在揚子江流域已盡力改善一切、故覺開放之舉、為可以考慮也、」</p>

<p>上海商業女子銀行與重慶路慶餘里房客涉訟遷讓一案、業經高二分院民庭數度審理、已屆辯論之期、昨晨九時半、又由韓祖植·沈鴻·章慶瀾三推事開庭</p>
<p>續開辯論</p>
<p>房客方面代理律師到袁仰安·蘇景麒、而女子銀行代理律師袁漢雲等亦到案、參加人貧兒敎養院委左德齊律師到庭、庭上先就女子銀行提出房客有數人名字不符諸點、問袁仰安律師、據袁律師答稱、名姓不符、係女千銀行在原審起訴時所寫錯、現特將錯誤之處、逐一</p>
<p>予以更正</p>
<p>女子銀行藉此攻擊、顯屬不合、應請查照法院執達員之調查報告爲根據云、次由蘇律師續開辯論、略謂（一）新設據已將原判決之基礎根本動搖、（二）展期合同訂立之期日、應以法院保全證據時所得之合同原本爲準、女子銀行事後提出者、其年月日係事後另塡、不能採信、（三）本案應受</p>
<p>展期契約</p>
<p>之拘束、房屋陳舊非女子銀行原請求之原因云云、繼貧兒院左律師聲述訂立展期契的之動機及原因、謂仍希望女子銀行在三年內從速翻造、末由袁仰安律師與女子銀行及貧兒院之代理律師互相駁詰、略稱、貧兒院旣己允許女子銀行</p>
<p>緩期三年</p>
<p>翻造、則卽遲至民國三十一年一月一日動工翻造、貧兒院亦無利害關係之可言、其參加理由、顯不成立、總之現在時值非常、一旦使三千餘房客遷讓、試問呌彼等何處容身、故女子銀行即欲行使其契的之權利、依法不應在對房客最有損害時行之云云、庭論本案辯論終結、定期十二月二十五日上午十一時宜判、</p>

<h3>中美慈善籃球賽　中華隊組織經過　華聯球員拒絕出席之眞相　體育精神與運動道德掃地</h3>
<p>第三屆申報盃中美慈善籃球賽、此次關於中華代表隊之組織選拔經過如下、本屆因欲避免各球隊對各該隊入選人數多少、有所爭執、故選拔尖員會純以絕對中立之立塲、不以隊爲單位、選擇適宜之球員、復由主辦當局對各球隊個人分別邀請、所發表之人選、難或不能盡美盡善、但滄海遺珠、自屬難免、各方面皆以國際榮譽及義舉關係、一致　以同情、獨李震中陳學崇沈聿恭等三人發生異議、謂華聯隊員入選過少、該隊之任相成包松圓、有入選之必要、選拔委員會以爲旣經決定、如徇一隊之請、而擅加增益、則將何以對付其他各隊、復商諸李等、李表示主辦當局雖邀請各個人參加、但彼等爲華聯體育會會員、有請示於會長嵇鯤生之必要、於是商諸嵇氏、豈知嵇氏態度更這堅決、提出該隊徐兆熊包松圓任相成三球員、謂非入選不可、連已入選者、共計七人、隊長亦須由華聯球員擔任、吾則寗願退出罷賽、跡近要挾、於是往返磋商、嵇氏絲毫無同情之讓步、最後復由友人用個人之情感、促李等顧全大局、出席比賽、但李等竟始終不覆、其態度傲慢可見、夫所選拔之球員之優劣、固一問題、　欲以藝聯整個球隊共計七人、代表出席、是否適當及能　充裕、則爲共見之事、以華聯之敗於小熊一戰看來、則更成疑問、球員旣非物品、萬無豢養運自由俱失之理、提倡體育、亦決非如此包辦運動員、欲成球員托辣斯、更屬荒謬、自戰後體育行政機關相繼西撤、或停止工作之際、允應有遵守體育紀律發揚運動道德之精神、如乘此國難、不顧運動道德、則當爲中華體育界共棄之、</p>

<p>右表所列志願、係專指后方各校而言、其在內地投考學生以上海各校爲志願者、因爲規定所不許、故未列入、表列志願人數、總計與投人數不符、就是這個緣故、我們試就右表來說、以中大及西南聯大爲志願者、佔全部錄取生或保送生四分之一以上、這樣分發、如何小困難呢、試再以考生志願學系及其科別而論、允足見其集中之一般、茲將第一志願科系及人數列表如左、</p>

<h3>糧食高白粳依然不出樣　崑山次粳竟售限價　市塲已成洋米之天下　民食不虞無米以為炊</h3>
<p>昨日內地各區來源、仍在某方統制之下、所到惟有大批洋米、絡繹抵埠、致人心較懈、兼之般作客雖有添購、尚不敢多備、故交易祇多零星、尚鮮大宗、囤戶及客販、雖以厚薄粳高貨、身本綦重、依然不肯出樣外、但中段及身骨較弱之貨、尚求脫手、且大批洋米悉在拋售、一時市上籌碼、頓呈供過於求、進貨價遂難維持、售方均貶價相邀、所以結果各貨成交寥寥、全市統計不過三四千包、而行情若厚薄粳表面雖仍似無上落、實則以優劣相別、已較前市降低三五角、計收盤崑山次粳同里白粳均爲四十元、黎盛中粳三十九元、靑泗特薄四十元、大市者三十九元半、楓嘉及南港早晚稻三十八元半、蘆尖及羊尖貨稀獨平、計開蘆尖三十八元半、羊尖三十七元半、江北尖依限開出三十三元（詳見市價欄）至於西貢尖市貨最豐、貶價較大、以三十五元七角至三十五元之價而論、比前市已跌落半元至一元、碎米三十一元、决至二十九元、其跌風依然相仿、東京砶尖三十二元、三十一元半、則與前無甚上落、乃以價廉與西貢米相別太虧、故一般貨主不肯相提並論、再於輕脫、是得維持原價、但一方成交亦祇三四百包而巳、常帮白元四十元、丹陽白元三十九元、亦屬平平耳、</p>
<p>洋米連日進口不已、民食絕對無虞、昨日又有太古公司南髯輪、由西貢裝來洋米六千零七十七包、又由香港運來二千八百八十九包、共計八千九百六十六包、昨晚已起卸完竣、</p>
<h3>麥價繼漲增高　麵粉明定暗緊</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市明定暗堅、查二號粉廠盤仍爲八元七角、各廠爲維持本街起見、依然儘量供給、惟回籠貨形勢復緊、蓋緣市傳麥價已達十五元一角半之高峯、人心似覺好轉、是以日廠粉買氣又濃、鳳凰牌十二月份初開八元〇五•六分、旋至一角八分、一月份亦由八元四角六·七分至八元五角、統市成交的計四萬餘包、本客各半去路、實銷的佔四份之二、今日出口有四千五百包運香港、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市仍見挺俏、高麥十五兀之價、已有超過一角五分之說、皆由於內地價昂、及來源缺乏所致、市塲交易共計五車、計開管店及蘇崑麥十五元至十四元七角半、福新阜豐兩廠合辦蘇錫鎭江麥四千五百包、價十五元至十四元九角、浦東麥十四元五角半、又有豆子一千八百六十包、運往香港</p>
<h3>油市　豆油暴跌　眞相宣露</h3>
<p>前日（十九日）所開豆油暴跌之行市、本報雖有市價報告、未有新聞發表者、因審察過去兩日來之市氣、其疲弱之態、尚不應如此懸殊、因故從略、昨日不出本報所料、市塲中人心騷動、大起問罪之師、然無風不起浪、當日（十九日）收市時、曾有一批暗盤交易、但所開之價頗秘密、風聞較上日之價修削十元耳、刻下前途潛勢、雖一般有力份子、一意把持、然實銷不起、來源蟬聯、且有環境牽制、亦恐難以挽回此不振之局、</p>
<h3>糖市　刁青須結外匯說</h3>
<p>昨洋糖無甚軒輊、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧五十九元半、外棧五十九元七角至五角、五月份到者五十九元、轉口貨仍四十八元、太古車白略小、西棧B嘜六十元、東棧五十九元半、西棧CW嘜五十九元半、CX嘜五十九元、DY嘜五十八元半,HX嘜五十八元、H嘜車赤四十五元、荷赤四十六元半、本綿白及一號冰俱無變更、國糖開出興化靑數十包、四十二元、普通棉赤四十六元、其餘呌價較增、但未成交、並聞漳州消息、自二十九年一月一日起、各貨由漳出口、均須先結外匯、如是則刁靑亦難例外、又昨日由香港運來糖有四百七十包、</p>
<h3>金融　進口商結期現外匯</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、經連鬆四日後、本日始見回頭、然無其他消息、全因洋行界結款繁多故也、半日過程、晨開英略報緊、美則平平、少頃沙遜稍塞同時港方亦賣、但荷蘭有利等均有吃胃、故鬆勢有限、斯時英金爲四辦士七六五六二五、美匯爲七元八四三七五、不久各大洋行界需要殷切、紛向市上猛扒、且一般範圍較小之各進口商、亦暗中向外行購結、加以銀行界均乘勢扳價、未及半小時、英金即緊達四辦士六八七五、美滙亦軟至七元六五六二五、迨十時半後、扒風漸息、市勢頓形轉定、直至收盤、未見若何變動、收盤價英金仍爲四辦士六八七五、美匯七元六八七五、結果較上日、回軟〇七八一二五及一二五、期貨潛勢、仍與現貨相仿、</p>
<p>連鬆四日始回緊</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長〇六二五、遠期長一二五、紐約銀價升三七五、倫敦生金未定、匯兌英對美·對法均平、對滬昂〇六二五、美對英勿動、對滬升五分、對法大一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士七五、美匯七元八一二五、較前收英緊〇一五六二五、美無榮辱、開後沙遜首塞於市、港電亦有賣出、但爲數均屬有限、且荷蘭有利等吃胃頗佳、故市勢所鬆極微、計沙遜售予荷蘭現貨英金四辦士七六五六二五、及正月份英金四辦士七五、繼之又與港電吐予大通荷蘭有利某行等現貨美匯七元八一二五、時滙豐買價、曾還過七元八四三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大〇•二五、此後各大洋行現期結款頻繁、且範圍較小之洋行界亦暗中扒吸、加以港電等中止供塞、致爲狀頓見步軟、迨至十時一刻光景、英金已軟至四辦士六八七五、美匯亦緊達七元六五六二五、嗣後扒者漸少、狀况遂形平定、直至午刻、未見若何更動、午收銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士六八七五、美匯七元六八七五、本月份英金四辦士六七一八七五、美匯七元六五六二五、正月份英金四辦士六五六二五、美匯七元五六二五、結果比隔昨現期英均軟〇七八一二五、美俱硬一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港申匯升六元</p>
<p>香港二十日電、今晨匯市開盤穩定、各匯與昨收比較、均無榮辱、十時五十五分申匯現貨升五元、爲三百十七元、十一時三十分申匯現貨再升一元、爲三百十八元、市面穩定、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英長美不動</p>
<p>天津二十日電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英匯現貨鬆〇六二五、爲四便士半、美滙及申匯不動、仍爲七元三七五與一百〇五元半、「聯鈔」暗盤續昂二角半、爲九十三元七角半、</p>
<h3>外幣轉俏　美金票升爲十三元</h3>
<p>昨日美美金鎊、需要復殷、金票客戶趁賤吸納、市價回漲頗勁、港幣供給仍暢、市况軟弱、法郎安南因旅行需要、市價堅挺、日票需要復盛、市價緊俏、晚市爲一元三角零五釐、鮮票供給見增、市况微軟、晚市爲一元一角一分二釐、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升一元、英金票升七角、美升一角三分、港幣降一分、法郎升二釐、安南升二分、共他未更、</p>
<h3>匯市轉鬆為緊　現金重入佳境</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、隨滙市之回軟而得轉向佳境推進、結果回漲三十六元、惟業者均審愼從事、不肯逢漲買進加碼、至當日經過初開依舊疲弱、乃因外匯此時略現鬆態、某錢兌業撳價力賣、遂爲四千〇九十元低價開盤、計小十八元、繼以某銀號等代客搜入、拉起卅元、奈銀樓帮及某錢兌業重塞、復小至四千一百〇五元、此後匯市轉緊、遂使買戶精神一振、金號證券帮及錢兌業等入市競買、價乃飛漲達四千一百五十元高峯、旋以外匯轉定、多方心思不長、獲利緩緩出籠、故迄午收稍落爲四千一百四十元、午後情况平庸、祇有七元上落、結果以四千一百四十四元收盤、全天交易的二千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛大五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲卅六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開匯市微鬆、及某錢兌業代客撳價賣出、開市遂做小十八元、售予證券帮三十兩、爲四千〇九十元、少頃因價廉買者陡擁、某金號及某銀號競買允力、不久即拉起卅元、金號進銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千一百二十元、嗣因銀樓帮續塞、且某錢兌業復起賣風、遂又撳小至四千一百〇五元、其時滙市忽報回緊、加以緊度頗速、人心頓振、證券帮金號錢兌業等互相放盤收買、未幾即飛躍四十五元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百五十元、此後外滙轉定、且某銀號多頭心思不長、乘高獲利出籠、立回小十五元、金號出錢兌業二十兩爲四千一百三十五元、後金號等雖賣、但證券帮及某現金號納胃尚佳、頭寸平衡、價遂盤旋於叫千一百四十元左右、直至收盤時、證券帮進錢兌業十兩、仍告四千一百四十元作午收價、午後潛勢平靜、首開抬高五元、銀樓帮錢兌業十兩、　四千一百四十五元後某錢兌業亦來撈進、續漲叫元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千一百四十九元、入後散戶及金號吐出、步小七元、錢兌業吐予銀樓帮十兩、爲叫千一百四十二元、後金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百四十四元、作晚收價、結果比上日漲起三十六元、全天六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛高五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十五元、迨至十時半掛高五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减小十五元之譜、</p>
<h3>新輔幣券那裏去了？</h3>
<p>自批發行分幣券，以爲一矯前弊，分配於各銀行及各業，可得大量流通於市面，但據所聞所見，各業所領得者無多，各銀行所領得者聞亦不鉅，而市上所流通，仍是破舊或新發之電車，公共汽車代價券，分幣券眞可謂偶一見之，不可多得，發行一百萬　之分幣券，如單以一分券論，則可有一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇張，更退一步，以一分券五分券，各爲五十萬元計算，一分券亦應有五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇張，五分券有一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇張，市上頓有此大宗籌碼，決不至仍用代價券，而何以分幣券終少見，此非關鎭於各方面之庫房或私人之箱篋十，即爲發行手　大有考慮之餘地。</p>
<p>以言一元鈔及角幣券，比來所見，無非殘破腐爛不堪之紙幣，惡貨幣驅逐良貨幣，眞是隨處可以應用，乃查閱報章猶在運日宣傳，新一元鈔到多少萬元，輔幣券不虞缺乏，而事實如彼，殆亦貨不暢其流歟。</p>
<h3>銀行活期昨日結息</h3>
<p>每年六月底及十二月底爲銀行辦理半年結帳之期、六月及十二月一十日爲活期儲蓄及往來存款半年結息之期、自戰事發生以後、各行定期存款與儲蓄頗多轉作活期、以備支用者、故昨日（二十日）各行辦理本期活存結息、內部甚爲繁忙、一部份銀行活期存戶衆多者、其辦事人員需至深夜才能辦竣、至於存款人自今日起可將存摺持向銀行登息、今日若不登摺、於下次交存或支取存款時補登亦可云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債漲力不繼　外股待諸耶誕後</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况又超疲軟、人氣又復不振、仍再走入盤旋状况、交易因此亦漸漸遜色、形勢如此不能振作、實緣基本上不得確實之栽培、故暫時實難有多大榮枯之可言、昨日初開、人心尚堅、因聯和稍有進胃、丙種曾做八元一角半高價、旋以信昌潤利大通久豐賣出爲多、丙種頓破人八元關、人心因此頓虛、故午後形勢愈覺不振、各債均疲莫能興、四十號頗有脫手、結果一致小一三角左右、成交總數的五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後</p>
<p>股票交易、成交開明地產公司（前設於城內九畝地　股　百股、價爲三元四角、（票面每股十元）</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、殊乏生氣、價格變動甚微、設目下外滙趨軟、市况似將暫告寗靜、俟假　過後或有轉機、</p>
<h3>紗花　外棉下墮　本花看疲　通火機跌二三元</h3>
<p>本棉交易大爲减縮、此因海外印美棉市一致傾向下墮、以致人心愈挫、同業中心思看疲、嫌其價格已入高境、暫守一步、再當舉動、所以市價帶弱、通花火機兩項售盤比上日跌去二三元之譜、蘇北來源計通花五百七十三包、常陰沙六百五卞八包、北沙三百八十包、茲將現棉售開之盤列左、</p>
<p>通州　一七〇·〇〇　申新進　五〇〇包</p>
<p>常陰沙一六八·〇〇　申新進　五〇〇包</p>
<p>通州　一六五·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>草包　一五五·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>通花　一六八·〇〇　申新進　五〇〇包</p>
<p>通花　一六四·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨晨開盤之初、即形軟疲、加之利物浦及孟買來電俱告下落、各方交易俱擬獲利了結、靜度聖誕及新年、後南方帮又在市套賣、因之市况疲甚、造成最低價收盤、較之上日跌落二十磅音、印度連同預測跌十餘羅比、埃及跌四十磅音、利物浦跌六七便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉現貨交易、殊爲靜寂、中外廠商皆然、同業間前購之紐約交易所之期貨、現已獲得厚利、彼等亦擬仿照歐美之法、獲利了結、然後歡度聖誕及歲尾、故昨日起同業之期貨業已開始陸續了結矣、茲將昨日外棉市價、以美滙七元六八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>實需太滯　棉紗壓力重重</h3>
<p>紗市益人盤旋之境、但海外棉市跌風漸起、故新買者益呈歧途徬徨之象、心思不及昔日之堅決、加之年關將屆、結束時期已近、商業曾有一度停頓、故市情較爲渙散、因之客銷依然沉悶無勁、惟同業大都皆在多頭地位、吸收之額亦足、當然不看小也、根本問題、還係實需太滯、壓力較重、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因美棉大落、且跌風尤熾、人氣稍虛、二十支雙馬開價七百十一元、比上日要跌九元、但價低之後、多頭反形擯持不動、故市况又見冷靜茶久、旋即聞外匯改縮、買風忽起、形勢復見熱鬧、市盤徐徐回升、至七百二十二元、但價高後賣者又衆、收盤之後再小、查半日間成交統計一千一百八十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌一元、天女跌二元、雙地球漲二元、今日有紗三百件運港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3>大衣呢需要旺</h3>
<p>大衣呢存底日見减缺、而當今天冷、需要大旺、友誼天官圖倒純毛及肇基老公茂協利等灰搶大衣呢銷塲更活、同業大批發戶、大半均相繼售罄、市價遂堅漲異常云、</p>

<h3>五金　行節鋼條　行盤飛漲</h3>
<p>久已岑寂之竹節鋼條市面、昨本街建築帮納胃甚健、而烟臺靑島以及天津諸帮採辦亦力、市貨不够分配、同業居奇、允以門市少量買戶、討價允貴、昨躉批交易竟達三百數十噸之巨、創各貨漲價後之新紀錄、故人心堅硬、標準行盤三四分每噸八百元、五分至一寸七百五十元出零、均比前市好起一二十元、查該貨因滬存不多、後市看再漲</p>
<h3>絲茶　茶市清淡</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶歐莊均以日來滙率頻鬆、而華商索價較前尤昂、是以多持觀望態度、全市僅保昌永興等行、買進針眉八十餘箱、售價自八十二元至九十四元、與前無上落、此外秀眉花香等貨、平津帮購去百餘包、扯價四十七八元、行情亦佳、又茶葉今日有二十九件、運往香港、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論緊張</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>與閑適相反的是緊張的情調。所謂緊張的意義：一是外象（環境的事物）的緊張，一是內心的緊張。先由於外象的紛亂和動蕩，或一件事態的倉猝來臨，激起內心的情緒，感覺和聯想，間接便有一種緊張的心理產生。外象和內心的緊張可以說是同屬一種境界，差別祇是表裏有點不同。我們知道，當緊張的時候，要做一個『冷靜的旁觀者』不大可能。然而文學的製作原則偏偏又告訴我們：你須要做一個旁觀者。事實上阿爾卑斯山的遊客，儘管看見路上的標語，而真能靜心觀賞山景者却很少。但從回憶中也一樣好掘取。真正的動人心魄瑰奇而偉大的素材往往是在緊張之後重現的，人世的動蕩和紛亂，一反平時沉悶的生活方式。</p>
<p>外象奔湊的結果，使古井的心境動蕩起來。原來蟄伏着的種種情感在這時蠢動了，一發而為靈感。生命所受的壓力大，反動力更大。石鏨石而成火花，照韓愈的說法，也可以說是石頭的不得其平，假火而鳴（廣義的）的一例。這靈感是在被迫於千鈞重壓下的反動一剎那間芸芸萬象約目送手揮，決不同於『悠然見南山』或『帳然吟式微』的靈感方式，這是人類受動蕩紛亂的外象反映於內心生命力量的猛進。誠如泰納所言，牠是一種執拗有力的作用。不僅隱伏在個人的潛意識中，牠更受時代和種族影響，『由這種情勢所影響的力，世代相傳連綿不斷地受着屈服和熏陶。』翻開古史來，這類事實極多。西班牙人反摩罕默德的十字軍，對摩爾人的驅逐，猶太人的掠奪，宗教裁判所的設置，和加特力教戰爭等等都是例子。在外象上牠們表現為流血的反抗，虔誠的追求，政治的組織和軍事的訓練，反映到文學上則是如火如荼的充滿復雜的撼人心靈的祈求與排斥，世代傳留下的精神傾向，自己意識的潛伏，外象和內心相混的一種動亂心境，便無異是一面縮小的動亂的時代影子。而一個文人過了動亂的一年，抵得十年平靜生活的體騐。像杜甫由賊中竄至鳳翔一路上所作的『詩史』之詩，文天祥『指南錄』，高爾基『四十年代』之一的『燎原』，都充分表示一個短時期內的亂動的生活。緊張的生活形態，湊集在比例較短的時間內牠們的穿插連續，又極其波譎雲詭。</p>
<p>一幅如火如荼的絢爛的圖畫展開在我們面前，山陰道上，目不睱接，恰是很好的比喻。遭遇着這樣空前緊張的生活，一不留心，我們的眼睛便要給這過分刺眼的顏色和刺耳的聲音迷亂。在這個險惡但也平夷，醜陋但也美麗的圈子裏，將自己浸在邱壑中去分享，又須將『生活』的畫幅提開，變為觀照。你力求光明而爭火炬，灼傷手臂，亦不所惜，但果真僅灼傷手臂，又有何益。你除感受一時的痛楚外，還須將熊熊的火炬聳然高舉，在體騐緊張以後，更能觀照緊張距離得遠遠的，從旁作鑑別，改造的工夫。</p>
<h3>四百里征程　—戰地追記—</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>事情真出於意外，不到半年的山中生活，因為某項使命的驅策，便不得不重上征程，『讓我暫時和締交未久的朋友告別吧！』準備出發的前夕，的確有點黯然，自從投入大別山的懷抱中，一切都感到新鮮和愉快，物質條件雖然不能使人滿意，可是這蜿蜒巍峨的世界，却涵孕着活躍的生命，無限的力量，以及光明的前途，或許誰也不願輕棄牠的愛撫吧？</p>
<p>在九月下旬一天的早晨，終於拔步登程了，細雨那麼飄灑着，山峰都被吞沒於雲霧裏面，祇有一縷縷的白烟，從深坳中吐出來，表示着農村還在早炊。承馮曉鐘的厚意，給我代雇了一名引路的響導，於是渡過西郊的沙溪，向夫子嶺前進。這時，往河南的路綫，早已阻斷了，所以只得取道湖北的麻城，預計每天步行四十里，下月初便可到達武昌，然後乘車入湘；但戰事正在宋埠發生，能不能通過火綫，乃是當前的難題，『為了要完成使命，怎麼可以顧慮呢？』我自己鼓勵着。</p>
<p>深秋的時節，日子特別短，彷彿在催促着行人不要浪費光陰似的，剛才到了丁家埠，已經向午時候了。這里，是立煌的負郭首鎮，寬廣的街道兩旁，排列着百餘間整齊的房屋，車摩轂擊，非常繁榮；然而這是一月前的形態，如今出現在眼前的，變成斷壁殘垣，完全是坵墟了。『他媽的，炸到這樣光景啦！』響導像驚奇又像憤怒地說。</p>
<p>『莫怒！他們會重新創造的！』我不由不安慰着他。</p>
<p>牛食畈打尖，雨還沒有停，天色已垂暮了，說也奇怪，全鎮找不到一個老百姓，祇剩下街梢頭的破廟中，還住着幾個僧人，幸而『佛門弟子』慈悲為懷，要不然，烤火，煮水，做飯，便束手無策了。</p>
<p>長夜過去，繼續　行，經李集，小河，而至斑竹園，恰巧廣西青年戰地服務團也路過這里，總算打破了征程的寂寞。領隊黃小姐，如果沒有和她談話，誰也不會知道是少女的；她有着壯健的體格，堅毅的精神，動人的詞令。</p>
<p>『聽說宋埠已開火了……？』我問道。</p>
<p>她似乎沉默一下，搖搖頭說：『沒有那麼快吧？』接着，便反問我為什麼要離開大別山，以及到長沙去的目的，好像盤問間諜似的。後來，我知道她是廣西南平縣人，曾在『桂大』讀過書，自從戰事爆發以後，她的長兄曾自動入伍，已在徐州殉國。</p>
<p>由斑竹園西行，過長嶺關，天時只才放晴，但氣溫突然降低，剪刀般的西北風，從四襲來，在試騐着人們的熱度有沒有隨之降落；尤其是濾涉山溪的時候，寒冷徹骨的流水，時常會使你却步的；然而我們終於克服了自然的環境，很快的到達了六米河。</p>
<p>『宋埠慘遭轟炸……，』這是出現在鎮上的壁報，路人都帶着憤恨的臉色，在嘖嘖地談論着。</p>
<h3>街頭流浪</h3>
<p>— 璐江</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>躑躅在街頭，望着空中浮雲，風輕輕地吹來。</p>
<p>掠一下額際的短髮，重又低頭凝視沾滿了灰塵的黑鞋，手按着袋口里僅存的一張五元法幣。—心頭沉沉地。</p>
<p>從那邊投來了一個熟詣的微笑；於是，躍着輕快的步武，很快地。—手被輕輕地而又熱情的握住了。</p>
<p>『朋友！你好？在哪個學校里當教？』多麼爽朗的聲調，然而，被問者的心却開始發痛了。</p>
<p>『我嗎？失業！』無可奈何地回了她一個苦笑，接下來是輕微的太息。</p>
<p>怔着了，凝望着失意的臉龐，半晌。—還依稀記得過去那副聰明福氣的眸子呢！然而，現在……</p>
<p>『我狼狽得可憐嗎？你看？』苦笑着。</p>
<p>『？』回答的是朋友底凝望，懷疑而又同情似地。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>誰又會相信？在一位老師的幫助下，好容易拿到一隻飯碗僅五個月，又給別人接替了。</p>
<p>自家是帶着一點倔强的個性的，不愛湊拍人，這也許觸怒了『上司』？雖然自問並不曾有過一點疏忽，對於自己的教育任務，『戰戰兢兢，如履薄冰。』然而，她的收獲是一個『沒有理由的辭退。』</p>
<p>是恥辱，年青的孩子底心，給戳了一下，她開始懂得了藉自己的力量，生活在孤島的艱難。</p>
<p>記起臨別時，小朋友們親切的語聲：『老師！暑假過後再來吧。』接着，陸續授來了幾朵白蘭花，在臨別的頃刻，生活在白蘭花幽香的氣息里。這，充分地領略半年來孩子們給她的友愛。</p>
<p>如今呢？耳際常繚繞着孩子親切的語聲，惦念，不免時常從痛苦的心頭中不可抑止的漾起，孩子友情的溫暖哪！</p>
<p>想像着旁人的輕蔑（忘却了也會有人同情她，）自己也難為情在親戚家過日子，更不敢再去曾幫助她的老師身邊，告訴他：『我已失業了！』</p>
<p>編着很好的謊：『校中不答應住宿。』—於是在親戚家住下，一面却天天在街頭躑躅，餓了，進館子，費幾張角票，然而這種生活能繼續下去嗎？一張五元法幣，能够生活幾天呢？這一長串日子？渺茫</p>
<p>『歸去吧！』然而，孑然一身，兩袖清風……！家，又在鐵蹄的踐踏之下，年青人是不慣蟄居的。</p>
<p>怎好？這樣來回的在街頭躑躅　胸中，充溢着流浪者凄苦的意味。</p>
<p>繋着一千一百個結？胡可索解？？啊！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>風，淡淡的吹來，來往的人羣又都帶着了笑臉。於是望着天，但我這回沒有嘆氣，却更倔强地行進，永不想屈服。</p>
<h3>夜話</h3>
<p>— 沈毓剛</p>
<p>『許久以來我就想去做一個水手，到海上去尋找運氣。十年二十年後帶回一個黝黑的面孔給自己的鄉土』。</p>
<p>『那麼，你是大海的兒子了。』</p>
<p>『看守燈塔的職務也曾一度使我迷惘。但，一個如今晚一樣多星的夜裏，我忽然肯定那是老年人所做的事情：指示迷津。而像咱們這樣的年歲是應該去和海洋搏鬥的。你知道嗎？海水有着各種不同的顏色。我愛的是一股黑浪，衝擊着船身却吐出白色的沫子。是有大風潮的日子。活在船上才會懂得生命的意義。但，無需搬典故，說什麼泰山鴻毛。』</p>
<p>『你的一番話倒引起了我的興致。』</p>
<p>『是不是你也要皈依大海，做我的弟兄？』</p>
<p>『不，我是說引起我說話的興致。我倒喜歡做一個獵手。那份機警使我神往。』</p>
<p>『你是愛着一種神秘的東西了。』</p>
<p>『倒也未必。我祇是說我有過那麼一個想頭。帶一桿槍，一袋火藥，還有我最喜歡的鹿皮靴。懷着野心去建筑自己的運氣，動物的晦氣。』</p>
<p>『這可不公平。』</p>
<p>『你難道是人道主義者？哈哈。行獵最適宜的季節，不是晴朗的日子。我愛冬天雪後，漫山漫野白皚皚的一片。呵，但明天我要就道了，到山間去肩起槍。』</p>
<p>『是去獵隻鹿來做靴嗎』</p>
<p>『不，我到山間去獵狼。』</p>
<h3>耶穌降生與社會</h3>
<p>世界適在黑暗中，耶穌正是世界的真光，凡居住黑暗陰翳之人得見真光，就復甦起來。世界正是乾旱地，耶穌確比生命的甘霖，凡信受者，便得活命之水源，滋潤他的枯腸。世界在干戈驚擾風聲鶴唳之中，耶穌是平安的福音，此音入了憂傷之心，便得生命與平安，總之耶穌降世是上帝的大愛丕顯出來，供應一切人們心靈中正當的需要，這耶穌便是『上帝之愛的結晶』又是高貴無比的禮物，試看耶穌當時對於社會各方面的人所施與的，以及各方面之人對于耶穌之景從，便證以上之言的不錯。（一）（使勞苦者得安息）原野的牧人，是勞働階級的代表，他們在統治階級的手下，被榨去寶貴的汗血和光陰，而無安貧養老的保障，終身勞苦，永無出頭之日，正在嘆息失望的時候，偶然想起先知的預言，好像說『將來那日子一到，困苦之人，得着搭救，勞働之人，必得安舒』但是幾時可以看見呢？還是遙遙無期啊！不意在黑暗籠罩之夜，忽見天來奇光，於驚慌萬狀之中，聽見天使傳福音說：『不要懼怕，你們的救主今夜降生』！復聽耶穌的招呼說：凡勞苦負重担的人，可來就我以得安息，此種恩言，由於耶穌都成了生命之道了。（二）（使貧窮者得福音）請聽馬利亞之歌曰：我心尊主為至大，我靈奉主為至樂；衪顧念卑微之使女，萬代必稱我為有福，……萬能之主成了大事，願衪的名為至聖；衪憐憫敬畏他的人，以迄世世無窮。…衪施展偉大的能力，驅逐狂傲的人；衪使獨裁者失位，衪使卑微者升高，衪使富貴者空望，衪使饑餓者溫飽。（下略）耶穌要實現此種理想，必須自己先做貧窮的人，衪不生於高樓大廈，而生於馬房牛棚，狐貍有洞，飛鳥也有窩，而耶穌竟無枕首之所，衪原是極豐富的，却為我們成了貧窮，呌信者因衪的貧窮，能得到精神上的豐富，衪是一位使人富足的窮人，我們貧窮的人生，貧窮的社會，正缺乏福音，不平安，不和平，不仁愛，有恨怒，有貪心，有自私，為精神上的大貧，滔滔者天下皆是也，若是接受耶穌，就必因他的愛心與十字架，必定成為富有了。（如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號）</p>

<h3>卓別麟第六號　（Chaplin　No.6）　劇本審定內容秘密笑料歌舞特別豐富</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>笑匠卓別麟於完成巨片「大獨裁者」後，原擬退休不幹，誰料他興致勃勃，據好萊塢聯藝公司卓別麟事務所傳出來的消息，笑匠預備再拍一部諷刺希特勒的鉅片，定名爲「卓別麟第六號」（Chaplin　No.　6）。</p>
<p>這片子的劇本已經核定，內容則嚴守秘密，恐防一部份人遭受刺激。可得而聞的，其中角色有六個卓別麟，大家扮演獨裁者。卓別麟自身兼兩角，卽獨裁者和猶太剃頭匠，他曾把另一獨裁者的鬍子剃去。卓別麟的兄弟名呌薛尼的，扮演獨裁者的孿生兄弟，還有老搭擋三人。</p>
<p>除了六個卓別麟外，他一度愛過的高黛德女士，如「摩登時代」裏一樣，充一個窮苦的浣衣婦。又有陶尼爾君，扮演希特勒的股肱戈林上將，人材濟濟，劇情從無如此之盛。卓別麟在劇中，又發明了破靴黨式特別敬禮和新鮮舞蹈歌唱。</p>
<p>問題是在銷路方面，因爲自歐戰以來，美國片子在英法波各國出路大减，只有在別國設法，卓別麟的片子，以前在俄國是極受歡迎的，但蘇聯近和德國握手之後，對於笑匠諷刺德國元首的片子，是否禁映，亦是問題。</p>
<p>關於這一點，卓別麟曾挺身辯白，略謂國際局勢千變萬化，等我這片拍成之後，蘇聯早不與德國爲伍，敝人的作品決無何等阻碍，可以預言的。</p>
<h3>米高梅將攝「中國水滸」</h3>
<p>— 冶</p>
<p>中國，巳成爲好萊塢製片家心止中搜集劇料最好的處所，近年以來，以中國爲題材或背景的電影，就有好幾部，去年一度來華公映過的華納夏能主演的「上海血案在紐的開映時，就造成了空前的賣座紀錄，這當然引起米高　公司極大的注意，所以在他們二年餘的奔走國內外攝製的「大地」很快的宣告完成，雖然賣座並不如「上海血案」之如此鼎盛，但至少也能盈餘到百餘萬美金。現在米高梅公司主人業巳正式發表明春繼「大地」後將決定仍以賽珍珠小姐改譯的　中國水滸（All　men　are　Brothers）搬上銀慕，預備攝製費用爲四百萬美金，至於外景問題，因鑒於中國目前處於特殊環境之下，故決定不再來華攝製。</p>
<p>至於「中國水滸」裏需要的一百零八將，米高梅公司認爲決不能我到這許多男明星來擔任，而且人多了反而將使劇情减步興趣，故現在巳決定最多不超過三十五人，而目前又因爲原譯人賽珍珠小姐尚在倫敦養疴，並已拒絕帮助攝製，所以米高梅就預備在紐約聘請中國著名敎授來擔任「中國水滸的特的指導，現在正在設法聘請中，同時米高梅還預備向中國政府請求派員到好萊塢擔任顧問和參觀。</p>
<p>該劇導演巳選定茀德利曼飽琪擔任，主演人員亦已暫定爲保羅茂尼，華雷斯皮萊，威廉威爾孟，斯土拉維基，魯易那，娜威斯多得，克洛薄克爾等數十人，華籍演員則有留美戲劇家朱君和「大地」中的楊珠小姐。</p>
<p>我們希望米高梅公司以數百萬美金來攝製這中國民族英雄偉大精神的影片，至少應當不違背中國人民的意旨，什麼裏着金蓮足和拖着辮子的中國人等的歪曲現象，絕對不能在「中國水滸」一片中發現。</p>
<h3>「中旅」重振旗鼓　第一個戲演「復活」</h3>
<p>最近「中旅」和璇宮簽訂合同之後，唐槐秋一面寫信到香港去招集舊部歸隊，如葛鑫，李景波等，現在都已到了上海；一面挽友商請上海的話劇，電影演員加入客串，如劉瓊，嚴斐，屠光啟，丁芝兩對夫婦都答應加入「中旅」的特的陣容。</p>
<p>第一個和觀衆相見的戲是「復活」，不過這是應上海難民協會之請的慈善戲，廿四日起公演五天。至於正式公演，定於本年除夕，劇目爲魏如晦的西「太后」。</p>

<h3>漫談「俏寃家」</h3>
<p>— 玨</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白的演技，在「一夜風流」，顯現出極度的神妙，跟着在「第八夫人」中，尤有極佳妙的演出，充分顯出她的喜劇天才，是有不可限量的前程。米高梅公司的導演鉅子范達克第二，那裏肯放鬆這類型的天才，特地商聘她來主演「俏寃家」，在一九三九年喜劇影片中，獨樹一幟的產生了新作風。</p>
<p>全片以巧妙的笑料連鎖着，從郊外遇艷起，一直到水落石出止，每一刻進展，每一段演出，充滿幽默的言語與滑稽的動作。尤其是女的追求不停，到東到西的跟隨着，男的拚命逃避，不情願做桃色的俘虜。克爾白狀繪熱情的女詩人，一舉一動，使人笑逐顏開，忍俊不禁。史都華的私家大偵探，表現一副戇相，尤有出神入化之妙，沒有一刻冷靜，也沒有一刻遲緩，全片是在高速度的笑料中邁進。</p>
<p>最滑稽不過的是史都華前有追兵，後無去路的當口，戴起一副高深的近視眼鏡，扮做童子軍敎練，一步一蹶，宛如盲人騎了瞎馬，到處亂撞，虧着考爾白扶持，逃出了重圍，這一種表演，眞是滑犬下之大稽，誰也要笑痛了肚皮。</p>

<p>Xi'an: Since the 13th, over 2,000 Japanese troops, with over ten artillery pieces, invading from Wenxi, Xiaxian, An Yi, and southern Yuncheng have attacked areas such as Humiao, Xinliyuan, Jing'ergou, Shangxia Chenzhuang, and Junjialing. They were once captured by the Japanese, but after a desperate counterattack by a certain Chinese unit, five days and nights of bloody fighting resulted in over 400 Japanese deaths and the capture of many military supplies. The Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and retreated in disarray in a northwest direction. By the morning of the 17th, all the strongholds had been completely recaptured. Currently, various Chinese units are continuing to pursue the enemy towards Xiaolucun, Zhangbudian, Wangyukou and other places. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Improves Ramie Textiles</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Ramie spinning and weaving was originally a famous product of Sichuan Province, known throughout the world for its excellent quality. It is durable and comfortable to wear in summer. However, it is only woven into several types of ordinary ramie cloth, which has prevented it from occupying an important position in the international market. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has dispatched Dr. Yu Xizhang, an expert in ramie textiles, to Jiangjin, Qijiang, and other places to conduct on-site investigations. Furthermore, it is planning for relevant organizations such as the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Products Promotion Association, and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute to provide incentives for ramie cultivation and make large investments to promote its development. In the future, ramie textiles on the market, such as ramie bags and ramie cloth, will not only be self-sufficient, but can also be exported in large quantities. (20th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Opening of the Yangtze River and the Adjustment of Japanese-American Relations</h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese army's reopening of the lower Yangtze River traffic, the Japanese government issued an announcement yesterday. And formally notified the relevant countries in Europe and the United States. It indicates that it is prepared to lift the Yangtze River navigation ban below Nanjing, retaining the necessary restrictions to maintain public order and combat; when the preparation work can be completed, and what the so-called restrictions will be, of course, cannot be speculated before Japan has announced it. The Yangtze River navigation issue is the biggest dispute between Japan and the European and American countries after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The relevant countries have lodged many protests to Japan, but they have not been resolved satisfactorily! Now she suddenly announced that she is going to prepare to open the lower Yangtze River traffic, which has its own great intentions. However, since the release of this news, it has not caused a major reaction in countries such as Britain and the United States; that is, overseas Chinese businessmen in various countries, in addition to feeling skeptical, do not express pleasure. It can be seen that Japan's real intention is not difficult to be thoroughly understood by international people.</p>
<p>Japanese public opinion generally believes that the Japanese government's move is a huge sacrifice. For example, the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun strongly opposed it last week, saying that the opening of the Yangtze River will make all kinds of efforts made by Japan since the Sino-Japanese War come to naught. It also wrote yesterday that if this proposal still cannot ease relations with third countries, Nomura should resign to thank the people of the country; it shows that they attach great importance to the impact of this matter on Japan. Since invading the Yangtze River basin, Japan has organized various industrial and commercial societies in an attempt to monopolize the Yangtze River shipping industry, monopolize Yangtze River trade, so as to plunder all economic resources in the region; but the facts cannot make her wish come true; how can Japan's military power be allocated to such a large Yangtze River region; even the several large cities along the Yangtze River occupied by Japan, various industries and commerce have never returned to normal activities. Japan's so-called revitalization plan cannot be realized due to lack of funds and military conditions. Therefore, Japan's blockade of the Yangtze River traffic has not obtained the huge benefits it expected; even if Japan does not block it, it may not be possible for third countries to engage in normal trade. Japan claims how significant its sacrifices are in this announcement to prepare to restore traffic in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which is an exaggeration; its real intention is nothing more than to take this opportunity to obtain a larger exchange price. If third countries cannot satisfy her desires, the subsequent opening may be far away; even if Japan can obtain a considerable price and implement the opening, it must be no different from the Pearl River navigation. To achieve free navigation and trade, it fundamentally depends on Japan abandoning aggression or the complete failure of aggression.</p>
<p>According to Japanese official opinion, this announcement to prepare to open the lower Yangtze River seems to be entirely to adjust diplomatic relations with the United States, so as to continue to obtain arms supplies and avoid the United States taking economic retaliation policies, so she has to find a way to make friends with the United States and hope to conclude a new commercial treaty. But based on factual observations, the relationship is not only with the United States, so this is also Japan's way to adjust the entire diplomacy. Originally, in the past China's shipping industry, the power of Britain was the greatest: if the Yangtze River navigation is restored, it should be the most beneficial to Britain. This very clearly shows that Japan's purpose is also to contact Britain and France and want to obtain a considerable price from Britain and France. Not long ago, the Japanese ship Sanyou Maru returned home fully loaded with German goods from the British blockade, as well as the recent progress in the British-Japanese Tianjin negotiations. There is no trace of a spider's web to be found here. In addition, she can also use this to show that Japan's relationship with countries such as Britain and the United States is gradually improving; she can also use this posture to force the Soviet Union to improve its attitude towards Japan, which is another side effect.</p>
<p>Even in terms of Japan's attempt to ease Japanese-American relations, it can be seen that her superficiality is boring: among the repeated protests of the United States against Japan, it has already clearly pointed out that Japan has undermined the Nine-Power Treaty, then how can simply lifting the navigation ban on a short section of the lower Yangtze River represent the opening of China's door? From a utilitarian point of view, before the Sino-Japanese War, American ships entering and leaving Chinese ports accounted for only 2%; and almost no American commercial ships sailed on the Yangtze River. Therefore, opening the lower Yangtze River can be said to have absolutely nothing to do with the United States in terms of the shipping industry itself. In terms of commercial rights: What trade can be conducted in only a section of the Yangtze River waterway below Nanjing! None of the important products on the Yangtze River Delta is under Japan's exclusive control and sales; if items such as wharf equipment and inland transportation are not intended to be used by third countries, what is the difference between this and the ports in North China that have never been blocked; then what is the so-called opening? This is a huge question. How can foreign merchants have the freedom of shipping trade in the Pearl River, which has been open for a long time in practice! What benefits will the United States gain from opening traffic in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in this state?</p>
<p>However, Japan's hope of preparing to open the lower Yangtze River is too extravagant: she even hopes that the United States will continue to sign the US-Japan commercial treaty because of this move by Japan, and correct the American people's interpretation of the "New Order in East Asia"; not only is she demanding that the United States unconditionally continue to supply her with war materials to invade China, but also wants the United States to recognize her lifting of the Yangtze River navigation ban as a legitimate action, indirectly acknowledging her so-called "New Order in China." This kind of lifting of the navigation ban, which is almost a counter-demand, will only cause the United States to continue to lose greater rights and interests in China, and it is tantamount to making the United States sign and acknowledge and abandon major rights and interests forever. Such a superficial and boring attempt. It is firmly believed that it is not acceptable to the American government and the public.</p>
<h3>Japanese-American Negotiations Will Be Conducted Simultaneously in the Two Capitals; Japanese Ambassador Horiuchi Will Meet with Hull; No Guarantee Yet Offered on the Opening of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Washington: After reviewing the contents of the third meeting between Nomura and Grew, the US State Department plans to issue new instructions to Ambassador Grew to continue negotiations. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horiuchi also plans to meet with Secretary of State Hull in Washington on the 20th or 21st to supplement the Nomura-Grew talks. Therefore, Japanese-American negotiations seem to be proceeding in both Tokyo and Washington. According to the observations of the general public here, since Japan intends to open a part of the Yangtze River, the biggest obstacle between the two countries can be removed. Within this year, the two sides can reach an understanding and the possibility of concluding a new US-Japan commercial treaty and resolving various problems is quite high. (19th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull answered questions from reporters at the press conference yesterday, saying that Japan only expressed its intention to open the Yangtze River, and did not offer concrete guarantees and methods. Hull also said that he had not yet completed the study of the report of US Ambassador to Japan Grew. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura reported to the cabinet yesterday on the situation of his meeting with US Ambassador Grew and the plan to open part of the Yangtze River. Political figures summarized the results of the US-Japan negotiations as follows: (1) Japan's preparation to open the Yangtze River and the Pearl River has clearly recognized the rights of third countries in China; (2) Japan hopes that the United States can at least agree to a temporary commercial treaty for the transitional period after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty; (3) Japan also recognizes the rights of Britain. Regarding the Tianjin and currency issues, concessions must be made; (4) Britain and the United States have already established contact with the "New Order," so the issue of Britain and the United States recognizing the new situation created by the Sino-Japanese War is not important. (20th Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It has been learned here that in addition to preparing for the conditional opening of the Yangtze River, the Japanese government also intends to abolish the ban on Pearl River navigation. According to the Japanese side, due to "military necessity," it blocked the Pearl River on December 17 last year, prohibiting navigation by third countries. It is now heard that the effective period of this ban will last until the end of this year. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: According to reliable news on the 19th, a high-ranking official of the State Department made an informal report to a representative of a powerful commercial organization operated by Americans in New York, saying that: (1) Even if the US-Japan commercial treaty expires on January 26, the State Department does not expect that US-Japan commercial relations will undergo major changes immediately;</p>
<p>(2) Because US-Japan negotiations are proceeding as they are now, the State Department does not intend to seek any measures that would hinder US-Japan trade, even if the old treaty expires, before a new treaty is established. (19th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office declared yesterday that Japan had notified the British government that Japan was prepared to open the Yangtze River, but did not mention the opening date and other details. The spokesman also said that he had not received notification of the content of the talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura this week. (20th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Democratic Times commented on the Japanese government's plan to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, saying, "This plan is only a superficial concession to the dissatisfaction of the United States. However, it is welcome that Japan has expressed its willingness to compromise. In short, this concession, though of a secondary nature, is sufficient to prove that the attitude of the Japanese military is no longer as tough as it used to be." (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Meets with the President of the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila - Dr. Wang Zhengting, former Chinese Ambassador to the United States and currently Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications here, met today with Philippine President Quezon. It is reported that the discussion centered on the Philippines' plan to reclaim foreign-owned retail businesses for domestic operation. According to Quezon, this plan will be implemented gradually, and will not significantly hinder the current status of foreign retailers. Furthermore, it is essential that the retail industry in the Philippines be placed in Filipino hands. It is reported that Chinese merchants currently control approximately 80% of the retail businesses in the Philippines. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Undersecretary of State Discusses U.S.-Cuba Relations</h3>
<p>Washington - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech on October 21, touching upon the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland. He stated, "Cuba and the Republic of the Philippines have sought independence from the United States for years, but have not yet achieved their wishes. Therefore, the relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union is far better than the relationship between the United States and Cuba and the Philippines." U.S. Secretary of State Welles attended a banquet of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce in New York last night and delivered a speech in response to Molotov, stating, "In my opinion, the relationship between the United States and Cuba is far better than the relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union. I believe no one will disagree with this statement. I also believe that when Molotov delivered his speech, the Soviet government was undoubtedly using all its power and in its own way, to guarantee freedom and independence for Finland. Molotov had no time to look elsewhere, and therefore does not know that the Cuban people and government are completely free and independent, no less so than any other country. This is a fact known to the world." He then touched upon the self-sinking of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," saying, "The republics of the Americas are eager to enjoy security, which is an indelible and extremely legitimate right. However, the various incidents that have occurred in recent days prove that the European belligerents disregard the rights demanded by the American countries. As you know, the governments of the Americas are currently exchanging views and will certainly decide quickly on various measures to ensure that interference with the legitimate rights of these countries does not happen again."

<h3>Professor Emerson of the United States Discusses Japan's Current Expansionist Policy. Japan Covets the Resources of Various Colonies in the South Seas. The Dutch East Indies Are in Danger of Being the First to Be Invaded.</h3>
<p>Washington - Professor Emerson of political science at Harvard University recently wrote a special article for the Foreign Policy Research Association, discussing in detail whether Japan has expansionist ambitions in the South Seas. He stated, "In terms of North Asia, the general feeling is that another war between the Soviet Union and Japan is inevitable. However, the Soviet Union not only has the preparation to defend its territory, but also the ability to do so. Furthermore, Siberia has a harsh climate and its resources are not easily developed, so Japan has no firm determination to seize it. The opposite is true of the various colonies in the South Seas. Their natural resources, such as rubber, tin, oil, sugar, and other items, have become the world's main raw materials. These raw materials can not only be used by Japan itself, but also the surplus can be sold in the world market to obtain the foreign exchange that Japan needs. Furthermore, the various colonies in the South Seas can also serve as a market for Japanese goods, and their vast undeveloped lands can not only be developed by Japan, but also be used for Japanese immigration. Therefore, in many ways, the South Seas are more beneficial to Japan than China itself. Not only can their products supplement Japan's deficiencies, but geographically they hold the key to communication between Europe and Asia, which can greatly increase Japan's position in the world. The first place that Japan will attack will be the Dutch East Indies, because from the Japanese perspective, most of the Dutch East Indies is undeveloped and sparsely populated, and cannot be developed solely by its own economic strength. Therefore, Japan believes that expansion into the South Seas is necessary for Japan." Emerson continued, "The Dutch East Indies, under Dutch control, is of great benefit to the British Empire. Its importance is the same as the independence of the Netherlands and the position of Britain in Europe. Although the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan has expired, if necessary, Germany and Japan will still cooperate remotely and support each other. Germany will attack the Netherlands, and Japan will attack the Dutch East Indies." Emerson then discussed the position of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands in the South Seas, stating: (1) Although Singapore is an ideal naval base, it is difficult to threaten Japan's main force without the support of capital ships and other vessels, and it is also difficult to prevent Japan's attack on the Dutch East Indies from eastern and northern Java, and it is difficult to prevent Japan's attack on Annam. (2) However, Britain's plan to strengthen Singapore's defenses with the assistance of Australia is being actively promoted. Factories, food, ammunition, and aircraft are all being produced in large quantities in Australia to strengthen Singapore's defenses. (3) The strengthening of the artillery emplacements at the port of Qui Nhon in Annam, and the addition of aircraft factories and armories, are all intended to strengthen Annam's defenses. (4) As for the Netherlands, it is also trying to expand in the East Indies, and does not waste resources on fluid defense plans, the purpose of which is to restrain the enemy, so that the enemy cannot launch a quick decision, so that Britain, France, or the United States can provide timely assistance. (5) The British and French Far East armies recently decided at a meeting in Singapore to fight side by side in the Far East. The naval and air bases of the two countries in the Far East can be mutually used. As for the United States, if Japan attacks the Philippines, the United States will regard it as a challenge to the United States. If Japan takes a more cunning approach, temporarily not attacking the Philippines but attacking other places, it is difficult to know what attitude the United States will take. However, if the United States is neutral, its neutrality will also be beneficial to Britain and France. Furthermore, if the U.S. Navy is stationed permanently in the Far East, Japan will have to be cautious in its future actions. Discussing the difficulties of Japan's southward expansion plan, Professor Emerson stated that although Japan's strategic position is now better than before, if Japan takes action in the South Seas, its lines of communication will be further extended, and occupying new territories will certainly not be easy. Secondly, war expenses will inevitably increase further. Thirdly, the troops stationed within China and on the Manchurian border must be transferred to China. Fourthly, Japan's fleet will inevitably be dispersed, and its home country will be in a less defended position. Fifthly, Japan's merchant fleet will inevitably disappear at sea. Therefore, Japan's major policy is a policy of gradual nibbling, rather than a whole devouring. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Alaska Requests Strengthened Defenses</h3>
<p>Washington - Representative Dimond of the Alaskan Peninsula (note: this representative has no voting rights) recently made a statement saying that Japan and the Soviet Union have probably concluded a treaty of alliance. The existing air bases in Sitka, Fairbanks, and Kodiak Island on the Alaskan Peninsula are not sufficient to protect the security of the peninsula. I will request that Congress pass a bill allocating $15 million to build another air base in Anchorage to strengthen defenses. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Stalin's Birthday</h3>
<p>Moscow - December 21 is Stalin's 60th birthday. The entire Soviet Union will hold grand celebrations. All newspapers will issue special editions, publishing articles about Stalin's lifelong revolutionary career and socialist construction work. Many famous scientists, artists, craftsmen, aviators, Stakhanovite workers, outstanding collective farmers, and veteran revolutionaries have written articles, many of which describe their contact with Stalin himself, and Stalin's encouragement and assistance to their work and life. Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and other major cities have opened exhibitions related to Stalin's life and work, including paintings, sculptures, literature, photography, and document files. Factories, workshops, schools, collective farms, and Red Army and Navy units will hold lectures on Stalin's life. On his birthday, celebrations will be held throughout the Soviet Union. At the same time, many new books about Stalin's life will be published. The first edition of "Stalin's 60th Birthday" by Kalinin will be released in one million copies. Films will be made about places related to Stalin's revolutionary work and will be released on that day. Workers, students, intellectuals, and others will organize many tour groups to visit Stalin's hometown, Gori Town in Georgia Province. The above-mentioned preparatory work for the celebrations is being actively participated in by the masses, and their emotions are all very enthusiastic. Therefore, Stalin's birthday has become a great celebration for the entire Soviet people, fully demonstrating the people's worship and love for their great leader and good friend. (TASS, 19th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Gold Production</h3>
<p>Manila - The Philippine gold mining industry began 30 years ago, but production was not significant. It was not until 7 years ago that active reorganization began, and the value of production exceeded 10 million pesos (Philippine currency). Since then, it has increased year by year, especially this year. Although the overall gold production report for November of this year has not yet been fully released, it is expected that the value of gold production in November will be 6.4 million pesos. Based on the production volume for the 11 months of this year, it has reached 66 million pesos. It is expected that the total production value for 1939 will be between 73 million and 74 million pesos, an increase of about 9 million or 10 million pesos compared to last year's figures. According to newspaper forecasts, the gold mining industry has been very developed in recent years and will soon take the first place in the Philippine economy, which is currently held by the sugar industry. The annual output of the Philippine sugar industry is worth about 100 million pesos. Last year, there were 30 companies engaged in gold mining, and this year the number has increased to 40. The following is a list of Philippine gold production in recent ten years:</p>

<h3>Unable to Break Through the Blockade, German Giant Mail Ship Sinks Itself. The Columbus Has a Displacement of 32,000 Tons. All 500 Crew Members Were Rescued by U.S. Warships.</h3>
<p>Washington - The German mail ship "Columbus," with a displacement of 32,565 tons, sailed from Veracruz, Mexico, on the 13th of this month, carrying 20,000 barrels of crude oil, attempting to break through the naval blockade of Britain and France. However, it was still pursued by a British warship. In order to avoid being captured, the German ship scuttled itself at 10:00 PM GMT tonight in the ocean 300 miles northeast of Cape Henry, Virginia. This is the twenty-second time a German ship has scuttled itself. At that time, the U.S. cruiser "Tuscaloosa" happened to be patrolling nearby and immediately rescued the German crew. Generally speaking, the British warship began to intercept the "Columbus" after sailing out of the "neutral zone" of the American continent. This is the first time Britain has de facto recognized the existence of the neutral zone, and the White House is quite satisfied. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced today that the German mail ship "Columbus" (32,000 tons) was spotted by a British warship about 400 miles north of Bermuda and immediately set itself on fire. The crew members all left the ship and left it to burn. The ship is the largest mail ship owned by the North German Lloyd and joined the route in 1922, traveling back and forth across the Atlantic. According to news from Washington, all crew members have been rescued. The U.S. cruiser "Tuscaloosa" was nearby. According to the ship's report, a total of 579 German crew members escaped, of which about 400 were rescued by the U.S. ship and sent to New York. The New York immigration authorities announced today that if the investigating committee confirms that all the escaped crew members are genuine sailors, they will be allowed to stay in the United States for 60 days and will be treated the same as sailors from any other country. If any crew members are found to be naval personnel or spies, they will be detained and dealt with separately. It is reported that the "Columbus" is still floating on the sea, and the fire has not been extinguished. The U.S. Navy has broadcast a warning, urging all ships to pay attention, saying that the German ship and its 22 lifeboats are now floating on the sea and are all dangerous to navigation. The position of the German ship is said to be 500 miles southwest by west of New York. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - After the German transatlantic mail ship "Columbus" scuttled itself, the number of German ships that have scuttled themselves to avoid capture has reached 23, with a total tonnage of approximately 140,000 tons. As for the German ships captured by the Allied countries, there are a total of 19, with 88,000 tons. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>New York - The "New York Times" received a telegram from Hamilton, Bermuda, today, saying that the interception of the German mail ship "Columbus" was due to the proper handling of the commander of the West Indies Naval Station, who, after receiving news of the ship, immediately ordered a destroyer to be dispatched and gave detailed instructions on the route to follow. As a result, the German ship was eventually intercepted. The ship scuttled itself after seeing that capture could not be avoided. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Mexico City - Regarding the sinking of the mail ship "Columbus," well-informed sources here recently announced that the ship had been hiding in Veracruz, Mexico, for almost two months. The crew members took the opportunity to load goods and food, and slaughtered and froze fresh fish and livestock for long-term food. In the two weeks before departure, two trucks loaded with food were transported from Mexico City to Veracruz every day. Part of the cargo price, 25,000 pesos, was supplied by German expatriates. Many non-German crew members, including Chinese and Spanish, gradually withdrew hundreds of days before the start because they did not want to share the fate of the German ship. Until the 13th of this month, the shipowner ordered the anchor to be raised, attempting to break through the British and French naval blockade and sail to Trieste, Italy. It was eventually intercepted by a British warship and scuttled itself. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Captain of the Admiral Graf Spee Commits Suicide for His Country. His Will Still Cherishes His Comrades, Saying That He Had Long Resolved to Die with the Ship.</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires - Captain Langsdorff of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" committed suicide with a pistol in his bedroom at the "Immigration Hotel" today. He was found lifeless. Langsdorff also had a will, which stated that he had long resolved to die with his ship, but wanted to find a safe place for his thousands of comrades, so he deliberately delayed his life. When Captain Langsdorff arrived here on Sunday, a reporter from the U.S. Associated Press interviewed him. According to Langsdorff, "I am satisfied. I have saved all my comrades to a safe place. I have nothing else to say. I am old and have not had a moment of peace since last night. Please forgive me, I won't talk too much." The general opinion here is that Langsdorff scuttled his ship on the orders of Berlin, which drew severe criticism from the British and French newspapers, so he regretted it and committed suicide. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires - The Argentine government will pay 100,000 pesos (equivalent to £6,000) per month to the German pocket battleship "Spee" crew members who are being detained. All detention expenses will be settled with the German government. The ship's officers will be released after swearing an oath and will remain in Buenos Aires. The soldiers on the ship will be detained in the countryside, but will be allowed to enjoy certain freedoms. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - According to New York radio, Captain Langsdorff of the German pocket battleship "Spee," which was scuttled outside the port of Montevideo, said to guests that the German ship had repeatedly changed its name during its attacks on British ships, so it was considered "the German battleship 'Deutschland' or 'Admiral Scheer', giving people the impression that three German pocket battleships were engaged in attacks in the same area."

<h3>British Sea, Land, and Air. British and German Air Battles. 51 Times in Two Months. 21 German Aircraft Destroyed.</h3>
<p>London - Officials here announced that nearly half of the German bombers and reconnaissance aircraft that engaged British aircraft in the first two months of the war were shot down. In the two months of October and November, 51 battles occurred in the British sea, land, and air, resulting in the destruction of 21 German aircraft. Of these, 13 were witnessed falling on land or in the sea. In addition, many enemy aircraft did not return to Germany. Since the start of the war, no British fighter aircraft has been shot down within the country. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - Several German aircraft flew over the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland today. Many British fighter aircraft immediately took off to meet them. The German aircraft fled into the clouds before engaging. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>France's Huge Military Budget for Next Year Reaches 250 Billion Francs</h3>
<p>Paris - Finance Minister Reynaud recently submitted the wartime budget for the first quarter of 1940 to the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies for review. The total amount reached 55,034,000,000 francs, of which military expenditures for the three departments of the navy, army, and air force and the Department of Munitions accounted for 53,222,000,000 francs. Finance Minister Reynaud also explained that the development of the war is difficult to predict, so it is not easy to determine in advance how much the total amount of defense expenditures will be. This is why the wartime budget is set for a period of three months. As for the entire wartime budget for 1940, it is estimated that it will reach as much as 255 billion francs, of which military expenditures for the three departments of the navy, army, and air force and the Department of Munitions will account for more than 245 billion francs. In addition to regular income, the shortfall in all expenditures will be financed by raising bonds. In order to express the determination of the French nation to win, it is hoped that the Chamber of Deputies will quickly pass the budget. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Flies Over France, Gifts Chamberlain with an Umbrella.</h3>
<p>Berlin - The British Broadcasting Corporation announced a few days ago that Prime Minister Chamberlain flew to France on the 14th of this month to inspect the British army there, and added that Chamberlain did not bring an umbrella on this trip. After hearing this report, German air force personnel, fearing that Chamberlain would be invaded by wind and rain, decided to give him an umbrella. On the 17th of this month, they flew to northern France and dropped an umbrella near the expected location of Chamberlain's entourage. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Paris - The Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France discussed the issue of how to effectively provide material assistance to Finland. The most important thing they focused on was what the British and French governments would do if Norway and Sweden were drawn into the vortex of war. In short, the Soviet Union is no longer a neutral country and has been declared out of the League of Nations by the League of Nations. The international situation has changed greatly as a result. How Britain and France will stand in the future has been determined by this Joint Defense Council meeting. This meeting not only decided to strengthen cooperation on diplomatic and military issues in principle, but also drafted a method of cooperation, but responsible people are unwilling to disclose its contents. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Although the British and French authorities have not yet formally expressed anything about aiding Finland, it is heard that the two countries intend to supply Finland with machine guns, field artillery, aircraft, gas masks, chemicals for making explosives, trucks, and food as much as possible.

It is hoped that assistance to Finland can be stepped up in the future. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>New York - The Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France, held in Paris yesterday, has decided to provide material assistance to Finland.

Britain and France are now increasingly assisting Finland, while Germany is increasingly leaning towards the Soviet Union. Whether the two wars in Europe will merge into one is a major issue at the moment." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Returns Home from France, Praising the Spirit of the Expeditionary Force.</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain went to France for inspection and returned to England at night, delivering a radio address and praising the British Expeditionary Force. It is said that everything I saw in the British Army and Air Force moved me. The British army has been in France for a short time, and there are difficulties such as weather conditions, but its progress has surprised me. The commander-in-chief's plans for defense are well-prepared, and the spirit of his troops is commendable. I am also pleased to hear that there is a very good relationship between the British Expeditionary Force and the French people. I have complete confidence in the ability of the British Expeditionary Force to undertake any task. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>Rumor of Soviet Battleship "October Revolution" Sunk by Finnish Fortifications; Definite Assertions, but Verification Remains Difficult</h3>
<p>Helsinki – The Soviet battleship "October Revolution" (displacement 23,370 tons) is rumored to have been sunk by Finnish fortifications. Although this has not been officially confirmed, informed sources here claim that the Soviet naval authorities were aware that Finnish fortifications had artillery emplacements with a range of only five kilometers. Therefore, their warships usually anchored beyond that range. However, they were unaware that the Finns had secretly installed large-caliber guns with a range of up to six kilometers. Therefore, it is quite possible that the Soviet warship was sunk. The "October Revolution" was built in 1911 and completely modernized in 1926. It belongs to the same class as the other three Soviet battleships, "Poltava," "Petropavlovsk," and "Sevastopol," and is equipped with twelve 12-inch guns, making it one of the most important warships in the Soviet fleet. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London – According to a dispatch from the "Exchange Telegraph" correspondent in Helsinki last night, the Soviet battleship "October Revolution" has sunk near Bjorko. Although there is no official confirmation, some of the ship's crew landed in Bjorko in lifeboats, so the news of the ship's sinking is probably accurate. The ship was passing by Bjorko without any intention of fighting, but the Finnish forces opened fire when they saw it enter their firing range. The ship was severely damaged and sank as a result. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The rumor that the Soviet battlecruiser "October Revolution" has been sunk by Finnish fortifications is currently unconfirmed. It is only known that since the start of the war, this warship or a cruiser of the same class has repeatedly shelled the Finnish coast. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>German Police Chief Suddenly Visits Rome, Entrusted with Important Mission</h3>
<p>Rome – Heinrich Himmler, head of the German political police, arrived here this morning. It is rumored that he is on an important mission and will be meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Political circles here are paying close attention. It is said that Himmler came to Milan several weeks ago for talks with the authorities. At that time, it was widely rumored that the three issues discussed were: (1) the repatriation of Germans from the Italian Tyrol province to Germany; (2) the number of Austrians who fled to Italy since the outbreak of the war; and (3) the selection of a date for a meeting between Prime Minister Mussolini and Führer Hitler. Himmler's current visit may be a continuation of discussions with the Italian authorities on these issues. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

This cooperation is not only limited to dealing with the current war, but also a mission to establish future peace. We should go together to implement it. As for how the future political system of our country will be, it will be determined by ourselves." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Britain Spends Christmas in Atmosphere of War; People Scatter and Reunite; Railway Bureau Opens Special Trains</h3>
<p>London – Britain is now preparing to spend its first Christmas in wartime in 21 years in a solemn but not pessimistic atmosphere. Thousands of families who have been separated due to evacuation or national service are planning a temporary reunion. The railways have therefore prepared special trains, but the Railway Bureau asks the public to travel during the day as much as possible during the holidays, as railway personnel are restricted by blackout regulations.

<h3>Two Major British Politicians Advocate Aiding China; British Far East Policy Not Expected to Change; Soviet Feelings Towards China Should Not Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News today published an article detailing the conversations between Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, and former British Prime Minister Lloyd George during Sun's visit to London. It is said that Sun heard Churchill's broadcast in London and felt that his views were similar to those expressed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The next day, he went to see Churchill and told him of his feelings. Churchill replied that Britain's war against Germany and China's war of resistance against Japan had the same purpose, which was to resist aggression. Churchill and Lloyd George both criticized the British government's policies in recent years, believing that the current European situation was the result of appeasement policies. Both major politicians advocated aiding China. General public opinion in Britain believes that there will be no changes in British Far East policy. European newspapers pay close attention to news from the Soviet Union. Not only do they disclose more, but they also print it in the most prominent positions. The Soviet Union's interest in and sympathy for China should not be ignored. Sun Ke also told the Central Daily News that Britain is now adopting a long-term war strategy, and its goals and slogans are very similar to those that China has been advocating in its two years of war against Japan. In his opinion, the position of small and weak countries in Europe in the war is very difficult.

<h3>Random Notes on a Trip East (Second Letter)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>5.  Ji'an of Xiang-Zhe Bridge and Liang</p>
<p>Ji'an is located in the middle reaches of the Gan River, 216 kilometers north of Nanchang and 209 kilometers south of Ganxian. It has long been known as an important city in central Jiangxi. After the fall of Nanchang, Ji'an became the hub of Jiangxi's highway transportation and the Gan River waterway. Its importance is no less than that of Hengyang in Hunan. Those traveling between Zhejiang and Hunan provinces regard this place as a bridge on the southeast shortcut. Southwestern merchants consider this place as the main route to trade in the southeast. Although the military and political center of Jiangxi is not in Ji'an, it plays a significant role economically. Goods needed in northern Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangxi are distributed from here. The commercial center is located in the Yongsu Road area on the east bank of the Gan River. It has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, but it is rebuilt after each bombing and still maintains its modern urban style. It can still rival the major cities of various southwestern provinces. After 4 p.m., the stores open one after another, with 70-80% being department stores. Daily necessities from Ningbo and Wenzhou ports are transported here in various colors and in large quantities. Prices are about 20-30% lower than in other southwestern regions. Leather products are even only half the price of Guilin (Ji'an produces cowhide, and finished yellow and black leather sells for 45-50 cents per square foot, while in Guilin, it costs at least one yuan, and in Sichuan and Guizhou, it costs even more). Gasoline costs more than 30 yuan per bottle (more than 40 yuan in Hengyang and more than 50 yuan in Guilin). Most of the goods in the stores have not been evacuated. The city streets are expanding, but fire lanes have not yet been opened. If Japanese aircraft come again to wreak havoc, the losses will be huge. The Jiangxi authorities should strengthen evacuation, and Ji'an merchants should also plan ahead for their own sake.</p>
<p>Ji'an has three large-scale newspapers (Jiangxi): Minguo Daily, Mingchi Daily, and Qianfang Daily, and three small-scale newspapers: Jiebao, Dazhong Daily, and Kangzhan Daily. All are printed on local paper. Minguo Daily is run by the Jiangxi Provincial Government and has a wider circulation. Mingchi Daily is the second, and Qianfang Daily is the worst. Among the small newspapers, Jiebao has a better format and content. Its rival seems to be Dazhong Daily. In general, small newspapers seem to be more lively than large newspapers and have a tendency to seek progress. With the current population of Ji'an, three or two newspapers are enough to supply the needs. It seems unnecessary for six newspapers to be published in one place. (Later, the reporter traveled to various places in central and eastern Jiangxi, and only Xingguo had "Dajia's Newspaper" (octavo), and Ningdu had Lianhe Daily. (Large newspapers do not have news receiving equipment and reprint news from Ji'an newspapers every day. Qianxian Daily in Shangrao has a wide circulation in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces and will not be discussed.) If they can be distributed to various places, the newspapers can exert greater power than they do now.</p>
<p>6. Visiting Xiong Shihui</p>
<p>On the morning of November 20, I took a bus from Ji'an to ×× to visit Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. I was granted an audience. According to the conversation, "Jiangxi Province has a total of 83 counties, of which Pengze, Hukou, Jiujiang, Ruichang, Xingzi, Zongan, Wuning, Yongxiu, Anyi, Jing'an, Fengxin, Nanchang, and 13 other counties have been occupied. However, county administration has not been abolished, and the people's armed forces are still developing and growing. There are currently tens of thousands of self-defense forces, assisting guerrillas and advancing teams in the occupied areas. In terms of finance, the annual income before the war was about 40 million yuan, and now it is only 30 million yuan. We are striving to reduce expenditures, and the income and expenditure are still sufficient. Education expenses account for one-fifteenth of the total expenditure, with an annual fee of 2 million yuan. Because Jiangxi Province does not yet have institutions of higher learning, we are planning to establish Zhongzheng University in a certain place in southern Jiangxi, with an estimated annual expenditure of 400,000 yuan, with departments of liberal arts, law, agriculture, and engineering. It is expected to open in the spring of next year. In terms of transportation, only the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway remains in the province. Highway transportation is being maintained with great effort amidst busy military transportation. Currently, there are scheduled buses running daily on the Gan-Xiang, Ji-(An)-Gan (Xian), Ji-Ning (Du), Gan-Ying (Tan), and Gan-Min lines, for renting and travel. The Construction Department has also established a wartime trade department, equipped with ×× trucks for transporting goods, regularly exporting local products such as rice and tea, and importing daily necessities for merchants. Commodity regulation is still active. There are currently 60,000 refugees in the province, who are being relieved by the provincial government and engaged in farming and handicrafts in various counties in southern Jiangxi. Their lives are gradually being resolved. Timber is a major export product of Jiangxi Province. Taking Suichuan County as an example, it used to reach 2 million yuan per year. Now, due to the impact of the war, it has not been exported for nine years, and the losses are considerable. However, the forest has gained this considerable time of 'protection,' and what has been lost in the past can be regained in the future.'"</p>
<p>7. The Winding Line of Ningdu</p>
<p>From Ji'an to eastern Zhejiang, one could originally take a highway through Linchuan to Dongxiang, connecting with the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. This summer, because the Japanese army in Nanchang attempted to advance southward, the railway was deliberately destroyed, and it was rerouted south from Ji'an, passing through Taihe and Xingguo, winding through Ningdu, and heading north through Guangchang, Nanfeng, Nancheng, and Jinxi to reach the Yingtan Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, twice the distance of the original route. On the morning of November 24, I took a ×× bus from Ji'an to Ningdu. At around 9 a.m., we passed Taihe, the east bank of the Gan River, and reached Xingguo County via Guanchao, Huilong Temple, and Laoyingpan (132 kilometers). A section of the roadbed is lower than the surrounding fields, causing flooding in this rainy season, and the road surface is easily damaged. There are road construction workers and piles of bricks, stones, and yellow soil along the way. Because of the lack of guidance, they only cut the decaying grass on the roadside and ignore the ruts on the road surface. The car can only travel at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour. The loss of cars, gasoline, and time is great. The valley of Laoyingpan is dozens of miles long. The car revolves in it, and the beautiful scenery of maple, bamboo, pine, and fir trees assaults the senses. There is often the feeling of "doubting there is no road ahead when the mountains and rivers are exhausted, but finding a new village with bright flowers and willows." The villages are mostly dilapidated, and even the residents are very poor. Although it is a paradise, it does not seem to be a blessed place on earth.</p>
<p>Xingguo is a small town in the hills, with the unique cleanliness of various counties in Jiangxi. The No. × Rehabilitation Hospital of the Ministry of Military Affairs is located here, with more than 2,000 war-wounded soldiers. Under the leadership of the county magistrate, they are divided into groups to form cooperatives for leather making, printing, sock making, gauze, straw shoes, and tailoring. The wounded and disabled soldiers are all dressed in blue cloth, with the name of the group and the red and white cloth characters of the number attached. The reporter met a soldier from Henan who had participated in the Battle of Shanghai. He was missing a finger and is now a leather worker, receiving the salary of a first-class soldier. According to him, the food here is cheaper and life is peaceful, but he regrets not being able to continue killing ×. They get along with the residents like family members and are also respectful to the leather making teacher (originally a leather worker), treating him with the etiquette of a disciple.</p>
<p>From Xingguo to Ningdu, it is 106 kilometers, of which 50 kilometers from Jiangbeidong and Guanyin'ao to Yinkeng is a newly opened road line. The Pan Road project on Guanyin'ao Mountain, which is hundreds of feet high, has not yet been completed. Hundreds of workers are continuing to open mountains and fill valleys. After Yinkeng, it turns into the main road between Ganxian and ×Tan, arriving in Ningdu at about 5 p.m. (238 kilometers between Ji'an and Ningdu, the bus fare is 13.1 yuan). Ningdu is adjacent to Ruijin and was the center of the red area in the past. The population has decreased sharply after the war, and the damage to houses is not very great. Because it is located in the transportation hub of inland Jiangxi Province, the Commissioner's Office of the ×th District is located here. There are many new houses being built, but most of the merchants are not natives.</p>
<p>8. The Tale of Nanfeng Oranges</p>
<p>The 224 kilometers between Ningdu and Yingtan, only the roadbed of the new line between Nancheng and Yingtan is not solid. The road is muddy on rainy days, and the vehicles were in danger three times, but the entire journey was completed in one day.</p>
<p>Guangchang was the site of a battle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. On the walls of the villages, slogans such as "Commemorate May 1st • Seize the Central City," "Education • Nurturing • Health," and "The War of Resistance Will Surely Win, and National Construction Will Surely Succeed" can still be seen, which are enough to represent the three major stages of China in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Lunch was in Nanfeng. Near the bus station, orange vendors lined up in the market. You can buy 13 kilograms for one yuan. Nanfeng oranges are small, have few seeds, thin skin, and sweet taste. They are a famous product of Jiangxi. The orange sellers said that most farmers in Nanfeng grow oranges, and the best ones are from Guo Bei Garden. The best varieties come from the areas of Shuinan, Yaopu, and Shishan. The rest are inferior. Eight orange trees are planted per mu (the remaining space can still be used to grow vegetables, etc.). They bear fruit after five years, but the fruits from trees aged ten to twenty-five years are the best. Trees aged thirty to forty years are mostly decayed and do not produce good fruit. Harvesting can begin after the beginning of winter each year, and late-maturing varieties can be harvested until January of the following year. The county produces about 70,000 kilograms annually, but there are good and bad harvests. Last year, only 70% was harvested, while this year there was a full harvest. Next year, there will be another poor harvest. The main market is Nanchang. Fruit merchants from Nanchang come here every year to purchase and manipulate the market price, and the farmers can do nothing about it. This year, because there is less exploitation by middlemen, the price is higher. Although the sales are smaller, the farmers can make a profit. It costs 10 yuan to transport Nanfeng oranges to Yingtan and 20 yuan to Ganxian per dan.</p>
<p>Yingtan is the terminal for passenger and freight transport on the western end of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It is a small town in Guixi County. It has met the right time and the market is booming, making it almost unrecognizable to those who passed by here half a year ago. The town is widening streets, and new houses are being built near the railway station and bus station. Before the houses are completed, they are snatched up for rent, mostly by transportation companies, numbering no less than a hundred. The rest are hotels, newspapers, and restaurants.

<h3>High Rice Prices in Dinghai Due to Japanese Military Control</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: The rice produced in this county every year is not enough for the residents of the entire county for half a year. Since the fall of the county seat, the transportation between Ningbo and Dinghai has been cut off, and the supply of food from outside is scarce. Moreover, due to the strong control imposed by the Japanese side and the manipulation and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants, rice prices have continued to rise. White glutinous rice costs 23.5 yuan per dan, creating an unprecedented record in the county. Sweet potato shreds, a staple food, have also skyrocketed in price due to controlled transportation and sales, making it difficult for civilians to make a living, and complaints are rife. Furthermore, the Shenjiamen Town in the county was previously short of food and had returned to Shanghai to purchase 450 shi of poor-quality rice loaded on the Japanese ship Huazhong Maru to be transported to Shenjiamen for relief. Unexpectedly, the ship sank due to overloading, and the batch of rice was completely buried in the belly of the fish. The food problem for the people is extremely serious. Recently, residents have been starving to death from time to time. The Dachentou Xieyuan Rice Store was suddenly surrounded and robbed by more than 20 poor people while it was transporting rice the other day. The situation was serious, beyond description.</p>

<h3>Couple's Knowledge: Only a Healthy Man Deserves to Talk About Love</h3>
<p>— Co-authored by American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei and Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, the intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(Time) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., closed on Sundays</p>
<p>Love is a flower in a healthy life. The healthier the body, the more beautiful the flower. "Only a healthy man deserves to talk about love"! This is a motto that every young man should keep in mind. It is like a weak and incompetent man talking about love, which is equal to asking for trouble! A man should be healthy, majestic, and full of energy, loved by women and loved by his wife and concubines. Why are they now weak and incompetent, and fall into the hell on earth! ? According to medical judgment: Most of them are caused by early romance, not knowing how to love themselves, having bad habits of masturbation, or homosexuality, or nocturnal emission without treatment, or early marriage and indulgence, or polygamy and licentiousness, or worrying and injuring, etc., which depleted the secretions in the gonads (ie semen) of the source of life. Therefore, all symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, headache and distension, tinnitus and dizziness, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, underdevelopment, kidney deficiency and lack of children, and premature aging are not enough. This kind of weak man is often outwardly strong and inwardly empty, or even has a yellow and thin face, and is depressed. Not only is it difficult to study and difficult to find a job, there is a danger of dropping out of school and unemployment; even between men and women, wanting to talk about love is often abandoned by women and fall into unrequited love! In the married life after marriage, it will be difficult for the wife to be satisfied and difficult to be happy forever. From this, the quarrels and quarrels between husband and wife, private communication and elopement, divorce and suicide and other tragedies are not also often heard? Or even because the above-mentioned symptoms are not treated, leading to a short-lived death, leaving behind orphans and widows, that is really tragic! Since love is a flower in a healthy life, it should be used to promote health. If licentiousness and indulgence are harmful to health, it must not be. However, if you accidentally suffer from one or all of the above-mentioned symptoms due to ignorance in the past, you should have a thorough cure as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to world-famous doctors and our many years of experience, the most effective treatment is to take a preparation of male and strong animal gonadal hormones, "Gonadotropin". Because this agent has the most precious quality and the most effective efficacy, it cannot be achieved by any similar agent. It can produce semen and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation within 24 hours after taking it. Continuous taking will further promote development, nourish nerves, and must cure all symptoms in a short period of time. Regular taking in winter and spring will prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emission should also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills" (all major pharmacies in China and the West sell them for 2 yuan per box. Be sure to identify the words Hemitots when purchasing) to consolidate the essence and stop nocturnal emission, then the effect will be quick!</p>
<p>The patient Sheng Zhiqiang, from Guangdong, is 28 years old and an importer and exporter. Due to early marriage and new injuries, he suffered from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. Sometimes he was even impotent and unable to lift, and his brain and kidney were severely damaged. He had taken various patent medicines on the market, but none of them worked, so his life was boring! Last month, he was introduced to our clinic for treatment by his friend. After detailed observation of his condition, he asked him to buy three dozen "Gonadotropins" and one dozen "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills" and take them at the same time, and used electrotherapy injections and other methods. After more than a month, all his diseases suddenly disappeared, his weight increased by five pounds, his energy was abundant, and the love between husband and wife was even better than after the wedding!</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>Your Breasts Control Your Destiny!</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Life is not arranged by fate, beauty is enough to boast, look at the women with big breasts and fat buttocks, most of them are rich ladies.</p>
<p>There is no need to deny that no matter how honest and honest a man is, if he sees a beautiful and touching woman, he will also stare at her, feeling an inexplicable love in his heart. The reason why beautiful women are so precious and worthy of people's love must be attributed to the pair of breasts in front of their chests, because a woman's breasts are like the spire on a glass tower. Without it, no matter how delicate and exquisite the tower body is, it always feels out of shape. A woman who does not have towering breasts undulating in front of her chest, even if she has the beauty of Xizi and Wang Qiang, will only be called a "morbid beauty", not valued by men of the times, and will not be blessed to be the mistress of a new family, let alone hope to be a rich lady. Therefore, young women in Europe and the United States now pay attention to the development of the breast part instead of wasting unnecessary cosmetic funds on beauty. They regard the breasts as a second life. If there is any atrophy, they will immediately use German "Female Gonadotropin" to save it. The main reason for breast atrophy is that the ovarian function is destroyed by leucorrhea, dysmenorrhea, masturbation, anemia, malnutrition, and weak multiparity, which affects the metabolism. Therefore, the most effective treatment is to take female "Gonadotropin", the ovarian preparation of male and strong animals, which is the most reliable. This agent has been proven by major Chinese and Western doctors to be peaceful in nature and great in efficacy. It can be taken regularly regardless of cold or heat. If it is continued to be taken around the winter solstice, it will be even more effective. It can not only make the atrophied breasts gradually towering, but also adjust menstruation, increase body temperature, strengthen metabolism, generate a large number of new cells, make the skin smooth, the complexion ruddy, and youth will last forever.</p>
<h3>Supplementation Therapy for Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is not a disease, but it will kill you in the long run! Especially during this winter season, the so-called "If you don't store essence in winter, you will be sick in spring." Although nocturnal emission is not a serious disease, it is extremely dangerous! Because the semen in our body is the so-called secretion of the gonads. This secretion is the main gland that dominates our health, temperament, reproduction, development, and life. Therefore, a person with sufficient essence must be healthy, enthusiastic, and enterprising, and is also an ideal partner for women. Married life is truly infinitely happy! However, ignorant youths often do not know the value of semen. Every time they are sexually impulsive or induced by a bad environment, they have bad habits of masturbation, or early marriage and indulgence, which destroys the sexual nerves. After the sperm barrier is relaxed, nocturnal emission must follow. Smart youths may be aware of it, and on the one hand, they must give up bad habits such as masturbation and indulgence, and on the other hand, they must find a way to cure their nocturnal emission; however, most confused youths do not consider it a disease because nocturnal emission is painless and itchy, and blindly follow the old ways without treatment. When the developmental function stagnates, the metabolism decreases, and symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, and local smallness like fingers break out, it is inevitable that they will harm themselves and others! In the world, there are many youths who suffer from the above-mentioned diseases, resulting in failure to study, failure to learn skills, failure to find love, and in married life after marriage, because the wife is dissatisfied, there are quarrels and discord, private communication and elopement, divorce, suicide and other tragedies!</p>
<p>According to my many years of experience, the only way to treat nocturnal emission is to quickly take the special medicine "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills" to consolidate the sperm barrier and calm the nerves, so that you can receive the magical effect of sleeping peacefully and stopping nocturnal emission that night. Mild cases can be cured by taking it continuously for several days. However, those who have had nocturnal emission for a long time and have the above-mentioned symptoms of deficiency, in addition to actively taking "Hemitots' Spermatogenesis Pills", must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhi Zi" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Regular taking in winter and spring will cure all symptoms and improve health. If patients can come to our clinic for new therapies such as electrotherapy injections, we can guarantee a cure.</p>

<h3>The Public Works Department Will Not Concede on the Issue of Police Power for Road Construction Beyond the Border. A Formal Reply Has Been Sent to the Pseudo-Municipal Government. The Italian Concession Expresses That the Situation Can Be Expected to Be Clarified.</h3>
<p>The information office of the Public Works Department released news yesterday (February 10) saying that the Public Works Department has replied to the suggestions made by the "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an regarding the issue of police power for road construction beyond the border. The reply was delivered to Fu last night (the 19th).</p>
<p>The Italian and Japanese Consuls Accompanied</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post said that the Chairman of the Public Works Department, F.C. Maitland, and the General Manager and President, F.J. Ferry, visited "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an at Fu's residence last night (the 19th), accompanied by the Italian Consul General and Senior Consul of Shanghai, Niloni, and the Japanese Consul General, Miura, and delivered the Public Works Department's reply to Fu's proposal regarding the issue of police affairs for road construction beyond the border. When the reporter asked Fu about the Public Works Department's reply, Fu claimed that he had not yet studied the full text of the Public Works Department's reply, so he refused to make any comments.</p>
<p>Resolutely Reject Joint Patrols</p>
<p>According to informed sources in diplomatic circles last night, the Bureau's reply rejected without hesitation the Pseudo-Municipal Government's suggestion that the Pseudo-Police and Concession Constables jointly patrol the road construction sections beyond the border. It also denied the Pseudo-Municipal Government's right to tax road construction beyond the border, which would further increase the financial difficulties of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>An Agreement May Be Hoped For</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Senior Consul Naroni's opinion on the future of the negotiations, a decision has been made to reach an agreement, so there is no doubt that this issue can be clarified at an early date. A senior official of the Police Station said that the issue of police power is undoubtedly the key point of the dispute. A member of the Finance Committee said that the mention of donations and taxes in the reply was indeed superfluous.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Public Works Rewards Patrolmen for Their Efforts, Braving Great Dangers While Remaining Calm</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, having obtained approval from the board, awarded a First Class Medal for Special Police Merit to Chinese Constable No. 1895. Additionally, Second Class Medals were awarded to Chinese Constables Nos. 570, 1580, and 2919, as well as Indian Constable No. 459. The reason for this was that a large group of over twenty rioters, armed with hand grenades and Mauser rifles, attacked a certain location. After the incident, they split into two groups and fled. At that time, Chinese Constable No. 1895 happened to be on plainclothes duty at the entrance of an alley. Upon hearing the gunfire, he realized the gravity of the situation and immediately, together with Chinese Constable No. 2919, bravely pursued the rioters. One of the rioters threw a hand grenade, and his accomplices opened fire. Chinese Constable No. 1895 was injured in the face and legs by shrapnel, but he still blew his whistle to summon nearby constables. He then attempted to climb onto a trolleybus, but was unable to do so due to excessive blood loss. When a large number of police officers arrived at the scene, he lay in the middle of the road, loading his gun and frantically blowing his police whistle, while waving his plainclothes patrolman's badge to signal approaching officers. The Police Department's Awards Committee noted that despite the constable's young age and short service, he was able to bravely and loyally perform his duty, and even after being injured, he remained calm and composed, which was especially commendable and worthy of emulation. Therefore, he should be awarded a First Class Medal for Special Police Merit to encourage others. Chinese Constables Nos. 570, 1580, and 2919 all assisted in the aforementioned terrorist incident.</p>
<p>When Chinese Constable No. 570 saw a large group of armed rioters, he immediately took up his gun and fired six shots. The rioters threw a hand grenade at him, but it did not explode. At that time, the other rioters, scattering in all directions, opened fire indiscriminately. The constable still bravely pursued them westward. Chinese Constable No. 1580 heard the shots and followed in pursuit. Unexpectedly, as the rioters fled north, fearing interception by the constable, they threw another hand grenade. The constable sought cover and, after the rioters passed by, he re-emerged and opened fire. As a result, one of the criminals was hit, but he himself sustained serious leg injuries. Chinese Constable No. 2919 had previously fired two shots at the rioters and managed to evade the hand grenade explosion. Afterwards, he fired two more shots, but due to the flying bullets, he was unable to capture the rioters. The Police Department's Awards Committee deemed that each of these Chinese constables had faced great danger and fulfilled their duties, and were therefore eligible for the Second Class Medal for Special Police Merit. Furthermore, on the evening of October 20th of this year, Indian Constable No. 459 was directing traffic at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Yu Yuen Road when he was suddenly attacked by a group of armed criminals. The criminals first grappled with the constable, then fired a shot at him, which missed. They then fired another shot, and the bullet entered his chest. The criminals fled in all directions, continuing to fire their guns. After being injured, the constable was unable to pursue the criminals, so he blew his whistle to raise the alarm, while still leaning on the lamppost,</p>
<p>directing traffic and resisting the criminals, preventing his pistol from being seized. This was truly courageous and greatly admired by the public and his colleagues in the Police Department. The Police Department's Awards Committee, having obtained approval from above, awarded him a Second Class Medal for Special Police Merit to encourage him.</p>
<h3>Japan Indicates No Definite Date for Opening Lower Yangtze; Foreign Media Express Skepticism; Restrictions Vary by Port</h3>
<p>Last night, a Japanese spokesman in Shanghai stated at a press briefing: "The Japanese government has announced the opening of the Lower Yangtze for commercial use, and this is now an irreversible policy. However, the continued removal of restrictions on other occupied areas will depend on the attitude of third countries' reactions. Since the Japanese government announced the opening of the Yangtze on the 18th, foreign media have expressed much skepticism, criticizing the ambiguity of the opening date as a 'verbal promise without substance.' This attitude is a misunderstanding of Japan and will have a negative impact on Japanese public opinion. Japan is now sincerely seeking to re-establish normal relations with third countries in the occupied areas of China. The commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Central China share this view and have proposed opening the Yangtze River basin, from Jiangyin to Nanjing, as the 'real' military situation in this area has ended and it is suitable for commercial use." When a foreign reporter asked, "When will foreign ships be able to sail on the Lower Yangtze?" The spokesman did not give any definite indication. Regarding the</p>
<p>trade restrictions that the Japanese side has mentioned, the spokesman also stated that he was unaware of the specifics, but indicated that "each port has its own situation, and there will be different restrictions accordingly, depending on the needs of the local Japanese military for imports and exports." Regarding inquiries about the opening of the Pearl River, the spokesman replied, "This will depend on the decision of the Japanese military authorities in the Philippines." A reporter asked, "The dissatisfaction of the foreign media with</p>
<p>this matter stems from the ambiguous wording of the Japanese statement. What is your opinion?" The spokesman replied, "Regarding the opening of the Yangtze, there are no clear regulations in place, so the statement cannot be vague. However, the Japanese military has done its best to improve everything in the Yangtze River basin, so we feel that the opening is a matter to be considered."</p>
<h3>Food Regulation Association Holds Board Meeting, Exchanges Views, Advocates Cautious Handling, Yu Qiaqing Plans Meeting, Rice Dealers Receive Warning Letter</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Food Regulation Association, regarding the matter of banks advancing funds to order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for relief, Yu Qiaqing and others invited industry leaders to decide on a fundraising method. Yesterday at noon, the association held its first board meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club. Yu Qiaqing, Huang Yanfang, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, Wang Yuqing, Zhang Jiguang, Jiang Yiping, Zhang Nianxuan, Wu Yunqi, Li Wenjie, Lu Gaoyi, and others attended. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported on the process of inviting industry leaders to raise funds for ordering foreign rice. Then, the attendees exchanged views on how to regulate the food supply. The meeting lasted a long time. It is understood that all parties believe that this matter should be handled with caution, so yesterday they only exchanged views and made no concrete decisions. The selection of executive directors and the association's organizational charter were also not discussed. It is also understood that Mr. Yu Qiaqing plans to invite industry leaders for further talks within the next few days before proceeding with everything.</p>
<p>Situation of Rice Shops in the</p>
<p>Extra-Settlement Area</p>
<p>The area around the Great Western Road, Jessfield Road, and Siccawei in the western part of Shanghai, since the rice riots, rice shops have felt frightened and intended to close and stop business, and move the rice to deeper places to hide. Although the panic has subsided, the shops are still afraid and not operating normally. They only put a small amount of indica rice in the rice boxes on the counters for retail sale, barely meeting the market demand, until the rice boxes are empty. Currently, the environment in that area is special. Due to the lack of real security, no one dares to purchase rice, so at present, although the rice industry in Shanghai has largely returned to normal,</p>
<p>all the rice shops have received warnings.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the important rice shops in the city received the same letter successively on the day before yesterday and yesterday. The general content advises each to be honest in business, not to speculate, and to use a portion to help the refugees.</p>
<h3>French Garrison in Hankou Moves Entirely to Shanghai, Two Light Tanks Arrive</h3>
<p>Three hundred and fifty members of the French garrison in Hankou, along with all their military equipment and two light tanks, moved to Shanghai. They arrived yesterday aboard the Wing On liner. It is also learned that the French troops stationed in Hankou have now been completely withdrawn, and there are no plans to refill the garrison temporarily. The French troops transferred to Shanghai are temporarily stationed in the Fulu Li barracks. They may soon go to Vietnam and then to the European front.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-South Africa Route; Dutch Mail Maintained as Usual; SS Real Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>The shipping route between Shanghai and South Africa has been managed by the Dutch Java Mailboat Company, with an average of one sailing per month. It is now learned that since the outbreak of the European war, the Royal Dutch Shipping Company has maintained its service as usual. The Dutch mail ship SS Real, which departed from South Africa at the end of last month via East Africa to Shanghai, will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th of this month. It is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one day, and on the afternoon of the 25th, it will load passengers and cargo in Shanghai and continue sailing to South Africa.</p>

<h3>Affordable Daily Necessities, Purchasing Shanghai and Hong Kong Domestic Goods, Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Crackdown on Hoarding, Funds Allocated by Four Banks for Purchase and Sales</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to crack down on the hoarding of daily necessities and at the same time stipulate affordable purchase and sales methods, has promulgated specific measures and ordered the provincial governments and local chambers of commerce to comply. Emphasis is placed on exploring and purchasing Shanghai and Hong Kong domestic goods. Shanghai businesses can refer to the following excerpts:</p>
<p>Measures to Crack Down on Hoarding</p>
<p>(1) Article 2 of the Measures to Crack Down on Hoarding of Daily Necessities states that the term "daily necessities" as used in these measures is limited to those necessary for people's clothing, food, and daily use. The types will be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs from time to time. Article 3 states that before the Ministry of Economic Affairs designates the daily necessities mentioned in the previous article, it should send personnel to various important cities or entrust the local competent authorities, chambers of commerce, or other organizations to investigate the quantity of inventory, the cost of purchase and transportation, the market supply and demand situation, the latest prices, and the market prices of other related goods. For factories producing daily necessities, it should investigate their production capacity, costs, inventory quantity, and their latest selling prices. Article 4 states that after the Ministry of Economic Affairs conducts the investigation in accordance with the previous article, it may, in accordance with Article 15 of the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period, stipulate fair prices for each designated item based on the local supply and demand situation, encourage merchants to sell at the stipulated prices, and order them to register the quantity of inventory.

Article 10 states that if people store designated daily necessities for their own daily use, the portion exceeding three months' actual needs should be handled in accordance with Articles 6 to 9 of these measures. Article 11 states that if daily necessities that have not been designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs need to be implemented at affordable prices due to current needs, the local price stabilization committee should still handle them in accordance with the Measures for Assessing Commodity Prices and Cracking Down on Speculation and Manipulation During the Emergency Period.</p>
<p>Affordable Purchase and Sales Measures</p>
<p>(2) Article 2 of the Measures for Affordable Purchase and Sales of Daily Necessities states that the term "daily necessities" as used in these measures is limited to those necessary for people's clothing, food, and daily use. The types will be designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs from time to time.

<h3>Japanese Repairing Sihang Warehouse, Opening a Puppet Market</h3>
<p>The Sihang Warehouse at the northern end of the Tibet Road bridge has been occupied by the Japanese since the brave defenders retreated from the position two years ago. Recently, in order to control the supply of vegetables and preserved goods in Shanghai, the Japanese have been extensively repairing the warehouse and building several wooden sheds in the rubble field behind the warehouse, similar in style to the "fish market" in Yangtzepoo. The Japanese soldiers in the sentry boxes, originally one, have now increased to two. When this construction project is completed, the citizens of Shanghai will inevitably feel the increased pressure on their lives due to the strict control of vegetables.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Detains Anping Steamer, Releases After Inspection, Insists the Ship Was Carrying Rice for Export, Inspection Yields Nothing</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that the Japanese naval authorities in charge at the former Water Front Hotel on the Bund released the steamer *Anping* (transliteration) this morning (the 20th). The Japanese detained the ship yesterday afternoon (the 19th) because they suspected the ship was carrying rice out of Shanghai. The same day, naval infantry soldiers inspected the cargo on the *Anping* last night but found no rice. The Japanese authorities then allowed the ship to continue its voyage this morning.</p>
<p>Sailing the Yangtze</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Times* reports that the *Anping*, an 87-foot vessel belonging to the Ying Hui Ji (transliteration) shipping company at 59 Jiangxi Road, was detained by the Japanese naval infantry authorities at 10:30 am yesterday (the 19th) for cargo inspection. The ship is currently being held off the Water Front Hotel on the Bund. According to sources, the *Anping* sails between Shanghai and ports along the Yangtze River, arriving at the Bund approximately every three days.</p>
<p>Preparing to Unload</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, the ship sailed from the No. 3 pontoon on the Bund and arrived at Lujiazui in Pudong, where it was intercepted by the Japanese authorities for cargo inspection. Before the inspection was completed, the ship weighed anchor yesterday morning (the 19th) and sailed back to the Bund, intending to unload cargo. The Shanghai Municipal Council Revenue Office had not received notification of the *Anping*'s detention and sent the ship along the No. 15 pontoon.</p>
<p>Suddenly Detained</p>
<p>As the ship approached the No. 4 anchorage outside the pontoon, preparing to moor, Japanese soldiers arrived in a motorboat, boarded the *Anping*, and forced it to dock at the Japanese-controlled Water Front Hotel. It is said that the *Anping* was detained for cargo inspection and could not return to the Bund without permission because it was suspected of carrying rice.</p>
<p>Inspecting Cargo</p>
<p>However, the shipowner has an export manifest listing the cargo as cigarettes, dates, preserved meats, etc., but no rice. All goods have been inspected by customs, and the manifest is stamped with the customs inspection seal. Furthermore, the Public Concession prohibits the export of rice. However, the Japanese authorities said that they would not pay attention to the manifest and would personally inspect the cargo. It is reported that the *Anping* flies the Japanese flag.</p>

<h3>Rapid Rise in Prices and Rampant Speculation Cause Great Concern Among Shanghai Gentry in Hong Kong; Du Yuesheng and Others Plan to Transfer Funds Inland; National Government Currently Studying Restriction Measures</h3>
<p>The National Government is extremely concerned about the rampant speculation and rapid rise in prices in Shanghai, which is seriously affecting people's livelihoods, and is currently studying restriction measures. In view of the fact that the activity of speculators in Shanghai is due to the abundance of idle funds that are not being used properly, it has decided to encourage investment in various productive enterprises in the interior as much as possible, providing concrete safeguards and preferential interest rates, so that both the country and the people can benefit. Shanghai gentry and financial leaders in Hong Kong, such as Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Wang Xiaolai, are also planning to transfer surplus funds from Shanghai to develop industries in the interior. The Shanghai financial community has always been far-sighted and will be able to fully support this national construction undertaking.</p>
<h3>Police Reserve Force Holds Full Drill; Rare Sight of Entire Force in Camp; Armored Vehicles Deployed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the entire Western, Chinese, and Indian constables of the Shanghai Municipal Police Reserve Force, as well as the drum and bugle corps, held their</p>
<p>first drill in many months</p>
<p>at the Gordon Road police station at 11:30 am yesterday (the 19th).</p>
<p>The reviewers included Assistant Superintendent Van Baarn, who organized the police reserve force thirteen years ago, and Mr. Ewart, an engineer from the British-owned Shanghai General Omnibus Company, who built Shanghai's first armored car in November 1926. The reserve force was divided into four squads, with the entire force in camp at the same time,</p>
<p>which was a rare sight.</p>
<p>The reserve force has quite a few armored vehicles, but the reporter saw two newly added armored vehicles at the scene yesterday. Although the first armored car has been in use for thirteen years, the</p>
<p>distance it has traveled</p>
<p>is more than any other vehicle currently used by the police, but it is still as good as new. During the drill, a signal was given, and over two hundred reserve constables immediately gathered at the scene. The force</p>
<p>leader,</p>
<p>Chamberlain, ordered the four squads to form a line. Less than ten minutes later, the entire force returned to camp, ready to respond immediately to any disturbance in the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Sincere Company Employees' Terms; Hong Kong Side Largely Accepts; Year-End Bonus Distribution to be Negotiated Separately</h3>
<p>More than seven hundred junior and mid-level employees of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road went on strike to demand better treatment from the management. The Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent personnel to mediate and advised them to resume work first. A response to the four demands made by the employees was to be given by the 20th, after consulting with the Hong Kong head office. It is now learned that the Hong Kong head office's reply telegram has arrived in Shanghai. The demands made by labor have been slightly modified. However, regarding the third demand for year-end bonus distribution, the general manager stated that he would need to consult with the Hong Kong side further to fight for it, but he would definitely not disappoint his colleagues. As for the other conditions: (1) Starting this month, a rice allowance of three dollars per person per month will be given. (2) The original three days of supplemental wages will be converted into a permanent subsidy. The other three days will be converted into a temporary special subsidy, starting from New Year's Day next year. (3) Dismissed employees must be given at least one verbal warning in advance, but violations are not subject to this rule. The company</p>
<p>personnel, in order to take the overall situation into account and show the genuine cooperation between labor and management during this extraordinary period, fully accepted this solution from the Hong Kong side and expressed their gratitude for the sympathy and assistance from all parties during the strike.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Road Begins Freight Transport</h3>

<h3>Ships from Hong Kong Still Subject to Routine Quarantine</h3>
<p>The River Inspector's Office of the Jianghai Customs announced yesterday: "Regarding the prevalence of cholera in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou and the regulations for ships arriving from those ports to undergo inspection at a designated anchorage outside Wusongkou, announcements No. 3 on June 17th of this year and No. 4 on June 29th were issued. As there are no longer any cholera epidemics in those ports, the aforementioned inspections should be stopped immediately. However, ships arriving at this port from Hong Kong should still be subject to routine quarantine inspections."</p>
<h3>Airmail Holiday Cards to Europe and America: Today is the Last Day; Will Arrive in England and America on January 1st Next Year</h3>
<p>The Italian postal steamer "Conte Biancamano" is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, via Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, and Colombo, for Europe. The Shanghai Postal Administration will seal and hand over airmail letters and New Year's holiday cards destined for Europe and San Francisco, USA, to the ship to be forwarded separately in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Foreign Residents in Shanghai</p>
<p>Although some foreign residents have stopped sending holiday cards due to the ongoing war in their home countries, many people have been flocking to the post office to send holiday cards and similar items such as calendars and New Year's gifts in recent days. If airmail holiday cards are mailed today, they can all arrive in England and America on January 2nd and 3rd of next year.</p>
<p>Regular New Year's cards destined for Manila, Singapore, Colombo, and other places, if mailed on the ship before 8:00 PM today, can also arrive before the New Year. According to reports, the "Conte Biancamano" can arrive in Hong Kong on the 24th, connecting with the British Royal Airmail (i.e., I.A.L.) and the American route (i.e., P.A.A.) departing from Hong Kong on the 27th of this month on the same day.</p>
<p>Departing from Hong Kong</p>
<p>The British Royal Airmail is scheduled to arrive in London on January 3rd of next year, and the American flight can fly to San Francisco on January 2nd of next year. Therefore, today is the last day for sending airmail holiday cards to the above two places. The post office may extend the</p>
<p>Sealing and Mailing Time</p>
<p>to 11:00 AM tomorrow. According to the itinerary of the "Conte Biancamano", it can arrive in Manila one day after Christmas, Singapore on the 29th, and Colombo on January 3rd of next year, then via Aden, and arrive in London, England, on January 17th.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Shooting in Rongqing Lane, West Shanghai: The Deceased Was Named Peng Jiachun</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, at noon, in front of the Xiangfengchang Weaving Factory at No. 130 Rongqing Lane, Jessfield Road, West Shanghai, an unknown man was shot and killed. A brief account has been published in this newspaper. It is now known that the man's name was Peng Jiachun, 51 years old, and he lived at No. 20 Tangjiazhai, Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui. The cause of his death was that he was attacked by robbers who intended to steal the cat fur coat he was wearing. Because he firmly resisted and tried to escape, he was shot and killed.</p>
<h3>Thugs Kill Each Other</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Yongle Village (transliteration) near the Wujiaochang on Jessfield Road is the general headquarters of thugs. This morning (the 20th) at about 9:30 AM, a thug was shot and injured in a dispute with his accomplices inside the headquarters. Someone nearby called for a fire brigade ambulance, but the Japanese military police and the municipal police at the scene did not allow the injured person to be sent to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Qingyuli Eviction Case: Arguments Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the 25th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Women's Bank and the tenants of Qingyuli on Chongqing Road are involved in an eviction case. It has been heard several times by the Second Branch of the High Court, and the argument period has arrived. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Judges Han Zuzhi, Shen Hong, and Zhang Qinglan opened the court again to</p>
<p>Continue the Arguments</p>
<p>The lawyers representing the tenants, Yuan Yang'an and Su Jingqi, arrived, as did Yuan Hanyun and others, the lawyers representing the Women's Bank. Zuo Deqi, a lawyer commissioned by the Poor Children's Education Institute as a participant, attended the court. The court first asked lawyer Yuan Yang'an about the points raised by the Women's Bank that the names of several tenants were inconsistent. Lawyer Yuan replied that the incorrect names were due to the Women's Bank's mistakes when filing the lawsuit in the first instance, and now the errors have been</p>
<p>Corrected One by One</p>
<p>The Women's Bank's attack on this basis is obviously inappropriate and should be based on the investigation report of the court bailiff. Then lawyer Su continued the argument, stating that (1) the newly established basis has fundamentally shaken the foundation of the original judgment, (2) the date of the extension contract should be based on the original contract obtained by the court's preservation of evidence, and the date and year submitted by the Women's Bank afterward were filled in afterward and cannot be adopted, (3) this case should be subject to</p>
<p>Extension Contract</p>
<p>The fact that the houses are old is not the reason originally requested by the Women's Bank, etc. Next, lawyer Zuo of the Poor Children's Education Institute stated the motives and reasons for signing the extension contract, saying that he still hopes that the Women's Bank will renovate as soon as possible within three years. Finally, lawyer Yuan Yang'an and the lawyers representing the Women's Bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute refuted each other, stating that since the Poor Children's Education Institute has already allowed the Women's Bank</p>
<p>Three Years Grace Period</p>
<p>to renovate, even if the renovation starts as late as January 1, 1942, the Poor Children's Education Institute has no vested interests. Its reason for participation is obviously not established. In short, these are extraordinary times. Once more than 3,000 tenants are evicted, where can they find shelter? Therefore, even if the Women's Bank wants to exercise its contractual rights, it should not do so when it is most harmful to the tenants. The court concluded the arguments and scheduled the judgment for 11:00 AM on December 25.</p>
<h3>Tragic Death of an Orphan: Grandmother Cries in Agony and Suffocates</h3>
<p>Old woman Xu Gu's, 74 years old, lives in Xujiazhai, west of the Hongqiao Road stadium in West Shanghai. Her two sons and one grandson were all killed by Japanese planes during the Shanghai war. She only had a nine-year-old grandson, Fugen, left, who was lonely and helpless and raised by his grandmother Xu Gu's. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday afternoon, Fugen was hit by a Japanese truck on Hongqiao Road and fell to the ground. Later, he was seen by a fellow villager and rescued home. However, because the injury was critical, he died of his injuries yesterday morning. Xu Gu's cried in agony, fainted on the ground, and unexpectedly suffocated to death, following her grandson to the afterlife. The whole family was robbed, which is heartbreaking to hear.</p>

<h3>Terror World: Bloodshed in West Shanghai Repeatedly: Liu Guikuan Was Assassinated Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 9:30 AM yesterday morning, another assassination occurred on Jessfield Road, Baileenan Road, a road built across the border in West Shanghai. The deceased was Liu Guirong, 26 years old, who lived at No. 12 Luyang Village. He died of serious injuries on the spot. The reason for his murder is unknown.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-"Livestock Market" Undergoes Reorganization</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the "Livestock Market" organized by the pseudo-regime in this city, all livestock such as pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks transported to Shanghai from various places must be sold through the "Livestock Market" under unified control. However, due to various measures, difficulties, and pickiness, which are not in line with commercial considerations, brokers have complained incessantly. Moreover, some brokers deliberately manipulate and raise market prices. For example, the price of pork has risen to more than one yuan per catty, and the poor are crying out in pain. It is now learned that there is a sudden reorganization of the "Livestock Market," which has been renamed "Shanghai Livestock Industry Co., Ltd." The pseudo-"Municipal Government" has obtained the consent of the Japanese side, and the capital is set at 3 million yuan, with the "Municipal Government" and the contracting merchants each bearing half. It is said that the reorganization's policy is to severely punish the various malpractices of the previous organization and prevent brokers from manipulating prices to benefit the people's livelihood. However, in fact, it is still feared that it is just a change of name, a false claim.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Embezzlement of Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Lianxing Company at No. 17 Tengfeng Lane, Sichuan Road, is opened by Cantonese Xu Qingcai and specializes in selling various embroidered silk fabrics. However, its usual embroidery work is contracted to Lu Yongsheng of Pudong Embroidery Workshop at No. 33 Ye Jiazhai, Yanping Road, through the introduction of Yan Jieyi. However, Lu, with bad intentions, embezzled all the silk fabrics for embroidery worth 1,500 yuan from Xu from April 1 to July 30 this year, mortgaged them for spending, and disappeared without a trace. Xu learned of this and traced Yan Jieyi, the introducer. It was not until the day before yesterday that Lu Yongsheng was arrested on Chengdu Road and taken to the General Patrol Room. After investigation by Chinese detective Qing Muyou, he was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted according to law. The defendant admitted the embezzlement without denial. Judge Feng sentenced Lu Yongsheng to eight months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<p>Pedestrian Killed in Traffic Accident</p>
<p>At the intersection of Maitehesit Road and Liannaot Road in West Shanghai, a No. 15096 Route 4 bus driving there at about 9:30 PM last night was speeding by.

After hearing the news, street patrolman No. 2956 from the Gordon Road Police Station nearby rushed to the scene, copied the driver's license number, and urgently called a rescue vehicle to transport the body to Baolong Hospital and transfer it to the autopsy room for examination.</p>

The woman tried her best to refuse and was dragged into the alley. Unexpectedly, the woman was still stubborn. The robbers fired more than ten shots, one of which hit the woman's leg, causing her to fall to the ground with blood gushing out. By the time the pseudo-police arrived after hearing the alarm, the robbers had already fled without a trace.</p>

<h3>Shenbao Cup Charity Basketball: China Adds Strong Players; Lu Zhong'en, Zhang Shaoqing, etc. Generously Participate; Second Game Between China and the United States Tonight at 7:00 PM</h3>
<p>In the third Shenbao Cup China-US charity game, the China and US teams are scheduled to meet for the second time at the Xiqing Gymnasium tonight. The game is still scheduled to start at 7:00 PM. In the first game the day before yesterday, the Chinese team suffered an unprecedented defeat because Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, and Shen Yugong, three members of the Hualian team, refused to cooperate, disregarding international honor and charity. Now, the selection committee, in order to remedy the situation, decided to select good players again, hoping to fight to the death with the American team and achieve the ultimate victory. It has now been decided to reject Li and the other three and submit them to public opinion. On the one hand, strong players Lu Zhong'en, Zhang Shaoqing, and Zhou Wenyong are invited to help in the battle. Fortunately, there are still two games to go, and it is not too late to catch up. The Chinese lineup has been reorganized this time and is naturally different from the day before yesterday. Although the US team is very arrogant, victory is not necessarily guaranteed, but at least there should be some hope, and it can be predicted that the game will become tense, the score will be close, and the audience will be given wonderful shots. Tickets are still limited to 300 upstairs and 154 downstairs, divided into two types: 2 yuan and 1 yuan, which are still pre-sold at Shenbao and Xiqing YMCA. Because there were too few tickets the day before yesterday, many people were unable to attend. It is hoped that you will purchase them as soon as possible to see the strength of the Chinese team after it has been reorganized. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>(Chinese Team) Lu Zhong'en, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhou Wenyong, Chen Xianglong, Xu Wenkui, Sun Huipei, Zhang Jiakui, Chen Bangzhen, Zhuo Guorong, Wang Nanqun, Li Zude, Yu Xunzi,</p>
<p>(American Team) Pasico, Hughes, Baudusi, Kelaisi, Tengqintuo, Robert Xu, Hensahuizi, Tinghuaer, Carson, Gaoxu,</p>
<h3>China-US Charity Basketball Game: The Organization Process of the Chinese Team; The Truth About the Refusal of Hualian Players to Attend; Sportsmanship and Sports Ethics Are Swept Away</h3>
<p>The third Shenbao Cup China-US charity basketball game, the organization and selection process of the Chinese representative team this time is as follows: This year, in order to avoid disputes among the teams about the number of players selected from each team, the selection committee took an absolutely neutral stance and selected suitable players without using the team as a unit. The organizers invited individual players from each team separately. The selected candidates may not be perfect, but it is inevitable that some outstanding players will be missed. All parties unanimously expressed sympathy for international honor and charity, but Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Shen Yugong, and others raised objections, saying that too few Hualian team members were selected and that it was necessary to select Ren Xiangcheng and Bao Songyuan from the team. The selection committee believed that since a decision had been made, it would be impossible to deal with other teams if it arbitrarily added to one team at the request of one team. After discussion with Li and others, Li said that although the organizers invited each individual to participate, they were members of the Hualian Sports Association and needed to consult with Chairman Ji Kunsheng. So they discussed with Ji, but Ji's attitude was even more resolute, proposing three players from the team, Xu Zhaoxiong, Bao Songyuan, and Ren Xiangcheng, saying that they must be selected. Together with those who have already been selected, there are a total of seven people, and the captain must also be a Hualian player. Otherwise, we would rather withdraw from the game, which is close to coercion. So after repeated consultations, Ji did not make any concessions of sympathy. Finally, a friend used personal feelings to urge Li and others to take the overall situation into consideration and attend the game, but Li and others never replied, which shows their arrogant attitude. The quality of the selected players is a question, but the fact</p>
<p>That the Yilian wants to send the entire team of seven players to represent the team, whether it is appropriate and adequate, is a common sight. Judging from the defeat of the Hualian team in the game against the Cubs, it is even more questionable. Players are not goods, and there is no reason to raise them and lose their freedom. Promoting sports is not about monopolizing athletes in this way. It is even more absurd to want to become a player trust. At a time when sports administrative organs have successively withdrawn to the west or suspended work since the war, there should be a spirit of observing sports discipline and promoting sportsmanship. If we take advantage of this national crisis and disregard sports ethics, we should be abandoned by the Chinese sports community.</p>
<h3>Xiqing Basketball Game Yesterday: Yilian Lost to Military Officers: 45 to 40, Free Throws Became Key; In the Second Division Game, Guangshi Greatly Defeated the Zhendan Team</h3>
<p>There were originally three Xiqing basketball games last night. The last game between Qianghua and Huqing was rescheduled because they had to participate in the China-US charity basketball game. The results of the second division were recorded. Guangshi won a great victory over Zhendan with 46 to 16. In the first division game between Yilian and the military officers, the battle was very tense. The military officers took the lead with 22 to 20 in the first half. After the restart, Yilian chased to 30 to 33. After that, Xiao Lu made two shots and one free throw, and the score was tied at 35 each. At this point, the situation was extremely tense, and there were less than three minutes left until the end of the game. Unfortunately, Shen Ji'en committed two consecutive fouls and was sent off the field. Lu Shunde's shot bounced out after hitting the hoop, and his bad luck could not be remedied. After that, Hang Sihui scored two free throws, and Robert Xu and Wang Erde successively hit the target. Yilian finally suffered a crushing defeat with 40 to 45.</p>

<p>Guangshi won Zhendan (Second Division) 46-16</p>

<h3>Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (9)</h3>
<p>Regarding the standards listed on the right, there are three points we want to specifically explain. First, the so-called examination districts and nearby districts are fixed and regulated. For example, the schools in the Chongqing district are National Central University, Chongqing University, and Jiangsu Medical College. The nearby districts are Chengdu, Guiyang, and Enshi. For the first to third choices, students from the Chongqing district will be given priority for admission to the three universities like National Central University. Any remaining slots will be filled by students from the nearby three districts according to their choices. Other districts will follow this pattern. Second, the distribution process is also detailed. For example, for the first choice, students from the same graduating school are categorized first, then those with the same academic background, then the students in each department are ranked by academic performance. Students are then admitted to each department in order of merit until the department is full. Unfilled spots remain open. Cross-checking is performed to ensure accuracy. The procedure is complex and must not be messed up. Third, the assignment of schools and departments is taken very seriously, with seven members designated by the Unified Enrollment Committee to decide the matter in a meeting. The principles used are: (1) schools are different, but departments are the same; (2) based on the three identical department choices or two department choices; (3) based on the first department choice; (4) based on location; (5) if the situation is the same, then order of merit is used. If, according to the above items, all spots are filled and no further distribution is possible, a last resort will be taken: assigning a department with a similar nature, but this must still be reasonably limited. For example, mechanical engineering can be assigned to textile engineering or the physics department, chemical engineering to the chemistry department, and political science to the law department, etc. However, there are not many students this year that have their department changed. Details can be seen in the second half of this section. (2) Analysis of Preferences: This year's unified entrance examination applicants (the enrollment list for Shanghai district students was not sent, so there are no preferences) and the recommended students have two very obvious phenomena: first, they are concentrated in a few schools; second, they are concentrated in a few departments. Details are in the table below. National Central University enrolled (hereinafter referred to as "enrolled") 17,189 for the first choice (hereinafter represented by the character "A"), 601 for the second choice (hereinafter represented by the character "B"), and 305 for the third choice (hereinafter represented by the character "C"). Recommended (hereinafter referred to as "recommended") 106 for first choice (A), 83 for second choice (B), and 74 for third choice (C). National Southwest Associated University enrolled A 1,019, B 502, C 285. Recommended A 66, B 58, C 41. Wuhan University enrolled A 293, B 340, C 233. Recommended A 24, B 40, C 35.

Guangxi University enrolled A 2, B 3, C 5. Recommended A 2, B 1, C 2. Jiaotong University Tangshan College of Engineering enrolled A 405, B 48, C 53. Recommended A 16, B 20, C 13. Northwest Institute of Technology enrolled A 57, B 48, C 71. Recommended A 2, B 5, C 7. Northwest Agricultural College enrolled A 20, B 6, C 7. Recommended B 1, C 1. National Teachers College enrolled A 155, B 30, C 17. Recommended B 4. Northwest Normal College enrolled A 84, B 10, C 13. Recommended A 3, B 1. Zhongzheng Medical College enrolled A 35, B 38, C 2. Recommended A 2, B 4, C 3. Guiyang Medical College enrolled A 12, B 16, C 10. Recommended C 3. Northwest Medical College enrolled A 14, B 8, C 1. Jiangsu Medical College enrolled A 10, B 13, C 6. Recommended A 2. Chongqing University enrolled A 18, B 12, C 30. Recommended C 6. Henan University enrolled A 6, B 2, C 4. Special students returning to their original school enrolled A 3. Total first choice enrollments were 4,518.</p>
<p>The preferences listed in the table above refer specifically to schools in the rear area. Students in the inland applying to schools in Shanghai are not included because regulations do not permit it. The discrepancy between the total number of preferences and the total number of applicants is due to this reason. Let's examine the table: those who chose National Central University and National Southwest Associated University account for more than a quarter of all enrolled or recommended students. How can distribution not be difficult? Let's also examine the department choices and their categories, which fully demonstrate the general concentration. A list of the departments and the number of first choices is as follows:</p>
<p>College of Arts: 245 applicants (Chinese 48, Foreign Languages 102, Philosophy 17, History 68, Sociology 10); College of Law: 758 applicants (Law 42, Politics 268, Economics 448); Teachers College: 608 applicants (Chinese 29, English 59, History and Geography 78, Public Training 50, Education 218, Mathematics 18, Physics and Chemistry 49); College of Engineering: 2,022 applicants (Civil Engineering 522, Mechanical Engineering 447, Electrical Engineering 268, Aeronautics 384, Chemical Engineering 203, Architecture 30, Water Conservancy 75, Mining and Metallurgy 91, Textile 2); College of Science: 186 applicants (Mathematics 26, Physics 31, Chemistry 62, Astronomy 1, Geography 16, Biology 17, Geology 18, Geology Geography and Meteorology 12); College of Agriculture: 215 applicants (Agronomy 72, Horticulture 26, Agricultural Chemistry 53, Forestry 14, Animal Husbandry 27, Veterinary Medicine 7, Agricultural Economics 10, Plant Diseases and Pests 3, Agricultural Water Conservancy 10). Total: 4,518 applicants. Considering the highest number of first choices for each department in each school, Central Aviation Department had 221, Mechanical Engineering Department 155, Civil Engineering Department 109, Electrical Engineering Department 108, Southwest Associated University Aviation Department 160, Mechanical Engineering Department 143, Civil Engineering Department 119, Tangshan College of Engineering Civil Engineering Department 178, Railway Management Department 179, Central Economics Department 183, Political Science Department 141, Southwest Associated University Economics Department 131, Wuhan University Economics Department 103, while the maximum capacity of each department is 20 to 70. Apart from comparing the scores of applicants with the same department choice, there is no other good method. However, as a result of the comparison, each department must eliminate at least two-thirds or more. It can be seen that the more concentrated the preferences, the better the performance of the enrolled students, and at the same time, distribution becomes very difficult.</p>
<p>(3) Distribution Results: After reading the above analysis of applicants' preferences, it is known that distribution is the most difficult task. The results of distribution according to distribution standards and procedures are as follows:</p>

<h3>High-Grade White Japonica Rice Still Not Being Sampled, Kunshan Inferior Japonica Rice Actually Sold at Limit Price, Market Has Become the World of Foreign Rice, People's Food Not Worried About Having No Rice to Cook</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from various inland regions were still under the control of certain parties. Only large quantities of foreign rice arrived in port in an endless stream, which made people more relaxed. In addition, although general merchants made additional purchases, they still did not dare to prepare too much. Therefore, most transactions were only in small quantities and lacked large deals. Stockholders and merchants, although they held a lot of thick and thin Japonica high-priced goods, still refused to provide samples. However, goods with a weaker body and mid-section were still seeking to be sold off. Moreover, large quantities of foreign rice were all being dumped. For a time, the chips on the market showed an oversupply. The purchase price of goods was difficult to maintain, and sellers all offered price reductions to attract customers. As a result, very few transactions were concluded for each type of goods. According to city statistics, it was only 3,000 to 4,000 bags. Although the market price of thick and thin Japonica rice seemed to be unchanged on the surface, it was actually lower by 30 to 50 cents due to the difference in quality compared to the previous market. At closing, Kunshan inferior Japonica and Tongli white Japonica were both 40 yuan, Li Sheng medium Japonica 39 yuan, Qing Si special thin 40 yuan, large city 39.5 yuan, Feng Jia and Nangan early and late rice 38.5 yuan. Lu Jian and Yang Jian goods were rare and uniquely flat. Lu Jian was quoted at 38.5 yuan, Yang Jian 37.5 yuan. Jiangbei Jian was opened at the limit price of 33 yuan (see the market price column for details). As for Saigon sharp rice, the market supply was the most abundant, and the price reduction was greater, at 35.7 to 35 yuan, which was a drop of 50 cents to 1 yuan compared to the previous market. Broken rice was 31 yuan, determined to be 29 yuan, and the downward trend was still similar. Tokyo sharp rice was 32 yuan, 31.5 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market, but since the price was too inferior to Saigon rice, most owners were unwilling to compare them. Moreover, light rice could maintain its original price, but only 300 to 400 bags were traded on one side. Changbang Baiyuan was 40 yuan, and Danyang Baiyuan was 39 yuan, which was also average.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been imported continuously, so there is absolutely no concern about people's food. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Nanran Wheel shipped 6,077 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and 2,889 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 8,966 bags. The unloading was completed last night.</p>
<h3>Wheat Price Continues to Rise, Flour Is Clearly Stable but Covertly Tight</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market was clearly stable but covertly firm. It was found that the No. 2 flour factory's price was still 8.7 yuan. In order to maintain this street, the factories still supplied as much as possible. However, the situation of returned goods became tight again, because it was rumored that the wheat price had reached a high peak of 15.15 yuan, and people seemed to feel better. Therefore, the buying sentiment for Japanese factory flour was strong again. Phoenix brand for December opened at 8.056 yuan, then rose to 0.18 yuan. January also rose from 8.467 yuan to 8.5 yuan. A total of more than 40,000 bags were traded on the market, with local and foreign merchants each taking half. Actual sales accounted for two-fourths. Today, 4,500 bags will be exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market was still firm. It was said that the price of high wheat was more than 0.15 yuan above 15 yuan, all due to the high price in the inland and the lack of sources. A total of five cars were traded on the market. Guandian and Su Kun wheat were quoted at 15 yuan to 14.75 yuan. Fuxin and Fufeng two factories jointly handled 4,500 bags of Su Xi Zhenjiang wheat, priced at 15 yuan to 14.9 yuan. Pudong wheat was 14.55 yuan. There were also 1,860 bags of beans transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Plummets, Truth Revealed</h3>
<p>Although this newspaper had a market price report for the sharp drop in soybean oil prices the day before yesterday (the 19th), there was no news published because, after examining the market sentiment for the past two days, the state of weakness should not be so disparate. Therefore, it was omitted. As this newspaper expected, the market was in turmoil yesterday, and a large number of people rose up to question the situation. However, there is no wave without wind. At the close of the day (the 19th), there was a batch of off-market transactions, but the price opened was quite secret. It was rumored to be 10 yuan lower than the price of the previous day. Although general powerful figures are wholeheartedly trying to control the potential trend ahead, actual sales are not rising, sources are still coming in, and there are environmental constraints, so it may be difficult to reverse this sluggish situation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diao Qing Must Settle Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much change in foreign sugar. The association's price for spot goods was 59.5 yuan for crude white sugar at the local warehouse, 59.7 yuan to 59.5 yuan at the foreign warehouse, and 59 yuan for those arriving in May. Transshipment goods were still 48 yuan. Tai Gu car white was slightly smaller. West Warehouse B mark was 60 yuan, East Warehouse 59.5 yuan, West Warehouse CW mark 59.5 yuan, CX mark 59 yuan, DY mark 58.5 yuan, HX mark 58 yuan, H mark car red 45 yuan, Dutch red 46.5 yuan. Local refined white and No. 1 ice sugar were unchanged. National sugar opened dozens of bags of Xinghua Qing, 42 yuan, ordinary cotton red 46 yuan, and other calling prices increased, but no transactions were made. It was also reported that starting from January 1, 29th year of Republic, all goods exported from Zhangzhou must first settle foreign exchange. If so, Diao Qing would also be no exception. Also, 470 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Finance: Importers Settle Spot and Forward Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The dark market for British and American exchange saw a reversal today after four consecutive days of loosening. However, there were no other news. This was entirely because there were many settlements in the foreign firm sector. The process in the first half of the day: British exchange was slightly tight at the opening in the morning, while American exchange was average. Shortly after, Sassoon sold slightly, and Hong Kong also sold at the same time, but there was demand from Netherlands and Elly, so the loosening was limited. At that time, British gold was 4 765625, and American exchange was 7.84375. Soon after, major foreign firms had a strong demand, and they rushed to buy from the market. Moreover, various importers with a smaller scope also secretly purchased to settle, and banks took advantage of the situation to raise prices. In less than half an hour, British gold tightened to 4 6875, and American exchange also softened to 7.65625. After 10:30, the buying spree gradually subsided, and the market situation stabilized. Until the close, there was no significant change. The closing price of British gold was still 4 6875, and American exchange was 7.6875, resulting in a softening of 0.078125 and 0.125 compared to the previous day. The potential of futures was still similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>Tightening After Four Consecutive Days of Loosening</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London large strips were 0.0625 higher for the near term and 0.125 higher for the long term. The New York silver price rose by 0.375. The London raw gold was not determined. The exchange rate for British exchange against American and French exchange was average, and against Shanghai it was higher by 0.0625. American exchange was unchanged against British exchange, higher against Shanghai by 0.05, and significantly higher against French exchange by 0.125. The central listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. At the opening of the bank this morning, the selling price of spot goods was British gold at 4 75 and American exchange at 7.8125, which was tighter by 0.015625 for British exchange and no change for American exchange compared to the previous close. After the opening, Sassoon first sold to the market, and Hong Kong Power also sold, but the number was limited, and the demand from Netherlands and Elly was good, so the loosening in the market was minimal. Sassoon sold spot British gold to Netherlands for 4 765625 and British gold for January for 4 75. Then, Hong Kong Power sold spot American exchange to Datong Netherlands Elly and a certain bank for 7.8125. At that time, HSBC's buying price once returned to 7.84375. The balance tax announced by HSBC was unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be large 0.25. After that, major foreign firms frequently settled their spot and forward payments, and foreign firms with smaller scopes also secretly bought and sold, and Hong Kong Power stopped supplying, so the situation suddenly softened. By 10:15, British gold had softened to 4 6875, and American exchange had also tightened to 7.65625. Later, there were fewer buyers, and the situation stabilized. Until noon, there was no further change. The noon closing price for spot goods at the bank was British gold at 4 6875 and American exchange at 7.6875. British gold for this month was 4 671875, American exchange was 7.65625. British gold for January was 4 65625, and American exchange was 7.5625. As a result, British exchange and American exchange all softened by 0.078125 compared to the day before yesterday. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rose Six Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened stably this morning. All exchanges were unchanged compared to yesterday's close. At 10:55, the spot Shanghai exchange rose by five yuan to 317 yuan. At 11:30, the spot Shanghai exchange rose by another yuan to 318 yuan. The market was stable. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Rose and American Unchanged</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British exchange loosened by 0.0625 to 4 pence and a half. American and Shanghai exchange were unchanged, still at 7.375 and 105.5 yuan. The "United Notes" in the dark market continued to rise by 0.25 to 93.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Turn Firmer, American Gold Notes Rise to 13 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for American gold and British pound recovered strongly. Customers took advantage of the low prices to snap up gold notes, and market prices rebounded sharply. The supply of Hong Kong dollars was still smooth, and the market situation was weak. French francs and Annam dollars were firm due to travel needs. Demand for Japanese notes recovered strongly, and market prices were tight. The evening market was 1.305 yuan. Fresh notes supply increased, and the market was slightly soft. The evening market was 1.1112 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British American gold and British pounds all rose by one yuan, British gold notes rose by 0.7 yuan, Americans by 0.13 yuan, Hong Kong dollars fell by 0.01 yuan, French francs rose by 0.02 yuan, Annam dollars rose by 0.02 yuan, and others were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Turns from Loose to Tight, Cash Re-enters Good Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the dark market situation for cash rose sharply as the exchange market softened, and the result was a rebound of 36 yuan. However, operators were cautious and unwilling to buy in and increase their positions when prices rose. The initial opening during the day was still weak, because foreign exchange showed a slight loose state at this time. A certain money exchange industry forcibly sold at a price, and the opening price was 4,090 yuan, which was 18 yuan lower. Then, a certain bank and others bought it on behalf of customers, pulling it up by 30 yuan. However, the silver shop gang and a certain money exchange industry resold it, and it fell back to 4,105 yuan. After that, the exchange market turned tight, which boosted the morale of buyers. Gold shops, securities gangs, and money exchange industries entered the market to bid, and the price soared to a high peak of 4,150 yuan. Then, as the foreign exchange stabilized, the multi-party thinking was not long-term, and they slowly took profits. Therefore, the noon closing price slightly fell to 4,140 yuan. The situation in the afternoon was average, with only 7 yuan of fluctuation. As a result, the closing price was 4,144 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about 2,000 taels. The silver shop's jewelry gold was listed at a high of 5 yuan, and the customs gold was still flat.</p>
<p>Rose by Thirty-Six Yuan</p>
<p>Since the initial opening this morning, the exchange market was slightly loose and a certain money exchange industry sold at a suppressed price on behalf of customers, the opening price was lowered by 18 yuan, sold to the securities gang for 30 taels at 4,090 yuan. Shortly after, the number of buyers increased due to the low price. A certain gold shop and a certain bank competed to buy strongly, and it was pulled up by 30 yuan. The gold shop sold to the silver shop gang for 30 taels at 4,120 yuan. Then, because the silver shop gang continued to sell, and a certain money exchange industry restarted selling, the price was suppressed to 4,105 yuan. At that time, the exchange market suddenly reported a tightening, and the degree of tightening was quite fast, which boosted morale. Securities gangs, gold shops, and money exchange industries mutually released and bought, and before long, it jumped by 45 yuan. The securities gang entered the money exchange industry for 20 taels at 4,150 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange stabilized, and a certain bank's long-term thinking was not long-term, so they took profits at a high level, immediately returning 15 yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the money exchange industry for 4,135 yuan. Although gold shops and others sold later, the securities gang and a certain cash gold shop had good appetites, the positions were balanced, and the price fluctuated around 4,140 yuan. Until the close, the securities gang entered the money exchange industry for 10 taels, still reporting the noon closing price of 4,140 yuan. The potential in the afternoon was calm. The first opening was raised by 5 yuan. The silver shop gang traded 10 taels of money exchange industry, 4,145 yuan. Then a certain money exchange industry also came to salvage, and the price continued to rise by 4 yuan. Money exchange industries traded 20 taels with each other, for 4,149 yuan. After entering, retail investors and gold shops released, and the price stepped down by 7 yuan. The money exchange industry released 10 taels to the silver shop gang, for 4,142 yuan. Later, the gold shop entered the money exchange industry for 20 taels, for 4,144 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose by 36 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total of 60 yuan of fluctuation. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the gold, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at 5 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>At the beginning, the exchange price of gold jewelry per tael was still suspended at 415 yuan by Datong Bank. By 10:30, it was listed at 5 yuan higher. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Datong Bank changed the suspension to 420 yuan. The new banks were the same as the above price, and the purchase was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Where Have the New Subsidiary Coin Notes Gone?</h3>
<p>Since the wholesale banks have distributed coin notes in order to correct past malpractices, allocating them to various banks and industries, it was thought that they would circulate extensively on the market. However, according to what we have heard and seen, the amount received by each industry is not much, and the amount received by each bank is also said to be small. What circulates on the market is still the old or newly issued streetcar and public bus fare vouchers. Subsidiary coin notes can be said to be rarely seen and hard to come by. If 1 million subsidiary coin notes were issued, taking 1 cent notes as an example, there would be 100,000,000 notes. Taking a step back, if we calculate 1 cent and 5 cent notes each as 500,000 yuan, there should also be 50,000,000 1 cent notes and 10,000,000 5 cent notes. If there were such a large number of chips on the market, it would definitely not still be using fare vouchers. So why are subsidiary coin notes still rarely seen? If they are not being stored in the treasury or private boxes of various parties, then there is much room for consideration in the issuing procedures.</p>
<p>Speaking of one-yuan notes and corner coin notes, what we have seen recently is nothing more than tattered and decayed banknotes. Bad money drives out good, which can be applied everywhere. However, we still see advertisements in the newspapers claiming that new one-yuan notes have arrived in the amount of tens of millions of yuan, and that there is no shortage of subsidiary coin notes. But the facts are as they are. Perhaps the goods are not flowing smoothly.</p>
<h3>Bank Current Account Interest Yesterday</h3>
<p>The end of June and the end of December each year are the periods for banks to handle semi-annual account closures. The tenth of June and December are the periods for semi-annual interest calculation for current savings and current deposits. Since the outbreak of the war, many fixed deposits and savings in various banks have been converted into current accounts for expenditure. Therefore, yesterday (the 20th), various banks handled the current interest calculation for current deposits this period. The internal operations were very busy. Some banks with a large number of current account holders required their staff to work until late at night to complete the task. As for depositors, they can bring their passbooks to the bank to register the interest from today. If the passbook is not registered today, it can be registered during the next deposit or withdrawal of funds.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Lacks Sustained Momentum; Foreign Stocks Await After Christmas</h3>
<p>The securities grey market showed further weakness yesterday, with a renewed lack of investor confidence, and returning to a sideways trading pattern. Trading activity therefore gradually declined. The inability to rally under these conditions is primarily due to the lack of solid fundamental support, making it difficult to expect significant prosperity or decline in the short term. At the opening yesterday, investor sentiment was still firm due to a slight gain in the Joint Venture shares. Class C shares once reached a high price of 8.15 yuan, but were then heavily sold by Sinchong, Yuen Lee, Datung, and Chiu Fung, causing Class C shares to break below the 8 yuan level, which dampened investor confidence. Therefore, the afternoon saw an even more sluggish market, with all bonds weak and unable to rise. Number 40 bonds saw considerable selling, resulting in a uniform decrease of about 0.03 yuan. The total transaction volume was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: Open Bright Real Estate Company (formerly located at Nine Acres in the city), shares, 100 shares, priced at 3.40 yuan (par value of 10 yuan per share).</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce lacked vitality, with minimal price fluctuations. Given the current weakening of foreign exchange rates, the market appears to be temporarily entering a period of quiet, with a possible turnaround after the holidays.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Cotton Declines; Local Cotton Seen as Weak; Tonghua Cotton Dropped Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>The trading volume of local cotton has greatly decreased. This is because overseas Indian and American cotton markets have uniformly trended downward, leading to further declines in investor confidence. Industry participants are generally bearish, considering prices to be already high and taking a wait-and-see approach before taking action. Therefore, market prices are weak. The selling prices of both Tonghua cotton and raw cotton have decreased by 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous day. Tonghua cotton from the Subei source is estimated at 573 bales, Changyinsha at 658 bales, and Beisha at 380 bales. The current selling prices of raw cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Tongzhou 170.00 Shenxin Purchase 500 bales</p>
<p>Changyinsha 168.00 Shenxin Purchase 500 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou 165.00 Peer Purchase 200 bales</p>
<p>Grass Bales 155.00 Peer Purchase 200 bales</p>
<p>Tonghua 168.00 Shenxin Purchase 500 bales</p>
<p>Tonghua 164.00 Peer Purchase 200 bales</p>
<p>Another report: The market price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market opened weak yesterday morning. In addition, telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported declines, and all parties planned to take profits and spend a quiet Christmas and New Year. Later, Southern traders engaged in market selling, resulting in a very weak market and the lowest closing price, down 20 points from the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by more than 10 rupees, Egyptian cotton fell by 40 points, and Liverpool cotton fell by 6 to 7 pence.</p>
<p>The spot trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet, both for Chinese and foreign manufacturers. Traders previously purchased futures on the New York Stock Exchange and have now gained substantial profits. They also plan to follow the example of Europe and the United States by taking profits and then celebrating Christmas and the end of the year. Therefore, traders have already begun to gradually close out their futures positions from yesterday. The market price of foreign cotton yesterday, converted to factory prices based on an exchange rate of 7.6875 yuan for US dollars, is as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American middling 230.85</p>
<p>Also Also Lower grade 136.60</p>
<p>32 count Also 237.70</p>
<p>Also Also Lower grade 231.70</p>
<p>42 count Also 241.10</p>
<p>Also Also Lower grade 233.45</p>
<h3>Actual Demand is Too Sluggish; Cotton Yarn Faces Heavy Pressure</h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly in a state of sideways trading, but with the rising trend of declines in overseas cotton markets, new buyers are increasingly hesitant and uncertain, lacking the firmness of previous sentiments. In addition, with the approach of the end of the year and the nearing of the closing period, business has experienced a temporary standstill, resulting in a more scattered market situation. Therefore, customer sales remain sluggish and weak. However, most traders are generally in a bullish position and have absorbed a sufficient amount, so they naturally do not see it as a small matter. The fundamental problem is still that actual demand is too sluggish and the pressure is relatively heavy.</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn market this morning saw a slight weakening of investor sentiment due to the large decline in American cotton and the intensification of the declining trend. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 711 yuan, a decrease of 9 yuan compared to the previous day. However, after the price decreased, the bulls instead remained steadfast and did not move, so the market situation became calm again for a long time. Subsequently, news of a reduction in foreign exchange rates caused a sudden increase in buying activity, and the situation became lively again. The market price gradually rebounded to 722 yuan, but after the price increased, there were many sellers again, resulting in a slight decrease after the close. According to statistics, the trading volume for the half-day was 1,185 bales. The market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn decreased by 1 yuan, Tian Nu yarn decreased by 2 yuan, and Double Earth yarn increased by 2 yuan. Today, 300 pieces of yarn are being transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Peers 1,045 Sichuan 50</p>
<p>Hong Kong 45 Inland 45</p>
<p>Total 1,185</p>
<p>Causing Tianjin Buyers to Scour for Dongbu Cloth; Domestic Cloth Sales Remain Strong</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Rumor of Tianjin Establishing a Piece Goods Exchange Causes Tianjin Buyers to Scour for Dongbu Cloth; Domestic Cloth Sales Remain Strong</h3>
<p>The current sales of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Nanyang groups continue to develop. In addition, with the tightening of foreign exchange rates, the demand in this street has suddenly increased. The selling prices in the morning market were slightly less than the previous day. In the afternoon, they uniformly increased. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and coarse and fine twill increased by 0.10 to 0.15 yuan per piece. Bleached cloth and colored cloth increased by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan per piece. This street traded more than 500 pieces of white goods and bleached and dyed goods. The Yongshao group purchased nearly 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and bleached cloth. The Wanjiang group purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth and striped bleached cloth fine cloth from Ewo, Lun Chang, and Shenxin factories. The Chuandian group purchased more than 5,000 pieces of blue cloth, woolen cloth, and colored twill. The Nanyang group purchased more than 6,000 pieces of bleached cloth, printed poplin, and colored satin. Ten pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin on the 20th.</p>
<p>The opening of Dongbu white goods in the morning was flat. Later, due to the filling of orders by peers in this street, fine cloth and fine twill uniformly rebounded. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning was 21.35 yuan. Later, there were rumors that the Tianjin Piece Goods Exchange was about to be established. Tianjin buyers scoured for spot goods to use as collateral, purchasing 700 bales of fine cloth from brands such as Dragon Call, Flying Fish, and Trumpet. The market atmosphere suddenly tightened, and selling prices soared. The highest price for Dragon Head fine cloth was 21.65 yuan, and the closing price slightly decreased to 21.60 yuan. Foreign firms opened 400 bales of spot fine cloth for this month: Trumpet and Colored Ball at 20.03 yuan, Blue Phoenix at 20.02 yuan, and Flying Fish at 21 yuan. Compared to yesterday, the price of fine cloth increased by 0.50 to 0.75 yuan, and the price of fine twill increased by about 0.50 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Greatcoat Fabrics in High Demand</h3>
<p>The inventory of greatcoat fabrics is dwindling, and with the current cold weather, demand is high. Friendship, Tianguan Tu, all-wool, and Zhao Ji's Lao Gong Mao, Xie Li, and other gray wool greatcoat fabrics are selling even more actively. Most of the major wholesale traders have sold out their stocks one after another, so market prices are rising exceptionally strongly.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Persimmon Cakes Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>After the new persimmon cakes were listed, the arrival of goods was not strong, so the momentum was quite firm. Another 100 cases of boxed persimmon cakes have arrived. The higher-quality ones are selling for 32 yuan to 30 yuan, with a decision at 28 yuan. Groups in this street and others all have demand, and there is little hope for relaxation in the short term. In addition, 149 boxes of cinnamon sticks were transported from Xiamen yesterday.</p>
<h3>Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars Soar</h3>
<p>The market for ribbed steel bars, which had been quiet for a long time, saw strong demand from construction groups in this street yesterday. In addition, groups from Yantai, Qingdao, and Tianjin also actively purchased them. The supply of goods in the market was insufficient, so traders hoarded them and allowed small retail buyers to negotiate prices. Wholesale trading yesterday reached a massive 360 tons, setting a new record since the price increases. Therefore, investor confidence is strong. Standard market prices are 800 yuan per ton for 3/4 inch and 750 yuan for 5/8 inch to 1 inch, an increase of 10 to 20 yuan compared to the previous market. As the stock of this commodity in Shanghai is not large, the market is expected to rise further.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Tea Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, European traders were hesitant to purchase green tea because the exchange rate had been frequently easing recently, and Chinese merchants were asking for even higher prices than before. Only Baochang, Yongxing, and other firms in the city purchased more than 80 cases of Zhenmei tea, with prices ranging from 82 yuan to 94 yuan, with no change from before. In addition, more than 100 packages of Xiumei and Huaxiang teas were purchased by groups from Pingjin, with prices ranging from 47 to 48 yuan, and the market was also good. In addition, 29 pieces of tea were transported to Hong Kong today.</p>

<h3>On Tension</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>The opposite of leisure is tension. The meaning of tension includes both external tension (the tension of the environment) and internal tension. First, the chaos and turbulence of the external world, or the sudden arrival of an event, stimulate internal emotions, feelings, and associations, indirectly creating a sense of psychological tension. External and internal tension can be said to belong to the same realm, with the only difference being a slight variation in their external and internal aspects. We know that it is not easy to be a "calm observer" when one is tense. However, the principles of literary creation tell us that we must be an observer. In fact, tourists in the Alps rarely truly appreciate the mountain scenery, despite seeing the signs along the way. However, it is equally good to extract material from memories. Truly moving, magnificent, and great material often reappears after tension. The turbulence and chaos of the world are a reversal of the usual dull way of life.</p>
<p>The convergence of external events agitates the tranquil mind. All kinds of dormant emotions stir at this time, erupting into inspiration. The greater the pressure on life, the greater the reaction. Stone is chiseled into sparks, which, according to Han Yu, can also be said to be an example of the stone's inability to remain still, using fire to sound (in a broad sense). This inspiration arises from the moment of reaction under immense pressure, with myriad images being sent off with the eye and wielded by the hand. This is definitely different from the way of inspiration of "leisurely seeing the Southern Mountains" or "mournfully chanting the decline." This is the violent advance of the internal life force of human beings, reflecting the turbulent external world. As Taine said, it is a stubborn and powerful force. Not only is it hidden in the individual's subconscious, but it is also influenced by the times and race. "The force influenced by this situation is passed down through generations and is constantly subjected to subjugation and edification." Turning to ancient history, there are many such facts. The Spanish crusade against Muhammad, the expulsion of the Moors, the looting of the Jews, the establishment of the Inquisition, and the Catholic wars are all examples. Externally, they manifest as bloody resistance, devout pursuit, political organization, and military training. Reflected in literature, they are filled with complex and soul-stirring prayers and rejections, the spiritual tendencies passed down through generations, the subconscious of one's own consciousness, and a chaotic state of mind that mixes external and internal events. This is no different from a miniature shadow of a turbulent era. A literary person experiencing a turbulent year gains the experience of ten years of peaceful living. Du Fu's "poem history" poems written on the road from the bandit camp to Fengxiang, Wen Tianxiang's "Guide Record," and Gorky's "The Forties," one of which is "Prairie Fire," all fully express the turbulent life of a short period. In a tense lifestyle, their interlacing and continuity are gathered within a relatively short period of time and are extremely unpredictable.</p>
<p>A magnificent and splendid picture unfolds before us, and like driving on a mountain road, we are overwhelmed. Encountering such an unprecedentedly tense life, if we are not careful, our eyes will be confused by the excessively dazzling colors and jarring sounds. In this dangerous but also flat, ugly but also beautiful circle, we must immerse ourselves in the hills and valleys to share, and also lift the painting of "life" and transform it into contemplation. You strive for light and fight for torches, not regretting burning your arms, but what good is it if you only burn your arms? In addition to feeling the temporary pain, you must also hold the blazing torch high and, after experiencing the tension, be able to observe the tension from a distance, making judgments and carrying out transformations.</p>
<h3>Four Hundred Miles of Journey—A War Zone Memoir—</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>The matter was truly unexpected. After less than half a year of mountain life, driven by a certain mission, I had to embark on a journey again. "Let me temporarily say goodbye to my newly acquainted friends!" On the eve of departure, I was indeed a little sad. Since joining the embrace of the Dabie Mountains, everything has felt fresh and pleasant. Although the material conditions cannot satisfy people, this winding and majestic world contains an active life, infinite power, and a bright future. Perhaps no one is willing to lightly abandon its caress?</p>
<p>On the morning of a day in late September, I finally set off. It was drizzling, and the mountains were swallowed up in clouds and mist. Only wisps of white smoke emerged from the deep ravines, indicating that the rural villages were still preparing breakfast. Thanks to Feng Xiaozhong's kindness, he hired a guide for me. So, I crossed the Shaxi River in the western suburbs and headed towards Fuziling. At this time, the route to Henan had already been cut off, so I had to take the road to Macheng in Hubei, planning to walk 40 li each day and arrive in Wuchang by the beginning of next month, and then take a car to Hunan. However, the war was happening in Songbu, so whether I could pass through the front lines was the current difficulty. "To complete the mission, how can I worry?" I encouraged myself.</p>
<p>In the late autumn season, the days are particularly short, as if urging pedestrians not to waste time. I had just arrived at Dingjiabu, and it was already noon. This is the leading town of Li Huang, with more than a hundred neat houses lining the wide streets, and the sounds of cars and horses were constant. It was very prosperous. However, this was the state a month ago. Now, what appeared before my eyes was a scene of broken walls and rubble. "Damn it, it was bombed like this!" the guide said, sounding surprised and angry.</p>
<p>"Don't be angry! They will recreate it!" I couldn't help but comfort him.</p>
<p>We stopped at Niushifan for lunch. The rain had not stopped, and it was already dusk. Strangely, I couldn't find any civilians in the town. Only a few monks lived in the dilapidated temple at the end of the street. Fortunately, the "Buddhist disciples" were compassionate, otherwise, we would have been helpless in terms of lighting a fire, boiling water, and cooking.</p>
<p>After the long night passed, we continued our journey, passing through Liji, Xiaohe, and reaching Banzhuyuan. Coincidentally, the Guangxi Youth Battlefield Service Group was also passing through here, which broke the loneliness of the journey. If I hadn't talked to the team leader, Miss Huang, I wouldn't have known she was a young girl. She had a strong physique, a resolute spirit, and moving words.</p>
<p>"I heard that Songbu has already started fighting...?" I asked.</p>
<p>She seemed to hesitate for a moment, shook her head, and said, "It shouldn't be that fast, right?" Then, she asked me why I wanted to leave the Dabie Mountains and what the purpose of going to Changsha was, as if she were interrogating a spy. Later, I learned that she was from Nanping County in Guangxi and had studied at Guida University. Since the outbreak of the war, her eldest brother had voluntarily joined the army and had been martyred in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Traveling west from Banzhuyuan, passing Changling Pass, the weather had just cleared up, but the temperature suddenly dropped. The northwest wind, like scissors, swept in from all directions, testing whether people's enthusiasm had also fallen. Especially when wading through mountain streams, the cold, piercing water often made you want to stop. However, we finally overcame the natural environment and quickly arrived at Liumihe.</p>
<p>"Songbu was tragically bombed..." This was on the wall newspapers in the town, and passersby were discussing it with angry faces.</p>
<h3>Wandering on the Streets</h3>
<p>— Lu Jiang</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Wandering on the street, looking at the floating clouds in the sky, the wind blowing gently.</p>
<p>Brushing aside the short hair on my forehead, I lowered my head again to stare at my black shoes, which were covered in dust, and pressed my hand on the only five-yuan bill left in my pocket - my heart felt heavy.</p>
<p>A familiar smile was cast from over there; and so, with light and quick steps - my hand was gently and warmly held.</p>
<p>"Friend! How are you? Which school are you teaching at?" What a bright tone, but the heart of the person being asked began to ache.</p>
<p>"Me? Unemployed!" I gave her a helpless bitter smile, followed by a slight sigh.</p>
<p>She was stunned, staring at my disappointed face, for a long time - I could still vaguely remember her smart and blessed eyes in the past! But now...</p>
<p>"Do I look pitiful? What do you see?" I asked with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"? " The answer was my friend's gaze, doubtful and yet sympathetic.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Who would believe that, with the help of a teacher, I had barely managed to get a job for only five months, before being replaced by someone else.</p>
<p>I have a bit of a stubborn personality, and I don't like to ingratiate myself with others. Maybe that offended my "superior"? Although I asked myself if I had been negligent at all in my educational duties, "trembling with fear, as if walking on thin ice." But what I got was a "dismissal without reason."</p>
<p>It was a humiliation. The heart of a young child was stabbed. She began to understand the difficulty of living on a solitary island by one's own strength.</p>
<p>I remembered the kind words of the children at parting: "Teacher! Come back after the summer vacation." Then, they handed me a few white orchids. At the moment of parting, I lived in the fragrant air of white orchids. This fully conveyed the friendship that the children had given her for half a year.</p>
<p>And now? The kind voices of the children often linger in my ears. The warmth of the children's friendship often and uncontrollably welled up from my painful heart!</p>
<p>Imagining the contempt of others (forgetting that some people would also sympathize with her), I was also embarrassed to live with my relatives, and even more afraid to go to the teacher who had helped me to tell him: "I am unemployed!"</p>
<p>I made up a good lie: "The school doesn't allow accommodation." - So I stayed at my relatives' house, but wandered on the streets every day. When I was hungry, I went to a restaurant, spending a few dimes. But could this kind of life continue? A five-yuan bill, how many days could it last? This long string of days? Vague.</p>
<p>"Go home!" But I was alone, with nothing to my name...! My home was also under the trampling of iron hooves. Young people are not used to hibernating.</p>
<p>What to do? Wandering back and forth on the streets like this... My heart was filled with the bitter meaning of a wanderer.</p>
<p>A thousand and one knots tied together? How can they be untied?? Ah!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The wind blew softly, and the crowds coming and going all wore smiles on their faces. So I looked at the sky, but this time I didn't sigh, but walked even more stubbornly, never wanting to give in.</p>
<h3>Night Talk</h3>
<p>— Shen Yu-gang</p>
<p>"For a long time, I've wanted to be a sailor, to go to sea and seek my fortune. Ten or twenty years later, I'll bring back a tanned face to my homeland."</p>
<p>"So, you're a son of the sea."</p>
<p>"The job of lighthouse keeper once bewildered me. But, on a night as starry as tonight, I suddenly realized that that's what old people do: pointing out lost ways. People our age should be wrestling with the ocean. Did you know? Seawater comes in all sorts of colors. What I love is a black wave, crashing against the hull but spitting out white foam. Those are days of big tides. Only living on a boat can you understand the meaning of life. But, no need to cite classics, saying something about Mount Tai and a feather."</p>
<p>"Your words have piqued my interest."</p>
<p>"Are you going to convert to the sea too, to be my brother?"</p>
<p>"No, I mean you've piqued my interest in speaking. I prefer to be a hunter. That alertness fascinates me."</p>
<p>"You love something mysterious."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. I'm just saying I've had that thought. Take a gun, a bag of gunpowder, and my favorite deerskin boots. Building my luck with ambition, the misfortune of animals."</p>
<p>"That's not fair."</p>
<p>"Are you a humanitarian? Haha. The best season for hunting isn't sunny days. I love the snowy winters, the mountains and fields all white. Ah, but tomorrow I'm setting off, going into the mountains to shoulder my gun."</p>
<p>"Are you going to hunt a deer to make boots?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm going into the mountains to hunt wolves."</p>
<h3>The Birth of Jesus and Society</h3>
<p>The world was in darkness, and Jesus was the true light of the world. All those who lived in darkness and shadow saw the true light and were revived. The world was a dry land, and Jesus was the sweet dew of life. All who believed in him would receive the water of life and nourish their parched hearts. The world was in the midst of war and turmoil, and Jesus was the gospel of peace. When this sound entered a grieving heart, it would receive life and peace. In short, the birth of Jesus was the manifestation of God's great love, providing for all the proper needs of people's hearts. This Jesus was the "crystallization of God's love" and a noble and unparalleled gift. Looking at what Jesus gave to people from all walks of life at that time, and the admiration of people from all walks of life for Jesus, proves the correctness of the above words. (1) (To give rest to those who are weary) The shepherds in the wilderness are representatives of the working class. Under the rule of the ruling class, they were exploited of their precious sweat, blood, and time, and had no guarantee of a peaceful old age. They suffered all their lives and never had a chance to rise. Just as they were sighing in despair, they suddenly remembered the prophet's prophecy, which seemed to say, "When that day comes in the future, the afflicted will be rescued, and the laborers will surely be comforted." But when can we see it? It's still a long way off! Unexpectedly, in the night shrouded in darkness, they suddenly saw a strange light from heaven. In a state of panic, they heard the angel delivering the gospel saying, "Do not be afraid, your Savior is born tonight!" They heard Jesus' call saying, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." Because of Jesus, these gracious words have all become the way of life. (2) (To give the gospel to the poor) Please listen to Mary's song: My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed...The Mighty One has done great things for me, holy is his name. His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation...He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty. (Omitted below) To realize this ideal, Jesus must first be a poor man himself. He was not born in high-rise buildings, but in a stable and cowshed. Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but Jesus had nowhere to lay his head. He was extremely rich, but he became poor for our sake, calling believers to be spiritually rich because of his poverty. He is a poor man who makes people rich. Our poor lives and poor society are in need of the gospel, without peace, without harmony, without love, with hatred, with greed, and with selfishness, which is a great spiritual poverty, and the world is full of it. If we accept Jesus, we will surely become rich because of his love and cross. (If you want to study in detail, please send a letter to P.O. Box 1227)</p>

<h3>Chaplin No. 6: Script Approved, Content Secret, Jokes and Dances Extraordinarily Rich</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>After completing his epic film "The Great Dictator," the comedian Chaplin originally intended to retire. Unexpectedly, he is enthusiastic. According to news from Chaplin's office at United Artists in Hollywood, the comedian is preparing to shoot another epic satire of Hitler, tentatively titled "Chaplin No. 6."</p>
<p>The script for this film has been approved, but the content is kept strictly secret, fearing that some people might be offended. What is known is that there are six Chaplins in the film, all playing dictators. Chaplin himself plays two roles: the dictator and a Jewish barber, who shaves the beard of another dictator. Chaplin's brother, named Sydney, plays the dictator's twin brother, along with three old partners.</p>
<p>In addition to the six Chaplins, Paulette Goddard, whom he once loved, plays a poor washerwoman, just like in "Modern Times." Also, Mr. Towneville plays Goering, Hitler's right-hand man, making the cast more impressive than ever. In the film, Chaplin also invents a special "Broken Boots" salute and new dances and songs.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the sales, because since the European war, American films have had significantly reduced outlets in countries such as England, France, and Poland. The only solution is to find other markets. Chaplin's films were previously very popular in Russia, but since the Soviet Union has recently shaken hands with Germany, whether the comedian's satire of the German leader will be banned is also a question.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Chaplin once stood up to defend himself, saying that the international situation is ever-changing. By the time my film is completed, the Soviet Union will no longer be aligned with Germany. My work will definitely not encounter any obstacles, it can be predicted.</p>
<h3>MGM to Film "Chinese Water Margin"</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>China has become the best place for Hollywood filmmakers to gather script material. In recent years, there have been several films with China as the theme or background. Warner Oland's "Shanghai Madness," which was shown in China last year, created unprecedented box office records when it opened in New York. This naturally attracted great attention from MGM. Therefore, "The Good Earth," which they had spent more than two years producing at home and abroad, was quickly completed. Although the box office was not as successful as "Shanghai Madness," it still made a profit of over a million US dollars. Now, the owner of MGM has officially announced that after "The Good Earth," they will decide to adapt Pearl S. Buck's translation of "All Men Are Brothers" (Chinese Water Margin) for the screen, with a production budget of four million US dollars. As for location shooting, given the special circumstances in China, it has been decided not to film in China again.</p>
<p>As for the 108 heroes needed for "Chinese Water Margin," MGM believes that it is impossible to find so many male stars to play the roles, and that having too many people would diminish the interest in the plot. Therefore, it has been decided that there will be no more than thirty-five characters. Currently, because the original translator, Pearl S. Buck, is still recovering in London and has refused to help with the production, MGM is preparing to hire a famous Chinese professor in New York to serve as a special advisor for "Chinese Water Margin." They are currently looking for someone. At the same time, MGM is also preparing to ask the Chinese government to send personnel to Hollywood as consultants and observers.</p>
<p>The director of the film has been selected as Fred Zinnemann, and the main actors have been tentatively set as Paul Muni, Wallace Beery, William Wellman, Stuart Erwin, Luise Rainer, Una Merkel, and C. Aubrey Smith, among others. Chinese actors include the American-trained dramatist Zhu Jun and Miss Yang Zhu, who appeared in "The Good Earth."</p>
<p>We hope that MGM's production of this film about the great spirit of Chinese national heroes, with millions of US dollars, will at least not violate the wishes of the Chinese people. Distortions such as Chinese people with bound feet and queues must absolutely not be found in "Chinese Water Margin."</p>
<h3>"China Travel Troupe" Revives, First Play is "Resurrection"</h3>
<p>After "China Travel Troupe" signed a contract with the Xuan Palace recently, Tang Huaiqiu wrote to Hong Kong to recruit old members to return, such as Ge Xin and Li Jingbo, who have now arrived in Shanghai. At the same time, he asked friends to invite Shanghai drama and film actors to join as guest performers, such as Liu Qiong, Yan Fei, Tu Guangqi, and Ding Zhi and their wives, all of whom have agreed to join the special lineup of "China Travel Troupe."</p>
<p>The first play to meet the audience is "Resurrection," but this is a charity performance at the request of the Shanghai Refugee Association, starting on the 24th and running for five days. As for the official premiere, it is scheduled for New Year's Eve this year, with the play "Empress Dowager" by Wei Ruhui.</p>
<h3>Veteran Actress Mary Pickford Recovers from Fall</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>American veteran actress Mary Pickford, the ex-wife of the late Douglas Fairbanks, has been traveling in England with her new husband, Charles Rogers, for two months. Recently, they were traveling in Scotland and were injured in a car accident in a certain place. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious, and after two weeks of recuperation in the hospital, she has fully recovered. Note: Charles Rogers was a handsome young actor from the early sound film era, who co-starred with Mary Pickford in the film "Kiki." The two fell in love at first sight and declared their love and cohabitation.</p>
<h3>Rambling about "The Gay Divorcee"</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert's acting skills in "It Happened One Night" showed extreme brilliance. Following that, her performance in "The Eighth Wife" was particularly excellent, fully demonstrating her comedic talent and promising unlimited prospects. MGM director giant Van Dyke II, how could he let go of this type of talent, specially hired her to star in "The Gay Divorcee," creating a new style in the 1934 comedy films.</p>
<p>The entire film is linked by clever jokes, from the encounter with beauty in the suburbs to the final revelation, every moment of progress, every performance, is full of humorous language and funny actions. In particular, the woman's relentless pursuit, following east and west, and the man's desperate escape, unwilling to be a pink prisoner. Colbert vividly portrays a passionate female poet, every move making people smile and unable to help but laugh. Stewart's private detective shows a foolish appearance, which is particularly ingenious, without a moment of calm, without a moment of slowness, the entire film progresses in high-speed jokes.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is when Stewart has pursuers in front and no way out, he puts on a pair of deep nearsighted glasses, pretending to be a Boy Scout coach, staggering and stumbling, like a blind man riding a blind horse, bumping around everywhere. Thanks to Colbert's support, he escaped the encirclement. This kind of performance is truly the height of slapstick comedy, and everyone will laugh until their stomachs hurt.</p>
