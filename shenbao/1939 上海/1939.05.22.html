<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c8">期望於今日之國聯行政院常會 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>國際聯盟會行政院第一〇五次常會、今日開會於日內瓦。據頻日電傳，本居常會議程之中，政治性質之議案凡二：一爲芬蘭國埃倫特島設防問題，一爲中國關於抗戰之提案。此外，無關本屆會議，祗因各國外交代表聚集日內瓦之便，交換意見，，甚或進行談判者，的有重要者三事：一，英法蘇三國締結盟的，組織反侵略集團問題；二，但澤自由市問題；三，修改國聯盟的，改組國聯問題。</p>
<p>國際聯盟嘗爲國際之重心，雖自始以美國之未經參加而有其先天之缺憾，及蘇聯入會，聲勢爲之一振。爾後，日本以武力侵略中國，國聯未能秉公援用盟的；義國遠征阿比西尼亞。國聯發動崎形之制裁而無效；日本義大利德意志諸國，復相繼宣告脫離國聯；於是國聯之威望令譽、漸見式微，幾乎不復爲國際重心，雖然，此猶國際最大之集團，功能儘可懐疑，的章煌煌存在也。信乎人類之智慧與行動，人事之發展與進步，必不免於類乎波之折，而未可遽期以直如矢；則所以創造國際之光明，維繫國際之秩序者，與其希望以捨棄國聯，革故鼎新，另起爐竈，猶母寗希望以就國聯而振飭之，充實之，以底於健全。即以美國而論，若始終爲孤立理論所磨阻，視新大陸爲別有洞天，而以爲萬魔不入，竟得獨善其身，則亦已矣；不然，美國雖以至富至强，舉足重輕，旣儼然爲兩半球之盟主，顧一朝決計預聞世界的國際組織，當然不致別求基礎於國聯之外。或以國聯之頻年頓挫，薄之如告朔之餼羊，其實未然；國聯者，固猶五官齊整，性靈卓犖，而血氣未充，本能未健，是文明人羣之宗子也。而當世會員國家之於國聯，。珍重之，愛護之，扶掖之，而冀以德業日進，强健有爲，及早克勝所負荷；是在目前，視本能所及，能一事，做一事，能三五事，做三五事。至於美國之於國聯，固痛癢相關，休戚攸共之道義交也。惟其然，吾人掬誠厚望於其今日行政院常會，奮發砥礪、有偉大之表見，偉大之成就！以表見與成就之偉大，期待於今日國聯行政院之常會，母乃太奢？蓋國聯雖有其世界性，實以歐洲爲重，會內大柄，操於英法；方今歐陸危機四伏，勢未能有何作爲，此其一；盟的所規定，有漠視者，有畏懼者，有反對者，如何可望遽振綱紀，此其二；歷來提而未議，議而未決，決而未行者，不勝屈指，更何論別有創作，此其三。昨報刋載路透社日內瓦電，有云「但澤問題未列入議程，蓋衆覺目前處理此種具爆炸性之問題，殊屬不合時宜；」寥寥數語，可證奢望之無益矣。</p>
<p>顧有不應作如是想，未可作如是觀者。國聯威望令譽之漸决式微，半由自召，半由環境；及至今日，國際情勢，政家認識，以屢决痛切之試騐，痛切之敎訓，舉非復昔比矣。爲述一端：國聯盟的，始終如一；然往年國際尙退讓，尙妥協，尙綏靖，而今則努力於組織反侵略集團惟恐不及；試作衡量，往年國際動態與盟的近乎？目前國際動態與盟的近乎？然則何得以往年國聯之未能有爲而遽小覷之於今日與今後。更就國聯之環境言之，往年讐視國聯者，飛揚跋扈，氣燄萬丈，今則趨於衰竭矣；往年美國輒與國聯之表示，在外交上保持平行，今則美國與國聯之主要會員國，在行動上已開始一致；然則國聯不應適應環境而更自磨厲乎？夫如此云云者，絕非身居遠東而作片面癡願，路透社十八日倫敦電謂：</p>
<p>『國聯同志會會長薛西爾勳爵。前任印度决官史尼爾勳爵。及上院工黨議員李斯吐威爾勳爵等所組織之代表團，將於明日訪晤外相哈立法克斯，促請英政府在日內瓦儘力運動國聯採取積極行動以助中國。』</p>
<p>又哈瓦斯社二十日倫敦電謂：</p>
<p>『英國援華運動會頃特發表宣言，要求國聯會大會舉行政院歷次所通過之決議案，卽主張各會員國個別援助中國之決議案，應卽付　實施一。其法不外下開三端：（一）拒不以作戰用品供給日本。其中飛機一項，尤應禁止輸往該國。（二）抵制日本貨物，俾在短時期之內，以重大打擊加諸該國經濟甚礎。（三）在金融上與經濟上援助中國，俾克建設西南各省，發展工業合作運動，救濟戰區難民。以上各種行動，應由行政院設立委員會，加以調整，以提高其效率。邇來國聯會某某會員國政府，均曾宣佈願擁護集體安全制，國聯會行政院誠能援助中國，卽係對於集體安全制之莫大的貢獻。又况美國亦願積極參加援華工作，此於羅斯福總統近頃言行可以見之。』</p>

<p>內蒙情况、匪特未可樂觀、實較日軍侵入前狀况為惡劣、往昔歸化繁榮所繫之興盛的輸出商業、今已全歸停頓、推究其故、因自甘肅及新疆西南部起之商隊大道、完全阻斷、華軍陣綫、僅在平綏路終站包頭迤西不數哩處、曩時駱駝列成長行循該古代之商隊道路、緩然而行、每小時輒為一哩半、用以載運皮革羊毛、及遠西之其他產物、獲利甚豐之載運雅片商隊、且置勿談、凡此種種、均已停止、今無商隊行抵包頭或歸化、其次、北部蒙古平原中、</p>

<h3 id="c58">法律與經濟的聯繫 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 裘英</p>
<p>近代人類，以經濟力來建設國家富强與市面繁榮。雖半由自然趨勢，然亦賴有法律的完備，而有此突飛的進步。假如一個國家的經濟結搆，無法律為之支持。則彷彿似失了舵的船，就不能航行，而達到彼岸。反一面言之，如法律離開經濟，殊也無創設之必要。相互為因，相互為果，兩者實含有不可分的聯繁作用。</p>
<p>歐美經濟，早巳踏上了資本主義的道路。直到現在，已臻於登峰造極。因此歐美國家，純為着與這經濟制度相配合，造出許多財產法規和保護財產法規來，謀貿易安全與資產發展。表國為要順應潮流起見，不能不迎頭趕上，力圖自新。可是因種種的關係，其在經濟一面，祇限於沿海商埠及幾處都市，約具規模，然亦偏於消費。至於生產一道，尙屬幼穉。其他鄉鎭各地，仍保持着我國固有生活，無近代經濟可言。</p>
<p>明乎此。須知我國的民商法規，雖仿自歐美，但考自我國的經濟，不逮遠甚。因此行諸實際，難免有『婢學夫』之誚，且亦有顧此失彼之虞。蓋緣我國受外來經濟的壓迫，基礎異常薄弱，雖有新興工業，剛剛走在資本主義的前門，未有登堂入室。茍法律的內容，過於資本化，則勞苦大衆的福利，必剝削殆盡，更日趨於窮化，實為我國隱憂。今舉例以言之，如俞鍾駱君所慮的『加租問題』，宗孟君的『情法失平之弊』，在在都關乎上海的民生。雖則目前的上海，因各處避難來滬的居民，日益增多，自較平時的情形特殊。但是貧民的住宅問題，遇到了產主的壓迫，竟不能為合法的解決，可見法律與經濟不配合的因素，已表現無遺。要知歐美各國，其房價騰貴，由於工商業的發達，以政人口聚集，生活上升。而上海的居民，却由各處避難來此，非但資金告乏，而且大都失業，借貸無門。其日常生活，較平時為難，目都下降。而一般富者，祇顧自己有利可圖，無不藉了資本化的法律，向貧民進攻。雖則關乎道德，然亦理直氣壯。若論人情，誰肯慷自已之慨，以作此利益顛倒的笨伯。所謂上海環境特殊，可說無不特殊。一方面貧民儘管自殺，一方面二房客還自壓迫三房客，其他方面的奸商，還自囤積居奇的高抬米價。黃金萬惡，極盡了人間慘酷的能事—。今俞君鍾駱，欲藉社會與論，來誅伐富者的不仁。此雖能濟法律之窮，但是還須視其品性而定，惟善人能受盡言。否則倒行逆施，一意孤行，終難潛移默化。今為急則治標，莫若訴諸當道。苟能迅速頒布一種救濟法規，為一般貧民生活保障。他方面還須仰賴賢明法官，得能於每一訟案內，顧到一般經濟。使多數貧民，不窒息於生活困頓之下，惠莫大焉。</p>
<p>復次，一般民衆，得能以羣眾的意識，從事組織，促使現代法律，臻於大衆化。於是以『建國必』的經濟改進，完成其全民法律。總使無扞格之弊，并亦能符合人情之旨，裨益民生，庶不遠矣。然邪否邪，還希立法當局，注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c59">調解案件應不失簡易訴訟程序之精神 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 徐佐良</p>
<p>讀上週本刋瞿鉞君調解如何收實效一文，對於希望法院改善調解辦法，旣周且詳，余認為尙有補充之處者，即調解案件進而至訴訟時，應不失簡易訴訟程序之精神是也。查民訴法有簡易訴訟程序與非簡易訴訟程序（即地方案件）之規定，非簡易事件，言詞辯論期日，傳票之送達至少應有十日，就審期間，（民訴法二五一條）簡易事件則縮短至五日，而判決書內之事實及理由，得僅載其要領，（民訴法四二七·四三二條）足徵立法意旨，簡易事件力求簡速結案，以利訴民。至關於起訴前應請法院調解規定，（民訴法四〇九）其旨亦在簡速，故調解成立者與訴訟上和解有同一之效力，（民訴法四二一）並非認此較地方事件為鄭重。以地方事案件無容經過調解，而簡易事件，反須經此强制調解也。且查民訴法四〇九條一項五款，就法律關係之性質及當事人之狀况，可認為調解顯無成立之望者，得不經調解逕行起訴，又民訴法四一九條，調解當事人兩造到塲，調解不成立者，得依一造之聲請，為訴訟之辯論，尤足微調解案件，雖須經法院調解，然遇特種情事之下，仍得不為調解之聲請，而兩造到塲，調解不成立者，即得為訴訟之辯論，則是不失簡易程序簡速結案之糖神，更屬顯著。茲查上海第二特區地方法院，對於簡易事件，竟不問當事人有無因特種情事顯無調解成立之望之聲明，而逕行起訴者，一律由法院强制調解，聲請人到塲者，賣令補繳調解聲請費一元五角。（聲請人不到塲可以倖免）如調解不成立，再由法院分案定期傳審，迨至判決及執行，計算期間，自投狀至傳案調解，需時二星期，由調解不成立，至分案傳審，常需一個月，再由判詞送達至確定執行，尤需時二個月。大凡一簡易事件，自投狀迄於執行，計時常需三四個月以上，（指第一審確定者言）較諸地方事件結案之繁重，實有過之無不及。按厥原因，實緣一特法院對辦理簡易事件，關於應行調解之處，則適用民訴法四〇九條强制的規定。而關於得不經調解逕行起訴，及兩造到塲得為訴訟辯論之點，恒不適用民訴法四〇九條一項五款及四一九條之規定。以致實際上案件之繁簡及迅緩，竟與地方事件得相反之結果，一似互易地位，是豈立法初旨所能逆料哉。識者謂二特法院所以不問當事人有無調解成立之望之聲請，須一律强制調解，實緣法院法收較少，故不得不出此以圖救濟。而對於兩造當事人到塲竟不予訴訟辯論，乃以承辦調解推事與承辦訴訟推事，分作二起，故須另行分案云云，然此亦非無糾正之途。如果因法收而為强制調解，則法院儘可令收狀處對於未經調解逕行起訴者，投狀時加徵調解聲請費一元五角，將調解與訴訟審理一併分配，同一推事，同時分別為之。至遇兩造到塲，由一造聲請為訴訟辯論時，亦可由承辦推事逕行為訴訟之審理。如認為有審理時間關係，姑不妨將調解事項之分配加多庭員，减少案件，以資救濟。如是，庶於簡易事件，不失簡易訴訟程序之精神，對於民訴法四〇九條一項五款及四一九條之規定，不致再有故為出入不適用之虞，是所望於富局有以改善而糾正之。</p>
<p>裁判輯要</p>
<p>（最高法院上海特區分庭）</p>
<p>法院核對筆跡，巳足為判決時，即以其所得心證，據為判斷，雖未予實施鑑定程序，亦不得指為不合。（民二十七年度滬上字第一〇八號）</p>
<p>一，上訴狀內未表明上訴理由者，上訴人應於提起上訴發十五日內提出理由書於原第一一審法院，未提出者，法院毋‘庸命其補正。二，上訴人有律師為訴訟代理人，或依書狀上之記載可認其明知上訴要件有欠缺者，法院相不行民事訴訟法第四三九條第二項及第四四一條第一項但書之程序。（民二十七年度滬上字第一〇九號</p>
<p>當事人發見未經斟酌之證物或得使用該證物者，以如經斟酌可受較有利益之裁判為限，固得以再審之訴對於確定終局判決聲明不服。惟此所謂證物，係指前程序事實審言詞辯論終結前，業已存在之證物而言。（民二十七年度滬上字第一一五號）</p>

<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（問）甲有女孩於三歲時，經乙介紹給丙領養，甲病故後，丙與女約不與甲家往來，請問可向其交涉否？（漢升）</p>
<p>（答）甲女旣經丙收養，與甲家巳無親屬關係，自不得强其往來。（馮美學）</p>
<p>（問）離婚據載明小孩歸女方扶養，並註明敎育等費，均包括在膽養費中，嗣後男方責任是否終了？假使本人不要此孩，有何辦法？（陸人傑）</p>
<p>（答）富事人間旣有約定，自應依約辦理。惟父子有血親關係，依法不能脫離，如一方不能維持生活，又無謀生能力時，他方仍應負扶養責任。（馮美學）</p>
<p>（問）某女士早喪父母，由其親戚代為訂婚，但未經女士允許，未知法律上是否有效？（羅新）</p>
<p>（答）依法無效。但經女士追認者不在此限。（馮美學）</p>
<p>（問）甲於二十五年向乙借款五千元，以租界土地房屋作抵，立有押據，據內訂明「兩年為期，到期不還，任憑某某（即乙方）標賣，無庸經法院手續』字樣，現甲到期不還，乙方可否理行登報標賣，此種特約是否有效，（定宇）</p>

<p>— 俞鍾駱</p>
<p>舊刑事訴訟法第三百三十七條，規定被害人得自向該管法院起訴，與新邢事訴訟法第三百十一條，所謂被害人得提起自訴，皆所以示自訴權之主體為犯罪之被害人。惟舊法未設被害人須有行為能力之限制，而新法附以但書，故依比較解釋之結果，舊法被害人，如為無行為能力人，或限制行為能力，其自訴權之行使，均得由其法定代理人行之。（即以被害人之名義為自訴人，而由法定代理人代為訴訟行為，）新法被窖人苟無行為能力，即不認其為自訴權之主體，從而無法定代理人代為自訴之可言。又依蔔法第三百三十八條之所示。得為自訴人者，除被害人外，尙有左列之人</p>
<p>一，被害人之法定代理人保佐人，配偶。</p>
<p>二，被害人之親屬。有（一）之身分者，其以自己之名義，提起自訴，且不為被害人之意思所拘束，所謂獨立自訴是也。有（二）之身分者，僅於被害人已死亡後，得提自訴，惟不得與被害人明示之意思相反。尋繹立法意旨，蓋以有（一）之身分者，於公訴本許其獨立告訴，（舊法二一四條一項）於自訴亦以許其獨立自訴為宜。其有（二）之身分者，許於被害人已死亡後，不違反被害人明示之意思，以行告訴，亦為與舊法第二百十四條第二項互為應合之規定，皆所以求被害人利益保護周至。新法號稱擴張自訴之範圍，乃於自訴權之主體嚴格限制，必須由有行為能力之被害人行使，旣不許由其法定代理人代行自訴，又將舊法獨立自訴，及親屬於被害人死亡後，不背其明示之意思而為之自訴等規定，一併刪除，則雖屬告訴乃論之犯罪，其被害人如非具有民法上之行為能力，亦不能由其本人之法定代理人自訴，而必依公訴程序為告訴，方能經檢察官之偵查起訴，是得為自訴之範圍，雖經放寬，而被害人得利用自訴程序以求保護之機會，反較舊法為狹，寗非立法者之矛盾。將謂限制被害人以外之人為自訴，在防濫詐敲訴之弊，則何以解於公訴程序，仍設獨立告訴，及被害人死亡後，寬其行告訴者之規定，立法者之精神，未能一貫，尤為顯著，</p>
<p>上所述者，僅就自然人之被害者言也。進而論及法人；依現行民法第二十六條，雖謂其於法令限制內，有享受權利負担義務之能力，而未明示其有行為能力，刑事訴訟法更未如民事訴訟法設有「能獨立平法律行為負義務者有訴訟能力」之相同規定，自不認法人有行為能力，旣無行為能力，則法人因犯罪而為被害人時，應依新刑事訴訟法第三百十一條但書之限制，應不許為自訴，又因新法未如舊法，設有法定代理人獨立自訴之相同規定，其法人之代表人，亦應同解為無自訴之權。然助新刑事訴訟第三百十一條所謂被害人，將以自然人為限矣。乃查司法院之解釋，則以明示法人為被害人時，得由其代表人提起自訴，並仍維待其在舊形事訴訟法適用時所為「自訴人以自然人或法人」為限之陳義，或亦感於新法之限制失當，而不得不藉此司法上之解釋，勉圖適用上之救濟歟？茲附係此問題之新舊兩解繹號數年月日於後，用便參考。</p>

<p>有許多男女於結婚之後，全都變了。這種變當然有好壞兩方面：在好的方面，例如一個婚前懶散的男子，於婚後會變得非常的勤儉，身體瘦弱者也有變為健康的了。在壞的方面，每有於婚前為一個英俊奮發的青年，可是婚後會頓然的變為頹廢了，强壯者變為衰弱了，甚至在肉體和精神上發現着種種病態，可以和以前完全判若兩人。這是什麼緣故呢？就是夫婦生活影響於身體和精神的所致。</p>
<p>快樂，是我們精神上的食糧，足以鼓舞我們奮發前進。健康，是我們肉體的動力，它支持着我們終日的工作。可是健全的精神寓於健全的體格，兩者又息息相關，不可分離。</p>
<p>一個精力充沛的健壯男子，娶了一個滿意的夫人，或是一個健美多姿的女郎，嫁了一個滿意的丈夫。他們必然在愛的氛圍裏，過着快樂的日子，生男育女，組織着美滿的家庭。因為身心上的得到相互歡慰，相互體量，相互珍惜，必然健康增進，精神愉快，前途充滿濟樂觀，樂觀則進取，進取則成功。可是一個丈夫如果患有早洩陽萎，滑精漏精，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，或是討了一個乳癟顏衰，經亂自帶的夫人，在他們的夫婦生活上必不能協調而臻美滿。我們知道，夫婦間的性生活美滿與否，實是維繫他們愛情的唯一要素。試想一個健美女郎嫁了一個病夫，那夫婦生活就無法美滿，把可寶貴的年華虛度，這是使她多麼痛心呢？因為她的不滿與不快，家庭間每演出種種悲劇！弄到後來，衰弱丈夫或是衰弱的妻子仍必自食其惡果！所以欲求夫婦生活的美滿，身體健康實為唯一要義。但已患有上述病態之丈夫，欲謀補救，在今日醫學昌明之世界，亦非難事。唯一治法，即服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素「，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，并助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，則上述各症即可根本痊愈。若能繼續服用，更可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，（五洲大藥房有售）以固精關，制止遺洩，則治標治本並用，收效必更迅速。據世界名醫之千萬病案，及余在國內外之多年經騐，均認此法治療上述各症，最為對症特效，故敢樂為介紹於病家。此點苦心，諒所共鑒！</p>

<h3 id="c66">乳峯萎癟的悲一哀！ <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>近接惇信路北石家宅沈女士來函，說她的身體本來不甚强健，更因在發育時常穿小馬甲，致胸前的一對乳峯，發育未臻美滿，雖不見得怎樣平坦，但僅有很小而微聳的兩個雛型。根本談不到高聳與富有彈性，因此出嫁以後，雖然她的面貌還長得相當美麗，可是總不能博得丈夫的歡心。最近三月，因小產後身體失健，致本來不甚高聳的乳房，愈加萎癟下去。平坦得一如男子，由是她丈夫對她益加冷淡，有時竟連夜不歸，她屢次加以婉勸，他丈夫只當耳邊風，她理直辭嚴的和他交涉。他要比她凶！她說別人家的丈夫對妻多麼恩愛？他說別人家的女人何以都是豐乳肥臀，肉感動人。妳怎會萎癟醜陋，一無動人之處。她被他氣得無語可答，天天涕淚洗面，自怨自艾！日前偶在昔年同學宋琦女士處看到現代醫學，始投函本刋編者詢問補救之法。</p>
<p>關於這樣的事情，現在社會上自然多得不堪，但此種缺陷，並非不能彌補。據世界著名婦科專家及余等經騐。均公認以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，最為對症而特效。蓋乳峯萎癟的主要原因。為生殖腺卵巢機能失健，如以少壯動物的卵巢精質所配製的女用『生殖素』服之。自然可以在短期內立著顯效。如繼續服用，不特可使萎癟的乳峯，日形高聳，同時且能調整月經，消滅子宮疾患，旺盛新陳代謝作用，增加活力，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>現在雖尙初夏，但倐忽之間，就會到炎夏的。當火傘高撐溽暑燻蒸的時候，如果患有遺精症乾，不特將症象惡化，遺精的次數加多，或竟由遺精失治而造成滑精漏精。所以遺精如能在初夏作澈底治療，則不特體內元氣少虧，在治療上亦較易為。這眞是合算的辦法</p>
<p>我人體內的精，實為我人生命源泉。不特它操縱了我人狀貌體重的發育，并能調整新陳代謝作用，滋養各部神經，若因遺精，滑精或漏精，而把精液流失過多。那凡腦衰健忘，失眠不安，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，精力渙散等症即相繼而來。同時發育機能停滯，新陳代謝作用減退。呈體貌不揚，局部短小，面黃肌瘦，未老先衰諸種病態，此種男子，若在炎夏，動輒腦脹頭痛，為學生者要想在暑假裏補習些功課，那麼能行？如此職業界的青年，每日為工作所壓迫，簡直有不能勝任之苦，弄得不好，在夏秋之交，疫癘橫行之際，竟有病鳴呼者，亦是常有的事。總之，此種青年，前途黯淡，幸福喪盡！欲謀補救，必須根本治療其疾病。遺精的特效療法。在此時只有服「希米脫氏固精片」，最為可靠。因此劑於服後即能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，使夜間夢幻減少，可得安眠，則遺精自愈。若因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，腲長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，則上述各症，必可於短期內完全霍然，并可使身體益增健康，收延年益壽之效。患者若能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療·注射·手術等多種對證療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>在於經騐的臨床家，對於淋毒這種毛病，必然努力爲病家根治至完全根治爲止，他决不放棄中途放棄神聖的責任，而使用霸烈的藥物，笨拙的手術，施行不正當之療法，使病情强制壓伏，致釀成後患。</p>
<p>例如在急性白濁時期，醫家因了要博到病家的信仰起見，使用强烈的洗滌法，或霸烈的藥物，結果暫覺排膿停止，尿液澄淸，或於小便時僅僅看到二三點淋系，此時醫家往往對病家説，你的病已完全好了，不必治療了，可是許多病家往往回家没有幾天，依然就要再發了。要知淋毒的病原菌，不僅繁殖於粘膜之全面，而且往往由粘膜的深入，或蔓延到鄰接的附屬器官，在此等部分內又重新搆成病灶。所以雖用强烈之洗滌藥，縱然僥倖把粘膜表面上的病象治好，而鄰接的各附屬器官，又復發作起來了。要知尿中有淋系固然是未根治，即肉眼看去尿液已經澄淸了，也不能斷定牠已治愈。</p>
<p>要避免上列各種弊端，只有使用德國濾淋平流電療法，及超特之化學療法兼用，才能迅速將淋菌撲滅，因濾淋平流電療具有廣泛而深入的强大殺菌力，並能澄淸其毒素，更齊之以超特療法，與敏捷無痛之手術，那麽因爲殺菌力既然十分透徹，而毒素更爲之澄淸，那末一經治愈，絶無再發之事。　診時：上午九時至午後六時止</p>

<p>日記者指為反日</p>
<p>字林報云、据同盟社東京消息稱、東京日日新聞係各報之駐滬訪員本月二十日致電東京、謂上海日員以為日本將被迫取單獨行動、以實行對公共租界政策之意見、漸見增强、該訪員預料駐滬日總領事三浦回抵滬任後、時局將有新發展、三一浦刻在東京、與外務省長官會商一切、本月二十七日可返抵滬埠、該訪員又謂星期五日上海商團與工部局警隊之動員、表面乃遏制·恐怖主義、其實為一種反日示威運動、此種局勢、與英美拒絕日本關於修正公共租界地皮章程之意見、皆使人感覺欲藉外交方法告成工部局之改組、至為困難、</p>

<p>滬甬綫復航以後、滬定綫已有問題、惟甬定綫則復航已告成功、大通社記者、茲探錄實况如左、</p>
<p>滬甬綫</p>
<p>滬甬綫禮和船務部謀福輪前日自滬駛甬成功後、中意康沙義輪、原定昨日開甬、該輪嗣以鑒於寗波被炸後、碼頭起卸貨物之小工、須晚間回城工作、故改於今晨四時開出、則傍晚可以抵甬、德平輪巳由溫啟駛來滬、今日可到、明日開甬、如時間不及、則展至二十四日早晨開出、</p>
<p>甬定綫</p>
<p>滬定綫自十九日遠東哈納輪與魯麟高登輪相繼駛定後、該兩輪均於二十日上午抵定、哈納輪已於昨日下午四時、載客裝貨離定、今日上午八時可抵滬　高登輪當日在定停泊一天、於昨晨八時首次復航寗波、途中甚為順利、於午後二時安抵甬埠、該輪定今日仍由甬開定、自是常川行駛甬定綫、</p>
<p>滬定線</p>
<p>據大通社記者接獲消息、哈納輪自定海開回上海後、即暫時停駛滬定綫、大致將改放溫州、關於停航原因、該輪當局未有表示、故滬定航運恢復未久、顯又將陷於停頓中矣、又外傳太古新北京輪、有於今日航甬之說、其實該輪現在天津、航甬之說、完全不確、</p>

<p>江浙春繭、開始上市、淪陷區域內之各城市由「華中公司「統制、各鄉鎭由上海各絲廠自由收繭、浙土種繭今年歉收、改良種行將登塲、預料較佳、滬市各廠、俟新繭運抵後、即行恢復開車、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>准許滬商鄉鎭收繭</p>
<p>「華中蠶絲公司一本擬統制江浙淪陷區域春繭、禁止上海各絲廠商收買、旋因各地游擊隊、奉令破壞各繭行、於是鑒於鄉鎭繭行統制困難、同時經上海各絲廠商之力爭、始允放棄鄉鎭繭行之統制、准許上海廠商自由收買、上海各廠商今日分別赴各鄉鎭設行收買、並備有上海絲廠業同業公會之證明文件、惟收得之繭、須向「維新政府」納稅、然後准許運滬、</p>
<p>土種歉收改良尙佳</p>
<p>浙江之杭州·海寗·嘉興·德清·各縣之土種繭、均已上市、杭州扯價每担（十八兩天平秤）為國幣四十二元、海寗之長安頭號土種繭每担為國幣四十五元、惟今年浙省各縣士種繭、因天氣關係、均告歉收約三成、至於改良種即將登塲、預料收成尙佳、因連日天氣很好、適宜於改良種上簇、聞江蘇無錦·蘇州·常州·丹陽·各地改良種、預定本月底邊或下月初登塲、</p>
<p>上海各廠待繭開車</p>
<p>上海租界內各絲廠、總約四十五家、前區原料缺乏、被迫相繼停工、至昨日截止、勉强維持開工者、僅怡和等數家而已、關於今年之向淪陷區收繭、雖銀錢業停放龜款、保險行停保各險、但為避免原料無着計、仍冒險向淪陷區域收買、今決俟新繭運抵滬後、即行恢復開車、並決定此後開日夜工趕繅、預料春繭上市後之上海絲廠、可增至五十餘家、</p>
<p>浙東春繭已准運滬</p>
<p>浙東紹興·蕭　山·新昌·嵊縣諸曁等縣、亦為唯一之產繭區域、今已完全上市、由當地廠商及餘繭商收買、浙江省地方銀行及油茶絲管理處、已撥款一百五十萬元、辦理春繭貸款、聞以上各縣所產之繭、均係士種、至於改良種、鮮有孵育、今年收成、則較浙西為佳、貿易委員會本擬予以統制運銷、今經上海廠商之要求、已允准許由甬裝輪運滬、</p>

<p>本市各大小電機織綢廠不下三四百家之多、茲據綢業界消息、現因各地產絲區被統制、原料運滬稀少、致存貨日行减少、售價亦見提高、除滬西大多數小型電機廠、因限於資本、無力營業、被迫停業外、並各大電機織綢廠所出品之綢貨、因原料昂貴、故將各種綢貨價格提高一二成不等、至於外埠銷路、以雲南·貴陽·四川·昆明·等地為大宗、惟因水脚昂貴、獲利頗鮮、</p>

<p>滬市米業市塲、遭受有資力之囤戶投機操縱結果、致市價狂漲、在十五元限價之外、復做暗盤、竟昇漲二三元、祇因買賣雙方、均秘密授受、是以執行取締、非常困難、放評價委員會之工作、窒得重重、特議決解散、昨晨上午九時、市塲開市後、買賣雙方、如醉如狂、大量交易原做暗盤市價、竟變為公開喊價、最高白粳於上半市漲至十八元一二角、迨至下半市、則稍微回跌、但其最高行市、仍至十七元七八角至十八元之間、一般囤戶、又見於銷胃激增、依然將上中號粳秈停止拋出、居奇抬價、</p>

<p>租界當局取締操縱</p>
<p>公共租界工部局·法租界公董局、對於滬市米糧調節與市價高漲、異常關切、凡直接與民食攸關之雜糧、均有詳細調查、認為滬地現有各棧存米存粉等食糧、足可維持六個月、即使在青黃不接時、亦無匱乏之虞、照目前米市塲之市價反常飛漲、增加市民負担、與影饗治安者、至為重大、顯然有投機之輩、操縱市塲、殊屬可惡、故兩當局業已飭令捕房派探每晨派駐市塲秘密調查、如一經查出、即嚴厲取締、並加重處罰、以儆效尤、</p>
<p>米糧來源設法疏通</p>

<p>— 周</p>
<p>——袁履登先生——</p>
<p>袁履登先生是由於幼年苦讀而成功的一個足資青年模範的人，中年服務社會，凡百公益，靡役不與。他生平得力於「知足不辱，」其志趣頗有陶靖節之風，就是飲酒，也大有「親友知其善飲，或置酒而招之」之槪，可是他並不是期在必醉而已。</p>
<p>當記者去訪問他的時候，袁先生正在難民協會手揮目送處理他的公務，他今年六十一歲，而精神瞿鑠，一件布長衫顯見得他習性樸素。在他座位後面，掛着一幀白首娛親圖，是紀念他一家的四世同堂，沈淇泉（術）太史等替他題上了詩說是「堂上歡欣堂下笑，果然子孝又孫賢。」</p>
<p>我們開始談到難民救濟事業的前途，他說：全上海市租界內現經收容的難民有五萬餘人，連南市難民區，當有十餘萬人，未經收容的街頭難民，和最近由各處避難來滬的，還無法統計。現在各界捐款，可稱踴躍，協會對於難民的生產和敎育，都在積極辦理：尤其注意於難民的善後問題，在相當時期內，可望得到一個切實的結果，使難民有了技術的能力，足以自食其力。當然這個切實的結果，還是必須各界始終盡力協助的。</p>
<p>他開始暢叙他個人的志趣和生活狀况，他說我是除了鴉片毒物以外，烟酒兩項，都是夙好的。但是十餘年來，自家却沒有沽酒買烟，總是承友朋之惠，多所餽遺。他有惟酒無量之風，我問他二斤如何？他說三斤亦可。他每天早上六時半起身，練習拳術，九時到會處理公務，他對於自己立身處世的短長，有幾點自我批判：（一）余自幼受敎會學校之訓練，抱定克已利人之宗旨，生平不為任何嗜好所困，（二）余以苦學生出身，至今不忘當時之情境，無論際遇如何順利，，向無養尊處優之志願；（三）余偶遇失意之事，從未懊悶，素抱逆來順受之古訓，（四）余生平不存私見，無論對社會，對家庭。寗受犧牲，不圖使宜，（五）余近年來雖多從俗浮沉，然不敢越道德範圍。至於自讅之弱點，為（一）余天性率直，見人有過，必加規勸，甚或面加斥責，偶或不能見諒於人，雖欲勉如涵養工夫，然已不及，（二）二余生平行事，過重情面，往往不顧分量，貿然担任，即如合股無限公司及充任未經辦妥註冊之股份有限公司之董事，並為人作無限之保證等事，明知有破產之虞，然往往以為人不我欺，而不知自戒也，（三））余生平不善理財，祇要手頭有錢，或籌措有方，見人為難，卽為援手，結果自身負担，日見加重，反須至友相助，至覺赮顏耳。說到此地。他希望工商界青年成能將他的自我批判，作為參考。</p>
<p>繼續着他在回憶中，叙述其幼年苦讀的境况，他說：「余十歲時，偕弟就學，三年後，因為家庭的清寒，雖微薄之束修，亦苦於無法籌措，本擬輟學，奈當時即欲習業，又苦於無人提携。其時適英國耶穌敎偕我公會在甬設有開明學堂，附設小學，不取學費，遂往入學，又兩年改設斐迪中學，余弟見兩人，蒙敎士青睞，免費入學。次年考試，幸獲冠軍，復得英京禮敎路生日學校年助獎學金英金六鎊，乃由敎士支配，以半數作學費，半數作家用。」至此，袁先生已為讀書膽家的一個好青年。（未完）</p>

<p>上海保護牲畜會本年三四月份報吿云，在此兩個月內、有無數人士、用電話或親自到本會、請求協助追尋失蹤貓犬、或委託代覓貓犬之收留人、或欲領貓犬豢養等事件、雖則代被棄之貓犬等安排收留及迫尋失蹤貓犬等之事務、可認爲保護牲畜之一法、但多數從事人道事業之會社、俱不視之爲彼等活動範圍以內之事、是以另有自給之小組織、專爲此事而設者、惟上海尙無此類之組織存在、給果本會有限之職員、棋爲此項工作異常繫忙、致佔去其應付更緊急事務之時閒及精力焉</p>
<p>協助保護辦法</p>
<p>社會人士、皆可按照下列辦法、對於此項事務、予本會以極大之助力、（一）執行各種防備方法、以免貓犬走失、或被竊、如囑咐僕役關閉園宅鬥戶、及注意園庭欄柵之完好、（二）僕役溜犬時、須囑其縛韁於犬頸、携之行走、允其在擁擠之街道上、（三）犬之執照牌、須常繫於項圈上、該項圈亦須常爲配帶、則該犬雖或失蹤、亦可有執照號數可稽、以尋獲其主、（四）有欲豢獲貓犬者、可逕往法租界或公共租界工部局狗房挑選、不必先到本會接洽（五）加入本會爲會員及繳納會費或捐助經費、俾克擴大職員人數、以應付此項事務，</p>

<p>當調査員最後一决視察此屠宰塲時、適見一水牛棄伏地上、四肢縛於木柱、頭刖繫於地面之鐵環、頸喉割有的二寸直徑之傷口、正任其流血以斃、</p>
<p>三月七日本會某委員報吿、見有一跛足之馬、被牽拽行於大西路上後經調查、發現此馬乃正被馬夫牽赴上述之屠宰塲、受可怖之死、本會乃即訪晤該馬主、並爲設法以人道化毀滅此馬、</p>
<p>三月三十一日本會接得報吿、謂有一可憐之牛、倒臥於憶定盤路上、調査員蒞該處、即見此母牛已生產一犢、母子皆良好、於是設法護送之而去、</p>

<p>— 尙卿</p>
<p>吿舊嗜好的文學靑年時，我的第一句話是：最好你不耍嗜好文學。現在吿新嗜好的文學靑年時，我所要說的第一句話，也還是：最好你不要嗜好文學。理由前巳說過，現在不　。</p>
<p>無奈現在嗜好舊文學的靑年，固然不少，而嗜好新文學的靑年，更其不可勝數，那末，不得已而求其次，我也就只好就其嗜好，用我誠懇的心願，吿訴嗜好新文學的靑年幾句話：</p>
<p>假使你果然嗜好新文學，你要從事欣賞，研究，或創作，而不曉得究竟從何入手，我對你說從西洋文學入手。我們新文學的成立，可以說完全是受了西洋文學的影響，一些著名的新文學作家，差不多都是精通西洋文舉的。他們從西洋文學入手，所以奠定了我們今日新文學的基礎。但是我們今日的新文學，離開發皇光大，足以昭示後世的地步還很遠，我們還要在這同一的路上努力，最根本的辦法，仍然要先懂西洋文學。</p>
<p>要懂得西洋文學，能够通某一西洋國家的語言，當然最好，可以直接閱讀，否則多多閱讀譯作，也未始不是一個辦法。譯作的文字和內容都好的，當然最適合我們，即使文字差些，只耍內容不差，我們也不妨略貌取神，盡量吸取其精粹。</p>
<p>你閱讀了多少西洋文學，知道了新文學的精神是什麼，新文學與舊文學不同之處是什麽，而一般技術上的要點，你也有所徹悟了，自然你要從事寫作了。也許這時你又要發生一個問題吧：究竟耍用怎樣一種文字去寫才算好呢？或者說，究竟要寫到什麽地步才算好呢？</p>
<p>好的程度是大有伸縮的餘地的，所以我也不能立下一個標準，或定下一個界說，來說怎樣怎樣才算好。不過至少的好的程度，我却可以說的，那就是：要通。字句沒有文法上的錯誤：段落沒有糢糊不淸的弊端，結構沒有過於刻板或過於雜亂的毛病；用意沒有深入而不淺出的短</p>
<p>要通當然是人人所願的；但怎樣才會通呢？也許這一個問題是終於要發生的吧。</p>
<p>解決這一個問題：第一，還是要研究西洋文學；第二，則研究高等新文學作品。西洋文學大都不會不通，但文字旣然兩樣，牠就不能直接有助於我們的文字，所以還只好研究我們己有的高等文學作品。這所謂高等者，也雖於一一指出來，大概的說，商務印醫館，中華書局，世界書局，開明書店，這幾個書局所出的新文學書，都可以算作高等的，其他各書局所出的新文學書，當然也有高等，可是濫竽的也不免，就須加以選探了。</p>
<p>我最不贊成爲了要創作新文學，便一定要去研究舊文學，似乎溫故果然可以知新的。我寗願看見的那呢嗎用得不甚妥當的歐化句子，不願意看見之乎者也用得順溜的國文濫調，因為前者是容易改好的，後者則痼疾已深，就有些不可救藥了。當然，現在的新文學家，也不是研究了西洋文學，完全脫去舊文學，就得以成功的。舊文學也的確可以有助於新文學。然而，我以爲，硏究舊文學，總是弊多利少，爲了免得搖惑人心，還是以不去請敎舊文學爲佳。</p>
<p>我不敢說，現在的各報副刊和各種雜誌，在文字上還沒有到好的地步，所以我們不必取法牠門。但不通的文學，會在副刊上或雜誌上出現，總也是事買吧。因爲副刊和雜誌，都有時間的限制，不免有顧不到處，不像單行本的書籍，得以從容琢磨，力求美善。因此，我希望要想從副刋或雜誌來硏究新文學，以求自己新文學的寫作進步的，耍十分小心才是。至於一些別有用意，自文其淺薄的文字，我以爲允其學不得。</p>
<p>等到你對於新文學的內容和外表，都己有了完全的把握，你自然就可以放筆創作了。可是在你創作時，我還要吿訴你兩句話：</p>
<p>勿利用你的才能，從事破壊性的工作。馬人挖苦人，有時固然也有必要，但不能以為道是文人應有的能事。文學的園地是大的，裏直的花果決不就是罵人或挖苦人。至於罵錯，罵得無理，那當然允其不應該了。爲什麽文人歷來就被人看不起，稱之爲「輕薄」呢？這種傳軋，排斥異己，正也是一個大原因吧！同樣，標榜，彼此互捧，自吹自喝采，也是要不得的，其作用也只有破壊文學，而誤用了你的才能，希望你也能避免。</p>
<p>勿專爲自己寫文章，允其在現在的時世。藝術至上主義的文章，在太平盛世也許可以玩玩，在現在，你有了寫作的才能，就只有供獻給國家與民族才是；至少，即使你要嘆苦，發牢騷，也當看看比你更不幸的人，而爲他們代嘆一聲苦，代發一些牢騒，因爲你有筆不愁沒有機會，他們什麽都沒有，你不帮他們，就沒有人會幫了。因此，我希望你少以身邊瑣事為題材，且以上的話是我對新嗜好的文學靑年說的。當然這是我個人的一孔之見，其中還有許多應加補充或另予討論的地方；爲了篇幅的關係，這裹只好暫時不談。</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記</p>
<p>老邰往瑞昌軍决後，劍雄一因爲假期已滿，不日就要出發咸寗，而我，從六安到了漢口，也必須遄回大別山中，去繼續我應做的工作。這時，武澳外圍的戰事，已進入嚴重階段；但因爲和盧漢將軍訂了會見的預的，不能不稍稽時日，以便一瞻那位滇軍饒將的丯采；况且他在台兒莊一役，建有特殊的功績，爲了蒐集些珍貴的史料，也覺得有會見的必耍；所以雖然整裝待發，還沒有馬上和武漢作別。同時，他這次擔任的防區，恰在粤漢綫的湘省終點，如果三鎭被呑噬的話，那麼，在鄂西方面，他所負的責任很大，因此，我回到大別山中的行期，一展就展延了兩星期。</p>
<p>記得是空襲挺厲害的一天，漢陽飛機塲又添了幾處深潭，總算泥土倒楣，無端飛揚了一回。他們把「悉素敝賦」得來的東西，老是和泥土拚命，眞覺得未免浪費。所以從戰地回來的朋友，對轟炸都表示着滿不在乎的神氣。等到警報解除之後，話機響了：「盧將軍在湖南街鼎裕里等候你，請馬上就來，他下午還要過江去的！一這是政訓處彭處長的口音，一口雲南話。</p>
<p>當我到達了鼎裕里，首先出現在面前的，便是雲南女子戰地工作團的幾位年靑姑娘，一决的訪問，居然很熟識了。可是我有什麽禮物呢？一點都沒有；有的，祇有尊敬的相見禮。</p>
<p>盧將軍會見了，那麼「溫文爾雅」的態度，準會懷疑他是一個學者，不，大學敎授吧？他很有秩序的談話，又活像一位「善於辭令」的外交家。談她們從徐州突圍出來，步行了七百餘里的長途，沒有一些疲乏，和我在華陽見到的皖大女生戰地工作團，同樣的精神抖擻。「聖誕老人來了，一定有什麽禮物帶來的？」姑娘們眞會開玩笑，我和她們　有作過話一直延長到兩小時，只才停止；話題當然是過去的台莊戰役。最後，他說：「在將來凱旋的時候，我們在黃鶴樓頭相見吧！」</p>
<p>誠摯的微笑中，我和盧將軍握手道別。</p>

<h3 id="c114">訴 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>不是低微的呻吟，更不是在風般的呼嘯，只是我們千萬民衆的淚，流成了海，這海裏發出那巨浪似的聲響。我們這千萬困苦的心——也許是最不幸的。那些受着另一種不同的命運支配底人們從不曾想到這只受過了苦難的心，誰知道有時心上被付與深沉的痛楚使我們忘了身體亦是同樣無依的流浪，誰給我們友愛的情誼？那是夢想！他們到底有着自己的命運，有時也拋下給我們一絲眞摯的同情的眼光在一剎那，然而，掉轉頭以後，他們更深戀着自己的命運。向誰去訴？眞理已隱進那深邃的谿谷，早忘掉了我們這一羣人！</p>
<p>我們被支配的演着悲劇，眞理，可會給我們一點光亮？須要有黑暗中的一綫光，只要能給我們一點期望，我們就可以去尋探。</p>
<p>為什麼我們的家園成瓦灰》在那裹面我們並沒有過分的享受：爲什麽那些不成形的血肉　上了我們的稻田？爲什麽奪走了我們的愛兒，他不會得餓着要奶吃，不再親切地偎在懐中喊一聲怕」？爲什麼會讓眼淚滴在那緊抱着的自己巳斷底手臂上？……</p>
<p>眞理，再照明了這世間，別輕輕丟下我們這羣多少萬受苦的人，給我們一綫期望！</p>
<p>漂泊的，無歸宿的行走，永遠沒有季節似的流浪，當熾烈火夏，讓太陽毫不留情的毒射着，汗水浸着不乾的破爛衣服。那兒也有大的房子，然而我們不敢伸足，因爲他們並不需要眞理。日子永遠是這般的溜走，季候對我們並沒有寬裕，刺骨的寒風在嚴冬裹襲着身體，我們披護在身上的依然是炎夏時穿的那件破衣。雖然身體凍僵，可是還有沒凍死而知事的心，這心上永劃着一個疑問—『這難道是眞理的判決？』</p>
<p>天！這並不是詛咒，因爲這也許是命運。看着那光亮而溫暖的地方，但我們沒有勇氣去叩門。誰耐煩聽我們的哀訴？那一扇門肯容納我們這無家的流浪者？即使在風吹倒那抵不住饑寒的軀體，在別人眼中也許等於一隻凍死了的狗！</p>
<p>有誰曾經目睹自己老邁的父母底血塗上了鋒利的尖刀？在那泥灰裹倒臥着在苦痛地呻吟？他們的心也和別人的父母對子女一般的慈愛，但他們却再到興情理相背的遭遇，他們從不怨子女不如別人，然而在他們永別時的心中仍牽揖着一個思念，深怕在這血地上受苦的兒女會遭到更慘酷的摧殘！</p>
<p>每當我們在禱吿着眞理的來臨，覺得喉間塞着東西，像是心裹的血往下滴。自己深沉的話音　成了顫抖的泣聲，還有什麼更苦的等我們去受？然而我們並不企望去死，也許在苦到盡頭時我們終會得到拯救，忍緊了痛，懷着這樣的期望：在層層烏雲後會藏着太陽，黑暗總有被逐出世界的一天！</p>
<h3 id="c115">學哭 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 穀初</p>
<p>好像有人說過一句話：「哭是懦弱的表示。」是的，兩個小孩打架，懦弱者必敗，敗則必一哭」：由此我們也可以證明「哭是懦弱的表示」這句話是對的，那我們又何必去「學」它？</p>
<p>然而聰明人說：哭是一種做人的方法，成功的秘訣。他們的理由是「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，而打動別人惻隱心的方法，便是「哭」。他們又舉了一大批成功的人物，像劉玄德，像申包胥，像……等來證明「哭」是成功的秘訣。「哭」旣是成功的秘訣，則其重要可知，而又烏可不「學」呢？然則如何學？「學」後如何「致用」？不妨舉例以明之：</p>
<p>臂如：你看到了社會上人心不古，世風日下，於是你便在大庭廣衆間演說其補救之法，但是不可不落幾滴眼淚；或者發表論文，可是論文中千萬不可略去了「嗚呼」——西洋化一些的用「喔」——兩個字，那末人家才會給你感動，送你一個「道學家」的頭銜。在馬路上碰到了難民伸手向你討錢時，你儘可掉頭不顧而走——愈走得快愈好；但是回到了府上，却一定要「平平仄仄」做幾首「哀難民」或「哭雖胞」的古詩或新詩，再用上一個「朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨」的古典，登在報紙或雜誌上，於是人家便會稱你是「詩翁」，送你一個「慈善家」的頭銜府上死了父母或其他的尊長，你不妨看看電影或者摟舞女，然而最要緊的還是在「訃」「聞」或「報喪」的廣吿中，決不可漏刋了「泣血」或「技淚」的字樣，雖然你心中是毫不痛苦。但是遇見了朋友，眼睛一定要像血一般地通紅，說起話來，聲音必須略帶些抖顫，那麽人家還是說你能够「哀毀骨立」，冠你以「孝子」之頭銜。同樣，談起國家大事來，必須痛哭流涕，或泣不成聲，表示你的「愛國不敢後人」。因此人家還是冠你以「愛國者」的頭銜……</p>
<p>假使你不要頭銜，那麽哭不是無所施其技了嗎？那，也有其他的用法。</p>
<p>例如：你要向人借錢，必須哭喪着臉，（如能眞哭更好，不能肌至少要帶些哭的樣子，）那末人家才相信你眞個無錢，委實淸苦，吾則，你準會碰壁，撞一鼻子的灰。你在校中成續不及格，你只要到先生那裹，號啕大哭，最好能聲淚俱下，說明這决不及格的理由，那末你便可以及格，可以升級。如果妳同丈夫吵了嘴，或者打了架，吃了虧，那末妳只要「哭」，「哭」祖宗的香台，一小時，兩小時，一天兩天……那末妳的丈夫一定會從此心折，拜倒在你的短旗袍下，唯命是從。</p>
<p>自從哭道問世以後，一傳十，十傳百，競相效允，各運匠心，弄得陰風慘慘，鬼哭神號，於是乎余乃提筆判曰：</p>
<p>「為人之道在偽，為偽之道在哭，聰明人不死，禍亂不止！」</p>

<h3 id="c116">工部局音樂隊主辦之　夏季露天音樂會 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>六月一日開始八月卅一日止　各公園積極佈置樂臺與坐椅</p>
<p>初夏的季候風，帶來了暑熱的信息，把都市罩上了一件夏的外衣，使一切生活的旋動，都趨於夏的急流裏。冷飲品，游泳池都已開始活躍；一切動的，靜的，統隨着時序的轉移而作有規律的更換。</p>
<p>每年夏季，由工部局音樂隊主辦的夏季露天音樂會，現在已準備就緒，提前於六月一日開始演奏。本來往年都是規定七月一日起始，至九月底爲止。今年提早一個月，這種糾正時間配置的錯誤，的確是很適當的，因爲公園裹六月天的遊人正是逐漸增多的時候，而九月天的公園遊人又是正在减少的時期。</p>
<p>現在尙沒到大熱天，法國公園，貝當公園，兆豐公園，外灘公園，膠州公園等的遊人已極度的擁擠，允其是下午徘徊的人羣更多。假如以五百萬市民和這幾個公園面積來作比例的分配算起來，的確是不够的。所以，在「孤島」中，在需要透一下熱氣的季節裏，祇要有一些人工點綴的綠意的地方，就必然的會發生滿坑滿谷的現象。在今年的夏天，似乎任何一個公園裹，都可以舉行露天音樂會，可是，因爲設備和地位上的關係，其演奏的地點祇有四處，就是：兆豐公園，外灘公園，法國公園和法文協會，而法國公園和法文協會又僅有一矮牆之隔，實際上只可算三處。現在規定自六月一開始奏銅樂，每逢星期三，四在法國公園；每逢星期五在外灘公園；每逢星期二，六在兆豐公園。</p>
<p>自六月十四日起，除上述各銅樂會照舊外，並於下午九時至十一時在下列二處演奏管弦樂：—每逢星期四在法文協會；每逢星期一，六在兆豐公園。</p>
<p>現在各公園常局對於演奏臺和坐椅等，都在積極地佈置和洗刷。除兆豐公園是有一個現成的半圓形的音樂臺；外灘公園也有一個現成的六角亭外；法國公園的演奏臺是在該園中部的大樹叢下用洋松木板臨時搭成；法文協會的演奏臺就是利用房屋前原來的露臺，用藍布圍遮而成的。</p>
<p>當露天音樂會演奏的時候，各公園裏除門券外，還須另外購票。管弦樂會分一元及五角二種；銅樂會不售票，但租借帆布睡椅，每位取費二角。</p>
<p>根據以往的情况和經騐看來，因爲所演奏的大都是歐西各國的名曲，國人中除一小部份對於音樂藝術有硏究者外，大部份人對於那種音律，樂理，性質，樂曲出典，文學上的價値及其演奏的技術等等，都不甚瞭解，祗以其響聲來調劑聽覺上的單調和枯寂而已。所謂藝術的，詩意的欣賞，尙沒有普遍，沒有大衆化，所以聽衆就不如低級歌舞那麼的擁擠，甚至一排排的睡椅空空如也，等於虛設。在這裏，就可看得出一般人對音樂藝術的欣賞程度。</p>
<p>不過，在另一方面以節省消費的原則來說，到是不化錢坐於草地上聆聽爲宜，因爲音調旣和睡在椅上聽的無差別，而又不必受地位的的束，可以行動自由，何况不一定要化了錢才算懂得音樂藝術哩！祗要你有閑空的時間，在兩個月內，每天下午或晚上，儘可不化錢盡量的去聽一個滿足啊！</p>
<h3 id="c117">震旦博物院別記 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭燕</p>
<p>有各種昆蟲孵化的過程　有彩色絢爛蝴蝶的標本　是法國神父的心血結晶</p>
<p>埋葬在色情風味中的七海智識階級層，大多數是很少上博物館這一類硏究學術的地方的，說穿了講，能够常常到圖書館去聞聞書館香味的人，也能有幾個？</p>
<p>有人說過，中國科學不進步，我說，最少，最少，得改變改變上海人的生活環境。</p>
<p>關於博物院，我知道上海租界上一共有兩個，一個是博物院路的博物院，一個是附屬於震旦大學的博物院。</p>
<p>在滬戰以前，上海市政府曾化了很多錢建築了一所博物館，而且舉行過一决歷代建築展覽會，對古代建築物的偉大，有過很詳細的說明及介紹。</p>
<p>現在，這所博物館是埋葬在烟火瓦礫中了，這確使人引起無限滄桑之感的。</p>
<p>關於震旦的博物院，以前沒有開放的時候，我曾破例去參觀過一决，前天下午他們舉行七十週年紀念典禮，所收集的各種標本，也格外豐富了。</p>
<p>現在僅就各報所沒有記載的材料，記一點下來：</p>
<p>由震旦這所有七十年歷史的博物院，我們同時可以看出，宗敎學術者，他們在中國所化的精力，的確是驚人的。由創始者韓德神父開始，一直經過雷神父，柏神父，白神父，松神父，到現在負責的鄭神父，他們始終不停不息的，經過多少艱苦與奮鬥，才收成現在這麼許多可貴的標本。</p>
<p>這許多神父，他們都專門收集一二種標本，比如雷紳父收集的鹿的標本，是遠東最豐富的（現在共有標本三千六百七十五種）；創辦人韓德神父爲了搜集各種標本，差不多環繞了地球七决之多；到現在，他父留給中國很多本寳貴的「中國目然歷史」著作，這些著作，對中國硏究自然科學的，是有着多大的貢獻呵。還有白神父，他是專門硏究植物的，松神父是專門收集昆蟲的。</p>
<p>整個博物院，一共有三層，底層是古物及銅器，這一層我以前參觀過；第二層是植物標本，及動物標本；三樓爲昆蟲，貝壳，鳥類等標本。</p>
<p>昆蟲標本中間，很有許多你從來沒有見過的各種各式的蟲子，螞蟻，他們怎樣生活，怎樣孵化的過程；比如一個細小的竹管中間，却是一個小蟲最完善的孵化的處所；一塊泥土中間，却是另一種蟲子最完好的家庭，這些標本，都是活生生的，一步一步把牠們的巢穴，變化，標明出來。</p>
<p>尤其是許多彩色絢爛的蝴蝶標本，的確好看極了，這些代表自然界彩色的昆蟲類，是値得使人留戀的。</p>
<p>在鳥類中間，也更有很多精巧的標本，如一種　小的小鳥，怎樣在一個樹枝及竹管中間，安置牠們的巢窩，牠們又怎樣孵化牠們的卵蛋。</p>
<p>參觀過這所包括有動物，植物，昆蟲數十萬種標本的震旦博物院，愈加使人感覺自然界的偉大與美麗。</p>
<p>昨天起這博物院公開開放二星期，二星期以後，進去參觀的，也許得略收小費。</p>

<h3 id="c121">「雪夜洗寃」觀感 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Let　Us　Live”</p>
<p>哥倫比亞公司出品　南京映</p>
<p>看完了「雪夜洗寃」出來，我不禁想起保羅茂尼的『亡命者』來，同時更記起影片公映時，在某報上發表的一篇「法律不外乎人情」的文章來。是的，一個爲社會建立了許多事業，在社會上也有相當地位的人物，他過去是個逃犯，爲保障人權的法律還是鐵面無私地去剝奪了他的自由。所以「亡命者」與其說它是暴露鍊獄的黑暗，還不如劇作者對於法律的懐疑。</p>
<p>「雪夜洗寃」中的汽車夫布立克，因爲被原主誤認爲盜匪，又因爲他的情人曼麗無法提出在盜刦的時間內他確是站在敎堂門外的反證，於是在「衆口一詞，百喙莫辯一的法律下，被判決了死刑。劇作者的所以創造這樣一個故事，倒並不是和其他一切寃獄片那樣，以曲折離奇的情節，而最後在千鈞一髮之際，發現正兇，來刺激觀衆的；這里，他也和「亡命者」同樣對法律抱了懐疑的態度，和對執法者之草菅人命有所諷刺。譬如探長伊夫列特發現了槍彈之後，確信布立克是寃枉的，而力懇檢察簽暫緩執行，但是檢察長的回答是「這不是我份內之事。」一又探長和曼麗到紐的探悉了正兇，請求警署協助的時候，也因手續未合，而遭拒絕。最後布立克「雪夜洗寃」，釋放出獄，檢察長向他聲明「這是我的職務」的時候，布立克拒絕了他的請求握手，而向探長道謝，昂然而出。這些都能明顯看出劇作者的本意所在。所以LetUs　Live，並不是僅僅有一個幼童（他發現匪車）和探長的出力所可以解決的，這里，執法者應該盡力之所能及，詳細地審察案情，收集證據，及使被告有充份提出反證的時間，然後才能减少寃獄的發生（能絕對沒有當然更好）；同時法律是死的東西，怎樣在特殊情形之下，而權衡輕重，參以「人情」的折衝，這是有待於法學家的研究了。</p>
<p>導演者處理本片的手法，也是相當可愛的。他把每一塲戲的情緒都使它充份的發展，而剪輯的緊湊，及得力於攝影者更多。譬如兩次的行刦，攝影師都利用强弱的光來帮助富時緊張的空氣。</p>
<p>至於亨利方達，我同意李之華先生的意見，他的汽車夫是演得非常沉着有力的，而出塲時和瑪琳歐莎麗文的熱愛，頗有却爾福雷在「七重天」中的風度。瑪琳歐莎麗文（曼麗）和賴甫白萊梅（探長）的戲也不弱。</p>

<h3 id="c122">最近上海日圓跌價原因的分析 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 史亦聞</p>
<p>自「華興銀行」於本月十六日開幕後，一般不明內情的人，都惶惶不安，以爲法幣的價値，將遭受重大的壓迫，上海的金融市塲，亦將不免受其影響。但迄至目前，事實昭示吾人：法幣的價値，固未絲毫變動，上海的金融市塲，亦未有任何不穩現象，證明了因「華興銀行」成立而憂慮的，正是庸人自擾。</p>
<p>其實，就目前上海金融市塲的實際情形來看，因「華興銀行」的成立而受其影響的不是中國的法幣，倒是日圓自己。在「華興銀行」開幕前數日，（五月十三日）日圓與法幣黑市塲的比價，爲日圓一〇〇圓，換法幣一○二元强；但自十六日（華興銀行開慕日）起，日圓已跌與法幣等價，至今日，（五月二十日）竟跌至祗能換法幣九十五元了。（見昨日本報）在這一週以內，日圓對法幣，已跌價八元以上，而此種跌勢，今後尙有繼續發展的可能。</p>
<p>日圓的跌價，本不是今日始。憶在去年六七月間，日圓在公開市塲的行市，要比法幣貴三○％左右，（即日圓一○〇圓，可換法幣一三〇元左右）至九月間即降至二〇％，（卽日圓一〇〇圓，可換法幣一二〇元）至今年一二月間又降至一〇％（即日圓一○〇圓，可換法幣一一〇元）至最近，竟跌至與法幣的平價以下。如果用英滙來換算，在去年的九月間，日圓的滙値，已自其基準滙値（一先令二辦士）跌至十辦士，至今年一二月間已跌至九辦士，至最近巳跌至七辦士左右。日圓這種不斷的跌勢，當然不是偶然的現象，而是有其客觀的原因。値得吾人硏究的。</p>
<p>在去年九月間，日圓跌價正劇時，筆者曾爲文滙報撰文，（見九月二十日該報經濟特載）指出其跌價的原因，茲摘錄其中的一節，以爲參考：</p>
<p>「自一九三七年戰事爆發後，日本紙幣流入中國者，不下二萬萬圓。其中流入華北者的一萬萬五千萬圓，（大部爲朝鮮銀行紙幣）流入江南戰區者，的五千萬圓，（大部爲日本銀行紙幣）此等紙幣之來源，一部爲日軍在戰區內措辦軍需之資金，大部則爲在華作戰日軍士兵的俸給。在二三月（去年）間，日圓流入上海的巳有五千萬圓之巨，至五六月間，復有一部投機商人，利用上海法幣，套買華北日圓，因此華北日圓，滾滾南下，上海竟成日圓泛濫之所。上海的日圓，爲數旣增，要是可以自由購買外匯，則其價値自不成問題，但在日政府嚴格管理之下，欲購買百圓以上的外滙，即須呈請核准，條件非常苛刻·不特此也，上海的日商銀行，對於以日圓償付由日本輸出的貨價的交易（如押匯）也拒予接受。（其目的在限制無外匯的貨物的出口）上海日圓所處的環境旣如此，而上海市塲對牠的實際需要又不大，因此成了半身不遂的通貨，而其價値的跌落，也自然是不可避免的了。</p>
<p>上面是日圓在去年九月間跌價的一般原因，但是目前日圓的跌價，其情形怎樣呢？首先將日人方面自己的說法，加以介紹。</p>
<p>日人認爲目前上海日圓的跌價，其最大原因，有下述三點：第一，是因東北及華北方面限制大豆及豆油輸入華中的結果。過去，自東北及華北輸入上海方面的大豆及豆油價値，每月的計二三百萬元，目前上海方面旣無此種物品的輸入，則上海每月就要多出二三百萬圓的日圓頭寸；上海日圓頸寸的過剩，自使日圓的價値低落。</p>
<p>第二是因日本來華的人數激增，日圓也就大量隨帶而來。據四月份的統計，自日來滬的日人，共八千三百五十人，如每人平均携帶五百日圓，則在一月中，流入上海的日圓，便有四百萬圓，一年中便成五千萬圓。在沒有日圓地位的上海金融市塲中，要容納這樣巨額的頭寸，自然是很困雖的，由此影響於匯値，也是免不了的事。</p>
<p>第三，是因日本限制對華中方面貨物的輸出，减少日圓的需要。因着佔領區日貨供給的减少，則佔領區的人民，自然要以日本所發行的軍用票，運至上海，掉換日圓，復由日圓換成法幣，以法幣向外商或華商採辦所需的物資：因此，佔領區人民對於法幣大量的需要的結果，自然會使日圓受壓迫而跌價。（參看五月十九日上海每日新聞）</p>
<p>以上三種情形，我們也承認確是目前日圓跌價的原因，但只是表面的原因，派生的原因。根本上是在日本的國力問題。換言之，是在日圓的購買力問題。我們知道，日本自從發動對華戰爭後，其所消耗的軍費，已達百萬萬圓之鉅。軍事費的消耗，事實上就是物力的消耗，也就是國力的消耗。要是日本的生產力足以適應巨大的軍事消耗，則日政府欲通過財政的機構，來動員戰爭所需的物資，固不成問題，然而大家知道，日本的生產力是非常脆弱的，非特未能因戰事的大量消耗，補充其戰事所需的物資，而且反因戰事物力與人力大量的消耗，益見其生產力的捉襟見肘，入於衰竭之迷。現在日政府只靠竭澤而漁的辦法，增發紙幣，創造新購買力，去徵發憚的積蓄力，維持其對外戰爭。試看日圓紙幣的發行數額，已自一九三七年六月的十五萬萬圓增至目前的二十五萬萬圓左右了。（去年底一度增至二十九萬萬圓）在戰後二十個月中，新購買力（紙幣）的數額，竟較戰前增加幾近一倍，而其國內的物資（包積蓄力及生產力）並未跟着僞造的購買力數量而遞增，（事實上是在减少中）因此購買力與物資間失却了相對的均衡，在其國內所表示的就是物價的飛漲，在國外所表示的就是日圓滙値的跌落。</p>
<p>目前日圓在上海的跌價，也就是其購買力减低的證據。但日圓在上海的跌價，不僅是對法幣的跌價，（因爲法幣價値並未變動）而是對一切外幣的跌價·不過，上海日圓的跌價，除了上述的購買力减低的原因外，尙有卜述二種原因，也是不可忽視的：</p>
<p>第一：是因近來華北僞聯銀券的跌價，使日圓也跟着跌價。僞聯銀券的跌價，由於華北僞府及日軍在財政上的需要，因而濫事發行者一半，由於人民對僞聯銀券價値的慮懼，而以僞聯銀券掉換貨物（或法幣）者亦一半。因僞聯銀券與日圓的等價關係，使日圓的價値也爲之拉低；於是復有一部投機者（包括日本人）以法幣套買華北日圓，復以日圓運至上海套買法幣，益使上海的日圓加甚對法幣的需要，而壓迫其價値的跌落。</p>
<p>第二：是因「華興銀行」紙幣的發行計劃，必無形减少日圓的實際需要；同時又因「華興銀行」的紙幣，並無確實準備，將來必因濫發而跌價，（一如華北僞聯銀券的情形）日本早知其此種後果，故宜佈「華興券」不與日圓聯繫；無異反映日圓某礎的空虛。因之一般人民（包括日本人）多不敢收藏日圓，而寗掉換價値穩定之法幣，（或購買貨物）因使法幣價値相對的增高，而使日圓價値步步下跌。</p>
<p>上述的二種原因，所以會有力的促使上海日圓的跌價，正因日圓購買力根本减低之故。也可說是通貨膨脹的結果。則由此所表示的不僅是日圓對外的信用的動搖，而且是說明日本在對華戰爭中，所受的損失之重大。要是對華戰爭，仍無法結束，則今後日本國力的消耗，一定與日俱增，而日圓的購買力，也必日趨惡化。日圓購買力惡化的結果，不僅將使其維持戰爭發生種種困難，而且將促使其全體國民經濟的總崩潰。目前日圓不斷的跌價，已可看出日本已在走向總崩潰的路。反之：目前法幣價値的穩定，與對日圓價値的相對的騰貴，正證明中國採取長期消耗戰戰略的正確，表示中國在軍事上已走向優勢的過程，最後勝利是不成問題的。</p>
<h3 id="c123">「華興銀行」與上海市塲 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 辛亥</p>
<p>所謂「華興商業銀行」，對於上海市場，影響是渺乎其小的；市面雖流言蜚語，只要庸人不自擾，「華興」是奈何不得的。</p>
<p>但當「華興」成立的消息傳出後，法幣的外滙音盤，遠期曾經一度緊縮，此蓋當初市塲人心未能沉着，對於牠認識不足所致；及認識了牠的性質，伎倆，故即安定如恒。但當牠在十六日開業之日，又不知從那裏散放出種種毫無根據的謠言，致使敏感的市塲，又受了一度可笑的簸弄；公債暗　，因之忽降。筆者所聽到的謠言，大概有四說：</p>
<p>一　說是國府為抵禦「華興」的奪取法幣計，擬以劃頭代替五元以上的法幣流通，僅留一元以下的小額通貨在市塲流通，以後只有劃頭可以購買外匯云。</p>
<p>二　說是國府對於公債的還本付息，此後將全部改在重慶付款，不再用在「重慶一次付給，對滬分六期付款」的辦法，以減少法幣頭寸流入上海云。</p>
<p>三　說是將逐漸收回中央，中國，交通的法幣，任令其餘八家合法的商業銀行所發紙幣及雜鈔流通，而此項非中，中，交鈔票，無購買外匯之資格云。</p>
<p>四　說是現有的法幣外匯平衡基金。將分攤給中，英，美三國，僅對中，英，美，三方面供給，對普通需要，則暫不予以供給云。</p>
<p>這種謠言竟使市場一部份人為之衝動，實在未免太缺乏判斷力了。先從第一點來說，賢明的當局，決不會出此减損法幣威信的下策。因爲，如果只許劃頭購買外滙，那末法幣調劃頭必至貼水，法幣貼水，便與法幣跌價無異；而且法幣在付出貼水，調得劃頭後，仍能購買外滙，怎能因多出調劃頭一道手續，而防止偽「華興」籍吸收法幣奪取外匯的企圖？大概這一個謠言，是起因於洋商銀行的劃頭對法水的。洋商銀行爲避免法幣計算的煩雜，劉頭是實，但並不能因之而認爲劃頭的代流通，彰彰明甚。</p>
<p>第二點同樣可笑，即使國府想收縮戰區內的法幣，也不必彈此老調，况政府維持債信，素具決心；自不會撤消前决的諾言，而且政府儘可從別方面制限法幣流到上海來，爲何一定要在這公債本息的付款上打算盤呢？</p>
<p>第三點，也是不可能的，如果政府收回中中交三行鈔票，任令雜鈔流通，豈不是等於政府自己打自己的嘴巴？中中交鈔票是法幣，其他商業銀行所發的也是法幣，前者可以購買外滙，而後者不能購買外滙，這不是自己破壊業巳統一的幣制麽？即在天津租界內也永不會有收回法幣的事。且恰恰相反，當華北資金紛紛南逃時，天津的中國交通兩行，反限制申匯，維持法幣在華北原有的流通數量，因為倘使收回法幣，租界內便無可資流通的通貨，那未，偽幣便可乘機而來，奪得法幣的流通區域。政府當局豈譬如此發傻嗎？</p>
<p>最後一點，誰都知道，法幣平衡基金的設立，是為了安定法幣的對外價值，所以凡是持有法幣的人，倘有必要，不論其爲華商英商等等，均能購得外滙；法幣的持有人固有國籍的分別，但法幣決不是因持有人國籍的不同而異其價値的。所以攤派法幣平衝基金云云，不値識者一笑。要防禦流入僞「華興」的途徑多着呢！如不使內地物產落入日僞之手，不買日貨等均是。</p>
<p>其實，就是不經過上面的剖析，單憑今日市塲的轉穩，統一各債的回好，也可以證明這種種謠言的不足信了。</p>

<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>在發表的數字上中國紡織廠，允其是紗廠，在中日戰爭內所受的損失和毀壊的程度，着實驚人，至於工作的停頓和工廠設備的摧毀，影響於資本家和工人的福利與繁榮關係更大，因爲紡織業在中國是重要的工業，僱用勞工和所投資本較任何其他工業爲多。吾人從各團體，紡織廠管理者外國代理處與保管者，調查所得的現况，或與道些紡織廠有關的各方面，而得的情報，可信是很可靠的。</p>
<p>但也有因日軍利用若干廠屋作軍用醫院或總司令部，除日人外，誰都不准入內，所以這些紡織廠，幾乎不能確知其實况，祇能约略估計房屋損壞的程度，關於屋內的機器，很難確知，據各方面消息表示，日軍已將上海佔據區內華方紗廠的機器和馬達，運到靑島而裝在日方紗廠裹。</p>
<p>華方紗廠現在情形可分為下列數類：</p>
<p>（一）被日軍强迫接收，而現在由日軍為自己利益計而開工的，計二十六家，有綻子六八一·九六〇錘，雙紡機四二·九五錘，織布機六·二四四架。</p>
<p>魯·晋·豫三省的紗廠，確實全被接受，在織造軍衣，或被利用為軍用機器修理廠。這些被沒收的工廠裹，僅僱　籍苦力和普通工人，若干華方紗廠即由外人保管和經營的，也被接收，例如德商藹益吉公司經營的大生紗廠第一·三·八廠，在今年三月三日被强迫接收，德國大使館雖和日方從事談判，但至今還無結果。約言之，日方强迫接收的華商紗廠約佔錠子總數的四分之一。</p>
<p>（二）毀壞一部份或頗重的，而現在日方修茸八·〇〇七架。</p>
<p>這類紡織廠大半在蘇省上海租界區以外，無錫和常州的華方紡織廠完全歸在這類中。</p>
<p>（三）被日軍佔作軍用醫院和總司令的紡織廠，計五家，有錠子二七六·八三〇錘，雙紡機四四·二六六錘，織布機二·一一五架。</p>
<p>這類紡織廠大多在上海四週，永安紡織有限公司的第一·二·三廠等，都被佔據，不准任何國籍的人入內。</p>
<p>（四）在上海租區和未發生戰事區內，照常工作的紡織廠，計十五家，有錠子四三七·五六二錘，雙紡機三四·八九八錘，和織布機二·六一〇架。</p>
<p>這類紡織廠大多在上海公共租界中心和陝·滇二省中，自軍興以來，獲利特厚。</p>
<p>（五）出日方經營，表面上按照所謂中日合作計劃，即日人得凈利百分這五十一，華人得自分之四十九的紡織廠，計五家（包括大染織廠一家在內），有錠子四二·三二八錘，雙紡機七·九八〇錘，和織布機一·五〇〇架。</p>
<p>這些紡織廠的管理者已和日方妥協，並已作若干秘密的佈置，其中三家在上海，一在皖省蕪湖，一在冀省唐山。</p>
<p>（六）將全部機器中一部份移住重慶。西安等內地城市和上海公共租界的紡織，計十一一家，有錠子三一五·一六二錘，雙紡織機五·六〇〇錘，織布機二·二九三架。</p>
<p>這些遷移紡織廠大多已易名稱，有許多以外商名義登記，或改由中國銀行經營。</p>
<p>（七）漢口紗廠第一廠的機器，今包括錠子八八·一六〇錘，織布機六四八架，存在漢口外國倉庫中，該廠現由英商妥利公司保管。</p>
<p>（八）在日軍佔據區內較不利的中心地，因中國流動部隊時常襲擊，或運輸和交通困難而今在停工中的紡織廠，計八家，有錠子一七二·〇四四錘，變紡機八·四〇〇錘，織布機九二〇架。</p>
<p>浦東的恒大紗廠，說因中國流動部隊的活躍而今在停工中，上海四郊的其他紡織廠也因同樣理由而停工。</p>
<p>（九）戰時停工，而自去年起復工的紡織廠，計有：閘北的崇信，以英商名義登記，和楊樹浦區的英商怡和紗廠</p>
<p>（十）所說機器已被日方方運出的有下列各紡織廠！恒　紡織公司，以英商名義登記的申新紗廠第七廠，大華染織公司，以上都在楊樹浦，和以英商名義登記的的閘北振泰紗廠。</p>
<p>（十一）戰起後在上海開設的有安達紡織公司錠子一五·〇〇〇錘，中紡公司，錠子二六·〇〇○錘織布機三〇〇架，中國紗廠，錠子一五·〇〇〇錘，（以上均以英商名義登記），國棉紗製造公司，錠子二六·〇〇〇錘，德紡織公司，錠子一〇·三四〇錘，布機一二八架，以上均以美商名義登記，榮豐紗廠，錠子一〇·〇〇〇錘，和豐紡織公司，錠子五·〇〇（錘，織布機一五〇架，新生紗廠，錠子一〇·三六〇錘，肈興紗廠，錠子八·四〇〇錘，達豐染織廠，中國毛織公司，毛紡錠子四·〇〇〇錘，織布機一〇〇架。</p>
<p>上述各廠的機器，不是從無錫等內地城市到的。（未完）</p>

<p>— 汪孚禮</p>
<p>閱第七表，華廠紡織機器，旣减少至如此之鉅，其所出紗布，雖因粗細種類之不同，不必恰依此比例而减少，但其供不應求之狀况，自可推知而有餘，即合英商日商所自有或其所佔用者而計之，亦如第八表所示。</p>
<p>閱第八表，可知紗布之為物，國人縱不盡購國產，其所能供給之數量，較戰前亦減少四成左右，卽此一端，已大有漲價之餘地，何況尙夾有其他各種原因乎，所謂迄今尙維持相當之高價者，良有以也，應時勢之需要、在戰前所定購之新機及在戰地移走之舊機，現在後方積極設廠而可卽開出者，尙有相當數目，兼以帶有機性之穆氏手紡機，業精手紡織，廣世手紡機，及印度紡水車紡等相繼籌設，深信在不久將來，必能得到相當之產時，邇時日常所必需之紗布市價，當亦可隨而下落也，且拭目以視之。（完）</p>

After a day and night of bloody battle, many Japanese soldiers were killed. At this moment, the Huajun troops pursuing and tying up the Japanese army from the Xiangsha Highway have arrived at a certain place and will soon carry out a great annihilation war.

According to the Huajun war report, after the Huajun recaptured Tanghe and Tongbai, it continued to advance south and recovered Zaoyang on the morning of May 19. It then launched an attack on Suixian. The situation in Nanyang and Xinye has also eased since the arrival of the elite division of Sun Lianzhong's troops. Sun's troops have fought in Hebei. Jin. Henan. Shandong. Hubei. provinces and have achieved great battle achievements. People from all walks of life in China here believe that the week that is now beginning will be a crucial moment in the Sino-Japanese war. It is expected that within this week, the success or failure of Japan's current large-scale offensive against Xiangyang. Fancheng. Nanyang and Yichang areas will be determined, or the Huajun will be able to inflict a decisive blow on the Japanese army in Northern Hubei. If the Huajun can win in Northern Hubei, it will be able to thwart any Japanese military progress in China for at least three months. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Huajun's Tactics of Luring the Enemy Deep Have Been Very Successful <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Northern Hubei recently arrived at the front line in Northern Hubei to inspect. He met with two commanders one after another and learned about the recent course of the war in Northern Hubei. Now, a brief record is as follows: The Japanese army's decision to attack our Northern Hubei adopted a strategy of central breakthrough and flanking encirclement in the Suixian area. After five days of attack, it was first defeated at Ta'erwan and then at Yinjiadian. None of the planned attempts were successful. At that time, the Huajun had repeatedly decided to deliberately break a gap in the front line to lure the enemy deep. The enemy fell for the trick every time. As a result, more than two Japanese regiments were eliminated before and after. This tactic was named "opening the mouth of the bag to catch hairy rats" by a certain military strategist of ours. Six days later, the enemy failed to attack the right flank, so it attacked on the left flank, that is, all the Japanese troops in Zhongbei were transferred north. At that time, we had already seen through the enemy's intention to eliminate our main force, so we dealt with them on the one hand and redeployed the front line on the other hand. In addition to surrounding Suixian with two large groups of troops in the two directions of Sui Bei and Zhe He, the Japanese army also窜 out a group from the Jingshan direction, extending north to the vicinity of Zaoyang, and then divided into two routes to encircle Zaoyang on the left and right. At the same time, the Japanese army in Zhongxiang Yangzi area was divided into two groups and moved north,窜至 near the Xianghua Road, and then divided into four routes to cut off the Xiangzao Highway. The enemy thus formed multiple blockade lines on the Xianghua Road, thinking that the main force would definitely move west, so that our main force would be destroyed under its layers of blockade lines. Unexpectedly, our army had already moved north at this time, causing the enemy to pounce on a big emptiness. On the 12th, our troops from Southern Henan arrived and gave the enemy a head-on blow, so the enemy fled southeast in a panic, and was attacked by us everywhere. Its predicament in the quagmire can be obtained from this a powerful 瞪明. (21st Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Expectations for Today's League of Nations Administrative Council Standing Committee Meeting <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The 105th Standing Committee Meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council will be held in Geneva today. According to frequent telegrams, among the agenda items of this Standing Committee meeting, there are two proposals of a political nature: one is the issue of fortifying the Aland Islands in Finland, and the other is China's proposal on the War of Resistance. In addition, unrelated to this meeting, but due to the convenience of diplomatic representatives from various countries gathering in Geneva to exchange opinions, or even conduct negotiations, there are three important matters: 1. The issue of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union concluding an alliance to form an anti-aggression group; 2. The issue of the Free City of Danzig; 3. The issue of revising the League of Nations Charter and reorganizing the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The League of Nations once served as the center of international affairs. Although it had its congenital defects from the beginning due to the United States not participating, and the Soviet Union's accession boosted its influence, thereafter, Japan used force to invade China, and the League of Nations failed to impartially apply the League's charter; Italy launched an expedition to Abyssinia, and the League of Nations launched a deformed sanction that was ineffective; Japan, Italy, and Germany successively declared their withdrawal from the League of Nations; thus, the prestige and reputation of the League of Nations gradually declined, and it almost ceased to be the center of international affairs. However, this is still the largest international group, and its function is still questionable, but the charter still exists. It is believed that human wisdom and action, the development and progress of personnel, will inevitably resemble the folding of waves, and cannot be expected to be as straight as an arrow; therefore, those who create international brightness and maintain international order should hope to strengthen the League of Nations and enrich it to reach health, rather than hoping to abandon the League of Nations, reform it, and start anew. Even with regard to the United States, if it is always hindered by isolationism, regards the New World as a separate paradise, and believes that all demons cannot enter, and can be alone; otherwise, although the United States is extremely rich and strong, and its actions are important, it is like the leader of both hemispheres, but once it decides to participate in the world's international organizations, it will certainly not seek a foundation outside the League of Nations. Perhaps some people belittle the League of Nations' frequent setbacks, such as the sacrificial sheep of the lunar announcement, but in fact, this is not the case; the League of Nations is still complete in its five senses, outstanding in its intelligence, but its blood and energy are insufficient, and its instincts are not strong. It is the son of a civilized group of people. And the current member states of the League of Nations,. Cherish it, love it, support it, and hope that its morality and industry will improve day by day, and it will be strong and promising, and overcome what it bears as soon as possible; it is currently able to do one thing within its ability, do one thing, and do three or five things if it can do three or five things. As for the United States in the League of Nations, it is also a moral friendship that is closely related to pain and well-being. Only because of this, we sincerely hope that its administrative council meeting today will be vigorous and show great achievements! With the greatness of expression and achievement, expecting the Standing Committee of the League of Nations today, is it too extravagant? Although the League of Nations has its universality, it is actually focused on Europe, and the great power in the association is controlled by Britain and France; now the European continent is full of crises, and it is impossible to do anything, this is one; what the League's charter stipulates is ignored, feared, and opposed, how can it be expected to quickly revitalize the outline, this is two; those that have been proposed but not discussed, discussed but not decided, and decided but not implemented, are countless, let alone create something else, this is three. Yesterday's newspaper published a Reuters telegram from Geneva, saying that "The Danzig issue is not on the agenda, because everyone feels that it is not appropriate to deal with such an explosive issue at the moment;" a few words can prove the futility of extravagance.</p>
<p>However, there are those who should not think like this, and cannot view it like this. The gradual decline of the League of Nations' prestige and reputation was half self-inflicted and half due to the environment; as of today, international circumstances and politicians' understanding have been repeatedly decided by painful experiences and lessons, and they are no longer the same as before. To state one point: the League of Nations Charter has always been the same; however, in the past, the international community still retreated, compromised, and appeased, but now it is striving to organize anti-aggression groups, fearing that it is too late; try to measure, was the international situation in the past close to the League Charter? Is the current international situation close to the League Charter? Then how can we underestimate the League of Nations today and in the future because of its inability to achieve anything in the past. Furthermore, in terms of the League of Nations' environment, those who hated the League of Nations in the past were arrogant and imposing, but now they are tending to decline; in the past, the United States always maintained parallel relations with the League of Nations in diplomacy, but now the United States and the main member states of the League of Nations have begun to be consistent in action; then should the League of Nations not adapt to the environment and grind itself more? The husband's words are by no means a one-sided wish from the Far East. Reuters' London telegram on the 18th said:</p>
<p>"A delegation organized by Lord Cecil, President of the League of Nations Association. Former Indian Governor-General Lord Snell. And Lord Listowel, a Labor Party member of the House of Lords, will visit Foreign Secretary Halifax tomorrow to urge the British government to do its best in Geneva to take active action by the League of Nations to help China."</p>
<p>Also, a Havas telegram from London on the 20th said:</p>
<p>"The British Aid China Movement has just issued a statement requesting the League of Nations General Assembly to implement the resolutions passed by the Executive Council in the past, that is, the resolution advocating that each member state individually aid China, which should be implemented immediately. The method is no more than the following three points: (1) Refuse to supply Japan with war supplies. In particular, the export of aircraft to that country should be prohibited. (2) Boycott Japanese goods, so as to inflict a major blow on the country's economy in a short period of time. (3) Provide financial and economic assistance to China, so as to build the southwestern provinces, develop industrial cooperation movements, and relieve refugees in the war zone. The above actions should be adjusted by a committee established by the Executive Council to improve its efficiency. Recently, the governments of certain member states of the League of Nations have declared their willingness to support the collective security system. If the Executive Council of the League of Nations can help China, it will be a great contribution to the collective security system. Moreover, the United States is also willing to actively participate in the work of aiding China, which can be seen from President Roosevelt's recent words and deeds."</p>
<p>From these two examples, it can be seen that the world's public opinion is rising compared to the past, so the League of Nations should not be timid and unenterprising.</p>

<p>(Chongqing) General Chiang Kai-shek, today expressed his views at the second annual meeting of the China Branch of the Second International Peace Movement, strongly condemning "appeasementism that has been destroyed and has no credibility," and requesting that "the majority of the world's rational citizens resist the minority of fanatics with firm determination." General Chiang continued, "This meeting of yours contains extremely important significance. At a time when the Sino-Japanese war is in progress and countries are preparing for war, you are gathering together to seek ways to stabilize world peace. The main point of this is self-evident. Because the current world's storms and waves are running counter to the great goal of your work. If you achieve something, it is also an expression that this meeting has the determination. This determination must be based on the only remaining realistic part today. The majority of the world's rational citizens resist the minority of fanatics with firm awakening, and not based on appeasementism that has been destroyed and has no credibility. A government will never allow criminals in its country to operate freely in the government, so this world must also recognize those irresponsible rulers who go against the right path and lead their countries to act in violation of world peace, and should find ways to punish them, because their actions are no different from a criminal in society. Regarding China's war of resistance against Japanese aggression, General Chiang said, I sincerely hope that our struggle, its completion or not too late, can avoid a larger war including the whole world. Only countries that love peace and are deeply aware, "can accelerate," and countries that love peace help China accelerate the completion of its task of resistance, so that a war that includes the whole world and is far greater can be avoided, then the value of our efforts to resist the war is several times greater than this. Therefore, we are not only fighting for ourselves, but also for the world. , We feel this responsibility to the whole world, so our determination and courage have increased sharply. The reason why we try our best to endure the pain of war is that we hope that the world will be aware of the morbid psychology and perverse measures of the aggressors, weigh the gains and losses of peace, and thus be able to produce good results. General Chiang also said that he wishes the world's people to witness the true face of war, remember it in their hearts, and take action in time. This is the consolation I seek for the suffering China has suffered. Finally, Mr. Chiang expressed that I would like to take this opportunity to offer the above views to you, and I would like to extend my most sincere goodwill to you and wish you success in this valuable effort.

<p>The total amount has reached 10 million yuan, and a medical team has been formed to go to the front line.</p>
<p>Batavia Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have donated money to China, specifically for military expenses, and the amount has reached 10 million yuan. In Batavia alone, 4.5 million yuan has been donated since the outbreak of the war. Overseas Chinese in other major cities in the Dutch East Indies have also enthusiastically donated money, with no less enthusiasm, such as Surabaya's 2 million yuan, Bandung's 1 million yuan, and the remaining amount donated by overseas Chinese in areas with fewer people. Batavia's largest Chinese newspaper, Sin Po (phonetic translation), has raised 1 million yuan from its subscribers. Due to slight misunderstandings with the East Indies government, Sin Po recently ceased publication for eight days, but the editorial staff took the opportunity to personally visit famous overseas Chinese and raise even more money. Overseas Chinese in Java are actively organizing medical teams to go to the front line of the Chinese army. It is reported that 13 teams have gone to the front line. Although many overseas Chinese are willing to go to the front line in person, they are currently focusing on supplying medicines and medical supplies due to language barriers, and are not eager to send volunteer teams. The Dutch East Indies is a producing area for quinine and other medicines. Overseas Chinese here are actively purchasing medicines and have donated 10 tons of quinine, as it is reported that epidemics are prevalent in the war zone. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>—Sincere and Earnest Words—</p>
<p>Uetaka, April 26th. After the Hua army recaptured Gao'an in April, Saito, a Japanese citizen and political party member, sent a letter to his son. The translation and publication are as follows:</p>
<p>The depths of winter have passed, but the weather is still bitterly cold. I don't know what the situation is like on the battlefield. I trust you are safe. As for the situation in the homeland, it is generally the same as what is recorded in the newspapers that I send you daily. There are no major changes. Your letter said that you asked someone to bring back some items, but they have not been received here. I am notifying you specifically. On January 20th, I sent you a package of慰问品 (comfort goods). The items inside should be carefully inspected and not be known to your companions, lest you be in danger. Your mother and I are both well, and your sister is also healthy. I am very busy every day, and there are many more comrades. The future is very hopeful, so please don't worry. I hope you take care of your health and don't let sickness invade you. I pray to the gods and Buddhas for you morning and evening, asking the Buddha to have great compassion. Mr. Kurabayashi has also been dispatched to North China. I don't know if you will be able to meet. The photo you took on the banks of the Xiu River has been sent to me. I will continue to send you newspapers until you return. I have not seen a single person I know who went to China to participate in the war return home safely. Your sister has been sobbing incessantly since you went to war, and she goes to Yawatan Shrine every day to pray for you. If there is any special news or instructions, I will send them to you immediately. I hope you take care. I want to tell you something very confidential. Saito, during the February 26th Incident, vehemently denounced the warlords in the Diet, causing a sensation at the time. He strongly opposed the war of aggression against China. This letter is beautifully written and easy to read, and it is enough to prove that the people of Japan deeply resent the deployment of troops and the burden on the people, and it sufficiently expresses the emotions of the Japanese people suffering because of the war.

<p>(Chongqing) The League of Nations Executive Council will convene tomorrow. Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui issued a statement here today, again appealing to the League of Nations to urge member states to take the following actions: (1) Take collective action to stop Japan's aggression in China; (2) Stop supplying Japan with military raw materials; (3) Sever financial and trade relations with Japan; (4) Implement the resolutions previously passed by the League of Nations, and please pay attention to the resolution passed on September 9, 1938, condemning the bombing of non-combatants, stating that the Japanese side's continued bombing of undefended cities, causing the deaths and injuries of dozens of civilians, including women and children, is intended to intimidate the Chinese people, but this inhumane behavior only serves to strengthen the Chinese people's determination to resist until the triumph of justice over force.

(Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The 105th session of the League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to open in Geneva on the 22nd of this month. The application submitted by China has been placed on the agenda. The British Aid China Campaign Committee has issued a statement requesting that the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly and the Executive Council, namely, that member states should individually aid China, be immediately implemented. The methods are no more than three: (1) Do not supply Japan with war materials, including aircraft, which should be prohibited from being exported to that country; (2) Boycott Japanese goods, so as to inflict a major blow on the country's economic base in a short period of time; (3) Provide financial and economic assistance to China, so as to build the southwestern provinces, develop the industrial cooperative movement, and relieve refugees in the war zone. The above measures should be adjusted by a committee established by the Executive Council in order to improve efficiency. Recently, some member governments of the League of Nations have stated that they are willing to uphold the collective security system. If the League of Nations Executive Council can effectively assist China, it will be a great contribution to the collective security system. In addition, the United States is also willing to actively participate in aiding China, as can be seen from President Roosevelt's recent words and actions. (Havas telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Although the War in China is Fierce, Efforts to Suppress Opium Continue, Japan Openly Encourages Opium in Occupied Areas, Chinese and American Representatives State at the League of Nations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee on Opium of the League of Nations recently continued to meet today. The Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, Minister to Switzerland, presented a report on the country's government's efforts to ban drugs, stating that the consumption of various narcotics is extremely harmful to the war of resistance, and it is necessary to ban them. Therefore, various effective measures have been taken to stop the sale of opium and heroin, and to reduce the number of opium smokers, hoping that those under the age of 45 who smoke opium will completely quit by 1941. All these measures have been effective and can be formally confirmed by neutral parties. For example, the annual report of the Shanghai International Settlement and the report published by the French government in Vietnam in 1937 are clear evidence. On the contrary, the harm of various drugs in the occupied areas of China is painful to speak of. The Japanese side not only does not prohibit them, but openly encourages them. Taking Shanghai as an example, since the occupation, it has been very different from the past. This can be seen from the report submitted by the Public Concession there last year. There are three objectives by which the Japanese side systematically poisons the Chinese people: a certain Japanese agency can profit from it to allocate funds for aggression; Japanese and Korean ruffians who are not tolerated in Japan are ordered by the Japanese authorities to come to China to sell drugs for a living; and to weaken China's resistance and lure traitors. The American representative, Fuller, spoke next, stating that the Chinese government is still working hard to ban drugs despite the difficult circumstances, which is commendable. Regarding the sale of various narcotics in the occupied areas of China, the U.S. government is still constantly receiving various news, which is very disturbing. The Japanese authorities have not taken effective measures in these areas to cooperate in banning narcotics, but in the view of the U.S. government, the harm of drugs in the Far East can be greatly improved. There are three ways: (1) The Japanese government should strictly order the authorities stationed in the area to prohibit the import of opium into the occupied areas; (2) The quantity of opium shipped from Iran to the Far East seems to have increased rather than decreased recently. The government of that country should immediately take effective measures to prohibit its shipment to the Far East; (3) The Portuguese government should take effective measures to cooperate in preventing the sale of narcotics and not allow Macau Island to become a base for drug trafficking.

<p>(Washington) The U.S. "Commercial Week" opened today. The opening speech written by President Roosevelt was read on his behalf by Secretary of State Hull. It stated, "Maintaining peaceful relations is the ideal of the vast majority of countries in the world. The main goal of American foreign policy is also here. What we hope for and where our goals lie is in peaceful trade, so that normal conditions can be restored." Secretary of State Hull then gave a speech, strongly arguing that the policy of concluding mutual reciprocal trade agreements is beneficial to everyone. "The peace we speak of is peace based on understanding, not peace based on surrendering to superior force. Any attempt to replace fair negotiations with the threat of strong armor and sharp weapons should be stopped. The agreements that countries should establish must ultimately limit armaments and reduce armaments." Once the atmosphere of mutual suspicion between countries is eliminated and satisfactory agreements are established, the true wealth and true enjoyment of all countries in the world will increase accordingly. This is the plan we are promoting, both to do our best and to adapt to our country's position in the world. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>(Washington) It is reported that the Japanese cabinet's five-minister meeting has decided to refuse to participate in the military alliance treaty of Germany and Italy. Regarding this, diplomatic circles here have not received formal news from Tokyo that is credible. However, it is said that Japan will not sign a military alliance with Germany and Italy. From the withdrawal of the Japanese Marine Corps from Gulangyu, it can be seen that the government is unwilling to have friction with the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, so as not to increase difficulties in China. In addition, regarding the issue of protecting American interests in China, if the Japanese government's diplomatic policy has been determined, it is hoped that it will submit a note to the United States to explain its attitude.

<p>(Tokyo) The central members of the Japanese cabinet met yesterday to discuss the attitude that Japan should take towards the European situation. Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, Navy Minister Yonai, and Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro were all present. There are rumors that Japan has decided not to participate in the military treaties of Germany and Italy, but that in the event of war, Japan will adopt a benevolent neutral policy towards Germany and Italy. This is considered to be pure fantasy and not to be believed. Political figures believe that the Japanese government has not yet reached a consensus on the above issues. The military faction and the younger generation all advocate concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy, but the diplomatic faction and party leaders do not think so. They believe that the best policy is to conclude a military alliance with the sole purpose of resisting the Soviet Union. Beyond this scope is not in Japan's interest. (Hai Tong telegram, 21st)</p>

Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately held talks with Ambassador Maisky, informing him of the details of the meeting with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris yesterday. Ambassador Maisky also reported everything to his government by long-distance telephone afterwards. It is generally believed that the agreement between England, France, and the Soviet Union can be announced in a short period of time, but in any case, nothing will be truly decided before the 24th of this month, because any decision must be formally established after the British Cabinet approves it at a meeting on that day. (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, according to the diplomatic correspondent of The Sunday Times, after Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax held talks with French cabinet members in Paris yesterday afternoon, the plan for cooperation between England, France, and the Soviet Union has been negotiated. Its content stipulates that England, France, and the Soviet Union sign a military alliance treaty, but it will only take effect when one of the three signatory countries is attacked. "This plan has distinguished between 'direct' aggression and 'indirect' aggression. Direct aggression refers to an attack on one of England, France, or the Soviet Union. 'Indirect' aggression refers to an attack on any of the countries guaranteed by the three countries. The military alliance treaty to be signed by the three countries is specifically aimed at dealing with direct aggression. In other words, if one of the three signatory countries is directly attacked by another country, the other two countries must immediately send troops to assist. If only indirect aggression is encountered, in other words, if one of the three countries, England, France, and the Soviet Union, guarantees one country, is attacked, and asks the guaranteeing country to send troops to assist, then England, France, and the Soviet Union must provide assistance in an appropriate manner. In this way, on the one hand, the advantages of signing an alliance treaty between England, France, and the Soviet Union can be preserved, and on the other hand, all concerns of the countries concerned who are unwilling to cooperate too closely with the Soviet Union can be eliminated. It can be said to be a win-win situation." (Havas telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The dismissal of Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin from going to Geneva to meet with British and French diplomatic officials is not taken seriously in Moscow. Moscow has never announced this matter. According to popular opinion, Potemkin does not have the authority to make policies, and there is no difference between him and Ambassador Maisky to the United Kingdom, who represents the Soviet Union at the League of Nations. Soviet officials and the Soviet press did not say a word about the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain at the House of Commons on Friday regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. This is probably an indication that the Soviet Supreme Authority has not yet prepared to provide a new counter-proposal. At the same time, well-informed sources believe that Maisky has been instructed to continue negotiations with the British Foreign Secretary in Geneva. The result may be a compromise between British and Soviet differences, which is unknown. (Reuters telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Prime Minister Daladier, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet discussed the entire international situation for two hours at a meeting at the Ministry of the Army last night, paying particular attention to efforts to recruit the Soviet Union into the anti-aggression front. It is reported that this decision has found that the British and French views are completely consistent. British and French diplomatic authorities will continue to talk in Geneva. Before the two sides gathered at the Ministry of the Army for talks, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky had visited Daladier. After French Foreign Minister Bonnet arrived in Geneva, he will discuss with Maisky. The general impression here is that although the talks between the British and French authorities are very satisfactory, an Anglo-Soviet agreement may not be concretely established within a few days. A major understanding will only be reached after the Geneva Conference. However, all sectors of the Soviet Union here hope that an Anglo-Soviet agreement can be established soon (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers commented on the progress of negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, Enterprise, reported, "Last night, the British and French authorities believed that the principles of the Anglo-Soviet agreement were expected to be established in Geneva by the 23rd of this month, and the formal signing of the agreement will be next week. This is also believed in Berlin. The German political police received intelligence on the 19th that the French military authorities had strongly urged the Polish army representative that Poland should be within the scope of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance mechanism on the day it is established, and allow the Soviet Union to assist with all its forces. It is reported that the Polish side has agreed. In addition, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was reportedly ordered by the Führer Hitler to transfer the trend of the establishment of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union and between Poland and the Soviet Union to the Propaganda Department, so as to instill this view in the general public in Germany, so as to avoid panic when hearing the news temporarily. The Communist Party's L'Humanité reported, "Soviet cooperation is necessary for France. Regarding this, the French Foreign Minister should take the British-French consultations as a starting point and explain it to the British government in detail." The right-wing Le Petit Parisien reported, "The Soviet Union has a non-aggression pact with France, and also maintains relations with Turkey. Britain maintains relations with France and has also concluded an agreement with Turkey. This kind of direct and indirect chain relationship is mutually beneficial. Therefore, it is firmly believed that Britain and the Soviet Union will be able to find a way to clear away all the difficulties in the current negotiations at one fell swoop."

Before these negotiations are completed, it is difficult to report them. In addition, France and the United States also maintain closer friendship.

The key is of unusual importance. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is scheduled to come here to hold talks with French government authorities. He will certainly strive to continue efforts to organize an anti-aggression bloc. At the same time, Germany and Italy are scheduled to sign a political and military treaty on the 22nd of this month. From now on, the egoistic principles of these countries in politics will further develop into close cooperation in all aspects, especially in military affairs. These countries are also stepping up the exchange of views with the Japanese government, hoping that Japan will express its attitude before the signing of the political and military treaty between Germany and Italy. The diplomatic circles here believe that Japan's agreement to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact is undoubtedly certain. However, it is uncertain whether it will go a step further and join the political and military treaty between Germany and Italy. Japanese figures here also said that the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan still need to conduct lengthy negotiations, but it is highly doubtful whether Japan will willingly accept substantial restrictions to resist the United Kingdom and the United States. As for Spain, General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, also seems unwilling to sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. At the same time, the United Kingdom and France are sparing no effort in organizing an anti-aggression bloc. The main key lies in whether the Soviet Union will come out to cooperate. If the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union announce the establishment of an agreement, they can effectively restrain the ambitions of the Axis countries. It is reported that the British government will submit a new proposal with a broader scope in accordance with the wishes of the Soviet Union. In this way, it is not impossible for the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement. In addition, certain countries that were previously wary of the Soviet Union have also changed their opinions one after another. Among them, the transformation of Poland is the most significant. In addition, there are still several countries that are hovering between authoritarian and democratic countries, and will not truly join the democratic front until the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are successful. This is the same as the significant impact felt by the Balkan Peninsula countries after the United Kingdom and Turkey agreed on a mutual assistance agreement. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Cuneo When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini arrived here today, tens of thousands of Italian Blackshirt troops shouted, "March on Paris!" Mussolini then addressed the Blackshirts, saying, "Germany and Italy both desire peace, but when necessary, we are prepared to force it by force. The German-Italian united front, with 150 million people, will not be resisted by anyone." After Mussolini finished speaking, the crowd shouted, "We demand the occupation of Nice (in southeastern France, bordering Italy) and Savoy (a province in eastern France, bordering Italy)." Mussolini finally said, "From now on, I will no longer speak. If the facts require it, the Italian people will speak." Regarding the German-Italian Axis, Mussolini pointed out, "This strong axis desires peace, but if the democratic countries attempt to prevent our irresistible desire, we must force it." When Mussolini mentioned the democratic countries, the crowd shouted, "Cowards! Cowards!" Mussolini also asked the crowd to pay attention to the German-Italian alliance to be signed tomorrow. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini of Italy gave a speech yesterday in Cerea, in the Medical District of northern Italy, saying, "After the signing of the German-Italian alliance, it will become an impeccable group of 150 million people. This kind of group is extremely terrifying in name and in strength, and desires peace, but whenever great conservative and reactionary democratic countries want to prevent our irresistible advance, we will force them to have peace. We will not speak for the time being; when the time is right, the Italian people will speak. Italy has 45 million people, including 10 million soldiers, all of one heart and one mind (the crowd shouted). Your voices prove this statement. I have already made it clear in Turin. Today's statement is just a supplement to the previous one. In short, when necessary, the Italian people will speak." Italian Foreign Minister Ciano went to Berlin to sign the alliance tomorrow. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini's short speech in Cuneo, northern Italy, today has been commented on by diplomatic figures here, who believe that the international situation is likely to become serious as a result. This impression can be clearly seen in the article published by the semi-official International Relations News. The newspaper stated that in addition to its demands for Tunis, the Suez Canal, and the port of Gibraltar, Italy should also demand that the provisions of Article 13 of the Secret London Treaty of 1913 be implemented. According to that article, at the end of the European War, the United Kingdom and France should make concessions to Italy on colonial issues. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Radical Socialist Party's "New Era" newspaper recently commented on Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Cuneo. "Since the United Kingdom and France have neither attacked Albania nor eroded the land of other countries, the United Kingdom does not covet the Polish Corridor, and France has not demanded the Italian colony of Libya, Prime Minister Mussolini claims that the German-Italian group wishes for peace and is prepared to force other countries to accept peace. If other countries have not threatened peace, then what is there to force them to accept peace? Could it be that Head of State Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are simply mocking themselves?" The newspaper continues, "The Italian people, witnessing the strength of foreign forces and the grandeur of their military might, are quite uneasy, and they all worry that Italy will be defeated. This is why the Prime Minister has to exaggerate the German-Italian alliance relationship. This can be thought of as a reason." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, accompanied by Undersecretary of the Army and Chief of the Army Staff General Pariani, as well as many senior military officers, arrived here at 11:00 a.m. today. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Brauchitsch, Minister of Aviation General Göring, General Milch representing the Ministry of Aviation, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, and Japanese Ambassador General Oshima, all welcomed them at the station. German and Italian national flags were hung throughout the city. The number of people gathered on the streets was not very large. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop immediately accompanied Foreign Minister Ciano and his party to their residence, and then returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work. Foreign Minister Ciano rested for a while, first went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to lay a wreath, and then went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return the visit of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and held talks for an hour. Then, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to welcome them. The diplomatic authorities of Germany and Italy are scheduled to formally sign the political and military treaty tomorrow. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon, accompanied by Italian Ambassador Attolico, to visit Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, "to continue the talks that had not been completed in Milan, Italy." Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then returned the visit to the Adlon Hotel and hosted a banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Those invited to attend included Italian Undersecretary of the Army General Pariani, Italian Ambassador Attolico, and various German party and government dignitaries. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>Warsaw Serious disturbances occurred again last night on the border between the Free City of Danzig and the German province of East Prussia. Several members of the National Socialist Party gathered in front of the Polish border checkpoint around 8:00 p.m., behaving aggressively and firing several shots. Polish border guards returned fire. At 11:00 p.m., a Danzig city police officer arrived at the scene and advised the border guards to withdraw from the checkpoint, saying that he could not be responsible for ensuring their safety. The border guards then withdrew to the town of Siemianowice to avoid the confrontation. National Socialist Party members immediately destroyed the checkpoint. When Mr. Chodacki, the senior Polish commissioner stationed in the Free City of Danzig, heard the news, he sent Deputy Commissioner Bielski to the scene to investigate. The Free City Senate refused to send police to protect him. Bielski's car was shot at by several Germans. The driver returned fire, killing one German. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Warsaw After the anti-Polish incident in the town of Karosche, on the border between the Free City of Danzig and the German province of East Prussia, the city's people were quite agitated, fearing that other disturbances would follow. Regarding this matter, Chodacki, the Polish High Commissioner stationed in the city, has lodged a protest with the city senate. It is reported that the person who led the attack on the Polish checkpoint in the town was a member of the National Socialist Party named Androu. After the guards withdrew from the checkpoint under threat, the rioters destroyed all the houses and threw the furniture inside onto the street. When Polish Deputy Commissioner Bielski arrived to investigate, his car was also attacked by rioters. The tires and windows were broken. In a moment of desperation, the driver opened fire to resist. According to information obtained here, the Danzig City Senate has taken various emergency measures to ensure local security. However, Polish people believe that this disturbance is actually a provocative act by the Germans, which is enough to hinder the basic rights enjoyed by Poland in the city, that is, the right to manage customs duties. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the disturbance in Karosche, Free City of Danzig, the chairman of the city senate, Gmotze, presented a note to Polish High Commissioner Chodacki, expressing a protest in extremely strong terms, stating that when the disturbance occurred in the town, the car driver Moloski of Polish Deputy Commissioner Bergoski shot and killed citizen Grubbner, which was "outrageous" and could have a serious impact on the current relationship between the City of Danzig and Poland, and requested an immediate investigation to determine responsibility (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Lieutenant General Wither of the German General Staff published an article in the "People's Observer" yesterday, entitled "The Border Defense Project in the East and West of Germany." It is rare to find text about border defense secrets, so people generally passed it around and paid close attention to it. The article briefly stated, "The western border defense of Germany is indestructible and cannot be captured by manpower. Mountainous areas on the border are defended by troops accustomed to mountain warfare. The western defense line is built with layers of defensive works and stationed with elite troops, which can resist any attack. The southern defense line of Germany is also impregnable and can be guaranteed to be safe. As for the eastern defense line of Germany, the key points are Silesia, Pomerania, and East Prussia. The three governments are now conscripting workers to build defensive works. Dr. Todt's highway construction team is now engaged in planning the transportation network, which can be realized in a short period of time. At that time, the eastern defense will not be inferior to the western project. In short, if Poland is truly reckless, Germany's military strength will be victorious. (Haitong Electric, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Head of State Hitler went to the west to inspect the defense works, he returned to the capital this afternoon. (Havas Electric, 20th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia Political figures here stated that the agreement concluded between Turkey and the United Kingdom indicates that Turkey's interests are not limited to the Balkan Peninsula, but will extend to the Mediterranean, and thus the situation in the Balkans has changed. Yugoslav political figures believe that it is urgent for the foreign ministers of Yugoslavia and Romania to have direct contact under such circumstances to discuss whether Turkey's change in policy has actually withdrawn from the Balkan Entente. (Haitong Electric, 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania Foreign Minister Gafencu set off for Turnu Severin this afternoon. At the same time, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovich is also scheduled to travel from his country's capital to the city to discuss the altered policies, and soon they will sail on the Danube River together to conduct talks. As is generally known, this negotiation is of an informational exchange nature. Foreign Minister Gafencu will not only exchange views with the South Country's Foreign Minister in the capacity of Romania's Foreign Minister, but also in the name of the annual chairman of the Standing Political Conference of the Balkan Entente.

Although the Japanese have begun full traffic on the Jinpu Railway, tickets to Pukou have been sold in Tianjin, but no passengers are asking about them. Moreover, this traffic, traveling south from Tianjin, cannot arrive on time. In recent days, the south-bound train is being destroyed from time to time. The travel time on the Pinghan and Pingsui Railways has also been inaccurate recently. It is said that 52 bridges on the Jindong section of the Beining Railway in the eastern Hebei area were once destroyed. (Electric, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Dire Conditions in Inner Mongolia Under Japanese Military Control Commerce and Finance Controlled by Japanese Military Pseudo-Mongol Government Dominated by Japanese Advisors Suiyuan Cities Frequently Attacked by Chinese Army <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News of May 14 reported a communication from Zhangjiakou: In February, a group of foreign journalists, under the leadership of Japanese officials, traveled to Suiyuan Guihua. According to information collected from the newspapers, after these people returned from this trip, they enthusiastically described the pleasant situation in Inner Mongolia. Almost like a second paradise, it was said that the area was peaceful and vast, trade was flourishing, local industry was developed, and the people were extremely happy and satisfied. If the reporters know that the situation there is similar to that of Zhangjiakou here, the reporter is quite surprised by these optimistic news. Therefore, some time ago, he returned from a trip to other towns with curiosity, but what is the basis for this? According to the reporter's observation,</p>
<p>The situation in Inner Mongolia is not only not optimistic, but in fact worse than before the Japanese military invasion. The prosperous export trade on which Guihua's prosperity depended in the past has now completely stopped. The reason is that the caravan roads starting from Gansu and southwestern Xinjiang are completely blocked. The Chinese army front line is only a few miles west of Baotou, the terminus of the Pingsui Railway. In the past, long camel columns slowly traveled along this ancient caravan road, traveling only one and a half miles per hour, carrying leather, wool, and other products from the Far West, and making huge profits. Not to mention the highly profitable opium caravans, all of this has stopped. No caravans now arrive in Baotou or Guihua. Secondly, in the northern Mongolian plains,</p>
<p>Bandits are rampant as before, so Chinese merchants who used to go to Mongolian yurts to buy products no longer risk going to these areas. In fact, the areas where people live have been devastated. Many villages are deserted, and the people are poor and in pain. Much of the land that has already been cultivated is now turned into pasture. On the other hand, the Mongols themselves no longer take their goods to the railway towns for sale, fearing that they will be forced to sell them at low prices set by the government. The only remaining export trade must go through the Mengcang Company. The company is nominally composed of six Mongolian merchants, but in fact it is entirely under</p>
<p>Japanese control and has a complete and absolute monopoly on all export products. Outsiders may not purchase wool, leather, or any other ordinary export items without special permission. When they were in Guihua, several German merchants also arrived in the area. Although they had special permits from the Japanese, they managed to purchase only the smallest amount of needed items after experiencing numerous difficulties, and left with very dissatisfied expressions. In short, the authorities have made it clear that they do not want outsiders to participate, and they are trying everything to prevent outsiders from entering the country. To stay in Inner Mongolia for a slightly longer period, one must obtain a special permit issued by the Japanese military authorities, and now it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain such a certificate. Not long after the establishment of the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," the Mengcang new banknotes began to circulate. However, no one trusts them. Although foreign exchange is strictly restricted and all exports and imports are controlled, the discount for exchanging Mengcang currency for legal tender is very large. As a result, in the past year and a half, all prices have doubled. Although salaries are also higher than before, they have not been able to compensate for the increased cost of living. Local retail commerce is still as good as before, but in addition to stores selling daily necessities, most customers are Japanese soldiers and civilians. In the past, the more wealthy Mongolian men and women flocked to Guihua every year to buy things, crowding the streets, but this is no longer seen. The so-called "foreign goods stores" that they especially liked to patronize have now become "luxury goods" display centers with sluggish business. In the countryside around the area, a lot of opium is planted. It is said that fields planting opium account for one-tenth of the total. This is probably because the supply of opium, which was often transported by caravans, is now being cut off.</p>
<p>The political situation does not seem to be as pleasant as the commercial and financial situation. Mongols and Japanese do not trust each other very much. Although the Mongolian government is nominally autonomous, it is actually dominated by Japanese advisors, and recently even manipulated by Japanese military representatives. The Mongolian princes know that they are in a subordinate position and are very unhappy, but they cannot do anything about it. The thousands of Mongolian troops recruited to fight against the Chinese army and suppress bandits, the so-called "Inner Mongolia Army," are extremely evil. The discipline is nonexistent, let alone combat. The Japanese themselves do not trust them either. These Mongolian troops, whenever they are sent out to suppress bandits, often loot villages and commit the most terrible atrocities, so the people hate them to the bone, even more than the Japanese troops. Because of the uselessness of the Mongolian army,</p>
<p>The regular Chinese army frequently launches attacks on various cities in Suiyuan, directly approaching the city walls without any losses. Sometimes, when the Chinese army waits for the enemy to approach and the Mongolian army sees that the situation is serious, they flee elsewhere. Because both the Japanese and the Mongols are dissatisfied, the reporter was quite nervous when he was in Guihua. Rumors spread throughout the city, saying that the "Mongolian Government" would move elsewhere, that the titular head of the government, Prince De, had already been deposed, and that the "Autonomous Government" would be completely abolished and the area would be under the direct rule of the Japanese military. Whether these rumors will become reality remains to be seen, but some changes will inevitably occur soon. As far as the welfare of the common people of Inner Mongolia is concerned, the current regime has certainly not made any improvements to the areas under its rule. In fact, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the situation there is worse than in early 1937.</p>
<p>In short, there are three reasons: (1) general financial mismanagement; (2) the 90% of the population who are Chinese are as deeply opposed to the Japanese occupation as ever; (3) the Japanese have failed to win the favor and cooperation of the Mongols.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Japanese Troops Invading Guangdong Commit Further Atrocities in Heshan and Gaoming, Reinforcements Continuously Arriving in Guangdong for All Fronts; Chinese Troops in Heshan Mount Highly Successful Counterattacks; Japanese Troops Harass Various Areas of Zhongshan <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch: Over the past week, the Japanese side has been increasing troop deployments to invade Guangdong, having transported them from Taiwan. A portion landed at Humen in Guangzhou and were distributed to the three defense lines of the East River, West River, and North River, as well as to replenish the forces lost in Jiangmen and Hui City. These replacement troops were mostly dispatched from Humen to Rongqi and Guizhou, which belong to Shunde. It is speculated that the Japanese aim is still focused on the southwestern areas of Guangdong Province, while taking a defensive posture on the Northeast River. The West River has strong Chinese military strength and the strategic importance of the Zhaoqing Gorge. Mines are laid along the river to prevent Japanese warships from easily crossing. On land, Chinese troops tightly control the Lubao line, forming a strategic partnership with the Chinese troops on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway in the North River, controlling the Chantan Highway and containing the northwestern suburbs of Guangzhou. Therefore, the Japanese have recently only held Jiangcun on the North River Railway, temporarily connecting with Japanese troops in Huaxian and Conghua. The main force of the Japanese army in the northeast is concentrated in Taipingchang in Conghua, coordinating with the Japanese troops in Zengcheng on the eastern route. Another force is gathered in Longkou Village and Longxiang City in Huaxian, echoing the Japanese troops in Jiangcun. In recent days, patrols from both sides have made contact. In the North River, they are contending between Xin Street and the river. In the West River, the two armies are fighting for the Fengsong area on the Chantan Road. On the East River front, both sides have gained and lost in Fuhexu. Artillery fire occasionally erupts near Zengcheng. Along the West River coast, the two armies are facing each other across the river without major advances. This is a general overview of the recent war situation in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army is taking a defensive position on the northeast fronts, the reinforcements arriving from Taiwan over the past month have mostly been dispatched to Jiangmen and Xinhui, hoping to gather the remnants, invade Heshan and Gaoming, circumvent the southern bank of the West River, and raid Guibian. After being replenished, the Japanese troops in Xinhui suddenly advanced along the Xinhui-Heshan Highway from the 11th to the 12th of this month. They first sent seven or eight aircraft to bomb key points on the highway in the Niushan, Duruan, Pingling, and Jinggen areas. No less than 50 bombs were dropped, but the Chinese troops near Pingling had strong positions and natural defenses. After the Japanese planes bombed at will, the Japanese troops rushed to Jinggen. The Chinese troops suddenly intercepted them, causing the Japanese to panic and flee. However, they were still unwilling to give up and sent 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry to attack the Chinese positions in Jinggen, suffering heavy casualties. Since the Japanese troops on the Xinhui-Heshan Road were unsuccessful, they changed their plan to harass the coast of Heshan by waterway, hoping to support the advance of the Japanese troops on the Xinhui-Heshan Road and flank Heshan, attempting to spy on Gaoming. On the 13th of this month, 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese troops gathered in Jiujiang, along with more than 30 motorboats and a shallow-water warship, patrolling the Jiujiang River Qingyi area. At around 6 a.m. on the 14th, several Japanese aircraft were sent to bomb the positions of the Chinese troops in Gulao and Shaping, which belong to Heshan, to cover the landing of the land forces by motorboat. Six to seven hundred Japanese troops attacked Panbaokang in Shaping. The Chinese troops initially retreated strategically but then launched a fierce counterattack after the Japanese troops landed. The Japanese troops failed to establish a foothold and suffered heavy casualties, forcing them to flee back on their original boats. The Chinese artillery took the opportunity to unleash firepower, firing along Gulao, Heqing, and Shaping. Two Japanese boats were sunk near Panbaokang, and another was sunk off the coast of Shaping, drowning 50 to 60 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army abandoned dozens of corpses on the shore of Shaping, and the Chinese army seized many spoils of war. That evening, the Japanese troops retreated completely back to Jiujiang.</p>
<p>While the Japanese army attempted to attack Heshan and Gaoming again, they also increased their troops in Daliang and other places in Shunde, attempting to invade Zhongshan County. In recent days, more than 30 motorboats have been seen in Rongqi and Guizhou, which belong to Shunde, and Toushan, Yinggezui, and the river surface connected to Zhongshan. Jiuzhou Island on the Zhongshan sea has been occupied by the Japanese army as a supply station. Near Sanzao Island, seven Japanese shallow-water warships have been seen cruising back and forth. On the 12th, they sent marines to land at Hengmen Yongkoumen in Zhongshan, but they were repelled by the Chinese army. On the same day, Xiaohuangpu in the county was also harassed by the Japanese army, and all the local food and hardware were plundered. At night, they fled back to Zhou, which belongs to Shunde. On the 11th, it was also reported that a Japanese plainclothes team was discovered in Nanping Township, the fifth district of the county, but it was fortunately detected and suppressed by the authorities in advance. After the unrest in the above-mentioned areas, the entire county was filled with panic. The county government immediately issued an emergency order to destroy the western section of the highway from Shiqi to Macau. On the 13th, an order was issued again to evacuate the population. For a time, refugees crowded the Qiguan Station, and those going from Qianshan to Macau were endless. Wu Fei, a member of the provincial government, was ordered to arrive in Zhongshan to set up the Sixth Guerrilla Zone. Wu has already taken office as the commander of the Sixth Guerrilla Zone yesterday and convened a county-wide military and political meeting on the 13th to determine a major plan for resisting the war and defending oneself. He then personally went to inspect the defenses of various districts to ensure everything was safe. (May 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Xuzhou: Puppet Troops Revolt, Three Hundred Men Vow to Resist Japan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: Chen Kang, the commander of the puppet army in Xuzhou, was originally a former subordinate of Wu Peifu. The news that the Japanese army had previously agreed to Wu's establishment of a puppet government prompted Chen to take on the puppet post. Recently, Chen has learned that not only has Wu not established a puppet government, but he has also been unmoved by the Japanese army's threats and inducements. Chen, realizing that he had been deceived by the Japanese army, recently tried to resign from his post as commander of the puppet army and disbanded his only puppet army of 300 men. However, the Japanese secret service took over the puppet army and put it under its jurisdiction. Recently, with the guerrilla forces active in the southern part of Xuzhou, the Japanese army drove the puppet army to carry out "mopping up" missions in the three ports of Cao Village in southern Xuzhou. The leader of the local people's self-defense corps, Teng Caihua, used political tactics to make the puppet army revolt and jointly resist the enemy. The puppet army now understands its past mistakes and is willing to jointly resist Japan under Teng's guidance. The reorganization has been completed, and the unit is now strengthening its efforts to strike at the puppet organizations and actively mobilize the masses to sabotage the Jinpu Railway and other highways. The Japanese army's insidious policy of using Chinese to control Chinese has suffered another small setback here.</p>

<p>Philippine Davis Cup players Sanchez and Anbon traveled from the Philippines to the United States to participate in the Davis Cup. Yesterday afternoon, they passed through the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club and were specially invited to give a performance match, totaling three singles and doubles matches, held at the hard court of the French Chamber of Commerce. Five to six hundred Chinese and Western spectators watched, and the Philippine players won all three singles and doubles matches. Although the two had no special or advanced skills, they are young and promising. In particular, Sanchez's victory over Carson was remarkable. The two took the original round boat, Pias, to Japan and then to the United States this morning. The performance results yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Young, Strong, and Skillful</p>
<p>The two are unremarkable in appearance. Anbon is especially thin and small like a child, and it was thought that he was no match for Li Guofan. However, his physical strength is excellent, and his shots are steady. Li's failure was due to his lack of physical strength and stability. In the first few games, they were able to exchange shots, but later Li was exhausted and completely panicked, repeatedly touching the net and flying wildly. Anbon exchanged shots at both corners and volleyed, and was still calm after the match. After three to three in the first set, Li declined sharply, and the situation suddenly changed. Li scored in the second game of the second set. In the match between Sanchez and Carson, Carson dominated the entire court and won 6-2 very easily, but Carson was already showing signs of fatigue in the first set, and his running was not agile. This was probably because the season had just begun. In terms of skill, Carson was better than Sanchez. His volleys and chops were not as good as Carson's, but he was ultimately defeated by the rising young man. Carson gave up in the first set. Sanchez became more and more courageous in the third set. His forehand exchanges were indeed excellent. Carson was already unable to hit the ball with strength, and was only barely able to cope. After Sanchez led 4-1, Carson barely chased to make 4-4. In the tenth game, Sanchez fell to the ground to save the ball, losing the decisive point. Carson chased again to 5-5, and then took the lead at 6-5, but ultimately could not resist Sanchez's fierce shots and lost three consecutive games. In the final doubles match, Carson was already uninterested in fighting. There were not many wonderful shots from Squia. The two Philippine youths were still full of energy. Sanchez's style is quite similar to Qiu Feihai. His forehand is very good, but his hand is weak and he has not developed his other strengths. Both of them are young and will be rising stars in the East in the future.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3 id="e54">Overview of Secondary Education in China (3) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Rewarding Graduation Exams, Focusing on Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education stipulated that the curriculum outline for national secondary schools was not only for the use of national secondary schools, but also applicable to all public and private secondary schools across the country. It ordered various educational departments to formulate implementation measures and instruct all secondary schools to refer to them for implementation. This outline included five items: spiritual training, academic training, physical training, productive labor training, special education, and wartime rear service training. It aimed to add special education to normal education to meet the needs. In August of the same year, it also ordered all secondary schools to increase the teaching hours for music and art courses in junior and senior high schools. These two courses were each two hours per week in junior high school and one hour per week in senior high school to stimulate the spirit of resistance and awaken national consciousness.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the National Education Association decided on various cases of the secondary school curriculum: (1) Junior high school English may be changed to an elective course, and Chinese language, history, geography, labor (mainly housework for girls), or simple vocational courses should be added. (2) History and geography courses should be combined, and local history should account for one-third.</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the formal curriculum standards for junior and senior high schools, the Ministry of Education hired experts to compile standards for science equipment in secondary schools. In the 23rd year of the Republic, it announced the equipment standards for physics and chemistry in junior and senior high schools. In July, it announced the equipment standards for junior high school botany and zoology and senior high school biology, detailing the minimum, maximum, and general standards for the equipment of instruments, medicines, and specimens, as well as the estimated prices of the equipment. In the 25th year of the Republic, it also announced the equipment standards for the industrial arts part of the labor course in junior high schools, detailing the tools and materials needed for gold, wood, bamboo, rattan, soil, and other crafts. In the 24th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board, and the Chinese Cultural Foundation Committee jointly allocated funds and entrusted the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to manufacture 100 sets of domestically produced physics instruments for senior high schools, which were distributed to high schools in various regions at half the price of 300 yuan per set. In the 25th year of the Republic, it was entrusted to the Institute of Physics to continue manufacturing 80 sets of physics instruments for senior high schools, 2,000 sets of physics instruments for junior high schools, 180 sets of chemistry instruments for senior high schools, and 660 sets of chemistry instruments for junior high schools, totaling 200,000 yuan. It was not completed until the end of the 27th year of the Republic. Due to the inconvenience of transportation during the war, they could not be fully allocated to schools, and most of them were stored by the institute, which would be adjusted and distributed later. After that, the institute was still entrusted to continue manufacturing, but on the one hand, it planned to raise funds to set up a factory in a suitable location in the southwest to manufacture domestically produced instruments to enrich the science equipment of secondary schools across the country and increase the efficiency of education.</p>
<p>Graduation Exams</p>
<p>The regulations on the graduation exams for public and private primary and secondary schools in the 21st year of the Republic stipulated the subjects and methods, ordering that students from secondary schools who did not pass the entrance exam would not be allowed to register for universities. Various provinces and cities held entrance exams. In the 22nd year of the Republic, the primary school graduation exam was abolished, and the secondary school graduation exam regulations were promulgated, abolishing the school graduation exam to reduce the number of exams in the last semester. There were better revisions to the scoring, calculation of grades, and announcement of the names of passing students, and the secondary school graduation exam committee regulations were promulgated to strictly organize the committee. In the 24th year of the Republic, the regulations were revised and promulgated, and the number of entrance exam subjects was appropriately reduced. The method of calculating the grades of each subject of the graduation exam was determined, and the grades of each subject of the school were also included in the calculation, accounting for 40%, and the entrance exam grades accounted for 60%. In the 25th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education reissued a notice to change the entrance exam subjects and stipulated: (1) The ranking of each student should be arranged according to the total average of their graduation grades in each subject. The calculation method of this total average is the sum of the grades of each subject in the entrance exam and the grades of each subject outside the entrance exam, divided by the sum of the number of subjects in the entrance exam and the number of subjects outside the entrance exam. (2) Only the list of schools participating in the entrance exam needs to be published, and the school grades do not need to be calculated according to student grades. (3) The junior high school entrance exam in each province and city may be held in more places than before. (4) The conduct and physical education grades of the school must also be strictly assessed, and they must not be allowed to participate in the entrance exam simply because their academic grades are still passable. In the summer of the 27th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education, due to the spread of the war, found it difficult for various provinces to hold entrance exams, and stipulated the entrance exam method. All provinces that have become war zones are temporarily exempt from holding entrance exams. The provinces near the war zones will have members of the Education Department sent to the schools to supervise the exams, while the provinces in the rear will still hold entrance exams. In the 28th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education, in accordance with the Scholarship Regulations for Chairman Lin's 70th Birthday, used cash to reward the students in each province who achieved excellent results in mathematics, physics, and chemistry in the graduation exams, one student in each subject, and the top two students with excellent average grades in order to encourage them.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Connection Between Law and Economics <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Ying</p>
<p>In modern times, humanity relies on economic strength to build wealthy and powerful nations and prosperous markets. While this is partly due to natural trends, it also depends on the completeness of the law, which has led to this rapid progress. If a nation's economic structure lacks legal support, it is like a rudderless ship, unable to navigate and reach its destination. Conversely, if the law is divorced from economics, there is no need for its creation. They are mutually causative and resultant, and the two contain inseparable and complex functions.</p>
<p>European and American economies have long embarked on the path of capitalism. To this day, they have reached their peak. Therefore, European and American countries, purely to cooperate with this economic system, have created many property laws and property protection laws to seek trade security and asset development. To follow the trend, our country must catch up and strive for self-renewal. However, due to various factors, the economic aspect is limited to coastal trading ports and a few cities, which have a roughly a structure, but are also biased towards consumption. As for production, it is still in its infancy. Other towns and villages still maintain our country's inherent way of life, with no modern economy to speak of.</p>
<p>Understanding this, one must know that although our country's civil and commercial laws are modeled after Europe and the United States, our country's economy is far behind them. Therefore, when put into practice, it is inevitable that there will be ridicule of a "maidservant imitating her mistress," and there is also the risk of focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other. This is because our country is under the oppression of foreign economies, and its foundation is exceptionally weak. Although there are emerging industries, they are just entering the front door of capitalism and have not yet been fully integrated. If the content of the law is too capitalistic, the welfare of the working masses will inevitably be completely exploited and will become increasingly impoverished, which is a hidden worry for our country. For example, the "rent increase problem" worried about by Mr. Yu Zhongluo and Mr. Zong Meng's "malpractice of imbalance between emotion and law" are all related to the livelihood of Shanghai's people. Although the current situation in Shanghai is unique due to the increasing number of residents who have come to Shanghai to escape the war, it is still different from the usual situation. However, the housing problem of the poor, when faced with the oppression of landlords, cannot be legally resolved, which shows that the factors of mismatch between law and economics have been fully manifested. It should be known that in European and American countries, the high price of housing is due to the development of industry and commerce, the gathering of political population, and the rise in living standards. However, the residents of Shanghai come here to escape the war, not only are they short of funds, but they are also mostly unemployed and have no access to loans. Their daily life is more difficult than usual, and their eyes are all falling. And the rich in general only care about their own interests, and they all use capitalistic laws to attack the poor. Although it concerns morality, it is also justifiable. In terms of human feelings, who would be willing to generously give up their own interests to be such a foolish fool who reverses the benefits? The so-called special environment of Shanghai can be said to be all special. On the one hand, the poor commit suicide, and on the other hand, second-hand tenants still oppress third-hand tenants, and other aspects of unscrupulous merchants still hoard and raise rice prices. Gold is the root of all evil, and it has exhausted the cruelty of the world—. Now, Mr. Yu Zhongluo wants to use social opinion to condemn the rich for their unrighteousness. Although this can alleviate the deficiencies of the law, it still depends on their character, and only good people can endure the end of their words. Otherwise, they will act perversely and stubbornly, and it will be difficult to subtly change them. Now, to treat the symptoms in an emergency, it is better to appeal to the authorities. If they can quickly promulgate a relief law to protect the lives of the general poor, and on the other hand, they must also rely on wise judges to consider the general economy in each case. It would be a great blessing if the majority of the poor were not suffocated by the difficulties of life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the general public should be able to organize themselves with a sense of the masses to promote the modernization of the law. In order to improve the economy with "nation-building," complete the legal structure of the entire people. In general, there should be no defects, and it should also be able to conform to the principles of human feelings and benefit the people's livelihood. It is not far away. However, is it evil or not? I hope the legislative authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Mediation of Cases Should Not Lose the Spirit of Summary Procedure <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zuoliang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Qu Yue's article in last week's issue on how to make mediation effective, regarding the hope that the court will improve the mediation methods, it is both thorough and detailed. I think there is still something to add, that is, when mediation cases proceed to litigation, they should not lose the spirit of summary procedure. According to the Civil Procedure Law, there are provisions for summary procedure and non-summary procedure (i.e., local cases). For non-summary cases, the delivery of summons for the date of oral argument should be at least ten days, and the trial period (Article 251 of the Civil Procedure Law) for summary cases is shortened to five days, and the facts and reasons in the judgment can only be recorded in essence (Articles 427 and 432 of the Civil Procedure Law), which is sufficient to show the legislative intent. Summary cases strive for quick and easy conclusion of cases to benefit the litigants. As for the provisions on requesting the court to mediate before filing a lawsuit (Article 409 of the Civil Procedure Law), its purpose is also to be quick and easy, so the mediation establishment has the same effect as settlement in litigation (Article 421 of the Civil Procedure Law), and it is not considered more solemn than local cases. Local cases do not need to go through mediation, while summary cases must go through this mandatory mediation. Moreover, according to Article 409, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Civil Procedure Law, if the nature of the legal relationship and the circumstances of the parties concerned can be considered that there is no hope of mediation, a lawsuit may be filed directly without mediation. Also, according to Article 419 of the Civil Procedure Law, if both parties in the mediation are present and the mediation fails, the argument for litigation may be made at the request of one party, especially for mediation cases. Although the court must mediate, under special circumstances, it is still possible not to apply for mediation, and if both parties are present and the mediation fails, the argument for litigation may be made immediately, which is more significant that the spirit of quick conclusion of summary procedure is not lost. Now, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, for summary cases, does not ask whether the parties have declared that there is no hope of mediation due to special circumstances, and directly files a lawsuit, and the court forcibly mediates all cases. The applicant who is present will be ordered to pay an additional mediation application fee of one yuan and five cents. (Applicants who are not present can be spared) If the mediation fails, the court will re-file the case and set a date for trial. By the time of judgment and execution, calculating the period, it takes two weeks from the filing of the lawsuit to the trial mediation. From the failure of the mediation to the filing of the case for trial, it often takes a month. From the delivery of the judgment to the final execution, it takes two months. Generally, for a summary case, from the filing of the lawsuit to the execution, it often takes more than three or four months (referring to those who have been confirmed in the first instance), which is more complicated than the conclusion of a local case. According to the reason, the court of the first special court applies the mandatory provisions of Article 409 of the Civil Procedure Law to the mediation of summary cases. However, the court of the first special court does not apply the provisions of Article 409, Paragraph 1, Item 5 and Article 419 of the Civil Procedure Law regarding the points that a lawsuit may be filed directly without mediation and that both parties present may make an argument for litigation. As a result, the complexity and speed of the case are actually opposite to the result of local cases, as if they have exchanged positions. Is this something that the original legislative intent could have predicted? Insiders said that the reason why the second special court must forcibly mediate all cases, regardless of whether the parties have applied for hope of mediation, is that the court's legal income is less, so it has to resort to this to seek relief. As for not allowing the two parties to argue for litigation, it is because the judges handling the mediation and the judges handling the litigation are divided into two groups, so another case must be filed. However, this is not without a way to correct it. If it is for mandatory mediation due to legal income, the court may order the receiving office to collect an additional mediation application fee of one yuan and five cents at the time of filing the lawsuit for those who file a lawsuit directly without mediation, and allocate the mediation and litigation trial together. The same judge will handle them separately at the same time. As for when the two parties are present, if one party applies for an argument for litigation, the judge handling the case may directly handle the litigation trial. If it is considered that there is a time relationship for the trial, it may be possible to increase the number of court clerks and reduce the number of cases to provide relief. If so, in summary cases, the spirit of summary procedure will not be lost, and the provisions of Article 409, Paragraph 1, Item 5 and Article 419 of the Civil Procedure Law will not be deliberately omitted and not applied again. This is what I hope that the authorities will improve and correct.</p>
<p>Summary of Judgments</p>
<p>(Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court)</p>
<p>When the court's verification of handwriting is sufficient for a judgment, it shall base its judgment on its own discretion, and it shall not be deemed inappropriate even if the appraisal procedure is not implemented. (Hu Shangzi No. 108 of the 27th Year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>1.

<p>The Shandong High Court submitted a request for interpretation regarding the litigation costs of Teng County. The Judicial Yuan issued Instruction No. 1842 (February 3, 28th Year of the Republic of China), stating: "For the judgment of loss of a lawsuit brought by parents for their minor children to terminate a marriage engagement with others, the execution of the litigation costs may be carried out against the parents only if the parents are the parties to the lawsuit listed in the judgment. If they are only listed as legal representatives, the execution shall not be carried out against the property of the legal representatives regardless of whether their children have private property."</p>

<p>The Jiangsu High Court submitted a request for interpretation regarding the method of calculating appeal benefits for disputes over easement rights. The Judicial Yuan issued Instruction No. 1830 (December 31, 27th Year of the Republic of China), stating: "When filing an appeal due to an easement right lawsuit, regardless of whether the appellant is the easement right holder or the owner of the serving land, and regardless of the claims of the opposing party, the calculation of the appeal benefits shall be based on the amount of the increase in the value of the dominant land due to the assertion of the easement right by one party or the amount of the reduction in the value of the serving land due to the denial of the easement right. Also, for a lawsuit in which the plaintiff requests the defendant to return the land and demolish the buildings on the land or cut down the trees, regardless of which party files the appeal, the standard for calculating the appeal benefits shall be based on the active or passive benefits obtained by winning the lawsuit according to the portion of the judgment that is requested to be changed."</p>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(Question) A has a daughter who, at the age of three, was adopted by C through the introduction of B. After A died, C and the daughter agreed not to interact with A's family. Can they be approached to negotiate? (Hansheng)</p>
<p>(Answer) Since A's daughter has been adopted by C, she no longer has kinship with A's family and cannot be forced to interact with them. (Feng Meixue)</p>
<p>(Question) The divorce document states that the child is to be raised by the woman, and it is noted that education and other expenses are included in the alimony. Is the man's responsibility over? What can I do if I don't want this child? (Lu Renjie)</p>
<p>(Answer) Since there is an agreement between the parties, it should be handled in accordance with the agreement. However, there is a blood relationship between father and son, which cannot be severed by law. If one party cannot maintain a livelihood and has no ability to earn a living, the other party shall still be responsible for support. (Feng Meixue)</p>
<p>(Question) A certain lady lost her parents early and was betrothed by her relatives, but without the lady's permission. Is it legally valid? (Luo Xin)</p>
<p>(Answer) It is legally invalid. However, this is not the case if the lady ratifies it. (Feng Meixue)</p>
<p>(Question) A borrowed 5,000 yuan from B in the 25th year of the Republic of China, using land and houses in the concession as collateral, and there was a written pledge stating "the term is two years, if it is not repaid upon expiration, let someone (i.e., B) sell it by auction, without going through court procedures." Now that A has not repaid it upon expiration, can B sell it by auction after publishing it in the newspaper? Is this kind of special agreement valid? (Ding Yu)</p>
<p>(Answer) It is not legal to publish and sell it by auction on your own. You can only apply to the court for auction. (Yi)</p>
<p>(Question) A is from Jiangsu. More than ten years ago, because of disagreement with his wife, he came to Shanghai in anger and said that he would never return to Jiangsu, but the relationship between father and son has not broken down. After the August 13th Incident, A lost his job and his life became increasingly difficult. He borrowed 100 yuan from B, which has not been repaid. Recently, he wanted to return to Jiangsu, but his wife firmly refused. Although his son interceded, it was also ineffective. Recently, A was reported missing, then (1) Can the debt owed to B be demanded from his son? (2) Because of kinship, no interest is calculated, and there is no written note or witness. Can his son refuse to acknowledge it? (3) If his son denies it, what is the appropriate way to deal with it? (Cao Weiqing)</p>
<p>(Answer) Although A was reported missing, before he is declared dead in accordance with the law and his son inherits, the son is not responsible for repaying his father's debt. As for the loan without a written note or witness, it is not invalid, but when there is a dispute over the truth of the facts, the creditor should prove the truth of his claim, otherwise it is difficult to recognize that his claim exists. (Tong)</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Sun Jilong The questions in your letter are without standards, so it is impossible to answer them. It is better to read more publications about legal knowledge and discuss with those who are familiar with the law when things happen. (Editor)</p>
<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e62">Different Interpretations of Good and Evil <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— (Yuan Yong)</p>
<p>What is called good? What is called evil? Everyone understands. However, good faith and bad faith in law are not explained in this way. If you don't know the circumstances, it is called good faith, and if you deliberately do something, it is called bad faith. The two words good and evil are also very clear. However, there are now very many distorted principles. Clearly an invasion is said to maintain a certain new order, and clearly a massacre is said to be unseen and unknown. Alas—good is what is good, and evil is what is evil. Is there still right and wrong in the world?</p>
<p>Research and Criticism</p>
<h3 id="e63">Victims in Private Prosecution Procedures <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhongluo</p>
<p>Article 337 of the old Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that the victim may file a private prosecution directly with the court with jurisdiction, and Article 311 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that the victim may file a private prosecution, both show that the subject of the right of private prosecution is the victim of the crime. However, the old law did not set a restriction that the victim must have the capacity to act, while the new law is attached with a proviso. Therefore, according to the result of comparative interpretation, if the victim of the old law is a person without the capacity to act, or a person with limited capacity to act, the exercise of the right of private prosecution may be carried out by his legal representative. (That is, the legal representative acts as the plaintiff in the name of the victim, and the legal representative conducts the litigation act.) If the victim of the new law does not have the capacity to act, he is not recognized as the subject of the right of private prosecution, and therefore there is no legal representative who can file a private prosecution on his behalf. Also, according to the illustration of Article 338 of the Bu Law, in addition to the victim, the following persons may be the plaintiff in a private prosecution:</p>
<p>1. Legal representatives, guardians, and spouses of the victim.</p>
<p>2. Relatives of the victim. Those who have the status of (1) file a private prosecution in their own name and are not bound by the wishes of the victim, which is called an independent private prosecution. Those who have the status of (2) may file a private prosecution only after the victim has died, but may not violate the express wishes of the victim. Exploring the legislative intent, it is appropriate to allow those who have the status of (1) to independently file a prosecution in the original public prosecution (Article 214, Paragraph 1 of the old law), and it is also appropriate to allow them to independently file a private prosecution in the private prosecution. Those who have the status of (2) are allowed to file a prosecution after the victim has died, without violating the express wishes of the victim, which is also a provision that corresponds to Article 214, Paragraph 2 of the old law. All of them seek to protect the interests of the victim in a thorough manner. The new law is said to expand the scope of private prosecution, but it strictly restricts the subject of the right of private prosecution, which must be exercised by the victim who has the capacity to act. It not only does not allow the legal representative to file a private prosecution on his behalf, but also deletes the provisions of the old law on independent private prosecution and the private prosecution filed by relatives after the victim's death without violating his express wishes. Therefore, even if it is a crime that is prosecuted upon complaint, if the victim does not have the capacity to act in civil law, his legal representative cannot file a private prosecution, and he must file a complaint in accordance with the public prosecution procedure before he can be investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor. The scope of private prosecution has been relaxed, but the opportunity for victims to use the private prosecution procedure for protection is narrower than in the old law. Isn't it a contradiction for the legislator to say that restricting people other than the victim from filing a private prosecution is to prevent the abuse of fraud and extortion? Then why does the public prosecution procedure still set up independent prosecution and the provisions for allowing those who file a prosecution after the victim's death? The spirit of the legislator is not consistent, which is especially obvious.</p>
<p>What is described above is only the victim of a natural person. Furthermore, when it comes to legal persons, although Article 26 of the current Civil Law states that they have the capacity to enjoy rights and bear obligations within the restrictions of laws and regulations, it does not expressly state that they have the capacity to act. The Code of Criminal Procedure does not have the same provision as the Code of Civil Procedure that "those who can independently bear obligations for legal acts have the capacity to litigate," so it is not recognized that legal persons have the capacity to act. If they do not have the capacity to act, then when a legal person is a victim due to a crime, it should be restricted by the proviso of Article 311 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, and they should not be allowed to file a private prosecution. Also, because the new law does not have the same provision as the old law for the legal representative to independently file a private prosecution, the representative of the legal person should also be interpreted as having no right to file a private prosecution. However, the so-called victim in Article 311 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure will be limited to natural persons. However, the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan is to expressly state that when a legal person is a victim, its representative may file a private prosecution, and it still maintains the meaning of "the plaintiff in a private prosecution is limited to a natural person or a legal person" when it was applied in the old Code of Criminal Procedure, or it also feels that the restriction of the new law is inappropriate, and it has to use this judicial interpretation to try to save it in application? The number and date of the new and old interpretations of this problem are attached below for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e65">How Does the Happiness of Married Life Affect the Body and Mind? <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Many men and women have changed completely after marriage. This change naturally has both good and bad aspects: In the good aspects, for example, a lazy man before marriage will become very diligent and thrifty after marriage, and those who are physically weak will also become healthy. In the bad aspects, there are often young people who were handsome and enterprising before marriage, but suddenly become decadent after marriage, and those who are strong become weak, and even find various morbidities in their body and mind, which can be completely different from before. What is the reason for this? It is the result of the influence of married life on the body and mind.</p>
<p>Happiness is the food of our spirit, which is enough to encourage us to move forward. Health is the power of our body, which supports our work all day long. However, a sound mind resides in a sound body, and the two are closely related and inseparable.</p>
<p>A vigorous and healthy man marries a satisfactory wife, or a beautiful and graceful girl marries a satisfactory husband. They will inevitably live a happy life in the atmosphere of love, giving birth to sons and daughters, and forming a happy family. Because the body and mind are mutually comforted, mutually considerate, and mutually cherished, health will inevitably improve, the spirit will be happy, and the future will be full of optimism. Optimism leads to progress, and progress leads to success. However, if a husband suffers from premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, underdevelopment, thin sperm, infertility, neurasthenia, etc., or marries a wife who is breastless, has a sallow complexion, and has irregular menstruation, their married life will not be coordinated and reach perfection. We know that the satisfaction of sexual life between couples is the only element that maintains their love. Imagine a beautiful girl marrying a sick husband, then the married life will not be perfect, and the precious years will be wasted, which is how painful it is for her! Because of her dissatisfaction and unhappiness, various tragedies are staged in the family! In the end, the weak husband or the weak wife will inevitably suffer the consequences! Therefore, if you want to seek the perfection of married life, good health is the only important thing. However, for husbands who have already suffered from the above-mentioned morbidities, it is not difficult to seek remedy in today's world of medical advancement. The only treatment is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish nerves, and promote the development of function and vigorous metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms can be cured fundamentally. If you continue to take it, you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, reversing aging and returning to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himitoto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" (available at Wuzhou Pharmacy) to consolidate the sperm barrier and prevent spermatorrhea. By using both the treatment of symptoms and the treatment of root causes, the effect will be more rapid. According to the millions of cases of famous doctors in the world and my many years of experience at home and abroad, it is recognized that this method is the most effective for the treatment of the above-mentioned symptoms, so I dare to introduce it to the patients. I hope that you will appreciate this hard work!</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Sorrow of Shrivelled Breasts! <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Recently, Ms. Shen from the Beishijiazhai of Dunxin Road wrote to say that her body was not very strong, and because she often wore small vests during development, a pair of breasts in front of her chest were not fully developed and perfect. Although they are not necessarily flat, they only have two small and slightly protruding prototypes. It is impossible to talk about being high and elastic, so after she got married, although her face was still quite beautiful, she could not win her husband's favor. Recently, three months ago, due to miscarriage and ill health, the breasts that were not very high were even more shrivelled. They are as flat as a man's, so her husband became even more indifferent to her, and sometimes he did not return home all night. She repeatedly advised him gently, but her husband turned a deaf ear. She reasoned with him sternly. He was more fierce than her! She said how affectionate other people's husbands were to their wives? He said why other people's women were all full-breasted and plump-hipped, and their flesh was touching. Why are you shrivelled and ugly, and have nothing touching. She was so angry that she could not answer, and she washed her face with tears every day, complaining about herself! A few days ago, she happened to see modern medicine at the home of her former classmate Ms. Song Qi, and she wrote to the editor of this journal to inquire about remedies.</p>
<p>There are naturally too many things like this in today's society, but this kind of defect is not irreparable. According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologists and others, it is universally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Hormone" for women is the most effective for the symptoms. The main reason for the shrivelled breasts is the dysfunction of the reproductive gland, the ovary. Taking the "Reproductive Hormone" for women prepared with the essence of the ovaries of young animals will naturally have a significant effect in a short period of time. If you continue to take it, not only can it make the shrivelled breasts higher day by day, but it can also regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, promote metabolism, increase vitality, make the face ruddy, and maintain youth.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Crisis of Nocturnal Emission in Scorching Summer <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— By Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Although it is only early summer now, scorching summer will arrive in an instant. When the fiery sun hangs high and the heat is steaming, if one suffers from nocturnal emission, not only will the symptoms worsen, and the number of nocturnal emissions increase, but it may even lead to spermatorrhea and semen leakage if left untreated. Therefore, if nocturnal emission can be thoroughly treated in early summer, not only will less vital energy be lost in the body, but treatment will also be easier. This is truly a worthwhile approach.</p>
<p>The essence in our human body is the source of our life. Not only does it control the development of our appearance and weight, but it can also regulate metabolism and nourish the nerves of various parts of the body. If excessive seminal fluid is lost due to nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, or semen leakage, symptoms such as brain fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, anxiety, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, and mental fatigue will follow. At the same time, developmental functions stagnate, and metabolism decreases, leading to unattractive appearance, local underdevelopment, sallow complexion, emaciation, and premature aging. If such men are in the scorching summer, they often suffer from brain distension and headaches. How can students manage to take supplementary lessons during the summer vacation? Similarly, young people in the workforce are overwhelmed by work every day, simply unable to cope. If things go wrong, some may even succumb to illness during the summer and autumn when epidemics are rampant, which is not uncommon. In short, the future of such young people is bleak, and their happiness is lost! To seek remedy, the disease must be treated fundamentally. The most reliable and effective treatment for nocturnal emission at this time is to take "Hemi-Todes' Sperm-Solidifying Pills". This medicine can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce nocturnal dreams, and promote restful sleep, thereby curing nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotropin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, promote developmental functions, and invigorate metabolism. Then the above-mentioned symptoms will surely disappear completely in a short period of time, and the body can become healthier, achieving the effect of prolonging life. If patients can personally come to our clinic for diagnosis by a specialist doctor, and then use electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other symptomatic treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Why Does Gonorrhea Tend to Recur? <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Experienced clinicians will strive to completely cure patients suffering from gonorrhea, and will never abandon their sacred responsibility midway. They will not use aggressive drugs, clumsy surgery, or improper treatments to forcibly suppress the condition, which may lead to future problems.</p>
<p>For example, during the acute stage of gonorrhea, some doctors, in order to gain the patient's trust, may use strong washing methods or aggressive drugs. As a result, the discharge of pus temporarily stops, the urine becomes clear, or only two or three drops of discharge are seen during urination. At this time, the doctor often tells the patient that the disease is completely cured and no further treatment is needed. However, many patients often relapse within a few days of returning home. It should be understood that the pathogens of gonorrhea not only multiply on the entire surface of the mucous membrane, but also often penetrate deep into the mucous membrane or spread to adjacent accessory organs, where they re-establish foci of infection. Therefore, even if strong washing medicines are used and the surface symptoms of the mucous membrane are luckily cured, the adjacent accessory organs will relapse. It should be understood that the presence of gonorrhea in the urine indicates that it is not completely cured. Even if the urine appears clear to the naked eye, it cannot be determined that it is cured.</p>
<p>To avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks, only the combined use of German Filtrin Direct Current Electrotherapy and ultra-specialized chemical therapy can rapidly eliminate gonorrhea. Filtrin Direct Current Electrotherapy has a broad and deep powerful bactericidal effect and can clarify its toxins. Combined with ultra-specialized therapy and agile, painless surgery, the bactericidal power will be thorough and the toxins will be clarified. In that case, once cured, there will be no recurrence.

<h3 id="e69">Japanese Perceptions of Measures in the Concession: Several Different Feelings, New Developments Expected After Miura's Return to Shanghai, Japan and Jewish Aiming to Establish Peace as a Slogan <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Embassy Expresses Approval</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, when meeting with reporters yesterday (the 20th), fully agreed with the actions taken by the Public Works Bureau last week to deal with anti-Japanese instigators. He referred to the announcement of the ban on political groups, the order for a general search on Thursday evening and Friday morning, and the actions taken against foreign-owned Chinese newspapers as "steps in the right direction." However, the spokesman indicated that matters had not yet completely satisfied the Japanese side. He stated, "We are far from completely satisfied, but we recognize these steps as expressions of the Public Works Bureau's goodwill in meeting Japanese demands." The Japanese military spokesman added that the Japanese Army authorities were also pleased. The Embassy spokesman continued that several issues, including the issue of Chinese flags in the county and court disputes, remained to be resolved.</p>
<p>Japanese Reporter Deems Anti-Japanese</p>
<p>The China Press reports that, according to a Tokyo dispatch from the Toho News Agency, the Shanghai correspondent of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun telegraphed Tokyo on the 20th of this month, stating that Japanese officials in Shanghai increasingly believe that Japan will be forced to take unilateral action to implement its policies in the International Settlement. The correspondent predicted that the situation would undergo new developments after the return of Japanese Consul General Miura to Shanghai. Miura is currently in Tokyo, discussing everything with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and is expected to return to Shanghai on the 27th of this month. The correspondent also stated that the mobilization of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Public Works Bureau police force on Friday, ostensibly to curb terrorism, was in fact a form of anti-Japanese demonstration. This situation, coupled with the rejection by Britain and the United States of Japan's proposals to amend the regulations governing land in the International Settlement, makes it feel that it is extremely difficult to achieve the reorganization of the Public Works Bureau through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>Miura States Establishing Peace According to the China Press, a special Tokyo correspondent's airmail letter was also published yesterday, recounting a conversation with Kawai, spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kawai elaborated on the need to reorganize the Public Works Bureau to adapt to the new needs of today in order to ensure the smooth operation of the administrative organs of the International Settlement. His writing was lengthy and largely similar to the Japanese government's statements to British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, and American Ambassador Grew, so it will not be repeated. In the letter, the correspondent also stated that Japanese Consul General Miura, currently in Japan, recently said to a person, "Some British and American expatriates in Shanghai seem to think that Japan will eventually use force to solve the settlement issue, but we are determined to establish lasting peace in the Far East. Therefore, the reorganization of the International Settlement should be implemented in accordance with this basic policy." Miura also mentioned the issue of the French Concession in Shanghai, saying that the solution to this problem is relatively easy, the most important thing being the courts in the French Concession. The problem with the French Concession only requires dealing with one country, while the International Settlement involves many countries, so it is more complicated.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Hana Maru Liner Suspends Service in Shanghai, Shanghai-Dinghai and Ningbo-Dinghai Routes Resume Smoothly <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>After the resumption of the Shanghai-Ningbo route, there were problems with the Shanghai-Dinghai route, but the Ningbo-Dinghai route has been successfully resumed. A Datong News Agency reporter recorded the actual situation as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Route</p>
<p>After the Lihe Shipping Department's Moufu Wheel successfully sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo the day before yesterday, the Sino-Italian Consalia Wheel was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday. However, due to the bombing of Ningbo, stevedores loading and unloading goods at the dock have to return to the city to work at night, so the wheel was rescheduled to depart at 4:00 AM this morning, arriving in Ningbo by evening. The Deping Wheel has departed from Wenzhou and is en route to Shanghai, arriving today and departing for Ningbo tomorrow. If time is not sufficient, it will be postponed to the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>Ningbo-Dinghai Route</p>
<p>After the Far East Hana Maru Liner and the Lu Lin Gaodeng Wheel successively sailed to Dinghai on the 19th, both wheels arrived in Dinghai on the morning of the 20th. The Hana Maru Liner left Dinghai at 4:00 PM yesterday, carrying passengers and cargo, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 AM today. The Gaodeng Wheel stayed in Dinghai for one day, and resumed service to Ningbo for the first time at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The journey was very smooth, and the ship arrived safely in Ningbo at 2:00 PM. The wheel is scheduled to depart from Ningbo to Dinghai again today, and will routinely operate on the Ningbo-Dinghai route from now on.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dinghai Route</p>
<p>According to information received by the Datong News Agency reporter, the Hana Maru Liner will temporarily suspend service on the Shanghai-Dinghai route after returning to Shanghai from Dinghai. It is likely to be reassigned to Wenzhou. The wheel's authorities have not provided a reason for the suspension. Therefore, the resumption of shipping to Shanghai-Dinghai has been short lived and will apparently be suspended again. It is also rumored that the Taikoo New Beijing Wheel will sail to Ningbo today, but this is inaccurate, as the wheel is currently in Tianjin.</p>

<p>The "Central China Silk Company" originally intended to control the spring cocoons in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, prohibiting Shanghai silk factories from purchasing them. However, due to the guerrillas destroying the cocoon shops everywhere, the Company, realizing the difficulty of controlling cocoon shops in townships, and after strenuous efforts by Shanghai silk factories, agreed to abandon the control of cocoon shops in townships, allowing Shanghai factories to purchase freely. Shanghai factories are now going to various townships to set up shops for purchase, and have prepared certificates from the Shanghai Silk Manufacturers' Association. However, the cocoons purchased must be taxed to the "Renovation Government" before they are allowed to be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Poor Native Harvest, Improved Cocoons are Still Good</p>
<p>Native cocoons from Hangzhou, Haining, Jiaxing, Deqing, and other counties in Zhejiang have been put on the market. The price in Hangzhou is 42 yuan (national currency) per dan (18 tael balance). The price of the best native cocoons in Changan, Haining is 45 yuan (national currency) per dan. However, due to weather conditions, the harvest of native cocoons in various counties of Zhejiang Province this year has been about 30% lower. As for the improved varieties, they will soon enter the scene and are expected to have a better harvest. Because the weather has been very good in recent days, it is suitable for improved varieties to form cocoons. It is said that improved varieties in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang, and other places in Jiangsu are scheduled to appear on the market at the end of this month or early next month.</p>
<p>Shanghai Factories Waiting for Cocoons to Start Operations</p>
<p>There are approximately 45 silk factories in the Shanghai concession. Due to the lack of raw materials, they have been forced to stop work one after another. As of yesterday, only a few factories, such as Jardine, were barely maintaining operations. Regarding the purchase of cocoons from the occupied areas this year, although silver shops have stopped lending tortoise money and insurance companies have stopped insuring various risks, in order to avoid running out of raw materials, they still risk buying from the occupied areas. It has now been decided that operations will resume as soon as the new cocoons arrive in Shanghai, and it has been decided that day and night shifts will be worked to rush the silk reeling. It is expected that after the spring cocoons are put on the market, the number of silk factories in Shanghai will increase to more than 50.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons from Eastern Zhejiang Approved for Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Xinchang, Shengxian, Zhuji, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang are also the only cocoon-producing areas. They have now been fully put on the market and purchased by local factories and remaining cocoon merchants. The Zhejiang Provincial Local Bank and the Camellia Oil and Silk Management Office have allocated 1.5 million yuan to handle spring cocoon loans. It is said that the cocoons produced in the above counties are all native varieties. As for improved varieties, they are rarely hatched. The harvest this year is better than that in western Zhejiang. The Trade Commission originally intended to control their transportation and sale, but at the request of Shanghai factories, it has agreed to allow them to be transported to Shanghai by wheel from Ningbo.</p>

<p>There are no less than 300 to 400 large and small electric weaving silk factories in this city. According to sources in the silk industry, due to the control of silk-producing areas, raw materials are scarce in Shanghai, resulting in a daily decrease in inventory and an increase in selling prices. Except for most small-scale electric factories in western Shanghai, which are limited by capital and unable to operate, and are forced to close, the prices of various silk fabrics produced by major electric weaving silk factories have increased by 10-20% due to the high cost of raw materials. As for sales to other ports, Yunnan, Guiyang, Sichuan, Kunming, and other places are the main destinations, but due to the high cost of shipping, the profits are quite low.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Concession Authorities Strictly Investigate Rice Market Manipulation, Dispatch Personnel to Stations Every Morning for Investigation, Rice Industry Still Enforces Price Limits <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since the Rice Grain Evaluation Committee, due to the difficulty of its work, resolved to dissolve itself voluntarily, yesterday morning, the rice market transactions changed from private to public prices. In addition to finding ways to dredge sources of origin, the Bean and Rice Industry Association still maintained its previous stance on the issue of price limits and strictly enforced them. The concession authorities are determined to severely crack down on hoarding households for speculation and manipulation and will punish them. Grain firms that handle entrepot grain secretly ordered foreign rice. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Private Trade Becomes Public Market Price</p>
<p>The Shanghai rice industry market has been manipulated by speculators with financial resources, resulting in a sharp rise in market prices. In addition to the 15 yuan price limit, private trading has increased by 2 to 3 yuan. Only because the buying and selling parties secretly transact, enforcement is very difficult, and the work of the evaluation committee has been severely hindered, so it was resolved to dissolve it. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the buying and selling parties were like drunkards, trading in large quantities at the original private market price, which has changed to open bidding. The highest white rice price in the first half of the market rose to 18.12 yuan, while in the second half of the market, it fell slightly, but its highest market price was still between 17.78 yuan and 18 yuan. General hoarding households, seeing the increase in sales, again stopped selling high- and medium-grade japonica rice, hoarding and raising prices.</p>
<p>Rice Price Limit Not Revoked</p>
<p>Since the Evaluation Committee resolved to dissolve itself on the 20th of this month, some simple-minded rice merchants believed that the price limit had been revoked along with it, so they acted wantonly in the market, becoming even more unrestrained and transacting on a large scale. According to investigations by the Dagang News Agency, the rice price limit was decided by the seven rice industry groups in the city at the third joint meeting. The Rice Grain Evaluation Committee was also produced by these groups. Although the Evaluation Committee has been dissolved, the case of the rice price limit still exists and has not been revoked. In terms of law, the Evaluation Committee should not have decided to dissolve itself. According to precedent, the power of dissolution must be decided by the seven groups to be legal.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Crack Down on Manipulation</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession are extremely concerned about the regulation of rice grain and the high prices in Shanghai. Detailed investigations have been made into various grains that are directly related to people's food, and it is believed that the existing stocks of rice and flour in Shanghai are sufficient to maintain supply for six months, and there is no shortage even during the lean season. The current abnormal surge in market prices in the rice market, increasing the burden on citizens and affecting public order, is extremely serious. It is evident that speculators are manipulating the market, which is abhorrent. Therefore, the two authorities have already ordered the police to dispatch detectives to the market every morning for secret investigations. Once discovered, they will be severely cracked down and severely punished as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Ways to Dredge Sources of Rice Grain</p>
<p>The registration of rice stocks by owners, which was organized by the previous Price Committee, will end in a few days. Regarding the investigation of rice stocks in the two concessions of Shanghai thereafter, it has been decided that the Bean and Rice Industry Association will be responsible for continuing to handle it. Although dredging the source of national rice is beyond the power of rice industry groups, in order to maintain the people's food in the concession, it has been decided to make every effort to ensure that the people's food is not in panic. Rice merchants have all taken maintaining the people's food and taking care of the overall situation as their purpose, and are making every effort to dredge sources, and will not take profit as the only goal. According to the current situation forecast, the rice and grain situation in Shanghai will not reach a very serious level, and the situation in the winter of 1937 will not be repeated.</p>
<p>Secretly Entrusted to Order Foreign Rice</p>
<p>According to investigations by the Dagang News Agency, recently, some rice and grain companies that specialize in entrepot trade, seeing that the price of national rice has soared and is equal to the price of foreign rice, and that it is continuing to rise, have ordered foreign rice from Saigon, Annam, and other places abroad, all entrusted to foreign firms to handle. However, the orderers are keeping it a secret, and the amount is about 10,000 to 100,000 bags. As for the foreign rice that has been imported from January to March this year, the total amount is 700,912.9 metric tons, valued at 12,232,638 yuan (national currency).</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Telephone Company's report for the year ended December 31, 1938, in terms of economic income, its profit was 948,200 yuan (Chinese currency), which was 20,205 yuan more than in 1917. Although its net income was better than in the previous year, various operating expenses have also increased compared to the previous year. At the beginning of 1938, the telephone business showed a vigorous atmosphere, and the number of people who needed telephone service was increasing day by day. Therefore, after the year-end statistics, the number of telephones exceeded the highest number before the war by 2,966. In the year 1938, the number of telephones increased by 17,860. As of December 31, 1938, the total number of telephones was 62,355.</p>
<p>In addition to the significant increase in the number of telephones, the number of uses per telephone has also increased. In 1938, the total number of calls made was 126 million, which was 24 million more than the number in 19317, which was 102 million. In order to cope with this rapid development, 7,000 additional meters were installed. Also, due to the increase in telephones in various new areas, additional trunk lines were added to meet the needs.</p>
<p>In addition, the reconstruction of the main stations that needed repair, such as Hongqiao Road and Huade Road, was also completed in 1938. In May, telephone service was restored in various areas near Shanghai. Telephone communication between Shanghai and Japan was restored in mid-October. And starting on January 1, 1939, telephone communication between Shanghai and the mainland was restored, in two locations.</p>

<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 21st that at the recent shareholders' meeting of the local French Huifeng Bank (transliteration), the board of directors presented a report praising the reliability of Chinese government bonds. It was stated that since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese government has been able to maintain the credibility of its domestic debt and is fully responsible for it. It is reported that the bank's operations last year generated a net profit of 167,790.87 yuan, which could have distributed a dividend of 7%, but the bank's authorities, for the sake of prudence, only distributed a dividend of 3.5%, totaling 70,000 yuan, and the remaining profit of 97,790.87 yuan was carried over to the next operating year.</p>

<p>Restaurants Not Allowed to Use Cold Dishes</p>
<p>Whether to Continue This Year is Still Under Study The Public Works Bureau's Health Department believes that with the arrival of summer and the increasingly hot weather, unclean cold drinks are likely to cause disease, so it is extremely concerned. Recently, it has revised Article 4 of the Other Food License Regulations as follows: "Soda water and non-carbonated water for human consumption shall be made with clean and sanitary water that has been boiled, distilled, filtered, or disinfected by other methods in a hygienic manner, and a new clause has been added:" Distilled water for human consumption shall be distilled with clean and sanitary water in a hygienic manner." Also, last summer, the Public Works Bureau's Health Department, due to the unhygienic nature of the cold dishes in restaurants, ordered the Restaurant Association not to use them, which was quite effective. This year's deadline is approaching, and the Bureau is currently studying whether to continue to implement it, and will issue a clear order.</p>

<p>Dagang News Agency reports that since the Chinese guerrilla forces controlled the outer circle of the Jiangzhe occupied area, they have given the Japanese side significant blows from time to time. Therefore, the Japanese army along the three railway lines of Jinghu, Sujiahu, and Hangzhou did not dare to lightly transfer troops. The other day, the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway tracks were destroyed by the Chinese army. According to people from Kunshan, Kunshan Station was suddenly set on fire and burned down some time ago, and the station building was almost completely destroyed. The railway material room there was also burned down, causing considerable losses. At the same time, a section of track between Kunshan and Qingyang Port was also demolished, so the Japanese army was even more frightened. Recently, in addition to dispatching pressurized cars from time to time for patrols along the lines, stone squares were also erected on both sides of the road and painted with red paint as a warning line, prohibiting people from crossing them. People in various places are also notified to report any damage to the railway tracks. Because the Japanese side has been very busy with military transportation on the lines recently, they are deeply afraid of being attacked.</p>

<p>The situation in the Fujian Sea has become tense due to harassment by Japanese aircraft and warships. Later, as the Japanese warships left one after another, the situation eased somewhat. However, according to recent reports received by the shipping industry, Japanese warships in the Fujian Sea are moving very frequently. On the morning of the 19th, Fuzhou was bombarded by Japanese warships, and Japanese aircraft also flew to Dabi for bombing. Currently, there are five Japanese warships anchored outside the port of Mawei, constantly launching speedboats for reconnaissance, indicating some intention. The situation is quite tense. The Shanghai-Fujian shipping routes originally included three major routes: Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua. Since the economic center of gravity of Fujian Province shifted to Quanzhou and other places, passenger and cargo transportation has prospered. Now, various foreign shipping companies, due to the tense situation in Fujian Province and for the sake of shipping safety, plan to temporarily suspend sailings and dock in Shanghai. Therefore, shipping from Shanghai to Fujian Province may be interrupted indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Charity Art Exhibition Closed Last Night <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Art Charity Relief Exhibition, organized by the China Industrial and Commercial Art Writers Association, has been held on the fourth floor of the Great Sun Company since its opening on the twelfth of this month. The items collected, though small, are all crystallizations of art, and have been highly valued by all sectors. Divided into categories such as arts and crafts, commercial art, paintings, Western paintings, sculptures, artistic photography, antiques, etc., there were no fewer than 5,000 pieces, which were replaced daily. In particular, Wu Guangji's jade seal boxes of various styles and the finely carved sailboat models are considered top-notch. As for the truly large goose skin produced in Longxi, meticulously crafted to be soft and smooth, with jade-like purity and a lustrous sheen, priced at 1,000 yuan, it was even more a highlight of the venue. The association, with the ten-day period expired, announced its closure at 7:00 p.m. last night. This exhibition was entirely for the purpose of charity relief. Except for the exhibitors who declared that they would take back half the price, the rest was donated to refugee relief efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e86">A Youth Model Person <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>——Mr. Yuan Ludeng——</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng is a youth model person who succeeded through hard study in his youth. In middle age, he served the society and participated in all kinds of public welfare activities. Throughout his life, he benefited from "knowing contentment and not being disgraced." His interests are quite in the style of Tao Jingjie, and even his drinking is very much in the spirit of "friends knowing he is good at drinking, they may set up wine and invite him." However, he does not necessarily aim to get drunk.</p>
<p>When the reporter went to interview him, Mr. Yuan was waving his hand and sending off the processing of his official duties at the Refugee Association. He is sixty-one years old this year, and his spirit is vigorous. A cloth gown clearly shows his simple habits. Behind his seat hangs a picture of a white-haired man entertaining his parents, commemorating his family's four generations under one roof. Grand Historian Shen Qiquan (art) and others wrote poems for him, saying, "Joyful laughter in the hall above, laughter below, indeed filial sons and virtuous grandchildren."</p>
<p>We began to talk about the future of refugee relief, and he said: There are currently more than 50,000 refugees housed in the Shanghai International Settlement. Including the refugee areas in Nanshi, there should be more than 100,000. The street refugees who have not been housed, and those who have recently come to Shanghai to take refuge, are still impossible to count. Currently, donations from all sectors can be described as enthusiastic. The association is actively working on the production and education of refugees, paying particular attention to the resettlement of refugees. Within a considerable period of time, a concrete result can be expected, giving refugees the technical skills to support themselves. Of course, this concrete result still requires the continued efforts and assistance of all sectors.</p>
<p>He began to speak freely about his personal interests and living conditions. He said that in addition to opium, he has always been fond of both smoking and drinking. However, for more than ten years, he has not bought wine or cigarettes himself, always receiving gifts from friends. He has the style of "only wine has no limit." I asked him, "How about two catties?" He said, "Three catties are also fine." He gets up at 6:30 every morning, practices martial arts, and goes to the association at 9:00 to handle official duties. He has several self-criticisms regarding his own strengths and weaknesses in life: (1) I have been trained by missionary schools since childhood and am determined to adhere to the principle of benefiting others at the expense of oneself. I have never been troubled by any hobbies in my life. (2) I came from humble beginnings as a student, and I have never forgotten the situation at the time. No matter how smooth the circumstances, I have never aspired to be pampered and comfortable. (3) I have never been annoyed by occasional setbacks. I have always held the ancient teaching of accepting adversity with equanimity. (4) I have never harbored selfish opinions in my life, whether towards society or family. I would rather suffer sacrifices than seek my own advantage. (5) Although I have often followed the customs and trends in recent years, I have never dared to cross the boundaries of morality. As for the weaknesses of self-examination, they are: (1) I am naturally straightforward. When I see someone's faults, I must advise them, or even rebuke them in person. I may not be able to be forgiven by others. Although I want to try to cultivate patience, it is already too late. (2) In my life, I place too much emphasis on sentiment. I often act rashly regardless of my abilities, such as investing in unlimited companies and serving as a director of unregistered joint-stock companies, and providing unlimited guarantees for others. I know there is a risk of bankruptcy, but I often think that people will not deceive me, and I do not know how to warn myself. (3) I am not good at managing money. As long as I have money on hand, or have a way to raise funds, I will help others in difficulty. As a result, my own burden has become heavier and heavier, and I have to rely on the help of close friends, which makes me feel ashamed. Speaking to this point, he hopes that young people in the business community can use his self-criticism as a reference.</p>
<p>Continuing in his recollection, he narrated the circumstances of his hard study in his youth, saying: "When I was ten years old, I went to school with my younger brother. Three years later, because of the poverty of the family, even the meager tuition fees were difficult to raise. I originally planned to drop out of school, but at that time I wanted to learn a trade, but I suffered from the lack of someone to support me. At that time, the British Jesus Church and the Common Society happened to set up a Kai Ming School in Yong, with an attached primary school, which did not charge tuition. So I went to school there. After two more years, it was changed to Fei Di Middle School. My younger brother and I were favored by the missionaries and admitted to the school free of charge. The following year, I took the exam and was fortunate enough to win the championship. I also received an annual scholarship of six pounds sterling from the Royal Education Road School in London. The missionary distributed half of it for tuition and half for family use." At this point, Mr. Yuan has become a good young man who dared to study in a poor family. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e87">Tragedy of Fire in Guling Road, Strict Interrogation into Cause of Fire, Cook Denies That Burned Yarn Spools Caused the Fire, Paper Shop Has Fire Insurance Worthy of Note <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In the kitchen of the Chen family at No. 70 Guling Road, a fire suddenly broke out at around 5:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month. The wind was strong, and the flames immediately shot up, burning through the mezzanine floor. Chen Zubei, a water company worker living upstairs, and his wife and children, were awakened from their dreams by the burning skin. They got up in extreme pain and immediately carried his wife, Mrs. Yu, and their seven-year-old third son, Shi Mai, jumping and escaping. Mrs. Yu suffered minor injuries. Their thirteen-year-old daughter, Jin Di, also escaped, but had been burned. The most tragic were their ten-year-old eldest son, Qingqing, and nine-year-old second son, Yu Qing, who</p>
<p>perished in the fire</p>
<p>After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, Chen Da, a detective from the New Zha Pu Fang in charge, and others arrived at the scene. They sent the injured to the hospital for treatment, examined the burnt corpses, and ordered them to be collected. It was later found that the fire was caused by the re-ignition of the ashes of burned yarn spools placed by Shi Chenglang, a Tongzhou cook hired by Qian Jichen, who was operating cotton yarn in the third room of the house. The fire spread to the paper piled nearby, causing such a tragedy. Shi was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court and prosecuted according to law. The details of the interrogation and detention have been recorded in previous reports. Now, the thirteen-year-old girl, Jin Di, who was burned, also</p>
<p>succumbed to her injuries</p>
<p>and died a few days ago. Therefore, Chen Zubei's three sons and one daughter, now only the youngest Bao Bao remains. Although Mrs. Yu's injuries have been healed, she is extremely grieved by the tragic death of her two children. On Saturday, the case was heard in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Xiao of the First Special Court. When Shi Chenglang was brought up for further interrogation, Chen Yu stood beside the case, tears streaming down her face. She also stated that the defendant usually stored the ashes from burning yarn spools in a Pu bag and had repeatedly seen him placing the Pu bag near the pile of paper. She had advised him, but the defendant never listened.</p>
<p>resulting in the tragedy</p>
<p>Chen Awu, a cooking apprentice from the second landlord Chen's family, testified that he and Shi cooked in the same stove. Shi always cooked first in the stove at five or six in the morning, while he started cooking at seven or eight. Shi always used a Pu saw to store the ashes from burning yarn spools, so that he could pick out iron pieces in his spare time and sell them. When questioned, Shi flatly denied that he had caused the fire. Then the debate began. Li Zhishan, the lawyer from the Public Security Bureau, argued that, based on the physical evidence of the burned yarn spools obtained by the Public Security Bureau and the testimony of Chen Awu, it could be proved that the defendant was responsible for the disaster and should be punished according to the law. However, Wang Xiaowen, the defendant's defense lawyer, requested the court to pay</p>
<p>close attention</p>
<p>to the fact that the second landlord of the house had set up a paper shop in the house and had fire insurance of 8,000 taels of silver. According to insurance regulations, compensation is only given if someone else's fire spreads and affects the insured. Chen Awu is an apprentice of the second landlord and cooks in the same stove as the defendant. If he is judged to be responsible for the disaster based solely on his words, it seems inappropriate. How could it be known that there were no other circumstances? Moreover, the price of yarn spools is not very cheap. Even if one wants to extract iron pieces, there is no need to use them as fuel. The judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Kidnappings Occur Frequently in Occupied Areas, One Bandit Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In the towns and villages of Xinjing, Hongqiao, Qibao, and Changqiao in northwestern Shanghai, bandits are rampant and robberies are frequent since the area was occupied. Recently, they have become even more unscrupulous, daring to kidnap people for ransom in broad daylight. The puppet police generally turn a blind eye. Shen Zhigang, who lives in Caojiazhai, east of Beixinjing Town, was suddenly kidnapped by five bandits at around 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday while Shen was in a tea house of a certain family in Beixinjing Town. Each bandit had a handgun. Shen was taken away and subjected to severe torture in the bandit's den. After half a month, his family managed to raise 800 yuan to redeem him and bring him home. Wang, the Ningbo owner of the Gong Sheng Weaving Factory in Gongjiazhai, north of Lincoln Road, was also kidnapped by bandits in broad daylight and demanded a ransom of 100,000 yuan. After several negotiations, he paid 16,000 yuan in foreign currency and was released the day before yesterday. Ding Shanming, the owner of the Yilong Rice Store in Hongqiao Town, was kidnapped in his store last month and has now been redeemed, but he still dares not return home. The old bookkeeper of the Yang Dingyuan Rice Store in Qibao Town's North Main Street was kidnapped with 7 staff members the night before last. It is heard that four of the old bookkeepers were released that night, but three staff members, including an employee Li, are still not out of danger. Shen Xiao Amei, a local who opened a cotton ginning factory in Changqiao Town on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, was kidnapped by bandits the day before yesterday. His family paid 2,600 yuan in foreign currency to redeem him. Wang, the battalion commander of the 3rd regiment of the provincial security team, learned of the matter and arrested Kang Yinquan (former town mayor of Caojiaqiao from Guangang), one of the bandits involved. After interrogation, Wang determined that the confession was true. The day before yesterday, Kang was tied up and executed by firing squad in Changqiao Town. The remaining accomplices, Cai and others, are at large and are currently being hunted down.</p>

<p>Zhang Xuecheng, a native of Huzhou (24 years old), who is an apprentice at the Zhiyuan Transportation Company at No. 11 North Suzhou Road, is still unmarried. Recently, he has been fond of prostitution. At 4:00 p.m. on the 27th of last month, Wang Enpu, the manager of the company, gave him 350 yuan in legal tender, ordering him to send it to the Xixing Silk Store on Shanxi Road. Zhang, after obtaining the money, abandoned a receipt book in a wasteland and then went to prostitute himself at No. 49 West Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession with a prostitute named Hongbao, and at No. 9 Aiduya Road with a prostitute named Suzhen. He spent all the money in two weeks and avoided going to work at the company. Manager Wang Enpu negotiated with his guarantor surnamed Chen, and as a result, he paid 200 yuan in compensation. The afternoon before yesterday, at around 8:00 p.m., apprentice Zhang suddenly went to the transportation company to make a scene with Wang Enpu, wanting to get back the money compensated by the guarantor. The Public Security Bureau sent a detective, Shen Dehui, to the scene and brought him into the Public Security Bureau. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Jiang Shuzi found him guilty and sentenced Zhang Xuecheng to eight months in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>Ji Yuanyu, a native of Suzhou, was recently instructed by Zhou Jintang, the owner of the Wansheng Silver Store on Manong Street in Suzhou, to bring ten raw silver ingots, weighing 200 taels, and 379 yuan in coins to Shanghai, intending to exchange them for legal tender at a certain money shop. At 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, while passing near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Zha Pu Road, Wang Xinhai, a native of Yong who used to be a teacher at the Huaxing Primary School at No. 72 Tangshan Road, saw him,</p>
<p>stepped forward and stopped him</p>
<p>and asked about the source of the raw silver ingots and coins. Wang immediately falsely claimed that he was an investigator from the puppet consolidated tax bureau and that such silver must be taxed, otherwise he would be taken to the bureau for punishment. He demanded a fee of 50 yuan to avoid this. Ji Yuanyu was anxious and first gave him 9 yuan and 32 cents in legal tender. While they were arguing, Wang Debiao, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Public Security Bureau, and No. 433 Indian police saw them.</p>
<p>Teacher Wang immediately ran away, but was eventually caught. He was brought to the Public Security Bureau along with Ji Yuanyu's raw silver coins, silver ingots. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The lawyer from the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case, and said that the defendant was also suspected of another theft case, and asked for a postponement. According to Ji Yuanyu's testimony of the events, Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendant and ruled that he be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Yang Fubao, a native of Hangzhou, was 37 years old this year. He was unemployed and destitute, and was staying at the home of his friend, Yuan Guisheng, at No. 5 Beifu Lane, La Ge Na Road, French Concession. Because he was addicted to gambling on lotteries, and lost every time, resulting in a mountain of debt that he could not repay, he became despondent. Yesterday morning, he hanged himself on the iron railing of the drying platform stairs at Yuan's house. When his friend, Yuan Guisheng, got up and discovered him, he was already dead and beyond help. He reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who sent the corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for autopsy. The deceased had no family in Shanghai and will be reported to the court for inspection today.</p>

<p>A gambling den was cracked down on at Longyuan Theater, Ailai Ge Road, Xinmin Lane, French Concession, where people were gambling and selling lottery tickets. The Public Security Bureau found out about it. The night before last, they dispatched more than ten Chinese and foreign detectives in two cars to the location without making a sound. Thirty gamblers who were shouting and gambling were captured on the upper floor of the theater, along with gambling tools and gambling money. They were all taken to the Public Security Bureau, questioned one by one by the head of the Public Security Bureau, and then sent to the Lujiawan General Patrol Room along with the boss to await interrogation by the court.</p>

<p>Yang Meili, a 22-year-old woman from Suzhou who used to be a dancer, living in the front building of No. 483 Fuxu Road, had a diamond ring hidden under her pillow on the bed stolen at noon on March 25th of the lunar calendar. Because Ma Zhao (47 years old), a fellow villager who lived in the back building, had come to her room to pick grass roots and was suspected, she reported it to the French Public Security Bureau. Ma Zhao was taken into custody for interrogation and detained for one night. Because there was no evidence of theft, she was released the next day. Now, Ma Zhao, whose husband is a prompter at the Great Stage, argued that she had been falsely accused of theft for no reason, which had affected her reputation, so she hired attorney Ling Xianlai to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Yang Meili of false accusation. Judge Miao Qingbang opened the court for trial the day before yesterday. The plaintiff and her lawyer appeared in court and stated the previous situation. The defendant, Yang Meili, testified that on that day, she and her sister were cooking downstairs, and there was no one in the room. The defendant came to my room to pick grass roots. When I went upstairs, the diamond ring was gone, so I reported it to the Public Security Bureau. When the detectives came to investigate, the defendant suddenly went out. After she came back, I went to the Public Security Bureau with her. My diamond ring was seen by everyone living in the same room, and everyone knew it was stolen. There was no false accusation. The court ordered the debate to end and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Buddhist Community Compiles and Prints a Grand Edition of the Avatamsaka Sutra <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Avatamsaka Sutra in Buddhism has a complete and wonderful meaning that surpasses everything. In the Tang Dynasty, the National Teacher Qingliang devoted his entire life's wisdom to writing a commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra, elaborating on the meaning of the scripture, totaling sixty or seventy volumes. Its great value has always been revered by the Buddhist community. However, from the Song and Ming Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, the transmission and engraving were corrupted, which was a major flaw. Recently, Elder Yingci and various lay Buddhists plan to recompile, collate, and reprint the book based on more than ten versions, in order to achieve the merit of receiving, upholding, lecturing, and reciting the scriptures, and to complete the incomplete classics of the past 1,300 years. A "Avatamsaka Sutra Commentary Compilation and Printing Association" was specially established at the Gongdelin Temple in this city on the 18th of this month, with the address at No. 712 Wei Hai Wei Road, specializing in this matter. The estimated printing cost is 20,000 yuan. Elder Yingci was publicly elected as the chairman, and Zhu Ziqiao, Ye Yufu, and Jiang Zhuzhuang were elected as the vice chairmen. Dharma Master Yuedong, Guan Jiongzhi, Shi Shengzhi, Fan Gunong, Li Qiqing, Li Yuanjing, Meng Wangqu, Ni Wenqing, Zhu Xiechen, Huang Youxi, and Fei Fanjiu were elected as permanent directors. Wen Lantian, Huang Hanzhi, Wu Yun, Ji Juemi, Nie Lingtai, Ding Zhonghu, Bao Cunwo, Wang Qiuhu, and Sheng Shengjiao were elected as directors, and prayed and made vows before the Buddha, resolving to complete the publication within three years. With this merit, they will dedicate it to all sentient beings in the world, eliminate karma, and bring about peace quickly. The printing fee of several thousand yuan has already been determined and deposited in the Jin Cheng Bank. In the future, payment will be made according to the book’s material costs, which is different from ordinary fundraising. The estimated price per book is 20 yuan, which will still be calculated according to the cost of the book at the time.</p>

<h3 id="e102">More Than Twenty Garbage Boats from the Two Concessions Detained in Southern Huangpu. Water Police Station Dispatches Japanese Personnel to Negotiate. Puppet "Water Police Team" Shrugs Off Responsibility <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The garbage produced daily in the two special districts, the Public Concession and the French Concession, was transported by boats from the garbage wharf before the war, concentrated and dumped at the Longhua corner of the Southern Huangpu River. The old practice was continued after the war without hindrance. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, in the waters near Bailianjing (before reaching Longhua) in the Southern Huangpu, the puppet "Police Bureau Water Police Team" arbitrarily detained more than twenty garbage boats from the two concessions. It is reported that all the detained boats were fully loaded with garbage and had not yet reached their destination for dumping. In the afternoon of the same day, the Customs Water Police Station dispatched Japanese personnel to negotiate at the puppet "team" in Dongchang Road, Pudong. The puppet "Captain" Huo Liangchen evaded the responsibility by saying that he was acting on "orders from superiors," resulting in no results. The detained garbage boats had not been released as of yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Li Genlin, a native of Taizhou, a clerk at the Youxin Shoe Store on Xinzha Road, 25 years old, married Xu Xiuying, a woman from the same hometown (21 years old). Recently, due to the high cost of living, his wife was introduced to work as a maid in a Japanese family in Hongkou. She then developed an affair with Zhang Yongnian (28 years old), a fellow townsman who worked as a clerk in a Japanese store at No. 385 Wusong Road, Hongkou. After Li discovered this, he forced Xiuying to resign and return home. Not long after, Xiuying went to work as a maid in another Japanese home and continued her relationship with Zhang. Li, lacking a pass to Hongkou, could not go to Hongkou to negotiate, though he was filled with resentment. Until the night before last, Li learned that his wife and Zhang Yongnian had gone to the Haihualou Restaurant on North Zhejiang Road to attend a birthday banquet at a certain surname's house. Li secretly hid an axe and waited near the restaurant. At about 8:00 PM, when Xiuying and Zhang were walking out arm in arm after the banquet, Li immediately used the axe to chop at them several times. They fell to the ground wounded. Police officers rushed to the scene and summoned a car to send the woman to Guangren Hospital, while Zhang was sent to Baolong Hospital. The murderer Li Genlin has been arrested by the Huishi Police Station.</p>

<p>Recently, Hu Shaochuan (37 years old, from Liyang), a former clerk of the Suzhou Wuxian Local Court, fled to Shanghai with his wife, Ms. Qian, due to the fall of Suzhou and the closure of the court. They resided in Room 219 of the Continental Apartment at No. 431 Rue Poupard (i.e. Datiebang), French Concession, paying a daily rent of one yuan. After living there for two months, they owed more than ten yuan in rent. On the night of March 14, the apartment manager, Xin Lichong from Ningbo, and the accountant, Xin Runquan, ordered a waiter to urge Hu to pay the rent. Due to a verbal conflict, Xin and others instigated Bai Yan, a clerk from the Hetaixing store in Room 103, to drag Hu out of his room and beat him violently. Hu's wife, Ms. Qian, stepped forward to dissuade them and was also beaten. The four-month-old child she was holding was also knocked to the ground, and developed a frightening sickness that led to his death. The Hu couple first filed a petition with the Special Second Court Procuratorate requesting a medical examination, and then hired lawyer Yao Yunbo to file a private prosecution for assault against Xin Lichong and Xin Runquan with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. Judge Liao Heng repeatedly opened court sessions for investigation, and summoned Le Wenchun, a resident of the Continental Apartment from Ningbo, to testify about the defendants' assault. The defendants admitted to instigating the assault and hired lawyers for their defense. The case was already concluded with the two defendants released on bail pending further review. This case has been concluded after interrogation and was adjudicated the day before yesterday. Xin Lichong was fined 400 yuan for instigating bodily harm, and Xin Runquan was fined 240 yuan for the same crime. It is reported that the defendants are dissatisfied with the verdict and are preparing to appeal to the High Third Branch Court.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Animal Protection Society reported in March and April of this year that countless people have called or come to the Society in person during these two months, requesting assistance in tracking down missing cats and dogs, entrusting the Society to find people to take in cats and dogs, or wanting to adopt cats and dogs. Although arranging for the accommodation of abandoned cats and dogs and pursuing missing cats and dogs can be regarded as a method of animal protection, most humanitarian societies do not regard it as within the scope of their activities. Therefore, there are small self-sufficient organizations specifically set up for this purpose, but no such organization exists in Shanghai. As a result, the Society's limited staff are extremely busy with this work, which takes up their time and energy to deal with more urgent matters.</p>
<p>Assistance and Protection Methods</p>
<p>Members of the public can provide great assistance to the Society in this matter by following the methods below: (1) Implement various preventive measures to avoid cats and dogs from getting lost or being stolen, such as instructing servants to close the doors of gardens and residences and pay attention to the integrity of garden fences; (2) When servants walk dogs, they must be instructed to leash the dog by the neck and take it for a walk, allowing it to walk on crowded streets; (3) The dog's license plate must always be attached to the collar, and the collar must always be worn, so that even if the dog is lost, there is a license number to check to find its owner; (4) Those who want to adopt cats and dogs can go directly to the dog houses of the French Concession or the Public Concession工部局to select them, without having to contact the Society first; (5) Join the Society as a member and pay membership fees or donate funds to expand the number of staff to cope with this matter.</p>
<p>General Abuse of Animals</p>
<p>The worst case of abuse in this period was found in the Caojiabo slaughterhouse outside the concession, where pigs, horses and cattle were inhumanely slaughtered, either chopped with axes or hoes, or allowed to bleed to death slowly. These abuse incidents have been published in newspapers and the March issue of the Blue Cross Magazine (the Society's quarterly). It is known that many horses abandoned after the races are sold and enter this slaughterhouse from the stables to suffer a terrible death. Therefore, the Society has appealed to racehorse owners to humanely destroy lame and unsuitable horses, and prevent them from participating in auctions. The Society is now taking possible steps to remedy the situation in this slaughterhouse, but due to its location outside the concession, it is difficult to take strict action. At present, the Society is working to prevent horses from being sent to this terrible slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>When the investigator last inspected the slaughterhouse, he saw a water buffalo lying on the ground, its limbs tied to wooden pillars, its head tied to an iron ring on the ground, and a two-inch diameter wound cut in its neck, allowing it to bleed to death.</p>
<p>On March 7, a member of the Society reported seeing a lame horse being dragged along Daxilu. After investigation, it was found that the horse was being taken by a groom to the above-mentioned slaughterhouse to suffer a terrible death. The Society immediately visited the horse owner and arranged for the horse to be humanely destroyed. The horse's body was then removed by strangers. On one of the hottest days in April, it was reported that two calves had collapsed on Jiangxi Road. The Society's ambulance immediately transported them to their destination. The owner was fined ten yuan by the French Concession authorities.</p>
<p>Investigators have repeatedly discovered the live plucking of pig bristles. One case was prosecuted in court, and the offender was sentenced to ten days in jail for theft.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Preparatory Meeting of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The second preparatory meeting of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory was held yesterday at Zhongxi Pharmacy on Simalu. Cai Renbao, Zhou Bangjun, Xia Xishi, and others attended. Zhou Bangjun presided over the meeting and reported on (1) Since the public offering of shares, the outside world has been very enthusiastic about subscriptions, and the paid-up capital will reach 400,000 yuan, only one-fifth short of the original amount; (2) The factory building and equipment in Xinjiagarden, Xinzha Road, have been installed separately from the original machines, and are working as usual. The latest type of pharmaceutical machine has been ordered to extract industrial chemical application raw materials and the main raw materials of medicines; (3) The expert technical discussion has been completed. Then, several points were discussed: (1) Xia Xishi proposed that the factory produces hundreds of species, and shareholders should be asked to promote and sell them. It was decided to print shareholder preferential purchase certificates and send them to shareholders when they pay for their shares. A letter was also sent to Zhongxi Pharmacy for agreement. Shareholders of this factory will be given the same special price; (2) Cai Renbao proposed that many people who have subscribed to the shares are refugees from other places and should be given work opportunities to implement labor-capital cooperation. It was decided that when the factory's business becomes more extensive, and the original staff workers' training is insufficient, shareholders will be given priority for those they recommend, but they must pass the examination and selection procedures, and be given training.</p>

<p>Ye Tiande Pharmacy New Building Opens the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Ye Tiande Pharmacy has been located at Zhonghongqiao, Hongkou for several decades, and is an old shop. Due to the Shanghai War in the previous autumn, it temporarily moved to temporary business in Aiduya Road, west of Daigouqiao. Now, because the address is insufficient for use, and in order to expand its business, the pharmacy has recently found a new building on the west end of Avenue Edward VII and Parker Road. It has been preparing for several months and is now fully completed. It will officially open on May 24. On that day, various precious tonics will be sold at low prices, so please pay attention.</p>

It can cure new coughs, children's phlegm knots, and the effect is rapid. In this time of rising prices, the owner of the shop disregards the cost and still sells it at the original price (large bottle 1.2 yuan, small bottle 6 jiao).</p>

<p>Dear Editor, according to Pan Baocheng, the owner of Santai Rice Shop, my client, the Shen Bao of the 20th of this month carries a news item about a rice shop owner being sued, which states, "Only seeking profit for oneself, disregarding the harm to others, disregarding the health of employees, abandoning them after being injured on duty without treatment, and being intentionally cruel," all of which are inconsistent with the facts. When Zhao Xuesheng, the substitute worker, was injured, I was not present. His stacking of goods was an automatic act in his job. How he stacked it, how he was injured, I do not know. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and the medical expenses were borne by this shop. Later, Xuesheng's brother, Ahe, moved Xuesheng from Guangci Hospital to Lixing Inn on Wuhu Road, and this shop continued to bear the medical expenses. Then Ahe carried Xuesheng to this shop. Xuesheng himself considered returning to the inn, but the inn refused to accept him. Then, Wang Atao, the official worker, and Zhao Ahe asked the patrolman to report the case and sent him to Renji Hospital. How the inn refused to accept him, and how the police were reported, are all unknown to me. Moreover, Jue Sunshunsheng is too young and does not participate in shop affairs. Last year, Zhao Ahe asked Qian, a lawyer, to send a letter to ask for a settlement. I knew his purpose and ignored it. This time, he has requested an additional 9,900 yuan in civil litigation, and part of the statement remains reserved for a subsequent request. It has come to the time when the dagger is revealed. This news is purely one-sided and should be corrected to show the facts. I am entrusted to come here. Please check and correct it according to the law. Sincerely, Lawyer Zhao Shaojun, May 20, To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Dear Editor, I have read the news column of your newspaper on the 20th of this month about the British Consulate investigating the International Night News, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The newspaper will be relaunched soon, and the original editorial staff has not changed. The article suddenly refers to Xu Tianfang as the editor-in-chief, which is very surprising. The editor Wang Tianhen has not resigned either. The end of the article even refers to "Wang's faction", which is even more bizarre. It is difficult to remain silent for such a deliberate destruction of the newspaper's credibility and the use of political implications to disturb social order. In addition to handling negotiations with Huguang News Agency, please correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Krampe, publisher of the British-owned International Night News, May 21, To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3 id="e111">A Message to Young Literary People with New Hobbies <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Shangqing</p>
<p>When addressing young literary people with old hobbies, my first sentence was: it is best if you do not indulge in literary hobbies. Now, when addressing young literary people with new hobbies, the first thing I want to say is still: it is best if you do not indulge in literary hobbies. The reason has been mentioned before, so I won't repeat it here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are quite a few young people who are fond of old literature, and even more young people who are fond of new literature. Therefore, as a second-best option, I can only use my sincere wishes to tell young people who are fond of new literature a few words:</p>
<p>If you are truly fond of new literature, and you want to appreciate, study, or create it, but you don't know where to start, I suggest you start with Western literature. The establishment of our new literature can be said to be entirely influenced by Western literature. Almost all famous new literary writers are proficient in Western languages and literature. They started with Western literature, so they laid the foundation for our new literature today. However, our new literature today is still far from being fully developed and capable of enlightening future generations. We still need to work hard on the same path, and the most fundamental way is still to first understand Western literature.</p>
<p>To understand Western literature, it is best to be able to understand the language of a certain Western country so that you can read directly. Otherwise, reading many translated works is also a good way. Translated works with good writing and content are of course the most suitable for us. Even if the writing is not very good, as long as the content is not bad, we can still extract its essence and focus on the spirit rather than the form.</p>
<p>After you have read a lot of Western literature, know what the spirit of new literature is, what the differences between new literature and old literature are, and you have thoroughly understood the general technical points, then you will naturally want to start writing. Perhaps at this time you will have another question: what kind of writing should I use to write well? Or, to what extent should I write to be considered good?</p>
<p>There is a lot of room for flexibility in the level of "good," so I cannot set a standard or define what constitutes "good." However, I can say what the minimum level of "good" should be, and that is: it must be coherent. Sentences should not have grammatical errors; paragraphs should not have ambiguous flaws; the structure should not be too rigid or too chaotic; the intention should not be profound but not easily understood.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone wants to be coherent; but how can one achieve coherence? Perhaps this is the question that will ultimately arise.</p>
<p>To solve this problem: first, you still need to study Western literature; second, you need to study high-quality new literary works. Western literature is generally coherent, but since the writing is different, it cannot directly help our writing, so we still have to study our existing high-quality literary works. By "high-quality," I don't mean to point them out one by one. Generally speaking, new literary books published by the Commercial Press, the Chung Hwa Book Company, the World Book Company, and the Kaiming Bookstore can all be considered high-quality. Of course, there may also be high-quality new literary books published by other bookstores, but there are also some inferior ones, so you need to be selective.</p>
<p>I strongly disapprove of the idea that in order to create new literature, one must study old literature, as if reviewing the old can really lead to new understanding. I would rather see Europeanized sentences with awkward usage of "na ne ma" than see fluent classical Chinese clichés using "zhi hu zhe ye," because the former is easy to improve, while the latter is a deeply ingrained habit that is almost incurable. Of course, today's new literary writers did not succeed simply by studying Western literature and completely abandoning old literature. Old literature can indeed contribute to new literature. However, I believe that studying old literature always has more disadvantages than advantages. To avoid confusing people, it is best not to consult old literature.</p>
<p>I dare not say that the current literary supplements in newspapers and various magazines have reached a good level in terms of writing, so we don't need to emulate them. However, incoherent literature does appear in supplements or magazines, which is a fact. Because supplements and magazines have time constraints, they inevitably have oversights, unlike single-volume books, which can be carefully polished and strive for perfection. Therefore, I hope that those who want to study new literature from supplements or magazines to improve their own new literary writing should be very careful. As for some deliberately superficial writing with ulterior motives, I think you shouldn't learn it at all.</p>
<p>When you have a complete grasp of the content and form of new literature, you can naturally start writing freely. But when you create, I still want to tell you two things:</p>
<p>Do not use your talent to engage in destructive work. Sarcasm and ridicule are sometimes necessary, but you shouldn't think that it is the only skill a writer should have. The garden of literature is vast, and the flowers and fruits in it are definitely not just cursing or ridiculing people. As for cursing wrongly or unreasonably, that is of course not allowed. Why have writers been looked down upon throughout history and called "frivolous"? This tradition of excluding dissenters is also a major reason! Similarly, self-promotion, mutual flattery, and self-congratulation are also undesirable, as their only effect is to destroy literature and misuse your talent. I hope you can also avoid these.</p>
<p>Do not write articles solely for yourself, especially not in the current era. "Art for art's sake" may be acceptable in prosperous times, but now, if you have the talent for writing, you should only dedicate it to the country and the nation. At the very least, even if you want to sigh and complain, you should look at those who are more unfortunate than you and sigh and complain on their behalf, because you have a pen and don't have to worry about opportunities, while they have nothing. If you don't help them, no one will. Therefore, I hope you use fewer trivial matters around you as material. The above are my words to young literary people with new hobbies. Of course, this is just my personal limited view, and there are many places that need to be supplemented or discussed further. Due to space limitations, I can only leave it at that for now.</p>
<h3 id="e112">General Lu <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Shengdan</p>
<p>— War Zone Notes</p>
<p>After Lao Tai went to Ruichang with the army, Jianxiong had to leave for Xianning soon because his vacation was over, and I, having arrived in Hankou from Lu'an, had to return to the Dabie Mountains to continue the work I was supposed to do. At this time, the battle around Wu'ao had entered a critical stage, but because I had arranged to meet General Lu Han, I had to delay my departure to see the demeanor of the famous Yunnan army general. Moreover, he had made special contributions in the Battle of Taierzhuang, and I felt it was necessary to meet him in order to collect some valuable historical materials. So, although I was ready to leave, I did not immediately say goodbye to Wuhan. At the same time, the defense area he was in charge of this time happened to be at the end of the Yuehan Railway in Hunan Province. If the Three Towns were to be swallowed up, then he would bear a great responsibility in the western Hubei area. Therefore, my departure date for returning to the Dabie Mountains was extended by two weeks.</p>
<p>I remember it was a day of very heavy air raids. Several more deep pools were added to the Hanyang Airport. Fortunately, the soil was unlucky and flew around for no reason. They always use the things they get from "taxing the people to the fullest" to fight with the soil, which really feels like a waste. Therefore, friends who came back from the war zone all showed an indifferent attitude towards bombings. After the air raid alarm was lifted, the phone rang: "General Lu is waiting for you at Dingyuli in Hunan Street. Please come immediately. He is going to cross the river this afternoon!" It was Director Peng of the Political Training Department speaking, with a heavy Yunnan accent.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Dingyuli, the first people I saw were several young girls from the Yunnan Women's War Zone Work Team. During my previous visit, I had become quite familiar with them. But what gift did I have? None at all; all I had was a respectful greeting.</p>
<p>When I met General Lu, his "gentle and refined" demeanor made me wonder if he was a scholar, or perhaps a university professor? His orderly conversation was like that of a "eloquent" diplomat. He talked about their breakout from Xuzhou and the long journey of over seven hundred li on foot, without any fatigue, just like the female students from Anhui University's War Zone Work Team that I saw in Huayang, full of energy. "Santa Claus is here, you must have brought some gifts!" The girls really knew how to joke. My conversation with them lasted for two hours before it finally stopped. The topic, of course, was the past Battle of Taierzhuang. Finally, he said, "When we triumph in the future, let's meet at the Yellow Crane Tower!"</p>
<p>With a sincere smile, I shook hands with General Lu and said goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Light is Already in Sight <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zenghui</p>
<h3 id="e114">Plea <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>It is not a low groan, nor is it a wind-like wail, but the tears of our millions of people, flowing into a sea, and from this sea comes a sound like a giant wave. These millions of suffering hearts of ours—perhaps the most unfortunate. Those whose fates are governed by different fortunes never think of these hearts that have only suffered. Who knows the deep pain sometimes inflicted upon our hearts, making us forget that our bodies are also wandering helplessly? Who gives us the friendship of love? That is a dream! They ultimately have their own fortunes, sometimes casting a glance of sincere sympathy upon us for a moment, but after turning their heads, they love their own fortunes even more deeply. To whom can we turn to plead? Truth has hidden itself in the deep valleys, having long forgotten this group of us!</p>
<p>We are forced to act out tragedies. Will truth give us a bit of light? There must be a ray of light in the darkness. As long as it can give us a bit of hope, we can go and seek it.</p>
<p>Why have our homes become piles of rubble? We did not excessively enjoy ourselves in them. Why has shapeless flesh and blood stained our rice fields? Why has our beloved child been taken away, he will no longer cry for milk when he is hungry, no longer intimately snuggle in my arms and shout "fear?" Why must tears drip onto my own severed arm that I am tightly holding?</p>
<p>Truth, please illuminate this world again, do not lightly abandon this group of countless suffering people. Give us a ray of hope!</p>
<p>Wandering aimlessly, without a home, a wandering that seems to have no seasons, when the fierce summer sun mercilessly shines down, sweat soaking through our ragged clothes that never dry. There are also big houses there, but we dare not set foot inside, because they do not need truth. The days slip away like this forever, the seasons are not kind to us. The biting cold wind wraps around our bodies in the harsh winter, and we still wear the same torn clothes we wore in the summer. Although our bodies are frozen, there is still a conscious heart that has not frozen to death, and this heart is forever marked with a question—'Is this the verdict of truth?'</p>
<p>Heaven! This is not a curse, because perhaps this is fate. Looking at that bright and warm place, but we do not have the courage to knock on the door. Who would bother to listen to our lament? Which door would accommodate us, these homeless wanderers? Even if the wind blows down this body that cannot withstand hunger and cold, in the eyes of others, it may be no more than a dog that has frozen to death!</p>
<p>Who has ever witnessed the blood of their own aged parents staining a sharp blade? Lying in the rubble, groaning in pain? Their hearts were just as loving towards their children as other people's parents, but they encountered a situation contrary to reason and compassion. They never complained that their children were not as good as others, but in their hearts at the moment of eternal farewell, they still held a thought, deeply fearing that their children suffering on this bloody ground would encounter even more cruel devastation!</p>
<p>Whenever we pray for the coming of truth, we feel something stuck in our throats, as if the blood in our hearts is dripping down. Our deep voices turn into trembling sobs. What more suffering awaits us? Yet we do not expect to die. Perhaps when we reach the end of suffering, we will finally be saved. Enduring the pain, harboring this hope: behind the layers of dark clouds hides the sun, and darkness will eventually be driven out of the world!</p>
<h3 id="e115">Learning to Cry <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Chu</p>
<p>It seems someone once said, "Crying is a sign of weakness." Yes, when two children fight, the weaker one will inevitably lose, and when they lose, they will inevitably cry. From this, we can also prove that "crying is a sign of weakness" is correct, so why should we "learn" it?</p>
<p>However, clever people say: crying is a method of being human, a secret to success. Their reasoning is that "everyone has a heart of compassion," and the way to touch other people's compassion is to "cry." They also cite a large number of successful people, like Liu Xuande, like Shen Baoxu, like...etc., to prove that "crying" is the secret to success. Since "crying" is the secret to success, its importance is obvious, and how can one not "learn" it? But how to learn? And how to "put it to use" after learning? Let's give some examples to clarify:</p>
<p>For example: You see that the hearts of people in society are not as they used to be, and the social atmosphere is deteriorating. So you give a speech in public on the methods to remedy this, but you must shed a few tears; or publish an article, but in the article, you must not omit the words "alas"—or, to be more Westernized, use "oh"—then people will be moved and give you the title of "moralist." When you encounter refugees on the street asking you for money, you can turn your head and walk away—the faster you walk, the better; but when you return to your mansion, you must "ping ping ze ze" write a few ancient or modern poems of "mourning the refugees" or "crying for fellow compatriots," and use a classic quote such as "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have starved to death," and publish it in a newspaper or magazine. Then people will call you a "poet elder" and give you the title of "philanthropist." If your parents or other elders in your family die, you can watch movies or hold dancing girls, but the most important thing is that in the "obituary" or "announcement of mourning," you must not omit the words "weeping blood" or "shedding tears," even if you feel no pain in your heart. But when you meet friends, your eyes must be as red as blood, and when you speak, your voice must be slightly trembling. Then people will still say that you are able to "grieve to the point of emaciation" and crown you with the title of "filial son." Similarly, when talking about national affairs, you must cry bitterly, or sob uncontrollably, to show that your "love for the country does not lag behind others." Therefore, people will still crown you with the title of "patriot"...</p>
<p>If you don't want titles, then is there no place to use crying? Well, there are other uses.</p>
<p>For example: If you want to borrow money from someone, you must wear a mournful face (if you can really cry, that's even better, but if you can't, at least show some crying expression), then people will believe that you really have no money and are truly poor. Otherwise, you will definitely be turned away and hit a wall. If you fail a class in school, you just need to go to the teacher and wail loudly, preferably with tears streaming down your face, explaining the reasons why you failed. Then you can pass and be promoted. If you quarrel with your husband, or fight and suffer losses, then you just need to "cry," "cry" at the ancestral altar, for an hour, two hours, a day, two days...then your husband will definitely be impressed and fall at your feet under your short cheongsam, obeying your every command.</p>
<p>Since the way of crying came into being, it has spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and everyone is vying to emulate it, each using their ingenuity, creating a chilling and ghostly atmosphere. Therefore, I picked up my pen and judged:</p>
<p>"The way of being a human lies in deception, the way of deception lies in crying. The clever people do not die, and the chaos does not stop!"</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e116">Outdoor Summer Concerts Organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Band <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Starting June 1st and Ending August 31st, Stages and Seats are Being Actively Arranged in Various Parks</p>
<p>The early summer monsoon brings information about the summer heat, covering the city with a summer coat, making all life's movements flow into the summer rapids. Cold drinks and swimming pools have begun to become active; all moving and still things are changing regularly with the shift of seasons.</p>
<p>The outdoor summer concerts organized annually by the Shanghai Municipal Council Music Band are now ready and will begin playing on June 1st ahead of schedule. Originally, it was customary to start on July 1st and end at the end of September. Starting a month earlier this year, this correction of the time arrangement is indeed very appropriate, because the number of visitors to the park in June is gradually increasing, while the number of park visitors in September is decreasing.</p>
<p>It is not yet the hottest day, and the parks in France, Béthune Park, Zhao Feng Park, the Bund Park, and Jiaozhou Park are already extremely crowded, especially the crowds wandering around in the afternoon. If we calculate the ratio of the five million citizens to the area of these few parks, it is indeed not enough. Therefore, in the "isolated island," in the season when people need to let out some heat, as long as there is some artificially decorated greenery, there will inevitably be a phenomenon of being full to the brim. It seems that open-air concerts can be held in any park this summer, but because of the equipment and location, there are only four locations where they can be played: Zhao Feng Park, the Bund Park, France Park, and the French Association. But France Park and the French Association are only separated by a low wall, so in fact, there are only three locations. Now it is stipulated that from June 1, brass music will be played every Wednesday and Thursday in France Park; every Friday in the Bund Park; and every Tuesday and Saturday in Zhao Feng Park.</p>
<p>Starting June 14, in addition to the above brass concerts as usual, orchestral music will also be played from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM at the following two locations:—every Thursday at the French Association; every Monday and Saturday at Zhao Feng Park.</p>
<p>The park bureaus are now actively arranging and scrubbing the performance stage and seats. Except that Zhao Feng Park has a ready-made semi-circular bandstand, and the Bund Park also has a ready-made hexagonal pavilion, the performance stage in France Park is temporarily built with foreign pine wood planks under the large trees in the middle of the park; the performance stage of the French Association is to use the original terrace in front of the building, covered with blue cloth.</p>
<p>When the open-air concerts are played, in addition to the park tickets, you also need to buy additional tickets. Tickets for orchestral concerts are divided into two types: one yuan and fifty cents; brass concerts do not sell tickets, but rent for canvas lounge chairs, charging twenty cents per person.</p>
<p>Based on past situations and experience, because most of the music played is famous songs from European and Western countries, most Chinese people, except for a small number who have researched music art, do not understand the kind of rhythm, music theory, nature, origin of the music, literary value, and the technology of its performance. They only use its sound to regulate the monotony and loneliness of their hearing. The so-called artistic and poetic appreciation has not yet become universal and popular, so the audience is not as crowded as for low-level song and dance, and even rows of lounge chairs are empty, which is equivalent to being set up in vain. From this, we can see the general public's degree of appreciation for musical art.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, in terms of the principle of saving consumption, it is advisable to listen while sitting on the grass without spending money, because the sound is no different from listening while lying on a chair, and you do not have to be restricted by your position, you can move freely. Moreover, it is not necessary to spend money to be considered to understand musical art! As long as you have free time, you can listen to your heart's content every afternoon or evening within two months without spending any money!</p>

<p>With Various Insect Hatching Processes and Specimens of Colorful Butterflies, it is the Crystallization of French Priests' Efforts</p>
<p>The intellectual classes, who are buried in a world of eroticism, rarely visit museums or other places for academic research. To put it bluntly, how many people can often go to the library to smell the scent of books?</p>
<p>Someone said that Chinese science is not progressing. I say that at the very least, we must change the living environment of Shanghai people.</p>
<p>Regarding museums, I know that there are two in total in the Shanghai concessions, one is the museum on Museum Road, and the other is the museum attached to Aurora University.</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Municipal Government spent a lot of money to build a museum, and held an exhibition of architectural styles of past dynasties, with detailed explanations and introductions to the greatness of ancient buildings.</p>
<p>Now, this museum is buried in smoke and rubble, which is indeed a source of endless vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Regarding the Aurora Museum, I had broken the rules and visited it once before it was open. The day before yesterday, they held their 70th anniversary ceremony, and the various specimens collected were particularly rich.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down a little bit of material that has not been recorded in the various newspapers:</p>
<p>From this 70-year-old Aurora Museum, we can also see that the energy that religious scholars have put into China is indeed amazing. Starting with the founder, Father Heude, and continuing through Fathers Le Doré, Père Heude, Père Blanc, Père Sicard, to the current person in charge, Father Zheng, they have worked tirelessly and continuously, overcoming many hardships and struggles, to collect so many valuable specimens.</p>
<p>These many priests specialize in collecting one or two types of specimens. For example, Father Le Doré's collection of deer specimens is the richest in the Far East (now there are a total of 3,675 types); the founder, Father Heude, traveled around the earth almost seven times in order to collect various specimens; and now, he has left China with many precious "Chinese Natural History" works. These works have made great contributions to those who study natural science in China. There is also Father Blanc, who specializes in the study of plants, and Father Sicard, who specializes in collecting insects.</p>
<p>The entire museum has three floors. The bottom floor is for antiques and bronzes, which I visited before; the second floor is for plant specimens and animal specimens; and the third floor is for insect, shell, and bird specimens.</p>
<p>Among the insect specimens, there are many various kinds of insects and ants that you have never seen before, and the processes of how they live and hatch. For example, a small bamboo tube is the perfect place for a small insect to hatch; a piece of soil is the perfect home for another type of insect. These specimens are all living, step by step showing their nests and changes.</p>
<p>In particular, many colorful butterfly specimens are really extremely beautiful. These insects, which represent the colors of nature, are worth lingering over.</p>
<p>Among the birds, there are even more exquisite specimens, such as a tiny bird, how it arranges its nest in a branch and a bamboo tube, and how it hatches its eggs.</p>
<p>After visiting this Aurora Museum, which includes hundreds of thousands of specimens of animals, plants, and insects, people feel the greatness and beauty of nature even more.</p>
<p>This museum is open to the public for two weeks starting yesterday. After two weeks, there may be a small fee to enter.</p>

<p>— Respectfully Submitted by Xu Jie</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am an apprentice in a shop and also a reader of your esteemed newspaper. A few days ago, I saw a news item in your paper about the apprentice night school being opened at the Shanghai Eastside Community Center. Now I have a small request and dare to borrow a corner of your publication to ask the gentlemen who founded the school to kindly consider adopting it.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Gentlemen of the Shanghai Eastside Community Center: Greetings. Due to my family's financial constraints, I became an apprentice at a shop in this port at the age of fourteen through a friend's introduction. Time flies, and it has been over two years already. In the past, I very much wanted to find an opportunity to improve my knowledge, but due to various reasons, I have never been able to fulfill this wish. Now that such an opportunity exists, of course, I cannot let it pass lightly. I am very gratified, thinking that my long-cherished wish of several years can be fulfilled. However, the early hour gives me pause. Shops in Shanghai generally open around 7:00 AM and close at 9:00 PM. If I were to ask the shop owner for leave to attend school every day before 9:00 PM, it would be quite impossible. But to miss such a good opportunity is unbearable, so I dare to venture to state my case and earnestly request that the class time be changed to 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM every night. If you would be so kind as to grant my request, I would be grateful beyond words. I eagerly await your reply in the newspaper as to whether or not you will grant it. With best wishes for your well-being.</p>

<p>Assuming any one of England, France, or the Soviet Union engages in war with the German-Italian Axis, the other two are highly likely to be drawn into the vortex.</p>
<p>However, it is also a natural course of events that any one of England, France, or the Soviet Union is unwilling to be the first to clash with Germany and Italy, so as to avoid significant sacrifices.</p>
<p>The fact that the anti-aggression front between England and the Soviet Union cannot be resolved smoothly at the moment reflects this mentality. However, the end result, compelled by the environment, is that there is no alternative but to follow this path of peaceful co-existence.</p>

<p>He Liyu asked, "Is that Mrs. Xu, the village chief, right now?" Village Chief Zhu said, "Isn't it? Later on, this old man and young woman actually formed this couple. So, before Old Man Xu's family property was completely dissipated, people thought that Xie Ayu's marriage to him was to covet his property. After the old man died, she could sweep away everything and leave. Even if Xie Ayu didn't have this intention, people would often suspect her. Now that Old Man Xu's family property has been donated entirely, people have nothing to say. Old Man Xu also feels that Xie Ayu's marriage to him came from genuine affection. Just imagine, an old man in his seventies, without anyone to support him, it's very inconvenient, right? Who knew that after they got married, in less than three years, they had a fair, chubby child, which was really unexpected beyond expectations. Not only did others find it unexpected, but the old man and young wife themselves also found it unexpected! In the past, Chinese wealthy people often had money but no sons. A group of poor people, however, had sons. These are two old sayings. Who knew that this Old Man Xu, initially had money but no sons. But later, when he had no money, he suddenly had a son. Therefore, some people even said that it was destined by fate. Now this child is already six years old. Old Man Xu was seventy-seven years old when he had him, which can be considered having a son in old age. Old Man Xu gave him a name, a single character 'Chi' (遲, late), meaning that he came too late. But after all, he is still his son, what does it matter? Children nowadays are more fortunate the later they are born." He Liyu said, "Having a child at seventy-seven years old is indeed rare, and moreover, they never had children before, so they must be overjoyed." Zhu Airen said, "Men are different from women. Women after their reproductive years cannot do anything. Men don't care, as long as their partner can still bear children. I heard from our old Doctor Zhang that we used to have a Mr. Feng Menghua who had a son at eighty-two years old. Because China has always had a system of concubines, old men take young concubines. As long as their energy hasn't waned and they meet the conditions for reproduction, of course, they can have children. I've seen Village Chief Xu a few times. Although he's over eighty years old, his body is still strong and healthy, clearly a long-lived man!" Zhu Aiqun said, "I know Village Chief Xu's family matters very well. Because his wife was delivered by me. People say: old people often return to their childhood, and Village Chief Xu is really like a child, completely listening to his wife's instructions." (116)</p>
<h3 id="e121">Reflections on "In the Dead of Winter" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“Let Us Live”</p>
<p>Produced by Columbia Pictures, Shown in Nanjing</p>
<p>After watching "In the Dead of Winter," I couldn't help but think of Paul Muni's "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," and I also remembered an article published in a certain newspaper at the time of the film's release, "Law is Nothing More Than Human Sentiment." Yes, a person who has established many businesses for society and has a considerable position in society, who was a fugitive in the past, the law that protects human rights still impartially deprives him of his freedom. So "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" is not so much an exposé of the darkness of the penitentiary, but rather the playwright's skepticism towards the law.</p>
<p>In "In the Dead of Winter," the taxi driver Brick is mistaken for a robber by the original owner, and because his lover Mary cannot provide evidence that he was indeed standing outside the church at the time of the robbery, he is sentenced to death under the "unanimous condemnation, no room for defense" law. The reason why the playwright created such a story is not like other films about wrongful convictions, with tortuous and bizarre plots, and finally discovering the real culprit at the last moment, to stimulate the audience; here, he also, like "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," holds a skeptical attitude towards the law and some satire towards the disregard for human life by law enforcers. For example, after Detective Ewart discovered the bullet, he was convinced that Brick was wrongly accused and earnestly asked the prosecutor to postpone the execution, but the prosecutor's reply was "This is not my job." Also, when the detective and Mary went to New York to find out the real culprit and asked the police station for assistance, they were refused because the procedures were not met. Finally, Brick "gets his name cleared on a snowy night," and when the prosecutor declares to him upon his release, "This is my duty," Brick refuses his request to shake hands and thanks the detective instead, walking out proudly. These all clearly show the playwright's intent. Therefore, Let Us Live cannot be solved merely by a child (who discovered the robber's car) and the detective's efforts. Here, law enforcers should do their best to carefully examine the case, collect evidence, and give the defendant ample time to present counter-evidence, so as to reduce the occurrence of wrongful convictions (of course, it would be better if there were absolutely none); at the same time, the law is a dead thing, and how to weigh the pros and cons and incorporate "human sentiment" in special circumstances is something that legal scholars need to study.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this film is also quite lovely. He makes the emotions of each scene fully develop, and the editing is tight, and the photographer also contributes a lot. For example, in the two robberies, the photographer used strong and weak light to help create a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>As for Henry Fonda, I agree with Mr. Li Zhihua's opinion that his portrayal of the taxi driver is very calm and powerful, and his passionate scenes with Maureen O'Sullivan are reminiscent of Charles Farrell in "Seventh Heaven." The performances of Maureen O'Sullivan (Mary) and Ralph Bellamy (Detective) are also not weak.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Analysis of the Recent Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yiwen</p>
<p>Since the "Huaxing Bank" opened on the 16th of this month, those who are unaware of the inside story have been uneasy, thinking that the value of the legal tender will suffer a major pressure, and the financial market in Shanghai will inevitably be affected. However, up to now, the facts have shown us that the value of the legal tender has not changed in the slightest, and the financial market in Shanghai has not shown any unstable phenomena, proving that the worries caused by the establishment of the "Huaxing Bank" are just the worries of ordinary people.</p>
<p>In fact, looking at the actual situation of the Shanghai financial market at present, it is not China's legal tender that is affected by the establishment of the "Huaxing Bank," but the Japanese yen itself. A few days before the opening of the "Huaxing Bank" (May 13), the black market exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the legal tender was 100 yen to 102 yuan of legal tender; but since the 16th (the opening day of the Huaxing Bank), the Japanese yen has fallen to the same price as the legal tender, and today (May 20), it has fallen to only 95 yuan of legal tender. (See today's newspaper) In this week, the Japanese yen has depreciated by more than eight yuan against the legal tender, and this downward trend may continue to develop in the future.</p>
<p>The depreciation of the Japanese yen did not start today. I remember that in June and July of last year, the market price of the Japanese yen in the open market was about 30% higher than that of the legal tender (i.e., 100 yen could be exchanged for about 130 yuan of legal tender). By September, it had dropped to 20% (i.e., 100 yen could be exchanged for 120 yuan of legal tender), and by January and February of this year, it had dropped to 10% (i.e., 100 yen could be exchanged for 110 yuan of legal tender). Recently, it has fallen below the parity with the legal tender. If converted using British exchange, in September of last year, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen had fallen from its benchmark exchange rate (one shilling and two pence) to ten pence, by January and February of this year, it had fallen to nine pence, and recently it has fallen to about seven pence. This continuous downward trend of the Japanese yen is certainly not an accidental phenomenon, but has its objective reasons. It is worthy of our research.</p>
<p>In September of last year, when the depreciation of the Japanese yen was at its most severe, I wrote an article for Wenhui Bao (see the economic special issue of the newspaper on September 20), pointing out the reasons for its depreciation. I am excerpting a section of it for reference:</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the war in 1937, no less than 200 million yen of Japanese banknotes have flowed into China. Among them, 150 million yen flowed into North China (mostly banknotes of the Bank of Korea), and 50 million yen flowed into the Jiangnan war zone (mostly banknotes of the Bank of Japan). The source of these banknotes is partly the funds used by the Japanese army to procure military supplies in the war zone, and mostly the salaries of Japanese soldiers fighting in China. In February and March (last year), as much as 50 million yen had flowed into Shanghai. By May and June, some speculators used legal tender in Shanghai to buy Japanese yen in North China, so Japanese yen from North China poured southwards, and Shanghai became a place where Japanese yen was rampant. The number of Japanese yen in Shanghai has increased. If it were possible to freely purchase foreign exchange, then its value would naturally not be a problem. However, under the strict management of the Japanese government, if one wants to purchase more than 100 yen of foreign exchange, one must apply for approval, and the conditions are very harsh. Not only that, but Japanese banks in Shanghai also refuse to accept transactions (such as documentary bills) that use Japanese yen to pay for the price of goods exported from Japan. (The purpose is to restrict the export of goods without foreign exchange) The environment in which the Japanese yen in Shanghai is located is like this, and the actual need for it in the Shanghai market is not great, so it has become a paralyzed currency, and its value is naturally unavoidable."</p>
<p>The above is the general reason for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in September of last year, but what is the situation of the current depreciation of the Japanese yen? First, let me introduce the Japanese side's own explanation.</p>
<p>The Japanese believe that the biggest reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai are the following three points: First, it is the result of restrictions on the import of soybeans and soybean oil from Northeast and North China into Central China. In the past, the value of soybeans and soybean oil imported from Northeast and North China to Shanghai was about 2 to 3 million yuan per month. Currently, since Shanghai no longer imports such goods, Shanghai will have an excess of 2 to 3 million yen per month; the excess of yen funds in Shanghai will naturally cause the value of the Japanese yen to fall.</p>
<p>Second, the number of Japanese people coming to China has increased sharply, and Japanese yen has also been brought in large quantities. According to statistics for April, a total of 8,350 Japanese people came to Shanghai. If each person brings an average of 500 Japanese yen, then 4 million Japanese yen will flow into Shanghai in one month, and 50 million yen in one year. In the Shanghai financial market, which has no Japanese yen status, it is naturally very difficult to accommodate such a huge amount of funds. This will inevitably affect the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Third, Japan has restricted the export of goods to Central China, reducing the need for Japanese yen. Due to the reduction in the supply of Japanese goods in the occupied areas, the people in the occupied areas will naturally use the military tickets issued by Japan to transport them to Shanghai, exchange them for Japanese yen, and then exchange the Japanese yen for legal tender, so as to purchase the necessary materials from foreign or Chinese merchants with legal tender. Therefore, the result of the large demand for legal tender by the people in the occupied areas will naturally put pressure on the Japanese yen and cause it to depreciate. (See the Shanghai Daily News on May 19)</p>
<p>We also acknowledge that the above three situations are indeed the reasons for the current depreciation of the Japanese yen, but they are only superficial reasons, derived reasons. Fundamentally, it is the issue of Japan's national strength. In other words, it is the issue of the purchasing power of the Japanese yen. We know that since Japan launched the war against China, its military expenditures have reached as much as 10 billion yen. The consumption of military expenses is actually the consumption of material resources, which is also the consumption of national strength. If Japan's productivity is sufficient to adapt to the huge military consumption, then it would not be a problem for the Japanese government to mobilize the materials needed for the war through financial institutions. However, everyone knows that Japan's productivity is very fragile. Not only has it failed to supplement the materials needed for the war due to the massive consumption of the war, but also due to the massive consumption of material resources and manpower in the war, it has become increasingly unable to make ends meet in its productivity, and has entered a state of exhaustion. Now the Japanese government is only relying on the method of draining the pond to catch all the fish, issuing more banknotes and creating new purchasing power to requisition the savings of the people and maintain its external war. Looking at the amount of Japanese yen banknotes issued, it has increased from 15 billion yen in June 1937 to about 25 billion yen at present. (It once increased to 29 billion yen at the end of last year) In the twenty months after the war, the amount of new purchasing power (banknotes) has increased by almost one time compared with before the war, while its domestic materials (including savings and productivity) have not increased with the quantity of the forged purchasing power (in fact, it is decreasing). Therefore, the relative balance between purchasing power and materials has been lost. What is expressed domestically is the soaring of prices, and what is expressed abroad is the depreciation of the Japanese yen exchange rate.</p>
<p>The current depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is also evidence of the reduction in its purchasing power. However, the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is not only against the legal tender (because the value of the legal tender has not changed), but also against all foreign currencies. However, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons for the reduction in purchasing power, there are two other reasons for the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai that cannot be ignored:</p>
<p>First: The recent depreciation of the puppet United Reserve Bank of North China has caused the Japanese yen to depreciate as well. The depreciation of the puppet United Reserve Bank is due to the fact that the puppet government of North China and the Japanese army need it in finance, so they issue it indiscriminately. Also, half of it is due to the people's fear of the value of the puppet United Reserve Bank, so they exchange it for goods (or legal tender). Because of the parity relationship between the puppet United Reserve Bank and the Japanese yen, the value of the Japanese yen is also lowered. Therefore, some speculators (including Japanese) use legal tender to buy Japanese yen in North China, and then transport the Japanese yen to Shanghai to buy legal tender, which makes the Japanese yen in Shanghai even more needed for the legal tender, and pressures its value to fall.</p>
<p>Second: The plan to issue banknotes by the "Huaxing Bank" will inevitably reduce the actual need for Japanese yen; at the same time, because the banknotes of the "Huaxing Bank" have no real reserves, they will inevitably depreciate due to indiscriminate issuance in the future (just like the situation of the puppet United Reserve Bank of North China). Japan knew this consequence early on, so it declared that the "Huaxing Bank notes" would not be linked to the Japanese yen, which is tantamount to reflecting the emptiness of the Japanese yen's foundation. Therefore, most people (including Japanese) dare not collect Japanese yen, but would rather exchange it for legal tender with a stable value (or buy goods), which makes the value of the legal tender relatively higher, and makes the value of the Japanese yen fall step by step.</p>
<p>The above two reasons are so powerful in promoting the depreciation of the Japanese yen in Shanghai precisely because the purchasing power of the Japanese yen has been fundamentally reduced. It can also be said to be the result of inflation. Therefore, what is expressed by this is not only the shaking of the external credit of the Japanese yen, but also the significant losses suffered by Japan in the war against China. If the war against China cannot be ended, then the consumption of Japan's national strength will definitely increase day by day, and the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will also deteriorate day by day. The result of the deterioration of the purchasing power of the Japanese yen will not only make it difficult to maintain the war, but also promote the total collapse of its entire national economy. The current continuous depreciation of the Japanese yen shows that Japan is already on the road to total collapse. On the contrary: the current stability of the value of the legal tender and the relative increase in value against the Japanese yen are proof of the correctness of China's strategy of protracted attrition warfare, indicating that China has already moved towards a dominant position in the military, and the final victory is not a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e123">"Huaxing Bank" and the Shanghai Market <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xinhai</p>
<p>The so-called "Huaxing Commercial Bank" has a negligible impact on the Shanghai market; although there are rumors in the market, as long as ordinary people do not disturb themselves, "Huaxing" cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>However, when the news of the establishment of "Huaxing" came out, the forward exchange rate of the legal tender once tightened, which was probably due to the fact that the market was not calm at first and did not fully understand it; and when it recognized its nature and tricks, it immediately stabilized as usual. However, on the day of its opening on the 16th, various unfounded rumors were spread again from nowhere, causing the sensitive market to be foolishly manipulated once again; the black market price of public bonds suddenly dropped as a result. The rumors I heard are roughly in four categories:</p>
<p>1. It is said that in order to resist "Huaxing's" attempt to seize legal tender, the National Government plans to replace the legal tender of five yuan or more with banknotes bearing a chop, leaving only small denominations of currency below one yuan in circulation in the market. Only banknotes bearing a chop can be used to purchase foreign exchange in the future.</p>
<p>2. It is said that the National Government will henceforth make all principal and interest payments on public bonds in Chongqing, no longer using the method of "paying in Chongqing once and paying in Shanghai in six installments," in order to reduce the inflow of legal tender funds into Shanghai.</p>
<p>3. It is said that the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be gradually withdrawn, allowing the banknotes and miscellaneous currencies issued by the remaining eight legal commercial banks to circulate, and these non-Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications banknotes will not be eligible to purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<p>4. It is said that the existing legal tender foreign exchange stabilization fund will be divided among China, Britain, and the United States, and will only be supplied to China, Britain, and the United States. Ordinary needs will not be supplied for the time being.</p>
<p>These rumors caused some people in the market to be impulsive, which is really too lacking in judgment. First of all, the wise authorities would never take this inferior strategy of undermining the credibility of the legal tender. Because, if only banknotes with a chop are allowed to purchase foreign exchange, then the legal tender to banknotes with a chop will inevitably be at a discount. The legal tender at a discount is no different from the depreciation of the legal tender; moreover, the legal tender can still purchase foreign exchange after paying the discount and obtaining banknotes with a chop. How can the attempt of the pseudo "Huaxing" to absorb legal tender and seize foreign exchange be prevented simply by adding a procedure of converting to banknotes with a chop? Presumably, this rumor originated from the discount of the banknotes with a chop of foreign merchant banks. Foreign merchant banks use banknotes with a chop to avoid the complexity of legal tender calculations, but this cannot be regarded as the circulation of banknotes with a chop.</p>
<p>The second point is equally ridiculous. Even if the National Government wants to shrink the legal tender in the war zone, it does not need to harp on this old tune. Moreover, the government has always been determined to maintain its debt credibility; it will not revoke its previous promise, and the government can certainly restrict the flow of legal tender to Shanghai from other aspects. Why must it plan on the payment of principal and interest on public bonds?</p>
<p>The third point is also impossible. If the government withdraws the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and allows miscellaneous currencies to circulate, wouldn't it be tantamount to the government slapping itself in the face? The banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are legal tender, and those issued by other commercial banks are also legal tender. The former can purchase foreign exchange, while the latter cannot. Isn't this destroying the already unified currency system? Even in the Tianjin concession, there will never be a withdrawal of legal tender. On the contrary, when funds from North China fled south in droves, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Tianjin restricted Shanghai exchange in order to maintain the original circulation of legal tender in North China. Because if the legal tender is withdrawn, there will be no currency available for circulation in the concession, and then the pseudo-currency can take the opportunity to seize the circulation area of the legal tender. Would the government be so stupid?</p>
<p>Finally, everyone knows that the establishment of the legal tender stabilization fund is to stabilize the external value of the legal tender. Therefore, anyone who holds legal tender, whether they are Chinese merchants, British merchants, etc., can purchase foreign exchange if necessary. The holders of legal tender do have nationalities, but the value of legal tender is definitely not different due to the different nationalities of the holders. Therefore, it is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile to say that the legal tender stabilization fund will be divided among the three countries. There are many ways to prevent the inflow into the pseudo "Huaxing"! For example, not allowing inland products to fall into the hands of the Japanese puppets and not buying Japanese goods are all ways.</p>
<p>In fact, even without the above analysis, the stability of the market today and the recovery of various bonds can prove the incredibility of these rumors.</p>

<p>The published figures for the losses and damages suffered by Chinese textile mills, especially yarn mills, during the Sino-Japanese War are truly alarming. The work stoppages and destruction of factory equipment have an even greater impact on the welfare and prosperity of capitalists and workers, because the textile industry in China is an important industry that employs more labor and invests more capital than any other industry. The information we have obtained from various organizations, textile mill managers, foreign agencies, and custodians, or from various parties related to these textile mills, can be reliably trusted.</p>
<p>However, there are also some factory buildings that have been used by the Japanese army as military hospitals or general headquarters. Except for the Japanese, no one is allowed to enter. Therefore, the actual situation of these textile mills is almost impossible to know for sure. Only a rough estimate of the degree of damage to the buildings can be made. Regarding the machinery inside, it is difficult to know for sure. According to various sources, the Japanese army has transported the machinery and motors of Chinese yarn mills in the occupied areas of Shanghai to Qingdao and installed them in Japanese yarn mills.</p>
<p>The current situation of Chinese yarn mills can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Twenty-six mills have been forcibly taken over by the Japanese army and are now being operated by the Japanese army for their own benefit, with 681,960 spindles, 42,950 doubling spindles, and 6,244 looms.</p>
<p>The yarn mills in the three provinces of Lu, Jin, and Yu have all been taken over and are used to weave military uniforms or as military machine repair shops. These confiscated factories only employ Chinese coolies and ordinary workers. Some Chinese yarn mills managed and operated by foreigners have also been taken over. For example, the Dasheng Yarn Mills No. 1, 3, and 8, operated by the German company Arnhold &amp; Co., were forcibly taken over on March 3 this year. Although the German embassy has been negotiating with the Japanese side, there has been no result so far. In short, the Chinese-owned yarn mills forcibly taken over by the Japanese side account for about one-quarter of the total number of spindles.</p>
<p>(2) Some or severely damaged, and now being repaired by the Japanese, 8,007 looms.</p>
<p>Most of these textile mills are in Jiangsu Province outside the Shanghai Concession area. Chinese textile mills in Wuxi and Changzhou are completely included in this category.</p>
<p>(3) Five textile mills have been occupied by the Japanese army as military hospitals and general headquarters, with 276,830 spindles, 44,266 doubling spindles, and 2,115 looms.</p>
<p>Most of these textile mills are around Shanghai. The No. 1, 2, and 3 mills of Wing On Textile Co., Ltd., have all been occupied, and people of any nationality are not allowed to enter.</p>
<p>(4) Fifteen textile mills are operating normally in the Shanghai Concession area and areas where no war has occurred, with 437,562 spindles, 34,898 doubling spindles, and 2,610 looms.</p>
<p>Most of these textile mills are in the center of the Shanghai International Settlement and in the two provinces of Shaanxi and Yunnan, and have made huge profits since the start of the war.</p>
<p>(5) Five textile mills (including one large dyeing and weaving mill) are operated by the Japanese side, ostensibly according to the so-called Sino-Japanese cooperation plan, i.e., the Japanese get 51% of the net profit and the Chinese get 49%, with 42,328 spindles, 7,980 doubling spindles, and 1,500 looms.</p>
<p>The managers of these textile mills have compromised with the Japanese side and have made some secret arrangements. Three of them are in Shanghai, one is in Wuhu, Anhui Province, and one is in Tangshan, Hebei Province.</p>
<p>(6) Eleven textile mills have moved some of their machinery to inland cities such as Chongqing and Xi'an and to the Shanghai International Settlement, with 315,162 spindles, 5,600 doubling spindles, and 2,293 looms.</p>
<p>Most of these relocated textile mills have changed their names, and many are registered under foreign names or are operated by the Bank of China.</p>
<p>(7) The machinery of the No. 1 Hubei Yarn Mill, now including 88,160 spindles and 648 looms, is stored in a foreign warehouse in Hankou. The mill is currently in the custody of the British company Tolly &amp; Co.</p>
<p>(8) Eight textile mills are currently shut down in less favorable central locations within the Japanese-occupied area due to frequent attacks by Chinese mobile units or difficulties in transportation and communication, with 172,044 spindles, 8,400 variable spindles, and 920 looms.</p>
<p>The Hengda Yarn Mill in Pudong is said to be shut down due to the activity of Chinese mobile units, and other textile mills on the outskirts of Shanghai are also shut down for the same reason.</p>
<p>(9) Textile mills that were shut down during the war and have resumed operation since last year include: Chongxin in Zhabei, registered under British name, and Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu district.</p>
<p>(10) The following textile mills are said to have had their machinery transported out by the Japanese side: Hengfeng Textile Company, Shenxin Yarn Mill No. 7, registered under a British name, Dahua Dyeing and Weaving Company, all of the above are in Yangshupu, and Zhentai Yarn Mill in Zhabei registered under British name.</p>
<p>(11) The following mills have been opened in Shanghai since the war: Anda Textile Company, 15,000 spindles, Zhongfang Company, 26,000 spindles and 300 looms, China Yarn Mill, 15,000 spindles (all of the above are registered under British names), Guomian Yarn Manufacturing Company, 26,000 spindles, Defang Textile Company, 10,340 spindles and 128 looms, (all of the above are registered under American names), Rongfeng Yarn Mill, 10,000 spindles, and Feng Textile Company, 5,000 spindles and 150 looms, Xinsheng Yarn Mill, 10,360 spindles, Zhaoxing Yarn Mill, 8,400 spindles, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Mill, China Woolen Mill, 4,000 woolen spindles and 100 looms.</p>
<p>The machinery of the above mills did not come from inland cities such as Wuxi. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e125">Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth Amidst Rising Prices (Continued) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fuli</p>
<p>Reading Table 7, the number of Chinese textile machines has been reduced to such a large extent. Although the output of yarn and cloth does not necessarily decrease in the same proportion due to differences in thickness and types, it is easy to infer that the supply is not meeting the demand. Even when combined with what British and Japanese merchants own or occupy, as shown in Table 8.</p>
<p>Reading Table 8, it can be seen that the quantity of yarn and cloth that the country can supply, even if the people do not buy all domestic products, is reduced by about 40% compared to before the war. This one point alone already leaves a lot of room for price increases, let alone other various reasons. The reason why it has maintained a considerable high price until now is well-founded. To meet the needs of the times, there are still a considerable number of new machines ordered before the war and old machines moved from the war zone that are being actively set up in the rear and can be opened soon. In addition, Mu's hand spinning machines with machine properties, sophisticated hand spinning weaving, Guangshi hand spinning machines, and Indian spinning waterwheel spinning are being planned one after another. It is firmly believed that a considerable production time will be achieved in the near future. The market price of yarn and cloth, which is necessary for daily use, will also fall accordingly. Let's wait and see. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e126">Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Native Silkworm Cocoons Have Entered the Market; Cocoon Merchants Compete to Buy, Breaking the Price Limit; Shanghai and Wuxi Cocoon Collection is in Preparation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoons: Have been launched one after another. Native cocoons in Zhejiang Province have exceeded the price limit. In the areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, etc., the local varieties have reached the stage of dormancy and leaf opening, and are about to be placed on the cocooning frames. The progress is quite good. Now, based on communications from various places, the main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Zhejiang is located south of Jiangsu, and its climate is more temperate than Jiangsu. The sprouting of silkworms occurs earlier accordingly. Therefore, the spring cocoons are launched in the market about half a month earlier than in Jiangsu Province. This year, the native cocoons in various counties of Hangzhou Prefecture have all been launched in the market. The local varieties will be launched at the end of this month at the latest. The cocoon industry association has agreed to set a price limit of 45 yuan per dan for native fresh cocoons. The cocoon firms officially started collecting goods on the 18th. However, due to the unfavorable climate in Zhejiang Province this year, the humidity was uneven during the silkworm rearing period. As a result, the output has decreased. The cocoon firms have received very few goods in the past two days. The cocoon merchants, seeing that the silk market in Shanghai will not fall in the near future, fear that they will not receive enough goods. Therefore, each cocoon firm has released bids to solicit goods, and the market price has presented a chaotic situation. The total price of cocoons in the past two days has jumped from the limit price of 45 yuan to 52 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan. According to the opinion of people in the industry, the market price is still likely to continue to rise. It is expected that when the local cocoons are launched at the end of the month, the opening price will be as high as 80 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Wuxi</p>
<p>The cocoons produced in this county are best known in the southwest region. In recent years, the north region has also been rising rapidly. The silkworms in the four townships have all entered the stage of dormancy and leaf opening. From the time of hatching to the time of dormancy, the spring breeze is blowing gently, and the climate is mild. Therefore, the development process is exceptionally good. The silkworms are healthy and there are no symptoms of disease. If there are no major disturbances from the time of dormancy to the time of cocooning, they can steadily move towards a healthy state. According to investigations, the cocoons are very good this year in Zhangjing Bridge, Yuqi, Luoshe in the north township, and Shitang, Nanqiao, Fangquan, Xushe in the south township, near Jiangyin, and Zhang Miaoshe, etc. Among them, several places have already started cocooning. Because of the early and late hatching, the launch in the market also has a sequence. In the areas of Suzhou and Wuxi, the scales can be opened in early June.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai</p>
<p>The cocoon firms in the guerrilla zone leased by the silk manufacturers in Shanghai are busy preparing for the collection of cocoons and other necessary matters due to the imminent launch of new cocoons. The Shanghai financial community is also happy to provide assistance on the issue of silk cocoon deposits. As soon as the first batch of goods arrives in Shanghai, a loan can be obtained by pledging the warehouse receipt. The manufacturers then use the loan to purchase goods, and so on in an endless stream until the end of the cocoon season. This is not only of great benefit to the silk industry in Shanghai, but also indirectly benefits the prosperity of our country's export goods. Regarding the saying that all ports are prohibited from shipping goods, the factories in Shanghai are determined to do everything possible to deal with it, enduring the pressure. Recently, orderly plans have been made, and people have been sent out to mediate. Therefore, it is feared that the situation has eased slightly. (Xiang)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market in Shanghai was sluggish. As it was a Sunday holiday, very few members attended. The price was not quoted. It was heard that Yongfeng Gold Shop sold ten taels to Baocheng Gongji Silver Shop on the phone. The price was still 2,124 yuan. According to inquiries from money exchange shops, the selling price was still 2,124 yuan, and the buying price was 2,122 yuan. Transactions were also rare. The market trend remained flat and weak.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael in silver shops remained unchanged. Datonghang quoted 216 yuan, and Xintonghang quoted 214 yuan (the buying price was 207-208 yuan).</p>
<p>London, 20th: The price of British pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 6d per ounce.</p>

<p>London, Silver Market Telegram, 20th: The difference between near and distant months in silver futures narrowed by 0.0625. India and speculators made slight purchases, while Damu sold. The market situation was flat. New York Telegram: The spot price of silver in the United States remained flat.

<h3 id="e129">Grain: Changjing Rice Was Once Offered <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various origins arrived. From Hexia, there were Songjiang and Nangang No. 4 and 5 rice, 3,400 to 3,500 packages of car-wheel dumplings from Suzhou and Tongbang, and 500 to 600 packages from Changzhou and Wuxi. The market sentiment suddenly became active at the start of the morning market, and sellers began to quote prices one after another. Changgao Geng Hui was offered at 18 yuan. Later, due to the wait-and-see attitude of hoarders, the actual demand was limited. There were only sporadic transactions on this street, and the market trend became flat. Changgao Geng was actually sold at 17.9 yuan, an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. The same was true for other thick-grained and thin-grained rice. Du Yangbu sharp rice had a tight sentiment, but the market price did not rise or fall much. There was a continuous arrival of customer sharp rice, and people's hearts were more relaxed, so the sales were not smooth and remained stagnant. The price of Bianyuan remained at the original level, without any changes.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Rebounded with Production Prices <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Up 3-4 Jiao to 2.5 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of coarse white sugar rebounded due to the increase in production prices. According to a telegram from the Netherlands, the price for July and August rose by 0.30 guilders to 9.35 guilders, and the price for September and October rose by 0.15 guilders to 8.45 guilders. According to a telegram from the United States, the near-term price rose by 1 penny to 7 shillings and 2 pence for August, 6 shillings and 2.5 pence for December, and 6 shillings and 3 pence for March of next year. Therefore, the long-depressed situation of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was suddenly reversed. The spot price of the 24th grade coarse white sugar in the main warehouse rose by 3-4 jiao. Initially, 50 packages were sold at 27.4 yuan, and then 100 packages were sold at 27.5 yuan. The price in the outer warehouse rose by 2.5 jiao, and 200 packages were traded at 27.2 yuan. The price of re-export goods rose by the same degree, and 100 packages were traded at 19.1 yuan. Later, the price was called up by 3 jiao. 500 packages of Great Golden Money Mark cargo arriving on June 3 were traded at 19.3 to 19.35 yuan. The price of Taikoo car white sugar also rose by 2 jiao. The price of B Mark was initially 26.8 yuan, and then 400 packages were traded at 26.85 yuan, and finally 100 packages were traded at 27 yuan. 200 packages of DY Mark were traded at 26.2 yuan, and HX Mark rose by 1 jiao to 26.15 yuan. The prices of Dutch red sugar and car red sugar did not change. The price of Bengmian White Sugar rose by 2 jiao accordingly. Zhenji No. 1 was 27 yuan, No. 2 was 26.5 yuan, No. 3 was 26 yuan, and No. 4 was 25.5 yuan. The Chaozhou gangs, which are watching the price of domestic sugar, are reluctant to sell Jummian White Sugar, which has a gathering trend, and Qing red sugar is relatively flat. Other Jianbang etc. are also unwilling to sell urgently due to price disagreements, and all have the appearance of waiting for the opportunity.</p>

<p>Longkou rice noodles have been in short supply recently, and Nanyang gangs have also been active in buying them. They have been sold for 64 yuan, and they have been bought by a certain two shops, which makes them even more firm. Yesterday, the market even called for 70 yuan, although no transaction was made, which shows a glimpse of the tight situation. The base of Qingdao noodle cargo is also short, and the shops are selling at 45-46 yuan, which seems to be continuing to tighten.</p>

<p>Over 500 Boxes Were Handled Yesterday</p>
<p>The prices of various hardware products have softened one after another, but the market for tinplate is still brisk. This is because customers and manufacturers on this street are all purchasing, resulting in a shortage of circulating goods, and the standards have also been raised accordingly. Yesterday, the Tianjin Tobacco Gangs handled another 900 boxes, and the market price rose by 2-3 yuan compared to before. The current selling price on the market is 69 yuan for 170 pounds and 70 yuan for 180 pounds (both American goods).</p>

<p>Haifeng white coal has not been flowing in smoothly recently, and the digestion on this street has not been slackening, so the supply cannot meet the demand. Yesterday, the off-the-books market rose by two yuan. According to the internal price of the same industry, the price of Haifeng screened lump coal is 45 yuan per ton, and the price of raw coal is 43 yuan. The price is higher at the wharehouse and includes the cost of transportation. However, due to the needs of street customers, the sales are still strong.</p>

<p>Since the change in the situation in South China, the source of Galangal has been blocked, resulting in a situation where the supply cannot meet the demand. The selling price has also gradually increased. Until recently, the old stocks here have been sold out, and the sales of Dalang Galangal are the most. It is heard that a certain shop, in order to adapt to the current situation, has transported it from Hong Kong, and about a hundred packages have arrived before and after. However, the external expenses have increased, so the asking price has increased by another six yuan compared to before, and it has been opened as many as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Western Envoys Granted Audience with the Emperor <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Emperor has allowed Western envoys to pay respects, exempting them from performing the three kneelings and nine prostrations ritual. That the Great Qing Emperor is able to allow non-observance of the central rituals is truly the epitome of friendly neighborliness. During the Qianlong era, an English envoy named Macartney led an embassy to court, bringing tribute. Upon entering, China presented him with the ritual of paying respects. Macartney declined due to unfamiliarity. The Emperor issued an edict exempting him from performing the prostration ritual, only following the ritual of monarchs of other European countries when paying respects. Once agreed, Emperor Qianlong met Macartney in the Hall of Supreme Harmony. Macartney held a golden box, adorned with pearls, containing the English Emperor's congratulatory message, raised it with both hands, ascended the steps, and presented it to the throne. Thereafter, Macartney paid respects several times in the capital and Rehe, all without prostrating.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Chinese College has completed the rebuilding of its buildings on the southern side of the New Bridge, near the western side of the British Consulate. It has now engaged famous Western teachers and Chinese classical teachers to teach students, enabling them to understand both Chinese and foreign languages. All teaching methods are clear and straightforward. The head teacher is Englishman Ge. Classes are held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every morning. English teachers teach Western languages, writing, and mathematics. From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Chinese teachers teach Chinese studies. The college's books, both Chinese and foreign, can be borrowed and do not need to be self-provided. Paper, ink, brushes, and inkstones are all provided. The tuition fee is 60 taels per year, payable in advance for one quarter, 15 taels of silver for three months. Those who wish to send their children to study should contact the Taifeng Foreign Firm on Sanma Road to make arrangements.</p>

<p>Last month, in the urban and rural areas of Suzhou, a red light suddenly appeared in the sky at night, accompanied by a sound like wind, for three consecutive nights. Initially, everyone mistakenly thought it was a fire and went out to rescue, but could not find anything. Unexpectedly, on the sixth night, a similar firelight appeared in the southwest corner of Shanghai. Therefore, its strangeness is recorded for those who study things to investigate and verify.</p>
