<h3>英法政府答覆希特勒　重申賡續作戰決心　履行援波義務至公理伸張而後已　張伯倫斥責蘇聯舉動為絕無理由</h3>
<p>倫敦　首相張伯倫今日下午在下院對於戰事進展情形、作第三决之陳述、略謂上週所發生之事件、性質極為深遠重大、其及於戰事前途及其他各國之影響、目前尙難加以估計、本週中德方繼續向波軍壓迫、波軍仍竭力抵抗、目下波蘭多處仍在繼續抗戰中、波蘭尙據有若干安全地帶、可為抗戰之憑藉、例如華沙至今拒絕屈服於德國勢力之下、九月十七日會發生一事、對於東綫戰事顯有一種斷然之影響、是晚蘇聯大軍沿全綫越過邊境侵入波蘭、余對於蘇聯政府此種舉動殊不能稱之為出於意外、因蘇聯報章及無綫電中早有宜布、述及波蘭境內白俄羅斯與烏克蘭人之地位、此足徵蘇聯政府早作干預之凖備矣、回憶當日蘇聯致央大使西資爵士之牒文中、曾說明其對於英蘇兩國之關係、將採取中立政策、故英政府在此種情勢下、遂於九月十八日對蘇聯進攻波蘭事發表宣言、聲明蘇聯之舉動無論作何飾詞、皆無正當理由、此項事件之糾紛雖尙未充分明顯、但不論何種情形、皆不足以搖動英政府履行其對波蘭之養務及以全力作戰、而達到完成此項義務之決心云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院本日午後四時開會時、張伯倫首相發表演說稱、「英法兩國決定賡續作戰、國際時局幷不因德元首希特勒昨日之演說、而有所變更、至以過去一星期所發生之事變而論、其性質至為重大、其影響及於戰事前途曁其他各國態度者、一時尙難佔計、德國軍隊雖賡續壓迫波蘭軍、但波軍抵抗强敵不遺餘力、直至今日、波蘭境內尙有不少孤軍、據險抗敵、華沙守軍之不屈即其一例、迨至本月十七日蘇聯軍隊忽在波蘭東部邊境全錢推進、此事雖不能謂為盡出吾人意料之外、但共足以影響東綫戰事、實屬無可諱言」云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相頃於午後四時在下議院宣稱、關於蘇聯軍隊開入波蘭事、英國政府業於本月十八日發表公報、聲明英國決心履行對波蘭義務賡續作戰、斷不受外界之影響、此項立塲茲當重言以申之、至於德元首希特勒昨日發表之演說而論、全篇充滿誇張威脅之詞、此種發言方式、實非吾人所取、正由此種理由、德國當局甚難了解吾人、此際余雖以評論渠之演說為事、但仍保持吾國之習尙、平心靜氣出之、此種素養、未知德國當局亦能見及之吾、以言希特勒演詞內容、幷無何項新穎之點、國際時局亦未因之有所變更、張柏倫首相嗣又答自由黨議員曼德爾之詢問云、「英國政府此决作戰之目標、仍為組成持久的國際制度、俾得防止一切戰爭、幷用和平手段解決國際爭端、如是而巳」云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　官方人士頃宣稱、內閣本日晨問舉行國務會議時、曾經鄭重聲明、「法國已決定賡續作戰、直至公理戰勝强權而後已」、日來所發生之事變、絕不足以變更英法兩國之態度云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法政府對於希特勒昨在但澤所發演說、今日已發出覆文、略謂、希氏演辭之目的、無非欲在德國人民之前、指陳其作戰之不得巳、同時希氏之演辭、於英法之間亦極盡其挑撥離間之能事、但英國對於波蘭之保證、完全由於德國滅亡奧捷不守信誓之結果、且希氏之意、向欲摧毀波蘭而不以獲致但澤為巳足、國社黨所作波境日耳曼民族待遇問題之種種宣傳、完全與去年蘇台德風潮發生時所用者如出一轍、此次宣傳即足以反證希氏毫無和平之誠意、總之、英法二國決不容許希特勒獲致足使世界為其奴隸破壞人類自由之勝利也、（而十日美聯電）</p>
<h3>侵入波瀾國境　蘇軍賡續推進　北路佔領維爾諾　南路抵勒伏夫城</h3>
<p>莫斯科　紅軍參謀處頃發表戰報稱、我軍在波蘭境內昨向各路賡續推進、及至晚間巳佔領下開各地、（一）北路亦即由俄羅斯區鏖戰兩小時之後、業已佔領維爾諾威里那、貝爾多維柴、（在皮亞利斯多克城東面五十公里）潑魯的尼戈勃林、（在勃萊斯脫利多佛斯克城東北面）諸城、（二）南路亦即烏克蘭區、已佔領佛拉第米華林斯　索加爾、（在蒲格河上）勃洛第、波瀾加、羅迦丁、迪里那諸拔、此外我軍騎兵隊與坦克車隊業巳開始抵勒伏夫城東北部與南　云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德國官塲無綫電稱、蘇聯軍隊旣佔古蒂、凡與羅國接壤之波蘭邊界、乃全為蘇軍所有矣云、（二十路透社電））科夫諾蘇聯軍隊昨日進抵立陶宛邊境維維斯、並與立陶宛邊境衛隊交換敬禮、據報波蘭軍隊於蘇聯軍隊抵達前、將維雨諾各橋焚燬、並將城中各軍用品移往他處、蘇聯佔領維爾諾城後、在街上佈置平民民團巡邏隊並設置平民會議、其第一部工作、為組織平民軍隊、（二十日美聯電）</p>
<p>科夫諾　頃悉蘇聯巨型坦克車一隊於星期二晚衝入維爾諾</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯工農紅軍總參謀部公佈十究日作戰公報如下、『九月十九日紅軍各部隊繼續追逐波蘭軍隊、截至是日晚佔領下列各地、在北方西白俄羅斯前綫、於交戰二小時後佔領維爾諾鎭、又維里卡·貝萊托維茨（比洛斯托克東五十公里）·普魯夏尼·柯布林（布萊斯立托夫斯克東北四十公里）諾鎭、在南方西烏克蘭前綫·佔領伏拉狄米伏林斯基·蘇卡爾（柏格河岸）·布洛台·鮑布爾卡·洛加丁一及杜林那等鎮、騎兵及戰車部隊業已進至勒伏夫鎭之東北郊及南郊（二十日塔斯電）</p>
<p>、並迫使大部份之波蘭步兵向後退撇、又當蘇俄大軍未抵該地以前、槍砲之聲徹夜不絕、足見波蘭守軍抵抗甚烈、聞波蘭敗兵五萬人已於昨日上午八時許、越過立陶宛邊界、此外另有波軍三萬員名整隊進入立陶宛、當經該地當局解除武裝並加以拘押、彼輩均經櫛風沐雨、且巳呈現精疲力盡之象、此後避趨立陶宛之波蘭兵士其總數當達十萬人、（二十日美聯電）</p>
<p>波軍陷於重圍圖中箭頭指示德蘇軍推進之路錢</p>
<h3>法閣會議　批准各項軍事措置　自信必獲最後勝利</h3>
<p>巴黎　國務會議今晨開會、出勒勃倫總統主席、當將政府所擬定之「各項軍事的經濟的財政的措置、亦即用以賡續作戰直至最後勝利之各項措置」予以核准、並重行申明、英法兩國保有聯帶一致關係「日益密切」、此外、各閣員對於波蘭國英勇抗戰之所為、一致表示敬意、咸皆相信英法波三國、必能獲有共同的勝利云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　內閣總理達拉第昨日與高級軍事及政府官員會晤、據報該會决定、雖蘇聯侵入波蘭、然法國仍擬賡續與蘇聯維持常態關係、在蘇聯再表白該國態度前、該會决議將於今日提交內閣會議通過、（二十日美聯電）</p>
<h3>英國情報部　發表一文　指斥希特勒演辭　一派廢話與虛言</h3>
<p>倫敦　英國情報部頃以公報形式發表一文、反駁希特勒之言論、指其詞為充滿廢話與虛言、謂居於負責地位如希特勒者、竟信口開河、隨便亂說，殊使人驚異云、該公報將希特勒前所發表與昨所廣播之言論而比較之、謂希特勒昨日詞中言及波蘭巳故軍長畢蘇斯基、稱為有魄力而重實行之人物、曾與希特勒屏絕凡爾賽和的、但旋謂少數日耳曼民族備受野蠻待遇、而世界始終無言、要知世界始終無言、因自畢蘇斯基逝世日起主今春為止、希特勒無時不認其對波關係至為良好故也、一九三五年五月二十一日希特勒曾在議會中發言、謂渠承認波闌為偉大愛國民族之國家、而具有諒解與親善友誼、一九三八年二月一十日希特勒復在議會聲明、德國對波關係不獨有協的特質、且在過去一年中發生更友好接近之結果，而國聯駐但澤辦事專員亦人格高尙、並聲稱最足危害歐洲和平之但澤、業已喪失其危害之意義，一九三八年九月二十六日希特勒又言及波瀾謂、在過去一年中、已能與波瀾成立一種妥洽、而使衝突之危險銷滅十年云云、波蘭近巳目覩德政府破壞其在慕尼黑所給予的莊嚴保證之可恥行為、而希特勒所發德國在歐不再有土地野心之担任、亦屢决破壞無遺、今希特勒向吾人言蘇聯事、殆巳忘却德外長里賓特羅甫勸英反蘇時、渠所吿吾人蘇聯如何危險之言論、一九三七年一月三十日希特勒不曾在議會中痛斥布爾希維克主義為毒菌、請德國工人勿與此國際寄生蟲接觸而發生關係乎、是年九月十四日希特勒不曾在紐倫堡宜稱、不與蘇聯合作、非欲自己孤立、但欲保障自己乎、即在一九三八年二月二日希特勒猶在議會發表「世界祇有一國、為德國不欲與之發生密切關係者、即蘇聯是」之切實聲明、英國並無對德國婦孺作戰之問題、德政府業巳宣布德國有充分存糧、至於軍用原料輸入之限制、則非德政府所可合法指責之計晝、希特勒所述戰爭初起時之情形、亦與事實相反、德國決定作戰而期望英國不履行其對波義務、英國遲至德軍侵入波蘭兩日後、迄未接到德國覆文時、始以哀的美敦書送達德政府云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法報紙　評論一斑　德方抑鬱的心理　希特勒情見乎辭</h3>
<p>倫敦　希特勒演辭中、雖危辭恫嚇、謂有一種「秘密武器」可以制勝、但各報仍認為係老生常談、且有數報更以為此項演辭、並無答覆之價値、泰晤士報載稱、希氏之演辭實母庸答辯、祇須予以實際上之答復云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國報紙批評希特勒演詞、咸以希特勒不能掩飾其恐懼情緒為言、巴黎日報稱、挑起戰爭而期望戰事短期順利結束者、今若不為長期消耗戰爭之恐懼所煩擾、則此演詞、意義安在耶、此人今不能掩飾其恐懼矣云、秩序報載貝爾蒂那一文稱、希特勒不久或將向中歐國家展其外交手段、以期達其目的云、小巴黎人報稱、希特勒之演詞流露憂鬱情緒云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅馬靜觀　認為和平希望微</h3>
<p>雜馬法西斯方面對於希特勒之廣播演詞、不置批評、義人所抱和平運動及戰事早了機會之期望、現巳銷滅、一般羣衆固極欲置身於衝突之外、現却抱注視態度、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間各報對於希特勒在但澤之演說、莫不冠以特大號之標題、評論多側重於波蘭已不存在之一點、消息報稱、」我人對於戰事之前途、誠不敢預言、惟吾人僅知目前之時局、即須要各方以互讓之精神與善意、將問題求獲適當之解決、」羅馬民衆報稱、「就現勢而觀、裁軍和平尙有可能、唯戰爭若延長下去、擇徒然遭受多年之犧牲與痛苦、仍難望其獲有公正之和平也、」（二十日美聯電）</p>
<h3>美國觀感　德採取和平攻勢　非英法所能接受</h3>
<p>華盛頓　華盛頓方面認希特勒在但澤之演說、為安置預料中希特勒的和平攻勢之基石、此種和平攻勢、將由義國甚或蘇聯用外交行動實施之、一般人對於希特勒此决演說之興趣、不若以前數决演說之甚、前希特勒演說時、此間全國報業俱樂部輙有多人集聽、此次則聽者寥寥無幾、消息靈通方面相信希氏之演說、巳透露其欲避免長期戰爭之焦慮、但預料英法將拒絕和平攻勢、蓋希特勒之建議、將使波蘭受風分之禍、羅馬尼亞·匈牙利·南斯拉夫·亦均感受威脅、而不久將來、德國且將直接進攻英法領土也、負責方面不信共產與納粹有同盟之可能性、（二十日路透電</p>
<h3>德蘇瓜分波蘭　磋商劃界事宜　利害攸關難免發生摩擦　德派員赴蘇商軍事合作</h3>
<p>瑞士國京城　此間消息靈通人士頃宣稱、關於德國與蘇聯在波蘭境內之交界綫、雖經雙方代表進行談判、迄今尙未切　　定、今後因此發生摩擦，亦有其可能、據柏林消息、德國政界人士對此至為焦慮、而於蘇聯勢力之在波蘭擴展、認為性質重大、已超越所預料、且與德蘇兩國協定之原則、不相符合、察蘇聯之策略、殆在延宕時日、使最後協定遽難成立、同時則將德國所覬覦之某某地方、先行佔領、從而遺成一種旣成事實云（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞國塞諾蒂城此間一般人以為、德蘇兩國關於劃分波蘭「佔領區域一二層、並未確立何項協定、而德國與羅馬尼亞國之交通綫、行見為蘇聯紅軍所按制、查在戰事爆發之前、德國巳購進羅國大批小麥與煤油、其與羅國之商務關係、純以抵賬協定為基礎、德國令後倘不能以其工業品輸入羅國、則羅國亦必拒不供給德國之所需、今茲蘇聯軍隊業巳開抵羅國邊境、羅國旣不復受德國之直接威脅、自必以最堅決的態度對付之（二十哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德國陸車與空軍官員數人、昨晚乘特備飛機、自德國元目行營飛抵此間、據宣稱、渠等負有使命、與蘇聯富局討論德蘇兩國軍隊在波蘭合作之各項問題、（二十日海通社電）</p>
<h3>蘇羅接洽　重勘疆界　匈吾認與蘇軍聯絡　蘇南短期內將復交</h3>
<p>羅馬　據義國官方新聞社特的訪員稱、蘇聯與羅馬尼亞兩國軍官、昨日會晤於波羅邊境、當即商定組織軍事委員團、恢複邊境交通、該訪員又稱、莫斯科羅京間、將舉行直接談判、重定蘇羅兩國聞之新疆界云、（二十日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞國賽諾蒂城　羅國陸軍上校一員、本日午後領導代表團前往柴萊契基城、（在波蘭國東甫部）與蘇聯軍隊司令接洽邊界事務、並不磋商何項政治問題、至目前為止、波蘭國古蒂城尙未被蘇聯軍隊佔據、蘇軍司令並在佔據區域內、聽任波國難民避往羅國、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　義大利「斯丹芬尼通訊社」之特的訪員、今日自羅馬尼亞邊界發來報吿、謂蘇俄軍隊在羅馬尼亞毘連之波蘭領土、行動異常謹愼、極力避免侵犯羅馬尼亞之中立、俄軍司令宣稱、彼等奉到訓令、飭令絕對遵守羅馬尼亞之邊界、故昨日在柴萊契基有俄國坦克車兩輛、過失衛　羅國、蘇俄軍官立卽向羅國常局道歉（二十海通電）</p>
<p>匃京　謠傳蘇聯軍隊業已迫近匈國邊界、此間消息靈通人士均謂、蘇軍前哨開抵邊界、容或有之、但與匃國邊防軍並未作何正式聯絡（廿八哈瓦斯電）南國京城　南斯拉夫專使橋治維區、昨日自莫斯科返國、蘇南兩國可望於最近期間、恢復邦交，並於短時期內互遣使節、自一九二七年以還、蘇聯卽不派外交代表駐於南國京城、（二十日海通電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本突起反美宣傳</h3>
<p>一週以前，美總統羅斯福氏於稱述外交政策時，關於遠東方面，曾表示反對用武力或其他方法；對遠東地位作任何單獨變更，其意義即在堅決吾認日本所創造的所謂「遠東新秩序」。這個聲明之後，並未見日本政府有若何反響；迄日昨始由東京傳來消息，謂日本若千重要報紙。竟於同日著文警告美國，指美國欲繼英國而為遠東的「守衛的狗」，要求其改變對日態度，吾則便不惜以兵戎相見；字裹行間，充滿了憤恨和威脅的意味。在日本政府沒有正式表示對美態度以前，我們本不能僅僅根據日本輿論，而推測日本國家對美怎樣；惟日本輿論現在政府嚴厲統制之下，對於有關邦交的論述，自必特別愼重言解，今竟對於素所恭順的美國，施以强烈攻擊，這不能不視為必有所秉承</p>
<p>自中日戰爭發生以來，日本在她創造所謂「遠東新秩序一的過程中，對於美國眞是另眼相看：每遇美國在華權益遭受日軍破壞時：或則立即賠償，或則立即道歉，決不讓事件有擴大的機會。最近雖說美國廢止美日商的，停止購買黃金，將予日本在物質上受相當巨大的影響，在精神上受到一點刺激；但是日本目前還在希望重訂商的，在這個希望沒有完全斷絕以前，似乎不必出此恐嚇手段；而且新任日本首相阿部，又是以協和邦交爲當前的外交政策，如何上臺不久，就發生仇美的現象呢？</p>
<p>其實這種現象的產生，也還是於日本對遠東野心的積極發展；不過她的構成，却由於兩種錯誤的觀念：第一，日本誤認歐戰對於日本有利。以為英法旣已對德宣戰，業已無法顧及其在遠東的權益；而日蘇停止敵對協定的簽訂，又可以使對華侵略避免側面的軍事威脅。原來日蘇的停戰。未必能使日本對華軍事有多大的作甩，這點日本政府也已經明白地承認；惟英法的參加歐戰，她却認為是進行創造所謂「遠東新秩序」的唯一機會；在遠東有利權關係的國家，比較上以英法美三國為最重要，今英法旣己無法顧及遠東的權益，所剩下的祇有美國。因此日本以為祗要壓迫美國就範，她的所謂「遠東新秩序」就可以功德圓滿了。</p>
<p>第二，日本錯認了美國的遠東政策市可以放棄的。日本以爲美國所注重的，祗是利益；過去日本在中國對於美國僑民所予的小惠，自信可阻止美國不履行其在遠東方面所負担的條的義務；她以為美國無政治興趣以妨礙建設所謂「遠東新秩序」；並且自歐戰發生後，美國的重力案是否需要修正，已成爲目前美國國內政黨間德一大爭端問題，美國孤立派甚至提出「歐洲國界與我無涉」的口號，日本也想趁此機會，以日美戰爭來刺激孤立派的感情，要他們再提出「遠東局勢與我何關一口號，迫使美國放棄對遠東的干涉</p>
<p>可是世事未必盡能如人意。歐戰之影響於遠東的利害，就日本或中國說，以目前國際關係的瞬息萬變，實在尙屬不定之天！何况日蘇停戰未必能使日本專心侵華；而中國的作戰，又完全依賴自身的力量，年來軍事政治的進步，已能抵抗日本任何方面的企圖。至於美國的遠東政策、始終是堅持著門戶開放，和保全中國領土行政完整的兩大原則。美國過去不積極履行這兩大原則的義務，自有其複雜的原因，但決不是放棄。美國要堅持兩項原則的目的，同時也就是保護她在遠東的權益。歐洲的國界，古人可說和美國無關；而遠東的權利，却不能不圖保全。因爲這不僅是權益問題，並且還有關於美國本土的安全。在過去二年多的遠東戰事，有關美國權益的損害，已多達六百件以上，這豈是美國所能長此容認？美國最近增强太平洋防禦的力量，廢止美日商的，這不過是初步的報復手段；而日本却不自覺醒，反以威脅的口吻，企圖美國放棄在遠東的權益，這種妄想能夠實現麽？</p>
<p>現代戰爭的眞意義，已在日本試騐中：兩年來軍力財力的消耗，已把日本疲困到怎樣的地步！還有能力再發動一個新的戰爭嗎？倘使能夠的話，為什麼又要簽訂蘇日停止敵對協定？單以日本所需軍火而論，自歐戰爆發之後，唯一的來源就是美國；若美國一旦停止供給，不要說是對美作戰無由實現，連在遠東方面的行動，恐怕也就難於支持了。日本新聞界的仇美宣傳。祗是不理解美國態度的堅定，是無聯的嘗試罷了。</p>

<p>但澤　希特勒元首今日下午五時、在但澤市最大廣塲發表演說、首由但澤行政專員孚斯德致詞介紹後、希氏登壇演說、先對第一次立足但澤、表示欣幸、繼稱、本人蒞但、雖係初决、但在白人移殖紐的前五百年、但澤巳為德國所有、不幸世界大戰、使之與德國分離、而凡兩賽和的更使世界陷於混亂、煽動戰爭者及戰後結束殘局者、自欺欺人、如出一轍、彼等不惟未能解决任何問題、抑且從此種和平中造成無數之困難糾紛、德國遲早必崛興以解決上述糾紛、不過時間問題、其中最主耍之一事、乃當時之作威作福者、完全忽視事實、無論英國好戰者喜悅與吾、但澤人民依然健在、不能以一手掩盡天下人耳目也、而今擁有八千二百萬日耳曼人之德國、無論煽動戰爭者贊成與吾、此八千二百萬人具有共同生活之願望、即將共同生活、所有割讓予波蘭之區域、其發展得力於德人之工作老、依據當時舉行平民投票之結果、無人願為波蘭國之一部、然但澤終為瘋在者之犧牲、而波蘭國遂成缺乏理性之產物矣、</p>
<p>希氏復將二十年來波蘭之過去、加以評論、力言波蘭國之產生、乃由於犧牲千萬之赤血、犧牲日耳曼人墾殖之田地、犧牲一切理智與經濟之可能性而成、且波蘭人尙不能保持日耳曼人造成之文化、蓋世界上惟能造成文化者、始有保持文化之能力也、波蘭為多民族組成之國家、一與前奧地利相同、日耳曼人二十年來所受之痛苦、無須余加以詳述、一言以蔽之曰、「慘痛之事實而已」、</p>
<p>希氏至此提及常初欲遵循和平之途徑、解決波蘭問題之努力、以及與波蘭故大總統畢蘇資基上將所簽訂之協定、認為此項協定、乃促進德波兩國民族達到和平成立諒解之基礎、至少亦可利用凡爾賽和的、將計就計、謀求建立合理之邦交、當畢上將在生時、此項努力似已有成功之展望、迨畢氏一死、情勢大變、日耳曼人所受之壓制愈演愈烈、然全世界固熟視罔睹、充目不聞也、德國為一大强國、故容忍日耳曼人為决等國家所虐待、實為壓迫與反叛之情勢、而尤可譴食者、為下列各項情况、（一）阻止日耳曼性質之城市加入德國、而採用各種方法使之波蘭化、（二）與德國本部分開之省分、無直接交通與運輸、而須依賴波蘭之好意或詭計、世界各强國無有能容忍此項事態如德國之久者、</p>
<p>希氏提及渠向波蘭提出之建議、略謂、「余當時縝密考慮能吾負責向波政府提出此項解決方案、余所以提出此項建議者、為避免德波人民之戰禍也」、希特勒元首於詳述建議細目後、宣稱、「余不知波蘭拒絕此項建議之意向何在、然余知日耳曼人巳感覺寬慰矣、波蘭之答覆為下令動員、波蘭外長拒絕余之邀的、不肯前來柏林晤談、反前往倫敦接洽、故此後數月間、威脅繼續增加、終為任何强國所不能容忍」、</p>
<p>希氏繼述波蘭報紙常要求兼併東普魯士與波麥拉尼亞、並以易北河為波蘭疆界、波蘭深信倘其兵力不足以實現此項計劃、可獲得其他國家之投助、然各國視波蘭為完成目的之工具、目前已高唱主要問題為德國之制度而非波蘭矣、汝等當能記憶余在薩爾白魯根及威廉哈文之演說、余於此項演說中、提及某數國家、平民可以任意發表演說、高談戰爭之必要性、如邱吉爾·艾登·古柏等之所為、余指陳其危險、因不知渠等將於何時組織也、目前渠等已加人政府矣、余當時警吿德國人民、然確信德國決不屈服於渠等之威脅與暴行之下、戰爭運動在民主國家內逐漸發展、因言論之自由、對外國政府·政治家·甚至元首、均可加以攻擊·誹謗·與侮辱、而極權國家重紀律、決不容發生此種現象、戰爭之激動可以行之無紀律之國家、而不能實行於有紀律之國家、故無紀律國家之人民、被激動作戰、而有紀律國家之人民不知準備戰爭、故希特勒元首決定警吿民衆、置國家於防衛基礎之上、庶不致遭受襲擊、</p>
<p>希氏評述八月間之情形、略稱、「余深信倘無英國之保證與崇拜戰爭者之激動、當時可以成立諒解、英國建議德波直接談判、德國接受此項建議、而波蘭繼續拒絕」、希氏於數月之等待及屢决提出建議之後、乃決定「採用波蘭所明瞭之唯一語言」、希特勒提及義國之調解、謂「義國乃吾人之友邦、墨索里尼提出調解之建議後、法國已接受、德國亦同意、惟英國加以拒絕、而欲以二小時之最後通牒、向德國提出不可能之要求、然英國已誤會矣、今日之德國未可以一九一八年之德國視之、倫敦方面應認識不能以最後通牒、遞交今日之德國、德國決不容忍此項語調也、</p>
<p>吾知波蘭決定作戰時、以為在此次戰爭中、可獲政治與財政之利益、且為西歐政治家之統計所鼓動、即所謂德軍不足畏·德軍裝備低劣·士氣頹喪·人民均有戰敗心理·德國民衆與領袖間之對立是也、波蘭深信不僅可以抵抗德軍、且可擊退德軍、故於外國參謀人員協助之下、凖備對德戰事、然開戰僅十八日、而德軍巳進抵勒姆堡·勃萊斯脫之綫矣、古特諾區域之波蘭軍隊全部崩潰、盡被俘獲、昨晨俘虜數額為二萬、昨夜為五萬、今晨為七萬、全不知目前之數額、叉增至何種程度、但余確知勒姆堡勃萊斯脫綫以西之波蘭軍、倘不於最近數日內投降、必遭全部殲滅也、德軍巳敎訓此項聰明之政治家、渠等亦深知德國之狀况、斯米洛里資上將已走入錯誤之方向、與其他波蘭領袖相同、渠未飛來柏林而飛往捷諾維茲、波蘭士兵作戰勇敢、但下級軍官缺乏軍事學識、高級領袖則絕無能力、目前德國俘虜營中、有波蘭士兵三十萬人、其中有軍官二千將領數人、雖然、波蘭下級軍人之勇敢、固為吾等所承認、然而波蘭若干行徑、則其卑下為曠世所無、如日耳曼婦孺之遭遇虐待、挖眼割鼻、德國被俘官兵凌虐備至、波蘭政府之廣播電台巳經公然承認跳降落傘降落之德國空軍被波軍擊斃、然未聞民主國家之政治家對此種野蠻行動、提出抗議、此而可忍、孰不可忍、余願重言以申明之曰、此種局勢決不能保持長久、「今吾等已以十八日中粉碎波蘭、而產生可與波蘭民族代表、作合理而冷靜之談話之環境矣」、</p>
<p>希氏至此、暢論德俄合作、宣稱、蘇俄為保護白俄羅斯及烏克蘭利益起見、認為有進兵波蘭之必要、至於德俄之合作、德國保持其本來面目、俄國亦保持其原來作風、惟兩國同意一事、即彼此不互相作戰、以免西方各國坐收漁利、世界大戰中四年之經騐、吾等巳飽嘗之矣、今而後吾等决心保衛本身之利益、而兩國諒解、即足以使此種目標完全達到、蓋英國政治家屢次造謠、謂德國政治野心將囊括烏拉爾山在內、更謂彼等此决對德作戰、即為推倒此欲獨覇歐洲之政府、英國政治家顯然因之　不安枕、余今藉此鄭重昭吿英國政治家曰、德國决無征服烏克蘭之野心、蘇俄與德已經成立協定、英國對於德國之野心、已可無庸其焦慮矣、至於波蘭應如何構造、此事當由與生存攸關利益之德俄兩國自行决定之、德國有限制但不可改變之要求、已為全世所共悉、德俄兩國當盡力將引起歐洲燎原之淵藪、變為並無緊張之區域也、如西方各國不表同意、或英國决心進行三年五年之戰爭、則余之答復如次、德國已經接受現時疆界為最後疆界、余對英國或法國均無作戰之願望、自余秉政以來、余盡力與歐戰時各敵國樹立密切關係、消除德義間之磨擦巳經成功對於法國亦作同樣努力、薩爾間題解決之後、余即鄭重宣佈、德國西面疆界巳無修改之必要、對於英國亦曾一再努力、企圖建立誠摯睦誼、倘英國一味拒絕、眞欲對德作戰、則余可作下列答覆、</p>
<p>波蘭決不能回復凡爾賽條約之形式、不但德國保證如此蘇俄亦同樣保證、則英國作戰之眞正目的、非保護波蘭而係欲推翻德國現時政府、須知德國全國人民受國社主義之訓練、决不能接受邱吉爾古柏、艾登等所贊成之制度、如敵方果欲從事三年戰爭、余甚為法國軍人惋惜、彼等並無所求、僅知作戰三年之光榮而巳、倘果發生三年戰爭、則德國無論三年四年甚至六七年、决不屈服、英國自恃有優越之海軍、對婦　施行封鎖、彼等愼勿錯誤、蓋德國倘被迫施用一種武器時、恐英國海軍將不知措手足也、至於仆戰方法如何、吾等當視英國的方法面定、英國並非對德國政府作戰、而係對德國婦孺作戰、則德國亦將以英人之衛、還治英人之身、總之德國决不屈服、吾等决心周旋到底、但澤經二十年之分離後、今已重返德國、永不再與祖國分離、德國全國人民當以最後一息、加以保衛之也、（十九日海通電）</p>

<h3>供獻給　投考西南聯大的同學們（下）</h3>
<p>— （沈嘉猷自昆明寄）</p>
<p>同學初來、可在車站附近住旅店一脊、明天至總辦公處、將手續辦妥後再行搬入宿舍、較為妥當、本省敎育廳、設有靑年招待所、在福照街景虹小學內、同學有不願或不便住旅店者、可往該所接洽、</p>
<p>關於旅途方面、滬滇最短行程須七日、——滬港郵船二日、港越郵船二日、滇越車一日、（密許林快車）海防及香港各停一日、通常因等車船關係、常須二星期左右、港滬段若乘太古船須四日、中以汕頭最討厭、同學都非老於旅行、故此處行李易遺失、船將靠岸時、切將零星東西及行李放在一起、抱定「老口勿脫手」主義、待此輩挑夫也可說投機小偷、離去後、始能流覽風景、本人便是經過他們敎訓的一個、切望同學注意、到了香港你可看到些異國風味、護照須經法領簽字、山間檻車是香港別具風味的、可往一坐、九龍就在港對面、時間若許可、也可渡江一遊、港越段沒有像汕頭那樣的危險碼頭、但也不可太忽略了安南賊、倒底是外國貨、偷鋼筆、是門檻十足的、到海防可由妥善旅店照料行李、至海關驗查、旅舍中以天然較有勢力、行李可先查、查畢點騐無錯、你便算過了滬滇的一切難關、此時便可計劃乘車的問題、密許林雖快、但於有行李的學生不甚相宜、普通以四等慢車較省費而叉能多帶行李、車至河內或嘉林、須換車、後者可早到昆明一天、但前者的風物甚佳、玩玩也是得可償失的、到牢該、開遠、都須下車住店、行李可由棧房招待、倒可放心、沿途山洞很多、身體稍差的同學、宜備濕巾一方、以避煤氣、到牢該後、對面便是我國境界名河口、至開遠更可見到無數的壯丁、在訓練着、此時你便像顚沛在外的孩子、重歸家鄉一般、有說不出的愉快、可是當慈母式的戚友、向你揮帽站迎的時候、你千萬別害羞得說不出話來啦、</p>
<p>經過國外最要緊的還是護照、若在香港領、則須費去港幣六元照現在匯水算起來甚不合算、故若有親友在滇的話、還是託他們領、僅須四元、與港相較不知便宜多少、若有二位一起來、則不妨合拍一照、合領一張、費用可省一倍、</p>
<p>滬滇最難最麻煩之處、便要算海防的檢騐了、常致傾箱倒篋、遺失竟是意中事、且罰款又隨便關員高興、他歡喜的便拿了去、所以能省的東西便不妨少帶、新的東西允宜避去、但若必需的叉不妨儘多帶來、因昆價高得可怕、雖罰了有時還較便宜、查時小物件宜置箱底、重要的可放袋內、比較穩妥些、能說法語的同學、此時便可佔到極大的便宜、所以可能的話還望、隨帶一張法文的團體證明書、由學校署名、或可减少些麻煩、查時箱篋均由目己開、所以鑰匙須隨帶身旁以免臨時慌亂、中國旅行社、有旅行指南出版、一切購票、選船等事可資參考、若欲該社招待者亦可與其接洽、最後敬祝你們榜上題名、並望惠然早來、（完）</p>

<h3>金融　外匯起伏靡定　滙豐掛牌一致放長　美金暗市曾出七元</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況因美對英匯率突然轉漲、致本市滙豐掛牌放長、英匯長二五、達三辦士七五、美長六二五、為六元一二五、其他除德滙無市外、亦莫不一致放長、內槃晨開、局勢亦遂吿英緊美平之象、中途雖市上各種流言已漸消散、但因人心仍覺不定、故起落靡常、令人一時不易揣測、情勢大致先鬆後緊、初因華商與華行等爭塞甚力、並外行買胃不強、故市勢頗鬆、一度英金會硬至四辦士三七五、美匯亦衝出七元關口、鬆達七元一二五、嗣後某行吸胃徒健、乘賤猛吸、加之華商與華行等亦止賽力扒、故情況頓復回平、結果以英金四辨士二五、美匯六元八七五收盤、本月期貨、因交割期近、故遂見軋攏、有時外行賣價已與現貨相同、至十月份期貨、初亦隨之鬆硬、美匯曾長至七元、後亦漸漸回平、照午收現貨與十月差價英金低〇三一二五、美匯則距離一八七五、合月息（除佣）僅二分七厘光景、且實際上尚難獲得、故套利者絕跡、半天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>結果美平英略見緊</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期漲八七五、遠期長八一二五、紐的銀價升一分七五、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法均平、對滬昂三七五、美對英回長九分、對滬升七角、對法大五分、中央掛牌各匯如奮、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士二五、美匯六元八七五、較之前收、英緊〇九三七五、美則無榮辱、乃美英匯兌回長之故、開後某行首先吸進同行十月份英金四辦士二一八七五嗣日行結進外行現貨英金四辦士二一八七五、及現貨美匯六元八一二五、為狀略軟、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、英匯長二五、美匯大六二五、其他亦一致放長、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續升四分七五、此後華商突來猛塞、兼華行亦有賣意、並因外行吃胃不佳、故潛勢趨鬆、計華商吐予外行現貨英金由四辦士二八一二五、長至三七五、並現貨美匯由六元九三七五、硬達七元一二五、時華行上海售予某行十月份美匯七元、嗣後某外行突吸胃轉佳、且華行華僑等亦來猛、吸加之華商亦由塞轉扒、致形勢頓見回軟、計華商與華行相繼進外行現貨英金由四辦士三一二五、縮至二五、繼而叉與洋行扒進某行等美行現貨美匯自六元九三七五軟至八一二五、午刻為狀轉平、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士二五、美匯六元八七五、本月份與上價相同、十月份英金四辦士二一八七五、美匯六元六八七五、結果比上日、現貨英緊〇九三七五、美則無榮辱、本月份英貴〇六二五、美則反鬆〇六二五、午後週三無市、</p>

<h3>現金傍晚突然下降</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、因外滙頗多曲折、並以人心恍惚不定、當日變動仍劇、大致先傾瀉而後暴漲、惟初開尚定、晨開為三千九百十元、繼經某金號拉提、續高至三千九百四十元、嗣後外滙明暗猛鬆、引起賣風、錢兌業等紛紛照市出籠、加之散戶多頭亦大都求售、遂直向下瀉、暴落至三千七百五十元低盤、但為時甚暫、旋以某金號多頭乘低加碼、情況回高、不久受外匯回緊之鼓勵、兼上日和平空氣、大都均信自前尚難實現、再以香港帮驟起買風、故價遂反動猛漲、昂達三千九百九十元高峯、但因四千元眼價賣戶整擁、致漲風頓挫、午收為三千九百七十元、午後情勢稍定，初會退達三千九百四十五元、人後某金號代客猛進、再度高達三千九百九十元、惟結果以三千九百八十元收盤、較前回漲四十元、聞收後因有某項利空消息、突起跌風、回落至三千九百元關內、交易仍旺、的二千餘兩、銀樓師金終則掛小五元、海關金等呆定如舊、</p>
<p>烚赤起伏甚大</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開頗穩、開市做高十元、錢兌業五做十兩、為三千九百十元、開後某金號前來吸收、且聞外滙略軟、致價續高三十元、某金號進錢兌業三十兩、為三千九百四十元、後外匯突聞明暗均長、人心頓虛、錢兌業等競相猛塞、加之接受者頗缺、急轉直下、不久即傾瀉一百九十元、錢兌業售予金號十兩、價為三千七百五十元、時某金號吸胃驟強、力進百餘兩、價頓回起數十元、某金號進銀樓帮二十兩、為三千八百二十元、後加外匯轉緊、一時買氣更形蓬勃、香港帮亦來羅購、又回漲一百七十元、現金號進某銀號三十兩、為三千九百九十元、時限價四千元賣戶湧旺、致漲風頓被阻撓、立回落五十元、證券帮吐予金號錢兌業共五十兩、為三千九百五十元、午刻金號互做二十兩、復抬高二十元、為三千九百七十元、作午收價、午後初開略疲、開市做小二十元、錢兌業賣予金號二十兩、為三千九百五十元、繼現金號賣予某銀號一十兩、價為三千九百四十五元、時某金號代客力進、價遂抬高四十五元、某金號進錢兌業三十兩、為三千九百九十元、入後銀樓帮與散戶趁高爭前吐售、立回小三十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、為三千九百六十元、後某金號復興買風、叉漲起二十元、某金號進銀樓帮十兩、為三千九百八十元、作晚收價、結果比上日回漲八十元、全天二百四十元上落、詎於收盤後利空消息突傳、跌風叉起、塲外交易做小至三千九百元關內、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均群成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百九十五元、迨至九時四十分掛小五元、逾五分許、叉掛低五元、十時〇五分回上五元、十一時〇五分叉回高五元、十一時一刻再高五元、下午突然掛小十元、計大同行改懸三百九十元、新同行為三百八十八元、收進須減小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>印銀現貨暴長</h3>
<p>十九日倫教電、銀市大衆買進、少供給、市況堅俏、收盤後轉平、五金市塲照掛牌價有賣意、但進者大都觀望、大條銀，近期續漲八七五、遠期又長八一二五、紐的銀電、美現貨猛升一分七五、又孟買銀電、印銀市況參差、現貨暴漲九羅比、期貨均仍平定、成交單共計百五十張、</p>
<h3>外幣欲漲又止</h3>
<p>昨日外幣跌風已戢、惟中途起落仍頗倏忽、美金票於上午曾降至十四元二角、卒以十四元五角半收盤、比上日尚漲五分、英美金鎊各漲一元五角及二元、英金要亦升二元、香港票則跌一分、日金票亦小一分、朝鮮票降二分、其餘各幣尚穩、詎將傍晚、忽有利空消息之傳播、金價突然下落、外幣因亦隨之趨疲矣、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債堅昂　多頭獲利回出　午後稍轉疲弱</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況、人氣仍見鑒定、惟獲利了結者、亦頗不少、故市價猶未能奮勇邁進、且國際風雲變幻莫測、其有關於我國者甚大、故大戶方密切注視、以待正式消息、昨日經過先高後低、丙種雖曾衝出四十五元關、牧盤仍見退進、午前買進者、以二十號及二十五號、又大豐及同康號均有買進、大通及聯益稍有出籠、餘則散戶居多、午後人氣較疲、進戶巳稀聯益有繼續出籠、仁昌裕濟亦均有賣出、回小三五角、故結果略高二三角、成交總數的仍有一百餘萬元之多、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國華銀行股二十股、價為三十八元五角、</p>
<p>又眾業公所報吿、昨日股市、甚少變動、頃所宜布之會德豐股末决股息五元、適與一般人頂期之數相附、故被打消、而無特殊影響加諸市況、怡和紗廠股在最後半小時內、倏吿跌落、蓋據報邇來謠傳、將付中期股息之說為不確、且恐亦非最近將來之事、設無其他更重要潛勢滋生、則此種謠言、亦大足玩弄市場至若干時日、</p>
<p>倫敦十九日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、銀行股及橡皮股仍吿平靜，上海自來水A字股及保安保險股、今日初决開出、自來水價為十鎊、與上月底最低行市同、保安開價十九鎊、比前跌三鎊、其餘仍未開出、</p>
<p>倫倫十九日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍開英法借款等三種、行情平穩無變化、其餘仍未開出、</p>
<h3>紗花　流言紛紜　棉紗一片喊賣聲　雙馬步跌三十三元　地球亦小二十五元</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風允熾、實緣市上流言紛紜、人心不定、同時華南一帶客銷尚屬濡滯、所有採辦、皆係零星交易、市面一片散漫無勁氣象、一般虛浮之多額、受謠言空氣籠罩下、頗不寗靜、但實力充裕之戶、遇跌風劇烈時、依然拖進加碼、故二十支雙馬最低價曾達七百三十五元、旋以塌貨者復來收進、再回上二十五元、為七百六十元牧盤、目前狀況、應當回小一步、因原棉到貨踴躍、售價回鬆矣、</p>
<p>現紗展開、人氣虛弱、一片喊賣聲、開價二十支雙馬跌十五元、為七百八十元、棧單跌風較厲、為七百元、要跌二十五元、少頃聞黃金下落、賣氣瀰漫、步步下瀉、二十支雙馬現貨價跌至七百三十五元、棧單價為六百八十元、迨至收盤將近、以消息轉好、紗市隨之上升二十元外、查半日成交統計一千二百七十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十三元、雙地球跌二十五元、五漲跌十元、牧羊跌七元半、茲將各幫口賣去之額列左、</p>
<h3>蘇北來源無阻　白包花　下跌十元</h3>
<p>本日白包花交易、繼續不懈、但銷路不及昔日之旺、市價續趨下游、忽落十元、蓋以蘇北一路來源通行無阻、以後且有湧到希望、揆其原因、謂內地售價奇廉、如果販運抵申、獲利之豐厚、莫可言喻、乃大衆爭相搜羅、粉紛運輸、因之近日到貨踴躍、至於廠方視來源無阻、辦意鬆懈、故本日碼頭續到三四千包、大家觀望不前、開價擯持至午後才做開、盤子比上日跌去十元、尚未能如數售罄、又有一說、大致賣淸、查棉價下跌、並不足奇、因二十支雙馬棉紗二日來已跌至百元外、通花頂尖貨開盤至一百六十元、設使一百四十二元、不過跌去十八元、如將棉紗作比例計算、前途尚有下跌可能也、並聞各路直向上海方面輸送矣、但據市上言、福家購辦之棉、大概運往靑島紗廠之用也、昨由北沙來花八百六十包、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因各方謠傳殊盛、人心因之靜寂、各方俱暫抱觀望、惟日廠商訂購新棉交易尚稱踴躍、較之數日前則已減色不少、昨日白洛區喊價為一百七十二元、平果兒一百二十五元、交易者寥寥、大衆意見、棉價日內繼續見漲、故同業均不願廉價出售、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的晨初因大衆賣出、市價較疲、跌落四五磅音、後因華爾街股票較堅、棉價亦略見回漲、直至收盤時、售價與上日無甚軒輊、印度速同預測跌四羅比、埃及跌三十餘磅音、利物浦亦回跌十餘便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　新秈整批到滬　客販急於脫貨　開價紛紛下跌</h3>
<p>杜粳昨日各帮來源河下仍無到、惟車輪包子續來各地新貨七千餘包、到貨既絡續不斷、人心遂更覺虛餒、兼之日來平糶關係、店家門市廖落、而銷塲亦不振、客販際此手中懷貨多者、遂均以急脫為快、早市開手形勢即疲、後則一路下跌、未見回風、結果厚粳小一元左右、各新尖亦小一元至元半、計特常粳四十一元、特錫粳三十九元、高三十七元、中三十五元、蘇同崑粳三十四五元、河下早晚稻以日來無到較為堅固、故略小半元之譜、是為三十一元半至三十一元、原包則為三十四元、崑山閔行顓橋及周浦新粳以到貨頗旺、身骨既軟、庶難久守、故降跌有二三元之巨、計崑閔顓粳三十元至二十九元、周浦粳二十八九元、崑山香粳以時令妙品、且為數祇二三十石、故開四十元至卅九元、崑蘇嘉興嘉善新羊尖二十六元半至二十六元、團尖二十六元至二十五元半、菱白尖二十七元至二十六元半、江北新尖二十五元半至二十五元、蕪湖新尖二上五元半决至二十四元、陳尖二十五元、變元三十四元、香港高團粒糯三十五元、中尖粒說那十四元、統市成交數五千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈前市轉站後、昨以江北新秈等叉有整批抵埠、且江浙杜秈亦由車輪湧到、進戶納胃頓懈、而貨方以邇日市上謠言甚熾、深恐今後交通便利、各路新秈湧到、更多貶價求脫、因此昨日中决各釉反跌近元、高檔亦小半元以上、高客秈二十六元、中决自二十五元至二十三元五六角不一、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　開七元現鈔　小麥亦不振</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日現粉廠盤貶跌二角、售開七元現鈔、蓋緣連白本街實銷平淡、南北兩帮客胃亦以前辦之貨、均須待裝、新交易不濃、更受日粉傾銷影響、各廠不得不稍事遷就、聞回籠貨亦隨廠盤鬆落、巳跌進七元關內、洋粉亦以國外電訊報小、售價無形帶鬆、統市本客成交併計的二萬包弱、麵粉今日有五千包、運往新加坡、</p>
<p>小麥咋市更形萎頓、蓋因連日到貨絡繹不絕、而廠胃觀望、行囤袖手、雖有日廠之收貿、而抑價甚嚴、市面一蹶不振、</p>
<h3>南北貨　津紅棗缺貨</h3>
<p>天津紅棗、因市存已缺、不久將罄、故行盤呌價奇昂、棗王須二百元、棗頭一百六十元、頭戶一百二十元、二戶七十元、店家均嫌過昂、尚乏成交、聞後貨客方開價、亦將改售現鈔云、</p>
<h3>油市　日商頃拋期豆油　再跌二三元</h3>
<p>豆油市況、在利空消息籠罩下及日商兜拋期油之影響、（期油曾受上半年之教訓故少染指、）致辦胄不開、市氣大挫、較上日最低價叉跌二三元、祇成交神戶油八十桶、（價為五十七元四角、）及大連油二十桶、（價為五十六元八角）而巳、</p>
<h3>疋頭　門市秋銷發動　客辦亦旺　貨價則跌</h3>
<p>國布昨布市續趨下游、緣謠諑繁興、人心忐忑、囤戶意向偏於賣出、兼以溫州復航已遭挫折、昨雖仍有試航舉措、希望已微、布市經此影響、售盤又步步下降、白貨細布細斜粗布回跌每疋一角至五角、漂染布跌每疋二角半至一元、絨布及不退色布價較穩定、本街門市秋銷發動、營業頗盛、惟以貨價回挫、各貨除急需者外、暫取觀望態度、蘇北舉寗秦州及蚌埠高邱各地需胃奇暢、成交嗶幾綫呢色布印花布五千餘疋、南洋帮香港帮辦粗布細斜紅洋標花布漂染布三千數百疋、粵帮甬帮辦色斜色布綫呢等貨一百餘箱、查布疋今日有一百十七件運新加坡、</p>
<p>東疋晨市白貨跌勢殊猛、蓋以紗價在落、囤戶恐慌、爭先賣出、龍頭細布最小盤售過每疋廿一元六七角、後市因本街同業心思仍好、乘廉搜羅、成交細布細斜四五百件、價乃逐步回升、結果龍頭細布為廿二元一角半、細斜廿一元、四君子嗶嘰掮客手貨現出每碼祇六角五分、而行開下月期貨則須七角五分、頗有吃戶、故市勢雖疲猶堅、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖再跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市因謠風未息、趨勢依然下游、公曾劃盤二四粗白、本棧五十四元半、跌二元三角、外棧初劃五十四元、最小到五十三元、後稍堅為五十三允半至四元、結果跌二元半、轉口持原價、太古車白B嘜初由六十元至五十九元半·五十九元·五十八元半、最後為五十九元、跌去三元、H嘜車赤為四十三元·四十二元·四十二元半、小二元五角、荷赤現貨四十四元、小二元、轉口三十七元、小一元、本綿白小一元半、振記一號五十五元、二號五十四元半、三號五十四元、四號五十三元半、一號冰降四元、為六十六元、晶明冰六十七元半、國糖雖以來源稀缺、呌價仍昂、但行方以價高市危、未敢貪進、致乏成交、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛皮高至八百元</h3>
<p>白鉛皮銷路、向以電池廠為最廣、而本街建築帮及茶棧帮等採辦亦不少、惟外埠客商、僅寗波及溫福諸帮略有點綴、但祇二三十桶而已，查目歐戰爆發後、該貨來源頓斷、（按白鉛皮產地為波蘭及比利時、）滬上存底不豐、故一般執有該貨者、心思頓硬、標準節節喊高、刻市如二號每桶售八百元、三號七百八十元、四號七百七十元、五號七百六十元、六號七百五十元、七八號七百四十元、九十號七百八十元、厚花色開價亦在八百元左右云、</p>

<h3>英日軍方區　準明日變更界限　河南路為雙方界綫　工部局昨發表正式消息　日偽昨日又搶佔愚園路藜照坊</h3>
<p>日本對上海租界區域、伺隙而動、為時已久、徒以國際關係複雜、未能為所欲為、自八月十九日滬西金洛克事件發生後、日方即支持偽組織、開始進行攫取越界築路管理權、迨九月一日歐戰暴發、三日英法對德宜戰、日方行動、益見積極、六日要求英法撤退駐滬軍隊、九日派為警侵入越界築路、十四日要求各國駐軍司冷、調整防區、內容雖未允宣洩、而公共租界英軍防區、實為日方目的之一、一周以來、即盛傳蘇州河北英軍防區或有問題、迨至昨日、事實表現、一則為蘇州北英軍防區、確有一部份自明日起、轉讓於日方、業經英日兩方證實二則滬西越界築路日偽方面行動、愈益囂張、咋日又佔愚園路藜照坊、當局雖不甘放棄警權、但對日偽橫暴行動、亦無如之何、除加派警探及警備車戒備巡邏外、似尙待此案之獲得合理解決、茲誌昨日情形於後、</p>
<p>防區變動業經證實</p>
<p>據工部局宣稱、自本年九月廿二日起、「甲」區（日本海軍陸戰隊防區）與「乙」區（英軍防區）間之界綫、將改為北河南路、即恢復一九三七年以前原有之界綫、北河南路仍在英軍防區以內、此决變史界綫所牽涉之地段、僅有一小部份、即北至靶子路、東至北江西路、南至蘇州河、西至北河南路、現在北江西路所有之鐵絲網架、仍置原處、並不遷動、上項改劃界綫辦法、業經各該海陸軍司令同意、在牽涉之地段內、行人母須通行證、亦不受任何限制、工部局捕房繼續執行警權、惟有時當可見日本海軍陸戰隊士兵在該處巡邏、預料該地段內之居民、不致因此决變更界綫而感受任何不便、各該居民將受充分之保護、</p>
<p>英日雙方</p>
<p>據日軍發言人前日在招待西報記者席上稱、北江西路至北河南路間、戰前本由日軍駐防、戰後日軍放棄、由萬國商團及英軍入駐、至本年六月、日方向英軍當局要求恢復戰前原狀、迭經交涉、雙方巳於本月十一日成立協定、的定英軍於廿二日起讓防將北江西路東端之隙碍物移去、而允日軍展長巡邏區域至北河南路為止、此完全係英日雙方間之防區問題、與九月十四日日方在虹口所邀集之防務會議之調整防區計劃、絕無關係、</p>
<p>租界警權照常行使</p>
<p>外國消息靈通人士稱、最近日方對於江西路至北河南路一段防區、要求劃歸日軍管轄、經日方與英軍當局、數度接洽、現已成立諒解、自今日起、英軍即由該段撤退、惟該段警權則仍如舊、所有工部局巡捕、依舊行使警權、日方在北江西路之障碍物、亦不移置於北河南路、居民無執有日方通行證之必要、故大體無甚變動、惟日軍今後有權在該段巡邏耳、</p>
<p>日軍以往測量地形</p>
<p>前日下午三時、曾有英軍一人、伴同日軍官四人、同乘汽車一輛、在天后宮橋北堍下車、測繪北河南路東段之地形、大中社記者為明瞭實地情形、昨日下午七時、曾再赴該區視察、見一切情形如舊、北江西路海寗路口、北江西路底靶子路口、北河南路界路口、西藏路海寗路口、昨日英軍尙未撤退界路以鐵絲網封鎖如故、日軍駐守界路西北荒烟蔓草叢中、天后宮橋山西路橋間之北蘇州路上各鐵舖、前日一度紛紛搬運貨物、昨日已無此種情形、想係明瞭日軍目前所欲開入者、為北河南路之東段也、</p>
<p>董事會中並未討論</p>
<p>工部局董事會循例每年暑假休會、現已期滿、於昨日下午四時牛、舉行第一决會議、一般意見、以為此决會議席上、對常前租界各種重大問題、如越界築路交涉、調整各國駐軍防區、當局必有報吿、提付討論、茲據大中社記者探悉、議程中所列僅兩案、（一）六家外字報紙（包括英文四家日俄文各一家）聯合致函工部局、反對將公佈文件交字林西報獨家發表案、（二）為一出賣公地案、對租界問題、絕未提出討論、（按工部局董事會向例、凡未列入議程中之案件、概不討論）、</p>
<p>探捕偽警雙方對峙</p>
<p>曹家渡一帶、前日偽警佔據租界巡捕所駐崗位、指揮交通、昨日仍未撤退、但在偽警駐崗處、加派華印探捕三名駐</p>
<h3>上海與歐美間　航輪運費高漲　美洲增加百分之五十　歐美加至百分之二十　中途如遭意外概不負責</h3>
<p>自歐洲戰爭發生後、交戰國之航業、影響至鉅、一部正班航輪、均巳奉令停駛、不定期之船隻、雖仍行駛、但船期皆守秘密、至各中立國船隻、雖可照常航行、惟亦冒險經營、故運費自滬運美、已增加百分之五十、自滬運歐、亦加百分之二十、、中途如遭意外、船公司不負責任、昨日荷商渣華郵船公司亦通知客家、謂在歐洲戰事時間、對於裝載該公司各輪之貨物、如發生意外、不能負責、</p>
<p>守、與偽警對峙、但並不指揮交通、亦未與偽警發生衝突、昨日裝甲車·警備車·中西探捕印捕馬巡隊、在各處往返巡邏、檢查行人、終日未懈、</p>
<p>藜照坊前幾釀衝突</p>
<p>愚園路四明別墅中實新村、現仍由兩偽軍守崗、漁光村對面錢家巷、本駐有偽警六名、昨日則已减至二名、豐田紗廠職工宿舍門前自九一八、由偽警四名駐守後、至今尚未撤退、白利南路口前亦駐有偽警六名、咋日亦巳减至兩名、九〇九號之藜照坊、於昨晨十時、駛來日卡車一輛、載日憲兵二名、偽警六名、突將該處佔領、在坊前布防、時適有捕房紅色警備車一輛載中西探捕十餘名、亦駛抵該處、見狀全體持槍下車、迫令撤退、日偽憲警、亦拔槍相向、雙方對峙甚久、形勢嚴重、幾乎釀成衝突、現駐防仍由日偽佔領駐守、愚園路一帶、捕房警車探捕、來往巡邏、緊張狀態、依然未減、</p>
<p>居民出入大感不便</p>
<p>極司非而路十五號秋園隔壁義生康記木行門首偽警四名、於十一日撤退後、昨日又至該處布崗、三義坊前日曾駐有偽警四名、昨日亦已撤去、靜安寺路一七六〇號門前偽警增至八名、防範較前嚴密、大西路王家弄口（白宮殯儀館隔壁）、於昨日突有武裝偽警六名、前往駐守、居民出入、均感不安、</p>
<p>租界邊區檢查綦嚴</p>
<p>海格路四四八號林氏巨厦、大門側門本各置有沙堡、最近日偽將側門前之沙堡拆去、加堆於大門前、已於咋日竣工、至側門則自沙堡拆去後、巳加封閉、現門前守衛偽警、亦已增加兩名、共為八名、並將槍械平置沙堡上作放射狀、附近形勢、甚為緊張、捕房之裝甲車及巡邏隊、不時巡邏該處、對行人車輛、檢查綦嚴、</p>
<h3>駛南北洋英輪　航程嚴守秘密　意論仍駛歐亞航線　能否達重點難逆料</h3>
<p>歐洲戰事爆發之初、各國商輪曾暫吿停航、旋夾輪奉令復航、其他中立國輪對於南北洋及北美州各航綫、亦均照常行駛、惟開往歐洲方面者則絕少按期駛出、允其各交戰國及與交戰國有密切關係之各輪船、為避免敵方潛水艇破壞及慎重行旅安全起見、均已停航或縮短航錢、大光社記者昨向中國旅行社探悉、意國郵船公司之康悌卑安克馬諾號郵船、原定於本月十四日開往歐洲、嗣因故在滬停滯、今該船以積貨過多、業改定本月二十四日自滬關往歐洲、客票手續、刻巳開始辦理、對歐洲航錢是吾能到達終點、目前尙難逆料、聞日來接洽搭乘該輪至南洋方面者甚多、但對於往歐洲者則為數極少、該輪於十二日抵滬、將客貨卸淸後、即駛往吳淞拋泊、定今晨七時開回公和祥碼頭停靠、裝儎出口貨、</p>
<p>怡和太古航運減色</p>
<p>行駛中國治海口岸之英國商輪、曾一度奉令停駛、旋即複航、惟船雙進口嚴守秘密、出口亦難準確、至於北洋綫、怡和洋行各輪照常行駛、但太古公司班輪大為減少、考其原因、由該公司唐古無正式貨棧、故客家雜糧、不裝太古、該公司華南綫貨運、較北洋綫略有起色、但因運費均結算港幣、亦略受影響、</p>
<p>不定期船客貨滿載</p>
<p>至不定期之船隻、仍以國幣計算、因此利市三倍、最近有洽成公司經理挪威商輪保衛克號、儎重三千噸、定二十四日直放香港、三天可到、提貨隨客家之便、叉通順與中威兩公司合辦經理之永貞輪、亦准二十四日開往香港、兼赴海防、聞兩輪客貨均已滿儎、</p>
<p>經考慮後德倫駛鎮</p>
<p>自歐戰爆發後、德商北德號亨寶等輪船公司、行駛遠東航綫各輪全停、惟行駛中國沿海口岸之德輪、奉令停止駛出中國領海三公里外、今行駛長江下游之德輪、因在中國領海以內、故均照常行駛、但駛滬鎭各輪之行駛問題、經各公司考慮後、飛康巳於昨日駛鎭、哈納定今日駛鎭、</p>
<p>祥泰抵滬神佑泊歐</p>
<p>溫州航線自日海軍揚言於十七日晚起封鎖溫州灣後、英商怡隆公司之神佑輪於十八日照常駛溫州、咋已接船主電吿、已安抵甌江口、何時進口來電並未提及、泰昌祥行代理之英商新祥泰輪、於十八日晨離溫駛滬、於昨晨安抵上海、裝來木炭土紙等貨及旅客、但此後是吾再駛溫州尙未决定、因目日艦在溫口外佈雷後、航行頗為危險、英輪永泰本擬駛溫、亦改航鎭海、</p>
<h3>上海郵政局　嚴禁信差需索</h3>
<p>上海郵局消息、郵局對於信差需索酒資或節賞、懸為厲禁、如遇有上項情事、各界可嚴予拒絕、一面將情形及該郵差制服號欺、函告郵局、以憑懲處、</p>
<h3>美運輪業巨額負責　改組公路制度　從事調整西南公路運輸　經費由貨華借款中發出　「吉興」氏已與華方接洽妥當</h3>
<p>大陸報云、據芝加哥每日講壇報載稱、美國之卡車駕駛夫一人、赤手空拳奮鬥、而巳在美國運輸業中致富者、將親自負責改組中國之公路制度、該駕駛夫名吉興、即令之芝加哥吉興橫貫大陸汽車運貨公司董事長是、</p>
<p>接洽緣由中政府駐美貿易機關之督辦陳君、於八月間與吉興公司接洽妥當、此項計劃之經費、將由去歲十二月美國經進出口銀行而貸華之借款二千五百萬元中撥出、吉興旣負責改組緬甸公路與海防至重慶公路之運輸、乃先派薛恒與該公司其他兩員啟程、八月杪抵華、或謂吉興公司之服務、係美政府介紹、惟陳君已否認此說、謂渠因商務關係而專吉興云、</p>
<p>主要任務吉氏之重要任務、為加速自緬甸與越南至重慶兩公路上之交通、另一部份工作為調整公路與仍在中政府控制下鐵路上之運輸、吉興氏等將遇之嚴重問題、為自重慶駛返沿海地點之空卡車如何加以利用、以運輸桐油等出口品、聞目前之運輸制度、費時耗貲</p>
<p>訂購卡車中國近向美國購卡車三千輛、復有二千輛、刻在談判中、業已運出之卡車、大多已抵海防與仰光、供給此等卡車奢係克雷·斯勒·通用·等三公司、代中國購卡車之環球貿易公司副董事長雷恩聲稱、此等卡車將用以載運出入中國之任何種貨物、大部份商業取道通仰光之公路、近雖降大雨、惟該路情况良好、通海防之公路、亦不受雨水之影響、</p>
<h3>美水雷艦　自青來滬</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國亞洲艦隊水雷敷設艦芬區號、夏季例泊靑島、現已起椗來滬、明日（二十一日）午刻前後可抵埠、該艦泊滬期限未悉、預料為期不久、即將駛往菲島、</p>

<h3>英法無暇東顧　日進行新陰謀　極圖與中國結束戰事　獲取英法在遠東利益　惟對美國則異常顧慮</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據本埠非官方日人傳出消息、日本有勢力政界、允其為日海軍之黷武軍官、刻正在熱以經營蘇德義日中五國同盟、日人之主張此種新外交政策者指稱、此項同盟、最有利於日本、</p>
<p>結束戰事企圖南進</p>
<p>因可同時解決日本之兩大難題、（一）由此遂步與中國休戰、傳結束遠較日本初料者為長久之戰事、（二）日本由此將處於一種地位、得阻美國協助英法而參加歐戰、並可開始海軍行動、其結果日本或能佔據香港·法屬越南。甚至富饒之荷屬東印度、申言之、英法今方有事於歐洲、日本將能強奪遠東之英法利益是、</p>
<p>對華條件將再讓步</p>
<p>聞贊成此新行動之日本政界、甚至準備以較前所求者、大為溫和之條件與中國停戰、彼等之意、以為日本既奪英法之遠東利益、則所處地位、諞後可向中國強提更苛刻之條件、日本政界並稱、即使中國拒絕加入同盟而寧願繼續抗戰、日政府雖必須駐大軍　於中國前綫、因而受妨礙、但仍可進行新政策、</p>
<p>連日謠言必有原因</p>
<p>據本埠日人指稱、莫斯科商妥蘇日休戰、終止「滿蒙」邊界一帶之戰事者、僅係向此目標前進之初步而已、今蘇日既有締結互不侵犯條的之可能、日本刻乃從事對華媾和之努力、俾使五國同盟計劃之實現、較近一步云、謠傳前日相近衛在職時曾宣佈五點和平條件者、今在香港與中政府領袖接觸、並謠傳受中國共產黨擁護之中政府領袖之一宋子文氏、巳飛莫斯科兩說、重慶雖巳吾認、惟觀察家以為此說之傳布、必有若干原因、與此等發展相關者、</p>
<p>承認國府請求休戰</p>
<p>汪精衛頃又電蔣總裁與中政府其他領袖、呼籲和平、其電文中顯著之特點、為不復斥責重慶之共產黨、而汪氏往日則指彼等為「保衛與勒逼」蔣總裁、同時、日方之新申報、複刊主張中日和平之社評、若干方面聲稱、日本或至少一部份日本政治·軍事·與海軍之有勢力領袖、亟欲停正在華戰事、俾開始更有利益之新冒險行動、日本將復承認重慶政府、以交換休戰與同盟、惟將堅持汪精衛復職、</p>
<p>重慶尚無確切表示</p>
<p>日本並將同意除駐兵數師於大城市外、撤離在華日軍、及至少暫時接受重慶領袖所主張之「經濟合作」、而非日方此前所求之經濟上的統治、但尚未擬定確切之和平條件云、重慶對於所傳日方建議之反響、猶未可知、惟確悉東京與重慶無論有何接觸、尚在萌芽階段、聞一部份日本領袖反對此種激烈之新政策、蓋恐將與美政府起直接衝突、而美國艦隊今仍泊太平洋中也、</p>
<h3>生活繼長增高　工商局續加津貼　自百分之廿五增至百分之四十　業經董事會通過定十月起實行　—全年約需七十五萬元—</h3>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>讀書偶解（上）</h3>
<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>唐中和四年，黃巢被勦滅了。當黃巢底人頭獻到皇帝面前的時候，還有一批降了「賊」的貴族婦女也被帶來了。皇帝問道：「你們都是受了皇家底恩典的，為甚麼要降賊呢？」那為首的女犯答道。。「國家有百萬的人衆，也還要失守，遷都，陛下却責備幾個女子不能抵抗，不怕文官武將難為情嗎？」結果是皇帝再不問了，只喝一聲道：「拉下去砍了罷！」</p>
<p>這故事得以流傳，倒多虧了司馬光：他把牠寫在「通鑑」裏面。周煇在「淸波雜誌」裹面特別讚美這位給皇帝碰釘子的女子，說像這樣的人物竟然沒有被寫入「烈女傳」裹，使她底姓名湮滅，眞是恨事。—這識見，我看在中國古人中要算是「絕無僅有」的了。</p>
<p>但這裹所說的皇帝，就是唐僖宗。我在「南詔野史」裹面却叉讀到這位皇帝另外一件和女子有關涉的事。</p>
<p>也就是黃巢被李克用「痛剿」的一年（中和三年），因為南詔（即雲南）強盛而又強硬，這位皇帝感到有些難以應付了，便把宗室底一位公主送給甫詔王隆舜。這算盤沒有打錯，南詔眞的便派了最重要的大臣和唐朝講交情來了，於是來了三個，便給他毒死三個。只可惜不久李克用又造反了，這雄圖終於沒有發展得下去　我想，那位公主大概算是報了「皇家底恩典」了罷。</p>
<p>中國一向的著作家總不願意說別個人底壤處，術語日「存忠厚之道」。但這「忠厚」往往會變成虛偽。</p>
<p>吳德旋底「初月樓聞見錄」是一部記載明淸以來人物的書，在掌故上貢獻極大，但若是從頭地讀一遍時，却會呌人發生一個疑問。那疑問是：怎麼他所「聞所「見」的人物都是這樣有才能又有道德的呢？因為事實上眞不見得到處都是「好人」。所以據我看來，吳德旋底這部著作，至少有一部分是不眞實的。</p>
<p>而且要為一個人隱諱，勢必用自己心目中的道德標準為標準，那往往會恰恰隱諱了一個人底長處。像「初月樓聞見錄」裹面記載徐巨源的一條，就犯了這樣的毛病。</p>
<p>照那裹面記載的徐巨源，只是能文章，隱居山中，誓不降淸，被強盜用火燒死，便算是一切。但徐巨源却另外有一段動人的事蹟的：他曾經參加了叛亂的農民隊伍，當時他本身便被人稱之為「強盜」。據我想來，他既能誓不降淸，他的做「強盜」，必定多少和「反淸」有些關係。現在我們知道他底事蹟很少，以吳德旋的時代和「聞見」，應該是知道的，但是他却為了隱諱而使他底事蹟湮滅了。</p>
<h3>牽牛房（註）</h3>
<p>— 唐韋</p>
<p>——劫灰拾記——</p>
<p>霽虹橋下，經過一段燈光寥落的街道。</p>
<p>不夠體面的大門，門上釘着幾塊不夠體面的搪磁招牌；從外邊看上去，這不像一個機關，同時也不像一所私人的住宅。</p>
<p>「就是這兒！」</p>
<p>陪我來的老冲，把大門推開着，旋色的燈光，打裹邊透出來，在來客的心窩裹，添上一股神秘的誘惑。</p>
<p>一間富麗—然而並不寬敞的客廳，早有幾個形式不同的客人，坐在那裹。</p>
<p>「你什麼時候回來的？」</p>
<p>羣是我惟一的熟人，他迎上來抓住我一隻右手。</p>
<p>「今天早晨。」</p>
<p>陌生的朋友，木鷄似的望着我們。</p>
<p>半天。</p>
<p>「是老唐吧？」主人謙虛的問老沖：</p>
<p>他是一個十足的，哈爾濱式樣的紳士，長領尖的襯衣，飄着一條寬頭的領帶；一雙金魚眼睛，在菱形的鏡架中閃動水汪汪的光絲。</p>
<p>「啊，給大家介紹介紹！老唐，……我們的東家兼牽牛房主人融秋；大詩人喬夫，老王，理論家石語，傻哥哥老孟，融秋太太，羣不用我介紹；」老沖把大拇指頭頂在自己胸脯上說：「老母鷄藝術家老沖被！紹的人，都歉意的，頑皮的笑着。</p>
<p>幾分鐘後，大家就互相親暱了，無限際，無輪决的談着閒話。</p>
<p>老沖死纏着後來的一位女教呂不放，他口口聲聲的喊「乾妹妹」，聽起來，呌人心裹很不舒服。</p>
<p>融秋老是不誠意的，却也不失紳士風度的笑着。———這天晚上他殷勤的招待了我。</p>
<p>這裏遇到的朋友，每個人都給了我一個深刻的印象；我不喜歡他們在嚴肅的環境裹胡爾；但是我愛重他們在冷酷氣氛中的熱情。</p>
<p>辭出。</p>
<p>看見墻壁周圍黨是新僵死的秧蔓，深信這是「牽牛房」命名的理由。</p>
<p>註：牽牛房是「九一八」</p>
<p>前後東北比較有聲譽的文藝集團，五年前滅跡了，當時常相聚會的諸友除奔走於南方的數人外，現在已經很少有人生存；它的名字悄吟在「商市街」中提起過一决，這算是第二回了。</p>
<h3>「意大利的脈搏」讀後</h3>
<p>— 貝拉圖</p>
<p>讀完了這意大利反法西斯蒂作家西籠（I．Silone）的「意大利的脈搏」（原名「豐塔馬辣）後，我的心兒在砰砰地跳躍着；這並不是因為見到法西斯蒂統治的殘酷而使我害怕，我是為着那些受到法西斯蒂迫害的意大利的貧農們而一萬萬分的憤怒着。我的心兒讓西龍的作品激怒得狂躍起來了！</p>
<p>我們讀到各國的文學作品，但是現在却讀不到意大利的和德國的，文化在那裹是沒有存在的餘地的！所謂「殖民地文學」「軍事文學」以及一些歌頌「黨老爺」的「頌歌文學」，只是一種法西斯蒂點綴品罷了！文學的眞正價值在那些「作品」裏是找不到一絲一毫的！</p>
<p>因此，在今日，我們讀到西龍先生的「意大利脈搏」，不能不說是一種意外的甜菓了，而這甜果，帶來的倒不是鮮甜的味道，確實一種苦澀的酸味，是真正意大利人民大眾的血，和眼淚以及他們的健壯的呼聲交織而成的！</p>
<p>法西斯帝究竟是一種什麽東西呢？我們或者在某一些理論書中巳經我到解答了，而是在活生生的藝術形象中，我們尚未有過如西龍先生的「意大利的脈搏」那樣地具體告訴我們呢。在這一本書裡，告訴我們，法西斯蒂想盡千計萬策向豐搭馬辣村的貧農們剝削，一到貧農們不能生活了，就開來大批的黑衫黨軍們，把他們打了個落花流水——我道話是只能抽象地這樣說的。你要問為什麼到這時候方開來黑衫黨軍把貧農們打個落花流水呢？因為第一：這些貧農們已經再也「挨不出血」（上海流氓的術語，即沒有分文錢的意思。）來了；第二，既經「挨不出血」，而那些人總得要「活」下去，可是不幸的是他們連吸一點自己的「血」賴以「活命」也不能，為了嚴防他們搗亂，還是殺掉為上上大策！</p>
<p>法西斯蒂就是這麼個東西</p>
<p>這本書的形式是新穎的，由三個貧農口述而成，但是西籠先生藝術手腕的高強，却並不因「口述」而使我們感到枯寂，相反，他一步一步地，抓緊我們的胸脯，使我們呼吸不出，而迫我們強看下去。這之間，在我們的胸脯感到緊迫時，西龍先生却用一點幽默的筆調給你一個暢笑，可是這暢笑並不把你緊迫的胸脯完全鬆弛下來，相反的，在你暢笑之後，你就更加感到一陣的緊迫，這也就是說；貧農更被剝削，法西斯蒂的殘酷史加顯示了出來！這樣的寫法，實在是值得我們注意的。</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 洪匡成</p>
<p>在枯燥中生活，沒有絲毫的調劑，更不能和「新」的元素融和。在這裏，如囹圄中的囚人，可怕的單調纏繞他，剝削他「生」的樂趣，湮沒他的希望，使他什麼都不能尋求，即使「妄想」，也不能給他享受。</p>
<p>當人們不滿於生活時，就憧憬他們的未來，羨慕其他不同的生活，他們很想學習，他們要改良生活。</p>
<p>有人說；生活要和「新」接近，才能爆出點點星火，燃起人們生命之火，向著光明的進途。最忌的是重尋古舊的夢，走向人們已踐踏而擯棄的道路，那能使人腐朽。除非是老人，已近暮年的老人，他們的白髮是陳舊的，他們的心是寂寞的，他們不喜歡變動，他們愛在廖落中，淡泊中行。</p>
<p>終日吞嚼乾硬的麵包，不喝一口白水，一杯牛乳，不久便要病倒；生活也是同樣的，沒有什麼浸潤，便產生了超人與厭世者。</p>
<p>生活更不是保守的，永遠在變動着，牠必需吸收新的元素，允其是年靑的人，不能束縛在舊的範圍裹。</p>
<p>在這複雜的人之羣中，要獲得眞理，必需要體驗各種生活，各種不同的生活，動的，變化的，有此我們才能認識道個世界，這個人類。</p>
<p>跟著生活的變化去生活吧，莫要創造理想之國，一味於崇高，而不能認識社會人羣。</p>
<p>我們要改進生活，不要做生活的奴隸。</p>

<h3>拂曉</h3>
<p>— 鄧薩南原著　王墳譯</p>
<p>誰都說不出那一個時候在戰壕中比較地緊張。誰都不能夠把任何一個時候截取出來，以近乎無聊的口吻，名之曰「戰壕中特有的時候」。戰壕中的生活，永遠是那樣的。比較起來，最緊張的時候，大概是破曉前半小時，那是最宜襲擊，而人們也防守得最為周密的時候。依照舊時的作戰觀念，那是一個最危險的時候，那是防守者最虛弱，而最怕人家去襲擊的時候。因為黑縉於攻方有利，正如夜間於獅子有利一樣；及至破曉，他們便可以守住所得的地方了。因此，在每一决戰爭，每一條戰壕中，每至這一個凶險的時候，哨兵們最是刻意防守，而配備了比整個夜間更多的守兵。當第一羽雲雀從草地上飛翔起來，他們便在黑暗中守備着。在任何一處地方，任何一回戰爭中，你可以確信在這個時候，人們一定會擁塞到戰壕的胸壁：在城市裏的人們睡得最酣甜的時候，他們却在那邊警戒着呢。</p>
<p>及至曙光微露，天空中顯出魚肚白色，漸漸地擴展開來，而人影也突然可以看得淸晰時，襲擊的時候便成過去，於是新兵心裹，也許會有一縷微細的愉快之感了；其實，這一個時候，還不是與平時一樣地過去的嗎？也不過是戰壕生活中一個平凡的片段而巳。</p>
<p>曙光羞澀似地呈露，微風不經意地吹拂，在人們仍然守望着黑暗的時候，曉色却已在東邊微透出來了。黑暗在什麼時候消褪的呢？曙光叉在什麼時候變得金黃？一切都在霎時間發生，在你看不見的一霎時間發生的。大砲不再發光：天空璀燦明朗；淸晨正如德奧國王苛暴治世的時候即將到來的勝利。破曉以後，士兵們把槍刺拔了下來，走下了戰壕中的崗位，用鋼條整理步槍。這個工作，不是全體士兵同時做的，而是分別地舉行；不僅在淸晨如此，便是在任何一個時候也不能呌全體士兵同時擦槍。</p>
<p>他們把夜間濺落在步槍上的泥土或雨水擦去了；把槍瞠卸開，瞧那彈簧是吾可用；把後膛塞拆去，上了一點油，然後把各種已經整好的機件，重又配合起來：於是一夜又過去了；接着是更接近勝利的一天。</p>

<h3>南鐵生藝術之全貌（上）</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>南鐵生在黃金作十日短期演出，輿論頗不一致其實鐵生由票友下海，以票友目光論鐵生，確屬難能可貴。若以內行藝術作苛求，不無可議之處。蓋玩票時期，有一技之長，即可成名，而伶人非諸般皆能，不得稱精。今南伶既經下海，持論亦宜稍加嚴格，筆者曾聽其「全部玉堂春「及「四郎探母」二劇，覺其藝術雖精，殊未續平均化，爰就觀感所及，分別述之：</p>
<p>扮相與台风台屬既非完全屬於氣度，亦非純粹指扮相而言，乃綜合氣度扮相之一種抽象名詞，南伶本來面目，本極淸秀，上裝後更艷麗無比。瞼部輪廓因鼻準兩旁調粉小勻，片子黏貼地位太後，未免美中不足，身材修短合度，瘦肥相稱，外表華貴似流而不動，似婉而不柔，嬌艷不足，淸秀有餘，神采奕奕不外射，深合乎端莊渾厚之致，故其演悲劇遠勝喜劇，靑衣戲實較花衫戲更為適宜。</p>
<p>唱工與唸白鐵生之嗓，剛柔互濟，寬亮甜潤，兼而有之，拔高不裂，走低能澗，且富水音，確有幾分畹華意味。鐵生雖會從瑤卿遊，而其唱腔則以私淑畹華為多，峭拔處尾音近靡，似為花杉路數，實非靑衣正音。蓋唱腔之花巧者，其味率皆纖薄，（伶之工候深者，其味在音可補此憾）且不合莊重貞烈雅靜大方之旨。音之媚與蕩者，亦失此義，皆不合靑衣之條件，鐵生致力於斯，或迎合普通觀衆口味之故。惟其低音婉轉自如，與黃桂秋有異曲同工之妙，每能聽到一二好腔，其韻味偏於淸麗一路，衷氣甚佳，頗利行腔。「會審」之流水，一氣呵成，接筍得法，非常動聽。惟咬字欠斟酌，板槽亦不工穩，此係登台經驗缺乏所致，不足為病也。總其唱工上之佳點，即嗓好腔純，不求花俏，處處從平淡中省力，麗而有骨，且高音純出自然，非黃桂秋用喉底疾音反高，程硯秋用窄喉逼高者可比，深屬難得。白口發音含糊，字音更不正確，有佶屈聱牙之病，抑揚之法，賓主之分，均須再加研究。依鐵生戲路，韻白宜取法硯秋，淸麗準確，深合靑衣作風。畹華白口，柔若無骨，溫和動聽，施於靑衣，似嫌太膩。蓋靑衣白口必須抑揚有序，字斟句酌，吐字一若有千鈞之重，而仍不失其自然之態者，方能恰合身份，固不應如各花衫念白之流俐圓婉過甚，而失莊重大方之旨也。</p>
<p>伊於水發之夜，即遷入西人旅社，該地較高，當遷入時無水，翌晨水亦有二三尺，乃決意離津，時太古順天輪適泊埠，乃設法來滬。輪上擁擠不看，食物頗成問題，故每人之食料，祗有平時一半，中途且遇颶風，誠所謂禍不單行也。津地水發後糧食大半被水沖去，致發生極大問題，故雖普通國產餅乾一磅須洋數元。糖醬一瓶竟索洋五元。於平民之生計影響極巨，此輩急待救濟之災民，各大善士從速接濟，則恩同再造，記者詢演劇助災如何？伊表示如有人發起，當樂然助其成也。（移酬助津災）</p>

<p>“Dodge　City”</p>
<p>南北戰爭以後，在建設新的道奇城的時候，道奇城中有惡霸傑飛蘇里脫，仗着手下黨羽衆多，無惡不作。居民懾於淫威，敢怒而不敢言，但是望治之心極切。會有威德海頓，率領移民至道奇城，在目睹傑飛蘇里脫的惡行後，毅然出任警長之職，決肅淸城中敗類。有報館主筆佐意克里明士，平日痛恨蘇里脫之行為，暗中搜集其犯法之證據，而為蘇里脫暗殺，威德海頓在捕獲暗殺犯後，解犯至塞至威吉塔城審問，車中與蘇里脫黨羽相遇，遂一鼓殲滅之。</p>
<p>這故事吿訴我們：仗着淫暴的威力來想統治一切是終於要遭到傾覆的一天。如道奇城居民的俯首於傑飛蘇里脫之前，不過是懼怕他的淫威而已；但是憤怒之火是隨着淫威與日俱增。威德海頓不過是導火綫，在他背後的羣衆才是滅亡蘇里脫及其黨羽的力量！</p>
<p>全片的演出，在馬歇爾寇滋的卓越手腕之下，全片的進展，始終緊張熱鬧，允其是幾個大塲面的處理，動人之至。</p>
<p>如李歐文醉後放槍，牛羣為槍所驚，東奔西竄，歐文不及避讓，踐踏而死；及在酒店中大打出手一塲，都很緊張生動。最後火車中的高潮，更見出色，他是這樣寫的：威德海頓押解兇犯上火車；火車開出；，蘇里脫的黨羽在車後跳上；車頂上爬行；愛貝瞥見人影越過車廂；黨徒握槍監視開車者；其餘黨徒在車廂中向威德海頓的一節車走去；愛貝的疑懼；黨徒步入威德海頓車中；威德海頓及勒斯德哈特機警避之；雙方轟擊；愛貝聞槍聲起立；車中不慎起火；兇犯在火燄中掙扎；愛貝入，被黨徒握，逼令戚德海頓繳械；威德海頓在火燄中為兇犯解除手銬；黨徒出車廂，鎖鬥；草原上黨徒飛馬救人；戚德海頓撞破車廂後面的門；黨徒從車廂躍上馬背；威德海頓和勒斯德哈特向奔馬開槍；黨徒中彈墜馬……這一塲戲，不但始終陷於緊張的空氣中，而且各方面的描寫都心細如髮。</p>
<p>此外，如勾劃勒斯德哈特的性格，使本片增加不少風趣塲面。減少威德海頓和愛貝的戀愛，也使全片更見紧湊。</p>
<p>埃洛爾茀林的威德海頓，仍保持着英俊剛健之質。奧麗薇哈佛蘭的愛貝，為劇情所限，未展所長。安秀麗丹祇唱了幾隻歌</p>

<h3>English and French Governments Reply to Hitler, Reaffirming Their Determination to Continue the War, Fulfilling Their Obligations to Poland Until Justice is Upheld. Chamberlain Criticizes Soviet Actions as Utterly Unjustified.</h3>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain, in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the progress of the war, stated that the events of the past week were of profound and significant nature, and their impact on the future of the war and other countries is currently difficult to estimate. Throughout this week, the German forces continued to pressure the Polish army, which continued to resist with all its might. Currently, many parts of Poland are still continuing to fight, and Poland still holds some safe areas as a basis for resistance. For example, Warsaw still refuses to surrender to German forces. An event occurred on September 17 that had a decisive impact on the Eastern Front. On that evening, the Soviet army crossed the border along the entire line and invaded Poland. I cannot describe this action by the Soviet government as unexpected, as the Soviet newspapers and radio had previously announced statements regarding the status of Belarusians and Ukrainians within Poland, indicating that the Soviet government had long prepared for intervention. Recalling the note from the Soviet Union to British Ambassador Sir Seeds, it stated that it would adopt a neutral policy regarding the relations between the UK and the USSR. Therefore, the British government, under these circumstances, issued a declaration on September 18 regarding the Soviet invasion of Poland, stating that no matter how the Soviet actions are justified, they have no legitimate reason. Although the details of this incident are not yet fully clear, no matter what the situation, it is not enough to shake the British government's determination to fulfill its obligations to Poland and to fight with all its strength to fulfill these obligations. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London – When the House of Commons convened at 4 PM today, Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech stating, "The British and French governments have decided to continue the war. The international situation has not changed due to German leader Hitler's speech yesterday. As for the events of the past week, they are of a very significant nature, and their impact on the future of the war and the attitudes of other countries is difficult to estimate at this time. Although the German army continues to pressure the Polish army, the Polish army is sparing no effort in resisting the powerful enemy. To this day, there are still many isolated Polish troops in Poland holding strategic positions to resist the enemy. The unyielding nature of the Warsaw garrison is one example. On the 17th of this month, the Soviet army suddenly advanced along the entire Eastern border of Poland. Although this cannot be said to be entirely unexpected, it is undeniable that it has significantly affected the Eastern Front." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons at 4 PM that regarding the Soviet army's entry into Poland, the British government issued a statement on the 18th of this month, declaring that Britain is determined to fulfill its obligations to Poland and continue the war, and will not be influenced by the outside world. This stance must now be reiterated. As for German leader Hitler's speech yesterday, it was full of exaggerated and threatening words. This manner of speaking is not something we adopt. It is precisely for this reason that the German authorities find it difficult to understand us. Although I am commenting on his speech, I still maintain our national habit of speaking calmly and peacefully. I wonder if the German authorities can also see this quality. As for the content of Hitler's speech, there is nothing new. The international situation has not changed because of it. Prime Minister Chamberlain then answered an inquiry from Liberal Party MP Mandel, stating, "The British government's goal in deciding to wage war remains to establish a lasting international system to prevent all wars and resolve international disputes through peaceful means." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – Official sources recently announced that the cabinet solemnly declared during a state council meeting this morning that "France has decided to continue the war until justice triumphs over might." The events that have occurred recently are absolutely insufficient to change the attitude of Britain and France. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – The French government has issued a reply to Hitler's speech in Danzig yesterday, stating that the purpose of Hitler's speech was nothing more than to show the German people that his war was a last resort. At the same time, Hitler's speech was also intended to sow discord between Britain and France. However, Britain's guarantee to Poland was entirely the result of Germany's broken promises in annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, Hitler's intention was to destroy Poland and not just to acquire Danzig. The Nazi Party's various propaganda regarding the treatment of the German minority in Poland is exactly the same as what was used during the Sudetenland crisis last year. This propaganda is enough to prove that Hitler has no sincerity for peace. In short, Britain and France will never allow Hitler to achieve a victory that would enslave the world and destroy human freedom. (Associated Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Invading Polish Territory, Soviet Troops Continue to Advance, Occupying Vilnius in the North, Reaching Lviv in the South.</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Red Army General Staff recently released a battle report stating that our troops continued to advance along all fronts in Poland yesterday. By the evening, they had occupied the following locations: (1) The Northern Route, also known as the Russian district, after fighting fiercely for two hours, had occupied Vilnius, Vileyka, Berdawichai (50 kilometers east of Bialystok), Prudnik Gablin (northeast of Brest-Litovsk), and other cities. (2) The Southern Route, also known as the Ukrainian district, had occupied Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Sokal (on the Bug River), Brody, Busk, Rogatyn, and Duliina. In addition, our cavalry and tank units had begun to reach the northeast and south of Lviv. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London – German official radio stated that since Soviet troops occupied Kuty, the entire Polish border bordering Romania is now under Soviet control. (Reuters, 20th) The Soviet army in Kaunas reached the Lithuanian border in Vyevis yesterday and exchanged salutes with the Lithuanian border guards. It is reported that Polish troops burned all the bridges in Vilnius and moved military supplies elsewhere before the Soviet troops arrived. After the Soviet occupation of Vilnius, civilian militia patrol teams were deployed on the streets and a civilian conference was established. Its first task was to organize a civilian army. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Kaunas – It was recently learned that a squadron of Soviet giant tanks charged into Vilnius on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Moscow – The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army announced the operational communique for the 19th as follows: "On September 19, Red Army units continued to pursue Polish troops, and by the evening of that day, they had occupied the following locations: On the northern front of Western Belarus, after two hours of fighting, the town of Vilnius was occupied, as well as Vyalikaya Byerastavitsa (50 kilometers east of Bialystok), Pruzhany, Kobrin (40 kilometers northeast of Brest-Litovsk), and other towns. On the southern front of Western Ukraine, the towns of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Sokal (on the banks of the Bug River), Brody, Busk, Rogatyn, and Dulyny were occupied. Cavalry and tank units have advanced to the northeastern and southern suburbs of Lviv." (TASS, 20th)</p>
<p>, and forced the majority of the Polish infantry to retreat. Moreover, before the arrival of the Soviet army, the sound of gunfire continued throughout the night, demonstrating the fierce resistance of the Polish garrison. It is heard that 50,000 Polish soldiers had crossed the Lithuanian border at around 8 AM yesterday. In addition, another 30,000 Polish soldiers entered Lithuania in organized formations, where they were disarmed and detained by the local authorities. They were all weathered and exhausted. It is estimated that the total number of Polish soldiers seeking refuge in Lithuania will reach 100,000. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Meeting Approves Various Military Measures, Confident of Achieving Ultimate Victory.</h3>
<p>Paris – The State Council convened this morning, presided over by President Lebrun. It approved the government's proposed "various military, economic, and financial measures, that is, various measures to continue the war until ultimate victory," and reiterated that Britain and France maintain a united relationship that is "increasingly close." In addition, all cabinet members unanimously expressed their respect for the heroic resistance of Poland, and all believe that Britain, France, and Poland will achieve a common victory. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – Prime Minister Daladier met yesterday with senior military and government officials. It is reported that the meeting decided that although the Soviet Union has invaded Poland, France still intends to maintain normal relations with the Soviet Union. Before the Soviet Union further clarifies its attitude, the meeting decided to submit the resolution to the Cabinet meeting for approval today. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Information Ministry Issues an Article Denouncing Hitler's Speech as Nonsense and Falsehoods.</h3>
<p>London – The British Information Ministry recently issued an article in the form of a public statement refuting Hitler's remarks, calling his words full of nonsense and falsehoods, and stating that it is surprising that someone in a responsible position like Hitler would speak so recklessly and carelessly. The statement compared Hitler's previous statements with what he broadcasted yesterday, saying that Hitler's words yesterday referred to the deceased Polish military leader Piłsudski as a forceful and practical figure who had rejected the Treaty of Versailles with Hitler, but then said that the minority of Germans suffered barbarous treatment and the world remained silent. It should be known that the world remained silent because from the death of Piłsudski until this spring, Hitler had always acknowledged that his relations with Poland were very good. On May 21, 1935, Hitler spoke in Parliament, saying that he recognized Poland as a great patriotic nation with understanding and friendly friendship. On February 20, 1938, Hitler again stated in Parliament that German-Polish relations not only had treaty characteristics, but also had more friendly approaches in the past year, and the League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig was also of high character, and claimed that Danzig, which was most likely to endanger European peace, had lost its dangerous meaning. On September 26, 1938, Hitler also mentioned Poland, saying that in the past year, an agreement had been reached with Poland to eliminate the danger of conflict for ten years. Poland has recently witnessed the shameful act of the German government breaking its solemn guarantee given in Munich, and Hitler's assertion that Germany no longer has territorial ambitions in Europe has also been repeatedly and thoroughly broken. Now that Hitler is telling us about the Soviet Union, he has probably forgotten the words of the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop when he advised Britain to oppose the Soviet Union, telling us how dangerous the Soviet Union is. On January 30, 1937, did Hitler not denounce Bolshevism as a germ in Parliament, asking German workers not to have contact with this international parasite? On September 14 of that year, did Hitler not declare in Nuremberg that he did not want to isolate himself by not cooperating with the Soviet Union, but wanted to protect himself? Even on February 2, 1938, Hitler made a firm statement in Parliament that "there is only one country in the world with which Germany does not want to have close relations, and that is the Soviet Union." Britain does not have the problem of fighting against German women and children. The German government has announced that Germany has sufficient food reserves, and as for the restrictions on the import of military raw materials, it is not a plan that the German government can legitimately accuse. Hitler's description of the situation at the beginning of the war is also contrary to the facts. Germany decided to wage war and hoped that Britain would not fulfill its obligations to Poland. Britain only sent a note with sorrowful beauty to the German government when it did not receive a German reply until two days after the German army invaded Poland. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>British and French Newspapers Comment: The Depressed Psychology of the German Side, Hitler's Emotions Revealed in His Words.</h3>
<p>London – Although Hitler's speech contained dangerous threats, saying that there was a "secret weapon" that could win, the newspapers still considered it to be old news, and several newspapers believed that this speech was not worth answering. The Times stated that Hitler's speech did not need to be answered, but only to be answered in practice. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – French newspapers criticized Hitler's speech, saying that Hitler could not hide his fear. Le Journal de Paris said, "If the person who provoked the war and hoped for a short and successful end to the war is not disturbed by the fear of a long-term war of attrition, then what is the meaning of this speech? This person can no longer hide his fear." L'Ordre quoted an article by Pertinax as saying that Hitler may soon show his diplomatic means to the countries of Central Europe in order to achieve his goals. Le Petit Parisien said that Hitler's speech revealed a melancholic mood. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Rome Watches Quietly, Believes the Hope of Peace is Slim.</h3>
<p>The Fascist side in Rome did not criticize Hitler's broadcast speech. The expectations of the Italian people for a peaceful movement and an early opportunity for war have now been extinguished. The general public is eager to stay out of the conflict, but now they are watching with attention. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome – The newspapers here have headlined Hitler's speech in Danzig with extra-large headlines. The comments mostly focus on the point that Poland no longer exists. Il Messaggero said, "We dare not predict the future of the war, but we only know that the current situation requires all parties to seek an appropriate solution to the problem with a spirit of mutual concession and goodwill." Il Popolo di Roma said, "From the current situation, disarmament and peace are still possible, but if the war is prolonged, we will only suffer years of sacrifice and pain, and it is still difficult to hope for a just peace."

<p>Washington – Washington believes that Hitler's speech in Danzig is the cornerstone of the expected Hitler peace offensive, which will be implemented by Italy or even the Soviet Union with diplomatic action. The general public's interest in Hitler's decision to speak is not as great as in previous speeches. When Hitler spoke before, there were many people gathered at the National Press Club here to listen. This time, there were very few listeners. Well-informed sources believe that Hitler's speech has revealed his anxiety to avoid a long-term war, but it is expected that Britain and France will reject the peace offensive, because Hitler's proposal will put Poland at risk, and Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia will also feel threatened, and in the near future, Germany will directly attack British and French territories. Those in charge do not believe in the possibility of an alliance between communism and Nazism. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Divide Poland, Negotiate Border Demarcation, Inevitable Friction Due to Conflicting Interests, Germany Sends Personnel to the Soviet Union to Discuss Military Cooperation.</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital – Well-informed sources here recently announced that although representatives from both sides have conducted negotiations regarding the demarcation line between Germany and the Soviet Union in Poland, it has not yet been fully determined. Future friction is also possible. According to news from Berlin, German political figures are very anxious about this, and the expansion of Soviet power in Poland is considered to be of a significant nature, exceeding expectations, and inconsistent with the principles of the German-Soviet agreement. It is observed that the Soviet Union's strategy is to delay the time, making it difficult for the final agreement to be reached quickly, while at the same time occupying certain places that Germany is coveting first, thereby creating a fait accompli. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Cernauti, Romania – The general public here believes that Germany and the Soviet Union have not established any agreement on dividing Poland's "occupied areas," and the traffic line between Germany and Romania will be controlled by the Soviet Red Army. Before the outbreak of the war, Germany had purchased a large amount of wheat and oil from Romania, and its business relationship with Romania was based purely on barter agreements. If Germany is unable to import its industrial products into Romania, then Romania will also refuse to supply Germany's needs. Now that the Soviet army has arrived at the Romanian border, Romania is no longer directly threatened by Germany, and will naturally deal with it with the most resolute attitude. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Several German army and air force officers arrived here last night on a special plane from the German headquarters. It is claimed that they are on a mission to discuss with the Soviet authorities various issues of cooperation between the German and Soviet armies in Poland. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Romanian Contacts, Revising Borders, Hungary Acknowledges Contact with Soviet Army, Soviet-Yugoslav Relations to be Restored in the Short Term.</h3>
<p>Rome – According to a reporter from the Italian official news agency Stefani, Soviet and Romanian officers met yesterday on the Polish border and immediately agreed to organize a military committee to restore border traffic. The reporter also said that direct negotiations will be held between Moscow and Bucharest to redefine the new border between the Soviet Union and Romania. Since 1927, the Soviet Union has not sent a diplomatic representative to the capital of Yugoslavia. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>Cernauti, Romania – A colonel of the Romanian army led a delegation to Chertkov, Poland (in eastern Poland) this afternoon to contact the commander of the Soviet army regarding border affairs, but did not discuss any political issues. So far, the city of Kuty, Poland, has not been occupied by the Soviet army, and the Soviet commander is allowing Polish refugees to flee to Romania in the occupied areas. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome – A special reporter from the Italian "Stefani News Agency" sent a report from the Romanian border today, saying that the Soviet army's actions in the Polish territory bordering Romania are extremely cautious, and they are trying to avoid violating Romania's neutrality. The commander of the Russian army declared that they had received instructions to strictly observe the Romanian border, so yesterday, two Russian tanks mistakenly entered Romania in Chertkov, and the Soviet officers immediately apologized to the Romanian authorities. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>Budapest – Rumors that the Soviet army has approached the Hungarian border are circulating. Well-informed sources here say that it is possible that the Soviet army outposts have reached the border, but there has been no formal contact with the Hungarian border guards. (Havas, 28th) Belgrade – The Yugoslav envoy Georgievich returned to the country from Moscow yesterday. It is expected that the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia will resume diplomatic relations in the near future, and will send ambassadors to each other in a short period of time. Since 1927, the Soviet Union has not sent diplomatic representatives to the capital of Yugoslavia. (Haitong, 20th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japanese Sudden Onset of Anti-American Propaganda</h3>
<p>A week ago, U.S. President Roosevelt, in his statement on foreign policy, regarding the Far East, expressed his opposition to the use of force or other means to unilaterally alter the status quo in the Far East. The significance of this lies in firmly rejecting Japan's so-called "New Order in the Far East." Following this statement, there was no apparent reaction from the Japanese government. However, news arrived from Tokyo yesterday stating that several important Japanese newspapers had, on the same day, published articles warning the United States, accusing it of wanting to succeed Britain as the "guard dog" of the Far East, demanding a change in its attitude towards Japan, or else Japan would not hesitate to resort to military force. The words were filled with resentment and threats. Before the Japanese government officially expresses its attitude towards the United States, we cannot merely rely on Japanese public opinion to speculate on Japan's attitude towards the United States. However, under the current strict control of the government over Japanese public opinion, discussions related to foreign relations must be especially cautious. Now, to launch such a strong attack on the United States, which has always been regarded with respect, cannot but be seen as based on some underlying motive.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has treated the United States differently in the process of creating its so-called "New Order in the Far East." Whenever American interests in China have been damaged by the Japanese military, it has either immediately compensated or apologized, never allowing the incident to escalate. Recently, although the United States has abolished the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and stopped buying gold, which will have a significant material impact and some spiritual stimulation on Japan, Japan is still hoping to renegotiate the commercial treaty. Before this hope is completely dashed, it seems unnecessary to resort to such threatening tactics. Moreover, the newly appointed Japanese Prime Minister Abe has made harmonious foreign relations his current foreign policy. How could an anti-American phenomenon arise so soon after taking office?</p>
<p>In fact, the emergence of this phenomenon is still due to Japan's active development of its ambitions in the Far East. However, its formation is due to two erroneous concepts: First, Japan mistakenly believes that the European war is beneficial to Japan. It believes that since Britain and France have declared war on Germany, they are no longer able to take care of their interests in the Far East. Moreover, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact can avoid military threats from the side in its aggression against China. Originally, the Soviet-Japanese truce may not have much effect on Japan's military operations in China, a point that the Japanese government has already clearly acknowledged. However, it believes that the participation of Britain and France in the European war is the only opportunity to create its so-called "New Order in the Far East." Among the countries with beneficial relationships in the Far East, Britain, France, and the United States are the most important. Now that Britain and France are no longer able to take care of their interests in the Far East, only the United States remains. Therefore, Japan believes that as long as it coerces the United States into submission, its so-called "New Order in the Far East" can be completed successfully.</p>
<p>Second, Japan mistakenly believes that the United States' Far East policy can be abandoned. Japan believes that the United States only focuses on interests. The small favors Japan has given to American expatriates in China in the past, it is confident that it can prevent the United States from fulfilling its treaty obligations in the Far East. It believes that the United States has no political interest in hindering the construction of the so-called "New Order in the Far East." Moreover, since the outbreak of the European war, whether the U.S. Neutrality Act needs to be revised has become a major dispute between political parties in the United States. American isolationists have even put forward the slogan "European borders have nothing to do with us." Japan also wants to take this opportunity to stimulate the emotions of the isolationists with a U.S.-Japan war, asking them to put forward the slogan "What does the Far East situation have to do with us," forcing the United States to abandon its interference in the Far East.</p>
<p>However, things may not always go as planned. The impact of the European war on the interests of the Far East, whether for Japan or China, is still uncertain given the rapidly changing international relations at the moment! Moreover, the Soviet-Japanese truce may not enable Japan to concentrate on its aggression against China. China's war effort relies entirely on its own strength, and its military and political progress over the years has enabled it to resist any Japanese attempts. As for the United States' Far East policy, it has always adhered to the two major principles of maintaining the Open Door policy and preserving China's territorial and administrative integrity. There are complex reasons why the United States has not actively fulfilled its obligations under these two major principles in the past, but it is definitely not abandonment. The purpose of the United States in adhering to these two principles is also to protect its interests in the Far East. The borders of Europe, one might say, have nothing to do with the United States, but the rights in the Far East must be protected. This is not only a matter of interests, but also concerns the security of the United States itself. In the Far East war of the past two years, the damage to American interests has exceeded six hundred cases. How can the United States continue to tolerate this? The recent strengthening of its Pacific defenses and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty are just preliminary retaliatory measures. However, Japan does not realize the situation and instead attempts to force the United States to abandon its interests in the Far East with a threatening tone. Can such wishful thinking be realized?</p>
<p>The true meaning of modern warfare has been tested in Japan: the consumption of military and financial resources over the past two years has exhausted Japan to what extent! Does it still have the ability to launch a new war? If so, why did it sign the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact? In terms of Japan's need for armaments alone, since the outbreak of the European war, the only source has been the United States. If the United States were to stop supplying, not to mention that the war against the United States could not be realized, even its actions in the Far East would probably be difficult to sustain. The anti-American propaganda in the Japanese press is just a futile attempt because they do not understand the firmness of the United States' attitude.</p>
<h3>German Troops Massing on Belgian and Dutch Borders; British and French Commanders Confer on Cooperation; Little Change in General Situation on Western Front</h3>
<p>Paris – Reliable sources report that German troops transferred from Poland to the Western Front have massed on the Belgian and Dutch borders. (Hanchun, Associated Press Special Correspondent, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – French General Commander Marshal Gamoulin and British Expeditionary Force Commander Major General Goddard met in northern France yesterday to discuss a plan for evenly deploying British and French troops to the front to resist the Germans. British troops in France last night were on standby to move to the front to attack the Germans. British troops will be stationed along the French Maginot Line II along the Belgian border to stop the German advance along that route. The meeting of the British and French military leaders is consistent with reports that German troops have massed in the Rhineland area. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – The French Official Gazette announced that German troops launched local attacks on the area east of Brisca-Sas in the southern part of the Sarre basin, but were repelled by French troops. "Enemy aircraft were active in the area." Under the cover of heavy artillery, German troops launched a night attack. German troops first tried using a new type of 16.5-inch naval gun mounted on flat vehicles. German troops actively reinforced the garrison defending the city of Saarbrücken, determined to prevent French troops from invading the city. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – General Headquarters has just issued War Report No. 32, stating briefly that "enemy troops have made a local attack on the east bank of the Bris River, but have been repelled by our troops. Enemy aircraft have also been active in the same area." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – Semi-official circles reviewed the German-French border fighting and said that there had been little change in the general situation on the Western Front in the past 24 hours. According to French communiqués, the offensive launched by German troops in the area east of the Saar River was of a nature that would have been called a large-scale attack in the last war, with the intention of familiarizing German soldiers with this type of warfare, that is, attacking under constant artillery fire. However, the fierce artillery fire of the French machine gun and artillery teams ultimately caused the German offensive to wither, and there was no change in the positions. A recent communiqué from the French command stated that the enemy had made a local attack in the area east of the Bres River and was repelled. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – The famous reporter Maurice recently commented on the situation of the French-German war in the Petit Parisian newspaper, stating briefly: "Germany launched a counter-offensive in two places on the front line the day before yesterday, intending to retake the positions occupied by the French army. The first attack was in the area between the Saar River and the Bris River, at night on the 18th of this month. The second attack was near Métail-sur-Seille on the east bank of the Bres River, around the 19th. The two engagements lasted only two hours and were repelled by our army. Apart from this, the front line is calm and nothing happens. Our army is consolidating the positions it occupied last week." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – General Headquarters issued War Report No. 33 this morning, stating: "The entire line was calm last night, and the enemy artillery only fired on the east bank of the Bras River." French military figures commented on this, saying that the current period is a "period of strategic observation." For two days, the enemy has been very calm across the entire line, except for a local offensive on the east bank of the Bras River yesterday afternoon. The enemy on the east bank of the Bras River launched a surprise attack. Although there was some progress at first, the French army drove them back to their original positions. As for the situation in the Polish war, according to the latest news from that country, Polish troops are still continuing to resist superior German forces in several places, namely in the three cities of Warsaw, Łowicz, and Lviv. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London – There is much speculation about Germany's intentions on the Western Front. The recent movements of the German army clearly aim to drive out the French army occupying the highlands of the Saar River and the Bris River (a small river east of Saarbrücken, deep in the wooded hills) and the Nieder plateau west of the Bris River. The French army in these areas now controls the vast industrial area connecting the Siegfried Line with artillery. The question today is whether Germany, unable to wage a long-term war, will again attempt to use the "lightning war tactics" that won in Poland. Germany announced that its air force has completed its mission in Poland and is now preparing to fulfill its other responsibilities. This is a prelude to the early arrival of approximately 3,000 German Air Force planes on the Western Front. However, it will take weeks to transport the army with heavy equipment to the Western Front. In Poland, the Soviet Union seems to have effectively recovered the land ceded to Germany under the forced Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in the last Great War. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union intends to occupy all of Eastern Galicia. If so, Germany, now only threatened by Britain and France, will certainly not dare to oppose it. According to a Polish officer, speaking to a Reuters interviewer in Szegedy today, it is generally believed that the Soviet Union will try to quickly occupy Poland's oil fields to prevent them from falling into German hands. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Polish Government Rumored to Move to France; Polish Army Prepares for Long-Term Guerrilla Warfare; Germans Claim to Have Captured 105,000; Germans Admit Warsaw Cannot Be Taken in One Stroke</h3>
<p>Paris – According to sources close to the government, Polish President Mościcki and other Polish officials will arrive in France to establish a government. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Polish troops will soon begin long-term guerrilla warfare against Germany in order to prevent German heavy weapons from being transferred to the Western Front. French sources said that the Polish 13th Division is still fighting German troops near Khoteło, and other Polish troops are continuing to resist German troops in Modlin, Łódź, Warsaw, Brest-Litovsk, and Lviv. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – The news that the Polish government will move to French territory, which the Haida News Agency learned yesterday, has been confirmed today by the "Daily Telegraph". It is said that the French government has agreed, but the location has not been determined. (Haida, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris – The Paris Evening News said that the Polish government may move to France to continue working, as the Belgian government did during the last Great War. However, this statement has not been officially confirmed. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London – According to a radio broadcast from the Warsaw Defense Command, several Polish cities, such as Modlin, Kutno, and Warsaw, are still in the hands of Polish troops despite the fierce German attacks. It is said that the enemy's attack on Modlin has been repelled. In the Kutno area, Polish troops have broken through the enemy lines and joined the Warsaw Polish troops. In the Grodek area, Polish troops are advancing towards Lviv to relieve the siege of Lviv. The garrison of the Hel Peninsula is still holding its ground. In eastern Poland, there are still several strong units engaged in harassing the enemy. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin – A German military expert told a reporter from the Haida News Agency that the preparations near Warsaw have been completed. This attack cannot be completed in a few hours, because occupying a city with a million people is a special task in modern warfare and cannot be taken lightly. German senior generals now want to avoid unnecessary bloodshed among the Polish people as much as possible and have made systematic preparations. The recent convergence of German troops in southeastern Warsaw makes the fall of the city inevitable. (Haida, 20th)</p>
<h3>French Claim to Have Sunk Several Submarines; British Ship "Affolmorea" Suffers Again</h3>
<p>Paris – French officials believe that French warships have sunk four or five German submarines. Large French naval units, equipped with artillery and depth charge weapons, are cooperating with the British navy to search for submarines. Semi-official sources say that the results of the current fight against German submarines are even better than those obtained in the second half of 1918, when the German submarine war was at its most intense. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London – According to the London "Traffic Telegraph", the British merchant ship "Affolmorea", weighing 4,600 tons, was sunk by a German submarine yesterday. Only eleven people were rescued. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>London – The British ship "Baron Louvart" was attacked by a German submarine yesterday but was not hit. It has now arrived in a domestic port. According to the crew, "We saw a submarine approaching the starboard side of the ship and fired a shot, ordering us to stop, but the captain ignored it and continued to speed up. The submarine immediately sank and began firing torpedoes at the ship, fortunately without hitting it." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Danzig – Yesterday, a heavily damaged German submarine, in a floundering posture, sailed into Reykjavik Harbor, the capital of Iceland. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – According to an official report released in London, the British fishing boats "Minto" and "Aristo", each about 300 tons, were sunk by enemy submarines yesterday. The details have not been announced. (Haida, 20th)</p>
<h3>"Courageous" Number of Officers and Men Killed Totals 501</h3>
<p>London – The British Admiralty yesterday released the fourth list of rescued personnel from the aircraft carrier "Courageous". The number of people rescued has reached 759, and the number of missing is now only 501. The "Courageous" was sunk by a German submarine off the coast of Ireland on Sunday night.

<h3>United States Strengthens Far East Strength; Japan Feels Deeply Uneasy; U.S. Fighter Squadron Flies to Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo – A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to a question from a foreign newspaper reporter today, saying that some Japanese are under the impression that the United States has recently made unfriendly acts towards Japan. Japan's policy toward China has long been decided and has been announced repeatedly. The Japanese government has a firm determination and full preparation to implement this policy. Its purpose is to build lasting peace in East Asia and organize an economic group of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. Some foreigners, even if they do not suspect that Japan will expel all foreign interests in China, are clearly worried. However, this is not the case. Japan fully respects the interests of third countries in China, as long as they represent peaceful and legitimate commerce. Japan sincerely hopes that all countries, including the United States, can correctly understand its purpose and intention. The spokesman also mentioned rumors that the United States has strengthened its Asian fleet, saying that we do not know the motives for this move by the United States. However, what we desire is peace in East Asia and do not want to be involved in the whirlpool of the European war. The United States must also be eager to prevent the European war from spreading to the Pacific region. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Today, the Daily News reported that since Britain and France are occupied in Western Europe, the United States has taken on the responsibility of looking after the interests of various civilized countries in the Far East. This speculation is based on recent decisions made by the United States, namely: (1) Transferring the aircraft carrier Langley to Manila, (2) Sending 15 heavy bombers to Manila, and (3) Replacing all of the existing submarines stationed in Asian waters with new ones. In addition, there are several other things that prove this: (1) Bringing forward the date of the 1940 Pacific Fleet maneuvers by several months, to be held in January, (2) Immediately starting construction of air force bases in Alaska, Midway Island, Hawaii, and Johnston Island, (3) Widening the Panama Canal. The newspaper also said that the general impression is that the United States will eventually join the French and British side in the war, but opinions differ on the timing of the joining. Some observers believe that the United States will participate in the war within the next four weeks. Other people say that the United States will not participate until after the 1940 presidential election. Still others say that the United States will declare war on Germany only when Britain is fighting unfavorably. The newspaper also said that the United States has accelerated its preparations in all aspects since the Soviet Union and Japan signed the Nomonhan truce agreement and Soviet troops entered Poland. The emergency military measures taken by the United States include the following: (1) Accelerating the naval shipbuilding program so that the two battleships currently under construction can be completed earlier next year, (2) Re-mobilizing some of the ships in the reserve fleet to join active duty within this year, including 110 destroyers, 40 submarines, and 75 other warships, (3) Issuing an order to enlist 75,000 sailors and 7,000 marines, (4) The Navy Department announced that the fleet maneuvers originally scheduled for February and March next year in Hawaiian waters will be held earlier, (5) Establishing counter-espionage and intelligence agencies in Manila, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Honolulu – Naval authorities announced last night that a team of naval aircraft left here at 6:30 a.m. yesterday for Manila. It is believed that the team had 15 planes, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel LaHachey. Naval authorities refused to release the flight path of the squadron, but it is speculated that they were flying along the Pan American Airways trans-Pacific flight path. This flight arrived here from San Diego on June 28, when the commander was Lieutenant Colonel LaHachey. The aircraft are painted with the American flag. This flight is the first time that U.S. fighter aircraft have crossed the International Date Line to the west. U.S. aircraft have conducted many exercises in Midway Island, but have never officially flown to Guam or Wake Island. According to unofficial reports, a naval tanker is now between Midway Island and Guam, protecting the aircraft carrier Langley. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Mr. Suma Yakichiro, the former counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Washington, arrived in Yokohama yesterday and told a reporter from the Daily News that the American sentiment toward Japan is much worse than is understood in Japan. The phrase popular among young American naval officers is "Never forget the Panay Incident". Asked why the United States abolished the trade agreement with Japan, Suma expressed his opinion that the China Incident has caused many missionaries to lose their jobs. These people stirred up American women and have a great influence on public opinion. Another important thing is that the American Navy has an unusually bad feeling towards Japan. Japan is a large customer of American goods, so he believes that Japan should suggest concluding a new commercial treaty with a very frank attitude and not guess the attitude of the United States. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Prevents Price Increases; Implements National Mobilization Law, Articles 11 and 19 of Chapter VI</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch. In order to prevent prices from rising further, the Japanese government today announced an order implementing Articles 11 and 19 of Chapter VI of the National Mobilization Law, prohibiting prices, freight, wharfage fees, insurance fees, rent, handling fees, and wages from exceeding the market price of September 18. Domestic house rent and land rent will be reduced to the rental rate of September 4 last year, and those in Korea will be reduced to the rental rate of December last year. The effect of the ban does not apply to export trade. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>New York Exchange Situation; Pound Sterling Sees Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>New York – At the close of the New York foreign exchange market today, the price of the British pound rose slightly, recovering from the low of $3.77 yesterday to $3.91. It is said that this was due to the fact that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau threatened last night to find a way to crack down on the two-tiered price market. However, many quarters believe that today's pound sterling rally may not have any direct relationship with the remarks of the U.S. Treasury Secretary or official intervention. The reason is probably that the forward selling of neutral European countries has dried up. The French franc, Dutch guilder, and other European currencies have all risen slightly today, but the Italian lira remains weak. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Stimson and Others Conduct Anti-Isolationist Propaganda; Advocate Revising Current Neutrality Law; Roosevelt to Appeal to Congress Today</h3>
<p>Washington – Former Secretary of State Stimson, a prominent Republican figure, and Columbia University President Butler are launching a large-scale propaganda campaign in various newspapers, advocating for the revision of the current neutrality law and the repeal of the arms embargo clause. Butler also published an article criticizing the remarks of isolationists and Republican Senator Borah, stating that the outbreak of the current war in Europe and the slow recovery of American industry are all the responsibility of these individuals. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt is preparing to address a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday regarding neutrality. The speech is expected to take place around 3 PM (2 AM Friday, Shanghai time). According to President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. Early, to reporters, the President's speech will be very brief. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington – The White House announced last night that President Roosevelt intends to attend Congress tomorrow to personally request the repeal of the arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act. The Senate and House of Representatives will convene a joint session tomorrow afternoon at 2 PM (Eastern Standard Time) to hear the President's personal appeal. The White House stated that the President's attendance time may be subject to change, and the President must wait until Congress has completed its routine reorganization work before attending and delivering his address. President's secretary Early stated that the President's message to Congress would be brief. He did not specify how the President would request the amendment of the Neutrality Act. Republican Senator Vandenberg (an isolationist) from Michigan has returned to Washington. He stated that the debate on amending the Neutrality Act during the special session of Congress would be non-partisan. He hopes that the debate will not be lengthy or overly heated. Vandenberg will meet with the President and other members of Congress at the White House today. He stated that he would demand that the arms embargo clause be retained, as this clause can keep the country out of conflict more safely than the "cash and carry" plan. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has ordered the number of Coast Guard personnel to be increased from 15,000 to 17,000. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>New York – It was announced here today that, to prevent labor strikes, the 10,000-ton battleship "Helena," which was originally scheduled to begin service on Monday, has been postponed and will not be put into service until the Brooklyn Navy Yard has laid off 9,000 civilian workers. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan Declares No Armed German Vessels Allowed</h3>
<p>London – Official circles announced that the Japanese naval authorities have notified the British naval attaché in Tokyo that Japan will not allow German vessels in its ports to be armed, as this would violate Japan's neutrality. According to Japanese newspapers, there have been recent reports that the North German Lloyd passenger ship "Scharnhorst," currently docked in Kobe, is being converted into a warship to attack merchant vessels. There are many speedboats around the ship, and the ship is extremely busy. Some observers believe that this is a sign that the ship is preparing to be armed. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London – The Information Department announced yesterday that the Japanese naval authorities recently informed the British Embassy's naval attaché that Japan will not allow Germany to arm merchant ships currently staying off the Japanese coast, as this would be detrimental to Japan's neutrality. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Ceasefire Agreement Implementation Measures Agreed Upon by Military Representatives</h3>
<p>Nomonhan – The Japanese and Soviet representatives negotiating the ceasefire held their second formal meeting on the 19th. After three hours, both sides reached a consensus on implementing the ceasefire measures in accordance with the Togo-Molotov Agreement: (1) The local military representatives of Japan and the Soviet Union should cease hostilities on the Khalkhin Gol front in accordance with the Togo-Molotov Agreement. (2) Neither the Japanese nor the Soviet armies shall increase their forces on the front lines or strengthen their positions. (3) The Japanese and Soviet armies shall exchange maps, indicating the forwardmost positions of each side. (4) Procedures for extraditing the bodies of fallen soldiers: (A) Representatives from the Japanese and Soviet armies shall command their subordinates to exchange bodies at a point midway between the front lines of the two armies on the Khalkha River. (B) The period for exchanging bodies shall be from the 21st to the 25th. (C) Bodies between the positions of the two armies shall be recovered freely by each side. (5) Procedures for exchanging prisoners of war: (A) The Japanese army shall transport the Soviet prisoners of war it holds in freight cars to the negotiation site and return them to the Soviet side. (B) The number of Japanese prisoners of war is extremely small, and they are all seriously injured and cannot be transported back by freight cars. Therefore, Soviet aircraft will transport them to a suitable location, and then return them to the Japanese side. (C) The period for exchanging prisoners of war shall be within one week from September 19th. (Allied News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Nomonhan – The Japanese army is scheduled to hold a memorial service for the fallen soldiers at General's Temple on the 20th. Upon hearing this news, the Soviet army notified the Japanese side that it intended to send representatives to attend and pay their respects. The Japanese authorities decided to accept the Soviet army's good intentions. This action by the Soviet Union will brighten the atmosphere on the border, and the Khalkhin Gol area is filled with an atmosphere of peace. (Allied News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Spain Reaffirms Neutrality; Franco Postpones Italy Visit Indefinitely</h3>
<p>Madrid – The Alcazar newspaper published an editorial today with the headline, "Reaffirming and Maintaining Neutrality." It stated, "After the Soviet army entered Poland, Britain and France still declared their determination to fight to the end. Our country's neutrality policy is sufficient to represent genuine public opinion and should not be swayed by this new situation. On the contrary, it should be reaffirmed and strengthened. The current situation is different from that of 1914. If the people of our country still favor one side over the other among the belligerent nations, the government must order them to return to reason." (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>The Key to War and Peace in the Future Depends on Britain's Attitude; German-Soviet Division of Poland Does Not Allow Interference from Other Countries; If Germany Is Forced to Fight, It Will Definitely Deal with It Accordingly; Full Text of Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Danzig – Führer Hitler delivered a speech here this afternoon. The main points are as follows: (1) Declared that Poland's future will be entirely decided by Germany and the Soviet Union, because both countries have vital interests in Poland. Germany and the Soviet Union will never allow Poland to return to the form of the Treaty of Versailles. (2) Germany and the Soviet Union are determined to promote friendly relations and create a situation in which Western European democracies have nothing to gain. Therefore, anyone who believes that a conflict will occur between Germany and the Soviet Union is completely wrong. (3) Hitler claimed, "I and the German nation have no intention of fighting against Britain and France. The true purpose of those who incite war in Britain is to overthrow the current German government, but the German people have always been educated in National Socialism. It is wishful thinking to expect them to overthrow this system. However, although Germany has no intention of fighting against Britain, if Britain continues its inhumane war of blockading women and children, then Germany may be forced to resort to arms. However, this matter is determined by Britain." (4) Finally, Hitler solemnly declared, "Danzig will forever be a part of Germany and will never be separated from Greater Germanic Germany." (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Danzig – Führer Hitler delivered a speech at 5 PM this afternoon in the largest square in the city of Danzig. After the administrative commissioner of Danzig, Forster, gave an introductory speech, Hitler took the stage and spoke, first expressing his joy at setting foot in Danzig. He then said that although this was his first visit to Danzig, Danzig had belonged to Germany for five hundred years before the white people migrated to New Zealand. Unfortunately, the World War separated it from Germany, and the Treaty of Versailles plunged the world into chaos. Those who incited the war and those who cleaned up the mess after the war were deceiving themselves in the same way. Not only did they fail to solve any problems, but they also created countless difficulties and disputes from this peace. Germany will sooner or later rise to solve the aforementioned disputes, but it is only a matter of time. One of the most important things is that those who were domineering at the time completely ignored the facts. Regardless of whether the British warmongers are happy with us or not, the people of Danzig are still alive and cannot be hidden from the eyes and ears of the world. And now Germany, which has 82 million Germans, regardless of whether the warmongers approve of us or not, these 82 million people have a common desire to live together and will live together. All the areas ceded to Poland, their development was due to the work of the Germans. According to the results of the plebiscites held at that time, no one wanted to be a part of Poland. However, Danzig was ultimately a victim of madness, and Poland became a product lacking rationality.</p>
<p>Hitler then commented on Poland's past 20 years, forcefully stating that Poland's creation was due to the sacrifice of millions of lives, the sacrifice of land cultivated by Germans, and the sacrifice of all reason and economic possibility. Moreover, the Poles could not maintain the culture created by the Germans, because only those who can create culture have the ability to maintain culture. Poland is a country composed of many ethnic groups, just like the former Austria. The suffering suffered by the Germans over the past 20 years does not need to be described in detail. In a word, "It is a tragic fact."</p>
<p>Hitler mentioned at this point his initial efforts to follow a peaceful path to solve the Polish problem, as well as the agreement signed with the late Polish President Marshal Piłsudski, believing that this agreement was the foundation for promoting peaceful understanding between the German and Polish nations, and that at least the Treaty of Versailles could be used to seek the establishment of reasonable friendly relations. When Marshal Piłsudski was alive, these efforts seemed to have a prospect of success. However, after Piłsudski's death, the situation changed drastically, and the oppression suffered by the Germans became increasingly severe. However, the whole world turned a blind eye and deaf ear to it. Germany is a great power, so it is intolerable for the Germans to be abused by inferior countries. This is a situation of oppression and rebellion. What is even more reprehensible are the following situations: (1) Preventing cities of German character from joining Germany and using various methods to Polonize them. (2) Provinces separated from the German mainland have no direct transportation and must rely on Poland's goodwill or cunning. No great power in the world can tolerate this state of affairs as long as Germany.</p>
<p>Hitler mentioned the suggestions he made to Poland, saying, "I carefully considered and was responsible for presenting this solution to the Polish government. I made this suggestion to avoid the war between the German and Polish people." After elaborating on the details of the suggestions, Hitler declared, "I do not know what Poland's intention is in rejecting this suggestion, but I know that the Germans feel relieved. Poland's reply was to order mobilization. The Polish Foreign Minister rejected my invitation and refused to come to Berlin to meet, but went to London for negotiations. Therefore, in the following months, the threat continued to increase, which was intolerable for any great power."</p>
<p>Hitler continued by saying that Polish newspapers often demanded the annexation of East Prussia and Pomerania and that the Elbe River should be the Polish border. Poland firmly believed that if its military strength was insufficient to realize this plan, it could obtain assistance from other countries. However, the countries regard Poland as a tool to achieve their goals. Now they are singing loudly that the main problem is Germany's system, not Poland. You should remember my speeches in Saarbrücken and Wilhelmshaven. In these speeches, I mentioned several countries where civilians can freely make speeches and talk about the necessity of war, such as Churchill, Eden, and Cooper. I pointed out their danger because I did not know when they would organize. Currently, they have joined the government. I warned the German people at the time but was convinced that Germany would never succumb to their threats and violence. The war movement is gradually developing in democratic countries, because freedom of speech allows foreign governments, politicians, and even heads of state to be attacked, slandered, and insulted at will. However, totalitarian countries emphasize discipline and will never allow this kind of phenomenon to occur. The agitation of war can be carried out in undisciplined countries, but not in disciplined countries. Therefore, the people of undisciplined countries are incited to fight, while the people of disciplined countries do not know how to prepare for war. Therefore, Hitler decided to warn the public and place the country on a defensive foundation so as not to be attacked.</p>
<p>Hitler commented on the situation in August, stating, "I firmly believe that if there was no British guarantee and the agitation of those who worship war, an understanding could have been reached at that time. Britain suggested direct negotiations between Germany and Poland. Germany accepted this suggestion, but Poland continued to refuse." After months of waiting and repeatedly making suggestions, he decided to "use the only language that Poland understands." Hitler mentioned Italy's mediation, saying, "Italy is our friendly country. After Mussolini made a suggestion for mediation, France accepted it, and Germany also agreed, but Britain refused and wanted to make an impossible demand to Germany with a two-hour ultimatum. However, Britain has misunderstood. Today's Germany cannot be regarded as the Germany of 1918. London should recognize that it cannot deliver an ultimatum to today's Germany. Germany will never tolerate this tone."</p>
<p>I know that when Poland decided to go to war, it thought that it could obtain political and financial benefits in this war and was incited by the statistics of Western European politicians, that is, the German army is not to be feared, the German army's equipment is inferior, the morale is declining, the people all have a mentality of defeat, and the German people are opposed to the leaders. Poland firmly believes that it can not only resist the German army but also defeat the German army. Therefore, with the assistance of foreign staff officers, it prepared for war against Germany. However, only 18 days after the start of the war, the German army had advanced to the line of Lviv and Brest. The Polish army in the Kutno area completely collapsed and was captured. The number of prisoners yesterday morning was 20,000, last night it was 50,000, and this morning it was 70,000. It is completely unknown how much the current number has increased. But I am sure that if the Polish army west of the Lviv-Brest line does not surrender in the next few days, it will be completely annihilated. The German army has taught this smart politician a lesson. They also know the situation in Germany well. General Smigly-Rydz has gone in the wrong direction, just like other Polish leaders. He did not fly to Berlin but to Cernăuţi. Polish soldiers fought bravely, but the junior officers lacked military knowledge, and the senior leaders were completely incapable. Currently, there are 300,000 Polish soldiers in German prisoner-of-war camps, including 2,000 officers and several generals. However, we admit that the bravery of the Polish junior soldiers is commendable, but some of Poland's actions are so vile that they are unparalleled in the world, such as the abuse of German women and children, gouging out eyes, and cutting off noses, and the torture of German prisoners of war. The Polish government's radio station has openly admitted that German airmen who parachuted down were killed by Polish troops. However, I have not heard any politicians in democratic countries protest against this barbaric act. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? I would like to repeat and reiterate that this situation cannot be maintained for long. "Now we have crushed Poland in 18 days and created an environment in which we can have reasonable and calm talks with representatives of the Polish nation."</p>
<p>Hitler then spoke at length about German-Russian cooperation, declaring that the Soviet Union, in order to protect the interests of Belarus and Ukraine, believed that it was necessary to send troops into Poland. As for the cooperation between Germany and Russia, Germany maintains its original appearance, and Russia also maintains its original style. However, the two countries agree on one thing, that is, not to fight each other, so as to prevent the Western countries from profiting from it. We have tasted the experiences of the four years of the World War. From now on, we are determined to defend our own interests, and the understanding between the two countries is sufficient to completely achieve this goal. The British politicians have repeatedly spread rumors that Germany's political ambitions will encompass the Ural Mountains, and even said that their decision to fight against Germany is to overthrow this government that wants to dominate Europe. The British politicians are obviously uneasy. I would like to take this opportunity to solemnly inform the British politicians that Germany has no ambition to conquer Ukraine. The Soviet Union and Germany have reached an agreement, and Britain can no longer worry about Germany's ambitions. As for how Poland should be constructed, this matter should be decided by Germany and Russia, whose vital interests are at stake. Germany's limited but unchangeable demands have been known to the whole world. Germany and Russia should do their best to turn the source of the European conflagration into an area without tension. If the Western countries do not agree, or Britain is determined to wage a three-year or five-year war, then my reply is as follows: Germany has accepted the current borders as the final borders. I have no desire to fight against Britain or France. Since I came to power, I have done my best to establish close relations with the enemy countries in the European War and have successfully eliminated the friction between Germany and Italy. I have also made the same efforts for France. After the Saar issue was resolved, I solemnly declared that there was no need to modify Germany's western border. I have also repeatedly made efforts for Britain, trying to establish sincere friendship. If Britain refuses and really wants to fight against Germany, then I can make the following reply:</p>
<p>Poland can never return to the form of the Treaty of Versailles. Not only does Germany guarantee this, but the Soviet Union also guarantees this. Then the true purpose of Britain's war is not to protect Poland, but to overthrow Germany's current government. It must be known that the German people have been trained in National Socialism and can never accept the system advocated by Churchill, Cooper, and Eden. If the enemy wants to engage in a three-year war, I am very sorry for the French soldiers. They have nothing to ask for and only know the glory of fighting for three years. If a three-year war really breaks out, then Germany will never succumb, whether it is three years, four years, or even six or seven years. Britain relies on its superior navy and imposes a blockade on women and children. They must not be mistaken, because if Germany is forced to use a certain weapon, I am afraid that the British navy will not know what to do. As for how to fight the war, we will decide according to Britain's methods. Britain is not fighting against the German government, but against German women and children. Then Germany will also repay the British in the same way as the British treat others. In short, Germany will never succumb. We are determined to deal with it to the end. Danzig, after 20 years of separation, has now returned to Germany and will never be separated from the motherland again. The entire German people will defend it with their last breath.

<h3>London Rumors: Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan Plan to Divide Europe and Asia; The Soviet Union Continues to Aid China</h3>
<p>London: According to unverified rumors here, Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan are currently planning to divide Europe and Asia, with Germany controlling Europe, the Soviet Union dominating India, and Japan dominating the Far East. However, according to reliable sources, Japan's hope that the Soviet Union would cease its aid to China is bound to fail. Even if the Soviet Union and Japan establish a non-aggression treaty, the Soviet Union's trade with China, including trade, will not be affected. Furthermore, according to Chinese sources here, China's resistance against Japan has made it impossible for Japan to implement its policy of aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Chinese side is confident that Moscow will continue to aid China. According to another message, the Soviet Union is currently planning to sign a treaty with other countries to prevent the intrusion of German forces into the Black Sea region.

<h3>Ministry of Education: Compilation and Distribution of Teaching Materials for Mass Education. Over 2,000 Copies Distributed in the Last Two Years</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The teaching materials used in promoting supplementary education for illiterate people are of utmost importance. The Ministry of Education has paid special attention to the compilation of textbooks. In the past two years, the ministry has approved and distributed over 2,000 copies to various provinces and cities. The progress of this work is outlined below: (A) "Textbooks for People's Schools": The textbooks for the national language course in people's schools were prepared at the beginning of the Six-Year Plan. The content carefully selected materials on civic knowledge, music, and other subjects, compiled in a mixed format. The entire series consists of four volumes, suitable for four months of use in elementary people's schools. (B) "Teaching Methods for People's School Textbooks": The teaching methods, closely related to the textbooks, were compiled immediately after the people's school textbooks were completed. All four volumes were completed in April of the 26th year (of the Republic) and printed and distributed to various provinces and cities for application. (C) "Arithmetic Textbooks and Teaching Methods for People's Schools": For the arithmetic courses in people's schools, the Ministry has compiled two types of teaching materials: "People's School Written Arithmetic Textbook" and "People's School Abacus Textbook," each in one volume. Each type also has a corresponding volume of teaching methods to meet the needs. (D) "Musical Song Teaching Materials for People's Schools": The teaching materials for music and songs in people's schools consist of selecting rhythmic texts from the textbooks, totaling fifteen lessons, and matching them with musical scores for combined teaching with the texts. To facilitate learning and dissemination, gramophone records were made for all songs. Expert Zhao Yuanren was invited to create the scores and record the songs, which were distributed to various provinces and cities for use and played in movie theaters. Songs such as "Self-Defense," "Resistance," "Love the Country," and "Reading is Good" have been widely sung by the general public and spread for a time. (E) "Textbooks for Advanced People's Schools": After completing the textbooks for people's schools, the ministry continued to compile textbooks for advanced people's schools, totaling four volumes. They are now completed and undergoing trial teaching. (F) "Wartime Textbooks for People's Schools": The aforementioned textbooks for people's schools were compiled before the War of Resistance. There were certain concerns regarding the ideological aspects. After the July 7th Incident, to meet wartime needs and achieve rapid results, another type of textbooks for people's schools was specially compiled for application. This set of textbooks is divided into two volumes and can be used for two months of teaching in short-term people's schools. The printing of the above textbooks was undertaken by various printing houses, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Datong Book Company, Beixin Bookstore, and Xinguang Printing House. They were distributed to various provinces and cities in two installments each year. After the compilation of the Type B textbooks for people's schools, the domestic transportation was affected by the war, making delivery quite inconvenient. The Ministry of Education provided subsidies for the printing costs as appropriate.</p>
<h3>A Contribution to Students Applying to the National Southwestern Associated University (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— (Sent by Shen Jiayou from Kunming)</p>
<p>When students first arrive, they can stay at a hotel near the station for one night. The next day, they can go to the main office to complete the procedures and then move into the dormitory, which is more appropriate. The Provincial Department of Education has a Youth Hostel located in Jinghong Elementary School on Fuzhao Street. Students who do not wish to or cannot stay in a hotel can contact the hostel.</p>
<p>Regarding the journey, the shortest route from Shanghai to Yunnan takes seven days – two days by postal ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, two days by postal ship from Hong Kong to Vietnam, and one day by train from Vietnam to Yunnan (Michelin Express). There is a one-day stopover in Haiphong and Hong Kong. Usually, due to waiting for trains and ships, it often takes about two weeks. If you take a Taikoo ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai, it takes four days. Shantou is the most troublesome place along the way. Students are not experienced travelers, so luggage is easily lost here. When the ship is about to dock, be sure to put all loose items and luggage together and adhere to the principle of "never let go of anything." Only after these porters, who can also be described as opportunistic thieves, have left can you enjoy the scenery. I was taught a lesson by them, so I hope the students pay attention. When you arrive in Hong Kong, you can see some exotic flavors. Your passport must be signed by the French consulate. The mountain cable car is a unique feature of Hong Kong and worth a ride. Kowloon is just across from Hong Kong. If time permits, you can also take a ferry to visit. The Hong Kong-Vietnam section does not have dangerous docks like Shantou, but you cannot ignore the Annamese thieves. After all, it is foreign goods, and stealing fountain pens is their specialty. In Haiphong, a reliable hotel can take care of your luggage and take it to customs for inspection. Tianran Hotel is the most influential. Your luggage can be inspected first. Once the inspection is complete and everything is correct, you have overcome all the difficulties from Shanghai to Yunnan. At this time, you can plan your train journey. Although the Michelin Express is fast, it is not suitable for students with luggage. Generally, taking the fourth-class slow train is more economical and allows you to carry more luggage. You need to change trains in Hanoi or Jialin. The latter allows you to arrive in Kunming a day earlier, but the scenery of the former is better, and it is worth visiting. You need to get off the train and stay in hotels in Laogai and Kaiyuan. The luggage can be taken care of by the station, so you can rest assured. There are many mountain caves along the way. Students in poorer health should prepare a wet towel to avoid coal gas. After arriving in Laogai, the opposite side is the Chinese border, known as Hekou. In Kaiyuan, you can see countless strong men being trained. At this time, you will feel like a child who has been wandering abroad and is returning home, with indescribable joy. But when kind relatives and friends wave their hats to greet you, don't be too shy to speak!</p>
<p>The most important thing when passing through foreign countries is your passport. If you get it in Hong Kong, it will cost six Hong Kong dollars, which is very uneconomical considering the current exchange rate. Therefore, if you have relatives or friends in Yunnan, it is better to ask them to get it for you. It only costs four yuan, which is much cheaper than in Hong Kong. If two people come together, you can take a group photo and apply for one passport together, which can save you half the cost.</p>
<p>The most difficult and troublesome part of the journey from Shanghai to Yunnan is the inspection in Haiphong. It often leads to emptying boxes and losing things, which is expected. The fines are also at the discretion of the customs officers. They take what they like, so it is best to bring less of what can be saved. It is advisable to avoid new items, but if necessary, bring as much as possible, because prices in Kunming are frighteningly high. Even with the fines, it is sometimes cheaper. Place small items at the bottom of the box during inspection, and keep important items in your pocket for safety. Students who can speak French can take great advantage at this time. Therefore, if possible, please bring a French group certificate signed by the school, which may reduce some trouble. The boxes should be opened by yourself during inspection, so keep the key with you to avoid temporary confusion. The China Travel Service publishes travel guides, which can be used as reference for purchasing tickets and selecting ships. If you want the agency to provide accommodation, you can contact them. Finally, I wish you success in your exams and hope you come soon. (The End)</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuates, HSBC Lists Increase Across the Board, U.S. Dollar Black Market Reaches Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listings increase across the board due to the sudden rise in the US-British exchange rate. The British exchange rate rose by 0.025 to 3/4 shillings and 75 pence, while the US dollar rose by 0.0625 to 6.125 yuan. With the exception of the German exchange rate, which had no market, all others increased uniformly. The internal market opened in the morning, and the situation showed signs of tightness for the British pound and stability for the US dollar. Although various rumors in the market gradually dissipated during the day, people still felt uncertain, so fluctuations were frequent, making it difficult to predict the situation. Generally, the situation was loose at first and then tight. Initially, because Chinese merchants and banks competed fiercely and foreign banks' appetite to buy was weak, the market was quite loose. The British pound once reached 4 shillings and 375 pence, and the US dollar broke through the 7 yuan mark, reaching 7.125 yuan. Later, a certain bank's appetite to buy suddenly increased, aggressively buying at low prices. In addition, Chinese merchants and banks also stopped selling aggressively, so the situation suddenly returned to normal. As a result, the British pound closed at 4 shillings and 25 pence, and the US dollar closed at 6.875 yuan. Because the settlement period for this month's futures was approaching, there was a squeeze, and sometimes the selling price of foreign banks was the same as the spot price. The price difference between the spot price and the October futures initially followed suit, with the US dollar rising to 7 yuan, but then gradually returned to normal. According to the noon closing, the price difference between the spot price and the October price was 0.03125 for the British pound and 0.1875 for the US dollar, with a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of only about 2.7%. Moreover, it was actually difficult to obtain, so arbitrageurs disappeared. Trading was still active for half a day.</p>
<p>The result was stable for the US dollar and slightly tight for the British pound.</p>

<h3>Cash Suddenly Dropped in the Evening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash market, due to the many twists and turns in foreign exchange, and with people's hearts erratic, the day's changes were still dramatic, roughly first pouring and then soaring, but the initial opening was still stable, opening in the morning at 3,910 yuan. After a certain gold shop pushed up, it continued to rise to 3,940 yuan. Afterwards, foreign exchange both official and black market suddenly loosened, causing a selling wave. Money changers and others rushed to sell at market prices, and in addition, most retail long positions also sought to sell, so it plunged downwards, plummeting to a low of 3,750 yuan. However, it was very temporary, and then a certain gold shop's long positions added leverage at low prices, the situation returned high, and soon encouraged by the foreign exchange return tight, and the previous day's peaceful air, most believed that it was difficult to achieve from the front, and then the Hong Kong gang suddenly bought, so the price then reversal soared, up to 3,990 yuan peak, but because 4,000 yuan eye price sellers are crowded, resulting in the rise of the wind frustrated, noon closed at 3,970 yuan, afternoon situation slightly stable, early will retreat to 3,945 yuan, after someone a certain gold shop on behalf of customers aggressively, again up to 3,990 yuan, but the result was 3,980 yuan closing, compared to the previous back up 40 yuan, heard that after closing due to a certain negative news, a sudden fall of the wind, fell back to 3,900 yuan inside, trading is still旺, 2,000餘兩, silversmiths are finally挂小五元, customs gold and other fixed as before,</p>

<h3>Securities. Domestic Debt Firm and Rising. Bulls Take Profits and Sell. Weakness Returns Slightly in the Afternoon.</h3>
<p>Trading in securities on the grey market yesterday saw sustained interest. However, a considerable number of investors were taking profits. As a result, market prices failed to surge forward. Moreover, the international situation remains unpredictable, which has significant implications for China. Major players are closely monitoring developments, awaiting official news. Yesterday's trading saw an initial rise followed by a decline. Category C shares briefly broke through the 45 yuan mark, but the market then retreated. Morning purchases focused on the 20th and 25th issues, as well as shares of Da Feng and Tong Kang. Da Tong and Lian Yi saw some selling, with retail investors dominating the rest of the trading. Market sentiment weakened in the afternoon, and fewer buyers entered the market. Lian Yi continued to be sold off, and Ren Chang and Yu Ji also saw selling. Prices retreated by a few jiao (tenths of a yuan), resulting in a slight overall increase of two to three jiao. Total transaction volume still exceeded one million yuan. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 20 shares of Guohua Bank were traded at a price of 38.5 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The Public Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's stock market saw little change. The recently announced final dividend of 5 yuan per share for Hong Kong and Shanghai Wharf and Godown Company shares coincided with general expectations, thus having no significant impact on market conditions. Jardine Matheson Textile shares suddenly fell in the last half hour, reportedly due to rumors that the interim dividend payment was uncertain and unlikely to occur in the near future. Without other significant underlying factors, these rumors are likely to manipulate the market for some time.</p>
<p>London, 19th. Today's listed prices for Far East British company stocks were calm for both banking and rubber shares. Shanghai Waterworks A shares and Shanghai Insurance shares opened for the first time today. Waterworks shares were priced at £10, the same as the lowest price at the end of last month. Insurance shares opened at £19, a decrease of £3 from the previous price. The rest have not yet opened.</p>
<p>London, 19th. Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained the same for the three types of British and French loans, with stable market conditions. The rest have not yet opened.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton. Conflicting Rumors. Cotton Yarn Sees Widespread Selling. "Double Horse" Yarn Falls 33 Yuan, "Earth" Yarn Drops 25 Yuan.</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the downward trend is intensifying, mainly due to conflicting rumors and uncertainty in the market. At the same time, sales in the South China region remain sluggish, with all purchases being small, scattered transactions. The market is generally listless and lacking momentum. Overinflated prices are causing instability under the shroud of rumors. However, well-capitalized players are still buying on dips when the market falls sharply. The lowest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn reached 735 yuan. Sellers then repurchased, bringing the price back up to 760 yuan. The current situation suggests a small pullback, as raw cotton arrivals are robust and prices are easing.</p>
<p>The yarn market is now weak and sellers are dominant. The opening price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn is down 15 yuan at 780 yuan. Warehouse receipts are falling more sharply, down 25 yuan to 700 yuan. Shortly after, news of a drop in gold prices spread, and selling pressure intensified, pushing prices down further. The spot price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell to 735 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 680 yuan. As the closing bell approached, positive news emerged, and the yarn market rose 20 yuan. A mid-day transaction tally showed that 1,275 bales were sold. 20-count "Double Horse" fell 33 yuan, "Double Earth" fell 25 yuan, "Five Goats" rose and fell 10 yuan, and "Shepherd" fell 7.5 yuan. The sales volume for various merchant groups is listed below.</p>
<h3>Unimpeded Supply from Northern Jiangsu. "White Bag" Cotton Falls 10 Yuan.</h3>
<p>Trading in "white bag" cotton continued unabated today, but sales were not as strong as in the past. Market prices continued to trend downward, falling by 10 yuan. This is because the supply from northern Jiangsu is unimpeded, and there are expectations of further arrivals. The reason is that prices in the interior are extremely cheap. If transported to Shanghai, the profits would be enormous. As a result, everyone is scrambling to gather and transport cotton, leading to a surge in recent arrivals. Factories, seeing the unimpeded supply, are relaxing their purchasing efforts. As a result, 3,000 to 4,000 bales continued to arrive at the docks today, and everyone is waiting and watching. Opening prices were held until the afternoon before trading began, and the market fell 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Not all bales were sold. Another account suggests most bales were sold. The drop in cotton prices is not surprising, as 20-count "Double Horse" cotton yarn has fallen by over 100 yuan in the past two days. The opening price for top-quality Tonghua cotton was 160 yuan. Assuming 142 yuan, the drop is only 18 yuan. If the cotton yarn is calculated proportionally, there is still potential for further declines. It is also reported that cotton is being transported directly to Shanghai from all directions. However, it is said that the cotton purchased by Fuh Chia is likely being shipped to the Qingdao textile mill. Yesterday, 860 bales of cotton arrived from Beisha. The current cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Another report: Trading in imported cotton in Shanghai has been quiet recently due to widespread rumors. All parties are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. However, Japanese merchants are still actively ordering new cotton, although less so than a few days ago. Yesterday's asking price for White River cotton was 172 yuan, and for Pingguoer cotton, 125 yuan. Transactions were scarce. The general opinion is that cotton prices will continue to rise in the coming days, so traders are unwilling to sell at low prices.</p>
<p>Imported cotton prices: New York cotton prices were weak in the early morning due to widespread selling, falling 4-5 points. Later, due to firmer stock prices on Wall Street, cotton prices also rebounded slightly. By the close, prices were not much different from the previous day. Indian rapid cotton is predicted to fall 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton to fall over 30 points, and Liverpool cotton to fall over 10 pence.</p>
<h3>Grain. New Xian Rice Arrives in Shanghai in Bulk. Traders Are Eager to Unload. Asking Prices Fall Sharply.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, no Du Geng rice arrived from the He Xia region. However, over 7,000 bags of new rice from various locations continued to arrive via the Che Lun Baozi route. The continuous flow of arrivals has further weakened market sentiment. Coupled with recent price controls, business at retail stores is slow, and the sales market is also sluggish. Traders with large inventories are eager to unload. The market opened weakly and continued to decline, without any signs of recovery. As a result, thick Geng rice fell by about one yuan, and new sharp rice fell by one to one and a half yuan. Specifically, top-quality Chang Geng rice was 41 yuan, top-quality Xi Geng rice was 39 yuan, high-quality rice was 37 yuan, medium-quality rice was 35 yuan, and Su Tong Kun Geng rice was 34.5 yuan. Early and late rice from the He Xia region were relatively firm due to the lack of arrivals, and fell slightly by half a yuan, to 31.5 to 31 yuan. The original bags were 34 yuan. New Geng rice from Kunshan, Minhang, Zhuanqiao, and Zhoupu fell by two to three yuan due to the large number of arrivals and the soft consistency of the rice, making it difficult to maintain prices. Kun Min Zhuan Geng rice was 30 to 29 yuan, and Zhoupu Geng rice was 28 to 29 yuan. Kunshan Xiang Geng rice, being a seasonal specialty and only available in quantities of 20 to 30 dan (approximately 1000-1500 kg), opened at 40 to 39 yuan. New Yangjian rice from Kunshan, Suzhou, Jiaxing, and Jiashan was 26.5 to 26 yuan, Tuanjian rice was 26 to 25.5 yuan, Lingbaijian rice was 27 to 26.5 yuan, new Jiangbei Jian rice was 25.5 to 25 yuan, new Wuhu Jian rice was 24.5 to 24 yuan, Chen Jian rice was 25 yuan, Bian Yuan rice was 34 yuan, and Hong Kong high-quality Tuanli glutinous rice was 35 yuan. Medium-quality pointed-grain that rice was 34 yuan. The total volume of transactions in the market was over 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>After the previous market shifted positions, new Jiangbei Xian rice and other varieties arrived in bulk yesterday, and Du Xian rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang also flooded in via the Che Lun route. Buyers lost their appetite, and sellers, fearing further price declines due to rumors of improved transportation and the influx of new Xian rice from various locations, were more eager to sell. As a result, the middle price of each type of rice fell by nearly one yuan, and the high-end price also fell by more than half a yuan. High-quality Ke Xian rice was 26 yuan, and the middle price ranged from 25 yuan to 23.5-6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Prices. Opening at 7 Yuan Cash. Wheat Is Also Weak.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, flour mill prices for spot flour fell by two jiao, opening at 7 yuan cash. This is because retail sales on the Lianbai Ben Street were weak, and customers from both the North and South were waiting for previously ordered goods to be loaded. New transactions were not strong, and the market was also affected by the dumping of Japanese flour. As a result, various mills had to make concessions. It is said that returned goods also fell with the mill prices, dropping below the 7 yuan mark. Prices for foreign flour were also easing due to weak overseas reports. Total transactions in the market, including those by domestic and foreign customers, totaled just under 20,000 bags. 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Singapore today.</p>
<p>The wheat market was even more depressed yesterday due to the continuous arrival of goods and the wait-and-see attitude of mills and merchants. Although Japanese mills were buying, they were suppressing prices severely, causing the market to slump.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods. Tianjin Red Dates Are Scarce.</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of inventory of Tianjin red dates in the market, they will soon be out of stock. Therefore, traders are asking for extremely high prices. Date kings are priced at 200 yuan, date heads at 160 yuan, top-quality dates at 120 yuan, and second-quality dates at 70 yuan. Retailers find these prices too high, and there are few transactions. It is said that sellers are planning to switch to cash-only sales for future goods.</p>
<h3>Oil Market. Japanese Merchants Dumped Future Soybean Oil, Causing Another Drop of 2-3 Yuan.</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market was shrouded in negative news and the impact of Japanese merchants dumping future oil. (Japanese merchants learned their lesson in the first half of the year and rarely engage in future oil trading.) This caused buyers to hesitate and the market sentiment to slump, falling another 2-3 yuan from the lowest price of the previous day. Only 80 barrels of Kobe oil were traded (priced at 57.4 yuan), and 20 barrels of Dalian oil (priced at 56.8 yuan).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods. Retail Autumn Sales Begin. Customer Purchases Are Also Strong. Prices, However, Are Falling.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the domestic cloth market continued its downward trend due to widespread rumors and anxieties. Stockpilers were inclined to sell, and the resumption of shipping to Wenzhou suffered a setback. Although another attempt was made to sail, the hope was slim. Affected by this, the cloth market saw selling prices decline step by step. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth fell by 1-5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by 2.5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece. Velvet and non-fading cloth prices were relatively stable. Retail sales in Ben Street began for the autumn season, and business was quite strong. However, due to falling prices, everyone except those with urgent needs took a wait-and-see approach. Demand was especially strong in Northern Jiangsu, Ju Ning, Qinzhou, and Bengbu Gaoqiu. Transactions included over 5,000 pieces of khaki, serge, colored cloth, and printed cloth. Southern merchants and Hong Kong merchants purchased several thousand pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, red foreign-label printed cloth, and bleached and dyed cloth. Guangdong and Ningbo merchants purchased over 100 boxes of colored twill, colored cloth, serge, and other goods. It was found that 117 pieces of cloth were shipped to Singapore today.</p>
<p>The morning market for Eastern piece goods saw a sharp drop in white goods, due to falling yarn prices and panic among stockpilers. Everyone was rushing to sell. The smallest price for top-quality fine cloth was 21.6-7 yuan per piece. Later, because Ben Street merchants still had good intentions and were buying on dips, 400-500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were traded, and prices gradually rebounded. As a result, top-quality fine cloth was 22.15 yuan, and fine twill was 21 yuan. The current spot price for broker-held goods of Sijunzi serge was only 6 jiao 5 fen per yard, while the future price for next month was 7 jiao 5 fen, attracting many buyers. Therefore, although the market was weak, it was still firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market. Foreign Sugar Falls Again.</h3>
<p>The sugar market continued its downward trend yesterday due to unabated rumors. The public market was marked at 54.5 yuan for 24 coarse white, falling 2.3 yuan. The initial marking for foreign warehouses was 54 yuan, falling to as low as 53 yuan, before recovering slightly to 53.5-4 yuan, resulting in a fall of 2.5 yuan. Transshipment held its original price. Taikoo's B-mark cane white initially ranged from 60 yuan to 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan, and 58.5 yuan, before finally settling at 59 yuan, falling 3 yuan. H-mark cane red was 43 yuan, 42 yuan, and 42.5 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. Dutch red spot was 44 yuan, down 2 yuan, and transshipment was 37 yuan, down 1 yuan. Ben cotton white was down 1.5 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 55 yuan, No. 2 was 54.5 yuan, No. 3 was 54 yuan, and No. 4 was 53.5 yuan. No. 1 rock sugar fell 4 yuan, to 66 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 67.5 yuan. Although the source of domestic sugar was scarce and asking prices remained high, merchants were hesitant to buy due to the high prices and risky market, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>
<h3>Metals. White Lead Sheet Rises to 800 Yuan.</h3>
<p>The main market for white lead sheet has always been battery factories, but construction companies and tea merchants also purchase it in significant quantities. However, merchants from other ports, only Ningbo and Wenfu areas buy a little bit, but only two or three dozen buckets each time. Since the outbreak of the European War, the source of this commodity has been cut off (white lead sheet is produced in Poland and Belgium), and the stock in Shanghai is not abundant. Therefore, those who hold this commodity are becoming firmer in their resolve and are increasing their prices step by step. Currently, the market price is 800 yuan per bucket for No. 2, 780 yuan for No. 3, 770 yuan for No. 4, 760 yuan for No. 5, 750 yuan for No. 6, 740 yuan for Nos. 7 and 8, and 780 yuan for Nos. 9 and 10. The asking price for thick patterned sheets is also around 800 yuan.</p>

<h3>British and Japanese Military Zones. Boundary Changes Scheduled for Tomorrow. Henan Road as the Dividing Line. Municipal Council Issues Official Announcement Yesterday. Japanese Puppets Occupied Yu Yuan Road Li Zhao Fang Again Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Japan's moves regarding the Shanghai International Settlement have been opportunistic and ongoing for some time, only constrained by the complexity of international relations. Since the Jinluoke incident in Western Shanghai on August 19, the Japanese have supported puppet organizations to begin seizing control of the extraterritorial road administration. Following the outbreak of the European War on September 1 and the declaration of war on Germany by Britain and France on September 3, Japanese actions have become even more assertive. On September 6, they demanded that Britain and France withdraw their troops stationed in Shanghai. On September 9, they sent police to invade extraterritorial roads. On September 14, they demanded that commanders of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai adjust their defense zones. Although the details have not been publicly disclosed, the British military zone in the International Settlement is, in fact, one of Japan's goals. For the past week, there have been rumors that the British military zone north of the Suzhou River may be in question. Yesterday, the facts were revealed in two ways: first, a portion of the British military zone north of the Suzhou River will indeed be transferred to the Japanese starting tomorrow, as confirmed by both British and Japanese sides; and second, Japanese and puppet activities in the extraterritorial roads of Western Shanghai have become increasingly blatant. Yesterday, they occupied Li Zhao Fang on Yu Yuan Road again. Although the authorities are unwilling to give up police power, they are helpless against the Japanese and puppet's arrogant actions. In addition to sending more detectives and patrol cars, it seems that they are awaiting a reasonable solution to this case. The situation yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>Defense Zone Change Confirmed</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, starting September 22, the boundary between Zone "A" (Japanese Naval Landing Force Defense Zone) and Zone "B" (British Military Zone) will be changed to North Henan Road, restoring the original boundary from before 1937. North Henan Road will remain within the British Military Zone. The section of land affected by this boundary change is only a small portion, bounded by Baizi Road to the north, North Jiangxi Road to the east, the Suzhou River to the south, and North Henan Road to the west. The barbed wire barricades currently on North Jiangxi Road will remain in place and will not be moved. This boundary change has been agreed upon by the respective naval and military commanders. Pedestrians in the affected area will not need passes and will not be subject to any restrictions. The Municipal Council Police will continue to exercise police power, although Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers may occasionally be seen patrolling the area. It is expected that residents in the area will not experience any inconvenience due to this boundary change and will receive full protection.</p>
<p>British and Japanese Sides</p>
<p>According to a Japanese military spokesman at a reception for Western reporters a few days ago, the area between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road was originally garrisoned by Japanese troops before the war. After the war, the Japanese troops withdrew, and the International Settlement and British troops entered. In June of this year, the Japanese side requested the British military authorities to restore the original pre-war status. After repeated negotiations, both sides reached an agreement on the 11th of this month, stipulating that the British troops would transfer the defense from the 22nd, remove the obstacles at the east end of North Jiangxi Road, and allow the Japanese troops to extend the patrol area to North Henan Road. This is entirely a defense zone issue between the British and Japanese sides and has nothing to do with the plan to adjust the defense zones discussed at the defense meeting convened by the Japanese side in Hongkou on September 14.</p>
<p>Settlement Police Power Exercised As Usual</p>
<p>Well-informed foreign sources stated that recently, the Japanese side requested that the section of the defense zone from Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road be placed under Japanese military jurisdiction. After repeated contacts between the Japanese and British military authorities, an understanding has now been reached. Starting today, the British troops will withdraw from the section, but police power in the section will remain as before. All Municipal Council Police will continue to exercise police power as usual. The obstacles placed by the Japanese side on North Jiangxi Road will also not be moved to North Henan Road. Residents will not need to carry Japanese passes. Therefore, there will be no significant changes in general. However, the Japanese troops will now have the right to patrol the section.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Previously Surveyed the Terrain</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, one British soldier, accompanied by four Japanese officers, traveled in a car and dismounted at the northern end of Tianhougong Bridge to survey the terrain of the eastern section of North Henan Road. In order to understand the actual situation, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency went to inspect the area again at 7 p.m. yesterday and saw that everything was as before. The junctions of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, the end of North Jiangxi Road and Baizi Road, the junction of North Henan Road and Jielu Road, and the junctions of Xizang Road and Haining Road were still blocked by barbed wire, and the British troops had not yet withdrawn. Japanese troops were stationed in the weedy areas northwest of the bridge. The iron shops on the North Suzhou Road between Tianhougong Bridge and Shanxi Road Bridge were busy moving goods the day before yesterday, but there was no such activity yesterday. It is believed that they understood that the Japanese troops currently want to enter the eastern section of North Henan Road.</p>
<p>Not Discussed in the Board of Directors Meeting</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Board of Directors normally adjourns for the summer holidays and has now completed its term. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the first meeting was held. The general opinion was that at this meeting, the authorities would definitely report on and submit for discussion various major issues concerning the current situation of the Settlement, such as the extraterritorial road negotiations and the adjustment of the defense zones of the troops stationed by the various countries. According to the Dazhong News Agency, only two cases were listed on the agenda: (1) A joint letter from six foreign newspapers (including four English newspapers and one Russian and one Japanese newspaper each) to the Municipal Council objecting to the exclusive publication of public documents by the North-China Daily News; (2) A case of selling public land. Issues related to the Settlement were not raised for discussion. (According to the usual practice of the Municipal Council Board of Directors, cases not listed on the agenda are not discussed.)</p>
<p>Detectives and Puppet Police Confront Each Other</p>
<p>In the Caogjiadu area, the puppet police who occupied the positions of the settlement police the day before yesterday to direct traffic have still not withdrawn. However, three Chinese and Indian detectives have been added to each post to stand guard and confront the puppet police, but they are not directing traffic and have not clashed with the puppet police. Yesterday, armored vehicles, patrol cars, and Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives, and mounted patrol teams patrolled back and forth in various places, checking pedestrians non-stop all day.</p>
<p>Li Zhao Fang Almost Experienced a Conflict</p>
<p>Two puppet soldiers are still guarding the front of Si Ming Villa Zhong Shi Xin Cun on Yu Yuan Road. The number of puppet police stationed in Qianjia Lane, opposite Yuguang Village, has been reduced from six to two. Four puppet police have been stationed in front of the workers' dormitory of Feng Tian Textile Mill since the September 18th Incident and have not yet withdrawn. Six puppet police have also been stationed at the Bailinan Road intersection, and the number has now been reduced to two. At 10 a.m. yesterday, a Japanese truck carrying two Japanese military police and six puppet police drove to Li Zhao Fang at No. 909 and suddenly occupied the area, setting up defenses in front of the lane. At that moment, a police armored car carrying more than ten Chinese and Western detectives also arrived at the scene. Seeing the situation, all of them got out of the car with guns and forced the Japanese and puppet police to withdraw. The Japanese and puppet military police also drew their guns and confronted each other. The two sides faced off for a long time, and the situation was serious, almost leading to a conflict. The defense is currently still occupied and guarded by Japanese puppets. Police cars and detectives from the police patrol back and forth on Yu Yuan Road, and the tense situation remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Residents Feel Great Inconvenience Entering and Exiting</p>
<p>Four puppet police at the entrance of Yisheng Kang Ji Timber Yard, next to Qiuyuan at No. 15 Jiesifei'er Road, returned to their posts yesterday after withdrawing on the 11th. Four puppet police who were stationed in front of Sanyi Fang the day before yesterday have also been withdrawn. The number of puppet police in front of the gate of No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road has increased to eight, and the security is stricter than before. Six armed puppet police suddenly went to the Wangjia Longkou entrance (next to Baigong Funeral Home) on Daxilu yesterday and were stationed there. Residents feel uneasy entering and exiting.</p>
<p>Border Inspection of the Settlement is Extremely Strict</p>
<p>The main gate of Lin's Mansion at No. 448 Haige Road has sandbags on each side. Recently, the Japanese puppets removed the sandbags in front of the side gate and piled them in front of the main gate. The project was completed yesterday. The side gate has been sealed since the sandbags were removed. The number of puppet police guarding the gate has also been increased by two, for a total of eight. The firearms are placed flat on the sandbags in a radial pattern. The surrounding situation is very tense. The police armored car and patrol team patrol the area from time to time, and the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles is extremely strict.</p>
<h3>Shipping Costs Between Shanghai and Europe and America Soar. Increase of 50 Percent to the Americas. Increase of 20 Percent to Europe and America. No Responsibility for Accidents En Route.</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the shipping industry of the belligerent countries has been greatly affected. Some regular liners have been ordered to suspend sailings. Although non-scheduled ships are still operating, their schedules are kept secret. Although ships from neutral countries can still sail normally, they are operating at risk. Therefore, the shipping cost from Shanghai to the Americas has increased by 50 percent, and the cost from Shanghai to Europe has increased by 20 percent. Shipping companies are not responsible for accidents en route. Yesterday, the Dutch Java Mail Line also notified passengers that it would not be responsible for accidents involving goods loaded on its ships during the European War.</p>
<h3>North and South Ocean British Ship Sailing: Strict Secrecy of Voyage; Italian Speculation Still on Europe-Asia Route: Whether Key Points Can Be Reached Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the European war, commercial vessels of various countries were temporarily suspended. Subsequently, armed vessels were ordered to resume sailing. Neutral vessels of other countries also continued to operate as usual on the North and South Pacific and North American routes. However, those heading to Europe rarely departed on schedule. In order to avoid damage from enemy submarines and to ensure the safety of travelers, all vessels of belligerent nations and those closely related to them have suspended voyages or shortened routes. A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from the China Travel Service yesterday that the Italian Postal Shipping Company's Conte Biancamano postal ship, originally scheduled to depart for Europe on the 14th of this month, was delayed in Shanghai due to some reason. Now, due to excessive cargo accumulation, the ship has been rescheduled to depart from Shanghai Customs for Europe on the 24th of this month. Passenger ticket procedures have already begun. Whether it will be able to reach its final destination on the European route is still difficult to predict. It is heard that many people have contacted to board the ship to the South Seas recently, but very few are going to Europe. The ship arrived in Shanghai on the 12th and, after unloading passengers and cargo, sailed to Wusong to anchor. It is scheduled to return to the Jardine Matheson Wharf at 7:00 am this morning to load export goods.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Shipping Diminished</p>
<p>British commercial vessels sailing along the coastal ports of China were once ordered to cease operations, but soon resumed sailing. However, ship imports are kept strictly secret, and exports are also difficult to accurately determine. As for the North China route, Jardine Matheson's ships continue to operate as usual, but Taikoo's liner services have been greatly reduced. The reason for this is that the company does not have formal warehouses, so local miscellaneous grains are not loaded onto Taikoo's ships. The company's cargo transportation on the South China route is slightly better than on the North China route, but it is also slightly affected because freight charges are settled in Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Irregular Ships Fully Loaded with Passengers and Cargo</p>
<p>As for irregular vessels, they are still calculated in national currency, resulting in a threefold profit. Recently, Qia Cheng Company has managed the Norwegian commercial vessel "Guardian Beck," weighing 3,000 tons, which is scheduled to sail directly to Hong Kong on the 24th, arriving in three days. Cargo delivery is convenient for the local people. Furthermore, the "Yong Zhen" vessel, jointly managed by Tong Shun and Zhong Wei Companies, has also been approved to sail to Hong Kong on the 24th, and also to Haiphong. It is reported that both ships are fully loaded with passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>After Consideration, German Ships Sail to Zhenhai</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the German North German Lloyd and Hamburg America Line shipping companies have suspended all vessels operating on Far East routes. However, German ships operating along the coastal ports of China have been ordered to stop sailing beyond three kilometers from Chinese territorial waters. Now, German ships operating in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River continue to operate as usual because they are within Chinese territorial waters. However, regarding the sailing of ships to Zhenhai, after consideration by various companies, "Falcon" sailed to Zhenhai yesterday, and "Hana" is scheduled to sail to Zhenhai today.</p>
<p>Xiangtai Arrives in Shanghai; Shenyou Anchors in Wenzhou</p>
<p>After the Japanese navy declared that it would blockade Wenzhou Bay from the evening of the 17th, the British Yi Long Company's "Shenyou" vessel still sailed to Wenzhou on the 18th. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the shipowner stating that it had safely arrived at the mouth of the Ou River. The telegram did not mention when it would enter the port. The British "New Xiangtai" vessel, represented by Taichangxiang Company, left Wenzhou for Shanghai on the morning of the 18th and safely arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying charcoal, local paper, and passengers. However, it has not yet been decided whether it will sail to Wenzhou again in the future, as navigation is quite dangerous after Japanese warships laid mines outside the mouth of Wenzhou. The British "Yongtai" vessel, which originally planned to sail to Wenzhou, has also changed its route to Zhenhai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Post Office: Strictly Prohibiting Letter Carriers from Demanding Tips</h3>
<p>Shanghai Post Office News: The Post Office strictly prohibits letter carriers from demanding alcohol money or holiday rewards. If such incidents occur, people can firmly refuse them and immediately report the situation and the uniform number of the letter carrier to the Post Office for disciplinary action.</p>
<h3>American Transportation Company Takes on Huge Responsibility: Reorganizing Highway System; Engaging in Adjusting Southwest Highway Transportation; Funding from US-China Loan; "Jixing" Has Already Reached Agreement with the Chinese Side</h3>
<p>Mainland News reports that, according to the Chicago Daily Tribune, an American truck driver who struggled from nothing and became wealthy in the American transportation industry will personally take responsibility for reorganizing China's highway system. The driver's name is Jixing, who is the chairman of the Chicago Jixing Transcontinental Trucking Company.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process: Mr. Chen, the director of the Chinese government's trade agency in the United States, reached an agreement with Jixing Company in August. The funding for this project will be allocated from the $25 million loan extended to China by the Export-Import Bank of the United States last December. Jixing, who is responsible for reorganizing transportation on the Burma Road and the Haiphong-Chongqing Road, first sent Xue Heng and two other members of the company to China at the end of August. It is said that Jixing Company's services were introduced by the U.S. government, but Mr. Chen has denied this, saying that he engaged Jixing due to business relations.</p>
<p>Main Tasks: Jixing's main task is to accelerate transportation on the two highways from Burma and Vietnam to Chongqing. Another part of the work is to coordinate transportation between the highways and the railways still under the control of the central government. A serious problem that Jixing and others will encounter is how to utilize the empty trucks returning from Chongqing to coastal locations to transport tung oil and other export products. It is said that the current transportation system is time-consuming and costly.</p>
<p>Ordering Trucks: China recently purchased 3,000 trucks from the United States, and another 2,000 are under negotiation. Most of the trucks that have already been shipped have arrived in Haiphong and Yangon. The companies that supplied these trucks include Chrysler, General Motors, and others. Mr. Rein, the vice chairman of Global Trading Company, which purchased the trucks for China, stated that these trucks will be used to transport all kinds of goods in and out of China. Most of the commerce is routed through the highway to Yangon. Although there has been heavy rain recently, the road conditions are good. The highway to Haiphong is also not affected by the rain.</p>
<h3>US Mine-Laying Ship Comes to Shanghai from Qingdao</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that the U.S. Asian Fleet's mine-laying ship "Finch," which usually berths in Qingdao during the summer, has set anchor and is coming to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive around noon tomorrow (the 21st). The duration of the ship's stay in Shanghai is unknown, but it is expected to be short, and it will soon sail to the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Britain and France Have No Time to Attend to the East; Japan Carries Out New Conspiracy: Eager to End the War with China; Obtain Britain's and France's Interests in the Far East; However, Anxious About the United States</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that, according to unofficial Japanese sources in this city, influential political circles in Japan believe that the militaristic officers of the Japanese Navy are currently actively engaged in forming a five-nation alliance between the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan, and China. Proponents of this new diplomatic policy in Japan claim that this alliance would be most beneficial to Japan.</p>
<p>Attempting to End the War and Trying to Advance Southward</p>
<p>Because it can simultaneously solve Japan's two major problems: (1) To gradually cease hostilities with China, ending a war that has lasted far longer than Japan initially expected; (2) Japan would be in a position to prevent the United States from assisting Britain and France and participating in the European war, and could begin naval operations, resulting in Japan being able to occupy Hong Kong, French Vietnam, and even the rich Dutch East Indies. In other words, with Britain and France preoccupied in Europe, Japan will be able to seize Britain's and France's interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>Will Make Further Concessions on Conditions to China</p>
<p>It is said that Japanese political circles who support this new action are even prepared to cease hostilities with China on conditions that are much more moderate than previously demanded. They believe that once Japan seizes Britain's and France's interests in the Far East, its position will be such that it can demand even harsher conditions from China later. Japanese political circles also claim that even if China refuses to join the alliance and prefers to continue the war of resistance, the Japanese government will still be able to proceed with its new policy, although it will be hampered by having to station a large army on the Chinese front.</p>
<p>Rumors for Days Must Have a Reason</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources in this city, the agreement reached in Moscow on a Soviet-Japanese truce, ending hostilities in the "Manchukuo-Mongolia" border area, is only a preliminary step towards this goal. Now that there is a possibility of concluding a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan, Japan is now engaging in efforts to make peace with China, so that the realization of the five-nation alliance plan is closer. The rumor that former Prime Minister Konoe announced five peace conditions while in office is now in contact with Chinese government leaders in Hong Kong, and the rumor that Song Ziwen, one of the Chinese government leaders supported by the Chinese Communist Party, has flown to Moscow. Although Chongqing has denied it, observers believe that there must be some reason for the spread of these rumors, which are related to these developments.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the National Government's Request for a Truce</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei recently sent another telegram to Generalissimo Chiang and other leaders of the Chinese government, calling for peace. A prominent feature of his telegram is that he no longer criticizes the Communist Party in Chongqing, whom Wang used to accuse of "protecting and coercing" Generalissimo Chiang. At the same time, Japan's "New Declaration" republished an editorial advocating peace between China and Japan. Some sources claim that Japan, or at least a portion of the influential leaders in Japanese politics, the military, and the navy, are eager to stop the war in China in order to embark on new ventures that are more profitable. Japan will re-recognize the Chongqing government in exchange for a truce and alliance, but will insist on Wang Jingwei's reinstatement.</p>
<p>Chongqing Has Not Yet Made a Definite Statement</p>
<p>Japan will also agree to withdraw Japanese troops from China, except for stationing several divisions in major cities, and to at least temporarily accept the "economic cooperation" advocated by the Chongqing leaders, rather than the economic domination previously sought by Japan. However, the exact terms of peace have not yet been formulated. Chongqing's response to the rumored Japanese proposal is still unknown. However, it is certain that any contact between Tokyo and Chongqing is still in its early stages. It is heard that a portion of Japanese leaders oppose this radical new policy, fearing that it will lead to a direct conflict with the U.S. government, and the U.S. fleet is still stationed in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Cost of Living Continues to Increase; Public Works Department Continues to Add Subsidies: From 25% to 40%; Approved by the Board of Directors; Effective from October; - Annual Cost Approximately 750,000 Yuan -</h3>
<p>In June of this year, the Public Works Department's Board of Directors approved an increase in temporary cost-of-living subsidies for employees, and resolved that this subsidy would be re-reviewed by the end of September, depending on the situation. Due to the further contraction of foreign exchange and the increase in the cost of living,</p>
<p>The Department's Selection Committee met on the 11th of this month and resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve an increase in the amount of subsidies for all employees holding contracts from October 1st of this year, from 25% to 40%. This subsidy is for "B" and "L" grade employees,</p>
<p>Paid according to the full amount of their salaries; "A" grade employees, paid according to two-thirds of their salaries; Chinese employees who do not hold contracts, their subsidies increased from 20% (minimum of 4 yuan) to 30% (minimum of 6 yuan). The committee also resolved that "A" grade employees should receive</p>
<p>Exchange subsidies for one-third of their salaries. In view of the Department's financial situation, it is proposed that the original standard be maintained, that is, one Zhou coin is equivalent to six pence in English currency, and not based on the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate limit is changed to four pence, the annual subsidy calculated at this exchange rate will require</p>
<p>753,000 yuan. According to the method proposed by the Selection Committee above, the total amount of subsidies for all employees is as follows: "A grade employees" 186,000 yuan, "B" and "L" grade employees 753,000 yuan, Chinese employees who do not hold contracts 478,000 yuan, totaling 1,417,000 yuan. The above recommendations have been approved by the Public Works Department's Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Recall of Tram Ticket Vouchers; Extended; 3-Cent Voucher Extended for Use for One Month</h3>
<p>Shanghai Tramway Company's voucher, the amount of which is three cents, has been printed in three types, June, July, and August 1939. The company originally stipulated that the above voucher could be used until yesterday in order to prevent forgery. It could not be used from today onwards. Because this voucher has been used as a substitute for money in the market for a long time, it has been rejected by everyone since the company issued the previous announcement. However, according to the Datong News Agency reporter who inquired this morning, the tram company has extended the 3-cent voucher for one month, allowing it to be used until October 20th. Therefore, the voucher will definitely continue to circulate in the market, slightly alleviating the need for the extended issuance of small coins.</p>
<p>Tobacco and Money Exchange Industries: The money exchange and tobacco industries associations in this city, due to a lack of subsidiary currency and difficulties in making change, have issued various vouchers to meet the current urgent needs. Recently, it was discovered that counterfeit vouchers were being mixed in everywhere, which was very harmful to the common people. Furthermore, since the Central Bank will be issuing new coins soon, the difficulty in making change can be expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>Exchange and Recall: Therefore, they have separately implemented the exchange and recall of the originally issued vouchers in full, and have unanimously stopped issuing new vouchers. Furthermore, according to rumors in the two industries, the Central Bank has shipped 200,000 yuan of new subsidiary currency coins from Hong Kong, which remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>No. 17 Pu Shi Village Searched Yesterday</h3>
<p>One Wireless Machine Found; And a Mr. Xu Arrested</p>
<p>At 2:00 AM yesterday, French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to search the house at No. 17 Pu Shi Village, Pu Shi Road. A wireless telegraph machine was found on the spot, said to be worth more than a thousand dollars, and five young women in the house were arrested. Subsequently, a Mr. Xu was arrested at Siming Village, Fuxu Road, and taken back to the police station for investigation. It is said that Mr. Xu is a supervisor assigned by the Central Ministry of Finance to the Shanghai Gold Exchange. As for the wireless telegraph machine, the police reported that it was confiscated because it had not been registered in advance. The five women who were arrested were released after questioning.</p>
<h3>US Naval Commander Hurlbut Will Come to Shanghai Again: Scheduled to Come to Shanghai at the End of the Month to Contact Various Parties; Trip to Qingdao Due to Official Business</h3>
<p>Admiral Hurlbut, Commander of the U.S. Asian Fleet, hurriedly came to Shanghai from Qingdao last Thursday because the Japanese convened a meeting of defense forces from various countries in Shanghai. He then visited U.S. Consul Gauss to discuss the defense force meeting. Although the specifics of the discussion have not been disclosed, many believe that the U.S. interests in Shanghai need Admiral Hurlbut's opinions. It is now known that Admiral Hurlbut has unfinished business in North China related to his Shanghai trip, so he left Shanghai on the private yacht "Isabelle" at 3:00 PM on the 19th and sailed to Qingdao. Before leaving, Admiral Hurlbut revealed that his mission in Shanghai was not completed and that he would stay in Qingdao for a week and then take the flagship "Augusta" back to Shanghai at the end of September. At that time, Admiral Hurlbut hopes to stay in Shanghai for a longer period to observe the development of the situation in Shanghai and maintain contact with various parties.</p>
<h3>First Cheap Rice Distribution Point Cancelled; Pingyao Ends This Week; Points One and Two Merged and Open as Usual; A Coolie Died of Heatstroke at Point Four</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the first cheap rice distribution. The entrances to the five distribution points were still crowded with people, but the order was good. Each district from one to four sold 200 bags, while district five sold 250 bags. Rice prices continued to fall due to the cheap rice distribution. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Change of Location: Point One opened at 7:00 AM and finished selling at 12:00 PM. However, because the location was close to Zhabei and there were concerns about accidents, it was announced that it would be merged with Point Two starting today. The original announcement is as follows: "Because the location of the first cheap rice distribution point is close to Zhabei and there is nothing to block the surroundings, and the number of rice buyers is too large and crowded, it is easy for accidents to occur. Therefore, it has been decided to merge the first cheap rice distribution point with the second cheap rice distribution point at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Carter Road, starting tomorrow (the 21st), and to continue the cheap rice distribution as usual. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Generous Contribution: The order at Point Two was good throughout the day. After stopping sales at 3:00 PM, thousands of civilians were still standing and waiting, reluctant to leave. The director of the district, at the suggestion of a Western police officer, issued each person a piece of paper (stamped with the seal of the Rice Industry Association's Second Cheap Rice Distribution Point) so that they could buy tickets first tomorrow. Point Three opened at 8:00 AM and finished selling at 1:00 PM. In order to prevent overcrowding, Chinese and Western police officers used long ropes to block off the area north of Rue du Consulat and Gordon Road, and rice buyers entered in an orderly fashion. The order was good. Seeing the crowded situation, the distribution may be increased by 100 bags tomorrow. At 9:00 AM yesterday, two young women went to the site to observe and were moved by the plight of the civilians scrambling to buy rice. They volunteered to donate 35 yuan to help with the purchase of tickets. A staff member at the site also donated 67 two-sheng rice tickets, worth 26.8 yuan. Their courage and willingness to help is commendable.</p>
<p>Death from Heatstroke: Point Four finished selling at 2:30 PM. The police officers still used long ropes to block off both ends of West Gate Road (Avenue des Soeurs and Rue Luber) for rice buyers to enter and exit, so the order was also good. Point Five opened at 8:00 AM and finished selling at 6:00 PM. However, the weather was hot yesterday afternoon, and the civilians were crowded. At 3:20 PM, a middle-aged man suddenly collapsed from heatstroke in front of the Danjing Temple. A reporter from the Datong News Agency was inspecting the site and saw an ambulance arrive and take the man to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The reporter followed to the hospital and carried him to the emergency room, but he had already died. He was wearing dark blue shorts, barefoot, bald, wearing black cloth shoes, his chest open, and his face dark. A flour bag for buying rice was left beside him, but no banknotes were found. At 3:50 PM, the reporter left the hospital and saw that the French police had sent officers to the scene and then sent the body to the morgue. The man's name is unknown.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Continue to Fall: Yesterday, the owners registered 3,884 bags of rice for sale at the Rice Market Management Committee. Because the arrival of goods was very large, prices continued to fall. Transactions were mostly for indica rice, because middle-class families are using indica rice instead of japonica rice. According to people at the market, the arrival of goods from various places is increasing, and rice prices are expected to continue to weaken.</p>
<p>Ends This Week: According to information obtained by a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, yesterday was the fourth day of the cheap rice distribution. The large ones have already sold 4,000 bags, calculated at an average of 1,000 bags sold each day. There are still 4,000 bags remaining, which will be sold out this week. The distribution will be announced to end by Saturday of this week. Therefore, each district will issue an additional 100 bags starting today to sell as much as possible. As for whether to continue with a second cheap rice distribution, the various groups have not yet considered it and will need to discuss it before making a decision.</p>
<h3>City Federation Studies How to Raise Funds for Education at the Theatre</h3>

<h3>Australian Tycoon Broadcasts Tonight: Describes Transformation from Personal Reform to Social Reform</h3>
<p>Mr. Robb Coldhbeck, an Englishman, grew up in Australia. He was good at doing business and accumulated a lot of wealth, so he lived a romantic life and indulged in drinking and lust. His wife finally couldn't bear it anymore and was about to file for divorce. At this point, Mr. Robb also regretted it very much, but he couldn't change his bad habits and couldn't get out of it. One day, he accidentally turned on the radio for entertainment and heard a famous artist describe his transformation process. His absurd situation was exactly the same. Later, he found a "solution," which was to hand himself over to God's management. He immediately gained the ability to correct his mistakes and help others reform. Mr. Robb was greatly moved and humbly appealed to God, willing to be managed. From then on, he completely cleared away the bad habits he had been fighting for more than 20 years. His wife and children also began a new life together. Later, he spoke in the Australian Parliament, and leaders from political and business circles were reformed, affecting the entire Australia. Mr. Robb recently went to the United States to attend the World Conference on Moral Rearmament. The day before yesterday, he came to Shanghai with the Chinese delegation and is currently staying at Room 613 of the International Hotel. Those who wish to meet him are welcome and he will be happy to entertain them. He is scheduled to broadcast his experience at 8:30 tonight (Thursday) on 760 kHz and contribute it to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Kidnapping Case on Tianjin Road; Fortunately Rescued by Rickshaw Pullers; Two Japanese Tied Up a Mr. Wang; Dozens of Rickshaw Pullers Rescued Him</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reports that the police department was investigating two Japanese and a Chinese man last night because the three men tied up another Chinese man in front of No. 405 Tianjin Road yesterday afternoon. A Mr. Wang, the owner of a coal shop on Liaozhou Road, took a rickshaw to the Coal Merchants Association office at No. 405 Tianjin Road yesterday afternoon. As soon as he stepped out of the rickshaw, two Japanese and a Chinese man stood in front of him and asked Mr. Wang his name and occupation. At that time, there was a taxi waiting next to the three men. Mr. Wang immediately explained that he was going to the</p>
<p>Coal Merchants Association in the building, but the three men insisted that Wang's last name was another one, and that entering the building was not to go to the Coal Merchants Association, but to engage in other activities. Mr. Wang repeatedly stated that he was indeed a coal merchant. As a result of the argument, the two Japanese and the Chinese man grabbed Mr. Wang and tried to drag him into the taxi. Mr. Wang resisted, but seemed no match for the three men. At that moment, an unexpected thing happened. Twenty or thirty rickshaw pullers, who were paying attention to their dispute from a distance, rushed forward and grabbed Mr. Wang. Both sides</p>
<p>As a result of the struggle, Mr. Wang was finally left on the sidewalk. The rickshaw pullers surrounded him, while the two Japanese hurriedly got into the taxi, which was driven away by the Chinese man who was with them. According to the judgment obtained by the detectives investigating this matter last night, the two Japanese mistakenly identified the coal merchant as another Chinese man, but the two were extremely similar. The investigation is underway and is expected to uncover an interesting conspiracy.</p>
<h3>Pig Slaughtering Dispute</h3>
<p>The pig slaughtering workers at the French Concession slaughterhouse and the butchers have been disputing over increasing the slaughtering fee, restoring the method of dividing the seven offal parts (i.e., cutting off the small intestine, tail tip, heart lining fat, etc.), and the issue of not being responsible for sick, paralyzed, or dead pigs. Both sides threatened to suspend operations. The director of the Public Works Department convened an arbitration and ruled that the slaughtering fee be increased to 1.5 yuan. An agreement was reached on the 18th of this month. However, because it was not followed on time, the offal parts were cut off uniformly that night. The situation has become quite serious, and meat eaters will be panicked.</p>
<h3>Housing Dispute in Qingyu Lane: Eviction Deadline Yesterday; Tenants Still Find Eviction Difficult; Request to Add Rent for Continued Residence</h3>
<p>The tenants in Qingyu Lane on New Chongqing Road in this city have been in a lawsuit with the Shanghai Women's Bank, which leased the lane and plans to renovate the houses, for many years. The Women's Bank won the case after three trials on March 31st of this year, and the tenants were ordered to move out before April 15th of this year. Later, because the tenants had difficulty finding houses, they did not move out, which led to tragedies such as fights and water cuts in May. On July 9th, after mediation by all parties, both sides agreed to extend the deadline to September 20th. Yesterday was the deadline for eviction, but the tenants still showed no signs of moving out. According to the tenants, we are willing to increase the rent appropriately, but eviction is really difficult. It is heard that several families who originally planned to move to the cross-border area have now temporarily given up. On the part of the Women's Bank, it has repeatedly extended the eviction deadline and has also expressed understanding for the tenants.</p>

<h3>Lewd Monk Appeals Ten Thousand Yuan Case, Suddenly Withdraws Before Judgment; Civil Lawsuit Opens Yesterday for Discussion of Postponement and Further Verification; Sun Lanzhen Sentenced to Three Months' Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</h3>
<p>Previously, during the warlord era, Yang Sunshi, the beloved concubine of Yang Yunwu, a native of Gaoyou who successively served as county magistrate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces, namely Sun Lanzhen, was seduced and raped by Wan Yuan (lay name Tong Changyao), the former abbot monk of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple. She was instigated to abscond with a huge sum of gold jewelry on May 28 of this year. After Yang discovered this, he reported the matter to the police, who first arrested Wan Yuan, confiscated the stolen goods pillowcase, and sent them to the Special No. 2 Court, where he was prosecuted for receiving stolen goods. The result was a sentence of</p>
<p>Six months' imprisonment, with Yang Yunwu's attached civil lawsuit for 6,690 yuan and 550 yuan in losses, transferred to the Civil Court for trial. Subsequently, the police arrested Sun Lanzhen and sent her to the Special No. 2 Court, where she was prosecuted for theft. According to her confession, she completely believed Wan Yuan's instigation to abscond, and all the huge sums of money and three pairs of gold bracelets she took away were handed over to Wan Yuan, with herself only using 200 yuan. She was ordered to post bail and reschedule the trial. Wan Yuan, dissatisfied with the initial trial judgment, commissioned lawyer Xu Wufangjin as his agent to the High Third Branch Court</p>
<p>He filed an appeal. The joint collegiate panel of the High Third Branch Court summoned Sun Lanzhen for questioning some days ago. After the trial concluded, the verdict was scheduled to be announced yesterday afternoon. Regarding Sun Lanzhen, namely Yang Sunshi's theft case, was tried yesterday morning by Judge Qiu of the Special No. 2 Court. The court ruled that she be sentenced to three months' imprisonment, suspended for two years. As for the attached civil lawsuit filed by Yang Yunwu against Wan Yuan, it was transferred from the Criminal Court to the Civil Court for handling. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu Changzi opened the Civil</p>
<p>Seventh Court to hear the case. The plaintiff Yang Yunwu, accompanied by representative lawyer Liu Xiang, appeared in court and recounted the previous events. The defendant Wan Yuan was brought to court from the detention center and vehemently denied instigating Sunshi to abscond, evasively shifting blame. The court, due to the criminal appeal verdict not yet being final, decided to postpone the hearing. The defendant was returned to custody. Wan Yuan, knowing that the whole truth had been revealed by Sunshi's confession and that the appeal was unreasonable, immediately submitted a statement to the High Third Branch Court after the conclusion of the debate, requesting</p>
<p>To withdraw the appeal. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Court President Wu Tingqi of the High Third Branch Court, accompanied by Judges Chen and Wang, opened the court and brought Wan Yuan to the court. He asked, "Do you request to withdraw the appeal?" The answer was yes. The court ordered, "Since the appeal was withdrawn before the judgment, it is hereby approved. He is to be returned to custody to await execution."</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Sentenced</h3>
<p>Cai Jingji and Chai Yanqing, who dealt in woolen yarn, each carrying 3,000 yuan in legal tender, intended to go to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. on the Bund to purchase woolen yarn at 1:45 PM on the 29th of last month. As they passed Sichuan Road, several robbers suddenly stepped forward to rob them. Cai and others resisted, and one of the robbers immediately drew a pistol and fired at Cai, hitting Cai in the shoulder. At that time, nearby detectives heard the alarm and surrounded the area to arrest the perpetrators. Two thieves, Wang Arong from Hangzhou and Shen Guilin from Pudong, were arrested, and a pistol and three bullets were confiscated. They were taken to the General Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Chief Fan Defu and Detective Zhu Zixiang, the facts were confirmed. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a public prosecution with the Special No. 1 Court on charges of attempted murder and robbery. The trial has been concluded, and yesterday morning, Criminal Court President Qian Hongye announced the judgment: Wang Arong was sentenced to nine years and six months' imprisonment, and Shen Guilin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The confiscated pistol and bullets were all confiscated.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Yang Yiming Assaults Someone; Store Association Provides Proof; Witnesses See Yang Beating Old Woman</h3>
<p>Young lawyer Yang Yiming, residing at No. 33 Qiyicun, Xujiahui West Street, was reported to the police for allegedly assaulting Song Wangshi (50 years old), a woman from Songjiang, and a request was made for punishment. The Special No. 1 Court had already held a trial once, and the police requested a postponement for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu held another trial. The victim, Song Wangshi, firmly stated that on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, she went to the defendant's house to look for her daughter-in-law, Song Zhang Hongshi, and saw the defendant and her daughter-in-law lying in bed chatting. She broke into the bedroom and scolded her daughter-in-law, and was dragged out of the door and beaten by the defendant. The court questioned the defendant, Yang Yipeng, based on this, but he vehemently denied it. Judge Qiu then presented the joint public statement from more than 30 shops and residents of Qiyicun, witnessing Yang's assault, to Yang for his inspection. Yang Yiming then stated to the court that since the shops and residents had witnessed the assault, he requested the court to summon them to court for cross-examination. Judge Qiu reviewed the case and decided to postpone the trial for further deliberation.</p>
<h3>Pushing Daughter into River, Drowning Her</h3>
<p>Shen Jinfa, a native of Peidong, 33 years old this year, owned a barge. His deceased former wife had a daughter named Shen Qiuqin, 11 years old this year. Shen also entered into a matrilocal marriage with Shen Li (52 years old this year), a fellow villager and colleague. He, his former wife's daughter, and his current wife, his mother-in-law, lived together on the boat. On the 19th of this month, the boat was anchored in the old port of Suzhou Creek. At 10:00 PM that night, Shen Jinfa pushed his daughter Qiuqin into the water due to an argument with his step-mother-in-law Shen Li. The tide was strong at the time, making rescue impossible, resulting in the daughter drowning. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the girl's body floated up in the Wusong Wharf of Suzhou Creek. Shen Li reported this to the Jianghai Customs Yong Police Station, and Shen Jinfa was arrested and transferred to the French Police Station for investigation. Meanwhile, the body was retrieved and sent to the Tongren Funeral Home for preservation, pending a report to the Special No. 2 Court to send personnel for inspection.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Performing Arts Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Performing Arts Association was organized for the purpose of mutual assistance among enthusiastic members of the performing arts community and to promote art. Yu Qiaqing was hired as honorary president, Lin Kanghou and Yuan Ludeng as honorary vice presidents, and Kai Bangjun as honorary chairman of the board. Zhang Zhier, Liu Ziyun, Huang Zhaolin, Li Zhuan, Dong Tianmin and fifteen others were designated as directors. Recognizing the suffering of colleagues due to birth, aging, illness, and death, with no one to care for them, and the hardship of colleagues’ children without access to school, a relief group was specially established to secure colleagues’ welfare and operational security. For example, the 040 Stomach Pain Medicine Tablet Factory suddenly stopped broadcasting programmes due to raw material shortages, violating the contract, resulting in material and powder issues. The association has been entrusted by the various performing artists to mediate this matter. However, as the association is newly established, funds are limited. Therefore, in accordance with the association's charter, major factories and companies are being sought to serve as sponsoring members, paying an annual sponsorship fee of 120 yuan. In return, the association has established mandatory publicity methods to repay them. It is reported that dozens of companies, including Chinese and Western pharmacies and Xinhua Film Company, have already joined, which is quite enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Shenchang Foreign Firm Warehouse; Bold Thieves Carry Away Iron Moulds; Detectives Guard Dock and Search; Stolen Ship Discovers Dock and Flees</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 AM on the 17th of this month, a large gang of thieves, numbering more than thirty, suddenly arrived at the Zhabei Shenchang Foreign Firm warehouse. Among them, two thieves each held a new-style box cannon, and one thief held a rifle. They broke down the door and used violent means to scare and silence the four Russian inspectors hired in the warehouse, tying them with ropes.</p>
<p>The remaining thieves began robbing under surveillance. However, there were no goods in the warehouse, only heavy ironware. The group seemed to have a pre-determined plan, having hired a boat to wait in advance. They managed to transport the iron moulds, worth more than 20,000 yuan, to the boat, and then they howled as they boarded the boat and sailed away. The incident was learned by Chinese detective Yao Changmin and detective Xia Yexian of the Jing'an Temple Police Station.</p>
<p>Other accomplices were waiting at the Xiaoshadu Road dock for the goods to be transported to the dock, where they would help unload them and then find a way to sell them. The detectives and Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the Xiaoshadu Road dock to lie in wait. Before long, they saw the stolen boat coming. Unexpectedly, the thieves on the boat had also discovered the detectives lying in ambush on the shore, so with a shout, they turned the boat around and fled downstream. At the same time, they threw the iron moulds on the boat into the river. By the time the detectives notified the authorities in the northern district</p>
<p>And coordinated the pursuit, the stolen boat had disappeared. Only five suspects from Jiangbei, Xun Jishan, Song Ada, Li Tongyu, Li Tongfen, and Shen Zhigao, were arrested on the dock and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Second Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang recounted the facts of the case and requested that the suspects be detained for investigation. The judge ordered approval and ordered detention for seven days for further verification.</p>

<h3>Casual Understanding of Reading (1)</h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Zhonghe in the Tang Dynasty, Huang Chao was annihilated. When Huang Chao's head was presented to the emperor, a group of noble women who had surrendered to the "bandits" were also brought in. The emperor asked, "You have all received the grace of the royal family. Why did you surrender to the bandits?" The leading female prisoner replied, "The country has a million people and still loses ground and moves the capital. Your Majesty blames a few women for not resisting. Aren't the civil and military officials ashamed?" As a result, the emperor asked no more questions and simply shouted, "Drag them down and behead them!"</p>
<p>This story was able to circulate, thanks to Sima Guang: he wrote it in the "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government." Zhou Hui, in the "Qingbo Magazine," specially praised this woman who had given the emperor a setback, saying that it was a shame that such a person was not written into the "Biographies of Virtuous Women," causing her name to be forgotten. - This insight, in my opinion, is "unique" among the ancient Chinese.</p>
<p>But the emperor mentioned here is Emperor Xizong of Tang. In the "Unofficial History of the Nanzhao" I read about another matter involving this emperor and a woman.</p>
<p>In the same year that Huang Chao was "painfully annihilated" by Li Keyong (the third year of Zhonghe), because Nanzhao (i.e., Yunnan) was strong and tough, the emperor felt that it was somewhat difficult to deal with, so he sent a princess of the imperial family to the king of Nanzhao, Longshun. This calculation was not wrong. Nanzhao really sent the most important ministers to negotiate with the Tang Dynasty. So three came, and he poisoned three of them. It's just a pity that Li Keyong rebelled again not long after, and this grand plan was never able to develop. I think that princess probably repaid the "grace of the royal family."</p>
<p>Chinese writers have always been unwilling to talk about other people's shortcomings, saying it is "preserving the way of loyalty and generosity." But this "loyalty and generosity" often turns into hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Wu Dexuan's "The First Moon Tower Records" is a book recording figures since the Ming and Qing dynasties, which is a great contribution to historical anecdotes. However, reading it from beginning to end raises a question. That question is: how can the people he "heard" and "saw" all be so talented and moral? Because in fact, it is really not seen that there are "good people" everywhere. Therefore, in my opinion, Wu Dexuan's work is at least partially untrue.</p>
<p>And to conceal something for a person, one must use one's own moral standards as the standard, which often precisely conceals a person's strengths. For example, the entry on Xu Juyuan in "The First Moon Tower Records" makes such a mistake.</p>
<p>According to the record there, Xu Juyuan was simply capable of writing articles, lived in seclusion in the mountains, vowed not to surrender to the Qing, and was burned to death by robbers, and that was all. But Xu Juyuan had another moving story: he once participated in the rebellious peasant army, and at that time he himself was called a "robber." In my opinion, since he was able to vow not to surrender to the Qing, his being a "robber" must have had something to do with "anti-Qing." Now we know very little about his deeds. Given Wu Dexuan's era and "hearing," he should have known, but he made his deeds disappear in order to conceal them.</p>
<h3>Morning Glory House (Note)</h3>
<p>— Tang Wei</p>
<p>—Memories of Rubble—</p>
<p>Under the Rainbow Bridge, after a stretch of dimly lit streets.</p>
<p>Not very respectable doors, with a few not very respectable enamel signs nailed to them; from the outside, this looks neither like an institution nor like a private residence.</p>
<p>"It's here!"</p>
<p>The old buddy who came with me, pushes open the door, and the swirling lights leak out, adding a touch of mysterious temptation to the hearts of the guests.</p>
<p>In a luxurious - but not spacious - living room, several guests of different styles are already seated.</p>
<p>"When did you come back?"</p>
<p>Qun is my only acquaintance, he comes up to grab my right hand.</p>
<p>"This morning."</p>
<p>The unfamiliar friends stare at us like wooden chickens.</p>
<p>After a while.</p>
<p>"Is it Old Tang?" the host asks the old buddy modestly:</p>
<p>He is a complete gentleman in the Harbin style, with a long-collared pointed shirt and a wide-headed tie; a pair of goldfish eyes flutter with watery light in the diamond-shaped glasses.</p>
<p>"Ah, let me introduce everyone! Old Tang, ... our boss and Morning Glory House owner, Rong Qiu; great poet Qiaofu, Old Wang, theorist Shiyu, silly brother Old Meng, Rong Qiu's wife, Qun doesn't need me to introduce him;" the old buddy points his thumb on his chest and says, "Old hen artist Old Chong is being introduced!"</p>
<p>Everyone who was introduced smiles apologetically and mischievously.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, everyone becomes intimate with each other, talking endlessly and randomly.</p>
<p>The old buddy clings to a female teacher who comes later, he keeps calling her "Dry Sister," which sounds very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Rong Qiu is always smiling insincerely, but not without gentlemanly demeanor. - He kindly entertained me that evening.</p>
<p>The friends I met here, each gave me a deep impression; I don't like them fooling around in serious environments; but I cherish their enthusiasm in a cold atmosphere.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye.</p>
<p>Seeing that the walls all around are newly dead rice seedlings, I firmly believe that this is the reason for the name "Morning Glory House."</p>
<p>Note: The Morning Glory House was a literary group with a relatively good reputation in the Northeast around the "September 18th" Incident. It disappeared five years ago. Few of the friends who used to gather together are still alive today, except for a few who have gone south; its name was mentioned once in "Shangshi Street," this is the second time.</p>
<h3>After Reading "The Pulse of Italy"</h3>
<p>— Bella Tu</p>
<p>After reading "The Pulse of Italy" (originally "Fontamara") by the Italian anti-fascist writer Silone, my heart is pounding; this is not because I am afraid of seeing the cruelty of the fascist rule, I am one million percent angry for those Italian poor peasants who were persecuted by the fascists. My heart is leaping wildly, enraged by Silone's work!</p>
<p>We read the literary works of various countries, but now we cannot read those of Italy and Germany, there is no room for culture there! The so-called "colonial literature," "military literature," and some "ode literature" that praises "Party Masters" are just fascist ornaments! The real value of literature cannot be found in those "works"!</p>
<p>Therefore, today, when we read Mr. Silone's "The Pulse of Italy," we cannot but say that it is an unexpected sweet fruit, but this sweet fruit does not bring a fresh and sweet taste, but a bitter and sour taste, which is truly woven from the blood, tears, and healthy voices of the Italian people!</p>
<p>What exactly is fascism? We may have found answers in some theoretical books, but in living artistic images, we have not been as concretely told as in Mr. Silone's "The Pulse of Italy." In this book, it tells us that the fascists try every possible means to exploit the poor peasants of Fontamara Village. Once the poor peasants cannot make a living, a large number of Blackshirt troops are sent to beat them into a chaotic mess - my way of talking can only be said abstractly like this. You want to ask why the Blackshirt troops are only sent at this time to beat the poor peasants into a chaotic mess? Because first: these poor peasants can no longer "squeeze out blood" (Shanghai gangster slang, meaning they don't have a penny.); second, since they can no longer "squeeze out blood," and those people always have to "live," but unfortunately they can't even suck a little of their own "blood" to "live." In order to strictly prevent them from making trouble, it is best to kill them!</p>
<p>That's what fascism is.</p>
<p>The form of this book is novel, narrated by three poor peasants, but Mr. Silone's high artistic skill does not make us feel lonely because of the "narration." On the contrary, step by step, he grips our chest, making us unable to breathe, and forcing us to keep reading. In the meantime, when our chest feels tight, Mr. Silone gives you a hearty laugh with a bit of humor, but this hearty laugh does not completely relax your tight chest. On the contrary, after your hearty laugh, you feel even more tight, which means; the poor peasants are more exploited, and the cruelty of the fascists is even more displayed! This way of writing really deserves our attention.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Hong Kuangcheng</p>
<p>Living in dryness, without any seasoning, and even unable to integrate with "new" elements. Here, like a prisoner in jail, the terrible monotony entangles him, depriving him of the joy of "life," submerging his hope, making him unable to seek anything, even "fantasy," cannot give him enjoyment.</p>
<p>When people are dissatisfied with life, they yearn for their future and envy other different lives. They want to learn, they want to improve life.</p>
<p>Some people say; life must be close to the "new" in order to explode little sparks, ignite people's life fire, towards the bright path. What is most taboo is to re-seek old dreams and walk the path that people have already trampled on and abandoned, which can make people decay. Unless it is an old man, an old man who is near his twilight years, their white hair is old, their hearts are lonely, they don't like change, they like to walk in desolation and detachment.</p>
<p>Swallowing dry and hard bread all day long, without drinking a sip of plain water or a glass of milk, will soon make you sick; life is the same, without any moisture, it produces supermen and misanthropes.</p>
<p>Life is even less conservative, always changing, it must absorb new elements, especially young people, cannot be bound in the old scope.</p>
<p>In this complex group of people, to obtain the truth, we must experience various lives, various different lives, dynamic and changing. Only in this way can we recognize this world, this humanity.</p>
<p>Live with the changes of life, don't create an ideal country, blindly lofty, but unable to recognize the social people.</p>
<p>We want to improve life, not be slaves to life.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>The author of the first article on the 19th of this month is "Chenxi," "Chen" was mistakenly written as "Chen," and should be corrected. Editorial Department</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Original by Deng Sanan, Translated by Wang Fen</p>
<p>No one can say which moment in the trenches is the most tense. No one can single out any particular time and, with a dismissive tone, call it "a typical moment in the trenches." Life in the trenches is always the same. Relatively speaking, the most tense time is probably half an hour before dawn, which is the most suitable time for an attack, and also when people are most carefully defended. According to old war concepts, it was the most dangerous time, the time when the defender was weakest and most afraid of being attacked. Because darkness favors the attacker, just as night favors the lion; by dawn, they can hold the ground they have gained. Therefore, in every war, in every trench, at this perilous moment, the sentries are the most attentive in defense, and are equipped with more guards than during the entire night. When the first lark flies from the grass, they are on guard in the darkness. In any place, in any war, you can be sure that at this time, people will be crowding the breastwork of the trenches: while people in the cities are sleeping soundly, they are standing guard over there.</p>
<p>When the dawn begins to break, and the sky shows a fish-belly white color, gradually spreading, and the shadows suddenly become clearly visible, the time for attack has passed, and perhaps a faint feeling of pleasure will arise in the hearts of new soldiers; but in reality, isn't this moment just like any other moment? It is just an ordinary fragment of trench life.</p>
<p>The dawn shyly reveals itself, the breeze blows unintentionally, and while people are still watching the darkness, the light of dawn is already faintly visible in the east. When did the darkness fade? When did the dawn turn golden? Everything happens in an instant, in an instant that you cannot see. The cannons no longer flash; the sky is bright and clear; the morning is like the victory that is about to come during the tyrannical reign of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor. After dawn, the soldiers removed the bayonets from their rifles, stepped down from their posts in the trenches, and used steel rods to clean their rifles. This work is not done by all the soldiers at the same time, but separately; not only in the morning, but at any time, one cannot call all the soldiers to clean their rifles at the same time.</p>
<p>They wiped away the dirt or rainwater that had splashed on their rifles during the night; they disassembled the gun chamber to see if the spring was usable; they disassembled the breech plug, applied a little oil, and then reassembled the various parts that had been cleaned: thus, another night had passed; followed by a day closer to victory.</p>

<h3>A Complete View of Nan Tiesheng's Art (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bing Jiu</p>
<p>Nan Tiesheng's short ten-day performance at the Golden Theater has generated quite different opinions. In fact, it is indeed commendable that Tiesheng, having come from amateur opera, is judged by amateur standards. However, it would be somewhat debatable to make harsh demands based on professional artistic standards. In the amateur period, having one skill is enough to become famous, while professional performers must be proficient in all aspects to be considered excellent. Now that Nan has become a professional performer, the standards for judgment should also be slightly stricter. I have listened to his "Complete Yutangchun" and "Silang Visits His Mother" twice, and I feel that although his art is refined, it has not yet achieved overall consistency. Therefore, I will describe my observations separately:</p>
<p>Appearance and Stage Presence: Stage presence does not completely equate to demeanor, nor does it purely refer to appearance. Rather, it is an abstract term that encompasses both demeanor and appearance. Nan's original appearance is already very handsome, and after applying makeup, he becomes even more beautiful. The contours of his face are slightly uneven due to the powder applied unevenly on both sides of the nose bridge, and the position of the pasted hairpieces is too far back, which is a bit of a flaw. His height and build are well-proportioned, and his weight is suitable. His appearance is luxurious, seeming fluid yet still, seemingly gentle yet not soft, lacking in coquettishness but with plenty of elegance. His spirit shines brightly without being outward, which is in line with the pursuit of dignity and solidity. Therefore, he performs tragedies far better than comedies, and playing the Qingyi role is more suitable than playing the Huashan role.</p>
<p>Singing and Recitation: Tiesheng's voice is both strong and gentle, broad and bright, sweet and mellow, possessing all of these qualities. His high notes do not crack, and his low notes flow smoothly, and he has a rich, watery sound, indeed possessing some of Wang Hua's style. Although Tiesheng studied with Yao Qing, his singing style is mostly privately learned from Wang Hua. The tail sounds of his soaring notes are somewhat indulgent, resembling the Huashan style, which is not the correct sound for Qingyi. In general, the flavor of elaborate singing is often thin and superficial (performers with deep skill can compensate for this deficiency in their voice), and it does not align with the principles of solemnity, chastity, elegance, and grace. Voices that are charming and seductive also deviate from this principle, and all of these do not meet the conditions for Qingyi. Tiesheng's dedication to this style may be to cater to the tastes of the general audience. However, his low notes are gentle and natural, similar to Huang Guiqiu, and he can often be heard singing one or two good phrases, his flavor leaning towards elegance. His breath control is excellent, which is very beneficial for performing melodies. The "joint trial" flows smoothly in one breath, with proper transitions, and is very pleasant to listen to. However, his articulation lacks consideration, and his rhythm is also unstable, which is due to a lack of stage experience and is not a serious flaw. In general, the good points of his singing are that his voice is good, his melodies are pure, he does not seek flamboyance, he always saves effort in simplicity, and he is beautiful and has substance. Moreover, his high notes are purely natural, not like Huang Guiqiu, who uses a rapid sound from the bottom of his throat to reach high notes, or Cheng Yanqiu, who uses a narrow throat to force high notes, which is very rare. His pronunciation is ambiguous, and his word sounds are even more incorrect, with a disease of being awkward and difficult to understand. The methods of intonation and the distinction between subject and object must be further studied. According to Tiesheng's style of acting, rhythmic recitation should take after Yanqiu, being elegant, accurate, and in line with the Qingyi style. Wang Hua's rhythmic recitation is soft and boneless, gentle and pleasing, which seems too greasy when applied to Qingyi. Qingyi recitation must be orderly in intonation, carefully choosing words and sentences, pronouncing each word as if it carries a thousand pounds of weight, while still maintaining its natural state, in order to properly fit the role. It should not be like the fluent and smooth recitation of various Huashan roles, which goes too far and loses the meaning of solemnity and grace.</p>
<p>On the night of the flood, he moved into a Western hotel. The location was relatively high, and there was no water when he moved in. The next morning, the water was two or three feet high, so he decided to leave Tianjin. At that time, the Taikoo Shuntian wheel happened to be docked at the port, so he managed to come to Shanghai. The ship was unbearably crowded, and food was a problem, so each person's food ration was only half of what it usually was. Furthermore, they encountered a hurricane along the way, truly a case of misfortune never coming alone. After the flood in Tianjin, most of the food was washed away, causing a huge problem. Therefore, even ordinary domestically produced biscuits cost several yuan in foreign currency per pound. A bottle of sugar sauce even cost five yuan in foreign currency. This has a huge impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. These disaster victims are in urgent need of relief, and it would be as kind as giving them a new life if all the great benefactors could quickly provide assistance. When asked about how theatrical performances could help with the disaster relief, he said that if someone were to initiate it, he would gladly help them succeed.

<h3>Zhang Eyun Talks About the Tianjin Flood</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun came to Shanghai to escape the Tianjin flood. The reporter visited Zhang at Jin's mansion and talked about the flood in detail. The following is a record:</p>
<p>On the day the water came, it was raining heavily. On that day, the local alarm kept sounding, but the British and French concessions had not yet seen any accumulated water, so the China Grand Theater opened as usual on that day, with a crowded audience at the opening. By halfway through, the audience gradually withdrew, and by the time it was closing, most of the audience had left, as the situation was already very tense that day. The show ended around 5 o'clock, and the British Concession had already accumulated water, but the French Concession had not, so the night show was scheduled to proceed as usual. Around 7 o'clock, the French Concession was also flooded, and the water came very fiercely, so it was decided to stop the performance. When the water first came, it was about a foot deep, and it rose very quickly. When he left Tianjin, the water was about ten feet high at his residence, only one or two feet away from the second floor.</p>

<h3>Garbo's New Target</h3>
<p>— Jingyuan</p>
<p>A year ago, when Swedish star Greta Garbo and famous musician Stokowski (the music conductor in "Blue Angel") were traveling together in Europe, Hollywood was rumored to be getting married, but at the time Garbo firmly denied the good news, saying that she and the musician were just closer friends. Until now, the mystery of this mysterious woman's marriage has never been broken.</p>
<p>Currently, the 34-year-old Garbo is filming "Madame Curie" (Ninotschka) with Melvin Douglas, so Hollywood is rumored to be in love with Dr. Gayelord Hauser, a well-known botanist, and newspapers and magazines believe that this is definitely not a rumor, because facts can prove it: Garbo has often spent time at the botanist's villa in Beverly Hills for the past two months.</p>
<p>Speaking of this botanist, he is very wealthy and loves movies. In the past five years, he was in love with the late female star Jean Harlow for a few months. Now he has become Garbo's new target, and Hollywood people are waiting for the day they get married.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>A Man of Courage</h3>
<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>"Dodge City"</p>
<p>After the Civil War, when building the new Dodge City, the bully Jeff Surrett in Dodge City, relying on his many followers, did all kinds of evil. The residents were intimidated by the tyranny and dared to be angry but dared not speak out, but they were eager for treatment. Wyatt Earp led immigrants to Dodge City. After witnessing Jeff Surrett's evil deeds, he resolutely took the position of police chief and decided to eliminate the scum in the city. Newspaper editor Zoe Clemens hated Surrett's behavior and secretly collected evidence of his crimes, but was assassinated by Surrett. After Wyatt Earp captured the assassin, he escorted the prisoner to Wichita for questioning. He met Surrett's followers in the car and wiped them all out in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>This story tells us that trying to rule everything by relying on the power of tyranny will eventually lead to a day of collapse. The residents of Dodge City submit to Jeff Surrett only because they fear his tyranny; however, the fire of anger increases day by day with tyranny. Wyatt Earp is just the fuse, and the masses behind him are the force that destroys Surrett and his followers!</p>
<p>Under the excellent skill of director Michael Curtiz, the progress of the whole film is always tense and lively, especially the handling of several big scenes, which is extremely moving.</p>
<p>For example, Ewell Brown's drunken shooting, the cattle were frightened by the gun, running around, Ewell Brown could not avoid it, was trampled to death; and the fight in the hotel was very tense and vivid. The climax in the train at the end is even more outstanding. It is written like this: Wyatt Earp escorts the murderer onto the train; the train starts; Surrett's followers jump on the back of the train; crawling on the roof of the car; Abbie catches a glimpse of a figure crossing the carriage; the gangsters hold guns and monitor the driver; the rest of the gangsters walk to Wyatt Earp's carriage; Abbie's suspicion; the gangsters enter Wyatt Earp's car; Wyatt Earp and Dr. Irving alertly avoid it; both sides bombard; Abbie hears the gunfire and stands up; the car inadvertently catches fire; the murderer struggles in the flames; Abbie enters, is held by the gangsters, and forces Wyatt Earp to disarm; Wyatt Earp removes the handcuffs for the murderer in the flames; the gangsters leave the carriage and lock the door; the gangsters on the prairie fly horses to rescue people; Wyatt Earp smashes the door behind the car; the gangsters jump from the carriage onto horseback; Wyatt Earp and Dr. Irving shoot at the galloping horses; the gangsters are shot and fall off their horses... This scene is not only always trapped in a tense atmosphere, but also the descriptions in all aspects are as meticulous as hair.</p>
<p>In addition, delineating Dr. Irving's character adds a lot of fun to the film. Reducing the love between Wyatt Earp and Abbie also makes the whole film more compact.</p>
<p>Errol Flynn's Wyatt Earp still maintains his handsome and strong qualities. Olivia de Havilland's Abbie has not shown her strengths due to the limitations of the plot. Ann Sheridan only sang a few songs</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>When playing mahjong, Bian Chang always stood behind him. Whenever the gambler saw that the other had a big hand, he warned others not to call, and when he was about to call, he secretly told someone to discard a certain card. When he won, he clapped his hands and shouted, and said to the person who discarded the card, "Good boy, you are so good." If others let him win, he would still scold them. However, these people did not hate him. Whenever he won money, they would ask him for a reward. Although the gambler's appearance was fierce, in fact, he was very kind. If people followed his temperament, he would grant even impossible wishes. Ke Qin's voice was very strong in the past, and his pronunciation was solid and powerful. I have his old recordings of "Selling Rouge" and other movies. I often listen to them in my free time to relieve my love of opera. But now Chang Lao, Lin Wu, Shan Nong and Ms. Ke Qin's graves are all arched with trees. Looking back on the past, I am very sad.</p>
<p>Being Smart Ends Up Being a Joke</p>
<p>There are many famous opera performers who often like to rely on their own little cleverness to arbitrarily add or delete words in their singing and acting, or add some small gestures and clever movements, thinking that they can show their knowledge and appropriateness and show meticulous work. In fact, if one is really knowledgeable like the masters of opera, one can not only revise plays, but also write plays, and that is indeed often surprising and presented to the audience. It's just that I'm afraid that I don't have any real talent and learning, I only know a few more words than my peers. Because I have good relationships with people offstage, and I have become a popular performer, I want to add many tricks to my heart's content, so as to show my ability to be original, and ask the blind followers for a cheer; as for whether it fits the plot, I don't bother to think about it. This is exactly in line with the ugly character's words in the play "Lian Sheng Sanji": "Yo, hey, I really call you blinded!" (105)</p>
