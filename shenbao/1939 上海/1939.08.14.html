<h3>各國對遠東最低度之義務</h3>
<p>日本侵略，中國抗戰，事閱二載有餘而猶前途遼遠，安定難期，此所謂當前之遠東問題也；其實決非一時之變態，行將與時俱逝，乃爲有關過去未來之歷史問題；決非兩國之爭持，徒爲雞蟲得失，乃爲有關文明進退，利害消長之世界問題。國際對此遠東問題，謂爲視之漠然，是誠厚誣；謂旣分擔艱鉅，却又未然。、不聞南斐洲聯邦國防大臣畢羅博士論國際現象乎？渠以爲歐陸之爭，無關南斐；若遠東演變，則不容靜觀，謂白人在印度洋諸國之威望，且隨遠東而墮地；緣是而影響及於南斐，亦有遭受危險反響之可能；此非一國事，整個白人事也。語見本報十二日截路透約翰納斯堡電此其意識，甚可訾議，然以南斐離遠東之遠，猶作若此深切之感應，他地他國可知，可證國際初不漠視。美國嫉惡而同情中國，顧上月售予日本之飛機，猶値七十五萬美金之多；主觀嫉惡而客觀濟惡，消極同情而積極助虐；美國猶然，他不具論；則謂爲對此世界問題歷史問題旣已分擔何種艱鉅，不其遠乎？姑母以大義相責，嚴格相繩；極度原情論之，各國之於遠東，大都患得患失、若即若離，儘如張伯倫所稱每閱報告而血衇僨張，却仍無糾正之勇，亦未作淸算之圖，此眞相也。</p>
<p>中國對國際，期望各國；於所簽訂之各種國際條約，　踐行其對於條的之神聖義務；以切實行動，發揮一般國際原則之精神；心口如一，言行如一，務必克副其歷來宣示之意願與諾言；凡國際聯盟之會員國家，對於國聯盟的與其大會曁行政院之各種決議案，允必眞誠遵辦，夫以常理衡之，中國確有如此要求之權利，合理要求即非逾分之奢望。顧乃事實所示：正義之倫，是認中國要求之合理，抑且依據理義，輒作慷慨之聲援，卑怯之儔，語不敢及此：冷酷之徒，語此而示其齒冷；此外，則諉爲勢所不許力有未逮焉。即在中國方面，亦以鑒於大勢，委曲求全，未嘗」據所可據，爭所必爭；此則國聯集會之際，中國代表不以合理要求爲耍求標準，迄今猶將所得要求者，委之保留之中，可爲中國態度作說明也。雖然，中國委曲求全，中國以克已爲道德之故也，國際詎應以此爲可侮而毀之！國際誠危機四伏，各國誠各有其內在之困難；對此有關歷史，有關世界之遠東問題，誠有未能適應合理之標準而踐行其義務者；然亦應有其最低限度之標準焉，盡其最低限度之義務焉。換言之，凡所應爲者，即使不能爲，但所不應爲者，則應絕對不爲。</p>
<p>云何不應爲？各國未能遏止侵略，但不應助長侵略。各國未能糾正侵略之謬誤，但不應承認謬誤之事實。各國未能切實援助中國抗戰，但不應阻撓中國之抗戰。各國未能分担安定遠東之責任，但不應增進遠東之禍根。證以實例：以飛機軍火及其他軍用品供給侵略國家，此直接助長侵略也。容許侵略國家之商品銷售於市塲，使侵略國家獲有資源以購致侵略工具，此間接助長侵略也。如所謂上海海關協定，如所謂東京初步協定，如所謂軍事需要，如移解天津嫌疑犯於所謂地方官廳，此承認謬誤之事實也。中國抗戰之力量，不繫於若干千萬之銀餅，然從旁斷送中國銀餅一枚，其意義即是削弱中國抗戰之力量，故意削弱抗戰力量，與阻撓抗戰何殊？遠東局勢之安定，要在吾定侵略之理論與事實，若乃助長侵略行爲，承認謬誤事實，此其意義即以獎勵侵略，此與積極扶植遠東之禍根何殊？凡此事項，或旣爲之，或將爲之，或意欲不爲而未能毅然斥絕之；是無論所據之理由爲不得已也，爲利潤也，爲安全也，爲和平也，爲國內之政治法律也，然於遠東，於國際，於歷史，於人類文明，其爲必不應爲，詎有絲毫疑義！時至今日，若謂各國務必爲所應爲，是在理論上，道義上，乃至國際法律上，雖非奢望，雖非奢言，但事實上跡近奢望，跡近奢言矣；顧於所不應爲者，絕對不爲，非最低限度之準備耶？抑亦非各國對於遠東問題最低限度之義務耶</p>
<h3>關於津案談判　英國表明立場　經濟問題超出地方范圍　警務問題仍願友好解決</h3>
<p>（倫敦）東京電傳華北貨幣與天津存銀問題、倘不與天津警務行政問題同時解決、則日本政府即拒不與英國賡續談判、此間接近政府人士、對於此說、均不予印證、並乘機說明英國所採立塲如决、（一）中國法幣流通華北、與天津存銀問題、均超出地方範圍之外、其他各國、允其是法國、亦牽涉在內、未便由英日兩國予以解決、（二）關於天津警務問題、英國政府仍願以東京方案（指火日兩國初步協定）爲基礎、與日本政府成立友好解決方法、（三）程錫庚案四華籍嫌疑犯移交之事、絕非在法律上承認天津「中國官廳」之謂、英國方面、始終在純粹司法覲點上考慮此事、換言之、日方倘能提出充分證據、證明各該嫌疑犯之罪狀、英國政府即願位照當地經常程序、予以處理、此層前在津案發生伊始、即已聲明在案矣、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）星期日泰晤士報外交訪員今日述及英日圓桌會議日方首席代表加藤、拒絕英大使克萊琪申請根據所接英政府最近之訓令重行會談之消息、謂倫敦未接關於此事之確訊、但此說縱確、亦不足驚異、並謂英大使與日外務省對天津保安事件之談話、已臻行將妥協之地步、而以上海公共租界之警務組織爲模範、上海工部局今適由美僑佔主要地位、日本觀察可在上海目覩公共租界警務處對遏制反日活動之盡責、英方曾表露可在津作同樣措施、英政府致克萊琪之新訓令、在英人觀之、大可獲得妥協、苟非日方將此種純粹英日事件與兼與其他列强有關之外來間題混爲一起、則英日整個談話自可由此順利進行、（十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3>日本醞釀閣潮　加入德義同盟問題　平沼板垣意見衝突</h3>
<p>（東京）日本內閣現有發生閣潮之虞、日本之陸軍現又堅持與德義訂立軍事同盟、若在平時內閣遭逢此項難題、即可辭職而去、任繼任新閣解决、但在目前之國際形勢中、假若出於辭職之一途、則適足以暴露日方之弱點、故頗有兩難之勢、外相有田現正草擬對案、以便下次五相會議集會時提出討論、按陸相板垣於上星期五相會議席上、曾主張立即加入德義軍事同盟、惟其他四相（包括平沼在內）則皆反對是議、按日本內閣於五月中、其後於六月中曾兩度决定日本加入德義軍事同盟之條件、僅能在對付蘇聯之侵略時爲之、至於德義兩國與蘇聯以外之其他各國發生戰爭、則日本僅能在政治上財政上商業上援助德義、唯此項條件、當時不爲德義所贊同、唯就現勢而觀、假若日本對於德義之帮助、僅能即此而止、則德義當然亦難勉强日本作進一步之舉動、但日本之陸軍、現正竭力冀圖增加日本對於德義所負之義務、據接近日政府方面者言、平沼對於日本全然加入德義之軍事同盟堅決反對、平沼祇能贊同對付蘇聯之軍事同盟、反對訂立與民主國作戰之軍事同盟、海相米內亦反對陸軍之主張、以與德義成立軍事同盟之後、日本之海軍有在西太平洋以外地區作戰之可能性也、至於有田之對案大的可於本星期二提出、其立塲仍與往日內閣之決議無異、惟在措辭上、則擬設法滿足陸軍方面之熱望、至於英日談判、平沼與有田皆深信有成立協定之可能、假若此點可達到、則當然可以拒絕陸軍方面加入德義軍事同盟之主張也、（十二日美聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）平沼首相今日語往訪之新聞記者曰、政府將依據六月六日所決定之方針、以應付歐洲之局勢、政府現已下令、俾得以八月九日五相會議所商定之結果爲基礎、而擬具辦法、五相會議將於、本週繼續開會、首相又稱、英日會議與政府對歐政策、並無關係、政府對歐政策、將根據已定之方針進行云、關於內閣六月六日之決定、並未發表公報、但一般人皆信當時不過商妥以有限之援助給予軸心國家耳（十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3>德義互為聲援　企圖改造歐洲　爭取所謂生存攸關權利　談話竣事義外長返羅馬</h3>
<p>薩爾資堡義外長齊亞諾頃於午後二時乘坐飛機少屵遄返羅馬、里賓特洛浦外長亦即重返近郊孚施爾鎭別墅休憇、此間一般人咸謂、彼此兩國外長聚首一堂、事屬尋常、並無發表公報之必要、此决談話、係因歐洲現行時局如此、亟須檢討各種必要的措置、各論結果業已成立協定、希特勒元首與墨索里尼首相他日或有擇地會晤之可能、特此際尙非其時云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）關於德國當局與義外長齊亞諾進行談話情形、此間各報僉謂雙方不尙空談、而以實際行動爲重、國社黨機關報民衆觀察報載稱、「此决所討論者、不以但澤自由市命運爲限、實欲取消凡爾賽條的所規定之不公道的待遇、而代以自由民族生存攸關之權利、從而為歐洲樹立新秩序、」「佛朗哥孚城日報」載稱、「德義兩國成立協定爲時已久、今茲所討論者、並非合作問題、合作問題徒爲雙方談話自然的基礎而已、」其他各報則謂、此决談話非為成立一種協定、乃欲準備「切於實際的决議」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）星期日泰晤士報外交訪員聲稱、歐洲此後顯有數星期之緊張、德國似正在壓迫匈牙利與其締結軍事同盟、俾德國獲有假道匈境之權利、以進襲波蘭之側面、並由魯塞尼亞方面進攻也「另一方面、德國自無疑將允援助匈牙利向羅馬尼亞提出領土之要求、該訪員續稱、德國縱對匈國作進攻之威脅、是吾能迫令匈政府取此途徑、亦無一定把握、因匈攝政霍爾第。匈總理戴勒奇。均爲抱有決心之領袖也、（十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>下文為本埠專寫經濟金融問題論文的John　Ahlers所著，載見本期密勒氏評論報，可與數日前本報所載「叔棣」君所寫的倫敦通訊相呼應。昨據倫敦電傳，英政府已决議引渡和天津刺程案似有嫌疑的四華人，按拒絕引渡四人，是促成天津封鎖的主因，旣有今日，何必當初？英國對日，步步退讓，本文所述的賄買之舉，難保不成事實。日人若用這筆款項鞏固他們在華以武力所得的一切，那末，英國豈非間接和中國為敵！不過，英國民衆决非盡在睡夢之中，就常識而論，未必會跟着昏庸老邁的當軸同趨自殺的一途吧。</p>
<p>—譯者—</p>
<p>倫敦東京閒的一種金融佈置之「鬼」，現又在走着了，這一舉，或圖便利或圖結束兩個島帝國間的政治勾當。這個妖怪重行出現，日本主要金融界近來巳紛紛加以談論，倫敦方面，也很注意這事。若干人以為這是一個夢魔，另有人以為這是一種慣見的和為希望所鼓動的表徵。</p>
<p>假使公衆相信英日兩方所放出關於東京等處英日談判的消息，全是新聞，沒有什麼，不過是新聞罷了，那末，他們覺得太天眞了。在我們這個時代的各國中，大的·小的·老式的·新式的·秘密外交手段，又在高唱着勝利之歌。東京談判的內部事實，參加人都謹愼地不使公衆知道，這個事實，或須在後數十年才會公開細述，那時或者又談及英人重作賄買日人的企圖。</p>
<p>張伯倫和哈里法克斯勳爵雖都享着應有的尊崇，但他們却不能使吾人相信他們現親自掌理倫敦政府，和制定英國政策。吾人對平沼有田掌理東京政府和制定日本政策，或上海工部局掌理上海政務所能相信的，也正和此相同。這些大人先生，不過是願在慕後握更大權力的紳士們的發言人罷了。「平沼有田公司」，已縮成日本軍閥的代理人，「張伯倫哈立法克斯公司」，祇處理倫敦市的政治事務。</p>
<p>兩國實在握掌大權的，一是日本軍閥，一是倫敦市，近年來都給出可悲事實的充分證據，那便是他們所忘却的很多，他們所知道的絕少。他們都委身於重大的迷信，而常常似乎抹然常識。日本軍閥，深信大批屠殺和大量破壞能够造成一個使他們恣意享樂的新世界，倫敦戴大禮帽的金融家，却牢抱着一種思想，以為只要乖巧地借出金錢，便能維持他們往日經營良好的舊世界。日本軍閥，旣不能預覺他們最後將毀滅自己，倫教金融家，也不怕他們或將沿着平平鋪成的道路，最後會達到破產的地位。東京的信念，是用槍刺來支持着，倫敦以為能用金索縛牢他人的信念，目前仍未見搖動。</p>
<p>倫敦和東京，都有許多經紀人或受委託，或自吿奮勇，竭力工作，想拉攏央日兩國再相團結，這種努力所含的見解，是很簡單的。假使兩國都專心建造新世界，又假使每國對於那世界抱着不同的觀念，那末，絕無成立諒解的希望。但是今日只有日本需要新局勢，英國却願維持現局，這個事實，顯然已開啟了兩國間某種佈置的透視。居間人估計必能覓得日本所能滿意的至小限度，於是他們便能用英國所願作的至大讓步進至這個限度。</p>
<p>因為所畫的這兩條綫終未相接，便造成目前央日的糾紛，英國的金錢便在這裏流入。英國富有日木所亟需的金錢，倫敦當然不願供給日本繼續作戰的經費，但經紀人會說：倫敦市準備輔助日人整理用武力所奪得的一切，而使生利，只要日人停止向英人的利益方面繼續掠取。這個建議，使日本金融界大為興奮，因為他們對於戰爭已覺饜足，現在要獲得結果，那種結果或將用日本私人資本主義盈虧賬上較高的數字方式來表明的。</p>
<p>用英國的金鎊賄買日人的槍刺，徒求苟安，也是促成一個原因，這並不是新的見解。百年後，著作現代歷史的人在握筆時，大的會覺得這種見解和古時日趨腐敗的羅馬並拜占廷帝國所行的技倆，沒有多大區別。那兩個帝國常常被各種野蠻民族威脅勒索，假使某種野蠻人的權力已到了咄咄可畏的地步，他們的大軍，已進至羅馬或君士坦丁城下，那古時的皇帝，便從地窖中取出巨數金錢，獻給敵人，請他們挾同在各省和帝國京城所據得的財寳退回故巢。所獻的金錢，往往比從事苦鬥所費之數為少，但那些野蠻人慾壑難饜，去了又來，來了再去，不計决數，最後帝國的財庫空匱，無可再獻，於是便被滅亡了。</p>
<p>今日賄買日人，在表面上當然具着一種事業勾當的性質。或為信用放款，或為借款，或只付利息，一時不還本，或加利，或折扣，或發行公債，或用各種金融上的巧妙佈置，金融家自將得到佣費，柔羊不免受有創痛。日人呢，自將正式聲明負償還的義務，遵守一切訂定的條件，除了金融協定之外，或尙有一種公開的或秘密的條的，日人將在的中聲明他們由此决中國戰事中得到若干數量的戰利品，和英人所付的賄金，已心滿意足，今後將安分守己。這種協定的成立，絕非不可能的，但是其中却有一個大問題，那便是日本在這種或他種條約所簽的字，有何價値可言呢？</p>
<p>就金融而論，日人貌似很可尊重的，他們指出一切到期的外債，都如期付淸的事實。這些日木外債，由美國經紀人或銀行經手的，的確享有絕高正常的等級，從未到期不付，不過假使這决英國不唸「啟庫的咒語」，日本能吾繼續小心維持這些外債的信用，却是一個很大的疑問。日本外匯的地位，現已緊迫逮於極度，正金和外匯準備金，現已非常之少，假使日人須在目前戰爭中始終償付到期的外債，他們的目的，顯然要在早遲間獲得其他外債和信用放款。假使不能償願，他們的借款政策似必變更的。最近東京報紙，已隱露日本或將停止償付外債，以報復前曾一度允供給借款的盎格路薩克遜列强。</p>
<p>再有一層，日本的金融政策是雙面的，這是時常為人所忽略的一件事。在遠東大陸，這種政策名譽壞到極點，日人在所佔中國的各區域內，毫不尊重私人的產業·權利·義務，一再恣意佔用。沒收。和作金融的欺詐。賭博，令人萬分震驚。為要知道吾人將作何種反抗起見，吾人不得不注意日人在華流通的各種偽日幣偽華幣的命運，注意日人在華如何處置他們自己的和朝鮮的貨幣，注意日人沒收中國海關和鐵路的收入，而使中國的外債不能如期償付。日人在兩年戰爭期內在華所作的金融保證，巳有數十起，未能履行，這也是應注意的。</p>
<p>日人這種對金融不自尊軍的榜樣，縱然置之不顧，然而筆者依然對於僅僅因為日人繼續償付外債，便把日人金融保證的價値，認為高於政治保證，却百思不得其故。試看日人在九國公的所簽的字，會如何尊重，再看侵略者對中國開放門戶原則，和在華泰西列强的利益，又曾如何尊重，有了這種經騐，自當詢問日人任何的保證，將來自將履行一節，是吾能得到些微的担保？</p>
<p>最近接續十年之中，日人一次復一次不顧對於中國和其他固定的利益所負的一切義務和担任，這是他們在華一成不變的政策。日人爲圖對抗和自饜起見，逐漸進行他們的願望，結果，使華人和他國人士完全陷於浩劫之中。日人決不因任何讓步而實在滿意，每次因日人鼓起的錯誤信念所作的讓步，以爲這是最後一次，却不知日人乘機利用，大獲其益。他們每决獲得讓步之後，不久便又造成糾紛，而要求繼續讓步以淸理這種糾紛。所以日人在遠東享有抱無底慾壑，毫無忌憚，絕不可靠的名譽，那是名副其實的，而倫敦方面却依然有不知日人這種名譽的人士</p>
<p>英國已往對日的政策，錯誤百出，假使仍不覺悟，再蹈覆轍，而在今日希圖賄買日人，可算是錯誤到了絕頂。日人正在需款若渴之際，竟有人願意供給，自然樂於收納。他們取到之後，將用此鞏固目前荏弱的金融地位，等到地位鞏固，便叉要和英國等為難，於是到了尖銳化時，再來一决新要求，並將竭力玩弄他們出色的敲詐把戲，重行破壞一切的的言。不但給他們的金錢全數喪失，不但東京為欲速獲款項所準備給予的保證，抺煞凈盡，並且將用這筆款項，凖備對供給此款者施行更凶惡的攻擊。</p>

<h3>滙劃制度</h3>
<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>本年七月，上海銀錢兩業同業公會，為充實同業營業準備，調劑工商業資金起見，決議由銀行聯合凖備會收受各行莊提供之財產，供給滙劃。實行以來，各界賢明之士，著文討論者頗多，指示獎譽，盛意可感。茲專就匯劃制度之今昔，試作一有茶統之叙述，以供研究，並希賜敎。</p>
<p>何謂滙劃</p>
<p>滙劃為票據款項，平時可以　日收現，與普通票據之差別，僅在當日為隔日。八一三後，受不得收現乃有「戰時封鎖通貨」之性質。惟匯劃歷史悠長，行使習慣，常有改變與例外。上述云云，僅可視為一種解釋，未能遽作定義。</p>
<p>一三前之匯劃</p>
<p>（一）滙劃制度之形成滙劃制度之形成，由於上海之錢莊業。遠在六七十年前，上海商業，日漸繁盛，票據之行使，已為商人所必需，支票性質之錢莊劃條及支單，本票性質之莊票，皆成商業上主要之收付工具，因錢莊信用之優良，實力之充裕，莊票尤為中外商人所歡迎。此種票據所代表之金額，為匯劃銀子或匯劃洋鈿，亦稱同行銀子或同行洋鈿。其時錢莊已有匯劃總會之組織，加入總會之錢莊稱匯劃莊，」其相互間票據之收付，每張金額逾五百兩五百元者，當日皆就總會以公單軋帳，如持票人要求收現，則須俟决日方可照付。考此種隔日收現之習慣，一般意見，以為係為抵制外商銀行之侵軋而起，其目的在使錢莊應付外灘頭寸，可以早一日預備，不致臨時局促。實則錢莊之匯劃制度，原以信用為基礎，其票據之付款，通常均以轉帳為之，故現金凖備，可以減少，若遇收現，乃有先事籌措之必要也。</p>
<p>（二）匯劃之產生及其通　錢莊匯畫之產生，即匯劃票據之發票，一由於放款，即為信用之製造，二由於存款之付出。就理論言之，信用之製造基於存款，而存款之增加，一部份由於放款，兩者互為因果，故謂錢莊匯劃之產生，大部份由於信用之供給可也。</p>
<p>匯劃票據最後執票人，對於票據金額之取得，或存入錢莊，是為存款之移轉，或由外灘銀行隔日收現，或支付加水，當日換取現銀或現洋。實際上除外灘銀行之隔日收現外，其最後之歸宿，常為錢莊，其餘之收現，恐屬不多</p>
<p>匯劃之供給者旣為錢莊，市上流通量之增減，遂視錢莊放款之弛緊為轉移，而匯劃流通量之平衡，則有錢莊公議這拆息行市及劃頭加水行市為之調節。</p>
<p>（三）匯劃範圍之包括華商銀行　錢莊之支付籌碼為滙劃，外灘華商外商銀行之支付籌碼為劃頭，「劃頭」即當日收現之票據款項，係「匯劃」之對稱。民元後華商銀行增設日多，除外灘部份外，大部劃頭與匯劃兼用，亦有純用匯劃者。華商銀行之用匯劃，實由各行以一部份營業支付準備金存放錢莊，藉此利用錢莊之軋帳制度，凡自己對同業應收應付票款，皆就存放戶為之；同時此項營業支付準備金，復可因存放而生利。匯劃制度之範圍，由是包括華商銀行在內。</p>
<p>上述情形中，有應行注意之一點，即銀行業與錢莊業相互間之匯劃存欠情形，在銀行始終為存，在錢莊始終為欠，錢莊與錢莊之間，則有存有欠，前者俗稱「多單，」後者俗稱「缺單。」</p>
<p>（四）銀行票據交換所成立後銀錢業滙劃存款之集中二十二年一月，銀行票據交換所正式開辦，各行向凖備會存入相當之支付準備金，為票據交換差額收得之需，準備會收受此項存款，轉存中國交通兩銀行，（二十五年中央銀行加入交換所，準備會收受各項存款，即分存中中交三銀行，）因劃頭票據及劃滙票據必須各別交換，其差額須各別轉帳，故各行存入準備會之款項，亦有劃頭與滙劃之別。此項滙劃存款，大都自原存錢莊款項中移轉而來，於是各行原存錢莊之款，一部份集中於準備會，另一部份，仍留錢莊，為各行對錢莊票據收付之需。二十四年六月，錢業發生風潮，各行依同業公會之決議，將存放各莊之款，一律轉存於錢業準備庫，銀行向錢莊收票，一律託銀行準備會代收，於是上述另一部份存放錢莊之款，至此亦完全集中於中中交三行。自此以後銀行與錢莊間之存欠情形，巳有變動，即原來分存各莊者，現皆集中於準備會，準備會轉存三行，三行轉存錢業凖備庫。各錢莊對凖備庫之款項往來，一部份為多單，其餘均為缺單。</p>
<p>八一三後之匯劃制度　（一）滙劃之不得收現　八一三滬戰起，財政部頒布安定金融辦法，對於銀錢業存戶提取存款，定有限制。在銀錢業自身，雖因此可無大量提存之慮，而當時最緊要之問題，即滬市流通籌碼，將因限制提存而不敷，亟應設法籌措，使工商業不致停頓。銀行業同業公會緊急會議決議，擬具安定金融補充辦法，呈部核准施行，凡商業存款，得於原定限度外支取滙劃，而匯劃則以銀錢同業轉帳為限，不得收現。錢業方面，亦為同樣之措置。</p>
<p>政府，之戰時貨幣政策，不但始終　免膨漲，其初且趨緊縮，上海為全國金融樞紐，當時又為密通前之後方。銀錢業仰體政府苦心，力求市面安定，故就原有滙劃制度，加以適當利用。在限額外支付滙劃，係對工商業必要資金為積極的供給。涎劃之不能收現，則對上述資金，為戰事的封鎖。實為非常時期內之非常措置。當時銀錢業奉令休業三日，於八月十七日全體復業，姿態整齊，應付沈着，滬戰三個月中，市面絕鮮紛擾。此法適用於全國各地；但未有滙劃制度之他埠，工商業頗有資金缺乏之感。當一二八時，錢業對付滙劃票據，亦曾有不能收現之限制，惟行之甚暫耳。</p>
<p>（二）匯劃貼水掉現　戰時匯劃制度實行後，在向來習用匯劉之本國工商業間，頗稱便利。惟因匯劃不能購買外匯，而其轉帳範圍，復限於本國之金融業，故外商銀行，因此漸加歧視，拒不收受，進口商人，漸有以售貨所得匯劃，减低百分之一或二，掉取法幣以供需要。嗣後市上滙劃數額增多，現款反覺不足，於是收集法幣，以買賣滙劃而圖利者，乘機風起。二十七年叫月起，中中交三行委託準備會對同業法幣需要，酌量調劑；貼水掉現之市面，乃見穩定。然匯劃旣可掉現，行之日久，取巧者亦多；資金之封鎖，因此遂見漏卮。蓋銀錢業對顧客之供給，本限於進口商人眞正之需要，但一一欲加預期之嚴格，事實上殊不可能。至二十八年五月，三行曾與準備會籌商，擬將法幣供給停止，祇因鑒於市面人心之易受激刺，致議而未行。</p>
<p>（三）政府之再度限制提存　二十七年起，市面情形，畸形發展，至二十八年春夏而益顯，茲將重要各點，列舉如决：</p>
<p>（一）各地避難民衆，密集上海；銀錢　存款有增無减；游資充斥。</p>
<p>（二）人口激增，都市生活浪費，入超更鉅。</p>
<p>（三）黑市塲外匯購買之風，依然如故；自六月七日外匯降至六便士五之新水準後，購者益多。</p>
<p>（四）日人收集淪陷區法幣，套取外匯，變本加厲。</p>
<p>（五）貨物投機之風漸長。</p>
<p>六月二十一日，滬銀錢業奉財政部馬（二十一日）電，對提取八一三後存入之法幣存款，加以限制。其時銀錢業支付能力充裕，此項限制之原意，純為對外匯投機及資金逃避者加以約束。即就提存限度觀之，　較安定金融辦法，寬逾三倍，可以瞭然。實行後，大量投機，原已稍戢。惟以滬市環境，近來大不如前；無謂及惡意之謠諑，至此乘機紛起。一般普通存戶，原無提取存款之意，頗多因謠詠而誤會，亦粉紛儘量提取限度內之存款而加以窖藏。銀錢業雖應付裕如，亦不得不增强實力，共策善後，於是乃有「新匯劃制度」之產生。</p>

<p>（一）何謂新匯劃制度在叙述新匯劃制度前，吾人應知「新匯劃制度」乏名詞，實屬不甚確切，因報紙上及同業間均已採用，而目前尙無其他適當之名詞，姑暫借用。新匯劃制度之施行，並非就八一三後之匯劃性質加以變更，其主要特點，簡言之即係「銀錢業滙劃支付準備金之强化」而巳。</p>
<p>六月底銀錢業聯席會議，討論限制提存後市面情形之應付與善後，決定就銀錢業之同業匯劃支付凖備金，加以適當之調整，調整方法為</p>
<p>（一）各行莊原有之匯劃頭寸，（即各行莊原存準備會準備庫之存款）　一律按百分之九十五折合法幣，由準備會分十二個星期掉換。</p>
<p>（二）由準備會收受各行莊提供之財產，供給匯劃，發行總額暫定五千萬元。</p>
<p>（二）銀錢業匯劃支付準備金之「强化」準備會除將各行莊原存之匯劃存款分期掉換法幣外，自七月四日起，担任同業滙劃支付準備金之供給事宜。一，同業匯劃，以財產為準備。各行莊領用匯劃，須以領用辦法內特定之財產，繳存準備會為担保品，領用匯劃之數，不得逾財產評價額百分之七十。二，上述財產之檢查評價及保管，由本市中西銀錢業代表，中西各業專家担任之，而銀錢業相互間之票據收解，亦於七月四日起，完全集中於準備會。</p>
<p>準備會定有同業滙劃領用辦法，及銀錢業匯劃凖備檢查規則，均見報載，茲不具述，吾人試將銀錢業滙劃支付準備金之今昔，一作比較，則（甲）從前之滙劃支付準備金，即係各銀行各錢莊對缺單錢莊之間接放款，其最後擔保為各缺單莊之資產及股東責任，此項滙劃債權債務關係，（各行存準備會，準備會存三行，三行存錢庫，錢庫存缺單各莊，已如前述，）在多單之銀行及錢莊，已因掉換法幣而消滅，在三行對準備庫，準備庫對各缺單莊之間，現正另行辦理。（乙）現在之滙劃支付準備金，則係以百分之百以上之財產為準備，而由中西各界領袖，負檢查評價保管之責者也。</p>
<p>（三）新制施行後滙劃之流通因銀行對工商業滙劃供給，大都係開發凖備會付款之支，故　劃準備之强化，無異流通匯劃之直接保。八一三後拒收匯劃之外商銀行，巳有因而收受者。惟銀錢業以外之滙劃貼現，事實上尙難取締，在人心杌隍，環境艱難之今日，投機家尙得乘時活動，强事把持，今凖備會對滙劃據現之調劑，　於限制提存之始，實行停止，即使貼水暗市，續有飛漲暴落之情形，而其活動範圍巳小，封鎖資金之畸形外漏，此後不難完全防止也。此外有足遺憾者，最近因外一再緊縮，市面益感不安，本市各業中已有用匯劃之事。</p>
<p>（四）滙劃證之備而不用新匯劃制度實行之始，銀錢業以滙劃票據有時效關係，為便於日常之授受起見，曾擬由準備會發行匯劃證，準備會對於最後執票人之付款，可以滙劃證支付之。旋以（一）同業匯劃準備之强化，預測匯劃證將大受歡迎，若一般民衆，以信任法幣者信任滙劃證，紛將滙劃證加以窖藏，則各行莊繳存準備會之財產，殊有「呆擱」之可能，豈不與凖備會供給籌碼，便利工商之旨，大相逕庭。（二）滙劃證籌議之初，市上發生流通券之謠言，雖眞相一明，謠傳目止，而在人心不安之今日，自以審愼為宜。故滙劃證備而不用，此後恐亦無發行之需要也。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>匯劃制度之歷史，戰時封鎖之意義，支付準備金之强化情形，巳略如上述，吾人所應明瞭者；（一）匯劃本為隔日收現之票據款項，與劃頭本為同一貨幣，其價値不容有二，一不能收現」為戰事期間之非常措施，具　積極的性質，預測戰事停止後，此項封鎖，必可撤除，將來匯劃制度或將根本廢除，至少在廢除之前，將先恢復隔日收現之舊制。（二）目下滙劃與法幣有鉅數差價，純由於金融業以外之投機及漁利，在向來習用滙劃之工商業間愼勿改變習慣，使銀錢業仍得於法幣提存限度以外，供應資金，續予輔助。（三）政府貨幣政策力求健全，巳往之措施，其目的無一不在健全金融機構，保全國家元氣，本市民衆，愼勿聽信流言，自受損失也。</p>
<h3>上海通貨市塲之今日</h3>
<p>— 陳仁濤</p>
<p>外滙黑市</p>
<p>「八一三」日軍侵滬，以迄今茲，適周兩年。上海之淪陷，則亦一年半矣。在此時期，環境特殊，凡所經歷，洵非其他淪陷區域所可倫比。最足驚人者，為外匯黑市之暴落，物價之在漲，與乎人口之陡增三項現象。而以外匯黑市之暴落為允甚。</p>
<p>四個階段</p>
<p>外匯黑市雖變化萬端，但統體視之，過往兩年間，可分析為四個階段：</p>
<p>第一階段自八一三滬戰發動起，至翌年二月止，上海外匯市價，始終穩定於英匯一先令二便士，美匯二十九元左右。此項比價，與二十四年十一月四日貨幣改制時所定法價，相差極微。抗戰展開，匯價如恒；足證政府支持之效力，民衆擁護之熱忱，其時海運中止，進口停頓，政府施行安定金融辦法，限制提有，市上法幣，流通數額復少，亦為穩定當時匯價之有力因素。</p>
<p>第二階段　二十七年春，政府制定進口外匯申請與出口外匯售結兩辦法而發生外匯黑市塲後，至本年二月為止，因日方控制物資，貿易出入，隨之消長。政府銀行對於申請外匯之核准，逐步加嚴；營工商業與投機者，乃轉求於黑市。同時英人為謀維持海關行政之現狀，向日方表示妥協；致授日人以搜集法幣之一大機會，厥後復有十月間廣州漢口之陷落；上海外匯穩定局面，亦起動搖，英匯退至八便士，英匯逼近十六元。</p>
<p>第三階段本年三月中，中英聯合成立外匯平準基金委員會；上海通貨市塲，乃步入第三階段。合中，交，匯豐，麥加利四銀行之力，集成英金一千萬鎊。此項組織產生於中英之邦交，且亦因法幣歷史關係，合利害相共之兩造，作明朗之支持。</p>
<p>第四階段　當第二階段時，整個上海，沉洏於畸形繁榮之中。逮夫第三階段，畸形繁榮，達最高峯；人口大量集中，游資相隨而來；所反映者：進口物品之消耗有增無已；投機趨於白熱化；一面有市民之收購外匯，逃逸資金；一面有日偽機關，盡量套取外匯。在此內外夾攻之下，平準基金，乃有六月七日之暫停供給，六月二十二日之第二决限制提存等措施；以期調整匯市，安定金融，防堵逸資與套買。不明眞相者惶惑莫辨，謠諑紛傳。外匯暗市，遂至暴落。英匯破四便士，美匯僅六元强。作者認此為上海通貨市塲第四階段之展開。</p>
<p>兩種觀點</p>
<p>自上海外匯暗市暴縮後，其反映最烈者，為物價之暴漲，人心之恐慌；猜疑百出，議論紛紜。其中竟有兩種不同觀點，概述之：</p>
<p>主張任其自然以為上海黑市匯價，為地方局部問題；即使極度下落，亦不足動搖法幣信用及本身價値而使之下降。試舍上海而言，非淪陷區域物價之相當穩定，初不若上海市塲之暴漲；（間有因供求或運輸原因而漲者則當別論）足證上海一隅匯價之升降，斷不能範統代表法幣之實値？嘗聞有誣法幣將為馬克之續云云，妄人妄語，無待駁斥。</p>
<p>復次，由整個國家立塲言，舉凡資金逃逸或日偽套取所形成外匯下降之結果，皆這來正當之消耗；理有杜絕之必要。况進口物品，大率奢侈性質，際此國難當前，允應杜絕享用。在滬市無法控制之情形下，漏巵洞開，無異資</p>
<p>吾人試究政府以前支持外匯基金之來源，舍國內原有存銀之收集及發行凖備金外，或為華僑匯款，或為友邦援助，以及農礦物產輸出所易得之外滙；是則以政府慘淡經營之所得，多數農工辛勤之收穫，理應以換取戰時急需品為第一，乃今移用於此？言之痛心！故幽默家有「舍飛機大砲而取花粉香水，供上海一隅之奢用」之譏。故在性質上，亦主張任其自然。</p>
<p>主張繼續維持其言曰：政府歷决聲言穩定匯價革財相外相亦有有決意支持公開之表示，因通貨之於人民，猶空氣之於生物，不可須臾離者。法幣在滬市一旦發生動搖，乘隙而起者即大有人在，華興偽幣，窺伺在側；外商建議，亦囂塵上；姑不論其無實行之可能，然此皆足以撼動法幣在滬之基礎，並予歐美在華貿易利益以重大打擊。英人在華有八十餘年之歷史，莫大之權益，豈甘任人剝奪凈盡？以歐美人士之機智，計必及之。基此而論，目前環，雖極度困難，歐美人士為自身利害計，亦支持上海滙市之必要；政府常局，更應作妥之措施。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜上兩種觀點：以其立論不同，故絕對矛盾。故一部份通貨，處此嚴重氣壓下，分道而竄；析其去處，的有三途：</p>
<p>（一）外匯投機工商業家，投機家，一般殷富，以及日偽機關，靡不猛力吸收，以致造成今日對外比價之最低紀錄。</p>
<p>（二）移資內地銀行內滙，懸優惠之滙誘致資金；政府倡導，奧論贊助；中小工家，挾相當資金，前往西南，遷地創業者，大不乏人。蓋內地法幣，仍有正常之價値，凡百企業，又無不可以獲利，旣可避免通貨在外匯價格上之威脅，並得在內享受政府之保障。</p>
<p>貨物投機另一部份分，明知資余不宜外逸；移資內地，或受某種牽制，故有囤積物品，靜待時變者。最近一旬間，主要物品，受高價收購而價格暴漲，可為例證。</p>
<p>作者以為：當前上海通貨之匯價，從利害觀點言：與英美貿易前途，其關係之重耍，殆駕於中國政府之上，又認為上海通貨市塲，有支持之必要，而以市民鎭定，上下協力為要着，至於英美各國，更應高瞻遠矚，誠心支持，實力援助；此正其時。至於措施技術，滙價之新水凖，似宜以能（一）應付遠東貨幣戰（二）防止大量套取與逃逸（三）消滅奢侈品之輸入三項鵠的為依歸。其决，則注意支持之方式。希望幣政當局，表示明朗之態度，並以堅實有效之辦法，支持此項新水準；則上海市塲，於波濤洶湧之後，即可復歸寗靜。</p>
<h3>日本經濟之前途（三續）</h3>
<p>— 馮美齊世士譯</p>
<p>故結果日本之匯兌困難仍無法解决。上九三九年之商品進口差額仍需如一九三七至一九三八年之以黃金運出相抵付。一九三九年初四月日本運往美國之黃金共値六〇·二〇二·八一五美元，或二二〇百萬日元。依此估計推算之，日本之黃金儲藏至本年底即將吿罄。雖此估計未以先時遝存美國之黃金計算在內。即一併計算之，一九四〇年，所存者，亦為數至微。日本於一九三九年四月前二年間共用去黃金儲藏一·五〇〇百萬日元。同時期內其生棉羊毛等出口工業原料之儲藏亦大見减少。一九三七年八月以來，其生鐵，鋼，原油，銅等軍需原料之生產與儲藏未有數字公布，惟的知其儲藏量巳大見减少。日本之支付平衡目今已極難於應付，如一旦捲入大戰，必更趨尖銳化無疑</p>
<p>上述日本經濟問題，乃根據過去二年中日戰事發生以來之情勢而論。如捲入大戰漩渦，局勢又不然。今姑觀察日本國外貿易之主要區域，以估計大戰所將給與之可能影響。</p>
<p>日木國外貿易之四大區域為：日元集團區，反共盟的國，英法荷聯盟，與美國。在大戰發生後若干時期內，日元集團區仍得為日本經濟之後盾，所能有之威脅為中國之抗戰，或與蘇聯發生衝突時滿洲之擾攘。致西方列強與美國，在短時期內必將無力顧及遠東。一九三八年日元集團區（包括中國）供給日本之貨品的値一·四八九百萬日元，日本之進口總數則為三·五八八百萬日元；其購自日本之貨品的値二·二四三百萬日元，日本出口總數則為三七，七六八百萬日元。故去歲日元集團所供給之貨品佔日本進口之七分之三，而吸收其出口之三分之二弱。（未完）</p>

<h3>統計　七月份漲價　—一百五十二起—</h3>
<p>自從六月七日上海黑市外匯劇變，英匯自八便士四分之一，美匯自十六元三十二分之三，經兩天盤旋、英匯站定六便士十六分之九，美匯定十二元三十二分之二十五後，激起物價怒吼的漲風，有如直綫般的上騰，給予居住上海的人們生計，以嚴重的威脅。正在喘息未定，而七月十七日，黑市外滙，又起驚人的縮風，英匯最低縮至三便士七五，美滙縮在六元零。其後英匯盤旋於四便士左右，美匯七元零。這樣的緊縮，物價於是叉起猛烈的漲風，弄得上海居民，有如發痙攣般的呻吟，物價是吾有這樣飛漲的必要，這在局中人自然是很明瞭的，而外界也很有精確的監視，決不是盲盡全市人們的耳目所可掩飾的。</p>
<p>現在，單就報章上的刋登通吿的漲價來親計一下，共有一百五十二起，也就是一百五十二個漲價的工商廠號及團體的單位，內中除了重漲價一起外，凈計為一百五十一起，在這一百五十一起的漲價裏，包括九十九種貨物名稱。而其漲價的程度，最高的竟達一倍，而最低的也在一成以上，比較起來，以漲二，三成的為最多數。這裏，再把漲價的一百五十二起分析，商品類別，那末，可分為十六類，就是飮食，衣着，醫藥，裝飾，日用品，包裝，金屬電器，交通運輸，文化用具，出版印刷，燃料，淸潔，廣吿，原料，油漆，土木，拍賣等。就中首推飮食二十種為第一位；衣着，金屬電器，文化用具，出版印刷各九種第二位；裝飾和日用品各八種第三位；醫藥和交通運輸各七種第四位；包裝和油漆各五種第五位；淸潔三種第六位；廣吿，燃料，土木和原料各二種第七位；拍賣一種殿末位。茲把漲價的貨物和漲價成數分說在下面：</p>

<p>今明防範　可望緩和</p>
<p>此决聯合戒備、係自九日開始、預定至十五晚撤消、故今明兩日、仍將繼續施行防範、但以昨日秩序良好、情形安謐、故今日戒備情形、當可稍趨緩和、所有駐軍及商團出防、人數將略予减少、如無意外事件發生、即將於明晚十二時後撤銷、或提早於今晚十二時後撤消、亦未可知、</p>

<p>仍歸無效、當時新領曾將交涉情形、報吿本國政府、請循外交途徑解決、但截至目前止、證明該項交涉、巳歸失敗、現被扣之葡輪、仍由日海軍扣押於黃浦江下游、據聞日方曾個別用書面通知、向各該輪所有人</p>
<p>施以壓力、欲渠等迅將船轉售日方、並限於八月底前尊重日方意志、放棄成見、查被扣之葡輪、以中國海面遭受日方封鎖、過去亦僅載運貨物、行駛於甬江·甌江·海門·及共他足以通航之口岸而已、</p>
<p>並無違禁之處、據葡領十二日晚消息、關於彼扣之商輪、雖經交涉、但仍無眉目、日方對於葡領所提要求、釋放被扣之半數、亦遭拒絕、葡領之所以不能獲得圓滿結果者、良以葡萄牙</p>
<p>並非强國所致、證以德意之商輪、一經被扣、經交涉即可釋放、事實殊為明顯也、現被扣之葡輪、計棠魯·棠貝·棠喬·海龍·美達·福祿·大德·飛德·飛化·利北·寳德·魯德等十二艘、其中寳德輸已決定售於日方、至於魯德輪輪東亦允歸日輪公司經營、</p>

<p>輪主之意日方欲租賃或收買一切沿海航輪、此等輪中計有葡輪十艘、輪員非巳解僱、即有失業之虞、聞葡領事與日海軍磋商釋放各輪事、進行甚緩、最近之發展、為日海軍建議各輪釋出、懸葡旗經營四個月後、「自動」售予日商公司、或謂日方將各輪盡行租下、聞前此之討論、因日方主張將葡輪開釋與沒收各半、遭葡領事</p>
<p>明白拒絕而中止、另一消息謂、輪主願以「禮物」贈日本紅十字會、以易彼等各輪之自由、亦遭日方拒絕、本埠葡僑對日方所表示之歧視、允感憤恨、蓋從事沿海貿易之德義輪船、時或被扣、一二日後即行釋出也、</p>

<h3>運貨入內地　可取道西貢</h3>
<p>— 竟新</p>
<p>在過去，凡欲運貨入內地者，以取道海防爲唯一之途徑，海防原非通商大埠，一旦驟成國際交通之重要口岸後，實有應接不暇之概。該地倉庫，報關手續以及火車載貨等之管理方法，甚爲紊亂，致一般客商莫不呌苦運天。最近在該埠囤積之貨物而不及裝運者實難數計，若再繼續運往，則延擱日期，更難預計矣。據最近運輸業消息，凡各運往內地之貨物，可取道西貢以代海防。爰將沿途各項費用及路由分誌於后：</p>
<p>由上海至西貢，有太古公司及法國郵船公司之輪船開往，水脚太古公司每噸港幣三十三元，法郵二十七元五角。在西貢入境時，應需納過境稅，國貨由中國內地經由香港或上海運往者，其過境稅率爲百分之一，唯貨物之價値，則須由該埠海關估價計算，洋貨値百抽四。西貢之棧房設備，較海防爲佳，凡貨物抵貢後，而欲存置棧房，在十天以內者（星期日及例假日除外）免費。第十一日須付棧租每噸每立方公尺越幣二角，嗣後即以每日一角計算之，如存棧逾三十日而尙未裝車者，須移置火車月台空地，每日每噸以三分計算。當地之貨物搬運費，由輪船至棧房或火車，每噸越幣一元二角，由碼頭至棧房或火車每噸八角，由棧房至火車每噸亦爲八角。至由西貢至河內之火車運費，計分有二種：「普通運價——Ordinary　Tariff」及「特種運價——GeneralTariff」，其區別係在取得車輛之遲速而巳，凡付特種運價者，可儘先派得車輛，以期早日裝運，付普通運價者則須依决分派，得車較遲，以是一般欲期早日裝運者，均願付特種運價也。其由西貢至河內之運價以十噸車之每噸計算，雜貨「特種運費」爲越幣一百六十一元九角六分，「普通運費」四十五元零七分。棉紗及易於燃燒之貨物，以特種運費計算每噸一百十六元五角四分，一般易於爆裂而富有危險性之貨物，每噸需三百二十四元。至由河內至昆明之運價，每一十噸車須越幣一千零二元八角。</p>
<p>由西貢經河內，如情形良好，全程需時的二十日至三十日。如由西貢循越南國有鐵路而至安南與廣西交界之同登，則得車較易。其十噸車每噸貨物運價，雜貨普通越幣四十八元七角五分特種一百八十元三角七分。棉紗每噸一百二十九元七角四分，爆裂物每噸三百六十元。凡各在中越邊境備有卡車裝貨者，則以取道同登而轉入內地爲宜。最近本埠各運輸機關鑒於取道西質之運輸情形，頗爲良好，故均紛紛辦理此項運輸。</p>
<h3>湘桂鐵路　延至永福</h3>
<p>— （晟）</p>
<p>湘桂鐵路，起自湖南衡陽，直達廣西省之桂林。嗣經路局努力建築，曾於本年四月間，通至柳州，本刋第九期業已發表。茲接桂林通訊，據云桂柳段現已延長至永福，計程四十五公里，票價三等國幣一元，二等二元，頭等三元。</p>
<h3>提貨手續簡說</h3>
<p>— （馮文焯）</p>
<p>所謂提貨，即憑貨主之棧單，向貨物所存地提取貨件是也。事固簡而易爲，然提貨者之職責，實甚重大，若稍有疏漏，即難免賠償之虞，故提貨者，若無相當經騐，實不可貿然從事也。</p>
<p>提貨者，接到提單後，首應注意貨物之所在地，及提單背面巳吾具有貨主必須之簽字或蓋章。其决再視該提單上指明貨物提交之行號是吾巳經簽字或蓋章，然後至貨物所在地之碼頭棧房取貨。提貨時應先將提單向駐碼頭海關辦事處簽蓋海關戳印，但有時因紅PP（進口報單）尙未由江海關送到，則辦事處即不允蓋印，倘提貨者代提之貨物十分緊要，亦可請由報關人向江海關申請紅PP，隨附提單往駐碼頭海關蓋印，然後再至碼頭總寫字間簽字，及掉換本提單。（即碼頭當局出具之中式棧單，交付與該碼頭棧房人昌者，惟有若干碼頭，並無是項掉換本提單手續。）在碼頭寫字間簽字時，可就便詢問貨物係堆置何號棧內，及棧租到期時日，（按各輪船公司現行章規，以船靠岸日起十天爲限。）倘提貨日，棧租已爲最末一日，提貨者務須趕速將各貨即日提淸，如遇有其他枝節發生，以致不能提貨時，亦應向貨主聲明上項情形及困難，藉免賠貼棧租之累。其允應特別留意者，則爲提取貨件各貨上之標記，（即嘜頭）是吾與提單所載之標記相符，切不可稍有差錯。又如發現貨物破爛及短少，常時不能將貨提出時，應文即請示貨主，方能決定，吾則職責所在，糾葛正多也。</p>
<p>以上所述不過碼頭及棧房之常識耳，各碼頭之提貨手續，雖略有差異，惟大體並不外乎上述。</p>
<p>至於關棧，洋棧，銀行棧，廠棧以及看破爛等手續當再抽暇續吿。</p>

<h3>夏末秋初飮食談</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>時序輸子不斷地推進，又踏進了新秋的委候了，時令旣在遞這，人體上當然也起了變化，更其在這夏末秋初，皮膚與腸胃等，由鬆弛而漸趨於緊縮，所以在這時期裏，吾人對於伙食方面，應有格外審愼之必要！方不致為疾病所乘，比如在炎夏裏，我們儘可多飮些冷飮品，和吃些瓜類，來潤腸解暑，現在已經交秋，那冷飮品及瓜菓，自應少吃為妙，不吃允佳！因為腸胃起了緊縮性，生冷雜進，必致積滯腸胃，日久便患痢疾，那末在這暑未退盡新凉漸來的當兒，究竟吃些什麼？據筆者的愚見，瓜類宜一概摒除！最好在家庭中，自煮荼荳湯，另加紅棗或芡實若干，總宜料少湯多，待凉後，摻入薄荷水及白糖，其湯清雋凉爽，較之市售的酸梅湯等要好得多！至於菜肴，亦須選擇含有維他命而易於消化的物品，如冬瓜，雪菜等，且以多吃素菜，少食葷腥，肥魚大肉，實非其時，我們爲保持健康，却除病魔起見，對於飮食，亟應審愼於先。</p>
<p>日常飮食，旣能謹愼從事，不貪食慾，但事有例列：如赴親友之宴，筵席豐盛，主人翁更殷勤勸酒，盛情難却，或不免多進肴核的時候，那末便須酌重吃些簡便的解醒清胃藥物，以資疏理。其他夜眠也宜小心，因為臨睡時太熱，貪凉少着睡衣，午夜後轉凉，又不添覆衣被，任凉氣侵入，就要阻滯食物的消化。因有連帶關係，故附筆表明，請大家注意。</p>
<h3>談談拖鞋</h3>
<p>— 普生</p>
<p>淴過浴後，如果沒有拖鞋而依舊仲進鞋子裏的話，我們一定會覺得很不舒適，因此，雖然拖鞋極其渺小，不値一談，但是在夏天倒是一件不可缺少的東西。</p>
<p>拖鞋有皮製，布製，草製三種，以皮製者為最貴，在目前皮革飛漲情勢下，一雙至少須化一元五角以上，但大都係高貴人士所採用。</p>
<p>最普通的便是布製的，以布料或綢織品來做鞋面，刺綉花鳥於上，再由皮匠配底，一雙製成不但手續麻煩，而所費也相當可觀。</p>
<p>草製的要算最賤了，每雙不過二角左右，產自嘉定徐家行一帶，產地之人都賴以為生，原斜是以黃草編織而成，因其成本比較輕微，所以售價非常低廉，而穿進去也很滑爽，實是價廉物美之拖鞋。但滬上人士採用者却寥寥無幾，經售之店也少得很，還是出品少呢？還是穿了以為有損上海人之體面呢？那我們是不得而知。</p>
<h3>西瓜食譜</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>消暑解渴的食品，目前在市塲上面，雖然非常的多，允其是冷飮物品，充滿在都市的每一個角落裹，但在我以為西瓜還是最好的一種消暑食品。</p>
<p>不過吃西瓜也有各種不同的吃法，普通人家吃西瓜，每是把西瓜切成小塊分食。把大西瓜切成許多小塊，鮮甜的瓜汁要淌去不少，濕了整個的桌面，非常可惜。所以最好是把整個西瓜剖而為二，再用瓢羹挖取風瓤，這樣可不使瓜汁淌去。有人以為這樣的吃法，人少還好，人多就不配。然而我以為人多也可用瓢羹　在碗裹分食的。允其叉頭西瓜，放進嘴裏咬汁也要滴去不少，惟有用瓢羹吃最為經濟得法。</p>
<p>最近上海巳成冰的世界，電器冰箱，普通冰箱，中上之家，家各一具。家裏有了冰箱，什麽東西都要放在冰箱冰過，西瓜當然也不例外。冰凍的西瓜，果然格外冰冷，但我以為西瓜冰過了，為的太冷，進了嘴，失却原有美味。不若在剖食之前，用井水或自來水浸兩三小時，倒不會失去西瓜原有的甜美。</p>
<p>吃過西瓜，子和皮，一般的人家，每會隨手葉去，但會打算的人家，是不會棄掉的。把瓜子淘凈晒乾之後，不拘什麽時候，妙熟了放些鹽或淡吃，比南貨店買來的西瓜子要香脆得多。</p>
<p>不但西瓜子好吃，西瓜皮也可吃，如果你把外面的一層靑皮，留些內層的靑肉，用醬醬過了，成醬西瓜皮，用監醃過了，晒乾之後，成鹹西瓜皮，都可當早飯菜的。而且瓜皮加了油，或燉或燒，都可當素菜吃。聰明的主婦，更會利用瓜皮當葷菜的附頭。那麽不拘瓜子瓜皮，我們都可利用，隨手棄去，未免是不經濟了，允其在這瓜價很貴，百物奇昂的今日</p>
<h3>小菜籃子的時代</h3>
<p>— 之募</p>
<h3>閒話小房子</h3>
<p>— 阿紫</p>
<p>『小房子』這個名稱，在都市中是常常聽見的；『小房子』的組織，也是都市中特有的表現。道『小房子』，也可說是家庭的一個駢枝。</p>
<p>兩個男女熱愛同居，在不能公開的時光，名之曰『小房子』，帶有秘密的意味。</p>
<p>上海最普通的『小房子』，大的是兩個男女之外，用一個娘姨，借廂房，樓面，亭子間中的一間。</p>
<p>『小房子』的時間，好像並不怎樣長久的。最後的結果，不是分離，就是公開結合。變成了一個小家庭，或歸併到一個家庭中去。</p>
<p>『小房子』備有男主角愛吃的菜肴，及誘惑男主角流連忘返其家庭的野心與企圖。但是變成公開的小家庭也是女主角所希望的。</p>
<p>有一種『小房子』，是旅館式的：男女主角的定了一個時間，在此相聚，平日深閉，或派娘姨留守。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期的菜單中，筆者曾提出幾樣瓜類，所做的菜，料想讀者們已採用過了。本星期所要特別提出的，却是瓜類菜肴中最雋美而較名貴的一種，名呌冬風盅。讀者們凡是在夏季上過廣東菜館的，當然久聞其名，並且也早已嘗試過了。可是廣東菜館中的冬瓜盅，味兒雖美，代價却也可觀，大概吃一盅，非一二元不辦。筆者因為愛吃這樣菜，每年夏季，總得自己動手來做。買小冬瓜一個，去皮切去上部一小半，而以下面的大半隻應用，把所有的動全部挖去，然後將火腿丁，肉丁，香菌，邊失，筍衣，和以鹽料酒少許一並放進去，倘再放些鷄雜鴨雜在內，那是更好。這一切手續做好之後，再把鮮荷葉一張，（上海不易得鮮荷葉，可向藥店購買。）蓋在上面，然後隔水淸燉，燉到冬瓜酥透為止，吃起來十分鮮美，並且略帶荷葉的淸香，而湯汁之淸雋，更不用說了。吃完了盅內的東西，便可將冬瓜蘸醬油吃，因為鮮味已透入肉內，所以也比普通的冬瓜可口，讀者何妨如法泡製一下，一星期內吃一二次，也不能算浪費啊！</p>

<h3>罐頭食品製法</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>第一要件，須令罐頭全不洩氣，普通所製之罐，殊不可靠，宜在各方面之接合處，加以焊，錫，方可使用。熟食之品，可用防腐劑對全量百分之三至十，與食品充分混和，裝入罐錫，方可使用。熟食之品，可用防腐劑對全量百分之三至十，與食品充分混和，裝入罐內，密封其蓋，加熱至攝氏一百度以上，一百零五度以下，放冷之後，經過兩三個星期，以罐蓋不向外凸者為合格。如見凸起，則是防腐劑不足，宜在小試時，同裝十罐，九百分之三至十二為止，各加記號，經過霉天及三伏不變者，選定共一為標準，則不致蒙鉅大之損失矣。生食之品，不可加熱，須用抽空機抽出空氣，但非五六千金不辦。惟用冰與食鹽亦能殺滅其菌，即以冰塊擊碎，加三分之一之鹽，與之混和，入冰箱中，冰至攝氏零度以下，亦即可以久存，但必仍用防腐劑如上述之分別試騐方可。並在冰時，須有一罐全不用蓋，以便挿入寒暑表察其冷度，須在零度以下經過六小時後，方可取出。大凡用冰三份與鹽一份者，可以冷至零下二十一度，如用冰一份與鹽一份者，可冷至零下七十五度，故其殺菌之力其爲有效。若在無冰之處，則趁冬令有雪時，亦可用雪以代冰；吾則須用化學藥品為生寒劑，當視就地情形而定，以取廉便為宜。防腐劑製法，可向西藥房或原料行購硼酸粉及甘油以供自製，先以甘油三磅，加熱至攝氏一〇五度，後以硼酸粉二磅，徐徐加入，不絕攬拌，令水分完全蒸發，以至透明無澱爲度，試取一滴吹冷，能如玻璃狀呈脆性時，方為成功合格，即可直接溶入於食物之液愷中。如食物中本無液體不能化之，則先用水或酒精溶化，仍計算其固體量配用之。</p>
<p>（注意）凡欲製售，必須先經上述之小試，至少須能經過十個月後不變，方可認定一種實行製售，大凡罐頭食品，其銷塲並不在於落令之後，而在當令之先，例如立夏前之　魚，並未出水，而在市上已先出售，人皆以為時新初見之物，殊不知為冷藏之隔年品也。明乎此理，始可為之，吾則背時求售，其計左矣。故此一業，看似容易，但非有耐心毅力者不能成此恒業，蓋必三年而後有成也。但與十年樹木較，則可謂為速成。天下無難事，只在有心人，苟無恒心，則無恒業，一歲之中，何止百物，百試必有一成，只在有心人耳。</p>
<p>附寒暖計改算法：予普有一口訣，極極易憶，第一節只三句云：華氏改攝氏，先减三十二，乘五以九除。（例如華氏五十度，即攝氏十度也，）第二節亦只三句云：攝氏改華氏，乘九以五除，後加三十二。（例如攝氏一百度即華氏二百十二度也）（本篇為答羅驥超君而作）</p>

<h3>靈魂到底有無？（三續）</h3>
<p>— 竺</p>
<p>（5）人爲萬物之靈！萬物都沒有靈魂，只有人有靈魂，所以人能作萬物之靈，萬物之主人翁。空中之猛禽，山中之野獸，海中之鯨魚，雖然比人强大但是都被人制服。人又能利用水火風電爲人作工。更能研究天文地理，格知化學，歷史算學。這些都可證明人是有靈魂的，否則，那有這樣聰明？</p>
<p>（6）聖經證明人有靈魂的！起初上帝創造萬物之時，造植物，上帝不過糞夫牠生長出來。造動物是用泥土來造的。造人的身體也是用土來造，但是造好身體之後，又將自己的靈氣吹入在人的鼻孔裏，所以人就成了有靈魂的活人。（見聖經舊約創世紀一章二章）這又是證明人是有靈魂的。</p>
<p>（7）靈魂之結局如何？我們現在末脚要講到靈魂之結局：萬物都有結局，靈魂一定也有結局。人的生長魂是要停止和消滅的。譬如人道了邁年，髪褪，尺落，不能再長，身體各部只會衰老消瘦。知覺魂到了老年也要退步，眼目昏花了，耳朶聾鍾了，腦子遲鈍了。等到靈魂一出竅，生長魂和直覺魂完全消滅了，因爲這兩樣是寄附在身體上的，等到身體一壞，牠們就失去效力了，所以死人，你打他戳他，他都不痛。但是到那時靈魂還是整個存在，不過他脫離身體以後，還要有一個歸宿，若是沒有歸宿，就成了一個飄蕩無着落的遊魂，那末就被空中的惡靈（魔鬼）擄掠得去，成了牠的俘虜，受牠的虐待，將來末日還要與牠同歸於盡。</p>
<p>親愛的讀者阿，望你趕快投奔到達擬的上帝，救你的耶穌懷裏來罷！他必收納你！拯救你！愛護你到底。（此篇完了，以後有睱，再講天堂和地域。）　上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>混擾中的米市</h3>
<p>— （廷康）</p>
<p>限價米粒子細碎色澤黃糙　上白貨祗有價錢沒有發票</p>
<p>租界當局儘管出着限價的禁令，但米市塲的暗盤仍因囤戶的操縱而步步飛漲，高白粳已達三十元了，就是洋秈也要二十多元，於是人們恐惶着，心裹都起了個暗影，「不要又重踏二年前吃麵粉的時代啊！」事實上恐怖的程度在米舖子前很能看出一二的：</p>
<p>在一家米店裏，櫃台外擠着糶米人，但都買一斗八升的，因你要買一石五斗，大都回絕你說沒有存貨。我見一個老婆婆，拿着十元左右的錢顫抖地哀求着：「先生，我東凑西借的拼攏了錢，你做做好事，賣給我五斗吧。」可是米店夥虎起了臉，把頭搖得博浪鼓似的，那情形簡直比向他要飯還不加。但我明明聽得一會功夫電話來要五石，那個握筆管賬的對住聽筒說：「價錢算三十元，發票不出的，貨到就交錢，吾則原貨帶回一却是决貨，粒子細碎，米色黃。」這樣我就恍然爲什麼五斗糙。一石的不肯賣了。然而報上不</p>
<p>在擁擠的買客中，有的是是在請市民大家不耍買限價以在買當夜燒飯米，而看樣子似上的米嗎？有這樣情形，爲什麼不舉發呢？自然，有人情願出高價，吃上好白米。</p>
<p>叉有一家舖子，大家傳着價錢還公平，不過每人限制至多買五斗，不出送，於是門庭格外顯得擁擠，然而米乎小康之家預備積上一些以免米價再高的居多。</p>
<p>米市混沌着，人人在慌亂中，街頭巷尾，紛紛議論，都在說這樣下去，外匯會小到二辦士，金子會漲到六千元，而食米起碼要三十多元，於是人心格外慌亂了，囤戶拼命囤積居奇，殷實之家也囤積起來以免吃貴貨，受影響吃大虧的還是挨到貧苦人的身上，他們將怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>一般生活是在一天天苦下去了，而米價叉要暴漲到如此地步，這是在逼人走向為非作歹的路上去，賢明的當局應當從速把存米調查確實，（實際上我們確有足够的存米，而且立秋巳過，新穀即要登塲。）以有效的方法來强制執行那限價，這樣方能使市民安於生活。一方而還要囤米的發國難財朋友，請摸摸目己良心吧。</p>
<h3>舉辦舊貨義賣救難</h3>
<p>— 圓</p>
<p>在這物價飛漲的時候，中下階級的人們連自己生活尙覺勉强，再要負擔他人的生活費，自然是很難的。但覊居在「孤島」上的整萬難民，還有待於我們的救濟，因之，我提議最好能舉行一决舊貨義賣運動。</p>
<p>舊貨的範圍，包括日常的一切用品，譬如衣服，傢俱，書籍，文具，鞋，靴，以及面盆，手巾等零件等都是。由捐助人擬好價格出售，得款捐難民收容所，而售不完的貨物，也捐供難民日用。</p>
<p>這法子是非常經濟的。各人的家裏常常有許多用不着的東西，與其賤價賣給收舊貨的，叉何不捐出來為義舉呢？譬如衣服，現今競着流行服裝，高貴的太太小姐們，每一襲衣祇着一二次，就高置箱底，日久成為娘姨們的賞賜品，叉何不拿出來義賣，讓經濟情形較决的人們，得以較低的價格來置備衣着，而又讓難民得着實惠，一舉二得，何樂而不為呢？又如小孩生長速率極快，每年添製的衣服，假使設有弟弟妹妹可着，或有弟弟妹妹而不要着舊衣，要製新裝，那麽把舊衣拿出來義賣，不是也很好嗎？又如學校裏用的書籍，高價買來，售出不値一文，而且時常更改，除了有相差歲餘的弟妹，在同一學校的，可以應用外，其他的敎科書，簡直沒有大用，叉何不拿出來售給低年級的同學，自己尙去買高年級同學的書籍，成就義舉，賤價得書，又何樂而不為呢？</p>
<p>在若干日子的公開義賣結束以後，賣不完的，或有舊得不堪而人家不願買的，就點給難民收容所，發給難民日用，這樣便沒有一點廉費了。</p>
<p>本市有不少熱心公益的慈善家，希望大家起來合作，選舉熱心能幹正直廉潔的人做領袖，大家同盡義務，努力進行，使全體難能得蒙實惠，那這功德眞不小呀！</p>

<p>— 心近自巴黎寄</p>
<p>上海舉行於六月之古今柬帖展覽曾，包舉其他錢幣香烟片等　成品；洋洋乎蔚為大觀；予獨惜其遺漏歐戰後大陸諸邦之災鈔（Notgelder），致不旋踵而滬市以銅幣缺乏吿錢荒，滬人士渺無凖備，逆料此後繼郵票以替籌碼之代價券等物，一經國府規定辦法，國內藝術技術及廣吿學各專家，定可趁此機緣，起作學術上與工事上之出奇制勝。試看歐戰後紙廠與印刷工稱盛之奧國，所鐫製之彩色套印代價劵，因以昭示歷史色彩與地方精神者，何等精美。距今十六七年前之奧京維也納，且曾有戰災紙鈔展覽會（War－Notes－Market）之舉行。好勝之輩，窮極則通，謀利之方，無中生有，過期作廢之紙幣，一變而為鑑賞家爭先羅致之秘藏。凡事不失可乘之機，莫不令人破涕為笑。一之德國，且令紡織工業中心之更有進者，彼以工業稱雄於世一平蕪市（Biele－feld），發行織印兼施之綢片輔幣，點綴一九二一年之七百年市區成立紀念慶典；復令世界第二景德鎭之漫河（Meissen）市，範鑄瓷幣，一面有象徵荒業之圖，一面高揭市徽，瓷質潔白如蛋殼，瑩潤可愛，至若書業中心之菩提樹城，則用釘書取作簿面用之栗色厚紙版，印製電車上行用之紙質圓輔幣（參看附圖），堅韌不易破損，誠足為世界萬國之幣制史，別開生面者；不僅各國人士聞風而集之追求，聲價百倍，足令德人於飽經國難之餘，別開意外之利源也。至若郵票代籌碼之廣吿法門，有法國式人造明角（Mica）為面，薄鐵片為襯底之嵌郵票輕質小錢，方圓不等，錢背壓鑄市徽或商標，精湛玲瓏，足資取法。</p>
<h3>舞孃淚</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Panama　Lady”</p>
<p>「舞孃淚」是寫一個舞孃露茜的性愛和理智的衝突，劇木的編製技巧頗富於戲劇性。</p>
<p>全片的背景是南美的巴拿馬：小酒吧間中的形形色色，下等舞女的姿態，以及淸越的蛇聲，配着露茜的憂鬱和低沉的情調，導演者對於熱帶風光的渲染是很精緻動人的。</p>
<p>但是全片的調子太平穩，遲緩。譬如麥塔格偕露茜歸來，士女齊瑪暗置毒物於魚中，擬毒死露茜。及洛乘飛機追來和露茜相會兩塲戲，前者不够緊張（第二决的置放毒藥也無明顯的描寫）；後者露茜聽見飛機聲後，應該很快地衝出去，那樣淡淡然的在湖畔揮手歡迎，是不够狀出她心中積壓着的熱情的。同樣，在洛（飛機師）竊取煤油聲請登記書時，露茜的內心衝突沒有明顯地表演出來，因之執槍警吿洛，似乎有些突然。最主要的關鍵是在露茜和麥塔格同居在一個屋內之後，那種心竊愛之，而文懷戀着洛的矛盾心理沒有强烈地描寫出來，導演者所寫的優美情調祇是表面的，而沒有深入露茜心底內層。</p>
<p>最後露酋和麥塔格的同坐汽車，這結束是很聰明的。</p>
<p>露茜兒鮑爾的露茜，她祇是憂鬱而欠熱情，她的內心矛盾沒有做到收得攏，放得開的程度。亞倫蘭的麥塔格，也紙是做到穩健而已。</p>

<h3>After Days of Fierce Attacks by the Chinese Army, No Japanese Troops Remain East of Wuling in Jin Dong; Japanese Troops in Lishi Also Suffered Heavy Losses in Fierce Attacks; Chinese Troops on the East Bank of the Han River Launch Raids Against the Japanese Along the Hanyi Road</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Chinese forces have gained an advantage in the battle in central Hubei. The Chinese army on the Cambodian bank of the Han River is now continuously launching raids against the Japanese army along the Hanyi Highway. Chinese artillery units have continuously bombarded Japanese positions in Qianjiang over the past few days, hitting dozens of Japanese ammunition depots. To cope with the pressure from the Chinese army, the Japanese army has transferred troops from Yingcheng and Jingshan to reinforce. In the Lishi area of western Shanxi, the Japanese army has also suffered heavy losses from fierce Chinese attacks. Furthermore, Japanese troops in Fencheng, west of the Tongpu Railway, have also been surrounded by the Chinese army. Meanwhile, severe flooding has occurred in Zhengzhou, Henan, with many houses in the suburbs destroyed. At the same time, the actions of the Japanese army in Henan have also been greatly hampered. (American Associated Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>More than 2,000 Japanese troops, advancing on China from Tongguan via Qin County, Anze, and Huo County, have suffered heavy casualties after days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army. In the battle of Beipingzhen on the 8th, a large number of Japanese troops were annihilated. On the 10th, fierce fighting continued near Zhongyudian. Furthermore, after days of mopping-up operations by the Chinese army, there are no longer any traces of Japanese troops east of Dongwuling, west of Qinshui. (Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>Japanese troops in a certain area of Qianjiang have repeatedly been ambushed by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. Recently, three companies were transferred from Tianyue in an attempt to counterattack. On the morning of the 12th, more than 100 Japanese troops from Maojiachang were intercepted by a certain Chinese unit when they were marching to Dingjiadawan, resulting in a fierce battle. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the attack and urgently requested reinforcements from two companies to join the battle. While marching to Huangjialing, they were ambushed by the Chinese army, leading to another fierce battle. The Japanese troops also launched a fierce attack on a certain Chinese garrison, resulting in a day-long bloody battle. Due to heavy casualties, the Japanese troops took advantage of the darkness to flee back to Qianjiang City. In this battle, more than 80 Japanese soldiers were killed and more than 100 were wounded. Major Shibata, the first battalion commander of the Japanese regiment, was killed in action. Currently, the Japanese army is lying low in the city,不敢蠢动 (不敢蠢动). (Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>On the evening of the 4th, the Chinese army used mobile warfare tactics to suddenly surround Ximing Village, which is more than ten miles west of Taiyuan. The Japanese troops, caught off guard, did not resist and fled in all directions. More than 50 Japanese soldiers were killed, and more than 30 rifles and countless other military supplies were seized by the Chinese army. (Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>The Han River in Fancheng has slightly receded in recent days. Japanese troops in the lower reaches of the Xiang River are busy repairing fortifications. Although reinforcements arrived on the 9th after Japanese troops in Zhongxiang were attacked by the Chinese from all directions, the northern mountains are occupied by the Chinese army. Zhongxiang is still under Chinese control. (Dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) A reporter from the Central News Agency recently spoke with a certain commander overseeing operations in a certain area. According to him, more than 3,000 Japanese troops from Yicheng launched an offensive towards Qinshui starting on the 6th, with great momentum. The Chinese army, according to a pre-arranged plan, gradually lured and ambushed them. On the 9th, they advanced to an area advantageous to the Chinese forces and began to launch a counterattack against the Japanese with superior forces. A bloody battle unfolded in Shizhongao and Donggou (southeast of Yicheng). The Chinese army fought bravely and fiercely. By the 10th, the remaining Japanese troops, under pressure from the Chinese, were surrounded in the Zhangmacun and Shanggecun (southeast of Yicheng) area. The Chinese army then began a joint encirclement and suppression. After a day-long fierce battle, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses and desperately broke through the encirclement, fleeing in a very disheveled state towards Shijiazhuang (south of the Jicheng Avenue). After the Chinese cleared the battlefield, more than 500 Japanese corpses were left behind. In total, the Japanese army suffered casualties amounting to one-third of its total strength in the four-day battle. Currently, the Japanese troops in the Yicheng-Qinshui area have been completely cleared by the Chinese army. The commander went on to say that after the Chinese army's successive victories, their confidence in victory has become even stronger. The Japanese plan to "mop up" the Zhongtiao Mountains and Taihang Mountains has decisively failed, and the stronghold in southeastern Shanxi will become even more consolidated. (Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Japanese troops in Qin County, Shanxi, who invaded westward and captured the Chinese town of Guxianzhen, have been successively reinforced with more than 1,000 troops, hoping to join forces with the Japanese troops north of Changzhi to launch an offensive. Currently, they are confronting the Chinese army along the Wanjia Mountain (east of Qinyuan) line. (Dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) In eastern Shanxi, Japanese troops who invaded Dongyangguan on the 7th continued their westward advance. They were intercepted by the Chinese army at Xiangtangpu (west of Dongyangguan), and a fierce battle ensued. Finally, with the Chinese morale growing stronger, they fought bravely, and the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed eastward. The Chinese are currently in pursuit.

<h3>Captured Japanese Officers and Soldiers Organize Anti-Aggression War League; Inauguration Ceremony Held in Xi'an the Day Before Yesterday; Resolution to Telegraph the Japanese People to Rise Up Against the War</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) Prisoners of war in the  Prisoner of War Camp of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, in order to demonstrate their firm opposition to the war of aggression, specially organized the Datong Academy Anti-Aggression War League.

Firstly, the people of Chongqing have increased their knowledge of air defense. Secondly, information on air raids is more accurate than before. Thirdly, the number of air-raid shelters has greatly increased, sufficient for all citizens to seek refuge. Fourthly, the efficiency of the fire brigade has been enhanced. In the recent air raids by Japanese aircraft, at least seven out of every eight incendiary bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft failed to function, and the fire could be extinguished within half an hour.

<h3>Significant Progress in the Medical Undertakings of the Eighth Route Army; Mobile Medical Teams Accompany the Army to Perform First Aid Work; Mortality Rate of Guerrilla Forces Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Dr. Mukherjee, leader of the Indian National Congress, who is currently working in the Northwest Chinese Army, to the Associated Press reporter, the economic policy currently being implemented by the Eighth Route Army in northern Shaanxi is to make the countryside a completely self-sufficient economic unit. The border region government has now allocated 100,000 mu of land to various schools, agencies, and civil servants, ordering everyone to cultivate their own land for food, even children as young as ten years old. As for the farmers, they are now working hard to expand their cultivated land and increase production to achieve self-sufficiency. In the past three months, three large industrial cooperatives have been established in northern Shaanxi, engaged in the manufacture of cotton cloth and clothing. As for smaller-scale cooperatives, they are everywhere. According to Dr. Mukherjee, who has now returned from northern Shaanxi and intends to go to Hong Kong, other medical teams have left northern Shaanxi for the front lines. According to Dr. Mukherjee, there are currently 30 mobile medical teams there, coordinating with the combat of the guerrilla forces. Wherever there is combat, they go there. Therefore, wounded soldiers can receive preliminary first aid within half an hour of being injured. Then, they are transported to rear hospitals for surgery. After this is completed, they cross the river again into Shaanxi and enter sanatoriums for recuperation. Since the implementation of this mobile hospital, the mortality rate of the guerrilla forces has been greatly reduced. Before the establishment of this mobile hospital, wounded soldiers often died due to not being able to receive medical treatment early. Dr. Mukherjee also said that the medical schools in northern Shaanxi are also producing a remarkable number of medical talents. It is estimated that 100 doctors, 180 nurses, and 50 pharmacists who can undertake first aid work will graduate in mid-June of this year. It is said that by next year, another 80 fully trained doctors will graduate. Many of these are overseas Chinese from the Philippines, Malaysia, and Burma. After graduation, they can take on surgical and other work. Currently, there are 20 doctors in charge of medical affairs in rear hospitals, many of whom are students who studied in France, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union. In addition, northern Shaanxi has also established a pharmaceutical factory, whose output of medicines is sufficient for the needs of the Eighth Route Army. At the same time, the number of medical equipment seized by the Eighth Route Army from the Japanese army is also significant. Furthermore, according to Dr. Mukherjee, in mid-June, the Japanese army crossed the Yellow River at a ferry crossing 60 miles east of Yan'an. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese, the entire Japanese army crossing force of 600 men was annihilated. Currently, the morale of the people and troops in North China is extremely high.

<h3>Guangxi Cultural Organizations Telegraph Roosevelt, Praising the Abolition of the Commercial Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-eight cultural organizations in Guangxi today jointly telegraphed US President Roosevelt, praising Roosevelt's recent move to abolish the commercial treaty with Japan, considering it the most important step in opposing the aggression of dictatorial countries and promoting world peace. As for China's two years of resistance against Japan, the purpose is also to rebuild world peace. In order to thoroughly implement your ambition and policy of establishing world peace, we are determined to resolutely resist Japan to the end. However, we cannot help but say that although the US-Japan commercial treaty has been declared abolished, the cessation of Japan's cruel war and aggression against China still depends on the active actions of the United States. Therefore, we sincerely hope that you will decisively take further effective actions to stop Japan's aggression against China and ensure the interests of Americans in China.

<p>(Peiping) The anti-British agitation here has taken a new turn today. This morning, a Japanese aircraft flew very low over Dongjiaominxiang, dropping many anti-British leaflets in Chinese and English, with the words "Down with the British" and "Exclude the British." The British authorities immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese Embassy. The Japanese Embassy admitted that the aircraft may belong to the Japanese side and explained that the spontaneous anti-British sentiment among the Japanese people has now spread to the Japanese residents in China.

The company has now decided to give the employees a few days off, and they will return to work after the danger that may be caused by the second anniversary of the Shanghai War has passed. Therefore, the number of people who remain in service has indeed decreased. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Minimum Obligation of All Countries to the Far East</h3>
<p>Japan's aggression and China's resistance have continued for more than two years, with a long and uncertain future. This is the so-called current Far Eastern problem. In fact, it is by no means a temporary aberration that will pass with time, but a historical problem related to the past and the future. It is by no means a dispute between two countries, merely a matter of gains and losses, but a world problem related to the progress and decline of civilization and the ebb and flow of interests. It would be a great injustice to accuse the international community of indifference to this Far Eastern problem. To say that it has shared the burden but has not done so is not true. Have you not heard the remarks of Dr. Pirow, Minister of Defense of the Union of South Africa, on international phenomena? He believes that the conflict in Europe is unrelated to South Africa, but the evolution in the Far East cannot be viewed with indifference. He said that the prestige of white people in the countries of the Indian Ocean will fall to the ground with the Far East. As a result, South Africa may also suffer dangerous repercussions. This is not a matter for one country, but for the entire white race. These words were seen in the Reuters Johannesburg telegram截路 (jie lu) intercepted by this newspaper on the 12th. This consciousness is very commendable. Even South Africa, which is far from the Far East, has such a deep sense of response, which shows how other places and countries feel, and proves that the international community is not initially indifferent. The United States hates evil and sympathizes with China, but last month it sold more than 750,000 US dollars worth of airplanes to Japan. Objectively helping evil while subjectively hating it, actively abetting abuse while passively sympathizing with it. If the United States is like this, what about others? To say that it has already shared what kind of arduous task in this historical problem of the world problem, is it not far from the truth? Let's use righteousness to blame each other, and use strictness to admonish each other. To put it extremely sympathetically, most countries are worried about gains and losses, ambivalent, just as Chamberlain said that every time they read a report, their blood vessels dilate, but they still do not have the courage to correct it, nor have they made a plan for liquidation. This is the truth.</p>
<p>China expects all countries to abide by the various international treaties they have signed, fulfilling their sacred obligations to the treaties, taking practical actions to give play to the spirit of general international principles, being consistent in word and deed, and striving to live up to their past declarations and promises. All member states of the League of Nations should sincerely abide by the League of Nations' goals and the various resolutions of its General Assembly and Executive Council. According to common sense, China certainly has the right to make such requests, and reasonable requests are not excessive expectations. But the facts show that the righteous people recognize the rationality of China's requests, and even make generous voices of support based on reason and righteousness. The cowardly dare not even mention this. The cold-hearted utter these words and show their contempt. Others attribute it to being impossible or beyond their power. Even on the Chinese side, in view of the general trend, it has compromised and sought perfection, not "according to what can be based on, arguing for what must be argued for." This explains why the Chinese representative at the League of Nations meeting does not use reasonable requests as the standard for requests, and still places the obtained requests under reservation.</p>
<p>However, China compromises and seeks perfection, China does this because it regards self-restraint as a virtue. Should the international community insult and destroy it for this reason! The international community is indeed full of crises, and each country indeed has its own internal difficulties. Regarding this Far Eastern problem, which is related to history and the world, it is indeed impossible to meet the reasonable standard and fulfill its obligations. However, there should also be a minimum standard and fulfill its minimum obligations. In other words, whatever should be done, even if it cannot be done, what should not be done should absolutely not be done.</p>
<p>What should not be done? Countries that cannot stop aggression should not abet aggression. Countries that cannot correct the errors of aggression should not recognize the facts of the errors. Countries that cannot effectively assist China's resistance should not obstruct China's resistance. Countries that cannot share the responsibility for stabilizing the Far East should not increase the root of the Far East's disaster. Judging by examples, supplying airplanes, weapons, and other military supplies to aggressor nations is directly abetting aggression. Allowing the sale of goods from aggressor nations in the market, so that aggressor nations can obtain resources to purchase instruments of aggression, is indirectly abetting aggression. Such as the so-called Shanghai Customs Agreement, such as the so-called Tokyo Preliminary Agreement, such as the so-called military needs, such as transferring Tianjin suspects to the so-called local authorities, this is recognizing the facts of the errors. The strength of China's resistance does not depend on a few tens of millions of silver dollars, but sidelining a silver dollar is the equivalent of weakening China's resistance. Deliberately weakening the resistance is no different from obstructing resistance. The stability of the Far East depends on our fixing the theory and facts of aggression. To abet aggressive behavior and recognize erroneous facts is to reward aggression. What difference is there between this and actively supporting the root of disaster in the Far East? All these matters, some have already been done, some are about to be done, or some intend not to do but have not been able to resolutely reject. Whether the reasons given are for reasons of necessity, for profit, for safety, for peace, or for domestic politics and law, it is without a doubt that they should not be done in the Far East, in the international community, in history, and in human civilization! Today, if it is said that all countries must do what they should do, this is in theory, in morality, and even in international law, although it is not an extravagant hope, although it is not extravagant words, but in fact it is close to extravagant hope, close to extravagant words. But to absolutely not do what should not be done, is this not the minimum preparation? Is it not also the minimum obligation of all countries to the Far Eastern problem?</p>
<h3>Regarding Negotiations on the Tianjin Case: Britain Clarifies Its Position; Economic Issues Extend Beyond Local Scope; Willing to Resolve Police Issues Amicably</h3>
<p>(London) Tokyo Dispatch: Regarding the issue of North China currency and Tianjin silver reserves, if it is not resolved concurrently with the issue of Tianjin police administration, the Japanese government will refuse to continue negotiations with Britain. Government sources here do not confirm this statement and take the opportunity to clarify Britain's firm position as follows: (1) The circulation of Chinese legal tender in North China and the issue of Tianjin silver reserves extend beyond the local scope, involving other countries, especially France, making it inappropriate for Britain and Japan alone to resolve. (2) Regarding the Tianjin police issue, the British government is still willing to base its approach on the Tokyo Plan (referring to the initial agreement between Britain and Japan) and reach an amicable solution with the Japanese government. (3) The transfer of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case does not imply legal recognition of the "Chinese authorities" in Tianjin. The British side has always considered this matter from a purely judicial perspective. In other words, if the Japanese side can provide sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the suspects, the British government is willing to handle the matter according to local regular procedures. This point was stated at the very beginning of the Tianjin case. (12th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Embassy Military Attaché Major General Biggs visited Major General Mutō at the Kaikōsha at 4 PM on the 13th, expressing sincere appreciation for the return of the Japanese military representative stationed in Tianjin. (13th, Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports, the Japanese military officer who participated in the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference in Tianjin is scheduled to return by plane tomorrow to resume military affairs, as the final instructions from the British side have not yet arrived. It is reported that Major General Mutō, the leader of the Japanese military delegation, stated that the conference could not be further delayed, and police and economic issues could not be separated, so it was not appropriate to consider them separately as requested by the British side. (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent stated today that Katō, the chief Japanese representative to the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference, refused British Ambassador Craigie's request to resume talks based on recent instructions received from the British government, saying that London had not received confirmation of this matter, but even if this statement is accurate, it is not surprising. He also said that the talks between the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the Tianjin security incident have reached the point of nearing a compromise, modeled on the police organization of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Shanghai Municipal Council is now predominantly occupied by American citizens. Japanese observers can see in Shanghai the public concession police department's diligence in curbing anti-Japanese activities. The British side has expressed that similar measures can be taken in Tianjin. In the eyes of the British, the new instructions from the British government to Craigie are likely to achieve a compromise. If the Japanese side had not mixed this purely Anglo-Japanese matter with external issues involving other powers, the entire Anglo-Japanese talks could have proceeded smoothly. (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Prominent figures from all walks of life in Britain sent a telegram to Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, advocating that the British Consular Court in Shanghai invoke habeas corpus for the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin. The British branch of the International Peace Conference has recently issued a statement in support, stating that the legality of the government's decision to hand over the four Chinese suspects is questionable, as it is tantamount to acknowledging the "Chinese authorities" in Tianjin under Japanese control. Therefore, before the transfer of the accused, the people of the country should send letters and telegrams to Foreign Secretary Halifax urging him to pay attention. (12th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan醞釀閣潮　加入德義同盟問題　平沼板垣意見衝突</h3>
<h3>Japan Brewing Cabinet Crisis: Issue of Joining the German-Italian Alliance; Hiruma and Itagaki Clash in Opinions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) There is a risk of a cabinet crisis in Japan. The Japanese army is now insisting on concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy. If the cabinet faced this difficult problem in peacetime, it could resign and let a new cabinet resolve it. However, in the current international situation, if it resorts to resignation, it would be enough to expose Japan's weakness, so it is quite difficult. Foreign Minister Arita is now drafting a counterproposal to be submitted for discussion at the next meeting of the Five Ministers. According to reports, Army Minister Itagaki advocated at the last meeting of the Five Ministers on Friday to immediately join the German-Italian military alliance, but the other four ministers (including Hiruma) opposed the proposal. According to reports, the Japanese cabinet decided twice in mid-May and mid-June that the conditions for Japan to join the German-Italian military alliance could only be met when dealing with Soviet aggression. As for wars between Germany and Italy and other countries other than the Soviet Union, Japan could only provide political, financial, and commercial assistance to Germany and Italy. However, these conditions were not approved by Germany and Italy at the time. Judging from the current situation, if Japan's assistance to Germany and Italy can only stop there, then Germany and Italy will naturally not be able to force Japan to take further actions. However, the Japanese army is now trying its best to increase Japan's obligations to Germany and Italy. According to sources close to the Japanese government, Hiruma resolutely opposes Japan's full participation in the German-Italian military alliance. Hiruma can only agree to a military alliance to deal with the Soviet Union and opposes concluding a military alliance to fight against democratic countries. Navy Minister Yonai also opposes the army's proposal, as after the establishment of a military alliance with Germany and Italy, the Japanese navy may have to fight in areas outside the Western Pacific. As for Arita's counterproposal, it will likely be submitted on Tuesday of this week. His position is still the same as the previous cabinet's decision, but in terms of wording, he plans to find ways to satisfy the army's desires. As for the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, both Hiruma and Arita are deeply convinced that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement. If this point can be achieved, then the army's proposal to join the German-Italian military alliance can of course be rejected. (12th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiruma told visiting journalists today that the government will respond to the European situation based on the policy decided on June 6. The government has now issued an order so that methods can be prepared based on the results discussed at the Five Ministers meeting on August 9. The Five Ministers meeting will continue this week. The Prime Minister also stated that the Anglo-Japanese conference has nothing to do with the government's European policy. The government's European policy will proceed based on the established policy. Regarding the cabinet's decision on June 6, no public announcement was made, but it is generally believed that at that time, it only agreed to provide limited assistance to the Axis powers.

<h3>Italian Consul in Hong Kong Denies Reported Remarks</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Italian Consul General to Hong Kong, who is currently in Tokyo, formally denied today the remarks he made when interviewed by Japanese reporters, as reported in Japanese newspapers. The interview with Mr. Mei was published in the Japanese Guangzhi Bao and other newspapers, stating that Mr. Mei told Japanese reporters that Hong Kong's defenses were very weak and that the Japanese navy could easily seize it within thirty minutes. He also said that the anti-British movement within China was growing rapidly and had an adverse impact on the security of Hong Kong, and that he believed the British had despaired of Hong Kong's defenses. Mr. Mei has now firmly denied that he made such remarks and said that the reporter may have misunderstood his words due to language barriers, resulting in this error. (12th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin: Rising River Levels</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Tianjin Dispatch: The water level of various rivers in the Tianjin area continued to rise on the 11th and 12th. Beidaguan and Dahuotang in the urban area have been flooded. The water in the Hai River in the Japanese Concession has reached the bank. The water level in the British and French Concessions is less than a foot from the bank. The urban area and the Japanese Concession have the lowest terrain. If the upstream rain continues, they will be the first to be submerged. The Japanese puppets are panicked day and night. Besides pulling labor to transport materials for flood prevention, there is no other good plan. The authorities of the British and French Concessions have also built earthen dams on the riverbank and piled sandbags at the junction with the Japanese Concession to guard against any eventuality.

<h3>Germany and Italy Support Each Other; Attempting to Transform Europe; Striving for So-Called Rights Vital to Survival; Foreign Minister of Italy Returns to Rome After Talks</h3>
<p>Salzburg: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano boarded a plane at 2 PM and returned to Rome. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also returned to his villa in the nearby town of Fuschl for rest. It is generally said here that it is normal for the foreign ministers of the two countries to meet, and there is no need to issue a communiqué. This decision to talk was made because the current situation in Europe requires a review of various necessary measures. The results of the discussions have resulted in an agreement. It is possible that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini may meet elsewhere in the future, but now is not the time. (13th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The talks between Hitler and his Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano began at 2:30 PM today and lasted for three hours and forty-five minutes. The talks took place in the German Führer's tea room on the Kehlstein mountain near Berchtesgaden. There is a cave that leads to the mountain, and visitors enter the mountain through the cave and then take an elevator directly to the mountain. This decision to talk is related to war and peace. After the talks, officials announced that discussions would continue tomorrow. Ciano and Ribbentrop returned to their hotel in Salzburg and went to the theater to watch a Shakespearean play. Diplomatic officials from Germany and Italy had preliminary talks at Ciano's residence in Salzburg this morning. Shortly after, the German Foreign Minister rushed to Berchtesgaden to report to Hitler on the nine-hour discussion he had with Ciano yesterday. According to German newspapers, the Danzig issue will be the main event in the current talks. According to those close to Ciano, the rumor that Italy intends to persuade Germany to ease tensions is completely inaccurate. At the same time, German spokespersons did not make alarming remarks, and there was no news other than the declaration of close cooperation between the two Axis countries. (12th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the talks between the German authorities and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the newspapers here all said that the two sides do not value empty talk, but emphasize practical action. The Nazi Party's official newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter, stated, "What is being discussed here is not limited to the fate of the Free City of Danzig, but rather the desire to eliminate the unfair treatment stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles and replace it with the rights vital to the survival of free nations, thereby establishing a new order for Europe." The Fränkischer Kurier stated, "The agreement between Germany and Italy has been established for a long time. What is being discussed now is not the issue of cooperation. Cooperation is merely the natural basis for the talks between the two sides." Other newspapers said that this decision to talk is not to establish an agreement, but to prepare "practical decisions." (13th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent claimed that Europe will obviously be tense for several weeks thereafter. Germany seems to be putting pressure on Hungary to conclude a military alliance with it, so that Germany can obtain the right to pass through Hungarian territory to attack the side of Poland and attack from Ruthenia. "On the other hand, Germany will undoubtedly agree to help Hungary make territorial demands on Romania. The correspondent continued, "Even if Germany threatens Hungary with an attack, it is not certain that it can force the Hungarian government to take this path, because Hungarian Regent Horthy and Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki are both determined leaders." (13th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The newspapers here commented on the meeting between the diplomatic officials of Germany and Italy in Salzburg, emphasizing the discipline of the Axis powers to deal with Poland's provocations and the preparation for war by the democratic countries. Regarding the Danzig incident, moderate opinions in the Salzburg meeting seem to prevail over military opinions. The Roman newspaper Roma Elettronica published an article by Ansado, which stated that preserving peace in the general situation in Europe requires great deliberation. The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia stated that Europe is now searching for solutions to avoid war. (12th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano conducted talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg yesterday and paid a visit to Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden. Members of the Fascist Party here said that the German-Italian military alliance treaty (signed on May 12 of this year) originally stipulated that the authorities of the two signatory countries could exchange opinions in times of tension. Therefore, this matter is a matter of course and has no special significance. As for what was discussed, there are four main issues: (1) the Danzig issue, (2) the issue of joining the German alliance, (3) the issue of Germany and Italy strengthening ties with Spain, (4) countries that express sympathy to the German-Italian axis, especially Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, should take the German-Italian axis as the center and politically organize to resist the encirclement policy. Regarding the first issue, Führer Hitler and the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy did not make any concrete decisions after the talks. On the contrary, they conducted a "peaceful" review of the matter and considered various "natural solutions." Regarding the second issue, what Germany and Italy discussed was what impact Japan's participation would have on the relationship between Germany and Italy and Britain. Regarding the third issue, Fascist Party members only said that when a war occurs in the future, Spain's position is extremely important, and relations must be promoted. Regarding the fourth issue, Fascist Party members believe that even if Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria do not follow in the footsteps of Germany and Italy, they at least hope that their attitude can be harmonious with the Berlin-Rome axis. In short, "The situation in Europe is out of balance, and various issues in the Danube and Balkan Peninsulas and Eastern Europe urgently need clarification." Therefore, the governments of Germany and Italy may invite representatives from Central and Eastern European countries to conduct talks. (12th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Covets Danzig; Repeats the Old Tricks of Annexing Czechoslovakia; Claims That the German Minority Cannot Withstand Oppression; German Newspapers Change Their Tone, Showing Government Authorization</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding German-Polish relations, German newspapers have recently changed their tone, raising the issue of the German minority in Poland and acknowledging that the current situation is similar to the Sudetenland issue last year. This is obviously authorized by the government. The Essen National Daily (the organ of Air Force Minister General Göring) stated, "Germany has accepted the responsibility of protecting Germans abroad. Now that Germans are being oppressed in neighboring countries, Germany cannot stand idly by." The Angriff used a large headline stating, "There have been as many as 430 incidents of Poles attacking Germans, resulting in bloodshed." The Frankfurter Zeitung stated, "The Polish government almost wants to provoke a crisis. The path it is following is the path that Beneš (the former president of Czechoslovakia) planned to take last year. At that time, only because Western European countries were not yet prepared for something, and because Führer Hitler was determined to level Czech fortifications, Beneš eventually failed. If a war does occur at this time, if Germany does not win, it must accept a peace treaty more severe than the Treaty of Versailles. Germans know very well which one to choose between the two. Checking Poland's founding is bound to endanger European peace in the long run. This error must be corrected in any way." The Abendpost stated, "Germany's patience also has its limits, and this is what Poland should understand." The phrase "in any way" was used by Führer Hitler when dealing with the Czech issue last year. German newspapers have recently cited it, which is another point that the German-Polish relationship is similar to the Sudetenland issue last year. (12th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Danzig Nazi Party Members Hold Demonstrations; Forster Warns Britain and France; No Intervention in Danzig Affairs Allowed</h3>
<p>Twenty thousand Danzig Nazi Party members recently held a demonstration here. The party leader, Forster, delivered a speech, reiterating the determination of Germany and the Free City of Danzig to merge, and vehemently criticized Britain, France, and Poland for opposing this matter. He said that Britain and France failed to resolve the Danzig issue according to the wishes of the citizens at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. "The Free City of Danzig hereby declares to Britain and France that the affairs of these countries are none of its business. The future of the City of Danzig, whether directly or indirectly, has nothing to do with Britain and France. It is only Britain and France who are inciting Poland to oppose Germany and the City of Danzig. However, the authorities in Britain and France must know that blood relations are stronger than forcibly accepted treaties. As for the majority of Poles being illiterate, they should be forbidden from engaging in all political activities. This will definitely be beneficial to Europe. In short, Führer Hitler already has the most powerful army in the world and will definitely be able to merge the Free City of Danzig into Germany." (12th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Tone; Overbearing</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are now gradually adopting an overbearing tone. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" and the "Hamburgischer Correspondent" both published lengthy editorials, saying that if a war occurs, Britain should be held responsible. General commentators are advising Britain to change its course quickly and not place the fate of Europe in the hands of an irresponsible Poland. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" stated that there are places in world history that need to be revised, and this revision will soon occur. Those who do not see this must be blind. The "Hamburgischer Correspondent" stated that Germany does not want to delay any longer the only natural solution to extremely simple problems such as Danzig. German and Italian newspapers all said that this decision to talk in Berchtesgaden will not produce unexpected results and refuted the rumor that Italy is not enthusiastic about the Axis. There is a rumor that Danzig Nazi Party leader Forster met with Hitler yesterday. (12th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Seeks Italian Assistance; So That Plans Can Be Realized</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The talks between the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in Salzburg have recently been commented on by various observers, all of whom said that the German-Italian axis may be about to take action. This talk was a prior exchange of views. This can be seen from various signs: Germany's fierce attacks on Poland, Germany's active recruitment of workers and conscription of reservists, military vehicles visible everywhere in Berlin, and strict restrictions on the amount of gasoline used by private individuals. Among political figures, there are differing views. Some say that the German authorities are making German-Polish relations tense during Foreign Minister Ciano's visit in an effort to make Italy agree to provide unconditional assistance to Germany. Others believe that Germany not only wants to obtain Italian assistance on the Danzig issue, but also wants Italy to help it realize its plans in the Balkan Peninsula. What are the plans? That is, to revise the Treaty of Trianon (the Treaty of Peace with Hungary in the European War) and the Treaty of Saint-Germain (the Treaty of Peace with Austria in the European War). Regarding this, the Nazi Party's official newspaper, the Angriff, revealed clues in an article published yesterday. It is rumored that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop once proposed to Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky that he would be willing to use his full strength to assist Hungary in making demands for the revision of the peace treaty, but on the condition that Hungary be politically and economically controlled by Germany. In addition, there is now one point that is undoubtedly true: in addition to its ambitions in the Balkan Peninsula, Germany's coveting of Poland is no longer limited to the City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. This can be seen from the fact that German newspapers have been vigorously saying that Germany is responsible for protecting the German minority in Poland and that the coal produced in Poland's Upper Silesia Province and the Olsa region (which Czechoslovakia ceded to Poland last September) should belong to Germany.

<h3>UK, France and Soviet Union Continue Staff Talks, Germany Sends Personnel to Moscow to Monitor Development, Poland Denies Participation to Avoid Providing Excuse for German Aid</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The first phase of staff talks between the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union was held this morning, with the aim of establishing a military agreement between the three countries. The representatives participating in the talks were all naval, land, and air force officers. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Representatives from the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union resumed military talks this morning, lasting three hours. Subsequently, at the suggestion of the British representative, it was decided to hold two talks daily until the conclusion. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times recently declared, "As the Foreign Ministers of Italy and Germany are conducting talks in Salzburg, Germany, the practical cooperation between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union is also becoming closer, as representatives from the respective General Staffs have begun talks in Moscow. The future relations between these countries will depend on the outcome of the secret talks among these naval and land army experts. As for the negotiations on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between these countries, they have already progressed to a point where they can be temporarily suspended, and we can wait for the military representatives of these countries to discuss practical defense issues. When the military delegations from the United Kingdom and France arrived in Moscow, they were warmly welcomed by the Soviet side and immediately began work without even warming their seats. This shows that there is hope for the success of these talks." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Evening Post recently reported that the German government has decided to send General Syrový, the former Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, to Moscow to monitor the progress of the staff talks between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. General Syrový originally served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Czechoslovakian Army, and succeeded Hodža as Prime Minister during the tense situation in Czechoslovakia last year. He has now joined the service of Führer Hitler. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The staff representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have begun talks in Moscow. Political figures here are paying close attention to this matter, as it is directly related to Poland. It is rumored that Poland intends to send a military delegation to Moscow to participate in the talks. The Polish government has denied this, intending to express its strict neutrality in order to avoid Germany using this as an excuse to accuse Poland of participating in an encirclement policy, and to leave room for a friendly solution to the disputes between Germany and Poland. However, when the military representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union discuss the issue of aiding Poland, Poland will have to send representatives to participate. The person chosen may be the military attaché of the Soviet Embassy, and it should be kept secret. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>Large Turkish Army Concentrated on Border with Bulgaria, States Intention Is Not Against Bulgaria, Romanian King Returns Home from Turkey</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria Local newspapers have been publishing vigorous articles criticizing the rumor that Turkey is massing a large army in Cıralas, its European territory. In the past twenty-four hours, the tone has suddenly changed, saying that there are no disputes between Bulgaria and Turkey, and that the two countries fought together in the European War, and have always been friendly. It is now believed that this is because Turkey issued a public statement announcing that this decision to conduct large-scale maneuvers is not directed against Bulgaria, and because Turkey invited the Bulgarian military attaché stationed in Turkey to observe the maneuvers.

<p>Bucharest, Romania King Carol II has returned here after holding talks with Turkish President İsmet at the Port of Istanbul. He immediately convened a cabinet meeting to report on the talks, stating briefly that, regarding the various issues in the Balkan Peninsula, he agreed to the territorial demands that Bulgaria may make (Note: Dobruja in Romania belonged to Bulgaria before the European War).

Farley has just had contact with the Polish government authorities, and will certainly take the opportunity to inquire about the opinions of Italian officials on various major international issues. In addition, key figures in the Roman Curia will certainly inform him of the Vatican's efforts to improve relations between the Axis powers and the democratic countries, as well as certain countries guaranteed by the United Kingdom and France. Regarding this, Bishop Cortesi, the Vatican's ambassador to Poland, recently returned to the Vatican capital, and Bishop Orsenigo, the Vatican's ambassador to Germany, recently returned to the Vatican capital to meet with the Pope. The visit of Cardinal Gasparri, a confidant of the Pope, to the United States is also noteworthy. (Havas, 12th)</p>

The statement strongly criticized Jingwei's actions and stated that the Chinese journalists in Shanghai "have always demonstrated their determination to support the national policy of resistance during the past two years." The statement also urged the Shanghai journalists to maintain their traditional journalistic position and not to fear "the threat of assassination and bombing." It also stated that the reason why the Shanghai citizens rejected the government established by the Japanese was due to the efforts of the Chinese journalists, and therefore the Chongqing journalists should fully support their colleagues in Shanghai in the future.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Volunteers from Malaya Return to Motherland to Serve, The Eighteenth Batch Leaves Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore The eighteenth batch of service corps returning to China, including 350 overseas Chinese automotive mechanics and drivers from Malaya, has now left Singapore. In total, more than 2,000 overseas Chinese volunteers from Malaya have gone to the front lines in China. This batch of overseas Chinese came from all parts of Malaya, and several came from Java. They are named the Third Malayan Mechanical Team. Nine fifteen-year-old Singaporean students, including several sons of businessmen, also departed with the team to enter military schools in Jiangxi. These Malayan youth volunteers sacrificed their excellent careers and comfortable and safe lives, generously setting out to help their motherland. The leader of the team was the head mechanic in a major European automobile company, with a monthly salary of 30 pounds, and he has also resigned to return to his country. The Chinese Relief Fund Committee arranged everything for the volunteers and paid for their travel expenses. Before departure, they all underwent physical examinations and received several months of training. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Huang Xuchu Tours Various Districts, Plans to Develop National Economy, and Inspects Various Bombing Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence The provincial governor, Huang Xuchu, believes that Guizhou province is the base of resistance against Japan. For the past two years, the manpower and material resources contributed to the country have been enormous. In the future, all construction in the province should be doubled. How to increase production, develop the national economy, and promote political progress must be personally inspected in various counties, in order to make thorough plans. Moreover, after the major cities have been bombed many times, the people have been displaced and urgently need to be settled and consoled. Therefore, he took the opportunity of the tour to inspect the disaster areas. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to the deputy commanders of the various people's corps and the county magistrates, informing them of the itinerary. It is reported that the itinerary is scheduled to depart from Guilin on the 10th of this month, first to the counties in the Liuqing District. Because when Liuzhou was bombed on the 16th of last month, 400 residents were killed or injured, the entire Longcheng Middle School was destroyed, injuring two female students, and more than 200 shops and houses were destroyed. Staff officer Shi of the Liuzhou People's Corps Command, Secretary General Wang Ji, and clerk Feng Yijun were all killed in the bombing. Since the war of resistance, Liuzhou has been bombed more than 20 times, and this bombing was the most devastating. After arriving in Liuzhou, Chairman Huang plans to first comfort the disaster-stricken people and try to provide relief, and then inspect the militia affairs, civil administration, reclamation, and various constructions. He will stay in Liuzhou for several days, and then transfer to Qingyuan (Yishan County), and then to the Yongning District. After the inspection of the counties in the Yongning District is completed, he will travel upstream along the Zuo River to inspect the Longzhou District. Longzhou is located in the upper reaches of the Zuo River. The Yonglong section of the railway is currently under construction, and the roadbed has been completed one after another. At the latest, the track can be laid by the end of this year. After the Yonglong Railway is built, it can run from Guilin to Zhennanguan, and connect with Annam, which will add a lot of strength during the long-term resistance against Japan. Chairman Huang's trip to Longzhou also pays special attention to the inspection of transportation. Next is the inspection of the Baise District. Baise is adjacent to Yunnan and can enter Yunnan's Guangnan Mengzi via the highway, reaching Kunming. Now, due to the connection of the Yunnan-Burma Road, Kunming has become an important transportation hub in the southwest. Since the Baise line can reach Kunming, Baise can also indirectly benefit from transportation. Baise is located in the upper reaches of the You River. Chairman Huang plans to return to Yongning from Baise after inspecting the Zuo River, or go down the Xun River and Yulin Wuzhou from Yongning. Huang's trip is expected to take two months. During the tour, the affairs of the provincial government were ordered to be temporarily handled by Huang Zhongyue, the Director of the Department of Finance. It is also heard that Huang's scheduled inspection items are divided into five departments: General Affairs, Politics, Economy, Military Affairs, and Literature. After the inspection of the various districts is completed, the above five departments will be submitted to the provincial affairs meeting for detailed planning and active construction, so as to meet the needs of the long-term resistance against Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Officer Stationed in Kunshan Collapses from Poisoning, Kashiwagi Receives Banquet in Jiaozhi, The Feast is Prepared by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence Kashiwagi, the captain of the Japanese military police garrisoned in Kunshan, went to Jiaozhi on the 7th of this month to inspect the garrisoned troops. That evening, the Japanese officers in the area held a banquet to welcome him. Unexpectedly, halfway through the feast, Kashiwagi suddenly collapsed with abdominal pain, and the banquet ended unhappily. He was transported back to Kunshan by Japanese military boat that night, and was admitted to the Puji Hospital in the county for treatment. After diagnosis by the Japanese military doctor, it was believed that he was poisoned. It is said that he is in critical condition, but the feast that was prepared was prepared by the Japanese army, so the reason for the poisoning will become a riddle.</p>
<h3>Will British Authorities Attempt to Bribe the Japanese? Observations from Economic and Financial Experts. British Policy Towards Japan Riddled with Mistakes. Japan Will Use Funds to Consolidate Financial Standing. Once Financial Standing is Solidified, They Will Certainly Cause Trouble for Britain.</h3>
<p>The following is written by John Ahlers, a local expert on economic and financial issues, and appears in this issue of the "Millard's Review." It can be seen as echoing the London dispatch written by "Shu Di" that was published in this newspaper a few days ago. According to a London cable yesterday, the British government has decided to extradite the four Chinese suspects in the assassination case of Mr. Cheng in Tianjin. Refusal to extradite the four was the primary cause of the Tianjin blockade. Having come to this point today, why didn't they act differently from the start? Britain has been yielding to Japan step by step. The bribery mentioned in this article is likely to become a reality. If the Japanese use these funds to consolidate everything they have gained by force in China, wouldn't Britain be indirectly at odds with China! However, the British public is definitely not entirely asleep. From a common sense perspective, they will not necessarily follow the foolish and senile authorities on the road to suicide.</p>
<p>—Translator—</p>
<p>The "ghost" of a financial arrangement between London and Tokyo is now walking again. This move may seek to facilitate or conclude political deals between the two island empires. The reappearance of this specter has been widely discussed in major Japanese financial circles recently, and London is also paying close attention. Some believe it is a nightmare, while others believe it is a familiar sign encouraged by hope.</p>
<p>If the public believes that all the news released by Britain and Japan regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo and elsewhere is just news and nothing more, then they are being too naive. In all countries in our era, large, small, old, and new, secret diplomacy is once again singing a song of victory. The internal facts of the Tokyo negotiations are carefully kept from the public by the participants. These facts may not be fully disclosed for decades to come, at which time there may be further talk of the British attempting to bribe the Japanese again.</p>
<p>Although Chamberlain and Lord Halifax enjoy the respect they deserve, they cannot convince us that they personally control the London government and formulate British policy. We have the same level of belief in Hiranuma and Arita controlling the Tokyo government and formulating Japanese policy, or the Shanghai Municipal Council controlling Shanghai affairs. These great gentlemen are merely spokesmen for gentlemen who wish to wield even greater power behind the scenes. The "Hiranuma-Arita Company" has shrunk into an agent of the Japanese militarists, while the "Chamberlain-Halifax Company" only handles the political affairs of the City of London.</p>
<p>The real power holders in both countries are the Japanese militarists and the City of London, who have provided ample evidence of their unfortunate facts in recent years: they have forgotten much, and they know very little. They are both committed to major superstitions and often seem oblivious to common sense. The Japanese militarists firmly believe that large-scale massacres and destruction can create a new world for their enjoyment, while the top-hatted financiers of London cling to the idea that they can maintain their old, well-managed world simply by cleverly lending money. The Japanese militarists are unaware that they will ultimately destroy themselves, while the London financiers are not afraid that they may eventually reach bankruptcy along a smoothly paved road. Tokyo's belief is supported by bayonets, while London's belief that it can bind others with golden ropes remains unshaken.</p>
<p>There are many agents in London and Tokyo, either commissioned or volunteering, working hard to bring Britain and Japan together again. The idea behind this effort is very simple. If both countries are focused on building a new world, and if each country holds different views of that world, then there is no hope of reaching an understanding. However, the fact that only Japan needs a new situation today, while Britain wishes to maintain the status quo, has clearly opened up a perspective for some kind of arrangement between the two countries. Intermediaries estimate that they can find the minimum extent that Japan will be satisfied with, and then they can use the maximum concessions that Britain is willing to make to reach this limit.</p>
<p>Because the two lines drawn never meet, this has created the current dispute between Britain and Japan, and British money is flowing in here. Britain is rich with the money that Japan desperately needs. London certainly does not want to provide Japan with funds to continue the war, but the agents will say: the City of London is prepared to assist the Japanese in consolidating everything they have seized by force and making it profitable, as long as the Japanese stop continuing to plunder British interests. This suggestion greatly excited the Japanese financial community, because they were already tired of the war and now wanted to achieve results, results that would be expressed in higher figures on the profit and loss accounts of Japanese private capitalism.</p>
<p>Bribing Japanese bayonets with British pounds, seeking only temporary peace, is also a contributing factor. This is not a new idea. A century from now, when writing modern history, great people will find that this idea is not much different from the tricks used by the decaying Roman and Byzantine empires of ancient times. Those two empires were often threatened and extorted by various barbarian tribes. If the power of a certain barbarian tribe had reached a formidable point, and their armies had advanced to the gates of Rome or Constantinople, the ancient emperors would take out huge sums of money from the cellars and offer them to the enemy, asking them to take the wealth they had seized in the provinces and the imperial capital back to their lairs. The money offered was often less than the cost of engaging in a bitter struggle, but those barbarians were insatiable, coming and going, coming and going, countless times, until the empire's treasury was empty and nothing more could be offered, and then it was destroyed.</p>
<p>Today, bribing the Japanese naturally has the appearance of a business deal. It may be a line of credit, or a loan, or only paying interest without repaying the principal for a while, or adding interest, or discounts, or issuing public bonds, or using various financial tricks. The financiers will naturally receive commissions, and the tender sheep will inevitably suffer pain. The Japanese, for their part, will formally declare their obligation to repay, and abide by all the agreed-upon conditions. In addition to the financial agreement, there may also be a public or secret clause in which the Japanese will declare that they are satisfied with the amount of spoils they have obtained from the Chinese war and the bribes paid by the British, and that they will be content from now on. The conclusion of such an agreement is not impossible, but there is a big question: what value can be placed on the Japanese signature on this or any other treaty?</p>
<p>Financially speaking, the Japanese appear to be very respectable. They point to the fact that all maturing foreign debts have been paid on time. These Japanese foreign debts, handled by American agents or banks, indeed enjoy a very high and normal rating and have never been defaulted on. However, if Britain does not recite the "open the vault incantation," it is a big question whether Japan can continue to carefully maintain the credit of these foreign debts. Japan's foreign exchange position is now extremely tight. The gold and foreign exchange reserves are now very low. If the Japanese must continue to repay maturing foreign debts throughout the current war, their aim is clearly to obtain other foreign debts and lines of credit sooner or later. If they cannot fulfill their wishes, their borrowing policy will likely change. Recently, Tokyo newspapers have hinted that Japan may stop repaying foreign debts in retaliation against the Anglo-Saxon powers that had once promised to provide loans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Japan's financial policy is two-faced, which is often overlooked. On the mainland of the Far East, this policy has a terrible reputation. In the areas of China occupied by the Japanese, they have no respect for private property, rights, or obligations, and have repeatedly and arbitrarily occupied, confiscated, and engaged in financial fraud. Gambling is shocking. In order to know what kind of resistance we will offer, we must pay attention to the fate of the various fake Japanese and Chinese currencies circulating in China, pay attention to how the Japanese handle their own and Korean currencies in China, and pay attention to the Japanese confiscation of Chinese customs and railway revenues, making it impossible for China's foreign debts to be repaid on time. There have been dozens of financial guarantees made by the Japanese in China during the two years of the war that have not been fulfilled, and this should also be noted.</p>
<p>Even if this example of the Japanese not respecting financial autonomy is ignored, I still cannot understand why the value of Japanese financial guarantees is considered higher than political guarantees simply because the Japanese continue to repay foreign debts. Look at how the Japanese respect the signatures they signed in the Nine-Power Treaty, and how the invaders respect the principle of open doors to China and the interests of the Western powers in China. With this experience, we should ask what guarantees we can get that the Japanese will fulfill any guarantee in the future?</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the Japanese have repeatedly disregarded all the obligations and responsibilities they have undertaken to China and other established interests. This has been their consistent policy in China in order to resist and satisfy themselves. As a result, Chinese and other nationals have been completely plunged into calamity. The Japanese will never be truly satisfied by any concessions. Each concession made due to the mistaken belief that this is the last time is exploited by the Japanese to their great advantage. Shortly after each concession is granted, they create a new dispute and demand further concessions to resolve this dispute. Therefore, the Japanese have a well-deserved reputation in the Far East for having bottomless desires, being unscrupulous, and being absolutely unreliable, and yet there are still people in London who are unaware of this reputation of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Britain's past policy towards Japan has been riddled with mistakes. If they do not wake up and repeat the same mistakes, then attempting to bribe the Japanese today can be considered the height of error. The Japanese are in dire need of funds, and they will naturally be happy to accept them when someone is willing to provide them. After they receive them, they will use them to consolidate their current weak financial position. Once their position is consolidated, they will cause trouble for Britain and others. When things become critical, they will make new demands and do their best to play their excellent blackmailing tricks, destroying everything once again. Not only will all the money given to them be lost, not only will the guarantees given by Tokyo in preparation for quickly obtaining the funds be completely erased, but they will also use these funds to prepare for an even more vicious attack on the provider of these funds.</p>

<h3>Exchange Remittance System</h3>
<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>This July, the Shanghai Banking and Money Exchange Association, to enrich the operating reserves of the industry and regulate industrial and commercial capital, resolved that the Banking Joint Reserve would receive assets provided by various banks and firms to supply exchange remittance. Since its implementation, many enlightened people from all walks of life have written articles discussing it, offering guidance and praise, for which we are deeply grateful. Now, I will focus on the past and present of the exchange remittance system, attempting a systematic description for research and soliciting your advice.</p>
<p>What is Exchange Remittance?</p>
<p>Exchange remittance refers to negotiable instrument funds that can be cashed on the same day, differing from ordinary negotiable instruments only in that it is settled the next day. After August 13th, the inability to cash them immediately gave them the nature of "wartime blocked currency." However, exchange remittance has a long history, and its usage habits often change and have exceptions. The above can only be regarded as one explanation, not a definitive definition.</p>
<p>Exchange Remittance Before 1937</p>
<p>(1) The Formation of the Exchange Remittance System The exchange remittance system was formed due to the Shanghai money exchange industry. As early as sixty or seventy years ago, Shanghai's commerce was gradually prospering, and the use of negotiable instruments was essential for merchants. Money exchange draft slips and checks with the nature of checks, and exchange notes with the nature of promissory notes, became the main means of payment and collection in commerce. Due to the excellent credit and sufficient strength of the money exchanges, exchange notes were especially welcomed by Chinese and foreign merchants. The amount represented by these negotiable instruments was exchange remittance silver or exchange remittance dollars, also known as interbank silver or interbank dollars. At that time, money exchanges already had an exchange remittance general association. Money exchanges joining the general association were called "exchange remittance exchanges." The collection and payment of negotiable instruments between them, for amounts exceeding five hundred taels or five hundred dollars per item, were settled daily at the general association using public drafts. If the bearer requested cash, it would be paid the next day. Examining this habit of next-day cashing, the general opinion is that it arose to resist the encroachment of foreign banks, with the aim of allowing money exchanges to prepare for funds on the Bund one day in advance, avoiding temporary tightness. In fact, the exchange remittance system of money exchanges was originally based on credit. Payments for their negotiable instruments were usually made by transfer, so cash reserves could be reduced. If cash payment was required, it was necessary to raise funds in advance.</p>
<p>(2) The Generation and Circulation of Exchange Remittance The generation of money exchange remittance, that is, the issuance of exchange remittance negotiable instruments, was due to two reasons: one was lending, which was the creation of credit, and the other was the payment of deposits. Theoretically, the creation of credit is based on deposits, and the increase of deposits is partly due to lending. The two are mutually cause and effect, so it can be said that the generation of money exchange remittance is mostly due to the supply of credit.</p>
<p>The final holder of exchange remittance negotiable instruments either deposits the amount into a money exchange, which is a transfer of deposits, or cashes it at a Bund bank the next day, or pays an intermediary to exchange it for cash or silver dollars on the same day. In fact, except for next-day cashing at Bund banks, the final destination is often the money exchange, and other cash payments are probably not many.</p>
<p>Since the suppliers of exchange remittance were money exchanges, the increase or decrease in the amount of circulation in the market depended on the tightness or looseness of money exchange lending. The balance of exchange remittance circulation was regulated by the interbank agreed interest rate and the intermediary spread.</p>
<p>(3) The Scope of Exchange Remittance Includes Chinese Banks The payment currency of money exchanges was exchange remittance. The payment currency of Bund Chinese and foreign banks was immediate payment, which is negotiable instrument funds cashed on the same day, and the counterpart of exchange remittance. After the founding of the Republic of China, the number of Chinese banks increased, and most of them, except for those on the Bund, used both immediate payment and exchange remittance, and some used only exchange remittance. Chinese banks used exchange remittance by depositing a portion of their operating payment reserves in money exchanges, thereby utilizing the money exchanges' clearing system. All receivables and payables to other banks were handled through the deposit account. At the same time, this operating payment reserve could also generate interest through deposit. The scope of the exchange remittance system thus included Chinese banks.</p>
<p>In the above situation, one point should be noted, that is, the state of exchange remittance deposits and liabilities between the banking industry and the money exchange industry. For banks, it was always a deposit, and for money exchanges, it was always a liability. Between money exchanges, there were both deposits and liabilities. The former is commonly called "long position," and the latter is commonly called "short position."</p>
<p>(4) The Concentration of Exchange Remittance Deposits of the Banking and Money Exchange Industries After the Establishment of the Bank Clearing House In January 1933, the Bank Clearing House was officially opened. Each bank deposited a considerable amount of payment reserves with the reserve association for the needs of negotiable instrument exchange differences. The reserve association received these deposits and deposited them in the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications (in 1936, the Central Bank joined the clearing house, and the reserve association received various deposits, which were then deposited in the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank). Because immediate payment negotiable instruments and exchange remittance negotiable instruments had to be exchanged separately, and the differences had to be transferred separately, the funds deposited by each bank in the reserve association also had distinctions between immediate payment and exchange remittance. These exchange remittance deposits mostly came from the funds originally deposited in money exchanges. Thus, a portion of the funds originally deposited by each bank in money exchanges was concentrated in the reserve association, and another portion remained in the money exchanges for the needs of each bank's collection and payment of negotiable instruments to the money exchanges. In June 1935, a financial crisis occurred in the money exchange industry. According to the resolution of the industry association, each bank transferred all funds deposited in various money exchanges to the money exchange reserve treasury. The banks entrusted the Bank Clearing House to collect all negotiable instruments from the money exchanges. Thus, the other portion of funds deposited in money exchanges was also completely concentrated in the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank. Since then, the state of deposits and liabilities between banks and money exchanges has changed. That is, the funds originally deposited in various money exchanges are now concentrated in the reserve association, and the reserve association transfers them to the three banks, and the three banks transfer them to the money exchange reserve treasury. For each money exchange, a portion of the funds in the reserve treasury is a long position, and the rest are short positions.</p>
<p>Exchange Remittance System After August 13th (1) Exchange Remittance Cannot Be Cashed After the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13th, the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures to stabilize the financial market, imposing restrictions on the withdrawal of deposits by depositors in the banking and money exchange industries. Although the banking and money exchange industries themselves were thus relieved of the worry of large withdrawals, the most important problem at that time was that the circulating currency in the Shanghai market would be insufficient due to the restrictions on withdrawals, and it was urgent to find ways to raise funds to prevent industry and commerce from stagnating. The Banking Association held an emergency meeting and resolved to formulate supplementary measures to stabilize the financial market, which were submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation. Commercial deposits could withdraw exchange remittance beyond the original limit, but exchange remittance was limited to interbank and inter-money exchange transfers and could not be cashed. The money exchange industry also took similar measures.</p>
<p>The government's wartime monetary policy not only avoided inflation throughout, but initially tended towards contraction. Shanghai was the financial hub of the country and at that time was the rear for secret communication with the front. The banking and money exchange industries, understanding the government's painstaking efforts, strived to stabilize the market and therefore appropriately utilized the existing exchange remittance system. Paying exchange remittance outside the limit was an active supply of necessary funds for industry and commerce. The inability to cash exchange remittance was a wartime blockade of the above funds. It was an extraordinary measure in an extraordinary period. At that time, the banking and money exchange industries were ordered to close for three days and fully resumed business on August 17th, with a neat posture and calm response. During the three months of the Shanghai War, the market was rarely disturbed. This method was applied throughout the country, but in other cities without an exchange remittance system, industry and commerce felt a lack of funds. During the January 28th Incident, money exchanges also had restrictions on the inability to cash exchange remittance negotiable instruments, but it was implemented very briefly.</p>
<p>(2) Exchange Remittance Discounted for Cash After the implementation of the wartime exchange remittance system, it was quite convenient for domestic industry and commerce that had always been accustomed to using exchange remittance. However, because exchange remittance could not be used to purchase foreign exchange, and its transfer scope was limited to the domestic financial industry, foreign banks gradually discriminated against it and refused to accept it. Importers gradually reduced the exchange remittance obtained from sales by one or two percent to exchange for legal tender for their needs. Later, the amount of exchange remittance in the market increased, and cash became insufficient. Therefore, those who collected legal tender to profit by buying and selling exchange remittance took the opportunity to rise. From July 1938, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank entrusted the reserve association to moderately regulate the legal tender needs of the industry, and the market for discounting for cash became stable. However, once exchange remittance could be exchanged for cash, many people took advantage of it over time, and the blockade of funds thus leaked. The supply of the banking and money exchange industries to customers was originally limited to the real needs of importers, but it was impossible to impose strict ex ante restrictions in practice. By May 1939, the three banks had discussed with the reserve association to stop the supply of legal tender, but they did not proceed because they were aware of the market's susceptibility to stimulation.</p>
<p>(3) The Government's Restriction on Withdrawals Again Starting in 1938, the market situation developed abnormally, and it became more apparent in the spring and summer of 1939. The important points are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Refugees from various places densely populated Shanghai; bank and money exchange deposits increased rather than decreased; floating capital abounded.</p>
<p>(2) The population increased sharply, urban life was wasteful, and the trade deficit was even greater.</p>
<p>(3) The practice of purchasing foreign exchange in the black market remained the same; after the foreign exchange rate fell to a new level of six and five-eighths pence on June 7th, there were even more buyers.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese collected legal tender from the occupied areas to obtain foreign exchange, which became even more intense.</p>
<p>(5) The trend of commodity speculation gradually grew.</p>
<p>On June 21st, Shanghai banks and money exchanges received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance (June 21st) restricting the withdrawal of legal tender deposits made after August 13th. At that time, the payment ability of the banking and money exchange industries was sufficient, and the original intention of this restriction was purely to restrain foreign exchange speculation and capital flight. Judging from the withdrawal limit, it was more than three times wider than the measures to stabilize the financial market, which can be clearly understood. After implementation, large-scale speculation had been slightly contained. However, the environment in Shanghai has been much worse recently; unfounded and malicious rumors took the opportunity to arise. Many ordinary depositors, who originally had no intention of withdrawing deposits, misunderstood because of the rumors and rushed to withdraw deposits within the limit as much as possible and hoard them. Although the banking and money exchange industries were able to cope with ease, they had to strengthen their strength and jointly plan for the aftermath, which led to the emergence of the "New Exchange Remittance System."</p>
<p>The New Exchange Remittance System</p>
<p>(1) What is the New Exchange Remittance System Before describing the new exchange remittance system, we should know that the term "new exchange remittance system" is not very accurate. Because it has been adopted in newspapers and within the industry, and there is no other suitable term at present, we will temporarily borrow it. The implementation of the new exchange remittance system does not change the nature of exchange remittance after August 13th. Its main feature, in short, is the "strengthening of the exchange remittance payment reserve of the banking and money exchange industries."</p>
<p>At the end of June, a joint meeting of the banking and money exchange industries discussed the response and aftermath of the market situation after restricting withdrawals, and decided to appropriately adjust the interbank and inter-money exchange remittance payment reserve. The adjustment methods were:</p>
<p>(1) The original exchange remittance positions of each bank and firm (that is, the deposits originally deposited by each bank and firm in the reserve association and reserve treasury) were converted into legal tender at 95 percent of their value, and the reserve association would exchange them in twelve weeks.</p>
<p>(2) The reserve association would receive assets provided by each bank and firm to supply exchange remittance, with the total amount of issuance tentatively set at 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) "Strengthening" the Exchange Remittance Payment Reserve of the Banking and Money Exchange Industries In addition to exchanging the original exchange remittance deposits of each bank and firm into legal tender in installments, the reserve association assumed the responsibility of supplying exchange remittance payment reserves to the industry from July 4th. First, interbank and inter-money exchange remittance was prepared with assets. Each bank and firm had to deposit the assets specified in the borrowing method with the reserve association as collateral when borrowing exchange remittance. The amount of borrowed exchange remittance could not exceed 70 percent of the assessed value of the assets. Second, the inspection, evaluation, and custody of the above assets were undertaken by representatives of Chinese and Western banks and money exchanges and experts from various Chinese and Western industries in the city. The collection and settlement of negotiable instruments between banks and money exchanges was also completely concentrated in the reserve association from July 4th.</p>
<p>The reserve association has established interbank and inter-money exchange remittance borrowing methods and exchange remittance reserve inspection rules, which have been reported in the newspapers and will not be described in detail here. We will try to compare the past and present of the exchange remittance payment reserve of the banking and money exchange industries. (A) The previous exchange remittance payment reserve was the indirect lending of each bank and each money exchange to money exchanges with short positions, and its final guarantee was the assets and shareholder liability of each money exchange with short positions. The relationship between exchange remittance claims and debts (each bank deposits with the reserve association, the reserve association deposits with the three banks, the three banks deposit with the money exchange treasury, and the money exchange treasury deposits with each money exchange with short positions, as mentioned above) has been eliminated in the banks and money exchanges with long positions due to the exchange of legal tender, and the three banks are currently handling it separately for the relationship between the reserve treasury and the money exchanges with short positions. (B) The current exchange remittance payment reserve is prepared with assets of 100 percent or more, and is responsible for inspection, evaluation, and custody by leaders from all walks of life in China and the West.</p>
<p>(3) The Circulation of Exchange Remittance After the Implementation of the New System Because the supply of exchange remittance from banks to industry and commerce is mostly the payment of checks drawn on the reserve association, strengthening the exchange remittance reserve is tantamount to directly guaranteeing the circulation of exchange remittance. Foreign banks that refused to accept exchange remittance after August 13th have accepted it as a result. However, discounting exchange remittance outside the banking and money exchange industries is still difficult to eliminate. In today's precarious environment, speculators can still take advantage of the situation and forcibly control it. Now, the reserve association's adjustment of exchange remittance discounting should stop the implementation at the beginning of restricting withdrawals, so that even if the underground market for discounting continues to have soaring and plummeting situations, its scope of activity is small, and the abnormal leakage of blocked funds can be completely prevented from now on. In addition, it is regrettable that recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the market feels more uneasy, and some industries in the city have used exchange remittance.</p>
<p>(4) The Exchange Remittance Certificate is Prepared But Not Used At the beginning of the implementation of the new exchange remittance system, the banking and money exchange industries, in view of the time-sensitive nature of exchange remittance negotiable instruments, and for the convenience of daily acceptance, had planned to issue exchange remittance certificates by the reserve association. The reserve association could pay the final holder of the negotiable instrument with exchange remittance certificates. However, (1) the strengthening of the interbank and inter-money exchange remittance reserve predicted that exchange remittance certificates would be very popular. If the general public trusted exchange remittance certificates as much as they trusted legal tender and hoarded exchange remittance certificates, the assets deposited by each bank and firm with the reserve association would have the possibility of being "stuck," which would be contrary to the purpose of the reserve association to supply currency and facilitate industry and commerce. (2) At the beginning of the discussion on exchange remittance certificates, there were rumors in the market about circulating currency. Although the truth was clarified and the rumors stopped, prudence was advisable in today's uneasy environment. Therefore, the exchange remittance certificate is prepared but not used, and there will probably be no need to issue it in the future.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The history of the exchange remittance system, the meaning of wartime blockade, and the situation of strengthening the payment reserve have been briefly described above. What we should understand is: (1) Exchange remittance was originally negotiable instrument funds cashed the next day, and immediate payment was originally the same currency. Their value cannot be different. The inability to cash it is an extraordinary measure during the war, with positive characteristics. It is predicted that after the end of the war, this blockade will be lifted. In the future, the exchange remittance system may be completely abolished, or at least the old system of cashing the next day will be restored before the abolition. (2) The large difference between exchange remittance and legal tender at present is purely due to speculation and profiteering outside the financial industry. Domestic industry and commerce that have always been accustomed to using exchange remittance must not change their habits, so that the banking and money exchange industries can continue to supply funds outside the legal tender deposit limit and continue to assist them. (3) The government's monetary policy strives for soundness. The purpose of the past measures has been to strengthen financial institutions and protect the national vitality. The public in this city must not listen to rumors and suffer losses themselves.</p>
<h3>Today's Currency Market in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Chen Rentao</p>
<p>The Black Market for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>From the Japanese invasion of Shanghai on August 13th to the present, it has been exactly two years. Shanghai has been occupied for a year and a half. During this period, the environment has been special, and the experiences have been incomparable to other occupied areas. The most alarming phenomena are the collapse of the black market for foreign exchange, the rise in prices, and the sharp increase in population. The collapse of the black market for foreign exchange is the most serious.</p>
<p>Four Stages</p>
<p>Although the black market for foreign exchange has undergone countless changes, it can be analyzed into four stages over the past two years:</p>
<p>The first stage was from the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13th to February of the following year. The market price of foreign exchange in Shanghai remained stable at one shilling and two pence for the British pound and around 29 yuan for the US dollar. This exchange rate was very close to the official rate set on November 4, 1935, when the currency system was reformed. The exchange rate remained constant when the War of Resistance broke out, which proves the effectiveness of government support and the enthusiasm of public support. At that time, maritime transport was suspended, imports were halted, the government implemented measures to stabilize the financial market, restricting deposits and withdrawals, and the amount of legal tender circulating in the market was reduced, which was also a powerful factor in stabilizing the exchange rate at that time.</p>
<p>The second stage was from the spring of 1938, when the government formulated two measures, the Application for Foreign Exchange for Imports and the Sale and Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Exports, and the black market for foreign exchange arose, to February of this year. Due to the Japanese control of materials, trade fluctuated. Government banks gradually tightened the approval of applications for foreign exchange, and industrialists, businessmen, and speculators turned to the black market. At the same time, the British, in order to maintain the status quo of customs administration, expressed compromise to the Japanese, giving the Japanese a great opportunity to collect legal tender. Later, there was the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou in October. The stable situation of foreign exchange in Shanghai also began to shake, with the British pound falling to eight pence and the US dollar approaching 16 yuan.</p>
<p>The third stage began in mid-March of this year, when the Sino-British Joint Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was established, and the Shanghai currency market entered the third stage. The combined strength of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, HSBC, and Chartered Bank formed 10 million British pounds. This organization was created by the Sino-British relationship and also because of the historical relationship of the legal tender, bringing together two parties with common interests to provide clear support.</p>
<p>The fourth stage When the second stage was in progress, the entire city of Shanghai was immersed in abnormal prosperity. By the third stage, the abnormal prosperity reached its peak. A large number of people gathered, and floating capital followed. What was reflected was: the consumption of imported goods increased without end; speculation became frenzied; on the one hand, there were citizens buying foreign exchange and fleeing with capital; on the other hand, there were Japanese and puppet organizations trying to obtain foreign exchange as much as possible. Under this internal and external attack, the stabilization fund took measures such as suspending the supply on June 7th and restricting withdrawals for the second time on June 22nd, in order to adjust the exchange market, stabilize the financial market, and prevent the escape of capital and arbitrage. Those who did not understand the truth were bewildered and could not distinguish, and rumors were rampant. The black market for foreign exchange collapsed. The British pound broke four pence, and the US dollar was only a little over six yuan. The author believes that this is the beginning of the fourth stage of the Shanghai currency market.</p>
<p>Two Viewpoints</p>
<p>Since the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai collapsed, the most intense reflections have been the soaring prices and the panic of the people. There are many guesses and discussions. Among them, there are two different viewpoints, which are outlined as follows:</p>
<p>Advocating Letting It Take Its Course, believing that the black market exchange rate in Shanghai is a local and partial problem. Even if it falls extremely, it is not enough to shake the credit and inherent value of the legal tender and cause it to fall. If we leave Shanghai aside, the prices in non-occupied areas are relatively stable, not as soaring as the Shanghai market (those who rise due to supply and demand or transportation reasons should be discussed separately). This proves that the rise and fall of the exchange rate in one corner of Shanghai cannot represent the actual value of the legal tender? I have heard that someone has slandered that the legal tender will be the continuation of the mark, which is the nonsense of madmen and does not need to be refuted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the standpoint of the entire country, the results of foreign exchange decline formed by capital flight or Japanese and puppet arbitrage are all legitimate consumption, and there is a need to prevent them. Moreover, the imported goods are mostly luxury goods. At this time of national crisis, it is necessary to prevent enjoyment. In the case of Shanghai where it is impossible to control, the loophole is open, which is tantamount to financing the enemy.</p>
<p>Let us examine the sources of the government's previous support for the foreign exchange fund. In addition to the collection of existing silver deposits and issuance reserves in the country, it may be remittances from overseas Chinese or assistance from friendly countries, as well as foreign exchange obtained from the export of agricultural and mineral products. That is, the government's hard work and the hard work of most farmers and workers should be used to exchange for urgently needed goods during the war, but now they are used here? It is heartbreaking to say! Therefore, a humorist has the ridicule of "giving up airplanes and cannons to take pollen perfume for the luxury use of one corner of Shanghai." Therefore, in nature, they also advocate letting it take its course.</p>
<p>Advocating Continuing to Maintain It, saying: The government has repeatedly stated that it will stabilize the exchange rate, and the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have also publicly stated their determination to support it, because currency is to the people as air is to living beings, and it cannot be separated for a moment. Once the legal tender fluctuates in Shanghai, there will be many people who take advantage of the opportunity, and the Hwa Hsing pseudo-currency is watching on the side. The suggestions of foreign businessmen are also noisy. Regardless of whether it is possible to implement it, this is enough to shake the foundation of the legal tender in Shanghai and give the trade interests of Europe and the United States in China a major blow. The British have a history of more than 80 years in China and have enormous interests. How can they allow others to strip them clean? With the ingenuity of Europeans and Americans, they must plan for it. Based on this, although the current situation is extremely difficult, Europeans and Americans must support the Shanghai exchange market for their own interests, and the government should take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, the two viewpoints are absolutely contradictory because of their different arguments. Therefore, a part of the currency is fleeing in different directions under this severe air pressure. If we analyze where it is going, there are three ways:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign Exchange Speculation Industrialists, businessmen, speculators, general rich people, and Japanese and puppet organizations are all absorbing it vigorously, resulting in today's lowest record of foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>(2) Transferring Capital to Inland Areas Inland banks offer preferential exchange rates to attract capital. The government advocates and the public supports it. A large number of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, with considerable capital, go to the southwest to relocate and start businesses. Because the legal tender in the inland areas still has a normal value, and all enterprises can profit, they can avoid the threat of currency on foreign exchange prices and enjoy the government's protection in the inland areas.</p>
<p>(3) Commodity Speculation Another part of the capital knows that it should not escape abroad, and transferring capital to the inland areas is subject to certain restrictions, so some people hoard goods and wait for changes. In the past ten days, major goods have been purchased at high prices and prices have soared, which can be used as an example.</p>
<p>The author believes that from the point of view of interests, the current exchange rate of Shanghai currency is more important to the future of British and American trade than to the Chinese government. It also believes that the Shanghai currency market needs support, and the stability of the citizens and the cooperation of the upper and lower levels are the most important. As for the United Kingdom and the United States, they should have a long-term vision, sincerely support and provide practical assistance. This is the right time. As for the measures and techniques, the new level of the exchange rate should be based on the three goals of (1) coping with the currency war in the Far East (2) preventing large-scale arbitrage and escape (3) eliminating the import of luxury goods. Its decision is to pay attention to the method of support. It is hoped that the currency authorities will express a clear attitude and support this new level with solid and effective measures, so that the Shanghai market can return to tranquility after the turbulent waves.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued-3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Feng Meiqi Shishi</p>
<p>Therefore, the result is that Japan's exchange difficulties remain unresolved. The commodity import deficit in 1939 still needs to be offset by gold shipments, as in 1937-1938. In the first four months of 1939, Japan shipped gold to the United States worth a total of $60,202,815, or 220 million yen. Based on this estimate, Japan's gold reserves will be exhausted by the end of this year. Although this estimate does not include the gold previously deposited in the United States. Even including that, the amount remaining in 1940 would be minimal. Japan used 1.5 billion yen of its gold reserves in the two years prior to April 1939. During the same period, its reserves of raw materials for export industries, such as raw cotton and wool, also decreased significantly. Since August 1937, no figures have been released for the production and reserves of military materials such as pig iron, steel, crude oil, and copper, but it is known that their reserves have decreased significantly. Japan's balance of payments is currently extremely difficult to manage, and if it becomes involved in a major war, it will undoubtedly become even more acute.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned economic problems of Japan are based on the situation since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the past two years. If it becomes involved in the vortex of a major war, the situation will be different. Now, let us observe the main areas of Japan's foreign trade to estimate the possible impact that a major war will have.</p>
<p>The four major areas of Japan's foreign trade are: the Yen Bloc, the Anti-Comintern Allies, the British-French-Dutch Alliance, and the United States. For some time after the outbreak of a major war, the Yen Bloc can still serve as a support for the Japanese economy. The possible threats are the Chinese resistance or disturbances in Manchuria in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union. As a result, the Western powers and the United States will inevitably be unable to attend to the Far East in the short term. In 1938, the Yen Bloc (including China) supplied Japan with goods worth 1.489 million yen, while Japan's total imports were 3.588 million yen; the value of goods purchased from Japan was 2.243 million yen, while Japan's total exports were 3.7768 million yen. Therefore, last year, the goods supplied by the Yen Bloc accounted for three-sevenths of Japan's imports, and absorbed slightly less than two-thirds of its exports. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Money Dealers Buy In; Gold Price Returns to High of 70 Yuan; Jewelry Gold Also Rises by 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash futures market was sluggish. Due to the Sunday holiday, there were no formal market quotations. However, it was rumored that a money exchange dealer initially bought dozens of taels from jewelry stores at a price of 4,380 yuan. Later, a money exchange dealer continued to buy in. At noon, it was rumored that the price had risen to 4,390 yuan, an increase of about 70 yuan compared to the closing price yesterday afternoon. For jewelry gold, major stores initially quoted 445 yuan per tael, while newer stores quoted 443 yuan. There were no changes after that, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The buying price was about 20 yuan lower than the selling price. On the 12th, a London dispatch reported that pure British gold remained at £7, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Cover Short Positions; Market Firm; No News from the US and India Due to Holiday</h3>
<p>A London dispatch on the 12th reported that the silver market saw short covering and speculative buying. Supply was limited, and the market was firm. Large bars of silver rose by 0.0625 for the near term and 0.125 for the long term. Silver prices in New York and Bombay were unavailable due to the holiday.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: New Melon Seeds Rise by 3-4 Yuan; Shuidong Branches Rise by 6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shuidong Branches: Two batches totaling over 80 boxes have arrived. It is understood that the stores in the North City have already opened, with higher prices at around 67 yuan. The final price was slightly lower, but still 5-6 yuan higher than before, the highest price seen in recent years. It is rumored that the source of supply may be difficult to increase, so the market situation is very firm.</p>
<p>Xukui Seeds: New seeds have appeared in the producing areas, and the asking price has repeatedly risen by 3-4 yuan. The demand from large dealers is even less, so the price has also increased accordingly. Only a few packages have arrived in Shanghai, barely meeting the needs for new trials. It will not be easy to relax the situation in the short term.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Indian Bleached Fine Cloth Stable - Only Coarse Cloth Falls Slightly -</h3>
<p>A Bombay dispatch on the 12th reported that the Indian cloth market was stable. Bleached fine cloth was selling for 12 rupees and 1 anna per piece, with no change from last week's price. Thirty-yard Longtou coarse cloth was selling for 3 rupees and 5 annas, a decrease of 1 anna.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Indian Cotton Weekend Statistics</h3>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, Indian cotton statistics from September 1, 1938, to August 12, 1939, are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales, each bale weighing 400 pounds; Yangon cotton is calculated in tons): Bombay Karachi Yangon</p>
<h3>20-Count Single Yarn: High Profit</h3>
<p>Since 20-count special Golden City yarn reached a peak of over 700 yuan (per piece), 20-count Double Horse yarn has also been rising steadily. Yesterday (August 8th), the spot price was 655 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 628 yuan (a difference of 27 yuan per piece between the spot and warehouse receipt prices). If we calculate its cost, then the raw material for 20-count single yarn, taking foreign cotton White Rock as the standard, requires a price of about 1 yuan per pound. Then, 133.33 pounds per dan requires a price of 133.33 yuan per dan. Even if we add some for the drastic changes in foreign exchange, let's say 135 yuan. Using 350 catties of cotton per piece of yarn, then the cost of the cotton is 472.5 yuan in national currency. Adding 85 to 90 yuan for each piece for fees, the total cost is about 550-560 yuan. According to the spot price on the 8th, there is still a huge profit of 100 yuan. Therefore, no matter how foreign exchange is pressured, the yarn factory's war profiteering is still considerable.

<h3>Yao Yi of Zhejiang Cotton Is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch) Since the interruption of the shipping route for Zhejiang cotton, it has been a long time since Hehe cotton has been able to arrive in Shanghai. The 10-count coarse yarn from the Hefeng Yarn Factory and the cotton yarn of the Red Lotus Bee and White Lotus Bee brands have all been affected, and traffic with Shanghai has been blocked, preventing sales in Shanghai. Recently, shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been smooth, but cargo ships cannot enter the blockade line, so goods must be transferred by small boats to large ships. It is said that Zhejiang cotton Yao Yi and 10-count coarse yarn may soon be shipped here. It is also heard that the old cotton stocks there are not thick, and a portion has been shipped to the rear for adjustment, but the selling price is quite low. If it is shipped out, the abundance of profits is beyond description. It is also heard that the condition of the new cotton in Zhejiang Province is still good. If the weather is favorable in the future, a bumper harvest can be expected. (Huan)</p>
<h3>Statistics: Price Increases in July - 152 Cases -</h3>
<p>Since the sharp changes in the black market foreign exchange rate in Shanghai on June 7th, with the British exchange rate settling at 6 and 9/16 pence from 8 and 1/4 pence, and the US exchange rate settling at 12 and 25/32 yuan from 16 and 3/32 yuan after two days of fluctuation, it triggered a roaring wave of price increases, rising in a straight line, posing a serious threat to the livelihoods of people living in Shanghai. Before people could catch their breath, on July 17th, the black market foreign exchange rate saw another surprising contraction, with the British exchange rate shrinking to a low of 3.75 pence and the US exchange rate shrinking to 6 yuan. Subsequently, the British exchange rate fluctuated around 4 pence, and the US exchange rate fluctuated around 7 yuan. This contraction led to another sharp rise in prices, causing Shanghai residents to groan as if they were having convulsions. There is no need for prices to rise so sharply, and those in the know are naturally very clear about this, and there is precise monitoring from the outside world. It is definitely not something that can be concealed from the eyes and ears of the people of the whole city.</p>
<p>Now, let's count the price increases listed in newspaper announcements, totaling 152 cases, that is, 152 price-increasing industrial, commercial, factory, and group units. After deducting one case of price increases, the net count is 151 cases. These 151 cases of price increases include 99 types of goods. The extent of the price increases reached as high as double, and the lowest was more than 10%. Comparatively speaking, the most common price increases were 20-30%. Here, let's analyze the 152 price increases by commodity category. They can be divided into 16 categories, namely, food and beverages, clothing, medicine, decoration, daily necessities, packaging, metal and electrical appliances, transportation, cultural supplies, publishing and printing, fuel, cleaning, advertising, raw materials, paint, construction, and auctions. Among them, food and beverages, with 20 types, ranks first; clothing, metal and electrical appliances, cultural supplies, and publishing and printing, each with 9 types, ranks second; decoration and daily necessities, each with 8 types, ranks third; medicine and transportation, each with 7 types, ranks fourth; packaging and paint, each with 5 types, ranks fifth; cleaning, with 3 types, ranks sixth; advertising, fuel, construction, and raw materials, each with 2 types, ranks seventh; and auctions, with 1 type, ranks last. The price-increased goods and the percentage of price increases are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Tea snacks and smoked fish, a minimum increase of 30 cents, 1.28 yuan per catty. Cakes, a minimum increase of 8 cents, 50 cents per piece. Preserved fruits, a minimum increase of 8 cents, 32 cents per catty. Melon seeds, a minimum increase of 5 cents, 64 cents per catty. Almond crisps, 5 cents each. Western egg cakes, 5 cents each. (Tea Snack Industry Association)</p>
<p>(2) Liquor: Brandy and wine increased by 10-20% of the original price. (Zhangyu Winery)</p>
<p>(3) Jian Shen Lu (health tonic): Each case increased by 4 yuan of the original price. (Jardine Matheson)</p>

<h3>Yesterday Marked the Second Anniversary of the Shanghai War: A Solemn and Peaceful Observance; City-Wide Ban on Banquets and Entertainment for One Day; Security Situation Expected to Ease Today; Commendable Efforts of Business Corps and Chinese Units</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Shanghai War. All sectors voluntarily suspended entertainment and banquets, displaying a firm and solemn attitude. The city, under heavy guard by the concession authorities, maintained good order. Vigilance will continue today and tomorrow, but the situation is expected to ease. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Citizens Maintained a Solemn Attitude</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the second anniversary of the Shanghai War. Various groups and citizens in the city did not engage in any formal celebrations but mostly voluntarily suspended entertainment and banquets. Some also voluntarily observed a vegetarian day to commemorate the fallen soldiers and compatriots and to demonstrate their firm belief in the resistance. The attitude was very solemn and steadfast.</p>
<p>National Flags Displayed Briefly on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Due to the special circumstances in the city, the Chinese side had previously agreed with the concession authorities regarding the display of flags on commemorative days, limiting it to eight days, including National Day. Therefore, no flags were displayed throughout the city yesterday. However, around 7:00 AM yesterday, some shops in the bustling area of Nanjing Road near the Polo Ground, motivated by patriotism, still voluntarily displayed flags. For a moment, the blue and white flags fluttered in the wind, commemorating this sacred anniversary of the resistance. However, the police authorities were soon informed and sent detectives to persuade them to take them down. The shops respected the police's advice and voluntarily removed the flags.</p>
<p>Citizens Stayed Home, Businesses Were Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Shanghai War and also Sunday. Banks, money exchanges, foreign firms, and major companies were closed as usual. Most citizens, to commemorate the resistance and because of the dense presence of detectives searching the streets, mostly stayed home to avoid trouble. As a result, the number of pedestrians on the streets decreased by 30-40% compared to normal days, and business in the shops was also sluggish, making the market seem deserted. North of the Suzhou Creek, most shops were not fully open, and street vendors were nowhere to be seen, making the streets even more sparsely populated. The market situation was very bleak. Additionally, shops on the Avenue Edward VII side bordering the French Concession had all closed on the 7/7 anniversary, but yesterday, most remained open except for a few that closed.</p>
<p>Business Corps and Chinese Units Took Special Precautions</p>
<p>The two concessions decided to implement preventive measures, joint patrols, and all the armed forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were mobilized to assist the police in guarding key locations with the utmost strictness and thoroughness. Among the various corps of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the Chinese units bore the heaviest burden of defense, and their work was extremely intense. Since receiving confidential orders from the corps headquarters, the unit had mobilized a portion of its personnel as early as the 8th to take turns guarding the Municipal Council. From the 9th, they were all fully armed and awaiting orders. On the evening of the 11th and the morning of the 12th, all officers and men of the two Chinese Translator units were mobilized and gathered at the Municipal Council barracks and the Central Bank on the Bund to await orders. From 5:00 AM on the 12th, they were responsible for protecting the major Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city, dispatching a large number of personnel to guard the entrances and vicinity of the China Press, the Shanghai Evening Post, the Ta Kung Pao, the Shun Pao, the Sin Wan Pao, the China Times, the North-China Daily News, the International Daily News, the Sin Wen Pao, the News Tribune, and other newspaper offices on Avenue Edward VII, Nanking Road, and Hankow Road. Machine guns were set up on the sandbag fortifications temporarily built at each newspaper location, and they were strictly guarded day and night in shifts. It was not until noon on the 13th that the Scottish and Jewish units of A Company and AB Company relieved the above-mentioned newspaper positions. After a brief rest, the Chinese units were ordered to switch to patrol duties at 12:00 PM, organizing more than a dozen groups of vehicle and foot patrols to patrol key areas such as Foochow Road, Szechuan Road, Kiangsi Road, Canton Road, Fukien Road, Ningpo Road, Tientsin Road, Chekiang Road, Rue Chiao Hsiang, Avenue Edward VII, and the Bund. The situation over the past five days has been very good. All levels of personnel have enthusiastically carried out their duties, and their military appearance, discipline, and service spirit have been praised by the general public.</p>
<p>Recreation Venues Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, all recreation venues, such as theaters like the Golden, Carlton, Paramount, and Grand Theatre, cinemas like the Guanghua, Golden, Shanxi, Jiuxing, Xihai, and others, amusement parks like the New World, the Great World, Wing On, Sincere, and the Sun Sun, Yue Opera theaters like the Laozha, Da Zhonghua, and Yiyuan, story-telling theaters like the Zhongnan and Dongfang, swimming pools like the Continental Swimming Pool, drama theaters like the Xuan Gong, and various dance halls were all closed for one day. Only the Nanjing, Cathay, Grand, Hukwang, Lido, Paris, Kwong Loke, and Kinema cinemas showed films as usual. However, the audience was mostly foreigners, with few Chinese. From today, except for the Great World, which will remain closed for another day, all other recreation venues will reopen, but they will still close before 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>Japanese-Directed Puppet Farce</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Shanghai War. In the morning, the Japanese troops in Nanshi gathered over 200 ignorant primary school students, female laborers, and coolies to hold their so-called "celebration" parade. At around 10:00 AM, they began a week-long parade along Chung Hua Road, Min Kuo Road, and around the city. The procession was led by five-colored puppet flags, followed by Japanese flags. The primary school students carried slogans and small flags, with the women bringing up the rear. Ten tanks trailed at the end, along with 20-30 puppet policemen riding bicycles on both sides. Along the way, they forced the children to shout absurd slogans and distribute leaflets. At the same time, similar farces were found in Pudong, Zhabei, and Hongkou.</p>
<p>Heavy Guard, Peaceful Order</p>
<p>The two concession authorities, to prevent incidents on the "August 13th Anniversary," had begun their guard as early as the morning of the 9th. The past two days have been even more serious. All the armed forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have been fully mobilized, and armored vehicles have been continuously patrolling the streets. The total strength of the troops has reached about 20,000, which can be said to be unprecedented in Shanghai. The pile-up of sandbags and fortifications and the installation of machine guns at the entrances of various newspaper offices are even more unique. Yesterday, the inspection at the entrances and exits of various roads was even stricter. Under extremely strict guard, the city was unusually peaceful, and there were no incidents until dusk.</p>
<p>Prevention Efforts to Continue Today and Tomorrow, Expected to Ease</p>
<p>The joint guard began on the 9th and is scheduled to be lifted on the evening of the 15th. Therefore, prevention efforts will continue today and tomorrow. However, given the good order and peaceful situation yesterday, the security situation is expected to ease somewhat today. The number of troops and corps mobilized will be slightly reduced. If no unexpected events occur, it will be lifted after 12:00 AM tomorrow night, or perhaps earlier tonight at 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>Leaflets Distributed, Absurd Propaganda</p>
<p>At about 12:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese plane flew in the sky and dropped a large number of absurd leaflets as it flew over the Huisi and Hongkou areas north of the Suzhou Creek, blowing towards Zhabei. A small number of leaflets fell on North Chekiang Road, Haining Road, and Wenjianshi Road. After the citizens picked them up, they immediately tore them up. At the same time, many patriotic leaflets were found on telephone poles and walls in the Jing'an Temple Road, Hardoon Road, Avenue Road, and Xinzha Road areas.</p>
<p>French Park Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai. In addition to stepping up security work, the French Concession specifically closed the French Park on Rue Lubin to prevent undesirable elements from mixing into the park and causing trouble.</p>
<p>French Concession Continued Searches Yesterday</p>
<p>At about 5:00 PM yesterday, the French police dispatched a large number of detectives to search residences on Rue de Bel, Route Saipo Sai, Rue Bourboulon, and Avenue Foch, which lasted for more than an hour before ending. As a result, nothing was found. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, they returned to search the Da Hu Hotel at the Dongxin Bridge entrance on Avenue Edward VII. A Japanese man and a Chinese man with suspicious behavior were found in room 501. A long Japanese paper was seized from the Japanese man on the spot. Because no one recognized Japanese at the time, it was taken to the police station for study. It was not an important document and was released immediately.</p>
<h3>Tense Situation in Zhoupu Town Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Nanhui City and the burning of Datuan Town, Zhoupu, an important town in Pudong, has been on high alert, with scares happening several times a day. Chinese guerrillas are getting closer and closer. The Japanese troops stationed in Zhoupu are only seeking to protect their headquarters. In addition to setting up electric fences and steel cannons around the perimeter and adding troops and weapons, they have dispatched planes to conduct low-altitude reconnaissance over the various towns around Zhoupu for days. Yesterday morning, a squadron of aircraft patrolled repeatedly, their expressions extremely flustered. It is rumored that the Chinese side had originally planned to mobilize all its forces from the entire territory to converge and attack Zhoupu Town the day before yesterday, but due to inconvenient transportation, the actual situation has not been confirmed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Extradition of Four Chinese in Tianjin Pending Decision by British Judge; Shanghai British Lawyers Petition for Protection of Person; Righteous Action of British People Demonstrates That Justice Has Not Been Extinguished; Verdict in This Case Possible Today</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that Mr. Lykes, a well-known British lawyer from the law office of Ellis and Hayes in Shanghai, received a telegram from a London lawyer regarding the case of the four Chinese suspects detained by the British Concession authorities in Tianjin. Yesterday morning (August 12th), he submitted a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the British Supreme Court for China. It is known that the central government had issued an order on Friday night to hand over the four suspects to the North China regime under Japanese control. The British Embassy in Tokyo then officially announced this matter. It was heard from reliable sources in Shanghai last night that the four people</p>
<p>Have Not Yet Been Extradited</p>
<p>Considering that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus has now been filed, well-informed sources believe that the decision is pending by the British Supreme Court in Shanghai. The judge hearing the case is Jones. It is heard that Mr. Lykes received a telegram from London before dusk on Friday and</p>
<p>Prepared Everything Overnight So that he could apply to Judge Jones the next morning. The hearing began yesterday morning and continued until before dusk. Because the four people detained in Tianjin, although arrested within the British Concession, are Chinese and not subject to the jurisdiction of the British court, Judge Jones decided to give this matter careful consideration. Yesterday</p>
<p>The hearing was completed and he adjourned the verdict. However, because this case is urgent, it is believed that the judge will deliver a verdict on Monday or Tuesday. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus jointly filed with the British Supreme Court for China was filed by Professor Bentwich of the Department of International Relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Ms. Florence, a director of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The two announced in a telegram to British Foreign Secretary Halifax on Thursday night that they would file the petition and requested that no steps be taken "beyond the law" for the period required to obtain the writ.</p>
<h3>Authorities Decide to Maintain Rice Prices; Rumors of Price Controls; Rumors of Purchasing Foreign Rice for Temporary Supply; Attempted Rice Looting on Rue Robert</h3>
<p>Since the bean and rice industry union and the rice merchants' association submitted a petition to the concession authorities to provide relief for the food supply of the five million citizens in the Shanghai concessions and proposed two measures: (1) to dredge the sources of domestic rice, and (2) to purchase foreign rice for supply, and at the same time sent personnel to explain everything to the concession authorities, it is rumored that the concession authorities are determined to maintain the food supply and will temporarily order 100,000 bags of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for supply. It is heard that it has been submitted to the Rice and Grain Management Committee for consideration and will be handed over to the rice industry for price controls upon arrival.</p>
<p>Miserable Management, Supplementary Sale of Grains</p>
<p>The city's more than 800 rice shops have generally run out of stock and are in a very difficult situation. It is heard that some have ceased operations out of necessity. It is rumored that a small number of rice shops will sell all their goods first, with prices at 20 yuan per picul. However, they are waiting for a good price to emerge for the highest quality white rice. Upon hearing the news, the authorities secretly investigated and will severely punish them as soon as they are found to be true. Now, all rice shops, regardless of size, will sell miscellaneous grains from now on to maintain business and meet market demand, and prices will be set at standard market prices, not privately. This measure has been announced to the industry by the industry association, and it is hoped that flour merchants will not follow suit, hoarding and raising prices.</p>
<p>Authorities Protect Rice Shops</p>
<p>The two concession authorities had previously formally announced that they would protect operating rice shops within the area under their police jurisdiction to maintain the business of legitimate merchants and to affect the security within the concession. However, in recent days, due to the rampant black market and rising rice prices, the food supply of Shanghai citizens has reached a serious stage. A group of ignorant and foolish people, thinking foolishly, attempted to loot rice on Rue Robert in western Shanghai yesterday. However, the nearby police were informed and dispersed them, and it was safely resolved. Now, the police have been paying close attention.</p>
<p>Daily Investigation, Door-to-Door Market Prices</p>
<p>The market prices of various goods in the bean and rice market are set by the two concession authorities in conjunction with the leaders of the rice industry at a standard price limit of 16 yuan and 20 yuan, and the amount of market transactions must be reported daily. Subsequently, due to the scarcity of sources from various places and the decreasing reserves, hoarders firmly refused to release their goods. Now, in order to stabilize people's hearts and maintain the food supply, the two concession authorities, in addition to sending detectives to supervise the market every morning, are intensifying their investigation of the daily door-to-door market prices of the more than 800 rice shops within the concession. All rice shops must hang market price signs in front of their doors, and they are also doing their best to persuade them to maintain the status quo and sell as much rice as possible at the limited price. It is heard that the rice shops are all complying with the advice, but it is hoped that the authorities will crack down on the black market.</p>
<h3>Fractional Currency Will Be Printed; Issued by Central Bank Shanghai Branch; Only Applicable to Shanghai City</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance approved the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and ordered the Central Bank Printing Bureau to print 1-cent and 5-cent fractional currency notes, the Central Bank has signed a printing contract with the Yong Ning Printing Company in Hong Kong, with a total of 300,000 yuan for 1-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for 5-cent notes. According to the contract, delivery is 20 days. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the fractional currency notes will be printed and issued by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and will only be applicable to Shanghai City. The reserve is fully legal tender, and it can be issued before the end of this month. At that time, the bank will issue a public announcement to inform the public, and the style will be published in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Brisk Sales of Chinese Tea, Decline of Japanese Tea: Broad Prospects for Sales of Chinese Black Tea, Japanese Tea Farmers Lament</h3>
<p>This year, the production of black and green tea from Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces has broken previous records due to favorable rainfall. Recently, foreign firms dealing with Morocco, Singapore, Java, and various European and American countries have placed numerous orders for tea, mostly black tea, with a smaller amount of green tea. The delivery point for these orders is generally Hong Kong. However, due to the large volume of shipments, transportation has been unable to keep pace. In the past few years, the production of Japanese tea had fallen far behind. Subsequently, in an attempt to seize our overseas markets, Japan worked hard to improve its technology, and its tea production became almost equal to ours. However, since the invasion of China began the year before last, people in various countries have sympathized with our resistance, directly donating medicines and indirectly boycotting Japanese goods. Japanese tea is naturally no exception. This year, Japanese black tea exports are reportedly less than 30 or 40 percent of previous years, leading to overproduction and widespread lament among tea farmers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Return Patrol Vessel, "Lianxing" Undergoes Sea Trials in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Datong News Agency, after the Japanese returned the patrol vessel "Lianxing," the Jianghai Customs Maritime Affairs Bureau conducted sea trials in the Huangpu River a few days ago. The results showed that the vessel was undamaged. Therefore, naval personnel and customs officers will be dispatched to the ship within the next few days to perform anti-smuggling duties. Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs' anti-smuggling launches, including the "Jingjiang" and two others, which were returned by the Japanese last spring, are currently operating in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Little Hope for Return of Detained Portuguese Vessels: One Sold to the Japanese, Portuguese Consul's Negotiations for Release Apparently Fail: "Baud" Sold, "Lud" Returned to Japanese Management</h3>
<p>Twelve Portuguese merchant ships, including the "Tanglu," "Tangqiao," and "Tangbei," were illegally detained by the Japanese navy in early April of this year. Former Portuguese Consul Aires' negotiations for their release proved ineffective. Later, Aires was transferred from Shanghai, and the case was taken over by the new Consul Melo. After an initial pause, the new Consul Melo continued to negotiate with the Japanese authorities for their release, but to no avail. At that time, the new Consul reported the situation to his home government, requesting a solution through diplomatic channels. However, as of now, these negotiations have apparently failed. The detained Portuguese vessels are still being held by the Japanese navy in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River. It is said that the Japanese have individually notified the owners of each vessel in writing, putting pressure on them to quickly sell the ships to the Japanese, and demanding that they respect the wishes of the Japanese and abandon their prejudices before the end of August. The detained Portuguese vessels were only carrying goods and traveling between Ningbo, Oujiang, Haimen, and other navigable ports, as the Chinese seas were blockaded by the Japanese. There was nothing illegal about their activities. According to news from the Portuguese Consul on the evening of the 12th, there was still no progress regarding the detained merchant ships, despite negotiations. The Japanese side also rejected the Portuguese Consul's request to release half of the detained vessels. The reason why the Portuguese Consul could not obtain a satisfactory result is that Portugal is not a powerful nation. This is evidenced by the fact that German and Italian merchant ships, once detained, can be released after negotiations. The currently detained Portuguese vessels include the "Tanglu," "Tangbei," "Tangqiao," "Hailong," "Meida," "Fulu," "Dade," "Feide," "Feihua," "Libei," "Baud," and "Lud." Among them, the "Baud" has been decided to be sold to the Japanese, and the "Lud" will also be operated by a Japanese shipping company.</p>
<p>The "Continental News" reported yesterday (the 12th) that there are currently more than ten coastal vessels and motorboats flying the flags of five European countries outside Wusongkou. A Japanese warship is anchored alongside them, threatening them with cannons to prevent them from escaping. Some have been detained for as long as four months. Recently, fewer new ships have been detained and docked in that area, as shipowners would rather stop operating than risk confiscation. The reason given by the Japanese authorities for this action is that these ships are transporting supplies and ammunition to guerrillas, or because they are "dissatisfied with the identity of the ships." However, according to the shipowners here, the Japanese want to lease or buy all coastal vessels. The crew members of these ships have either been dismissed or are in danger of losing their jobs. It is heard that the Portuguese Consul's discussions with the Japanese navy on the release of the vessels are progressing slowly. The latest development is that the Japanese navy suggests that the ships be released, operated under the Portuguese flag for four months, and then "voluntarily" sold to Japanese companies. Another report says that the Japanese side will lease all the ships. It is heard that previous discussions were suspended because the Japanese side proposed releasing half of the Portuguese ships and confiscating the other half, which was explicitly rejected by the Portuguese Consul. Another piece of news said that the shipowners are willing to donate "gifts" to the Japanese Red Cross Society in exchange for the freedom of their ships, but this was also rejected by the Japanese side. The Portuguese community in Shanghai is very resentful of the discrimination shown by the Japanese, as German and Italian ships engaged in coastal trade are sometimes detained, but released after a day or two.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Organizations Agree on Transaction Methods: Transactions Limited to Chinese Nationals, Delivery Limited to Spot Goods</h3>
<p>After receiving an order from the Economic Capital to crack down on cotton yarn speculation in the market, the two cotton yarn organizations in this city notified all member manufacturers to comply. However, the two organizations believe that the purpose of this order is to curb speculation and promote domestic yarn, not to absolutely prohibit trading. Therefore, they discussed and decided that future transactions between member manufacturers should be limited to the following three principles: (1) Buyers and sellers must be Chinese nationals; (2) Transactions are limited to domestic yarn; (3) Delivery is limited to spot goods. Anyone who violates the above principles may be reported to the guild or administrative authorities at any time for investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Association Appeals to Divert Taoist Ritual Funds to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association issued a public notice, stating that during the Ghost Festival, there is a custom of performing Taoist rituals. In normal times, these rituals are considered harmless decorations, even if they are superstitious. However, in these times of turmoil and famine, with refugees everywhere, people do not even have enough to eat, let alone ghosts. The ancients said that saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda, which shows that the merit of saving people is higher than everything else. Today, there are many people in need of rescue in the various shelters, suffering from hunger and sorrow, and urgently awaiting assistance. Why bother ignoring the near and seeking merit in a distant and unknowable realm? Therefore, we appeal to all public offices, guilds, neighborhood residents in this city to divert the funds for Taoist rituals to save refugees. One practical action is better than a thousand empty words, and the merit is truly immeasurable. On behalf of the refugees, we implore you. If you agree, please send your donations to our association, and we will issue receipts and publish acknowledgments in the newspapers. This is a special notice, and we hope for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Increased Cigarette Prices Lead to Sharp Drop in Business: Awaiting Reopening of Sea Ports for Better Sales</h3>
<p>A reporter from "New Voice News" visited Mr. Qu Zhenhua, a magnate in the Chinese cigarette industry, yesterday. According to Mr. Qu, among the Chinese cigarette factories in this city, the Huacheng Cigarette Company has the strongest capital, largest scale, and most diverse products. Next are the Fuxing Nanyang and others. Since the Ministry of Finance decided to prohibit the import of non-essential goods, the Chinese cigarette industry has suffered a huge blow. In addition, the closure of seaports everywhere has suspended sales to other regions, and the industry relies solely on sales in this city. Moreover, the cost of raw tobacco is high, increasing costs. Business is bleak, and there has been a sharp decline. Therefore, it has been necessary to reduce production and wait for the gradual restoration of transportation in various regions and the reopening of seaports for better sales. However, the current situation is more difficult. Therefore, the prices of all products have been increased from yesterday.</p>
<h3>After Rogers' Departure for Hong Kong, the Black Market Exchange Rate Eases: May Instruct HSBC to Continue Maintaining the Rate, Results of Hong Kong Meeting to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange and gold markets have been manipulated by speculators, creating an abnormal situation. The drastic contraction of the black market foreign exchange and the soaring price of gold are all caused by speculative manipulation, and have no impact on the entire Chinese economic structure. However, although the contraction of the black market foreign exchange is beneficial to China, the lives of some people in Shanghai are affected. It is heard that the Equalization Fund Committee has paid considerable attention to the black market in Shanghai and will take measures to stabilize it if necessary. After Mr. Rogers, the British member of the committee, arrived in Shanghai, he discussed the matter with the managers of HSBC and Chartered Bank. Although he has now left for Hong Kong, it is generally believed in the market that after Mr. Rogers returns to Hong Kong, he will consult with Xu Kan, the Minister of Finance, and Bei Songsun, a member of the committee, and may instruct HSBC to continue maintaining the black market foreign exchange rate in Shanghai. Therefore, the black market in Shanghai suddenly eased from last Saturday, and the underground gold market followed suit. Therefore, it is expected that the black market foreign exchange rate will stabilize in the future.</p>

<h3>National Government Issues Order to Prevent Smuggling: Gold, Silver, and Banknotes are Prohibited Items, Groups Operating or Harboring Smuggling Subject to Military Law, Travelers Allowed to Carry One Ounce of Gold and Five Ounces of Silver</h3>
<p>After the National Government made great efforts to adjust international trade, the customs offices in non-occupied areas have seen a surplus in foreign trade, which is a sign of the success of the government's policy of encouraging exports under exchange control. Now, it has promulgated measures to prevent the import and export of special goods by land, sea, and air, dispatching police to assist in the investigation and prevention of smuggling, and stipulating the amount of gold, silver, and banknotes that can be carried. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dispatch Police to Investigate Smuggling</p>
<p>Goods prohibited from export that are smuggled will be confiscated and penalized in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. Goods subject to foreign exchange settlement that are not settled in accordance with regulations will be treated as smuggled goods and penalized in accordance with the various provisions of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. If a group is organized to operate or harbor smuggling, and the quantity is large, in addition to confiscating all the goods, the relevant personnel will be reported to the military law organs or courts for severe punishment in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Finance has allocated tax police to be stationed in designated locations, under the command and dispatch of the customs, and dispatched to the customs officers to perform the duty of assisting in the investigation and handling of smuggled goods at the inspection sites.</p>
<p>Regulations on Carrying Gold, Silver, and Banknotes</p>
<p>Regarding gold and silver, unless specially permitted by the Ministry of Finance and holding a passport, or holding a certificate for the transportation of gold and silver from the gold and silver exchange office of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Farmers Bank of China, it is not allowed to be declared for transportation. Gold products are only allowed to be carried by travelers, and the amount carried by each person shall not exceed 37.7994 grams of pure gold, which is one tael by customs scales. Silver products can be declared for transport by businesses after applying for a passport from the Ministry of Finance. Each traveler is allowed to carry no more than 188.9997 grams of pure silver, which is five taels by customs scales. Travelers are allowed to carry banknotes of 500 yuan per person, and foreign banknotes are limited to the equivalent of 500 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Fake Companies to Carry Out Scams: Feng Jianqing Colludes with Others to Misappropriate Silk, Fortunately, Early Detection Led to Recovery of the Original Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>Feng Jianqing, a young man from Hangzhou, recently set up a fake Huizhong Trade Transportation Company in the Toufa Lane area of Hangzhou, claiming to transport goods for customers, but in reality, he was carrying out scams. Among them, silk merchants suffered the most. A silk merchant broker from Hangzhou named Lu Baoquan, who is over sixty years old and has white hair and beard, entrusted Feng to transport 30 pieces of silk materials to Shanghai on the 26th of last month. However, Feng colluded with accomplices Jin Guorong, Zhu Donghai, Wu Kangyang, and Feng's mistress, and secretly transported all of Lu's silk materials to the Suzhou and Wuxi areas for sale. Lu chased them to Wuxi, reported to the police, and intercepted the two accomplices Jin and Zhu, and recovered 20 pieces of the original stolen goods. Feng fled without a trace. In this time of unrest, it is hoped that merchants everywhere will pay special attention to this.</p>
<h3>Seventh Installment of Rehabilitation Bonds, Four Banks Provide Discount Payment at the End of the Month, Interest Payment on National Salvation Bonds Not Yet Ordered</h3>
<p>In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance, after drawing lots to repay the principal of domestic debts as usual, consulted with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and agreed that the four banks would provide discount payments for the United Rehabilitation Gold Bonds guaranteed by customs duties. The principal and interest of the seventh installment of the Rehabilitation Bonds, totaling 11,594,000 yuan, which is due at the end of August, will be discounted and paid by the four banks at that time, which is the same as the unified method. Shanghai will pay it off in six installments. In addition, according to regulations, 20 million yuan for the second interest payment of the National Salvation Bonds should be paid at the end of August, but the Central Bank has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>High Tide to Occur in Huangpu River Starting Midnight Today: Only One Foot and a Few Inches from the Bund Embankment, High Tide on the Morning of the 17th May Flood the Land</h3>
<p>The first high tide of the year in the Huangpu River will suddenly occur at midnight today (the zero hour before the morning of the 15th), reaching a height of 11 feet 7 inches, which is only one foot and three inches from the Bund embankment, extremely close. The high tide at 0:50 PM on the 15th will be 10 feet 5 inches. The morning tide on the 16th will rise to more than 12 feet, and the afternoon tide will also rise to nearly 12 feet. It is expected that the tide at 1:33 AM on the morning of the 17th will reach 13 feet 1.5 inches, and the afternoon tide will also be close to 12 feet. The quantity of the morning tide on that day will exceed the Bund embankment, and the distance between the afternoon tide and the shore will be minimal. Therefore, flooding is inevitable. From the 18th to the 21st, both the morning and afternoon tides will fluctuate between 12 feet and 11 feet. During this period, low-lying roads will inevitably be flooded, causing great inconvenience for pedestrians. If there is wind and rain, the areas along the Bund will see the river water surging and flooding the land. If the wharves along the Huangpu River are not equipped with flood control facilities, there is a risk of flooding. From the 22nd, the tide will begin to recede to below 10 feet, returning to the proper water level.</p>
<h3>Playboy Swindler Jiang Jianqiu Files an Appeal: Believes Original Sentence is Too Heavy</h3>
<p>The playboy thief Jiang Jianqiu is adept at seducing women. He has committed numerous crimes in the two concessions of this city. Those who have been deceived out of their virginity and money include not only prostitutes, dancers, and guides, but also concubines from wealthy families and Kunqu opera actresses. After Jiang was arrested in May of this year for the case, the actress Mao Jianqiu confronted Jiang in court. Jiang testified that Mao Jianqiu was not deceived by him. However, the Kunqu opera actresses Yu Guifen and Yao Yuchan, and the wealthy concubine Zhou Jinxiang, were unwilling to confront Jiang. Jiang confessed to dozens of cases in the First and Second Special District Courts. The First Special Court sentenced Jiang to a total of five years in prison for fraud and theft. The Second Special Court sentenced Jiang to nine years in prison for robbery only. It is known that Jiang has expressed his willingness to accept the judgment of the First Special Court, but believes that the judgment of the Second Special Court is too heavy. He has now hired lawyer Zhang Danping to file an appeal with the High Court, requesting a reduction in the sentence.</p>
<h3>Water Levels Rising in the Yangtze River Basin: Night Navigation Extremely Difficult</h3>
<p>The upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have recently reported rising water levels due to the flood season. Snowmelt from the Kunlun Mountains and the Jinsha River in the upper reaches is causing flooding. The riverbanks are collapsing in many places, so navigation must be done at a reduced speed, and night navigation is extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Advancing Rapidly in the Pacific Ocean: Wind May Affect Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Pacific hurricane is currently advancing rapidly in a west-northwesterly direction, threatening the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. If the direction does not change, Shanghai will be disturbed by the edge of the storm. At the same time, the Huangpu River will have high tides starting on the 15th, so extra attention should be paid. The hurricane is currently less than 500 nautical miles from Shanghai. In the event that the wind turns to the northwest, Shanghai will be directly hit.</p>
<h3>Silk Thieves Arrested: Large Quantity of Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>Wei Zhengquan and Zhang Mengwei (also known as Zhang Shan), both from Ningbo, are employees of the Xieji Transportation Company opened by Chuan Xiaofu. At 3:00 PM on the 14th of last month, they stole 165 pieces of double crepe, net buckle spinning, and foreign spinning (worth 2,100 yuan) from the warehouse at No. 59 Hongren Lane, Tianjin Road, and fled. They entrusted silk cloth broker Chen Jiayun to sell them to the Xinyuanxiang Silk Shop on Nanjing Road. Chuan learned of this, reported it to the police, and arrested Wei Zhengquan and others, recovering 122 pieces of the stolen goods. They were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and prosecuted separately for theft and possession of stolen goods. Judge Feng presided over the hearing. Because the plaintiff requested a postponement to continue to recover the stolen goods, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>
<h3>Modern Girl Attempts Suicide: Seen at Cabarets and Dance Halls, Driven to Despair by Mother's Reprimand</h3>
<p>Bi Lingling, a local girl of 19, resides at No. 9 Ren'an Lane, Songshan Road, in the French Concession. Her family is wealthy and lives a comfortable life. However, Bi loves to dress up and is often seen at cabarets and dance halls. She is articulate and good at socializing, which attracts the attention of frivolous young men. Her mother, however, adheres to traditional etiquette and believes that Lingling's actions are contrary to the virtues of a woman. She is dissatisfied and has repeatedly admonished her, but her daughter has been accustomed to a romantic lifestyle for so long that her efforts have been ineffective. The night before last, Bi returned home late at night and was severely reprimanded by her mother, who then forbade her from going out. Lingling, upon hearing these words, felt like she was trapped in a cage, losing her freedom. She tossed and turned half the night, unable to sleep. Until about 9:00 AM the next morning, Lingling had the idea of death. She secretly took a large amount of cigarette ash and nine sleeping pills, and swallowed them without anyone noticing, lying down on the bed with her clothes on, hoping for the advent of death. However, due to taking too much poison, she soon experienced a violent outbreak of toxicity, vomiting violently and moaning incessantly. Her mother discovered her and quickly sent her to the hospital for treatment by car. Although doctors diagnosed her condition, she had not yet emerged from the danger zone by late at night.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Control Vegetables in Pudong: Rumor that Starting from the 16th, Purchases Must Be Made at Hongkou</h3>
<p>The vegetables and produce needed for daily food in this city, except for a small amount grown in western Shanghai, mostly come from Pudong. Yesterday, a notice was posted in Pudong stating that due to the establishment of a produce market in Hongkou, the sale and purchase of vegetables and produce will be controlled from the 16th of this month. All villagers who carry vegetables to the concessions every day used to take the ferry at the Dongchang Road pier, or the ferry at the South Pier to the Bund on Sanma Road. From the 16th, they must all take the ferry at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to the Hongkou market. Vegetable stall owners in the concessions must purchase from Hongkou. In the future, there will be no men and women from Pudong selling vegetables in the concession markets. The Qichang Wharf ferry is operated by the Nissin Company. Currently, food has been controlled at the Rice Market Ferry and Qingpu, and meat is also controlled at the Hongkou Livestock Market. Now, vegetables are controlled, and the purpose is nothing more than to disrupt the lives of residents in the two concessions.</p>
<h3>Three Postal Ships to Depart Shanghai Tomorrow: President Taft, Guangdong, President Doumer</h3>

It has now returned from Manila and has passed Hong Kong. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon today, mooring at buoys 12 and 13. The ship is scheduled to weigh anchor at 7:00 AM tomorrow (the 15th), returning to Los Angeles via Japan. The British Company's regular postal ship Guangdong arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd of last month from London. It departed Shanghai for Japan on the 25th and returned to Shanghai from Japan yesterday (the 13th), mooring at buoys 11 and 12. It is scheduled to leave port at 2:30 PM tomorrow (the 15th), returning to London via Hong Kong, Singapore, and various parts of Southeast Asia. The French postal ship President Doumer arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month from Marseille, departed for Japan on the 7th, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Japan today, returning to Marseille from Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Two Painters Electrocuted</h3>
<p>A new building is being constructed in Zhuanbang, Daxilu, western Shanghai. Yesterday, at around 4:30 PM, a painter named An Qiao, 27 years old, from Yangzhou, was painting a wall when he accidentally touched an AC power line on the wall. He was immediately stunned and lost consciousness. At that time, the painting foreman Cheng Anguang (33 years old, from Jiashan) saw him and tried to help him down, but also accidentally touched the power line and collapsed. They were both sent to the Red Cross Hospital, but all treatments were ineffective and they were both pronounced dead.</p>
<h3>Reporter Qu Shao-yi's Assassination Attempt Case: Assailant Sentenced to Eight Years, Claim of Revenge Difficult to Believe</h3>
<p>Lawyer Qu Yue (Zi Shao-yi), also an editor at this newspaper, was attacked on the morning of June 17th this year by Chen Rongji (also known as Chen Yongji), a man he did not know, who carried a gun to his home at No. 38, Lane 16, Meibai Ge Road. One bullet slightly wounded Lawyer Qu's right buttocks, while the second bullet was jammed. The attacker was arrested on the spot. During the police investigation, the attacker Chen confessed that he was avenging Wang Mingde because Wang's father had a dispute with Lawyer Qu over family matters. On the 12th, the case was tried in the First Special District Court. Because the judge declared that bystanders were prohibited from attending, the details of the trial could not be recorded. After the trial, the reporter learned that Judge Fu Lin, the judge presiding over the case, questioned Chen in detail about the claim that he was avenging a friend. Chen's answers were extremely vague and evasive, and he could not provide a detailed explanation. Therefore, his previous claim of avenging Wang Mingde was difficult to believe. After Judge Fu questioned him in detail, he gave the verdict: Chen Rongji was sentenced to eight years in prison, deprived of his civil rights for ten years, and the seized pistol and five bullets were confiscated. After the trial, the reporter visited Lawyer Qu. According to him, he had not handled any cases like the one Chen claimed in the past few years, so there was no basis for the claim of a feud. Therefore, it is speculated that Chen's motive for killing Lawyer Qu may have been something else, and the claim of avenging a friend was just a smokescreen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Claim Hongqiao is Peaceful</h3>
<p>The "Continental News" reported that the Japanese military spokesman claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 12th) that residents of the Hongqiao area will enjoy tranquility starting today because the threat from Chinese guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai has finally been eliminated by the Japanese army. However, it is unavoidable that isolated "bandits" may appear and gunfire may be heard. This month, the Japanese army and guerrillas have fought ten times on Chongming Island, Jiading, Luodian, the Hongqiao Airport, and Pudong.</p>
<h3>Landlord and Tenant in Dispute, Tenant Loses Both Cases</h3>
<p>Tao Xueseng, also known as Tao Jianhua, a man from Pudong, has been renting at No. 578 Xiafei Road for many years. Because the lease was for a fixed term, the owner Sun Wenquan filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting that Tao be ordered to move out, claiming the lease had expired. The first trial ruled against Sun Wenquan. On appeal to the High Court, the result was that Tao should move out. At the same time, Tao filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Sun Wenquan of defamation. Lawyer Sun Qiying wrote the complaint on his behalf, saying that Sun called him a guerrilla commander, which slandered his reputation and requested that Sun Wenquan be punished for the crime he deserved. The case has been adjudicated by Judge Li Weishan. A verdict was announced yesterday that Sun Wenquan was not guilty. It is said that Tao has no recourse for the failure of the eviction lawsuit. However, he is unwilling to accept the defeat in the criminal defamation case and will appeal to the High Court.</p>

During the search, they discovered that four guide agencies had been set up in the hotel, and there was a police officer in charge. They arrested seven men and women from the agencies and four guides and took them to the police station for punishment. The main reason for searching the hotel was that the Police Department had received a secret report beforehand that unstable elements were hiding in the hotel.</p>

<h3>Transporting Goods into the Interior: Saigon as an Alternative</h3>
<p>— Jingxin</p>
<p>In the past, Haiphong was the only route for transporting goods into the interior. Haiphong was not originally a major trading port, but once it suddenly became an important international transportation hub, it was overwhelmed. The management of warehouses, customs clearance procedures, and train loading methods in that area was very chaotic, causing general merchants to complain. Recently, the number of goods stockpiled in that port but not yet shipped is countless. If goods continue to be shipped there, the delay will be even harder to predict. According to recent news from the transportation industry, goods destined for the interior can be routed through Saigon instead of Haiphong. The various costs and routes along the way are detailed below:</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Saigon, there are ships operated by Butterfield &amp; Swire and French Mail Steamship Company. The freight rate for Butterfield &amp; Swire is 33 Hong Kong dollars per ton, and for French Mail, it is 27.5 Hong Kong dollars. When entering Saigon, a transit tax must be paid. For domestic goods shipped from mainland China via Hong Kong or Shanghai, the transit tax rate is 1%, but the value of the goods must be estimated by the local customs. For foreign goods, it is 4% of the value. Saigon's warehouse facilities are better than Haiphong's. For goods stored in warehouses for up to ten days (excluding Sundays and holidays), there is no charge. From the eleventh day, the warehouse rental fee is 0.2 Vietnamese currency per ton per cubic meter, and thereafter it is calculated at 0.1 Vietnamese currency per day. If the goods have been stored in the warehouse for more than 30 days and have not yet been loaded onto the train, they must be moved to the open space of the train platform, and the daily charge is 0.03 Vietnamese currency per ton. The local handling fee for goods from the ship to the warehouse or train is 1.2 Vietnamese currency per ton, from the pier to the warehouse or train is 0.8 Vietnamese currency per ton, and from the warehouse to the train is also 0.8 Vietnamese currency per ton. As for the train freight from Saigon to Hanoi, there are two types: "Ordinary Tariff" and "General Tariff". The difference lies in the speed of obtaining vehicles. Those who pay the special tariff can get vehicles first for early loading, while those who pay the ordinary tariff must wait for allocation, resulting in a later vehicle allocation. Therefore, those who want early loading are willing to pay the special tariff. The freight rate from Saigon to Hanoi is calculated per ton of a ten-ton vehicle. For general cargo, the "Special Tariff" is 161.96 Vietnamese currency, and the "Ordinary Tariff" is 45.07 Vietnamese currency. For cotton yarn and flammable goods, the special tariff is 116.54 Vietnamese currency per ton. For general explosive and dangerous goods, 324 Vietnamese currency per ton is required. As for the freight rate from Hanoi to Kunming, each ten-ton vehicle costs 1002.8 Vietnamese currency.</p>
<p>From Saigon via Hanoi, if the situation is good, the entire journey takes 20 to 30 days. If you travel from Saigon along the Vietnam National Railway to Đồng Đăng on the border between Annam and Guangxi, it is easier to get a vehicle. The freight rate for each ton of cargo in a ten-ton vehicle is: general cargo, ordinary 48.75 Vietnamese currency, special 180.37 Vietnamese currency; cotton yarn, 129.74 Vietnamese currency per ton; explosives, 360 Vietnamese currency per ton. For those who have trucks ready to load goods on the Sino-Vietnamese border, it is advisable to take the Đồng Đăng route and transfer to the interior. Recently, various transportation agencies in this city have found that the transportation situation via Saigon is quite good, so they have been actively handling this type of transportation.</p>
<h3>Xiang-Gui Railway Extended to Yongfu</h3>
<p>— (Sheng)</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway starts from Hengyang, Hunan, and goes directly to Guilin, Guangxi Province. After the railway bureau's efforts to build, it was opened to Liuzhou in April of this year, as reported in the 9th issue of this publication. We have now received a communication from Guilin stating that the Guilin-Liuzhou section has been extended to Yongfu, a distance of 45 kilometers, with fares of 1 National currency for third class, 2 National currency for second class, and 3 National currency for first class.</p>
<h3>Brief Explanation of Cargo Retrieval Procedures</h3>
<p>— (Feng Wenzhuo)</p>
<p>The so-called cargo retrieval refers to the extraction of cargo from its storage location based on the cargo owner's warehouse receipt. Although the matter is simple and easy to do, the responsibilities of the cargo retriever are very important. If there is any oversight, it is difficult to avoid the risk of compensation. Therefore, cargo retrievers should not engage in this work rashly without sufficient experience.</p>
<p>After receiving the bill of lading, the cargo retriever should first pay attention to the location of the cargo and whether the back of the bill of lading has the necessary signature or seal of the cargo owner. Then, he/she should check whether the company indicated on the bill of lading to submit the goods has signed or sealed. After that, he/she should go to the pier warehouse where the goods are located to retrieve the goods. When retrieving the goods, the bill of lading should first be signed and stamped with the customs seal at the customs office stationed at the pier. However, sometimes, because the import manifest (PP) has not yet been sent by the Jianghai Customs, the office will not allow the seal to be stamped. If the goods to be retrieved are very urgent, the customs broker can be requested to apply to the Jianghai Customs for the import manifest, attach it to the bill of lading, and go to the pier customs office for stamping. Then, go to the pier's main office to sign and exchange the original bill of lading (i.e., the Chinese-style warehouse receipt issued by the pier authorities and delivered to the pier warehouse personnel, but some piers do not have this bill of lading exchange procedure). When signing at the pier office, you can conveniently inquire about the warehouse number where the goods are stacked and the expiration date of the warehouse rent (according to the current regulations of various shipping companies, the limit is ten days from the date the ship docks). If the warehouse rent is on the last day of its term on the retrieval date, the cargo retriever must quickly retrieve all the goods on the same day. If other complications arise that prevent retrieval, the cargo owner should be informed of the above situation and difficulties to avoid being burdened with paying warehouse rent. What should be paid special attention to is whether the markings (i.e., the marks) on each piece of the extracted cargo match the markings recorded on the bill of lading. There must be no errors. Also, if damaged or missing goods are found and the goods cannot be retrieved immediately, the cargo owner should be consulted immediately before a decision can be made; otherwise, the responsibilities will be greater and there will be more entanglements.</p>
<p>The above is just a common knowledge of piers and warehouses. Although the cargo retrieval procedures at each pier are slightly different, the general framework is nothing more than the above.</p>
<p>As for the procedures for customs warehouses, foreign warehouses, bank warehouses, factory warehouses, and waste product inspections, I will take the time to report on them later.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Commends Huang Xiaolian, a Student of Huaxi University Who Died in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>(Chengdu News) Recently, when Chengdu was bombed, the five universities in Huaxiba were also affected. Huang Xiaolian, a student of Huaxi University and a member of the joint rescue team, died in the line of duty. The Ministry of Education has sent a telegram of commendation. It is learned that the Chengdu Executive Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission has also issued an order of commendation, the original text of which is as follows: "Upon investigation, Huang Xiaolian, a student of Huaxi University and a member of the joint rescue team of the five universities in Huaxiba, went to the rescue with the team when Chengdu was recently bombed and was shot and killed. The student went to the righteous cause without fear of falling behind, exhausted his life in times of extreme hardship, and did not change his intention, tragically following in the footsteps of those who sacrifice themselves. His heroic spirit is no different from those who charge forward and break through enemy lines on the front lines. Moreover, as a woman, this is truly commendable. It is worthy of praise, and it is ordered that a commendation be issued to encourage and inspire."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Actively Compiles and Reviews Mass Readings; A Group for Compiling and Reviewing Mass Readings is Established Under the Textbook Committee</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Mass readings are the spiritual food of the general public and are extremely important. The Ministry of Education has, in previous years, collected and reviewed mass readings popular in the market and found that there were many bad readings that urgently needed to be banned, and that applicable readings should be compiled and printed for the public to read. Thus, in 1936, it began to work on a planned compilation and review. The purpose is to enable the public with a level of education equivalent to that of graduates of mass schools to continue to be educated through a wide range of simple and interesting readings, thereby promoting national consciousness, cultivating national morality, instilling scientific knowledge, and enhancing practical knowledge. The principles of compilation, in terms of content, must be able to arouse the public's enthusiasm and must not cause negative, pessimistic, romantic, isolated, or cowardly influences. In terms of writing style, simple and clear vernacular language is the main focus, and it is based on commonly used words by the public. Uncommon words are not used unless absolutely necessary. Except for lyrics, each topic is limited to one book, and each book is based on 8,000 to 15,000 words. All text must be added with new-style punctuation marks. The types of compilation are temporarily divided into three categories: (1) Popular Science Library, for supplementing the public's various common sense; the content includes Party principles, society, nature, self-cultivation, and application; (2) Illustrated Readings, for instilling common sense to the public who are not very literate; the content is divided into categories that are the same as the Popular Science Library, and is drawn with simple and vivid pictures; the inserted text is shallow and concise; (3) National Literature and Art, for providing the public with leisure reading, with the purpose of cultivating the mind and stimulating public awareness; all excellent words and deeds of famous people in ancient and modern times, patriotic historical facts, and valuable legends from the people are selected as themes. The style includes novels, stories, dramas (such as Peking opera, Kun opera, local operas), drum books, lyrics (folk songs, Taoist songs, Lianhualuo), and short tunes. In addition to the above three types, in order to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance, a series of Popular Books for the Extraordinary Period is added to strengthen the will to resist the war and supplement common sense about the war. In addition to the Ministry of Education assigning personnel to be responsible for editing based on the list of mass readings, manuscripts are solicited publicly. Those adopted after review will be rewarded with cash. In the past two years, in addition to the countless types of readings purchased from the market for review, more than 230 types of self-edited manuscripts and solicited manuscripts have been received, and more than 170 types have been adopted. More than 70 types of the above adopted manuscripts have been printed, and the rest are still in printing. Recently, the Ministry of Education, in order to promote social education during the war, has seen that mass readings are even more important. Therefore, under the Textbook Editorial Committee, a mass readings group has been specially established to be responsible for the compilation and review of mass readings.</p>

The junior high school focuses on basic subjects, the senior high school focuses on mathematics, physics, chemistry, and English, and the normal school focuses on Chinese language and applied subjects, so that graduates can serve the community. Tuition fees remain the same as before: 23 yuan for junior high school, 27 yuan for senior high school, and 17 yuan for normal school, with no miscellaneous fees. The school recently received Instruction No. 15486 from the Ministry of Education, which provided detailed guidance on the school's operating principles. It is scheduled to test new students tomorrow, and the number of applicants has been very crowded in recent days.</p>
<p>Minli Girls' High School: The school has a long history, strict management, and a well-established reputation. After the war, it rented No. 1192 Avenue Joffre and continued to hold classes in its original spirit. Recently, due to the large number of students, the original school building was insufficient. It has been rented at No. 612 Avenue Lafayette, the corner of Route Massenet, as a new school building. The building is being renovated these days, and it is planned to add three new houses next to the playground. Starting from the next semester, the enrollment quota will be expanded and classes will be held in the new school building. The third enrollment examination will be held on August 28. It is reported that there are still vacancies at all levels.</p>
<p>Songjiang Middle School: Since the school was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to move to Shanghai last year, it has adhered to its past operating principles, with strict teaching and management, and has achieved remarkable results. The students are very well-developed. This summer, it moved to the building at No. 46 Avenue Foch, and the number of students applying for enrollment has been even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Cao Yi Primary School: Cao Yi Primary School, located at No. 1081, Great Western Road, has been established for more than ten years. Unexpectedly, the school building was suddenly occupied ten days ago (August 3). In this special environment, the school decided to suspend operations. The teachers and staff of the school, as well as Director Yang, could not bear to see the students losing their schooling. After finding two new school buildings at Nos. 11 and 52, Xin Sen Lane, Caojiadu, they renamed the school "Caoji Primary School" and set the reopening date for the 18th of this month. All former "Cao Yi" students, as well as out-of-school children in the vicinity, can go to register.</p>
<p>Qiming Primary and Secondary School: Qiming Primary and Secondary School, located at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Jiaozhou Road, has added a junior high school this semester. The number of students applying for the examination is unusually crowded. The board of directors has donated 15 free and half-fee places, which are temporarily limited to Junior High School One. Qu Fangfeng has been hired as the director of education for the primary school, and Shen Zengxun, Zhou Longshen, and Ba Wei have been hired as tutors for each grade. The final enrollment will be held on the 20th.</p>
<p>Guohua Middle School: In addition to establishing a West School on Gordon Road, Guohua Middle School has also established an East School in the foreign-style houses at No. 318, Dong, Tongfu Road, Weihaiwei Road. It has now been set up, and important staff members have moved into the office starting yesterday. Junior and senior high school students can take the entrance examination and complete the admission procedures there. Tuition fees are 25 yuan for junior high school and 30 yuan for senior high school, which is the lowest in the eastern district.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Chinese Tennis Players Refuse to Compete with Siam to Protest the Oppression of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong, 13th) Siam has recently been continuously oppressing Chinese compatriots, and Hong Kong overseas Chinese miss their compatriots and are very resentful. The Siamese tennis team has come to Hong Kong to compete at this time, but Hong Kong overseas Chinese believe that Siam's attitude towards China is bad, and this is not the time for tennis competitions and celebrations. Therefore, they are indifferent to the competition. The Chinese representatives who were selected to participate in the competition have also refused to participate to express their protest against Siam and sympathize with the Siamese Chinese who are suffering.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on Diet at the End of Summer and Beginning of Autumn</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The seasons advance relentlessly, and we have entered the gentle embrace of early autumn. As the seasons change, so do the changes in the human body, especially in this period between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. The skin and stomach gradually shift from a state of relaxation to contraction. Therefore, during this period, we must be particularly careful about our diet to avoid falling prey to illnesses. For example, in the heat of summer, we can drink more cold drinks and eat more melons to moisten the intestines and relieve the heat. Now that autumn has arrived, cold drinks and fruits should be consumed in moderation, or even avoided altogether! This is because the stomach has begun to contract, and the introduction of raw and cold foods will inevitably lead to stagnation in the stomach. Over time, this can lead to dysentery. So, what should we eat during this time when the summer heat is not entirely gone and the new coolness is gradually arriving? In my humble opinion, melons should be completely eliminated! It is best to cook mung bean soup at home, adding a few red dates or fox nuts. The key is to use less ingredients and more water. After it cools, mix in peppermint water and white sugar. The soup will be clear, refreshing, and much better than the sour plum soup sold in stores! As for dishes, it is also necessary to choose foods that contain vitamins and are easy to digest, such as winter melon and preserved snow cabbage. Furthermore, it is better to eat more vegetables and less meat. Rich fish and meat are not suitable for this time. In order to maintain our health and prevent disease, we must be careful about our diet in advance.</p>
<p>While we can be careful in our daily diet and not indulge in gluttony, there are exceptions: For example, when attending a banquet with relatives and friends, the feast may be sumptuous, and the host may enthusiastically offer drinks. It may be difficult to refuse their kindness, and one may end up eating more than usual. In that case, you should take some simple hangover and stomach-clearing remedies to help digestion. Also, be careful at night when sleeping. If it is too hot before going to bed, one may be tempted to wear little clothing to stay cool. However, after midnight, it gets colder, and if you don't add more covers, the cold air will invade, hindering the digestion of food. Because there is a correlation, I am adding this note for everyone's attention.</p>
<h3>Talking About Slippers</h3>
<p>— Pusheng</p>
<p>After a bath, if we don't have slippers and put our shoes back on, we will definitely feel uncomfortable. Therefore, although slippers are very small and not worth mentioning, they are an indispensable item in the summer.</p>
<p>Slippers come in three types: leather, cloth, and straw. Leather slippers are the most expensive. Given the current soaring prices of leather, a pair costs at least one dollar and fifty cents or more, and are mostly used by the wealthy.</p>
<p>Cloth slippers are the most common. The upper is made of cloth or silk, embroidered with flowers and birds, and then fitted with a sole by a cobbler. Making a pair not only involves complicated procedures, but also costs a considerable amount.</p>
<p>Straw slippers are the cheapest, costing only about twenty cents a pair. They are produced in the Jiading Xujia Hang area. The locals rely on them for a living. They are woven from yellow grass. Because their cost is relatively low, the selling price is very low, and they are very comfortable to wear. They are truly inexpensive and good quality slippers. However, few people in Shanghai use them, and there are very few stores selling them. Is it because the production is low? Or is it because wearing them is considered detrimental to the image of Shanghainese? We do not know.</p>
<h3>Watermelon Recipes</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>There are many foods to relieve heat and quench thirst on the market today, especially cold drinks, which fill every corner of the city, but I think watermelon is still the best cooling food.</p>
<p>However, there are various ways to eat watermelon. Ordinary families cut the watermelon into small pieces and share it. Cutting a large watermelon into many small pieces causes a lot of the fresh, sweet juice to be lost, wetting the entire table, which is a pity. Therefore, it is best to cut the entire watermelon in half and then scoop out the flesh with a ladle. This prevents the juice from being lost. Some people think that this method is fine when there are few people, but not suitable when there are many people. However, I think that even with many people, you can use a ladle to divide the watermelon into bowls and eat it. Biting into a watermelon wedge will also cause a lot of juice to drip, but using a ladle is the most economical and effective way.</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai has become a world of ice. Electric refrigerators and ordinary refrigerators are found in most middle and upper-class homes. With a refrigerator at home, everything must be chilled, and watermelon is no exception. Frozen watermelon is indeed extra cold, but I think that watermelon that is too cold loses its original flavor when put in the mouth. It is better to soak it in well water or tap water for two or three hours before cutting it open, so it will not lose its original sweetness.</p>
<p>After eating the watermelon, most families casually throw away the seeds and rind, but those who are resourceful will not discard them. After washing the seeds and drying them in the sun, you can roast them at any time, add some salt, or eat them plain. They are much more fragrant and crispy than the watermelon seeds bought in the grocery store.</p>
<p>Not only are watermelon seeds delicious, but watermelon rind is also edible. If you leave some of the inner green flesh under the outer green skin, you can marinate it in soy sauce to make soy sauce watermelon rind, or marinate it in salt and dry it to make salted watermelon rind. Both can be used as side dishes for breakfast. Moreover, watermelon rind can be stir-fried, braised, or stewed in oil as a vegetarian dish. Clever housewives will even use watermelon rind as an accompaniment to meat dishes. So, whether it is watermelon seeds or watermelon rind, we can make use of them. Casually discarding them is uneconomical, especially today when watermelon prices are very high and everything is expensive.</p>
<h3>The Era of Small Vegetable Baskets</h3>
<p>— Zhi Mu</p>
<h3>Chatting About "Small Houses"</h3>
<p>— A Zi</p>
<p>The term "small house" is often heard in the city; the organization of "small houses" is also a unique expression of the city. Speaking of "small houses," one can also say that it is a branch of a family.</p>
<p>When a man and a woman love each other and live together in a time when it cannot be made public, it is called a "small house," which carries a sense of secrecy.</p>
<p>The most common "small house" in Shanghai is a room in a wing, on a floor, or in a garret, rented with a nanny, in addition to a man and a woman.</p>
<p>The time of a "small house" does not seem to be very long. The final result is either separation or a public union, which becomes a small family, or is merged into a family.</p>
<p>The "small house" is equipped with dishes that the male protagonist likes to eat, as well as the ambition and intention to lure the male protagonist to linger in his family and never return. But becoming a public small family is also what the female protagonist hopes for.</p>
<p>There is a type of "small house" that is like a hotel: the male and female protagonists set a time to meet here, usually closed tightly, or a nanny is sent to guard it.</p>
<p>The female protagonists of "small houses" come from all kinds of women in the city, whether prostitutes, other people's wives, young or old.</p>
<p>In the city, many "small houses" are destroyed, created, and exist.</p>

<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In last week's menu, I suggested several melon dishes, which I expect readers have already adopted. This week, I want to particularly recommend one of the most beautiful and more expensive melon dishes, called Winter Melon Soup. Readers who have been to Cantonese restaurants in the summer have certainly heard of it and have already tried it. However, the winter melon soup in Cantonese restaurants is delicious, but the price is also considerable. Eating one serving probably costs one or two yuan. Because I love to eat this dish, I have to make it myself every summer. Buy a small winter melon, peel it, and cut off a small half of the top. Use the larger half below. Dig out all the flesh, then add diced ham, diced meat, fragrant mushrooms, vermicelli, bamboo shoots, and a little salt and cooking wine. It would be even better if you add some chicken giblets and duck giblets. After all these steps are done, put a fresh lotus leaf on top (fresh lotus leaves are not easy to get in Shanghai, you can buy them from a pharmacy), and then steam it in water until the winter melon is tender. It tastes very delicious, with a slight fragrance of lotus leaf, and the clearness of the soup is needless to say. After eating the things in the bowl, you can dip the winter melon in soy sauce to eat. Because the umami has penetrated into the flesh, it is also more delicious than ordinary winter melon. Readers may wish to try it out. Eating it once or twice a week is not considered wasteful!</p>

<h3>How to Make Canned Food</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>The first requirement is to ensure that the can does not leak air at all. Ordinary cans are not very reliable. It is advisable to add solder and tin to the joints in all aspects before use. For cooked foods, a preservative can be added to 3% to 10% of the total amount, fully mixed with the food, and then loaded into tin cans. After sealing the lid, heat to above 100 degrees Celsius and below 105 degrees Celsius. After cooling, if the can lid does not bulge outward after two or three weeks, it is qualified. If it bulges, it means that there is not enough preservative. It is advisable to pack ten cans in a small test, increasing the percentage from 3% to 12%, adding marks to each, and then select one as the standard that does not change after the moldy season and the three伏天, so as not to suffer huge losses. Raw foods cannot be heated. A vacuum machine must be used to extract the air, but it costs at least five or six thousand gold. However, ice and salt can also kill the bacteria, that is, break the ice into pieces, add one-third of salt, mix it, put it in the refrigerator, and freeze it to below 0 degrees Celsius. It can also be stored for a long time, but it must still be tested separately with preservatives as described above. Also, when icing, there must be a can without a lid so that a thermometer can be inserted to observe the coldness. It must be below zero degrees for six hours before it can be taken out. In general, three parts of ice and one part of salt can cool to minus 21 degrees Celsius. If one part of ice and one part of salt are used, it can cool to minus 75 degrees Celsius, so its bactericidal power is very effective. If there is no ice, snow can be used to replace ice in winter; otherwise, chemical medicines must be used as a cold agent, which should be determined according to the local situation, taking cheapness as the criterion. For the preparation of preservatives, you can purchase boric acid powder and glycerin from Western pharmacies or raw material stores for self-production. First, heat three pounds of glycerin to 105 degrees Celsius, then slowly add two pounds of boric acid powder, stirring constantly, so that the water is completely evaporated, until it is transparent and has no sediment. Try taking a drop and blowing it cold. If it can be as brittle as glass, it is successful and qualified, and it can be directly dissolved into the liquid of the food. If there is no liquid in the food and it cannot be dissolved, dissolve it in water or alcohol first, and still calculate the amount of solids to be used.</p>
<p>(Note) Anyone who wants to manufacture and sell must first go through the above-mentioned small test. At least it must be able to remain unchanged after ten months before it can be recognized as a practical manufacture and sale. In general, the market for canned food is not after the season, but before the season. For example, before the beginning of summer, the 　fish has not yet come out of the water, but it has already been sold on the market first. Everyone thinks it is a new and newly seen thing, but they do not know that it is a cold-stored product from the previous year. Only by understanding this principle can you do it, otherwise, selling against the time will be a wrong plan. Therefore, this industry seems easy, but only those with patience and perseverance can make it a permanent business, because it will take three years to succeed. However, compared with planting trees for ten years, it can be said to be quick success. Nothing is difficult in the world, it only depends on whether you have the heart. If there is no perseverance, there will be no permanent business. In one year, there are more than a hundred things, and one out of a hundred tests will be successful, it only depends on whether you have the heart.</p>
<p>Attached calculation method for converting thermometers: I have a simple formula, which is extremely easy to remember. The first section has only three sentences: To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, first subtract 32, then multiply by 5 and divide by 9. (For example, 50 degrees Fahrenheit is 10 degrees Celsius.) The second section also has only three sentences: To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 9 and divide by 5, then add 32. (For example, 100 degrees Celsius is 212 degrees Fahrenheit.)

<h3>Does the Soul Exist? (Continuation 3)</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>(5) Man is the spirit of all things! All things do not have souls, only humans have souls, so humans can be the spirit of all things, the owner of all things. Raptors in the sky, wild beasts in the mountains, and whales in the sea, although stronger than humans, are all subdued by humans. Humans can also use water, fire, wind, and electricity to work for them. They can also study astronomy, geography, and understand chemistry, history, and mathematics. All of these can prove that humans have souls, otherwise, how could they be so intelligent?</p>
<p>(6) The Bible proves that humans have souls! In the beginning, when God created all things, he did not need to do anything to make the plants grow. Animals were created from soil. The human body was also created from soil, but after the body was created, God breathed his spirit into the human nostrils, so man became a living person with a soul. (See Genesis 1 and 2 in the Old Testament of the Bible.) This is another proof that humans have souls.</p>
<p>(7) What is the end of the soul? We are now at the end of talking about the end of the soul: all things have an end, and the soul must also have an end. The growth soul of man must stop and perish. For example, when people get old, their hair thins and falls out, and they can no longer grow. All parts of the body will only age and become thin. The sense soul also regresses in old age. The eyes are blurred, the ears are deaf, and the brain is dull. When the soul leaves the body, the growth soul and the intuitive soul are completely destroyed, because these two are attached to the body. When the body is broken, they lose their effectiveness, so the dead do not feel pain even if you hit or poke them. But at that time, the soul still exists as a whole, but after it leaves the body, it must have a home. If there is no home, it becomes a wandering soul without a home, then it will be captured by the evil spirits (devils) in the air, becoming its prisoner, being abused by it, and eventually perishing with it on the last day.</p>
<p>Dear reader, I hope you will quickly turn to the God you are trying to reach, and into the arms of Jesus who saves you! He will surely receive you! Save you! Love you to the end. (This article is finished, I will talk about heaven and hell when I have time in the future.) Shanghai Christian Literature Evangelistic Society PO Box 1227</p>
<h3>The Confused Rice Market</h3>
<p>— (Ting Kang)</p>
<p>Price-controlled rice is fine and broken, and the color is yellow and rough. There are only prices and no invoices for the superior white goods.</p>
<p>Despite the rent authorities issuing a prohibition on price controls, the black market in the rice market is still soaring step by step due to the manipulation of hoarders. High-quality white粳 has reached 30 yuan, and even 洋秈 costs more than 20 yuan. Therefore, people are terrified, and a dark shadow rises in their hearts, "Don't repeat the era of eating flour two years ago!" In fact, the degree of terror can be seen in front of the rice shops:</p>
<p>In a rice shop, rice buyers are crowded outside the counter, but they all buy only one斗八升, because if you want to buy one石五斗, they will mostly refuse you, saying that there is no stock. I saw an old woman, holding about ten yuan, trembling and begging: "Sir, I borrowed money from the east and west, please do a good deed and sell me five斗." However, the rice shop assistant showed a fierce face and shook his head like a rattle drum. The situation was simply worse than asking him for food. But I clearly heard a phone call a while later asking for five石. The person who was holding the pen to keep accounts said to the receiver: "The price is 30 yuan, no invoices will be issued, pay when the goods arrive, otherwise the original goods will be brought back." That's why I realized why five斗. is not willing to sell one stone of rough. rice, the grains are fine and broken, and the rice is yellow." In this way, why not report on the reports</p>
<p>Among the crowded buyers, some are asking citizens not to buy price-controlled rice at all, and only buy night rice. Do these things happen, why not report them? Of course, some people are willing to pay high prices to eat good white rice.</p>
<p>There is another shop, everyone is spreading the word that the price is fair, but each person is limited to buying at most five斗. Don't give it away, so the door looks particularly crowded, but most of the families in Xiaokang are prepared to accumulate some in case the price of rice rises again.</p>
<p>The rice market is chaotic, everyone is in a panic, and there is a lot of discussion in the streets and alleys, all saying that if this continues, foreign exchange will be as little as two offices, gold will rise to 6,000 yuan, and rice will cost at least 30 yuan. People's hearts are even more flustered, hoarders are desperately hoarding and hoarding, and wealthy families are also hoarding to avoid eating expensive goods, and the poor are still affected and suffer heavy losses. What will they do?</p>
<p>General life is getting harder day by day, and rice prices are about to skyrocket to this point. This is forcing people to go down the road of wrongdoing. The wise authorities should investigate the actual rice reserves as soon as possible, (in fact, we do have enough rice reserves, and the beginning of autumn has passed, and the new grain is about to come on stage.) and take effective measures to enforce the price limit, so that citizens can live in peace. On the one hand, let the friends who hoard rice and make war money touch their conscience.</p>
<h3>Hold a Second-Hand Goods Charity Sale to Help the Needy</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>At this time of soaring prices, it is difficult for people in the middle and lower classes to even make a living, let alone bear the living expenses of others. However, tens of thousands of refugees living in the "isolated island" are still waiting for our relief. Therefore, I suggest that it is best to hold a second-hand goods charity sale.</p>
<p>The scope of second-hand goods includes all daily necessities, such as clothes, furniture, books, stationery, shoes, boots, as well as washbasins, towels, and other parts. Donors set the price for sale, and the proceeds are donated to refugee shelters, and unsold goods are also donated for the daily use of refugees.</p>
<p>This method is very economical. Everyone's home often has many things that are not needed. Rather than selling them to second-hand dealers at low prices, why not donate them for charity? For example, clothes, now there is a competition to popularize clothing, noble ladies and ladies, each dress is only worn once or twice, and then placed at the bottom of the box, and after a long time, they become rewards for the aunts. Why not take them out for charity sales, so that people with lower economic conditions can prepare clothing at a lower price, and refugees can get real benefits. Why not do it? Also, children grow very fast, and the clothes added every year, if there are younger brothers and sisters to wear, or if there are younger brothers and sisters who don't want to wear old clothes and want to make new clothes, then isn't it good to take out the old clothes for charity sales? Also, the books used in schools are bought at high prices and sold for nothing, and they are often changed. Except for siblings of different ages in the same school who can use them, other textbooks are simply of no great use. Why not take them out to sell to younger students? I still go to buy books from older students, do charity, and get books at low prices. Why not?</p>
<p>After the public charity sale ends in a few days, those that are not sold, or are too old to be bought by people, will be given to refugee shelters and distributed to refugees for daily use, so there will be no costs at all.</p>
<p>There are many charitable people in this city who are enthusiastic about public welfare. I hope everyone will cooperate and elect enthusiastic, capable, upright, and honest people to be leaders. Everyone should do their duty and work hard to ensure that all those in difficulty can receive real benefits. Then this merit is truly great!</p>

<h3>A Grand View of Disaster Currency</h3>
<p>— Sent from Paris by Xin Jin</p>
<p>The Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Invitations held in Shanghai in June included other coins, cigarette cards, and other finished products; it was indeed a magnificent sight. I alone regret its omission of the disaster currency (Notgelder) from various European countries after the European War, which led to a shortage of copper coins in Shanghai shortly thereafter, causing a currency famine. The people of Shanghai were completely unprepared. I anticipate that after the government establishes regulations for substitutes for chips, such as stamps, domestic art, technology, and advertising experts will surely seize this opportunity to create academically and industrially outstanding achievements. Just look at Austria, where paper mills and printing workers flourished after the European War, and the colorfully printed substitute currency they engraved, which displayed historical colors and local spirit; how exquisite they were. Sixteen or seventeen years ago, Vienna, the capital of Austria, even held a War-Notes-Market exhibition. Those eager to win will find a way out when they reach their limit; there is profit to be made from nothing. Expired banknotes are transformed into secret treasures that connoisseurs rush to collect. Never missing an opportunity, everything is enough to make people smile through their tears. Germany, in particular, has gone even further in its textile industry center, Bielefeld, which is famous for its industrial dominance, issuing silk piece auxiliary currency that combines weaving and printing, adorning the celebration of the 700th anniversary of the city's establishment in 1921; and then the city of Meissen, the world's second Jingdezhen, casts porcelain coins, one side with a symbol of wasteland reclamation, the other side proudly displaying the city emblem, the porcelain as white as eggshells, lustrous and lovely. As for the city of linden trees, the center of the book industry, they used chestnut-colored thick cardboard, stapled and used as cover pages, to print paper circular auxiliary coins for use on trams (see attached picture), strong and not easily damaged, truly opening a new chapter in the history of currency systems for the world. Not only do people from all over the world gather to pursue them, their value is multiplied a hundredfold, enough to bring Germans unexpected sources of profit after enduring national disasters. As for the advertising method of using stamps as chips, there are French-style light small coins inlaid with stamps, with artificial mica as the face and thin iron sheets as the backing, varying in size and shape, with the city emblem or trademark pressed on the back of the coin, exquisite and delicate, worthy of emulation.</p>
<h3>Tears of a Dancer</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>“Panama Lady”</p>
<p>"Tears of a Dancer" is about the conflict between the sexuality and reason of a dancer, Lucy. The scripting technique is quite dramatic.</p>
<p>The entire film is set in Panama, South America: the various characters in small bars, the postures of low-class dancers, and the clear sound of snakes, matched with Lucy's melancholy and low tone, the director's rendering of the tropical scenery is very exquisite and moving.</p>
<p>However, the tone of the entire film is too steady and slow. For example, when Metag brings Lucy back, and the female Zima secretly places poison in the fish, intending to poison Lucy, and when Locke chases after her by plane and meets Lucy, the former is not tense enough (the placement of the poison in the second act is also not clearly depicted); in the latter, Lucy should rush out quickly after hearing the sound of the plane, waving her hands to welcome him by the lake in such a bland manner is not enough to express the passion accumulated in her heart. Similarly, when Locke (the pilot) steals the kerosene registration book, Lucy's inner conflict is not clearly expressed, so warning Locke with a gun seems a bit sudden. The most important key is that after Lucy and Metag live in the same house, the contradictory psychology of secretly loving him while still yearning for Locke is not strongly depicted. The beautiful mood written by the director is only superficial, and does not go deep into the inner layer of Lucy's heart.</p>
<p>Finally, the ending of Lucy and Metag riding in the same car is very clever.</p>
<p>Lucille Ball's Lucy is just melancholy and lacks passion. Her inner contradictions have not been resolved well enough. Alan Ladd's Metag is just steady.</p>
