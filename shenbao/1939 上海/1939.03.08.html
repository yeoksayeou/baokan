<h3>敬吿婦女界</h3>
<p>今日婦女節。　在非常時期，人人事事，時時處處，皆應該急所尤急。誰復有閒情逸致，像往年，像平時，逢到佳時令節，鋪張點綴？原來婦女節不僅是閒情逸致的點綴，自有她深長的意義；但在抗戰之中，「軍事第一，勝利第一，意志集中，力量集中，」相形之下，不妨將婦女節撇開了不提。但是我們，尤希望中國的婦女們，却為了抗戰，以非常的情緒，來度今年非常的婦女節。、</p>
<p>中國的婦女，遭遇非常；不但對世界的婦女，對中國的男子，毫不慚愧，已經有非常的貢獻了。以一般的活動而論：獻金，購債，敎育難童，救護創傷，救濟後方同胞，慰勞前綫將士；乃至其他種種最適宜於女子的工作，無不慷慨奮發，已有卓著的事功。此外，在國內，有成羣的女中英豪，耐勞苦，忍饑寒，不避鋒鏑，馳驅萬里，直接在戰區服務；有好幾省，舉辦女壯丁軍事訓練，受訓的不知凡幾，鍛鍊好身手，準備殺敵致果。在國外，吶喊街頭，奔波宣傳，博得國際的同情；尤其在美國沿太平洋各港，不但參加了各種反侵略運動，且以華僑婦女為中心，，組織了糾察隊，對於製造殺人凶器的原料，如廢鋼生鐵，運往日本作有效的阻止，有幾處因此而根本禁運了。種種勞績、種種成就，幾乎開闢了世界婦女非常工作的新局面。造成了世界婦女報國救國的新紀元！更値得注意的，一切勞績，一切成就，决非三五個知名而傑出的女英豪所得而為功；也就是，無從歸功於三五個知名而傑出的女英豪身上：換一句話說，多數婦女參預了，活躍了，功勞顯著了。這是中國婦女界的無上光榮！</p>
<p>今日婦女節，我們旣稱讚了多數中國婦女們，參預非常工作，造就偉大勳功；她們眞是努力於建設天堂。同時，我們極傷心地紀念着其他多數中國婦女們，備受了恥辱蹂躪，而作慘痛犧牲；她們眞是不幸而淪陷於活地獄，不但如此，我們更知道尙有更大多數的中國婦女們，雖身臨非常時期，却置身於抗戰救國之外；她們或奄奄一息於蒙昧的宇宙，或醉生夢死於另一黑暗世界！</p>
<p>對於這些更大多數的中國婦女，我們暫時不應菲薄她們，而應喚起她們。至少要使她們感覺抗戰的必要，不抗戰則非但得不到婢妾生活，並且要打入活地獄，使她們自覺婦女非但是人，並且是民；民對於國，不分男女，同樣負有不容諉卸的責任，故須培養自己負起國民責任的本能，使她們理解，婦女不但與男子同是國民，且是國民之母，故有敎養子女，使子女不媿為下一代的國民，而能負起下一代的責任。使她們體認現代的社會，以家庭為組織的最小單位。而婦女是每一單位中間的主要細胞；主要細胞須有健全的意識與能力，然後可以形成健全的社會。她們必然知道婦女意識與能力的健全與否。直接表現於她所主持的一個家庭，使家庭的健全與否直接受其支配；但她們必須更進一步的知道，抗戰救國的精神與物質，旣以國族範圍內的整個社會為源泉，則此項精神物質的是否充盈，即繫於社會單位的家庭，即繫於家庭主要細胞的主婦。</p>
<p>如此說法，决非過甚其辭。例如抗戰時期，必須推行兵役與工役；如何推行，雖關國家的法令，然主婦對於兵役工役的意態，必直接影響及於其丈夫與兒子；我們雖不謂此種影響乃比較國家法令為更有權威，然至少不能否認其影響及於法令推行之順利與否。又例如抗戰時期，國家必不免於勸捐募債及其他徵發；除了一部分得以國家法令强制辦理之外，，其他一部分或大部分，必須民間踴躍輸將；　踴躍與否，一視婦女的意態，一視婦女操持家政所餘的物力如何。又例如抗戰時期，倡導緊縮節儉，勸禁奢侈浪費、這是培養保持國族力量的重要因素；但其關鍵所在，與其謂在於一般社會的注意，母寗切切實實謂在於每一家庭中主婦的力行。</p>
<p>我們深信奄奄一息於蒙昧的宇宙間的，與醉生夢死於另一黑暗世界中的女子决非不願愛國，决非不欲救國；她們大抵以為自已太渺小，以為自己與國家的關係太疎遠；不是菲薄自已而是不知自已。如何普遍地喚醒她們？這在賢明的婦女界應該多負一些責任啊！</p>

<p>瑪德裏終結西班牙內戰、今夜愈見迫切、因大部政府軍艦隊之擊退、及外間謠傳瑪德里國防委員會、已與在弗朗哥領導下之叛軍政府作和平談判、故衆認西班牙此次內戰、實有吿一段落之可能、此間法人方面最流行之報告、均謂國防委員會國防部長加薩陀將軍、已向在蒲爾哥斯之弗朗哥將軍提出和平建議、聞此一建議、乃根據於自由獨立及和解之基礎、據云、政府軍方面亦希望叛軍領袖在其答覆中、能提起一榮譽的和平之議、尤以允許「使西班牙從外國及同盟方面獲得自由」為最、（六日美聯電）</p>

<p>浙東旅行通訊（五）</p>
<h3>水運交通重心　商業總匯之蘭谿　全縣受訓壯丁已過半數花舫女子踴躍參加訓練</h3>
<p>由金華至蘭谿，浙贛鐵路有金蘭支綫，僅一小時左右可達。蘭谿過去屬金華府，民國後才廢府為縣治，到民國二十二年之秋，浙省府定為實騐縣，經幾年來的努力辦理，蘭谿全縣的各鄕鎭均有着良好的組織與秩序。蘭谿是一個有着數十萬人口的大都市，除縣市外，游埠，諸葛，永昌，女埠等地，都是很熱鬧的重鎭，且各鎭與縣市，均有公路汽車相互接連，亦為浙東的一個重要地方。</p>
<p>設酒精廠</p>
<p>蘭谿是婺·衢·甬三港的中貫，縣城即位於三港合聚之地。故浙省的商業，在沿海一帶以寗波為中心，內地以杭州為中心，而浙東運河流域的貨運，則以蘭谿為總匯。故今日的蘭谿由於戰時環境的造成，不僅為各地水運交通的重地，且為今日浙東商業的集合地，更形繁榮起來。蘭谿本縣的農產每年有二百六十餘萬担，特產以甘蔗為主，年產十六萬左右。手工業特甚，有造紙，榨油，烟絲，糖，火腿及牲畜等。工業方面，亦有工廠數家，最近金華及蘭谿二地人士主辦酒精廠一所，聞出品之質量，成績故佳，這件新興的戰事工業，亦足為吾人所應重視者。</p>
<p>婦女動員</p>
<p>當地人民的熱烈情緒，也並不後於其他各地，在社會方面，縣黨部民敎館在各鎮都有救國團體的組織，鼓勵各鎭居民踴躍捐款救國。記者至民敎館詢問，據說：他們自滬戰爆發以後，便積極的組織地方民衆，開始在市區，對各戶居民指導防空防毒及救護的方法。現在，他們仍在進行組織民衆的計劃，希冀每一個蘭谿的人民，都能有充份的戰時智識，及救國的思想。同時，婦女方面亦頗有組織，除了婦女救護班外，他們亦計劃訓練蘭谿的花舫女，因為在蘭谿江畔，有許多的花舫，據縣政府最近的調查，城區有花舫二十一艘，舫女九十人，年齡大都在十八歲至二十一歲間，然在這九十個舫女中，能識字的僅九人，其中略具刺繡技能者八人，其餘都屬不識字而毫無技能者，而且這些舫女，平時大都空閒，所以計劃積極的訓練她們，使她們亦能為國家服務。其次蘭谿在城內西北城弄一帶，（包括上溪下街驛前北津街下長街等處）。有茶室八十九家，她們都雇用茶女招待茶客，共計茶女有一百三十二人，這許多的茶女，年齡在十七至十九之間最多，故亦授以救護的智識，使為國服務。同時大部的舫女及茶女，她們亦都很願意受此訓練，這種精神，委實値得敬愛的。</p>
<p>參觀永昌</p>
<p>蘭谿有夜市，在西大街等處都很熱鬧，有幾家新開的洋廣鋪子，市招都用霓虹燈，街上雖在晚上，來往的人仍很熙攘。記者經城樓時，上設有一民衆圖書館，便上去參觀，閱讀的人很多，所集各地的報紙極多，在書架上，有幾册新出版的雜誌，在蘭谿當地亦有報紙出版，同金華的金聲日報內容格式都差不多。蘭谿全縣統計有五二二三五人，在全縣九十三鄕鎭中，都分區的編組訓練，「永昌為蘭谿的一個重鎭，記者乃渡江乘公路汽車去參觀一次，車行六十分鐘左右即達，下車為一條蜿曲　鄕道，再進則為一熱鬧的橫街，市容頗整，兩旁全是很大的店鋪，在街上找得了鎭公所，便進去訪問，據當地的鎭長所述：「本鎭抽訓壯丁的規則很嚴，不分富戶農戶，凡在壯丁年齡的都得派往受訓，不能出錢代雇或故意推託，國家在道種時期，吾們幹事絕對不應當隨便，否則，便對不起國家了。本鎭受訓練的壯丁已佔大數，至於鎭上人民的救國思想都很高，所以都很願出錢捐募公債」，在內地的一個鄕鎭中，能有這樣的精神，也足以使人起敬了。</p>
<p>此行印象</p>
<p>綜上這一個簡單的輪廓中，很足以顯示出今日的浙東，雖在軍事的後方，而他整個的組織，依然包持着很健全的機構，各地的經濟，政治，民衆組織，都在前進的途程中。吾們知道，要獲得最後的勝利，有了鞏固的戰綫，同時亦需要穩健的後方，今日中國後方各地社會組織的健全，民衆情緒的激烈，這便是獲得最後勝利的一個明顯的象徵。（完）</p>

<h3>金融北帮出龍　現金價銳降不已</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖多變幻、但已不若上數日之劇烈、惟價則承前日之疲風、且聞天津金價亦萎靡不振、故北帮力託證券帮與某掮客傾向出籠，且尙有一般散戶多頭胆怯者亦爭前了結、致不支下瀉、幾達常日之最低價收盤、唯中途曾因某錢兌業暨銀樓帮互相購買、一度稍昂、卒以求不敵供、終難久持、結果又猛跌廿六元、各方人心疲軟、交易尙旺、銀樓飾金亦隨跌二元、關令暨中英純金等均略下降、</p>
<p>烚赤再跌念六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開賣方喊二千一百五十八九元、但進者均懷觀望態度、未幾證券帮與某掮客亦來爭前拋塞、故價破入五十元關內、首由證劵帮售予錢兌業九十兩、價二千一百四十五元為開盤價、較前收做低十七元、開後北帮賣意更濃、致價續向下挫、某掮客賣予銀樓帮九十兩、價四十元、繼之證券帮相同價亦售予錢兌業五十兩、此後證券帮雖續來吐售、但以某錢兌業暨銀樓帮吸購愈殷、故價遂止跌轉漲、某錢兌業進證券帮五十兩、為四十一元、又進證券帮五十兩、價四十三元、某錢兌業吸進後、未幾即復吐予銀樓帮五十兩、後銀樓帮進某掮客五十兩、為四十二元、金號進某錢兌業五十兩、價四十七元、某錢兌業供給後卽轉手復進同業五十兩、價四十八元、相同價銀樓帮亦進某掮客五十兩、其時賣者更缺銀樓帮進錢兌業五十兩、一躍而為五十二元、此後因北帮賣意轉濃、復向下挫、某掮客售予銀樓帮五十兩、價四十九元五角、繼之證券帮售予銀樓帮五十兩、為四十九元、時已午時、午後因北帮續來猛塞、一般胆怯散戶多頭亦來了結、加以進者奇缺、初開即破入四十元關內二時四十分首見錢兌業售予同業五十兩、價卅七元、繼之相同價北帮亦售予同業五十兩、後北帮又售予金號百兩、卅五元為最低價、最後錢兌業互做五十兩、二千一百卅六元為晚收價、較之前收軋跌廿六元、（已運跌二天、共計五十四元）全天十八元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百四十五元、收進二千一百卅元、現標金照掛脾金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>首飾金連小二次</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初均未更、迨至九時三刻、因烚赤初開即做低十餘元、故亦掛小一元、後又至下午二時五十分、因烚赤又破入四十元關內、故再掛小一元、大同行老慶雲等改縣二百十七元、新同行二百十五元、收進二百〇九元、</p>
<p>英純金縮半便士</p>
<p>六日倫敦電、英純金每盎司縮半便士、計退達七鎊八先令三辦士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦降低至一千二百十元〇六角、掛牌海關金亦低二厘、計二元三角九分二厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌三角、計一千二百〇五元九角、</p>
<h3>外滙轉穩　港匯則稍鬆動</h3>
<p>匯市昨以油洋行德士古暨其他各大洋行雖來扒結、但因外電香港亦會來拋塞、是以過程頗形平穩、唯外商銀行如匯豐等則大致進賤出貴、結果英美兩匯、俱無軒輊、交易不旺、港匯因外電與華行等頻塞、且洋行吸購不力、致局勢略見鬆動、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長〇六二五、遠期轉平、紐約銀價亦未更動、倫敦生金縮半辦士、滙兌英對美大一厘二、對法·對滬均無升降、美對英長三一二五、對法升一二五、對滬漲七分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行晨開賣價、滙八辦士一四〇六二五、美匯十五元九〇六二五、較前收、美兩滙均平、開後外電香港首來拋塞、售予滙豐·麥加利•華比·某行英金八辦士一四〇六二五、兼美滙十五元九〇二五、是以為狀頗平、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大二厘半、計徵百分之八•〇〇、此後雖各大洋行稍有結款、但以外行吸進港電後、故供意尙濃、致鮮變化，洋行結進滙豐英金八辨士一二五、繼之又扒結某行美滙十五兀八七五、近午外行華義等相繼拋售港滙、致潛勢略帶鬆、薊義華行賣予洋行港匯五十四元三七五及半元、午收銀行互做價、英金八辨士一四〇六二五、美滙十五元九〇六二五、</p>
<p>後市沉寂而呆、僅有油洋行德士古暨其他各大洋行等梢來扒結、但以外銀行尙肯供售、故局勢仍穩、洋行結進滙豐英金八辦士一二五、繼之德士古亦扒結某行美滙十五元八七五、最後洋行又吸進華義港匯五十四元半、為狀乏變、晚收銀行互做價英金八辦士一四〇六二五、美匯十五元九〇六二五、與晨開無異、結果較之前收、英美兩匯、均無榮辱、而港匯則見鬆一二五、</p>
<h3>大條近長遠平</h3>
<p>六日倫敦電、投機家買進、市面極其平穩、收盤後、近期平而、滯呆、遠期則有人少數買進、大條銀近期長〇六二五、遠期勿動、紐約銀電、美銀價依然呆定如故、又孟買銀電、印銀沉寂、現貨與近遠期仍未更動、</p>
<h3>匯劃貼現　回小三元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、突然回低、乃趁高供給驟多也、每千元已回入五十元大關內、晨初仍計五十一元左右、繼即步跌三元至四十八元、午刻四十九元、下午續低、一度曾退至四十七元半、最後四十八元、比前日回低三元、</p>
<h3>外幣獲利回出　英美金鎊下降銳利</h3>
<p>昨日英純金跌半辦士、英美滙兌升一二五、外滙結款甚殷、勢呈軟弱、後港電供給頻仍、銀行賣意活動、市價轉呈堅穩、烚赤人心恍惚、津帮拋賣甚勁、雖殷富趁低價吸納、終以碼籌鬆動、勢呈不振、收盤軟弱、外幣英美金鎊、殷富出籠甚旺、下降猛烈、其他各幣、需要未殷、且匯票趨鬆、多呈微降、僅德金票澳金票需要稍增軋升、門市交易平庸、公會交易已稀、僅勤泰出惠通進美金票一百元、鎭興出福和祥進法郎票二千五百個、昨日市價、英金鎊降六角、英金票降五分、美金鎊降五角、香港票降一厘、新加坡票降二分、荷蘭票降三分、義金票降一分、德金票升一角四分、澳金票升三角、其他各幣、俱無更動、</p>
<h3>紗花　春銷發動　細紗橫跳八元　二十支獨以存貨擁擠而呆定</h3>
<p>紗市依然不脫徘徊之象、蓋以實需平淡、致人心安靜、惟三二支·四二支細紗情勢益趨緊俏、實緣春銷發展、贛帮搜羅殷切、加之市上現貨籌碼殊感缺乏、且廠方生產錠子甚少、故生意稍起、市價即復上升、至於二十支因存貨較厚、且廠方出數增加、而南方需要不若從前之發達、市氣鬆懈、故廿支雙馬紗價一經在四百元關口屢進屢出、為時甚久、但大衆心理以原料到貨枯弱、價格日昂、廠方成本加高、預料將後廠方不肯賤價開出、因此交易雖滯、執貨者技持不動、市態尷尬、旣不能跌、又不能漲也、但三二支、四二支細紗氣勢愈趨愈緊、實際交易、應時令而起、需要較增、然其中做作益力、故漲風積極前進、比上日要昂騰六元至八元之譜、午後廿支紗被其帶好一步云、査江西·寗波·湖甫三帮買去將近一百包、同行成交有二百包左右云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、依然一片渙散氣象、因各方採辦甚鮮、惟江西帮對於細紗仍來探詢、一般執貨者鑒於環境好轉無意脫卸、市價尤挺、三二支雙地球紗始做五百〇六元、須臾卽跳四元、為五百十元、但二十支雙馬紗價仍開四百元、與上日無甚軒輊、此後依然無甚變化、午後開盤以細紗市價步步上陞、二十支紗亦被帶挺、漲五角、二十支雙馬紗價為四百元〇〇五角、結果成交一千三百九十包、仍以同行佔多數、行情二十支雙馬漲五角、特金城漲一元、其餘平穩、惟細紗大跳六元至八元、廠方未有舉動、今日　口棉紗有一百六十五件運天津、二百五十五件運汕頭、茲將各帮買去之額量錄左、</p>
<p>日紗售價依然呆木、蓋以北銷去路又滯、故市情尤挫、二十支水月現紗價為三百三十五元、二十支籃鳳現紗價為三百二十九元、與上日無甚進出云、</p>
<h3>本棉銷路　日漸繁旺</h3>
<p>本棉生意益形發展、申新廠購盯美印棉為額殊巨、對於本棉亦開始採辦應用、因此市價繼續前進、一般執貨者、鑒於來源旣缺、而存貨日枯、居奇之念尤切、市價因之步挺、同業買賣以天津細絨占多數、火機花仍做七十元、現鈔價、茲瓊棉業中人云、各路產區之貨、仍雍積無法運出、貨爛於地、如果設法抵滬、獲利之厚、莫可言喩也、故販運者未絕、不過額量微細、然利息頗厚、碼頭到貨下沙花一百十九包、姚花一萬包、惟據另一報告則謂姚花由寗波運來者僅三千四百七十件、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>英布廣銷推動美棉　傳美貸棉將放出五十萬又傳申新進印棉六千件</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約及蘭開夏布疋銷數日廣、市上可供買賣之棉日缺、所剩餘者均屬次下級、而美政府之貸款棉出售問題迄今尙未解决、原棉需要日增、新花未登塲前、却需大批貸款棉放出、俾使流通、以敷應用、雖經蘭開夏推派代表、前去美農部秘書亨利威爾商懇、先行放出貸款棉若干、美議員亦建議政府、將施密斯之提案、略加修正、設法提前放出貸款棉五十萬包之說、紐約棉市挺秀異常、昨日又漲七八磅音、印度因甘地絕食、交易所停止買賣、但某大棉行接到電報、預測四五月份白洛區為一五六羅比、較之上週交易所行市高出四羅比餘、埃及漲十餘磅音、昨日滙兌較鬆、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西棉每担漲四角、印棉漲二角、埃及漲七角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因海外棉市飛漲、折合法幣、殊不合算、故交易異常淸淡、但市上盛傳申新又購進印棉六千件、但未能證實、値此印棉飛漲聲中、申新恐不致訂購外棉也、况廠方存底甚豐、不致高價進購也、新裕購意頗濃、唯因價格相差過巨、雖已去電孟買、恐難成交也、日廠方面成交印棉三千包、計上海廠一千五百包、裕豐五百包、大康豐田各五百包、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價、分列於後、</p>
<h3>上週棉紗　成交萬五千餘包　粗紗占百分之八十浙東交易猶覺呆滯</h3>
<p>二月二十七日至三月五日止、一週以來之紗市、因春銷起色、市塲遂呈活潑氣象、華南滇帮華北天津兩帮發動採辦、相繼而來、人心因之向榮、市况重振、但査其買去之貨、十支粗紗占百分之八十强、而細紗需要仍平、故粗紗售價頓趨緊俏、同時廠方開出紛繁、以應各方需求、結果二十支雙馬紗價比前週價漲四元半、</p>
<p>廠方開出十支粗紗『六一〇包又　又二十支細紗』一五〇包浙東方面、對於布疋裝運漸旺、惟棉紗交易尙滯、閩南一帶日艦齏集、商賈惶慮、紗銷週末又見减色、前途狀况、非遇幾批交易發展、殊難上漲、目前不脫徘徊之境耳、</p>
<p>雲南帮　三、〇八〇包</p>
<p>天津帮　二、七五五包</p>
<p>團戶　七、一八五包</p>
<p>其他　二、三五包</p>

<h3>疋頭　細紗織物需要增廣　府綢各廠開價步昻</h3>
<p>國布以細紗綫原料、現貨缺乏、而各織廠因節令轉移、細紗綫織物本外埠需要擴展、故走銷暢達、供不應求、各廠紗綫條素府綢開價步增、現市較上月底售價每疋續漲三角之譜、呌盤尤昂、洋紗蔴紗上身漂布售盤亦一致提高、川帮需要不斷、續辦漂布·蔴紗·花素府綢·花布·花斜·色布二千餘疋、粵帮辦府綢·色布·細布·細斜二百餘件·溫甬帮辦漂布·漂斜·府綢·洋紗·色布一百數十箱、白貨細布·斜紋•組布七八十包、售盤平平、本街漂染廠對於細紗綫坯布、需求頗殷、門市生意因天氣陰寒、仍形淸淡、蘇北軍事形勢緊張、該區大批生意、暫陷停頓、內地批發交易亦稀少、</p>
<p>東疋白貨市盤轉堅、緣津帮前日拋售、昨又搜辦、烟靑客戶、亦各有吸納、北路共進各牌細布·細斜約五百件、本街批發需要　淡、而染廠帮實銷漸增、故昨日細布成交達八百餘件、細斜約二百餘件、售盤每疋回升九分至一角半、</p>
<p>今日疋頭出口、八百件運天津、二百件運烟台、六十四件運威海衛、三百十五件運汕頭、四十件運香港、昨有棉織品五百七十五件、天津來、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日當局取締投機　橫濱絲期現猛跌　本市絲價亦暗小三十元</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、橫濱突轉狂跌、現貨晨開一千零二十元、下午一千元、較前日猛跌五十五元、遠期九七八元、下午九五九元、較前日猛跌四十元、諒以日方當局取締投機所致、紐約里昂昨微有上落、今日當必隨之下降、本來此次絲市漲風、本刊曾一再指出其危機、齊絲業之主客觀、環境雖有利於囤積居奇、但投機者或實業者終無法不依「資本—商品—」之循環路綫、故市價上漲、固可刺激實銷、但千萬不能和實銷分道揚鑣、否則縱不為主管當局取締投機、但在市塲秩序紛亂之餘、商品出籠之時、出人意外之跌風、終必會跟隨瘋狂漲風之後、出現市塲也、</p>
<p>昨本埠絲市、亦隨之疲弱、白廠經內外均無做開、絲價暗中已下跌三十元、印莊亦無成交、諒本埠絲市、亦將由觀望而雞下游云、</p>
<h3>油餅　日人操縱下之油豆</h3>
<p>黃豆市况、分兩路說、一、大連速豆、晨初在大連市看好之下、尙見挺硬、入後、多頭乘大連報升之機會、紛謀出籠、致市氣為之削挫、結果、四月份大連豆跌去二角、做開十車左右、並做出五月份交三車、價為八元五角、其他沙黃杜豆、因時令關係、來源勢少、故人心尙穩固、且行情續砌、計成交崇明沙黃一百五十餘包、價為八元四角至八元三角、浦東杜豆二十包、價為十元、平湖杜豆七十包、價為十三元零二角、</p>
<p>七日自天津來黃豆五百二十六包、八日有黃豆一千四百八十包運往香港、五百包運烟台</p>
<p>花生油市况、因傳靑島有通融辦法之說、致一般消息靈通者、先聲奪人當即甩出膠州油一百件、價為二十六元、比上日市跌五角、入後浮囤獲利亟出一百五十件、價為二十五元五角、再跌五角、惟夾倉油在晨初開出、故市獨見呆立，但為勢亦危、烟台聽裝油先開三十四元、後跌至三十三元五角、結果、比上日市亦跌五角、昨有生油五百聽運往香港、</p>
<p>豆油市况、在有組織之操縱下、開始下挫、市氣一度曾混亂、行情頻跌、至收盤時市氣稍明朗、結果共削四五角、計開現大連油二百五十桶、三月上七十五桶、三月下八九百桶、四月上百餘桶四月五十桶</p>
<h3>糧食　米價愈漲</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下仍祇三號、車運包子無到、因火車停運所致、於是人心更昂、漲風愈熾、棧貨乘機推出、囤戶相當吸收、各貨已呈混沌之象、大市及高貨均開十四元、中段貨亦已十三元外、羊尖情形亦同、杜埠尖漲三四角、變元再騰半元有奇、總之此種現象、殊大有關於民食前途也、</p>

<h3>今日婦女界　紀念三八婦女節　對蔣夫人表示崇敬　市黨部以三事朂勉</h3>
<p>今日爲「三八」婦女節、本市婦女界、深切認明婦女解放與民族解放、不可分離、當此神聖抗戰、繼續推進、最後勝利、期不在遠、更表示無限熱烈興奮、婦女界今日雖不舉行盛大祝典、但各婦女團體、各女子中小學校、仍分別舉行紀念式、及聚餐會等、互相惕勵、盡婦女在非常時期應盡之責任、各婦女團體、對蔣夫人朱美齡女士、領導全國婦女界、參加抗戰救難、表示深切崇敬、上海婦女界難民救濟會、以難胞爲國被災、生活痛苦、特推定代表、自今日起、分赴各收容所慰問、</p>
<p>上海市黨部爲三八節告全市婦女同胞書云、偉大的三八節、又在抗戰轉入後期民族革命運動更趨有利的階段中降臨了、追懷過去我國抗戰的光榮史蹟、瞻念當前的艱鉅任務、與夫戰區婦女的慘遭蹂躪、輾轉流徙、哀苦無告、上海的女同胞、將如何興奮悲憤警惕、踏着先烈的血跡、爲民族謀眞正的解放、爲國家爭永久的生存、二十月來的堅强抗戰、旣已奠定了最後勝利的基礎、全國女同胞、在這抗戰的高潮中、也已普遍覺醒、無論在淪陷區、在後方、在戰地、都有廣大的婦女羣衆、獻身國家、在前綫做慰勞·救護·以及軍民合作等工作、在後方做着民衆宜傳·組織·訓練·慰勞戰士家屬•以及參加生產等工作、就是困居在孤島上的女同胞、也不甘落後地盡了相當的獻金救難等責任、現在抗戰建國、雖已轉入新的時期、最後勝利、雖已愈迫愈近、然而工作却也步入更艱鉅更緊要的階段、國家所期望於我全國國民的、也愈股切，唯有更進一步地集中全國人力·物力·財力·纔能把握住克敵制勝的有利條件、而完成民族革命的最後使命、也唯有這樣、三民主義的新中國、纔能早觀厥成、於此我上海的女同胞、實有更加緊努力加强奮鬥的必要、</p>
<p>第一，策劃國民精神總動員，我國的抗戰、在物質上固敵優於我、而在精神上、則敵遜我遠甚、且自今以後、敵我在物質上差異、將因敵之財政經濟困窘與我之不斷推陳出新而愈接近、敵我在精神上之差異、則將因敵軍民反戰情緒的高漲、與我抗戰意志更堅定而愈增高、此一精神上之優勢、即爲我可獲得最後勝利的有力的保證、我最高領袖蔣委員長爲充分策勵此有利條件、手訂國民精神總動員綱領及實施辦法、期在我全國人民抗戰必勝、建國必成的統一有力的信念下、更能集中人力·物力·財力·以粉碎敵人麻醉腐化我民族精神的陰謀鬼計、並擊破已陷入困境的頑敵軍力、而完成抗戰建國的偉大任務、我女同胞在家庭·在社會·精神上所能感召於人者、實居舉足輕重之地位、尤望我上海女同胞、努力整飭、由自身而家庭而社會、務期肅淸一切猶豫動搖的思想、建立正確革命的意志、使漢奸傀儡、翻然悔悟、至少不能立足於家庭社會、正本淸源、女同胞實負有重大使命、</p>
<p>第二，澈底實行抵制敵貨的工作，暴敵自「七七」發動侵略戰爭以還戰費所耗、已將百億、而其所獲、除侵佔了若干的點和綫以外、祗是國際關係的空前惡化、侵略軍事的陷於攻守失據、進退維谷的窘境、尤其在財政經濟上、有行將總崩潰的危險、最後的掙扎、便是在我國國境內掠奪資源、搜括財物、並實施大量傾銷、所謂經濟提携、經濟合作、其目的祗在以日本爲主幹、以完成其獨佔並壟斷我國的經濟命脈、我全國人民如能認淸敵的奸謀所在、澈底排除敵貨、則暴敵在經濟上財政上將更加速其破產，因此我女界同胞、必須深明利害、絕對拒絕購用敵貨、如能澈底做到、其裨益於抗戰前途、實不亞於前綫殺敵的戰士、</p>
<p>第三、擴大節約獻金運動，節約獻金運動，在上海過去已有相當成效、然苟細加檢討、第一、工作還不够普遍深入、尤其還不能打入富裕優越的階層、第二、還未能做到眞正由節約而獻金仍類普通捐款、當此抗戰建國已臨緊要關頭、唯賴全國人民刻苦緊縮、以增加生產資本、踴躍獻金、以提高抗戰國力、纔能保障最後勝利之獲得、我上海市民浸沉於淫靡奢侈的氣氛中、積重難返者、仍舉目皆是、深望我上海女同胞相互督勵、造成社會儉約風氣的中心，尤借我上海女同胞如能率先自勵、節約運動將可收效過半、，進而以節約所得、貢獻政府、則其造福國家、更何待言、最近渝地女界獻金、數達七十萬元、我上海女同胞如能踴躍輸將、必仍不止此數、要在能普遍切實推行吧了」、以上三事、僅舉其犖犖大者、我女界同胞、當本過去的革命精神、爲抗戰建國盡更大的貢獻、作更勇猛的奮鬥、須知我國抗戰最後勝利獲得之時、亦即我全國婦女同胞澈底解放之日、最後、敬祝全市婦女同胞、努力成功、</p>

<p>射陽河口　昨晨八時許、有日艦一艘、突向岸上發砲轟擊十餘發、同時並有日機三架、出現天空、該地軍事當局、早已嚴密防範、射陽河口、亦已實施封鎖、日方此舉、似在探視防軍力量、阜寗一帶華軍雲集、準備抵抗、</p>

<h3>華正規軍　已開入京滬綫　上官雲相擔任司令　日軍恐慌佈置工事　常熟偽警全部受撫</h3>
<p>中央對於京滬錢之游擊隊、業已準備就緒、精銳正規軍三師、已於本月初、從　地調來、並由上官雲相主持、不久將發生大規模之總反攻、日軍方面、異常恐慌、連日在京滬綫佈置防禦工事、茲經現代社記者、探誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>正規軍已調京滬綫</p>
<p>關於各游擊區之軍事上之計劃、業經中央統盤籌劃、並成立游擊總局、蔣委員長兼任總局長、並指定蘇·浙·皖·湘·鄂·贛·粵·魯·等各省、分爲若干區、每區設立分局、其軍政大員、業已委定、各區積極進行、探悉、關於京滬綫方面、由中央調遣精銳正規軍三師、約四萬餘人、已於本月初、照預定計劃、抵達京滬錢各處佈置、所有原有散集各區、從事襲擊日軍之游擊隊、均經正規軍重行改編、作爲後備隊、留守地方警戒、不得擾害民衆、餉需均由中央發給、</p>
<p>日軍恐慌佈置工事　自戰區面積擴大後、後方日軍、已大部開拔前綫作戰、所留駐在京滬鐵路綫之護路日軍、人數僅約一師團、且該項日軍中、尙有不少新由國內徵募來華之壯丁、實力殊爲單薄、連日日方在京滬綫一帶、佈置工事、日夜不輟、因近來各地日軍、反戰空氣濃厚、所收編之僞軍、亦時有反正、故日軍事當局、惴惴不安、情形萬分緊張恐慌、</p>
<p>大規模遊擊戰發動　擔任京滬綫游擊戰之司令、業經中央委派上官雲相主持、現悉該氏已抵達　　地、與江蘇區之游擊分局畏　　　、分赴京滬綫一帶視察、並進行準備總反攻之各項配備、預備最短期內、京滬錢上、大規模游擊戰即將發動、至於各縣歸附日方收編之僞軍警保安隊等、業經中央給予名義、於總反動時、乘機策應、</p>
<p>曹長金部衛入常熟　遊擊隊曹長金大隊長、六日晚、由唐市鎭率部衝入常熟西門、將僞江浙第四區綏靖司令部包圍、迫令繳械、僞司令徐鳳藻聞務、狼狽逃竄、餘部棄械投降、曹部此役、兵不血刃、計繳獲步槍二百六十支、盒子槍五十七支、輕重機關槍十二挺、招撫僞警二百八十名、號角齊鳴、整隊退出該城、仍潛回四郊、待機出擊、</p>
<p>閘北日軍添建堡壘　滬市　日軍、因恐華軍游擊隊之進襲、曾分別在南市·閘北·浦東·虹口·滬西·各地、增加駐軍、設置防禦工事、復將南市·閘北·空屋封閉、以防游擊隊潛跡、昨日日僞方面、又在浦東·滬西·進行封閉空屋工作、同時並在八字橋·廟行·中山路橋·等各區、添建堡壘、駐兵防守、一方面日軍三五成羣、分頭巡弋、恐懼情形、爲前所未見、</p>
<p>滬西日軍　據往來遊擊區之鄉民云、最近北新涇·虹橋·何家角·等處、突有大隊日軍、前往駐守、對於出入人民、盤查更嚴、各水陸交通口、除加派哨兵外、並添置防禦物、在大西路鐵路迤西陳家宅一帶、更有日軍、掘築壕溝、前晨九時左右、由滬西來滬者、均聞隆隆砲聲、及密集機關槍聲、度其情形、似爲日軍實彈演習、惟鑒於日來滬西航行之緊張情緒、恐防游擊隊之襲擊、故而虛張聲勢、用作示威、亦未可知、</p>
<h3>遊擊區　設行政委員會　寶山等縣憶開始進行　將晉省請委督導官吏</h3>
<p>蘇南松屬九縣、自淪入敵手後、轉瞬年餘、然大部份土地、仍在我游擊隊控制中、惟地方行政、不可一日無人、而省府任命之各縣縣長、有迄未蒞任者、游擊隊亦未便越權干涉、故乏領導官吏、地方政治無從推進、各縣地方士紳、及有力份子、爰本愛國護鄕之赤忱、會同聯合組織江蘇省松屬九縣行政委員會、敦聘各縣地方負有資望者、担任委員、一面呈請省府及第　戰區司令部備案、復於各該縣成立縣行政委員會、在縣長未蒞任前、代行職權、輔助政府、推進地方行政、俾與民衆武力、打成一片、現聞寳山等縣、已開始進行、並將推派代表、晋省請委督導官吏、俟上峯核准即可正式成立、</p>

<p>分會公告各幫客商</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會、昨公告米業市塲各帮客商云、查近來米價步漲、巳到原定限價、但現在滬地存米、尙有六七十萬包、來源亦未間斷、一時不致匱乏、爲本市民食計、應仍維持原定限價、最高白米每石不得超過十四元、經本會議决在案、所望各帮客商顧全大局、一體遵照、幸勿踰越限價、以維民食、是所至企、特此公告、中華民國二十八年三月七日、</p>

<p>經荳米行業公會、於本月六日全體執監聯會議决、本市米價、仍維持原定每石十四元限價、不得超過、並發貼公告通知各帮客商遵照辦理、昨晨九時、米業市塲開市後、雖囤戶及客帮到貨、稍有售出、惟數量有限、而銷路特增、故市價依然昇漲、最高市價、除行佣外、已至限價頂點、且有越出之勢、</p>
<p>市場嚴厲執行限價</p>
<p>本市福州路五五〇號米業市塲管理委員會、遵照公會議决、嚴厲執行限價、並爲防止同業行客間在限價之外、私行暗盤賣買、使市價無形中提高、故全體管理委員、均一律蒞塲監視、以資壓制、如查有類似暗盤交易之事情發生、即行報告公會議處、</p>
<p>發表米價飛漲原因</p>
<p>據現代社記者昨向本市豆米行業公會米號業公會暨各帮運米客商等、探詢此次滬市米價飛漲原因、經各該團體發表如下、（一）去年秋熟豐收後、沿江一帶米糧、除供給滬市民食外、而某方在內地搜括運裝出口者、爲數甚鉅、未遭戰事波及之各產地米糧、亦經中央儲積、不准外運、（二）沿江產區、面積有限、經此大量輸一出後、存底有限、致內地行市高一漲、兼之日偽「機關」捐稅繁重、各帮販運虧折、（三）滬市存米雖充足、其大部份均在囤戶手中、據一般觀察、至本年靑黃不接時、米價勢必高漲、奇貨可居、故囤戶不願脫售、以待善價而沽基此上述原因滬市米價驟然高漲、照目前情形暫時尙能壓制、惟將後米糧、有無恐慌、則難逆料、</p>

<h3>鎭江慘況　接得滬報竟遭拘捕　悲慘之事難以盡述</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據鎭江來人談、鎭江之狀態、似可以兩語概述之、即日哨兵之暴行與一般情况之迅趨惡劣是、因郵件遭檢查、故內地披市難以傳出詳確之情况消息、統制人民者、且圖統制人民之心、知識上之奴隸、恐奴隸之不如也、近有若干人民接得郵寄之上海</p>
<p>華字晚報　竟被指犯罪而遭拘捕、蓋當局意欲使人民僅悉彼等願人民知悉之事也、因自由傳達確實消息之途、已遭封閉、故謠諑粉起、顯不足怪、各街道入晚頗爲悽凉、時或九時前即實施戒嚴令，街頭幾黯無點光、城中大街、遇雨天則</p>
<p>泥濘滿地　幾不能通行、若幹商店已蓋陋屋而經營、蓋返城人民、方圖設法糊口也、四鄉晝夜不靖，刦案時聞、悲慘之事迭起、竟不能一一記述之、例如某農夫以其驢脫逃圖、追獲之、不意過一哨兵前、竟遭槍擊、頓時殞生、某商人向哨兵行體時、不意墜其帽、擬加拾取時、竟遭</p>
<p>刺民所戳　摑頰與其他暴行、所起尤多、某婦人因在山側、折取樹枝、竟遭剝去下衣、縛於電桿上、因該處樹枝、他人用作燃料、事實上甚至一草一木、一磚一石、他人似均有用途也、</p>
<h3>財政部核准　免稅洋米一百萬擔　接濟華南潮汕民食　取締操縱保護好居奇</h3>
<p>南潮汕等處糧食、向賴洋米及滬米維持、自江海關不允米糧轉口後、潮汕米商直接向江浙產地採辦、再裝外輪運往調節，旋因日艦阻撓外輪裝米南運，以致潮汕等帮無法向江浙採辦、該地發生米荒、甚爲嚴重、經各團體向政府請求、准予洋米免稅進口、經財政部審查後、轉呈行政院、已核准洋米一百萬擔、免稅進口至潮汕、由米商自由向海外訂購、關於如何杜絕操縱防止居奇、使米價根本平抑、平民獲得實惠、已由粵省政府主席飭何專員巫市長、會同米商妥議辦法、</p>

<h3>日本在華北之貨幣政策失敗（下篇）　結果反犧牲日本銀行紙幣　華北民眾信仰法幣極堅強　日人三土忠造供狀</h3>
<p>白銀擱置　兩租界中、因是項白銀、擬用作「聯準銀行」之最大支待物、其謀攫持乃使」聯準一紙幣之順利流動、受相當妨礙、該「銀行」所受之另一種障礙爲無力隨意出售外匯、蓋「聯準銀行」猶無充量之外幣存款也、而其紙幣、今適與日本銀行之紙幣平價、「華北臨時政府」爲使新紙幣成爲流通於其轄區中之唯一銀行紙幣、乃决將會設分行於平津之華北各銀行所發舊貨幣收回、自一九三八年三月十日起之一年期跟內、舊幣能平換「聯準」紙幣、而總行設上海之華方銀行所發紙幣、卽遭、</p>
<p>禁止流通　估計流通於華北之舊幣共有四萬萬三千元至四萬萬五千元、大多數爲中交兩行之紙幣、自一九三七年三月十日起之九閱月中、「聯準銀行」收回之舊幣不出一千三百萬元、「聯準」紙幣之流通額、約一萬萬五千萬元、其中大部份乃償付軍費而發出者、「聯準銀行」乃效法「滿洲中央銀行」、採取「中央銀行」解决同樣問題之對付舊幣之方法、「中央銀行」成立時、約有舊幣一萬萬四千元、流通於滿洲內百分之九十九、均於</p>
<p>二載半內　收回、但華北之局勢與「中央銀行」成立時滿洲之情况、大不相同、外國租界之存在、爲最大之障碍、因外國銀行非特不與「聯準銀行」之工作相合作、抑且頗加阻碍之、華北民衆之信仟舊幣、勝於新幣、因滿洲之舊幣價低而無信用、故「滿洲中央銀行」開辦之初、即能應購買之要求而出賣外滙、而「聯準銀行」則不能如此、另一重要阻碍之點、厥爲商業情况、蓋華北不若「滿洲國」、除與「蒙藏」之貿易外、其餘貿易入超均頗巨也、凡此種種情况、遂使</p>
<p>獲得外幣　一舉、進展頗爲遲緩、「聯準銀行」紙幣、雖不値一先令二辨士、但與日本銀行紙幣同價、因此一事實、乃使局勢續趨重大、商人旋經鼓勵以舊幣購買「聯準」紙幣、並用「聯準」紙幣償付輸入之日貨、此種辦法其結果卒犧牲日本銀行紙幣、而已使日本銀行受同等之損失、外國銀行拒不承認新貨幣、乃使「聯準銀行」之外滙情况、復多阻碍、據余所聞、外國銀行之意向、似爲彼等不能接受不兌現之貨幣、然「聯準銀行」能以</p>
<p>許多方法　克服上述的華北之貨幣障碍、而事實上業已實行多種方法、爲鼓舞民衆信任新紙幣起見、「聯準銀行」切須獲得充量之外幣存款、而於必要之時、可用此等外幣出售外匯、駐華日本金融專員及「聯準銀行」之管理部刻正作可望成功之努力、加强「銀行」在此點上之實力、爲同一目的起見、華北「當局」已採取統制外滙制度、並對外國貿易實施某數種限制、更迫切而特殊之問題、厥爲三月間舊法幣流通期終止時將如何處置蓋以上所述、截至目前爲止</p>
<p>四萬萬元　中僅收回一千三百萬元也、此後行動途徑、大半將視期限終止時之情况而定，但不問已取何種辦法、流通已久之法幣、或將繼續流通也、在華中貨幣問題、頗與華北類似、我國（指日本）之軍費、刻仍以「軍用票」償付之、但就一般言之人民、對「軍用票」之信任、决不較華北人民對「聯準銀行」紙幣之信任爲高、而在若干內地區域中、日軍當局不得不以自己之紙幣購買法幣後、始能購得任何物品、前曾預料廣州失陷後、法幣將跌價、但與事實</p>
<p>適與相反　法幣之價値反而高漲、且法幣已以上述之形式、而成爲日本銀行紙幣之重負矣、法幣之堅固、或由滙豐銀行之努力、無論蔣介石之命運如何、法幣價値仍將維持、因輸出入間有盈餘故也、日軍將繼續以r軍用票」購買物品、此種「軍用票」將兌成法幣、復以法幣易成外幣、是以根本問題爲如何對付法幣、此顯然切需在華中成立發行獨立紙幣之銀行、該行雖不必大規模從事、但應自始即充份堅强而能</p>
<p>出售外匯　法幣或將暫時不予顧及、而於指定期間、試圖將其收回、如在華北所行者然、並應直接對增進外國商業努力、俾華中之「銀行」或將增加其外幣存款、該「銀行」不應爲純粹之華方機關、而爲中日資本之聯合事業、且其新紙幣不應如「聯準銀行」紙幣之與日本銀行紙幣相連繫、其故顯而易見苟該「行」準備出售外滙者、則其滙兌價値可聽其循自己之方向進行云</p>

<h3>首先發明人造染料者　潘金博士</h3>
<p>— 心君</p>
<p>潘金（Sir　William　H．Perkin)在一八三八年三月十二日生於倫敦，本年三月十二日適爲其百零一至十五歲已得許入皇家化學專門學校，受教於名化學家霍夫孟（Hoffmann）。進步甚速，二年後，已許其開始作硏究工作，其研究之問題爲自煤膠中分出石炭腦，並硝化之。結果雖未能滿意，然絕不因之沮喪。繼改作他種研究，亦頗有成績，因是卽加入該校爲教員。</p>
<p>在一八五六年，潘金正從事硏究製造金鷄納之法，使用商用阿尼林，加以氧化。其結果得一深色之沉澱。由此繼續試騐，卽造出著名之阿尼林紫色染料。人造染料之成功自此發軔，遂樹近代煤膠染料工業之基。</p>
<p>至一八六八年潘金念念不忘其最初研究之物—石炭腦，又繼續研究，得一自石炭腦製造茜素之法。茜素乃一種天然染料。此時雖有他人如卡羅（Caro）格萊勃（Graebe）李伯孟（Libermann）等亦發明製造之新法，但至一八七〇年爲止，潘金所辦之廠名Greenford　Green　Works尙爲惟一之人造茜素化學工廠也。</p>
<p>潘金自始卽抱爲探求眞理而從事研究之高尙志願，故一方面從事染料工業，一方面仍不斷研究其與工業絕無關係之問題。故在一八六八年，得發表共造成零陵香素之法，其後又發表造成桂皮酸之法。因之凡攻讀有機化學者，莫不知有潘金反應焉。</p>
<p>在一八七四年，潘金卽脫離工業，專心一志於科學研究。自建研究室於碩堡利（Sudlury），費數年之時間，硏求磁性旋轉的問題。在一九〇六年，舉行紫色染料發明五十週紀念時，各國著名化學家親往道賀者甚衆。次年七月十四日潘金病歿，年六十九歲。</p>
<h3>煤膠染料發明人——潘金</h3>
<p>— 君琪</p>
<h3>地球之形狀及大小</h3>
<p>— 逸民</p>
<p>大地是一偭球體，現在差不多三尺竄子也知道了，可是吾國在科學沒有發達以前，一致都認地是方的，天是圓的。在歐洲，則當紀元前三四〇年時，希臘哲學家亞利期多德氏已提倡地爲球形之說，並且已有約略計算所得的地球周圍長度。當時雖有這種學說，但是因爲數學的幼稚，儀器的簡陋，以及交通的阻隔，竟一直經歷了二千多年，並沒有更進步的成績。</p>
<p>最初證明地是球形的方法，一定根據天文觀察，並不是從地球本身上着手的，因此把大地當作一個正球形，即幾何學上的球體，已經合乎理想，且認爲够準確的了。至十七世紀，牛頓氏根據力學的原理，始倡地爲r扁球體』之說。後經多數學者不憚勞苦的研究，卒於一七五〇年用實測方法證明，此說。</p>
<p>十九世紀以後，數學果然大有進步，儀器也逐漸精密，測量方法更見巧妙，於是在地球本身上，實地量得多數圓弧，而從事計算，用以確定地球之形狀及大小，這一個科學，名爲「測地學」。一八五九年俄人許培脫氏測定地球爲『橢圓球體』，卽其三個主軸之半徑皆不相等，而仟何一截面皆係橢圓。繼此而研究所得者，有『蛋圓球體』之說，因地球之南北兩半個，並不對稱，而以南半球爲略大。一八七二年又否認此說，因爲地球並不確如蛋形之爲一旋轉體，而係一極不規則之形體。無以名之，名之曰『地球形體』。</p>
<p>近數十年來，對於地球形狀的硏究，可謂不甚注意。因爲地球形體太不規則，在實用上殊不便利。惟有假定他是一個像牛頓所介的扁球體，即由橢圓形繞他較短的一軸，即地球的極軸，旋轉而成，方可在大地測量及天文觀察上應用。此扁球　與實在形體相差至微，幾可不致影響於計算之精密</p>
<p>地球之大小，計有三種不同數値，俱以其長短半徑定之。即經過地球兩極與赤道成正交之子午綫圈爲一橢圓形。此橢圓形之軸，在赤道半面內者爲長軸，在兩極半面者爲短軸。各國學者對此長短軸可測定之數値，略有出入。惟一九〇九年美國測量學家海福德測定長半徑爲六，三七八，三八八米，短半徑爲六，三五六，九〇九米，則已經一九二四年國際測地學及地球物理學協會規定爲國際標準，故在吾國亦當採用之。</p>
<h3>太陽的驚異</h3>
<p>— 錫壺齋主</p>
<p>早在紀元前二百十四年，正當西勒科斯之圍的時候，據說希臘數學家亞基米德曾在岸上用許多火鏡把太陽光集中於羅馬戰船的帆上，結果使敵船失火而潰散。</p>
<p>法國生物學家柏峯（Bnffon）在一七四七年用一百六十八面小平面鏡把太陽光反射而集中於一點，能在七十碼以外使木着火，三十三碼外使鉛鎔解，十六碼外使銀鎔解。</p>
<p>新近美國著名科學家阿柏特博士（Dr．C．Abbott）利用類似的原理造成了一種日是光灶，能單用反射而焦集的太陽光煮熱一頓豐富的大菜。此灶能發生攝氏二百度的溫度。</p>
<p>地球上所以能住人和生長植物，都是太陽所射出全熱量的十萬萬份之二的賞賜。</p>
<p>單就英國說，每年開採二萬五千萬噸左右的煤。但據朗萊教授（Prof．S．P．Langley）計算，即使全世界一切煤礦中的一切煤都付諸一炬，都不能發生太陽在十分之一秒鐘內所射出的那樣多熱量。</p>
<p>地球上的堅硬而重的金屬如鉛，鐵，鋅，銅和銀，若置於太陽的下層大氣中，就成爲氣體而浮起，好像氧氣和氣氣浮於地球的下層大氣中一般。</p>
<p>據計算，太陽內部溫度約有華氏八千萬度之高。假使突然地把它的較冷外充除去，而使核心曝露出來，則地球本身和地球上的一切就可鎔解而消失，比雪花在火爐內消失得更加快。</p>
<p>甚至一個極小的東西如一粒胡桃，只須把它的溫度升高到上述太陽內部的溫度，則假使這胡桃在日本的話，就可使中國熱得不能住人。</p>
<h3>銹的驚人的損失</h3>
<p>— 昔吾</p>
<p>金屬的生銹，在一般人的心目中只是一件區區小事，但據美國某著名工程師的計算，全世界因金屬生銹所蒙受的損失，每年約合五十萬萬美元，在羅斯福總統所提海陸空軍擴充計畫所需全部經費（五五二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元）的九倍以上！</p>
<p>這位工程師告訴我們：全世界的鐵，每年有四分之一變成鐵銹或鐵之氧化物；換句話說，即是復變做鍊鐵的鐵鍍。照理論上講起來，鐵之氧化物雖然可以再鍊成純粹的鐵，但是寳際上卻不可能，因爲大部分鐵銹已經散失而不可收集了。</p>
<h3>科學聊齋</h3>
<p>禳蝗</p>
<p>蝗蟲爲害甚烈，吾國古時有捕蝗者，至今仍有行之者，亦有謂爲天認，蝗神肆虐，以罰一方之罪惡者，此乃教育落後，鄉曲愚民之迷信也。不謂在西方科學昌明之國家，竟有類此可嗤之事。往年美國酉韜省（Utah）發生甚劇之蝗患，樹木田禾，皆遭噬傷，該省人民多係冒孟教徒，（Mormons）耶穌教之一派），乃扶老携幼，來田中伏地祈禱。其地適近大田湖（Greatalt　Lake）湖上海鷗（Gnlls）叢集，鷗性喜食蝗，將該處之蝗，於片刻間捕食幾盡，迨祈禱竣事，見田間已無蝗蟲蹤跡，教徒皆欣然，以爲上帝難應，乃其虔誠禱告之所致云。</p>
<p>夢魚</p>
<p>阿噶息（LouisAgassiz)生物學之大家也，平生著述等身，貢獻極富，默洲生物學鉅子若達爾文，赫胥黎輩，無不推崇之，氏研究學術最勇猛精進，凡受業其門者，咸受其感化，後爲斯學名家。氏幼時游學巴黎，在博物館中硏究魚類化石，適遇有重要之種，而化石殘破過甚，勉强拚對，卒未得其特徵。鑽研旣久，形神交瘁，一夕倦極而寢，其心中尙念念不忘此魚也。旋見該魚游泳於面前，一鱗一鰭，歷歷可數，次晨整理標本，而前夜所夢見者，渺茫不復記憶，繼續苦攻，仍無成功。數日後復於夜間夢之，次晨旋又忘却，於是鑽研愈力，竊思此魚若復入夢。當於夢中繪之，以備參考。乃以鉛筆紙張，置於枕畔，數月後竟復夢見，晨興工作，忽憶及夜間之事，急返臥室索之，果得其圖。遂藉其助，將殘壞之化石凑合完成，該魚種之重要徵象，悉可考覽焉。</p>
<p>鯨腹餘生</p>
<p>英人某在大西洋中捕鯀，一大鯨掠其舟而過，急以銃射之，鯨尾一掉，舟身顚簸，而此人拋起海面，鯨以巨脗承之而下咽焉。此人入鯨食道之中，旋覺背後有極大壓力，擁之而行，以手四處捫之，皆軟滑，如罹黑暗世界，心甚了了，以爲葬身鯨腹，不能再覩天日矣。漸覺熱氣蒸灼，極不可耐，昏迷一無所省，迨醒覺之後，而身在醫院病室中矣。蓋此鯨吞人之後，卽爲他捕者擊斃，剖腹而見此人，氣息僅屬，乃將其送往醫院，共面部及週身各處之皮膚皆糜爛，爲鯨胃液所蝕也。（此人曾於某雜誌詳述此番經騐）。</p>

<h3>講話機器</h3>
<p>— 鴛眞</p>
<p>這講話機，名呌「福德」（Voder），係英國裴耳電話公司實騐室的科學家特萊（H．W．Dudley）和李司（R．R．Riesz）所發明</p>
<p>它是可以置在小桌上的一個輕便機，更可以附加幾個揚聲器，以便達到廣大的聽衆。它有一付鍵，另有十幾個調節器。技術員對於它所發出的聲音，怎樣混和和調節，需得研究，至於熟練，然後可以使用它，收指揮如意之效。它不用任何留聲片，祗需技術員把鍵按捺和把調節器運用，就可以產生各式言語。這確是製造言語的第一座機器。</p>
<p>講話機史有勝人一籌之處。它所發出的音，自最低以至最高，無所不包，不似各人所發的音僅能限於局部。（科學情報，）</p>
<p>襄耳電話實騐室中一架講話機的近視。這位少婦正在用手按著音鍵，發出一種像人聲的言語</p>
<h3>太陽爐</h3>
<p>— 葉人</p>
<p>美國史密生寗研究所威爾生博士（Dr．Charles）在加州一山頂上建成一座日光爐，可洪製麵包，烹煮各種食物。爐之熱源爲日光，而傳熱之媒介爲油。爐上設有一個轉動反射器，能自東往西追隨太陽，將陽光集中於一組盛油之銅管。該管爲日光所灼慹時，管中之慹油無需喞筒之助，自然上升，流入於用防熱材料嚴密包圍之爐中。油變冷時，因重力關係，沉至爐底，回入銅管，再待陽光加熱。因爐之防熱材料能吸收大慹量，故雖在日落之後，該爐猶能煮物歷時頗久。</p>
<h3>世界科學消息</h3>

<p>— （眞理報，培）</p>
<p>龐大的眞空管整流器</p>
<p>無綫電眞空管已有驚人的新進展，將用以輸進數百萬啟羅瓦特的電力於長距離。此種眞空管高達六呎，能耐巨大電壓和巨熱。它在發電機的一端把高壓交流電轉變爲高壓直流，沿傳遞綫傳出，到了用電的地方復由另一隻眞空管把直流變爲交流。向來長距離傳電祇限於交流電而不用直流，因爲交流便於產生，且便於變高變低。但用目前的交流制，傳電的經濟限制祇及二百哩遠，若延長到三百哩，途中漏電將及百分之五十。今若用直流傳遞，因電綫周圍沒有變動的磁塲，故沒有損失。直流電在同一方向內恒定地流動，如一條流速恒定的河道。它的流量只靠傳遞綫的電壓和電綫的電阻。工程師要用直流傳遞的夙願，現因道種整流巨管的新發展而已經達到了。</p>

<p>從海水提鎂</p>
<p>一位德國化學家，近發明一種提鎂的新方法，已向德政府註册。向來的製鎂方法係從普通的菱苦土鑛石提取。這新方法則從氯化鎂！海水中的一種成份—提取；用氫氣使與氯化鎂中的氯化合而析出金屬鎂。</p>

<h3>「三八節」與獻金</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>重慶婦女獻金七十萬，正是上海婦女的一個好榜樣！</p>
<p>上海的闊太太，並不少於重慶。而上海闊太太的消耗，我相信一定較多於重慶闊太太。因爲重慶遠在內地，一般的享用都粗淺，欲求消耗而不得，上海則不然，在享用方面，應有盡有，什麼都有，素來是一個「漏巵」。那末，上海闊太太，甚至不必大闊的太太，只要略略節省一下，也來獻金，其成績的美滿，雖不一定超過重慶，總也不會讓重慶專美於前吧。</p>
<p>然而至今天，我並沒有聽見上海婦女，對於獻金這事，有過什麼舉動。這是爲什麼呢？難道蔣委員長說，「婦女的力量勝於男子」，只適用於重慶，而不適用於上海嗎？</p>
<p>婦女的力量勝於男子，在某幾點上我是很相信的；至少在節約和佈施道二件事情上，婦女比了男子更有力量。然而上海婦女，對於獻金，爲什麼就寂寂一無所聞呢？對於消耗，却還在繼長增高呢？</p>
<p>我不要說，上海婦女的愛國心，不及重慶婦女；但是我却要說，上海婦女的活動力量，的確還有相當的缺陷。這缺陷的形成，婦女領袖的不肯自動發起，社會人士，尤其負責指導民運的機關，不肯從旁推動，大概不能辭其咎吧。</p>
<p>現在，「三節」到了，我們在報上所已看見的是：「時値國難，停止慶祝議式」，此外則是一紙宣言。在宣言中雖然也說婦女要「救難」並「獻盆」，但是我們並沒有看見這些具體的工作。</p>
<p>我不相信上海之大，闊太太之多，根本就沒有婦女獻金這會事！</p>
<p>假使闊太太不肯起而自効，一般的太太和小姐，爲什麼也沒有一毫點綴呢？</p>
<p>上海婦女界如此沉寂，尤其關於獻金，如此不聞不問，我簡直要說，上海不應該有「三八節」！</p>
<h3>趙四爺的死</h3>
<p>— 何龍昇</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>趙四爺之在江橋，猶如活佛之在西藏一樣，是沒有一個人不知道，不敬服的。</p>
<p>戰事西移着，漸漸迫近江橋，四爺精神更顯得悲愴了。後來他囑附家人趕快預備行裝，到六十里之外的西村去暫避，又把三百元法幣交給他的長女，催促快些起身。家裹人於涕淚交流中，終於坐了一隻小船，離開了江橋。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>「四爺，快起來！　　兵到城外了。」江橋商會會長，旣不洗臉，也沒戴帽，直奔到趙四爺的臥房，商量應付的方法。</p>
<p>「怎麼？到城外了，不是還在小河邊打麼？」四爺吃驚地翻起身來。</p>
<p>「我們這邊沒有了子彈，昨晚上敵人又添了兵，因之不能支持，全退進城了。」商會會長給四爺解釋。</p>
<p>「唔，那麼城裹還有彈藥嗎？」四爺一面下床，一面緊迫着問。</p>
<p>「也沒有了，所以我來請四爺……」商會會長正急着，飛機聲已在空中響了起來。趙四爺知道形勢已很危險，便斷然地說：</p>
<p>「這樣吧，守城大概不行了，城裹旣沒子彈，外面援軍一時又不會開到，我看還是讓軍隊趕快衝出去罷。軍隊到外邊還可以設法補充，等槍械齊全了，再來攻城。我們在城裹的人就內應，不怕敵人不全盤覆滅！」</p>
<p>「嗡嗡嗡……鼕——」</p>
<p>「嗡嗡嗡……轟——」</p>
<p>敵人的飛機已開始擲彈r，城內立刻起了紛亂的喊聲；大砲也接着轟動起來。</p>
<p>「鼕……轟……」</p>
<p>「鼕……轟……」</p>
<p>「都都都……轟……」</p>
<p>「吧兒，吱—」</p>
<p>「吧兒，吱—」</p>
<p>「咕隆隆隆，咕隆隆隆，鼕—」</p>
<p>各種奇異的槍聲，都響在人們頭頂上．天空烟霧飛騰着；城中心，已冒起黑烟，火光繼續着上昇。四爺正勾着拖鞋在街上跑。</p>
<p>情形更紊亂了，街道上塞滿了行人。男的，女的，老的，少的，哭呌混成了一片。四爺臉上很悲苦，但不說一句話，祇一直向駐軍的文廟跑。飛機在狂吼着，子彈依然在天空飛奔。火光從四面昇起，廟中的駐軍，早開拔了。四爺急忙奔出了廟跑到徐文彬家裹。徐文彬不知到那裏去了，他底家屬却都聚在堂屋裹哭哭啼啼。四爺感到事情更困難，只得又辭了出來；再跑到長街，打居心園飯館的門。</p>
<p>「是誰？」鬥內有了應聲，但却不開門。</p>
<p>「我是趙四爺！」四爺只得自己報名。</p>
<p>「呵！四爺。快進來！我們以爲你已經走了呢。」</p>
<p>門只開了一扇，四爺溜了進去，又關上了。在另一個屋子裏，四爺和老闆，廚子們嘰哩咕嚕說了好些話，便出來了。送四爺出來的飯館老闆，臉上現着難色；跟在老闆背後的廚子，却笑嘻嘻地。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>是　軍入城二十四小時以後的事情了。趙四爺以地方維持會會長的資格，在商會裹歡宴　軍大小長官。到席的，除　軍方面三十多個軍事長官外，還有一般從前失意而現在爲　軍出力的地方特殊人物。趙四爺爲勸誘客人多吃多喝起見，海闊天空地談論着　軍的恩德，並飲着多量的酒。但席未終止，他就睡了過去，大家以爲他是醉了，仍舊興高釆烈地吃喝着。歇了一會，客人們却都顯着異樣；有的喊肚痛，有的說頭昏，終於各個都倒在地上。結果，總共死了二十六個　軍長官和五個地方上的特殊人物。</p>
<p>趙四爺有着蓄意謀害的罪，給架去了，便在　軍憲兵的槍口之下，在木然無所知覺的軀體上，又飲了幾十粒子彈。</p>

<h3>我的心</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>我雖然陷在這黑暗的地獄裏，可是我的心，卻已不在這裹了！</p>
<p>我的心不知怎樣會離開這裹。飛了出去？跳了出去？總之，牠是掙扎出去的。</p>
<p>我的心是純潔的，汚穢染不了牠！</p>
<p>我的心是光明的，黑暗遮不着牠！</p>
<p>我的心是崇高的，卑微壓不倒牠！</p>
<p>我的心出去了，牠負着很大的使命，牠去「找尋」。</p>
<p>牠不是找尋極樂的世界，黃金之國，或是象牙之塔；牠不需要這些！</p>
<p>牠不是我尋美麗的鮮花，夜光珠，或是翡翠，瑪瑙；牠不愛這些！</p>
<p>牠去找尋「正義」，在「正義」裏藏着最鋒利的武器，拿來在黑暗中搏鬥！</p>
<p>我的心毫無懼怕地去了，牠不願在魔鬼的爪蹄下做黃金色的夢！</p>
<p>牠去了，飛去的，跳去的，我可不知道！</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>葉團長把改編計劃書交給獨眼李，獨眼李却連一個大字都不識，只好紅着臉交給蕭麻子。蕭麻子接過來看了一遍，那上面的條件很簡單，第一是要他們把槍枝和隊伍的花名册交出來，其次是汰弱留强，刷新編制。不過他們所最關心的改編後個人的位置，計劃書上却完全沒有提到。</p>
<p>蕭麻子對獨眼李施了個眼色，仍舊把計劃書遞還給葉團長，冷笑了一聲說：</p>
<p>『這樣的辦法，不就是吞併咱們嗎？　要吞併乾脆的說吞併好了，何必城頭上出棺材，遠兜轉的？』</p>
<p>葉團長的濃眉一跳，把手按住了杯子說：</p>
<p>『你們不要誤會，我是一番好意，希望你們加進來，可以增强抗　游擊戰爭的實力。』</p>
<p>『多謝！多謝！』蕭麻子冷笑着把手朝上一拱說『請不必再用好話來欺騙咱們了，你們在合浦鎭，咱們在苕溪鎭，咱兩家河水不犯井水…………』</p>
<p>葉團長再也忍耐不住了，一張國字臉氣得通紅，他跳起身來，把手裏的一隻酒杯在地上「乒」的聲挪得粉碎說：</p>
<p>『說什麼河水不犯井水！我是堂堂國民政府軍事委員會所任命的官吏，有保衛民衆除暴安良的責任，不能聽憑你們這批土匪的地方上無法無天，胡亂橫行！』</p>
<p>這是一個暗號，就在擲杯聲中，屏門後埋伏着的兵士一哄而出，個個手裏都執着步槍盒子砲。蕭麻子見形勢不妙，一起手就把席面推翻，獨限李加上一脚，把桌子都踢倒了，各自從腰間拔出傢伙來。獨眼李雖然只有一隻眼睛，可是他却兩手都能開槍，說時遲，那時快，大廳上連珠般響了一陣槍聲，左右廂房裹埋伏着的兵士也都開起槍來。在這T字形的交射下，蕭麻子喊了聲「哎喲」，撲的倒下地去，獨眼李却仍舊很曉勇的一面向外跑，一面兩手朝後開槍。</p>
<p>葉團長見獨眼李如此驍勇，惟恐被他脫逃，便從梁團附手裹取過支左輪手槍來，親自對他放了三槍。這三槍都打在獨眼李身上，可是奇怪，獨眼李仍舊豪髮無傷的向外跑。（二七）</p>
<h3>宋朝的二個傀儡皇帝</h3>
<p>— 杰</p>
<p>——讀史隨筆</p>
<p>金人侵略宋朝，曾經二次設立傀儡政府，實行以華制華的毒計。第一次在靖康二年，金兵攻進汴京，把徽欽二帝擄去，另立宋臣張邦昌爲楚帝。但後來金兵北回，張邦昌也就退位，只做了三十六天的短命皇帝。第二次設立傀儡政府是在建炎三年，金人立劉豫爲齊帝，劉豫過了八年的皇帝癮，也被金人廢掉。</p>
<p>張邦昌與劉豫雖同是萬世唾罵的漢奸，但二人也有程度之差。張邦昌做傀儡，是被金人硬拉出來的，而非出於自願，所以他登台做傀儡後，還有些顧忌，不敢妄作妄爲。他召見百官，自稱「予」，不敢稱「朕」。委任官職，都加一個「權」字，表示這上暫時性質的。他派人去奉迎宋康王，自己陳訴說：『所以勉循金人推立者，欲權宜一時，以紓國難耳，非敢有他也。』可見張邦昌還不算是漢奸，只能說是一個糊塗的傀儡罷了！</p>
<p>但劉豫却是一個十足道地的賣國漢奸！劉豫做愧儡，並不是金人捧出來的，而是自己去鑽營求得的。他把重金寳賂去運動敵人撻懶。做了八年的僞皇帝，非但沒有半些羞恥顧忌之心，反甘心作敵人的鷹犬，幾次引兵人寇祖國，眞可算喪心病狂之至了！</p>
<p>張邦昌劉豫這二個叛國的傢伙，後來都沒有好結果。張邦昌雖然後來反正到宋朝來，但叛國逆臣，國法所不容，終於被宋高宗賜死。劉豫有金國要人撻懶，粘罕二人的靠山，纔能上台；但後來撻懶粘罕二人失勢，靠山一倒，漢奸失了憑藉，終於被他的主子（金人）廢掉。金人把他囚在金明池，偽皇帝變作階下囚，結果奄奄而死在敵國裹。這二個傀儡皇帝的下塲，同樣悲慘，大可以作為目前漢奸的殷鑑！</p>

<h3>紀念三八節</h3>
<p>— 谷風</p>
<p>加強婦女運動的推進</p>
<p>雖然中國婦女早在辛亥革命前的大革命時代就有若干婦女們參加了在一起革命，甚至也有因此而殉難的，（像著名的秋瑾烈士等）然而這是太少數中的少數，她只限於當時有限的受過教育中的比較前進的一小部份，她們在全國婦女的總人口上，只是微渺的一斑，占不到一點百分比的，而辛亥後的歷次的革命運動，婦女們的參加雖已比較上逐漸推廣，普及，但也還是少數，一部份，所以嚴格地說，眞正的婦女運動，是從七七全面抗戰爆發後才開始的，七七事變不僅替古老的中華民族換上一個新的劃時代的標幟，使整個的中華民族走上團結一致，全力抵抗暴敵的道路，同時也促使婦女們自發自覺地走上解放自由的一途</p>
<p>在這次抗戰中，中國的婦女動員之多，無疑是打破了歷史上一切的紀錄的。在抗戰第一的大　下，大批大批的歸女，隨着戰事的演進，業已蜂擁地跑出了廚房，拋下了兒女私情，參加入羣眾的團體中，她們往前綫在雨一般的槍砲下，從事救援傷兵，她們在專炸平民及救護人員以及第三國生命財產的日機下，忙着醫療，看護，她們在前綫，在後方，不斷地奔波，勞働，做着各種救亡工作，全日全夜的工作，任勞任重沒有一些怨意，她們同男子一般的勇敢，能幹，勤苦，耐勞，外國某記者在視察中國後的讚譽中國婦女是全世界最進步的女性，眞是極忠實的批判。</p>
<p>但我們要明白的指出的抗戰後的婦女運動，雖不論在質的方面在量的方面全有了長足的進步，但從全面看來，婦女運動還有着只是浮面的，片段的，限於上層份子的缺點，她沒有深入於占全國婦女大多數的勞慟婦女，農村婦女，下層婦女的陣容，她更沒有普及地把婦女運動推廣到未來抗戰根據地的邊疆去，她始終是逗留在局部的繁榮的城市裏，這所招致的不良的惡果是，不能配合全面長期抗戰所必需的普遍性與全面性，因爲她們是點的，綫的，無組織的。</p>
<p>尤其是留存在孤島的上海婦女，也許戰事的西移，她們認爲是與本身不復相關的吧，因而她們依舊是像平日一樣的過生活，打牌，看戲，跳舞，好出風頭，這些占據了她們的全部，同時更滿不在乎地服用着仇貨，使仇貨的入超飛躍地增加。抗戰在她們看來是一部份人的事</p>
<p>在今天紀念三八國際婦女節的當兒，我們希望婦女們在行過開會的形式後，前者已參加抗戰工作的婦女們，本着已往的精神，注力於深入的普遍的下層工作，而後者更應立刻地矯正自己錯誤，荒唐，自私的態度，至少要站在自己的崗位上，實行與抗戰有益的事，如不賣買仇貨，不涉足靡亂場所，節約救濟難民，勸募購買公債等。</p>
<p>綜而言之，婦女大眾要在抗戰中完成婦女的解放運動，必需把自身加入抗戰，同時把抗戰的意識灌溉給下層的婦女羣，使婦女運動普遍地發展。</p>

<h3>牢獄天堂觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>Up　The　RIVER</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯出品　大光明開映</p>
<p>「牢獄天堂」是以牢獄爲背景的一張滑稽片。大概正是滑稽片之故吧，像偵探片中那樣的陰沉沉的感覺是掃除了，取而代之的是像療養院或俱樂部那樣的東西，「牢獄天堂」的報紙廣告有云：「含笑入監牢，宛如登天堂：進出隨君便，賽球奪錦標。可以會情侶，可以做唱跳，三餐酒飯飽，一　到天亮。」把牢獄描寫得如此美化，那正是使人神往不置的。不久前我們在社會新聞上讀到過一位生活無法解决者自認行竊請求入獄的新聞，當時是頗引起了一些廉價的同情，以爲其情可悲，其人可憐，而人生若斯，那也正可以休矣。現在看了「含笑入監牢，宛如登天堂」的「牢獄天堂」之後，則覺得這位自認行竊者倒不失爲一個聰明人，「三餐酒飯飽，一　到天亮，」較之於睏弄堂喫皮鞋脚挨疼受餓者，自是高出一籌。</p>
<p>這様說來，是頗有鼓動窮人犯罪之嫌的，萬一羣起效尤，把牢獄擠破，或是被迫而不得不掛出客滿牌子，豈不連警務當局也將東手無策？實際上，牢獄生活當然沒有如「牢獄天堂」中所描寫的那様「寫意，」可是我們已經有了自認行竊以圖日飽三餐夜得一宿者了，（在美國，這様的人也不會沒有吧？）若是悞滑稽爲正經，也想一登「天堂」起來呢？</p>
<p>這看起來好像是杞人之憂，牢獄不成其爲免費療養所，正如牢獄不能改造社會柑同，但把牢獄美化起來，形容其爲「天堂，」則其爲荒唐，其爲無稽而無益，則自也不說自明矣。悞滑稽爲正經，認牢獄爲天堂的笨伯大概不會有吧？可是「牢獄天堂」的主題呢？</p>
<p>解釋好萊塢影片的攝製動機大都是可以「生意眼」包括之的，滑稽影片的荒唐，無稽，想入非非，更是司空見慣，不足爲怪。因之，在牢獄中「賽球奪錦標，」「可以做唱跳」乃至男扮女裝怪氣怪腔的跳舞，遂也好像份當然耳。這樣滑稽片之爲紳士淑女們所歡迎，並且每下愈况，乃亦適足證明資本主義的所謂藝術，已到了怎樣的一個階段。</p>
<p>誠然，「牢獄天堂」也有寫所謂「友愛」的：「湯美欲越獄逃至春谷鎮，揭發密等陰謀，摩達兩人聞悉其事，慨然願爲臂助，相約於監獄舉行聯歡會之夜逃走，摩達二人以湯美即將宣誓出獄，逃獄反爲不利，乃於臨逃之際，將湯美擊昏於地，匆匆衣女服喬扮婦女，」但這與其說是爲了描寫「友愛，」還不如說是爲賣弄噱頭或是爲最後的高潮來得確當，在這張滑稽片的最後一個高潮裹，是須要這兩個逃獄的「明星球員」來爲洛克爾監獄球隊爭光的。</p>
<p>總而言之，一切佈置，都是爲的使滑稽片抄什錦化，用監獄做背景者，拆穿一句話，也祗楚爲溶香艷緊張滑稽於一爐而已，牢獄是圾好成爲緊張的背景的。</p>
<p>導演者和劇本是統一的，他也儘量强調這點，如男扮女裝的跳舞之類。演員都是二三流脚色，固然，像這樣的滑稽片，所須的原祇是擠眉弄眼扮鬼臉玩雜耍，表情聖手，反而會英雄無用武之地。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡糊</p>
<p>朱愛人道：『那你雖不是一位大小姐，也是一位小小姐了。』吳君素道：『可不是嗎？總之裝飾是她們最大的經濟，最注意的教育。其實打扮好了，也未必天天出去游玩，有時就在自己家裹，頂多幾個姊妹間往來。我那時已進小學念書了，嘴裹小敢說，他們這様打扮好了，給誰看呢？給自己看嗎？在蘇州的年靑女子，也出不了什麼風頭，什麼交際之花等種種名稱，都要到了上海纔行。及至戰爭起後，不久蘇州就變爲淪陷區。有田的人家，還想收租米嗎？有的田巳經荒蕪了，就是沒有荒的田，也休想收到租米。市房呢，轟炸的轟炸了，燒的燒了，强佔的强佔了。所開的店舖，關門的關門了，搶的搶了，刦的刦了。向來所靠爲收入的，此刻可稱一無所有。那時上海還有租界，只好逃到租界裹去。有不及逃的，那惟有在游擊區裹受難了。我們有位堂房叔叔，他從前也是寫意朋友，所謂少爺班子也者，吃飽了飯，觀前街踱踱的。後來實在搶光境光，無可爲計，家中待哺嗷嗷。想了一個法子，弄了幾包香烟賣賣，擎了一個托盤，到茶舘裹去兜生意。因爲道比較輕巧一點，若是笨重的東西，我這位叔叔是個文弱的人，他也拿不動。可是他自出娘胎，何會做過這種事，見了熟入，把一把扇子，遮了自已面孔，羞慚得不得了。恰巧遇着一個在他家裹做過小當差的，此刻在「維持會」裏，當了什麼科員，也在茶館裹吃茶。見了他，就說：「咦！大少爺在賣香烟嗎？給我一包白金龍。」嚇得他端了托盤就跑，險些兒跌了一交。至於女的呢，因爲敵兵毫無紀律，往往蹂躪女性。所以都跑到鄉下去住。有幾位穿慣了高跟皮鞋的人，連平底鞋子也穿不來，反說脚底痛。但鄉下地方，高跟皮鞋也不好走路，幷且也不許你再摩登了。只好穿了鄉下姑娘的杜翻棉襖，包了包頭布，脚上穿了靑布杜做鞋子。　有兩個紅拽拔。仿了江北人裝束，紮了兩隻褲脚管，臉上只好用鍋底灰，塗了個滿面，弄得烏弗三，白弗四。這樣打扮，有時還瞞弗過敵兵的眼睛，遮遮掩掩，那也苦透了。』（五五）</p>
<h3>「繁榮」後的億定盤路</h3>
<p>— 奚人</p>
<p>億定盤路，它是　安寺以內在大西路與愚園路兩路之間的惟一的南北橫路。曹家渡方面的人要到徐家匯等地方去，都得經過道裹；尤其在曹家渡工廠區裹做工而集居在大西路一帶的人，億定盤路更是他們進出的要道。每天的侵晨和傍晚，更是他們上工和下工的交替時間，滿街的來來往往儘是些人影。</p>
<p>記得是八一三戰事發生後的第二個月，我的足跡開始印上了億定盤路。那時的它，還是一個淡妝素抹的少女，處處都顯示出一個少女所有的端靜的個性，一點也沒有濃鬱的氣氛。偶然在光滑的柏油路上疾駛過一二輛載着漂亮的少男少女的汽車，發出一陣嗚嗚的聲響外，餘外可以說沒有些微的騷擾。</p>
<p>但是現在，它已脫去淡樸的素妝，換上了滿是脂粉氣的濃裝。耀眼的電炬，閃爍的年紅燈，一切大都市中所有的外形，都巳在這條靜穆的道路上裝扮起來，造成了它目前的「繁榮」。以前屋左一帶綠草地上，目前也已建造起一幢幢房屋，一幢幢醜陋異常的房屋，推窗滿望，儘是一行行黑瓦的行列，昔前的鄉村風味，目前也無從領略了。</p>
<p>但是我對於他的「繁榮」，却始終有些懷疑：是正常的繁熒？是畸形的發展？</p>
<p>矗立在路中段的　　公司的年紅燈，一閃閃地發出卑鄙的亮光，引誘着意志不定的人向他們的魔窟裹走去；去把用自已的汗血換來的辛苦錢奉敬給那些魔窟裏的爪牙們使用。</p>
<p>黃邊帽草綠衣的僞「警」，也是這裹的特有點綴。沒有搶的奴子階級的他們，一根尺來長的木棍就是惟一武器了。雖然，他們也會在馬路中踱上幾步，但光景是够悽慘的，不敢正眼看人，丟玩丟玩木棍就是工作了，還有爲「俱樂部」之類的賭窟看門倒也是「專門工作」之一。</p>
<p>虛幻的繁榮，本是道孤島都市畸形發展的本色，但我們不需要這些，我們所需要的是正常的繁榮，但要建造起正常繁榮的某礎，首先得把製造出虛幻繁榮的魔鬼攢走！</p>
<h3>關於「學校新聞」</h3>
<p>— （益民）</p>
<p>讀本攔三月四日次愷君發表「談談學校刊物」一文，內容頗見精彩，惟對於「學校新聞」，頗有出入之處，爰加以補充數點如後。</p>
<p>關於上海所發行之「學校新聞」，固負有特殊之使命，係華東聯中校友錢一鳴蔣廷　等所創辦完全係個人性質，與華東聯中毫無連繫之關係。至以前杭州所出版之「學校新聞」，刊物立場雖屬相同，但背景則各有所殊，按當時杭州所出版者，係浙江省黨部幹事余剛夫，華封等所主持，與中國靑年勵志會有直接關係。該刊初時每週僅出四開本一張，旋因讀者驟增，乃改出十六開本一冊，其內容之取材，較近來在滬出版者爲精彩，當時該刊在杭銷數，約在千份以上，行銷外埠者，遠達寗靑甘陝及香港澳門等地。該刊早經中宜部內政部登記，其刊名與字體，巳經教育部註冊，他人概不得襲用，聞此次在滬發行之「學校新聞一二方負責人，亦均於事先有所商洽也。關係此次上海之「學校新聞」停刊原因，傳係因環境關係，不得已暫時休刊。近據確息，不日即有復刊可能，並聞該刊此次復刊，並非單獨發行，每週將暫時附刊於「上海寗波公報」，業已在積極籌復之中，約下週內即可實現。</p>

<h3>醇酒廬劇話（上）</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>國事蜩螗，四郊多壘，除却悲歌。豈復尚有生趣乎。偶爾顧曲。意有所觸，隨筆記之，名曰醇酒廬劇話。</p>
<p>某日，觀武旦閻世善演竹林記，色藝均絕，聞世善爲九陣風之子，若爲閻九之子，當屬朱文英之外孫，文英在今之武旦中稱前輩，同行中呼爲朱四十者，資望次於俞毛包，而功夫相埒，其子桂芳，亦以武且名，世善容貌昳竉，頗似桂芳，何無忌酷似其舅，朱閻兩氏，可稱武旦世家，而閻九可謂有子矣，閻九當年，武工冠一時，兼唱花旦，但嫌過火，不免有求全之毀，世善之武工，與其父較短論長，當在伯仲之間，單就穩健婀娜論，似尚過之，若能從馬上緣鐵弓緣一派戲，轉入閨門旦，在旦角中，可望佔一席位，願世善勉旃</p>
<p>其後爲楊實森之珠廉寨，寶森實余叔岩傳人，前數年之嗓音韻味有餘，剛勁不足，名票鄭過宜君與寶森交誼極厚，常抱杞人之憂，不恥下問及愚，愚常草一文，登之報端，謂竇森之歌，醇厚古質，有黃鏡之遺意，正在成人之時，中氣單薄，不能努力，故少剛勁之音，若待三十歲後，體力充實，音調自然充沛，光陰荏苒，寶森今三十而立矣，是日演珠廉寨，自出場迄終場，音韻清越，似鶴唳九皋，充沛如江流三峽，可稱極清濁剛柔之能事矣，近時知名之老生，凡注重做工者，大都模仿小丑，以顚頭播腦指天畫地爲能事，凡研究唱腔者，大都模彷花衫，以墊字讓板油腔滑調爲能事，均不從老生身份上着想，寶森處今之世，不阿俗取容，使歌臺猶留正聲，愚深服其毅力，惟李克用坐傷詩，舊本有二，（一）「太白斗酒詩百篇長安市上酒家眠一此譚鑫培之脚本，鑫培死，後兩句遂不傳，北平包丹庭與陳墨香兩名票皆知之，但視爲不傳之秘，丹庭曾與憑談及，今將二十年矣，年老健忘，不能復憶。（二）「憶昔當年征土蠻，　　　　　　　打死國舅段文楚，唐王一怒貶北番」今之凈角，皆念此詞，兩詩有雅俗之別，斷不能混而爲一，叔岩此戲，並非鑫培所親授，不知何人將此兩詩割裂雜凑，至今日遂成訂本，愚深望寶森善取叔岩之長，而勤補其缺，有以正之，庶不負此天才也。</p>
<h3>歷史影片三種觀後感</h3>
<p>— 希同</p>
<p>舊歷年內，歷史影片三種同時演出，即：滬光的木蘭從軍，金城的孟姜女和新光的楚霸王。</p>
<p>三片中當以「木蘭從軍」爲最好，編劇者歐陽予倩手法高妙而且新穎，含義又多雙關，演出者陳雲裳婀娜矯健，各盡其致，這些都是使得「木蘭從軍」出人頭地之處。木蘭的父親士榮即以木蘭的箭來拆公文，甚爲自然巧妙。木蘭臨別時，父母都哭，獨有小弟弟歡欣跳躍，這暗示年輕的一代將猛勇精進，對敵抗戰。月夜叙情一段尤佳，使人想起梁紅玉中的一節。惟以月喻人，有光無月，稍感美中不足。木蘭探險被發覺，未能聳身一躍上馬，技藝似不及西片勇武。</p>
<p>孟姜女第八景松江城門，行人經過都要向守衛者鞠躬，方許過去，使人自然而然的想到限前的事情。第三十八景老者獻亂，說是偷來的，關官竟亦收下，也使人想到這是實情。可是後來關官又把雞還給老者，似乎把觀眾的聯想打斷了。我以爲關官不應可憐老百姓，孟姜女唱完後應加以哄笑。根本關官不應由丑角扮演，該由洪警鈴等扮演纔更有意義；是否合符傳說，倒是不重要的</p>
<p>楚霸王說白簡直是翻板「史記，」文縐縐的，非一般民眾所能懂，稍感不自然。王元龍的楚霸王演得很不錯，窮途末路，欲哭無淚，表現得尤爲深刻。其次我頗賞議韓信（傳威廉飾，）英俊之氣，撲人眉宇。張良的服裝似應穿華麗一些的，年紀也應輕一些。樊哈受賜的一塊豚肩太小了。最後能脫出史記，刪去迷路勸渡兩場，在落照中自殺，值得稱讚</p>
<p>戰爭的塲面，楚霸王自較木蘭從軍爲嚴肅而眞切。山均和晚間的戰爭比較上像眞的，因爲畫面空地較少，或者較爲模糊。最初的幾仗在一片平原上只有稀稀落落　的二三十個人，如踢足球，甚為兒戲。（木蘭從軍則如打排球，成兩條直綫）如果這幾個場面能將空地縮小，較近拍攝，必更像眞。</p>
<h3>李綺年售照助賑</h3>
<p>— （港寄）</p>
<p>港紅女星李綺年，本澳門名花，嗣投身影界，以表演浪漫風騷女性見長，而竿頭日上，今已爲港中女星最著聲譽者。惜其人個性驕傲，爲識者所不取；與電影界中人大多不睦，而每片演金，最少須千元以外，一般小公司難以問鼎，陳雲裳之飛黃騰達，成功迅速者，固李綺年之「驕傲」所「賜」也。李脫離賣笑生活之初，曾至滬擬投身聯華公司，未錄取，因對故女星阮玲玉女士演藝心折，而留滬時日至聯華參觀阮演戲，勤習觀摩，頗得阮玲玉女士演技眞髓，故李在港有南國阮玲玉之別號。近李特將歷年來所攝照片二百五十張，假高羅士打酒店開個人撮影展覽會，收門券二毫，供眾參觀，並將照片標價發售，全部收入，則悉充善舉，賑濟難民，所陳列之照片，其中半身裸影佔十分之二，戲裝估十分之一，游泳照佔十分之三，其他騎馬等不一，此雖籍「賑」爲名，宣傳是實，但亦未可厚非，故頗得一般人之同情焉。</p>

<p>精忠廟被香火道人侵佔的秘聞</p>
<p>後來焦老道死啦，王少樓又日有起色，小老道何某遂又收少樓做乾兒子。少樓首次來滬，因爲報界沒有熟人，於是何某也就隨之南下，替他張羅一切，在北平的時候，只要伶界裹有了婚喪嫁娶的事情，他們師徒總是搶在頭裹，報上發新聞之外，整日的照應辦事，份子又出的比別人厚實，因此戲班裹都還同他師徒合得來。他們見時機業已成熟，遂先下手把廟裹立的兩塊石碑給砌在二門兩旁的牆壁上，起先字跡還甚清晰，未逾兩年，即將字跡及創建該廟年月人名，盡行塗去。再過幾日，父在大門前新造一所市房，開設一爿磁器店，整個的把精忠廟的廟門掩起，日久年深，現在已經有許多人不知道故都的精忠廟在什麼地方啦。廟內雖也裝着電燈電話，然而電話簿上却是慶元德磁器店出面的。大殿的樓上樓下，一年到頭，全在封鎖之下。不佞爲着好奇心的驅使，當參觀該廟的那天，趁着老道不在面前，用指尖把格扇門上的白紙點破，望內一看，瞧見很多的匾額堆置地上，最醒目的是一塊紅底金字的橫額，下款的字，非常粗大，所有的人名全是綁子班的著名人物，如郭實臣·田際雲·侯俊山諸人，全列名其上。大殿的中央，尚存有梨園祖師的神龕，樓上兩壁間留有很工細的壁畫，滿地上也是堆着很多的區，遭些東西都是很笨重的，一時不易燬滅，所以還暫時保留。倘再過數年後，如瑤鄉昆仲及其他三數老伶工掃數故世後，老道把神龕·壁晝·匾額·一齊焚燬後，則精忠廟的遺蹟，就全行淹沒了。現存的故都伶人，並不是不知道他們師徒的用意，不過你也碍於交情，我也不願多事，好在這是前人心血金錢換下來的遺產，與本身是毫不相干的，何必去得罪人呢？有錢的名伶，當然不想沾到廟中利益，就是有幾位生活困難些的，找到香火道人時，也是有求必應，如此一來，這座有戲劇歷史性的精忠廟，遂於無形中被守廟的道人侵佔去了。</p>

<h3>White-Blade Battle Occurs in Zhongxiang City; Elite Chinese Troops Gather in the Xiangfan Area; Fierce Four-Day-and-Night Battle on the Jing-Zhong Road for Seven or Eight Contested Points; Japanese Reinforcements Attempt to Invade Northward Along the Xiang River Valley; Chinese Left-Wing Forces Vigorously Attacking the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Jingmen Telegram: The battle in central Hubei continues fiercely. Japanese forces have increased to four regiments. Near the East Bridge on the Jing-Zhong Road, Chinese and Japanese troops have fought fiercely for four days and nights, contesting seven or eight points. As of the sixth, the battle continues. A certain Chinese unit in Zhongxiang was heavily attacked by the Japanese for three days. A small portion of the position was breached, but after reinforcements arrived, the situation stabilized. Currently, a certain unit on the Chinese left wing is attacking the Japanese. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese troops invading Zhongxiang continue to aggressively advance north along the highway, attempting to cross the Xiang River and harass Jingmen and Yicheng. Certain Chinese units have been reinforced and are currently counterattacking. In the vicinity of Zhongxiang, Chinese troops continue to resist. Fierce battles between Chinese and Japanese forces are also occurring near Changshou Shop, Majiaji, and Da Dai Zi Mountain north of Zhongxiang, resulting in numerous Japanese casualties. The defense of the Xiang River is secure. (Special dispatch, 3:00 AM, 8th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the situation on the Xiang River front has suddenly become tense. After a minor engagement with Japanese forces one mile southeast of Zhongxiang on Sunday night, they have invaded Zhongxiang, resulting in a white-blade battle in the city. Simultaneously, another group of Japanese troops is attacking Wangjiaji, twenty miles north of Zhongxiang. Elite Chinese troops are now gathering in the Xiangyang and Fancheng area, anticipating a Japanese advance north along the Xiang River valley. Thirteen Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Xiangyang and Fancheng yesterday morning. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, Japanese forces occupied Zhongxiang, a town on the Danshui River about 120 miles northwest of Hankou, on Sunday. A new development has occurred on the sixty-mile battle line in central Hubei. According to a Central News Agency report, the Japanese occupied Zhongxiang after suffering over a thousand casualties. Judging from the current situation, the military appears to be preparing to attack west towards Shashi. In the past two weeks, Japanese forces have forced Chinese troops within the Heshui River loop to the west bank of the Hanshui River. The Japanese are preparing to cross the Hanshui River at Zhongxiang, Jiukou, and Yuekou. Yesterday, both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire at various points along the Hanshui River. According to Chinese reports, in the two weeks before occupying the various points within the Hanshui River loop, the Japanese suffered 5,000 casualties. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Yichang) A portion of the Japanese forces that infiltrated Zhongxiang engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese defending forces for two days and nights. The Japanese used large amounts of gas and poison gas as threats and bombarded Chinese forces with intense artillery fire. Chinese forces fought bravely and advanced wave after wave. After the positions were destroyed, some troops retreated and defended more advantageous areas. Additionally, Japanese troops that advanced towards Wangjiaji and Changshou Shop have been repelled by Chinese forces. Chinese forces in the Sanyangdian area have made significant progress. Amidst defeat and chaos, the Japanese set fire to civilian houses. Although Japanese forces in Tianmen and Yuekou have slightly increased, they cannot advance due to the Chinese guerrilla forces. Chinese troops launched an offensive on the main front of the Han-Yi Road. A certain unit recaptured the important stronghold of Yangjiadong yesterday and is currently pursuing the enemy in triumph. (Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here this morning, the Chinese and Japanese armies have been engaged in fierce fighting in Zhongxiang for several days, with heavy casualties on both sides. There is talk of Chinese forces shifting positions, but officials have not yet confirmed this. However, Chinese newspapers this morning provide detailed accounts of the intense street fighting in Zhongxiang, stating that Chinese forces have moved to new positions in the western suburbs, preparing to continue the resistance. Furthermore, it is reported that after occupying Zhongxiang, the Japanese will attempt to cross the Hanshui River again. They made such an attempt yesterday, but were unsuccessful. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the war in central Hubei is gradually shifting north. The Japanese have an intention to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng. The fighting in the Zhongxiang area remains fierce. After three days and nights of intense fighting, Chinese forces were finally forced to withdraw from Zhongxiang yesterday due to the destruction of their fortifications. They are now holding the line at Yangzizhen and Fengle River, vigorously resisting Japanese attacks. Japanese forces at Jiukou and Duojiawan have repeatedly attempted to cross the river to attack westward, but have all been repelled by Chinese forces. There was intense artillery fire at Yuekou yesterday, but the Japanese have so far been unable to cross the Hanshui River. (Express News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese forces in central Hubei have encountered strong resistance from Chinese forces on the Jing-Zhong Highway for several consecutive days, suffering heavy casualties. In the struggle for Xiaojiadian alone, Japanese casualties reached thousands. Heavy rain has been incessant in central Hubei for the past week, causing the river to overflow and the roads to become extremely muddy, rendering Japanese mechanized units completely ineffective. This is also one of the reasons for the heavy Japanese casualties. Although some of the important strongholds on the east bank of the Hanshui River have been occupied by the Japanese, the Chinese forces on the west bank are strong and their fortifications are solid. Moreover, the Dabie Mountains in northern Hubei are still under Chinese control. Therefore, it is impossible for the Japanese to cross the river and attack westward at present. After the Japanese forces advancing from Jingshan invaded Zhongxiang, they continued to advance north along the highway, attempting to coordinate with the Japanese forces in the Zhe River area to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng, important towns in northern Hubei. Yesterday, after a Chinese counterattack, they retreated to Zhongxiang. Japanese forces in the Changshou Shop area have repeatedly attempted to advance south to attack the Chinese flanks, but have all been repelled by Chinese forces. (Express News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>The People and Military of Hainan Island Rise Up; Organizing Guerrilla Brigades to Attack Japanese Forces; Heavy Japanese Casualties; Hundreds of Bodies Transported to Haishengang; Japanese Attempt to Invade Dagangling Foiled; Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>Xuwen: The Japanese troops on Hainan Island are intensifying their acts of rape and plunder. The determination of the Chinese soldiers and civilians to fight the enemy together is growing stronger. Able-bodied men from the occupied counties have now formed several guerrilla brigades, cooperating with the isolated army to attack Japanese forces at night, achieving significant results. Japanese casualties are the heaviest in Qiongshan. On the 6th, the Japanese transported over 300 wounded and killed soldiers from Haikou by truck. (Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Xuwen: External news: The American hospital in Haikou, sponsored by American expatriates, has been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army and converted into barracks.

<p>Wengyuan: A portion of the Japanese forces at Shendong, about 300 strong, attacked Dagangling and Mao'erling at 11:00 AM on the 6th. Chinese troops immediately engaged in battle, and the Japanese were unsuccessful. They then used intense artillery fire to cover their infantry's assault. Chinese troops met them head-on with fierce attacks. Both sides charged back and forth, and the battle was fierce. After three hours of intense fighting, Chinese troops, due to the destruction of their positions, moved to [illegible] to hold firm. In this battle, Chinese and Japanese casualties each numbered in the dozens. (Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: Japanese troops in the northern part of Panyu County, due to being attacked by Chinese guerrilla forces everywhere, are prohibiting the residents of the villages around Ya Lake, Bang Lake, and Gaotangjiang from going out in order to block the communication and supply of Chinese guerrilla forces. However, the Chinese guerrilla forces are agile and mobile, and they continue to launch attacks every day, demonstrating that the Japanese are exhausting themselves in vain. (Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: The invading Japanese troops in Guangdong have suffered extremely heavy losses in recent months, especially in terms of firearms. The Japanese troops in Longtanlian, Panyu County, recently organized a self-defense corps, forcing the villagers to join. Each person must have a rifle and 120 rounds of ammunition. The villagers are unwilling to be used by the Japanese and have joined the guerrilla forces to kill the Japanese. (Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese guerrillas in the Dongjiang area are becoming active again. Fierce fighting broke out again yesterday in the suburbs of Shilong, Zengcheng. The Japanese troops, due to their weak forces, have all retreated into the city to defend themselves. The Chinese guerrilla forces in the Beijiang area once again charged into Xinjie the day before yesterday, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops for five hours. Wuyong, southwest of Zengcheng on the Guangshan Highway, was once attacked by Chinese guerrilla forces. (Express News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Heavily Defeated Near Jingle, Northern Shanxi; Fierce Battle Between Two Armies at Beida Wuzhen, Lishi; A Unit of Puppet Troops Mutinies and Defects in Ningwu</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese forces in the upper reaches of the Fen River have achieved another great victory. The troops of General Zhao Chengsui, under General Yan Xishan, have now thwarted the Japanese attempt to press towards Jingle County, northwest of Taiyuan.

It is now reported that guerrilla forces are extremely active in the central and western parts of Shanxi Province. The Japanese offensive has been greatly weakened. (Express News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable Chinese sources, on the 4th of this month, approximately 500 troops from the "Manchukuo" army mutinied near Ningwu, in the northern part of Shanxi Province. It is reported that this "Man" army, while assisting the Japanese forces in attacking Chinese guerrilla forces, was led in a defection by an officer named Zhang Ruisheng (transliteration). They joined forces with the Chinese army to counterattack the Japanese forces. The Japanese forces, caught off guard, retreated in panic and were killed by the "Man" army and the Chinese army, suffering over 200 casualties. (Express News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Xingji: (1) Fierce battles between Chinese and Japanese forces occurred near Beida Wuzhen, Lishi, on the 1st and 2nd. The Japanese forces were ambushed at Yanjia Mountain, west of Dawu, suffering heavy losses and fleeing in disarray.

(2) As of noon on the 2nd, the Japanese forces in Dawu have fortified some of the northeastern villages and have fled to Xidianping, seemingly intending to attack Sanjiao. To assist in annihilating the Japanese forces on the front, a certain Chinese unit launched attacks on Jinluozhen, Lijiawan, and Hejiata from noon on the 2nd, and the fighting continued into the night.

<h3>Xinhua Daily's Commentary: The Terrorist Acts in Shanghai are Caused by the Japanese; In Order to Attack the Public Concession, Not Out of Patriotic Zeal</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to an editorial in the Communist Party's organ, Xinhua Daily, the recent terrorist acts in Shanghai were all committed by the Japanese. The purpose of these actions is to provide the Japanese with an excuse to attack the Public Concession. Chen Lu and Li Guojie both died in the extraterritorial road construction area directly controlled by the Japanese army. The assassins are guards and puppet police from Japanese-run opium dens, brothels, and gambling dens. They parade with weapons in areas under Japanese military control without interference from Japanese military police. This proves that they are mercenaries hired by the Japanese, not Chinese patriots. The atmosphere of terror created by the Japanese's "head policy" is used to make various demands on the Public Concession. The Chinese people of Shanghai know that killing only a few traitors is not of great significance for recovering lost territory and driving the Japanese out of China. The liberation of China cannot be achieved solely through assassination. This goal can only be achieved by organizing the people and uniting the strength of the government and the people.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attacked Pingliang Yesterday; Also Harassed Wuwei and Yongchang; Xi'an Was Also Bombed; Details Under Investigation</h3>
<p>A Certain Location: At 9:50 AM on the 7th, several groups of Japanese aircraft, totaling 45, were spotted in the vicinity of Pucheng, northern Shaanxi, with the intention of invading Lanzhou via Shaanxi and Gansu. By 11:08 AM, only 15 Japanese aircraft had intruded into Pingliang to drop bombs. After 12:00 PM, approximately 30 Japanese aircraft intruded into Wuwei and Yongchang to drop bombs. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, another 14 Japanese aircraft intruded over Xi'an, dropping bombs and fleeing eastward. Details are currently under investigation. (Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan, Caught in a Dilemma, Prepares to Negotiate with the Chinese Government; Declares Itself Not an Omnipotent Country; Even the Communist Party Actually Has Proposals</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma's statement yesterday in the House of Representatives, if General Chiang Kai-shek and the government he leads can reconsider their anti-Japanese attitude and cooperate with Japan to establish a new order in East Asia, then Japan is prepared to negotiate with them to end hostilities. Hiranuma also said that although Japan is prepared to negotiate with the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek to end hostilities, Japan can only regard the Chongqing government as a local government and cannot regard it as the central government of China. He continued that it is necessary to re-establish the "central government" of China from scratch. After the Prime Minister spoke, Foreign Minister Arita continued in the House of Representatives, stating, "We must make the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries aware of Japan's determination to establish a new order in East Asia and to achieve the status of a world power." Arita stated that Japan's foreign policy is based on the Anti-Comintern Pact. The current China Incident is due to the instigation of the Communist International, so Japan must do its utmost to deal with the Communist International. However, Arita concluded by saying that Japan is not an omnipotent country, so there is no need to adopt a hostile policy towards the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries. Judging from the statements of Hiranuma and Arita, it can be seen that Japan is keenly aware of its difficult situation. Both China and the international community have the intention to accommodate the facts. If China continues its resistance, Japan will inevitably have to greatly revise its original plan and abandon its original ambitions. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to today's Pravda, the Japanese Communist Party has drafted a program for the party's work, completely opposing the Japanese government's plans and making various demands regarding domestic and foreign affairs: (1) The Communist Party demands peace with China, without claiming land or military expenses. (2) Withdraw troops stationed in China and "Manchukuo." (3) Abolish the Anti-Comintern Pact. (4) Sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>American Advisor States; The War Will Continue for Three Years; China Will Ultimately Triumph; Japan Will Never Be Able to Conquer China; Occupied Areas Cannot Establish a Government</h3>
<p>(London) Today, Mr. Sivart, an advisor to General Chiang Kai-shek and representative of the American Congregational Church in China, told people here that the war in China will continue for another three years, and as a result China will have the final victory. He said, “The current Sino-Japanese War will continue for at least three years, and then Japan will undoubtedly prepare to negotiate peace. Japan will certainly never be able to conquer China.” Besides the regular army, China also has 2.5 million guerrillas. Japan has only occupied the ports along the coast, but all of these points are completely surrounded by Chinese guerrillas, so trade is actually impossible. Japan is really unable to establish a government in the areas it has occupied. According to Mr. Sivart, who arrived here today from China, he will pass through here on his way back to the United States. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Respectful Greetings to the Women's World</h3>
<p>Today is Women's Day. In extraordinary times, everyone, everything, every moment, and every place should prioritize the most urgent matters. Who still has the leisure and mood, like in previous years, like in ordinary times, to embellish and decorate when a good time or festival arrives? Originally, Women's Day is not just an embellishment for leisure and mood, but has its own profound meaning; but in the midst of the War of Resistance, "military affairs first, victory first, concentrated will, concentrated strength," in comparison, it may be fine to put Women's Day aside and not mention it. However, we especially hope that the women of China will use an extraordinary mood to celebrate this extraordinary Women's Day for the sake of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Chinese women have encountered extraordinary circumstances; not only are they not ashamed of the women of the world, but they have also made extraordinary contributions to the men of China. In terms of general activities: donating money, buying bonds, educating orphaned children, rescuing the wounded, providing relief to compatriots in the rear, and comforting the soldiers on the front lines; as well as all kinds of other work most suitable for women, they are all generous and energetic, and have already achieved remarkable accomplishments. In addition, domestically, there are groups of heroines who can endure hardship, endure hunger and cold, and are not afraid of bullets, traveling thousands of miles, directly serving in the war zone; in several provinces, military training for female recruits is being held, and countless numbers have been trained, honing their skills, and preparing to kill the enemy and achieve success. Abroad, shouting in the streets, running around to promote, gaining international sympathy; especially in the Pacific ports of the United States, not only have they participated in various anti-aggression movements, but they have also organized picket teams centered on overseas Chinese women to effectively prevent the raw materials for manufacturing murder weapons, such as scrap steel and pig iron, from being transported to Japan, and in some places, they have been completely embargoed as a result. All kinds of labors, all kinds of achievements, have almost opened up a new situation of extraordinary work for women around the world, creating a new era of women serving and saving the country! What is even more noteworthy is that all achievements and all accomplishments are by no means the achievements of three or five well-known and outstanding heroines; that is to say, they cannot be attributed to three or five well-known and outstanding heroines: in other words, the majority of women participated, were active, and made significant contributions. This is the supreme glory of the Chinese women's world!</p>
<p>Today is Women's Day. We have praised the majority of Chinese women for participating in extraordinary work and creating great achievements; they are truly working hard to build paradise. At the same time, we sadly commemorate the other majority of Chinese women, who have suffered shame and humiliation and made painful sacrifices; they are truly unfortunate and have fallen into a living hell. Not only that, we also know that there are even more Chinese women who, although living in extraordinary times, are outside the War of Resistance and saving the country; they are either barely surviving in an ignorant universe, or living in a drunken dream in another dark world!</p>
<p>For these even more Chinese women, we should not belittle them for the time being, but should awaken them. At least make them feel the necessity of the War of Resistance. If there is no War of Resistance, not only will they not be able to have the life of a concubine, but they will also be thrown into a living hell, so that they can realize that women are not only people, but also citizens; citizens have the same inescapable responsibility to the country, regardless of gender, so they must cultivate their ability to take on the responsibilities of a citizen, and enable them to understand that women are not only citizens like men, but also the mothers of citizens, so they have the responsibility to educate their children so that they do not feel ashamed to be the next generation of citizens and can take on the responsibilities of the next generation. Enable them to understand that modern society takes the family as the smallest unit of organization, and women are the main cells in each unit; the main cells must have a sound consciousness and ability, and then a sound society can be formed. They must know whether the soundness of women's consciousness and ability is directly expressed in the family they preside over, and whether the soundness of the family is directly controlled by them; but they must further know that the spirit and material of the War of Resistance and saving the country originate from the entire society within the scope of the nation, and that whether this spirit and material are abundant depends on the family as the unit of society, and on the housewives who are the main cells of the family.</p>
<p>Such a statement is by no means an exaggeration. For example, during the War of Resistance, conscription and labor must be promoted; how to promote them depends on the laws of the country, but the attitude of the housewives towards conscription and labor will directly affect their husbands and sons; although we do not say that this influence is more authoritative than national laws, we cannot at least deny that it affects the smooth implementation of laws. Also, for example, during the War of Resistance, the country will inevitably persuade people to donate money, raise bonds, and other levies; in addition to a part that can be enforced by national laws, the other part or most of it must be enthusiastically contributed by the people; whether they are enthusiastic or not depends on the attitude of women and how much material resources they have left over from managing the family. Also, for example, during the War of Resistance, advocating austerity and thrift and discouraging extravagance and waste are important factors in cultivating and maintaining national strength; but the key lies not in the attention of the general society, but in the practical efforts of the housewives in every family.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that women who are barely surviving in an ignorant universe and women who are living in a drunken dream in another dark world are by no means unwilling to love the country, and by no means unwilling to save the country; they mostly think that they are too small, and that their relationship with the country is too distant; they are not belittling themselves, but they do not know themselves. How to awaken them universally? The wise women's world should take more responsibility for this!</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Explain Expansion Plans, Submit Huge Budget to Parliament Yesterday, Army Completes in Five Years, Navy in Six, Aimed at China, Russia, Britain, and the United States</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Army and Navy authorities today submitted a new military expansion budget to the Diet, totaling 1,889,133,000 yen, to be completed in five years. However, the Navy's expansion plan will be completed in six years. The Army's expansion amounts to 194,991,000 yen, of which 13,200,400 yen is for replenishing military equipment, 90,600,000 yen for reorganizing the Army Air Force, and 91,187,000 yen for modernizing military equipment. The Navy's expansion cost reaches 1,694,142,000 yen, to be completed in six years, of which 188,321,000 yen is for supplementing fleet strength, and 300,041,000 yen is for the Navy Air Force. All these supplementary budgets refer to the expenses of various projects that have already begun. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: Navy Minister Yonai recently stated in response to a question from a member of the House of Representatives that the Navy adheres to the principle of a strong naval armament. As for the international resistance arising from the China Incident, the Japanese naval authorities are also considering it. The Navy's preliminary budget for the next fiscal year reaches 172,800,900 yen, of which 60,150,000 yen is for building warships, 56,641,000 yen for reorganizing the naval air force, 25,320,000 yen for naval armaments factories, and 14,500,000 yen for replenishing arsenals. Yonai said that the former American Vinson Naval Armaments Act stipulated that the United States should fully expand its naval armaments to the extent permitted by naval treaties. As for the current Vinson Act, it advocates that the United States Navy's strength should be increased by 20% compared to the treaty provisions. The British Navy's warship expansion cost reaches 100 million pounds. When the Japanese naval authorities formulate a new naval armament plan, the expansion of British and American forces is taken into consideration, aiming for the strongest naval strength in the Pacific, hoping to create the strongest navy. If we can achieve this goal, we must overcome possible international resistance and hope that this resistance can be reduced to a minimum through diplomatic efforts. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Army Minister Itagaki today stated in the House of Representatives his five-year plan to reorganize military equipment worth 200 million yen. This plan is to supplement the inadequacy of the seven-year military equipment replenishment plan passed by the Diet in 1937. The exact amount is 194,896,000 yen, which is scheduled to begin in the next fiscal year. The Army Minister also stated that in order to strengthen the defense of "Manchukuo," the military intends to request the Diet to allocate 368,123,000 yen, of which 79,855,000 yen will be used for "Manchukuo" to establish the Japanese Air Force. As for the use of the five-year plan to reorganize military equipment, it is as follows: (1) 13,204,000 yen for replenishing military equipment, (2) 90,605,000 yen for reorganizing the air force, (3) 91,087,000 yen for modernizing military equipment. The reason why the Army wants to reorganize the air force with huge funds this time is to make the air force under the Army's jurisdiction equal in strength to the air force under the Navy's jurisdiction.

<h3>British New Loan to China Successful Negotiations in London Also Plans to Expand Credit Lending British Parliamentarians Concerned about Far East Affairs</h3>
<p>(London) Negotiations on a plan for British commercial banks and several Chinese banks to jointly participate in a loan to assist Chinese currency have been underway for several weeks. This enterprise will include a huge amount of money, and it is generally believed that it is in the common interest of both parties. It is reported that the technical measures of this plan have made great progress and will be announced in the Parliament this week. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Rodgers, a senior official of the Bank of England, is negotiating with Chinese representatives to lend China 3 to 5 million gold pounds, guaranteed by the British government, to improve China's financial situation, which has been affected by the Japanese seizing a part of its tax revenue. According to reports, Rodgers accompanied Sir Leith-Ross, the government's chief economic advisor, to China in 1934, and recently toured China again, returning to London three weeks ago.

<p>(London) According to official sources here today, in order to support Chinese legal tender and use China to purchase railway tracks, machinery, tools, and other British goods, Britain has decided to make two more large loans to China. The amount of the first loan is approximately between 3 and 5 million pounds, and the purpose is to support Chinese legal tender. This loan is undertaken by the HSBC and other British banks. It is heard that a resolution to approve this loan will be submitted to the Parliament soon. According to government sources, the main purposes of this loan to China are twofold: (1) To show the consistency of British and American actions in the Far East, because the amount of this British loan to China is almost equal to the amount of the American loan to China. (2) To put pressure on the Japanese side to change its ambition to dominate the Pacific. As for the second batch, it is an expansion of credit lending for exports to China. The established credit lending is 500,000 pounds. The British side now intends to increase this lending tenfold so that China can purchase British railway materials, machinery, tools, and papermaking machines. (6th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Blocking the Pearl River Further Negotiations Submitted</h3>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from opposition Liberal Party MP Harris that the British government has negotiated with the Japanese government regarding the blockade of the Pearl River, but has not negotiated regarding the occupation of the Guangzhou Delta. Foreign Secretary Halifax understands the opinions of the British Chamber of Commerce in Guangzhou and is well aware of the impact of the continued existence of the current restrictive measures on the general interests of the British people. Harris also asked if Butler knew the importance of this matter and the impact on Lancashire. Butler replied that he was well aware of it, which is why he said that the British government is continuing to urge the early restoration of Pearl River navigation.</p>
<h3>Protecting Commercial Interests in North China</h3>
<p>Conservative Party member Moreing asked Butler whether he was aware of the announcement issued by French, Italian, and Japanese officials on March 10 that all commercial transactions in North China must use banknotes from the United Reserve Bank. He also asked whether Butler would take measures to ban the import of goods from North China into British and British colonial ports unless they had a consular certificate proving that they were financially facilitated by British, American, and French banks, in order to resist Japanese discrimination. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware of this announcement. As for the second question, the British government will consider various practical ways to protect British interests. Moreing said that what is needed now is action, not consideration. Butler replied that he would not neglect the need to take any necessary action.</p>
<h3>Safety of British Nationals in Yichang</h3>
<p>Conservative Party member Marsden asked whether there was a British consul in Yichang now. If not, could the British government immediately send a consul there to protect British interests, because the Japanese army is now planning to attack Yichang. Butler replied that there was no British consul in Yichang now, but there was a British warship. The British government can rely on the captain of the warship to take the necessary measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals. If the environment requires the presence of consular personnel, Chongqing can send someone at any time. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Local Financial Conference Minister of Finance Kong's Instructions Personnel Should Be Responsible for Supporting Local Production Undertakings Financial Institutions Should Strive to Assist Close Cooperation Between Central and Local Governments</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The full text of Minister Kong's instructions at the Second Local Financial Conference is as follows: Today, the Ministry of Finance has invited you to hold a symposium in Chongqing. You have come from afar, and your hard work is known. In order to adjust local finance and strengthen the war of resistance, the Ministry of Finance has held a conference and decided on many important cases, which have been quite successful in implementation. It has been more than eight months since then. During this period, the first phase of the war of resistance has just ended, and the second phase is beginning. The overall situation of the war of resistance has already had an important key. Regarding local finance, we should carefully review and make further efforts to coordinate with the military operations. The position of provincial banks and local banks is the key to promoting local finance, and they bear very important responsibilities. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance invites you here to talk, on the one hand, to understand the current financial situation in various places, and on the other hand, to propose several important issues and study and discuss them in detail with you. You are all the highest responsible persons of local financial institutions, and you must have very good opinions for reference and adoption. It is expected that the results of this discussion will also have satisfactory gains in the future. However, given the importance of local financial matters today, how to deliberate and handle the planning and promotion, I have some opinions and would like to take this opportunity to contribute to you. (1) The issue of responsibility: It is found that the current provincial and local banks, whether they are within the war zone or close to the war zone, inevitably encounter difficulties and setbacks in the progress of affairs due to environmental and factual reasons. However, this kind of difficulty is impossible and should not be avoided. In the future, personnel of local financial institutions, regardless of their position, must always recognize their own position and the importance of responsibility. They must never perfunctorily deal with what should be done. They must move forward with a spirit of sacrifice, not afraid of difficulties or hardship. For example, branches of local banks within the war zone should continue their daily operations as usual and should not withdraw before the troops withdraw. Also, if there are no branches in the location of the war zone headquarters, branches should be added to facilitate war zone finance. This kind of area is not a very safe place, but it is the responsibility, of course, there is no reason to avoid it. For example, the central government now stipulates that within the war zone, the four branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank should be the last to withdraw with the troops, and in the location of the war zone headquarters, one of the four banks should set up a branch to provide services as usual. It is hoped that the provincial and local banks should also do the same, so that there will be no stagnation in wartime finance. (2) In order to support local production undertakings and resist the economic invasion of the enemy and puppets, how to develop production undertakings, how to purchase important material raw materials, how to use provincial banknotes to circulate deeply in guerrilla areas to resist the circulation of enemy and puppet banknotes, how to collect information on enemy economic invasion, and how to use financial power to support the soundness of local finances, the above are all important issues and should be considered according to the circumstances, with quick procedures, and gradually improved and implemented. (3) Local financial institutions should effectively assist and cooperate to achieve thorough results. If they still deal with things perfunctorily and shirk their responsibilities, not only will the war of resistance be affected, but also the local economic situation will not be improved. In the past, the provincial and local banks in various provinces have made good achievements in assisting in promoting the legal tender policy, redeeming gold and silver, and promoting small-denomination banknotes. In the future, it is hoped that they will make even greater efforts and purchase materials, agricultural products, and mineral products on behalf of the central government, open national construction savings, and practice economy. All matters must be jointly committed by the central and local governments, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. (4) The issue of cooperation between central and local banks and provincial and local banks: The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank should cooperate closely and help each other with local banks, such as purchasing materials, developing production, handling agricultural loans, rediscounting, and receiving banknotes. There are also many things that provincial local banks can cooperate with each other. In short, it is necessary to form a sound financial network connecting the provinces with the central government and the provinces with each other. The institutions should be integrated, and the breathing should be connected, so that the national finance can achieve the effect of overall adjustment. The above four points are quite simple. I hope that you will be responsible and cooperate with each other to cope with the current difficulties. If you have any opinions, I hope you will raise them for discussion as much as possible. With everyone's detailed research, there will be satisfactory results. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Finance Minister and Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi addressed the National Financial Conference, urging Chinese banks to cooperate with military authorities in the war zone. Kong also said that local banks must operate as usual, and banks must not withdraw when the troops have not withdrawn. Banks should set up branches in the place where the commander-in-chief of the war zone has established a headquarters, so as to facilitate the circulation of provincial banknotes in the guerrilla area. This move will not only assist the guerrillas in fighting in these areas, but also prevent the Japanese from spreading the circulation of counterfeit banknotes. Kong urged all local banks to assist the Chinese government in carrying out its financial and economic procedures. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Glimmer of Peace in Spain Miaja Forms New Cabinet Party, Government, and Military Leaders All Express Support Ceasefire Negotiations are Underway in Secret</h3>

<p>Madrid Ending the Spanish Civil War is becoming more urgent tonight, due to the repulsion of most of the government's fleet and rumors that the Madrid Defense Committee has been holding peace talks with the rebel government under Franco's leadership. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Spanish Civil War is likely to come to an end. The most popular reports among French people here are that General Casado, the Minister of Defense of the Defense Committee, has made a peace proposal to General Franco in Burgos. It is said that this proposal is based on the basis of freedom, independence, and reconciliation. It is also said that the government army hopes that the rebel leaders will be able to raise a glorious peace proposal in their reply, especially allowing "Spain to gain freedom from foreign countries and allies." (6th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Spanish Parliament Speaker Barrio remains in France today. He hinted today that Nationalist leader General Franco and the Republican army will soon compromise. According to Barrio, Republican Army Commander General Miaja is "the person who can compromise with General Franco and make Spain regain peace." Barrio mentioned the new Defense Council and said that he was sure that the council fully agreed on the issue of stopping the war. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid After General Miaja formed a new cabinet, the Air Force under the Republican Army issued a declaration expressing its absolute support and unconditional obedience. (7th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid The leaders of the front-line troops in Madrid all arrived at the general headquarters this morning to assist the National Defense Council. General Casado, who is responsible for the establishment of this council, has received the approval of the heads of all military regions, civil administrations, and political parties by telephone, except for the Communist Party. The Negrín Cabinet has now resigned, and some former cabinet members are now coming here. If the National Defense Council needs and accepts their cooperation, they will assist. According to reports from civil administrations, everything is peaceful in all provinces under their jurisdiction. Today, several Communist Party centers in Madrid have had cordon lines set up around them to prevent unauthorized persons from approaching or entering. The public here has expressed their support for the new committee. The city is also peaceful, with six-inch light cannons and machine guns erected at street corner intersections. The troops are also guarding the barracks, but there is no sign of rebellion, turmoil, or opposition. Public affairs are as usual. The people of Madrid are now wondering what steps will be taken next, because they believe that the possibility of ending the civil war without bloodshed is far from the distant future when former Prime Minister Negrín was in power.

<h3>Casado Issues Letter to Frontline Soldiers Earnestly Appeals for a Glorious Peace to Maintain the Freedom and Independence of the Motherland</h3>
<p>Madrid General Casado, the leader of the newly formed National Defense Council, issued a declaration to the Spanish soldiers in the trenches, earnestly appealing for peace to maintain the independence of Spain. It stated that the die has been cast, and everything depends on us to seek a way out of the deadlock with our own will. The Spaniards must now choose between purposeful freedom and destructive slavery, and between peace that is beneficial to Spain and a war that is a lackey of crazy imperialism. Our struggle must end when the independence and security of Spain are guaranteed. The Spanish people will never lay down their arms until they have obtained a guarantee of innocent peace. General Casado is now speaking on behalf of millions of people who are willing to fight to the death to preserve the independence of Spain, so as to avoid our country from falling into the ocean of red blood, hatred, and persecution, and to seek a free Spain for future generations, free from the tyranny of foreign nightmares. The declaration concludes: If you offer us peace, you will see that we have the chivalrous hearts of Spaniards. If you continue to fight against the doctors, you will see that we have deep vigilance, great hatred, and self-confidence, as tenacious as a sharp steel sword. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Terms Still No More Than Three Points Amnesty Is Not Hopeless</h3>
<p>Madrid The attitude of the Defense Council hereafter may not be very different from that of the former government. In other words, it should still negotiate peace with the Nationalist government and not allow unconditional surrender. As for the basis of the negotiations, it is still no more than three points: (1) Foreign combatants withdraw from Spain, (2) The Nationalist government promulgates an amnesty decree, (3) A referendum is held to determine the future political system. Among the people of the Republican government, the second point is the most important because they fear large-scale retaliation from the Nationalist government. Regarding this, General Franco's remarks to the British Sunday Chronicle the other day seemed to have been more tactful, and the recent broadcast messages from the Nationalist radio station have also mentioned the issue of amnesty, which shows that the future is not hopeless. (6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Burgos Today, it is extremely difficult to understand the meaning of the bizarre developments in the Spanish Republican army area. Although the nature of the newly established Defense Council has shown the expulsion of communist elements, the broadcast remarks made by its leaders still seem to have the intention to continue the war if the Nationalist army firmly refuses to give surrender conditions. The leaders of the new Defense Council, Casado and Miaja, are both military men and should know that the war of resistance is bound to fail. Therefore, according to the opinions of people here, the organization of the Defense Council is just a mechanism for formulating the final surrender plan, and it is believed that the trend in Madrid is now between anarchy and orderly surrender. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) "The Daily Mail" reported that "General Miaja and General Casado have sent personnel to contact General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, to explore the possibility of establishing peace, saying that the power of the Communist Party has been eliminated and the remaining Republican government has been fundamentally abolished." However, it is heard that General Franco's intention is that after the ceasefire between the two sides, both General Miaja and General Casado should go abroad, which is the main difficulty at present.

<h3>Western Republic Government: The Cause and Effect of the Coup d'état – An Act Actually Containing Anti-Communist Sentiments; Negrín Flees to France in Haste for Switzerland</h3>
<p>(Paris) The downfall of the Negrín cabinet of the Spanish Republican Government was long expected by diplomatic circles here and is not surprising. Since the Spanish President Azaña had already resigned and the parliament was unable to convene the legal number of members, it was impossible for the Negrín cabinet to exercise executive power in accordance with the constitution. In addition, former Prime Minister Negrín's prestige plummeted after the loss of Catalonia. On the 4th of this month, he decided to place the government forces under his personal command, effectively establishing a dictatorial regime, and appointed communists to important military positions, which led to the coup. For example, the mutiny of a part of the garrison in the port of Cartagena was caused by the appointment of the communist Colonel Rodríguez as the commander of the fortress in that port. On the contrary, the reputation of General Casado, the interim chairman of the National Defense Council, grew daily. Before the coup, he was in charge of leadership in Madrid, and no one was better suited for the role. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>Madrid After the establishment of the "National Government," the city is very peaceful. Although some communists wanted to cause disturbances, they failed due to the authorities' careful prevention. There are two distinctive features of this coup that must be mentioned: first, all parties and factions are united to resist foreign ideologies; second, all parties and factions want to establish peace talks with the National Military Government under honorable conditions. Now, the authorities of the provinces under the jurisdiction of the government forces and the military leaders have all come forward to respond, so there is no fear of reaction. According to informed sources, this matter has been brewing for some time and has an anti-communist nature. As late as the 12th of last month, when the cabinet members of the Republican government returned to Madrid from France, the left-wing Republicans took the lead in expressing their opposition to the Negrín cabinet. At that time, the parties could be roughly divided into three factions: (1) The left-wing Republicans, i.e., the moderates, planned to urge President Azaña to return to the country to preside over the government and dissolve the Negrín cabinet. (2) The Socialist General Labor Union and the Anarchist Labor Federation advocated respecting the constitution. (3) The Communist Party unconditionally supported the Negrín cabinet and disregarded the constitution. At that time, eight of the twelve cabinet members disagreed with Prime Minister Negrín. Until the 17th of last month, all parties and factions jointly issued a statement condemning the actions of the Communist Party and refusing to cooperate with them. Unexpectedly, Prime Minister Negrín stubbornly refused to change his mind and appointed Communist Party members to important military positions. At this point, all parties and factions could no longer tolerate it and, under the leadership of General Casado and Besteriro, jointly overthrew the Negrín cabinet and replaced it with the National Defense Council. Former Prime Minister Negrín and other important figures also boarded planes and fled to France in haste. (Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>

The French authorities have warned them that they must not engage in political activities while in France. Negrín said that he has given up his Spanish political positions and is traveling in a private capacity. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<h3>Czech President Seeks to Curb Pan-Ukrainian Movement; Reorganization of the Autonomous Government of Ukraine Province; Czech Republic and Poland Maintain Old Friendship</h3>
<p>Prague President Hácha recently dismissed Levan, the Minister of Transportation of the Autonomous Province of Carpathian Ukraine, and ordered the reorganization of the provincial government, with former Prime Minister Volosin as Prime Minister and Minister of Justice and Education, Borscana as Minister of Interior and Finance and Transportation, and Klogulak as Minister of Commerce and Agriculture, Public Works, and Social Welfare. Informed sources here recently commented that President Hácha's actions are intended to curb the Pan-Ukrainian movement and consolidate the position of the Czech people. This can be seen from the dismissal of Transportation Minister Levan (the leader of the Pan-Ukrainian movement) and the succession of the Czech Borscana to his post. Political figures here say that in addition to maintaining friendship with Germany, the Czech Republic also wants to maintain good neighborly relations with Poland, because there is also a Pan-Ukrainian movement within Poland, so as to jointly curb this movement.

The authorities are keeping secret who possessed the document, only knowing that the person drove to Cavendish Square, stopped briefly, and left the car. When he returned to the car, the document was gone. This happened in an instant. There was more than one suitcase in the car, but the thief was able to choose the leather suitcase containing the document, which shows that the person had been coveting it for a long time. After the incident, the police authorities have been conducting a thorough investigation, but have not yet obtained any leads. (Havas dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Naval Warfare Director Leahy spoke to the Senate Naval Committee today, reiterating the Navy Department's desire for Congress to approve its plan to construct defensive fortifications on Guam Island, saying that the island's strategic position makes it an invaluable defense base that can effectively deter any foreign hostile actions against Hawaii or the US mainland. Guam Island's terrain is extremely strategic, and aircraft and submarines can use it as a base to protect American overseas trade from the Dutch East Indies. It is especially appropriate for the United States to use Guam Island as a US naval station after withdrawing from the Philippines in 1945. Those who oppose this plan are actually based on the mistaken notion that strong defensive measures are currently easy to arouse suspicion. Leahy said that this plan, as mentioned before, involves the construction of new seawalls and the improvement of aircraft facilities. The procedure for the island's defensive fortifications has been submitted to the Senate for approval in a 650 million dollar bill to improve naval aircraft facilities in several islands, including those in the Central Pacific. This bill is the same as the 470 million dollar Air Force base bill recently passed by the House of Representatives, except that the House of Representatives deleted the clause in the bill that stipulated the development of Guam Island.

<h3>Former French Foreign Minister Writes an Article Criticizing Japan's Occupation of Hainan Island; If Britain, France, and the United States Cannot Agree, When Can We Hope for Their Unity?</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Brussels, Belgium dispatch Former French Foreign Minister Daladier recently wrote an article in a local evening paper criticizing Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, stating: Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, although ostensibly a military measure against China, is actually a demonstration to Britain, the United States, and France. This is the result of the failure of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is hoped that Britain, the United States, and France will quickly unite to seek countermeasures. If the countries cannot unite on such an obvious matter of equal obligations and interests, when can we hope for their unity? (Dispatch of the 6th)</p>

<h3>Silver Shipped to America Safely Arrives in the Philippines</h3>
<p>(Manila) A small French coastal steamer carrying 400 tons of Chinese silver and gold destined for the United States successfully passed through the Japanese blockade line and arrived here today. It is reported that the Eastern Huili Bank shipped this gold and silver. This gold and silver will be transferred to the President Cleveland, which will set sail from Manila on March 9 for Hong Kong and then to San Francisco.

<h3>Britain and Japan Sign an Agreement to Resume Navigation Between Canton and Hong Kong; Little Benefit to British Trade, Only Passengers Carried Temporarily, No Goods</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent Since the fall of Guangzhou, the traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been completely cut off. For several months, the commercial losses suffered by Britain have been enormous. Hong Kong is the only base for British trade with South China, and Guangzhou is the only gateway for foreign goods to enter South China. Now that the traffic between Hong Kong and Guangzhou has been cut off by the Japanese army, British goods cannot be imported into South China. Therefore, since October of last year, the trade volume in Hong Kong has been greatly reduced. Goods shipped to Hong Kong by various foreign firms are stored in warehouses, business is stagnant, and everyone is complaining. The British authorities have repeatedly protested against the Japanese army's cutting off of navigation between Guangdong and Hong Kong and blockading the Pearl River. However, the Japanese army's offensive in South China, another purpose of which is to plunder Britain's market in South China and cut off the connection between Hong Kong and the inland areas of Guangdong Province, has always perfunctorily dealt with the British protests. On the one hand, it uses military transport to load a large number of Japanese goods and transport them to the occupied areas for dumping, in order to fulfill its long-standing wish to seize the British market and replace it. In January of this year, people in the Hong Kong shipping industry circulated rumors that traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong would soon be restored. At that time, the Kinshan vessel once went to Guangzhou for a trial run, but afterwards there was no news. The Kinshan vessel was docked at the Hong Kong wharf, still silent. Until last week, the Kinshan vessel set sail again to Guangzhou, and one day a Japanese vessel sailed from Hong Kong to Guangdong, carrying ordinary passengers, but not cargo. At this time, people in the shipping industry leaked the news again, saying that the British and Japanese sides had formally signed an agreement on the resumption of navigation between Guangdong and Hong Kong. According to the reporter's investigation, it was learned that the signing of this agreement was indeed a fact. The place where the agreement was signed was in Guangzhou. The British side who signed the treaty was the Consul General stationed in Shamian, Guangzhou, and the Japanese side was also the Consul General stationed in Guangzhou. The content is strictly confidential, and outsiders do not know it. However, regarding the permanent navigation of ships between Guangdong and Hong Kong, the agreement stipulates that British vessels may sail from Hong Kong to Guangzhou once every two weeks, while Japanese vessels may sail from Hong Kong to Guangdong once every week. Whether it is a British vessel or a Japanese vessel, when going to Guangdong and coming to Hong Kong, it is only allowed to carry passengers with a small amount of luggage, and it is not allowed to carry cargo. In fact, although Guangdong and Hong Kong have been opened to navigation, there is still no benefit to British commerce. Japanese merchant ships can come and go like British ships, and they travel twice as often as British ships. The British side is probably just relieved that it is better than nothing. It is said that the British side made such a huge concession on the resumption of traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong because it had no choice. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou and cut off navigation on the Pearl River, Britain immediately made a serious protest to Japan, demanding the complete opening of the Pearl River. The Japanese side refused on the one hand, and on the other hand, it expressed friendship to the Portuguese government of Macau. The two sides repeatedly negotiated the construction of a railway from Guangzhou to Macau, so that Guangzhou and other parts of Guangdong Province under Japanese occupation would have another trading port. Once this news came out, the British attitude became moderate. On the one hand, it tried its best to promote the partial opening of the Pearl River, and on the other hand, it made concessions to allow Japanese ships to travel between Guangdong and Hong Kong. Although the British side suffered considerable losses, it was also forced by the situation.</p>
<h3>Bishop Yu Bin Promotes Aid to China and Disaster Relief in the United States; Holds a 100-Ambulance Movement</h3>
<p>Washington News Bishop Yu Bin arrived in the United States capital on the 13th of last month, had lunch with the Pope's representative to the United States, and met with a group of reporters at the Chinese Embassy, ​​publishing a major written speech, correcting the false claims made by the Japanese in international propaganda that China was being communist. After Bishop Yu left the United States last year, the Japanese dispatched special officials to the United States to sabotage Bishop Yu's work, spread rumors of an "anti-communist" war, and agitated the emotions of American isolationists in an attempt to oppose the US government's aid to China and sanctions against Japan. Over the past year, the Japanese conspiracy has been quite effective. Therefore, after Bishop Yu arrived in the United States, he strongly refuted the Japanese conspiracy, so that the American people understood that China's war of resistance was not only for survival, but also for humanity and justice. The Japanese fallacy of an "anti-communist war" is like Hitler and Mussolini advocating "anti-communism" while actually overthrowing democratic politics, expanding territory, and carrying out their policy of aggression. After Bishop Yu arrived in New York, various overseas Chinese organizations asked him to give speeches. He had extremely accurate analyses of China's military, diplomatic, political, economic, and financial aspects since the War of Resistance, and used objective facts to prove that China would win in the end. The original manuscript has been published in various American newspapers, and the patriotic sentiment of overseas Chinese has increased day by day. On the Lunar New Year's Day "February 19," overseas Chinese in New York, under the leadership of Bishop Yu, held a "100-Ambulance Movement Rally." After Bishop Yu's speech, more than 10,000 people participated in the parade. After the parade, more than 20,000 US dollars were raised within four hours, creating an unprecedented feat. In addition to contacting organizations related to China and fundraising, Bishop Yu also visited influential leaders in the American government and the public, such as US President Roosevelt, American Red Cross President Davis, and Columbia University President Dr. Butler, all of whom have been met. He plans to go to major cities to promote the movement to aid China and provide disaster relief in the future.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Eastern Travelogue (5)</p>
<h3>Water Transport Hub, Commercial Center: Lanxi, Over Half of the County's Conscripts Trained, Flower Boat Women Eagerly Participate in Training</h3>
<p>From Jinhua to Lanxi, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has the Jin-Lan branch line, which can be reached in only about an hour. Lanxi used to belong to Jinhua Prefecture, but the prefecture was abolished and became a county after the Republic of China. By the autumn of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Government designated it as an experimental county. After several years of hard work, the townships in Lanxi County have good organization and order. Lanxi is a large city with hundreds of thousands of people. In addition to the county seat, Youbu, Zhuge, Yongchang, Nubu and other places are very lively towns. Moreover, the towns and the county seat are connected by highways and automobiles, making it an important place in eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Establishment of Alcohol Factory</p>
<p>Lanxi is the central hub of the Wu (Jinhua), Qu (Quzhou), and Yong (Ningbo) ports. The county seat is located at the junction of the three ports. Therefore, Zhejiang's commerce is centered on Ningbo in the coastal area, Hangzhou in the inland, and Lanxi is the center for freight transport in the canal area of eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, today's Lanxi is not only an important hub for water transport due to the wartime environment, but also a gathering place for commerce in eastern Zhejiang, which is becoming more prosperous. Lanxi County's agricultural products amount to more than 2.6 million dan per year, with sugarcane as the main specialty, producing about 160,000 dan per year. Handicrafts are very developed, including papermaking, oil pressing, tobacco, sugar, ham, and livestock. In terms of industry, there are also several factories. Recently, people from Jinhua and Lanxi jointly established an alcohol factory. It is said that the quality of the products is excellent. This emerging wartime industry should also be valued by us.</p>
<p>Women's Mobilization</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the local people is no less than that of other places. In terms of society, the County Party Department and People's Education Center have established national salvation organizations in various towns, encouraging residents of various towns to actively donate money to save the country. When the reporter asked at the People's Education Center, it was said that since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, they have actively organized the local people and began to guide residents in the urban area on air raid and poison gas prevention and first aid methods. Now, they are still carrying out plans to organize the people, hoping that every Lanxi person can have sufficient wartime knowledge and national salvation ideas. At the same time, women are also quite organized. In addition to women's first aid classes, they also plan to train the flower boat women of Lanxi, because there are many flower boats on the banks of the Lanxi River. According to a recent survey by the county government, there are twenty-one flower boats in the urban area, with ninety women, mostly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one. However, among these ninety flower boat women, only nine can read, and only eight have some embroidery skills. The rest are illiterate and have no skills. Moreover, these flower boat women are mostly idle, so there are plans to actively train them so that they can also serve the country. Secondly, in the northwest Chenglong area of Lanxi (including Shangxi Lower Street Yiqian Beijin Street Lower Chang Street, etc.), there are eighty-nine tea houses, which employ tea girls to serve tea customers, totaling one hundred and thirty-two tea girls. Most of these tea girls are between the ages of seventeen and nineteen, so they are also taught first aid knowledge to serve the country. At the same time, most of the flower boat women and tea girls are very willing to receive this training. This spirit is indeed worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Visiting Yongchang</p>
<p>Lanxi has a night market, which is very lively in places like West Main Street. Several newly opened foreign goods stores use neon lights for their signs. Even at night, the streets are still crowded with people. When the reporter passed the city tower, which housed a public library, he went up to visit. Many people were reading, and there were many newspapers from various places. On the bookshelves, there were several newly published magazines. Lanxi also has its own newspaper, which is similar in content and format to the Jinsheng Daily of Jinhua. According to statistics, Lanxi County has 52,235 people. In the county's ninety-three townships, they are divided into districts for training. "Yongchang is an important town in Lanxi," the reporter crossed the river and took a highway bus to visit it. The journey took about sixty minutes. After getting off the bus, there was a winding country road, and further in was a lively cross street. The city appearance was quite neat, with large shops on both sides. On the street, I found the town government office and went in to visit. According to the local town head, "The rules for conscripting men in this town are very strict. Regardless of rich or poor households, all those of conscription age must be sent for training. They cannot pay for substitutes or deliberately shirk. At this time of national hardship, we cadres must not be casual, otherwise, we will be sorry to the country. A large number of conscripts in this town have been trained. As for the people's ideas of saving the country in the town are very high, so they are very willing to donate money to raise public bonds." In an inland township, such a spirit is also worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Impressions of This Trip</p>
<p>In summary, this simple outline is very sufficient to show that today's eastern Zhejiang, although in the military rear, its entire organization still maintains a very sound structure. The economy, politics, and public organization of various places are all on the road to progress. We know that in order to obtain the final victory, we need a solid front line and a stable rear. The soundness of social organizations and the intensity of public sentiment in various places in the rear of China today are clear symbols of obtaining the final victory. (End)</p>
<h3>Special Products of Fujian Province Temporarily Allowed to be Transported to Shanghai, Regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The main products of Fujian Province are wood, tea, paper, and bamboo. The prosperity and decline of the province's economy depends entirely on the smooth sale of these four special products. Since the outbreak of the war, wood and bamboo have been very popular in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai, while tea and paper have been very popular in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Dalian. In particular, the fir business has been the most developed. In the past year, more than thirty new machine sawmills have been established in Fuzhou, with no less than ten thousand sawmill workers. Even the timber logs felled in the upper reaches of the Min River are not enough for the sawmills in Fuzhou to cut. The sawn timber boards from the factories in Fuzhou are not enough for export. According to timber merchants, these exported timber boards are all used for the reconstruction of houses destroyed by the war in the northern and southern guerrilla areas. Recently, due to orders prohibiting the export of wood, tea, paper, and bamboo from February 1, the four business groups are very panicked. Led by the Chamber of Commerce, they sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Provincial Government, appealing for a change in the method and temporarily allowing exports to maintain the local economy. The sawmills immediately announced a shutdown from February 1, and all sawmill workers were unemployed. The timber rafts stranded in the upper reaches of the Min River dared not sail downstream, reaching more than 3 million yuan. The commercial economy suffered a blow, and it was suddenly hindered. On the 18th, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the bamboo, wood, tea, and paper products from Fujian could be transported to the Shanghai concession area. Before the examination and approval procedures for the ban on the transportation of materials to the enemy to Shanghai are determined, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce or the Chamber of Commerce at the place of origin, and the relevant industry trade associations, shall issue a certificate guaranteeing that the items will not be used to aid the enemy. The reporting merchant shall submit the certificate to the Customs for verification and release. The County Chamber of Commerce immediately notified the wood, tea, paper, and bamboo trade associations to comply. Timber merchants said that Tianjin and Shanghai each account for half of the sales. Although Shanghai is now allowed to start shipping, Tianjin is still prohibited. Therefore, it is still temporarily unable to fully resume operations. However, the timber rafts stranded in the upper reaches of the Min River have been approved by the Min Customs and the Department of Finance to record the various taxes first and transport them to Fuzhou for sawing, and then make up the payment when exporting, to show consideration. The tea and paper merchants have jointly launched a joint venture company to prepare for sales to neighboring provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang to make up for the losses.</p>
<h3>Trade Association in Ningbo Purchases Local Products</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Ningbo Branch of the Trade Committee of the Ministry of Finance has recently stated that since the Zhejiang Customs announced a ban on the transportation of local products from eastern Zhejiang that can be easily exchanged for foreign exchange to Shanghai, most of them have been stranded in Ningbo and cannot be shipped as scheduled. Now, in order to help farmers and merchants and increase foreign exchange, the branch has submitted a report to the General Assembly for approval and will begin purchasing. Yesterday, the branch sent a document to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, instructing relevant merchants to register with the branch first, and then purchase at a price.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Attacked Changshu in Fierce Battle at Phoenix Mountain</h3>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: The national salvation army, composed of over two thousand men from the Yuan and Guo armies active in the Yu (Yu county) and Cheng (Jiangyin county) areas, stormed into the western suburbs of Changshu at dawn on the 3rd. The Changshu Japanese garrison hastily fought back, lasting eight hours and gradually showing signs of collapse. Later, the Hirose unit of the Japanese army from Suzhou reinforced them, and the two sides fought fiercely again in the Phoenix Mountain area. The Japanese army suffered about a hundred casualties, while the Chinese side also suffered some losses.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Review of Popular Reading Materials in the Past Two Years, Editing Standards Divided into Three Categories, Increased Compilation of Wartime Popular Reading Materials, 170 Approved</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education's review of popular reading materials in the past two years, according to the Central Administration Director of the Ministry, Mr. Chen Lijiang, is as follows:</p>
<p>Editing Standards: The Ministry of Education considers popular reading materials as an important tool for implementing social education. Since December 1936, it has begun to work on planned editing and reviewing. At that time, it formulated several important items for the editing of popular reading materials as follows: (1) The purpose of editing is to enable people who have received basic education (graduates of public schools) to continue their education from a wide range of simple and interesting reading materials, so as to (a) develop national consciousness, (b) cultivate national morality, (c) instill scientific knowledge, (d) increase practical knowledge. (2) Editing principles: (a) Content: (i) At least one of the editing purposes must be met; (ii) It is sufficient to arouse the enthusiasm of the people to strive for progress, and there is no negative, pessimistic, romantic, solitary, timid, etc. effect; (b) Form: (i) The writing must be popular, upright, and vivid; (ii) The words used must be based on commonly used words by the people. Only when it is unavoidable, uncommon words should not be used; (iii) Punctuation marks must be added; (iv) Each volume should be 8,000 to 15,000 words, but dramas, songs, drum books, ditties, etc. are not subject to this limit. (3) Types of reading materials are divided into three types: (a) Popular Knowledge Library, for supplementing the knowledge of the people, including Party ideology, society, nature, self-cultivation, and application. It is written in simple vernacular and can be interspersed with pictures; (b) Comic strips, for imparting knowledge to the people who are not very literate. The content is divided into categories similar to the Popular Knowledge Library. It is written in clear and vivid books, and the inserted text should be shallow and concise; (c) Popular Literature, for providing the people with leisure reading, with the purpose of cultivating the mind and stimulating national consciousness. All ancient and modern celebrities' good words and deeds, patriotic historical facts, and folk legends can be selected as topics. Regardless of whether the content is one person or several people's facts, or part of their facts, as long as they meet the purpose, they can be freely adopted. The title of the book is self-proposed, and the editing style can be freely adopted, regardless of novels, stories, dramas (Peking Opera, Kun Opera, spoken drama), drum books, songs (folk songs, Taoist rhymes, lotus flowers), dittyies (Wugengtian, Twelve Months of Flowers, etc.) can be adopted. (4) Editing method: In addition to the Ministry of Education editing itself, and collecting existing reading materials, reviewing and revising them, the above various types can also be made public to solicit contributions. In addition to popular literature, applicants can self-propose book titles and edit them. For the other two types, they can select one or several types according to the book titles proposed by the Ministry of Education, but other good works are also welcome. Cash will be paid for all submissions.</p>
<p>Review Process: In the past two years, in accordance with the above-mentioned important items for editing and proposed book titles, the Ministry has engaged in reviewing and editing. In the Knowledge Library, it has obtained 97 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 55 have been reviewed and adopted. In comic strips, in addition to reviewing hundreds of types popular on the market, it has obtained 28 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 13 have been reviewed and adopted. In popular literature, in addition to reviewing the old reading materials popular on the market, it has obtained 3 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 8 have been reviewed and adopted. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the whole country rose up. The Ministry of Education, urgently needed, added a category of wartime popular reading materials to stimulate national consciousness, strengthen the will to resist Japan, and supplement wartime knowledge. From September 1937 to the most recent, it has obtained 45 self-edited manuscripts. After April 1938, it also designated a number of teachers from specialized schools and above in the registered war zone to temporarily undertake the editing and reviewing of popular reading materials, totaling 45 types of popular knowledge library and 4 types of comic strips. In total, in the past two years, in addition to purchasing popular reading materials on the market for review, it has obtained 232 self-edited and solicited manuscripts, of which 170 have been reviewed and adopted.</p>
<p>When the above manuscripts are completed, printing will be carried out at the same time. Initially, when the Ministry of Education was in Nanjing, it was agreed that Shanghai Beixin and Guangyi Bookstores would be responsible for printing separately. Unexpectedly, during the fierce battle in Shanghai, the two bookstores had difficulties in their work. Not only was there no hope of publishing books, but also part of the original manuscripts were lost as a result. Therefore, Zhenzhong Bookstore was re-assigned to undertake the printing. As of recently, 40 types of wartime popular series have been printed. Regarding promotion methods, after each type is printed, Zhenzhong will send 50 copies to the Ministry of Education and send 50 to 200 copies to the education departments of various provinces and cities so that the Ministry of Education and the education departments of various provinces and cities can distribute them to their subordinate educational institutions for application. The rest will be left to the bureau to be responsible for the sale. This is roughly the process of the Ministry of Education editing and reviewing popular reading materials in the past two years. Recently, the Ministry of Education has set up a Popular Reading Materials Group under the Textbook Editing Committee to promote wartime social education, because popular reading materials are more important. After reviewing the past, the process is briefly described above.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Universities in Various Places</h3>
<p>Chengdu: Since the private Guanghua University was established in Chengdu, there are more than 600 students in the university and middle school departments. On New Year's Day in 1939, the university department was first moved to the newly built school building in the western suburbs of Chengdu for classes.</p>
<p>Zhengjiang: The National Sun Yat-sen University has selected Zhengjiang, Yunnan Province as the school site. It has previously sent staff to establish offices in Kunming, Longzhou, Hong Kong and other places to carry out preparations. Classes started in February of this year.</p>
<p>Lantian: After the National Normal College was established in Lantian, Hunan, students arrived at the college one after another. The Ministry of Education previously uniformly enrolled students and distributed 171 new students. Classes have been going on for a long time. On February 14 this year, a supplementary opening ceremony was held. Principals of various middle schools in Hunan were in Lantian for a meeting and all participated, making it a grand event. The nine newly built classrooms of the college were also named at the completion ceremony held on the same day.</p>
<p>Yishan: The National Zhejiang University moved to Yishan last autumn and started classes on November 1. The new students did not start classes until January 1 this year because the houses were insufficient and could not be built in time. This year, many teachers have been added and the tutor system has been actively promoted. The Ministry of Education has distributed new students, and as of this month, 299 have arrived at the school.</p>
<p>Kunming: The National Tongji University was ordered to move to Yunnan and temporarily used the outside of the East Gate of Kunming as the general office of the school. The school buildings and equipment have gradually been prepared and classes will resume on March 1. The Tangshan Institute of Technology of National Jiaotong University has moved from Hunan to Yunnan. All staff and students have arrived in Guizhou safely. Because there are no suitable buildings in Longzhou and there is no transportation, they have gone to Guizhou to transfer to Yunnan.</p>

<h3>School Overview: Daozhong Women's Supplementary School</h3>
<p>The Daozhong Women's Supplementary School on Avenue Road was established sixteen years ago as a half-day supplementary class for women affiliated to Daozhong Girls' School. The original site was on Qujiang Road in Zhabei. At that time, there were no such schools in Shanghai. It gave adult women the opportunity to study while taking care of housework. The class pioneered supplementary education for women in Shanghai. In addition to the main subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics, it also taught skill subjects such as sewing, embroidery, and home economics. For a time, many students enrolled. The school building was destroyed in the fire in January 28. Principal Cui Jianwu planned for a long time and moved the school to its current address for reconstruction. After the chaos, those who carried books came in droves, even more than in the old days. In August 1933, the board of directors decided to expand the classes and rename it Daozhong Women's Supplementary School, with ordinary and vocational departments. The ordinary department is divided into three classes: senior, intermediate, and junior, and compulsory subjects such as Chinese, English, mathematics, bookkeeping, housekeeping, and letters are taught. The vocational department is divided into five subjects: sewing, embroidery, weaving, shorthand, and typing. The equipment is well-equipped, the management and teaching are strict, and in order to take care of poor women who are interested in studying, there are also methods for applying for tuition reduction and exemption for relief. It is reported that since this semester, the school has added school buildings and hired many teachers with both academic experience and excellence, and is actively moving forward. Therefore, the number of students has increased sharply, exceeding the records of previous years.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spring Sales Launched, Fine Yarn Jumps by Eight Yuan; Only 20s Yarn Remains Dull Due to Crowded Inventory</h3>
<p>The yarn market still cannot escape the wandering phenomenon, because actual demand is flat, which makes people feel calm. However, the situation of 32s and 42s fine yarn is becoming increasingly tight, actually due to the development of spring sales, the Jiangxi gang is eager to search, coupled with the lack of spot chips on the market, and the factory's production spindles are very few, so business rises slightly, and the market price recovers. As for 20s yarn, because the inventory is thicker, and the factory's output has increased, while the southern demand is not as prosperous as before, the market is loose, so the 20s Double Horse yarn price has been in and out of the 400 yuan mark many times for a long time, but the public psychology is that the arrival of raw materials is weak, the price is rising daily, and the factory's cost is increased, it is expected that the factory will not be willing to sell cheaply, so although the transaction is sluggish, the holders maintain their positions, and the market situation is awkward, neither can it fall nor can it rise. But the momentum of 32s and 42s fine yarn is becoming increasingly tight, actual transactions are rising according to the season, and the demand is increasing relatively, but the production is more powerful, so the rising wind is actively advancing, and the price is six to eight yuan higher than the previous day.

After that, there was still not much change, and after the afternoon opening, the fine yarn market price rose step by step, and the 20s yarn was also brought up, rising five jiao, and the 20s Double Horse yarn price was 400 yuan, 0.05 jiao. As a result, 1,390 bales were traded, and the same industry still accounted for the majority, the trend of 20s Double Horse rose five jiao, and Te Jin Cheng rose one yuan, the rest were stable, only fine yarn jumped six to eight yuan, the factory did not move, today cotton yarn has one hundred and sixty-five pieces shipped to Tianjin, two hundred and fifty-five pieces shipped to Shantou, and the amount bought by each gang is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The selling price of Japanese yarn is still dull, because the northern sales route is stagnant again, so the market situation is even more frustrated, the current yarn price of 20s Water Moon is 335 yuan, and the current yarn price of 20s Blue Phoenix is 329 yuan, not much different from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Sales Are Gradually Flourishing</h3>
<p>The local cotton business is developing more and more. Shenxin Factory's purchase of American and Indian cotton is especially huge, and it has also begun to purchase and apply local cotton. Therefore, the market price continues to advance, the general holders, given the lack of source and the daily depletion of inventory, the idea of hoarding is even more important, the market price has stepped up as a result. The same industry's trading is mostly occupied by Tianjin fine velvet, fire engine flower still makes 70 yuan, spot price, and now Qiong cotton industry people say that the goods in various producing areas are still congested and unable to ship, and the goods are rotten on the ground. If you try to reach Shanghai, the profit is thick and unspeakable, so traffickers have not been cut off, but the amount is fine, but the interest is quite thick, the wharf arrives with 119 bales of Xiasha flower, and 10,000 bales of Yao flower, but according to another report, Yao flower is shipped from Ningbo only 3,470 pieces. The situation of current cotton is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>British Cloth Widely Promoted, Driving US Cotton Sales; Rumor of US Loan Cotton Release of 500,000 Bales; Also Rumor of Shen Xin Importing 6,000 Bales of Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices, New York and Lancashire cloth sales are increasingly widespread, the cotton available for sale on the market is becoming increasingly scarce, and the remaining cotton is all of the lowest grade. The issue of the US government's loan cotton sales has not yet been resolved. The need for raw cotton is increasing daily. Before the new cotton arrives on the market, a large amount of loan cotton needs to be released to facilitate circulation and meet the needs. Although representatives from Lancashire have been dispatched to negotiate with US Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace to release some loan cotton first, US congressmen have also suggested to the government that Smith's proposal be slightly revised to find a way to release 500,000 bales of loan cotton ahead of schedule. The New York cotton market is showing exceptional strength, rising another seven or eight pounds yesterday. In India, due to Gandhi's hunger strike, the exchange has suspended trading, but a major cotton firm received a telegram predicting that the price of Broach cotton in April and May will be 156 rupees, more than four rupees higher than the exchange price last week. Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate was looser. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices increased by four jiao per dan for US cotton and Brazilian cotton, two jiao for Indian cotton, and more than seven jiao for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are unusually quiet because the soaring overseas cotton market, when converted to legal tender, is not cost-effective. However, it is rumored on the market that Shen Xin has purchased another 6,000 bales of Indian cotton, but this has not been confirmed. With the price of Indian cotton soaring, Shen Xin is unlikely to order foreign cotton. Moreover, the factory has a large inventory, so it will not purchase at a high price. Xin Yu has a strong intention to purchase, but due to the large price difference, although a telegram has been sent to Mumbai, it is feared that a deal will be difficult to reach. Japanese factories have traded 3,000 bales of Indian cotton, including 1,500 bales for the Shanghai factory, 500 bales for Yu Feng, and 500 bales each for Da Kang and Toyota. The factory prices of cotton yesterday, converted to legal tender, are listed below:</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Yarn: Over 15,000 Bales Traded; Coarse Yarn Accounts for 80%; Trade in Eastern Zhejiang Still Feels Sluggish</h3>
<p>From February 27th to March 5th, the yarn market for the past week has shown a lively atmosphere due to the start of spring sales. Hua Nan, Yunnan gangs, Hua Bei, and Tianjin gangs have successively launched purchases, which has boosted morale and revitalized the market. However, an examination of the goods purchased shows that 10-count coarse yarn accounts for over 80%, while the demand for fine yarn remains flat, so the selling price of coarse yarn has suddenly become tight. At the same time, factories are opening frequently to meet the needs of all parties. As a result, the price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn has increased by four and a half yuan compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Factories are opening 610 bales of 10-count coarse yarn and 150 bales of 20-count fine yarn. In Eastern Zhejiang, the shipping of cloth is gradually increasing, but cotton yarn transactions are still sluggish. In southern Fujian, Japanese warships are gathering, and merchants are worried, so yarn sales declined again on the weekend. The prospects will be difficult to improve without the development of several batches of transactions, and currently remain in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Yunnan Gang: 3,080 bales</p>
<p>Tianjin Gang: 2,755 bales</p>
<p>Trading Houses: 7,185 bales</p>
<p>Others: 2,235 bales</p>
<p>Total Weekly Transactions: 15,235 bales</p>
<h3>Securities: Rising; Foreign Debt Quiet</h3>
<p>The securities gray market yesterday continued to strengthen due to the vigorous buying by general bulls. It is generally believed that a new loan is about to be established, which has boosted morale. In reality, the UK is providing economic assistance to China while using it to suppress Japan, making it easier for Japan to comply. However, British diplomacy is known for its mystery, and there is probably no such simple and straightforward action. The internal situation is still unpredictable. Although the loan of 3 million pounds is limited, it is still beneficial. Observation from a rights perspective shows that so-called large investors are still selling at high prices, but there are many sellers and they are widely dispersed. At this time, the rights are narrow, and it is feared that it will be difficult to maintain for long. The market opened in the morning with strong buying of No. 35. Nos. 10, 15, and 7 all saw selling. The market price rose from low to high, and retail investors also bought more than they sold. In the forenoon, it was slightly firmer by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, Tiansheng, Lianhe, Gongmao, and No. 20 all had considerable interest, and No. 7 also continued to show interest. Nos. 10 and Xie Da sold. The market was still more in demand than supply, and the market price gradually and suddenly strengthened, rising another three or four jiao. At this time, the bulls had become unified, but without large investors, the prospects may still change. As a result, the market price continued to rise uniformly by four or five jiao, with a total transaction volume of approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Yesterday, 150 shares of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 26.5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds, quoted on Monday, the 6th of this month, Anglo-German Continued Loans, Anglo-French bonds jumped by one and a half pounds, priced at 75 pounds; Longhai Railway bonds rose by one pound, priced at 14.5 pounds; Sino-French US 5% bonds, printed bonds and Fix aircraft loan bonds each rose by half a pound, the former priced at 66.5 pounds and the latter priced at 14.5 pounds, the rest remained unchanged. London supply and demand also remained quiet.</p>
<p>London British Far East Companies Stocks, quoted on Monday, the 6th of this month, only Kaiping Coal Mines bearer shares rose by three pence, priced at 17 shillings and six pence, the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Lee Wai Motors Dividend: 50% Weekly Interest</h3>
<p>Consolidated Rubber Shares Also Pay Dividends. The British Consolidated Rubber Estates Limited, managed by Xiang Mao Yanghang in this port, announced yesterday that the profits for 1938 were 49,327.90 yuan in national currency, which, added to the carry-over from the previous year, totaled 63,190.18 yuan in national currency. The company's board of directors has now decided to transfer 25,000 yuan in national currency from the reserve fund, bringing the total dividend distribution account to 88,190.18 yuan in national currency. After paying a dividend of 0.12 yuan per share, totaling 58,180.44 yuan in national currency, and allocating 16,225.03 yuan in national currency for depreciation reserves, the remaining 13,784.71 yuan in national currency will be carried over to the next year. It is reported that this distribution plan must be approved by the shareholders' meeting on the 22nd of this month before it can be paid out.</p>
<p>The board of directors of Lee Wai Motors Limited in this port resolved yesterday to pay the final dividend for 1938, which is 2 yuan in national currency per share. Including the two interim dividends paid last year, the total dividend paid is 4 yuan in national currency per share (face value of 8 yuan in national currency per share).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Demand for Fine Yarn Fabrics Increasing; Pricing of Poplin from Various Factories Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>National cloth uses fine yarn thread as raw material, and there is a lack of spot goods. Due to the seasonal shift, the demand for fine yarn thread fabrics from both domestic and foreign locations has expanded, so sales are smooth and supply cannot meet demand. The pricing of plain and fancy poplin from various factories is gradually increasing, and the current market price is continuing to rise by about 0.3 yuan per piece compared to the end of last month. The asking price is particularly high. The selling prices of foreign yarn, hemp yarn, and bleached cloth have also increased uniformly. The Sichuan gang's demand is continuous, and they are continuing to purchase over 2,000 pieces of bleached cloth, hemp yarn, plain and fancy poplin, printed cloth, printed twill, and dyed cloth. The Guangdong gang is purchasing over 200 pieces of poplin, dyed cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. The Wen Yong gang is purchasing 100+ cases of bleached cloth, bleached twill, poplin, foreign yarn, and dyed cloth, 70-80 bales of white goods, fine cloth, twill, and group cloth. The selling price is flat. Bleaching and dyeing factories on this street have a considerable demand for fine yarn thread gray cloth. Due to the cold and cloudy weather, retail business remains quiet. The military situation in northern Jiangsu is tense, and a large number of transactions in that area have been temporarily suspended. Wholesale transactions in the interior are also rare.</p>
<p>The market for white goods in Dongpi is turning firmer because the Tianjin gang dumped goods the day before yesterday and then searched for more yesterday. Yanging customers also absorbed some. The wholesale demand for fine cloth and fine twill from various brands such as Beilu Gongjin on this street is sluggish, but the actual sales to dyeing factories are gradually increasing, so the turnover of fine cloth reached over 800 pieces yesterday and fine twill reached approximately 200 pieces. The selling price rebounded by 0.09-0.15 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Today, 800 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, 200 pieces to Yantai, 64 pieces to Weihaiwei, 315 pieces to Shantou, and 40 pieces to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 575 pieces of cotton textiles arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Authorities Cracking Down on Speculation; Yokohama Silk Futures and Spot Prices Plunge; Silk Prices in This City Also Fall Secretly by 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in Yokohama suddenly turned sharply lower. The spot price opened in the morning at 1,020 yuan, and in the afternoon at 1,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 55 yuan compared to the previous day. The forward price was 978 yuan, and in the afternoon 959 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 yuan compared to the previous day. It is believed that this is due to the Japanese authorities cracking down on speculation. New York and Lyon fluctuated slightly yesterday, and will inevitably fall today. This publication has repeatedly pointed out the risks of this silk market rally. Although the objective and subjective environment of the silk industry is conducive to hoarding and speculation, speculators or industrialists cannot avoid the cycle of "capital-commodity-". Therefore, a price increase can stimulate actual sales, but it must not deviate from actual sales. Otherwise, even if the regulatory authorities do not crack down on speculation, after market order is disrupted and commodities are released, an unexpected price drop will inevitably follow the crazy price increase.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port also weakened accordingly. Bai Changjing's prices inside and outside were not opening, and silk prices had secretly fallen by 30 yuan. There were also no transactions in Indian shops. It is believed that the silk market in this port will also move downstream from observation.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybeans under Japanese Control</h3>
<p>The soybean market can be discussed in two ways. First, Dalian quick soybeans were still firm in the morning due to the bullish outlook in Dalian City. Afterwards, the bulls took advantage of the Dalian price increase to release goods, which weakened the market. As a result, Dalian soybeans for April delivery fell by 0.2 yuan, with about 10 cars changing hands, and 3 cars for May delivery at a price of 8.5 yuan. Other sand yellow Du soybeans are in short supply due to seasonal reasons, so morale is still solid and the market continues to rise. It is estimated that over 150 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans changed hands at prices ranging from 8.4 to 8.3 yuan, 20 bags of Pudong Du soybeans at a price of 10 yuan, and 70 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans at a price of 13.02 yuan.</p>
<p>526 bags of soybeans arrived in Tianjin on the 7th, and 1,480 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong and 500 bags to Yantai on the 8th.</p>
<p>The peanut oil market had rumors that Qingdao had a lenient solution, so well-informed people took the lead and immediately sold 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at a price of 26 yuan, a decrease of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's market. Afterwards, those who floated and hoarded quickly sold 150 pieces for profit at a price of 25.5 yuan, a further decrease of 0.5 yuan. However, bonded warehouse oil opened in the morning, so the market was unusually stagnant, but the situation was also dangerous. Yantai canned oil initially opened at 34 yuan, then fell to 33.5 yuan. As a result, it also fell by 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day's market. Yesterday, 500 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The soybean oil market, under organized manipulation, began to decline. The market was once chaotic, and prices fell frequently. The market was slightly clearer at the close, and a total of 0.4-0.5 yuan was shaved. A total of 250 barrels of current Dalian oil, 75 barrels of March upper, 800-900 barrels of March lower, 100+ barrels of April upper, and 50 barrels of April were sold.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Rise Further</h3>
<p>Yesterday's supply from various gangs was still only No. 3 from Hexia. There were no carloads of buns due to the train stoppage. As a result, morale was even higher and the price increases became more intense. Warehouse goods were taken advantage of for release, and hoarders absorbed a considerable amount. All goods already show a chaotic image. The general market and high-priced goods are opening at 14 yuan, and mid-range goods are also already above 13 yuan. The situation is the same for Yangjian. Doushanjian rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan, and Bianyuan rose again by more than 0.5 yuan. In short, this phenomenon has a significant impact on the future of food for the people.</p>

<h3>Today's Women's World: Commemorating the March 8th Women's Day; Expressing Respect to Madame Chiang Kai-shek; The Municipal Party Headquarters Exhorts with Three Matters</h3>
<p>Today is "March 8th" Women's Day. The women's community in this city deeply recognizes that women's liberation and national liberation are inseparable. At this time of the sacred War of Resistance, which continues to advance, the final victory is not far off, and it expresses boundless enthusiasm and excitement. Although the women's community will not hold a grand celebration today, women's groups and women's primary and secondary schools will hold commemorative ceremonies and luncheons to encourage each other to fulfill the responsibilities that women should fulfill in this extraordinary period. The various women's groups have expressed their deep respect for Madame Chiang Kai-shek Mei-ling Soong, who leads the national women's community in participating in the War of Resistance and disaster relief. The Shanghai Women's Relief Association for Refugees, considering that the refugees are victims of the country and suffering in their lives, has specially designated representatives to visit various shelters from today onwards to express condolences.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters issued a letter to all women compatriots in the city on the occasion of March 8th, saying: The great March 8th Women's Day has arrived again in the phase of the War of Resistance entering the later stage and the national revolutionary movement becoming more favorable. Recalling the glorious historical traces of our country's War of Resistance in the past, looking forward to the arduous tasks at hand, and the tragic devastation suffered by women in the war zone, displaced and suffering, how will the women compatriots in Shanghai be excited, angry, and vigilant, stepping on the blood of the martyrs, seeking the true liberation of the nation, and striving for the permanent survival of the country? The strong War of Resistance in the past 20 months has already laid the foundation for the final victory. The women compatriots across the country have also generally awakened in this high tide of the War of Resistance. Whether in the occupied areas, in the rear, or on the battlefield, there are vast women's masses who dedicate themselves to the country, doing comfort, rescue, and military-civilian cooperation work on the front line, and doing public propaganda, organization, training, comforting soldiers' families, and participating in production work in the rear. Even the women compatriots trapped on the isolated island are not willing to lag behind and have fulfilled considerable responsibilities such as donating funds and rescuing the distressed. Now that the War of Resistance and national construction have entered a new period, and the final victory is getting closer and closer, the work is also entering a more arduous and critical stage. What the country expects from our national people is even more eager. Only by further concentrating the national human, material, and financial resources can we seize the favorable conditions for overcoming the enemy and completing the final mission of the national revolution. Only in this way can Sun Yat-sen's new China be realized sooner. Here, the women compatriots in Shanghai really need to work harder and strengthen their struggle.</p>
<p>First, planning the national spiritual mobilization. Our country's War of Resistance is materially inferior to the enemy, but spiritually, the enemy is far inferior to us. From now on, the material differences between the enemy and us will become closer due to the enemy's financial and economic difficulties and our continuous innovation. The difference between the enemy and us in spirit will increase due to the high tide of the anti-war sentiments of the enemy's military and civilians and the more determined will of our War of Resistance. This spiritual advantage is a strong guarantee for us to achieve the final victory. Our highest leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has personally formulated the outline and implementation methods of the national spiritual mobilization in order to fully encourage this favorable condition, hoping that under the unified and powerful belief that our national people will win the War of Resistance and succeed in national construction, we can concentrate human, material, and financial resources to crush the enemy's conspiracy to paralyze and corrupt the spirit of our nation, and defeat the stubborn enemy forces that have fallen into difficulties, and complete the great task of War of Resistance and national construction. The influence that our women compatriots can appeal to people in the family and in society is really pivotal. It is hoped that the women compatriots in Shanghai will strive to rectify themselves, from themselves to their families to society, and strive to eliminate all hesitant and wavering thoughts, establish a correct revolutionary will, make traitors and puppets repent, at least not be able to gain a foothold in the family and society, rectify the source, and women compatriots bear a major mission.</p>
<p>Second, thoroughly implement the work of boycotting enemy goods. Since the "July 7th" Incident launched the war of aggression, the enemy has spent tens of billions of war expenses, and what they have gained, in addition to occupying some points and lines, is only the unprecedented deterioration of international relations, and the aggressor military has fallen into the predicament of being unable to defend themselves. Especially in terms of finance and economy, there is a danger of total collapse. The final struggle is to plunder resources and collect wealth within our country, and implement large-scale dumping. The so-called economic promotion and economic cooperation are only aimed at taking Japan as the mainstay to complete its monopoly and monopolize our country's economic lifeline. If our national people can recognize where the enemy's conspiracy lies and completely eliminate enemy goods, the enemy's economy and finances will accelerate their bankruptcy. Therefore, our women compatriots must deeply understand the advantages and disadvantages, and absolutely refuse to purchase and use enemy goods. If they can do it thoroughly, the benefit to the future of the War of Resistance will not be less than that of the soldiers who kill the enemy on the front line.</p>
<p>Third, expand the savings and donation movement. The savings and donation movement has achieved considerable results in Shanghai in the past, but if we examine it carefully, first, the work is not universal and in-depth enough, especially it cannot reach the affluent and superior classes. Second, it has not been able to truly achieve donations from savings, still similar to ordinary donations. Now that the War of Resistance and national construction have reached a critical juncture, we can only rely on the national people to be thrifty and tighten their belts to increase production capital and actively donate funds to improve the national strength of the War of Resistance in order to guarantee the final victory. The citizens of Shanghai are immersed in an atmosphere of extravagance and decadence, and those who have accumulated bad habits are still visible everywhere. I sincerely hope that the women compatriots in Shanghai will supervise each other and create a center of social frugality. Especially if the women compatriots in Shanghai can take the lead in self-encouragement, the savings movement will achieve more than half of the results. Furthermore, donating the savings to the government will be of great benefit to the country. Recently, women's donations in Chongqing reached 700,000 yuan. If the women compatriots in Shanghai can enthusiastically contribute, it must be more than this number, and it is necessary to promote it universally and practically. The above three matters are only a few of the most important ones. Our women compatriots should make greater contributions and make more courageous struggles to the War of Resistance and national construction based on the past revolutionary spirit. We must know that when the final victory of our country's War of Resistance is achieved, it will also be the day when our national women compatriots are thoroughly liberated. Finally, I respectfully wish all women compatriots in the city a successful effort.</p>
<h3>Unstamped Shops: Chamber of Commerce Informs to Rectify</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified all industries of the new regulations for stamping, all shops and firms in this port have followed them after resuming business for the year. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce learned that a very small number of shops have not implemented the regulations. In order to effectively rectify this, the Chamber of Commerce has separately informed each of these shops to comply with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Action Begins in Northern Jiangsu; Requires Third-Country Nationals to Mark Property with National Flags on a Flat Surface; Japanese Warships Bombard the Sheyang River Estuary Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy announced last night (6th) that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, notified the Shanghai Consular Corps yesterday that the Japanese army is currently launching military operations in northern Jiangsu. The Consular Corps should notify the third-country nationals residing in the area in advance. The note from Miura stated that the Japanese army will "specially" conduct military operations in the Huaiyang and Xuhai areas. The Huaiyang area is the area near Huaiyin and Siyang, while the Xuhai area extends from Xuzhou to Haizhou. The note also requested that the property and houses belonging to third-country nationals in the area be marked with their national flags, but they must be marked on a flat surface and be sufficiently large and clear to avoid accidental bombing. According to the New News Agency, according to shipping industry sources, a Japanese warship suddenly fired more than a dozen shells at the shore at the Sheyang River estuary in Funing, northern Jiangsu, at about 8:00 a.m. yesterday. At the same time, three Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky. The military authorities in the area had already taken strict precautions, and the Sheyang River estuary has also been blockaded. This move by the Japanese side seems to be exploring the strength of the defending troops. Chinese troops have gathered in the Funing area to prepare for resistance.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Consul in Hankou Assaults Japanese Sentry; Japanese Side Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that according to yesterday's (6th) Japanese Continental News, an unfortunate incident occurred at the border between the French Concession and Special District 2 in Hankou on Saturday night. Once the investigation is completed, the Japanese authorities will lodge a strong protest with the Portuguese authorities in China against the behavior of the Portuguese Consul in Hankou, Belchinko. The newspaper further stated that according to information obtained by this port yesterday, Belchinko forcibly opened the gate between the French Concession and Special District 2, which had been closed at 10:00 p.m., at 11:07 p.m. on Saturday night, and beat one of the Japanese sentries with a cane. Belchinko himself injured his hand on the barbed wire. Because Belchinko was an official, the sentry allowed him to return to his residence, but he was summoned to the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters for questioning on Sunday.</p>
<h3>National Regular Army Has Entered the Jinghu Line, Shangguan Yunxiang Appointed Commander, Japanese Army Panicked, Deploying Fortifications, Changshu Puppet Police Entirely Subdued</h3>
<p>The central government has prepared for the guerrillas in the Jinpu Railway area, and three elite regular divisions have been transferred from a certain location at the beginning of this month, under the command of Shangguan Yunxiang. A large-scale general counter-offensive will soon occur. The Japanese army is extremely panicked and has been deploying defensive fortifications on the Jinpu Railway line for days. The details are as follows, as reported by a reporter from the Modern News Agency:</p>
<p>Regular Army Deployed to Jinpu Line</p>
<p>The central government has made overall plans for the military operations in various guerrilla areas and has established a Guerrilla Headquarters. Chairman Jiang concurrently serves as the Director-General and has designated various provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shandong, etc., to be divided into several districts. A sub-bureau will be established in each district. The senior military and political officials have already been appointed, and each district is actively proceeding. It is learned that regarding the Jinpu Railway line, the central government has dispatched three elite regular divisions, totaling over 40,000 men, which arrived at various locations along the Jinpu Railway at the beginning of this month according to the planned schedule. All original guerrilla units scattered in various districts that were engaged in attacking the Japanese army have been reorganized by the regular army as reserve teams, staying behind to guard the local area and not disturbing the people. All supplies are issued by the central government.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Panicked, Deploying Fortifications After the war zone was expanded, most of the Japanese army in the rear has been transferred to the front line for combat. The number of Japanese soldiers guarding the Jinpu Railway line is only about one division, and many of these soldiers are new recruits enlisted domestically and sent to China. Their strength is quite weak. In recent days, the Japanese side has been deploying fortifications along the Jinpu Railway line day and night. Because the anti-war sentiment among the Japanese troops in various places has been strong recently, and the puppet troops that have been incorporated have also defected from time to time, the Japanese military authorities are uneasy and the situation is extremely tense and panicked.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Guerrilla Warfare Launched The central government has appointed Shangguan Yunxiang to command the guerrilla warfare on the Jinpu Railway line. It is learned that he has arrived at a certain location and, together with the head of the Jiangsu Guerrilla Sub-bureau, is inspecting the Jinpu Railway line and carrying out preparations for the general counter-offensive. It is expected that large-scale guerrilla warfare will be launched on the Jinpu Railway line in the shortest possible time. As for the puppet troops, police, and security teams in various counties that have surrendered to the Japanese and been incorporated, the central government has given them nominal status and will take the opportunity to respond during the general counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Cao Changjin's Troops Enter Changshu On the evening of the 6th, Guerrilla Captain Cao Changjin led his troops from Tangshizhen and stormed into the west gate of Changshu, surrounding the puppet Jiangzhe Fourth District Pacification Headquarters and forcing them to surrender their weapons. The puppet commander Xu Fengzao fled in panic, and the remaining troops abandoned their weapons and surrendered. Cao's troops captured 260 rifles, 57 Mauser pistols, and 12 light and heavy machine guns without bloodshed, and subdued 280 puppet police officers. After sounding the horns and reorganizing the team, they withdrew from the city and returned to the outskirts to await opportunities for attack.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Zhabei Adds Bunkers The Japanese army in Shanghai, fearing attacks by Chinese guerrillas, has increased its troops and set up defensive fortifications in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, and West Shanghai. They have also sealed off empty houses in Nanshi and Zhabei to prevent guerrillas from hiding. Yesterday, the Japanese and puppet forces carried out work to seal off empty houses in Pudong and West Shanghai. At the same time, they added bunkers and stationed troops for defense in various districts such as Baziqiao, Miaohang, and Zhongshan Road Bridge. On the one hand, the Japanese army patrolled in groups of three or five, and the level of fear was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in West Shanghai According to villagers traveling to and from the guerrilla area, recently, large groups of Japanese troops have suddenly gone to garrison in Beixinjing, Hongqiao, Hejiajiao, and other places. They are conducting stricter inspections of people entering and leaving, and in addition to dispatching sentries at various water and land transportation points, they have also added defensive materials. In the Chenjiazhai area west of the Daxilu Railway, Japanese troops have dug trenches. Around 9:00 a.m. the previous morning, those coming to Shanghai from West Shanghai heard rumbling cannon fire and dense machine gun fire. Judging from the situation, it seemed to be live ammunition exercises by the Japanese army. However, given the tense atmosphere of navigation in West Shanghai recently, it may be to prevent guerrilla attacks and therefore a show of force for deterrence.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Area Establishes Administrative Committee, Baoshan and Other Counties Begin Implementation, Requesting the Provincial Government to Appoint Supervisory Officials</h3>
<p>More than a year has passed since the nine counties of Songjiang Prefecture in southern Jiangsu fell into enemy hands. However, a large part of the land is still under the control of our guerrillas. However, local administration cannot be without personnel for a single day, and some county magistrates appointed by the provincial government have not yet taken office. The guerrillas are also not in a position to overstep their authority and interfere, so there is a lack of leading officials and local politics cannot be promoted. The local gentry and influential figures in each county, based on their patriotic and pro-homeland enthusiasm, have jointly organized the Jiangsu Province Songjiang Prefecture Nine Counties Administrative Committee, inviting local figures of high reputation from each county to serve as members. On the one hand, they have submitted a report to the provincial government and the War Zone Headquarters for record, and on the other hand, they have established county administrative committees in each of these counties, acting on behalf of the county magistrate before he takes office, assisting the government, and promoting local administration, so as to integrate with the people's armed forces. It is now heard that Baoshan and other counties have begun implementation, and representatives will be sent to the provincial government to request the appointment of supervisory officials. Once approved by the superiors, it can be formally established.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Quanzhou, Destroying Foreign Merchant Warehouses, Two Foreign Ships Searched on the Same Day, Japanese艇 Also Seized and Burned Sailing Ships</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that on Friday of last week, a Japanese seaplane flew twice over the vicinity of Quanzhou, fifty miles north of Xiamen, destroying a warehouse belonging to a foreign merchant. According to news received in this port yesterday (the 6th), a warehouse belonging to Jardine Matheson, whose head office is in Hong Kong, was severely damaged in Quanzhou during the air raid. However, whether there were casualties is not yet known. On the same day, two foreign ships were boarded and inspected by sailors from a Japanese cruiser, delaying their voyage due to the verification of documents. According to what was learned last night, one of the ships was the Taikoo Company's Anqing, which is currently sailing on the Xiamen-Manila line. It is heard that the other ship belongs to Douglas Company. The Taikoo Company's office in this port had not yet received any information last night about the Anqing being searched, because after the ship stopped sailing to Shanghai, it was impossible to receive its report immediately. According to another report, when the vicinity of Quanzhou was raided on Friday, two Japanese armed motorboats were seen entering the inner harbor, seizing two Fuzhou sailing ships and setting them on fire.</p>

<h3>Soybean and Rice Market Strictly Enforces Price Limits, Announces to All Guilds to Maintain the People's Food Supply and Continue Trading, Rice Industry Groups Announce the Reasons for Soaring Rice Prices, Guild Sends Letter to Concession Authorities to Order Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Industry Association of this city recently decided through a joint meeting of all executives and supervisors to maintain the price limit of 14 yuan due to the soaring rice prices in Shanghai, which affects the people's food supply. An announcement was issued to all guilds and merchants to comply. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, the trading situation tended to ease, but the market price still rose. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sub-Association Announces to All Guilds and Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association issued an announcement to all guilds and merchants in the rice market yesterday, stating: "Recently, rice prices have been rising and have reached the original price limit. However, there are still 600,000 to 700,000 bags of rice in Shanghai, and the supply has not been interrupted. It should not be scarce for a while. For the sake of the people's food supply in this city, the original price limit should still be maintained. The highest price of white rice should not exceed 14 yuan per picul. This has been decided by our association. It is hoped that all guilds and merchants will consider the overall situation and comply accordingly, and do not exceed the price limit, so as to maintain the people's food supply. This is what we earnestly hope. This announcement is hereby made on March 7, 28th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Transactions by Merchants Still Rose Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Soybean and Rice Industry Association decided at a joint meeting of all executives and supervisors on the 6th of this month that the rice price in this city should still maintain the original price limit of 14 yuan per picul and should not exceed it, a notice was posted to inform all guilds and merchants to comply. After the rice market opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, although囤户 (tun hu - households hoarding goods) and merchants had some goods arriving and being sold, the quantity was limited, while the sales volume increased significantly, so the market price still rose. The highest market price, excluding commissions, has reached the peak of the price limit, and there is a tendency to exceed it.</p>
<p>Market Strictly Enforces Price Limits</p>
<p>The Management Committee of the Rice Market at 550 Fuzhou Road in this city strictly enforces the price limit in accordance with the association's decision. In order to prevent colleagues and merchants from engaging in private off-market transactions outside the price limit, so that the market price is raised invisibly, all management committee members are uniformly present in the market for supervision to suppress it. If any similar off-market transaction is found to have occurred, it will be reported to the association for punishment.</p>
<p>Announcing Reasons for Soaring Rice Prices</p>
<p>According to a Modern News reporter's inquiry to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Firm Association, and various merchants transporting rice regarding the reasons for the soaring rice prices in Shanghai, the various groups announced the following: (1) After the autumn harvest last year, in addition to supplying the people of Shanghai, the rice and grain along the river was being collected and transported for export by a certain party in the interior in large quantities. Rice and grain from various producing areas that were not affected by the war were also being stored by the central government and not allowed to be transported out. (2) The area of the producing areas along the river is limited. After this large amount of export, the reserves are limited, resulting in a high rise in prices in the interior. In addition, the "institutions" of the Japanese and puppet regimes impose heavy taxes, causing losses for the various merchants transporting rice. (3) Although the rice reserves in Shanghai are sufficient, most of them are in the hands of囤户 (tun hu - households hoarding goods). According to general observation, rice prices are bound to rise when the new crop is not yet available, and there is a rare opportunity to profit, so囤户 (tun hu - households hoarding goods) are unwilling to sell, waiting for a good price. Based on the above reasons, rice prices in Shanghai have risen suddenly. It is possible to suppress the market price for the time being, but it is difficult to predict whether there will be a panic regarding rice and grain in the future.</p>
<p>Sending Letter to Concession to Order Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Industry Association of this city, in view of the large amount of rice and grain in the interior being directly exported, resulting in limited reserves in the producing areas, and fearing that a panic will occur in the Shanghai people's food supply when the new crop is not yet available, in order to take precautions, a letter has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Council, requesting them to make proper arrangements as soon as possible, and to present the current situation of rice markets in various places in detail to the authorities, and to suggest ordering foreign rice, so as to transport it to Shanghai to meet the future shortage of the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation in Zhenjiang, Receiving Shanghai Newspaper Leads to Arrest, Tragic Events Difficult to Describe</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, according to people from Zhenjiang, the state of Zhenjiang can be summarized in two phrases: the atrocities of the Japanese sentries and the rapid deterioration of the general situation. Because mail is inspected, it is difficult for accurate information to be transmitted from the interior to the city. Those who control the people are also trying to control the people's minds. Intellectual slaves fear that slaves are not as good as them. Recently, some people who received mailed Shanghai</p>
<p>Chinese evening newspapers were arrested and charged with crimes, because the authorities wanted to make the people only know what they wanted the people to know. Because the way to freely communicate accurate information has been blocked, it is not surprising that rumors arise. The streets are quite desolate at night, and curfews are sometimes implemented before 9:00 p.m. There is hardly any light on the streets. The main streets in the city are</p>
<p>Muddy all over the place when it rains, making it almost impossible to pass. Some shops have built sheds and are operating, because the people returning to the city are trying to find ways to make a living. The countryside is not peaceful day and night, and robberies are heard from time to time. Tragic events occur repeatedly and cannot be described one by one. For example, a farmer tried to chase after his donkey that had escaped, and when he caught it, he accidentally passed in front of a sentry and was shot and killed instantly. A businessman bowed to a sentry and accidentally dropped his hat. When he tried to pick it up, he was actually</p>
<p>Stabbed by a civilian officer. Slaps and other atrocities are even more numerous. A woman was stripped of her lower clothes and tied to a telephone pole because she was taking branches on the side of the mountain, because others used the branches there as fuel. In fact, even a blade of grass, a piece of wood, a brick, and a stone seem to be useful to others.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Exemption from Taxes on 1 Million Dan of Foreign Rice, to Provide Relief for the People's Food Supply in Chaozhou and Shantou in South China, Cracking Down on Manipulation, Protecting Good Residence</h3>
<p>The food supply in Chaozhou and Shantou in southern China has always relied on foreign rice and Shanghai rice to maintain. After the Jianghai Customs refused to allow the transshipment of rice and grain, rice merchants in Chaozhou and Shantou directly purchased goods from the producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and then loaded them onto foreign ships for transport to adjust the supply. However, due to the Japanese warships obstructing foreign ships from loading rice for transport to the south, Chaozhou, Shantou, and other gangs were unable to purchase goods from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, resulting in a rice shortage in the area, which was very serious. After various groups requested the government to allow tax-free imports of foreign rice, the Ministry of Finance reviewed and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which has approved 1 million dan of foreign rice to be imported to Chaozhou and Shantou tax-free, allowing rice merchants to freely order from overseas. Regarding how to prevent manipulation, prevent speculation, and fundamentally suppress rice prices so that ordinary people can obtain real benefits, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government has ordered Commissioner He and Mayor Wu to discuss methods with rice merchants.</p>
<h3>Factories on Yichang Road Request Postponement of Factory Site Relocation, to Avoid Displacement of More Than 1,000 Workers, Relocation Will Be Carried Out After the Difficult Times of the War Have Passed</h3>
<p>Sun Da Sawmill, Yifeng Stone Powder Factory, Qinhe Copper and Iron Foundry, Shen Chengyuan Shipping Factory, Dongfang Shipping Factory, Sanhexing Shipping Factory, Tailai Machinery Shipbuilding Factory, Xin Sheng Brick and Ash Line, and Shen Bin, representative of the workers in distress, jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union yesterday, stating: "The petition is for appealing for assistance in rescuing the livelihoods of workers in distress and postponing the relocation of factory sites and returning the land. Our factories, etc., are located at 300 Lane, Yichang Road, British Concession (i.e., along the Suzhou River, West Suzhou Road). We rented and demarcated the land from the Sheng Mansion in the past and built factory buildings, which has been more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Paying the rent annually. Suddenly, in the 26th year, we received a letter from Lawyer Yang Linzhi, representing China Business Corporation, notifying us of the management and ordering us to relocate and return the land. While we were contacting Mr. Dou Yaoting, the property manager of Huajing, to renew the lease, the war broke out in Shanghai, so it was put on hold. In November of that year, Lawyer Yang Linzhi, representing the plaintiff China Business Corporation Huaer Xuefu, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court,</p>
<p>Ordering us to relocate and return the land. After receiving the summons, the factories, etc., publicly hired Lawyer Jiang Yiping as their agent to plead. After several court sessions, we were sentenced to relocate and return the land by the end of October of the 27th year. Because the factories, etc., could not find land in various districts in the concession, we were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After two investigative hearings, at the third hearing, in order to follow the plaintiff's contact and not hurt feelings,</p>
<p>We reached a settlement limited to relocation by the end of March of the 28th year. Currently, there are more than 1,000 workers in distress who rely on working on the land for a living, as well as shantytowns. The factories, etc., are willing to return the land, but there is no land to be found in the concession area. If we go to the Chinese界 (Hua Jie - Chinese administered area), it has not yet been opened, and it concerns the reputation of Guan merchants. If we open factories, boats, ships, machines, and other items have no place to be stacked.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 workers and shantytowns have no livelihood, and there are more refugees in the concession area, which is also not a safe plan. Committee Member Zhu Qizhen of your association is nearby and knows the difficult situation, so he can understand it clearly. We know that American merchants value morality, so we request your association to examine and implement, provide strong assistance, and in this extraordinary period, when the war is prolonged, rescue the livelihoods of the factories, etc., persuade the landlords, and prioritize morality. Postpone the recovery of the land. If the landlords are compassionate and considerate, the factories, etc., will temporarily pay a certain amount of rent on a monthly basis, and we will relocate immediately after the difficult times of the war have passed, and there will be no reason to delay again. We will be extremely grateful to await your orders."</p>
<h3>Forty-Nine Japanese Police Arrive in Shanghai, Thirty Assigned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Japanese side currently has an increasing number of overseas Chinese in Shanghai, reaching more than 37,000 people. The police in the original consulate police station are no longer active in various districts in Hongkou, so the Japanese Consulate General had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for additional allocations. The new Japanese police officers have now been dispatched by the province, totaling 49 people, led by Japanese patrolman Uzawa. They arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on the 6th. It is heard that 30 of them will stay in Shanghai and be assigned to the Japanese Consulate General Police Station, while the other 19 will be assigned to Nanjing and Hankou within days.</p>
<p>###營業助捐 (Yingye Zhujuan - Business Assistance Donation) for the Machine Weaving and Cotton Cloth Industries, Divided into 1.5 Li and 3 Li, Implementation Begins on the 16th</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group held a symposium yesterday afternoon with the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association to discuss the collection of refugee donations. They all agreed that the two industries have a related relationship, and in order to avoid merchants taking advantage of the situation, it was decided to proceed simultaneously. It was immediately decided that a donation of 1.5 li would be collected for each 疋 (pi - bolt of cloth) of 国货证明书 (Guohuo Zhengmingshu - domestic goods certificate), 5 li would be collected for each 疋 (pi - bolt of cloth) of 零头证明书 (Lingtou Zhengmingshu - remnant certificate) colored cloth, and 3 li would be collected for each 疋 (pi - bolt of cloth) of white cloth. Fractions less than a 分 (fen) will be temporarily recorded, and implementation will begin on the 16th of this month. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Haiqi Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Hold Public Memorial Service for Zhang Tui'an, Held at Gongdelin</h3>
<p>Fellow townsmen from Haiqi in Shanghai held a public memorial service for Mr. Zhang Tui'an of Nantong at Gongdelin yesterday afternoon. More than 60 people attended, including Liu Qizheng, Shen Jun, Zhu Baoshan, Dong Yunshu, Ji Fang, Yan Jingzhi, Wang Zhaoqing, Yan Youlian, Lu Shusheng, and Chen Bokui. The memorial hall was filled with memorial banners and elegiac couplets, and the atmosphere was solemn. The public memorial service was held at 2:00 p.m., and Liu Qizheng, Shen Jun, Zhu Baoshan, Huang Xiuzhai, and others were elected as the main officiants. The ceremony was performed according to etiquette, and Yan Youlian respectfully read the eulogy, which contained "… Brothers are harmonious, respectful of their hometown, based on the training of 加教 (jia jiao - added education) for wealth, and practice it personally. Their achievements are remarkable, like the irrigation of thousands of miles by the rivers of the Yangtze and Huai, like the silent moisturizing of spring rain. Therefore, the 嗇公 (Se Gong - thrifty public official) cannot reach greatness, and the greatness of the public is that it cannot reach refinement. Without greatness, it is impossible to achieve refinement, and without refinement, it is impossible to achieve greatness. The mutual need and assistance of the two publics is truly like the heart and limbs, so the whole country, regardless of whether they know each other or not, will not refuse to call them difficult brothers and difficult friends. And north of the Yangtze River, the hidden depths of the East Sea, clouds and mists are steaming, and people are outstanding…" The words were several thousand words long. After the memorial service, a group photo was taken. Yesterday, Master Fan Cheng led dozens of male and female lay Buddhists in chanting sutras for a full day, and Lay Buddhist Zhao Yunshao gave a discourse. The ceremony was very solemn.</p>
<h3>Trade Commission Selectively Purchases Local Goods from Time to Time, Relevant Local Merchants Should Register Immediately, Requesting Permission to Lift the Ban on Pig Bristles</h3>
<p>After the Pig Trade Commission and others were ordered to purchase local goods, they have handled the registration of relevant merchants and are proceeding with the purchase, loading, and shipment of goods to the port for export, with the aim of rescuing farmers and merchants and increasing foreign exchange funds. Pig bristle and casing industries have powdered telegrams requesting a lifting of the ban. The Ministry has announced measures for the transportation of prohibited goods to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Handling Registration and Proceeding with Purchase</p>
<p>The Trade Commission's Zhejiang Office sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, etc., stating: "Dear Sirs, after the Zhejiang Customs announced the ban on the transportation of goods to Shanghai that should be settled in foreign exchange in eastern Zhejiang, most of them are stranded in Ningbo and cannot be shipped as scheduled. In order to rescue farmers and merchants and increase foreign exchange, we have presented a request to our General Association, and this office will selectively purchase them. We hereby inform you accordingly, and hope that you will check and inform all relevant merchants to come to our office to handle registration procedures from now on in order to purchase them. We are at your service."</p>
<p>Requesting Permission to Transport Pig Bristles to Shanghai for Brush Making</p>
<p>Before August 13th, there were more than 40 toothbrush factories, most of which were located in Nanshi. After the outbreak of the war, they successively moved to the concession and resumed work, with approximately 20 factories and more than 3,000 workers. Recently, due to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' ban on the transportation of pig bristles to Shanghai, the raw materials for toothbrushes have suddenly become scarce. Now, Shuanglun, Liang Xinji, Yixin, Xinxin, Standard, Mingxing, Gongshang, Aviation, Zhenyu, and other factories have jointly submitted a petition to the Chamber of Commerce to forward a telegram to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting permission to lift the ban on pig bristles and allow them to be transported to the Shanghai concession with proof in order to maintain their operations.</p>
<h3>Failure of Japan's Monetary Policy in North China (Part 2) - Resulting in the Sacrifice of Japanese Bank Notes - The North China Populace's Faith in the Legal Tender is Extremely Strong - Confession of Mitsuto Chuzo of Japan</h3>
<p>Holding Back Silver - In the two concessions, because this silver was intended to be the largest support for the "Joint Reserve Bank," the attempt to seize it hindered the smooth flow of the "Joint Reserve" paper currency to a considerable extent. Another obstacle faced by the "Bank" was its inability to freely sell foreign exchange because the "Joint Reserve Bank" still did not have sufficient foreign currency deposits. Its paper currency is now on par with Japanese bank notes. In order to make the new paper currency the only bank note circulating in its jurisdiction, the "North China Provisional Government" decided to recall the old currency issued by the various North China banks that had branches in Beiping and Tianjin. Within a year starting from March 10, 1938, the old currency could be exchanged for "Joint Reserve" paper currency at par. However, the paper currency issued by the Huafang Bank, which has its head office in Shanghai, was immediately</p>
<p>Prohibited from Circulation - It is estimated that there are a total of 430 to 450 million yuan of old currency circulating in North China, most of which are paper currencies of the Central Bank and Bank of Communications. In the nine months from March 10, 1937, the "Joint Reserve Bank" recovered no more than 13 million yuan of old currency. The amount of "Joint Reserve" paper currency in circulation is approximately 150 million yuan, most of which was issued to pay military expenses. The "Joint Reserve Bank" imitated the "Central Bank of Manchuria" and adopted the method used by the "Central Bank" to deal with the same problem of old currency. When the "Central Bank" was established, there were approximately 140 million yuan of old currency, of which 99 percent was circulating in Manchuria, all of which was</p>
<p>Recovered Within Two and a Half Years - However, the situation in North China is very different from the situation in Manchuria when the "Central Bank" was established. The existence of foreign concessions is the biggest obstacle. This is because foreign banks not only do not cooperate with the work of the "Joint Reserve Bank", but also hinder it to a considerable extent. The people of North China have more faith in the old currency than in the new currency, because the old currency in Manchuria was low in price and had no credit, so the "Central Bank of Manchuria" was able to sell foreign exchange upon request at the beginning of its operation, while the "Joint Reserve Bank" could not do so. Another important obstacle is the commercial situation, because North China is not like "Manchukuo." Apart from trade with "Mongolia and Tibet", its trade deficit is quite large. All these situations have</p>
<p>Obtained Foreign Currency - Made progress quite slow. Although the "Joint Reserve Bank" paper currency is not worth one shilling and two pence, it is at the same price as Japanese bank notes. Because of this fact, the situation continues to become serious. Merchants were soon encouraged to purchase "Joint Reserve" paper currency with old currency, and use "Joint Reserve" paper currency to pay for imported Japanese goods. As a result, Japanese bank notes were sacrificed, and the Bank of Japan suffered the same loss. Foreign banks' refusal to recognize the new currency has added more obstacles to the "Joint Reserve Bank's" foreign exchange situation. According to what I have heard, the intention of foreign banks seems to be that they cannot accept inconvertible currencies. However, the "Joint Reserve Bank" can use</p>
<p>Many Methods - To overcome the above-mentioned monetary obstacles in North China, and in fact, many methods have already been implemented. In order to encourage the public to trust the new paper currency, the "Joint Reserve Bank" must obtain sufficient foreign currency deposits, and when necessary, it can use these foreign currencies to sell foreign exchange. Japanese financial commissioners stationed in China and the management department of the "Joint Reserve Bank" are currently making promising efforts to strengthen the "Bank's" strength in this regard. For the same purpose, the North China "authorities" have adopted a foreign exchange control system and implemented certain restrictions on foreign trade. A more urgent and special problem is how to deal with the expiration of the circulation period of the old legal tender in March. As of now, as described above,</p>
<p>Out of 400 Million Yuan - Only 13 million yuan have been recovered. The course of action thereafter will largely depend on the situation when the deadline expires. However, no matter what method is taken, the legal tender that has been in circulation for a long time may continue to circulate. The currency problem in Central China is quite similar to that in North China. Our country's (referring to Japan) military expenses are still paid in "military scrip." But in general, the people's trust in "military scrip" is definitely not higher than the North China people's trust in "Joint Reserve Bank" paper currency. And in some inland areas, the Japanese military authorities have to purchase legal tender with their own paper currency before they can purchase any goods. It was previously predicted that the legal tender would depreciate after the fall of Guangzhou, but contrary to the facts, the value of the legal tender has instead risen, and the legal tender has become a heavy burden on Japanese bank notes in the above-mentioned form. The firmness of the legal tender may be due to the efforts of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. No matter what happens to Chiang Kai-shek's fate, the value of the legal tender will still be maintained because there is a surplus in imports and exports. The Japanese army will continue to purchase goods with "military scrip." This "military scrip" will be converted into legal tender, and then legal tender will be exchanged into foreign currency. Therefore, the fundamental problem is how to deal with the legal tender. This clearly requires the establishment of a bank in Central China that issues independent paper currency. Although the bank does not have to be engaged in large-scale activities, it should be fully strong from the beginning and able to</p>
<p>Sell Foreign Exchange - The legal tender may be temporarily ignored, and an attempt should be made to recover it within a specified period, as was done in North China. Efforts should also be made directly to increase foreign trade so that the "Bank" in Central China may increase its foreign currency deposits. The "Bank" should not be a purely Chinese institution, but a joint venture between Chinese and Japanese capital, and its new paper currency should not be linked to Japanese bank notes like the "Joint Reserve Bank" paper currency. The reason for this is obvious: if the "Bank" is prepared to sell foreign exchange, its exchange rate value can be allowed to follow its own direction.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Water Transportation in the Interior of Western Shanghai - Yesterday, More Than 1,000 Civilian Boats Sailed in Formation to Clear Goods Transportation</h3>
<p>In various places in the interior of Western Shanghai, conflicts often occurred between guerrillas and Japanese soldiers, so the small steamers and civilian boats operated by Japanese merchants dared not sail west. Recently, it has been learned that the situation has become more peaceful. Japanese soldiers send small steamers every day, carrying small steel cannons, machine guns, etc., to patrol the river channels in various places. All civilian boats with suspicious behavior must be inspected. Starting from about 10 am yesterday, until 3 pm, a large number of wooden barges and civilian boats, about 1,000 in total (including empty boats and cargo boats), sailed west from this port. However, when passing through the Beixinjing ferry, they were all subject to strict inspection. If they did not have the boat license and pass of the Civilian Boat Association, they were not allowed to pass. According to people from Qingpu County, the Qinghu long-distance bus has not yet resumed operation since it was attacked by guerrillas and bridges were destroyed.</p>

<h3>Puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an - Embezzlement and Malpractice To Be - The Japanese Special Service Department Is Greatly Enraged and Determined - Su Xiwen Is Instigating from the Middle and Will Continue</h3>
<p>The establishment of the pseudo-municipal government "to date" will reach five months. Now, due to the occurrence of undercurrents, there will be a major change in the inside story. Pseudo-"Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an will be forced to step down because he has caused dissatisfaction to a certain party. Su Xiwen, the former pseudo-Director-General and current pseudo-"Secretary-General", has the hope of being promoted again to pseudo-"Mayor" and making a fool of himself. The details of the various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rampant Corruption, Income Cannot Cover Expenditure - Since Fu Xiao'an indulged in his official addiction and lobbied a certain party in mid-October last year to reorganize the pseudo-"Director-General's Office" into a pseudo-"Special Municipal Government" and serve as the pseudo-"Mayor", he has exhausted all means to indiscriminately insert private individuals and increase redundant "staff" in an attempt to create a uniform situation, resulting in the pseudo-"Government's" monthly expenditure increasing from 400,000 to 600,000 yuan, and the corruption among superiors and subordinates is rampant, resulting in income not covering expenditure. In addition to spending more than 200,000 yuan of the pseudo-funds handed over by the pseudo-directorate, the pseudo-"Public Funds" are also heavily in arrears, amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan, and cannot be compensated for by borrowing from here and there. After the pseudo-"Reformed Government" forced the cancellation of the pseudo-"Consumption Tax" last month, the pseudo-"Government's" economic predicament was completely exposed and was fully known by the Japanese special service agencies.</p>
<p>Old Grudges in the Su Newspaper Erupt - Su Xiwen, the former pseudo-"Director-General", was overwhelmed by Chuan Xiao'an and retreated to the pseudo-"Secretary-General". Because his old grudges were not vented, he ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddhist scriptures every day. In addition to routinely going to the pseudo-"Government" to sign in, he did not care about idle matters. On the surface, he adopted a passive attitude, and his henchmen were repeatedly excluded by Chuan Xiao'an. He also did not show any bad feelings on the outside, pretending to be okay, but he was eager to take revenge secretly and waited for an opportunity to act at any time. This time, the pseudo-"Government" had an economic panic. Su took the opportunity to report Chuan's embezzlement of pseudo-"Public Funds" to the head of the Japanese special service agency in order to force Chuan to step down. The undercurrent between Chuan and Su erupted.</p>
<p>Disgust for Chuan Leads to Imminent Removal - The head of the Japanese special service agency, Major General Takeshita, believing that this matter was of great importance, in addition to thoroughly investigating the pseudo-"Government's" finances and confirming that Fu Xiao'an had embezzled a large amount of funds, recognized that Chuan was too greedy and not an acceptable puppet. He secretly inquired about the lower-level pseudo-officials' feelings about Chuan, who reported that Chuan's methods were too precise and that he was too harsh on the small puppets. Therefore, due to these various factors, he developed hatred and decided to force Chuan to step down. Su Xiwen, who had been frustrated for several months, regained favor and was made to succeed Chuan as the puppet pseudo-"Mayor". The Liang Hongzhi generation also had no right to express opposition to this opinion.</p>
<p>Chuan's Attempt to Struggle Has Very Little Hope - Unexpectedly, Su Xiwen, knowing that the pseudo-"Mayor" chair was a sure thing, deliberately pretended to be coy. The pseudo-"Order" was originally scheduled to take the stage and make a fool of himself on the 5th of this month. He temporarily excused himself that Chuan had not handed over the pseudo-public funds he had embezzled and that there was no way to handle the finances. He was unwilling to accept the new pseudo-"Order". The special service agency then used pressure again to force Chuan to hand over the accounts clearly. At this point, Chuan was trapped in a chorus of songs and had to go to Nanjing to complain to Liang Hongzhi and others and ask them to find a way to maintain his pseudo-position. The large amount owed will be gradually repaid by him. However, according to people familiar with the inside story, there is very little hope for this trip. At most, they will find another pseudo-position for him in Nanjing to maintain Chuan's face. The pseudo-"Municipal Government" will soon undergo major changes.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Overcrowded - Vacant Houses Rented Out - Property Owners Have Good Business - Second Landlords Make Huge Profits</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 7th, according to a report by the French Jianye Real Estate Company, the prosperity of Shanghai's house rent should be at its highest between 1931 and 1933. Afterwards, due to the poor market situation, rent reduction campaigns were prevalent everywhere. Since August 13th, although the house rent in the concession has risen slightly, it is still 20% lower than between 1931 and 1933. Although the landlords want to increase the rent, in the eyes of the court, due to the current situation, most of them are not approved. Therefore, it is still difficult to restore the previous prosperity. However, fortunately, there are very few vacant houses. All houses that can be lived in have been rented out, so the income of the landlords is quite considerable. According to the company, the beneficiaries of the current prosperity of house rent in Shanghai are actually the general second landlords, and the cost of top rent is surprisingly high. This is something that the landlords cannot stop. It is said that the company's business in 1938 was excellent. The rent it collected, the rent collected by itself was 735,406 yuan, and the rent collected on behalf of others was 1,814,163 yuan, and its existing real estate is estimated to be worth a total of 9,280,926 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yunfei Car Answered a Call - The Driver Was Strangled to Death - The Vehicle and Corpse Were Found in Two Separate Locations in the Hongkou District - The Police Are Investigating the Reasons for the Robbery and Murder</h3>
<p>At 9:30 pm on the 5th of this month, a Yunfei Company car with license plate 12403 answered a call at a hotel on Nanjing Road. The car was driven by driver Rong Dingrui. It was heard that at that time, there were two Japanese men, one Japanese woman, and one Chinese man in the car. The Chinese man instructed the driver to</p>
<p>Drive Straight to Hongkou - Unexpectedly, after this trip, both the person and the car disappeared. The next morning, they still did not return to the company, so Yunfei reported it to the police for investigation. Two days later, it was discovered by the police. A driver wearing a Yunfei Company uniform was found strangled to death with a rope in an empty, uninhabited foreign house on Jilin Road in Hongkou. After the company sent someone to identify him, it was confirmed to be correct. Later, the vehicle was found on Tiantong Road behind the Gongji Hospital in the evening. The intention is unknown, so the police are now investigating what the intention of robbing the car and</p>
<p>Murdering the Driver - And what the passengers intended to do, and are conducting a strict investigation in conjunction with the Japanese military and police agencies.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that on Sunday night or yesterday (the 6th) morning, a Chinese driver of the Yunfei Automobile Company was mysteriously assassinated, and a car was stolen. This caused the personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department to</p>
<p>Be Full of Doubts - The abandoned car was finally found on Tiantong Road in Hongkou at about 2 pm yesterday. The deceased was a driver named Yuan Bingfu (transliteration), 48 years old, who had been employed by Yunfei Company for several years. At about 9:30 pm on Sunday afternoon, Yunfei Company received a phone call to send a car to a hotel on Nanjing Road. The company immediately sent a car from the nearest station, with the license plate number 12403, driven by Yuan. As for who the passengers were and where they ordered the driver to go, the police department</p>
<p>Still Did Not Know for Sure - As of late last night. The only thing that can be determined is that the passengers ordered Yuan to drive over the Baidu Bridge. After crossing the bridge, the police department could not find any trace of them. Then the car did not return to any Yunfei Company station. At 7:30 am yesterday morning, just as they were about to report to the police department, Yuan was found</p>
<p>Strangled to Death with a Rope - In the garden of a certain empty house on Jilin Road in the Yulin Road police district. The Yulin Road police immediately received the news and sent detectives to investigate the corpse. They saw that the deceased had been searched beside him, and all his silver notes had been robbed by the murderer. After examination by the doctor, it was known that the car driver was strangled to death between 10 pm and 11 pm on Sunday night, and the corpse was abandoned in the empty garden. Then they searched for the lost car and finally found it on Tiantong Road in Hongkou at about 2 pm.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Traitor Gu Yongxing Concluded - Sentence Changed to Four Years and Six Months Imprisonment - Two Detectives Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Gu Yongxing (nicknamed Ma Pi Yongxing), the Chief of General Affairs and Chief of the Second Branch of the pseudo-organization "Yu Ya Hui", was arrested by the Public Concession Police for participating in negotiations in the case of the kidnapping of a Shen in Western Shanghai. During Gu's detention, he implicated Shen Jinwen, a Chinese detective of the Huisi Police Station, and Sun Aizhong, a Chinese detective of the Chengdu Road Police Station, which caused the Police Department to jointly prosecute them in the First Special District Court according to law. As a result of the trial, Gu Yongxing was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Shen Jinwen was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, and fined 500 yuan, and Sun Aizhong was fined 1,000 yuan. During the appeal period, Gu was returned to custody, and Shen and Sun were allowed to go out on bail. Gu, Shen, and Sun all expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The interrogation has been completed, and yesterday the judge of the Second High Court Yu announced the judgment, revoking the original judgment, changing Gu Yongxing's sentence to four years and six months of imprisonment, and declaring Shen Jinwen and Sun Aizhong not guilty.</p>
<h3>Zhao Dehe's Skull Broken by Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Zhao Dehe, a Ningbo native, 35 years old, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. At about 1 pm, when passing through the North Sichuan Road Bridge, the Japanese army wanted to check his pass. Zhao took it out a little slowly. The Japanese army immediately struck Zhao's head with the butt of a gun, breaking his skull and causing brain matter and blood to flow. He was immediately injured and fell to the ground. Later, he was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. It is said that his injuries are serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Singapore Road</h3>
<p>The residence of a certain surname at No. 1, Lane 256, Singapore Road, Western Shanghai, was suddenly robbed by four bandits at 5:15 pm yesterday. At that time, two bandits with guns guarded the people in the house, and the remaining bandits searched separately. As a result, the bandits robbed more than 240 yuan in cash and escaped. The owner reported to the police afterwards and requested to pursue and arrest the bandits.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Cotton Yarn Stolen from Haitong Yarn Factory - Zhang Zaixing Colluded with Ronin to Steal and Sell - The Police Still Need to Pursue and Arrest the Receiving Criminals</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Warehouse on Gansu Road in the Public Concession was recently seized by the police in charge, about 56 bales of cotton yarn worth about 20,000 gold. It was later learned that the plaintiff in the case, Han Changfu, the representative of the Haimen Datong Yarn Factory, after discovering that the goods had been stolen in February of this year, immediately sent a letter to the Cotton Yarn Association notifying all members to pay attention. The goods lost by the factory were 20-count white Flying Boat brand and should not be bought. Unexpectedly, the culprit Zhang Quanxin (alias Zaixing) from Anhui colluded with the Japanese and broker Zhang Shuqi to steal and sell the above-mentioned stolen yarn, 26 bales to a Chen and 30 bales to a Yu, each bale receiving 320 to 330 yuan in stolen money, which was divided and used. Unexpectedly, the secret was not well kept and the net of justice was inescapable. The police seized and dealt with it according to law. However, the market price of this cotton yarn is now more than 390 yuan, which is quite different, so the police still need to pursue and arrest the criminals who received the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>The Case of Bandit Leader Li Yongkuan and His Sons Assigned to the Second Special Court for Trial - Lin and She Narrate the Experience of Being Forced to Marry - All Defendants Deny the Accusations and the Court Debate is Postponed for Retrial</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, a salt smuggler from Anhui, and his sons Li Jiaqi, Li Jiazhou, Li Bihe, etc., made a living by selling smuggled salt in Pudong, Minhang, Songjiang Caojing and other places. After the outbreak of the August 13th War and the retreat of the national army to the west, Li and his sons gathered their followers in the Punan area and formed bandits. Calling themselves the Eleventh Army, they impersonated guerrillas and set fire, killed, robbed and did whatever they wanted in places such as Xihudang Ruanxiang in Songjiang County. The families of She Zhuping, who ran a pharmacy in Xihudang Town, and Lin Rongniu, who served as a village chief, were robbed three times in a row. Finally, Lin Xiuhua, the daughter of Lin Rongsheng, and Yu Yuexian, the daughter of She Zhuping, were</p>
<p>Two Daughters Kidnapped - And forcibly married to Li Jiazhou and Li Bihe, and Jiazhou shot and killed Lin's mother, Jiang, and dug a pit to bury her. In April of last year, after the regular army of the Sixty-second Division surrounded and confiscated the guns of Li and others, Li could not stand in the countryside, so he took his family members and the two Lin and She daughters and moved to Shanghai. It was already September of last year. After arriving in Shanghai, they lived at No. 11, Zhongxing New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Western Shanghai, and sent people to guard the two daughters, not allowing them freedom. It was not until the morning of December 10th that the two Lin and She daughters were able to</p>
<p>Escape in the Meantime - And threw themselves into the Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Catholic Church, requesting relief. The church reported to the French police, and on the morning of December 12th, the French police sent detectives to arrest Li Yongkuan and Li Bihe, father and son, and escorted them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. After a few days, Li Jiazhou was arrested at the intersection of Wuma Road and Shilu Road in the Public Concession and escorted to the court for joint investigation. After investigation by the detectives, they searched the homes of the Li family and found seven gold rings and one gold bracelet that had been robbed from the Lin and She families, as well as a fox fur man's robe and an ancient woman's beaded fur coat from the Lin family. After</p>
<p>Repeated Court Hearings - And postponements, the details have been recorded in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the court in this case is facing a problem with jurisdiction because the incident occurred in the occupied area of Songjiang. The Second Special Court has submitted a report to the Third High Court, which has forwarded it to the Supreme Court for designated jurisdiction. The Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court has now designated this case to be under the jurisdiction of the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, Xing Tingchang of the Liao Court continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants were represented by lawyers Dong and Lan Xuzhang. The plaintiff, Lin Xiuhua, the victim, commissioned lawyer Xu Yannian to act as his agent, and attached a civil lawsuit requesting the return of</p>
<p>Stolen Goods - And losses. The court was informed that this case would be retried. First, the defendants Li Yongkuan, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihe were questioned about their ages and origins. Yuan Jiahuan, the administrative director of the French Concession, stated the police investigation process and prosecuted the defendants for the three crimes of robbery, detaining people, and murder according to Articles 338, 348, and 371 of the Criminal Law. Then, detective Tao Ronglin reported the process of solving the case and arresting the defendants and searching for the stolen goods, and presented the stolen goods, gold rings, gold bracelets, and fur coats to the court. The victim,</p>
<p>Yao Xiuhua Claimed - That she was kidnapped on the third day of November last year and was forced to marry Li Jiazhou on the third day of December. She was unwilling. Li Yongkuan was the leader of the bandit team and ordered his sons to go out and rob. My family was robbed three times. On April 23rd of last year, Li Yongkuan directed his son Li Jiazhou to tie up me and my mother first, then lock us in the pig pen, and then drag my mother to the Yi Tomb ground, where Jiazhou shot and killed her with three consecutive shots. I request that justice be served.</p>
<p>She Yuexian Claimed - That Li and his sons came to my house on the ninth day of November last year, tied up and beat my parents, and forced me to marry Li Bihe with guns. Because I was forced, I wrote a marriage certificate myself and was then kidnapped, etc. Up to this point in the interrogation, the court ordered Li and his three sons to be interrogated separately. All denied the accusations of robbery, murder, and forced marriage. They said that the marriage with Lin and She was made by Lu Baoren, the doctor of Xihudang Town, and Cai Dingyi. The Lin family sent 64 yuan in gifts, and the She family sent 160 yuan in gifts. Li Yongkuan also confessed that he was once a captain of the water police team, but the confessions of the three fathers and sons were</p>
<p>Inconsistent - And Li's mistress, Yao, specially went to Xihudang to ask Lu Baoren and Cai Dingyi to come to Shanghai. They arrived at the case yesterday to prove the process of being matchmakers, which was also inconsistent. After checking the confessions of the Li father and sons, they were even more contradictory. Finally, Zhang Honghui, the brother-in-law of Lin Xiuhua, arrived in court and claimed that the two witnesses, Lu Baoren and Cai Dingyi, had come to my house the day before yesterday and asked Lin and She to not attack them in court today, otherwise their lives would be in danger. At this point, the court debate was postponed to the 25th for retrial. The defendants requested bail, but the court ruled that the case was of great importance and bail was not allowed. They were still ordered to be</p>
<p>Detained.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Chen Xingmin Ambushed Yesterday; Leg Shot, Minor Injury; Attack Likely Result of Case-Related Grudges</h3>
<p>Lawyer Chen Xingmin, a native of Ningbo, is 31 years old and resides at No. 7, Lane 568, Bubbling Well Road. Yesterday, a man calling himself Wang Liang visited his office twice, but Chen was out and did not meet him. Last night at 8 PM, Wang Liang returned and they spoke. Wang claimed to have a legal matter and several clients waiting for Chen at a certain address in Hongfu Lane, Yu Qiaqing Road, New Zha Road. Chen, recalling a previous case involving Wang, readily agreed. He boarded Wang's rented car, while Wang took a streetcar to Hongfu Lane. Upon reaching the lane entrance, Chen felt a sudden need to relieve himself and asked Wang to go ahead. While Chen was relieving himself in the lane, Wang suddenly turned hostile, pulled out a gun, and fired two shots at Chen, one missing and one hitting Chen's left leg. Chen fell to the ground. Seeing his purpose achieved, the assailant fled the lane. Fortunately, nearby police officers, alerted by the sound, arrived quickly and rushed Chen to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The wound was not life-threatening, and after bandaging, Chen was able to leave and recuperate at home. As for the motive behind the attack, Chen stated during the police investigation that he had previously represented Wang in a case, but the evidence was insufficient, and their goals were not achieved, possibly leading to Wang's resentment and violent act. The police are continuing their investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors of your newspaper: In your report published on the 22nd of last month regarding "Puppet Township Chiefs in Western Shanghai Taking the Stage," it was stated that last month, puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiaonan reorganized various "Autonomous Associations" into "Township Offices," with the original "Autonomous Association Chairmen" assuming the role of "Township Chiefs," and that six districts in western Shanghai were being piloted, including "Township Chief of Beixin Township, Wang Bie, Township Chief of Huacao Township, Zhao Jiayou..." I am a close friend of Zhao Jiayou and know that Mr. Zhao is not the aforementioned puppet Township Chief of Huacao Township. He is actually a company commander in the [blank] Battalion, [blank] Regiment, [blank] District Infantry Command of the National Army of Jiangsu Province. I am concerned that this may cause misunderstandings and unforeseen consequences. As a friend, I am writing to clarify this matter. I hope you will publish this letter in your esteemed newspaper.

<h3>Serial Thief of Escort Girls' Jewelry; Debate Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Chen Meimei, a female employee of the Shunfeng escort agency, spent the night of August 18th last year with Lin Genmai at the China Hotel. The next morning, Lin took her to the New New Teahouse for breakfast. Chen was persuaded to drink excessively by Lin and became drunk. Upon waking up, she discovered that two gold rings were stolen from her hand by Lin. Recently, Lin was apprehended by Hua Detective Wang Shanqing of the Old Zha Police Station and taken into custody by the Special First Court. During the investigation, it was discovered that Lin had committed three similar cases: (1) Zhou [blank] Qin, a female employee of the Xiaohuayuan No. 10 escort agency on Shantou Road, had a gold ring and a watch stolen from her at the Taoyuan Restaurant on Nanjing Road on February 26th of this year; (2) Zhao Yifang, an employee of the Yang Guifei escort agency at No. 25 Shantou Road, had a gold ring stolen from her while she was asleep in Room 163 of the Asia Hotel at No. 571 Hankou Road on January 26th; (3) Hu Ping, an employee of the Queen Escort Agency at No. 25 Shantou Road, accompanied Lin for one night at a hotel on January 21st. The next morning, while Hu went to the bathroom at the Xinhua Restaurant on Guangxi Road, 30 yuan in legal tender and a watch were stolen. This case was further investigated by Judge Feng Shide in the Criminal Division this morning. Zhao Huifang and Zhou Xueqin were absent due to illness. Only Hu Ping testified to the facts of the case. Lin fully confessed. Police lawyer Ru Bao [blank] argued that Lin's actions constituted robbery, or at least theft, and that Lin engaged in this as a means of livelihood, so he should be punished severely as a habitual thief. Judge Feng then declared the debate concluded and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>The First Inventor of Artificial Dyes: Dr. Perkin</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>Sir William H. Perkin was born in London on March 12, 1838. This year, March 12th, marks his 101st birthday. At the age of fifteen, he was admitted to the Royal College of Chemistry, where he was taught by the famous chemist Hoffmann. He progressed rapidly, and after two years, he was allowed to begin research work. His research question was to separate carbon monoxide from coal tar and nitrate it. Although the results were not satisfactory, he was not discouraged. He continued to do other research, which was quite successful, and he joined the school as a teacher.</p>
<p>In 1856, Perkin was engaged in studying how to make quinine, using commercial aniline to oxidize it. The result was a dark precipitate. Continuing the experiment, he created the famous aniline purple dye. The success of artificial dyes began here, laying the foundation for the modern coal tar dye industry.</p>
<p>Until 1868, Perkin never forgot the first thing he studied—carbon monoxide—and continued his research, obtaining a method for making alizarin from carbon monoxide. Alizarin is a natural dye. Although others, such as Caro, Graebe, and Libermann, also invented new methods of manufacturing it, until 1870, Perkin's factory, Greenford Green Works, was still the only chemical factory that made artificial alizarin.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Perkin had the noble ambition to pursue research to find the truth. Therefore, while engaged in the dye industry, he continued to study problems that had nothing to do with industry. Therefore, in 1868, he was able to publish the method of producing coumarin, and later he published the method of producing cinnamic acid. Therefore, all those who study organic chemistry know that there is a Perkin reaction.</p>
<p>In 1874, Perkin left the industry and devoted himself to scientific research. He built a research laboratory in Sudbury and spent several years studying the problem of magnetic rotation. In 1906, when the 50th anniversary of the invention of purple dye was held, many famous chemists from various countries went to congratulate him. Perkin died on July 14 of the following year at the age of sixty-nine.</p>
<h3>Coal Tar Dye Inventor - Perkin</h3>

<h3>The Shape and Size of the Earth</h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>That the earth is a sphere is now known by almost everyone. However, before the development of science in our country, it was universally believed that the earth was square and the sky was round. In Europe, as early as 340 BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle advocated that the earth was spherical, and had already roughly calculated the circumference of the earth. Although this theory existed at the time, because of the immaturity of mathematics, the simplicity of instruments, and the obstruction of transportation, it went on for more than two thousand years without any further progress.</p>
<p>The initial method of proving that the earth is a sphere must be based on astronomical observations, not from the earth itself. Therefore, treating the earth as a perfect sphere, that is, a sphere in geometry, is already in line with the ideal and is considered accurate enough. It was not until the 17th century that Newton, based on the principles of mechanics, first advocated that the earth was an "oblate spheroid." After the hard work of many scholars, this theory was finally proven by actual measurement in 1750.</p>
<p>After the 19th century, mathematics made great progress, instruments gradually became more precise, and measurement methods became more ingenious. Thus, on the earth itself, many arcs were actually measured, and calculations were carried out to determine the shape and size of the earth. This science is called "geodesy." In 1859, the Russian Xu Peite determined that the earth was an "ellipsoid," that is, the radii of its three main axes are not equal, and any cross-section is an ellipse. Following this, there was the theory of the "egg-shaped sphere," because the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth are not symmetrical, and the southern hemisphere is slightly larger. In 1872, this theory was denied again, because the earth is not exactly like an egg-shaped rotating body, but a very irregular shape. It is called the "earth's body" because it cannot be named.</p>
<p>In recent decades, research on the shape of the earth can be said to have not received much attention. Because the shape of the earth is too irregular, it is not very convenient in practical use. Only by assuming that it is an oblate spheroid, like the one introduced by Newton, that is, formed by an ellipse rotating around its shorter axis, that is, the earth's polar axis, can it be applied in geodetic surveys and astronomical observations. The difference between this oblate ball and the actual shape is extremely small, and it will hardly affect the accuracy of the calculation.</p>
<p>The size of the earth has three different values, all determined by its long and short radii. That is, the meridian circle passing through the earth's poles and equator at right angles is an ellipse. The axis of this ellipse, in the equatorial half, is the long axis, and the one in the polar half is the short axis. Scholars from various countries have slightly different values for the long and short axes that can be measured. However, in 1909, the American surveyor Hayford measured the long radius to be 6,378,388 meters and the short radius to be 6,356,909 meters, which has been designated as the international standard by the International Association of Geodesy and Geophysics in 1924, so it should also be adopted in our country.</p>
<h3>The Wonders of the Sun</h3>
<p>— Xihu Zhaizhu</p>
<p>As early as 214 BC, during the siege of Syracuse, it is said that the Greek mathematician Archimedes used many burning mirrors on the shore to concentrate the sunlight on the sails of Roman warships, causing the enemy ships to catch fire and collapse.</p>
<p>The French biologist Bnffon used 168 small mirrors in 1747 to reflect sunlight and focus it on one point, which could set wood on fire at 70 yards, melt lead at 33 yards, and melt silver at 16 yards.</p>
<p>Recently, the famous American scientist Dr. C. Abbott has created a solar stove using a similar principle, which can cook a rich meal using only reflected and focused sunlight. This stove can generate a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>That humans and plants can live and grow on the earth is all thanks to two hundred millionths of the total heat emitted by the sun.</p>
<p>In the UK alone, about 250 million tons of coal are mined each year. But according to Professor S. P. Langley's calculations, even if all the coal in all the coal mines in the world were burned, it would not generate as much heat as the sun emits in one-tenth of a second.</p>
<p>Hard and heavy metals on Earth, such as lead, iron, zinc, copper, and silver, would become gases and float if placed in the sun's lower atmosphere, just like oxygen and hydrogen float in the Earth's lower atmosphere.</p>
<p>It is calculated that the temperature inside the sun is about 80 million degrees Fahrenheit. If its colder outer layer were suddenly removed and the core exposed, the Earth itself and everything on it could melt and disappear, even faster than a snowflake disappears in a furnace.</p>
<p>Even a very small thing, such as a walnut, only needs to have its temperature raised to the above-mentioned temperature inside the sun, then if this walnut is in Japan, it can make China so hot that people cannot live in it.</p>

<p>The rusting of metal is only a trivial matter in the minds of ordinary people, but according to calculations by a famous American engineer, the loss suffered worldwide due to metal rusting is about 500 billion US dollars each year, which is more than nine times the total cost of President Roosevelt's proposed expansion plan for the army, navy, and air force (552,000,000 US dollars)!</p>
<p>This engineer told us that one-quarter of the world's iron turns into rust or iron oxide every year; in other words, it turns back into iron ore. Theoretically speaking, iron oxide can be refined back into pure iron, but in reality it is impossible, because most of the rust has been lost and cannot be collected.</p>
<h3>Scientific Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Curing Locusts</p>
<p>Locusts are very harmful. In ancient times in our country, there were people who caught locusts, and there are still people who do it today. Some people also say that it is a natural disaster, that the locust god is rampant and punishes one party's sins. This is the superstition of ignorant people in rural areas due to backward education. It is unexpected that in Western countries with developed science, there are things like this that are laughable. In past years, there was a severe locust plague in Utah in the United States. Trees and fields were all damaged. Most of the people in this province are Mormons (a branch of Christianity), so they supported the old and the young and knelt down in the fields to pray. The place was near Great Alt Lake, where seagulls (Gnlls) gathered. Seagulls like to eat locusts. In a short time, they captured almost all of the locusts there. When the prayer was over, the disciples were delighted to see that there were no locusts in the fields and thought that God had responded because of their sincere prayers.</p>
<p>Dream Fish</p>
<p>Louis Agassiz was a great biologist. He wrote many books throughout his life and made extremely rich contributions. Great European biologists such as Darwin and Huxley all praised him. He was the most courageous and精進 in his research, and all those who studied under him were influenced by him and later became famous figures in this field. When he was young, he studied in Paris and studied fish fossils in the museum. He happened to encounter an important species, but the fossil was too damaged and broken. He barely pieced it together, but in the end he could not get its characteristics. After studying it for a long time, he was physically and mentally exhausted. One night, he was so tired that he fell asleep, and he still remembered the fish in his heart. He suddenly saw the fish swimming in front of him, with every scale and fin clearly visible. The next morning, he sorted out the specimens, but he could no longer remember what he had dreamed of the night before. He continued to attack it, but still failed. After a few days, he dreamed of it again at night, and the next morning he forgot again. So he worked harder and secretly thought that if the fish entered his dream again, he should draw it in his dream for reference. So he placed a pencil and paper beside his pillow. After several months, he finally dreamed of it again. He woke up in the morning and began to work. He suddenly remembered what had happened at night. He rushed back to the bedroom to search for it and found the picture. Therefore, with his help, he completed the assembly of the damaged fossil, and the important characteristics of the fish species can be examined in detail.</p>
<p>Survival in the Whale's Belly</p>
<p>An Englishman was hunting whales in the Atlantic Ocean. A large whale swept past his boat. He quickly shot at it. The whale flicked its tail, and the boat capsized. The man was thrown into the sea, and the whale caught him in its huge mouth and swallowed him. The man entered the whale's esophagus and suddenly felt a great pressure behind him, pushing him forward. He groped around with his hands and found that everything was soft and smooth, as if he had fallen into a dark world. He knew very well that he would be buried in the whale's belly and would never see the light of day again. Gradually, he felt hot steam, which was extremely unbearable. He fell into a coma and knew nothing. When he woke up, he was in a hospital ward. It turned out that after the whale swallowed the man, it was killed by other hunters. They cut open its belly and found the man, whose breath was only alive. They sent him to the hospital. The skin on his face and body was eroded by the whale's gastric juice. (The man described this experience in detail in a magazine.)</p>

<h3>Talking Machine</h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhen</p>
<p>This talking machine, called "Voder," was invented by scientists H. W. Dudley and R. R. Riesz of the Bell Telephone Company's laboratory in England.</p>
<p>It is a portable machine that can be placed on a small table, and can be attached with several loudspeakers to reach a large audience. It has a set of keys and a dozen regulators. Technicians need to study how to mix and regulate the sounds it makes until they are proficient before they can use it and achieve the desired effect. It does not use any records. Technicians only need to press the keys and use the regulators to produce various languages. This is indeed the first machine to manufacture languages.</p>
<p>The Talking Machine has one advantage over humans. The sounds it makes range from the lowest to the highest, and can include everything, unlike the sounds made by each person, which can only be limited to a part. (Scientific Intelligence,)</p>

<h3>Solar Furnace</h3>
<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>Dr. Charles Wilson of the Smithsonian Institute in the United States has built a solar furnace on a mountaintop in California that can bake bread and cook various foods. The heat source of the furnace is sunlight, and the medium for heat transfer is oil. The furnace is equipped with a rotating reflector that can follow the sun from east to west, concentrating sunlight on a group of copper pipes filled with oil. When the pipes are scorched by sunlight, the heated oil in the pipes naturally rises without the aid of a pump and flows into the furnace, which is tightly wrapped in heat-resistant material. When the oil cools, it sinks to the bottom of the furnace due to gravity and returns to the copper pipes to wait for sunlight to heat it again. Because the heat-resistant material of the furnace can absorb a large amount of heat, the furnace can still cook for a long time even after sunset.</p>

<p>Lightning Protection for the Soviet Palace</p>
<p>The Soviet Palace currently under construction is the tallest building in the world. After two years of lightning protection research on the palace's model, engineers and architects have decided to use grounded metal plates as lightning rods for the palace. A 300-foot-high Lenin statue will be installed on top of the building, and measures must also be taken to protect it. The metal plates used will be connected to the ground via the steel frame of the main building. During the construction process, a cable-grounded balloon will be raised to a height of approximately two thousand feet to intercept any sky discharges and protect the ongoing construction work.</p>

<p>Huge Vacuum Tube Rectifier</p>
<p>Wireless vacuum tubes have made astonishing new progress and will be used to transmit millions of kilowatts of electricity over long distances. These vacuum tubes are up to six feet tall and can withstand enormous voltages and heat. At the generator end, they convert high-voltage alternating current into high-voltage direct current, which is transmitted along transmission lines. At the point of use, another vacuum tube converts the direct current back into alternating current. Traditionally, long-distance power transmission has been limited to alternating current rather than direct current because alternating current is easier to generate and easier to step up or down. However, with the current alternating current system, the economic limit of power transmission is only about two hundred miles. If extended to three hundred miles, leakage along the way will reach fifty percent. Now, if direct current transmission is used, there is no loss because there is no changing magnetic field around the power line. Direct current flows steadily in the same direction, like a river with a constant flow rate. Its flow rate depends only on the voltage of the transmission line and the resistance of the wire. The engineers' long-held wish to use direct current transmission has now been achieved thanks to the new development of this type of giant rectifier tube.</p>

<p>Extracting Magnesium from Seawater</p>
<p>A German chemist has recently invented a new method of extracting magnesium and has registered it with the German government. The traditional method of producing magnesium involves extracting it from ordinary magnesite ore. This new method extracts it from magnesium chloride—a component of seawater—using hydrogen to combine with the chlorine in magnesium chloride and precipitate metallic magnesium.</p>

<h3>"March 8th" and Donations</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The 700,000 yuan donation from women in Chongqing is a good example for women in Shanghai!</p>
<p>The number of wealthy women in Shanghai is no less than in Chongqing. And I believe the consumption of wealthy women in Shanghai must be more than that of wealthy women in Chongqing. Because Chongqing is far inland, the general enjoyment is simple. It is impossible to consume as much as one would like. Shanghai is different. In terms of enjoyment, everything is available, and it has always been a "leaky jar." So, if wealthy women in Shanghai, even those who are not very wealthy, can save a little and make donations, the results will be satisfactory. Although it may not necessarily exceed Chongqing, it should not let Chongqing take all the credit.</p>
<p>However, to this day, I have not heard of any actions taken by Shanghai women regarding donations. Why is this? Does what Chairman Chiang said, "The power of women is greater than that of men," only apply to Chongqing and not to Shanghai?</p>
<p>I believe that the power of women is greater than that of men in certain aspects; at least in frugality and almsgiving, women are more powerful than men. However, why are Shanghai women silent and unheard of regarding donations? Why is their consumption still increasing?</p>
<p>I am not saying that the patriotism of Shanghai women is inferior to that of Chongqing women; however, I must say that the active power of Shanghai women is indeed quite lacking. The formation of this deficiency is probably due to the fact that women leaders are unwilling to take the initiative, and people in society, especially the organizations responsible for guiding the people's movement, are unwilling to promote it from the side.</p>
<p>Now, "March 8th" has arrived. What we have already seen in the newspapers is: "In this time of national crisis, celebratory ceremonies are suspended," and in addition, there is a declaration. Although the declaration also says that women should "save the nation" and "make donations," we have not seen these concrete actions.</p>
<p>I do not believe that in a city as large as Shanghai, with so many wealthy women, there is no such thing as women's donations!</p>
<p>If wealthy women are unwilling to take the initiative, why do ordinary women and young ladies not contribute even a little?</p>
<p>The Shanghai women's community is so silent, especially regarding donations, so indifferent, that I simply have to say that Shanghai should not have a "March 8th"!</p>
<h3>The Death of Fourth Master Zhao</h3>
<p>— He Longsheng</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Fourth Master Zhao's presence in Jiangqiao was like that of a living Buddha in Tibet. Everyone knew and respected him.</p>
<p>As the war moved westward, gradually approaching Jiangqiao, Fourth Master's spirit became even more melancholy. Later, he instructed his family to quickly prepare their luggage and go to Xicun, sixty miles away, for temporary refuge. He also gave three hundred yuan in legal tender to his eldest daughter, urging her to leave quickly. Amid tears and sobs, his family finally boarded a small boat and left Jiangqiao.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>"Fourth Master, wake up! The soldiers are outside the city." The chairman of the Jiangqiao Chamber of Commerce, without washing his face or putting on his hat, rushed straight to Fourth Master Zhao's bedroom to discuss how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>"What? They're outside the city? Weren't they still fighting by the river?" Fourth Master asked in surprise as he sat up.</p>
<p>"We've run out of bullets here. The enemy added more troops last night, so we couldn't hold on and retreated into the city." The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce explained to Fourth Master.</p>
<p>"Hmm, so are there any more ammunition in the city?" Fourth Master asked urgently as he got out of bed.</p>
<p>"There isn't any. That's why I came to ask Fourth Master…" The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce was anxious when the sound of an airplane rang in the air. Fourth Master Zhao knew the situation was very dangerous, so he resolutely said:</p>
<p>"In that case, it's probably impossible to defend the city. Since there are no bullets in the city and reinforcements from outside won't arrive for a while, I think we should let the troops rush out of the city quickly. The troops can find ways to resupply outside. Once they have enough weapons, they can attack the city again. We people in the city can provide internal support. We don't have to worry about the enemy not being completely wiped out!"</p>
<p>"Buzz buzz buzz… Boom—"</p>
<p>"Buzz buzz buzz… Boom—"</p>
<p>The enemy planes had already started dropping bombs, and chaotic shouts immediately arose within the city; the cannons also began to thunder.</p>
<p>"Boom… Boom…"</p>
<p>"Boom… Boom…"</p>
<p>"Boom boom boom… Boom…"</p>
<p>"Pa'er, squeak—"</p>
<p>"Pa'er, squeak—"</p>
<p>"Guruguruguru, guruguruguru, boom—"</p>
<p>All kinds of strange gunshots rang above people's heads. Smoke billowed in the sky; the city center had already begun to emit black smoke, and flames continued to rise. Fourth Master was putting on his slippers and running down the street.</p>
<p>The situation was even more chaotic, and the streets were filled with pedestrians. Men, women, old, and young, their cries mixed together. Fourth Master's face was very bitter, but he did not say a word and kept running towards the Wenmiao, where the garrison was stationed. The plane roared wildly, and bullets continued to fly in the sky. Flames rose from all sides. The garrison in the temple had already set off. Fourth Master hurriedly ran out of the temple and ran to Xu Wenbin's house. Xu Wenbin was nowhere to be found, but his family was gathered in the hall, crying. Fourth Master felt that things were even more difficult, so he had to leave again; then he ran to the main street and knocked on the door of the Juxinyuan Restaurant.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" There was a response from inside, but the door did not open.</p>
<p>"I am Fourth Master Zhao!" Fourth Master had to announce himself.</p>
<p>"Ah! Fourth Master. Come in quickly! We thought you had already left."</p>
<p>The door only opened a crack, Fourth Master slipped in, and then it closed again. In another room, Fourth Master and the owner and cooks murmured for a long time before he came out. The restaurant owner, who was sending Fourth Master out, had a difficult look on his face; the cook behind the owner, however, was grinning.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>It was twenty-four hours after the * * army entered the city. Fourth Master Zhao, in his capacity as chairman of the local maintenance association, hosted a banquet for the * * army's officers, large and small, at the Chamber of Commerce. In addition to more than thirty military officers from the * * army, there were also ordinary local special figures who had been frustrated in the past but were now working for the * * army. To encourage the guests to eat and drink more, Fourth Master Zhao talked expansively about the * * army's kindness and drank a lot of wine. But before the banquet ended, he fell asleep. Everyone thought he was drunk, and they continued to eat and drink merrily. After a while, the guests all showed strange symptoms; some shouted about stomach pain, some said they were dizzy, and finally, they all fell to the ground. In the end, a total of twenty-six * * army officers and five local special figures died.</p>
<p>Zhao Siye was accused of premeditated murder, taken away, and, under the muzzles of the * * army's military police, dozens of bullets were fired into his woodenly unaware body.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Regimental Commander Ye handed the reorganization plan to One-Eyed Li, but One-Eyed Li couldn't read a single word, so he had to blush and hand it to Pockmarked Xiao. Pockmarked Xiao took it and read it once. The conditions on it were very simple. First, they had to hand over the list of guns and the names of the troops, and second, they had to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, and refresh the organization. However, the most important thing they were concerned about, their individual positions after the reorganization, was not mentioned at all in the plan.</p>
<p>Pockmarked Xiao winked at One-Eyed Li and handed the plan back to Regimental Commander Ye, sneering:</p>
<p>"Isn't this method just to annex us? If you want to annex us, just say so outright. Why go around in circles?"</p>
<p>Regimental Commander Ye's thick eyebrows jumped, and he put his hand on the cup and said:</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand, I mean well. I hope you join us so that we can increase the strength of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare."</p>
<p>"Thank you! Thank you!" Pockmarked Xiao sneered and cupped his hands upwards, saying, "Please don't use nice words to deceive us anymore. You are in Hepu Town, and we are in Tiaoxi Town. We don't interfere with each other…………"</p>
<p>Regimental Commander Ye couldn't bear it any longer. His square face turned red with anger. He jumped up and smashed a wine glass in his hand on the ground with a "ping" sound, saying:</p>
<p>"What do you mean, we don't interfere with each other! I am an official appointed by the National Government's Military Affairs Commission. I have the responsibility to protect the people and eliminate violence and maintain order. I can't let you bandits run wild in the local area and act lawlessly!"</p>
<p>This was a signal. In the sound of the glass breaking, the soldiers ambushing behind the screen door rushed out, each holding a rifle or box cannon in their hands. Seeing that the situation was not good, Pockmarked Xiao overturned the table with one hand, and One-Eyed Li added a kick, knocking the table over as well. They each pulled out their weapons from their waists. Although One-Eyed Li only had one eye, he could shoot with both hands. In the blink of an eye, a series of gunshots rang out in the hall, and the soldiers ambushing in the left and right厢房 also opened fire. In this T-shaped crossfire, Pockmarked Xiao shouted "Aiyo" and fell to the ground with a thud. One-Eyed Li, however, was still very brave, running outwards while shooting backwards with both hands.</p>
<p>Seeing that One-Eyed Li was so brave, Regimental Commander Ye was afraid that he would escape, so he took a revolver from Deputy Regimental Commander Liang and personally fired three shots at him. All three shots hit One-Eyed Li, but strangely, One-Eyed Li still ran outwards unharmed. (27)</p>
<h3>Two Puppet Emperors of the Song Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>——Random Notes on Reading History</p>
<p>When the Jin people invaded the Song Dynasty, they twice established puppet governments to implement the poisonous scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese. The first time was in the second year of Jingkang. The Jin soldiers attacked Bianjing and took Emperors Huizong and Qinzong captive, establishing Song minister Zhang Bangchang as the Emperor of Chu. However, when the Jin soldiers returned north, Zhang Bangchang also abdicated, only serving as a short-lived emperor for thirty-six days. The second time a puppet government was established was in the third year of Jianyan. The Jin people established Liu Yu as the Emperor of Qi. Liu Yu enjoyed being emperor for eight years before being deposed by the Jin people.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu were both traitors cursed by the ages, there was a difference in their degree of treachery. Zhang Bangchang became a puppet because he was forced by the Jin people, not voluntarily. Therefore, after he ascended the throne as a puppet, he still had some scruples and did not dare to act recklessly. He summoned officials and called himself "Yu" (I), not daring to call himself "Zhen" (We, the Emperor). When appointing officials, he added the word "Quan" (temporary), indicating that it was a temporary nature. He sent people to welcome Prince Kang of Song and himself pleaded, "The reason why I reluctantly followed the Jin people's establishment was to expediently deal with the situation temporarily in order to alleviate the national crisis. I dare not have other intentions." It can be seen that Zhang Bangchang was not considered a traitor, but only a confused puppet!</p>
<p>But Liu Yu was a complete and thorough traitor! Liu Yu became a puppet not because the Jin people supported him, but because he sought it out himself. He bribed the enemy Tartar. After serving as a false emperor for eight years, he not only had no shame or scruples, but willingly acted as the enemy's dog, leading troops to invade his ancestral country several times. He can truly be considered to have lost his mind!</p>
<p>Neither of these two treasonous fellows, Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu, had good endings. Although Zhang Bangchang later returned to the Song Dynasty, traitors and rebellious officials were not tolerated by national law, and he was eventually ordered to commit suicide by Emperor Gaozong of Song. Liu Yu was able to ascend the throne because he had the support of key Jin figures Tartar and Nianhan; but later, Tartar and Nianhan lost power, and his backing collapsed. The traitor lost his support and was eventually deposed by his master (the Jin people). The Jin people imprisoned him in Jinming Pond, and the false emperor became a prisoner. In the end, he died weakly in the enemy country. The endings of these two puppet emperors were equally tragic and can serve as a warning to current traitors!</p>

<h3>Commemorating March 8th</h3>
<p>— Gu Feng</p>
<p>Strengthening the Promotion of the Women's Movement</p>
<p>Although some Chinese women participated in the revolution as early as the great revolutionary era before the Xinhai Revolution, and some even died for it (like the famous martyr Qiu Jin), this was only a very small minority. It was limited to a relatively progressive small part of the educated people at the time. They were only a tiny fraction of the total population of women in the country, accounting for less than one percentage point. Although the participation of women in the successive revolutionary movements after the Xinhai Revolution had gradually expanded and become more popular, it was still a minority, a part. Therefore, strictly speaking, the real women's movement only began after the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance on July 7th. The July 7th Incident not only replaced the ancient Chinese nation with a new epoch-making symbol, leading the entire Chinese nation to unite and resist the violent enemy with all its strength, but also prompted women to embark on the path of liberation and freedom spontaneously and consciously.</p>
<p>During this war of resistance, the number of Chinese women mobilized undoubtedly broke all records in history. Under the first great * * of the War of Resistance, large numbers of returning women, along with the evolution of the war, have swarmed out of the kitchen, abandoned their love for their children, and joined mass organizations. They went to the front line and, under the rain of guns and cannons, engaged in rescuing wounded soldiers. They were busy with medical treatment and nursing under the Japanese planes that specialized in bombing civilians, rescue personnel, and the lives and property of third countries. They worked tirelessly in the front and rear, doing various national salvation work, working day and night without any complaints. They were as brave, capable, diligent, and hard-working as men. A certain foreign reporter, after inspecting China, praised Chinese women as the most advanced women in the world, which is a very faithful criticism.</p>
<p>However, what we want to clearly point out is that although the women's movement after the War of Resistance has made considerable progress in both quality and quantity, from an overall perspective, the women's movement still has the shortcomings of being superficial, fragmentary, and limited to the upper class. It has not penetrated into the ranks of working women, rural women, and lower-class women who account for the majority of women in the country. It has not universally promoted the women's movement to the border areas that will be the future base areas of the War of Resistance. It has always remained in the local prosperous cities. The adverse consequences of this are that it cannot cooperate with the universality and comprehensiveness necessary for the comprehensive and long-term War of Resistance, because they are dotted, linear, and unorganized.</p>
<p>Especially the women in Shanghai who remain on the isolated island, perhaps they think that the westward movement of the war is no longer related to themselves, so they still live as usual, playing cards, watching operas, dancing, and showing off, these occupy all of them, and at the same time, they carelessly use enemy goods, which makes the import surplus of enemy goods increase dramatically. In their eyes, the War of Resistance is a matter for some people.</p>
<p>On the occasion of commemorating the March 8th International Women's Day today, we hope that after the women have gone through the formalities of the meeting, the former women who have participated in the War of Resistance will, based on their past spirit, focus on in-depth and universal grassroots work, while the latter should immediately correct their wrong, absurd, and selfish attitude, and at least stand in their own positions and implement things that are beneficial to the War of Resistance, such as not buying and selling enemy goods, not going to chaotic places, saving and helping refugees, and soliciting donations to purchase public bonds.</p>
<p>In summary, if women want to complete the women's liberation movement in the War of Resistance, they must join the War of Resistance themselves, and at the same time, irrigate the awareness of the War of Resistance to the lower-class women's groups, so that the women's movement can develop universally.</p>
<h3>Sisters, Quickly Put on Your New Clothes!</h3>

<h3>Observations on Prison Paradise</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Up The RIVER</p>
<p>Produced by 20th Century Fox, Premiering at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>"Up the River" is a slapstick comedy set in a prison. Perhaps precisely because it is a comedy, the gloomy feeling of detective films is swept away, replaced by something like a sanatorium or club. The newspaper advertisements for "Up the River" say: "Enter the prison with a smile, as if ascending to paradise: come and go as you please, win trophies in ball games. You can meet your lovers, you can sing and dance, you'll have three square meals with wine and rice until the day you die." The depiction of the prison is so glorified that it is fascinating. Not long ago, we read in the social news about a person who could not solve his livelihood problem and confessed to stealing to request imprisonment. At that time, it aroused some cheap sympathy, thinking that his situation was sad and his person pitiful, and that life was as it should be. Now, after watching "Up the River," which "enters the prison with a smile, as if ascending to paradise," it is felt that this person who confessed to stealing is not without being a smart person, for "three square meals a day and a night to sleep," which is better than sleeping in a lane, eating leather shoes, getting kicked, and starving.</p>
<p>In this way, it is quite suspected of encouraging poor people to commit crimes. In the event that they follow suit and break into the prison, or are forced to hang out a full sign, wouldn't even the police authorities be at a loss? In fact, prison life is of course not as "carefree" as described in "Up the River," but we already have people who confess to stealing in order to get three meals a day and a night's sleep (in the United States, there will be people like this, right?). If you mistake comedy for seriousness, and want to ascend to "heaven," what will happen?</p>
<p>This seems like a groundless worry. Prison is not a free sanatorium, just as prison cannot transform society. However, to beautify prison and describe it as "paradise" is absurd, nonsensical, and useless. A fool who mistakes comedy for seriousness and recognizes prison as paradise probably won't exist, right? But what about the theme of "Up the River"?</p>
<p>The motives for making Hollywood movies can mostly be included in "business eyes." The absurdity, nonsense, and fantasy of comedy films are even more commonplace and not surprising. Therefore, in the prison, "winning trophies in ball games," "being able to sing and dance," and even men dressing up as women and dancing in strange voices, seem like a matter of course. This is why comedy films are welcomed by gentlemen and ladies and are getting worse and worse, which also proves to what stage the so-called art of capitalism has reached.</p>
<p>It is true that "Up the River" also writes about so-called "friendship": "Tommy wants to escape from prison to Spring Valley to expose a secret plot. When Morda and the two heard about it, they were willing to help him and agreed to escape on the night of the carnival in prison. Morda and the two thought that Tommy was about to be sworn in and released from prison, and that escaping from prison would be unfavorable, so they knocked Tommy unconscious on the ground at the time of the escape, and hurriedly dressed in women's clothes and pretended to be women." However, this is not so much to describe "friendship" as it is to sell gimmicks or to make the final climax come true. In the final climax of this comedy, these two escaped "star players" are needed to win glory for the Rocker Prison team.</p>
<p>In short, all the arrangements are to make the comedy film become a mixed bag. The use of prison as a background, to put it bluntly, is to melt eroticism, tension, and comedy into one furnace. Prison is the best background to become tense.</p>
<p>The director and the script are unified, and he also tries his best to emphasize this point, such as men dressing up as women and dancing. The actors are all second- and third-rate roles. Of course, what is needed for such a comedy is just winking, grimacing, and playing juggling, and the expression masters will have no place to use their skills.</p>
<h3>Weather Clearing After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Spring Arrives at Bixiang, Fragrant Snow Sea; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Fills Li Lake</p>
<p>Zhu Ai'ren said, "Then even if you aren't a big Miss, you're still a little Miss." Wu Junsu said, "Isn't that so? In short, adornment is their biggest expense and their most focused education. Actually, even if they dress up well, they might not go out to play every day; sometimes they just stay at home, at most visiting with a few sisters. At that time, I had already entered primary school and was studying. I dared to say in my heart that after they dressed up like this, who were they showing it to? Were they showing it to themselves? Young women in Suzhou couldn't really make a splash; things like 'social butterflies' and other such titles only happened in Shanghai. But when the war started, Suzhou soon became an occupied area. Could families with land still expect to collect rent? Some fields were already desolate; even if they weren't, they couldn't expect to receive any rent. As for city houses, some were bombed, some were burned, some were forcibly occupied. The shops they opened, some closed, some were looted, some were robbed. What they had always relied on for income could now be said to be completely gone. At that time, Shanghai still had concessions, so they had no choice but to flee there. Those who couldn't escape in time had no choice but to suffer in the guerrilla areas. We had a paternal cousin uncle who used to be a 'freehand friend,' what you might call one of the 'young master' types, who would stroll along Guanqian Street after a full meal. Later, he was truly robbed bare and had no way to make a living, and his family was waiting to be fed, crying out. He thought of a plan: he got a few packs of cigarettes to sell, carrying a tray to the teahouses to drum up business. This was because it was relatively light work; if it were something heavy, my uncle, being a weak scholar, wouldn't be able to carry it. But since he came out of his mother's womb, how could he have ever done such a thing? When he saw acquaintances, he used a fan to cover his face, feeling extremely ashamed. It just so happened that he encountered someone who had worked as a minor errand boy in his house, who was now a clerk in the 'Maintenance Committee,' drinking tea in the teahouse. Seeing him, he said, 'Oh! Young Master is selling cigarettes? Give me a pack of Platinum Dragons.' This scared him so much that he picked up his tray and ran, almost tripping. As for the women, because the enemy soldiers had no discipline, they often violated women. So, they all ran to the countryside to live. Some who were used to wearing high-heeled leather shoes couldn't even wear flat shoes, complaining that their feet hurt. But in the countryside, high-heeled leather shoes were not good for walking, and you weren't allowed to be fashionable anymore. They had no choice but to wear the cotton-padded jacket of a country girl, wrap a headscarf, and wear blue cloth shoes on their feet. There were two red 'tugboats.' They imitated the attire of Jiangbei people, tying up the legs of their trousers and painting their faces completely black with the soot from the bottom of a pot, making them neither black nor white. Even dressed like this, they sometimes couldn't fool the enemy soldiers. Hiding and covering themselves up was extremely difficult." (55)</p>
<h3>The "Prosperity" After Yidingpan Road</h3>
<p>— Xiren</p>
<p>Yidingpan Road, it is the only north-south road between Daxilu and Yuyuan Road within Ansi Temple. People from the Caojiadu area must pass through here to go to Xujiahui and other places; especially the people who work in the Caojiadu factory area and live in the Daxilu area, Yidingpan Road is even more their main road for getting in and out. Every day at dawn and dusk, it is the time when they alternate shifts, and the streets are filled with shadows of people coming and going.</p>
<p>I remember that in the second month after the 813 Incident, my footprints began to appear on Yidingpan Road. At that time, it was still a lightly made-up young girl, showing the demure personality that all young girls possess, without any strong atmosphere. Occasionally, one or two cars carrying beautiful young men and women sped past on the smooth asphalt road, making a whooshing sound, but otherwise, it can be said that there was not the slightest disturbance.</p>
<p>But now, it has taken off its plain makeup and put on a heavy makeup full of powder. Dazzling electric lights, flashing red lights, all the external features of a big city have been dressed up on this quiet road, creating its current "prosperity." The green grass on the left side of the houses has now been built with houses, ugly houses, and looking out the window, it is full of rows of black tiles, and the rural flavor of the past can no longer be appreciated.</p>
<p>But I have always had some doubts about his "prosperity": is it normal prosperity? Is it a deformed development?</p>
<p>The red light of the ** Company standing in the middle of the road flashes with despicable light, enticing people with wavering will to walk into their dens; to offer the hard-earned money earned from their own sweat and blood to the minions in those dens.</p>
<p>The fake "police" with yellow-brimmed hats and grass-green clothes are also a special embellishment here. They, the slave class without looting, have a wooden stick a foot long as their only weapon. Although they will take a few steps in the road, the scene is miserable enough, they dare not look people in the eye, and throwing the wooden stick around is their job, and guarding the door for gambling dens such as "clubs" is also one of the "specialized jobs".</p>
<p>Illusory prosperity is the true color of the deformed development of an isolated island city, but we do not need these, what we need is normal prosperity, but to build the foundation of normal prosperity, we must first drive away the demons that create illusory prosperity!</p>
<h3>About "School News"</h3>
<p>— (Yimin)</p>
<p>In the "Reader's Column" on March 4th, Mr. Ci Kai published an article "Talking about School Publications," the content of which was quite brilliant, but there were some discrepancies regarding "School News," so I am adding a few points as a supplement below.</p>
<p>Regarding the "School News" published in Shanghai, it does bear a special mission, which was founded by Qian Yiming and Jiang Ting of the Huadong United Middle School Alumni Association and is entirely personal in nature, with no connection to Huadong United Middle School. As for the "School News" published in Hangzhou before, although the position of the publication was the same, the background was different. According to the publication at that time, the one published in Hangzhou was presided over by Yu Gangfu and Hua Feng, cadres of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, and had a direct relationship with the China Youth Aspiration Association. At first, the publication was only a single sheet of four-page paper every week, but because the number of readers suddenly increased, it was changed to a sixteen-page booklet. The content of the material was more exciting than the recent publications in Shanghai. At that time, the number of copies sold in Hangzhou was about 1,000 or more, and those sold outside the port reached Ning, Qing, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hong Kong, Macau, and other places. The publication had already been registered by the Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of the Interior, and its title and font had been registered by the Ministry of Education, and others were not allowed to use it. It is said that the persons in charge of the "School News" in Shanghai also consulted with each other in advance. Regarding the reason for the suspension of the "School News" in Shanghai this time, it is said that it was temporarily suspended due to environmental reasons. According to reliable sources, it may be resumed soon, and it is said that the publication will not be issued alone this time. Every week, it will be temporarily published in the "Shanghai Ningbo Gazette," and it is already actively preparing for the resumption, which can be realized in about the next week.</p>

<p>Entertainment Circle</p>
<h3>Idle Talk on Opera in the Wine Tavern (Part 1)</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The state of the country is in turmoil, and the four suburbs are full of fortresses. Apart from sorrowful songs, is there still any interest in life? Occasionally listening to opera, my heart is touched, so I write it down, calling it "Idle Talk on Opera in the Wine Tavern."</p>
<p>One day, I watched Wu Dan Yan Shishan perform "The Bamboo Forest Story." Her beauty and skill were both superb. I heard that Shishan is the son of Jiuzhenfeng. If he is the son of Yan Jiu, then he should be the grandson of Zhu Wenying. Wenying is considered a senior among today's Wu Dan. In the industry, she is called Zhu Sishi, her qualifications second only to Yu Mao Bao, but her skill is comparable. Her son, Guifang, is also famous for his martial arts. Shishan has a handsome appearance, quite similar to Guifang. He Wuji is very similar to his maternal uncle. The Zhu and Yan families can be called a Wu Dan family, and Yan Jiu can be said to have a son. Yan Jiu back in the day, his martial arts were the best for a time, and he also sang Hua Dan, but he was too much, and he inevitably suffered from the criticism of seeking perfection. Shishan's martial arts, compared to his father, should be on par, and in terms of stability and graceful, it seems to surpass him. If he can transition from the "Riding the Horse, Stringing the Iron Bow" style of play to Guimen Dan, he can be expected to occupy a seat in the Dan roles. I hope Shishan will strive hard.</p>
<p>Later, there was Yang Shisen's "Pearl Curtain Village." Baosen is a descendant of Yu Shuyan. In the past few years, his voice and charm have been sufficient, but his strength is insufficient. The famous amateur Zheng Guoyi has a very deep friendship with Baosen and often worries about the state of Qi, not ashamed to ask questions and be foolish. I often wrote an article and published it in the newspaper, saying that Dousen's song is mellow and ancient, with the legacy of Huang Jing. When he is growing up, his middle qi is weak, so he cannot work hard, so there is less strength in his voice. If he waits until after the age of thirty, his physical strength will be full, and his tone will naturally be full. Time flies, and Baosen is now thirty. On this day, he performed "Pearl Curtain Village." From the appearance to the end, his sound and rhyme were clear and melodious, like a crane chirping in Jiugao, as full as the Yangtze River flowing through the Three Gorges. It can be called the ultimate in distinguishing turbidity, strength and softness. In recent times, well-known old students, those who pay attention to workmanship, mostly imitate clowns, taking the ability to nod and shake their heads, point to the sky and draw the ground as their ability, those who study singing mostly imitate Hua Shan, taking the ability to add words to let the board greasy slippery tune as their ability, and do not think from the perspective of the old student's identity. Baosen lives in today's world, does not cater to vulgarity and seeks accommodation, so that the song stage still retains the correct voice. I deeply admire his perseverance. However, there are two old versions of Li Keyong's sitting hurt poem: (1) "Taibai drinks a bucket of wine and writes a hundred poems, and the taverns in Chang'an sleep." This is Tan Xinpei's script. After Xinpei's death, the last two sentences were lost. Two famous amateurs in Peiping, Bao Dan Ting and Chen Moxiang, both knew it, but regarded it as an unpassed secret. Dan Ting once talked to Ping about it, and it has been twenty years, and I am old and forgetful, so I cannot remember it. (2) "Remembering the past when conquering Tumans, I killed the uncle of the state, Duan Wenchuyu, and the Tang King was angry and demoted him to the northern barbarians." Today's Jingjiao all read this poem. The two poems have a difference between elegance and vulgarity, and they cannot be mixed together. Shuyan did not teach this play in person. I don't know who cut and mixed these two poems, so that today it has become an order book. I deeply hope that Baosen will take Shuyan's strengths and work hard to make up for his shortcomings, so as to correct it, so as not to live up to this talent.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching Three Historical Films</h3>
<p>— Xitong</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, three historical films were released at the same time, namely: Hu Guang's "Mulan Joins the Army," Jin Cheng's "Meng Jiangnu," and Xin Guang's "Chu Overlord."</p>
<p>Among the three films, "Mulan Joins the Army" is the best. The screenwriter Ouyang Yuqian's technique is superb and novel, and the meaning is also ambiguous. The performers, Chen Yunshang, are graceful and vigorous, and they have done their best. These are the points that make "Mulan Joins the Army" stand out. Mulan's father, Shirong, dismantles the official document with Mulan's arrow, which is very natural and ingenious. When Mulan is about to leave, her parents both cry, but only her younger brother jumps for joy, which implies that the younger generation will be brave and diligent, and resist the enemy. The scene of Xu Qing under the moon is especially good, reminding people of a section in Liang Hongyu. However, using the moon to compare people, there is light but no moon, which is a bit flawed. When Mulan was discovered during the adventure, she failed to jump on the horse, and her skills seemed to be inferior to those of the Western film Brave.</p>
<p>In the eighth scene of "Meng Jiangnu," Songjiang City Gate, pedestrians had to bow to the guards before they were allowed to pass, which made people naturally think of the things before the limit. In the thirty-eighth scene, the old man presented a disturbance, saying that it was stolen, and the official actually accepted it, which also made people think that this was the truth. But later, the official returned the chicken to the old man, which seemed to interrupt the audience's association. I think the official should not pity the people, and after Meng Jiangnu sang, he should be ridiculed. The official should not be played by a clown at all, but should be played by Hong Jingling, etc. to be more meaningful; whether it is in line with the legend is not important</p>
<p>The dialogue of the Chu Overlord is simply a copy of "Historical Records," full of classical Chinese, which is not understandable by the general public, and feels a bit unnatural. Wang Yuanlong's Chu Overlord played very well, with no tears to cry at the end of the road, showing it particularly deeply. Secondly, I quite appreciate Han Xin (played by Chuan William), whose handsome aura is striking. Zhang Liang's costume should be more gorgeous and younger. The pork shoulder given to Fan Ha was too small. Finally, it is commendable to break away from the historical records, delete the two scenes of getting lost and persuading to cross, and commit suicide in the setting sun.</p>
<p>The war scenes of Chu Overlord are more serious and real than those of Mulan Joins the Army. The war between Shanjun and the evening is more like the real thing, because there is less open space on the screen, or it is more blurred. In the first few battles, there were only sparsely populated 20 or 30 people on a plain, like playing football, which was very childish. (Mulan Joins the Army is like playing volleyball, forming two straight lines.) If these scenes can reduce the open space and shoot closer, it will be more like the real thing.</p>
<h3>Li Qinian Sells Photos to Help Relief</h3>
<p>— (Sent from Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Hong Kong red star Li Qinian, originally a famous flower in Macau, later joined the film industry, known for her performance of romantic and coquettish women, and her success is increasing day by day. Now she is the most famous actress in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, her personality is proud, which is not appreciated by those who know her. Most of the people in the film industry are not on good terms with her, and the minimum acting fee for each film is more than 1,000 yuan. It is difficult for ordinary small companies to reach her. Chen Yunshang's meteoric rise and rapid success is "bestowed" by Li Qinian's "pride." At the beginning of Li's departure from the life of selling laughter, she went to Shanghai to join the Lianhua Company, but was not admitted. Because she was impressed by the acting skills of the late actress Ruan Lingyu, she stayed in Shanghai to visit Ruan's performances at Lianhua and studied diligently, gaining quite a lot of Ruan Lingyu's acting skills. Therefore, Li has the nickname of Ruan Lingyu in the Southern Country in Hong Kong. Recently, Li specially took 250 photos taken over the years and held a personal photography exhibition at the Gloucester Hotel, charging a 2-cent admission fee for the public to visit, and marked the photos for sale. All the income will be used for charity to help refugees. Among the photos displayed, half-naked photos account for two-tenths, opera costumes account for one-tenth, swimming photos account for three-tenths, and other horse riding photos vary. Although this is in the name of "relief," publicity is the reality, but it is not too critical, so it has gained the sympathy of the general public.</p>
<h3>New Year's Trends of Famous Actors in the Old Capital (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Lan</p>
<p>Li Wanchun has been performing in various theaters with the title of "Beijing School Monkey King" since he arranged and performed eighteen new plays.

(That is, Two Worlds Mountain, Shuangyou Ridge, Five Elements Out, Play Six Thieves, Snake Pan Mountain, Receive White Dragon)</p>
<p>Li Yanxiu is Shang Xiaoyun's proud student. Recently, a notice was published saying: "Respectfully inform you. Yanxiu performed in Qingle on the second day of the first lunar month (that is, February 20). She accidentally suffered from an epidemic and reluctantly took the stage, but she was unable to complete the performance and asked for leave. I am deeply grateful for the understanding of all gentlemen from all walks of life. When my humble illness is cured, I will do my best to contribute to express my gratitude and repay the elegant intentions of all gentlemen.</p>
<p>Ma Lianliang performed "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune" and "Ganlu Temple" in Xinxin on the God of Wealth Day, playing the Heavenly Official in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune." In Ganlu Temple, he played Qiao Xuan and then Lu Su, Zhang Junqiu played the Cowherd in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune," Sun Shangxiang in Ganlu Temple, Xiao Changhua played the God of Longevity in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune," Qiao Fu in Ganlu Temple, Jiang Miaoxiang played Zhang Xian in "The Heavenly Official Bestows Fortune," and Lin Qiuwen played the Weaver Girl. There are also "Caishiji" and "Hong Luanxi" in the first scene.</p>

<h3>Eccentric Wu Jilan</h3>
<p>— Ma Xiuzhen</p>
<p>Ms. Wu Jilan, also known as Jie, is a native of Luoyang, Zhongzhou. She was originally a lady of the Li family, but later changed her surname to Wu. Born into a family of officials, she was intelligent from an early age, with a bold personality and no trace of femininity. She liked to wear men's clothing and was also good at poetry. She was known as an eccentric genius. She once studied at a university and taught for many years. She first played the role of Miss Pu Er as a guest singer, and later went to sea from the ticket, working as a Qingyi Zong Meipai. Wherever she went, she was praised. Now she travels far to the southwest and is highly regarded for a while. The above picture is the latest theatrical photo sent by Ms. Wu from Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Silver Report</h3>
<p>Yihua invested heavily in the production of the film "Chu Overlord," which was screened at Xinguang during the Spring Festival, and the business was very prosperous. According to those who have seen the film, the scenes are indeed very grand and comparable to the Western film "The Fall of the Roman Empire."</p>
<p>The "Movie City Story," which has been promoted for a long time, has China's most popular actresses and famous Kunling and famous amateur actors as guest stars (including Sun Junxiang's Dingjun Mountain and Bao Youdie Zhang Zhesheng's Farewell My Concubine, with Bao Jun playing the qin, Dafeng's owner and Wang Ruoqi). It is said that Yihua plans to put this film in the theater that specializes in screening the first imported Western films to show seriousness.</p>
<p>Wen Yimin directed the film "Mysterious Madam," the whole play is sad and moving, the female lead is Lu Ming, Xu Qinfang, and Miss Wang Lian'gu, a famous female ticket player, made a special guest appearance, and has already started filming.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong will personally direct a film, titled "Swallow Li San," which depicts the righteous thief's robbery of the rich and helping the poor, which is very novel. Li San is played by Wang Yuanlong himself, and his younger brother Cilong will help, which is expected to be a gimmick.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (123)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Secret Story of the Jingzhong Temple Being Occupied by Incense and Fire Taoists</p>
<p>Later, the old Taoist Jiao died, and Wang Shaolou improved day by day. The little Taoist He then took Shaolou as his godson. When Shaolou first came to Shanghai, because he had no acquaintances in the press, He also went south with him to take care of everything. When he was in Peiping, as long as there were weddings and funerals in the Lingjie, their master and apprentice always rushed to the front, posting news in the newspaper, and taking care of the affairs all day long, and the shares they gave were thicker than others, so they were still on good terms with the opera troupe. Seeing that the time was ripe, they first started by building the two stone tablets erected in the temple on the walls on both sides of the second gate. At first, the handwriting was still very clear, but in less than two years, they erased all the handwriting and the names of the people who created the temple. A few days later, the father built a new municipal house in front of the gate and opened a porcelain shop, completely covering up the temple gate of Jingzhong Temple. Over time, many people now don't know where the Jingzhong Temple in the old capital is. Although the temple is also equipped with electric lights and telephones, the telephone book shows the Qingyuande Porcelain Shop. The upper and lower floors of the main hall are all under lockdown all year round. Driven by curiosity, the day I visited the temple, taking advantage of the old Taoist's absence, I poked a hole in the white paper on the lattice door with my fingertip and looked inside. I saw many plaques piled on the ground. The most striking was a horizontal plaque with red bottom and gold characters. The writing under the payment was very large. All the names were famous figures of the Bangzi class, such as Guo Shichen, Tian Jiyun, and Hou Junshan, all of whom were listed on it. In the center of the main hall, there is still a shrine to the ancestors of the Pear Garden. On the walls on both floors, there are very fine murals. The ground is also piled with a lot of areas. These things are very heavy and not easy to destroy for a while, so they are temporarily preserved. If a few more years pass, after the Yao Township brothers and other three or four old Ling workers all die, the old Taoist will burn the shrine, murals, and plaques together, and the relics of the Jingzhong Temple will be completely submerged. The existing Ling people in the old capital do not know the intentions of their master and apprentice, but you are also embarrassed by your friendship, and I don't want to make trouble. Fortunately, this is the legacy left by the hard work and money of the predecessors, and it has nothing to do with yourself, so why offend people? Famous Ling people with money certainly don't want to get involved in the interests of the temple, and even a few who have some financial difficulties are always responsive when they find the incense and fire Taoists. In this way, the Jingzhong Temple, which has a dramatic history, was occupied by the Taoists who guarded the temple in an invisible way.</p>
